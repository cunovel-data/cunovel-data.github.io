{"id":42239,"no":99,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 45","content":"O perpetual discoverer of the antipodes, torch of the world, eye of heaven, sweet stimulator of the water-coolers! Thimbraeus here, Phoebus there, now archer, now physician, father of poetry, inventor of music; thou that always risest and, notwithstanding appearances, never settest! To thee, O Sun, by whose aid man begetteth man, to thee I appeal to help me and lighten the darkness of my wit that I may be able to proceed with scrupulous exactitude in giving an account of the great Sancho Panza’s government; for without thee I feel myself weak, feeble, and uncertain. To come to the point, then — Sancho with all his attendants arrived at a village of some thousand inhabitants, and one of the largest the duke possessed. They informed him that it was called the island of Barataria, either because the name of the village was Baratario, or because of the joke by way of which the government had been conferred upon him. On reaching the gates of the town, which was a walled one, the municipality came forth to meet him, the bells rang out a peal, and the inhabitants showed every sign of general satisfaction; and with great pomp they conducted him to the principal church to give thanks to God, and then with burlesque ceremonies they presented him with the keys of the town, and acknowledged him as perpetual governor of the island of Barataria. The costume, the beard, and the fat squat figure of the new governor astonished all those who were not in the secret, and even all who were, and they were not a few. Finally, leading him out of the church they carried him to the judgment seat and seated him on it, and the duke’s majordomo said to him, “It is an ancient custom in this island, senor governor, that he who comes to take possession of this famous island is bound to answer a question which shall be put to him, and which must he a somewhat knotty and difficult one; and by his answer the people take the measure of their new governor’s wit, and hail with joy or deplore his arrival accordingly.” While the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at several large letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he could not read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. The answer was, “Senor, there is written and recorded the day on which your lordship took possession of this island, and the inscription says, ‘This day, the so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Senor Don Sancho Panza took possession of this island; many years may he enjoy it.’” “And whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?” asked Sancho. “Your lordship,” replied the majordomo; “for no other Panza but the one who is now seated in that chair has ever entered this island.” “Well then, let me tell you, brother,” said Sancho, “I haven’t got the ‘Don,’ nor has any one of my family ever had it; my name is plain Sancho Panza, and Sancho was my father’s name, and Sancho was my grandfather’s and they were all Panzas, without any Dons or Donas tacked on; I suspect that in this island there are more Dons than stones; but never mind; God knows what I mean, and maybe if my government lasts four days I’ll weed out these Dons that no doubt are as great a nuisance as the midges, they’re so plenty. Let the majordomo go on with his question, and I’ll give the best answer I can, whether the people deplore or not.” At this instant there came into court two old men, one carrying a cane by way of a walking-stick, and the one who had no stick said, “Senor, some time ago I lent this good man ten gold-crowns in gold to gratify him and do him a service, on the condition that he was to return them to me whenever I should ask for them. A long time passed before I asked for them, for I would not put him to any greater straits to return them than he was in when I lent them to him; but thinking he was growing careless about payment I asked for them once and several times; and not only will he not give them back, but he denies that he owes them, and says I never lent him any such crowns; or if I did, that he repaid them; and I have no witnesses either of the loan, or the payment, for he never paid me; I want your worship to put him to his oath, and if he swears he returned them to me I forgive him the debt here and before God.” “What say you to this, good old man, you with the stick?” said Sancho. To which the old man replied, “I admit, senor, that he lent them to me; but let your worship lower your staff, and as he leaves it to my oath, I’ll swear that I gave them back, and paid him really and truly.” The governor lowered the staff, and as he did so the old man who had the stick handed it to the other old man to hold for him while he swore, as if he found it in his way; and then laid his hand on the cross of the staff, saying that it was true the ten crowns that were demanded of him had been lent him; but that he had with his own hand given them back into the hand of the other, and that he, not recollecting it, was always asking for them. Seeing this the great governor asked the creditor what answer he had to make to what his opponent said. He said that no doubt his debtor had told the truth, for he believed him to be an honest man and a good Christian, and he himself must have forgotten when and how he had given him back the crowns; and that from that time forth he would make no further demand upon him. The debtor took his stick again, and bowing his head left the court. Observing this, and how, without another word, he made off, and observing too the resignation of the plaintiff, Sancho buried his head in his bosom and remained for a short space in deep thought, with the forefinger of his right hand on his brow and nose; then he raised his head and bade them call back the old man with the stick, for he had already taken his departure. They brought him back, and as soon as Sancho saw him he said, “Honest man, give me that stick, for I want it.” “Willingly,” said the old man; “here it is senor,” and he put it into his hand. Sancho took it and, handing it to the other old man, said to him, “Go, and God be with you; for now you are paid.” “I, senor!” returned the old man; “why, is this cane worth ten gold-crowns?” “Yes,” said the governor, “or if not I am the greatest dolt in the world; now you will see whether I have got the headpiece to govern a whole kingdom;” and he ordered the cane to be broken in two, there, in the presence of all. It was done, and in the middle of it they found ten gold-crowns. All were filled with amazement, and looked upon their governor as another Solomon. They asked him how he had come to the conclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane; he replied, that observing how the old man who swore gave the stick to his opponent while he was taking the oath, and swore that he had really and truly given him the crowns, and how as soon as he had done swearing he asked for the stick again, it came into his head that the sum demanded must be inside it; and from this he said it might be seen that God sometimes guides those who govern in their judgments, even though they may be fools; besides he had himself heard the curate of his village mention just such another case, and he had so good a memory, that if it was not that he forgot everything he wished to remember, there would not be such a memory in all the island. To conclude, the old men went off, one crestfallen, and the other in high contentment, all who were present were astonished, and he who was recording the words, deeds, and movements of Sancho could not make up his mind whether he was to look upon him and set him down as a fool or as a man of sense. As soon as this case was disposed of, there came into court a woman holding on with a tight grip to a man dressed like a well-to-do cattle dealer, and she came forward making a great outcry and exclaiming, “Justice, senor governor, justice! and if I don’t get it on earth I’ll go look for it in heaven. Senor governor of my soul, this wicked man caught me in the middle of the fields here and used my body as if it was an ill-washed rag, and, woe is me! got from me what I had kept these three-and-twenty years and more, defending it against Moors and Christians, natives and strangers; and I always as hard as an oak, and keeping myself as pure as a salamander in the fire, or wool among the brambles, for this good fellow to come now with clean hands to handle me!” “It remains to be proved whether this gallant has clean hands or not,” said Sancho; and turning to the man he asked him what he had to say in answer to the woman’s charge. He all in confusion made answer, “Sirs, I am a poor pig dealer, and this morning I left the village to sell (saving your presence) four pigs, and between dues and cribbings they got out of me little less than the worth of them. As I was returning to my village I fell in on the road with this good dame, and the devil who makes a coil and a mess out of everything, yoked us together. I paid her fairly, but she not contented laid hold of me and never let go until she brought me here; she says I forced her, but she lies by the oath I swear or am ready to swear; and this is the whole truth and every particle of it.” The governor on this asked him if he had any money in silver about him; he said he had about twenty ducats in a leather purse in his bosom. The governor bade him take it out and hand it to the complainant; he obeyed trembling; the woman took it, and making a thousand salaams to all and praying to God for the long life and health of the senor governor who had such regard for distressed orphans and virgins, she hurried out of court with the purse grasped in both her hands, first looking, however, to see if the money it contained was silver. As soon as she was gone Sancho said to the cattle dealer, whose tears were already starting and whose eyes and heart were following his purse, “Good fellow, go after that woman and take the purse from her, by force even, and come back with it here;” and he did not say it to one who was a fool or deaf, for the man was off like a flash of lightning, and ran to do as he was bid. All the bystanders waited anxiously to see the end of the case, and presently both man and woman came back at even closer grips than before, she with her petticoat up and the purse in the lap of it, and he struggling hard to take it from her, but all to no purpose, so stout was the woman’s defence, she all the while crying out, “Justice from God and the world! see here, senor governor, the shamelessness and boldness of this villain, who in the middle of the town, in the middle of the street, wanted to take from me the purse your worship bade him give me.” “And did he take it?” asked the governor. “Take it!” said the woman; “I’d let my life be taken from me sooner than the purse. A pretty child I’d be! It’s another sort of cat they must throw in my face, and not that poor scurvy knave. Pincers and hammers, mallets and chisels would not get it out of my grip; no, nor lions’ claws; the soul from out of my body first!” “She is right,” said the man; “I own myself beaten and powerless; I confess I haven’t the strength to take it from her;” and he let go his hold of her. Upon this the governor said to the woman, “Let me see that purse, my worthy and sturdy friend.” She handed it to him at once, and the governor returned it to the man, and said to the unforced mistress of force, “Sister, if you had shown as much, or only half as much, spirit and vigour in defending your body as you have shown in defending that purse, the strength of Hercules could not have forced you. Be off, and God speed you, and bad luck to you, and don’t show your face in all this island, or within six leagues of it on any side, under pain of two hundred lashes; be off at once, I say, you shameless, cheating shrew.” The woman was cowed and went off disconsolately, hanging her head; and the governor said to the man, “Honest man, go home with your money, and God speed you; and for the future, if you don’t want to lose it, see that you don’t take it into your head to yoke with anybody.” The man thanked him as clumsily as he could and went his way, and the bystanders were again filled with admiration at their new governor’s judgments and sentences. Next, two men, one apparently a farm labourer, and the other a tailor, for he had a pair of shears in his hand, presented themselves before him, and the tailor said, “Senor governor, this labourer and I come before your worship by reason of this honest man coming to my shop yesterday (for saving everybody’s presence I’m a passed tailor, God be thanked), and putting a piece of cloth into my hands and asking me, ‘Senor, will there be enough in this cloth to make me a cap?’ Measuring the cloth I said there would. He probably suspected — as I supposed, and I supposed right — that I wanted to steal some of the cloth, led to think so by his own roguery and the bad opinion people have of tailors; and he told me to see if there would he enough for two. I guessed what he would be at, and I said ‘yes.’ He, still following up his original unworthy notion, went on adding cap after cap, and I ‘yes’ after ‘yes,’ until we got as far as five. He has just this moment come for them; I gave them to him, but he won’t pay me for the making; on the contrary, he calls upon me to pay him, or else return his cloth.” “Is all this true, brother?” said Sancho. “Yes,” replied the man; “but will your worship make him show the five caps he has made me?” “With all my heart,” said the tailor; and drawing his hand from under his cloak he showed five caps stuck upon the five fingers of it, and said, “there are the caps this good man asks for; and by God and upon my conscience I haven’t a scrap of cloth left, and I’ll let the work be examined by the inspectors of the trade.” All present laughed at the number of caps and the novelty of the suit; Sancho set himself to think for a moment, and then said, “It seems to me that in this case it is not necessary to deliver long-winded arguments, but only to give off-hand the judgment of an honest man; and so my decision is that the tailor lose the making and the labourer the cloth, and that the caps go to the prisoners in the gaol, and let there be no more about it.” If the previous decision about the cattle dealer’s purse excited the admiration of the bystanders, this provoked their laughter; however, the governor’s orders were after all executed. All this, having been taken down by his chronicler, was at once despatched to the duke, who was looking out for it with great eagerness; and here let us leave the good Sancho; for his master, sorely troubled in mind by Altisidora’s music, has pressing claims upon us now. 太阳啊，大地的永恒观察者，地球的火炬，天空的眼睛！你促使人们使用凉杯；有人称你是廷布里奥，有人称你是费博①；在这儿你是射手，在那儿你是医生；你是诗歌之父，你又是音乐的创始者！你只升不落，虽然看起来你也沉落。我要告诉你，太阳，在你的帮助下，人们一代代繁衍；我要告诉你，太阳，是你在黑暗中照亮了我的智慧，让我能逐一叙述出伟大的桑乔担任总督的事情；没有你，我会感到虚弱无力，迷茫徬徨。 ①廷布里奥和费博都是太阳神的意思。 且说桑乔带着他的全体随行人员来到了有一千多居民的地方，那是公爵最好的领地之一。小岛的名字叫巴拉托里亚岛，这也许是因为那个地方本来就叫巴拉托里亚，也许是因为给桑乔的是个便宜的总督位置①。小岛上围了一圈城墙。桑乔刚到城门口，城内的全体官员就出来迎接。人们敲起了钟，大家显示出一片欢腾的样子。桑乔被前呼后拥着送到当地最大的教堂，向上帝谢恩。在举行了一些滑稽的仪式之后，人们向桑乔赠送了该城的钥匙，接受他为巴拉托里亚岛的永久总督。 ①巴拉托里亚与西班牙语中“便宜”一词的语音相近。 新总督的服装、大胡子和胖身子使所有不明底细的人都感到惊奇，就连知道底细的人也不无诧异。从教堂出来后，桑乔又被送到审判厅的座椅上。公爵的管家对桑乔说： “总督大人，这个岛上有个老习惯，就是新总督上任，必须回答向他提出的一个问题，而这个问题可能有点棘手，以便让人们了解一下新总督的智慧，由此看出他的到来究竟是可喜还是可悲。” 管家对桑乔说着这些话，桑乔却在观看座椅对面墙上的很多大字。他不识字，便问墙上画的是什么。有人告诉他： “大人，那上面注明了您就任这个岛屿总督的日期。上面写着：今天，某年某月某日，唐桑乔·潘萨就任本岛总督，祝愿他享职多年。” “谁叫唐桑乔·潘萨？”桑乔问。 “就是您呀，”管家说，“在这个岛上，除了您这位坐在椅子上的潘萨，再没有其他人了。” “那你听着，兄弟，”桑乔说，“我没有什么‘唐’的头衔，我家世世代代也没有过这个头衔，称我桑乔·潘萨就行了。我的父亲叫桑乔，我的祖父叫桑乔，所有的桑乔都没什么唐不唐的。我估计这个岛上的‘唐’准比石头还多，这已经够了。上帝会理解我。只要我做上四天总督，就会把这些‘唐’都清除掉。他们一群一群像苍蝇一样讨厌。管家，请提问吧，不管老百姓伤心不伤心，我都会尽我所知来回答。” 这时有两个人走进了审判厅，一个人是农夫的打扮，另一个人像是裁缝，手里还拿着把剪刀。裁缝说道： “总督大人，我和这个农夫是来请您明断的。这个农夫昨天到我的裁缝店来。诸位，对不起，上帝保佑，我是个经过考核的裁缝。他拿着一块布问我：‘大人，这块布能够做一顶帽子吗？’我量了量布，说行。我想，他肯定怀疑我会偷他一小块布。果然，我想对了。这完全是出于他对裁缝的恶意和偏见。他又问我做两顶帽子行不行。我猜透了他的心思，对他说行。他仍然贼心不死，还要加做帽子，我也同意了。最后，我们一直加到了五顶帽子。现在，他来取帽子，我把帽子给了他，可是他不愿意掏钱，还让我赔他钱或者还他布。” “就这些吗，兄弟？”桑乔问。 “是的，大人，”农夫说道，“不过，您还是让他把他给我做的那五顶帽子拿出来看看吧。” “那没问题。”裁缝说。 裁缝立刻把手从短斗篷里抽了出来，手的五个手指头上各戴着一顶小帽子。裁缝说道： “这就是这个人让我做的五顶帽子。我凭良心向上帝发誓，我没留下一点儿布。我可以让裁缝行业的监查员来检验。” 看见这几顶帽子，听了这场官司，所有在场的人都笑了。 桑乔考虑了一下说道： “我觉得这个案子不用拖延很久，明眼人马上就可以裁断。现在我判决：裁缝不许要工钱，农夫不许要布料，帽子送给牢里的囚徒，行了。” 大家对刚才那牧主钱包案①的判决感到佩服，对这个判决却不由得哄堂大笑。不过，他们还是按照总督的吩咐去做了。这时又来了另外两位老人，一位手里拿着竹杖。没拿竹杖的老人说道： “大人，不久前我为了满足他的要求，做点好事，曾借给他十个金盾，讲好在我向他要的时候他就还我。我不想让他因为还钱而过得比向我借钱时还窘迫，因此就很长时间没催他还钱。后来我觉得他好像不想还了，就再三找他要。可是他不仅不还我钱，还矢口否认，说他从来没有向我借过十个金盾；如果真借了，他早就还了。我没有证人能证明我把钱借给了他，他也没有证人证明他把钱还给了我，因为他根本就没还给我钱。我想请您让他发个誓。如果他敢发誓说已经把钱还给我了，我今生来世都不要这笔钱了。” ①此处有误，牧主钱包案是下面的案子。 “你有什么好说的，拿竹杖的好老头？”桑乔问。 老人答道： “大人，我承认他曾借钱给我。请您垂下您的权杖吧。既然他让我发誓吧，那我就对着权杖发誓吧，我确确实实把钱还给他了。” 总督把权杖交给拿竹杖的老人。老人把他的竹杖交给另一位老人，似乎有些行动不便地走过去，手摸着权杖的十字架说，他的确借了十个金盾，但他已经把钱还到了另一位老人手里，而那位老人忘记了，现在又来要他还钱。 伟大的总督于是问债主怎么回答，说欠债人肯定是已经把钱还了，他觉得欠债人是个好人，是善良的基督徒，估计是债主忘记了欠债人在什么时候和什么地方已经把钱还给他了，所以以后再也不许向欠债人讨债了。欠债人拿过竹杖，低着头退出了审判厅。桑乔见状也立刻要退堂。可是他看到原告仍等在那里，便垂头到胸前，把右手的食指放在眉毛和鼻子之间，若有所思了一会儿，然后抬起头，叫人把拿竹杖的老人找回来。老人回来了，桑乔一见到他便说道： “善良的人，请您把竹杖交给我，我有用。” “我十分愿意交给您，”老人说，“请您拿去吧，大人。” 竹杖交到了桑乔手里。桑乔一拿到竹杖，就把它交给另一位老人，并对那位老人说道： “上帝保佑您，欠您的钱已经还给您了。” “还给我了，大人？”老人问，“这么一根竹杖就值十个金盾吗？” “是的，”总督说，“如果不是这样，我就是世界上的头号笨蛋。现在，就可以看出我是否有能力管理一个王国啦。” 桑乔命令当众把竹杖打开。竹杖打开后，在里面发现了十个金盾。众人都惊奇不已，觉得他们的总督真是个新萨洛蒙①。大家问桑乔怎么会想到竹杖里面藏有十个金盾。桑乔回答说，他见那个老头把竹杖交给了对方，才发誓说确实把钱还了，可是发完誓以后又把竹杖要了回来，于是他就猜到那十个金盾在竹杖里面。由此人们可以推断出，有些总督虽然笨，却有上帝指引他们断案。另外，桑乔曾听村里的神甫讲过一个类似的案子。若不是桑乔偶尔会把他想记住的事情忘掉，整个岛上恐怕找不出比他更好的记性呢。最后，两位老人一个满面愧色，另一个拿到了钱，一同离去了。在场的人都深感意外，为桑乔写传的人也拿不定桑乔到底是愚蠢还是聪明了。 ①古代一贤王，以善断疑案著称。 这个案子刚了结，又进来一个女人。她紧紧抓着一个男人，看打扮，那男人是个富裕的牧主。女人边走边喊： “请您主持公道啊，总督大人，请您主持公道！如果我在地上找不到公道，就只好上天去找了！尊贵的总督大人，这个臭男人在田里抓住了我，像用破抹布似的把我糟蹋了。我真倒霉，我守了二十三年多，躲过了摩尔人和基督徒，躲过了当地人和外来人。我一直守身如玉，平安无事或是逢凶化吉，结果到头来却让这个家伙坐享其成了。” “这个男人是否坐享其成，还得调查呢。”桑乔说。 桑乔转身问那个男人，对于那女人的指责有什么可说的。 那人已慌成一团，答道： “诸位大人，我是个可怜的牧主。今天上午我出去卖——对不起，恕我失言，卖了四头猪。交了贸易税和其他各种苛税杂税后，刚刚够本。在回村的路上，我碰到了这个臭婆娘，我们竟鬼使神差地混到了一起。我付了她足够的钱，可她还不满足，揪住我不放，把我拽到这儿，说我强奸了她。我发誓，我马上就发誓，她撒谎。这就是全部真相，一点儿不假。” 总督问他身上是否带着钱。牧主说他怀里的一个皮钱包里有二十杜卡多。总督让他把皮钱包拿出来，原封不动地交给那女人。牧主颤抖着把钱包掏了出来。女人把钱包拿过去，向所有人千恩万谢，又祈求上帝让保护苦难弱女的总督健康长寿，然后双手抓着钱包走出了审判厅。不过，在走出去之前，她已经看到了钱包里确实有钱。牧主眼含泪水地一直盯着自己的钱包。那女人刚走出去，桑乔就对牧主说： “喂，你去跟着那女人，不管她答应不答应，都要把钱包抢回来，然后再同她一起回到这儿来。” 桑乔这句话可没白说。收主立刻闪电般地冲出去抢钱包。所有在场的人都莫名其妙，等着看这个案子怎样收场。过了一会儿，这一男一女就回来了，两人比先前扭得还紧。那女人提着裙子，把钱包放在裙兜里。牧主想把钱包夺回来，可那女人一直死死护着，竟夺不回来。那女人大声喊道： “让上帝和世人主持一下公道吧，您看看，总督大人，这个没心没肺的东西多不要脸，多大的胆子，竟敢在光天化日之下把您判给我的钱包抢回去！” “他把钱包抢走了吗？”总督问。 “抢走？”那女人说，“谁要想抢走这钱包，得先要了我的命。这个宝贝儿！别人或许还能吓唬吓唬我，但不是这个令人恶心的倒霉鬼！即使用钳子、锤子、榔头、凿子，他也休想把钱包从我手里抢走，就是用狮爪子也不行，除非先把我杀了！” “她说得对，”牧主说，“我服输了。我承认我没那么大力气把钱包从她那儿夺回来。只好这样了。” 于是，总督对那女人说： “正直而又勇敢的女人，把那钱包拿出来让我看看。” 女人把钱包递给总督，总督又把钱包递给了牧主，然后对那个力大无比的女人说道： “我说大姐呀，如果你用你刚才保护钱包的勇气和力量来保护自己的身体，即使是赫拉克勒斯也不能奈何你！你趁早滚蛋吧，滚出这个岛屿，滚得远远的，否则就打你二百鞭子。 赶紧滚吧，你这个骗子，不要脸的东西！” 那女人吓坏了，低着头，垂头丧气地走了。 “臭东西，带着你的钱滚回去吧。如果你不想再赔钱的话，从今以后就再也不要跟谁鬼混了。” 牧主十分尴尬地道了谢，然后走了。周围的人再次对新总督的判断感到佩服。这些都被桑乔的传记作者记了下来，并且送到了公爵那儿，公爵正急着要看呢！ 桑乔的事就先写到这儿，咱们赶紧去看看他的主人吧。唐吉诃德这时正被阿尔蒂西多拉的音乐弄得神魂颠倒呢。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4666.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
