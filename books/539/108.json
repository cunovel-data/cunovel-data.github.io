{"id":42248,"no":108,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 54","content":"The duke and duchess resolved that the challenge Don Quixote had, for the reason already mentioned, given their vassal, should be proceeded with; and as the young man was in Flanders, whither he had fled to escape having Dona Rodriguez for a mother-in-law, they arranged to substitute for him a Gascon lacquey, named Tosilos, first of all carefully instructing him in all he had to do. Two days later the duke told Don Quixote that in four days from that time his opponent would present himself on the field of battle armed as a knight, and would maintain that the damsel lied by half a beard, nay a whole beard, if she affirmed that he had given her a promise of marriage. Don Quixote was greatly pleased at the news, and promised himself to do wonders in the lists, and reckoned it rare good fortune that an opportunity should have offered for letting his noble hosts see what the might of his strong arm was capable of; and so in high spirits and satisfaction he awaited the expiration of the four days, which measured by his impatience seemed spinning themselves out into four hundred ages. Let us leave them to pass as we do other things, and go and bear Sancho company, as mounted on Dapple, half glad, half sad, he paced along on his road to join his master, in whose society he was happier than in being governor of all the islands in the world. Well then, it so happened that before he had gone a great way from the island of his government (and whether it was island, city, town, or village that he governed he never troubled himself to inquire) he saw coming along the road he was travelling six pilgrims with staves, foreigners of that sort that beg for alms singing; who as they drew near arranged themselves in a line and lifting up their voices all together began to sing in their own language something that Sancho could not with the exception of one word which sounded plainly “alms,” from which he gathered that it was alms they asked for in their song; and being, as Cide Hamete says, remarkably charitable, he took out of his alforias the half loaf and half cheese he had been provided with, and gave them to them, explaining to them by signs that he had nothing else to give them. They received them very gladly, but exclaimed, “Geld! Geld!” “I don’t understand what you want of me, good people,” said Sancho. On this one of them took a purse out of his bosom and showed it to Sancho, by which he comprehended they were asking for money, and putting his thumb to his throat and spreading his hand upwards he gave them to understand that he had not the sign of a coin about him, and urging Dapple forward he broke through them. But as he was passing, one of them who had been examining him very closely rushed towards him, and flinging his arms round him exclaimed in a loud voice and good Spanish, “God bless me! What’s this I see? Is it possible that I hold in my arms my dear friend, my good neighbour Sancho Panza? But there’s no doubt about it, for I’m not asleep, nor am I drunk just now.” Sancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and find himself embraced by a foreign pilgrim, and after regarding him steadily without speaking he was still unable to recognise him; but the pilgrim perceiving his perplexity cried, “What! and is it possible, Sancho Panza, that thou dost not know thy neighbour Ricote, the Morisco shopkeeper of thy village?” Sancho upon this looking at him more carefully began to recall his features, and at last recognised him perfectly, and without getting off the ass threw his arms round his neck saying, “Who the devil could have known thee, Ricote, in this mummer’s dress thou art in? Tell me, who bas frenchified thee, and how dost thou dare to return to Spain, where if they catch thee and recognise thee it will go hard enough with thee?” “If thou dost not betray me, Sancho,” said the pilgrim, “I am safe; for in this dress no one will recognise me; but let us turn aside out of the road into that grove there where my comrades are going to eat and rest, and thou shalt eat with them there, for they are very good fellows; I’ll have time enough to tell thee then all that has happened me since I left our village in obedience to his Majesty’s edict that threatened such severities against the unfortunate people of my nation, as thou hast heard.” Sancho complied, and Ricote having spoken to the other pilgrims they withdrew to the grove they saw, turning a considerable distance out of the road. They threw down their staves, took off their pilgrim’s cloaks and remained in their under-clothing; they were all good-looking young fellows, except Ricote, who was a man somewhat advanced in years. They carried alforjas all of them, and all apparently well filled, at least with things provocative of thirst, such as would summon it from two leagues off. They stretched themselves on the ground, and making a tablecloth of the grass they spread upon it bread, salt, knives, walnut, scraps of cheese, and well-picked ham-bones which if they were past gnawing were not past sucking. They also put down a black dainty called, they say, caviar, and made of the eggs of fish, a great thirst-wakener. Nor was there any lack of olives, dry, it is true, and without any seasoning, but for all that toothsome and pleasant. But what made the best show in the field of the banquet was half a dozen botas of wine, for each of them produced his own from his alforjas; even the good Ricote, who from a Morisco had transformed himself into a German or Dutchman, took out his, which in size might have vied with the five others. They then began to eat with very great relish and very leisurely, making the most of each morsel — very small ones of everything — they took up on the point of the knife; and then all at the same moment raised their arms and botas aloft, the mouths placed in their mouths, and all eyes fixed on heaven just as if they were taking aim at it; and in this attitude they remained ever so long, wagging their heads from side to side as if in acknowledgment of the pleasure they were enjoying while they decanted the bowels of the bottles into their own stomachs. Sancho beheld all, “and nothing gave him pain;” so far from that, acting on the proverb he knew so well, “when thou art at Rome do as thou seest,” he asked Ricote for his bota and took aim like the rest of them, and with not less enjoyment. Four times did the botas bear being uplifted, but the fifth it was all in vain, for they were drier and more sapless than a rush by that time, which made the jollity that had been kept up so far begin to flag. Every now and then some one of them would grasp Sancho’s right hand in his own saying, “Espanoli y Tudesqui tuto uno: bon compano;” and Sancho would answer, “Bon compano, jur a Di!” and then go off into a fit of laughter that lasted an hour, without a thought for the moment of anything that had befallen him in his government; for cares have very little sway over us while we are eating and drinking. At length, the wine having come to an end with them, drowsiness began to come over them, and they dropped asleep on their very table and tablecloth. Ricote and Sancho alone remained awake, for they had eaten more and drunk less, and Ricote drawing Sancho aside, they seated themselves at the foot of a beech, leaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep; and without once falling into his own Morisco tongue Ricote spoke as follows in pure Castilian: “Thou knowest well, neighbour and friend Sancho Panza, how the proclamation or edict his Majesty commanded to be issued against those of my nation filled us all with terror and dismay; me at least it did, insomuch that I think before the time granted us for quitting Spain was out, the full force of the penalty had already fallen upon me and upon my children. I decided, then, and I think wisely (just like one who knows that at a certain date the house he lives in will be taken from him, and looks out beforehand for another to change into), I decided, I say, to leave the town myself, alone and without my family, and go to seek out some place to remove them to comfortably and not in the hurried way in which the others took their departure; for I saw very plainly, and so did all the older men among us, that the proclamations were not mere threats, as some said, but positive enactments which would be enforced at the appointed time; and what made me believe this was what I knew of the base and extravagant designs which our people harboured, designs of such a nature that I think it was a divine inspiration that moved his Majesty to carry out a resolution so spirited; not that we were all guilty, for some there were true and steadfast Christians; but they were so few that they could make no head against those who were not; and it was not prudent to cherish a viper in the bosom by having enemies in the house. In short it was with just cause that we were visited with the penalty of banishment, a mild and lenient one in the eyes of some, but to us the most terrible that could be inflicted upon us. Wherever we are we weep for Spain; for after all we were born there and it is our natural fatherland. Nowhere do we find the reception our unhappy condition needs; and in Barbary and all the parts of Africa where we counted upon being received, succoured, and welcomed, it is there they insult and ill-treat us most. We knew not our good fortune until we lost it; and such is the longing we almost all of us have to return to Spain, that most of those who like myself know the language, and there are many who do, come back to it and leave their wives and children forsaken yonder, so great is their love for it; and now I know by experience the meaning of the saying, sweet is the love of one’s country. “I left our village, as I said, and went to France, but though they gave us a kind reception there I was anxious to see all I could. I crossed into Italy, and reached Germany, and there it seemed to me we might live with more freedom, as the inhabitants do not pay any attention to trifling points; everyone lives as he likes, for in most parts they enjoy liberty of conscience. I took a house in a town near Augsburg, and then joined these pilgrims, who are in the habit of coming to Spain in great numbers every year to visit the shrines there, which they look upon as their Indies and a sure and certain source of gain. They travel nearly all over it, and there is no town out of which they do not go full up of meat and drink, as the saying is, and with a real, at least, in money, and they come off at the end of their travels with more than a hundred crowns saved, which, changed into gold, they smuggle out of the kingdom either in the hollow of their staves or in the patches of their pilgrim’s cloaks or by some device of their own, and carry to their own country in spite of the guards at the posts and passes where they are searched. Now my purpose is, Sancho, to carry away the treasure that I left buried, which, as it is outside the town, I shall be able to do without risk, and to write, or cross over from Valencia, to my daughter and wife, who I know are at Algiers, and find some means of bringing them to some French port and thence to Germany, there to await what it may be God’s will to do with us; for, after all, Sancho, I know well that Ricota my daughter and Francisca Ricota my wife are Catholic Christians, and though I am not so much so, still I am more of a Christian than a Moor, and it is always my prayer to God that he will open the eyes of my understanding and show me how I am to serve him; but what amazes me and I cannot understand is why my wife and daughter should have gone to Barbary rather than to France, where they could live as Christians.” To this Sancho replied, “Remember, Ricote, that may not have been open to them, for Juan Tiopieyo thy wife’s brother took them, and being a true Moor he went where he could go most easily; and another thing I can tell thee, it is my belief thou art going in vain to look for what thou hast left buried, for we heard they took from thy brother-in-law and thy wife a great quantity of pearls and money in gold which they brought to be passed.” “That may be,” said Ricote; “but I know they did not touch my hoard, for I did not tell them where it was, for fear of accidents; and so, if thou wilt come with me, Sancho, and help me to take it away and conceal it, I will give thee two hundred crowns wherewith thou mayest relieve thy necessities, and, as thou knowest, I know they are many.” “I would do it,” said Sancho; “but I am not at all covetous, for I gave up an office this morning in which, if I was, I might have made the walls of my house of gold and dined off silver plates before six months were over; and so for this reason, and because I feel I would be guilty of treason to my king if I helped his enemies, I would not go with thee if instead of promising me two hundred crowns thou wert to give me four hundred here in hand.” “And what office is this thou hast given up, Sancho?” asked Ricote. “I have given up being governor of an island,” said Sancho, “and such a one, faith, as you won’t find the like of easily.” “And where is this island?” said Ricote. “Where?” said Sancho; “two leagues from here, and it is called the island of Barataria.” “Nonsense! Sancho,” said Ricote; “islands are away out in the sea; there are no islands on the mainland.” “What? No islands!” said Sancho; “I tell thee, friend Ricote, I left it this morning, and yesterday I was governing there as I pleased like a sagittarius; but for all that I gave it up, for it seemed to me a dangerous office, a governor’s .” “And what hast thou gained by the government?” asked Ricote. “I have gained,” said Sancho, “the knowledge that I am no good for governing, unless it is a drove of cattle, and that the riches that are to be got by these governments are got at the cost of one’s rest and sleep, ay and even one’s food; for in islands the governors must eat little, especially if they have doctors to look after their health.” “I don’t understand thee, Sancho,” said Ricote; “but it seems to me all nonsense thou art talking. Who would give thee islands to govern? Is there any scarcity in the world of cleverer men than thou art for governors? Hold thy peace, Sancho, and come back to thy senses, and consider whether thou wilt come with me as I said to help me to take away treasure I left buried (for indeed it may be called a treasure, it is so large), and I will give thee wherewithal to keep thee, as I told thee.” “And I have told thee already, Ricote, that I will not,” said Sancho; “let it content thee that by me thou shalt not be betrayed, and go thy way in God’s name and let me go mine; for I know that well-gotten gain may be lost, but ill-gotten gain is lost, itself and its owner likewise.” “I will not press thee, Sancho,” said Ricote; “but tell me, wert thou in our village when my wife and daughter and brother-in-law left it?” “I was so,” said Sancho; “and I can tell thee thy daughter left it looking so lovely that all the village turned out to see her, and everybody said she was the fairest creature in the world. She wept as she went, and embraced all her friends and acquaintances and those who came out to see her, and she begged them all to commend her to God and Our Lady his mother, and this in such a touching way that it made me weep myself, though I’m not much given to tears commonly; and, faith, many a one would have liked to hide her, or go out and carry her off on the road; but the fear of going against the king’s command kept them back. The one who showed himself most moved was Don Pedro Gregorio, the rich young heir thou knowest of, and they say he was deep in love with her; and since she left he has not been seen in our village again, and we all suspect he has gone after her to steal her away, but so far nothing has been heard of it.” “I always had a suspicion that gentleman had a passion for my daughter,” said Ricote; “but as I felt sure of my Ricota’s virtue it gave me no uneasiness to know that he loved her; for thou must have heard it said, Sancho, that the Morisco women seldom or never engage in amours with the old Christians; and my daughter, who I fancy thought more of being a Christian than of lovemaking, would not trouble herself about the attentions of this heir.” “God grant it,” said Sancho, “for it would be a bad business for both of them; but now let me be off, friend Ricote, for I want to reach where my master Don Quixote is to-night.” “God be with thee, brother Sancho,” said Ricote; “my comrades are beginning to stir, and it is time, too, for us to continue our journey;” and then they both embraced, and Sancho mounted Dapple, and Ricote leant upon his staff, and so they parted. 公爵和公爵夫人决定让唐吉诃德同他们的臣民进行决斗，其起因前面已经提到过了。那个小伙子不愿意同唐娜罗德里格斯的女儿结婚，已经跑到佛兰德去了。于是公爵和公爵夫人商定，让他们的一个仆人顶替那个小伙子。仆人是加斯科尼人，名叫托西洛斯。公爵和公爵夫人详细地告诉他应该如何如何做。两天之后，公爵告诉唐吉诃德，那个小伙子坚持说，若说他答应过同那个姑娘结婚，那就是姑娘睁着眼睛说谎话，而且是弥天大谎，所以，他准备四天之后以武装骑士的身份前来决斗。唐吉诃德听到这个消息后十分高兴，自信这回可以大显身手了。他把这次决斗当成向公爵和公爵夫人显示其勇敢臂膀的力量之天赐良机，焦急而又兴奋地等了四天，就好像过了四个世纪似的。 咱们暂且把唐吉诃德放在一边，去看看桑乔吧。桑乔悲喜交加地骑着他的驴赶路，来找他的主人，觉得能同唐吉诃德在一起比当岛屿总督还让他高兴。 桑乔走出他当总督的那个岛屿不远（其实桑乔从来没搞清，他当总督的那个地方到底是岛屿还是城市、乡镇或其他什么地方），看见迎面走来六个拿着长拐杖的朝圣者，也就是那种唱着歌乞讨的外国人。那几个人走到桑乔面前，一字排开，提高了嗓门，用他们自己的语言唱起了歌。桑乔听不懂，只有一个词他能理解，那就是“施舍”，于是他明白了，那几个人只不过是想要施舍。就像锡德·哈迈德说的，桑乔是个非常慈善的人，从褡裢里拿出了半块面包和半块奶酪递给他们，并且比划着告诉他们，自己没有其他东西可给了。那几个人高兴地接过东西说道： “盖尔特①！盖尔特！” ①盖尔特是德语单词“钱”的译音。 “几位好人，”桑乔说，“我不明白你们要什么东西。” 其中一个人从怀里掏出一个口袋让桑乔看，桑乔这才明白他们要的是钱。桑乔用大拇指顶着自己的喉咙，摊开两手，意思是说他没有一文钱，然后便催驴冲了过去。就在他冲过去的一刹那，那几个人当中的一位仔细看了他一下，立刻扑过来双手抱住他的腰，用非常地道的西班牙语高声喊道：“上帝保佑！我看见谁了？我抱住的不就是我尊贵的朋友，我的好邻居桑乔·潘萨吗？对，肯定是他，我现在既不是在做梦，也没有喝醉。” 桑乔听到有人喊他的名字，还抱住他的腰，十分惊奇。他一句话也没说，仔细地看了那人一会儿，仍然没有认出他是谁。那个人见桑乔还在发愣，便对他说道： “桑乔兄弟，你怎么连你的邻居，摩尔人店主里科特都认不出来了？” 桑乔再仔细看看，才慢慢认出确实是那个人。桑乔骑在驴上，抱着那人的脖子说： “你穿这身小丑的打扮，里科特，哪个鬼能认出你呀！告诉我，谁把你变成外国佬了？你怎么还敢回到西班牙来？假如有人遇到你，认出你，你可就麻烦了。” “只要你不说出去，桑乔，”那个朝圣人说，“就冲这身打扮，我敢肯定没有谁能认出我来。咱们离开大路，到那片杨树林那儿去吧。我的几个同伴想在那儿吃点东西，休息一会儿。你也同他们一起吃，他们都是老实人。我可以给你讲讲我遵照皇上的谕旨①离开咱们村以后遇到的事情。那个法令可把我们这些倒霉的人害苦了，这你想必听说过。” ①西班牙历史上曾多次颁布法令，驱逐摩尔人出境。 桑乔同意了，里科特招呼同伴向离大路很远的那片杨树林走去。那几个人扔掉长拐杖，脱去披肩，原来除了里科特已经上了年纪之外，他们都是些很精神的小伙子。他们都带着褡裢。而且看上去都装着不少令人垂涎欲滴的东西。他们躺到地上，以青草为台布，摆上面包、刀叉、核桃、奶酪片，还有几根大骨头，虽然没什么肉可啃，却还可以吮一吮。还有一种黑色食物，据说叫鱼子酱，是用鱼子做的，很适合下酒。油橄榄也不少，尽管都已经干瘪，没腌过，但可以含着吃，味道也不错。不过，在这些食物里最引人注目的还是六个小酒囊，他们每人都在褡裢里带了一个。那个里科特也带了一个，他现在已从摩尔人变成德国人了。他把酒囊拿了出来，大小也和另外五个酒囊差不多。 他们开始极有兴致但又极从容地喝酒，仔细地品味着每一口酒；吃的东西也都是一点儿一点儿地用刀尖挑着吃。吃到一定时候，大家一齐抬起胳膊，举起酒囊，嘴对着酒囊口，眼睛看着天，仿佛在向天空瞄准，然后才左右摇着头，做出非常快意的样子，过了好一会儿才把酒囊里的酒喝到肚子里去。桑乔把这一切都看在眼里，可他并不感到难过，相反，他就像那句俗语常说的那样，来了个入乡随俗，向里科特要过酒囊，也像其他人一样瞄向天空，然后津津有味地把酒喝下去。 酒囊一共举了四次，要举第五次已经不可能了，酒囊里已经空空如也，令大家很扫兴。不过，他们还是不时地用自己的右手去握桑乔的手，嘴里还说着“西班牙人德国人，都是一家人，都是好兄弟”。桑乔也回答：“我向上帝发誓，都是好兄弟！”桑乔这样嘻嘻哈哈地笑了一个小时，把他当总督遇到的那些事情都忘得一干二净。人们在吃喝的时候一般都很少考虑事情。喝完酒后，困意又开始袭扰大家，大家就在他们刚才还当桌子和台布用的草地上睡着了。里科特和桑乔吃喝得比较少，所以还清醒。里科特拉着桑乔，来到一棵山毛榉树旁边坐下，让那几个人甜蜜地睡去。里科特讲摩尔人的语言当然没问题，可是他却用地地道道的西班牙语向桑乔说道： “我的邻居和朋友桑乔，你很清楚，陛下颁布的那个驱逐我们的谕旨可把我们吓坏了，至少把我吓得够呛。还没到限定我们离开西班牙的时间，我和我的孩子们就已经受到严厉的惩治了。我觉得还是应该先安顿好再搬走，所有被限定时间离开他们居住的家园而搬到另一个地方去的人都是这么认为的。所以，我决定先一个人出去找好住的地方，然后再回来同家人一起搬出去。我清楚地看到，我们那儿的所有老人都看得很清楚，皇上的谕旨并不像有些人说的那样只是随便说说而已，而是不折不扣的法令，到了时间就一定会执行。我必须承认这个现实。我知道我们有些人曾有过恶毒的企图，皇上受了神灵的启示才作出这个英明的决定。可这并不是我们所有人都有罪，我们中间也有一些虚诚的基督徒。不过这种人毕竟是少数，大部分人与此相反，因而不能把敌人留在家里，把蛇留在怀里当然不行。 “反正我们遭驱逐是理所当然，罪有应得。有的人觉得驱逐我们还算轻的，可是对于我们来说，这已经是最严厉的惩罚了。我们无论到了什么地方，都因思念西班牙而哭泣，毕竟我们出生在西班牙，那里是我们的故乡。我们到处流浪，始终没有找到一个合适的地方。我们本来指望在柏培拉，在非洲的某个地方受到款待，可是偏偏那里的人最虐待我们。我们真是‘有福不懂享，失掉后方知’。我们都非常想回到西班牙来，其中很多人像我一样会讲西班牙语，他们已经回到了西班牙，而把老婆孩子留在外面无依无靠，他们太爱西班牙了。现在我才理解了人们常说的‘乡情最甜’的意思。我离开咱们村，去了法国。虽然我们在那儿受到了很好的招待，我还是想到处看看。我又经过意大利去了德国。我觉得在那儿生活得更自在些，那儿的居民不怎么小心眼儿，每个人都按照自己的意志生活，他们大部分人在思想上没有什么约束。 “我在奥古斯塔①附近找到了一所房子，并且在那儿遇到了这几个外国人。他们很多人都习惯了每年来一次西班牙，看看西班牙的教堂。他们把西班牙当成了他们的安乐园，每次都肯定能赚到不少钱，而且收入颇丰。他们几乎走遍了整个西班牙，而且每到一个地方，都是酒足饭饱，离开的时候手里至少有一个雷阿尔。等到走完西班牙，每个人都有一百多个杜卡多。他们把杜卡多换成金子，或者藏在长拐杖的筒里，或者藏在披肩的补丁里，或者用其他办法，把钱带出西班牙，送回他们国家去，尽管路上有层层关卡检查他们。桑乔，现在我想把我当初埋藏的财宝取出来。财宝埋在村外，所以去取不会有什么危险。我想写信或者取道瓦伦西亚去找我女儿和我老婆，我知道她们正在阿尔及尔。我正筹划如何把她们带到法国的某个港口，然后再把她们带到德国去，再往后就听天由命了。桑乔，我的确知道我女儿和我老婆是真正的基督徒。我虽然比不上她们，但也应该算基督徒而不是摩尔人了。我总是祈求上帝睁开眼睛，并且告诉我应该如何敬奉他。最让我感到意外的就是我不知道，我老婆和女儿为什么选择了柏培拉而没有去法国。她们是基督徒，完全可以在法国生活。” ①奥古斯塔即现在德国的奥格斯堡。 桑乔答道： “你看，里科特，这件事大概由不得你，她们是由你老婆的兄弟胡安·蒂奥彼索带走的。他是个地道的摩尔人，当然要到最合适他的地方去。还有一件事我要告诉你，就是我估计你去找你埋藏的那些东西恐怕是徒劳。我们听说，你老婆和她兄弟带的很多珠宝和金钱都被检查出来没收了。” “被没收了倒有可能，”里科特说，“不过桑乔，我知道我埋藏的那些东西他们没动，因为我怕出意外，没有告诉他们东西埋在哪儿了。桑乔，你如果愿意同我一起去，把埋的那些东西挖出来收好，我给你二百个盾。你可以添补些东西，我知道你现在很缺钱。” “我即使陪你去，”桑乔说，“也决不为贪钱。如果我贪钱，凭我今天早晨放弃的一个官职，六个月前我就可以用金砖砌墙，用银盘吃饭了。我觉得同你一起去就等于背叛了国王，帮助了他的敌人。别说你答应给我二百个盾，就是你现在给我四百个盾，我也不去。” “你放弃的是什么官职，桑乔？”里科特问。 “我放弃的官职是海岛的总督，”桑乔说，“说实在的，要想再找到那样的官职可就不容易了。” “那个岛屿在什么地方？”里科特问。 “在哪儿？”桑乔说，“离这儿两西里地远，叫巴拉塔里亚岛。” “别说了，桑乔，”里科特说，“岛屿都在海里，陆地上根本就没有岛屿。” “怎么没有？”桑乔说，“我告诉你，里科特朋友，我今天早晨就是从那儿出来的。昨天，我还在那儿挺得意地当总督，干得蛮不错呢。不过，我觉得当总督有危险，所以不干了。” “那你当总督得到什么好处了？”里科特问。 “得到的好处就是，”桑乔说，“知道了我不适合当总督，只配管一群牲畜；还有，就是当这类总督赚钱要以牺牲休息和睡眠甚至放弃吃饭为代价。因为在岛上，总督得吃得少，特别是在身边有保健医生的时候。” “我不明白你说的是什么，”里科特说，“我觉得你讲的这些全是胡说八道。谁会把岛屿交给你，让你做总督呀？世界上难道就没人比你更有当总督的才干？别说了，桑乔，你还是先清醒清醒吧，看看你是不是愿意同我一起去，就像我刚才说的，帮我把埋在地下的财宝挖出来。说实话，那东西真不少，可以称得上是财宝了。我也说过了，我一定会给你报酬。” “我已经对你说过了，里科特，”桑乔说，“我不想去。不过你放心，我不会告发你。你我趁早各赶各的路。我知道，好来的钱易丢，不好来的钱连钱带人一起完。” “我也不想勉强你，桑乔，”里科特说，“不过你告诉我，我女儿、老婆和她兄弟离开时，你在村子里吗？” “是的，我在。”桑乔说，“我还可以告诉你，你女儿离开的时候打扮得很漂亮，村里所有的人都出来看，大家都说你女儿是世界上最漂亮的人。她边走边哭，同她的女伴和相识的人拥抱。她请求所有前来看她的人祈求上帝和圣母保佑她。她说得那么伤心，连我这个不怎么爱哭的人都掉泪了。肯定有很多人想把她藏起来，或者在半路把她截回来，可是又怕违抗了国王的命令，只好罢休。最伤心的就是唐佩德罗·格雷戈里奥，就是你知道的那个很有钱的少爷，听说他非常喜欢你女儿。你女儿走后，他再也没有在村里露过面。大家都猜想他也跟着走了，想把你女儿抢回来。不过，到现在还没有听到任何消息。” “我原来一直怀疑那个小伙子爱着我女儿。”里科特说，“不过我相信我的里科塔的品行，因此虽然知道他爱着我女儿，我并不担心。你也一定听说过，桑乔，很少有或者根本没有摩尔姑娘同笃信基督教的男子通婚的。我相信我女儿主要是因为她信奉基督教，而不是多情，所以她不会理睬那个殷勤的少爷。” “但愿如此，”桑乔说，“否则双方都不好办。我该走了，里科特朋友，我想今天晚上赶到我主人唐吉诃德那儿去。” “愿上帝保佑你，桑乔兄弟。我的伙伴们也快醒了，我们也得接着赶路了。” 两人相互拥抱，桑乔骑上驴，里科特拿起长拐杖，彼此分手。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4675.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
