{"id":42257,"no":117,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 63","content":"Profound were Don Quixote’s reflections on the reply of the enchanted head, not one of them, however, hitting on the secret of the trick, but all concentrated on the promise, which he regarded as a certainty, of Dulcinea’s disenchantment. This he turned over in his mind again and again with great satisfaction, fully persuaded that he would shortly see its fulfillment; and as for Sancho, though, as has been said, he hated being a governor, still he had a longing to be giving orders and finding himself obeyed once more; this is the misfortune that being in authority, even in jest, brings with it. To resume; that afternoon their host Don Antonio Moreno and his two friends, with Don Quixote and Sancho, went to the galleys. The commandant had been already made aware of his good fortune in seeing two such famous persons as Don Quixote and Sancho, and the instant they came to the shore all the galleys struck their awnings and the clarions rang out. A skiff covered with rich carpets and cushions of crimson velvet was immediately lowered into the water, and as Don Quixote stepped on board of it, the leading galley fired her gangway gun, and the other galleys did the same; and as he mounted the starboard ladder the whole crew saluted him (as is the custom when a personage of distinction comes on board a galley) by exclaiming “Hu, hu, hu,” three times. The general, for so we shall call him, a Valencian gentleman of rank, gave him his hand and embraced him, saying, “I shall mark this day with a white stone as one of the happiest I can expect to enjoy in my lifetime, since I have seen Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, pattern and image wherein we see contained and condensed all that is worthy in knight-errantry.” Don Quixote delighted beyond measure with such a lordly reception, replied to him in words no less courteous. All then proceeded to the poop, which was very handsomely decorated, and seated themselves on the bulwark benches; the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped all hands to strip, which they did in an instant. Sancho, seeing such a number of men stripped to the skin, was taken aback, and still more when he saw them spread the awning so briskly that it seemed to him as if all the devils were at work at it; but all this was cakes and fancy bread to what I am going to tell now. Sancho was seated on the captain’s stage, close to the aftermost rower on the right-hand side. He, previously instructed in what he was to do, laid hold of Sancho, hoisting him up in his arms, and the whole crew, who were standing ready, beginning on the right, proceeded to pass him on, whirling him along from hand to hand and from bench to bench with such rapidity that it took the sight out of poor Sancho’s eyes, and he made quite sure that the devils themselves were flying away with him; nor did they leave off with him until they had sent him back along the left side and deposited him on the poop; and the poor fellow was left bruised and breathless and all in a sweat, and unable to comprehend what it was that had happened to him. Don Quixote when he saw Sancho’s flight without wings asked the general if this was a usual ceremony with those who came on board the galleys for the first time; for, if so, as he had no intention of adopting them as a profession, he had no mind to perform such feats of agility, and if anyone offered to lay hold of him to whirl him about, he vowed to God he would kick his soul out; and as he said this he stood up and clapped his hand upon his sword. At this instant they struck the awning and lowered the yard with a prodigious rattle. Sancho thought heaven was coming off its hinges and going to fall on his head, and full of terror he ducked it and buried it between his knees; nor were Don Quixote’s knees altogether under control, for he too shook a little, squeezed his shoulders together and lost colour. The crew then hoisted the yard with the same rapidity and clatter as when they lowered it, all the while keeping silence as though they had neither voice nor breath. The boatswain gave the signal to weigh anchor, and leaping upon the middle of the gangway began to lay on to the shoulders of the crew with his courbash or whip, and to haul out gradually to sea. When Sancho saw so many red feet (for such he took the oars to be) moving all together, he said to himself, “It’s these that are the real chanted things, and not the ones my master talks of. What can those wretches have done to be so whipped; and how does that one man who goes along there whistling dare to whip so many? I declare this is hell, or at least purgatory!” Don Quixote, observing how attentively Sancho regarded what was going on, said to him, “Ah, Sancho my friend, how quickly and cheaply might you finish off the disenchantment of Dulcinea, if you would strip to the waist and take your place among those gentlemen! Amid the pain and sufferings of so many you would not feel your own much; and moreover perhaps the sage Merlin would allow each of these lashes, being laid on with a good hand, to count for ten of those which you must give yourself at last.” The general was about to ask what these lashes were, and what was Dulcinea’s disenchantment, when a sailor exclaimed, “Monjui signals that there is an oared vessel off the coast to the west.” On hearing this the general sprang upon the gangway crying, “Now then, my sons, don’t let her give us the slip! It must be some Algerine corsair brigantine that the watchtower signals to us.” The three others immediately came alongside the chief galley to receive their orders. The general ordered two to put out to sea while he with the other kept in shore, so that in this way the vessel could not escape them. The crews plied the oars driving the galleys so furiously that they seemed to fly. The two that had put out to sea, after a couple of miles sighted a vessel which, so far as they could make out, they judged to be one of fourteen or fifteen banks, and so she proved. As soon as the vessel discovered the galleys she went about with the object and in the hope of making her escape by her speed; but the attempt failed, for the chief galley was one of the fastest vessels afloat, and overhauled her so rapidly that they on board the brigantine saw clearly there was no possibility of escaping, and the rais therefore would have had them drop their oars and give themselves up so as not to provoke the captain in command of our galleys to anger. But chance, directing things otherwise, so ordered it that just as the chief galley came close enough for those on board the vessel to hear the shouts from her calling on them to surrender, two Toraquis, that is to say two Turks, both drunken, that with a dozen more were on board the brigantine, discharged their muskets, killing two of the soldiers that lined the sides of our vessel. Seeing this the general swore he would not leave one of those he found on board the vessel alive, but as he bore down furiously upon her she slipped away from him underneath the oars. The galley shot a good way ahead; those on board the vessel saw their case was desperate, and while the galley was coming about they made sail, and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off; but their activity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm, for the galley coming up with them in a little more than half a mile threw her oars over them and took the whole of them alive. The other two galleys now joined company and all four returned with the prize to the beach, where a vast multitude stood waiting for them, eager to see what they brought back. The general anchored close in, and perceived that the viceroy of the city was on the shore. He ordered the skiff to push off to fetch him, and the yard to be lowered for the purpose of hanging forthwith the rais and the rest of the men taken on board the vessel, about six-and-thirty in number, all smart fellows and most of them Turkish musketeers. He asked which was the rais of the brigantine, and was answered in Spanish by one of the prisoners (who afterwards proved to he a Spanish renegade), “This young man, senor that you see here is our rais,” and he pointed to one of the handsomest and most gallant-looking youths that could be imagined. He did not seem to be twenty years of age. “Tell me, dog,” said the general, “what led thee to kill my soldiers, when thou sawest it was impossible for thee to escape? Is that the way to behave to chief galleys? Knowest thou not that rashness is not valour? Faint prospects of success should make men bold, but not rash.” The rais was about to reply, but the general could not at that moment listen to him, as he had to hasten to receive the viceroy, who was now coming on board the galley, and with him certain of his attendants and some of the people. “You have had a good chase, senor general,” said the viceroy. “Your excellency shall soon see how good, by the game strung up to this yard,” replied the general. “How so?” returned the viceroy. “Because,” said the general, “against all law, reason, and usages of war they have killed on my hands two of the best soldiers on board these galleys, and I have sworn to hang every man that I have taken, but above all this youth who is the rais of the brigantine,” and he pointed to him as he stood with his hands already bound and the rope round his neck, ready for death. The viceroy looked at him, and seeing him so well-favoured, so graceful, and so submissive, he felt a desire to spare his life, the comeliness of the youth furnishing him at once with a letter of recommendation. He therefore questioned him, saying, “Tell me, rais, art thou Turk, Moor, or renegade?” To which the youth replied, also in Spanish, “I am neither Turk, nor Moor, nor renegade.” “What art thou, then?” said the viceroy. “A Christian woman,” replied the youth. “A woman and a Christian, in such a dress and in such circumstances! It is more marvellous than credible,” said the viceroy. “Suspend the execution of the sentence,” said the youth; “your vengeance will not lose much by waiting while I tell you the story of my life.” What heart could be so hard as not to he softened by these words, at any rate so far as to listen to what the unhappy youth had to say? The general bade him say what he pleased, but not to expect pardon for his flagrant offence. With this permission the youth began in these words. “Born of Morisco parents, I am of that nation, more unhappy than wise, upon which of late a sea of woes has poured down. In the course of our misfortune I was carried to Barbary by two uncles of mine, for it was in vain that I declared I was a Christian, as in fact I am, and not a mere pretended one, or outwardly, but a true Catholic Christian. It availed me nothing with those charged with our sad expatriation to protest this, nor would my uncles believe it; on the contrary, they treated it as an untruth and a subterfuge set up to enable me to remain behind in the land of my birth; and so, more by force than of my own will, they took me with them. I had a Christian mother, and a father who was a man of sound sense and a Christian too; I imbibed the Catholic faith with my mother’s milk, I was well brought up, and neither in word nor in deed did I, I think, show any sign of being a Morisco. To accompany these virtues, for such I hold them, my beauty, if I possess any, grew with my growth; and great as was the seclusion in which I lived it was not so great but that a young gentleman, Don Gaspar Gregorio by name, eldest son of a gentleman who is lord of a village near ours, contrived to find opportunities of seeing me. How he saw me, how we met, how his heart was lost to me, and mine not kept from him, would take too long to tell, especially at a moment when I am in dread of the cruel cord that threatens me interposing between tongue and throat; I will only say, therefore, that Don Gregorio chose to accompany me in our banishment. He joined company with the Moriscoes who were going forth from other villages, for he knew their language very well, and on the voyage he struck up a friendship with my two uncles who were carrying me with them; for my father, like a wise and far-sighted man, as soon as he heard the first edict for our expulsion, quitted the village and departed in quest of some refuge for us abroad. He left hidden and buried, at a spot of which I alone have knowledge, a large quantity of pearls and precious stones of great value, together with a sum of money in gold cruzadoes and doubloons. He charged me on no account to touch the treasure, if by any chance they expelled us before his return. I obeyed him, and with my uncles, as I have said, and others of our kindred and neighbours, passed over to Barbary, and the place where we took up our abode was Algiers, much the same as if we had taken it up in hell itself. The king heard of my beauty, and report told him of my wealth, which was in some degree fortunate for me. He summoned me before him, and asked me what part of Spain I came from, and what money and jewels I had. I mentioned the place, and told him the jewels and money were buried there; but that they might easily be recovered if I myself went back for them. All this I told him, in dread lest my beauty and not his own covetousness should influence him. While he was engaged in conversation with me, they brought him word that in company with me was one of the handsomest and most graceful youths that could be imagined. I knew at once that they were speaking of Don Gaspar Gregorio, whose comeliness surpasses the most highly vaunted beauty. I was troubled when I thought of the danger he was in, for among those barbarous Turks a fair youth is more esteemed than a woman, be she ever so beautiful. The king immediately ordered him to be brought before him that he might see him, and asked me if what they said about the youth was true. I then, almost as if inspired by heaven, told him it was, but that I would have him to know it was not a man, but a woman like myself, and I entreated him to allow me to go and dress her in the attire proper to her, so that her beauty might be seen to perfection, and that she might present herself before him with less embarrassment. He bade me go by all means, and said that the next day we should discuss the plan to be adopted for my return to Spain to carry away the hidden treasure. I saw Don Gaspar, I told him the danger he was in if he let it be seen he was a man, I dressed him as a Moorish woman, and that same afternoon I brought him before the king, who was charmed when he saw him, and resolved to keep the damsel and make a present of her to the Grand Signor; and to avoid the risk she might run among the women of his seraglio, and distrustful of himself, he commanded her to be placed in the house of some Moorish ladies of rank who would protect and attend to her; and thither he was taken at once. What we both suffered (for I cannot deny that I love him) may be left to the imagination of those who are separated if they love one an. other dearly. The king then arranged that I should return to Spain in this brigantine, and that two Turks, those who killed your soldiers, should accompany me. There also came with me this Spanish renegade” — and here she pointed to him who had first spoken — “whom I know to be secretly a Christian, and to be more desirous of being left in Spain than of returning to Barbary. The rest of the crew of the brigantine are Moors and Turks, who merely serve as rowers. The two Turks, greedy and insolent, instead of obeying the orders we had to land me and this renegade in Christian dress (with which we came provided) on the first Spanish ground we came to, chose to run along the coast and make some prize if they could, fearing that if they put us ashore first, we might, in case of some accident befalling us, make it known that the brigantine was at sea, and thus, if there happened to be any galleys on the coast, they might be taken. We sighted this shore last night, and knowing nothing of these galleys, we were discovered, and the result was what you have seen. To sum up, there is Don Gregorio in woman’s dress, among women, in imminent danger of his life; and here am I, with hands bound, in expectation, or rather in dread, of losing my life, of which I am already weary. Here, sirs, ends my sad story, as true as it is unhappy; all I ask of you is to allow me to die like a Christian, for, as I have already said, I am not to be charged with the offence of which those of my nation are guilty;” and she stood silent, her eyes filled with moving tears, accompanied by plenty from the bystanders. The viceroy, touched with compassion, went up to her without speaking and untied the cord that bound the hands of the Moorish girl. But all the while the Morisco Christian was telling her strange story, an elderly pilgrim, who had come on board of the galley at the same time as the viceroy, kept his eyes fixed upon her; and the instant she ceased speaking he threw himself at her feet, and embracing them said in a voice broken by sobs and sighs, “O Ana Felix, my unhappy daughter, I am thy father Ricote, come back to look for thee, unable to live without thee, my soul that thou art!” At these words of his, Sancho opened his eyes and raised his head, which he had been holding down, brooding over his unlucky excursion; and looking at the pilgrim he recognised in him that same Ricote he met the day he quitted his government, and felt satisfied that this was his daughter. She being now unbound embraced her father, mingling her tears with his, while he addressing the general and the viceroy said, “This, sirs, is my daughter, more unhappy in her adventures than in her name. She is Ana Felix, surnamed Ricote, celebrated as much for her own beauty as for my wealth. I quitted my native land in search of some shelter or refuge for us abroad, and having found one in Germany I returned in this pilgrim’s dress, in the company of some other German pilgrims, to seek my daughter and take up a large quantity of treasure I had left buried. My daughter I did not find, the treasure I found and have with me; and now, in this strange roundabout way you have seen, I find the treasure that more than all makes me rich, my beloved daughter. If our innocence and her tears and mine can with strict justice open the door to clemency, extend it to us, for we never had any intention of injuring you, nor do we sympathise with the aims of our people, who have been justly banished.” “I know Ricote well,” said Sancho at this, “and I know too that what he says about Ana Felix being his daughter is true; but as to those other particulars about going and coming, and having good or bad intentions, I say nothing.” While all present stood amazed at this strange occurrence the general said, “At any rate your tears will not allow me to keep my oath; live, fair Ana Felix, all the years that heaven has allotted you; but these rash insolent fellows must pay the penalty of the crime they have committed;” and with that he gave orders to have the two Turks who had killed his two soldiers hanged at once at the yard-arm. The viceroy, however, begged him earnestly not to hang them, as their behaviour savoured rather of madness than of bravado. The general yielded to the viceroy’s request, for revenge is not easily taken in cold blood. They then tried to devise some scheme for rescuing Don Gaspar Gregorio from the danger in which he had been left. Ricote offered for that object more than two thousand ducats that he had in pearls and gems; they proposed several plans, but none so good as that suggested by the renegade already mentioned, who offered to return to Algiers in a small vessel of about six banks, manned by Christian rowers, as he knew where, how, and when he could and should land, nor was he ignorant of the house in which Don Gaspar was staying. The general and the viceroy had some hesitation about placing confidence in the renegade and entrusting him with the Christians who were to row, but Ana Felix said she could answer for him, and her father offered to go and pay the ransom of the Christians if by any chance they should not be forthcoming. This, then, being agreed upon, the viceroy landed, and Don Antonio Moreno took the fair Morisco and her father home with him, the viceroy charging him to give them the best reception and welcome in his power, while on his own part he offered all that house contained for their entertainment; so great was the good-will and kindliness the beauty of Ana Felix had infused into his heart. 唐吉诃德仍在思索着通灵头像的那些答话，丝毫未意识到这里有什么诡诈，并且对那些有关杜尔西内亚能够摆脱魔法的话信以为真。他想来想去，觉得这个诺言很快就可以实现，心中暗自欢喜。桑乔虽然像刚才说的那样对当总督厌倦了，但还是盼着能重掌大权，发号施令。虽然当总督只不过是一场玩笑，他还是落了个愿意当官的毛病。 那天下午，安东尼奥和他的两个朋友陪同唐吉诃德和桑乔去船上参观。船队指挥官事先已得知他们要光临，指挥官也愿意见识一下这两个出名的人物。他们刚接近船队，几艘船就一齐降下船篷，拉响汽笛，并且很快地放下一只小船，船上铺着高级地毯，备有洋红色天鹅绒软垫。唐吉诃德刚刚踏上小船，指挥船就鸣炮致意，其他几艘船也跟着鸣炮响应。唐吉诃德登上右翼的舷梯，船上的所有人都按照欢迎贵宾的习惯，三呼“呜、呜、呜”以示致意。船队的将军，我们暂且称他为将军吧，是瓦伦西亚的一位贵族。他拥抱着唐吉诃德说道： “今天我见到了集游侠骑士各种美德于一身的曼查的唐吉诃德大人，这是我一生中最幸运的一天，我要把这一天定作白石日。” 唐吉诃德同样彬彬有礼地答谢。他见自己被当成了大人物，心里很高兴。船上所有人都集中到了船尾，船尾布置得很漂亮。大家一起坐在船尾的长凳上。水手长跑到甲板中央吹哨，示意水手们脱衣服①，水手们立刻都把衣服脱了。桑乔见转眼间这么多人都把衣服脱了，有点儿害怕，特别是见到水手们迅速升起了船篷，更害怕了，觉得这一切都仿佛是魔鬼们在那儿操作。不过，比起下面发生的事情来，这就是小事一桩了。桑乔坐在驶帆杆上，身旁是右舷领船手②。领船手事先已得到吩咐，心中有了数。现在他抓住桑乔，把桑乔举了起来。所有水手也都站了起来。他们开始沿着船右舷依次传递桑乔，边传边转动桑乔的身体。他们传递得非常快，桑乔头晕目眩，以为自己肯定完了。最后，桑乔又被传回到船尾。可怜的桑乔被传得浑身酸痛，气喘吁吁，一身冷汗，到末了也没弄清究竟发生了什么事情。 ①脱衣服是为了使大劲划船。 ②指挥水手划桨的人。 唐吉诃德见水手们传递桑乔，便问将军是否对所有初次登船的人都要这样做。如果是这样，他说自己并不想在船上待下去，因而不愿意接受这种操练，并且向上帝发誓说，如果谁想把他举起来依次传递，他一定会叫那个人小命归西天。 唐吉诃德说完便站起来，手握剑柄。 这时，船篷降了下来，随着一声巨响，桅杆也倒了。桑乔以为天塌了，就要砸到自己的脑袋上，吓得立刻蜷缩起身子，把脑袋夹到两条腿中间。唐吉诃德也并非处变不惊。他吓了一跳，耸起肩膀，脸上大惊失色。水手们立刻又把桅杆竖了起来。所有这一切都默不作声地进行，仿佛大家都不会出声似的。水手长又发出了起锚的信号，然后跳到甲板中间，挥鞭向水手们的背上抽去。船慢慢启动了。桑乔把船桨当成了船的脚。他见那么多红色的船脚一齐摆动，心中暗自说道： “这才是真正的魔法呢！我主人说的那些魔法根本算不了什么。这些不幸的人究竟犯了什么罪，竟这样抽打他们？而这个吹哨的家伙一个人怎么敢打那么多人呢？现在我明白了，这里是地狱，或者至少也是炼狱。” 唐吉诃德见桑乔正在认真观察所发生的一切，便对他说道： “桑乔，如果你愿意的话，现在就把上衣脱掉，站到他们中间去，那么，为解除杜尔西内亚的魔法挨鞭子就方便多了。有这么多人受苦受难，你也就会觉得自己受的苦没什么了不起，而且说不定梅尔林看见打得这么狠，会以一鞭当十鞭算呢。” 将军正要问鞭笞是怎么回事，为杜尔西内亚解脱魔法又是怎么回事，一个水手忽然报告说： “蒙特胡依奇发来信号说，沿西海岸有一条手划船。” 一听这话，将军跳到甲板中央，说道： “哎，孩子们，瞭望哨说的那条船大概是一条阿尔及尔的海盗船，可别让它跑了。” 另外三艘船也按照指挥船的吩咐马上跟了上来。将军吩咐其中两艘船开到海上去，自己这艘船和另外一艘船则沿海岸行驶，这样，那条手划船就跑不掉了。水手们加紧划桨，船如飞一般向前疾驶。到海上去的那两艘船在距离那条船大约两海里的地方发现了目标，并且看出是一条有十四五排坐板的手划船。事实确实如此。那条船发现了这只船队，企图逃跑，想靠自己船的灵巧脱身。可是事与愿违，这艘指挥船是当时海上最轻巧的船之一，它逐渐接近了那条船。船上的人已明显意识到他们肯定跑不掉了。为了不激怒指挥船上的人，手划船的船长想让船上的人放下船桨投降。然而，命运却另有安排。指挥船已经接近了那条船，船上的人已经可以听到让他们投降的喊声了，可是船上有十四个土耳其人，其中两个喝醉了酒，竟放了两枪，打死了指挥船船头过道上的两个士兵。 将军见状发誓要杀死手划船上的所有人。指挥船拼命向前驶去，却又冲过了手划船，让那条船从指挥船的船桨下躲过去了。指挥船冲过头很大一段距离。手划船见指挥船超过了自己，便趁指挥船掉头的机会升起了船帆，帆桨并用，再次企图逃跑。可是他们的办法没能奏效，反而因为冒险闯了祸，没跑出半海里就被指挥船追上了。指挥船往手划船上抛过去一排桨，然后把船上的人全部生擒了。这时，另外两艘船也赶了上来，四艘船一起带着俘获物返回海岸。岸上有无数人正翘首以待，想看看他们究竟带回了什么。将军命令在靠近海岸的地方抛锚。他发现城市的总督也在岸上的人群里。 将军吩咐放下小船把总督接上船，又下令放倒桅杆，准备把手划船的船长和其他人都绞死。那条船上一共有三十六个人，不少是年轻力壮的土耳其小伙子，其中大部分是枪手。将军问谁是船长，俘虏中有个人用西班牙语回答，原来他是个叛教的西班牙人。他说： “大人，这个小伙子就是我们船长。” 说着他指了指其中一个非常英俊的小伙子，看样子还不到二十岁。将军问他： “你说，你这个缺心眼儿的狗崽子，既然已经跑不掉了，你为什么还要杀死我的兵士？你就是这样对待指挥船的吗？你难道不知道，你的鲁莽算不上勇敢吗？渺茫的希望可以使人勇敢，但并不是让人鲁莽啊。” 手划船的船长要答话，但是将军已经来不及听了，他得去迎接总督。总督带着几个佣人和当地的几个居民上了船。 “干得好啊，将军大人。”总督说。 “太好了，”将军说，“您马上就可以看到，他们要被吊在桅杆上绞死了。” “为什么要绞死他们呢？”总督问。 “因为他违反了法律，违反了战争的常规，杀死了我们船上两名最优秀的兵士。我发誓要把抓到的所有人都绞死，特别是这个小伙子，他是这条船的船长。” 将军说着指了指那个小伙子。小伙子已经被捆绑住双手，脖子上套着绳索，正等着被处死。总督看了看他，见是个英俊潇洒、神态谦和的小伙子，不禁动了恻隐之心，想免他一死，便问道： “告诉我，船长，你是土耳其人、摩尔人还是叛教者？” “我不是土耳其人，不是摩尔人，也不是叛教者。” “那么你是什么人呢？”总督问。 “是个基督徒女人。”小伙子回答。 “你穿这身衣服，做这种事情，竟是基督徒，而且是女人？ 真难以置信，简直让人惊奇。” “诸位大人，”小伙子说，“请暂缓处死我吧，待我讲完我的身世，你们再向我报仇也不晚呢。” 即使心肠再硬的人听到这话能不动心？至少可以先听听这个伤心忧郁的人到底讲些什么。将军说，他可以随便讲，但休想最后逃脱惩罚。于是，小伙子开始讲起来： “我的父母都是摩尔人，我们这个民族不够明智，并且很不幸，尤其是最近，灾难更是不断地降临。在不幸的潮流中，我的两个舅舅根本不理睬我说我是基督徒，把我带到了柏培拉。其实我真是基督徒，而且不是装的，是真的基督徒。我曾把我的情况告诉了负责放逐我们的人，可是根本不起作用，连我舅舅都不愿意相信。相反，他们以为我是有说谎，是编造借口想赖在我出生的那块土地上，所以还是硬逼着把我带走了。我的母亲是基督徒，父亲很有本事，也信奉基督教。我从吃奶时就信奉基督教，信奉基督教的良好习俗，无论是语言方面还是其他方面，我都一点儿不像摩尔人。 “随着我的各种美德日益增长，我认为自己有不少美德，我的美貌也与日俱增，如果说我还算漂亮的话。虽然我规规矩矩，闭门不出，还是让一个叫加斯帕尔·格雷戈里奥的小伙子看见了，这个小伙子是与我们家相邻的一个绅士的长子。至于他如何看见了我，我们说了什么，他如何倾心于我，而我又对他很满意，说起来话就长了。也许我刚说到半截儿，我脖子上的绳索就勒过来了。所以，我只说格雷戈里奥愿意陪同我一起外逃。他的摩尔语讲得很好，便同其他地方的摩尔人混到了一起。路上，他同我的两个舅舅交上了朋友。我父亲既机灵又谨慎。他一听说要驱逐我们的法令，便离开家到国外去找能够安身的地方。父亲把很多贵重的珠宝、钱财和罗乌拉埋藏在一个地方，那个地方只有我一个人知道。父亲说，假如在他回来之前我们就被赶走了，我千万不要去动那些埋着的宝藏。我确实没有去动那些宝藏，随着两个舅舅和亲朋好友一起到了柏培拉。我们最终在阿尔及尔落了脚，从此就好像进了地狱。 “当地国王听说了我长得美，又听说我有一笔财富，就派人把我叫去，问我是西班牙什么地方的人，带了多少钱和珠宝。我把藏宝的地点和藏了什么东西都告诉了他，而且说，如果我亲自回去，就很容易找到。我知道他不仅贪图我的美貌，而且还贪图我的财产，才对他说了这些。我们正说着话，有人进来报告说，我们这一伙中还有个非常英俊的小伙子。后来我才知道他们说的是加斯帕尔·格雷戈里奥，他的美貌使所有人都大为逊色。一想到格雷戈里奥面临的危险，我就慌了。我听说，那些野蛮的土耳其人喜欢一个漂亮的男孩或小伙子往往胜过漂亮的女人，无论那女人是多么漂亮。国王吩咐把格雷戈里奥带来看看，又问我他是否像报告的人说的那么漂亮。我好像事先想好了似的，说他的确很漂亮，不过他不是男的，他同我一样是女人。我请求国王允许我去为他换上自己的衣服，让他充分显示出自己的美貌，也免得他来见国王时难为情。国王让我赶紧去，至于我如何回到西班牙去取那些宝藏，且留待以后再谈。我同加斯帕尔讲了他暴露出自己是男人会遇到危险，让他换上摩尔女人的衣服，当天下午就带他去见国王。国王见了他十分高兴，打算把他留下来作为礼物献给土耳其皇帝。国王怕后宫的女人害他，也怕自己把持不住，就吩咐把他送到几个摩尔贵夫人家里，把他看管好并服侍好。他马上就被送走了。 “我不能否认我爱他。我们两人都很难过，这时我们才体会到相爱之人离别的痛苦。国王后来安排我乘这条手划船返回西班牙，叫那两个杀死了你们士兵的土耳其人与我同行。另外，还有这个西班牙叛教者，”说着她指了指刚才最先说话的那个人，“我很清楚他暗里仍然信奉基督徒，指望留在西班牙而不再回到柏培拉。其他人都是摩尔人和土耳其人，只管划船。这两个贪婪卑鄙的土耳其人，国王吩咐他们给我和这个叛教者换上基督徒的衣服，在西班牙上岸，可他们不听国王吩咐，在沿岸地区游弋，如果可能就抢些财物。他们怕我们先上岸，万一遇到事，就会暴露他们在海上的船，要是岸边再有船，就会抓住他们。昨天晚上，我们发现了这个海滩，却不知道这儿还有四艘船。我们暴露了，而后来的事情你们都清楚。现在，格雷戈里奥正身着女装混在女人中间，随时都有生命危险。我双手被捆着，正在等死。确切地说，我怕死，可是我已经活够了。诸位大人，这就是我的伤心经历，既真实又不幸。我只请求你们让我作为一个基督徒去死。我已经说过，跟我同族的人犯的错误与我毫无关系。” 讲到这儿她不再说话，眼中噙满了泪水，其他在场的人也陪着落泪。总督非常同情她，一言不发地走到她身边，解开了捆着她那双纤纤素手的绳子。 当摩尔姑娘讲述她的颠沛流离的经历时，有一位朝圣老人的眼睛一直盯着她。那位老人是跟着总督上船的。摩尔姑娘刚讲完，他就扑倒在姑娘的脚下，抱着她的脚泣不成声地说道： “哎，安娜·费利克斯，我不幸的女儿哟！我是你父亲里科特。我回来就是找你的，没有你我活不下去呀，你是我的心肝！” 桑乔正低着头想他这次出游遇到的倒霉事。听到这话，他睁开眼睛抬起头，看着那个朝圣人，认出他就是自己离开总督职位那天遇到的里科特，而且也认出那个摩尔姑娘就是里科特的女儿。里科特的女儿现在已被松了绑，她抱着父亲，两人的眼泪流到了一起。里科特对将军和总督说； “两位大人，这就是我那个名字虽好听、身世却不幸的女儿。她叫安娜·费利克斯，又名里科塔。她由于美貌和财富而出了名。我离开了我的祖国，到国外去寻找能够安顿我们的地方。现在我已经在德国找好了地方，于是打扮成朝圣者，跟几个德国人一起回来寻找我女儿，想取出我埋藏的财宝。 “我没有找到女儿，却找到了财宝。现在我把财宝带来了，经过刚才这段曲折的奇遇，我又找到了我的无价之宝，也就是我女儿。如果我们的小小罪孽和她与我的眼泪能够引起你们的怜悯，就请你们可怜可怜我们吧。我们从未想冒犯你们，也从未想同我们那些被放逐的同胞一起做什么对不起你们的事情。” 桑乔这时说道： “我认识里科特，知道安娜·费利克斯确是他女儿。至于其他什么来来去去、好意歹意的烦事，我就管不着了。” 所有在场的人都被这故事惊呆了。将军说道： “你们的眼泪已经使我无论如何也不能再履行我的诺言了。美丽的安娜·费利克斯，活下去吧，老天会让你安享余生，而让那些犯下罪行的大胆无礼的家伙受罚。” 接着，将军命令绞死那两个杀害了兵士的土耳其人，然而总督却请求不要绞死这两个土耳其人，因为他们犯下罪恶主要是出于一种疯狂，而不是出于勇气。将军同意了总督的请求，不准备再进行残酷的报复了。接着，大家又策划如何把格雷戈里奥从危险中解救出来。里科特主动提出愿拿出价值两千杜卡多的珠宝。大家出了很多主意，可是哪个都不如那个西班牙叛教者的主意好。他自告奋勇要带领一条配有划船手的六对桨船返回阿尔及尔，他知道应该在何时何地如何营救加斯帕尔，而且他了解加斯帕尔所在的那间房子。将军和总督对叛教者表示怀疑，准备当划船手的西班牙人也不信任他。可是安娜·费利克斯信任他，她的父亲里科特也说，如果几个划船的西班牙人被俘，他愿意出钱去赎人。 商量好这个办法之后，总督下了船。安东尼奥·莫雷诺也带着摩尔姑娘和她父亲回到自己家，因为总督已委托他尽力照顾好这父女二人。安东尼奥本人也很愿意照顾好他们。安东尼奥的热情主要是出于对安娜·费利克斯的美貌颇有好感。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4684.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
