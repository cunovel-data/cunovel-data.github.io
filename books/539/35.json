{"id":42175,"no":35,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 34","content":"“It is commonly said that an army looks ill without its general and a castle without its castellan, and I say that a young married woman looks still worse without her husband unless there are very good reasons for it. I find myself so ill at ease without you, and so incapable of enduring this separation, that unless you return quickly I shall have to go for relief to my parents’ house, even if I leave yours without a protector; for the one you left me, if indeed he deserved that title, has, I think, more regard to his own pleasure than to what concerns you: as you are possessed of discernment I need say no more to you, nor indeed is it fitting I should say more.” Anselmo received this letter, and from it he gathered that Lothario had already begun his task and that Camilla must have replied to him as he would have wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he sent word to her not to leave his house on any account, as he would very shortly return. Camilla was astonished at Anselmo’s reply, which placed her in greater perplexity than before, for she neither dared to remain in her own house, nor yet to go to her parents’; for in remaining her virtue was imperilled, and in going she was opposing her husband’s commands. Finally she decided upon what was the worse course for her, to remain, resolving not to fly from the presence of Lothario, that she might not give food for gossip to her servants; and she now began to regret having written as she had to her husband, fearing he might imagine that Lothario had perceived in her some lightness which had impelled him to lay aside the respect he owed her; but confident of her rectitude she put her trust in God and in her own virtuous intentions, with which she hoped to resist in silence all the solicitations of Lothario, without saying anything to her husband so as not to involve him in any quarrel or trouble; and she even began to consider how to excuse Lothario to Anselmo when he should ask her what it was that induced her to write that letter. With these resolutions, more honourable than judicious or effectual, she remained the next day listening to Lothario, who pressed his suit so strenuously that Camilla’s firmness began to waver, and her virtue had enough to do to come to the rescue of her eyes and keep them from showing signs of a certain tender compassion which the tears and appeals of Lothario had awakened in her bosom. Lothario observed all this, and it inflamed him all the more. In short he felt that while Anselmo’s absence afforded time and opportunity he must press the siege of the fortress, and so he assailed her self-esteem with praises of her beauty, for there is nothing that more quickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fair women’s vanity than vanity itself upon the tongue of flattery. In fact with the utmost assiduity he undermined the rock of her purity with such engines that had Camilla been of brass she must have fallen. He wept, he entreated, he promised, he flattered, he importuned, he pretended with so much feeling and apparent sincerity, that he overthrew the virtuous resolves of Camilla and won the triumph he least expected and most longed for. Camilla yielded, Camilla fell; but what wonder if the friendship of Lothario could not stand firm? A clear proof to us that the passion of love is to be conquered only by flying from it, and that no one should engage in a struggle with an enemy so mighty; for divine strength is needed to overcome his human power. Leonela alone knew of her mistress’s weakness, for the two false friends and new lovers were unable to conceal it. Lothario did not care to tell Camilla the object Anselmo had in view, nor that he had afforded him the opportunity of attaining such a result, lest she should undervalue his love and think that it was by chance and without intending it and not of his own accord that he had made love to her. A few days later Anselmo returned to his house and did not perceive what it had lost, that which he so lightly treated and so highly prized. He went at once to see Lothario, and found him at home; they embraced each other, and Anselmo asked for the tidings of his life or his death. “The tidings I have to give thee, Anselmo my friend,” said Lothario, “are that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and crown of all good wives. The words that I have addressed to her were borne away on the wind, my promises have been despised, my presents have been refused, such feigned tears as I shed have been turned into open ridicule. In short, as Camilla is the essence of all beauty, so is she the treasure-house where purity dwells, and gentleness and modesty abide with all the virtues that can confer praise, honour, and happiness upon a woman. Take back thy money, my friend; here it is, and I have had no need to touch it, for the chastity of Camilla yields not to things so base as gifts or promises. Be content, Anselmo, and refrain from making further proof; and as thou hast passed dryshod through the sea of those doubts and suspicions that are and may be entertained of women, seek not to plunge again into the deep ocean of new embarrassments, or with another pilot make trial of the goodness and strength of the bark that Heaven has granted thee for thy passage across the sea of this world; but reckon thyself now safe in port, moor thyself with the anchor of sound reflection, and rest in peace until thou art called upon to pay that debt which no nobility on earth can escape paying.” Anselmo was completely satisfied by the words of Lothario, and believed them as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless he begged of him not to relinquish the undertaking, were it but for the sake of curiosity and amusement; though thenceforward he need not make use of the same earnest endeavours as before; all he wished him to do was to write some verses to her, praising her under the name of Chloris, for he himself would give her to understand that he was in love with a lady to whom he had given that name to enable him to sing her praises with the decorum due to her modesty; and if Lothario were unwilling to take the trouble of writing the verses he would compose them himself. “That will not be necessary,” said Lothario, “for the muses are not such enemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course of the year. Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a pretended amour of mine; as for the verses will make them, and if not as good as the subject deserves, they shall be at least the best I can produce.” An agreement to this effect was made between the friends, the ill-advised one and the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his house asked Camilla the question she already wondered he had not asked before — what it was that had caused her to write the letter she had sent him. Camilla replied that it had seemed to her that Lothario looked at her somewhat more freely than when he had been at home; but that now she was undeceived and believed it to have been only her own imagination, for Lothario now avoided seeing her, or being alone with her. Anselmo told her she might be quite easy on the score of that suspicion, for he knew that Lothario was in love with a damsel of rank in the city whom he celebrated under the name of Chloris, and that even if he were not, his fidelity and their great friendship left no room for fear. Had not Camilla, however, been informed beforehand by Lothario that this love for Chloris was a pretence, and that he himself had told Anselmo of it in order to be able sometimes to give utterance to the praises of Camilla herself, no doubt she would have fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy; but being forewarned she received the startling news without uneasiness. The next day as the three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario to recite something of what he had composed for his mistress Chloris; for as Camilla did not know her, he might safely say what he liked. “Even did she know her,” returned Lothario, “I would hide nothing, for when a lover praises his lady’s beauty, and charges her with cruelty, he casts no imputation upon her fair name; at any rate, all I can say is that yesterday I made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this Chloris, which goes thus: Of happier mortals balmy slumbers close, The weary tale of my unnumbered woes To Chloris and to Heaven is wont to rise. And when the light of day returning dyes The portals of the east with tints of rose, With undiminished force my sorrow flows In broken accents and in burning sighs. And when the sun ascends his star-girt throne, And on the earth pours down his midday beams, Noon but renews my wailing and my tears; And with the night again goes up my moan. Yet ever in my agony it seems To me that neither Heaven nor Chloris hears.” The sonnet pleased Camilla, and still more Anselmo, for he praised it and said the lady was excessively cruel who made no return for sincerity so manifest. On which Camilla said, “Then all that love-smitten poets say is true?” “As poets they do not tell the truth,” replied Lothario; “but as lovers they are not more defective in expression than they are truthful.” “There is no doubt of that,” observed Anselmo, anxious to support and uphold Lothario’s ideas with Camilla, who was as regardless of his design as she was deep in love with Lothario; and so taking delight in anything that was his, and knowing that his thoughts and writings had her for their object, and that she herself was the real Chloris, she asked him to repeat some other sonnet or verses if he recollected any. “I do,” replied Lothario, “but I do not think it as good as the first one, or, more correctly speaking, less bad; but you can easily judge, for it is this. As certain as that thou, ungrateful fair, Dead at thy feet shouldst see me lying, ere My heart repented of its love for thee. If buried in oblivion I should be, Bereft of life, fame, favour, even there It would be found that I thy image bear Deep graven in my breast for all to see. This like some holy relic do I prize To save me from the fate my truth entails, Truth that to thy hard heart its vigour owes. Alas for him that under lowering skies, In peril o’er a trackless ocean sails, Where neither friendly port nor pole-star shows.” Anselmo praised this second sonnet too, as he had praised the first; and so he went on adding link after link to the chain with which he was binding himself and making his dishonour secure; for when Lothario was doing most to dishonour him he told him he was most honoured; and thus each step that Camilla descended towards the depths of her abasement, she mounted, in his opinion, towards the summit of virtue and fair fame. It so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with her maid, Camilla said to her, “I am ashamed to think, my dear Leonela, how lightly I have valued myself that I did not compel Lothario to purchase by at least some expenditure of time that full possession of me that I so quickly yielded him of my own free will. I fear that he will think ill of my pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistible influence he brought to bear upon me.” “Let not that trouble you, my lady,” said Leonela, “for it does not take away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to give it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized; nay, they are wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice.” “They say also,” said Camilla, “that what costs little is valued less.” “That saying does not hold good in your case,” replied Leonela, “for love, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; with this one it runs, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others it burns; some it wounds, others it slays; it begins the course of its desires, and at the same moment completes and ends it; in the morning it will lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it, for there is no power that can resist it; so what are you in dread of, what do you fear, when the same must have befallen Lothario, love having chosen the absence of my lord as the instrument for subduing you? and it was absolutely necessary to complete then what love had resolved upon, without affording the time to let Anselmo return and by his presence compel the work to be left unfinished; for love has no better agent for carrying out his designs than opportunity; and of opportunity he avails himself in all his feats, especially at the outset. All this I know well myself, more by experience than by hearsay, and some day, senora, I will enlighten you on the subject, for I am of your flesh and blood too. Moreover, lady Camilla, you did not surrender yourself or yield so quickly but that first you saw Lothario’s whole soul in his eyes, in his sighs, in his words, his promises and his gifts, and by it and his good qualities perceived how worthy he was of your love. This, then, being the case, let not these scrupulous and prudish ideas trouble your imagination, but be assured that Lothario prizes you as you do him, and rest content and satisfied that as you are caught in the noose of love it is one of worth and merit that has taken you, and one that has not only the four S’s that they say true lovers ought to have, but a complete alphabet; only listen to me and you will see how I can repeat it by rote. He is to my eyes and thinking, Amiable, Brave, Courteous, Distinguished, Elegant, Fond, Gay, Honourable, Illustrious, Loyal, Manly, Noble, Open, Polite, Quickwitted, Rich, and the S’s according to the saying, and then Tender, Veracious: X does not suit him, for it is a rough letter; Y has been given already; and Z Zealous for your honour.” Camilla laughed at her maid’s alphabet, and perceived her to be more experienced in love affairs than she said, which she admitted, confessing to Camilla that she had love passages with a young man of good birth of the same city. Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lest it might prove the means of endangering her honour, and asked whether her intrigue had gone beyond words, and she with little shame and much effrontery said it had; for certain it is that ladies’ imprudences make servants shameless, who, when they see their mistresses make a false step, think nothing of going astray themselves, or of its being known. All that Camilla could do was to entreat Leonela to say nothing about her doings to him whom she called her lover, and to conduct her own affairs secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of Anselmo or of Lothario. Leonela said she would, but kept her word in such a way that she confirmed Camilla’s apprehension of losing her reputation through her means; for this abandoned and bold Leonela, as soon as she perceived that her mistress’s demeanour was not what it was wont to be, had the audacity to introduce her lover into the house, confident that even if her mistress saw him she would not dare to expose him; for the sins of mistresses entail this mischief among others; they make themselves the slaves of their own servants, and are obliged to hide their laxities and depravities; as was the case with Camilla, who though she perceived, not once but many times, that Leonela was with her lover in some room of the house, not only did not dare to chide her, but afforded her opportunities for concealing him and removed all difficulties, lest he should be seen by her husband. She was unable, however, to prevent him from being seen on one occasion, as he sallied forth at daybreak, by Lothario, who, not knowing who he was, at first took him for a spectre; but, as soon as he saw him hasten away, muffling his face with his cloak and concealing himself carefully and cautiously, he rejected this foolish idea, and adopted another, which would have been the ruin of all had not Camilla found a remedy. It did not occur to Lothario that this man he had seen issuing at such an untimely hour from Anselmo’s house could have entered it on Leonela’s account, nor did he even remember there was such a person as Leonela; all he thought was that as Camilla had been light and yielding with him, so she had been with another; for this further penalty the erring woman’s sin brings with it, that her honour is distrusted even by him to whose overtures and persuasions she has yielded; and he believes her to have surrendered more easily to others, and gives implicit credence to every suspicion that comes into his mind. All Lothario’s good sense seems to have failed him at this juncture; all his prudent maxims escaped his memory; for without once reflecting rationally, and without more ado, in his impatience and in the blindness of the jealous rage that gnawed his heart, and dying to revenge himself upon Camilla, who had done him no wrong, before Anselmo had risen he hastened to him and said to him, “Know, Anselmo, that for several days past I have been struggling with myself, striving to withhold from thee what it is no longer possible or right that I should conceal from thee. Know that Camilla’s fortress has surrendered and is ready to submit to my will; and if I have been slow to reveal this fact to thee, it was in order to see if it were some light caprice of hers, or if she sought to try me and ascertain if the love I began to make to her with thy permission was made with a serious intention. I thought, too, that she, if she were what she ought to be, and what we both believed her, would have ere this given thee information of my addresses; but seeing that she delays, I believe the truth of the promise she has given me that the next time thou art absent from the house she will grant me an interview in the closet where thy jewels are kept (and it was true that Camilla used to meet him there); but I do not wish thee to rush precipitately to take vengeance, for the sin is as yet only committed in intention, and Camilla’s may change perhaps between this and the appointed time, and repentance spring up in its place. As hitherto thou hast always followed my advice wholly or in part, follow and observe this that I will give thee now, so that, without mistake, and with mature deliberation, thou mayest satisfy thyself as to what may seem the best course; pretend to absent thyself for two or three days as thou hast been wont to do on other occasions, and contrive to hide thyself in the closet; for the tapestries and other things there afford great facilities for thy concealment, and then thou wilt see with thine own eyes and I with mine what Camilla’s purpose may be. And if it be a guilty one, which may be feared rather than expected, with silence, prudence, and discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument of punishment for the wrong done thee.” Anselmo was amazed, overwhelmed, and astounded at the words of Lothario, which came upon him at a time when he least expected to hear them, for he now looked upon Camilla as having triumphed over the pretended attacks of Lothario, and was beginning to enjoy the glory of her victory. He remained silent for a considerable time, looking on the ground with fixed gaze, and at length said, “Thou hast behaved, Lothario, as I expected of thy friendship: I will follow thy advice in everything; do as thou wilt, and keep this secret as thou seest it should be kept in circumstances so unlooked for.” Lothario gave him his word, but after leaving him he repented altogether of what he had said to him, perceiving how foolishly he had acted, as he might have revenged himself upon Camilla in some less cruel and degrading way. He cursed his want of sense, condemned his hasty resolution, and knew not what course to take to undo the mischief or find some ready escape from it. At last he decided upon revealing all to Camilla, and, as there was no want of opportunity for doing so, he found her alone the same day; but she, as soon as she had the chance of speaking to him, said, “Lothario my friend, I must tell thee I have a sorrow in my heart which fills it so that it seems ready to burst; and it will be a wonder if it does not; for the audacity of Leonela has now reached such a pitch that every night she conceals a gallant of hers in this house and remains with him till morning, at the expense of my reputation; inasmuch as it is open to anyone to question it who may see him quitting my house at such unseasonable hours; but what distresses me is that I cannot punish or chide her, for her privity to our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent about hers, while I am dreading that some catastrophe will come of it.” As Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some device to delude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out was Leonela’s lover and not hers; but when he saw how she wept and suffered, and begged him to help her, he became convinced of the truth, and the conviction completed his confusion and remorse; however, he told Camilla not to distress herself, as he would take measures to put a stop to the insolence of Leonela. At the same time he told her what, driven by the fierce rage of jealousy, he had said to Anselmo, and how he had arranged to hide himself in the closet that he might there see plainly how little she preserved her fidelity to him; and he entreated her pardon for this madness, and her advice as to how to repair it, and escape safely from the intricate labyrinth in which his imprudence had involved him. Camilla was struck with alarm at hearing what Lothario said, and with much anger, and great good sense, she reproved him and rebuked his base design and the foolish and mischievous resolution he had made; but as woman has by nature a nimbler wit than man for good and for evil, though it is apt to fail when she sets herself deliberately to reason, Camilla on the spur of the moment thought of a way to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable, and told Lothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo should conceal himself in the place he mentioned, for she hoped from his concealment to obtain the means of their enjoying themselves for the future without any apprehension; and without revealing her purpose to him entirely she charged him to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was concealed, to come to her when Leonela should call him, and to all she said to him to answer as he would have answered had he not known that Anselmo was listening. Lothario pressed her to explain her intention fully, so that he might with more certainty and precaution take care to do what he saw to be needful. “I tell you,” said Camilla, “there is nothing to take care of except to answer me what I shall ask you;” for she did not wish to explain to him beforehand what she meant to do, fearing lest he should be unwilling to follow out an idea which seemed to her such a good one, and should try or devise some other less practicable plan. Lothario then retired, and the next day Anselmo, under pretence of going to his friend’s country house, took his departure, and then returned to conceal himself, which he was able to do easily, as Camilla and Leonela took care to give him the opportunity; and so he placed himself in hiding in the state of agitation that it may be imagined he would feel who expected to see the vitals of his honour laid bare before his eyes, and found himself on the point of losing the supreme blessing he thought he possessed in his beloved Camilla. Having made sure of Anselmo’s being in his hiding-place, Camilla and Leonela entered the closet, and the instant she set foot within it Camilla said, with a deep sigh, “Ah! dear Leonela, would it not be better, before I do what I am unwilling you should know lest you should seek to prevent it, that you should take Anselmo’s dagger that I have asked of you and with it pierce this vile heart of mine? But no; there is no reason why I should suffer the punishment of another’s fault. I will first know what it is that the bold licentious eyes of Lothario have seen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me a design so base as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend and of my honour. Go to the window, Leonela, and call him, for no doubt he is in the street waiting to carry out his vile project; but mine, cruel it may be, but honourable, shall be carried out first.” “Ah, senora,” said the crafty Leonela, who knew her part, “what is it you want to do with this dagger? Can it be that you mean to take your own life, or Lothario’s ? for whichever you mean to do, it will lead to the loss of your reputation and good name. It is better to dissemble your wrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the house now and finding us alone; consider, senora, we are weak women and he is a man, and determined, and as he comes with such a base purpose, blind and urged by passion, perhaps before you can put yours into execution he may do what will be worse for you than taking your life. Ill betide my master, Anselmo, for giving such authority in his house to this shameless fellow! And supposing you kill him, senora, as I suspect you mean to do, what shall we do with him when he is dead?” “What, my friend?” replied Camilla, “we shall leave him for Anselmo to bury him; for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide his own infamy under ground. Summon him, make haste, for all the time I delay in taking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against the loyalty I owe my husband.” Anselmo was listening to all this, and every word that Camilla uttered made him change his mind; but when he heard that it was resolved to kill Lothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself to avert such a disaster; but in his anxiety to see the issue of a resolution so bold and virtuous he restrained himself, intending to come forth in time to prevent the deed. At this moment Camilla, throwing herself upon a bed that was close by, swooned away, and Leonela began to weep bitterly, exclaiming, “Woe is me! that I should be fated to have dying here in my arms the flower of virtue upon earth, the crown of true wives, the pattern of chastity!” with more to the same effect, so that anyone who heard her would have taken her for the most tender-hearted and faithful handmaid in the world, and her mistress for another persecuted Penelope. Camilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on coming to herself she said, “Why do you not go, Leonela, to call hither that friend, the falsest to his friend the sun ever shone upon or night concealed? Away, run, haste, speed! lest the fire of my wrath burn itself out with delay, and the righteous vengeance that I hope for melt away in menaces and maledictions.” “I am just going to call him, senora,” said Leonela; “but you must first give me that dagger, lest while I am gone you should by means of it give cause to all who love you to weep all their lives.” “Go in peace, dear Leonela, I will not do so,” said Camilla, “for rash and foolish as I may be, to your mind, in defending my honour, I am not going to be so much so as that Lucretia who they say killed herself without having done anything wrong, and without having first killed him on whom the guilt of her misfortune lay. I shall die, if I am to die; but it must be after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here to weep over audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to.” Leonela required much pressing before she would go to summon Lothario, but at last she went, and while awaiting her return Camilla continued, as if speaking to herself, “Good God! would it not have been more prudent to have repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before, than to allow him, as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile, even for the short time I must wait until I undeceive him? No doubt it would have been better; but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of my husband vindicated, should he find so clear and easy an escape from the strait into which his depravity has led him. Let the traitor pay with his life for the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the world know (if haply it shall ever come to know) that Camilla not only preserved her allegiance to her husband, but avenged him of the man who dared to wrong him. Still, I think it might be better to disclose this to Anselmo. But then I have called his attention to it in the letter I wrote to him in the country, and, if he did nothing to prevent the mischief I there pointed out to him, I suppose it was that from pure goodness of heart and trustfulness he would not and could not believe that any thought against his honour could harbour in the breast of so stanch a friend; nor indeed did I myself believe it for many days, nor should I have ever believed it if his insolence had not gone so far as to make it manifest by open presents, lavish promises, and ceaseless tears. But why do I argue thus? Does a bold determination stand in need of arguments? Surely not. Then traitors avaunt! Vengeance to my aid! Let the false one come, approach, advance, die, yield up his life, and then befall what may. Pure I came to him whom Heaven bestowed upon me, pure I shall leave him; and at the worst bathed in my own chaste blood and in the foul blood of the falsest friend that friendship ever saw in the world;” and as she uttered these words she paced the room holding the unsheathed dagger, with such irregular and disordered steps, and such gestures that one would have supposed her to have lost her senses, and taken her for some violent desperado instead of a delicate woman. Anselmo, hidden behind some tapestries where he had concealed himself, beheld and was amazed at all, and already felt that what he had seen and heard was a sufficient answer to even greater suspicions; and he would have been now well pleased if the proof afforded by Lothario’s coming were dispensed with, as he feared some sudden mishap; but as he was on the point of showing himself and coming forth to embrace and undeceive his wife he paused as he saw Leonela returning, leading Lothario. Camilla when she saw him, drawing a long line in front of her on the floor with the dagger, said to him, “Lothario, pay attention to what I say to thee: if by any chance thou darest to cross this line thou seest, or even approach it, the instant I see thee attempt it that same instant will I pierce my bosom with this dagger that I hold in my hand; and before thou answerest me a word desire thee to listen to a few from me, and afterwards thou shalt reply as may please thee. First, I desire thee to tell me, Lothario, if thou knowest my husband Anselmo, and in what light thou regardest him; and secondly I desire to know if thou knowest me too. Answer me this, without embarrassment or reflecting deeply what thou wilt answer, for they are no riddles I put to thee.” Lothario was not so dull but that from the first moment when Camilla directed him to make Anselmo hide himself he understood what she intended to do, and therefore he fell in with her idea so readily and promptly that between them they made the imposture look more true than truth; so he answered her thus: “I did not think, fair Camilla, that thou wert calling me to ask questions so remote from the object with which I come; but if it is to defer the promised reward thou art doing so, thou mightst have put it off still longer, for the longing for happiness gives the more distress the nearer comes the hope of gaining it; but lest thou shouldst say that I do not answer thy questions, I say that I know thy husband Anselmo, and that we have known each other from our earliest years; I will not speak of what thou too knowest, of our friendship, that I may not compel myself to testify against the wrong that love, the mighty excuse for greater errors, makes me inflict upon him. Thee I know and hold in the same estimation as he does, for were it not so I had not for a lesser prize acted in opposition to what I owe to my station and the holy laws of true friendship, now broken and violated by me through that powerful enemy, love.” “If thou dost confess that,” returned Camilla, “mortal enemy of all that rightly deserves to be loved, with what face dost thou dare to come before one whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he is reflected on whom thou shouldst look to see how unworthily thou him? But, woe is me, I now comprehend what has made thee give so little heed to what thou owest to thyself; it must have been some freedom of mine, for I will not call it immodesty, as it did not proceed from any deliberate intention, but from some heedlessness such as women are guilty of through inadvertence when they think they have no occasion for reserve. But tell me, traitor, when did I by word or sign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken in thee a shadow of hope of attaining thy base wishes? When were not thy professions of love sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked? When were thy frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted? But as I am persuaded that no one can long persevere in the attempt to win love unsustained by some hope, I am willing to attribute to myself the blame of thy assurance, for no doubt some thoughtlessness of mine has all this time fostered thy hopes; and therefore will I punish myself and inflict upon myself the penalty thy guilt deserves. And that thou mayest see that being so relentless to myself I cannot possibly be otherwise to thee, I have summoned thee to be a witness of the sacrifice I mean to offer to the injured honour of my honoured husband, wronged by thee with all the assiduity thou wert capable of, and by me too through want of caution in avoiding every occasion, if I have given any, of encouraging and sanctioning thy base designs. Once more I say the suspicion in my mind that some imprudence of mine has engendered these lawless thoughts in thee, is what causes me most distress and what I desire most to punish with my own hands, for were any other instrument of punishment employed my error might become perhaps more widely known; but before I do so, in my death I mean to inflict death, and take with me one that will fully satisfy my longing for the revenge I hope for and have; for I shall see, wheresoever it may be that I go, the penalty awarded by inflexible, unswerving justice on him who has placed me in a position so desperate.” As she uttered these words, with incredible energy and swiftness she flew upon Lothario with the naked dagger, so manifestly bent on burying it in his breast that he was almost uncertain whether these demonstrations were real or feigned, for he was obliged to have recourse to all his skill and strength to prevent her from striking him; and with such reality did she act this strange farce and mystification that, to give it a colour of truth, she determined to stain it with her own blood; for perceiving, or pretending, that she could not wound Lothario, she said, “Fate, it seems, will not grant my just desire complete satisfaction, but it will not be able to keep me from satisfying it partially at least;” and making an effort to free the hand with the dagger which Lothario held in his grasp, she released it, and directing the point to a place where it could not inflict a deep wound, she plunged it into her left side high up close to the shoulder, and then allowed herself to fall to the ground as if in a faint. Leonela and Lothario stood amazed and astounded at the catastrophe, and seeing Camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her blood they were still uncertain as to the true nature of the act. Lothario, terrified and breathless, ran in haste to pluck out the dagger; but when he saw how slight the wound was he was relieved of his fears and once more admired the subtlety, coolness, and ready wit of the fair Camilla; and the better to support the part he had to play he began to utter profuse and doleful lamentations over her body as if she were dead, invoking maledictions not only on himself but also on him who had been the means of placing him in such a position: and knowing that his friend Anselmo heard him he spoke in such a way as to make a listener feel much more pity for him than for Camilla, even though he supposed her dead. Leonela took her up in her arms and laid her on the bed, entreating Lothario to go in quest of some one to attend to her wound in secret, and at the same time asking his advice and opinion as to what they should say to Anselmo about his lady’s wound if he should chance to return before it was healed. He replied they might say what they liked, for he was not in a state to give advice that would be of any use; all he could tell her was to try and stanch the blood, as he was going where he should never more be seen; and with every appearance of deep grief and sorrow he left the house; but when he found himself alone, and where there was nobody to see him, he crossed himself unceasingly, lost in wonder at the adroitness of Camilla and the consistent acting of Leonela. He reflected how convinced Anselmo would be that he had a second Portia for a wife, and he looked forward anxiously to meeting him in order to rejoice together over falsehood and truth the most craftily veiled that could be imagined. Leonela, as he told her, stanched her lady’s blood, which was no more than sufficed to support her deception; and washing the wound with a little wine she bound it up to the best of her skill, talking all the time she was tending her in a strain that, even if nothing else had been said before, would have been enough to assure Anselmo that he had in Camilla a model of purity. To Leonela’s words Camilla added her own, calling herself cowardly and wanting in spirit, since she had not enough at the time she had most need of it to rid herself of the life she so much loathed. She asked her attendant’s advice as to whether or not she ought to inform her beloved husband of all that had happened, but the other bade her say nothing about it, as she would lay upon him the obligation of taking vengeance on Lothario, which he could not do but at great risk to himself; and it was the duty of a true wife not to give her husband provocation to quarrel, but, on the contrary, to remove it as far as possible from him. Camilla replied that she believed she was right and that she would follow her advice, but at any rate it would be well to consider how she was to explain the wound to Anselmo, for he could not help seeing it; to which Leonela answered that she did not know how to tell a lie even in jest. “How then can I know, my dear?” said Camilla, “for I should not dare to forge or keep up a falsehood if my life depended on it. If we can think of no escape from this difficulty, it will be better to tell him the plain truth than that he should find us out in an untrue story.” “Be not uneasy, senora,” said Leonela; “between this and to-morrow I will think of what we must say to him, and perhaps the wound being where it is it can be hidden from his sight, and Heaven will be pleased to aid us in a purpose so good and honourable. Compose yourself, senora, and endeavour to calm your excitement lest my lord find you agitated; and leave the rest to my care and God’s , who always supports good intentions.” Anselmo had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played out the tragedy of the death of his honour, which the performers acted with such wonderfully effective truth that it seemed as if they had become the realities of the parts they played. He longed for night and an opportunity of escaping from the house to go and see his good friend Lothario, and with him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl he had gained in having established his wife’s purity. Both mistress and maid took care to give him time and opportunity to get away, and taking advantage of it he made his escape, and at once went in quest of Lothario, and it would be impossible to describe how he embraced him when he found him, and the things he said to him in the joy of his heart, and the praises he bestowed upon Camilla; all which Lothario listened to without being able to show any pleasure, for he could not forget how deceived his friend was, and how dishonourably he had wronged him; and though Anselmo could see that Lothario was not glad, still he imagined it was only because he had left Camilla wounded and had been himself the cause of it; and so among other things he told him not to be distressed about Camilla’s accident, for, as they had agreed to hide it from him, the wound was evidently trifling; and that being so, he had no cause for fear, but should henceforward be of good cheer and rejoice with him, seeing that by his means and adroitness he found himself raised to the greatest height of happiness that he could have ventured to hope for, and desired no better pastime than making verses in praise of Camilla that would preserve her name for all time to come. Lothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own part to aid him in raising a monument so glorious. And so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be in the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument of his glory, led home by the hand him who had been the utter destruction of his good name; whom Camilla received with averted countenance, though with smiles in her heart. The deception was carried on for some time, until at the end of a few months Fortune turned her wheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad, and Anselmo paid with his life the penalty of his ill-advised curiosity. 常言道，军队不可无将军，城堡不可无长官。我觉得，一个年轻的已婚女子更不可身边无丈夫。特别需要的时候除外。没有你在身边，我的情况很不好，我简直忍受不了这种孤独。你如果不马上回来，我只好回我父母家去散心，不能为你照顾家了。我觉得你留给我的看护人，若是应当如此称呼他的话，他照顾更多的是他自己的利益，而不是你的利益。你是个聪明人，我不必再说，也不便再说什么了。 安塞尔莫收到了这封信。他根据信上说的，以为洛塔里奥已经开始行动，而且卡米拉也做出了他所希望的那种反应，感到很高兴。他给卡米拉带回口信，叫她无论如何不要离开家，他很快就会回来。卡米拉接到信后感到很意外，比以前更加迷惑不解了。她不敢离开自己家，也不敢到父母家去。留下来，她的名声可能会受到影响，可是，离开又违背了丈夫的命令。最后她作出了她认为是最坏的决定，也就是留下来，而且不躲避洛塔里奥，以免佣人们有什么议论。她后悔自己给丈夫写了那封信，生怕丈夫以为洛塔里奥发现她有些轻佻才敢放肆。不过她相信自己的情操，相信上帝，相信自己的良好愿望，所以，无论洛塔里奥再跟她说什么，她也不再告诉丈夫了，以免引起什么争执和麻烦。而且她还寻思，如果丈夫回来问她为何想起要写那封信，她应该如何为洛塔里奥开脱。 卡米拉的这些想法虽然用意良好，却并不正确，也是无益的。第二天，她一直听洛塔里奥说。洛塔里奥百般谄媚，渐渐动摇了卡米拉的意志。她竭力克制自己，不让洛塔里奥以眼泪和话语在她胸中激起的情感从她眼中有任何流露。洛塔里奥已经察觉到这些，于是欲火更旺。最后，他觉得应该利用安塞尔莫不在家的机会，加紧向这座堡垒进攻。他开始行动，对卡米拉的美貌大加赞扬。恐怕没有什么比虚荣更能攻破美女的高傲堡垒了。最后，洛塔里奥不择手段地用这种弹药攻破了她的洁身自好，卡米拉就是铁人也难以抵挡。洛塔里奥哭泣、乞求、许愿、吹捧、纠缠，装得情真意切。他装得很逼真，终于摧毁了卡米拉的防线，意想不到地得到了他求之不得的东西。 卡米拉投降了，卡米拉屈服了。可是这又怎么样呢？这是洛塔里奥的友谊控制不了的。这个例子明确告诉我们，只有逃避才能战胜情感。面对如此强大的对手，谁能无动于衷呢？要战胜人类这种本能，必须有一种神圣的力量。只有莱昂内拉知道卡米拉的脆弱。这两个丑恶朋友和新情人的事瞒不了她。洛塔里奥不想把安塞尔莫当初的意图告诉卡米拉，也没说是安塞尔莫提供条件让他们发展到了这一步。他不愿意让卡米拉小看他的爱情，认为他本意并不想来追求她。 几天后，安塞尔莫回到了自己家。他没有发现家里已缺少了一件东西，那件他最珍视却又忽略了的东西。随后，他去洛塔里奥家看望洛塔里奥。两人拥抱，安塞尔莫向洛塔里奥打听那件与自己性命攸关的事情。 “我可以告诉你的事情，安塞尔莫朋友，”洛塔里奥说，“就是你有一个堪称世界妇女楷模和典范的妻子。我对她说的那些话，她全都当成了耳旁风；我对她的许诺，她全都不放在眼里；我送给她的那些东西，她全都不接受；对我装出的几滴眼泪，她大加嘲笑。总之，卡米拉是美的精华，是个正直、稳重、端庄的人，集中了一个值得赞扬的幸福女人的所有美德。把你的钱拿回去吧，朋友，它在我手里已经毫无用处了。洁身自好的卡米拉不会向这种馈赠和诺言之类的玩艺儿屈服。你该高兴了，安塞尔莫，以后别再进行这类考验了。女人往往是造成困扰和猜疑的苦海，你既然蹒跚渡过了这个苦海，就不要再重新陷进去了。老天给了你这条船，让你用它渡过了尘世之海，你就不要再找其他船员去试验这艘船的品质和坚固性了。你应该意识到，你已经抵达了一个可爱的港湾，应该认真地停在那儿，等着上帝来召唤，没有任何贵人能逃避召唤的。” 安塞尔莫听了洛塔里奥这番话非常高兴，仿佛这是神谕似的，信以为真。尽管如此，他还是请求洛塔里奥把这件事继续做下去，不过现在只是出于好玩，当作消遣，而且也不用像以前那样用心计了。他只请求洛塔里奥写几首赞美诗，开头的名字用克洛莉，让卡米拉以为洛塔里奥爱上了一位叫克洛莉的小姐，这样就可以用这个名字来赞美卡米拉，而又不影响卡米拉安分守己的气节。如果洛塔里奥不愿意写，自己可以为他代劳。 “这没必要，”洛塔里奥说，“缪斯对我倒不那么陌生，每年都来看看我。你只管把你编的有关我的爱情故事告诉卡米拉吧，我来写诗。如果诗写得并不很扣主题，至少我也是尽我所能了。” 一个糊涂人和一个背叛了他的朋友就这样商定了。安塞尔莫回到家，问卡米拉为什么写信给他。而卡米拉正奇怪为什么安塞尔莫不问这件事呢。她说，原来觉得洛塔里奥比安塞尔莫在家时有些放肆，不过她已经看清了，是自己多心，因为洛塔里奥一直躲着她，避免同她单独在一起。安塞尔莫说，她完全可以放心了，因为他听说洛塔里奥已经爱上了城里一位尊贵的小姐，洛塔里奥还曾以克洛莉的名字为抬头，为她写诗呢。即使自己不在，也不必担心洛塔里奥的为人和他们两人之间的友谊。如果洛塔里奥事先没有告诉卡米拉，自己同克洛莉的爱情故事是虚构的，而且自己同安塞尔莫讲的那些诗实际上是赞美卡米拉的，卡米拉恐怕早就嫉妒了。由于事先已经知道了，卡米拉并没有感到意外或难过。 第二天，三个人坐在一起的时候，安塞尔莫请洛塔里奥说说他写给情人克洛莉的东西。卡米拉并不认识她，洛塔里奥想说什么都可以。 “即使卡米拉认识她，我也不隐瞒什么。”洛塔里奥说，“因为一个人赞美他的情人漂亮，并且说她冷酷，丝毫也不会影响她的名誉。不管怎么说，我告诉你们，我昨天为这个负心的克洛莉写了一首十四行诗。诗是这样写的：《十　四　行　诗》 夜色茫茫万籁静， 世人皆入甜蜜梦。 我对苍天和克洛莉 凄切诉说我不幸。 东方玫瑰红大门处， 朝阳初露冉冉升。 我又重新吐积怨， 唉声叹气诉不平。 太阳升起达金座， 光芒直射映大地， 哭泣愈频，呻吟更盛。 夜幕再降临，我又述 我的不幸，然而 老天装聋作哑，克洛莉也充耳不听。 卡米拉觉得这首诗不错，安塞尔莫更是赞不绝口，说那位小姐对这样的真情竟然不动声色，未免太残酷了。卡米拉接着说： “那么，那些坠入情网的诗人说的都是真的？” “诗人说的不一定是真的，”洛塔里奥说，“可那些坠入情网的人说得不多，却情真意切。” “说得对。”安塞尔莫支持洛塔里奥的说法。卡米拉不在意这是安塞尔莫的计策，她已经爱上了洛塔里奥。 卡米拉对与洛塔里奥有关的一切东西都感兴趣，而且她知道洛塔里奥想的、写的都是她，她才是真正的克洛莉。所以，她对洛塔里奥说，如果他还有什么诗，就请拿出来念念。 “有倒是有，”洛塔里奥说，“不过我觉得它不像刚才那首那么好，或者说，比刚才那首差。你们不妨自己来判断一下。 就是下面这首诗：《十　四　行　诗》 我会死去，即使我不信， 也必死无疑。 我会死在你脚下，负心的美人， 却并不后悔爱上了你。 我不会再被人记起， 没有了生命、荣耀和福气， 可你会看到，你美丽的面孔 已镌刻在我敞开的心里。 那是我临终的至宝。 你对我越冷酷， 我的追求越凌厉。 夜色漆黑，小船漂移， 浩海迷茫，路途漫漫， 不见港湾，不见北极。 安塞尔莫对这首诗也像对前面那首一样赞赏。这等于又增加了绕在他身上的侮辱他的锁链。洛塔里奥越是羞辱他，他越觉得光荣；卡米拉越是藐视他，他越觉得卡米拉品行端正，声名俱佳。后来有一次，卡米拉同她的女仆在一起，她对女仆说： “莱昂内拉朋友，我感到惭愧，自己竟那么不自重，让洛塔里奥没费多少时间就得到了我的真心。我怕他因为我这么轻易就把自己交给了他而鄙视我，却忘了他当初费了多少力，才使我不得不依从他。” “不用伤心，我的主人，”莱昂内拉说，“是否轻易就把自己交给了他，这并不重要，而且谁也不会因为轻易许人就被人鄙视，只要许得对，同样会受到尊重。俗话说，‘给得干脆，价值双倍’。” “不过俗话还说过，‘便宜没好货’。” “您别信那个，”莱昂内拉说，“我听说，爱情有时飞跑，有时漫步，对某些人不冷不热，对某些人炽热难当；它可以伤害一些人，也可以杀死一些人；它在一个地方产生，又在同一个地方泯灭；往往早晨还在围攻一个堡垒，傍晚就把堡垒攻破了，没有任何力量可以阻止爱情。既然这样，您还有什么可怕的？洛塔里奥也是如此，他趁我主人不在的时候，用爱情征服了您。爱情决定的事情必须趁安塞尔莫不在时完成，不能犹豫不决。等到安塞尔莫回来，事情就没法办了。爱情要如愿，最重要的是机会，尤其是在最初的阶段。这些事情我都清楚，不仅是听说来的，还有自己的经历。以后我会告诉您的，夫人，因为我也是有血有肉的少女。 “而且，卡米拉夫人，您是首先从洛塔里奥的眼睛、叹息、话语、许诺和馈赠里看到了他的一片心，又由他的心和种种品德看出他是个值得爱的人，然后才以身相许的。如果是这样，您就不应该胡思乱想了，应该相信洛塔里奥敬重您，就像您敬重他一样，他为您坠入情网而高兴满足，他是靠勇气和尊重猎取了您。他不仅具有人们说的一个好情人应具有的四点①，而且还具有完全的ABC特性②。您如果不信，听我给您背背看。我觉得，他这个人一感恩，二善良，三威武，四慷慨，五多情，六坚定，七英俊，八正直，九高贵，十忠诚，十一年轻，十二优秀，十三老实，十四显赫，十五豁达，十六富有，还有刚才说的那四点，接着是内向和真心。X就别说了，这个字母不好听。Y已经说过了。Z就是注重您的名誉。” ①即聪明、有个性、体贴人、能保密。 ②下面引述的形容词在原文中是按照字首字母的ABC顺序排列的。 卡米拉听到女仆的这番话不禁笑了，觉得她在谈情说爱方面也许做的比说的还内行。女仆向卡米拉承认，她正和本城一位出身高贵的青年谈情说爱。卡米拉有些慌了，怕发展下去会影响自己的声誉，赶紧追问她是否已经超越了谈与说。女仆也没什么不好意思，大大方方地说已经超越了。女仆看到上梁不正，也就不怕说下梁歪了。卡米拉只好求她别把自己同洛塔里奥的事告诉她的情人，而且对她自己的事也保密，千成别让安塞尔莫和洛塔里奥知道。 莱昂内拉说一定遵命，可她的行为确实让卡米拉担心，女仆的不检点会影响自己的名誉。大胆无耻的莱昂内拉自从发现女主人行为反常后，竟擅自让情人出入卡米拉的家。她相信女主人即使看见了，也不敢说出去。于是，就出现了女主人犯过失而带来的一种恶果，那就是她们自己反倒成了女仆的奴隶，不得不为女仆们掩饰其丑恶行径。卡米拉的情况就是如此。尽管她一再发现女仆同那个男青年在自己家的一个房间里，却不仅不敢说她，还得找地方让他们藏起来，为他们提供方便，以免让丈夫看到他们。可是有一天凌晨，洛塔里奥还是发现了那个青年。洛塔里奥不认识他，起初还以为是碰上了鬼影，但是见那人缩头缩脑地走路，马上就想到了另外一面。如果不是卡米拉及时补救，事情就全完了。洛塔里奥没有想到，那个人这种时候出入卡米拉家是为了莱昂内拉，他完全忘记了莱昂内拉在世界上的存在，只是想到卡米拉既然能轻易同他混到一起，也就很容易同别人混在一起。这就是罪恶女人得到的另一种恶果。她被殷勤和劝说引诱，投入了某个人的怀抱，丧失了自己的名誉，而那个人却以为她同样可以轻易地投入别人的怀抱，并且对自己的每一个猜疑都信以为真。洛塔里奥在这点上就考虑欠缺。他把自己以前的谨慎置于脑后，没有认真合理地考虑一下，就按捺不住胸中的嫉妒之火，一心要报复卡米拉。安塞尔莫还没起床，他就迫不及待地闯了进去，对安塞尔莫说： “你知道吧，安塞尔莫，这些天来，我的内心一直在斗争，极力想让自己不对你说这件事。可是现在不说不行了，而且也太不像话了。你该知道，卡米拉这座堡垒已经被攻破，我完全可以在那里为所欲为了。我原来没有告诉你真相，是想看看她究竟是一时糊涂还是为了考验我，坚贞地对待我按照你的吩咐同她建立的爱情。我原来觉得，如果她是咱们想象的那种正派女人，就会把我追求她的事告诉你。可是过了这么长时间，我就明白了，她原来对我说，你再出门的时候，她就在你保存贵重物品的内室里等我是真的（卡米拉确实有几次在那个地方等他）。我不想让你现在慌慌张张地报复，因为现在她还只是在想这件事，并没有去做。也可能从现在到开始行动的时候，卡米拉会有所改变，会后悔。你过去一直听从我的劝告，现在我再告诉你一个办法，你照着去做，就可以明白无误地以你认为最合适的方式解决问题。你还像前几次一样，装着外出两三天，然后再设法藏到你的内室里去吧。内室里有壁毯和其它东西，你可以舒舒服服地藏在里面，你用你的眼睛，我用我的眼睛，看看卡米拉到底想干什么。如果是什么意外的坏事，你也可以悄悄地、稳稳当当地、迅速地为你受到的伤害报仇了。” 安塞尔莫听了洛塔里奥这番话惊呆了。他以为卡米拉已经战胜了洛塔里奥的假意引诱，正享受胜利的快乐，万万没有料到事情竟是这样。过了很长一段时间，他默默无语，眼睛眨也不眨地盯着地面。最后他说： “洛塔里奥，你已经尽到了朋友的责任。现在我还得听你的。你随便怎么做，而且对这件意想不到的事情，你如果觉得有必要，就继续保密吧。” 洛塔里奥答应了。不过他刚一离开安塞尔莫，就后悔跟他说了这么多，觉得自己做得过分了。他自己完全可以报复卡米拉，没有必要采取这种残忍卑鄙的手段。他诅咒自己的这种想法，斥责自己这种轻率的决定，不知道如何才能挽回自己的这种做法或者找出某种合理的解决办法。最后他想起来，应该把这一切都告诉卡米拉。他们一直有很多机会见面。洛塔里奥当天就去找卡米拉。卡米拉正只身一人，一看到洛塔里奥就说： “你知道吧，洛塔里奥朋友，我心里很难受，觉得胸口快要炸了，不炸才怪呢。莱昂内拉太无耻了，她每天都把一个小伙子带到这个家里来，一直到天亮。这会大大损害我的名誉，谁看见那个小伙子在那种时候从我家出来，都会以为是我做了什么见不得人的事。最麻烦的就是我既不能惩罚她，也不能说她。她知道咱们的事情，因而我总是欲言又止，我怕这样早晚会坏了事。” 卡米拉刚开始说这件事时，洛塔里奥还以为卡米拉撒谎，说他看见的那个人是来找莱昂内拉，而不是来找她的。可后来看卡米拉哭得很难过，还让他想办法，才相信这是真的，于是他现在更加不知所措，更加后悔了。尽管如此，他还是让卡米拉不要着急，他会想办法不让莱昂内拉太放肆。同时他还告诉卡米拉，自己被嫉妒之火烧昏了头，已经把这件事告诉安塞尔莫了，并且同安塞尔莫约定，让安塞尔莫藏在内室里，这样可以清楚地看到卡米拉如何对他不忠。他请求卡米拉原谅自己的疯癫之举，并且请卡米拉设法把他从胡乱猜疑造成的这场麻烦中解脱出来。 卡米拉听了洛塔里奥的话吓坏了。她非常气愤而又非常得体地数落了洛塔里奥，批评了他的胡乱猜疑和轻率决定。不过卡米拉天生有应急的智慧，这点比洛塔里奥强。每当特别需要洛塔里奥拿主意的时候，他就没主意了。对于这样已经几乎无法挽回的事情，卡米拉马上就想出了补救办法。她对洛塔里奥说，一定要让安塞尔莫藏到他们那天商定的内室里去，她想利用安塞尔莫藏身这个机会，把事情说清楚，以便两人从此不再担惊受怕。不过，她没有把自己的全部想法都告诉洛塔里奥，只让他注意，安塞尔莫藏在内室里的时候，莱昂内拉一叫他，他就赶紧来，卡米拉问什么他就答什么，就好像不知道安塞尔莫能听见似的。洛塔里奥一定要卡米拉把自己的意图告诉他，这样他可以充分做好各种必要的准备。 “我问什么，你就答什么，没什么可准备的。”。卡米拉说，她不想把自己的想法告诉洛塔里奥，怕他不同意自己的想法又去寻找其他办法。她觉得自己的想法再好不过了。 洛塔里奥走了。第二天，安塞尔莫推说要到朋友的那个村庄去，离开了家，然后又折回来藏了起来。一切都很顺利，其实卡米拉和莱昂内拉都已经安排好了。 安塞尔莫藏了起来，想到要亲眼目睹这件关乎自己名誉的事到底是什么样子，自己眼看就会失掉心爱的卡米拉，他忐忑不安的心情可想而知。卡米拉和莱昂内拉断定安塞尔莫已经藏好，就走进了内室。脚刚落地，卡米拉就长吁了一口气，说道： “哎，莱昂内拉朋友！在我做那件事之前，我不想让你知道是什么事，免得你也来打扰我。我让你把安塞尔莫的那把短剑拿来，让它穿透我这卑鄙的胸膛，难道不好吗？不过你先不要这样做，我觉得替人受过是不合理的。首先我想知道，洛塔里奥那双肆无忌惮、恬不知耻的眼睛究竟在我这儿看到了什么，竟敢藐视他的朋友和我的名誉，在我面前大胆地表露他的丑恶想法。莱昂内拉，你到窗口去喊他。他肯定在街上等着实现他的罪恶企图呢。然而，他遇到的将是一个冷酷而又正直的我！” “哎呀，我的主人，”聪明而又知情的莱昂内拉说，“你想用这把短剑干什么？你难道想用它要自己的命或者要洛塔里奥的命吗？无论你要谁的命，都只会让你失掉自己的声誉。你最好还是装作不知道你受到的侮辱吧，别让这个恶毒的男人现在进入这个家，看到只有咱们两人。你看，夫人，咱们都是纤弱女子，他是个男人，而且横了心。他抱着疯狂的情欲目的而来，也许你还没对他怎么样，他就已经对你下手了，这比要你的命还糟糕。我的主人安塞尔莫也够可恨的，竟把自己的家交给了这个无耻之徒！我看出你是想杀掉他，可你就是把他杀了，咱们又怎么办呢？” “什么，朋友？”卡米拉说，“咱们把他扔在那儿，等安塞尔莫回来再埋。把自己的耻辱埋在地下应该是件惬意的事情。你去叫他来。拖延时间，不为我所受到的侮辱而报仇，就是对我忠实于丈夫的一种侮辱。” 这些话安塞尔莫全都听见了。卡米拉的每句话都对他有所触动。后来听到卡米拉想杀掉洛塔里奥，他就想出来，以免这种事情发生。不过，他又止住了，想等卡米拉这一正直的决心发展到一定程度，他再适时地出面阻止。 卡米拉这时突然感到一阵强烈的晕眩，扑倒在床上。莱昂内拉哭起来，说： “哎呀，你多么不幸呀，你竟死在我的怀抱里！你就是世上贞洁的集中代表，是所有善良女人的光荣，是洁身自好的典范！” 莱昂内拉又说了其它诸如此类的话，谁听了都会把她当成世界上最令人同情、最忠实的女仆，而把她的主人当成又一个受到迫害的佩涅洛佩①。 ①佩涅洛佩是《奥德赛》的主人公之一。丈夫奥德修斯外出二十年，她想出种种办法和借口摆脱求爱者的纠缠，是忠于丈夫的妻子之典范。 卡米拉一会儿醒过来了。她一醒来就说：","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4602.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
