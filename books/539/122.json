{"id":42262,"no":122,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 68","content":"The night was somewhat dark, for though there was a moon in the sky it was not in a quarter where she could be seen; for sometimes the lady Diana goes on a stroll to the antipodes, and leaves the mountains all black and the valleys in darkness. Don Quixote obeyed nature so far as to sleep his first sleep, but did not give way to the second, very different from Sancho, who never had any second, because with him sleep lasted from night till morning, wherein he showed what a sound constitution and few cares he had. Don Quixote’s cares kept him restless, so much so that he awoke Sancho and said to him, “I am amazed, Sancho, at the unconcern of thy temperament. I believe thou art made of marble or hard brass, incapable of any emotion or feeling whatever. I lie awake while thou sleepest, I weep while thou singest, I am faint with fasting while thou art sluggish and torpid from pure repletion. It is the duty of good servants to share the sufferings and feel the sorrows of their masters, if it be only for the sake of appearances. See the calmness of the night, the solitude of the spot, inviting us to break our slumbers by a vigil of some sort. Rise as thou livest, and retire a little distance, and with a good heart and cheerful courage give thyself three or four hundred lashes on account of Dulcinea’s disenchantment score; and this I entreat of thee, making it a request, for I have no desire to come to grips with thee a second time, as I know thou hast a heavy hand. As soon as thou hast laid them on we will pass the rest of the night, I singing my separation, thou thy constancy, making a beginning at once with the pastoral life we are to follow at our village.”\\n\\n “Senor,” replied Sancho, “I’m no monk to get up out of the middle of my sleep and scourge myself, nor does it seem to me that one can pass from one extreme of the pain of whipping to the other of music. Will your worship let me sleep, and not worry me about whipping myself? or you’ll make me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet, not to say my flesh.”\\n\\n “O hard heart!” said Don Quixote, “O pitiless squire! O bread ill-bestowed and favours ill-acknowledged, both those I have done thee and those I mean to do thee! Through me hast thou seen thyself a governor, and through me thou seest thyself in immediate expectation of being a count, or obtaining some other equivalent title, for I— post tenebras spero lucem.”\\n\\n “I don’t know what that is,” said Sancho; “all I know is that so long as I am asleep I have neither fear nor hope, trouble nor glory; and good luck betide him that invented sleep, the cloak that covers over all a man’s thoughts, the food that removes hunger, the drink that drives away thirst, the fire that warms the cold, the cold that tempers the heat, and, to wind up with, the universal coin wherewith everything is bought, the weight and balance that makes the shepherd equal with the king and the fool with the wise man. Sleep, I have heard say, has only one fault, that it is like death; for between a sleeping man and a dead man there is very little difference.”\\n\\n “Never have I heard thee speak so elegantly as now, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “and here I begin to see the truth of the proverb thou dost sometimes quote, ‘Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art fed.’”\\n\\n “Ha, by my life, master mine,” said Sancho, “it’s not I that am stringing proverbs now, for they drop in pairs from your worship’s mouth faster than from mine; only there is this difference between mine and yours, that yours are well-timed and mine are untimely; but anyhow, they are all proverbs.”\\n\\n At this point they became aware of a harsh indistinct noise that seemed to spread through all the valleys around. Don Quixote stood up and laid his hand upon his sword, and Sancho ensconced himself under Dapple and put the bundle of armour on one side of him and the ass’s pack-saddle on the other, in fear and trembling as great as Don Quixote’s perturbation. Each instant the noise increased and came nearer to the two terrified men, or at least to one, for as to the other, his courage is known to all. The fact of the matter was that some men were taking above six hundred pigs to sell at a fair, and were on their way with them at that hour, and so great was the noise they made and their grunting and blowing, that they deafened the ears of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and they could not make out what it was. The wide-spread grunting drove came on in a surging mass, and without showing any respect for Don Quixote’s dignity or Sancho’s, passed right over the pair of them, demolishing Sancho’s entrenchments, and not only upsetting Don Quixote but sweeping Rocinante off his feet into the bargain; and what with the trampling and the grunting, and the pace at which the unclean beasts went, pack-saddle, armour, Dapple and Rocinante were left scattered on the ground and Sancho and Don Quixote at their wits’ end.\\n\\n Sancho got up as well as he could and begged his master to give him his sword, saying he wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerly pigs, for he had by this time found out that that was what they were.\\n\\n “Let them be, my friend,” said Don Quixote; “this insult is the penalty of my sin; and it is the righteous chastisement of heaven that jackals should devour a vanquished knight, and wasps sting him and pigs trample him under foot.”\\n\\n “I suppose it is the chastisement of heaven, too,” said Sancho, “that flies should prick the squires of vanquished knights, and lice eat them, and hunger assail them. If we squires were the sons of the knights we serve, or their very near relations, it would be no wonder if the penalty of their misdeeds overtook us, even to the fourth generation. But what have the Panzas to do with the Quixotes? Well, well, let’s lie down again and sleep out what little of the night there’s left, and God will send us dawn and we shall be all right.”\\n\\n \\n\\n “Sleep thou, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “for thou wast born to sleep as I was born to watch; and during the time it now wants of dawn I will give a loose rein to my thoughts, and seek a vent for them in a little madrigal which, unknown to thee, I composed in my head last night.”\\n\\n “I should think,” said Sancho, “that the thoughts that allow one to make verses cannot be of great consequence; let your worship string verses as much as you like and I’ll sleep as much as I can;” and forthwith, taking the space of ground he required, he muffled himself up and fell into a sound sleep, undisturbed by bond, debt, or trouble of any sort. Don Quixote, propped up against the trunk of a beech or a cork tree — for Cide Hamete does not specify what kind of tree it was — sang in this strain to the accompaniment of his own sighs:\\n\\n When in my mind\\n\\n I muse, O Love, upon thy cruelty,\\n\\n To death I flee,\\n\\n In hope therein the end of all to find.\\n\\n But drawing near\\n\\n That welcome haven in my sea of woe,\\n\\n Such joy I know,\\n\\n That life revives, and still I linger here.\\n\\n Thus life doth slay,\\n\\n And death again to life restoreth me;\\n\\n Strange destiny,\\n\\n That deals with life and death as with a play!\\n\\n He accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears, just like one whose heart was pierced with grief at his defeat and his separation from Dulcinea.\\n\\n And now daylight came, and the sun smote Sancho on the eyes with his beams. He awoke, roused himself up, shook himself and stretched his lazy limbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his stores he cursed the drove, and more besides. Then the pair resumed their journey, and as evening closed in they saw coming towards them some ten men on horseback and four or five on foot. Don Quixote’s heart beat quick and Sancho’s quailed with fear, for the persons approaching them carried lances and bucklers, and were in very warlike guise. Don Quixote turned to Sancho and said, “If I could make use of my weapons, and my promise had not tied my hands, I would count this host that comes against us but cakes and fancy bread; but perhaps it may prove something different from what we apprehend.” The men on horseback now came up, and raising their lances surrounded Don Quixote in silence, and pointed them at his back and breast, menacing him with death. One of those on foot, putting his finger to his lips as a sign to him to be silent, seized Rocinante’s bridle and drew him out of the road, and the others driving Sancho and Dapple before them, and all maintaining a strange silence, followed in the steps of the one who led Don Quixote. The latter two or three times attempted to ask where they were taking him to and what they wanted, but the instant he began to open his lips they threatened to close them with the points of their lances; and Sancho fared the same way, for the moment he seemed about to speak one of those on foot punched him with a goad, and Dapple likewise, as if he too wanted to talk. Night set in, they quickened their pace, and the fears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as they heard themselves assailed with — “Get on, ye Troglodytes;” “Silence, ye barbarians;” “March, ye cannibals;” “No murmuring, ye Scythians;” “Don’t open your eyes, ye murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty lions,” and suchlike names with which their captors harassed the ears of the wretched master and man. Sancho went along saying to himself, “We, tortolites, barbers, animals! I don’t like those names at all; ‘it’s in a bad wind our corn is being winnowed;’ ‘misfortune comes upon us all at once like sticks on a dog,’ and God grant it may be no worse than them that this unlucky adventure has in store for us.”\\n\\n Don Quixote rode completely dazed, unable with the aid of all his wits to make out what could be the meaning of these abusive names they called them, and the only conclusion he could arrive at was that there was no good to be hoped for and much evil to be feared. And now, about an hour after midnight, they reached a castle which Don Quixote saw at once was the duke’s , where they had been but a short time before. “God bless me!” said he, as he recognised the mansion, “what does this mean? It is all courtesy and politeness in this house; but with the vanquished good turns into evil, and evil into worse.”\\n\\n They entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared and fitted up in a style that added to their amazement and doubled their fears, as will be seen in the following chapter.\\n\\n \\n\\n 那天晚上比较黑。虽然月亮仍在天上，可就是不愿露面。这位狄安娜夫人大概到地球的另一面去散步了，结果弄得山谷都是黑乎乎的。唐吉诃德只打了个盹儿，就再也没睡着。桑乔却相反，一觉睡到大天亮，一看就知道是个心宽体胖的人。唐吉诃德心事重重，睡不着，只好把桑乔叫醒，对他说道：\\n\\n “桑乔，我对你什么都不在乎的脾气真感到惊讶。你大概是石凿的或铁打的，什么时候都无动于衷。我守夜时你睡觉，我哭泣时你唱歌，我饿得头昏眼花时你却撑得直犯懒。好佣人应该为主人分忧，忧主人之忧嘛。你看这夜色多么清幽，万籁俱寂，仿佛在邀请我们从梦中醒来，与它共度良宵呢。赶紧起来吧，往远处走一点儿，拿出点儿勇气和报恩的精神来，打自己三四百鞭子，为了让杜尔西内亚摆脱魔法而把欠的帐还上一部分吧。我求求你，我不想像上次那样跟你动手了。你打完自己之后，今夜剩下的时间咱们就唱歌儿。我倾诉我的相思，你赞颂你的忠贞。回村以后那种牧羊的生活咱们现在就可以开始了。”\\n\\n “大人，”桑乔说，“我又不是苦行僧，没必要半夜三更起来鞭挞自己，而且我也不信鞭挞的痛苦能转化为快乐的歌声。您还是让我睡觉吧，别再逼我抽打自己了，不然的话我发誓，以后别说碰我的皮肉，就连衣服上的一根细毛儿也休想碰我！”\\n\\n “多狠的心肠呀！多么冷酷的侍从呀！我白养活你了，我对你的照顾和以后会给你的照顾，你全忘记了！你靠着我才当上了总督，你靠着我才有望获得伯爵或者类似的称号，而且在过了这一年之后，这个诺言很快就会实现。黑暗即将过去，曙光就在前头呀。”\\n\\n “这些我不懂，”桑乔说，“我只知道在我睡觉的时候，既没有感到痛苦，也没有感到希望，没有辛劳，也没有荣耀。不知是谁发明了睡眠，真该感谢他。睡眠消除了人类的一切思想，成了解饥的饭食，解渴的清水，驱寒的火焰，驱热的清凉，一句话，睡眠是可以买到一切东西的货币；无论是国王还是平民，无论是智者还是傻瓜，它都像个天平，一视同仁。我听说睡眠只有一点不好，那就是和死差不多，睡着了的人就像死人一样。”\\n\\n “我从没有听到你像现在这样慷慨陈词，”唐吉诃德说，“由此我认识到，你的一句口头语说得很对：‘出身并不重要，关键是跟谁过。’”\\n\\n “见鬼去吧，我的大人，”桑乔说，“现在并不是我张口就是俗语，而是您动不动就来两句俗语，而且比我说得更多！您和我之间只有一个区别，那就是您比我说得恰当，我说得常常对不上号。但是不管怎么说，它们都是俗语。”\\n\\n 这时，他们忽然听到一阵沉闷的嘈杂声以及凄厉的声音响彻了谷地。唐吉诃德站起来，手握剑柄；桑乔则赶紧钻到驴下面，用驴驮的盔甲和驮鞍挡住自己。桑乔吓得直发抖，唐吉诃德也茫然不知所措。声音越来越大，离他们越来越近，把其中一个人吓得够呛，而另一个人的胆量是大家都知道的。原来，是有人赶着六百多头猪到集上去卖，正好从那儿路过。那群猪呼哧着鼻子拼命地叫，把唐吉诃德和桑乔的耳朵都快震聋了，因而他们已经分不清那到底是什么声音了。大群的猪浩浩荡荡地呼叫着开过来，根本不理会唐吉诃德和桑乔的尊严。它们冲破了桑乔的防御工事，不仅撞倒了唐吉诃德，顺便还把罗西南多也带倒了。那群愚蠢的牲畜迅速地冲过来，把驮鞍、盔甲、驴、罗西南多、桑乔和唐吉诃德都掀翻在地，一片狼藉。桑乔挣扎着站起来，向唐吉诃德要剑，说要把这帮粗鲁的猪大爷宰掉几个。唐吉诃德对桑乔说道：\\n\\n “算了吧，朋友，是我造了孽，咱们才受到这种冒犯。这是上帝对一个战败的游侠骑士的惩罚。战败的游侠骑士就应该被狼啃，被蜂蜇，被猪踩！”\\n\\n “这也是老天对战败骑士的侍从的惩罚。”桑乔说，“这样的侍从就应该被蚊虫叮，被虱子咬，忍饥挨饿。假如我们这些侍从是我们服侍的骑士的儿子或者什么近亲，那就是把我们惩罚到第三代或者第四代也不为过。可是，桑乔家族跟唐吉诃德家族有什么关系呀？好了，咱们还是先歇着吧。天快亮了，咱们再睡一会儿，有什么事天亮再说吧。”\\n\\n “你去睡吧，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“你就知道睡觉！我可要守夜。在天亮之前的这段时间里，我要丢开我的思绪，做一首情诗。你不知道，昨天晚上我就已经打好腹稿了。”\\n\\n “依我看，”桑乔说，“想做诗的心情也没什么了不起的。您愿意怎么做诗就怎么做吧，我反正是能睡多少就睡多少。”\\n\\n 然后，他随意躺到了地上，蜷缩成一团，进入了梦乡，什么欠帐、痛苦之类的事情，全都置之脑后了。唐吉诃德靠着一棵山毛榉或者栓皮槠，锡德·哈迈德·贝嫩赫利没说清是什么树，唉声叹气地念起诗来：\\n\\n 每当我想着你，爱情，\\n\\n 都是对我的痛苦折磨。\\n\\n 我真想奔向死亡，\\n\\n 从此把无穷的痛苦摆脱。\\n\\n 然而当我到达死亡的边缘，\\n\\n 却又裹足不前；\\n\\n 爱情给我带来了如此的欢乐，\\n\\n 欲死不忍心，生活更执著。\\n\\n 我总是虽生求死，\\n\\n 死又复活；\\n\\n 生生死死，\\n\\n 百般蹉跎①！\\n\\n ①这是意大利诗人佩德罗·本博的一首情诗。\\n\\n 唐吉诃德念着诗，叹着气，泪眼潸然，心中似乎为自己战败和思念杜尔西内亚而痛苦万分。\\n\\n 天亮了，阳光照到了桑乔的眼睛上。他起身伸了个懒腰，活动了一下四肢，望着自己带的干粮被猪群毁得一片狼藉，不禁又诅咒起来，而且骂的还不仅仅是那群猪。后来，唐吉诃德和桑乔又继续赶路。下午，他们看到迎面走来近十个骑马的人和四五个步行的人。唐吉诃德不由得心情紧张起来，桑乔也吓得够呛，因为那些人手持长矛和盾牌，一副气势汹汹的样子。唐吉诃德转身对桑乔说：\\n\\n “桑乔，如果不是我的诺言束缚了我的手脚，如果我还能操持武器的话，我完全可以把对面来的这群人打得落花流水，那么情况就不一样了。”\\n\\n 这时，那几个骑马的人手持长矛，一声不响地围住了唐吉诃德，分别用长矛指着他的前胸和后背。一个步行的人把手放在嘴边上，示意唐吉诃德别出声，抓着罗西南多的笼头，把它牵出了大路。其他几个步行的人揪着桑乔的驴，非常奇怪地一句话也不说，跟在唐吉诃德他们后面。唐吉诃德几次想开口问他们要把自己带到哪里去，想干什么，可是刚一开口，就有人用长矛的铁头指指他，示意他住嘴。桑乔的情况也一样，他刚要说话，就有人用带刺的棍子捅他，而且还捅他的驴，仿佛驴也想说话似的。夜色降临，那几个人加快了脚步，唐吉诃德和桑乔也更紧张了，尤其是听到那几个人不时地么喝：\\n\\n “快走，你们这两个野人！”\\n\\n “住嘴，蠢货！”\\n\\n “小心点儿，你们这两个吃人的家伙！”\\n\\n “别吭声，够了！不许把眼睛瞪那么大，你们这两个杀人的魔鬼，吃人不吐骨头的野狮！”\\n\\n 那几个人还骂了其他一些话，唐吉诃德和桑乔听着都十分刺耳。桑乔心里说：“我们怎么‘噎人’，怎么‘闯祸’，又怎么成‘痴人’和‘野屎’①啦？这些话真不好听。真是屋漏偏逢下雨，人不顺心连喝凉水都塞牙缝儿。但愿这场灾祸到此为止吧。”\\n\\n ①桑乔没听清楚那几个人喊的话，误作声音相近的词了。\\n\\n 唐吉诃德也同样莫名其妙，猜不透那些人为什么用这些词骂他和桑乔，但他估计是凶多吉少。\\n\\n 他们在黑夜中走了大约一小时，来到一座城堡前。唐吉诃德认出那是他们前不久还住过的公爵城堡。\\n\\n “上帝保佑！”唐吉诃德说道，“这是怎么回事呀？这儿原先是热情好客的地方，可是，对战败的人连好地方也变坏了，坏地方就变得更糟糕了。”\\n\\n 他们进了城堡的院子。看到里面的陈设，唐吉诃德和桑乔更惊奇，也更害怕了。详情请看下章。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4689.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
