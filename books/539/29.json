{"id":42169,"no":29,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 28","content":"Happy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight Don Quixote of La Mancha was sent into the world; for by reason of his having formed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive and restore to the world the long-lost and almost defunct order of knight-errantry, we now enjoy in this age of ours, so poor in light entertainment, not only the charm of his veracious history, but also of the tales and episodes contained in it which are, in a measure, no less pleasing, ingenious, and truthful, than the history itself; which, resuming its thread, carded, spun, and wound, relates that just as the curate was going to offer consolation to Cardenio, he was interrupted by a voice that fell upon his ear saying in plaintive tones: “O God! is it possible I have found a place that may serve as a secret grave for the weary load of this body that I support so unwillingly? If the solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah! woe is me! how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of these rocks and brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to Heaven, than that of any human being, for there is none on earth to look to for counsel in doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!” All this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him, and as it seemed to them to be uttered close by, as indeed it was, they got up to look for the speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces they discovered behind a rock, seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth in the dress of a peasant, whose face they were unable at the moment to see as he was leaning forward, bathing his feet in the brook that flowed past. They approached so silently that he did not perceive them, being fully occupied in bathing his feet, which were so fair that they looked like two pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the other stones of the brook. The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them with surprise, for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods or to follow the plough and the oxen as their owner’s dress suggested; and so, finding they had not been noticed, the curate, who was in front, made a sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock that lay there; which they did, observing closely what the youth was about. He had on a loose double-skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to his body with a white cloth; he wore besides breeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and on his head a brown montera; and he had the gaiters turned up as far as the middle of the leg, which verily seemed to be of pure alabaster. As soon as he had done bathing his beautiful feet, he wiped them with a towel he took from under the montera, on taking off which he raised his face, and those who were watching him had an opportunity of seeing a beauty so exquisite that Cardenio said to the curate in a whisper: “As this is not Luscinda, it is no human creature but a divine being.” The youth then took off the montera, and shaking his head from side to side there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of the sun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed a peasant was a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of them had ever beheld, or even Cardenio’s if they had not seen and known Luscinda, for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of Luscinda could compare with this. The long auburn tresses not only covered her shoulders, but such was their length and abundance, concealed her all round beneath their masses, so that except the feet nothing of her form was visible. She now used her hands as a comb, and if her feet had seemed like bits of crystal in the water, her hands looked like pieces of driven snow among her locks; all which increased not only the admiration of the three beholders, but their anxiety to learn who she was. With this object they resolved to show themselves, and at the stir they made in getting upon their feet the fair damsel raised her head, and parting her hair from before her eyes with both hands, she looked to see who had made the noise, and the instant she perceived them she started to her feet, and without waiting to put on her shoes or gather up her hair, hastily snatched up a bundle as though of clothes that she had beside her, and, scared and alarmed, endeavoured to take flight; but before she had gone six paces she fell to the ground, her delicate feet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; seeing which, the three hastened towards her, and the curate addressing her first said: “Stay, senora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here only desire to be of service to you; you have no need to attempt a flight so heedless, for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it.” Taken by surprise and bewildered, she made no reply to these words. They, however, came towards her, and the curate taking her hand went on to say: “What your dress would hide, senora, is made known to us by your hair; a clear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your beauty in a garb so unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes like these where we have had the good fortune to find you, if not to relieve your distress, at least to offer you comfort; for no distress, so long as life lasts, can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make the sufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention. And so, senora, or senor, or whatever you prefer to be, dismiss the fears that our appearance has caused you and make us acquainted with your good or evil fortunes, for from all of us together, or from each one of us, you will receive sympathy in your trouble.” While the curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as if spell-bound, looking at them without opening her lips or uttering a word, just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has never seen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressing some further words to the same effect to her, sighing deeply she broke silence and said: “Since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me, and the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to deal in falsehoods, it would be idle for me now to make any further pretence of what, if you were to believe me, you would believe more out of courtesy than for any other reason. This being so, I say I thank you, sirs, for the offer you have made me, which places me under the obligation of complying with the request you have made of me; though I fear the account I shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in you as much concern as compassion, for you will be unable to suggest anything to remedy them or any consolation to alleviate them. However, that my honour may not be left a matter of doubt in your minds, now that you have discovered me to be a woman, and see that I am young, alone, and in this dress, things that taken together or separately would be enough to destroy any good name, I feel bound to tell what I would willingly keep secret if I could.” All this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without any hesitation, with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they were not less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty, and as they again repeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her promise, she without further pressing, first modestly covering her feet and gathering up her hair, seated herself on a stone with the three placed around her, and, after an effort to restrain some tears that came to her eyes, in a clear and steady voice began her story thus: “In this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title which makes him one of those that are called Grandees of Spain. This nobleman has two sons, the elder heir to his dignity and apparently to his good qualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it be the treachery of Vellido and the falsehood of Ganelon. My parents are this lord’s vassals, lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth had conferred as much on them as fortune, they would have had nothing left to desire, nor should I have had reason to fear trouble like that in which I find myself now; for it may be that my ill fortune came of theirs in not having been nobly born. It is true they are not so low that they have any reason to be ashamed of their condition, but neither are they so high as to remove from my mind the impression that my mishap comes of their humble birth. They are, in short, peasants, plain homely people, without any taint of disreputable blood, and, as the saying is, old rusty Christians, but so rich that by their wealth and free-handed way of life they are coming by degrees to be considered gentlefolk by birth, and even by position; though the wealth and nobility they thought most of was having me for their daughter; and as they have no other child to make their heir, and are affectionate parents, I was one of the most indulged daughters that ever parents indulged. “I was the mirror in which they beheld themselves, the staff of their old age, and the object in which, with submission to Heaven, all their wishes centred, and mine were in accordance with theirs, for I knew their worth; and as I was mistress of their hearts, so was I also of their possessions. Through me they engaged or dismissed their servants; through my hands passed the accounts and returns of what was sown and reaped; the oil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the flocks and herds, the beehives, all in short that a rich farmer like my father has or can have, I had under my care, and I acted as steward and mistress with an assiduity on my part and satisfaction on theirs that I cannot well describe to you. The leisure hours left to me after I had given the requisite orders to the head-shepherds, overseers, and other labourers, I passed in such employments as are not only allowable but necessary for young girls, those that the needle, embroidery cushion, and spinning wheel usually afford, and if to refresh my mind I quitted them for a while, I found recreation in reading some devotional book or playing the harp, for experience taught me that music soothes the troubled mind and relieves weariness of spirit. Such was the life I led in my parents’ house and if I have depicted it thus minutely, it is not out of ostentation, or to let you know that I am rich, but that you may see how, without any fault of mine, I have fallen from the happy condition I have described, to the misery I am in at present. The truth is, that while I was leading this busy life, in a retirement that might compare with that of a monastery, and unseen as I thought by any except the servants of the house (for when I went to Mass it was so early in the morning, and I was so closely attended by my mother and the women of the household, and so thickly veiled and so shy, that my eyes scarcely saw more ground than I trod on), in spite of all this, the eyes of love, or idleness, more properly speaking, that the lynx’s cannot rival, discovered me, with the help of the assiduity of Don Fernando; for that is the name of the younger son of the duke I told of.” The moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardenio changed colour and broke into a sweat, with such signs of emotion that the curate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the mad fits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; but Cardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet, regarding the peasant girl with fixed attention, for he began to suspect who she was. She, however, without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuing her story, went on to say: “And they had hardly discovered me, when, as he owned afterwards, he was smitten with a violent love for me, as the manner in which it displayed itself plainly showed. But to shorten the long recital of my woes, I will pass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don Fernando for declaring his passion for me. He bribed all the household, he gave and offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was like a holiday or a merry-making in our street; by night no one could sleep for the music; the love letters that used to come to my hand, no one knew how, were innumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges, containing more promises and oaths than there were letters in them; all which not only did not soften me, but hardened my heart against him, as if he had been my mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make me yield were done with the opposite intention. Not that the high-bred bearing of Don Fernando was disagreeable to me, or that I found his importunities wearisome; for it gave me a certain sort of satisfaction to find myself so sought and prized by a gentleman of such distinction, and I was not displeased at seeing my praises in his letters (for however ugly we women may be, it seems to me it always pleases us to hear ourselves called beautiful) but that my own sense of right was opposed to all this, as well as the repeated advice of my parents, who now very plainly perceived Don Fernando’s purpose, for he cared very little if all the world knew it. They told me they trusted and confided their honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, and bade me consider the disparity between Don Fernando and myself, from which I might conclude that his intentions, whatever he might say to the contrary, had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage; and if I were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to his unreasonable suit, they were ready, they said, to marry me at once to anyone I preferred, either among the leading people of our own town, or of any of those in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth and my good name, a match might be looked for in any quarter. This offer, and their sound advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernando a word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success, however remote. “All this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, had apparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite — for that is the name I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it to be, you would not know of it now, because there would have been no occasion to tell you of it. At length he learned that my parents were contemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes of obtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectors to watch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as you shall hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no other companion than a damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefully locked lest my honour should be imperilled through any carelessness, I know not nor can conceive how it happened, but, with all this seclusion and these precautions, and in the solitude and silence of my retirement, I found him standing before me, a vision that so astounded me that it deprived my eyes of sight, and my tongue of speech. I had no power to utter a cry, nor, I think, did he give me time to utter one, as he immediately approached me, and taking me in his arms (for, overwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to help myself), he began to make such professions to me that I know not how falsehood could have had the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth; and the traitor contrived that his tears should vouch for his words, and his sighs for his sincerity. “I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases such as this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying protestations true, though without being moved by his sighs and tears to anything more than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of bewilderment passed away, and I began in some degree to recover myself, I said to him with more courage than I thought I could have possessed, ‘If, as I am now in your arms, senor, I were in the claws of a fierce lion, and my deliverance could be procured by doing or saying anything to the prejudice of my honour, it would no more be in my power to do it or say it, than it would be possible that what was should not have been; so then, if you hold my body clasped in your arms, I hold my soul secured by virtuous intentions, very different from yours, as you will see if you attempt to carry them into effect by force. I am your vassal, but I am not your slave; your nobility neither has nor should have any right to dishonour or degrade my humble birth; and low-born peasant as I am, I have my self-respect as much as you, a lord and gentleman: with me your violence will be to no purpose, your wealth will have no weight, your words will have no power to deceive me, nor your sighs or tears to soften me: were I to see any of the things I speak of in him whom my parents gave me as a husband, his will should be mine, and mine should be bounded by his; and my honour being preserved even though my inclinations were not would willingly yield him what you, senor, would now obtain by force; and this I say lest you should suppose that any but my lawful husband shall ever win anything of me.’ ‘If that,’ said this disloyal gentleman, ‘be the only scruple you feel, fairest Dorothea’ (for that is the name of this unhappy being), ‘see here I give you my hand to be yours, and let Heaven, from which nothing is hid, and this image of Our Lady you have here, be witnesses of this pledge.’” When Cardenio heard her say she was called Dorothea, he showed fresh agitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion, but he was unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished to hear the end of what he already all but knew, so he merely said: “What! is Dorothea your name, senora? I have heard of another of the same name who can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed; by-and-by I may tell you something that will astonish you as much as it will excite your compassion.” Dorothea was struck by Cardenio’s words as well as by his strange and miserable attire, and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to tell it to her at once, for if fortune had left her any blessing it was courage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her, as she felt sure that none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she endured already. “I would not let the occasion pass, senora,” replied Cardenio, “of telling you what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so far there has been no opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you to know it.” “Be it as it may,” replied Dorothea, “what happened in my story was that Don Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it as a witness of our betrothal, and with the most binding words and extravagant oaths gave me his promise to become my husband; though before he had made an end of pledging himself I bade him consider well what he was doing, and think of the anger his father would feel at seeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his vassals; I told him not to let my beauty, such as it was, blind him, for that was not enough to furnish an excuse for his transgression; and if in the love he bore me he wished to do me any kindness, it would be to leave my lot to follow its course at the level my condition required; for marriages so unequal never brought happiness, nor did they continue long to afford the enjoyment they began with. “All this that I have now repeated I said to him, and much more which I cannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his purpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself about difficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time I argued the matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, ‘I shall not be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station, nor will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more likely, a blind attachment, has led to mate himself below his rank. Then, since I am introducing no new usage or practice, I may as well avail myself of the honour that chance offers me, for even though his inclination for me should not outlast the attainment of his wishes, I shall be, after all, his wife before God. And if I strive to repel him by scorn, I can see that, fair means failing, he is in a mood to use force, and I shall be left dishonoured and without any means of proving my innocence to those who cannot know how innocently I have come to be in this position; for what arguments would persuade my parents that this gentleman entered my chamber without my consent?’ “All these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment; but the oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he appealed to, the tears he shed, and lastly the charms of his person and his high-bred grace, which, accompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well have conquered a heart even more free and coy than mine — these were the things that more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to my ruin. I called my waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witness on earth besides those in Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed and repeated his oaths, invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to the former ones, called down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter should he fail to keep his promise, shed more tears, redoubled his sighs and pressed me closer in his arms, from which he had never allowed me to escape; and so I was left by my maid, and ceased to be one, and he became a traitor and a perjured man. “The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so quickly, I imagine, as Don Fernando wished, for when desire has attained its object, the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of pleasure. I say so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me, and by the adroitness of my maid, who was indeed the one who had admitted him, gained the street before daybreak; but on taking leave of me he told me, though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he came, that I might rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and sincerity of his oaths; and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring off his finger and placed it upon mine. He then took his departure and I was left, I know not whether sorrowful or happy; all I can say is, I was left agitated and troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what had taken place, and I had not the spirit, or else it did not occur to me, to chide my maid for the treachery she had been guilty of in concealing Don Fernando in my chamber; for as yet I was unable to make up my mind whether what had befallen me was for good or evil. I told Don Fernando at parting, that as I was now his, he might see me on other nights in the same way, until it should be his pleasure to let the matter become known; but, except the following night, he came no more, nor for more than a month could I catch a glimpse of him in the street or in church, while I wearied myself with watching for one; although I knew he was in the town, and almost every day went out hunting, a pastime he was very fond of. I remember well how sad and dreary those days and hours were to me; I remember well how I began to doubt as they went by, and even to lose confidence in the faith of Don Fernando; and I remember, too, how my maid heard those words in reproof of her audacity that she had not heard before, and how I was forced to put a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my countenance, not to give my parents cause to ask me why I was so melancholy, and drive me to invent falsehoods in reply. But all this was suddenly brought to an end, for the time came when all such considerations were disregarded, and there was no further question of honour, when my patience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad. The reason was, that a few days later it was reported in the town that Don Fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of rare beauty, the daughter of parents of distinguished position, though not so rich that her portion would entitle her to look for so brilliant a match; it was said, too, that her name was Luscinda, and that at the betrothal some strange things had happened.” Cardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he only shrugged his shoulders, bit his lips, bent his brows, and before long two streams of tears escaped from his eyes. Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her story, but went on in these words: “This sad intelligence reached my ears, and, instead of being struck with a chill, with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that I scarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the streets, crying aloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was the victim; but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a resolution I formed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to assume this dress, which I got from a servant of my father’s , one of the zagals, as they are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the whole of my misfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to the city where I heard my enemy was. He, though he remonstrated with me for my boldness, and condemned my resolution, when he saw me bent upon my purpose, offered to bear me company, as he said, to the end of the world. I at once packed up in a linen pillow-case a woman’s dress, and some jewels and money to provide for emergencies, and in the silence of the night, without letting my treacherous maid know, I sallied forth from the house, accompanied by my servant and abundant anxieties, and on foot set out for the city, but borne as it were on wings by my eagerness to reach it, if not to prevent what I presumed to be already done, at least to call upon Don Fernando to tell me with what conscience he had done it. I reached my destination in two days and a half, and on entering the city inquired for the house of Luscinda’s parents. The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I sought to know; he showed me the house, and told me all that had occurred at the betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of such notoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in the street. He said that on the night of Don Fernando’s betrothal with Luscinda, as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying ‘Yes,’ she was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroom approaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he found a paper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared that she could not be Don Fernando’s bride, because she was already Cardenio’s , who, according to the man’s account, was a gentleman of distinction of the same city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was only in obedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the paper made it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the betrothal, and gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which was confirmed, it was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her clothes. On seeing this, Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had befooled, slighted, and trifled with him, assailed her before she had recovered from her swoon, and tried to stab her with the dagger that had been found, and would have succeeded had not her parents and those who were present prevented him. It was said, moreover, that Don Fernando went away at once, and that Luscinda did not recover from her prostration until the next day, when she told her parents how she was really the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I learned besides that Cardenio, according to report, had been present at the betrothal; and that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation, he had quitted the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaring the wrong Luscinda had done him, and his intention of going where no one should ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in the city, and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that Luscinda was missing from her father’s house and from the city, for she was not to be found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, who knew not what steps to take to recover her. What I learned revived my hopes, and I was better pleased not to have found Don Fernando than to find him married, for it seemed to me that the door was not yet entirely shut upon relief in my case, and I thought that perhaps Heaven had put this impediment in the way of the second marriage, to lead him to recognise his obligations under the former one, and reflect that as a Christian he was bound to consider his soul above all human objects. All this passed through my mind, and I strove to comfort myself without comfort, indulging in faint and distant hopes of cherishing that life that I now abhor. “But while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, as I could not find Don Fernando, I heard notice given by the public crier offering a great reward to anyone who should find me, and giving the particulars of my age and of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad who came with me had taken me away from my father’s house; a thing that cut me to the heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it was not enough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add with whom I had fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my consideration. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with my servant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to me, and the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the most thickly wooded part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, one evil calls up another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the beginning of one still greater, and so it proved in my case; for my worthy servant, until then so faithful and trusty when he found me in this lonely spot, moved more by his own villainy than by my beauty, sought to take advantage of the opportunity which these solitudes seemed to present him, and with little shame and less fear of God and respect for me, began to make overtures to me; and finding that I replied to the effrontery of his proposals with justly severe language, he laid aside the entreaties which he had employed at first, and began to use violence. But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid good intentions, so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little exertion I pushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether dead or alive I know not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible in my terror and fatigue, I made my way into the mountains, without any other thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them, and escaping my father and those despatched in search of me by his orders. It is now I know not how many months since with this object I came here, where I met a herdsman who engaged me as his servant at a place in the heart of this Sierra, and all this time I have been serving him as herd, striving to keep always afield to hide these locks which have now unexpectedly betrayed me. But all my care and pains were unavailing, for my master made the discovery that I was not a man, and harboured the same base designs as my servant; and as fortune does not always supply a remedy in cases of difficulty, and I had no precipice or ravine at hand down which to fling the master and cure his passion, as I had in the servant’s case, I thought it a lesser evil to leave him and again conceal myself among these crags, than make trial of my strength and argument with him. So, as I say, once more I went into hiding to seek for some place where I might with sighs and tears implore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and grant me help and strength to escape from it, or let me die among the solitudes, leaving no trace of an unhappy being who, by no fault of hers, has furnished matter for talk and scandal at home and abroad.” 曼查英勇无比的骑士唐吉诃德降生的年代真乃幸运之至，他竟堂而皇之地要重建几乎已在世界上销声匿迹的游侠骑士，以至于我们在这个需要笑料的时代里，不仅可以了解他的真实历史，而且还可以欣赏到他的一些奇闻轶事。有些部分真真假假，其有趣的程度并不亚于他那条理清晰、情节错综曲折的历史本身。上面说到神甫正想安慰卡德尼奥几句，耳边却传来一个声音。神甫止住话，只听那声音语调凄切地说道： “啊，上帝！我大概已经找到了可以秘密埋葬我这违心支撑的沉重身体的墓地！这孤寂的山脉肯定没有欺骗我。不幸之人啊，唯有这岩石草丛与我相随，给我一席之地，让我能够把我的不幸向天倾诉。当今之世，已经没有任何人可以与我为伴，遇迷津给我指点，遇忧怨给我安慰，遇困难给我帮助！” 这些话神甫和另外两个人都听得清清楚楚，觉得声音就是从附近发出的。事实正是如此。于是他们起身寻找那个说话人，走了不到二十步远，就在一块岩石后面发现，一个农夫打扮的小伙子正坐在一棵白蜡树下。他正低头在一条小溪里洗脚，因此看不见他的脸。他们悄悄走过去，那人竟一点也没有察觉，只顾自己专心致志地洗脚。与小溪中的石头相比，他那两只脚简直像两块白玉。 大家对着那两只又白又漂亮的脚发怔，觉得那可不是两只可以在泥土里耕种的脚，不是像他那种打扮的人的脚。既然没有被发现，走在前面的神甫就向另外两个人做了手势，示意他们在石头后面藏起来。藏好后，三人仔细看那人在干什么。小伙子上身穿一件棕褐色双兜短斗篷，一条白毛巾把斗篷紧紧束在身上；下身着棕褐色呢裤和裹腿，头戴一顶棕褐色帽子。裹腿裹住了半条肯定也是白石膏一般的腿。小伙子洗完他的纤秀的脚，从帽子下面抽出头巾，把脚擦干了。他抽头巾时抬了一下头，大家才看见他无比美貌。卡德尼奥对神甫低声说： “这个人若不是卢辛达，那就不是凡人，是仙人。” 小伙子把帽子摘下来，向两侧甩了甩，头发开始散落下来，那潇洒的样子，连太阳见了都会嫉妒。这时大家才看清那个貌似小伙子的人竟是个娇嫩女子。神甫和理发师从未见过如此漂亮的女人。卡德尼奥若不是早就认识了卢辛达，也大开眼界了。卡德尼奥断定，只有卢辛达才能与之媲美。那女人长长的金色秀发不仅遮盖住了她的背部，而且遮盖了她全身；若不是下面还露出两只脚来，简直可以说她的身体的所有部分都看不见了。这时，她用手拢了拢头发。如果说她的两只脚像两块白玉，那么她的两只手就像两块密实的雪块。 三人见了都赞叹不已，而且更想知道她是谁了。 三人觉得该露面了。他们刚站起来，那漂亮的女子就抬起了头。她用双手拨开眼前的头发，看是什么东西发出了动静。她一看见三个人，就赶紧抓起身旁一包像是衣服的东西，慌慌张张地想要逃走。可是没跑出几步，她的细嫩双脚就再也受不了地上的乱石，跌倒在地。三个人见状来到她面前。神甫首先开口： “站住，姑娘，不管你是谁，我们都愿意为你效劳。你没有必要逃跑。你的脚受不了，我们也不会让你跑掉。” 姑娘惊慌失措，一言不发。三个人走过去。神甫拉着她的手，说道： “姑娘，你想用服装掩饰的东西，你的头发却把它暴露了。很明显，你如此漂亮，却打扮得如此不相称，来到如此偏僻的地方，原因一定非同小可。幸喜我们现在找到你了，即使不能帮你解决什么困难，至少可以给你一些忠告。人只要还活着，就不应该拒绝别人的善意劝告，任何困难也不会大到让人拒绝劝告的地步。因此，我的小姐或少爷，或者随便你愿意当什么吧，不要因为我们发现了你而吓得惊慌失措。给我们讲讲你的情况吧，不管它是好是坏，看看我们这几个人或者其中某个人是否能为你分担不幸。” 神甫说这番话的时候，那个乔装打扮的姑娘只是痴迷地看着他们，嘴唇不动，一句话也不说，仿佛一个乡下人突然见到一个从未见过的稀世之物一样。后来，神甫又讲了些同样内容的话，她才长长地吁了一口气，开口说道： “看来这荒山野岭并非我的藏身之地，这披散的头发也不再允许我说假话了。我现在再继续装下去已经毫无意义。如果你们相信我，我可以告诉你们，我这样做主要是出于礼貌，倒不是为了其它什么原因。诸位大人，我感谢你们愿意帮助我，也正因为如此，我应该满足你们的各种要求。不过我担心，我的不幸不仅会让你们对我产生同情，而且还会让你们感到难过，因为你们找不出什么办法可以帮助我，安慰我。尽管如此，为了不让你们对我的品行产生怀疑，我就把我本来想尽可能隐瞒的事情告诉你们吧。否则，你们已经认出我是女人，而且年纪轻轻，只身一人，又是这身打扮，无论是加起来还是仅只其中一项，都足以使我的名声扫地了。” 这个女人很美，说起话来滔滔不绝，而且语调轻柔，使三个人不仅欣赏她的美貌，而且对她的机敏赞叹不已。三个人再次表示愿意帮助她，并且再次请求她讲讲自己的事。那女人也不再推辞，大大方方地穿上鞋，把头发拢好，坐到一块石头上。等三个人在她周围坐好，她强忍住眼泪，声音平缓清晰地讲起了自己的不幸身世： “在安达卢西亚，有一块领地是一位公爵的，他在西班牙也称得上是个大人物了。公爵有两个儿子。大儿子继承了公爵的领地，似乎也继承了公爵的良好品行。小儿子继承了什么我不知道，反正贝利多的背信弃义和加拉隆的奸诈他都学会了。我的父母是公爵的臣民。父母虽然门第卑微，却很富裕。如果他们的门第能与他们的财产匹配，他们也就心满意足，我也不用害怕自己落到这种境地了。大概，我命运不佳就是因为我没有出生于豪门贵族吧。父母的门第既没有低贱到自惭卑微的地步，也没有高贵到让我否认我的不幸就是因为家世孤寒的程度。总之，他们是农夫，是平民，与那些臭名昭著的血统没有任何联系，就像人们常说的，是老基督徒了。他们生财有道，理财有方，逐渐获得了绅士的名声。不过，他们最大的财富就是有我这么个女儿。父母很喜欢我，而且只有我这么一个继承人，可以说我是个倍受父母宠爱的孩子。他们对我奉若神明，把我当成他们老年的依靠，凡事都同我商量，从我的需要出发，我总是能随心所欲。 “同时，我还是他们的的精神支柱，是他们的财富的管家。雇用和辞退佣人，播种和收割多少，都得经过我手。还有油磨、酒窖、大大小小的牲口和蜂箱都由我管。一句话，凡是一个像我父亲这样富有的农夫可能拥有和已经拥有的一切，都由我管。我成了女管家，女主人。我很愿意管，他们也很高兴让我管，愿意得没法再愿意了。我每天给领班、工头和佣人们派完活，就做些姑娘该做的事情，例如针线活、刺绣、纺织等等。有时候为了活跃一下精神生活，我还读点我喜欢的书，弹弹竖琴。根据我的体会，音乐可以调节紧张的精神生活，减轻人的精神负担。这就是我在我父母家里的生活。我特别提到这些并不是为了炫耀自己，或者让你们知道我是富人家的女儿，我只是想让你们知道，我从那样好的生活环境落到现在这种不幸的状况，责任全不在我。 “我就这样每天忙忙碌碌，而且深居简出，简直像个道士，我觉得除了家里的佣人，没有人能看见我。因为我去做弥撒的时候总是去得很早，而且有母亲和几个女佣陪伴，捂得严严实实，走路也规规矩矩，眼睛几乎只看脚下的那点地方。尽管如此，费尔南多爱情的眼睛，最好说是淫荡的眼睛，简直像猞猁一样敏锐，还是发现了我。这人就是我刚才说的那位公爵的小儿子。” 一听说费尔南多这个名字，卡德尼奥的脸骤然变色，并且开始冒汗。神甫和理发师都注意到了卡德尼奥脸上的变化，生怕他这时又犯起他们听说他常犯的疯病来。不过，卡德尼奥仅仅是脸上冒汗、目光呆滞而已。他紧紧盯着那个农家女，思索她究竟是谁。可那个姑娘并没有注意到卡德尼奥的这些变化，继续讲道： “他后来对我说，他还没认清我的模样就已坠入了情网，他后来的所作所为也证明了这点。不过为了尽快讲完我的故事，不过多地回溯我的不幸，我就别再讲费尔南多如何费尽心机，向我表示了他的心愿，他又如何买通了我家里所有的人，向我所有的亲戚送礼了吧。我家那时每天白天都热热闹闹，夜晚音乐搅得谁也睡不了觉。还有那些情书，简直不知是如何到我手里的，尽是没完没了的山盟海誓。他的这些做法不仅没有打动我，反而叫我心肠更硬了，仿佛他是我不共戴天的敌人。他搞这些动作，是为了实现他的目的，但结果恰恰相反。倒不是我觉得费尔南多风度不够，也不是觉得他殷勤过分了。被这样一位高贵的小伙子倾慕，我心里别提多高兴了。看到他那些情书上的满纸恭维，我并不觉得有什么不合适。在这方面，我觉得我们女人即使再丑，也愿意听别人说我们漂亮。只是我的品德和我父母对我的劝告让我对他的这些做法很反感。父母完全了解费尔南多的意图，因为他满不在乎地到处张扬。 “父母常常对我说，我的品行牵涉到他们的声誉，他们要我注意到我同费尔南多之间的差距。从这儿可以看出他们考虑的是他们的好恶，而不是我的利益。当然，这是另外一回事了。他们说，如果我愿意设法让他放弃其非分追求，他们愿意以后把我嫁给我喜欢的任何人，不管是我们那儿还是附近的大户人家。凭我家的财产和我的好名声，这是完全可以做到的。既然父母这样允诺我，又讲了这些道理，我自然坚守童贞，从没给费尔南多回过任何话，不让他以为有实现企图的希望，更何况这是根本不可能的。 “他大概把我的这种自重看成对他的蔑视了，也大概正因为如此，他的淫欲才更旺。我用这个词来形容他对我的追求。如果这是一种正当的追求，你们现在就不会知道这件事了，我也就没有机会给你们讲这件事了。总之，费尔南多知道了我父母正准备让我嫁人，让他死了这条心，至少知道我父母让我防着他。这个消息或猜疑使他做出一件事来。那是一个晚上，我正在自己的房间里，同我的一个侍女在一起。我把门锁好，以防万一有什么疏忽，我的名声会受到威胁。可不知是怎么回事，也想象不出到底是怎么回事，即使我这么小心防范，在那寂静的夜晚，他竟忽然出现在我眼前。他的目光使得我心慌意乱，眼前一片漆黑，舌头也不会动了。我没有力量喊叫，我觉得他也不会让我喊出来。他走到我面前，把我搂在怀里。我当时心慌意乱，已经无力保护自己。他开始跟我说话。我也不知道是怎么回事，他把谎话编得跟真话似的。 “那个背信弃义的家伙想用眼泪证实他的话，用叹息证明他的诚意。可怜的我孤陋寡闻，不善于应付这种情况，不知是怎么回事，竟开始以假当真了。不过，他并没有能通过怜悯、眼泪和叹息打动我。稍稍镇定之后，连我自己也没有想到，我会有那样的勇气对他说：‘大人，我现在就在你怀里，可我即使被一头野狮搂抱着，如果要我做出或说出损害我贞洁的事才肯放开我，无论是怎样做或怎样说，我都是不会答应的。所以，尽管你已经把我的身子搂在你怀里，我仍然坐怀不乱。如果你想强迫我再走下去，你就会看到你我的想法有多么不同。我是你的臣民，可不是你的奴隶。你的高贵的血统不能也不该让你有权力蔑视我的出身。你是主人，是贵族，应该受到尊重。我是农妇，是劳动者，也应该受到尊重。你的力气不会对我产生任何作用，你的财产在我眼里毫无价值，你的话骗不了我，你的眼泪和叹息也不会打动我的心。如果我刚才说的这些东西有一样出现在我父母同意他做我丈夫的那个人身上，而且他合我意，我顺他心，因为那是光明正大的，我即使没兴趣，也会心甘情愿地把你现在想强求的东西交给他。我的这些话就是想说明，除了我的合法丈夫，任何人也别想从我身上得到任何东西。’那个负心的贵族说：‘如果你考虑的仅仅是这个，美丽无比的多罗特亚（这是我这个不幸者的名字），我现在就和你拉手盟誓，让洞察一切的老天和这座圣母像作证。’” 卡德尼奥一听说她叫多罗特亚，又开始不安起来，他的猜测终于得到了证实。不过他并没有打断她的话，想看看事情的最后结局，其实，他对此几乎了如指掌。卡德尼奥说： “你叫多罗特亚，小姐？我也听说过一个同样的名字，而且她的遭遇也许和你差不多。请你继续讲下去，回头我再给你讲，肯定会让你既害怕又伤心。” 多罗特亚听到卡德尼奥的话，又见他破衣怪样，就说，如果他知道有关这个姑娘的事就请告诉她。假如命运还给她留下了一点好东西的话，那就是她有能够承受任何突如其来的灾难的勇气。她觉得自己经历过的痛苦已经到了无以复加的程度。 “如果事实真如我想象的那样，小姐，”卡德尼奥说，“我会把我想的这件事告诉你，不过下面还有机会，现在就说出来对你我都没必要。” “那就请便吧。”多罗特亚说，“我接着讲的就是费尔南多捧着我房间里的一座圣像，把它当作证婚物，信誓旦旦地说要做我的丈夫。不过他还没说完，我就告诉他，让他再好好考虑一下。还有，他父亲看到他娶了个自己管辖下的农家姑娘，一定会生气的，叫他不要为了我的容貌而冲动一时。因为这点并不足以让他为自己开脱。如果他出于对我的爱，真对我好，就应该尊重我的意志，尊重我的人格。不般配的婚姻并不幸福，而且很快就不会美好如初了。刚才说的这些话我都对他讲了，另外还说了许多话，我都忘记了。可是这些都未能让他放弃自己的企图，就好比一个人本来就不想付款，所以他签约时并无担心一样。 “这时候，我自言自语了几句：‘我肯定不会是第一个通过联姻爬到贵族地位的女人，费尔南多也不会是第一个被美貌或盲目的热情所驱使，结成了与自己贵族身份极不相称的姻缘的男人。如果命运给我提供了机会，我完全可以获得这个荣誉。即使他在实现了自己的目的之后，没有对我继续表现出他的热情，在上帝面前我还是他的妻子。假如我轻蔑地拒绝了他，最后他也会使用不应使用的手段，使用暴力，那样我还会丢人现眼，还得为我根本没有责任的罪孽替自己辩解。我怎么能让我的父母和其他人相信，这个男人是未经允许就进了我的房间呢？ “这些要求和后果我顷刻之间全都考虑过了，而且它们开始对我产生了作用，并最终导致了我的失身，连我自己也没想到会这样。费尔南多信誓旦旦，以圣母像为证，泪流满面，还有他的气质相貌，再加上各种真情的表示，完全可以俘虏一颗像我这样自由纯真的心灵。我叫来我的侍女，上有天，下有她为证，费尔南多再次重复了他的誓言。除了他刚刚说过的誓言，又补充了新的神圣誓言为证。他说如果不履行自己的诺言，将来会受到各种诅咒。他的眼睛里又噙满了泪水，叹息也更深重了。虽然我并不同意，可是他把我搂得更紧了。我的侍女后来又退出去了。最终我失去了童贞，然而他还是背叛了我。 “我没想到费尔南多让我遭到不幸的那个夜晚会那么快来临，而他在心满意足之后，最大的愿望却是避免让人们在那儿见到他。费尔南多急于离开我。原来是我的侍女设法把他带进来的，这时又是她在天亮之前把他带到了街上。他离开我的时候，虽然不再像来时那样急切了，但还是让我放心，说他一定会履行诺言。为了证实自己的话，他还掏出一个大戒指，套在我手上。 “他走了以后，我也不知道自己到底是喜还是忧。不过我可以说，我已心慌意乱，思绪万千，被这突如其来的事情弄得精神恍惚，没有勇气或者说没想起来同我的侍女争吵，责骂她竟敢背着我悄悄把费尔南多放进我的房间，因为已发生的事情究竟是好事还是坏事，我还没有拿准。临走时，我告诉费尔南多，他可以按照他那天晚上来的路线，以后晚上再来找我，因为我已经是他的人了，直到某一天他愿意把这件事公诸于众。但他只是第二天来了一次，以后一个多月，无论在街上还是在教堂，我都再也没有见过他。我苦苦寻找，因为我知道他就在镇上，而且常常去打猎。他很喜欢打猎。 “那些日子，我心里极度苦闷和害怕。我知道自己已经开始怀疑费尔南多了。我对侍女的胆大妄为也开始责怪，而在此之前，我并没有责骂过她。我知道自己是在强忍眼泪，强作欢颜，以免父母亲问我为什么不高兴，我还得编一番话应付他们。 “不过这些很快就结束了。如果一个人的尊严受到了损害，不再顾及面子，他就会失去耐心，让自己的内心思想昭然于天下。原来过了不久之后，我听说费尔南多在附近一个城市同一个品貌俱佳的姑娘结了婚。姑娘的父母有地位，但不很富裕，仅凭嫁妆是攀不上这门高亲的。听说她叫卢辛达，在他们的婚礼上还出了一些怪事。” 卡德尼奥一听到卢辛达的名字，就不由得耸起肩膀，咬紧嘴唇，蹙紧眉头，眼睛里差点流出眼泪来。不过，他还是听着多罗特亚继续讲下去： “我听到这个悲伤的消息后，并没有心寒，而是怒火中烧，差点儿跑到大街上去大叫大嚷，把他对我的背叛公之于众。后来我的愤怒又转化为一种新的想法，而且我当晚就付诸实施了。我穿上这身衣服，这是一个雇工给我的衣服，他是我父亲的佣人。我把我的不幸告诉了他，请他陪我到我的仇人所在的城市去。他先是对我的大胆设想大加指责，可是看到我主意已定，就同意陪我去，还说哪怕是陪我到天涯海角。后来，我在一个棉布枕套里藏了一身女装和一些珠宝与钱，以防万一，然后就在那个寂静的夜晚，背着那个背叛了我的侍女，同那个雇工一起出门上了路，脑子里乱哄哄的，心里想，事实既成已经无法改变了，不过我得让费尔南多跟我讲清楚他到底安的是什么心。 “我们走了两天半，到了我们要去的地方。一进城，我就打听卢辛达父母的家在哪儿。我刚问了一个人，他就告诉了我，而且比我想知道的还要多。他告诉了我卢辛达父母家的地址以及在卢辛达婚礼上发生的事情。这件事在城里已经众所周知，而且闹得沸沸扬扬。那人告诉我，费尔南多同卢辛达结婚的那天晚上，卢辛达说‘愿意’做费尔南多的妻子之后，就立刻晕了过去。她的丈夫解开她的胸衣，想让她透透气，结果发现了卢辛达亲手写的一张纸条，说她不能做费尔南多的妻子，因为她已经是卡德尼奥的人了。那人告诉我，说卡德尼奥是同一城市里的一位很有地位的青年。她说‘愿意’做费尔南多的妻子，只是不想违背父命。“反正纸条上的话让人觉得她准备一举行完结婚仪式就自杀，而且还讲了她为什么要结束自己的生命。后来，人们从她的衣服的不知什么地方找到了一把匕首，证明了纸条上说的那些话。费尔南多看到这些，觉得卢辛达嘲弄蔑视了他。卢辛达还没醒来，他就拿起从卢辛达身上发现的那把匕首向卢辛达刺去。若不是卢辛达的父母和其他在场的人拦住他，他就真的刺中卢辛达了。听说后来费尔南多就不见了，卢辛达第二天才醒过来，并且告诉父母，自己实际上是我刚才说的那个卡德尼奥的妻子。我还知道，举行婚礼仪式时卡德尼奥也在场。他看到卢辛达结了亲，这是他万万没有想到的。绝望之余，他离开了那座城市，临走前还留下一封信，信上说卢辛达伤害了他，还有他要到一个人们见不到他的地方去。 “这件事在城里已经家喻户晓，人们对此议论纷纷。后来听说卢辛达从父母家里出走了，满城都找不到她，人们议论得更厉害了。卢辛达的父母都快急疯了，不知道怎样才能找到她。我听到的这些话又重新给我带来了希望，觉得虽然没有找到费尔南多，也比找到一个结了婚的费尔南多好。我觉得事情还有挽回的余地，觉得大概是老天阻止他第二次成亲吧，让他认识到他应该对第一次成亲负责，让他知道他是个基督教徒，应该对社会习俗承担义务，更要对自己的灵魂承担义务。我还想入非非，用不存在的安慰来安慰自己，用一些渺茫黯淡的希望给自己已经厌倦了的生活增添乐趣。 “我虽然到了城里，却不知道该怎么办。还没找到费尔南多，我却听说有个公告，说谁若是能找到我，将得到重赏，并且公布了我的年龄和这身衣服的特征。人们以为我是被那个雇工从父母家拐走的，我从心底觉得这回丢尽了脸。我出走本来就够丢人的，现在又加上是私奔，本来很好的想法竟变成了这么卑贱的事情。我一听说公告的事，就带着那个雇工出了城。这时候，那个原来表示忠实于我的雇工也开始表现出犹豫了。那天晚上我们怕被人找到，就躲进了山上隐秘处。人们常说祸不单行，逃出狼窝又进了虎口，我就遇到了这种情况。那个雇工本来人挺好，忠实可靠，可现在他见我处于这种境地，竟趁机向我求欢。他不顾廉耻，无视上帝，不尊重我，并不是我的美貌刺激了他，而是他自己邪念横生。他见我严辞拒绝，便不再像原来打算的那样，靠软的得逞，而是开始对我来硬的。 “然而正义的老天很少或从来没有放弃主持正义。老天助我，尽管我力气小，却没费多少劲就把他推下了悬崖，也不知他最后是死还是活。然后，我又怕又累，赶紧跑到这山上，心里只想躲进山里，避免父亲和那些帮助他的人找到我。就这样我不知在山里过了几个月，后来碰到一个牧羊人，他把我带到这座山深处的一个地方给他帮忙。这段时间我一直给他放牧，为的是常待在野外，藏住我这长头发。没想到，这回暴露了。 “不过，我的用意和打算并没能起到什么作用。后来那个牧羊人发现我不是男人，就同我那个雇工一样产生了邪念。命运不会总是来帮助我，我也不是总能碰到悬崖，就像对我的雇工那样，把我的雇主推下去。最后我还是离开了他，再次藏进大山深处，免得同牧人较劲或求饶。我是说，我又重新隐藏起来，寻找一个可以毫无顾忌地叹息流泪，乞求老天同情我的不幸，指引我摆脱苦难的地方，不然就让我生活在这荒山野岭，让人们忘记这个被当地和外乡人无辜议论的可怜人吧。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4596.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
