{"id":42203,"no":63,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 9","content":"’Twas at the very midnight hour — more or less — when Don Quixote and Sancho quitted the wood and entered El Toboso. The town was in deep silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, though Sancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in the darkness an excuse for his blundering. All over the place nothing was to be heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of Don Quixote and troubled the heart of Sancho. Now and then an ass brayed, pigs grunted, cats mewed, and the various noises they made seemed louder in the silence of the night; all which the enamoured knight took to be of evil omen; nevertheless he said to Sancho, “Sancho, my son, lead on to the palace of Dulcinea, it may be that we shall find her awake.”\\n\\n “Body of the sun! what palace am I to lead to,” said Sancho, “when what I saw her highness in was only a very little house?”\\n\\n “Most likely she had then withdrawn into some small apartment of her palace,” said Don Quixote, “to amuse herself with damsels, as great ladies and princesses are accustomed to do.”\\n\\n “Senor,” said Sancho, “if your worship will have it in spite of me that the house of my lady Dulcinea is a palace, is this an hour, think you, to find the door open; and will it be right for us to go knocking till they hear us and open the door; making a disturbance and confusion all through the household? Are we going, do you fancy, to the house of our wenches, like gallants who come and knock and go in at any hour, however late it may be?”\\n\\n “Let us first of all find out the palace for certain,” replied Don Quixote, “and then I will tell thee, Sancho, what we had best do; but look, Sancho, for either I see badly, or that dark mass that one sees from here should be Dulcinea’s palace.”\\n\\n “Then let your worship lead the way,” said Sancho, “perhaps it may be so; though I see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, I’ll believe it as much as I believe it is daylight now.”\\n\\n Don Quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundred paces he came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was a great tower, and then he perceived that the building in question was no palace, but the chief church of the town, and said he, “It’s the church we have lit upon, Sancho.”\\n\\n “So I see,” said Sancho, “and God grant we may not light upon our graves; it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a graveyard at this time of night; and that, after my telling your worship, if I don’t mistake, that the house of this lady will be in an alley without an outlet.”\\n\\n “The curse of God on thee for a blockhead!” said Don Quixote; “where hast thou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being built in alleys without an outlet?”\\n\\n “Senor,” replied Sancho, “every country has a way of its own; perhaps here in El Toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand buildings in alleys; so I entreat your worship to let me search about among these streets or alleys before me, and perhaps, in some corner or other, I may stumble on this palace — and I wish I saw the dogs eating it for leading us such a dance.”\\n\\n “Speak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “let us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope after the bucket.”\\n\\n “I’ll hold my tongue,” said Sancho, “but how am I to take it patiently when your worship wants me, with only once seeing the house of our mistress, to know always, and find it in the middle of the night, when your worship can’t find it, who must have seen it thousands of times?”\\n\\n “Thou wilt drive me to desperation, Sancho,” said Don Quixote. “Look here, heretic, have I not told thee a thousand times that I have never once in my life seen the peerless Dulcinea or crossed the threshold of her palace, and that I am enamoured solely by hearsay and by the great reputation she bears for beauty and discretion?”\\n\\n “I hear it now,” returned Sancho; “and I may tell you that if you have not seen her, no more have I.”\\n\\n “That cannot be,” said Don Quixote, “for, at any rate, thou saidst, on bringing back the answer to the letter I sent by thee, that thou sawest her sifting wheat.”\\n\\n “Don’t mind that, senor,” said Sancho; “I must tell you that my seeing her and the answer I brought you back were by hearsay too, for I can no more tell who the lady Dulcinea is than I can hit the sky.”\\n\\n “Sancho, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “there are times for jests and times when jests are out of place; if I tell thee that I have neither seen nor spoken to the lady of my heart, it is no reason why thou shouldst say thou hast not spoken to her or seen her, when the contrary is the case, as thou well knowest.”\\n\\n While the two were engaged in this conversation, they perceived some one with a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood, and from the noise the plough made, as it dragged along the ground, they guessed him to be some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his work, and so it proved to be. He came along singing the ballad that says —\\n\\n Ill did ye fare, ye men of France, In Roncesvalles chase —\\n\\n “May I die, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, when he heard him, “if any good will come to us tonight! Dost thou not hear what that clown is singing?”\\n\\n “I do,” said Sancho, “but what has Roncesvalles chase to do with what we have in hand? He might just as well be singing the ballad of Calainos, for any good or ill that can come to us in our business.”\\n\\n By this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, “Can you tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is the palace of the peerless princess Dona Dulcinea del Toboso?”\\n\\n “Senor,” replied the lad, “I am a stranger, and I have been only a few days in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. In that house opposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, and both or either of them will be able to give your worship some account of this lady princess, for they have a list of all the people of El Toboso; though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the whole of it; many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house each of them may be a princess.”\\n\\n “Well, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,” said Don Quixote.\\n\\n “May be so,” replied the lad; “God be with you, for here comes the daylight;” and without waiting for any more of his questions, he whipped on his mules.\\n\\n Sancho, seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied, said to him, “Senor, daylight will be here before long, and it will not do for us to let the sun find us in the street; it will be better for us to quit the city, and for your worship to hide in some forest in the neighbourhood, and I will come back in the daytime, and I won’t leave a nook or corner of the whole village that I won’t search for the house, castle, or palace, of my lady, and it will be hard luck for me if I don’t find it; and as soon as I have found it I will speak to her grace, and tell her where and how your worship is waiting for her to arrange some plan for you to see her without any damage to her honour and reputation.”\\n\\n “Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thou hast delivered a thousand sentences condensed in the compass of a few words; I thank thee for the advice thou hast given me, and take it most gladly. Come, my son, let us go look for some place where I may hide, while thou dost return, as thou sayest, to seek, and speak with my lady, from whose discretion and courtesy I look for favours more than miraculous.”\\n\\n Sancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town, lest he should discover the falsehood of the reply he had brought to him in the Sierra Morena on behalf of Dulcinea; so he hastened their departure, which they took at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forest or thicket wherein Don Quixote ensconced himself, while Sancho returned to the city to speak to Dulcinea, in which embassy things befell him which demand fresh attention and a new chapter.\\n\\n \\n\\n 大约夜半三更时分，唐吉诃德和桑乔离开那几棵圣栎树，进了托博索城。万籁俱寂，居民们都已经入睡了，而且像人们常说的，睡得高枕无忧。夜色若明若暗，而桑乔希望夜色漆黑，那样他就可以为自己找不到地方开脱了。四周只能听到狗吠声，这吠声让唐吉诃德感到刺耳，让桑乔感到心烦。不时也传来驴嚎、猪哼和猫叫的声音。这些叫声在寂静的夜晚显得格外响亮，使得多情的唐吉诃德感到了一种不祥之兆。尽管如此，他还是对桑乔说：\\n\\n “可爱的桑乔，你快领我去杜尔西内亚的宫殿吧，大概她现在还没睡哩。”\\n\\n “领您去什么宫殿哟，我的老天！”桑乔说，“上次我去看她的时候，她住的不只是一间小房子吗？”\\n\\n “她当时一定是带着几个侍女在宫殿的某个小房间里休息，这是尊贵的夫人和公主的通常习惯。”\\n\\n “大人，”桑乔说，“您硬要把杜尔西内亚夫人的家说成是宫殿，我也没办法。可就算是那样，现在它难道还没锁门吗？咱们现在使劲叫门，把大家都叫醒了，合适吗？咱们能像到某个相好家去似的，不管什么时候，不管多晚，到了那儿就叫门，然后进去，那样行吗？”\\n\\n “咱们先到宫殿去，”唐吉诃德说，“到时我再告诉你咱们该怎么做。你看，桑乔，如果不是我看错了，前面那一大团黑影大概就是杜尔西内亚的宫殿映出来的。”\\n\\n “那就请您带路吧，”桑乔说，“也许真是这样。不过，即使我能用眼看到，用手摸到，要我相信那就是宫殿，简直是白日做梦！”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德在前面引路，走了大约两百步，来到那团阴影前，才看清那是一座塔状建筑物，后来弄清了那并不是什么宫殿，而是当地的一个大教堂。唐吉诃德说：\\n\\n “这是一座教堂，桑乔。”\\n\\n “我已经看见了，”桑乔说，“上帝保佑，别让咱们走到墓地去。这时候闯进墓地可不是件好事。如果我没记错的话，您说过这位夫人的家是在一条死胡同里。”\\n\\n “真见鬼了，你这个笨蛋！”唐吉诃德说，“你什么时候见过建在死胡同里的宫殿？”\\n\\n “大人，”桑乔说，“每个时期都有各自不同的习惯。也许在托博索，就是把宫殿和高大建筑物建在死胡同里。现在，我请求您让我在这大街小巷到处找一找，也许在哪个旮旯里能找到那个宫殿呢。这个该死的宫殿，害得咱们到处乱找！”\\n\\n “谈到我的夫人时，你说话得有点礼貌，桑乔。”唐吉诃德说，“咱们就此打住吧，免得伤了和气又办不成事。”\\n\\n “我会克制自己的，”桑乔说，“不过我只来过一次女主人的家，您就要我务必认出来，而且是在半夜三更找到它，而您大概来过几千次了，居然也找不到，您还要让我怎样耐心呢？”\\n\\n “我真拿你没办法。”唐吉诃德说，“过来，你这个混蛋！我不是跟你说过上千次，我这辈子从没见过举世无双的杜尔西内亚，也从没跨进她的宫殿的门槛，只是听说她既美丽又聪明才恋上了她吗？”\\n\\n “那我告诉您，”桑乔说，“既然您没见过她，我也没见过。”\\n\\n “这不可能，”唐吉诃德说，“至少你对我说过，你替我捎信又为我带来回信，曾见过她正在簸麦子。”\\n\\n “您别太认真了，大人。”桑乔说，“我可以告诉您，那次说我看见她以及我给您带了回信，也都是听说的。要说我知道谁是杜尔西内亚夫人，那简直是让太阳从西边出来。”\\n\\n “桑乔啊桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“玩笑有时候可以开，但有些时候就不该再开玩笑了。不要因为我说我从没和我的心上人见过面，说过话，你也就不顾事实，说你没见过她，没有同她说过话嘛。”\\n\\n 两人正说着话，迎面走来了一个人，还赶着两匹骡子，并且有犁拖在地上的响声。估计是个农夫，一大早起来到地里去干活。实际情况也的确如此。农夫边走边唱着歌谣：\\n\\n 在龙塞斯瓦列斯山，\\n\\n 法兰西人遇到了不幸。\\n\\n “真要命，桑乔，”唐吉诃德听到这句歌谣说道，“咱们今天晚上不会碰到什么好事。你没听到那个乡巴佬唱什么吗？”\\n\\n “听是听到了，”桑乔说，“可是，龙塞斯瓦列斯山的事情与咱们有什么相干？他还可以唱卡莱诺的歌谣呢，这对咱们的事好坏并没有什么影响。”\\n\\n 此时农夫已经来到他们面前。唐吉诃德向农夫问道：\\n\\n “好朋友，上帝会给你带来好运。你是否知道，天下无与伦比的托博索的杜尔西内亚公主的宫殿在哪儿？”\\n\\n “大人，”那个农夫说，“我是外地人，几天前才来到这个地方为一个富农干农活。他家对面住着当地的神甫和教堂管事。他们或他们当中的某个人或许清楚那位公主的事情，因为他们掌管着托博索所有居民的花名册呢。不过据我所知，在整个托博索并没有什么公主，贵小姐倒是有不少，每一个在家里都可以称得上是公主。”\\n\\n “朋友，在那些人里大概就有我要找的那位公主。”唐吉诃德说。\\n\\n “很可能，”农夫说，“那就再见吧，天快亮了。”\\n\\n 不等唐吉诃德再问什么，农夫就赶着骡子走了。桑乔见主人还呆在那里，一脸不高兴的样子，就对他说：\\n\\n “大人，天快亮了。白天让人在街上看到咱们多不好。最好是咱们先出城去，您先藏在附近的某个小树林里，天亮以后我再回来找咱们这位夫人的房子或宫殿。如果找不到，算我倒霉；如果找到了，我就告诉您。我还会告诉她，您待在什么地方，正等待她的吩咐，好安排您去见她。这对她的名声并没有什么影响。”\\n\\n “你这几句话可以说是言简意切，桑乔。”唐吉诃德说，“你的话正中我下怀，我非常愿意听。过来，伙计，咱们去找个地方，我先藏起来。你就像你说的那样，再回来寻找，看望和问候我的夫人。她聪明文雅肯定超出了我的意料。”\\n\\n 桑乔急于让唐吉诃德走开，以免他发现自己胡诌杜尔西内亚曾带信到莫雷纳山的谎话。因此他们赶紧离开，来到离城两西里远的一片树林里。唐吉诃德藏起来，桑乔又返回城里去找杜尔西内亚。此后，又发生了一些值得注意的事。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4630.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
