{"id":42212,"no":72,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 18","content":"Don Quixote found Don Diego de Miranda’s house built in village style, with his arms in rough stone over the street door; in the patio was the store-room, and at the entrance the cellar, with plenty of wine-jars standing round, which, coming from El Toboso, brought back to his memory his enchanted and transformed Dulcinea; and with a sigh, and not thinking of what he was saying, or in whose presence he was, he exclaimed — “O ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found! Once sweet and welcome when ’twas heaven’s good-will. O ye Tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the sweet object of my bitter regrets!” The student poet, Don Diego’s son, who had come out with his mother to receive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son were filled with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he, however, dismounting from Rocinante, advanced with great politeness to ask permission to kiss the lady’s hand, while Don Diego said, “Senora, pray receive with your wonted kindness Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, whom you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest in the world.” The lady, whose name was Dona Christina, received him with every sign of good-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at her service with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases. Almost the same civilities were exchanged between him and the student, who listening to Don Quixote, took him to be a sensible, clear-headed person. Here the author describes minutely everything belonging to Don Diego’s mansion, putting before us in his picture the whole contents of a rich gentleman-farmer’s house; but the translator of the history thought it best to pass over these and other details of the same sort in silence, as they are not in harmony with the main purpose of the story, the strong point of which is truth rather than dull digressions. They led Don Quixote into a room, and Sancho removed his armour, leaving him in loose Walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet, all stained with the rust of his armour; his collar was a falling one of scholastic cut, without starch or lace, his buskins buff-coloured, and his shoes polished. He wore his good sword, which hung in a baldric of sea-wolf’s skin, for he had suffered for many years, they say, from an ailment of the kidneys; and over all he threw a long cloak of good grey cloth. But first of all, with five or six buckets of water (for as regard the number of buckets there is some dispute), he washed his head and face, and still the water remained whey-coloured, thanks to Sancho’s greediness and purchase of those unlucky curds that turned his master so white. Thus arrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallant air, Don Quixote passed out into another room, where the student was waiting to entertain him while the table was being laid; for on the arrival of so distinguished a guest, Dona Christina was anxious to show that she knew how and was able to give a becoming reception to those who came to her house. While Don Quixote was taking off his armour, Don Lorenzo (for so Don Diego’s son was called) took the opportunity to say to his father, “What are we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us, sir? For his name, his appearance, and your describing him as a knight-errant have completely puzzled my mother and me.” “I don’t know what to say, my son,” replied. Don Diego; “all I can tell thee is that I have seen him act the acts of the greatest madman in the world, and heard him make observations so sensible that they efface and undo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits, and as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst as to his wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, I am more inclined to take him to be mad than sane.” With this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been said, and in the course of the conversation that passed between them Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, “Your father, Senor Don Diego de Miranda, has told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you possess, and, above all, that you are a great poet.” “A poet, it may be,” replied Don Lorenzo, “but a great one, by no means. It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to reading good poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of ‘great’ which my father gives me.” “I do not dislike that modesty,” said Don Quixote; “for there is no poet who is not conceited and does not think he is the best poet in the world.” “There is no rule without an exception,” said Don Lorenzo; “there may be some who are poets and yet do not think they are.” “Very few,” said Don Quixote; “but tell me, what verses are those which you have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhat restless and absorbed? If it be some gloss, I know something about glosses, and I should like to hear them; and if they are for a poetical tournament, contrive to carry off the second prize; for the first always goes by favour or personal standing, the second by simple justice; and so the third comes to be the second, and the first, reckoning in this way, will be third, in the same way as licentiate degrees are conferred at the universities; but, for all that, the title of first is a great distinction.” “So far,” said Don Lorenzo to himself, “I should not take you to be a madman; but let us go on.” So he said to him, “Your worship has apparently attended the schools; what sciences have you studied?” “That of knight-errantry,” said Don Quixote, “which is as good as that of poetry, and even a finger or two above it.” “I do not know what science that is,” said Don Lorenzo, “and until now I have never heard of it.” “It is a science,” said Don Quixote, “that comprehends in itself all or most of the sciences in the world, for he who professes it must be a jurist, and must know the rules of justice, distributive and equitable, so as to give to each one what belongs to him and is due to him. He must be a theologian, so as to be able to give a clear and distinctive reason for the Christian faith he professes, wherever it may be asked of him. He must be a physician, and above all a herbalist, so as in wastes and solitudes to know the herbs that have the property of healing wounds, for a knight-errant must not go looking for some one to cure him at every step. He must be an astronomer, so as to know by the stars how many hours of the night have passed, and what clime and quarter of the world he is in. He must know mathematics, for at every turn some occasion for them will present itself to him; and, putting it aside that he must be adorned with all the virtues, cardinal and theological, to come down to minor particulars, he must, I say, be able to swim as well as Nicholas or Nicolao the Fish could, as the story goes; he must know how to shoe a horse, and repair his saddle and bridle; and, to return to higher matters, he must be faithful to God and to his lady; he must be pure in thought, decorous in words, generous in works, valiant in deeds, patient in suffering, compassionate towards the needy, and, lastly, an upholder of the truth though its defence should cost him his life. Of all these qualities, great and small, is a true knight-errant made up; judge then, Senor Don Lorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science which the knight who studies and professes it has to learn, and whether it may not compare with the very loftiest that are taught in the schools.” “If that be so,” replied Don Lorenzo, “this science, I protest, surpasses all.” “How, if that be so?” said Don Quixote. “What I mean to say,” said Don Lorenzo, “is, that I doubt whether there are now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adorned with such virtues.” “Many a time,” replied Don Quixote, “have I said what I now say once more, that the majority of the world are of opinion that there never were any knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that, unless heaven by some miracle brings home to them the truth that there were and are, all the pains one takes will be in vain (as experience has often proved to me), I will not now stop to disabuse you of the error you share with the multitude. All I shall do is to pray to heaven to deliver you from it, and show you how beneficial and necessary knights-errant were in days of yore, and how useful they would be in these days were they but in vogue; but now, for the sins of the people, sloth and indolence, gluttony and luxury are triumphant.” “Our guest has broken out on our hands,” said Don Lorenzo to himself at this point; “but, for all that, he is a glorious madman, and I should be a dull blockhead to doubt it.” Here, being summoned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close. Don Diego asked his son what he had been able to make out as to the wits of their guest. To which he replied, “All the doctors and clever scribes in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness; he is a madman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals.” They went in to dinner, and the repast was such as Don Diego said on the road he was in the habit of giving to his guests, neat, plentiful, and tasty; but what pleased Don Quixote most was the marvellous silence that reigned throughout the house, for it was like a Carthusian monastery. When the cloth had been removed, grace said and their hands washed, Don Quixote earnestly pressed Don Lorenzo to repeat to him his verses for the poetical tournament, to which he replied, “Not to be like those poets who, when they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and when they are not asked for them vomit them up, I will repeat my gloss, for which I do not expect any prize, having composed it merely as an exercise of ingenuity.” “A discerning friend of mine,” said Don Quixote, “was of opinion that no one ought to waste labour in glossing verses; and the reason he gave was that the gloss can never come up to the text, and that often or most frequently it wanders away from the meaning and purpose aimed at in the glossed lines; and besides, that the laws of the gloss were too strict, as they did not allow interrogations, nor ‘said he,’ nor ‘I say,’ nor turning verbs into nouns, or altering the construction, not to speak of other restrictions and limitations that fetter gloss-writers, as you no doubt know.” “Verily, Senor Don Quixote,” said Don Lorenzo, “I wish I could catch your worship tripping at a stretch, but I cannot, for you slip through my fingers like an eel.” “I don’t understand what you say, or mean by slipping,” said Don Quixote. “I will explain myself another time,” said Don Lorenzo; “for the present pray attend to the glossed verses and the gloss, which run thus: Could ‘was’ become an ‘is’ for me, Then would I ask no more than this; Or could, for me, the time that is Become the time that is to be! — To me was bountiful and kind; But all things change; she changed her mind, And what she gave she took away. O Fortune, long I’ve sued to thee; The gifts thou gavest me restore, For, trust me, I would ask no more, Could ‘was’ become an ‘is’ for me. No other prize I seek to gain, No triumph, glory, or success, Only the long-lost happiness, The memory whereof is pain. One taste, methinks, of bygone bliss The heart-consuming fire might stay; And, so it come without delay, Then would I ask no more than this. I ask what cannot be, alas! That time should ever be, and then Come back to us, and be again, No power on earth can bring to pass; For fleet of foot is he, I wis, And idly, therefore, do we pray That what for aye hath left us may Become for us the time that is. Perplexed, uncertain, to remain ‘Twixt hope and fear, is death, not life; ’Twere better, sure, to end the strife, And dying, seek release from pain. And yet, thought were the best for me. Anon the thought aside I fling, And to the present fondly cling, And dread the time that is to be.” When Don Lorenzo had finished reciting his gloss, Don Quixote stood up, and in a loud voice, almost a shout, exclaimed as he grasped Don Lorenzo’s right hand in his, “By the highest heavens, noble youth, but you are the best poet on earth, and deserve to be crowned with laurel, not by Cyprus or by Gaeta — as a certain poet, God forgive him, said — but by the Academies of Athens, if they still flourished, and by those that flourish now, Paris, Bologna, Salamanca. Heaven grant that the judges who rob you of the first prize — that Phoebus may pierce them with his arrows, and the Muses never cross the thresholds of their doors. Repeat me some of your long-measure verses, senor, if you will be so good, for I want thoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius.” Is there any need to say that Don Lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself praised by Don Quixote, albeit he looked upon him as a madman? power of flattery, how far-reaching art thou, and how wide are the bounds of thy pleasant jurisdiction! Don Lorenzo gave a proof of it, for he complied with Don Quixote’s request and entreaty, and repeated to him this sonnet on the fable or story of Pyramus and Thisbe. Heart-pierced by her young Pyramus doth lie; And Love spreads wing from Cyprus isle to fly, A chink to view so wondrous great and small. There silence speaketh, for no voice at all Can pass so strait a strait; but love will ply Where to all other power ’twere vain to try; For love will find a way whate’er befall. Impatient of delay, with reckless pace The rash maid wins the fatal spot where she Sinks not in lover’s arms but death’s embrace. So runs the strange tale, how the lovers twain One sword, one sepulchre, one memory, Slays, and entombs, and brings to life again. “Blessed be God,” said Don Quixote when he had heard Don Lorenzo’s sonnet, “that among the hosts there are of irritable poets I have found one consummate one, which, senor, the art of this sonnet proves to me that you are!” For four days was Don Quixote most sumptuously entertained in Don Diego’s house, at the end of which time he asked his permission to depart, telling him he thanked him for the kindness and hospitality he had received in his house, but that, as it did not become knights-errant to give themselves up for long to idleness and luxury, he was anxious to fulfill the duties of his calling in seeking adventures, of which he was informed there was an abundance in that neighbourhood, where he hoped to employ his time until the day came round for the jousts at Saragossa, for that was his proper destination; and that, first of all, he meant to enter the cave of Montesinos, of which so many marvellous things were reported all through the country, and at the same time to investigate and explore the origin and true source of the seven lakes commonly called the lakes of Ruidera. Don Diego and his son commended his laudable resolution, and bade him furnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings, as they would most gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, his personal worth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them. The day of his departure came at length, as welcome to Don Quixote as it was sad and sorrowful to Sancho Panza, who was very well satisfied with the abundance of Don Diego’s house, and objected to return to the starvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his ill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what he considered needful. On taking leave, Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, “I know not whether I have told you already, but if I have I tell you once more, that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in reaching the inaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you have nothing to do but to turn aside out of the somewhat narrow path of poetry and take the still narrower one of knight-errantry, wide enough, however, to make you an emperor in the twinkling of an eye.” In this speech Don Quixote wound up the evidence of his madness, but still better in what he added when he said, “God knows, I would gladly take Don Lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humble, and trample the proud under foot, virtues that are part and parcel of the profession I belong to; but since his tender age does not allow of it, nor his praiseworthy pursuits permit it, I will simply content myself with impressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as a poet if you are guided by the opinion of others rather than by your own; because no fathers or mothers ever think their own children ill-favoured, and this sort of deception prevails still more strongly in the case of the children of the brain.” Both father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley Don Quixote talked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at the pertinacity and persistence he displayed in going through thick and thin in quest of his unlucky adventures, which he made the end and aim of his desires. There was a renewal of offers of service and civilities, and then, with the gracious permission of the lady of the castle, they took their departure, Don Quixote on Rocinante, and Sancho on Dapple. 唐吉诃德发现迭戈的家大得简直就像一座村庄。临街的大门上方有标牌，尽管那是用粗石做的。院子里有酒窖，门廊处有地窖。许许多多的产于托博索的酒坛子又使唐吉诃德怀念起已被魔法改变了模样的杜尔西内亚来。他长叹一声，也不看旁边有什么人，就情不自禁地说道： “为我受苦的心上人呀， 上帝会让你如意称心。 托博索的酒坛啊，你勾起了我对那位使我万分痛苦的心上人的甜蜜回忆！” 迭戈的那位大学生兼诗人的儿子闻声同母亲一起出来迎接唐吉诃德。他们一看到唐吉诃德的奇怪装束都愣住了。唐吉诃德下了马，十分有礼貌地请求吻女主人的手。迭戈对他夫人说： “夫人，请你以非常的热情接待你面前这位曼查的唐吉诃德大人吧，他是世界上最勇敢最聪明的游侠骑士。” 迭戈的夫人唐娜克里斯蒂娜非常热情又非常有礼貌地接待唐吉诃德，唐吉诃德也非常客气地答之以礼。对那个大学生，唐吉诃德也同样寒暄了一番。那个学生根据唐吉诃德的言谈判断，觉得他是一个很机敏的人。 原作者介绍了迭戈家的各种情况，把乡间富裕农户的东西叙述了一遍。可是译者却认为，这些琐屑小事与这部小说的主题无关，就把这些描写全都删去了。他觉得事实比那些干巴巴的细节更有说服力。 唐吉诃德走进客厅，桑乔帮他脱掉甲胄。唐吉诃德只穿着短裤子、羊皮坎肩，衬衣是学生式的大翻领，既没上浆，也没镶花边；脚上穿的是浅黄色的软靴，外面是打了蜡的硬皮鞋，浑身上下都蹭满了盔甲的铁锈。他把剑挂在一条海豹皮宽背带上，据说这是因为他的肾有病已经多年，身上披着一件上等呢料的棕褐色短外套。他首先要了五六桶水冲洗脸和头。各桶的水量不一，可是全都洗完，水还是乳白色的。这都是馋嘴的桑乔造成的。他买的破奶酪把主人弄白了。经过一番打扮，唐吉诃德风度翩翩地走出来，来到另一个房间。那位大学生正在那儿等着他，准备趁着备饭的时候同他随便聊聊。唐娜克里斯蒂娜夫人因有贵客光临，想利用这个机会表现一下，证明自己能够而且善于款待来到她家的客人。 迭戈的儿子叫洛伦索。唐吉诃德刚才脱盔甲的时候，他就问父亲： “父亲，您带到咱们家来的这个人是干什么的？他的名字，他的打扮，还有他说自己是游侠骑士，使我和母亲都感到很奇怪。” “我也不知道该怎么对你说才好，孩子。”迭戈说，“我只能对你说，我看见他做了一些世界上最荒谬的事情，可又说了一些聪明绝伦的话，把他的荒谬举动抵消了。你去同他聊聊吧，根据他的谈吐猜测一下他到底是什么样的人。你是个聪明人，他到底是机智过头还是愚蠢透顶，你按照情理自己判断吧。不过说实话，我倒宁愿把他看成是疯子，而不是正常人。” 就这样，洛伦索去找唐吉诃德了。谈话中，唐吉诃德对洛伦索说道： “您的父亲迭戈·德米兰达对我谈过您的超群的智慧，而且特别提到您是个伟大的诗人。” “诗人，我也许算得上，”洛伦索说，“可要说是伟大的诗人，那我就不敢当了。我的确是个诗歌爱好者，并且喜欢读一些优秀诗人的作品，但绝对够不上我父亲所说的伟大的诗人。” “我觉得你如此谦虚很不错，”唐吉诃德说，“因为现在的诗人都很狂妄，都自以为是世界上最伟大的诗人。” “凡事都有例外，”洛伦索说，“也许有的人就不是这样，就不这么想。” “这种人很少，”唐吉诃德说，“不过请您告诉我，您现在正写什么诗，竟使得您的父亲有些忧虑不安？如果是敷衍体诗，我略知一二，很希望拜读您的作品。如果这诗是为诗歌比赛准备的，我劝您争取二等奖，因为一等奖往往要照顾人情或是为贵人准备的。二等奖才货真价实。三等奖等于二等奖，以此类推，一等奖就等于三等奖，这就同大学里授学位一样。不过尽管如此，号称‘第一名’的人毕竟是最露脸的。” “直到现在，我还不能说他是疯子，”洛伦索心里说，“让我再接着同他聊。” 于是，他对唐吉诃德说： “我觉得您在学校里上过学。您学的是什么专业？” “游侠骑士专业。”唐吉诃德说，“我觉得它像诗歌一样优美。若说它超过了诗歌，也只是超出了那么一点儿。” “我不知道那是什么专业，”洛伦索说，“我还从来没听说过。” “这是一门包括了世界上所有专业或大部分专业的专业。”唐吉诃德说，“因为从事这项专业的人得是法学家，懂得奖惩分明，使每个人都可以得到他应该得到的东西；他应该是神学家，若有人来向他请教，他可以明确地讲解他所信奉的基督教教义；他应该是医生，尤其应该是草药专家，能够识别荒山野岭中可以治伤的药草，免得游侠骑士到处去寻找治伤的药；他应该是天文学家，能够通过观察星星知道已经是深夜几时，知道自己所处的方位和气候带；他应该懂得数学，这门学问每时每刻都会用得上；除此之外，他还应该具有宗教道德和其他各种基本道德。接下来，他还得会其他一些小事情，例如，他应该像尼古拉斯或尼科劳人鱼①那样善于游泳，能够钉马掌，或修理马鞍和马嚼子。再回到刚才的话题上，他应该忠实于上帝和他的意中人，应该思想纯洁，谈吐文明，举止大方，行动果敢，吃苦耐劳，同情弱者，最多于生活在陆地的时间，并且频频在西西里和陆地之间往返穿梭。主要的就是坚持真理，为了保卫真理，即使牺牲自己的生命也在所不惜。这许多大大小小方面的才能构成了一个优秀的游侠骑士。这回您该知道了，洛伦索大人，骑士的学问难道是一门粗浅的学问吗？难道不能同学校和课堂里最高深的学问相比吗？” ①15世纪意大利的卡塔尼亚人，善于游泳。 “如果真是这样，”洛伦索说，“我承认它是一门超越了其他所有学科的学问。” “什么叫‘如果真是这样’？”唐吉诃德说。 “我是说，”洛伦索说，“我怀疑世界上过去和现在真有具备了如此才能的游侠骑士。” “这个问题我已经说过多次了，现在我又得重复。”唐吉诃德说，“那就是大部分人认为世界上不曾有过游侠骑士。依我看，只有老天创造出奇迹，他们才会相信无论过去还是现在都确实存在着游侠骑士，否则我再费力气解释也是徒劳。在这方面我已有多次的经验了。现在，我并不想让您摆脱多数人曾经重复的错误，只是想恳求老天让您醒悟，让您明白，在过去的世纪里，游侠骑士对于世界来说是多么有益必要，而当今之世如果风行游侠骑士又有多少好处。可是现在，由于人本身的罪恶，却是贪图安逸和追求享乐占了上风。” “这回我们这位客人可露馅了。”洛伦索心中暗想，“不过，他毕竟是个非常特殊的疯子。如果我没有认识到这点，那么我就太笨了。” 因为叫他们去吃饭了，他们的谈话到此为止。迭戈问儿子对这位客人印象如何，儿子答道： “要想治好他的疯病，恐怕世界上所有的医生都无能为力，看来只有靠那些摇笔杆子的人了。” 大家去吃饭了。招待客人的饭食果然像迭戈在路上说的那样：干净、丰盛、鲜美。不过，最令唐吉诃德感到满意的是整个家庭像苦修会的修道院一般幽静。饭罢，大家撤掉台布，向上帝致谢，又用水洗洗手。唐吉诃德恳求洛伦索把他准备参加诗歌比赛的诗拿来给自己看。洛伦索说： “有的诗人在人家请他念自己的诗时，他拒绝；可人家没请他念的时候，他却又自作多情。为了不让你们以为我也是那种人，我就念念我的敷衍诗吧。不过，我并没有指望它得什么奖，只是为了锻炼一下我的智力。” “我的一位朋友，一位非常明智的人，”唐吉诃德说，“认为不应该给人家念敷衍诗，让人家厌烦。他说理由就是敷衍诗从来都不能表现原文的含义，往往超越了原诗的范围，而且敷衍诗本身的范围也特别窄，不准用问句，不能用‘他曾说’、‘他将说’，不能用动名词，不能改变含义，还有其他一些清规戒律，都束缚了敷衍诗。对于这些，大概您也有所了解。” “唐吉诃德大人，”洛伦索说，“我存心想找出您的破绽，可是没找到，您像泥鳅一样从我手里溜掉了。” “我不明白您说的‘溜掉了’是什么意思。”唐吉诃德说。 “以后我会让您明白的。”洛伦索说，“不过，现在您先听听原诗，再听听根据它写的敷衍诗吧。”原诗是这样写的： 假如今能比昔， 明日等待何须。 让时光倒流， 或让未来现在达抵。 敷　衍　诗 如同一切都会发生， 我的幸福已成陈迹。 那曾经不浅的幸运 一去不复返， 无影无息。 命运之神， 你已见到我 在你脚下拜倒了几个世纪。 让我重新成为幸运者吧， 我又会春风得意， “假如今能比昔”。 我并不贪求其他乐趣与荣耀， 其他的掌声和欢呼， 其他的成功和胜利。 只求得到往日的欢乐， 它现在却是痛苦的回忆。 如果你能让我回到往昔， 命运之神， 我所忍受的煎熬将会更替。 如果这一幸运能立刻实现， “明日等待何须”。 我的追求绝非可能。 事过境迁， 却要时光倒转， 世上从未有过如此回天之力。 时间飞逝， 永不回头。 光阴一去不还， 追求者必失败， 除非“让时光倒流”。 生活在彷徨中， 希冀又恐惧， 虽生犹死， 不如为超脱痛苦 毅然决然地死去。 我愿一死了之， 可事情未如我意。 斗转星移， 生活还会让我恐惧， “或让未来现在达抵”。 洛伦索刚念完，唐吉诃德就站起来，拉住洛伦索的右手，声音高得几乎像喊叫，说道： “老天万岁！出类拔萃的小伙子，你是世界上最伟大的诗人，你应该得到桂冠，但不是在塞浦路斯或加埃塔，就像一位诗人说的那样，而是在雅典科学院，上帝饶恕我吧，假如这些学院现在还存在的话；或者，是在现存的巴黎、波洛尼亚和萨拉曼卡科学院！上帝保佑，评审委员们若是不给你一等奖，就让福玻斯①用箭射死他们，就让缪斯永远不进他们家的门槛！大人，如果您能赏光的话，就请再给我念几首更高级的诗吧，我想全面领教一下您的惊人的才华。” 尽管洛伦索把唐吉诃德看成是疯子，这时听到唐吉诃德的赞扬，还是很高兴，这难道不是好事吗？恭维的力量，你真是无处不及，力大无边啊！洛伦索就证明了这个事实。他满足了唐吉诃德的要求和愿望，念了一首根据皮拉摩斯和提斯柏的传说写的十四行诗： 十　四　行　诗 美丽的少女凿开了墙壁， 也打开了英俊的皮拉摩斯的胸臆， 阿摩尔②从塞浦路斯赶来， 观看这窄小神奇的孔隙。 相对无言，默默无语， 唯恐声音穿过这狭小的罅缝； 但两相情愿，两心相通， 爱情面前无阻力。 事出预料，情非人意， 少女误走一步，导致香消玉陨。 噢，如此奇妙的悲剧。 同一把剑，他们被掩杀又复生， 留下了一个墓穴，一场回忆。 ①太阳神阿波罗的别名之一。 ②阿摩尔又称厄罗斯，是希腊传说中的小爱神。 “感谢上帝，”唐吉诃德听洛伦索念完诗后说，“在当今无数蹩脚的诗人中，我终于发现了像您这样完美的诗人。这首十四行诗的高超技巧就向我证明了这一点。” 唐吉诃德在洛伦索家住了四天，受到了极其盛情的款待。四天后，唐吉诃德向主人告别，对在主人家受到很好的照顾表示感谢。但是作为游侠骑士，过多地贪图安逸就不合适了。他还要去履行他的职责，征服险恶，他听说这种险恶在当地还有很多。他打算就近转悠几天，等到了萨拉戈萨大比武的日子再到萨拉戈萨去。反正他是要去那儿的。不过，他首先得到蒙特西诺斯山洞去。据说那里有很多奇怪的事情，他想去看看。另外，他还想去看看人称“鲁伊德拉七湖”的发源地和它真正的水流走向。迭戈和他的儿子对唐吉诃德的光荣决定大加赞赏，告诉他，家里有什么他认为可能用得着的东西，尽可拿走，对于从事这种高尚职业的好人理应如此。 出发的日子终于到了。唐吉诃德兴高采烈，桑乔却垂头丧气。他对在迭戈家酒足饭饱的日子非常满意，不愿意再到荒郊野林去吃褡裢里那点干粮了。尽管如此，他还是用褡裢装上了足够的食物。唐吉诃德临行前对洛伦索说： “我不知道是否已经对您说过，如果我已经说过了，那我就再说一遍：如果您想走捷径，少费力气，达到那难以抵达的法玛①的顶峰，您不用做别的，只需部分地放弃那略显狭窄的诗歌创作之路，而选择更为狭窄的游侠骑士之路。游侠骑士不费吹灰之力就可以成为皇帝。” ①罗马人对希腊神话中的女神俄萨的称呼。法玛本身是“名望”的意思。 唐吉诃德又说了一些疯话，才结束了他的疯癫过程。他说道： “上帝知道，我本想带洛伦索大人同我一起走，以便教教他该怎样宽恕普通人，打掉狂妄人的威风，这是从事我们这行的人必不可少的品德。不过您年纪轻轻，而且还从事了这个值得赞颂的行当，所以我不能把您带走。我只想告诫您，作为诗人，您应该更多地采纳别人的意见，而不要只是按照自己的意见行事，那才能一举成名。世界上没有哪个父母认为自己的孩子丑；而在意识方面，这种自欺欺人的情况就更为严重。” 迭戈父子俩对唐吉诃德一会儿明白、一会儿糊涂的言语甚感惊讶。唐吉诃德翻来覆去地说，无非就是要去寻求他那倒霉的艰险，这才是他的最终目的。父子二人又客气了一番，女主人也依依惜别，唐吉诃德和桑乔分别骑着罗西南多和驴出发了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4639.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
