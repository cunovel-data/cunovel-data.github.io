{"id":42259,"no":119,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 65","content":"Don Antonia Moreno followed the Knight of the White Moon, and a number of boys followed him too, nay pursued him, until they had him fairly housed in a hostel in the heart of the city. Don Antonio, eager to make his acquaintance, entered also; a squire came out to meet him and remove his armour, and he shut himself into a lower room, still attended by Don Antonio, whose bread would not bake until he had found out who he was. He of the White Moon, seeing then that the gentleman would not leave him, said, “I know very well, senor, what you have come for; it is to find out who I am; and as there is no reason why I should conceal it from you, while my servant here is taking off my armour I will tell you the true state of the case, without leaving out anything. You must know, senor, that I am called the bachelor Samson Carrasco. I am of the same village as Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose craze and folly make all of us who know him feel pity for him, and I am one of those who have felt it most; and persuaded that his chance of recovery lay in quiet and keeping at home and in his own house, I hit upon a device for keeping him there. Three months ago, therefore, I went out to meet him as a knight-errant, under the assumed name of the Knight of the Mirrors, intending to engage him in combat and overcome him without hurting him, making it the condition of our combat that the vanquished should be at the disposal of the victor. What I meant to demand of him (for I regarded him as vanquished already) was that he should return to his own village, and not leave it for a whole year, by which time he might he cured. But fate ordered it otherwise, for he vanquished me and unhorsed me, and so my plan failed. He went his way, and I came back conquered, covered with shame, and sorely bruised by my fall, which was a particularly dangerous one. But this did not quench my desire to meet him again and overcome him, as you have seen to-day. And as he is so scrupulous in his observance of the laws of knight-errantry, he will, no doubt, in order to keep his word, obey the injunction I have laid upon him. This, senor, is how the matter stands, and I have nothing more to tell you. I implore of you not to betray me, or tell Don Quixote who I am; so that my honest endeavours may be successful, and that a man of excellent wits — were he only rid of the fooleries of chivalry — may get them back again.”\n “O senor,” said Don Antonio, “may God forgive you the wrong you have done the whole world in trying to bring the most amusing madman in it back to his senses. Do you not see, senor, that the gain by Don Quixote’s sanity can never equal the enjoyment his crazes give? But my belief is that all the senor bachelor’s pains will be of no avail to bring a man so hopelessly cracked to his senses again; and if it were not uncharitable, I would say may Don Quixote never be cured, for by his recovery we lose not only his own drolleries, but his squire Sancho Panza’s too, any one of which is enough to turn melancholy itself into merriment. However, I’ll hold my peace and say nothing to him, and we’ll see whether I am right in my suspicion that Senor Carrasco’s efforts will be fruitless.”\n The bachelor replied that at all events the affair promised well, and he hoped for a happy result from it; and putting his services at Don Antonio’s commands he took his leave of him; and having had his armour packed at once upon a mule, he rode away from the city the same day on the horse he rode to battle, and returned to his own country without meeting any adventure calling for record in this veracious history.\n Don Antonio reported to the viceroy what Carrasco told him, and the viceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with Don Quixote’s retirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anything of his mad doings.\n Six days did Don Quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and out of sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. Sancho strove to comfort him, and among other things he said to him, “Hold up your head, senor, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to heaven that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come off with a broken rib; and, as you know that ‘where they give they take,’ and that ‘there are not always fletches where there are pegs,’ a fig for the doctor, for there’s no need of him to cure this ailment. Let us go home, and give over going about in search of adventures in strange lands and places; rightly looked at, it is I that am the greater loser, though it is your worship that has had the worse usage. With the government I gave up all wish to be a governor again, but I did not give up all longing to be a count; and that will never come to pass if your worship gives up becoming a king by renouncing the calling of chivalry; and so my hopes are going to turn into smoke.”\n “Peace, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “thou seest my suspension and retirement is not to exceed a year; I shall soon return to my honoured calling, and I shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win and a county to bestow on thee.”\n “May God hear it and sin be deaf,” said Sancho; “I have always heard say that ‘a good hope is better than a bad holding.”\n As they were talking Don Antonio came in looking extremely pleased and exclaiming, “Reward me for my good news, Senor Don Quixote! Don Gregorio and the renegade who went for him have come ashore — ashore do I say? They are by this time in the viceroy’s house, and will be here immediately.”\n Don Quixote cheered up a little and said, “Of a truth I am almost ready to say I should have been glad had it turned out just the other way, for it would have obliged me to cross over to Barbary, where by the might of my arm I should have restored to liberty, not only Don Gregorio, but all the Christian captives there are in Barbary. But what am I saying, miserable being that I am? Am I not he that has been conquered? Am I not he that has been overthrown? Am I not he who must not take up arms for a year? Then what am I making professions for; what am I bragging about; when it is fitter for me to handle the distaff than the sword?”\n “No more of that, senor,” said Sancho; “‘let the hen live, even though it be with her pip; ‘today for thee and to-morrow for me;’ in these affairs of encounters and whacks one must not mind them, for he that falls to-day may get up to-morrow; unless indeed he chooses to lie in bed, I mean gives way to weakness and does not pluck up fresh spirit for fresh battles; let your worship get up now to receive Don Gregorio; for the household seems to be in a bustle, and no doubt he has come by this time;” and so it proved, for as soon as Don Gregorio and the renegade had given the viceroy an account of the voyage out and home, Don Gregorio, eager to see Ana Felix, came with the renegade to Don Antonio’s house. When they carried him away from Algiers he was in woman’s dress; on board the vessel, however, he exchanged it for that of a captive who escaped with him; but in whatever dress he might be he looked like one to be loved and served and esteemed, for he was surpassingly well-favoured, and to judge by appearances some seventeen or eighteen years of age. Ricote and his daughter came out to welcome him, the father with tears, the daughter with bashfulness. They did not embrace each other, for where there is deep love there will never be overmuch boldness. Seen side by side, the comeliness of Don Gregorio and the beauty of Ana Felix were the admiration of all who were present. It was silence that spoke for the lovers at that moment, and their eyes were the tongues that declared their pure and happy feelings. The renegade explained the measures and means he had adopted to rescue Don Gregorio, and Don Gregorio at no great length, but in a few words, in which he showed that his intelligence was in advance of his years, described the peril and embarrassment he found himself in among the women with whom he had sojourned. To conclude, Ricote liberally recompensed and rewarded as well the renegade as the men who had rowed; and the renegade effected his readmission into the body of the Church and was reconciled with it, and from a rotten limb became by penance and repentance a clean and sound one.\n Two days later the viceroy discussed with Don Antonio the steps they should take to enable Ana Felix and her father to stay in Spain, for it seemed to them there could be no objection to a daughter who was so good a Christian and a father to all appearance so well disposed remaining there. Don Antonio offered to arrange the matter at the capital, whither he was compelled to go on some other business, hinting that many a difficult affair was settled there with the help of favour and bribes.\n “Nay,” said Ricote, who was present during the conversation, “it will not do to rely upon favour or bribes, because with the great Don Bernardino de Velasco, Conde de Salazar, to whom his Majesty has entrusted our expulsion, neither entreaties nor promises, bribes nor appeals to compassion, are of any use; for though it is true he mingles mercy with justice, still, seeing that the whole body of our nation is tainted and corrupt, he applies to it the cautery that burns rather than the salve that soothes; and thus, by prudence, sagacity, care and the fear he inspires, he has borne on his mighty shoulders the weight of this great policy and carried it into effect, all our schemes and plots, importunities and wiles, being ineffectual to blind his Argus eyes, ever on the watch lest one of us should remain behind in concealment, and like a hidden root come in course of time to sprout and bear poisonous fruit in Spain, now cleansed, and relieved of the fear in which our vast numbers kept it. Heroic resolve of the great Philip the Third, and unparalleled wisdom to have entrusted it to the said Don Bernardino de Velasco!”\n “At any rate,” said Don Antonio, “when I am there I will make all possible efforts, and let heaven do as pleases it best; Don Gregorio will come with me to relieve the anxiety which his parents must be suffering on account of his absence; Ana Felix will remain in my house with my wife, or in a monastery; and I know the viceroy will be glad that the worthy Ricote should stay with him until we see what terms I can make.”\n The viceroy agreed to all that was proposed; but Don Gregorio on learning what had passed declared he could not and would not on any account leave Ana Felix; however, as it was his purpose to go and see his parents and devise some way of returning for her, he fell in with the proposed arrangement. Ana Felix remained with Don Antonio’s wife, and Ricote in the viceroy’s house.\n The day for Don Antonio’s departure came; and two days later that for Don Quixote’s and Sancho’s, for Don Quixote’s fall did not suffer him to take the road sooner. There were tears and sighs, swoonings and sobs, at the parting between Don Gregorio and Ana Felix. Ricote offered Don Gregorio a thousand crowns if he would have them, but he would not take any save five which Don Antonio lent him and he promised to repay at the capital. So the two of them took their departure, and Don Quixote and Sancho afterwards, as has been already said, Don Quixote without his armour and in travelling gear, and Sancho on foot, Dapple being loaded with the armour.\n \n 安东尼奥跟着白月骑士一直走进城里的客店，想弄清他到底是谁。一路上，一群孩子也跟着白月骑士起哄。一个侍从自客店里出来，为白月骑士卸去了盔甲。白月骑士走进一间客房，安东尼奥也跟了进去，他迫不及待地想看到白月骑士的本来面目。白月骑士见安东尼奥紧追不放，便对安东尼奥说道：\n “大人，我知道你想弄清我到底是谁。我没有必要隐瞒你。趁着侍从为我卸去盔甲的工夫，我可以把事情的真相一五一十都告诉你。大人，我是参孙·卡拉斯科学士，与唐吉诃德同住一村。看见他那疯呆模样，我们所有认识他的人都可怜他，特别是我。我们觉得要想让他恢复健康，就得让他回到村里去，在家好好休养。我正是为此而来的。三个月前，我扮成游侠骑士的样子，自称是镜子骑士，在路上等着他，想同他交锋，打败他却又不伤害他，条件是谁败了谁就服从胜利者。我想如果他败了，我向他提出的条件就是让他回到村里去，一年之内不准再出村，也许在这段时间里，他的病可以治愈。谁知天有不测，他把我打败了，把我掀下了马。结果我没有达到预期的目的，他继续走他的路。我被打败了，满心惭愧，而且摔得不轻，只好回家了。不过，我并没有因此就放弃再次找他并打败他的想法。你们今天也看到了，他是个恪守游侠骑士规矩的人，因此，他既然答应了我向他提出的条件，就肯定会说到做到。\n “大人，这就是事情的全部原委。我请求您不要暴露我的身份，也不要告诉唐吉诃德我是谁，以免我的良好愿望落空。他本来是个很聪明的人，只要他放弃那愚蠢的骑士道，就会恢复他的神志。”\n “噢，大人，”安东尼奥说，“愿上帝饶恕您吧！您想让世界上最滑稽的疯子恢复正常，就等于冒犯了大家。您难道没看到吗，大人？一个头脑正常的唐吉诃德给人们带来的利益，并不如一个丑态百出的唐吉诃德给人们带来的乐趣多。我估计，学士大人的计策并不能让一个如此疯癫的人恢复正常。若不是于心不忍，我倒真希望唐吉诃德别恢复正常。因为他一旦恢复正常，我们就不仅失掉了从他身上得到的乐趣，而且也失掉了从他的侍从桑乔·潘萨那儿获得的乐趣。这两种乐趣都足以给人带来欢乐，排忧解愁。尽管如此，我会守口如瓶的，决不向唐吉诃德透露半点儿实情。我想以此来证实我怀疑卡拉斯科大人的计策能否奏效是正确的。”\n 卡拉斯科说，无论怎样，既然事情已经有了开头，他就希望有个圆满的结局。他问安东尼奥还有什么吩咐，然后向安东尼奥告别，把自己的兵器收拾好，放到骡背上，又骑上他刚才同唐吉诃德交战时骑的那匹马，当天就出城返乡了，一路上并没有遇到什么值得记述的事情。安东尼奥把卡拉斯科对他讲的话告诉了总督，总督听了有些沮丧。他觉得唐吉诃德一旦返乡隐居，就失去了可以借他的疯癫开心的那种欢乐。\n 唐吉诃德在床上躺了六天，闷闷不乐，情绪低落，反反复复地想他被打败的倒霉事。桑乔来宽慰他，对他说道：\n “大人，抬起头来，若是可能就高兴起来吧。您得感谢老天，虽然您被打翻在地，却并未摔断一根肋骨。您应该知道，恶有恶报，‘以为那儿有咸肉，其实连挂肉的钩子都没有’。您也别理医生，现在并不需要他们为您看病。咱们还是回家去吧，别再在异地他乡征什么险了。其实您想想，虽然您最倒霉，最吃亏的却还是我。我放弃了总督的位置，不再想当总督了，可是我并没有放弃当伯爵的愿望。如果您放弃做游侠骑士，不当国王，我也就当不成伯爵，我的希望就全部化为乌有了。”\n “住嘴，桑乔，你明白，我退居家乡只不过是一年时间，然后，我还要重操我的光荣事业，那时候还会有王国等着我去征服，也还有伯爵的头衔可以授予你。”\n “愿上帝听见此话，”桑乔说，“充耳不闻的是罪人！我常听人说，‘良好的希望胜过菲薄的实物’。”\n 他们正说着话，安东尼奥走过来，十分高兴地说道：\n “好消息，唐吉诃德大人，格雷戈里奥和去营救他的叛教者已经上岸了。我怎么只说上岸了？他们现在已经在总督家里，并且马上就要到这儿来了。”\n 唐吉诃德略微高兴地说道：\n “说实话，如果事情的结局相反，我倒会更高兴。那样我就得去柏培拉了，用我臂膀的力量解救格雷戈里奥，而且还要解救那里的所有西班牙俘虏。可是，我这个可怜人，还有什么好说的呢？战败者难道不是我吗？被打翻在地的难道不是我吗？一年之内不准再操兵器的难道不是我吗？我都答应了什么？我更适合纺线而不是操剑，我还有什么可夸口的呢？”\n “别这样，大人，”桑乔说，“‘掉了毛的凤凰也赛过鸡’，‘一日河东，一日河西’，‘胜负乃兵家常事’，今天摔倒了，只要不是泄了气趴在床上，我是说只要不自暴自弃，而是准备重振旗鼓，明天就可以重新崛起。您赶快起来接待格雷戈里奥吧，外面人声嘈杂，我估计他们已经到了。”\n 果然如此，在格雷戈里奥和叛教者向总督汇报了他们的情况之后，格雷戈里奥急于见到安娜·费利克斯，就同叛教者一起来到了安东尼奥家。格雷戈里奥从阿尔及尔逃出时仍然身着女装，后来在船上与一个同行的俘虏对换了衣服。可是无论穿什么衣服，他都显得那么惹人喜欢，那么英俊，他太漂亮了。他的年龄看上去大约十七八岁。里科特和女儿出来迎接他。里科特眼含热泪，安娜·费利克斯倒显得有些矜持，两个年轻人并没有互相拥抱。爱情笃厚并不一定要十分外露。格雷戈里奥和安娜·费利克斯这一对儿的美貌使在场的人无不啧啧赞叹。一对情人相对无言，眼睛成了传递他们欢乐而又圣洁的情思的媒介。叛教者讲述了他们设法解救格雷戈里奥的过程，格雷戈里奥则介绍了他在女人堆里的危险和窘境。他没有长篇大论，而是寥寥数语，表现了一种少年老成的智慧。后来里科特慷慨解囊，酬谢了划船的水手。叛教者重又皈依了圣教，他那已腐烂的身体经过忏悔认罪重又纯洁健康了。\n 两天之后，总督同安东尼奥商量，怎样才能让安娜·费利克斯和她父亲留在西班牙。他们觉得，把如此虔诚的基督徒安娜·费利克斯和她的善良的父亲留在西班牙，并没有什么不合适的地方。安东尼奥自告奋勇到京城去游说这件事，而且他正好有事要到京城去办。他觉得在京城通过熟人关系送点儿礼，很多麻烦的事情都可以迎刃而解。\n “并非如此，”里科特在一旁听到了安东尼奥的话之后说道，“靠熟人关系和送礼并不能解决问题。对于我们的萨拉萨尔伯爵、伟大的唐贝尔纳迪诺·德委拉斯科大人来说，任何乞求、许诺、送礼和可怜相都无济于事。当初，皇上就是责成他把我们赶走的。虽然他对我们恩威并用，可是他看透了我们这个民族已病入膏肓，只能用烧灼疗法来根治，不能再用涂膏药来敷衍了。于是，他凭着他那处事谨慎、嗅觉灵敏、聪明的才智和令人生畏的威严挑起了这副重担，无论我们如何绞尽脑汁、费尽心机、苦苦哀求或者企图蒙混过关，都无法逃脱他那双阿尔戈斯①的眼睛。他总是时刻警惕着，不让我们任何一个人能够留下来，不让任何一件事瞒住他。万一有根茎留下来，随着时间的流逝，就会在西班牙发芽并结出毒果。而目前，西班牙已经彻底排除了由于我们存在而造成的隐患。菲利普三世责成唐贝尔纳迪诺·德委拉斯科负责这件事，这是多么大胆的决定，多么英明的决策呀！”\n ①希腊神话中的三眼、四眼或多眼怪物，力大无穷，睡觉的时候总睁着一些眼睛。\n “无论如何，我到了京城以后都会尽力而为。谋事在人，成事在天。”安东尼奥说，“格雷戈里奥同我一起去。他走了以后，他的父母很伤心，他也得安抚一下父母。安娜·费利克斯不妨同我夫人留在家里或者到修道院去。我知道总督大人很愿意让善良的里科特到他家去，然后等我回来再视情况作出决定。”\n 总督同意安东尼奥的意见，可是格雷戈里奥说，他无论如何也不愿意和不能离开安娜·费利克斯。不过，后来考虑到还得去见父母，回来后仍然可以找她，他便同意了。于是，安娜·费利克斯留下来同安东尼奥的夫人在一起，里科特去了总督家。\n 安东尼奥出发的日子到了。唐吉诃德因为摔伤了，不便赶路，因此和桑乔又呆了两天才走。格雷戈里奥同安娜·费利克斯告别时，两人哭得死去活来。里科特对格雷戈里奥说，如果他愿意，可以给他一千个盾。可是格雷戈里奥一个盾也没要，只是向安东尼奥借了五个盾，而且说到京城之后一定还。于是两人上路了。两天之后，唐吉诃德和桑乔也离开了。唐吉诃德没有穿盔甲，只是一身便装。桑乔的驴驮着盔甲，因而桑乔只能步行跟在后面。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4686.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
