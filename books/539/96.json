{"id":42236,"no":96,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 42","content":"The duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and droll result of the adventure of the Distressed One, that they resolved to carry on the joke, seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with for making it all pass for reality. So having laid their plans and given instructions to their servants and vassals how to behave to Sancho in his government of the promised island, the next day, that following Clavileno’s flight, the duke told Sancho to prepare and get ready to go and be governor, for his islanders were already looking out for him as for the showers of May.\n Sancho made him an obeisance, and said, “Ever since I came down from heaven, and from the top of it beheld the earth, and saw how little it is, the great desire I had to be a governor has been partly cooled in me; for what is there grand in being ruler on a grain of mustard seed, or what dignity or authority in governing half a dozen men about as big as hazel nuts; for, so far as I could see, there were no more on the whole earth? If your lordship would be so good as to give me ever so small a bit of heaven, were it no more than half a league, I’d rather have it than the best island in the world.”\n “Recollect, Sancho,” said the duke, “I cannot give a bit of heaven, no not so much as the breadth of my nail, to anyone; rewards and favours of that sort are reserved for God alone. What I can give I give you, and that is a real, genuine island, compact, well proportioned, and uncommonly fertile and fruitful, where, if you know how to use your opportunities, you may, with the help of the world’s riches, gain those of heaven.”\n “Well then,” said Sancho, “let the island come; and I’ll try and be such a governor, that in spite of scoundrels I’ll go to heaven; and it’s not from any craving to quit my own humble condition or better myself, but from the desire I have to try what it tastes like to be a governor.”\n “If you once make trial of it, Sancho,” said the duke, “you’ll eat your fingers off after the government, so sweet a thing is it to command and be obeyed. Depend upon it when your master comes to be emperor (as he will beyond a doubt from the course his affairs are taking), it will be no easy matter to wrest the dignity from him, and he will be sore and sorry at heart to have been so long without becoming one.”\n “Senor,” said Sancho, “it is my belief it’s a good thing to be in command, if it’s only over a drove of cattle.”\n “May I be buried with you, Sancho,” said the duke, “but you know everything; I hope you will make as good a governor as your sagacity promises; and that is all I have to say; and now remember to-morrow is the day you must set out for the government of the island, and this evening they will provide you with the proper attire for you to wear, and all things requisite for your departure.”\n “Let them dress me as they like,” said Sancho; “however I’m dressed I’ll be Sancho Panza.”\n “That’s true,” said the duke; “but one’s dress must be suited to the office or rank one holds; for it would not do for a jurist to dress like a soldier, or a soldier like a priest. You, Sancho, shall go partly as a lawyer, partly as a captain, for, in the island I am giving you, arms are needed as much as letters, and letters as much as arms.”\n “Of letters I know but little,” said Sancho, “for I don’t even know the A B C; but it is enough for me to have the Christus in my memory to be a good governor. As for arms, I’ll handle those they give me till I drop, and then, God be my help!”\n “With so good a memory,” said the duke, “Sancho cannot go wrong in anything.”\n Here Don Quixote joined them; and learning what passed, and how soon Sancho was to go to his government, he with the duke’s permission took him by the hand, and retired to his room with him for the purpose of giving him advice as to how he was to demean himself in his office. As soon as they had entered the chamber he closed the door after him, and almost by force made Sancho sit down beside him, and in a quiet tone thus addressed him: “I give infinite thanks to heaven, friend Sancho, that, before I have met with any good luck, fortune has come forward to meet thee. I who counted upon my good fortune to discharge the recompense of thy services, find myself still waiting for advancement, while thou, before the time, and contrary to all reasonable expectation, seest thyself blessed in the fulfillment of thy desires. Some will bribe, beg, solicit, rise early, entreat, persist, without attaining the object of their suit; while another comes, and without knowing why or wherefore, finds himself invested with the place or office so many have sued for; and here it is that the common saying, ‘There is good luck as well as bad luck in suits,’ applies. Thou, who, to my thinking, art beyond all doubt a dullard, without early rising or night watching or taking any trouble, with the mere breath of knight-errantry that has breathed upon thee, seest thyself without more ado governor of an island, as though it were a mere matter of course. This I say, Sancho, that thou attribute not the favour thou hast received to thine own merits, but give thanks to heaven that disposes matters beneficently, and secondly thanks to the great power the profession of knight-errantry contains in itself. With a heart, then, inclined to believe what I have said to thee, attend, my son, to thy Cato here who would counsel thee and be thy polestar and guide to direct and pilot thee to a safe haven out of this stormy sea wherein thou art about to ingulf thyself; for offices and great trusts are nothing else but a mighty gulf of troubles.\n “First of all, my son, thou must fear God, for in the fear of him is wisdom, and being wise thou canst not err in aught.\n “Secondly, thou must keep in view what thou art, striving to know thyself, the most difficult thing to know that the mind can imagine. If thou knowest thyself, it will follow thou wilt not puff thyself up like the frog that strove to make himself as large as the ox; if thou dost, the recollection of having kept pigs in thine own country will serve as the ugly feet for the wheel of thy folly.”\n “That’s the truth,” said Sancho; “but that was when I was a boy; afterwards when I was something more of a man it was geese I kept, not pigs. But to my thinking that has nothing to do with it; for all who are governors don’t come of a kingly stock.”\n “True,” said Don Quixote, “and for that reason those who are not of noble origin should take care that the dignity of the office they hold he accompanied by a gentle suavity, which wisely managed will save them from the sneers of malice that no station escapes.\n “Glory in thy humble birth, Sancho, and he not ashamed of saying thou art peasant-born; for when it is seen thou art not ashamed no one will set himself to put thee to the blush; and pride thyself rather upon being one of lowly virtue than a lofty sinner. Countless are they who, born of mean parentage, have risen to the highest dignities, pontifical and imperial, and of the truth of this I could give thee instances enough to weary thee.\n “Remember, Sancho, if thou make virtue thy aim, and take a pride in doing virtuous actions, thou wilt have no cause to envy those who have princely and lordly ones, for blood is an inheritance, but virtue an acquisition, and virtue has in itself alone a worth that blood does not possess.\n “This being so, if perchance anyone of thy kinsfolk should come to see thee when thou art in thine island, thou art not to repel or slight him, but on the contrary to welcome him, entertain him, and make much of him; for in so doing thou wilt be approved of heaven (which is not pleased that any should despise what it hath made), and wilt comply with the laws of well-ordered nature.\n “If thou carriest thy wife with thee (and it is not well for those that administer governments to be long without their wives), teach and instruct her, and strive to smooth down her natural roughness; for all that may be gained by a wise governor may be lost and wasted by a boorish stupid wife.\n “If perchance thou art left a widower — a thing which may happen — and in virtue of thy office seekest a consort of higher degree, choose not one to serve thee for a hook, or for a fishing-rod, or for the hood of thy ‘won’t have it;’ for verily, I tell thee, for all the judge’s wife receives, the husband will be held accountable at the general calling to account; where he will have repay in death fourfold, items that in life he regarded as naught.\n “Never go by arbitrary law, which is so much favoured by ignorant men who plume themselves on cleverness.\n “Let the tears of the poor man find with thee more compassion, but not more justice, than the pleadings of the rich.\n “Strive to lay bare the truth, as well amid the promises and presents of the rich man, as amid the sobs and entreaties of the poor.\n “When equity may and should be brought into play, press not the utmost rigour of the law against the guilty; for the reputation of the stern judge stands not higher than that of the compassionate.\n “If perchance thou permittest the staff of justice to swerve, let it be not by the weight of a gift, but by that of mercy.\n “If it should happen thee to give judgment in the cause of one who is thine enemy, turn thy thoughts away from thy injury and fix them on the justice of the case.\n “Let not thine own passion blind thee in another man’s cause; for the errors thou wilt thus commit will be most frequently irremediable; or if not, only to be remedied at the expense of thy good name and even of thy fortune.\n “If any handsome woman come to seek justice of thee, turn away thine eyes from her tears and thine ears from her lamentations, and consider deliberately the merits of her demand, if thou wouldst not have thy reason swept away by her weeping, and thy rectitude by her sighs.\n “Abuse not by word him whom thou hast to punish in deed, for the pain of punishment is enough for the unfortunate without the addition of thine objurgations.\n “Bear in mind that the culprit who comes under thy jurisdiction is but a miserable man subject to all the propensities of our depraved nature, and so far as may be in thy power show thyself lenient and forbearing; for though the attributes of God are all equal, to our eyes that of mercy is brighter and loftier than that of justice.\n “If thou followest these precepts and rules, Sancho, thy days will be long, thy fame eternal, thy reward abundant, thy felicity unutterable; thou wilt marry thy children as thou wouldst; they and thy grandchildren will bear titles; thou wilt live in peace and concord with all men; and, when life draws to a close, death will come to thee in calm and ripe old age, and the light and loving hands of thy great-grandchildren will close thine eyes.\n “What I have thus far addressed to thee are instructions for the adornment of thy mind; listen now to those which tend to that of the body.”\n \n 的谆谆教导以及其他深思熟虑的嘱咐\n 所谓忧伤妇人苦难的滑稽闹剧顺利结束。公爵和公爵夫人见唐吉诃德和桑乔竟信以为真，便决定把这个玩笑再开下去。于是，他们吩咐佣人和下属，继续同桑乔开总督的玩笑。第二天，也就是乘木马飞行之后的那天，公爵通知桑乔准备赴任去当总督，说他的岛屿臣民正对他翘首以待呢。桑乔对公爵鞠了一躬，说道：\n “自从我由天上下来之后，自从我居高临下地看地球，看到地球是那么小之后，我原来一心要当总督的劲头就有所减少了。在芥菜子那么大的地方当官有什么了不起呢？管辖十几个榛子大小的人也没什么可神气的。地球上难道就没有其他事可做了吗？如果您能给我一小块天空，哪怕只有半里地，我也宁愿要这块天空，而不要地上最大的岛屿。”\n “可是桑乔朋友，”公爵说，“我不能给谁一小块天空，哪怕只是指甲那么大一块也不行。只有上帝才能恩赐天空。我能给你的只是一个地地道道的岛屿，十分肥沃。你如果真有本领，完全可以利用地上的财富去赢得天上的财富。”\n “那好，”桑乔说，“我就要那个岛屿吧。我一定当好总督。不过，即使有千难万险，以后我还是要上天。这倒不是我贪心太大或者不自量力，我只是想尝尝当总督的滋味。”\n “一旦你尝到了这种滋味，桑乔，”公爵说，“你肯定会难舍难离。发号施令是一件很美的事情。根据目前的情况，你的主人准会当上皇帝。我敢肯定，他当了皇帝以后，谁也别想再把他拉下来。到那时，他心里最难受的肯定是没能早点当上皇帝。”\n “大人，”桑乔说，“我觉得，即使是对一群牲畜发号施令，也是件挺美的事儿。”\n “我的看法和你一样，桑乔，你真是心明眼亮。”公爵说，“我希望你能做个像你说的那样的总督。这件事就说到这儿吧。明天你就要去做岛屿总督了，今天下午，你就收拾该准备的衣服和其他启程需要的东西吧。”\n “随便给我穿什么都行，”桑乔说，“不管穿什么衣服，我总归是桑乔。”\n “话虽这么说，”公爵说，“衣服还是应该与人的职业和身份相称。法官穿得像个士兵就不合适，士兵穿得像个牧师也不妥。你得穿得既像文官，又像武官，因为在我给你的那个岛上，既需要文，也需要武，既需要武，也需要文。”\n “若论文的我不行，”桑乔说，“我大字不识一个。不过，只要我记好一个‘十’字，就能当好总督。若论武的，给我什么家伙我都能使，直到使不动为止，到那时就只好听天由命了。”\n “你既然有这么好的记性，”公爵说，“就不会出错儿。”\n 这时候唐吉诃德来了。他听说桑乔要当总督，而且马上就要赴任，便征得公爵同意，拉着桑乔的手，来到自己的房间，想告诉桑乔应该怎样当总督。一进房间，唐吉诃德就随手关上门，几乎是硬按着桑乔坐在自己身边，心平气和地说道：\n “我得万分感谢老天，桑乔朋友，老天让你先于我交上了好运。我本来指望待我发迹后再酬劳你。现在我刚刚开始时来运转，你却超乎常规地提前实现了自己的愿望。有的人又是贿赂，又是托人，又是起早贪黑，又是乞求，又是纠缠，却并没有得到他们想要得到的东西。而有的人还不知道是怎么回事，就得到了别人梦寐以求的职位。在我看来，你只不过是个笨蛋，并没有起早贪黑地干，也没有出什么气力，只凭游侠骑士给你带来的福分，就不费吹灰之力地成了一个岛屿的总督。桑乔，我说这些无非是让你不要把得来的好处归功于自己，而应该感谢暗中掌握着万物的老天，还应该感谢伟大的骑士道。你应该真心相信我对你说的这些话，孩子，仔细倾听你这位卡顿的话吧。他在开导你，他是指引你进入安全港湾的北斗星。你就要驶入惊涛骇浪的大海了，官场就好比是波涛汹涌的大海哟！\n “孩子，你首先应该畏惧上帝，畏惧上帝就是智慧，有了智慧就不会犯任何错误。\n “第二，你应该认清你自己到底是什么人，尽力做到有自知之明，这是最难能可贵的。有自知之明，你才不会像妄想跟牛比大小的蛤蟆那样自大。你得意忘形的时候，只须想想自己曾在家乡喂过猪，就会像开屏的孔雀看到自己的丑脚一样清醒了。”\n “话是这么说，”桑乔说，“但那时我还是个孩子。后来我大点儿了，喂的就是鹅而不是猪了。不过，我对此并不在意，并非所有的总督都是皇亲贵族呀！”\n “是啊，”唐吉诃德说，“所以，那些非贵族出身的人担任了要职，要宽以待人，谨慎处事，免得遭到恶意中伤。任何职位的人都可能遭到恶意中伤。\n “你应该以你的卑微出身为荣，桑乔，不要耻于说自己出自农家。只要你不作贱自己，别人也不会作贱你。你应该为自己是一个正直的平民，不是一个高贵的罪人而感到自豪。有许许多多出身低下的人最后当上了教皇或皇帝，这种情况的例子数不胜数哩。\n “桑乔，如果你以道德为重，以做正直的事情为荣，你就不必去羡慕那些豪门贵族，因为血统可以继承，道德却不能世袭。道德本身就具有价值，而血统本身却不值分文。\n “所以，假如你到了岛上，有什么亲戚来看望你，你不要撵他走，也不要对他发火，而应该热情款待他。这样不仅老天满意，因为老天总希望人们不鄙视自己的过去，而且也顺应了民情。\n “当总督的长期不带老婆恐怕不合适。如果你把老婆接去了，就应该教导她，使她克服陋习。常常有这种情况：一个贤明的总督做了好事，却被他愚蠢的老婆给毁了。\n “万一你成了鳏夫，这种事完全有可能发生，你想利用你的职位找到更好的配偶，可千万别找那种想拿你当工具，嘴里说不要，却伸着手要钱的女人。我告诉你，即使是法官的老婆勒索了别人的钱，到了阴间以后也还是要法官把他生前该负责的那部分加倍偿还。\n “许多自以为聪明的蠢人总是依照自己的意志办案，你可千万不要这样。\n “无论是富人许诺或馈赠，还是穷人流泪或纠缠，你都要注意查明真相。\n “只要能宽恕，就不要严酷苛刻，严厉法官的名声毕竟不如好心肠法官的名声。\n “如果你审理某个冤家对头的案子，一定要排除个人感情，实事求是地判案。\n “你不要徇私枉法。案子判错了往往无法补救，即使能够补救，也会损害自己的名誉和财产。\n “如果有漂亮的女人请你办案，你一定不要被她的眼泪和呻吟蒙蔽，要仔细研究她所要求的内容，免得让她的哭泣影响你的理智，让她的唉声叹气动摇了你的心。\n “对于那些必须动刑法的人不要再恶语相向。他受了刑本来就很不幸，就不要再辱骂了。\n “把你处分的罪人看成是本性未改的可怜虫，尤其是从你这方面不要伤害他，要对他宽容。虽然仁爱和公正同样是上帝的品德，但我们总觉得宽容比严厉更可取。\n “如果你能够按照这些话去做，桑乔，你就会长命百岁，英名永存，功禄难以估量，幸福难以形容，就可以使你的子女婚姻美满，你的子孙后代留名，你就能与大家和睦相处，就能安度晚年，到你百年时，你的重孙们就会为你轻轻合上眼睛。我刚才是教你如何美化你的灵魂，现在，我再来告诉你如何美化你的外表吧。”\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4663.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
