{"id":42242,"no":102,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 48","content":"Exceedingly moody and dejected was the sorely wounded Don Quixote, with his face bandaged and marked, not by the hand of God, but by the claws of a cat, mishaps incidental to knight-errantry. Six days he remained without appearing in public, and one night as he lay awake thinking of his misfortunes and of Altisidora’s pursuit of him, he perceived that some one was opening the door of his room with a key, and he at once made up his mind that the enamoured damsel was coming to make an assault upon his chastity and put him in danger of failing in the fidelity he owed to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso. “No,” said he, firmly persuaded of the truth of his idea (and he said it loud enough to be heard), “the greatest beauty upon earth shall not avail to make me renounce my adoration of her whom I bear stamped and graved in the core of my heart and the secret depths of my bowels; be thou, lady mine, transformed into a clumsy country wench, or into a nymph of golden Tagus weaving a web of silk and gold, let Merlin or Montesinos hold thee captive where they will; whereer thou art, thou art mine, and where’er I am, must he thine.” The very instant he had uttered these words, the door opened. He stood up on the bed wrapped from head to foot in a yellow satin coverlet, with a cap on his head, and his face and his moustaches tied up, his face because of the scratches, and his moustaches to keep them from drooping and falling down, in which trim he looked the most extraordinary scarecrow that could be conceived. He kept his eyes fixed on the door, and just as he was expecting to see the love-smitten and unhappy Altisidora make her appearance, he saw coming in a most venerable duenna, in a long white-bordered veil that covered and enveloped her from head to foot. Between the fingers of her left hand she held a short lighted candle, while with her right she shaded it to keep the light from her eyes, which were covered by spectacles of great size, and she advanced with noiseless steps, treading very softly. Don Quixote kept an eye upon her from his watchtower, and observing her costume and noting her silence, he concluded that it must be some witch or sorceress that was coming in such a guise to work him some mischief, and he began crossing himself at a great rate. The spectre still advanced, and on reaching the middle of the room, looked up and saw the energy with which Don Quixote was crossing himself; and if he was scared by seeing such a figure as hers, she was terrified at the sight of his; for the moment she saw his tall yellow form with the coverlet and the bandages that disfigured him, she gave a loud scream, and exclaiming, “Jesus! what’s this I see?” let fall the candle in her fright, and then finding herself in the dark, turned about to make off, but stumbling on her skirts in her consternation, she measured her length with a mighty fall. Don Quixote in his trepidation began saying, “I conjure thee, phantom, or whatever thou art, tell me what thou art and what thou wouldst with me. If thou art a soul in torment, say so, and all that my powers can do I will do for thee; for I am a Catholic Christian and love to do good to all the world, and to this end I have embraced the order of knight-errantry to which I belong, the province of which extends to doing good even to souls in purgatory.” The unfortunate duenna hearing herself thus conjured, by her own fear guessed Don Quixote’s and in a low plaintive voice answered, “Senor Don Quixote — if so be you are indeed Don Quixote — I am no phantom or spectre or soul in purgatory, as you seem to think, but Dona Rodriguez, duenna of honour to my lady the duchess, and I come to you with one of those grievances your worship is wont to redress.” “Tell me, Senora Dona Rodriguez,” said Don Quixote, “do you perchance come to transact any go-between business? Because I must tell you I am not available for anybody’s purpose, thanks to the peerless beauty of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso. In short, Senora Dona Rodriguez, if you will leave out and put aside all love messages, you may go and light your candle and come back, and we will discuss all the commands you have for me and whatever you wish, saving only, as I said, all seductive communications.” “I carry nobody’s messages, senor,” said the duenna; “little you know me. Nay, I’m not far enough advanced in years to take to any such childish tricks. God be praised I have a soul in my body still, and all my teeth and grinders in my mouth, except one or two that the colds, so common in this Aragon country, have robbed me of. But wait a little, while I go and light my candle, and I will return immediately and lay my sorrows before you as before one who relieves those of all the world;” and without staying for an answer she quitted the room and left Don Quixote tranquilly meditating while he waited for her. A thousand thoughts at once suggested themselves to him on the subject of this new adventure, and it struck him as being ill done and worse advised in him to expose himself to the danger of breaking his plighted faith to his lady; and said he to himself, “Who knows but that the devil, being wily and cunning, may be trying now to entrap me with a duenna, having failed with empresses, queens, duchesses, marchionesses, and countesses? Many a time have I heard it said by many a man of sense that he will sooner offer you a flat-nosed wench than a roman-nosed one; and who knows but this privacy, this opportunity, this silence, may awaken my sleeping desires, and lead me in these my latter years to fall where I have never tripped? In cases of this sort it is better to flee than to await the battle. But I must be out of my senses to think and utter such nonsense; for it is impossible that a long, white-hooded spectacled duenna could stir up or excite a wanton thought in the most graceless bosom in the world. Is there a duenna on earth that has fair flesh? Is there a duenna in the world that escapes being ill-tempered, wrinkled, and prudish? Avaunt, then, ye duenna crew, undelightful to all mankind. Oh, but that lady did well who, they say, had at the end of her reception room a couple of figures of duennas with spectacles and lace-cushions, as if at work, and those statues served quite as well to give an air of propriety to the room as if they had been real duennas.” So saying he leaped off the bed, intending to close the door and not allow Senora Rodriguez to enter; but as he went to shut it Senora Rodriguez returned with a wax candle lighted, and having a closer view of Don Quixote, with the coverlet round him, and his bandages and night-cap, she was alarmed afresh, and retreating a couple of paces, exclaimed, “Am I safe, sir knight? for I don’t look upon it as a sign of very great virtue that your worship should have got up out of bed.” “I may well ask the same, senora,” said Don Quixote; “and I do ask whether I shall be safe from being assailed and forced?” “Of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?” said the duenna. “Of you and against you I ask it,” said Don Quixote; “for I am not marble, nor are you brass, nor is it now ten o’clock in the morning, but midnight, or a trifle past it I fancy, and we are in a room more secluded and retired than the cave could have been where the treacherous and daring AEneas enjoyed the fair soft-hearted Dido. But give me your hand, senora; I require no better protection than my own continence, and my own sense of propriety; as well as that which is inspired by that venerable head-dress;” and so saying he kissed her right hand and took it in his own, she yielding it to him with equal ceremoniousness. And here Cide Hamete inserts a parenthesis in which he says that to have seen the pair marching from the door to the bed, linked hand in hand in this way, he would have given the best of the two tunics he had. Don Quixote finally got into bed, and Dona Rodriguez took her seat on a chair at some little distance from his couch, without taking off her spectacles or putting aside the candle. Don Quixote wrapped the bedclothes round him and covered himself up completely, leaving nothing but his face visible, and as soon as they had both regained their composure he broke silence, saying, “Now, Senora Dona Rodriguez, you may unbosom yourself and out with everything you have in your sorrowful heart and afflicted bowels; and by me you shall be listened to with chaste ears, and aided by compassionate exertions.” “I believe it,” replied the duenna; “from your worship’s gentle and winning presence only such a Christian answer could be expected. The fact is, then, Senor Don Quixote, that though you see me seated in this chair, here in the middle of the kingdom of Aragon, and in the attire of a despised outcast duenna, I am from the Asturias of Oviedo, and of a family with which many of the best of the province are connected by blood; but my untoward fate and the improvidence of my parents, who, I know not how, were unseasonably reduced to poverty, brought me to the court of Madrid, where as a provision and to avoid greater misfortunes, my parents placed me as seamstress in the service of a lady of quality, and I would have you know that for hemming and sewing I have never been surpassed by any all my life. My parents left me in service and returned to their own country, and a few years later went, no doubt, to heaven, for they were excellent good Catholic Christians. I was left an orphan with nothing but the miserable wages and trifling presents that are given to servants of my sort in palaces; but about this time, without any encouragement on my part, one of the esquires of the household fell in love with me, a man somewhat advanced in years, full-bearded and personable, and above all as good a gentleman as the king himself, for he came of a mountain stock. We did not carry on our loves with such secrecy but that they came to the knowledge of my lady, and she, not to have any fuss about it, had us married with the full sanction of the holy mother Roman Catholic Church, of which marriage a daughter was born to put an end to my good fortune, if I had any; not that I died in childbirth, for I passed through it safely and in due season, but because shortly afterwards my husband died of a certain shock he received, and had I time to tell you of it I know your worship would be surprised;” and here she began to weep bitterly and said, “Pardon me, Senor Don Quixote, if I am unable to control myself, for every time I think of my unfortunate husband my eyes fill up with tears. God bless me, with what an air of dignity he used to carry my lady behind him on a stout mule as black as jet! for in those days they did not use coaches or chairs, as they say they do now, and ladies rode behind their squires. This much at least I cannot help telling you, that you may observe the good breeding and punctiliousness of my worthy husband. As he was turning into the Calle de Santiago in Madrid, which is rather narrow, one of the alcaldes of the Court, with two alguacils before him, was coming out of it, and as soon as my good squire saw him he wheeled his mule about and made as if he would turn and accompany him. My lady, who was riding behind him, said to him in a low voice, ‘What are you about, you sneak, don’t you see that I am here?’ The alcalde like a polite man pulled up his horse and said to him, ‘Proceed, senor, for it is I, rather, who ought to accompany my lady Dona Casilda’ — for that was my mistress’s name. Still my husband, cap in hand, persisted in trying to accompany the alcalde, and seeing this my lady, filled with rage and vexation, pulled out a big pin, or, I rather think, a bodkin, out of her needle-case and drove it into his back with such force that my husband gave a loud yell, and writhing fell to the ground with his lady. Her two lacqueys ran to rise her up, and the alcalde and the alguacils did the same; the Guadalajara gate was all in commotion — I mean the idlers congregated there; my mistress came back on foot, and my husband hurried away to a barber’s shop protesting that he was run right through the guts. The courtesy of my husband was noised abroad to such an extent, that the boys gave him no peace in the street; and on this account, and because he was somewhat shortsighted, my lady dismissed him; and it was chagrin at this I am convinced beyond a doubt that brought on his death. I was left a helpless widow, with a daughter on my hands growing up in beauty like the sea-foam; at length, however, as I had the character of being an excellent needlewoman, my lady the duchess, then lately married to my lord the duke, offered to take me with her to this kingdom of Aragon, and my daughter also, and here as time went by my daughter grew up and with her all the graces in the world; she sings like a lark, dances quick as thought, foots it like a gipsy, reads and writes like a schoolmaster, and does sums like a miser; of her neatness I say nothing, for the running water is not purer, and her age is now, if my memory serves me, sixteen years five months and three days, one more or less. To come to the point, the son of a very rich farmer, living in a village of my lord the duke’s not very far from here, fell in love with this girl of mine; and in short, how I know not, they came together, and under the promise of marrying her he made a fool of my daughter, and will not keep his word. And though my lord the duke is aware of it (for I have complained to him, not once but many and many a time, and entreated him to order the farmer to marry my daughter), he turns a deaf ear and will scarcely listen to me; the reason being that as the deceiver’s father is so rich, and lends him money, and is constantly going security for his debts, he does not like to offend or annoy him in any way. Now, senor, I want your worship to take it upon yourself to redress this wrong either by entreaty or by arms; for by what all the world says you came into it to redress grievances and right wrongs and help the unfortunate. Let your worship put before you the unprotected condition of my daughter, her youth, and all the perfections I have said she possesses; and before God and on my conscience, out of all the damsels my lady has, there is not one that comes up to the sole of her shoe, and the one they call Altisidora, and look upon as the boldest and gayest of them, put in comparison with my daughter, does not come within two leagues of her. For I would have you know, senor, all is not gold that glitters, and that same little Altisidora has more forwardness than good looks, and more impudence than modesty; besides being not very sound, for she has such a disagreeable breath that one cannot bear to be near her for a moment; and even my lady the duchess — but I’ll hold my tongue, for they say that walls have ears.” “For heaven’s sake, Dona Rodriguez, what ails my lady the duchess?” asked Don Quixote. “Adjured in that way,” replied the duenna, “I cannot help answering the question and telling the whole truth. Senor Don Quixote, have you observed the comeliness of my lady the duchess, that smooth complexion of hers like a burnished polished sword, those two cheeks of milk and carmine, that gay lively step with which she treads or rather seems to spurn the earth, so that one would fancy she went radiating health wherever she passed? Well then, let me tell you she may thank, first of all God, for this, and next, two issues that she has, one in each leg, by which all the evil humours, of which the doctors say she is full, are discharged.” “Blessed Virgin!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “and is it possible that my lady the duchess has drains of that sort? I would not have believed it if the barefoot friars had told it me; but as the lady Dona Rodriguez says so, it must be so. But surely such issues, and in such places, do not discharge humours, but liquid amber. Verily, I do believe now that this practice of opening issues is a very important matter for the health.” Don Quixote had hardly said this, when the chamber door flew open with a loud bang, and with the start the noise gave her Dona Rodriguez let the candle fall from her hand, and the room was left as dark as a wolf’s mouth, as the saying is. Suddenly the poor duenna felt two hands seize her by the throat, so tightly that she could not croak, while some one else, without uttering a word, very briskly hoisted up her petticoats, and with what seemed to be a slipper began to lay on so heartily that anyone would have felt pity for her; but although Don Quixote felt it he never stirred from his bed, but lay quiet and silent, nay apprehensive that his turn for a drubbing might be coming. Nor was the apprehension an idle one; one; for leaving the duenna (who did not dare to cry out) well basted, the silent executioners fell upon Don Quixote, and stripping him of the sheet and the coverlet, they pinched him so fast and so hard that he was driven to defend himself with his fists, and all this in marvellous silence. The battle lasted nearly half an hour, and then the phantoms fled; Dona Rodriguez gathered up her skirts, and bemoaning her fate went out without saying a word to Don Quixote, and he, sorely pinched, puzzled, and dejected, remained alone, and there we will leave him, wondering who could have been the perverse enchanter who had reduced him to such a state; but that shall be told in due season, for Sancho claims our attention, and the methodical arrangement of the story demands it. 的一场风波，以及其他值得永世不忘的事件 唐吉诃德受了伤，十分懊丧。他脸上的印迹不是上帝留下的，而是猫抓的。这是游侠骑士难免的倒霉事儿。在他没露面的六天里，有一个晚上，他思量着自己遇到的种种不幸以及阿尔蒂西多拉的纠缠，夜不能寐。忽然，他觉得有人用钥匙开他房间的门，于是马上想到是那个多情的阿尔蒂西多拉想趁他不注意，迫使他失去对杜尔西内亚的忠贞。他对此确信无疑，就把嗓门提高到可以让对方听到的程度，说道：“就是世界上最漂亮的女子，也不会让我放弃我对我夫人发自内心最深处的崇拜。我的夫人，无论你变成丑陋的农妇还是变成金色塔霍河里正在用金色丝纱编织锦绣的仙女，无论你被梅尔林或蒙特西诺斯关在什么地方，你都属于我；而我无论在什么地方，也都属于你。” 唐吉诃德刚说完这几句话，门就开了。他连忙在床上站起来，从头到脚裹着黄缎床单，头上扣着一顶便帽，脸上和胡子上都缠着纱布。脸是因为被猫抓的，胡子是因为要它向上翘。他这副样子，看上去真像个幽灵。他两眼盯着门，满以为进来的是已经被他弄得神魂颠倒而且心灵受伤的阿尔蒂西多拉，却没想到进来的是一个极其庄重的女佣。她身上穿着又宽又长的白色长袍，长袍把她从头到脚都盖住了。她左手拿着半截点燃的蜡烛，右手遮着眼，以免烛光直射她的眼睛。她慢慢地移动着脚步，落地很轻。 唐吉诃德站在床上，看到进来一个这样装束的怪物，而且脚步特别轻，以为是一个巫婆或女魔法师来害他，立刻慌不迭地画起十字来。女佣走到房子中间，一抬头，立刻看到了正在画十字的唐吉诃德。刚才唐吉诃德看到她时非常害怕，现在，她看到唐吉诃德那又高又黄的裹着床单和纱布的怪样子就更害怕了，不由得大叫一声说道： “天哪，我看到的是什么？” 惊慌之中蜡烛掉到了地上，周围一片漆黑。她转身想跑，可又被裙子绊住了，摔了个大跟头。只听唐吉诃德胆战心惊地说道： “幽灵，或者随便你是谁，我向你发誓，只要你告诉我你是谁，到我这儿想干什么，即使你是个冤魂，我也会尽我的全部力量帮助你。我是个天主教徒，愿意对所有人行善，而且我也正是为此才当上游侠骑士的。我甚至对炼狱里的鬼魂行善。” 惊魂未定的女佣听了这番带着恐惧腔调的发誓，猜出是唐吉诃德，就沉痛地低声说道： “唐吉诃德大人，如果您确实就是唐吉诃德的话，我告诉您，我不是幽灵，不是怪物，也不是鬼魂。您大概也猜到了，我是您尊贵的女主人公爵夫人的女佣唐娜罗德里格斯。有些事只有您帮忙才能解决，我正是为了这样一件事而来的。” “说吧，唐娜罗德里格斯夫人。”唐吉诃德说，“你是不是来给我拉皮条的？我告诉你，为了举世无双的美人杜尔西内亚，我不会被任何人引诱。一句话，我告诉你，唐娜罗德里格斯夫人，只要你不提那些男女私情的事，你不妨先回去点上蜡烛再来。你有什么吩咐，想干什么，咱们都可以商量，就像我刚才说的，只要不是那种邪门歪道的事就行。” “我给谁拉皮条呀，大人？”女佣说，“您真是看错人了。我这把年纪还不至于糊涂到那种程度，去干那种卑鄙的事情呀。托上帝的福，我身体健康，除了因为感冒掉了几颗牙之外，我的牙齿仍然很齐全。感冒在阿拉贡这儿很流行。请您等一会儿，我去点上蜡烛，马上就回来，好向您这位解救苦难的救世主诉诉我的苦楚。” 她不等唐吉诃德回头就出去了。唐吉诃德一边静静地等候，一边思考着。想到这次意外的事情，他心绪纷乱，觉得这是糟糕的事情，很可能会破坏他对他的夫人的忠贞。唐吉诃德心想：“谁知道是不是诡计多端的魔鬼现在想用女佣来迷惑我，达到他们用女皇、王后、公爵夫人、侯爵夫人和伯爵夫人都没有达到的目的呢？我常听一些聪明人说，魔鬼常常是一计不成又施一计。谁知道在这夜深人静的时候，我会不会控制不住自己的欲望，同她睡觉，使我保持多年的忠贞付诸东流呢？遇到这种情况，免战比迎战好。不过，我也不必想入非非，这些全是我自己想的。像这样身穿白色长袍、高个子、戴眼镜的女佣，就是世界上最大的好色之徒也不会动心。难道世界上还有哪个女佣是细皮嫩肉吗？难道还有哪个女佣不是五大三粗、满脸皱纹而且还装模作样吗？让那群女佣都滚出去吧，她们真让人索然无味！据说，有个夫人做得挺不错，在她的客厅里放了两个女佣半身像，还戴着眼镜，靠着垫子，好像在那儿做活的样子，那样客厅里就好像真有了两个女佣似的，显得很有气派。” 唐吉诃德这么想着，从床上一跃而起，打算把门关上，不让女佣唐娜罗德里格斯进来。可是他走到门口，唐娜罗德里格斯已经点燃一支白蜡烛回来了。她迎面看见唐吉诃德近在眼前，身上依然裹着床单、纱布，头上还戴着帽子，又吓了一跳。她后退几步，说道： “您能让我放心吗，骑士大人？我觉得您下床来，好像不是正常举动。” “我正要问你呢，夫人。”唐吉诃德说，“我正要问你能否让我放心，保证我不受到骚扰或强暴？” “到底是谁让谁放心呀，骑士大人？”女佣问。 “是我求你让我放心，”唐吉诃德说，“因为我不是石头人，你也并非青铜心，况且现在不是上午十点，而是深更半夜，也许比深更半夜还晚些呢，而且这个地方很隐蔽，也许它会成为背信弃义的埃涅阿斯占有美丽而富有同情心的狄多的地方。不过，请您把手伸过来吧，夫人，我觉得我的良心和自重以及您那令人起敬的长袍，已能让我放心了。” 说完唐吉诃德吻了吻自己的手，然后又去拉女佣的手。女佣也以同样的动作还报唐吉诃德。 锡德·哈迈德在此有一段插话，说他向穆罕默德发誓，假如能让他欣赏到两个人手拉手走到床前那情景，他宁愿从他那两件最好的斗篷中拿出一件来捐献。 唐吉诃德上了床，唐娜罗德里格斯坐在一把椅子上，椅子与床有一定的距离。她没有摘眼镜，也没有吹灭蜡烛。唐吉诃德缩在床上，全身捂得严严实实，只露出一个脑袋。两人定下神以后，唐吉诃德首先开了口： “唐娜罗德里格斯夫人，现在您不妨把您内心的痛苦事都说出来，我一定仔细倾听，真心相助。” “从您慈善和蔼的面孔上，”女佣说，“我就断定一定会从您这儿得到这种诚恳的回答。现在的情况是，唐吉诃德大人，虽然您现在看见我坐在这把椅子上，身在阿拉贡，穿着一身受苦受罪的女佣的衣服，其实我是奥维多的阿斯图里亚斯人，我家和当地的许多豪门都有关系。可是我命运不佳，父母又不会过日子，结果稀里糊涂地就把家产丢尽了。后来父母把我送到了首都马德里。为了让我过上踏实日子，不再受更大的苦，他们把我放在一个贵夫人家做侍女。我不妨告诉您，若论做抽结①或白料加工②的活儿，这辈子也休想有谁比得过我。父母把我留在那人家干活，自己就回去了，大概过了没几年就死了。他们是非常善良的基督教徒。我孤身一人，靠那点儿可怜的工钱和深宫大院里的侍女所能得到的菲薄赏赐生活。这时候，她家的一个侍从爱上了我，是他主动找我的。那个人年纪不小了，满面胡须，人却挺精神。他是山上人，那气派简直像国王似的。我们并不掩饰我们的爱情，后来消息传到了女主人那儿。她为了避免让人说闲话，就让我们在教堂结了婚。结婚后我们有了一个女孩，可是我好运不长。我倒没有死于分娩，而是孩子出生后不久，我的丈夫就受了一场惊吓去世了。我现在给您讲讲这件事，我想您一定会感到惊讶。” ①缝纫式刺绣的花饰，在布上抽掉几根纱后分段结扎而成。 ②指在白色床单、罩布或内衣上做的针线活。 女佣伤心地哭起来，说道： “请您原谅，唐吉诃德大人，您也不用劝我。每当我想到我那夭折的丈夫，就泪水盈眶。上帝保佑，当时他把女主人带在那匹高大黝黑的骡子屁股上，可威风啦！那时候不像现在这样，贵夫人出门都是乘车或坐轿子。那时的贵夫人都是坐在侍从的鞍后。这件事我不能不讲，因为从这儿可以看出我那好丈夫的礼貌和办事认真的态度。他们刚走上马德里的圣地亚哥大街，那条街比较窄，迎面就走来一位京城的长官，前面有两个差役开路。我的丈夫一看到差役，就掉转骡子的缰绳，准备让路。可是坐在鞍后的女主人却低声说道：‘你干什么，倒霉鬼？你不知道我在这儿吗？’那长官很有礼貌，他勒住马，对我丈夫说：‘请您先过，大人，我应该给唐娜卡西尔达夫人让路。’我的女主人叫唐娜卡西尔达。 “可是我丈夫把帽子拿在手里，仍然坚持让那位长官先过。我的女主人不由得怒气冲天，从一个匣子里拿出一个大号别针或锥子来，刺进了我丈夫的腰。我丈夫一弯腰，连同女主人一起摔到了地上。女主人的两个仆役赶紧去扶女主人，那位长官和两个差役也跑来帮忙。瓜达拉哈拉大门①一下子就乱了，我是说，旁边那些无所事事的人一下子就乱了。女主人走了，我丈夫来到一家理发馆，说他的肚子被刺穿了。我丈夫的过分礼让一下子就传开了，连街上的孩子们都追着他起哄。就因为这个，再加上我丈夫有点儿近视，我的女主人把他辞退了。肯定是因为这事，我丈夫郁郁而死。我成了寡妇，无依无靠，还带着我女儿。我女儿慢慢长大了，漂亮得像朵花。后来，因为我善于做手工活是出了名的，我的女主人那时刚刚同公爵结婚，就把我也带到了阿拉贡这儿。我女儿也一起来了。她一天天长大了，多才多艺。她唱歌如百灵，宫廷舞跳得很轻盈，民间舞又跳得很豪放。她读书写字决不逊于学校的老师，算起帐来也十分精明。至于她多么讲卫生就不用说了，连流水都不如她干净。如果我没记错的话，她现在应该是十六岁五个月零三天了。 ①瓜达拉哈拉大门据说是游手好闲的人聚集的地方。 “公爵在离这儿不远有个村庄，那儿有个大富农，他的儿子后来爱上了我的女儿。实际上我还没明白是怎么回事，他们就结合了。富农的儿子声称要同我女儿结婚，其实是骗了我女儿，却又不想履行他的诺言。公爵知道这件事，我同他说过不止一次。我请公爵让那个富农的儿子同我女儿结婚，可是公爵充耳不闻，甚至不愿意听我说。原因就是那个富农很有钱，他借钱给公爵；公爵要借别人钱时，他又出面作保，所以公爵无论如何也不想得罪他。所以，大人，我想请您做主，无论是好言相劝还是武力相逼，总之要结束这种罪恶状况。大家都说您生来就是要铲除罪恶，拨乱反正，扶弱济贫的。我已经对您说过了。我女儿无依无靠，漂亮而又年轻，还有许多别的优点。无论是向上帝发誓还是凭良心而论，在我女主人身边的这么多姑娘里，没有一个能比得上她。我可以告诉您，大人，闪光的不一定都是金子。那个叫阿尔蒂西多拉的自以为很漂亮，可是她并不文静，倒有点疯劲儿，而且她身体也不怎么好，总是有那么一股让人讨厌的气味。谁要是在她身边，连一会儿也待不下去。还有公爵夫人……我不说了。 俗话说，隔墙有耳。” “天哪，唐娜罗德里格斯夫人，公爵夫人又怎么了？” “您既然这样恳求，”女佣说，“我就得据实相告了。唐吉诃德大人，您发现我的女主人公爵夫人的美貌之处了吗？她的脸光润滑腻，两频可谓雪肤冰肌，宛如日月相映；她走路轻盈风雅，所到之处都让人感到她秀美的仪容。您应该知道，这首先得感谢上帝，不过还有一点，那就是要归功于她的两条腿上的两个排泻口。医生说她身上全是坏水，而坏水都从那两个口子里排泄出来。” “圣母玛利亚啊！”唐吉诃德说，“我们的公爵夫人身上真会有这种排泄口吗？如果是别人说，我绝对不会相信，可这是唐娜罗德里格斯说的，也许真是这样。不过，从这种地方的排泄口里流出来的不应该是坏水，而应该是琥珀之液。现在我才真正相信，这种排泄口对于人体健康是十分重要的。” 唐吉诃德刚说完这几句话，就听见房间的门砰的一声打开了，唐娜罗德里格斯手中的蜡烛连吓带震地掉到了地上。可怜的女佣马上感到自己的脖子被两只手死死地扼住了，喘不过气来。同时，另一个人一声不吭地撩起女佣的裙子，用一个好像是女拖鞋的东西抽打女佣，而且打得很厉害。唐吉诃德虽然看着很心疼，却不敢从床上跳下来。他不知道那到底是什么东西，只好默不作声地蜷缩在床上，怕自己也遭到一顿打。他的这种担心也有道理。那两个打手把女佣打得浑身是伤，可女佣连呻吟都不敢。然后，那两个打手又来到唐吉诃德的床边，掀开床单，对唐吉诃德又拧又掐，唐吉诃德只好挥拳招架。奇怪的是他们都不出声。 这样打了半个小时，两个幽灵才出去。唐娜罗德里格斯放下裙子，为自己的不幸呻吟着，然后走出门，没有再和唐吉诃德说一句话。唐吉诃德被掐得浑身疼痛。他摸不着头脑，百思不得其解，很想知道是哪个恶毒的魔法师把他害成这样。咱们暂且不管他，先去看看桑乔·潘萨吧。这本小说安排得很好，桑乔正在叫咱们呢。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4669.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
