{"id":42183,"no":43,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 42","content":"With these words the captive held his peace, and Don Fernando said to him, “In truth, captain, the manner in which you have related this remarkable adventure has been such as befitted the novelty and strangeness of the matter. The whole story is curious and uncommon, and abounds with incidents that fill the hearers with wonder and astonishment; and so great is the pleasure we have found in listening to it that we should be glad if it were to begin again, even though to-morrow were to find us still occupied with the same tale.” And while he said this Cardenio and the rest of them offered to be of service to him in any way that lay in their power, and in words and language so kindly and sincere that the captain was much gratified by their good-will. In particular Don Fernando offered, if he would go back with him, to get his brother the marquis to become godfather at the baptism of Zoraida, and on his own part to provide him with the means of making his appearance in his own country with the credit and comfort he was entitled to. For all this the captive returned thanks very courteously, although he would not accept any of their generous offers. By this time night closed in, and as it did, there came up to the inn a coach attended by some men on horseback, who demanded accommodation; to which the landlady replied that there was not a hand’s breadth of the whole inn unoccupied. “Still, for all that,” said one of those who had entered on horseback, “room must be found for his lordship the Judge here.” At this name the landlady was taken aback, and said, “Senor, the fact is I have no beds; but if his lordship the Judge carries one with him, as no doubt he does, let him come in and welcome; for my husband and I will give up our room to accommodate his worship.” “Very good, so be it,” said the squire; but in the meantime a man had got out of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office and post he held, for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he wore showed that he was, as his servant said, a Judge of appeal. He led by the hand a young girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen years of age, and of such a high-bred air, so beautiful and so graceful, that all were filled with admiration when she made her appearance, and but for having seen Dorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida, who were there in the inn, they would have fancied that a beauty like that of this maiden’s would have been hard to find. Don Quixote was present at the entrance of the Judge with the young lady, and as soon as he saw him he said, “Your worship may with confidence enter and take your ease in this castle; for though the accommodation be scanty and poor, there are no quarters so cramped or inconvenient that they cannot make room for arms and letters; above all if arms and letters have beauty for a guide and leader, as letters represented by your worship have in this fair maiden, to whom not only ought castles to throw themselves open and yield themselves up, but rocks should rend themselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves down to give her a reception. Enter, your worship, I say, into this paradise, for here you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven your worship brings with you, here you will find arms in their supreme excellence, and beauty in its highest perfection.” The Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote, whom he scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figure than by his talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had a fresh surprise, when he saw opposite to him Luscinda, Dorothea, and Zoraida, who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the young lady, had come to see her and welcome her; Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the curate, however, greeted him in a more intelligible and polished style. In short, the Judge made his entrance in a state of bewilderment, as well with what he saw as what he heard, and the fair ladies of the inn gave the fair damsel a cordial welcome. On the whole he could perceive that all who were there were people of quality; but with the figure, countenance, and bearing of Don Quixote he was at his wits’ end; and all civilities having been exchanged, and the accommodation of the inn inquired into, it was settled, as it had been before settled, that all the women should retire to the garret that has been already mentioned, and that the men should remain outside as if to guard them; the Judge, therefore, was very well pleased to allow his daughter, for such the damsel was, to go with the ladies, which she did very willingly; and with part of the host’s narrow bed and half of what the Judge had brought with him, they made a more comfortable arrangement for the night than they had expected. The captive, whose heart had leaped within him the instant he saw the Judge, telling him somehow that this was his brother, asked one of the servants who accompanied him what his name was, and whether he knew from what part of the country he came. The servant replied that he was called the Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he had heard it said he came from a village in the mountains of Leon. From this statement, and what he himself had seen, he felt convinced that this was his brother who had adopted letters by his father’s advice; and excited and rejoiced, he called Don Fernando and Cardenio and the curate aside, and told them how the matter stood, assuring them that the judge was his brother. The servant had further informed him that he was now going to the Indies with the appointment of Judge of the Supreme Court of Mexico; and he had learned, likewise, that the young lady was his daughter, whose mother had died in giving birth to her, and that he was very rich in consequence of the dowry left to him with the daughter. He asked their advice as to what means he should adopt to make himself known, or to ascertain beforehand whether, when he had made himself known, his brother, seeing him so poor, would be ashamed of him, or would receive him with a warm heart. “Leave it to me to find out that,” said the curate; “though there is no reason for supposing, senor captain, that you will not be kindly received, because the worth and wisdom that your brother’s bearing shows him to possess do not make it likely that he will prove haughty or insensible, or that he will not know how to estimate the accidents of fortune at their proper value.” “Still,” said the captain, “I would not make myself known abruptly, but in some indirect way.” “I have told you already,” said the curate, “that I will manage it in a way to satisfy us all.” By this time supper was ready, and they all took their seats at the table, except the captive, and the ladies, who supped by themselves in their own room. In the middle of supper the curate said: “I had a comrade of your worship’s name, Senor Judge, in Constantinople, where I was a captive for several years, and that same comrade was one of the stoutest soldiers and captains in the whole Spanish infantry; but he had as large a share of misfortune as he had of gallantry and courage.” “And how was the captain called, senor?” asked the Judge. “He was called Ruy Perez de Viedma,” replied the curate, “and he was born in a village in the mountains of Leon; and he mentioned a circumstance connected with his father and his brothers which, had it not been told me by so truthful a man as he was, I should have set down as one of those fables the old women tell over the fire in winter; for he said his father had divided his property among his three sons and had addressed words of advice to them sounder than any of Cato’s . But I can say this much, that the choice he made of going to the wars was attended with such success, that by his gallant conduct and courage, and without any help save his own merit, he rose in a few years to be captain of infantry, and to see himself on the high-road and in position to be given the command of a corps before long; but Fortune was against him, for where he might have expected her favour he lost it, and with it his liberty, on that glorious day when so many recovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto. I lost mine at the Goletta, and after a variety of adventures we found ourselves comrades at Constantinople. Thence he went to Algiers, where he met with one of the most extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in the world.” Here the curate went on to relate briefly his brother’s adventure with Zoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an attentive hearing that he never before had been so much of a hearer. The curate, however, only went so far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were in the boat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the fair Moor were left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn what became of them, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to France by the Frenchmen. The captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all the curate said, and watching every movement of his brother, who, as soon as he perceived the curate had made an end of his story, gave a deep sigh and said with his eyes full of tears, “Oh, senor, if you only knew what news you have given me and how it comes home to me, making me show how I feel it with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of all my worldly wisdom and self-restraint! That brave captain that you speak of is my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than my other brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of arms, which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as your comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. I followed that of letters, in which God and my own exertions have raised me to the position in which you see me. My second brother is in Peru, so wealthy that with what he has sent to my father and to me he has fully repaid the portion he took with him, and has even furnished my father’s hands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity, while I too have been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming and creditable fashion, and so to attain my present standing. My father is still alive, though dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest son, and he prays God unceasingly that death may not close his eyes until he has looked upon those of his son; but with regard to him what surprises me is, that having so much common sense as he had, he should have neglected to give any intelligence about himself, either in his troubles and sufferings, or in his prosperity, for if his father or any of us had known of his condition he need not have waited for that miracle of the reed to obtain his ransom; but what now disquiets me is the uncertainty whether those Frenchmen may have restored him to liberty, or murdered him to hide the robbery. All this will make me continue my journey, not with the satisfaction in which I began it, but in the deepest melancholy and sadness. Oh dear brother! that I only knew where thou art now, and I would hasten to seek thee out and deliver thee from thy sufferings, though it were to cost me suffering myself! Oh that I could bring news to our old father that thou art alive, even wert thou the deepest dungeon of Barbary; for his wealth and my brother’s and mine would rescue thee thence! Oh beautiful and generous Zoraida, that I could repay thy good goodness to a brother! That I could be present at the new birth of thy soul, and at thy bridal that would give us all such happiness!” All this and more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news he had received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it, showing their sympathy with his sorrow. The curate, seeing, then, how well he had succeeded in carrying out his purpose and the captain’s wishes, had no desire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he rose from the table and going into the room where Zoraida was he took her by the hand, Luscinda, Dorothea, and the Judge’s daughter following her. The captain was waiting to see what the curate would do, when the latter, taking him with the other hand, advanced with both of them to where the Judge and the other gentlemen were and said, “Let your tears cease to flow, Senor Judge, and the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as you could desire, for you have before you your worthy brother and your good sister-in-law. He whom you see here is the Captain Viedma, and this is the fair Moor who has been so good to him. The Frenchmen I told you of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you may show the generosity of your kind heart.” The captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on his breast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way off but as soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms so closely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those present could not but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged, the emotion they showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less put down in writing. They told each other in a few words the events of their lives; they showed the true affection of brothers in all its strength; then the judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at her disposal; then he made his daughter embrace her, and the fair Christian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every eye. And there was Don Quixote observing all these strange proceedings attentively without uttering a word, and attributing the whole to chimeras of knight-errantry. Then they agreed that the captain and Zoraida should return with his brother to Seville, and send news to his father of his having been delivered and found, so as to enable him to come and be present at the marriage and baptism of Zoraida, for it was impossible for the Judge to put off his journey, as he was informed that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from Seville for New Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a great inconvenience to him. In short, everybody was well pleased and glad at the captive’s good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night were past, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it. Don Quixote offered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be attacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the great treasure of beauty the castle contained. Those who understood him returned him thanks for this service, and they gave the Judge an account of his extraordinary humour, with which he was not a little amused. Sancho Panza alone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to rest; and he of all was the one that made himself most comfortable, as he stretched himself on the trappings of his ass, which, as will be told farther on, cost him so dear. The ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others having disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don Quixote sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had promised. It happened, however, that a little before the approach of dawn a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it forced them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea, who had been awake, and by whose side Dona Clara de Viedma, for so the Judge’s daughter was called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who it was that sang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument. At one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in the courtyard, at another in the stable; and as they were all attention, wondering, Cardenio came to the door and said, “Listen, whoever is not asleep, and you will hear a muleteer’s voice that enchants as it chants.” “We are listening to it already, senor,” said Dorothea; on which Cardenio went away; and Dorothea, giving all her attention to it, made out the words of the song to be these: 俘虏讲到这儿不说话了。费尔南多对他说： “的确，上尉大人，您把您的经历讲得太生动了，仿佛历历在目。整个经历惊险曲折，实为世上罕见，使听者甚感惊奇，完全被吸引住了。我们都非常喜欢听。即使讲到明天早晨也讲不完，我们也愿意再从头听起。” 说完，费尔南多以及其他人都言真意切地表示愿意尽可能帮助他。俘虏被大家的一番好意深深感动了。费尔南多还问她是否愿意同自己一起回去。费尔南多可以让他的兄弟侯爵大人做索赖达洗礼的见证人，而费尔南多自己则将尽可能地安排俘虏堂堂正正地回到自己的家乡。俘虏对所有这些都很客气地表示感谢，不过他不能接受大家如此慷慨的帮助。 这时天黑了。一驾马车来到了客店，旁边还有几个骑马的人相随。他们要求在客店住宿。客店主妇说客店里一点儿地方也没有了。 几个骑马的人已经进了客店。其中一人说：“不管怎么样，总不能没有法官的地方。” 一听说是法官，客店主妇慌了，说道： “现在的问题是房间里没有被褥了。法官大人肯定带着铺盖吧，要是他随身带着，那就请进吧，我和我丈夫可以把我们的房间让给他。” “那就快点儿。”一个侍从说。 这时，那个人已经从马车里出来了。从他的服装上就可以看出他的身份。他穿的长袍表明他的确像他的侍从说的，是个法官。他手里还拉着一个看起来足有十六岁的女孩。她穿着一身旅行便装，显得俊秀、娇美，风姿如玉。谁看见她都会感到惊奇。如果不是因为他们在客店里见过多罗特亚、卢辛达和索赖达，一定会以为像她这样美丽的少女真是世上难觅。法官和那少女进来时，唐吉诃德正站在客店里。他看见法官就说： “您完全可以进入这座城堡休息，尽管它有些狭窄简陋。不过，世界上还没有什么地方狭窄简陋得容不下文官武士，若再有美女在前引路，就像您这位文官带着一位漂亮的少女，那就更是如此了。不仅城堡应该敞开大门，连岩石都应该让路，高山也要低头，以迎接他们。您快请进入这个乐园吧。如果您带的这位少女是天空，这里有与天空为伴的星月，这里有标准的武士和绝伦的美女。” 法官被唐吉诃德这番话弄得莫名其妙。他仔细看了看唐吉诃德，对唐吉诃德的装束深感诧异，不知说什么好。但更让他奇怪的是站在自己面前的卢辛达、多罗特亚和索赖达。她们听客店主妇说来了一位漂亮的少女，一起来看她迎接她。费尔南多、卡德尼奥和神甫对法官则是以礼相迎。法官对他看到和听到的这些深感不解，满心疑惑地进了客店。客店里的几个女人把那位少女迎了进去。不过，法官觉得这些旅客毕竟都是些有身份的人，惟独唐吉诃德的装束、表情和行为显得不正常。大家客气地相互问候，谈了一下客店的条件，然后仍然按照原来的安排，所有的女人都住在顶楼，男人们都住在外面，也算替她们看门。那个少女是法官的女儿，她高高兴兴地跟着几个女人进去了。法官也感到很满意。虽然只有店主那块窄小的床板，再加上法官自己的一点儿铺盖，但他还是觉得比自己预料的要好得多。 俘虏从看到法官的第一刻起，就开始心跳，总有一种预感，觉得那个法官就是他兄弟。他问法官的一个侍从，法官叫什么名字，是否知道法官是什么地方的人。侍从回答说，他是胡安·佩雷斯·德别德马硕士，听说他是莱昂山区某个地方的人。俘虏根据自己的观察，再这么一联系，断定那个法官就是自己的兄弟，当年他听从了父亲的吩咐，终于从文。俘虏既激动又高兴，把费尔南多、卡德尼奥和神甫叫到一旁，把他断定法官就是自己兄弟的事告诉了他们。他还说，侍从告诉他，法官已经被委派到美洲的墨西哥法庭任职。他还知道那个少女是法官的女儿，女孩的母亲生她时死了，把自己的嫁妆留给了法官和女儿，所以法官现在很有钱。俘虏还同他们商量如何与法官相认，是否应该先了解一下，如果他去相认，他的兄弟会不会因为他穷困潦倒，怕丢自己的面了而拒绝相认，或是欣喜若狂地与他团聚。 “让我去试探吧。”神甫说，“不过上尉大人，你不必想别的，你兄弟肯定会与你高高兴兴地相认。看他外表上那精明能干的样子，不会看不起你或不与你相认，他应该会处理人情世故。” “即使这样，”上尉说，“我想还是不要太唐突，而是婉转一些，让他与我相认。” “我告诉你们，我会安排得让我们大家都满意。”神甫说。 这时，晚饭准备好了，大家都坐到桌旁吃饭，只有俘虏和女人们除外，他们在各自的房间里吃饭。晚饭中，神甫说： “法官大人，我在君士坦丁堡有个与您同名的伙伴。我在君士坦丁堡做了几年俘虏，而那位伙伴是西班牙步兵的一位勇敢的战士和上尉。他非常勇敢，不过他也非常不幸。” “那位上尉全名叫什么，大人？”法官问。 “他叫鲁伊·佩雷斯·德别德马，”神甫说，“是莱昂山区某个地方的人。他对我讲过他父亲同他兄弟的事情。若不是像他这么诚实的人亲口对我说，我只会把它当成老人们冬天在炉火旁讲的那种故事。他对我说，他父亲把财产分给了自己的三个儿子，并且给他们以教诲，那教诲比卡顿的先见还英明。我只知道从军的那个儿子干得很出色，没过几年，就全凭自己的勇敢和努力，而不是靠任何人提挈，当上了陆军上尉，并且很可能提升为少校。不过他后来碰到了厄运，在莱潘多的那场战斗中，很多人获得了自由，他却失去了自由，失去了自己的佳运。我在戈利达被俘。几经周折，我们又在君士坦丁堡重逢了。后来他到了阿尔及尔，据我所知，在那儿遇到了一次可以算得上世界罕见的奇遇。” 接着，神甫又简单讲了一下索赖达同俘虏的事情，法官始终全神贯注地听着，他从未这样认真地听别人讲话。后来，神甫又讲到法国人抢掠了船上基督徒的东西，这位伙伴和美丽的摩尔女人陷入了贫困境地，以后就不知道他们的情况怎么样了，不知道他们究竟是到了西班牙还是被法国人带到法国去了。 上尉在一旁听神甫说话的时候，一直注意观察他兄弟的一举一动。法官见神甫已经讲完了，长长地叹了一口气，两眼噙着泪水说： “哎，大人，你大概不知道，你讲的这些事情与我有多大关系。我丢开了往日的持重，不禁泪眼潜然。你刚才说的那位勇敢的上尉是我哥哥。他比我和我弟弟都坚强，更具有远见卓识，选择了一条既光荣又高尚的从军道路，这就是你那个伙伴讲的近乎故事的经历中，我父亲指出的三条道路之一。我选择的是文职，靠上帝保佑和我的勤奋，才达到了今天这个地步。 “我的弟弟现在在秘鲁，过得很富裕。他寄给我父亲和我的钱远远超过了他带走的那些钱。他供养我父亲过原来那种大手大脚的生活，我也能够专心致志地完成我的学业，得到了我现在这个职位。我父亲还健在，他急于知道我哥哥的消息，望眼欲穿。他不断地祈求上帝，在他看到自己的儿子之前，不要让他瞑目。我也很奇怪，无论我哥哥饱尝苦难还是生活丰裕，为什么就想不起把自己的消息告诉我父亲呢？如果我父亲或我们兄弟俩当中的一个知道了他的消息，他就不必靠那根神奇的竹竿赎身了。不过，现在最让我担心的就是那些法国人究竟是放了他，还是为了掩盖他们的罪恶杀了他。这么一想，我再赶路时就不会像启程时那样高高兴兴了，只能是忧心忡仲。我的好兄弟呀，如果有人知道你现在何方，我愿历尽千辛万苦，甚至可以抛弃我的一切，也要去寻找你，解救你。如果当时有人告诉我父亲，说你还活着，即使你被关在贝韦利亚地牢的最底层，他也会不惜他和我们兄弟的财产把你救出来。噢，美丽豁达的索赖达，我们如何才能报答你对我哥哥的恩情啊！当你灵魂再生的时候，我们真想参加你们的婚礼，我们大家该多么高兴啊！” 法官听说了哥哥的消息后，满怀深情地说了上面这番话。听见他说这话的人都不由自主地与他共同伤感。神甫见自己的意图以及上尉的期望都实现了，不想让大家都跟着伤心，就从桌旁站起来，来到索赖达待的房间，拉着她的手走了出来。卢辛达、多罗特亚和法官的女儿也都跟着出来了。上尉正等着看神甫干什么，神甫又过来拉起他的手，领着两人来到法官和其他客人面前，说： “您停止流泪吧，法官大人，现在您完全如愿以偿了。现在，站在您面前的就是您的哥哥和您的嫂子。这位就是德别德马上尉，那一位就是对他施以恩德的摩尔美人。我说那些法国人把他们害苦了，而你正好可以对他们解囊相助。” 上尉过来拥抱他的弟弟。法官把双手放在上尉胸前，以便离得远一点儿端详他。法官终于认出了自己的哥哥，马上紧紧拥抱住他，眼里流出了幸福的泪水。其他在场的人也不禁为之欷歔。兄弟俩说的话、诉的情恐怕是人们难以想象的，就更不要说用文字写出来了。 兄弟俩互相简单介绍了自己的情况，看上去真是情同手足。法官又拥抱了索赖达，并表示要将自己的家产供她使用，还让自己的女儿拥抱了索赖达。基督美女和摩尔美女拥抱在一起，不禁又泪湿衣衫。唐吉诃德仔细看着这一切，一言不发，他觉得这是奇怪的事情，是游侠骑士的幻觉。大家商定上尉和索赖达与法官一起回到塞维利亚去，把碰到上尉和上尉已经获得自由的消息告诉上尉的父亲，还要让他尽可能出席他们的婚礼和索赖达的洗礼。法官恐怕赶不上了，他还得继续赶路。有消息说，一个月后塞维利亚有条船到新西班牙①去。总之，大家都为俘虏的好运高兴。此时，已经夜过三更，大家决定休息，唐吉诃德自告奋勇去看夺城堡，以免某个巨人或坏蛋觊觎城堡里的美人跑来捣乱。凡是认识唐吉诃德的人都向他表示感谢，并且把他的怪诞举动告诉了法官。法官也很高兴地同意了。只有桑乔对这么晚才睡觉感到很失望。他躺到驴的鞍具上，比别人睡得都舒服。不过，后来他可为这副鞍具吃了不少苦头，这在下面会谈到。女人们在她们的房间里睡着了，其他人也都将就着躺下了。唐吉诃德走出客店，按照自己答应的话，为他的城堡站岗放哨。 ①此处指美洲的西班牙殖民地。 天快亮的时候，女人们的耳边传来一阵悠扬的歌声。大家都竖起耳朵听着，特别是多罗特亚，她早已醒了。多罗特亚旁边睡的是法官的女儿克拉拉·德别德马。没人猜得出究竟是谁唱得这么好。这是一个人在独唱，没有任何乐器伴奏。有时似乎是在院子里唱，有时又像在马厩里唱。大家正莫名其妙地听着，卡德尼奥来到房间门口，说： “如果谁还没睡着，就听听，有个年轻的骡夫在唱歌，唱得非常动听。” “我们已经听到了，大人。”多罗特亚说。 卡德尼奥听到这话就走了。多罗特业则全神贯注地听着。 她听出歌词是下面的话。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4610.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
