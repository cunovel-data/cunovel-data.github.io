{"id":42185,"no":45,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 44","content":"So loud, in fact, were the shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlord opening the gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ran to see who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined him. Maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry, suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone seeing her, untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and down he came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers, who approaching asked him what was the matter with him that he shouted so. He without replying a word took the rope off his wrist, and rising to his feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, put his lance in rest, and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at a half-gallop exclaiming: “Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided my lady the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so, I give him the lie, challenge him and defy him to single combat.” The newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote; but the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and not to mind him as he was out of his senses. They then asked the landlord if by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had come to that inn, one dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an appearance, describing that of Dona Clara’s lover. The landlord replied that there were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person they were inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which the Judge had come, said, “He is here no doubt, for this is the coach he is following: let one of us stay at the gate, and the rest go in to look for him; or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the inn, lest he should escape over the wall of the yard.” “So be it,” said another; and while two of them went in, one remained at the gate and the other made the circuit of the inn; observing all which, the landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all these precautions, though he understood they were looking for the youth whose description they had given him. It was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as in consequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake and up, but particularly Dona Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able to sleep but badly that night, the one from agitation at having her lover so near her, the other from curiosity to see him. Don Quixote, when he saw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to his challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise, when he had plighted his word and faith not to involve himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he was pledged, he would have attacked the whole of them, and would have made them return an answer in spite of themselves. But considering that it would not become him, nor be right, to begin any new emprise until he had established Micomicona in her kingdom, he was constrained to hold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the proceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth they were seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer, without a thought of anyone coming in search of him, much less finding him. The man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, “It becomes you well indeed, Senor Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed in which I find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared you.” The youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held him, but presently recognised him as one of his father’s servants, at which he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or utter a word; while the servant went on to say, “There is nothing for it now, Senor Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless it is your wish that my lord, your father, should take his departure for the other world, for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he is in at your absence.” “But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this dress?” said Don Luis. “It was a student to whom you confided your intentions,” answered the servant, “that disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he saw your father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of his servants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, better pleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able to restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you.” “That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,” returned Don Luis. “What can you please or heaven order,” said the other, “except to agree to go back? Anything else is impossible.” All this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at whose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report what had taken place to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this time dressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth as “Don,” and what words had passed, and how he wanted him to return to his father, which the youth was unwilling to do. With this, and what they already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him, they all felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was, and even to help him if it was attempted to employ force against him; so they hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his servant. Dorothea at this instant came out of her room, followed by Dona Clara all in a tremor; and calling Cardenio aside, she told him in a few words the story of the musician and Dona Clara, and he at the same time told her what had happened, how his father’s servants had come in search of him; but in telling her so, he did not speak low enough but that Dona Clara heard what he said, at which she was so much agitated that had not Dorothea hastened to support her she would have fallen to the ground. Cardenio then bade Dorothea return to her room, as he would endeavour to make the whole matter right, and they did as he desired. All the four who had come in quest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him, urging him to return and console his father at once and without a moment’s delay. He replied that he could not do so on any account until he had concluded some business in which his life, honour, and heart were at stake. The servants pressed him, saying that most certainly they would not return without him, and that they would take him away whether he liked it or not. “You shall not do that,” replied Don Luis, “unless you take me dead; though however you take me, it will be without life.” By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute, but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the Judge, the curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered there was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer. Cardenio being already acquainted with the young man’s story, asked the men who wanted to take him away, what object they had in seeking to carry off this youth against his will. “Our object,” said one of the four, “is to save the life of his father, who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman’s disappearance.” Upon this Don Luis exclaimed, “There is no need to make my affairs public here; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none of you shall compel me.” “Reason will compel your worship,” said the man, “and if it has no power over you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for, and what it is our duty to do.” “Let us hear what the whole affair is about,” said the Judge at this; but the man, who knew him as a neighbour of theirs, replied, “Do you not know this gentleman, Senor Judge? He is the son of your neighbour, who has run away from his father’s house in a dress so unbecoming his rank, as your worship may perceive.” The judge on this looked at him more carefully and recognised him, and embracing him said, “What folly is this, Senor Don Luis, or what can have been the cause that could have induced you to come here in this way, and in this dress, which so ill becomes your condition?” Tears came into the eyes of the young man, and he was unable to utter a word in reply to the Judge, who told the four servants not to be uneasy, for all would be satisfactorily settled; and then taking Don Luis by the hand, he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having come there. But while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gate of the inn, the cause of which was that two of the guests who had passed the night there, seeing everybody busy about finding out what it was the four men wanted, had conceived the idea of going off without paying what they owed; but the landlord, who minded his own affairs more than other people’s , caught them going out of the gate and demanded his reckoning, abusing them for their dishonesty with such language that he drove them to reply with their fists, and so they began to lay on him in such a style that the poor man was forced to cry out, and call for help. The landlady and her daughter could see no one more free to give aid than Don Quixote, and to him the daughter said, “Sir knight, by the virtue God has given you, help my poor father, for two wicked men are beating him to a mummy.” To which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied, “Fair damsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for I am debarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have brought to a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that which I can do for you is what I will now mention: run and tell your father to stand his ground as well as he can in this battle, and on no account to allow himself to be vanquished, while I go and request permission of the Princess Micomicona to enable me to succour him in his distress; and if she grants it, rest assured I will relieve him from it.” “Sinner that I am,” exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; “before you have got your permission my master will be in the other world.” “Give me leave, senora, to obtain the permission I speak of,” returned Don Quixote; “and if I get it, it will matter very little if he is in the other world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same world can do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those who shall have sent him there that you will be more than moderately satisfied;” and without saying anything more he went and knelt before Dorothea, requesting her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be pleased to grant him permission to aid and succour the castellan of that castle, who now stood in grievous jeopardy. The princess granted it graciously, and he at once, bracing his buckler on his arm and drawing his sword, hastened to the inn-gate, where the two guests were still handling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he reached the spot he stopped short and stood still, though Maritornes and the landlady asked him why he hesitated to help their master and husband. “I hesitate,” said Don Quixote, “because it is not lawful for me to draw sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire Sancho to me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business.” Thus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively exchange of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord and to the wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who were furious when they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the hard treatment their master, husband and father was undergoing. But let us leave him there; for he will surely find some one to help him, and if not, let him suffer and hold his tongue who attempts more than his strength allows him to do; and let us go back fifty paces to see what Don Luis said in reply to the Judge whom we left questioning him privately as to his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed. To which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart was troubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made answer: “Senor, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when, through heaven’s will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Dona Clara, your daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her the mistress of my will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no impediment, this very day she shall become my wife. For her I left my father’s house, and for her I assumed this disguise, to follow her whithersoever she may go, as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the pole-star. She knows nothing more of my passion than what she may have learned from having sometimes seen from a distance that my eyes were filled with tears. You know already, senor, the wealth and noble birth of my parents, and that I am their sole heir; if this be a sufficient inducement for you to venture to make me completely happy, accept me at once as your son; for if my father, influenced by other objects of his own, should disapprove of this happiness I have sought for myself, time has more power to alter and change things, than human will.” With this the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, after hearing him, was astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at the manner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret of his heart, as at the position in which he found himself, not knowing what course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected. All the answer, therefore, he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy for the present, and arrange with his servants not to take him back that day, so that there might be time to consider what was best for all parties. Don Luis kissed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with his tears, in a way that would have touched a heart of marble, not to say that of the Judge, who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how advantageous the marriage would be to his daughter; though, were it possible, he would have preferred that it should be brought about with the consent of the father of Don Luis, who he knew looked for a title for his son. The guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by persuasion and Don Quixote’s fair words more than by threats, they had paid him what he demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waiting for the end of the conversation with the Judge and their master’s decision, when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber, from whom Don Quixote had taken Mambrino’s helmet, and Sancho Panza the trappings of his ass in exchange for those of his own, should at this instant enter the inn; which said barber, as he led his ass to the stable, observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing something or other belonging to the pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and made bold to attack Sancho, exclaiming, “Ho, sir thief, I have caught you! hand over my basin and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that you robbed me of.” Sancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abuse poured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with the other gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The barber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in the pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that everyone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant. “Here, in the name of the king and justice!” he cried, “this thief and highwayman wants to kill me for trying to recover my property.” “You lie,” said Sancho, “I am no highwayman; it was in fair war my master Don Quixote won these spoils.” Don Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his squire’s stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time forth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub him a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling sure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him. In the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said, “Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death, and I know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass in the stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not fit him like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day I was robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin, never yet handselled, that would fetch a crown any day.” At this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and interposing between the two, and separating them, he placed the pack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was established, and said, “Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly the error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin which was, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from him in air war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful possession. With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I may tell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to strip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon’s steed, and with it adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took it; and as to its having been changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give no explanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run, Sancho my son, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.” “Egad, master,” said Sancho, “if we have no other proof of our case than what your worship puts forward, Mambrino’s helmet is just as much a basin as this good fellow’s caparison is a pack-saddle.” “Do as I bid thee,” said Don Quixote; “it cannot be that everything in this castle goes by enchantment.” Sancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him, and when Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said: “Your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that this is a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by the order of chivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I took from him, without anything added to or taken from it.” “There is no doubt of that,” said Sancho, “for from the time my master won it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when he let loose those unlucky men in chains; and if had not been for this basin-helmet he would not have come off over well that time, for there was plenty of stone-throwing in that affair.” 唐吉诃德一阵喊叫，吓得店主赶紧打开了客店的门，慌慌张张地跑出来看究竟是谁这么喊叫。客店外面的几个人也跑了过来。丑女仆也被这阵喊声惊醒，马上就猜想到是怎么回事了。她立刻跑到堆稻草的房子里，神不知鬼不觉地把拴着唐吉诃德的缰绳解开了，结果唐吉诃德在众目睽睽之下摔到了地上。他刚落地，店主和几个旅客就问他是怎么回事，为什么这么拼命地喊叫。唐吉诃德一句话也不说，解开手腕上的活结，从地上站起来，骑上罗西南多，抓起皮盾，拿起长矛，在外面骑马跑了一阵，又不紧不慢地蹓回来，说道： “谁敢说我被魔法定住是理所当然？只要我的女主人米科米科娜公主允许，我就要驳斥他，向他挑战，跟他展开一场殊死的战斗！” 几个旅客听了唐吉诃德的话很惊奇。店主告诉他们唐吉诃德是什么样的人，他现在神智不正常，不要理会他，大家才不感到奇怪了。 几个旅客又问店主，是否有个十五岁的男孩来过这个客店，那个孩子打扮成骡夫的样子，又如此这番形容了一阵，说的就是克拉拉的情人那样子。店主说客店里每天有很多人，他没注意到是否有他们打听的那个人。可是有个旅客看到了法官的马车，就说： “他肯定在这儿，这就是据说他追踪的那辆马车。咱们一个人留在门口，其他人进去找，最好有个人在客店周围转一转，免得他从墙头上跳出去。” “就这么办。”其中一人说。 两人进了客店，一个留在门口，还有一个在客店周围转悠。这一切店主都看在眼里。他虽然知道他们要找的是那个男孩，却不明白他们为什么行动要如此周密。 这时天已经亮了，再加上唐吉诃德刚才的吵闹，客店里的人全醒了，也都起床了。特别是克拉拉和多罗特亚，一个由于情人就在附近而受了惊吓，另一个由于急于看到这个孩子，两个人那天晚上都没有睡好。 唐吉诃德见四个旅客中没有一个把他放在眼里，也不向他应战，恼怒极了。如果他能在他的骑士规则里找到规定，说明游侠骑士在完成他承诺的事情之前去做另一件事也属合法，他早就向那几个人进攻了，不管他们愿意与否，都得应战。不过，他还是觉得在帮助米科米科娜公主重建她的王国之前又开始另一项新的事业不妥，因此只好默不作声，看这几个旅客紧锣密鼓到底干些什么。一个旅客果然找到了他们要找的那个男孩。那个男孩正睡在一个骡夫身旁。他没有想到有人会找他，更没想到居然会找到他。那个旅客抓住了男孩的胳膊，说： “唐路易斯少爷，看来你这身打扮的确符合你的身份，而你现在睡的这张床也说明你的母亲如何娇惯了你。” 男孩揉了揉惺忪的睡眼，慢慢打量着抓住他胳膊的人，待他认出是他家的佣人后，吓了一大跳，竟半天说不出话来。佣人接着说： “现在没别的办法，唐路易斯少爷，只有耐心点，转身回家去，假如你不愿意让你的父亲即我的主人到极乐世界去的话。你的出走给你父亲带来的痛苦已经让他悲痛欲绝了。” “可是，”唐路易斯问，“我父亲怎么知道我走了这条路，穿了这身衣服呢？” “是那个学生说的，”佣人说，“你把你的想法告诉了他，他见你父亲想念你的样子，实在于心不忍。于是，你父亲就派我们四个佣人来找你。我们都在这里听你吩咐，而且很高兴事情比我们想象的顺利。我们可以带你回去，让你见到那双如此疼爱你的眼睛。” “这要看我愿意不愿意，以及老天如何安排了。”唐路易斯说。 “你除了同意回去之外，还想干什么？老天还能怎么安排呢？其他事情都是不可能的。” 两人这番对话被旁边那个骡夫全听到了。他站起身来，去找费尔南多和卡德尼奥，把这事对他们和其他人说了。此时大家都已起床。骡夫告诉他们，那个人如何称那个男孩为“少爷”，想把他带回他父亲家去，而那个男孩不愿意回去。大家听到这些，刚才又领教过他那副天生的好嗓子，就更想知道他到底是什么人了。此外，如果有人强迫他做什么事情，大家还可以帮他一把。于是大家来到孩子跟前。那个孩子还在那儿同佣人争辩。 多罗特亚这时走出房间，后面跟着失魂落魄的克拉拉。多罗特亚把卡德尼奥叫到一旁，向他简单叙述了歌唱家和克拉拉的事情。卡德尼奥也把那男孩父亲家的佣人来找他的事情告诉了多罗特亚。他说话的声音不算小，克拉拉全听到了。她急得不知如何是好，若不是多罗将亚赶紧过去扶住她，她就跌倒了。卡德尼奥让她们先回房间去，他来想办法。于是她们回房间去了。 四个来找孩子的佣人此时正围着男孩，劝他立刻回去安慰他的父亲。那个男孩说，如果不完成一件与他的性命、名誉和灵魂攸关的事情，他无论如何也不会回去。几个佣人也毫不让步，说他们绝不会让他留在这里，不管他愿意不愿意，都得把他带回去。 “你们除非带走我的尸体，”唐路易斯说，“否则你们不可能把我带走。随便你们用什么方式把我带走，可带走的只能是个死人。” 这时客店里的很多人都跑来看他们争吵，其中有卡德尼奥，费尔南多和他的伙伴，法官，神甫，理发师和唐吉诃德。唐吉诃德觉得没有必要再守卫城堡了。卡德尼德已经知道了这个男孩的事情，就问那几个想把男孩带走的人，为什么要强迫他回去。 “为了挽救他父亲的生命，”一个佣人说，“由于这个孩子出走，他父亲差点儿急死。” 唐路易斯说： “没必要在这儿讲我的事情。我是自由人，我愿意回去就回去。如果我不想回去，谁也别想强迫我。” “做事得讲道理，”佣人说，“如果你的道理不充分，而我们的道理充分，就得按照我们说的去做。我们有责任这样做。” “让我们看看这到底是怎么回事。”法官这时说道。 佣人和法官是邻居，认识他。佣人说： “您难道没认出他吗，法官大人？这个小伙子就是您的邻居的儿子。他从他父亲家跑出来，您看看，还穿着这身与他的身份根本不符的破衣服。” 法官仔细看了看那男孩，认出了他。法官抱住年轻人，说： “你耍什么孩子气，唐路易斯少爷？有什么大不了的事，值得你跑到这儿来，还穿着这身破衣服，就像他说的，与你的身份太不相称了。” 男孩眼里涌出了泪水，对法官的问话一句也说不出来。法官叫四个佣人先冷静一下，一切都会好的。他拉着男孩的手，把他叫到一旁，问他到底来干什么。法官正在问男孩的时候，忽听得客店门口有人大声喊叫。原来有两个当晚留宿的客人见大家都在忙于弄清四个佣人的来意，就想趁乱不付帐溜走。可是店主更关心的是他的生意，而不是别人的闲事，所以在那两个人刚走出客店门时抓住了他们，让他们付钱，而且还对他们恶语相讥，惹得那两个人挥拳相报。他们开始殴打店主，店主只得大声呼救。 店主妇和她女儿见只有唐吉诃德有空去救店主，于是那女孩便对唐吉诃德说： “骑士大人，请您看在上帝的份上行行善，去救我那可怜的父亲吧，那两个坏蛋正在狠命地折磨他呢。” 唐吉诃德却一字一句、无动于衷地说道： “美丽的姑娘，现在我无法考虑你的请求，因为我在完成我承诺的一件事情之前，不能够参与其他事情。现在我可以为你效劳的只能是：你赶紧去告诉你父亲，让他在这场战斗中一定要顶住，无论如何也不能败下阵来。与此同时，我去求米科米科娜公主允许我解救危难。如果她允许，你放心，我一定会把他救出来。” “我的天啊！”丑女仆在一旁说，“等您先取得了您说的这个允许，我的主人早就到极乐世界去了。” “请让我先去求得这个允许，姑娘。”唐吉诃德说，“只要我得到了这个允许，他就是到了极乐世界也没关系，我还可以把他从那儿救出来，即使这边的世界反对也没用；或者，至少我还可以向把他送到极乐世界去的人报仇，你也会由此感到宽慰。” 唐吉诃德没有再说什么，跪倒在多罗特亚面前，以游侠骑士的语言请求她恩准自己去解救陷入严重危难的城堡长官。公主慨然应允。于是唐吉诃德手持皮盾，拿起剑，来到客店门口。两个客人正在那儿继续殴打店主。可是，唐吉诃德刚赶到门口就站住不动了。丑女仆问他为什么站住不动，怎么还不赶快去救她的主人，店主妇也问他为什么不去救她的丈夫。 “我站住是因为我持剑进攻侍从是非法的。”唐吉诃德说，“你们去叫我的侍从桑乔到这儿来，保护长官和为长官报仇都是他的事。” 这些事情就发生在客店门口，拳头正重重地打在店主的脸上和身上，把店主打得真不轻，把丑女仆、店主妇和她女儿也气得够呛。她们对唐吉诃德的怯懦，对她们各自的主人、丈夫和父亲的遭殃简直绝望了。 咱们暂且先不说店主吧，反正会有人救他。如果没人救他，那也只好让他忍耐着受罪吧，全怪他不自量力，粗暴无礼。咱们向后退五十步，看看唐路易斯如何回答法官的问话吧。刚才我们谈到法官问唐路易斯为什么走到这儿来了，而且穿的是这么破的衣服。小伙子紧紧拉住法官的手，似乎在忍受心灵的极大痛楚，泪如泉涌地说道： “我只能对您说，大人，自从天意让我们成为邻居，我看到了您的女儿，我的意中人克拉拉的第一刻起，我的心就被她征服了。假如您，一位真正的大人，我的父辈，不反对的话，我今天就想同她结婚。我为她离开了我父亲的家，为她换上了这身打扮，为的是无论她走到哪儿，我都要跟随她，就好似箭追逐靶，海员望北斗。她并不知道我的心思，只是有几次远远地望见我眼含泪水才有所领悟。大人，您知道我父亲的财富和地位，还知道我是唯一的继承人。如果您觉得这足以让您成全我们的话，您现在就可以把我当您的儿子看待。如果我父亲另有打算，不满意我自己选择的幸福，时间可以超越人的意志改变事物。” 多情少年说到这儿止住了话语。法官听了这些话，颇感意外，不知所措。这不仅是由于唐路易斯这种大胆的表露，而且还由于他不知道该如何对待这件突如其来又意想不到的事情。他只是让唐路易斯先冷静一下，并且稳住那几个佣人，让他们不要当天就赶回去，现在还需要时间把事情考虑得周全一些。唐路易斯坚持吻了法官的手，泪水也洒到了他的手上。别说是法官，就是石头心肠的人见此也会心软。法官知道这桩婚事对自己的女儿很有好处。不过他办事慎重，如果可能的话，他想征得唐路易斯的父亲同意。他听说唐路易斯的父亲正在为自己的儿子谋取爵位。 此时客人和店主已经不打架了。经过唐吉诃德的好言相劝，而不是恶语威胁，客人已经如数把钱付给了店主。唐路易斯的几个佣人正在等待法官同唐路易斯的谈话结果，以及唐路易斯的最后决定。可是魔鬼偏偏不闲着，这时候让那个被唐吉诃德抢走了曼布里诺头盔的理发师进了客店。桑乔当时曾把理发师那头驴的鞍子抢了过来，换到自己那头驴身上。理发师把他的驴牵到马厩去，看到桑乔正为他的驴准备驮鞍。理发师认出了那驮鞍，立刻奋不顾身地向桑乔冲去，嘴里还说道： “嘿，你这个盗贼，我终于抓住你了！还我铜盆、驮鞍和所有鞍具！” 桑乔突然受到攻击，还听到有人在咒骂。他一只手抓住驮鞍，另一只手挥拳向理发师的脸打去，立刻把他打得满嘴是血。可理发师并没有因此就放开抓住驮鞍的手，反而大声呼叫起来。客店里的所有人都循着这打斗的声音赶来了。理发师喊道： “求国王和正义主持公道！这个拦路打劫的强盗抢了我的东西，还想要我的命！” “你胡说！”桑乔说，“我才不是强盗呢。这是我的主人唐吉诃德在那场出色的战斗中缴获的战利品。” 唐吉诃德就在旁边，得意洋洋地看着他的侍从能攻善守，并且从此觉得他是个有用的人，心里打算着一有机会就要封他为骑士。唐吉诃德觉得桑乔肯定会很好地发扬骑士精神。理发师吵闹着说道： “各位大人，这个驮鞍是属于我的，这就好像我肯定会魂归故里一样确凿无疑。我对它非常熟悉，就好像它是我生的一样。我的驴就在牲口棚里，我不会说谎，不信你们就去试试，看看它是不是正好配那头驴。如果不是，我就是混蛋。还有，他们抢走我的驮鞍那天，还抢走了我的一个新铜盆，没有用过的。那个铜盆能值一个埃斯库多。” 唐吉诃德这时忍不住要说话了。他来到两个人中间，把他们分开，又把驮鞍放在地上，待他们把事情辩出个究竟再做处置。他说道： “诸位可以清楚地看到，这位忠实的侍从分明弄错了。他称之为铜盆的这个东西，过去、现在和将来都是曼布里诺的头盔。这是我在一次出色的战斗中从他那儿夺取的，并且合理合法地拥有了它。至于那个驮鞍，我就不说什么了，我只知道我的侍从桑乔曾请求我允许他夺取这个败阵的胆小鬼的马具，用它来装备他的马匹。我允许了，他就把马具夺了过来。至于马具为什么会变成驮鞍，我只能给一个很简单的解释：这是游侠骑士常遇到的那种蜕变。为了证明这一点，桑乔，你把这位老兄说成是铜盆的那个头盔拿到这儿来。” “天哪，大人，”桑乔说，“除了说这个盆是什么马里诺①的头盔，这个人说的驮鞍是马具，您就没有别的证据说明我们的意思吗？” ①桑乔在这里又把曼布里诺说错成马里诺了。 “你照我的吩咐去做，”唐吉诃德说，“并不是这座城堡里的所有东西都受魔法的制约。” 桑乔把铜盆拿来了。唐吉诃德马上把它拿在手里，说道： “诸位看看，这位侍从有什么脸说这是个铜盆，而不是我说的头盔呢？我以骑士界的名义发誓，这就是我从他那儿夺取的头盔，上面的东西一点儿不多，一点儿不少。” “这肯定没错，”桑乔这时说，“自从我的主人打了那次胜仗以后，只打过一次仗，就是释放了那批带锁链的倒霉鬼那次。要不是这个盆儿盔，那次可就麻烦了，当时石头就像扑天盖地一般地打过来呢。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4612.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
