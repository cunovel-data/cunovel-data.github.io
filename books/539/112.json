{"id":42252,"no":112,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 58","content":"When Don Quixote saw himself in open country, free, and relieved from the attentions of Altisidora, he felt at his ease, and in fresh spirits to take up the pursuit of chivalry once more; and turning to Sancho he said, “Freedom, Sancho, is one of the most precious gifts that heaven has bestowed upon men; no treasures that the earth holds buried or the sea conceals can compare with it; for freedom, as for honour, life may and should be ventured; and on the other hand, captivity is the greatest evil that can fall to the lot of man. I say this, Sancho, because thou hast seen the good cheer, the abundance we have enjoyed in this castle we are leaving; well then, amid those dainty banquets and snow-cooled beverages I felt as though I were undergoing the straits of hunger, because I did not enjoy them with the same freedom as if they had been mine own; for the sense of being under an obligation to return benefits and favours received is a restraint that checks the independence of the spirit. Happy he, to whom heaven has given a piece of bread for which he is not bound to give thanks to any but heaven itself!”\\n\\n “For all your worship says,” said Sancho, “it is not becoming that there should he no thanks on our part for two hundred gold crowns that the duke’s majordomo has given me in a little purse which I carry next my heart, like a warming plaster or comforter, to meet any chance calls; for we shan’t always find castles where they’ll entertain us; now and then we may light upon roadside inns where they’ll cudgel us.”\\n\\n In conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuing their journey, when, after they had gone a little more than half a league, they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched upon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner. They had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some objects under them, standing upright or lying flat, and arranged at intervals. Don Quixote approached the diners, and, saluting them courteously first, he asked them what it was those cloths covered. “Senor,” answered one of the party, “under these cloths are some images carved in relief intended for a retablo we are putting up in our village; we carry them covered up that they may not be soiled, and on our shoulders that they may not be broken.”\\n\\n “With your good leave,” said Don Quixote, “I should like to see them; for images that are carried so carefully no doubt must be fine ones.”\\n\\n “I should think they were!” said the other; “let the money they cost speak for that; for as a matter of fact there is not one of them that does not stand us in more than fifty ducats; and that your worship may judge; wait a moment, and you shall see with your own eyes;” and getting up from his dinner he went and uncovered the first image, which proved to be one of Saint George on horseback with a serpent writhing at his feet and the lance thrust down its throat with all that fierceness that is usually depicted. The whole group was one blaze of gold, as the saying is. On seeing it Don Quixote said, “That knight was one of the best knights-errant the army of heaven ever owned; he was called Don Saint George, and he was moreover a defender of maidens. Let us see this next one.”\\n\\n The man uncovered it, and it was seen to be that of Saint Martin on his horse, dividing his cloak with the beggar. The instant Don Quixote saw it he said, “This knight too was one of the Christian adventurers, but I believe he was generous rather than valiant, as thou mayest perceive, Sancho, by his dividing his cloak with the beggar and giving him half of it; no doubt it was winter at the time, for otherwise he would have given him the whole of it, so charitable was he.”\\n\\n “It was not that, most likely,” said Sancho, “but that he held with the proverb that says, ‘For giving and keeping there’s need of brains.’”\\n\\n Don Quixote laughed, and asked them to take off the next cloth, underneath which was seen the image of the patron saint of the Spains seated on horseback, his sword stained with blood, trampling on Moors and treading heads underfoot; and on seeing it Don Quixote exclaimed, “Ay, this is a knight, and of the squadrons of Christ! This one is called Don Saint James the Moorslayer, one of the bravest saints and knights the world ever had or heaven has now.”\\n\\n They then raised another cloth which it appeared covered Saint Paul falling from his horse, with all the details that are usually given in representations of his conversion. When Don Quixote saw it, rendered in such lifelike style that one would have said Christ was speaking and Paul answering, “This,” he said, “was in his time the greatest enemy that the Church of God our Lord had, and the greatest champion it will ever have; a knight-errant in life, a steadfast saint in death, an untiring labourer in the Lord’s vineyard, a teacher of the Gentiles, whose school was heaven, and whose instructor and master was Jesus Christ himself.”\\n\\n There were no more images, so Don Quixote bade them cover them up again, and said to those who had brought them, “I take it as a happy omen, brothers, to have seen what I have; for these saints and knights were of the same profession as myself, which is the calling of arms; only there is this difference between them and me, that they were saints, and fought with divine weapons, and I am a sinner and fight with human ones. They won heaven by force of arms, for heaven suffereth violence; and I, so far, know not what I have won by dint of my sufferings; but if my Dulcinea del Toboso were to be released from hers, perhaps with mended fortunes and a mind restored to itself I might direct my steps in a better path than I am following at present.”\\n\\n “May God hear and sin be deaf,” said Sancho to this.\\n\\n The men were filled with wonder, as well at the figure as at the words of Don Quixote, though they did not understand one half of what he meant by them. They finished their dinner, took their images on their backs, and bidding farewell to Don Quixote resumed their journey.\\n\\n Sancho was amazed afresh at the extent of his master’s knowledge, as much as if he had never known him, for it seemed to him that there was no story or event in the world that he had not at his fingers’ ends and fixed in his memory, and he said to him, “In truth, master mine, if this that has happened to us to-day is to be called an adventure, it has been one of the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us in the whole course of our travels; we have come out of it unbelaboured and undismayed, neither have we drawn sword nor have we smitten the earth with our bodies, nor have we been left famishing; blessed be God that he has let me see such a thing with my own eyes!”\\n\\n “Thou sayest well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “but remember all times are not alike nor do they always run the same way; and these things the vulgar commonly call omens, which are not based upon any natural reason, will by him who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happy accidents merely. One of these believers in omens will get up of a morning, leave his house, and meet a friar of the order of the blessed Saint Francis, and, as if he had met a griffin, he will turn about and go home. With another Mendoza the salt is spilt on his table, and gloom is spilt over his heart, as if nature was obliged to give warning of coming misfortunes by means of such trivial things as these. The wise man and the Christian should not trifle with what it may please heaven to do. Scipio on coming to Africa stumbled as he leaped on shore; his soldiers took it as a bad omen; but he, clasping the soil with his arms, exclaimed, ‘Thou canst not escape me, Africa, for I hold thee tight between my arms.’ Thus, Sancho, meeting those images has been to me a most happy occurrence.”\\n\\n “I can well believe it,” said Sancho; “but I wish your worship would tell me what is the reason that the Spaniards, when they are about to give battle, in calling on that Saint James the Moorslayer, say ‘Santiago and close Spain!’ Is Spain, then, open, so that it is needful to close it; or what is the meaning of this form?”\\n\\n “Thou art very simple, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “God, look you, gave that great knight of the Red Cross to Spain as her patron saint and protector, especially in those hard struggles the Spaniards had with the Moors; and therefore they invoke and call upon him as their defender in all their battles; and in these he has been many a time seen beating down, trampling under foot, destroying and slaughtering the Hagarene squadrons in the sight of all; of which fact I could give thee many examples recorded in truthful Spanish histories.”\\n\\n Sancho changed the subject, and said to his master, “I marvel, senor, at the boldness of Altisidora, the duchess’s handmaid; he whom they call Love must have cruelly pierced and wounded her; they say he is a little blind urchin who, though blear-eyed, or more properly speaking sightless, if he aims at a heart, be it ever so small, hits it and pierces it through and through with his arrows. I have heard it said too that the arrows of Love are blunted and robbed of their points by maidenly modesty and reserve; but with this Altisidora it seems they are sharpened rather than blunted.”\\n\\n “Bear in mind, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that love is influenced by no consideration, recognises no restraints of reason, and is of the same nature as death, that assails alike the lofty palaces of kings and the humble cabins of shepherds; and when it takes entire possession of a heart, the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it; and so without shame Altisidora declared her passion, which excited in my mind embarrassment rather than commiseration.”\\n\\n “Notable cruelty!” exclaimed Sancho; “unheard-of ingratitude! I can only say for myself that the very smallest loving word of hers would have subdued me and made a slave of me. The devil! What a heart of marble, what bowels of brass, what a soul of mortar! But I can’t imagine what it is that this damsel saw in your worship that could have conquered and captivated her so. What gallant figure was it, what bold bearing, what sprightly grace, what comeliness of feature, which of these things by itself, or what all together, could have made her fall in love with you? For indeed and in truth many a time I stop to look at your worship from the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your head, and I see more to frighten one than to make one fall in love; moreover I have heard say that beauty is the first and main thing that excites love, and as your worship has none at all, I don’t know what the poor creature fell in love with.”\\n\\n “Recollect, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “there are two sorts of beauty, one of the mind, the other of the body; that of the mind displays and exhibits itself in intelligence, in modesty, in honourable conduct, in generosity, in good breeding; and all these qualities are possible and may exist in an ugly man; and when it is this sort of beauty and not that of the body that is the attraction, love is apt to spring up suddenly and violently. I, Sancho, perceive clearly enough that I am not beautiful, but at the same time I know I am not hideous; and it is enough for an honest man not to be a monster to he an object of love, if only he possesses the endowments of mind I have mentioned.”\\n\\n While engaged in this discourse they were making their way through a wood that lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expecting anything of the kind, Don Quixote found himself caught in some nets of green cord stretched from one tree to another; and unable to conceive what it could be, he said to Sancho, “Sancho, it strikes me this affair of these nets will prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable. May I die if the enchanters that persecute me are not trying to entangle me in them and delay my journey, by way of revenge for my obduracy towards Altisidora. Well then let me tell them that if these nets, instead of being green cord, were made of the hardest diamonds, or stronger than that wherewith the jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshed Venus and Mars, I would break them as easily as if they were made of rushes or cotton threads.” But just as he was about to press forward and break through all, suddenly from among some trees two shepherdesses of surpassing beauty presented themselves to his sight — or at least damsels dressed like shepherdesses, save that their jerkins and sayas were of fine brocade; that is to say, the sayas were rich farthingales of gold embroidered tabby. Their hair, that in its golden brightness vied with the beams of the sun itself, fell loose upon their shoulders and was crowned with garlands twined with green laurel and red everlasting; and their years to all appearance were not under fifteen nor above eighteen.\\n\\n \\n\\n Such was the spectacle that filled Sancho with amazement, fascinated Don Quixote, made the sun halt in his course to behold them, and held all four in a strange silence. One of the shepherdesses, at length, was the first to speak and said to Don Quixote, “Hold, sir knight, and do not break these nets; for they are not spread here to do you any harm, but only for our amusement; and as I know you will ask why they have been put up, and who we are, I will tell you in a few words. In a village some two leagues from this, where there are many people of quality and rich gentlefolk, it was agreed upon by a number of friends and relations to come with their wives, sons and daughters, neighbours, friends and kinsmen, and make holiday in this spot, which is one of the pleasantest in the whole neighbourhood, setting up a new pastoral Arcadia among ourselves, we maidens dressing ourselves as shepherdesses and the youths as shepherds. We have prepared two eclogues, one by the famous poet Garcilasso, the other by the most excellent Camoens, in its own Portuguese tongue, but we have not as yet acted them. Yesterday was the first day of our coming here; we have a few of what they say are called field-tents pitched among the trees on the bank of an ample brook that fertilises all these meadows; last night we spread these nets in the trees here to snare the silly little birds that startled by the noise we make may fly into them. If you please to he our guest, senor, you will be welcomed heartily and courteously, for here just now neither care nor sorrow shall enter.”\\n\\n She held her peace and said no more, and Don Quixote made answer, “Of a truth, fairest lady, Actaeon when he unexpectedly beheld Diana bathing in the stream could not have been more fascinated and wonderstruck than I at the sight of your beauty. I commend your mode of entertainment, and thank you for the kindness of your invitation; and if I can serve you, you may command me with full confidence of being obeyed, for my profession is none other than to show myself grateful, and ready to serve persons of all conditions, but especially persons of quality such as your appearance indicates; and if, instead of taking up, as they probably do, but a small space, these nets took up the whole surface of the globe, I would seek out new worlds through which to pass, so as not to break them; and that ye may give some degree of credence to this exaggerated language of mine, know that it is no less than Don Quixote of La Mancha that makes this declaration to you, if indeed it be that such a name has reached your ears.”\\n\\n “Ah! friend of my soul,” instantly exclaimed the other shepherdess, “what great good fortune has befallen us! Seest thou this gentleman we have before us? Well then let me tell thee he is the most valiant and the most devoted and the most courteous gentleman in all the world, unless a history of his achievements that has been printed and I have read is telling lies and deceiving us. I will lay a wager that this good fellow who is with him is one Sancho Panza his squire, whose drolleries none can equal.”\\n\\n “That’s true,” said Sancho; “I am that same droll and squire you speak of, and this gentleman is my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, the same that’s in the history and that they talk about.”\\n\\n “Oh, my friend,” said the other, “let us entreat him to stay; for it will give our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure; I too have heard just what thou hast told me of the valour of the one and the drolleries of the other; and what is more, of him they say that he is the most constant and loyal lover that was ever heard of, and that his lady is one Dulcinea del Toboso, to whom all over Spain the palm of beauty is awarded.”\\n\\n “And justly awarded,” said Don Quixote, “unless, indeed, your unequalled beauty makes it a matter of doubt. But spare yourselves the trouble, ladies, of pressing me to stay, for the urgent calls of my profession do not allow me to take rest under any circumstances.”\\n\\n At this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood a brother of one of the two shepherdesses, like them in shepherd costume, and as richly and gaily dressed as they were. They told him that their companion was the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, and the other Sancho his squire, of whom he knew already from having read their history. The gay shepherd offered him his services and begged that he would accompany him to their tents, and Don Quixote had to give way and comply. And now the gave was started, and the nets were filled with a variety of birds that deceived by the colour fell into the danger they were flying from. Upwards of thirty persons, all gaily attired as shepherds and shepherdesses, assembled on the spot, and were at once informed who Don Quixote and his squire were, whereat they were not a little delighted, as they knew of him already through his history. They repaired to the tents, where they found tables laid out, and choicely, plentifully, and neatly furnished. They treated Don Quixote as a person of distinction, giving him the place of honour, and all observed him, and were full of astonishment at the spectacle. At last the cloth being removed, Don Quixote with great composure lifted up his voice and said:\\n\\n “One of the greatest sins that men are guilty of is — some will say pride — but I say ingratitude, going by the common saying that hell is full of ingrates. This sin, so far as it has lain in my power, I have endeavoured to avoid ever since I have enjoyed the faculty of reason; and if I am unable to requite good deeds that have been done me by other deeds, I substitute the desire to do so; and if that be not enough I make them known publicly; for he who declares and makes known the good deeds done to him would repay them by others if it were in his power, and for the most part those who receive are the inferiors of those who give. Thus, God is superior to all because he is the supreme giver, and the offerings of man fall short by an infinite distance of being a full return for the gifts of God; but gratitude in some degree makes up for this deficiency and shortcoming. I therefore, grateful for the favour that has been extended to me here, and unable to make a return in the same measure, restricted as I am by the narrow limits of my power, offer what I can and what I have to offer in my own way; and so I declare that for two full days I will maintain in the middle of this highway leading to Saragossa, that these ladies disguised as shepherdesses, who are here present, are the fairest and most courteous maidens in the world, excepting only the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole mistress of my thoughts, be it said without offence to those who hear me, ladies and gentlemen.”\\n\\n On hearing this Sancho, who had been listening with great attention, cried out in a loud voice, “Is it possible there is anyone in the world who will dare to say and swear that this master of mine is a madman? Say, gentlemen shepherds, is there a village priest, be he ever so wise or learned, who could say what my master has said; or is there knight-errant, whatever renown he may have as a man of valour, that could offer what my master has offered now?”\\n\\n Don Quixote turned upon Sancho, and with a countenance glowing with anger said to him, “Is it possible, Sancho, there is anyone in the whole world who will say thou art not a fool, with a lining to match, and I know not what trimmings of impertinence and roguery? Who asked thee to meddle in my affairs, or to inquire whether I am a wise man or a blockhead? Hold thy peace; answer me not a word; saddle Rocinante if he be unsaddled; and let us go to put my offer into execution; for with the right that I have on my side thou mayest reckon as vanquished all who shall venture to question it;” and in a great rage, and showing his anger plainly, he rose from his seat, leaving the company lost in wonder, and making them feel doubtful whether they ought to regard him as a madman or a rational being. In the end, though they sought to dissuade him from involving himself in such a challenge, assuring him they admitted his gratitude as fully established, and needed no fresh proofs to be convinced of his valiant spirit, as those related in the history of his exploits were sufficient, still Don Quixote persisted in his resolve; and mounted on Rocinante, bracing his buckler on his arm and grasping his lance, he posted himself in the middle of a high road that was not far from the green meadow. Sancho followed on Dapple, together with all the members of the pastoral gathering, eager to see what would be the upshot of his vainglorious and extraordinary proposal.\\n\\n Don Quixote, then, having, as has been said, planted himself in the middle of the road, made the welkin ring with words to this effect: “Ho ye travellers and wayfarers, knights, squires, folk on foot or on horseback, who pass this way or shall pass in the course of the next two days! Know that Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant, is posted here to maintain by arms that the beauty and courtesy enshrined in the nymphs that dwell in these meadows and groves surpass all upon earth, putting aside the lady of my heart, Dulcinea del Toboso. Wherefore, let him who is of the opposite opinion come on, for here I await him.”\\n\\n Twice he repeated the same words, and twice they fell unheard by any adventurer; but fate, that was guiding affairs for him from better to better, so ordered it that shortly afterwards there appeared on the road a crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their hands, all riding in a compact body and in great haste. No sooner had those who were with Don Quixote seen them than they turned about and withdrew to some distance from the road, for they knew that if they stayed some harm might come to them; but Don Quixote with intrepid heart stood his ground, and Sancho Panza shielded himself with Rocinante’s hind-quarters. The troop of lancers came up, and one of them who was in advance began shouting to Don Quixote, “Get out of the way, you son of the devil, or these bulls will knock you to pieces!”\\n\\n “Rabble!” returned Don Quixote, “I care nothing for bulls, be they the fiercest Jarama breeds on its banks. Confess at once, scoundrels, that what I have declared is true; else ye have to deal with me in combat.”\\n\\n The herdsman had no time to reply, nor Don Quixote to get out of the way even if he wished; and so the drove of fierce bulls and tame bullocks, together with the crowd of herdsmen and others who were taking them to be penned up in a village where they were to be run the next day, passed over Don Quixote and over Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple, hurling them all to the earth and rolling them over on the ground. Sancho was left crushed, Don Quixote scared, Dapple belaboured and Rocinante in no very sound condition.\\n\\n \\n\\n They all got up, however, at length, and Don Quixote in great haste, stumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove, shouting out, “Hold! stay! ye rascally rabble, a single knight awaits you, and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say, ‘For a flying enemy make a bridge of silver.’” The retreating party in their haste, however, did not stop for that, or heed his menaces any more than last year’s clouds. Weariness brought Don Quixote to a halt, and more enraged than avenged he sat down on the road to wait until Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple came up. When they reached him master and man mounted once more, and without going back to bid farewell to the mock or imitation Arcadia, and more in humiliation than contentment, they continued their journey.\\n\\n \\n\\n 唐吉诃德和桑乔遭受了公牛的非礼之后，一路风尘，来到了树林间的一泓清泉边。他们为驴和马摘掉了笼头，任其游荡。主仆二人坐下来，桑乔从他藏食品的褡裢里拿出了一些他称为熟肉的食物。唐吉诃德漱了口，洗了脸，清凉了一下，觉得精神爽快些了。他心中烦闷，没有吃东西；桑乔仅仅是出于礼貌才没动摆在自己面前的东西，主人没吃，他也不敢先尝。可是，他见主人只管自己想心事，根本就没想去拿面包，也就不顾什么规矩了，一声不吭地拿起面包和奶酪往肚子里填。\\n\\n “吃吧，桑乔朋友，”唐吉诃德说，“你得维持生命，这比我维持自己的生命更重要。我忧心忡忡，厄运不断，干脆让我死掉算了。桑乔，我生来就是虽生犹死，而你呢，是为死而吃。为了让你知道我说的是实话，你不妨想想，我这个人史书有载，武艺有名，行为有礼，王宫有请，姑娘有求，总之，我本来应该由于我的英勇业绩而得到桂冠，取得英名，可是今天上午我却被那些粗野无礼的牲畜踩得浑身疼痛。现在，我的牙崩了，手也麻了，完全没有胃口了。所以，我想还是让自己饿死算了，这是一种最残酷的死亡方式。”\\n\\n “可我觉得，”桑乔说，“有句俗语，您大概不会赞成，就是说‘死也要当饱死鬼’。至少我不想把自己饿死，相反，我倒想像皮匠那样。皮匠用牙齿把皮子咬住，尽可能地拉长。我也会拼命吃，尽力延长我的生命，一直到气数已尽。您应该知道，大人，世界上再没有比像您这样绝望更傻的事了。还是听我的吧，吃完东西以后在这片绿草垫子上睡一会儿，醒来后您就会觉得好一些。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德觉得桑乔这几句话不仅不傻，倒有点哲学家的味道，便同意了。不过，他对桑乔说道：\\n\\n “喂，桑乔，如果你能按照我现在说的去做，我的心情就会轻松一些，不那么难受。那就是当我按照你说的去睡觉的时候，你往远处走一点儿，解开衣服，用罗西南多的缰绳抽打自己三四百下。要想让杜尔西内亚摆脱魔法，你还差三千多下呢。由于你的疏忽，她现在仍然受着魔法的折磨，这是多大的憾事呀。”\\n\\n “这事可得从长计议，”桑乔说，“咱们俩现在还是先睡觉，然后再说吧。您该知道，让一个人狠狠抽打自己，这可不是简单的事情，更何况是个腹中空空的人呢。我的女主人杜尔西内亚夫人还是耐心点儿吧，也许她在某个意想不到的时候发现我已经被打得百孔千疮了。‘不死就有日子’，我是说，只要我还活着，我就愿意实现我的诺言。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德对此表示感谢，然后吃了点儿东西。桑乔吃得可不少。吃完后，两人倒地睡觉，任凭那两头牲口在肥沃的草地上随意啃青。他们醒来时天色已渐晚，两人便赶紧骑上牲口继续赶路，想尽快赶到一西里外的一个客店去。我这里说客店是因为唐吉诃德称它为客店，而没有像以往那样把所有的客店都称为城堡。\\n\\n 他们来到客店，问店主是否还有房间。店主说不仅有，而且条件很好，在萨拉戈萨可称是独占鳌头。两人从马背和驴背上翻身跃下。店主给了桑乔一把钥匙，桑乔把他们带的食物放到一个房间里，又把两匹牲口牵到马厩里，喂了些草料，然后出来看唐吉诃德还有什么吩咐。唐吉诃德正坐在一个石凳上。桑乔特别感谢老天，他的主人这次没把客店当成城堡。到了吃晚饭的时间，两人回到他们的房间。桑乔问店主，晚饭有什么可吃的，店主回答说，那要看客人的口味了，可以说想吃什么有什么，从天上的飞鸟到地上的家禽，还有海里的鱼，应有尽有。\\n\\n “用不了那么多，”桑乔说，“我们俩只要有两只烤鸡就够了。我的主人身体不舒服，吃不多，我吃得也不是特别多。”\\n\\n 店主说没有鸡，鸡都被老鹰叼走了。\\n\\n “那么，您就去让他们烤一只嫩母鸡吧。”桑乔说。\\n\\n “母鸡？我的妈呀！”店主说，“实话告诉你，我昨天把五十多只母鸡都拿到城里卖掉了。除了母鸡，你随便要什么都可以。”\\n\\n “那么，”桑乔说，“牛犊肉或羊羔肉总该有吧。”\\n\\n “现在客店里没有，”店主说，“没有是因为用完了。不过，下星期有的是。”\\n\\n “这下可好了，”桑乔说，“这也没有，那也没有，咸肉和鸡蛋总该有吧？”\\n\\n “我的天哪，”店主说，“这位客人可真够笨的。我刚才说过这儿没有母鸡，你怎么还想要鸡蛋呢？你再想想，还有什么好吃的，可以要点儿美味的东西。”\\n\\n “我的天哪，这么办吧，”桑乔说，“店主大人，你说说你这儿有什么吧，我们也不用再考虑了。”\\n\\n “我有两只牛犊蹄一般大小的老牛蹄，或者说两只像老牛蹄一般大小的牛犊蹄，现在正煮着呢。我已经加了豆子、葱头和咸肉。这会儿它们正叫着：快来吃我吧，快来吃我吧。”\\n\\n “那么现在我们就要它，谁也不许再要了。”桑乔说，“我一定出比别人多的价钱。我最喜欢吃这种东西了。无论什么蹄子我都爱吃。”\\n\\n “没有人会再要的，”店主说，“因为我这里的其他客人都很有身份，他们都自己带着厨师、管理员和原料。”\\n\\n “若论有身份，”桑乔说，“谁也不如我的主人有身份。不过，他所从事的职业不允许他带着食物和饮料。我们躺在草地上吃橡子或野果就饱了。”\\n\\n 桑乔同店主的谈话到此为止，因为店主问桑乔他的主人是干什么的，桑乔就不愿意再往下说了。到了吃晚饭的时候，唐吉诃德仍留在房间里。店主把那锅牛蹄端来，自己也坐下来大大方方地一起吃。这个房间同隔壁那个房间似乎只隔着一堵薄墙。唐吉诃德听到那个房间里有人在说话：\\n\\n “亲爱的唐赫罗尼莫大人，趁现在还没有送晚饭来，咱们还是看看《唐吉诃德》的下卷吧。”\\n\\n 一听到提起自己的名字，唐吉诃德立刻站起来，仔细倾听他们的谈话。只听得那个唐赫罗尼莫大人说道：\\n\\n “唐胡安大人，您为什么要看那些胡言乱语呢？凡是读过《唐吉诃德》上卷的人都知道，这部小说索然无味，那么下卷还会有什么意思呢？”\\n\\n “尽管如此，”唐胡安说，“还是看看为好。无论哪本书，都是开卷有益。不过，我最不满意的就是书上说，唐吉诃德已经不再忠于托博索的杜尔西内亚了。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德闻言勃然大怒，说道：\\n\\n “无论是谁，只要他说曼查的唐吉诃德抛弃了托博索的杜尔西内亚，我就要同他拼命，让他知道这纯粹是一派胡言！唐吉诃德根本不可能抛弃杜尔西内亚。杜尔西内亚也不可能被唐吉诃德抛弃，她不会被任何人抛弃。唐吉诃德并不是那种见异思迁的人，而且他的职业也不允许他移情别处。”\\n\\n “谁在听我们说话？”隔壁有人说道。\\n\\n “还能有谁呢，”桑乔说，“只能是曼查的唐吉诃德本人。他说到就能做到，更何况他‘既然能还帐，就不怕抵押’呢。”\\n\\n 桑乔刚说完，就看见两个骑士装束的人进了房门。其中一人搂住唐吉诃德的脖子说道：\\n\\n “见了您，果然名不虚传。而您的盛名又使您不虚此行。确切无疑，您就是真正的唐吉诃德，是游侠骑士的北斗星和指路明灯。有的人竟想顶替您的英名，诋毁您的功绩，就像这本书的作者那样，只能是徒劳一场。”\\n\\n 那人说着把同伴手里的一本书交给唐吉诃德。唐吉诃德接过来，一言不发，翻了翻书，过了一会儿才说道：\\n\\n “我只随便翻了一下，便发现作者有三点不堪一击。首先是序言上的几句话；其次是作者的阿拉贡语风，他写东西时有些地方没用冠词；第三点就是主要情节不符合事实。例如，这儿说我的侍从桑乔·潘萨的妻子叫玛丽·古铁雷斯，其实她叫特雷莎·潘萨。既然在这么重要的地方都有误，其他地方的谬误就可想而知了。”\\n\\n 桑乔说道：\\n\\n “这种人算什么呀！居然把我老婆特雷莎·潘萨说成是玛丽·古铁雷斯！大人，您再翻翻书，看看书里是不是有我的名字，是不是把我的名字也改了？”\\n\\n “朋友，听你说话这口气，”唐赫罗尼莫说，“你肯定就是唐吉诃德大人的侍从桑乔·潘萨了？”\\n\\n “正是我，”桑乔说，“我为此感到骄傲。”\\n\\n “实话对你讲，”那人说道，“这位作者并没有把你如实写出来。他把你描述成一个贪吃的笨蛋，一点儿也不滑稽，与写你主人那本书上卷里的桑乔完全不同。”\\n\\n “愿上帝饶恕他吧，”桑乔说，“他完全可以不写我嘛。不知道就别乱说，事情该怎么样就是怎么样。”\\n\\n 那两个人请唐吉诃德到他们房间去与他们共进晚餐。他们很清楚，那个客店里没有什么适合唐吉诃德吃的东西。唐吉诃德不便推辞，就很有礼貌地过去同他们一起吃晚饭，于是这锅牛蹄就成桑乔的了。桑乔坐到了上首位置，店主也挨着他坐下来。他同桑乔一样对蹄类食品很感兴趣。\\n\\n 吃晚饭时，唐胡安向唐吉诃德打听有关杜尔西内亚的情况，问他们是否已经结婚，杜尔西内亚是否怀孕了，或者仍是个处女。如果她仍守身如玉，那么，她对唐吉诃德也肯定一往情深。唐吉诃德答道：\\n\\n “杜尔西内亚仍然完好如初，我对她也比以往任何时候都忠贞。我们之间的联系同以前一样，并不频繁，不过，她的花容月貌现在已变成一个丑陋的农妇模样了。”\\n\\n 接着，唐吉诃德讲述了杜尔西内亚中魔法以及他在蒙特西诺斯洞窟内看到的情况，还提到了贤人梅尔林曾吩咐过，若想让杜尔西内亚摆脱魔法，就得让桑乔自己鞭笞自己。那两个人听唐吉诃德讲述他的这些奇遇觉得非常有意思，同时又对他能把这些乱七八糟的东西讲得有声有色感到惊奇。他一会儿讲得有条有理，一会儿又讲得糊里糊涂，让人搞不清他到底是明白人还是疯子。\\n\\n 桑乔吃完晚饭，撇下那个已经醉倒的店主，来到唐吉诃德所在的房间，进门便说道：\\n\\n “我敢拿生命打赌，诸位大人，你们看的那本书的作者肯定是跟我过不去。他把我说成了馋鬼，但愿他别再把我称为醉鬼。”\\n\\n “他的确把你说成醉鬼，”唐赫罗尼莫说，“但我忘记是怎么说的了，我只知道说得挺不好的。不过，我亲眼见到了眼前这位桑乔，就知道那全是胡说八道。”\\n\\n “请你们诸位相信，你们看的那本书里的桑乔和唐吉诃德大概是另外两个人，而不是锡德·哈迈德·贝嫩赫利写的书里的桑乔和唐吉诃德。我们是贝嫩赫利写的唐吉诃德和桑乔。我的主人勇敢、机智而又多情，我单纯、滑稽，既不贪吃也不贪杯。”“我也这样认为。”唐胡安说，“如果可能的话，应该下令除了原作者锡德·哈迈德之外，任何人都不许记述伟大的唐吉诃德的事情，就像亚历山大下令除了阿佩莱斯①之外，任何人都不许画他的像一样。”\\n\\n ①阿佩莱斯是古希腊时代早期的画家，曾为马其顿的腓力二世及其子亚历山大大帝充当宫廷画师。\\n\\n “谁愿意写我就写吧，”唐吉诃德说，“但是不要丑化我。\\n\\n 污蔑太多往往会导致让人失去耐心。”\\n\\n “若不是唐吉诃德大人这么有耐心，”唐胡安说，“我估计他这种耐心是相当大的，恐怕没有什么污蔑可以逃脱他的反击。”\\n\\n 大家说着话消磨了大半夜，虽然唐胡安想让唐吉诃德再翻翻那本书，看看还有什么可说的，最终却未能如愿。唐吉诃德说，就算他把全书都看了，也只能说是满篇荒谬，而且，万一传到那本书作者的耳朵里，说唐吉诃德见过那本书，他就该得意了，还以为唐吉诃德通读了那本书呢。人心里应该干净，眼睛里更应该干净。那两个人问唐吉诃德准备到哪儿去，唐吉诃德说要到萨拉戈萨去参加一年一度的盔甲擂台赛。唐胡安说，那本书里讲到唐吉诃德或其他什么人曾参加了一次穿环擂台赛，写得毫无新意，缺乏文采，没有特点，全是一派胡言。”\\n\\n “如果情况是这样，”唐吉诃德说，“我就不去萨拉戈萨了，这样就可以揭穿作者的谎言，让人们知道我并不是他说的那个唐吉诃德。”\\n\\n “您做得很对，”唐赫罗尼莫说，“在巴塞罗那另外还有其他一些比赛，您可以在那儿显示您的风采。”\\n\\n “我也想这样。”唐吉诃德说，“现在是睡觉的时候了，请原谅，我要上床休息了。请你们务必把我当成你们的一位老朋友和侍者。”\\n\\n “我也如此，”桑乔说，“也许什么时候我能为你们做点儿事情。”\\n\\n 他们互相道别，唐吉诃德和桑乔回到了自己的房间，剩下唐胡安和唐赫罗尼莫仍在那里为看到唐吉诃德既明智又疯癫而发呆。他们确信，这两个人就是真正的唐吉诃德和桑乔，而不是那位阿拉贡作者杜撰的那两个。\\n\\n 第二天早晨，唐吉诃德用手拍打着隔壁房间的薄墙，向那两个人告别。桑乔慷慨地向店主付了钱，让店主少吹牛，多置办些东西。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4679.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
