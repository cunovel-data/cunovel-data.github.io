{"id":42216,"no":76,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 22","content":"Many and great were the attentions shown to Don Quixote by the newly married couple, who felt themselves under an obligation to him for coming forward in defence of their cause; and they exalted his wisdom to the same level with his courage, rating him as a Cid in arms, and a Cicero in eloquence. Worthy Sancho enjoyed himself for three days at the expense of the pair, from whom they learned that the sham wound was not a scheme arranged with the fair Quiteria, but a device of Basilio’s , who counted on exactly the result they had seen; he confessed, it is true, that he had confided his idea to some of his friends, so that at the proper time they might aid him in his purpose and insure the success of the deception. “That,” said Don Quixote, “is not and ought not to be called deception which aims at virtuous ends;” and the marriage of lovers he maintained to be a most excellent end, reminding them, however, that love has no greater enemy than hunger and constant want; for love is all gaiety, enjoyment, and happiness, especially when the lover is in the possession of the object of his love, and poverty and want are the declared enemies of all these; which he said to urge Senor Basilio to abandon the practice of those accomplishments he was skilled in, for though they brought him fame, they brought him no money, and apply himself to the acquisition of wealth by legitimate industry, which will never fail those who are prudent and persevering. The poor man who is a man of honour (if indeed a poor man can be a man of honour) has a jewel when he has a fair wife, and if she is taken from him, his honour is taken from him and slain. The fair woman who is a woman of honour, and whose husband is poor, deserves to be crowned with the laurels and crowns of victory and triumph. Beauty by itself attracts the desires of all who behold it, and the royal eagles and birds of towering flight stoop on it as on a dainty lure; but if beauty be accompanied by want and penury, then the ravens and the kites and other birds of prey assail it, and she who stands firm against such attacks well deserves to be called the crown of her husband. “Remember, O prudent Basilio,” added Don Quixote, “it was the opinion of a certain sage, I know not whom, that there was not more than one good woman in the whole world; and his advice was that each one should think and believe that this one good woman was his own wife, and in this way he would live happy. I myself am not married, nor, so far, has it ever entered my thoughts to be so; nevertheless I would venture to give advice to anyone who might ask it, as to the mode in which he should seek a wife such as he would be content to marry. The first thing I would recommend him, would be to look to good name rather than to wealth, for a good woman does not win a good name merely by being good, but by letting it he seen that she is so, and open looseness and freedom do much more damage to a woman’s honour than secret depravity. If you take a good woman into your house it will he an easy matter to keep her good, and even to make her still better; but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to mend her, for it is no very easy matter to pass from one extreme to another. I do not say it is impossible, but I look upon it as difficult.” Sancho, listening to all this, said to himself, “This master of mine, when I say anything that has weight and substance, says I might take a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons; but I say of him that, when he begins stringing maxims together and giving advice not only might he take a pulpit in hand, but two on each finger, and go into the market-places to his heart’s content. Devil take you for a knight-errant, what a lot of things you know! I used to think in my heart that the only thing he knew was what belonged to his chivalry; but there is nothing he won’t have a finger in.” Sancho muttered this somewhat aloud, and his master overheard him, and asked, “What art thou muttering there, Sancho?” “I’m not saying anything or muttering anything,” said Sancho; “I was only saying to myself that I wish I had heard what your worship has said just now before I married; perhaps I’d say now, ‘The ox that’s loose licks himself well.’” “Is thy Teresa so bad then, Sancho?” “She is not very bad,” replied Sancho; “but she is not very good; at least she is not as good as I could wish.” “Thou dost wrong, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “to speak ill of thy wife; for after all she is the mother of thy children.” “We are quits,” returned Sancho; “for she speaks ill of me whenever she takes it into her head, especially when she is jealous; and Satan himself could not put up with her then.” In fine, they remained three days with the newly married couple, by whom they were entertained and treated like kings. Don Quixote begged the fencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to the cave of Montesinos, as he had a great desire to enter it and see with his own eyes if the wonderful tales that were told of it all over the country were true. The licentiate said he would get him a cousin of his own, a famous scholar, and one very much given to reading books of chivalry, who would have great pleasure in conducting him to the mouth of the very cave, and would show him the lakes of Ruidera, which were likewise famous all over La Mancha, and even all over Spain; and he assured him he would find him entertaining, for he was a youth who could write books good enough to be printed and dedicated to princes. The cousin arrived at last, leading an ass in foal, with a pack-saddle covered with a parti-coloured carpet or sackcloth; Sancho saddled Rocinante, got Dapple ready, and stocked his alforjas, along with which went those of the cousin, likewise well filled; and so, commending themselves to God and bidding farewell to all, they set out, taking the road for the famous cave of Montesinos. On the way Don Quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character his pursuits, avocations, and studies were, to which he replied that he was by profession a humanist, and that his pursuits and studies were making books for the press, all of great utility and no less entertainment to the nation. One was called “The Book of Liveries,” in which he described seven hundred and three liveries, with their colours, mottoes, and ciphers, from which gentlemen of the court might pick and choose any they fancied for festivals and revels, without having to go a-begging for them from anyone, or puzzling their brains, as the saying is, to have them appropriate to their objects and purposes; “for,” said he, “I give the jealous, the rejected, the forgotten, the absent, what will suit them, and fit them without fail. I have another book, too, which I shall call ‘Metamorphoses, or the Spanish Ovid,’ one of rare and original invention, for imitating Ovid in burlesque style, I show in it who the Giralda of Seville and the Angel of the Magdalena were, what the sewer of Vecinguerra at Cordova was, what the bulls of Guisando, the Sierra Morena, the Leganitos and Lavapies fountains at Madrid, not forgetting those of the Piojo, of the Cano Dorado, and of the Priora; and all with their allegories, metaphors, and changes, so that they are amusing, interesting, and instructive, all at once. Another book I have which I call ‘The Supplement to Polydore Vergil,’ which treats of the invention of things, and is a work of great erudition and research, for I establish and elucidate elegantly some things of great importance which Polydore omitted to mention. He forgot to tell us who was the first man in the world that had a cold in his head, and who was the first to try salivation for the French disease, but I give it accurately set forth, and quote more than five-and-twenty authors in proof of it, so you may perceive I have laboured to good purpose and that the book will be of service to the whole world.” Sancho, who had been very attentive to the cousin’s words, said to him, “Tell me, senor — and God give you luck in printing your books — can you tell me (for of course you know, as you know everything) who was the first man that scratched his head? For to my thinking it must have been our father Adam.” “So it must,” replied the cousin; “for there is no doubt but Adam had a head and hair; and being the first man in the world he would have scratched himself sometimes.” “So I think,” said Sancho; “but now tell me, who was the first tumbler in the world?” “Really, brother,” answered the cousin, “I could not at this moment say positively without having investigated it; I will look it up when I go back to where I have my books, and will satisfy you the next time we meet, for this will not be the last time.” “Look here, senor,” said Sancho, “don’t give yourself any trouble about it, for I have just this minute hit upon what I asked you. The first tumbler in the world, you must know, was Lucifer, when they cast or pitched him out of heaven; for he came tumbling into the bottomless pit.” “You are right, friend,” said the cousin; and said Don Quixote, “Sancho, that question and answer are not thine own; thou hast heard them from some one else.” “Hold your peace, senor,” said Sancho; “faith, if I take to asking questions and answering, I’ll go on from this till to-morrow morning. Nay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn’t go looking for help from my neighbours.” “Thou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “for there are some who weary themselves out in learning and proving things that, after they are known and proved, are not worth a farthing to the understanding or memory.” In this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that night they put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues to the cave of Montesinos, so the cousin told Don Quixote, adding, that if he was bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him to provide himself with ropes, so that he might be tied and lowered into its depths. Don Quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomless pit he meant to see where it went to; so they bought about a hundred fathoms of rope, and next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at the cave, the mouth of which is spacious and wide, but full of thorn and wild-fig bushes and brambles and briars, so thick and matted that they completely close it up and cover it over. On coming within sight of it the cousin, Sancho, and Don Quixote dismounted, and the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly with the ropes, and as they were girding and swathing him Sancho said to him, “Mind what you are about, master mine; don’t go burying yourself alive, or putting yourself where you’ll be like a bottle put to cool in a well; it’s no affair or business of your worship’s to become the explorer of this, which must be worse than a Moorish dungeon.” “Tie me and hold thy peace,” said Don Quixote, “for an emprise like this, friend Sancho, was reserved for me;” and said the guide, “I beg of you, Senor Don Quixote, to observe carefully and examine with a hundred eyes everything that is within there; perhaps there may be some things for me to put into my book of ‘Transformations.’” “The drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough,” said Sancho Panza. When he had said this and finished the tying (which was not over the armour but only over the doublet) Don Quixote observed, “It was careless of us not to have provided ourselves with a small cattle-bell to be tied on the rope close to me, the sound of which would show that I was still descending and alive; but as that is out of the question now, in God’s hand be it to guide me;” and forthwith he fell on his knees and in a low voice offered up a prayer to heaven, imploring God to aid him and grant him success in this to all appearance perilous and untried adventure, and then exclaimed aloud, “O mistress of my actions and movements, illustrious and peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, if so be the prayers and supplications of this fortunate lover can reach thy ears, by thy incomparable beauty I entreat thee to listen to them, for they but ask thee not to refuse me thy favour and protection now that I stand in such need of them. I am about to precipitate, to sink, to plunge myself into the abyss that is here before me, only to let the world know that while thou dost favour me there is no impossibility I will not attempt and accomplish.” With these words he approached the cavern, and perceived that it was impossible to let himself down or effect an entrance except by sheer force or cleaving a passage; so drawing his sword he began to demolish and cut away the brambles at the mouth of the cave, at the noise of which a vast multitude of crows and choughs flew out of it so thick and so fast that they knocked Don Quixote down; and if he had been as much of a believer in augury as he was a Catholic Christian he would have taken it as a bad omen and declined to bury himself in such a place. He got up, however, and as there came no more crows, or night-birds like the bats that flew out at the same time with the crows, the cousin and Sancho giving him rope, he lowered himself into the depths of the dread cavern; and as he entered it Sancho sent his blessing after him, making a thousand crosses over him and saying, “God, and the Pena de Francia, and the Trinity of Gaeta guide thee, flower and cream of knights-errant. There thou goest, thou dare-devil of the earth, heart of steel, arm of brass; once more, God guide thee and send thee back safe, sound, and unhurt to the light of this world thou art leaving to bury thyself in the darkness thou art seeking there;” and the cousin offered up almost the same prayers and supplications. Don Quixote kept calling to them to give him rope and more rope, and they gave it out little by little, and by the time the calls, which came out of the cave as out of a pipe, ceased to be heard they had let down the hundred fathoms of rope. They were inclined to pull Don Quixote up again, as they could give him no more rope; however, they waited about half an hour, at the end of which time they began to gather in the rope again with great ease and without feeling any weight, which made them fancy Don Quixote was remaining below; and persuaded that it was so, Sancho wept bitterly, and hauled away in great haste in order to settle the question. When, however, they had come to, as it seemed, rather more than eighty fathoms they felt a weight, at which they were greatly delighted; and at last, at ten fathoms more, they saw Don Quixote distinctly, and Sancho called out to him, saying, “Welcome back, senor, for we had begun to think you were going to stop there to found a family.” But Don Quixote answered not a word, and drawing him out entirely they perceived he had his eyes shut and every appearance of being fast asleep. They stretched him on the ground and untied him, but still he did not awake; however, they rolled him back and forwards and shook and pulled him about, so that after some time he came to himself, stretching himself just as if he were waking up from a deep and sound sleep, and looking about him he said, “God forgive you, friends; ye have taken me away from the sweetest and most delightful existence and spectacle that ever human being enjoyed or beheld. Now indeed do I know that all the pleasures of this life pass away like a shadow and a dream, or fade like the flower of the field. O ill-fated Montesinos! O sore-wounded Durandarte! O unhappy Belerma! O tearful Guadiana, and ye O hapless daughters of Ruidera who show in your waves the tears that flowed from your beauteous eyes!” The cousin and Sancho Panza listened with deep attention to the words of Don Quixote, who uttered them as though with immense pain he drew them up from his very bowels. They begged of him to explain himself, and tell them what he had seen in that hell down there. “Hell do you call it?” said Don Quixote; “call it by no such name, for it does not deserve it, as ye shall soon see.” He then begged them to give him something to eat, as he was very hungry. They spread the cousin’s sackcloth on the grass, and put the stores of the alforjas into requisition, and all three sitting down lovingly and sociably, they made a luncheon and a supper of it all in one; and when the sackcloth was removed, Don Quixote of La Mancha said, “Let no one rise, and attend to me, my sons, both of you.” 下午四点钟，太阳躲进了云层，只露出一点儿微弱的光线。唐吉诃德从容不迫地向他那两位忠实的听众介绍，自己在蒙特西诺斯洞窟里见到的情况。他开始说起来： “从这儿下到十二人或十四人深的地方，右侧有个凹面，里面宽敞得能够容得下几头骡子和一架大骡车。透过地面上的几个缝隙或窟窿，只能射进几束微弱的光线，远远不够照明用的。我又累又烦，正当我吊在绳子上又急又恼，不知该如何向下走时，我发现了那块凹面，便决定进去休息一下。我大声喊你们，让你们等我叫你们时再放绳子，可你们大概没听见我的叫声。于是，我就把你们徐徐放下的绳子收起，盘成一团，坐在上面考虑待一会儿没人给我放绳子了，我怎么才能下到洞底。我正在胡思乱想，忽然一股极度的困意袭来，我竟不知怎么回事就睡着了。待我醒来时，发现自己竟来到了一片美妙秀丽、人类思维难以想象的风景如画的草地上。 “我睁大了眼睛，又揉了揉眼皮，发现自己并没有睡着，确实醒着。尽管这样，我还是拍了拍自己的脑袋和胸脯，证明那确实是我自己，而不是什么虚无的幻觉，而且我的触觉、感觉和思维能力就和我现在的情况一样。接着，我的眼前出现了一座富丽堂皇的皇宫或王宫，它的墙壁似乎都是水晶的。宫殿的两扇大门打开了，我看见一位令人肃然起敬的长者向我走来。他身穿一件深紫色长袍，袍子长得拖到地上，胸前和肩膀上披着一条青缎披巾，头上戴着黑色米兰帽，长长的白胡须垂过腰间。他的手里除了一串念珠外没有任何东西。念珠的珠子比普通的胡桃还大，大珠①比鸵鸟蛋还大。那长者的气质、步伐以及庄重而又悠然自得的神态，无论是分别讲还是总体说，都使我感到惊奇。他来到我面前做的第一件事就是紧紧地拥抱我，然后对我说：‘曼查的英勇骑士唐吉诃德，我们被魔法困在这偏远的山洞里，已经恭候你多年了，希望你能够把这个蒙特西诺斯洞窟里的情况公诸于世。这样伟大的业绩只有像你这样勇敢无畏、气概非凡的人才能胜任。跟我来，尊贵的大人，我想让你看看发生在这座水晶宫里的奇事。我就是这儿的总管，将在这里终身留守。我就叫蒙特西诺斯，这个洞窟就是以我的名字命名的。’他一说他是蒙特西诺斯，我就问他，洞外世界传说他按照老朋友杜兰达尔德的吩咐，在杜兰达尔德临死之前，用一把小匕首把老朋友的心脏掏了出来，献给贝莱尔玛夫人，这事是否是真的。他说是真的，不过不是匕首，更不是小匕首，而是一种比锥子还尖的锋利短刀。” ①念珠每十粒小珠间有一颗大珠。 “准是塞维利亚的拉蒙·德奥塞斯造的那种短刀。”桑乔这时候说。 “我也不清楚，”唐吉诃德说，“但决不会是那位短刀匠造的，因为拉蒙·德奥塞斯是不久前的人物，而发生这桩悲剧的龙塞斯巴列斯年代则是在很早以前。不过，这点情况并不重要，并不影响事情的真实性和历史的连贯性。” “是这样。”小伙子说，“请您继续讲下去，唐吉诃德大人，我听得简直如痴如醉。” “我也讲得津津有味，”唐吉诃德说，“令人尊敬的长者蒙特西诺斯领我走进水晶宫，宫殿里又有个雪白的地宫，里面凉快极了，还有一座做工极其精细的大理石陵墓。我看见陵墓里躺着骑士。那骑士不像其他陵墓里的骑士那样，是青铜的、大理石的或玉的，而是有血有肉的人。他的右手放在心脏一侧，我看见他的手毛茸茸的，而且青筋暴露，看样子这位骑士很有力气。蒙特西诺斯见我看着陵墓发怔，不等我发问就对我说：‘这就是我的朋友杜兰达尔德，那个时代多情勇敢的骑士精英。他和我以及其他许多在这里的男女一样，被那个法国魔法师梅兰制服在这里。据说梅兰是魔鬼的弟子，可我觉得他不像，因为人家说他比魔鬼还强点儿呢。至于我们是怎么样以及为什么被制服在这里的，无人知晓，不过，随着时间的推移，以后肯定会知道的，我想这个日子已经为期不远了。令我惊奇的是，杜兰达尔德的的确确死在我的怀抱里，他死后我亲手把他的心脏取了出来。他的心脏大概足有两磅重。据自然科学家讲，心脏大的人要比心脏小的人勇敢。既然这位骑士确实死了，他现在怎么还能不时地唉声叹气，好像他仍然活着似的？’正说到这儿，只听杜兰达尔德大叫一声，说道： 蒙特西诺斯呀，我的兄弟， 我还有最后一件事求你， 那就是等我死后， 我的灵魂已经脱离身体， 请你用短刀或者匕首， 把我的心脏 从胸膛取出， 送到贝莱尔玛那里去。 “令人尊敬的蒙特西诺斯听到声音，立刻跪倒在骑士面前，眼含热泪地说道：‘杜兰达尔德大人，我极其尊贵的兄弟，我已经在我们遭受重大损失的那一天按照你的吩咐做了。我尽可能小心地把你的心脏取了出来，没有在你的胸膛里留下一丝残余部分。我用花边手绢把你的心脏擦干净，带着它踏上了去法国的路程。启程之前，我挥泪如雨，掩埋了你的尸体。泪水冲洗了我的双手，冲洗了我的手在你的胸膛里沾染的鲜血。说得再具体些，我最亲爱的兄弟，在走出龙塞斯瓦列斯以后，我一到达某个有盐的地方，就往你的心脏上撒了点儿盐，以便它被送到贝莱尔玛夫人面前时，即使不是新鲜的，至少也没有变味。贝莱尔玛夫人，你，我，你的侍从瓜迪亚纳，女管家鲁伊德拉和她的七个女儿、两个外甥女，还有你的其他许多熟人和朋友，都被魔法师梅兰制服在这里已经多年了。五百年过去了，可是我们没有一个人死，只是少了鲁伊德拉以及她的女儿和外甥女们。大概是因为她们总哭哭啼啼，梅兰起了怜悯之心，就把她们变成了同样数量的小河，在人世间和曼查被称为鲁伊德拉小河。七条女儿河属于西班牙国王，两个外甥女小河则属于一个十分神圣的圣胡安骑士团。你的侍从瓜迪亚纳为你的不幸以泪洗面，最终变成了瓜迪亚纳河。这条河流到地面上，看到另一个世界的太阳，想到此时已经没有了你，心里非常难过，就又重新钻入地底。但是，它毕竟不能不顺流而走，所以又不时地露出地面，于是太阳和人们又能看到它了。贝莱尔玛的那些小河和其他许多小河都用自己的水补充它，最后浩浩荡荡地流入了葡萄牙。尽管如此，无论流到哪里，它都显得十分悲伤，不愿意用自己的水喂养珍贵的鱼类，只喂养了一些与金色塔霍河里的鱼大不相同的、味道并不鲜美的低档鱼种。我现在对你说的这些话，我的兄弟，我已经对你说过多次了，可你总是不回答，所以，我认为你是不信任我或者并没有听见我说，对此我到底是多么伤心，只有上帝知道。现在我想告诉你一点儿消息。这消息即使不能减轻你的痛苦，至少也不会给你增加任何痛苦。你知道吗，智人梅兰预言的那位能做很多事的伟大骑士，那位曼查的唐吉诃德，现在就站在你面前，你睁眼看看吧。他以比以往任何时候都辉煌的成就在当今之世重振了骑士道，他可以帮助我们解脱魔法。这样伟大的业绩只有这样伟大的人物才能完成。’‘可是如果解除不了魔法，’那位身受重创的杜兰达尔德说道，‘如果解除不了魔法，兄弟，我说呀，咱们别着急，那就洗牌吧①。’说完他就侧过身去，同以前一样默不作声了。 ①当时输了牌的人常这样说，后引申开来，表示不甘心失败，准备从头开始。 “这时忽然传来哭喊声，还伴着深深的叹息和痛苦的抽泣声。我回过头去，透过水晶墙看见两队极其美丽的少女从另一间大厅里依次走出。少女都穿着丧服，头上像土耳其人，一样裹着白头巾。走在队尾的是一位夫人，她那庄重的神态像是夫人。她也穿着黑色的衣服，长长的白纱一直拖到地上，裹头的白巾比其他人都大两倍。她的眉心很窄，鼻子有些塌，偶尔露出那白得像剥了皮的杏仁一样的牙齿，也是稀稀落落，参差不齐。她的手上托着一个薄麻布包，里面隐约可见一块干瘪的东西，想必就是那颗已经干了的心脏。 “蒙特西诺斯告诉我，那队少女是杜兰达尔德和贝莱尔玛的佣人，她们同主人一起被魔法制服在这里。用细麻布托着心脏走在最后的那位夫人就是贝莱尔玛。她带领着那群少女每星期列队走四次，为杜兰达尔德的身体和心脏唱挽歌，确切地说，是哭挽歌。要说她的面目显得有些丑陋，不像传说的那么漂亮，那完全是由于魔法日夜折磨所致，这点从她的黑眼圈和憔悴的面容上就可以看出来。‘你别以为她脸色发黄、眼圈发黑与她月经不调有关，她已经有很多个月，甚至很多年没来月经了。完全是由于手里时刻捧着那颗心，她想起了她那苦命情人的不幸遭遇，自己内心悲痛，才变成了这个样子。否则，她的美貌、风度和精神几乎可以与托博索闻名遐迩的杜尔西内亚相比。’‘别说了，’我说，‘蒙特西诺斯大人，你的事你该怎么讲就怎么讲。你知道，任何比较都是可恶的，因此你不要拿某个人同其他人相比。托博索举世无双的杜尔西内亚就是杜尔西内亚，贝莱尔玛夫人就是贝莱尔玛夫人，她们该是谁就是谁，到此为止吧。’蒙特西诺斯回答说：‘唐吉诃德大人，请原谅，我承认我刚才说贝莱尔玛夫人几乎可以同杜尔西内亚夫人相比是不对的。假如我刚才意识到，我也不知道怎么就忽然意识到了，您就是杜尔西内亚夫人的骑士，我决不会拿贝莱尔玛夫人同她相比，而是拿天来同她相比了。’蒙特西诺斯这么一说我才静下心来。刚才我听他拿贝莱尔玛夫人同杜尔西内亚夫人相比，心里很不痛快。” “不过，更让我惊奇的是，”桑乔说，“您为什么没有骑在那个老东西身上，把他的骨头都打断，把他的胡子揪得一根不剩呢？” “不，桑乔朋友，”唐吉诃德说，“我如果那样做就不对了。我们大家都应该尊重老人，哪怕他们并不是骑士，尤其是要尊重那种既不是骑士又中了魔法的老人。我十分清楚，我们俩在讨论问题时应该平起平坐。” 小伙子这时说道： “这我就不明白了，唐吉诃德大人，您在下面只待了这么短的时间，怎么会看见这么多东西，说了这么多的话？” “我下去有多长时间？”唐吉诃德问。 “一个多小时。” “不可能，”唐吉诃德说，“我在那儿天黑又天亮，天亮又天黑，一共三次。所以，按照我的计算，我在那个咱们的视线看不到、够不着的洞里一共过了三天。” “我的主人说的大概是真的，”桑乔说，“他遇到的那些事都是被魔法变了样的，所以我们觉得是过了一小时，可是在那边却过了三天三夜。” “是这样。”唐吉诃德说。 “您在那段时间里吃东西了吗，大人？”小伙子问。 “一口东西也没吃，”唐吉诃德说，“而且我也不饿，没感觉到饿。” “那些被魔法控制的人呢，也不吃东西？”小伙子问。 “不吃东西。”唐吉诃德说，“他们也没有大便，虽然他们的指甲、胡子和头发似乎都在长。” “那些被魔法制服的人睡觉吗？”桑乔问。 “不，不睡觉。”唐吉诃德说，“至少在我和他们在一起的那三天里，没有一个人合眼，我也没睡。” “俗话说得好，”桑乔说，“近朱者赤，近墨者黑。您和那些不吃不睡的中了魔法的人在一起，您不吃不睡也就不足为奇了。不过请您原谅，我的主人，您刚才在这里说的那些事情，我若是相信了一件，就让我见上帝去……我差点儿说成让我见鬼去了。” “为什么不相信呢？”小伙子问，“难道唐吉诃德大人说谎了吗？即使他想说谎，要编这么一大堆谎话，恐怕时间也来不及呀。” “我觉得我的主人没有说谎。”桑乔说。 “那你觉得是怎么回事呢？”唐吉诃德问。 “我觉得是那个梅兰，或者是对您在下面看到并且谈了话的那些人施了魔法的魔法师们，向您的想象力和记忆力灌输了那座宫殿的事情，所以您刚才才那么说，而且以后也会那么说。” “说来有可能，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“不过，我刚才说的那些都是我亲眼见到、亲手摸到的。蒙特西诺斯还告诉了我许许多多新奇的事情，只不过是现在没有时间讲，等咱们以后在路上我再慢慢给你说。对了，还有一件事，就是在那风景秀丽的原野上，在我眼前忽然闪现出三个农妇，像山羊似的蹦蹦跳跳。我一眼就认出其中一个就是托博索美丽无双的杜尔西内亚，另外两个是咱们在托博索出口处见到的另外两个农妇，对此你又该怎么说呢？我问蒙特西诺斯是否认识她们，蒙特西诺斯说不认识，估计是前几天刚在那儿出现的几位贵夫人，他对此并不感到惊奇，因为在那里还有其他几位前几个世纪和当今世纪的夫人，她们已经被魔法变成了不同的怪模样，其中有他认识的希内夫拉女王及其女仆金塔尼奥娜，她们正在为从布列塔尼来的兰萨罗特斟酒。” 桑乔听主人这么一说，就想到唐吉诃德或者是神志不正常，或者就是高兴过了头。桑乔知道所谓杜尔西内亚中了魔法的事是他一手制造的，他就是那个魔法师。现在，桑乔才完全相信他的主人神志不正常，已经全疯了。桑乔对唐吉诃德说道： “您真是坏时候进洞交坏运，我亲爱的主人，而且糟糕的是碰到了蒙特西诺斯大人，他让您回来变成了这个样子。你没进洞以前神志很正常，就像上帝给了您一个正常的脑袋一样，妙语横生，还不时给人以教诲。可是，现在您胡说八道得简直没边了。” “因为认识你，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“所以你说什么，我都不跟你计较。” “我也不跟您计较，”桑乔说，“哪怕您因为我刚才说的那些话打我或者杀了我。还有一些话，若不是您总纠正我，我也得说呢。咱们现在既然没吵架，那就请您告诉我，您凭什么认出那是杜尔西内亚夫人？如果您同她搭了话，都说了些什么？她又是怎样回答的？” “她穿的就是上次你指给我看时她穿的那身衣服。”唐吉诃德说，“我同她讲话，可她没回答，却转身跑了，快得简直如离弦之箭。我想去追她，可是蒙特西诺斯却劝我别再白费劲，而且我也该出洞了。 “蒙特西诺斯还说以后他会告诉我，贝莱尔玛、杜兰达尔德、他自己以及那里的所有人是如何摆脱魔法的。不过，最让我伤心的是，蒙特西诺斯正同我说着话，我竟没发现是什么时候，不幸的杜尔西内亚的一位女伴已经来到我身边，眼含泪水，颤抖着声音低声对我说：‘我们的杜尔西内亚夫人吻您的手，请您告诉她您的近况；还有，她现在手头紧，请您务必借给她六个雷阿尔，或者您有多少都借给她吧。她以这条白布裙为抵押，会尽快把钱还给您。’我很惊奇，转身问蒙特西诺斯：‘蒙特西诺斯大人，中了魔法的贵人难道也会有手头紧的时候？’蒙特西诺斯答道：‘请相信我，唐吉诃德大人，这种手头紧的情况到处都有，无处不在，即使中了魔法的人也不能幸免。既然杜尔西内亚夫人派人向您借六个雷阿尔，而且抵押品也挺值钱，您就把钱给她吧，看来杜尔西内亚夫人现在确实缺钱。’‘抵押品我不要，’我说，‘而且我也不能如数给她六个雷阿尔，因为我只有四个雷阿尔。’我给了她四个雷阿尔，也就是桑乔你那天给我，准备路上万一遇到穷人乞讨时用的四个雷阿尔。我对杜尔西内亚夫人的女伴说：‘朋友，请告诉你们的夫人，我为她的窘迫从心里感到难过，真想成为富卡尔①来救济她。我还要告诉她的就是，如果我看不到她温柔的目光，听不到她睿智的谈话，我的健康就不会也不该得到保障。所以，我诚心诚意地请求夫人允许这位已被她俘虏了心的辛劳骑士能够见到她，同她说几句话。请告诉她，她也许会在某个她意想不到的时候听到我如何向她信誓旦旦，就像曼图亚侯爵在半山腰遇到他行将咽气的侄子巴尔多维诺斯时，发誓要为侄子报仇时说的那样。侯爵发誓在为侄子报仇之前要食不求精，还有其他一些事情。在为杜尔西内亚夫人解除魔法之前，我不图安逸，要游历世界八方，要比葡萄牙的唐佩德罗王子走的地方还多。’‘这些都是您应该为我们夫人做的。’那个侍女说。 ①富卡尔是卡洛斯一世时居住在西班牙的一个德国富翁，其富裕程度当时在西班牙有口皆碑。 “她接过了四个雷阿尔。不过她没有向我鞠躬行礼，而是向上跳了一下，跳了差不多有两米高。” “噢，神圣的上帝啊！”桑乔这时候大喊一声说道，“世界上真有如此魔力的魔法师和魔法，竟把我本来很精明的主人变得如此疯癫？大人啊大人，请您看在上帝份上，保重自己，保全自己的名声，不要再听信那些让您神经错乱的胡言乱语了！”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4643.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
