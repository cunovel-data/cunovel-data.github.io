{"id":42205,"no":65,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 11","content":"Dejected beyond measure did Don Quixote pursue his journey, turning over in his mind the cruel trick the enchanters had played him in changing his lady Dulcinea into the vile shape of the village lass, nor could he think of any way of restoring her to her original form; and these reflections so absorbed him, that without being aware of it he let go Rocinante’s bridle, and he, perceiving the liberty that was granted him, stopped at every step to crop the fresh grass with which the plain abounded.\n Sancho recalled him from his reverie. “Melancholy, senor,” said he, “was made, not for beasts, but for men; but if men give way to it overmuch they turn to beasts; control yourself, your worship; be yourself again; gather up Rocinante’s reins; cheer up, rouse yourself and show that gallant spirit that knights-errant ought to have. What the devil is this? What weakness is this? Are we here or in France? The devil fly away with all the Dulcineas in the world; for the well-being of a single knight-errant is of more consequence than all the enchantments and transformations on earth.”\n “Hush, Sancho,” said Don Quixote in a weak and faint voice, “hush and utter no blasphemies against that enchanted lady; for I alone am to blame for her misfortune and hard fate; her calamity has come of the hatred the wicked bear me.”\n “So say I,” returned Sancho; “his heart rend in twain, I trow, who saw her once, to see her now.”\n “Thou mayest well say that, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “as thou sawest her in the full perfection of her beauty; for the enchantment does not go so far as to pervert thy vision or hide her loveliness from thee; against me alone and against my eyes is the strength of its venom directed. Nevertheless, there is one thing which has occurred to me, and that is that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me, for, as well as I recollect, thou saidst that her eyes were pearls; but eyes that are like pearls are rather the eyes of a sea-bream than of a lady, and I am persuaded that Dulcinea’s must be green emeralds, full and soft, with two rainbows for eyebrows; take away those pearls from her eyes and transfer them to her teeth; for beyond a doubt, Sancho, thou hast taken the one for the other, the eyes for the teeth.”\n “Very likely,” said Sancho; “for her beauty bewildered me as much as her ugliness did your worship; but let us leave it all to God, who alone knows what is to happen in this vale of tears, in this evil world of ours, where there is hardly a thing to be found without some mixture of wickedness, roguery, and rascality. But one thing, senor, troubles me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle of the street they won’t know her any more than they would my father.”\n “Perhaps, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote, “the enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.”\n “I declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,” said Sancho; “and that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.”\n Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that could be imagined. He who led the mules and acted as carter was a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky, without a tilt or cane roof, and the first figure that presented itself to Don Quixote’s eyes was that of Death itself with a human face; next to it was an angel with large painted wings, and at one side an emperor, with a crown, to all appearance of gold, on his head. At the feet of Death was the god called Cupid, without his bandage, but with his bow, quiver, and arrows; there was also a knight in full armour, except that he had no morion or helmet, but only a hat decked with plumes of divers colours; and along with these there were others with a variety of costumes and faces. All this, unexpectedly encountered, took Don Quixote somewhat aback, and struck terror into the heart of Sancho; but the next instant Don Quixote was glad of it, believing that some new perilous adventure was presenting itself to him, and under this impression, and with a spirit prepared to face any danger, he planted himself in front of the cart, and in a loud and menacing tone, exclaimed, “Carter, or coachman, or devil, or whatever thou art, tell me at once who thou art, whither thou art going, and who these folk are thou carriest in thy wagon, which looks more like Charon’s boat than an ordinary cart.”\n To which the devil, stopping the cart, answered quietly, “Senor, we are players of Angulo el Malo’s company; we have been acting the play of ‘The Cortes of Death’ this morning, which is the octave of Corpus Christi, in a village behind that hill, and we have to act it this afternoon in that village which you can see from this; and as it is so near, and to save the trouble of undressing and dressing again, we go in the costumes in which we perform. That lad there appears as Death, that other as an angel, that woman, the manager’s wife, plays the queen, this one the soldier, that the emperor, and I the devil; and I am one of the principal characters of the play, for in this company I take the leading parts. If you want to know anything more about us, ask me and I will answer with the utmost exactitude, for as I am a devil I am up to everything.”\n “By the faith of a knight-errant,” replied Don Quixote, “when I saw this cart I fancied some great adventure was presenting itself to me; but I declare one must touch with the hand what appears to the eye, if illusions are to be avoided. God speed you, good people; keep your festival, and remember, if you demand of me ought wherein I can render you a service, I will do it gladly and willingly, for from a child I was fond of the play, and in my youth a keen lover of the actor’s art.”\n While they were talking, fate so willed it that one of the company in a mummers’ dress with a great number of bells, and armed with three blown ox-bladders at the end of a stick, joined them, and this merry-andrew approaching Don Quixote, began flourishing his stick and banging the ground with the bladders and cutting capers with great jingling of the bells, which untoward apparition so startled Rocinante that, in spite of Don Quixote’s efforts to hold him in, taking the bit between his teeth he set off across the plain with greater speed than the bones of his anatomy ever gave any promise of.\n \n Sancho, who thought his master was in danger of being thrown, jumped off Dapple, and ran in all haste to help him; but by the time he reached him he was already on the ground, and beside him was Rocinante, who had come down with his master, the usual end and upshot of Rocinante’s vivacity and high spirits. But the moment Sancho quitted his beast to go and help Don Quixote, the dancing devil with the bladders jumped up on Dapple, and beating him with them, more by the fright and the noise than by the pain of the blows, made him fly across the fields towards the village where they were going to hold their festival. Sancho witnessed Dapple’s career and his master’s fall, and did not know which of the two cases of need he should attend to first; but in the end, like a good squire and good servant, he let his love for his master prevail over his affection for his ass; though every time he saw the bladders rise in the air and come down on the hind quarters of his Dapple he felt the pains and terrors of death, and he would have rather had the blows fall on the apples of his own eyes than on the least hair of his ass’s tail. In this trouble and perplexity he came to where Don Quixote lay in a far sorrier plight than he liked, and having helped him to mount Rocinante, he said to him, “Senor, the devil has carried off my Dapple.”\n “What devil?” asked Don Quixote.\n “The one with the bladders,” said Sancho.\n “Then I will recover him,” said Don Quixote, “even if he be shut up with him in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell. Follow me, Sancho, for the cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it I will make good the loss of Dapple.”\n “You need not take the trouble, senor,” said Sancho; “keep cool, for as I now see, the devil has let Dapple go and he is coming back to his old quarters;” and so it turned out, for, having come down with Dapple, in imitation of Don Quixote and Rocinante, the devil made off on foot to the town, and the ass came back to his master.\n “For all that,” said Don Quixote, “it will be well to visit the discourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the cart, even if it were the emperor himself.”\n “Don’t think of it, your worship,” returned Sancho; “take my advice and never meddle with actors, for they are a favoured class; I myself have known an actor taken up for two murders, and yet come off scot-free; remember that, as they are merry folk who give pleasure, everyone favours and protects them, and helps and makes much of them, above all when they are those of the royal companies and under patent, all or most of whom in dress and appearance look like princes.”\n “Still, for all that,” said Don Quixote, “the player devil must not go off boasting, even if the whole human race favours him.”\n So saying, he made for the cart, which was now very near the town, shouting out as he went, “Stay! halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want to teach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires of knights-errant for steeds.”\n So loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heard and understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker’s intention was, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and the emperor, the devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen or the god Cupid stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and formed in line, prepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of their pebbles. Don Quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array with uplifted arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked Rocinante and began to consider in what way he could attack them with the least danger to himself. As he halted Sancho came up, and seeing him disposed to attack this well-ordered squadron, said to him, “It would be the height of madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember, senor, that against sops from the brook, and plenty of them, there is no defensive armour in the world, except to stow oneself away under a brass bell; and besides, one should remember that it is rashness, and not valour, for a single man to attack an army that has Death in it, and where emperors fight in person, with angels, good and bad, to help them; and if this reflection will not make you keep quiet, perhaps it will to know for certain that among all these, though they look like kings, princes, and emperors, there is not a single knight-errant.”\n “Now indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “which may and should turn me from the resolution I had already formed. I cannot and must not draw sword, as I have many a time before told thee, against anyone who is not a dubbed knight; it is for thee, Sancho, if thou wilt, to take vengeance for the wrong done to thy Dapple; and I will help thee from here by shouts and salutary counsels.”\n “There is no occasion to take vengeance on anyone, senor,” replied Sancho; “for it is not the part of good Christians to revenge wrongs; and besides, I will arrange it with my ass to leave his grievance to my good-will and pleasure, and that is to live in peace as long as heaven grants me life.”\n “Well,” said Don Quixote, “if that be thy determination, good Sancho, sensible Sancho, Christian Sancho, honest Sancho, let us leave these phantoms alone and turn to the pursuit of better and worthier adventures; for, from what I see of this country, we cannot fail to find plenty of marvellous ones in it.”\n He at once wheeled about, Sancho ran to take possession of his Dapple, Death and his flying squadron returned to their cart and pursued their journey, and thus the dread adventure of the cart of Death ended happily, thanks to the advice Sancho gave his master; who had, the following day, a fresh adventure, of no less thrilling interest than the last, with an enamoured knight-errant.\n \n 唐吉诃德一边赶路，一边还在想魔法师竟把他的杜尔西内亚夫人变成丑陋农妇的恶作剧，可是他又想不出什么办法来恢复杜尔西内亚原来的模样。想着想着出了神，他不知不觉松开了罗西南多的缰绳。罗西南多感觉到自由了，便走走停停，不时地停下来啃点路边茂盛的青草。桑乔叫唐吉诃德，唐吉诃德才醒过神来。桑乔对他说：\n “大人，牲口从不烦恼，只有人烦恼。不过，人如果烦恼过度，也就成牲口了。您忍着点儿，打起精神，拿起罗西南多的缰绳，振奋起来，表现出游侠骑士的抖擞精神来吧。这算什么？这有什么了不起的？咱们是生活在现实中，还是生活在幻想中？让魔鬼把世界上所有的杜尔西内亚都带走吧，一个游侠骑士的健康比世界上所有的魔法和变化都重要。”\n “住嘴，桑乔。”唐吉诃德有气无力地说道，“我让你住嘴，不许你污蔑那位着了魔法的夫人。她遭受不幸全都是由于我。\n 是那些坏蛋对我的嫉妒造成了她的不幸。”\n “要我说，”桑乔说，“想想她的过去，看看她的现在，有谁能不伤心落泪呢？”\n “你完全可以这样说，桑乔。”唐吉诃德说，“你已经看到了她完美的外貌。魔法并不能迷惑你的视线，掩盖她的美貌。它只能迷惑我，迷惑我的视线，然后它就失去了它的魔力。即使是这样，桑乔，只有一件事让我惦记着，那就是你形容她的美貌时形容得不恰当。例如，假使我没记错的话，你说她的两只眼睛像明珠。只有鱼眼睛像明珠，而不是夫人的眼睛。我觉得杜尔西内亚的眼睛应该像两只祖母绿宝石，另有两只天边弧线般的眉毛。你应该把明珠这个词从她眼睛那儿拿出来，放到她的牙齿那儿去。肯定是你搞错了，桑乔，错把牙齿当成了眼睛。”\n “这完全可能，”桑乔说，“正如她的丑陋面目迷惑了您的眼睛一样，她的美貌也照花了我的眼睛。不过，咱们还是祈求上帝保佑吧，上帝对这苦难尘世上应该发生的事情无所不知。在这个罪恶的世界上，几乎无处不混杂着丑恶、欺骗和卑鄙行径。有一件事最让我担心，我的大人，那就是您打败了某个巨人或骑士后，命令他们去拜见美丽的杜尔西内亚。而这个可怜的巨人，或这个可怜又可悲的骑士，该到哪儿去找到她呢？我仿佛能看到他们在托博索到处寻找杜尔西内亚，可即使在大街上碰到她，他们也认不出来！”\n “桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“也许魔法不会剥夺那些战败后前去拜见杜尔西内亚的巨人和骑士认出她的能力。我要打败一两个巨人，把他们派去，看看他们是否能认出杜尔西内亚来，然后，命令他们向我报告他们所遇到的情况。”\n “我觉得您说得对，大人，”桑乔说，“用这个方法，咱们就可以弄清楚真相了，也就是说，如果只有您认不出她的本来面目，那么您就比她更为不幸。不过，只要杜尔西内亚夫人身体健康，精神愉快，那么咱们尽可以放心，继续征咱们的险，过些时候就会好的。时间是这些病以及其他比这更严重的病的最好医生。”\n 唐吉诃德正要说话，忽然从路上横出一架木板大车，车上有一些形状极其奇怪的人，而且赶着骡子的车夫竟是个丑恶的魔鬼。这辆敞篷车没有围栏。首先映入唐吉诃德眼帘的是一个面如死神的怪物，旁边是一个戴着两只巨型彩色翅膀的天使。她的一侧是一位头顶金制皇冠的皇帝。死神脚边是人们称为丘比特的神。他的眼睛并未蒙着，还带着弓、箭和箭囊。还有一个除了没戴面盔和顶盔以外，真可以说是全副武装的骑士，他的头上只有一顶插满五颜六色羽毛的帽子。这些服装不同而且形态各异的怪物的突然出现使唐吉诃德不免感到有些惊慌，桑乔也从心里感到害怕。不过，后来唐吉诃德又高兴了，他觉得这又是一次新的征险机会。这样一想，他立刻摆出不惧任何危险的架势，挡在车前，大声喝问：\n “车夫，魔鬼，或者不管你是谁，趁早告诉我，你是什么人，到哪儿去，还有车上拉的是什么人！”\n 车夫不慌不忙地停下车，说道：\n “大人，我们是安古洛·埃尔马洛剧团的演员。今天是圣体节的第八天，上午我们在那个小山丘后面的一个地方演了一部劝世短剧①《死亡会议》，下午还得到前面那个地方去演出。因为比较近，我们想免去脱衣穿衣之劳，所以就干脆穿着演出服。那个小伙子演死神；那个女人是剧团领班的夫人，演女王；另外一个人演士兵；那边那个演皇帝；我演魔鬼。我是剧团的重要人物之一，因为我在剧团里经常扮演主要角色。如果您还想了解其他什么情况，就问我好了，我都可以准确地告诉您。我是魔鬼，什么都瞒不住我。”\n “我以骑士的名义发誓，”唐吉诃德说，“刚才我看到这辆车是如此样子，还以为是遇到了什么巨险呢。现在我要说，凡事不能只看外观，要亲手摸一摸才知虚实。愿上帝保佑好人，去演你们的戏吧，如果有什么需要我效劳的尽管吩咐，我十分愿意帮忙。我从小就喜欢戏剧，年轻时总是追着剧团到处跑。”\n ①一种根据《圣经》故事编的剧目。\n 他们正说着话，剧团的一个小丑打扮的人恰巧走过来。他身上带着许多铃铛，手里的一根棍子上还拴着三个吹鼓了的牛膀胱。他来到唐吉诃德面前，挥舞着手里的棍子，把牛膀胱使劲往地上摔，一边还跳着，使身上的铃铛叮当乱响。这下可把罗西南多吓坏了，立刻沿着原野拼命奔跑起来，唐吉诃德使劲勒着它嘴上的缰绳，也不能让它停下来。桑乔怕主人从马上摔下来，连忙从驴背上跳下，跑过去救主人。可是等他赶到时，唐吉诃德已经被摔到地上了。罗西南多也同主人一起摔倒了。每次罗西南多一发狂都是落得这种下场。\n 桑乔刚刚离开驴去救唐吉诃德，那个拿着牛膀胱的小丑就跳到驴背上，而且用牛膀胱拍打驴。用牛膀胱拍打并不痛，可那声音和恐惧却使得驴沿着原野向剧团下午演戏的地方飞奔而去。桑乔见驴跑了，主人又摔到地上，不知先顾哪一头好。不过他毕竟是个好侍从，对主人的忠诚战胜了对驴的感情，尽管他每一次看到牛膀胱在空中举起又落到驴屁股上的时候，都难过得要命。他宁愿那牛膀胱打在自己的眼珠上，也不愿让驴尾巴上哪怕是最细小的毛受到损伤。他又气又急地来到唐吉诃德身旁，见主人摔得够呛，忙扶他骑上罗西南多，然后说道：\n “大人，魔鬼带走了我的驴。”\n “什么魔鬼？”唐吉诃德问。\n “就是那个拿牛膀胱的魔鬼。”桑乔说。\n “他即使把驴藏到地狱最深处，我也要把驴找回来。”唐吉诃德说，“跟我来，桑乔，那大车走不快，我要用他们的骡子抵偿你损失的驴。”\n “已经没有必要了，大人。”桑乔说，“您先消消气，我看见那个人好像已经把驴放了，驴又按原路回来了。”\n 果然如此。原来那个魔鬼同唐吉诃德和罗西南多是一样的下场，跟他骑的驴一起摔倒了。于是，魔鬼步行到前面的村庄去了，驴也回到了主人身边。\n “即使这样，”唐吉诃德说，“我也得从那车上找个人，让他替那魔鬼接受我的惩罚，就是皇帝来也饶不了他。”\n “您可别这么想，”桑乔说，“听我的劝告吧，千万别去碰那些滑稽演员，他们都很受宠。我曾看见一个滑稽演员因为杀死两个人被抓起来，可是后来又放了，什么钱也没花。您该知道，他们是给大家带来欢乐的人，所以大家都偏向他们，保护他们，帮助他们，尊敬他们。特别是那些皇家剧团和得到正式批准的剧团①，所有人，或者大部分人，都生活得很富裕。”\n ①17世纪时，为限制喜剧剧团的发展，仅批准少数几家剧团演戏。但后来这项规定并没有认真执行。\n “虽然如此，”唐吉诃德说，“即使你再夸他，即使大家都护着他，我也饶不了那个魔鬼演员。”\n 说完，唐吉诃德向大车走去，大声说道：\n “站住，等一等，你们这些逗乐的人，我要让你们知道该怎样对待游侠骑士侍从的坐骑。”\n 唐吉诃德的声音很高，车上的人都听到了，也都听明白了。他们明白了唐吉诃德的用意，死神就立刻从车上跳下来，皇帝、魔鬼车夫和天使也跟着跳下来，连女王和丘比特也没有留在车上。大家拿起石头，排成一排，准备用碎石迎接唐吉诃德的进攻。唐吉诃德见他们已经摆出如此壮观的阵势，并且高举着手臂准备将石子狠狠地掷过来，便勒住了罗西南多的缰绳，思索该如何在向他们进攻时减少自己受到的威胁。正在这时，桑乔来了。他见唐吉诃德想对那排列有序的阵势发起攻击，便对唐吉诃德说道：\n “您若是这么做，那就真是疯了。您想想，我的大人，对于如此猛烈的雨点般的石子，世界上还没有任何可以用来防御的手段，除非是躲进铜钟里。而且您还应该考虑到，一个人进攻一支包括死神在内，有皇帝参加战斗，而且善恶天使都为之助威的军队，并不能算是勇敢，那只能算作鲁莽。如果这样还不能让您罢休，那么您应该注意到，那些人当中虽然有国王、君主、皇帝，却没有一个是游侠骑士。”\n “到现在，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“你才让我改变了我本来已不可动摇的决心。我已多次说过，我不能够也不应该向非受封骑士进攻。桑乔，你如果想为你的驴报仇，现在正是时候。我可以在这儿为你呐喊助威。”\n “没必要向任何人报仇，大人。”桑乔说，“报仇并不是善良的基督徒做的事，而且我还要和我的驴讲好，报仇不报仇得听我的，而我主张在老天赐予我们的日子里过得太平无事。”\n “既然你这样决定，”唐吉诃德说，“善良的桑乔，聪明的桑乔，基督徒桑乔，真诚的桑乔，咱们就不理这帮妖魔鬼怪，去寻求更大更有价值的惊险吧。我认为在这个世界上还会有很多神奇的惊险。”\n 说完，唐吉诃德掉转辔头，桑乔也骑上了他的驴。死神和那些人也回到了自己的车上，继续赶路。死神之车的可怕遭遇由于桑乔对主人的善意劝阻而得到了顺利解决。第二天，唐吉诃德又碰到了一个痴情的游侠骑士，其情节同这次一样令人惊奇。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4632.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
