{"id":42214,"no":74,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 20","content":"Scarce had the fair Aurora given bright Phoebus time to dry the liquid pearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays, when Don Quixote, shaking off sloth from his limbs, sprang to his feet and called to his squire Sancho, who was still snoring; seeing which Don Quixote ere he roused him thus addressed him: “Happy thou, above all the dwellers on the face of the earth, that, without envying or being envied, sleepest with tranquil mind, and that neither enchanters persecute nor enchantments affright. Sleep, I say, and will say a hundred times, without any jealous thoughts of thy mistress to make thee keep ceaseless vigils, or any cares as to how thou art to pay the debts thou owest, or find to-morrow’s food for thyself and thy needy little family, to interfere with thy repose. Ambition breaks not thy rest, nor doth this world’s empty pomp disturb thee, for the utmost reach of thy anxiety is to provide for thy ass, since upon my shoulders thou hast laid the support of thyself, the counterpoise and burden that nature and custom have imposed upon masters. The servant sleeps and the master lies awake thinking how he is to feed him, advance him, and reward him. The distress of seeing the sky turn brazen, and withhold its needful moisture from the earth, is not felt by the servant but by the master, who in time of scarcity and famine must support him who has served him in times of plenty and abundance.”\\n\\n \\n\\n To all this Sancho made no reply because he was asleep, nor would he have wakened up so soon as he did had not Don Quixote brought him to his senses with the butt of his lance. He awoke at last, drowsy and lazy, and casting his eyes about in every direction, observed, “There comes, if I don’t mistake, from the quarter of that arcade a steam and a smell a great deal more like fried rashers than galingale or thyme; a wedding that begins with smells like that, by my faith, ought to be plentiful and unstinting.”\\n\\n “Have done, thou glutton,” said Don Quixote; “come, let us go and witness this bridal, and see what the rejected Basilio does.”\\n\\n “Let him do what he likes,” returned Sancho; “be he not poor, he would marry Quiteria. To make a grand match for himself, and he without a farthing; is there nothing else? Faith, senor, it’s my opinion the poor man should be content with what he can get, and not go looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea. I will bet my arm that Camacho could bury Basilio in reals; and if that be so, as no doubt it is, what a fool Quiteria would be to refuse the fine dresses and jewels Camacho must have given her and will give her, and take Basilio’s bar-throwing and sword-play. They won’t give a pint of wine at the tavern for a good cast of the bar or a neat thrust of the sword. Talents and accomplishments that can’t be turned into money, let Count Dirlos have them; but when such gifts fall to one that has hard cash, I wish my condition of life was as becoming as they are. On a good foundation you can raise a good building, and the best foundation in the world is money.”\\n\\n “For God’s sake, Sancho,” said Don Quixote here, “stop that harangue; it is my belief, if thou wert allowed to continue all thou beginnest every instant, thou wouldst have no time left for eating or sleeping; for thou wouldst spend it all in talking.”\\n\\n “If your worship had a good memory,” replied Sancho, “you would remember the articles of our agreement before we started from home this last time; one of them was that I was to be let say all I liked, so long as it was not against my neighbour or your worship’s authority; and so far, it seems to me, I have not broken the said article.”\\n\\n “I remember no such article, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “and even if it were so, I desire you to hold your tongue and come along; for the instruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the valleys again, and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of the morning, and not in the heat of the afternoon.”\\n\\n Sancho did as his master bade him, and putting the saddle on Rocinante and the pack-saddle on Dapple, they both mounted and at a leisurely pace entered the arcade. The first thing that presented itself to Sancho’s eyes was a whole ox spitted on a whole elm tree, and in the fire at which it was to be roasted there was burning a middling-sized mountain of faggots, and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in the ordinary mould of common pots, for they were six half wine-jars, each fit to hold the contents of a slaughter-house; they swallowed up whole sheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign of them than if they were pigeons. Countless were the hares ready skinned and the plucked fowls that hung on the trees for burial in the pots, numberless the wildfowl and game of various sorts suspended from the branches that the air might keep them cool. Sancho counted more than sixty wine skins of over six gallons each, and all filled, as it proved afterwards, with generous wines. There were, besides, piles of the whitest bread, like the heaps of corn one sees on the threshing-floors. There was a wall made of cheeses arranged like open brick-work, and two cauldrons full of oil, bigger than those of a dyer’s shop, served for cooking fritters, which when fried were taken out with two mighty shovels, and plunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by. Of cooks and cook-maids there were over fifty, all clean, brisk, and blithe. In the capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking-pigs, which, sewn up there, served to give it tenderness and flavour. The spices of different kinds did not seem to have been bought by the pound but by the quarter, and all lay open to view in a great chest. In short, all the preparations made for the wedding were in rustic style, but abundant enough to feed an army.\\n\\n \\n\\n Sancho observed all, contemplated all, and everything won his heart. The first to captivate and take his fancy were the pots, out of which he would have very gladly helped himself to a moderate pipkinful; then the wine skins secured his affections; and lastly, the produce of the frying-pans, if, indeed, such imposing cauldrons may be called frying-pans; and unable to control himself or bear it any longer, he approached one of the busy cooks and civilly but hungrily begged permission to soak a scrap of bread in one of the pots; to which the cook made answer, “Brother, this is not a day on which hunger is to have any sway, thanks to the rich Camacho; get down and look about for a ladle and skim off a hen or two, and much good may they do you.”\\n\\n “I don’t see one,” said Sancho.\\n\\n “Wait a bit,” said the cook; “sinner that I am! how particular and bashful you are!” and so saying, he seized a bucket and plunging it into one of the half jars took up three hens and a couple of geese, and said to Sancho, “Fall to, friend, and take the edge off your appetite with these skimmings until dinner-time comes.”\\n\\n \\n\\n “I have nothing to put them in,” said Sancho.\\n\\n “Well then,” said the cook, “take spoon and all; for Camacho’s wealth and happiness furnish everything.”\\n\\n While Sancho fared thus, Don Quixote was watching the entrance, at one end of the arcade, of some twelve peasants, all in holiday and gala dress, mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome field trappings and a number of little bells attached to their petrals, who, marshalled in regular order, ran not one but several courses over the meadow, with jubilant shouts and cries of “Long live Camacho and Quiteria! he as rich as she is fair; and she the fairest on earth!”\\n\\n Hearing this, Don Quixote said to himself, “It is easy to see these folk have never seen my Dulcinea del Toboso; for if they had they would be more moderate in their praises of this Quiteria of theirs.”\\n\\n Shortly after this, several bands of dancers of various sorts began to enter the arcade at different points, and among them one of sword-dancers composed of some four-and-twenty lads of gallant and high-spirited mien, clad in the finest and whitest of linen, and with handkerchiefs embroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one of those on the mares asked an active youth who led them if any of the dancers had been wounded. “As yet, thank God, no one has been wounded,” said he, “we are all safe and sound;” and he at once began to execute complicated figures with the rest of his comrades, with so many turns and so great dexterity, that although Don Quixote was well used to see dances of the same kind, he thought he had never seen any so good as this. He also admired another that came in composed of fair young maidens, none of whom seemed to be under fourteen or over eighteen years of age, all clad in green stuff, with their locks partly braided, partly flowing loose, but all of such bright gold as to vie with the sunbeams, and over them they wore garlands of jessamine, roses, amaranth, and honeysuckle. At their head were a venerable old man and an ancient dame, more brisk and active, however, than might have been expected from their years. The notes of a Zamora bagpipe accompanied them, and with modesty in their countenances and in their eyes, and lightness in their feet, they looked the best dancers in the world.\\n\\n \\n\\n Following these there came an artistic dance of the sort they call “speaking dances.” It was composed of eight nymphs in two files, with the god Cupid leading one and Interest the other, the former furnished with wings, bow, quiver and arrows, the latter in a rich dress of gold and silk of divers colours. The nymphs that followed Love bore their names written on white parchment in large letters on their backs. “Poetry” was the name of the first, “Wit” of the second, “Birth” of the third, and “Valour” of the fourth. Those that followed Interest were distinguished in the same way; the badge of the first announced “Liberality,” that of the second “Largess,” the third “Treasure,” and the fourth “Peaceful Possession.” In front of them all came a wooden castle drawn by four wild men, all clad in ivy and hemp stained green, and looking so natural that they nearly terrified Sancho. On the front of the castle and on each of the four sides of its frame it bore the inscription “Castle of Caution.” Four skillful tabor and flute players accompanied them, and the dance having been opened, Cupid, after executing two figures, raised his eyes and bent his bow against a damsel who stood between the turrets of the castle, and thus addressed her:\\n\\n I am the mighty God whose sway\\n\\n Is potent over land and sea.\\n\\n The heavens above us own me; nay,\\n\\n The shades below acknowledge me.\\n\\n I know not fear, I have my will,\\n\\n Whate’er my whim or fancy be;\\n\\n For me there’s no impossible,\\n\\n I order, bind, forbid, set free.\\n\\n Having concluded the stanza he discharged an arrow at the top of the castle, and went back to his place. Interest then came forward and went through two more figures, and as soon as the tabors ceased, he said:\\n\\n But mightier than Love am I,\\n\\n Though Love it be that leads me on,\\n\\n Than mine no lineage is more high,\\n\\n Or older, underneath the sun.\\n\\n To use me rightly few know how,\\n\\n To act without me fewer still,\\n\\n For I am Interest, and I vow\\n\\n For evermore to do thy will.\\n\\n Interest retired, and Poetry came forward, and when she had gone through her figures like the others, fixing her eyes on the damsel of the castle, she said:\\n\\n With many a fanciful conceit,\\n\\n Fair Lady, winsome Poesy\\n\\n Her soul, an offering at thy feet,\\n\\n Presents in sonnets unto thee.\\n\\n If thou my homage wilt not scorn,\\n\\n Thy fortune, watched by envious eyes,\\n\\n On wings of poesy upborne\\n\\n Shall be exalted to the skies.\\n\\n Poetry withdrew, and on the side of Interest Liberality advanced, and after having gone through her figures, said:\\n\\n To give, while shunning each extreme,\\n\\n The sparing hand, the over-free,\\n\\n Therein consists, so wise men deem,\\n\\n The virtue Liberality.\\n\\n But thee, fair lady, to enrich,\\n\\n Myself a prodigal I’ll prove,\\n\\n A vice not wholly shameful, which\\n\\n May find its fair excuse in love.\\n\\n In the same manner all the characters of the two bands advanced and retired, and each executed its figures, and delivered its verses, some of them graceful, some burlesque, but Don Quixote’s memory (though he had an excellent one) only carried away those that have been just quoted. All then mingled together, forming chains and breaking off again with graceful, unconstrained gaiety; and whenever Love passed in front of the castle he shot his arrows up at it, while Interest broke gilded pellets against it. At length, after they had danced a good while, Interest drew out a great purse, made of the skin of a large brindled cat and to all appearance full of money, and flung it at the castle, and with the force of the blow the boards fell asunder and tumbled down, leaving the damsel exposed and unprotected. Interest and the characters of his band advanced, and throwing a great chain of gold over her neck pretended to take her and lead her away captive, on seeing which, Love and his supporters made as though they would release her, the whole action being to the accompaniment of the tabors and in the form of a regular dance. The wild men made peace between them, and with great dexterity readjusted and fixed the boards of the castle, and the damsel once more ensconced herself within; and with this the dance wound up, to the great enjoyment of the beholders.\\n\\n Don Quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed and arranged it. She replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had a nice taste in devising things of the sort. “I will lay a wager,” said Don Quixote, “that the same bachelor or beneficiary is a greater friend of Camacho’s than of Basilio’s, and that he is better at satire than at vespers; he has introduced the accomplishments of Basilio and the riches of Camacho very neatly into the dance.” Sancho Panza, who was listening to all this, exclaimed, “The king is my cock; I stick to Camacho.” “It is easy to see thou art a clown, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and one of that sort that cry ‘Long life to the conqueror.’”\\n\\n “I don’t know of what sort I am,” returned Sancho, “but I know very well I’ll never get such elegant skimmings off Basilio’s pots as these I have got off Camacho’s;” and he showed him the bucketful of geese and hens, and seizing one began to eat with great gaiety and appetite, saying, “A fig for the accomplishments of Basilio! As much as thou hast so much art thou worth, and as much as thou art worth so much hast thou. As a grandmother of mine used to say, there are only two families in the world, the Haves and the Haven’ts; and she stuck to the Haves; and to this day, Senor Don Quixote, people would sooner feel the pulse of ‘Have,’ than of ‘Know;’ an ass covered with gold looks better than a horse with a pack-saddle. So once more I say I stick to Camacho, the bountiful skimmings of whose pots are geese and hens, hares and rabbits; but of Basilio’s , if any ever come to hand, or even to foot, they’ll be only rinsings.”\\n\\n “Hast thou finished thy harangue, Sancho?” said Don Quixote. “Of course I have finished it,” replied Sancho, “because I see your worship takes offence at it; but if it was not for that, there was work enough cut out for three days.”\\n\\n “God grant I may see thee dumb before I die, Sancho,” said Don Quixote.\\n\\n “At the rate we are going,” said Sancho, “I’ll be chewing clay before your worship dies; and then, maybe, I’ll be so dumb that I’ll not say a word until the end of the world, or, at least, till the day of judgment.”\\n\\n “Even should that happen, O Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “thy silence will never come up to all thou hast talked, art talking, and wilt talk all thy life; moreover, it naturally stands to reason, that my death will come before thine; so I never expect to see thee dumb, not even when thou art drinking or sleeping, and that is the utmost I can say.”\\n\\n “In good faith, senor,” replied Sancho, “there’s no trusting that fleshless one, I mean Death, who devours the lamb as soon as the sheep, and, as I have heard our curate say, treads with equal foot upon the lofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of the poor. That lady is more mighty than dainty, she is no way squeamish, she devours all and is ready for all, and fills her alforjas with people of all sorts, ages, and ranks. She is no reaper that sleeps out the noontide; at all times she is reaping and cutting down, as well the dry grass as the green; she never seems to chew, but bolts and swallows all that is put before her, for she has a canine appetite that is never satisfied; and though she has no belly, she shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drink the lives of all that live, as one would drink a jug of cold water.”\\n\\n “Say no more, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at this; “don’t try to better it, and risk a fall; for in truth what thou hast said about death in thy rustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said. I tell thee, Sancho, if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit, thou mightst take a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons.” “He preaches well who lives well,” said Sancho, “and I know no more theology than that.”\\n\\n “Nor needst thou,” said Don Quixote, “but I cannot conceive or make out how it is that, the fear of God being the beginning of wisdom, thou, who art more afraid of a lizard than of him, knowest so much.”\\n\\n “Pass judgment on your chivalries, senor,” returned Sancho, “and don’t set yourself up to judge of other men’s fears or braveries, for I am as good a fearer of God as my neighbours; but leave me to despatch these skimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that we shall be called to account for in the other world;” and so saying, he began a fresh attack on the bucket, with such a hearty appetite that he aroused Don Quixote’s , who no doubt would have helped him had he not been prevented by what must be told farther on.\\n\\n \\n\\n 曙光初照，太阳神还没来得及以炽热的光芒揩干它金发上的露珠，唐吉诃德就活动着懒洋洋的四肢，站了起来，去叫桑乔。桑乔此时仍鼾声不止。唐吉诃德见状没有马上叫醒他，只是对他说：\\n\\n “你呀，真是世界上最有福气的人。你心绪平静，不用嫉妒别人，也没有别人嫉妒你；魔法师不跟你捣乱，魔法也不找你的麻烦！睡吧，我再说一遍，我可以再说一百遍。你不必担心自己的老婆，不必操心如何还债，不必为第二天干什么来养活你和你那小小的苦难家庭而彻夜不眠。你不必由于野心勃勃而蠢蠢欲动，也没有什么虚幻可以让你烦躁不安；你的愿望从来没有超出喂养你的驴的范围，而供养你的担子则落到了我的肩上，这种负担从来都是自然而然地落到主人身上的。仆人睡了，主人却在熬夜，得考虑如何养活仆人，如何改善他的条件，如何奖赏他。老天冰冷着脸不下雨，仆人不愁，主人却心忧。丰年仆人服侍主人，荒年主人得养活仆人。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德说了半天，桑乔并不理会，他还睡着呢。若不是唐吉诃德用矛头把他弄醒，他肯定不会马上起来。桑乔好不容易才起来了。他睡眼惺忪地、懒洋洋地环顾四周，说道：\\n\\n “如果我没搞错的话，从那个树枝棚方向传来了一股用灯心草和百里香烤肉条的气味。我在心里担保，开始就是这么好的味道，那婚宴一定很丰盛。”\\n\\n “够了，馋嘴！”唐吉诃德说，“过来，咱们去看看婚礼，看看那个受到冷落的巴西利奥会干什么吧。”\\n\\n “他爱干什么就干什么吧，”桑乔说，“要不是他穷，他现在就同基特里亚结婚了。他身无分文还想高攀？依我看，大人，穷人就应该知足常乐，别异想天开。我敢用我的一只胳臂打赌，卡马乔完全能够用钱把巴西利奥埋起来。如果是这样，而且也应该是这样，那么，若是基特里亚回绝卡马乔送给她的华丽的衣服和首饰，因为卡马乔肯定会送给她的，却选择巴西利奥的掷棒和耍黑剑，那她就真是个大笨蛋了。掷棒掷得再好，击剑时假动作做得再漂亮，也换不来酒店里的一杯葡萄酒。技巧和水平卖不了钱，迪尔洛斯伯爵再有水平也赚不了钱。一个有水平的人如果再有钱，那才是像样的日子。在良好的基础上才盖得起高水平的大楼来，而世界上最坚实的基础就是钱。”\\n\\n “看在上帝份上，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“你赶紧住嘴吧。我相信，如果允许你到处都说起来没个完，你恐怕连吃饭和睡觉的时间都不会有，得把所有的时间都用来说话了。”\\n\\n “如果您记性不错，”桑乔说，“大概还记得，咱们这次出来之前曾有约定，其中一条就是让我任意说话，只要我不攻击别人，不冒犯您的尊严。直到现在，我觉得我还没有违犯这项约定。”\\n\\n “我不记得有这条约定，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“即使有，我也要让你住嘴。你听，昨天晚上咱们听到过的那些乐器演奏的乐曲，今天又在村子里响起来了，婚礼肯定是在凉爽的上午，而不是在炎热的下午举行。”\\n\\n 桑乔按照主人的吩咐办了。他给罗西南多备了鞍，又给他的驴套上了驮鞍，两个人骑着牲口慢慢走进了树枝棚。首先映入桑乔眼帘的是在一棵当作烤肉叉用的榆树上正烤着整只的小牛，用来烤肉的木柴堆起来足有半座小山高。火周围还吊着六只锅，不过这可不是六只普通的锅，而是六个大坛子，每只锅都能盛下一个屠宰场的肉。一只只整羊放进去，就像放进几只雏鸽似的。无数只已经剥了皮的兔子和褪了毛的鸡挂在树上等待下锅，各种各样的飞禽猎物不计其数，也都挂在树上晾着。能装两阿罗瓦酒的酒囊，桑乔数了数，足有六十多个，而且后来知道里面都装满了上等葡萄酒。成堆的白面包堆得像打麦场上的麦垛一样高，奶酪就像砖头那样码在一起，形成了一堵墙，两口比染锅还大的油锅正在炸面食，两只特号的大铲子把炸好的面食从油锅里捞出来，放进旁边一口用来裹蜜的大锅里。五十多个男女厨师穿得干干净净，既高兴又利索地忙碌着。在破开的小牛肚子里，缝着十二只嫩嫩的猪崽，这样烤出来的牛肉更加肉嫩味美。各种各样的调料看来不是论磅，而是论阿罗瓦买来的，都放在一个敞开的大箱子里。总之，婚礼的场面虽然简朴，但食物极其丰盛，足够一支军队吃的。\\n\\n 桑乔看着这一切，欣赏着这一切，喜欢上了这一切。他首先被那些大锅吸引住了，很想先吃它半锅；接着，他又馋上了酒囊；最后，他盯上了煎锅里的东西，假如那些大肚子锅能够叫做煎锅的话。他实在忍不住，而且什么也干不下去了，就跑到一个正在忙碌的厨师身旁，客客气气地解释了一番自己的饿劲儿，请求厨师允许自己讨点锅里的汤来泡泡自己带的干面包。\\n\\n 厨师回答说：\\n\\n “兄弟，感谢富豪卡马乔，今天不分什么穷人不穷人了。你来，找找看有没有大勺子，先捞一两只鸡，好好吃一顿吧。”\\n\\n “我找不到勺子。”桑乔说。\\n\\n “你等等，”厨师说，“我的天，你这个人办事真够磨蹭的，真没用！”\\n\\n 说完他抓起一只锅，从一个大坛子里舀出三只鸡和两只鹅，对桑乔说：\\n\\n “吃吧，朋友，先吃这点儿当点心，一会儿再吃正餐。”\\n\\n “我没家伙拿呀。”桑乔说。\\n\\n “你连锅端走吧，”厨师说，“卡马乔有钱，今天又高兴，不在乎这点儿。”\\n\\n 桑乔在这边忙活的时候，唐吉诃德正在那边观看十二个农夫骑着十二匹马进了树枝棚。十二匹骏马都配着华丽鲜艳的马具，胸带上戴着铃铛。十二个人都穿着节日的盛装，井然有序地排成几行绕着草地慢跑，边跑边欢呼：\\n\\n “卡马乔和基特里亚万岁！郎财女貌，基特里亚是世界上最美丽的女人！”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德心里想：看来，他们肯定没见过托博索的杜尔西内亚。如果他们见过，就不会这样赞颂这个基特里亚了。\\n\\n 很快又有各种各样的舞队从四面八方走进了树枝棚，其中有一支是剑舞队，二十四个英姿勃勃的小伙子穿着又细又白的麻布衣，头上戴着五颜六色的细绸巾。一伙灵巧的少年在前面引路。骑马的一个人问舞队中是否有谁受了伤。\\n\\n “感谢上帝，到现在我们还没有任何人受伤，大家都挺好的。”\\n\\n 然后，他进入伙伴们的队伍里，灵巧地转着圈。唐吉诃德虽然见过这种舞蹈，但像今天跳得这么出色，他还是头一回看到。他觉得另一队风姿如玉的姑娘跳得也很不错。那些姑娘都很年轻，年龄都在二十四岁和十八岁之间，衣服都是帕尔米亚呢绒做的，头发有一部分扎成辫子，有一部分散披着，都是金黄色的，完全可以与太阳争辉。头上戴着用茉莉花、玫瑰、苋草和忍冬藤编成的花环。领队的是一位令人尊敬的老头和一位老妇，但是他们跳得轻松自如，远不像他们那个年纪的人。大家随着萨莫拉风笛的旋律起舞，表情庄重，步履轻盈，堪称是世界上最优秀的舞蹈表演家。\\n\\n 接着是一支技巧舞队和一支被称为“告示舞”的舞队。八个仙女分成两队，一队由爱神丘比特率领，另一队由财神打头。爱神的身上有两只翅膀，还带着弓、箭和箭袋，财神则穿金戴绸，五彩缤纷。跟随爱神的仙女每人背上都有一张白羊皮纸，分别用大字写着自己的名字。第一个仙女的名字是“诗艺”，第二个叫“才智”，第三个是“豪门”，第四个称为“勇敢”。财神身后跟随的仙女们也同样背着自己的名字。“慷慨”是第一个仙女的名字，“赠与”是第二个仙女的名字，第三个仙女叫“财富”，第四个叫“享受”。队伍最前面是由四个野人拖着的一座木制城堡。野人身上裹着染成绿色的麻布，再缠上长春藤。他们装扮得太逼真了，把桑乔吓了一跳。城堡的正门上方和城堡的四面都写着“谦逊之堡”的字样，四个鼓乐手和笛手演奏着乐曲。丘比特开始跳舞。他跳了两个组合动作，然后抬头张弓，向站在城堞之间的一位少女说道：\\n\\n 无论是在天空、陆地，\\n\\n 还是在波涛起伏的辽阔海洋，\\n\\n 或是在恐怖的阴间地府，\\n\\n 我都是\\n\\n 无所不能的神祇。\\n\\n 我从不知道什么叫畏惧。\\n\\n 人所不能，\\n\\n 我能实现；\\n\\n 人之所能，\\n\\n 我也能遂心任意。\\n\\n 念完诗后，他向城堡上射了一箭，然后退回原位。接着是财神出场。鼓乐声停止了，只听财神说道：\\n\\n 我比爱神更强，\\n\\n 爱神是我先导。\\n\\n 天上地下万物，\\n\\n 惟我门第最高，\\n\\n 最知名，最兀傲。\\n\\n 我就是财神，\\n\\n 但很少有人利用得好，\\n\\n 若无我能成事，那才蹊跷。\\n\\n 我可保佑你，\\n\\n 阿门，万事皆美妙。\\n\\n 财神退了下去，“诗艺”出场。她像其他几个人一样做了几个动作，然后眼睛盯着城堡上的少女，说道：\\n\\n 温情的才思，\\n\\n 温情的诗艺。\\n\\n 姑娘，我用我心\\n\\n 给你送去千首\\n\\n 孤傲高洁的诗。\\n\\n 即使你的佳运\\n\\n 遭到其他女人妒忌，\\n\\n 只要你不嫌弃，\\n\\n 我会让你升华到\\n\\n 超越月晕凌空立。\\n\\n “诗艺”让开后，“慷慨”从财神身旁走出来。她做了几个动作，然后说道：\\n\\n 人们称我为慷慨，\\n\\n 只要我不是极度挥霍。\\n\\n 据说挥霍可以\\n\\n 把人的意志消磨。\\n\\n 然而为了你更加显贵，\\n\\n 我偏要极度挥霍，\\n\\n 尽管这是坏毛病，却也高尚，\\n\\n 满腔情爱\\n\\n 可借此尽情表露。\\n\\n 两队的各个角色就这样依次出场，每个人都做几个动作，再念几首诗，有的诗高雅华丽，有的诗令人捧腹。唐吉诃德的记性虽好，也只记住了前面说到的那几首。后来，所有的人都混在一起，分分合合，组成了各种美丽奔放的图案。爱神每次从城堡前面经过，就向城堡上射一箭；而财神从城堡前经过，就掷一个空心的金色彩球①，彩球落在城堡上就爆裂了。跳了好一阵后，财神掏出一个猫皮钱袋②，看样子里面装满了钱，把它也抛到城堡上。随着钱袋坠落，搭建城堡的木板散开，城堡里的少女暴露无遗。财神偕同他那队仙女，上前把一条大金链套到了少女的脖子上，表示已经俘虏并征服了她。爱神和他的仙女们看见了，连忙去抢她。所有这些表演都是载歌载舞，在鼓乐的伴奏下进行的。大家劝说四个野人停止了争斗。四个野人又把搭城堡的木板重新搭建起来，少女又像刚才一样重新藏在里面。大家高高兴兴地看着舞蹈表演全部结束。\\n\\n ①一种游戏。彩球如桔子大小，双方互掷，并用盾牌击碎对方的彩球。\\n\\n ②一种不将猫肚子剖开，而将猫皮完整剥下，用来装钱的皮袋。\\n\\n 唐吉诃德问一个仙女，是谁设计组织了这场舞蹈表演。仙女说是村里一位义演经纪人，他很善于编排这种活动。\\n\\n “我敢打赌，”唐吉诃德说，“这个教士或义演经纪人亲卡马乔肯定胜过亲巴西利奥，而且更善于当讽刺剧的编导，而不是当主持晚祷的教士。舞蹈很好地表现了巴西利奥的才智和卡马乔的财富。”\\n\\n 这些话桑乔全听到了。桑乔说道：\\n\\n “胜者为王，我站在卡马乔一边。”\\n\\n “别说了，”唐吉诃德说，“桑乔，你真像一个势利小人，是那种喊‘胜者万岁’的人。”\\n\\n “我到底属于哪种人我不知道。”桑乔说，“我只知道，从巴西利奥的锅里绝不会得到今天从卡马乔这儿得到的这么多吃的。”\\n\\n 桑乔把盛满鹅和鸡的锅拿给唐吉诃德看，抓起一只鸡，津津有味地吃起来，并且说道：\\n\\n “巴西利奥完了，就因为他穷！你有多少钱就值多少钱。世界上的人只有两类，就像我祖母说的，那就是有钱人和没钱人。她站在有钱人那边。这年头儿，看什么都得先掂量掂量。一头披金的驴胜过一匹套着驮鞍的马。所以，我再说一遍，我站在卡马乔一边，他的锅里有的是鹅、鸡、兔子什么的。而在巴西利奥的锅里能得到什么呢？只剩下汤了。”\\n\\n “你还有完没完了，桑乔？”唐吉诃德问。\\n\\n “没完也得完呀，”桑乔说，“我已经看出来，您特别不爱听。若不是您打断我的话，我可以说三天。”\\n\\n “上帝保佑，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“让我在死之前看到你成为哑巴！”\\n\\n “要像咱们现在这个样子，”桑乔说，“不等您死，我就先入土了。那么，在世界末日到来之前，至少是最后审判日①到来之前，我肯定说不了话啦。”\\n\\n ①宗教中宣布世界末日来临的日子。\\n\\n “就算是世界末日来临了，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“你也不会住嘴。你过去说，现在说，要说一辈子。而且，我死在你前面也是理所当然的事，所以，我从来不会想到你有不说话的时候，哪怕在你喝酒和睡觉的时候。这点我可以肯定。”\\n\\n “说实在的，大人，”桑乔说，“对死神不必抱什么幻想，她是大羊小羊一样吃。我听我们的神甫讲过，无论是国王的深宅，还是穷人的茅屋，她的脚都一律踏平。这位老夫人一点儿也不娇气，没有什么她不敢的。她什么都敢吃，什么都敢做。无论什么人，不分年龄和地位，她统统装入自己的口袋。这位收割者从来不睡觉，总是不分时辰地收割，无论是干草还是绿苗都一律割掉。她吃东西似乎不嚼，把她能找到的东西都吞下去，像只饿狗似的，总是吃不够。虽然她并不是大腹便便，却总像患了水肿一般，焦渴难耐，就像人喝整坛子凉水一样，把所有有生命的东西都喝下去。”\\n\\n “别再说了，桑乔，”唐吉诃德这时说，“你好自为之，适可而止吧。就冲你对死亡发表的这一番大实话，真可以说你是个杰出的说教者了。我告诉你，桑乔，你天生就聪明，完全可以随身带个布道台，到世界各地去慷慨陈词了。”\\n\\n “别的我不懂，”桑乔说，“我只知道谁讲得好，谁就活得好。”\\n\\n “你也不用再懂别的了。”唐吉诃德说，“不过我不明白，对上帝的惧怕本来是智慧的源泉，可你不怕上帝怕蜥蜴，却知道得那么多。”\\n\\n “大人，关于您的骑士道，您愿意怎么办就怎么办。”桑乔说，“至于别人到底是惧怕还是勇敢，您就别操心了。我像所有的孩子一样惧怕上帝，这点我自己知道。您先让我把这些吃的消灭了吧，别的全是空话，等我们来世再说也行。”\\n\\n 说完桑乔又端着那只诱人的锅吃起来，这也激起了唐吉诃德的胃口。若不是由于下面又发生了事情，他肯定也会跟着吃起来。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4641.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
