{"id":42255,"no":115,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 61","content":"Don Quixote passed three days and three nights with Roque, and had he passed three hundred years he would have found enough to observe and wonder at in his mode of life. At daybreak they were in one spot, at dinner-time in another; sometimes they fled without knowing from whom, at other times they lay in wait, not knowing for what. They slept standing, breaking their slumbers to shift from place to place. There was nothing but sending out spies and scouts, posting sentinels and blowing the matches of harquebusses, though they carried but few, for almost all used flintlocks. Roque passed his nights in some place or other apart from his men, that they might not know where he was, for the many proclamations the viceroy of Barcelona had issued against his life kept him in fear and uneasiness, and he did not venture to trust anyone, afraid that even his own men would kill him or deliver him up to the authorities; of a truth, a weary miserable life! At length, by unfrequented roads, short cuts, and secret paths, Roque, Don Quixote, and Sancho, together with six squires, set out for Barcelona. They reached the strand on Saint John’s Eve during the night; and Roque, after embracing Don Quixote and Sancho (to whom he presented the ten crowns he had promised but had not until then given), left them with many expressions of good-will on both sides.\n Roque went back, while Don Quixote remained on horseback, just as he was, waiting for day, and it was not long before the countenance of the fair Aurora began to show itself at the balconies of the east, gladdening the grass and flowers, if not the ear, though to gladden that too there came at the same moment a sound of clarions and drums, and a din of bells, and a tramp, tramp, and cries of “Clear the way there!” of some runners, that seemed to issue from the city.\n \n The dawn made way for the sun that with a face broader than a buckler began to rise slowly above the low line of the horizon; Don Quixote and Sancho gazed all round them; they beheld the sea, a sight until then unseen by them; it struck them as exceedingly spacious and broad, much more so than the lakes of Ruidera which they had seen in La Mancha. They saw the galleys along the beach, which, lowering their awnings, displayed themselves decked with streamers and pennons that trembled in the breeze and kissed and swept the water, while on board the bugles, trumpets, and clarions were sounding and filling the air far and near with melodious warlike notes. Then they began to move and execute a kind of skirmish upon the calm water, while a vast number of horsemen on fine horses and in showy liveries, issuing from the city, engaged on their side in a somewhat similar movement. The soldiers on board the galleys kept up a ceaseless fire, which they on the walls and forts of the city returned, and the heavy cannon rent the air with the tremendous noise they made, to which the gangway guns of the galleys replied. The bright sea, the smiling earth, the clear air — though at times darkened by the smoke of the guns — all seemed to fill the whole multitude with unexpected delight. Sancho could not make out how it was that those great masses that moved over the sea had so many feet.\n And now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts and outlandish cries and cheers to where Don Quixote stood amazed and wondering; and one of them, he to whom Roque had sent word, addressing him exclaimed, “Welcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosure of all knight-errantry in its widest extent! Welcome, I say, valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha; not the false, the fictitious, the apocryphal, that these latter days have offered us in lying histories, but the true, the legitimate, the real one that Cide Hamete Benengeli, flower of historians, has described to us!”\n Don Quixote made no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one, but wheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting round Don Quixote, who, turning to Sancho, said, “These gentlemen have plainly recognised us; I will wager they have read our history, and even that newly printed one by the Aragonese.”\n The cavalier who had addressed Don Quixote again approached him and said, “Come with us, Senor Don Quixote, for we are all of us your servants and great friends of Roque Guinart’s ;” to which Don Quixote returned, “If courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, is daughter or very nearly akin to the great Roque’s ; carry me where you please; I will have no will but yours, especially if you deign to employ it in your service.”\n \n The cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closing in around him, they set out with him for the city, to the music of the clarions and the drums. As they were entering it, the wicked one, who is the author of all mischief, and the boys who are wickeder than the wicked one, contrived that a couple of these audacious irrepressible urchins should force their way through the crowd, and lifting up, one of them Dapple’s tail and the other Rocinante’s, insert a bunch of furze under each. The poor beasts felt the strange spurs and added to their anguish by pressing their tails tight, so much so that, cutting a multitude of capers, they flung their masters to the ground. Don Quixote, covered with shame and out of countenance, ran to pluck the plume from his poor jade’s tail, while Sancho did the same for Dapple. His conductors tried to punish the audacity of the boys, but there was no possibility of doing so, for they hid themselves among the hundreds of others that were following them. Don Quixote and Sancho mounted once more, and with the same music and acclamations reached their conductor’s house, which was large and stately, that of a rich gentleman, in short; and there for the present we will leave them, for such is Cide Hamete’s pleasure.\n \n 以及其他不新奇但却真实的事情\n 唐吉诃德同罗克一起度过了三天三夜。不过，即使他同罗克一起度过三百年，罗克的生活也总是那么变化无穷：早晨还在这儿，吃饭时就跑到别处去了；有时不知要躲避什么人，有时又不知在等待什么人。他们睡觉时都站着，睡到一半又转移地方。他们所做的就是站岗放哨，吹旺火枪的引火绳，尽管他们并没有几只火枪，大部分人只是用燧石枪。罗克不同他的部下一同过夜，总是独处一地，谁也不准打听他在哪儿。巴塞罗那总督已经发布了很多布告，悬赏捉拿他，因此罗克总是忐忑不安，心惊胆战，怕他的部下把他杀了或者把他送交官府。他这种生活真是可怜而又可悲。\n 罗克、唐吉诃德、桑乔和另外六个随从沿着荒凉的小路，一路披荆斩棘地赶赴巴塞罗那，在圣约翰日前夜来到了巴塞罗那的海滩。罗克拥抱了唐吉诃德和桑乔，把前面曾许给桑乔的十个盾交给了桑乔。几个人客气一番，罗克便告别了。\n 罗克走了以后，唐吉诃德仍留在原地，骑在马上等待天明。东方很快就露出了晨曦，乳白色的晨光为绿草鲜花带来了愉悦。人们可以听到笛声、鼓声和铃销声，以及从城里来的脚夫“让一下！让一下！”的吆喝声。晨曦又迎来了太阳。\n 太阳就像一块大护胸盾，从地平线冉冉升起。\n 唐吉诃德和桑乔放眼向四方望去，看到了他们从未见过的大海。大海浩瀚无垠，比他们在曼查看到的鲁伊德拉湖大得多了。他们还看到，停泊于海岸的几艘船已经降下了船篷。船上无数彩带和三角旗迎风飘动，还不时地垂掠水面。船上鼓号齐鸣，悠扬而又雄壮的音调远近可闻。那几艘船摆开战斗的阵势，开始在平静的水面上缓缓移动。地面上与之呼应的是无数身着艳丽服装的骑手，骑着英俊的马匹从城内奔出。船上的士兵连连射击，城墙上和堡垒里的士兵放炮回敬，炮声隆隆，划破了天空。船上的士兵也不甘示弱，开炮作答。大海起舞，大地欢腾，空气清新，只有炮火的烟雾偶尔混浊了晴空。此情此景仿佛让所有人都感到了一种从未有过的兴致。只有桑乔无论如何也想象不出，为什么那些在海上移动的庞然大物竟有那么多只脚①。\n ①指船桨。\n 那些高喊着“雷里里”的骑马人已经冲到了唐吉诃德面前，把唐吉诃德吓得不知所措。其中一个骑马人就是罗克通知的那个人。他对唐吉诃德说道：\n “欢迎您到我们城市来，游侠骑士的楷模、明灯和北斗星，还有您的其他数不尽的英名。欢迎您，曼查的英勇的唐吉诃德，我说的不是我们最近看到的那部伪作里的假唐吉诃德，而是史学家精英锡德·哈迈德·贝嫩赫利描述的那个真正的唐吉诃德。”\n 唐吉诃德并不答话。那几个骑马人也不等他答话，便同一起来的那些人围着唐吉诃德绕起圈来。唐吉诃德转身对桑乔说道：\n “他们认识我。我敢打赌，他们一定读过写咱们的书，连刚刚出版的阿拉贡人写的那本也读过。”\n 刚才同唐吉诃德说话的那个骑马人又转回来对唐吉诃德说道：\n “请您跟我们走吧，唐吉诃德大人。我们是罗克·吉纳德的老朋友，都是您的仆人。”\n 唐吉诃德答道：\n “如果礼貌能够带动礼貌，那么骑士大人，您的盛情源于伟大的罗克对我的盛情。您随意带我到任何地方去吧，我愿意尊崇您的意志，而且只要您乐意，我愿意为您效劳。”\n 那位骑马人也同样客套了一番。然后，那些人簇拥着唐吉诃德，随着鼓乐的伴奏，一起走向城里。他们刚进城，就有两个坏得不能再坏的顽童挤进了人群里，一个掀起灰驴的尾巴，另一个掀起罗西南多的尾巴，把两束棘豆分别插进两头牲口的屁股。两头牲口感到疼痛，可是越夹尾巴越难受，便尥起蹶子来，把两个主人摔到了地上。唐吉诃德又羞又气，赶紧把插进马屁股的东西拔了出来，桑乔也把驴屁股里的东西扯了出来。伴随唐吉诃德的那些人想惩罚那两个顽童，可是已经不可能了，两个孩子早已混进了数以千计的人群之中。\n 唐吉诃德和桑乔又骑上牲口，仍然在鼓乐声的伴奏下来到了那个引路的骑马人的家。那是个高门大宅，看样子是个富裕人家。这些咱们暂且不提吧，因为这是锡德·哈迈德的意思。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4682.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
