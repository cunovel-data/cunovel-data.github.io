{"id":42244,"no":104,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 50","content":"Wherein is Set Forth who the Enchanters and Executioners Were Who Flogged the Duenna and Pinched Don Quixote, and Also what Befell the Page who Carried the Letter to Teresa Panza, Sancho Panza’s Wife\\n\\n Now the history says this page was very sharp and quick-witted; and eager to serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for Sancho’s village. Before he entered it he observed a number of women washing in a brook, and asked them if they could tell him whether there lived there a woman of the name of Teresa Panza, wife of one Sancho Panza, squire to a knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha. At the question a young girl who was washing stood up and said, “Teresa Panza is my mother, and that Sancho is my father, and that knight is our master.”\\n\\n “Well then, miss,” said the page, “come and show me where your mother is, for I bring her a letter and a present from your father.”\\n\\n “That I will with all my heart, senor,” said the girl, who seemed to be about fourteen, more or less; and leaving the clothes she was washing to one of her companions, and without putting anything on her head or feet, for she was bare-legged and had her hair hanging about her, away she skipped in front of the page’s horse, saying, “Come, your worship, our house is at the entrance of the town, and my mother is there, sorrowful enough at not having had any news of my father this ever so long.”\\n\\n “Well,” said the page, “I am bringing her such good news that she will have reason to thank God.”\\n\\n And then, skipping, running, and capering, the girl reached the town, but before going into the house she called out at the door, “Come out, mother Teresa, come out, come out; here’s a gentleman with letters and other things from my good father.” At these words her mother Teresa Panza came out spinning a bundle of flax, in a grey petticoat (so short was it one would have fancied “they to her shame had cut it short”), a grey bodice of the same stuff, and a smock. She was not very old, though plainly past forty, strong, healthy, vigorous, and sun-dried; and seeing her daughter and the page on horseback, she exclaimed, “What’s this, child? What gentleman is this?”\\n\\n “A servant of my lady, Dona Teresa Panza,” replied the page; and suiting the action to the word he flung himself off his horse, and with great humility advanced to kneel before the lady Teresa, saying, “Let me kiss your hand, Senora Dona Teresa, as the lawful and only wife of Senor Don Sancho Panza, rightful governor of the island of Barataria.”\\n\\n “Ah, senor, get up, do that,” said Teresa; “for I’m not a bit of a court lady, but only a poor country woman, the daughter of a clodcrusher, and the wife of a squire-errant and not of any governor at all.”\\n\\n “You are,” said the page, “the most worthy wife of a most arch-worthy governor; and as a proof of what I say accept this letter and this present;” and at the same time he took out of his pocket a string of coral beads with gold clasps, and placed it on her neck, and said, “This letter is from his lordship the governor, and the other as well as these coral beads from my lady the duchess, who sends me to your worship.”\\n\\n Teresa stood lost in astonishment, and her daughter just as much, and the girl said, “May I die but our master Don Quixote’s at the bottom of this; he must have given father the government or county he so often promised him.”\\n\\n “That is the truth,” said the page; “for it is through Senor Don Quixote that Senor Sancho is now governor of the island of Barataria, as will be seen by this letter.”\\n\\n “Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?” said Teresa; “for though I can spin I can’t read, not a scrap.”\\n\\n “Nor I either,” said Sanchica; “but wait a bit, and I’ll go and fetch some one who can read it, either the curate himself or the bachelor Samson Carrasco, and they’ll come gladly to hear any news of my father.”\\n\\n “There is no need to fetch anybody,” said the page; “for though I can’t spin I can read, and I’ll read it;” and so he read it through, but as it has been already given it is not inserted here; and then he took out the other one from the duchess, which ran as follows:\\n\\n Friend Teresa, — Your husband Sancho’s good qualities, of heart as well as of head, induced and compelled me to request my husband the duke to give him the government of one of his many islands. I am told he governs like a gerfalcon, of which I am very glad, and my lord the duke, of course, also; and I am very thankful to heaven that I have not made a mistake in choosing him for that same government; for I would have Senora Teresa know that a good governor is hard to find in this world and may God make me as good as Sancho’s way of governing. Herewith I send you, my dear, a string of coral beads with gold clasps; I wish they were Oriental pearls; but “he who gives thee a bone does not wish to see thee dead;” a time will come when we shall become acquainted and meet one another, but God knows the future. Commend me to your daughter Sanchica, and tell her from me to hold herself in readiness, for I mean to make a high match for her when she least expects it. They tell me there are big acorns in your village; send me a couple of dozen or so, and I shall value them greatly as coming from your hand; and write to me at length to assure me of your health and well-being; and if there be anything you stand in need of, it is but to open your mouth, and that shall be the measure; and so God keep you.\\n\\n From this place. Your loving friend, The DUCHESS.\\n\\n “Ah, what a good, plain, lowly lady!” said Teresa when she heard the letter; “that I may be buried with ladies of that sort, and not the gentlewomen we have in this town, that fancy because they are gentlewomen the wind must not touch them, and go to church with as much airs as if they were queens, no less, and seem to think they are disgraced if they look at a farmer’s wife! And see here how this good lady, for all she’s a duchess, calls me ‘friend,’ and treats me as if I was her equal — and equal may I see her with the tallest church-tower in La Mancha! And as for the acorns, senor, I’ll send her ladyship a peck and such big ones that one might come to see them as a show and a wonder. And now, Sanchica, see that the gentleman is comfortable; put up his horse, and get some eggs out of the stable, and cut plenty of bacon, and let’s give him his dinner like a prince; for the good news he has brought, and his own bonny face deserve it all; and meanwhile I’ll run out and give the neighbours the news of our good luck, and father curate, and Master Nicholas the barber, who are and always have been such friends of thy father’s .”\\n\\n “That I will, mother,” said Sanchica; “but mind, you must give me half of that string; for I don’t think my lady the duchess could have been so stupid as to send it all to you.”\\n\\n “It is all for thee, my child,” said Teresa; “but let me wear it round my neck for a few days; for verily it seems to make my heart glad.”\\n\\n “You will be glad too,” said the page, “when you see the bundle there is in this portmanteau, for it is a suit of the finest cloth, that the governor only wore one day out hunting and now sends, all for Senora Sanchica.”\\n\\n “May he live a thousand years,” said Sanchica, “and the bearer as many, nay two thousand, if needful.”\\n\\n With this Teresa hurried out of the house with the letters, and with the string of beads round her neck, and went along thrumming the letters as if they were a tambourine, and by chance coming across the curate and Samson Carrasco she began capering and saying, “None of us poor now, faith! We’ve got a little government! Ay, let the finest fine lady tackle me, and I’ll give her a setting down!”\\n\\n “What’s all this, Teresa Panza,” said they; “what madness is this, and what papers are those?”\\n\\n “The madness is only this,” said she, “that these are the letters of duchesses and governors, and these I have on my neck are fine coral beads, with ave-marias and paternosters of beaten gold, and I am a governess.”\\n\\n “God help us,” said the curate, “we don’t understand you, Teresa, or know what you are talking about.”\\n\\n “There, you may see it yourselves,” said Teresa, and she handed them the letters.\\n\\n The curate read them out for Samson Carrasco to hear, and Samson and he regarded one another with looks of astonishment at what they had read, and the bachelor asked who had brought the letters. Teresa in reply bade them come with her to her house and they would see the messenger, a most elegant youth, who had brought another present which was worth as much more. The curate took the coral beads from her neck and examined them again and again, and having satisfied himself as to their fineness he fell to wondering afresh, and said, “By the gown I wear I don’t know what to say or think of these letters and presents; on the one hand I can see and feel the fineness of these coral beads, and on the other I read how a duchess sends to beg for a couple of dozen of acorns.”\\n\\n “Square that if you can,” said Carrasco; “well, let’s go and see the messenger, and from him we’ll learn something about this mystery that has turned up.”\\n\\n They did so, and Teresa returned with them. They found the page sifting a little barley for his horse, and Sanchica cutting a rasher of bacon to be paved with eggs for his dinner. His looks and his handsome apparel pleased them both greatly; and after they had saluted him courteously, and he them, Samson begged him to give them his news, as well of Don Quixote as of Sancho Panza, for, he said, though they had read the letters from Sancho and her ladyship the duchess, they were still puzzled and could not make out what was meant by Sancho’s government, and above all of an island, when all or most of those in the Mediterranean belonged to his Majesty.\\n\\n To this the page replied, “As to Senor Sancho Panza’s being a governor there is no doubt whatever; but whether it is an island or not that he governs, with that I have nothing to do; suffice it that it is a town of more than a thousand inhabitants; with regard to the acorns I may tell you my lady the duchess is so unpretending and unassuming that, not to speak of sending to beg for acorns from a peasant woman, she has been known to send to ask for the loan of a comb from one of her neighbours; for I would have your worships know that the ladies of Aragon, though they are just as illustrious, are not so punctilious and haughty as the Castilian ladies; they treat people with greater familiarity.”\\n\\n In the middle of this conversation Sanchica came in with her skirt full of eggs, and said she to the page, “Tell me, senor, does my father wear trunk-hose since he has been governor?”\\n\\n “I have not noticed,” said the page; “but no doubt he wears them.”\\n\\n “Ah! my God!” said Sanchica, “what a sight it must be to see my father in tights! Isn’t it odd that ever since I was born I have had a longing to see my father in trunk-hose?”\\n\\n “As things go you will see that if you live,” said the page; “by God he is in the way to take the road with a sunshade if the government only lasts him two months more.”\\n\\n The curate and the bachelor could see plainly enough that the page spoke in a waggish vein; but the fineness of the coral beads, and the hunting suit that Sancho sent (for Teresa had already shown it to them) did away with the impression; and they could not help laughing at Sanchica’s wish, and still more when Teresa said, “Senor curate, look about if there’s anybody here going to Madrid or Toledo, to buy me a hooped petticoat, a proper fashionable one of the best quality; for indeed and indeed I must do honour to my husband’s government as well as I can; nay, if I am put to it and have to, I’ll go to Court and set a coach like all the world; for she who has a governor for her husband may very well have one and keep one.”\\n\\n “And why not, mother!” said Sanchica; “would to God it were to-day instead of to-morrow, even though they were to say when they saw me seated in the coach with my mother, ‘See that rubbish, that garlic-stuffed fellow’s daughter, how she goes stretched at her ease in a coach as if she was a she-pope!’ But let them tramp through the mud, and let me go in my coach with my feet off the ground. Bad luck to backbiters all over the world; ‘let me go warm and the people may laugh.’ Do I say right, mother?”\\n\\n “To be sure you do, my child,” said Teresa; “and all this good luck, and even more, my good Sancho foretold me; and thou wilt see, my daughter, he won’t stop till he has made me a countess; for to make a beginning is everything in luck; and as I have heard thy good father say many a time (for besides being thy father he’s the father of proverbs too), ‘When they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; when they offer thee a government, take it; when they would give thee a county, seize it; when they say, “Here, here!” to thee with something good, swallow it.’ Oh no! go to sleep, and don’t answer the strokes of good fortune and the lucky chances that are knocking at the door of your house!”\\n\\n “And what do I care,” added Sanchica, “whether anybody says when he sees me holding my head up, ‘The dog saw himself in hempen breeches,’ and the rest of it?”\\n\\n Hearing this the curate said, “I do believe that all this family of the Panzas are born with a sackful of proverbs in their insides, every one of them; I never saw one of them that does not pour them out at all times and on all occasions.”\\n\\n “That is true,” said the page, “for Senor Governor Sancho utters them at every turn; and though a great many of them are not to the purpose, still they amuse one, and my lady the duchess and the duke praise them highly.”\\n\\n “Then you still maintain that all this about Sancho’s government is true, senor,” said the bachelor, “and that there actually is a duchess who sends him presents and writes to him? Because we, although we have handled the present and read the letters, don’t believe it and suspect it to be something in the line of our fellow-townsman Don Quixote, who fancies that everything is done by enchantment; and for this reason I am almost ready to say that I’d like to touch and feel your worship to see whether you are a mere ambassador of the imagination or a man of flesh and blood.”\\n\\n “All I know, sirs,” replied the page, “is that I am a real ambassador, and that Senor Sancho Panza is governor as a matter of fact, and that my lord and lady the duke and duchess can give, and have given him this same government, and that I have heard the said Sancho Panza bears himself very stoutly therein; whether there be any enchantment in all this or not, it is for your worships to settle between you; for that’s all I know by the oath I swear, and that is by the life of my parents whom I have still alive, and love dearly.”\\n\\n “It may be so,” said the bachelor; “but dubitat Augustinus.”\\n\\n “Doubt who will,” said the page; “what I have told you is the truth, and that will always rise above falsehood as oil above water; if not operibus credite, et non verbis. Let one of you come with me, and he will see with his eyes what he does not believe with his ears.”\\n\\n “It’s for me to make that trip,” said Sanchica; “take me with you, senor, behind you on your horse; for I’ll go with all my heart to see my father.”\\n\\n “Governors’ daughters,” said the page, “must not travel along the roads alone, but accompanied by coaches and litters and a great number of attendants.”\\n\\n “By God,” said Sanchica, “I can go just as well mounted on a she-ass as in a coach; what a dainty lass you must take me for!”\\n\\n “Hush, girl,” said Teresa; “you don’t know what you’re talking about; the gentleman is quite right, for ‘as the time so the behaviour;’ when it was Sancho it was ‘Sancha;’ when it is governor it’s ‘senora;’ I don’t know if I’m right.”\\n\\n “Senora Teresa says more than she is aware of,” said the page; “and now give me something to eat and let me go at once, for I mean to return this evening.”\\n\\n “Come and do penance with me,” said the curate at this; “for Senora Teresa has more will than means to serve so worthy a guest.”\\n\\n The page refused, but had to consent at last for his own sake; and the curate took him home with him very gladly, in order to have an opportunity of questioning him at leisure about Don Quixote and his doings. The bachelor offered to write the letters in reply for Teresa; but she did not care to let him mix himself up in her affairs, for she thought him somewhat given to joking; and so she gave a cake and a couple of eggs to a young acolyte who was a penman, and he wrote for her two letters, one for her husband and the other for the duchess, dictated out of her own head, which are not the worst inserted in this great history, as will be seen farther on.\\n\\n \\n\\n 谁，侍童给桑乔的老婆特雷沙·潘萨送信\\n\\n 锡德·哈迈德这部书中描写的每个细节都准确无误。他说，唐娜罗德里格斯走出自己的房间到唐吉诃德那儿去的时候，被另一个与她同居一室的女佣发觉了。所有的女佣都喜欢打听、了解和刺探别人的情况。她悄悄跟在唐娜罗德里格斯后面，而唐娜罗德里格斯对此却一无所知。那个女佣见唐娜罗德里格斯进了唐吉诃德的房间，马上也像其他爱搬弄是非的女佣一样，把这件事报告给公爵夫人，说唐娜罗德里格斯正在唐吉诃德的房间里。\\n\\n 公爵夫人又把这件事告诉了公爵，并请求公爵允许她和阿尔蒂西多拉一起去看看，到底唐娜罗德里格斯在唐吉诃德那儿干什么。公爵同意了，于是两人一步步摸索着，悄悄来到唐吉诃德房间的门前。因为离得近，所以里面说的话都能听到。公爵夫人听到唐娜罗德里格斯把她腿上有排泄口的事情抖搂了出来，怒不可遏，阿尔蒂西多拉也气坏了。两人满腔怒火，非要教训唐娜罗德里格斯不可，于是猛然冲进去，就像前面说到的，把唐吉诃德掐了一遍，又把唐娜罗德里格斯抽打了一顿。有损女人美丽形象的攻击最令女人恼火，她们总得设法报复了才罢。公爵夫人把发生的事情告诉了公爵，公爵听了觉得很有趣。公爵夫人也想把玩笑继续开下去，拿唐吉诃德解闷，就派了那个曾经装扮成中了魔法的杜尔西内亚的侍童，把桑乔给他老婆特雷莎·潘萨的信和自己的一封信送去，还送了一大串珊瑚珠作为礼物。此时的桑乔正忙着当总督，早把为杜尔西内亚解除魔法的事扔到脑后去了。\\n\\n 据说那个侍童很聪明，很愿意为自己的主子效劳，于是他高高兴兴地到桑乔家去了。还没进村，侍童就看见有些女人在小溪边洗衣服，于是侍童问她们，那地方是否有个叫特雷莎·潘萨的女人，她的丈夫桑乔·潘萨是曼查一个叫唐吉诃德的骑士的侍从。一个正在洗衣服的女孩站起来说道：\\n\\n “特雷莎·潘萨是我母亲，桑乔是我父亲，那个骑士是我们的主人。”\\n\\n “那么你过来，小姑娘，”侍童说，“带我去见你母亲吧。\\n\\n 我给她带来了你父亲的一封信和一件礼物。”\\n\\n “我很愿意带您去，大人。”小女孩说道。看上去她十四岁左右。她把自己洗的衣服交给一个同伴，没戴头巾，也没穿袜子，就卷着裤腿，披散着头发，跳到侍童的马前说道：\\n\\n “请您跟我来吧。我家就在村口，我母亲也在家，已经好多天没听到父亲的消息了，她正着急呢。”\\n\\n “那么我给她带来了好消息，”侍童说，“这可得感谢上帝。”\\n\\n 小姑娘蹦蹦跳跳地来到村头，还没进屋就喊道：\\n\\n “快出来，妈妈！快出来，出来呀！”\\n\\n 随着喊声，女孩的母亲特雷莎·潘萨出来了，手里还在绕着一团麻绳。她穿着一条棕褐色裙子，裙子短到仅够遮羞的部位；上身的紧身背心和衬衫也都是棕褐色的。人看样子倒不很老，不过也四十多岁了。然而，她的身体很健壮，皮肤也晒成了褐色。她一见女儿和骑在马上的侍童，便问道：\\n\\n “怎么回事，孩子？这位大人是谁？”\\n\\n “是唐娜特雷莎·潘萨夫人您的仆人。”侍童答道。\\n\\n 侍童说完就下了马，毕恭毕敬地跪倒在特雷莎夫人面前，说道：\\n\\n “唐娜特雷莎夫人，您是巴拉托里亚岛总督桑乔·潘萨的结发妻子，请您把手伸给我吧。”\\n\\n “我的天啊，滚一边儿去，别跟我来这套！”特雷莎说，“我又不是什么宫廷夫人，只是个贫苦农妇，是个短工的女儿，是个游侠骑士侍从而不是什么总督的老婆！”\\n\\n “您就是最尊贵的总督的最尊贵夫人，”侍童说，“为了证明我说的是真的，请您接受这封信和这份礼物。”\\n\\n 接着，侍童从衣袋里拿出一串珊瑚珠，两端是两颗金珠，把它挂到了特雷莎的脖子上，并且说道：\\n\\n “这儿还有总督大人的一封信。另一封信和珊瑚珠是我的女主人公爵夫人派我给您送来的。”\\n\\n 特雷莎和她的女儿都惊呆了。小姑娘说道：\\n\\n “我拿性命担保，这准是我们的主人唐吉诃德干的。他多次答应要让父亲当总督或伯爵，大概现在已经让父亲当上了。”\\n\\n “是的，”侍童说，“靠着唐吉诃德大人的面子，桑乔大人现在已经是巴拉托里亚岛的总督了。你们看看信就知道了。”\\n\\n “请您给我念念吧，侍臣。”特雷莎说，“我只会纺线，不识字。”\\n\\n “我也不识字。”桑奇卡也说，“不过你们等等，我去找个人来念念，找牧师，或者参孙·卡拉斯科学士。他们也愿意知道我父亲的消息，肯定会来。”\\n\\n “没必要去找人念。我不会纺线，可是识字。”\\n\\n 侍童把信念了一遍。信的内容前面已经提到，此处就不赘述了。侍童又掏出了公爵夫人的信，信是这样写的：\\n\\n 特雷莎朋友，您的善良聪明的丈夫桑乔的优秀品质感动了我，迫使我请求我的丈夫公爵给他一个岛屿，让他当总督，我丈夫有很多岛屿。听说他把岛屿管理得很不错，我为此感到高兴，我丈夫也同样高兴。我非常感谢老天没让我选错人。我想告诉特雷莎夫人，要在世界上找到一个好总督很困难。感谢上帝让我找到了桑乔这样的人当总督。\\n\\n 亲爱的朋友，我派人给您送去一串两端是金珠的珊瑚珠子。我很愿意送您这东方明珠，礼轻情义重。咱们也许会有机会认识交流，谁知道以后会怎么样呢。代问您女儿桑奇卡好，告诉她也许在她意想不到的时候，我会让她嫁到高贵人家去。\\n\\n 听说你们那儿的橡子特别大，请给我带几十个来。因为是来自您的手，我会特别珍重它们的。请给我多多写信，告诉我您的身体状况。有什么事需要我帮忙的，尽管开口，您的要求一定会得到满足。愿上帝保佑您。\\n\\n 您的好朋友\\n\\n 公爵夫人于本地\\n\\n “哎呀，多么善良、多么平易近人、多么谦虚的夫人啊。”信刚一念完，特雷莎就说道，“我愿意永远和这样的夫人在一起。我讨厌我们村的那些贵夫人，她们谁也不理，把自己想得跟女王一样高贵，觉得看农妇一眼就有失她们的身份。你们看这位夫人，虽然是公爵夫人，却称我为朋友，对我平等相待，可我觉得她像曼查的钟楼一样高。至于橡子，侍臣，我要送给夫人一塞雷敏①，若论个儿，颗颗都大得出奇。桑奇卡，现在你先照顾一下这位侍臣，把他的马安顿好，再从马厩拿几个鸡蛋来，切一大块腌猪肉，让咱们好好犒劳犒劳他吧。就冲他带来的好消息和他那张漂亮的脸蛋，真该好好款待他。我先去把咱们的好消息告诉邻居，告诉神甫，告诉理发的尼古拉斯师傅，他们都是你父亲的好朋友嘛。”\\n\\n ①容量单位，一塞雷敏相当于4．625公升。\\n\\n “我就去，妈妈，”桑奇卡说，“可是您得把那串珊瑚珠分给我一半儿。我觉得公爵夫人不会那么笨，把一串珊瑚珠都送给你一个人。”\\n\\n “这串珠子全是你的，”特雷莎说，“不过你先让我戴几天，我从心里特别喜欢它。”\\n\\n “这个口袋里的衣服你们也一定喜欢，”侍童说，“全是细料子衣服，总督只是在打猎时穿过一天。这些都是送给桑奇卡的。”\\n\\n “爸爸千岁！”桑奇卡说，“把衣服送来的人也千岁！如果需要的话，还可以两千岁！”\\n\\n 特雷莎手里拿着信，脖子上挂着珊瑚珠出了家门，边走边像敲手鼓似的拍着信。正巧她碰到了神甫和参孙·卡拉斯科，便手舞足蹈地说起来：\\n\\n “现在我们家可不算穷人了！我们家出了个总督！无论哪个贵族夫人，无论她有多神气，我都不把她放在眼里！”\\n\\n “怎么回事，特雷莎·潘萨？你抽什么疯？那几张纸是什么？”\\n\\n “我没抽疯。这是公爵夫人和总督的来信。我脖子上戴的是用高级珊瑚做的念珠，两头的珠子是真金的。我是总督夫人！”\\n\\n “除了上帝，我们谁也听不懂你的话，不知道你在说什么。”\\n\\n “那你们看看这个。”特雷莎说。\\n\\n 她把信交给神甫和参孙·卡拉斯科。神甫把信念了一遍，参孙·卡拉斯科在旁边听着，结果两人面面相觑，对信上的内容感到很吃惊。卡拉斯科问是谁把信送来的，特雷莎让他们随自己去她家，就可以见到送信人了。那是个仪表堂堂的小伙子。他还带来了一件贵重的礼物。神甫把她脖子上的珊瑚珠拿下来看了看，确实挺高级的，这就更奇怪了。神甫说：\\n\\n “我凭我身上的法衣发誓，我不明白也想不出这两封信和这件礼物到底是怎么回事。凭我眼看手摸，这串珊瑚珠的确很精致，可是写信的公爵夫人怎么会只要几十个橡子呢？”\\n\\n “别瞎猜了！”卡拉斯科这时候说道，“咱们还是去看看带信来的那个人吧。咱们搞不清楚的事情可以让他告诉咱们。”\\n\\n 于是他们来到特雷莎家。侍童正在筛大麦准备喂他的马；桑奇卡正在切肉，准备再摊上几个鸡蛋，做给侍童吃。侍童的外貌和服饰使神甫和参孙产生了一种好感。他们非常客气地互致问候后，参孙请侍童谈谈唐吉诃德和桑乔的情况，说他和神甫虽然看了桑乔和公爵夫人的信，但还是没弄清桑乔当总督到底是怎么回事，因为地中海里的全部或者大部分岛屿都是国王的。侍童答道：\\n\\n “桑乔·潘萨当了总督，这点没错；至于当的是不是岛屿的总督，我可没打听，只知道那是一个有一千多人的地方。说到要橡子的事，那得说我们公爵夫人平易近人，不摆架子（侍童没说公爵夫人不仅向农妇讨橡子，而且还向一位女街坊借过梳子呢）。我想你们应该知道，阿拉贡的贵夫人虽然身份高贵，却不像卡斯蒂利亚的贵夫人那样摆臭架子，而是同平民百姓很接近。”\\n\\n 他们正说着，桑奇卡兜着几个鸡蛋蹦蹦跳跳地跑进来问侍童：\\n\\n “请您告诉我，我父亲当了总督以后还穿连袜裤①吗？”\\n\\n “我没看见，”侍童说，“大概穿吧。”\\n\\n “啊，我的上帝呀，”桑奇卡说，“我父亲穿连袜裤会是什么样子呀！我从小就喜欢看他穿连袜裤，这难道不好吗？”\\n\\n “以后你都会看到，”侍童说，“我向上帝发誓，只要你父亲当上两个月的总督，出门就还得戴套头棉帽呢②。”\\n\\n ①侍从穿的一种裤子。\\n\\n ②贵人戴的帽子，既防冷又防土。\\n\\n 神甫和学士看出侍童说话时明显带着一种嘲弄的口吻。可是侍童确实带来了精美的珊瑚珠，特雷莎还让他们看了桑乔送来的猎服，这又打消了两人的疑虑。听了桑奇卡的愿望，他们不由得笑起来，特雷莎更是让他们乐得嘴都合不上了。特雷莎说：\\n\\n “神甫大人，请您留意一下是否有人到马德里或托莱多去，让他给我带一条地地道道的带裙撑的裙子，而且要最好的，最时髦的。我怎么也得给我当总督的丈夫争点面子。就是我不愿意，我也得像其他夫人那样，坐着马车去京城呢。丈夫当了总督，当然坐得起马车了。”\\n\\n “可不是嘛，妈妈！”桑奇卡说，“求上帝保佑，让我们早早坐上车，别人看见我坐在车上准会说：‘你们看那个丫头，满身蒜味，还像个女皇似的出门乘马车呢。’让他们去踩烂泥吧，我可得乘车，不让脚沾地。这年头哪儿都有人嘀嘀咕咕的。随便他们怎么说吧，反正我舒服了。我说得对吗，妈妈？”\\n\\n “你说得太对了，孩子！”特雷莎说，“我的好桑乔早就告诉我会有这些好事，而且以后还会有更大的好事呢。你看着吧，孩子，我早晚得当上伯爵夫人。咱们这才是个开头。我常听你那好爸爸说，噢，他不仅是你的好爸爸，也是俗语的好爸爸。他说，人家给你牛，你就赶紧拿绳牵走；让你当总督，你就当；让你当伯爵，你就别客气；若是送你一件令人啧啧称羡的礼物，你就赶紧揣起来。你只管睡你的觉，好事自然会来敲你的门，你都不用吭气！”\\n\\n “有人看见我生活得好，得意洋洋，”桑奇卡说，“就说什么‘狗穿上麻裤①’之类，我才不在乎呢！”\\n\\n ①全句应为“狗穿上麻裤，就不认识同伴了”。\\n\\n 神甫闻言说道：\\n\\n “我相信桑乔家族的人都是天生满肚子俗语。无论什么时候，一张嘴就是俗语。”\\n\\n “是的，”侍童说，“桑乔总督一张嘴就是俗语。虽然常常用得并不合适，却挺有意思的，我的女主人公爵夫人和公爵都很赞赏。”\\n\\n “大人，”学士说，“您仍然坚持说桑乔当总督的事是真的，而且真有公爵夫人写信送礼物来吗？虽然我们摸过了礼物，也看过了信，可我们还是不能相信这些事，总觉得这属于我们的老乡唐吉诃德遇到的那种事。他认为他遇到的那些事都是受魔法操纵的。所以，我现在只差说我该摸摸您了，看看您究竟是一位魔幻使者还是一个有血有肉的人？”\\n\\n “诸位大人，”侍童说，“我只知道我是个地地道道的使者。还有，桑乔·潘萨确实当了总督，是我的主人公爵和公爵夫人让他当的总督。我还听说这个桑乔·潘萨当总督当得很有魄力。至于这里面是否有魔法，你们自己去争论吧。我只能发誓担保我说的是真的。我以我父母的生命发誓。我的父母都还健在，我非常爱他们。”\\n\\n “事情可能确实如此，”学士说，“不过谁都有权利怀疑。”\\n\\n “谁愿意怀疑就怀疑去吧，”侍童说，“反正事实我已经说过了。假话总是靠不住的，早晚得露馅。‘你们纵然不信我，也应当信这些事①。’你们可以选哪一位跟我回去，既然耳听为虚，那就眼见为实吧。”\\n\\n ①此处是引用《圣经》里的一句话。\\n\\n “那就让我去吧，”桑奇卡说，“您让我坐在您的马屁股上，我很想去看看我父亲。”\\n\\n “总督的女儿不能独来独往，得有大批车轿和侍者相随。”\\n\\n “我向上帝发誓，”桑奇卡说，“我也可以骑一头母驴去。\\n\\n 这也跟乘车一样，您别以为我太娇气了。”\\n\\n “住嘴，孩子！”特雷莎说，“你没听明白，这位大人说得对。什么时候得说什么话。他是桑乔，我就是桑查；他是总督，我就是总督夫人。不知我说得对不对。”\\n\\n “特雷莎夫人说得言简意深。”侍童说，“给我点吃的吧，帮我准备一下，我想今天下午回去。”\\n\\n 神甫说：\\n\\n “请您到我那儿吃顿便饭吧。招待您这样的贵客，特雷莎夫人恐怕有此心无此力。”\\n\\n 侍童不想去，不过后来他还是接受了神甫的好意。神甫很愿意让侍童到自己家来，这样就可以仔细打听唐吉诃德和他的所作所为了。\\n\\n 学士自告奋勇替特雷莎写回信，可特雷莎不愿意让学士插手，她觉得学士办事总不太可靠。于是，她拿了一个小面包和两个鸡蛋去找一个会写字的少年。少年替她写了两封信，一封给她丈夫，一封给公爵夫人。从这两封信里可以看出，特雷莎的才智在本书里不算是最差的。请看下文。\\n\\n \\n\\n
