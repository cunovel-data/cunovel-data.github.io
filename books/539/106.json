{"id":42246,"no":106,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 52","content":"Cide Hamete relates that Don Quixote being now cured of his scratches felt that the life he was leading in the castle was entirely inconsistent with the order of chivalry he professed, so he determined to ask the duke and duchess to permit him to take his departure for Saragossa, as the time of the festival was now drawing near, and he hoped to win there the suit of armour which is the prize at festivals of the sort. But one day at table with the duke and duchess, just as he was about to carry his resolution into effect and ask for their permission, lo and behold suddenly there came in through the door of the great hall two women, as they afterwards proved to be, draped in mourning from head to foot, one of whom approaching Don Quixote flung herself at full length at his feet, pressing her lips to them, and uttering moans so sad, so deep, and so doleful that she put all who heard and saw her into a state of perplexity; and though the duke and duchess supposed it must be some joke their servants were playing off upon Don Quixote, still the earnest way the woman sighed and moaned and wept puzzled them and made them feel uncertain, until Don Quixote, touched with compassion, raised her up and made her unveil herself and remove the mantle from her tearful face. She complied and disclosed what no one could have ever anticipated, for she disclosed the countenance of Dona Rodriguez, the duenna of the house; the other female in mourning being her daughter, who had been made a fool of by the rich farmer’s son. All who knew her were filled with astonishment, and the duke and duchess more than any; for though they thought her a simpleton and a weak creature, they did not think her capable of crazy pranks. Dona Rodriguez, at length, turning to her master and mistress said to them, “Will your excellences be pleased to permit me to speak to this gentleman for a moment, for it is requisite I should do so in order to get successfully out of the business in which the boldness of an evil-minded clown has involved me?”\\n\\n The duke said that for his part he gave her leave, and that she might speak with Senor Don Quixote as much as she liked.\\n\\n She then, turning to Don Quixote and addressing herself to him said, “Some days since, valiant knight, I gave you an account of the injustice and treachery of a wicked farmer to my dearly beloved daughter, the unhappy damsel here before you, and you promised me to take her part and right the wrong that has been done her; but now it has come to my hearing that you are about to depart from this castle in quest of such fair adventures as God may vouchsafe to you; therefore, before you take the road, I would that you challenge this froward rustic, and compel him to marry my daughter in fulfillment of the promise he gave her to become her husband before he seduced her; for to expect that my lord the duke will do me justice is to ask pears from the elm tree, for the reason I stated privately to your worship; and so may our Lord grant you good health and forsake us not.”\\n\\n To these words Don Quixote replied very gravely and solemnly, “Worthy duenna, check your tears, or rather dry them, and spare your sighs, for I take it upon myself to obtain redress for your daughter, for whom it would have been better not to have been so ready to believe lovers’ promises, which are for the most part quickly made and very slowly performed; and so, with my lord the duke’s leave, I will at once go in quest of this inhuman youth, and will find him out and challenge him and slay him, if so be he refuses to keep his promised word; for the chief object of my profession is to spare the humble and chastise the proud; I mean, to help the distressed and destroy the oppressors.”\\n\\n “There is no necessity,” said the duke, “for your worship to take the trouble of seeking out the rustic of whom this worthy duenna complains, nor is there any necessity, either, for asking my leave to challenge him; for I admit him duly challenged, and will take care that he is informed of the challenge, and accepts it, and comes to answer it in person to this castle of mine, where I shall afford to both a fair field, observing all the conditions which are usually and properly observed in such trials, and observing too justice to both sides, as all princes who offer a free field to combatants within the limits of their lordships are bound to do.”\\n\\n “Then with that assurance and your highness’s good leave,” said Don Quixote, “I hereby for this once waive my privilege of gentle blood, and come down and put myself on a level with the lowly birth of the wrong-doer, making myself equal with him and enabling him to enter into combat with me; and so, I challenge and defy him, though absent, on the plea of his malfeasance in breaking faith with this poor damsel, who was a maiden and now by his misdeed is none; and say that he shall fulfill the promise he gave her to become her lawful husband, or else stake his life upon the question.”\\n\\n And then plucking off a glove he threw it down in the middle of the hall, and the duke picked it up, saying, as he had said before, that he accepted the challenge in the name of his vassal, and fixed six days thence as the time, the courtyard of the castle as the place, and for arms the customary ones of knights, lance and shield and full armour, with all the other accessories, without trickery, guile, or charms of any sort, and examined and passed by the judges of the field. “But first of all,” he said, “it is requisite that this worthy duenna and unworthy damsel should place their claim for justice in the hands of Don Quixote; for otherwise nothing can be done, nor can the said challenge be brought to a lawful issue.”\\n\\n “I do so place it,” replied the duenna.\\n\\n “And I too,” added her daughter, all in tears and covered with shame and confusion.\\n\\n This declaration having been made, and the duke having settled in his own mind what he would do in the matter, the ladies in black withdrew, and the duchess gave orders that for the future they were not to be treated as servants of hers, but as lady adventurers who came to her house to demand justice; so they gave them a room to themselves and waited on them as they would on strangers, to the consternation of the other women-servants, who did not know where the folly and imprudence of Dona Rodriguez and her unlucky daughter would stop.\\n\\n And now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner to a satisfactory end, lo and behold the page who had carried the letters and presents to Teresa Panza, the wife of the governor Sancho, entered the hall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him, being anxious to know the result of his journey; but when they asked him the page said in reply that he could not give it before so many people or in a few words, and begged their excellences to be pleased to let it wait for a private opportunity, and in the meantime amuse themselves with these letters; and taking out the letters he placed them in the duchess’s hand. One bore by way of address, Letter for my lady the Duchess So-and-so, of I don’t know where; and the other To my husband Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria, whom God prosper longer than me. The duchess’s bread would not bake, as the saying is, until she had read her letter; and having looked over it herself and seen that it might be read aloud for the duke and all present to hear, she read out as follows.\\n\\n TERESA Panza’S LETTER TO The DUCHESS.\\n\\n The letter your highness wrote me, my lady, gave me great pleasure, for indeed I found it very welcome. The string of coral beads is very fine, and my husband’s hunting suit does not fall short of it. All this village is very much pleased that your ladyship has made a governor of my good man Sancho; though nobody will believe it, particularly the curate, and Master Nicholas the barber, and the bachelor Samson Carrasco; but I don’t care for that, for so long as it is true, as it is, they may all say what they like; though, to tell the truth, if the coral beads and the suit had not come I would not have believed it either; for in this village everybody thinks my husband a numskull, and except for governing a flock of goats, they cannot fancy what sort of government he can be fit for. God grant it, and direct him according as he sees his children stand in need of it. I am resolved with your worship’s leave, lady of my soul, to make the most of this fair day, and go to Court to stretch myself at ease in a coach, and make all those I have envying me already burst their eyes out; so I beg your excellence to order my husband to send me a small trifle of money, and to let it be something to speak of, because one’s expenses are heavy at the Court; for a loaf costs a real, and meat thirty maravedis a pound, which is beyond everything; and if he does not want me to go let him tell me in time, for my feet are on the fidgets to he off; and my friends and neighbours tell me that if my daughter and I make a figure and a brave show at Court, my husband will come to be known far more by me than I by him, for of course plenty of people will ask, “Who are those ladies in that coach?” and some servant of mine will answer, “The wife and daughter of Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria;” and in this way Sancho will become known, and I’ll be thought well of, and “to Rome for everything.” I am as vexed as vexed can be that they have gathered no acorns this year in our village; for all that I send your highness about half a peck that I went to the wood to gather and pick out one by one myself, and I could find no bigger ones; I wish they were as big as ostrich eggs.\\n\\n Let not your high mightiness forget to write to me; and I will take care to answer, and let you know how I am, and whatever news there may be in this place, where I remain, praying our Lord to have your highness in his keeping and not to forget me.\\n\\n Sancha my daughter, and my son, kiss your worship’s hands.\\n\\n She who would rather see your ladyship than write to you,\\n\\n All were greatly amused by Teresa Panza’s letter, but particularly the duke and duchess; and the duchess asked Don Quixote’s opinion whether they might open the letter that had come for the governor, which she suspected must be very good. Don Quixote said that to gratify them he would open it, and did so, and found that it ran as follows.\\n\\n TERESA Panza’S LETTER TO HER HUSBAND SANCHO PANZA.\\n\\n I got thy letter, Sancho of my soul, and I promise thee and swear as a Catholic Christian that I was within two fingers’ breadth of going mad I was so happy. I can tell thee, brother, when I came to hear that thou wert a governor I thought I should have dropped dead with pure joy; and thou knowest they say sudden joy kills as well as great sorrow; and as for Sanchica thy daughter, she leaked from sheer happiness. I had before me the suit thou didst send me, and the coral beads my lady the duchess sent me round my neck, and the letters in my hands, and there was the bearer of them standing by, and in spite of all this I verily believed and thought that what I saw and handled was all a dream; for who could have thought that a goatherd would come to be a governor of islands? Thou knowest, my friend, what my mother used to say, that one must live long to see much; I say it because I expect to see more if I live longer; for I don’t expect to stop until I see thee a farmer of taxes or a collector of revenue, which are offices where, though the devil carries off those who make a bad use of them, still they make and handle money. My lady the duchess will tell thee the desire I have to go to the Court; consider the matter and let me know thy pleasure; I will try to do honour to thee by going in a coach.\\n\\n Neither the curate, nor the barber, nor the bachelor, nor even the sacristan, can believe that thou art a governor, and they say the whole thing is a delusion or an enchantment affair, like everything belonging to thy master Don Quixote; and Samson says he must go in search of thee and drive the government out of thy head and the madness out of Don Quixote’s skull; I only laugh, and look at my string of beads, and plan out the dress I am going to make for our daughter out of thy suit. I sent some acorns to my lady the duchess; I wish they had been gold. Send me some strings of pearls if they are in fashion in that island. Here is the news of the village; La Berrueca has married her daughter to a good-for-nothing painter, who came here to paint anything that might turn up. The council gave him an order to paint his Majesty’s arms over the door of the town-hall; he asked two ducats, which they paid him in advance; he worked for eight days, and at the end of them had nothing painted, and then said he had no turn for painting such trifling things; he returned the money, and for all that has married on the pretence of being a good workman; to be sure he has now laid aside his paint-brush and taken a spade in hand, and goes to the field like a gentleman. Pedro Lobo’s son has received the first orders and tonsure, with the intention of becoming a priest. Minguilla, Mingo Silvato’s granddaughter, found it out, and has gone to law with him on the score of having given her promise of marriage. Evil tongues say she is with child by him, but he denies it stoutly. There are no olives this year, and there is not a drop of vinegar to be had in the whole village. A company of soldiers passed through here; when they left they took away with them three of the girls of the village; I will not tell thee who they are; perhaps they will come back, and they will be sure to find those who will take them for wives with all their blemishes, good or bad. Sanchica is making bonelace; she earns eight maravedis a day clear, which she puts into a moneybox as a help towards house furnishing; but now that she is a governor’s daughter thou wilt give her a portion without her working for it. The fountain in the plaza has run dry. A flash of lightning struck the gibbet, and I wish they all lit there. I look for an answer to this, and to know thy mind about my going to the Court; and so, God keep thee longer than me, or as long, for I would not leave thee in this world without me.\\n\\n The letters were applauded, laughed over, relished, and admired; and then, as if to put the seal to the business, the courier arrived, bringing the one Sancho sent to Don Quixote, and this, too, was read out, and it raised some doubts as to the governor’s simplicity. The duchess withdrew to hear from the page about his adventures in Sancho’s village, which he narrated at full length without leaving a single circumstance unmentioned. He gave her the acorns, and also a cheese which Teresa had given him as being particularly good and superior to those of Tronchon. The duchess received it with greatest delight, in which we will leave her, to describe the end of the government of the great Sancho Panza, flower and mirror of all governors of islands.\\n\\n \\n\\n 的唐娜罗德里格斯的奇遇\\n\\n 锡德·哈迈德说到唐吉诃德的伤口已经愈合，于是他觉得继续在那个城堡里住下去有悖于他所奉行的骑士道，便决定请求公爵和公爵夫人允许他到萨拉戈萨去。萨拉戈萨的节日已经临近，唐吉诃德想在节日里参加比武赢一副盔甲。一天，他同公爵和公爵夫人一起吃饭。他正要张口说出自己的请求，忽然看见大门口进来两个女人，她们从头到脚都罩着黑衣服。其中一人走到唐吉诃德面前伏了下来，嘴贴着他的脚抽泣起来。她抽泣得如此伤心，如此深切，如此悲痛，使得所有在场的人都不知所措了。尽管公爵和公爵夫人猜想，可能是佣人们又要拿唐吉诃德开心，可是看到那女人唉声叹气并且哭得那么悲切，也觉得莫名其妙了。最后，还是唐吉诃德动了恻隐之心，把那女人扶了起来，让她揭去蒙在头上的黑纱，露出脸来。那女人把黑纱拿了下来，大家万万没想到原来是女佣唐娜罗德里格斯。另一个穿黑衣服的女人是她那个遭富农儿子耍弄的女儿。所有认识她们的人都大为吃惊，尤其是公爵和公爵夫人。虽然他们觉得唐娜罗德里格斯有些呆头呆脑，而且脾气也怪，却没想到她会做出这种疯事来。唐娜罗德里格斯向公爵和公爵夫人转过身来说道：\\n\\n “请你们允许我同这位骑士说几句话，只有这样我才能摆脱一个心怀叵测的家伙对我的无礼行为。”\\n\\n 公爵说他允许唐娜罗德里格斯同唐吉诃德大人说话，而且想说什么都可以。唐娜罗德里格斯转向唐吉诃德说道：\\n\\n “英勇的骑士，前两天我已经向您讲过一个坏农夫糟蹋我心爱的女儿的事情，这个不幸的姑娘就在您眼前。您曾答应我要保护她，要为她所遭受的痛苦伸张正义，可我现在却听说您要离开这座城堡，去追求上帝赐予您的好运。我想让您在上路之前向那个野小子挑战，让他同我女儿结婚，实现他在同我女儿结合之前许下的诺言。要指望我的主人公爵主持公道，那是白日做梦，这里面的原因我私下已经同您讲过了。为此，愿上帝保佑您身体健康长寿，保佑我们能够得到您的庇护。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德对此一本正经地答道：\\n\\n “好女佣，擦干你的眼泪吧，或者说，你不要再唉声叹气了。我来负责拯救你的女儿。其实，当初她不轻信情人的诺言就好了，这种诺言常常是说得容易实现难。这样吧，只要我的主人公爵允许，我马上就去找那个没良心的家伙。找到他我就向他挑战。如果他逃避兑现他的诺言，我就立刻杀了他。我的主要职责就是惩强扶弱，也就是说，帮助弱者，惩罚强暴者。”\\n\\n “您不必费力去找这位善良的女佣所指责的农夫了。”公爵说，“您也不必请求我允许您向他挑战了。现在，我就确认这场决斗，并且负责把你的挑战通知他，让他到我的城堡来应战。我将在城堡里为你们提供可靠的场地，并且像其他所有在自己的领地内为交战双方提供场地的贵族一样，保证对双方不偏不倚。”\\n\\n “既然您允许，而且又这么肯定，”唐吉诃德说，“那么我就在此宣布，这次我放弃我的贵族身份，自贬为平民，以便与这个害人的家伙平起平坐，让他能够同我决斗。虽然他现在不在场，我也宣布向他挑战。他做了坏事，没有履行对这个可怜姑娘的诺言，玷污了她的清白。他必须履行他答应做这个姑娘的丈夫的诺言，或者是为此而丧命。”\\n\\n 说完唐吉诃德就摘下一只手套，扔到了大厅中央。公爵把手套拾了起来，说就像刚才自己说过的那样，他以他那位臣民的名义接受挑战，并且确定日期就在六天之后，地点就在城堡的一块空场上。骑士们惯用的各种武器，包括长矛、盾牌、合成盔甲①以及各种附件都一应俱全，而且要经过裁判官的检查，无一作假。\\n\\n ①一种可拆卸的盔甲，以利于骑士的行动。\\n\\n “不过，在此之前需要我这位好女佣和苦命的姑娘赋予唐吉诃德全权，让他为她们主持公道，否则就不算数，连这次挑战也不能算数。”\\n\\n “我全权委托他。”女佣说。\\n\\n “我也全权委托他。”那姑娘满面泪痕，既羞愧又沮丧地接着说道。\\n\\n 事情敲定了，公爵也想好了下面该怎么做。两个穿黑衣服的女人离开了大厅。公爵夫人吩咐从那以后不要再把她们看作佣人，而要把她们看成是跑到公爵家来请求公道的江湖女子，并且为她们单独准备了房间，把她们当成外人看待。这一下其他女佣可有点害怕了，不知道愚蠢放肆的唐娜罗德里格斯和她倒霉的女儿会把事情弄到什么地步。这时，为了凑热闹活跃气氛，让人愉快地吃完这顿饭，给桑乔·潘萨总督的夫人特雷莎·潘萨送信和礼物的侍童进来了。他这一到，公爵和公爵夫人都高兴起来，他们急于知道侍童此行的情况。他们问侍童，侍童说不便在大庭广众面前讲，而且也不是几句话就可以说完的，请求主人允许他以后再单独同他们讲，现在则可以先看看回信。侍童说着拿出了两封信，交给公爵夫人。一封信上面写着“不知何在的公爵夫人收”，另一封上面写着“巴拉塔里亚岛总督、我的丈夫桑乔·潘萨收，愿上帝让他比我多享福”。\\n\\n 公爵夫人迫不及待。她打开信看了一遍，觉得可以让公爵和其他在场的人听，便念起来：\\n\\n 特雷莎·潘萨给公爵夫人的信\\n\\n 亲爱的夫人，很高兴收到您的来信，说实话，这封信我期待已久。珊瑚珠很好看，我丈夫的猎服也不错。这儿的人听说您让我丈夫桑乔当了总督，都非常高兴，尽管有些人并不相信，特别是神甫、理发师尼古拉斯师傅和参孙·卡拉斯科学士。不过，我对此无所谓，随它去吧，他们愿意怎么说就让他们去说吧。说实话，如果不是见到珊瑚珠和猎服，我也不会相信，因为这儿的人都把我丈夫看成笨蛋，除了能管一群羊外，无法想象他还能管好什么。但愿上帝保佑他当好总督，这对子女们也有利。有利时机不可错过，尊贵的夫人，我已经决定，只要您允许，我就乘车到京城去，让那些嫉妒我的人把眼珠子都气出来。所以，我请求您让我丈夫给我寄点儿钱来，得要一笔钱呢。因为京城的开销很大，面包论雷阿尔卖，肉论磅卖，三十马拉维迪一磅，真够贵的。如果他不想让我去，也早点儿告诉我。我现在已经像热锅上的蚂蚁，急着要上路呢。我的女朋友和女邻居们都对我说，如果我和我女儿在京城春风得意，神气活现，那么，就是我丈夫靠我们出了名，而不是我们靠他出了名。那时候很多人肯定会问：‘车上的夫人是什么人？’我的佣人就会回答：‘是巴拉塔里亚岛总督桑乔·潘萨的夫人和女儿。’这样桑乔就出名了，我也身价倍增，反正我是豁出去了。\\n\\n 很抱歉，今年我们这儿橡子歉收。尽管如此，我还是为您送去半塞雷敏的橡子，这些都是我到山上一个一个捡来的，我捡的都是最大的。我很希望它们个个都像驼鸟蛋那么大。\\n\\n 请您务必给我写信，我也一定给您回信，告诉您我的身体状况和这儿的各种情况。我请求上帝保佑您，也保佑我。我的女儿桑奇卡和儿子吻您的手。我不仅愿意给您写信，而且更愿意见到您。\\n\\n 您的仆人\\n\\n 特雷莎·潘萨\\n\\n 大家听公爵夫人念完特雷莎·潘萨的这封信，都觉得很有意思，尤其是公爵和公爵夫人。公爵夫人问唐吉诃德，是否可以把特雷莎·潘萨给总督的信也打开看看，估计也非常有意思。唐吉诃德说他可以把信拆开，以飨众人。唐吉诃德把信拆开了，信是这样写的：\\n\\n 特雷莎·潘萨给丈夫桑乔·潘萨的信\\n\\n 我亲爱的桑乔，来信收到了。我向你保证，并且以一个基督教徒的身份发誓，我差点儿高兴得疯了。你听着，伙计，我一听说你成了总督，就高兴得以为自己快要死过去了。听说突如其来的喜悦也会像巨大的痛苦一样让人毙命。你女儿桑奇卡高兴得眼泪都出来了，可是她自己却不知道。你派人送来的衣服就在我眼前，公爵夫人送给我的珊瑚珠就挂在我脖子上，信就在我手上，信使就在我身旁。即使这样，我还是觉得我看到摸到的都是一场梦。谁能想到一个牧羊人能够成为岛屿的总督呢？你也知道，伙计，我母亲常说：“人活得长，才见识多。”我这么说是因为我想活得长，见得多，直到看见你成为税吏的时候。虽然那种差事干得不好会去见阎王，但他们手里总是有钱。女主人公爵夫人会向你转达我想去京城的愿望。你考虑一下，决定之后告诉我。我打算乘车去京城，为你争光。\\n\\n 神甫、理发师，甚至包括教堂司事，都不相信你当了总督，说这是一种哄骗或者魔法之类的事情，就像你主人唐吉诃德遇到的那些事情一样。参孙还说要去找你，把你头脑里的总督赶走，也除掉唐吉诃德脑袋里的疯狂。我对此只是一笑置之，然后看看自己的珊瑚珠，盘算着怎样把你的衣服给女儿穿。\\n\\n 我送给公爵夫人一点儿橡子，但愿它们都是最好的。如果那个岛上时兴珍珠项链，你给我带几串来。\\n\\n 咱们这儿的新闻就是贝鲁埃卡把她的女儿嫁给了一个糟糕的画家，他到咱们这儿来看看有什么好画的。村委会让他把国王的徽记画在村委会的门上。他要两个杜卡多，结果画了八天，什么也没画出来。他说他不善于画这种零七八碎的东西，又把钱还回来了。即使这样，他还是以画家的名义结了婚。实际上他已经不再画画儿了，而是拿起锄头下地干活，也算个正经人了。佩德罗·德洛沃的儿子已经准备出家当教士。明戈·西尔瓦托的孙女明吉利娅则要求他履行诺言，同自己结婚。有些碎嘴的人说她怀的孩子就是他的，可是他矢口否认。\\n\\n 今年油橄榄没有收成，全村找不到一滴醋。有一队士兵从咱们村路过，顺便带走了三个姑娘。我不想告诉你是哪三个人。也许她们还会回来。无论她们是不是有事，我想，肯定会有人愿意娶她们为妻。\\n\\n 桑奇卡织花边，每天可以挣八个马拉维迪。她把钱放在储钱罐里，以后可以补充她的嫁妆。不过，现在她已经是总督的女儿了，即使不干活，你也可以给她准备嫁妆了。广场上的泉眼干涸了，一个闪电击到山峰上，可是这些跟我又有什么关系呢！\\n\\n 我等着你的回信以及有关我去京城的决定。愿上帝保佑你比我活得更长，或者同我活得一样长，因为我不想让你单独留在这个世界上。\\n\\n 你的妻子\\n\\n 特雷莎·潘萨\\n\\n 大家对这两封信大加赞扬，谈笑不休。这时邮差又带来了桑乔给唐吉诃德的信，大家也把这封信念了一遍。于是人们对桑乔到底是否蠢笨开始怀疑了。公爵夫人退了出去，问了侍童有关他在桑乔家乡遇到的情况。侍童一五一十地讲了一遍，除了把橡子交给公爵夫人外，还呈上特雷莎送给她的一块奶酪。那块奶酪特别好，比特龙琼出产的奶酪还要好。公爵夫人非常高兴地收下了奶酪。我们暂且先不谈公爵夫人，而是去看看海岛总督的精英桑乔·潘萨如何结束他的总督任职吧。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4673.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
