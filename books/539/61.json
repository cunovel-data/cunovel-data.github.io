{"id":42201,"no":61,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 7","content":"The instant the housekeeper saw Sancho Panza shut himself in with her master, she guessed what they were about; and suspecting that the result of the consultation would be a resolve to undertake a third sally, she seized her mantle, and in deep anxiety and distress, ran to find the bachelor Samson Carrasco, as she thought that, being a well-spoken man, and a new friend of her master’s , he might be able to persuade him to give up any such crazy notion. She found him pacing the patio of his house, and, perspiring and flurried, she fell at his feet the moment she saw him.\n Carrasco, seeing how distressed and overcome she was, said to her, “What is this, mistress housekeeper? What has happened to you? One would think you heart-broken.”\n “Nothing, Senor Samson,” said she, “only that my master is breaking out, plainly breaking out.”\n “Whereabouts is he breaking out, senora?” asked Samson; “has any part of his body burst?”\n “He is only breaking out at the door of his madness,” she replied; “I mean, dear senor bachelor, that he is going to break out again (and this will be the third time) to hunt all over the world for what he calls ventures, though I can’t make out why he gives them that name. The first time he was brought back to us slung across the back of an ass, and belaboured all over; and the second time he came in an ox-cart, shut up in a cage, in which he persuaded himself he was enchanted, and the poor creature was in such a state that the mother that bore him would not have known him; lean, yellow, with his eyes sunk deep in the cells of his skull; so that to bring him round again, ever so little, cost me more than six hundred eggs, as God knows, and all the world, and my hens too, that won’t let me tell a lie.”\n “That I can well believe,” replied the bachelor, “for they are so good and so fat, and so well-bred, that they would not say one thing for another, though they were to burst for it. In short then, mistress housekeeper, that is all, and there is nothing the matter, except what it is feared Don Quixote may do?”\n “No, senor,” said she.\n “Well then,” returned the bachelor, “don’t be uneasy, but go home in peace; get me ready something hot for breakfast, and while you are on the way say the prayer of Santa Apollonia, that is if you know it; for I will come presently and you will see miracles.”\n “Woe is me,” cried the housekeeper, “is it the prayer of Santa Apollonia you would have me say? That would do if it was the toothache my master had; but it is in the brains, what he has got.”\n “I know what I am saying, mistress housekeeper; go, and don’t set yourself to argue with me, for you know I am a bachelor of Salamanca, and one can’t be more of a bachelor than that,” replied Carrasco; and with this the housekeeper retired, and the bachelor went to look for the curate, and arrange with him what will be told in its proper place.\n While Don Quixote and Sancho were shut up together, they had a discussion which the history records with great precision and scrupulous exactness. Sancho said to his master, “Senor, I have educed my wife to let me go with your worship wherever you choose to take me.”\n “Induced, you should say, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “not educed.”\n “Once or twice, as well as I remember,” replied Sancho, “I have begged of your worship not to mend my words, if so be as you understand what I mean by them; and if you don’t understand them to say ‘Sancho,’ or ‘devil,’ ‘I don’t understand thee; and if I don’t make my meaning plain, then you may correct me, for I am so focile — ”\n “I don’t understand thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at once; “for I know not what ‘I am so focile’ means.”\n “‘So focile’ means I am so much that way,” replied Sancho.\n “I understand thee still less now,” said Don Quixote.\n “Well, if you can’t understand me,” said Sancho, “I don’t know how to put it; I know no more, God help me.”\n “Oh, now I have hit it,” said Don Quixote; “thou wouldst say thou art so docile, tractable, and gentle that thou wilt take what I say to thee, and submit to what I teach thee.”\n “I would bet,” said Sancho, “that from the very first you understood me, and knew what I meant, but you wanted to put me out that you might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders.”\n “May be so,” replied Don Quixote; “but to come to the point, what does Teresa say?”\n “Teresa says,” replied Sancho, “that I should make sure with your worship, and ‘let papers speak and beards be still,’ for ‘he who binds does not wrangle,’ since one ‘take’ is better than two ‘I’ll give thee’s ;’ and I say a woman’s advice is no great thing, and he who won’t take it is a fool.”\n “And so say I,” said Don Quixote; “continue, Sancho my friend; go on; you talk pearls to-day.”\n “The fact is,” continued Sancho, “that, as your worship knows better than I do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day we are, and to-morrow we are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, and nobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than God may be pleased to give him; for death is deaf, and when it comes to knock at our life’s door, it is always urgent, and neither prayers, nor struggles, nor sceptres, nor mitres, can keep it back, as common talk and report say, and as they tell us from the pulpits every day.”\n “All that is very true,” said Don Quixote; “but I cannot make out what thou art driving at.”\n “What I am driving at,” said Sancho, “is that your worship settle some fixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while I am in your service, and that the same he paid me out of your estate; for I don’t care to stand on rewards which either come late, or ill, or never at all; God help me with my own. In short, I would like to know what I am to get, be it much or little; for the hen will lay on one egg, and many littles make a much, and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost. To he sure, if it should happen (what I neither believe nor expect) that your worship were to give me that island you have promised me, I am not so ungrateful nor so grasping but that I would be willing to have the revenue of such island valued and stopped out of my wages in due promotion.”\n “Sancho, my friend,” replied Don Quixote, “sometimes proportion may be as good as promotion.”\n “I see,” said Sancho; “I’ll bet I ought to have said proportion, and not promotion; but it is no matter, as your worship has understood me.”\n “And so well understood,” returned Don Quixote, “that I have seen into the depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting at with the countless shafts of thy proverbs. Look here, Sancho, I would readily fix thy wages if I had ever found any instance in the histories of the knights-errant to show or indicate, by the slightest hint, what their squires used to get monthly or yearly; but I have read all or the best part of their histories, and I cannot remember reading of any knight-errant having assigned fixed wages to his squire; I only know that they all served on reward, and that when they least expected it, if good luck attended their masters, they found themselves recompensed with an island or something equivalent to it, or at the least they were left with a title and lordship. If with these hopes and additional inducements you, Sancho, please to return to my service, well and good; but to suppose that I am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage of knight-errantry, is all nonsense. And so, my Sancho, get you back to your house and explain my intentions to your Teresa, and if she likes and you like to be on reward with me, bene quidem; if not, we remain friends; for if the pigeon-house does not lack food, it will not lack pigeons; and bear in mind, my son, that a good hope is better than a bad holding, and a good grievance better than a bad compensation. I speak in this way, Sancho, to show you that I can shower down proverbs just as well as yourself; and in short, I mean to say, and I do say, that if you don’t like to come on reward with me, and run the same chance that I run, God be with you and make a saint of you; for I shall find plenty of squires more obedient and painstaking, and not so thickheaded or talkative as you are.”\n When Sancho heard his master’s firm, resolute language, a cloud came over the sky with him and the wings of his heart drooped, for he had made sure that his master would not go without him for all the wealth of the world; and as he stood there dumbfoundered and moody, Samson Carrasco came in with the housekeeper and niece, who were anxious to hear by what arguments he was about to dissuade their master from going to seek adventures. The arch wag Samson came forward, and embracing him as he had done before, said with a loud voice, “O flower of knight-errantry! O shining light of arms! O honour and mirror of the Spanish nation! may God Almighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons, who would impede or hinder thy third sally, may find no way out of the labyrinth of their schemes, nor ever accomplish what they most desire!” And then, turning to the housekeeper, he said, “Mistress housekeeper may just as well give over saying the prayer of Santa Apollonia, for I know it is the positive determination of the spheres that Senor Don Quixote shall proceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs; and I should lay a heavy burden on my conscience did I not urge and persuade this knight not to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his valiant spirit any longer curbed and checked, for by his inactivity he is defrauding the world of the redress of wrongs, of the protection of orphans, of the honour of virgins, of the aid of widows, and of the support of wives, and other matters of this kind appertaining, belonging, proper and peculiar to the order of knight-errantry. On, then, my lord Don Quixote, beautiful and brave, let your worship and highness set out to-day rather than to-morrow; and if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose, here am I ready in person and purse to supply the want; and were it requisite to attend your magnificence as squire, I should esteem it the happiest good fortune.”\n At this, Don Quixote, turning to Sancho, said, “Did I not tell thee, Sancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for me? See now who offers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor Samson Carrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the Salamancan schools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger or thirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant’s squire! But heaven forbid that, to gratify my own inclination, I should shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences, and cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts. Let this new Samson remain in his own country, and, bringing honour to it, bring honour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents; for I will be content with any squire that comes to hand, as Sancho does not deign to accompany me.”\n “I do deign,” said Sancho, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes; “it shall not be said of me, master mine,” he continued, “‘the bread eaten and the company dispersed.’ Nay, I come of no ungrateful stock, for all the world knows, but particularly my own town, who the Panzas from whom I am descended were; and, what is more, I know and have learned, by many good words and deeds, your worship’s desire to show me favour; and if I have been bargaining more or less about my wages, it was only to please my wife, who, when she sets herself to press a point, no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants; but, after all, a man must be a man, and a woman a woman; and as I am a man anyhow, which I can’t deny, I will be one in my own house too, let who will take it amiss; and so there’s nothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it can’t be provoked, and let us set out at once, to save Senor Samson’s soul from suffering, as he says his conscience obliges him to persuade your worship to sally out upon the world a third time; so I offer again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally, as well and better than all the squires that served knights-errant in times past or present.”\n The bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard Sancho’s phraseology and style of talk, for though he had read the first part of his master’s history he never thought that he could be so droll as he was there described; but now, hearing him talk of a “will and codicil that could not be provoked,” instead of “will and codicil that could not be revoked,” he believed all he had read of him, and set him down as one of the greatest simpletons of modern times; and he said to himself that two such lunatics as master and man the world had never seen. In fine, Don Quixote and Sancho embraced one another and made friends, and by the advice and with the approval of the great Carrasco, who was now their oracle, it was arranged that their departure should take place three days thence, by which time they could have all that was requisite for the journey ready, and procure a closed helmet, which Don Quixote said he must by all means take. Samson offered him one, as he knew a friend of his who had it would not refuse it to him, though it was more dingy with rust and mildew than bright and clean like burnished steel.\n The curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor were past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they raised a lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as if it had been his death. Samson’s intention in persuading him to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on; all by the advice of the curate and barber, with whom he had previously discussed the subject. Finally, then, during those three days, Don Quixote and Sancho provided themselves with what they considered necessary, and Sancho having pacified his wife, and Don Quixote his niece and housekeeper, at nightfall, unseen by anyone except the bachelor, who thought fit to accompany them half a league out of the village, they set out for El Toboso, Don Quixote on his good Rocinante and Sancho on his old Dapple, his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals, and his purse with money that Don Quixote gave him to meet emergencies. Samson embraced him, and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes, so that he might rejoice over the former or condole with him over the latter, as the laws of friendship required. Don Quixote promised him he would do so, and Samson returned to the village, and the other two took the road for the great city of El Toboso.\n \n 女管家一见桑乔进了他主人的房间，就猜到了桑乔的意图，料想他们又会商量第三次外出的事情。她赶紧披上披风，去找参孙·卡拉斯科学士，觉得他能说会道，又是新结识的朋友，完全可以说服主人放弃那个荒谬的打算。她找到了参孙，参孙正在院子里散步。女管家一见到参孙，就跪到他面前，浑身汗水，满脸忧伤。参孙见她一副难过忧伤的样子，就问道：\n “你怎么了，女管家？出了什么事，看你跟丢了魂似的。”\n “没什么，参孙大人，只是我的主人憋不住了，他肯定憋不住了。”\n “哪儿憋不住了，夫人？”参孙问，“他身上什么地方漏了？”\n “不是哪儿漏了，”女管家说，“而是那疯劲又上来了。我是说，我的宝贝学士大人，他又想出门了，这是他第三次出去到处寻找他叫做运气的东西了①。我也不明白他为什么这样称呼。第一次，他被打得浑身是伤，被人横放在驴上送回来。第二次，他被人关在笼子里用牛车送回来，还自认为是中了魔法。瞧他那副惨相，就是他亲妈也认不出他了，面黄肌瘦，眼睛都快凹进脑子里去了。为了让他能恢复正常，我已经用了六百多个鸡蛋，这个上帝知道，大家也知道，还有我的母鸡，它们是不会让我撒谎的。”\n ①唐吉诃德说要出去征险，而在西班牙语中，“险遇”和女管家说的“运气”只相差一个字母。女管家在此处把唐吉诃德的征险错说成找运气了。\n “这点我完全相信，”学士说，“您那些母鸡养得好，养得肥，即使胀破了肚子也不会乱说的。不过，管家大人，您难道真的只担心唐吉诃德大人要出门，而没有其他什么事情吗？”\n “没有，大人。”女管家说。\n “那您就不用担心了，”学士说，“您赶紧回家去，给我准备点热呼呼的午饭吧。您如果会念《亚波罗尼亚①经》的话，路上就念念《亚波罗尼亚经》吧。我马上就去，到时候您就知道事情有多妙了。”\n ①地名。按照《圣经》，使徒保罗和西拉到帖撒罗马迦传道时曾经过此地。而按照女管家的说法，念《亚波罗尼亚经》可以治牙痛。\n “我的天啊，”女管家说，“您说还得念《亚波罗尼亚经》？\n 就好像我主人的病是在牙上，而不是在脑子里。”\n “我说的没错儿，管家夫人。您赶紧去，别跟我争了。您知道我是在萨拉曼卡毕业的，别跟我斗嘴了。”卡拉斯科说。\n 学士这么一说，女管家才走了。学士去找神甫，同他说了一些话，这些话下面会提到。\n 唐吉诃德和桑乔谈了一番话，这本书都做了准确真实的记录。桑乔对唐吉诃德说：\n “大人，我已经‘摔服’我老婆了，无论您到哪儿去，她都同意我跟随您。”\n “应该是‘说服’，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“不是‘摔服’。”\n “如果我没记错的话，”桑乔说，“我已经对您说过一两次了，只要您听懂了我要说的意思，就别总是纠正我的发音。如果您没听懂，那就说：‘桑乔，见鬼，我没听懂你的话。’那时候您再纠正我。我这个人本来就很‘拴从’……”\n “我没听懂你的话，桑乔，”唐吉诃德马上说，“我不明白‘我很拴从’是什么意思。”\n “就是很‘拴从’，”桑乔说，“我就是这样的人。”\n “我现在更不懂了。”唐吉诃德说。\n “如果你还不懂的话，”桑乔说，“我就不知道该怎么对你说了。我不会其他说法，上帝会明白的。”\n “好，现在我明白了，”唐吉诃德说，“你是想说你非常顺从、温和、听话，也就是我说什么你都能听，我让你干什么你都能凑合干。”\n “我敢打赌，”桑乔说，“您一开始就猜到了是什么意思，就听懂了。您是故意把我弄糊涂，让我多说几句胡话。”\n “也可能是吧。”唐吉诃德说，“咱们现在谈正经的，特雷莎是怎么说的？”\n 桑乔说：“特雷莎让我小心侍候您，少说多做；‘到手一件，胜过许多诺言’；依我说，对女人的话不必在意，可是，不听女人的话又是疯子。”\n “我也这么说。”唐吉诃德说，“说吧，桑乔朋友，你再接着说，你今天说话真可谓句句珠玑。”\n “现在的情况，”桑乔说，“反正您知道得比我更清楚，那就是咱们所有人都不免一死，今天在，也许明天就不在了，无论小羊还是大羊，死亡都来得很突然。在这个世界上，谁也不能保证自己活得比上帝给他规定的寿命长。死亡总是无声无息的，当它来叩我们的生命之门时，总是很匆忙，不管你软求还是硬顶，也不管你有什么权势和高位。大家都这么说，在布道坛上也是这么讲的。”\n “你说得有道理，”唐吉诃德说，“不过，我不明白你的用意何在。”\n “我的用意就是要您明确告诉我，在我服侍您期间，您每月给我多少工钱，而且这工钱得从您的家产里支付，我不想靠赏赐过日子。总之，我想知道我到底挣多少钱，不管是多少，有一个算一个，积少成多，少挣一点儿总比不挣强。我对您许诺给我的岛屿不大相信，也不怎么指望了。不过，您如果真能给我的话，我也不会忘恩负义，把事情做得那么绝，我会把岛上的收入计算出来，再按‘百例’提取我的工钱。”\n “桑乔朋友，”唐吉诃德说，“有时候按‘比例’同按‘百例’一样合适。”\n “我知道了，”桑乔说，“我敢打赌应该说‘比例’而不是‘百例’。不过这没关系，反正您已经明白了。”\n “我太明白了，”唐吉诃德说，“已经明白到你的心底去了。我知道你刚才那些俗话的用意所指了。你听着，桑乔，如果我能从某一本游侠骑士小说里找到例子，哪怕是很小的例子，表明他们每月或每年挣多少工钱，那么，我完全可以确定你的工钱。不过，我读了全部或大部分骑士小说，却不记得看到过哪个游侠骑士给他的侍从确定工钱数额，我只知道侍从们都是靠奖赏取酬的。如果他们的主人顺利，他们会意想不到地得到一个岛屿或其他类似的东西，至少可以得到爵位和称号。如果你是怀着这种愿望和条件愿意再次服侍我，那很好；但如果你想让我在你这儿打破游侠骑士的老规矩，那可没门儿。所以，我的桑乔，你先回家去，把我的意思告诉你的特雷莎吧。假如她愿意，你也愿意跟着我，靠奖赏取酬，自然妙哉；如果不是这样，咱们一如既往还是朋友，‘鸽楼有饲料，不怕没鸽来’。‘好愿望胜过赖收获’。‘埋怨也比掏不起钱强’。我这样说，桑乔，是为了让你明白我也会像你一样俏皮话出口成章。总之，我想告诉你，如果你不愿意跟随我，靠奖赏取酬，与我同舟共济，上帝也会与你同在，让你成为圣人。我不乏侍从，而且，他肯定会比你顺从，比你热心，不像你那么笨，那么爱多嘴。”\n 桑乔听了主人这番斩钉截铁的话，脸上笼罩了一片愁云，心里也凉了半截。他原以为主人没有他就不能周游世界哩。正在他陷入沉思的时候，参孙·卡拉斯科进来了。女管家和外甥女想听听学士如何劝阻唐吉诃德再次出门，也跟着进来了。这个爱开玩笑出了名的参孙一进来，就像上次一样抱住了唐吉诃德，高声说道：\n “噢，游侠骑士的精英，武士的明灯，西班牙的骄傲与典范！你向万能的上帝祈祷吧！谁想阻挠你第三次出征，即使他挖空心思也毫无办法，绞尽脑汁也不会得逞！”\n 他又转过身来对女管家说：\n “管家夫人，您完全可以不念《亚波罗尼亚经》了。我知道，唐吉诃德要去重新履行他的崇高设想是个正确的决定。如果我们再不鼓励这骑士去发挥他的臂膀的勇敢力量和他的高贵无比的慈悲精神，我就会感到于心不忍，也会延误他除暴安良、保护少女孤儿、帮助寡妇和已婚妇女以及其他诸如此类属于游侠骑士的事情。喂，我英俊勇猛的唐吉诃德大人呀，您今天，最迟明天，就该上路了。如果还有什么准备不足的方面，我本人和我的财产都可以予以弥补。假如有必要让我做您的侍从，我将引以为荣。”\n 唐吉诃德这时转过身去，对桑乔说：\n “我不是对你说过吗，桑乔？愿做我的侍从的人多的是！你看，是谁自愿出来做我的侍从？是世上少见的参孙·卡拉斯科学士，萨拉曼卡校园的知足常乐者。他身体健康，手脚灵敏，少言寡语，能够忍受严寒酷暑，能够忍饥挨饿，具备了游侠骑士侍从的各种条件。不过，老天不会允许我仅仅为了自己的利益而糟蹋文坛的骨干、科学的主力，影响优秀自由艺术的发展。还是让这位新秀留在他的故乡吧，为故乡增光，而且可以耀祖光宗。我随便找一个侍从就行了，反正桑乔是不肯跟我去了。”\n “我愿意去，”桑乔已经被说动了心，两眼含着泪水说，“我的大人，您可别说我是过河拆桥的人。我并不属于那种忘恩负义的人。大家都知道，特别是咱们村上的人，都知道桑乔家世世代代是什么样的人，而且我还知道您有意赏给我很多好处和更好的诺言。要说我过多地考虑了我的工钱，那完全是为了取悦我老婆。她谈什么事情，一定要敲得死死的，比木桶箍还紧。不过，男人毕竟是男人，女人还是女人。我无论在哪儿都是男子汉，在家里也要做个男子汉，不管别人愿意不愿意。现在不需要别的了，只要您立个遗嘱，再加个补充条款，这样就不会‘犯悔’了。咱们马上就可以上路，也免得参孙大人着急，他不是说他的良心让他鼓励您第三次游历世界嘛。现在，我再次请求当您忠实合法的侍从，而且要比过去和现在所有游侠骑士的侍从都服侍得好。”\n 学士听了桑乔的这番言论深感惊奇。他虽然读过《唐吉诃德》上卷，却从未想到桑乔真像书上描写的那样滑稽。现在，他听到桑乔把“立个遗嘱，再加个补充条款，这样就不会反悔了”说成“不会犯悔”，对书上的描写就完全相信了。他认定桑乔是当代最大的傻瓜，而这主仆二人是世界上罕见的疯子。\n 最后，唐吉诃德和桑乔互相拥抱言和。此时，参孙已经成了这两个人心目中的权威人物，在参孙的建议和允许下，他们决定三天以后出发。在这三天中，他们要准备行装，而且还要找个头盔，唐吉诃德说无论如何得找个头盔。参孙答应送给唐吉诃德一个头盔，因为他的朋友有头盔，如果去向他要，他不会不给，尽管头盔已经不很亮，锈得发黑了。女管家和外甥女对学士大骂一通自不待言，她们还揪自己的头发，抓自己的脸，像哭丧婆①一般哀嚎唐吉诃德的出行，好像他已经死了似的。至于学士力劝唐吉诃德再次出行的意图，下面将会谈到，这全是按照神甫和理发师的吩咐做的，他们已经事先同学士通了气。\n ①专门雇来哭丧的女人。\n 三天后，唐吉诃德和桑乔觉得已准备妥当了。桑乔安抚好了他的妻子，唐吉诃德也说服了外甥女和女管家。傍晚时分，两人登上了前往托博索的路程。除了学士之外没有人看见他们。学士陪伴他们走了一西里半路。唐吉诃德骑着他驯服的罗西南多，桑乔依然骑着他那头驴，褡裢里带着干粮，衣兜里装着唐吉诃德交给他以防万一用的钱。参孙拥抱了唐吉诃德，叮嘱他不论情况如何一定要设法捎信来，以便与他们同忧共喜，朋友之间本应如此。唐吉诃德答应了。参孙回去了，唐吉诃德和桑乔走向托博索大城。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4628.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
