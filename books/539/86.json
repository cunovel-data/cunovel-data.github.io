{"id":42226,"no":86,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 32","content":"Don Quixote, then, having risen to his feet, trembling from head to foot like a man dosed with mercury, said in a hurried, agitated voice, “The place I am in, the presence in which I stand, and the respect I have and always have had for the profession to which your worship belongs, hold and bind the hands of my just indignation; and as well for these reasons as because I know, as everyone knows, that a gownsman’s weapon is the same as a woman’s, the tongue, I will with mine engage in equal combat with your worship, from whom one might have expected good advice instead of foul abuse. Pious, well-meant reproof requires a different demeanour and arguments of another sort; at any rate, to have reproved me in public, and so roughly, exceeds the bounds of proper reproof, for that comes better with gentleness than with rudeness; and it is not seemly to call the sinner roundly blockhead and booby, without knowing anything of the sin that is reproved. Come, tell me, for which of the stupidities you have observed in me do you condemn and abuse me, and bid me go home and look after my house and wife and children, without knowing whether I have any? Is nothing more needed than to get a footing, by hook or by crook, in other people’s houses to rule over the masters (and that, perhaps, after having been brought up in all the straitness of some seminary, and without having ever seen more of the world than may lie within twenty or thirty leagues round), to fit one to lay down the law rashly for chivalry, and pass judgment on knights-errant? Is it, haply, an idle occupation, or is the time ill-spent that is spent in roaming the world in quest, not of its enjoyments, but of those arduous toils whereby the good mount upwards to the abodes of everlasting life? If gentlemen, great lords, nobles, men of high birth, were to rate me as a fool I should take it as an irreparable insult; but I care not a farthing if clerks who have never entered upon or trod the paths of chivalry should think me foolish. Knight I am, and knight I will die, if such be the pleasure of the Most High. Some take the broad road of overweening ambition; others that of mean and servile flattery; others that of deceitful hypocrisy, and some that of true religion; but I, led by my star, follow the narrow path of knight-errantry, and in pursuit of that calling I despise wealth, but not honour. I have redressed injuries, righted wrongs, punished insolences, vanquished giants, and crushed monsters; I am in love, for no other reason than that it is incumbent on knights-errant to be so; but though I am, I am no carnal-minded lover, but one of the chaste, platonic sort. My intentions are always directed to worthy ends, to do good to all and evil to none; and if he who means this, does this, and makes this his practice deserves to be called a fool, it is for your highnesses to say, O most excellent duke and duchess.” “Good, by God!” cried Sancho; “say no more in your own defence, master mine, for there’s nothing more in the world to be said, thought, or insisted on; and besides, when this gentleman denies, as he has, that there are or ever have been any knights-errant in the world, is it any wonder if he knows nothing of what he has been talking about?” “Perhaps, brother,” said the ecclesiastic, “you are that Sancho Panza that is mentioned, to whom your master has promised an island?” “Yes, I am,” said Sancho, “and what’s more, I am one who deserves it as much as anyone; I am one of the sort — ‘Attach thyself to the good, and thou wilt be one of them,’ and of those, ‘Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art fed,’ and of those, ‘Who leans against a good tree, a good shade covers him;’ I have leant upon a good master, and I have been for months going about with him, and please God I shall be just such another; long life to him and long life to me, for neither will he be in any want of empires to rule, or I of islands to govern.” “No, Sancho my friend, certainly not,” said the duke, “for in the name of Senor Don Quixote I confer upon you the government of one of no small importance that I have at my disposal.” “Go down on thy knees, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and kiss the feet of his excellence for the favour he has bestowed upon thee.” Sancho obeyed, and on seeing this the ecclesiastic stood up from table completely out of temper, exclaiming, “By the gown I wear, I am almost inclined to say that your excellence is as great a fool as these sinners. No wonder they are mad, when people who are in their senses sanction their madness! I leave your excellence with them, for so long as they are in the house, I will remain in my own, and spare myself the trouble of reproving what I cannot remedy;” and without uttering another word, or eating another morsel, he went off, the entreaties of the duke and duchess being entirely unavailing to stop him; not that the duke said much to him, for he could not, because of the laughter his uncalled-for anger provoked. When he had done laughing, he said to Don Quixote, “You have replied on your own behalf so stoutly, Sir Knight of the Lions, that there is no occasion to seek further satisfaction for this, which, though it may look like an offence, is not so at all, for, as women can give no offence, no more can ecclesiastics, as you very well know.” “That is true,” said Don Quixote, “and the reason is, that he who is not liable to offence cannot give offence to anyone. Women, children, and ecclesiastics, as they cannot defend themselves, though they may receive offence cannot be insulted, because between the offence and the insult there is, as your excellence very well knows, this difference: the insult comes from one who is capable of offering it, and does so, and maintains it; the offence may come from any quarter without carrying insult. To take an example: a man is standing unsuspectingly in the street and ten others come up armed and beat him; he draws his sword and quits himself like a man, but the number of his antagonists makes it impossible for him to effect his purpose and avenge himself; this man suffers an offence but not an insult. Another example will make the same thing plain: a man is standing with his back turned, another comes up and strikes him, and after striking him takes to flight, without waiting an instant, and the other pursues him but does not overtake him; he who received the blow received an offence, but not an insult, because an insult must be maintained. If he who struck him, though he did so sneakingly and treacherously, had drawn his sword and stood and faced him, then he who had been struck would have received offence and insult at the same time; offence because he was struck treacherously, insult because he who struck him maintained what he had done, standing his ground without taking to flight. And so, according to the laws of the accursed duel, I may have received offence, but not insult, for neither women nor children can maintain it, nor can they wound, nor have they any way of standing their ground, and it is just the same with those connected with religion; for these three sorts of persons are without arms offensive or defensive, and so, though naturally they are bound to defend themselves, they have no right to offend anybody; and though I said just now I might have received offence, I say now certainly not, for he who cannot receive an insult can still less give one; for which reasons I ought not to feel, nor do I feel, aggrieved at what that good man said to me; I only wish he had stayed a little longer, that I might have shown him the mistake he makes in supposing and maintaining that there are not and never have been any knights-errant in the world; had Amadis or any of his countless descendants heard him say as much, I am sure it would not have gone well with his worship.” “I will take my oath of that,” said Sancho; “they would have given him a slash that would have slit him down from top to toe like a pomegranate or a ripe melon; they were likely fellows to put up with jokes of that sort! By my faith, I’m certain if Reinaldos of Montalvan had heard the little man’s words he would have given him such a spank on the mouth that he wouldn’t have spoken for the next three years; ay, let him tackle them, and he’ll see how he’ll get out of their hands!” The duchess, as she listened to Sancho, was ready to die with laughter, and in her own mind she set him down as droller and madder than his master; and there were a good many just then who were of the same opinion. Don Quixote finally grew calm, and dinner came to an end, and as the cloth was removed four damsels came in, one of them with a silver basin, another with a jug also of silver, a third with two fine white towels on her shoulder, and the fourth with her arms bared to the elbows, and in her white hands (for white they certainly were) a round ball of Naples soap. The one with the basin approached, and with arch composure and impudence, thrust it under Don Quixote’s chin, who, wondering at such a ceremony, said never a word, supposing it to be the custom of that country to wash beards instead of hands; he therefore stretched his out as far as he could, and at the same instant the jug began to pour and the damsel with the soap rubbed his beard briskly, raising snow-flakes, for the soap lather was no less white, not only over the beard, but all over the face, and over the eyes of the submissive knight, so that they were perforce obliged to keep shut. The duke and duchess, who had not known anything about this, waited to see what came of this strange washing. The barber damsel, when she had him a hand’s breadth deep in lather, pretended that there was no more water, and bade the one with the jug go and fetch some, while Senor Don Quixote waited. She did so, and Don Quixote was left the strangest and most ludicrous figure that could be imagined. All those present, and there were a good many, were watching him, and as they saw him there with half a yard of neck, and that uncommonly brown, his eyes shut, and his beard full of soap, it was a great wonder, and only by great discretion, that they were able to restrain their laughter. The damsels, the concocters of the joke, kept their eyes down, not daring to look at their master and mistress; and as for them, laughter and anger struggled within them, and they knew not what to do, whether to punish the audacity of the girls, or to reward them for the amusement they had received from seeing Don Quixote in such a plight. At length the damsel with the jug returned and they made an end of washing Don Quixote, and the one who carried the towels very deliberately wiped him and dried him; and all four together making him a profound obeisance and curtsey, they were about to go, when the duke, lest Don Quixote should see through the joke, called out to the one with the basin saying, “Come and wash me, and take care that there is water enough.” The girl, sharp-witted and prompt, came and placed the basin for the duke as she had done for Don Quixote, and they soon had him well soaped and washed, and having wiped him dry they made their obeisance and retired. It appeared afterwards that the duke had sworn that if they had not washed him as they had Don Quixote he would have punished them for their impudence, which they adroitly atoned for by soaping him as well. Sancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively, and said to himself, “God bless me, if it were only the custom in this country to wash squires’ beards too as well as knights’. For by God and upon my soul I want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of the razor besides I’d take it as a still greater kindness.” “What are you saying to yourself, Sancho?” asked the duchess. “I was saying, senora,” he replied, “that in the courts of other princes, when the cloth is taken away, I have always heard say they give water for the hands, but not lye for the beard; and that shows it is good to live long that you may see much; to be sure, they say too that he who lives a long life must undergo much evil, though to undergo a washing of that sort is pleasure rather than pain.” “Don’t be uneasy, friend Sancho,” said the duchess; “I will take care that my damsels wash you, and even put you in the tub if necessary.” “I’ll be content with the beard,” said Sancho, “at any rate for the present; and as for the future, God has decreed what is to be.” “Attend to worthy Sancho’s request, seneschal,” said the duchess, “and do exactly what he wishes.” The seneschal replied that Senor Sancho should be obeyed in everything; and with that he went away to dinner and took Sancho along with him, while the duke and duchess and Don Quixote remained at table discussing a great variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms and knight-errantry. The duchess begged Don Quixote, as he seemed to have a retentive memory, to describe and portray to her the beauty and features of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, for, judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of her beauty, she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in the world, nay, in all La Mancha. Don Quixote sighed on hearing the duchess’s request, and said, “If I could pluck out my heart, and lay it on a plate on this table here before your highness’s eyes, it would spare my tongue the pain of telling what can hardly be thought of, for in it your excellence would see her portrayed in full. But why should I attempt to depict and describe in detail, and feature by feature, the beauty of the peerless Dulcinea, the burden being one worthy of other shoulders than mine, an enterprise wherein the pencils of Parrhasius, Timantes, and Apelles, and the graver of Lysippus ought to be employed, to paint it in pictures and carve it in marble and bronze, and Ciceronian and Demosthenian eloquence to sound its praises?” “What does Demosthenian mean, Senor Don Quixote?” said the duchess; “it is a word I never heard in all my life.” “Demosthenian eloquence,” said Don Quixote, “means the eloquence of Demosthenes, as Ciceronian means that of Cicero, who were the two most eloquent orators in the world.” “True,” said the duke; “you must have lost your wits to ask such a question. Nevertheless, Senor Don Quixote would greatly gratify us if he would depict her to us; for never fear, even in an outline or sketch she will be something to make the fairest envious.” “I would do so certainly,” said Don Quixote, “had she not been blurred to my mind’s eye by the misfortune that fell upon her a short time since, one of such a nature that I am more ready to weep over it than to describe it. For your highnesses must know that, going a few days back to kiss her hands and receive her benediction, approbation, and permission for this third sally, I found her altogether a different being from the one I sought; I found her enchanted and changed from a princess into a peasant, from fair to foul, from an angel into a devil, from fragrant to pestiferous, from refined to clownish, from a dignified lady into a jumping tomboy, and, in a word, from Dulcinea del Toboso into a coarse Sayago wench.” “God bless me!” said the duke aloud at this, “who can have done the world such an injury? Who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty that shed a lustre upon it?” “Who?” replied Don Quixote; “who could it be but some malignant enchanter of the many that persecute me out of envy — that accursed race born into the world to obscure and bring to naught the achievements of the good, and glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked? Enchanters have persecuted me, enchanters persecute me still, and enchanters will continue to persecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalry in the deep abyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound me where they know I feel it most. For to deprive a knight-errant of his lady is to deprive him of the eyes he sees with, of the sun that gives him light, of the food whereby he lives. Many a time before have I said it, and I say it now once more, a knight-errant without a lady is like a tree without leaves, a building without a foundation, or a shadow without the body that causes it.” “There is no denying it,” said the duchess; “but still, if we are to believe the history of Don Quixote that has come out here lately with general applause, it is to be inferred from it, if I mistake not, that you never saw the lady Dulcinea, and that the said lady is nothing in the world but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begot and gave birth to in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms and perfections you chose.” “There is a good deal to be said on that point,” said Don Quixote; “God knows whether there he any Dulcinea or not in the world, or whether she is imaginary or not imaginary; these are things the proof of which must not be pushed to extreme lengths. I have not begotten nor given birth to my lady, though I behold her as she needs must be, a lady who contains in herself all the qualities to make her famous throughout the world, beautiful without blemish, dignified without haughtiness, tender and yet modest, gracious from courtesy and courteous from good breeding, and lastly, of exalted lineage, because beauty shines forth and excels with a higher degree of perfection upon good blood than in the fair of lowly birth.” “That is true,” said the duke; “but Senor Don Quixote will give me leave to say what I am constrained to say by the story of his exploits that I have read, from which it is to be inferred that, granting there is a Dulcinea in El Toboso, or out of it, and that she is in the highest degree beautiful as you have described her to us, as regards the loftiness of her lineage she is not on a par with the Orianas, Alastrajareas, Madasimas, or others of that sort, with whom, as you well know, the histories abound.” “To that I may reply,” said Don Quixote, “that Dulcinea is the daughter of her own works, and that virtues rectify blood, and that lowly virtue is more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice. Dulcinea, besides, has that within her that may raise her to be a crowned and sceptred queen; for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capable of performing greater miracles; and virtually, though not formally, she has in herself higher fortunes.” “I protest, Senor Don Quixote,” said the duchess, “that in all you say, you go most cautiously and lead in hand, as the saying is; henceforth I will believe myself, and I will take care that everyone in my house believes, even my lord the duke if needs be, that there is a Dulcinea in El Toboso, and that she is living to-day, and that she is beautiful and nobly born and deserves to have such a knight as Senor Don Quixote in her service, and that is the highest praise that it is in my power to give her or that I can think of. But I cannot help entertaining a doubt, and having a certain grudge against Sancho Panza; the doubt is this, that the aforesaid history declares that the said Sancho Panza, when he carried a letter on your worship’s behalf to the said lady Dulcinea, found her sifting a sack of wheat; and more by token it says it was red wheat; a thing which makes me doubt the loftiness of her lineage.” To this Don Quixote made answer, “Senora, your highness must know that everything or almost everything that happens me transcends the ordinary limits of what happens to other knights-errant; whether it he that it is directed by the inscrutable will of destiny, or by the malice of some jealous enchanter. Now it is an established fact that all or most famous knights-errant have some special gift, one that of being proof against enchantment, another that of being made of such invulnerable flesh that he cannot be wounded, as was the famous Roland, one of the twelve peers of France, of whom it is related that he could not be wounded except in the sole of his left foot, and that it must be with the point of a stout pin and not with any other sort of weapon whatever; and so, when Bernardo del Carpio slew him at Roncesvalles, finding that he could not wound him with steel, he lifted him up from the ground in his arms and strangled him, calling to mind seasonably the death which Hercules inflicted on Antaeus, the fierce giant that they say was the son of Terra. I would infer from what I have mentioned that perhaps I may have some gift of this kind, not that of being invulnerable, because experience has many times proved to me that I am of tender flesh and not at all impenetrable; nor that of being proof against enchantment, for I have already seen myself thrust into a cage, in which all the world would not have been able to confine me except by force of enchantments. But as I delivered myself from that one, I am inclined to believe that there is no other that can hurt me; and so, these enchanters, seeing that they cannot exert their vile craft against my person, revenge themselves on what I love most, and seek to rob me of life by maltreating that of Dulcinea in whom I live; and therefore I am convinced that when my squire carried my message to her, they changed her into a common peasant girl, engaged in such a mean occupation as sifting wheat; I have already said, however, that that wheat was not red wheat, nor wheat at all, but grains of orient pearl. And as a proof of all this, I must tell your highnesses that, coming to El Toboso a short time back, I was altogether unable to discover the palace of Dulcinea; and that the next day, though Sancho, my squire, saw her in her own proper shape, which is the fairest in the world, to me she appeared to be a coarse, ill-favoured farm-wench, and by no means a well-spoken one, she who is propriety itself. And so, as I am not and, so far as one can judge, cannot be enchanted, she it is that is enchanted, that is smitten, that is altered, changed, and transformed; in her have my enemies revenged themselves upon me, and for her shall I live in ceaseless tears, until I see her in her pristine state. I have mentioned this lest anybody should mind what Sancho said about Dulcinea’s winnowing or sifting; for, as they changed her to me, it is no wonder if they changed her to him. Dulcinea is illustrious and well-born, and of one of the gentle families of El Toboso, which are many, ancient, and good. Therein, most assuredly, not small is the share of the peerless Dulcinea, through whom her town will be famous and celebrated in ages to come, as Troy was through Helen, and Spain through La Cava, though with a better title and tradition. For another thing; I would have your graces understand that Sancho Panza is one of the drollest squires that ever served knight-errant; sometimes there is a simplicity about him so acute that it is an amusement to try and make out whether he is simple or sharp; he has mischievous tricks that stamp him rogue, and blundering ways that prove him a booby; he doubts everything and believes everything; when I fancy he is on the point of coming down headlong from sheer stupidity, he comes out with something shrewd that sends him up to the skies. After all, I would not exchange him for another squire, though I were given a city to boot, and therefore I am in doubt whether it will be well to send him to the government your highness has bestowed upon him; though I perceive in him a certain aptitude for the work of governing, so that, with a little trimming of his understanding, he would manage any government as easily as the king does his taxes; and moreover, we know already ample experience that it does not require much cleverness or much learning to be a governor, for there are a hundred round about us that scarcely know how to read, and govern like gerfalcons. The main point is that they should have good intentions and be desirous of doing right in all things, for they will never be at a loss for persons to advise and direct them in what they have to do, like those knight-governors who, being no lawyers, pronounce sentences with the aid of an assessor. My advice to him will be to take no bribe and surrender no right, and I have some other little matters in reserve, that shall be produced in due season for Sancho’s benefit and the advantage of the island he is to govern.” The duke, duchess, and Don Quixote had reached this point in their conversation, when they heard voices and a great hubbub in the palace, and Sancho burst abruptly into the room all glowing with anger, with a straining-cloth by way of a bib, and followed by several servants, or, more properly speaking, kitchen-boys and other underlings, one of whom carried a small trough full of water, that from its colour and impurity was plainly dishwater. The one with the trough pursued him and followed him everywhere he went, endeavouring with the utmost persistence to thrust it under his chin, while another kitchen-boy seemed anxious to wash his beard. “What is all this, brothers?” asked the duchess. “What is it? What do you want to do to this good man? Do you forget he is a governor-elect?” To which the barber kitchen-boy replied, “The gentleman will not let himself be washed as is customary, and as my lord the and the senor his master have been.” “Yes, I will,” said Sancho, in a great rage; “but I’d like it to be with cleaner towels, clearer lye, and not such dirty hands; for there’s not so much difference between me and my master that he should be washed with angels’ water and I with devil’s lye. The customs of countries and princes’ palaces are only good so long as they give no annoyance; but the way of washing they have here is worse than doing penance. I have a clean beard, and I don’t require to be refreshed in that fashion, and whoever comes to wash me or touch a hair of my head, I mean to say my beard, with all due respect be it said, I’ll give him a punch that will leave my fist sunk in his skull; for cirimonies and soapings of this sort are more like jokes than the polite attentions of one’s host.” The duchess was ready to die with laughter when she saw Sancho’s rage and heard his words; but it was no pleasure to Don Quixote to see him in such a sorry trim, with the dingy towel about him, and the hangers-on of the kitchen all round him; so making a low bow to the duke and duchess, as if to ask their permission to speak, he addressed the rout in a dignified tone: “Holloa, gentlemen! you let that youth alone, and go back to where you came from, or anywhere else if you like; my squire is as clean as any other person, and those troughs are as bad as narrow thin-necked jars to him; take my advice and leave him alone, for neither he nor I understand joking.” Sancho took the word out of his mouth and went on, “Nay, let them come and try their jokes on the country bumpkin, for it’s about as likely I’ll stand them as that it’s now midnight! Let them bring me a comb here, or what they please, and curry this beard of mine, and if they get anything out of it that offends against cleanliness, let them clip me to the skin.” Upon this, the duchess, laughing all the while, said, “Sancho Panza is right, and always will be in all he says; he is clean, and, as he says himself, he does not require to be washed; and if our ways do not please him, he is free to choose. Besides, you promoters of cleanliness have been excessively careless and thoughtless, I don’t know if I ought not to say audacious, to bring troughs and wooden utensils and kitchen dishclouts, instead of basins and jugs of pure gold and towels of holland, to such a person and such a beard; but, after all, you are ill-conditioned and ill-bred, and spiteful as you are, you cannot help showing the grudge you have against the squires of knights-errant.” The impudent servitors, and even the seneschal who came with them, took the duchess to be speaking in earnest, so they removed the straining-cloth from Sancho’s neck, and with something like shame and confusion of face went off all of them and left him; whereupon he, seeing himself safe out of that extreme danger, as it seemed to him, ran and fell on his knees before the duchess, saying, “From great ladies great favours may be looked for; this which your grace has done me today cannot be requited with less than wishing I was dubbed a knight-errant, to devote myself all the days of my life to the service of so exalted a lady. I am a labouring man, my name is Sancho Panza, I am married, I have children, and I am serving as a squire; if in any one of these ways I can serve your highness, I will not he longer in obeying than your grace in commanding.” “It is easy to see, Sancho,” replied the duchess, “that you have learned to he polite in the school of politeness itself; I mean to say it is easy to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of Senor Don Quixote, who is, of course, the cream of good breeding and flower of ceremony — or cirimony, as you would say yourself. Fair be the fortunes of such a master and such a servant, the one the cynosure of knight-errantry, the other the star of squirely fidelity! Rise, Sancho, my friend; I will repay your courtesy by taking care that my lord the duke makes good to you the promised gift of the government as soon as possible.” With this, the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote retired to take his midday sleep; but the duchess begged Sancho, unless he had a very great desire to go to sleep, to come and spend the afternoon with her and her damsels in a very cool chamber. Sancho replied that, though he certainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in the heat of the day in summer, to serve her excellence he would try with all his might not to sleep even one that day, and that he would come in obedience to her command, and with that he went off. The duke gave fresh orders with respect to treating Don Quixote as a knight-errant, without departing even in smallest particular from the style in which, as the stories tell us, they used to treat the knights of old. 唐吉诃德站了起来，颤抖着全身，声音急促而又含糊地说道： “此地此时以及我对您所处地位的一贯尊重，压抑了我的正义怒火。还有，就是我说过的，所有穿长袍的人都使用同女人一样的武器，那就是舌头。所以，我也只想同您开始一场舌战。我本来以为您会好言相劝，却没想到您竟然出口伤人。进行善意有效的指责应该选择其他场合，需要一定的条件。您刚才当众尖刻地指责我，显然已经完全超出了善意指责的范围。善意的指责最好是和颜悦色，而不是疾言厉色，而且，更不应该在还没搞清自己指责的对象究竟有没有错的时候，就无缘无故地指责人家是笨蛋、蠢货。请您告诉我，我究竟做了什么蠢事，值得您如此指责我？您让我回家去管好家，您可知道我有没有老婆孩子，就让我去管好老婆孩子？有的人自己在小家小户长大，所见识的只不过是他们村周围方圆二三十里地方的事，却钻到别人家去教训人，还规定骑士道应该如何如何，对游侠骑士评头品足，这难道不是胡闹吗？如果一个人东奔西走，不谋私利，历尽千辛万苦，最后得以留芳千古，你能说他虚度光阴、枉费年华吗？如果是各类骑士和各类出类拔萃、慷慨大方、出身名门的人把我看成傻瓜，我无可非议；可如果是那些从未涉足骑士道的学究把我说成是蠢货，我不以为然。我就是骑士，如果上帝愿意，我这个骑士可以去死。有的人有追求广阔天地的雄心大志，有的人有阿谀奉承的奴颜媚骨，有的人贪图虚伪的自我欺骗，还有的人追求一种真正的信仰。而我呢，只按照我的命运的指引，走游侠骑士的狭窄之路。为此，我鄙夷钱财，却不放弃荣誉。我曾经为人雪耻，拨乱反正，惩处暴孽，战胜巨人，打败妖怪。我也多情，而游侠骑士必然如此。可我不是那种低级情人，我只追求高尚的精神向往。我一直保持着我的良好追求，即善待大家，不恶对一人。请尊贵的公爵和公爵夫人评评，一个如此情趣、如此行事、如此追求的人是否应当被人称为傻瓜？” “天啊，说得真好！”桑乔说，“您不必再说下去了，我的大人，我的主人，因为这个世界上已经没什么可再说、再想、再主张的了。这位大人一再坚持说，无论过去还是现在，世界上都没有游侠骑士。这是因为他对此一无所知，才这样说，这又有什么可奇怪的呢？” “大概你就是那个桑乔吧，兄弟？”教士问，“据说你的主人曾许诺过给你一个岛屿？” “我就是桑乔，”桑乔说，“而且我也同别人一样，当得了总督。我是‘近朱者赤’，属于那种‘不求同日生，但要同日过’，‘背靠大树好乘凉’的人。我已经找到了一个好主人，并且陪伴他很多个月了。假如上帝愿意，我也会变得同他一样。他长寿我也长寿；他不乏统帅的威严，我也会成为岛屿总督。” “确实如此，桑乔。”公爵此时说道，“我这儿正好有一个不错的岛屿，没人管理，现在我就代表唐吉诃德大人，把它分配给你。” “赶紧跪下，桑乔！”唐吉诃德说，“快吻公爵大人的脚，感谢他对你的恩赐。” 桑乔照办了。教士见状极其愤怒地从桌子旁站起身来，说道： “我以我的教袍发誓，您像这两个罪人一样愚蠢。连明白人都变疯了，疯子岂不更疯！您接着陪他们吧。只要他们还在这儿，我就回我家去。既然说了也无济于事，我省得白费口舌。” 教士不再多说，什么也没吃便离去了。公爵夫妇请求他留下也无济于事，公爵就不再说了。他觉得教士如此生气大可不必，他已经笑得说不出话来了。 公爵最后终于止住了笑，对唐吉诃德说道： “狮子骑士大人，您回答得太高明了，使得他无言以对。虽然他觉得这是对他的冒犯，可事实绝非如此。您很清楚，这就如同妇女不冒犯别人一样，教士也从不冒犯别人。” “是这样。”唐吉诃德说，“道理就在于：不应该受到冒犯的人也不应该去冒犯别人。妇女、儿童和教士即使受到攻击也不能自卫，所以他们不应该受到凌辱。冒犯与凌辱之间有这种区别，这点您很清楚。凌辱来自于能够做到、已经做到而且仍坚持做的一方；而冒犯可能来自于任何一方，但是这并不等于凌辱。举例说吧：一个人在大街上漫不经心地走，忽然来了十个手持武器的人，把他打了。尽管他拔剑尽力自卫，仍然寡不敌众，最终没能达到自己的目的，也就是报仇。这个人受到的就是冒犯，而不是凌辱。同样的情况还可以再举另外一个例子：如果一个人正在走路，背后来了一个人打他，而且打完了就跑。挨打的人追他，结果没追上。这个挨打的人受到的也是冒犯，而不是凌辱。如果打人者还坚持打他，那才是凌辱。如果那个人打了他，尽管是突然袭击，可随后仍然持剑原地不动，面对自己的对手，那么挨打的人就是既受到了冒犯，又受到了凌辱。说他受到了冒犯是因为那个人对他突然袭击；说他受到了凌辱是因为打他的那个人不仅没有逃跑，反而留在原地不动。 “所以，按照这个决斗的规则，我很可能受到了冒犯，但是没有受到凌辱。儿童们不懂事，同妇女们一样逃跑不了，而且他们也没有能力坚持对抗。宗教界的人也同样如此。前面说到的这三种人缺少进攻和防御的能力。虽然他们本能地要保护自己，可他们无法冒犯任何人。我刚才说我可能受到了冒犯，但现在一想，这根本算不上冒犯。不能凌辱别人的人，自己也谈不上受到污辱。因此我不该生气，其实也并没有为那位善良人说我的那些话生气。我只希望过一段时间后，他能够明白，他以为世界上过去和现在都没有游侠骑士的想法是错误的。如果阿马迪斯或者他家旅中的某个子孙知道了这件事，我想这对他就不妙了。” “这点我敢肯定，”桑乔说，“他们肯定会把他像切石榴或熟透了的甜瓜似的从头到脚劈开。他们若是发起怒来可叫人够受的！我凭我的信仰发誓，我敢肯定，假如雷纳尔多斯·德蒙塔尔万听见了这小子说的话，准会一个嘴巴打得他三年说不出话来。谁要是惹了他们又想逃出他们的手心，那才是怪事呢。” 公爵夫人听了桑乔的话觉得很可笑。她觉得桑乔比唐吉诃德更滑稽更疯癫。当时在场的许多人也都这么想。 唐吉诃德终于平静下来了。宴请结束，撤去台布，又来了四个侍女。其中一个手里端着一个银盘，另一个端着一个洗手盆，也是银的，还有一个肩上搭着两块极白极高级的毛巾，最后一个裸露着半截胳膊，她那双雪白的手上托着一块那不勒斯出产的圆形香皂。托盘的侍女走过来，潇洒而又灵活地把盘子举到唐吉诃德的胡子下面。唐吉诃德一句话也没说，对眼前这个侍女的举动感到惊奇，以为这是当地的什么习惯，不洗手反倒洗胡子，于是他尽可能地把胡子往前凑。端洗手盆的侍女立刻往唐吉诃德的脸上撩水，拿香皂的侍女用手在唐吉诃德的脸上急速地抹香皂，唐吉诃德老老实实地任凭她涂抹，结果不仅他的胡子，而且他的整个脸甚至眼睛上都是雪花似的香皂沫了，唐吉诃德只好使劲闭上眼睛。公爵和公爵夫人不知其中实情，只是眼睁睁地看着侍女们到底要干什么。待唐吉诃德脸上的香皂沫有一拃厚时，涂香皂沫的侍女推说没有洗脸水了，叫端盆的侍女去加水，让唐吉诃德等着。唐吉诃德只好等在那里，当时他那可笑的样子可想而知。 当时在场的人很多，大家都看着唐吉诃德。他们见唐吉诃德把他那深褐色的脖子伸得足有半尺长，紧闭着眼睛，胡子上全是香皂沫，实在令人忍俊不禁。侍女们都低着头，不敢看自己的主人。公爵和公爵夫人觉得这些侍女既可气又可笑，不知该如何是好，到底是对她们的恶作剧进行惩罚呢，还是为她们把唐吉诃德弄成这个样子，给大家带来了快乐而给予奖励。端水盆的侍女回来后，她们为唐吉诃德洗了脸，拿毛巾的侍女为唐吉诃德仔细擦干了脸。然后，四个侍女一齐向唐吉诃德深深鞠了一躬，准备离去。可是公爵为了不让唐吉诃德看破这个恶作剧，便叫过端盆子的侍女来，对她说： “过来帮我洗洗，你看水还没用完呢。” 侍女很机灵，走过来像对唐吉诃德那样把盆子端给公爵，并且迅速而又认真地为公爵洗脸涂香皂，并且为公爵把脸擦干净，然后鞠躬退了出去。事后才得知，原来公爵觉得如果不像唐吉诃德那样也给他洗洗脸，侍女们肯定会因为她们的恶作剧而受到惩罚。既然同样为公爵洗了脸，事情就可以巧妙地掩饰过去了。 桑乔仔细地看着这种洗脸方式，心里想：“上帝保佑，这个地方是否像给骑士洗胡子一样，也有为侍从洗胡子的习惯？无论对上帝而言还是对我而言，显然都需要这么洗洗。若是再能用剃刀刮刮胡子，那就更妙了。” “你说什么，桑乔？”公爵夫人问。 “我是说，夫人，”桑乔说，“我听说过在别处王宫贵府吃完饭要洗手，但从没听说过要洗胡子。到底还是活得越久越好，这样见识就更多。谁说活得越长，倒霉就越多呀？这样洗洗胡子毕竟不是受罪嘛。” “别着急，桑乔，”公爵夫人说，“我让侍女们也给你洗洗胡子，以后必要时甚至可以给你大洗一通。” “只要现在能给我洗洗胡子我就知足了，”桑乔说，“至于以后怎么样，那就看上帝怎么说了。” “当差的，”公爵夫人对餐厅侍者说，“你就按这位好桑乔要求的去做吧，他要怎么办就怎么办。” 侍者说他愿全力为桑乔效劳，说完就带着桑乔去吃饭了。只剩下公爵夫妇和唐吉诃德天南海北地聊天，不过，都没离开习武和游侠骑士的话题。 公爵夫人请唐吉诃德描绘一下杜尔西内亚的美貌和面孔，说唐吉诃德对此肯定有幸福的回忆，据她所知，杜尔西内亚夫人的美貌不仅名扬四海，而且连曼查都知道了！唐吉诃德听了公爵夫人的话，长叹一声说道： “假如我能够把我的心掏出来，放在您面前这张桌子上的一个盘子里，您就可以看见印在我心上的倩影，用不着我再费口舌描述她那难以形容的美貌了。不过，为什么要让我来仔细描述举世无双的杜尔西内亚的美貌呢？这件事也许别人更能胜任，像帕拉西奥、蒂曼特斯、阿佩勒斯，可以用他们的画笔，利西波可以用他的镂刀，把杜尔西内亚的相貌刻画在大理石和青铜器上；还有西塞罗和德摩斯梯尼，可以用他们的文辞来赞美她。” “什么是德摩斯梯尼文辞，唐吉诃德大人？”公爵夫人问，“我还从来没听说过呢。” “‘德摩斯梯尼文辞’就是‘德摩斯梯尼的文辞’，就好比说‘西塞罗文辞’是‘西塞罗的文辞’一样。他们两位是世界上最伟大的文辞家。” “原来是这样。”公爵说，“夫人糊涂了，竟提出这种问题。尽管如此，如果唐吉诃德大人能向我们描述一下杜尔西内亚的情况，我们还是很高兴的。我敢肯定，哪怕您只是大略地描述一下，她也一定漂亮得足以让最美丽的女人嫉妒！” “我怕把她不久前遭受的不幸从我心头抹掉，”唐吉诃德说，“不然我就加以描述了。现在，我更为她难过，而不是描述她。二位大概知道了，前些天我曾想去吻她的手，得到她的祝福，指望她允许我第三次出征，可我碰到的却是一位与我所寻求的杜尔西内亚完全不同的人。她受到魔法的迫害，从贵夫人变成了农妇，从漂亮变成了丑陋，从天使变成了魔鬼，从香气扑鼻变成了臭不可闻，从能言善辩变成了粗俗不堪，从仪态大方变成了十分轻佻，从春风满面变成了愁眉不展，总之一句话，托博索的杜尔西内亚变成了萨亚戈的一个乡下妇女。” “上帝保佑！”公爵喊了一声，说道，“是谁制造了世界上这样大的罪恶？是谁夺走了她的美貌、气质和荣誉？” “谁？”唐吉诃德说，“除了某个出于嫉妒而跟我过不去的恶毒的魔法师，还能有谁呢？这种坏东西生在世上就是为了污蔑诋毁好人的业绩，宣扬他们的丑恶行为。以前有魔法师跟我过不去，现在有魔法师跟我过不去，将来还会有魔法师跟我捣乱，直到把我和我的骑士精神埋葬进被遗忘的深渊。在这方面，他们选择了最能触痛我的方式，因为夺走游侠骑士的情人就好比夺走了他用于观看的眼睛，夺走照亮他的太阳，夺走养活他的食粮。我已多次说过，现在还要再说一遍，没有夫人的游侠骑士就好比没有树叶的大树，没有根基的建筑物，没有形体的荫影。” “说得太对了，”公爵夫人说，“不过，假如我们相信前些天刚刚出版的那本已经受到了普遍欢迎的有关唐吉诃德的小说，假如我没有记错的话，那么，您好像从没见过杜尔西内亚夫人，而且这位夫人压根儿就不存在，她只是您幻想之中的一位夫人，是您在自己的意识里造就了这样一个人物，并且用您所希望的各种美德勾画了她。” “关于这点，我可要说说。”唐吉诃德说，“上帝知道世界上到底有没有杜尔西内亚，她到底是不是虚构的人物，这种事没有必要去追根寻底。并非我无中生有，我确实把她当作一位具有各种美德、足以扬名于世的贵夫人，非常崇拜。她美丽无瑕，端庄而不高傲，多情而不失节，并且由于知恩图报而彬彬有礼，由于彬彬有礼而不失为大家闺秀，总之，正因为她出身豪门，所以才显示出她血统高贵，显示出她远比那些门第卑微的美女更完美。” “是这样，”公爵说，“不过，唐吉诃德大人想必会允许我斗胆告诉您，我读过有关您的那本小说。按照那本小说上写的，就算在托博索或者托搏索之外的什么地方有一位杜尔西内亚，而且她也像您描述得那样美丽可爱，可是若论血统高贵，她恐怕比不上奥里亚娜、阿拉斯特拉哈雷娅、马达西玛和其他此类豪门女子。像这样的豪门女子在骑士小说里比比皆是，这点您很清楚。” “对此我要说，”唐吉诃德说，“杜尔西内亚行如其人，她的道德行为表现了她的血统。一位道德高尚的平民比一位品行低下的贵人更应当受到尊重，况且，杜尔西内亚完全有条件成为头戴王冠、手持权杖的女王呢。一位貌美品端的女子的地位应当奇迹般地提高，即使没有正式提高，也应当从精神上得到承认。” “唐吉诃德大人，”公爵夫人说，“您说起话来真可谓是小心翼翼，就像人们常说的，字斟句酌。我从此相信，必要的话还要让我家里的所有人，包括我的丈夫相信，在托博索有个杜尔西内亚。她依然健在，而且容貌艳丽，出身高贵，值得像唐吉诃德这样的骑士为她效劳。不过，我还有一丝怀疑，并且因此对桑乔产生了一点儿说不出来的反感。我的怀疑就是那本小说里说过，桑乔把您的信送到杜尔西内亚那儿时，她正在筛一口袋麦子，而且说得很明确，是荞麦，这就让人对她的高贵血统产生怀疑了。” 唐吉诃德回答说： “夫人，您大概知道，我遇到的全部或大部分情况都与其他游侠骑士遇到的情况不同，也许这是不可捉摸的命运的安排，也许这是某个嫉贤妒能的魔法师的捉弄。有一点已经得到了证实，那就是所有或大多数著名的游侠骑士都各有所长。他们有的不怕魔法，有的刀枪不入，譬如法国的十二廷臣之一，那个著名的罗尔丹。据说他全身只有左脚板能受到伤害，而且必须用大号针的针尖，其他任何武器都不起作用。所以，贝尔纳多·德尔卡皮奥在龙塞斯瓦列斯杀他的时候，见用铁器奈何不了他，就想起了赫拉克勒斯把据说是大地之子的凶恶巨人安泰举起杀死的办法，用双臂把罗尔丹从地上抱起，扼死了他。 “我说这些话的意思是，我也可能在这些方面有某种才能，不过不是刀枪不入的本领，因为我的经历已多次证明，我皮薄肉嫩，绝非刀枪不入。而且，我也无力抵制住魔法，因为我曾经被关进笼子里。不过，从我那次脱身之后，我相信已经没有任何魔法可以遏制我了。所以，魔法师见他们的恶毒手段对我已经不起作用，就下手害我心爱的人来报复我，想采取虐待杜尔西内亚的办法置我于死地，因为杜尔西内亚就是我的命根子。因此我觉得，当我的侍从为我送信去的时候，他们就把她变成了一个正在干筛麦子之类粗活儿的农妇。不过我已经说过，那麦子绝非荞麦或小麦，而是一颗颗东方明珠。为了证明这点，我可以告诉诸位，前不久我去了一趟托博索，却始终没找到杜尔西内亚的宫殿。第二天，我的侍从看到了她的本来面目，真可谓是世界美女之最；但在我眼里，她却成了一个粗俗丑陋的农妇，本来挺聪明的人，却变得语无伦次。我并没有身中魔法，而且照理我也不可能再中魔法了，所以，只能说是她受到了魔法的侵害，被改变了模样，是我的对手们想以她来报复我。在见到她恢复本来面目之前，我会始终为她哭泣。我说这些，是想让大家不要相信桑乔说的杜尔西内亚筛麦子的事。杜尔西内亚既然可以在我眼里被改变模样，也完全可以在桑乔眼里被改变模样。杜尔西内亚属于托博索的豪门世家，当地有很多这种高贵古老的世家。我相信，杜尔西内亚的家族一定有举足轻重的地位。在未来的几个世纪里，她的家乡一定会以她的名字命名，并且因此而名噪一时，就如同特洛伊以海伦而闻名，西班牙以卡瓦而著称一样，甚至比她们的影响还大得多。 “此外，我还想让公爵夫人知道，桑乔是有史以来游侠骑士最滑稽的侍从，而且有时候，他又傻又聪明，让人在想他到底是傻还是聪明时觉得很有趣。有时他办坏事，人家骂他混蛋；有时他又犯糊涂，人家骂他笨蛋。他怀疑一切，又相信一切。有时我以为他简直愚蠢透了，可后来才发现他真是聪明极了。总之，如果用另外一个侍从来同我换，即使再另加一座城市，我也不换。我现在正在迟疑，把他派到您赐给他的那个岛上去是否合适。至于当总督的能力，我觉得只要指点他一下，他肯定能像其他人一样当好总督。而且，我们多次的经历也证明了，做总督不一定需要很多知识和文化，现在几乎有上百个总督不识字，可是他们却管理得很好。其中的关键就在于，只要他们有良好的意图，又愿意把事情做好，就会有人为他们出主意，告诉他们应该怎样做才好。那些没有文化的优秀总督，就是靠谋士来决断事情的。我只想劝您不要贪不义之财，也不放弃应得之利。还有其他一些小建议，我暂且先留在肚子里不说，到必要的时候再说，这对于您启用桑乔以及他管理岛屿都是有益处的。” 公爵、公爵夫人和唐吉诃德刚说到这儿，忽听得城堡内一片喧闹。只见桑乔惊慌失措地猛然闯了进来，脖子上像戴围嘴儿似的围着一条围裙。他身后跟着很多佣人，更确切地说，是厨房里的杂役和一些工友，其中一个人手里还端着一小盆水。看那水的颜色和浑浊的样子，大概是洗碗水。拿盆的人紧追桑乔，十分热切地要把盆送到桑乔的胡子底下，另外一个杂役看样子是想帮桑乔洗胡子。 “这是干什么，诸位？”公爵夫人问，“这是什么意思？你们想要对这位善良的人干什么？你们怎么不想想，他已经被定为总督了？” 那个要给桑乔洗胡子的杂役说： “这位大人不愿意让我们按照规矩给他洗胡子，而我们的公爵大人和他的东家大人都是这样洗的。 “我愿意洗，”桑乔说，“但是我想用干净点儿的毛巾，更清点儿的水，他们的手也别那么脏。我和我的主人之间不该有这么大的差别，让侍女用香水给他洗，却让这些见鬼的家伙用脏水给我洗。无论是百姓之家还是王宫的习惯，都必须不使人反感才好，更何况这儿的洗胡子习惯简直比鞭子抽还难受。我的胡子挺干净，没必要再这么折腾。谁若是想给我洗，哪怕他只是碰一碰我脑袋上的一根毛，我是说我的胡子，对不起，我就一拳打进他的脑袋。这种怪‘鬼矩’和洗法不像是招待客人，倒像是耍弄客人呢。” 公爵夫人见桑乔气成这个样子，又听他说了这番话，不禁笑了。唐吉诃德见桑乔这副打扮，身上围着斑纹围裙，周围还有一大群厨房的杂役，便有些不高兴。唐吉诃德向公爵和公爵夫人深深鞠了一躬，像是请求他们允许自己讲话，然后就声音平缓地对那些佣人说道： “你们好，小伙子们，请你们放开他吧。你们刚才从哪儿来的，现在请回到哪儿去，或者去你们想去的地方吧。我的侍从现在脸很干净，这套东西只能让他感到难受。听我的话，把他放开吧。他和我都不习惯开玩笑。” 桑乔又接过话来说道： “你们这是拿笨蛋开心！我现在简直是活受罪！你们拿个梳子或者别的什么来，把我的胡子梳一梳，如果能梳出什么不干净的东西，那就给我剃个阴阳头！” 公爵夫人并没有因此而止住笑，她说道： “桑乔说得很有道理，他说什么事儿都有道理。就像他说的，他现在挺干净的，没必要洗，既然他不习惯我们这儿的习惯，就请他自便吧。你们这些人也太不在意，或者说你们太冒失了，对于这样一位人物，对于这样的胡子，你们不用纯金的托盘和洗手盆以及德国毛巾，却把木盆和擦碗用的抹布拿来了。反正一句话，你们是一群没有教养的混蛋。正因为你们是一群坏蛋，才对游侠骑士的侍从不由自主地表现出恶意。” 那些杂役和与他们同来的餐厅侍者以为公爵夫人真是在说他们，便赶紧把围裙从桑乔脖子上拿下来，慌作一团地退了出去，撇下了桑乔。桑乔见自己已经摆脱了他认为是天大的危险，立刻跪到公爵夫人面前，说道： “夫人尊贵，恩德无限。您对我的恩德，我唯有在来世被封为游侠骑士后终生服侍您才能报答。我是个农夫，名叫桑乔·潘萨，已婚，有子女，给人当侍从。如果我有什么能为您效劳的地方，只要您吩咐一声，我俯首听命。” “桑乔，”公爵夫人说，“看来你已经在礼貌中学到了礼貌。我是说，你已经在唐吉诃德大人的熏陶下学会了礼貌，可以说是礼貌的规矩或者如你所说的‘鬼矩’的榜样了。有这样的主人和仆人多好！一位是游侠骑士的北斗，一位是忠实侍从的指南。起来吧，桑乔朋友，对于你的礼貌，我也予以回报。我要敦促公爵大人尽快履行让你做总督的诺言。” 他们的谈话到此结束。唐吉诃德去午休，公爵夫人对桑乔说，如果他不是特别困乏的话，就请他陪同自己和侍女们到一个凉爽的客厅去度过下午。桑乔说，夏季他有每天睡四五个小时午觉的习惯，不过为了给夫人效劳，他宁愿争取全天不睡觉，随时听候夫人的吩咐。说完他便离去了。于是，公爵又吩咐家人怎样按照古代骑士的习惯，把唐吉诃德当作游侠骑士款待好。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4653.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
