{"id":42260,"no":120,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 66","content":"As he left Barcelona, Don Quixote turned gaze upon the spot where he had fallen. “Here Troy was,” said he; “here my ill-luck, not my cowardice, robbed me of all the glory I had won; here Fortune made me the victim of her caprices; here the lustre of my achievements was dimmed; here, in a word, fell my happiness never to rise again.” “Senor,” said Sancho on hearing this, “it is the part of brave hearts to be patient in adversity just as much as to be glad in prosperity; I judge by myself, for, if when I was a governor I was glad, now that I am a squire and on foot I am not sad; and I have heard say that she whom commonly they call Fortune is a drunken whimsical jade, and, what is more, blind, and therefore neither sees what she does, nor knows whom she casts down or whom she sets up.” “Thou art a great philosopher, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “thou speakest very sensibly; I know not who taught thee. But I can tell thee there is no such thing as Fortune in the world, nor does anything which takes place there, be it good or bad, come about by chance, but by the special preordination of heaven; and hence the common saying that ‘each of us is the maker of his own Fortune.’ I have been that of mine; but not with the proper amount of prudence, and my self-confidence has therefore made me pay dearly; for I ought to have reflected that Rocinante’s feeble strength could not resist the mighty bulk of the Knight of the White Moon’s horse. In a word, I ventured it, I did my best, I was overthrown, but though I lost my honour I did not lose nor can I lose the virtue of keeping my word. When I was a knight-errant, daring and valiant, I supported my achievements by hand and deed, and now that I am a humble squire I will support my words by keeping the promise I have given. Forward then, Sancho my friend, let us go to keep the year of the novitiate in our own country, and in that seclusion we shall pick up fresh strength to return to the by me never-forgotten calling of arms.” “Senor,” returned Sancho, “travelling on foot is not such a pleasant thing that it makes me feel disposed or tempted to make long marches. Let us leave this armour hung up on some tree, instead of some one that has been hanged; and then with me on Dapple’s back and my feet off the ground we will arrange the stages as your worship pleases to measure them out; but to suppose that I am going to travel on foot, and make long ones, is to suppose nonsense.” “Thou sayest well, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “let my armour be hung up for a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve on the trees what was inscribed on the trophy of Roland’s armour — “That’s the very thing,” said Sancho; “and if it was not that we should feel the want of Rocinante on the road, it would be as well to leave him hung up too.” “And yet, I had rather not have either him or the armour hung up,” said Don Quixote, “that it may not be said, ‘for good service a bad return.’” “Your worship is right,” said Sancho; “for, as sensible people hold, ‘the fault of the ass must not be laid on the pack-saddle;’ and, as in this affair the fault is your worship’s , punish yourself and don’t let your anger break out against the already battered and bloody armour, or the meekness of Rocinante, or the tenderness of my feet, trying to make them travel more than is reasonable.” In converse of this sort the whole of that day went by, as did the four succeeding ones, without anything occurring to interrupt their journey, but on the fifth as they entered a village they found a great number of people at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday. Upon Don Quixote’s approach a peasant called out, “One of these two gentlemen who come here, and who don’t know the parties, will tell us what we ought to do about our wager.” “That I will, certainly,” said Don Quixote, “and according to the rights of the case, if I can manage to understand it.” “Well, here it is, worthy sir,” said the peasant; “a man of this village who is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged another, a neighbour of his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a race. The agreement was that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces with equal weights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights were to be equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine stone, should put eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the twenty stone of the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.” “Not at all,” exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote could answer; “it’s for me, that only a few days ago left off being a governor and a judge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtful questions and give an opinion in disputes of all sorts.” “Answer in God’s name, Sancho my friend,” said Don Quixote, “for I am not fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so confused and upset.” With this permission Sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered round him, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his, “Brothers, what the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it a shadow of justice in it; because, if it be true, as they say, that the challenged may choose the weapons, the other has no right to choose such as will prevent and keep him from winning. My decision, therefore, is that the fat challenger prune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself, and take eleven stone of his flesh off his body, here or there, as he pleases, and as suits him best; and being in this way reduced to nine stone weight, he will make himself equal and even with nine stone of his opponent, and they will be able to run on equal terms.” “By all that’s good,” said one of the peasants as he heard Sancho’s decision, “but the gentleman has spoken like a saint, and given judgment like a canon! But I’ll be bound the fat man won’t part with an ounce of his flesh, not to say eleven stone.” “The best plan will be for them not to run,” said another, “so that neither the thin man break down under the weight, nor the fat one strip himself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine, and let’s take these gentlemen to the tavern where there’s the best, and ‘over me be the cloak when it rains.” “I thank you, sirs,” said Don Quixote; “but I cannot stop for an instant, for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me to seem discourteous and to travel apace;” and spurring Rocinante he pushed on, leaving them wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his own strange figure and at the shrewdness of his servant, for such they took Sancho to be; and another of them observed, “If the servant is so clever, what must the master be? I’ll bet, if they are going to Salamanca to study, they’ll come to be alcaldes of the Court in a trice; for it’s a mere joke — only to read and read, and have interest and good luck; and before a man knows where he is he finds himself with a staff in his hand or a mitre on his head.” That night master and man passed out in the fields in the open air, and the next day as they were pursuing their journey they saw coming towards them a man on foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin or spiked staff in his hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon as he came close to Don Quixote, increased his pace and half running came up to him, and embracing his right thigh, for he could reach no higher, exclaimed with evident pleasure, “O Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, what happiness it will be to the heart of my lord the duke when he knows your worship is coming back to his castle, for he is still there with my lady the duchess!” “I do not recognise you, friend,” said Don Quixote, “nor do I know who you are, unless you tell me.” “I am Tosilos, my lord the duke’s lacquey, Senor Don Quixote,” replied the courier; “he who refused to fight your worship about marrying the daughter of Dona Rodriguez.” “God bless me!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “is it possible that you are the one whom mine enemies the enchanters changed into the lacquey you speak of in order to rob me of the honour of that battle?” “Nonsense, good sir!” said the messenger; “there was no enchantment or transformation at all; I entered the lists just as much lacquey Tosilos as I came out of them lacquey Tosilos. I thought to marry without fighting, for the girl had taken my fancy; but my scheme had a very different result, for as soon as your worship had left the castle my lord the duke had a hundred strokes of the stick given me for having acted contrary to the orders he gave me before engaging in the combat; and the end of the whole affair is that the girl has become a nun, and Dona Rodriguez has gone back to Castile, and I am now on my way to Barcelona with a packet of letters for the viceroy which my master is sending him. If your worship would like a drop, sound though warm, I have a gourd here full of the best, and some scraps of Tronchon cheese that will serve as a provocative and wakener of your thirst if so be it is asleep.” “I take the offer,” said Sancho; “no more compliments about it; pour out, good Tosilos, in spite of all the enchanters in the Indies.” “Thou art indeed the greatest glutton in the world, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and the greatest booby on earth, not to be able to see that this courier is enchanted and this Tosilos a sham one; stop with him and take thy fill; I will go on slowly and wait for thee to come up with me.” The lacquey laughed, unsheathed his gourd, unwalletted his scraps, and taking out a small loaf of bread he and Sancho seated themselves on the green grass, and in peace and good fellowship finished off the contents of the alforjas down to the bottom, so resolutely that they licked the wrapper of the letters, merely because it smelt of cheese. Said Tosilos to Sancho, “Beyond a doubt, Sancho my friend, this master of thine ought to be a madman.” “Ought!” said Sancho; “he owes no man anything; he pays for everything, particularly when the coin is madness. I see it plain enough, and I tell him so plain enough; but what’s the use? especially now that it is all over with him, for here he is beaten by the Knight of the White Moon.” Tosilos begged him to explain what had happened him, but Sancho replied that it would not be good manners to leave his master waiting for him; and that some other day if they met there would be time enough for that; and then getting up, after shaking his doublet and brushing the crumbs out of his beard, he drove Dapple on before him, and bidding adieu to Tosilos left him and rejoined his master, who was waiting for him under the shade of a tree. 离开巴塞罗那时，唐吉诃德回头看了看他被撞倒的地方，说道： “这里就是特洛伊！并非我的胆怯，而是晦气在这里断送了我已经取得的荣誉。命运在这里捉弄了我，使我的丰功伟绩黯然失色。我的运气在此彻底消失，再也不能复得了！” 桑乔闻言说道： “大人，得意之时不忘形，身处逆境不气馁，才称得上是英雄胆略。我对自己也是这样要求的。我当总督时很高兴，现在是侍从，而且得步行，可我并没有伤心。我听说人们称为命运的那个东西就像个瞎眼醉婆，胡搅蛮干，连她自己也搞不清她究竟推翻了谁，扶植了谁。” “你说得太有道理了，”唐吉诃德说，“你说得太精辟了，我不知道是谁教了你这些东西。我告诉你，世界上根本就不存在什么命运，也没有什么事情是靠命运产生的，不管是好事还是坏事。除非是天意，否则所有的事情都是偶然的。这就是人们常说的‘不信命运信自己’，我就是这样。可是我不够谨慎，而且刚愎自用，所以出了丑。我本应想到白月骑士的马身高体壮，瘦弱的罗西南多抵御不了它。但我毕竟是尽了力。我被撞倒在地，虽然丢了脸，却没有丢掉敢做敢当的美德。我做游侠骑士时勇敢顽强，以我的双手和行动建立了我的业绩。现在我是个落魄的绅士，也一定要遵守诺言，建立我的信誉。开步走吧，桑乔朋友，咱们回家去苦修一年，养精蓄锐，然后再准备重返我念念不忘的武士行当吧。” “大人，”桑乔说，“走路的滋味可不好受，而且也走不远。咱们还是把这盔甲像对待绞刑犯那样挂在树上吧。我骑在我的驴背上，双脚不沾地，您愿意走多远咱们就走多远。要想让我靠脚板走路，而且走得远，那可是根本办不到的。” “说得好，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“你就把我的盔甲当作纪念品挂到树上去，并且在那棵树和周围的树上刻下罗尔丹为它的盔甲镌刻的那句话吧： 不敌罗尔丹， 莫把盔甲犯。” “我觉得您说得好极了。”桑乔说，“若不是因为咱们路上少不了罗西南多，真该把它也挂到树上去。” “说实话，无论是罗西南多还是盔甲，我都不想挂到树上去，”唐吉诃德说，“免得人家说辛劳一场，如此下场。” “您说得很对，”桑乔说，“据聪明人讲，驴的错不赖驮鞍。这件事是您的错，所以应该惩罚您，不该迁怒于已经沾上了血迹的破盔甲和性情温和的罗西南多，更不能怪我的脚板太软，明明走不了那么远的路还非要走。” 他们说着话，一天过去了，以后几天也一路顺利，没有遇到什么事情。第五天，他们在一个村口遇到很多人聚集在一个客店门前。原来是过节，他们正在那儿娱乐消遣。唐吉诃德走近时，一个农夫高声喊道： “来的这两位大人谁都不认识，咱们让他们中的一个人说说咱们打赌的事应该怎么办吧。” “只要我能弄清是怎么回事，”唐吉诃德说，“我一定秉公评判。” “这位好大人，”那个农夫说道，“现在的情况是，有一位村民特别胖，体重为十一阿罗瓦，他要同一位体重不足五阿罗瓦的村民赛跑，条件是同样跑一百步，而且负重也一样。可是当人家问那个胖子，体重不同的问题怎么解决时，他却说让那个体重五阿罗瓦的人再背六阿罗瓦的东西，这样两个人的体重就一样了。” “这就不对了，”不等唐吉诃德答话，桑乔就抢先说道，“大家都知道，前不久我当过总督和判官，这类疑难问题还是让我来判断吧。” “那你就说吧，桑乔朋友，”唐吉诃德说，“我现在糊里糊涂的，脑子很乱。” 很多人张口结舌地围着桑乔，等着他的判断。桑乔说道： “诸位兄弟，这个胖子的要求毫无道理。如果我听说的是真的，那么受到挑战的人应该有权挑选武器，若是只让受挑战的人挑选妨碍自己取胜的武器就不对了。依我之见，提出赛跑的胖子应该去掉多余的体重，不管是切还是削，是割还是剔，也不管是从身体什么部位，反正他觉得合适就行，去掉多出来的那部分肉，只剩下五阿罗瓦，这样体重就和对手一样，可以赛跑了。” “太棒了，”农夫听了桑乔的决断后说，“这位大人果然真知灼见，料事如神。不过我敢肯定，那个胖子连一盎司肉都不会割，就更别说六阿罗瓦了。” “既然瘦子不愿受累，胖子不愿割肉，”另一个农夫说，“那就别赛了。咱们还是拿出一半赌注去喝酒吧。咱们带这两位大人到最好的酒店去，我那份钱呢……到时候再说。” “诸位大人，”唐吉诃德说，“我感谢你们，可是我一刻也不能停留。我现在境遇不好，心绪不佳，恕我失礼了，我得赶紧赶路。” 说完唐吉诃德就催马向前。在场者看到唐吉诃德那副奇怪的模样，又看到他的侍从料事如神，觉得很奇怪。他们觉得桑乔是个精明人。另一个农夫说道： “如果仆人都这么精明，那么他的主人还用说吗？我敢打赌，他们若是再去萨拉曼卡学习学习，转眼之间就可以成为京城的市长。这种事就跟开玩笑似的，上点学，托点儿关系，再碰上好运气，不知什么时候就权杖在手或者戴上主教的冠冕了。” 当天晚上，唐吉诃德和桑乔露宿在野外。第二天他们继续赶路，走到半路，忽见一个人迎面走来，脖子上挎着一个褡裢，手里拿着一杆标枪或者梭标之类的东西，看样子像个步行信使。他走近唐吉诃德时快步抢上前，搮住唐吉诃德的右腿，显出十分高兴的样子说道： “哎呀，我的唐吉诃德大人，我们公爵大人若是知道您要回到他们的城堡去，该有多高兴啊，他和公爵夫人正在城堡里等着您呢！” “我并不认识你呀，朋友，”唐吉诃德说，“如果你不告诉我，我想不起你是谁。” “唐吉诃德大人，”信使答道，“我是公爵的仆人托西洛斯呀。正是我不愿为了同唐娜罗德里格斯的女儿结婚的事同您决斗呀。” “上帝保佑！”唐吉诃德说，“我的对头魔法师为了诋毁我取胜的荣誉，把那个人变成了仆人，而你就是那个人吗？” “别说了，好大人，”信使说道，“根本就没有什么改变模样的事。我上决斗场时是仆人托西洛斯，下场时仍然是仆人托西洛斯。我觉得那个姑娘很漂亮，想娶她，所以就不决斗了。可是，事与愿违。您刚刚走出城堡，公爵大人就让人打了我一百棍子，说我违背了他在决斗前给我的指示。最后的结果是姑娘当了修女，唐娜罗德里格斯回卡斯蒂利亚去了。我现在要去巴塞罗那，主人让我给总督送信去。如果您想喝点儿酒，我带了个酒葫芦，里面装着香醇的上等好酒，而且还有点热乎呢。我还带了一些特龙琼奶酪片可以下酒。您就是睡着了，也能把您馋醒。” “我是来者不拒，”桑乔说，“你把酒分分吧，给我斟点儿酒，好托西洛斯，即使西印度群岛①的所有魔法师都不愿意也没关系。” ①指今日的美洲。 “你真是世界上最大的馋鬼，最大的白痴。”唐吉诃德说，“你竟看不出这是中了魔法的信使，是个假托西洛斯吗？那么你就在这儿和他喝个够吧。我先慢慢向前走，在前面等着你。” 托西洛斯不由得笑了。他打开葫芦，从褡裢里拿出奶酪片，又取出一个小面包，和桑乔一起坐到绿草地上，亲亲热热地把褡裢里的东西吃了个精光。他们吃得特别香，因为信札也沾了点奶酪味，他们还把信札也舔了舔。托西洛斯对桑乔说： “桑乔朋友，你的主人肯定是个疯子。” “怎么会呢？”桑乔说，“他并不欠任何人钱，该付的钱都付了，但他支付的是他的疯癫。这点我看得很清楚，而且也对他说过，可是又起了什么作用呢？况且，现在这种情况已经结束，他被白月骑士打败了。” 托西洛斯请求桑乔给他讲讲是怎么回事，可桑乔说，让主人在前面等着太不礼貌，以后找时间再说吧。说完桑乔抖了抖外衣，擦了擦胡子上的在遄包，又对托西洛斯说了声“再见”，便去追赶唐吉诃德了。唐吉诃德正在一棵树的树荫下等着他呢。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4687.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
