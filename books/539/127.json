{"id":42267,"no":127,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 73","content":"At the entrance of the village, so says Cide Hamete, Don Quixote saw two boys quarrelling on the village threshing-floor one of whom said to the other, “Take it easy, Periquillo; thou shalt never see it again as long as thou livest.” Don Quixote heard this, and said he to Sancho, “Dost thou not mark, friend, what that boy said, ‘Thou shalt never see it again as long as thou livest’?” “Well,” said Sancho, “what does it matter if the boy said so?” “What!” said Don Quixote, “dost thou not see that, applied to the object of my desires, the words mean that I am never to see Dulcinea more?” Sancho was about to answer, when his attention was diverted by seeing a hare come flying across the plain pursued by several greyhounds and sportsmen. In its terror it ran to take shelter and hide itself under Dapple. Sancho caught it alive and presented it to Don Quixote, who was saying, “Malum signum, malum signum! a hare flies, greyhounds chase it, Dulcinea appears not.” “Your worship’s a strange man,” said Sancho; “let’s take it for granted that this hare is Dulcinea, and these greyhounds chasing it the malignant enchanters who turned her into a country wench; she flies, and I catch her and put her into your worship’s hands, and you hold her in your arms and cherish her; what bad sign is that, or what ill omen is there to be found here?” The two boys who had been quarrelling came over to look at the hare, and Sancho asked one of them what their quarrel was about. He was answered by the one who had said, “Thou shalt never see it again as long as thou livest,” that he had taken a cage full of crickets from the other boy, and did not mean to give it back to him as long as he lived. Sancho took out four cuartos from his pocket and gave them to the boy for the cage, which he placed in Don Quixote’s hands, saying, “There, senor! there are the omens broken and destroyed, and they have no more to do with our affairs, to my thinking, fool as I am, than with last year’s clouds; and if I remember rightly I have heard the curate of our village say that it does not become Christians or sensible people to give any heed to these silly things; and even you yourself said the same to me some time ago, telling me that all Christians who minded omens were fools; but there’s no need of making words about it; let us push on and go into our village.” The sportsmen came up and asked for their hare, which Don Quixote gave them. They then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the town they came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy with their breviaries. It should be mentioned that Sancho had thrown, by way of a sumpter-cloth, over Dapple and over the bundle of armour, the buckram robe painted with flames which they had put upon him at the duke’s castle the night Altisidora came back to life. He had also fixed the mitre on Dapple’s head, the oddest transformation and decoration that ever ass in the world underwent. They were at once recognised by both the curate and the bachelor, who came towards them with open arms. Don Quixote dismounted and received them with a close embrace; and the boys, who are lynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass’s mitre and came running to see it, calling out to one another, “Come here, boys, and see Sancho Panza’s ass figged out finer than Mingo, and Don Quixote’s beast leaner than ever.” So at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by the curate and the bachelor, they made their entrance into the town, and proceeded to Don Quixote’s house, at the door of which they found his housekeeper and niece, whom the news of his arrival had already reached. It had been brought to Teresa Panza, Sancho’s wife, as well, and she with her hair all loose and half naked, dragging Sanchica her daughter by the hand, ran out to meet her husband; but seeing him coming in by no means as good case as she thought a governor ought to be, she said to him, “How is it you come this way, husband? It seems to me you come tramping and footsore, and looking more like a disorderly vagabond than a governor.” “Hold your tongue, Teresa,” said Sancho; “often ‘where there are pegs there are no flitches;’ let’s go into the house and there you’ll hear strange things. I bring money, and that’s the main thing, got by my own industry without wronging anybody.” “You bring the money, my good husband,” said Teresa, “and no matter whether it was got this way or that; for, however you may have got it, you’ll not have brought any new practice into the world.” Sanchica embraced her father and asked him if he brought her anything, for she had been looking out for him as for the showers of May; and she taking hold of him by the girdle on one side, and his wife by the hand, while the daughter led Dapple, they made for their house, leaving Don Quixote in his, in the hands of his niece and housekeeper, and in the company of the curate and the bachelor. Don Quixote at once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew in private with the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told them of his defeat, and of the engagement he was under not to quit his village for a year, which he meant to keep to the letter without departing a hair’s breadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound by scrupulous good faith and the laws of knight-errantry; and of how he thought of turning shepherd for that year, and taking his diversion in the solitude of the fields, where he could with perfect freedom give range to his thoughts of love while he followed the virtuous pastoral calling; and he besought them, if they had not a great deal to do and were not prevented by more important business, to consent to be his companions, for he would buy sheep enough to qualify them for shepherds; and the most important point of the whole affair, he could tell them, was settled, for he had given them names that would fit them to a T. The curate asked what they were. Don Quixote replied that he himself was to be called the shepherd Quixotize and the bachelor the shepherd Carrascon, and the curate the shepherd Curambro, and Sancho Panza the shepherd Pancino. Both were astounded at Don Quixote’s new craze; however, lest he should once more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of his chivalry, they trusting that in the course of the year he might be cured, fell in with his new project, applauded his crazy idea as a bright one, and offered to share the life with him. “And what’s more,” said Samson Carrasco, “I am, as all the world knows, a very famous poet, and I’ll be always making verses, pastoral, or courtly, or as it may come into my head, to pass away our time in those secluded regions where we shall be roaming. But what is most needful, sirs, is that each of us should choose the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in his verses, and that we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard, without writing up and carving her name on it, as is the habit and custom of love-smitten shepherds.” “That’s the very thing,” said Don Quixote; “though I am relieved from looking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, for there’s the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the glory of these brooksides, the ornament of these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, the cream of all the graces, and, in a word, the being to whom all praise is appropriate, be it ever so hyperbolical.” “Very true,” said the curate; “but we the others must look about for accommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose one way or another.” “And,” added Samson Carrasco, “if they fail us, we can call them by the names of the ones in print that the world is filled with, Filidas, Amarilises, Dianas, Fleridas, Galateas, Belisardas; for as they sell them in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them our own. If my lady, or I should say my shepherdess, happens to be called Ana, I’ll sing her praises under the name of Anarda, and if Francisca, I’ll call her Francenia, and if Lucia, Lucinda, for it all comes to the same thing; and Sancho Panza, if he joins this fraternity, may glorify his wife Teresa Panza as Teresaina.” Don Quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curate bestowed vast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had made, and again offered to bear him company all the time that he could spare from his imperative duties. And so they took their leave of him, recommending and beseeching him to take care of his health and treat himself to a suitable diet. It so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three of them said; and as soon as they were gone they both of them came in to Don Quixote, and said the niece, “What’s this, uncle? Now that we were thinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a quiet respectable life there, are you going to get into fresh entanglements, and turn ‘young shepherd, thou that comest here, young shepherd going there?’ Nay! indeed ‘the straw is too hard now to make pipes of.’” “And,” added the housekeeper, “will your worship be able to bear, out in the fields, the heats of summer, and the chills of winter, and the howling of the wolves? Not you; for that’s a life and a business for hardy men, bred and seasoned to such work almost from the time they were in swaddling-clothes. Why, to make choice of evils, it’s better to be a knight-errant than a shepherd! Look here, senor; take my advice — and I’m not giving it to you full of bread and wine, but fasting, and with fifty years upon my head — stay at home, look after your affairs, go often to confession, be good to the poor, and upon my soul be it if any evil comes to you.” “Hold your peace, my daughters,” said Don Quixote; “I know very well what my duty is; help me to bed, for I don’t feel very well; and rest assured that, knight-errant now or wandering shepherd to be, I shall never fail to have a care for your interests, as you will see in the end.” And the good wenches (for that they undoubtedly were), the housekeeper and niece, helped him to bed, where they gave him something to eat and made him as comfortable as possible. 锡德·哈迈德说，唐吉诃德进村时，看到两个孩子正在打谷场上吵架。一个孩子说： “你死心吧，佩里吉略，你这辈子别想再看到她了。” 唐吉诃德听见了，问桑乔： “你听见那个孩子的话了吗，朋友？他说：‘你这辈子别想再看到她了。’” “听见了，”桑乔说，“那又有什么关系呢？” “什么关系？”唐吉诃德说，“那句话是冲我说的，意思是说我这辈子别想再看到杜尔西内亚了。” 桑乔刚要说话，忽然看见野地里有一只兔子正向他们跑来，许多猎狗和猎人在后面追赶。兔子吓得东躲西藏，最后窜到了驴肚子下面。桑乔伸手抓住兔子，把它交给了唐吉诃德。唐吉诃德喃喃自语道： “不祥之兆，不祥之兆！猎狗追，兔子跑，杜尔西内亚见不到！” “您真怪，”桑乔说，“就算这只兔子是杜尔西内亚，后面追赶的是把她变成农妇的可恶的魔法师，她不是已经脱身了吗？而且，我又把它抓住交给了您，您正把它抱在怀里抚摸，这里有什么不祥之兆呢？” 两个吵架的孩子也跑来看兔子。桑乔问其中一个孩子刚才为什么吵架。那个说过“你这辈子别想再见到她了”的孩子说，他拿了另外一个孩子的一笼子蟋蟀，打算一辈子不还了。桑乔从衣袋里掏出四文钱，送给那个孩子，向他要过那个笼子，再把它交给唐吉诃德，并且说道： “大人，这样不祥之兆就被打消了。其实，它和咱们的事根本没关系。我虽然笨，可是我知道，这些预兆只是过眼烟云。如果我没记错的话，我记得咱们村的神甫说过，基督徒和聪明人不该注意这些枝节小事。您前几天也对我说过，相信兆头的人都是傻瓜。咱们不值得在这些事情上纠缠，还是进村吧。” 猎人们跑过来要兔子，唐吉诃德把兔子给了他们。两人又往前走，在村口看到神甫和卡拉斯科学士正在一块草地上祈祷。应该说一下，在阿尔蒂西多拉还魂的那天晚上，桑乔曾穿过一件画满火焰的麻布衣服。现在，桑乔却把这件衣服当作盖布盖住了驴和放在驴背上的盔甲，还把那顶纸高帽戴到了驴头上。可以说，世界上从没有驴是这种打扮。神甫和学士马上认出了唐吉诃德和桑乔，张开双臂过来迎接他们。唐吉诃德下了马，紧紧拥抱了神甫和学士。孩子们眼尖，一下子就发现了驴头上的纸高帽，都跑过来看，而且还互相招呼着： “伙伴们，快来看啊，桑乔·潘萨的驴打扮得多么漂亮！ 唐吉诃德的马可是比以前更瘦了。” 唐吉诃德和桑乔在神甫和学士的陪伴下以及孩子们的簇拥下进了村子。他们先来到唐吉诃德家。唐吉诃德的女管家和外甥女听说唐吉诃德要回来了，正在门口等着呢。桑乔的老婆特雷莎·潘萨也听到了消息，披头散发、袒胸露背地拉着女儿桑奇卡跑来找丈夫。她见桑乔没有如她想象的那样像个总督似的穿得衣冠楚楚，便对桑乔说道： “你怎么这个样子呀，我的丈夫？看你像是走回来的，一定把脚走疼了。我看你像个逃难的，哪里像什么总督！” “别说了，特雷莎，”桑乔说，“以为有好事的地方，常常根本就没那么回事。咱们先回家吧，我有好多新鲜事要告诉你呢。我带钱回来了。这是大事。钱是我想法子挣的，谁也没坑。” “别管是怎么挣的，”特雷莎说，“只要带回钱来就行，我的好丈夫。无论怎样挣，你也不会挣出什么新花样。” 桑奇卡抱着父亲，问他为自己带了什么东西，她一直在等着呢。女儿一手抓着桑乔的腰带，一手牵着驴，特雷莎拉着丈夫的手，一起回了家。唐吉诃德家里只剩下唐吉诃德、女管家和外甥女。神甫和学士也留下来陪伴唐吉诃德。 唐吉诃德立刻把学士和神甫拉到一边，简单地介绍了自己如何吃败仗，按讲定的条件得在家里呆一年；他是真正的游侠骑士，决心恪守条件的规定，不越雷池一步。他又说，他打算这一段时间过无忧无虑的牧羊生活，在田野树林里抒发他的情思。他还请求神甫和学士，如果没有其他重大的事情，就来跟他作伴。他要买一大群羊，并且已经为他们取了世界上最有牧歌风味的名字。神甫问他都是什么名字。唐吉诃德说，他本人叫牧羊人吉诃蒂斯，学士叫牧羊人卡拉斯孔，神甫叫牧羊人库里昂布罗，桑乔·潘萨叫牧羊人潘希诺。 神甫和学士眼见他的疯劲又有了新花样，十分吃惊，但是想到这样可以把他留在家乡，并且可望在这一年内治好他那游侠骑士的疯癫，于是就接受了他这种牧羊生涯的痴想，并且表示愿与他共度牧羊生涯。 “大家都知道，”参孙·卡拉斯科说，“我作诗是非常在行的，我可以写好多好多牧歌。咱们在田野里漫游时，可以引吭高歌。不过，先生们，有件事可别忘了：咱们得给自己歌颂的牧羊姑娘选一个名字，这是绝对必要的。还别忘了多情的牧羊人的习惯：不管树有多硬，要在每棵树上都刻上那个牧羊姑娘的名字。” “你讲得太对了，”唐吉诃德答道，“不过，我是不用费神给虚拟的牧羊姑娘找名字了，因为我的心已经被绝代佳人杜尔西内亚占据了。她是河边的光环，草原的花朵，美女的典范，风雅的楷模，总之，对她极尽赞颂也毫不过分。” “是这样，”神甫说，“但我们还得为我们的牧羊姑娘起几个名字，即使没有很合适的，也得找几个差不多的。” 参孙·卡拉斯科说道： “如果没有合适的名字，咱们可以借用书上的。书上有的是，什么菲丽达、阿玛丽丝、迪亚娜丝、弗莱丽达丝、加拉特娅丝、贝丽萨尔达丝等等。这些在市场上就有卖的，咱们买回来就是咱们的。假如我那位夫人，最好说我那位牧羊姑娘，名叫安娜，我就以安娜尔达的名字歌颂她；如果她叫弗朗西丝卡，我就叫她弗朗塞妮亚；她若是叫露西亚，我就叫她露辛达，这就行了。如果桑乔·潘萨愿意加入进来，可以把他老婆特雷莎·潘萨称为特雷萨依娜。” 唐吉诃德听到这些名字，不禁笑了。神甫再次称赞他的决定英明，表示只要不忙就来跟他作伴。然后他们二人告辞，同时还劝他注意保养身体。 女管家和外甥女跟往常一样偷听了他们的谈话。神甫和学士刚走，她们俩就进来找唐吉诃德。外甥女说： “这是怎么回事，舅舅？我们以为您这次回来会老老实实地呆在家里，过点清闲日子呢，可是您又想起了什么馊主意，说什么—— 小牧童你来了， 小牧童你又走了。 老实说吧，您这把年纪，干什么都力不从心了。” 女管家也说道： “大人，旷野里奔波，夏天的烈日，冬天的寒霜，您怎么受得了？还有豺狼的嚎叫哩！老天保佑！大人，您连想也别去想。那行当只配给天生干那活儿的人去干，给健壮如牛的人去干。当游侠骑士纵有千不好，万不好，也比当牧羊人强。说实话，主人，听我的忠告吧。我并不是吃饱了撑得胡乱说，我还在吃斋修身哩。我都五十多了，还是听我的吧：守在家里，照料一下家业，常做忏悔，帮穷人做点好事，要是有什么灾害降临，全由我顶着好了。” 唐吉诃德说：“孩子们，别多说，该干什么我心中有数。我这会儿觉得有点不舒服，你们扶我上床吧。你们放心，不管我当游侠骑士还是当牧羊人，我都会照顾你们，到时你们就知道了。” 外甥女和女管家无疑都是好脾气，她们扶他上了床，给他吃的，精心地照料他睡下。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4694.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
