{"id":42220,"no":80,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 26","content":"All were silent, Tyrians and Trojans; I mean all who were watching the show were hanging on the lips of the interpreter of its wonders, when drums and trumpets were heard to sound inside it and cannon to go off. The noise was soon over, and then the boy lifted up his voice and said, “This true story which is here represented to your worships is taken word for word from the French chronicles and from the Spanish ballads that are in everybody’s mouth, and in the mouth of the boys about the streets. Its subject is the release by Senor Don Gaiferos of his wife Melisendra, when a captive in Spain at the hands of the Moors in the city of Sansuena, for so they called then what is now called Saragossa; and there you may see how Don Gaiferos is playing at the tables, just as they sing it —\\n\\n At tables playing Don Gaiferos sits,\\n\\n For Melisendra is forgotten now.\\n\\n And that personage who appears there with a crown on his head and a sceptre in his hand is the Emperor Charlemagne, the supposed father of Melisendra, who, angered to see his son-in-law’s inaction and unconcern, comes in to chide him; and observe with what vehemence and energy he chides him, so that you would fancy he was going to give him half a dozen raps with his sceptre; and indeed there are authors who say he did give them, and sound ones too; and after having said a great deal to him about imperilling his honour by not effecting the release of his wife, he said, so the tale runs,\\n\\n Enough I’ve said, see to it now.\\n\\n Observe, too, how the emperor turns away, and leaves Don Gaiferos fuming; and you see now how in a burst of anger, he flings the table and the board far from him and calls in haste for his armour, and asks his cousin Don Roland for the loan of his sword, Durindana, and how Don Roland refuses to lend it, offering him his company in the difficult enterprise he is undertaking; but he, in his valour and anger, will not accept it, and says that he alone will suffice to rescue his wife, even though she were imprisoned deep in the centre of the earth, and with this he retires to arm himself and set out on his journey at once. Now let your worships turn your eyes to that tower that appears there, which is supposed to be one of the towers of the alcazar of Saragossa, now called the Aljaferia; that lady who appears on that balcony dressed in Moorish fashion is the peerless Melisendra, for many a time she used to gaze from thence upon the road to France, and seek consolation in her captivity by thinking of Paris and her husband. Observe, too, a new incident which now occurs, such as, perhaps, never was seen. Do you not see that Moor, who silently and stealthily, with his finger on his lip, approaches Melisendra from behind? Observe now how he prints a kiss upon her lips, and what a hurry she is in to spit, and wipe them with the white sleeve of her smock, and how she bewails herself, and tears her fair hair as though it were to blame for the wrong. Observe, too, that the stately Moor who is in that corridor is King Marsilio of Sansuena, who, having seen the Moor’s insolence, at once orders him (though his kinsman and a great favourite of his) to be seized and given two hundred lashes, while carried through the streets of the city according to custom, with criers going before him and officers of justice behind; and here you see them come out to execute the sentence, although the offence has been scarcely committed; for among the Moors there are no indictments nor remands as with us.”\\n\\n Here Don Quixote called out, “Child, child, go straight on with your story, and don’t run into curves and slants, for to establish a fact clearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation;” and said Master Pedro from within, “Boy, stick to your text and do as the gentleman bids you; it’s the best plan; keep to your plain song, and don’t attempt harmonies, for they are apt to break down from being over fine.”\\n\\n “I will,” said the boy, and he went on to say, “This figure that you see here on horseback, covered with a Gascon cloak, is Don Gaiferos himself, whom his wife, now avenged of the insult of the amorous Moor, and taking her stand on the balcony of the tower with a calmer and more tranquil countenance, has perceived without recognising him; and she addresses her husband, supposing him to be some traveller, and holds with him all that conversation and colloquy in the ballad that runs —\\n\\n If you, sir knight, to France are bound,\\n\\n Oh! for Gaiferos ask —\\n\\n which I do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust; suffice it to observe how Don Gaiferos discovers himself, and that by her joyful gestures Melisendra shows us she has recognised him; and what is more, we now see she lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on the haunches of her good husband’s horse. But ah! unhappy lady, the edge of her petticoat has caught on one of the bars of the balcony and she is left hanging in the air, unable to reach the ground. But you see how compassionate heaven sends aid in our sorest need; Don Gaiferos advances, and without minding whether the rich petticoat is torn or not, he seizes her and by force brings her to the ground, and then with one jerk places her on the haunches of his horse, astraddle like a man, and bids her hold on tight and clasp her arms round his neck, crossing them on his breast so as not to fall, for the lady Melisendra was not used to that style of riding. You see, too, how the neighing of the horse shows his satisfaction with the gallant and beautiful burden he bears in his lord and lady. You see how they wheel round and quit the city, and in joy and gladness take the road to Paris. Go in peace, O peerless pair of true lovers! May you reach your longed-for fatherland in safety, and may fortune interpose no impediment to your prosperous journey; may the eyes of your friends and kinsmen behold you enjoying in peace and tranquillity the remaining days of your life — and that they may be as many as those of Nestor!”\\n\\n Here Master Pedro called out again and said, “Simplicity, boy! None of your high flights; all affectation is bad.”\\n\\n The interpreter made no answer, but went on to say, “There was no want of idle eyes, that see everything, to see Melisendra come down and mount, and word was brought to King Marsilio, who at once gave orders to sound the alarm; and see what a stir there is, and how the city is drowned with the sound of the bells pealing in the towers of all the mosques.”\\n\\n “Nay, nay,” said Don Quixote at this; “on that point of the bells Master Pedro is very inaccurate, for bells are not in use among the Moors; only kettledrums, and a kind of small trumpet somewhat like our clarion; to ring bells this way in Sansuena is unquestionably a great absurdity.”\\n\\n On hearing this, Master Pedro stopped ringing, and said, “Don’t look into trifles, Senor Don Quixote, or want to have things up to a pitch of perfection that is out of reach. Are there not almost every day a thousand comedies represented all round us full of thousands of inaccuracies and absurdities, and, for all that, they have a successful run, and are listened to not only with applause, but with admiration and all the rest of it? Go on, boy, and don’t mind; for so long as I fill my pouch, no matter if I show as many inaccuracies as there are motes in a sunbeam.”\\n\\n “True enough,” said Don Quixote; and the boy went on: “See what a numerous and glittering crowd of horsemen issues from the city in pursuit of the two faithful lovers, what a blowing of trumpets there is, what sounding of horns, what beating of drums and tabors; I fear me they will overtake them and bring them back tied to the tail of their own horse, which would be a dreadful sight.”\\n\\n \\n\\n Don Quixote, however, seeing such a swarm of Moors and hearing such a din, thought it would be right to aid the fugitives, and standing up he exclaimed in a loud voice, “Never, while I live, will I permit foul play to be practised in my presence on such a famous knight and fearless lover as Don Gaiferos. Halt! ill-born rabble, follow him not nor pursue him, or ye will have to reckon with me in battle!” and suiting the action to the word, he drew his sword, and with one bound placed himself close to the show, and with unexampled rapidity and fury began to shower down blows on the puppet troop of Moors, knocking over some, decapitating others, maiming this one and demolishing that; and among many more he delivered one down stroke which, if Master Pedro had not ducked, made himself small, and got out of the way, would have sliced off his head as easily as if it had been made of almond-paste. Master Pedro kept shouting, “Hold hard! Senor Don Quixote! can’t you see they’re not real Moors you’re knocking down and killing and destroying, but only little pasteboard figures! Look — sinner that I am! — how you’re wrecking and ruining all that I’m worth!” But in spite of this, Don Quixote did not leave off discharging a continuous rain of cuts, slashes, downstrokes, and backstrokes, and at length, in less than the space of two credos, he brought the whole show to the ground, with all its fittings and figures shivered and knocked to pieces, King Marsilio badly wounded, and the Emperor Charlemagne with his crown and head split in two. The whole audience was thrown into confusion, the ape fled to the roof of the inn, the cousin was frightened, and even Sancho Panza himself was in mighty fear, for, as he swore after the storm was over, he had never seen his master in such a furious passion.\\n\\n The complete destruction of the show being thus accomplished, Don Quixote became a little calmer, said, “I wish I had here before me now all those who do not or will not believe how useful knights-errant are in the world; just think, if I had not been here present, what would have become of the brave Don Gaiferos and the fair Melisendra! Depend upon it, by this time those dogs would have overtaken them and inflicted some outrage upon them. So, then, long live knight-errantry beyond everything living on earth this day!”\\n\\n “Let it live, and welcome,” said Master Pedro at this in a feeble voice, “and let me die, for I am so unfortunate that I can say with King Don Rodrigo —\\n\\n Yesterday was I lord of Spain\\n\\n To-day I’ve not a turret left\\n\\n That I may call mine own.\\n\\n Not half an hour, nay, barely a minute ago, I saw myself lord of kings and emperors, with my stables filled with countless horses, and my trunks and bags with gay dresses unnumbered; and now I find myself ruined and laid low, destitute and a beggar, and above all without my ape, for, by my faith, my teeth will have to sweat for it before I have him caught; and all through the reckless fury of sir knight here, who, they say, protects the fatherless, and rights wrongs, and does other charitable deeds; but whose generous intentions have been found wanting in my case only, blessed and praised be the highest heavens! Verily, knight of the rueful figure he must be to have disfigured mine.”\\n\\n Sancho Panza was touched by Master Pedro’s words, and said to him, “Don’t weep and lament, Master Pedro; you break my heart; let me tell you my master, Don Quixote, is so catholic and scrupulous a Christian that, if he can make out that he has done you any wrong, he will own it, and be willing to pay for it and make it good, and something over and above.”\\n\\n “Only let Senor Don Quixote pay me for some part of the work he has destroyed,” said Master Pedro, “and I would be content, and his worship would ease his conscience, for he cannot be saved who keeps what is another’s against the owner’s will, and makes no restitution.”\\n\\n “That is true,” said Don Quixote; “but at present I am not aware that I have got anything of yours, Master Pedro.”\\n\\n “What!” returned Master Pedro; “and these relics lying here on the bare hard ground — what scattered and shattered them but the invincible strength of that mighty arm? And whose were the bodies they belonged to but mine? And what did I get my living by but by them?”\\n\\n “Now am I fully convinced,” said Don Quixote, “of what I had many a time before believed; that the enchanters who persecute me do nothing more than put figures like these before my eyes, and then change and turn them into what they please. In truth and earnest, I assure you gentlemen who now hear me, that to me everything that has taken place here seemed to take place literally, that Melisendra was Melisendra, Don Gaiferos Don Gaiferos, Marsilio Marsilio, and Charlemagne Charlemagne. That was why my anger was roused; and to be faithful to my calling as a knight-errant I sought to give aid and protection to those who fled, and with this good intention I did what you have seen. If the result has been the opposite of what I intended, it is no fault of mine, but of those wicked beings that persecute me; but, for all that, I am willing to condemn myself in costs for this error of mine, though it did not proceed from malice; let Master Pedro see what he wants for the spoiled figures, for I agree to pay it at once in good and current money of Castile.”\\n\\n Master Pedro made him a bow, saying, “I expected no less of the rare Christianity of the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, true helper and protector of all destitute and needy vagabonds; master landlord here and the great Sancho Panza shall be the arbitrators and appraisers between your worship and me of what these dilapidated figures are worth or may be worth.”\\n\\n The landlord and Sancho consented, and then Master Pedro picked up from the ground King Marsilio of Saragossa with his head off, and said, “Here you see how impossible it is to restore this king to his former state, so I think, saving your better judgments, that for his death, decease, and demise, four reals and a half may be given me.”\\n\\n “Proceed,” said Don Quixote.\\n\\n “Well then, for this cleavage from top to bottom,” continued Master Pedro, taking up the split Emperor Charlemagne, “it would not be much if I were to ask five reals and a quarter.”\\n\\n “It’s not little,” said Sancho.\\n\\n “Nor is it much,” said the landlord; “make it even, and say five reals.”\\n\\n “Let him have the whole five and a quarter,” said Don Quixote; “for the sum total of this notable disaster does not stand on a quarter more or less; and make an end of it quickly, Master Pedro, for it’s getting on to supper-time, and I have some hints of hunger.”\\n\\n “For this figure,” said Master Pedro, “that is without a nose, and wants an eye, and is the fair Melisendra, I ask, and I am reasonable in my charge, two reals and twelve maravedis.”\\n\\n “The very devil must be in it,” said Don Quixote, “if Melisendra and her husband are not by this time at least on the French border, for the horse they rode on seemed to me to fly rather than gallop; so you needn’t try to sell me the cat for the hare, showing me here a noseless Melisendra when she is now, may be, enjoying herself at her ease with her husband in France. God help every one to his own, Master Pedro, and let us all proceed fairly and honestly; and now go on.”\\n\\n Master Pedro, perceiving that Don Quixote was beginning to wander, and return to his original fancy, was not disposed to let him escape, so he said to him, “This cannot be Melisendra, but must be one of the damsels that waited on her; so if I’m given sixty maravedis for her, I’ll be content and sufficiently paid.”\\n\\n And so he went on, putting values on ever so many more smashed figures, which, after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfaction of both parties, came to forty reals and three-quarters; and over and above this sum, which Sancho at once disbursed, Master Pedro asked for two reals for his trouble in catching the ape.\\n\\n “Let him have them, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “not to catch the ape, but to get drunk; and two hundred would I give this minute for the good news, to anyone who could tell me positively, that the lady Dona Melisandra and Senor Don Gaiferos were now in France and with their own people.”\\n\\n “No one could tell us that better than my ape,” said Master Pedro; “but there’s no devil that could catch him now; I suspect, however, that affection and hunger will drive him to come looking for me to-night; but to-morrow will soon be here and we shall see.”\\n\\n In short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace and good fellowship at Don Quixote’s expense, for he was the height of generosity. Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds took his departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page came to bid Don Quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latter resuming his journey, towards which, to help him, Don Quixote gave him twelve reals. Master Pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver with Don Quixote, whom he knew right well; so he rose before the sun, and having got together the remains of his show and caught his ape, he too went off to seek his adventures. The landlord, who did not know Don Quixote, was as much astonished at his mad freaks as at his generosity. To conclude, Sancho, by his master’s orders, paid him very liberally, and taking leave of him they quitted the inn at about eight in the morning and took to the road, where we will leave them to pursue their journey, for this is necessary in order to allow certain other matters to be set forth, which are required to clear up this famous history.\\n\\n \\n\\n 全场鸦雀无声，所有人都全神贯注地看着台上，仔细听讲解员讲解。只听一阵铜鼓和喇叭响，接着是一阵炮声。随后，讲解的小伙子提高了嗓门：\\n\\n “现在，在你们面前表演的是根据法国编年史和西班牙街头流传的民谣编写的一个真实故事。其内容是唐盖费罗斯大人解救他的夫人梅丽森德拉的故事。梅丽森德拉被摩尔人关在西班牙当时叫做桑苏埃尼亚的城里，也就是现在的萨拉戈萨。你们看，唐盖费罗斯正在玩十五子棋，就像歌词唱的：\\n\\n 唐盖费罗斯正在玩十五子棋，\\n\\n 救梅丽森德拉的事已被忘记。\\n\\n “那个头戴皇冠、手拿权杖的人就是梅丽森德拉的继父卡洛马尼奥皇帝。他见女婿如此游手好闲非常恼火，过来责备女婿。他责备得非常严厉，似乎恨不得用权杖打女婿十几下，甚至有人说他真的动手打了，而且打得很重。他还说了唐盖费罗斯如果不设法救出自己的妻子，就会名誉扫地等等诸如此类的话。他说：\\n\\n 我已经说够了，你看着办吧！\\n\\n “你们看，皇帝转过身去，只剩下唐盖费罗斯还在那里生气。他离开了棋盘和棋子，让人给他马上拿盔甲来，又向他的兄弟罗尔丹借杜林达纳宝剑。罗尔丹不愿意借剑给他，却愿意陪同他去完成这个艰巨的任务。可是这位怒气冲天的英雄不同意，说单枪匹马就足以救出自己的妻子，哪怕妻子被藏在地下最深处。就这样，他全身披挂上路了。现在，请诸位掉过头来看那座塔楼。假设那是萨拉戈萨王宫，即现在叫阿尔哈费里亚王宫的一座瞭望塔。瞭望塔上那位穿着摩尔人服装的夫人就是举世无双的梅丽森德拉。她多次从这里遥望通向法国的道路，想念着巴黎和她的丈夫，聊以自慰。你们看，现在出现了一个你们或许再也见不到的场面。你们看见了吗？那个摩尔人把手指放在嘴边上，轻手轻脚地走到了梅丽森德拉背后？你们看，他在梅丽森德拉的嘴唇上吻了一下，而梅丽森德拉迅速地用自己的白衣袖擦嘴，伤心不已难过得直揪自己秀丽的头发，仿佛是她的头发造成了罪孽。你们看，走廊里那个表情严肃的摩尔人就是桑苏埃尼亚的马尔西利奥皇帝。皇帝看见了那个摩尔人的无礼行为，尽管那个摩尔人是他的亲戚，又是他的心腹，他还是下令把那个摩尔人抓起来，抽二百鞭，并且带到城里那个摩尔人常去的街上去游街示众：\\n\\n 叫喊者在前，\\n\\n 押解者在后。\\n\\n 你们看，那个摩尔人马上就要受到惩罚了，尽管他的罪恶企图并没有得逞。摩尔人不像我们，没有什么‘缓期执行，以观后效’。”\\n\\n “孩子，孩子，”唐吉诃德这时候大声说道，“你有话直说，不要拐弯抹角的。要搞清一件事情，必须有很多的、充足的证据。”\\n\\n 佩德罗师傅也在台里说道：\\n\\n “孩子，你别说得太离谱，最好是按照那位大人的吩咐去做。你继续讲下去，是怎样就怎样，不要冷嘲热讽的，否则很容易不攻自破。”\\n\\n “我一定照办，”那个孩子说，“这个骑着马、身披加斯科尼斗篷的人就是唐盖费罗斯。他的妻子现在也在这里。她对那个胆大妄为的摩尔色鬼的愤恨已经解除，现在平静多了。她站在塔楼的瞭望台上同自己的丈夫说话。不过，她并没有认出自己的丈夫来，还以为那是某位过路人呢。她同这位所谓过路人的对话，民谣里是这样说的：\\n\\n 勇士，如果你到法国去，\\n\\n 请去找唐盖费罗斯。\\n\\n “她的其他话我就不说了，罗罗嗦嗦常会使人生厌。现在只说唐盖费罗斯拿掉了斗篷，再看梅丽森德拉那高兴的样子，就可以知道她已经认出了自己的丈夫。我们可以看到她如何从瞭望台上下来，打算骑到丈夫的马屁股上。可是真不巧，她裙子的一角被瞭望台的铁栏杆挂住了，结果被悬空吊在了瞭望台上。\\n\\n “你们再看，仁慈的老天总是在关键时刻解救危难。唐盖费罗斯奔驰而至，他不管梅丽森德拉贵重的裙子是否会被挂破，抓住她，硬把她拽了下来，然后一扭身把她放到马屁股上，让她像男人那样骑在马上，等她坐稳又叫她从背后搂住自己的胸，以免掉下去，因为梅丽森德拉夫人不习惯以这种方式骑马。你们看，骏马嘶鸣，表示它很高兴驮着勇敢的男主人和美丽的女主人。你们看，他们两个人转身出了城，兴奋不已地踏上了通往巴黎的路途。祝你们一路平安，你们这一对天下无比的真正有情人！祝你们安然无恙地回到渴望已久的祖国，一路顺风，畅通无阻！你们的朋友和亲戚正注视着你们，祝你们安度余生！”\\n\\n 此时，佩德罗师傅又提高了嗓门说道：\\n\\n “说得痛快点儿，孩子，别支支吾吾的，各种形式的矫揉造作都不好。”\\n\\n 讲解员没有答话，只是继续说道：\\n\\n “总有些游手好闲的人到处乱踅摸。他们看见梅丽森德拉从瞭望台上下来，上了唐盖费罗斯的马，就去向马尔西利奥皇帝报告。皇帝立即下令拿起武器追赶，你们看，他们的动作有多快。全城响遍了钟声，所有寺院的钟都敲响了。”\\n\\n “这就错了，”唐吉诃德说，“在敲钟这个问题上，佩德罗师傅是大错特错了。摩尔人不敲钟，只敲铜鼓，还吹一种类似笛号的六孔竖笛。要说在桑苏埃尼亚敲钟，那简直是弥天大谎。”\\n\\n 佩德罗师傅闻言停止了表演，说道：\\n\\n “您不要吹毛求疵，唐吉诃德大人，什么事也不要过分认真。现在上演的上千部滑稽戏，难道不都是一派胡言吗？虽然是一派胡言，可还是照演不误，不仅得到了掌声，而且得到了赞扬，得到了一切。只要能塞满我的钱包，孩子，即使戏里的错误多如牛毛，你也接着往下说！”\\n\\n “这才是实话。”唐吉诃德说。\\n\\n 那孩子又说道：\\n\\n “你们看，有多少骑兵出城追赶这对天主教情人啊！无数只小喇叭吹响了，无数只竖笛吹响了，无数只铜鼓敲响了。我真怕他们被抓住。如果他们被抓住，就要被拴在那匹马的尾巴上拖回来，那场面可就惨了。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德看到这么多摩尔人追赶，又听到这样惊天动地的声音，觉得他应该帮助那两个正在逃跑的人。于是他站起来，大声说道：\\n\\n “只要我还在，我绝不允许在我面前对这样一位著名的骑士，对勇敢而又多情的唐盖费罗斯进行污辱！站住，你这无耻的混蛋！不许再追，否则我就要动手了！”\\n\\n 说做就做，唐吉诃德拔出剑，一跃跳到戏台旁，雨点般地急速砍向那些木偶摩尔人，结果有的被打倒了，有的被砍掉了脑袋，有的缺胳膊断腿，有的成了碎块。混乱之中，有一剑猛劈下来，若不是佩德罗师傅蹲身躲避，他的脑袋肯定像切面团一样被砍掉了。佩德罗师傅喊道：\\n\\n “快住手，唐吉诃德大人，您看看，您砍倒、打翻、杀死的摩尔人都不是真人，只是小泥人呀！我真是自作自受！把我的东西全毁了，我的家产全完了。”\\n\\n 不过，唐吉诃德并没有因此就停止砍杀。他双手持剑，连连砍杀，挥剑如雨，不一会儿工夫，戏台就塌了，所有的道具和木偶都变成了碎片。马尔西利奥国王受了重伤，卡洛马尼奥皇帝的脑袋和皇冠分了家。观众大乱，猴子从客店的房顶逃跑了，小伙子吓坏了，那个青年也非常害怕，连桑乔都惊恐不已，事过之后他曾发誓说，他从没见过主人如此狂怒。\\n\\n 把戏台全部砸坏之后，唐吉诃德才安静些了。他说道：\\n\\n “我想让所有那些不相信或者不愿意相信的人都来看看，游侠骑士对于世界是多么有益。假如没有我在这里，善良的唐盖费罗斯和美丽的梅丽森德拉会怎么样呢？他们肯定会被那些坏蛋赶上，遭到不测。一句话，游侠骑士道应当比世界上的所有一切都更永久地存在下去！”\\n\\n “让骑士道永久地存在下去！”佩德罗师傅这时有气无力地说道，“还不如让我去死吧！我真是倒霉透了，就像唐罗德里戈国王说的：\\n\\n 昨日我是西班牙的主人，\\n\\n 今天我却不能说\\n\\n 我身有分文。\\n\\n 半小时前，或者连半小时的一半时间都不到，我还拥有国王和皇帝，马厩里有许多马，箱子和口袋里有许多华丽的衣服。可现在，只剩下一堆破烂，我成了个穷光蛋。特别是我的猴子也没有了，看来要找回来，得费不少劲呢。这都怪这位不分青红皂白的骑士大人。据说他抑强扶弱，做了许多好事，怎么偏偏对我就不那么宽容呢！求高高在上的老天行行好吧，这位猥獕骑士这回可把我弄得真够猥獕的。”\\n\\n 桑乔听了佩德罗师傅的话不禁动了恻隐之心，说道：\\n\\n “别伤心，佩德罗师傅，你也别叹气，我听了心里难受。我可以告诉你，我的主人唐吉诃德是个虔诚的教徒，十足的基督教徒。当他意识到他做了错事时，就会向你承认错误，赔偿你的损失，而且条件会优厚得多。”\\n\\n “如果你的主人能够对他给我造成的损失赔偿一部分，我就知足了，那么他也可以心安理得。要是谁损坏了别人的东西又不赔偿，他的灵魂就升不了天。”\\n\\n “是这样。”唐吉诃德说，“不过，我到现在仍不明白，我和您有什么关系，佩德罗师傅。”\\n\\n “怎么没关系？”佩德罗师傅说，“这满地七零八落的东西，是谁把它们打碎的，弄得遍地都是？难道不是您的不可战胜的有力臂膀吗？这些乱七八糟的东西是您的吗？难道不是我的吗？我靠什么过日子，难道不是靠这些东西吗？”\\n\\n “现在我才明白，”唐吉诃德说，“同前几次的情况一样，那些跟我过不去的魔法师先是让这些人物按照他们的本来面目在我面前出现，然后又改变了它们的模样。诸位正在听我说话的先生们，我实话对你们说，我刚才看到的都是千真万确的，梅丽森德拉就是梅丽森德拉，唐盖费罗斯就是唐盖费罗斯，马尔西利奥就是马尔西利奥，卡洛马尼奥就是卡洛马尼奥，所以我才怒从心头起。我要履行我游侠骑士的义务，我要帮助那两个被追赶的人，出于这一番好意，我才做了我刚才做过的事情。如果事与愿违，那并非我的过错，而是那些跟我过不去的坏人的过错。不过，既然我有错，尽管并非我有意铸成，我还是愿意主动受罚。佩德罗师傅，您看看这些被打坏的木偶一共需要赔多少钱，我一定用西班牙现行金币赔偿你。”\\n\\n 佩德罗师傅对唐吉诃德鞠了一躬，说道：\\n\\n “我没想到，曼查英勇的唐吉诃德，穷苦弱者的真正恩人和保护人，竟会有如此空前的仁爱品德。至于这些被打碎的木偶到底值多少钱，就请店主大人和桑乔大哥做你我之间的公断人吧。”\\n\\n 店主和桑乔同意做公断人。于是，佩德罗师傅从地上拾起没有脑袋的萨拉戈萨国王马尔西利奥，说道：\\n\\n “很明显，已经不可能把这个国王修复如初了。除非有什么更好的办法，否则我认为他已经死了，所以，怎么也得赔我四个半雷阿尔。”\\n\\n “可以。”唐吉诃德说。\\n\\n “这个已经被从上到下劈开了，”佩德罗师傅又拿起被劈开的卡洛马尼奥皇帝说，“所以，要四个雷阿尔加一个夸尔蒂约①并不算多。”\\n\\n “也不少。”桑乔说。\\n\\n “不算多，”店主说，“干脆凑个整数，就算五个雷阿尔吧。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德说：“那就给五个雷阿尔加一个夸尔蒂约吧。损失这么大，我不在乎这一个夸尔蒂约。快点儿吧，佩德罗师傅，该吃晚饭了，我已经有点饿了。”\\n\\n “这个没了鼻子又少了一只眼的木偶是美女梅丽森德拉。\\n\\n 我也不多要，就要两个雷阿尔加十二个马拉维迪②。”\\n\\n ①古币名，一夸尔蒂约相当于四分一雷阿尔。\\n\\n ②古币名，一个雷阿尔兑换三十四个马拉维迪。\\n\\n “这就有点儿见鬼了，”唐吉诃德说，“因为梅丽森德拉和她的丈夫如果一路顺风，现在至少已进入法国享清福了。我觉得他们的马不是在跑，简直是在飞。所以你也别以次充好，拿别的木偶来冒充没鼻子的梅丽森德拉。上帝会保佑各方，佩德罗师傅，咱们还是都踏踏实实地过好自己的日子吧。您再接着说。”\\n\\n 佩德罗师傅见唐吉诃德又开始犯糊涂，就像刚才那样，生怕他又赖账，就说道：\\n\\n “这个大概不是梅丽森德拉，而是她的侍女。那么，您赔我六十个马拉维迪，我就知足了。”\\n\\n 就这样，两人又一一讨论了其他被损木偶的价钱，再由两个公断人裁决，让双方都满意。赔款总数为四十雷阿尔零三个夸尔蒂约。桑乔付了钱。佩德罗师傅又要两个雷阿尔作为找猴子的劳务费。\\n\\n “给他两个雷阿尔，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“不过不是找猴子，而是找消息。如果谁现在能够确切地告诉我，梅丽森德拉夫人和唐盖费罗斯大人已经回到了法国，并且已经与家人团聚，我就给他二百个雷阿尔作为奖励。”\\n\\n “谁也比不上我的猴子说得更准确，”佩德罗师傅说，“可即使是魔鬼这会儿也找不到它。不过我觉得，无论是由于感情还是由于饥饿，它今天晚上都得回来找我，至于结果如何，只能明天见分晓了。”\\n\\n 戏台风波终于平息，大家一起客客气气地吃晚饭，唐吉诃德也显得格外慷慨，支付了晚餐的全部费用。\\n\\n 运送长矛和戟的人天亮之前就走了。天亮以后，小伙子和那个青年人也来向唐吉诃德告别，一个要回到家乡去，一个要继续赶路。唐吉诃德给了继续赶路的青年人十二个雷阿尔作为资助，佩德罗师傅已经很了解唐吉诃德，不愿意再和他纠缠，所以在凌晨太阳出来之前便收拾好自己那些被打坏的道具，带着自己的猴子，去寻找自己的运气了。店主并不了解唐吉诃德，所以对唐吉诃德的疯癫和慷慨感到十分惊奇。桑乔按照主人的吩咐非常大方地付了店钱。八点左右，唐吉诃德和桑乔离开客店上了路。且让他们走吧，咱们可以抽空把一些跟这部著名小说有关的情况介绍一下。\\n\\n
