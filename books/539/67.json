{"id":42207,"no":67,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 13","content":"The knights and the squires made two parties, these telling the story of their lives, the others the story of their loves; but the history relates first of all the conversation of the servants, and afterwards takes up that of the masters; and it says that, withdrawing a little from the others, he of the Grove said to Sancho, “A hard life it is we lead and live, senor, we that are squires to knights-errant; verily, we eat our bread in the sweat of our faces, which is one of the curses God laid on our first parents.” “It may be said, too,” added Sancho, “that we eat it in the chill of our bodies; for who gets more heat and cold than the miserable squires of knight-errantry? Even so it would not be so bad if we had something to eat, for woes are lighter if there’s bread; but sometimes we go a day or two without breaking our fast, except with the wind that blows.” “All that,” said he of the Grove, “may be endured and put up with when we have hopes of reward; for, unless the knight-errant he serves is excessively unlucky, after a few turns the squire will at least find himself rewarded with a fine government of some island or some fair county.” “I,” said Sancho, “have already told my master that I shall be content with the government of some island, and he is so noble and generous that he has promised it to me ever so many times.” “I,” said he of the Grove, “shall be satisfied with a canonry for my services, and my master has already assigned me one.” “Your master,” said Sancho, “no doubt is a knight in the Church line, and can bestow rewards of that sort on his good squire; but mine is only a layman; though I remember some clever, but, to my mind, designing people, strove to persuade him to try and become an archbishop. He, however, would not be anything but an emperor; but I was trembling all the time lest he should take a fancy to go into the Church, not finding myself fit to hold office in it; for I may tell you, though I seem a man, I am no better than a beast for the Church.” “Well, then, you are wrong there,” said he of the Grove; “for those island governments are not all satisfactory; some are awkward, some are poor, some are dull, and, in short, the highest and choicest brings with it a heavy burden of cares and troubles which the unhappy wight to whose lot it has fallen bears upon his shoulders. Far better would it be for us who have adopted this accursed service to go back to our own houses, and there employ ourselves in pleasanter occupations — in hunting or fishing, for instance; for what squire in the world is there so poor as not to have a hack and a couple of greyhounds and a fishingrod to amuse himself with in his own village?” “I am not in want of any of those things,” said Sancho; “to be sure I have no hack, but I have an ass that is worth my master’s horse twice over; God send me a bad Easter, and that the next one I am to see, if I would swap, even if I got four bushels of barley to boot. You will laugh at the value I put on my Dapple — for dapple is the colour of my beast. As to greyhounds, I can’t want for them, for there are enough and to spare in my town; and, moreover, there is more pleasure in sport when it is at other people’s expense.” “In truth and earnest, sir squire,” said he of the Grove, “I have made up my mind and determined to have done with these drunken vagaries of these knights, and go back to my village, and bring up my children; for I have three, like three Oriental pearls.” “I have two,” said Sancho, “that might be presented before the Pope himself, especially a girl whom I am breeding up for a countess, please God, though in spite of her mother.” “And how old is this lady that is being bred up for a countess?” asked he of the Grove. “Fifteen, a couple of years more or less,” answered Sancho; “but she is as tall as a lance, and as fresh as an April morning, and as strong as a porter.” “Those are gifts to fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph of the greenwood,” said he of the Grove; “whoreson strumpet! what pith the rogue must have!” To which Sancho made answer, somewhat sulkily, “She’s no strumpet, nor was her mother, nor will either of them be, please God, while I live; speak more civilly; for one bred up among knights-errant, who are courtesy itself, your words don’t seem to me to be very becoming.” “O how little you know about compliments, sir squire,” returned he of the Grove. “What! don’t you know that when a horseman delivers a good lance thrust at the bull in the plaza, or when anyone does anything very well, the people are wont to say, ‘Ha, whoreson rip! how well he has done it!’ and that what seems to be abuse in the expression is high praise? Disown sons and daughters, senor, who don’t do what deserves that compliments of this sort should be paid to their parents.” “I do disown them,” replied Sancho, “and in this way, and by the same reasoning, you might call me and my children and my wife all the strumpets in the world, for all they do and say is of a kind that in the highest degree deserves the same praise; and to see them again I pray God to deliver me from mortal sin, or, what comes to the same thing, to deliver me from this perilous calling of squire into which I have fallen a second time, decayed and beguiled by a purse with a hundred ducats that I found one day in the heart of the Sierra Morena; and the devil is always putting a bag full of doubloons before my eyes, here, there, everywhere, until I fancy at every stop I am putting my hand on it, and hugging it, and carrying it home with me, and making investments, and getting interest, and living like a prince; and so long as I think of this I make light of all the hardships I endure with this simpleton of a master of mine, who, I well know, is more of a madman than a knight.” “There’s why they say that ‘covetousness bursts the bag,’” said he of the Grove; “but if you come to talk of that sort, there is not a greater one in the world than my master, for he is one of those of whom they say, ‘the cares of others kill the ass;’ for, in order that another knight may recover the senses he has lost, he makes a madman of himself and goes looking for what, when found, may, for all I know, fly in his own face.” “And is he in love perchance?” asked Sancho. “He is,” said of the Grove, “with one Casildea de Vandalia, the rawest and best roasted lady the whole world could produce; but that rawness is not the only foot he limps on, for he has greater schemes rumbling in his bowels, as will be seen before many hours are over.” “There’s no road so smooth but it has some hole or hindrance in it,” said Sancho; “in other houses they cook beans, but in mine it’s by the potful; madness will have more followers and hangers-on than sound sense; but if there be any truth in the common saying, that to have companions in trouble gives some relief, I may take consolation from you, inasmuch as you serve a master as crazy as my own.” “Crazy but valiant,” replied he of the Grove, “and more roguish than crazy or valiant.” “Mine is not that,” said Sancho; “I mean he has nothing of the rogue in him; on the contrary, he has the soul of a pitcher; he has no thought of doing harm to anyone, only good to all, nor has he any malice whatever in him; a child might persuade him that it is night at noonday; and for this simplicity I love him as the core of my heart, and I can’t bring myself to leave him, let him do ever such foolish things.” “For all that, brother and senor,” said he of the Grove, “if the blind lead the blind, both are in danger of falling into the pit. It is better for us to beat a quiet retreat and get back to our own quarters; for those who seek adventures don’t always find good ones.” Sancho kept spitting from time to time, and his spittle seemed somewhat ropy and dry, observing which the compassionate squire of the Grove said, “It seems to me that with all this talk of ours our tongues are sticking to the roofs of our mouths; but I have a pretty good loosener hanging from the saddle-bow of my horse,” and getting up he came back the next minute with a large bota of wine and a pasty half a yard across; and this is no exaggeration, for it was made of a house rabbit so big that Sancho, as he handled it, took it to be made of a goat, not to say a kid, and looking at it he said, “And do you carry this with you, senor?” “Why, what are you thinking about?” said the other; “do you take me for some paltry squire? I carry a better larder on my horse’s croup than a general takes with him when he goes on a march.” Sancho ate without requiring to be pressed, and in the dark bolted mouthfuls like the knots on a tether, and said he, “You are a proper trusty squire, one of the right sort, sumptuous and grand, as this banquet shows, which, if it has not come here by magic art, at any rate has the look of it; not like me, unlucky beggar, that have nothing more in my alforjas than a scrap of cheese, so hard that one might brain a giant with it, and, to keep it company, a few dozen carobs and as many more filberts and walnuts; thanks to the austerity of my master, and the idea he has and the rule he follows, that knights-errant must not live or sustain themselves on anything except dried fruits and the herbs of the field.” “By my faith, brother,” said he of the Grove, “my stomach is not made for thistles, or wild pears, or roots of the woods; let our masters do as they like, with their chivalry notions and laws, and eat what those enjoin; I carry my prog-basket and this bota hanging to the saddle-bow, whatever they may say; and it is such an object of worship with me, and I love it so, that there is hardly a moment but I am kissing and embracing it over and over again;” and so saying he thrust it into Sancho’s hands, who raising it aloft pointed to his mouth, gazed at the stars for a quarter of an hour; and when he had done drinking let his head fall on one side, and giving a deep sigh, exclaimed, “Ah, whoreson rogue, how catholic it is!” “There, you see,” said he of the Grove, hearing Sancho’s exclamation, “how you have called this wine whoreson by way of praise.” “Well,” said Sancho, “I own it, and I grant it is no dishonour to call anyone whoreson when it is to be understood as praise. But tell me, senor, by what you love best, is this Ciudad Real wine?” “O rare wine-taster!” said he of the Grove; “nowhere else indeed does it come from, and it has some years’ age too.” “Leave me alone for that,” said Sancho; “never fear but I’ll hit upon the place it came from somehow. What would you say, sir squire, to my having such a great natural instinct in judging wines that you have only to let me smell one and I can tell positively its country, its kind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo, and everything that appertains to a wine? But it is no wonder, for I have had in my family, on my father’s side, the two best wine-tasters that have been known in La Mancha for many a long year, and to prove it I’ll tell you now a thing that happened them. They gave the two of them some wine out of a cask, to try, asking their opinion as to the condition, quality, goodness or badness of the wine. One of them tried it with the tip of his tongue, the other did no more than bring it to his nose. The first said the wine had a flavour of iron, the second said it had a stronger flavour of cordovan. The owner said the cask was clean, and that nothing had been added to the wine from which it could have got a flavour of either iron or leather. Nevertheless, these two great wine-tasters held to what they had said. Time went by, the wine was sold, and when they came to clean out the cask, they found in it a small key hanging to a thong of cordovan; see now if one who comes of the same stock has not a right to give his opinion in such like cases.” “Therefore, I say,” said he of the Grove, “let us give up going in quest of adventures, and as we have loaves let us not go looking for cakes, but return to our cribs, for God will find us there if it be his will.” “Until my master reaches Saragossa,” said Sancho, “I’ll remain in his service; after that we’ll see.” The end of it was that the two squires talked so much and drank so much that sleep had to tie their tongues and moderate their thirst, for to quench it was impossible; and so the pair of them fell asleep clinging to the now nearly empty bota and with half-chewed morsels in their mouths; and there we will leave them for the present, to relate what passed between the Knight of the Grove and him of the Rueful Countenance. 骑士和侍从分成两对，侍从谈自己的生活，骑士谈自己的爱情。故事首先介绍侍从的谈话，然后才是主人的议论。据说，两个侍从离开主人一段距离后，森林骑士的侍从对桑乔说： “我的大人，咱们这些当游侠骑士侍从的，日子过得真辛苦。上帝诅咒咱们的祖先时说过，让他们就着脸上的汗水吃面包。咱们现在就是这样。” “还可以说咱们是腹中冰冷吃面包。”桑乔说，“谁能像咱们游侠骑士的侍从这样经受严寒酷暑呢？如果有吃的还算好，肚里有食就不那么难受，可咱们常常是一两天没有吃的，只能喝风。” “不过与此同时，咱们也可望得到奖励。”森林骑士的侍从说，“如果被服侍的游侠骑士不是特别倒霉，侍从至少可以得到某个岛屿总督的美差，或者当个满不错的伯爵。” “我已经同我的主人讲过，”桑乔说，“我当个岛屿总督就满足了。我的主人已经慷慨地允诺过好几次了。” “我服侍主人一场，能随便有个美差就满足了。”森林骑士的侍从说，“我的主人已经答应给我一个美差，真不错！” “您的主人一定是个教团骑士，”桑乔说，“所以如果服侍得好，他就会奖励他的侍从。可我的主人绝对不是教团骑士。我记得有些聪明人曾劝他做红衣大主教，可我看那些人是别有用心，而我的主人一心只想当皇帝。我当时怕得要命，怕他忽然心血来潮，当了主教，因为教会里的事我做不了。我还可以告诉您，虽然我看起来像个人似的，可要是做起教会里的事来，那就连牲口都不如了。” “这您就错了，”森林骑士的侍从说，“岛屿总督也不是那么好干的。有的总督很不幸，有的很可怜，也有的悒悒不欢。混得好的也是心事重重，不得安宁，命运在他肩上放了一副沉重的担子。从事咱们这苦差的人最好都回家去，做些轻松的事情散散心，比如打猎钓鱼。世界上恐怕还没有哪位侍从穷得家里连一匹马、几只猎兔狗和一根钓鱼竿都没有。” “这些我都有，”桑乔说，“不过我没有马，这是真的。可是我有头驴，比我主人的马贵重两倍多。他要想换我这头驴，就是再加四担小麦，而且就在下个复活节换，我也不会换。算我复活节倒霉！我的小灰儿，我那头驴是灰色的，在我眼里是如此值钱，大概让您见笑了。至于猎兔狗，我有不少，我们村里也有的是。要是能借别人的光打猎就更有意思了。” “真的，”森林骑士的侍从说，“侍从大人，我已经打算并且决定离开这些疯疯癫癫的游侠骑士了。我要回到我的家乡去，哺养我的孩子们。我有三个东方明珠一般的孩子。” “我有两个孩子，”桑乔说，“漂亮得简直可以面见教皇。特别是我那女儿，上帝保佑，我准备培养她当伯爵夫人，不管她妈愿意不愿意。” “您那个准备做伯爵夫人的女儿芳龄多少啦？”森林骑士的侍从问。 “十五岁上下，上下不相差两岁吧，”桑乔说，“已经长得像长矛一样高了，而且楚楚动人，力气大过脚夫。” “那她不仅可以做伯爵夫人，”森林骑士的侍从说，“而且可以做绿色森林的仙女。噢，这个婊子养的，多棒啊！” 桑乔听了有些不高兴地说道： “她不是婊子，她妈也不是婊子。上帝保佑，只要我活着，她们谁也当不了婊子。您说话得有点礼貌，亏得您还受过游侠骑士的栽培呢，应该同游侠骑士一样有礼貌。我觉得您那些话说得不合适。” “哎呀，您怎么把这样高级的赞扬理解错了，侍从大人？”森林骑士的侍从说，“您怎么会不知道，如果一位骑士在斗牛场上往牛背扎了很漂亮的一枪，或者某个人某件事干得非常出色时，人家往往说：‘嘿，这个婊子养的，干得真棒！’这句话貌似粗野，实际上是很高的赞扬。大人，如果您的儿子或女儿没有做出令他们的父母受到如此称赞的事业来，您就别认他们。” “是的，那我就不认他们。”桑乔说，“既然这样，您完全可以把我和我的孩子、老婆都称作婊子。我的老婆孩子的所作所为对这种赞扬绝对受之无愧。为了能够回去见到他们，我祈求上帝免除我的死罪，也就是免除我当侍从的危险行当。我鬼迷心窍，再一次从事了侍从的行当。有一天，我曾在莫雷纳山深处捡到一个装着一百杜卡多的口袋，魔鬼把钱袋一会儿放这儿，一会儿放那儿，让我觉得似乎唾手可得，可以把它抱回家，用来放印子，收利息，过无忧无虑的日子。也就是这种打算让我跟着我这位愚蠢的主人含垢忍辱，我知道，与其说他是骑士，还不如说他是个疯子！” “所以人们常说，贪得无厌。”森林骑士的侍从说，“要提到疯子，我的主人可谓天下第一。你应该明白，‘驴子劳累死，全为别人忙’。他为了让别的骑士恢复神志，自己反而变疯了；他要寻找的东西，要是真找到了，我不知道他会不会又后悔。” “他大概正在恋爱吧？”桑乔问。 “是的，”森林骑士的侍从说，“他爱上了班达利亚的卡西尔德亚。世界上恐怕再没有比她更冷冰冰的女人了。不过，她最坏的地方还不在于冷冰冰，而在于她有一肚子坏水，并且很快就能显露出来。” “世上无坦途，”桑乔说，“总不免有些磕磕碰碰；‘家家有本难念的经，而我家的经最难念’；‘疯子的伙伴倒比正常人的多’。不过，有句俗话说得很对，‘债多不愁，人多不忧’，有您在我就感到宽慰了，因为您服侍的主人同我的主人一样愚蠢。” “蠢是蠢，但是很勇敢，”森林骑士的侍从说，“而且论起卑鄙来，比愚蠢和勇敢的程度还要厉害得多。” “我的主人不这样。”桑乔说，“我认为他一点儿也不卑鄙，相反，人很实在，不对任何人使坏，而且对所有人都好，绝无害人之心。如果一个孩子告诉他白天是黑夜，他也会相信。就冲他这种单纯劲儿，我就从心眼里喜欢他，他就是做出再愚蠢的事，我也不忍心离开他。” “即使如此，兄弟呀，”森林骑士的侍从说，“瞎子领瞎子，就有双双掉进坑里的危险。咱们最好趁早止步，干咱们自己的事情去。要征险并不等于就能征到真正的艰险。” 桑乔不时地吐点儿什么，看样子是很粘的唾液。森林骑士那位好心肠的侍从看到了，说道： “我觉得咱们说得太多了，舌头和上腭都快粘上了。我那匹马的鞍架上带着点儿生津的东西，效果挺不错的。” 说着他站了起来，不一会儿就拿回一大皮囊葡萄酒和一个大馅饼。我一点儿不夸张，那馅饼足有一尺见方。馅是用一只大白兔的肉做的。桑乔摸了摸，以为是一只羊的肉做的，而且不是小羊羔，是大山羊。桑乔说： “难道您把这个也随身带着，大人？” “怎么，想不到吧？”那个侍从说，“我不过是个微不足道的侍从，但是我在马屁股上带的食物比一个将军出门时带的食物还要好。” 不等人家让，桑乔就狼吞虎咽地吃起来了，还说： “您真是个忠实合格的侍从，既普通又优秀，而且伟大，这顿饭就可以证明这一点，除非这顿饭是魔法变出来的。看样子它倒是有点像变出来的。我就不行了，既卑微又倒霉。我的褡裢里只有一点奶酪，还挺硬，硬得能把巨人的脑袋打破。此外，还有几十个野豌豆，几十个榛子和胡桃。这全怨我的主人墨守成规，坚持认为游侠骑士只能用干果和田野里的野草充饥。” “兄弟，”森林骑士的侍从说，“我相信我的胃受不了什么洋蓟、野梨和山里的野根。让咱们的主人去说他们的骑士规矩吧，让他们去吃他们说应该吃的东西吧，反正我带着凉菜盒，鞍架上还带着酒囊，算作备用。我特别喜欢酒，不时要抱着酒囊亲亲。” 说完，他把酒囊递给桑乔。桑乔把酒囊举到嘴边，头朝上足有一刻钟。喝完后，他把头垂到一旁，长吁了一口气，说： “嘿，婊子养的，好家伙，真不错！” “您称赞酒好怎么能说是‘婊子养的’呢？”森林骑士的侍从听到桑乔说“婊子养的”，就对桑乔说道。 “如果是赞美，”桑乔说，“称某人‘婊子养的’并不是贬义。凭您最喜爱的年代发誓，大人，请您告诉我，这酒是皇城里出的吗？” “好一个品酒鬼！”森林骑士的侍从说，“这酒正是皇城里出的，而且是陈年老酒。” “瞒得了我吗？”桑乔说，“可别小看了我这套本领。侍从大人，我天生就有高超的品酒本领难道不好吗？只要让我闻一闻某种酒，我就可以准确地说出它的产地、品种、味道、贮存时间、是否还会变化以及其他种种有关情况。不过，这也没什么可惊奇的，我家祖上就有两位是曼查多年从未有过的优秀品酒师。为了证明这点，我给您讲一件他们的事。有一次，人们拉来一桶葡萄酒让他们品尝，请他们两人说说酒的质量好坏。他们一个用舌头尖舔了舔酒，另一个只是把鼻子凑到酒前闻了闻。第一个人说有股铁器味，第二个人说还有熟羊皮味。可酒的主人说酒桶是干净的，酒里没有放任何鞣料，不会产生出什么铁器味和熟羊皮味。尽管如此，两位著名的品酒师仍然坚持自己的说法。过了一段时间之后，酒卖完了，人们刷酒桶的时候发现，里面有一串用熟羊皮圈拴着的小钥匙。这回您就该知道了，出身世家，自有所长。” “所以我说，”森林骑士的侍从说，“咱们也别去征什么险了。家里有面包，就不必去找蛋糕，还是回家好。要是上帝想找咱们，就到咱们家里去找吧。” “等我服侍主人到了萨拉戈萨以后，咱们再商量。” 后来，两位友好的侍从又是说又是喝，直到困倦了才闭上嘴，缓解一下口渴。要想让他们不渴是不可能的。两个人抓着已经快空了的酒囊，嘴里含着还没嚼烂的食物睡着了。咱们现在别再说他们了，来谈谈森林骑士和猥獕骑士那儿的事吧。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4634.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
