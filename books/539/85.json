{"id":42225,"no":85,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 31","content":"Supreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt at seeing himself, as it seemed, an established favourite with the duchess, for he looked forward to finding in her castle what he had found in Don Diego’s house and in Basilio’s; he was always fond of good living, and always seized by the forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presented itself. The history informs us, then, that before they reached the country house or castle, the duke went on in advance and instructed all his servants how they were to treat Don Quixote; and so the instant he came up to the castle gates with the duchess, two lackeys or equerries, clad in what they call morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to their feet, hastened out, and catching Don Quixote in their arms before he saw or heard them, said to him, “Your highness should go and take my lady the duchess off her horse.”\n \n Don Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed between the two over the matter; but in the end the duchess’s determination carried the day, and she refused to get down or dismount from her palfrey except in the arms of the duke, saying she did not consider herself worthy to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight. At length the duke came out to take her down, and as they entered a spacious court two fair damsels came forward and threw over Don Quixote’s shoulders a large mantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and at the same instant all the galleries of the court were lined with the men-servants and women-servants of the household, crying, “Welcome, flower and cream of knight-errantry!” while all or most of them flung pellets filled with scented water over Don Quixote and the duke and duchess; at all which Don Quixote was greatly astonished, and this was the first time that he thoroughly felt and believed himself to be a knight-errant in reality and not merely in fancy, now that he saw himself treated in the same way as he had read of such knights being treated in days of yore.\n Sancho, deserting Dapple, hung on to the duchess and entered the castle, but feeling some twinges of conscience at having left the ass alone, he approached a respectable duenna who had come out with the rest to receive the duchess, and in a low voice he said to her, “Senora Gonzalez, or however your grace may be called — ”\n “I am called Dona Rodriguez de Grijalba,” replied the duenna; “what is your will, brother?” To which Sancho made answer, “I should be glad if your worship would do me the favour to go out to the castle gate, where you will find a grey ass of mine; make them, if you please, put him in the stable, or put him there yourself, for the poor little beast is rather easily frightened, and cannot bear being alone at all.”\n “If the master is as wise as the man,” said the duenna, “we have got a fine bargain. Be off with you, brother, and bad luck to you and him who brought you here; go, look after your ass, for we, the duennas of this house, are not used to work of that sort.”\n “Well then, in troth,” returned Sancho, “I have heard my master, who is the very treasure-finder of stories, telling the story of Lancelot when he came from Britain, say that ladies waited upon him and duennas upon his hack; and, if it comes to my ass, I wouldn’t change him for Senor Lancelot’s hack.”\n “If you are a jester, brother,” said the duenna, “keep your drolleries for some place where they’ll pass muster and be paid for; for you’ll get nothing from me but a fig.”\n “At any rate, it will be a very ripe one,” said Sancho, “for you won’t lose the trick in years by a point too little.”\n “Son of a bitch,” said the duenna, all aglow with anger, “whether I’m old or not, it’s with God I have to reckon, not with you, you garlic-stuffed scoundrel!” and she said it so loud, that the duchess heard it, and turning round and seeing the duenna in such a state of excitement, and her eyes flaming so, asked whom she was wrangling with.\n “With this good fellow here,” said the duenna, “who has particularly requested me to go and put an ass of his that is at the castle gate into the stable, holding it up to me as an example that they did the same I don’t know where — that some ladies waited on one Lancelot, and duennas on his hack; and what is more, to wind up with, he called me old.”\n “That,” said the duchess, “I should have considered the greatest affront that could be offered me;” and addressing Sancho, she said to him, “You must know, friend Sancho, that Dona Rodriguez is very youthful, and that she wears that hood more for authority and custom sake than because of her years.”\n “May all the rest of mine be unlucky,” said Sancho, “if I meant it that way; I only spoke because the affection I have for my ass is so great, and I thought I could not commend him to a more kind-hearted person than the lady Dona Rodriguez.”\n Don Quixote, who was listening, said to him, “Is this proper conversation for the place, Sancho?”\n “Senor,” replied Sancho, “every one must mention what he wants wherever he may be; I thought of Dapple here, and I spoke of him here; if I had thought of him in the stable I would have spoken there.”\n On which the duke observed, “Sancho is quite right, and there is no reason at all to find fault with him; Dapple shall be fed to his heart’s content, and Sancho may rest easy, for he shall be treated like himself.”\n While this conversation, amusing to all except Don Quixote, was proceeding, they ascended the staircase and ushered Don Quixote into a chamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relieved him of his armour and waited on him like pages, all of them prepared and instructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, and how they were to treat Don Quixote, so that he might see and believe they were treating him like a knight-errant. When his armour was removed, there stood Don Quixote in his tight-fitting breeches and chamois doublet, lean, lanky, and long, with cheeks that seemed to be kissing each other inside; such a figure, that if the damsels waiting on him had not taken care to check their merriment (which was one of the particular directions their master and mistress had given them), they would have burst with laughter. They asked him to let himself be stripped that they might put a shirt on him, but he would not on any account, saying that modesty became knights-errant just as much as valour. However, he said they might give the shirt to Sancho; and shutting himself in with him in a room where there was a sumptuous bed, he undressed and put on the shirt; and then, finding himself alone with Sancho, he said to him, “Tell me, thou new-fledged buffoon and old booby, dost thou think it right to offend and insult a duenna so deserving of reverence and respect as that one just now? Was that a time to bethink thee of thy Dapple, or are these noble personages likely to let the beasts fare badly when they treat their owners in such elegant style? For God’s sake, Sancho, restrain thyself, and don’t show the thread so as to let them see what a coarse, boorish texture thou art of. Remember, sinner that thou art, the master is the more esteemed the more respectable and well-bred his servants are; and that one of the greatest advantages that princes have over other men is that they have servants as good as themselves to wait on them. Dost thou not see — shortsighted being that thou art, and unlucky mortal that I am! — that if they perceive thee to be a coarse clown or a dull blockhead, they will suspect me to be some impostor or swindler? Nay, nay, Sancho friend, keep clear, oh, keep clear of these stumbling-blocks; for he who falls into the way of being a chatterbox and droll, drops into a wretched buffoon the first time he trips; bridle thy tongue, consider and weigh thy words before they escape thy mouth, and bear in mind we are now in quarters whence, by God’s help, and the strength of my arm, we shall come forth mightily advanced in fame and fortune.”\n Sancho promised him with much earnestness to keep his mouth shut, and to bite off his tongue before he uttered a word that was not altogether to the purpose and well considered, and told him he might make his mind easy on that point, for it should never be discovered through him what they were.\n Don Quixote dressed himself, put on his baldric with his sword, threw the scarlet mantle over his shoulders, placed on his head a montera of green satin that the damsels had given him, and thus arrayed passed out into the large room, where he found the damsels drawn up in double file, the same number on each side, all with the appliances for washing the hands, which they presented to him with profuse obeisances and ceremonies. Then came twelve pages, together with the seneschal, to lead him to dinner, as his hosts were already waiting for him. They placed him in the midst of them, and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him into another room, where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers. The duchess and the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him, and with them a grave ecclesiastic, one of those who rule noblemen’s houses; one of those who, not being born magnates themselves, never know how to teach those who are how to behave as such; one of those who would have the greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind; one of those who, when they try to introduce economy into the household they rule, lead it into meanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote.\n A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it.\n The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the table, he said, “If your worship will give me leave I will tell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.”\n The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he was about to say something foolish. Sancho glanced at him, and guessing his thoughts, said, “Don’t be afraid of my going astray, senor, or saying anything that won’t be pat to the purpose; I haven’t forgotten the advice your worship gave me just now about talking much or little, well or ill.”\n “I have no recollection of anything, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “say what thou wilt, only say it quickly.”\n “Well then,” said Sancho, “what I am going to say is so true that my master Don Quixote, who is here present, will keep me from lying.”\n “Lie as much as thou wilt for all I care, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for I am not going to stop thee, but consider what thou art going to say.”\n “I have so considered and reconsidered,” said Sancho, “that the bell-ringer’s in a safe berth; as will be seen by what follows.”\n “It would be well,” said Don Quixote, “if your highnesses would order them to turn out this idiot, for he will talk a heap of nonsense.”\n “By the life of the duke, Sancho shall not be taken away from me for a moment,” said the duchess; “I am very fond of him, for I know he is very discreet.”\n “Discreet be the days of your holiness,” said Sancho, “for the good opinion you have of my wit, though there’s none in me; but the story I want to tell is this. There was an invitation given by a gentleman of my town, a very rich one, and one of quality, for he was one of the Alamos of Medina del Campo, and married to Dona Mencia de Quinones, the daughter of Don Alonso de Maranon, Knight of the Order of Santiago, that was drowned at the Herradura — him there was that quarrel about years ago in our village, that my master Don Quixote was mixed up in, to the best of my belief, that Tomasillo the scapegrace, the son of Balbastro the smith, was wounded in. — Isn’t all this true, master mine? As you live, say so, that these gentlefolk may not take me for some lying chatterer.”\n “So far,” said the ecclesiastic, “I take you to be more a chatterer than a liar; but I don’t know what I shall take you for by-and-by.”\n “Thou citest so many witnesses and proofs, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that I have no choice but to say thou must be telling the truth; go on, and cut the story short, for thou art taking the way not to make an end for two days to come.”\n “He is not to cut it short,” said the duchess; “on the contrary, for my gratification, he is to tell it as he knows it, though he should not finish it these six days; and if he took so many they would be to me the pleasantest I ever spent.”\n “Well then, sirs, I say,” continued Sancho, “that this same gentleman, whom I know as well as I do my own hands, for it’s not a bowshot from my house to his, invited a poor but respectable labourer — ”\n “Get on, brother,” said the churchman; “at the rate you are going you will not stop with your story short of the next world.”\n “I’ll stop less than half-way, please God,” said Sancho; “and so I say this labourer, coming to the house of the gentleman I spoke of that invited him — rest his soul, he is now dead; and more by token he died the death of an angel, so they say; for I was not there, for just at that time I had gone to reap at Tembleque — ”\n “As you live, my son,” said the churchman, “make haste back from Tembleque, and finish your story without burying the gentleman, unless you want to make more funerals.”\n “Well then, it so happened,” said Sancho, “that as the pair of them were going to sit down to table — and I think I can see them now plainer than ever — ”\n Great was the enjoyment the duke and duchess derived from the irritation the worthy churchman showed at the long-winded, halting way Sancho had of telling his story, while Don Quixote was chafing with rage and vexation.\n “So, as I was saying,” continued Sancho, “as the pair of them were going to sit down to table, as I said, the labourer insisted upon the gentleman’s taking the head of the table, and the gentleman insisted upon the labourer’s taking it, as his orders should be obeyed in his house; but the labourer, who plumed himself on his politeness and good breeding, would not on any account, until the gentleman, out of patience, putting his hands on his shoulders, compelled him by force to sit down, saying, ‘Sit down, you stupid lout, for wherever I sit will he the head to you; and that’s the story, and, troth, I think it hasn’t been brought in amiss here.”\n Don Quixote turned all colours, which, on his sunburnt face, mottled it till it looked like jasper. The duke and duchess suppressed their laughter so as not altogether to mortify Don Quixote, for they saw through Sancho’s impertinence; and to change the conversation, and keep Sancho from uttering more absurdities, the duchess asked Don Quixote what news he had of the lady Dulcinea, and if he had sent her any presents of giants or miscreants lately, for he could not but have vanquished a good many.\n To which Don Quixote replied, “Senora, my misfortunes, though they had a beginning, will never have an end. I have vanquished giants and I have sent her caitiffs and miscreants; but where are they to find her if she is enchanted and turned into the most ill-favoured peasant wench that can be imagined?”\n “I don’t know,” said Sancho Panza; “to me she seems the fairest creature in the world; at any rate, in nimbleness and jumping she won’t give in to a tumbler; by my faith, senora duchess, she leaps from the ground on to the back of an ass like a cat.”\n “Have you seen her enchanted, Sancho?” asked the duke.\n “What, seen her!” said Sancho; “why, who the devil was it but myself that first thought of the enchantment business? She is as much enchanted as my father.”\n The ecclesiastic, when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs and enchantments, began to suspect that this must be Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose story the duke was always reading; and he had himself often reproved him for it, telling him it was foolish to read such fooleries; and becoming convinced that his suspicion was correct, addressing the duke, he said very angrily to him, “Senor, your excellence will have to give account to God for what this good man does. This Don Quixote, or Don Simpleton, or whatever his name is, cannot, I imagine, be such a blockhead as your excellence would have him, holding out encouragement to him to go on with his vagaries and follies.” Then turning to address Don Quixote he said, “And you, num-skull, who put it into your head that you are a knight-errant, and vanquish giants and capture miscreants? Go your ways in a good hour, and in a good hour be it said to you. Go home and bring up your children if you have any, and attend to your business, and give over going wandering about the world, gaping and making a laughing-stock of yourself to all who know you and all who don’t. Where, in heaven’s name, have you discovered that there are or ever were knights-errant? Where are there giants in Spain or miscreants in La Mancha, or enchanted Dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things they tell about you?”\n Don Quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman’s words, and as soon as he perceived he had done speaking, regardless of the presence of the duke and duchess, he sprang to his feet with angry looks and an agitated countenance, and said — But the reply deserves a chapter to itself.\n \n 桑乔感觉自己得到了公爵夫人的赏识，很高兴。他想，他在这座城堡里得到的款待不会亚于在迭戈和巴西利奥家得到的待遇。桑乔总是想过舒适的生活，所以只要有机会，他就决不放过。\n 据说公爵抢先一步回到了别墅或者城堡，向佣人们吩咐接待唐吉诃德的方法。唐吉诃德刚同公爵夫人来到城堡门口，就有两个穿着洋红色细缎晨衣的仆役或马夫从城堡里出来，把唐吉诃德从马上迅速扶了下来，又对唐吉诃德说：\n “请您扶我们的公爵夫人下马。”\n 唐吉诃德要去扶公爵夫人下马，结果两人客气了半天，公爵夫人坚持要公爵抱她下马，说不能让堂堂的大骑士做这种小事。最后，还是公爵出来把她抱下了马。他们刚走进一个大院子，就有两位美丽的少女往唐吉诃德肩上披了一条红色大披巾。院子的走廊里立刻挤满了男女佣人，他们高声喊道：\n “欢迎游侠骑士的精英！”\n 所有人，或者说大部分人，还往唐吉诃德、公爵和公爵夫人身上洒香水。唐吉诃德又惊又喜，这是他第一次切切实实地体验到自己是个游侠骑士了。这并非幻觉，他亲身体验到了过去只有在书里才能看到的游侠骑士所享受的待遇。\n 桑乔没有去照顾他的驴，紧随着公爵夫人进了城堡。可是，他又不忍心把驴孤零零地留在外面，就走到一群出来迎接公爵夫人的女仆面前，对其中一位老妇低声说：\n “冈萨雷斯夫人，或者您的芳名是……”\n “我叫唐娜罗德里格斯·德格里哈尔瓦。”老妇说道，“你有什么吩咐，兄弟？”\n 桑乔回答道：\n “我想请您出城堡门一趟，我的灰驴还在外面。劳驾您找人或者您本人把它带到马厩里去。那可怜的驴胆小，从来没这样单独待过。”\n “主人聪明，侍从也机灵，”老妇说，“真让我们长见识。去你的吧，兄弟，算你和带你来的那个人倒霉，你还是自己去照顾你的驴吧，这儿的女仆可没干过这种活儿！”\n “可是，我确实听我的主人说过兰萨罗特的故事。我的主人满肚子都是故事。他说过：\n 他来自布列塔尼，\n 夫人们为他治伤，\n 女仆们为他看驴。\n 我这头驴，要是兰萨罗特大人拿他的坐骑来换，我还不干呢。”\n “兄弟，你真有意思。”老妇说，“把你的滑稽留到有人掏钱听你说的地方去说吧，我这儿最多只能给你一下子。”\n “那可好，”桑乔说，“您这一下子准轻不了。冲您这把年纪，您准亏不了！”\n “婊子养的！”老妇发起怒来，说道，“我年纪老不老，我自己会告诉上帝，用不着告诉你，你这个混蛋，没教养的东西！”\n 老妇这句话的声音很高，公爵夫人也听见了。她回过头来，看见老妇怒不可遏，眼睛都红了，就问她在同谁说话。\n “我刚才同这位好人说话，”老妇说，“他非叫我把城堡门口他的驴送到马厩去，还举例说，不知是在什么地方，有几位夫人为一个兰萨罗特治伤，有女仆照看他的驴。最不像话的就是他竟说我老了。”\n “如果是说我，”公爵夫人说，“我也会觉得这话比什么都厉害。”\n 她又对桑乔说：\n “你应该知道，桑乔朋友，唐娜罗德里格斯还很年轻。她戴头巾主要是保持尊严和出于习惯，并不是因为年纪大了。”\n “我要是有那个意思，就让我余生不得安宁！”桑乔说，“我只是想说，我太心疼我的驴了，要交给像唐娜罗德里格斯夫人这样慈祥的人照管才行。”\n 这些话唐吉诃德全听到了。他对桑乔说：\n “这些话是在这种地方讲的吗？”\n “大人，”桑乔说，“一个人不论在什么地方，都可以按照自己的需要讲话。我在这儿想起了驴，就在这儿说驴；如果我在马厩里想起来，就在马厩里说。”\n 公爵说道：\n “桑乔说得很对，他完全没有责任。桑乔你尽管放心，你的驴会得到应有的照顾，他们会像对待你一样对待你的驴。”\n 公爵这么一说，大家都很高兴，只有唐吉诃德除外。大家登上城堡高处，把唐吉诃德让进一座装饰着极其贵重的金色锦缎的客厅。六名少女帮助唐吉诃德脱下盔甲。这些少女事先已被公爵和公爵夫人教过，应当如何招待唐吉诃德，以便让他觉得自己是被当作游侠骑士款待的。唐吉诃德脱去盔甲后，身上只剩瘦腿裤和羊皮紧身坎肩，显得又细又高又瘦又干瘪，两颊瘦得几乎贴在一起了。看他那个样子，若不是主人事先嘱咐的几点注意事项里有一项是必须忍住笑，这几位少女早就笑出声来了。\n 她们请求唐吉诃德把衣服都脱下来，她们要给他换件衬衣。唐吉诃德坚决不同意，说游侠骑士的尊严同勇气一样重要。不过，他让人把衬衣交给了桑乔，自己则同桑乔一起躲进了一个小房间。房间里有个豪华床，唐吉诃德脱光衣服，换上了衬衣。他见只有自己和桑乔在场，就对桑乔说道：\n “告诉我，你这个新小丑、老笨蛋，你觉得让那样一位令人尊敬的老妇人难堪对吗？那是你说你的驴的时候吗？或者说，像他们这样的大人既然能对客人百般照顾，还能让客人的驴受委屈吗？上帝保佑，桑乔，你得注意点儿，别露了馅，让人看出你是个乡巴佬。你呀，真糟糕！你记住，佣人表现得越好，越有教养，主人就越受到尊重；王公贵人居于其他人之上的一大高贵之处就是：他们拥有像自己一样高贵的佣人。算你苦命。算我倒霉！你难道没发现，如果人们看出你是个粗俗的乡巴佬或滑稽的傻瓜，就会把我也当成江湖骗子、冒牌骑士？别这样了，桑乔朋友，千万别再做这些失礼的事情了。爱多嘴又爱出洋相的人稍有闪失，就会被人看成是令人讨厌的骗子。管好你的舌头吧，说话之前再三考虑一下，别忘了，承蒙上帝的恩赐，靠我臂膀的力量，咱们的名声以及财产前景可观呢。”\n 桑乔十分恳切地答应唐吉诃德，他一定会按照主人的吩咐，管好自己的嘴巴，藏好自己的舌头，不经过仔细考虑不说话。他让唐吉诃德放心，自己不会给主人丢脸。\n 唐吉诃德穿好衣服，把皮肩带连同剑披挂在身上，再披上红色的披巾，戴上少女们为他准备的绿缎帽子。穿戴停当，他走出小房间，来到一个大厅里。少女们分排站立，手里都端着洗手水，毕恭毕敬地请他洗手。十二个侍者连同管家又来请他去吃饭，说主人已经在恭候了。这些人前呼后拥地围着唐吉诃德来到了另一个大厅，厅里已经摆好一桌丰盛的酒席，桌子上只有四套餐具。公爵和公爵夫人在大厅门口迎接，他们身旁还有一位庄重的教士，这种教士是专为贵族管家的。这种教士并非出身于贵族，所以并不知道该如何教育贵族，而是以小人之心去度君子之腹。所以，他们只希望他们管理的贵族家庭心胸狭隘，成为可怜人。我说的这位陪同公爵和公爵夫人出来迎接唐吉诃德的教士，大概就是这种人。他们极其客气地寒暄一番，又左右相伴地陪同唐吉诃德来到桌前。公爵请唐吉诃德坐在首席上。尽管唐吉诃德再三推辞，公爵还是坚持，唐吉诃德只好从命。教士坐在唐吉诃德的对面，公爵和公爵夫人分坐在唐吉诃德两侧。\n 桑乔也一直在场。他看到公爵夫妇对唐吉诃德如此礼遇，不胜惊奇。他见公爵和唐吉诃德你推我让，互相请对方坐在首席，就说：\n “如果你们二位允许的话，我给你们讲一个我们村里关于坐席的故事吧。”\n 桑乔此话一出口，唐吉诃德不禁一哆嗦，他知道桑乔肯定又要说什么傻话了。桑乔看见了，懂得唐吉诃德的心思，就说道：\n “我的大人，您不必害怕我会胡来，或者说一些不该说的东西。您嘱咐我的说多说少、说好说坏那一套，我都没忘。”\n “我倒什么也不记得了，桑乔。”唐吉诃德说，“你随便说吧，反正你来得快。”\n “我说的都是实话，”桑乔说，“有我的主人唐吉诃德在场，他不让我说谎。”\n “你随便说谎，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“我不管，不过你说话要先想想。”\n “我已经再三想过了，谁想找茬儿都没门儿，您回头就知道了。”\n “诸位最好还是让这个笨蛋出去吧，”唐吉诃德说，“否则他不知道要说多少胡话呢。”\n “我以公爵的名义发誓，”公爵夫人说，“千万别让桑乔走开。我很喜欢他，他很机灵。”\n “承蒙您对我信任，”桑乔说，“可是我并不机灵。但愿夫人您永远机灵。我要讲的故事是这样的：我们村的一个贵族要请客。这个贵族很富有，而且有势力，是阿拉莫斯·德梅迪纳·德尔坎波家族的人。他同圣地亚哥骑士团骑士唐阿隆索·马拉尼翁的女儿唐娜门西亚·基尼奥内斯结了婚。唐阿隆索·马拉尼翁在埃拉杜拉淹死了，为此几年前在我们村还发生过一场争斗。我记得我的主人唐吉诃德也参加了，结果铁匠巴尔巴斯特罗的儿子，那个淘气鬼托马西略受了伤……这难道不是真事吗，我的主人？您倒是说句话呀，别让他们以为我是个多嘴多舌的骗子。”\n “在此之前，”教士说，“我认为你倒不像说谎的人，只像个多嘴的人，不过从现在开始，我就不知道该怎么看你了。”\n 唐吉诃德说：“你举了这么多例证，桑乔，又介绍了这么多情况，我不能不说，你说的大概都是实话。你接着说吧，把故事讲简短些。照你这么讲，两天也讲不完。”\n “你不必讲得简短，”公爵夫人说，“我喜欢听。相反，你知道什么就讲什么，即使六天都讲不完也没关系。如果真能讲那么多天，那也是我平生最愉快的日子。”\n “那么，诸位大人，”桑乔接着说下去，“我对这个贵族了如指掌，他家离我家只有一箭之地。他请的客人是个穷农夫。\n 农夫虽然穷，却是个正派人。”\n “接着说吧，兄弟，”教士说，“像你这么讲，恐怕这辈子也讲不完了。”\n “只要上帝保佑，用半辈子就能讲完。”桑乔说，“后来，农夫到了那个请客的贵族家。那个贵族现在已经死了，愿他的灵魂安息。据说他死得很安详。我当时不在场，到腾布莱克收割去了……”\n “我的天啊，那你就赶紧从腾布莱克回来吧。如果你不想为那个贵族举行葬礼，就把他埋了拉倒，赶紧把故事讲完吧。”\n “问题是，”桑乔说，“当两个人正要入席的时候……此刻他们好像就在我眼前，很清楚。”\n 教士见桑乔讲得罗罗嗦嗦，断断续续，很不耐烦，唐吉诃德也是强压着怒火，公爵和公爵夫人却听得津津有味。\n “我刚才说，他们正要入席。”桑乔说，“农夫一定要贵族坐在首席，贵族则坚持让农夫坐在首席，说在他家里就得听他的。可农夫自以为懂规矩，有教养，就是不肯坐在首席。后来那贵族火了，双手按着农夫的肩膀，硬逼他坐了下来，并且对他说：‘坐下吧，你这个笨蛋，我无论坐在什么地方，总是在你上首。’这就是我的故事。我觉得没有什么不合适的地方。”\n 唐吉诃德那本来是褐色的脸上，此时又仿佛涂上了无数种颜色。桑乔话里有话，他已经听明白了，有些羞愧难当。公爵和公爵夫人只好强忍着笑。为了转移一下话题，以免桑乔再继续说下去，公爵夫人就问唐吉诃德，有没有关于杜尔西内亚的消息；此外，他一定又打败了不少巨人和坏蛋，是不是又派他们去拜见杜尔西内亚了。唐吉诃德答道：\n “夫人，我的不幸从来都是有始有终的。我打败过巨人，我派遣过坏蛋和恶棍去拜见杜尔西为亚夫人，可是她已经被魔法变成一个难以想象的丑农妇了，我派去的那些坏蛋又怎么能找到她呢？”\n “这我就不知道了，”桑乔说，“我觉得她是世界上最漂亮的人；另外，若论轻盈和灵巧，她不亚于一个翻筋斗的演员。\n 她能像猫一样从地面一下子蹿到驴背上。”\n “你看见过那个被魔法改变了模样的杜尔西内亚夫人吗？”公爵问。\n “什么看见呀！”桑乔说，“是哪个家伙第一个发现她被魔法改变了模样的？不就是我吗？此事千真万确！”\n 教士听他们讲什么巨人呀、恶棍呀、魔法呀，意识到旁边这个客人大概就是曼查的唐吉诃德。关于唐吉诃德的那本小说公爵经常阅读。教士曾多次责怪公爵，说阅读这种胡说八道的东西本身就是一种无聊。可现在，他怀疑的事竟变成了现实。于是他十分恼火，对公爵说道：\n “大人，您必须向上帝交代这个人做的好事！这个唐吉诃德，或者唐笨蛋，或者随便怎么称呼他吧，并不像您希望的那样糊涂，他只是趁机在您面前装疯卖傻。”\n 教士又转身对唐吉诃德说：\n “还有你，蠢货，谁告诉你，说你是游侠骑士，还战胜了巨人，抓住了坏蛋？你趁早走人吧！我还告诉你，你回你的家里去，如果有孩子，养好你的孩子，管好你的财产，别再到处乱跑，装傻充愣，让认识你或不认识你的人笑话你啦。你这个倒霉鬼，无论是过去还是现在，你什么时候见过游侠骑士？西班牙有巨人吗？曼查有坏蛋吗？有你说的那个遭受魔法迫害的杜尔西内亚吗？有你说的那堆乱七八糟的东西吗？”\n 唐吉诃德认真倾听着那位令人尊敬的教士慷慨直言。见教士不说话了，唐吉诃德才不顾公爵和公爵夫人在座，满面怒容地站起来说道……\n 至于唐吉诃德怎样说，需专门记录一章。\n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4652.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
