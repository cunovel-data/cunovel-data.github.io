{"id":42215,"no":75,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 21","content":"While Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth the last chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which were uttered and made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop, shouting, to receive the bride and bridegroom, who were approaching with musical instruments and pageantry of all sorts around them, and accompanied by the priest and the relatives of both, and all the most distinguished people of the surrounding villages. When Sancho saw the bride, he exclaimed, “By my faith, she is not dressed like a country girl, but like some fine court lady; egad, as well as I can make out, the patena she wears rich coral, and her green Cuenca stuff is thirty-pile velvet; and then the white linen trimming — by my oath, but it’s satin! Look at her hands — jet rings on them! May I never have luck if they’re not gold rings, and real gold, and set with pearls as white as a curdled milk, and every one of them worth an eye of one’s head! Whoreson baggage, what hair she has! if it’s not a wig, I never saw longer or fairer all the days of my life. See how bravely she bears herself — and her shape! Wouldn’t you say she was like a walking palm tree loaded with clusters of dates? for the trinkets she has hanging from her hair and neck look just like them. I swear in my heart she is a brave lass, and fit ‘to pass over the banks of Flanders.’”\n Don Quixote laughed at Sancho’s boorish eulogies and thought that, saving his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he had never seen a more beautiful woman. The fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt, because of the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for their wedding on the morrow. They advanced towards a theatre that stood on one side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they were to plight their troth, and from which they were to behold the dances and plays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud outcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, “Wait a little, ye, as inconsiderate as ye are hasty!” At these words all turned round, and perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a loose black coat garnished with crimson patches like flames. He was crowned (as was presently seen) with a crown of gloomy cypress, and in his hand he held a long staff. As he approached he was recognised by everyone as the gay Basilio, and all waited anxiously to see what would come of his words, in dread of some catastrophe in consequence of his appearance at such a moment. He came up at last weary and breathless, and planting himself in front of the bridal pair, drove his staff, which had a steel spike at the end, into the ground, and, with a pale face and eyes fixed on Quiteria, he thus addressed her in a hoarse, trembling voice:\n “Well dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria, that according to the holy law we acknowledge, so long as live thou canst take no husband; nor art thou ignorant either that, in my hopes that time and my own exertions would improve my fortunes, I have never failed to observe the respect due to thy honour; but thou, casting behind thee all thou owest to my true love, wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth serves to bring him not only good fortune but supreme happiness; and now to complete it (not that I think he deserves it, but inasmuch as heaven is pleased to bestow it upon him), I will, with my own hands, do away with the obstacle that may interfere with it, and remove myself from between you. Long live the rich Camacho! many a happy year may he live with the ungrateful Quiteria! and let the poor Basilio die, Basilio whose poverty clipped the wings of his happiness, and brought him to the grave!”\n And so saying, he seized the staff he had driven into the ground, and leaving one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath that concealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may he called its hilt being planted in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw himself upon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel blade appeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in his blood, and transfixed by his own weapon.\n His friends at once ran to his aid, filled with grief at his misery and sad fate, and Don Quixote, dismounting from Rocinante, hastened to support him, and took him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceased to breathe. They were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who was standing by objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him, as the instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death. Basilio, however, reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in pain, “If thou wouldst consent, cruel Quiteria, to give me thy hand as my bride in this last fatal moment, I might still hope that my rashness would find pardon, as by its means I attained the bliss of being thine.”\n Hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul rather than of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness implore God’s pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which Basilio replied that he was determined not to confess unless Quiteria first gave him her hand in marriage, for that happiness would compose his mind and give him courage to make his confession.\n Don Quixote hearing the wounded man’s entreaty, exclaimed aloud that what Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that might be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Senor Camacho’s honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the brave Basilio as if he received her direct from her father.\n “In this case,” said he, “it will be only to say ‘yes,’ and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be the grave.”\n Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and not knowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of Basilio’s friends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him her hand, so that his soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be lost, that they moved, nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria were willing to give it he was satisfied, as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his wishes for a moment. At once all assailed Quiteria and pressed her, some with prayers, and others with tears, and others with persuasive arguments, to give her hand to poor Basilio; but she, harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue, seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word, nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly what she meant to do, as Basilio now had his soul at his teeth, and there was no time for hesitation.\n \n On this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, and repentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his eyes already turned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuring the name of Quiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to die like a heathen and not like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, and kneeling, demanded his hand by signs without speaking. Basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly at her, said, “O Quiteria, why hast thou turned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life, for I have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou givest me in accepting me as thine, or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing the dread shadow of death over my eyes? What I entreat of thee, O thou fatal star to me, is that the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me, be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me afresh, but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thou shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this, or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee.”\n While uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders expected each return of faintness would take his life with it. Then Quiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her right hand the hand of Basilio, said, “No force would bend my will; as freely, therefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of a lawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free will, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought upon thee.”\n “Yes, I give it,” said Basilio, “not agitated or distracted, but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me, thus do I give myself to be thy husband.”\n “And I give myself to be thy wife,” said Quiteria, “whether thou livest many years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.”\n “For one so badly wounded,” observed Sancho at this point, “this young man has a great deal to say; they should make him leave off billing and cooing, and attend to his soul; for to my thinking he has it more on his tongue than at his teeth.”\n Basilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, and implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly wedded man, who, the instant he received the blessing, started nimbly to his feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been sheathed in his body. All the bystanders were astounded, and some, more simple than inquiring, began shouting, “A miracle, a miracle!” But Basilio replied, “No miracle, no miracle; only a trick, a trick!” The priest, perplexed and amazed, made haste to examine the wound with both hands, and found that the blade had passed, not through Basilio’s flesh and ribs, but through a hollow iron tube full of blood, which he had adroitly fixed at the place, the blood, as was afterwards ascertained, having been so prepared as not to congeal. In short, the priest and Camacho and most of those present saw they were tricked and made fools of. The bride showed no signs of displeasure at the deception; on the contrary, hearing them say that the marriage, being fraudulent, would not be valid, she said that she confirmed it afresh, whence they all concluded that the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding between the pair, whereat Camacho and his supporters were so mortified that they proceeded to revenge themselves by violence, and a great number of them drawing their swords attacked Basilio, in whose protection as many more swords were in an instant unsheathed, while Don Quixote taking the lead on horseback, with his lance over his arm and well covered with his shield, made all give way before him. Sancho, who never found any pleasure or enjoyment in such doings, retreated to the wine-jars from which he had taken his delectable skimmings, considering that, as a holy place, that spot would be respected.\n “Hold, sirs, hold!” cried Don Quixote in a loud voice; “we have no right to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us: remember love and war are the same thing, and as in war it is allowable and common to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy, so in the contests and rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed to attain the desired end are justifiable, provided they be not to the discredit or dishonour of the loved object. Quiteria belonged to Basilio and Basilio to Quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of heaven. Camacho is rich, and can purchase his pleasure when, where, and as it pleases him. Basilio has but this ewe-lamb, and no one, however powerful he may be, shall take her from him; these two whom God hath joined man cannot separate; and he who attempts it must first pass the point of this lance;” and so saying he brandished it so stoutly and dexterously that he overawed all who did not know him.\n But so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on Camacho’s mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and so the counsels of the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man, prevailed with him, and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised, and to prove it put up their swords again, inveighing against the pliancy of Quiteria rather than the craftiness of Basilio; Camacho maintaining that, if Quiteria as a maiden had such a love for Basilio, she would have loved him too as a married woman, and that he ought to thank heaven more for having taken her than for having given her.\n Camacho and those of his following, therefore, being consoled and pacified, those on Basilio’s side were appeased; and the rich Camacho, to show that he felt no resentment for the trick, and did not care about it, desired the festival to go on just as if he were married in reality. Neither Basilio, however, nor his bride, nor their followers would take any part in it, and they withdrew to Basilio’s village; for the poor, if they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those who follow, honour, and uphold them, just as the rich have those who flatter and dance attendance on them. With them they carried Don Quixote, regarding him as a man of worth and a stout one. Sancho alone had a cloud on his soul, for he found himself debarred from waiting for Camacho’s splendid feast and festival, which lasted until night; and thus dragged away, he moodily followed his master, who accompanied Basilio’s party, and left behind him the flesh-pots of Egypt; though in his heart he took them with him, and their now nearly finished skimmings that he carried in the bucket conjured up visions before his eyes of the glory and abundance of the good cheer he was losing. And so, vexed and dejected though not hungry, without dismounting from Dapple he followed in the footsteps of Rocinante.\n \n 唐吉诃德和桑乔正议论着前章说到的话题，忽听传来一阵喧闹之声。原来是一群马排成长长的队伍，热热闹闹地迎接新婚夫妇。马队周围是各种各样的乐器和表演，以及神甫、新郎新娘双方的亲属和邻村的头面人物。所有人都穿着节日的盛装。桑乔一看见新娘就说道：\n “新娘穿戴得完全不像农妇，倒像是宫廷淑女。天哪，我看见她戴的胸章是珊瑚做的，那身昆卡出的帕尔米亚呢绒是三十层的！你看，饰边是用白麻纱做的！我敢保证，那是缎子的！再看她那手上，戴的若不是玉石戒指那才怪呢。那戒指太精美了，上面还镶满了凝乳般的白珍珠，每一颗的价值都很昂贵。嘿，婊子养的①！瞧那头发，若不是假发，像这么长又这么金黄的头发，我这辈子还从来没见过呢！无论是气质还是身材，你简直挑不出一点毛病来。还可以把她比喻为挂满了果实的能走动的椰枣树，她头发和脖子上的各种首饰就像树上的一串串椰枣。我从心里发誓，这才是高雅的姑娘，才值得一娶哩。”\n ①此处桑乔表示赞叹。\n 唐吉诃德听了桑乔这番粗俗的赞扬不禁哑然失笑。同时，他也觉得除了托博索的杜尔西内亚夫人之外，比这位基特里亚更漂亮的女人，他确实没见过。美女基特里亚迎面走来，面色有些苍白，这大概是睡眠不足所致。做新娘的大致都这样，在举行婚礼的前一天晚上忙于打扮，总是睡不好。他们走近草地旁边一座铺满了地毯和鲜花的看台，婚礼和舞蹈演出都将在那里举行。这时，他们忽然听到一阵喊声，其中一个声音喊道：\n “等一等，干吗那么着急！”\n 大家闻声回头，原来是一个身穿带洋红色条饰的黑外套的男人在喊。后来人们发现，他头上戴着一顶办丧事用的柏枝冠，手里还拿着一根长长的手杖。待那人走近，大家认出他就是英俊青年巴西利奥。大家都呆住了，不知道他喊大家停下来要干什么，唯恐发生什么不测。\n 巴西利奥赶来了。他累得上气不接下气，站在新婚夫妇面前，把手杖带钢头的一端戳在地上，面无血色，两眼盯着基特里亚，声音颤抖而又沙哑地说道：\n “忘恩负义的基特里亚，你完全清楚，按照咱们信奉的神圣法则，只要我还活着，你就不应该嫁给别人。同时，你也不是不知道，我本来指望随着时间的推移，再加上我的才智，我的家境会好起来，因此对你的名誉一直很尊重。可是，你竟然辜负了我的一片苦心，不嫁给我，却想嫁给别人！他的财富不仅可以使你过得很富裕，而且可以使你过得很幸福。为了让你幸福如意，尽管我觉得你不配，但这是天意，我要用我自己的双手清除可能妨碍你们的障碍，自寻短见。万岁，富豪卡马乔和负心女基特里亚万岁！祝他们幸福千秋！死吧，让穷人巴西利奥死吧，是他的贫穷使他失去了幸福，把他送入了坟墓！”\n 说完他拔起戳在地上的手杖，露出了留在地上的长剑，原来这是一把带剑的手杖的剑鞘，可以称之为剑柄的一头仍戳在地里。巴西利奥泰然自若，但却横心已定地往上一扑，剑尖和半截钢剑立刻从他的脊背上血淋淋地露了出来。可怜的巴西利奥被自己的剑刺倒在地，躺在了血泊中。\n 他的朋友们立刻围上来救他，对他给自己造成的不幸感到悲痛万分。唐吉诃德也下马赶来救巴西利奥。唐吉诃德抱起他，发现他还没断气。大家想把剑拔出来，可是在场的一位神甫却认为，在巴西利奥忏悔之前不能把剑拔出来，因为只要一拔剑，他立刻就会咽气。此时巴西利奥已经有些苏醒了。他声音痛苦而又有气无力地说道：\n “如果你愿意的话，狠心的基特里亚，在这最后的危难时刻，请你把手伸给我，同意做我的妻子。我仍然想让我的莽撞能得到些宽慰，也就是能让我属于你。”\n 神甫听到此话后对他说，应该首先考虑自己的精神健康，其次才是身体的需要。神甫还十分诚恳地祈求上帝宽恕巴西利奥的罪恶和轻生。巴西利奥回答说，如果基特里亚不把手伸给他，同意做他的妻子，他无论如何也不会忏悔。只有基特里亚同意了，他才可能改变主意，才有气力忏悔。\n 唐吉诃德听了巴西利奥的请求后，高声说他的请求合情合理，而且可行；无论是把基特里亚作为英雄巴西利奥的遗孀娶过来，还是把她从她父母身边直接娶过来，卡马乔都同样体面。\n “这里只是一句‘愿意’的问题，并不会有任何实际效果，因为在这种情况下，巴西利奥的婚礼只能是他的葬礼了。”\n 卡马乔听了此话，惶惶然不知如何说以及如何做才好。可是，巴西利奥的朋友们却七嘴八舌地要求卡马乔同意基特里亚把手伸给巴西利奥，做巴西利奥的妻子，以便这个在绝望中轻生的灵魂得到安慰。卡马乔一方面动了恻隐之心，另一方面也是迫不得已，说只要基特里亚愿意，他也同意，因为这不过是把自己的婚礼推迟一会儿的问题。\n 大家又围到基特里亚身旁。有的人再三请求，有的人以泪代言，有的人以理力争，劝她把手伸给可怜的巴西利奥。基特里亚一动不动，呆若木鸡，好像她不知道、不能够也不愿意答话似的。若不是神甫说她得马上决定到底怎么办，巴西利奥已经奄奄一息，容不得她再犹豫不决，恐怕基特里亚仍然会默不作声。\n 这样，美女基特里才一言不发、心烦意乱而且看起来似乎有些忧伤地来到巴西利奥身旁。此时巴西利奥已眼睛上翻，呼吸急促，但仍在不断地念叨基特里亚的名字，看来他等不及做忏悔就会死去。基特里亚走过来跪在巴西利奥身边，没有说话，只是示意巴西利奥把手伸出来。\n 巴西利奥睁大了眼睛，仔细看着她，说道：\n “基特里亚，你这时才动了同情心，可是你的同情心现在只能是一把结束我的生命的匕首。我现在已经无力接受你同意嫁给我的荣耀，也无法驱除由于死亡幽灵即将合上我的眼睛而带来的痛苦了。我恳求你，我的灾星，不要为了应付我，也不要为了再次欺骗我，才让我伸出手来，并且把你的手也伸给我；我要你承认，你是心甘情愿地把手伸给我的，同意我做你的合法丈夫。在这种时刻，你再骗我，或者以虚情假意来对待我对你的一片真心，就毫无道理了。”\n 巴西利奥说着就昏了过去，在场的人都以为巴西利奥这回已魂归西天了。基特里亚郑重而又羞愧地用自己的右手抓住巴西利奥的右手，对他说道：\n “任何力量都无法扭转我的意志。我心甘情愿地把我的右手伸给你，愿意做你的妻子，也接受你心甘情愿地伸来的右手，只要这个突如其来的意外并没有扰乱你的意识。”\n “我把手伸给你。”巴西利奥说，“我并没有糊涂，而且老天照应，我的意识非常清楚。我把手伸给你，愿意做你的丈夫。”\n “我愿意做你的妻子，”基特里亚说，“无论你寿比南山，还是就在我的怀抱里魂归西天。”\n “这个小伙子受了那么重的伤，怎么还说那么多的话？”桑乔这时说，“别再让他卿卿我我了，先保重自己的灵魂吧。我觉得他现在光顾得说了。”\n 巴西利奥和基特里亚的手拉到了一起。神父不禁动情，潸然泪下，为他们祝福，祈求老天让新郎的灵魂得以安息。这位新郎刚受到祝福，就马上很轻松地站了起来，带着一种不易察觉的狡黠拔出了自己体内的剑。在场的人都很惊奇。有几个好奇心盛的人没有多想就喊起来：\n “奇迹！真是奇迹！”\n 可是巴西利奥却说道：\n “不是奇迹，而是巧计。”\n 神甫莫名其妙，立刻用双手扒开巴西利奥的伤口察看，发现原来并没有刺破巴西利奥的肉和骨头，只是刺破了巴西利奥准备的一支铁管。铁管里装满了血，放在一个合适的位置上。据后来所知，巴西利奥进行了精心配制，所以血不会凝固。\n 于是神甫、卡马乔和其他所有在场的人都感到被愚弄了。基特里亚却并不为这场闹剧难过；相反，当她听说这婚姻是骗局，因而无效时，却再次声明自己愿意同巴西利奥结婚。大家断定这是两人精心策划的骗局。卡马乔和他的那些人愤怒至极，拔出剑向巴西利奥冲去，要找他算帐。可是，马上又有很多人出来帮助巴西利奥。这时，唐吉诃德手持长矛，用盾挡着自己的身体，一马当先冲了出来。大家忙为唐吉诃德让出一块地方。桑乔对这种争斗之事从来不感兴趣。。刚才他从大坛子里尝到了美味，现在他又跑到大坛子旁边，把那儿看得像圣地似的。唐吉诃德大声说道：\n “且慢，诸位大人，为爱情失意而进行报复是没有道理的。爱情同战争一样。在战争中，利用计谋战胜敌人是合法而且常用的办法。同样，在爱情的竞争中，也可以把善意的计谋用作达到自己预期的目标的一种手段，只要它不损害他们所爱的人的名誉就行。基特里亚属于巴西利奥，巴西利奥属于基特里亚，这是天意的合理安排。卡马乔很富裕，他随时随地都可以随意买到自己喜欢的东西。而巴西利奥只剩下一只羊了，任何人，不管他的势力有多大，也不应该夺走他这只羊。上帝把两个人安排在一起，那么，任何人也不应该把他们分开。谁如果想把他们分开，那就首先尝尝我的矛头吧。”\n 说完，唐吉诃德用力而又灵巧地挥舞起手中的长矛，使那些初识他的人大惊失色。卡马乔刚才一时忘了基特里亚的存在，现在才想起自己已被基特里亚抛弃，仍然耿耿于怀。神甫是个办事谨慎、心地善良的人。卡马乔听从了神甫的劝告，连同他的人一起平静下来，把他们的剑都放回了原处。此时他们并不在意巴西利奥的计谋，只是埋怨基特里亚轻率。卡马乔心想，基特里亚还没出嫁就那么爱巴西利奥，现在同巴西利奥结了婚，就会更加爱他。应该感谢上帝没有把基特里亚给他，而是把她从自己身边夺走了。\n 卡马乔和他这边的人都安静下来，巴西利奥那边的人也都不说话了。富豪卡马乔为了表示自己对这场闹剧并不介意，就想让婚礼继续举行下去，只当是他在结婚一样。不过，巴西利奥和基特里亚以及他们的那些人却不想这样举行婚礼，就回巴西利奥的村子去了。有钱人能受到一些人的阿谀奉承，品德高尚、头脑机敏的穷人同样也会有人追随、敬重和保护。\n 巴西利奥那些人觉得唐吉诃德有胆有识，就邀请唐吉诃德随他们回自己的村子去。只有桑乔怏怏不乐，他本来期待着卡马乔那丰盛的宴请，据说那天的宴请后来一直持续到晚上。桑乔跟在与巴西利奥那些人同行的主人后面，闷头赶路，虽然心中念念不忘，也只好把豪华安逸远远抛到身后，这指的是他那锅差不多吃完了的鸡和鹅。桑乔现在虽然不饿了，心中却仍然不快，只是若有所思地骑着驴，跟在罗西南多后面。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4642.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
