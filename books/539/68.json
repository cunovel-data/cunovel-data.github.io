{"id":42208,"no":68,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 14","content":"Among the things that passed between Don Quixote and the Knight of the Wood, the history tells us he of the Grove said to Don Quixote, “In fine, sir knight, I would have you know that my destiny, or, more properly speaking, my choice led me to fall in love with the peerless Casildea de Vandalia. I call her peerless because she has no peer, whether it be in bodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty. This same Casildea, then, that I speak of, requited my honourable passion and gentle aspirations by compelling me, as his stepmother did Hercules, to engage in many perils of various sorts, at the end of each promising me that, with the end of the next, the object of my hopes should be attained; but my labours have gone on increasing link by link until they are past counting, nor do I know what will be the last one that is to be the beginning of the accomplishment of my chaste desires. On one occasion she bade me go and challenge the famous giantess of Seville, La Giralda by name, who is as mighty and strong as if made of brass, and though never stirring from one spot, is the most restless and changeable woman in the world. I came, I saw, I conquered, and I made her stay quiet and behave herself, for nothing but north winds blew for more than a week. Another time I was ordered to lift those ancient stones, the mighty bulls of Guisando, an enterprise that might more fitly be entrusted to porters than to knights. Again, she bade me fling myself into the cavern of Cabra — an unparalleled and awful peril — and bring her a minute account of all that is concealed in those gloomy depths. I stopped the motion of the Giralda, I lifted the bulls of Guisando, I flung myself into the cavern and brought to light the secrets of its abyss; and my hopes are as dead as dead can be, and her scorn and her commands as lively as ever. To be brief, last of all she has commanded me to go through all the provinces of Spain and compel all the knights-errant wandering therein to confess that she surpasses all women alive to-day in beauty, and that I am the most valiant and the most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of which claim I have already travelled over the greater part of Spain, and have there vanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me; but what I most plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combat that so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made him confess that my Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in this one victory I hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the world; for this Don Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and I having vanquished him, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passed and are transferred to my person; for\n The more the vanquished hath of fair renown, The greater glory gilds the victor’s crown.\n Thus the innumerable achievements of the said Don Quixote are now set down to my account and have become mine.”\n Don Quixote was amazed when he heard the Knight of the Grove, and was a thousand times on the point of telling him he lied, and had the lie direct already on the tip of his tongue; but he restrained himself as well as he could, in order to force him to confess the lie with his own lips; so he said to him quietly, “As to what you say, sir knight, about having vanquished most of the knights of Spain, or even of the whole world, I say nothing; but that you have vanquished Don Quixote of La Mancha I consider doubtful; it may have been some other that resembled him, although there are few like him.”\n “How! not vanquished?” said he of the Grove; “by the heaven that is above us I fought Don Quixote and overcame him and made him yield; and he is a man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, with hair turning grey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large black drooping moustaches; he does battle under the name of ‘The Countenance,’ and he has for squire a peasant called Sancho Panza; he presses the loins and rules the reins of a famous steed called Rocinante; and lastly, he has for the mistress of his will a certain Dulcinea del Toboso, once upon a time called Aldonza Lorenzo, just as I call mine Casildea de Vandalia because her name is Casilda and she is of Andalusia. If all these tokens are not enough to vindicate the truth of what I say, here is my sword, that will compel incredulity itself to give credence to it.”\n “Calm yourself, sir knight,” said Don Quixote, “and give ear to what I am about to say to you. you.I would have you know that this Don Quixote you speak of is the greatest friend I have in the world; so much so that I may say I regard him in the same light as my own person; and from the precise and clear indications you have given I cannot but think that he must be the very one you have vanquished. On the other hand, I see with my eyes and feel with my hands that it is impossible it can have been the same; unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who are enchanters, and one in particular who is always persecuting him, some one of these may have taken his shape in order to allow himself to be vanquished, so as to defraud him of the fame that his exalted achievements as a knight have earned and acquired for him throughout the known world. And in confirmation of this, I must tell you, too, that it is but ten hours since these said enchanters his enemies transformed the shape and person of the fair Dulcinea del Toboso into a foul and mean village lass, and in the same way they must have transformed Don Quixote; and if all this does not suffice to convince you of the truth of what I say, here is Don Quixote himself, who will maintain it by arms, on foot or on horseback or in any way you please.”\n And so saying he stood up and laid his hand on his sword, waiting to see what the Knight of the Grove would do, who in an equally calm voice said in reply, “Pledges don’t distress a good payer; he who has succeeded in vanquishing you once when transformed, Sir Don Quixote, may fairly hope to subdue you in your own proper shape; but as it is not becoming for knights to perform their feats of arms in the dark, like highwaymen and bullies, let us wait till daylight, that the sun may behold our deeds; and the conditions of our combat shall be that the vanquished shall be at the victor’s disposal, to do all that he may enjoin, provided the injunction be such as shall be becoming a knight.”\n “I am more than satisfied with these conditions and terms,” replied Don Quixote; and so saying, they betook themselves to where their squires lay, and found them snoring, and in the same posture they were in when sleep fell upon them. They roused them up, and bade them get the horses ready, as at sunrise they were to engage in a bloody and arduous single combat; at which intelligence Sancho was aghast and thunderstruck, trembling for the safety of his master because of the mighty deeds he had heard the squire of the Grove ascribe to his; but without a word the two squires went in quest of their cattle; for by this time the three horses and the ass had smelt one another out, and were all together.\n On the way, he of the Grove said to Sancho, “You must know, brother, that it is the custom with the fighting men of Andalusia, when they are godfathers in any quarrel, not to stand idle with folded arms while their godsons fight; I say so to remind you that while our masters are fighting, we, too, have to fight, and knock one another to shivers.”\n “That custom, sir squire,” replied Sancho, “may hold good among those bullies and fighting men you talk of, but certainly not among the squires of knights-errant; at least, I have never heard my master speak of any custom of the sort, and he knows all the laws of knight-errantry by heart; but granting it true that there is an express law that squires are to fight while their masters are fighting, I don’t mean to obey it, but to pay the penalty that may be laid on peacefully minded squires like myself; for I am sure it cannot be more than two pounds of wax, and I would rather pay that, for I know it will cost me less than the lint I shall be at the expense of to mend my head, which I look upon as broken and split already; there’s another thing that makes it impossible for me to fight, that I have no sword, for I never carried one in my life.”\n “I know a good remedy for that,” said he of the Grove; “I have here two linen bags of the same size; you shall take one, and I the other, and we will fight at bag blows with equal arms.”\n “If that’s the way, so be it with all my heart,” said Sancho, “for that sort of battle will serve to knock the dust out of us instead of hurting us.”\n “That will not do,” said the other, “for we must put into the bags, to keep the wind from blowing them away, half a dozen nice smooth pebbles, all of the same weight; and in this way we shall be able to baste one another without doing ourselves any harm or mischief.”\n “Body of my father!” said Sancho, “see what marten and sable, and pads of carded cotton he is putting into the bags, that our heads may not be broken and our bones beaten to jelly! But even if they are filled with toss silk, I can tell you, senor, I am not going to fight; let our masters fight, that’s their lookout, and let us drink and live; for time will take care to ease us of our lives, without our going to look for fillips so that they may be finished off before their proper time comes and they drop from ripeness.”\n “Still,” returned he of the Grove, “we must fight, if it be only for half an hour.”\n “By no means,” said Sancho; “I am not going to be so discourteous or so ungrateful as to have any quarrel, be it ever so small, with one I have eaten and drunk with; besides, who the devil could bring himself to fight in cold blood, without anger or provocation?”\n “I can remedy that entirely,” said he of the Grove, “and in this way: before we begin the battle, I will come up to your worship fair and softly, and give you three or four buffets, with which I shall stretch you at my feet and rouse your anger, though it were sleeping sounder than a dormouse.”\n “To match that plan,” said Sancho, “I have another that is not a whit behind it; I will take a cudgel, and before your worship comes near enough to waken my anger I will send yours so sound to sleep with whacks, that it won’t waken unless it be in the other world, where it is known that I am not a man to let my face be handled by anyone; let each look out for the arrow — though the surer way would be to let everyone’s anger sleep, for nobody knows the heart of anyone, and a man may come for wool and go back shorn; God gave his blessing to peace and his curse to quarrels; if a hunted cat, surrounded and hard pressed, turns into a lion, God knows what I, who am a man, may turn into; and so from this time forth I warn you, sir squire, that all the harm and mischief that may come of our quarrel will be put down to your account.”\n “Very good,” said he of the Grove; “God will send the dawn and we shall be all right.”\n And now gay-plumaged birds of all sorts began to warble in the trees, and with their varied and gladsome notes seemed to welcome and salute the fresh morn that was beginning to show the beauty of her countenance at the gates and balconies of the east, shaking from her locks a profusion of liquid pearls; in which dulcet moisture bathed, the plants, too, seemed to shed and shower down a pearly spray, the willows distilled sweet manna, the fountains laughed, the brooks babbled, the woods rejoiced, and the meadows arrayed themselves in all their glory at her coming. But hardly had the light of day made it possible to see and distinguish things, when the first object that presented itself to the eyes of Sancho Panza was the squire of the Grove’s nose, which was so big that it almost overshadowed his whole body. It is, in fact, stated, that it was of enormous size, hooked in the middle, covered with warts, and of a mulberry colour like an egg-plant; it hung down two fingers’ length below his mouth, and the size, the colour, the warts, and the bend of it, made his face so hideous, that Sancho, as he looked at him, began to tremble hand and foot like a child in convulsions, and he vowed in his heart to let himself be given two hundred buffets, sooner than be provoked to fight that monster. Don Quixote examined his adversary, and found that he already had his helmet on and visor lowered, so that he could not see his face; he observed, however, that he was a sturdily built man, but not very tall in stature. Over his armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of what seemed to be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glittering mirrors like little moons, which gave him an extremely gallant and splendid appearance; above his helmet fluttered a great quantity of plumes, green, yellow, and white, and his lance, which was leaning against a tree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more than a palm in length.\n Don Quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he saw and observed he concluded that the said knight must be a man of great strength, but he did not for all that give way to fear, like Sancho Panza; on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he said to the Knight of the Mirrors, “If, sir knight, your great eagerness to fight has not banished your courtesy, by it I would entreat you to raise your visor a little, in order that I may see if the comeliness of your countenance corresponds with that of your equipment.”\n “Whether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sir knight,” replied he of the Mirrors, “you will have more than enough time and leisure to see me; and if now I do not comply with your request, it is because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong to the fair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raise my visor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware I maintain.”\n “Well then,” said Don Quixote, “while we are mounting you can at least tell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said you vanquished.”\n “To that we answer you,” said he of the Mirrors, “that you are as like the very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say enchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whether you are the said person or not.”\n “That,” said Don Quixote, “is enough to convince me that you are under a deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses be brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor, if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see your face, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you take me to be.”\n With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixote wheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge back upon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but Don Quixote had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by the other, and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him, “Remember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the vanquished, as I said before, shall be at the victor’s disposal.”\n “I am aware of it already,” said Don Quixote; “provided what is commanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not transgress the limits of chivalry.”\n “That is understood,” replied he of the Mirrors.\n At this moment the extraordinary nose of the squire presented itself to Don Quixote’s view, and he was no less amazed than Sancho at the sight; insomuch that he set him down as a monster of some kind, or a human being of some new species or unearthly breed. Sancho, seeing his master retiring to run his course, did not like to be left alone with the nosy man, fearing that with one flap of that nose on his own the battle would be all over for him and he would be left stretched on the ground, either by the blow or with fright; so he ran after his master, holding on to Rocinante’s stirrup-leather, and when it seemed to him time to turn about, he said, “I implore of your worship, senor, before you turn to charge, to help me up into this cork tree, from which I will be able to witness the gallant encounter your worship is going to have with this knight, more to my taste and better than from the ground.”\n “It seems to me rather, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “that thou wouldst mount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger.”\n “To tell the truth,” returned Sancho, “the monstrous nose of that squire has filled me with fear and terror, and I dare not stay near him.”\n “It is,” said Don Quixote, “such a one that were I not what I am it would terrify me too; so, come, I will help thee up where thou wilt.”\n While Don Quixote waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree he of the Mirrors took as much ground as he considered requisite, and, supposing Don Quixote to have done the same, without waiting for any sound of trumpet or other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse, which was not more agile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at his top speed, which was an easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy; seeing him, however, engaged in putting Sancho up, he drew rein, and halted in mid career, for which his horse was very grateful, as he was already unable to go. Don Quixote, fancying that his foe was coming down upon him flying, drove his spurs vigorously into Rocinante’s lean flanks and made him scud along in such style that the history tells us that on this occasion only was he known to make something like running, for on all others it was a simple trot with him; and with this unparalleled fury he bore down where he of the Mirrors stood digging his spurs into his horse up to buttons, without being able to make him stir a finger’s length from the spot where he had come to a standstill in his course. At this lucky moment and crisis, Don Quixote came upon his adversary, in trouble with his horse, and embarrassed with his lance, which he either could not manage, or had no time to lay in rest. Don Quixote, however, paid no attention to these difficulties, and in perfect safety to himself and without any risk encountered him of the Mirrors with such force that he brought him to the ground in spite of himself over the haunches of his horse, and with so heavy a fall that he lay to all appearance dead, not stirring hand or foot. The instant Sancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree, and made all haste to where his master was, who, dismounting from Rocinante, went and stood over him of the Mirrors, and unlacing his helmet to see if he was dead, and to give him air if he should happen to be alive, he saw — who can say what he saw, without filling all who hear it with astonishment, wonder, and awe? He saw, the history says, the very countenance, the very face, the very look, the very physiognomy, the very effigy, the very image of the bachelor Samson Carrasco! As soon as he saw it he called out in a loud voice, “Make haste here, Sancho, and behold what thou art to see but not to believe; quick, my son, and learn what magic can do, and wizards and enchanters are capable of.”\n Sancho came up, and when he saw the countenance of the bachelor Carrasco, he fell to crossing himself a thousand times, and blessing himself as many more. All this time the prostrate knight showed no signs of life, and Sancho said to Don Quixote, “It is my opinion, senor, that in any case your worship should take and thrust your sword into the mouth of this one here that looks like the bachelor Samson Carrasco; perhaps in him you will kill one of your enemies, the enchanters.”\n “Thy advice is not bad,” said Don Quixote, “for of enemies the fewer the better;” and he was drawing his sword to carry into effect Sancho’s counsel and suggestion, when the squire of the Mirrors came up, now without the nose which had made him so hideous, and cried out in a loud voice, “Mind what you are about, Senor Don Quixote; that is your friend, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, you have at your feet, and I am his squire.”\n “And the nose?” said Sancho, seeing him without the hideous feature he had before; to which he replied, “I have it here in my pocket,” and putting his hand into his right pocket, he pulled out a masquerade nose of varnished pasteboard of the make already described; and Sancho, examining him more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice of amazement, “Holy Mary be good to me! Isn’t it Tom Cecial, my neighbour and gossip?”\n “Why, to be sure I am!” returned the now unnosed squire; “Tom Cecial I am, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I’ll tell you presently the means and tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; but in the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch, maltreat, wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has at his feet; because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelor Samson Carrasco, our fellow townsman.”\n At this moment he of the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote perceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and said to him, “You are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in beauty; and in addition to this you must promise, if you should survive this encounter and fall, to go to the city of El Toboso and present yourself before her on my behalf, that she deal with you according to her good pleasure; and if she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like manner to return and seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you as a guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell me what may have passed between you and her — conditions which, in accordance with what we stipulated before our combat, do not transgress the just limits of knight-errantry.”\n “I confess,” said the fallen knight, “that the dirty tattered shoe of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the ill-combed though clean beard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to return from her presence to yours, and to give you a full and particular account of all you demand of me.”\n “You must also confess and believe,” added Don Quixote, “that the knight you vanquished was not and could not be Don Quixote of La Mancha, but some one else in his likeness, just as I confess and believe that you, though you seem to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are not so, but some other resembling him, whom my enemies have here put before me in his shape, in order that I may restrain and moderate the vehemence of my wrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory.”\n “I confess, hold, and think everything to be as you believe, hold, and think it,” the crippled knight; “let me rise, I entreat you; if, indeed, the shock of my fall will allow me, for it has left me in a sorry plight enough.”\n Don Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire Tom Cecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he put questions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was really and truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made on Sancho’s mind by what his master said about the enchanters having changed the face of the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the bachelor Samson Carrasco, would not permit him to believe what he saw with his eyes. In fine, both master and man remained under the delusion; and, down in the mouth, and out of luck, he of the Mirrors and his squire parted from Don Quixote and Sancho, he meaning to go look for some village where he could plaster and strap his ribs. Don Quixote and Sancho resumed their journey to Saragossa, and on it the history leaves them in order that it may tell who the Knight of the Mirrors and his long-nosed squire were.\n \n 唐吉诃德和森林骑士谈了很多。据故事记述，森林骑士对唐吉诃德讲道：\n “总之，骑士大人，我想让您知道，我受命运驱使，或者说由我自己选择，我爱上了举世无双的班达利亚的卡西尔德亚。说她举世无双，是因为无论比身高、比地位或是比相貌，都没有人能够与她相比。这个卡西尔德亚对我善意的想法和适度的愿望答以各种各样的危险差使，就像赫拉克勒斯的教母对赫拉克勒斯那样，每次都答应我，只要做完这件事后再做一件就可以满足我的愿望。可是事情做了一件又一件，我也不知道究竟做了多少件，究竟做完哪一件才能实现我的美好愿望。有一次，她派我去向塞维利亚那个有名的女巨人希拉尔达①挑战。希拉尔达非常勇敢，她仿佛是青铜铸的，屹立在原地寸步不移，但她却又是世界上最轻浮、最易变的女人。我赶到那儿，看见了她，打败了她，让她老老实实地站在那儿，不敢乱动，要知道当时刮了一个多星期的北风呢。后来，她又让我去称两只巨大的吉桑多公牛石像的重量。这种活更适合脚夫干，而不适合骑士干。\n ①此处提到的希拉尔达是著名的塞维利亚大教堂塔楼上的一尊青铜女神像。塔楼因此被称为希拉尔达塔楼。\n “还有一次，她让我跳进卡夫拉深渊，那可是空前可怕的事情哟。她要我把那黑洞深处的东西都给她拿上来。我制服了希拉尔达，我称了吉桑多公牛的重量，我又跳进深渊，把埋藏在深渊底部的东西都拿了上来，可是我的愿望仍然不能实现，而她的命令和嘲弄却没完没了。后来，她又命令我游历西班牙的所有省份，让各地所有的游侠骑士都承认只有她是最漂亮的，而我则是世界上最勇敢最多情的骑士。我按照她的要求游历了西班牙大部分省份，打败了所有胆敢对我持异议的人。不过，最令我自豪的是我在一次激烈的战斗中打败了曼查的著名骑士唐吉诃德，让他承认了我的卡西尔德亚比他的杜尔西内亚还漂亮。只此一举，我就可以说已打败了世界上的所有骑士，因为我说的那个唐吉诃德已经打败了所有骑士，而我又打败了他，那么他的光荣、名声和赞誉也就都转到了我的头上。\n 败者越有名，\n 胜者越光荣。\n 就这样，原来记在唐吉诃德身上的无数丰功伟绩都算到我身上了。”\n 唐吉诃德听了森林骑士这番话深感震惊。他多次想说森林骑士撒谎，话已经到了嘴边，可他还是强忍住了。他想让森林骑士自己承认是在撒谎。于是，唐吉诃德平静地对森林骑士说：\n “要说骑士大人您打败了西班牙的所有骑士，甚至是世界上的所有骑士，我都不想说什么；可要说您打败了曼查的唐吉诃德，我表示怀疑。很可能那是一个与唐吉诃德极其相似的人，尽管与他相似的人并不多。”\n “怎么会不可能呢？”森林骑士说，“我向高高在上的老天发誓，我是同唐吉诃德战斗，并且打败了他，俘虏了他。他高高的个子，干瘪脸，细长的四肢，花白头发，鹰鼻子还有点钩，黑黑的大胡子向下搭拉着。他还有个名字叫猥獕骑士，带着一个名叫桑乔的农夫当侍从。他骑的是一匹叫罗西南多的马，把托博索的杜尔西内亚当作自己的意中人。那女人原来叫阿尔东萨·洛伦索，就好比我的意中人叫卡西尔德亚，是安达卢西亚人，我就叫她班达利亚的卡西尔德亚那样。如果这些特征还不能证明我说的是真的，那么还有我的剑在此，它可以证明我说的确凿无疑。”\n “静一静，骑士大人，”唐吉诃德说，“您听我说。您该知道，您说的那个唐吉诃德是我在这个世界上的最好的朋友，可以说好得就像我就是他一样。您刚才说的那些特征说得很准确，但我并不能因此就认为您打败的那个人就是他本人。而且，就我本身的体验来说，也不可能是他本人，除非是他那许多魔法师冤家，而且其中有一个总是跟他过不去，变出了一个和他一样的人，把他打败，借此来诋毁他靠高尚的骑士行为在世界上赢得的声誉。为了证明这点，我还可以告诉您，就在两天前，他的魔法师冤家还把托博索的杜尔西内亚这个美人变成了粗野低下的农妇模样。这些魔法师同样也可以变出一个唐吉诃德来。如果这些还不足以让您相信我说的是真话，那么，唐吉诃德本人就在你眼前，无论是徒步还是骑马，他将以他的武器或者其他任何您认为合适的方式来证明这一点。”\n 说着唐吉诃德站了起来，手按剑柄，等着森林骑士的决定。可是，森林骑士不慌不忙地说道：\n “您真是站着说话不腰疼。唐吉诃德大人，既然我能够打败变成您这个模样的人，也完全可能打败您本人。不过，骑士战斗最好不在暗处，就像那些强盗无赖一样。咱们最好等太阳出来了再比试，而且咱们比试还应该有个条件，那就是输者以后得听赢者的，让他干什么就得干什么，只要不辱没他的骑士身份。”\n “我赞成这个条件和约定。”唐吉诃德说。\n 两人说完就去找自己的侍从。两个侍从自入睡以后一直鼾声不停。两人把侍从叫醒，让他们分头去备马，等太阳一出来，就要进行一场殊死非凡的战斗。桑乔一听这话吓坏了，他为主人的安全担忧，因为他已从森林骑士的侍从那里耳闻了森林骑士的勇猛。不过，两个侍从什么也没说，就去寻找自己的马。那三匹马和一头驴早已凑在一起互相嗅呢。\n 森林骑士的侍从在路上对桑乔说：\n “知道吗，兄弟？在安达卢西亚，决斗有个规矩，那就是如果教父们发生决斗，教子们也不能闲着，也得打。我这是想提醒您，咱们的主人决斗时，咱们俩也得打得皮开肉绽。”\n “侍从大人，”桑乔说，“这个规矩在您说的那些强盗恶棍当中或许还行得通，可对于游侠骑士的侍从就休想。至少我没听我的主人讲过这个规矩，而游侠骑士界的所有规定他都能背下来。就算这是真的，明确规定了在侍从的主人决斗时侍从也必须互相打，我也不执行，我宁可接受对不愿打斗的侍从的处罚。我估计也就不过是罚两磅蜡烛罢了。我倒更愿意出那两磅蜡烛。我知道买蜡烛的钱要比买纱布包头的钱少得多，如果打起来准得把脑袋打破了。还有，就是我没有剑，不能打。我这辈子从来没拿过剑。”\n “我倒有个好办法。”森林骑士的侍从说，“我这儿有两个大小一样的麻袋，您拿一个，我拿一个，咱们以同样的武器对打。”\n “这样也好，”桑乔说，“这样来回掸土要比受伤强。”\n “不能这样。”另一个侍从说，“麻袋里还得装五六个光溜溜的漂亮的卵石，否则扔不起来。两个麻袋一样重，这样咱们扔来扔去也下会伤着谁。”\n “我的天啊！”桑乔说，“那咱们还得在麻袋里装上紫貂皮或者棉花团之类的东西，以免伤筋动骨。不过我告诉您，我的大人，你就是在麻袋里装满了蚕茧，我也不会打。咱们的主人愿意打就打吧，他们打他们的，咱们喝咱们的，过咱们的。到时候咱们都得死，所以没必要不等到时候就自己赶着去找死。”\n “即使这样，”森林骑士的侍从说，“咱们也得打半个钟头。”\n “不，”桑乔说，“我不会那么无礼，也不会那么忘恩负义，同人家一起吃喝过后又为一点儿小事找麻烦。更何况咱们现在既没动怒，也没发火，干吗像中了魔似的为打而打呢？”\n “对此我倒有个好办法。”森林骑士的侍从说，“在还没开始打之前，我先麻利地来到您身边，打您三四个嘴巴，把您打倒在我脚下，这样一来，就是再好的脾气也会发火的。”\n “这种办法我也会，”桑乔说，“而且决不次于您。我可以拿根棍子，不等您勾起我的火来，我就用棍子先把您的火打闷了，让它这辈子都发不起来。这样我就可以让别人知道我可不是好欺负的。谁做事都得小心点儿，不过最好还是别动怒；别人的心思谁也搞不清，别偷鸡不成反蚀一把米。上帝祝福和平，诅咒战斗。兔子急了还会咬人呢，何况我是个人，谁知道我会变成什么样。所以，现在我就告诉您，侍从大人，咱们究竟打出什么恶果，您得好好考虑一下。”\n “好吧，”森林骑士的侍从说，“咱们还是天亮了再说吧。”\n 此时，无数种花色的小鸟已经开始在树林中啼鸣，它们欢快的叫声仿佛在向清秀的曙光女神祝福和问候。女神已经透过门窗和阳台，从东方露出了她美丽的脸庞，从她的头发上洒下无数的液体珍珠。小草沐浴着她的露水，仿佛又从自身产生出无数白色的细珠来。柳树分泌出甘露，泉水欢笑，小溪低吟，树林喜悦，草原也由于小溪的到来而变得肥沃。天色刚刚透亮，周围的一切依稀可见，但首先映入桑乔眼帘的却是森林骑士侍从的鼻子，那鼻子大得几乎把他的全身都遮盖住了。说实话，那鼻子真够大的，中部隆起，上面长满了肉赘，而且青紫得像茄子，鼻尖比嘴还低两指。这个鼻子的体积、颜色、肉赘和隆形使那个侍从的脸变得奇丑无比，桑乔见了就开始发抖，像小孩抽羊角风似的。他心里暗暗打算，宁愿让人打自己两百个嘴巴，也不愿动怒同这个妖怪作战。\n 唐吉诃德正在观察自己的对手。森林骑士已经戴好了头盔，所以看不到他的脸。但唐吉诃德可以从外观看出，他个子不高，身体却很结实。他在甲胄外面还披了一件战袍或外套，看样子是金丝的，上面缀满了闪闪发光的小镜片，显得威武而又华丽。他的头盔顶上还摆动着很多绿、黄、白色的羽毛，长矛靠在树上，锋利的铁头比巴掌还大。\n 唐吉诃德仔细观察之后，断定这个骑士的力气一定大得很。不过，他并没有像桑乔那样感到害怕，而是大大方方地对这位镜子骑士说：\n “假如您的战斗愿望并没有影响您的礼节，我请您把您的护眼罩掀起一点儿来，让我看看您的脸是否与您的打扮一样威武。”\n “无论您此次战胜还是战败，骑士大人，”镜子骑士说，“您都会有时间看我。我现在不能满足您的要求，因为我觉得在您没有承认我要求您承认的东西之前，掀起眼罩，耽误时间，便是对班达利亚美丽的卡西尔德亚的明显不恭。”\n “在咱们上马前，”唐吉诃德说，“您还可以告诉我，我到底是不是您说的那个被您打败的唐吉诃德。”\n “我对此的回答是，”镜子骑士说，“您同我打败的那个骑士如出一辙。不过，既然您说有魔法师跟你捣乱，我也就不能肯定您到底是不是那个骑士了。”\n “这足以让我相信您仍然执迷不悟了，”唐吉诃德说，“为了让您清醒清醒，还是叫咱们的马过来吧。如果上帝、我的夫人和我的臂膀保佑我，我马上就会让您掀起您的眼罩，让我看到您的面孔，您也就会知道，我并不是您想的那个唐吉诃德。”\n 于是两人不再争论，翻身上了马。唐吉诃德掉转罗西南多的辔头向相反的方向跑去，准备跑出一段路后再折回来冲杀。镜子骑士也同样向相反的方向跑去。不过，唐吉诃德还没跑出二十步，就听见镜子骑士在叫他。两人都转过身来，镜子骑士对唐吉诃德说：\n “骑士大人，请您记着，咱们搏斗有个条件，也就是我原来说过的，败者必须听从胜者的吩咐。”\n “这我知道，”唐吉诃德说，“只要胜者吩咐的事情不违反骑士界的规定。”\n “是这个意思。”镜子骑士说。\n 此时，唐吉诃德眼前出现了那个侍从少见的鼻子，把唐吉诃德吓了一跳，他被惊吓的程度并不次于桑乔。唐吉诃德以为那是个怪物，或者是世界上新发现的某个稀有人种。桑乔见主人已经开始助跑，不愿单独同大鼻子在一起，怕自己同那个侍从搏斗时，他用大鼻子一扒拉，就会把自己打倒或吓倒。于是，他抓着罗西南多鞍镫上的皮带，跟着主人，等到他认为主人该转身往回冲的时候对主人说：\n “求求您，我的主人，在您准备返身冲杀之前，帮助我爬到那棵栓皮槠树上去，在那儿我可以比在地上更津津有味地观看您同这位骑士的精彩搏斗。”\n “我倒是认为，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“你是想爬到高处去隔岸观火。”\n “您说得对，”桑乔说，“那个侍从的大鼻子可把我吓坏了，我不敢和他在一起。”\n “那鼻子是够吓人的，”唐吉诃德说，“要不是我胆大，也会被它吓坏了。既然这样，你过来，我帮你爬上去。”\n 就在唐吉诃德帮助桑乔往树上爬的时候，镜子骑士已经跑了他认为足够的距离。他以为唐吉诃德也同他一样跑够了距离。于是，他不等喇叭响或者其他信号，就掉转他那匹比罗西南多强不到哪儿去的马的辔头，飞奔起来。他刚跑了一半儿路，就遇到了自己的对手。他见唐吉诃德正帮着桑乔上树，便勒住缰绳，停了下来。他的马对此感激不已，因为它本来就跑不动了。唐吉诃德意识到对手正飞奔而来，立刻把马刺扎向罗西南多的瘦肋骨，催它跑起来。据故事说，只有这次它才算跑，其他时候都应该说是快步。它跑到镜子骑士跟前时，镜子骑士已经把马刺的整个尖头都刺进了马身里，可那匹马就是待在原地不动。马不动，长矛也没准备好，因为他的长矛仍放在矛托上。在这紧急关头，唐吉诃德已经冲了上来。唐吉诃德并没有发现对手所处的窘境，稳稳当当地用力向对手刺去，只见对手身不由己地从马背上摔到了地上，摔得手脚动弹不得，像死了一样。\n 桑乔见镜子骑士落地了，立刻从树上滑下来，跑到自己主人身边。这时唐吉诃德已跳下马，来到镜子骑士身旁，解开他头盔上的绳结，看他是否死了，想给他透透气，看他是否能活过来。可唐吉诃德看到的是……谁听说了会不惊奇呢？故事说，唐吉诃德看到的脸庞、脸型、脸面、脸色不是别人，正是参孙·卡拉斯科学士！唐吉诃德一见是他，便高声叫道：\n “快来，桑乔！你快过来看看，你肯定不会相信！你快点儿，伙计，你来看看魔法的本事，看看巫师和魔法师的本事吧。”\n 桑乔过来了。他一见是卡拉斯科的脸，连忙一个劲儿画十字。看样子那位落地的骑士已经死了。桑乔对唐吉诃德说：\n “依我看，我的主人，不管对不对，您先往这个貌似参孙·卡拉斯科学士的家伙嘴里插一剑，也许这一下就能杀死您的一个魔法师对手呢。”\n “此话不错，”唐吉诃德说，“对手越少越好。”\n 说完唐吉诃德就要动手，而镜子骑士的侍从跑了过来，此时他那难看的大鼻子也不见了。他大声喊道：\n “您要干什么，唐吉诃德大人，您脚下的那个人是您的朋友参孙·卡拉斯科学士，我就是他的侍从呀。”\n 桑乔见这张脸已经不那么可怕了，便问道：\n “你的鼻子呢？”\n 那个侍从答道：\n “放在我的衣袋里了。”\n 说着他把手伸向右边衣袋，拿出了一个用纸板做的用漆涂过的面具，其相貌前面已经描述过了。桑乔仔细地看了看那个人，惊奇地高声说道：\n “圣母保佑！这不是邻居老弟托梅·塞西亚尔吗？”\n “正是我，”那位已疲惫不堪的侍从说，“我就是托梅·塞西亚尔，桑乔的老友。待一会儿我再告诉你，我是如何上当受骗，迫不得已来到这儿的。现在我请求您，恳求您，不要碰、不要虐待、不要伤害、不要杀死镜子骑士，他确实是咱们的同乡，是勇敢却又处世不慎的参孙·卡拉斯科学士。”\n 此时镜子骑士已经苏醒过来。唐吉诃德看见了，把剑尖放在他脸上，对他说：\n “骑士，如果你不承认托博索举世无双的杜尔西内亚比你那位班达利亚的卡西尔德亚强，我就杀死你。此外，如果经过这场战斗你能活下来，你还得答应我到托博索城去，代表我去拜见她，听候她的吩咐。如果她让你自己决定，你还得回来找我，把遇见她的情况告诉我。我所做出的丰功伟绩到处都会留下踪迹，你沿着这些踪迹就可以找到我。这些条件都是根据咱们在战前的约定提出的，而且没有违犯游侠骑士的规定。”\n “我承认，托博索的杜尔西内亚夫人的开了绽的破鞋子也比卡西尔德亚干净，比她那梳理杂乱的毛发贵重。我答应去拜见您那位夫人，回来后按照您的要求，把情况向您如实汇报。”\n “你还得承认和相信，”唐吉诃德说，“你战胜的那个骑士，不是也不可能是曼查的唐吉诃德，而是另一个与他相像的人，就像我承认并且相信你不是参孙·卡拉斯科学士一样。虽然你很像他，但你只是个与他很相像的人。是我的敌人把你变成了这个样子，以便遏制和缓解我的斗志，盗用我战无不胜的美名。”\n “您怎么认为、怎么认定、怎么感觉，我就怎么承认、怎么认定、怎么感觉，”在地上动弹不得的骑士说，“只要我还能站起来。求求您，先让我站起来吧。您把我打翻在地，把我伤得真不轻。”\n 唐吉诃德把他扶了起来，而桑乔却一直盯着托梅·塞西亚尔，问了他一些事情，而他的回答证明他确实就是托梅·塞西亚尔。不过，唐吉诃德坚持认为是魔法师把镜子骑士变成了参孙·卡拉斯科学士的模样，对桑乔产生了影响，使桑乔对自己亲眼见到的事实也不敢相信了。最后，唐吉诃德和桑乔仍然坚持己见，垂头丧气的镜子骑士和侍从只得离开了唐吉诃德和桑乔，想到附近某个地方去上点儿药膏，把断骨接好。唐吉诃德和桑乔继续向萨拉戈萨赶路，故事对此暂且按下不表，先来谈镜子骑士和他的大鼻子侍从究竟是什么人。\n
