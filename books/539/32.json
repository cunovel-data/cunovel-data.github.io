Surely thou didst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in gold thread for this her enslaved knight.” “I did not,” said Sancho, “but I found her winnowing two bushels of wheat in the yard of her house.” “Then depend upon it,” said Don Quixote, “the grains of that wheat were pearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look, friend? was it white wheat or brown?” “It was neither, but red,” said Sancho. “Then I promise thee,” said Don Quixote, “that, winnowed by her hands, beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; when thou gavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on her head? Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?” “When I went to give it to her,” replied Sancho, “she was hard at it swaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, and she said to me, ‘Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for I cannot read it until I have done sifting all this.” “Discreet lady!” said Don Quixote; “that was in order to read it at her leisure and enjoy it; proceed, Sancho; while she was engaged in her occupation what converse did she hold with thee? What did she ask about me, and what answer didst thou give? Make haste; tell me all, and let not an atom be left behind in the ink-bottle.” “She asked me nothing,” said Sancho; “but I told her how your worship was left doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, in among these mountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not eating bread off a tablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing your fortune.” “In saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,” said Don Quixote; “for rather do I bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life for having made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as Dulcinea del Toboso.” “And so lofty she is,” said Sancho, “that she overtops me by more than a hand’s -breadth.” “What! Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “didst thou measure with her?” “I measured in this way,” said Sancho; “going to help her to put a sack of wheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that I could see she stood more than a good palm over me.” “Well!” said Don Quixote, “and doth she not of a truth accompany and adorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! But one thing thou wilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to her didst thou not perceive a Sabaean odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not what, delicious, that I cannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, an exhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?” “All I can say is,” said Sancho, “that I did perceive a little odour, something goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with hard work.” “It could not be that,” said Don Quixote, “but thou must have been suffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for I know well what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of the field, that dissolved amber.” “Maybe so,” replied Sancho; “there often comes from myself that same odour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady Dulcinea; but that’s no wonder, for one devil is like another.” “Well then,” continued Don Quixote, “now she has done sifting the corn and sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter?” “As for the letter,” said Sancho, “she did not read it, for she said she could neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into small pieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest her secrets should become known in the village, and that what I had told her by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and the extraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, to make an end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissed your hands, and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write to you; and that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight of this present, to come out of these thickets, and to have done with carrying on absurdities, and to set out at once for El Toboso, unless something else of greater importance should happen, for she had a great desire to see your worship. She laughed greatly when I told her how your worship was called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked her if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she told me he had, and that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about the galley slaves, but she said she had not seen any as yet.” “So far all goes well,” said Don Quixote; “but tell me what jewel was it that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of me? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich jewel as a guerdon for good news,’ and acknowledgment of the message.” “That is very likely,” said Sancho, “and a good custom it was, to my mind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to be the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that was what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I took leave of her; and more by token it was sheep’s -milk cheese.” “She is generous in the extreme,” said Don Quixote, “and if she did not give thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had not one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter; I shall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what amazes me, Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air, for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to El Toboso and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there. From which I am inclined to think that the sage magician who is my friend, and watches over my interests (for of necessity there is and must be one, or else I should not be a right knight-errant), that this same, I say, must have helped thee to travel without thy knowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a knight-errant sleeping in his bed, and without his knowing how or in what way it happened, he wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues away from the place where he went to sleep. And if it were not for this, knights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril, as they do at every turn. For a knight, maybe, is fighting in the mountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent, or another knight, and gets the worst of the battle, and is at the point of death; but when he least looks for it, there appears over against him on a cloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his, who just before had been in England, and who takes his part, and delivers him from death; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping very much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will have been two or three thousand leagues. And all this is done by the craft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant knights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that thou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such a short time, since, as I have said, some friendly sage must have carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it.” “That must have been it,” said Sancho, “for indeed Rocinante went like a gipsy’s ass with quicksilver in his ears.” “Quicksilver!” said Don Quixote, “aye and what is more, a legion of devils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being weary, exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what thinkest thou I ought to do about my lady’s command to go and see her? For though I feel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too that I am debarred by the boon I have accorded to the princess that accompanies us, and the law of chivalry compels me to have regard for my word in preference to my inclination; on the one hand the desire to see my lady pursues and harasses me, on the other my solemn promise and the glory I shall win in this enterprise urge and call me; but what I think I shall do is to travel with all speed and reach quickly the place where this giant is, and on my arrival I shall cut off his head, and establish the princess peacefully in her realm, and forthwith I shall return to behold the light that lightens my senses, to whom I shall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay, for she will see that it entirely tends to increase her glory and fame; for all that I have won, am winning, or shall win by arms in this life, comes to me of the favour she extends to me, and because I am hers.” “Ah! what a sad state your worship’s brains are in!” said Sancho. “Tell me, senor, do you mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to let slip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a portion a kingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more than twenty thousand leagues round about, and abounds with all things necessary to support human life, and is bigger than Portugal and Castile put together? Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what you have said, and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the first village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate who will do the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give advice, and this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good to his hand and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not come to him.” “Look here, Sancho,” said Don Quixote. “If thou art advising me to marry, in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become king, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have promised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without marrying; for before going into battle I will make it a stipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry, they shall give me a portion portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon whomsoever I choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestow it but upon thee?” “That is plain speaking,” said Sancho; “but let your worship take care to choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don’t like the life, I may be able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said; don’t mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this giant and let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it will be one of great honour and great profit.” “I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and I will take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to see Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to any one, or to those who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for as Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known it is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.” “Well then, if that be so,” said Sancho, “how is it that your worship makes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves before my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name to it that you love her and are her lover? And as those who go must perforce kneel before her and say they come from your worship to submit themselves to her, how can the thoughts of both of you be hid?” “O, how silly and simple thou art!” said Don Quixote; “seest thou not, Sancho, that this tends to her greater exaltation? For thou must know that according to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high honour to a lady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughts never go beyond serving her for her own sake, and who look for no other reward for their great and true devotion than that she should be willing to accept them as her knights.” “It is with that kind of love,” said Sancho, “I have heard preachers say we ought to love our Lord, for himself alone, without being moved by the hope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part, I would rather love and serve him for what he could do.” “The devil take thee for a clown!” said Don Quixote, “and what shrewd things thou sayest at times! One would think thou hadst studied.” “In faith, then, I cannot even read.” Master Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted to halt and drink at a little spring there was there. Don Quixote drew up, not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was by this time weary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching him tripping, for though he knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of El Toboso, he had never seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put on the clothes which Dorothea was wearing when they found her, and though they were not very good, they were far better than those he put off. They dismounted together by the side of the spring, and with what the curate had provided himself with at the inn they appeased, though not very well, the keen appetite they all of them brought with them. While they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing on his way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the next moment ran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs, began to weep freely, saying, “O, senor, do you not know me? Look at me well; I am that lad Andres that your worship released from the oak-tree where I was tied.” Don Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those present and said: “That your worships may see how important it is to have knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by tyrannical and wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days ago passing through a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of a person in pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my bounden duty, to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me to proceed, and I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before you, which in my heart I rejoice at, for his testimony will not permit me to depart from the truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to an oak, naked from the waist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found to be his master, was scarifying him by lashes with the reins of his mare. As soon as I saw him I asked the reason of so cruel a flagellation. The boor replied that he was flogging him because he was his servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather from dishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy said, ‘Senor, he flogs me only because I ask for my wages.’ The master made I know not what speeches and explanations, which, though I listened to them, I did not accept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him, and to swear he would take him with him, and pay him real by real, and perfumed into the bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst thou not mark with what authority I commanded him, and with what humility he promised to do all I enjoined, specified, and required of him? Answer without hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may see that it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant abroad.” “All that your worship has said is quite true,” answered the lad; “but the end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your worship supposes.” “How! the opposite?” said Don Quixote; “did not the clown pay thee then?” “Not only did he not pay me,” replied the lad, “but as soon as your worship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me up again to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a flayed Saint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up with some jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, and but for the pain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things he said. In short he left me in such a condition that I have been until now in a hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally clown inflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for if you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for you, nor meddled in other people’s affairs, my master would have been content with giving me one or two dozen lashes, and would have then loosed me and paid me what he owed me; but when your worship abused him so out of measure, and gave him so many hard words, his anger was kindled; and as he could not revenge himself on you, as soon as he saw you had left him the storm burst upon me in such a way, that I feel as if I should never be a man again.” “The mischief,” said Don Quixote, “lay in my going away; for I should not have gone until I had seen thee paid; because I ought to have known well by long experience that there is no clown who will keep his word if he finds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest, Andres, that I swore if he did not pay thee I would go and seek him, and find him though he were to hide himself in the whale’s belly.” “That is true,” said Andres; “but it was of no use.” “Thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not,” said Don Quixote; and so saying, he got up hastily and bade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who was browsing while they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he meant to do. He replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise him for such iniquitous conduct, and see Andres paid to the last maravedi, despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. To which she replied that he must remember that in accordance with his promise he could not engage in any enterprise until he had concluded hers; and that as he knew this better than anyone, he should restrain his ardour until his return from her kingdom. “That is true,” said Don Quixote, “and Andres must have patience until my return as you say, senora; but I once more swear and promise not to stop until I have seen him avenged and paid.” “I have no faith in those oaths,” said Andres; “I would rather have now something to help me to get to Seville than all the revenges in the world; if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give it me, and God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may their errands turn out as well for themselves as they have for me.” Sancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese, and giving them to the lad he said, “Here, take this, brother Andres, for we have all of us a share in your misfortune.” “Why, what share have you got?” “This share of bread and cheese I am giving you,” answered Sancho; “and God knows whether I shall feel the want of it myself or not; for I would have you know, friend, that we squires to knights-errant have to bear a great deal of hunger and hard fortune, and even other things more easily felt than told.” Andres seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave him anything more, bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the saying is. However, before leaving he said, “For the love of God, sir knight-errant, if you ever meet me again, though you may see them cutting me to pieces, give me no aid or succour, but leave me to my misfortune, which will not be so great but that a greater will come to me by being helped by your worship, on whom and all the knights-errant that have ever been born God send his curse.” Don Quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels at such a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightily chapfallen was Don Quixote at Andres’ story, and the others had to take great care to restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out of countenance. “我对此还算满意。你接着讲下去。”唐吉诃德说，“你到的时候，那个绝世美人正在干什么？肯定是在用金丝银线为我这个钟情于她的骑士穿珠子或绣标记吧。” “不是，”桑乔说，“我到的时候，她正在她家的院子里筛两个法内加的麦子。” “那么你一定注意到了，”唐吉诃德说，“那些麦粒一经她手，立刻变得粒粒如珍珠。你是否看清楚了，朋友，那是精白麦还是春麦？” “是荞麦。” “我敢肯定，”唐吉诃德说，“经她手筛出的麦子可以做出精白的面包。不过你接着说，你把我的信交给她时，她吻了信吗？把信放到头上了吗？有什么相应的礼仪吗？或者，她是怎么做的？” “我把信交给她的时候，”桑乔说，“她正用力摇动筛子里的一大堆麦子。她对我说，朋友，把信放在那个口袋里吧，她得把麦子全部筛完之后才能看信。” “多聪明的夫人啊！”唐吉诃德说，“她大概是为了慢慢品味这封信。你往下说，桑乔，她在忙她的活计时，跟你说话了吗？向你打听我的情况了吗？你是怎么回答的？你一下子都告诉我，一点儿也别遗漏。” “她什么也没问，”桑乔说，“不过我倒是对她讲了，您如何为了表示对她的忠心，正在山里苦心修行，光着上身，像个野人似的，眠不上床，食不近桌，不修边幅，边哭边诅咒自己的命运。” “你说我诅咒自己的命运就错了，”唐吉诃德说，“恰恰相反，我每天都在庆幸自己能够爱上高贵的托博索的杜尔西内亚夫人。” “她确实够高的，”桑乔说，“至少比我高一拃多。” “怎么，桑乔，”唐吉诃德问，“你同她比过身高？” “我是这样同她比的，”桑乔说，“我帮她把一袋麦子放到驴背上，凑巧站在一起，我发现她比我高一拃多。” “她其实没有那么高，”唐吉诃德说，“可是她数不尽的美德却使她楚楚动人！有件事你别瞒着我，桑乔，你站在她身边的时候，是不是闻到了一种萨巴人的味道，一种芳香或是其他什么高级东西的味道，我叫不出它的名称来。我是说，你是不是有一种置身于某个手套精品店的感觉？” “我只能说我感觉到的是一股男人的气味，”桑乔说，“大概是她干活太多、出汗也太多造成的气味，不太好闻。” “不会的，”唐吉诃德说，“大概是你感冒了，或者是你自己身上的气味。我知道她发出的是带刺灌木中的玫瑰、田野里的百合或者熔化了的琥珀发出的那种味道。” “这也可能，”桑乔说，“因为我身上常有那股味道，就把它当成您的杜尔西内亚夫人的味儿了。那种味儿并不一定就是从她身上发出的，这没什么可奇怪的。” “好吧，”唐吉诃德说，“她已经筛完了麦子，把麦子送到磨房去了。她看信的时候是什么样子？” “她没看信，”桑乔说，“她说她不识字，也不会写字。她把信撕成了碎片，说不愿意让别人看到信，不愿意让当地人知道这些秘密。她已经知道了我告诉她的您爱她，并且为她苦心修行就行了。最后她让我告诉您，说她吻您的手，她不想给您写信了，只想见到您。她让我请求您，命令您，如果没有其它更重要的事情，就离开那些杂草荆棘，别再折腾了，即刻上路回托博索吧，她非常想见到您。我告诉她您叫猥獕骑士时，她笑得可厉害了。我问她以前是否有比斯开人去过她那儿，她说去过，那是个挺善良的人。我还问她是否有苦役犯去过，她说至今没见过一个。” “一切都很顺利，”唐吉诃德说、“不过，你告诉我，既然你替我送了信，你离开她时，她给你什么首饰了？游侠骑士和夫人之间自古就有个习惯，无论是替骑士给夫人送信，还是替夫人给骑士送信，总要给那些送信的侍从、侍女或侏儒一件贵重的首饰做赏钱，感谢他们送信来。” “这完全可能，我觉得这是个好习惯。不过，这大概是过去的事情，现在恐怕只给一快面包或奶酪了。我们的杜尔西内亚夫人就是这样，我走的时候，她隔着院子的墙头给了我一块，说得具体点，是一块羊奶酪。” “她这个人非常随便，”唐吉诃德说，“如果她没给你金首饰，那肯定是因为她当时手边没有。不过，‘如愿虽晚却更好’。等我去跟她商量，一切问题都会得到解决。你知道什么事最让我惊奇吗，桑乔？我觉得你是飞去飞回的。因为你去托博索跑了一个来回，只用了三天多时间，可是从这儿到那儿有三十多里路呢。我估计准是有个很关心我、又对我很友好的魔法师帮助了你。肯定有这样的魔法师，也应该有，否则我就算不上优秀的游侠骑士了。我说呀，大概是这种人帮着你赶路，可是你自己却根本感觉不到。有的魔法师把正在床上睡觉的游侠骑士弄走了，连游侠骑士自己也不知道是怎么回事，第二天早晨醒来的时候，已经到了千里之外。 “如果不是这样，游侠骑士们就不能在危难时帮助别人。他们常常互相帮助。有时候，一个骑士在亚美尼亚的山里同一个怪物或野妖打斗，或者同别的骑士搏斗，情况紧急，眼看就要没命了，忽然，他的一位骑士朋友腾云驾雾或者驾着火焰战车出现了。他刚才还在英格兰，现在却突然来到，来帮助你，救你的命，晚上就在你的住处津津有味地吃晚饭了。两地之间常常相隔两三千里，这些全靠时刻关照勇敢骑士的魔法大师们的高超本领。所以，桑乔朋友，你在这么短的时间里就到托博索跑了一个来回，我没什么信不过的，就像我刚才说的，一定有某个魔法师朋友带着你腾飞，而你自己却一点儿也没有感觉到。” “大概是这样，”桑乔说，“罗西南多跑得矫健如飞，简直像吉卜赛人的驴。” “它矫健如飞，”唐吉诃德说，“因为有很多鬼怪簇拥着它呢。它们可以随心所欲地不间歇地跑路或者带着人跑路。不过，咱们暂且不说这些吧。我的夫人命令我去看她，你看我现在该怎么办呢？我虽然知道必须听从她的命令，可是又不能不履行我对那位与咱们同行的公主许下的诺言啊。骑士法则规定我必须履行诺言，不能由着自己的性子来。一方面，我对我的夫人望眼欲穿；另一方面，我答应的事情和我为此将得到的荣誉又使我欲罢不能。不过，我想，抓紧时间赶到那个巨人那儿，砍掉他的头，为公主重建太平，然后就立刻去看望那位给了我光明的宝贝。我会向她请求原谅。她会觉得我姗姗来迟是对的，因为她发现这增加了她的声誉。而我这一辈子，无论过去、现在和将来，凡是靠武力取得的声誉，全都是她保佑我、我忠于她的结果。” “唉，”桑乔说，“您的脑子真是有毛病了。请您告诉我，大人，您真想白跑一趟，放弃一门如此富贵的亲事吗？她有一个王国作嫁妆，而且我确实听说过，那个王国方圆两万里，里面人类生活所需的各种物品应有尽有，比葡萄牙和卡斯蒂利亚加起来的面积还要大。看在上帝份上，别再说什么了。您应该为您刚才说的话感到羞耻。听我的劝告，只要到了有神甫的地方，就赶紧结婚吧。或者，咱们这儿就有神甫，他能为您主持婚礼是再好不过了。您知道，我这个年龄，也有资格劝劝人了，而且我这个劝告对您很中肯。‘百鸟在天，不如一鸟在手’；‘弃善从严，咎由自取’。” “桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“假如你劝我结婚是为了等我杀死巨人后你可以得到赏赐，那么我可以告诉你，我即使不结婚，要让你如愿也很容易。我可以在进行战斗之前就讲明，如果打胜了，即使不结婚，也得把她的王国分一部分给我，让我随意赏人。一旦得到了那部分王国，你说，除了给你，我还能给谁呢？” “那当然。”桑乔说，“不过您得注意挑选离海近的地方。万一我对那儿的生活不满意，还可以把我管辖的黑人装上船，按照我以前说过的那样处理他们。您现在不必去看咱们的杜尔西内亚夫人，只须一心去杀那巨人，先把这件事了结。上帝保佑，我敢保证，这是件名利双收的事情。” “我说，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“你说得对，我会听从你的劝告，先跟公主走，而不是先去看杜尔西内亚。我得告诉你，桑乔，咱们刚才谈的事情，你对别人丝毫也不能透露，即使对与咱们同行的人也一样。杜尔西内亚是个谨慎的人，她不愿意让别人知道她的事情，所以，我或者其他人若是把她的事情说出去就不好了。” “如果这样，”桑乔说，“那么，您如何让所有被您打败的人去拜见咱们的杜尔西内亚夫人呢？那不就证明了您爱她，是她的情人吗？那些被迫前去的人必然得跪倒在她面前，说是受您差遣，前去听从她的吩咐，那么，你们俩的事怎么隐瞒得了呢？” “哎，你真是既愚蠢，又单纯！”唐吉诃德说，“你就不明白，桑乔，这是在抬高她的身价吗？你应该知道，在我们骑士看来，一位夫人有很多游侠骑士追求是很光荣的事情。骑士们追求她仅仅是为了追求而已。他们百般殷勤并无它求，只望她为自己有这么多骑士追求而高兴。” “我在听布道时听说过，我们对上帝就应该是这么个爱法。”桑乔说，“我们只求爱他，并不指望得到荣誉或者害怕受到惩罚。我倒是很愿意爱上帝，尽可能地为他效劳。” “你这个乡巴佬，”唐吉诃德说，“有时候说起话来倒挺聪明，好像还有点儿学问。” “可我确实不识字。”桑乔说。 这时，尼古拉斯师傅叫他们等一等，大家想在一股清泉那儿喝点水。唐吉诃德停了下来，桑乔也挺高兴。他对如此说谎话已经厌倦了，怕主人会抓住他什么话柄。他虽然知道杜尔西内亚是托博索的一个农家女，却从来没见过她的模样。 卡德尼奥这时已经换上了多罗特亚最初穿的那身衣服。衣服虽然不算很好，还是比他自己原来那身强多了。此时大家都已饥肠辘辘，便下马来到清泉边，以神甫在客店弄到的一点儿食物来充饥。 这时候，有个男孩子路过。他停住脚，仔细地看着清泉旁边这些人。忽然，男孩子奔向唐吉诃德，抱住他的腿，放声大哭，说道： “我的大人啊！您不认识我了吗？您仔细看看，我就是那个被捆在圣栎树上的孩子安德烈斯，是您解救了我呀。” 唐吉诃德也认出了他，于是拉着他的手，转身对大家说： “诸位请看，在这个世界上，游侠骑士是多么重要，是他们制止了世界上无耻恶棍为非作歹。我告诉你们，前几天，我从森林边路过，听见喊声和凄惨的叫声，好像有人在遭受痛苦。我出于责任感，向传来喊叫声的方向走去，发现有个孩子被捆在一棵圣栎树上。这个孩子现在就站在你们面前。我很高兴他在这里，因为他可以证明我所说的没有半句假话。他被捆在圣栎树上，上身裸露，一个农夫正在用马缰绳抽打他。后来我知道那是他的主人。我马上就问为什么抽打他。那个粗野的家伙说，这孩子是他的牧童，不仅笨，而且手脚不老实，办了错事。这孩子说：‘大人，他打我仅仅是因为我向他要工钱。’孩子的主人又说了一些话为自己辩解。我虽然都听到了，可没有相信。 “反正，最后我让农夫放了孩子，责令他必须一文不少地照付全部工资，而且要再加点钱。这都是真的吧，安德烈斯？你当时注意到了吗，我责令他的时候多么威风，他答应一切照办时多么唯唯诺诺！你说吧，没什么可顾虑的，把发生的事情告诉这几位大人，让他们知道有游侠骑士巡游是不是好事。” “您刚才讲的都很真实，”男孩子说，“不过事情的结局与您想象的大不一样。” “怎么回事？”唐吉诃德问，“难道那个农夫没付你工钱？” “不仅没付我工钱，”小伙子说，“而且，您刚刚离开树林，只剩下我们两人时，他就重新把我捆在那棵树上，又打起我来，把我打得遍体鳞伤。他每打一下，还说一句俏皮话嘲笑您。我要不是疼得厉害，恐怕也会笑起来。结果我被打得住进了医院，现在刚刚从医院出来。这都怨您。如果您赶自己的路，别顺着喊声过来，也别管别人的事情，我的主人打我几十下也就够了，然后他就会放开我，付给我应得的工钱。可您这一来，让他丢了脸，而且您还说了那么多难听的话，把他惹火了。可是他无法向您发作，于是就等剩下我们两人时拿我出气，我觉得这么一折腾，让我一辈子也抬不起头来了。” “问题就出在我没等他向你付工钱就离开了那儿。”唐吉诃德说，“而且，根据我多年的经验，我完全应该知道，这类乡下佬见到没人督促，就会自食其言。不过你还记得吧，安德烈斯，我说过，如果他不付你工钱，我还会找他。我肯定要找他。他就是躲进鲸鱼肚子里，我也要找到他。” “您确实这么说过，”安德烈斯说，“可是那也没什么用。” “你马上就会看到有没有用了。”唐吉诃德说。 唐吉诃德说完马上就站了起来。他让桑乔备好马。大家吃饭的时候，马也在吃草。 多罗特亚问唐吉诃德想怎么办。唐吉诃德回答说，他要去找那个无赖。不管世界上有多少个无赖，也一定要把那个无赖找出来，狠狠地惩罚他，让他把欠安德烈斯的钱全部付清。多罗特亚让唐吉诃德注意点儿，别这样做。按照他们的约定，在完成她的事之前，他不能插手其他事。这一点他应该比任何人都清楚，所以她请唐吉诃德先消消气，等从她的王国回来再说。 “可也是，”唐吉诃德说，“这样安德烈斯就只好耐心等待了，就像公主您说的，等我回来再说。我再一次发誓，为安德烈斯报仇，让他得到工钱，否则誓不罢休。” “我对这些誓言已经无所谓了，”安德烈斯说，“我现在最需要的就是弄点盘缠到塞维利亚去，而不在乎世界上有多少该报的仇。如果你们有什么吃的或带的东西，就给我一点吧。上帝与你们同在，诸位大人以及所有的游侠骑士。但愿游侠骑士们巡游时善待自己，就像他们善待我那样。” 桑乔从他的口粮里拿出一块面包和一块奶酪，递给小伙子，对他说： “拿着吧，安德烈斯兄弟，你的部分不幸已经影响了我们大家。” “哪一部分影响你了？”安德烈斯问。 “就是我给你的这块面包和奶酪，”桑乔回答说，“只有上帝才知道我是否也需要这些东西。我可以告诉你，朋友，游侠骑士的侍从常常忍饥受难，还有其他一些事情，只有亲身体验才会知道。” 安德烈斯拿着面包和奶酪，看见别人不会再给他什么东西了，就低头准备上路。临行前，他对唐吉诃德说： “看在上帝份上，游侠骑士大人，如果您再次碰到我，即使看到我被撕成碎片，也不要来帮我，还是让我自己倒霉吧。我就是再倒霉，也不会比您帮我之后倒霉得那么厉害。上帝会诅咒您，诅咒世界上的所有游侠骑士。” 唐吉诃德要站起来打安德烈斯，可是他拔腿飞跑，没人能赶上他。唐吉诃德被安德烈斯的话弄得羞愧难当。大家只好极力忍住不让自己笑出声来，免得唐吉诃德无地自容。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4599.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
