{"id":42245,"no":105,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 51","content":"Day came after the night of the governor’s round; a night which the head-carver passed without sleeping, so were his thoughts of the face and air and beauty of the disguised damsel, while the majordomo spent what was left of it in writing an account to his lord and lady of all Sancho said and did, being as much amazed at his sayings as at his doings, for there was a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity in all his words and deeds. The senor governor got up, and by Doctor Pedro Recio’s directions they made him break his fast on a little conserve and four sups of cold water, which Sancho would have readily exchanged for a piece of bread and a bunch of grapes; but seeing there was no help for it, he submitted with no little sorrow of heart and discomfort of stomach; Pedro Recio having persuaded him that light and delicate diet enlivened the wits, and that was what was most essential for persons placed in command and in responsible situations, where they have to employ not only the bodily powers but those of the mind also. By means of this sophistry Sancho was made to endure hunger, and hunger so keen that in his heart he cursed the government, and even him who had given it to him; however, with his hunger and his conserve he undertook to deliver judgments that day, and the first thing that came before him was a question that was submitted to him by a stranger, in the presence of the majordomo and the other attendants, and it was in these words: “Senor, a large river separated two districts of one and the same lordship — will your worship please to pay attention, for the case is an important and a rather knotty one? Well then, on this river there was a bridge, and at one end of it a gallows, and a sort of tribunal, where four judges commonly sat to administer the law which the lord of river, bridge and the lordship had enacted, and which was to this effect, ‘If anyone crosses by this bridge from one side to the other he shall declare on oath where he is going to and with what object; and if he swears truly, he shall be allowed to pass, but if falsely, he shall be put to death for it by hanging on the gallows erected there, without any remission.’ Though the law and its severe penalty were known, many persons crossed, but in their declarations it was easy to see at once they were telling the truth, and the judges let them pass free. It happened, however, that one man, when they came to take his declaration, swore and said that by the oath he took he was going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else. The judges held a consultation over the oath, and they said, ‘If we let this man pass free he has sworn falsely, and by the law he ought to die; but if we hang him, as he swore he was going to die on that gallows, and therefore swore the truth, by the same law he ought to go free.’ It is asked of your worship, senor governor, what are the judges to do with this man? For they are still in doubt and perplexity; and having heard of your worship’s acute and exalted intellect, they have sent me to entreat your worship on their behalf to give your opinion on this very intricate and puzzling case.” To this Sancho made answer, “Indeed those gentlemen the judges that send you to me might have spared themselves the trouble, for I have more of the obtuse than the acute in me; but repeat the case over again, so that I may understand it, and then perhaps I may be able to hit the point.” The querist repeated again and again what he had said before, and then Sancho said, “It seems to me I can set the matter right in a moment, and in this way; the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don’t hang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged.” “It is as the senor governor says,” said the messenger; “and as regards a complete comprehension of the case, there is nothing left to desire or hesitate about.” “Well then I say,” said Sancho, “that of this man they should let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with.” “But then, senor governor,” replied the querist, “the man will have to be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die; and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it.” “Look here, my good sir,” said Sancho; “either I’m a numskull or else there is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil; this I would give signed with my name if I knew how to sign; and what I have said in this case is not out of my own head, but one of the many precepts my master Don Quixote gave me the night before I left to become governor of this island, that came into my mind, and it was this, that when there was any doubt about the justice of a case I should lean to mercy; and it is God’s will that I should recollect it now, for it fits this case as if it was made for it.” “That is true,” said the majordomo; “and I maintain that Lycurgus himself, who gave laws to the Lacedemonians, could not have pronounced a better decision than the great Panza has given; let the morning’s audience close with this, and I will see that the senor governor has dinner entirely to his liking.” “That’s all I ask for — fair play,” said Sancho; “give me my dinner, and then let it rain cases and questions on me, and I’ll despatch them in a twinkling.” The majordomo kept his word, for he felt it against his conscience to kill so wise a governor by hunger; particularly as he intended to have done with him that same night, playing off the last joke he was commissioned to practise upon him. It came to pass, then, that after he had dined that day, in opposition to the rules and aphorisms of Doctor Tirteafuera, as they were taking away the cloth there came a courier with a letter from Don Quixote for the governor. Sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, and if there was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud. The secretary did so, and after he had skimmed the contents he said, “It may well be read aloud, for what Senor Don Quixote writes to your worship deserves to be printed or written in letters of gold, and it is as follows.” DON Quixote OF LA Mancha’S LETTER TO SANCHO Panza, GoVERNOR OF The ISLAND OF BARATARIA. When I was expecting to hear of thy stupidities and blunders, friend Sancho, I have received intelligence of thy displays of good sense, for which I give special thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from the dunghill and of fools to make wise men. They tell me thou dost govern as if thou wert a man, and art a man as if thou wert a beast, so great is the humility wherewith thou dost comport thyself. But I would have thee bear in mind, Sancho, that very often it is fitting and necessary for the authority of office to resist the humility of the heart; for the seemly array of one who is invested with grave duties should be such as they require and not measured by what his own humble tastes may lead him to prefer. Dress well; a stick dressed up does not look like a stick; I do not say thou shouldst wear trinkets or fine raiment, or that being a judge thou shouldst dress like a soldier, but that thou shouldst array thyself in the apparel thy office requires, and that at the same time it be neat and handsome. To win the good-will of the people thou governest there are two things, among others, that thou must do; one is to be civil to all (this, however, I told thee before), and the other to take care that food be abundant, for there is nothing that vexes the heart of the poor more than hunger and high prices. Make not many proclamations; but those thou makest take care that they be good ones, and above all that they be observed and carried out; for proclamations that are not observed are the same as if they did not exist; nay, they encourage the idea that the prince who had the wisdom and authority to make them had not the power to enforce them; and laws that threaten and are not enforced come to he like the log, the king of the frogs, that frightened them at first, but that in time they despised and mounted upon. Be a father to virtue and a stepfather to vice. Be not always strict, nor yet always lenient, but observe a mean between these two extremes, for in that is the aim of wisdom. Visit the gaols, the slaughter-houses, and the market-places; for the presence of the governor is of great importance in such places; it comforts the prisoners who are in hopes of a speedy release, it is the bugbear of the butchers who have then to give just weight, and it is the terror of the market-women for the same reason. Let it not be seen that thou art (even if perchance thou art, which I do not believe) covetous, a follower of women, or a glutton; for when the people and those that have dealings with thee become aware of thy special weakness they will bring their batteries to bear upon thee in that quarter, till they have brought thee down to the depths of perdition. Consider and reconsider, con and con over again the advices and the instructions I gave thee before thy departure hence to thy government, and thou wilt see that in them, if thou dost follow them, thou hast a help at hand that will lighten for thee the troubles and difficulties that beset governors at every step. Write to thy lord and lady and show thyself grateful to them, for ingratitude is the daughter of pride, and one of the greatest sins we know of; and he who is grateful to those who have been good to him shows that he will be so to God also who has bestowed and still bestows so many blessings upon him. My lady the duchess sent off a messenger with thy suit and another present to thy wife Teresa Panza; we expect the answer every moment. I have been a little indisposed through a certain scratching I came in for, not very much to the benefit of my nose; but it was nothing; for if there are enchanters who maltreat me, there are also some who defend me. Let me know if the majordomo who is with thee had any share in the Trifaldi performance, as thou didst suspect; and keep me informed of everything that happens thee, as the distance is so short; all the more as I am thinking of giving over very shortly this idle life I am now leading, for I was not born for it. A thing has occurred to me which I am inclined to think will put me out of favour with the duke and duchess; but though I am sorry for it I do not care, for after all I must obey my calling rather than their pleasure, in accordance with the common saying, amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas. I quote this Latin to thee because I conclude that since thou hast been a governor thou wilt have learned it. Adieu; God keep thee from being an object of pity to anyone. Thy friend, DON Quixote OF LA Mancha. Sancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was praised and considered wise by all who heard it; he then rose up from table, and calling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own room, and without putting it off any longer set about answering his master Don Quixote at once; and he bade the secretary write down what he told him without adding or suppressing anything, which he did, and the answer was to the following effect. SANCHO Panza’S LETTER TO DON Quixote OF LA Mancha. The pressure of business is so great upon me that I have no time to scratch my head or even to cut my nails; and I have them so long — God send a remedy for it. I say this, master of my soul, that you may not be surprised if I have not until now sent you word of how I fare, well or ill, in this government, in which I am suffering more hunger than when we two were wandering through the woods and wastes. My lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain spies had got into this island to kill me; but up to the present I have not found out any except a certain doctor who receives a salary in this town for killing all the governors that come here; he is called Doctor Pedro Recio, and is from Tirteafuera; so you see what a name he has to make me dread dying under his hands. This doctor says of himself that he does not cure diseases when there are any, but prevents them coming, and the medicines he uses are diet and more diet until he brings one down to bare bones; as if leanness was not worse than fever. In short he is killing me with hunger, and I am dying myself of vexation; for when I thought I was coming to this government to get my meat hot and my drink cool, and take my ease between holland sheets on feather beds, I find I have come to do penance as if I was a hermit; and as I don’t do it willingly I suspect that in the end the devil will carry me off. So far I have not handled any dues or taken any bribes, and I don’t know what to think of it; for here they tell me that the governors that come to this island, before entering it have plenty of money either given to them or lent to them by the people of the town, and that this is the usual custom not only here but with all who enter upon governments. Last night going the rounds I came upon a fair damsel in man’s clothes, and a brother of hers dressed as a woman; my head-carver has fallen in love with the girl, and has in his own mind chosen her for a wife, so he says, and I have chosen youth for a son-in-law; to-day we are going to explain our intentions to the father of the pair, who is one Diego de la Llana, a gentleman and an old Christian as much as you please. I have visited the market-places, as your worship advises me, and yesterday I found a stall-keeper selling new hazel nuts and proved her to have mixed a bushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel of new; I confiscated the whole for the children of the charity-school, who will know how to distinguish them well enough, and I sentenced her not to come into the market-place for a fortnight; they told me I did bravely. I can tell your worship it is commonly said in this town that there are no people worse than the market-women, for they are all barefaced, unconscionable, and impudent, and I can well believe it from what I have seen of them in other towns. I am very glad my lady the duchess has written to my wife Teresa Panza and sent her the present your worship speaks of; and I will strive to show myself grateful when the time comes; kiss her hands for me, and tell her I say she has not thrown it into a sack with a hole in it, as she will see in the end. I should not like your worship to have any difference with my lord and lady; for if you fall out with them it is plain it must do me harm; and as you give me advice to be grateful it will not do for your worship not to be so yourself to those who have shown you such kindness, and by whom you have been treated so hospitably in their castle. That about the scratching I don’t understand; but I suppose it must be one of the ill-turns the wicked enchanters are always doing your worship; when we meet I shall know all about it. I wish I could send your worship something; but I don’t know what to send, unless it be some very curious clyster pipes, to work with bladders, that they make in this island; but if the office remains with me I’ll find out something to send, one way or another. If my wife Teresa Panza writes to me, pay the postage and send me the letter, for I have a very great desire to hear how my house and wife and children are going on. And so, may God deliver your worship from evil-minded enchanters, and bring me well and peacefully out of this government, which I doubt, for I expect to take leave of it and my life together, from the way Doctor Pedro Recio treats me. Your worship’s servant SANCHO Panza The GoVERNOR. The secretary sealed the letter, and immediately dismissed the courier; and those who were carrying on the joke against Sancho putting their heads together arranged how he was to be dismissed from the government. Sancho spent the afternoon in drawing up certain ordinances relating to the good government of what he fancied the island; and he ordained that there were to be no provision hucksters in the State, and that men might import wine into it from any place they pleased, provided they declared the quarter it came from, so that a price might be put upon it according to its quality, reputation, and the estimation it was held in; and he that watered his wine, or changed the name, was to forfeit his life for it. He reduced the prices of all manner of shoes, boots, and stockings, but of shoes in particular, as they seemed to him to run extravagantly high. He established a fixed rate for servants’ wages, which were becoming recklessly exorbitant. He laid extremely heavy penalties upon those who sang lewd or loose songs either by day or night. He decreed that no blind man should sing of any miracle in verse, unless he could produce authentic evidence that it was true, for it was his opinion that most of those the blind men sing are trumped up, to the detriment of the true ones. He established and created an alguacil of the poor, not to harass them, but to examine them and see whether they really were so; for many a sturdy thief or drunkard goes about under cover of a make-believe crippled limb or a sham sore. In a word, he made so many good rules that to this day they are preserved there, and are called The constitutions of the great governor Sancho Panza. 在总督巡视的那天晚上，餐厅侍者夜不能寐，一直在想那个女扮男装的姑娘的如玉风姿和如花容貌。管家则利用第二天天还没亮的时间，把桑乔的言行记录下来，准备报告给他的主子。桑乔的言行使他感到惊奇，他觉得桑乔的言行总是前后不一致，愚中有智，智中有愚。 总督大人也起床了。按照佩德罗·雷西奥的吩咐，桑乔只吃了一口腌蔬菜，喝了几口凉水，其实桑乔很想吃一块面包和一串葡萄。不过他知道他必须这样做，由不得自己，也就将就了，可是心疼得厉害，胃也不好受。佩德罗·雷西奥已经告诉他，吃得少而精可以活跃人的智慧，而掌大权当大官的人用得更多的是脑力而不是体力。 既然这样，桑乔就只好挨饿了。他在心里暗暗诅咒这个总督职位，甚至还诅咒让他当总督的那个人。尽管只吃了点腌蔬菜，仍然饥肠辘辘，桑乔那天还是去升堂判案了。第一个上来的是个外地人。他当着管家和其他人的面问桑乔： “大人，有一条大河把一位领主的领地一分为二。请您注意听好，这个情况很重要，而且有点复杂。这条河上有一座桥，桥的一头有一个绞刑架和一幢当审判厅用的房子，平时总有四个法官在那儿执行这条河、这座桥和这片领地的主人的命令。这个命令是这样的：如果有人要经过这座桥到河的对岸去，他首先得发誓声明他过桥后要到哪儿去，要去干什么。如果他说的是真的，就让他过桥；如果他说的是谎话，就在旁边的那个绞刑架上绞死他，绝不宽恕。 “这个命令和这个苛刻的条件生效后，有很多人过了桥。法官只要看他们发誓时说的是真话，就让他们过桥。后来有一天，一个人发誓说他要做的就是死在旁边那个绞刑架上，没有其他事。几位法官考虑了一下这个人的誓言，议论道：‘如果咱们让这个人过去，那么他发誓时就是说了谎，按照命令就得绞死他；可如果咱们绞死他，他又发誓说他要死在那个绞刑架上，那么他的誓言又是真的了，按照命令，就应该放他过河。’那么请问您，总督大人，几位法官应该怎样处置这个人呢？他们到现在还没有拿定主意。他们仰慕您的聪慧大名，派我来请您谈谈您对这个如此棘手的案子的看法。” 桑乔答道： “其实这几位法官大可不必派你来，因为我也并不聪明。不过既然这样了，你就再讲讲这件事，让我听个明白，说不定我还能抓住问题的关键呢。” 来人又把刚才说过的事说了两遍。桑乔说道： “我觉得这件事我两句话就可以说清楚。事情是这样的：有个人发誓要死在绞刑架上。如果他真的死在绞刑架上，那么他发的誓就是真话，按照命令，就该让他过桥；可是如果不绞死他呢，他发誓时就撒了谎，按照同一命令，就该绞死他。” “事情正像总督大人说的这样，”来人说道，“明明白白，清清楚楚。” “那么，我说呀，”桑乔说，“这个人说真话那部分应该过桥，把他说假话那部分绞死，这就不折不扣地执行了有关过桥的命令嘛。” “总督大人，”来人说道，“那就得把人分为两半，一半撒谎的，一半真实的。可如果真分了，那人准得死，也就根本无法执行什么命令了，可是那个命令又必须执行。” “你听我说，好人，”桑乔说，“或者是我这个人笨，或者是提到的这个人既有理由去死，也有理由活着过桥。如果他说了真话，他可以免于一死；可他若是说了假话，就该处死他。既然这样，我觉得你应该告诉派你来的那些人，既然处死他和赦免他并放他过桥的理由是一样的，那么行善总是比作恶容易受到赞扬。如果我会签字的话，我就会签上我的名字，把这件事定下来。这种处理方法并不是我说的，我想起了我到这个岛屿就任总督之前我的主人唐吉诃德，他给我的诸多告诫之一就是在执法可宽可严的情况下以宽为好。上帝提醒我这句话，现在正好用上。” “有道理，”管家说，“我觉得，就是为斯巴达人立法的利库尔戈也不会做出比我们伟大的桑乔更为英明的判决了。今天上午的审判到此结束，我去吩咐他们给总督大人做点可口的饭菜。” “我正需要呢，你可别骗我。”桑乔说，“让我吃饱了，别管什么疑难案子都尽管来，由我来指点迷津！” 于是管家吩咐人做饭。他觉得让如此英明的总督饿死实在于心不忍，而且他还想在当晚结束他奉命同唐吉诃德开的最后一个玩笑呢。那天桑乔不顾蒂尔特亚富埃拉那位医生的劝诫大吃了一顿。刚吃完饭，一个信使就送来了唐吉诃德给总督的一封信。桑乔让文书把信念给他听听，而且如果没有什么机密内容的话，就大声念。文书打开信看了一遍，说道： “完全可以大声念。唐吉诃德大人给您的这封信真可谓字字珠玑。信是这样写的： 曼查的唐吉诃德给巴拉塔里亚岛总督桑乔·潘萨的信 桑乔朋友，我本以为别人会说你办事粗心愚蠢，可没想到别人却说你处事灵敏。我为此特别感谢老天，是‘他从粪堆中提拔穷乏人’①，使笨蛋变得聪明。据说你当总督时还像个人似的，可你当普通人的时候，就凭你那寒酸劲儿，却像个牲口似的。桑乔，你应该告诫自己，时时注意，而且也有必要注意，当官就得有个当官的样子，身居要职的人外观必须与他的身份相符，而不能由着自己的寒酸性子来。你应该穿得好一点儿，一经包装，大不一样。我并不是让你穿金戴银，不过作为长官，也不要穿得跟士兵似的，而是应该根据你的职位穿戴，只要干净整洁就行。 ①此处援引了《圣经》中的话。 要想赢得你所管辖的百姓的拥护，你就得做两件事情：第一就是要与人为善，其实这点我已对你说过多次；另一点就是保证要丰衣足食，对于老百姓来说，没有什么比饥饿和贫困更令他们忧虑的了。 你不要颁布很多法令，而如果要颁布，就一定要颁布好的法令，尤其要注意的是，这些法令必须得到遵守执行。有令不行等于没有，而且还会让人以为他们的君主有能力和权力制定法令，却没有力量使法令得到贯彻执行。咋咋唬唬而又不执行的法令早晚身像充当蛤蟆王的木头一样，蛤蟆开始还怕那根木头，后来便看不起它，最后干脆跳到它上面去了。 你要厚道德薄恶习。你不要总是那么严厉，也不要总是那么和善，而要寻求两个极端之间的中庸之道，这才是最聪明的。你应该到监狱、屠宰场和广场去，总督在这些地方出现是很重要的。囚徒总希望他们的案子早点结束，你去就可以安慰他们；对于屠夫们，你是一种威慑，他们就不敢缺斤短两；对于摊贩们你同样是一种威慑。你即使有点儿贪婪、好色和贪吃，也不要表现出来，我相信你不是这种人。在你上任之前我给你写的那些劝诫，你如果还保留着的话，要反复重温，你就会知道，它们可以帮助你克服那些当总督的人时时遇到的困难和麻烦。你要给你的主人写信，表示你是知恩图报的人。忘恩负义由高傲产生，是人类已知的几大罪孽之一。对恩人知恩图报的人自然也知道感激上帝，因为上帝曾经而且不断地赐予他恩德。 公爵夫人已经派人把你的衣服和另一件礼物给你妻子特雷莎·潘萨送去了，目前还没有回音。我现在有些不舒服，鼻子被猫抓了几下，但并不严重。这没什么，如果说有专门同我过不去的魔法师，那么也会有专门保护我的魔法师。 你告诉我，同你在一起的管家是不是像你怀疑的那样，同三摆裙夫人的事情有牵连？还有，你在那儿遇到的事情都请一一告诉我，咱们离得不远。此外，我还想尽快摆脱这种无所事事的生活，我生来就不是过这种日子的人。 我现在遇到了一件事，估计公爵和公爵夫人不会高兴。我虽然很为难，却又顾不得了。我首先得履行我的职责，而不是依照我个人的好恶来决定，就像人们常说的：“柏拉图亲，真理更亲。”我说这句拉丁文也是为了让你知道，你当总督以后也得学拉丁文。向上帝致意，让上帝保佑你别成了可怜虫。 你的朋友 曼查的唐吉诃德 桑乔认真地听完了这封信。其他听到信的人也齐声称赞这封信写得有水平。桑乔从桌旁站起来，叫文书到他的房间去。他刻不容缓地要给他的主人唐吉诃德写回信。桑乔告诉文书，他说什么，文书就写什么，不必有任何删改。文书答应照办。他的回信如下： 桑乔·潘萨给曼查的唐吉诃德的信 我现在太忙了，忙得连挠头剪指甲的时间都没有，所以我现在的指甲长得很，只好听天由命吧。我最亲爱的大人，我到现在一直没有把我当总督的情况告诉您是怕您担忧，我现在正挨饿，比咱们在荒郊野岭时饿得还厉害。 公爵大人有一天给我写来一封信，告诉我已经有几个奸细潜进这个岛屿想害死我。不过到目前为止，我只发现了这儿的一个大夫，他受雇把来这儿的总督全都害死了。他就是佩德罗·雷西奥大夫，是蒂尔特亚富埃拉人，您听听这名字，我怎么能不担心死在他手里呢！这个大夫说，他并不是有病医病，而是无病预防，而他采用的方法就是节食再节食，直到把人饿成皮包骨，就好像瘦弱并不比发烧更糟糕似的。最后，他会把我逐渐饿死。我也快气死了。我本来想到这个岛上来吃香的喝辣的，铺软的盖绒的，可是到头来却像个苦行僧似的。我并不是自愿节食的，所以早晚得见阎王。 至今我还没有获取应得之利，也没有得到不义之财。我无法想象这些都从哪儿来。我听说，岛上的总督往往在上岛之前就有人送给他或借给他很多钱。据说不仅是这儿，其他地方的总督也都是这样。 昨天晚上我出去巡视，碰到了一个女扮男装的姑娘和她的男扮女装的弟弟。我的餐厅侍者爱上了那个姑娘，据他说，他甚至想入非非地要娶她为妻。我倒是看上了那个男孩子，想让他做我女婿。今天，我们两人要去找那两个孩子的父亲，把我们的想法提出来。那人叫迭戈·德拉利亚纳，是一位很老的基督徒绅士。 我已经照您的劝告去过广场了。昨天我在那儿检查了一个卖榛子的女贩子，发现她把一法内加的新榛子同另一法内加又陈又空又烂的榛子混在一起卖。我把她的榛子全没收了，送给孤儿院的孩子们，他们能区分出新老榛子来；我又罚那个女贩子十五天内不准进入广场。别人都说我做得很棒。我告诉您，这个地方的女贩子最坏，是出了名的，她们都恬不知耻，丧尽良心，而且胆大妄为。我相信是这样的，我在其他地方看到的女贩子也是这样的。 您说公爵夫人给我老婆特雷莎·潘萨写了一封信，还送了她一件礼物，我对此非常满足。我会找机会报答的。请您代我吻她的手，告诉她，她的好心不会白费，以后就看我的行动吧。 我不希望您同公爵和公爵夫人闹别扭。如果您同他们斗气，也会影响到我。您劝我知恩图报，公爵和公爵夫人如此照顾您，而且在他们的城堡里热情款待您，如果您不知恩图报就不对了。 至于猫抓的事我还不清楚。不过我可以想象得到，一定是那些常常同您过不去的恶毒魔法师捣的鬼，此事咱们见面再谈。 我想送您一点儿东西，可又不知道该送什么，要不就送您这个岛上出产的几根洗肠子用的灌肠管吧，样子很别致。假如我还继续担任总督，我无论如何也会给您送点儿东西去。 如果我老婆特雷莎·潘萨给我寄信来，请您先代付邮费，再把信转给我。我很想知道我家、我老婆和孩子们的情况。最后，愿上帝保佑您摆脱那些魔法师的恶意纠缠，让我这个总督当得平平安安。我对此还有点怀疑，因为若是照佩德罗·雷西奥大夫那样对待我，我恐怕连总督的位置带性命都保不住。 您的仆人 桑乔·潘萨总督 文书把信封好，然后派人送走。几个拿桑乔开心的人又聚集在一起，商量怎样把这位总督打发走。那天下午，桑乔准备了几个法令，要治理他心目中的岛屿。他命令不准在岛上贩卖食品，不过允许从任何地方向岛上进口酒，但必须标明是何地的产品，以便按照它的质地和名气制定价格；如果有人胆敢搀水或者改变酒的名称，格杀勿论。他还把鞋袜的价格都降了一些，特别是鞋的价格，他觉得鞋的价格太高了。他规定了佣人的工钱标准，因为有的佣人利欲熏心，漫天要价。他规定对于唱淫秽歌曲的人，无论是白天唱还是晚上唱，都一律严惩。他命令不准瞎子唱奇迹剧①中的民谣，除非他有确凿的证据表明那些都是事实，因为他觉得瞎子唱的东西都是假的，有损于真实性。他还创设了一个专管残疾人的官儿，不过不是为了迫害残疾人，而是让他去检查那些人是否真正是残疾人，因为有的人假装腿脚有毛病或者身上有烂疮，其实是盗贼或酗酒的健康人。总之，桑乔颁布了一些很好的法令，至今还在那里沿用，而且被称为《伟大总督桑乔·潘萨大法》。
