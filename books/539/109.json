{"id":42249,"no":109,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 55","content":"The length of time he delayed with Ricote prevented Sancho from reaching the duke’s castle that day, though he was within half a league of it when night, somewhat dark and cloudy, overtook him. This, however, as it was summer time, did not give him much uneasiness, and he turned aside out of the road intending to wait for morning; but his ill luck and hard fate so willed it that as he was searching about for a place to make himself as comfortable as possible, he and Dapple fell into a deep dark hole that lay among some very old buildings. As he fell he commended himself with all his heart to God, fancying he was not going to stop until he reached the depths of the bottomless pit; but it did not turn out so, for at little more than thrice a man’s height Dapple touched bottom, and he found himself sitting on him without having received any hurt or damage whatever. He felt himself all over and held his breath to try whether he was quite sound or had a hole made in him anywhere, and finding himself all right and whole and in perfect health he was profuse in his thanks to God our Lord for the mercy that had been shown him, for he made sure he had been broken into a thousand pieces. He also felt along the sides of the pit with his hands to see if it were possible to get out of it without help, but he found they were quite smooth and afforded no hold anywhere, at which he was greatly distressed, especially when he heard how pathetically and dolefully Dapple was bemoaning himself, and no wonder he complained, nor was it from ill-temper, for in truth he was not in a very good case. “Alas,” said Sancho, “what unexpected accidents happen at every step to those who live in this miserable world! Who would have said that one who saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne, governor of an island, giving orders to his servants and his vassals, would see himself to-day buried in a pit without a soul to help him, or servant or vassal to come to his relief? Here must we perish with hunger, my ass and myself, if indeed we don’t die first, he of his bruises and injuries, and I of grief and sorrow. At any rate I’ll not be as lucky as my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, when he went down into the cave of that enchanted Montesinos, where he found people to make more of him than if he had been in his own house; for it seems he came in for a table laid out and a bed ready made. There he saw fair and pleasant visions, but here I’ll see, I imagine, toads and adders. Unlucky wretch that I am, what an end my follies and fancies have come to! They’ll take up my bones out of this, when it is heaven’s will that I’m found, picked clean, white and polished, and my good Dapple’s with them, and by that, perhaps, it will be found out who we are, at least by such as have heard that Sancho Panza never separated from his ass, nor his ass from Sancho Panza. Unlucky wretches, I say again, that our hard fate should not let us die in our own country and among our own people, where if there was no help for our misfortune, at any rate there would be some one to grieve for it and to close our eyes as we passed away! O comrade and friend, how ill have I repaid thy faithful services! Forgive me, and entreat Fortune, as well as thou canst, to deliver us out of this miserable strait we are both in; and I promise to put a crown of laurel on thy head, and make thee look like a poet laureate, and give thee double feeds.”\n \n In this strain did Sancho bewail himself, and his ass listened to him, but answered him never a word, such was the distress and anguish the poor beast found himself in. At length, after a night spent in bitter moanings and lamentations, day came, and by its light Sancho perceived that it was wholly impossible to escape out of that pit without help, and he fell to bemoaning his fate and uttering loud shouts to find out if there was anyone within hearing; but all his shouting was only crying in the wilderness, for there was not a soul anywhere in the neighbourhood to hear him, and then at last he gave himself up for dead. Dapple was lying on his back, and Sancho helped him to his feet, which he was scarcely able to keep; and then taking a piece of bread out of his alforjas which had shared their fortunes in the fall, he gave it to the ass, to whom it was not unwelcome, saying to him as if he understood him, “With bread all sorrows are less.”\n And now he perceived on one side of the pit a hole large enough to admit a person if he stooped and squeezed himself into a small compass. Sancho made for it, and entered it by creeping, and found it wide and spacious on the inside, which he was able to see as a ray of sunlight that penetrated what might be called the roof showed it all plainly. He observed too that it opened and widened out into another spacious cavity; seeing which he made his way back to where the ass was, and with a stone began to pick away the clay from the hole until in a short time he had made room for the beast to pass easily, and this accomplished, taking him by the halter, he proceeded to traverse the cavern to see if there was any outlet at the other end. He advanced, sometimes in the dark, sometimes without light, but never without fear; “God Almighty help me!” said he to himself; “this that is a misadventure to me would make a good adventure for my master Don Quixote. He would have been sure to take these depths and dungeons for flowery gardens or the palaces of Galiana, and would have counted upon issuing out of this darkness and imprisonment into some blooming meadow; but I, unlucky that I am, hopeless and spiritless, expect at every step another pit deeper than the first to open under my feet and swallow me up for good; ‘welcome evil, if thou comest alone.’”\n In this way and with these reflections he seemed to himself to have travelled rather more than half a league, when at last he perceived a dim light that looked like daylight and found its way in on one side, showing that this road, which appeared to him the road to the other world, led to some opening.\n Here Cide Hamete leaves him, and returns to Don Quixote, who in high spirits and satisfaction was looking forward to the day fixed for the battle he was to fight with him who had robbed Dona Rodriguez’s daughter of her honour, for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction for the wrong and injury shamefully done to her. It came to pass, then, that having sallied forth one morning to practise and exercise himself in what he would have to do in the encounter he expected to find himself engaged in the next day, as he was putting Rocinante through his paces or pressing him to the charge, he brought his feet so close to a pit that but for reining him in tightly it would have been impossible for him to avoid falling into it. He pulled him up, however, without a fall, and coming a little closer examined the hole without dismounting; but as he was looking at it he heard loud cries proceeding from it, and by listening attentively was able to make out that he who uttered them was saying, “Ho, above there! is there any Christian that hears me, or any charitable gentleman that will take pity on a sinner buried alive, on an unfortunate disgoverned governor?”\n It struck Don Quixote that it was the voice of Sancho Panza he heard, whereat he was taken aback and amazed, and raising his own voice as much as he could, he cried out, “Who is below there? Who is that complaining?”\n “Who should be here, or who should complain,” was the answer, “but the forlorn Sancho Panza, for his sins and for his ill-luck governor of the island of Barataria, squire that was to the famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha?”\n When Don Quixote heard this his amazement was redoubled and his perturbation grew greater than ever, for it suggested itself to his mind that Sancho must be dead, and that his soul was in torment down there; and carried away by this idea he exclaimed, “I conjure thee by everything that as a Catholic Christian I can conjure thee by, tell me who thou art; and if thou art a soul in torment, tell me what thou wouldst have me do for thee; for as my profession is to give aid and succour to those that need it in this world, it will also extend to aiding and succouring the distressed of the other, who cannot help themselves.”\n “In that case,” answered the voice, “your worship who speaks to me must be my master Don Quixote of La Mancha; nay, from the tone of the voice it is plain it can be nobody else.”\n “Don Quixote I am,” replied Don Quixote, “he whose profession it is to aid and succour the living and the dead in their necessities; wherefore tell me who thou art, for thou art keeping me in suspense; because, if thou art my squire Sancho Panza, and art dead, since the devils have not carried thee off, and thou art by God’s mercy in purgatory, our holy mother the Roman Catholic Church has intercessory means sufficient to release thee from the pains thou art in; and I for my part will plead with her to that end, so far as my substance will go; without further delay, therefore, declare thyself, and tell me who thou art.”\n “By all that’s good,” was the answer, “and by the birth of whomsoever your worship chooses, I swear, Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, that I am your squire Sancho Panza, and that I have never died all my life; but that, having given up my government for reasons that would require more time to explain, I fell last night into this pit where I am now, and Dapple is witness and won’t let me lie, for more by token he is here with me.”\n Nor was this all; one would have fancied the ass understood what Sancho said, because that moment he began to bray so loudly that the whole cave rang again.\n “Famous testimony!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “I know that bray as well as if I was its mother, and thy voice too, my Sancho. Wait while I go to the duke’s castle, which is close by, and I will bring some one to take thee out of this pit into which thy sins no doubt have brought thee.”\n “Go, your worship,” said Sancho, “and come back quick for God’s sake; for I cannot bear being buried alive any longer, and I’m dying of fear.”\n Don Quixote left him, and hastened to the castle to tell the duke and duchess what had happened Sancho, and they were not a little astonished at it; they could easily understand his having fallen, from the confirmatory circumstance of the cave which had been in existence there from time immemorial; but they could not imagine how he had quitted the government without their receiving any intimation of his coming. To be brief, they fetched ropes and tackle, as the saying is, and by dint of many hands and much labour they drew up Dapple and Sancho Panza out of the darkness into the light of day. A student who saw him remarked, “That’s the way all bad governors should come out of their governments, as this sinner comes out of the depths of the pit, dead with hunger, pale, and I suppose without a farthing.”\n Sancho overheard him and said, “It is eight or ten days, brother growler, since I entered upon the government of the island they gave me, and all that time I never had a bellyful of victuals, no not for an hour; doctors persecuted me and enemies crushed my bones; nor had I any opportunity of taking bribes or levying taxes; and if that be the case, as it is, I don’t deserve, I think, to come out in this fashion; but ‘man proposes and God disposes;’ and God knows what is best, and what suits each one best; and ‘as the occasion, so the behaviour;’ and ‘let nobody say “I won’t drink of this water;\"’ and ‘where one thinks there are flitches, there are no pegs;’ God knows my meaning and that’s enough; I say no more, though I could.”\n “Be not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “or there will never be an end of it; keep a safe conscience and let them say what they like; for trying to stop slanderers’ tongues is like trying to put gates to the open plain. If a governor comes out of his government rich, they say he has been a thief; and if he comes out poor, that he has been a noodle and a blockhead.”\n “They’ll be pretty sure this time,” said Sancho, “to set me down for a fool rather than a thief.”\n Thus talking, and surrounded by boys and a crowd of people, they reached the castle, where in one of the corridors the duke and duchess stood waiting for them; but Sancho would not go up to see the duke until he had first put up Dapple in the stable, for he said he had passed a very bad night in his last quarters; then he went upstairs to see his lord and lady, and kneeling before them he said, “Because it was your highnesses’ pleasure, not because of any desert of my own, I went to govern your island of Barataria, which ‘I entered naked, and naked I find myself; I neither lose nor gain.’ Whether I have governed well or ill, I have had witnesses who will say what they think fit. I have answered questions, I have decided causes, and always dying of hunger, for Doctor Pedro Recio of Tirteafuera, the island and governor doctor, would have it so. Enemies attacked us by night and put us in a great quandary, but the people of the island say they came off safe and victorious by the might of my arm; and may God give them as much health as there’s truth in what they say. In short, during that time I have weighed the cares and responsibilities governing brings with it, and by my reckoning I find my shoulders can’t bear them, nor are they a load for my loins or arrows for my quiver; and so, before the government threw me over I preferred to throw the government over; and yesterday morning I left the island as I found it, with the same streets, houses, and roofs it had when I entered it. I asked no loan of anybody, nor did I try to fill my pocket; and though I meant to make some useful laws, I made hardly any, as I was afraid they would not be kept; for in that case it comes to the same thing to make them or not to make them. I quitted the island, as I said, without any escort except my ass; I fell into a pit, I pushed on through it, until this morning by the light of the sun I saw an outlet, but not so easy a one but that, had not heaven sent me my master Don Quixote, I’d have stayed there till the end of the world. So now my lord and lady duke and duchess, here is your governor Sancho Panza, who in the bare ten days he has held the government has come by the knowledge that he would not give anything to be governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world; and that point being settled, kissing your worships’ feet, and imitating the game of the boys when they say, ‘leap thou, and give me one,’ I take a leap out of the government and pass into the service of my master Don Quixote; for after all, though in it I eat my bread in fear and trembling, at any rate I take my fill; and for my part, so long as I’m full, it’s all alike to me whether it’s with carrots or with partridges.”\n Here Sancho brought his long speech to an end, Don Quixote having been the whole time in dread of his uttering a host of absurdities; and when he found him leave off with so few, he thanked heaven in his heart. The duke embraced Sancho and told him he was heartily sorry he had given up the government so soon, but that he would see that he was provided with some other post on his estate less onerous and more profitable. The duchess also embraced him, and gave orders that he should be taken good care of, as it was plain to see he had been badly treated and worse bruised.\n \n 桑乔那天半路遇见里科特耽误了时间，当天没能赶回公爵的城堡。他离城堡还有半西里路的时候，天色就黑下来了。不过因为是夏天，问题也不大。桑乔离开了大路，想找个地方，等到天亮再走。可他偏偏是那么倒霉，就在他找地方休息的时候，竟然连人带驴掉进了几座破旧建筑物之间一个又深又黑的坑里。往坑下摔的时候，桑乔在内心虔诚地祈求上帝保佑。他以为自己摔到万丈深渊里去了，可事实并不是这样。他的驴摔到三人深的时候就落了地，桑乔在驴背上竟然安然无恙。他摸遍了自己的全身，又屏住气，看自己到底是完整无缺还是身上哪儿摔出了窟窿。他见自己好好的，没有摔坏，便不停地感谢上帝对他大发慈悲，否则他肯定会摔得粉身碎骨了。他用手摸着坑壁，想看自己能否爬出去，可到处都是光秃秃的，没有可以下手的地方，因此他很沮丧，再听到他的驴的痛苦呻吟声，就更难过了。不过这不怪驴，它并不是无病呻吟，而是确实不好受。\n “哎，”桑乔感慨道，“人活在这个可怜的世界上，随时都有可能遇到飞来的横祸！谁能想到，岛屿的总督昨天还对佣人和臣民颐指气使，今天竟摔到了一个坑里，而且无论是他的佣人还是他的臣民，居然无一人赶来相助！即使驴不疼死，我不伤心死，我们也得在这儿活活饿死！至少我不像我的主人唐吉诃德那样走运。他下了蒙特西诺斯洞窟后，那儿的饭桌和床铺都是现成的，条件比他家里还好。他在那儿看到的幽灵都漂亮文静，而我在这儿看到的只能是蛤蟆和蛇。我真倒霉，我的疯癫和幻想落了个什么结局呀！等到老天有眼发现我们的时候，我们已经成为两具白骨了。他们发现我这头好驴的骨头，大概就会猜到我们是准了，至少那些听说过桑乔离不开驴，驴也离不开桑乔的人可以猜到。我再说一遍，我们真可怜，我们的倒霉的命运竟不让我们死在家乡，死在亲人中间，否则，即使无法把我们从不幸中解救出来，至少还有人为我们伤心，在我们临终时为我们合上眼睛！哎，我的伙伴，我的朋友，你忠心耿耿地为我服务，可是我对你的报答多么不够呀！原谅我吧，请求命运尽可能把我们从困境中解脱出来吧。我发誓要在你的头上戴个桂冠，让你像个得了桂冠的诗人一样，而且还要把你的饲料增加一倍。”\n 桑乔在那儿唉声叹气，他的驴在旁边听着一声不吭，这就是可怜的桑乔当时的处境。桑乔在哀叹和抱怨中度过了那个凄凉的夜晚。白昼来临，天亮了，这回桑乔才看清，如果没人帮忙，他就休想从坑里出去。他哀叹起来，喊叫起来，看是否有人听见自己的喊声。可是他的喊声如落入荒野，没人能听到他的喊声，于是桑乔以为自己死定了。驴仰面躺在地上，桑乔把它扶了起来，它才算勉强站住了。褡裢也同桑乔一起落入了坑内。桑乔从褡裢里拿出一块面包喂驴，驴也不客气。就好像驴能听懂他说话似的，桑乔对驴说道：\n “肚子吃饱，痛苦减少。”\n 这时，桑乔发现坑的一侧有一个洞，容得下一个人蜷缩进去。桑乔爬了进去，看到那洞里面非常宽敞，一束阳光从一个可以称为洞顶的地方射进来，照亮了洞里。他还看到，这个洞延伸到另一边，另外还有一个宽敞的洞穴。看完后，桑乔又回到驴身边，拿起一块石头，把洞口周围的土挖掉，一直挖到能够让驴顺利通过的程度才罢手。桑乔扯起驴缰绳走过洞口，向前走去，看是否能从另一侧找到出口。洞内忽明忽暗，令人提心吊胆。“万能的上帝保佑我吧。”桑乔心里说，“这种事对于我来说是倒霉事，但若是遇到我的主人唐吉诃德，就成奇遇了。他肯定会把这地穴洞窟当成是鲜花满园和富丽堂皇的宫殿。而且，他还希望走出又黑又窄的洞后，外面又是遍野的鲜花。我就没那么有运气了。我没这个意识，也没这个情绪。我每走一步都想着脚下会裂出一个更比一个大的深渊，把我吞进去。‘祸如果单行，就算是万幸’。”桑乔就这样想着，走了大约半西里路，发现前面有一束朦胧的光线。\n 对于桑乔来说，也许这就意味着他的生死路走到了尽头。\n 锡德·哈迈德·贝嫩赫利写到这儿，又把故事转到了唐吉诃德那儿。唐吉诃德正惊喜地等着与夺走了唐娜罗德里格斯女儿名誉的家伙决斗，他要让那个家伙为自己做的孽付出代价。在预定决斗的前一天早晨，唐吉诃德骑着罗西南多疾驰出去，准备为决斗做些演练活动，结果跑到一个坑边的时候，幸亏他紧紧勒住了缰绳，不然就掉下去了。唐吉诃德催马走到坑边，从马上向坑内张望。他正看着，忽听坑内有人大声喊叫。他又仔细听了听，听到仿佛有人在向他呼救：\n “喂，上面的人，有哪位基督徒能听见我喊叫吗？或者，有哪位好心的骑士心疼这位被活埋的罪人，这位已经不再是总督的不幸总督吗？”\n 唐吉诃德听着觉得像桑乔的声音，非常惊奇。他全力提高了嗓门，问道：\n “谁在下面？谁在叫苦？”\n “还有谁能在这儿叫苦呢？”桑乔说，“只能是那个由于自己的罪孽和厄运而吃尽了苦头的巴拉塔里亚岛总督，也就是曼查的著名骑士唐吉诃德以前的侍从桑乔·潘萨呗。”\n 唐吉诃德听下面这么一说，更惊奇了，而且开始感到害怕。他立刻想到桑乔大概已经死了，眼下在下面赎罪的是桑乔的鬼魂。这样一想，他便说道：\n “我以一个虔诚的基督徒的名义向你发誓，请你告诉我你是谁。如果你是个正在涤罪的鬼魂，请告诉我，我能为你做点什么。我的职业就是帮助这个世界受苦受难的人，而且我也扶助另一个世界的苦难者，假如他们不能自助的话。”\n “这么说来，”桑乔说，“上面同我说话的人大概就是我的主人唐吉诃德吧，听声音只能是他，不可能是别人。”\n “我是唐吉诃德。”唐吉诃德答道，“我从事的事业就是帮助受苦难的活人和死人。告诉我你是谁，我简直莫名其妙了。如果你是我的侍从桑乔，那么你大概已经死了。可是上帝开恩，没让魔鬼把你带走，而是让你留在炼狱里。我们神圣的天主教完全可以帮助你，把你从这个炼狱里解脱出来。我也愿意用我的全部财力求教会超度你。所以我刚才问你，你到底是谁。”\n “真见鬼了，”下面答道，“不管您怎么说，唐吉诃德大人，我发誓，我就是您的侍从桑乔。我一天也没死过，只不过是不再当总督了。这里面的情况和原因待我以后再找时间告诉您。昨天晚上，我掉到了这个坑里。我的驴也在这儿，它可以作证，它就在我身边呢。”\n 驴似乎听懂了桑乔说的话，立刻大声嘶叫起来，叫声在整个坑里回荡。\n “真是个好见证！”唐吉诃德说，“这驴叫声我太熟悉了，你的声音我也听到了。桑乔，你等着，公爵的城堡离这儿不远，我马上就去，找人把你从坑里弄出来。你掉进坑里，大概是因为你造了孽。”\n “您去吧，”桑乔说，“看在上帝份上，您快点儿回来。我被活埋在这儿，真受不了，简直快要把我吓死了。”\n 唐吉诃德离开桑乔回到城堡里，把桑乔的事告诉了公爵和公爵夫人。他们虽然知道那个坑，那个坑早在不知什么年代就有了，可还是感到很意外。他们不明白桑乔为什么不事先通知他们就决定不当总督了。最后，派很多人带了很多绳索，费了很大气力，才把桑乔从那个坑里拉了上来。一个学生模样的人见状说道：\n “所有坏总督离职时都应该是这个样子，就像这个罪人从坑里出来时一样，饿得面无血色，而且看样子身无分文。”\n 桑乔听到后说道：\n “那位说话的老弟呀，在八天或十天以前，我得到了一个岛屿，当上了总督。在这段时间里，我从没有一刻吃饱过，而且有医生害我，有敌人踩疼了我的骨头；我既没有得到不义之财，也没有赚到钱。在这种情况下，我觉得我不该落得这样的下场。可是‘人生有命，富贵在天’，每个人怎样才好，上帝自有安排，只能听天由命，这话真绝了。‘以为那儿挂着咸肉，其实连挂肉的钩子也没有’。只要上帝理解我就够了，我也不再说什么了，尽管我还能说。”\n “你不要生气，桑乔，也不必为别人说什么而发火，那就没完了。你只要问心无愧就行，别人爱说什么就让他们去说吧；若想管住多嘴人的舌头，只能是螳臂当车。如果总督离任时发了财，人们就会说他是盗贼；如果他离任时没钱，人们就会说他是傻瓜笨蛋。”\n “我敢肯定，”桑乔说，“这次人们不会说我是盗贼，只会说我是笨蛋。”\n 他们就这样边走边说，由许多大人和孩子簇拥着回到公爵的城堡。公爵和公爵夫人正在走廊里等着唐吉诃德和桑乔。可桑乔还是先到马厩把他的驴安顿好，才去见公爵和公爵夫人，解释说他的驴前一天晚上已经受了不少罪。桑乔见到公爵和公爵夫人时双膝跪地，说道：\n “两位大人，我按照你们的意愿，而并非自己有此能力，到巴拉塔里亚岛当了总督，结果来去赤条条，没亏也没赚。至于我这个总督当得好不好，这儿自有证人，他们可以随便说。我判明了疑案，解决了争端，总是饥肠辘辘，因为岛上总督的医生，那个蒂尔特亚富埃拉的佩德罗·雷西奥大夫，总让我这样。敌人趁夜向我们进攻，情况十分危急，岛上的人说只有靠我的臂膀的力量，他们才能安然无恙，取得胜利。他们说的是实话，愿上帝保佑他们身体健康。反正经过这段时间，我已经体会到了总督的重负和责任，而且也意识到我的肩膀和肋骨，还有我的承受能力，都不足以担负起如此的重负和责任。所以，与其让总督职务把我解除，还不如我先把总督职务解除了。昨天早晨我离开了海岛，走过了我去岛上时走过的街道和房子。我没有向任何人借过钱，也没有赚到一点儿钱。我本来想颁布几个有益的法令，可是我没有颁布，怕它们得不到遵守，那就等于没颁布一样。就像我刚才说的，我只身一人离开了海岛，只有我的驴陪伴我。我走过一个坑边时摔了进去，今天早晨，出了太阳，我才看到出口。出来可不那么容易，若不是老天派我的主人唐吉诃德去救我，我肯定就死在那儿了。所以，我的公爵大人和公爵夫人，你们的总督桑乔·潘萨就在你们面前。他当了十天总督，所得的收获就是认识到，别说当一个海岛的总督，就是当全世界的总督，他也无所谓了。他就是带着这个想法前来吻你们的脚，而且还模仿着孩子们做游戏的话说：‘你跳来，我跳去。’现在我从总督的位置上跳出来，再回来服侍我的主人唐吉诃德。同他在一起，虽然吃饭时常担惊受怕，我也知足了。无论是熊掌还是鱼，对我来说都一样。”\n 桑乔就这样长篇大论地说了一通。唐吉诃德本来怕桑乔说起话来又是漏洞百出，见桑乔这么快就说完了，直在心里感谢老天。公爵拥抱了桑乔，说他从心里对桑乔如此迅速地离开了总督职务感到遗憾，不过他会尽力为桑乔物色一个担子轻可是油水大的差事干。公爵夫人也拥抱了桑乔，并且吩咐家人好好招待桑乔，因为看样子桑乔伤得不轻，情绪也不佳。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4676.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
