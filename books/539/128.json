{"id":42268,"no":128,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 74","content":"As nothing that is man’s can last for ever, but all tends ever downwards from its beginning to its end, and above all man’s life, and as Don Quixote’s enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven to stay its course, its end and close came when he least looked for it. For — whether it was of the dejection the thought of his defeat produced, or of heaven’s will that so ordered it — a fever settled upon him and kept him in his bed for six days, during which he was often visited by his friends the curate, the bachelor, and the barber, while his good squire Sancho Panza never quitted his bedside. They, persuaded that it was grief at finding himself vanquished, and the object of his heart, the liberation and disenchantment of Dulcinea, unattained, that kept him in this state, strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up; the bachelor bidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life, for which he himself, he said, had already composed an eclogue that would take the shine out of all Sannazaro had ever written, and had bought with his own money two famous dogs to guard the flock, one called Barcino and the other Butron, which a herdsman of Quintanar had sold him.\n But for all this Don Quixote could not shake off his sadness. His friends called in the doctor, who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfied with it, and said that in any case it would be well for him to attend to the health of his soul, as that of his body was in a bad way. Don Quixote heard this calmly; but not so his housekeeper, his niece, and his squire, who fell weeping bitterly, as if they had him lying dead before them. The doctor’s opinion was that melancholy and depression were bringing him to his end. Don Quixote begged them to leave him to himself, as he had a wish to sleep a little. They obeyed, and he slept at one stretch, as the saying is, more than six hours, so that the housekeeper and niece thought he was going to sleep for ever. But at the end of that time he woke up, and in a loud voice exclaimed, “Blessed be Almighty God, who has shown me such goodness. In truth his mercies are boundless, and the sins of men can neither limit them nor keep them back!”\n The niece listened with attention to her uncle’s words, and they struck her as more coherent than what usually fell from him, at least during his illness, so she asked, “What are you saying, senor? Has anything strange occurred? What mercies or what sins of men are you talking of?”\n “The mercies, niece,” said Don Quixote, “are those that God has this moment shown me, and with him, as I said, my sins are no impediment to them. My reason is now free and clear, rid of the dark shadows of ignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestable books of chivalry cast over it. Now I see through their absurdities and deceptions, and it only grieves me that this destruction of my illusions has come so late that it leaves me no time to make some amends by reading other books that might be a light to my soul. Niece, I feel myself at the point of death, and I would fain meet it in such a way as to show that my life has not been so ill that I should leave behind me the name of a madman; for though I have been one, I would not that the fact should be made plainer at my death. Call in to me, my dear, my good friends the curate, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, and Master Nicholas the barber, for I wish to confess and make my will.” But his niece was saved the trouble by the entrance of the three. The instant Don Quixote saw them he exclaimed, “Good news for you, good sirs, that I am no longer Don Quixote of La Mancha, but Alonso Quixano, whose way of life won for him the name of Good. Now am I the enemy of Amadis of Gaul and of the whole countless troop of his descendants; odious to me now are all the profane stories of knight-errantry; now I perceive my folly, and the peril into which reading them brought me; now, by God’s mercy schooled into my right senses, I loathe them.”\n When the three heard him speak in this way, they had no doubt whatever that some new craze had taken possession of him; and said Samson, “What? Senor Don Quixote! Now that we have intelligence of the lady Dulcinea being disenchanted, are you taking this line; now, just as we are on the point of becoming shepherds, to pass our lives singing, like princes, are you thinking of turning hermit? Hush, for heaven’s sake, be rational and let’s have no more nonsense.”\n “All that nonsense,” said Don Quixote, “that until now has been a reality to my hurt, my death will, with heaven’s help, turn to my good. I feel, sirs, that I am rapidly drawing near death; a truce to jesting; let me have a confessor to confess me, and a notary to make my will; for in extremities like this, man must not trifle with his soul; and while the curate is confessing me let some one, I beg, go for the notary.”\n They looked at one another, wondering at Don Quixote’s words; but, though uncertain, they were inclined to believe him, and one of the signs by which they came to the conclusion he was dying was this so sudden and complete return to his senses after having been mad; for to the words already quoted he added much more, so well expressed, so devout, and so rational, as to banish all doubt and convince them that he was sound of mind. The curate turned them all out, and left alone with him confessed him. The bachelor went for the notary and returned shortly afterwards with him and with Sancho, who, having already learned from the bachelor the condition his master was in, and finding the housekeeper and niece weeping, began to blubber and shed tears.\n The confession over, the curate came out saying, “Alonso Quixano the Good is indeed dying, and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go in to him while he makes his will.”\n This news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the housekeeper, niece, and Sancho Panza his good squire, making the tears burst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of a truth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain Alonso Quixano the Good, or as Don Quixote of La Mancha, Don Quixote was always of a gentle disposition and kindly in all his ways, and hence he was beloved, not only by those of his own house, but by all who knew him.\n The notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of the had been set out and Don Quixote had commended his soul to God with all the devout formalities that are usual, coming to the bequests, he said, “Item, it is my will that, touching certain moneys in the hands of Sancho Panza (whom in my madness I made my squire), inasmuch as between him and me there have been certain accounts and debits and credits, no claim be made against him, nor any account demanded of him in respect of them; but that if anything remain over and above, after he has paid himself what I owe him, the balance, which will be but little, shall be his, and much good may it do him; and if, as when I was mad I had a share in giving him the government of an island, so, now that I am in my senses, I could give him that of a kingdom, it should be his, for the simplicity of his character and the fidelity of his conduct deserve it.” And then, turning to Sancho, he said, “Forgive me, my friend, that I led thee to seem as mad as myself, making thee fall into the same error I myself fell into, that there were and still are knights-errant in the world.”\n “Ah!” said Sancho weeping, “don’t die, master, but take my advice and live many years; for the foolishest thing a man can do in this life is to let himself die without rhyme or reason, without anybody killing him, or any hands but melancholy’s making an end of him. Come, don’t be lazy, but get up from your bed and let us take to the fields in shepherd’s trim as we agreed. Perhaps behind some bush we shall find the lady Dulcinea disenchanted, as fine as fine can be. If it be that you are dying of vexation at having been vanquished, lay the blame on me, and say you were overthrown because I had girthed Rocinante badly; besides you must have seen in your books of chivalry that it is a common thing for knights to upset one another, and for him who is conquered to-day to be conqueror tomorrow.”\n “Very true,” said Samson, “and good Sancho Panza’s view of these cases is quite right.”\n “Sirs, not so fast,” said Don Quixote, “‘in last year’s nests there are no birds this year.’ I was mad, now I am in my senses; I was Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am now, as I said, Alonso Quixano the Good; and may my repentance and sincerity restore me to the esteem you used to have for me; and now let Master Notary proceed.\n “Item, I leave all my property absolutely to Antonia Quixana my niece, here present, after all has been deducted from the most available portion of it that may be required to satisfy the bequests I have made. And the first disbursement I desire to be made is the payment of the wages I owe for the time my housekeeper has served me, with twenty ducats, over and above, for a gown. The curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco, now present, I appoint my executors.\n “Item, it is my wish that if Antonia Quixana, my niece, desires to marry, she shall marry a man of whom it shall be first of all ascertained by information taken that he does not know what books of chivalry are; and if it should be proved that he does, and if, in spite of this, my niece insists upon marrying him, and does marry him, then that she shall forfeit the whole of what I have left her, which my executors shall devote to works of charity as they please.\n “Item, I entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executors, that, if any happy chance should lead them to discover the author who is said to have written a history now going about under the title of ‘Second Part of the Achievements of Don Quixote of La Mancha,’ they beg of him on my behalf as earnestly as they can to forgive me for having been, without intending it, the cause of his writing so many and such monstrous absurdities as he has written in it; for I am leaving the world with a feeling of compunction at having provoked him to write them.”\n With this he closed his will, and a faintness coming over him he stretched himself out at full length on the bed. All were in a flutter and made haste to relieve him, and during the three days he lived after that on which he made his will he fainted away very often. The house was all in confusion; but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drank and Sancho Panza enjoyed himself; for inheriting property wipes out or softens down in the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might be expected to leave behind him.\n \n At last Don Quixote’s end came, after he had received all the sacraments, and had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestation of books of chivalry. The notary was there at the time, and he said that in no book of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his bed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tears and lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to say died. On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had passed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he desired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and making interminable stories out of his achievements.\n Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer. The lamentations of Sancho and the niece and housekeeper are omitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon his tomb; Samson Carrasco, however, put the following lines:\n A doughty gentleman lies here;\n A stranger all his life to fear;\n Nor in his death could Death prevail,\n In that last hour, to make him quail.\n He for the world but little cared;\n And at his feats the world was scared;\n A crazy man his life he passed,\n But in his senses died at last.\n And said most sage Cide Hamete to his pen, “Rest here, hung up by this brass wire, upon this shelf, O my pen, whether of skilful make or clumsy cut I know not; here shalt thou remain long ages hence, unless presumptuous or malignant story-tellers take thee down to profane thee. But ere they touch thee warn them, and, as best thou canst, say to them:\n Hold off! ye weaklings; hold your hands!\n Adventure it let none,\n For this emprise, my lord the king,\n Was meant for me alone.\n For me alone was Don Quixote born, and I for him; it was his to act, mine to write; we two together make but one, notwithstanding and in spite of that pretended Tordesillesque writer who has ventured or would venture with his great, coarse, ill-trimmed ostrich quill to write the achievements of my valiant knight; — no burden for his shoulders, nor subject for his frozen wit: whom, if perchance thou shouldst come to know him, thou shalt warn to leave at rest where they lie the weary mouldering bones of Don Quixote, and not to attempt to carry him off, in opposition to all the privileges of death, to Old Castile, making him rise from the grave where in reality and truth he lies stretched at full length, powerless to make any third expedition or new sally; for the two that he has already made, so much to the enjoyment and approval of everybody to whom they have become known, in this as well as in foreign countries, are quite sufficient for the purpose of turning into ridicule the whole of those made by the whole set of the knights-errant; and so doing shalt thou discharge thy Christian calling, giving good counsel to one that bears ill-will to thee. And I shall remain satisfied, and proud to have been the first who has ever enjoyed the fruit of his writings as fully as he could desire; for my desire has been no other than to deliver over to the detestation of mankind the false and foolish tales of the books of chivalry, which, thanks to that of my true Don Quixote, are even now tottering, and doubtless doomed to fall for ever. Farewell.”\n \n 人世间一切事物，无不经历了由兴至衰并且最后导致消亡的历程，特别是人的生命。唐吉诃德的生命也并未得到老天的特别关照，因而不知不觉地走了下坡路。也许是因为他被打败了，心中郁郁不乐，也许是因为老天的安排，他高烧不退，在床上躺了六天。神甫、学士和理发师常常来看他，桑乔也一直守在他床边。他们估计，唐吉诃德是因为被打败造成的忧伤，以及未能实现他为杜尔西内亚解除魔法的初衷而病倒的，便尽可能地为他宽心。学士叫唐吉诃德振作起精神来，准备过牧羊人的生活，为此他还写了一首牧歌，可以说超过了萨纳萨罗①所有的诗；此外，他还花钱买了两只著名的牧羊犬，一只叫巴尔西诺，另一只叫布特龙，是一个叫金塔纳尔的牧人卖给他的；可是，唐吉诃德仍然愁眉不展。\n ①萨纳萨罗是意大利诗人，曾出版诗集《牧人乐园》。\n 朋友们又为唐吉诃德请来了大夫。大夫号了脉，说情况不好，现在无论如何得先拯救他的灵魂，他的身体已经很危险了。唐吉诃德听了以后很镇静，可是女管家、外甥女和侍从却伤心地哭了起来，好像唐吉诃德已经死到临头了。大夫认为忧郁是唐吉诃德的病根。唐吉诃德说，他想一个人呆一会儿，睡一会儿觉。大家出去了，唐吉诃德一下子就睡了六个小时。女管家和外甥女生怕唐吉诃德一下子睡过去，可他醒来后却大声说道：\n “感谢万能的上帝，给了我如此的恩典。上帝慈悲无量，盖过了世人所有的罪孽！”\n 外甥女仔细听着，觉得他的谈吐比以前清醒了，至少比生病期间清醒了，便问道：\n “您说什么呀？咱们又得了什么新的恩典？慈悲是怎么回事？罪孽是怎么回事？”\n “慈悲就是上帝现在对我发的慈悲。”唐吉诃德说，“外甥女，我刚才说，他的慈悲盖过了世人所有的罪孽。他恢复了我的理智，使我不再受任何干扰。过去，我老是读那些该死的骑士小说，给自己罩上了无知的阴云。现在，这些阴云已荡然无存。我已清楚那些书纯属胡说八道，只是深悔自己觉悟太迟，没有时间去研读一些启迪心灵智慧的书来补救了。外甥女啊，我发现自己死期已至，尽管我一生都被别人当成疯子，我在死时却不愿如此。孩子，去把我的好朋友神甫、卡拉斯科学士和尼古拉斯师傅叫来吧，我要忏悔和立遗嘱。”\n 这三个人正好进来了。唐吉诃德一见到他们就说：\n “善良的大人们，我有个好消息，我不再是曼查的唐吉诃德了，而是阿隆索·基哈诺，人们习惯称我为‘大好人’。我现在把高卢的阿马迪斯和他的世代家族视为仇敌，对所有荒诞不经的骑士小说弃如敝屣。我意识到了阅读这些小说的愚蠢性和危险性。靠上帝的慈悲，我现在已翻然悔悟，对骑士小说深恶痛绝了。”\n 三个人听了都以为唐吉诃德又发疯了。参孙说道：\n “唐吉诃德大人，您这是怎么了？我们刚刚得到消息说，杜尔西内亚夫人已经摆脱了魔法。现在咱们马上就要去当牧人，过无忧无虑、无拘无束的生活了，您怎么又临阵退缩呢？\n 您清醒清醒，别再说了。”\n “正是那些东西害了我一辈子，”唐吉诃德说，“靠老天帮忙，但愿在我临死前，它们能对我转害为益。大人们，我觉得我现在已行将就木，别再耍弄我了。请你们找个忏悔神父和公证人来吧，我要立遗嘱。在这种时刻不应该拿人的灵魂开玩笑。所以，我请神甫听我忏悔，其他人去找公证人来。”\n 大家听了唐吉诃德的话十分惊奇，面面相觑。尽管他们仍有所怀疑，但还是愿意相信这件事，料想是唐吉诃德快死了，因此由疯癫变得明智了。他还说了许多虚诚而有道理的话，证明他确实已经恢复正常了。\n 神甫让大家出去，他自己留下听唐吉诃德忏悔。学士去找公证人，一会儿就和桑乔一起回来了。桑乔听学士介绍了唐吉诃德现在的状况，又见女管家和外甥女哭哭啼啼，也抽泣起来，泪流满面。唐吉诃德忏悔完，神甫出来说道：\n “这个神智清醒的大好人阿隆索·基哈诺真是要死了，咱们进去为他立遗嘱吧。”\n 女管家、外甥女和唐吉诃德的好侍从桑乔听到这话泪水又夺眶而出，而且哽咽不止。前面讲过，无论在这个唐吉诃德确实是大好人阿隆索·基哈诺的时候，还是在后来成了曼查的唐吉诃德以后，都性情温和，待人厚道，所以不仅家里人喜欢他，村里所有认识他的人也都喜欢他。公证人跟着大家来到唐吉诃德的房间里，准备好了遗嘱的开头格式。在为唐吉诃德的灵魂祝福后，人们又按照基督教的规定举行了仪式，然后唐吉诃德说道：\n “遗嘱内容：我曾自愿将一笔钱交给桑乔·潘萨掌管。在我疯癫的时期，他充当了我的侍从。现在，我们之间的帐目和纠葛我不再追究，他也不必再向我交代帐目。如果除了我欠他的款项之外还略有结余，也全部都归他所有，但愿能对他有所帮助。在我疯癫之时，我曾让他出任岛屿的总督，现在我并不糊涂，如果可能的话，我将让他出任一个王国的国王，他忠厚老实，受之无愧。”\n 唐吉诃德又转过头对桑乔说：\n “朋友，请原谅我把你害得像我和世界上的所有游侠骑士一样疯疯癫癫。”\n “哎哟，”桑乔哭着说道，“您可别死呀。您听听我的劝，长命百岁吧。一个人最大的疯癫就是让自己无缘无故地死去！现在既没人杀您，也没人打您，您可别因为忧郁就结束了自己的性命。您别犯懒了，从床上爬起来，咱们按照约定的那样，穿上牧人的服装到野外去吧，也许咱们能在某一丛灌木后面碰到杜尔西内亚呢，肯定能碰到！如果您因为战败而忧郁致死，那全都怨我，是我没把罗西南多的肚带拴好，让它把您摔了下来。况且，您在那些骑士小说里也见到过，一些骑士被另外一些骑士打败是常有的事，今日败，明天又会胜嘛。”\n “是这样，”参孙说道，“桑乔这些话说得确实很对。”\n “诸位大人，”唐吉诃德说，“且听我说，一朝天子一朝臣。我过去是疯子，现在不疯了；我以前是曼查的唐吉诃德，现在就像刚才我说过的，我是大好人阿隆索·基哈诺。但愿诸位见我真心忏悔，能够像以前一样尊重我。请继续写下去吧，公证人大人。\n “内容：除去应扣除的款项外，将我的全部财产遗赠给我在场的外甥女安东尼娅·基哈娜，但首先应支付女管家在我家做工期间应得到的全部报酬，另外再加二十个杜卡多和一件衣服。我指定在场的神甫大人和参孙·卡拉斯科学士大人为遗嘱执行人。\n “内容：如果我的外甥女安东尼娅·基哈娜愿意结婚，她必须嫁给一个经查明对骑士小说一无所知的人；若查明此人读过骑士小说，而我的外甥女仍然愿意同他结婚，并且同他结了婚，我将收回我的成命，由我的遗嘱执行人将我的财产捐赠给慈善机构。\n “内容：我请求上述遗嘱执行人，如果遇到那位据说是撰写了《唐吉诃德》下卷的作者，请代我向他竭诚致歉。我竟意想不到地促成他写了这部荒谬绝伦的小说，对此我深感不安。”\n 立完遗嘱，唐吉诃德昏了过去，直挺挺地躺在床上。大家七手八脚地赶紧抢救，就这样醒过来又昏过去地持续了三天。\n 唐吉诃德家里乱成一团，不过，外甥女照常吃饭，女管家依然喝酒，桑乔情绪也还行，因为继承的财产多多少少减轻了继承者怀念垂死者的悲伤。最后，唐吉诃德接受了各种圣礼，又慷慨陈词地抨击了骑士小说之后便溘然长逝了。公证人当时在场，他说，他从未在任何一本骑士小说里看到过任何一个游侠骑士像唐吉诃德这样安然死在了床上。唐吉诃德在亲友的同情和眼泪中魂归西天，也就是说他死了。\n 神甫见状立刻请公证人出具证明：人称曼查的唐吉诃德的大好人阿隆索·基哈诺已经过世，属自然死亡。神甫这样做是为了避免有人在锡德·哈迈德之后又杜撰唐吉诃德起死回生，建立了无穷无尽的英雄业绩等等。唐吉诃德从此告别了人间。关于他的家乡，锡德·哈迈德不愿明确指出来，以便让曼查所有村镇的人都以为自己是唐吉诃德的后代，就像希腊的六个城市都争说荷马是自己那个地方的人一样。\n 至于桑乔、外甥女和女管家如何哀悼唐吉诃德，我们姑且略去，只说参孙·卡拉斯科学士在唐吉诃德的墓碑上写的墓志铭吧：\n 高尚贵族，\n 长眠此地，\n 英勇绝伦，\n 虽死犹生，\n 功盖天地。\n 雄踞世界，\n 震憾寰宇，\n 身经百难，\n 生前疯癫，\n 死后颖异。\n 具有远见卓识的锡德·哈迈德又写道：“我的笔呀，我且把你搁置于此。你将存在几个世纪，也许会有某些文痞把你重新拿起，滥用一气。不过，不等他们下手，我就要用最好的方式告诉他们：\n 请不要碰这支笔，\n 不要那么卑鄙；\n 这项伟大的事业\n 专为我立。\n “唐吉诃德只为我而生，我也只为他而生；他能做，我能写，只有我们俩能够合二为一。托德西利亚斯的冒牌作家竟敢用他的拙笔刻画我们的英勇骑士的业绩，实在是力不从心，才思也不够功底。如果你碰到了他，就告诉他，还是让唐吉诃德那把老骨头安息吧。不要违背死亡的规律，让他又从墓地里跑出来，到旧卡斯蒂利亚去了①。他确实已经躺到了地下，不可能再作第三次出游了。他两次出征，已经让人们把游侠骑士的行径嘲弄得淋漓尽致了，无论是当地还是其他王国的人对此都很赞赏。你对怀有恶意的人好言相劝，已经尽到了你作为基督徒的义务。我的愿望无非是让人们对那些骑士小说里人物的荒诞行径深恶痛绝。现在，我首先享受到了这种成果，已经心满意足。由于我这本关于唐吉诃德的真实故事，骑士小说将日趋衰落，并且最终将彻底消亡。\n 再见。\n ①那本伪作说，唐吉诃德从疯人院出来后又去了旧卡斯蒂利亚等地方。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4695.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
