{"id":42199,"no":59,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 5","content":"The translator of this history, when he comes to write this fifth chapter, says that he considers it apocryphal, because in it Sancho Panza speaks in a style unlike that which might have been expected from his limited intelligence, and says things so subtle that he does not think it possible he could have conceived them; however, desirous of doing what his task imposed upon him, he was unwilling to leave it untranslated, and therefore he went on to say: Sancho came home in such glee and spirits that his wife noticed his happiness a bowshot off, so much so that it made her ask him, “What have you got, Sancho friend, that you are so glad?” To which he replied, “Wife, if it were God’s will, I should be very glad not to be so well pleased as I show myself.” “I don’t understand you, husband,” said she, “and I don’t know what you mean by saying you would be glad, if it were God’s will, not to be well pleased; for, fool as I am, I don’t know how one can find pleasure in not having it.” “Hark ye, Teresa,” replied Sancho, “I am glad because I have made up my mind to go back to the service of my master Don Quixote, who means to go out a third time to seek for adventures; and I am going with him again, for my necessities will have it so, and also the hope that cheers me with the thought that I may find another hundred crowns like those we have spent; though it makes me sad to have to leave thee and the children; and if God would be pleased to let me have my daily bread, dry-shod and at home, without taking me out into the byways and cross-roads — and he could do it at small cost by merely willing it — it is clear my happiness would be more solid and lasting, for the happiness I have is mingled with sorrow at leaving thee; so that I was right in saying I would be glad, if it were God’s will, not to be well pleased.” “Look here, Sancho,” said Teresa; “ever since you joined on to a knight-errant you talk in such a roundabout way that there is no understanding you.” “It is enough that God understands me, wife,” replied Sancho; “for he is the understander of all things; that will do; but mind, sister, you must look to Dapple carefully for the next three days, so that he may be fit to take arms; double his feed, and see to the pack-saddle and other harness, for it is not to a wedding we are bound, but to go round the world, and play at give and take with giants and dragons and monsters, and hear hissings and roarings and bellowings and howlings; and even all this would be lavender, if we had not to reckon with Yanguesans and enchanted Moors.” “I know well enough, husband,” said Teresa, “that squires-errant don’t eat their bread for nothing, and so I will be always praying to our Lord to deliver you speedily from all that hard fortune.” “I can tell you, wife,” said Sancho, “if I did not expect to see myself governor of an island before long, I would drop down dead on the spot.” “Nay, then, husband,” said Teresa; “let the hen live, though it be with her pip, live, and let the devil take all the governments in the world; you came out of your mother’s womb without a government, you have lived until now without a government, and when it is God’s will you will go, or be carried, to your grave without a government. How many there are in the world who live without a government, and continue to live all the same, and are reckoned in the number of the people. The best sauce in the world is hunger, and as the poor are never without that, they always eat with a relish. But mind, Sancho, if by good luck you should find yourself with some government, don’t forget me and your children. Remember that Sanchico is now full fifteen, and it is right he should go to school, if his uncle the abbot has a mind to have him trained for the Church. Consider, too, that your daughter Mari-Sancha will not die of grief if we marry her; for I have my suspicions that she is as eager to get a husband as you to get a government; and, after all, a daughter looks better ill married than well whored.” “By my faith,” replied Sancho, “if God brings me to get any sort of a government, I intend, wife, to make such a high match for Mari-Sancha that there will be no approaching her without calling her ‘my lady.” “Nay, Sancho,” returned Teresa; “marry her to her equal, that is the safest plan; for if you put her out of wooden clogs into high-heeled shoes, out of her grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silk gowns, out of the plain ‘Marica’ and ‘thou,’ into ‘Dona So-and-so’ and ‘my lady,’ the girl won’t know where she is, and at every turn she will fall into a thousand blunders that will show the thread of her coarse homespun stuff.” “Tut, you fool,” said Sancho; “it will be only to practise it for two or three years; and then dignity and decorum will fit her as easily as a glove; and if not, what matter? Let her he ‘my lady,’ and never mind what happens.” “Keep to your own station, Sancho,” replied Teresa; “don’t try to raise yourself higher, and bear in mind the proverb that says, ‘wipe the nose of your neigbbour’s son, and take him into your house.’ A fine thing it would be, indeed, to marry our Maria to some great count or grand gentleman, who, when the humour took him, would abuse her and call her clown-bred and clodhopper’s daughter and spinning wench. I have not been bringing up my daughter for that all this time, I can tell you, husband. Do you bring home money, Sancho, and leave marrying her to my care; there is Lope Tocho, Juan Tocho’s son, a stout, sturdy young fellow that we know, and I can see he does not look sour at the girl; and with him, one of our own sort, she will be well married, and we shall have her always under our eyes, and be all one family, parents and children, grandchildren and sons-in-law, and the peace and blessing of God will dwell among us; so don’t you go marrying her in those courts and grand palaces where they won’t know what to make of her, or she what to make of herself.” “Why, you idiot and wife for Barabbas,” said Sancho, “what do you mean by trying, without why or wherefore, to keep me from marrying my daughter to one who will give me grandchildren that will be called ‘your lordship’? Look ye, Teresa, I have always heard my elders say that he who does not know how to take advantage of luck when it comes to him, has no right to complain if it gives him the go-by; and now that it is knocking at our door, it will not do to shut it out; let us go with the favouring breeze that blows upon us.” It is this sort of talk, and what Sancho says lower down, that made the translator of the history say he considered this chapter apocryphal. “Don’t you see, you animal,” continued Sancho, “that it will be well for me to drop into some profitable government that will lift us out of the mire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I like; and you yourself will find yourself called ‘Dona Teresa Panza,’ and sitting in church on a fine carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of all the born ladies of the town? No, stay as you are, growing neither greater nor less, like a tapestry figure — Let us say no more about it, for Sanchica shall be a countess, say what you will.” “Are you sure of all you say, husband?” replied Teresa. “Well, for all that, I am afraid this rank of countess for my daughter will be her ruin. You do as you like, make a duchess or a princess of her, but I can tell you it will not be with my will and consent. I was always a lover of equality, brother, and I can’t bear to see people give themselves airs without any right. They called me Teresa at my baptism, a plain, simple name, without any additions or tags or fringes of Dons or Donas; Cascajo was my father’s name, and as I am your wife, I am called Teresa Panza, though by right I ought to he called Teresa Cascajo; but ‘kings go where laws like,’ and I am content with this name without having the ‘Don’ put on top of it to make it so heavy that I cannot carry it; and I don’t want to make people talk about me when they see me go dressed like a countess or governor’s wife; for they will say at once, ‘See what airs the slut gives herself! Only yesterday she was always spinning flax, and used to go to mass with the tail of her petticoat over her head instead of a mantle, and there she goes to-day in a hooped gown with her broaches and airs, as if we didn’t know her!’ If God keeps me in my seven senses, or five, or whatever number I have, I am not going to bring myself to such a pass; go you, brother, and be a government or an island man, and swagger as much as you like; for by the soul of my mother, neither my daughter nor I are going to stir a step from our village; a respectable woman should have a broken leg and keep at home; and to he busy at something is a virtuous damsel’s holiday; be off to your adventures along with your Don Quixote, and leave us to our misadventures, for God will mend them for us according as we deserve it. I don’t know, I’m sure, who fixed the ‘Don’ to him, what neither his father nor grandfather ever had.” “I declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body!” said Sancho. “God help thee, what a lot of things thou hast strung together, one after the other, without head or tail! What have Cascajo, and the broaches and the proverbs and the airs, to do with what I say? Look here, fool and dolt (for so I may call you, when you don’t understand my words, and run away from good fortune), if I had said that my daughter was to throw herself down from a tower, or go roaming the world, as the Infanta Dona Urraca wanted to do, you would be right in not giving way to my will; but if in an instant, in less than the twinkling of an eye, I put the ‘Don’ and ‘my lady’ on her back, and take her out of the stubble, and place her under a canopy, on a dais, and on a couch, with more velvet cushions than all the Almohades of Morocco ever had in their family, why won’t you consent and fall in with my wishes?” “Do you know why, husband?” replied Teresa; “because of the proverb that says ‘who covers thee, discovers thee.’ At the poor man people only throw a hasty glance; on the rich man they fix their eyes; and if the said rich man was once on a time poor, it is then there is the sneering and the tattle and spite of backbiters; and in the streets here they swarm as thick as bees.” “Look here, Teresa,” said Sancho, “and listen to what I am now going to say to you; maybe you never heard it in all your life; and I do not give my own notions, for what I am about to say are the opinions of his reverence the preacher, who preached in this town last Lent, and who said, if I remember rightly, that all things present that our eyes behold, bring themselves before us, and remain and fix themselves on our memory much better and more forcibly than things past.” These observations which Sancho makes here are the other ones on account of which the translator says he regards this chapter as apocryphal, inasmuch as they are beyond Sancho’s capacity. “Whence it arises,” he continued, “that when we see any person well dressed and making a figure with rich garments and retinue of servants, it seems to lead and impel us perforce to respect him, though memory may at the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in which we have seen him, but which, whether it may have been poverty or low birth, being now a thing of the past, has no existence; while the only thing that has any existence is what we see before us; and if this person whom fortune has raised from his original lowly state (these were the very words the padre used) to his present height of prosperity, be well bred, generous, courteous to all, without seeking to vie with those whose nobility is of ancient date, depend upon it, Teresa, no one will remember what he was, and everyone will respect what he is, except indeed the envious, from whom no fair fortune is safe.” “I do not understand you, husband,” replied Teresa; “do as you like, and don’t break my head with any more speechifying and rethoric; and if you have revolved to do what you say — ” “Resolved, you should say, woman,” said Sancho, “not revolved.” “Don’t set yourself to wrangle with me, husband,” said Teresa; “I speak as God pleases, and don’t deal in out-of-the-way phrases; and I say if you are bent upon having a government, take your son Sancho with you, and teach him from this time on how to hold a government; for sons ought to inherit and learn the trades of their fathers.” “As soon as I have the government,” said Sancho, “I will send for him by post, and I will send thee money, of which I shall have no lack, for there is never any want of people to lend it to governors when they have not got it; and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is and make him look what he is to be.” “You send the money,” said Teresa, “and I’ll dress him up for you as fine as you please.” “Then we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess,” said Sancho. “The day that I see her a countess,” replied Teresa, “it will be the same to me as if I was burying her; but once more I say do as you please, for we women are born to this burden of being obedient to our husbands, though they be dogs;” and with this she began to weep in earnest, as if she already saw Sanchica dead and buried. Sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess, he would put it off as long as possible. Here their conversation came to an end, and Sancho went back to see Don Quixote, and make arrangements for their departure. 这部小说的译者译到第五章时，怀疑这部分是伪造的，因为桑乔在此处的妙论不同于以往那样傻话连篇，而是言语精辟，这在桑乔是不可能的。不过，译者并没有因此而不履行自己的职责，还是照译如下： 桑乔兴高采烈地回家去了。他的妻子从远处就看到了他那高兴的样子，忍不住问他： “你怎么了，桑乔，干吗乐成这个样子？” 桑乔回答说： “我的老伴儿呀，但愿上帝能让我不像现在这样高兴，我才乐意呢。” “我不明白，老伴儿，”她说道，“你说，但愿上帝能让你不像现在这样高兴你才乐意呢，这是什么意思？我虽然傻，却没听说过有谁不高兴才称心如意呢。” “你看，特雷莎，”桑乔说，“我高兴是因为我已经决定再次去服侍我的主人唐吉诃德，他要第三次出去征险了。我又跟他出去是因为我需要这样，而且我还指望这次能再找到一百个盾呢。我正是为此而高兴的。那一百个盾咱们已经花掉了。不过，要离开你和孩子我又难过。如果上帝能够让我不必在外颠沛流离，而是在家里坐享清福，我当然更高兴了。现在，我是既高兴又掺着与你分别的痛苦，所以我刚才说，如果上帝不让我像现在这样高兴我才乐意呢。” “你看你，桑乔，”特雷莎说，“自从你跟了游侠骑士以后，说话总是拐弯抹角的，谁也听不懂。” “上帝能听懂就行了，老伴儿，”桑乔说，“上帝无所不懂。咱们就说到这儿吧，这三天你最好先照看好驴，让它能时刻整装待发。你要加倍喂料，仔细检查驮鞍和其他鞍具。我们不是去参加婚礼，而是去游历世界，遇到的是巨人和妖魔鬼怪，听到的是各种鬼哭狼嚎。如果不碰上杨瓜斯人和会魔法的摩尔人，这些都算小事哩。” “我完全相信，老伴儿，”特雷莎说，“游侠侍从这碗饭也不是白吃的。我会祈求上帝让你尽早脱离这个倒霉的行当。” “我告诉你，老伴儿呀，”桑乔说，“要不是想到我要当岛屿的总督，我早就死在这儿了。” “别这样，我的丈夫，”特雷莎说，“‘鸡就是长了舌疮也得活呀’。你可得活着，让世界上所有的总督都见鬼去吧。你没当总督也从你娘肚子里出来了，没当总督也活到了现在；不当总督，若是上帝让你去坟墓，你就是自己不愿去，也会有人把你送去的。世界上那么多人没当总督，人家也没有因此就活不下去，也没有因此就不是人了。世界上最好的调味汁就是饥饿，而穷人从来不缺饿，所以吃东西总是那么香。不过你听着，桑乔，万一你当了什么总督，一定别忘了我和你的孩子们。你看，小桑乔已经满十五岁了，如果你那位当修道院院长的叔叔想让他以后当神甫，也该让他去学习了。你再看看你的女儿玛丽·桑查吧，如果不让她结婚，她非死了不可。现在越来越看得出来，她特别想有个丈夫，就像你想当总督似的。反正，当个不如意的老婆也比当高级姘头强。” “我明白，”桑乔说，“如果上帝让我当个总督什么的，我一定要让玛丽·桑查嫁给一个地位高的人。谁不能让她当上贵夫人就休想娶她。” “不，不，桑乔，”特雷莎说，“让她嫁给一个地位相当的人才合适。你要让她不穿木屐而换上软木厚底鞋，不穿粗呢裙而换上带裙撑的绸裙①，不叫玛丽，不以‘你’相称，而是称‘唐娜某某’或‘贵夫人’，那可不是她所能做到的，准得处处出洋相，露出她的粗陋本性来。” ①木屐和粗呢裙给穷人穿，厚底鞋和绸裙给富人穿。 “住嘴，你这个傻瓜，”桑乔说，“过两三年就都适应了，该有的派头和尊严也就有了。即使没有又怎么样呢？她还是贵夫人，想怎么办就怎么办。” “你看看自己的身份吧，桑乔，”特雷莎说，“别净想高攀了。你记着，俗话说，‘邻居的儿子在眼前，擦干净鼻子领进门’。咱们的玛丽若是真能嫁给一个伯爵或骑士，那当然是好事，可就怕他随意欺负玛丽，说她是乡巴佬、庄稼妹、纺织女。只要有我在就休想，老伴儿！她可是我养大的！你只管拿钱来，桑乔，她的婚事由我来办。我看好了，有个洛佩·托乔，是胡安·托乔的儿子，一个健壮又结实的小伙子，咱们都认识他。我知道他对咱们的女儿印象不错。门当户对，这门亲事错不了。而且，这样玛丽总在咱们眼皮底下，大家都是一家人，父母、儿女、孙子和女婿，大家和睦相处，共享天伦之乐。你别着急把她嫁到宫廷和王府去，在那儿人家与她合不到一起，她也与人家合不到一起。” “够了，你这个乱搅和的粗俗女人！”桑乔说，“你干吗平白无故地不让我把女儿嫁给那种能给我生‘高贵’孙子的人？你看，特雷莎，我总是听老人们说，‘福来不享，福走了就别怨’。现在福气已经来到咱家门口，咱们若是把门关上就不对了，咱们应该借此东风嘛。” 本书的译者认为，桑乔的这段话和下面的一段话都是杜撰的。 “你这个害人虫，”桑乔接着说，“如果我当上一个有油水的总督，咱们从此就翻了身，难道你觉得不好吗？我要把玛丽·桑查嫁给我选中的人，你看吧，到时候人们就会称你为‘唐娜特雷莎·潘萨’。不管那些贵夫人如何不愿意，你去教堂的时候都可以坐在细毯制的坐垫上，还有绸子。你不能一辈子总是这样，像个摆设似的。这件事不用再说了。不管你怎么讲，小桑查也得当个伯爵夫人。” “我看你说得太多了，老伴儿，”特雷莎说，“不管怎么说，我还是怕她当这个伯爵夫人或者王妃。我可告诉你，这并不是我的意思，我也没同意。伙计，我一直主张门当户对，最看不上那种自己本来什么也不是却要攀龙附凤的人。我洗礼时起的名字是特雷莎，这个名字多痛快，没有什么这个那个，还罗哩罗嗦地‘唐’什么、‘唐娜’什么的。我的父亲叫卡斯卡霍。我是你的女人，所以人家又叫我特雷莎·潘萨，本来我应该叫特雷莎·卡斯卡霍，可法律就是国王①，我对特雷莎·潘萨这个名字挺满意，不用加什么‘唐’，那我担当不起。我也不愿意让人见我穿得像个伯爵夫人或总督夫人似的，背后却说：‘你们看，那个喂猪婆还挺傲慢的，昨天还披着麻袋片，去教堂时没头巾，用裙摆包脑袋，今天就穿着带裙撑的裙子，戴着装饰别针，神气十足了，好像咱们不知道她是谁似的。’上帝让我七官或五官俱全，别管有几官吧，我才不想让人家这么说呢。你呢，伙计，去当你的总督或是岛督吧，愿意威风就威风去吧。可我和女儿，我向我已故的母亲发誓，我们绝不离开村子一步。好女就好比没有腿，大门不出，二门不迈。正派的女孩子，干活才是幸福。你跟随你的唐吉诃德去找你们的好运，让我们母女在家倒霉吧。我们是好人，上帝自然会帮助我们，让我们时来运转。我就是不明白，他的父母和祖父母都没有‘唐’的称号，是谁给他封了‘唐’字。” “我告诉你，”桑乔说，“你现在大概是中魔了。上帝保佑，老伴儿，你干吗要把这些没头没尾的事连在一起？我说的那些同碎石子②、首饰别针、俗话和神气有什么关系？听着，你这个笨蛋，我只得这么叫你，因为你总是听不明白我的话。我是说，假如让我的女儿从一个高塔上跳下来，或者沉沦堕落，就像乌拉卡公主③打算的那样，你或许有理由不按照我说的去做。可如果转眼之间，我就能给她安上一个‘唐娜’或贵夫人的头衔，让她脱离苦海，一步登天，让她的会客室里的阿尔摩哈达④比摩洛哥的阿尔摩哈达时期的摩尔人还多，你干吗不同意或不愿意让我这样做呢？” ①应为“国王就是法律”，特雷莎把话说反了。 ②特雷莎的父亲名叫卡斯卡霍。卡斯卡霍有碎石子的意思。 ③乌拉卡公主是西班牙国王费尔南多一世的女儿，见父亲把国土只分给她的三个兄弟，便威胁要去操皮肉生涯，迫使父亲给了她一个城。 ④此处为垫子的意思。穆瓦希德人也译为阿尔摩哈达人。两者发音相同。 “你知道为什么吗，老伴儿？”特雷莎说，“因为俗话说，‘看得见看不见全是他’。对穷人大家都视而不见，可是对富人就盯住不放。如果某个富人以前曾经是穷人，大家就议论纷纷，说东道西，没完没了。这种人大街上有的是，就像蜜蜂似的一堆一堆的。” “听着，特雷莎，”桑乔说，“你听我对你说句话，这句话也许你这辈子都没听说过，现在我来告诉你。我要说的这句话是一位神父上次四旬斋布道时讲的，如果我没记错的话，他说的是：‘眼前的东西明摆着，给人的印象比所有过去的东西都深刻。’” 桑乔的这些话又让译者怀疑本章部分是杜撰的，因为它已经超出了桑乔的能力。桑乔又接着说道： “所以，当我们看到某个人梳理整齐、穿着华丽而且有佣人前呼后拥的时候，就仿佛有一种力量使我们对他油然而生敬意，因为那个时刻产生的印象使我们不由自主地感到在他面前矮了一截儿，这就使人们忘记了他的过去，不管他过去是贫穷还是有身份，反正那都是过去的事了，人们只注意到他的现在。命运使这个人由卑微转为高贵，如果他有教养，人大方，对大家都很客气，不同那些世袭贵族闹什么不和，你放心，特雷莎，不会有人记得他的过去，而只会注重他的现在，除非是那种总爱嫉妒别人、看见别人富了就不高兴的家伙。神父说的就是这个意思。” “我听不懂你说的这些，老伴儿，”特雷莎说，“你想怎么办就怎么办吧，别在这儿长篇大论地让我头疼了。如果你决意要像你说的那样做……” “你应该说‘决定’，老伴儿，”桑乔说，“不是‘决意’。” “别跟我争，老伴儿。”特雷莎说，“上帝就是叫我这么说的，我不会说错的。我是说，你如果一定要当总督，就把你儿子小桑乔带走，让他从现在起就学着做总督吧。子继父业是完全正当的。” “我一当上总督，”桑乔说，“就会派人来接他，还会给你寄钱来。我肯定会有钱。当总督的如果没有钱，肯定会有人借给他。你也得穿得像个样子，别跟现在似的。” “你就寄你的钱来吧，”特雷莎说，“我肯定会穿得像个贵夫人。” “那咱们就商定了，”桑乔说，“让咱们的女儿做个伯爵夫人。” “等我看到她当了伯爵夫人，”特雷莎说，“我就当她已经死了埋了。不过，我再说一遍，你愿意怎么做就怎么做，反正我们女人生来就是这个命，嫁鸡随鸡，嫁狗随狗。” 说到这儿，特雷莎哭起来，仿佛她已经看见小桑查死了埋了似的。桑乔安慰她说，他们的女儿肯定会做伯爵夫人，不过他会安排得尽可能晚些。他们的谈话就这样结束了。桑乔又去看望唐吉诃德，准备收拾启程。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4626.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
