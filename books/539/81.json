{"id":42221,"no":81,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 27","content":"Cide Hamete, the chronicler of this great history, begins this chapter with these words, “I swear as a Catholic Christian;” with regard to which his translator says that Cide Hamete’s swearing as a Catholic Christian, he being — as no doubt he was — a Moor, only meant that, just as a Catholic Christian taking an oath swears, or ought to swear, what is true, and tell the truth in what he avers, so he was telling the truth, as much as if he swore as a Catholic Christian, in all he chose to write about Quixote, especially in declaring who Master Pedro was and what was the divining ape that astonished all the villages with his divinations. He says, then, that he who has read the First Part of this history will remember well enough the Gines de Pasamonte whom, with other galley slaves, Don Quixote set free in the Sierra Morena: a kindness for which he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from that evil-minded, ill-conditioned set. This Gines de Pasamonte — Don Ginesillo de Parapilla, Don Quixote called him — it was that stole Dapple from Sancho Panza; which, because by the fault of the printers neither the how nor the when was stated in the First Part, has been a puzzle to a good many people, who attribute to the bad memory of the author what was the error of the press. In fact, however, Gines stole him while Sancho Panza was asleep on his back, adopting the plan and device that Brunello had recourse to when he stole Sacripante’s horse from between his legs at the siege of Albracca; and, as has been told, Sancho afterwards recovered him. This Gines, then, afraid of being caught by the officers of justice, who were looking for him to punish him for his numberless rascalities and offences (which were so many and so great that he himself wrote a big book giving an account of them), resolved to shift his quarters into the kingdom of Aragon, and cover up his left eye, and take up the trade of a puppet-showman; for this, as well as juggling, he knew how to practise to perfection. From some released Christians returning from Barbary, it so happened, he bought the ape, which he taught to mount upon his shoulder on his making a certain sign, and to whisper, or seem to do so, in his ear. Thus prepared, before entering any village whither he was bound with his show and his ape, he used to inform himself at the nearest village, or from the most likely person he could find, as to what particular things had happened there, and to whom; and bearing them well in mind, the first thing be did was to exhibit his show, sometimes one story, sometimes another, but all lively, amusing, and familiar. As soon as the exhibition was over he brought forward the accomplishments of his ape, assuring the public that he divined all the past and the present, but as to the future he had no skill. For each question answered he asked two reals, and for some he made a reduction, just as he happened to feel the pulse of the questioners; and when now and then he came to houses where things that he knew of had happened to the people living there, even if they did not ask him a question, not caring to pay for it, he would make the sign to the ape and then declare that it had said so and so, which fitted the case exactly. In this way he acquired a prodigious name and all ran after him; on other occasions, being very crafty, he would answer in such a way that the answers suited the questions; and as no one cross-questioned him or pressed him to tell how his ape divined, he made fools of them all and filled his pouch. The instant he entered the inn he knew Don Quixote and Sancho, and with that knowledge it was easy for him to astonish them and all who were there; but it would have cost him dear had Don Quixote brought down his hand a little lower when he cut off King Marsilio’s head and destroyed all his horsemen, as related in the preceeding chapter.\n So much for Master Pedro and his ape; and now to return to Don Quixote of La Mancha. After he had left the inn he determined to visit, first of all, the banks of the Ebro and that neighbourhood, before entering the city of Saragossa, for the ample time there was still to spare before the jousts left him enough for all. With this object in view he followed the road and travelled along it for two days, without meeting any adventure worth committing to writing until on the third day, as he was ascending a hill, he heard a great noise of drums, trumpets, and musket-shots. At first he imagined some regiment of soldiers was passing that way, and to see them he spurred Rocinante and mounted the hill. On reaching the top he saw at the foot of it over two hundred men, as it seemed to him, armed with weapons of various sorts, lances, crossbows, partisans, halberds, and pikes, and a few muskets and a great many bucklers. He descended the slope and approached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags, make out the colours and distinguish the devices they bore, especially one on a standard or ensign of white satin, on which there was painted in a very life-like style an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its mouth open and its tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of braying; and round it were inscribed in large characters these two lines —\n They did not bray in vain,\n Our alcaldes twain.\n From this device Don Quixote concluded that these people must be from the braying town, and he said so to Sancho, explaining to him what was written on the standard. At the same time be observed that the man who had told them about the matter was wrong in saying that the two who brayed were regidors, for according to the lines of the standard they were alcaldes. To which Sancho replied, “Senor, there’s nothing to stick at in that, for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to he alcaldes of their town afterwards, and so they may go by both titles; moreover, it has nothing to do with the truth of the story whether the brayers were alcaldes or regidors, provided at any rate they did bray; for an alcalde is just as likely to bray as a regidor.” They perceived, in short, clearly that the town which had been twitted had turned out to do battle with some other that had jeered it more than was fair or neighbourly.\n Don Quixote proceeded to join them, not a little to Sancho’s uneasiness, for he never relished mixing himself up in expeditions of that sort. The members of the troop received him into the midst of them, taking him to he some one who was on their side. Don Quixote, putting up his visor, advanced with an easy bearing and demeanour to the standard with the ass, and all the chief men of the army gathered round him to look at him, staring at him with the usual amazement that everybody felt on seeing him for the first time. Don Quixote, seeing them examining him so attentively, and that none of them spoke to him or put any question to him, determined to take advantage of their silence; so, breaking his own, he lifted up his voice and said, “Worthy sirs, I entreat you as earnestly as I can not to interrupt an argument I wish to address to you, until you find it displeases or wearies you; and if that come to pass, on the slightest hint you give me I will put a seal upon my lips and a gag upon my tongue.”\n They all bade him say what he liked, for they would listen to him willingly.\n \n With this permission Don Quixote went on to say, “I, sirs, am a knight-errant whose calling is that of arms, and whose profession is to protect those who require protection, and give help to such as stand in need of it. Some days ago I became acquainted with your misfortune and the cause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revenge yourselves upon your enemies; and having many times thought over your business in my mind, I find that, according to the laws of combat, you are mistaken in holding yourselves insulted; for a private individual cannot insult an entire community; unless it be by defying it collectively as a traitor, because he cannot tell who in particular is guilty of the treason for which he defies it. Of this we have an example in Don Diego Ordonez de Lara, who defied the whole town of Zamora, because he did not know that Vellido Dolfos alone had committed the treachery of slaying his king; and therefore he defied them all, and the vengeance and the reply concerned all; though, to be sure, Senor Don Diego went rather too far, indeed very much beyond the limits of a defiance; for he had no occasion to defy the dead, or the waters, or the fishes, or those yet unborn, and all the rest of it as set forth; but let that pass, for when anger breaks out there’s no father, governor, or bridle to check the tongue. The case being, then, that no one person can insult a kingdom, province, city, state, or entire community, it is clear there is no reason for going out to avenge the defiance of such an insult, inasmuch as it is not one. A fine thing it would be if the people of the clock town were to be at loggerheads every moment with everyone who called them by that name, — or the Cazoleros, Berengeneros, Ballenatos, Jaboneros, or the bearers of all the other names and titles that are always in the mouth of the boys and common people! It would be a nice business indeed if all these illustrious cities were to take huff and revenge themselves and go about perpetually making trombones of their swords in every petty quarrel! No, no; God forbid! There are four things for which sensible men and well-ordered States ought to take up arms, draw their swords, and risk their persons, lives, and properties. The first is to defend the Catholic faith; the second, to defend one’s life, which is in accordance with natural and divine law; the third, in defence of one’s honour, family, and property; the fourth, in the service of one’s king in a just war; and if to these we choose to add a fifth (which may be included in the second), in defence of one’s country. To these five, as it were capital causes, there may be added some others that may be just and reasonable, and make it a duty to take up arms; but to take them up for trifles and things to laugh at and he amused by rather than offended, looks as though he who did so was altogether wanting in common sense. Moreover, to take an unjust revenge (and there cannot be any just one) is directly opposed to the sacred law that we acknowledge, wherein we are commanded to do good to our enemies and to love them that hate us; a command which, though it seems somewhat difficult to obey, is only so to those who have in them less of God than of the world, and more of the flesh than of the spirit; for Jesus Christ, God and true man, who never lied, and could not and cannot lie, said, as our law-giver, that his yoke was easy and his burden light; he would not, therefore, have laid any command upon us that it was impossible to obey. Thus, sirs, you are bound to keep quiet by human and divine law.”\n “The devil take me,” said Sancho to himself at this, “but this master of mine is a tologian; or, if not, faith, he’s as like one as one egg is like another.”\n Don Quixote stopped to take breath, and, observing that silence was still preserved, had a mind to continue his discourse, and would have done so had not Sancho interposed with his smartness; for he, seeing his master pause, took the lead, saying, “My lord Don Quixote of La Mancha, who once was called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, but now is called the Knight of the Lions, is a gentleman of great discretion who knows Latin and his mother tongue like a bachelor, and in everything that he deals with or advises proceeds like a good soldier, and has all the laws and ordinances of what they call combat at his fingers’ ends; so you have nothing to do but to let yourselves be guided by what he says, and on my head be it if it is wrong. Besides which, you have been told that it is folly to take offence at merely hearing a bray. I remember when I was a boy I brayed as often as I had a fancy, without anyone hindering me, and so elegantly and naturally that when I brayed all the asses in the town would bray; but I was none the less for that the son of my parents who were greatly respected; and though I was envied because of the gift by more than one of the high and mighty ones of the town, I did not care two farthings for it; and that you may see I am telling the truth, wait a bit and listen, for this art, like swimming, once learnt is never forgotten;” and then, taking hold of his nose, he began to bray so vigorously that all the valleys around rang again.\n One of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he was mocking them, lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a blow with it that Sancho dropped helpless to the ground. Don Quixote, seeing him so roughly handled, attacked the man who had struck him lance in hand, but so many thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge him. Far from it, finding a shower of stones rained upon him, and crossbows and muskets unnumbered levelled at him, he wheeled Rocinante round and, as fast as his best gallop could take him, fled from the midst of them, commending himself to God with all his heart to deliver him out of this peril, in dread every step of some ball coming in at his back and coming out at his breast, and every minute drawing his breath to see whether it had gone from him. The members of the band, however, were satisfied with seeing him take to flight, and did not fire on him. They put up Sancho, scarcely restored to his senses, on his ass, and let him go after his master; not that he was sufficiently in his wits to guide the beast, but Dapple followed the footsteps of Rocinante, from whom he could not remain a moment separated. Don Quixote having got some way off looked back, and seeing Sancho coming, waited for him, as he perceived that no one followed him. The men of the troop stood their ground till night, and as the enemy did not come out to battle, they returned to their town exulting; and had they been aware of the ancient custom of the Greeks, they would have erected a trophy on the spot.\n \n 解驴叫纠纷，不料事与愿违，自找倒霉\n 这部伟大小说的作者锡德·哈迈德在本章开头写道：“我以一个虔诚的基督教徒的名义发誓……”可是译者说，锡德·哈迈德明明是摩尔人，却要以一个虔诚的基督教徒的名义发誓，这无非是为了表明，既然他以基督教徒的名义发誓，他说的那些事就都是真实的，或者应该是真实的。所以，他写唐吉诃德的那些事，特别是介绍佩德罗师傅为何许人，那只猴子在那一带村镇以占卦称奇等等，也都是真的了。作者又说，读者也许还记得，在本书的上卷里，唐吉诃德在莫雷纳山释放的那批苦役犯里有个叫希内斯·德帕萨蒙特的，唐吉诃德称之为希内西略·德帕拉皮利亚，后来就是他偷了桑乔的驴。可是由于印刷者的失误，小说的上卷里忘了说明驴是如何被偷以及何时被偷的，所以很多人把印刷者的责任归咎于作者的疏忽。其实，希内斯是趁桑乔在驴背上打瞌睡的时候把驴偷走的，就像当初萨克里潘特骑在阿尔布拉卡上时，布鲁内略竟从他的腿下把马偷走了一样。后来桑乔把驴找回来了，这在前面已经有所记述。这个希内斯自知罪孽深重，罄竹难书，为了逃避法律的惩罚，决定逃到阿拉贡境内，蒙上左眼，靠演木偶戏过日子。演木偶戏这类事可是他的拿手本领。\n 后来，他从几个获得自由后从土耳其的柏培尔回来的基督徒手里买了那只猴子，训练它一看到自己的信号就跳到自己肩上，在耳边嘀嘀咕咕，或者像是嘀嘀咕咕。后来，他带着他的戏班子和猴子去某地演出之前，总是先在附近尽可能了解有哪些人，哪些事情，把这些记在脑子里。到了那个地方之后，他首先演出木偶戏。木偶戏有些是历史题材的，有些属于其他内容，但都是大家熟悉的有趣剧目。演完木偶戏后，他就开始显示猴子的本领，向当地人说猴子可以算出过去和现在的事情，只是不能预测将来的事情。每回答一个问题收两个雷阿尔，有时候也视问话人的情况酌情减价。他甚至还会到他知道曾出过什么事的家庭去，即使人家不愿意花钱占卦，他也向猴子发出信号，然后说猴子告诉他什么事情，结果当然很符合实际情况。他就这样赢得了大家的信任，人们都很崇拜他。他这个人很机灵，往往能把问题回答得恰如其分。由于从来没人追问过他的猴子是如何占卦的，所以他到处招摇撞骗而饱了私囊。那次，他一进客店就认出了唐吉诃德和桑乔。他很了解他们两人的情况，因此占起卦来很容易让唐吉诃德、桑乔和客店里的所有人感到惊奇。不过，正像前面一章所记述的那样，唐吉诃德挥剑斩掉了马尔西利奥国王的脑袋，并且扫荡了他的骑兵团。如果当时唐吉诃德的手再低一点儿，希内斯付出的代价可就大了。这就是有关佩德罗师傅及其猴子的情况。\n 再说曼查的唐吉诃德离开客店之后，决定先到埃布罗河沿岸地带，然后再进入萨拉戈萨城。在进行擂台比武之前，他还有的是时间四处周游。他怀着这个目的赶路，走了两天，没遇到什么值得记录在纸上的事情。第三天，唐吉诃德登上一个山区，忽然听到一阵鼓号声和火枪的枪声。\n 起初唐吉诃德还以为是某支军队从那儿经过。为了看得更清楚些，他催马往山顶赶去，到了山顶才发现是两百多名武装分子，带着各种武器，长矛呀、弩呀、戟呀、扎枪呀，还有一些火枪和护胸盾牌。唐吉诃德沿着山坡往下走，已经接近了那群人，可以清楚地看到他们的旗帜，而且可以看清旗子的颜色和旗帜上的徽记，特别是能看清其中一面白缎尖角旗上画着一头小驴。那头驴画得十分逼真，它昂着头，张着嘴，舌头伸出，那姿态仿佛在嘶叫。它的周围用大字写着两行字：\n 两位大市长\n 驴叫没白学\n 唐吉诃德根据这面旗子断定准是那个驴叫镇的人。于是他告诉了桑乔那旗子上写的是什么，还说，告诉他们这件事的人一定是弄错了，因为原来说学驴叫的是两位议员，可是按照旗子上写的，学驴叫的却是两位市长。桑乔答道：\n “大人，这倒无关紧要，说不定当时学驴叫的两位议员后来成了市长呢。如果是这样，用这两种称呼都可以。况且，不管是市长学还是议员学，只要他们学过驴叫就行了。无论是市长还是议员，都可以学驴叫。”\n 最后，唐吉诃德和桑乔明白了，原来是受羞辱的那个镇子的人出来同羞辱他们的那个镇子的人打架。那个镇子的人闹得实在太不像话，他们已经无法再和睦相处了。\n 唐吉诃德向那些人走去。桑乔见了不无担心，他向来不愿意让唐吉诃德参与这种事情。那群人以为唐吉诃德是跟他们一伙的，就放他进了队伍。唐吉诃德掀起护眼罩，风度翩翩地来到驴旗下。那伙人当中的几个领头人都围过来看他，而且同所有初次见到他的人一样，感到十分惊奇。唐吉诃德见大家都盯着他，没有一个人说话，就趁别人还没开口，提高嗓门说道：\n “各位大人好，我想对诸位说几句话。我恳求你们让我把话讲完。如果有什么地方冒犯了你们，只要你们稍微有所表示，我就会往我的嘴上贴个封条，把舌头缩回去。”\n 大家都说有话请讲，愿意洗耳恭听。这样，唐吉诃德才继续说道：\n “诸位大人，我是个游侠骑士。游侠骑士是个习武行当，他的职责是扶弱济贫。我前几天听说了你们遭遇的不幸，也知道了你们不时同你们的对手发生冲突的原因。关于你们的事情，我已经考虑很久了。按照决斗的规则，如果你们认为自己受了侮辱，那就错了。因为一个人不能侮辱全镇的人，除非他不知道是谁背叛了自己，才把对方的人都一起算上。要说这种例子，只有唐迭戈·奥多涅斯·德拉腊。他不知道只是贝利多·多尔福斯背叛并杀害了国王，所以才侮辱整个萨莫拉的居民，于是全城人都要报仇，都起来反击。当然，唐迭戈大人做得确实有些过分，他所做的已经大大超出了他应该指责的范围。他没有理由侮辱死者，侮辱水，侮辱面包，侮辱那些即将出生的人和其他一些毫不相干的东西。可是愤怒一旦爆发，便一发而不可止，难以遏制。但即使这样，个人也不该侮辱整个王国、省、城市、村镇和全体人民。对于这种侮辱，显然也没有必要去报复，因为这还称不上是侮辱。那些年轻人和粗人总爱起外号，如果‘母钟镇’①的人总是去和如此称呼他们的人厮杀，还有‘管家男’、‘茄子秧’、‘小鲸鱼’、‘大肥皂’等地②的人也都去拼命，那还得了！如果这些人为了一点儿小事就去争斗，打来打去的，那还得了！那可不行！连上帝也不会答应！明智的男人和治理有方的国家只有在四种情况下才会弹上膛，剑出鞘，不惜牺牲个人的生命和财产。这四种情况就是：第一，保卫自己的天主教信仰；第二，保护自己的生命，这是顺理成章的法则；第三，保护自己的名誉、家庭和财产；第四，在正义战争中为国王效劳。如果可以再加个第五条，或者说附加一条，那就是保卫祖国。除了这五条至关重要的原因之外，还有其他一些正当合理的情况，也可以拿起武器。可是为一些枝节小事，为一些与其说是侮辱还不如说是开玩笑的小事舞刀弄枪，就显得有些欠考虑了。况且，进行这些并非正义的报复直接违反了我们所信仰的神圣法则。当然，如果是正义行动，那就谈不上是报复了。神圣法则要我们友好对待我们的敌人，热爱讨厌我们的人。这点虽然有点儿难以做到，但这是那些只注重人世而不尊重上帝、只注重肉体而忽略了精神的人所必须遵守的。耶稣基督是上帝，也是实实在在的人。他从不说谎，过去和现在都不说谎。作为我们的创世者，他说：‘我的轭是软和的，我的担子是轻的。’他并没有要求我们做任何办不到的事。所以诸位大人，你们有义务遵照人类的神圣法则平静下来。”“我的主人简直是神学家，”桑乔这时说，“否则真是活见鬼啦。就算他不是，也同神学家没什么区别。”\n ①因为该地区肥皂消费量很大。\n ②“管家男”指巴利阿多里德人，“茄子秧”指托莱多人，“水鲸鱼”指马德里人。这几个绰号都曾在当时的滑稽戏里使用。“大肥皂”指塞维利亚人，指塞维利亚的埃斯帕蒂纳镇。当地教堂需配置一个大钟，于是要求塞维利亚省为他们装一个“母钟”，以便以后生出小钟来。\n 唐吉诃德停下来喘口气。他见大家仍然盯着他不做声，就想继续说下去，似乎并没有察觉桑乔的尖刻言辞。桑乔见唐吉诃德停住了，立刻把话头接过来，说道：\n “我的主人曼查的唐吉诃德，曾经叫‘猥獕骑士’，现在叫‘狮子骑士’，是一位非常聪明的贵族，精通拉丁文和卡斯蒂利亚语；他无论劝导什么事都是一把好手；对于各种决斗规则，他了如指掌。所以他说什么，你们尽管照办就行了，错了算我的。而且，他刚才说了，没有必要仅仅因为别人学驴叫就发火，我对此也同意。我年轻的时候，想怎么学就怎么学，没有人管我们，而且我学得惟妙惟肖。只要我一叫，全村所有的驴都跟着叫。不过尽管如此，我还是我爹妈的儿子，我爹妈都是很正派的人哩！我这点本领受到我们村几个人的嫉妒，不过我满不在乎。我说的都是真话，不信你们等等，听我叫一下。这种本领就跟游泳一样，一旦学会了，一辈子也忘不了。”\n 说完桑乔就用手捏着鼻子，开始学起驴叫来。他的叫声非常响亮，使附近所有的山谷都回荡不已。桑乔身旁的一个人以为桑乔是在嘲笑他们，便举起手里的棍子朝桑乔打去，打得桑乔支持不住，倒在地上。\n 唐吉诃德见桑乔遭打，便提起长矛向打桑乔的那个人冲去，可是两人之间隔着许多人，根本够不着那个人。相反，他见石头像雨点儿似的打来，还有许许多多弩和火枪对着他，只好掉转罗西南多，拼命地逃跑，一边跑还一边祈求上帝保佑他脱离危险，唯恐一颗子弹从背后打进，再从前胸穿出来。此外，他还得不时地喘息一下，以便看看自己是否还有气。不过，那些人见唐吉诃德已经逃跑，也就不再扔石头了。他们把桑乔抬到驴上，让他骑着驴随主人而去，当时桑乔刚刚醒过来，还不足以驾驭自己的驴。好在那头驴始终跟着罗西南多，寸步不离。唐吉诃德跑出一段路，回头见没有人追赶，便停下来等桑乔。\n 那伙人一直在原地等到天黑，没见对手前来应战，便高高兴兴地回自己的镇子了。如果他们知道古希腊人的习惯，肯定会在那个地方建立一座胜利纪念碑。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4648.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
