{"id":42247,"no":107,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 53","content":"To fancy that in this life anything belonging to it will remain for ever in the same state is an idle fancy; on the contrary, in it everything seems to go in a circle, I mean round and round. The spring succeeds the summer, the summer the fall, the fall the autumn, the autumn the winter, and the winter the spring, and so time rolls with never-ceasing wheel. Man’s life alone, swifter than time, speeds onward to its end without any hope of renewal, save it be in that other life which is endless and boundless. Thus saith Cide Hamete the Mahometan philosopher; for there are many that by the light of nature alone, without the light of faith, have a comprehension of the fleeting nature and instability of this present life and the endless duration of that eternal life we hope for; but our author is here speaking of the rapidity with which Sancho’s government came to an end, melted away, disappeared, vanished as it were in smoke and shadow. For as he lay in bed on the night of the seventh day of his government, sated, not with bread and wine, but with delivering judgments and giving opinions and making laws and proclamations, just as sleep, in spite of hunger, was beginning to close his eyelids, he heard such a noise of bell-ringing and shouting that one would have fancied the whole island was going to the bottom. He sat up in bed and remained listening intently to try if he could make out what could be the cause of so great an uproar; not only, however, was he unable to discover what it was, but as countless drums and trumpets now helped to swell the din of the bells and shouts, he was more puzzled than ever, and filled with fear and terror; and getting up he put on a pair of slippers because of the dampness of the floor, and without throwing a dressing gown or anything of the kind over him he rushed out of the door of his room, just in time to see approaching along a corridor a band of more than twenty persons with lighted torches and naked swords in their hands, all shouting out, “To arms, to arms, senor governor, to arms! The enemy is in the island in countless numbers, and we are lost unless your skill and valour come to our support.” Keeping up this noise, tumult, and uproar, they came to where Sancho stood dazed and bewildered by what he saw and heard, and as they approached one of them called out to him, “Arm at once, your lordship, if you would not have yourself destroyed and the whole island lost.” “What have I to do with arming?” said Sancho. “What do I know about arms or supports? Better leave all that to my master Don Quixote, who will settle it and make all safe in a trice; for I, sinner that I am, God help me, don’t understand these scuffles.” “Ah, senor governor,” said another, “what slackness of mettle this is! Arm yourself; here are arms for you, offensive and defensive; come out to the plaza and be our leader and captain; it falls upon you by right, for you are our governor.” “Arm me then, in God’s name,” said Sancho, and they at once produced two large shields they had come provided with, and placed them upon him over his shirt, without letting him put on anything else, one shield in front and the other behind, and passing his arms through openings they had made, they bound him tight with ropes, so that there he was walled and boarded up as straight as a spindle and unable to bend his knees or stir a single step. In his hand they placed a lance, on which he leant to keep himself from falling, and as soon as they had him thus fixed they bade him march forward and lead them on and give them all courage; for with him for their guide and lamp and morning star, they were sure to bring their business to a successful issue. “How am I to march, unlucky being that I am?” said Sancho, “when I can’t stir my knee-caps, for these boards I have bound so tight to my body won’t let me. What you must do is carry me in your arms, and lay me across or set me upright in some postern, and I’ll hold it either with this lance or with my body.” “On, senor governor!” cried another, “it is fear more than the boards that keeps you from moving; make haste, stir yourself, for there is no time to lose; the enemy is increasing in numbers, the shouts grow louder, and the danger is pressing.” Urged by these exhortations and reproaches the poor governor made an attempt to advance, but fell to the ground with such a crash that he fancied he had broken himself all to pieces. There he lay like a tortoise enclosed in its shell, or a side of bacon between two kneading-troughs, or a boat bottom up on the beach; nor did the gang of jokers feel any compassion for him when they saw him down; so far from that, extinguishing their torches they began to shout afresh and to renew the calls to arms with such energy, trampling on poor Sancho, and slashing at him over the shield with their swords in such a way that, if he had not gathered himself together and made himself small and drawn in his head between the shields, it would have fared badly with the poor governor, as, squeezed into that narrow compass, he lay, sweating and sweating again, and commending himself with all his heart to God to deliver him from his present peril. Some stumbled over him, others fell upon him, and one there was who took up a position on top of him for some time, and from thence as if from a watchtower issued orders to the troops, shouting out, “Here, our side! Here the enemy is thickest! Hold the breach there! Shut that gate! Barricade those ladders! Here with your stink-pots of pitch and resin, and kettles of boiling oil! Block the streets with feather beds!” In short, in his ardour he mentioned every little thing, and every implement and engine of war by means of which an assault upon a city is warded off, while the bruised and battered Sancho, who heard and suffered all, was saying to himself, “O if it would only please the Lord to let the island be lost at once, and I could see myself either dead or out of this torture!” Heaven heard his prayer, and when he least expected it he heard voices exclaiming, “Victory, victory! The enemy retreats beaten! Come, senor governor, get up, and come and enjoy the victory, and divide the spoils that have been won from the foe by the might of that invincible arm.” “Lift me up,” said the wretched Sancho in a woebegone voice. They helped him to rise, and as soon as he was on his feet said, “The enemy I have beaten you may nail to my forehead; I don’t want to divide the spoils of the foe, I only beg and entreat some friend, if I have one, to give me a sup of wine, for I’m parched with thirst, and wipe me dry, for I’m turning to water.” They rubbed him down, fetched him wine and unbound the shields, and he seated himself upon his bed, and with fear, agitation, and fatigue he fainted away. Those who had been concerned in the joke were now sorry they had pushed it so far; however, the anxiety his fainting away had caused them was relieved by his returning to himself. He asked what o’clock it was; they told him it was just daybreak. He said no more, and in silence began to dress himself, while all watched him, waiting to see what the haste with which he was putting on his clothes meant. He got himself dressed at last, and then, slowly, for he was sorely bruised and could not go fast, he proceeded to the stable, followed by all who were present, and going up to Dapple embraced him and gave him a loving kiss on the forehead, and said to him, not without tears in his eyes, “Come along, comrade and friend and partner of my toils and sorrows; when I was with you and had no cares to trouble me except mending your harness and feeding your little carcass, happy were my hours, my days, and my years; but since I left you, and mounted the towers of ambition and pride, a thousand miseries, a thousand troubles, and four thousand anxieties have entered into my soul;” and all the while he was speaking in this strain he was fixing the pack-saddle on the ass, without a word from anyone. Then having Dapple saddled, he, with great pain and difficulty, got up on him, and addressing himself to the majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, and Pedro Recio the doctor and several others who stood by, he said, “Make way, gentlemen, and let me go back to my old freedom; let me go look for my past life, and raise myself up from this present death. I was not born to be a governor or protect islands or cities from the enemies that choose to attack them. Ploughing and digging, vinedressing and pruning, are more in my way than defending provinces or kingdoms. ‘Saint Peter is very well at Rome; I mean each of us is best following the trade he was born to. A reaping-hook fits my hand better than a governor’s sceptre; I’d rather have my fill of gazpacho’ than be subject to the misery of a meddling doctor who me with hunger, and I’d rather lie in summer under the shade of an oak, and in winter wrap myself in a double sheepskin jacket in freedom, than go to bed between holland sheets and dress in sables under the restraint of a government. God be with your worships, and tell my lord the duke that ‘naked I was born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor gain;’ I mean that without a farthing I came into this government, and without a farthing I go out of it, very different from the way governors commonly leave other islands. Stand aside and let me go; I have to plaster myself, for I believe every one of my ribs is crushed, thanks to the enemies that have been trampling over me to-night.” “That is unnecessary, senor governor,” said Doctor Recio, “for I will give your worship a draught against falls and bruises that will soon make you as sound and strong as ever; and as for your diet I promise your worship to behave better, and let you eat plentifully of whatever you like.” “You spoke late,” said Sancho. “I’d as soon turn Turk as stay any longer. Those jokes won’t pass a second time. By God I’d as soon remain in this government, or take another, even if it was offered me between two plates, as fly to heaven without wings. I am of the breed of the Panzas, and they are every one of them obstinate, and if they once say ‘odds,’ odds it must be, no matter if it is evens, in spite of all the world. Here in this stable I leave the ant’s wings that lifted me up into the air for the swifts and other birds to eat me, and let’s take to level ground and our feet once more; and if they’re not shod in pinked shoes of cordovan, they won’t want for rough sandals of hemp; ‘every ewe to her like,’ ‘and let no one stretch his leg beyond the length of the sheet;’ and now let me pass, for it’s growing late with me.” To this the majordomo said, “Senor governor, we would let your worship go with all our hearts, though it sorely grieves us to lose you, for your wit and Christian conduct naturally make us regret you; but it is well known that every governor, before he leaves the place where he has been governing, is bound first of all to render an account. Let your worship do so for the ten days you have held the government, and then you may go and the peace of God go with you.” “No one can demand it of me,” said Sancho, “but he whom my lord the duke shall appoint; I am going to meet him, and to him I will render an exact one; besides, when I go forth naked as I do, there is no other proof needed to show that I have governed like an angel.” “By God the great Sancho is right,” said Doctor Recio, “and we should let him go, for the duke will be beyond measure glad to see him.” They all agreed to this, and allowed him to go, first offering to bear him company and furnish him with all he wanted for his own comfort or for the journey. Sancho said he did not want anything more than a little barley for Dapple, and half a cheese and half a loaf for himself; for the distance being so short there was no occasion for any better or bulkier provant. They all embraced him, and he with tears embraced all of them, and left them filled with admiration not only at his remarks but at his firm and sensible resolution. “若想让生活中的事物永远保持永恒不变的状态，那只能是一种妄想。相反，人们应该想到一切都是循环往复的：春去夏来，夏过秋至，秋往冬到，冬逝春临，时间就是如此循环不已的。只有人的生命有其尽头，而且赛过日月穿梭，除非在天国英灵长存，否则永远不得复生。”这是伊斯兰哲学家锡德·哈迈德的话，让人懂得了人生如梦，永存只是一种企盼。人们不必靠信仰指点，只靠自己天生的感应就能领悟到这一点。我们作者的这段话只是想说明桑乔当总督不过是过眼烟云，转瞬即逝。 这是桑乔当总督的第七天晚上。他在床上躺着，不仅因为面包没饱酒未足，而且因为忙于批文审卷，制定法规法令，所以困意袭来，虽然饥肠辘辘，眼皮还是慢慢地合上了。这时，忽然响起了巨大的钟声和喊声，似乎整个岛屿都要沉陷下去了。桑乔从床上坐起来，仔细倾听着，想辨明究竟发生了什么事，外面竟这样乱哄哄的。可是他不仅没把骚乱的原因搞清楚，反而听到除了喊声和钟声之外，还增加了号角声和鼓声。于是桑乔更加慌乱了，恐惧万分。他赶紧下地。地上潮，他穿上拖鞋，来不及披上外衣，就跑出门外，恰巧看见二十多个人手里拿着火炬和剑跑过来，边跑边大声喊道： “拿起武器，赶快拿起武器，总督大人！已经有无数敌人上了咱们的岛，如果您不用您的智慧和勇气拯救我们，我们就完了！” 桑乔面对这些喊声和狂乱感到惊慌失措，目瞪口呆。这时，有人跑到他身边对他说： “大人，如果您不想完蛋，不想让这座岛完蛋，就赶紧拿起武器！” “我有什么武器呀，我又能帮你们干什么呢？”桑乔说，“这种事情最好让我的主人唐吉诃德去做，他三下五除二就可以完事大吉。我这个上帝的罪人，对这些事情一窍不通呀。” “哎呀，总督大人，”另一个人说，“您怎么这么窝囊呀！我们给您带来了进攻和防御的武器，您赶紧拿起武器。带领我们杀敌吧。您是我们的总督，这是您的份内之事。” “那就给我武器吧。”桑乔说。 于是，有人立刻给他拿来两个大盾牌①，一前一后地扣在他的衬衣上，来不及让他再套一件外衣，就从盾牌的凹处把桑乔的胳膊掏出来，用绳子把盾牌牢牢地捆在桑乔身上，弄得桑乔像根木头似的直直地站在那儿，既不能弯腿，也不能挪步。有人往桑乔手里塞了一根长矛，让他当拐棍撑着，以免跌倒。弄好以后，大家让桑乔在前面带路，给大家鼓劲，说他是北极星、指路灯、启明星，有了他一定会取得最后的成功。 ①一种可以遮挡全身的长盾牌。 “可是，”桑乔说，“我觉得真别扭，两块盾牌捆在我身上，膝盖动弹不得，我怎么走得了路呢？你们把我抬着或者架着弄到道口去，让我用我的长矛或者我的身体守住道口吧。” “行了，总督，”另一个人说，“是恐惧而不是盾牌让您迈不开步子。您快点挪步吧，否则就晚了。敌人越来越多，喊声越来越大，危险也更大了。” 大家连劝带骂，可怜的总督只好试着挪动步子，结果一下子重重地摔倒在地上，他还以为自己摔成了几块呢。桑乔趴在地上，就像一只缩在龟壳里的乌龟，像半扇夹在木槽中的腌猪肉，或者像一只扣在沙滩上的小船。那些拿桑乔开心的人并没有因为看到他倒在地上而生出一点儿怜悯之心，相反却熄灭了火把，又重新提高了嗓门，不断喊着“拿起武器”，在他身上快速地跑来跑去，而且用剑向他身上的盾牌不断地刺。若是桑乔没有把头缩在两个盾牌之间，他可就遭了大殃了。桑乔蜷缩在两块盾牌之间，大汗淋漓，一心只求上帝保佑他脱险。有的人被桑乔绊倒，有的人摔倒在他身上，还有人竟在他身上站了半天，拿他的身体当瞭望台，一边指挥着队伍一边大声喊道： “现在全看我们了，让敌人都往这儿来吧！守住那个缺口！关上那座大门！截断那个楼梯！赶紧上燃烧罐！把松脂放到油锅里去煮！用垫子把那几条通道堵住！” 那个人把守城时能够用得着的术语和武器弹药都起劲地数了一遍，被压在下面的桑乔浑身疼痛，心里说道：“哎哟，但愿上帝保佑，让这个岛赶紧失守吧，让我赶紧死掉或者赶紧摆脱这场苦难吧！”老天听到了他的请求，桑乔出乎意料地听见人们在喊： “胜利了！胜利了！敌人被打败了！噢，总督大人，您赶紧起来，享受胜利的欢乐吧。靠您战无不胜的勇气，我们从敌人那儿得到了不少战利品，您把这些战利品给大家分了吧！” “你们把我扶起来。”浑身疼痛的桑乔痛苦地说道。 大家把他扶了起来，桑乔站好后说道： “我可不相信我打死了某个敌人，我也不想去分配从敌人那里夺来的战利品。如果有谁还同我是朋友，就请这位朋友给我一口葡萄酒吧，我快要渴死了，再帮我擦擦汗吧，我浑身都湿透了。” 大家给桑乔擦了擦汗，给他拿来葡萄酒，又把他身上的盾牌解了下来。桑乔连惊带吓，坐在盾牌上竟昏了过去。于是大家都为恶作剧搞得太过火而发慌了。不过，桑乔马上又苏醒过来，大家这才放了心。桑乔问现在是什么时候，大家说是凌晨。桑乔一声不响地开始穿衣服。大家也都默不作声地看他穿衣服，看他这么早穿上衣服到底要干什么。桑乔穿好了衣服，慢慢地走向马厩。他浑身疼痛，根本走不快。大家都跟在他后面，只见他走到他的驴前，亲热地吻了一下驴的额头，噙着眼泪对驴说道： “来吧，我的伙计，我的朋友，与我同苦共难的伙伴，我同你在一起的时候，只想着别忘了给你修补你的鞍具，喂饱你的肚子。对于我来说，那些时光、那些年月都是幸福的。可是自从我离开了你，爬上了野心和狂妄的高塔之后，心中却增加了数不尽的苦恼和不安。” 桑乔一边说一边给他的驴套上驮鞍，旁边的人都一言不发。套好驮鞍后，桑乔十分伤心地骑了上去，嘴里对管家、文书、餐厅侍者、佩德罗·雷西奥大夫和其他人嘟哝着。他说道： “请让开路吧，诸位大人，让我回到往日自由自在的生活里去吧，让我去寻找往日那种生活，使我从现在这种死亡中复生吧。我生来就不是当总督的料，敌人向我们进攻的时候，我却不能带着大家保卫岛屿和城市。我更善于耕田锄地，修剪葡萄枝，压葡萄蔓，而不是颁布命令，也不懂得保卫辖区或王国的事。‘维持现状，再好不过’，我是说每个人生来就注定了干什么。我一把镰刀在手，胜过握着总督的权杖；我宁愿饱饱地喝一顿冷汤，也不愿忍受一个劣等医生的折磨，那样非把我饿死不可；我宁愿夏日躺在圣栎树的树荫下，冬天穿着只有几根毛的羊皮袄，逍遥自在地生活，也不愿床上铺着白亚麻细布，身上穿着紫貂皮大衣当总督。再见吧，诸位大人，请告诉公爵大人，我来去赤条条，不多也不少，我的意思是说，我来当总督的时候身无分文，离开总督职务时也两袖清风，与其他岛屿总督离任时的情况完全相反。请你们靠边点儿，让我过去，我要去上点儿膏药。我觉得肋骨疼得厉害，这全是敌人晚上在我身上踩的。” “您不必这样，总督大人。”雷西奥大夫说，“我给您一点治摔伤的汤药，您喝了以后很快就会精力充沛如初。至于吃的，我向您保证一定改正，让您想吃什么就痛痛快快吃个够。” “晚矣！”桑乔说，“想让我留下来，那是不可能的事。这种捉弄已经不是一两回了。我向上帝发誓，当总督的事情仅此一回，以后就是再大张旗鼓地请我，也休想叫我当总督了。我们潘萨家族的人都很固执，说不行就是不行，怎么说也不行。让蚂蚁的翅膀留在马厩里吧，就是这副翅膀，把我带到了天空，想让燕子或其他鸟儿把我吃掉。还是让我回到陆地上踏踏实实地走路吧。即使这双脚没有网眼羊皮鞋①，至少我不缺草鞋穿。物以类聚，人以群分，谁也别想跑出自己那个圈儿去。还是让我过去吧，已经晚了。” ①这种鞋曾一度在贵族中流行。 管家说道：“总督大人，尽管我们非常惋惜，但我们还是会痛痛快快地放您过去。您机智灵敏，品行端正，我们也愿意放您走。可是大家都知道，每个总督在离任之前都有责任谈谈自己这段时间的工作情况。那么，您就谈谈您当这十天总督的情况，然后您爱到哪儿就到哪儿去吧。” “除了公爵大人，谁也不能要求我做什么。”桑乔说，“待我见到公爵大人，我会向他如实禀告的。况且，我走时两袖清风，这就足以说明我这个总督当得多好了。” “我向上帝发誓，”雷西奥大夫说，“桑乔说得很对。我觉得咱们现在可以让他走了，公爵大人现在也一定很想见到他。” 大家都同意让桑乔走，而且愿意送他一段路，再送他一些礼物和路上需要的东西。桑乔说他只需要一点儿喂驴的大麦和他自己吃的半个面包。路并不远，所以没必要多带，也最好别带那么多东西。大家拥抱了桑乔，桑乔含泪拥抱了大家，然后离去。大家对桑乔那番议论和他果断而又明智的决定表示钦佩。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4674.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
