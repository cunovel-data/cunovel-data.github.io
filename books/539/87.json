{"id":42227,"no":87,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 33","content":"The history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but in order to keep his word came, before he had well done dinner, to visit the duchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him, made him sit down beside her on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure good breeding, wanted not to sit down; the duchess, however, told him he was to sit down as governor and talk as squire, as in both respects he was worthy of even the chair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador. Sancho shrugged his shoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess’s damsels and duennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he would say. It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying:\n “Now that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, I should be glad if the senor governor would relieve me of certain doubts I have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is now in print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote’s letter to her, for it was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did he dare to invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat, the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the prejudice of the peerless Dulcinea’s good name, a thing that is not at all becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?”\n \n At these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his chair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on his lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he came back to his seat and said, “Now, senora, that I have seen that there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I will answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or dread. And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my own part I hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he says things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody’s that listens to him, are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself could not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond all question, it’s my firm belief he is cracked. Well, then, as this is clear to my mind, I can venture to make him believe things that have neither head nor tail, like that affair of the answer to the letter, and that other of six or eight days ago, which is not yet in history, that is to say, the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for I made him believe she is enchanted, though there’s no more truth in it than over the hills of Ubeda.\n The duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception, so Sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his hearers were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess said, “In consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt starts up in my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says, ‘If Don Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his squire knows it, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goes trusting to his empty promises, there can be no doubt he must be still madder and sillier than his master; and that being so, it will be cast in your teeth, senora duchess, if you give the said Sancho an island to govern; for how will he who does not know how to govern himself know how to govern others?’”\n “By God, senora,” said Sancho, “but that doubt comes timely; but your grace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like; for I know what you say is true, and if I were wise I should have left my master long ago; but this was my fate, this was my bad luck; I can’t help it, I must follow him; we’re from the same village, I’ve eaten his bread, I’m fond of him, I’m grateful, he gave me his ass-colts, and above all I’m faithful; so it’s quite impossible for anything to separate us, except the pickaxe and shovel. And if your highness does not like to give me the government you promised, God made me without it, and maybe your not giving it to me will be all the better for my conscience, for fool as I am I know the proverb ‘to her hurt the ant got wings,’ and it may be that Sancho the squire will get to heaven sooner than Sancho the governor. ‘They make as good bread here as in France,’ and ‘by night all cats are grey,’ and ‘a hard case enough his, who hasn’t broken his fast at two in the afternoon,’ and ‘there’s no stomach a hand’s breadth bigger than another,’ and the same can he filled ‘with straw or hay,’ as the saying is, and ‘the little birds of the field have God for their purveyor and caterer,’ and ‘four yards of Cuenca frieze keep one warmer than four of Segovia broad-cloth,’ and ‘when we quit this world and are put underground the prince travels by as narrow a path as the journeyman,’ and ‘the Pope’s body does not take up more feet of earth than the sacristan’s ,’ for all that the one is higher than the other; for when we go to our graves we all pack ourselves up and make ourselves small, or rather they pack us up and make us small in spite of us, and then — good night to us. And I say once more, if your ladyship does not like to give me the island because I’m a fool, like a wise man I will take care to give myself no trouble about it; I have heard say that ‘behind the cross there’s the devil,’ and that ‘all that glitters is not gold,’ and that from among the oxen, and the ploughs, and the yokes, Wamba the husbandman was taken to be made King of Spain, and from among brocades, and pleasures, and riches, Roderick was taken to be devoured by adders, if the verses of the old ballads don’t lie.”\n “To be sure they don’t lie!” exclaimed Dona Rodriguez, the duenna, who was one of the listeners. “Why, there’s a ballad that says they put King Rodrigo alive into a tomb full of toads, and adders, and lizards, and that two days afterwards the king, in a plaintive, feeble voice, cried out from within the tomb —\n They gnaw me now, they gnaw me now, There where I most did sin.\n And according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he would rather be a labouring man than a king, if vermin are to eat him.”\n The duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her duenna, or wondering at the language and proverbs of Sancho, to whom she said, “Worthy Sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made a promise he strives to keep it, though it should cost him his life. My lord and husband the duke, though not one of the errant sort, is none the less a knight for that reason, and will keep his word about the promised island, in spite of the envy and malice of the world. Let Sancho he of good cheer; for when he least expects it he will find himself seated on the throne of his island and seat of dignity, and will take possession of his government that he may discard it for another of three-bordered brocade. The charge I give him is to be careful how he governs his vassals, bearing in mind that they are all loyal and well-born.”\n “As to governing them well,” said Sancho, “there’s no need of charging me to do that, for I’m kind-hearted by nature, and full of compassion for the poor; there’s no stealing the loaf from him who kneads and bakes;’ and by my faith it won’t do to throw false dice with me; I am an old dog, and I know all about ‘tus, tus;’ I can be wide-awake if need be, and I don’t let clouds come before my eyes, for I know where the shoe pinches me; I say so, because with me the good will have support and protection, and the bad neither footing nor access. And it seems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I’ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour I have been brought up to.”\n “You are right, Sancho,” said the duchess, “for no one is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho’s idea of practising a deception upon his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw. Senor Sancho Panza must know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, and then Sancho will he disabused of the error he is under at present.”\n “All that’s very possible,” said Sancho Panza; “and now I’m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to please myself. It must be all exactly the other way, as your ladyship says; because it is impossible to suppose that out of my poor wit such a cunning trick could be concocted in a moment, nor do I think my master is so mad that by my weak and feeble persuasion he could be made to believe a thing so out of all reason. But, senora, your excellence must not therefore think me ill-disposed, for a dolt like me is not bound to see into the thoughts and plots of those vile enchanters. I invented all that to escape my master’s scolding, and not with any intention of hurting him; and if it has turned out differently, there is a God in heaven who judges our hearts.”\n “That is true,” said the duchess; “but tell me, Sancho, what is this you say about the cave of Montesinos, for I should like to know.”\n Sancho upon this related to her, word for word, what has been said already touching that adventure, and having heard it the duchess said, “From this occurrence it may be inferred that, as the great Don Quixote says he saw there the same country wench Sancho saw on the way from El Toboso, it is, no doubt, Dulcinea, and that there are some very active and exceedingly busy enchanters about.”\n “So I say,” said Sancho, “and if my lady Dulcinea is enchanted, so much the worse for her, and I’m not going to pick a quarrel with my master’s enemies, who seem to be many and spiteful. The truth is that the one I saw was a country wench, and I set her down to be a country wench; and if that was Dulcinea it must not be laid at my door, nor should I be called to answer for it or take the consequences. But they must go nagging at me at every step — ‘Sancho said it, Sancho did it, Sancho here, Sancho there,’ as if Sancho was nobody at all, and not that same Sancho Panza that’s now going all over the world in books, so Samson Carrasco told me, and he’s at any rate one that’s a bachelor of Salamanca; and people of that sort can’t lie, except when the whim seizes them or they have some very good reason for it. So there’s no occasion for anybody to quarrel with me; and then I have a good character, and, as I have heard my master say, ‘a good name is better than great riches;’ let them only stick me into this government and they’ll see wonders, for one who has been a good squire will be a good governor.”\n “All worthy Sancho’s observations,” said the duchess, “are Catonian sentences, or at any rate out of the very heart of Michael Verino himself, who florentibus occidit annis. In fact, to speak in his own style, ‘under a bad cloak there’s often a good drinker.’”\n “Indeed, senora,” said Sancho, “I never yet drank out of wickedness; from thirst I have very likely, for I have nothing of the hypocrite in me; I drink when I’m inclined, or, if I’m not inclined, when they offer it to me, so as not to look either strait-laced or ill-bred; for when a friend drinks one’s health what heart can be so hard as not to return it? But if I put on my shoes I don’t dirty them; besides, squires to knights-errant mostly drink water, for they are always wandering among woods, forests and meadows, mountains and crags, without a drop of wine to be had if they gave their eyes for it.”\n “So I believe,” said the duchess; “and now let Sancho go and take his sleep, and we will talk by-and-by at greater length, and settle how he may soon go and stick himself into the government, as he says.”\n Sancho once more kissed the duchess’s hand, and entreated her to let good care be taken of his Dapple, for he was the light of his eyes.\n “What is Dapple?” said the duchess.\n “My ass,” said Sancho, “which, not to mention him by that name, I’m accustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duenna here to take care of him when I came into the castle, and she got as angry as if I had said she was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural and proper for duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers. God bless me! what a spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!”\n “He must have been some clown,” said Dona Rodriguez the duenna; “for if he had been a gentleman and well-born he would have exalted them higher than the horns of the moon.”\n “That will do,” said the duchess; “no more of this; hush, Dona Rodriguez, and let Senor Panza rest easy and leave the treatment of Dapple in my charge, for as he is a treasure of Sancho’s , I’ll put him on the apple of my eye.”\n “It will be enough for him to he in the stable,” said Sancho, “for neither he nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of your highness’s eye, and I’d as soon stab myself as consent to it; for though my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a card too many than a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses we must mind what we are about and keep within due bounds.”\n “Take him to your government, Sancho,” said the duchess, “and there you will be able to make as much of him as you like, and even release him from work and pension him off.”\n “Don’t think, senora duchess, that you have said anything absurd,” said Sancho; “I have seen more than two asses go to governments, and for me to take mine with me would he nothing new.”\n Sancho’s words made the duchess laugh again and gave her fresh amusement, and dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the duke the conversation she had had with him, and between them they plotted and arranged to play a joke upon Don Quixote that was to be a rare one and entirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style they practised several upon him, so much in keeping and so clever that they form the best adventures this great history contains.\n \n 据说桑乔那天没有睡午觉，因为他有言在先，所以吃完饭就去找公爵夫人了。公爵夫人很愿意听桑乔说话，就让他坐在自己身旁的矮凳上。桑乔很有教养，不肯坐。公爵夫人就让他以总督的身份坐下来，以侍从的身份说话。有这两种身份，就是勇士锡德·鲁伊·迪亚斯的椅子也能坐。桑乔耸了耸肩膀，表示服从，便坐下了。公爵夫人的所有女仆都过来了，极其安静地围着桑乔，想听听他到底讲什么。不料公爵夫人先开了口，她说道：\n “趁着现在没有外人在场听咱们说话，我想请教一下总督大人。我读了已经出版的那本写伟大骑士唐吉诃德的小说，有几个疑问，其中一个就是善良的桑乔既然没见过杜尔西内亚，我指的是托博索的杜尔西内亚夫人，也没有替唐吉诃德大人带信去，因为那封信还留在莫雷纳山唐吉诃德的记事本上，桑乔怎么敢大胆瞎编，说什么他看见杜尔西内亚夫人正在筛麦子呢？这是一派胡言，既不利于举世无双的杜尔西内亚的名誉，也与忠诚侍从的身份和品性不相称嘛。”\n 桑乔一句话也没回答，站起身来，弯着腰，把手指放在嘴唇上，轻手轻脚沿着整个客厅走了一遍，又把所有窗帘都掀起来看了看，然后才重新坐下说道：\n “夫人，我刚才已经看过了，除了在场的各位之外，没有人偷听咱们的谈话。现在，无论是您刚才那个问题还是其他任何问题，我都可以放心大胆地回答了。我首先要告诉您的是，我的主人唐吉诃德是个十足的疯子，尽管有时候他说起事情来让我觉得，甚至让所有听他议论的人都觉得，他讲得明明白白，头头是道，连魔鬼都比不上。即使这样，我也可以坦率地说，他是个疯子。这点我已经想象到了，所以才敢瞎编一些完全是无中生有的事情，例如那次回信的事。还有一件七八天前的事，这件事还没写进小说里去呢，我认为应该写进去，那就是我们的夫人杜尔西内亚中魔法的事儿。我告诉他杜尔西内亚中了魔法，其实那是没影儿的事。”\n 公爵夫人请桑乔讲讲那件事儿或者说那个玩笑，桑乔就一五一十地讲了一遍，在场的人都听得津津有味。后来公爵夫人说：\n “听了这位好桑乔讲的事儿，我不禁心生疑窦，仿佛有个确确实实的声音在我耳边说：‘如果曼查的唐吉诃德是个疯子、笨蛋，是个头脑发昏的人，而且他的侍从桑乔对此很清楚，尽管如此桑乔还是服侍他，跟随他，仍然执著地相信唐吉诃德那些不可能实现的诺言，那么，桑乔一定比自己的主人更疯癫、更愚蠢。既然这样，公爵夫人，你打算把岛屿交给他去管就是失策了。他连自己都管不好，怎么能管得好其他人呢？”\n “上帝保佑，夫人，”桑乔说，“您这个疑虑来得真突然。不过您尽可以直言，或者随您怎么说吧，我承认您说的是事实。我要是聪明的话，早就离开我的主人了。可这就是我的命运，是我的不幸。我只能跟随他。我们是同一个地方的人，我服侍过他，他是知恩图报的人，把他的几头驴驹给了我。更重要的是，我是个忠心的人。现在除了铁锹和锄头，已经没有任何东西能把我们分开了。如果您不愿意把已经答应的总督位置给我，我当总督就没希望了。不过，不当总督我心里更踏实。我虽然不聪明，却懂得‘蚂蚁遭祸因为长翅膀’，说不定当侍从的桑乔比当总督的桑乔更容易升天堂哩。‘此地彼处一样好’，‘夜晚猫儿都是褐色的’，‘人最大的不幸是下午两点还没吃上早饭’，‘谁的胃也不比别人的胃大多少’。而且就像人们常说的，‘不管是好是赖都能吃饱’，‘田间小鸟自有上帝供养’，‘四米昆卡粗呢比四米塞戈维亚细呢更保暖’呢。当我们离开这个世界入土的时候，无论是君主还是工友，都得同走这条狭路，无论是教皇还是教堂司事，谁的身体也多占不了地方，尽管前者比后者的身份高得多。只要进了坟墓，我们都得收缩，或者不由自主地收缩，不管我们愿意不愿意，不管我们知道不知道。\n “我再说一遍，如果您觉得我笨，不愿意把岛屿给我，我知道这跟聪明不聪明根本没关系。我听说，‘十字架后有魔鬼’，‘闪光的不一定都是金子’。如果古代叙事歌谣没有说谎的话，赶牛使犁拉轭绳的庄稼汉万巴后来成了西班牙国王；而细绸锦缎、花天酒地和堆金积玉的国王罗德里戈后来却被喂了蛇。”\n “怎么会说谎呢！”一直在旁边听着的那个女仆唐娜罗德里格斯插嘴道，“有一首歌谣就说罗德里戈国王被活活扔进一个满是癞蛤蟆、毒蛇和蜥蜴的坑里。两天之后，国王还在坑里低声沉痛地哼哼道：\n 我的身上罪恶重，\n 它们就在我身上咬。\n 由此说来，这位大人说他宁愿做农夫而不愿做国王就很有道理了，免得被那些爬虫吃了。”\n 听了女仆的这些蠢话，公爵夫人可笑不出来了。同时，她对桑乔的那番议论和成串的俗语感到惊奇，对桑乔说道：\n “你知道，好桑乔，君子一言，即使豁出性命也得兑现。我的丈夫公爵大人虽然不是游侠骑士，但这并不等于他不是君子，所以他一定会履行他的诺言，把岛屿给你，不管其他人如何嫉妒，如何捣乱。打起精神来吧，桑乔，你会在你意想不到的时候坐上岛屿总督的宝座，行使你的管辖权。除非以后有更好的美差，你千万不要放弃。我要提醒你，你要注意管好你的臣民，他们都忠心耿耿，而且出身高贵。”\n “应该好好管理他们之类的话不用您嘱咐我，”桑乔说，“我生性仁慈，而且同情穷人。别人的事情别人做，谁也别惦记。我凭我的信仰发誓，谁也别想哄我。我也算个老家伙了，什么都见过。我知道该怎么应付事儿，谁也别想糊弄我，我自己怎么回事我自己知道。我说这些话无非是说，谁若是对我好，什么都好商量，若是对我不好，那就什么都别提了。我觉得当总督这样的事关键在于开头，等当了一段时间后就会得心应手，而且会比我从小就熟悉的农村活计更熟悉。”\n “你说得对，桑乔，”公爵夫人说，“谁也不是生来就会做事的。主教也来自人间，而不是石头造就的。不过，咱们还是回到刚才谈到的杜尔西内亚夫人中魔法那件事上来吧。我现在已经查明，桑乔自以为他戏弄了主人，让主人以为那个农妇就是杜尔西内亚，如果主人没有认出杜尔西内亚，那就是杜尔西内亚被魔法改变了模样，所有这些都是跟唐吉诃德大人过不去的某个魔法师一手造成的。但是我确信，跳上驴背的那个农妇真的是托博索的杜尔西内亚。善良的桑乔以为他骗了人，其实是他自己被骗了。有些事我们虽然没亲眼看到，却是确凿无疑的事实。桑乔你应该知道，我们这儿也有魔法师，只不过他们对我们很友好，告诉我们世界上发生的各种事情，而且原原本本，没有任何编造。相信我吧，桑乔，那个跳上驴背的农妇就是托博索的杜尔西内亚，此事千真万确！说不定哪一天，咱们就会看到杜尔西内亚的本来面目，到那个时候桑乔就会明白是自己上当了。”\n “这倒完全有可能。”桑乔说，“我现在愿意相信，我的主人介绍的他在蒙特西诺斯洞窟里的见闻都是真的，他说他看见杜尔西内亚夫人穿的就是我胡说她被魔法改变模样后穿的那套衣服。可是若照夫人您所说，这一切都该是相反的。我的低下智力既不会也不应该一下子编出那么完整的谎话来。我的主人即使再疯癫，也不会相信一套如此荒诞离奇的事情。夫人，您不要以为我有什么坏心，像我这样一个笨蛋，不可能识破魔法师的恶毒诡计。我编造那个谎话是为了逃脱主人对我的惩罚，并不是存心同他捣乱。如果事与愿违，有上帝在天上可以明断。”\n “此话有理，”公爵夫人说，“不过桑乔，你给我讲讲蒙特西诺斯洞窟是怎么回事吧，我很想听呢。”\n 于是，桑乔又把那次经历的事情讲了一遍。公爵夫人听罢说道：\n “从这件事里可以推断出，伟大的唐吉诃德说他看到了桑乔在托博索城外看到的那位农妇，那么她肯定就是杜尔西内亚。那儿的魔法师都很精明，很不一般。”\n “所以我说，”桑乔说，“如果我们的杜尔西内亚夫人中了魔法，那就由她去受罪吧。我犯不着去同我主人的冤家对头打架，他们人数很多，又很恶毒。我看到了一位农妇，这是事实，我觉得她是个农妇，所以就认为她是农妇了。如果那人是杜尔西内亚，我并不知情，所以不怨我，无论如何也不能怨我。你们不要总是怨我，整天吵吵嚷嚷什么‘这是桑乔说的’，‘这是桑乔做的’，‘这又是桑乔做的’，‘这还是桑乔干的’，就好像桑乔是谁都可以指责的人，而不是桑乔本来那个人，参孙·卡拉斯科说的那个已经被写进书里的桑乔似的。参孙·卡拉斯科至少是在萨拉曼卡毕业的学士，他不应该说谎，除非是别有用心。所以，谁也没必要跟我过不去，我已经名声在外了。我听我主人说，一个人的名声比很多财富都重要。所以，还是让我去当总督吧，我一定会放大家喜出望外。能当好侍从的人，也能当好总督。”\n “善良的桑乔刚才说的全是卡顿式的警句，”公爵夫人说，“至少像英年早逝的米卡埃尔·贝里诺的思想，就像他自己说的那样，‘穿破衣不妨有海量’。”\n “是的，夫人，”桑乔说，“我这辈子从没喝多过，除非有时候口渴了。我从来也不装模作样，想喝就喝，不想喝的时候，如果有人请我喝，为了不让人以为我假惺惺或者没规矩，我也喝。朋友请我干一杯，我不回敬人家一杯，那心肠也未免太狠了吧？不过，我虽然常在河边走，就是不湿鞋。况且，游侠骑士的侍从平时只喝水，因为他们常常出没于深山老林，走荒野，攀峭壁，即使出再大的价钱，也换不到一丁点儿葡萄酒。”\n “我也这样认为。”公爵夫人说，“现在，让桑乔先去休息吧，然后咱们再长谈。我们很快就会像桑乔说的那样，把他放到总督职位上去。”\n 桑乔又吻了公爵夫人的手，并请求公爵夫人照看好他的灰灰儿，灰灰儿简直就是他的命根子。\n “什么灰灰儿？”公爵夫人问。\n “就是我的驴。”桑乔说，“我不愿意叫它驴，所以叫它灰灰。我刚到城堡时，曾请求那位女仆帮我照看它，结果把她吓成那个样子，好像谁说她丑了或者老了似的。其实，喂牲口跟在客厅里装门面相比更是她份内的事。上帝保信，我们家乡有个绅士，对这种婆娘简直讨厌透了！”\n “他大概是个乡巴佬吧。”女佣唐娜罗德里格斯说，“如果他是个绅士，有教养，就会把女仆们捧上天。”\n “好了，”公爵夫人说，“别再说了，唐娜罗德里格斯快住嘴吧，桑乔大人也静一静，照管灰灰的事儿由我负责。既然它是桑乔的宠物，我一定会像对待自己的眼睛一样对待它。”\n “让它呆在马厩里就行了。”桑乔说，“要说您像对待自己的眼睛一样对待它，无论是它还是我，都实在不敢当，让我简直如坐针毡。尽管我的主人说过，即使输牌，也要先输大的，可是对驴就不一样了，应该照章办事，公事公办。”\n “你带着驴去上任当总督吧，”公爵夫人说，“到了那儿，你可以如意地伺候它，也可以让它退休。”\n “公爵夫人，”桑乔说，“您不要以为您说得言过其实了。我就见过至少有两个人是骑着驴去当总督的。所以，我骑着我的驴上任当总督也算不得新鲜事儿。”\n 桑乔这番话又惹得公爵夫人开心地大笑起来。她打发桑乔去休息，自己则把刚刚发生的事情都告诉了公爵。两人又一同策划完全按招待骑士的那套方法招待唐吉诃德，好拿他开开心。他们的玩笑开得精彩别致，在这部巨著里是十分出色的。\n \n
