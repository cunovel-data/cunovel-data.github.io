{"id":42254,"no":114,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 60","content":"It was a fresh morning giving promise of a cool day as Don Quixote quitted the inn, first of all taking care to ascertain the most direct road to Barcelona without touching upon Saragossa; so anxious was he to make out this new historian, who they said abused him so, to be a liar. Well, as it fell out, nothing worthy of being recorded happened him for six days, at the end of which, having turned aside out of the road, he was overtaken by night in a thicket of oak or cork trees; for on this point Cide Hamete is not as precise as he usually is on other matters.\n Master and man dismounted from their beasts, and as soon as they had settled themselves at the foot of the trees, Sancho, who had had a good noontide meal that day, let himself, without more ado, pass the gates of sleep. But Don Quixote, whom his thoughts, far more than hunger, kept awake, could not close an eye, and roamed in fancy to and fro through all sorts of places. At one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave of Montesinos and saw Dulcinea, transformed into a country wench, skipping and mounting upon her she-ass; again that the words of the sage Merlin were sounding in his ears, setting forth the conditions to be observed and the exertions to be made for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. He lost all patience when he considered the laziness and want of charity of his squire Sancho; for to the best of his belief he had only given himself five lashes, a number paltry and disproportioned to the vast number required. At this thought he felt such vexation and anger that he reasoned the matter thus: “If Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot, saying, ‘To cut comes to the same thing as to untie,’ and yet did not fail to become lord paramount of all Asia, neither more nor less could happen now in Dulcinea’s disenchantment if I scourge Sancho against his will; for, if it is the condition of the remedy that Sancho shall receive three thousand and odd lashes, what does it matter to me whether he inflicts them himself, or some one else inflicts them, when the essential point is that he receives them, let them come from whatever quarter they may?”\n With this idea he went over to Sancho, having first taken Rocinante’s reins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him with them, and began to untie the points (the common belief is he had but one in front) by which his breeches were held up; but the instant he approached him Sancho woke up in his full senses and cried out, “What is this? Who is touching me and untrussing me?”\n “It is I,” said Don Quixote, “and I come to make good thy shortcomings and relieve my own distresses; I come to whip thee, Sancho, and wipe off some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken. Dulcinea is perishing, thou art living on regardless, I am dying of hope deferred; therefore untruss thyself with a good will, for mine it is, here, in this retired spot, to give thee at least two thousand lashes.”\n “Not a bit of it,” said Sancho; “let your worship keep quiet, or else by the living God the deaf shall hear us; the lashes I pledged myself to must be voluntary and not forced upon me, and just now I have no fancy to whip myself; it is enough if I give you my word to flog and flap myself when I have a mind.”\n “It will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender of flesh;” and at the same time he strove and struggled to untie him.\n Seeing this Sancho got up, and grappling with his master he gripped him with all his might in his arms, giving him a trip with the heel stretched him on the ground on his back, and pressing his right knee on his chest held his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathe.\n “How now, traitor!” exclaimed Don Quixote. “Dost thou revolt against thy master and natural lord? Dost thou rise against him who gives thee his bread?”\n “I neither put down king, nor set up king,” said Sancho; “I only stand up for myself who am my own lord; if your worship promises me to be quiet, and not to offer to whip me now, I’ll let you go free and unhindered; if not —\n Traitor and Dona Sancha’s foe,\n Thou diest on the spot.”\n Don Quixote gave his promise, and swore by the life of his thoughts not to touch so much as a hair of his garments, and to leave him entirely free and to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased.\n \n Sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot, but as he was about to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his head, and putting up his hands encountered somebody’s two feet with shoes and stockings on them. He trembled with fear and made for another tree, where the very same thing happened to him, and he fell a-shouting, calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him. Don Quixote did so, and asked him what had happened to him, and what he was afraid of. Sancho replied that all the trees were full of men’s feet and legs. Don Quixote felt them, and guessed at once what it was, and said to Sancho, “Thou hast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet and legs that thou feelest but canst not see belong no doubt to some outlaws and freebooters that have been hanged on these trees; for the authorities in these parts are wont to hang them up by twenties and thirties when they catch them; whereby I conjecture that I must be near Barcelona;” and it was, in fact, as he supposed; with the first light they looked up and saw that the fruit hanging on those trees were freebooters’ bodies.\n And now day dawned; and if the dead freebooters had scared them, their hearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones, who all of a sudden surrounded them, and in the Catalan tongue bade them stand and wait until their captain came up. Don Quixote was on foot with his horse unbridled and his lance leaning against a tree, and in short completely defenceless; he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow his head and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity. The robbers made haste to search Dapple, and did not leave him a single thing of all he carried in the alforjas and in the valise; and lucky it was for Sancho that the duke’s crowns and those he brought from home were in a girdle that he wore round him; but for all that these good folk would have stripped him, and even looked to see what he had hidden between the skin and flesh, but for the arrival at that moment of their captain, who was about thirty-four years of age apparently, strongly built, above the middle height, of stern aspect and swarthy complexion. He was mounted upon a powerful horse, and had on a coat of mail, with four of the pistols they call petronels in that country at his waist. He saw that his squires (for so they call those who follow that trade) were about to rifle Sancho Panza, but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed, so the girdle escaped. He wondered to see the lance leaning against the tree, the shield on the ground, and Don Quixote in armour and dejected, with the saddest and most melancholy face that sadness itself could produce; and going up to him he said, “Be not so cast down, good man, for you have not fallen into the hands of any inhuman Busiris, but into Roque Guinart’s , which are more merciful than cruel.”\n “The cause of my dejection,” returned Don Quixote, “is not that I have fallen into thy hands, O valiant Roque, whose fame is bounded by no limits on earth, but that my carelessness should have been so great that thy soldiers should have caught me unbridled, when it is my duty, according to the rule of knight-errantry which I profess, to be always on the alert and at all times my own sentinel; for let me tell thee, great Roque, had they found me on my horse, with my lance and shield, it would not have been very easy for them to reduce me to submission, for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, he who hath filled the whole world with his achievements.”\n Roque Guinart at once perceived that Don Quixote’s weakness was more akin to madness than to swagger; and though he had sometimes heard him spoken of, he never regarded the things attributed to him as true, nor could he persuade himself that such a humour could become dominant in the heart of man; he was extremely glad, therefore, to meet him and test at close quarters what he had heard of him at a distance; so he said to him, “Despair not, valiant knight, nor regard as an untoward fate the position in which thou findest thyself; it may be that by these slips thy crooked fortune will make itself straight; for heaven by strange circuitous ways, mysterious and incomprehensible to man, raises up the fallen and makes rich the poor.”\n Don Quixote was about to thank him, when they heard behind them a noise as of a troop of horses; there was, however, but one, riding on which at a furious pace came a youth, apparently about twenty years of age, clad in green damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock, with a hat looped up in the Walloon fashion, tight-fitting polished boots, gilt spurs, dagger and sword, and in his hand a musketoon, and a pair of pistols at his waist.\n Roque turned round at the noise and perceived this comely figure, which drawing near thus addressed him, “I came in quest of thee, valiant Roque, to find in thee if not a remedy at least relief in my misfortune; and not to keep thee in suspense, for I see thou dost not recognise me, I will tell thee who I am; I am Claudia Jeronima, the daughter of Simon Forte, thy good friend, and special enemy of Clauquel Torrellas, who is thine also as being of the faction opposed to thee. Thou knowest that this Torrellas has a son who is called, or at least was not two hours since, Don Vicente Torrellas. Well, to cut short the tale of my misfortune, I will tell thee in a few words what this youth has brought upon me. He saw me, he paid court to me, I listened to him, and, unknown to my father, I loved him; for there is no woman, however secluded she may live or close she may be kept, who will not have opportunities and to spare for following her headlong impulses. In a word, he pledged himself to be mine, and I promised to be his, without carrying matters any further. Yesterday I learned that, forgetful of his pledge to me, he was about to marry another, and that he was to go this morning to plight his troth, intelligence which overwhelmed and exasperated me; my father not being at home I was able to adopt this costume you see, and urging my horse to speed I overtook Don Vicente about a league from this, and without waiting to utter reproaches or hear excuses I fired this musket at him, and these two pistols besides, and to the best of my belief I must have lodged more than two bullets in his body, opening doors to let my honour go free, enveloped in his blood. I left him there in the hands of his servants, who did not dare and were not able to interfere in his defence, and I come to seek from thee a safe-conduct into France, where I have relatives with whom I can live; and also to implore thee to protect my father, so that Don Vicente’s numerous kinsmen may not venture to wreak their lawless vengeance upon him.”\n Roque, filled with admiration at the gallant bearing, high spirit, comely figure, and adventure of the fair Claudia, said to her, “Come, senora, let us go and see if thy enemy is dead; and then we will consider what will be best for thee.” Don Quixote, who had been listening to what Claudia said and Roque Guinart said in reply to her, exclaimed, “Nobody need trouble himself with the defence of this lady, for I take it upon myself. Give me my horse and arms, and wait for me here; I will go in quest of this knight, and dead or alive I will make him keep his word plighted to so great beauty.”\n “Nobody need have any doubt about that,” said Sancho, “for my master has a very happy knack of matchmaking; it’s not many days since he forced another man to marry, who in the same way backed out of his promise to another maiden; and if it had not been for his persecutors the enchanters changing the man’s proper shape into a lacquey’s the said maiden would not be one this minute.”\n Roque, who was paying more attention to the fair Claudia’s adventure than to the words of master or man, did not hear them; and ordering his squires to restore to Sancho everything they had stripped Dapple of, he directed them to return to the place where they had been quartered during the night, and then set off with Claudia at full speed in search of the wounded or slain Don Vicente. They reached the spot where Claudia met him, but found nothing there save freshly spilt blood; looking all round, however, they descried some people on the slope of a hill above them, and concluded, as indeed it proved to be, that it was Don Vicente, whom either dead or alive his servants were removing to attend to his wounds or to bury him. They made haste to overtake them, which, as the party moved slowly, they were able to do with ease. They found Don Vicente in the arms of his servants, whom he was entreating in a broken feeble voice to leave him there to die, as the pain of his wounds would not suffer him to go any farther. Claudia and Roque threw themselves off their horses and advanced towards him; the servants were overawed by the appearance of Roque, and Claudia was moved by the sight of Don Vicente, and going up to him half tenderly half sternly, she seized his hand and said to him, “Hadst thou given me this according to our compact thou hadst never come to this pass.”\n The wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes, and recognising Claudia said, “I see clearly, fair and mistaken lady, that it is thou that hast slain me, a punishment not merited or deserved by my feelings towards thee, for never did I mean to, nor could I, wrong thee in thought or deed.”\n “It is not true, then,” said Claudia, “that thou wert going this morning to marry Leonora the daughter of the rich Balvastro?”\n “Assuredly not,” replied Don Vicente; “my cruel fortune must have carried those tidings to thee to drive thee in thy jealousy to take my life; and to assure thyself of this, press my hands and take me for thy husband if thou wilt; I have no better satisfaction to offer thee for the wrong thou fanciest thou hast received from me.”\n Claudia wrung his hands, and her own heart was so wrung that she lay fainting on the bleeding breast of Don Vicente, whom a death spasm seized the same instant. Roque was in perplexity and knew not what to do; the servants ran to fetch water to sprinkle their faces, and brought some and bathed them with it. Claudia recovered from her fainting fit, but not so Don Vicente from the paroxysm that had overtaken him, for his life had come to an end. On perceiving this, Claudia, when she had convinced herself that her beloved husband was no more, rent the air with her sighs and made the heavens ring with her lamentations; she tore her hair and scattered it to the winds, she beat her face with her hands and showed all the signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from an afflicted heart. “Cruel, reckless woman!” she cried, “how easily wert thou moved to carry out a thought so wicked! O furious force of jealousy, to what desperate lengths dost thou lead those that give thee lodging in their bosoms! O husband, whose unhappy fate in being mine hath borne thee from the marriage bed to the grave!”\n So vehement and so piteous were the lamentations of Claudia that they drew tears from Roque’s eyes, unused as they were to shed them on any occasion. The servants wept, Claudia swooned away again and again, and the whole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune. In the end Roque Guinart directed Don Vicente’s servants to carry his body to his father’s village, which was close by, for burial. Claudia told him she meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers was abbess, where she intended to pass her life with a better and everlasting spouse. He applauded her pious resolution, and offered to accompany her whithersoever she wished, and to protect her father against the kinsmen of Don Vicente and all the world, should they seek to injure him. Claudia would not on any account allow him to accompany her; and thanking him for his offers as well as she could, took leave of him in tears. The servants of Don Vicente carried away his body, and Roque returned to his comrades, and so ended the love of Claudia Jeronima; but what wonder, when it was the insuperable and cruel might of jealousy that wove the web of her sad story?\n \n Roque Guinart found his squires at the place to which he had ordered them, and Don Quixote on Rocinante in the midst of them delivering a harangue to them in which he urged them to give up a mode of life so full of peril, as well to the soul as to the body; but as most of them were Gascons, rough lawless fellows, his speech did not make much impression on them. Roque on coming up asked Sancho if his men had returned and restored to him the treasures and jewels they had stripped off Dapple. Sancho said they had, but that three kerchiefs that were worth three cities were missing.\n “What are you talking about, man?” said one of the bystanders; “I have got them, and they are not worth three reals.”\n “That is true,” said Don Quixote; “but my squire values them at the rate he says, as having been given me by the person who gave them.”\n Roque Guinart ordered them to be restored at once; and making his men fall in in line he directed all the clothing, jewellery, and money that they had taken since the last distribution to be produced; and making a hasty valuation, and reducing what could not be divided into money, he made shares for the whole band so equitably and carefully, that in no case did he exceed or fall short of strict distributive justice.\n When this had been done, and all left satisfied, Roque observed to Don Quixote, “If this scrupulous exactness were not observed with these fellows there would be no living with them.”\n Upon this Sancho remarked, “From what I have seen here, justice is such a good thing that there is no doing without it, even among the thieves themselves.”\n One of the squires heard this, and raising the butt-end of his harquebuss would no doubt have broken Sancho’s head with it had not Roque Guinart called out to him to hold his hand. Sancho was frightened out of his wits, and vowed not to open his lips so long as he was in the company of these people.\n At this instant one or two of those squires who were posted as sentinels on the roads, to watch who came along them and report what passed to their chief, came up and said, “Senor, there is a great troop of people not far off coming along the road to Barcelona.”\n To which Roque replied, “Hast thou made out whether they are of the sort that are after us, or of the sort we are after?”\n “The sort we are after,” said the squire.\n “Well then, away with you all,” said Roque, “and bring them here to me at once without letting one of them escape.”\n \n They obeyed, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and Roque, left by themselves, waited to see what the squires brought, and while they were waiting Roque said to Don Quixote, “It must seem a strange sort of life to Senor Don Quixote, this of ours, strange adventures, strange incidents, and all full of danger; and I do not wonder that it should seem so, for in truth I must own there is no mode of life more restless or anxious than ours. What led me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance, which is strong enough to disturb the quietest hearts. I am by nature tender-hearted and kindly, but, as I said, the desire to revenge myself for a wrong that was done me so overturns all my better impulses that I keep on in this way of life in spite of what conscience tells me; and as one depth calls to another, and one sin to another sin, revenges have linked themselves together, and I have taken upon myself not only my own but those of others: it pleases God, however, that, though I see myself in this maze of entanglements, I do not lose all hope of escaping from it and reaching a safe port.”\n Don Quixote was amazed to hear Roque utter such excellent and just sentiments, for he did not think that among those who followed such trades as robbing, murdering, and waylaying, there could be anyone capable of a virtuous thought, and he said in reply, “Senor Roque, the beginning of health lies in knowing the disease and in the sick man’s willingness to take the medicines which the physician prescribes; you are sick, you know what ails you, and heaven, or more properly speaking God, who is our physician, will administer medicines that will cure you, and cure gradually, and not of a sudden or by a miracle; besides, sinners of discernment are nearer amendment than those who are fools; and as your worship has shown good sense in your remarks, all you have to do is to keep up a good heart and trust that the weakness of your conscience will be strengthened. And if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation, come with me, and I will show you how to become a knight-errant, a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice.”\n Roque laughed at Don Quixote’s exhortation, and changing the conversation he related the tragic affair of Claudia Jeronima, at which Sancho was extremely grieved; for he had not found the young woman’s beauty, boldness, and spirit at all amiss.\n And now the squires despatched to make the prize came up, bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback, two pilgrims on foot, and a coach full of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on them, and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them. The squires made a ring round them, both victors and vanquished maintaining profound silence, waiting for the great Roque Guinart to speak. He asked the gentlemen who they were, whither they were going, and what money they carried with them; “Senor,” replied one of them, “we are two captains of Spanish infantry; our companies are at Naples, and we are on our way to embark in four galleys which they say are at Barcelona under orders for Sicily; and we have about two or three hundred crowns, with which we are, according to our notions, rich and contented, for a soldier’s poverty does not allow a more extensive hoard.”\n Roque asked the pilgrims the same questions he had put to the captains, and was answered that they were going to take ship for Rome, and that between them they might have about sixty reals. He asked also who was in the coach, whither they were bound and what money they had, and one of the men on horseback replied, “The persons in the coach are my lady Dona Guiomar de Quinones, wife of the regent of the Vicaria at Naples, her little daughter, a handmaid and a duenna; we six servants are in attendance upon her, and the money amounts to six hundred crowns.”\n “So then,” said Roque Guinart, “we have got here nine hundred crowns and sixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; see how much there falls to each, for I am a bad arithmetician.” As soon as the robbers heard this they raised a shout of “Long life to Roque Guinart, in spite of the lladres that seek his ruin!”\n The captains showed plainly the concern they felt, the regent’s lady was downcast, and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated. Roque kept them in suspense in this way for a while; but he had no desire to prolong their distress, which might be seen a bowshot off, and turning to the captains he said, “Sirs, will your worships be pleased of your courtesy to lend me sixty crowns, and her ladyship the regent’s wife eighty, to satisfy this band that follows me, for ‘it is by his singing the abbot gets his dinner;’ and then you may at once proceed on your journey, free and unhindered, with a safe-conduct which I shall give you, so that if you come across any other bands of mine that I have scattered in these parts, they may do you no harm; for I have no intention of doing injury to soldiers, or to any woman, especially one of quality.”\n Profuse and hearty were the expressions of gratitude with which the captains thanked Roque for his courtesy and generosity; for such they regarded his leaving them their own money. Senora Dona Guiomar de Quinones wanted to throw herself out of the coach to kiss the feet and hands of the great Roque, but he would not suffer it on any account; so far from that, he begged her pardon for the wrong he had done her under pressure of the inexorable necessities of his unfortunate calling. The regent’s lady ordered one of her servants to give the eighty crowns that had been assessed as her share at once, for the captains had already paid down their sixty. The pilgrims were about to give up the whole of their little hoard, but Roque bade them keep quiet, and turning to his men he said, “Of these crowns two fall to each man and twenty remain over; let ten be given to these pilgrims, and the other ten to this worthy squire that he may be able to speak favourably of this adventure;” and then having writing materials, with which he always went provided, brought to him, he gave them in writing a safe-conduct to the leaders of his bands; and bidding them farewell let them go free and filled with admiration at his magnanimity, his generous disposition, and his unusual conduct, and inclined to regard him as an Alexander the Great rather than a notorious robber.\n One of the squires observed in his mixture of Gascon and Catalan, “This captain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman; if he wants to be so generous another time, let it be with his own property and not ours.”\n \n The unlucky wight did not speak so low but that Roque overheard him, and drawing his sword almost split his head in two, saying, “That is the way I punish impudent saucy fellows.” They were all taken aback, and not one of them dared to utter a word, such deference did they pay him. Roque then withdrew to one side and wrote a letter to a friend of his at Barcelona, telling him that the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the knight-errant of whom there was so much talk, was with him, and was, he assured him, the drollest and wisest man in the world; and that in four days from that date, that is to say, on Saint John the Baptist’s Day, he was going to deposit him in full armour mounted on his horse Rocinante, together with his squire Sancho on an ass, in the middle of the strand of the city; and bidding him give notice of this to his friends the Niarros, that they might divert themselves with him. He wished, he said, his enemies the Cadells could be deprived of this pleasure; but that was impossible, because the crazes and shrewd sayings of Don Quixote and the humours of his squire Sancho Panza could not help giving general pleasure to all the world. He despatched the letter by one of his squires, who, exchanging the costume of a highwayman for that of a peasant, made his way into Barcelona and gave it to the person to whom it was directed.\n \n 唐吉诃德离开客店的那个早晨，天气很凉爽，看样子全天也不会热。他已打听好哪条路可以直奔巴塞罗那而不必绕道萨拉戈萨，目的是要揭穿那本新书作者的谎言，因为听说作者对他进行了恶毒攻击。他们走了六天路，没遇到什么可以记述的事情。六天后，他们离开了大路，刚走进树林，天就黑了。记事准确的锡德·哈迈德这次没有说明那是橡树林还是栓皮槠树林。\n 两人从牲口背上下来，靠在树干上休息。桑乔那天已吃饱了，马上便进入了梦乡。唐吉诃德却合不上眼，主要不是由于饿，是由于思绪万千而不能成眠。他的思绪到处飘荡，一会儿觉得自己到了蒙特西诺斯洞窟，一会儿又看到被变成农妇的杜尔西内亚跳上了她那头母驴，接着又听到贤人梅尔林的话语在耳边回响，提醒他如何才能解除附在杜尔西内亚身上的魔法。他见桑乔仅打了自己五下，离所需数目差得太远了，又气又恼，心中想：“如果亚历山大大帝割断了戈迪乌斯的绳结，说‘割断就算解开了’，而且并没有因此就没能主宰整个亚洲，那么，要解除附在杜尔西内亚身上的魔法，也可以采用这种办法，也就是不管桑乔愿意不愿意，由我来鞭打他。既然为杜尔西内亚解除魔法的条件就是桑乔挨三千多鞭子，那么，由我打，让他自己打，或是让其他人打，都是一样的。因为关键在于挨打的是他，不管是由谁来打。”\n 于是，唐吉诃德首先解开了罗西南多的缰绳，做好了鞭打的准备，然后来到桑乔身边，开始解桑乔的腰带，他知道桑乔只用一条带子系着自己的肥腿裤。但是不等他解开带子，桑乔就醒了。桑乔马上睡意全消，问道：\n “怎么回事，是谁在动我？谁在解我的腰带？”\n “是我，”唐吉诃德说，“我来帮你完成你尚欠的部分，同时也解除我的烦恼。我来抽打你，桑乔，让你偿还你欠的那部分债。杜尔西内亚受尽了折磨，你却在这里无动于衷，我都快急死了。最好是你自己解开裤子，让我在这荒郊野岭打你至少两千鞭子吧。”\n “不行，”桑乔说，“您还是老实点儿，否则我向上帝发誓，我会闹得让聋子都能听见咱们的动静。让我抽打自己必须是心甘情愿的，不能强迫，可现在我不想打自己。我告诉您，当我愿意的时候，我一定会抽打自己，这就够了。”\n “不能由着你来，”唐吉诃德说，“你心肠冷酷，而且人虽然是乡巴佬，皮肉却挺嫩的。”\n 唐吉诃德还是要解开桑乔的裤子。桑乔见状站了起来，扑向主人，双手抓着他，脚下一绊，把唐吉诃德推了个仰面朝天，摔倒在地。接着，桑乔又用右膝盖压住唐吉诃德的胸膛，按住唐吉诃德的双手，让他动弹不得，连喘气都难。唐吉诃德说道：\n “你这个叛逆，竟敢跟你的主人造反？主人养活了你，你竟敢对主人无礼？”\n “我不偏不倚。”桑乔说，“我这是自己帮助自己，我就是我的主人。您答应老实点儿，现在不再想抽打我，我就放开您，否则的话——\n 你就死定了，叛逆，\n 唐娜桑查的敌人①！”\n ①这里引用的是民歌里的句子。\n 唐吉诃德答应了，他以自己的生命发誓，连桑乔衣服上的一根毛也不想碰了，而且同意桑乔在他愿意的时候自觉自愿地鞭打自己。桑乔站起身，走出很远，才靠在一棵树上。可是，他忽然觉得有什么东西碰到了他的脑袋，伸手一摸，竟是两只穿着鞋袜的人脚。桑乔吓得直发抖，赶紧跑到另一棵树下，结果又遇到了同样的情况。他大声喊叫唐吉诃德来救他。唐吉诃德问他发生了什么事，是什么可怕的东西。桑乔回答说，那些树上全都挂满了人脚和人腿。唐吉诃德摸了一下，立刻猜到是怎么回事了。他对桑乔说道：\n “你没有必要害怕，这肯定是一些在树上被绞死的逃犯和强盗的脚和腿。这一带抓到逃犯和强盗，往往把二三十人或三四十人一起吊在树上绞死。我估计这儿离巴塞罗那不远了。”\n 事情果然不出唐吉诃德所料。\n 天蒙蒙亮时，唐吉诃德和桑乔抬眼细望，看到树上吊着的果然是强盗们的尸体。强盗尸体本来就把他们吓了一跳，不料，突然又有四十多个活强盗围住了他们，这一吓更是非同小可。强盗们用卡塔卢尼亚语告诉他们老实点儿，等着强盗们的头儿来。唐吉诃德站在那里，毫无防范，马没戴嚼子，长矛靠在树上。他只好抱着双臂，低着头，准备见机行事。\n 强盗们先搜查了驴，把褡裢和手提袋里的东西洗劫一空。桑乔暗自庆幸，公爵和公爵夫人送给他们的金盾和他们从家里带来的一些钱都藏在贴身的腰包里，没有被那些人拿走。若不是那些强盗的头目这时候到了，那些强盗说不定还会把他们里外搜个遍呢。强盗头儿看样子有三四十岁，身体挺结实，中等偏高的身材，目光严肃，皮肤黝黑。他骑着一匹高头大马，穿着一身铁甲，腰两边分别插着四只小火枪。他见他的侍从们正要剥桑乔的衣服，须知在他们那帮人里也称侍从，就命令不要再剥了，这样桑乔的腰包才算侥幸保存了下来。那个强盗头儿看到靠在树上的长矛、放在地上的盾牌和全身披挂、若有所思却又忧心忡忡的唐吉诃德，便走近唐吉诃德，说道：\n “不要难过，好兄弟，你并没有落到残忍的布西里斯①手里，而是在心地善良、并不残酷的罗克·吉纳德②手里。”\n “我并不是为落到你手里而难过，英勇的罗克，你的英名传颂遐迩。我只是怨自己一时大意，马未上鞍就被你的兵士围住了。按照我所奉行的游侠骑士道，我应该时刻警惕，永不懈怠。我应该告诉你，伟大的罗克，假如我是骑在我的马上，手持长矛和盾牌，要抓住我可不那么容易。我是曼查的唐吉诃德，我的业绩名扬四方。”\n 罗克·吉纳德马上就意识到了唐吉诃德的毛病，与其说这是吹牛，还不如说是疯癫。对此他虽然原来就有所耳闻，但从不认为确有其事，也不相信一个人会疯成这个样子。现在，他遇到了唐吉诃德本人，能够切身体验一下他听说的事情了。\n 他觉得很有意思，就对唐吉诃德说道：\n “英勇的骑士，不必心灰意冷，怨天尤人。现在看来是倒霉的事，可说不定你马上就会时来运转。老天做事总是神秘莫测，它常常会让跌倒的人重新站立起来，让穷人变成富人。”\n 唐吉诃德正要道谢，背后忽然传来一阵马蹄声。其实只有一匹马，一个小伙子疾驰而来，看样子最多二十岁，穿一身金边绿色锦缎肥腿裤和套头短上衣，头上像瓦龙人③那样斜戴着帽子，皮靴锃亮，马刺、剑和匕首都是镀金的。他手里拿着一只猎枪，腰两侧又各插着一只手枪。罗克循声回过头去，只见这英俊少年来到他身边说道：\n ①布西里斯是古希腊神话中的埃及国王，以残忍著称。\n ②罗克·吉纳德是西班牙的著名侠盗。\n ③瓦龙人是比利时南部的人。\n “喂，英勇的罗克，我是来找你的。即使你不能救助我，至少能减轻我的痛苦。你大概还没认出我来吧，为了不让你感到意外，我想先告诉你我是谁。我是西蒙·福特的女儿克劳迪娅·赫罗尼玛。我父亲和你是朋友，他也同你一样，是克劳克尔·托雷利亚斯的死对头。这个人是与你对立的帮派头头之一。你知道，托雷利亚斯有个儿子叫比森特·托雷利亚斯，至少刚才他还叫这个名字。这个……且让我长话短说，简单说几句我的不幸是如何引起的吧。他看上了我，向我求爱，我听信了他的话，背着父亲偷偷同他谈情说爱。一个女人，无论她住得多么偏僻，无论对她约束得多么紧，只要她想实现自己那骚动的欲望，就总能找到机会。后来，他答应做我的丈夫，我也答应做他的妻子，但只是说说而已。昨天，我听说，他已经忘了他对我的诺言，要同别的女人结婚了，今天上午就要举行婚礼。我知道后实在控制不住了，趁着父亲不在家，换上了这身衣服，骑着这匹马匆忙追赶，在离这儿约一西里远的地方追上了比森特。我没抱怨他，也没听他道歉，就用这只猎枪朝他开了一枪，又用这两只手枪补了两枪。我觉得他身上中的枪弹肯定不止两颗。我用他身上流淌的鲜血挽回了我的名誉。当我离开时，他的几个佣人围着他，那些佣人不敢也没能力起来抵抗。我来找你是想让你把我带到法国去，我在那儿有亲戚。同时，我还请求你保护我父亲，别让他们到我父亲那儿去报仇。”\n 罗克对美丽的克劳迪娅的绰约风姿、优美身材以及她的所作所为感到吃惊。他对克劳迪娅说道：\n “来吧，姑娘，咱们去看看你的对手死了没有，然后再说你到底应该干什么。”\n 唐吉诃德一直在仔细听着克劳迪娅和罗克·吉纳德的对话。唐吉诃德说道：\n “不用烦劳谁来保护这位姑娘了，这是我的事。把马和武器还给我，你们在这儿等着。无论那个青年是死是活，我都要找到他，让他履行对这位如此美丽的姑娘的诺言。”\n “对此谁也不用怀疑，”桑乔说，“我的主人在撮合婚姻方向很有一手。前不久，他还让另一个拒绝同姑娘履行结婚诺言的小伙子同那个姑娘结了婚。若不是魔法师把那个小伙子的本来面目变成了仆人模样，现在那姑娘早成媳妇了。”\n 罗克正在想美丽的克劳迪娅的事情，并没有注意唐吉诃德和桑乔的话。他让他的随从们把从桑乔那儿抢走的东西都还给桑乔，并且各自回到他们前一天晚上呆的地方去，然后就同克劳迪娅一起飞马去寻找那个受了伤或是已经死了的比森特。他们来到克劳迪娅说的那个地方，却没发现比森特，只见到地上有一滩鲜血。两人举目向四周望去，见到山坡上有一些人，估计是比森特和他的佣人们。果然不错，他的佣人不管他死没死，正抬着他走，也不知是要送他去治伤还是去掩埋他。两人赶紧追过去。那些人走得很慢，所以很快就赶上了他们。比森特被佣人们抬着，正用疲惫和微弱的声音请求佣人们让他死在那儿，伤口疼得太厉害了，他实在没法再走了。\n 克劳迪娅和罗克从马上跳下来，来到比森特身边。佣人们见罗克来了都很害怕。克劳迪娅看到比森特也百感交集。她既心疼又严厉地走到比森特身旁，对他说道：\n “如果你按照咱们的约定同我结婚，就不会落到这种地步了。”\n 受伤的比森特吃力地睁开眼睛，认出了克劳迪娅。他对克劳迪娅说道：\n “我看得很清楚，上了当的美丽姑娘呀，是你杀了我，辜负了我的一片情意，我从来没有想做对不起你的事呀。”\n “人家说你今天上午要同富豪巴尔萨斯特罗的女儿莱昂诺拉结婚，难道这不是真的？”\n “不，不是真的。”比森特说，“我真不幸，叫你得到这种消息，结果你妒火攻心，想要我的命。我能死在你的怀抱里，也算我幸运。为了向你证明我说的是实话，如果你愿意，请你握住我的手，接受我做你的丈夫。这是我能给你的最好答复，尽管你以为我伤害了你。”\n 克劳迪娅抓住了比森特的手，肝肠欲断，昏倒在比森特那冒血的胸口上。比森特也昏死过去了。罗克慌了，不知如何是好。佣人们找来凉水，喷到克劳迪娅和比森特的脸上。克劳迪娅醒了过来，可比森特却永远也不可能苏醒了。克劳迪娅哭天号地，揪下自己的头发到处乱扔，还抓自己的脸，显出一副悲痛欲绝的样子。\n “你这个狠心的糊涂女人呀，”她叫道，“你怎么会如此轻率地下了毒手呢？疯狂的嫉妒竟让你把你的心上人推上了绝路！噢，我的丈夫，你太不幸了。你本是我的亲人，却从洞房被送到了坟墓！”\n 克劳迪娅的悲痛使从来没哭过的罗克也流下了泪水。佣人们呜咽着，克劳迪娅不时地晕过去，周围成了一片悲伤和不幸的原野。后来，罗克·吉纳德吩咐佣人们把比森特的尸体送到他父亲那儿去安葬。克劳迪娅对罗克说，她想到一家修道院去，她的一个姨妈在那个修道院当院长。她要在修道院里了却余生，以上帝为她的永恒伴侣。罗克对克劳迪娅的想法表示赞同，并且愿意陪同她去她想去的任何地方。如果比森特的亲戚或者其他什么人想伤害她父亲，他都会出面保护她父亲。克劳迪娅坚持不让罗克陪送，对他的好意深表感谢，然后哭着走了。比森特的佣人们，把比森特的尸体抬走了，罗克也回到了他手下那些人身旁。这就是克劳迪娅·赫罗尼玛爱情的结局。难以按捺的嫉妒之火导致了她的这段伤心史，这又何足怪呢？\n 罗克·吉纳德看见他的随从们仍呆在自己原来的位置上，唐吉诃德也骑着马置身于他们当中，正劝说他们放弃那种无论对灵魂还是对肉体都很危险的生活方式呢。然而，那些人都是粗野放荡的加斯科尼人，根本听不进唐吉诃德的话。罗克一到，就问桑乔，他手下人从桑乔的驴那儿拿走的东西是否都已经归还了。桑乔说已经归还了，但是还缺三块价值连城的头巾。\n “你说什么？”在场的一个人说，“头巾在我这儿呢，它们也就值三个雷阿尔。”\n “是的，”唐吉诃德说，“不过我的侍从很珍视它。这是别人送给他的。”\n 罗克·吉纳德吩咐立刻把头巾还给桑乔，然后又吩咐他手下那些人一字排开，把所有衣物、珠宝和钱财都拿出来摆在自己面前。他简单估算了一下，又把那些不能分割的东西折算成钱，统一分配给大家。他分得既仔细又合理，大家都很满意。分完东西后，罗克对唐吉诃德说：\n “如果不能分配得如此公平，就无法在他们中间生存下去。”\n 桑乔说道：\n “现在我看到了，还是公平好，就是盗贼之间也需要公平。”\n 罗克的一个随从听到桑乔的话，举起火枪的枪托欲打桑乔，被罗克喝住了，否则桑乔的脑袋非得开花不可。桑乔吓坏了，决定和这群人在一起的时候再也不开口了。\n 这时，罗克的几个守在路上监视过往行人的随从跑来向罗克报告说：\n “大人，离这儿不远，在通往巴塞罗那的路上来了一大群人。”\n 罗克问道：\n “是找我们的人，还是我们要找的人？”\n “是我们要找的人。”随从答道。\n “全体出发！”罗克说道，“马上把他们都带到这儿来，不许让一个人跑掉！”\n 随从们都走了，只剩下唐吉诃德、桑乔和罗克在原地等着随从们把那些过路人抓来。这时，罗克对唐吉诃德说：\n “唐吉诃德大人一定会觉得我们这种生活很新鲜，我们所做的事情很危险。您如果这样认为，我并不感到奇怪。我承认，再没有什么生活比我们的生活更动荡不安了。我知道是受了冤屈的力量让我选择了这种生活，这是一种要扰乱所有宁静生活的力量。就我的本性来说，我是富有同情心的善良人，可是就像我刚才说的，一种要为我所受到的伤害复仇的力量压倒了我所有的善良意愿，使我身不由己地走上了这条罪恶之路，结果‘深渊与深渊响应①’，罪恶接着罪恶，我不仅为自己报仇，还负责为别人报仇。虽然我现在处在彷徨的迷宫中，可是上帝保佑我，我并没有失去从这个迷宫里安然逃脱的希望。”\n ①引自《旧约全书·诗篇》。\n 唐吉诃德听了罗克这番有理有节的议论，感到很意外，他原以为在这些偷杀抢掠的人里没有人会如此明智呢。他对罗克说道：\n “罗克大人，恢复健康的原则就是首先要了解自己的病情所在，然后按照医生的指示服药。您现在有病，而且知道病痛何在，老天或者说上帝就是我们的医生，会给您开出治病的药。不过，病常常是逐渐好的，不是突然就奇迹般地好了。聪明的病人比头脑简单的人更容易治疗。从您刚才的谈话中可以看到您很明智，现在只需您鼓起勇气，等着您意识上的疾病逐渐好转。如果您想少走弯路，尽快拯救自己，您就跟我走，我会教您如何做游侠骑士。您经历了千辛万苦，以此来赎罪，很快就可以升入天堂。”\n 罗克听了唐吉诃德的话笑了。他转了个话题，向唐吉诃德讲述了克劳迪娅·赫罗尼玛的悲剧。桑乔听了十分难过，他对这个美丽、开朗而又朝气蓬勃的姑娘已经产生了好感。\n 这时，那几个出去抓人的随从回来了，还带回两个骑马的小伙子、两个步行的朝圣者和一车妇女，车旁边有六名步行或骑马的佣人伴随，此外还有那两个骑马的小伙子带的骡夫。罗克的随从们把这些人围在中间，大家都不说话，等着罗克开口。罗克问那两个骑马的小伙子是什么人，要到哪儿去，带了多少钱。其中一人答道：\n “大人，我们是西班牙步兵的两名上尉，我们的部队现在驻扎在那不勒斯。据说在巴塞罗那有四艘船奉命要开往西西里，我们是去登船的。我们身上带了两三百个盾，我们挺知足的，当兵的平时穷惯了，不可能有很多钱。”\n 罗克向两名朝圣者问了同样的问题。朝圣者说他们要乘船去罗马，两人一共只带了六十雷阿尔。罗克又问车上坐的是什么人，想到哪儿去，一共带了多少钱。一个骑马的小伙子说道：\n “车上坐的是我的女主人，那不勒斯法庭庭长的夫人唐娜吉奥马·德基尼奥内斯，以及她的一个小女儿、一个女佣人和一个女管家。我们六个仆人就是护送她们的。我们一共带了六百个盾。”\n “既然这样，”罗克说，“咱们一共有九百个盾和六十个雷阿尔，我的兵士大概有六十人，你们算算，他们每个人可以得多少？我算术不好。”\n 他的随从们听到这话，齐声喊道：\n “罗克·吉纳德万岁，气死那些想毁掉他的混蛋们！”\n 眼看自己的钱就要被没收，两名上尉垂头丧气，庭长夫人伤心不已，朝圣者满腹牢骚。罗克等了一会儿，见他们的悲伤表情仍然那么明显，便不想让他们再伤心下去了。他转过身对两个上尉说：\n “两位上尉大人，请你们帮帮忙，借给我六十个盾；庭长夫人，请您借我八十个盾，别让和我一起来的这些人失望，就是‘修道院长也得靠唱歌吃饭’呢。然后，你们痛痛快快地赶你们的路。我给你们开个通行证，如果再碰到我手下的其他人，他们决不会伤害你们。我既不想冒犯我的兵士们，也不想冒犯任何一位妇女，特别是那些贵族妇女。”\n 两位上尉对罗克说了不少好话，对他的宽容表示感谢。唐娜吉奥马·德基尼奥内斯夫人欲下车来吻伟大罗克的手和脚，罗克坚决不允。相反，他请庭长夫人原谅自己，自己也是迫不得已，干这行的只能这样做。夫人吩咐她的仆人拿出了八十个盾，而两个上尉早已把他们该拿的六十个盾准备好了。两个朝圣者也打算倾其所有，可是罗克叫他们先等一等，转身对他的部下说：\n “这些盾你们每人拿两个，这样就还剩二十个。十个给朝圣者，十个给这位善良的侍从，别让他说咱们的坏话。”\n 罗克吩咐把随身携带的文具准备好，给他手下的几个小头目写了通行证，然后向那些人告别，让他们走了。那些人对这位慷慨大度的罗克的奇怪举动感到惊奇，觉得他不像一个臭名昭著的强盗，倒像是亚历山大大帝。有个侍从用加斯科尼和卡塔卢尼亚语说道：\n “这个头头更适合当教士，而不是当强盗。他若是想表现他的大度，以后就应该只花自己的钱，而不要花别人的钱。”\n 这个倒霉鬼说话的声音不算小。罗克伸手拔出剑，把他的脑袋几乎劈成了两半。罗克说道：\n “谁敢口吐狂言，我就这样惩罚他！”\n 大家都吓坏了，谁也不敢说话，只能唯唯诺诺。\n 罗克向旁边走出几步，给他在巴塞罗那的一个朋友写了封信，告诉那位朋友，自己如何遇到了曼查的著名的唐吉诃德，关于这位游侠骑士有很多话题可以谈，他是世界上最滑稽又最清醒的人。四天之后，也就是“施洗的约翰①日’，他会骑着他的罗西南多，与他的骑驴的侍从桑乔一起，全身披挂地出现在巴塞罗那的海滩上。罗克让朋友把这消息告诉尼亚罗②的朋友们，叫他们拿唐吉诃德开开心，但他不想让自己的对立派凯德尔也分享这份快乐。不过，这似乎又不可能，因为对于疯癫而又明智的唐吉诃德及其滑稽的侍从桑乔，大家都非常感兴趣。罗克让自己的一个随从换上农夫的衣服，把信送往巴塞罗那。\n ①这里指的是为耶稣施洗的圣约翰。\n ②尼亚罗和下面的凯德尔是西班牙的两个有名的对立强盗帮派。罗克·吉纳德是尼亚罗派的头领。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4681.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don
