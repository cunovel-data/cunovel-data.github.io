{"id":42217,"no":77,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 23","content":"It was about four in the afternoon when the sun, veiled in clouds, with subdued light and tempered beams, enabled Don Quixote to relate, without heat or inconvenience, what he had seen in the cave of Montesinos to his two illustrious hearers, and he began as follows:\\n\\n “A matter of some twelve or fourteen times a man’s height down in this pit, on the right-hand side, there is a recess or space, roomy enough to contain a large cart with its mules. A little light reaches it through some chinks or crevices, communicating with it and open to the surface of the earth. This recess or space I perceived when I was already growing weary and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspended by the rope, travelling downwards into that dark region without any certainty or knowledge of where I was going, so I resolved to enter it and rest myself for a while. I called out, telling you not to let out more rope until I bade you, but you cannot have heard me. I then gathered in the rope you were sending me, and making a coil or pile of it I seated myself upon it, ruminating and considering what I was to do to lower myself to the bottom, having no one to hold me up; and as I was thus deep in thought and perplexity, suddenly and without provocation a profound sleep fell upon me, and when I least expected it, I know not how, I awoke and found myself in the midst of the most beautiful, delightful meadow that nature could produce or the most lively human imagination conceive. I opened my eyes, I rubbed them, and found I was not asleep but thoroughly awake. Nevertheless, I felt my head and breast to satisfy myself whether it was I myself who was there or some empty delusive phantom; but touch, feeling, the collected thoughts that passed through my mind, all convinced me that I was the same then and there that I am this moment. Next there presented itself to my sight a stately royal palace or castle, with walls that seemed built of clear transparent crystal; and through two great doors that opened wide therein, I saw coming forth and advancing towards me a venerable old man, clad in a long gown of mulberry-coloured serge that trailed upon the ground. On his shoulders and breast he had a green satin collegiate hood, and covering his head a black Milanese bonnet, and his snow-white beard fell below his girdle. He carried no arms whatever, nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fair-sized filberts, each tenth bead being like a moderate ostrich egg; his bearing, his gait, his dignity and imposing presence held me spellbound and wondering. He approached me, and the first thing he did was to embrace me closely, and then he said to me, ‘For a long time now, O valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, we who are here enchanted in these solitudes have been hoping to see thee, that thou mayest make known to the world what is shut up and concealed in this deep cave, called the cave of Montesinos, which thou hast entered, an achievement reserved for thy invincible heart and stupendous courage alone to attempt. Come with me, illustrious sir, and I will show thee the marvels hidden within this transparent castle, whereof I am the alcaide and perpetual warden; for I am Montesinos himself, from whom the cave takes its name.’\\n\\n “The instant he told me he was Montesinos, I asked him if the story they told in the world above here was true, that he had taken out the heart of his great friend Durandarte from his breast with a little dagger, and carried it to the lady Belerma, as his friend when at the point of death had commanded him. He said in reply that they spoke the truth in every respect except as to the dagger, for it was not a dagger, nor little, but a burnished poniard sharper than an awl.”\\n\\n “That poniard must have been made by Ramon de Hoces the Sevillian,” said Sancho.\\n\\n “I do not know,” said Don Quixote; “it could not have been by that poniard maker, however, because Ramon de Hoces was a man of yesterday, and the affair of Roncesvalles, where this mishap occurred, was long ago; but the question is of no great importance, nor does it affect or make any alteration in the truth or substance of the story.”\\n\\n “That is true,” said the cousin; “continue, Senor Don Quixote, for I am listening to you with the greatest pleasure in the world.”\\n\\n “And with no less do I tell the tale,” said Don Quixote; “and so, to proceed — the venerable Montesinos led me into the palace of crystal, where, in a lower chamber, strangely cool and entirely of alabaster, was an elaborately wrought marble tomb, upon which I beheld, stretched at full length, a knight, not of bronze, or marble, or jasper, as are seen on other tombs, but of actual flesh and bone. His right hand (which seemed to me somewhat hairy and sinewy, a sign of great strength in its owner) lay on the side of his heart; but before I could put any question to Montesinos, he, seeing me gazing at the tomb in amazement, said to me, ‘This is my friend Durandarte, flower and mirror of the true lovers and valiant knights of his time. He is held enchanted here, as I myself and many others are, by that French enchanter Merlin, who, they say, was the devil’s son; but my belief is, not that he was the devil’s son, but that he knew, as the saying is, a point more than the devil. How or why he enchanted us, no one knows, but time will tell, and I suspect that time is not far off. What I marvel at is, that I know it to be as sure as that it is now day, that Durandarte ended his life in my arms, and that, after his death, I took out his heart with my own hands; and indeed it must have weighed more than two pounds, for, according to naturalists, he who has a large heart is more largely endowed with valour than he who has a small one. Then, as this is the case, and as the knight did really die, how comes it that he now moans and sighs from time to time, as if he were still alive?’\\n\\n \\n\\n “As he said this, the wretched Durandarte cried out in a loud voice:\\n\\n O cousin Montesinos!\\n\\n ‘T was my last request of thee,\\n\\n When my soul hath left the body,\\n\\n And that lying dead I be,\\n\\n With thy poniard or thy dagger\\n\\n Cut the heart from out my breast,\\n\\n And bear it to Belerma.\\n\\n This was my last request.\\n\\n On hearing which, the venerable Montesinos fell on his knees before the unhappy knight, and with tearful eyes exclaimed, ‘Long since, Senor Durandarte, my beloved cousin, long since have I done what you bade me on that sad day when I lost you; I took out your heart as well as I could, not leaving an atom of it in your breast, I wiped it with a lace handkerchief, and I took the road to France with it, having first laid you in the bosom of the earth with tears enough to wash and cleanse my hands of the blood that covered them after wandering among your bowels; and more by token, O cousin of my soul, at the first village I came to after leaving Roncesvalles, I sprinkled a little salt upon your heart to keep it sweet, and bring it, if not fresh, at least pickled, into the presence of the lady Belerma, whom, together with you, myself, Guadiana your squire, the duenna Ruidera and her seven daughters and two nieces, and many more of your friends and acquaintances, the sage Merlin has been keeping enchanted here these many years; and although more than five hundred have gone by, not one of us has died; Ruidera and her daughters and nieces alone are missing, and these, because of the tears they shed, Merlin, out of the compassion he seems to have felt for them, changed into so many lakes, which to this day in the world of the living, and in the province of La Mancha, are called the Lakes of Ruidera. The seven daughters belong to the kings of Spain and the two nieces to the knights of a very holy order called the Order of St. John. Guadiana your squire, likewise bewailing your fate, was changed into a river of his own name, but when he came to the surface and beheld the sun of another heaven, so great was his grief at finding he was leaving you, that he plunged into the bowels of the earth; however, as he cannot help following his natural course, he from time to time comes forth and shows himself to the sun and the world. The lakes aforesaid send him their waters, and with these, and others that come to him, he makes a grand and imposing entrance into Portugal; but for all that, go where he may, he shows his melancholy and sadness, and takes no pride in breeding dainty choice fish, only coarse and tasteless sorts, very different from those of the golden Tagus. All this that I tell you now, O cousin mine, I have told you many times before, and as you make no answer, I fear that either you believe me not, or do not hear me, whereat I feel God knows what grief. I have now news to give you, which, if it serves not to alleviate your sufferings, will not in any wise increase them. Know that you have here before you (open your eyes and you will see) that great knight of whom the sage Merlin has prophesied such great things; that Don Quixote of La Mancha I mean, who has again, and to better purpose than in past times, revived in these days knight-errantry, long since forgotten, and by whose intervention and aid it may be we shall be disenchanted; for great deeds are reserved for great men.’\\n\\n “‘And if that may not be,’ said the wretched Durandarte in a low and feeble voice, ‘if that may not be, then, my cousin, I say “patience and shuffle;\"’ and turning over on his side, he relapsed into his former silence without uttering another word.\\n\\n \\n\\n “And now there was heard a great outcry and lamentation, accompanied by deep sighs and bitter sobs. I looked round, and through the crystal wall I saw passing through another chamber a procession of two lines of fair damsels all clad in mourning, and with white turbans of Turkish fashion on their heads. Behind, in the rear of these, there came a lady, for so from her dignity she seemed to be, also clad in black, with a white veil so long and ample that it swept the ground. Her turban was twice as large as the largest of any of the others; her eyebrows met, her nose was rather flat, her mouth was large but with ruddy lips, and her teeth, of which at times she allowed a glimpse, were seen to be sparse and ill-set, though as white as peeled almonds. She carried in her hands a fine cloth, and in it, as well as I could make out, a heart that had been mummied, so parched and dried was it. Montesinos told me that all those forming the procession were the attendants of Durandarte and Belerma, who were enchanted there with their master and mistress, and that the last, she who carried the heart in the cloth, was the lady Belerma, who, with her damsels, four days in the week went in procession singing, or rather weeping, dirges over the body and miserable heart of his cousin; and that if she appeared to me somewhat ill-favoured or not so beautiful as fame reported her, it was because of the bad nights and worse days that she passed in that enchantment, as I could see by the great dark circles round her eyes, and her sickly complexion; ‘her sallowness, and the rings round her eyes,’ said he, ‘are not caused by the periodical ailment usual with women, for it is many months and even years since she has had any, but by the grief her own heart suffers because of that which she holds in her hand perpetually, and which recalls and brings back to her memory the sad fate of her lost lover; were it not for this, hardly would the great Dulcinea del Toboso, so celebrated in all these parts, and even in the world, come up to her for beauty, grace, and gaiety.’\\n\\n “‘Hold hard!’ said I at this, ‘tell your story as you ought, Senor Don Montesinos, for you know very well that all comparisons are odious, and there is no occasion to compare one person with another; the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso is what she is, and the lady Dona Belerma is what she is and has been, and that’s enough.’ To which he made answer, ‘Forgive me, Senor Don Quixote; I own I was wrong and spoke unadvisedly in saying that the lady Dulcinea could scarcely come up to the lady Belerma; for it were enough for me to have learned, by what means I know not, that youare her knight, to make me bite my tongue out before I compared her to anything save heaven itself.’ After this apology which the great Montesinos made me, my heart recovered itself from the shock I had received in hearing my lady compared with Belerma.”\\n\\n “Still I wonder,” said Sancho, “that your worship did not get upon the old fellow and bruise every bone of him with kicks, and pluck his beard until you didn’t leave a hair in it.”\\n\\n “Nay, Sancho, my friend,” said Don Quixote, “it would not have been right in me to do that, for we are all bound to pay respect to the aged, even though they be not knights, but especially to those who are, and who are enchanted; I only know I gave him as good as he brought in the many other questions and answers we exchanged.”\\n\\n “I cannot understand, Senor Don Quixote,” remarked the cousin here, “how it is that your worship, in such a short space of time as you have been below there, could have seen so many things, and said and answered so much.”\\n\\n “How long is it since I went down?” asked Don Quixote.\\n\\n “Little better than an hour,” replied Sancho.\\n\\n “That cannot be,” returned Don Quixote, “because night overtook me while I was there, and day came, and it was night again and day again three times; so that, by my reckoning, I have been three days in those remote regions beyond our ken.”\\n\\n “My master must be right,” replied Sancho; “for as everything that has happened to him is by enchantment, maybe what seems to us an hour would seem three days and nights there.”\\n\\n “That’s it,” said Don Quixote.\\n\\n “And did your worship eat anything all that time, senor?” asked the cousin.\\n\\n “I never touched a morsel,” answered Don Quixote, “nor did I feel hunger, or think of it.”\\n\\n “And do the enchanted eat?” said the cousin.\\n\\n “They neither eat,” said Don Quixote; “nor are they subject to the greater excrements, though it is thought that their nails, beards, and hair grow.”\\n\\n “And do the enchanted sleep, now, senor?” asked Sancho.\\n\\n “Certainly not,” replied Don Quixote; “at least, during those three days I was with them not one of them closed an eye, nor did I either.”\\n\\n “The proverb, ‘Tell me what company thou keepest and I’ll tell thee what thou art,’ is to the point here,” said Sancho; “your worship keeps company with enchanted people that are always fasting and watching; what wonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor sleep while you are with them? But forgive me, senor, if I say that of all this you have told us now, may God take me — I was just going to say the devil — if I believe a single particle.”\\n\\n “What!” said the cousin, “has Senor Don Quixote, then, been lying? Why, even if he wished it he has not had time to imagine and put together such a host of lies.”\\n\\n “I don’t believe my master lies,” said Sancho.\\n\\n “If not, what dost thou believe?” asked Don Quixote.\\n\\n “I believe,” replied Sancho, “that this Merlin, or those enchanters who enchanted the whole crew your worship says you saw and discoursed with down there, stuffed your imagination or your mind with all this rigmarole you have been treating us to, and all that is still to come.”\\n\\n “All that might be, Sancho,” replied Don Quixote; “but it is not so, for everything that I have told you I saw with my own eyes, and touched with my own hands. But what will you say when I tell you now how, among the countless other marvellous things Montesinos showed me (of which at leisure and at the proper time I will give thee an account in the course of our journey, for they would not be all in place here), he showed me three country girls who went skipping and capering like goats over the pleasant fields there, and the instant I beheld them I knew one to be the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, and the other two those same country girls that were with her and that we spoke to on the road from El Toboso! I asked Montesinos if he knew them, and he told me he did not, but he thought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction, for it was only a few days before that they had made their appearance in those meadows; but I was not to be surprised at that, because there were a great many other ladies there of times past and present, enchanted in various strange shapes, and among them he had recognised Queen Guinevere and her dame Quintanona, she who poured out the wine for Lancelot when he came from Britain.”\\n\\n When Sancho Panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leave of his senses, or die with laughter; for, as he knew the real truth about the pretended enchantment of Dulcinea, in which he himself had been the enchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he made up his mind at last that, beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and stark mad, so he said to him, “It was an evil hour, a worse season, and a sorrowful day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the other world, and an unlucky moment when you met with Senor Montesinos, who has sent you back to us like this. You were well enough here above in your full senses, such as God had given you, delivering maxims and giving advice at every turn, and not as you are now, talking the greatest nonsense that can be imagined.”\\n\\n “As I know thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “I heed not thy words.”\\n\\n “Nor I your worship’s ,” said Sancho, “whether you beat me or kill me for those I have spoken, and will speak if you don’t correct and mend your own. But tell me, while we are still at peace, how or by what did you recognise the lady our mistress; and if you spoke to her, what did you say, and what did she answer?”\\n\\n “I recognised her,” said Don Quixote, “by her wearing the same garments she wore when thou didst point her out to me. I spoke to her, but she did not utter a word in reply; on the contrary, she turned her back on me and took to flight, at such a pace that crossbow bolt could not have overtaken her. I wished to follow her, and would have done so had not Montesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would be useless, particularly as the time was drawing near when it would be necessary for me to quit the cavern. He told me, moreover, that in course of time he would let me know how he and Belerma, and Durandarte, and all who were there, were to be disenchanted. But of all I saw and observed down there, what gave me most pain was, that while Montesinos was speaking to me, one of the two companions of the hapless Dulcinea approached me on one without my having seen her coming, and with tears in her eyes said to me, in a low, agitated voice, ‘My lady Dulcinea del Toboso kisses your worship’s hands, and entreats you to do her the favour of letting her know how you are; and, being in great need, she also entreats your worship as earnestly as she can to be so good as to lend her half a dozen reals, or as much as you may have about you, on this new dimity petticoat that I have here; and she promises to repay them very speedily.’ I was amazed and taken aback by such a message, and turning to Senor Montesinos I asked him, ‘Is it possible, Senor Montesinos, that persons of distinction under enchantment can be in need?’ To which he replied, ‘Believe me, Senor Don Quixote, that which is called need is to be met with everywhere, and penetrates all quarters and reaches everyone, and does not spare even the enchanted; and as the lady Dulcinea del Toboso sends to beg those six reals, and the pledge is to all appearance a good one, there is nothing for it but to give them to her, for no doubt she must be in some great strait.’ ‘I will take no pledge of her,’ I replied, ‘nor yet can I give her what she asks, for all I have is four reals; which I gave (they were those which thou, Sancho, gavest me the other day to bestow in alms upon the poor I met along the road), and I said, ‘Tell your mistress, my dear, that I am grieved to the heart because of her distresses, and wish I was a Fucar to remedy them, and that I would have her know that I cannot be, and ought not be, in health while deprived of the happiness of seeing her and enjoying her discreet conversation, and that I implore her as earnestly as I can, to allow herself to be seen and addressed by this her captive servant and forlorn knight. Tell her, too, that when she least expects it she will hear it announced that I have made an oath and vow after the fashion of that which the Marquis of Mantua made to avenge his nephew Baldwin, when he found him at the point of death in the heart of the mountains, which was, not to eat bread off a tablecloth, and other trifling matters which he added, until he had avenged him; and I will make the same to take no rest, and to roam the seven regions of the earth more thoroughly than the Infante Don Pedro of Portugal ever roamed them, until I have disenchanted her.’ ‘All that and more, you owe my lady,’ the damsel’s answer to me, and taking the four reals, instead of making me a curtsey she cut a caper, springing two full yards into the air.”\\n\\n “O blessed God!” exclaimed Sancho aloud at this, “is it possible that such things can be in the world, and that enchanters and enchantments can have such power in it as to have changed my master’s right senses into a craze so full of absurdity! O senor, senor, for God’s sake, consider yourself, have a care for your honour, and give no credit to this silly stuff that has left you scant and short of wits.”\\n\\n “Thou talkest in this way because thou lovest me, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “and not being experienced in the things of the world, everything that has some difficulty about it seems to thee impossible; but time will pass, as I said before, and I will tell thee some of the things I saw down there which will make thee believe what I have related now, the truth of which admits of neither reply nor question.”\\n\\n \\n\\n 斯洞窟的见闻，离奇怪诞令人难以置信\\n\\n 下午四点钟，太阳躲进了云层，只露出一点儿微弱的光线。唐吉诃德从容不迫地向他那两位忠实的听众介绍，自己在蒙特西诺斯洞窟里见到的情况。他开始说起来：\\n\\n “从这儿下到十二人或十四人深的地方，右侧有个凹面，里面宽敞得能够容得下几头骡子和一架大骡车。透过地面上的几个缝隙或窟窿，只能射进几束微弱的光线，远远不够照明用的。我又累又烦，正当我吊在绳子上又急又恼，不知该如何向下走时，我发现了那块凹面，便决定进去休息一下。我大声喊你们，让你们等我叫你们时再放绳子，可你们大概没听见我的叫声。于是，我就把你们徐徐放下的绳子收起，盘成一团，坐在上面考虑待一会儿没人给我放绳子了，我怎么才能下到洞底。我正在胡思乱想，忽然一股极度的困意袭来，我竟不知怎么回事就睡着了。待我醒来时，发现自己竟来到了一片美妙秀丽、人类思维难以想象的风景如画的草地上。\\n\\n “我睁大了眼睛，又揉了揉眼皮，发现自己并没有睡着，确实醒着。尽管这样，我还是拍了拍自己的脑袋和胸脯，证明那确实是我自己，而不是什么虚无的幻觉，而且我的触觉、感觉和思维能力就和我现在的情况一样。接着，我的眼前出现了一座富丽堂皇的皇宫或王宫，它的墙壁似乎都是水晶的。宫殿的两扇大门打开了，我看见一位令人肃然起敬的长者向我走来。他身穿一件深紫色长袍，袍子长得拖到地上，胸前和肩膀上披着一条青缎披巾，头上戴着黑色米兰帽，长长的白胡须垂过腰间。他的手里除了一串念珠外没有任何东西。念珠的珠子比普通的胡桃还大，大珠①比鸵鸟蛋还大。那长者的气质、步伐以及庄重而又悠然自得的神态，无论是分别讲还是总体说，都使我感到惊奇。他来到我面前做的第一件事就是紧紧地拥抱我，然后对我说：‘曼查的英勇骑士唐吉诃德，我们被魔法困在这偏远的山洞里，已经恭候你多年了，希望你能够把这个蒙特西诺斯洞窟里的情况公诸于世。这样伟大的业绩只有像你这样勇敢无畏、气概非凡的人才能胜任。跟我来，尊贵的大人，我想让你看看发生在这座水晶宫里的奇事。我就是这儿的总管，将在这里终身留守。我就叫蒙特西诺斯，这个洞窟就是以我的名字命名的。’他一说他是蒙特西诺斯，我就问他，洞外世界传说他按照老朋友杜兰达尔德的吩咐，在杜兰达尔德临死之前，用一把小匕首把老朋友的心脏掏了出来，献给贝莱尔玛夫人，这事是否是真的。他说是真的，不过不是匕首，更不是小匕首，而是一种比锥子还尖的锋利短刀。”\\n\\n ①念珠每十粒小珠间有一颗大珠。\\n\\n “准是塞维利亚的拉蒙·德奥塞斯造的那种短刀。”桑乔这时候说。\\n\\n “我也不清楚，”唐吉诃德说，“但决不会是那位短刀匠造的，因为拉蒙·德奥塞斯是不久前的人物，而发生这桩悲剧的龙塞斯巴列斯年代则是在很早以前。不过，这点情况并不重要，并不影响事情的真实性和历史的连贯性。”\\n\\n “是这样。”小伙子说，“请您继续讲下去，唐吉诃德大人，我听得简直如痴如醉。”\\n\\n “我也讲得津津有味，”唐吉诃德说，“令人尊敬的长者蒙特西诺斯领我走进水晶宫，宫殿里又有个雪白的地宫，里面凉快极了，还有一座做工极其精细的大理石陵墓。我看见陵墓里躺着骑士。那骑士不像其他陵墓里的骑士那样，是青铜的、大理石的或玉的，而是有血有肉的人。他的右手放在心脏一侧，我看见他的手毛茸茸的，而且青筋暴露，看样子这位骑士很有力气。蒙特西诺斯见我看着陵墓发怔，不等我发问就对我说：‘这就是我的朋友杜兰达尔德，那个时代多情勇敢的骑士精英。他和我以及其他许多在这里的男女一样，被那个法国魔法师梅兰制服在这里。据说梅兰是魔鬼的弟子，可我觉得他不像，因为人家说他比魔鬼还强点儿呢。至于我们是怎么样以及为什么被制服在这里的，无人知晓，不过，随着时间的推移，以后肯定会知道的，我想这个日子已经为期不远了。令我惊奇的是，杜兰达尔德的的确确死在我的怀抱里，他死后我亲手把他的心脏取了出来。他的心脏大概足有两磅重。据自然科学家讲，心脏大的人要比心脏小的人勇敢。既然这位骑士确实死了，他现在怎么还能不时地唉声叹气，好像他仍然活着似的？’正说到这儿，只听杜兰达尔德大叫一声，说道：\\n\\n 蒙特西诺斯呀，我的兄弟，\\n\\n 我还有最后一件事求你，\\n\\n 那就是等我死后，\\n\\n 我的灵魂已经脱离身体，\\n\\n 请你用短刀或者匕首，\\n\\n 把我的心脏\\n\\n 从胸膛取出，\\n\\n 送到贝莱尔玛那里去。\\n\\n “令人尊敬的蒙特西诺斯听到声音，立刻跪倒在骑士面前，眼含热泪地说道：‘杜兰达尔德大人，我极其尊贵的兄弟，我已经在我们遭受重大损失的那一天按照你的吩咐做了。我尽可能小心地把你的心脏取了出来，没有在你的胸膛里留下一丝残余部分。我用花边手绢把你的心脏擦干净，带着它踏上了去法国的路程。启程之前，我挥泪如雨，掩埋了你的尸体。泪水冲洗了我的双手，冲洗了我的手在你的胸膛里沾染的鲜血。说得再具体些，我最亲爱的兄弟，在走出龙塞斯瓦列斯以后，我一到达某个有盐的地方，就往你的心脏上撒了点儿盐，以便它被送到贝莱尔玛夫人面前时，即使不是新鲜的，至少也没有变味。贝莱尔玛夫人，你，我，你的侍从瓜迪亚纳，女管家鲁伊德拉和她的七个女儿、两个外甥女，还有你的其他许多熟人和朋友，都被魔法师梅兰制服在这里已经多年了。五百年过去了，可是我们没有一个人死，只是少了鲁伊德拉以及她的女儿和外甥女们。大概是因为她们总哭哭啼啼，梅兰起了怜悯之心，就把她们变成了同样数量的小河，在人世间和曼查被称为鲁伊德拉小河。七条女儿河属于西班牙国王，两个外甥女小河则属于一个十分神圣的圣胡安骑士团。你的侍从瓜迪亚纳为你的不幸以泪洗面，最终变成了瓜迪亚纳河。这条河流到地面上，看到另一个世界的太阳，想到此时已经没有了你，心里非常难过，就又重新钻入地底。但是，它毕竟不能不顺流而走，所以又不时地露出地面，于是太阳和人们又能看到它了。贝莱尔玛的那些小河和其他许多小河都用自己的水补充它，最后浩浩荡荡地流入了葡萄牙。尽管如此，无论流到哪里，它都显得十分悲伤，不愿意用自己的水喂养珍贵的鱼类，只喂养了一些与金色塔霍河里的鱼大不相同的、味道并不鲜美的低档鱼种。我现在对你说的这些话，我的兄弟，我已经对你说过多次了，可你总是不回答，所以，我认为你是不信任我或者并没有听见我说，对此我到底是多么伤心，只有上帝知道。现在我想告诉你一点儿消息。这消息即使不能减轻你的痛苦，至少也不会给你增加任何痛苦。你知道吗，智人梅兰预言的那位能做很多事的伟大骑士，那位曼查的唐吉诃德，现在就站在你面前，你睁眼看看吧。他以比以往任何时候都辉煌的成就在当今之世重振了骑士道，他可以帮助我们解脱魔法。这样伟大的业绩只有这样伟大的人物才能完成。’‘可是如果解除不了魔法，’那位身受重创的杜兰达尔德说道，‘如果解除不了魔法，兄弟，我说呀，咱们别着急，那就洗牌吧①。’说完他就侧过身去，同以前一样默不作声了。\\n\\n ①当时输了牌的人常这样说，后引申开来，表示不甘心失败，准备从头开始。\\n\\n “这时忽然传来哭喊声，还伴着深深的叹息和痛苦的抽泣声。我回过头去，透过水晶墙看见两队极其美丽的少女从另一间大厅里依次走出。少女都穿着丧服，头上像土耳其人，一样裹着白头巾。走在队尾的是一位夫人，她那庄重的神态像是夫人。她也穿着黑色的衣服，长长的白纱一直拖到地上，裹头的白巾比其他人都大两倍。她的眉心很窄，鼻子有些塌，偶尔露出那白得像剥了皮的杏仁一样的牙齿，也是稀稀落落，参差不齐。她的手上托着一个薄麻布包，里面隐约可见一块干瘪的东西，想必就是那颗已经干了的心脏。\\n\\n “蒙特西诺斯告诉我，那队少女是杜兰达尔德和贝莱尔玛的佣人，她们同主人一起被魔法制服在这里。用细麻布托着心脏走在最后的那位夫人就是贝莱尔玛。她带领着那群少女每星期列队走四次，为杜兰达尔德的身体和心脏唱挽歌，确切地说，是哭挽歌。要说她的面目显得有些丑陋，不像传说的那么漂亮，那完全是由于魔法日夜折磨所致，这点从她的黑眼圈和憔悴的面容上就可以看出来。‘你别以为她脸色发黄、眼圈发黑与她月经不调有关，她已经有很多个月，甚至很多年没来月经了。完全是由于手里时刻捧着那颗心，她想起了她那苦命情人的不幸遭遇，自己内心悲痛，才变成了这个样子。否则，她的美貌、风度和精神几乎可以与托博索闻名遐迩的杜尔西内亚相比。’‘别说了，’我说，‘蒙特西诺斯大人，你的事你该怎么讲就怎么讲。你知道，任何比较都是可恶的，因此你不要拿某个人同其他人相比。托博索举世无双的杜尔西内亚就是杜尔西内亚，贝莱尔玛夫人就是贝莱尔玛夫人，她们该是谁就是谁，到此为止吧。’蒙特西诺斯回答说：‘唐吉诃德大人，请原谅，我承认我刚才说贝莱尔玛夫人几乎可以同杜尔西内亚夫人相比是不对的。假如我刚才意识到，我也不知道怎么就忽然意识到了，您就是杜尔西内亚夫人的骑士，我决不会拿贝莱尔玛夫人同她相比，而是拿天来同她相比了。’蒙特西诺斯这么一说我才静下心来。刚才我听他拿贝莱尔玛夫人同杜尔西内亚夫人相比，心里很不痛快。”\\n\\n “不过，更让我惊奇的是，”桑乔说，“您为什么没有骑在那个老东西身上，把他的骨头都打断，把他的胡子揪得一根不剩呢？”\\n\\n “不，桑乔朋友，”唐吉诃德说，“我如果那样做就不对了。我们大家都应该尊重老人，哪怕他们并不是骑士，尤其是要尊重那种既不是骑士又中了魔法的老人。我十分清楚，我们俩在讨论问题时应该平起平坐。”\\n\\n 小伙子这时说道：\\n\\n “这我就不明白了，唐吉诃德大人，您在下面只待了这么短的时间，怎么会看见这么多东西，说了这么多的话？”\\n\\n “我下去有多长时间？”唐吉诃德问。\\n\\n “一个多小时。”\\n\\n “不可能，”唐吉诃德说，“我在那儿天黑又天亮，天亮又天黑，一共三次。所以，按照我的计算，我在那个咱们的视线看不到、够不着的洞里一共过了三天。”\\n\\n “我的主人说的大概是真的，”桑乔说，“他遇到的那些事都是被魔法变了样的，所以我们觉得是过了一小时，可是在那边却过了三天三夜。”\\n\\n “是这样。”唐吉诃德说。\\n\\n “您在那段时间里吃东西了吗，大人？”小伙子问。\\n\\n “一口东西也没吃，”唐吉诃德说，“而且我也不饿，没感觉到饿。”\\n\\n “那些被魔法控制的人呢，也不吃东西？”小伙子问。\\n\\n “不吃东西。”唐吉诃德说，“他们也没有大便，虽然他们的指甲、胡子和头发似乎都在长。”\\n\\n “那些被魔法制服的人睡觉吗？”桑乔问。\\n\\n “不，不睡觉。”唐吉诃德说，“至少在我和他们在一起的那三天里，没有一个人合眼，我也没睡。”\\n\\n “俗话说得好，”桑乔说，“近朱者赤，近墨者黑。您和那些不吃不睡的中了魔法的人在一起，您不吃不睡也就不足为奇了。不过请您原谅，我的主人，您刚才在这里说的那些事情，我若是相信了一件，就让我见上帝去……我差点儿说成让我见鬼去了。”\\n\\n “为什么不相信呢？”小伙子问，“难道唐吉诃德大人说谎了吗？即使他想说谎，要编这么一大堆谎话，恐怕时间也来不及呀。”\\n\\n “我觉得我的主人没有说谎。”桑乔说。\\n\\n “那你觉得是怎么回事呢？”唐吉诃德问。\\n\\n “我觉得是那个梅兰，或者是对您在下面看到并且谈了话的那些人施了魔法的魔法师们，向您的想象力和记忆力灌输了那座宫殿的事情，所以您刚才才那么说，而且以后也会那么说。”\\n\\n “说来有可能，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“不过，我刚才说的那些都是我亲眼见到、亲手摸到的。蒙特西诺斯还告诉了我许许多多新奇的事情，只不过是现在没有时间讲，等咱们以后在路上我再慢慢给你说。对了，还有一件事，就是在那风景秀丽的原野上，在我眼前忽然闪现出三个农妇，像山羊似的蹦蹦跳跳。我一眼就认出其中一个就是托博索美丽无双的杜尔西内亚，另外两个是咱们在托博索出口处见到的另外两个农妇，对此你又该怎么说呢？我问蒙特西诺斯是否认识她们，蒙特西诺斯说不认识，估计是前几天刚在那儿出现的几位贵夫人，他对此并不感到惊奇，因为在那里还有其他几位前几个世纪和当今世纪的夫人，她们已经被魔法变成了不同的怪模样，其中有他认识的希内夫拉女王及其女仆金塔尼奥娜，她们正在为从布列塔尼来的兰萨罗特斟酒。”\\n\\n 桑乔听主人这么一说，就想到唐吉诃德或者是神志不正常，或者就是高兴过了头。桑乔知道所谓杜尔西内亚中了魔法的事是他一手制造的，他就是那个魔法师。现在，桑乔才完全相信他的主人神志不正常，已经全疯了。桑乔对唐吉诃德说道：\\n\\n “您真是坏时候进洞交坏运，我亲爱的主人，而且糟糕的是碰到了蒙特西诺斯大人，他让您回来变成了这个样子。你没进洞以前神志很正常，就像上帝给了您一个正常的脑袋一样，妙语横生，还不时给人以教诲。可是，现在您胡说八道得简直没边了。”\\n\\n “因为认识你，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“所以你说什么，我都不跟你计较。”\\n\\n “我也不跟您计较，”桑乔说，“哪怕您因为我刚才说的那些话打我或者杀了我。还有一些话，若不是您总纠正我，我也得说呢。咱们现在既然没吵架，那就请您告诉我，您凭什么认出那是杜尔西内亚夫人？如果您同她搭了话，都说了些什么？她又是怎样回答的？”\\n\\n “她穿的就是上次你指给我看时她穿的那身衣服。”唐吉诃德说，“我同她讲话，可她没回答，却转身跑了，快得简直如离弦之箭。我想去追她，可是蒙特西诺斯却劝我别再白费劲，而且我也该出洞了。\\n\\n “蒙特西诺斯还说以后他会告诉我，贝莱尔玛、杜兰达尔德、他自己以及那里的所有人是如何摆脱魔法的。不过，最让我伤心的是，蒙特西诺斯正同我说着话，我竟没发现是什么时候，不幸的杜尔西内亚的一位女伴已经来到我身边，眼含泪水，颤抖着声音低声对我说：‘我们的杜尔西内亚夫人吻您的手，请您告诉她您的近况；还有，她现在手头紧，请您务必借给她六个雷阿尔，或者您有多少都借给她吧。她以这条白布裙为抵押，会尽快把钱还给您。’我很惊奇，转身问蒙特西诺斯：‘蒙特西诺斯大人，中了魔法的贵人难道也会有手头紧的时候？’蒙特西诺斯答道：‘请相信我，唐吉诃德大人，这种手头紧的情况到处都有，无处不在，即使中了魔法的人也不能幸免。既然杜尔西内亚夫人派人向您借六个雷阿尔，而且抵押品也挺值钱，您就把钱给她吧，看来杜尔西内亚夫人现在确实缺钱。’‘抵押品我不要，’我说，‘而且我也不能如数给她六个雷阿尔，因为我只有四个雷阿尔。’我给了她四个雷阿尔，也就是桑乔你那天给我，准备路上万一遇到穷人乞讨时用的四个雷阿尔。我对杜尔西内亚夫人的女伴说：‘朋友，请告诉你们的夫人，我为她的窘迫从心里感到难过，真想成为富卡尔①来救济她。我还要告诉她的就是，如果我看不到她温柔的目光，听不到她睿智的谈话，我的健康就不会也不该得到保障。所以，我诚心诚意地请求夫人允许这位已被她俘虏了心的辛劳骑士能够见到她，同她说几句话。请告诉她，她也许会在某个她意想不到的时候听到我如何向她信誓旦旦，就像曼图亚侯爵在半山腰遇到他行将咽气的侄子巴尔多维诺斯时，发誓要为侄子报仇时说的那样。侯爵发誓在为侄子报仇之前要食不求精，还有其他一些事情。在为杜尔西内亚夫人解除魔法之前，我不图安逸，要游历世界八方，要比葡萄牙的唐佩德罗王子走的地方还多。’‘这些都是您应该为我们夫人做的。’那个侍女说。\\n\\n ①富卡尔是卡洛斯一世时居住在西班牙的一个德国富翁，其富裕程度当时在西班牙有口皆碑。\\n\\n “她接过了四个雷阿尔。不过她没有向我鞠躬行礼，而是向上跳了一下，跳了差不多有两米高。”\\n\\n “噢，神圣的上帝啊！”桑乔这时候大喊一声说道，“世界上真有如此魔力的魔法师和魔法，竟把我本来很精明的主人变得如此疯癫？大人啊大人，请您看在上帝份上，保重自己，保全自己的名声，不要再听信那些让您神经错乱的胡言乱语了！”\\n\\n “因为你很爱我，桑乔，你才这样对我说话。”唐吉诃德说，“因为你对世界上的事物还缺乏经验，所以稍微困难一点的事情你就以为是不可能的。就像我上次说的那样，等以后有时间的时候，我再给你讲我在下面看到的事情吧，那时你就会相信我讲的这些事都是不容置疑的。”\\n\\n \\n\\n
