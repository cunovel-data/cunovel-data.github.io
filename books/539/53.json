{"id":42193,"no":53,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 52","content":"The goatherd’s tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and the canon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked with particular attention the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the manner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit; and he observed that the curate had been quite right in saying that the woods bred men of learning. They all offered their services to Eugenio but he who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don Quixote, who said to him, “Most assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found myself in a position to attempt any adventure, I would, this very instant, set out on your behalf, and would rescue Leandra from that convent (where no doubt she is kept against her will), in spite of the abbess and all who might try to prevent me, and would place her in your hands to deal with her according to your will and pleasure, observing, however, the laws of chivalry which lay down that no violence of any kind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trust in God our Lord that the might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so great but that the power of another better disposed may prove superior to it, and then I promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do by my profession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and needy.”\n The goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote’s sorry appearance and looks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next him, “Senor, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a strain?”\n “Who should it be,” said the barber, “but the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector of damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?”\n “That,” said the goatherd, “sounds like what one reads in the books of the knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it is my belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has empty lodgings in his head.”\n “You are a great scoundrel,” said Don Quixote, “and it is you who are empty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that bore you;” and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that was near him and sent it full in the goatherd’s face, with such force that he flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand jokes, and found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying no respect to carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote, and seizing him by the throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him, had not Sancho Panza that instant come to the rescue, and grasping him by the shoulders flung him down on the table, smashing plates, breaking glasses, and upsetting and scattering everything on it. Don Quixote, finding himself free, strove to get on top of the goatherd, who, with his face covered with blood, and soundly kicked by Sancho, was on all fours feeling about for one of the table-knives to take a bloody revenge with. The canon and the curate, however, prevented him, but the barber so contrived it that he got Don Quixote under him, and rained down upon him such a shower of fisticuffs that the poor knight’s face streamed with blood as freely as his own. The canon and the curate were bursting with laughter, the officers were capering with delight, and both the one and the other hissed them on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight. Sancho alone was frantic, for he could not free himself from the grasp of one of the canon’s servants, who kept him from going to his master’s assistance.\n \n At last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers who were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a trumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction whence the sound seemed to come. But the one that was most excited by hearing it was Don Quixote, who though sorely against his will he was under the goatherd, and something more than pretty well pummelled, said to him, “Brother devil (for it is impossible but that thou must be one since thou hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine), I ask thee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me to summon me to some new adventure.” The goatherd, who was by this time tired of pummelling and being pummelled, released him at once, and Don Quixote rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents.\n The fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from the earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organising processions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands of his mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village that was hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was on one side of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange garb of the penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took it into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to him alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more confirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black they had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and discourteous thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as this occurred to him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at large, and taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he had him bridled in an instant, and calling to Sancho for his sword he mounted Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who stood by, “Now, noble company, ye shall see how important it is that there should be knights in the world professing the of knight-errantry; now, I say, ye shall see, by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is borne captive there, whether knights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,” and so saying he brought his legs to bear on Rocinante — for he had no spurs — and at a full canter (for in all this veracious history we never read of Rocinante fairly galloping) set off to encounter the penitents, though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent him. But it was out of their power, nor did he even stop for the shouts of Sancho calling after him, “Where are you going, Senor Don Quixote? What devils have possessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith? Plague take me! mind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady they are carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate Virgin. Take care what you are doing, senor, for this time it may be safely said you don’t know what you are about.” Sancho laboured in vain, for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; and even had he heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered him. He came up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was already anxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excited voice he exclaimed, “You who hide your faces, perhaps because you are not good subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say to you.” The first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and one of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck by the strange figure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the other ludicrous peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him, “Brother, if you have anything to say to us say it quickly, for these brethren are whipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it reasonable we should stop to hear anything, unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two words.”\n “I will say it in one,” replied Don Quixote, “and it is this; that at once, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, and that ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her; and I, who was born into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will not permit you to advance another step until you have restored to her the liberty she pines for and deserves.”\n From these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman, and began to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on Don Quixote’s fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush at the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that he had for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught a mighty cut Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with the portion that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of Don Quixote’s sword arm (which the buckler could not protect against the clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to the ground in a sad plight.\n Sancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeing him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again, for he was poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the days of his life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho’s shouting, but seeing that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he had killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to his heels across the country like a deer.\n By this time all Don Quixote’s companions had come up to where he lay; but the processionists seeing them come running, and with them the officers of the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief, and clustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their scourges, as the priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack, resolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against their assailants if they could. Fortune, however, arranged the matter better than they expected, for all Sancho did was to fling himself on his master’s body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable lamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead. The curate was known to another curate who walked in the procession, and their recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both parties; the first then told the other in two words who Don Quixote was, and he and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor gentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tears in his eyes, “Oh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy well-spent life! Oh pride of thy race, honour and glory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of thee will be full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds! Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since for only eight months of service thou hast given me the best island the sea girds or surrounds! Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble, encounterer of dangers, endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason, imitator of the good, scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in short, knight-errant, which is all that can be said!”\n \n At the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and the first word he said was, “He who lives separated from you, sweetest Dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friend Sancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to press the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces.”\n “That I will do with all my heart, senor,” said Sancho; “and let us return to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more profitable and creditable to us.”\n “Thou art right, Sancho,” returned Don Quixote; “It will be wise to let the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.”\n The canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely in doing as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza’s simplicities, they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road; the goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of the Brotherhood declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what was due to them; the canon begged the curate to let him know how Don Quixote did, whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it, and then begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they all separated and went their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and the barber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regarded everything with as great resignation as his master. The carter yoked his oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his usual deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end of six days they reached Don Quixote’s village, and entered it about the middle of the day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and the people were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote’s cart passed. They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they recognised their townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they saw Don Quixote coming in at the gate.\n At the news of Don Quixote’s arrival Sancho Panza’s wife came running, for she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as his squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if the ass was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master was.\n “Thanks be to God,” said she, “for being so good to me; but now tell me, my friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have you brought me back? What shoes for your children?”\n “I bring nothing of that sort, wife,” said Sancho; “though I bring other things of more consequence and value.”\n “I am very glad of that,” returned his wife; “show me these things of more value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer my heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been away.”\n “I will show them to you at home, wife,” said Sancho; “be content for the present; for if it please God that we should again go on our travels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or governor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the best that is to be had.”\n “Heaven grant it, husband,” said she, “for indeed we have need of it. But tell me, what’s this about islands, for I don’t understand it?”\n “Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,” returned Sancho; “all in good time thou shalt see, wife — nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself called ‘your ladyship’ by all thy vassals.”\n “What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and vassals?” returned Teresa Panza — for so Sancho’s wife was called, though they were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives to take their husbands’ surnames.\n “Don’t be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,” said Sancho; “it is enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I may tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world more delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a knight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those one finds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred, ninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience, for out of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still, for all that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may happen, crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting castles, putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the maravedi to pay.”\n While this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don Quixote’s housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid him in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out where he was. The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escape from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring him home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored heaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the bottomless pit. They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread lest their uncle and master should give them the slip the moment he found himself somewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out.\n But the author of this history, though he has devoted research and industry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his third sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them, at any rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely preserved in the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the third time he sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa, where he was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city, and that he had adventures there worthy of his valour and high intelligence. Of his end and death he could learn no particulars, nor would he have ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not produced an old physician for him who had in his possession a leaden box, which, according to his account, had been discovered among the crumbling foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt; in which box were found certain parchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but in Castilian verse, containing many of his achievements, and setting forth the beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of Sancho Panza, and the burial of Don Quixote himself, together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character; but all that could be read and deciphered were those which the trustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history here presents. And the said author asks of those that shall read it nothing in return for the vast toil which it has cost him in examining and searching the Manchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save that they give him the same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalry that pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he will consider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged to seek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least equal in invention and not less entertaining. The first words written on the parchment found in the leaden box were these:\n Rich spoils than Jason’s ; who a point so keen\n Had to his wit, and happier far had been\n If his wit’s weathercock a blunter bore;\n The arm renowned far as Gaeta’s shore,\n Cathay, and all the lands that lie between;\n The muse discreet and terrible in mien\n As ever wrote on brass in days of yore;\n He who surpassed the Amadises all,\n And who as naught the Galaors accounted,\n Supported by his love and gallantry:\n Who made the Belianises sing small,\n And sought renown on Rocinante mounted;\n Here, underneath this cold stone, doth he lie.\n High-bosomed, with a bearing of disdain,\n Is Dulcinea, she for whom in vain\n The great Don Quixote of La Mancha sighed.\n For her, Toboso’s queen, from side to side\n He traversed the grim sierra, the champaign\n Of Aranjuez, and Montiel’s famous plain:\n On Rocinante oft a weary ride.\n Malignant planets, cruel destiny,\n Pursued them both, the fair Manchegan dame,\n And the unconquered star of chivalry.\n Nor youth nor beauty saved her from the claim\n Of death; he paid love’s bitter penalty,\n And left the marble to preserve his name.\n Which the blood-reeking feet of Mars degrade,\n The mad Manchegan’s banner now hath been\n By him in all its bravery displayed.\n There hath he hung his arms and trenchant blade\n Wherewith, achieving deeds till now unseen,\n He slays, lays low, cleaves, hews; but art hath made\n A novel style for our new paladin.\n If Amadis be the proud boast of Gaul,\n If by his progeny the fame of Greece\n Through all the regions of the earth be spread,\n Great Quixote crowned in grim Bellona’s hall\n To-day exalts La Mancha over these,\n And above Greece or Gaul she holds her head.\n Nor ends his glory here, for his good steed\n Doth Brillador and Bayard far exceed;\n As mettled steeds compared with Rocinante,\n The reputation they have won is scanty.\n A great soul once was in that body small,\n Nor was there squire upon this earthly ball\n So plain and simple, or of guile so free.\n Within an ace of being Count was he,\n And would have been but for the spite and gall\n Of this vile age, mean and illiberal,\n That cannot even let a donkey be.\n For mounted on an ass (excuse the word),\n By Rocinante’s side this gentle squire\n Was wont his wandering master to attend.\n Delusive hopes that lure the common herd\n With promises of ease, the heart’s desire,\n In shadows, dreams, and smoke ye always end.\n Ill-errant and bruised sore,\n Whom Rocinante bore\n In his wanderings to and fro.\n By the side of the knight is laid\n Stolid man Sancho too,\n Than whom a squire more true\n Was not in the esquire trade.\n Plump was she and robust:\n Now she is ashes and dust:\n The end of all flesh that dies.\n A lady of high degree,\n With the port of a lofty dame,\n And the great Don Quixote’s flame,\n And the pride of her village was she.\n These were all the verses that could be deciphered; the rest, the writing being worm-eaten, were handed over to one of the Academicians to make out their meaning conjecturally. We have been informed that at the cost of many sleepless nights and much toil he has succeeded, and that he means to publish them in hopes of Don Quixote’s third sally.\n “Forse altro cantera con miglior plectro.”\n \n 大家对羊倌的讲述都很感兴趣，特别是牧师，他感到惊奇。虽说羊倌穿得挺破烂，可讲起话来却像个有水平的官员。看来神甫说“山里出学士”，还是说得很对的。大家都愿意为欧亨尼奥做点什么。唐吉诃德更是一马当先，他对欧亨尼奥说：\n “羊倌兄弟，如果我现在能开始一次新的征险，我肯定会立刻上路为你争取好运。不管修道院长和其他人如何阻拦，我都会把莱安德拉从修道院里救出来，因为谁也不愿意在那儿待着，然后再把她交给你，随你对她怎么样，不过你得遵守骑士规则。骑士规则规定不能对姑娘做任何她所不愿意的事情。我希望上帝别让一个恶毒魔法师的力量超过一个好心魔法师的法力。我发誓那个时候我一定会帮助你，这是我的职业要求，也就是帮助弱者和穷苦人。”\n 羊倌看了看唐吉诃德，见他蓬头垢面，十分不解。他于是问神甫：\n “大人，这个人为什么这身打扮，又这样说话，他是谁？”\n “还能是谁呢！”理发师说，“他就是曼查大名鼎鼎的唐吉诃德。他除暴安良，保护弱女，降伏巨人，而且从来都是战无不胜。”\n “这倒有点像写游侠骑士小说上的那套，”羊倌说，“他们就做您说的那些事。不过我觉得，或者是您在开玩笑，或者是这位风度翩翩的人脑袋不正常。”\n “你真是个大无赖，”唐吉诃德说，“你才脑袋不正常呢，我的脑袋比你那个婊子妈妈聪明得多。”\n 说着唐吉诃德从身边抓起一块面包，扔到羊倌的脸上。他用的劲太大了，把羊倌的鼻子都砸歪了。羊倌从来不开玩笑，见唐吉诃德竟真的动手开打，也就不顾什么地毯、台布和旁边那些正吃东西的人，向唐吉诃德扑过去，双手卡住了他的脖子。若不是桑乔这时赶来，唐吉诃德肯定被掐死。桑乔从背后抓住羊倌，把她推倒在餐布上，弄得餐布上的盘子和杯子一片狼藉。唐吉诃德脱了身，又过去骑在羊倌身上。羊倌脸上全是血，身上也被桑乔踢得很痛。他在餐布上想找把刀子报仇，可牧师和神甫制止了他。理发师乘机把羊倌从唐吉诃德身子下面拉了出来，羊倌挥拳向唐吉诃德的脸猛击，结果唐吉诃德也同羊倌一样血流满面。牧师和神甫看得笑破了肚子，几个团丁也看得兴高采烈，还在一边起哄，仿佛在看两只狗咬架。只有桑乔急得不得了，他被牧师的一个佣人抓住脱不开身，不能去帮助他的主人。\n 总之，打架的人打得热火朝天，看热闹的人看得心花怒放。这时传来一阵忧伤的喇叭声，大家不由得向传来喇叭声的方向转过脸去。最激动的还是唐吉诃德，但他现在正被羊倌压在身下，由不得自己，而且他身上也疼得够呛，于是对羊倌说：\n “魔鬼兄弟，你能不能别这样？你的意志和力量制服我了。我请求你暂且休战一小时，那个痛苦的喇叭声似乎正呼唤我进行一次新的征险。”\n 羊倌也懒得再打下去了，便放开了唐吉诃德。唐吉诃德站起来，转头向传来喇叭声的方向望去，忽然看见从一个山坡上走来了很多穿白色衣服的人，看样子像是鞭打自己以赎罪的教徒。\n 原来那一年天上一直没下雨，于是那一带各个地方的人都结队游行，有的祈祷，有的苦行，请求上帝开恩下点儿雨。那些结队而行的人就是附近一个村庄的人，到山坡上一个圣庵去求雨的。唐吉诃德见那些人穿着稀奇古怪的笞刑衣服，竟忘了这是他司空见惯的事情，以为这是要由他这位游侠骑士来完成的征险之事。他再一想，那些人所抬的穿丧服的偶像就是被一些居心叵测的歹徒劫持的贵夫人，便更以为是这么回事了。想到此，他敏捷地冲向正在溜达着吃草的罗西南多，从鞍架上取下皮盾和马嚼子，迅速给马套上嚼子，又让桑乔把剑递给他，翻身上了罗西南多，手持皮盾，高声向所有在场的人说道：\n “各位勇士们，现在你们马上就会看到世界是多么需要游侠骑士。你们一旦看到那位被囚禁的善良夫人获得了自由，就会知道游侠骑士的重要性了。”\n 说完唐吉诃德就催马向前，他脚上没有马刺，就用双腿夹紧马肚子，于是罗西南多以它在这个故事里从未有过的速度向前飞奔，直接冲向那些苦行赎罪的教徒。神甫、牧师和理发师想拉住唐吉诃德已经不可能了，桑乔大声喊叫更是无济于事。桑乔喊道：\n “你往哪儿去呀，唐吉诃德大人？你见了什么鬼，竟反对起咱们天主教的事儿来了？真糟糕，那是结队行进的苦行教徒！他们抬的那位夫人是圣洁无比的圣母像！你看看，你在干什么呀，大人，这回你可是做了不应该做的事！”\n 桑乔完全是徒劳一场。唐吉诃德飞速冲向那些穿白衣服的人，要解救穿丧服的夫人，根本没听到别人说什么；即使听到了，他也不会回头，无论谁叫他，他都不会回头。他冲到队伍前，勒住了罗西南多，罗西南多也想歇歇了。唐吉诃德声音嘶哑地说道：\n “你们这些人蒙着脸，想必不是好人。现在你们注意听我说。”\n 抬神像的几个人首先停住了。四个诵经的教士中有一个见唐吉诃德这副打扮，再看看瘦骨嶙峋的罗西南多，还有唐吉诃德的其他许多可笑之处，就说道：\n “老兄啊，你如果想说什么，就赶紧说吧。你看我们这些兄弟已经皮开肉绽了，如果你不赶紧说，那么，我们既不能也没有道理在这儿听人讲什么事情的。”\n “我说得非常简单，”唐吉诃德说，“那就是你们立刻把这位夫人放了。她的泪水愁容非常明确地表明，她是被你们强迫带走的，你们也一定冒犯了她。我来到这个世界上就是要铲除这种罪恶。你们如果不让她获得应有的自由，就休想向前一步。”\n 大家一听唐吉诃德这话就知道这人准是个疯子，不禁大笑起来。这一笑简直是给唐吉诃德火上浇油。他二话不说，举起剑向抬架冲去。一个抬架子的人放下架子，举着一个休息时用来支撑抬架的桠叉迎住了唐吉诃德。唐吉诃德一剑劈来，叉形架被劈成两半。抬架人举起手中剩下的那截，打中了唐吉诃德挥剑一侧的肩膀。唐吉诃德的皮盾抵挡不住抬架人的蛮劲，可怜的唐吉诃德被打翻落马。桑乔气喘吁吁地赶过来，见唐吉诃德已经躺倒在地，就大声地喊叫抬架人不要再打了，说他是个中了魔法的可怜骑士，从来没有伤害过任何人。抬架人倒是不打了，不过并不是由于桑乔的喊叫才住手的，而是因为他看见唐吉诃德已经手脚冰凉，以为他死了，于是把长袍往腰间一掖，逃之夭夭。\n 这时与唐吉诃德同行的那些人全赶来了。这些教徒见跑来这么多人，还有手持弓弩的团丁，唯恐发生什么不测，立刻围在神像周围。他们摘掉头上的尖纸帽，准备迎战。教士们也抄起了高烛台，准备自卫，如果可能的话，还可以向对方进攻。不过，事情并没有人们想象的那么糟糕。桑乔以为唐吉诃德已经死了，扑在他身上大哭起来，可别人却觉得挺好笑。\n 神甫同那行人中的另一位神甫是熟人，这一下双方的恐惧消除了。这位神甫向那位神甫简单介绍了唐吉诃德的情况，于是那位神甫和那些鞭笞教徒都过去察看可怜的骑士是否已经死了。只听桑乔痛哭流涕地喊道：\n “哎呀，骑士的精英，你竟因为这一棍子英年早逝！你是你们家族的光荣，是整个曼查乃至整个世界的骄傲！没有了你，世上的歹徒就会肆无忌惮地到处作恶！你比所有的亚历山大还慷慨，我仅服侍你八个月，你就把海里最好的岛屿赠给了我！你谦恭对昂首，昂首对谦恭①，你迎战艰险，忍辱负重，一往情深，你仿善惩恶，扫除丑行，反正你尽了游侠骑士之所能！”\n ①桑乔在痛苦之中把后半句说颠倒了。\n 桑乔连哭带叫，把唐吉诃德终于喊醒了，他醒来以后的第一句话就是：\n “最最温情的杜尔西内亚，与你分离的痛苦远远大于现在这些痛苦。桑乔朋友，帮帮忙，让我坐到那辆中了魔法的车上去。我这边的肩膀已经被打坏，不能骑罗西南多了。”\n “我非常愿意，”桑乔说，“咱们现在回老家去，这几位大人也愿意与咱们相伴。回去以后，咱们再重振旗鼓，搞一次有利可图的、更能出名的出征。”\n “你说得对，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“先等这股晦气过去再行动，才是明智之举。”\n 牧师、神甫和理发师对唐吉诃德说，就按照他自己说的去做，这样做很对。他们对桑乔竟如此头脑简单也感到庆幸。大家把唐吉诃德按照原来的样子放在牛车上，收拾妥当，继续赶路。羊倌同大家告别，团丁也不想再往前走，于是神甫按照约定给了他们一些钱。牧师请求神甫以后把唐吉诃德的情况告诉他，看唐吉诃德的疯病究竟是治好了还是依然如故。说完这些，牧师才吩咐他的佣人们启程。大家高高兴兴地各走各的路，只剩下神甫、理发师、唐吉诃德和桑乔，还有温顺的罗西南多，它同主人一样，一直极其耐心地看着眼前的一切。\n 牛车的主人套上牛，又往唐吉诃德身下加了一捆干草，然后才按照神甫的指点，慢吞吞地上了路。六天之后，他们回到了唐吉诃德的故乡。他们到达村庄时正是大白天，又赶上是星期日，人们都聚集在村里的空场上，送唐吉诃德的牛车就从空场中间通过。大家都过来看车上装的是什么东西，待他们认出车上装的竟是自己的同村老乡时，都非常惊讶。有个男孩子飞快地跑去把消息告诉了唐吉诃德的女管家和外甥女，说唐吉诃德面黄肌瘦地躺在一辆牛车的一堆干草上回来了。两个善良女人的喊声听起来真让人怜悯。她们打自己的嘴巴，又诅咒那些可恶的骑士小说，待唐吉诃德被送进家门时，她们的这些声音更加强烈了。\n 桑乔的妻子听到唐吉诃德回来的消息也赶来了。她已经听说桑乔给唐吉诃德做了侍从。一见到桑乔，她首先打听的就是那头驴的情况是否还好。桑乔说比自己的主人还好。\n “感谢上帝，”桑乔的妻子说，“能如此照顾我。不过，你现在告诉我，朋友，你当侍从得到什么好处了？给我带前开口的女裙①了吗？给孩子们带鞋了吗？”\n ①16世纪时的一种贵重的裙子。\n “这些都没有，”桑乔说，“我的老伴儿，不过我带回了更有用、更贵重的东西。”\n “那我当然高兴，”妻子说，“让我看看那些更贵重、更有用的东西是什么，朋友。我想看看，也让我的心高兴高兴。你不在家这段时间里，我的心一直很难过。”\n “等到家我再给你看，老伴儿，”桑乔说，“现在你就放心吧。若是上帝保佑，我们能再次出去征险，我很快就会成为伯爵或某个岛屿的总督，而且不是一般的岛屿，是世界上最好的岛屿。”\n “但愿老天能够保佑我们，我的丈夫，咱们正需要这个呢。\n 不过你告诉我，什么叫岛屿？我不明白。”\n “真是驴嘴不知蜜甜，”桑乔说，“到时候你就知道了，娘子，待你听到你的臣民称呼你为女领主时，你就更感到新鲜了。”\n “你说的女领主、岛屿和臣民到底是什么东西，桑乔？”胡安娜·潘萨问。人们都叫她胡安娜·潘萨。虽然他们并不是一个家族的，但是在曼查，女人们都习惯使用丈夫的姓。\n “你别急着一下子什么都知道，胡安娜。我告诉你实情，你闭着嘴听就行了。我只想告诉你，世界上再没有比为四处征险的游侠骑士当光荣的侍从更美的事情了。不过人不能处处遂愿，这也是事实，一百次征险里，往往有九十九次不能成功。我对此深有体会。我曾被人用被单扔过，被人打过。尽管如此，能够翻越高山，搜索树林，攀登岩石，访问城堡，随意留宿客店，分文都不用付，的确也是件很美的事情。”\n 桑乔和胡安娜说话的时候，唐吉诃德的女管家和外甥女把唐吉诃德迎进屋里，给他脱掉了衣服，让他在他原来那张旧床上躺下。唐吉诃德斜眼看着他们，到底还是没明白自己到了什么地方。神甫嘱咐唐吉诃德的外甥女好好照顾她的舅舅，让她们注意可别让唐吉诃德再跑了，又讲了这回费了多少事才把唐吉诃德弄回来。两个女人听了又喊声震天，诅咒骑士小说。她们还请求老天把那些胡编乱造的作者们都扔到深渊的最深处去。最后，她们又担心她们的主人和舅舅待身体稍微有所恢复就又会跑掉。不幸，她们言中了。\n 尽管这个故事的作者千方百计搜寻有关唐吉诃德第三次出征的材料，却一无所获，至少没有找到真正的文字材料。不过，据曼查的人们记忆，唐吉诃德第三次出征到的是萨拉戈萨，参加了当地几场很有影响的比武，充分显示了他的勇气和智慧。至于他最后的结局，幸亏有一位老医生的铅盒子，否则人们就无从了解了。据那位老医生说，那个铅盒子是他在一个被翻修的寺院墙基下发现的。铅盒里有一些用哥特体的字写的手稿，不过诗文都是用西班牙文写的，里面介绍了唐吉诃德的许多事迹，描绘了杜尔西内亚的美貌、罗西南多的形象、桑乔的忠诚和唐吉诃德本人的坟墓，还记载了一些墓志铭和歌颂唐吉诃德生活习惯的文字。这个新奇故事的作者已经将其中能够看得清的记录于此。作者并没有要求读者称赞他不辞辛苦，查找了曼查的所有档案，然后把这个故事公诸于众，只是希望读者能够像相信那些风靡于世的骑士小说一样相信他。如果能够这样，他就满足了，而且还会去寻找新的故事，即使不像这个故事一样真实，也会像这个故事一样使人开心消遣。\n 铅盒里的羊皮纸上记载的首先是下面这些内容：\n 曼查的阿加马西利亚城诸院士\n 在此撰文感怀唐吉诃德生平\n 阿加马西利亚城的狂人院士\n 为唐吉诃德题墓志铭\n 这位疯癫之人为曼查带来了\n 比克里特的伊阿宋①还要多的功利。\n 他的神志变化无常，\n 似风标望之莫及。\n 他的臂膀力及八方\n 从卡塔依到盖亚②之地。\n 可怕而又新颖的灵感\n 将他的诗刻到了青铜板上。\n 他沉湎于他的爱情和怪诞，\n 阿马迪斯为之逊色，\n 加劳尔无法与之比拟。\n 他曾骑着罗西南多游四方，\n 贝利亚尼斯为之哑然，\n 如今，他却在这冰冷的石碑下安息。\n 阿加马西利亚城的受宠院士\n 赞颂托博索的杜尔西内亚\n 十四行诗\n ①克里特是地中海中的一个岛屿，属于希腊。希腊神话中的伊阿宋曾率领阿尔戈英雄去那里觅取金羊毛。\n ②盖亚是希腊神话中的地神，大地的化身。\n 浓眉硕眼，脸庞宽大\n 隆起的胸脯，举止潇洒，\n 这就是唐吉诃德一往情深的\n 托博索王后杜尔西内亚。\n 翻越内格罗山，\n 跋涉著名的蒙铁尔原野，\n 以及阿兰胡埃斯的沃草平原，\n 步履维艰皆为她。\n 责任在罗西南多，命运不济，\n 曼查的姑娘，无往不胜的\n 游侠骑士啊，已痛失年华。\n 她已玉殒香消，\n 他的名字虽刻在大理石上，\n 却未能摆脱爱情、愤怒和欺诈。\n 阿加马西利亚城才气极佳的古怪院士\n 赞颂唐吉诃德的坐骑罗西南多\n 十七行诗\n 乘坐威武坚实的宝座，\n 铁蹄带着腥风血雨。\n 曼查狂人挥舞着他的旗帜，\n 征险何奇特！\n 披挂着甲胄和利剑，\n 挥砍刺杀，荡涤污浊。\n 业绩辉煌，一代新风，\n 勇士战功真显赫。\n 高卢为阿马迪斯自豪，\n 希腊勇敢的子孙\n 已超过千倍，名传山河。\n 柏洛娜①在王宫为唐吉诃德加冕，\n 曼查为之骄傲，\n 胜过希腊和高卢。\n 他的功名不可湮没，\n 他英俊的罗西南多\n 亦胜过布里亚多罗和巴亚尔多②。\n 阿加马西利亚城的嘲弄院士\n 吊桑乔·潘萨\n 十四行诗\n 五短身材，桑乔·潘萨，\n 勇气过人，众人惊讶。\n 我发誓担保，世界上\n 最纯朴诚实的侍从就是他。\n 他几乎得到伯爵位，\n 可惜时代太褊狭，\n 连一头驴都不放过，\n 恶毒攻击加咒骂。\n 顺从的侍从骑着驴（恕我用词不雅），\n 追随顺从的罗西南多，\n 追随骑士游侠。\n 人世的愿望皆落空，\n 许诺的是安逸，\n 得到的却是阴影、尘烟和梦花！\n 阿加马西利亚城的见鬼院士\n 为唐吉诃德题墓志铭\n 这里长眠的骑士\n 曾倍受痛楚，命运不佳。\n 他的罗西南多\n 驮着他浪迹天涯。\n 愚蠢的桑乔·潘萨\n 与他同眠于此，\n 侍从比比皆是，\n 唯他忠诚无华。\n 阿加马西利亚城的丧钟院士\n 为杜尔西内亚题墓志铭\n 这里安息着杜尔西内亚，\n 尽管她体态丰盈，\n 狰狞可怕的死亡\n 已使她肉销骨枯埋地下。\n 她血统纯正，\n 气度风雅\n 她燃烧着唐吉诃德的心，\n 使家乡誉满天下。\n ①柏洛娜是罗马战神马尔斯之妻。\n ②布里亚多罗和巴亚尔多是传说中出名的战马。\n 这些就是能够看得清的几首，其它的已经被虫蛀得模糊不清，全都委托给一位院士去猜测辨认了。据说他挑灯夜战，已经大功告成，准备连同唐吉诃德的第三次出征记一起出版。\n 也许别人会唱得更好，\n 《唐吉诃德》上卷至此结束。\n \n
