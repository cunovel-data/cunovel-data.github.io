{"id":42211,"no":71,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 17","content":"The history tells that when Don Quixote called out to Sancho to bring him his helmet, Sancho was buying some curds the shepherds agreed to sell him, and flurried by the great haste his master was in did not know what to do with them or what to carry them in; so, not to lose them, for he had already paid for them, he thought it best to throw them into his master’s helmet, and acting on this bright idea he went to see what his master wanted with him. He, as he approached, exclaimed to him:\n “Give me that helmet, my friend, for either I know little of adventures, or what I observe yonder is one that will, and does, call upon me to arm myself.”\n He of the green gaban, on hearing this, looked in all directions, but could perceive nothing, except a cart coming towards them with two or three small flags, which led him to conclude it must be carrying treasure of the King’s , and he said so to Don Quixote. He, however, would not believe him, being always persuaded and convinced that all that happened to him must be adventures and still more adventures; so he replied to the gentleman, “He who is prepared has his battle half fought; nothing is lost by my preparing myself, for I know by experience that I have enemies, visible and invisible, and I know not when, or where, or at what moment, or in what shapes they will attack me;” and turning to Sancho he called for his helmet; and Sancho, as he had no time to take out the curds, had to give it just as it was. Don Quixote took it, and without perceiving what was in it thrust it down in hot haste upon his head; but as the curds were pressed and squeezed the whey began to run all over his face and beard, whereat he was so startled that he cried out to Sancho:\n “Sancho, what’s this? I think my head is softening, or my brains are melting, or I am sweating from head to foot! If I am sweating it is not indeed from fear. I am convinced beyond a doubt that the adventure which is about to befall me is a terrible one. Give me something to wipe myself with, if thou hast it, for this profuse sweat is blinding me.”\n Sancho held his tongue, and gave him a cloth, and gave thanks to God at the same time that his master had not found out what was the matter. Don Quixote then wiped himself, and took off his helmet to see what it was that made his head feel so cool, and seeing all that white mash inside his helmet he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelt it he exclaimed:\n “By the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but it is curds thou hast put here, thou treacherous, impudent, ill-mannered squire!”\n To which, with great composure and pretended innocence, Sancho replied, “If they are curds let me have them, your worship, and I’ll eat them; but let the devil eat them, for it must have been he who put them there. I dare to dirty your helmet! You have guessed the offender finely! Faith, sir, by the light God gives me, it seems I must have enchanters too, that persecute me as a creature and limb of your worship, and they must have put that nastiness there in order to provoke your patience to anger, and make you baste my ribs as you are wont to do. Well, this time, indeed, they have missed their aim, for I trust to my master’s good sense to see that I have got no curds or milk, or anything of the sort; and that if I had it is in my stomach I would put it and not in the helmet.”\n “May he so,” said Don Quixote. All this the gentleman was observing, and with astonishment, more especially when, after having wiped himself clean, his head, face, beard, and helmet, Don Quixote put it on, and settling himself firmly in his stirrups, easing his sword in the scabbard, and grasping his lance, he cried, “Now, come who will, here am I, ready to try conclusions with Satan himself in person!”\n By this time the cart with the flags had come up, unattended by anyone except the carter on a mule, and a man sitting in front. Don Quixote planted himself before it and said, “Whither are you going, brothers? What cart is this? What have you got in it? What flags are those?”\n To this the carter replied, “The cart is mine; what is in it is a pair of wild caged lions, which the governor of Oran is sending to court as a present to his Majesty; and the flags are our lord the King’s , to show that what is here is his property.”\n “And are the lions large?” asked Don Quixote.\n “So large,” replied the man who sat at the door of the cart, “that larger, or as large, have never crossed from Africa to Spain; I am the keeper, and I have brought over others, but never any like these. They are male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female in the one behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothing to-day, so let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to the place where we are to feed them.”\n Hereupon, smiling slightly, Don Quixote exclaimed, “Lion-whelps to me! to me whelps of lions, and at such a time! Then, by God! those gentlemen who send them here shall see if I am a man to be frightened by lions. Get down, my good fellow, and as you are the keeper open the cages, and turn me out those beasts, and in the midst of this plain I will let them know who Don Quixote of La Mancha is, in spite and in the teeth of the enchanters who send them to me.”\n “So, so,” said the gentleman to himself at this; “our worthy knight has shown of what sort he is; the curds, no doubt, have softened his skull and brought his brains to a head.”\n At this instant Sancho came up to him, saying, “Senor, for God’s sake do something to keep my master, Don Quixote, from tackling these lions; for if he does they’ll tear us all to pieces here.”\n “Is your master then so mad,” asked the gentleman, “that you believe and are afraid he will engage such fierce animals?”\n “He is not mad,” said Sancho, “but he is venturesome.”\n “I will prevent it,” said the gentleman; and going over to Don Quixote, who was insisting upon the keeper’s opening the cages, he said to him, “Sir knight, knights-errant should attempt adventures which encourage the hope of a successful issue, not those which entirely withhold it; for valour that trenches upon temerity savours rather of madness than of courage; moreover, these lions do not come to oppose you, nor do they dream of such a thing; they are going as presents to his Majesty, and it will not be right to stop them or delay their journey.”\n “Gentle sir,” replied Don Quixote, “you go and mind your tame partridge and your bold ferret, and leave everyone to manage his own business; this is mine, and I know whether these gentlemen the lions come to me or not;” and then turning to the keeper he exclaimed, “By all that’s good, sir scoundrel, if you don’t open the cages this very instant, I’ll pin you to the cart with this lance.”\n The carter, seeing the determination of this apparition in armour, said to him, “Please your worship, for charity’s sake, senor, let me unyoke the mules and place myself in safety along with them before the lions are turned out; for if they kill them on me I am ruined for life, for all I possess is this cart and mules.”\n “O man of little faith,” replied Don Quixote, “get down and unyoke; you will soon see that you are exerting yourself for nothing, and that you might have spared yourself the trouble.”\n The carter got down and with all speed unyoked the mules, and the keeper called out at the top of his voice, “I call all here to witness that against my will and under compulsion I open the cages and let the lions loose, and that I warn this gentleman that he will be accountable for all the harm and mischief which these beasts may do, and for my salary and dues as well. You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety before I open, for I know they will do me no harm.”\n Once more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such a mad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly. To this, Don Quixote replied that he knew what he was about. The gentleman in return entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was under a delusion.\n “Well, senor,” answered Don Quixote, “if you do not like to be a spectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur your flea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.”\n Hearing this, Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up an enterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful one of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attempted in the whole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. “Look ye, senor,” said Sancho, “there’s no enchantment here, nor anything of the sort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I have seen the paw of a real lion, and judging by that I reckon the lion such a paw could belong to must be bigger than a mountain.”\n “Fear at any rate,” replied Don Quixote, “will make him look bigger to thee than half the world. Retire, Sancho, and leave me; and if I die here thou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to Dulcinea — I say no more.” To these he added some further words that banished all hope of his giving up his insane project. He of the green gaban would have offered resistance, but he found himself ill-matched as to arms, and did not think it prudent to come to blows with a madman, for such Don Quixote now showed himself to be in every respect; and the latter, renewing his commands to the keeper and repeating his threats, gave warning to the gentleman to spur his mare, Sancho his Dapple, and the carter his mules, all striving to get away from the cart as far as they could before the lions broke loose. Sancho was weeping over his master’s death, for this time he firmly believed it was in store for him from the claws of the lions; and he cursed his fate and called it an unlucky hour when he thought of taking service with him again; but with all his tears and lamentations he did not forget to thrash Dapple so as to put a good space between himself and the cart. The keeper, seeing that the fugitives were now some distance off, once more entreated and warned him as before; but he replied that he heard him, and that he need not trouble himself with any further warnings or entreaties, as they would be fruitless, and bade him make haste.\n During the delay that occurred while the keeper was opening the first cage, Don Quixote was considering whether it would not be well to do battle on foot, instead of on horseback, and finally resolved to fight on foot, fearing that Rocinante might take fright at the sight of the lions; he therefore sprang off his horse, flung his lance aside, braced his buckler on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced slowly with marvellous intrepidity and resolute courage, to plant himself in front of the cart, commending himself with all his heart to God and to his lady Dulcinea.\n It is to be observed, that on coming to this passage, the author of this veracious history breaks out into exclamations. “O doughty Don Quixote! high-mettled past extolling! Mirror, wherein all the heroes of the world may see themselves! Second modern Don Manuel de Leon, once the glory and honour of Spanish knighthood! In what words shall I describe this dread exploit, by what language shall I make it credible to ages to come, what eulogies are there unmeet for thee, though they be hyperboles piled on hyperboles! On foot, alone, undaunted, high-souled, with but a simple sword, and that no trenchant blade of the Perrillo brand, a shield, but no bright polished steel one, there stoodst thou, biding and awaiting the two fiercest lions that Africa’s forests ever bred! Thy own deeds be thy praise, valiant Manchegan, and here I leave them as they stand, wanting the words wherewith to glorify them!”\n \n Here the author’s outburst came to an end, and he proceeded to take up the thread of his story, saying that the keeper, seeing that Don Quixote had taken up his position, and that it was impossible for him to avoid letting out the male without incurring the enmity of the fiery and daring knight, flung open the doors of the first cage, containing, as has been said, the lion, which was now seen to be of enormous size, and grim and hideous mien. The first thing he did was to turn round in the cage in which he lay, and protrude his claws, and stretch himself thoroughly; he next opened his mouth, and yawned very leisurely, and with near two palms’ length of tongue that he had thrust forth, he licked the dust out of his eyes and washed his face; having done this, he put his head out of the cage and looked all round with eyes like glowing coals, a spectacle and demeanour to strike terror into temerity itself. Don Quixote merely observed him steadily, longing for him to leap from the cart and come to close quarters with him, when he hoped to hew him in pieces.\n So far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more courteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado, after having looked all round, as has been said, turned about and presented his hind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and tranquilly lay down again in the cage. Seeing this, Don Quixote ordered the keeper to take a stick to him and provoke him to make him come out.\n “That I won’t,” said the keeper; “for if I anger him, the first he’ll tear in pieces will be myself. Be satisfied, sir knight, with what you have done, which leaves nothing more to be said on the score of courage, and do not seek to tempt fortune a second time. The lion has the door open; he is free to come out or not to come out; but as he has not come out so far, he will not come out to-day. Your worship’s great courage has been fully manifested already; no brave champion, so it strikes me, is bound to do more than challenge his enemy and wait for him on the field; if his adversary does not come, on him lies the disgrace, and he who waits for him carries off the crown of victory.”\n “That is true,” said Don Quixote; “close the door, my friend, and let me have, in the best form thou canst, what thou hast seen me do, by way of certificate; to wit, that thou didst open for the lion, that I waited for him, that he did not come out, that I still waited for him, and that still he did not come out, and lay down again. I am not bound to do more; enchantments avaunt, and God uphold the right, the truth, and true chivalry! Close the door as I bade thee, while I make signals to the fugitives that have left us, that they may learn this exploit from thy lips.”\n The keeper obeyed, and Don Quixote, fixing on the point of his lance the cloth he had wiped his face with after the deluge of curds, proceeded to recall the others, who still continued to fly, looking back at every step, all in a body, the gentleman bringing up the rear. Sancho, however, happening to observe the signal of the white cloth, exclaimed, “May I die, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts, for he is calling to us.”\n They all stopped, and perceived that it was Don Quixote who was making signals, and shaking off their fears to some extent, they approached slowly until they were near enough to hear distinctly Don Quixote’s voice calling to them. They returned at length to the cart, and as they came up, Don Quixote said to the carter, “Put your mules to once more, brother, and continue your journey; and do thou, Sancho, give him two gold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delay they have incurred through me.”\n “That will I give with all my heart,” said Sancho; “but what has become of the lions? Are they dead or alive?”\n The keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end of the contest, exalting to the best of his power and ability the valour of Don Quixote, at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would not and dared not come out of the cage, although he had held the door open ever so long; and showing how, in consequence of his having represented to the knight that it was tempting God to provoke the lion in order to force him out, which he wished to have done, he very reluctantly, and altogether against his will, had allowed the door to be closed.\n “What dost thou think of this, Sancho?” said Don Quixote. “Are there any enchantments that can prevail against true valour? The enchanters may be able to rob me of good fortune, but of fortitude and courage they cannot.”\n Sancho paid the crowns, the carter put to, the keeper kissed Don Quixote’s hands for the bounty bestowed upon him, and promised to give an account of the valiant exploit to the King himself, as soon as he saw him at court.\n “Then,” said Don Quixote, “if his Majesty should happen to ask who performed it, you must say The KNIGHT OF THE LIONS; for it is my desire that into this the name I have hitherto borne of Knight of the Rueful Countenance be from this time forward changed, altered, transformed, and turned; and in this I follow the ancient usage of knights-errant, who changed their names when they pleased, or when it suited their purpose.”\n The cart went its way, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and he of the green gaban went theirs. All this time, Don Diego de Miranda had not spoken a word, being entirely taken up with observing and noting all that Don Quixote did and said, and the opinion he formed was that he was a man of brains gone mad, and a madman on the verge of rationality. The first part of his history had not yet reached him, for, had he read it, the amazement with which his words and deeds filled him would have vanished, as he would then have understood the nature of his madness; but knowing nothing of it, he took him to be rational one moment, and crazy the next, for what he said was sensible, elegant, and well expressed, and what he did, absurd, rash, and foolish; and said he to himself, “What could be madder than putting on a helmet full of curds, and then persuading oneself that enchanters are softening one’s skull; or what could be greater rashness and folly than wanting to fight lions tooth and nail?”\n Don Quixote roused him from these reflections and this soliloquy by saying, “No doubt, Senor Don Diego de Miranda, you set me down in your mind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did, for my deeds do not argue anything else. But for all that, I would have you take notice that I am neither so mad nor so foolish as I must have seemed to you. A gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his lance to bear adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his sovereign, in the midst of a spacious plaza; a knight shows to advantage arrayed in glittering armour, pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyous tournament, and all those knights show to advantage that entertain, divert, and, if we may say so, honour the courts of their princes by warlike exercises, or what resemble them; but to greater advantage than all these does a knight-errant show when he traverses deserts, solitudes, cross-roads, forests, and mountains, in quest of perilous adventures, bent on bringing them to a happy and successful issue, all to win a glorious and lasting renown. To greater advantage, I maintain, does the knight-errant show bringing aid to some widow in some lonely waste, than the court knight dallying with some city damsel. All knights have their own special parts to play; let the courtier devote himself to the ladies, let him add lustre to his sovereign’s court by his liveries, let him entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fare of his table, let him arrange joustings, marshal tournaments, and prove himself noble, generous, and magnificent, and above all a good Christian, and so doing he will fulfil the duties that are especially his; but let the knight-errant explore the corners of the earth and penetrate the most intricate labyrinths, at each step let him attempt impossibilities, on desolate heaths let him endure the burning rays of the midsummer sun, and the bitter inclemency of the winter winds and frosts; let no lions daunt him, no monsters terrify him, no dragons make him quail; for to seek these, to attack those, and to vanquish all, are in truth his main duties. I, then, as it has fallen to my lot to be a member of knight-errantry, cannot avoid attempting all that to me seems to come within the sphere of my duties; thus it was my bounden duty to attack those lions that I just now attacked, although I knew it to be the height of rashness; for I know well what valour is, that it is a virtue that occupies a place between two vicious extremes, cowardice and temerity; but it will be a lesser evil for him who is valiant to rise till he reaches the point of rashness, than to sink until he reaches the point of cowardice; for, as it is easier for the prodigal than for the miser to become generous, so it is easier for a rash man to prove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true valour; and believe me, Senor Don Diego, in attempting adventures it is better to lose by a card too many than by a card too few; for to hear it said, ‘such a knight is rash and daring,’ sounds better than ‘such a knight is timid and cowardly.’”\n “I protest, Senor Don Quixote,” said Don Diego, “everything you have said and done is proved correct by the test of reason itself; and I believe, if the laws and ordinances of knight-errantry should be lost, they might be found in your worship’s breast as in their own proper depository and muniment-house; but let us make haste, and reach my village, where you shall take rest after your late exertions; for if they have not been of the body they have been of the spirit, and these sometimes tend to produce bodily fatigue.”\n “I take the invitation as a great favour and honour, Senor Don Diego,” replied Don Quixote; and pressing forward at a better pace than before, at about two in the afternoon they reached the village and house of Don Diego, or, as Don Quixote called him, “The Knight of the Green Gaban.”\n \n 故事说到，唐吉诃德大声喊桑乔给他拿头盔来。桑乔正在牧人那儿买奶酪。他听主人喊得急，慌了手脚，不知拿什么装奶酪好。既然已经付了钱，他舍不得丢掉，匆忙之中想到可以用主人的头盔装奶酪。他抱着这堆东西跑回来，看主人到底要干什么。他刚赶到，唐吉诃德就对他说：\n “赶紧把头盔给我，朋友，我看要有事了。或许前面的事非我不能解决呢。快去拿我的甲胄来。”\n 绿衣人听到此话，举目向四周望去，只见前方有一辆大车迎面向他们走来，车上插着两三面小旗，估计是给皇家送钱的车。他把这意思对唐吉诃德说了，可唐吉诃德不相信，仍以为凡是他遇到的事情都是险情。\n “严阵以待，稳操胜券。我已做好准备，不会有任何失误。根据我的经验，我的敌人有的是看得见的，有的是隐身的，不知什么时候、什么地方，他们就会以某种方式向我进攻。”\n 唐吉诃德转过身去向桑乔要头盔。桑乔来不及把头盔里的奶酪拿出来，只好把头盔连同奶酪一起交给了唐吉诃德。唐吉诃德接过头盔，看也没看，就匆忙扣到了脑袋上。奶酪一经挤压，流出了浆汁，弄得唐吉诃德脸上胡子上都是汁液。唐吉诃德吓了一跳，问桑乔：\n “怎么回事，桑乔？是我的脑袋变软了，还是我的脑浆流出来了，或者是我从脚冒到头上来的汗？如果是我的汗，那肯定不是吓出来的汗水。我相信我现在面临的是非常可怕的艰险。你有什么给我擦脸的东西，赶紧递给我。这么多汗水，我都快看不见了。”\n 桑乔一声不响地递给唐吉诃德一块布，暗自感谢上帝，没有让唐吉诃德把事情看破。唐吉诃德用布擦了擦脸，然后把头盔拿下来，看里面到底是什么东西把他的脑袋弄得凉飕飕的。他一看头盔里是白糊状的东西，就拿到鼻子前闻了闻，说：\n “我以托搏索的杜尔西内亚夫人的生命发誓，你在头盔里放了奶酪，你这个叛徒！不要脸的东西！没有教养的侍从！”\n 桑乔不慌不忙、不露声色地说道：\n “如果是奶酪，您就给我，我把它吃了吧……不过，还是让魔鬼吃吧，准是魔鬼放在里面的。我怎么敢弄脏您的头盔呢？您真是找对人了！我敢打赌，大人，上帝告诉我，肯定也有魔法师在跟我捣乱，因为我是您一手栽培起来的。他们故意把那脏东西放在头盔里面，想激起您的怒火，又像过去一样打我一顿。不过，这次他们是枉费心机了。我相信我的主人办事通情达理，已经注意到我这儿既没有奶酪，也没有牛奶和其他类似的东西。即使有的话，我也会吃到肚子里了，而不是放在头盔里。”\n “这倒有可能。”唐吉诃德说。\n 绅士把这一切看在眼里，心里惊讶，特别是看见唐吉诃德把脑袋、脸、胡子和头盔擦干净后，又把头盔扣到了脑袋上，更是愕然。唐吉诃德在马上坐定，让人拿过剑来，又抓起长矛，说道：\n “不管是谁，让他现在就来吧！即使魔鬼来了，我也做好了准备！”\n 这时，那辆插着旗子的车已经来到跟前，只见车夫骑在骡子上，还有一个人坐在车的前部。唐吉诃德拦在车前，问道：\n “你们到哪儿去，兄弟们？这是谁的车，车上装的是什么东西，那些旗子又是什么旗？”\n 车夫答道：\n “这是我的车，车上是两只关在笼子里的凶猛的狮子。这是奥兰的总督送给国王陛下的礼物。旗子是我们国王的旗，表示这车上是他的东西。”\n “狮子很大吗？”唐吉诃德问。\n “太大了，”坐在车前的那个人说，“从非洲运到西班牙的狮子里，没有比它们更大的，连像它们一样大的也没有。我是管狮人。我运送过许多狮子，但是像这两只这样的，还从来没有运送过。这是一雄一雌。雄狮关在前面的笼子里，雌狮关在后面的笼子里。它们今天还没吃东西，饿得很。您让一下路，我们得赶紧走，以便找个能够喂它们的地方。”\n 唐吉诃德笑了笑，说道：\n “想拿小狮子吓唬我？用狮子吓唬我！已经晚了！我向上帝发誓，我要让这两位运送狮子的大人看看，我到底是不是那种怕狮子的人！喂，你下来！你既然是管狮人，就把笼子打开，把狮子放出来。我要让你看看，曼查的唐吉诃德到底是什么人，即使魔法师弄来狮子我也不怕！”\n “这下可好了，”绅士心中暗想，“这下我们的骑士可露馅了，肯定是那些奶酪泡软了他的脑袋，让他的脑子化脓了。”\n 这时桑乔来到绅士身旁，对他说：\n “大人，看在上帝份上，想个办法别让我的主人动那些狮子吧。否则，咱们都得被撕成碎片。”\n “难道你的主人是疯子吗？”绅士问道，“你竟然如此害怕，相信他会去碰那些凶猛的野兽？”\n “他不是疯子，”桑乔说，“他只是太鲁莽了。”\n “我能让他不鲁莽。”绅士说。\n 唐吉诃德正催着管狮人打开笼子。绅士来到唐吉诃德身旁，对他说道：\n “骑士大人，游侠骑士应该从事那些有望成功的冒险，而不要从事那些根本不可能成功的事情。勇敢如果到了让人害怕的地步，那就算不上勇敢，而应该说是发疯了。更何况这些狮子并不是冲着您来的，它们根本就没这个意思。它们是被当作礼物送给陛下的，拦着狮子，不让送狮人赶路就不合适了。”\n “绅士大人，”唐吉诃德说，“您还是跟您温顺的石鸡和凶猛的白鼬去讲道理吧。每个人管好自己的事就行了。这是我的事，我知道这些狮子是不是冲着我来的。”\n 唐吉诃德又转过身去对管狮人说：\n “我发誓，你这个混蛋，如果你不赶紧打开笼子，我就要用这支长矛把你插在这辆车上。”\n 赶车人见唐吉诃德这身古怪的盔甲，又见他决心已下，就对他说：\n “我的大人，求您行个好，在放出狮子之前先让我把骡子卸下来吧。如果狮子把骡子咬死，我这辈子就完了。除了这几匹骡子和这辆车，我就没什么财产了。”\n “你这个人真是胆小！”唐吉诃德说，“那你就下来，把骡子解开吧，随你便。不过，你马上就可以知道，你是白忙活一场，根本不用费这个劲。”\n 赶车人从骡子背上下来，赶紧把骡子从车上解下来。管狮人高声说道：\n “在场的诸位可以作证，我是被迫违心地打开笼子，放出狮子的。而且，我还要向这位大人声明，这两只畜生造成的各种损失都由他负责，而且还得赔偿我的工钱和损失。在我打开笼子之前，请各位先藏好。反正我心里有数，狮子不会咬我。”\n 绅士再次劝唐吉诃德不要做这种发疯的事，这简直是在冒犯上帝。唐吉诃德说，他知道自己在做什么。绅士让他再好好考虑一下，就会知道他是在自欺欺人。\n “大人，”唐吉诃德说，“假如您现在不想做这个您认为是悲剧的观众，就赶快骑上您的母马，躲到安全的地方去吧。”\n 桑乔听到此话，眼含热泪地劝唐吉诃德放弃这个打算。若与此事相比，风车之战呀，砑布机那儿的可怕遭遇呀，以及他以前的所有惊险奇遇，都是小巫见大巫了。\n “您看，大人，”桑乔说，“这里并没有什么魔法之类的东西。我看见笼子的栅栏里伸出了一只真正的狮爪。由此我猜，既然狮子的爪子就有那么大，那只狮子肯定是个庞然大物。”\n “你因为害怕，”唐吉诃德说，“所以觉得那只狮子至少有半边天那么大。你靠边儿，桑乔，让我来。如果我死在这儿，你知道咱们以前的约定，你就去杜尔西内亚那儿。别的我就不说了。”\n 唐吉诃德又说了其他一些话，看来让他放弃这个怪谲的念头是没指望了。绿衣人想阻止他，可又觉得自己实在难以和唐吉诃德的武器匹敌，而且跟一个像唐吉诃德这样十足的疯子交锋，也算不上什么英雄。唐吉诃德又催促送狮人打开笼门，而且还不断地威胁他。绿衣人利用这段时间赶紧催马离开了。桑乔也骑着他的驴，车夫骑着自己的骡子，都想在狮子出笼之前尽可能地离车远一些。桑乔为唐吉诃德这次肯定会丧生于狮子爪下而哭泣。他还咒骂自己运气不佳，说自己真愚蠢，怎么会想到再次为唐吉诃德当侍从呢。不过哭归哭，怨归怨，他并没有因此就停止催驴跑开。管狮人见该离开的人都已经离开了，就把原来已经软硬兼施过的那一套又软硬兼施了一遍。唐吉诃德告诉管狮人，他即使再软硬兼施，也不会有什么效果，还是趁早离开为好。\n 在管狮人打开笼门的这段时间里，唐吉诃德首先盘算的是与狮子作战时，徒步是否比骑马好。最后他决定步战，怕罗西南多一看见狮子就吓坏了。于是他跳下马，把长矛扔在一旁，拿起盾牌，拔出剑，以非凡的胆量和超常的勇气一步步走到车前，心中诚心诚意地祈求上帝保佑自己，然后又请求他的夫人杜尔西内亚保佑自己。应该说明的是，这个真实故事的作者写到此处，不禁感慨地说道：“啊，曼查的孤胆英雄唐吉诃德，你是世界上所有勇士的楷模，你是新的莱昂·唐曼努埃尔①二世，是西班牙所有骑士的骄傲！我用什么语言来形容你这骇人的事迹呢？我如何才能让以后几个世纪的人相信这是真的呢？我即使极尽赞颂之词，对你来说又有什么过分呢？你孤身一人，浑身是胆，豪情满怀，手持单剑，而且不是那种镌刻着小狗的利剑②，拿的也不是锃亮的钢盾，却准备与来自非洲大森林的两只最凶猛的狮子较量！你的行为将会给你带来荣耀，勇敢的曼查人，我已经找不到合适的词语来赞颂你了。”\n ①据传，一次观看几只从非洲为国王运来的狮子，一位夫人不慎将手套掉进了狮笼。唐曼努埃尔走进狮笼，拾回了手套。\n ②托莱多著名的剑匠胡利安·德尔·雷伊所铸的剑上镌刻有一只小狗作为标志。\n 作者的感叹到此为止。现在言归正传：管狮人见唐吉诃德已摆好了架势，看来再不把狮子放出来是不行了，否则那位已经暴跳如雷的骑士真要不客气了。他只好把第一个笼子的门完全打开。前面说过，这个笼子里关的是一头雄狮，体积庞大，面目狰狞。它本来躺在笼子里，现在它转过身来，抬起爪子，伸个懒腰，张开大嘴，又不慌不忙地打了个呵欠，用它那足有两拃长的舌头舔了舔眼圈。做完这些之后，它把头伸到笼子外面，用它似乎冒着火的眼睛环顾四周。它那副眼神和气势，即使再冒失的人见了也会胆寒。只有这位唐吉诃德认真地盯着狮子，准备等狮子走下车后同它展开一场搏斗，把它撕成碎片。\n 唐吉诃德的癫狂此时已达到了空前的顶峰。可是宽宏大量的狮子却并不那么不可一世，无论小打小闹或者暴跳如雷，它仿佛都满不在乎。就像前面讲到的那样，它环视四周后又转过身去，把屁股朝向唐吉诃德，慢吞吞、懒洋洋地重新在笼子里躺下了。唐吉诃德见状让管狮人打狮子几棍，激它出来。\n “这我可不干，”管狮人说，“如果我去激它，它首先会把我撕成碎片。骑士大人，您该知足了，这就足以表明您的勇气了。您不必再找倒霉了。狮笼的门敞开着，它出来不出来都由它了。不过，它现在还不出来，恐怕今天就不会出来了。您的英雄孤胆已经得到了充分证明。据我了解，任何一位骁勇的斗士都只是向对手挑战，然后在野外等着他。如果对手没有到场，对手就会名誉扫地，而等待交手的那个人就取得了胜利的桂冠。”\n “这倒是真的，”唐吉诃德说，“朋友，把笼门关上吧。不过，你得尽可能为你亲眼看到的我的所作所为做证，那就是你如何打开了笼子，我在此等待，可它不出来；我一再等待，可它还是不出来，而且又重新躺下了。我只能如此了。让魔法见鬼去吧，让上帝帮助理性和真理，帮助真正的骑士精神吧。照我说的，把笼门关上吧。我去叫那些逃跑的人回来，让他们从你的嘴里得知我这番壮举吧。”\n 管狮人把笼门关上了。唐吉诃德把刚才用来擦脸上奶酪的白布系在长矛的铁头上，开始呼唤。那些人在绅士的带领下正马不停蹄地继续逃跑，同时还频频地回过头来看。桑乔看见了白布，说道：\n “我的主人正叫咱们呢。他肯定把狮子打败了。如果不是这样，就叫我天诛地灭！”\n 大家都停住了，认出那个晃动白布的人的确是唐吉诃德，这才稍稍定了神，一点一点地往回走，一直走到能够清楚地听到唐吉诃德喊话的地方，最后才来到大车旁边。他们刚到，唐吉诃德就对车夫说：\n “重新套上你的骡子，兄弟，继续赶你的路吧。桑乔，你拿两个金盾给他和管狮人，就算我耽误了他们的时间而给他们的补偿吧。”\n “我会很高兴地把金盾付给他们，”桑乔说，“不过，狮子现在怎么样了？是死了还是活着呢？”\n 于是管狮人就断断续续而又十分详细地介绍了那次战斗的结局。他尽可能地夸大唐吉诃德的勇气，说狮子一看见唐吉诃德就害怕了。尽管笼门有很长一段时间都是敞开的，可是狮子却不愿意也没胆量从笼子里走出来。骑士本想把狮子赶出来，但由于他对骑士说，那样就是对上帝的冒犯，骑士才很不情愿地让他把笼门关上了。\n “怎么样，桑乔？”唐吉诃德问，“难道还有什么魔法可以斗得过真正的勇气吗？魔法师可以夺走我的运气，但要想夺走我的力量和勇气是不可能的。”\n 桑乔把金盾交给了车夫和管狮人。车夫套上了骡子。管狮人吻了唐吉诃德的手，感谢他的赏赐，并且答应到王宫见到国王时，一定把这件英勇的事迹禀报给国王。\n “假如陛下问这是谁的英雄事迹，你就告诉他是狮子骑士的。从今以后，我要把我以前那个猥獕骑士的称号改成这个称号。我这是沿袭游侠骑士的老规矩，也就是随时根据需要来改变称号。”唐吉诃德说道。\n 大车继续前行，唐吉诃德、桑乔和绿衣人也继续赶自己的路。\n 这时，迭戈·德米兰达默不作声地观察唐吉诃德的言谈举止，觉得这个人说他明白吧却又犯病，说他疯傻吧却又挺明白。迭戈·德米兰达还没听说过有关唐吉诃德的第一部小说。如果他读过那部小说，就会对唐吉诃德的疯癫有所了解，不至于对其言谈举止感到惊奇了。正因为他不知道那本小说，所以他觉得唐吉诃德一会儿像疯子，一会儿又像明白人；听其言，侃侃而谈，头头是道；观其行，则荒谬透顶，冒失莽撞。迭戈·德米兰达自言自语道：“他把装着奶酪的头盔扣在脑袋上，竟以为是魔法师把自己的脑袋弄软了，还有什么比这类事更荒唐的吗？还有什么比要同狮子较量更冒失的吗？”迭戈·德米兰达正在独自思索，暗自嘀咕，唐吉诃德对他说道：\n “迭戈·德米兰达大人，您一定是把我看成言谈举止都十分荒唐的疯子了吧？这也算不了什么，我的所作所为也的确像个疯子。但即使如此，我还是希望您注意到，我并不是像您想象的那样又疯又笨。一位骑士当着国王的面，在一个巨大的广场中央一枪刺中一头咆哮的公牛，自然体面；骑士披一身闪光的盔甲，在夫人们面前得意洋洋地进入比武竞技场，诚然风光；骑士的所有武术演练都是很露脸的事情，既可以供王宫贵族开心消遣，又可以为他们增光。不过，这些都还是不如游侠骑士体面。游侠骑士游历沙漠荒野，穿过大路小道，翻山岭，越森林，四处征险，就是想完成自己的光荣使命，得以万世留芳。我认为，游侠骑士在某个人烟稀少的地方帮助一位寡妇，比一位宫廷骑士在城市里向某位公主献殷勤要光荣得多。所有的骑士都各负其责。宫廷骑士服侍贵夫人们，身着侍从制服为国王点缀门面，用自己家丰盛的食物供养贫困的骑士，组织比武，参加比赛，表现出伟大豪爽的气魄，尤其要表现出一个虔诚的基督徒的品德，这样才算完成了自己的职责。可是，游侠骑士要到世界最偏远的地方去，闯入最困难的迷津，争取做到常人难以做到的事情，在草木稀少的地方顶着酷夏的炎炎烈日，在冰天雪地的严冬冒着凛冽的寒冷；狮子吓不住他们，在魑魅魍魉面前他们也无所畏惧，而是寻找它们，向它们进攻，战胜它们，这才是游侠骑士真正重要的职责。\n “命运使我有幸成为游侠骑士的一员，我不能放弃我认为属于我的职责范围内的任何一个进攻机会。因此，向狮子发动进攻完全是我应该做的事情，虽然我也知道这显得过分鲁莽了。我知道何谓勇敢，它是介于两种缺陷之间的一种美德，不过，宁可勇敢过头，近于鲁莽，也不要害怕到成为胆小鬼的地步；这就好像挥霍比吝啬更接近慷慨一样，鲁莽也比怯懦更接近真正的勇敢。在这类征服艰险的事情中，迭戈大人，请您相信，即使输牌，也要能争取一张牌就多争取一张，因为听人家说‘这个骑士大胆莽撞’，总要比听人家说‘这个骑士胆小怕事’好得多。”\n “唐吉诃德大人，”迭戈说，“您的所有言行合情合理。我估计，即使游侠骑士的规则完全失传了，也可以在您的心中找到。这些规则已经储存在您的心中。天已经晚了，咱们得加紧赶到我家那个村子去。您也该休息了，辛劳半天，即使身体上不感觉累，精神上也该觉到累了。精神上的疲劳同样可以导致身体上的劳累。”\n “我十分荣幸地接受您的盛情邀请，迭戈大人。”唐吉诃德说。\n 两人加速催马向前。大约下午两点时，他们赶到了迭戈家所在的那个村庄。唐吉诃德称迭戈为绿衣骑士。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4638.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don
