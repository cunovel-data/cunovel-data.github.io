{"id":42192,"no":52,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 51","content":"Three leagues from this valley there is a village which, though small, is one of the richest in all this neighbourhood, and in it there lived a farmer, a very worthy man, and so much respected that, although to be so is the natural consequence of being rich, he was even more respected for his virtue than for the wealth he had acquired. But what made him still more fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of such exceeding beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, that everyone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary gifts with which heaven and nature had endowed her. As a child she was beautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteen she was most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroad through all the villages around — but why do I say the villages around, merely, when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into the halls of royalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who came from all sides to see her as if to see something rare and curious, or some wonder-working image? Her father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there are no locks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better than her own modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of the daughter led many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a wife; but he, as one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a jewel, was perplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of her countless suitors he should entrust her. I was one among the many who felt a desire so natural, and, as her father knew who I was, and I was of the same town, of pure blood, in the bloom of life, and very rich in possessions, I had great hopes of success. There was another of the same place and qualifications who also sought her, and this made her father’s choice hang in the balance, for he felt that on either of us his daughter would be well bestowed; so to escape from this state of perplexity he resolved to refer the matter to Leandra (for that is the name of the rich damsel who has reduced me to misery), reflecting that as we were both equal it would be best to leave it to his dear daughter to choose according to her inclination — a course that is worthy of imitation by all fathers who wish to settle their children in life. I do not mean that they ought to leave them to make a choice of what is contemptible and bad, but that they should place before them what is good and then allow them to make a good choice as they please. I do not know which Leandra chose; I only know her father put us both off with the tender age of his daughter and vague words that neither bound him nor dismissed us. My rival is called Anselmo and I myself Eugenio — that you may know the names of the personages that figure in this tragedy, the end of which is still in suspense, though it is plain to see it must be disastrous. About this time there arrived in our town one Vicente de la Roca, the son of a poor peasant of the same town, the said Vicente having returned from service as a soldier in Italy and divers other parts. A captain who chanced to pass that way with his company had carried him off from our village when he was a boy of about twelve years, and now twelve years later the young man came back in a soldier’s uniform, arrayed in a thousand colours, and all over glass trinkets and fine steel chains. To-day he would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in another; but all flimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth. The peasant folk, who are naturally malicious, and when they have nothing to do can be malice itself, remarked all this, and took note of his finery and jewellery, piece by piece, and discovered that he had three suits of different colours, with garters and stockings to match; but he made so many arrangements and combinations out of them, that if they had not counted them, anyone would have sworn that he had made a display of more than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do not look upon all this that I am telling you about the clothes as uncalled for or spun out, for they have a great deal to do with the story. He used to seat himself on a bench under the great poplar in our plaza, and there he would keep us all hanging open-mouthed on the stories he told us of his exploits. There was no country on the face of the globe he had not seen, nor battle he had not been engaged in; he had killed more Moors than there are in Morocco and Tunis, and fought more single combats, according to his own account, than Garcilaso, Diego Garcia de Paredes and a thousand others he named, and out of all he had come victorious without losing a drop of blood. On the other hand he showed marks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out, he said were gunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions. Lastly, with monstrous impudence he used to say “you” to his equals and even those who knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his father and his deeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as the king himself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of a musician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that some said he made it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he was something of a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the town he made a ballad a league long. This soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca, this bravo, gallant, musician, poet, was often seen and watched by Leandra from a window of her house which looked out on the plaza. The glitter of his showy attire took her fancy, his ballads bewitched her (for he gave away twenty copies of every one he made), the tales of his exploits which he told about himself came to her ears; and in short, as the devil no doubt had arranged it, she fell in love with him before the presumption of making love to her had suggested itself to him; and as in love-affairs none are more easily brought to an issue than those which have the inclination of the lady for an ally, Leandra and Vicente came to an understanding without any difficulty; and before any of her numerous suitors had any suspicion of her design, she had already carried it into effect, having left the house of her dearly beloved father (for mother she had none), and disappeared from the village with the soldier, who came more triumphantly out of this enterprise than out of any of the large number he laid claim to. All the village and all who heard of it were amazed at the affair; I was aghast, Anselmo thunderstruck, her father full of grief, her relations indignant, the authorities all in a ferment, the officers of the Brotherhood in arms. They scoured the roads, they searched the woods and all quarters, and at the end of three days they found the flighty Leandra in a mountain cave, stript to her shift, and robbed of all the money and precious jewels she had carried away from home with her. They brought her back to her unhappy father, and questioned her as to her misfortune, and she confessed without pressure that Vicente de la Roca had deceived her, and under promise of marrying her had induced her to leave her father’s house, as he meant to take her to the richest and most delightful city in the whole world, which was Naples; and that she, ill-advised and deluded, had believed him, and robbed her father, and handed over all to him the night she disappeared; and that he had carried her away to a rugged mountain and shut her up in the eave where they had found her. She said, moreover, that the soldier, without robbing her of her honour, had taken from her everything she had, and made off, leaving her in the cave, a thing that still further surprised everybody. It was not easy for us to credit the young man’s continence, but she asserted it with such earnestness that it helped to console her distressed father, who thought nothing of what had been taken since the jewel that once lost can never be recovered had been left to his daughter. The same day that Leandra made her appearance her father removed her from our sight and took her away to shut her up in a convent in a town near this, in the hope that time may wear away some of the disgrace she has incurred. Leandra’s youth furnished an excuse for her fault, at least with those to whom it was of no consequence whether she was good or bad; but those who knew her shrewdness and intelligence did not attribute her misdemeanour to ignorance but to wantonness and the natural disposition of women, which is for the most part flighty and ill-regulated. Leandra withdrawn from sight, Anselmo’s eyes grew blind, or at any rate found nothing to look at that gave them any pleasure, and mine were in darkness without a ray of light to direct them to anything enjoyable while Leandra was away. Our melancholy grew greater, our patience grew less; we cursed the soldier’s finery and railed at the carelessness of Leandra’s father. At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave the village and come to this valley; and, he feeding a great flock of sheep of his own, and I a large herd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the trees, giving vent to our sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra’s praises, or upbraiding her, or else sighing alone, and to heaven pouring forth our complaints in solitude. Following our example, many more of Leandra’s lovers have come to these rude mountains and adopted our mode of life, and they are so numerous that one would fancy the place had been turned into the pastoral Arcadia, so full is it of shepherds and sheep-folds; nor is there a spot in it where the name of the fair Leandra is not heard. Here one curses her and calls her capricious, fickle, and immodest, there another condemns her as frail and frivolous; this pardons and absolves her, that spurns and reviles her; one extols her beauty, another assails her character, and in short all abuse her, and all adore her, and to such a pitch has this general infatuation gone that there are some who complain of her scorn without ever having exchanged a word with her, and even some that bewail and mourn the raging fever of jealousy, for which she never gave anyone cause, for, as I have already said, her misconduct was known before her passion. There is no nook among the rocks, no brookside, no shade beneath the trees that is not haunted by some shepherd telling his woes to the breezes; wherever there is an echo it repeats the name of Leandra; the mountains ring with “Leandra,” “Leandra” murmur the brooks, and Leandra keeps us all bewildered and bewitched, hoping without hope and fearing without knowing what we fear. Of all this silly set the one that shows the least and also the most sense is my rival Anselmo, for having so many other things to complain of, he only complains of separation, and to the accompaniment of a rebeck, which he plays admirably, he sings his complaints in verses that show his ingenuity. I follow another, easier, and to my mind wiser course, and that is to rail at the frivolity of women, at their inconstancy, their double dealing, their broken promises, their unkept pledges, and in short the want of reflection they show in fixing their affections and inclinations. This, sirs, was the reason of words and expressions I made use of to this goat when I came up just now; for as she is a female I have a contempt for her, though she is the best in all my fold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and if I have been tedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut is close by, and I have fresh milk and dainty cheese there, as well as a variety of toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to the palate. “离这个山谷不到三里地的地方有个村庄。村庄虽小，在这一带却是最富裕的。这个村里有个很受人尊敬的农夫。他虽然富裕，可人们尊敬他主要是由于他的品德，并不是因为他富裕。不过据他自己说，他最幸运的就是有个特别漂亮、极其聪明、文静而又规矩的女儿。凡是认识或见过这个女孩子的人都感叹老天让她天生这样漂亮的模样。她小时候就很漂亮，长大后简直成了美女。她长到十六岁的时候，简直是天下绝伦了。她的美貌开始名扬周围的所有村庄。岂止是四周的村庄呢，已经传到了很远的城里，甚至传进了国王的王宫以及各式各样人的耳朵里。大家都像看什么稀罕物或者新奇人物似的从四面八方跑来看她。她父亲把她看得很紧，她自己也洁身自好。女孩子如果不自重，任何铁锁或者看管都是无济于事的。 “父亲的财富和女儿的美貌打动了很多人。不论本村还是外乡的，都来向她求婚。不过就像一个拥有很多珠宝的人一样，父亲竟拿不定主意，不知在众多的求婚者里该选择谁好了。我也是这许多求婚者中的一个。大家都觉得我很有希望，因为我是本地人，她父亲认识我，而且我家世清白，风华正茂，家境富裕，智力也不差。不过，本村另一个求婚者和我条件差不多。她父亲觉得我们两个人都配得上自己的女儿，迟迟拿不定主意。于是他对莱安德拉说，那个姑娘叫莱安德拉，既然我们两个人条件相当，就由她本人来选择。这下我可麻烦了。不过，她父亲这种做法还是值得所有企图为自己子女安排婚事的父母学习的。我并不是主张允许子女们选择卑鄙的坏蛋，而是应该向子女们提出好的人选，让他们在这些好人选里进行选择。我不知道莱安德拉选择了谁，只知道她父亲借口她年龄小并用其他一些泛泛的话敷衍，既不答应也不拒绝我们。我的对手叫安塞尔莫，我叫欧亨尼奥，让你们先知道这个悲剧里的人物名字吧。事情虽然到现在还没有结局，不过可以料想到结局一定不幸。 “这时我们村子里来了个叫比森特·德拉罗沙的人，他是本地一个贫苦农夫的儿子。这个比森特当了兵，去过意大利和其它一些地方。他十二岁那年，一个上尉带着他的队伍从村里经过时，把他带走了。又过了十二年，他穿着一身花花绿绿、满是玻璃坠儿和金属细链的军服回来了。他今天穿这身衣服，明天换那套衣服，但都是又薄又花、质地一般的料子做的。农夫们本来就爱说长道短，但总得有了话柄，人们才好说长道短。那些人逐一数了他的服装和装饰品，发现他的衣服虽然颜色不同，可是连袜带和袜子一共只有三套。不过，他用这三套衣服换穿出了很多式样来。有人给他数过，说他一共换穿过十多套衣服，有二十多种羽饰。别以为我说这些衣服是无关紧要的事，正是这些衣服在很大程度上促成了这个故事。 “我们村空场上有一棵杨树，他坐在杨树下的石凳上向我们讲述他的英雄事迹，我们听得目瞪口呆。世界上没有什么地方他没去过，没有什么战斗他没参加过。他杀死的摩尔人比摩洛哥和突尼斯的摩尔人总数还要多。他曾经历过许多惊心动魄的格斗，据他说，其程度远远超过了甘特和卢纳，超过了迭戈·加西亚·德帕雷德斯和他列数的其他许多人。每次都是他取胜，而且没流过一滴血。与此同时，他又让我们看他过去受伤留下的伤疤，说是在多次交火中受的伤。其实他身上什么伤疤也没有。他还带着一种无形的傲慢跟与他同辈或认识他的人以‘你’相称。他常说他的靠山就是他父亲，他的事迹就是他的家世，他已当过兵，对国王也不欠什么了。除了傲慢之外，他还装作懂点音乐，能拨拉几下吉他，于是有人就说他是在用吉他说话。不过他的才能还不只这些，他还有作诗的天赋，每当村里发生一点芝麻大的小事，他就能编出很长很长的歌谣来。 “我描述的这位士兵，这位比森特·德拉罗沙，这位勇士、美男子、音乐家、诗人，被莱安德拉从她家一扇能够看到空场的窗户里看到了。他引人注目的服装的假相使莱安德拉产生了爱慕之情，他的歌谣迷住了莱安德拉。比森特每写一首歌谣都要抄出二十份送人。比森特自己说的那些事迹传到了莱安德拉的耳朵里，结果鬼使神差，莱安德拉竟在比森特还不敢妄自向她献殷勤时就先爱上了比森特。谈情说爱这种事要是女方主动，那就再容易不过了。这么多求婚者还没有一个人意识到莱安德拉这个心思时，莱安德拉就同比森特迅速敲定了，而且也完成了。她抛弃了她可爱的父亲，她母亲已经过世了，她同那个当兵的逃离了村庄。比森特这件事做得比他所有做过的事都成功。 “全村和所有听说这个消息的人都感到很意外。我深感震惊，安塞尔莫也目瞪口呆。她父亲伤心不已，她的亲戚们愤慨极了，司法机关积极寻找，圣友团整装待命。他们在路上设卡，在树林和各个地方搜索，过了三天，才在一个山洞里找到了任性的莱安德拉。当时她身上只剩下一件衬衣了，出来时从家里拿的钱和珍宝也所剩无几了。她被送回她那悲痛欲绝的父亲面前。大家打听她的遭遇，她坦然承认说比森特·德拉罗沙骗了她，说要娶她为妻，让她离开父亲的家，带她到世界上最富有、最奢华的城市那不勒斯去。她没有多考虑，鬼迷心窍，竟信以为真，于是偷了父亲的东西，在逃走的当天晚上就把这些东西全交给了比森特。比森特把她带到一座险峻的山上，把她关在那个山洞里。莱安德拉说那个当兵的并没有玷污她，只是拿了她所有的东西走了，把她一个人丢在那里。这又使大家感到很意外。 “实在让人难以相信那个当兵的会那么老实，可她非常肯定地坚持这一点，这倒让她本来十分伤心的父亲有所安慰，既然他的女儿保住了最宝贵的东西，而那个东西一旦丧失，就难以挽回，那么，损失些钱财也就算了。莱安德拉回来那天，她父亲就把她送到附近一个镇上的修道院，希望随着时间的推移，人们对他女儿的不好印象可以有所减轻。莱安德拉还年轻，所以情有可原，至少对莱安德拉品行无所谓的人这么想，可那些知道她机灵而又聪明的人却说，她做错了这件事并不是由于她无知，而是由于女人轻率的天性造成的，大多数女人都头脑欠缺，行为欠稳重。 “莱安德拉被送进修道院后，安塞尔莫就开始目光呆滞，至少从他的眼睛看不出有什么可以让他高兴的事了。我的目光也开始黯然，对任何值得高兴的事情都无动于衷。莱安德拉走后，我们的忧郁与日俱增，耐心逐渐丧失，诅咒那个当兵的军服鲜亮，憎恶莱安德拉的父亲对她不严加看管。最后，我和安塞尔莫商定离开村庄，来到这个山谷。他放了一大群羊，我放的羊也不少。我们在树林里过着我们的生活，或者一起唱歌，赞颂或咒骂美丽的莱安德拉，或者独自叹息，向天倾诉自己的痛苦，以此排遣自己的情感。 “很多莱安德拉的追求者也学着我们的样子，来到这险峻的山上放起羊来。来的人很多，这个地方简直成了阿卡迪亚田园①，到处都是牧人和羊圈，到处都能听到美丽的莱安德拉的名字。这个人咒骂她，说她任性易变，不老实；那个人说她太轻率；有人为她开脱，原谅她；也有人既为她辩解又咒骂她；有人称赞她的美貌；还有人斥责她的本性。总之，所有人都羞辱她，所有人又都崇拜她，简直都疯了，甚至有的人根本没同莱安德拉说过话，却说莱安德拉看不起他；也有人唉声叹气，嫉恨得像得了疯病。其实，莱安德拉不应该引起别人的嫉恨，我刚才说过，她还没有来得及表露就办了错事。岩石间，小溪旁，树荫下，处处都有牧羊人在向老天倾诉自己的厄运。在可能形成回音之处，都回响着莱安德拉的名字。山间回荡着‘莱安德拉’，小溪低吟着‘莱安德拉’，莱安德拉弄得我们这些人神魂颠倒，疯疯癫癫，本来无望，却又期望，无可恐惧，却又恐惧。我觉得在这群疯疯癫癫的人里，最明白又最不明白的就是我的对手安塞尔莫了。他本来有很多可怨莱安德拉的理由，可是他偏偏只怨莱安德拉不该离开他。他还弹三弦牧琴，弹得好极了；他吟诗，他的诗表现出他很有天赋；他歌唱，唱着自己的悲怨。我自有我的做法，我觉得这样做最合适，也就是诉说女人的轻浮多变，两面三刀，言而无信，一句话，她们不知道如何寄托自己的思想和感情。各位大人，这就是我刚才对这只小羊说那番话的缘由。虽然这只羊是那群羊里最漂亮的一只，可因为它是母羊，我却不希罕它。我要给你们讲的故事就是这些。可能我讲得长了些，不过我招待你们不会薄。我的羊栏离这儿不远，那儿有新鲜的羊奶和味道极美的奶酪，还有各种甘甜的水果，看着好看，吃起来也香。” ①指古希腊伯罗奔尼撒半岛中部地区。古代居民的牧歌式生活使它在古罗马田园诗和文艺复兴时期的文学作品中被描绘成希腊的世外桃源。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4619.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
