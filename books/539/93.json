{"id":42233,"no":93,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 39","content":"By every word that Sancho uttered, the duchess was as much delighted as Don Quixote was driven to desperation. He bade him hold his tongue, and the Distressed One went on to say: “At length, after much questioning and answering, as the princess held to her story, without changing or varying her previous declaration, the Vicar gave his decision in favour of Don Clavijo, and she was delivered over to him as his lawful wife; which the Queen Dona Maguncia, the Princess Antonomasia’s mother, so took to heart, that within the space of three days we buried her.”\\n\\n “She died, no doubt,” said Sancho.\\n\\n “Of course,” said Trifaldin; “they don’t bury living people in Kandy, only the dead.”\\n\\n “Senor Squire,” said Sancho, “a man in a swoon has been known to be buried before now, in the belief that he was dead; and it struck me that Queen Maguncia ought to have swooned rather than died; because with life a great many things come right, and the princess’s folly was not so great that she need feel it so keenly. If the lady had married some page of hers, or some other servant of the house, as many another has done, so I have heard say, then the mischief would have been past curing. But to marry such an elegant accomplished gentleman as has been just now described to us — indeed, indeed, though it was a folly, it was not such a great one as you think; for according to the rules of my master here — and he won’t allow me to lie — as of men of letters bishops are made, so of gentlemen knights, specially if they be errant, kings and emperors may be made.”\\n\\n “Thou art right, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for with a knight-errant, if he has but two fingers’ breadth of good fortune, it is on the cards to become the mightiest lord on earth. But let senora the Distressed One proceed; for I suspect she has got yet to tell us the bitter part of this so far sweet story.”\\n\\n “The bitter is indeed to come,” said the countess; “and such bitter that colocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison. The queen, then, being dead, and not in a swoon, we buried her; and hardly had we covered her with earth, hardly had we said our last farewells, when, quis talia fando temperet a lachrymis? over the queen’s grave there appeared, mounted upon a wooden horse, the giant Malambruno, Maguncia’s first cousin, who besides being cruel is an enchanter; and he, to revenge the death of his cousin, punish the audacity of Don Clavijo, and in wrath at the contumacy of Antonomasia, left them both enchanted by his art on the grave itself; she being changed into an ape of brass, and he into a horrible crocodile of some unknown metal; while between the two there stands a pillar, also of metal, with certain characters in the Syriac language inscribed upon it, which, being translated into Kandian, and now into Castilian, contain the following sentence: ‘These two rash lovers shall not recover their former shape until the valiant Manchegan comes to do battle with me in single combat; for the Fates reserve this unexampled adventure for his mighty valour alone.’ This done, he drew from its sheath a huge broad scimitar, and seizing me by the hair he made as though he meant to cut my throat and shear my head clean off. I was terror-stricken, my voice stuck in my throat, and I was in the deepest distress; nevertheless I summoned up my strength as well as I could, and in a trembling and piteous voice I addressed such words to him as induced him to stay the infliction of a punishment so severe. He then caused all the duennas of the palace, those that are here present, to be brought before him; and after having dwelt upon the enormity of our offence, and denounced duennas, their characters, their evil ways and worse intrigues, laying to the charge of all what I alone was guilty of, he said he would not visit us with capital punishment, but with others of a slow nature which would be in effect civil death for ever; and the very instant he ceased speaking we all felt the pores of our faces opening, and pricking us, as if with the points of needles. We at once put our hands up to our faces and found ourselves in the state you now see.”\\n\\n Here the Distressed One and the other duennas raised the veils with which they were covered, and disclosed countenances all bristling with beards, some red, some black, some white, and some grizzled, at which spectacle the duke and duchess made a show of being filled with wonder. Don Quixote and Sancho were overwhelmed with amazement, and the bystanders lost in astonishment, while the Trifaldi went on to say: “Thus did that malevolent villain Malambruno punish us, covering the tenderness and softness of our faces with these rough bristles! Would to heaven that he had swept off our heads with his enormous scimitar instead of obscuring the light of our countenances with these wool-combings that cover us! For if we look into the matter, sirs (and what I am now going to say I would say with eyes flowing like fountains, only that the thought of our misfortune and the oceans they have already wept, keep them as dry as barley spears, and so I say it without tears), where, I ask, can a duenna with a beard to to? What father or mother will feel pity for her? Who will help her? For, if even when she has a smooth skin, and a face tortured by a thousand kinds of washes and cosmetics, she can hardly get anybody to love her, what will she do when she shows a countenace turned into a thicket? Oh duennas, companions mine! it was an unlucky moment when we were born and an ill-starred hour when our fathers begot us!” And as she said this she showed signs of being about to faint.\\n\\n \\n\\n 无论桑乔说什么，公爵夫人都很喜欢听，可是唐吉诃德却急坏了，他让桑乔赶紧住嘴。忧伤妇人又接着说道：\\n\\n “简单说吧，后来几经反复，公主还是坚持己见，不改初衷，于是牧师批准了克拉维霍的请求，让安东诺玛霞做了他的妻子。这一下可把安东诺玛霞的母亲唐娜马贡西娅气坏了。\\n\\n 没过三天，我们就把她埋掉了。”\\n\\n “那么她准是死了。”桑乔说。\\n\\n “那当然，”白胡子三摆说，“在坎达亚从来不埋活人，只埋死人。”\\n\\n “侍从大人，”桑乔说，“以前可有过晕过去的人被当成死人埋掉的事情。我觉得马贡西娅王后可能是晕过去了，并不是死了。只要人还活着，很多事都可以商量，而且公主的事也并不是什么很大的蠢事，何至于让她这么难过！如果公主同某个侍童，或者同她家的某个佣人结了婚，这种事常有，那才是没有办法的糟糕事呢。若是照您说的，她嫁给了一个英俊而又有才华的男子，即使是件蠢事，也并不像人们想象得那么蠢。按照我主人的规定，他就在旁边，从来不许我说谎，既然文人雅士可以成为主教，那么骑士，特别是游侠骑士，就完全可以成为国王和皇帝。”\\n\\n “你说得对，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“游侠骑士只要有一点运气，就可以成为世界上最高贵的主人。不过忧伤妇人，请您继续讲下去吧，我似乎觉得这个甜蜜的故事后面就是悲苦的部分了。”\\n\\n “岂止是苦呀，”伯爵夫人说，“而且是苦得很呢！与这个苦比起来，药西瓜①都算是甜的，夹竹桃也算是香的了。王后不是昏过去了，她确实是死了，我们把她掩埋了。这事谁能闻之不泣呢？我们刚刚把土盖好，还没来得及说一声‘安息吧’，就看见马贡西娅的表兄马兰布鲁诺巨人骑着一匹木马出现在王后的坟墓上。他这个人不仅狠毒，而且会魔法。为了给王后报仇，他就在王后的坟墓上对胆大妄为的克拉维霍和轻佻放纵的安东诺玛霞施了魔法。他把安东诺玛霞变成了一只青铜母猴，把克拉维霍变成了一条不知是什么金属的可怕鳄鱼，在他们俩中间还立了一个同样是用那种金属做的纪念碑，上面用叙利亚文写了几行字，若是译成坎达亚语，现在再翻成西班牙语，意思就是：‘在曼查的勇士同我展开一场恶战之前，这一对胆大妄为的情人不得恢复原状，这次空前的事件要靠那位勇士才能解决。’施完魔法后，马兰布鲁诺从刀鞘里抽出一把又长又大的大刀，揪着我的头发，做出要切断我的喉咙、割掉我的脑袋的样子。我吓坏了，可我还是竭尽我的全力，声音颤抖而又痛苦地对他说这说那，这才使他放了手。最后，他把王宫里的所有女仆都叫来，也就是现在旁边这几位女仆，除了大骂女仆们品行恶劣、诡计多端之外，还把我的罪责也都加到了她们身上。他说，他不想一下子杀了我们，他要慢慢地折磨我们，让我们欲死不能，欲活不成。他刚说完这句话，我们就觉得我们脸上的毛孔都张开了，整张脸都像被针扎了似的，用手一摸脸，我们发现自己已经变成了现在这模样。”\\n\\n ①一种植物，味苦。\\n\\n 忧伤妇人和其他女仆说着就摘掉了头罩，露出了满是胡须的脸庞，有的是金黄色的，有的是黑色的，有的是白色的，还有的是灰白色的。公爵和公爵夫人都惊讶不已，唐吉诃德和桑乔也呆住了，在场的其他人更是面带惧色。“三摆裙夫人”又接着说道：\\n\\n “那个坏蛋马兰布鲁诺就是这样惩罚我们的，他用这些猪鬃似的东西遮盖了我们娇嫩的脸庞。我宁愿祈求老天让他用大刀割掉我们的脑袋，也不愿意让这些毛烘烘的东西遮住我们的脸！再往下讲我本来会泪如泉涌的，可是一想到我们遭受的不幸，我们已经欲哭无泪，所以再往下讲我也就不会流泪了。咱们不妨想一想，诸位大人，一个满脸胡须的女仆能够到哪儿去呢？谁家的父母能不为自己的女儿变成这个样子而心疼呢？谁能帮助她呢？以前她的脸细滑柔嫩，还涂了很多香脂，尚且没有人十分爱她，现在她满脸胡须，又该怎么办呢？我的女仆伙伴们啊，咱们真是生不逢时啊，父母是在不吉利的时辰生养了我们！”\\n\\n 说到这儿，她似乎要昏过去了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4660.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
