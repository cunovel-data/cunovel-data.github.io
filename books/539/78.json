{"id":42218,"no":78,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 24","content":"He who translated this great history from the original written by its first author, Cide Hamete Benengeli, says that on coming to the chapter giving the adventures of the cave of Montesinos he found written on the margin of it, in Hamete’s own hand, these exact words: “I cannot convince or persuade myself that everything that is written in the preceding chapter could have precisely happened to the valiant Don Quixote; and for this reason, that all the adventures that have occurred up to the present have been possible and probable; but as for this one of the cave, I see no way of accepting it as true, as it passes all reasonable bounds. For me to believe that Don Quixote could lie, he being the most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of his time, is impossible; he would not have told a lie though he were shot to death with arrows. On the other hand, I reflect that he related and told the story with all the circumstances detailed, and that he could not in so short a space have fabricated such a vast complication of absurdities; if, then, this adventure seems apocryphal, it is no fault of mine; and so, without affirming its falsehood or its truth, I write it down. Decide for thyself in thy wisdom, reader; for I am not bound, nor is it in my power, to do more; though certain it is they say that at the time of his death he retracted, and said he had invented it, thinking it matched and tallied with the adventures he had read of in his histories.” And then he goes on to say: The cousin was amazed as well at Sancho’s boldness as at the patience of his master, and concluded that the good temper the latter displayed arose from the happiness he felt at having seen his lady Dulcinea, even enchanted as she was; because otherwise the words and language Sancho had addressed to him deserved a thrashing; for indeed he seemed to him to have been rather impudent to his master, to whom he now observed, “I, Senor Don Quixote of La Mancha, look upon the time I have spent in travelling with your worship as very well employed, for I have gained four things in the course of it; the first is that I have made your acquaintance, which I consider great good fortune; the second, that I have learned what the cave of Montesinos contains, together with the transformations of Guadiana and of the lakes of Ruidera; which will be of use to me for the Spanish Ovid that I have in hand; the third, to have discovered the antiquity of cards, that they were in use at least in the time of Charlemagne, as may be inferred from the words you say Durandarte uttered when, at the end of that long spell while Montesinos was talking to him, he woke up and said, ‘Patience and shuffle.’ This phrase and expression he could not have learned while he was enchanted, but only before he had become so, in France, and in the time of the aforesaid emperor Charlemagne. And this demonstration is just the thing for me for that other book I am writing, the ‘Supplement to Polydore Vergil on the Invention of Antiquities;’ for I believe he never thought of inserting that of cards in his book, as I mean to do in mine, and it will be a matter of great importance, particularly when I can cite so grave and veracious an authority as Senor Durandarte. And the fourth thing is, that I have ascertained the source of the river Guadiana, heretofore unknown to mankind.” “You are right,” said Don Quixote; “but I should like to know, if by God’s favour they grant you a licence to print those books of yours — which I doubt — to whom do you mean dedicate them?” “There are lords and grandees in Spain to whom they can be dedicated,” said the cousin. “Not many,” said Don Quixote; “not that they are unworthy of it, but because they do not care to accept books and incur the obligation of making the return that seems due to the author’s labour and courtesy. One prince I know who makes up for all the rest, and more — how much more, if I ventured to say, perhaps I should stir up envy in many a noble breast; but let this stand over for some more convenient time, and let us go and look for some place to shelter ourselves in to-night.” “Not far from this,” said the cousin, “there is a hermitage, where there lives a hermit, who they say was a soldier, and who has the reputation of being a good Christian and a very intelligent and charitable man. Close to the hermitage he has a small house which he built at his own cost, but though small it is large enough for the reception of guests.” “Has this hermit any hens, do you think?” asked Sancho. “Few hermits are without them,” said Don Quixote; “for those we see now-a-days are not like the hermits of the Egyptian deserts who were clad in palm-leaves, and lived on the roots of the earth. But do not think that by praising these I am disparaging the others; all I mean to say is that the penances of those of the present day do not come up to the asceticism and austerity of former times; but it does not follow from this that they are not all worthy; at least I think them so; and at the worst the hypocrite who pretends to be good does less harm than the open sinner.” At this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man on foot, proceeding at a rapid pace, and beating a mule loaded with lances and halberds. When he came up to them, he saluted them and passed on without stopping. Don Quixote called to him, “Stay, good fellow; you seem to be making more haste than suits that mule.” “I cannot stop, senor,” answered the man; “for the arms you see I carry here are to be used tomorrow, so I must not delay; God be with you. But if you want to know what I am carrying them for, I mean to lodge to-night at the inn that is beyond the hermitage, and if you be going the same road you will find me there, and I will tell you some curious things; once more God be with you;” and he urged on his mule at such a pace that Don Quixote had no time to ask him what these curious things were that he meant to tell them; and as he was somewhat inquisitive, and always tortured by his anxiety to learn something new, he decided to set out at once, and go and pass the night at the inn instead of stopping at the hermitage, where the cousin would have had them halt. Accordingly they mounted and all three took the direct road for the inn, which they reached a little before nightfall. On the road the cousin proposed they should go up to the hermitage to drink a sup. The instant Sancho heard this he steered his Dapple towards it, and Don Quixote and the cousin did the same; but it seems Sancho’s bad luck so ordered it that the hermit was not at home, for so a sub-hermit they found in the hermitage told them. They called for some of the best. She replied that her master had none, but that if they liked cheap water she would give it with great pleasure. “If I found any in water,” said Sancho, “there are wells along the road where I could have had enough of it. Ah, Camacho’s wedding, and plentiful house of Don Diego, how often do I miss you!” Leaving the hermitage, they pushed on towards the inn, and a little farther they came upon a youth who was pacing along in front of them at no great speed, so that they overtook him. He carried a sword over his shoulder, and slung on it a budget or bundle of his clothes apparently, probably his breeches or pantaloons, and his cloak and a shirt or two; for he had on a short jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it in places, and had his shirt out; his stockings were of silk, and his shoes square-toed as they wear them at court. His age might have been eighteen or nineteen; he was of a merry countenance, and to all appearance of an active habit, and he went along singing seguidillas to beguile the wearisomeness of the road. As they came up with him he was just finishing one, which the cousin got by heart and they say ran thus — I’m off to the wars For the want of pence, Oh, had I but money I’d show more sense. The first to address him was Don Quixote, who said, “You travel very airily, sir gallant; whither bound, may we ask, if it is your pleasure to tell us?” To which the youth replied, “The heat and my poverty are the reason of my travelling so airily, and it is to the wars that I am bound.” “How poverty?” asked Don Quixote; “the heat one can understand.” “Senor,” replied the youth, “in this bundle I carry velvet pantaloons to match this jacket; if I wear them out on the road, I shall not be able to make a decent appearance in them in the city, and I have not the wherewithal to buy others; and so for this reason, as well as to keep myself cool, I am making my way in this fashion to overtake some companies of infantry that are not twelve leagues off, in which I shall enlist, and there will be no want of baggage trains to travel with after that to the place of embarkation, which they say will be Carthagena; I would rather have the King for a master, and serve him in the wars, than serve a court pauper.” “And did you get any bounty, now?” asked the cousin. “If I had been in the service of some grandee of Spain or personage of distinction,” replied the youth, “I should have been safe to get it; for that is the advantage of serving good masters, that out of the servants’ hall men come to be ancients or captains, or get a good pension. But I, to my misfortune, always served place-hunters and adventurers, whose keep and wages were so miserable and scanty that half went in paying for the starching of one’s collars; it would be a miracle indeed if a page volunteer ever got anything like a reasonable bounty.” “And tell me, for heaven’s sake,” asked Don Quixote, “is it possible, my friend, that all the time you served you never got any livery?” “They gave me two,” replied the page; “but just as when one quits a religious community before making profession, they strip him of the dress of the order and give him back his own clothes, so did my masters return me mine; for as soon as the business on which they came to court was finished, they went home and took back the liveries they had given merely for show.” “What spilorceria! — as an Italian would say,” said Don Quixote; “but for all that, consider yourself happy in having left court with as worthy an object as you have, for there is nothing on earth more honourable or profitable than serving, first of all God, and then one’s king and natural lord, particularly in the profession of arms, by which, if not more wealth, at least more honour is to be won than by letters, as I have said many a time; for though letters may have founded more great houses than arms, still those founded by arms have I know not what superiority over those founded by letters, and a certain splendour belonging to them that distinguishes them above all. And bear in mind what I am now about to say to you, for it will be of great use and comfort to you in time of trouble; it is, not to let your mind dwell on the adverse chances that may befall you; for the worst of all is death, and if it be a good death, the best of all is to die. They asked Julius Caesar, the valiant Roman emperor, what was the best death. He answered, that which is unexpected, which comes suddenly and unforeseen; and though he answered like a pagan, and one without the knowledge of the true God, yet, as far as sparing our feelings is concerned, he was right; for suppose you are killed in the first engagement or skirmish, whether by a cannon ball or blown up by mine, what matters it? It is only dying, and all is over; and according to Terence, a soldier shows better dead in battle, than alive and safe in flight; and the good soldier wins fame in proportion as he is obedient to his captains and those in command over him. And remember, my son, that it is better for the soldier to smell of gunpowder than of civet, and that if old age should come upon you in this honourable calling, though you may be covered with wounds and crippled and lame, it will not come upon you without honour, and that such as poverty cannot lessen; especially now that provisions are being made for supporting and relieving old and disabled soldiers; for it is not right to deal with them after the fashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves when they are old and useless, and, turning them out of their houses under the pretence of making them free, make them slaves to hunger, from which they cannot expect to be released except by death. But for the present I won’t say more than get ye up behind me on my horse as far as the inn, and sup with me there, and to-morrow you shall pursue your journey, and God give you as good speed as your intentions deserve.” The page did not accept the invitation to mount, though he did that to supper at the inn; and here they say Sancho said to himself, “God be with you for a master; is it possible that a man who can say things so many and so good as he has said just now, can say that he saw the impossible absurdities he reports about the cave of Montesinos? Well, well, we shall see.” And now, just as night was falling, they reached the inn, and it was not without satisfaction that Sancho perceived his master took it for a real inn, and not for a castle as usual. The instant they entered Don Quixote asked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds, and was told that he was in the stable seeing to his mule; which was what Sancho and the cousin proceeded to do for their beasts, giving the best manger and the best place in the stable to Rocinante. 这部巨著的译者说，当他翻译到蒙特西诺斯洞窟探险这一章时，发现原作者锡德·哈迈德·贝嫩赫利本人在边白上写了下面几句话： “我不能相信，也不想让自己相信，英勇的唐吉诃德真会遇到前面一章所记述的事情。他在此之前的各种奇遇都还真实可信，而洞窟奇遇这一章却显得不着边际，太超乎常理了。我不能想象，作为那个时代最当之无愧的贵族、最高尚的骑士，唐吉诃德竟会骗人；就是把他杀了，他也不会骗人。另外，我觉得他能讲得这样有声有色，这绝不是短时间内能够编出来的胡话。假如这段经历是杜撰的，我并没有责任，所以我也不管它是真是假，照写不误。读者须慎重对待，自己去判断，我也只能如此而已。不过，我确实听说唐吉诃德在临终之前反悔，承认这一段是他编的，因为他觉得在有关他的故事里应该有一段这样的经历。”然后，作者又言归正传： 小伙子对桑乔的大胆和唐吉诃德的耐心深感惊讶。他以为，唐吉诃德是由于见到了他的夫人杜尔西内亚而高兴，尽管是中了魔法的杜尔西内亚也好，否则，桑乔免不了因为自己的那番话而遭受皮肉之苦，桑乔对主人的那番话确实出格了。小伙子对唐吉诃德说： “唐吉诃德大人，我觉得同您走这一趟确实受益匪浅，我从中得到了四个好处。第一就是认识了您，我觉得这是我的幸运。第二，我知道了这个蒙特西诺斯洞窟里的情况，并且了解了瓜迪亚纳河和鲁伊德拉诸河的变迁，这对我的《西班牙的奥维德》很有益处。第三，我知道了纸牌自古就有，至少在卡洛马尼奥皇帝时代就有了。按照您所说的，蒙特西诺斯同杜兰达尔德说了半天话之后，杜兰达尔德才醒过来说道：‘别着急，那就洗牌吧。’这种话肯定不会是在他被魔法制服以后，而是在他中魔法以前，在法国，即刚才说的那个卡洛马尼奥皇帝时代学会的。这个考证对于我正在编写的另一本书《维尔吉利奥·波利多罗古代发明补遗》也同样很有帮助。我觉得那本书里似乎忘了写纸牌的由来，现在正好写进去。这很重要，何况引证的又是像杜兰达尔德这样既严肃又可靠的人物。第四，就是确切查明了瓜迪亚纳河的发源地，这个问题到现在尚不为人所知呢。” “您说得对，”唐吉诃德说，“不过我想问一下，虽说我对上帝能否恩准您的书出版还表示怀疑，但假如他能恩准，您打算把您的书献给谁呢？” “所有能够接受我献书的达官贵人。”小伙子说。 “那不会有很多，”唐吉诃德说，“并不是他们不配，而是因为他们不愿意接受。他们觉得没有义务满足作者因其作品而应当享受的荣誉。不过，我认识的一位王子可以弥补这项缺陷，而且能弥补得甚好，如果我斗胆说出来，恐怕即使心胸再宽广的人也会嫉妒呢。可是，咱们还是先说到这儿吧，等有时间再慢慢聊。现在，咱们先去找个过夜的地方吧。” “离这儿不远的地方有座寺院，”小伙子说，“住着一位隐士，听说他当过兵。大家觉得他是个好基督徒，而且特别见多识广，心地善良。他在寺院旁边自己花钱盖了一间房子。房子虽小，毕竟能容得下几个客人。” “这位隐士也有母鸡吗？”桑乔问。 “很少有隐士不养母鸡的。”唐吉诃德说，“现在的隐士不同于埃及沙漠地带的那些隐士，穿的是棕榈叶，吃的是草根。我并不是想由此及彼，我只是想说明现在的隐士不像以前的教士那样清苦。不过，这并不等于说现在的隐士不像以前的隐士那样善良。至少我觉得他们还是善良的。如果人已经变坏了，假装善良的虚伪总比公开的罪恶强。” 他们正说着，迎面走来一个人。那人走得急，而且不时用棍子抽打一匹驮着长矛和戟的骡子，走到他们面前时，只打了个招呼，便匆匆过去了。唐吉诃德对那人说： “那位好人，请停一停。看来你走得太快了，那头骡子恐怕不一定受得了呢。” “我不能停下来，大人。”那个人说，“我带的这些兵器明天还得用呢，所以我现在不能停下来，再见吧。不过，如果你想知道我为什么要运这些东西，我打算今晚就住在过了寺院之后的那个客店里。你要是顺路，就去找我，我可以给你讲些新鲜事。现在还是再见吧。” 说完，不等唐吉诃德问他想讲什么新鲜事，他就急急地催骡走了。唐吉诃德觉得有些奇怪，而且他向来爱打听新鲜事，就吩咐立刻启程，也到那个客店，而不是去寺院光顾小伙子所说的那个隐士了。 于是三个人上了马，直奔客店，到达客店时，天色已接近傍晚。路过寺院时，小伙子曾建议唐吉诃德进去喝一杯。桑乔听到此话，立即掉转驴向寺院奔去，唐吉诃德和小伙子也跟了过去。可是命运好像跟桑乔过不去，隐士偏巧不在家，只碰到一个替隐士看家的人。三个人要向那个看家人买点贵的东西①，那人回答说主人没有贵的东西，不过，若是要便宜的水，他十分乐意提供。 “若是因为口渴，”桑乔说，“路上就有井，我喝井水就可以解渴了。” 于是他们离开寺院，催骡向客店赶去，走了不远，就发现前面有一位青年，他走得并不快，所以很快就赶上了他。青年肩上扛着剑，剑上挑着一个包袱，估计里面是短裤或肥腿裤、短斗篷、衬衣之类的衣服。他身上穿着丝绒短外套，有的地方已经磨得发亮了，衬衣也露在外面，脚上穿的是丝袜和京城当时流行的方头鞋②，年龄大约十八九岁，一张快活的脸，看样子挺机灵。他嘴里哼着塞基迪亚③解闷，走到他们面前时，正好唱完一曲。小伙子记得歌词是这样唱的： 从戎皆因贫困， 有钱决不入伍。 ①当时习惯以此来指葡萄酒。 ②据说，当时一位叫莱尔马的公爵脚孤拐很大，所以穿了一双方头鞋。于是，很多朝臣都仿效他，一时京城颇为风行方头鞋。 ③西班牙一种民间乐曲及舞蹈，歌词为四行至七行的短诗。 唐吉诃德首先同青年攀谈。唐吉诃德问他： “英俊的青年啊，看你轻装赶路，要去何方？如果你不介意，我们想知道。” 青年回答说： “轻装赶路是因为天气热和贫困，我要去投军。” “因为天气热还说得过去，”唐吉诃德说，“因为贫困是怎么回事？” “大人，”那个青年说，“我这个包袱里有几条丝绒肥腿裤和一件短外套。如果我在路上穿坏，进城时就没有像样的衣服了，我也没钱再买衣服。还有，也是为了图凉快，我才穿得这么少，等我赶到离这儿十二西里远的步兵连入伍时再把衣服都穿上。那儿有不少车马到码头去，据说码头在卡塔赫纳。我宁愿入伍为国王效劳，也不愿意在京城里伺候穷光蛋。” “您难道能得到什么赏赐吗？”小伙子问。 “若是我伺候一位西班牙的大人物，或者什么贵人，我肯定能得到赏赐。”青年人说，“伺候贵人总会有好处，仆役里往往出少尉或上尉，或者能弄到其他什么好差事。可是我不那么走运，总是伺候所谓的王位继承人或者收入菲薄的人，浆洗一条衣领就会花掉他们的一半薪俸。小听差若能挣大钱，那才是怪事呢。” “你以你的生命发誓，告诉我，朋友，”唐吉诃德问道，“你干了这么多年，难道连一套制服都没挣到吗？” “倒是给了我两套，”青年人说，“不过，就像出家人还俗之前要交还法衣，再取回自己的衣服一样，侍从们完成了在宫廷的服役后回家，制服也就收走了。制服当初只是为了装门面用的。” “就像意大利人说的，真够奸的。”唐吉诃德说，“不过，你已经离开了宫廷，壮志满怀，应当看成是走了幸运之路。世界上再没有比首先为上帝效力，其次为国王和自己的主人效劳，尤其是以习武来为他们效劳更光荣、更有益的事情了。就像我多次说过的那样，习武即使不能像从文那样有利可图，至少比从文更能赢得荣誉。尽管文人比武士建立了更多的功业，我仍然觉得武士与文人相比，有种说不出的感觉，我知道那是一种辉煌的感觉，远远超过了文人。我现在有句话要对你说，你要记在脑子里，这对你会很有益处，会减轻你的负担。这句话就是要摒弃对可能遇到不测的忧虑，因为不测再大，至多不过是一死；如果死得其所，死是最崇高的事情。 “曾经有人问那位英勇的罗马皇帝凯撒，什么是最好的死亡方式。他回答说，最好是突如其来、意想不到地死去。尽管这听起来像是一个无视上帝真正存在的异教徒的回答，却说得很对，因为这样可以免除人类心灵的痛苦。假如你在两军冲突中阵亡，或者被炮弹击中，或者被地雷炸飞，那又何妨呢？反正都是一死，一切都结束了。按照泰伦提乌斯①的说法，战死比逃生更能称得上勇士；越是服从指挥官，越是尽可能执行指挥官的命令，就越能获得优秀战士的美名。你记住，孩子，一个优秀战士身上散发出的应当是火药味，而不是香味。当你年事已高却仍然从事这项光荣使命时，即使你满身伤痕，断手瘸腿，你至少也感到一种光荣，不会因为自己的贫困而感到羞耻。况且，现在已就如何救济老弱病残士兵发布了命令。有的人嫌年老的黑奴不能干活，就借口‘解放他们’而把他们赶走，如果用这种办法来对待老弱病残的士兵就不对了，这会使他们遭受饥饿，导致死亡。这件事我现在不想再谈了，你先上来，骑在我的马屁股上。咱们一同到客店去，再同我一起吃顿晚饭吧。明天早晨你继续赶你的路，愿上帝让你如愿以偿。” ①泰伦提乌斯是古罗马喜剧家。 那个青年没有骑唐吉诃德的马屁股，不过，他同意与唐吉诃德在客店共进晚餐。据说，桑乔当时心里想： “上帝保佑我的主人吧！他刚才说了那么多，又说得那么好，可说起蒙特西诺斯洞窟的事情时，他怎么竟胡说他见到了那么多根本不可能见到的东西呢？好吧，以后再看吧。” 傍晚时分，他们到达了客店。这回桑乔有些高兴，因为他的主人没有像以住那样把客店当成城堡，而是把它当成了真正的客店。他们一进客店，唐吉诃德就向店主打听那个运送长矛和戟的人。店主说他正在马厩里安顿他的骡子呢。小伙子和桑乔也去安顿自己的驴，并且把马厩里最好的马槽和地方让给了罗西南多。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4645.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
