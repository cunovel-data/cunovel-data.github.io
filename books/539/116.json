{"id":42256,"no":116,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 62","content":"Don Quixote’s host was one Don Antonio Moreno by name, a gentleman of wealth and intelligence, and very fond of diverting himself in any fair and good-natured way; and having Don Quixote in his house he set about devising modes of making him exhibit his mad points in some harmless fashion; for jests that give pain are no jests, and no sport is worth anything if it hurts another. The first thing he did was to make Don Quixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight chamois suit we have already described and depicted more than once, out on a balcony overhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of the crowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as they would at a monkey. The cavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for him alone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it, and Sancho was in high delight, for it seemed to him that, how he knew not, he had fallen upon another Camacho’s wedding, another house like Don Diego de Miranda’s , another castle like the duke’s. Some of Don Antonio’s friends dined with him that day, and all showed honour to Don Quixote and treated him as a knight-errant, and he becoming puffed up and exalted in consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction. Such were the drolleries of Sancho that all the servants of the house, and all who heard him, were kept hanging upon his lips. While at table Don Antonio said to him, “We hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fond of manjar blanco and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, you keep them in your bosom for the next day.”\\n\\n “No, senor, that’s not true,” said Sancho, “for I am more cleanly than greedy, and my master Don Quixote here knows well that we two are used to live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts. To be sure, if it so happens that they offer me a heifer, I run with a halter; I mean, I eat what I’m given, and make use of opportunities as I find them; but whoever says that I’m an out-of-the-way eater or not cleanly, let me tell him that he is wrong; and I’d put it in a different way if I did not respect the honourable beards that are at the table.”\\n\\n “Indeed,” said Don Quixote, “Sancho’s moderation and cleanliness in eating might be inscribed and graved on plates of brass, to be kept in eternal remembrance in ages to come. It is true that when he is hungry there is a certain appearance of voracity about him, for he eats at a great pace and chews with both jaws; but cleanliness he is always mindful of; and when he was governor he learned how to eat daintily, so much so that he eats grapes, and even pomegranate pips, with a fork.”\\n\\n “What!” said Don Antonio, “has Sancho been a governor?”\\n\\n “Ay,” said Sancho, “and of an island called Barataria. I governed it to perfection for ten days; and lost my rest all the time; and learned to look down upon all the governments in the world; I got out of it by taking to flight, and fell into a pit where I gave myself up for dead, and out of which I escaped alive by a miracle.”\\n\\n Don Quixote then gave them a minute account of the whole affair of Sancho’s government, with which he greatly amused his hearers.\\n\\n On the cloth being removed Don Antonio, taking Don Quixote by the hand, passed with him into a distant room in which there was nothing in the way of furniture except a table, apparently of jasper, resting on a pedestal of the same, upon which was set up, after the fashion of the busts of the Roman emperors, a head which seemed to be of bronze. Don Antonio traversed the whole apartment with Don Quixote and walked round the table several times, and then said, “Now, Senor Don Quixote, that I am satisfied that no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut, I will tell you of one of the rarest adventures, or more properly speaking strange things, that can be imagined, on condition that you will keep what I say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy.”\\n\\n “I swear it,” said Don Quixote, “and for greater security I will put a flag-stone over it; for I would have you know, Senor Don Antonio” (he had by this time learned his name), “that you are addressing one who, though he has ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you may safely transfer whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and rely upon it that you have consigned it to the depths of silence.”\\n\\n “In reliance upon that promise,” said Don Antonio, “I will astonish you with what you shall see and hear, and relieve myself of some of the vexation it gives me to have no one to whom I can confide my secrets, for they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody.”\\n\\n Don Quixote was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of such precautions; whereupon Don Antonio taking his hand passed it over the bronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which it stood, and then said, “This head, Senor Don Quixote, has been made and fabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world ever saw, a Pole, I believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous Escotillo of whom such marvellous stories are told. He was here in my house, and for a consideration of a thousand crowns that I gave him he constructed this head, which has the property and virtue of answering whatever questions are put to its ear. He observed the points of the compass, he traced figures, he studied the stars, he watched favourable moments, and at length brought it to the perfection we shall see to-morrow, for on Fridays it is mute, and this being Friday we must wait till the next day. In the interval your worship may consider what you would like to ask it; and I know by experience that in all its answers it tells the truth.”\\n\\n Don Quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and was inclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but seeing what a short time he had to wait to test the matter, he did not choose to say anything except that he thanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a secret. They then quitted the room, Don Antonio locked the door, and they repaired to the chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled. In the meantime Sancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and accidents that had happened his master.\\n\\n That afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his armour but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him, that at that season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were left with the servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave the house. Don Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him, and on the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrote in large letters, “This is Don Quixote of La Mancha.” As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who chanced to see him, and as they read out, “This is Don Quixote of La Mancha,” Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him, called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning to Don Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to him, “Great are the privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes it known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me.”\\n\\n “True, Senor Don Quixote,” returned Don Antonio; “for as fire cannot be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and that which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above all others.”\\n\\n It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the acclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading the inscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, “The devil take thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art thou here, and not dead of the countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? Thou art mad; and if thou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, it would not be so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools and blockheads of all who have anything to do with thee or say to thee. Why, look at these gentlemen bearing thee company! Get thee home, blockhead, and see after thy affairs, and thy wife and children, and give over these fooleries that are sapping thy brains and skimming away thy wits.”\\n\\n “Go your own way, brother,” said Don Antonio, “and don’t offer advice to those who don’t ask you for it. Senor Don Quixote is in his full senses, and we who bear him company are not fools; virtue is to be honoured wherever it may be found; go, and bad luck to you, and don’t meddle where you are not wanted.”\\n\\n “By God, your worship is right,” replied the Castilian; “for to advise this good man is to kick against the pricks; still for all that it fills me with pity that the sound wit they say the blockhead has in everything should dribble away by the channel of his knight-errantry; but may the bad luck your worship talks of follow me and all my descendants, if, from this day forth, though I should live longer than Methuselah, I ever give advice to anybody even if he asks me for it.”\\n\\n The advice-giver took himself off, and they continued their stroll; but so great was the press of the boys and people to read the placard, that Don Antonio was forced to remove it as if he were taking off something else.\\n\\n \\n\\n Night came and they went home, and there was a ladies’ dancing party, for Don Antonio’s wife, a lady of rank and gaiety, beauty and wit, had invited some friends of hers to come and do honour to her guest and amuse themselves with his strange delusions. Several of them came, they supped sumptuously, the dance began at about ten o’clock. Among the ladies were two of a mischievous and frolicsome turn, and, though perfectly modest, somewhat free in playing tricks for harmless diversion sake. These two were so indefatigable in taking Don Quixote out to dance that they tired him down, not only in body but in spirit. It was a sight to see the figure Don Quixote made, long, lank, lean, and yellow, his garments clinging tight to him, ungainly, and above all anything but agile.\\n\\n \\n\\n The gay ladies made secret love to him, and he on his part secretly repelled them, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments he lifted up his voice and exclaimed, “Fugite, partes adversae! Leave me in peace, unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with your desires, ladies, for she who is queen of mine, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, suffers none but hers to lead me captive and subdue me;” and so saying he sat down on the floor in the middle of the room, tired out and broken down by all this exertion in the dance.\\n\\n Don Antonio directed him to be taken up bodily and carried to bed, and the first that laid hold of him was Sancho, saying as he did so, “In an evil hour you took to dancing, master mine; do you fancy all mighty men of valour are dancers, and all knights-errant given to capering? If you do, I can tell you you are mistaken; there’s many a man would rather undertake to kill a giant than cut a caper. If it had been the shoe-fling you were at I could take your place, for I can do the shoe-fling like a gerfalcon; but I’m no good at dancing.”\\n\\n With these and other observations Sancho set the whole ball-room laughing, and then put his master to bed, covering him up well so that he might sweat out any chill caught after his dancing.\\n\\n The next day Don Antonio thought he might as well make trial of the enchanted head, and with Don Quixote, Sancho, and two others, friends of his, besides the two ladies that had tired out Don Quixote at the ball, who had remained for the night with Don Antonio’s wife, he locked himself up in the chamber where the head was. He explained to them the property it possessed and entrusted the secret to them, telling them that now for the first time he was going to try the virtue of the enchanted head; but except Don Antonio’s two friends no one else was privy to the mystery of the enchantment, and if Don Antonio had not first revealed it to them they would have been inevitably reduced to the same state of amazement as the rest, so artfully and skilfully was it contrived.\\n\\n The first to approach the ear of the head was Don Antonio himself, and in a low voice but not so low as not to be audible to all, he said to it, “Head, tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am I at this moment thinking of?”\\n\\n The head, without any movement of the lips, answered in a clear and distinct voice, so as to be heard by all, “I cannot judge of thoughts.”\\n\\n All were thunderstruck at this, and all the more so as they saw that there was nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room that could have answered. “How many of us are here?” asked Don Antonio once more; and it was answered him in the same way softly, “Thou and thy wife, with two friends of thine and two of hers, and a famous knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha, and a squire of his, Sancho Panza by name.”\\n\\n Now there was fresh astonishment; now everyone’s hair was standing on end with awe; and Don Antonio retiring from the head exclaimed, “This suffices to show me that I have not been deceived by him who sold thee to me, O sage head, talking head, answering head, wonderful head! Let some one else go and put what question he likes to it.”\\n\\n And as women are commonly impulsive and inquisitive, the first to come forward was one of the two friends of Don Antonio’s wife, and her question was, “Tell me, Head, what shall I do to be very beautiful?” and the answer she got was, “Be very modest.”\\n\\n “I question thee no further,” said the fair querist.\\n\\n Her companion then came up and said, “I should like to know, Head, whether my husband loves me or not;” the answer given to her was, “Think how he uses thee, and thou mayest guess;” and the married lady went off saying, “That answer did not need a question; for of course the treatment one receives shows the disposition of him from whom it is received.”\\n\\n Then one of Don Antonio’s two friends advanced and asked it, “Who am I?” “Thou knowest,” was the answer. “That is not what I ask thee,” said the gentleman, “but to tell me if thou knowest me.” “Yes, I know thee, thou art Don Pedro Noriz,” was the reply.\\n\\n “I do not seek to know more,” said the gentleman, “for this is enough to convince me, O Head, that thou knowest everything;” and as he retired the other friend came forward and asked it, “Tell me, Head, what are the wishes of my eldest son?”\\n\\n “I have said already,” was the answer, “that I cannot judge of wishes; however, I can tell thee the wish of thy son is to bury thee.”\\n\\n “That’s ‘what I see with my eyes I point out with my finger,’” said the gentleman, “so I ask no more.”\\n\\n Don Antonio’s wife came up and said, “I know not what to ask thee, Head; I would only seek to know of thee if I shall have many years of enjoyment of my good husband;” and the answer she received was, “Thou shalt, for his vigour and his temperate habits promise many years of life, which by their intemperance others so often cut short.”\\n\\n Then Don Quixote came forward and said, “Tell me, thou that answerest, was that which I describe as having happened to me in the cave of Montesinos the truth or a dream? Will Sancho’s whipping be accomplished without fail? Will the disenchantment of Dulcinea be brought about?”\\n\\n \\n\\n “As to the question of the cave,” was the reply, “there is much to be said; there is something of both in it. Sancho’s whipping will proceed leisurely. The disenchantment of Dulcinea will attain its due consummation.”\\n\\n “I seek to know no more,” said Don Quixote; “let me but see Dulcinea disenchanted, and I will consider that all the good fortune I could wish for has come upon me all at once.”\\n\\n The last questioner was Sancho, and his questions were, “Head, shall I by any chance have another government? Shall I ever escape from the hard life of a squire? Shall I get back to see my wife and children?” To which the answer came, “Thou shalt govern in thy house; and if thou returnest to it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing to serve thou shalt cease to be a squire.”\\n\\n “Good, by God!” said Sancho Panza; “I could have told myself that; the prophet Perogrullo could have said no more.”\\n\\n “What answer wouldst thou have, beast?” said Don Quixote; “is it not enough that the replies this head has given suit the questions put to it?”\\n\\n “Yes, it is enough,” said Sancho; “but I should have liked it to have made itself plainer and told me more.”\\n\\n The questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder with which all were filled, except Don Antonio’s two friends who were in the secret. This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once, not to keep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strange magical mystery in it. He says, therefore, that on the model of another head, the work of an image maker, which he had seen at Madrid, Don Antonio made this one at home for his own amusement and to astonish ignorant people; and its mechanism was as follows. The table was of wood painted and varnished to imitate jasper, and the pedestal on which it stood was of the same material, with four eagles’ claws projecting from it to support the weight more steadily. The head, which resembled a bust or figure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured like bronze, was hollow throughout, as was the table, into which it was fitted so exactly that no trace of the joining was visible. The pedestal of the table was also hollow and communicated with the throat and neck of the head, and the whole was in communication with another room underneath the chamber in which the head stood. Through the entire cavity in the pedestal, table, throat and neck of the bust or figure, there passed a tube of tin carefully adjusted and concealed from sight. In the room below corresponding to the one above was placed the person who was to answer, with his mouth to the tube, and the voice, as in an ear-trumpet, passed from above downwards, and from below upwards, the words coming clearly and distinctly; it was impossible, thus, to detect the trick. A nephew of Don Antonio’s , a smart sharp-witted student, was the answerer, and as he had been told beforehand by his uncle who the persons were that would come with him that day into the chamber where the head was, it was an easy matter for him to answer the first question at once and correctly; the others he answered by guess-work, and, being clever, cleverly. Cide Hamete adds that this marvellous contrivance stood for some ten or twelve days; but that, as it became noised abroad through the city that he had in his house an enchanted head that answered all who asked questions of it, Don Antonio, fearing it might come to the ears of the watchful sentinels of our faith, explained the matter to the inquisitors, who commanded him to break it up and have done with it, lest the ignorant vulgar should be scandalised. By Don Quixote, however, and by Sancho the head was still held to be an enchanted one, and capable of answering questions, though more to Don Quixote’s satisfaction than Sancho’s.\\n\\n The gentlemen of the city, to gratify Don Antonio and also to do the honours to Don Quixote, and give him an opportunity of displaying his folly, made arrangements for a tilting at the ring in six days from that time, which, however, for reason that will be mentioned hereafter, did not take place.\\n\\n Don Quixote took a fancy to stroll about the city quietly and on foot, for he feared that if he went on horseback the boys would follow him; so he and Sancho and two servants that Don Antonio gave him set out for a walk. Thus it came to pass that going along one of the streets Don Quixote lifted up his eyes and saw written in very large letters over a door, “Books printed here,” at which he was vastly pleased, for until then he had never seen a printing office, and he was curious to know what it was like. He entered with all his following, and saw them drawing sheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up type here, revising there; in short all the work that is to be seen in great printing offices. He went up to one case and asked what they were about there; the workmen told him, he watched them with wonder, and passed on. He approached one man, among others, and asked him what he was doing. The workman replied, “Senor, this gentleman here” (pointing to a man of prepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look) “has translated an Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am setting it up in type for the press.”\\n\\n “What is the title of the book?” asked Don Quixote; to which the author replied, “Senor, in Italian the book is called Le Bagatelle.”\\n\\n “And what does Le Bagatelle import in our Spanish?” asked Don Quixote.\\n\\n “Le Bagatelle,” said the author, “is as though we should say in Spanish Los Juguetes; but though the book is humble in name it has good solid matter in it.”\\n\\n “I,” said Don Quixote, “have some little smattering of Italian, and I plume myself on singing some of Ariosto’s stanzas; but tell me, senor — I do not say this to test your ability, but merely out of curiosity — have you ever met with the word pignatta in your book?”\\n\\n “Yes, often,” said the author.\\n\\n “And how do you render that in Spanish?”\\n\\n “How should I render it,” returned the author, “but by olla?”\\n\\n “Body o’ me,” exclaimed Don Quixote, “what a proficient you are in the Italian language! I would lay a good wager that where they say in Italian piace you say in Spanish place, and where they say piu you say mas, and you translate su by arriba and giu by abajo.”\\n\\n “I translate them so of course,” said the author, “for those are their proper equivalents.”\\n\\n “I would venture to swear,” said Don Quixote, “that your worship is not known in the world, which always begrudges their reward to rare wits and praiseworthy labours. What talents lie wasted there! What genius thrust away into corners! What worth left neglected! Still it seems to me that translation from one language into another, if it be not from the queens of languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking at Flemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are visible, they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they do not show with the smoothness and brightness of the right side; and translation from easy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command of words, any more than transcribing or copying out one document from another. But I do not mean by this to draw the inference that no credit is to be allowed for the work of translating, for a man may employ himself in ways worse and less profitable to himself. This estimate does not include two famous translators, Doctor Cristobal de Figueroa, in his Pastor Fido, and Don Juan de Jauregui, in his Aminta, wherein by their felicity they leave it in doubt which is the translation and which the original. But tell me, are you printing this book at your own risk, or have you sold the copyright to some bookseller?”\\n\\n “I print at my own risk,” said the author, “and I expect to make a thousand ducats at least by this first edition, which is to be of two thousand copies that will go off in a twinkling at six reals apiece.”\\n\\n “A fine calculation you are making!” said Don Quixote; “it is plain you don’t know the ins and outs of the printers, and how they play into one another’s hands. I promise you when you find yourself saddled with two thousand copies you will feel so sore that it will astonish you, particularly if the book is a little out of the common and not in any way highly spiced.”\\n\\n “What!” said the author, “would your worship, then, have me give it to a bookseller who will give three maravedis for the copyright and think he is doing me a favour? I do not print my books to win fame in the world, for I am known in it already by my works; I want to make money, without which reputation is not worth a rap.”\\n\\n “God send your worship good luck,” said Don Quixote; and he moved on to another case, where he saw them correcting a sheet of a book with the title of “Light of the Soul;” noticing it he observed, “Books like this, though there are many of the kind, are the ones that deserve to be printed, for many are the sinners in these days, and lights unnumbered are needed for all that are in darkness.”\\n\\n He passed on, and saw they were also correcting another book, and when he asked its title they told him it was called, “The Second Part of the Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha,” by one of Tordesillas.\\n\\n “I have heard of this book already,” said Don Quixote, “and verily and on my conscience I thought it had been by this time burned to ashes as a meddlesome intruder; but its Martinmas will come to it as it does to every pig; for fictions have the more merit and charm about them the more nearly they approach the truth or what looks like it; and true stories, the truer they are the better they are;” and so saying he walked out of the printing office with a certain amount of displeasure in his looks. That same day Don Antonio arranged to take him to see the galleys that lay at the beach, whereat Sancho was in high delight, as he had never seen any all his life. Don Antonio sent word to the commandant of the galleys that he intended to bring his guest, the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, of whom the commandant and all the citizens had already heard, that afternoon to see them; and what happened on board of them will be told in the next chapter.\\n\\n \\n\\n 唐吉诃德的东道主叫安东尼奥·莫雷诺，是个富裕而又精明的绅士，喜欢开一些并不粗俗的善意的玩笑。他见唐吉诃德来到了他家，就想让大家拿唐吉诃德的疯癫开心，但是又不伤害唐吉诃德的自尊心。刺伤了人的自尊心就算不上玩笑了，哪怕是伤害第三者也称不上是娱乐。他做的第一件事就是让唐吉诃德脱去盔甲，仅穿着我们在前面叙述过的那件羚羊皮紧身背心，走到一个面对该城主要大街的阳台上去，让众多大人和孩子像看猴子似的看他。唐吉诃德面前又出现了许多穿艳丽服装的骑马人，他们跑来跑去仿佛不是为了庆祝当天的节日，而是专门供唐吉诃德检阅似的。桑乔特别高兴，竟莫名其妙地以为又碰上了一次卡马乔的婚礼，又到了一个像唐迭戈·德米兰达那样的宅第，又出现了一个像公爵府那样的城堡。\\n\\n 那天，安东尼奥请几个朋友吃饭，大家对唐吉诃德都很尊重，把他当游侠骑士对待。唐吉诃德自然得意洋洋，喜形于色。桑乔更是妙语连珠，吸引了所有佣人和能听到他讲话的人，席间安东尼奥对桑乔说：\\n\\n “好桑乔，我们听说你特别喜欢吃米粉牛奶杏仁羹和丸子，如果吃不完，你还藏到怀里留着第二天吃。”\\n\\n “并不是这样，大人。”桑乔说，“我很爱干净，并不那么贪吃。我的主人唐吉诃德就在旁边，他十分清楚，有时候一把橡子或胡桃就够我们俩吃八天。的确，也有可能遇到人家给我一头小牛，我马上就拿绳去牵的情况，我的意思是说，有什么我就吃什么，有机会就不放过。可是，无论谁说我贪吃或者不讲卫生，你们都千万别信。若不是有诸位贵宾在席，这话我还会另有说法呢。”\\n\\n “的确如此，”唐吉诃德说，“桑乔的克制和讲卫生真值得载入史册，供后人怀念。他饿的时候确实有点儿贪吃，吃得既快又狼吞虎咽，不过他一直很注意卫生。他当总督的时候吃东西就很文雅，曾经用叉子吃葡萄和石榴子。”\\n\\n “怎么，”安东尼奥说，“桑乔还当过总督？”\\n\\n “是的，”桑乔说，“我当过一个叫巴拉塔里亚的海岛的总督。我痛痛快快地当了十天总督。后来我失去了耐心，开始鄙视世界上的所有总督，于是就从那儿逃了出来，结果掉进了一个大坑。我以为我要死在那儿了，可是却奇迹般地活了下来。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德把桑乔当总督的事情详细地叙述了一遍，众人听得津津有味。\\n\\n 吃完饭后，安东尼奥拉着唐吉诃德的手来到一个单独的房间。房间里只有一张桌子，看样子是碧玉的；桌子只有一条桌腿，也是碧玉的。桌子上摆放着两个罗马皇帝的半身像，大概是用青铜制的。安东尼奥带着唐吉诃德绕桌子转了几圈，然后才说道：\\n\\n “唐吉诃德大人，我已经察看过了，现在没有任何人看见咱们或者听见咱们说话，门也关上了。我想告诉您一件最罕见的奇闻，或者说是一件难以想象的新闻，不过我有个条件，那就是您得严守秘密。”\\n\\n “我发誓，”唐吉诃德说，“为了更保险起见，我还可以在严守秘密之上再压一块石头。”唐吉诃德现在已经知道了安东尼奥的名字，又说道，“而且我想告诉您，安东尼奥大人，我只有耳朵往里进，没有嘴往外传。所以您尽可放心，心里有什么事都完全可以告诉我，就算是把秘密扔到沉默的深渊里去了。”\\n\\n “既然您这么说，”安东尼奥说，“我可要让您对您的所见所闻大吃一惊了。这也算是我的一种排遣吧。这件事我一直无处可讲，它并不是随便可以和任何人讲的。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德觉得很好奇，等着安东尼奥到底说什么。这时，安东尼奥抓着唐吉诃德的手，把那青铜像、那碧玉桌子以及那条桌腿都摸了一遍，然后才说道：\\n\\n “唐吉诃德大人，这个头像是由世界上最优秀的魔法师制作的。那个魔法师大概是波兰人。他是著名的埃斯科蒂略的门徒，关于他有很多神奇的传说。那个魔法师就在我家住过。我出价一千个盾，请他制作了这个头像。您靠近头像的耳朵随便问什么问题，他都能回答。那位魔法师画符念咒，观象掐算，让这个头像具备了这种特异功能。明天，咱们可以试试看。星期五这个头像不说话，而今天恰好是星期五，所以咱们得等到明天。在这段时间里您可以准备一下要提的问题。\\n\\n 根据我的经验，它回答得都很准确。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德听说头像有这种特异功能，感到非常惊奇，对安东尼奥的话不太相信。不过，既然过不了多长时间就可以试验，他也就不想再说什么了，只是对安东尼奥如此推心置腹表示感谢。两人走出房间，安东尼奥用钥匙把门锁好。两人来到客厅，其他人仍在那里听桑乔讲他和他主人的种种奇遇。\\n\\n 当天下午，他们陪唐吉诃德外出散步。唐吉诃德没有穿盔甲，一身休闲装束，穿着棕黄色的长袍。当时，那样的天气穿长袍，即使是冰块也要冒汗的。安东尼奥吩咐佣人们与桑乔周旋，别让他出门。唐吉诃德出了门，他没有骑罗西南多，而是骑着一匹高大、驯顺的骡子，并且鞍具也很漂亮。他们让唐吉诃德穿上长袍，并且在长袍背部悄悄地贴了一张羊皮纸，上面用大字写着：“这就是曼查的唐吉诃德。”他们开始在街上走动，这张羊皮纸吸引了过往行人的注意力。大家念着“这就是曼查的唐吉诃德”。唐吉诃德见有很多人看他，说得出他的名字，认出了他，甚觉惊讶。他转过身对身旁的安东尼奥说：\\n\\n “游侠骑士就是与众不同，它可以使人名扬天下。不信，您看看，安东尼奥大人，这个城市这么多人，甚至包括许多孩子，他们根本没见过我，却能够认出我来。”\\n\\n “是这样，唐吉诃德大人。”安东尼奥说，“这就如同火不可能被包藏一样，功德也不可能被湮没。游侠骑士道永远辉煌，功盖四方。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德正走着，忽然有个卡斯蒂利亚人看到了唐吉诃德背上的羊皮纸，高声说道：\\n\\n “见鬼去吧，曼查的唐吉诃德！你挨了那么多棍子，居然没死，又跑到这儿来了！你是个疯子！如果你只是在自己家里疯，那还好点儿，可是你还要把跟你交往的人都变得疯疯癫癫的，否则，为什么会有这么多大人跟着你？你还是趁早回家去吧，笨蛋，照顾好你的财产，照顾好你的老婆孩子，别再鬼迷心窍，疯疯癫癫啦。”\\n\\n “兄弟，”安东尼奥说，“你还是走你的路吧。别人没向你请教，你也就不必为别人操心了。唐吉诃德大人非常明智，我们这些陪着他的人也不傻。品德高尚的人到处都应该受到尊重。你别自找倒霉了，没叫你来，你就别搀和。”\\n\\n “不错，您说得对，”那个卡斯蒂利亚人说，“劝说这种人等于对牛弹琴。让我遗憾的是，据说这个笨蛋在各方面都很聪明，只是让游侠骑士的疯癫给毁了。从今以后，我谁也不劝了，即使我能长命百岁，即使别人向我讨教，我也不管了，否则就像您说的那样，让我和我的后代倒霉透顶！”\\n\\n 那人说完就走了，大家又继续在街上闲逛。可是，总有很多大人和小孩挤着念那张纸。安东尼奥只好假装给唐吉诃德掸什么东西，把那张纸条取了下来。\\n\\n 傍晚，他们回到安东尼奥的家，正好赶上一个贵妇舞会。原来，安东尼奥的夫人是个高贵而又快活、美丽而又聪明的女人，她邀请了很多女伴一起来招待客人，同时也想拿唐吉诃德的疯癫开开心。因此，到了几位女客，大家共进了一顿丰盛的晚餐。舞会在晚上十点左右开始。来客中有两位喜欢恶作剧的夫人。她们虽然是正派人，但若是开起无恶意的玩笑来，就显得有些放肆了。她们请唐吉诃德拼命地跳舞，折腾得唐吉诃德不仅身体很累，精神上也感到很疲惫。这从唐吉诃德那副又细又高、又瘦又黄、衣服紧裹在身上、萎靡不振、毫不感到轻松的样子就可以看出来。两位夫人悄悄地向唐吉诃德暗送秋波，唐吉诃德也悄悄地予以蔑视。后来，唐吉诃德见两位夫人的攻势越来越紧，便提高嗓门说道：“滚开，我的敌手！不要再来纠缠我！你们还是知趣些吧，托博索无与伦比的杜尔西内亚才是我心上的皇后，其他任何人都不可能征服我的心！”\\n\\n 说完，他就坐在了大厅中央的地面上，此时，他已跳得浑身像散了架似的。安东尼奥赶紧叫人把他背到床上去。桑乔首先抢上来抓着唐吉诃德说：\\n\\n “您跳什么舞呀，我的大人，真是自找倒霉！您以为所有的勇士都能跳舞，所有的游侠骑士都是舞蹈家吗？我是说，您如果真这么想，那就是自欺欺人。有的人宁愿去杀一个巨人，也不愿意蹦蹦跳跳。若论蹦蹦跳跳，我完全可以代替您，我跳得好极了。可要是跳正经的舞蹈，我就一点儿也摸不着门了。”\\n\\n 桑乔这些话把舞会上的人都逗乐了。桑乔把唐吉诃德弄到床上，给他盖好被子，以免他因为跳舞出汗而着凉。\\n\\n 第二天，安东尼奥觉得可以做通灵头像的试验了。他同唐吉诃德、桑乔、另外两位朋友以及那两个在舞会上把唐吉诃德累得够呛的夫人一起，来到安放头像的房间。两位夫人在舞会当晚留宿在安东尼奥夫人那儿了。安东尼奥向他们讲述了头像的特异功能，并嘱咐大家一定保密，还说这是第一次验证这种功能。除了安东尼奥的两位朋友，其他人都不知道这件事的实情。如果不是安东尼奥事先把这件事告诉了那两位朋友，他们也会像其他人一样惊讶不已的。由此可见，一切都安排得井井有条。\\n\\n 安东尼奥首先凑近头像的耳朵，低声提问。声音虽然低，可是在场的人都能听到。安东尼奥问：\\n\\n “头像啊，凭着你的本领，告诉我，我现在在想什么？”\\n\\n 头像的嘴唇并没有动，可是说话的声音却很清晰，屋里的人都能听清楚。头像说：\\n\\n “我不管别人想什么。”\\n\\n 听到这声音，大家都很惊奇，因为在整个房间里，包括桌子底下，都没看见有答话的人。\\n\\n “我们一共有多少人？”安东尼奥又问。\\n\\n 头像回答的声音仍然那样低沉：\\n\\n “你和你夫人，还有你的两个朋友，你夫人的两个朋友，曼查的一位叫唐吉诃德的著名骑士，以及他的名叫桑乔的侍从。”\\n\\n 大家更加吃惊，惊得头发都直立起来了。安东尼奥离开头像，说道：\\n\\n “这足以证明，我并没有受那个把头像卖给我的人欺骗。多么聪明的头像啊，会说话的头像，还能回答问题，多么神奇啊！现在换换人吧，谁想问什么都可以。”\\n\\n 女人们一般都好奇，爱打听，安东尼奥夫人的两位女伴中有一个人问道：\\n\\n “告诉我，头像，我怎样做才能变得更漂亮？”\\n\\n 头像回答说：\\n\\n “人得正派。”\\n\\n “我不问别的了。”那位夫人说。\\n\\n 另一位夫人也过去问，她说：\\n\\n “头像，我想知道，我丈夫是否真心爱我。”\\n\\n 头像回答说：\\n\\n “这要看他的行动才能清楚。”\\n\\n 这位夫人走到一旁说：\\n\\n “这不算回答。一个人的行动当然能表现出他的心思。”\\n\\n 安东尼奥的一位朋友走过去问道：\\n\\n “我是谁？”\\n\\n 头像回答说：\\n\\n “你自己知道。”\\n\\n “我不是问这个，”安东尼奥的这位朋友说，“我问的是你是否认识我？”\\n\\n “是的，我认识你，”头像答道，“你是唐佩德罗·诺里斯。”\\n\\n “我不想再问其他事情了，知道这些就够了。噢，头像，你真是无所不知！”\\n\\n 安东尼奥的另一位朋友也走过去问道：\\n\\n “告诉我，头像，我的大儿子现在想干什么？”\\n\\n “我已经说过了，”头像说，“我不管别人想干什么。不过，尽管如此，我还是可以告诉你，你的大儿子想埋葬你。”\\n\\n “真是这样，”安东尼奥的那位朋友说，“我确实亲眼见到，亲身体会到了。”\\n\\n 他不再问什么了。安东尼奥的夫人又走过去问道：\\n\\n “头像，我不知道我该问你什么，我只想让你告诉我，我的好丈夫是否能陪伴我多年。”\\n\\n “是的，能够陪伴你多年，因为你起居有节，可以长寿。\\n\\n 放纵的生活常常缩短人的生命。”\\n\\n 接着，唐吉诃德走过去问道：\\n\\n “请你告诉我，答话人，我讲述的在蒙特西诺斯洞窟里遇到的那些事，究竟是真的还是在做梦？我的侍从桑乔应该受鞭笞，确有其事吗？这能够解脱附在杜尔西内亚身上的魔法吗？”\\n\\n “关于洞窟的情况，”头像回答说，“得视情况而定，两种可能性都有。桑乔受鞭笞的事得慢慢来。只要鞭打够了数量，杜尔西内亚就可以摆脱魔法。”\\n\\n “就这些，”唐吉诃德说，“只要能看到杜尔西内亚摆脱魔法，我就会好运从天降，心想事成。”\\n\\n 最后问话的是桑乔。桑乔问道：\\n\\n “头像，我还能当总督吗？我能摆脱侍从的苦差吗？我还能见到我的老婆和孩子吗？”\\n\\n 头像回答说：\\n\\n “你只能当你们家的总督。只要你回家，就可以见到你的老婆和孩子，也不用再服侍别人，当侍从这份苦差了。”\\n\\n “说得多妙呀，”桑乔说，“这话我也会说，连预言家佩罗格鲁略①也会说这些！”\\n\\n ①佩罗格鲁略是传说中的滑头预言家。\\n\\n “畜生，”唐吉诃德说，“你还想怎么回答你？头像有问必答，这还不够吗？”\\n\\n “够了，”桑乔说，“不过，我想让它说得再清楚点儿，再多说点儿。”\\n\\n 问答结束了。除了安东尼奥那两位知情的朋友，大家都感到很惊奇。锡德·哈迈德·贝嫩赫利为了不让大家感到惊奇，后来解释说，一定是某个魔法师在头像的脑袋里安了什么东西。据说，这个头像是安东尼奥·莫雷诺按照他在马德里看到的一个巧匠制作的另一个头像仿造的。安东尼奥把它放在家里聊以解闷或者蒙骗无知的人。头像的制作过程是这样的：先做个木头桌子，经过涂漆刷釉，让它看起来像是碧玉做的。桌腿也采用了同样的方法，而且还从桌腿里伸出四只魔爪来，这样桌子就更稳当了。头像做成某个罗马皇帝的样子，颜色涂成青铜色，里面是空心的。桌面也是空心的，把头像镶嵌在桌子上，连接得天衣无缝，一点儿破绽都看不出来。桌子腿同样是空心的，与头像的喉咙和胸部衔接，然后通过头像下面的一个小房间与另外一个房间相通。一根铁皮管子把桌腿、桌面、头像胸部和喉咙部分贯通起来，可谓珠联璧合，任何人也不会察觉。在与房间相通的下层那个小房间里，答话的人把嘴贴在铁皮管上，把铁皮管当成传话筒，声音由下到上，再由上到下，话语连贯清晰，谁也不会发现其中的奥秘。安东尼奥有个侄子，是个机灵而又聪明的学生，答话的就是他。他事先已经知道有哪些人同他叔叔在放头像的房间里，所以很容易就迅速准确地回答了第一个问题，其他问题则靠他的聪明机智来猜测作答。\\n\\n 锡德·哈迈德还说，这个神奇的头像此后只存在了十天或十二天。原来，城里立刻就传开了，说安东尼奥家里有个通灵头像，能够有问必答。没想到这件事被警觉的宗教卫士知道了，他们把这件事报告了宗教裁判所。宗教裁判所下令毁掉头像，以免那些无知的百姓大惊小怪。不过，唐吉诃德和桑乔仍然认为那头像通灵，因此能回答问题。而且，唐吉诃德对头像比桑乔更为满意。\\n\\n 城里的绅士们为了讨好安东尼奥，庆贺唐吉诃德的到来，同时也为了让唐吉诃德的疯癫多出点洋相，决定在六天后举行一次跑马穿环比赛，但是由于下面发生的事情，这次比赛未能如期举行。唐吉诃德想在城里的大街上随便逛逛。他担心如果骑马，后面又会有很多孩子跟着，就和桑乔以及安东尼奥派给他的两名佣人一起步行出了门。走到一条大街上，唐吉诃德抬头望去，看到一扇门上有个大字招牌，上面写着：“承印书籍”。唐吉诃德非常高兴，因为他从未见过印刷厂，想看看到底是怎么回事。他和他的一行人走过去，看到这儿在印刷，那儿在校样，有的人排版，有的人校改，反正都是大印刷厂里那一套。唐吉诃德走到一个大字盘前，问排字工人在干什么。工人们做了解释，唐吉诃德觉得很新鲜，然后又继续往前走。他又来到一个排字工人面前，问他在干什么。那工人答道：\\n\\n “大人，”他指着一位相貌端正、神情严肃的人说，“这位大人已经把一本托斯卡纳语的书译成了西班牙文，我们正在排版，准备印刷。”\\n\\n “这本书的书名叫什么？”唐吉诃德问。\\n\\n 那个译者答道：\\n\\n “大人，这本托斯卡纳语的书名原文叫Le　Bagatelle。”\\n\\n “Le　Bagatelle译成西班牙文是什么意思？”唐吉诃德问。\\n\\n “Le　Bagatelle就相当于我们西班牙语的‘小玩意儿’，”译者说，“虽然从书名看，这本书很普通，但是内容很好，很深刻。”\\n\\n “我懂得一点儿托斯卡纳语，而且常为自己能念几段阿里奥斯托的诗而自豪。不过大人，我想请教您一点儿事。我这样做并不是想考验您的才智，而是出于个人好奇。您在您的译作里是否遇到过pinata这个词？”\\n\\n “经常遇到。”译者说。\\n\\n “那么，您把它译成西班牙文的哪个词呢？”唐吉诃德问。\\n\\n “译成哪个词？”译者说，“只能译成‘锅’嘛。”\\n\\n “谢天谢地！”唐吉诃德说，“您对托斯卡纳语真是太精通了！我敢跟您打个大赌，托斯卡纳语中的piace，您一定译成了西班牙文的‘喜欢’，凡是遇到più，您都说成是‘多’，把su当作‘上面’，而giù是‘下面’。”\\n\\n “是这样，”译者说，“这正是这几个词的本义。”\\n\\n “我敢发誓，”唐吉诃德说，“您不是当代的著名人士，而且，您反对褒扬才子佳人和传世佳作。有多少有本领的人被埋没，有多少天才被打入冷宫！有多少道德高尚的人没有得到应有的称赞！尽管如此，我觉得把一种语言翻译成另外一种语言，除非原文是像希腊语和拉丁语那样的经典语言，否则，都会像从背面看佛兰德的挂毯一样，虽然图案看得见，可是底线太多，使得图案黯然失色，失去了作品的原有光彩。至于翻译其他一些简单的语言，更会失去才华和文采，就像只是生搬硬套过来或者只是从一张纸抄到另一张纸上一样。我并不是因此就说翻译这个行业一无是处，因为其他一些职业的情况比这个行当还糟糕，而且收益也少呢。可是有两个著名译者不在此列，一个是克里斯托瓦尔·德菲格罗亚，他翻译了《忠实牧人》；另一个是胡安·德豪雷吉，他翻译了《阿明塔》。他们的译文流畅，让人难分原作和译作。不过，请您告诉我，您这本书是自费印刷还是已经把版权卖给了某个书商？”\\n\\n “我这是自费印刷。”译者说，“我估计，这第一版至少可以赚一千个盾。这一版大约印两千册，每册卖六个雷阿尔，我估计很快就可以销完。”\\n\\n “您盘算得不错。”唐吉诃德说，“这说明你很不了解印刷厂商的花招和他们之间的关系。我敢肯定，您背着两千册书，累得腰酸腿疼的时候，您就慌了，如果这是平淡无奇的书就尤为如此。”\\n\\n “什么？”译者说，“您想让我把这本书交给书商吗？他们买我的版权只出三个马拉维迪，还以为是对我开恩呢。我印书并不是为了成名，我的作品已经有名声了。我只是想得一点儿利，没有利，空名不值半文钱。”\\n\\n “但愿上帝能让您一本万利。”唐吉诃德说。\\n\\n 唐吉诃德走到一个字盘前，看到那儿正在校改一部清样，书名是《灵魂之光》。唐吉诃德说：\\n\\n “这类书虽然已经出了很多，但还是应该再出版。现在有罪孽的人太多，需要有很多光明来指引他们。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德又继续往前走，看到人们正在校改另外一本书。他问书名叫什么，那些人告诉他是《唐吉诃德》的下卷，是托德西利亚斯附近的某某人著的。\\n\\n “我听说过这本书，”唐吉诃德说，“说句良心话，我觉得真应该把这本荒谬的书付之一炬烧成灰。不过，是猪总免不了挨刀子，虚构的故事编得越真实或者越像真的才越好，而真实的故事当然也是更真实才更好。”\\n\\n 说完，唐吉诃德满面不悦地走出印刷厂。那天，安东尼奥已经安排了他们去参观海边的几条船。桑乔没见过船，所以特别高兴。安东尼奥通知四船船队①的指挥官，说他的客人唐吉诃德下午要去参观船队。船队的人员和周围的居民都听说过唐吉诃德，有关唐吉诃德在船上的事情请看下章。\\n\\n ①每四艘船为一个船队。\\n\\n \\n\\n
