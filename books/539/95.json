{"id":42235,"no":95,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 41","content":"And now night came, and with it the appointed time for the arrival of the famous horse Clavileno, the non-appearance of which was already beginning to make Don Quixote uneasy, for it struck him that, as Malambruno was so long about sending it, either he himself was not the knight for whom the adventure was reserved, or else Malambruno did not dare to meet him in single combat. But lo! suddenly there came into the garden four wild-men all clad in green ivy bearing on their shoulders a great wooden horse. They placed it on its feet on the ground, and one of the wild-men said, “Let the knight who has heart for it mount this machine.” Here Sancho exclaimed, “I don’t mount, for neither have I the heart nor am I a knight.” “And let the squire, if he has one,” continued the wild-man, “take his seat on the croup, and let him trust the valiant Malambruno; for by no sword save his, nor by the malice of any other, shall he be assailed. It is but to turn this peg the horse has in his neck, and he will bear them through the air to where Malambruno awaits them; but lest the vast elevation of their course should make them giddy, their eyes must be covered until the horse neighs, which will be the sign of their having completed their journey.” With these words, leaving Clavileno behind them, they retired with easy dignity the way they came. As soon as the Distressed One saw the horse, almost in tears she exclaimed to Don Quixote, “Valiant knight, the promise of Malambruno has proved trustworthy; the horse has come, our beards are growing, and by every hair in them all of us implore thee to shave and shear us, as it is only mounting him with thy squire and making a happy beginning with your new journey.” “That I will, Senora Countess Trifaldi,” said Don Quixote, “most gladly and with right goodwill, without stopping to take a cushion or put on my spurs, so as not to lose time, such is my desire to see you and all these duennas shaved clean.” “That I won’t,” said Sancho, “with good-will or bad-will, or any way at all; and if this shaving can’t be done without my mounting on the croup, my master had better look out for another squire to go with him, and these ladies for some other way of making their faces smooth; I’m no witch to have a taste for travelling through the air. What would my islanders say when they heard their governor was going, strolling about on the winds? And another thing, as it is three thousand and odd leagues from this to Kandy, if the horse tires, or the giant takes huff, we’ll he half a dozen years getting back, and there won’t be isle or island in the world that will know me: and so, as it is a common saying ‘in delay there’s danger,’ and ‘when they offer thee a heifer run with a halter,’ these ladies’ beards must excuse me; ‘Saint Peter is very well in Rome;’ I mean I am very well in this house where so much is made of me, and I hope for such a good thing from the master as to see myself a governor.” “Friend Sancho,” said the duke at this, “the island that I have promised you is not a moving one, or one that will run away; it has roots so deeply buried in the bowels of the earth that it will be no easy matter to pluck it up or shift it from where it is; you know as well as I do that there is no sort of office of any importance that is not obtained by a bribe of some kind, great or small; well then, that which I look to receive for this government is that you go with your master Don Quixote, and bring this memorable adventure to a conclusion; and whether you return on Clavileno as quickly as his speed seems to promise, or adverse fortune brings you back on foot travelling as a pilgrim from hostel to hostel and from inn to inn, you will always find your island on your return where you left it, and your islanders with the same eagerness they have always had to receive you as their governor, and my good-will will remain the same; doubt not the truth of this, Senor Sancho, for that would be grievously wronging my disposition to serve you.” “Say no more, senor,” said Sancho; “I am a poor squire and not equal to carrying so much courtesy; let my master mount; bandage my eyes and commit me to God’s care, and tell me if I may commend myself to our Lord or call upon the angels to protect me when we go towering up there.” To this the Trifaldi made answer, “Sancho, you may freely commend yourself to God or whom you will; for Malambruno though an enchanter is a Christian, and works his enchantments with great circumspection, taking very good care not to fall out with anyone.” “Well then,” said Sancho, “God and the most holy Trinity of Gaeta give me help!” “Since the memorable adventure of the fulling mills,” said Don Quixote, “I have never seen Sancho in such a fright as now; were I as superstitious as others his abject fear would cause me some little trepidation of spirit. But come here, Sancho, for with the leave of these gentles I would say a word or two to thee in private;” and drawing Sancho aside among the trees of the garden and seizing both his hands he said, “Thou seest, brother Sancho, the long journey we have before us, and God knows when we shall return, or what leisure or opportunities this business will allow us; I wish thee therefore to retire now to thy chamber, as though thou wert going to fetch something required for the road, and in a trice give thyself if it be only five hundred lashes on account of the three thousand three hundred to which thou art bound; it will be all to the good, and to make a beginning with a thing is to have it half finished.” “By God,” said Sancho, “but your worship must be out of your senses! This is like the common saying, ‘You see me with child, and you want me a virgin.’ Just as I’m about to go sitting on a bare board, your worship would have me score my backside! Indeed, your worship is not reasonable. Let us be off to shave these duennas; and on our return I promise on my word to make such haste to wipe off all that’s due as will satisfy your worship; I can’t say more.” “Well, I will comfort myself with that promise, my good Sancho,” replied Don Quixote, “and I believe thou wilt keep it; for indeed though stupid thou art veracious.” “I’m not voracious,” said Sancho, “only peckish; but even if I was a little, still I’d keep my word.” With this they went back to mount Clavileno, and as they were about to do so Don Quixote said, “Cover thine eyes, Sancho, and mount; for one who sends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to deceive us for the sake of the paltry glory to be derived from deceiving persons who trust in him; though all should turn out the contrary of what I hope, no malice will be able to dim the glory of having undertaken this exploit.” “Let us be off, senor,” said Sancho, “for I have taken the beards and tears of these ladies deeply to heart, and I shan’t eat a bit to relish it until I have seen them restored to their former smoothness. Mount, your worship, and blindfold yourself, for if I am to go on the croup, it is plain the rider in the saddle must mount first.” “That is true,” said Don Quixote, and, taking a handkerchief out of his pocket, he begged the Distressed One to bandage his eyes very carefully; but after having them bandaged he uncovered them again, saying, “If my memory does not deceive me, I have read in Virgil of the Palladium of Troy, a wooden horse the Greeks offered to the goddess Pallas, which was big with armed knights, who were afterwards the destruction of Troy; so it would he as well to see, first of all, what Clavileno has in his stomach.” “There is no occasion,” said the Distressed One; “I will be bail for him, and I know that Malambruno has nothing tricky or treacherous about him; you may mount without any fear, Senor Don Quixote; on my head be it if any harm befalls you.” Don Quixote thought that to say anything further with regard to his safety would be putting his courage in an unfavourable light; and so, without more words, he mounted Clavileno, and tried the peg, which turned easily; and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down, he looked like nothing so much as a figure in some Roman triumph painted or embroidered on a Flemish tapestry. Much against the grain, and very slowly, Sancho proceeded to mount, and, after settling himself as well as he could on the croup, found it rather hard, and not at all soft, and asked the duke if it would be possible to oblige him with a pad of some kind, or a cushion; even if it were off the couch of his lady the duchess, or the bed of one of the pages; as the haunches of that horse were more like marble than wood. On this the Trifaldi observed that Clavileno would not bear any kind of harness or trappings, and that his best plan would be to sit sideways like a woman, as in that way he would not feel the hardness so much. Sancho did so, and, bidding them farewell, allowed his eyes to he bandaged, but immediately afterwards uncovered them again, and looking tenderly and tearfully on those in the garden, bade them help him in his present strait with plenty of Paternosters and Ave Marias, that God might provide some one to say as many for them, whenever they found themselves in a similar emergency. At this Don Quixote exclaimed, “Art thou on the gallows, thief, or at thy last moment, to use pitiful entreaties of that sort? Cowardly, spiritless creature, art thou not in the very place the fair Magalona occupied, and from which she descended, not into the grave, but to become Queen of France; unless the histories lie? And I who am here beside thee, may I not put myself on a par with the valiant Pierres, who pressed this very spot that I now press? Cover thine eyes, cover thine eyes, abject animal, and let not thy fear escape thy lips, at least in my presence.” “Blindfold me,” said Sancho; “as you won’t let me commend myself or be commended to God, is it any wonder if I am afraid there is a region of devils about here that will carry us off to Peralvillo?” They were then blindfolded, and Don Quixote, finding himself settled to his satisfaction, felt for the peg, and the instant he placed his fingers on it, all the duennas and all who stood by lifted up their voices exclaiming, “God guide thee, valiant knight! God be with thee, intrepid squire! Now, now ye go cleaving the air more swiftly than an arrow! Now ye begin to amaze and astonish all who are gazing at you from the earth! Take care not to wobble about, valiant Sancho! Mind thou fall not, for thy fall will be worse than that rash youth’s who tried to steer the chariot of his father the Sun!” As Sancho heard the voices, clinging tightly to his master and winding his arms round him, he said, “Senor, how do they make out we are going up so high, if their voices reach us here and they seem to be speaking quite close to us?” “Don’t mind that, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “for as affairs of this sort, and flights like this are out of the common course of things, you can see and hear as much as you like a thousand leagues off; but don’t squeeze me so tight or thou wilt upset me; and really I know not what thou hast to be uneasy or frightened at, for I can safely swear I never mounted a smoother-going steed all the days of my life; one would fancy we never stirred from one place. Banish fear, my friend, for indeed everything is going as it ought, and we have the wind astern.” “That’s true,” said Sancho, “for such a strong wind comes against me on this side, that it seems as if people were blowing on me with a thousand pair of bellows;” which was the case; they were puffing at him with a great pair of bellows; for the whole adventure was so well planned by the duke, the duchess, and their majordomo, that nothing was omitted to make it perfectly successful. Don Quixote now, feeling the blast, said, “Beyond a doubt, Sancho, we must have already reached the second region of the air, where the hail and snow are generated; the thunder, the lightning, and the thunderbolts are engendered in the third region, and if we go on ascending at this rate, we shall shortly plunge into the region of fire, and I know not how to regulate this peg, so as not to mount up where we shall be burned.” And now they began to warm their faces, from a distance, with tow that could be easily set on fire and extinguished again, fixed on the end of a cane. On feeling the heat Sancho said, “May I die if we are not already in that fire place, or very near it, for a good part of my beard has been singed, and I have a mind, senor, to uncover and see whereabouts we are.” “Do nothing of the kind,” said Don Quixote; “remember the true story of the licentiate Torralva that the devils carried flying through the air riding on a stick with his eyes shut; who in twelve hours reached Rome and dismounted at Torre di Nona, which is a street of the city, and saw the whole sack and storming and the death of Bourbon, and was back in Madrid the next morning, where he gave an account of all he had seen; and he said moreover that as he was going through the air, the devil bade him open his eyes, and he did so, and saw himself so near the body of the moon, so it seemed to him, that he could have laid hold of it with his hand, and that he did not dare to look at the earth lest he should be seized with giddiness. So that, Sancho, it will not do for us to uncover ourselves, for he who has us in charge will be responsible for us; and perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to enable us to descend at one swoop on the kingdom of Kandy, as the saker or falcon does on the heron, so as to seize it however high it may soar; and though it seems to us not half an hour since we left the garden, believe me we must have travelled a great distance.” “I don’t know how that may be,” said Sancho; “all I know is that if the Senora Magallanes or Magalona was satisfied with this croup, she could not have been very tender of flesh.” The duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were listening to the conversation of the two heroes, and were beyond measure amused by it; and now, desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and well-contrived adventure, they applied a light to Clavileno’s tail with some tow, and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediately blew up with a prodigious noise, and brought Don Quixote and Sancho Panza to the ground half singed. By this time the bearded band of duennas, the Trifaldi and all, had vanished from the garden, and those that remained lay stretched on the ground as if in a swoon. Don Quixote and Sancho got up rather shaken, and, looking about them, were filled with amazement at finding themselves in the same garden from which they had started, and seeing such a number of people stretched on the ground; and their astonishment was increased when at one side of the garden they perceived a tall lance planted in the ground, and hanging from it by two cords of green silk a smooth white parchment on which there was the following inscription in large gold letters: “The illustrious knight Don Quixote of La Mancha has, by merely attempting it, finished and concluded the adventure of the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed Duenna; Malambruno is now satisfied on every point, the chins of the duennas are now smooth and clean, and King Don Clavijo and Queen Antonomasia in their original form; and when the squirely flagellation shall have been completed, the white dove shall find herself delivered from the pestiferous gerfalcons that persecute her, and in the arms of her beloved mate; for such is the decree of the sage Merlin, arch-enchanter of enchanters.” As soon as Don Quixote had read the inscription on the parchment he perceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of Dulcinea, and returning hearty thanks to heaven that he had with so little danger achieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexion the countenances of those venerable duennas, he advanced towards the duke and duchess, who had not yet come to themselves, and taking the duke by the hand he said, “Be of good cheer, worthy sir, be of good cheer; it’s nothing at all; the adventure is now over and without any harm done, as the inscription fixed on this post shows plainly.” The duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousness after a heavy sleep, and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrate about the garden did the same, with such demonstrations of wonder and amazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what they pretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality. The duke read the placard with half-shut eyes, and then ran to embrace Don Quixote with-open arms, declaring him to be the best knight that had ever been seen in any age. Sancho kept looking about for the Distressed One, to see what her face was like without the beard, and if she was as fair as her elegant person promised; but they told him that, the instant Clavileno descended flaming through the air and came to the ground, the whole band of duennas with the Trifaldi vanished, and that they were already shaved and without a stump left. The duchess asked Sancho how he had fared on that long journey, to which Sancho replied, “I felt, senora, that we were flying through the region of fire, as my master told me, and I wanted to uncover my eyes for a bit; but my master, when I asked leave to uncover myself, would not let me; but as I have a little bit of curiosity about me, and a desire to know what is forbidden and kept from me, quietly and without anyone seeing me I drew aside the handkerchief covering my eyes ever so little, close to my nose, and from underneath looked towards the earth, and it seemed to me that it was altogether no bigger than a grain of mustard seed, and that the men walking on it were little bigger than hazel nuts; so you may see how high we must have got to then.” To this the duchess said, “Sancho, my friend, mind what you are saying; it seems you could not have seen the earth, but only the men walking on it; for if the earth looked to you like a grain of mustard seed, and each man like a hazel nut, one man alone would have covered the whole earth.” “That is true,” said Sancho, “but for all that I got a glimpse of a bit of one side of it, and saw it all.” “Take care, Sancho,” said the duchess, “with a bit of one side one does not see the whole of what one looks at.” “I don’t understand that way of looking at things,” said Sancho; “I only know that your ladyship will do well to bear in mind that as we were flying by enchantment so I might have seen the whole earth and all the men by enchantment whatever way I looked; and if you won’t believe this, no more will you believe that, uncovering myself nearly to the eyebrows, I saw myself so close to the sky that there was not a palm and a half between me and it; and by everything that I can swear by, senora, it is mighty great! And it so happened we came by where the seven goats are, and by God and upon my soul, as in my youth I was a goatherd in my own country, as soon as I saw them I felt a longing to be among them for a little, and if I had not given way to it I think I’d have burst. So I come and take, and what do I do? without saying anything to anybody, not even to my master, softly and quietly I got down from Clavileno and amused myself with the goats — which are like violets, like flowers — for nigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavileno never stirred or moved from one spot.” “And while the good Sancho was amusing himself with the goats,” said the duke, “how did Senor Don Quixote amuse himself?” To which Don Quixote replied, “As all these things and such like occurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature, it is no wonder that Sancho says what he does; for my own part I can only say that I did not uncover my eyes either above or below, nor did I see sky or earth or sea or shore. It is true I felt that I was passing through the region of the air, and even that I touched that of fire; but that we passed farther I cannot believe; for the region of fire being between the heaven of the moon and the last region of the air, we could not have reached that heaven where the seven goats Sancho speaks of are without being burned; and as we were not burned, either Sancho is lying or Sancho is dreaming.” “I am neither lying nor dreaming,” said Sancho; “only ask me the tokens of those same goats, and you’ll see by that whether I’m telling the truth or not.” “Tell us them then, Sancho,” said the duchess. “Two of them,” said Sancho, “are green, two blood-red, two blue, and one a mixture of all colours.” “An odd sort of goat, that,” said the duke; “in this earthly region of ours we have no such colours; I mean goats of such colours.” “That’s very plain,” said Sancho; “of course there must be a difference between the goats of heaven and the goats of the earth.” “Tell me, Sancho,” said the duke, “did you see any he-goat among those goats?” “No, senor,” said Sancho; “but I have heard say that none ever passed the horns of the moon.” They did not care to ask him anything more about his journey, for they saw he was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an account of everything that went on there, without having ever stirred from the garden. Such, in short, was the end of the adventure of the Distressed Duenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not only for the time being, but for all their lives, and Sancho something to talk about for ages, if he lived so long; but Don Quixote, coming close to his ear, said to him, “Sancho, as you would have us believe what you saw in heaven, I require you to believe me as to what I saw in the cave of Montesinos; I say no more.” 此时天已傍晚，约定让著名的“轻木销”木马到来的时间也临近了。唐吉诃德开始不安起来。他怕马兰布鲁诺迟迟不把马送来，是觉得他不能胜任这次征险，再不然就是马兰布鲁诺不敢前来同他交战。这时，他忽然看见四个浑身披挂着常春藤的野人，肩扛着一匹木马走进了花园。他们把木马放到地上，一个野人说道： “哪位骑士有勇气，就骑上去吧。” “我不骑，”桑乔说，“我不是骑士，也没有勇气。” 野人又接着说： “如果这位骑士有侍从，就让他的侍从骑到马屁股上吧。请相信英勇的马兰布鲁诺，他只想比剑，决无其它恶意。只需拧一下马脖子上的这个销子①，马就可以带你们飞到马兰布鲁诺所在的地方。不过，飞得高会让人头晕，所以得把你们的眼睛蒙上，等到听到马嘶，就说明到了目的地，那时再把你们的眼睛解开。” ①上文说销子安在马额头上，这里变为安在马脖子上了。 说完，几个野人便撇下木马，神气活现地顺着原路出去了。忧伤妇人一看到木马，便几乎是眼含热泪地对唐吉诃德说道： “英勇的骑士，马兰布鲁诺已经说到做到了。现在木马果然来了，我们的胡须仍在增长。我们每个人，每根胡须，都请求您快点为我们动手吧。我们需要您做的只不过是同您的侍从一起骑上马去，开始你们的新旅程。” “我马上就照办，三摆裙伯爵夫人，而且心甘情愿，不会浪费时间去配坐垫，戴马刺。我急着要看夫人您和所有女仆的光滑面孔呢。” “我可不去，”桑乔说，“无论是软哄还是硬逼，我都不去。如果一定要我骑到木马的屁股上去，才能去掉她们的胡须，那就让我的主人另找一个侍从陪他，这几位夫人也另想办法去掉脸上的胡须吧。我不是巫师，不想到天上去飞。假如海岛上的臣民听说他们的总督在天上飞行，会怎样想呢？况且，从这儿到坎达亚有三千多西里，假如马累了或者巨人生气了，我们得耽搁五六年才能回来呢。到那时候，世上就没有什么岛屿要我去管了。常言道，‘越晚越玄’，还有，‘给你一头牛，赶紧拿绳牵’。让这些夫人的胡须原谅我吧。‘维持现状，再好不过’。我是说让我留在这儿最好，他们待我很好，我还指望在这儿弄个总督当呢。” 公爵说道： “桑乔朋友，我许诺给你的岛屿不会动，跑不了。它的根扎得很深，直扎到地底深处，就是费尽了力气也拔不出来挪不动。你我都知道，所有这类比较重要的官职总得多少付点代价才能得到。而我需要你为当这个总督付出的代价，就是同你的主人唐吉诃德一起去完成这件留芳千古的大事。你很快就可以骑着‘轻木销’赶回来。即使你时运不佳，像朝圣者似的一个客店一个客店走回来，你仍然会得到原来的那个岛屿，你的臣民们仍然会欢迎你去做他们的总督。我的主意不会改变。你对此别怀疑，桑乔朋友，否则就是辜负了我的一片厚意。” “别再说了，大人。”桑乔说，“我是个穷侍从，当不起您的如此厚望。让我的主人上马，再给我蒙上眼睛吧，愿上帝保佑我们。等飞到天上的时候，请告诉我一声，我要向上帝祈祷，还要祈求天使保佑呢。” 三摆裙夫人答道： “桑乔，你可以向上帝或者任何人祈祷。马兰布鲁诺虽然是个魔法师，可他也是个基督徒。他施魔法时准确而又谨慎，不会殃及其他人的。” “那么，”桑乔说，“就让上帝和加埃塔的三位一体来保佑我吧。” “自从那次难忘的砑布机冒险之后，”唐吉诃德说，“我从没见桑乔像现在这样害怕过。如果我也像其他人一样迷信，他这么怯懦就会使我从精神上气馁了。你过来，桑乔，如果诸位大人允许的话，我想单独同你说几句话。” 唐吉诃德同桑乔走到花园的树丛中，拉着桑乔的双手对他说道： “桑乔兄弟，你看到了，长途跋涉在等着咱们，连上帝都不知道咱们什么时候才回来，是否还有机会和时间。所以，我想让你假装去找一点路上需用的东西，现在就回到你的房间里去，赶紧把你承诺的那三千三百鞭子至少打五百下。该打的总得打呀。‘事情一着手，就算完成了一半’。” “我的上帝！”桑乔说，“您大概又犯糊涂了，就像人们常说的，‘又要马儿跑，又让马儿不吃草’！我现在得坐着硬木板远行，您这样做不是要打烂我的屁股吗？无论如何您都没道理。咱们现在先去为女仆们去掉胡须吧。我向您保证，等咱们回来，一定赶紧履行我的诺言，让您满意，别的我就不说了。” 唐吉诃德说道： “既然你这么承诺，我也就放心了。我相信你会履行诺言。 你虽然笨，可是人挺实在。” “我不算笨，也不算聪明，”桑乔说，“即使我条件一般，却能说到做到。” 说完两人就回来骑木马。唐吉诃德一骑上马就说道： “把眼睛蒙上，桑乔。上马吧，桑乔。人家从那么远的地方把马派来，不会骗咱们。欺骗相信自己的人是不光彩的。即使事情同我想象的相反，咱们的这次行动也只会带来荣誉，不会产生任何不良后果。” “咱们走吧，大人。”桑乔说，“这几位夫人的胡须和眼泪真是刺痛了我的心。在看到她们的脸光洁如初之前，我恐怕连一口东西也吃不下去。您先上马，把眼睛蒙上。我是坐在马屁股上的，当然应该是坐在鞍子上的先上马。” “是应该这样。”唐吉诃德说。 他从衣袋里掏出一条手绢，请忧伤妇人为他仔细地蒙上眼睛。眼睛蒙好后，他又把手绢解开，说道： “如果我没有记错的话，在维吉尔的著作里有个特洛伊的帕拉狄翁，那是希腊人献给帕拉斯女神的木马。在它的肚子里藏着武装骑士，这些骑士后来毁掉了特洛伊城。所以，最好是先看看‘轻木销’的肚子里有什么东西。” “这不必了，”忧伤妇人说，“我相信马兰布鲁诺，知道他不会做背信弃义的事。请您上马吧，唐吉诃德大人，用不着有丝毫害怕。如果出了什么事，由我负责。” 唐吉诃德觉得，提出任何有关安全的要求都会有损于他的勇气，也就不再争辩，骑上木马，试了试销子，转动得挺灵便。木马身上没有备马蹬，所以唐吉诃德垂着腿，样子就像弗拉门科壁毯上描画或织绣的罗马凯旋图中的某个人物。桑乔非常不情愿地慢慢爬上木马，尽可能地在马屁股上坐好。他发现这个马屁股有点硬，一点儿也不软，就问公爵是否能给他从公爵夫人的客厅或哪个侍童的床上找个坐垫或靠垫来。那马屁股简直不像是木头做的，倒像是大理石。三摆裙夫人说这匹木马不能再装任何东西，桑乔可以按照女式骑法横坐在马屁股上，那样就不会觉得那么硬了。桑乔照办了，并且说了声“再见”，让人蒙上了他的眼睛。眼睛蒙好后，他又重新解开，久久地凝视着花园里的所有人，眼含热泪地请求大家在这个关键时刻为他念《天主经》，念《万福玛利亚》。一旦他们遇到危险，上帝就也会派人为他们念经。 唐吉诃德说道： “你这个混蛋，难道你是要上断头台，或是快要咽气了，竟如此祈求祷告？你这个没有良心的胆小鬼！你现在坐的位子不正是美丽的马加洛娜原来坐过的地方吗？历史总不会骗人，后来她从马上下来后并没有进坟墓，而是当了法兰西的王后。我就在你旁边，我现在坐的地方就是彼雷斯原来坐过的地方，能道我比不上他吗？你这个没心没肺的畜生，蒙上眼睛，蒙上眼睛吧！别让你的恐惧从嘴上表现出来，至少别在我面前出声！” “请把我的眼睛蒙上吧。”桑乔说，“既然不愿意让我祈求上帝，又不愿意让别人为我祷告，我害怕又有什么可说的呢？ 说不定会有一群魔鬼把咱们弄到佩拉尔比略①去呢。” ①佩拉尔比略是在雷阿尔城附近民团处决罪犯的地方。 两人蒙上了眼睛，唐吉诃德觉得一切已准备就绪，就伸手去摸销子。他的手刚刚触到销子，在场的女仆和其他所有人都高喊起来： “上帝为你引路，英勇的骑士！” “上帝与你在一起，无畏的侍从！” “你们已经飞起来了，以超过飞箭的速度刺破天空吧！” “地上所有注视着你们的人已经开始惊讶和羡慕了！” “坐稳了，英勇的桑乔，别晃悠！小心别摔下来！从前那个鲁莽的小伙子驾驭太阳车就摔了下来。好家伙，你若是摔下来，就会比他摔得还惨！” 桑乔听到喊声，紧紧地搂着唐吉诃德，对他说道： “大人，他们说咱们飞得已经很高了，可是为什么咱们还能听见他们的声音，而且声音就像在咱们身边似的？” “你就别管了，桑乔，这种事情以及咱们的飞行都是超常规的，你能够任意看到和听到千里之外的事情。别搂我这么紧，你快要把我拽倒了。我真不明白你究竟怕什么。我发誓，这是我平生骑得最平稳的一次，简直就像在原地不动似的。别害怕，伙计，一切正常，而且非常顺利。” “是啊，”桑乔说，“我这边风特别大，好像有上千只风箱在对着我吹似的。” 确实有几只大风箱在吹他们。公爵、公爵夫人和管家对这个闹剧进行了精心策划，没有露出一点儿破绽。 唐吉诃德觉得有风，就说： “桑乔，咱们大概是到了第二层天，这儿有冰雹雪花，而雷鸣电闪是在第三层天。如果照这样往上升，咱们很快就会到达火焰天了。我不知道该怎么拧这个销子，才能够不继续上升，否则咱们就得被烤焦了。” 此时正有人用竹竿挑着一些点燃的薄麻布片，从远处烤他们的脸。桑乔觉到了热，说道： “我敢打赌，咱们现在已经到了火焰天，或者离它很近了，因为我的一大片胡子已经被烤焦了。大人，我想打开布看看咱们到底在什么地方。” “不行，”唐吉诃德说，“你可别忘了托拉尔瓦②的真实故事。魔鬼驱使他骑着竹竿，闭着眼睛，十二个小时就到了罗马。他在罗马城一条名叫托雷·德诺奈的街上落地，看到了波旁①失败、被袭和死亡的全过程。羿日早晨他又回到了马德里，报告了他在罗马看到的事情。他还说，他在空中飞行的时候，魔鬼叫他睁开眼睛。他把眼睛睁开了，觉得自己离月亮已经很近，简直伸手可得。他不敢往地面上看，怕自己会昏厥过去。所以桑乔，咱们没必要把蒙眼布解开。如果有什么情况，带咱们飞的人会告诉咱们。也许咱们现在正盘旋上升，准备直奔坎达亚王国，就像猎鹰在草鹭上方盘旋那样。它飞得再高，也是要扑下来捕捉草鹭的。虽然咱们离开花园才不过半小时，我却觉得咱们已经走了很远的路。” ①欧亨尼奥·托拉尔瓦，西班牙16世纪一教士，在宗教法庭上说他被魔鬼驱使，骑着一根竹竿，一夜之间往返罗马，目睹了1527年罗马大劫乱的场面。 ②法国陆军元帅，1527年进攻罗马时战死。 “我不知道，”桑乔说，“我只知道马加良娜或马加洛娜夫人若是喜欢这种马屁股，她的皮肉也不会很娇嫩。” 两位勇士的对话都被公爵、公爵夫人和花园里的其他人听到了，大家觉得很开心。他们觉得这场精心策划的闹剧该收场了，就用点燃的麻布去烧木马的尾巴，马肚子里装满了花炮，立刻一声巨响爆炸了，把唐吉诃德和桑乔掀到了地上。 两人都被烧得半焦。 此时，花园里那群满面胡须的女仆和三摆裙夫人都不见了，花园里的其他人则像昏了过去似的躺到地上。唐吉诃德和桑乔遍体鳞伤地从地上爬起来，惊恐地看到他们还在刚才的那个花园里，而且地上躺了许多人。更让他们惊奇的是看到花园一侧的地上有一支巨大的长矛插在地上，长矛上用两条绿色绸带系着一张白羊皮纸，上面用金色大字写着： 曼查的著名骑士唐吉诃德初试得手，结束了三摆裙夫人又名忧伤妇人及其同伴的苦难。 马兰布鲁诺心满意足，女仆的胡须已一根不剩，克拉维霍国王和安东诺玛霞王后已恢复原样。魔法师之王梅尔林有令，待骑士的侍从打够了鞭数，白鸽就能摆脱恶鹰的追逐，投入情侣的怀抱。 唐吉诃德看完羊皮纸上的字，知道这是指为杜尔西内亚解除魔法的事。他一再感谢老天让他仅冒如此小的风险就完成了如此伟大的事业，让那些令人尊敬的女仆又恢复了原来的样子。不过，现在那些女仆已经不见踪影了。唐吉诃德来到尚未苏醒过来的公爵和公爵夫人身旁，拉着公爵的手说道： “喂，善良的大人，醒醒，醒醒吧，一切都过去了，而且十全十美，在那张羊皮纸上写得很清楚。” 公爵慢慢睁开眼睛，仿佛刚从梦中醒来。公爵夫人和花园里的其他人也都苏醒过来。大家都装出十分惊奇和意外的样子，仿佛他们刻意安排的那些事确实发生过一样。公爵眼睛半睁半闭地看了看那张羊皮纸，然后张开双臂拥抱唐吉诃德，说唐吉诃德是古往今来最优秀的骑士。桑乔四处寻找忧伤妇人，想看看她没有胡须的脸是什么样子，是否真像她俊俏的身材那样漂亮。可是别人告诉他，木马燃烧着从空中落到地上时，包括三摆裙夫人在内的所有女仆脸上都已一干二净，而且转眼就不知去向了。公爵夫人问桑乔这次长途旅行的情况，桑乔回答说： “夫人，我觉得我们飞到了我的主人说的火焰天。我想把蒙眼睛的布掀开一点儿往外看看，可是我的主人不允许。不过，我也不知道是出于什么好奇心，越是不让我知道的事情我就越想知道。我不露声色地把蒙眼睛的布往鼻子那儿挪了挪，偷偷往地球看了一眼，看到地球只不过是芥菜子那么大，上面走动的人倒比榛子还大点儿，一个人就可以把整个地球盖住，由此可见我们飞得有多高了。” 公爵夫人说道： “桑乔朋友，你看你说些什么呀。看来你并没有看见地球，只是看到了地球上行走的人。你看见地球只有芥菜子那么点儿，而人倒有榛子那么大，当然一个人就可以把地球遮住了。” “事实就是这样。”桑乔说，“不管怎么说，我是从一道缝里往下看的，看到了整个地球。” “桑乔，”公爵夫人说，“从一条缝里是看不到事物全部的。” “我不知道是否看得到全部，”桑乔说，“我只知道您该明白，我们是靠魔力飞行的。靠着魔力，我从任何方向都可以看到整个地球和地球上的人。如果您不相信这点，也就不会相信我是把蒙眼睛的布挪到了眉毛上，看见自己已经挨近天了，离天只不过一拃半远。我敢发誓，那个天特别大。后来我们又经过了七只小羊的地方①。上帝可以作证，我小时候在家乡当过羊倌，所以一看见它们，就想过去逗它们玩一会儿。若是不能和它们玩一会儿，我会难受死的。怎么办呢？我不声不响，对任何人都没说，也没和主人说，就悄悄地下了木马，同小羊玩起来。那小羊漂亮得像花朵似的。我同它们玩了三刻钟，那木马在原地一动不动，一步都没有向前走。” “那么，在好桑乔同小羊玩的时候，”公爵问，“唐吉诃德大人干什么呢？” ①这里指昂星座。 唐吉诃德答道： “这种事情已经超出了常规，所以随便桑乔怎么说，都算不了什么。至于我，我没有把蒙眼布往上掀或者往下拉，没看见天，也没看见地，没看见海，也没看见沙滩。我只是确实感觉到我在天空中飞，几乎快到火焰天了。我不相信能穿过位于月亮层和天顶之间的火焰天，如果我们到了桑乔所说的有七只小羊的那层天，我们早就被烧死了。既然我们没有被烧死，那就说明桑乔在说谎或是做梦。” “我没说谎，也没做梦。”桑乔说，“不信你们问我那几只羊的情况，就能知道我说的是不是真话了。” “你说吧，桑乔。”公爵夫人说。 “有两只是绿色的，”桑乔说，“有两只是红色的，有两只是蓝色的，还有一只是杂色的。” “这些羊可真新鲜。”公爵说，“我是说在我们这个地方，羊一般不是这种颜色。” “这很清楚，”桑乔说，“天上的羊和地上羊就是不一样嘛。” “那你说，桑乔，”公爵问道，“那几只羊里有公羊吗？” “没有，大人，”桑乔说，“我听说它们都没什么区别。” 大家不再问他旅途上的事，觉得桑乔虽然并没出花园，却准备把他在天上见到的所有事情都一一细数呢。 忧伤妇人的故事到此结束。它不仅当时为公爵提供了笑料，而且成了他一辈子的笑料。如果他能活几百年，他会把桑乔的事讲上几百年。唐吉诃德凑到桑乔身边，对桑乔耳语道： “桑乔，你若想让人们相信你在天上的那些见闻，就应该先相信我在蒙特西诺斯洞的见闻，别的我就不多说了！”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4662.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don
