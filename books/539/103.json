{"id":42243,"no":103,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 49","content":"We left the great governor angered and irritated by that portrait-painting rogue of a farmer who, instructed the majordomo, as the majordomo was by the duke, tried to practise upon him; he however, fool, boor, and clown as he was, held his own against them all, saying to those round him and to Doctor Pedro Recio, who as soon as the private business of the duke’s letter was disposed of had returned to the room, “Now I see plainly enough that judges and governors ought to be and must be made of brass not to feel the importunities of the applicants that at all times and all seasons insist on being heard, and having their business despatched, and their own affairs and no others attended to, come what may; and if the poor judge does not hear them and settle the matter — either because he cannot or because that is not the time set apart for hearing them — forthwith they abuse him, and run him down, and gnaw at his bones, and even pick holes in his pedigree. You silly, stupid applicant, don’t be in a hurry; wait for the proper time and season for doing business; don’t come at dinner-hour, or at bed-time; for judges are only flesh and blood, and must give to Nature what she naturally demands of them; all except myself, for in my case I give her nothing to eat, thanks to Senor Doctor Pedro Recio Tirteafuera here, who would have me die of hunger, and declares that death to be life; and the same sort of life may God give him and all his kind — I mean the bad doctors; for the good ones deserve palms and laurels.”\n All who knew Sancho Panza were astonished to hear him speak so elegantly, and did not know what to attribute it to unless it were that office and grave responsibility either smarten or stupefy men’s wits. At last Doctor Pedro Recio Agilers of Tirteafuera promised to let him have supper that night though it might be in contravention of all the aphorisms of Hippocrates. With this the governor was satisfied and looked forward to the approach of night and supper-time with great anxiety; and though time, to his mind, stood still and made no progress, nevertheless the hour he so longed for came, and they gave him a beef salad with onions and some boiled calves’ feet rather far gone. At this he fell to with greater relish than if they had given him francolins from Milan, pheasants from Rome, veal from Sorrento, partridges from Moron, or geese from Lavajos, and turning to the doctor at supper he said to him, “Look here, senor doctor, for the future don’t trouble yourself about giving me dainty things or choice dishes to eat, for it will be only taking my stomach off its hinges; it is accustomed to goat, cow, bacon, hung beef, turnips and onions; and if by any chance it is given these palace dishes, it receives them squeamishly, and sometimes with loathing. What the head-carver had best do is to serve me with what they call ollas podridas (and the rottener they are the better they smell); and he can put whatever he likes into them, so long as it is good to eat, and I’ll be obliged to him, and will requite him some day. But let nobody play pranks on me, for either we are or we are not; let us live and eat in peace and good-fellowship, for when God sends the dawn, be sends it for all. I mean to govern this island without giving up a right or taking a bribe; let everyone keep his eye open, and look out for the arrow; for I can tell them ‘the devil’s in Cantillana,’ and if they drive me to it they’ll see something that will astonish them. Nay! make yourself honey and the flies eat you.”\n “Of a truth, senor governor,” said the carver, “your worship is in the right of it in everything you have said; and I promise you in the name of all the inhabitants of this island that they will serve your worship with all zeal, affection, and good-will, for the mild kind of government you have given a sample of to begin with, leaves them no ground for doing or thinking anything to your worship’s disadvantage.”\n “That I believe,” said Sancho; “and they would be great fools if they did or thought otherwise; once more I say, see to my feeding and my Dapple’s for that is the great point and what is most to the purpose; and when the hour comes let us go the rounds, for it is my intention to purge this island of all manner of uncleanness and of all idle good-for-nothing vagabonds; for I would have you know that lazy idlers are the same thing in a State as the drones in a hive, that eat up the honey the industrious bees make. I mean to protect the husbandman, to preserve to the gentleman his privileges, to reward the virtuous, and above all to respect religion and honour its ministers. What say you to that, my friends? Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to no purpose?”\n “There is so much in what your worship says, senor governor,” said the majordomo, “that I am filled with wonder when I see a man like your worship, entirely without learning (for I believe you have none at all), say such things, and so full of sound maxims and sage remarks, very different from what was expected of your worship’s intelligence by those who sent us or by us who came here. Every day we see something new in this world; jokes become realities, and the jokers find the tables turned upon them.”\n Night came, and with the permission of Doctor Pedro Recio, the governor had supper. They then got ready to go the rounds, and he started with the majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, the chronicler charged with recording his deeds, and alguacils and notaries enough to form a fair-sized squadron. In the midst marched Sancho with his staff, as fine a sight as one could wish to see, and but a few streets of the town had been traversed when they heard a noise as of a clashing of swords. They hastened to the spot, and found that the combatants were but two, who seeing the authorities approaching stood still, and one of them exclaimed, “Help, in the name of God and the king! Are men to he allowed to rob in the middle of this town, and rush out and attack people in the very streets?”\n “Be calm, my good man,” said Sancho, “and tell me what the cause of this quarrel is; for I am the governor.”\n Said the other combatant, “Senor governor, I will tell you in a very few words. Your worship must know that this gentleman has just now won more than a thousand reals in that gambling house opposite, and God knows how. I was there, and gave more than one doubtful point in his favour, very much against what my conscience told me. He made off with his winnings, and when I made sure he was going to give me a crown or so at least by way of a present, as it is usual and customary to give men of quality of my sort who stand by to see fair or foul play, and back up swindles, and prevent quarrels, he pocketed his money and left the house. Indignant at this I followed him, and speaking him fairly and civilly asked him to give me if it were only eight reals, for he knows I am an honest man and that I have neither profession nor property, for my parents never brought me up to any or left me any; but the rogue, who is a greater thief than Cacus and a greater sharper than Andradilla, would not give me more than four reals; so your worship may see how little shame and conscience he has. But by my faith if you had not come up I’d have made him disgorge his winnings, and he’d have learned what the range of the steel-yard was.”\n “What say you to this?” asked Sancho. The other replied that all his antagonist said was true, and that he did not choose to give him more than four reals because he very often gave him money; and that those who expected presents ought to be civil and take what is given them with a cheerful countenance, and not make any claim against winners unless they know them for certain to be sharpers and their winnings to be unfairly won; and that there could be no better proof that he himself was an honest man than his having refused to give anything; for sharpers always pay tribute to lookers-on who know them.\n “That is true,” said the majordomo; “let your worship consider what is to be done with these men.”\n “What is to be done,” said Sancho, “is this; you, the winner, be you good, bad, or indifferent, give this assailant of yours a hundred reals at once, and you must disburse thirty more for the poor prisoners; and you who have neither profession nor property, and hang about the island in idleness, take these hundred reals now, and some time of the day to-morrow quit the island under sentence of banishment for ten years, and under pain of completing it in another life if you violate the sentence, for I’ll hang you on a gibbet, or at least the hangman will by my orders; not a word from either of you, or I’ll make him feel my hand.”\n The one paid down the money and the other took it, and the latter quitted the island, while the other went home; and then the governor said, “Either I am not good for much, or I’ll get rid of these gambling houses, for it strikes me they are very mischievous.”\n “This one at least,” said one of the notaries, “your worship will not be able to get rid of, for a great man owns it, and what he loses every year is beyond all comparison more than what he makes by the cards. On the minor gambling houses your worship may exercise your power, and it is they that do most harm and shelter the most barefaced practices; for in the houses of lords and gentlemen of quality the notorious sharpers dare not attempt to play their tricks; and as the vice of gambling has become common, it is better that men should play in houses of repute than in some tradesman’s , where they catch an unlucky fellow in the small hours of the morning and skin him alive.”\n “I know already, notary, that there is a good deal to he said on that point,” said Sancho.\n And now a tipstaff came up with a young man in his grasp, and said, “Senor governor, this youth was coming towards us, and as soon as he saw the officers of justice he turned about and ran like a deer, a sure proof that he must be some evil-doer; I ran after him, and had it not been that he stumbled and fell, I should never have caught him.”\n “What did you run for, fellow?” said Sancho.\n To which the young man replied, “Senor, it was to avoid answering all the questions officers of justice put.”\n “What are you by trade?”\n “A weaver.”\n “And what do you weave?”\n “Lance heads, with your worship’s good leave.”\n “You’re facetious with me! You plume yourself on being a wag? Very good; and where were you going just now?”\n “To take the air, senor.”\n “And where does one take the air in this island?”\n “Where it blows.”\n “Good! your answers are very much to the point; you are a smart youth; but take notice that I am the air, and that I blow upon you a-stern, and send you to gaol. Ho there! lay hold of him and take him off; I’ll make him sleep there to-night without air.”\n “By God,” said the young man, “your worship will make me sleep in gaol just as soon as make me king.”\n “Why shan’t I make thee sleep in gaol?” said Sancho. “Have I not the power to arrest thee and release thee whenever I like?”\n “All the power your worship has,” said the young man, “won’t be able to make me sleep in gaol.”\n “How? not able!” said Sancho; “take him away at once where he’ll see his mistake with his own eyes, even if the gaoler is willing to exert his interested generosity on his behalf; for I’ll lay a penalty of two thousand ducats on him if he allows him to stir a step from the prison.”\n “That’s ridiculous,” said the young man; “the fact is, all the men on earth will not make me sleep in prison.”\n “Tell me, you devil,” said Sancho, “have you got any angel that will deliver you, and take off the irons I am going to order them to put upon you?”\n “Now, senor governor,” said the young man in a sprightly manner, “let us be reasonable and come to the point. Granted your worship may order me to be taken to prison, and to have irons and chains put on me, and to be shut up in a cell, and may lay heavy penalties on the gaoler if he lets me out, and that he obeys your orders; still, if I don’t choose to sleep, and choose to remain awake all night without closing an eye, will your worship with all your power be able to make me sleep if I don’t choose?”\n “No, truly,” said the secretary, “and the fellow has made his point.”\n “So then,” said Sancho, “it would be entirely of your own choice you would keep from sleeping; not in opposition to my will?”\n “No, senor,” said the youth, “certainly not.”\n “Well then, go, and God be with you,” said Sancho; “be off home to sleep, and God give you sound sleep, for I don’t want to rob you of it; but for the future, let me advise you don’t joke with the authorities, because you may come across some one who will bring down the joke on your own skull.”\n The young man went his way, and the governor continued his round, and shortly afterwards two tipstaffs came up with a man in custody, and said, “Senor governor, this person, who seems to be a man, is not so, but a woman, and not an ill-favoured one, in man’s clothes.” They raised two or three lanterns to her face, and by their light they distinguished the features of a woman to all appearance of the age of sixteen or a little more, with her hair gathered into a gold and green silk net, and fair as a thousand pearls. They scanned her from head to foot, and observed that she had on red silk stockings with garters of white taffety bordered with gold and pearl; her breeches were of green and gold stuff, and under an open jacket or jerkin of the same she wore a doublet of the finest white and gold cloth; her shoes were white and such as men wear; she carried no sword at her belt, but only a richly ornamented dagger, and on her fingers she had several handsome rings. In short, the girl seemed fair to look at in the eyes of all, and none of those who beheld her knew her, the people of the town said they could not imagine who she was, and those who were in the secret of the jokes that were to be practised upon Sancho were the ones who were most surprised, for this incident or discovery had not been arranged by them; and they watched anxiously to see how the affair would end.\n Sancho was fascinated by the girl’s beauty, and he asked her who she was, where she was going, and what had induced her to dress herself in that garb. She with her eyes fixed on the ground answered in modest confusion, “I cannot tell you, senor, before so many people what it is of such consequence to me to have kept secret; one thing I wish to be known, that I am no thief or evildoer, but only an unhappy maiden whom the power of jealousy has led to break through the respect that is due to modesty.”\n Hearing this the majordomo said to Sancho, “Make the people stand back, senor governor, that this lady may say what she wishes with less embarrassment.”\n Sancho gave the order, and all except the majordomo, the head-carver, and the secretary fell back. Finding herself then in the presence of no more, the damsel went on to say, “I am the daughter, sirs, of Pedro Perez Mazorca, the wool-farmer of this town, who is in the habit of coming very often to my father’s house.”\n “That won’t do, senora,” said the majordomo; “for I know Pedro Perez very well, and I know he has no child at all, either son or daughter; and besides, though you say he is your father, you add then that he comes very often to your father’s house.”\n “I had already noticed that,” said Sancho.\n “I am confused just now, sirs,” said the damsel, “and I don’t know what I am saying; but the truth is that I am the daughter of Diego de la Llana, whom you must all know.”\n “Ay, that will do,” said the majordomo; “for I know Diego de la Llana, and know that he is a gentleman of position and a rich man, and that he has a son and a daughter, and that since he was left a widower nobody in all this town can speak of having seen his daughter’s face; for he keeps her so closely shut up that he does not give even the sun a chance of seeing her; and for all that report says she is extremely beautiful.”\n “It is true,” said the damsel, “and I am that daughter; whether report lies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decided by this time, as you have seen me;” and with this she began to weep bitterly.\n On seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver’s ear, and said to him in a low voice, “Something serious has no doubt happened this poor maiden, that she goes wandering from home in such a dress and at such an hour, and one of her rank too.” “There can be no doubt about it,” returned the carver, “and moreover her tears confirm your suspicion.” Sancho gave her the best comfort he could, and entreated her to tell them without any fear what had happened her, as they would all earnestly and by every means in their power endeavour to relieve her.\n “The fact is, sirs,” said she, “that my father has kept me shut up these ten years, for so long is it since the earth received my mother. Mass is said at home in a sumptuous chapel, and all this time I have seen but the sun in the heaven by day, and the moon and the stars by night; nor do I know what streets are like, or plazas, or churches, or even men, except my father and a brother I have, and Pedro Perez the wool-farmer; whom, because he came frequently to our house, I took it into my head to call my father, to avoid naming my own. This seclusion and the restrictions laid upon my going out, were it only to church, have been keeping me unhappy for many a day and month past; I longed to see the world, or at least the town where I was born, and it did not seem to me that this wish was inconsistent with the respect maidens of good quality should have for themselves. When I heard them talking of bull-fights taking place, and of javelin games, and of acting plays, I asked my brother, who is a year younger than myself, to tell me what sort of things these were, and many more that I had never seen; he explained them to me as well as he could, but the only effect was to kindle in me a still stronger desire to see them. At last, to cut short the story of my ruin, I begged and entreated my brother — O that I had never made such an entreaty — ” And once more she gave way to a burst of weeping.\n “Proceed, senora,” said the majordomo, “and finish your story of what has happened to you, for your words and tears are keeping us all in suspense.”\n “I have but little more to say, though many a tear to shed,” said the damsel; “for ill-placed desires can only be paid for in some such way.”\n The maiden’s beauty had made a deep impression on the head-carver’s heart, and he again raised his lantern for another look at her, and thought they were not tears she was shedding, but seed-pearl or dew of the meadow, nay, he exalted them still higher, and made Oriental pearls of them, and fervently hoped her misfortune might not be so great a one as her tears and sobs seemed to indicate. The governor was losing patience at the length of time the girl was taking to tell her story, and told her not to keep them waiting any longer; for it was late, and there still remained a good deal of the town to be gone over.\n She, with broken sobs and half-suppressed sighs, went on to say, “My misfortune, my misadventure, is simply this, that I entreated my brother to dress me up as a man in a suit of his clothes, and take me some night, when our father was asleep, to see the whole town; he, overcome by my entreaties, consented, and dressing me in this suit and himself in clothes of mine that fitted him as if made for him (for he has not a hair on his chin, and might pass for a very beautiful young girl), to-night, about an hour ago, more or less, we left the house, and guided by our youthful and foolish impulse we made the circuit of the whole town, and then, as we were about to return home, we saw a great troop of people coming, and my brother said to me, ‘Sister, this must be the round, stir your feet and put wings to them, and follow me as fast as you can, lest they recognise us, for that would be a bad business for us;’ and so saying he turned about and began, I cannot say to run but to fly; in less than six paces I fell from fright, and then the officer of justice came up and carried me before your worships, where I find myself put to shame before all these people as whimsical and vicious.”\n “So then, senora,” said Sancho, “no other mishap has befallen you, nor was it jealousy that made you leave home, as you said at the beginning of your story?”\n “Nothing has happened me,” said she, “nor was it jealousy that brought me out, but merely a longing to see the world, which did not go beyond seeing the streets of this town.”\n The appearance of the tipstaffs with her brother in custody, whom one of them had overtaken as he ran away from his sister, now fully confirmed the truth of what the damsel said. He had nothing on but a rich petticoat and a short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace, and his head was uncovered and adorned only with its own hair, which looked like rings of gold, so bright and curly was it. The governor, the majordomo, and the carver went aside with him, and, unheard by his sister, asked him how he came to be in that dress, and he with no less shame and embarrassment told exactly the same story as his sister, to the great delight of the enamoured carver; the governor, however, said to them, “In truth, young lady and gentleman, this has been a very childish affair, and to explain your folly and rashness there was no necessity for all this delay and all these tears and sighs; for if you had said we are so-and-so, and we escaped from our father’s house in this way in order to ramble about, out of mere curiosity and with no other object, there would have been an end of the matter, and none of these little sobs and tears and all the rest of it.”\n “That is true,” said the damsel, “but you see the confusion I was in was so great it did not let me behave as I ought.”\n “No harm has been done,” said Sancho; “come, we will leave you at your father’s house; perhaps they will not have missed you; and another time don’t be so childish or eager to see the world; for a respectable damsel should have a broken leg and keep at home; and the woman and the hen by gadding about are soon lost; and she who is eager to see is also eager to be seen; I say no more.”\n The youth thanked the governor for his kind offer to take them home, and they directed their steps towards the house, which was not far off. On reaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating, and immediately a woman-servant who was waiting for them came down and opened the door to them, and they went in, leaving the party marvelling as much at their grace and beauty as at the fancy they had for seeing the world by night and without quitting the village; which, however, they set down to their youth.\n The head-carver was left with a heart pierced through and through, and he made up his mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriage of her father on the morrow, making sure she would not be refused him as he was a servant of the duke’s ; and even to Sancho ideas and schemes of marrying the youth to his daughter Sanchica suggested themselves, and he resolved to open the negotiation at the proper season, persuading himself that no husband could be refused to a governor’s daughter. And so the night’s round came to an end, and a couple of days later the government, whereby all his plans were overthrown and swept away, as will be seen farther on.\n \n 前面说到桑乔正在为农夫的那番描述而生闷气。其实，那个农夫是受管家的委派，管家又受公爵的指使，前来捉弄桑乔的。桑乔虽然又粗又笨，却并没有被耍弄。桑乔看完公爵给他的密信，又回到客厅，对身边的人和佩德罗·雷西奥大夫说：\n “现在我算真正明白了，无论是地方官还是总督，都得是铁人才成，以便无论什么时候有人来找他，他都不能烦，都得听他们说，为他们办事，不管有什么情况，都得先办他们的事。如果长官不听他们说，不办他们的事，或者办不到，或者当时不见他们，他们就骂骂咧咧，嘀嘀咕咕，甚至连老祖宗也捎带上。这些前来办事的笨蛋，你着什么急呀，你等合适的时候再来，别在吃饭和睡觉的时候来嘛。长官也是肉长的，该怎么样时就得怎么样。可我就不能这样，想吃也不能吃。这全怪旁边这位佩德罗·雷西奥·蒂尔特亚富埃拉。他想饿死我，却说这样才能长寿。但愿上帝让他和所有像他这样的医生都如此长寿。当然，我说的是坏医生，对于好医生应该嘉奖。”\n 那些认识桑乔的人听到他如此慷慨陈词都感到吃惊，不知他为什么会这样，认为大概是重要的职位能使人更聪明，或者更愚蠢吧。最后佩德罗·雷西奥大夫答应，无论希波克拉底还有什么告诫，也要让桑乔当天吃晚饭。总督听了十分高兴，焦急地等着晚饭时间到来。虽然桑乔觉得时间似乎静止不动了，晚饭的时间总算如期而至。晚饭是凉拌牛肉葱头和已经放了几天的炖牛蹄，桑乔吃得津津有味，比吃米兰的鹧鸪、罗马的雉鸡、索伦托的小牛肉、莫隆的石鸡或拉瓦霍斯的鹅还香。他边吃还边对医生说：\n “我说大夫，以后你不必给我弄什么大鱼大肉或者美味佳肴，那样反倒让我倒胃口。我的胃就习惯羊肉、牛肉、腌猪肉、咸肉干、萝卜、葱头什么的。如果吃宫廷大菜，我倒吃不惯，有时候还恶心呢。餐厅侍者可以把那个叫什锦火锅的菜给我端来，里面的东西越杂，味道越好，只要是吃的，往里面放什么都可以。我早晚会酬谢他的。谁也别想拿我开心，否则我就豁出去了。大家在一起客客气气，彼此都愉快。我在这个岛上该管的就管，不该管的就不管；大家各扫门前雪就行了。我告诉你，否则就会乱成一团。到时候你们就知道我的厉害了，别敬酒不吃吃罚酒。”\n “真的，总督大人，”餐厅侍者说，“您刚才说得太对了。我代表岛上的居民向您表示，愿意不折不扣而且满腔热忱地为您效劳。您一开始就对我们这么好，我们怎么会不尽心竭力地为您效劳呢！”\n “我相信这点，”桑乔说，“谁要想干别的，那可就是自找倒霉了。我再说一遍，你们注意给我和我的驴弄好吃的，这才是最要紧的事。等会儿咱们去巡视一下，我想把这个岛上的种种坏事以及游手好闲、不务正业的人都清除干净。我可以告诉你们，各位朋友，游手好闲的人在这个国家里就好像是蜂房里的雄蜂，它们专吃工蜂做的蜂蜜。我要照顾劳动者，维护贵族的地位，奖励品行端正的人，尊重宗教和宗教人士的名誉。你们觉得怎么样，朋友们，我是不是有点烦人呢？”\n “您讲了这些，”管家说，“使我感到很佩服。像您这样没有文化的人，我估计甚至是大字不识一个的人，竟能如此金口玉言，已经超出了派我们到这儿来的人以及我们这些人的意料。看来世界上真是无奇不有，玩笑竟变成了现实，想嘲弄别人的人自己倒被嘲弄了。”\n 到了晚上，经过雷西奥的批准，桑乔吃过晚饭，大家收拾妥当，便准备外出巡视。陪同的有管家、文书、餐厅侍者、专门记录桑乔行踪的传记作者、差役和文书，浩浩荡荡，行色壮观。桑乔拿着他的权杖神气活现地走在中间。他们才巡视了几条街，就听见一阵乒乒乓乓的声音，原来是两个人在打架。他们一见来了当官的，就住了手。其中一人说道：\n “上帝保佑！国王保佑！在大街上竟会遭抢，在光天化日之下竟有人行抢！”\n “别着急，好人，”桑乔说，“告诉我为什么打架，我是总督。”\n 有一个人说道：\n “总督大人，我来简单讲一下。您大概明白，这个道貌岸然的人刚才在对面那家赌场里赢了一千多雷阿尔，天知道他是怎么赢的。我当时就在旁边，知道他做了几次手脚，可是我昧着良心没说。他赢了钱，我等着他给我至少一个埃斯库多做抽头儿，这是我们这类人的规矩。我们专门给人帮忙，谁手脚不干净也不说，以免打架。可是他却把钱一揣，出了赌场。我气急败坏地跟了出来，对他好言相劝，让他怎么也得给我八个雷阿尔。他知道我这个人没职业也没收入，因为我父母既没教我也没给我什么职业。可这个狡猾的家伙比卡科还贼，比安德拉迪利亚还鬼，他只想给我四个雷阿尔。您看，总督大人，他多不要脸，多没良心！不过就是您没来，我也会让他把钱吐出来，让他明白明白。”\n “你有什么好说的？”桑乔问另一个人。\n 那个人说这个人说的全是实话，他只能给这个人四个雷阿尔，因为他已经给过这个人好几次钱了。另外，要抽头儿的人得讲点礼貌，如果他不能肯定赢钱的人手脚不老实，那钱不是正经赢来的，他拿钱时应陪着笑脸，不能计较给多少。为了证明自己是好人，而不是像那人说的那样手脚不老实，他一个钱也不准备多给。只有手脚不老实的人才会给旁边看破他作弊的人一些赏钱呢。\n “是这样，”管家说，“总督，您看该怎样处理这两个人呢？”\n “现在应该做的是，”桑乔说，“你，赢家，不管你是不是好人，或者你又是又不是，马上给跟你打架的这个人一百个雷阿尔，然后你还得掏三十个雷阿尔给监狱里那些可怜的人们。而你这个既没职业又没收入、在岛上无所事事的人呢，拿上这一百个雷阿尔，明天就离开这个岛吧，十年内不许回来，如果违反，就罚你来世补罪。我要把你吊在耻辱柱上，至少我派去的刽子手会这样做。谁也别再说什么，否则我就要揍你们了。”\n 一个人掏了钱，另一个人收了钱；这个人离开了岛屿，那个人回了家。总督说道：\n “除非我能力不足，否则我一定要取缔这些赌场，我觉得它们是非常有害的地方。”\n “至少这一家您不能取缔。”文书说，“这家赌场是一个大人物开的，他打牌每年输掉的钱比赢的钱还多。对其他小赌场您可以显示一下您的权力。那种小赌场更有害，更可恶。那些出了名的爱做手脚的人不敢到达官贵人的赌场上去耍手腕。赌博是一种通病，在大赌场赌就比在小赌场情况好。小赌场若是在后半夜逮着一个倒霉鬼，非得活剥了他的皮才算完。”\n “文书啊。”桑乔说，“现在我明白了，这里面还有不少说头呢。”\n 这时候，一个捕快揪着一个小伙子过来了。捕快说道：\n “总督大人，这个小伙子本来是朝咱们这儿走的。可他一看到咱们，转身就跑，而且跑得飞快，看样子是个罪犯。我在后面追，若不是他绊倒了，我恐怕还抓不着他呢。”\n “喂，你为什么跑呢？”桑乔问。\n 小伙子答道：\n “为了避免捕快们问的许多问题。”\n “你是干什么的？”\n “编织工人。”\n “编织什么？”\n “请您别见怪，织长矛上的铁枪头。”\n “你想跟我耍贫嘴？那好，你现在要到哪儿去？”\n “去透透空气。”\n “好，你这就说对了。小伙子，你还挺聪明。可是你要知道，我就是空气，就是吹你的，要把你吹到大牢去。把他抓起来，带步！我要让他今晚闷在大牢里睡觉！”\n “上帝保佑！”小伙子说，“您想让我在大牢里睡觉，那根本不可能。”\n “为什么我不能让你在大牢里睡觉？”桑乔问，“难道我没权力想抓你就抓，想放你就放吗？”\n “您就是再有权力，”小伙子说，“也不能叫我在大牢里睡觉。”\n “为什么不能？”桑乔说，“马上把他带走，让他亲身尝尝滋味就明白了。即使他买通了典狱长也不能放他。如果典狱长让你离开大牢一步，我就罚他两千杜卡多。”\n “这都是笑话，”小伙子说，“谁也不能让我在大牢里睡觉。”\n “告诉我，你这个魔鬼，”桑乔说，“我要给你戴上脚镣，难道有哪位天使能够去掉你的脚镣吗？”\n “好了，总督大人，”小伙子不慌不忙地说，“咱们现在论论理，说到正题上吧。假设您能够把我投入大牢，给我套上锁链脚镣，而且如果有哪个典狱长敢把我放出来，您就重罚他。可是我不睡觉，整夜都不睡觉，连眼皮都不眨一下，您有什么办法能让我睡觉呢？”\n “不能，”文书说，“这回他算是达到目的了。”\n “如果是这样，”桑乔说，“那是你自己不愿意睡，而不是跟我过不去。”\n “不是，大人，”小伙子说，“我绝没有想跟您过不去。”\n “滚蛋，”桑乔说，“回你的家睡觉去！愿上帝让你睡个好觉，我也不想阻止你睡个好觉。不过，我劝你以后别跟长官开玩笑，弄不好，玩笑就开到你脑袋上去了。”\n 小伙子走了，总督又继续巡视。不一会儿又来了两个捕快，还带来一个人。捕快说道：\n “总督大人，这个貌似男人的人不是男人，而是女人，长得不难看。她穿了一身男人的衣服。”\n 两三只灯笼一齐向那人的脸上照去，确实是一张女人的脸。看样子她有十六七岁。她的头发罩在一个高级的青丝线发网里，宛如无数珍球在闪烁。大家从上到下打量着她，只见她脚穿肉色丝袜，配着白塔夫绸袜带和珍珠串状的穗子，身穿高级面料的宽短裤和短外套，外套敞开着，露出里面的白色精纺面料的紧身坎肩，足登白色男鞋。她腰里别的不是剑，而是一把非常华贵的匕首，手指上还戴着许多贵重的戒指。大家都觉得她很漂亮，可是在场的人没有一个人认识她，都想不起她是谁，而那些明知这是一场戏弄桑乔的闹剧的人更是感到意外，因为他们并没有安排这件事。大家都迷惑不解，想看看事情会怎样发展。桑乔对这个姑娘的美貌很惊讶，问她是什么人，为什么穿这身衣服。姑娘低着头，十分羞涩地说道：\n “大人，我不能当着众人说这么重要的事情，这是我的秘密。不过有一点我想让您知道，那就是我既不是盗贼，也不是坏人，而是个不幸的姑娘，只是凭一时冲动，才做了这样不够庄重的事情。”\n 管家听姑娘这么一讲，便对桑乔说道：\n “总督大人，您让其他人走开，让这个姑娘放心大胆地讲讲她的事吧。”\n 于是，总督让其他人都走开，只留下管家、餐厅侍者和文书。姑娘见只剩下几个人了，便说道：\n “诸位大人，我是当地一个卖羊毛的佃户佩德罗·佩雷斯·马索卡的女儿，他常到我父亲家来。”\n “不对，姑娘，”管家说，“我跟佩德罗·佩雷斯很熟，知道他没有儿女。还有，你说他是你父亲，怎么又说他常到你父亲家？”\n “我早就注意到这点了。”桑乔说。\n “诸位大人，我现在心慌意乱，也不知道自己都说了些什么。”姑娘说，“实际上我是迭戈·德拉利亚纳的女儿，大概你们都认识他。”\n “这才对，”管家说，“我认识迭戈·德拉利亚纳，知道他是这儿一个有钱的贵族，有一儿一女。不过，自从他妻子死了以后，这儿就再也没人见过他女儿了。他把女儿关在家里，看管得紧紧的。尽管如此，我还是听说他女儿非常漂亮。”\n “是这样，”姑娘说，“我就是他的女儿。至于说我漂亮不漂亮，诸位大人，你们都已经看见我了，当然很清楚。”\n 接着，姑娘伤心地哭起来。管家见状就走到餐厅侍者身旁，对他耳语道：\n “这个可怜的姑娘肯定遇到了什么事，否则，如此尊贵人家的女孩子不会在这个时候这身打扮跑出来。”\n “没错，”餐厅侍者说，“她这一哭，更说明是这么回事了。”\n 桑乔竭力劝慰，让她别害怕，到底遇到了什么事，都告诉他，大家会尽可能地真心帮助她。\n “诸位大人，”姑娘说，“我母亲入土十年，我父亲就把我关在家里十年，连做弥撒也是在家里一个漂亮的小教堂里做。我从没有见过日月星辰，不知道大街、广场、庙宇是什么样子；除了父亲、我的一个弟弟和那个叫佩德罗·佩雷斯的佃户外，我也见不到其他男人。那个佃户常出入我家，所以我刚才突然想起说他是我父亲，以避免说出我父亲是谁。这样长期把我关在家里，不让我出门，连教堂都不让我去，使我特别伤心。我很想看看外面的世界，至少看看我出生的那个村镇，并且觉得这不会有失大家闺秀的身份。我一听说有什么斗牛、骑马打仗或演戏，就问我弟弟。弟弟比我小一岁，他告诉我这些都是怎么回事，还有其他许多事情，我都没见过。他说得绘声绘色，可这样一来，我更想到外面去看看了。干脆我简单点儿说，我为什么会弄成这个样子吧。我求我弟弟……我再也不会求人做这种事了……”\n 说到这儿她又哭起来。管家对她说道：\n “姑娘，你接着说吧，把你遇到的事都说出来。我们听了你的话，看到你流眼泪，都感到很惊讶。”\n “我没什么好多说的了，”姑娘道，“不过，眼泪倒是还有很多，随着非分的愿望而来的只能是眼泪。”\n 餐厅侍者对姑娘的美貌动了心，于是又把灯笼拿到姑娘脸前照了照。他觉得从姑娘眼睛里流出来的不是眼泪，而是珍珠、露珠，甚至可以说是东方大明珠。尽管姑娘又是哭又是叹气，他还是希望姑娘没遇到多大的不幸。总督对姑娘讲得罗罗嗦嗦有点儿不耐烦，让她赶紧讲那些最重要的事情，时间也不早了，他还有很多地方要去巡视呢。姑娘哽咽着说道：\n “我倒霉就倒霉在让弟弟借给我一身他的衣服，晚上趁父母都睡觉了，带我到整个村庄看看。他经不住我的恳求，给了我这身衣服。他穿上我的一身衣服，还挺合适。他还没长胡子，穿上我的衣服，挺像个漂亮的姑娘。今天晚上，我们出来大概一小时了，到处瞎转，走遍了整个村镇。后来我们正要回家，忽然看见来了一群人。弟弟对我说：‘姐姐，大概是巡夜的来了。你脚步轻点，赶紧跟我跑，若是让他们认出咱们来就糟了。’说完他转身就跑，他哪儿是跑呀，简直是飞。我慌慌张张地没跑几步就摔倒了。这时候捕快赶到了，就把我带到了您这儿。我太任性，所以才在众人面前出了丑。”\n “那么，小姐，”桑乔说，“你并没有遇到什么倒霉的事，也不像你开始说的那样，是一时冲动跑出来的？”\n “我没遇到什么事，也没有什么一时冲动，只不过是想看看外面的世界，看看这个地方的街道。”\n 姑娘的话得到了证实，捕快把她弟弟也带来了。他刚才与姐姐分手后很快就被捕快抓到了。他身着漂亮的短裙，披着一条有金银花边的蓝缎大披巾，头上没戴头巾，也没有什么头饰，只有一绺绺的金发。总督、管家和餐厅侍者把那男孩拉到一旁，为的是不让他姐姐听到他们说话。他们问这个男孩子为什么穿这身衣服。男孩子像姐姐一样不好意思。他把事情的原委讲了一下，同他姐姐讲的一样。餐厅侍者听了很高兴，而桑乔对姐弟两人说道：\n “孩子们，这只是一件小孩子淘气的事。这点事用不着讲那么半天，而且又是掉泪又叹气。你们只要说，我们是某某人，仅仅因为好奇，从家里跑出来转转，并没有其他目的’，也就完了，没必要唉声叹气、哭哭啼啼的。”\n “您说得对，”姑娘说，“可是要知道，我刚才吓坏了，不知怎么办才好。”\n “好在没什么事，”桑乔说，“走吧，我们送你们回家去。也许你们的父亲还不知道你们不在家呢。你们以后别再淘气了，也别老想看什么外面的世界了。一个正派姑娘，应该大门不出，二门不迈；‘女人和母鸡，迷路最容易’；‘想看别人，也就是想让别人看自己’。我不多说了。”\n 男孩子感谢总督的好意。两个孩子的家离那儿不远，大家一起走过去。来到家门前，男孩子往一个窗户上扔了一块卵石，立刻有个女佣出来开门。女佣一直在等他们。两人进去了。大家对姑娘的绰约风姿感到惊讶，对她竟想在深更半夜跑出来看外面的世界感到意外，但她毕竟是个孩子。餐厅侍者已经动了心，想改日再来向姑娘的父亲提亲。他觉得自己是公爵的佣人，姑娘的父亲肯定不会拒绝。其实，桑乔很想让他同自己的女儿桑奇卡结婚，正准备择日办理呢。桑乔觉得，对于总督的女儿来说，没有哪个男人会拒绝做她的丈夫。\n 当晚的巡视就此结束。两天之后，他的总督任职也结束了。他的打算全部落空了。请看下文。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4670.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote
