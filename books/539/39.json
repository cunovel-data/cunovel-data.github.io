{"id":42179,"no":39,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 38","content":"Continuing his discourse Don Quixote said: “As we began in the student’s case with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now if the soldier is richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself there is no one poorer; for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comes late or never, or else on what he can plunder, seriously imperilling his life and conscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great that a slashed doublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and in the depth of winter he has to defend himself against the inclemency of the weather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of his mouth, which I need not say, coming from an empty place, must come out cold, contrary to the laws of nature. To be sure he looks forward to the approach of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bed that awaits him, which, unless by some fault of his, never sins by being over narrow, for he can easily measure out on the ground as he likes, and roll himself about in it to his heart’s content without any fear of the sheets slipping away from him. Then, after all this, suppose the day and hour for taking his degree in his calling to have come; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, when they invest him with the doctor’s cap made of lint, to mend some bullet-hole, perhaps, that has gone through his temples, or left him with a crippled arm or leg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven watches over him and keeps him safe and sound, it may be he will be in the same poverty he was in before, and he must go through more engagements and more battles, and come victorious out of all before he betters himself; but miracles of that sort are seldom seen. For tell me, sirs, if you have ever reflected upon it, by how much do those who have gained by war fall short of the number of those who have perished in it? No doubt you will reply that there can be no comparison, that the dead cannot be numbered, while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up with three figures. All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters; for by skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means of support; so that though the soldier has more to endure, his reward is much less. But against all this it may be urged that it is easier to reward two thousand soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by giving them places, which must perforce be conferred upon men of their calling, while the latter can only be recompensed out of the very property of the master they serve; but this impossibility only strengthens my argument.\\n\\n “Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which it is difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority of arms over letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments put forward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters say that without them arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too, has its laws and is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain of letters and men of letters. To this arms make answer that without them laws cannot be maintained, for by arms states are defended, kingdoms preserved, cities protected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates; and, in short, if it were not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies, cities, ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and confusion which war brings with it, so long as it lasts and is free to make use of its privileges and powers. And then it is plain that whatever costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most. To attain to eminence in letters costs a man time, watching, hunger, nakedness, headaches, indigestions, and other things of the sort, some of which I have already referred to. But for a man to come in the ordinary course of things to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers, and in an incomparably higher degree, for at every step he runs the risk of losing his life. For what dread of want or poverty that can reach or harass the student can compare with what the soldier feels, who finds himself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin or cavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post where he is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances retire or fly from the imminent danger that threatens him? All he can do is to inform his captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by a counter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the moment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into the deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let us see whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys stem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one with the other, when the soldier has no more standing room than two feet of the plank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him threatening him as many ministers of death as there are cannon of the foe pointed at him, not a lance length from his body, and sees too that with the first heedless step he will go down to visit the profundities of Neptune’s bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that nerves him, he makes himself a target for all that musketry, and struggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy’s ship. And what is still more marvellous, no sooner has one gone down into the depths he will never rise from till the end of the world, than another takes his place; and if he too falls into the sea that waits for him like an enemy, another and another will succeed him without a moment’s pause between their deaths: courage and daring the greatest that all the chances of war can show. Happy the blest ages that knew not the dread fury of those devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I am persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention, by which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life of a gallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or whence, in the height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave hearts, there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by one who fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine, which in an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life of one who deserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I reflect on this, I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having adopted this profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we live in now; for though no peril can make me fear, still it gives me some uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the opportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout the known earth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword. But Heaven’s will be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more honoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of yore exposed themselves to.”\\n\\n All this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the others supped, forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips, though Sancho more than once told him to eat his supper, as he would have time enough afterwards to say all he wanted. It excited fresh pity in those who had heard him to see a man of apparently sound sense, and with rational views on every subject he discussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, when his wretched unlucky chivalry was in question. The curate told him he was quite right in all he had said in favour of arms, and that he himself, though a man of letters and a graduate, was of the same opinion.\\n\\n They finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the hostess, her daughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of La Mancha’s garret ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to be quartered by themselves for the night, Don Fernando begged the captive to tell them the story of his life, for it could not fail to be strange and interesting, to judge by the hints he had let fall on his arrival in company with Zoraida. To this the captive replied that he would very willingly yield to his request, only he feared his tale would not give them as much pleasure as he wished; nevertheless, not to be wanting in compliance, he would tell it. The curate and the others thanked him and added their entreaties, and he finding himself so pressed said there was no occasion ask, where a command had such weight, and added, “If your worships will give me your attention you will hear a true story which, perhaps, fictitious ones constructed with ingenious and studied art cannot come up to.” These words made them settle themselves in their places and preserve a deep silence, and he seeing them waiting on his words in mute expectation, began thus in a pleasant quiet voice.\\n\\n \\n\\n 唐吉诃德接着说：\\n\\n “我们刚才谈到了文人学士的清苦和他们这方面的其它情况，我们再来看看他们是否比士兵有钱。我们可以看到，没有人比士兵更清苦了。他们靠的只是菲薄的军饷，而且这军饷还晚发或不发。有的就靠动手去抢，可这就得冒丧失性命和良心的极大危险。有时候简直衣不蔽体，一件破了洞的上衣既当礼服，又当衬衫。在严冬他们常常冒着酷寒在野外露宿，只能靠嘴里的哈气御寒。可是气出自空腹，据我了解，与常规相反，呼出的是凉气。他们等啊等，想等到天黑在床上暖和暖和。只要他们不是跟自己过意不去，床倒是肯定窄不了，只要他们的脚走得到，都可以算是床，可以在上面尽情翻滚，不用担心床单掉地。\\n\\n “就这样，到了他们接受军阶的日子。有一天，战斗来临了。他们每个人头上戴着线做的帽缨，以便万一子弹打到太阳穴上或者打断胳膊和腿的时候治伤用。即使仁慈的老天让他们没有遇上这种情况，安然无恙，他们仍然同以往一样，一贫如洗，然后又得一次次地集合，一次次地战斗。即使他们每次都打了胜仗，也只能得到一点儿好处。而且这种奇迹极为罕见。\\n\\n “诸位大人，你们是否发现，为打战而受奖的人要比战死的人少得多？你们肯定会说这无法相比，因为死者不计其数，而得奖的人不过三位数。但文人的情况相反，不管怎么样，他们至少表面上有维持生计的手段。虽然战士们付出的代价大，可是得到的奖励却很少。据说，奖励两千个文人要比奖励三万个士兵容易得多，因为奖励前者，只需给他们一个符合他们专业的职位就行了，而要奖励后者，只能靠他们为之效力的那个人的财力。这是难以做到的，可它又进一步证明了我说的道理。咱们暂且不谈这些，这是个难以解开的谜团，还是谈谈武装比文治的重要性吧。这个问题还有待考证，因为各方都坚持己见。文士们认为，没有文治，武装就不可能生存，因为战争也有自己的法则，而法则是由文士完成的，法则受到文化和文人的制约。\\n\\n “可武官对此的回答是，如果没有武装力量的支持，法则是不可能存在的，因为保卫国家、维护王国、保护城市、保证道路交通、清除海盗，这一切都离不开武装力量。如果没有武装力量，民主国家、王国、帝国、城市、海路和陆路都会遭受战争所带来的灾难与混乱。谁付出的代价越多就越重要，就越应该受到重视，这是显而易见的道理。谁要想在文化方面表现得突出，就得花费时间，熬夜不眠，忍饥挨饿，缺衣少穿，头脑发胀，消化不良，还有其它一些与此相关的事情，有一些刚才我已经谈到了。可是按照另外一些人的说法，谁要想成为好战士，同样要付出上面所说的代价，而且程度还更严重，简直无法比拟，因为他们随时都有丧失生命的危险。\\n\\n “文人面临的危险和清苦怎能和战士相比呢？战士们被围困在某个碉堡或工事里，站岗值班，知道敌人正在向他所在的地方挖坑道，可他无论如何不能离开，也不能逃避这近在咫尺的危险。他只能把发生的情况向班长报告，以便采取对策，可他自己只能留在那里，心惊胆战地等待着自己不知什么时候会突然身不由己地飞上天或者掉进地底下去。如果这个危险还不算大，我们不妨看看两只军舰在辽阔的大海上对撞是否能与之相比，或者比这更厉害吧。两只船碰撞在一起，战士们只能在船头的冲角上有两尺宽的立足之地。尽管他们看到敌方舰上的枪炮离自己的身体仅有一支长矛的距离，正像死神一样威胁着自己的生命，脚下一不小心还会掉到涅普图努斯①的肚子里去，但他们仍然被荣誉感激励着，勇猛向前，迎着枪弹，企图跃到敌舰上去。更令人钦佩的是，一个人刚刚倒下去，掉进无底深渊，另一个人立刻补充了他的位置。如果这个人也掉进海里，就好像大海在等待它的对手似的，后面一个又一个的人紧接着冲上去，英勇赴死。这是所有战争中最壮观的情景。\\n\\n ①涅普图努斯原为罗马水神，同希腊神波塞冬混同后成为海神。\\n\\n “没有凶恶火器的年代该是多么幸福啊，对于这些火器的发明者，我看他们的罪恶的发明也正在地狱里等着要惩罚他们呢。这种发明使得一些无耻的胆小鬼可以夺取一个勇士的生命。一个意气风发、豪情满怀的战士，可能在转瞬间糊里糊涂地被一颗流弹夺走思想和生命。他本来应该生命长存，而那个射击的家伙却可能早已被这个可恶的东西发射时出现的火光吓跑了呢。由此想来，我不禁在心里为我在这个应该遭到唾弃的年代里当游侠骑士感到心情沉重。尽管任何危险也吓不倒我，可是一想到火药和铅弹可能会夺走我依靠臂膀的力量和短剑的锋刃在世界上扬名的机会，我就不禁火冒三丈。\\n\\n “不过还是听天由命吧，即使我面临的危险比过去的所有游侠骑士面临的危险还要大，只要我能做到我要做的事情，我还是会受到比他们更多的尊重。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德侃侃而谈，其他吃饭的人竟忘了把食物放进嘴里。桑乔几次催大家吃饭，说吃完饭，大家愿意怎么说就怎么说。在场的人忽然对唐吉诃德添了几分恻隐之心。看起来唐吉诃德的思路很清楚，可一说起骑士乌七八糟的事情就简直不可救药了。神甫说唐吉诃德为武士们的辩解很有道理。他自己虽然属于文职人员，也同意他的看法。\\n\\n 吃完晚饭，撤去了桌子，客店主妇、她的女儿和丑女仆就去收拾唐吉诃德的那间顶楼。他们决定那间房子当晚给所有女人住。费尔南多让俘虏讲讲他的生活经历。看他陪索赖达来时的那个样子，他的经历一定很有趣。俘虏说很愿意听从费尔南多的吩咐，只是怕自己讲得不像他们希望的那样有趣。尽管如此，他还是遵命，以后会讲的。神甫和其他人表示感谢，并再次请求他现在就讲。俘虏见大家请求他说，说不用求，只要吩咐就行。\\n\\n “既然这样，你们诸位就注意听。这是真事，那些精心编造的故事也许还不如它好听呢。”\\n\\n 他让大家坐好，别再说话了。他见大家不再吱声，等着他讲，就开始以柔和平稳的语调讲起来。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4606.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
