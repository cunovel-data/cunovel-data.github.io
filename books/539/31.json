{"id":42171,"no":31,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 30","content":"The curate had hardly ceased speaking, when Sancho said, “In faith, then, senor licentiate, he who did that deed was my master; and it was not for want of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what he was about, and that it was a sin to set them at liberty, as they were all on the march there because they were special scoundrels.”\n “Blockhead!” said Don Quixote at this, “it is no business or concern of knights-errant to inquire whether any persons in affliction, in chains, or oppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way and suffer as they do because of their faults or because of their misfortunes. It only concerns them to aid them as persons in need of help, having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities. I encountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people, and did for them what my sense of duty demands of me, and as for the rest be that as it may; and whoever takes objection to it, saving the sacred dignity of the senor licentiate and his honoured person, I say he knows little about chivalry and lies like a whoreson villain, and this I will give him to know to the fullest extent with my sword;” and so saying he settled himself in his stirrups and pressed down his morion; for the barber’s basin, which according to him was Mambrino’s helmet, he carried hanging at the saddle-bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley slaves.\n Dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly understood Don Quixote’s crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza were making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on observing his irritation, “Sir Knight, remember the boon you have promised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any other adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the licentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that unconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or even bitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word that tended towards disrespect of your worship.”\n “That I swear heartily,” said the curate, “and I would have even plucked off a moustache.”\n “I will hold my peace, senora,” said Don Quixote, “and I will curb the natural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace and quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this consideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do so, what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are the persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am to take vengeance on your behalf?”\n “That I will do with all my heart,” replied Dorothea, “if it will not be wearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes.”\n “It will not be wearisome, senora,” said Don Quixote; to which Dorothea replied, “Well, if that be so, give me your attention.” As soon as she said this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to hear what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent for herself; and Sancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her as his master; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle, and with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think, began with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion.\n “First of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is — ” and here she stopped for a moment, for she forgot the name the curate had given her; but he came to her relief, seeing what her difficulty was, and said, “It is no wonder, senora, that your highness should be confused and embarrassed in telling the tale of your misfortunes; for such afflictions often have the effect of depriving the sufferers of memory, so that they do not even remember their own names, as is the case now with your ladyship, who has forgotten that she is called the Princess Micomicona, lawful heiress of the great kingdom of Micomicon; and with this cue your highness may now recall to your sorrowful recollection all you may wish to tell us.”\n “That is the truth,” said the damsel; “but I think from this on I shall have no need of any prompting, and I shall bring my true story safe into port, and here it is. The king my father, who was called Tinacrio the Sapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and became aware by his craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was to die before he did, and that soon after he too was to depart this life, and I was to be left an orphan without father or mother. But all this, he declared, did not so much grieve or distress him as his certain knowledge that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island close to our kingdom, Pandafilando of the Scowl by name — for it is averred that, though his eyes are properly placed and straight, he always looks askew as if he squinted, and this he does out of malignity, to strike fear and terror into those he looks at — that he knew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of my orphan condition would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me of all, not leaving me even a small village to shelter me; but that I could avoid all this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him; however, as far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent to a marriage so unequal; and he said no more than the truth in this, for it has never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him be ever so great or enormous. My father said, too, that when he was dead, and I saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait and attempt to defend myself, for that would be destructive to me, but that I should leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to avoid the death and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for there would be no possibility of defending myself against the giant’s devilish power; and that I should at once with some of my followers set out for Spain, where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a certain knight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over the whole kingdom, and who would be called, if I remember rightly, Don Azote or Don Gigote.”\n “‘Don Quixote,’ he must have said, senora,” observed Sancho at this, “otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.”\n “That is it,” said Dorothea; “he said, moreover, that he would be tall of stature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the left shoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs like bristles.”\n On hearing this, Don Quixote said to his squire, “Here, Sancho my son, bear a hand and help me to strip, for I want to see if I am the knight that sage king foretold.”\n “What does your worship want to strip for?” said Dorothea.\n “To see if I have that mole your father spoke of,” answered Don Quixote.\n “There is no occasion to strip,” said Sancho; “for I know your worship has just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark of a strong man.”\n “That is enough,” said Dorothea, “for with friends we must not look too closely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the backbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where it may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the truth in every particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending myself to Don Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the features of his countenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that wide fame he has acquired not only in Spain but in all La Mancha; for I had scarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such accounts of his achievements, that at once my heart told me he was the very one I had come in search of.”\n “But how did you land at Osuna, senora,” asked Don Quixote, “when it is not a seaport?”\n But before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying, “The princess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga the first place where she heard of your worship was Osuna.”\n “That is what I meant to say,” said Dorothea.\n “And that would be only natural,” said the curate. “Will your majesty please proceed?”\n “There is no more to add,” said Dorothea, “save that in finding Don Quixote I have had such good fortune, that I already reckon and regard myself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his courtesy and magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying me whithersoever I may conduct him, which will be only to bring him face to face with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him and restore to me what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must come to pass satisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient foretold it, who likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or Greek characters (for I cannot read them), that if this predicted knight, after having cut the giant’s throat, should be disposed to marry me I was to offer myself at once without demur as his lawful wife, and yield him possession of my kingdom together with my person.”\n “What thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?” said Don Quixote at this. “Hearest thou that? Did I not tell thee so? See how we have already got a kingdom to govern and a queen to marry!”\n “On my oath it is so,” said Sancho; “and foul fortune to him who won’t marry after slitting Senor Pandahilado’s windpipe! And then, how illfavoured the queen is! I wish the fleas in my bed were that sort!”\n And so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign of extreme satisfaction, and then ran to seize the bridle of Dorothea’s mule, and checking it fell on his knees before her, begging her to give him her hand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen and mistress. Which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see the madness of the master and the simplicity of the servant? Dorothea therefore gave her hand, and promised to make him a great lord in her kingdom, when Heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover and enjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words that set them all laughing again.\n “This, sirs,” continued Dorothea, “is my story; it only remains to tell you that of all the attendants I took with me from my kingdom I have none left except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned in a great tempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he and I came to land on a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the whole course of my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed; and if I have been over minute in any respect or not as precise as I ought, let it be accounted for by what the licentiate said at the beginning of my tale, that constant and excessive troubles deprive the sufferers of their memory.”\n “They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,” said Don Quixote, “however great and unexampled those which I shall endure in your service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I have promised you, and I swear to go with you to the end of the world until I find myself in the presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head I trust by the aid of my arm to cut off with the edge of this — I will not say good sword, thanks to Gines de Pasamonte who carried away mine” — (this he said between his teeth, and then continued), “and when it has been cut off and you have been put in peaceful possession of your realm it shall be left to your own decision to dispose of your person as may be most pleasing to you; for so long as my memory is occupied, my will enslaved, and my understanding enthralled by her — I say no more — it is impossible for me for a moment to contemplate marriage, even with a Phoenix.”\n The last words of his master about not wanting to marry were so disagreeable to Sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with great irritation:\n “By my oath, Senor Don Quixote, you are not in your right senses; for how can your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted princess as this? Do you think Fortune will offer you behind every stone such a piece of luck as is offered you now? Is my lady Dulcinea fairer, perchance? Not she; nor half as fair; and I will even go so far as to say she does not come up to the shoe of this one here. A poor chance I have of getting that county I am waiting for if your worship goes looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea. In the devil’s name, marry, marry, and take this kingdom that comes to hand without any trouble, and when you are king make me a marquis or governor of a province, and for the rest let the devil take it all.”\n Don Quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his lady Dulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his pike, without saying anything to Sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacks that he brought him to the ground; and had it not been that Dorothea cried out to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on the spot.\n “Do you think,” he said to him after a pause, “you scurvy clown, that you are to be always interfering with me, and that you are to be always offending and I always pardoning? Don’t fancy it, impious scoundrel, for that beyond a doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going against the peerless Dulcinea. Know you not, lout, vagabond, beggar, that were it not for the might that she infuses into my arm I should not have strength enough to kill a flea? Say, scoffer with a viper’s tongue, what think you has won this kingdom and cut off this giant’s head and made you a marquis (for all this I count as already accomplished and decided), but the might of Dulcinea, employing my arm as the instrument of her achievements? She fights in me and conquers in me, and I live and breathe in her, and owe my life and being to her. O whoreson scoundrel, how ungrateful you are, you see yourself raised from the dust of the earth to be a titled lord, and the return you make for so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who has conferred it upon you!”\n Sancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said, and rising with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behind Dorothea’s palfrey, and from that position he said to his master:\n “Tell me, senor; if your worship is resolved not to marry this great princess, it is plain the kingdom will not be yours; and not being so, how can you bestow favours upon me? That is what I complain of. Let your worship at any rate marry this queen, now that we have got her here as if showered down from heaven, and afterwards you may go back to my lady Dulcinea; for there must have been kings in the world who kept mistresses. As to beauty, I have nothing to do with it; and if the truth is to be told, I like them both; though I have never seen the lady Dulcinea.”\n “How! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!” exclaimed Don Quixote; “hast thou not just now brought me a message from her?”\n “I mean,” said Sancho, “that I did not see her so much at my leisure that I could take particular notice of her beauty, or of her charms piecemeal; but taken in the lump I like her.”\n “Now I forgive thee,” said Don Quixote; “and do thou forgive me the injury I have done thee; for our first impulses are not in our control.”\n “That I see,” replied Sancho, “and with me the wish to speak is always the first impulse, and I cannot help saying, once at any rate, what I have on the tip of my tongue.”\n “For all that, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “take heed of what thou sayest, for the pitcher goes so often to the well — I need say no more to thee.”\n “Well, well,” said Sancho, “God is in heaven, and sees all tricks, and will judge who does most harm, I in not speaking right, or your worship in not doing it.”\n “That is enough,” said Dorothea; “run, Sancho, and kiss your lord’s hand and beg his pardon, and henceforward be more circumspect with your praise and abuse; and say nothing in disparagement of that lady Toboso, of whom I know nothing save that I am her servant; and put your trust in God, for you will not fail to obtain some dignity so as to live like a prince.”\n Sancho advanced hanging his head and begged his master’s hand, which Don Quixote with dignity presented to him, giving him his blessing as soon as he had kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little, as he had questions to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him. Sancho obeyed, and when the two had gone some distance in advance Don Quixote said to him, “Since thy return I have had no opportunity or time to ask thee many particulars touching thy mission and the answer thou hast brought back, and now that chance has granted us the time and opportunity, deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good news.”\n “Let your worship ask what you will,” answered Sancho, “for I shall find a way out of all as I found a way in; but I implore you, senor, not not to be so revengeful in future.”\n “Why dost thou say that, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.\n “I say it,” he returned, “because those blows just now were more because of the quarrel the devil stirred up between us both the other night, than for what I said against my lady Dulcinea, whom I love and reverence as I would a relic — though there is nothing of that about her — merely as something belonging to your worship.”\n “Say no more on that subject for thy life, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “for it is displeasing to me; I have already pardoned thee for that, and thou knowest the common saying, ‘for a fresh sin a fresh penance.’”\n While this was going on they saw coming along the road they were following a man mounted on an ass, who when he came close seemed to be a gipsy; but Sancho Panza, whose eyes and heart were there wherever he saw asses, no sooner beheld the man than he knew him to be Gines de Pasamonte; and by the thread of the gipsy he got at the ball, his ass, for it was, in fact, Dapple that carried Pasamonte, who to escape recognition and to sell the ass had disguised himself as a gipsy, being able to speak the gipsy language, and many more, as well as if they were his own. Sancho saw him and recognised him, and the instant he did so he shouted to him, “Ginesillo, you thief, give up my treasure, release my life, embarrass thyself not with my repose, quit my ass, leave my delight, be off, rip, get thee gone, thief, and give up what is not thine.”\n There was no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at the first one Gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off and got clear of them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and embracing him he said, “How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my comrade?” all the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a human being. The ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed and caressed by Sancho without answering a single word. They all came up and congratulated him on having found Dapple, Don Quixote especially, who told him that notwithstanding this he would not cancel the order for the three ass-colts, for which Sancho thanked him.\n While the two had been going along conversing in this fashion, the curate observed to Dorothea that she had shown great cleverness, as well in the story itself as in its conciseness, and the resemblance it bore to those of the books of chivalry. She said that she had many times amused herself reading them; but that she did not know the situation of the provinces or seaports, and so she had said at haphazard that she had landed at Osuna.\n “So I saw,” said the curate, “and for that reason I made haste to say what I did, by which it was all set right. But is it not a strange thing to see how readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these figments and lies, simply because they are in the style and manner of the absurdities of his books?”\n “So it is,” said Cardenio; “and so uncommon and unexampled, that were one to attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction, I doubt if there be any wit keen enough to imagine it.”\n “But another strange thing about it,” said the curate, “is that, apart from the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection with his craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss them in a perfectly rational manner, showing that his mind is quite clear and composed; so that, provided his chivalry is not touched upon, no one would take him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound understanding.”\n While they were holding this conversation Don Quixote continued his with Sancho, saying:\n “Friend Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell me now, dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst thou find Dulcinea? What was she doing? What didst thou say to her? What did she answer? How did she look when she was reading my letter? Who copied it out for thee? and everything in the matter that seems to thee worth knowing, asking, and learning; neither adding nor falsifying to give me pleasure, nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me of it.”\n “Senor,” replied Sancho, “if the truth is to be told, nobody copied out the letter for me, for I carried no letter at all.”\n “It is as thou sayest,” said Don Quixote, “for the note-book in which I wrote it I found in my own possession two days after thy departure, which gave me very great vexation, as I knew not what thou wouldst do on finding thyself without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldst return from the place where thou didst first miss it.”\n “So I should have done,” said Sancho, “if I had not got it by heart when your worship read it to me, so that I repeated it to a sacristan, who copied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that he said in all the days of his life, though he had read many a letter of excommunication, he had never seen or read so pretty a letter as that.”\n “And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?” said Don Quixote.\n “No, senor,” replied Sancho, “for as soon as I had repeated it, seeing there was no further use for it, I set about forgetting it; and if I recollect any of it, it is that about ‘Scrubbing,‘I mean to say ‘Sovereign Lady,’ and the end ‘Yours till death, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance;’ and between these two I put into it more than three hundred ‘my souls’ and ‘my life’s ‘ and ‘my eyes.”\n \n 神甫还没讲完，桑乔就说：“依我看，教士大人，做这事的就是我主人。我事先并不是没有提醒他，而且让他当心自己在干什么，那些人都是江洋大盗，给他们自由就是造孽。”\n “你这个蠢货，”唐吉诃德这时说话了，“游侠骑士在路上遇到受苦受罪、身带锁链、失去了自由的人，无须去了解他们原来做的事是对还是错。游侠骑士注意的是他们正在受苦，而不是他们犯过什么罪。他们要做的就是帮助受苦人。我碰到的是一队垂头丧气、痛苦不堪的人。是我的信仰要求我这样做的，否则我才不管呢。那些说我做得不对的人，除了神圣威严、品行端方的神甫大人外，我只能说，他们对骑士的事所知甚少，就像卑贱的小人一样信口雌黄。我会用我的剑让他明白这点，以儆效尤。”\n 唐吉诃德在马上坐定，又把头盔戴上。那个头盔本是理发师的铜盆，可他非认定那是曼布里诺的头盔不可，虽然被苦役犯砸扁了，却仍一直挂在鞍头上，等待机会修理呢。\n 机灵而又风趣的多罗特亚对唐吉诃德的愚蠢可笑行为早有耳闻，而且知道除了桑乔之外，大家都是在拿唐吉诃德取笑。于是她也不甘落后，见唐吉诃德已怒气冲冲，便说道：\n “骑士大人，您可别忘了，您答应在给我帮忙之前，即使再紧急的事情也不参与。请您消消气，假如神甫大人知道是您放了那些苦役犯，他就是再忍不住，也会守口如瓶，不至于说出那些有损您尊严的话来的。”\n “我发誓是这样，”神甫说，“我甚至可以扯掉一绺胡子来证明这点。”\n “那我就不说什么了，我的公主。”唐吉诃德说，“我会强压我胸中已经燃起的怒火，在完成我答应要帮您做的事情之前一直心平气和。不过，作为对我这种友好表示的回报，我请求您，如果没有什么不便的话，请您告诉我，是什么事让您如此悲愤。我要向他们理所当然地、痛痛快快地、毫不留情地报仇。那些人一共有多少，都是些什么人？”\n “要是这些可怜和不幸的事情不会惹您生气，我很愿意讲。”多罗特亚说。\n “我不会生气，我的小姐。”唐吉诃德说。\n 于是，多罗特亚说：\n “既然如此，那你们都仔细听着。”\n 她这么一说，卡德尼奥和理发师都赶紧凑到她身边，想听听这位机灵的多罗特亚如何编造她的故事。桑乔也很想听，不过他同唐吉诃德一样，仍被蒙在鼓里。多罗特亚在马鞍上坐稳后，咳嗽了一声，又装模作样一番，才十分潇洒地讲起来：\n “首先，我要告诉诸位大人，我叫……”\n 说到这儿，她顿了一下，因为她忘记了神甫给她起的是什么名字。不过，神甫已经意识到是怎么回事了，赶紧过来解围，说：\n “我的公主，您一谈起自己的不幸就不知所措，羞愧难当，这并不奇怪。深重的痛苦常常会损害人的记忆力，甚至让人忘记了自己的名字，就像您刚才那样，忘记了自己是米科米科娜公主，是米科米孔伟大王国的合法继承人。这么一提醒，您自然会十分容易地回想您的悲伤往事，就可以讲下去了。”\n “是的，”姑娘说，“我觉得从现在起，我不再需要任何提醒，完全可以顺利地讲完我的故事了。我的父亲蒂纳克里奥国王是位先知，很精通魔法，算出来我的母亲哈拉米利亚王后将先于他去世，而且他不久也会故世，那么我就成了孤儿。不过，他说最让他担心的还不是这些，而是他断定有个超级巨人管辖着一个几乎与我们王国毗邻的大岛，他名叫横眉怒目的潘达菲兰多。听说他的眼睛虽然长得很正，可是看东西的时候，眼珠总是朝两边看，像个斜眼人。他就用这对眼睛作恶，凡是看见他的人无不感到恐惧。父亲说，这个巨人知道我成了孤儿，就会大兵压境，夺走一切，甚至不留一个小村庄让我安身。不过，只要我同他结婚，这一灭顶之灾就可以避免。然而父亲也知道，这样不般配的姻缘，我肯定不愿意。父亲说得完全对，我从来没想过和那样的巨人结婚，而且也不会同其他巨人结婚，无论巨人是多么高大，多么凶狠。\n “父亲还说，他死后，潘达菲兰多就会进犯我们的王国，我不要被动防御，那是坐以待毙。如果我想让善良忠实的臣民不被彻底消灭，就得把王国拱手让给他，我们根本无法抵御那巨人的可怕力量。我可以带着几个手下人奔赴西班牙，去向一位游侠骑士求救。那位游侠骑士的大名在我们整个王国众所周知，如果我没记错的话，他的名字大概叫唐阿索德或唐希戈德。”\n “您大概是说唐吉诃德，公主，”桑乔这时插嘴道，“他还有个名字，叫猥獕骑士。”\n “是这样，”多罗特亚说，“父亲还说，那位骑士大概是高高的身材，干瘪脸，他的左肩下面或者旁边有一颗黑痣，上面还有几根像鬃一样的汗毛。”\n 唐吉诃德闻言对桑乔说：\n “过来，桑乔，亲爱的，你帮我把衣服脱下来，我要看看我是不是先知国王说的那个骑士。”\n “可您为什么要脱衣服呢？”多罗特亚问。\n “我想看看我是否有你父亲说的那颗黑痣。”唐吉诃德说。\n “那也没有必要脱衣服，”桑乔说，“我知道在您脊梁中间的部位有一颗那样的痣，那是身体强壮的表现。”\n “这就行了，”多罗特亚说，“朋友之间何必认真，究竟是在肩膀还是在脊柱上并不重要，只要知道有颗痣就行了，在哪儿都一样，反正是在一个人身上。我的好父亲说得完全对，我向唐吉诃德大人求救也找对了，您就是我父亲说的那个人。您脸上的特征证明您就是那位大名鼎鼎的骑士。您的大名不仅在西班牙，而且在曼查也是尽人皆知。我在奥苏纳一下船①，就听说了您的事迹，我马上预感到这就是我要找的人了。”\n ①这里多罗特亚不熟悉地理，以为曼查比西班牙更大，还以为奥苏纳是海港。\n “可您为什么会在奥苏纳下船呢？”唐吉诃德问，“那里并不是海港呀。”\n 不等多罗特亚回答，神甫就抢过来说：\n “公主大概是想说，她从马拉加下船后，第一次听说您的事迹是在奥苏纳。”\n “我正是这个意思。”多罗特亚说。\n “这就对了，”神甫说，“您接着讲下去。”\n “没什么好讲的了。”多罗特亚说，“我真走运，找到了唐吉诃德。我觉得我已经是我的王国的女王或主人了，因为谦恭豪爽的他已经答应随我到任何地方去。我会把他带到横眉怒目的潘达菲兰多那儿，把那巨人杀了，重新恢复我那被无理夺取的王国。这件事只要我一开口请求，就可以做到，对这点我的好父亲蒂纳克里奥先知早就预见到了。父亲还用我看不懂的迦勒底文或是希腊文留下了字据，说杀死那个巨人后，骑士若有意同我结婚，我应当毫无异议地同意做他的合法妻子，把我的王国连同我本人一同交给他。”\n “怎么样，桑乔朋友，”唐吉诃德这时说，“你没听到她刚才说的吗？我难道没对你说过吗？你看，咱们是不是已经有了可以掌管的王国，有了可以娶为妻子的女王？”\n “我发誓，”桑乔说，“如果扭断潘达菲兰多的脖子后不同女王结婚，他就是婊子养的！同样，女王如果不结婚也不是好女王！\n 女王真漂亮！”\n 说完桑乔跳跃了两下，显出欣喜若狂的样子，然后拉住多罗特亚那头骡子的缰绳，跪倒在多罗特亚面前，请求她把手伸出来让自己吻一下，表示自己承认她为自己的女王和女主人，接着又千恩万谢地说了一番，把在场的人都逗笑了。\n “各位大人，”多罗特亚说，“这就是我的故事。现在我要说的就是所有随同我从王国逃出来的人，除了这位大胡子侍从外，已经一个都不剩了，他们都在港口那儿遇到的一场暴风雨中淹死了，只有这位侍从和我靠着两块木板奇迹般地上了岸。你们大概注意到了，我的生活始终充满了奇迹和神秘。如果有些事说得过分或者不准确的话，那就像我刚开始讲时神甫大人说的那样，持续不断的巨大痛苦会损害人的记忆力。”\n “但是损害不了我的记忆力，勇敢高贵的公主！”唐吉诃德说，“无论碰到什么样的事情，无论有多么严重，多么罕见，我都一定为您效劳。我再次重申我对您的承诺，发誓即使走到天涯海角，我也始终追随您，一直到找到您那凶猛的敌人。我想靠上帝和我的臂膀，把他那高傲的脑袋割下来，就用这把利剑……现在我不能再说这是一把利剑了，我的利剑被希内斯·帕萨蒙特拿走了。”\n 唐吉诃德嘀咕了这么一句，又接着说下去：\n “把巨人的头割掉之后，您又可以过太平日子了，那时候您就可以任意做您想做的任何事情。而我呢，记忆犹存，心向意中人，无意再恋……我不说了，反正我不可能结婚，甚至也不去想结婚的事，哪怕是同天仙美女。”\n 桑乔觉得主人最后说不想结婚太可恶了。他很生气，提高了嗓门，说：\n “我发誓，唐吉诃德大人，您真是头脑不正常。同这样一位高贵的公主结婚，您还有什么可犹豫的？您以为每次都能碰到像今天这样的好事吗？难道杜尔西内亚小姐比她还漂亮？不比她漂亮，一半都不如。我甚至敢说，比起现在您面前的这位公主来，她简直望尘莫及。如果您还心存疑虑，我想当个伯爵也就没什么指望了。您结婚吧，马上结婚吧，我会请求魔鬼让您结婚。您得了这个送上门的王国，当上国王，也该让我当个侯爵或总督，然后您就随便怎么样吧。”\n 唐吉诃德听到桑乔竟如此侮辱他的杜尔西内亚，实在忍无可忍，他二话不说，举起长矛打了桑乔两下，把他打倒在地。若不是多罗特亚高喊不要打，桑乔就没命了。\n “可恶的乡巴佬，”唐吉诃德过了一会儿又说，“你以为我总让你这么放肆吗？总让你办了错事再饶你吗？休想！你这个无耻的异己分子，你肯定已经被逐出教会了，否则你怎么敢说天下绝伦的杜尔西内亚的坏话！你这个笨蛋、下人、无赖，如果不是她给我力量，我能打死一只跳蚤吗？你说，你这个爱说闲话的狡诈之徒，如果不是大智大勇的杜尔西内亚通过我的手建立她的功绩，你能想象我们会夺取这个王国，割掉那个巨人的头，让你当伯爵吗？事实确凿，不容置疑。她通过我去拚搏，去取胜，我仰仗她休养生息。你这个流氓、恶棍，怎么能如此忘恩负义，一旦平步青去，受封晋爵，就以诽谤来回报一直扶植你的人呢！”\n 桑乔被打得晕头转向，并没有完全听清主人对他说的话。不过他还算机灵，从地上爬起来，躲到多罗特亚的坐骑后面，对唐吉诃德说：\n “您说吧，大人，要是您决意不同这位高贵的公主结婚，那么王国肯定就不是您的了。如果是这样，您有什么能赏赐给我呢？我就是抱怨这个。这位女王简直就像从天而降，您赶紧同她结婚吧，然后，您还可以去找我们的杜尔西内亚，在这个世界上，姘居的国王大概是有的。至于她们的相貌，我就不妄言了，不过，要是让我说的话，我觉得两个人都不错，虽然我并没有见过杜尔西内亚夫人。”\n “你怎么会没见过呢，无耻的叛徒。”唐吉诃德说，“你不是刚刚从她那儿给我带信来吗？”\n “我是说，我并没有仔细看她的美貌，”桑乔说，“没能认真看她那些漂亮的部位，只是大体上看了，我觉得还不错。”\n “现在我向你道歉，”唐吉诃德说，“请原谅我对你发脾气。\n 刚才我一时冲动，按捺不住。”\n “我也是，”桑乔说，“一时心血来潮，就想说点什么。而且只要我想说，就非得说出来不可。”\n “可也是，”唐吉诃德说，“你看你总是说，桑乔，喋喋不休，难免……行了，我不说了。”\n “那好，”桑乔说，“上帝在天上看得清楚，就让上帝来裁判吧，究竟是谁最坏，是我说的最坏，还是您做的最坏。”\n “别再没完了，”多罗特亚说，“桑乔，过去吻你主人的手吧，请他原谅，从今以后，你无论是赞扬还是诅咒什么，都注意点儿，别再说那位托博索夫人的坏话了。我虽然并不认识她，却愿意为她效劳。你相信上帝，肯定会封给你一块领地，你可以在那儿生活得极其优裕。”\n 桑乔低着头走过去，请求主人把手伸给他。唐吉诃德很矜持地把手伸出来，待桑乔吻完并为他祝福后，又让桑乔和他往前走一点儿，因为有很重要的事要同他谈。桑乔往前赶了几步，唐吉诃德随后过去，对桑乔说：\n “自从你回来后，我一直没有机会问你有关我让你带的信和你带来的回信之事。现在天赐良机，你别错过这个告诉我好消息的良机。”\n “您随便问，”桑乔说，“我都会应答自如。不过我请求您，我的大人，以后别再那么记仇了。”\n “你为什么这么说，桑乔？”唐吉诃德问。\n “我这么说，”桑乔说，“是因为您刚才打我那几下，主要还是由于那天晚上我说了杜尔西内亚的坏话。其实我像对圣物那样热爱她，尊重她，虽然她并不是圣物，这全都因为她是属于您的。”\n “你小心点儿，别转话题，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“这会让我不痛快。我原谅你，你要知道人们常说的，‘重新犯罪，重新忏悔’。”\n 正说着，路上有个人骑着驴迎面走过来了，走近才看出是个吉卜赛人。桑乔无论到什么地方，只要有驴，他都要仔细看个究竟。他一下子就认出那人是希内斯·帕萨蒙特，于是由吉卜赛人认出了他的驴。果然如此，帕萨蒙特骑的就是他的驴。帕萨蒙特为了不被人认出来，也为了卖驴方便，已经换上了吉卜赛人的装束。他会讲吉卜赛语和其它许多语言，讲得跟自己的母语一样。可是桑乔一看见他就认出来了，立刻喊起来：\n “喂，臭贼希内西略！你放开它，那是我的东西，是我的宝贝，你别恬不知耻拿我的东西！你放开我的驴，我的心肝！躲开，你这婊子养的！躲远点儿，你这个贼！不是你的东西你别要！”\n 其实桑乔完全不必这么叫骂。他刚喊第一声，希内斯就放开驴，狂奔起来，一下子就无影无踪了。桑乔过去抱住他的驴，对它说道：\n “你怎么样啊，我的命根子，我的宝贝，我的伙伴？”\n 桑乔对驴又是亲吻又是抚摸，仿佛它是个活人。驴一声不吭，也不回答桑乔的话，任凭他亲吻抚摸。大家都过来祝贺桑乔找到了驴，特别是唐吉诃德，他还说他给桑乔的那张交付三头驴的票据仍然有效。桑乔对此表示感谢。\n 这边唐吉诃德和桑乔说着话，那边神甫称赞多罗特亚刚才的故事讲得很不错，既简短又符合骑士小说里的情节。多罗特亚说她常读骑士小说消遣，只不过不知道一些省份和海港在什么地方，因此才说是在奥苏纳下船的。\n “我知道就是由于这个原因，”神甫说，“所以赶紧过去说了刚才说的那些话，这样就没问题了。不过，这位落魄贵族因为这些胡编乱造的东西同骑士小说里描写的一样就轻易相信了，难道不奇怪吗？”\n “是很奇怪，”卡德尼奥说，“而且也少见。我简直想象不出，要编造这么多稀奇古怪的事情，得需要什么样的脑子才行。”\n “另外还有一件事，”神甫说，“这位善良的贵族除了他的荒谬疯话之外，说到其他事情时侃侃而谈，看样子头脑很清楚。所以，只要不提起骑士的事情，所有人都会认为他是个足智多谋的人。”\n 与此同时，唐吉诃德继续与桑乔说着他的事：\n “桑乔朋友，咱们消释前嫌吧，别再争吵了。你现在不要再计较什么恩怨，告诉我，你是何时何地以及如何找到杜尔西内亚的？她当时在干什么？你对她说了什么？她又是怎样回答的？她看信时脸色如何？谁帮你誊写了我的信？你当时看到的情况我都要知道，都该问，你也不必添枝加叶，为了哄我高兴就胡编，或者怕我不高兴就不说了。”\n “大人，”桑乔说，“如果说实话，那就是没有任何人帮我誊写信，因为我什么信也没带。”\n “这就对了，”唐吉诃德说，“因为你走了两天之后，我才发现记着我那封信的笔记簿还在我手里。我很伤心，不知道你发现没带信时怎么办。我觉得你发现没带信时肯定会回来。”\n “要是我没有把它记在脑子里，”桑乔说，“我就回来了。您把信念给我听以后，我把信的内容告诉了一个教堂司事，他帮我一字不漏地写了下来。那个司事还说，他见过许多封把人开除出教会的函件，可是像这封信写得一样好的函件却从没见过。”\n “那么，你现在还能记起来吗？”唐吉诃德问。\n “不，大人，”桑乔说，“我把信的内容告诉司事之后，觉得已经没什么用了，就把它忘了。如果我还能记得一点的话，那就是‘尊鬼的夫人’，噢，应该是‘尊贵的夫人’，最后就是‘至死忠贞的猥獕骑士’，中间加了三百多个‘我的灵魂、宝贝、心肝’等等。”\n \n
