{"id":42223,"no":83,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 29","content":"By stages as already described or left undescribed, two days after quitting the grove Don Quixote and Sancho reached the river Ebro, and the sight of it was a great delight to Don Quixote as he contemplated and gazed upon the charms of its banks, the clearness of its stream, the gentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters; and the pleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his mind. Above all, he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of Montesinos; for though Master Pedro’s ape had told him that of those things part was true, part false, he clung more to their truth than to their falsehood, the very reverse of Sancho, who held them all to be downright lies.\\n\\n As they were thus proceeding, then, they discovered a small boat, without oars or any other gear, that lay at the water’s edge tied to the stem of a tree growing on the bank. Don Quixote looked all round, and seeing nobody, at once, without more ado, dismounted from Rocinante and bade Sancho get down from Dapple and tie both beasts securely to the trunk of a poplar or willow that stood there. Sancho asked him the reason of this sudden dismounting and tying. Don Quixote made answer, “Thou must know, Sancho, that this bark is plainly, and without the possibility of any alternative, calling and inviting me to enter it, and in it go to give aid to some knight or other person of distinction in need of it, who is no doubt in some sore strait; for this is the way of the books of chivalry and of the enchanters who figure and speak in them. When a knight is involved in some difficulty from which he cannot be delivered save by the hand of another knight, though they may be at a distance of two or three thousand leagues or more one from the other, they either take him up on a cloud, or they provide a bark for him to get into, and in less than the twinkling of an eye they carry him where they will and where his help is required; and so, Sancho, this bark is placed here for the same purpose; this is as true as that it is now day, and ere this one passes tie Dapple and Rocinante together, and then in God’s hand be it to guide us; for I would not hold back from embarking, though barefooted friars were to beg me.”\\n\\n “As that’s the case,” said Sancho, “and your worship chooses to give in to these — I don’t know if I may call them absurdities — at every turn, there’s nothing for it but to obey and bow the head, bearing in mind the proverb, ‘Do as thy master bids thee, and sit down to table with him;’ but for all that, for the sake of easing my conscience, I warn your worship that it is my opinion this bark is no enchanted one, but belongs to some of the fishermen of the river, for they catch the best shad in the world here.”\\n\\n As Sancho said this, he tied the beasts, leaving them to the care and protection of the enchanters with sorrow enough in his heart. Don Quixote bade him not be uneasy about deserting the animals, “for he who would carry themselves over such longinquous roads and regions would take care to feed them.”\\n\\n “I don’t understand that logiquous,” said Sancho, “nor have I ever heard the word all the days of my life.”\\n\\n “Longinquous,” replied Don Quixote, “means far off; but it is no wonder thou dost not understand it, for thou art not bound to know Latin, like some who pretend to know it and don’t.”\\n\\n “Now they are tied,” said Sancho; “what are we to do next?”\\n\\n “What?” said Don Quixote, “cross ourselves and weigh anchor; I mean, embark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held;” and the bark began to drift away slowly from the bank. But when Sancho saw himself somewhere about two yards out in the river, he began to tremble and give himself up for lost; but nothing distressed him more than hearing Dapple bray and seeing Rocinante struggling to get loose, and said he to his master, “Dapple is braying in grief at our leaving him, and Rocinante is trying to escape and plunge in after us. O dear friends, peace be with you, and may this madness that is taking us away from you, turned into sober sense, bring us back to you.” And with this he fell weeping so bitterly, that Don Quixote said to him, sharply and angrily, “What art thou afraid of, cowardly creature? What art thou weeping at, heart of butter-paste? Who pursues or molests thee, thou soul of a tame mouse? What dost thou want, unsatisfied in the very heart of abundance? Art thou, perchance, tramping barefoot over the Riphaean mountains, instead of being seated on a bench like an archduke on the tranquil stream of this pleasant river, from which in a short space we shall come out upon the broad sea? But we must have already emerged and gone seven hundred or eight hundred leagues; and if I had here an astrolabe to take the altitude of the pole, I could tell thee how many we have travelled, though either I know little, or we have already crossed or shall shortly cross the equinoctial line which parts the two opposite poles midway.”\\n\\n “And when we come to that line your worship speaks of,” said Sancho, “how far shall we have gone?”\\n\\n “Very far,” said Don Quixote, “for of the three hundred and sixty degrees that this terraqueous globe contains, as computed by Ptolemy, the greatest cosmographer known, we shall have travelled one-half when we come to the line I spoke of.”\\n\\n “By God,” said Sancho, “your worship gives me a nice authority for what you say, putrid Dolly something transmogrified, or whatever it is.”\\n\\n Don Quixote laughed at the interpretation Sancho put upon “computed,” and the name of the cosmographer Ptolemy, and said he, “Thou must know, Sancho, that with the Spaniards and those who embark at Cadiz for the East Indies, one of the signs they have to show them when they have passed the equinoctial line I told thee of, is, that the lice die upon everybody on board the ship, and not a single one is left, or to be found in the whole vessel if they gave its weight in gold for it; so, Sancho, thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh, and if thou comest upon anything alive we shall be no longer in doubt; if not, then we have crossed.”\\n\\n “I don’t believe a bit of it,” said Sancho; “still, I’ll do as your worship bids me; though I don’t know what need there is for trying these experiments, for I can see with my own eyes that we have not moved five yards away from the bank, or shifted two yards from where the animals stand, for there are Rocinante and Dapple in the very same place where we left them; and watching a point, as I do now, I swear by all that’s good, we are not stirring or moving at the pace of an ant.”\\n\\n “Try the test I told thee of, Sancho,” said Don Quixote, “and don’t mind any other, for thou knowest nothing about colures, lines, parallels, zodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices, equinoxes, planets, signs, bearings, the measures of which the celestial and terrestrial spheres are composed; if thou wert acquainted with all these things, or any portion of them, thou wouldst see clearly how many parallels we have cut, what signs we have seen, and what constellations we have left behind and are now leaving behind. But again I tell thee, feel and hunt, for I am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white paper.”\\n\\n Sancho felt, and passing his hand gently and carefully down to the hollow of his left knee, he looked up at his master and said, “Either the test is a false one, or we have not come to where your worship says, nor within many leagues of it.”\\n\\n “Why, how so?” asked Don Quixote; “hast thou come upon aught?”\\n\\n “Ay, and aughts,” replied Sancho; and shaking his fingers he washed his whole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly gliding in midstream, not moved by any occult intelligence or invisible enchanter, but simply by the current, just there smooth and gentle.\\n\\n They now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the middle of the river, and the instant Don Quixote saw them he cried out, “Seest thou there, my friend? there stands the castle or fortress, where there is, no doubt, some knight in durance, or ill-used queen, or infanta, or princess, in whose aid I am brought hither.”\\n\\n “What the devil city, fortress, or castle is your worship talking about, senor?” said Sancho; “don’t you see that those are mills that stand in the river to grind corn?”\\n\\n “Hold thy peace, Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “though they look like mills they are not so; I have already told thee that enchantments transform things and change their proper shapes; I do not mean to say they really change them from one form into another, but that it seems as though they did, as experience proved in the transformation of Dulcinea, sole refuge of my hopes.”\\n\\n By this time, the boat, having reached the middle of the stream, began to move less slowly than hitherto. The millers belonging to the mills, when they saw the boat coming down the river, and on the point of being sucked in by the draught of the wheels, ran out in haste, several of them, with long poles to stop it, and being all mealy, with faces and garments covered with flour, they presented a sinister appearance. They raised loud shouts, crying, “Devils of men, where are you going to? Are you mad? Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces among these wheels?”\\n\\n “Did I not tell thee, Sancho,” said Don Quixote at this, “that we had reached the place where I am to show what the might of my arm can do? See what ruffians and villains come out against me; see what monsters oppose me; see what hideous countenances come to frighten us! You shall soon see, scoundrels!” And then standing up in the boat he began in a loud voice to hurl threats at the millers, exclaiming, “Ill-conditioned and worse-counselled rabble, restore to liberty and freedom the person ye hold in durance in this your fortress or prison, high or low or of whatever rank or quality he be, for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the Lions, for whom, by the disposition of heaven above, it is reserved to give a happy issue to this adventure;” and so saying he drew his sword and began making passes in the air at the millers, who, hearing but not understanding all this nonsense, strove to stop the boat, which was now getting into the rushing channel of the wheels. Sancho fell upon his knees devoutly appealing to heaven to deliver him from such imminent peril; which it did by the activity and quickness of the millers, who, pushing against the boat with their poles, stopped it, not, however, without upsetting and throwing Don Quixote and Sancho into the water; and lucky it was for Don Quixote that he could swim like a goose, though the weight of his armour carried him twice to the bottom; and had it not been for the millers, who plunged in and hoisted them both out, it would have been Troy town with the pair of them. As soon as, more drenched than thirsty, they were landed, Sancho went down on his knees and with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven, prayed a long and fervent prayer to God to deliver him evermore from the rash projects and attempts of his master. The fishermen, the owners of the boat, which the mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and seeing it smashed they proceeded to strip Sancho and to demand payment for it from Don Quixote; but he with great calmness, just as if nothing had happened him, told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for the bark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him, free and unhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that castle of theirs.\\n\\n \\n\\n “What persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman? Art thou for carrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills?”\\n\\n “That’s enough,” said Don Quixote to himself, “it would be preaching in the desert to attempt by entreaties to induce this rabble to do any virtuous action. In this adventure two mighty enchanters must have encountered one another, and one frustrates what the other attempts; one provided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God help us, this world is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes one with the other. I can do no more.” And then turning towards the mills he said aloud, “Friends, whoe’er ye be that are immured in that prison, forgive me that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver you from your misery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and destined for some other knight.”\\n\\n So saying he settled with the fishermen, and paid fifty reals for the boat, which Sancho handed to them very much against the grain, saying, “With a couple more bark businesses like this we shall have sunk our whole capital.”\\n\\n The fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the two figures, so very different to all appearance from ordinary men, and were wholly unable to make out the drift of the observations and questions Don Quixote addressed to them; and coming to the conclusion that they were madmen, they left them and betook themselves, the millers to their mills, and the fishermen to their huts. Don Quixote and Sancho returned to their beasts, and to their life of beasts, and so ended the adventure of the enchanted bark.\\n\\n \\n\\n 且说唐吉诃德和桑乔走出杨树林，来到了埃布罗河边。一看到河，唐吉诃德不禁心旷神怡。只见岸边一片秀丽景色，河流平缓，河水清清，如水晶一般源源不断，竟勾起了唐吉诃德的无限情思，特别是他在蒙特西诺斯洞里遇到的情景。虽然佩德罗师傅的猴子说过，那些事不过是真假参半，可唐吉诃德还是宁愿相信那些事都是真的。而桑乔却相反，他觉得那些事全是假的。\\n\\n 他们再往前走，眼前出现了一只小船。船拴在岸边的一棵树上，船上既没有桨，也没有渔具。唐吉诃德向四周看了看，不见一个人影。他没说什么，翻身下了马，让桑乔也下了驴，把马和驴都拴在旁边的一棵杨树或者柳树上。桑乔问唐吉诃德为什么要这样，唐吉诃德说：\\n\\n “你应该知道，桑乔，这条船肯定是在召唤我上去，乘着它去援救某个骑士或者其他有难而又急需帮助的贵人。这是骑士小说里魔法师常做的事情。某位骑士遇到了麻烦事，仅靠自己的力量已经不足以摆脱出来了，就必须求另外一位骑士帮助。虽然两个骑士相隔两三千里，或许更远，魔法师常常借助一块云，或者放上一条小船，让那个骑士上了小船，转眼之间，就从空中，或者海上，把骑士送到了需要他帮助的地方。所以我说，桑乔，这条小船肯定也是起这个作用的，这点可以确信无疑。不过在上船之前，你要先把马和驴拴在一起。我必须按照上帝的指引上船去，谁阻拦我也没有用。”\\n\\n “如果是这样，”桑乔说，“您又要弄出点儿我不知道是不是该称为胡说八道的东西了。不过我只好低头服从了，就像俗话说的，‘照主人的吩咐办，方能吃饱饭’。尽管如此，我还是于心不忍，想告诉您，我觉得这条船并不是遭受魔法的人的船，而是一条渔船。这条河里有世界上最好的鲱鱼。”\\n\\n 桑乔边说边把驴和马拴在一起。把两头牲口撇下，让它们听天由命，桑乔心疼得很。唐吉诃德让桑乔不用担心，说那个要把他们送到千里迢迢之外的人会喂好这些牲口的。\\n\\n “我不懂‘千里条条’是什么意思，”桑乔说，“我从来没有听说过这个词。”\\n\\n “‘千里迢迢’就是遥远的意思，”唐吉诃德说，“你不懂，这不新鲜，你又没学过拉丁文，而且不像某些人那样，自以为懂，其实一无所知。”\\n\\n “牲口已经拴好了，”桑乔说，“现在该怎么办了？”\\n\\n “该怎么办？”唐吉诃德说，“画个十字起锚啊。我是说，上船去，砍断缆绳。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德说着一跃就跳上了小船，桑乔也跟着跳了上去，并且砍断了缆绳，小船慢慢离开了河岸。小船离河岸将近两西里远的时候，桑乔开始哆嗦，唯恐船会沉到河里去。不过，最让他难过的还是听见他的驴在叫，看见罗西南多正在拼命企图挣脱缰绳。于是，他对唐吉诃德说：\\n\\n “驴离开了咱们，难过得直叫唤，罗西南多也想挣脱出来，以便跟随咱们。最尊贵的朋友们，你们安静下来吧。疯癫把我们分开了，但愿随之而来的如梦初醒还会让我们回到你们身边！”\\n\\n 说到这儿，桑乔竟痛心地哭起来。唐吉诃德又气又恼地说道：\\n\\n “你怕什么，胆小鬼？你哭什么，软骨头？谁打你了还是追你了，你这个耗子胆！难道你还缺什么吗？真是生在福中不知福。难道让你赤脚穿越里弗山①了？难道你不是像一位大公爵似的乘坐小船风平浪静地穿过这段迷人的河流，马上就要到达辽阔的大海了吗？咱们至少已经走出七八百里了。如果咱们这儿有仪器，可以量量北极的角度。那么我就可以告诉你，咱们已经走出多远了。虽然我懂得不多，我也可以说，咱们现在已经穿过或者很快就要穿过将南北极等距离平分的赤道线了。”\\n\\n ①摩洛哥地名。\\n\\n “等咱们到达您说的那条赤道时，”桑乔问，“咱们就走出多远了？”\\n\\n “已经很远了，”唐吉诃德说，“因为据已知最伟大的宇宙学家托勒密的计算，地球连水带陆地共有三百六十度。只要咱们到了我说的那条线，咱们就已经走了一半。”\\n\\n “上帝保佑，”桑乔说，“您引证的是一位多么高级的人物呀！什么指甲和蒜，还加上什么蜜之类的，我真搞不清楚。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德听到桑乔把宇宙学家、计算和托勒密等都搞错了，忍不住大笑。他对桑乔说道：\\n\\n “你大概听说过，桑乔，西班牙人或者从加的斯上船去东印度群岛的人，要想知道自己是否已经过了我刚才对你说的那条赤道线，其中一个方法就是看船上所有人身上的虱子是否都死光了。船只要一过赤道线，你就是拿金子换，全船也找不出一个活虱子了。所以桑乔，你可以伸手往自己腿上摸一摸。如果摸到了活东西，咱们就算把这件事搞清楚了。如果没摸到活东西，就是已经过了赤道线。”\\n\\n “我才不信呢，”桑乔说，“不过即使这样，我还是按您说的去做，尽管我不知道有什么必要做这种试验。凭我自己的眼睛看，咱们离开岸边并不远，而且离拴牲口的地方也很近，罗西南多和驴仍在原地。这么一看，我敢发誓，咱们走得像蚂蚁一样慢。”\\n\\n “你就照我说的去做，桑乔，别的不用管。你不懂什么叫二分二至圈、经线、纬线、黄道带、黄道、极地、至日、二分点、行星、天体符号、方位、等量呀等等，这些东西构成了天体和地球。如果你懂得这些东西，或者只懂一部分，你就可以知道咱们现在处于什么纬线，现在是什么黄道带，咱们已经经过了什么星座，下面还要经过什么星座。我再说一遍，你往自己身上摸摸，我估计你现在肯定比白纸还干净。”\\n\\n 桑乔用手去摸，逐渐摸到了左膝窝里。他抬起头，看着主人说道：\\n\\n “这个经验恐怕是假的，要不然就是离您说的那个地方还远着呢。”\\n\\n “怎么回事？”唐吉诃德问，“你摸到点什么？”\\n\\n “岂止是一点儿呢！”桑乔说。\\n\\n 桑乔甩甩手指头，又把整只手放进河里洗。小船随着河流平稳地向前漂移，没有任何神秘的魔力或者隐蔽的魔法师暗中推动，只有轻柔的河流缓缓流淌。\\n\\n 这时他们发现前面有几座高大的水磨房。唐吉诃德一看到水磨房就高声对桑乔说道：\\n\\n “你看到了吗，朋友？前面出现了一座城市、城堡或者要塞，那位受困的骑士或者落难的女王、公主或王妃，肯定就在那儿，我就是为了解救他们而被召唤到此的。”\\n\\n “您说什么见鬼的城市、城堡或要塞呀，大人？”桑乔说，“您没看清那只是磨小麦的水磨房吗？”\\n\\n “住嘴，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“即使它们像水磨房，也根本不是水磨房。我不是说过嘛，魔法可以使任何东西改变自己的本来面目。不是真把它们改变了，而是把它们变得看上去像某种东西，例如，我唯一的希望杜尔西内亚就被改变了模样。”\\n\\n 他们说话时，小船已经进入河的主流，不像刚才走的那样缓慢了。磨房里的工人看见一条小船顺流而来，眼看就要撞进水轮，急忙拿起长竿子出来拦挡小船。他们的脸上和衣服上都是面粉，所以样子显得挺怪的。他们高声喊着：\\n\\n “活见鬼！你们往哪儿去？不想活了？你们想干什么？你们是不是想掉进河里淹死。再被打成碎片呀？”\\n\\n “我不是说过嘛，桑乔，”唐吉诃德说，“咱们已经到了可以让我大显身手的地方！你看，妖魔鬼怪已经出来了。跟咱们作对的妖怪可真不少，而且面目都那么丑恶……好吧，那就来吧，你们这群混蛋！”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德从船上站起来，对磨房工人厉声喝道：\\n\\n “你们这群不知好歹的恶棍，赶紧把关在你们的要塞或牢狱里的人放出来，不管他们的身份是高是低，不管他们是什么人，我是曼查的唐吉诃德，又叫狮子骑士。我受上天之命，专程来解除这场危难。”\\n\\n 说完他拔出剑向磨房工人们挥舞。磨房工人们听了唐吉诃德一通乱喊，并不明白他喊的是什么意思，只顾用长竿去拦小船。此时，小船眼看就要进入水轮下的急流了。\\n\\n 桑乔跪了下来，诚心诚意地恳求老天把他从这场近在眼前的危难中解救出来。多亏磨房工人们手疾眼快，用长竿拦住了他们的船。船虽然被拦住了，可还是翻了个底朝天，唐吉诃德和桑乔都掉进水里。算唐吉诃德走运，他会游泳，但是身上的盔甲太重，拖累他两次沉到了河底。若不是磨房工人们跳进河里，把他们俩捞上来，情况就糟了。两人上了岸，浑身上下都湿透了，这回他们可不渴了。桑乔跪在地上，双手合拢，两眼朝天，虔诚地祈求了半天，祈求上帝保佑他从此摆脱主人的胡思乱想与胆大妄为。\\n\\n 小船的主人是几位渔民，此时也到了，可是小船已经被水轮撞成了碎片。看到小船坏了，几位渔民开始动手剥桑乔的衣服，并且要唐吉诃德赔偿小船。唐吉诃德十分镇静和若无其事地对磨房工人和渔民说，只要他们放了关押在城堡里的那个人或那几个人，他可以高价赔偿小船。\\n\\n “什么人，什么城堡，”一个磨房工人说，“你有毛病呀？\\n\\n 你难道想把到这儿来磨小麦的人都带走吗？”\\n\\n “够了！”唐吉诃德自言自语道，“看来，要说服这些强盗做件好事只不过是对牛弹琴。这回准是有两个本领高强的魔法师在较劲儿，一个想干，另一个就捣乱。一个让我上船，另一个就跟我对着干。上帝帮帮忙吧，这个世界到处都充满了尔虞我诈，我也没办法了。”\\n\\n 唐吉诃德提高了嗓门，看着水磨房说道：\\n\\n “被关在里面的朋友们，无论你们是什么人，都请你们原谅我。由于我和你们的不幸，我现在无法把你们从苦难中解救出来。这项任务只好留给其他骑士去完成了。”\\n\\n 然后，唐吉诃德同渔民们讲好，赔偿了五十雷阿尔的船钱。桑乔很不情愿地付了钱，然后说道：\\n\\n “再碰上两回这种乘船的事，咱们的钱就光了。”\\n\\n 渔民和磨房工人见他们两人与众不同，又听不懂唐吉诃德那些话的意思，感到十分惊奇，觉得他们像是疯子，便离开了他们。磨房工人进了水磨房，渔民回到自己的茅屋去了。唐吉诃德和桑乔也回到了他们拴牲口的地方。唐吉诃德和桑乔的魔船奇遇到此结束。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/79/4650.html","bookId":539,"book":{"id":539,"title":"Don Quixote堂吉诃德","description":"简介： Don Quixote , fully titled The Ingenious Hidalgo Don Quixote of La Mancha (Spanish: El ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la Mancha), is a novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes.
