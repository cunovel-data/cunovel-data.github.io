{"id":6432,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"Steerforth and I stayed for more than a fortnight in that part of the country. We were very much together, I need not say; but occasionally we were asunder for some hours at a time. He was a good sailor, and I was but an indifferent one; and when he went out boating with Mr. Peggotty, which was a favourite amusement of his, I generally remained ashore. My occupation of Peggotty\u0027s spare-room put a constraint upon me, from which he was free: for, knowing how assiduously she attended on Mr. Barkis all day, I did not like to remain out late at night; whereas Steerforth, lying at the Inn, had nothing to consult but his own humour. Thus it came about, that I heard of his making little treats for the fishermen at Mr. Peggotty\u0027s house of call, \u0027The Willing Mind\u0027, after I was in bed, and of his being afloat, wrapped in fishermen\u0027s clothes, whole moonlight nights, and coming back when the morning tide was at flood. By this time, however, I knew that his restless nature and bold spirits delighted to find a vent in rough toil and hard weather, as in any other means of excitement that presented itself freshly to him; so none of his proceedings surprised me. \\n\\n Another cause of our being sometimes apart, was, that I had naturally an interest in going over to Blunderstone, and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood; while Steerforth, after being there once, had naturally no great interest in going there again. Hence, on three or four days that I can at once recall, we went our several ways after an early breakfast, and met again at a late dinner. I had no idea how he employed his time in the interval, beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place, and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one. \\n\\n For my own part, my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to recall every yard of the old road as I went along it, and to haunt the old spots, of which I never tired. I haunted them, as my memory had often done, and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when I was far away. The grave beneath the tree, where both my parents lay - on which I had looked out, when it was my father\u0027s only, with such curious feelings of compassion, and by which I had stood, so desolate, when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby - the grave which Peggotty\u0027s own faithful care had ever since kept neat, and made a garden of, I walked near, by the hour. It lay a little off the churchyard path, in a quiet corner, not so far removed but I could read the names upon the stone as I walked to and fro, startled by the sound of the church-bell when it struck the hour, for it was like a departed voice to me. My reflections at these times were always associated with the figure I was to make in life, and the distinguished things I was to do. My echoing footsteps went to no other tune, but were as constant to that as if I had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother\u0027s side. \\n\\n There were great changes in my old home. The ragged nests, so long deserted by the rooks, were gone; and the trees were lopped and topped out of their remembered shapes. The garden had run wild, and half the windows of the house were shut up. It was occupied, but only by a poor lunatic gentleman, and the people who took care of him. He was always sitting at my little window, looking out into the churchyard; and I wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies that used to occupy mine, on the rosy mornings when I peeped out of that same little window in my night-clothes, and saw the sheep quietly feeding in the light of the rising sun. \\n\\n Our old neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Grayper, were gone to South America, and the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house, and stained the outer walls. Mr. Chillip was married again to a tall, raw-boned, high-nosed wife; and they had a weazen little baby, with a heavy head that it couldn\u0027t hold up, and two weak staring eyes, with which it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born. \\n\\n It was with a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure that I used to linger about my native place, until the reddening winter sun admonished me that it was time to start on my returning walk. But, when the place was left behind, and especially when Steerforth and I were happily seated over our dinner by a blazing fire, it was delicious to think of having been there. So it was, though in a softened degree, when I went to my neat room at night; and, turning over the leaves of the crocodile-book (which was always there, upon a little table), remembered with a grateful heart how blest I was in having such a friend as Steerforth, such a friend as Peggotty, and such a substitute for what I had lost as my excellent and generous aunt. \\n\\n MY nearest way to Yarmouth, in coming back from these long walks, was by a ferry. It landed me on the flat between the town and the sea, which I could make straight across, and so save myself a considerable circuit by the high road. Mr. Peggotty\u0027s house being on that waste-place, and not a hundred yards out of my track, I always looked in as I went by. Steerforth was pretty sure to be there expecting me, and we went on together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town. \\n\\n One dark evening, when I was later than usual - for I had, that day, been making my parting visit to Blunderstone, as we were now about to return home - I found him alone in Mr. Peggotty\u0027s house, sitting thoughtfully before the fire. He was so intent upon his own reflections that he was quite unconscious of my approach. This, indeed, he might easily have been if he had been less absorbed, for footsteps fell noiselessly on the sandy ground outside; but even my entrance failed to rouse him. I was standing close to him, looking at him; and still, with a heavy brow, he was lost in his meditations. \\n\\n He gave such a start when I put my hand upon his shoulder, that he made me start too. \\n\\n \u0027You come upon me,\u0027 he said, almost angrily, \u0027like a reproachful ghost!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I was obliged to announce myself, somehow,\u0027 I replied. \u0027Have I called you down from the stars?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he answered. \u0027No.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Up from anywhere, then?\u0027 said I, taking my seat near him. \\n\\n \u0027I was looking at the pictures in the fire,\u0027 he returned. \\n\\n \u0027But you are spoiling them for me,\u0027 said I, as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood, striking out of it a train of red-hot sparks that went careering up the little chimney, and roaring out into the air. \\n\\n \u0027You would not have seen them,\u0027 he returned. \u0027I detest this mongrel time, neither day nor night. How late you are! Where have you been?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I have been taking leave of my usual walk,\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027And I have been sitting here,\u0027 said Steerforth, glancing round the room, \u0027thinking that all the people we found so glad on the night of our coming down, might - to judge from the present wasted air of the place - be dispersed, or dead, or come to I don\u0027t know what harm. David, I wish to God I had had a judicious father these last twenty years!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027My dear Steerforth, what is the matter?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I wish with all my soul I had been better guided!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027I wish with all my soul I could guide myself better!\u0027 \\n\\n There was a passionate dejection in his manner that quite amazed me. He was more unlike himself than I could have supposed possible. \\n\\n \u0027It would be better to be this poor Peggotty, or his lout of a nephew,\u0027 he said, getting up and leaning moodily against the chimney-piece, with his face towards the fire, \u0027than to be myself, twenty times richer and twenty times wiser, and be the torment to myself that I have been, in this Devil\u0027s bark of a boat, within the last half-hour!\u0027 \\n\\n I was so confounded by the alteration in him, that at first I could only observe him in silence, as he stood leaning his head upon his hand, and looking gloomily down at the fire. At length I begged him, with all the earnestness I felt, to tell me what had occurred to cross him so unusually, and to let me sympathize with him, if I could not hope to advise him. Before I had well concluded, he began to laugh - fretfully at first, but soon with returning gaiety. \\n\\n \u0027Tut, it\u0027s nothing, Daisy! nothing!\u0027 he replied. \u0027I told you at the inn in London, I am heavy company for myself, sometimes. I have been a nightmare to myself, just now - must have had one, I think. At odd dull times, nursery tales come up into the memory, unrecognized for what they are. I believe I have been confounding myself with the bad boy who \"didn\u0027t care\", and became food for lions - a grander kind of going to the dogs, I suppose. What old women call the horrors, have been creeping over me from head to foot. I have been afraid of myself.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You are afraid of nothing else, I think,\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027Perhaps not, and yet may have enough to be afraid of too,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Well! So it goes by! I am not about to be hipped again, David; but I tell you, my good fellow, once more, that it would have been well for me (and for more than me) if I had had a steadfast and judicious father!\u0027 \\n\\n His face was always full of expression, but I never saw it express such a dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words, with his glance bent on the fire. \\n\\n \u0027So much for that!\u0027 he said, making as if he tossed something light into the air, with his hand. \"\u0027Why, being gone, I am a man again,\" like Macbeth. And now for dinner! If I have not (Macbeth-like) broken up the feast with most admired disorder, Daisy.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027But where are they all, I wonder!\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027God knows,\u0027 said Steerforth. \u0027After strolling to the ferry looking for you, I strolled in here and found the place deserted. That set me thinking, and you found me thinking.\u0027 \\n\\n The advent of Mrs. Gummidge with a basket, explained how the house had happened to be empty. She had hurried out to buy something that was needed, against Mr. Peggotty\u0027s return with the tide; and had left the door open in the meanwhile, lest Ham and little Em\u0027ly, with whom it was an early night, should come home while she was gone. Steerforth, after very much improving Mrs. Gummidge\u0027s spirits by a cheerful salutation and a jocose embrace, took my arm, and hurried me away. \\n\\n He had improved his own spirits, no less than Mrs. Gummidge\u0027s, for they were again at their usual flow, and he was full of vivacious conversation as we went along. \\n\\n \u0027And so,\u0027 he said, gaily, \u0027we abandon this buccaneer life tomorrow, do we?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027So we agreed,\u0027 I returned. \u0027And our places by the coach are taken, you know.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Ay! there\u0027s no help for it, I suppose,\u0027 said Steerforth. \u0027I have almost forgotten that there is anything to do in the world but to go out tossing on the sea here. I wish there was not.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027As long as the novelty should last,\u0027 said I, laughing. \\n\\n \u0027Like enough,\u0027 he returned; \u0027though there\u0027s a sarcastic meaning in that observation for an amiable piece of innocence like my young friend. Well! I dare say I am a capricious fellow, David. I know I am; but while the iron is hot, I can strike it vigorously too. I could pass a reasonably good examination already, as a pilot in these waters, I think.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Peggotty says you are a wonder,\u0027 I returned. \\n\\n \u0027A nautical phenomenon, eh?\u0027 laughed Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027Indeed he does, and you know how truly; I know how ardent you are in any pursuit you follow, and how easily you can master it. And that amazes me most in you, Steerforth- that you should be contented with such fitful uses of your powers.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Contented?\u0027 he answered, merrily. \u0027I am never contented, except with your freshness, my gentle Daisy. As to fitfulness, I have never learnt the art of binding myself to any of the wheels on which the Ixions of these days are turning round and round. I missed it somehow in a bad apprenticeship, and now don\u0027t care about it. - You know I have bought a boat down here?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What an extraordinary fellow you are, Steerforth!\u0027 I exclaimed, stopping - for this was the first I had heard of it. \u0027When you may never care to come near the place again!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know that,\u0027 he returned. \u0027I have taken a fancy to the place. At all events,\u0027 walking me briskly on, \u0027I have bought a boat that was for sale - a clipper, Mr. Peggotty says; and so she is - and Mr. Peggotty will be master of her in my absence.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Now I understand you, Steerforth!\u0027 said I, exultingly. \u0027You pretend to have bought it for yourself, but you have really done so to confer a benefit on him. I might have known as much at first, knowing you. My dear kind Steerforth, how can I tell you what I think of your generosity?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Tush!\u0027 he answered, turning red. \u0027The less said, the better.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Didn\u0027t I know?\u0027 cried I, \u0027didn\u0027t I say that there was not a joy, or sorrow, or any emotion of such honest hearts that was indifferent to you?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Aye, aye,\u0027 he answered, \u0027you told me all that. There let it rest. We have said enough!\u0027 \\n\\n Afraid of offending him by pursuing the subject when he made so light of it, I only pursued it in my thoughts as we went on at even a quicker pace than before. \\n\\n \u0027She must be newly rigged,\u0027 said Steerforth, \u0027and I shall leave Littimer behind to see it done, that I may know she is quite complete. Did I tell you Littimer had come down?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027 No.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh yes! came down this morning, with a letter from my mother.\u0027 \\n\\n As our looks met, I observed that he was pale even to his lips, though he looked very steadily at me. I feared that some difference between him and his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which I had found him at the solitary fireside. I hinted so. \\n\\n \u0027Oh no!\u0027 he said, shaking his head, and giving a slight laugh. \u0027Nothing of the sort! Yes. He is come down, that man of mine.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027The same as ever?\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027The same as ever,\u0027 said Steerforth. \u0027Distant and quiet as the North Pole. He shall see to the boat being fresh named. She\u0027s the \"Stormy Petrel\" now. What does Mr. Peggotty care for Stormy Petrels! I\u0027ll have her christened again.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027By what name?\u0027 I asked. \\n\\n \u0027The \"Little Em\u0027ly\".\u0027 \\n\\n As he had continued to look steadily at me, I took it as a reminder that he objected to being extolled for his consideration. I could not help showing in my face how much it pleased me, but I said little, and he resumed his usual smile, and seemed relieved. \\n\\n \u0027But see here,\u0027 he said, looking before us, \u0027where the original little Em\u0027ly comes! And that fellow with her, eh? Upon my soul, he\u0027s a true knight. He never leaves her!\u0027 \\n\\n Ham was a boat-builder in these days, having improved a natural ingenuity in that handicraft, until he had become a skilled workman. He was in his working-dress, and looked rugged enough, but manly withal, and a very fit protector for the blooming little creature at his side. Indeed, there was a frankness in his face, an honesty, and an undisguised show of his pride in her, and his love for her, which were, to me, the best of good looks. I thought, as they came towards us, that they were well matched even in that particular. \\n\\n She withdrew her hand timidly from his arm as we stopped to speak to them, and blushed as she gave it to Steerforth and to me. When they passed on, after we had exchanged a few words, she did not like to replace that hand, but, still appearing timid and constrained, walked by herself. I thought all this very pretty and engaging, and Steerforth seemed to think so too, as we looked after them fading away in the light of a young moon. \\n\\n Suddenly there passed us - evidently following them - a young woman whose approach we had not observed, but whose face I saw as she went by, and thought I had a faint remembrance of. She was lightly dressed; looked bold, and haggard, and flaunting, and poor; but seemed, for the time, to have given all that to the wind which was blowing, and to have nothing in her mind but going after them. As the dark distant level, absorbing their figures into itself, left but itself visible between us and the sea and clouds, her figure disappeared in like manner, still no nearer to them than before. \\n\\n \u0027That is a black shadow to be following the girl,\u0027 said Steerforth, standing still; \u0027what does it mean?\u0027 \\n\\n He spoke in a low voice that sounded almost strange to Me. \\n\\n \u0027She must have it in her mind to beg of them, I think,\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027A beggar would be no novelty,\u0027 said Steerforth; \u0027but it is a strange thing that the beggar should take that shape tonight.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 I asked. \\n\\n \u0027For no better reason, truly, than because I was thinking,\u0027 he said, after a pause, \u0027of something like it, when it came by. Where the Devil did it come from, I wonder!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027From the shadow of this wall, I think,\u0027 said I, as we emerged upon a road on which a wall abutted. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s gone!\u0027 he returned, looking over his shoulder. \u0027And all ill go with it. Now for our dinner!\u0027 \\n\\n But he looked again over his shoulder towards the sea-line glimmering afar off, and yet again. And he wondered about it, in some broken expressions, several times, in the short remainder of our walk; and only seemed to forget it when the light of fire and candle shone upon us, seated warm and merry, at table. \\n\\n Littimer was there, and had his usual effect upon me. When I said to him that I hoped Mrs. Steerforth and Miss Dartle were well, he answered respectfully (and of course respectably), that they were tolerably well, he thanked me, and had sent their compliments. This was all, and yet he seemed to me to say as plainly as a man could say: \u0027You are very young, sir; you are exceedingly young.\u0027 \\n\\n We had almost finished dinner, when taking a step or two towards the table, from the corner where he kept watch upon us, or rather upon me, as I felt, he said to his master: \\n\\n \u0027I beg your pardon, sir. Miss Mowcher is down here.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Who?\u0027 cried Steerforth, much astonished. \\n\\n \u0027Miss Mowcher, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why, what on earth does she do here?\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027It appears to be her native part of the country, sir. She informs me that she makes one of her professional visits here, every year, sir. I met her in the street this afternoon, and she wished to know if she might have the honour of waiting on you after dinner, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Do you know the Giantess in question, Daisy?\u0027 inquired Steerforth. \\n\\n I was obliged to confess - I felt ashamed, even of being at this disadvantage before Littimer - that Miss Mowcher and I were wholly unacquainted. \\n\\n \u0027Then you shall know her,\u0027 said Steerforth, \u0027for she is one of the seven wonders of the world. When Miss Mowcher comes, show her in.\u0027 \\n\\n I felt some curiosity and excitement about this lady, especially as Steerforth burst into a fit of laughing when I referred to her, and positively refused to answer any question of which I made her the subject. I remained, therefore, in a state of considerable expectation until the cloth had been removed some half an hour, and we were sitting over our decanter of wine before the fire, when the door opened, and Littimer, with his habitual serenity quite undisturbed, announced: \\n\\n \u0027Miss Mowcher!\u0027 \\n\\n I looked at the doorway and saw nothing. I was still looking at the doorway, thinking that Miss Mowcher was a long while making her appearance, when, to my infinite astonishment, there came waddling round a sofa which stood between me and it, a pursy dwarf, of about forty or forty-five, with a very large head and face, a pair of roguish grey eyes, and such extremely little arms, that, to enable herself to lay a finger archly against her snub nose, as she ogled Steerforth, she was obliged to meet the finger half-way, and lay her nose against it. Her chin, which was what is called a double chin, was so fat that it entirely swallowed up the strings of her bonnet, bow and all. Throat she had none; waist she had none; legs she had none, worth mentioning; for though she was more than full-sized down to where her waist would have been, if she had had any, and though she terminated, as human beings generally do, in a pair of feet, she was so short that she stood at a common-sized chair as at a table, resting a bag she carried on the seat. This lady - dressed in an off-hand, easy style; bringing her nose and her forefinger together, with the difficulty I have described; standing with her head necessarily on one side, and, with one of her sharp eyes shut up, making an uncommonly knowing face - after ogling Steerforth for a few moments, broke into a torrent of words. \\n\\n \u0027What! My flower!\u0027 she pleasantly began, shaking her large head at him. \u0027You\u0027re there, are you! Oh, you naughty boy, fie for shame, what do you do so far away from home? Up to mischief, I\u0027ll be bound. Oh, you\u0027re a downy fellow, Steerforth, so you are, and I\u0027m another, ain\u0027t I? Ha, ha, ha! You\u0027d have betted a hundred pound to five, now, that you wouldn\u0027t have seen me here, wouldn\u0027t you? Bless you, man alive, I\u0027m everywhere. I\u0027m here and there, and where not, like the conjurer\u0027s half-crown in the lady\u0027s handkercher. Talking of handkerchers - and talking of ladies - what a comfort you are to your blessed mother, ain\u0027t you, my dear boy, over one of my shoulders, and I don\u0027t say which!\u0027 \\n\\n Miss Mowcher untied her bonnet, at this passage of her discourse, threw back the strings, and sat down, panting, on a footstool in front of the fire - making a kind of arbour of the dining table, which spread its mahogany shelter above her head. \\n\\n \u0027Oh my stars and what\u0027s-their-names!\u0027 she went on, clapping a hand on each of her little knees, and glancing shrewdly at me, \u0027I\u0027m of too full a habit, that\u0027s the fact, Steerforth. After a flight of stairs, it gives me as much trouble to draw every breath I want, as if it was a bucket of water. If you saw me looking out of an upper window, you\u0027d think I was a fine woman, wouldn\u0027t you?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I should think that, wherever I saw you,\u0027 replied Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027Go along, you dog, do!\u0027 cried the little creature, making a whisk at him with the handkerchief with which she was wiping her face, \u0027and don\u0027t be impudent! But I give you my word and honour I was at Lady Mithers\u0027s last week - THERE\u0027S a woman! How SHE wears! - and Mithers himself came into the room where I was waiting for her - THERE\u0027S a man! How HE wears! and his wig too, for he\u0027s had it these ten years - and he went on at that rate in the complimentary line, that I began to think I should be obliged to ring the bell. Ha! ha! ha! He\u0027s a pleasant wretch, but he wants principle.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What were you doing for Lady Mithers?\u0027 asked Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s tellings, my blessed infant,\u0027 she retorted, tapping her nose again, screwing up her face, and twinkling her eyes like an imp of supernatural intelligence. \u0027Never YOU mind! You\u0027d like to know whether I stop her hair from falling off, or dye it, or touch up her complexion, or improve her eyebrows, wouldn\u0027t you? And so you shall, my darling - when I tell you! Do you know what my great grandfather\u0027s name was?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027It was Walker, my sweet pet,\u0027 replied Miss Mowcher, \u0027and he came of a long line of Walkers, that I inherit all the Hookey estates from.\u0027 \\n\\n I never beheld anything approaching to Miss Mowcher\u0027s wink except Miss Mowcher\u0027s self-possession. She had a wonderful way too, when listening to what was said to her, or when waiting for an answer to what she had said herself, of pausing with her head cunningly on one side, and one eye turned up like a magpie\u0027s. Altogether I was lost in amazement, and sat staring at her, quite oblivious, I am afraid, of the laws of politeness. \\n\\n She had by this time drawn the chair to her side, and was busily engaged in producing from the bag (plunging in her short arm to the shoulder, at every dive) a number of small bottles, sponges, combs, brushes, bits of flannel, little pairs of curling-irons, and other instruments, which she tumbled in a heap upon the chair. From this employment she suddenly desisted, and said to Steerforth, much to my confusion: \\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s your friend?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Copperfield,\u0027 said Steerforth; \u0027he wants to know you.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well, then, he shall! I thought he looked as if he did!\u0027 returned Miss Mowcher, waddling up to me, bag in hand, and laughing on me as she came. \u0027Face like a peach!\u0027 standing on tiptoe to pinch my cheek as I sat. \u0027Quite tempting! I\u0027m very fond of peaches. Happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Copperfield, I\u0027m sure.\u0027 \\n\\n I said that I congratulated myself on having the honour to make hers, and that the happiness was mutual. \\n\\n \u0027Oh, my goodness, how polite we are!\u0027 exclaimed Miss Mowcher, making a preposterous attempt to cover her large face with her morsel of a hand. \u0027What a world of gammon and spinnage it is, though, ain\u0027t it!\u0027 \\n\\n This was addressed confidentially to both of us, as the morsel of a hand came away from the face, and buried itself, arm and all, in the bag again. \\n\\n \u0027What do you mean, Miss Mowcher?\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027Ha! ha! ha! What a refreshing set of humbugs we are, to be sure, ain\u0027t we, my sweet child?\u0027 replied that morsel of a woman, feeling in the bag with her head on one side and her eye in the air. \u0027Look here!\u0027 taking something out. \u0027Scraps of the Russian Prince\u0027s nails. Prince Alphabet turned topsy-turvy, I call him, for his name\u0027s got all the letters in it, higgledy-piggledy.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027The Russian Prince is a client of yours, is he?\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027I believe you, my pet,\u0027 replied Miss Mowcher. \u0027I keep his nails in order for him. Twice a week! Fingers and toes.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027He pays well, I hope?\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027Pays, as he speaks, my dear child - through the nose,\u0027 replied Miss Mowcher. \u0027None of your close shavers the Prince ain\u0027t. You\u0027d say so, if you saw his moustachios. Red by nature, black by art.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027By your art, of course,\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n Miss Mowcher winked assent. \u0027Forced to send for me. Couldn\u0027t help it. The climate affected his dye; it did very well in Russia, but it was no go here. You never saw such a rusty Prince in all your born days as he was. Like old iron!\u0027 \u0027Is that why you called him a humbug, just now?\u0027 inquired Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027Oh, you\u0027re a broth of a boy, ain\u0027t you?\u0027 returned Miss Mowcher, shaking her head violently. \u0027I said, what a set of humbugs we were in general, and I showed you the scraps of the Prince\u0027s nails to prove it. The Prince\u0027s nails do more for me in private families of the genteel sort, than all my talents put together. I always carry \u0027em about. They\u0027re the best introduction. If Miss Mowcher cuts the Prince\u0027s nails, she must be all right. I give \u0027em away to the young ladies. They put \u0027em in albums, I believe. Ha! ha! ha! Upon my life, \"the whole social system\" (as the men call it when they make speeches in Parliament) is a system of Prince\u0027s nails!\u0027 said this least of women, trying to fold her short arms, and nodding her large head. \\n\\n Steerforth laughed heartily, and I laughed too. Miss Mowcher continuing all the time to shake her head (which was very much on one side), and to look into the air with one eye, and to wink with the other. \\n\\n \u0027Well, well!\u0027 she said, smiting her small knees, and rising, \u0027this is not business. Come, Steerforth, let\u0027s explore the polar regions, and have it over.\u0027 \\n\\n She then selected two or three of the little instruments, and a little bottle, and asked (to my surprise) if the table would bear. On Steerforth\u0027s replying in the affirmative, she pushed a chair against it, and begging the assistance of my hand, mounted up, pretty nimbly, to the top, as if it were a stage. \\n\\n \u0027If either of you saw my ankles,\u0027 she said, when she was safely elevated, \u0027say so, and I\u0027ll go home and destroy myself!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I did not,\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027I did not,\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027Well then,\u0027 cried Miss Mowcher,\u0027 I\u0027ll consent to live. Now, ducky, ducky, ducky, come to Mrs. Bond and be killed.\u0027 \\n\\n This was an invocation to Steerforth to place himself under her hands; who, accordingly, sat himself down, with his back to the table, and his laughing face towards me, and submitted his head to her inspection, evidently for no other purpose than our entertainment. To see Miss Mowcher standing over him, looking at his rich profusion of brown hair through a large round magnifying glass, which she took out of her pocket, was a most amazing spectacle. \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a pretty fellow!\u0027 said Miss Mowcher, after a brief inspection. \u0027You\u0027d be as bald as a friar on the top of your head in twelve months, but for me. just half a minute, my young friend, and we\u0027ll give you a polishing that shall keep your curls on for the next ten years!\u0027 \\n\\n With this, she tilted some of the contents of the little bottle on to one of the little bits of flannel, and, again imparting some of the virtues of that preparation to one of the little brushes, began rubbing and scraping away with both on the crown of Steerforth\u0027s head in the busiest manner I ever witnessed, talking all the time. \\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s Charley Pyegrave, the duke\u0027s son,\u0027 she said. \u0027You know Charley?\u0027 peeping round into his face. \\n\\n \u0027A little,\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027What a man HE is! THERE\u0027S a whisker! As to Charley\u0027s legs, if they were only a pair (which they ain\u0027t), they\u0027d defy competition. Would you believe he tried to do without me - in the Life-Guards, too?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Mad!\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027It looks like it. However, mad or sane, he tried,\u0027 returned Miss Mowcher. \u0027What does he do, but, lo and behold you, he goes into a perfumer\u0027s shop, and wants to buy a bottle of the Madagascar Liquid.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Charley does?\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027Charley does. But they haven\u0027t got any of the Madagascar Liquid.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What is it? Something to drink?\u0027 asked Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027To drink?\u0027 returned Miss Mowcher, stopping to slap his cheek. \u0027To doctor his own moustachios with, you know. There was a woman in the shop - elderly female - quite a Griffin - who had never even heard of it by name. \"Begging pardon, sir,\" said the Griffin to Charley, \"it\u0027s not - not - not ROUGE, is it?\" \"Rouge,\" said Charley to the Griffin. \"What the unmentionable to ears polite, do you think I want with rouge?\" \"No offence, sir,\" said the Griffin; \"we have it asked for by so many names, I thought it might be.\" Now that, my child,\u0027 continued Miss Mowcher, rubbing all the time as busily as ever, \u0027is another instance of the refreshing humbug I was speaking of. I do something in that way myself - perhaps a good deal - perhaps a little - sharp\u0027s the word, my dear boy - never mind!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027In what way do you mean? In the rouge way?\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027Put this and that together, my tender pupil,\u0027 returned the wary Mowcher, touching her nose, \u0027work it by the rule of Secrets in all trades, and the product will give you the desired result. I say I do a little in that way myself. One Dowager, SHE calls it lip-salve. Another, SHE calls it gloves. Another, SHE calls it tucker-edging. Another, SHE calls it a fan. I call it whatever THEY call it. I supply it for \u0027em, but we keep up the trick so, to one another, and make believe with such a face, that they\u0027d as soon think of laying it on, before a whole drawing-room, as before me. And when I wait upon \u0027em, they\u0027ll say to me sometimes - WITH IT ON - thick, and no mistake - \"How am I looking, Mowcher? Am I pale?\" Ha! ha! ha! ha! Isn\u0027t THAT refreshing, my young friend!\u0027 \\n\\n I never did in my days behold anything like Mowcher as she stood upon the dining table, intensely enjoying this refreshment, rubbing busily at Steerforth\u0027s head, and winking at me over it. \\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 she said. \u0027Such things are not much in demand hereabouts. That sets me off again! I haven\u0027t seen a pretty woman since I\u0027ve been here, jemmy.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No?\u0027 said Steerforth. \\n\\n \u0027Not the ghost of one,\u0027 replied Miss Mowcher. \\n\\n \u0027We could show her the substance of one, I think?\u0027 said Steerforth, addressing his eyes to mine. \u0027Eh, Daisy?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes, indeed,\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027Aha?\u0027 cried the little creature, glancing sharply at my face, and then peeping round at Steerforth\u0027s. \u0027Umph?\u0027 \\n\\n The first exclamation sounded like a question put to both of us, and the second like a question put to Steerforth only. She seemed to have found no answer to either, but continued to rub, with her head on one side and her eye turned up, as if she were looking for an answer in the air and were confident of its appearing presently. \\n\\n \u0027A sister of yours, Mr. Copperfield?\u0027 she cried, after a pause, and still keeping the same look-out. \u0027Aye, aye?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Steerforth, before I could reply. \u0027Nothing of the sort. On the contrary, Mr. Copperfield used - or I am much mistaken - to have a great admiration for her.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why, hasn\u0027t he now?\u0027 returned Miss Mowcher. \u0027Is he fickle? Oh, for shame! Did he sip every flower, and change every hour, until Polly his passion requited? - Is her name Polly?\u0027 \\n\\n The Elfin suddenness with which she pounced upon me with this question, and a searching look, quite disconcerted me for a moment. \\n\\n \u0027No, Miss Mowcher,\u0027 I replied. \u0027Her name is Emily.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Aha?\u0027 she cried exactly as before. \u0027Umph? What a rattle I am! Mr. Copperfield, ain\u0027t I volatile?\u0027 \\n\\n Her tone and look implied something that was not agreeable to me in connexion with the subject. So I said, in a graver manner than any of us had yet assumed: \u0027She is as virtuous as she is pretty. She is engaged to be married to a most worthy and deserving man in her own station of life. I esteem her for her good sense, as much as I admire her for her good looks.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well said!\u0027 cried Steerforth. \u0027Hear, hear, hear! Now I\u0027ll quench the curiosity of this little Fatima, my dear Daisy, by leaving her nothing to guess at. She is at present apprenticed, Miss Mowcher, or articled, or whatever it may be, to Omer and Joram, Haberdashers, Milliners, and so forth, in this town. Do you observe? Omer and Joram. The promise of which my friend has spoken, is made and entered into with her cousin; Christian name, Ham; surname, Peggotty; occupation, boat-builder; also of this town. She lives with a relative; Christian name, unknown; surname, Peggotty; occupation, seafaring; also of this town. She is the prettiest and most engaging little fairy in the world. I admire her - as my friend does - exceedingly. If it were not that I might appear to disparage her Intended, which I know my friend would not like, I would add, that to me she seems to be throwing herself away; that I am sure she might do better; and that I swear she was born to be a lady.\u0027 \\n\\n Miss Mowcher listened to these words, which were very slowly and distinctly spoken, with her head on one side, and her eye in the air as if she were still looking for that answer. When he ceased she became brisk again in an instant, and rattled away with surprising volubility. \\n\\n \u0027Oh! And that\u0027s all about it, is it?\u0027 she exclaimed, trimming his whiskers with a little restless pair of scissors, that went glancing round his head in all directions. \u0027Very well: very well! Quite a long story. Ought to end \"and they lived happy ever afterwards\"; oughtn\u0027t it? Ah! What\u0027s that game at forfeits? I love my love with an E, because she\u0027s enticing; I hate her with an E, because she\u0027s engaged. I took her to the sign of the exquisite, and treated her with an elopement, her name\u0027s Emily, and she lives in the east? Ha! ha! ha! Mr. Copperfield, ain\u0027t I volatile?\u0027 \\n\\n Merely looking at me with extravagant slyness, and not waiting for any reply, she continued, without drawing breath: \\n\\n \u0027There! If ever any scapegrace was trimmed and touched up to perfection, you are, Steerforth. If I understand any noddle in the world, I understand yours. Do you hear me when I tell you that, my darling? I understand yours,\u0027 peeping down into his face. \u0027Now you may mizzle, jemmy (as we say at Court), and if Mr. Copperfield will take the chair I\u0027ll operate on him.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What do you say, Daisy?\u0027 inquired Steerforth, laughing, and resigning his seat. \u0027Will you be improved?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Thank you, Miss Mowcher, not this evening.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t say no,\u0027 returned the little woman, looking at me with the aspect of a connoisseur; \u0027a little bit more eyebrow?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 I returned, \u0027some other time.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Have it carried half a quarter of an inch towards the temple,\u0027 said Miss Mowcher. \u0027We can do it in a fortnight.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No, I thank you. Not at present.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Go in for a tip,\u0027 she urged. \u0027No? Let\u0027s get the scaffolding up, then, for a pair of whiskers. Come!\u0027 \\n\\n I could not help blushing as I declined, for I felt we were on my weak point, now. But Miss Mowcher, finding that I was not at present disposed for any decoration within the range of her art, and that I was, for the time being, proof against the blandishments of the small bottle which she held up before one eye to enforce her persuasions, said we would make a beginning on an early day, and requested the aid of my hand to descend from her elevated station. Thus assisted, she skipped down with much agility, and began to tie her double chin into her bonnet. \\n\\n \u0027The fee,\u0027 said Steerforth, \u0027is -\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Five bob,\u0027 replied Miss Mowcher, \u0027and dirt cheap, my chicken. Ain\u0027t I volatile, Mr. Copperfield?\u0027 \\n\\n I replied politely: \u0027Not at all.\u0027 But I thought she was rather so, when she tossed up his two half-crowns like a goblin pieman, caught them, dropped them in her pocket, and gave it a loud slap. \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s the Till!\u0027 observed Miss Mowcher, standing at the chair again, and replacing in the bag a miscellaneous collection of little objects she had emptied out of it. \u0027Have I got all my traps? It seems so. It won\u0027t do to be like long Ned Beadwood, when they took him to church \"to marry him to somebody\", as he says, and left the bride behind. Ha! ha! ha! A wicked rascal, Ned, but droll! Now, I know I\u0027m going to break your hearts, but I am forced to leave you. You must call up all your fortitude, and try to bear it. Good-bye, Mr. Copperfield! Take care of yourself, jockey of Norfolk! How I have been rattling on! It\u0027s all the fault of you two wretches. I forgive you! \"Bob swore!\" - as the Englishman said for \"Good night\", when he first learnt French, and thought it so like English. \"Bob swore,\" my ducks!\u0027 \\n\\n With the bag slung over her arm, and rattling as she waddled away, she waddled to the door, where she stopped to inquire if she should leave us a lock of her hair. \u0027Ain\u0027t I volatile?\u0027 she added, as a commentary on this offer, and, with her finger on her nose, departed. \\n\\n Steerforth laughed to that degree, that it was impossible for me to help laughing too; though I am not sure I should have done so, but for this inducement. When we had had our laugh quite out, which was after some time, he told me that Miss Mowcher had quite an extensive connexion, and made herself useful to a variety of people in a variety of ways. Some people trifled with her as a mere oddity, he said; but she was as shrewdly and sharply observant as anyone he knew, and as long-headed as she was short-armed. He told me that what she had said of being here, and there, and everywhere, was true enough; for she made little darts into the provinces, and seemed to pick up customers everywhere, and to know everybody. I asked him what her disposition was: whether it was at all mischievous, and if her sympathies were generally on the right side of things: but, not succeeding in attracting his attention to these questions after two or three attempts, I forbore or forgot to repeat them. He told me instead, with much rapidity, a good deal about her skill, and her profits; and about her being a scientific cupper, if I should ever have occasion for her service in that capacity. \\n\\n She was the principal theme of our conversation during the evening: and when we parted for the night Steerforth called after me over the banisters, \u0027Bob swore!\u0027 as I went downstairs. \\n\\n I was surprised, when I came to Mr. Barkis\u0027s house, to find Ham walking up and down in front of it, and still more surprised to learn from him that little Em\u0027ly was inside. I naturally inquired why he was not there too, instead of pacing the streets by himself? \\n\\n \u0027Why, you see, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 he rejoined, in a hesitating manner, \u0027Em\u0027ly, she\u0027s talking to some \u0027un in here.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I should have thought,\u0027 said I, smiling, \u0027that that was a reason for your being in here too, Ham.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well, Mas\u0027r Davy, in a general way, so \u0027t would be,\u0027 he returned; \u0027but look\u0027ee here, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 lowering his voice, and speaking very gravely. \u0027It\u0027s a young woman, sir - a young woman, that Em\u0027ly knowed once, and doen\u0027t ought to know no more.\u0027 \\n\\n When I heard these words, a light began to fall upon the figure I had seen following them, some hours ago. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a poor wurem, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 said Ham, \u0027as is trod under foot by all the town. Up street and down street. The mowld o\u0027 the churchyard don\u0027t hold any that the folk shrink away from, more.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Did I see her tonight, Ham, on the sand, after we met you?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Keeping us in sight?\u0027 said Ham. \u0027It\u0027s like you did, Mas\u0027r Davy. Not that I know\u0027d then, she was theer, sir, but along of her creeping soon arterwards under Em\u0027ly\u0027s little winder, when she see the light come, and whispering \"Em\u0027ly, Em\u0027ly, for Christ\u0027s sake, have a woman\u0027s heart towards me. I was once like you!\" Those was solemn words, Mas\u0027r Davy, fur to hear!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027They were indeed, Ham. What did Em\u0027ly do?\u0027 \u0027Says Em\u0027ly, \"Martha, is it you? Oh, Martha, can it be you?\" - for they had sat at work together, many a day, at Mr. Omer\u0027s.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I recollect her now!\u0027 cried I, recalling one of the two girls I had seen when I first went there. \u0027I recollect her quite well!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Martha Endell,\u0027 said Ham. \u0027Two or three year older than Em\u0027ly, but was at the school with her.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I never heard her name,\u0027 said I. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean to interrupt you.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027For the matter o\u0027 that, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 replied Ham, \u0027all\u0027s told a\u0027most in them words, \"Em\u0027ly, Em\u0027ly, for Christ\u0027s sake, have a woman\u0027s heart towards me. I was once like you!\" She wanted to speak to Em\u0027ly. Em\u0027ly couldn\u0027t speak to her theer, for her loving uncle was come home, and he wouldn\u0027t - no, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 said Ham, with great earnestness, \u0027he couldn\u0027t, kind-natur\u0027d, tender-hearted as he is, see them two together, side by side, for all the treasures that\u0027s wrecked in the sea.\u0027 \\n\\n I felt how true this was. I knew it, on the instant, quite as well as Ham. \\n\\n \u0027So Em\u0027ly writes in pencil on a bit of paper,\u0027 he pursued, \u0027and gives it to her out o\u0027 winder to bring here. \"Show that,\" she says, \"to my aunt, Mrs. Barkis, and she\u0027ll set you down by her fire, for the love of me, till uncle is gone out, and I can come.\" By and by she tells me what I tell you, Mas\u0027r Davy, and asks me to bring her. What can I do? She doen\u0027t ought to know any such, but I can\u0027t deny her, when the tears is on her face.\u0027 \\n\\n He put his hand into the breast of his shaggy jacket, and took out with great care a pretty little purse. \\n\\n \u0027And if I could deny her when the tears was on her face, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 said Ham, tenderly adjusting it on the rough palm of his hand, \u0027how could I deny her when she give me this to carry for her - knowing what she brought it for? Such a toy as it is!\u0027 said Ham, thoughtfully looking on it. \u0027With such a little money in it, Em\u0027ly my dear.\u0027 \\n\\n I shook him warmly by the hand when he had put it away again - for that was more satisfactory to me than saying anything - and we walked up and down, for a minute or two, in silence. The door opened then, and Peggotty appeared, beckoning to Ham to come in. I would have kept away, but she came after me, entreating me to come in too. Even then, I would have avoided the room where they all were, but for its being the neat-tiled kitchen I have mentioned more than once. The door opening immediately into it, I found myself among them before I considered whither I was going. \\n\\n The girl - the same I had seen upon the sands - was near the fire. She was sitting on the ground, with her head and one arm lying on a chair. I fancied, from the disposition of her figure, that Em\u0027ly had but newly risen from the chair, and that the forlorn head might perhaps have been lying on her lap. I saw but little of the girl\u0027s face, over which her hair fell loose and scattered, as if she had been disordering it with her own hands; but I saw that she was young, and of a fair complexion. Peggotty had been crying. So had little Em\u0027ly. Not a word was spoken when we first went in; and the Dutch clock by the dresser seemed, in the silence, to tick twice as loud as usual. Em\u0027ly spoke first. \\n\\n \u0027Martha wants,\u0027 she said to Ham, \u0027to go to London.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why to London?\u0027 returned Ham. \\n\\n He stood between them, looking on the prostrate girl with a mixture of compassion for her, and of jealousy of her holding any companionship with her whom he loved so well, which I have always remembered distinctly. They both spoke as if she were ill; in a soft, suppressed tone that was plainly heard, although it hardly rose above a whisper. \\n\\n \u0027Better there than here,\u0027 said a third voice aloud - Martha\u0027s, though she did not move. \u0027No one knows me there. Everybody knows me here.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What will she do there?\u0027 inquired Ham. \\n\\n She lifted up her head, and looked darkly round at him for a moment; then laid it down again, and curved her right arm about her neck, as a woman in a fever, or in an agony of pain from a shot, might twist herself. \\n\\n \u0027She will try to do well,\u0027 said little Em\u0027ly. \u0027You don\u0027t know what she has said to us. Does he - do they - aunt?\u0027 \\n\\n Peggotty shook her head compassionately. \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll try,\u0027 said Martha, \u0027if you\u0027ll help me away. I never can do worse than I have done here. I may do better. Oh!\u0027 with a dreadful shiver, \u0027take me out of these streets, where the whole town knows me from a child!\u0027 \\n\\n As Em\u0027ly held out her hand to Ham, I saw him put in it a little canvas bag. She took it, as if she thought it were her purse, and made a step or two forward; but finding her mistake, came back to where he had retired near me, and showed it to him. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all yourn, Em\u0027ly,\u0027 I could hear him say. \u0027I haven\u0027t nowt in all the wureld that ain\u0027t yourn, my dear. It ain\u0027t of no delight to me, except for you!\u0027 \\n\\n The tears rose freshly in her eyes, but she turned away and went to Martha. What she gave her, I don\u0027t know. I saw her stooping over her, and putting money in her bosom. She whispered something, as she asked was that enough? \u0027More than enough,\u0027 the other said, and took her hand and kissed it. \\n\\n Then Martha arose, and gathering her shawl about her, covering her face with it, and weeping aloud, went slowly to the door. She stopped a moment before going out, as if she would have uttered something or turned back; but no word passed her lips. Making the same low, dreary, wretched moaning in her shawl, she went away. \\n\\n As the door closed, little Em\u0027ly looked at us three in a hurried manner and then hid her face in her hands, and fell to sobbing. \\n\\n \u0027Doen\u0027t, Em\u0027ly!\u0027 said Ham, tapping her gently on the shoulder. \u0027Doen\u0027t, my dear! You doen\u0027t ought to cry so, pretty!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh, Ham!\u0027 she exclaimed, still weeping pitifully, \u0027I am not so good a girl as I ought to be! I know I have not the thankful heart, sometimes, I ought to have!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes, you have, I\u0027m sure,\u0027 said Ham. \\n\\n \u0027No! no! no!\u0027 cried little Em\u0027ly, sobbing, and shaking her head. \u0027I am not as good a girl as I ought to be. Not near! not near!\u0027 And still she cried, as if her heart would break. \\n\\n \u0027I try your love too much. I know I do!\u0027 she sobbed. \u0027I\u0027m often cross to you, and changeable with you, when I ought to be far different. You are never so to me. Why am I ever so to you, when I should think of nothing but how to be grateful, and to make you happy!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You always make me so,\u0027 said Ham, \u0027my dear! I am happy in the sight of you. I am happy, all day long, in the thoughts of you.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Ah! that\u0027s not enough!\u0027 she cried. \u0027That is because you are good; not because I am! Oh, my dear, it might have been a better fortune for you, if you had been fond of someone else - of someone steadier and much worthier than me, who was all bound up in you, and never vain and changeable like me!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Poor little tender-heart,\u0027 said Ham, in a low voice. \u0027Martha has overset her, altogether.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Please, aunt,\u0027 sobbed Em\u0027ly, \u0027come here, and let me lay my head upon you. Oh, I am very miserable tonight, aunt! Oh, I am not as good a girl as I ought to be. I am not, I know!\u0027 \\n\\n Peggotty had hastened to the chair before the fire. Em\u0027ly, with her arms around her neck, kneeled by her, looking up most earnestly into her face. \\n\\n \u0027Oh, pray, aunt, try to help me! Ham, dear, try to help me! Mr. David, for the sake of old times, do, please, try to help me! I want to be a better girl than I am. I want to feel a hundred times more thankful than I do. I want to feel more, what a blessed thing it is to be the wife of a good man, and to lead a peaceful life. Oh me, oh me! Oh my heart, my heart!\u0027 \\n\\n She dropped her face on my old nurse\u0027s breast, and, ceasing this supplication, which in its agony and grief was half a woman\u0027s, half a child\u0027s, as all her manner was (being, in that, more natural, and better suited to her beauty, as I thought, than any other manner could have been), wept silently, while my old nurse hushed her like an infant. \\n\\n She got calmer by degrees, and then we soothed her; now talking encouragingly, and now jesting a little with her, until she began to raise her head and speak to us. So we got on, until she was able to smile, and then to laugh, and then to sit up, half ashamed; while Peggotty recalled her stray ringlets, dried her eyes, and made her neat again, lest her uncle should wonder, when she got home, why his darling had been crying. \\n\\n I saw her do, that night, what I had never seen her do before. I saw her innocently kiss her chosen husband on the cheek, and creep close to his bluff form as if it were her best support. When they went away together, in the waning moonlight, and I looked after them, comparing their departure in my mind with Martha\u0027s, I saw that she held his arm with both her hands, and still kept close to him.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101/5349.html","bookId":208,"book":{"id":208,"title":"David Copperfield大卫·科波菲尔","description":"简介： David Copperfield or The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a novel in 185...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290216055bf31c.jpg","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM"}}
