{"id":6461,"no":51,"title":"Chapter 51","content":"It was yet early in the morning of the following day, when, as I was walking in my garden with my aunt (who took little other exercise now, being so much in attendance on my dear Dora), I was told that Mr. Peggotty desired to speak with me. He came into the garden to meet me half-way, on my going towards the gate; and bared his head, as it was always his custom to do when he saw my aunt, for whom he had a high respect. I had been telling her all that had happened overnight. Without saying a word, she walked up with a cordial face, shook hands with him, and patted him on the arm. It was so expressively done, that she had no need to say a word. Mr. Peggotty understood her quite as well as if she had said a thousand. \u0027I\u0027ll go in now, Trot,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027and look after Little Blossom, who will be getting up presently.\u0027 \u0027Not along of my being heer, ma\u0027am, I hope?\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty. \u0027Unless my wits is gone a bahd\u0027s neezing\u0027 - by which Mr. Peggotty meant to say, bird\u0027s-nesting - \u0027this morning, \u0027tis along of me as you\u0027re a-going to quit us?\u0027 \u0027You have something to say, my good friend,\u0027 returned my aunt, \u0027and will do better without me.\u0027 \u0027By your leave, ma\u0027am,\u0027 returned Mr. Peggotty, \u0027I should take it kind, pervising you doen\u0027t mind my clicketten, if you\u0027d bide heer.\u0027 \u0027Would you?\u0027 said my aunt, with short good-nature. \u0027Then I am sure I will!\u0027 So, she drew her arm through Mr. Peggotty\u0027s, and walked with him to a leafy little summer-house there was at the bottom of the garden, where she sat down on a bench, and I beside her. There was a seat for Mr. Peggotty too, but he preferred to stand, leaning his hand on the small rustic table. As he stood, looking at his cap for a little while before beginning to speak, I could not help observing what power and force of character his sinewy hand expressed, and what a good and trusty companion it was to his honest brow and iron-grey hair. \u0027I took my dear child away last night,\u0027 Mr. Peggotty began, as he raised his eyes to ours, \u0027to my lodging, wheer I have a long time been expecting of her and preparing fur her. It was hours afore she knowed me right; and when she did, she kneeled down at my feet, and kiender said to me, as if it was her prayers, how it all come to be. You may believe me, when I heerd her voice, as I had heerd at home so playful - and see her humbled, as it might be in the dust our Saviour wrote in with his blessed hand - I felt a wownd go to my \u0027art, in the midst of all its thankfulness.\u0027 He drew his sleeve across his face, without any pretence of concealing why; and then cleared his voice. \u0027It warn\u0027t for long as I felt that; for she was found. I had on\u0027y to think as she was found, and it was gone. I doen\u0027t know why I do so much as mention of it now, I\u0027m sure. I didn\u0027t have it in my mind a minute ago, to say a word about myself; but it come up so nat\u0027ral, that I yielded to it afore I was aweer.\u0027 \u0027You are a self-denying soul,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027and will have your reward.\u0027 Mr. Peggotty, with the shadows of the leaves playing athwart his face, made a surprised inclination of the head towards my aunt, as an acknowledgement of her good opinion; then took up the thread he had relinquished. \u0027When my Em\u0027ly took flight,\u0027 he said, in stern wrath for the moment, \u0027from the house wheer she was made a prisoner by that theer spotted snake as Mas\u0027r Davy see, - and his story\u0027s trew, and may GOD confound him! - she took flight in the night. It was a dark night, with a many stars a-shining. She was wild. She ran along the sea beach, believing the old boat was theer; and calling out to us to turn away our faces, for she was a-coming by. She heerd herself a-crying out, like as if it was another person; and cut herself on them sharp-pinted stones and rocks, and felt it no more than if she had been rock herself. Ever so fur she run, and there was fire afore her eyes, and roarings in her ears. Of a sudden - or so she thowt, you unnerstand - the day broke, wet and windy, and she was lying b\u0027low a heap of stone upon the shore, and a woman was a-speaking to her, saying, in the language of that country, what was it as had gone so much amiss?\u0027 He saw everything he related. It passed before him, as he spoke, so vividly, that, in the intensity of his earnestness, he presented what he described to me, with greater distinctness than I can express. I can hardly believe, writing now long afterwards, but that I was actually present in these scenes; they are impressed upon me with such an astonishing air of fidelity. \u0027As Em\u0027ly\u0027s eyes - which was heavy - see this woman better,\u0027 Mr. Peggotty went on, \u0027she know\u0027d as she was one of them as she had often talked to on the beach. Fur, though she had run (as I have said) ever so fur in the night, she had oftentimes wandered long ways, partly afoot, partly in boats and carriages, and know\u0027d all that country, \u0027long the coast, miles and miles. She hadn\u0027t no children of her own, this woman, being a young wife; but she was a- looking to have one afore long. And may my prayers go up to Heaven that \u0027twill be a happiness to her, and a comfort, and a honour, all her life! May it love her and be dootiful to her, in her old age; helpful of her at the last; a Angel to her heer, and heerafter!\u0027 \u0027Amen!\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027She had been summat timorous and down,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, and had sat, at first, a little way off, at her spinning, or such work as it was, when Em\u0027ly talked to the children. But Em\u0027ly had took notice of her, and had gone and spoke to her; and as the young woman was partial to the children herself, they had soon made friends. Sermuchser, that when Em\u0027ly went that way, she always giv Em\u0027ly flowers. This was her as now asked what it was that had gone so much amiss. Em\u0027ly told her, and she - took her home. She did indeed. She took her home,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, covering his face. He was more affected by this act of kindness, than I had ever seen him affected by anything since the night she went away. My aunt and I did not attempt to disturb him. \u0027It was a little cottage, you may suppose,\u0027 he said, presently, \u0027but she found space for Em\u0027ly in it, - her husband was away at sea, - and she kep it secret, and prevailed upon such neighbours as she had (they was not many near) to keep it secret too. Em\u0027ly was took bad with fever, and, what is very strange to me is, - maybe \u0027tis not so strange to scholars, - the language of that country went out of her head, and she could only speak her own, that no one unnerstood. She recollects, as if she had dreamed it, that she lay there always a-talking her own tongue, always believing as the old boat was round the next pint in the bay, and begging and imploring of \u0027em to send theer and tell how she was dying, and bring back a message of forgiveness, if it was on\u0027y a wured. A\u0027most the whole time, she thowt, - now, that him as I made mention on just now was lurking for her unnerneath the winder; now that him as had brought her to this was in the room, - and cried to the good young woman not to give her up, and know\u0027d, at the same time, that she couldn\u0027t unnerstand, and dreaded that she must be took away. Likewise the fire was afore her eyes, and the roarings in her ears; and theer was no today, nor yesterday, nor yet tomorrow; but everything in her life as ever had been, or as ever could be, and everything as never had been, and as never could be, was a crowding on her all at once, and nothing clear nor welcome, and yet she sang and laughed about it! How long this lasted, I doen\u0027t know; but then theer come a sleep; and in that sleep, from being a many times stronger than her own self, she fell into the weakness of the littlest child.\u0027 Here he stopped, as if for relief from the terrors of his own description. After being silent for a few moments, he pursued his story. \u0027It was a pleasant arternoon when she awoke; and so quiet, that there warn\u0027t a sound but the rippling of that blue sea without a tide, upon the shore. It was her belief, at first, that she was at home upon a Sunday morning; but the vine leaves as she see at the winder, and the hills beyond, warn\u0027t home, and contradicted of her. Then, come in her friend to watch alongside of her bed; and then she know\u0027d as the old boat warn\u0027t round that next pint in the bay no more, but was fur off; and know\u0027d where she was, and why; and broke out a-crying on that good young woman\u0027s bosom, wheer I hope her baby is a-lying now, a-cheering of her with its pretty eyes!\u0027 He could not speak of this good friend of Emily\u0027s without a flow of tears. It was in vain to try. He broke down again, endeavouring to bless her! \u0027That done my Em\u0027ly good,\u0027 he resumed, after such emotion as I could not behold without sharing in; and as to my aunt, she wept with all her heart; \u0027that done Em\u0027ly good, and she begun to mend. But, the language of that country was quite gone from her, and she was forced to make signs. So she went on, getting better from day to day, slow, but sure, and trying to learn the names of common things - names as she seemed never to have heerd in all her life - till one evening come, when she was a-setting at her window, looking at a little girl at play upon the beach. And of a sudden this child held out her hand, and said, what would be in English, \"Fisherman\u0027s daughter, here\u0027s a shell!\" - for you are to unnerstand that they used at first to call her \"Pretty lady\", as the general way in that country is, and that she had taught \u0027em to call her \"Fisherman\u0027s daughter\" instead. The child says of a sudden, \"Fisherman\u0027s daughter, here\u0027s a shell!\" Then Em\u0027ly unnerstands her; and she answers, bursting out a-crying; and it all comes back! \u0027When Em\u0027ly got strong again,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, after another short interval of silence, \u0027she cast about to leave that good young creetur, and get to her own country. The husband was come home, then; and the two together put her aboard a small trader bound to Leghorn, and from that to France. She had a little money, but it was less than little as they would take for all they done. I\u0027m a\u0027most glad on it, though they was so poor! What they done, is laid up wheer neither moth or rust doth corrupt, and wheer thieves do not break through nor steal. Mas\u0027r Davy, it\u0027ll outlast all the treasure in the wureld. \u0027Em\u0027ly got to France, and took service to wait on travelling ladies at a inn in the port. Theer, theer come, one day, that snake. - Let him never come nigh me. I doen\u0027t know what hurt I might do him! - Soon as she see him, without him seeing her, all her fear and wildness returned upon her, and she fled afore the very breath he draw\u0027d. She come to England, and was set ashore at Dover. \u0027I doen\u0027t know,\" said Mr. Peggotty, \u0027for sure, when her \u0027art begun to fail her; but all the way to England she had thowt to come to her dear home. Soon as she got to England she turned her face tow\u0027rds it. But, fear of not being forgiv, fear of being pinted at, fear of some of us being dead along of her, fear of many things, turned her from it, kiender by force, upon the road: \"Uncle, uncle,\" she says to me, \"the fear of not being worthy to do what my torn and bleeding breast so longed to do, was the most fright\u0027ning fear of all! I turned back, when my \u0027art was full of prayers that I might crawl to the old door-step, in the night, kiss it, lay my wicked face upon it, and theer be found dead in the morning.\" \u0027She come,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, dropping his voice to an awe-stricken whisper, \u0027to London. She - as had never seen it in her life - alone - without a penny - young - so pretty - come to London. A\u0027most the moment as she lighted heer, all so desolate, she found (as she believed) a friend; a decent woman as spoke to her about the needle-work as she had been brought up to do, about finding plenty of it fur her, about a lodging fur the night, and making secret inquiration concerning of me and all at home, tomorrow. When my child,\u0027 he said aloud, and with an energy of gratitude that shook him from head to foot, \u0027stood upon the brink of more than I can say or think on - Martha, trew to her promise, saved her.\u0027 I could not repress a cry of joy. \u0027Mas\u0027r Davy!\u0027 said he, gripping my hand in that strong hand of his, \u0027it was you as first made mention of her to me. I thankee, sir! She was arnest. She had know\u0027d of her bitter knowledge wheer to watch and what to do. She had done it. And the Lord was above all! She come, white and hurried, upon Em\u0027ly in her sleep. She says to her, \"Rise up from worse than death, and come with me!\" Them belonging to the house would have stopped her, but they might as soon have stopped the sea. \"Stand away from me,\" she says, \"I am a ghost that calls her from beside her open grave!\" She told Em\u0027ly she had seen me, and know\u0027d I loved her, and forgive her. She wrapped her, hasty, in her clothes. She took her, faint and trembling, on her arm. She heeded no more what they said, than if she had had no ears. She walked among \u0027em with my child, minding only her; and brought her safe out, in the dead of the night, from that black pit of ruin! \u0027She attended on Em\u0027ly,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, who had released my hand, and put his own hand on his heaving chest; \u0027she attended to my Em\u0027ly, lying wearied out, and wandering betwixt whiles, till late next day. Then she went in search of me; then in search of you, Mas\u0027r Davy. She didn\u0027t tell Em\u0027ly what she come out fur, lest her \u0027art should fail, and she should think of hiding of herself. How the cruel lady know\u0027d of her being theer, I can\u0027t say. Whether him as I have spoke so much of, chanced to see \u0027em going theer, or whether (which is most like, to my thinking) he had heerd it from the woman, I doen\u0027t greatly ask myself. My niece is found. \u0027All night long,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, \u0027we have been together, Em\u0027ly and me. \u0027Tis little (considering the time) as she has said, in wureds, through them broken-hearted tears; \u0027tis less as I have seen of her dear face, as grow\u0027d into a woman\u0027s at my hearth. But, all night long, her arms has been about my neck; and her head has laid heer; and we knows full well, as we can put our trust in one another, ever more.\u0027 He ceased to speak, and his hand upon the table rested there in perfect repose, with a resolution in it that might have conquered lions. \u0027It was a gleam of light upon me, Trot,\u0027 said my aunt, drying her eyes, \u0027when I formed the resolution of being godmother to your sister Betsey Trotwood, who disappointed me; but, next to that, hardly anything would have given me greater pleasure, than to be godmother to that good young creature\u0027s baby!\u0027 Mr. Peggotty nodded his understanding of my aunt\u0027s feelings, but could not trust himself with any verbal reference to the subject of her commendation. We all remained silent, and occupied with our own reflections (my aunt drying her eyes, and now sobbing convulsively, and now laughing and calling herself a fool); until I spoke. \u0027You have quite made up your mind,\u0027 said I to Mr. Peggotty, \u0027as to the future, good friend? I need scarcely ask you.\u0027 \u0027Quite, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 he returned; \u0027and told Em\u0027ly. Theer\u0027s mighty countries, fur from heer. Our future life lays over the sea.\u0027 \u0027They will emigrate together, aunt,\u0027 said I. \u0027Yes!\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, with a hopeful smile. \u0027No one can\u0027t reproach my darling in Australia. We will begin a new life over theer!\u0027 I asked him if he yet proposed to himself any time for going away. \u0027I was down at the Docks early this morning, sir,\u0027 he returned, \u0027to get information concerning of them ships. In about six weeks or two months from now, there\u0027ll be one sailing - I see her this morning - went aboard - and we shall take our passage in her.\u0027 \u0027Quite alone?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Aye, Mas\u0027r Davy!\u0027 he returned. \u0027My sister, you see, she\u0027s that fond of you and yourn, and that accustomed to think on\u0027y of her own country, that it wouldn\u0027t be hardly fair to let her go. Besides which, theer\u0027s one she has in charge, Mas\u0027r Davy, as doen\u0027t ought to be forgot.\u0027 \u0027Poor Ham!\u0027 said I. \u0027My good sister takes care of his house, you see, ma\u0027am, and he takes kindly to her,\u0027 Mr. Peggotty explained for my aunt\u0027s better information. \u0027He\u0027ll set and talk to her, with a calm spirit, wen it\u0027s like he couldn\u0027t bring himself to open his lips to another. Poor fellow!\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, shaking his head, \u0027theer\u0027s not so much left him, that he could spare the little as he has!\u0027 \u0027And Mrs. Gummidge?\u0027 said I. \u0027Well, I\u0027ve had a mort of consideration, I do tell you,\u0027 returned Mr. Peggotty, with a perplexed look which gradually cleared as he went on, \u0027concerning of Missis Gummidge. You see, wen Missis Gummidge falls a-thinking of the old \u0027un, she an\u0027t what you may call good company. Betwixt you and me, Mas\u0027r Davy - and you, ma\u0027am - wen Mrs. Gummidge takes to wimicking,\u0027 - our old country word for crying, - \u0027she\u0027s liable to be considered to be, by them as didn\u0027t know the old \u0027un, peevish-like. Now I DID know the old \u0027un,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, \u0027and I know\u0027d his merits, so I unnerstan\u0027 her; but \u0027tan\u0027t entirely so, you see, with others - nat\u0027rally can\u0027t be!\u0027 My aunt and I both acquiesced. \u0027Wheerby,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, \u0027my sister might - I doen\u0027t say she would, but might - find Missis Gummidge give her a leetle trouble now-and-again. Theerfur \u0027tan\u0027t my intentions to moor Missis Gummidge \u0027long with them, but to find a Beein\u0027 fur her wheer she can fisherate for herself.\u0027 (A Beein\u0027 signifies, in that dialect, a home, and to fisherate is to provide.) \u0027Fur which purpose,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, \u0027I means to make her a \u0027lowance afore I go, as\u0027ll leave her pretty comfort\u0027ble. She\u0027s the faithfullest of creeturs. \u0027Tan\u0027t to be expected, of course, at her time of life, and being lone and lorn, as the good old Mawther is to be knocked about aboardship, and in the woods and wilds of a new and fur-away country. So that\u0027s what I\u0027m a-going to do with her.\u0027 He forgot nobody. He thought of everybody\u0027s claims and strivings, but his own. \u0027Em\u0027ly,\u0027 he continued, \u0027will keep along with me - poor child, she\u0027s sore in need of peace and rest! - until such time as we goes upon our voyage. She\u0027ll work at them clothes, as must be made; and I hope her troubles will begin to seem longer ago than they was, wen she finds herself once more by her rough but loving uncle.\u0027 MY aunt nodded confirmation of this hope, and imparted great satisfaction to Mr. Peggotty. \u0027Theer\u0027s one thing furder, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 said he, putting his hand in his breast-pocket, and gravely taking out the little paper bundle I had seen before, which he unrolled on the table. \u0027Theer\u0027s these here banknotes - fifty pound, and ten. To them I wish to add the money as she come away with. I\u0027ve asked her about that (but not saying why), and have added of it up. I an\u0027t a scholar. Would you be so kind as see how \u0027tis?\u0027 He handed me, apologetically for his scholarship, a piece of paper, and observed me while I looked it over. It was quite right. \u0027Thankee, sir,\u0027 he said, taking it back. \u0027This money, if you doen\u0027t see objections, Mas\u0027r Davy, I shall put up jest afore I go, in a cover directed to him; and put that up in another, directed to his mother. I shall tell her, in no more wureds than I speak to you, what it\u0027s the price on; and that I\u0027m gone, and past receiving of it back.\u0027 I told him that I thought it would be right to do so - that I was thoroughly convinced it would be, since he felt it to be right. \u0027I said that theer was on\u0027y one thing furder,\u0027 he proceeded with a grave smile, when he had made up his little bundle again, and put it in his pocket; \u0027but theer was two. I warn\u0027t sure in my mind, wen I come out this morning, as I could go and break to Ham, of my own self, what had so thankfully happened. So I writ a letter while I was out, and put it in the post-office, telling of \u0027em how all was as \u0027tis; and that I should come down tomorrow to unload my mind of what little needs a-doing of down theer, and, most-like, take my farewell leave of Yarmouth.\u0027 \u0027And do you wish me to go with you?\u0027 said I, seeing that he left something unsaid. \u0027If you could do me that kind favour, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 he replied. \u0027I know the sight on you would cheer \u0027em up a bit.\u0027 My little Dora being in good spirits, and very desirous that I should go - as I found on talking it over with her - I readily pledged myself to accompany him in accordance with his wish. Next morning, consequently, we were on the Yarmouth coach, and again travelling over the old ground. As we passed along the familiar street at night - Mr. Peggotty, in despite of all my remonstrances, carrying my bag - I glanced into Omer and Joram\u0027s shop, and saw my old friend Mr. Omer there, smoking his pipe. I felt reluctant to be present, when Mr. Peggotty first met his sister and Ham; and made Mr. Omer my excuse for lingering behind. \u0027How is Mr. Omer, after this long time?\u0027 said I, going in. He fanned away the smoke of his pipe, that he might get a better view of me, and soon recognized me with great delight. \u0027I should get up, sir, to acknowledge such an honour as this visit,\u0027 said he, \u0027only my limbs are rather out of sorts, and I am wheeled about. With the exception of my limbs and my breath, howsoever, I am as hearty as a man can be, I\u0027m thankful to say.\u0027 I congratulated him on his contented looks and his good spirits, and saw, now, that his easy-chair went on wheels. \u0027It\u0027s an ingenious thing, ain\u0027t it?\u0027 he inquired, following the direction of my glance, and polishing the elbow with his arm. \u0027It runs as light as a feather, and tracks as true as a mail-coach. Bless you, my little Minnie - my grand-daughter you know, Minnie\u0027s child - puts her little strength against the back, gives it a shove, and away we go, as clever and merry as ever you see anything! And I tell you what - it\u0027s a most uncommon chair to smoke a pipe in.\u0027 I never saw such a good old fellow to make the best of a thing, and find out the enjoyment of it, as Mr. Omer. He was as radiant, as if his chair, his asthma, and the failure of his limbs, were the various branches of a great invention for enhancing the luxury of a pipe. \u0027I see more of the world, I can assure you,\u0027 said Mr. Omer, \u0027in this chair, than ever I see out of it. You\u0027d be surprised at the number of people that looks in of a day to have a chat. You really would! There\u0027s twice as much in the newspaper, since I\u0027ve taken to this chair, as there used to be. As to general reading, dear me, what a lot of it I do get through! That\u0027s what I feel so strong, you know! If it had been my eyes, what should I have done? If it had been my ears, what should I have done? Being my limbs, what does it signify? Why, my limbs only made my breath shorter when I used \u0027em. And now, if I want to go out into the street or down to the sands, I\u0027ve only got to call Dick, Joram\u0027s youngest \u0027prentice, and away I go in my own carriage, like the Lord Mayor of London.\u0027 He half suffocated himself with laughing here. \u0027Lord bless you!\u0027 said Mr. Omer, resuming his pipe, \u0027a man must take the fat with the lean; that\u0027s what he must make up his mind to, in this life. Joram does a fine business. Ex-cellent business!\u0027 \u0027I am very glad to hear it,\u0027 said I. \u0027I knew you would be,\u0027 said Mr. Omer. \u0027And Joram and Minnie are like Valentines. What more can a man expect? What\u0027s his limbs to that!\u0027 His supreme contempt for his own limbs, as he sat smoking, was one of the pleasantest oddities I have ever encountered. \u0027And since I\u0027ve took to general reading, you\u0027ve took to general writing, eh, sir?\u0027 said Mr. Omer, surveying me admiringly. \u0027What a lovely work that was of yours! What expressions in it! I read it every word - every word. And as to feeling sleepy! Not at all!\u0027 I laughingly expressed my satisfaction, but I must confess that I thought this association of ideas significant. \u0027I give you my word and honour, sir,\u0027 said Mr. Omer, \u0027that when I lay that book upon the table, and look at it outside; compact in three separate and indiwidual wollumes - one, two, three; I am as proud as Punch to think that I once had the honour of being connected with your family. And dear me, it\u0027s a long time ago, now, ain\u0027t it? Over at Blunderstone. With a pretty little party laid along with the other party. And you quite a small party then, yourself. Dear, dear!\u0027 I changed the subject by referring to Emily. After assuring him that I did not forget how interested he had always been in her, and how kindly he had always treated her, I gave him a general account of her restoration to her uncle by the aid of Martha; which I knew would please the old man. He listened with the utmost attention, and said, feelingly, when I had done: \u0027I am rejoiced at it, sir! It\u0027s the best news I have heard for many a day. Dear, dear, dear! And what\u0027s going to be undertook for that unfortunate young woman, Martha, now?\u0027 \u0027You touch a point that my thoughts have been dwelling on since yesterday,\u0027 said I, \u0027but on which I can give you no information yet, Mr. Omer. Mr. Peggotty has not alluded to it, and I have a delicacy in doing so. I am sure he has not forgotten it. He forgets nothing that is disinterested and good.\u0027 \u0027Because you know,\u0027 said Mr. Omer, taking himself up, where he had left off, \u0027whatever is done, I should wish to be a member of. Put me down for anything you may consider right, and let me know. I never could think the girl all bad, and I am glad to find she\u0027s not. So will my daughter Minnie be. Young women are contradictory creatures in some things - her mother was just the same as her - but their hearts are soft and kind. It\u0027s all show with Minnie, about Martha. Why she should consider it necessary to make any show, I don\u0027t undertake to tell you. But it\u0027s all show, bless you. She\u0027d do her any kindness in private. So, put me down for whatever you may consider right, will you be so good? and drop me a line where to forward it. Dear me!\u0027 said Mr. Omer, \u0027when a man is drawing on to a time of life, where the two ends of life meet; when he finds himself, however hearty he is, being wheeled about for the second time, in a speeches of go-cart; he should be over-rejoiced to do a kindness if he can. He wants plenty. And I don\u0027t speak of myself, particular,\u0027 said Mr. Omer, \u0027because, sir, the way I look at it is, that we are all drawing on to the bottom of the hill, whatever age we are, on account of time never standing still for a single moment. So let us always do a kindness, and be over-rejoiced. To be sure!\u0027 He knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and put it on a ledge in the back of his chair, expressly made for its reception. \u0027There\u0027s Em\u0027ly\u0027s cousin, him that she was to have been married to,\u0027 said Mr. Omer, rubbing his hands feebly, \u0027as fine a fellow as there is in Yarmouth! He\u0027ll come and talk or read to me, in the evening, for an hour together sometimes. That\u0027s a kindness, I should call it! All his life\u0027s a kindness.\u0027 \u0027I am going to see him now,\u0027 said I. \u0027Are you?\u0027 said Mr. Omer. \u0027Tell him I was hearty, and sent my respects. Minnie and Joram\u0027s at a ball. They would be as proud to see you as I am, if they was at home. Minnie won\u0027t hardly go out at all, you see, \"on account of father\", as she says. So I swore tonight, that if she didn\u0027t go, I\u0027d go to bed at six. In consequence of which,\u0027 Mr. Omer shook himself and his chair with laughter at the success of his device, \u0027she and Joram\u0027s at a ball.\u0027 I shook hands with him, and wished him good night. \u0027Half a minute, sir,\u0027 said Mr. Omer. \u0027If you was to go without seeing my little elephant, you\u0027d lose the best of sights. You never see such a sight! Minnie!\u0027 A musical little voice answered, from somewhere upstairs, \u0027I am coming, grandfather!\u0027 and a pretty little girl with long, flaxen, curling hair, soon came running into the shop. \u0027This is my little elephant, sir,\u0027 said Mr. Omer, fondling the child. \u0027Siamese breed, sir. Now, little elephant!\u0027 The little elephant set the door of the parlour open, enabling me to see that, in these latter days, it was converted into a bedroom for Mr. Omer who could not be easily conveyed upstairs; and then hid her pretty forehead, and tumbled her long hair, against the back of Mr. Omer\u0027s chair. \u0027The elephant butts, you know, sir,\u0027 said Mr. Omer, winking, \u0027when he goes at a object. Once, elephant. Twice. Three times!\u0027 At this signal, the little elephant, with a dexterity that was next to marvellous in so small an animal, whisked the chair round with Mr. Omer in it, and rattled it off, pell-mell, into the parlour, without touching the door-post: Mr. Omer indescribably enjoying the performance, and looking back at me on the road as if it were the triumphant issue of his life\u0027s exertions. After a stroll about the town I went to Ham\u0027s house. Peggotty had now removed here for good; and had let her own house to the successor of Mr. Barkis in the carrying business, who had paid her very well for the good-will, cart, and horse. I believe the very same slow horse that Mr. Barkis drove was still at work. I found them in the neat kitchen, accompanied by Mrs. Gummidge, who had been fetched from the old boat by Mr. Peggotty himself. I doubt if she could have been induced to desert her post, by anyone else. He had evidently told them all. Both Peggotty and Mrs. Gummidge had their aprons to their eyes, and Ham had just stepped out \u0027to take a turn on the beach\u0027. He presently came home, very glad to see me; and I hope they were all the better for my being there. We spoke, with some approach to cheerfulness, of Mr. Peggotty\u0027s growing rich in a new country, and of the wonders he would describe in his letters. We said nothing of Emily by name, but distantly referred to her more than once. Ham was the serenest of the party. But, Peggotty told me, when she lighted me to a little chamber where the Crocodile book was lying ready for me on the table, that he always was the same. She believed (she told me, crying) that he was broken-hearted; though he was as full of courage as of sweetness, and worked harder and better than any boat-builder in any yard in all that part. There were times, she said, of an evening, when he talked of their old life in the boat-house; and then he mentioned Emily as a child. But, he never mentioned her as a woman. I thought I had read in his face that he would like to speak to me alone. I therefore resolved to put myself in his way next evening, as he came home from his work. Having settled this with myself, I fell asleep. That night, for the first time in all those many nights, the candle was taken out of the window, Mr. Peggotty swung in his old hammock in the old boat, and the wind murmured with the old sound round his head. All next day, he was occupied in disposing of his fishing-boat and tackle; in packing up, and sending to London by waggon, such of his little domestic possessions as he thought would be useful to him; and in parting with the rest, or bestowing them on Mrs. Gummidge. She was with him all day. As I had a sorrowful wish to see the old place once more, before it was locked up, I engaged to meet them there in the evening. But I so arranged it, as that I should meet Ham first. It was easy to come in his way, as I knew where he worked. I met him at a retired part of the sands, which I knew he would cross, and turned back with him, that he might have leisure to speak to me if he really wished. I had not mistaken the expression of his face. We had walked but a little way together, when he said, without looking at me: \u0027Mas\u0027r Davy, have you seen her?\u0027 \u0027Only for a moment, when she was in a swoon,\u0027 I softly answered. We walked a little farther, and he said: \u0027Mas\u0027r Davy, shall you see her, d\u0027ye think?\u0027 \u0027It would be too painful to her, perhaps,\u0027 said I. \u0027I have thowt of that,\u0027 he replied. \u0027So \u0027twould, sir, so \u0027twould.\u0027 \u0027But, Ham,\u0027 said I, gently, \u0027if there is anything that I could write to her, for you, in case I could not tell it; if there is anything you would wish to make known to her through me; I should consider it a sacred trust.\u0027 \u0027I am sure on\u0027t. I thankee, sir, most kind! I think theer is something I could wish said or wrote.\u0027 \u0027What is it?\u0027 We walked a little farther in silence, and then he spoke. \u0027\u0027Tan\u0027t that I forgive her. \u0027Tan\u0027t that so much. \u0027Tis more as I beg of her to forgive me, for having pressed my affections upon her. Odd times, I think that if I hadn\u0027t had her promise fur to marry me, sir, she was that trustful of me, in a friendly way, that she\u0027d have told me what was struggling in her mind, and would have counselled with me, and I might have saved her.\u0027 I pressed his hand. \u0027Is that all?\u0027 \u0027Theer\u0027s yet a something else,\u0027 he returned, \u0027if I can say it, Mas\u0027r Davy.\u0027 We walked on, farther than we had walked yet, before he spoke again. He was not crying when he made the pauses I shall express by lines. He was merely collecting himself to speak very plainly. \u0027I loved her - and I love the mem\u0027ry of her - too deep - to be able to lead her to believe of my own self as I\u0027m a happy man. I could only be happy - by forgetting of her - and I\u0027m afeerd I couldn\u0027t hardly bear as she should be told I done that. But if you, being so full of learning, Mas\u0027r Davy, could think of anything to say as might bring her to believe I wasn\u0027t greatly hurt: still loving of her, and mourning for her: anything as might bring her to believe as I was not tired of my life, and yet was hoping fur to see her without blame, wheer the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest - anything as would ease her sorrowful mind, and yet not make her think as I could ever marry, or as \u0027twas possible that anyone could ever be to me what she was - I should ask of you to say that - with my prayers for her - that was so dear.\u0027 I pressed his manly hand again, and told him I would charge myself to do this as well as I could. \u0027I thankee, sir,\u0027 he answered. \u0027\u0027Twas kind of you to meet me. \u0027Twas kind of you to bear him company down. Mas\u0027r Davy, I unnerstan\u0027 very well, though my aunt will come to Lon\u0027on afore they sail, and they\u0027ll unite once more, that I am not like to see him agen. I fare to feel sure on\u0027t. We doen\u0027t say so, but so \u0027twill be, and better so. The last you see on him - the very last - will you give him the lovingest duty and thanks of the orphan, as he was ever more than a father to?\u0027 This I also promised, faithfully. \u0027I thankee agen, sir,\u0027 he said, heartily shaking hands. \u0027I know wheer you\u0027re a-going. Good-bye!\u0027 With a slight wave of his hand, as though to explain to me that he could not enter the old place, he turned away. As I looked after his figure, crossing the waste in the moonlight, I saw him turn his face towards a strip of silvery light upon the sea, and pass on, looking at it, until he was a shadow in the distance. The door of the boat-house stood open when I approached; and, on entering, I found it emptied of all its furniture, saving one of the old lockers, on which Mrs. Gummidge, with a basket on her knee, was seated, looking at Mr. Peggotty. He leaned his elbow on the rough chimney-piece, and gazed upon a few expiring embers in the grate; but he raised his head, hopefully, on my coming in, and spoke in a cheery manner. \u0027Come, according to promise, to bid farewell to \u0027t, eh, Mas\u0027r Davy?\u0027 he said, taking up the candle. \u0027Bare enough, now, an\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Indeed you have made good use of the time,\u0027 said I. \u0027Why, we have not been idle, sir. Missis Gummidge has worked like a - I doen\u0027t know what Missis Gummidge an\u0027t worked like,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, looking at her, at a loss for a sufficiently approving simile. Mrs. Gummidge, leaning on her basket, made no observation. \u0027Theer\u0027s the very locker that you used to sit on, \u0027long with Em\u0027ly!\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, in a whisper. \u0027I\u0027m a-going to carry it away with me, last of all. And heer\u0027s your old little bedroom, see, Mas\u0027r Davy! A\u0027most as bleak tonight, as \u0027art could wish!\u0027 In truth, the wind, though it was low, had a solemn sound, and crept around the deserted house with a whispered wailing that was very mournful. Everything was gone, down to the little mirror with the oyster-shell frame. I thought of myself, lying here, when that first great change was being wrought at home. I thought of the blue-eyed child who had enchanted me. I thought of Steerforth: and a foolish, fearful fancy came upon me of his being near at hand, and liable to be met at any turn. \u0027\u0027Tis like to be long,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, in a low voice, \u0027afore the boat finds new tenants. They look upon \u0027t, down beer, as being unfortunate now!\u0027 \u0027Does it belong to anybody in the neighbourhood?\u0027 I asked. \u0027To a mast-maker up town,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty. \u0027I\u0027m a-going to give the key to him tonight.\u0027 We looked into the other little room, and came back to Mrs. Gummidge, sitting on the locker, whom Mr. Peggotty, putting the light on the chimney-piece, requested to rise, that he might carry it outside the door before extinguishing the candle. \u0027Dan\u0027l,\u0027 said Mrs. Gummidge, suddenly deserting her basket, and clinging to his arm \u0027my dear Dan\u0027l, the parting words I speak in this house is, I mustn\u0027t be left behind. Doen\u0027t ye think of leaving me behind, Dan\u0027l! Oh, doen\u0027t ye ever do it!\u0027 Mr. Peggotty, taken aback, looked from Mrs. Gummidge to me, and from me to Mrs. Gummidge, as if he had been awakened from a sleep. \u0027Doen\u0027t ye, dearest Dan\u0027l, doen\u0027t ye!\u0027 cried Mrs. Gummidge, fervently. \u0027Take me \u0027long with you, Dan\u0027l, take me \u0027long with you and Em\u0027ly! I\u0027ll be your servant, constant and trew. If there\u0027s slaves in them parts where you\u0027re a-going, I\u0027ll be bound to you for one, and happy, but doen\u0027t ye leave me behind, Dan\u0027l, that\u0027s a deary dear!\u0027 \u0027My good soul,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, shaking his head, \u0027you doen\u0027t know what a long voyage, and what a hard life \u0027tis!\u0027 \u0027Yes, I do, Dan\u0027l! I can guess!\u0027 cried Mrs. Gummidge. \u0027But my parting words under this roof is, I shall go into the house and die, if I am not took. I can dig, Dan\u0027l. I can work. I can live hard. I can be loving and patient now - more than you think, Dan\u0027l, if you\u0027ll on\u0027y try me. I wouldn\u0027t touch the \u0027lowance, not if I was dying of want, Dan\u0027l Peggotty; but I\u0027ll go with you and Em\u0027ly, if you\u0027ll on\u0027y let me, to the world\u0027s end! I know how \u0027tis; I know you think that I am lone and lorn; but, deary love, \u0027tan\u0027t so no more! I ain\u0027t sat here, so long, a-watching, and a-thinking of your trials, without some good being done me. Mas\u0027r Davy, speak to him for me! I knows his ways, and Em\u0027ly\u0027s, and I knows their sorrows, and can be a comfort to \u0027em, some odd times, and labour for \u0027em allus! Dan\u0027l, deary Dan\u0027l, let me go \u0027long with you!\u0027 And Mrs. Gummidge took his hand, and kissed it with a homely pathos and affection, in a homely rapture of devotion and gratitude, that he well deserved. We brought the locker out, extinguished the candle, fastened the door on the outside, and left the old boat close shut up, a dark speck in the cloudy night. Next day, when we were returning to London outside the coach, Mrs. Gummidge and her basket were on the seat behind, and Mrs. Gummidge was happy.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101/5378.html","bookId":208,"book":{"id":208,"title":"David Copperfield大卫·科波菲尔","description":"简介： David Copperfield or The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a novel in 185...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290216055bf31c.jpg","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM"}}
