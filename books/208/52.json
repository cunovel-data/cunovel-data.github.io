{"id":6462,"no":52,"title":"Chapter 52","content":"When the time Mr. Micawber had appointed so mysteriously, was within four-and-twenty hours of being come, my aunt and I consulted how we should proceed; for my aunt was very unwilling to leave Dora. Ah! how easily I carried Dora up and down stairs, now! We were disposed, notwithstanding Mr. Micawber\u0027s stipulation for my aunt\u0027s attendance, to arrange that she should stay at home, and be represented by Mr. Dick and me. In short, we had resolved to take this course, when Dora again unsettled us by declaring that she never would forgive herself, and never would forgive her bad boy, if my aunt remained behind, on any pretence. \u0027I won\u0027t speak to you,\u0027 said Dora, shaking her curls at my aunt. \u0027I\u0027ll be disagreeable! I\u0027ll make Jip bark at you all day. I shall be sure that you really are a cross old thing, if you don\u0027t go!\u0027 \u0027Tut, Blossom!\u0027 laughed my aunt. \u0027You know you can\u0027t do without me!\u0027 \u0027Yes, I can,\u0027 said Dora. \u0027You are no use to me at all. You never run up and down stairs for me, all day long. You never sit and tell me stories about Doady, when his shoes were worn out, and he was covered with dust - oh, what a poor little mite of a fellow! You never do anything at all to please me, do you, dear?\u0027 Dora made haste to kiss my aunt, and say, \u0027Yes, you do! I\u0027m only joking!\u0027- lest my aunt should think she really meant it. \u0027But, aunt,\u0027 said Dora, coaxingly, \u0027now listen. You must go. I shall tease you, \u0027till you let me have my own way about it. I shall lead my naughty boy such a life, if he don\u0027t make you go. I shall make myself so disagreeable - and so will Jip! You\u0027ll wish you had gone, like a good thing, for ever and ever so long, if you don\u0027t go. Besides,\u0027 said Dora, putting back her hair, and looking wonderingly at my aunt and me, \u0027why shouldn\u0027t you both go? I am not very ill indeed. Am I?\u0027 \u0027Why, what a question!\u0027 cried my aunt. \u0027What a fancy!\u0027 said I. \u0027Yes! I know I am a silly little thing!\u0027 said Dora, slowly looking from one of us to the other, and then putting up her pretty lips to kiss us as she lay upon her couch. \u0027Well, then, you must both go, or I shall not believe you; and then I shall cry!\u0027 I saw, in my aunt\u0027s face, that she began to give way now, and Dora brightened again, as she saw it too. \u0027You\u0027ll come back with so much to tell me, that it\u0027ll take at least a week to make me understand!\u0027 said Dora. \u0027Because I know I shan\u0027t understand, for a length of time, if there\u0027s any business in it. And there\u0027s sure to be some business in it! If there\u0027s anything to add up, besides, I don\u0027t know when I shall make it out; and my bad boy will look so miserable all the time. There! Now you\u0027ll go, won\u0027t you? You\u0027ll only be gone one night, and Jip will take care of me while you are gone. Doady will carry me upstairs before you go, and I won\u0027t come down again till you come back; and you shall take Agnes a dreadfully scolding letter from me, because she has never been to see us!\u0027 We agreed, without any more consultation, that we would both go, and that Dora was a little Impostor, who feigned to be rather unwell, because she liked to be petted. She was greatly pleased, and very merry; and we four, that is to say, my aunt, Mr. Dick, Traddles, and I, went down to Canterbury by the Dover mail that night. At the hotel where Mr. Micawber had requested us to await him, which we got into, with some trouble, in the middle of the night, I found a letter, importing that he would appear in the morning punctually at half past nine. After which, we went shivering, at that uncomfortable hour, to our respective beds, through various close passages; which smelt as if they had been steeped, for ages, in a solution of soup and stables. Early in the morning, I sauntered through the dear old tranquil streets, and again mingled with the shadows of the venerable gateways and churches. The rooks were sailing about the cathedral towers; and the towers themselves, overlooking many a long unaltered mile of the rich country and its pleasant streams, were cutting the bright morning air, as if there were no such thing as change on earth. Yet the bells, when they sounded, told me sorrowfully of change in everything; told me of their own age, and my pretty Dora\u0027s youth; and of the many, never old, who had lived and loved and died, while the reverberations of the bells had hummed through the rusty armour of the Black Prince hanging up within, and, motes upon the deep of Time, had lost themselves in air, as circles do in water. I looked at the old house from the corner of the street, but did not go nearer to it, lest, being observed, I might unwittingly do any harm to the design I had come to aid. The early sun was striking edgewise on its gables and lattice-windows, touching them with gold; and some beams of its old peace seemed to touch my heart. I strolled into the country for an hour or so, and then returned by the main street, which in the interval had shaken off its last night\u0027s sleep. Among those who were stirring in the shops, I saw my ancient enemy the butcher, now advanced to top-boots and a baby, and in business for himself. He was nursing the baby, and appeared to be a benignant member of society. We all became very anxious and impatient, when we sat down to breakfast. As it approached nearer and nearer to half past nine o\u0027clock, our restless expectation of Mr. Micawber increased. At last we made no more pretence of attending to the meal, which, except with Mr. Dick, had been a mere form from the first; but my aunt walked up and down the room, Traddles sat upon the sofa affecting to read the paper with his eyes on the ceiling; and I looked out of the window to give early notice of Mr. Micawber\u0027s coming. Nor had I long to watch, for, at the first chime of the half hour, he appeared in the street. \u0027Here he is,\u0027 said I, \u0027and not in his legal attire!\u0027 My aunt tied the strings of her bonnet (she had come down to breakfast in it), and put on her shawl, as if she were ready for anything that was resolute and uncompromising. Traddles buttoned his coat with a determined air. Mr. Dick, disturbed by these formidable appearances, but feeling it necessary to imitate them, pulled his hat, with both hands, as firmly over his ears as he possibly could; and instantly took it off again, to welcome Mr. Micawber. \u0027Gentlemen, and madam,\u0027 said Mr. Micawber, \u0027good morning! My dear sir,\u0027 to Mr. Dick, who shook hands with him violently, \u0027you are extremely good.\u0027 \u0027Have you breakfasted?\u0027 said Mr. Dick. \u0027Have a chop!\u0027 \u0027Not for the world, my good sir!\u0027 cried Mr. Micawber, stopping him on his way to the bell; \u0027appetite and myself, Mr. Dixon, have long been strangers.\u0027 Mr. Dixon was so well pleased with his new name, and appeared to think it so obliging in Mr. Micawber to confer it upon him, that he shook hands with him again, and laughed rather childishly. \u0027Dick,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027attention!\u0027 Mr. Dick recovered himself, with a blush. \u0027Now, sir,\u0027 said my aunt to Mr. Micawber, as she put on her gloves, \u0027we are ready for Mount Vesuvius, or anything else, as soon as YOU please.\u0027 \u0027Madam,\u0027 returned Mr. Micawber, \u0027I trust you will shortly witness an eruption. Mr. Traddles, I have your permission, I believe, to mention here that we have been in communication together?\u0027 \u0027It is undoubtedly the fact, Copperfield,\u0027 said Traddles, to whom I looked in surprise. \u0027Mr. Micawber has consulted me in reference to what he has in contemplation; and I have advised him to the best of my judgement.\u0027 \u0027Unless I deceive myself, Mr. Traddles,\u0027 pursued Mr. Micawber, \u0027what I contemplate is a disclosure of an important nature.\u0027 \u0027Highly so,\u0027 said Traddles. \u0027Perhaps, under such circumstances, madam and gentlemen,\u0027 said Mr. Micawber, \u0027you will do me the favour to submit yourselves, for the moment, to the direction of one who, however unworthy to be regarded in any other light but as a Waif and Stray upon the shore of human nature, is still your fellow-man, though crushed out of his original form by individual errors, and the accumulative force of a combination of circumstances?\u0027 \u0027We have perfect confidence in you, Mr. Micawber,\u0027 said I, \u0027and will do what you please.\u0027 \u0027Mr. Copperfield,\u0027 returned Mr. Micawber, \u0027your confidence is not, at the existing juncture, ill-bestowed. I would beg to be allowed a start of five minutes by the clock; and then to receive the present company, inquiring for Miss Wickfield, at the office of Wickfield and Heep, whose Stipendiary I am.\u0027 My aunt and I looked at Traddles, who nodded his approval. \u0027I have no more,\u0027 observed Mr. Micawber, \u0027to say at present.\u0027 With which, to my infinite surprise, he included us all in a comprehensive bow, and disappeared; his manner being extremely distant, and his face extremely pale. Traddles only smiled, and shook his head (with his hair standing upright on the top of it), when I looked to him for an explanation; so I took out my watch, and, as a last resource, counted off the five minutes. My aunt, with her own watch in her hand, did the like. When the time was expired, Traddles gave her his arm; and we all went out together to the old house, without saying one word on the way. We found Mr. Micawber at his desk, in the turret office on the ground floor, either writing, or pretending to write, hard. The large office-ruler was stuck into his waistcoat, and was not so well concealed but that a foot or more of that instrument protruded from his bosom, like a new kind of shirt-frill. As it appeared to me that I was expected to speak, I said aloud: \u0027How do you do, Mr. Micawber?\u0027 \u0027Mr. Copperfield,\u0027 said Mr. Micawber, gravely, \u0027I hope I see you well?\u0027 \u0027Is Miss Wickfield at home?\u0027 said I. \u0027Mr. Wickfield is unwell in bed, sir, of a rheumatic fever,\u0027 he returned; \u0027but Miss Wickfield, I have no doubt, will be happy to see old friends. Will you walk in, sir?\u0027 He preceded us to the dining-room - the first room I had entered in that house - and flinging open the door of Mr. Wickfield\u0027s former office, said, in a sonorous voice: \u0027Miss Trotwood, Mr. David Copperfield, Mr. Thomas Traddles, and Mr. Dixon!\u0027 I had not seen Uriah Heep since the time of the blow. Our visit astonished him, evidently; not the less, I dare say, because it astonished ourselves. He did not gather his eyebrows together, for he had none worth mentioning; but he frowned to that degree that he almost closed his small eyes, while the hurried raising of his grisly hand to his chin betrayed some trepidation or surprise. This was only when we were in the act of entering his room, and when I caught a glance at him over my aunt\u0027s shoulder. A moment afterwards, he was as fawning and as humble as ever. \u0027Well, I am sure,\u0027 he said. \u0027This is indeed an unexpected pleasure! To have, as I may say, all friends round St. Paul\u0027s at once, is a treat unlooked for! Mr. Copperfield, I hope I see you well, and - if I may umbly express myself so - friendly towards them as is ever your friends, whether or not. Mrs. Copperfield, sir, I hope she\u0027s getting on. We have been made quite uneasy by the poor accounts we have had of her state, lately, I do assure you.\u0027 I felt ashamed to let him take my hand, but I did not know yet what else to do. \u0027Things are changed in this office, Miss Trotwood, since I was an umble clerk, and held your pony; ain\u0027t they?\u0027 said Uriah, with his sickliest smile. \u0027But I am not changed, Miss Trotwood.\u0027 \u0027Well, sir,\u0027 returned my aunt, \u0027to tell you the truth, I think you are pretty constant to the promise of your youth; if that\u0027s any satisfaction to you.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, Miss Trotwood,\u0027 said Uriah, writhing in his ungainly manner, \u0027for your good opinion! Micawber, tell \u0027em to let Miss Agnes know - and mother. Mother will be quite in a state, when she sees the present company!\u0027 said Uriah, setting chairs. \u0027You are not busy, Mr. Heep?\u0027 said Traddles, whose eye the cunning red eye accidentally caught, as it at once scrutinized and evaded us. \u0027No, Mr. Traddles,\u0027 replied Uriah, resuming his official seat, and squeezing his bony hands, laid palm to palm between his bony knees. \u0027Not so much so as I could wish. But lawyers, sharks, and leeches, are not easily satisfied, you know! Not but what myself and Micawber have our hands pretty full, in general, on account of Mr. Wickfield\u0027s being hardly fit for any occupation, sir. But it\u0027s a pleasure as well as a duty, I am sure, to work for him. You\u0027ve not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield, I think, Mr. Traddles? I believe I\u0027ve only had the honour of seeing you once myself?\u0027 \u0027No, I have not been intimate with Mr. Wickfield,\u0027 returned Traddles; \u0027or I might perhaps have waited on you long ago, Mr. Heep.\u0027 There was something in the tone of this reply, which made Uriah look at the speaker again, with a very sinister and suspicious expression. But, seeing only Traddles, with his good-natured face, simple manner, and hair on end, he dismissed it as he replied, with a jerk of his whole body, but especially his throat: \u0027I am sorry for that, Mr. Traddles. You would have admired him as much as we all do. His little failings would only have endeared him to you the more. But if you would like to hear my fellow-partner eloquently spoken of, I should refer you to Copperfield. The family is a subject he\u0027s very strong upon, if you never heard him.\u0027 I was prevented from disclaiming the compliment (if I should have done so, in any case), by the entrance of Agnes, now ushered in by Mr. Micawber. She was not quite so self-possessed as usual, I thought; and had evidently undergone anxiety and fatigue. But her earnest cordiality, and her quiet beauty, shone with the gentler lustre for it. I saw Uriah watch her while she greeted us; and he reminded me of an ugly and rebellious genie watching a good spirit. In the meanwhile, some slight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles; and Traddles, unobserved except by me, went out. \u0027Don\u0027t wait, Micawber,\u0027 said Uriah. Mr. Micawber, with his hand upon the ruler in his breast, stood erect before the door, most unmistakably contemplating one of his fellow-men, and that man his employer. \u0027What are you waiting for?\u0027 said Uriah. \u0027Micawber! did you hear me tell you not to wait?\u0027 \u0027Yes!\u0027 replied the immovable Mr. Micawber. \u0027Then why DO you wait?\u0027 said Uriah. \u0027Because I - in short, choose,\u0027 replied Mr. Micawber, with a burst. Uriah\u0027s cheeks lost colour, and an unwholesome paleness, still faintly tinged by his pervading red, overspread them. He looked at Mr. Micawber attentively, with his whole face breathing short and quick in every feature. \u0027You are a dissipated fellow, as all the world knows,\u0027 he said, with an effort at a smile, \u0027and I am afraid you\u0027ll oblige me to get rid of you. Go along! I\u0027ll talk to you presently.\u0027 \u0027If there is a scoundrel on this earth,\u0027 said Mr. Micawber, suddenly breaking out again with the utmost vehemence, \u0027with whom I have already talked too much, that scoundrel\u0027s name is - HEEP!\u0027 Uriah fell back, as if he had been struck or stung. Looking slowly round upon us with the darkest and wickedest expression that his face could wear, he said, in a lower voice: \u0027Oho! This is a conspiracy! You have met here by appointment! You are playing Booty with my clerk, are you, Copperfield? Now, take care. You\u0027ll make nothing of this. We understand each other, you and me. There\u0027s no love between us. You were always a puppy with a proud stomach, from your first coming here; and you envy me my rise, do you? None of your plots against me; I\u0027ll counterplot you! Micawber, you be off. I\u0027ll talk to you presently.\u0027 \u0027Mr. Micawber,\u0027 said I, \u0027there is a sudden change in this fellow. in more respects than the extraordinary one of his speaking the truth in one particular, which assures me that he is brought to bay. Deal with him as he deserves!\u0027 \u0027You are a precious set of people, ain\u0027t you?\u0027 said Uriah, in the same low voice, and breaking out into a clammy heat, which he wiped from his forehead, with his long lean hand, \u0027to buy over my clerk, who is the very scum of society, - as you yourself were, Copperfield, you know it, before anyone had charity on you, - to defame me with his lies? Miss Trotwood, you had better stop this; or I\u0027ll stop your husband shorter than will be pleasant to you. I won\u0027t know your story professionally, for nothing, old lady! Miss Wickfield, if you have any love for your father, you had better not join that gang. I\u0027ll ruin him, if you do. Now, come! I have got some of you under the harrow. Think twice, before it goes over you. Think twice, you, Micawber, if you don\u0027t want to be crushed. I recommend you to take yourself off, and be talked to presently, you fool! while there\u0027s time to retreat. Where\u0027s mother?\u0027 he said, suddenly appearing to notice, with alarm, the absence of Traddles, and pulling down the bell-rope. \u0027Fine doings in a person\u0027s own house!\u0027 \u0027Mrs. Heep is here, sir,\u0027 said Traddles, returning with that worthy mother of a worthy son. \u0027I have taken the liberty of making myself known to her.\u0027 \u0027Who are you to make yourself known?\u0027 retorted Uriah. \u0027And what do you want here?\u0027 \u0027I am the agent and friend of Mr. Wickfield, sir,\u0027 said Traddles, in a composed and business-like way. \u0027And I have a power of attorney from him in my pocket, to act for him in all matters.\u0027 \u0027The old ass has drunk himself into a state of dotage,\u0027 said Uriah, turning uglier than before, \u0027and it has been got from him by fraud!\u0027 \u0027Something has been got from him by fraud, I know,\u0027 returned Traddles quietly; \u0027and so do you, Mr. Heep. We will refer that question, if you please, to Mr. Micawber.\u0027 \u0027Ury -!\u0027 Mrs. Heep began, with an anxious gesture. \u0027YOU hold your tongue, mother,\u0027 he returned; \u0027least said, soonest mended.\u0027 \u0027But, my Ury -\u0027 \u0027Will you hold your tongue, mother, and leave it to me?\u0027 Though I had long known that his servility was false, and all his pretences knavish and hollow, I had had no adequate conception of the extent of his hypocrisy, until I now saw him with his mask off. The suddenness with which he dropped it, when he perceived that it was useless to him; the malice, insolence, and hatred, he revealed; the leer with which he exulted, even at this moment, in the evil he had done - all this time being desperate too, and at his wits\u0027 end for the means of getting the better of us - though perfectly consistent with the experience I had of him, at first took even me by surprise, who had known him so long, and disliked him so heartily. I say nothing of the look he conferred on me, as he stood eyeing us, one after another; for I had always understood that he hated me, and I remembered the marks of my hand upon his cheek. But when his eyes passed on to Agnes, and I saw the rage with which he felt his power over her slipping away, and the exhibition, in their disappointment, of the odious passions that had led him to aspire to one whose virtues he could never appreciate or care for, I was shocked by the mere thought of her having lived, an hour, within sight of such a man. After some rubbing of the lower part of his face, and some looking at us with those bad eyes, over his grisly fingers, he made one more address to me, half whining, and half abusive. \u0027You think it justifiable, do you, Copperfield, you who pride yourself so much on your honour and all the rest of it, to sneak about my place, eaves-dropping with my clerk? If it had been ME, I shouldn\u0027t have wondered; for I don\u0027t make myself out a gentleman (though I never was in the streets either, as you were, according to Micawber), but being you! - And you\u0027re not afraid of doing this, either? You don\u0027t think at all of what I shall do, in return; or of getting yourself into trouble for conspiracy and so forth? Very well. We shall see! Mr. What\u0027s-your-name, you were going to refer some question to Micawber. There\u0027s your referee. Why don\u0027t you make him speak? He has learnt his lesson, I see.\u0027 Seeing that what he said had no effect on me or any of us, he sat on the edge of his table with his hands in his pockets, and one of his splay feet twisted round the other leg, waiting doggedly for what might follow. Mr. Micawber, whose impetuosity I had restrained thus far with the greatest difficulty, and who had repeatedly interposed with the first syllable Of SCOUN-drel! without getting to the second, now burst forward, drew the ruler from his breast (apparently as a defensive weapon), and produced from his pocket a foolscap document, folded in the form of a large letter. Opening this packet, with his old flourish, and glancing at the contents, as if he cherished an artistic admiration of their style of composition, he began to read as follows: \u0027\"Dear Miss Trotwood and gentlemen -\"\u0027 \u0027Bless and save the man!\u0027 exclaimed my aunt in a low voice. \u0027He\u0027d write letters by the ream, if it was a capital offence!\u0027 Mr. Micawber, without hearing her, went on. \u0027\"In appearing before you to denounce probably the most consummate Villain that has ever existed,\"\u0027 Mr. Micawber, without looking off the letter, pointed the ruler, like a ghostly truncheon, at Uriah Heep, \u0027\"I ask no consideration for myself. The victim, from my cradle, of pecuniary liabilities to which I have been unable to respond, I have ever been the sport and toy of debasing circumstances. Ignominy, Want, Despair, and Madness, have, collectively or separately, been the attendants of my career.\"\u0027 The relish with which Mr. Micawber described himself as a prey to these dismal calamities, was only to be equalled by the emphasis with which he read his letter; and the kind of homage he rendered to it with a roll of his head, when he thought he had hit a sentence very hard indeed. \u0027\"In an accumulation of Ignominy, Want, Despair, and Madness, I entered the office - or, as our lively neighbour the Gaul would term it, the Bureau - of the Firm, nominally conducted under the appellation of Wickfield and - HEEP, but in reality, wielded by - HEEP alone. HEEP, and only HEEP, is the mainspring of that machine. HEEP, and only HEEP, is the Forger and the Cheat.\"\u0027 Uriah, more blue than white at these words, made a dart at the letter, as if to tear it in pieces. Mr. Micawber, with a perfect miracle of dexterity or luck, caught his advancing knuckles with the ruler, and disabled his right hand. It dropped at the wrist, as if it were broken. The blow sounded as if it had fallen on wood. \u0027The Devil take you!\u0027 said Uriah, writhing in a new way with pain. \u0027I\u0027ll be even with you.\u0027 \u0027Approach me again, you - you - you HEEP of infamy,\u0027 gasped Mr. Micawber, \u0027and if your head is human, I\u0027ll break it. Come on, come on! \u0027 I think I never saw anything more ridiculous - I was sensible of it, even at the time - than Mr. Micawber making broad-sword guards with the ruler, and crying, \u0027Come on!\u0027 while Traddles and I pushed him back into a corner, from which, as often as we got him into it, he persisted in emerging again. His enemy, muttering to himself, after wringing his wounded hand for sometime, slowly drew off his neck-kerchief and bound it up; then held it in his other hand, and sat upon his table with his sullen face looking down. Mr. Micawber, when he was sufficiently cool, proceeded with his letter. \u0027\"The stipendiary emoluments in consideration of which I entered into the service of - HEEP,\"\u0027 always pausing before that word and uttering it with astonishing vigour, \u0027\"were not defined, beyond the pittance of twenty-two shillings and six per week. The rest was left contingent on the value of my professional exertions; in other and more expressive words, on the baseness of my nature, the cupidity of my motives, the poverty of my family, the general moral (or rather immoral) resemblance between myself and - HEEP. Need I say, that it soon became necessary for me to solicit from - HEEP - pecuniary advances towards the support of Mrs. Micawber, and our blighted but rising family? Need I say that this necessity had been foreseen by - HEEP? That those advances were secured by I.O.U.\u0027s and other similar acknowledgements, known to the legal institutions of this country? And that I thus became immeshed in the web he had spun for my reception?\"\u0027 Mr. Micawber\u0027s enjoyment of his epistolary powers, in describing this unfortunate state of things, really seemed to outweigh any pain or anxiety that the reality could have caused him. He read on: \u0027\"Then it was that - HEEP - began to favour me with just so much of his confidence, as was necessary to the discharge of his infernal business. Then it was that I began, if I may so Shakespearianly express myself, to dwindle, peak, and pine. I found that my services were constantly called into requisition for the falsification of business, and the mystification of an individual whom I will designate as Mr. W. That Mr. W. was imposed upon, kept in ignorance, and deluded, in every possible way; yet, that all this while, the ruffian - HEEP - was professing unbounded gratitude to, and unbounded friendship for, that much-abused gentleman. This was bad enough; but, as the philosophic Dane observes, with that universal applicability which distinguishes the illustrious ornament of the Elizabethan Era, worse remains behind!\"\u0027 Mr. Micawber was so very much struck by this happy rounding off with a quotation, that he indulged himself, and us, with a second reading of the sentence, under pretence of having lost his place. \u0027\"It is not my intention,\"\u0027 he continued reading on, \u0027\"to enter on a detailed list, within the compass of the present epistle (though it is ready elsewhere), of the various malpractices of a minor nature, affecting the individual whom I have denominated Mr. W., to which I have been a tacitly consenting party. My object, when the contest within myself between stipend and no stipend, baker and no baker, existence and non-existence, ceased, was to take advantage of my opportunities to discover and expose the major malpractices committed, to that gentleman\u0027s grievous wrong and injury, by - HEEP. Stimulated by the silent monitor within, and by a no less touching and appealing monitor without - to whom I will briefly refer as Miss W. - I entered on a not unlaborious task of clandestine investigation, protracted - now, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, over a period exceeding twelve calendar months.\"\u0027 He read this passage as if it were from an Act of Parliament; and appeared majestically refreshed by the sound of the words. \u0027\"My charges against - HEEP,\"\u0027 he read on, glancing at him, and drawing the ruler into a convenient position under his left arm, in case of need, \u0027\"are as follows.\"\u0027 We all held our breath, I think. I am sure Uriah held his. \u0027\"First,\"\u0027 said Mr. Micawber, \u0027\"When Mr. W.\u0027s faculties and memory for business became, through causes into which it is not necessary or expedient for me to enter, weakened and confused, - HEEP - designedly perplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions. When Mr. W. was least fit to enter on business, - HEEP was always at hand to force him to enter on it. He obtained Mr. W.\u0027s signature under such circumstances to documents of importance, representing them to be other documents of no importance. He induced Mr. W. to empower him to draw out, thus, one particular sum of trust-money, amounting to twelve six fourteen, two and nine, and employed it to meet pretended business charges and deficiencies which were either already provided for, or had never really existed. He gave this proceeding, throughout, the appearance of having originated in Mr. W.\u0027s own dishonest intention, and of having been accomplished by Mr. W.\u0027s own dishonest act; and has used it, ever since, to torture and constrain him.\"\u0027 \u0027You shall prove this, you Copperfield!\u0027 said Uriah, with a threatening shake of the head. \u0027All in good time!\u0027 \u0027Ask - HEEP - Mr. Traddles, who lived in his house after him,\u0027 said Mr. Micawber, breaking off from the letter; \u0027will you?\u0027 \u0027The fool himself- and lives there now,\u0027 said Uriah, disdainfully. \u0027Ask - HEEP - if he ever kept a pocket-book in that house,\u0027 said Mr. Micawber; \u0027will you?\u0027 I saw Uriah\u0027s lank hand stop, involuntarily, in the scraping of his chin. \u0027Or ask him,\u0027 said Mr. Micawber,\u0027if he ever burnt one there. If he says yes, and asks you where the ashes are, refer him to Wilkins Micawber, and he will hear of something not at all to his advantage!\u0027 The triumphant flourish with which Mr. Micawber delivered himself of these words, had a powerful effect in alarming the mother; who cried out, in much agitation: \u0027Ury, Ury! Be umble, and make terms, my dear!\u0027 \u0027Mother!\u0027 he retorted, \u0027will you keep quiet? You\u0027re in a fright, and don\u0027t know what you say or mean. Umble!\u0027 he repeated, looking at me, with a snarl; \u0027I\u0027ve umbled some of \u0027em for a pretty long time back, umble as I was!\u0027 Mr. Micawber, genteelly adjusting his chin in his cravat, presently proceeded with his composition. \u0027\"Second. HEEP has, on several occasions, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief -\"\u0027 \u0027But that won\u0027t do,\u0027 muttered Uriah, relieved. \u0027Mother, you keep quiet.\u0027 \u0027We will endeavour to provide something that WILL do, and do for you finally, sir, very shortly,\u0027 replied Mr. Micawber. \u0027\"Second. HEEP has, on several occasions, to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief, systematically forged, to various entries, books, and documents, the signature of Mr. W.; and has distinctly done so in one instance, capable of proof by me. To wit, in manner following, that is to say:\"\u0027 Again, Mr. Micawber had a relish in this formal piling up of words, which, however ludicrously displayed in his case, was, I must say, not at all peculiar to him. I have observed it, in the course of my life, in numbers of men. It seems to me to be a general rule. In the taking of legal oaths, for instance, deponents seem to enjoy themselves mightily when they come to several good words in succession, for the expression of one idea; as, that they utterly detest, abominate, and abjure, or so forth; and the old anathemas were made relishing on the same principle. We talk about the tyranny of words, but we like to tyrannize over them too; we are fond of having a large superfluous establishment of words to wait upon us on great occasions; we think it looks important, and sounds well. As we are not particular about the meaning of our liveries on state occasions, if they be but fine and numerous enough, so, the meaning or necessity of our words is a secondary consideration, if there be but a great parade of them. And as individuals get into trouble by making too great a show of liveries, or as slaves when they are too numerous rise against their masters, so I think I could mention a nation that has got into many great difficulties, and will get into many greater, from maintaining too large a retinue of words. Mr. Micawber read on, almost smacking his lips: \u0027\"To wit, in manner following, that is to say. Mr. W. being infirm, and it being within the bounds of probability that his decease might lead to some discoveries, and to the downfall of - HEEP\u0027S - power over the W. family, - as I, Wilkins Micawber, the undersigned, assume - unless the filial affection of his daughter could be secretly influenced from allowing any investigation of the partnership affairs to be ever made, the said - HEEP - deemed it expedient to have a bond ready by him, as from Mr. W., for the before-mentioned sum of twelve six fourteen, two and nine, with interest, stated therein to have been advanced by - HEEP - to Mr. W. to save Mr. W. from dishonour; though really the sum was never advanced by him, and has long been replaced. The signatures to this instrument purporting to be executed by Mr. W. and attested by Wilkins Micawber, are forgeries by - HEEP. I have, in my possession, in his hand and pocket-book, several similar imitations of Mr. W.\u0027s signature, here and there defaced by fire, but legible to anyone. I never attested any such document. And I have the document itself, in my possession.\"\u0027 Uriah Heep, with a start, took out of his pocket a bunch of keys, and opened a certain drawer; then, suddenly bethought himself of what he was about, and turned again towards us, without looking in it. \u0027\"And I have the document,\"\u0027 Mr. Micawber read again, looking about as if it were the text of a sermon, \u0027\"in my possession, - that is to say, I had, early this morning, when this was written, but have since relinquished it to Mr. Traddles.\"\u0027 \u0027It is quite true,\u0027 assented Traddles. \u0027Ury, Ury!\u0027 cried the mother, \u0027be umble and make terms. I know my son will be umble, gentlemen, if you\u0027ll give him time to think. Mr. Copperfield, I\u0027m sure you know that he was always very umble, sir!\u0027 It was singular to see how the mother still held to the old trick, when the son had abandoned it as useless. \u0027Mother,\u0027 he said, with an impatient bite at the handkerchief in which his hand was wrapped, \u0027you had better take and fire a loaded gun at me.\u0027 \u0027But I love you, Ury,\u0027 cried Mrs. Heep. And I have no doubt she did; or that he loved her, however strange it may appear; though, to be sure, they were a congenial couple. \u0027And I can\u0027t bear to hear you provoking the gentlemen, and endangering of yourself more. I told the gentleman at first, when he told me upstairs it was come to light, that I would answer for your being umble, and making amends. Oh, see how umble I am, gentlemen, and don\u0027t mind him!\u0027 \u0027Why, there\u0027s Copperfield, mother,\u0027 he angrily retorted, pointing his lean finger at me, against whom all his animosity was levelled, as the prime mover in the discovery; and I did not undeceive him; \u0027there\u0027s Copperfield, would have given you a hundred pound to say less than you\u0027ve blurted out!\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t help it, Ury,\u0027 cried his mother. \u0027I can\u0027t see you running into danger, through carrying your head so high. Better be umble, as you always was.\u0027 He remained for a little, biting the handkerchief, and then said to me with a scowl: \u0027What more have you got to bring forward? If anything, go on with it. What do you look at me for?\u0027 Mr. Micawber promptly resumed his letter, glad to revert to a performance with which he was so highly satisfied. \u0027\"Third. And last. I am now in a condition to show, by - HEEP\u0027S - false books, and - HEEP\u0027S - real memoranda, beginning with the partially destroyed pocket-book (which I was unable to comprehend, at the time of its accidental discovery by Mrs. Micawber, on our taking possession of our present abode, in the locker or bin devoted to the reception of the ashes calcined on our domestic hearth), that the weaknesses, the faults, the very virtues, the parental affections, and the sense of honour, of the unhappy Mr. W. have been for years acted on by, and warped to the base purposes of - HEEP. That Mr. W. has been for years deluded and plundered, in every conceivable manner, to the pecuniary aggrandisement of the avaricious, false, and grasping - HEEP. That the engrossing object of- HEEP - was, next to gain, to subdue Mr. and Miss W. (of his ulterior views in reference to the latter I say nothing) entirely to himself. That his last act, completed but a few months since, was to induce Mr. W. to execute a relinquishment of his share in the partnership, and even a bill of sale on the very furniture of his house, in consideration of a certain annuity, to be well and truly paid by - HEEP - on the four common quarter-days in each and every year. That these meshes; beginning with alarming and falsified accounts of the estate of which Mr. W. is the receiver, at a period when Mr. W. had launched into imprudent and ill-judged speculations, and may not have had the money, for which he was morally and legally responsible, in hand; going on with pretended borrowings of money at enormous interest, really coming from - HEEP - and by - HEEP - fraudulently obtained or withheld from Mr. W. himself, on pretence of such speculations or otherwise; perpetuated by a miscellaneous catalogue of unscrupulous chicaneries - gradually thickened, until the unhappy Mr. W. could see no world beyond. Bankrupt, as he believed, alike in circumstances, in all other hope, and in honour, his sole reliance was upon the monster in the garb of man,\"\u0027 - Mr. Micawber made a good deal of this, as a new turn of expression, - \u0027\"who, by making himself necessary to him, had achieved his destruction. All this I undertake to show. Probably much more!\"\u0027 I whispered a few words to Agnes, who was weeping, half joyfully, half sorrowfully, at my side; and there was a movement among us, as if Mr. Micawber had finished. He said, with exceeding gravity, \u0027Pardon me,\u0027 and proceeded, with a mixture of the lowest spirits and the most intense enjoyment, to the peroration of his letter. \u0027\"I have now concluded. It merely remains for me to substantiate these accusations; and then, with my ill-starred family, to disappear from the landscape on which we appear to be an encumbrance. That is soon done. It may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first expire of inanition, as being the frailest member of our circle; and that our twins will follow next in order. So be it! For myself, my Canterbury Pilgrimage has done much; imprisonment on civil process, and want, will soon do more. I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation - of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together, in the pressure of arduous avocations, under grinding penurious apprehensions, at rise of morn, at dewy eve, in the shadows of night, under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon - combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it, when completed, to the right account, may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre. I ask no more. Let it be, in justice, merely said of me, as of a gallant and eminent naval Hero, with whom I have no pretensions to cope, that what I have done, I did, in despite of mercenary and selfish objects, For England, home, and Beauty. \u0027\"Remaining always, \u0026c. \u0026c., WILKINS MICAWBER.\"\u0027 Much affected, but still intensely enjoying himself, Mr. Micawber folded up his letter, and handed it with a bow to my aunt, as something she might like to keep. There was, as I had noticed on my first visit long ago, an iron safe in the room. The key was in it. A hasty suspicion seemed to strike Uriah; and, with a glance at Mr. Micawber, he went to it, and threw the doors clanking open. It was empty. \u0027Where are the books?\u0027 he cried, with a frightful face. \u0027Some thief has stolen the books!\u0027 Mr. Micawber tapped himself with the ruler. \u0027I did, when I got the key from you as usual - but a little earlier - and opened it this morning.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be uneasy,\u0027 said Traddles. \u0027They have come into my possession. I will take care of them, under the authority I mentioned.\u0027 \u0027You receive stolen goods, do you?\u0027 cried Uriah. \u0027Under such circumstances,\u0027 answered Traddles, \u0027yes.\u0027 What was my astonishment when I beheld my aunt, who had been profoundly quiet and attentive, make a dart at Uriah Heep, and seize him by the collar with both hands! \u0027You know what I want?\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027A strait-waistcoat,\u0027 said he. \u0027No. My property!\u0027 returned my aunt. \u0027Agnes, my dear, as long as I believed it had been really made away with by your father, I wouldn\u0027t - and, my dear, I didn\u0027t, even to Trot, as he knows - breathe a syllable of its having been placed here for investment. But, now I know this fellow\u0027s answerable for it, and I\u0027ll have it! Trot, come and take it away from him!\u0027 Whether my aunt supposed, for the moment, that he kept her property in his neck-kerchief, I am sure I don\u0027t know; but she certainly pulled at it as if she thought so. I hastened to put myself between them, and to assure her that we would all take care that he should make the utmost restitution of everything he had wrongly got. This, and a few moments\u0027 reflection, pacified her; but she was not at all disconcerted by what she had done (though I cannot say as much for her bonnet) and resumed her seat composedly. During the last few minutes, Mrs. Heep had been clamouring to her son to be \u0027umble\u0027; and had been going down on her knees to all of us in succession, and making the wildest promises. Her son sat her down in his chair; and, standing sulkily by her, holding her arm with his hand, but not rudely, said to me, with a ferocious look: \u0027What do you want done?\u0027 \u0027I will tell you what must be done,\u0027 said Traddles. \u0027Has that Copperfield no tongue?\u0027 muttered Uriah, \u0027I would do a good deal for you if you could tell me, without lying, that somebody had cut it out.\u0027 \u0027My Uriah means to be umble!\u0027 cried his mother. \u0027Don\u0027t mind what he says, good gentlemen!\u0027 \u0027What must be done,\u0027 said Traddles, \u0027is this. First, the deed of relinquishment, that we have heard of, must be given over to me now - here.\u0027 \u0027Suppose I haven\u0027t got it,\u0027 he interrupted. \u0027But you have,\u0027 said Traddles; \u0027therefore, you know, we won\u0027t suppose so.\u0027 And I cannot help avowing that this was the first occasion on which I really did justice to the clear head, and the plain, patient, practical good sense, of my old schoolfellow. \u0027Then,\u0027 said Traddles, \u0027you must prepare to disgorge all that your rapacity has become possessed of, and to make restoration to the last farthing. All the partnership books and papers must remain in our possession; all your books and papers; all money accounts and securities, of both kinds. In short, everything here.\u0027 \u0027Must it? I don\u0027t know that,\u0027 said Uriah. \u0027I must have time to think about that.\u0027 \u0027Certainly,\u0027 replied Traddles; \u0027but, in the meanwhile, and until everything is done to our satisfaction, we shall maintain possession of these things; and beg you - in short, compel you - to keep to your own room, and hold no communication with anyone.\u0027 \u0027I won\u0027t do it!\u0027 said Uriah, with an oath. \u0027Maidstone jail is a safer place of detention,\u0027 observed Traddles; \u0027and though the law may be longer in righting us, and may not be able to right us so completely as you can, there is no doubt of its punishing YOU. Dear me, you know that quite as well as I! Copperfield, will you go round to the Guildhall, and bring a couple of officers?\u0027 Here, Mrs. Heep broke out again, crying on her knees to Agnes to interfere in their behalf, exclaiming that he was very humble, and it was all true, and if he didn\u0027t do what we wanted, she would, and much more to the same purpose; being half frantic with fears for her darling. To inquire what he might have done, if he had had any boldness, would be like inquiring what a mongrel cur might do, if it had the spirit of a tiger. He was a coward, from head to foot; and showed his dastardly nature through his sullenness and mortification, as much as at any time of his mean life. \u0027Stop!\u0027 he growled to me; and wiped his hot face with his hand. \u0027Mother, hold your noise. Well! Let \u0027em have that deed. Go and fetch it!\u0027 \u0027Do you help her, Mr. Dick,\u0027 said Traddles, \u0027if you please.\u0027 Proud of his commission, and understanding it, Mr. Dick accompanied her as a shepherd\u0027s dog might accompany a sheep. But, Mrs. Heep gave him little trouble; for she not only returned with the deed, but with the box in which it was, where we found a banker\u0027s book and some other papers that were afterwards serviceable. \u0027Good!\u0027 said Traddles, when this was brought. \u0027Now, Mr. Heep, you can retire to think: particularly observing, if you please, that I declare to you, on the part of all present, that there is only one thing to be done; that it is what I have explained; and that it must be done without delay.\u0027 Uriah, without lifting his eyes from the ground, shuffled across the room with his hand to his chin, and pausing at the door, said: \u0027Copperfield, I have always hated you. You\u0027ve always been an upstart, and you\u0027ve always been against me.\u0027 \u0027As I think I told you once before,\u0027 said I, \u0027it is you who have been, in your greed and cunning, against all the world. It may be profitable to you to reflect, in future, that there never were greed and cunning in the world yet, that did not do too much, and overreach themselves. It is as certain as death.\u0027 \u0027Or as certain as they used to teach at school (the same school where I picked up so much umbleness), from nine o\u0027clock to eleven, that labour was a curse; and from eleven o\u0027clock to one, that it was a blessing and a cheerfulness, and a dignity, and I don\u0027t know what all, eh?\u0027 said he with a sneer. \u0027You preach, about as consistent as they did. Won\u0027t umbleness go down? I shouldn\u0027t have got round my gentleman fellow-partner without it, I think. - Micawber, you old bully, I\u0027ll pay YOU!\u0027 Mr. Micawber, supremely defiant of him and his extended finger, and making a great deal of his chest until he had slunk out at the door, then addressed himself to me, and proffered me the satisfaction of \u0027witnessing the re-establishment of mutual confidence between himself and Mrs. Micawber\u0027. After which, he invited the company generally to the contemplation of that affecting spectacle. \u0027The veil that has long been interposed between Mrs. Micawber and myself, is now withdrawn,\u0027 said Mr. Micawber; \u0027and my children and the Author of their Being can once more come in contact on equal terms.\u0027 As we were all very grateful to him, and all desirous to show that we were, as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit, I dare say we should all have gone, but that it was necessary for Agnes to return to her father, as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of hope; and for someone else to hold Uriah in safe keeping. So, Traddles remained for the latter purpose, to be presently relieved by Mr. Dick; and Mr. Dick, my aunt, and I, went home with Mr. Micawber. As I parted hurriedly from the dear girl to whom I owed so much, and thought from what she had been saved, perhaps, that morning - her better resolution notwithstanding - I felt devoutly thankful for the miseries of my younger days which had brought me to the knowledge of Mr. Micawber. His house was not far off; and as the street door opened into the sitting-room, and he bolted in with a precipitation quite his own, we found ourselves at once in the bosom of the family. Mr. Micawber exclaiming, \u0027Emma! my life!\u0027 rushed into Mrs. Micawber\u0027s arms. Mrs. Micawber shrieked, and folded Mr. Micawber in her embrace. Miss Micawber, nursing the unconscious stranger of Mrs. Micawber\u0027s last letter to me, was sensibly affected. The stranger leaped. The twins testified their joy by several inconvenient but innocent demonstrations. Master Micawber, whose disposition appeared to have been soured by early disappointment, and whose aspect had become morose, yielded to his better feelings, and blubbered. \u0027Emma!\u0027 said Mr. Micawber. \u0027The cloud is past from my mind. Mutual confidence, so long preserved between us once, is restored, to know no further interruption. Now, welcome poverty!\u0027 cried Mr. Micawber, shedding tears. \u0027Welcome misery, welcome houselessness, welcome hunger, rags, tempest, and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain us to the end!\u0027 With these expressions, Mr. Micawber placed Mrs. Micawber in a chair, and embraced the family all round; welcoming a variety of bleak prospects, which appeared, to the best of my judgement, to be anything but welcome to them; and calling upon them to come out into Canterbury and sing a chorus, as nothing else was left for their support. But Mrs. Micawber having, in the strength of her emotions, fainted away, the first thing to be done, even before the chorus could be considered complete, was to recover her. This my aunt and Mr. Micawber did; and then my aunt was introduced, and Mrs. Micawber recognized me. \u0027Excuse me, dear Mr. Copperfield,\u0027 said the poor lady, giving me her hand, \u0027but I am not strong; and the removal of the late misunderstanding between Mr. Micawber and myself was at first too much for me.\u0027 \u0027Is this all your family, ma\u0027am?\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027There are no more at present,\u0027 returned Mrs. Micawber. \u0027Good gracious, I didn\u0027t mean that, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027I mean, are all these yours?\u0027 \u0027Madam,\u0027 replied Mr. Micawber, \u0027it is a true bill.\u0027 \u0027And that eldest young gentleman, now,\u0027 said my aunt, musing, \u0027what has he been brought up to?\u0027 \u0027It was my hope when I came here,\u0027 said Mr. Micawber, \u0027to have got Wilkins into the Church: or perhaps I shall express my meaning more strictly, if I say the Choir. But there was no vacancy for a tenor in the venerable Pile for which this city is so justly eminent; and he has - in short, he has contracted a habit of singing in public-houses, rather than in sacred edifices.\u0027 \u0027But he means well,\u0027 said Mrs. Micawber, tenderly. \u0027I dare say, my love,\u0027 rejoined Mr. Micawber, \u0027that he means particularly well; but I have not yet found that he carries out his meaning, in any given direction whatsoever.\u0027 Master Micawber\u0027s moroseness of aspect returned upon him again, and he demanded, with some temper, what he was to do? Whether he had been born a carpenter, or a coach-painter, any more than he had been born a bird? Whether he could go into the next street, and open a chemist\u0027s shop? Whether he could rush to the next assizes, and proclaim himself a lawyer? Whether he could come out by force at the opera, and succeed by violence? Whether he could do anything, without being brought up to something? My aunt mused a little while, and then said: \u0027Mr. Micawber, I wonder you have never turned your thoughts to emigration.\u0027 \u0027Madam,\u0027 returned Mr. Micawber, \u0027it was the dream of my youth, and the fallacious aspiration of my riper years.\u0027 I am thoroughly persuaded, by the by, that he had never thought of it in his life. \u0027Aye?\u0027 said my aunt, with a glance at me. \u0027Why, what a thing it would be for yourselves and your family, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber, if you were to emigrate now.\u0027 \u0027Capital, madam, capital,\u0027 urged Mr. Micawber, gloomily. \u0027That is the principal, I may say the only difficulty, my dear Mr. Copperfield,\u0027 assented his wife. \u0027Capital?\u0027 cried my aunt. \u0027But you are doing us a great service - have done us a great service, I may say, for surely much will come out of the fire - and what could we do for you, that would be half so good as to find the capital?\u0027 \u0027I could not receive it as a gift,\u0027 said Mr. Micawber, full of fire and animation, \u0027but if a sufficient sum could be advanced, say at five per cent interest, per annum, upon my personal liability - say my notes of hand, at twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months, respectively, to allow time for something to turn up -\u0027 \u0027Could be? Can be and shall be, on your own terms,\u0027 returned my aunt, \u0027if you say the word. Think of this now, both of you. Here are some people David knows, going out to Australia shortly. If you decide to go, why shouldn\u0027t you go in the same ship? You may help each other. Think of this now, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber. Take your time, and weigh it well.\u0027 \u0027There is but one question, my dear ma\u0027am, I could wish to ask,\u0027 said Mrs. Micawber. \u0027The climate, I believe, is healthy?\u0027 \u0027Finest in the world!\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027Just so,\u0027 returned Mrs. Micawber. \u0027Then my question arises. Now, are the circumstances of the country such, that a man of Mr. Micawber\u0027s abilities would have a fair chance of rising in the social scale? I will not say, at present, might he aspire to be Governor, or anything of that sort; but would there be a reasonable opening for his talents to develop themselves - that would be amply sufficient - and find their own expansion?\u0027 \u0027No better opening anywhere,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027for a man who conducts himself well, and is industrious.\u0027 \u0027For a man who conducts himself well,\u0027 repeated Mrs. Micawber, with her clearest business manner, \u0027and is industrious.

Shall I ever recall that street of Canterbury on a market-day, without recalling him, as he walked back with us; expressing, in the hardy roving manner he assumed, the unsettled habits of a temporary sojourner in the land; and looking at the bullocks, as they came by, with the eye of an Australian farmer!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101/5379.html","bookId":208,"book":{"id":208,"title":"David Copperfield大卫·科波菲尔","description":"简介： David Copperfield or The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a novel in 185...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290216055bf31c.jpg","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM"}}
