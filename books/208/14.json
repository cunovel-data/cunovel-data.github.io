{"id":6424,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"On going down in the morning, I found my aunt musing so profoundly over the breakfast table, with her elbow on the tray, that the contents of the urn had overflowed the teapot and were laying the whole table-cloth under water, when my entrance put her meditations to flight. I felt sure that I had been the subject of her reflections, and was more than ever anxious to know her intentions towards me. Yet I dared not express my anxiety, lest it should give her offence. My eyes, however, not being so much under control as my tongue, were attracted towards my aunt very often during breakfast. I never could look at her for a few moments together but I found her looking at me - in an odd thoughtful manner, as if I were an immense way off, instead of being on the other side of the small round table. When she had finished her breakfast, my aunt very deliberately leaned back in her chair, knitted her brows, folded her arms, and contemplated me at her leisure, with such a fixedness of attention that I was quite overpowered by embarrassment. Not having as yet finished my own breakfast, I attempted to hide my confusion by proceeding with it; but my knife tumbled over my fork, my fork tripped up my knife, I chipped bits of bacon a surprising height into the air instead of cutting them for my own eating, and choked myself with my tea, which persisted in going the wrong way instead of the right one, until I gave in altogether, and sat blushing under my aunt\u0027s close scrutiny. \u0027Hallo!\u0027 said my aunt, after a long time. I looked up, and met her sharp bright glance respectfully. \u0027I have written to him,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027To -?\u0027 \u0027To your father-in-law,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027I have sent him a letter that I\u0027ll trouble him to attend to, or he and I will fall out, I can tell him!\u0027 \u0027Does he know where I am, aunt?\u0027 I inquired, alarmed. \u0027I have told him,\u0027 said my aunt, with a nod. \u0027Shall I - be - given up to him?\u0027 I faltered. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027We shall see.\u0027 \u0027Oh! I can\u0027t think what I shall do,\u0027 I exclaimed, \u0027if I have to go back to Mr. Murdstone!\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know anything about it,\u0027 said my aunt, shaking her head. \u0027I can\u0027t say, I am sure. We shall see.\u0027 My spirits sank under these words, and I became very downcast and heavy of heart. My aunt, without appearing to take much heed of me, put on a coarse apron with a bib, which she took out of the press; washed up the teacups with her own hands; and, when everything was washed and set in the tray again, and the cloth folded and put on the top of the whole, rang for Janet to remove it. She next swept up the crumbs with a little broom (putting on a pair of gloves first), until there did not appear to be one microscopic speck left on the carpet; next dusted and arranged the room, which was dusted and arranged to a hair\u0027sbreadth already. When all these tasks were performed to her satisfaction, she took off the gloves and apron, folded them up, put them in the particular corner of the press from which they had been taken, brought out her work-box to her own table in the open window, and sat down, with the green fan between her and the light, to work. \u0027I wish you\u0027d go upstairs,\u0027 said my aunt, as she threaded her needle, \u0027and give my compliments to Mr. Dick, and I\u0027ll be glad to know how he gets on with his Memorial.\u0027 I rose with all alacrity, to acquit myself of this commission. \u0027I suppose,\u0027 said my aunt, eyeing me as narrowly as she had eyed the needle in threading it, \u0027you think Mr. Dick a short name, eh?\u0027 \u0027I thought it was rather a short name, yesterday,\u0027 I confessed. \u0027You are not to suppose that he hasn\u0027t got a longer name, if he chose to use it,\u0027 said my aunt, with a loftier air. \u0027Babley - Mr. Richard Babley - that\u0027s the gentleman\u0027s true name.\u0027 I was going to suggest, with a modest sense of my youth and the familiarity I had been already guilty of, that I had better give him the full benefit of that name, when my aunt went on to say: \u0027But don\u0027t you call him by it, whatever you do. He can\u0027t bear his name. That\u0027s a peculiarity of his. Though I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s much of a peculiarity, either; for he has been ill-used enough, by some that bear it, to have a mortal antipathy for it, Heaven knows. Mr. Dick is his name here, and everywhere else, now - if he ever went anywhere else, which he don\u0027t. So take care, child, you don\u0027t call him anything BUT Mr. Dick.\u0027 I promised to obey, and went upstairs with my message; thinking, as I went, that if Mr. Dick had been working at his Memorial long, at the same rate as I had seen him working at it, through the open door, when I came down, he was probably getting on very well indeed. I found him still driving at it with a long pen, and his head almost laid upon the paper. He was so intent upon it, that I had ample leisure to observe the large paper kite in a corner, the confusion of bundles of manuscript, the number of pens, and, above all, the quantity of ink (which he seemed to have in, in half-gallon jars by the dozen), before he observed my being present. \u0027Ha! Phoebus!\u0027 said Mr. Dick, laying down his pen. \u0027How does the world go? I\u0027ll tell you what,\u0027 he added, in a lower tone, \u0027I shouldn\u0027t wish it to be mentioned, but it\u0027s a -\u0027 here he beckoned to me, and put his lips close to my ear - \u0027it\u0027s a mad world. Mad as Bedlam, boy!\u0027 said Mr. Dick, taking snuff from a round box on the table, and laughing heartily. Without presuming to give my opinion on this question, I delivered my message. \u0027Well,\u0027 said Mr. Dick, in answer, \u0027my compliments to her, and I - I believe I have made a start. I think I have made a start,\u0027 said Mr. Dick, passing his hand among his grey hair, and casting anything but a confident look at his manuscript. \u0027You have been to school?\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 I answered; \u0027for a short time.\u0027 \u0027Do you recollect the date,\u0027 said Mr. Dick, looking earnestly at me, and taking up his pen to note it down, \u0027when King Charles the First had his head cut off?\u0027 I said I believed it happened in the year sixteen hundred and forty-nine. \u0027Well,\u0027 returned Mr. Dick, scratching his ear with his pen, and looking dubiously at me. \u0027So the books say; but I don\u0027t see how that can be. Because, if it was so long ago, how could the people about him have made that mistake of putting some of the trouble out of his head, after it was taken off, into mine?\u0027 I was very much surprised by the inquiry; but could give no information on this point. \u0027It\u0027s very strange,\u0027 said Mr. Dick, with a despondent look upon his papers, and with his hand among his hair again, \u0027that I never can get that quite right. I never can make that perfectly clear. But no matter, no matter!\u0027 he said cheerfully, and rousing himself, \u0027there\u0027s time enough! My compliments to Miss Trotwood, I am getting on very well indeed.\u0027 I was going away, when he directed my attention to the kite. \u0027What do you think of that for a kite?\u0027 he said. I answered that it was a beautiful one. I should think it must have been as much as seven feet high. \u0027I made it. We\u0027ll go and fly it, you and I,\u0027 said Mr. Dick. \u0027Do you see this?\u0027 He showed me that it was covered with manuscript, very closely and laboriously written; but so plainly, that as I looked along the lines, I thought I saw some allusion to King Charles the First\u0027s head again, in one or two places. \u0027There\u0027s plenty of string,\u0027 said Mr. Dick, \u0027and when it flies high, it takes the facts a long way. That\u0027s my manner of diffusing \u0027em. I don\u0027t know where they may come down. It\u0027s according to circumstances, and the wind, and so forth; but I take my chance of that.\u0027 His face was so very mild and pleasant, and had something so reverend in it, though it was hale and hearty, that I was not sure but that he was having a good-humoured jest with me. So I laughed, and he laughed, and we parted the best friends possible. \u0027Well, child,\u0027 said my aunt, when I went downstairs. \u0027And what of Mr. Dick, this morning?\u0027 I informed her that he sent his compliments, and was getting on very well indeed. \u0027What do you think of him?\u0027 said my aunt. I had some shadowy idea of endeavouring to evade the question, by replying that I thought him a very nice gentleman; but my aunt was not to be so put off, for she laid her work down in her lap, and said, folding her hands upon it: \u0027Come! Your sister Betsey Trotwood would have told me what she thought of anyone, directly. Be as like your sister as you can, and speak out!\u0027 \u0027Is he - is Mr. Dick - I ask because I don\u0027t know, aunt - is he at all out of his mind, then?\u0027 I stammered; for I felt I was on dangerous ground. \u0027Not a morsel,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027Oh, indeed!\u0027 I observed faintly. \u0027If there is anything in the world,\u0027 said my aunt, with great decision and force of manner, \u0027that Mr. Dick is not, it\u0027s that.\u0027 I had nothing better to offer, than another timid, \u0027Oh, indeed!\u0027 \u0027He has been CALLED mad,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027I have a selfish pleasure in saying he has been called mad, or I should not have had the benefit of his society and advice for these last ten years and upwards - in fact, ever since your sister, Betsey Trotwood, disappointed me.\u0027 \u0027So long as that?\u0027 I said. \u0027And nice people they were, who had the audacity to call him mad,\u0027 pursued my aunt. \u0027Mr. Dick is a sort of distant connexion of mine - it doesn\u0027t matter how; I needn\u0027t enter into that. If it hadn\u0027t been for me, his own brother would have shut him up for life. That\u0027s all.\u0027 I am afraid it was hypocritical in me, but seeing that my aunt felt strongly on the subject, I tried to look as if I felt strongly too. \u0027A proud fool!\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027Because his brother was a little eccentric - though he is not half so eccentric as a good many people - he didn\u0027t like to have him visible about his house, and sent him away to some private asylum-place: though he had been left to his particular care by their deceased father, who thought him almost a natural. And a wise man he must have been to think so! Mad himself, no doubt.\u0027 Again, as my aunt looked quite convinced, I endeavoured to look quite convinced also. \u0027So I stepped in,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027and made him an offer. I said, \"Your brother\u0027s sane - a great deal more sane than you are, or ever will be, it is to be hoped. Let him have his little income, and come and live with me. I am not afraid of him, I am not proud, I am ready to take care of him, and shall not ill-treat him as some people (besides the asylum-folks) have done.\" After a good deal of squabbling,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027I got him; and he has been here ever since. He is the most friendly and amenable creature in existence; and as for advice! - But nobody knows what that man\u0027s mind is, except myself.\u0027 My aunt smoothed her dress and shook her head, as if she smoothed defiance of the whole world out of the one, and shook it out of the other. \u0027He had a favourite sister,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027a good creature, and very kind to him. But she did what they all do - took a husband. And HE did what they all do - made her wretched. It had such an effect upon the mind of Mr. Dick (that\u0027s not madness, I hope!) that, combined with his fear of his brother, and his sense of his unkindness, it threw him into a fever. That was before he came to me, but the recollection of it is oppressive to him even now. Did he say anything to you about King Charles the First, child?\u0027 \u0027Yes, aunt.\u0027 \u0027Ah!\u0027 said my aunt, rubbing her nose as if she were a little vexed. \u0027That\u0027s his allegorical way of expressing it. He connects his illness with great disturbance and agitation, naturally, and that\u0027s the figure, or the simile, or whatever it\u0027s called, which he chooses to use. And why shouldn\u0027t he, if he thinks proper!\u0027 I said: \u0027Certainly, aunt.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not a business-like way of speaking,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027nor a worldly way. I am aware of that; and that\u0027s the reason why I insist upon it, that there shan\u0027t be a word about it in his Memorial.\u0027 \u0027Is it a Memorial about his own history that he is writing, aunt?\u0027 \u0027Yes, child,\u0027 said my aunt, rubbing her nose again. \u0027He is memorializing the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord Somebody or other - one of those people, at all events, who are paid to be memorialized - about his affairs. I suppose it will go in, one of these days. He hasn\u0027t been able to draw it up yet, without introducing that mode of expressing himself; but it don\u0027t signify; it keeps him employed.\u0027 In fact, I found out afterwards that Mr. Dick had been for upwards of ten years endeavouring to keep King Charles the First out of the Memorial; but he had been constantly getting into it, and was there now. \u0027I say again,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027nobody knows what that man\u0027s mind is except myself; and he\u0027s the most amenable and friendly creature in existence. If he likes to fly a kite sometimes, what of that! Franklin used to fly a kite. He was a Quaker, or something of that sort, if I am not mistaken. And a Quaker flying a kite is a much more ridiculous object than anybody else.\u0027 If I could have supposed that my aunt had recounted these particulars for my especial behoof, and as a piece of confidence in me, I should have felt very much distinguished, and should have augured favourably from such a mark of her good opinion. But I could hardly help observing that she had launched into them, chiefly because the question was raised in her own mind, and with very little reference to me, though she had addressed herself to me in the absence of anybody else. At the same time, I must say that the generosity of her championship of poor harmless Mr. Dick, not only inspired my young breast with some selfish hope for myself, but warmed it unselfishly towards her. I believe that I began to know that there was something about my aunt, notwithstanding her many eccentricities and odd humours, to be honoured and trusted in. Though she was just as sharp that day as on the day before, and was in and out about the donkeys just as often, and was thrown into a tremendous state of indignation, when a young man, going by, ogled Janet at a window (which was one of the gravest misdemeanours that could be committed against my aunt\u0027s dignity), she seemed to me to command more of my respect, if not less of my fear. The anxiety I underwent, in the interval which necessarily elapsed before a reply could be received to her letter to Mr. Murdstone, was extreme; but I made an endeavour to suppress it, and to be as agreeable as I could in a quiet way, both to my aunt and Mr. Dick. The latter and I would have gone out to fly the great kite; but that I had still no other clothes than the anything but ornamental garments with which I had been decorated on the first day, and which confined me to the house, except for an hour after dark, when my aunt, for my health\u0027s sake, paraded me up and down on the cliff outside, before going to bed. At length the reply from Mr. Murdstone came, and my aunt informed me, to my infinite terror, that he was coming to speak to her herself on the next day. On the next day, still bundled up in my curious habiliments, I sat counting the time, flushed and heated by the conflict of sinking hopes and rising fears within me; and waiting to be startled by the sight of the gloomy face, whose non-arrival startled me every minute. MY aunt was a little more imperious and stern than usual, but I observed no other token of her preparing herself to receive the visitor so much dreaded by me. She sat at work in the window, and I sat by, with my thoughts running astray on all possible and impossible results of Mr. Murdstone\u0027s visit, until pretty late in the afternoon. Our dinner had been indefinitely postponed; but it was growing so late, that my aunt had ordered it to be got ready, when she gave a sudden alarm of donkeys, and to my consternation and amazement, I beheld Miss Murdstone, on a side-saddle, ride deliberately over the sacred piece of green, and stop in front of the house, looking about her. \u0027Go along with you!\u0027 cried my aunt, shaking her head and her fist at the window. \u0027You have no business there. How dare you trespass? Go along! Oh! you bold-faced thing!\u0027 MY aunt was so exasperated by the coolness with which Miss Murdstone looked about her, that I really believe she was motionless, and unable for the moment to dart out according to custom. I seized the opportunity to inform her who it was; and that the gentleman now coming near the offender (for the way up was very steep, and he had dropped behind), was Mr. Murdstone himself. \u0027I don\u0027t care who it is!\u0027 cried my aunt, still shaking her head and gesticulating anything but welcome from the bow-window. \u0027I won\u0027t be trespassed upon. I won\u0027t allow it. Go away! Janet, turn him round. Lead him off!\u0027 and I saw, from behind my aunt, a sort of hurried battle-piece, in which the donkey stood resisting everybody, with all his four legs planted different ways, while Janet tried to pull him round by the bridle, Mr. Murdstone tried to lead him on, Miss Murdstone struck at Janet with a parasol, and several boys, who had come to see the engagement, shouted vigorously. But my aunt, suddenly descrying among them the young malefactor who was the donkey\u0027s guardian, and who was one of the most inveterate offenders against her, though hardly in his teens, rushed out to the scene of action, pounced upon him, captured him, dragged him, with his jacket over his head, and his heels grinding the ground, into the garden, and, calling upon Janet to fetch the constables and justices, that he might be taken, tried, and executed on the spot, held him at bay there. This part of the business, however, did not last long; for the young rascal, being expert at a variety of feints and dodges, of which my aunt had no conception, soon went whooping away, leaving some deep impressions of his nailed boots in the flower-beds, and taking his donkey in triumph with him. Miss Murdstone, during the latter portion of the contest, had dismounted, and was now waiting with her brother at the bottom of the steps, until my aunt should be at leisure to receive them. My aunt, a little ruffled by the combat, marched past them into the house, with great dignity, and took no notice of their presence, until they were announced by Janet. \u0027Shall I go away, aunt?\u0027 I asked, trembling. \u0027No, sir,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027Certainly not!\u0027 With which she pushed me into a corner near her, and fenced Me in with a chair, as if it were a prison or a bar of justice. This position I continued to occupy during the whole interview, and from it I now saw Mr. and Miss Murdstone enter the room. \u0027Oh!\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027I was not aware at first to whom I had the pleasure of objecting. But I don\u0027t allow anybody to ride over that turf. I make no exceptions. I don\u0027t allow anybody to do it.\u0027 \u0027Your regulation is rather awkward to strangers,\u0027 said Miss Murdstone. \u0027Is it!\u0027 said my aunt. Mr. Murdstone seemed afraid of a renewal of hostilities, and interposing began: \u0027Miss Trotwood!\u0027 \u0027I beg your pardon,\u0027 observed my aunt with a keen look. \u0027You are the Mr. Murdstone who married the widow of my late nephew, David Copperfield, of Blunderstone Rookery! - Though why Rookery, I don\u0027t know!\u0027 \u0027I am,\u0027 said Mr. Murdstone. \u0027You\u0027ll excuse my saying, sir,\u0027 returned my aunt, \u0027that I think it would have been a much better and happier thing if you had left that poor child alone.\u0027 \u0027I so far agree with what Miss Trotwood has remarked,\u0027 observed Miss Murdstone, bridling, \u0027that I consider our lamented Clara to have been, in all essential respects, a mere child.\u0027 \u0027It is a comfort to you and me, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027who are getting on in life, and are not likely to be made unhappy by our personal attractions, that nobody can say the same of us.\u0027 \u0027No doubt!\u0027 returned Miss Murdstone, though, I thought, not with a very ready or gracious assent. \u0027And it certainly might have been, as you say, a better and happier thing for my brother if he had never entered into such a marriage. I have always been of that opinion.\u0027 \u0027I have no doubt you have,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027Janet,\u0027 ringing the bell, \u0027my compliments to Mr. Dick, and beg him to come down.\u0027 Until he came, my aunt sat perfectly upright and stiff, frowning at the wall. When he came, my aunt performed the ceremony of introduction. \u0027Mr. Dick. An old and intimate friend. On whose judgement,\u0027 said my aunt, with emphasis, as an admonition to Mr. Dick, who was biting his forefinger and looking rather foolish, \u0027I rely.\u0027 Mr. Dick took his finger out of his mouth, on this hint, and stood among the group, with a grave and attentive expression of face. My aunt inclined her head to Mr. Murdstone, who went on: \u0027Miss Trotwood: on the receipt of your letter, I considered it an act of greater justice to myself, and perhaps of more respect to you-\u0027 \u0027Thank you,\u0027 said my aunt, still eyeing him keenly. \u0027You needn\u0027t mind me.\u0027 \u0027To answer it in person, however inconvenient the journey,\u0027 pursued Mr. Murdstone, \u0027rather than by letter. This unhappy boy who has run away from his friends and his occupation -\u0027 \u0027And whose appearance,\u0027 interposed his sister, directing general attention to me in my indefinable costume, \u0027is perfectly scandalous and disgraceful.\u0027 \u0027Jane Murdstone,\u0027 said her brother, \u0027have the goodness not to interrupt me. This unhappy boy, Miss Trotwood, has been the occasion of much domestic trouble and uneasiness; both during the lifetime of my late dear wife, and since. He has a sullen, rebellious spirit; a violent temper; and an untoward, intractable disposition. Both my sister and myself have endeavoured to correct his vices, but ineffectually. And I have felt - we both have felt, I may say; my sister being fully in my confidence - that it is right you should receive this grave and dispassionate assurance from our lips.\u0027 \u0027It can hardly be necessary for me to confirm anything stated by my brother,\u0027 said Miss Murdstone; \u0027but I beg to observe, that, of all the boys in the world, I believe this is the worst boy.\u0027 \u0027Strong!\u0027 said my aunt, shortly. \u0027But not at all too strong for the facts,\u0027 returned Miss Murdstone. \u0027Ha!\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027Well, sir?\u0027 \u0027I have my own opinions,\u0027 resumed Mr. Murdstone, whose face darkened more and more, the more he and my aunt observed each other, which they did very narrowly, \u0027as to the best mode of bringing him up; they are founded, in part, on my knowledge of him, and in part on my knowledge of my own means and resources. I am responsible for them to myself, I act upon them, and I say no more about them. It is enough that I place this boy under the eye of a friend of my own, in a respectable business; that it does not please him; that he runs away from it; makes himself a common vagabond about the country; and comes here, in rags, to appeal to you, Miss Trotwood. I wish to set before you, honourably, the exact consequences - so far as they are within my knowledge - of your abetting him in this appeal.\u0027 \u0027But about the respectable business first,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027If he had been your own boy, you would have put him to it, just the same, I suppose?\u0027 \u0027If he had been my brother\u0027s own boy,\u0027 returned Miss Murdstone, striking in, \u0027his character, I trust, would have been altogether different.\u0027 \u0027Or if the poor child, his mother, had been alive, he would still have gone into the respectable business, would he?\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027I believe,\u0027 said Mr. Murdstone, with an inclination of his head, \u0027that Clara would have disputed nothing which myself and my sister Jane Murdstone were agreed was for the best.\u0027 Miss Murdstone confirmed this with an audible murmur. \u0027Humph!\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027Unfortunate baby!\u0027 Mr. Dick, who had been rattling his money all this time, was rattling it so loudly now, that my aunt felt it necessary to check him with a look, before saying: \u0027The poor child\u0027s annuity died with her?\u0027 \u0027Died with her,\u0027 replied Mr. Murdstone. \u0027And there was no settlement of the little property - the house and garden - the what\u0027s-its-name Rookery without any rooks in it - upon her boy?\u0027 \u0027It had been left to her, unconditionally, by her first husband,\u0027 Mr. Murdstone began, when my aunt caught him up with the greatest irascibility and impatience. \u0027Good Lord, man, there\u0027s no occasion to say that. Left to her unconditionally! I think I see David Copperfield looking forward to any condition of any sort or kind, though it stared him point-blank in the face! Of course it was left to her unconditionally. But when she married again - when she took that most disastrous step of marrying you, in short,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027to be plain - did no one put in a word for the boy at that time?\u0027 \u0027My late wife loved her second husband, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said Mr. Murdstone, \u0027and trusted implicitly in him.\u0027 \u0027Your late wife, sir, was a most unworldly, most unhappy, most unfortunate baby,\u0027 returned my aunt, shaking her head at him. \u0027That\u0027s what she was. And now, what have you got to say next?\u0027 \u0027Merely this, Miss Trotwood,\u0027 he returned. \u0027I am here to take David back - to take him back unconditionally, to dispose of him as I think proper, and to deal with him as I think right. I am not here to make any promise, or give any pledge to anybody. You may possibly have some idea, Miss Trotwood, of abetting him in his running away, and in his complaints to you. Your manner, which I must say does not seem intended to propitiate, induces me to think it possible. Now I must caution you that if you abet him once, you abet him for good and all; if you step in between him and me, now, you must step in, Miss Trotwood, for ever. I cannot trifle, or be trifled with. I am here, for the first and last time, to take him away. Is he ready to go? If he is not - and you tell me he is not; on any pretence; it is indifferent to me what - my doors are shut against him henceforth, and yours, I take it for granted, are open to him.\u0027 To this address, my aunt had listened with the closest attention, sitting perfectly upright, with her hands folded on one knee, and looking grimly on the speaker. When he had finished, she turned her eyes so as to command Miss Murdstone, without otherwise disturbing her attitude, and said: \u0027Well, ma\u0027am, have YOU got anything to remark?\u0027 \u0027Indeed, Miss Trotwood,\u0027 said Miss Murdstone, \u0027all that I could say has been so well said by my brother, and all that I know to be the fact has been so plainly stated by him, that I have nothing to add except my thanks for your politeness. For your very great politeness, I am sure,\u0027 said Miss Murdstone; with an irony which no more affected my aunt, than it discomposed the cannon I had slept by at Chatham. \u0027And what does the boy say?\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027Are you ready to go, David?\u0027 I answered no, and entreated her not to let me go. I said that neither Mr. nor Miss Murdstone had ever liked me, or had ever been kind to me. That they had made my mama, who always loved me dearly, unhappy about me, and that I knew it well, and that Peggotty knew it. I said that I had been more miserable than I thought anybody could believe, who only knew how young I was. And I begged and prayed my aunt - I forget in what terms now, but I remember that they affected me very much then - to befriend and protect me, for my father\u0027s sake. \u0027Mr. Dick,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027what shall I do with this child?\u0027 Mr. Dick considered, hesitated, brightened, and rejoined, \u0027Have him measured for a suit of clothes directly.\u0027 \u0027Mr. Dick,\u0027 said my aunt triumphantly, \u0027give me your hand, for your common sense is invaluable.\u0027 Having shaken it with great cordiality, she pulled me towards her and said to Mr. Murdstone: \u0027You can go when you like; I\u0027ll take my chance with the boy. If he\u0027s all you say he is, at least I can do as much for him then, as you have done. But I don\u0027t believe a word of it.\u0027 \u0027Miss Trotwood,\u0027 rejoined Mr. Murdstone, shrugging his shoulders, as he rose, \u0027if you were a gentleman -\u0027 \u0027Bah! Stuff and nonsense!\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027Don\u0027t talk to me!\u0027 \u0027How exquisitely polite!\u0027 exclaimed Miss Murdstone, rising. \u0027Overpowering, really!\u0027 \u0027Do you think I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said my aunt, turning a deaf ear to the sister, and continuing to address the brother, and to shake her head at him with infinite expression, \u0027what kind of life you must have led that poor, unhappy, misdirected baby? Do you think I don\u0027t know what a woeful day it was for the soft little creature when you first came in her way - smirking and making great eyes at her, I\u0027ll be bound, as if you couldn\u0027t say boh! to a goose!\u0027 \u0027I never heard anything so elegant!\u0027 said Miss Murdstone. \u0027Do you think I can\u0027t understand you as well as if I had seen you,\u0027 pursued my aunt, \u0027now that I DO see and hear you - which, I tell you candidly, is anything but a pleasure to me? Oh yes, bless us! who so smooth and silky as Mr. Murdstone at first! The poor, benighted innocent had never seen such a man. He was made of sweetness. He worshipped her. He doted on her boy - tenderly doted on him! He was to be another father to him, and they were all to live together in a garden of roses, weren\u0027t they? Ugh! Get along with you, do!\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027I never heard anything like this person in my life!\u0027 exclaimed Miss Murdstone. \u0027And when you had made sure of the poor little fool,\u0027 said my aunt - \u0027God forgive me that I should call her so, and she gone where YOU won\u0027t go in a hurry - because you had not done wrong enough to her and hers, you must begin to train her, must you? begin to break her, like a poor caged bird, and wear her deluded life away, in teaching her to sing YOUR notes?\u0027 \u0027This is either insanity or intoxication,\u0027 said Miss Murdstone, in a perfect agony at not being able to turn the current of my aunt\u0027s address towards herself; \u0027and my suspicion is that it\u0027s intoxication.\u0027 Miss Betsey, without taking the least notice of the interruption, continued to address herself to Mr. Murdstone as if there had been no such thing. \u0027Mr. Murdstone,\u0027 she said, shaking her finger at him, \u0027you were a tyrant to the simple baby, and you broke her heart. She was a loving baby - I know that; I knew it, years before you ever saw her - and through the best part of her weakness you gave her the wounds she died of. There is the truth for your comfort, however you like it. And you and your instruments may make the most of it.\u0027 \u0027Allow me to inquire, Miss Trotwood,\u0027 interposed Miss Murdstone, \u0027whom you are pleased to call, in a choice of words in which I am not experienced, my brother\u0027s instruments?\u0027 \u0027It was clear enough, as I have told you, years before YOU ever saw her - and why, in the mysterious dispensations of Providence, you ever did see her, is more than humanity can comprehend - it was clear enough that the poor soft little thing would marry somebody, at some time or other; but I did hope it wouldn\u0027t have been as bad as it has turned out. That was the time, Mr. Murdstone, when she gave birth to her boy here,\u0027 said my aunt; \u0027to the poor child you sometimes tormented her through afterwards, which is a disagreeable remembrance and makes the sight of him odious now. Aye, aye! you needn\u0027t wince!\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027I know it\u0027s true without that.\u0027 He had stood by the door, all this while, observant of her with a smile upon his face, though his black eyebrows were heavily contracted. I remarked now, that, though the smile was on his face still, his colour had gone in a moment, and he seemed to breathe as if he had been running. \u0027Good day, sir,\u0027 said my aunt, \u0027and good-bye! Good day to you, too, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said my aunt, turning suddenly upon his sister. \u0027Let me see you ride a donkey over my green again, and as sure as you have a head upon your shoulders, I\u0027ll knock your bonnet off, and tread upon it!\u0027 It would require a painter, and no common painter too, to depict my aunt\u0027s face as she delivered herself of this very unexpected sentiment, and Miss Murdstone\u0027s face as she heard it. But the manner of the speech, no less than the matter, was so fiery, that Miss Murdstone, without a word in answer, discreetly put her arm through her brother\u0027s, and walked haughtily out of the cottage; my aunt remaining in the window looking after them; prepared, I have no doubt, in case of the donkey\u0027s reappearance, to carry her threat into instant execution. No attempt at defiance being made, however, her face gradually relaxed, and became so pleasant, that I was emboldened to kiss and thank her; which I did with great heartiness, and with both my arms clasped round her neck. I then shook hands with Mr. Dick, who shook hands with me a great many times, and hailed this happy close of the proceedings with repeated bursts of laughter. \u0027You\u0027ll consider yourself guardian, jointly with me, of this child, Mr. Dick,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027I shall be delighted,\u0027 said Mr. Dick, \u0027to be the guardian of David\u0027s son.\u0027 \u0027Very good,\u0027 returned my aunt, \u0027that\u0027s settled. I have been thinking, do you know, Mr. Dick, that I might call him Trotwood?\u0027 \u0027Certainly, certainly. Call him Trotwood, certainly,\u0027 said Mr. Dick. \u0027David\u0027s son\u0027s Trotwood.\u0027 \u0027Trotwood Copperfield, you mean,\u0027 returned my aunt. \u0027Yes, to be sure. Yes. Trotwood Copperfield,\u0027 said Mr. Dick, a little abashed. My aunt took so kindly to the notion, that some ready-made clothes, which were purchased for me that afternoon, were marked \u0027Trotwood Copperfield\u0027, in her own handwriting, and in indelible marking-ink, before I put them on; and it was settled that all the other clothes which were ordered to be made for me (a complete outfit was bespoke that afternoon) should be marked in the same way. Thus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me. Now that the state of doubt was over, I felt, for many days, like one in a dream. I never thought that I had a curious couple of guardians, in my aunt and Mr. Dick. I never thought of anything about myself, distinctly. The two things clearest in my mind were, that a remoteness had come upon the old Blunderstone life - which seemed to lie in the haze of an immeasurable distance; and that a curtain had for ever fallen on my life at Murdstone and Grinby\u0027s. No one has ever raised that curtain since. I have lifted it for a moment, even in this narrative, with a reluctant hand, and dropped it gladly. The remembrance of that life is fraught with so much pain to me, with so much mental suffering and want of hope, that I have never had the courage even to examine how long I was doomed to lead it. Whether it lasted for a year, or more, or less, I do not know. I only know that it was, and ceased to be; and that I have written, and there I leave it.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101/5341.html","bookId":208,"book":{"id":208,"title":"David Copperfield大卫·科波菲尔","description":"简介： David Copperfield or The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a novel in 185...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290216055bf31c.jpg","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM"}}
