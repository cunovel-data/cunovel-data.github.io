{"id":6451,"no":41,"title":"Chapter 41","content":"At last, an answer came from the two old ladies. They presented their compliments to Mr. Copperfield, and informed him that they had given his letter their best consideration, \u0027with a view to the happiness of both parties\u0027 - which I thought rather an alarming expression, not only because of the use they had made of it in relation to the family difference before-mentioned, but because I had (and have all my life) observed that conventional phrases are a sort of fireworks, easily let off, and liable to take a great variety of shapes and colours not at all suggested by their original form. The Misses Spenlow added that they begged to forbear expressing, \u0027through the medium of correspondence\u0027, an opinion on the subject of Mr. Copperfield\u0027s communication; but that if Mr. Copperfield would do them the favour to call, upon a certain day (accompanied, if he thought proper, by a confidential friend), they would be happy to hold some conversation on the subject. \\n\\n To this favour, Mr. Copperfield immediately replied, with his respectful compliments, that he would have the honour of waiting on the Misses Spenlow, at the time appointed; accompanied, in accordance with their kind permission, by his friend Mr. Thomas Traddles of the Inner Temple. Having dispatched which missive, Mr. Copperfield fell into a condition of strong nervous agitation; and so remained until the day arrived. \\n\\n It was a great augmentation of my uneasiness to be bereaved, at this eventful crisis, of the inestimable services of Miss Mills. But Mr. Mills, who was always doing something or other to annoy me - or I felt as if he were, which was the same thing - had brought his conduct to a climax, by taking it into his head that he would go to India. Why should he go to India, except to harass me? To be sure he had nothing to do with any other part of the world, and had a good deal to do with that part; being entirely in the India trade, whatever that was (I had floating dreams myself concerning golden shawls and elephants\u0027 teeth); having been at Calcutta in his youth; and designing now to go out there again, in the capacity of resident partner. But this was nothing to me. However, it was so much to him that for India he was bound, and Julia with him; and Julia went into the country to take leave of her relations; and the house was put into a perfect suit of bills, announcing that it was to be let or sold, and that the furniture (Mangle and all) was to be taken at a valuation. So, here was another earthquake of which I became the sport, before I had recovered from the shock of its predecessor! \\n\\n I was in several minds how to dress myself on the important day; being divided between my desire to appear to advantage, and my apprehensions of putting on anything that might impair my severely practical character in the eyes of the Misses Spenlow. I endeavoured to hit a happy medium between these two extremes; my aunt approved the result; and Mr. Dick threw one of his shoes after Traddles and me, for luck, as we went downstairs. \\n\\n Excellent fellow as I knew Traddles to be, and warmly attached to him as I was, I could not help wishing, on that delicate occasion, that he had never contracted the habit of brushing his hair so very upright. It gave him a surprised look - not to say a hearth-broomy kind of expression - which, my apprehensions whispered, might be fatal to us. \\n\\n I took the liberty of mentioning it to Traddles, as we were walking to Putney; and saying that if he WOULD smooth it down a little - \\n\\n \u0027My dear Copperfield,\u0027 said Traddles, lifting off his hat, and rubbing his hair all kinds of ways, \u0027nothing would give me greater pleasure. But it won\u0027t.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Won\u0027t be smoothed down?\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Traddles. \u0027Nothing will induce it. If I was to carry a half-hundred-weight upon it, all the way to Putney, it would be up again the moment the weight was taken off. You have no idea what obstinate hair mine is, Copperfield. I am quite a fretful porcupine.\u0027 \\n\\n I was a little disappointed, I must confess, but thoroughly charmed by his good-nature too. I told him how I esteemed his good-nature; and said that his hair must have taken all the obstinacy out of his character, for he had none. \\n\\n \u0027Oh!\u0027 returned Traddles, laughing. \u0027I assure you, it\u0027s quite an old story, my unfortunate hair. My uncle\u0027s wife couldn\u0027t bear it. She said it exasperated her. It stood very much in my way, too, when I first fell in love with Sophy. Very much!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Did she object to it?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027SHE didn\u0027t,\u0027 rejoined Traddles; \u0027but her eldest sister - the one that\u0027s the Beauty - quite made game of it, I understand. In fact, all the sisters laugh at it.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Agreeable!\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 returned Traddles with perfect innocence, \u0027it\u0027s a joke for us. They pretend that Sophy has a lock of it in her desk, and is obliged to shut it in a clasped book, to keep it down. We laugh about it.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027By the by, my dear Traddles,\u0027 said I, \u0027your experience may suggest something to me. When you became engaged to the young lady whom you have just mentioned, did you make a regular proposal to her family? Was there anything like - what we are going through today, for instance?\u0027 I added, nervously. \\n\\n \u0027Why,\u0027 replied Traddles, on whose attentive face a thoughtful shade had stolen, \u0027it was rather a painful transaction, Copperfield, in my case. You see, Sophy being of so much use in the family, none of them could endure the thought of her ever being married. Indeed, they had quite settled among themselves that she never was to be married, and they called her the old maid. Accordingly, when I mentioned it, with the greatest precaution, to Mrs. Crewler -\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027The mama?\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027The mama,\u0027 said Traddles - \u0027Reverend Horace Crewler - when I mentioned it with every possible precaution to Mrs. Crewler, the effect upon her was such that she gave a scream and became insensible. I couldn\u0027t approach the subject again, for months.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You did at last?\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027Well, the Reverend Horace did,\u0027 said Traddles. \u0027He is an excellent man, most exemplary in every way; and he pointed out to her that she ought, as a Christian, to reconcile herself to the sacrifice (especially as it was so uncertain), and to bear no uncharitable feeling towards me. As to myself, Copperfield, I give you my word, I felt a perfect bird of prey towards the family.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027The sisters took your part, I hope, Traddles?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Why, I can\u0027t say they did,\u0027 he returned. \u0027When we had comparatively reconciled Mrs. Crewler to it, we had to break it to Sarah. You recollect my mentioning Sarah, as the one that has something the matter with her spine?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Perfectly!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027She clenched both her hands,\u0027 said Traddles, looking at me in dismay; \u0027shut her eyes; turned lead-colour; became perfectly stiff; and took nothing for two days but toast-and-water, administered with a tea-spoon.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What a very unpleasant girl, Traddles!\u0027 I remarked. \\n\\n \u0027Oh, I beg your pardon, Copperfield!\u0027 said Traddles. \u0027She is a very charming girl, but she has a great deal of feeling. In fact, they all have. Sophy told me afterwards, that the self-reproach she underwent while she was in attendance upon Sarah, no words could describe. I know it must have been severe, by my own feelings, Copperfield; which were like a criminal\u0027s. After Sarah was restored, we still had to break it to the other eight; and it produced various effects upon them of a most pathetic nature. The two little ones, whom Sophy educates, have only just left off de-testing me.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027At any rate, they are all reconciled to it now, I hope?\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027Ye-yes, I should say they were, on the whole, resigned to it,\u0027 said Traddles, doubtfully. \u0027The fact is, we avoid mentioning the subject; and my unsettled prospects and indifferent circumstances are a great consolation to them. There will be a deplorable scene, whenever we are married. It will be much more like a funeral, than a wedding. And they\u0027ll all hate me for taking her away!\u0027 \\n\\n His honest face, as he looked at me with a serio-comic shake of his head, impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality, for I was by this time in a state of such excessive trepidation and wandering of mind, as to be quite unable to fix my attention on anything. On our approaching the house where the Misses Spenlow lived, I was at such a discount in respect of my personal looks and presence of mind, that Traddles proposed a gentle stimulant in the form of a glass of ale. This having been administered at a neighbouring public-house, he conducted me, with tottering steps, to the Misses Spenlow\u0027s door. \\n\\n I had a vague sensation of being, as it were, on view, when the maid opened it; and of wavering, somehow, across a hall with a weather-glass in it, into a quiet little drawing-room on the ground-floor, commanding a neat garden. Also of sitting down here, on a sofa, and seeing Traddles\u0027s hair start up, now his hat was removed, like one of those obtrusive little figures made of springs, that fly out of fictitious snuff-boxes when the lid is taken off. Also of hearing an old-fashioned clock ticking away on the chimney-piece, and trying to make it keep time to the jerking of my heart, - which it wouldn\u0027t. Also of looking round the room for any sign of Dora, and seeing none. Also of thinking that Jip once barked in the distance, and was instantly choked by somebody. Ultimately I found myself backing Traddles into the fireplace, and bowing in great confusion to two dry little elderly ladies, dressed in black, and each looking wonderfully like a preparation in chip or tan of the late Mr. Spenlow. \\n\\n \u0027Pray,\u0027 said one of the two little ladies, \u0027be seated.\u0027 \\n\\n When I had done tumbling over Traddles, and had sat upon something which was not a cat - my first seat was - I so far recovered my sight, as to perceive that Mr. Spenlow had evidently been the youngest of the family; that there was a disparity of six or eight years between the two sisters; and that the younger appeared to be the manager of the conference, inasmuch as she had my letter in her hand - so familiar as it looked to me, and yet so odd! - and was referring to it through an eye-glass. They were dressed alike, but this sister wore her dress with a more youthful air than the other; and perhaps had a trifle more frill, or tucker, or brooch, or bracelet, or some little thing of that kind, which made her look more lively. They were both upright in their carriage, formal, precise, composed, and quiet. The sister who had not my letter, had her arms crossed on her breast, and resting on each other, like an Idol. \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Copperfield, I believe,\u0027 said the sister who had got my letter, addressing herself to Traddles. \\n\\n This was a frightful beginning. Traddles had to indicate that I was Mr. Copperfield, and I had to lay claim to myself, and they had to divest themselves of a preconceived opinion that Traddles was Mr. Copperfield, and altogether we were in a nice condition. To improve it, we all distinctly heard Jip give two short barks, and receive another choke. \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Copperfield!\u0027 said the sister with the letter. \\n\\n I did something - bowed, I suppose - and was all attention, when the other sister struck in. \\n\\n \u0027My sister Lavinia,\u0027 said she \u0027being conversant with matters of this nature, will state what we consider most calculated to promote the happiness of both parties.\u0027 \\n\\n I discovered afterwards that Miss Lavinia was an authority in affairs of the heart, by reason of there having anciently existed a certain Mr. Pidger, who played short whist, and was supposed to have been enamoured of her. My private opinion is, that this was entirely a gratuitous assumption, and that Pidger was altogether innocent of any such sentiments - to which he had never given any sort of expression that I could ever hear of. Both Miss Lavinia and Miss Clarissa had a superstition, however, that he would have declared his passion, if he had not been cut short in his youth (at about sixty) by over-drinking his constitution, and over-doing an attempt to set it right again by swilling Bath water. They had a lurking suspicion even, that he died of secret love; though I must say there was a picture of him in the house with a damask nose, which concealment did not appear to have ever preyed upon. \\n\\n \u0027We will not,\u0027 said Miss Lavinia, \u0027enter on the past history of this matter. Our poor brother Francis\u0027s death has cancelled that.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027We had not,\u0027 said Miss Clarissa, \u0027been in the habit of frequent association with our brother Francis; but there was no decided division or disunion between us. Francis took his road; we took ours. We considered it conducive to the happiness of all parties that it should be so. And it was so.\u0027 \\n\\n Each of the sisters leaned a little forward to speak, shook her head after speaking, and became upright again when silent. Miss Clarissa never moved her arms. She sometimes played tunes upon them with her fingers - minuets and marches I should think - but never moved them. \\n\\n \u0027Our niece\u0027s position, or supposed position, is much changed by our brother Francis\u0027s death,\u0027 said Miss Lavinia; \u0027and therefore we consider our brother\u0027s opinions as regarded her position as being changed too. We have no reason to doubt, Mr. Copperfield, that you are a young gentleman possessed of good qualities and honourable character; or that you have an affection - or are fully persuaded that you have an affection - for our niece.\u0027 \\n\\n I replied, as I usually did whenever I had a chance, that nobody had ever loved anybody else as I loved Dora. Traddles came to my assistance with a confirmatory murmur. \\n\\n Miss Lavinia was going on to make some rejoinder, when Miss Clarissa, who appeared to be incessantly beset by a desire to refer to her brother Francis, struck in again: \\n\\n \u0027If Dora\u0027s mama,\u0027 she said, \u0027when she married our brother Francis, had at once said that there was not room for the family at the dinner-table, it would have been better for the happiness of all parties.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Sister Clarissa,\u0027 said Miss Lavinia. \u0027Perhaps we needn\u0027t mind that now.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Sister Lavinia,\u0027 said Miss Clarissa, \u0027it belongs to the subject. With your branch of the subject, on which alone you are competent to speak, I should not think of interfering. On this branch of the subject I have a voice and an opinion. It would have been better for the happiness of all parties, if Dora\u0027s mama, when she married our brother Francis, had mentioned plainly what her intentions were. We should then have known what we had to expect. We should have said \"Pray do not invite us, at any time\"; and all possibility of misunderstanding would have been avoided.\u0027 \\n\\n When Miss Clarissa had shaken her head, Miss Lavinia resumed: again referring to my letter through her eye-glass. They both had little bright round twinkling eyes, by the way, which were like birds\u0027 eyes. They were not unlike birds, altogether; having a sharp, brisk, sudden manner, and a little short, spruce way of adjusting themselves, like canaries. \\n\\n Miss Lavinia, as I have said, resumed: \\n\\n \u0027You ask permission of my sister Clarissa and myself, Mr. Copperfield, to visit here, as the accepted suitor of our niece.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027If our brother Francis,\u0027 said Miss Clarissa, breaking out again, if I may call anything so calm a breaking out, \u0027wished to surround himself with an atmosphere of Doctors\u0027 Commons, and of Doctors\u0027 Commons only, what right or desire had we to object? None, I am sure. We have ever been far from wishing to obtrude ourselves on anyone. But why not say so? Let our brother Francis and his wife have their society. Let my sister Lavinia and myself have our society. We can find it for ourselves, I hope.\u0027 \\n\\n As this appeared to be addressed to Traddles and me, both Traddles and I made some sort of reply. Traddles was inaudible. I think I observed, myself, that it was highly creditable to all concerned. I don\u0027t in the least know what I meant. \\n\\n \u0027Sister Lavinia,\u0027 said Miss Clarissa, having now relieved her mind, \u0027you can go on, my dear.\u0027 \\n\\n Miss Lavinia proceeded: \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Copperfield, my sister Clarissa and I have been very careful indeed in considering this letter; and we have not considered it without finally showing it to our niece, and discussing it with our niece. We have no doubt that you think you like her very much.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Think, ma\u0027am,\u0027 I rapturously began, \u0027oh! -\u0027 \\n\\n But Miss Clarissa giving me a look (just like a sharp canary), as requesting that I would not interrupt the oracle, I begged pardon. \\n\\n \u0027Affection,\u0027 said Miss Lavinia, glancing at her sister for corroboration, which she gave in the form of a little nod to every clause, \u0027mature affection, homage, devotion, does not easily express itself. Its voice is low. It is modest and retiring, it lies in ambush, waits and waits. Such is the mature fruit. Sometimes a life glides away, and finds it still ripening in the shade.\u0027 \\n\\n Of course I did not understand then that this was an allusion to her supposed experience of the stricken Pidger; but I saw, from the gravity with which Miss Clarissa nodded her head, that great weight was attached to these words. \\n\\n \u0027The light - for I call them, in comparison with such sentiments, the light - inclinations of very young people,\u0027 pursued Miss Lavinia, \u0027are dust, compared to rocks. It is owing to the difficulty of knowing whether they are likely to endure or have any real foundation, that my sister Clarissa and myself have been very undecided how to act, Mr. Copperfield, and Mr. -\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Traddles,\u0027 said my friend, finding himself looked at. \\n\\n \u0027I beg pardon. Of the Inner Temple, I believe?\u0027 said Miss Clarissa, again glancing at my letter. \\n\\n Traddles said \u0027Exactly so,\u0027 and became pretty red in the face. \\n\\n Now, although I had not received any express encouragement as yet, I fancied that I saw in the two little sisters, and particularly in Miss Lavinia, an intensified enjoyment of this new and fruitful subject of domestic interest, a settling down to make the most of it, a disposition to pet it, in which there was a good bright ray of hope. I thought I perceived that Miss Lavinia would have uncommon satisfaction in superintending two young lovers, like Dora and me; and that Miss Clarissa would have hardly less satisfaction in seeing her superintend us, and in chiming in with her own particular department of the subject whenever that impulse was strong upon her. This gave me courage to protest most vehemently that I loved Dora better than I could tell, or anyone believe; that all my friends knew how I loved her; that my aunt, Agnes, Traddles, everyone who knew me, knew how I loved her, and how earnest my love had made me. For the truth of this, I appealed to Traddles. And Traddles, firing up as if he were plunging into a Parliamentary Debate, really did come out nobly: confirming me in good round terms, and in a plain sensible practical manner, that evidently made a favourable impression. \\n\\n \u0027I speak, if I may presume to say so, as one who has some little experience of such things,\u0027 said Traddles, \u0027being myself engaged to a young lady - one of ten, down in Devonshire - and seeing no probability, at present, of our engagement coming to a termination.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You may be able to confirm what I have said, Mr. Traddles,\u0027 observed Miss Lavinia, evidently taking a new interest in him, \u0027of the affection that is modest and retiring; that waits and waits?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Entirely, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said Traddles. \\n\\n Miss Clarissa looked at Miss Lavinia, and shook her head gravely. Miss Lavinia looked consciously at Miss Clarissa, and heaved a little sigh. \u0027Sister Lavinia,\u0027 said Miss Clarissa, \u0027take my smelling-bottle.\u0027 \\n\\n Miss Lavinia revived herself with a few whiffs of aromatic vinegar - Traddles and I looking on with great solicitude the while; and then went on to say, rather faintly: \\n\\n \u0027My sister and myself have been in great doubt, Mr. Traddles, what course we ought to take in reference to the likings, or imaginary likings, of such very young people as your friend Mr. Copperfield and our niece.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Our brother Francis\u0027s child,\u0027 remarked Miss Clarissa. \u0027If our brother Francis\u0027s wife had found it convenient in her lifetime (though she had an unquestionable right to act as she thought best) to invite the family to her dinner-table, we might have known our brother Francis\u0027s child better at the present moment. Sister Lavinia, proceed.\u0027 \\n\\n Miss Lavinia turned my letter, so as to bring the superscription towards herself, and referred through her eye-glass to some orderly-looking notes she had made on that part of it. \\n\\n \u0027It seems to us,\u0027 said she, \u0027prudent, Mr. Traddles, to bring these feelings to the test of our own observation. At present we know nothing of them, and are not in a situation to judge how much reality there may be in them. Therefore we are inclined so far to accede to Mr. Copperfield\u0027s proposal, as to admit his visits here.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I shall never, dear ladies,\u0027 I exclaimed, relieved of an immense load of apprehension, \u0027forget your kindness!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027But,\u0027 pursued Miss Lavinia, - \u0027but, we would prefer to regard those visits, Mr. Traddles, as made, at present, to us. We must guard ourselves from recognizing any positive engagement between Mr. Copperfield and our niece, until we have had an opportunity -\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Until YOU have had an opportunity, sister Lavinia,\u0027 said Miss Clarissa. \\n\\n \u0027Be it so,\u0027 assented Miss Lavinia, with a sigh - \u0027until I have had an opportunity of observing them.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Copperfield,\u0027 said Traddles, turning to me, \u0027you feel, I am sure, that nothing could be more reasonable or considerate.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Nothing!\u0027 cried I. \u0027I am deeply sensible of it.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027In this position of affairs,\u0027 said Miss Lavinia, again referring to her notes, \u0027and admitting his visits on this understanding only, we must require from Mr. Copperfield a distinct assurance, on his word of honour, that no communication of any kind shall take place between him and our niece without our knowledge. That no project whatever shall be entertained with regard to our niece, without being first submitted to us -\u0027 \u0027To you, sister Lavinia,\u0027 Miss Clarissa interposed. \\n\\n \u0027Be it so, Clarissa!\u0027 assented Miss Lavinia resignedly - \u0027to me - and receiving our concurrence. We must make this a most express and serious stipulation, not to be broken on any account. We wished Mr. Copperfield to be accompanied by some confidential friend today,\u0027 with an inclination of her head towards Traddles, who bowed, \u0027in order that there might be no doubt or misconception on this subject. If Mr. Copperfield, or if you, Mr. Traddles, feel the least scruple, in giving this promise, I beg you to take time to consider it.\u0027 \\n\\n I exclaimed, in a state of high ecstatic fervour, that not a moment\u0027s consideration could be necessary. I bound myself by the required promise, in a most impassioned manner; called upon Traddles to witness it; and denounced myself as the most atrocious of characters if I ever swerved from it in the least degree. \\n\\n \u0027Stay!\u0027 said Miss Lavinia, holding up her hand; \u0027we resolved, before we had the pleasure of receiving you two gentlemen, to leave you alone for a quarter of an hour, to consider this point. You will allow us to retire.\u0027 \\n\\n It was in vain for me to say that no consideration was necessary. They persisted in withdrawing for the specified time. Accordingly, these little birds hopped out with great dignity; leaving me to receive the congratulations of Traddles, and to feel as if I were translated to regions of exquisite happiness. Exactly at the expiration of the quarter of an hour, they reappeared with no less dignity than they had disappeared. They had gone rustling away as if their little dresses were made of autumn-leaves: and they came rustling back, in like manner. \\n\\n I then bound myself once more to the prescribed conditions. \\n\\n \u0027Sister Clarissa,\u0027 said Miss Lavinia, \u0027the rest is with you.\u0027 \\n\\n Miss Clarissa, unfolding her arms for the first time, took the notes and glanced at them. \\n\\n \u0027We shall be happy,\u0027 said Miss Clarissa, \u0027to see Mr. Copperfield to dinner, every Sunday, if it should suit his convenience. Our hour is three.\u0027 \\n\\n I bowed. \\n\\n \u0027In the course of the week,\u0027 said Miss Clarissa, \u0027we shall be happy to see Mr. Copperfield to tea. Our hour is half-past six.\u0027 \\n\\n I bowed again. \\n\\n \u0027Twice in the week,\u0027 said Miss Clarissa, \u0027but, as a rule, not oftener.\u0027 \\n\\n I bowed again. \\n\\n \u0027Miss Trotwood,\u0027 said Miss Clarissa, \u0027mentioned in Mr. Copperfield\u0027s letter, will perhaps call upon us. When visiting is better for the happiness of all parties, we are glad to receive visits, and return them. When it is better for the happiness of all parties that no visiting should take place, (as in the case of our brother Francis, and his establishment) that is quite different.\u0027 \\n\\n I intimated that my aunt would be proud and delighted to make their acquaintance; though I must say I was not quite sure of their getting on very satisfactorily together. The conditions being now closed, I expressed my acknowledgements in the warmest manner; and, taking the hand, first of Miss Clarissa, and then of Miss Lavinia, pressed it, in each case, to my lips. \\n\\n Miss Lavinia then arose, and begging Mr. Traddles to excuse us for a minute, requested me to follow her. I obeyed, all in a tremble, and was conducted into another room. There I found my blessed darling stopping her ears behind the door, with her dear little face against the wall; and Jip in the plate-warmer with his head tied up in a towel. \\n\\n Oh! How beautiful she was in her black frock, and how she sobbed and cried at first, and wouldn\u0027t come out from behind the door! How fond we were of one another, when she did come out at last; and what a state of bliss I was in, when we took Jip out of the plate-warmer, and restored him to the light, sneezing very much, and were all three reunited! \\n\\n \u0027My dearest Dora! Now, indeed, my own for ever!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh, DON\u0027T!\u0027 pleaded Dora. \u0027Please!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Are you not my own for ever, Dora?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh yes, of course I am!\u0027 cried Dora, \u0027but I am so frightened!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Frightened, my own?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh yes! I don\u0027t like him,\u0027 said Dora. \u0027Why don\u0027t he go?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Who, my life?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Your friend,\u0027 said Dora. \u0027It isn\u0027t any business of his. What a stupid he must be!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027My love!\u0027 (There never was anything so coaxing as her childish ways.) \u0027He is the best creature!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh, but we don\u0027t want any best creatures!\u0027 pouted Dora. \\n\\n \u0027My dear,\u0027 I argued, \u0027you will soon know him well, and like him of all things. And here is my aunt coming soon; and you\u0027ll like her of all things too, when you know her.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No, please don\u0027t bring her!\u0027 said Dora, giving me a horrified little kiss, and folding her hands. \u0027Don\u0027t. I know she\u0027s a naughty, mischief-making old thing! Don\u0027t let her come here, Doady!\u0027 which was a corruption of David. \\n\\n Remonstrance was of no use, then; so I laughed, and admired, and was very much in love and very happy; and she showed me Jip\u0027s new trick of standing on his hind legs in a corner - which he did for about the space of a flash of lightning, and then fell down - and I don\u0027t know how long I should have stayed there, oblivious of Traddles, if Miss Lavinia had not come in to take me away. Miss Lavinia was very fond of Dora (she told me Dora was exactly like what she had been herself at her age - she must have altered a good deal), and she treated Dora just as if she had been a toy. I wanted to persuade Dora to come and see Traddles, but on my proposing it she ran off to her own room and locked herself in; so I went to Traddles without her, and walked away with him on air. \\n\\n \u0027Nothing could be more satisfactory,\u0027 said Traddles; \u0027and they are very agreeable old ladies, I am sure. I shouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if you were to be married years before me, Copperfield.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Does your Sophy play on any instrument, Traddles?\u0027 I inquired, in the pride of my heart. \\n\\n \u0027She knows enough of the piano to teach it to her little sisters,\u0027 said Traddles. \\n\\n \u0027Does she sing at all?\u0027 I asked. \\n\\n \u0027Why, she sings ballads, sometimes, to freshen up the others a little when they\u0027re out of spirits,\u0027 said Traddles. \u0027Nothing scientific.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027She doesn\u0027t sing to the guitar?\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027Oh dear no!\u0027 said Traddles. \\n\\n \u0027Paint at all?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Not at all,\u0027 said Traddles. \\n\\n I promised Traddles that he should hear Dora sing, and see some of her flower-painting. He said he should like it very much, and we went home arm in arm in great good humour and delight. I encouraged him to talk about Sophy, on the way; which he did with a loving reliance on her that I very much admired. I compared her in my mind with Dora, with considerable inward satisfaction; but I candidly admitted to myself that she seemed to be an excellent kind of girl for Traddles, too. \\n\\n Of course my aunt was immediately made acquainted with the successful issue of the conference, and with all that had been said and done in the course of it. She was happy to see me so happy, and promised to call on Dora\u0027s aunts without loss of time. But she took such a long walk up and down our rooms that night, while I was writing to Agnes, that I began to think she meant to walk till morning. \\n\\n My letter to Agnes was a fervent and grateful one, narrating all the good effects that had resulted from my following her advice. She wrote, by return of post, to me. Her letter was hopeful, earnest, and cheerful. She was always cheerful from that time. \\n\\n I had my hands more full than ever, now. My daily journeys to Highgate considered, Putney was a long way off; and I naturally wanted to go there as often as I could. The proposed tea-drinkings being quite impracticable, I compounded with Miss Lavinia for permission to visit every Saturday afternoon, without detriment to my privileged Sundays. So, the close of every week was a delicious time for me; and I got through the rest of the week by looking forward to it. \\n\\n I was wonderfully relieved to find that my aunt and Dora\u0027s aunts rubbed on, all things considered, much more smoothly than I could have expected. My aunt made her promised visit within a few days of the conference; and within a few more days, Dora\u0027s aunts called upon her, in due state and form. Similar but more friendly exchanges took place afterwards, usually at intervals of three or four weeks. I know that my aunt distressed Dora\u0027s aunts very much, by utterly setting at naught the dignity of fly-conveyance, and walking out to Putney at extraordinary times, as shortly after breakfast or just before tea; likewise by wearing her bonnet in any manner that happened to be comfortable to her head, without at all deferring to the prejudices of civilization on that subject. But Dora\u0027s aunts soon agreed to regard my aunt as an eccentric and somewhat masculine lady, with a strong understanding; and although my aunt occasionally ruffled the feathers of Dora\u0027s aunts, by expressing heretical opinions on various points of ceremony, she loved me too well not to sacrifice some of her little peculiarities to the general harmony. \\n\\n The only member of our small society who positively refused to adapt himself to circumstances, was Jip. He never saw my aunt without immediately displaying every tooth in his head, retiring under a chair, and growling incessantly: with now and then a doleful howl, as if she really were too much for his feelings. All kinds of treatment were tried with him, coaxing, scolding, slapping, bringing him to Buckingham Street (where he instantly dashed at the two cats, to the terror of all beholders); but he never could prevail upon himself to bear my aunt\u0027s society. He would sometimes think he had got the better of his objection, and be amiable for a few minutes; and then would put up his snub nose, and howl to that extent, that there was nothing for it but to blind him and put him in the plate-warmer. At length, Dora regularly muffled him in a towel and shut him up there, whenever my aunt was reported at the door. \\n\\n One thing troubled me much, after we had fallen into this quiet train. It was, that Dora seemed by one consent to be regarded like a pretty toy or plaything. My aunt, with whom she gradually became familiar, always called her Little Blossom; and the pleasure of Miss Lavinia\u0027s life was to wait upon her, curl her hair, make ornaments for her, and treat her like a pet child. What Miss Lavinia did, her sister did as a matter of course. It was very odd to me; but they all seemed to treat Dora, in her degree, much as Dora treated Jip in his. \\n\\n I made up my mind to speak to Dora about this; and one day when we were out walking (for we were licensed by Miss Lavinia, after a while, to go out walking by ourselves), I said to her that I wished she could get them to behave towards her differently. \\n\\n \u0027Because you know, my darling,\u0027 I remonstrated, \u0027you are not a child.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027There!\u0027 said Dora. \u0027Now you\u0027re going to be cross!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Cross, my love?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I am sure they\u0027re very kind to me,\u0027 said Dora, \u0027and I am very happy -\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well! But my dearest life!\u0027 said I, \u0027you might be very happy, and yet be treated rationally.\u0027 \\n\\n Dora gave me a reproachful look - the prettiest look! - and then began to sob, saying, if I didn\u0027t like her, why had I ever wanted so much to be engaged to her? And why didn\u0027t I go away, now, if I couldn\u0027t bear her? \\n\\n What could I do, but kiss away her tears, and tell her how I doted on her, after that! \\n\\n \u0027I am sure I am very affectionate,\u0027 said Dora; \u0027you oughtn\u0027t to be cruel to me, Doady!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Cruel, my precious love! As if I would - or could - be cruel to you, for the world!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Then don\u0027t find fault with me,\u0027 said Dora, making a rosebud of her mouth; \u0027and I\u0027ll be good.\u0027 \\n\\n I was charmed by her presently asking me, of her own accord, to give her that cookery-book I had once spoken of, and to show her how to keep accounts as I had once promised I would. I brought the volume with me on my next visit (I got it prettily bound, first, to make it look less dry and more inviting); and as we strolled about the Common, I showed her an old housekeeping-book of my aunt\u0027s, and gave her a set of tablets, and a pretty little pencil-case and box of leads, to practise housekeeping with. \\n\\n But the cookery-book made Dora\u0027s head ache, and the figures made her cry. They wouldn\u0027t add up, she said. So she rubbed them out, and drew little nosegays and likenesses of me and Jip, all over the tablets. \\n\\n Then I playfully tried verbal instruction in domestic matters, as we walked about on a Saturday afternoon. Sometimes, for example, when we passed a butcher\u0027s shop, I would say: \\n\\n \u0027Now suppose, my pet, that we were married, and you were going to buy a shoulder of mutton for dinner, would you know how to buy it?\u0027 \\n\\n My pretty little Dora\u0027s face would fall, and she would make her mouth into a bud again, as if she would very much prefer to shut mine with a kiss. \\n\\n \u0027Would you know how to buy it, my darling?\u0027 I would repeat, perhaps, if I were very inflexible. \\n\\n Dora would think a little, and then reply, perhaps, with great triumph: \\n\\n \u0027Why, the butcher would know how to sell it, and what need I know? Oh, you silly boy!\u0027 \\n\\n So, when I once asked Dora, with an eye to the cookery-book, what she would do, if we were married, and I were to say I should like a nice Irish stew, she replied that she would tell the servant to make it; and then clapped her little hands together across my arm, and laughed in such a charming manner that she was more delightful than ever. \\n\\n Consequently, the principal use to which the cookery-book was devoted, was being put down in the corner for Jip to stand upon. But Dora was so pleased, when she had trained him to stand upon it without offering to come off, and at the same time to hold the pencil-case in his mouth, that I was very glad I had bought it. \\n\\n And we fell back on the guitar-case, and the flower-painting, and the songs about never leaving off dancing, Ta ra la! and were as happy as the week was long. I occasionally wished I could venture to hint to Miss Lavinia, that she treated the darling of my heart a little too much like a plaything; and I sometimes awoke, as it were, wondering to find that I had fallen into the general fault, and treated her like a plaything too - but not often.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101/5368.html","bookId":208,"book":{"id":208,"title":"David Copperfield大卫·科波菲尔","description":"简介： David Copperfield or The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a novel in 185...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290216055bf31c.jpg","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM"}}
