{"id":6441,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 31","content":"It was not difficult for me, on Peggotty\u0027s solicitation, to resolve to stay where I was, until after the remains of the poor carrier should have made their last journey to Blunderstone. She had long ago bought, out of her own savings, a little piece of ground in our old churchyard near the grave of \u0027her sweet girl\u0027, as she always called my mother; and there they were to rest. In keeping Peggotty company, and doing all I could for her (little enough at the utmost), I was as grateful, I rejoice to think, as even now I could wish myself to have been. But I am afraid I had a supreme satisfaction, of a personal and professional nature, in taking charge of Mr. Barkis\u0027s will, and expounding its contents. I may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will should be looked for in the box. After some search, it was found in the box, at the bottom of a horse\u0027s nose-bag; wherein (besides hay) there was discovered an old gold watch, with chain and seals, which Mr. Barkis had worn on his wedding-day, and which had never been seen before or since; a silver tobacco-stopper, in the form of a leg; an imitation lemon, full of minute cups and saucers, which I have some idea Mr. Barkis must have purchased to present to me when I was a child, and afterwards found himself unable to part with; eighty-seven guineas and a half, in guineas and half-guineas; two hundred and ten pounds, in perfectly clean Bank notes; certain receipts for Bank of England stock; an old horseshoe, a bad shilling, a piece of camphor, and an oyster-shell. From the circumstance of the latter article having been much polished, and displaying prismatic colours on the inside, I conclude that Mr. Barkis had some general ideas about pearls, which never resolved themselves into anything definite. For years and years, Mr. Barkis had carried this box, on all his journeys, every day. That it might the better escape notice, he had invented a fiction that it belonged to \u0027Mr. Blackboy\u0027, and was \u0027to be left with Barkis till called for\u0027; a fable he had elaborately written on the lid, in characters now scarcely legible. He had hoarded, all these years, I found, to good purpose. His property in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds. Of this he bequeathed the interest of one thousand to Mr. Peggotty for his life; on his decease, the principal to be equally divided between Peggotty, little Emily, and me, or the survivor or survivors of us, share and share alike. All the rest he died possessed of, he bequeathed to Peggotty; whom he left residuary legatee, and sole executrix of that his last will and testament. I felt myself quite a proctor when I read this document aloud with all possible ceremony, and set forth its provisions, any number of times, to those whom they concerned. I began to think there was more in the Commons than I had supposed. I examined the will with the deepest attention, pronounced it perfectly formal in all respects, made a pencil-mark or so in the margin, and thought it rather extraordinary that I knew so much. In this abstruse pursuit; in making an account for Peggotty, of all the property into which she had come; in arranging all the affairs in an orderly manner; and in being her referee and adviser on every point, to our joint delight; I passed the week before the funeral. I did not see little Emily in that interval, but they told me she was to be quietly married in a fortnight. I did not attend the funeral in character, if I may venture to say so. I mean I was not dressed up in a black coat and a streamer, to frighten the birds; but I walked over to Blunderstone early in the morning, and was in the churchyard when it came, attended only by Peggotty and her brother. The mad gentleman looked on, out of my little window; Mr. Chillip\u0027s baby wagged its heavy head, and rolled its goggle eyes, at the clergyman, over its nurse\u0027s shoulder; Mr. Omer breathed short in the background; no one else was there; and it was very quiet. We walked about the churchyard for an hour, after all was over; and pulled some young leaves from the tree above my mother\u0027s grave. A dread falls on me here. A cloud is lowering on the distant town, towards which I retraced my solitary steps. I fear to approach it. I cannot bear to think of what did come, upon that memorable night; of what must come again, if I go on. It is no worse, because I write of it. It would be no better, if I stopped my most unwilling hand. It is done. Nothing can undo it; nothing can make it otherwise than as it was. My old nurse was to go to London with me next day, on the business of the will. Little Emily was passing that day at Mr. Omer\u0027s. We were all to meet in the old boathouse that night. Ham would bring Emily at the usual hour. I would walk back at my leisure. The brother and sister would return as they had come, and be expecting us, when the day closed in, at the fireside. I parted from them at the wicket-gate, where visionary Strap had rested with Roderick Random\u0027s knapsack in the days of yore; and, instead of going straight back, walked a little distance on the road to Lowestoft. Then I turned, and walked back towards Yarmouth. I stayed to dine at a decent alehouse, some mile or two from the Ferry I have mentioned before; and thus the day wore away, and it was evening when I reached it. Rain was falling heavily by that time, and it was a wild night; but there was a moon behind the clouds, and it was not dark. I was soon within sight of Mr. Peggotty\u0027s house, and of the light within it shining through the window. A little floundering across the sand, which was heavy, brought me to the door, and I went in. It looked very comfortable indeed. Mr. Peggotty had smoked his evening pipe and there were preparations for some supper by and by. The fire was bright, the ashes were thrown up, the locker was ready for little Emily in her old place. In her own old place sat Peggotty, once more, looking (but for her dress) as if she had never left it. She had fallen back, already, on the society of the work-box with St. Paul\u0027s upon the lid, the yard-measure in the cottage, and the bit of wax-candle; and there they all were, just as if they had never been disturbed. Mrs. Gummidge appeared to be fretting a little, in her old corner; and consequently looked quite natural, too. \u0027You\u0027re first of the lot, Mas\u0027r Davy!\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty with a happy face. \u0027Doen\u0027t keep in that coat, sir, if it\u0027s wet.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, Mr. Peggotty,\u0027 said I, giving him my outer coat to hang up. \u0027It\u0027s quite dry.\u0027 \u0027So \u0027tis!\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, feeling my shoulders. \u0027As a chip! Sit ye down, sir. It ain\u0027t o\u0027 no use saying welcome to you, but you\u0027re welcome, kind and hearty.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, Mr. Peggotty, I am sure of that. Well, Peggotty!\u0027 said I, giving her a kiss. \u0027And how are you, old woman?\u0027 \u0027Ha, ha!\u0027 laughed Mr. Peggotty, sitting down beside us, and rubbing his hands in his sense of relief from recent trouble, and in the genuine heartiness of his nature; \u0027there\u0027s not a woman in the wureld, sir - as I tell her - that need to feel more easy in her mind than her! She done her dooty by the departed, and the departed know\u0027d it; and the departed done what was right by her, as she done what was right by the departed; - and - and - and it\u0027s all right!\u0027 Mrs. Gummidge groaned. \u0027Cheer up, my pritty mawther!\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty. (But he shook his head aside at us, evidently sensible of the tendency of the late occurrences to recall the memory of the old one.) \u0027Doen\u0027t be down! Cheer up, for your own self, on\u0027y a little bit, and see if a good deal more doen\u0027t come nat\u0027ral!\u0027 \u0027Not to me, Dan\u0027l,\u0027 returned Mrs. Gummidge. \u0027Nothink\u0027s nat\u0027ral to me but to be lone and lorn.\u0027 \u0027No, no,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, soothing her sorrows. \u0027Yes, yes, Dan\u0027l!\u0027 said Mrs. Gummidge. \u0027I ain\u0027t a person to live with them as has had money left. Thinks go too contrary with me. I had better be a riddance.\u0027 \u0027Why, how should I ever spend it without you?\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, with an air of serious remonstrance. \u0027What are you a talking on? Doen\u0027t I want you more now, than ever I did?\u0027 \u0027I know\u0027d I was never wanted before!\u0027 cried Mrs. Gummidge, with a pitiable whimper, \u0027and now I\u0027m told so! How could I expect to be wanted, being so lone and lorn, and so contrary!\u0027 Mr. Peggotty seemed very much shocked at himself for having made a speech capable of this unfeeling construction, but was prevented from replying, by Peggotty\u0027s pulling his sleeve, and shaking her head. After looking at Mrs. Gummidge for some moments, in sore distress of mind, he glanced at the Dutch clock, rose, snuffed the candle, and put it in the window. \u0027Theer!\u0027said Mr. Peggotty, cheerily.\u0027Theer we are, Missis Gummidge!\u0027 Mrs. Gummidge slightly groaned. \u0027Lighted up, accordin\u0027 to custom! You\u0027re a wonderin\u0027 what that\u0027s fur, sir! Well, it\u0027s fur our little Em\u0027ly. You see, the path ain\u0027t over light or cheerful arter dark; and when I\u0027m here at the hour as she\u0027s a comin\u0027 home, I puts the light in the winder. That, you see,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, bending over me with great glee, \u0027meets two objects. She says, says Em\u0027ly, \"Theer\u0027s home!\" she says. And likewise, says Em\u0027ly, \"My uncle\u0027s theer!\" Fur if I ain\u0027t theer, I never have no light showed.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re a baby!\u0027 said Peggotty; very fond of him for it, if she thought so. \u0027Well,\u0027 returned Mr. Peggotty, standing with his legs pretty wide apart, and rubbing his hands up and down them in his comfortable satisfaction, as he looked alternately at us and at the fire. \u0027I doen\u0027t know but I am. Not, you see, to look at.\u0027 \u0027Not azackly,\u0027 observed Peggotty. \u0027No,\u0027 laughed Mr. Peggotty, \u0027not to look at, but to - to consider on, you know. I doen\u0027t care, bless you! Now I tell you. When I go a looking and looking about that theer pritty house of our Em\u0027ly\u0027s, I\u0027m - I\u0027m Gormed,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, with sudden emphasis - \u0027theer! I can\u0027t say more - if I doen\u0027t feel as if the littlest things was her, a\u0027most. I takes \u0027em up and I put \u0027em down, and I touches of \u0027em as delicate as if they was our Em\u0027ly. So \u0027tis with her little bonnets and that. I couldn\u0027t see one on \u0027em rough used a purpose - not fur the whole wureld. There\u0027s a babby fur you, in the form of a great Sea Porkypine!\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, relieving his earnestness with a roar of laughter. Peggotty and I both laughed, but not so loud. \u0027It\u0027s my opinion, you see,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, with a delighted face, after some further rubbing of his legs, \u0027as this is along of my havin\u0027 played with her so much, and made believe as we was Turks, and French, and sharks, and every wariety of forinners - bless you, yes; and lions and whales, and I doen\u0027t know what all! - when she warn\u0027t no higher than my knee. I\u0027ve got into the way on it, you know. Why, this here candle, now!\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, gleefully holding out his hand towards it, \u0027I know wery well that arter she\u0027s married and gone, I shall put that candle theer, just the same as now. I know wery well that when I\u0027m here o\u0027 nights (and where else should I live, bless your arts, whatever fortun\u0027 I come into!) and she ain\u0027t here or I ain\u0027t theer, I shall put the candle in the winder, and sit afore the fire, pretending I\u0027m expecting of her, like I\u0027m a doing now. THERE\u0027S a babby for you,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, with another roar, \u0027in the form of a Sea Porkypine! Why, at the present minute, when I see the candle sparkle up, I says to myself, \"She\u0027s a looking at it! Em\u0027ly\u0027s a coming!\" THERE\u0027S a babby for you, in the form of a Sea Porkypine! Right for all that,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, stopping in his roar, and smiting his hands together; \u0027fur here she is!\u0027 It was only Ham. The night should have turned more wet since I came in, for he had a large sou\u0027wester hat on, slouched over his face. \u0027Wheer\u0027s Em\u0027ly?\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty. Ham made a motion with his head, as if she were outside. Mr. Peggotty took the light from the window, trimmed it, put it on the table, and was busily stirring the fire, when Ham, who had not moved, said: \u0027Mas\u0027r Davy, will you come out a minute, and see what Em\u0027ly and me has got to show you?\u0027 We went out. As I passed him at the door, I saw, to my astonishment and fright, that he was deadly pale. He pushed me hastily into the open air, and closed the door upon us. Only upon us two. \u0027Ham! what\u0027s the matter?\u0027 \u0027Mas\u0027r Davy! -\u0027 Oh, for his broken heart, how dreadfully he wept! I was paralysed by the sight of such grief. I don\u0027t know what I thought, or what I dreaded. I could only look at him. \u0027Ham! Poor good fellow! For Heaven\u0027s sake, tell me what\u0027s the matter!\u0027 \u0027My love, Mas\u0027r Davy - the pride and hope of my art - her that I\u0027d have died for, and would die for now - she\u0027s gone!\u0027 \u0027Gone!\u0027 \u0027Em\u0027ly\u0027s run away! Oh, Mas\u0027r Davy, think HOW she\u0027s run away, when I pray my good and gracious God to kill her (her that is so dear above all things) sooner than let her come to ruin and disgrace!\u0027 The face he turned up to the troubled sky, the quivering of his clasped hands, the agony of his figure, remain associated with the lonely waste, in my remembrance, to this hour. It is always night there, and he is the only object in the scene. \u0027You\u0027re a scholar,\u0027 he said, hurriedly, \u0027and know what\u0027s right and best. What am I to say, indoors? How am I ever to break it to him, Mas\u0027r Davy?\u0027 I saw the door move, and instinctively tried to hold the latch on the outside, to gain a moment\u0027s time. It was too late. Mr. Peggotty thrust forth his face; and never could I forget the change that came upon it when he saw us, if I were to live five hundred years. I remember a great wail and cry, and the women hanging about him, and we all standing in the room; I with a paper in my hand, which Ham had given me; Mr. Peggotty, with his vest torn open, his hair wild, his face and lips quite white, and blood trickling down his bosom (it had sprung from his mouth, I think), looking fixedly at me. \u0027Read it, sir,\u0027 he said, in a low shivering voice. \u0027Slow, please. I doen\u0027t know as I can understand.\u0027 In the midst of the silence of death, I read thus, from a blotted letter: \u0027\"When you, who love me so much better than I ever have deserved, even when my mind was innocent, see this, I shall be far away.\"\u0027 \u0027I shall be fur away,\u0027 he repeated slowly. \u0027Stop! Em\u0027ly fur away. Well!\u0027 \u0027\"When I leave my dear home - my dear home - oh, my dear home! - in the morning,\"\u0027 the letter bore date on the previous night: \u0027\"- it will be never to come back, unless he brings me back a lady. This will be found at night, many hours after, instead of me. Oh, if you knew how my heart is torn. If even you, that I have wronged so much, that never can forgive me, could only know what I suffer! I am too wicked to write about myself! Oh, take comfort in thinking that I am so bad. Oh, for mercy\u0027s sake, tell uncle that I never loved him half so dear as now. Oh, don\u0027t remember how affectionate and kind you have all been to me - don\u0027t remember we were ever to be married - but try to think as if I died when I was little, and was buried somewhere. Pray Heaven that I am going away from, have compassion on my uncle! Tell him that I never loved him half so dear. Be his comfort. Love some good girl that will be what I was once to uncle, and be true to you, and worthy of you, and know no shame but me. God bless all! I\u0027ll pray for all, often, on my knees. If he don\u0027t bring me back a lady, and I don\u0027t pray for my own self, I\u0027ll pray for all. My parting love to uncle. My last tears, and my last thanks, for uncle!\"\u0027 That was all. He stood, long after I had ceased to read, still looking at me. At length I ventured to take his hand, and to entreat him, as well as I could, to endeavour to get some command of himself. He replied, \u0027I thankee, sir, I thankee!\u0027 without moving. Ham spoke to him. Mr. Peggotty was so far sensible of HIS affliction, that he wrung his hand; but, otherwise, he remained in the same state, and no one dared to disturb him. Slowly, at last, he moved his eyes from my face, as if he were waking from a vision, and cast them round the room. Then he said, in a low voice: \u0027Who\u0027s the man? I want to know his name.\u0027 Ham glanced at me, and suddenly I felt a shock that struck me back. \u0027There\u0027s a man suspected,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty. \u0027Who is it?\u0027 \u0027Mas\u0027r Davy!\u0027 implored Ham. \u0027Go out a bit, and let me tell him what I must. You doen\u0027t ought to hear it, sir.\u0027 I felt the shock again. I sank down in a chair, and tried to utter some reply; but my tongue was fettered, and my sight was weak. \u0027I want to know his name!\u0027 I heard said once more. \u0027For some time past,\u0027 Ham faltered, \u0027there\u0027s been a servant about here, at odd times. There\u0027s been a gen\u0027lm\u0027n too. Both of \u0027em belonged to one another.\u0027 Mr. Peggotty stood fixed as before, but now looking at him. \u0027The servant,\u0027 pursued Ham, \u0027was seen along with - our poor girl - last night. He\u0027s been in hiding about here, this week or over. He was thought to have gone, but he was hiding. Doen\u0027t stay, Mas\u0027r Davy, doen\u0027t!\u0027 I felt Peggotty\u0027s arm round my neck, but I could not have moved if the house had been about to fall upon me. \u0027A strange chay and hosses was outside town, this morning, on the Norwich road, a\u0027most afore the day broke,\u0027 Ham went on. \u0027The servant went to it, and come from it, and went to it again. When he went to it again, Em\u0027ly was nigh him. The t\u0027other was inside. He\u0027s the man.\u0027 \u0027For the Lord\u0027s love,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, falling back, and putting out his hand, as if to keep off what he dreaded. \u0027Doen\u0027t tell me his name\u0027s Steerforth!\u0027 \u0027Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 exclaimed Ham, in a broken voice, \u0027it ain\u0027t no fault of yourn - and I am far from laying of it to you - but his name is Steerforth, and he\u0027s a damned villain!\u0027 Mr. Peggotty uttered no cry, and shed no tear, and moved no more, until he seemed to wake again, all at once, and pulled down his rough coat from its peg in a corner. \u0027Bear a hand with this! I\u0027m struck of a heap, and can\u0027t do it,\u0027 he said, impatiently. \u0027Bear a hand and help me. Well!\u0027 when somebody had done so. \u0027Now give me that theer hat!\u0027 Ham asked him whither he was going. \u0027I\u0027m a going to seek my niece. I\u0027m a going to seek my Em\u0027ly. I\u0027m a going, first, to stave in that theer boat, and sink it where I would have drownded him, as I\u0027m a living soul, if I had had one thought of what was in him! As he sat afore me,\u0027 he said, wildly, holding out his clenched right hand, \u0027as he sat afore me, face to face, strike me down dead, but I\u0027d have drownded him, and thought it right! - I\u0027m a going to seek my niece.\u0027 \u0027Where?\u0027 cried Ham, interposing himself before the door. \u0027Anywhere! I\u0027m a going to seek my niece through the wureld. I\u0027m a going to find my poor niece in her shame, and bring her back. No one stop me! I tell you I\u0027m a going to seek my niece!\u0027 \u0027No, no!\u0027 cried Mrs. Gummidge, coming between them, in a fit of crying. \u0027No, no, Dan\u0027l, not as you are now. Seek her in a little while, my lone lorn Dan\u0027l, and that\u0027ll be but right! but not as you are now. Sit ye down, and give me your forgiveness for having ever been a worrit to you, Dan\u0027l - what have my contraries ever been to this! - and let us speak a word about them times when she was first an orphan, and when Ham was too, and when I was a poor widder woman, and you took me in. It\u0027ll soften your poor heart, Dan\u0027l,\u0027 laying her head upon his shoulder, \u0027and you\u0027ll bear your sorrow better; for you know the promise, Dan\u0027l, \"As you have done it unto one of the least of these, you have done it unto me\",- and that can never fail under this roof, that\u0027s been our shelter for so many, many year!\u0027 He was quite passive now; and when I heard him crying, the impulse that had been upon me to go down upon my knees, and ask their pardon for the desolation I had caused, and curse Steer- forth, yielded to a better feeling, My overcharged heart found the same relief, and I cried too.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101/5358.html","bookId":208,"book":{"id":208,"title":"David Copperfield大卫·科波菲尔","description":"简介： David Copperfield or The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a novel in 185...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290216055bf31c.jpg","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM"}}
