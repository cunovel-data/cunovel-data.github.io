{"id":6411,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o\u0027clock at night. It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.\n In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by the nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all unlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a Friday night.\n I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result. On the second branch of the question, I will only remark, that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still a baby, I have not come into it yet. But I do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property; and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to keep it.\n I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going people were short of money about that time, or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets, I don\u0027t know; all I know is, that there was but one solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss - for as to sherry, my poor dear mother\u0027s own sherry was in the market then - and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a head, the winner to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it the stipulated five shillings, all in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny short - as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to endeavour without any effect to prove to her. It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned, but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it was, to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the water in her life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which she was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go \u0027meandering\u0027 about the world. It was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this objectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, \u0027Let us have no meandering.\u0027\n Not to meander myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.\n I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or \u0027there by\u0027, as they say in Scotland. I was a posthumous child. My father\u0027s eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it. There is something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw me; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the churchyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night, when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle, and the doors of our house were - almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes - bolted and locked against it.\n An aunt of my father\u0027s, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of whom I shall have more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate of our family. Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always called her, when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all (which was seldom), had been married to a husband younger than herself, who was very handsome, except in the sense of the homely adage, \u0027handsome is, that handsome does\u0027 - for he was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having once, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs\u0027 window. These evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him off, and effect a separation by mutual consent. He went to India with his capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he was once seen riding on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but I think it must have been a Baboo - or a Begum. Anyhow, from India tidings of his death reached home, within ten years. How they affected my aunt, nobody knew; for immediately upon the separation, she took her maiden name again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off, established herself there as a single woman with one servant, and was understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible retirement.\n My father had once been a favourite of hers, I believe; but she was mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was \u0027a wax doll\u0027. She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be not yet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. He was double my mother\u0027s age when he married, and of but a delicate constitution. He died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I came into the world.\n This was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may be excused for calling, that eventful and important Friday. I can make no claim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood; or to have any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what follows.\n My mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and very low in spirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding heavily about herself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by some grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer upstairs, to a world not at all excited on the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting by the fire, that bright, windy March afternoon, very timid and sad, and very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her, when, lifting her eyes as she dried them, to the window opposite, she saw a strange lady coming up the garden.\n MY mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it was Miss Betsey. The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the garden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else.\n When she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity. My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and looked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment.\n She gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday.\n My mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in the corner. Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly, began on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen\u0027s Head in a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother. Then she made a frown and a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed, to come and open the door. My mother went.\n \u0027Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,\u0027 said Miss Betsey; the emphasis referring, perhaps, to my mother\u0027s mourning weeds, and her condition.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said my mother, faintly.\n \u0027Miss Trotwood,\u0027 said the visitor. \u0027You have heard of her, I dare say?\u0027\n My mother answered she had had that pleasure. And she had a disagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure.\n \u0027Now you see her,\u0027 said Miss Betsey. My mother bent her head, and begged her to walk in.\n They went into the parlour my mother had come from, the fire in the best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted - not having been lighted, indeed, since my father\u0027s funeral; and when they were both seated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to restrain herself, began to cry. \u0027Oh tut, tut, tut!\u0027 said Miss Betsey, in a hurry. \u0027Don\u0027t do that! Come, come!\u0027\n My mother couldn\u0027t help it notwithstanding, so she cried until she had had her cry out.\n \u0027Take off your cap, child,\u0027 said Miss Betsey, \u0027and let me see you.\u0027\n MY mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request, if she had any disposition to do so. Therefore she did as she was told, and did it with such nervous hands that her hair (which was luxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her face.\n \u0027Why, bless my heart!\u0027 exclaimed Miss Betsey. \u0027You are a very Baby!\u0027\n My mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even for her years; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing, and said, sobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow, and would be but a childish mother if she lived. In a short pause which ensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair, and that with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid hope, she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up, her hands folded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender, frowning at the fire.\n \u0027In the name of Heaven,\u0027 said Miss Betsey, suddenly, \u0027why Rookery?\u0027\n \u0027Do you mean the house, ma\u0027am?\u0027 asked my mother.\n \u0027Why Rookery?\u0027 said Miss Betsey. \u0027Cookery would have been more to the purpose, if you had had any practical ideas of life, either of you.\u0027\n \u0027The name was Mr. Copperfield\u0027s choice,\u0027 returned my mother. \u0027When he bought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks about it.\u0027\n The evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall old elm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor Miss Betsey could forbear glancing that way. As the elms bent to one another, like giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds of such repose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind, some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks\u0027-nests, burdening their higher branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.\n \u0027Where are the birds?\u0027 asked Miss Betsey.\n \u0027The -? \u0027 My mother had been thinking of something else.\n \u0027The rooks - what has become of them?\u0027 asked Miss Betsey.\n \u0027There have not been any since we have lived here,\u0027 said my mother. \u0027We thought - Mr. Copperfield thought - it was quite a large rookery; but the nests were very old ones, and the birds have deserted them a long while.\u0027\n \u0027David Copperfield all over!\u0027 cried Miss Betsey. \u0027David Copperfield from head to foot! Calls a house a rookery when there\u0027s not a rook near it, and takes the birds on trust, because he sees the nests!\u0027\n \u0027Mr. Copperfield,\u0027 returned my mother, \u0027is dead, and if you dare to speak unkindly of him to me -\u0027\n My poor dear mother, I suppose, had some momentary intention of committing an assault and battery upon my aunt, who could easily have settled her with one hand, even if my mother had been in far better training for such an encounter than she was that evening. But it passed with the action of rising from her chair; and she sat down again very meekly, and fainted.\n When she came to herself, or when Miss Betsey had restored her, whichever it was, she found the latter standing at the window. The twilight was by this time shading down into darkness; and dimly as they saw each other, they could not have done that without the aid of the fire.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 said Miss Betsey, coming back to her chair, as if she had only been taking a casual look at the prospect; \u0027and when do you expect -\u0027\n \u0027I am all in a tremble,\u0027 faltered my mother. \u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the matter. I shall die, I am sure!\u0027\n \u0027No, no, no,\u0027 said Miss Betsey. \u0027Have some tea.\u0027\n \u0027Oh dear me, dear me, do you think it will do me any good?\u0027 cried my mother in a helpless manner.\n \u0027Of course it will,\u0027 said Miss Betsey. \u0027It\u0027s nothing but fancy. What do you call your girl?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know that it will be a girl, yet, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said my mother innocently.\n \u0027Bless the Baby!\u0027 exclaimed Miss Betsey, unconsciously quoting the second sentiment of the pincushion in the drawer upstairs, but applying it to my mother instead of me, \u0027I don\u0027t mean that. I mean your servant-girl.\u0027\n \u0027Peggotty,\u0027 said my mother.\n \u0027Peggotty!\u0027 repeated Miss Betsey, with some indignation. \u0027Do you mean to say, child, that any human being has gone into a Christian church, and got herself named Peggotty?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s her surname,\u0027 said my mother, faintly. \u0027Mr. Copperfield called her by it, because her Christian name was the same as mine.\u0027\n \u0027Here! Peggotty!\u0027 cried Miss Betsey, opening the parlour door. \u0027Tea. Your mistress is a little unwell. Don\u0027t dawdle.\u0027\n Having issued this mandate with as much potentiality as if she had been a recognized authority in the house ever since it had been a house, and having looked out to confront the amazed Peggotty coming along the passage with a candle at the sound of a strange voice, Miss Betsey shut the door again, and sat down as before: with her feet on the fender, the skirt of her dress tucked up, and her hands folded on one knee.\n \u0027You were speaking about its being a girl,\u0027 said Miss Betsey. \u0027I have no doubt it will be a girl. I have a presentiment that it must be a girl. Now child, from the moment of the birth of this girl -\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps boy,\u0027 my mother took the liberty of putting in.\n \u0027I tell you I have a presentiment that it must be a girl,\u0027 returned Miss Betsey. \u0027Don\u0027t contradict. From the moment of this girl\u0027s birth, child, I intend to be her friend. I intend to be her godmother, and I beg you\u0027ll call her Betsey Trotwood Copperfield. There must be no mistakes in life with THIS Betsey Trotwood. There must be no trifling with HER affections, poor dear. She must be well brought up, and well guarded from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved. I must make that MY care.\u0027\n There was a twitch of Miss Betsey\u0027s head, after each of these sentences, as if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any plainer reference to them by strong constraint. So my mother suspected, at least, as she observed her by the low glimmer of the fire: too much scared by Miss Betsey, too uneasy in herself, and too subdued and bewildered altogether, to observe anything very clearly, or to know what to say.\n \u0027And was David good to you, child?\u0027 asked Miss Betsey, when she had been silent for a little while, and these motions of her head had gradually ceased. \u0027Were you comfortable together?\u0027\n \u0027We were very happy,\u0027 said my mother. \u0027Mr. Copperfield was only too good to me.\u0027\n \u0027What, he spoilt you, I suppose?\u0027 returned Miss Betsey.\n \u0027For being quite alone and dependent on myself in this rough world again, yes, I fear he did indeed,\u0027 sobbed my mother.\n \u0027Well! Don\u0027t cry!\u0027 said Miss Betsey. \u0027You were not equally matched, child - if any two people can be equally matched - and so I asked the question. You were an orphan, weren\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027\n \u0027And a governess?\u0027\n \u0027I was nursery-governess in a family where Mr. Copperfield came to visit. Mr. Copperfield was very kind to me, and took a great deal of notice of me, and paid me a good deal of attention, and at last proposed to me. And I accepted him. And so we were married,\u0027 said my mother simply.\n \u0027Ha! Poor Baby!\u0027 mused Miss Betsey, with her frown still bent upon the fire. \u0027Do you know anything?\u0027\n \u0027I beg your pardon, ma\u0027am,\u0027 faltered my mother.\n \u0027About keeping house, for instance,\u0027 said Miss Betsey.\n \u0027Not much, I fear,\u0027 returned my mother. \u0027Not so much as I could wish. But Mr. Copperfield was teaching me -\u0027\n (\u0027Much he knew about it himself!\u0027) said Miss Betsey in a parenthesis.\n - \u0027And I hope I should have improved, being very anxious to learn, and he very patient to teach me, if the great misfortune of his death\u0027 - my mother broke down again here, and could get no farther.\n \u0027Well, well!\u0027 said Miss Betsey.\n -\u0027I kept my housekeeping-book regularly, and balanced it with Mr. Copperfield every night,\u0027 cried my mother in another burst of distress, and breaking down again.\n \u0027Well, well!\u0027 said Miss Betsey. \u0027Don\u0027t cry any more.\u0027\n - \u0027And I am sure we never had a word of difference respecting it, except when Mr. Copperfield objected to my threes and fives being too much like each other, or to my putting curly tails to my sevens and nines,\u0027 resumed my mother in another burst, and breaking down again.\n \u0027You\u0027ll make yourself ill,\u0027 said Miss Betsey, \u0027and you know that will not be good either for you or for my god-daughter. Come! You mustn\u0027t do it!\u0027\n This argument had some share in quieting my mother, though her increasing indisposition had a larger one. There was an interval of silence, only broken by Miss Betsey\u0027s occasionally ejaculating \u0027Ha!\u0027 as she sat with her feet upon the fender.\n \u0027David had bought an annuity for himself with his money, I know,\u0027 said she, by and by. \u0027What did he do for you?\u0027\n \u0027Mr. Copperfield,\u0027 said my mother, answering with some difficulty, \u0027was so considerate and good as to secure the reversion of a part of it to me.\u0027\n \u0027How much?\u0027 asked Miss Betsey.\n \u0027A hundred and five pounds a year,\u0027 said my mother.\n \u0027He might have done worse,\u0027 said my aunt.\n The word was appropriate to the moment. My mother was so much worse that Peggotty, coming in with the teaboard and candles, and seeing at a glance how ill she was, - as Miss Betsey might have done sooner if there had been light enough, - conveyed her upstairs to her own room with all speed; and immediately dispatched Ham Peggotty, her nephew, who had been for some days past secreted in the house, unknown to my mother, as a special messenger in case of emergency, to fetch the nurse and doctor.\n Those allied powers were considerably astonished, when they arrived within a few minutes of each other, to find an unknown lady of portentous appearance, sitting before the fire, with her bonnet tied over her left arm, stopping her ears with jewellers\u0027 cotton. Peggotty knowing nothing about her, and my mother saying nothing about her, she was quite a mystery in the parlour; and the fact of her having a magazine of jewellers\u0027 cotton in her pocket, and sticking the article in her ears in that way, did not detract from the solemnity of her presence.\n The doctor having been upstairs and come down again, and having satisfied himself, I suppose, that there was a probability of this unknown lady and himself having to sit there, face to face, for some hours, laid himself out to be polite and social. He was the meekest of his sex, the mildest of little men. He sidled in and out of a room, to take up the less space. He walked as softly as the Ghost in Hamlet, and more slowly. He carried his head on one side, partly in modest depreciation of himself, partly in modest propitiation of everybody else. It is nothing to say that he hadn\u0027t a word to throw at a dog. He couldn\u0027t have thrown a word at a mad dog. He might have offered him one gently, or half a one, or a fragment of one; for he spoke as slowly as he walked; but he wouldn\u0027t have been rude to him, and he couldn\u0027t have been quick with him, for any earthly consideration.\n Mr. Chillip, looking mildly at my aunt with his head on one side, and making her a little bow, said, in allusion to the jewellers\u0027 cotton, as he softly touched his left ear:\n \u0027Some local irritation, ma\u0027am?\u0027\n \u0027What!\u0027 replied my aunt, pulling the cotton out of one ear like a cork.\n Mr. Chillip was so alarmed by her abruptness - as he told my mother afterwards - that it was a mercy he didn\u0027t lose his presence of mind. But he repeated sweetly:\n \u0027Some local irritation, ma\u0027am?\u0027\n \u0027Nonsense!\u0027 replied my aunt, and corked herself again, at one blow.\n Mr. Chillip could do nothing after this, but sit and look at her feebly, as she sat and looked at the fire, until he was called upstairs again. After some quarter of an hour\u0027s absence, he returned.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 said my aunt, taking the cotton out of the ear nearest to him.\n \u0027Well, ma\u0027am,\u0027 returned Mr. Chillip, \u0027we are- we are progressing slowly, ma\u0027am.\u0027\n \u0027Ba--a--ah!\u0027 said my aunt, with a perfect shake on the contemptuous interjection. And corked herself as before.\n Really - really - as Mr. Chillip told my mother, he was almost shocked; speaking in a professional point of view alone, he was almost shocked. But he sat and looked at her, notwithstanding, for nearly two hours, as she sat looking at the fire, until he was again called out. After another absence, he again returned.\n \u0027Well?\u0027 said my aunt, taking out the cotton on that side again.\n \u0027Well, ma\u0027am,\u0027 returned Mr. Chillip, \u0027we are - we are progressing\n slowly, ma\u0027am.\u0027\n \u0027Ya--a--ah!\u0027 said my aunt. With such a snarl at him, that Mr. Chillip absolutely could not bear it. It was really calculated to break his spirit, he said afterwards. He preferred to go and sit upon the stairs, in the dark and a strong draught, until he was again sent for.\n Ham Peggotty, who went to the national school, and was a very dragon at his catechism, and who may therefore be regarded as a credible witness, reported next day, that happening to peep in at the parlour-door an hour after this, he was instantly descried by Miss Betsey, then walking to and fro in a state of agitation, and pounced upon before he could make his escape. That there were now occasional sounds of feet and voices overhead which he inferred the cotton did not exclude, from the circumstance of his evidently being clutched by the lady as a victim on whom to expend her superabundant agitation when the sounds were loudest. That, marching him constantly up and down by the collar (as if he had been taking too much laudanum), she, at those times, shook him, rumpled his hair, made light of his linen, stopped his ears as if she confounded them with her own, and otherwise tousled and maltreated him. This was in part confirmed by his aunt, who saw him at half past twelve o\u0027clock, soon after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was.\n The mild Mr. Chillip could not possibly bear malice at such a time, if at any time. He sidled into the parlour as soon as he was at liberty, and said to my aunt in his meekest manner:\n \u0027Well, ma\u0027am, I am happy to congratulate you.\u0027\n \u0027What upon?\u0027 said my aunt, sharply.\n Mr. Chillip was fluttered again, by the extreme severity of my aunt\u0027s manner; so he made her a little bow and gave her a little smile, to mollify her.\n \u0027Mercy on the man, what\u0027s he doing!\u0027 cried my aunt, impatiently. \u0027Can\u0027t he speak?\u0027\n \u0027Be calm, my dear ma\u0027am,\u0027 said Mr. Chillip, in his softest accents.\n \u0027There is no longer any occasion for uneasiness, ma\u0027am. Be calm.\u0027\n It has since been considered almost a miracle that my aunt didn\u0027t shake him, and shake what he had to say, out of him. She only shook her own head at him, but in a way that made him quail.\n \u0027Well, ma\u0027am,\u0027 resumed Mr. Chillip, as soon as he had courage, \u0027I am happy to congratulate you. All is now over, ma\u0027am, and well over.\u0027\n During the five minutes or so that Mr. Chillip devoted to the delivery of this oration, my aunt eyed him narrowly.\n \u0027How is she?\u0027 said my aunt, folding her arms with her bonnet still tied on one of them.\n \u0027Well, ma\u0027am, she will soon be quite comfortable, I hope,\u0027 returned Mr. Chillip. \u0027Quite as comfortable as we can expect a young mother to be, under these melancholy domestic circumstances. There cannot be any objection to your seeing her presently, ma\u0027am. It may do her good.\u0027\n \u0027And SHE. How is SHE?\u0027 said my aunt, sharply.\n Mr. Chillip laid his head a little more on one side, and looked at my aunt like an amiable bird.\n \u0027The baby,\u0027 said my aunt. \u0027How is she?\u0027\n \u0027Ma\u0027am,\u0027 returned Mr. Chillip, \u0027I apprehended you had known. It\u0027s a boy.\u0027\n My aunt said never a word, but took her bonnet by the strings, in the manner of a sling, aimed a blow at Mr. Chillip\u0027s head with it, put it on bent, walked out, and never came back. She vanished like a discontented fairy; or like one of those supernatural beings, whom it was popularly supposed I was entitled to see; and never came back any more.\n No. I lay in my basket, and my mother lay in her bed; but Betsey Trotwood Copperfield was for ever in the land of dreams and shadows, the tremendous region whence I had so lately travelled; and the light upon the window of our room shone out upon the earthly bourne of all such travellers, and the mound above the ashes and the dust that once was he, without whom I had never been.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101/5328.html","bookId":208,"book":{"id":208,"title":"David Copperfield大卫·科波菲尔","description":"简介： David Copperfield or The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a novel in 185...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290216055bf31c.jpg","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM"}}
