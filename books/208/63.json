{"id":6473,"no":63,"title":"Chapter 63","content":"What I have purposed to record is nearly finished; but there is yet an incident conspicuous in my memory, on which it often rests with delight, and without which one thread in the web I have spun would have a ravelled end. \\n\\n I had advanced in fame and fortune, my domestic joy was perfect, I had been married ten happy years. Agnes and I were sitting by the fire, in our house in London, one night in spring, and three of our children were playing in the room, when I was told that a stranger wished to see me. \\n\\n He had been asked if he came on business, and had answered No; he had come for the pleasure of seeing me, and had come a long way. He was an old man, my servant said, and looked like a farmer. \\n\\n As this sounded mysterious to the children, and moreover was like the beginning of a favourite story Agnes used to tell them, introductory to the arrival of a wicked old Fairy in a cloak who hated everybody, it produced some commotion. One of our boys laid his head in his mother\u0027s lap to be out of harm\u0027s way, and little Agnes (our eldest child) left her doll in a chair to represent her, and thrust out her little heap of golden curls from between the window-curtains, to see what happened next. \\n\\n \u0027Let him come in here!\u0027 said I. \\n\\n There soon appeared, pausing in the dark doorway as he entered, a hale, grey-haired old man. Little Agnes, attracted by his looks, had run to bring him in, and I had not yet clearly seen his face, when my wife, starting up, cried out to me, in a pleased and agitated voice, that it was Mr. Peggotty! \\n\\n It WAS Mr. Peggotty. An old man now, but in a ruddy, hearty, strong old age. When our first emotion was over, and he sat before the fire with the children on his knees, and the blaze shining on his face, he looked, to me, as vigorous and robust, withal as handsome, an old man, as ever I had seen. \\n\\n \u0027Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 said he. And the old name in the old tone fell so naturally on my ear! \u0027Mas\u0027r Davy, \u0027tis a joyful hour as I see you, once more, \u0027long with your own trew wife!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027A joyful hour indeed, old friend!\u0027 cried I. \\n\\n \u0027And these heer pretty ones,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty. \u0027To look at these heer flowers! Why, Mas\u0027r Davy, you was but the heighth of the littlest of these, when I first see you! When Em\u0027ly warn\u0027t no bigger, and our poor lad were BUT a lad!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Time has changed me more than it has changed you since then,\u0027 said I. \u0027But let these dear rogues go to bed; and as no house in England but this must hold you, tell me where to send for your luggage (is the old black bag among it, that went so far, I wonder!), and then, over a glass of Yarmouth grog, we will have the tidings of ten years!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Are you alone?\u0027 asked Agnes. \\n\\n \u0027Yes, ma\u0027am,\u0027 he said, kissing her hand, \u0027quite alone.\u0027 \\n\\n We sat him between us, not knowing how to give him welcome enough; and as I began to listen to his old familiar voice, I could have fancied he was still pursuing his long journey in search of his darling niece. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a mort of water,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, \u0027fur to come across, and on\u0027y stay a matter of fower weeks. But water (\u0027specially when \u0027tis salt) comes nat\u0027ral to me; and friends is dear, and I am heer. - Which is verse,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, surprised to find it out, \u0027though I hadn\u0027t such intentions.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Are you going back those many thousand miles, so soon?\u0027 asked Agnes. \\n\\n \u0027Yes, ma\u0027am,\u0027 he returned. \u0027I giv the promise to Em\u0027ly, afore I come away. You see, I doen\u0027t grow younger as the years comes round, and if I hadn\u0027t sailed as \u0027twas, most like I shouldn\u0027t never have done \u0027t. And it\u0027s allus been on my mind, as I must come and see Mas\u0027r Davy and your own sweet blooming self, in your wedded happiness, afore I got to be too old.\u0027 \\n\\n He looked at us, as if he could never feast his eyes on us sufficiently. Agnes laughingly put back some scattered locks of his grey hair, that he might see us better. \\n\\n \u0027And now tell us,\u0027 said I, \u0027everything relating to your fortunes.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Our fortuns, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 he rejoined, \u0027is soon told. We haven\u0027t fared nohows, but fared to thrive. We\u0027ve allus thrived. We\u0027ve worked as we ought to \u0027t, and maybe we lived a leetle hard at first or so, but we have allus thrived. What with sheep-farming, and what with stock-farming, and what with one thing and what with t\u0027other, we are as well to do, as well could be. Theer\u0027s been kiender a blessing fell upon us,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, reverentially inclining his head, \u0027and we\u0027ve done nowt but prosper. That is, in the long run. If not yesterday, why then today. If not today, why then tomorrow.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027And Emily?\u0027 said Agnes and I, both together. \\n\\n \u0027Em\u0027ly,\u0027 said he, \u0027arter you left her, ma\u0027am - and I never heerd her saying of her prayers at night, t\u0027other side the canvas screen, when we was settled in the Bush, but what I heerd your name - and arter she and me lost sight of Mas\u0027r Davy, that theer shining sundown - was that low, at first, that, if she had know\u0027d then what Mas\u0027r Davy kep from us so kind and thowtful, \u0027tis my opinion she\u0027d have drooped away. But theer was some poor folks aboard as had illness among \u0027em, and she took care of them; and theer was the children in our company, and she took care of them; and so she got to be busy, and to be doing good, and that helped her.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027When did she first hear of it?\u0027 I asked. \\n\\n \u0027I kep it from her arter I heerd on \u0027t,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, \u0027going on nigh a year. We was living then in a solitary place, but among the beautifullest trees, and with the roses a-covering our Beein to the roof. Theer come along one day, when I was out a-working on the land, a traveller from our own Norfolk or Suffolk in England (I doen\u0027t rightly mind which), and of course we took him in, and giv him to eat and drink, and made him welcome. We all do that, all the colony over. He\u0027d got an old newspaper with him, and some other account in print of the storm. That\u0027s how she know\u0027d it. When I came home at night, I found she know\u0027d it.\u0027 \\n\\n He dropped his voice as he said these words, and the gravity I so well remembered overspread his face. \\n\\n \u0027Did it change her much?\u0027 we asked. \\n\\n \u0027Aye, for a good long time,\u0027 he said, shaking his head; \u0027if not to this present hour. But I think the solitoode done her good. And she had a deal to mind in the way of poultry and the like, and minded of it, and come through. I wonder,\u0027 he said thoughtfully, \u0027if you could see my Em\u0027ly now, Mas\u0027r Davy, whether you\u0027d know her!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Is she so altered?\u0027 I inquired. \\n\\n \u0027I doen\u0027t know. I see her ev\u0027ry day, and doen\u0027t know; But, odd-times, I have thowt so. A slight figure,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, looking at the fire, \u0027kiender worn; soft, sorrowful, blue eyes; a delicate face; a pritty head, leaning a little down; a quiet voice and way - timid a\u0027most. That\u0027s Em\u0027ly!\u0027 \\n\\n We silently observed him as he sat, still looking at the fire. \\n\\n \u0027Some thinks,\u0027 he said, \u0027as her affection was ill-bestowed; some, as her marriage was broken off by death. No one knows how \u0027tis. She might have married well, a mort of times, \"but, uncle,\" she says to me, \"that\u0027s gone for ever.\" Cheerful along with me; retired when others is by; fond of going any distance fur to teach a child, or fur to tend a sick person, or fur to do some kindness tow\u0027rds a young girl\u0027s wedding (and she\u0027s done a many, but has never seen one); fondly loving of her uncle; patient; liked by young and old; sowt out by all that has any trouble. That\u0027s Em\u0027ly!\u0027 \\n\\n He drew his hand across his face, and with a half-suppressed sigh looked up from the fire. \\n\\n \u0027Is Martha with you yet?\u0027 I asked. \\n\\n \u0027Martha,\u0027 he replied, \u0027got married, Mas\u0027r Davy, in the second year. A young man, a farm-labourer, as come by us on his way to market with his mas\u0027r\u0027s drays - a journey of over five hundred mile, theer and back - made offers fur to take her fur his wife (wives is very scarce theer), and then to set up fur their two selves in the Bush. She spoke to me fur to tell him her trew story. I did. They was married, and they live fower hundred mile away from any voices but their own and the singing birds.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Mrs. Gummidge?\u0027 I suggested. \\n\\n It was a pleasant key to touch, for Mr. Peggotty suddenly burst into a roar of laughter, and rubbed his hands up and down his legs, as he had been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the long-shipwrecked boat. \\n\\n \u0027Would you believe it!\u0027 he said. \u0027Why, someun even made offer fur to marry her! If a ship\u0027s cook that was turning settler, Mas\u0027r Davy, didn\u0027t make offers fur to marry Missis Gummidge, I\u0027m Gormed - and I can\u0027t say no fairer than that!\u0027 \\n\\n I never saw Agnes laugh so. This sudden ecstasy on the part of Mr. Peggotty was so delightful to her, that she could not leave off laughing; and the more she laughed the more she made me laugh, and the greater Mr. Peggotty\u0027s ecstasy became, and the more he rubbed his legs. \\n\\n \u0027And what did Mrs. Gummidge say?\u0027 I asked, when I was grave enough. \\n\\n \u0027If you\u0027ll believe me,\u0027 returned Mr. Peggotty, \u0027Missis Gummidge, \u0027stead of saying \"thank you, I\u0027m much obleeged to you, I ain\u0027t a-going fur to change my condition at my time of life,\" up\u0027d with a bucket as was standing by, and laid it over that theer ship\u0027s cook\u0027s head \u0027till he sung out fur help, and I went in and reskied of him.\u0027 \\n\\n Mr. Peggotty burst into a great roar of laughter, and Agnes and I both kept him company. \\n\\n \u0027But I must say this, for the good creetur,\u0027 he resumed, wiping his face, when we were quite exhausted; \u0027she has been all she said she\u0027d be to us, and more. She\u0027s the willingest, the trewest, the honestest-helping woman, Mas\u0027r Davy, as ever draw\u0027d the breath of life. I have never know\u0027d her to be lone and lorn, for a single minute, not even when the colony was all afore us, and we was new to it. And thinking of the old \u0027un is a thing she never done, I do assure you, since she left England!\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Now, last, not least, Mr. Micawber,\u0027 said I. \u0027He has paid off every obligation he incurred here - even to Traddles\u0027s bill, you remember my dear Agnes - and therefore we may take it for granted that he is doing well. But what is the latest news of him?\u0027 \\n\\n Mr. Peggotty, with a smile, put his hand in his breast-pocket, and produced a flat-folded, paper parcel, from which he took out, with much care, a little odd-looking newspaper. \\n\\n \u0027You are to understan\u0027, Mas\u0027r Davy,\u0027 said he, \u0027as we have left the Bush now, being so well to do; and have gone right away round to Port Middlebay Harbour, wheer theer\u0027s what we call a town.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Mr. Micawber was in the Bush near you?\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \u0027Bless you, yes,\u0027 said Mr. Peggotty, \u0027and turned to with a will. I never wish to meet a better gen\u0027l\u0027man for turning to with a will. I\u0027ve seen that theer bald head of his a perspiring in the sun, Mas\u0027r Davy, till I a\u0027most thowt it would have melted away. And now he\u0027s a Magistrate.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027A Magistrate, eh?\u0027 said I. \\n\\n Mr. Peggotty pointed to a certain paragraph in the newspaper, where I read aloud as follows, from the Port Middlebay Times: \\n\\n \u0027The public dinner to our distinguished fellow-colonist and townsman, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, Port Middlebay District Magistrate, came off yesterday in the large room of the Hotel, which was crowded to suffocation. It is estimated that not fewer than forty-seven persons must have been accommodated with dinner at one time, exclusive of the company in the passage and on the stairs. The beauty, fashion, and exclusiveness of Port Middlebay, flocked to do honour to one so deservedly esteemed, so highly talented, and so widely popular. Doctor Mell (of Colonial Salem-House Grammar School, Port Middlebay) presided, and on his right sat the distinguished guest. After the removal of the cloth, and the singing of Non Nobis (beautifully executed, and in which we were at no loss to distinguish the bell-like notes of that gifted amateur, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR), the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturously received. Doctor Mell, in a speech replete with feeling, then proposed \"Our distinguished Guest, the ornament of our town. May he never leave us but to better himself, and may his success among us be such as to render his bettering himself impossible!\" The cheering with which the toast was received defies description. Again and again it rose and fell, like the waves of ocean. At length all was hushed, and WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, presented himself to return thanks. Far be it from us, in the present comparatively imperfect state of the resources of our establishment, to endeavour to follow our distinguished townsman through the smoothly-flowing periods of his polished and highly-ornate address! Suffice it to observe, that it was a masterpiece of eloquence; and that those passages in which he more particularly traced his own successful career to its source, and warned the younger portion of his auditory from the shoals of ever incurring pecuniary liabilities which they were unable to liquidate, brought a tear into the manliest eye present. The remaining toasts were DOCTOR MELL; Mrs. MICAWBER (who gracefully bowed her acknowledgements from the side-door, where a galaxy of beauty was elevated on chairs, at once to witness and adorn the gratifying scene), Mrs. RIDGER BEGS (late Miss Micawber); Mrs. MELL; WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR (who convulsed the assembly by humorously remarking that he found himself unable to return thanks in a speech, but would do so, with their permission, in a song); Mrs. MICAWBER\u0027S FAMILY (well known, it is needless to remark, in the mother-country), \u0026c. \u0026c. \u0026c. At the conclusion of the proceedings the tables were cleared as if by art-magic for dancing. Among the votaries of TERPSICHORE, who disported themselves until Sol gave warning for departure, Wilkins Micawber, Esquire, Junior, and the lovely and accomplished Miss Helena, fourth daughter of Doctor Mell, were particularly remarkable.\u0027 \\n\\n I was looking back to the name of Doctor Mell, pleased to have discovered, in these happier circumstances, Mr. Mell, formerly poor pinched usher to my Middlesex magistrate, when Mr. Peggotty pointing to another part of the paper, my eyes rested on my own name, and I read thus: \\n\\n \u0027 TO DAVID COPPERFIELD, ESQUIRE, \\n\\n \u0027THE EMINENT AUTHOR. \\n\\n \u0027My Dear Sir, \\n\\n \u0027Years have elapsed, since I had an opportunity of ocularly perusing the lineaments, now familiar to the imaginations of a considerable portion of the civilized world. \\n\\n \u0027But, my dear Sir, though estranged (by the force of circumstances over which I have had no control) from the personal society of the friend and companion of my youth, I have not been unmindful of his soaring flight. Nor have I been debarred, \\n\\n Though seas between us braid ha\u0027 roared, \\n\\n (BURNS) from participating in the intellectual feasts he has spread before us. \\n\\n \u0027I cannot, therefore, allow of the departure from this place of an individual whom we mutually respect and esteem, without, my dear Sir, taking this public opportunity of thanking you, on my own behalf, and, I may undertake to add, on that of the whole of the Inhabitants of Port Middlebay, for the gratification of which you are the ministering agent. \\n\\n \u0027Go on, my dear Sir! You are not unknown here, you are not unappreciated. Though \"remote\", we are neither \"unfriended\", \"melancholy\", nor (I may add) \"slow\". Go on, my dear Sir, in your Eagle course! The inhabitants of Port Middlebay may at least aspire to watch it, with delight, with entertainment, with instruction! \\n\\n \u0027Among the eyes elevated towards you from this portion of the globe, will ever be found, while it has light and life, \\n\\n \u0027The \u0027Eye \u0027Appertaining to \\n\\n \u0027WILKINS MICAWBER, \u0027Magistrate.\u0027 \\n\\n I found, on glancing at the remaining contents of the newspaper, that Mr. Micawber was a diligent and esteemed correspondent of that journal. There was another letter from him in the same paper, touching a bridge; there was an advertisement of a collection of similar letters by him, to be shortly republished, in a neat volume, \u0027with considerable additions\u0027; and, unless I am very much mistaken, the Leading Article was his also. \\n\\n We talked much of Mr. Micawber, on many other evenings while Mr. Peggotty remained with us. He lived with us during the whole term of his stay, - which, I think, was something less than a month, - and his sister and my aunt came to London to see him. Agnes and I parted from him aboard-ship, when he sailed; and we shall never part from him more, on earth. \\n\\n But before he left, he went with me to Yarmouth, to see a little tablet I had put up in the churchyard to the memory of Ham. While I was copying the plain inscription for him at his request, I saw him stoop, and gather a tuft of grass from the grave and a little earth. \\n\\n \u0027For Em\u0027ly,\u0027 he said, as he put it in his breast. \u0027I promised, Mas\u0027r Davy.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101/5390.html","bookId":208,"book":{"id":208,"title":"David Copperfield大卫·科波菲尔","description":"简介： David Copperfield or The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (which he never meant to publish on any account)is a novel by Charles Dickens, first published as a novel in 185...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290216055bf31c.jpg","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/101","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM"}}
