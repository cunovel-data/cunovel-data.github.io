{"id":39151,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV. \u0027THEY SHALL PASS, AND THEIR PLACES BE TAKEN?\u0027","content":"The letter which told Miss Bellingham that her lover was master of Penwyn seemed to her almost like the end of a fairy tale. Lady Cheshunt had dropped in to afternoon tea only a quarter of an hour before the letter arrived, and Madge was busy with the old Battersea cups and saucers, and the quaint little Wedgwood teapot, when the accomplished serving man, who never abated one iota of his professional solemnity because his wages were doubtful, presented Churchill\u0027s letter on an antique salver. \u0027Put it on the table, please,\u0027 said Madge, busy with the tea-service, and painfully conscious that the dowager\u0027s eye was upon her. She had recognised Churchill\u0027s hand at a glance, and thought how daring, nay, even impudent it was of him to234 write to her. It was mean of him to take such advantage of her weakness that Sunday morning, she thought. True, that in one fatal moment she had let him discover the secret she was most anxious to hide; but she had given him no right over her. She had made him no promise. Her love had been admitted hypothetically. \u0027If we lived in a different world. If I had myself only to consider,\u0027 she had said to him; which meant that she would have nothing to do with him under existing circumstances. She glanced at Viola, that fragile Sèvres china beauty, with her air of being unfitted for the vulgar uses of life. \u0027Poor child! For her sake I ought to marry Mr. Balecroft, that pompous Manchester merchant; or that vapid young fop, Sir Henry Featherstone,\u0027 she thought, with a sigh. \u0027Read your letter, my dear love,\u0027 said Lady Cheshunt, leaning over the tray to put an extra lump of sugar into her cup, and scrutinizing the address of that epistle which had brought the warm crimson blood to Madge Bellingham\u0027s cheeks and235 brow. The good-natured dowager permitted herself this breach of good breeding, in the warmth of her affection for Madge. The handwriting was masculine, evidently. That was all Lady Cheshunt could discover. Miss Bellingham broke the seal, trying to look composed and indifferent, but after hurriedly reading Churchill\u0027s brief letter, gave a little cry of horror. \u0027Good heavens! it is too dreadful!\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027What is too dreadful, child?\u0027 \u0027You remember what we were talking about last Saturday night, when you took so much trouble to warn me against allowing myself to—to entangle myself—I think that\u0027s what you called it—with Mr. Penwyn.\u0027 \u0027With the poor Mr. Penwyn. I remember, perfectly; and that letter is from him—the man has had the audacity to propose to you? You may well say it is too dreadful.\u0027 \u0027His cousin has been murdered, Lady Cheshunt—his cousin, Mr. James Penwyn.\u0027 236 \u0027And your man comes into the Penwyn estate,\u0027 cried the energetic dowager. \u0027My dearest Madge, I congratulate you! Poor young Penwyn! A boy at school, or a lad at the University, I believe. Nobody seems to know much about him.\u0027 \u0027He has been murdered. Shot from behind a hedge by some midnight assassin. Isn\u0027t that dreadful?\u0027 said Madge, too much shocked by the tidings in her lover\u0027s letter to consider the difference this event might make in her own fortunes. She could not be glad all at once, though that one man whom her heart had chosen for its master was raised from poverty to opulence. For a little while at least, she could only think of the victim. \u0027Very dreadful!\u0027 echoed Lady Cheshunt. \u0027The police ought to prevent such things. One pays highway rates, and sewer rates, and so forth, till one is positively ruined, and yet one can be murdered on the very high road one pays for, with impunity. There must be something wrong in the legislature. I hope things will be better when our party comes in. Look at that child Viola, she\u0027s as white as a sheet of paper—just as if she were going to faint.237 You shouldn\u0027t blurt out your murders in that abrupt way, Madge.\u0027 Viola gave a little hysterical sob, and promised not to faint this time. She was but a fragile piece of human porcelain, given to swooning at the slightest provocation. She went round to Madge, and knelt down by her, and kissed her fondly, knowing enough of her sister\u0027s feelings to comprehend that this fatal event was likely to benefit Madge. \u0027Odd that I did not see anything of this business in the papers,\u0027 exclaimed Lady Cheshunt. \u0027But then I only read the Post, and that does not make a feature of murders.\u0027 \u0027Papa is at Newmarket,\u0027 said Viola, \u0027and Madge and I never look at the papers, or hear any news while he is away.\u0027 Madge sat silent, looking at Churchill\u0027s letter till every word seemed to burn itself into her brain. The firm, straight hand, the letters long and narrow, and a little pointed—something like that wonderful writing of Joseph Addison\u0027s—how well she knew it! 238 \u0027And yet he must have been agitated,\u0027 thought Madge. \u0027Even his quiet force of character could not stand against such a shock as this. After what he said to me, too, last Sunday—to think that wealth and position should have come to him so suddenly. There seems something awful in it.\u0027 Lady Cheshunt had quite recovered her habitual gaiety by this time, and dismissed James Penwyn\u0027s death as a subject that was done with for the moment, merely expressing her intention of reading the details of the event in the newspapers at her leisure. \u0027And so, my dear Madge, Mr. Penwyn wrote to you immediately,\u0027 she said. \u0027Doesn\u0027t that look rather as if there were some kind of understanding between you?\u0027 \u0027There was no understanding between us, Lady Cheshunt, except that I could never be Mr. Penwyn\u0027s wife while he was a poor man. He understood that perfectly. I told him in the plainest, hardest words, like a woman of the world as I am.\u0027 \u0027You needn\u0027t say that so contemptuously, Madge. I\u0027m a woman of the world, and I own it without a239 blush. What\u0027s the use of living in the world if you don\u0027t acquire worldly wisdom? It\u0027s like living ever so long in a foreign country without learning the language, and implies egregious stupidity. And so you told Churchill Penwyn that you couldn\u0027t marry him on account of his poverty! and you pledged yourself to wait ten or twenty years for him, I suppose, and refuse every decent offer for his sake?\u0027 \u0027No, Lady Cheshunt, I promised nothing.\u0027 \u0027Well, my dear, Providence has been very good to you: for, no doubt, if Mr. Penwyn had remained poor you\u0027d have made a fool of yourself sooner or later for his sake, and gone to live in Bloomsbury, where even I couldn\u0027t have visited you, on account of my servants. One might get over that sort of thing one\u0027s self, but coachmen are so particular where they wait.\u0027 Her ladyship rattled on for another quarter of an hour, promised Madge to come and stay at Penwyn Manor with her by and by, congratulated Viola on her sister\u0027s good fortune, hoped that her dear Madge would make a point of spending the season in London when she became Mrs. Penwyn; while Madge sat240 unresponsive, hardly listening to this flow of commonplace, but thinking how awful fortune was when it came thus suddenly, and had death for its herald. She felt relieved when Lady Cheshunt gathered up her silken train for the last time, and went rustling downstairs to the elegant Victoria which appeared far too fairy-like a vehicle to contain that bulky matron. \u0027Thank Heaven she\u0027s gone!\u0027 cried Madge. \u0027How she does talk!\u0027 \u0027Yes, dear, but she is always kind,\u0027 pleaded Viola, \u0027and so fond of you.\u0027 Madge put her arms round the girl and kissed her passionately. That sisterly love of hers was almost the strongest feeling in her breast, and all Madge\u0027s affections were strong. She had no milk-and-water love. \u0027Dearest!\u0027 she said softly, \u0027how happy we can be now! I hope it isn\u0027t wicked to be happy when fortune comes to us in such a dreadful manner.\u0027 \u0027You do care a little for Mr. Penwyn, then, dear?\u0027 said Viola, without entering upon this somewhat obscure question. 241 \u0027I love him with all my heart and soul.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Madge, and you never told me!\u0027 \u0027Why tell you something that might make you unhappy? I should never have dreamt of marrying Churchill but for this turn in Fortune\u0027s wheel. I wanted to make what is called a good marriage, for your sake, darling, more than for my own. I wanted to win a happy home for you, so that when your time came to marry you might not be pressed or harassed by worldly people as I have been, and might follow the dictates of your own heart.\u0027 \u0027Oh, Madge, you are quite too good,\u0027 cried Viola, with enthusiasm. \u0027And we may be very happy, mayn\u0027t we, my pet?\u0027 continued the elder, \u0027living together at a picturesque old place in Cornwall, with the great waves of the Atlantic rolling up to the edge of our grounds—and in London sometimes, if Churchill likes—and knowing no more of debt and difficulty, or cutting and contriving so as to look like ladies upon the income of ladies\u0027 maids. Life will begin afresh for us, Viola.\u0027 \u0027Poor papa!\u0027 sighed Viola, \u0027you\u0027ll be kind to him, won\u0027t you, Madge?\u0027 242 \u0027My dearest, you know that I love him. Papa will be very glad, depend upon it, and he will like to go back to his old bachelor ways, I dare say, now that he will not be burthened with two marriageable daughters.\u0027 \u0027When will you be married, Madge?\u0027 \u0027Oh, not for ever so long, dear; not for a twelvemonth, I should think. Churchill will be in mourning for his cousin, and it wouldn\u0027t look well for him to marry soon after such a dreadful event.\u0027 \u0027I suppose not. Are you to see him soon?\u0027 \u0027Very soon, love. Here is his postscript. \u0027Madge read the last lines of her lover\u0027s letter: \u0027\"I shall come back to town directly the inquest is over, and all arrangements made, and my first visit shall be to you.\"\u0027 \u0027Of course. And you really, really love him, Madge?\u0027 asked Viola, anxiously. \u0027Really, really. But why ask that question, Viola, after what I told you just now?\u0027 \u0027Only because you\u0027ve taken me by surprise, dear; and—don\u0027t be angry with me, Madge—because Churchill Penwyn has never been a favourite of243 mine. But of course now I shall begin to like him immensely. You\u0027re so much better a judge of character than I am, you see, Madge, and if you think him good and true——\u0027 \u0027I have never thought of his goodness or his truth,\u0027 said Madge, with rather a gloomy look. \u0027I only know that I love him.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2127/60219.html","bookId":486,"book":{"id":486,"title":"A Strange World","description":"简介： A fair slope of land in buttercup-time, just when May, the capricious, melts into tender Junea slope of fertile pasture within two miles of the city of Eborsham, whose cathedral towers rise tall in the blue dim distancea wealth of hedgerow flowers on...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
