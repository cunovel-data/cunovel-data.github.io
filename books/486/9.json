{"id":39145,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX. \u0027OTHER SINS ONLY SPEAK; MURDER SHRIEKS OUT.\u0027","content":"Very radiant were Justina\u0027s dreams during the brief hours that remained to her for slumber after that Bohemian supper party—dreams of her sweet new life, in which all things were bright and strange. She was with her lover in a garden—the dream-garden which those sleepers know who have seen but little of earthly gardens—a garden where there were marble terraces and statues, and fountains, and a placid lake lying in a valley of bloom; a vision made up of faint memories of pictures she had seen, or poems she had read. They were together and happy in the noonday sunshine. And then the dream changed. They were together in the moonlight again—not outside the cathedral, but in the long solemn nave. She could see the141 distant altar gleaming faintly in the silver light, while a solemn strain of music, like the muffled chanting of a choir, rolled along the echoing arches overhead. Then the silvery light faded, the music changed to a harsh dirge-like cry, and she woke to hear the raindrops pattering against her little dormer window—Justina\u0027s room was the worst of the three bedchambers, and in the garret story,—and a shrill-voiced hawker bawling watercresses along the street. She had the feeling of having overslept herself, and not being provided with a watch had no power to ascertain the fact, but was fain to dress as quickly as she could, trusting to the cathedral clock to inform her of the hour. To be late for rehearsal involved a good deal of snubbing from the higher powers, even in a commonwealth. The stage manager retained his authority, and knew how to make himself disagreeable. Life seemed all reality again this morning as Justina plaited her hair before the shabby little mirror, and looked out at the dull grey sky, the wet sloppy streets, the general aspect of poverty and142 damp which pervaded the prospect. She had need to ask herself if yesterday and the night before had not been all dreaming. She the chosen bride of a rich young squire—she the mistress of Penwyn Manor! It was surely too fond a fancy. She, whose shabby weather-stained under garments—the green stuff gown of two winters ago converted into a petticoat last year, and worn threadbare—the corset which a nursemaid might have despised—lay yonder on the dilapidated rush-bottomed chair, like the dull reality of Cinderella\u0027s rags, after the fairy ball dress had melted into air. She hurried on her clothes, more ashamed of their shabbiness than she had ever felt yet, and ran down to the sitting-room, which smelt of stale lobster and tobacco, the windows not having been opened on account of the rain. Breakfast was laid. A sloppy cup and saucer, the dorsal bone of a haddock on a greasy plate indicated that some one had breakfasted. The cathedral clock chimed eleven. Justina\u0027s rehearsal only began at half-past. She had time to take her breakfast comfortably, if she liked. Her first act was to open the window, and let in143 the air, and the rain—anything was better than stale lobster. Then she looked into the teapot, and wondered who had breakfasted, and if her father were up. Then she poured out a cup of tea, and sipped it slowly, wondering if James Penwyn would come to the theatre while she was rehearsing. He had asked her the hour of the rehearsal. She thought she would see him there, most likely; and the dream would begin again. A jug of wild flowers stood on the table by the window—the flowers she had gathered two days ago; before she had seen him. They were a little faded—wild flowers droop so early—but in no wise dead; and yet a passion had been born and attained its majority since those field flowers were plucked. Could she believe in it? could she trust in it? Her heart sank at the thought that her lover was trifling with her—that there was nothing but foolishness in this first love dream. Her father had not yet left his room. Justina saw his one presentable pair of boots waiting for him outside his door, as she went by on her way downstairs. 144 She found Mr. and Mrs. Dempson at rehearsal, both with a faded and washed-out appearance, as if the excitement of the previous day had taken all the colour out of them. The rehearsal went forward in a straggling way. That good house of last night seemed to have demoralized the commonwealth, or perhaps the scene of dissipation going on out of doors, the races and holiday-makers, and bustle of the town, may have had a disturbing influence. The stage manager lost his temper, and said business was business, and he didn\u0027t want the burlesque to be a \u0027munge\u0027—a word borrowed from some unknown tongue, which evidently made an impression upon the actors. Justina had been in the theatre for a little more than an hour, when Mr. Elgood burst suddenly into the green-room, pale as a sheet of letter-paper, and wearing his hat anyhow. \u0027Has anybody heard of it?\u0027 he asked, looking round at the assembly. Mrs. Dempson was sitting in a corner covering a satin shoe. Justina stood by the window studying her part in the burlesque.145 Mr. Dempson, with three or four kindred spirits, was smoking on some stone steps just outside the green-room. Everybody looked round at this sudden appeal, wondering at the actor\u0027s scared expression of countenance. \u0027Why, what\u0027s up, mate?\u0027 asked Mr. Dempson. \u0027Is the cathedral on fire? Bear up under the affliction; I dare say it\u0027s insured.\u0027 \u0027Nobody has heard, then?\u0027 \u0027Heard what?\u0027 \u0027Of the murder.\u0027 \u0027What murder? Who\u0027s murdered?\u0027 cried every one at once, except Justina. Her thoughts were slower than the rest, perhaps. She stood looking at her father, fixed as marble. \u0027That poor young fellow, that good-hearted young fellow who stood treat yesterday. Did you ever know such a blackguard thing, Demps? Shot from behind a hedge, on the road between Lowgate and the \"Waterfowl.\" Only found this morning between five and six, by some labourers going to their work. Dead and cold; shot through the heart. He\u0027s lying at the \"Lowgate Arms,\" just inside the archway, and146 there\u0027s to be a coroner\u0027s inquest at two o\u0027clock this afternoon.\u0027 \u0027Great Heaven, how awful!\u0027 cried Dempson. \u0027What was the motive? Robbery, I suppose.\u0027 \u0027So it was thought at first, for his pockets were empty, turned inside out. But the police searched the ditch for the weapon, which they didn\u0027t find, but found his watch and purse and pocket-book, half an hour ago, buried in the mud, as if they had been rammed down with a stick. So there must have been revenge at the bottom of the business, unless it was that the fellows who did it—I dare say there was more than one—took the alarm, and hid the plunder, with the intention of fishing it up again on the quiet afterwards.\u0027 \u0027It looks more like that,\u0027 said Mr. Dempson. \u0027The haymakers are beginning to be about—a bad lot. Any scoundrel can use a scythe. Don\u0027t cry, old woman;\u0027 this to his wife, who was sobbing hysterically over the satin shoe. \u0027He was a nice young fellow, and we\u0027re all very sorry for him; but crying won\u0027t bring him back.\u0027 \u0027Such a happy day as we had with him!\u0027147 sobbed the leading lady. \u0027I never enjoyed myself so much, and to think that he should be m—m—murdered. It\u0027s too dreadful.\u0027 Nobody noticed Justina, till the thin straight figure suddenly swayed, like a slender sapling in a high wind, when Matthew Elgood darted forward and caught her in his arms, just as she was falling. Her face lay on his shoulder white and set. \u0027I\u0027m blessed if she hasn\u0027t fainted!\u0027 cried her father. \u0027Poor Judy! I forgot that he was rather sweet upon her.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t ought to have blurted it out like that,\u0027 exclaimed Mrs. Dempson, more sympathetic than grammatical. \u0027Run and get a glass of water, Dempson. Don\u0027t you fuss with her,\u0027 to the father. \u0027I\u0027ll bring her to, and take her home, and get her to lie down a bit. She shan\u0027t go on with the rehearsal, whatever Pyecroft says.\u0027 Pyecroft was the stage manager. \u0027She\u0027ll be all right at night.\u0027 Justina, after having water splashed over her poor pale face, recovered consciousness, stared with a blank awful look at her father and the rest, and then went home to her lodgings meekly, leaning on148 Mrs. Dempson\u0027s arm. A bleak awakening from her dream. Yes, it was all true. The gay, light-hearted lad, the prosperous lord of Penwyn Manor, had been taken away from the fair fresh world, from the life which for his unsated spirit meant happiness. Slain by a secret assassin\u0027s hand he lay in the darkened club-room of the \u0027Lowgate Arms,\u0027 awaiting the inquest. The Eborsham police were hard at work, but not alone. The case was felt to be an important one. A gentleman of property was not to be murdered with impunity. Had the victim been some agricultural labourer, slain in a drunken fray, some turnpike-man murdered for plunder, the Eborsham constabulary would have felt itself able to cope with the difficulties of the case. But this was a darker business, a crime which was likely to be heard of throughout the length and breadth of the land, and the Eborsham constable felt that the eyes of Europe were upon him. He knew that his own men were slow and blundering, and, doubtful of their power to get at the bottom of the mystery, telegraphed149 to Spinnersbury for a couple of skilled detectives, who came swift as an express train could carry them. \u0027Business is business!\u0027 said the Eborsham constable. \u0027Whatever reward may be offered by and by—there\u0027s a hundred already, by our own magistrates—we work together, as between man and man, and share it honourably.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s understood,\u0027 replied the gentlemen from Spinnersbury, the chief centre of that northern district. And affairs being thus established on an agreeable footing, the skilled detectives went to work. The watch and purse had been found by the local police before the arrival of these Spinnersbury men. The purse was empty, so it still remained an open question whether plunder had not been the motive. The man who took the money might have been afraid to take the watch, as a compromising bit of property likely to bring him into trouble. Higlett, one of the Spinnersbury men, went straight to the \u0027Waterfowl,\u0027 to hunt up the surroundings of the dead man. Smelt, his companion, remained in150 Eborsham, where he made a round of the low-class public-houses, with a view of discovering what doubtful characters had been hanging about the town during the last day or two. A race meeting is an occasion when doubtful characters are apt to be abundant; yet it seemed a curious thing that Mr. Penwyn, whom nobody supposed to be a winner of money, should have been waylaid on his return from the town—rather than one of those numerous gentlemen who had gone home from the Rooms that night with full pockets and wine-bemused heads. Mr. Higlett found the \u0027Waterfowl\u0027 people as communicative as he could desire. They had done nothing but talk about the murder all the morning with a ghoulish gusto, and could talk of nothing else. From them Mr. Higlett heard a good deal that set his sapient mind working in what he considered a happy direction. \u0027Smelt may do all he can in the town,\u0027 he thought, \u0027I\u0027m not sorry I came here.\u0027 The landlady, who was dolefully loquacious, took Mr. Higlett aside, having ascertained that he151 was a detective officer from Spinnersbury, and informed him that there were circumstances about the case she didn\u0027t like—not that she wished to throw out anything against anybody, and it would weigh heavy on her mind if she suspected them that were innocent, still, thought was free, and she had her thoughts. Pressed home by the detective, she went a little further, and said she didn\u0027t like the look of things about Mr. Clissold. \u0027Who is Mr. Clissold?\u0027 asked Higlett. \u0027Mr. Penwyn\u0027s friend. They came here together three days ago, and seemed as comfortable as possible together, like brothers, and they went out fishing together the day before yesterday, and then in the evening they brought home some of the play-actors to supper, the best of everything; and going up to bed they had high words. Me and my good man heard them, for the loud talking wakened us, and it was all along of some girl. And they were both very much excited, and Mr. Penwyn banged his door that violent as to shake the house, being an old house, as you may see.\u0027 152 \u0027A girl!\u0027 said Mr. Higlett, \u0027that sometimes means mischief. But there\u0027s not much in a few high words between two young gentlemen after supper, even if it\u0027s about a girl. They were all right and friendly again next morning, I suppose?\u0027 \u0027I dare say they would have been,\u0027 replied the hostess, \u0027only Mr. Clissold went out early next morning with his fishing-rod, leaving a bit of a note for Mr. Penwyn, and didn\u0027t come back till twelve o\u0027clock to-day.\u0027 \u0027Curious,\u0027 said Mr. Higlett. \u0027That\u0027s what struck me. Mr. Penwyn expected him back yesterday evening, and left word to say where he\u0027d gone, if his friend came in. Of course, Mr. Clissold was awfully shocked when he came in to-day and heard of the murder. I don\u0027t think I ever saw a man turn so white. But it did strike me as strange that he should be out all night, just that very night.\u0027 \u0027Did he tell you where he had been?\u0027 \u0027No. He went out of the house again directly with the police. He was going to telegraph to153 Mr. Penwyn\u0027s lawyer, and some of his relations, I think.\u0027 \u0027Ready to make himself useful,\u0027 muttered Mr. Higlett. \u0027I should like to have a look round these gentlemen\u0027s rooms.\u0027 Being duly armed with authority, this privilege was allowed Mr. Higlett. He examined bedchambers and sitting-room, looked at the few and simple belongings of the travellers, who were naturally not encumbered with much luggage. Finding little to employ him here, Mr. Higlett took a snack of lunch in the public parlour, heard the gossip of the loungers at the bar through the half-open door, meditated, smoked a pipe, and went out into the high road. He met Smelt, who seemed dispirited. \u0027Nothing turned up?\u0027 asked Higlett. \u0027Less than half nothing. How\u0027s yourself?\u0027 \u0027Well, I think I\u0027m on the right lay. But it\u0027s rather dark at present.\u0027 They went back to the inn together, conferring in half-whispers. A quarter of an hour later, Maurice Clissold returned from his mission. He looked pale and wearied, and hardly saw the two men whom he154 passed in the porch. He had scarcely entered the house when these two men came close up to him, one on each side. \u0027I arrest you on suspicion of being concerned in the murder of James Penwyn,\u0027 said Higlett. \u0027And bear in mind that anything you say now will be used against you by and by,\u0027 remarked Smelt.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2127/60213.html","bookId":486,"book":{"id":486,"title":"A Strange World","description":"简介： A fair slope of land in buttercup-time, just when May, the capricious, melts into tender Junea slope of fertile pasture within two miles of the city of Eborsham, whose cathedral towers rise tall in the blue dim distancea wealth of hedgerow flowers on...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
