{"id":39138,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. BEHIND THE SCENES.","content":"James Penwyn and Maurice Clissold went to the Eborsham Theatre as soon as they had eaten their dinner and smoked a single cigar apiece, lounging by the open window in the gloaming, talking over their afternoon\u0027s adventure. \u0027What a fellow you are, Jim!\u0027 cried Maurice, with a half-contemptuous, half-compassionate air, as for the foolishness of a child. \u0027To hear you go on about that scarecrow of a girl, one would suppose you had never seen a pretty woman in your life.\u0027 \u0027I never saw prettier eyes,\u0027 said James, \u0027and she has a manner that a fellow might easily fall in love with—so simple, so childish, so confiding.\u0027 \u0027Which means that she gazed with undisguised admiration upon the magnificent Squire Penwyn, of Penwyn Manor. A woman need only flatter you, Jim, for you to think her a Venus.\u0027 33 \u0027That poor little thing didn\u0027t flatter me. She\u0027s a great deal too innocent.\u0027 \u0027No, she only admired you innocently; opening those big blue eyes of hers to their widest in a gaze of rapture. Was it the locket, or the studs, or the moustache, I wonder, that struck her most?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be a fool, Clissold. If we are to go to the theatre, we\u0027d better not waste any more time. I want to see what kind of an actor our friend is.\u0027 \u0027Student of humanity,\u0027 jeered Maurice, \u0027even a provincial player is not beneath your notice. Cuvier was profound upon spiders. Penwyn has a mind of a wider range.\u0027 \u0027What is his name, by-the-bye?\u0027 mused James, thinking of Mr. Elgood. \u0027We don\u0027t even know his name, and we\u0027ve asked him to supper. That\u0027s rather awkward, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Be sure he will come. No doubt he has already speculated on the possibility of borrowing five pounds from you.\u0027 Mr. Penwyn rang the bell and gave his orders with that easy air of a man unaccustomed to count34 the cost. The best supper the \u0027Waterfowl\u0027 could provide, at half-past eleven. They walked along the lonely country road into Eborsham. The \u0027Waterfowl Inn\u0027 was upon one of the quietest, most obscure roads leading outside the city; not the great coach road to London, bordered for a mile beyond the town by snug villas, and band-boxical detached cottages—orderly homes of retired traders—but a by-road leading to a village or two, of no consequence save to the few humble folks who lived in them. This road followed the wind of the river which traversed the lower end of Eborsham, and it was for its vicinity to the river, and a something picturesque in its aspect, that the two friends had chosen the \u0027Waterfowl\u0027 as their resting place. There was a small garden behind the inn which sloped to the edge of the stream, and a rustic summerhouse where the young men smoked their pipes after dinner. Between the \u0027Waterfowl\u0027 and Eborsham the landscape was low and flat; on one side a narrow strip of marshy ground between road and river, with a scrubby brush here and there marking the boundary,35 on the other a tall neglected hedgerow at the top of a steep bank, divided from the road by a wide weedy ditch. The two friends entered Eborsham through a Gothic archway called Lowgate. The old town had been a strongly fortified city, famous for its walls, and there were several of these stone gateways. The theatre stood in the angle of a small square, almost overshadowed by the mighty towers of the cathedral, as if the stage had gone to the church for sanctuary and protection from the intolerance of bigots. Here Mr. Penwyn and Mr. Clissold placed themselves among the select few of the dress-circle, a cool and airy range of seats, whose sparsely scattered occupants listened with rapt attention to the gloomy prosings of \u0027The Stranger.\u0027 James Penwyn was not ravished by that Germanic drama. Even Mrs. Haller bored him. She dropped her h\u0027s, and expressed the emotions of grief and remorse by spasmodic chokings and catchings of her breath. But Mr. Penwyn lighted up a little when the Countess appeared, for the Countess had the large melancholy36 blue eyes of the girl he had met in the meadow. Miss Elgood did not look her best on the stage. Tall, slim, and willow-waisted, sharp of elbow and angular of shoulder, dressed in cheap finery, soiled satin, tarnished silver lace, murky marabouts, badly painted with two dabs of rouge that were painfully visible upon the pure pale of her young cheeks. Artistically, Justina was a failure, and feeling herself a failure suffered from an inability to dispose of her arms, and a lurking conviction that the audience regarded her with loathing. Mr. Clissold exchanged his front seat for a place on the hindmost bench before \u0027The Stranger\u0027 was halfway through his troubles, and here, secure in the shade, slept comfortably. James Penwyn endured two acts and a half, and then, remembering Mr. Elgood\u0027s offer to show him life behind the scenes, slipped quietly out of the dress-circle, and asked the boxkeeper how he was to get to the side scenes. That official, sweetened by a liberal donation, unlocked a little door behind the proscenium box, a door sacred to the manager, and let Mr. Penwyn37 through into the mystic world of behind the scenes. He would hardly have done such a thing under a responsible lessee, but in a commonwealth morals become relaxed. The mystic world looked dark and dusty, and smelt of gas and dirt, to the unaccustomed senses of Mr. Penwyn. The voices on the stage sounded loud and harsh now that they were so near his ear. There was hardly room for him to move between the side scenes and the wall—indeed, it was only by screwing himself against this whitewashed wall that he made his way in the direction which a scene-shifter had indicated as the way to the green-room. Mr. Penwyn\u0027s experience of life had never before led him behind the scenes. He had a vague idea that a green-room was a dazzling saloon, lighted by crystal chandeliers, lined with mirrors, furnished with divans of ruby velvet, an idealized copy of a club-house smoking-room. He found himself in a small dingy chamber, carpetless, curtainless, uncleanly, provided with narrow baize-covered benches and embellished with one cloudy looking-glass,38 on either side whereof flared an unscreened gas jet. Here over the narrow wooden mantelshelf hung castes of pieces in preparation, \u0027Jack Sheppard,\u0027 \u0027Delicate Ground,\u0027 \u0027Courier of Lyons,\u0027 \u0027Box and Cox,\u0027 a wide range of dramatic art, and calls for next day\u0027s rehearsal. Here, in divers attitudes of weariness, lounged various members of the dramatic commonwealth; among them Mr. Elgood, in the frogged coat, crimson worsted pantaloons and Hessian boots of the Baron; and Justina, seated disconsolately, with her limp satin trailing over the narrow bench beside her, studying her part in the piece for to-morrow night. \u0027My dear sir,\u0027 exclaimed Matthew Elgood, shaking hands with enthusiasm, \u0027this is kind! Dempson,\u0027—this to a gentleman in mufti, small, sallow, close-cropped, and smelling of stale tobacco—\u0027this is my pioneer of to-day. Mr. Dempson, Mr.?—stay, we did not exchange cards.\u0027 \u0027Penwyn,\u0027 said James, smiling. Mr. Elgood stared at the speaker curiously, as if he hardly believed his own ears, as if this39 name of Penwyn had some strange significance for him. \u0027Penwyn,\u0027 he repeated, \u0027that\u0027s a Cornish name isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027By Tre, Pol, and Pen you may know the Cornish men. There is nothing more Cornish; I was born and brought up near London, but my race belongs to the Cornish soil. We were indigenous at Penwyn, I believe, the founders and earliest inhabitants of the settlement. Do you know Cornwall?\u0027 \u0027Not intimately. Merely as a traveller.\u0027 \u0027Were you ever at Penwyn?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think so, I have no recollection.\u0027 \u0027Well, it\u0027s a place you might easily forget, not a promising locality for the exercise of your art. But you seemed struck by my name just now, as if you had heard it before.\u0027 \u0027I think I must have heard it somewhere, but I can\u0027t recall the occasion. Let that pass.\u0027 And with a majestic wave of the hand Mr. Elgood performed the ceremony of introduction. \u0027Mr. Dempson, Mr. Penwyn. Mr. Penwyn,40 Mr. Dempson. Mr. Dempson is our sometime manager, now a brother professional. He has resigned the round and top of sovereignty, and the carking cares of Saturday\u0027s treasury.\u0027 Mr. Dempson assented to this statement with a plaintive sigh. \u0027A harassing profession, the drama, Mr. Penwyn,\u0027 he said. \u0027The many-headed is a monster of huge ingratitudes.\u0027 James bowed assent. \u0027The provincial stage is in its decline, sir. Time was when this very theatre could be kept open for ten consecutive months in every year, to the profit of the manager, and when the good old comedies and the Shaksperian drama were acted week after week to an intelligent and approving audience. Now-a-days a man must rack his brains in order to cater for a frivolous and insatiable public, which has been taught to consider a house on fire, or a railway smash, the end and aim of dramatic composition. I speak from bitter experience. My grandfather was manager of the Eborsham circuit, and retired with a competency. My father inherited the competency,41 and lost it in the Eborsham circuit. I have been cradled in the profession, and have failed as manager, with credit to my head and heart, as my friends have been good enough to observe, some three or four times, and now hang on to dramatic art, \"quite out of fashion, like a rusty nail in monumental armour.\" That\u0027s what I call the decline of the drama, Mr. Penwyn.\u0027 James assented, and was not sorry that Mr. Dempson, having \u0027vented his woe,\u0027 went off to dress for the afterpiece. \u0027What a melancholy person!\u0027 said James. \u0027An excellent low comedian,\u0027 replied Mr. Elgood. \u0027You\u0027ll hear the people screaming at him in the \"Spitalfields Weaver\" by and by. His business with the tea and bread and butter is the finest thing I ever saw, not second to Wright\u0027s. Indeed,\u0027 added Mr. Elgood, as an after thought, \u0027I believe it is Wright\u0027s business.\u0027 \u0027Then it can hardly claim the merit of originality.\u0027 \u0027Genius, Mr. Penwyn, finds its material where it can.\u0027 42 \u0027Baron,\u0027 screamed a small boy, putting his head in at the door. \u0027My scene!\u0027 exclaimed Mr. Elgood, and vanished. James seated himself on the narrow bench beside Justina. \u0027I have been in the boxes to see you act,\u0027 he said, in that gentle winning voice which had made him a favourite among women. To Justina it sounded fresh as a voice from another world. No one in her world spoke like that, in tones so deferential, with accents so pure. \u0027I am very sorry for it,\u0027 said Justina. \u0027Sorry! but why?\u0027 \u0027Because you must hate me. The audience always do hate me. I feel it in their looks—feel it freezing me directly I go on the stage. \"Oh, there she is again!\" they say to themselves. \"Can\u0027t they manage to get through the piece without sending her on?\" \u0027What a curious notion! I thought actresses were conceited people.\u0027 \u0027Yes, when they are favourites.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know about the rest of the audience,43 Miss Elgood,\u0027 said James, almost tenderly, \u0027but I know I did not hate you,—my feelings leaned too much the other way.\u0027 Justina blushed through those two dabs of rouge—compliments were so new to her, and a compliment from this elegant stranger was worth all the loud praises of the vulgar herd. She hardly envied Miss Villeroy—the leading lady—whose chokings and sobbings in Mrs. Haller had been applauded to the echo, while the poor countess in her draggle-tailed sky-blue satin had walked on and off unnoticed. \u0027So this is the way you enjoy the legitimate drama, Mr. Penwyn,\u0027 said a sonorous voice—the full rich baritone of Maurice Clissold—and, looking up, James and Justina beheld that gentleman watching them from the doorway. \u0027I left you asleep,\u0027 replied James, abashed by his friend\u0027s advent. \u0027Yes, sneaked off, and left me to grope my way to this abominable den as best I could. I beg your pardon, Miss Elgood, but it really is a den.\u0027 44 \u0027You can\u0027t hate it worse than I do,\u0027 said Justina, \u0027or so badly—I have to sit here every night.\u0027 \u0027Poor child! It\u0027s a strange life—and a hard one. Seen from the outside there seems a not unpleasant Bohemian flavour about it—but when one comes behind the scenes the Bohemian flavour appears to be mainly dirt. I\u0027ve inhaled enough dust and escaped gas within the last ten minutes to last me comfortably for my lifetime. And you breathe this atmosphere for four or five hours every night! Poor child!\u0027 James sighed. His benevolent heart longed to rescue the girl from such a life—a girl with pensive violet eyes, fringed by darkest lashes—soft brown hair, so luxuriant that it made a crown of plaits upon the well-shaped head,—altogether a girl whom benevolence would fain benefit. \u0027Come, Jim,\u0027 said Clissold, who had a knack of reading his friend\u0027s thoughts, \u0027you\u0027ve seen enough of behind the scenes.\u0027 \u0027No, I haven\u0027t,\u0027 answered James, sturdily, as the countess ran off to act her part in the close of45 the play. He was wont to be plastic as wax in the hands of his guide, philosopher, and friend, but to-night there glowed a spark of rebellion in his soul. \u0027I am going to stop to see Mr. Elgood, and to ask him to bring his daughter to supper.\u0027 \u0027Bring his daughter! To visit two young men at a roadside inn?\u0027 \u0027Honi soit—,\u0027 said James. \u0027Can a girl be safer anywhere than with her father?\u0027 \u0027Look here, Penwyn,\u0027 said Clissold, earnestly, \u0027I\u0027ve made it the business of my life for the last two years to keep you in the straight path. I won\u0027t have you kicking over the traces for any blue-eyed chit in the universe. Remember what I promised your poor mother, Jim.\u0027 \u0027That you\u0027d act the part of an elder brother—supply the balance of good sense wanting to my shallow brains. That\u0027s all very well, Maurice. I always respected my poor mother\u0027s ideas even when they took the shape of prejudices. But a man must enjoy his life.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but he is bound to enjoy life with the least possible injury to other people.\u0027 46 \u0027Whom am I going to injure?\u0027 demanded Mr. Penwyn, with an impatient shrug, as he moved towards the wings. \u0027You are putting foolish ideas into that poor child\u0027s head.\u0027 \u0027What nonsense! Simply because I am civil to her. I mean to ask her to supper, whether you like it or not.\u0027 \u0027I hope her father will have the sense to refuse.\u0027 \u0027If you come to that, I\u0027ll invite the whole company!\u0027 cried the spoiled child of fortune. The curtain came down at this moment, and Mr. Elgood returned to the green-room, unbuckling his sword-belt as he came along. \u0027I waited to remind you of your promise to sup with us to-night, Mr. Elgood,\u0027 said James. \u0027My dear sir, it is not an engagement to be forgotten. I shall be there.\u0027 \u0027Will half-past eleven be too early?\u0027 \u0027No; \"The Stranger\" has played quick to-night, and the afterpiece is short. I shall be there.\u0027 \u0027Miss Elgood will accompany you, I hope?\u0027 47 \u0027Thanks, no. The proprieties would be outraged by her appearance at a bachelor\u0027s table. The only lady present.\u0027 \u0027We could easily remedy that, if any other lady of the company would honour us.\u0027 \u0027Upon my word you are very kind; and I know the child would consider it a treat. If you put the question in such a friendly manner I feel sure that Mr. and Mrs. Dempson would be delighted to join us.\u0027 \u0027Pray bring them. Is Mrs. Dempson also dramatic?\u0027 \u0027You have seen her to-night in one of her greatest parts—Mrs. Haller.\u0027 \u0027I thought the lady was a Miss Villeroy.\u0027 \u0027Her professional name, merely. Joe Dempson and Miss Villeroy have been united in the sacred bonds of matrimony for some years.\u0027 \u0027I shall be charmed to make the lady\u0027s acquaintance. You know your way to the \"Waterfowl?\" \u0027It is familiar to me as the path of my infancy.\u0027 \u0027And you\u0027ll be sure to bring Miss Elgood?\u0027 \u0027Judy shall come without fail.\u0027 48 \u0027Judy?\u0027 \u0027The pet name chosen by affection. She was christened Justina. Pardon me if I leave you hastily, I play in the next piece.\u0027 Mr. Elgood hurried away. James Penwyn glanced at his friend with the glance of triumph. \u0027Out of leading-strings, you see, Maurice,\u0027 he said. Maurice Clissold shrugged his shoulders and turned away with a sigh. James, more touched by silence than reproof, put his arm through his friend\u0027s with a gay laugh, and they went out of the green-room and out of the theatre together, arm-in-arm, like brothers who loved each other.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2127/60206.html","bookId":486,"book":{"id":486,"title":"A Strange World","description":"简介： A fair slope of land in buttercup-time, just when May, the capricious, melts into tender Junea slope of fertile pasture within two miles of the city of Eborsham, whose cathedral towers rise tall in the blue dim distancea wealth of hedgerow flowers on...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2127","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:51 AM"}}
