Marco grabbed his fists, hungNicky’s bound arms over his head and kissed him thoroughly. Nicky sagged against him. Marco spoke urgently in his ear as he bore him to the ground.\\n\\n When Nicky saw Marco thundering toward him, he had a sudden flashback to their first weeks together whenMarco’s wolf almost killed him by ripping out his throat. Even though his rational mind told him this was Marco in human form, and he’d never hurt him, he panicked. Instinctively, he raised his bound hands over his shoulder to strike. Marco came to an abrupt halt in front of him, catching both fists in his hands, and locked eyes with him.\\n\\n “Nicky? Do you want to fight me, baby?” Marco looped his arms over his head, bending to touch his lips gently to Nick y’s. At the first touch, Nicky surrendered, opening his mouth, greedily greetingMarco’s tongue as it swept over the inside of his mouth, searing him with a white hot heat. His own tongue met Marco’s and the old, familiar dance began. Love for this man swept over Nicky, and he sagged in Marco’s arms.\\n\\n Marco pulled his head back and whispered against his lips. “Forgive me, baby. I’ve been such a fool about everything.Just don’t leave me. Never leave me again, Nicky.I can’t live without you.”\\n\\n Nicky closed his eyes. Surely he was asleep and dreaming. Marco admitting he was wrong? Had to be a dream.\\n\\n “Please look at me, sweetheart. Rory told me how wrong I was—how unhappy you’ve been. Give me another chance to make it up to you.I swear I’ll try this time.”\\n\\n Nicky opened his eyes and looked into Marco’s beautiful dark ones, filled with pain. He opened his mouth to reassure him, but no words came out. For once in his life, he was speechless.\\n\\n Marco groaned.“Nicky, please. Don’t look at me like that. Things will change, honey. I promise.Will you go home with me and give me a chance to prove it to you?”\\n\\n Nicky licked his lips.“Uh—change how?”\\n\\n “I’ve been too protective, too controlling. I even spanked you. I’ll never do it again, Nicky, I swear. You can do whatever you want, wear whatever you want.I won’t boss you around like I did before.”\\n\\n “Okay, now I know I’m dreaming.”\\n\\n “No, baby, I mean it. I was trying to keep you safe and follow the old ways, but I see now I just drove you away.”\\n\\n “Untie me, Marco.”\\n\\n Contritely, Marco pulled Nicky’s arms from around his neck and untied Nicky’s wrists, kissing each of them before he released him. He dropped to his knees, pulling Nicky down with him and watched Nicky’s face. “What are you thinking, Nicky? Please don’t say you still want to leave me.”\\n\\n “No, I don’t want to leave, Marco. I love you too, but you’re right. Some things need to change.The human pets need better treatment, and you’re the only one who can make those changes.The wolves in your pack aren’t going to like it much. A lot of them are really set in their ways.”\\n\\n “I’ll handle them,” Marco said, setting his jaw.“If they don’t like it, they can leave. I won’t tolerate a challenge to my authority.”\\n\\n “I can handle a little bossiness. It’s a part of who you are. Just treat me as another adult, not your property and an empty-headed puppet. Okay?”\\n\\n “Okay, baby, so long as you talk to me when you get angry and don’t try to take off again. You have to be more careful. The Hunters would kill you, sweetheart, and until we defeat them, you’re not safe.”\\n\\n “I know that, Marco. I’ll be more careful and try not to worry you so much. There is one thing that’s not negotiable though.”\\n\\n Marco gave him a sharp look.“Okay, what is it?”\\n\\n “Those spankings in the bedroom. You’re not taking those away.”\\n\\n Marco threw back his head and laughed. “God, Nicky, you can always surprise me. Okay, sweetheart, I’ll see what I can do.” He took Nicky in his arms and hauled him over to sit in his naked lap.“I love you, Nicky, since the first minute I saw you.”\\n\\n Nicky settled himself over Marco’s rock hard cock.“The first time I saw you, I did this.” He leaned over and licked Marco’s chest, making him draw in a quick breath.“And a little of this.” He suckedon Marco’s nipple. “But most of all…” Sliding off his lap, he bent over Marco’s huge, rigid erection.“Iwanted to do this.” He licked at the head of Marco’s dripping cock and enveloped the shaft in his mouth, taking it right to the back of his throat. He pulled his tongue back up to the head and swirled a kisson the top. “So lie back, handsome, and let me show you who’s really boss.”\\n\\n Ian carried Logan straight through the falls and into the cave. He stripped his pants down to his knees without a word, pushed him to his back on the floor of the cave, and fell on him. Kissing him and ramming his tongue down his throat, he gagged Logan, backed off when Logan’s throat contracted, but still cut off his air. He let him take a quick breath only to thrust his tongue back, all the while grinding his huge, hardcock against Logan’s instantly rising erection. When Logan almost passed out from lack of oxygen, Ian finally raised his head and looked down into Logan’s stunned eyes.\\n\\n “You’re mine, damn you! I can’t make it without you! Understand?You’re not going to leave me, Logan.You can’t!”\\n\\n Logan tried to speak normally, but it came out a ragged whisper. Ian was so frantic and desperate he scared him a little. “Yes, yes, I’m yours. I understand.”\\n\\n Growling, Ian leftthe pants bunched around Logan’s knees and folded his legs up to his shoulders, lifting his ass in the air. He swiped precum from Logan’s cock, added his own, and smeared Logan’s hole, ramming inside, not giving Logan time to adjust to the force of his invasion.Logan couldn’t have fought him off if he wanted to. His hands were still tied, held over his head with one of Ian’s hands, and the pants around his knees proved as effective as rope. All Logan could do was wiggle, not to get away but to ease the pressure and spread his lower legs as far as he could to allow Ian’s body closer. Logan wanted Ian inside of him more than anything in the world, but at his choked back cry of pain, Ian froze a moment.\\n\\n Ian let Logan settle, his body and voice trembling. “I’m sorry, baby.”\\n\\n He gentled his movements, stroking instead of pounding like a pile driver and reached Logan’s prostate with every stroke. Logan soon purred under him like a kitten.\\n\\n “That’s right, baby. You like that,don’t you?” His large hand enveloped Logan’s cock. “That’s mine too. All mine. I hope you like it a lot, darlin’, ’cause you’ll be getting it every night. Scream my name, baby. Tell me who you love.” He stroked against Logan’s prostate again.“Who, baby? Who do you love?”\\n\\n “Ian!”\\n\\n “That’s right. Scream it again!”\\n\\n Ian made him scream out again and again until Logan’s throat was raw. Matching the squeezing pulls of his hand to the strokes of his cock, Ian drove Logan out of his mind. On the bridge of climax, Ian’s hand slipped to squeeze the base of Logan’s cock.\\n\\n “Ian, please.”\\n\\n Ian bit his wrist andthrust it into Logan’s mouth.\\n\\n “Feed from me, little one. I won’t let you come until I fill you full of my blood. I can’t lose you again.”\\n\\n After what seemed like hours of teasing, his cock pulsing like thunder for release, Ian finally pulled his wrist away. He pulled free,ignoring Logan’s cry of dismay, bent down, and whispered in Logan’s ear as he rolled him to his stomach, pulled his ass up, and pushed his knees under him. “Time for the gland again, to remind you who you belong to.”\\n\\n Logan moaned, his knees moving in reflex to crawl away, remembering the pain of that knot pushing into him. The next thought was of the incredible orgasms that followed. His first efforts at escape stilled and Ian laughed, using one arm around his hips to pull him back hard, impaling him again on his cock, the knot pressing for entrance. Both arms around Logan’s hips, Ian ground against him, working the knot in. Logan pushed back and out, clenching his hands in fists in the dirt and biting his lip. The knot slipped through, still the size of a baseball, but he’d been broken in enough that it was easier to take it in than it had been the first time. The pressure hit his prostate, and Logan cried out in pure ecstasy. He screamed when Ian bit his neck. No fangs pieced his flesh, but the sensation was the same, intensified pleasure. Logan climaxed, unable to hold back a second longer. He pumped his seed onto the floor of the cave and Ian came, filling him full of his cum, spreading him full of warmth, and triggering another climax. Three or four climaxes later, Logan lost count going in and out, as they continued to rack his body until pure exhaustion put him out for good.\\n\\n He woke with his head inIan’s lap. The last coherent memory he had was the huge gland, stretching him until he thought he would rip apart and the incredible pleasure afterward, one climax following another until he thought he’d go mad. He was naked, no surprise, and had a blanket covering him. His hands were still tied, which confused him a little, but he didn’t question. Ian rested his back against the wall of the cave, idly stroking Logan’s cock.\\n\\n Logan struggled to sit up, and Ian pushed him back down.\\n\\n “Lie still. I’m not through with you yet. For the rest of your thirtyday sentence you’ll stay naked and mostly inmy lap when I’m home. If I’m gone, I’ll tie you to the bed. Marco can do what he wants with Nicky, but I’m not going to risk losing you again.”\\n\\n “No, no,” he insisted, slurring his words with sleep. “I have to talk to you. I have to tell you—”\\n\\n “Hush. Go back to sleep.I don’t want to hear any more out of you. I’m still angry over your running away from me and asking for asylum. Asylum!” His tone was bitter and disgusted. “When that son-of-abitch hit you with his gun, I thought I’d lose my mind. I could barely keep it together to get rid of the three we lured away. I don’t want to ever feel like that again.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/logan-s-choice-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-3/page-26.html","bookId":2255,"book":{"id":2255,"title":"Logan\u0027s Choice (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #3)","description":"Storyline: Logan\u0027s Choice (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #3) \\n As the beta of the Dark Hollow Wolf Pack, Ian is supposed to be the calm, sensible one, but when a young Hunter is captured, his overpowering attraction to the gorgeous man has him acting way out of character. \\n As a sworn enemy to the wolf pack, the captive can’t be allowed to go free, yet the pack hates to keep Logan imprisoned.
