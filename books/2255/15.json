He looked around the room in uncertainty until his eyes fell on Casey and the look of hostility on his face. He frowned, thinking nothing good was going to happen, but looked down, not challenging him by holding his gaze. Ian cleared his throat, and immediately Logan raised his head and started over toward him. Before he reached him, the door opened behind him. Nicky and Rory entered. Logan stopped and stared at the newcomers.\n Recognizing who was who wasn’t difficult. Nicky, dressed in tight black leather pants, had golden hair tucked in curls behind his ears. He gave everyone a big smile as he came in, looking around the room with interest. When he spotted Marco at the head of the table his smile grew even wider, and he sauntered over to him to plop down on the chair arm next to him and twined his arm around his neck. Marco laughed indulgently and leaned up to kiss him with a possessive air. Logan was shocked as he watched them. Rory followed in a more sedate manner, walking over to stand beside Casey’s chair, as befit the dignity of a wolf. He did squeeze Casey’s hand when he offered it, his only acknowledgement of their bond.\n Ian watched Nicky with a strangely wistful look. A sharp stab of some unfamiliar emotion ran through Logan. He didn’t want Ian looking at anyone like that. Ever. Nicky was beautiful—there was no other word to describe him. Oddly, though he hung all over Marco, he didn’t look gay at all, if there was such a look. He was lean, but muscular and had a manly swagger with nothing feminine in his movements. Everything Logan had ever been taught on the subject of homosexual love was topsy-turvy. Watching the men openly express their affection only made him feel worse. He walked over to Ian and touched his shoulder. He was rewarded with a warm smile, but he still had a funny feeling in the pit of his stomach.\n Marco gave Nicky a quick kiss as he stood and let Nicky slide down into his chair. He addressed the others at the table. “I thought our mates could have a little talk together tonight over dinner. Nicky, in particular, has some insights he can share with Logan about the necessity for feedings. And Rory has some experience as a new mate who had some difficulty settling in. Nicky and I would like to invite you all over for dinner tonight.”\n Ian smiled and nodded, as did Casey, and that seemed to be that, leaving Logan full of resentment. What if he didn’t want to have dinner tonight with these two seriously gorgeous guys, one of whom Ian seemed to be more than a little interested in?Didn’t matter apparently. It seemed to be a done deal.\n As they left, Ian took Logan’s hand and led him down the hallway and up the stairs to their apartment. “I have some exciting news, Logan. Marco has agreed with our plan. He’s made a few changes, like he and Casey want to goalong, but he’s agreed to let me take you with us.”\n “Yeah, good.” Logan’s voice was low and uninterested.\n Entering their rooms, Ian turned to face him. “What’s the matter, honey?Don’t you feel well?I thought you’d be excited by the news.” “Why did you agree to dinner tonight with all of them? I have no interest in getting to know Nicky and Rory.”\n “Why, Logan?They’re both very nice and can help you a lot. Nicky in particular, is—”\n Logan broke in, throwing himself down on the sofa. “Is what?Oh, I’m sure you think he’s just great. Nicky is perfect, isn’t he? I saw how you were looking at him. I’ve noticed how your face lights up whenever you talk about him. You probably wish he was yours, don’t you? All that curly blond hair, all that hanging all over his master like a dog begging for attention.”\n Ian laughed out loud.“It’s obvious you don’t know Nicky very well if you think he considers Marco his master.”\n Logan frowned.“Yeah, but he belongs to your alpha, so there’s not much you can do about your obvious attraction to him, is there?Guess that’s why you settled for me. It’s not like I’m your blood match, after all. But hey, any old port in a storm, right?”\n Ian’s jaw dropped. He sat beside Logan on the sofa, twisting to face him. “Are you crazy?Is that what’s wrong, Logan? You’ve lost your mind all of a sudden?”\n Logan crossed his arms over his chest and turned his head away. “I saw how you looked at him. You don’t have to pretend.”\n Ian threw back his head and laughed. “Oh my God, you’re jealous! You’re jealous of Nicky!”\n Logan pressed his lips together and shot him a dark look. “Of course not, don’t be silly. I’ve never been jealous of anyone in my life. Certainly not another man!”\n “So you wouldn’t mind if I sat next to Nicky tonight at dinner?”\n Logan gave him an evil look. “If you want to have to sleep with one eye open, go right ahead.”\n Still laughing, Ian lifted Logan over into his lap, and wrapped his arms around him to make him stay there. “Not jealous, huh? Settle down, please! Let me talk to you.”\n Logan still tried to push away. “I’m not jealous! If you like Nicky and his girly blond curls, go ahead. Makes no difference to me.”\n Ian forced his head around and kissed him to shut him up. Logan fought, but Ian held him effortlessly until Logan was out of breath and gave up. Only then did Ian relax his hold and trail kisses down his throat and onto his chest. “Why would I want a blond when I’ve got a sultry, sexy brunet? Do you ever look in the mirror, baby?You’re gorgeous!”\n “Then why did you look at Nicky with that expression on your face?”\n “What expression?”\n “Like you wished it was you Nicky was draped all over!I saw your face, so don’t try to deny it!” Logan almost spat the words in his anger.\n Ian shook his head sadly. “It wasn’t like that, baby. It wasn’t Nicky I wanted. It was to have that kind of relationship with you.”\n Logan shot up and walked into the kitchen. “I can’t be that kind of man, Ian. It doesn’t mean I don’t care about you.”\n “I know.”\n “Do you?” he said, turning around to look at Ian. “Do you, really?Because you don’t sound like you know.”\n “I know you have strong feelings for me, Logan, but—”\n “But what, damn it?”\n “Logan, we’re not a blood match. You have feelings for me because of the chemistry from the mating bite. It had to be that way. For me, it was different. I wanted you from the first minute I saw you. It’s a love match for me. I hope that one day—”\n Logan yelled at Ian, shaking with fury. “So now you’re telling me how I feel? You think I would let you—do the things you do, if I didn’t—damn it!I’m not attracted to any man except you. I never have been.I don’t want you looking at anybody else. Anybody else, you got that?”\n “I got it.” Ian held out his hand, but Logan pointedly ignored it and flopped in the chair opposite Ian. He kept his arms folded, but he unbent a little.\n “Now what were you saying about Marco allowing me to go with you to the munitions warehouse?” Logan asked, all business.\n “Uh, well, he said he and Casey wanted to go with us, but he will allow you to go too.”\n “Good. When do we leave?”\n “We didn’t discuss that yet. I’d like to try right away. We’ll have to inform the council.”\n “Can you do that tomorrow?We’ve already wasted too much time.”\n “I’ll talk to Marco and Casey tonight.”\n “Good. Let me know what they say, because I won’t be there.”\n “Logan.”\n “No. I’m not in the mood. Unless you think I’m being feral and want to force me.”\n Ian considered his answer, long enough for Logan to think he was going to insist. He breathed out a small sigh of relief when Ian said, “No, Logan. Ifyou don’t want to go, then you don’t have to.”\n “Good. I’m going to turn in early and read. Wake me up when you get home. If you want to.” Logan rose to his feet and walked with determination to the bedroom, leaving Ian gazing after him with a puzzled expression.\n Chapter Five\n Ian and Marco discussed the matter with the council, and they reluctantly agreed. They were concerned about all of their leaders being captured at once, but finally accepted Marco and Casey’s determination to go.\n Two days later, they started out early in the morning. They drove to a safe spot as close to the isolated compound as they could and took a long hike in the rest of the way, certain the private road into the two hundred acres would be monitored. Ian carried Logan part of the way since he couldn’t keep up with the wolves’ supernatural speed. The compound, surrounded by a high chain link fence, was situated at the top of a flat crested hill close to the boundaries of the Nantahala National forest, the same forest which edged their land on a different side. At one end of the compound was the warehouse, a metal building approximately a hundred feet long and forty wide. At the other end, in a rough semi-circle, a long flat building comprised of quarters, cells, infirmary, interrogation rooms, and field offices. Other smaller buildings were for storage of supplies. A guard house, lit up on the inside by the dim flickering of a television, was located at the front next to a heavy steel gate..\n When they arrived well after dark on the mountainside overlooking the compound, the wolves had a hurried conference. They separated into two groups. Marco and Casey went to the perimeter of the compound, watching for any stray guards or Hunters who might be wandering around in the area. Ian turned away with a nod and motioned for Logan to follow him down the rough terrain and thick forest.\n Ian and Logan picked up their gear and moved down through the night toward the fence. With the wire cutters Ian carried, they were soon inside the compound. In silence, they kept to the shadows and joined in with the darkness. Ian was jittery. Things were almost too quiet. Ian tried to shake it off as his imagination. He knew in a tense situation, especially at night, and especially when he had to worry about another man\u0027s safety, his imagination could get the better of him. The fear factor multiplied until he could begin to see things really not there and hear things all in his mind. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/logan-s-choice-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-3/page-15.html","bookId":2255,"book":{"id":2255,"title":"Logan\u0027s Choice (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Logan\u0027s Choice (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #3) \n As the beta of the Dark Hollow Wolf Pack, Ian is supposed to be the calm, sensible one, but when a young Hunter is captured, his overpowering attraction to the gorgeous man has him acting way out of character. \n As a sworn enemy to the wolf pack, the captive can’t be allowed to go free, yet the pack hates to keep Logan imprisoned.
