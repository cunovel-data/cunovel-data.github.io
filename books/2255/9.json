I’ll leave right now, and you won’t have to see me again.”\\n\\n “No!” Logan wasn’t sure if he said it outloud or not, but the idea of Ian’s leaving him slammed through him like a freight train. He hadn’t realized until this moment how dependent he was on this big wolf, how much he needed him. More, how much he wanted him. Still, how could he say he wanted this wolf to fuck him? The idea was unthinkable. It was ludicrous. It was as exciting as hell.\\n\\n He shook his head miserably. “II can’t-can’t say it.”\\n\\n Ian made a harsh growling sound and paced back and forth again. His big, muscular body oozed sexuality. “If I can’t make love to you, I’ll have to leave tonight. I’ll come back, but I can’t…I won’t be able to…damn it!I can’t stay here and not claim you as mine.”\\n\\n He stopped in front of Logan and tore off his own clothing, standing before Logan naked, his big body gorgeous as his tense muscles flexed. His huge hard cock dripped precum, jutting out in front of him, almost touching Logan’s lips.\\n\\n “Tell me you don’t want me then. Say the wordsand I’ll leave you alone.”\\n\\n “I-I…” Logan dropped his gaze, shaking his head. “Please.”\\n\\n “Please what? Say the words, Logan, if you’re so sure you don’t want me.”\\n\\n “I-I do want you, okay?I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I want you so much it’s tearing me apart!”\\n\\n “So say the words! Ask me to make love to you.” Ian made another low growl in his throat.“I can’t–I won’t force you, now any more than I did before. I don’t want to intimidate you into it either, damn it, but I love you, and I want you. If you want me, please say the words and put me out of this misery.”\\n\\n Logan fought against everything he’d ever been taught, ever believed about himself, in a losing battle. He wanted this man, plain and simple. No matter how it had started, he loved him, and he needed him like he needed to breathe. He raised his faceto Ian’s, bit his lip, and looked at his lap. “Ian, would you…would you make love to me?”\\n\\n In one step, Logan reached the bed and kissed him hard. Trembling with desire, he swiped Logan’s pants off and tossed them.“Up on your knees, honey.”\\n\\n Logan scrambled up as fast as he could, but before he could even get all the way up, Ian was on him, spreading his legs wide and putting one hand on his back to hold him in place. Taking his cock in his hand, he painted Logan’s hole with his dripping pre-cum. Without another word, he buried his cock as deep inside as he could in a single, hard plunge. Logan tried to pull his forehead out of the mattresswhere the force of Ian’s impalement drove him and catch his breath for the searing pain. Ian must have thought he was trying to get away. A slap landed on Logan’s ass. The breath rushed out of Logan’s lungs, his eyes opened wide. Still he found himself squirming within Ian’s hold, desperate for even more. Did he like the pain? It had almost taken his breath away, but Ian inside him made him so hot, he was about to combust.\\n\\n Buried deep inside Logan, Ian held still, allowing Logan to relax a bit and his body to accept his size before he rocked back and thrust hard inside him again and again. Logan grunted with each unyielding, punishing ram of the hard cock up his ass. This was about possession, pure and simple, and even rough, Logan reveled in it. He wanted to belong to this man, body and soul.\\n\\n Ian pounded hard in him, yet with each stroke, Ian hit the spot inside him that was pure pleasure. Ian’s hand closed on Logan’s cock and stroked it hard. He yanked at his penis, pulling him forward, and pushed him back on the downward stroke, meeting the slamming from behind. Logan felt like a boneless rag doll being pulled back and forth, helpless, yet controlled. He was powerless against the orgasm ripping through him with such force he yelled out Ian’s name. Ian continued to milk him for every drop until it became almost painful.\\n\\n Ian came too, surging in him and forcing him down even further into the covers. Ian’s heavy body bore him down to the sticky mattress, totally covering him with rough skin and hard muscle. He whispered in Logan’s ear. “Mine.” He bit him again, not a mating bite, but a love bite, marking his territory. Logan knew when he looked in the mirror he would see a full set of teeth marks. Ian sucked on the side of his neck over and over, raising small blood blisters and further marking him as belonging to him. “You’re mine,” he growled again.\\n\\n Without enough breath to answer, Logan nodded his head. Ian rolled off him, pulling Logan along with him on top of his body. Logan crawled up, nestling his nose into the hollow between Ian’s throat and his shoulder. After a few moments, Ian began to breathe more evenly, and Logan tried to slip down beside him. Immediately, Ian pulled him back, growling at him softly. Logan settledhimself on top of Ian’s body as comfortably as he could, since he apparently was there for a while. It was hard to go to sleep with his cock rubbing against Ian’s hard abs. His cock refused to stay soft.\\n\\n Sighing and settling down as much as he could, he contented himself with rubbing himself gently against Ian, as Ian idly played with his ass. Despite all the stimulation, he relaxed enough to follow Ian down into sleep.\\n\\n Logan awoke alone the next morning, but he could hear the shower running, and Ian humming softly to himself. He swung his legs over the bed and padded into the bathroom. Almost timidly, he opened the door. “I-I have to go to the bathroom. Mind if I come in?”\\n\\n “Go ahead.” Logan relieved himself and, ducking his head, walked back toward the door. The shower door opened, blocking his way, billows of steam escaping out into the bathroom around him.\\n\\n “Get in, baby.”\\n\\n Not stopping to think, Loganstepped inside and was immediately enveloped in Ian’s arms. Wordlessly Ian rubbed soap on his body, wiped away the sticky crusts of their love making and soothed the sore spots. Ian soaped Logan’s cock gently and slowly, turned him around, and took care of the backside as well. With Logan’s knees weakened and starting to bend, Ian put his arms around him and held him close. He kissed him tenderly, rubbing his hardness against him. His hands roamed over his body. He didn’t make love to him, only washed him tenderly, and helped him dry off when he was done.\\n\\n Afterwards, Logan wrapped a towel around his waist and followed Ian into the kitchen, watching him quietly as he made coffee.\\n\\n Ian smiled at him. “We missed supper last night, and I’m starving. We’ll go down in a minute, but first I want some coffee. I’d like you to learn to do this. Do you know how to make coffee?”\\n\\n Looking at the old fashion percolator Ian used, Logan shook his head. “Not with that. Why?Do I need to learn?”\\n\\n “I think it’s a good idea if we both know how. We can eat our meals downstairs in the cafeteria most of the time, but I’m picky about my coffee. I usually have a cup up here before I go down. It’s a ritual my wife and I started a long time ago.”\\n\\n “Your wife?”\\n\\n “Yes, Logan. She died over five years ago. Her name was Maria, and she was beautiful.”\\n\\n “I thought you’re gay?”\\n\\n Ian shook his head. “Logan, wolves don’t use that term—at least it doesn’t mean much to us, though we understand what humans mean by it. I’m neither straight nor gay. Something in our blood usually picks our mates, males for some, females for others.”\\n\\n Logan was quiet for a long moment. He felt something gnawing at his mind, something he hadn’t experienced before, jealousy, pure and white hot. He shifted uncomfortably on his chair. “Is that what I was? Did your blood pick me?”\\n\\n “No. I picked you. We have only one blood match. It’s strong, but it doesn’t mean we can’t love someone else if our blood mate dies.”\\n\\n “You picked me. Just like that.”\\n\\n “Yes.”\\n\\n “You never even saw me before you came down to the basement cell. How did you even know about me?”\\n\\n “Marco told me if someone didn’t turn you, they would have to execute you. We couldn’t let you go free, and it was obvious you wouldn’t have stayed with us willingly because of the state of mind you were in.”\\n\\n “Oh, so I’m a pity case, is that it?”\\n\\n “The first time I saw you was in that cell, so brave and fierce, coming up to the cell door and baring your teeth. You weren’t afraid of anything. I didn’t feel pity for you, Logan. I wanted to make love to you.”\\n\\n Logan squirmed uncomfortably on the chair. Ian’s eyes burned as they looked at him, and he was very aware of his bare body. Ian and the feelings he aroused confused him so much he didn’t know if he was coming or going.\\n\\n “What about you, Logan? What did you think when you first sawme?”\\n\\n He lifted one shoulder in a shrug. “Just another big wolf coming to look at me like I was something to eat.” He shrugged again, admitting, “Handsome. I thought maybe you were picking out which part you wanted to eat first.”\\n\\n “Oh, I was,” Ian said with a smile, walking over to him and bending down to kiss him lightly on the lips. “I definitely was.”\\n\\n Logan blushed, pulling away, and Ian laughed and pulled him up to stand beside him. He ran his hands down to cup his ass. “Damn, if I wasn’t so hungry,I’d skip breakfast and just concentrate on you.”\\n\\n “Stop. I’m not into all that.” Logan felt himself blushing like a damn girl.\\n\\n “You don’t even know what you’re into. You’re so uptight about your sexuality. Why can’t you just relax?”\\n\\n “I’ve never been with a man before.I don’t even know what I’m supposed to do.”\\n\\n “There aren’t any rules, baby. There’s no one here to judge you. It’s just you and me. I like you to walk around naked in our rooms, and I like looking at you. Get used to it, because I plan on making love to you often. Actually, every chance I get.” He patted his ass fondly and went back to pour a cup of coffee. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/logan-s-choice-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-3/page-9.html","bookId":2255,"book":{"id":2255,"title":"Logan\u0027s Choice (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #3)","description":"Storyline: Logan\u0027s Choice (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #3) \\n As the beta of the Dark Hollow Wolf Pack, Ian is supposed to be the calm, sensible one, but when a young Hunter is captured, his overpowering attraction to the gorgeous man has him acting way out of character. \\n As a sworn enemy to the wolf pack, the captive can’t be allowed to go free, yet the pack hates to keep Logan imprisoned.
