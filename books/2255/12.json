Hell, yeah he would, and Logan shoved the thoughts out of his head for the meeting. Ian and the big alpha sat together at the table talking quietly when he walked into the main room. They both turned to look at him. Ian smiled at him and held out his hand. Logan walked over to stand beside him, and let him take his hand, pulling him into the chair beside him. Marco, the alpha, smiled at him too. “Hello, Logan. How are you feeling?” “Fine.” He resisted leaning into Ian the way his body wanted to automatically. He may as well be a magnet and Ian steel. “What can you tell us about The Hunters?” “Well, I know there are a lot of us—them. Maybe a thousand throughout the Blue Ridge Mountains. More on the west coast. My father is the leader. It’s been a kind of hereditary thing in our family for generations. The leadership always goes to the oldest son.” “Are you his oldest son?” “His only son.” Ian and Marco gave each other a lookLogan couldn’t read, making him curious. “What can you tell me about your training?” Marco asked. Logan began to talk, detailing the six months of physical and combat training, telling them everything he knew, including the scent dampeners the Hunters’ scientists had developed and how long it lasted. He told them where the training took place, who conducted it, and when the next training was scheduled to begin. He told them where the nearest compound was and of the warehouse there the Hunters used to store their munitions, and gave them information on who the leaders were. In short, he told them everything they needed to know about the east coast operation, even drew them maps. “That’s closer than I thought it’d be,” Marco commented, looking at the map. “Less than a two or three hour drive from here.” “Now we know why we’ve been seeing more of them,” Ian said, concern etched in his features. Logan sagged, drained after talking for over an hour. The entire time he talked he suffered a split sensation, one part standing outside of himself, looking on in horror, watching in disbelief while this other part of him spilled his guts. Ian, always aware of his feelings, covered his hand and bent down to him. “Are you all right?” he asked. “I-I think so. I just can’t shake this feeling I’m a traitor.” “They lied to you, Logan, about what we are,” Ian said to comfort him. Marco leaned forward. “Don’t think of it as being a traitor, Logan. The information you gave us is very valuable and may save many innocent lives. I can promise you we are not the aggressors here. We will do nothing to jeopardize our way of life and our secrecy from the general public. We only want to be left alone. We’ll defend ourselves if necessary, but we don’t attack humans.” “What about the human pets like me?Where did they come from?” Ian spoke from beside him. “There aren’t any like you, Logan. Yours was a special case. We did the most humane thing we could think of and that was to make you one of us. The other pets who are here are all blood matches to their wolves. There aren’t many of them, really—only about a dozen, including the alpha’s pet. Each one of them wants to be here with their mate.” “Isn’t that because you bite them and cloud their minds? Make them believe they want things they don’t want? Like me?” Marco spoke again. “Are youbeing forced to do things you don’t want, or are you free to do what you know is right? Are you unhappy with us, Logan? Do you not want to be here?” “No!” He glanced at Ian. “I mean, no I want to be here, but I feel compelled to be and have to wonder if that’s because of me or because of what you did to me? Why do I have to drink blood anyway?Can’t I let my mind clear and see how Ifeel?” Ian and Marco exchanged another glance. Logan got the feeling he was hurting Ian and leaned into him. Ian immediately put an arm around him. His touch calmed Logan right away, and he sagged a little, suddenly tired after his tirade. Marco stood up. “When you’re feeling stronger, I’d like you to meet my mate, Nicky. I wasn’t able to court him properly and give him the choice before the Werekin bite either. He was attacked by muggers and would have died without the bite. He felt very much like you do when he first came to us, confused and angry. He didn’t understand why I made him do certain things, and he resented it. He’s a very strong-willed person, and he went without feeding for longer than anyone has in recent history. It almost killed him, Logan. We don’t want to put you at risk the same way. You’re having a harder time because of your training and background, but we can’t stop your feedings. Ultimately, they’re for your own good and will help you be healthy and strong. You have to trust us, Logan. We have only your best interests at heart.” “Yeah, I’ve heard that before.” “That’s because it’s true,” Ian said firmly. He stood up and walked with Marco to the door. “Thanks for coming, Marco. I’ll see you later at the council meeting.” Ian returned to Logan at the table. “You should eat something. Do you want me to take you downstairs?” “No, I’m not really hungry.” He looked up at Ian. “What will they do with the information I gave them? Will they attack the Huntersnow?” “I’m really not sure what we’ll do, but we won’t attack. You heardMarco. We aren’t the aggressors. You’ve given us a lot to absorb. We’ll talk about it at council and decide.” He hesitated, his reluctant obvious.“Logan, I have to tell you Marco has finally been in touch with your father.” “What?” “He knows we have you.” “What did he say? Did you tell him what you did to me? Tell me.” Ian took the message out of his pocket. “We didn’t tell him much of anything. It was delivered by a third party who didn’t know we’d given up on any negotiations, or that I’d taken you for my mate.” Heput a hand over Logan’s while Logan read a scribbled note. We have Logan. Release possible with terms. Below that in a different handwriting, one Logan recognized as his father’s, was the answer. No man would allow himself be captured or stay alive if he was. He is dead to me. Dispose of the body as you will. Logan pulled his hand from under Ian’s and stood. “I’m going to lie down for a while.” “This has hurt you.” “Fuck him!He wasn’t there. How the hell does he know anything?” He ran his hand through his hair.“Shit, maybe he’s right. Maybe I should have killed myself rather than let myself be captured.” “It doesn’t make you less of a man, Logan. You fought fiercely. The wolves all spoke of it.Don’t do this to yourself.” He moved to enfold Logan in his arms. “No,” Logansaid, pushing at his chest. “Just leaveme alone for a while.” “When you hurt, I hurt.” Ian wouldn’t let go, and Logan erupted, pulling Ian’s shirt open with one rip of his hands, buttons flying. He went after Ian’s pants next, jerking them open, peeling them down his legs, and pushing him to his back on the floor, all in one action. Ian looked surprised, but didn’t struggle against him, letting him do what he wanted with him. He had Ian’s cock in his mouth before Ian’s big body settled. Ian made no protests, not until Logan jerked his own pants open, twisting to line his cock up with Ian’s hole. “Logan, I’ve given you some leeway, knowing you’re upset, but…” “Please,” Logan begged, hooking his arms under Ian’s knees. “Please.” With only a moment’s hesitation, Ian relaxed and let him push his legs up, raising his ass in the air. Logan’s trembling fingers swiped pre-cum from both their cocks, smeared Ian’s hole, and plunged in. His hips pumped into Ian with only one objective. Ian’s cock was only half-hard, reacting to the unfamiliar position and pain.Logan put his hand on Ian’s cock, pulling at it. “Come for me,” he cried out“Come for me, Ian.” He stroked at him harder and harder, causing Ian to moan and twist with pleasure. Ian came, shooting strong, thick streams of cum over his own belly and chest. Logan followed, groaning his release, grinding intoIan’s ass, and ended in a sob. The frenzy finished, he crawled up Ian’s body, nestled his forehead against Ian’s neck and wept. “Let’s talk about how to take them out .” Ian looked at Logan in surprise. “Honey, I know you’re angry.” “I’m more than just angry. The bastard never wanted me in the first place.” He snorted, looking at his clenched fist. “His idea of sex was to fuck them and leave them, a lesson, he claimed, he learned after my mother slammed a paternity suit on him. He used prostitutes after that while he looked for the woman worthy of carrying his heir. I never saw him until I was ten, after he got himself infected with disease and found out he’d never father another child. He tried to take me then, but my mother wouldn’t let him near me. She died six months later in a car wreck.” “Do you think—?” “He killed her? I wouldn’t put it past him. I know once he got his hands on me, he swore he’d train out all the soft weakness she’d taught me. I don’t want to talk about him anymore.” “I understand, but it’s a little soon for you to be switching sides and talking about taking the Huntersout, isn’t it?” Logan shoved up and stalked to the window to stare out at the woods beyond. Ashamed of his earlier break down, he was equally grateful Ian hadn’t mentioned it. Once he quieted downafter learning he truly didn’t mean anything to his father, Ian took them to the shower, bathed them, and helped him dress. Fully aware of the concession Ian made on his part to sootheLogan’s shattered soul, itwasn’t, as far as Logan was concerned, going to make their relationship any easier. Now Logan was indebted to him for even more.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/logan-s-choice-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-3/page-12.html","bookId":2255,"book":{"id":2255,"title":"Logan\u0027s Choice (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #3)","description":"Storyline: Logan\u0027s Choice (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #3) As the beta of the Dark Hollow Wolf Pack, Ian is supposed to be the calm, sensible one, but when a young Hunter is captured, his overpowering attraction to the gorgeous man has him acting way out of character.
