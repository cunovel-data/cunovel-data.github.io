He wanted the man’s beautiful cock, standing up so long and thick from a mass of dark curls. He wanted nothing more than to taste it, lick it, and suck it like an ice cream cone, and shuddered. Where were these thoughts coming from? He shook his head as if to clear it, but it didn’t help. He still wanted nothing more than his fingers around the man’s cock. He touched, and the big man smiled down at him. He even patted him on the head. Would he let him taste it, too? Not even caring if the others watched, Logan put out his tongue and licked the enticing cock from the strange donut of flesh at the base to the tip. The big man gasped aloud and the pat on his head went to a clench, pulling his hair. He didn’t pull Logan away, and Logan went back for more.\n He spoke softly to the others. “I can handle him from here.” His voice sounded hoa rse. “Thanks for your help. I think I need to take care of him right away.”\n They nodded and moved away, leaving them alone together. Logan was desperate to get to his cock and thrilled when his beautiful man lay down beside him and gathered him in his arms. His man?\n “No,” the voice in the back of his head whispered. “It’s wolf, an animal. You want nothing to do with it.”\n Logan didn’t want to hear. He wanted to listen to the man beside him.\n “My name is Ian, and I want to mate you now. Do you understand?” He held Logan’s face between his hands and shook him slightly. “Concentrate. You aren’t too far gone to say no if you don’t want this. I’m going to mate with you. Sex. You’ve studied our customs. You know what that means. Do you understand?”\n Logan nodded his head. He understood and though he’d never before wanted another man, he wanted this one. Wanted him so badly his hips already moved, his own cock rigid with need. He put his hand down to it and stroked himself, pulling at it as he gazed at the man. Ian, what a beautiful name. He tried it on his tongue. “Ian,” he said softly, and the big man smiled.\n “That’s right, baby. Last chance before we start. Do you agree to mate with me?” Logan nodded again. “You can stop it if you want to, but only to a certain point. Once we reach that point, I won’t be able to stop. Understand?”\n Logan’s head bobbed up and down eagerly. “Yes. I want you. Your body is…” He licked his lips and tried to express what he was feeling. “I think your body is amazing.” Puzzlement nagged at him. “I’m not gay. I never wanted this before, but…”\n Ian smiled at him tenderly and kissed the tip of his nose. Logan’s doubts melted away.\n “Your body is amazing too, and sometimes the body knows better than the conscious mind. You want me, you want this, or your reaction wouldn’t be so strong,” Ian told him. “What’s your name, sweetheart?”\n “L-Logan.”\n “Just Logan?”\n “Logan Winters,” he murmured, cuddling closer to Ian, trying to get his nose up in Ian’s neck. He vaguely remembered there was some reason he never wanted to tell these men, these wolves, his full name, but he no longer cared. This man-wolf smelled so damn good.\n Logan’s mind seemed to be almost split, with one large part of him trying to practically climb inside this beautiful man, and the other minuscule part standing back in amazement and confusion, telling him again he wasn’t gay and reminding him that this was a wolf, a monster, his enemy, and not a man.\n All he could think about was sucking the big man’s cock. He’d always believed in the past that wolves were bad. Wolves were freaks, abominations of nature, evil. The confused part of him didn’t care, not anymore, not with the way the man looked into his eyes, not with what he saw there. He trusted this man with his life. It was unreasonable, and he knew that with a distant part of his mind, but the feeling was also true and he knew it.\n “Your name is Logan Winters? Are you any relation to Elias Winters, baby?”\n Logan nodded, frowning. His voice turnedbitter. “Yes,” he said, still trying to get closer. “He’s my father.”\n Ian drew back and smiled down at him. “Your father? Really?”\n His voice had a surprised tone. Why was that? God, did he know his father? He pushed the idea away. He raised his gaze and saw the gorgeous man waiting patiently for his answer, his warm, dark eyes approving of him, admiring him, encouraging him, and he felt a little thrill run through him. He wanted to please him more than anything.\n “Yes, he’s my father.” He hated his father, didn’t want to think of him. He wanted the man lying next to him and put a hand around the back of his neck to pull him down.\n “Sweetheart, let me explain something to you. Once we mate, you will belong to me. We’ll be together forever. You’ll never be alone. It will be my job to take care of you, protect you, and make sure you’re happy. Can you focus on that for just a minute?”\n Logan nodding vigorously again. “Sure.” Belong to him. Protect him and make him happy. How nice it would be to belong to someone who cared.\n Ian chuckled softly. “You’re in heat, honey. I’m going to make love to you now and that should ease you some. Lie on your back, sweetheart.”\n Eagerly Logan lay down, though he couldn’t pull his hands away. His hips moved in anticipation, and he pulled again at his own cock. Ian gently pushed Logan’s legs apart and knelt between them. He tapped Logan’s hands and smiled teasingly.\n “Uh-uh. That’s mine, baby. Let me take care of you.”\n Logan’s hand fell away, and his breathing quickened. He clutched at the sheet beneath him, grabbing handfuls of it and thrust his hips upward. Ian bent and took the head of his cock in his warm mouth, swirling his tongue over the broad tip, licking at the drops of precum, before sticking his tongue right down into the slit. Logan’s hips almost bucked off the bed. Ian caught him and pushed him back down. Holding him effortlessly, he bent again and took the whole length of Logan’s cock into his mouth, made his cheeks hollow and sucked him right to the back of his throat.\n Logan couldn’t hold back and shot his load, his hips straining against the big hands holding him down, driven to fuck hismouth. Ian sucked his cum down, sucking until he’d milked him for every drop and licking up the softening shaft to drop a kiss on the head.\n “Beautiful, darling, you’re responding beautifully.” He moved his hands so they stroked up and down his sides. “Roll over on your stomach, baby.”\n Logan eagerly rolled over, still breathing hard but hoping against hope Ian would put that magnificent cock up inside him. He had no experience with cocks in his ass, either big or small, but he was so eager to have Ian’s he squirmed and twisted his ass in invitation.\n “We’re going to take this slow, baby. It will hurt because you’re so tight, but just keep pushing out, and if you need me to stop, tell me. I’ll be able to stop for a little while, but probably not for long, okay?”\n Something cold spread up the crevice between his cheeks and on his virgin entrance. Looking back over his shoulder, he watched Ian caressing him with some kind of oil, pushing in and out of his hole with his fingertip.\n “This oil will help you, sweetheart. It has a numbing ingredient so this won’t hurt so badly.”\n Logan sucked in a breath and hunched at the unaccustomed sensation when the thick finger slid inside him, then relaxed, pushingback against it. Ian’s finger reached inside his ass and explored gently. The new sensation set his hips pumping the mattress. Ian chuckled and put a hand on his lower back to hold him still. His finger, when a second joined the first, burned at first, and then Ian hooked his fingers and touched a spot. Logan squealed in surprised delight. What the hell was that? It almost made him come again, and he’d never been able to come again so quickly or have his cock spring back up so soon after he had. He looked back over his shoulder and Ian smiled at him.\n “That was your prostate, baby. Did you like that?”\n He touched it again. Logan moaned even louder and fought to hump his hips. Ian’s big hand wouldn’t let him. Nothing larger than a doctor’s finger sheathed with a rubber glove had ever been inside him, and despite the desire running through his body, he felt a momentary unease. He’d never felt anything like it before, and tensed again when a third finger slipped inside him. Too much, yet he seemed to want what was happening desperately. Still he was frightened whenthe tip of Ian’s huge cock nudged up to his hole and Ian pushed slowly, steadily against the barrier of his tight hole’s ring of muscle.\n “Up on your hands and knees, sweetheart. It’ll make it easier. Push out, Logan. It will help you take me in.”\n Did he want this man, this wolf, inside him? God, yes, he wanted him! Was it wrong? Yes, the distant voice in his head cried. It’s unnatural. Logan ignored the voice, casting it away.\n Logan pushed out as directed and soon the crown of the big cock slid through, easing the pressure somewhat. Deeper and deeper the cock went, filling Logan until he thought his ass would rip wide open. Still his insane body wanted more. Ian moved gently, back and forth, in and out, deeper each time, all the way in. The last time his heavy balls grazed Logan’s ass. Logan’s groans filled the room, half pain, half pleasure. Stretched to receive Ian as far as he thought he’d ever be able to go, it burned terribly. Still the discomfort eased as his body adjusted.Even more, Ian thrilled him, satisfying a need he hadn’t even known he’d had. A rhythm set up, driving Logan wild. Every time the man—wolf, the inner voice cried—Ian, the stronger voice countered—came close to the special spot and touched it, Logan was swept away in rapture. His own dick went rigid again, painfully so, and he moved his hand to clench it, give it a fist to fuck. Ian blocked his hand.\n “No, sweetheart. That’s mine, now. I’ll take care of you. Understand?”\n Logan nodded, accepting the idea, making him feel so helpless yet so owned. His own body didn’t belong to him anymore. He was Ian’s. Why was that exciting to him? He thought he might come anyway, but Ian squeezed the base of his dick between his forefinger and thumb. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/logan-s-choice-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-3/page-4.html","bookId":2255,"book":{"id":2255,"title":"Logan\u0027s Choice (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Logan\u0027s Choice (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #3) \n As the beta of the Dark Hollow Wolf Pack, Ian is supposed to be the calm, sensible one, but when a young Hunter is captured, his overpowering attraction to the gorgeous man has him acting way out of character. \n As a sworn enemy to the wolf pack, the captive can’t be allowed to go free, yet the pack hates to keep Logan imprisoned.
