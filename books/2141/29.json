{"id":95735,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\"Keep the squares tight!\" Banak Brawnanvil yelled to his forces - his depleted forces.\\n\\n Not only had attrition begun to take a real toll on the dwarf defenders, but Banak had several dozen of his dwarves off the lines and working with Nan-foodie. They were further securing the pieces of metal tubing that were running from the tunnels beneath Keeper\u0027s Dale all the way up the side of the cliff face. That left the dwarf warlord fighting defensively, warding the newest vicious attack, but withholding any counterstrikes.\\n\\n Banak\u0027s dwarves were holding well and would continue to hold, as far as the orcs were concerned. But the dwarf warlord kept glancing to his left, to the northwestern ridge and the giants busily completing the assembly on their great catapults. Every so often, a flash of white from the far ridge caught Banak\u0027s attention. Reports from his scouts said that Nanfoodle\u0027s stink was thick around the behemoths, crawling up through the rocks and settling like a fetid yellow cloud upon the ridge. But to Banak\u0027s dismay, that discomfort hadn\u0027t driven the giants away. They had wrapped their large faces in treated cloth and had methodically continued, and were continuing, their work.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re running out o\u0027 time, Banak,\" came a voice from the side.\\n\\n The warlord turned to regard Ivan Bouldershoulder.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll hold them back,\" Banak replied.\\n\\n \"Bah, them orcs\u0027re nothing,\" said tough Ivan. \"But the little trickster\u0027s trick ain\u0027t working. By yer own eyes, ye can seem them giants still at their work. Catapults\u0027ll be up and throwin\u0027 before the sun\u0027s next rising. From that angle, they\u0027ll flatten us to the stone.\"\\n\\n Banak rubbed his bleary eyes.\\n\\n \"We might want to be dropping down to the dale,\" Ivan offered.\\n\\n Banak shook his head.\\n\\n \"Little one\u0027s still working on it,\" he huffed. \"I\u0027ve got a hunnerd dwarves working with him.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s only securing the line, from what I\u0027m hearing,\" Ivan countered.\\n\\n He motioned for Banak to follow and started off to the west, toward the line of dwarves hanging along the cliff facing down to Keeper\u0027s Dale. They came in sight of Nanfoodle and Ivan\u0027s brother in short order, standing atop the cliff, looking over reams of parchments and diagrams. Every so often, Nanfoodle would lean out a bit and holler down the line, telling the dwarves to re-tar the joints - all the joints.\\n\\n \"This\u0027ll make the smell so bad them giants can\u0027t stay up?\" Banak asked when he and Ivan neared the pair.\\n\\n Nanfoodle looked up at him, and the blood drained from the clearly worried gnome\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Easy, little one,\" Banak offered. \"Yer stink\u0027s slowing them at least, and we\u0027re grateful to ye for that.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re not even supposed to smell it!\" Nanfoodle shouted.\\n\\n \"Ptooey!\" Pikel spat in agreement.\\n\\n Ivan looked at his brother and shook his head.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not supposed to be stinking up the ridge,\" Nanfoodle tried to explain. \"That means that the hot air ... the pitch was supposed to seal the tunnels . . . we need to build this level of concentration . ..\"\\n\\n He stammered and stuttered and held up a sheet parchment scribbled with numbers and formulae that Banak couldn\u0027t begin to decipher.\\n\\n \"Ye got what he\u0027s saying?\" Banak asked Ivan.\\n\\n \"Giants shouldn\u0027t be stinking,\" Ivan clarified.\\n\\n \"But then they\u0027d be building their war engines without any hindrance at all,\" the warlord reasoned.\\n\\n \"Yup,\" Ivan agreed.\\n\\n \"But then . ..\" Banak started, but he stopped and shook his head.\\n\\n He gave Nanfoodle a confused look out of the comer of his eye, then shook his head again as he looked down at the many dwarves working on securing the line of metal tubes tight to the cliff - dwarves who could have been strengthening the defensive squares that were even then holding the line against the pressuring orcs.\\n\\n With a snort, Banak moved back toward the area of battle.\\n\\n \"No, he doesn\u0027t understand,\" Nanfoodle pleaded to Ivan.\\n\\n The yellow-bearded dwarf patted his gnarled hands in the air to calm the little one.\\n\\n \"And he never will,\" Ivan replied.\\n\\n \"The stink should not have escaped,\" Nanfoodle frantically tried to explain.\\n\\n \"I know, little one,\" Ivan assured him.\\n\\n \"Boom,\" Pikel quietly muttered.\\n\\n \"We needed to contain it, to thicken it...\" Nanfoodle pressed.\\n\\n \"I know little one,\" Ivan interrupted, but Nanfoodle rambled along.\\n\\n \"The stench would never push them away - in the tunnels, maybe, where the concentration is greater .. .\"\\n\\n \"Little one,\" Ivan said, and when Nanfoodle rambled on, he repeated his calm call again and again, until finally he caught the excited gnome\u0027s attention.\\n\\n \"Little one, I built yer box,\" Ivan reminded him.\\n\\n He patted Nanfoodle on the shoulder, then hustled after Banak to help direct the battle.\\n\\n Ivan glanced to the west as he departed, not to the ridgeline, but beyond it, where the sun had set and the twilight gloom was completing its hold on the land. Then he did lower his gaze to encompass the ridgeline and the dark silhouettes of the great working giants.\\n\\n Ivan knew that their troubles would multiply before the next rising sun.\\n\\n \"The dwarves\u0027 plans did not work, boss,\" one of the orc undercommanders said to Urlgen.\\n\\n The pair as standing in the center of the two armies at Urlgen\u0027s command: his own, which was continuing the battle up the slope against the dwarves; and those on loan from his father, who were still encamped and out of sight of their enemies.\\n\\n Urlgen was looking to the west, to the ridge and the giants. The hourglass was flowing on the battle, as word had arrived from Obould that the assault in the west would begin in full at dawn. For Urlgen, that meant that he had to push those dwarves over the cliff, and doing that would be no easy task without the giant catapults.\\n\\n \"They will be ready,\" the orc undercommander remarked.\\n\\n Urlgen turned to face him.\\n\\n \"The dwarves and their stink have not stopped the giants,\" the undercommander asserted.\\n\\n Urlgen nodded and looked back to the west. He had assurances from the giants that the catapults would begin their barrage before the dawn.\\n\\n Back in the north, the battle continued, not in full force, for that was not Urlgen\u0027s intent, but strongly enough to prevent the dwarves from retreating in full. He had to keep them there, engaged, until his father sealed off any possible escape.\\n\\n The orc leader issued a low growl and curled his fists up at his side in eager anticipation. The dawn would bring his greatest victory.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t help but glance back nervously at the western ridge as he considered that without the giant catapults, his task would be much more difficult.\\n\\n Nikwillig rolled the small mirror over and over in his hands. He glanced to the west and the ridge, then to the east and the taller peaks. He focused on one smaller peak at the edge of the cliff, a short but difficult climb. That was where he had to go to catch the morning rays. Returning from that place, should Banak lose, would prove nearly impossible.\\n\\n \"What am I hearing?\" he heard Tred call to him, drawing him from the unsettling thought.\\n\\n Nikwillig observed the swift approach of his Citadel Felbarr companion.\\n\\n \"What am I hearing?\" Tred demanded again, storming up right before the seated Nikwillig.\\n\\n \"Someone\u0027s got to do it.\"\\n\\n Tred put his hands on his hips and looked all around at the continuing bustle of the encampment. He had just come back from the fighting, dragging a pair of wounded dwarves with him, and he meant to get right back into the fray.\\n\\n \"I was wondering why ye weren\u0027t with us on the line,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m more trouble than help down there, and ye know it,\" said Nikwillig. \"Never been a warrior.\"\\n\\n \"Bah, ye were doing fine!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not me place, Tred. Ye know it, too.\"\\n\\n \"Ye could\u0027ve gone running back to King Emerus then, with news,\" Tred answered. \"I bid ye to do just that - was yer own stubbornness that kept us both here!\"\\n\\n \"And we belong here,\" Nikwillig was quick to reply. \"We\u0027re owing that much to Bruenor and Mithral Hall. And to be sure, they\u0027re glad that Tred was up here fighting beside them.\"\\n\\n \"And Nikwillig!\"\\n\\n \"Bah, I ain\u0027t killed an orc yet and would\u0027ve been slain more than once if not for yerself and others pulling me out o\u0027 the fight.\"\\n\\n \"So ye\u0027re choosin\u0027 this road?\" came the incredulous question.\\n\\n \"Someone\u0027s got to do it,\" Nikwillig said again. \"The way I\u0027m seeing it, I might be the most expendable one up here.\"\\n\\n \"What about Pikel?\" Tred asked. \"Or the durned gnome Nanfoodle - yeah, was his crazy idea in the first place.\"\\n\\n \"Pikel probably can\u0027t even make the climb with his one arm. And Nanfoodle might be needed here - ye know it. Pikel, too, since he\u0027s been so important to it all so far. Nah, Tred, shut up yer whining. This\u0027s a good job for meself and ye know it. I can do this as well as any, and I\u0027ll be the least missed here.\"\\n\\n Tred started to argue, but Nikwillig rose up before him, his stern expression stealing the blustery dwarf\u0027s words.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m wanting to do it,\" Nikwillig declared. \"With all me heart and soul. Now I\u0027m paying back the Battlehammers for their help.\"\\n\\n \"Ye might find a tough time in getting back. In getting anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"And if that\u0027s true, then yerself and all them standing here will have hard a tough time of it, too,\" said Nikwillig. He gave a snort and a sudden burst of laughter. \"Yerself\u0027s about to charge down headlong into a sea of smelly orcs, and ye\u0027re fearing for me?\"\\n\\n When he heard it put that way, Tred, too, gave a little laugh. He reached up and patted his longtime companion on the shoulder.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not liking that we might be meeting our ends so far apart,\" he said.\\n\\n Nikwillig returned the pat, and the look, and said, \"Nor am I. But I been looking to make meself as helpful as can be, and this job\u0027s perfect for Nikwillig.\" Again, Tred started to protest - reflexively, it seemed - but again, Nikwillig cut him short.\\n\\n \"And ye know it!\" Nikwillig said flatly.\\n\\n Tred went quiet and stared at his friend for a long moment, then gradually admitted as much with a hesitating nod.\\n\\n \"Ye be careful.\"\\n\\n \"Are ye forgetting?\" Nikwillig replied with a wink. \"I\u0027m knowing how to ran away!\"\\n\\n A shout from down the slope caught their attention then. The orcs had breached the dwarven line right between the two defensive squares - not seriously, but enough to put a few of the bearded folk in apparent and immediate danger.\\n\\n \"Moradin, put yer strength in me arms!\" Tred howled, and he charged headlong down the slope.\\n\\n Nikwillig smiled as he watched his friend go, then he turned back to the east and the dark silhouettes of the imposing mountains. He glanced back one more time to take his bearings and to better mark the critical area of the mountain spur, then, without another word, he tucked the mirror safely into his pack and trudged off on what he figured would be the last journey of his life.\\n\\n Several hours later, the sky still dark but the eastern rim holding the lighter glow of the approaching dawn, word filtered up to Banak that an orc force had been spotted in the southwest, fast approaching the dwarf positions on the western edge of Keeper\u0027s Dale. The dwarf quickly assembled his leaders, along with Nanfoodle, Pikel, and Shoudra Stargleam, who had been the bearer of the information, having scouted the western reaches personally with her magical abilities.\\n\\n \"It is a sizable force,\" Shoudra warned them. \"A great and powerful army. Our friends will be hard-pressed to hold out for very long.\"\\n\\n The dispiriting news had all the dwarves glancing around to one another.\\n\\n \"Are ye saying that we should ran down the cliff now and be done with it?\" Banak asked.\\n\\n Shoudra had no answer to that, and Banak turned to Nanfoodle.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m hoping to steal a victory here,\" he explained. \"But we\u0027re not to do that if them giants start throwing their boulders across our flank. It comes down to yer plan, gnome.\"\\n\\n Nanfoodle tried to look confident - futilely.\\n\\n \"If we gotta leave, then we gotta leave,\" Banak said to them all. \"But I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 we need to hurt these pig orcs, and bad.\"\\n\\n Thibbledorf Pwent growled.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re coming soon,\" Ivan Bouldershoulder put in. \"They\u0027re stirring in the north, getting ready for another charge.\"\\n\\n \"Because they know the giants will soon begin their barrage,\" Wulfgar reasoned.\\n\\n \"But if them giants ain\u0027t throwing. ...\" Banak said slyly.\\n\\n Again he turned to Nanfoodle, guiding the eyes of all the others to the gnome as well.\\n\\n \"Oo oi!\" Pikel cheered in support of the hunched little alchemist.\\n\\n \"Is it gonna work?\" Banak asked.\\n\\n \"Oo oi!\" Pikel said again, punching his one fist into the air.\\n\\n \"The smell was not supposed to .. .\" Nanfoodle started to reply, but then he stopped and took a deep breath. \"I do not know,\" he admitted. \"I think...\"\\n\\n \"Ye think?\" Banak berated. \"Ye got more than a thousand dwarves up here, little one. Ye think? Do we hold the fight or get down now?\"\\n\\n Poor Nanfoodle had no idea how to answer and couldn\u0027t begin to take that heavy responsibility upon his tiny shoulders.\\n\\n \"Oooi!\" cried Pikel.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s gonna work,\" Ivan added.\\n\\n \"So we should stay?\" Banak asked.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s yer own choice to make,\" Ivan replied. \"But I\u0027m thinking them giants\u0027re gonna be wishing we\u0027d turned tail and run!\"\\n\\n He stepped over and patted Nanfoodle on the shoulder.\\n\\n \"Oo oi!\" cried Pikel.\\n\\n \"Orcs\u0027re coming again,\" said another dwarf, Rockbottom the cleric. \"Big charge this time.\"\\n\\n \"Good enough. I was gettin\u0027 bored!\" said Thibbledorf Pwent, who was already covered in blood and gore from the evening\u0027s fighting - some of it his own, but most of it that of his unfortunate enemies.\\n\\n \"Dawn\u0027s another hour away,\" Ivan remarked.\\n\\n \"Less than that from Nikwillig\u0027s perch, if he got there,\" said Catti-brie.\\n\\n \"We got to hold then,\" Banak decided.\\n\\n He turned to Nanfoodle and nodded, as much a show of support for the gnome\u0027s outrageous scheme as he could muster at that grim time. Banak was gambling a lot, and he knew it, and so did everyone else around him. With the giants throwing their boulders and the press of the orcs, the dwarves would have a difficult time getting over that cliff face and down to Keeper\u0027s Dale. If Shoudra\u0027s reports and assessment were correct, getting down to Keeper\u0027s Dale might prove to be the least of their problems and the worst of their decisions.\\n\\n \"Drive them back, Thibbledorf Pwent,\" Banak instructed. \"Ye hold them pigs off us.\"\\n\\n In response, Pwent held up a bulging wineskin, tapped it to his forehead in salute, and ran along to join his bloody and battered Gutbusters.\\n\\n All eyes again went to Nanfoodle, who seemed to shrink under the press of those concerned gazes. His plan had to work, but the signs were not promising.\\n\\n Soon enough, the sounds of battle again echoed up the slope as Pwent led the dwarves\u0027 counterassault.\\n\\n Soon after that, the sounds of another battle echoed up from below, from the western reaches of Keeper\u0027s Dale.\\n\\n And soon after that, the first of the giant catapults let fly. A huge boulder smashed and bounced across the back edge of the dwarven line, right along the cliff face.\\n\\n \"Ye got yer skins?\" Thibbledorf Pwent asked his gathered Gutbusters as they circled back up and regrouped. To a dwarf, they produced the bulging bladders. \"Some o\u0027 ye won\u0027t be needing them,\" he added solemnly. \"And might be that some won\u0027t be able to get to them, but ye know yer place!\"\\n\\n As one, the Gutbusters cheered and roared.\\n\\n \"Get in and break their lines,\" the fierce dwarf instructed. \"Drive them back and take yer dead place!\"\\n\\n Down went the force, another furious charge that slashed through the orc ranks. No defensive measure there, Pwent led his forces down the slope farmer than any dwarves had previously gone, shattering the orc line and their supporting allies. Their goal was to cause more confusion than actual damage - no easy mind set for the carnage-hungry Gutbuster Brigade - and that\u0027s what they did.\\n\\n The orc assault fell apart, with many forced to turn back and retreat before regrouping.\\n\\n Thibbledorf Pwent kept his formation tight, not allowing the customary Gut-buster pursuit. He raised his waterskin in salute and reminder to the others. Then he found a broken weapon he could later use, offering a wink to those nearby so they would understand his intent.\\n\\n Like an ocean tide, the orcs rolled back and gathered strength for the next wave. And during that brief lull, more of the giant catapults began heaving huge boulders through the predawn sky. Few had the range at first, and so the initial volleys were not so effective, but all the dwarves understood how quickly that might all change.\\n\\n \"We got to hold the east!\" Tred cried at the others, mostly to Wulfgar, who had pretty much been anchoring that end of the line from the very beginning.\\n\\n Wulfgar looked at him grimly, and that response alone quieted the Felbarr dwarf, reminding him of what he had known all along: that Nikwillig would have a hard time getting back to them.\\n\\n Banak paced nervously around the cliff ledge, looking down to the southwest as often as he was looking at the raging battle down the slope to the north.\\n\\n This is it, he thought.\\n\\n It was the culmination of all his efforts and of all of his enemies\u0027 efforts. The orcs were closing their vice, north and west, as the giants were softening up the rear of Banak\u0027s position.\\n\\n A boulder slammed down not so far away and bounced right past Banak, nearly clipping him off the cliff.\\n\\n The tough dwarf didn\u0027t flinch, just continued his pacing, his eyes more and more going to the brightening eastern sky.\\n\\n \"Come on then, Nikwillig of Felbarr,\" he whispered, and even as he spoke the words, he saw the flash of a distant mirror, catching the first rays of dawn on the other side of the eastern ridge.\\n\\n Others noted the same thing, some pointing excitedly to the east. Catti-brie came running Banak\u0027s way from the east, bow in hand, as did Nanfoodle, Shoudra, and Pikel, coming in fast from the west.\\n\\n \"Sight it, sight it,\" Shoudra coaxed quietly, watching the distant mirror.\\n\\n Nanfoodle clenched his hands before him, hardly drawing breath.\\n\\n \"There!\" Catti-brie said, pointing to the ridge, where the reflection of Nikwillig\u0027s roving sunbeam at last caught a second mirror, turning it to blazing brilliance. The woman lifted her bow.\\n\\n Banak held his breath, as did the others.\\n\\n Below them, the battle raged, orcs swarming up the slope in greater numbers than before. An all-out assault, it seemed, and all around their position came the calls for retreat, even some terrified shouts for the dwarves to retreat all the way, to get down to Keeper\u0027s Dale.\\n\\n \"What\u0027re we doing, then?\" Catti-brie asked, glancing, as were all the others, over at Nanfoodle.\\n\\n Nanfoodle began to huff and puff, unable to catch his breath, and for a moment it seemed as if he would simply fall over. He glanced over to regard Pikel, who was sitting next to the tubing near one wide joint.\\n\\n Nanfoodle found strength in that image, in the giddy confidence of the green-bearded dwarf.\\n\\n The gnome took a deep breath and nodded to Pikel.\\n\\n \"Oo oi!\" Pikel Bouldershoulder cried.\\n\\n The druid waved his hand over the stone that joined the tubes, then pressed against the suddenly malleable stone, crushing it flat and sealing off the flow.\\n\\n Another deep breath and another gulp, and Nanfoodle forced himself to steady.\\n\\n \"Shoot straight!\" he yelled, and he whimpered and cast himself aside.\\n\\n Catti-brie leveled Taulmaril, sighting in the shining mirror - the reflector Ivan had placed on the side of the box that had been set in the ridge.\\n\\n More giant boulders crashed down - several dwarves cried out in terror as the great rocks smashed across the dwarven line.\\n\\n Catti-brie pulled back, but the eastern mirror held by distant Nikwillig shifted a bit and the reflector in the ridge went suddenly dark.\\n\\n The woman held her posture, held her breath, and held her bow ready.\\n\\n \"Breach!\" came the cry of a dwarf from below and to the north.\\n\\n \"Shoot it, then!\" Banak implored her.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t breathe and didn\u0027t let fly, waiting, waiting, trusting in Nikwillig. She saw his reflected sunbeam crawling around the dark stones of the ridge, seeking its target.\\n\\n \"Come on then,\" Shoudra whispered. \"Sight it.\"\\n\\n Banak ran away from them.\\n\\n \"Fall back!\" he yelled down to those engaged in battle. \"Form a second line!\" he cried to those reserves up nearer to the cliff - reserves who were scrambling around, trying to find cover from the increasing catapult barrage.\\n\\n Catti-brie put it all out of her mind, holding herself perfectly still and ready, and focusing on that reflected sunbeam - only on that crawling line of light.\\n\\n There came a flash in the darkness of the western ridge.\\n\\n Taulmaril hummed, the silver-streaking arrow soaring out across the many yards. The woman fired a second and a third off at once, aiming for the general area.\\n\\n She needn\u0027t have bothered, for that first shot had struck the mark, smashing through the glass of the mirror, then driving home into the piece of wood set in place behind it. The force of the blow drove the wood back, collapsing the large vial and the enchanted and explosive oil burst to life.\\n\\n For a brief instant, nothing happened, then ...\\n\\n BOOM!\\n\\n All the west lit up as if the sun itself had leaped out from behind that ridge. Flames shot out from every crack in the mountain spur, side, and ceiling, jumping up past the stunned giants and their great war engines, leaping higher than any flames any of the awestricken onlookers had ever seen. A thousand feet into the air went the orange fires of Nanfoodle, turning night to daylight and carrying dust and stone and huge boulders high into the sky with them.\\n\\n The flames lasted only a brief instant, the gasses burning themselves out in one concussive blast, and the onlookers gaped and gasped. And a hot wave of shocking force rolled over them, over Catti-brie, Shoudra, and Nanfoodle, over squealing Pikel and wide-eyed Banak, over the battling warriors, dwarf and orc alike, throwing them all to the ground.\\n\\n Within that hot wave of air came the debris, tons and tons of stones small and large sweeping across the battlefield slope. Since the main reaches of the slope were farther to the north, the orc hordes took the worst of it, with hundreds laid low in a single burst of power.\\n\\n Back in the west, the ridge, once so evenly distributed, seemed a jagged and torn line. Catapults and giants alike - those few that were still somehow in place - were aflame, the war engines falling to pieces, the behemoths leaping wildly about.\\n\\n Nanfoodle pulled himself off the ground and stood staring stupidly to the west.\\n\\n \"Remember that fireball you described to me from your visit to the mage faire those years ago?\" he asked the equally stricken Shoudra.\\n\\n \"Elminster\u0027s blast, yes,\" the stunned woman replied. \"The greatest fireball ever thrown.\"\\n\\n Nanfoodle snapped his little fingers in the air and said, \"Not any more.\"\\n\\n \"Oo oi!\" Pikel Bouldershoulder squealed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lone-drow-hunter-s-blades-2/page-29.html","bookId":2141,"book":{"id":2141,"title":"The Lone Drow (Hunter\u0027s Blades #2)","description":"Storyline: The Lone Drow (Hunter\u0027s Blades #2) \\n Alone on the battlefield. \\n Surrounded by death. \\n Cornered by enemies. \\n And ready to die. \\n Drizzt Do’Urden has become the Hunter, the bane of the orc hordes still ravaging the North.
