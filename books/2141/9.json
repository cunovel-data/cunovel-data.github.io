{"id":95715,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Drizzt stared hard at the elf who had just spoken his name. A flicker of recognition teased the drow, but it was nothing tangible, nothing he could hold onto. \"We have some salves that might help with your wound,\" the elf offered. He took a step forward - and Drizzt backed away an equal step. The elf stopped his approach and held up his hands. \"It has been many years,\" said the elf. \"I am pleased to see that you are well.\" Drizzt couldn\u0027t completely suppress his wince at the irony of that statement, for he felt anything but \"well.\" The reference that he had met the elf before had his thoughts shifting away from that, however, as he tried hard to place the speaker. He had known few surface elves in his years out of the Underdark. Not many were in Ten-Towns, though Drizzt hadn\u0027t been close to many of the folk of the towns, anyway, preferring to spend his hours with the dwarves or out on the open tundra. As soon as he thought of Ellifain, though, that poor troubled elf who had pursued him to the end of the world, and to the end of her life, Drizzt made the connection. \"You are of the Moonwood,\" he said. The elf glanced at his female companion, bowed, and said \"Tarathiel, at your service.\" It all came flooding back to Drizzt then. Years before, on his journey back to the Underdark, he had traveled through the Moonwood and had met up with the clan of Ellifain. This elf, Tarathiel, had led him away, had even allowed him to ride on of the elf clan\u0027s fine horses for a bit. Their meeting had been brief and to the point, but they had left with mutual respect and a bit of trust. \"Forgive my poor memory,\" Drizzt replied. He wanted to express his gratitude for Tarathiel\u0027s former generosity and to thank the pair for coming to his aid in the recent fight, but he stopped. Drizzt found that he simply did not want to begin that conversation. Did the pair know of Ellifain\u0027s pursuit of him and attack upon him? Could he tell them about Elli-fain\u0027s fate, slain at the end of the very scimitars Drizzt even then held at his sides? \"Well met again, Tarathiel,\" Drizzt said, somewhat curtly. \"And Innovindil,\" Tarathiel remarked, motioning to his beautiful and deadly partner. Drizzt offered her a somewhat stiff bow. \"The orcs are fast returning,\" Innovindil remarked, for she alone had been looking around during the brief exchange. \"Let us go somewhere that we might better speak of the past, and of the present danger that engulfs this region.\" The two started off and motioned for Drizzt to hurry to keep up, but the drow did not. \"We cannot give our enemies a single target of pursuit,\" Drizzt said. \"Perhaps our paths will meet again.\" He gave another bow, slid his scimitars away, and rushed off in the opposite direction. Tarathiel started after Drizzt and started to call out, but Innovindil caught him by the arm. \"Let him go,\" Innovindil whispered. \"He is not ready to speak with us.\" \"I would know about Ellifain,\" Tarathiel protested. \"He knows of us now,\" Innovindil explained. \"He will seek us out when he is ready.\" \"He should be warned of Ellifain at least.\" Innovindil shrugged as if it didn\u0027t matter. \"Is she anywhere about?\" she asked. \"And if so, will her pursuit of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden overrule all sensibility? The land is thick with more immediate enernies.\" Tarathiel continued to look after the departing drow and still leaned that way, but he didn\u0027t pull away from Innovindil\u0027s insistent hold. \"He will seek us out, and soon enough,\" Innovindil promised. \"You sound as if you know him,\" Tarathiel remarked. He turned to regard his companion, to find that she, too, was staring off in the direction of the departing drow. Innovindil slowly nodded. \"Perhaps,\" she replied. Urlgen Threefist watched the latest wave of his shock troops, goblins mostly, charging up the sloping stone ground, throwing themselves with abandon at the dwarven defenses. The orc leader ignored the sudden shift from battle cry to wail of agony, focusing his attention on the defenders of the high ground. The dwarves moved with great precision, but their lines wove a bit more slowly now, the orc leader believed, as if their legs were growing weary. Urlgen\u0027s lip curled back from his tusked mouth in a wicked smile. They should be tired, he knew, for he would allow them no rest. By day, he hit them with his orc forces and by night, his goblin shock troops. Even in those hours of retreat and regroup, the dwarves could not rest, for their defenses were not fully in place. Flashes to the right side of the dwarven line, ahead to Urlgen\u0027s left, drew the tall ore\u0027s attention. Once again the dwarves had anchored their line with a marvelous pair of warriors, a huge human, strong as a giant, and an archer woman whose magical bow had devastated the extreme of Urlgen\u0027s left flank on every attack. They were two of Shallows\u0027s survivors, Urlgen knew, for he remembered well those silvery lines of death - the shining magical arrows - and the barbarian who had inspired terror among his ranks back at the doomed town. The great warrior had held the center of Shallows\u0027s wall single-handedly, scattering the attackers with impunity. His fists struck as hard as iron weapons, and that hammer of his had swept orcs from the wall two or three at a time. Urlgen noted that fewer of the goblins seemed anxious to come in from that angle. His force was more constricted toward the center and right. But still that magical bow fired off shot after shot, and Urlgen had no doubt that the barbarian warrior would find enemies to slaughter. Soon enough, the assault stalled, and the disorganized and overwhelmed goblins came running back down the stony slope. Perhaps as a sign of their growing exhaustion, the dwarves did not pursue nearly as far as on the previous attacks, and Urlgen took faith that he was wearing them down. That notion had the tall orc looking back over his shoulder, back to the wide lands north of his position. Reports had come in of the great gathering of orc tribes. His father\u0027s ranks were swelling. But where were they? Urlgen was torn about the implications of that question. On the one hand, he understood that he simply didn\u0027t have the numbers at his disposal to dislodge the dwarves, and so he wanted those hordes to come forth and help him to push the ugly creatures right off the cliff face and back into their filthy hole at Mithral Hall. But on the other hand, Urlgen wasn\u0027t overly thrilled at the prospect of being rescued by his arrogant father, and even less by the thought of Gerti Orelsdottr coming in with the large remaining force of her giants and devastating the dwarves before him. Perhaps it would be better if things continued as they were, for more warriors were filtering into Urlgen\u0027s force every day. Despite the hundreds of orcs and goblins dead on the mountain slope, Urlgen\u0027s army was actually larger than when he had first cornered the dwarves. He couldn\u0027t risk a straight-out charge to push the dwarves off. But attrition was on his side. She started to draw her bow, but the creature was too close. Always ready to improvise, Catti-brie just flipped the weapon in her hand, bringing it up high before her where she caught it by the end in both hands and swept it out, swatting the pesky goblin across the face. The goblin stumbled backward but was hardly felled by the blow. At last seeing an apparent opening in the defenses of that terrible pair, it and its companions howled and charged the woman. But Catti-brie had dropped her bow and drawn out Khazid\u0027hea, and the sentient, fine-edged blade felt eager in her hands. She met the goblin charge with one of her own, slashing across, then stabbing ahead, once and again. Khazid\u0027hea, nicknamed Cutter, lived up to its reputation, slicing through anything the goblins put in it way: spears, a feeble wooden shield, and more than one arm. The goblin press continued forward, more out of momentum than any eagerness to engage the warrior, but Catti-brie did not back down. A backhand severed a spear tip before the thrusting weapon got close; a turn down had the overbalancing creature throwing its feet out behind it, but a sudden reverse brought Khazid\u0027hea straight up, slicing the goblin\u0027s face in half. Well done! the sword telepathically communicated. \"Glad to be of such service,\" Catti-brie muttered. She forced the sword across, then slid out to the side, sensing a presence coming fast for her back. With perfect timing, Wulfgar rushed past her and headlong into the front of the charging goblin group. Hardly slowing, he ran over the first two in line, kicking them aside as he passed, and swept another couple from out before him with mighty Aegis-fang. It was his turn to pause, and he did so, bringing his hammer around and up high so that Catti-brie could charge past under his upraised arms, Cutter stabbing repeatedly. Within a matter of a few moments, the goblins understood their doom, and those closest to the powerful pair fell all over each other and trampled down those behind them in their frenzy to get away. All the goblins were running then, from one end to the other along the dwarven line. Wulfgar gave pursuit, catching one by the back of the neck in one hand. With a growl, the barbarian put the creature up high, and when it tried to resist, when it tried to swing its club out behind at the man, Wulfgar gave it such a vicious shake that its lips flapped loudly and its body jerked wildly, so much so that its club went flying away. Then the goblin followed, as Wulfgar threw it high and far, and over the lip of the small ravine that marked the end of the dwarven line. The barbarian turned around to see Catti-brie leveling Taulmaril, and he walked back to join the woman as she put a few shots out among the retreating goblins. \"My damned sword\u0027s complaining,\" Catti-brie said to him. \"Wants to be out, fighting and killing enemies.\" She gave a chortle. \"Killing enemies and friends alike, for all Cutter\u0027s caring!\" \"I fear that it will get all that it desires and more,\" Wulfgar replied. \"The wretches don\u0027t even care that we\u0027re slaughtering them,\" said Catti-brie. \"They\u0027re coming up here for no better reason than to keep us tired, and we\u0027re killing them one atop the next.\" \"And in the end, they will have this ridge,\" Wulfgar remarked. He put his arm on Catti-brie\u0027s shoulder as he glanced back, drawing the woman\u0027s gaze with his own. The dwarves were already clearing their wounded, loading them onto stretchers lashed to the rope ladders and sending them down the cliff face using blocks-and-tackle. Only the most grievously wounded of the dwarves were going, of course, since the tough warriors weren\u0027t easily to be taken out of battle, but still, more than a few went over the cliff, sliding down to waiting hands in Keeper\u0027s Dale. Other dwarves who were leaving the battlefield had been lined up off to the side, and there was no hurry to evacuate that group, for they were beyond the help of any priests. \"With the enchanted quiver, I can keep shooting Heartseeker day and night,\" Catti-brie observed. \"I\u0027ll not run short of arrows. Not like Banak\u0027s charges, though, for his line\u0027s to thin and thin. We\u0027ll be getting no help from below, for they\u0027re working hard to secure the lower halls and tunnels, the eastern gate, and Keeper\u0027s Dale.\" \"He would do well to have a quiver like yours,\" Wulfgar agreed, \"only one that produces dwarf warriors instead of magical arrows.\" Catti-brie barely managed a smile at the quip, and in looking at Wulfgar, she knew that he hadn\u0027t meant the statement humorously, anyway. Already the stubborn dwarves were back to their other work, building the defensive positions and walls, but it seemed to Catti-brie that the hammers swung a bit more slowly. The orcs and goblins were wearing them down. The monsters didn\u0027t care for their dead. He came to the lip of the huge boulder silently, on bare feet and with an easy and balanced stride. Drizzt went down to his belly to peer over and spotted the cave opening almost immediately. As he lay there watching, the female elf walked into sight, leading a pega-s. The great steed had one wing tied up tight against its side, but that was no effort to hobble the winged horse, Drizzt knew, but rather some sort of sling. The creature\u0027s discomfort seemed minimal, though. As Drizzt continued to watch, the sun sliding to the horizon behind him, the female elf began to brush the glistening white coat of the pegasus, and she began to sing softly, her voice carrying sweetly to Drizzt\u0027s ears. It all seemed so ... normal. So warm and quiet. The other pegasus came into view then, and Drizzt ducked back a little bit as Tarathiel flew the creature down across the way, beyond his partner. As soon as the steed\u0027s hooves touched stone, Tarathiel dismounted with a graceful movement, putting his left leg over the saddle to the right before him, then turning sidesaddle and simply rolling over into a backward somersault. He landed in easy balance and moved to join his companion - who promptly tossed him a brush so that he could groom his mount. Drizzt watched the pair for a bit longer with a mixture of bitterness and hope. For in them, he saw the promise of Ellifain, saw who she might have become, who she should have become. The unfairness of it all had the drow clenching his hands at his sides, had him gnashing his teeth, had him wanting nothing more than to run off right then and find more enemies to destroy. The sun dipped lower and twilight descended over the land. Side by side, the two elves led their winged horses into the cave. Drizzt rolled onto his back, marking the first twinkling stars of the evening. He rubbed his hands across his face and thought again of Ellifain, and thought again of Bruenor. And he wondered once more what it was all about, what worth all the sacrifice had been, what value was to be found in his adherence to his moral codes. He knew that he should go right off for Mithral Hall, to find out which of his friends, if any, had survived the orc victory at Shallows. But he could not bring himself to do that. Not now. He knew, then, that he should crawl off his rock and go and speak with those elves, with Ellifain\u0027s people, to explain her end and express his sorrow. But the thought of telling Tarathiel such grim news froze him where he lay. He saw again the tower falling, saw again the death of his dearest friend. The saddest day of Drizzt\u0027s life played out so clearly and began to pull him down into the darkness of despair. He rose from the boulder, then, and rushed off into the deepening gloom, running the mile or so to his own tiny cave shelter, and there he sat for a long while, holding the one-horned helmet he had retrieved from the ruins. The sadness deepened as he turned that helmet in his hands. He felt the blackness rising up around him, grabbing at him, and he knew that it would swallow him and destroy him. And so Drizzt used the only weapon he possessed against such despair. He wanted to bring in Guenhwy var, but he could not, for the panther had not rested long enough, given the wounds the giant had inflicted. And so the Hunter went out alone into the dark of night to kill some enemies.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lone-drow-hunter-s-blades-2/page-9.html","bookId":2141,"book":{"id":2141,"title":"The Lone Drow (Hunter\u0027s Blades #2)","description":"Storyline: The Lone Drow (Hunter\u0027s Blades #2) Alone on the battlefield.
