{"id":8757,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"Haw looked down the dark passageway and was aware of his fear. What lay ahead? Was it empty? Or worse, were there dangers lurking? He began to imagine all kinds of frightening things that could happen to him. He was scaring himself to death. Then he laughed at himself. He realized his fears were making things worse. So he did what he would do if he wasn’t afraid. He moved in a new direction. As he started running down the dark corridor he began to smile. Haw didn’t realize it yet, but he was discovering what nourished his soul. He was letting go and trusting what lay ahead for him, even though he did not know exactly what it was. To his surprise, Haw started to enjoy himself more and more. “Why do I feel so good?” he wondered. “I don’t have any Cheese and I don’t know where I am going.” Now he felt the cool breeze that was blowing in this part of the maze and it was refreshing. He took in some deep breaths and felt invigorated by the movement. Once he had gotten past his fear, it turned out to be more enjoyable than he once believed it could be. Haw hadn’t felt this way for a long time. He had almost forgotten how much fun it was. To make things even better, Haw started to paint a picture in his mind. He saw himself in great realistic detail, sitting in the middle of a pile of all his favorite cheeses-from Cheddar to Brie! He saw himself eating the many cheeses he liked, and he enjoyed what he saw. Then he imagined how much he would enjoy all their great tastes. Then he raced through the maze with greater strength and agility. Before long he spotted a Cheese Station and became excited as he noticed little pieces of New Cheese near the entrance. They were types of Cheeses he had never seen before, but they looked great. He tried them and found that they were delicious. He ate most of the New Cheese bits that were available and put a few in his pocket to have later and perhaps share with Hem. He began to regain his strength. He entered the Cheese Station with great excitement. But, to his dismay, he found it was empty. Someone had already been there and had left only the few bits of New Cheese. 唧唧朝着黑暗深遂的通道中望去，又有一阵恐惧袭来。前面有些什么？是不是什么都没有？或者更糟，里面潜藏着危险？他开始想象各种可能降临到他头上的可怕的事情。他越想越怕，快把自己吓死了。 　　忽然，他又觉得自己真是可笑。他意识到，他的畏惧只会使事情变得更糟糕。于是，他采取了当他无所畏惧的时候会采取的行动。他朝一个新的方向跑去。 　　当他跑向这条黑暗的走廊时，他笑了起来。唧唧还没有认识到这一点，但他觉得他的灵魂得到了丰富。他正在放开自己，对前景充满了信心，尽管他并不能确切地知道前面究竟有些什么。 　　出乎意料，他开始对自己感到越来越满意。“为什么我感觉这么好？”他不明白：“我并没有找到奶酪，而且也不知道要到哪里去。” 　　不久，他就明白了他为什么会感觉这么好。 　　他停下脚步，在墙上写道： 　　当你超越了自己的恐惧时， 　　你就会感到轻松自在。 　　他认识到，他原来是被自己的恐惧感给控制住了。如今朝一个新的方向迈进，使他获得了自由。 　　这时，从迷宫中吹来习习的凉风，使人感到神清气爽。他深吸了一口气，不觉振作起来。一旦克服了自己的恐惧感，他觉得一切比原来自己想像的要好得多。 　　唧唧已经很久没有这种感觉了。他几乎就快要忘记了这种感觉是多么的惬意。 　　为了使事情更顺利地进行，他又开始在头脑中描绘一种景象。想像中，他在一种很棒的现实环境，坐在各种他喜欢的奶酪中间——有切达奶酪还有布里奶酪！他看见自己在吃许多他喜欢吃的奶酪。这样的景象使他获得一种享受，他想像着这些奶酪的滋味该是多么美啊！ 　　这种享受新奶酪的情景，他看得越清楚，就越相信这会变成现实。现在，他有一种感觉，他就快要找到奶酪了。 　　他又在墙上写道： 　　在我发现奶酪之前， 　　想像我正在享受奶酪， 　　这会帮我找到新的奶酪。 　　唧唧一直在想的是他将会得到什么，而不是考虑他会失去什么。 　　他不明白，为什么自己过去总是觉得变化会使事情变得更糟。而现在他认识到，变化将会使事情变得更好。 　　“为什么以前我不明白这一点？”他反问自己。 　　于是，他以更大的勇气和力量快速灵敏地穿行在迷宫中。不久他就发现了一个奶酪站。当他在迷宫的入口处发现一些新奶酪的碎屑时，他变得兴奋起来。 　　这是一些他从未见过的奶酪，但看起来挺不错。他尝了尝，真是美味啊！他吃掉了大部分能找到的小块奶酪，把剩下的放进口袋，以后也许可以和哼哼分享。他的体力也开始得到恢复。 　　他怀着兴奋的心情走进去。但是，让他感到惊愕的是，里面竟然是空的。有人已经来过这里，只留下了一些零星的小块奶酪。 　　他认识到，如果能早一点行动，他就很有可能早已在这里发现大量的新奶酪了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/172/3613.html","bookId":286,"book":{"id":286,"title":"谁动了我的奶酪?
