{"id":8751,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"Every morning after that, the mice the little people dressed in their running gear and headed over to Cheese Station C. It wasn’t long before they each established their own routine.\n Sniff and Scurry continued to wake early every day and race through the maze, always following the same route.\n When they arrived at their destination, the mice took off their running shoes, tied them together and hung them around their necks – so they could get to them quickly whenever they needed them again. Then they enjoyed the cheese.\n In the beginning Hem and Haw also raced toward Cheese Station C every morning to enjoy the tasty new morsels that awaited them.\n But after a while, a different routine set in for the little people.\n Hem and Haw awoke each day a little later, dressed a little slower, and walked to Cheese Station C. After all, they knew where the Cheese was now and how to get there.\n They had no idea where the Cheese came from, or who put it there. They hung up their jogging suits, put away their running shoes and put on their slippers. They were becoming very comfortable now that they had found the Cheese.\n “This is great,” Hem said. “There’s enough Cheese here to last us forever.” The little people felt happy and successful, and thought they were now secure.\n It wasn’t long before Hem and Haw regarded the Cheese they found at Cheese Station C as their cheese. It was such a large store of Cheese that they eventually moved their homes to be closer to it, and built a social life around it.\n “We deserve this Cheese,” Hem said. “We certainly had to work long and hard enough to find it.” He picked up a nice fresh piece and ate it.\n 从那以后，这四个家伙，小老鼠和小矮人，每天早上穿上他们的跑步装备后便毫不犹豫地直奔奶酪C站。不久，他们都建立了熟悉的路线，并形成了各自的生活习惯。\n 　　嗅嗅和匆匆仍旧每天都起得很早，然后沿着相同的路线跑进迷宫中。\n 　　当老鼠们到达目的地后，他们脱下自己的跑鞋，有条不紊地将两只鞋系在一起，挂在脖子上——以便需要的时候能够很快穿上。然后，他们才开始尽情地享用奶酪。\n 　　在刚开始的一段时间里，哼哼和唧唧也是如此行事，每天早晨赶到奶酪C站，按部就班的把鞋子挂在脖子上，享用在那里等着他们的美味佳肴。\n 　　然而，不久以后，小矮人们改变了他们的常规。\n 　　哼哼和唧唧每天起得比老鼠们晚一些，懒懒地穿好运动服，然后信步走到奶酪C站。不管怎样，反正已经找到了奶酪。\n 　　他们从没想过，奶酪是从哪里来的，是谁把它们放在那里的。他们只是理所当然地认为，奶酷总是会在那里的。\n 　　每天，哼哼和唧唧到达奶酪C站以后，就像回到了自己家一样，舒适地呆在那里。他们脱下身上的运动衣，把它们挂起来，甩掉脚上的鞋子，换上拖鞋。他们找到了奶酪，感觉实在是太惬意了。\n 　　“真是太好了！”哼哼说：“这里有这么多的奶酪，足够我们享用一辈子了。”小矮人们充满了幸福和成功的感觉，觉得从此可以无忧无虑了。\n 　　不久，哼哼和唧唧更理所当然地认定，他们在奶酪C站发现的奶酪就是“他们自己的”奶酪了。这里的奶酪库存是如此的丰富，于是他们决定把家搬到更靠近奶酪C站的地方，还在周围一带开展了他们的社交活动。\n 　　为了使这里有更象家的感觉，哼哼和唧唧把墙壁装饰了一通，还在墙上写了一些格言，并且精心地画上了一些非常可口的奶酪的图案。他们看着这些图画和格言，会心地笑了。其中一幅图画的内容是：\n 　　拥有奶酪，就拥有幸福。\n 　　有时，他们会带朋友来参观他们在奶酪C站里成堆的奶酪，自豪地指着这些奶酪说：“多么美妙可口的奶酪呀，不是吗？”有时，他们还会与朋友们一起分享这些奶酪，而有时则单独享用。\n 　　“我们应该拥有这些奶酪，”哼哼说，“为了找到它们，我们可是付出了长期而艰苦的努力的，我们当然有资格拥有它们。”他一边说着一边拿起一块鲜美的奶酪放进嘴里，享用起来，脸上流露出幸福的光彩。\n 　　然后，就像往常一样，哼哼享受完奶酪便睡着了，梦中还露出满足而惬意的笑容。\n 　　每天晚上，小矮人们在美美地饱餐了奶酪后，就摇摇摆摆地走回家，第二天早上他们又会信心十足地走进奶酪C站，去享用更多奶酪。\n 　　这样的境况维持了相当长的一段时间。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/172/3607.html","bookId":286,"book":{"id":286,"title":"谁动了我的奶酪?
