{"id":8760,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"As Haw recalled what he had learned, he thought about his friend Hem. He wondered if Hem had read any of the sayings Haw had written on the wall at Cheese Station C and throughout the maze. Had Hem ever decided to let go and move on? Had he ever entered the maze and discovered what could make his life better? Haw thought about going back again to Cheese Station C to see if he could find Hem – assuming that Haw could find his way back there. If he found Hem, he thought he might be able to show him how to get out of his predicament. But Haw realized that he had already tried to get his friend to change. Hem had to find his own way, beyond his comforts and past his fears. No one else could do it for him, or talk him into it. He somehow had to see the advantage of changing himself. Haw knew he had left a trail for Hem and that he could find his way, if he could just read The Handwriting On The Wall. Change Happens They Keep Moving The Cheese Anticipate Change Get Ready For The Cheese To Move Monitor Change Smell the Cheese Often So You Know When It Is Getting Old. Haw realized how far he had come since he had been with Hem in Cheese Station C, but knew it would be easy for him to slip back if he got too comfortable. Each day he inspected Cheese Station N to see what the condition of his Cheese Station N to see what the condition of his Cheese was. He was going to do whatever he could to avoid being surprised by unexpected change. While Haw still had a great supply of Cheese, he often went out into the maze and explored new areas to stay in touch with what was happening around him. He knew it was safer to be aware of his real choices than to isolate himself in his comfort zone. Then, Haw heard what he thought was the sound of movement out in the maze. As the noise grew louder, he realized that someone was coming. Could it be that Hem was arriving? Was he about to turn the corner? Haw said a little prayer and hoped-as he had many times before-that maybe, at last, his friend was finally able to…. Move With The Cheese And Enjoy It! 当他回想起这些自己所学到的东西时，他不由得想起了他的朋友哼哼。他不知道哼哼是否读到了那些他在奶酪C站和迷宫各个角落墙上的留言，不知道哼哼是否已经走出了迷宫。 　　哼哼是否已经决定放开已经失去的过去并开始行动？他是否已经重新回到迷宫中，并且发现了能使他的生活变得更好的东西？ 　　或者，他因为不肯改变，还在那里迟疑不前？ 　　唧唧在考虑回到奶酪C站去，看是否能找到哼哼——但首先得肯定自己能找到回来的路。如果找到了哼哼，他会把自己学到的东西告诉他，帮助他摆脱困境。但唧唧又想起已经试图改变过他的失败经历。 　　哼哼必须自己发现适合自己的道路，摆脱安逸，超越恐惧。没有人可以代替他做到这一点，或者告诉他应该怎样去做。他必须迈出第一步，否则他永远不会看到改变自己所带来的好处。 　　唧唧知道自己已经给哼哼留下了足够的标记，只要他能够迈出第一步，读到墙上的字迹，他就会找到出路。 　　于是唧唧打消了回C站的念头，他站起来走到奶酪N站最大的一面墙前，把他一路上得到的心得体会的要点写了下来。他拿起一块很大的奶酪，这是他见过的奶酪中最大的一块。唧唧品尝着新鲜的奶酪，望着自己写下的体会，脸上绽出了微笑： 　　奶酪墙上的话 　　变化总是在发生 　　他们总是不断地拿走你地奶酪。 　　预见变化 　　随时做好奶酪被拿走的准备 　　追踪变化 　　经常闻一闻你的奶酪， 　　以便知道它们呢什么时候开始变质。 　　尽快适应变化 　　越早放弃旧的奶酪， 　　你就会越早享用到新的奶酪。 　　改变 　　随着奶酪的变化而变化。 　　享受变化！ 　　尝试去冒险，去享受新奶酪的美味！ 　　做好迅速变化的准备 　　不断地去享受变化 　　记住：他们仍会不断地拿走你的奶酪。 　　唧唧在想，自从他在奶酪C站和哼哼分道扬镳以来已经有多久了。他知道自己前进了一大步，但他也很清楚，如果他过分沉溺于N区的安逸生活之中，他就会很快滑落到原来的困境。所以，他每天都仔细检查奶酪N站的情况。他在做一切力所能及的事情，以尽量避免被意料之外的变化打个措手不及。 　　当他还有大量的奶酪贮备时，他就开始经常到外面的迷宫中去，探索新的领地，以便使自己与周围发生的变化随时保持联系。现在的他非常明白，了解各种实际的选择，要比呆在舒适的环境里把自己孤立起来安全得多。 　　“窸窸窣窣”，他听到了什么，唧唧竖起耳朵听了听，他觉得是从迷宫里传来的走动的声音。这声音渐渐大起来，他知道有人正向着这边跑来。 　　会是哼哼到了吗？他会循着那个弯转过来吗？ 　　唧唧念了几句祈祷语，他真的希望——像他以前曾多次希望的那样——也许，他的朋友终于能够…… 　　随着奶酪的变化而变化， 　　并享受变化！ 　　结局…… 　　或者是新的开始？","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/172/3616.html","bookId":286,"book":{"id":286,"title":"谁动了我的奶酪?
