{"id":13126,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV The Vigil on the Cliffs","content":"At ten o\u0027clock, having snatched two hours of sound sleep, Burgoyne was awakened by Phil Branscombe and Withers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s it like outside?\" was Alwyn\u0027s first question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quiet,\" replied Phil. \"What little wind there is is off shore for us, an\u0027 there\u0027s just about enough starlight. I\u0027ve got the pickets and the block, Withers has the rope, and Minalto and Twill are outside.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Although, with one exception, every officer, passenger and man of the Donibristle knew of what was about to take place, and offers of assistance had simply poured in, Burgoyne had been compelled to limit the exploring-party to five. It was the absolute maximum and minimum, since two were required to descend the cliff, and three to man the rope by which the others were to be lowered and hauled up again. \\n\\n \\n\\n The only one not in the secret was the Canuk, Miles. One night recently he had not been in the compound, and, putting two and two together, Captain Blair had concluded that the fellow was in touch with one section of the pirate crew. On that occasion the prisoners had been numbered off both in leaving and returning to the compound, and although one was missing, the fact did not appear to trouble the custodians of the gate. When Captain Blair taxed the delinquent, and demanded an explanation, Miles pitched in a plausible yarn to the effect that he had been working down below on board the Donibristle, and had failed to hear the signal for the working-parties to go ashore. Then, afraid of being found on board by the pirates, he had lain low till the following day. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Old Man accepted the statement without comment, but he fully expected that any day the \"drummer\" would openly join the pirates. \\n\\n \\n\\n To prevent him from \"walking in his sleep\" and stumbling across the men working on the edge of the cliff, Miles was now closely watched by three of the Donibristle\u0027s crew, with instructions from the Old Man that if the fellow attempted to leave his hut before daybreak he was to be forcibly detained. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t do more simply on suspicion,\" the skipper confided to Burgoyne. \"If I were sure that the miserable blighter was playing a dirty trick, over the cliff he\u0027d go one dark night, or my name\u0027s not Roger Blair.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In single file and with the utmost caution the five adventurers made their way to the cliff immediately above the caves that Burgoyne had noticed during the fishing expedition. From the huts where the pirates lived when ashore came the sounds of boisterous revelry. Not a light was visible on the island, but the silhouette of the look-out hill stood out sharply against the starry sky. There were alert men stationed on that lofty perch, but whether they could discern the five figures working silently on the edge of the cliff was extremely doubtful, since the latter did not cut the sky-line. Nor could the pirates on the hill command the expanse of beach below the cliff. \\n\\n \\n\\n Muffling the head of one of the crow-bars with a piece of wet canvas Jasper Minalto drove the iron rod deeply into the ground. The operation was anxiously watched by the rest, fearful lest even the dull thuds of the wood that served as a maul would betray their presence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, so far,\" declared Alwyn. \"Carry on, Minalto.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A second crow-bar was driven home at about a foot from the first and parallel with the edge of the cliff. Between these and about six inches from the ground the third bar was lashed horizontally. Under the fork thus formed a stout beam was thrust, until its end projected three feet into space, with fifteen feet left resting on the turf. The beam had been removed under cover of darkness from one of the tumble-down huts, and must needs be replaced before dawn. \\n\\n \\n\\n To the outward end of the projecting piece of timber the snatch-block had been securely strapped. Then the end of the coil of rope was pressed over the sheave, a \"bowline on the bight\" having been made to accommodate the descending man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All ready, I think,\" said Burgoyne quietly. \"Stand by, and when I\u0027m ready, lower away handsomely.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With four men holding on to the rope the Third Officer slipped into the bowline. The rope ran slowly through the well-oiled block, and Alwyn vanished from sight. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was an eerie sensation dangling at the end of a rope over a cliff more than two hundred feet high. The darkness destroyed the idea of distance, but the descent was none the less hazardous on that account. Although every care had been taken in the surreptitious making of the rope, and every precaution taken to test it, there might be a weak spot that had escaped detection. \\n\\n \\n\\n Almost from the first of the descent the rope began to turn until he was spinning giddily; then, as the length of rope increased, a swaying motion was additionally imparted, until several times Alwyn bumped heavily against the face of the cliff. He was thus able to check the rotary motion at the expense of sundry and various bruises. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By Jove,\" he soliloquized, in the midst of this human punch-ball performance, \"it\u0027ll be rough on Young Bill if we ever have to lower her down. It would scare her stiff right away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The actual descent took four minutes. To Burgoyne it seemed much longer, and it was with considerable relief that he felt his feet touch the soft sand, and was able to extricate his cramped and bruised frame from the embraces of the bowline. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was no need to shout to the others to \"\u0027vast paying out!\" The release of the tension on the rope told them that the descent was accomplished. Then, like a phantom, the bowline vanished as the helpers hauled the rope to the top of the cliff. Within five minutes Jasper Minalto joined Burgoyne on the beach. Since there was the possibility of the rope\u0027s shortening with the release of his weight, and contracting by the heavy dew, he took the precaution of bending in a length of light line and weighting it with a lump of coral. \\n\\n \\n\\n Burgoyne was not likely to fail through lack of precaution or by neglecting to take proper steps to facilitate his return. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cave exceeded the Third Officer\u0027s expectations. It was for the most part dry, the floor being above high-water mark, and the undisturbed sand at its mouth pointed to the fact that a long time had elapsed since human feet had trodden it. Darkness prevented a minute examination, and it was only by a sense of touch that the two men were able to make their investigations. \\n\\n \\n\\n About eighty feet in length, and with a gradually shelving floor, the cave was less than five feet in height at its entrance, but soon increased until Minalto was unable to touch the roof even with his enormous reach. In width it averaged about twelve feet when half a dozen paces inside its mouth. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was water, too. Eagerly Burgoyne groped for and found the steady trickle. Holding his hands cup-fashion he filled his palms with water and held the liquid to his lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fresh!\" he exclaimed to his companion. \"We\u0027re in luck this time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But we\u0027ve nothin\u0027 in the barrel line for tu put et in,\" added Jasper. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not even a petrol tin,\" added Alwyn. \"Ever drunk water out of a petrol tin, Minalto?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Scilly Islander shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Leave ut tu you, sir,\" he replied. \"I\u0027ve a-drunk water wi\u0027 three inches o\u0027 paraffin on top of ut on the West Coast—Accra way. That wur enough for I.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gently jerking the rope, as a signal to Branscombe for the stock of emergency rations to be sent down, Burgoyne gave his companion instructions to bury the stuff in the cave. Leaving Minalto to carry on, the Third Officer walked down to the water\u0027s edge, then, turning abruptly to the left, followed the line of wet sand left by the receding tide. \\n\\n \\n\\n At every possible spot where the cliff might be scalable he approached the base of the rocks, always without the desired result. Carefully obliterating his footprints on the dry sand, he continued his way until farther progress was barred by the abrupt ending of the beach at a point beyond which the cliff rose sheer from the lagoon. \\n\\n \\n\\n The secret base was an unscalable plateau with only one approach—except by means of a rope—and that was the carefully-guarded tunnel, where more than likely (although Burgoyne was not certain on that point) the double portcullis was lowered every night. \\n\\n \\n\\n Disappointed but by no means disheartened Burgoyne returned to the cave, where Jasper had completed his task and was awaiting him. To him Alwyn related the results of his investigations. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lawks!\" exclaimed Minalto. \"You can swim, can\u0027t you, sir? What\u0027s wrong with the reef? Can\u0027t us swim off to \u0027en and walk round to t\u0027 harbour? I\u0027d do it now, on my head like, if you\u0027re in no particular hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sharks?\" queried Alwyn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sharks!\" repeated Jasper. \"Ain\u0027t seen none since I\u0027ve bin on the island, an\u0027 many\u0027s the time I\u0027ve watched the water an\u0027 within\u0027 I could have a swim. What d\u0027ye say, sir. Might I go?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Burgoyne was fired by the man\u0027s enthusiasm. It was now midnight. Allowing three hours to cover a distance of six or seven miles, Minalto ought with luck to be back well before four. This would give the party an hour and a half before dawn in which to \"pack up\", replace gear, remove all traces of the night\u0027s work, and regain their quarters. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right,\" agreed the Third Officer. \"I\u0027ll come with you as far as the end of the bay. Wish I could do the whole thing, only the others would be scared stiff and think we\u0027d done ourselves in. When I return I\u0027ll get myself hauled up and wait on the top of the cliff. You know the signal? Right, and don\u0027t forget to wipe out your footprints. The tide will be at quarter flood on your return.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With many other cautions and suggestions, Burgoyne accompanied the stout-hearted seaman to a spot where the reef approached to within three hundred yards of the shore. \\n\\n \\n\\n Taking off his shoes, and slinging them round his neck, Minalto waded waist-deep into the water and struck out for the line of milk-white foam that marked the reef. Burgoyne remained at the edge of the lagoon until the phosphorescent swirl that marked the swimmer\u0027s progress was merged into the darkness. He had no indication that Minalto had reached the reef, for his white-clad form would be indistinguishable against the ever-breaking wall of foam. \\n\\n \\n\\n Retracing his way to the cave Burgoyne slipped into the bowline and tugged three times at the rope. The signal was promptly answered, and the swaying, roundabout ascent commenced. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" inquired Branscombe anxiously, when Alwyn landed safely on the top of the cliff. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All serene,\" replied the Third Officer, a little breathlessly. \"We\u0027ll have to stand by for a few hours. Minalto has gone on a voyage of exploration. That chap gave me a thundering good idea. I was getting a bit tied up in knots when I found there was no way up from the beach, so he suggested walking along the reef—and he\u0027s gone and done it,\" he added vernacularly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dispatching Twill to inform Captain Blair of the alteration of plans, so that the Old Man would not be unduly anxious about their failure to return at the suggested time, the three officers prepared to make the best of their long vigil. They took fifteen minutes\u0027 shifts to tend the rope, so that should Minalto return before they expected there would be no delay in receiving his signal and hauling him up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can you get hold of another length of signal halyard, Phil?\" asked Alwyn. \"Another three hundred feet of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I dare say,\" replied Branscombe. \"I\u0027ll have a jolly good shot at getting it, anyway. What\u0027s the scheme?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Burgoyne rubbed his aching shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you\u0027d been barged into the cliff umpteen times, old son, you\u0027d know,\" he declared grimly. \"We want a guide-line, stretched taut and about eighteen inches inside the rope. That\u0027ll prevent anyone being bumped, and also spare them the luxury of an impromptu merry-go-round. We\u0027ll have to lower Young Bill, and we may as well make things as comfortable as possible for her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quite so,\" agreed Phil. \"I\u0027ll get some line tomorrow, even if it makes my figure look like that of a portly alderman. It wouldn\u0027t be a bad idea either to get hold of some spare canvas. You\u0027ll want some sort of awning or tent for the boat, and it will come in handy. For one thing, we can wrap Miss Vivian up in it when we lower her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What for?\" asked Withers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To protect her in case any loose stones fall from the cliff,\" explained Branscombe. \"\u0027Sides, if she\u0027s covered up she won\u0027t be quite so frightened when she\u0027s being lowered. At least, I shouldn\u0027t think so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For some minutes silence reigned, save for the ever-present dull rumble of the surf. Then Withers apparently without any reason, began chuckling to himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is it?\" asked Phil. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the joke,\" added Alwyn. \"Out with it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing much,\" replied Withers. \"Only a reminiscence. This cliff recalled it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He paused, his eyes fixed seaward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s have it, old son,\" prompted Branscombe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought I saw a vessel\u0027s masthead light out there,\" declared the Second Engineer. \"Must have been mistaken.... The yarn? Oh, it was merely an incident. It was in \u002714, just after war broke out. I was on a collier awaiting orders at Whitby. Everyone was on thorns over the spy scare. Well, one night, there was a report that lights were flashing on the cliff, and a crowd of fellows went off to investigate. Having nothing better to do that evening, I went too. Sure enough there were lights about every half minute. About two miles from Whitby we ran full tilt into a couple of men striking matches, so they were promptly collared.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The narrator paused and looked seaward again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What happened?\" asked Burgoyne. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing—they were released,\" replied Withers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t see anything funny in that,\" remarked Phil. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it was funny—and pathetic, too,\" explained Withers. \"They were deaf mutes. One lived in a small cottage near Kettleness, and the other\u0027s home was in York. They had missed the last train for Kettleness and were walking along the cliff path to Whitby. Their only means of communicating with each other was by lip-reading, and since it was dark they stopped and struck matches whenever they wanted to converse. They had used up three boxes of matches by the time we came up. Poor blighters! As likely as not they didn\u0027t know there was a war on; if they did it was obvious they hadn\u0027t heard about the regulations concerning coastwise lights. But, by Jove! surely those are vessel\u0027s steaming lights?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is, by smoke!\" exclaimed Burgoyne. \"A steamer going south. I can just distinguish her port light.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Malfilio perhaps?\" suggested Branscombe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not she,\" declared Withers. \"That steam pipe of hers will take at least two days more before it\u0027s patched up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can see her green, now,\" announced Alwyn \"She\u0027s altering course. If she holds on she\u0027ll pile herself upon the reef.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Helpless to warn the on-coming vessel—for even had the three officers been provided with means of signalling they would have incurred heavy penalties by the pirates and the wrecking of all the formers\u0027 carefully laid plans—the watchers on the cliff awaited events. \\n\\n \\n\\n The vessel was now steaming dead slow—at least she took an unconscionable time in approaching. That was in her favour. It might give the look-outs the opportunity to hear the roar of the surf; while, even if she did strike, and were held by the coral reef, she would not be likely to sustain serious damage. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly a dazzling glare leapt from the vessel and the giant beam of a searchlight swept the island. From where the three officers lay prone on the grass they could see the rim of the cliff outlined in silver. The crest of the Observation Hill was bathed in the electric gleams, but elsewhere, owing to the depression towards the centre of the plateau, the island was in darkness. So carefully chosen was the site of the various buildings that nowhere from seaward could they be visible. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A warship!\" declared Burgoyne. \"I say, this complicates matters. Let\u0027s get back to the huts, or we\u0027ll be missed. We can return before dawn.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Cautiously the three officers made their way down the slight slope, where the darkness, by contrast with the slowly traversing beam of light overhead, was intense. \\n\\n \\n\\n When within fifty yards of the nearest of the prisoners\u0027 huts Burgoyne gripped his companions\u0027 arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lie down!\" he whispered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Both officers obeyed promptly. Alwyn, on hands and knees, went on. Presently he rejoined them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s too late,\" he said in a low voice. \"There is an armed pirate outside every hut.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1610/47710.html","bookId":1247,"book":{"id":1247,"title":"The Third Officer","description":"简介： To the accompaniment of a pungent whiff of hot oil, a miniature cascade of coal dust and frozen snow, and the rasping sound of the derrick chain, the last of the cargo for No. 3 hold of the S.S.
