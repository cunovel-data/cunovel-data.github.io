{"id":13136,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV The Cave proves Useful","content":"During the two days following all hands were kept busily employed. In addition to carrying out the usual routine, they made preparations to lay in a stock of provisions. Mostyn tried his hand at obtaining salt by evaporation, and succeeded in making about a pound of very saline powder. Minalto cut up the porker, reserving some of the meat for present use and pickling the rest. Hilda experimented with making biscuits of taro root finely powdered and bruised between two large stones. In addition the three men took turns at climbing to the summit of the look-out hill. This they did every four hours in calm weather, and every two hours when the wind blew with any strength, so that no sailing vessel could close with the island between those intervals without first being sighted in the offing. On the morning of the fourth day Jasper called Burgoyne\u0027s attention to a rectangular object lying on the top of a low-lying part of the reef. The tide had fallen exceptionally, and more of the reef was exposed than they had seen before. \"I believe it\u0027s our water-tank,\" declared Alwyn. \"That\u0027s about where the boat broke her back.\" \"So I thinks, too, sir,\" agreed Minalto. \"In that case we\u0027ll have the thing ashore,\" declared Burgoyne. \"It would never do to leave such a monument to our mishaps lying in such a conspicuous position.\" \"How would you bring it across?\" asked Mostyn. \"It looks as if it is lying on its side,\" replied the Third Officer, shading his eyes with his hand. \"We\u0027ll have to up-right it and let the rising tide float it off. A couple of us could easily swim over there and push it across the lagoon. No, not yet. We\u0027ll have to wait for the young flood to make. Meanwhile it\u0027s your turn, Jasper, to climb the hill. Nothing like exercise before breakfast.\" Minalto swung off, and hurried to perform his task of look-out man. In less than a quarter of an hour he was back again, breathless with running. \"A sail!\" he announced pantingly. \"Away to nor\u0027ard.\" \"Dash it all!\" exclaimed Burgoyne. The information disconcerted him. For the sake of his companions both on Swan Island and in the hands of the pirates at the secret base, he would have welcomed the intelligence if he knew for certain that the strange craft was a friendly one. But an instinctive feeling told him that the craft was manned by some of Ramon Porfirio\u0027s ruffianly crowd, and that the object of her voyage was to recapture the four fugitives. Without undue delay all hands hurried to the summit of the hill, Alwyn pausing only to scatter the burning logs over which the morning meal was boiling, Hilda suffering the interruption of her culinary task without protest. From the elevated look-out post the vessel could be seen fairly clearly. The morning was bright, with no sign of haze, and the craft appeared nearer than she actually was. In spite of the light breeze she was approaching rapidly, so that it was evident that she was equipped with a motor. She was then about a mile and a half or two miles off the northern part of the island, shaping a course for the eastern side. She was a fore-and-aft schooner, carrying jib-headed top-sails, and was of about eighty tons displacement. She flew no colours. \"What would I not give for my prism binoculars?\" sighed Alwyn. \"Seen her before, Minalto?\" Jasper nodded. He was still rather breathless. \"Yes,\" continued Burgoyne, \"unless I\u0027m much mistaken she was one of those small craft lying in the pirates\u0027 harbour; but I\u0027m hanged if I noticed whether any of them had motors. Well, we\u0027ll have to get a move on, Miss Vivian. I\u0027m sorry to say that your wish of a few days ago will have to be complied with. We must hide in the cave, perhaps for several days. I don\u0027t suppose those rascals will abandon the search until they\u0027ve examined every visible part of the island.\" \"How about the water-tank?\" asked Mostyn. \"Too late, now, I\u0027m afraid,\" replied his chum. \"It will be as much as we can do to transfer ourselves and our traps to the cave.... This way down; in case they\u0027ve a glass bearing on us.\" Keeping to the south slope of the hill until the tree-tops shut out the sight of the approaching vessel, the fugitives returned to the camp. There was much to be done in a very short time. The tent was levelled and packed up in the smallest possible compass. The canvas between the two upturned parts of the broken life-boat was removed. The hot embers of the dying fire was carefully scattered, lest they might kindle into flame and smoke. Then, heavily laden with stores and provisions, the four hastened towards the cave. \"One minute, sir!\" exclaimed Jasper, stopping short in his tracks and setting down his burden. \"If us ain\u0027t forgotten the li\u0027l ole cask o\u0027 rum.\" Burgoyne glanced behind towards the lagoon, a small portion of which was visible through the glade. \"Too late, now,\" he replied. \"The schooner\u0027s passing through the reef. Yes, she has an engine right enough. The water-tank must have given us away. Come along, Jasper; you\u0027ve seen the last of your li\u0027l ole cask, I\u0027m thinking.\" There was a stubborn look on Minalto\u0027s bronzed and bearded face as he reluctantly re-shouldered his burden. It went sorely against the grain, this tame surrender of what he considered to be his property by finding. \"Come along!\" repeated Burgoyne sternly. \"Ay, ay, sir,\" replied Minalto; then under his breath he added: \"an\u0027 I hope th\u0027 li\u0027l ole cask\u0027ll poison the lot o\u0027 they.\" It was now a slow and cautious business getting the stores and gear into the cave, and in spite of every care Burgoyne noticed with concern that the tracks under the scrub were by no means covered. A keen Malay tracker would be able to find their retreat with little difficulty. The only hope lay in the fact that the crew of the schooner were unskilled in woodcraft, and that the broken twigs and brushwood would escape notice. \"Here\u0027s our present abode, Miss Vivian,\" announced Burgoyne, when the four and their portable property were inside the cave, a couple of candles lighted, and a double sheet of canvas hung across the entrance to screen any gleam from within. \"It reminds me of London during an air-raid,\" observed Hilda. \"I had to spend several nights in a cellar—I was made to go down, but I would have much preferred to stop in an upper room. But there is nothing to be afraid of here as far as bombs are concerned.\" \"No; silence is the chief consideration,\" cautioned Alwyn. \"I don\u0027t suppose they\u0027ve sent a boat ashore yet, but I think I\u0027ll find out.\" \"Don\u0027t run unnecessary risks, please, Mr. Burgoyne,\" said Hilda. \"Trust me for that, Miss Vivian,\" declared the Third Officer earnestly. \"Risks, yes; unnecessary risks, no. I\u0027ve no use for the fellow who goes out asking for trouble.\" \"I\u0027m going with you, old son,\" said Peter. \"My festive Sparks, you are not,\" decided Burgoyne. \"For the present this is a one-man show. You stop here, and don\u0027t stir outside till I come back. All being well, I\u0027ll return in twenty minutes, if not before.\" Withdrawing the cartridges from his revolver, Alwyn carefully tried the mechanism of the little weapon. Then, after reloading, he thrust the revolver into his hip-pocket, and, with a wave of his hand, disappeared behind the canvas hanging. It was a tedious wait for the three who remained. Without means of knowing the time, the minutes passed very, very slowly. Peter tried to gauge the interval by observing the burning down of one of the candles. The others waited and listened intently for any sounds that might reach their ears from without the cave. Even the practical Hilda Vivian looked anxious and worried. Mostyn, not usually observant of people\u0027s characters, noticed that, and wondered whether the girl was anxious on Burgoyne\u0027s account or merely because of the peril that threatened her. At length Minalto stood up, stretched his huge arms and picked up the cutlass, which Mostyn had brought to a state bordering on perfection, for the blade had been cleaned and sharpened, and the hilt shone like a convex mirror in the candle-light. \"I\u0027m going to look for \u0027e,\" he declared in a hoarse whisper. \"You\u0027re going to stay here,\" said Mostyn firmly. \"Officer\u0027s orders, you know.\" Minalto was about to frame an argumentative reply, when a chorus of raucous voices sounded in the distance. Without further delay Jasper pulled aside the canvas screen, only to collide violently with Alwyn Burgoyne. \"Ssh!\" exclaimed the latter warningly. \"Get back. They\u0027re ashore.\" \"The pirates?\" asked Mostyn. \"Yes, unfortunately,\" replied Burgoyne. \"They brought up off the little creek and hoisted Yankee colours. Thought they\u0027d have us cold, but it didn\u0027t come off. I waited under a bush—rather longer than I intended, perhaps; but, you see, I wanted to make sure of their little game. After a bit they got tired of seeing the Stars and Stripes at the main truck, so they hauled the bunting down. Up to that point I\u0027d seen only three men aboard; but by this time they\u0027d come to the conclusion that we weren\u0027t having any. So they launched a boat and rowed ashore: eight men armed with rifles, and our old friend Strogoff sporting a pair of automatics. I thought it high time to sheer off, so I crept back for about fifty yards and again watched developments.\" \"Eight of \u0027em, not a-countin\u0027 Black Strogoff, were you sayin\u0027, sir?\" inquired Minalto thoughtfully. \"Sure, \u0027tes long odds, wi\u0027 only a pistol an\u0027 a cutlass \u0027twixt three on us. Was there more on \u0027em left aboard, sir?\" \"I cannot say, Jasper. More than likely there were, but I didn\u0027t see them. They\u0027d hardly all go ashore.\" \"Ef us could slip along, like,\" resumed Jasper, \"an\u0027 swim off to the schooner—— When all\u0027s nice an\u0027 dark like.\" \"They\u0027ll probably go on board again to-night,\" said Burgoyne. \"We\u0027ll have to think things out a bit. But when I left them they were smashing up our happy home just out of sheer mischief. When they\u0027ve got tired of that they\u0027ll begin searching the island, so we had better lie low and keep quiet.\" Presently the four fugitives heard the sounds of men forcing their way through the undergrowth, uttering fierce oaths in half a dozen different languages and occasionally firing their rifles. During intervals between the din, Black Strogoff\u0027s voice could be heard shouting an ultimatum to the objects of his search, to the effect that if they gave themselves up without further trouble, \"including the young woman\" (\"so they know,\" thought Alwyn), their lives would be spared. Otherwise he, Strogoff, would search the island from end to end and shoot the men down without mercy. The pirates were evidently following a trail, which turned out to be the well-trodden path leading to the summit of the look-out hill. So keen were they on the obvious track that they failed entirely to notice the tell-tale broken brushwood concealing the mouth of the cave. After the sounds of the pursuit had died away in the distance, Jasper proposed that he should go out and see what was happening in the lagoon. \"No, you don\u0027t,\" said Burgoyne decidedly. \"Ten to one you\u0027ll play straight into their hands, if you did. I shouldn\u0027t be at all surprised to know that they had posted snipers at various intervals to pick us off if we ventured out. Patience and discretion, Jasper. That\u0027s our motto for the present. How about grub?\" Another candle was lighted. They were of a kind known in the Royal Navy as \"candles, lantern, ship\u0027s police \", and in their present condition might be reckoned upon to burn four or five hours; so with the stock at their command the fugitives were not likely to be compelled to sit in the darkness. Slowly the long day passed. At intervals the voices of the pirates could be heard, as they returned to the boat apparently to hold a council as to the next course to pursue. Black Strogoff had abandoned his delivery of an ultimatum. He was still sanguine of success, since the discovery of the wreckage of the life-boat and the hot ashes of the camp-fire proved almost conclusively that his quarry was on the island and unable to leave it. At last night fell upon the scene. Although it made no visible difference to the interior of the cave, the darkness was noticed by the four fugitives mainly by the change of temperature, and the fact was confirmed when Burgoyne cautiously drew the screen and looked out. \"We\u0027ll have to be jolly careful with that light now,\" he observed. \"A glimmer escaping and shining on the brushwood would give the show away in a brace of shakes. Put the candle in the old chest, Jasper; that will screen it a bit.\" After a cold supper Hilda and Mostyn dropped off into fitful slumbers. Alwyn and Jasper remained on watch, straining their ears to catch any sound that might indicate the presence and occupation of their pursuers. Soon there were no doubts on the matter. The rogues had not gone on board the schooner but were carousing on shore. Some of them in wanton mischief and with the lust of destruction had fired the brush-wood. The roaring of the flames outvoiced that of the pirates, but fortunately the nor\u0027east wind kept the fire from spreading towards the mouth of the cave. \"They\u0027re going it strong,\" remarked Burgoyne. \"It must be long after midnight. They\u0027ve started to quarrel now, I think.\" \"An\u0027 the li\u0027l ole cask,\" said Minalto broodingly. \"Ef I\u0027d but taken ut away....\" The distant pandemonium waxed and waned according to the temper and excitability of the roysterers. The ribald singing was succeeded by a volley of oaths and rifle-shots and blood-curdling shrieks. Minalto jogged his companion\u0027s elbow. \"That\u0027s fine!\" he exclaimed with marked approval. For the next hour the loud roar of the flames, as the fire overwhelmed the coco-palms, completely muffled all other sounds, but when at length, towards morning, the conflagration burnt itself out, there was a strange uncanny silence. \"Have a caulk, sir,\" said Jasper. \"I\u0027ll be wide awake, if you\u0027m of a mind to sleep.\" \"I think I will, then,\" replied Burgoyne gratefully, and for the next two hours he slept like a log. The slanting rays of the sun were penetrating the brushwood when Alwyn awoke and lifted the canvas covering the entrance to the cave. The air was thick with pungent smoke. \"Wake up, Peter!\" exclaimed Burgoyne. \"Stand by till we return. We\u0027re going out to see what\u0027s doing.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1610/47720.html","bookId":1247,"book":{"id":1247,"title":"The Third Officer","description":"简介： To the accompaniment of a pungent whiff of hot oil, a miniature cascade of coal dust and frozen snow, and the rasping sound of the derrick chain, the last of the cargo for No. 3 hold of the S.S.
