{"id":13132,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX The Voyage","content":"Within two minutes Burgoyne was sleeping the sleep of sheer exhaustion, nor did he awake until the slanting rays of the early morning sun shone in his face, as the boat heeled to the now beam wind. \n \n \"You\u0027re a bright one, Mostyn,\" he exclaimed, as he stretched his cramped limbs. \"Do you call this two hours?\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t like turning you out,\" replied the Wireless Officer. \"After all, I\u0027ve had quite a soft time. Only had to trim the sheet once, and she carries just the right amount of weather helm.\" \n \n Balancing himself on the after thwart Alwyn scanned the horizon. All around sky and sea met in an unbroken line. Neither land nor vessel of any description was in sight. Satisfied on that score the Third Officer took stock of the boat. Underneath the tent Hilda Vivian was sleeping soundly. Her regular breathing was sufficient evidence to prove that. \n \n Curled up athwartships, with his head pillowed on one of the canvas water-tanks—for which there had been no need in their original r?le—was Jasper Minalto, snoring like a young bull. He, too, had scarcely stirred for the last four hours. \n \n \"Let him stop,\" said Burgoyne. \"I\u0027ll take on now. You might get out some grub before you turn in, and there are some tin mugs in the after locker.\" \n \n \"I brought along some lime-juice,\" announced Mostyn. \"Holmes told me I could have it, and it may come in jolly useful. Branscombe lowered a dozen coco-nuts over the cliff and stowed those on board, too; so we shall be able to have some sort of variety. What\u0027s the menu? Bully and biscuits?\" \n \n The two men ate their first meal on board with evident relish; then Mostyn turned in, leaving Burgoyne at the helm. \n \n It was a glorious day. As the sun gathered strength its warm rays brought comfort to the helmsman. For the first time for nearly twenty hours his comparatively thin clothing was dry, and his cramped limbs regained their usual suppleness. \n \n \"Things might be a jolly sight worse,\" he soliloquized. \"We\u0027re clear of the island and no sign of any craft in pursuit. The breeze is fair and steady, we\u0027ve a reasonable amount of grub in the locker, and a staunch little craft for the trip. I wonder what the others are doing, and whether Strogoff and his bravos are cutting up rough?\" \n \n In about half an hour after Burgoyne had resumed the \"stick\" Minalto stirred himself, and sat up with a look of wonderment on his face, sniffing the morning air with deep appreciation. \n \n \"Eh, sir!\" he exclaimed. \"I\u0027ve just had a wonderful dream. We wur havin\u0027 fried bacon, an\u0027 taters an\u0027 all. I could smell \u0027en, real as anythin\u0027-like, an\u0027 it doesn\u0027t haf smell good.\" \n \n \"\u0027Fraid that\u0027s as far as you\u0027ll get just now,\" replied Alwyn with a laugh. \"Come on! Biscuits and bully is our mark.\" \n \n He glanced at the well-filled foresail and then to windward. \n \n \"May as well get the rest of the canvas set,\" he remarked. \"The breeze is moderating a bit.\" \n \n Lashing the helm the Third Officer assisted Minalto in the task of hoisting the standing lug. Before this was accomplished Hilda, disturbed by the noise, awoke and crawled from under the awning. \n \n \"Good morning!\" she exclaimed. \n \n \"Mornin\u0027 to you, young Teddy,\" replied Jasper, touching his trailing forelock, while Alwyn removed his cap from his shock of tousled hair. \n \n \"Young Bill\u0027s shaved this morning,\" she continued with a disarming smile. \"I\u0027m sorry to have to say that Mr. Burgoyne has not.\" \n \n \"I thought I once heard you remark,\" rejoined Alwyn, \"that you were rather partial to beards!\" \n \n \"Yes, torpedo beards, tawny for preference,\" admitted the girl. \n \n The Third Officer complacently stroked the stubbly growth of hair that completely hid his cheeks and chin. \n \n \"For the matter of that,\" he observed, \"a pair of scissors will do the trick when we get back to civilization.\" \n \n \"But your beard is red, not tawny,\" countered Hilda laughingly. \"But don\u0027t worry about that, Mr. Burgoyne. I think I prefer you as you were on board the Donibristle—clean-shaven. That is from an appearance point of view. Just now you look a bit of a ruffian, but you\u0027re splendid. I shall never be able to thank you sufficiently for all the danger you have gone through—and the others as well, of course—to get me away from the island.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s jolly good of you to say that, Miss Vivian,\" said Alwyn. \"We\u0027ve got you clear of the island, it\u0027s true, but we are by no means out of the wood yet. Now: ready for something to eat?\" \n \n Telling Minalto to take the tiller Alwyn prepared the girl\u0027s breakfast. In the absence of a knife or a tin-opener the bully-beef tin had to be battered open with a rowlock, since, as is almost invariably the case, the patent opener provided failed utterly in its predestined mission. The biscuits, too, had long lost their crispness, and the water, notwithstanding the addition of a small quantity of lime-juice, was decidedly \"cloudy\" owing to the continuous motion of the boat. In default of a plate the beef had to be spread out on a piece of canvas which Burgoyne had washed by trailing over the side; while a total deficiency of cutlery resulted in the application of nature\u0027s knives and forks. \n \n Yet Hilda enjoyed the rough-and-ready repast. She was naturally a high-spirited girl, passionately fond of an open-air life, and the novelty of the situation appealed to her. Burgoyne thought she looked the picture of health, with her finely-modelled features, of rich bronze hue by reason of exposure to the sun and rain, her closely-bobbed hair, and her mirth-loving eyes. Even her present costume suited her, the canvas jumper and the battered straw hat setting off to perfection her slim figure and the naturally graceful poise of her head. \n \n For the four or five hours all went well with the Argonauts, but about midday the breeze died utterly away and the boat drifted idly with her sails drooping listlessly from the yards. The heat was terrific. Almost overhead the sun blazed down mercilessly, while the reflected rays from the mirror-like ocean seemed almost as hot as the sunshine itself. \n \n With the paint blistering and the woodwork too hot to touch comfortably the boat was like a small furnace. Even the water left in the lands and bilges quickly disappeared, throwing out a noxious-smelling vapour. \n \n Leaving one man to keep watch, the rest of the crew sat under hastily-devised awnings over which salt water was frequently poured in the hope that the rapid evaporation would lower the temperature under the canvas. Sleep was an impossibility; speech became a matter of difficulty, for even frequent small draughts of water failed to keep their throats from being parched and dry. Sweltering in the enervating heat they existed listlessly, their jangled nerves still further jarred by the monotonous slatting of the canvas and the steady thud of the yards against the gently-swaying masts. \n \n Suddenly Mostyn, whose turn it was to keep a lookout, startled the others by shouting: \n \n \"Land ahead!\" \n \n Shaking off his lethargy Burgoyne emerged from under the awning. For some reason he could see nothing but a red mist that swam in front of his eyes. \n \n \"Where away?\" he inquired. \n \n \"Right ahead,\" repeated the Wireless Officer, rather astonished that Alwyn could not see what was only too clear to him: a dark line almost on the horizon. \n \n \"Land!\" exclaimed Burgoyne, his normal vision returning. \"That\u0027s not land, old son. It\u0027s a breeze ruffling the water, and pretty strong, too. We\u0027ll have it in a few minutes—and dead in our teeth, worse luck.\" \n \n Aided by Minalto, Burgoyne quickly stowed the awning, then casting loose both sheets he awaited rather anxiously the approach of the breeze. \n \n \"Looks more like a squall,\" he said, half to himself. Then raising his voice he continued: \"Stow the mizzen. Mostyn, you stand by the fore halliard, and douse the sail in a brace of shakes if I give the word.\" \n \n Soon there was no doubt about the nature of the approaching wind. It was a white squall—one of those dangerous puffs, often attaining a strength of from forty to sixty miles an hour, that swoop down with devastating effect upon the vessel whose careless look-out has allowed it to take him unawares. \n \n \"Down foresail!\" shouted Burgoyne. \"We\u0027ll have to ride to a sea-anchor.\" \n \n Abandoning the useless tiller, which Mostyn had already yielded to him, Alwyn sprang forward to assist the rest of the crew in preparing a floating breakwater to which the boat could with safety ride to the wind and waves. Quickly the kedge was attached to the clew of the sail, a span bent to the yard and at its centre the whole scope of the boat\u0027s painter with an additional length of rope. \n \n In desperate haste the whole contraption was hove overboard. The yard and sail, weighed down by the kedge, sank like a stone. \n \n The next instant, with a weird, almost blood-curdling shriek, the squall burst. In an instant the hitherto placid surface of the ocean was lashed into an expanse of white foam. \n \n Caught fairly on the broadside the life-boat was knee deep in water before she took up the strain of the sea-anchor. Then riding to a tautened cable she swung round bows on to the now threatening breakers. \n \n The three men baled desperately. Hilda, too, realizing the importance of freeing the boat from water, plied an empty bully-beef tin vigorously. Her straw hat had been whisked off, although Mostyn had caught it as it swept to leeward; her short locks were streaming in the wind, spray lashed her face like the sting of a whip, yet in the wild display of Nature\u0027s elements her faith in the prowess and skill of the three men was undiminished. Without a trace of fear she was toiling, not because she thought she was in danger, but because she knew she could be of assistance to her companions. \n \n In ten minutes the worst was over. The wind dropped considerably, and though the waves were not running exactly mountains high, they had quite a menacing appearance. Yet the sea-anchor, which was now only a few feet below the surface, and fifty yards ahead of the boat, broke the angry seas in a way that imparted confidence to all hands. \n \n It was an hour later before Burgoyne thought it prudent to rehoist sail. The mizzen, close-reefed, was first hoisted and sheeted home. Then the foresail got inboard, single-reefed and set. The boat\u0027s head fell away, then gathering way she darted buoyantly over the long, crested waves. \n \n Contrary to Alwyn\u0027s expectations the wind had neither veered nor backed. It blew strongly from the same quarter, which meant that for every mile made good the boat had to sail thrice that distance. \n \n For the rest of the day they sailed close-hauled, tacking at the end of every hour. All three men knew how to get the best out of the boat, keeping her sufficiently full to allow the canvas to draw well. \n \n Sunset came with every indication of bad weather. The sun sank behind a bank of copper-coloured clouds, while the sky resembled what Minalto described as a \"basin o\u0027 pea-soup\". \n \n \"We\u0027re in for it, I think,\" remarked Burgoyne to Mostyn. \"I think we\u0027d better close reef the foresail while it\u0027s light. Then you take first watch—two hours only this time, mind; I\u0027ll take the next, and Minalto carries on after me. That will give you four hours\u0027 sleep.\" \n \n \"Right-o,\" agreed Mostyn, preparing to go for\u0027ard with Minalto to reduce canvas still further. \"Go about at the end of each watch, I suppose?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" agreed Alwyn, \"unless, of course, it\u0027s blowing too hard for one hand to dip the sail. In that case it\u0027ll be all hands \u0027bout ship.\" \n \n At about nine o\u0027clock Burgoyne awoke and relieved the Wireless Officer at the helm. During a lull in the wind the manoeuvre of putting the boat on the port tack was a fairly simple one. \n \n Left to himself the Third Officer steered by the wind, occasionally checking his course by means of his pocket compass. It was now pitch dark, not a star was visible. Very soon it began to rain—big drops that borne by the stiff breeze rattled with considerable force against the helmsman\u0027s face. Spray he could and did endure with equanimity; in fact he rather revelled in the salt-laden showers, but Burgoyne had the deep-sea man\u0027s rooted objection to rain. \n \n Pulling the peak of his disreputable cap well down over the left side of his face and drawing a piece of painted canvas over his shoulders, Alwyn settled down to make the best of things. \n \n His trick was almost done when it suddenly occurred to him that the seas were no longer regular; in fact the boat was entering a patch of confused water. \n \n Thinking it was a sudden shift of wind that accounted for the nasty cross seas Burgoyne glanced at his compass. The wind had backed; a point, perhaps, not more; and that was not sufficient to justify the agitation of the water. \n \n He glanced to leeward. Above the howling of the wind his ear caught the unmistakable sound of surf. Not only abeam but ahead a line of milky foam warned him of the peril that threatened. The boat, close-reefed, was driving to leeward, and was already within two hundred yards of one of those dangerous coral reefs with which certain parts of the Pacific Ocean are studded. \n \n \"All hands!\" he shouted. \"Stand by and \u0027bout ship.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1610/47716.html","bookId":1247,"book":{"id":1247,"title":"The Third Officer","description":"简介： To the accompaniment of a pungent whiff of hot oil, a miniature cascade of coal dust and frozen snow, and the rasping sound of the derrick chain, the last of the cargo for No. 3 hold of the S.S.
