{"id":13118,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI Under Hatches","content":"\"That\u0027s done it,\" ejaculated Burgoyne under his breath. \"Why that ass Branscombe hadn\u0027t put Miss Vivian with the deck-hands passes my comprehension. She\u0027ll be separated from her father straight away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was furious but impotent. He pictured Hilda ordered below into the hot, steam-laden, dusty stokehold, imprisoned in an iron box, in which only hardened firemen could endure the discomforts, especially in latitudes approaching the tropics. He wondered whether Colonel Vivian would break the bonds of restraint and jeopardize the lives of all the passengers, or whether Hilda would give way under the parting, which might or might not be permanent. \\n\\n \\n\\n The fact that Alwyn was now senior executive officer complicated matters. He was responsible for the safety of passengers and crew as far as lay in his power, and he was under the impression that Branscombe\u0027s ill-advised step reflected upon his own judgment and discretion. And Hilda Vivian\u0027s presence on board promised to lead to endless difficulties and additional dangers before the prisoners were rescued. As these thoughts passed rapidly through his mind Burgoyne watched Miss Vivian from a distance. She no doubt clearly understood the pirate lieutenant\u0027s order, even if the words were somewhat ambiguous; but the girl gave no sign or look to indicate her thoughts. She had dropped quite naturally into the stand-at-ease pose of her companions, all of whom were ready, if needs be, to give their lives to shield her from harm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"After all,\" soliloquized Alwyn, \"there\u0027ll be Angus and Withers to keep an eye on her. And there\u0027s less chance of the old Donibristle being sunk than the pirate, if a British or Yankee cruiser should appear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a decided uncertainty about that \"if\". British cruisers were comparatively rare birds in that part of the North Pacific, and Uncle Sam was content to keep his cruisers within easy distance of the American seaboard, except on rare occasions when events in the Philippines or Hawaii required their presence. As for merchant vessels, they kept rigidly to the recognized routes. Sailing craft had perforce to wander from the narrow path, otherwise there were wide stretches of the Pacific where the blue seas were hardly ever disturbed by a ship\u0027s cutwater. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Donibristle, when overhauled by the Malfilio, was on the recognized Vancouver-Honolulu route. She had cut and was well to the south\u0027ard of the steamer track between \u0027Frisco and Yokohama, and still at some distance north-west of the converging track between \u0027Frisco and Honolulu. During the pursuit she had been forced some miles out of her course, so that any slight hope of being rescued by a chance war-ship was rendered still more remote. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pablo Henriques signalled imperiously to Alwyn to put his orders into execution. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Carry on, Mr. Withers,\" said Burgoyne, without a trace of emotion, although he felt like springing at the throat of the pirate lieutenant. \"Get the firemen—both watches—below.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The men broke ranks and disappeared from view. With them went Hilda, descending the almost vertical slippery steel ladder without the faintest hesitation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You will lower boats,\" ordered Henriques. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But,\" protested Burgoyne, pointing to the shattered and bullet-holed assortment of woodwork in the davits, \"it is useless. They wouldn\u0027t keep us afloat a minute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The pirate lieutenant shrugged his shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That has noddin\u0027 to do with me,\" he remarked callously. \"If dey no float you swim. It not far.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s one way of making us walk the plank, I suppose,\" thought Alwyn; then, without betraying his mistrust, ordered the boats to be swung out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We can make some of them seaworthy, lads,\" he added. \"It\u0027s not far. Those boats that can keep afloat will have to make two trips. The passengers will go in No. 1 lifeboat. She\u0027s the safest I think.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As the seamen moved off to carry out the order, Colonel Vivian turned to the erstwhile Third Officer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is there no chance of my remaining on board?\" he asked hurriedly. \"You see, my daughter—and my wife, lying dead below——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Vivian will be safe enough, I think,\" replied Burgoyne. \"That is provided her secret is kept. I quite understand your anxiety about Mrs. Vivian. Why not ask to be allowed to remain?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Colonel Vivian limped away to make the request. It was humiliating for a British army officer to have to ask a favour of a rascally half-caste pirate, but the thought of having to abandon the body of his wife to be unceremoniously thrown overboard by this horde of coloured ruffians made him put aside his scruples. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" replied Henriques. \"De order is all leave de ship. But I gif you fife minutes to perform de burial of de lady.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so, setting to work rapidly yet reverently, Burgoyne, the purser, and the steward assisted the bereaved colonel to commit the remains to the deep. Under the watchful eyes of a couple of pirates, lest articles or documents of value should be disposed of at the same time, the corpse was swathed in a spare awning, lashed up, and weighted with a length of chain. The steward produced a Prayer Book and handed it to the temporary skipper. Burgoyne, noting that a bare ninety seconds remained, read a few portions of the burial service, then, with every man of the Donibristle\u0027s crew within sight knocking off work and standing bareheaded, the mortal remains of Mrs. Vivian were committed to the deep. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" thought Alwyn, as he turned away, \"perhaps it was as well that Miss Vivian did go below. There are limits even to the endurance of human nature.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The voice of the pirate lieutenant bawling out orders in broken English attracted Burgoyne\u0027s attention. A signal had just been received from the Malfilio countermanding the previous order, and instructing Henriques to send the prisoners below and get under way. So the boats were swung in again and secured. \\n\\n \\n\\n By the time that this work was completed, and before the British deck-hands and officers could be sent below, a faint buzzing that momentarily increased caused all hands to look skywards. Approaching the Malfilio at a high speed was a small seaplane. At first Burgoyne and many of his comrades thought that it was a naval scout, and that deliverance was at hand; but the fact that no hostile demonstration was made on the pirate cruiser quickly banished this hope. \\n\\n \\n\\n The seaplane was winding in a wireless aerial as she circled round the Malfilio. Without the slightest doubt it was by this means that the Malfilio had been placed in touch with her prey. The fuselage was dumpy and the monoplane spare and small, and by the corrugations of the wings Burgoyne rightly concluded that they were of metal. She was of an earlier type with a single motor of comparatively low power —but quite sufficient to enable her to be a valuable adjunct to the pirate cruiser. \\n\\n \\n\\n The \"winding-in\" completed, the seaplane alighted on the surface and \"taxi-ed\" alongside the Malfilio. A derrick swung outwards from the cruiser, and a steel wire rope was deftly shackled to the eyebolt of a \"gravity band\" round the fuselage. Even as the machine rose from the water, dangling at the end of a wire rope, her wings swung back and folded themselves against the body, and in this compact form the aerial scout vanished from sight behind the Malfilio\u0027s superstructure. \\n\\n \\n\\n This much Burgoyne saw before he was compelled to follow the remaining officers and deck-hands, including the Cockney who had been told to stand by the whistle lanyard, and who, during the operation of swinging in the boats, had seen his officer\u0027s signal for recall. \\n\\n \\n\\n Once \u0027tween decks, the men were herded for\u0027ard and locked up in the forepeak, an armed pirate being stationed on the hatchway. The remnant of officers and the passengers were ordered aft, and secured in the steerage, where they found Captain Blair, Mostyn, and the other wounded. There were four cabins at their disposal, the whole separated from the rest of the ship by a transverse bulkhead in which was a single sliding door. Outside this a sentry was posted, while, as an additional precaution, that for some reason was not taken in the case of the men, four villainous-looking Orientals, armed to the teeth, were stationed with the prisoners. The dead-lights were screwed into the scuttles, and the captives warned that any attempt at tampering with them would be punishable with death; and, since the electric light had failed, the steerage was dimly illuminated by half a dozen oil-lamps. \\n\\n \\n\\n The door had not been locked more than a couple of minutes before the prisoners heard the thresh of the twin propellers. The S.S. Donibristle under her new masters was steaming ahead, under greatly reduced speed, in the wake of the pirate cruiser Malfilio—but whither? \\n\\n \\n\\n The reaction of the excitement and peril of the last few hours now set in, and a state of lethargy took possession of most of the prisoners. The hot, confined, ill-ventilated space, the reek of iodoform pervading everything, and a sheer hunger and fatigue all combined to suppress any desire for conversation. For some hours the silence was broken only by the moans of the wounded and the clank of the freshwater pump, as the parched men quenched their burning thirst with frequent and copious draughts, while constantly their Chinese guards, with their expressionless yellow faces and slanting eyes, paced to and fro, like sinister demons from another world. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hour after hour passed. Darkness succeeded daylight. At intervals the guards were changed, and at about nine o\u0027clock a negro brought in a small sack of ship\u0027s biscuits. \\n\\n \\n\\n About midnight Miles attempted to start a conversation by grumbling to Tarrant about the bad methods of the Mercantile Marine, and the British Columbian and Chinese Line in particular, in allowing ships to leave port in a defenceless condition. Tarrant promptly \"shut him up\", amidst a murmur of applause from the men in the vicinity, for the drummer\u0027s anxiety for his own safety, and disregard of the plight of his companions, had not failed to be noticed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s the way to deal with him, Mr. Tarrant,\" remarked Alwyn. \"We\u0027ve quite enough to put up with without having to listen to the yapping and whining of a spiritless fellow like that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, it\u0027s deucedly unfortunate,\" said Tarrant, \"but so far we haven\u0027t been badly treated.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" agreed Burgoyne, \"we haven\u0027t. They\u0027ve spared our lives, although that rather puzzles me. One would have thought that, being pirates, they would emulate the Hun and do the \u0027spurlos versenkt\u0027 stunt. Piracy is a hanging matter, and having gone thus far it\u0027s a wonder they didn\u0027t go the whole hog. However, they haven\u0027t and I don\u0027t think they will now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I always thought that there was no such thing as piracy nowadays,\" remarked the purser, \"at least only in a small way in the China seas.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you\u0027ll have to revise your ideas, Holmes,\" rejoined Burgoyne. \"It came as a shock to all of us. One of the aftermaths of the Great War, I suppose, and the very audacity of it brings temporary—let us hope—success. This game can\u0027t last long. Once the world gets wind of it there\u0027ll be British, Yankee, and Jap light cruisers and destroyers on the Malfilio\u0027s heels, and she\u0027ll be rounded up in double quick time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wonder where they are taking us,\" said Tarrant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That I can\u0027t say,\" replied Alwyn. \"But, if it\u0027s any information to you, I can inform you that we\u0027ve been steaming roughly nor\u0027west for the last six hours.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you know that?\" inquired Branscombe in astonishment. \"Here we are cooped up without a chance of seeing a single star, and yet——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve a compass, laddie,\" replied Burgoyne. \"A liquid pocket compass, and I mean to stick to it as long as I jolly well can. Naturally, in playing a billiard handicap, a fellow....\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He continued discoursing upon the irrelevant subject of billiards for more than a minute, his companions expressing no surprise at the sudden change of topic. It was not until the Chinese sentry had passed and was out of earshot, that the former theme was resumed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That chap might understand English,\" observed Burgoyne. \"Well, I can also tell you this; if we hold on our course sufficiently long, we\u0027ll fetch up on one of the Aleutian Islands, or else on the coast of Kamtchatka.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Give me something a little warmer,\" protested Tarrant. \"There\u0027s nothing like getting used——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A voice, hoarse, masterful, and at the same time, slightly incoherent, interrupted the conclave. Captain Blair was recovering consciousness and making a considerable song about it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Angus,\" he shouted, \"can\u0027t you whack her up a bit more? Three knots if you burst. The cowardly skunks—women on board, and the villains are shelling us. Mr. Angus, are you there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In a trice Burgoyne was by the Old Man\u0027s side, fearful lest he should divulge the fact to the pirate that there had been more than one woman on board. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s all right, sir,\" he said soothingly. \"We\u0027ve got the heels of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eh?\" exclaimed the skipper. \"Who\u0027s that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Burgoyne, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And we\u0027ve given \u0027em the slip, eh? Yes, the firing\u0027s stopped right enough. Where am I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In good hands,\" replied Alwyn. \"You\u0027ve been knocked about a bit, but Holmes and the steward have patched you up all right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I remember,\" rejoined Captain Blair. \"I told you to carry on, and everything\u0027s O.K.?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reassured on that point, the Old Man gave a long sigh, closed his eyes, and sank into a sound slumber. \\n\\n \\n\\n Towards morning Burgoyne noticed, by consulting his compass, that the Donibristle had altered her course and was steering due west. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kamtchatka\u0027s off,\" he announced, as Tarrant appeared munching a biscuit. \"They\u0027ve altered course four points to the west\u0027ard.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that means?\" asked the Consular Service man. \"That we make Japan if we carry on as we are going,\" replied Alwyn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027m; s\u0027 long as they land me within easy distance of my destination I welcome the alteration,\" observed Tarrant. \"But perhaps they\u0027re making for a coral island or something of that sort. Are there any hereabouts?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Evidently they mean to give Hawaii a wide berth,\" said Burgoyne. \"After that there are only a few small islands—the Ocean Islands they\u0027re called. I\u0027ve never been there, because they lie to the nor\u0027ard of our regular track and a good way south of the Yokohama-San Francisco route.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Uninhabited?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Burgoyne shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve told you all I know,\" he asserted. \"It isn\u0027t much. But we\u0027ll find out in due course, I expect.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shortly afterwards the bulkhead door was unlocked, and Withers was unceremoniously shown in. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s for brekker?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m ravenous.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ship\u0027s biscuit and lukewarm water, old son,\" replied Branscombe. \"What are you doing here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The blighters are letting us work watch and watch,\" said the Second Engineer, voraciously biting off chunks of the tough biscuit. \"I\u0027ve had my stand-easy, and they sent me aft to get some grub before I\u0027m on again. Angus will be here in another quarter of an hour.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And the men?\" asked Burgoyne \"How are they standing it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fine, everything considered,\" replied Withers \"Even though they are being fed on rice as if they were Chinks.\" He glanced at the Chinese guards. They were bunched together close to the bulkhead door, resuming an interrupted game of cards. \"And Miss Vivian is just splendid,\" he continued lowering his voice. \"We rigged her up a sort of caboose under one of the intake ventilators. She told Angus that she\u0027d slept well, but she couldn\u0027t tackle rice and cold water, so I\u0027m going to fill my pockets with biscuits for her. No objections, I hope?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do the pirates worry you much?\" asked Branscombe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Directly—no; indirectly—yes,\" was the reply. \"They don\u0027t post guards in the engine-room, which is a blessing; but they are continually calling for more revolutions. Perhaps they imagine we\u0027re a South American republic—how\u0027s that for a joke, Branscombe?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Feeble,\" was the reply, \"but get on with it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing much to get on with,\" continued the Second Engineer. \"There was a talk of tinkering with the high-pressure slide-valves and stopping the engines, only Angus said that, if the Donibristle did break down, the cruiser would doubtless remove the prize crew and send her to the bottom—and us as well. So that didn\u0027t come off. But, I say, who\u0027s eating chocolate?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No one,\" replied Alwyn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re wrong, old son,\" he replied presently, \"or perhaps I ought to say \u0027Mr. Burgoyne\u0027 now? Fact remains, I smell chocolate. The air\u0027s stiff with it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hanged if I can whiff it,\" exclaimed Alwyn. \"Iodoform, yes, but not chocolate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For answer the Second Engineer grasped Burgoyne\u0027s arm and led him across the compartment. With a sense of smell almost as acute as that of a dog, he led Alwyn to a dark corner formed by the angle of one of the cabin bulkheads with the ship\u0027s side. There, seated on an upturned bucket, was Miles—and there was no doubt now as to the reek of chocolate. Filled with indignation at the gross selfishness of the drummer, Burgoyne held out his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll trouble you to hand over what\u0027s left,\" he said curtly. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Miles was not going to surrender his spoils without protest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, what for?\" he asked. \"If I took the precaution to lay in a stock, that is my affair.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Burgoyne with difficulty restrained his temper. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At once,\" he exclaimed sternly. Having been trained from his early youth to manage men, he was not going to stand any nonsense from a coward. \\n\\n \\n\\n The passenger gasped but complied. Burgoyne found himself possessed of a slab of chocolate weighing nearly a pound. The wretched fellow, taking advantage of the fact that during the chase the steward\u0027s pantry was unattended, had taken and concealed the toothsome stuff. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Holmes!\" sang out the Third Officer \\n\\n \\n\\n The purser appeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is part of the ship\u0027s stores, is it not?\" inquired Burgoyne. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Holmes replied in the affirmative, volunteering the additional information that the chocolate was stamped with the company\u0027s initials—a fact that in his haste the pilferer had overlooked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Right-o, Mr. Holmes,\" continued Alwyn. \"That leaves me with a clear conscience. Take charge of the stuff and issue it out in equal shares to everyone aft. Keep back a share for Mr. Angus and the Third Engineer when they arrive.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But when Withers returned to the engine-room his pockets were bulging—not only with biscuits, but with small cubes of chocolate. Spontaneously, and almost without exception, every temporary occupant of the steerage had given up his share to Hilda Vivian. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1610/47702.html","bookId":1247,"book":{"id":1247,"title":"The Third Officer","description":"简介： To the accompaniment of a pungent whiff of hot oil, a miniature cascade of coal dust and frozen snow, and the rasping sound of the derrick chain, the last of the cargo for No. 3 hold of the S.S.
