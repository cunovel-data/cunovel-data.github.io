{"id":13144,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII And Last","content":"The Commodore received a rousing reception when he landed to inspect the captured island, but his welcome was completely outclassed by the frantic demonstration that greeted Burgoyne, Mostyn, and Minalto. The three well-groomed, clean-shaven men were almost swept off their feet by the excited mob of ragged, bearded scarecrows who had been their shipmates. \n \n Waist deep in water the seamen had waded out to greet the heroes of the moment. Shoulder high they bore their three comrades through the shelving tunnel, making the confined space ring with cheers and shouts of boisterous delight. \n \n At the upper entrance Burgoyne and his companions were met by Captain Blair. \n \n \"So you pulled it off all right,\" exclaimed the Old Man. \n \n \"Yes, sir,\" replied Alwyn. \n \n \"And Miss Vivian?\" \n \n \"Safe in Sydney,\" declared Burgoyne. \"But where\u0027s Colonel Vivian?\" \n \n \"Here I am, Mr. Burgoyne,\" replied the Colonel, making his way through the press. He seized the Third Officer\u0027s hand and wrung it. He could say no more. \n \n \"Miss Vivian is quite all right, sir,\" reported Burgoyne. \"She is now with relations of mine at Sydney.\" \n \n Very briefly Burgoyne related the story of the adventures of the life-boat and their rescue by the Titania. Mostyn, surrounded by another mob, was similarly engaged, while Minalto was holding forth to a group of eager listeners as he sung the praises of Alwyn Burgoyne and his companions, while Swayne and O\u0027Loghlin came in for a full share of appreciation and attention on the part of the former captives of the secret base. \n \n The appearance of a lieutenant of the Armadale interrupted the demonstrations. \n \n \"When you\u0027ve finished with your jamboree, gentlemen,\" he observed pleasantly, \"the Commodore would like to see the officers of the three captured ships.\" \n \n \"Say!\" exclaimed Captain Davis, \"can\u0027t he give us time to have a hair-cut and shave?\" \n \n The lieutenant laughed. \n \n \"He won\u0027t mind,\" he replied. \"\u0027Sides, you might catch cold, skipper, if you took all that lot off at once.\" \n \n The conference was of a brief yet important nature. The captains of the three merchantmen were asked where they wished to be taken—whether to Honolulu or to Sydney. Captain Blair and most of the officers of the Donibristle chose Honolulu, whence they could obtain a passage to Esquimalt, and from there to Vancouver. The skipper of the Kittiwake declined both offers, saying that he preferred to sail in his own craft, and Angus and Withers offered to fill vacancies in the Kittiwake\u0027s engine-room staff. Finally the Alvarado\u0027s Old Man expressed a belief that he, too, could recondition his ship and take her back to \u0027Frisco. \n \n \"Good man!\" exclaimed the Commodore. \"If I were in your place, by Jove! I\u0027d do the same. We\u0027ll be here for another six or seven days, so if you want any assistance my artificers are at your disposal.\" \n \n \"And if—\" added Captain Davis to the skipper of the Alvarado. \"And if you aren\u0027t ready by that time I\u0027ll tow you across to Hilo or Honolulu.\" \n \n When the conference was over the Commodore asked Burgoyne to remain. \n \n \"Mr. Burgoyne,\" he began without any preliminaries, \"are you fond of the Merchant Service?\" \n \n \"I am, sir,\" replied Alwyn. \"It\u0027s a life afloat.\" \n \n \"You would prefer the Navy, I take it?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir; but that is——\". He broke off, unable to express his thoughts. \n \n \"Out of the question, eh?\" added the Commodore. \"I think not. How would a commission in the Australian Navy appeal to you?\" \n \n Burgoyne\u0027s eyes sparkled. \n \n \"If it could be managed, sir,\" he replied. \n \n \"I think it can be,\" said the Commodore. \"We\u0027ll leave it at that for the present. I can offer you a passage back to Sydney, and I think you will do well to accept.\" \n \n \"Then you think there is a chance, sir?\" \n \n \"Most certainly. Apart from the valuable services you have rendered to the expedition, the fact that you have been trained for the British Navy is in your favour.\" \n \n Burgoyne thanked the Commodore and withdrew, feeling as if he were walking on air. If the \"stunt\" came off he would be once more an officer of the Royal Navy, although in a branch that displays on its ensign the Southern Cross. \n \n During the next few days the utmost activity prevailed on the island. Demolition parties blew up the gun-pits and levelled the defences. The store-houses were overhauled, and the plunder carefully examined and labelled with a view to restoring it to its lawful owners. Work, too, proceeded at high pressure on the Kittiwake and Alvarado, and both vessels soon looked like being able to get away under their own steam. \n \n At length the day fixed for the departure of the Australian Squadron arrived. In the morning there was a ceremonial parade ashore, attended by every available man of the warships backed up by the crews of the three merchant vessels. \n \n Amidst the ringing cheers of the officers and men, the union Jack was hoisted, and the secret base taken over as a dependency of the Commonwealth of Australia. \n \n The few surviving members of Ramon Porfirio\u0027s mob were then embarked on board the seaplane carrier. A garrison of fifty volunteers from the squadron was left to take charge of the new acquisition, together with a few of the merchant seamen, who, curiously enough, showed no immediate desire to quit the island. \n \n One of the destroyers was ordered to Honolulu to take the survivors of the Donibristle\u0027s crew. Colonel Vivian and Mr. Tarrant had accepted the Commodore\u0027s offer to give them a passage to Australia. \n \n Phil Branscombe eyed his chum curiously when Burgoyne told him of his intention to return to Sydney. \n \n \"I think I know why you\u0027re shaping that course, old bird,\" he remarked sagely. \n \n \"I bet you don\u0027t, any old way,\" rejoined Alwyn. \n \n \"Oh, anyone would know that,\" continued Phil. \"There\u0027s a lady in the case. Look here, I\u0027ll bet you a hundred Havanas that you\u0027ll be engaged to Miss Vivian within the next three months?\" \n \n \"Done,\" agreed Burgoyne. He was none too certain that Phil would lose; on the other hand if Branscombe won, he, Alwyn, would pay up most cheerfully. \n \n \"Right-o!\" exclaimed Branscombe. \"And the best of luck to you, old bird. Send \u0027em along to me care of the Company\u0027s agent at Vancouver.\" \n \n At noon the Kittiwake and the Alvarado, having raised steam, weighed anchor and proceeded, escorted by a destroyer conveying the majority of the Donibristle\u0027s crew. \n \n An hour later the Armadale and the rest of the squadron got under way, and soon the island—the secret base no longer—vanished beneath the horizon. \n \n During the voyage Colonel Vivian mentioned to Alwyn that he had had enough of the sea to last him for a good many years, and that he proposed buying a property somewhere in the neighbourhood of Sydney. \n \n \"Quite a sound scheme, that, sir,\" observed Burgoyne. \n \n \"I think so,\" agreed the Colonel. \"And, of course, we may see a good deal of you, especially if you get a berth on a liner calling at the principal Australian ports.\" \n \n \n Three weeks after the Armadale\u0027s arrival at Port Jackson, Alwyn Burgoyne received his papers appointing him, as a full-blown lieutenant of the Royal Australian Navy, to the light cruiser Brisbane. \n \n He received the official notification at 11 a.m. At once he proceeded to Penrith, where Colonel Vivian had purchased a small but picturesque house. At ten in the evening, looking absolutely pleased with himself and the world at large, Burgoyne was writing an order for a hundred choice Havanas to be sent per registered post to an address in far-off Vancouver. \n \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1610/47728.html","bookId":1247,"book":{"id":1247,"title":"The Third Officer","description":"简介： To the accompaniment of a pungent whiff of hot oil, a miniature cascade of coal dust and frozen snow, and the rasping sound of the derrick chain, the last of the cargo for No. 3 hold of the S.S.
