{"id":13139,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII Farewell to Swan Island","content":"Launching the dinghy, Burgoyne and his companions rowed off to the schooner. It was now close on high water and the wind had dropped to almost a flat calm. Laboriously they manned the winch until the cable was up and down, then for half an hour they toiled before they succeeded in breaking out the heavy anchor from the tenacious hold of the bed of the lagoon. Then followed a strenuous task under the broiling rays of the afternoon sun as they towed the vessel into the creek. \n \n By that time Burgoyne realized that he had been over sanguine in his surmise. He had not taken into account the almost inevitable hitches in his plans, and he had forgotten the now patent fact that none of them had had a good sleep for the last thirty hours. \n \n \"She\u0027ll lie there nicely,\" he decided, as the anchor was let go and a stout warp taken ashore and made fast to a sturdy palm tree. \"We\u0027ll spend the rest of the day making everything ship-shape, but I don\u0027t quite fancy sleeping aboard to-night.\" \n \n The work of cleansing this maritime Augean stables proceeded with a will, for the schooner was indescribably filthy both on deck and below. Her paraffin motor was in a terribly neglected state, so that it was a source of wonder to Alwyn and Peter that the pirates ever succeeded in getting the engine to perform duty at all. Most of the running gear was good, having been renewed from cordage taken from the captured merchantmen; but the sails, though serviceable in light winds, did not appear to be capable of standing up to a stiff blow. \n \n Of provisions they found a liberal quantity, although the quality left much to be desired. Aided by stores from the island, the new crew ought to be able to subsist comfortably for a month without having to reprovision the grub-lockers. Particularly acceptable were air-tight canisters of tea, coffee, and cocoa, boxes of sugar, and an unopened crate of condensed milk, as well as a variety of cooking utensils. \n \n \"Knock off time!\" declared Burgoyne, to the relief of his weary and tired companions, although they had no cause for complaint that he had shirked his fair share. \"We\u0027ll turn in in the cave to-night, since most of our gear\u0027s there. Bring that grub along, Jasper; I\u0027ll see to the kettle and the tea-pot; Peter, you cart along the knives, and milk, sugar, and tea. We\u0027re going to surprise Miss Vivian when she wakes up.\" \n \n Soon after they landed a fire was blazing merrily. While the kettle was boiling Mostyn made some tea-cups by cutting out a section of several coco-nut shells. Although there were enamelled tea-cups in plenty on board, the three men could not bring themselves to make use of them. They were not fastidious, but they drew the line at drinking out of cups used by pirates. \n \n Compared with the food to which they had been accustomed during their captivity at the secret base and their subsequent escape, the meal promised to be a sumptuous one. \n \n When all was in readiness they roused Hilda from her slumbers. Beyond a slight stiffness she felt little the worse for her alarming experience. A refreshing sleep had driven away her headache, and, to quote her own words, she felt ready to go anywhere or do anything. \n \n \"Then, how about tea?\" asked Burgoyne. \"Real tea?\" \n \n Hilda looked a bit doubtful. She rather fancied that Burgoyne was \"chipping her\". Then she caught a whiff of the fragrant odour as Peter poured the boiling water on to the tea. \n \n \"Oh, how nice!\" she exclaimed enthusiastically, and almost in the same breath she added anxiously: \"but I hope you washed the tea-pot thoroughly?\" \n \n The meal over, another surprise was forthcoming when Minalto proudly produced a tin of tobacco and some cigarette papers, which he had found in the after-cabin of the schooner. With unexpected dexterity Jasper\u0027s huge and clumsy-looking fingers rolled half a dozen cigarettes, and soon the three men were enjoying the long-denied luxury of smoking the fragrant weed; while Hilda, not to be left out in the cold, proceeded to make appetizing coco-nut cakes of flour, sugar, and grated nuts, which she baked on a piece of sheet iron over the fire. \n \n Early next morning all hands were up and doing. Each had his or her allotted task: the men to overhaul and clean out the schooner, while Hilda baked biscuits and boiled ham for the voyage. \n \n By noon the schooner was presentable. The decks had been scrubbed down with sand and water, the paintwork in both cabins washed down, and everything well aired. Mostyn tackled the motor, an American kerosene engine, taking down the four cylinders, cleaning plugs and magneto, and overhauling the thoroughly dirty carburettor. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know what her consumption is,\" he observed to Burgoyne, \"but assuming that it is three gallons an hour, we have only enough fuel for a twenty-four hours\u0027 run.\" \n \n \"Ought to be enough unless we strike bad luck in the way of calms,\" replied Alwyn. \"We\u0027ll carry on under sail whenever possible, and only use the motor in cases of emergency. Think she\u0027ll fire?\" \n \n \"We\u0027ll try her,\" said Mostyn hopefully. \"We can declutch, but we can\u0027t go astern. Not that that matters very much. Flood the carburettor, old son, while I dope the cylinders. Yes, that\u0027s the petrol-tap. When she\u0027s warm we can change over to paraffin. Ready?\" \n \n A dozen swings of the starting-handle failed to produced the desired effect. The two men, perspiring profusely, looked at one another more in sorrow than in anger. \n \n \"Try advancing the ignition,\" suggested Alwyn. \n \n \"She may back-fire,\" demurred Peter, \"but I\u0027ll risk it. Give her more dope. Sure the carburettor\u0027s flooding?\" \n \n Again they swotted at turning the engine over, Peter at the fly-wheel and Burgoyne at the starting-handle. \n \n \"Obstinate as a mule,\" declared Mostyn. \"Get Jasper to bear a hand, while I \u0027\u0027ot up them plugs\u0027—you remember old Paterson\u0027s recipe for a refractory motor?\" \n \n They heated the sparking-plugs, primed them with petrol, and replaced them. Minalto at the starting-handle heaved until the veins in his forehead looked to be on the point of bursting, but not the faintest sign of an explosion on the part of the motor rewarded his efforts. \n \n \"I say,\" remarked Alwyn; \"I suppose you\u0027ve switched on the ignition?\" \n \n Mostyn pointed to the switch. The knob was down right enough. \n \n \"Swing her again, Jasper,\" said Burgoyne coaxingly. \n \n Placing his fingers on the magneto, Alwyn received what he described as a \"beautiful shock\". \n \n \"The mag\u0027s all right,\" he announced, rubbing his tingling elbow. \"Now, once more, Jasper, while I try the plug terminals.\" \n \n Not the suspicion of a spark was obtainable with any of the four plugs. Burgoyne scratched his head in his perplexity. \n \n \"Faulty insulation, I believe,\" he hazarded. \n \n \"Perhaps the ignition-switch has to be up, not down,\" he said. \"Sometimes they fit the wiring so that the current is \u0027shorted\u0027 and not broken by the switch. Now try.\" \n \n The result surpassed expectations, for the engine back-fired, throwing the starting-handle violently against the roof and barking Minalto\u0027s knuckles into the bargain. But the motor was buzzing round with the precision of a steam-engine. \n \n \"Experientia docet!\" exclaimed Peter, raising his voice above the din of the whirring machinery. \n \n \"Ay, ay, sir,\" agreed Minalto, wiping the back of his hand with a piece of cotton waste. \"Experience does it. Does she kick every time we\u0027m starting her like? Ef so my name\u0027s Johnny Walker this trip.\" \n \n At length Mostyn decided that the initial trial was satisfactory. The ignition was cut off, and the engine clanked into a state of coma. \n \n The midday meal over, the task of conveying the treasured relics of their stay on Swan Island from the cave to the schooner was begun. The provisions were shipped and the water-tanks replenished—the latter a tedious task, since it necessitated twenty journeys between the spring and the schooner By four o\u0027clock in the afternoon, according to the schooner\u0027s chronometer, all was in readiness to heave up anchor and get under way. \n \n \"We\u0027ll be well clear of the reefs before sundown,\" said Burgoyne. \"If we keep her under easy canvas all night and crack on during daylight, we ought to make a fairly good passage.\" \n \n Hilda was below, arranging to her requirements the after-cabin which had been allotted to her. The clanking of the winch, and the grinding of the cable as it came in link by link through the hawse-pipe, warned her that the last material bond with Swan Island was about to be broken. She hurried on deck to find the dinghy already hoisted inboard, and the cable almost hove short. \n \n \"Good enough for the present,\" exclaimed Burgoyne. \"Start up, Peter. Well, Miss Vivian, we\u0027re saying good-bye to the island.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m sorry—and glad,\" replied Hilda. \"We—at least, I have had some good times on Swan Island. Until the pirates came I rather enjoyed it, although the thought that my father and the others were suffering hardships made me feel as if I were wasting time. Not that it could be helped.\" \n \n For a few moments her gaze rested on the blackened slopes of the fire-devastated part of the island; then her eyes travelled in the direction of the still verdant part where the marauding pirates had not left their mark. \n \n She remained silent for a little longer, feasting her eyes on the picturesque scene, then with a sigh she turned abruptly and looked resolutely seaward. \n \n \"All ready, skipper!\" shouted Mostyn from below, as the deck quivered under the rapid impulses of the engine. \n \n Going forward, Burgoyne assisted Minalto to break out and heave up the anchor. Then, leaving Jasper to secure the ponderous \"mud-hook\" in its proper place, Alwyn returned aft to the wheel. \n \n \"Easy ahead.\" \n \n The schooner forged gently through the placid water. A few turns of the wheel steadied her on her course, and in a few minutes she was clear of the inlet and slipping quietly across the lagoon. \n \n Keeping the schooner almost dead slow, Burgoyne nursed her through the narrow southern passage between the reef. Then, porting helm to avoid the ledges off Man-o\u0027-War Island, he steered for the open sea. \n \n Half an hour from the time of getting under way, the schooner was curtsying to the deep blue waters of the Pacific. Ahead as far as the eye could see—and much farther—was a vast expanse of ocean. \n \n \"Do you mind taking her for a few minutes, Miss Vivian?\" asked Burgoyne, standing aside to let the girl grasp the spokes of the wheel. \"Yes, south by west, please.\" \n \n Then, stepping to the motor-room hatchway, he called to Mostyn. \n \n \"Finished with the engines, my festive. All hands make sail.\" \n \n For the next quarter of an hour the three men were busily engaged in hoisting the head-sails, since the wind was almost right aft, and then the fore- and mainsails. In view of the approach of night, they decided to dispense with the jib-headed top-sails. Not until the canvas was well peaked up, and the falls of the halliards neatly coiled down, did the crew relax their efforts, and by that time the highest part of Swan Island had vanished in the gathering darkness. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1610/47723.html","bookId":1247,"book":{"id":1247,"title":"The Third Officer","description":"简介： To the accompaniment of a pungent whiff of hot oil, a miniature cascade of coal dust and frozen snow, and the rasping sound of the derrick chain, the last of the cargo for No. 3 hold of the S.S.
