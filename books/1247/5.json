{"id":13117,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V Captured","content":"\"Very good, sir!\" Fired by the dogged bravery of the skipper, Alwyn stood erect and prepared to semaphore a reply of defiance, but before he could do so Captain Blair called to him. \"After all\u0027s said and done, Burgoyne,\" said the Old Man feebly, \"we\u0027ve put up a good fight. No one can deny that. And there are women aboard, though p\u0027raps \u0027twould be best——\" His voice sank and he muttered a few inaudible sentences. \"I\u0027m slipping my cable,\" he continued, his voice gaining strength, \"so it doesn\u0027t much matter to me. There are the others to consider—what\u0027s left of them. Quarter, they promised?\" \"Aye, aye, sir!\" \"Then we\u0027ll chuck up the sponge. Tell the villains we\u0027ll surrender. If they don\u0027t keep their word (now make sure you understand) tell Angus to stand by, and if there\u0027s any shooting he\u0027s to open the Kingston valves.\" \"Aye, aye, sir,\" agreed the Third Officer. He realized that if the pirates failed to keep faith in the matter of quarter, then the Donibristle—the prize they so greatly desired—would be sunk by the simple expedient of opening the underwater valves. \"We surrender,\" semaphored Burgoyne. It was a hateful task, but upon reflection he agreed with his skipper\u0027s amended decision. The Donibristle had not thrown up the sponge without a gallant resistance dearly paid for in human lives. It remained to be seen whether the terms of surrender would be honoured by the horde of polyglot pirates. Gripping the bridge-rail Burgoyne shouted out the order: \"All hands on deck.\" The summons was obeyed promptly, but how few responded to it! There was Branscombe, with his arm in a sling and an ugly gash on his cheek; little Perkins, the Fifth Officer, who had never before smelt powder; Holmes, the purser, and Adams, the steward, both looking like butchers after tending the wounded; Heatherington, the junior wireless operator; and fifteen of the deck-hands, several of whom bore visible signs of the gruelling they had undergone. In addition were Withers and Nuttall and seventeen firemen of the \"watch-below\", the rest under Angus remaining at their posts in the engine- and boiler-rooms. Of the rest of the officers and crew eleven had been killed outright or mortally wounded, including the First and Second Officers, and close on twenty hit. The officers and men who had fallen in on the boat-deck, unaware of the trend of events, were watching the pirate with puzzled looks. Burgoyne went to the skipper to obtain further instructions before obtaining assistance in order to take him below. Captain Blair was unconscious. Wounded in half a dozen places, he had carried on until the ship was no longer his to command. As senior surviving deck officer, Alwyn was now responsible for the act of surrender. \"We\u0027ve given in,\" he announced to the assembled men. \"There was no help for it. The cruiser has promised us quarter. Lower the ensign.\" As the torn, tattered, and smoke-begrimed Red Ensign was lowered and untoggled, wild yells burst from the throats of the ruffian crew. They did not know how to cheer; they could not if they did. It could only be compared with a concerted roar of a hundred wild beasts. The shouts ceased, not abruptly, but in a long-drawn-out howl. The captain of the pirate cruiser was shouting himself hoarse in an endeavour to obtain silence. When comparative quiet had been gained, he stepped to the end of the bridge and raised a megaphone. \"Ship Donibristle!\" he shouted. \"Obtain way off ze ship an stan\u0027 by to receive boats.\" \"Aye, aye!\" replied Burgoyne. Hitherto the Donibristle had been forging ahead at her present maximum speed, which by this time was a bare five knots; while the pirate cruiser had slowed down to the same speed, causing her to yaw horribly. For the first time Burgoyne noticed that the engine-room telegraph was no longer workable. The voice-tube, however, was intact. \"Mr. Angus,\" he began. \"Aye, it\u0027s Angus,\" replied that worthy\u0027s rolling voice \"Is\u0027t Captain Blair speakin\u0027?\" \"No, Burgoyne,\" replied the temporarily promoted Third. \"The skipper\u0027s hit. We\u0027re down and out. Stop both engines, and——\" \"Weel?\" asked the Chief Engineer with more alacrity than he usually displayed. \"Stand by the Kingston valves. The villains have promised to spare our lives, but you never know. So if you hear one blast on the whistle, open the valves and take your chance. Do you understand?\" \"Deed aye,\" replied Angus. Presently the throb of the twin propellers ceased. The Donibristle carried way for nearly a mile before she stopped. Her head fell off as she rolled gently in the trough of the long crestless waves. The cruiser also stopped, and a couple of boats were swung out, manned, and lowered. Burgoyne had very little time to complete his preparations, but he made the best of those precious moments. Captain Blair was carried below, with the purser and the steward to attend him. The rest of the engine-room staff, with the exception of Angus, were mustered on deck. Calling one of the hands, a reliable and intelligent Cockney, Alwyn stationed him on the bridge, telling him to keep out of sight as much as possible. \"If those fellows start shooting us down,\" he said, \"they won\u0027t waste much time about it. Now keep a sharp look-out. At the first sign tug that whistle lanyard for all you\u0027re worth, then shift for yourself if you can, and the best of luck.\" Burgoyne\u0027s next step was to send Branscombe to bring the passengers on deck. He watched intently as they ascended the companion-ladder, Tarrant and the Fourth Officer assisting Colonel Vivian, and Miles furtively following. But to his keen disappointment and alarm there was no sign of Hilda Vivian. Mental pictures of the ruffianly horde finding the girl below filled him with apprehension. \"Where\u0027s Miss Vivian?\" asked Alwyn anxiously. A suspicion of a smile showed itself on the Fourth Officer\u0027s features. \"It\u0027s all right, old man,\" he explained. \"There she is; three from the end of the rear rank of firemen.\" Burgoyne gasped. \"Thought I told her to shove on Mostyn\u0027s kit,\" he exclaimed. \"Don\u0027t you see, she\u0027ll have to—to keep with the engine-room crowd.\" \"Jolly sight safer,\" declared Branscombe. \"She\u0027d attract attention with the few of us who are left. Her father agreed with me. \u0027Sides, all hands know, and they\u0027re white men, every man jack of \u0027em.\" \"P\u0027raps you\u0027re right,\" conceded Burgoyne, and as he gave another look he felt convinced that the amended plan was the thing. Unless an unfortunate fluke occurred or, what was most unlikely, someone \"gave her away\" the pirates would never recognize the slender fireman with closely-cropped hair and begrimed features, and rigged out in an ill-fitting greasy suit of blue dungarees, as a girl of gentle birth. There was certainly nothing in her demeanour to betray her. She was standing in a line with the men, outwardly as stolid as the rest. Drawing a small plated revolver from his hip-pocket—it was a six-chambered .22 weapon of neat workmanship—Burgoyne thrust it inside his sock, jamming the muzzle between the inside of his boot and his ankle. For the first time he felt grateful to the steward for having spilt ink over both pairs of deck-shoes, otherwise he would not have been wearing boots, and another hiding-place for the handy little weapon would not have promised to be so convenient. The leading boat from the pirate cruiser ran alongside, and about twenty men, armed to the teeth, swarmed up the Donibristle\u0027s side, followed (not led) by a swarthy, black-bearded individual wearing a cocked hat, a blue tunic, with a lavish display of gold lace, a black and crimson scarf round his waist, and a pair of duck trousers with white canvas gaiters. From his belt hung a cavalry officer\u0027s sword, while in his kid-gloved right hand he grasped an automatic pistol. The boarding-party consisted of men of half a dozen nationalities, and at least three totally distinct types of colour. There were Chinese, blue-smocked and wearing straw hats and black wooden shoes, negroes, bare to the waist, Creoles and half-breeds from various South American states, a couple of South Sea Island Kanakas, and a gigantic Malay armed with a kriss and a magazine rifle. Bunched together they eyed the motionless crew of the Donibristle so fiercely that Burgoyne momentarily expected to find them slashing, hewing, and shooting down their helpless, unarmed captives. The pirate officer stepped forward in the most approved melodramatic manner. \"Me Pablo Henriques, tiente po—dat premier lieutenant—ob cruiser Malfilio,\" he announced. \"Se?or Ramon Porfirio him capitano. Now I take command ob de—de——\" He paused, unable to pronounce the name. \"—ob dis ship,\" he continued. \"If you no give trouble den all vell. If you do, den dis.\" He drew one finger across his throat with a guttural cluck and pointed significantly over the side. The stolid-faced prisoners hardly moved a muscle. With no immediate danger in prospect, provided the pirate kept his word, they were content to let events shape themselves, confident that in the long run the lawful keepers of the peace on the High Seas would adjust matters in the form of a running noose round the neck of each of the pirate crew. \"Now tell me,\" continued Henriques, addressing Burgoyne. \"You no capitan; where am he?\" \"Wounded,\" replied Alwyn briefly. \"Bueno. He make to ram us,\" rejoined the half-caste lieutenant. \"Capitano Ramon Porfirio him angry, so we shoot. Say, is dis all der crew?\" \"No,\" replied Burgoyne steadily. \"There are several wounded below. Also the Chief Engineer is in the engine-room.\" Henriques darted a glance of suspicion at the British officer. \"Wa for?\" he demanded sharply. Burgoyne returned his look calmly. \"He has to watch the steam-gauges,\" he replied. \"It might be awkward for us if an explosion occurred.\" It was an answer that served a two-fold purpose. Not only had Burgoyne given the pirate lieutenant a satisfactory reason for the Chief Engineer\u0027s presence in the engine-room, but he had, perhaps unknowingly, shown a certain amount of anxiety for the safety of the ship. Consequently any suspicion on the part of Pablo Henriques that the crew of the Donibristle had arranged to destroy the vessel, the boarding-party, and themselves was totally dispelled. \"Ver\u0027 good!\" he exclaimed, satisfied with the explanation. \"Now, wher\u0027 are de documentos—de papairs?\" Burgoyne shook his head and pointed to the wreckage of the chart-house. \"Your fire was so accurate that the ship\u0027s papers are lost,\" he replied. As a matter of fact Captain Blair had weighted them with a lead-line and sinker, and had dropped them overboard almost directly the Malfilio had hoisted the ID signal. They were several miles astern and fathoms deep in the Pacific. A string of questions followed. What was the nature of the cargo? The amount of coal in the bunkers? Any infectious disease? How many passengers? All these questions Burgoyne answered promptly He was anxious not to cause trouble and give the pirates an excuse for brutality and perhaps massacre. \"Four,\" he replied in answer to the last question. \"One, a lady, lies dead below. She died during the firing.\" Pablo Henriques shrugged his shoulders. That information interested him hardly at all. \"You vill tell your men,\" he ordered, \"to give up all arms an knifes. If we find any after late, den\u0027 we kill \u0027em.\" The young officer gave the word, and the crew deposited their knives upon the deck. Firearms they did not possess, but of the officers, Withers and Branscombe each gave up an automatic and a few rounds of ammunition. Burgoyne took the risk and retained his revolver. \"Now I make search every man,\" declared Henriques, smiling sardonically. \"I jus\u0027 make certain.\" Fortunately a signal was being made by the Malfilio, and Henriques\u0027 attention was diverted. By the time the message was completed and acknowledged, the pirate lieutenant had either forgotten his intention of having the prisoners searched, or else something of more pressing nature required attention. Accompanied by three or four of the pirates Henriques went below. He was away for about five minutes, during which time the Malay ostentatiously whetted the already keen edges of his kriss. Noting the act, Burgoyne registered a vow that, should the pirates commence a massacre, he would take care that the yellow ruffian would be the recipient of the first of the six bullets in his revolver. Presently the grotesquely attired Henriques returned with much sabre-rattling. \"De firemans here vill go below an\u0027 keep up de steam,\" he ordered. \"Ebbery one of de firemans. De odders dey vill go prisoners on board de Malfilio.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1610/47701.html","bookId":1247,"book":{"id":1247,"title":"The Third Officer","description":"简介： To the accompaniment of a pungent whiff of hot oil, a miniature cascade of coal dust and frozen snow, and the rasping sound of the derrick chain, the last of the cargo for No. 3 hold of the S.S.
