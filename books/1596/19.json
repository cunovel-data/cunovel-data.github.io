Tarr glanced up into Larsson’s strangely colored eyes and then quickly back down at his cup.“I know I’m not much of a bargain for a person like you, and considering the price the Alliance has on my head, it’s probably only a matter of time before I get caught anyway. I-I decided while we were on Ravnia that I don’t want to traffic in love slaves anymore. Even the ones who choose the life.After seeing…after talking to Jaxper and…well, I-I can’t do it anymore, I think.Which means I don’t have a job anymore, really. I can’t be a proper mate and take care of you, you see.” He glanced up at Larsson for his reaction, but Larsson just continued to stare at him. “Don’t look at me that way, baby. II’m sorry, but this was just never going to work out. I have a lot to figure out, and I won’t saddle you with it all. Do you understand?” “Understand?” Larsson knew his voice sounded dull and deadly quiet, but he was too angry to do anything about it. “I understand you think you’re trying to dump me. Is that what you mean?” Tarr stole another quick, surprised look at his face and flinched at whatever he saw there. “Nobyo…I mean, Larsson, please…” “Please what? Listen to more of this shit? Tell me what you see when you look at me, Tygerian. Do I look weak to you?I know you’re a little taller, but do you see me as some kind of half-assed wife? Because this little wifey can mop up the floor with you if I wanted to, and right now I really want to.” “No, Larsson, you don’t…” “I don’t what? Understand?I know exactly what you’re saying and you need to shut the fuck up. Do you really think I need you to take care of me? Or that the Alliance or anybody else is going to keep me away from youafter all I’ve been through with you? Fuck the Alliance and fuck you. As a matter of fact, that sounds like a fine idea right now.If you know what’s good for you, you’ll stand up and drop those trousers and bend yourself over the nearest table, before I do it for you.” Tarr looked startled for a moment and then a slow grin came over his face.“Yes, nobyo,” he said, and got to his feet, unsnapping his pants.He was a little too slow for Larsson’s wolf, so Larssonjerked the trousers down around Tarr’s ankles and pushed him backward so he sat down hard on the table. His fat cock bounced in front of him, slapping his stomach and Larsson licked his lips.“That,” he said, pointing down to Tarr’s cock, “is only for me. You got that?” “Yes, nobyo,” Tarr said, obviously enjoying this side of Larsson. “What…uh…what are you going to do?What if someone walks in on us?” “Then they can either watch me fuck you or turn back around and walk out.I’m about to claim my mate, Tarr, and it’s been too long in coming. I’ve allowed you far too much leeway, and it’s caused nothing but trouble. It’s time to remind you who the alpha is in this relationship.” Tarr looked up at him, beginning to get a little nervous.“Larsson, baby, you know I’ve never…” Larsson wrapped a hand around his cock and stroked slowly up the shaft, making Tarr’s eyes roll back in his head a bit. “I know that.” Larsson pulled a small vial of oil from his pocket. “And I came prepared.” Tarr’s eyes grew round as Larsson continued stroking him. A glistening drop of pre-cum appeared on the tip of Tarr’s beautiful cock and Larsson bent to catch it with his tongue. Tarr groaned aloud and Larsson bent to envelop his cock in his mouth. He managed to take most of it, swallowing him down as Tarr gasped and floundered on the table like a fish out of water. He pulled his rough tongue slowly up his shaft until he reached the head. He gave it a swirling lick as he fondled Tarr’s heavy balls and watched him with satisfaction.“Turn over, Tygerian,” Larsson said in a growly voice. Tarr slowly obeyed him, trembling as he looked over his shoulder at him.“Larsson, nobyo, I…” “Hush,” Larsson said, and opened the vial of oil, spreading it overTarr’s crease and his very tight hole, already clenching and unclenching as he pushed his cock onto the table. “Be still,” he ordered as he slapped each of his pretty ass cheeks and then ran his hand down his crease, rubbing in the oil. “Open up for me.Relax.” “I’m trying,” Tarr said, his voice sounding high-pitched and scared to death. Larsson bent over him and soothed him, kissing up the side of his face and licking at his neck. He eased one well-oiled finger up inside him, stretching him gently. Tarr grimaced at the burn, and held his breath until Larsson made him gasp by putting his tongue in his ear.“Breathe, Tarr. Relax.I want to make this good for you.” “I-I’m trying…” Larsson pushed his finger in farther and crooked it up to find what he hoped would be his prostate. He’d never studied Tygerian anatomy, but he thought it should be approximately…there. Stroking over the small bundle of nerves, he smiled to see Tarr’s reaction. He bucked so hard off the table that he almost dislodged Larsson and he turned wildly to look over his shoulder at him.“Oh my gods, Larsson!” Larsson grinned back at him.“I know.” He gave it another good rubdown and Tarr fell apart, groaning and pushing his cock hard onto the table beneath him. Larsson took the opportunity to push in another finger and stretch him even farther. “Feel good?” Tarr’s answer was a deep groan that was half growl, and Larsson knew he was ready. Splashing a bit more oil on Tarr’s hole, Larsson thrust into him and listened to his groans with a deep satisfaction. This was his mate and he had waited a long time to claim him properly. Carried away, he bit down on the back of Tarr’s neck again, causing him to moan harder, and he angled himself so that his cock rubbed over the spot he’d discovered inside Tarr. It took only a few thrusts before Tarr convulsed helplessly, his velvety-smooth ass tightening almost painfully around Larsson’s cock. The added pressure brought Larsson’s climax and he came hard, shooting his cum deep inside his mate. He pulled out for the last few spurts and sprayed over Tarr’s ass and the backs of his thighs, marking his territory. He collapsed on top of Tarr, almost completely spent, and enjoying the feel of his lover beneath him.“Are you okay?” he managed to say, and Tarr nodded, out of breath and gasping out the words. “Yes, nobyo.” “Do you want me to get a warm cloth to clean you up?” “Yes, nobyo.” Larsson chuckled and rubbed a possessive hand over Tarr’s ass as he got up and stumbled to the sink for a cloth. Coming back with it, he tenderly cleaned his mate and helped him to sit up so he could clean off his groin and the table underneath. “Better get another cloth to clean this table or Jex will be all over us.” “Yes, nobyo.” Tarr shook his head, dazed and confused as the venom raced through his body. It wouldn’t be so intense as the first time, but it was still making Tarr weak and dizzy.“I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I only seem to know how to say one thing—yes, nobyo.” Larsson dropped a kiss on his lips and smiled.“And that’s all you’ll ever need to know.” THE END","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wolf-s-bounty-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-6/page-19.html","bookId":1596,"book":{"id":1596,"title":"Wolf\u0027s Bounty (Love Slaves of the Alphas #6)","description":"Storyline: Wolf\u0027s Bounty (Love Slaves of the Alphas #6) Larsson Balenescu is trying hard to get over the fact that his fated mate is not only a Tygerian, and one of the Alliance’s most bitter enemies, but also the fact that he’s Tarr Bonnet, one of the worst pirates and sex slave traffickers in the known galaxies.
