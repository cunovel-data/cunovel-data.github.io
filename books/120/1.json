{"id":3062,"no":1,"title":"Prefatory Notice to the Illustrated Edition","content":"This work was described, on its first appearance, by a writer in the Quarterly Review as “One of the most interesting narratives of voyaging that it has fallen to our lot to take up, and one which must always occupy a distinguished place in the history of scientific navigation. This prophecy has been amply verified by experience; the extraordinary minuteness and accuracy of Mr. Darwin’s observations, combined with the charm and simplicity of his descriptions, have ensured the popularity of this book with all classes of readers — and that popularity has even increased in recent years. No attempt, however, has hitherto been made to produce an illustrated edition of this valuable work: numberless places and objects are mentioned and described, but the difficulty of obtaining authentic and original representations of them drawn for the purpose has never been overcome until now. Most of the views given in this work are from sketches made on the spot by Mr. Pritchett, with Mr. Darwin’s book by his side. Some few of the others are taken from engravings which Mr. Darwin had himself selected for their interest as illustrating his voyage, and which have been kindly lent by his son. Mr. Pritchett’s name is well known in connection with the voyages of the Sunbeam and Wanderer, and it is believed that the illustrations, which have been chosen and verified with the utmost care and pains, will greatly add to the value and interest of the ”Voyage of a Naturalist.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/953/28883.html","bookId":120,"book":{"id":120,"title":"The Voyage of the Beagle 贝格尔号航行日记","description":"简介： 作为笔调轻松、文笔优美、诙谐有趣的自然历史书籍之一，《贝格尔号航行日记》记述了查尔斯 达尔文于1831年至1836年间经南美洲、加拉帕戈斯群岛、澳洲重返英格兰的旅程，此次旅行加深了他对生物学的理解，丰富和发展了他的进化论观点。在达尔文的笔下，他的那些冒险经历...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/953","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:17 AM"}}
