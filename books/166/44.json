It consisted of two officers, Messrs. Dufraisse, lieutenant of marines, and Rodamel, naval ensign, and with these were a sergeant and seven soldiers. For two days they had been engaged in reconnoitring the most favorable situation for a post at Gouina, when they became witnesses of Dr. Ferguson\u0027s arrival.\n The warm greetings and felicitations of which our travellers were the recipients may be imagined. The Frenchmen, and they alone, having had ocular proof of the accomplishment of the daring project, naturally became Dr. Ferguson\u0027s witnesses. Hence the doctor at once asked them to give their official testimony of his arrival at the cataracts of Gouina.\n \"You would have no objection to signing a certificate of the fact, would you?\" he inquired of Lieutenant Dufraisse.\n \"At your orders!\" the latter instantly replied.\n The Englishmen were escorted to a provisional post established on the bank of the river, where they found the most assiduous attention, and every thing to supply their wants. And there the following certificate was drawn up in the terms in which it appears to-day, in the archives of the Royal Geographical Society of London:\n \"We, the undersigned, do hereby declare that, on the day herein mentioned, we witnessed the arrival of Dr. Ferguson and his two companions, Richard Kennedy and Joseph Wilson, clinging to the cordage and network of a balloon, and that the said balloon fell at a distance of a few paces from us into the river, and being swept away by the current was lost in the cataracts of Gouina. In testimony whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and seals beside those of the persons hereinabove named, for the information of all whom it may concern.\n \"Done at the Cataracts of Gouina, on the 24th of May, 1862. \"(Signed), \"SAMUEL FERGUSON \"RICHARD KENNEDY, \"JOSEPH WILSON, \"DUFRAISSE, Lieutenant of Marines, \"RODAMEL, Naval Ensign, \"DUFAYS, Sergeant, \"FLIPPEAU, MAYOR, } \"PELISSIER, LOROIS, } Privates.\" RASCAGNET, GUIL- } LON, LEBEL, }\n Here ended the astonishing journey of Dr. Ferguson and his brave companions, as vouched for by undeniable testimony; and they found themselves among friends in the midst of most hospitable tribes, whose relations with the French settlements are frequent and amicable.\n They had arrived at Senegal on Saturday, the 24th of May, and on the 27th of the same month they reached the post of Medina, situated a little farther to the north, but on the river.\n There the French officers received them with open arms, and lavished upon them all the resources of their hospitality. Thus aided, the doctor and his friends were enabled to embark almost immediately on the small steamer called the Basilic, which ran down to the mouth of the river.\n Two weeks later, on the 10th of June, they arrived at Saint Louis, where the governor gave them a magnificent reception, and they recovered completely from their excitement and fatigue.\n Besides, Joe said to every one who chose to listen:\n That was a stupid trip of ours, after all, and I wouldn\u0027t advise any body who is greedy for excitement to undertake it. It gets very tiresome at the last, and if it hadn\u0027t been for the adventures on Lake Tchad and at the Senegal River, I do believe that we\u0027d have died of yawning.\"\n An English frigate was just about to sail, and the three travellers procured passage on board of her. On the 25th of June they arrived at Portsmouth, and on the next day at London.\n We will not describe the reception they got from the Royal Geographical Society, nor the intense curiosity and consideration of which they became the objects. Kennedy set off, at once, for Edinburgh, with his famous rifle, for he was in haste to relieve the anxiety of his faithful old housekeeper.\n The doctor and his devoted Joe remained the same men that we have known them, excepting that one change took place at their own suggestion.\n They ceased to be master and servant, in order to become bosom friends.\n The journals of all Europe were untiring in their praises of the bold explorers, and the Daily Telegraph struck off an edition of three hundred and seventy-seven thousand copies on the day when it published a sketch of the trip.\n Doctor Ferguson, at a public meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, gave a recital of his journey through the air, and obtained for himself and his companions the golden medal set apart to reward the most remarkable exploring expedition of the year 1862.\n ----------\n The first result of Dr. Ferguson\u0027s expedition was to establish, in the most precise manner, the facts and geographical surveys reported by Messrs. Barth, Burton, Speke, and others. Thanks to the still more recent expeditions of Messrs. Speke and Grant, De Heuglin and Muntzinger, who have been ascending to the sources of the Nile, and penetrating to the centre of Africa, we shall be enabled ere long to verify, in turn, the discoveries of Dr. Ferguson in that vast region comprised between the fourteenth and thirty-third degrees of east longitude.\n 旅行尾声——笔录证明——法国殖民地——梅迪纳哨所——“巴西利克号”火轮——圣路易——返回伦敦\n 岸边的法国人是塞内加尔总督派来的一支探险队成员。这支探险队由两名军官：海军陆战队上尉迪弗莱斯和海军中尉罗达麦尔，1名中士和7名士兵组成。两天来，他们一直忙着勘测地形，寻找有利位置，以便在圭纳瀑布一带设立一个哨所。他们无意中成了弗格森博士抵达塞内加尔河右岸的见证人。\n 很容易想象到， 3位旅行家受到了多么热烈的祝贺和多么隆重的接待。亲眼看到弗格森等3人完成这项大胆计划的法国人， 理所当然成了事实的见证人。因此，博士要求他们正式出具一份确认他和同伴到达圭纳瀑布的证明。\n “您不会拒绝在笔录证明上签字吧？”他问迪弗莱斯上尉。\n “当然啦，弗格森博士。我愿意为您效劳。”上尉答道。\n 3位英国人被接到了河边新建的临时哨所里。 他们在那儿受到了无微不至的关照，并且享用了丰盛的食物。还是在那儿，军人们用下面的措辞拟写了一份书面证明。这份证明现今存放在伦敦地理学会档案中。证明上写道：\n 兹声明，今日，我们目睹了弗格森博士及其两位同伴理查德·肯尼迪与约瑟夫·威尔逊①悬于一气球球网之下到达本地点。该气球落入距我们仅几步之遥的塞内加尔河里，被水流卷走，沉没于圭纳瀑布中。\n ①肯尼迪是理查德的简称，乔是约瑟夫的简称。\n 我们谨与上述当事人共同签署本文件，特此郑重证明以上所说事实完全属实。\n 弗格森·弗格森、理查德·肯尼迪、约瑟夫·威儿逊、海军陆战队上尉迪莱斯、海军中尉罗达麦尔、中士迪费、士兵弗利波、梅约尔、佩利西埃、洛鲁瓦、拉斯卡涅、吉庸、勒贝尔\n 1862年5月24日于圭纳瀑布\n 5个星期来， 弗格森博士和他的两位好伙伴，历经千辛万苦，终于完成了横贯非洲大陆的壮举。他们这趟非凡的旅行，在确认了无可辩驳的证据后，就此结束了。3位旅行家现在与朋友们一起身处热情好客的部落里。 这些部落与法国殖民当局的各个部落门联系频繁。\n 他们是5月24日星期六抵达塞内加尔河的。同月27日，他们沿河岸往北走一些，到了那里的梅迪纳哨所。\n 在那里，他们同样受到了法国军官们的热烈欢迎和真情友好的款待。博士和他的同伴没有怎么耽搁，当天就登上了“巴西利克号”小火轮。轮船载着他们顺塞内加尔河而下，一直驶向入海口。\n 两个星期后， 6月10日，他们到达圣路易城，受到了总督热烈而隆重的接待。在此之前，他们的身心已完全恢复了健康。乔对那些追随者一个劲地说：\n “总之，我们这趟旅行平淡得很，没什么可谈的。要是哪位一心想去寻找刺激的话，我劝他还是别费那个劲。这次旅行到最后，简直可以说既枯燥又乏味。如果没有乍得湖和塞内加尔河两次遇上点意外的事，我真觉得要给闷死了！”\n 他们到的正是时候，一艘英国战舰即将启航回国，3位旅行家恰好搭上。6月25日，他们到达朴次茅斯，第二天就回到了伦敦。我们这儿就不详述他们在皇家地理学会受到的迎接，也不详述他们受到的殷勤款待了。肯尼迪带着他那支出色的马枪，很快动身回爱丁堡去了。他要急着回去给老女管家报平安，省得她整天为他提心吊胆。\n 弗格森博士和他忠实的乔依然和我们刚认识时一样，不过他们的关系却不知不觉发生了变化。两人成了朋友。\n 全欧洲的报纸连篇累牍， 大肆赞扬了这3位大胆的探险家。“每日电讯报”刊登一篇旅行摘记的那一天，报纸印销量达967000份之多。\n 弗格森博士在皇家地理学会的大会上作了他乘气球探险的报告。他和他的两位同伴获得了1862年度杰出探险金质奖章。\n 弗格森博士此次探险旅行的伟大成就主要在于，最为详细地确认了巴尔特博士、伯顿、斯皮克和其他探险家探察过的各种情况和测定的地理位置。斯皮克和格兰特先生以及霍伊格林和门兴格尔先生目前领导的两支探险队正分别向尼罗河发源地和非洲中心进发。由于他们的努力，不久我们将能验证弗格森博士在东经14度到33度之间广大地区进行的考察发现。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/305/530.html","bookId":166,"book":{"id":166,"title":"气球上的五星期 Five Weeks in a Balloon","description":"简介： Five Weeks in a Balloon, or, Journeys and Discoveries in Africa by Three Englishmen (French: Cinq semaines en ballon) is an adventure novel by Jules Verne.
