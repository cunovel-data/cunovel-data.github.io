On the next day, May 11th, the Victoria resumed her adventurous journey. Her passengers had the same confidence in her that a good seaman has in his ship. In terrific hurricanes, in tropical heats, when making dangerous departures, and descents still more dangerous, it had, at all times and in all places, come out safely. It might almost have been said that Ferguson managed it with a wave of the hand; and hence, without knowing in advance, where the point of arrival would be, the doctor had no fears concerning the successful issue of his journey. However, in this country of barbarians and fanatics, prudence obliged him to take the strictest precautions. He therefore counselled his companions to have their eyes wide open for every thing and at all hours. The wind drifted a little more to the northward, and, toward nine o\u0027clock, they sighted the larger city of Mosfeia, built upon an eminence which was itself enclosed between two lofty mountains. Its position was impregnable, a narrow road running between a marsh and a thick wood being the only channel of approach to it. At the moment of which we write, a sheik, accompanied by a mounted escort, and clad in a garb of brilliant colors, preceded by couriers and trumpeters, who put aside the boughs of the trees as he rode up, was making his grand entry into the place. The doctor lowered the balloon in order to get a better look at this cavalcade of natives; but, as the balloon grew larger to their eyes, they began to show symptoms of intense affright, and at length made off in different directions as fast as their legs and those of their horses could carry them. The sheik alone did not budge an inch. He merely grasped his long musket, cocked it, and proudly waited in silence. The doctor came on to within a hundred and fifty feet of him, and then, with his roundest and fullest voice, saluted him courteously in the Arabic tongue. But, upon hearing these words falling, as it seemed, from the sky, the sheik dismounted and prostrated himself in the dust of the highway, where the doctor had to leave him, finding it impossible to divert him from his adoration. \"Unquestionably,\" Ferguson remarked, \"those people take us for supernatural beings. When Europeans came among them for the first time, they were mistaken for creatures of a higher race. When this sheik comes to speak of to-day\u0027s meeting, he will not fail to embellish the circumstance with all the resources of an Arab imagination. You may, therefore, judge what an account their legends will give of us some day.\" \"Not such a desirable thing, after all,\" said the Scot, \"in the point of view that affects civilization; it would be better to pass for mere men. That would give these negro races a superior idea of European power.\" \"Very good, my dear Dick; but what can we do about it? You might sit all day explaining the mechanism of a balloon to the savants of this country, and yet they would not comprehend you, but would persist in ascribing it to supernatural aid.\" \"Doctor, you spoke of the first time Europeans visited these regions. Who were the visitors?\" inquired Joe. \"My dear fellow, we are now upon the very track of Major Denham. It was at this very city of Mosfeia that he was received by the Sultan of Mandara; he had quitted the Bornou country; he accompanied the sheik in an expedition against the Fellatahs; he assisted in the attack on the city, which, with its arrows alone, bravely resisted the bullets of the Arabs, and put the sheik\u0027s troops to flight. All this was but a pretext for murders, raids, and pillage. The major was completely plundered and stripped, and had it not been for his horse, under whose stomach he clung with the skill of an Indian rider, and was borne with a headlong gallop from his barbarous pursuers, he never could have made his way back to Kouka, the capital of Bornou.\" \"Who was this Major Denham?\" \"A fearless Englishman, who, between 1822 and 1824, commanded an expedition into the Bornou country, in company with Captain Clapperton and Dr. Oudney. They set out from Tripoli in the month of March, reached Mourzouk, the capital of Fez, and, following the route which at a later period Dr. Barth was to pursue on his way back to Europe, they arrived, on the 16th of February, 1823, at Kouka, near Lake Tchad. Denham made several explorations in Bornou, in Mandara, and to the eastern shores of the lake. In the mean time, on the 15th of December, 1823, Captain Clapperton and Dr. Oudney had pushed their way through the Soudan country as far as Sackatoo, and Oudney died of fatigue and exhaustion in the town of Murmur.\" \"This part of Africa has, therefore, paid a heavy tribute of victims to the cause of science,\" said Kennedy. \"Yes, this country is fatal to travellers. We are moving directly toward the kingdom of Baghirmi, which Vogel traversed in 1856, so as to reach the Wadai country, where he disappeared. This young man, at the age of twenty-three, had been sent to cooperate with Dr. Barth. They met on the 1st of December, 1854, and thereupon commenced his explorations of the country. Toward 1856, he announced, in the last letters received from him, his intention to reconnoitre the kingdom of Wadai, which no European had yet penetrated. It appears that he got as far as Wara, the capital, where, according to some accounts, he was made prisoner, and, according to others, was put to death for having attempted to ascend a sacred mountain in the environs. But, we must not too lightly admit the death of travellers, since that does away with the necessity of going in search of them. For instance, how often was the death of Dr. Barth reported, to his own great annoyance! It is, therefore, very possible that Vogel may still be held as a prisoner by the Sultan of Wadai, in the hope of obtaining a good ransom for him. \"Baron de Neimans was about starting for the Wadai country when he died at Cairo, in 1855; and we now know that De Heuglin has set out on Vogel\u0027s track with the expedition sent from Leipsic, so that we shall soon be accurately informed as to the fate of that young and interesting explorer.\"* * Since the doctor\u0027s departure, letters written from El\u0027Obeid by Mr. Muntzinger, the newly-appointed head of the expedition, unfortunately place the death of Vogel beyond a doubt. Mosfeia had disappeared from the horizon long ere this, and the Mandara country was developing to the gaze of our aeronauts its astonishing fertility, with its forests of acacias, its locust-trees covered with red flowers, and the herbaceous plants of its fields of cotton and indigo trees. The river Shari, which eighty miles farther on rolled its impetuous waters into Lake Tchad, was quite distinctly seen. The doctor got his companions to trace its course upon the maps drawn by Dr. Barth. \"You perceive,\" said he, \"that the labors of this savant have been conducted with great precision; we are moving directly toward the Loggoum region, and perhaps toward Kernak, its capital. It was there that poor Toole died, at the age of scarcely twenty-two. He was a young Englishman, an ensign in the 80th regiment, who, a few weeks before, had joined Major Denham in Africa, and it was not long ere he there met his death. Ah! this vast country might well be called the graveyard of European travellers.\" Some boats, fifty feet long, were descending the current of the Shari. The Victoria, then one thousand feet above the soil, hardly attracted the attention of the natives; but the wind, which until then had been blowing with a certain degree of strength, was falling off. \"Is it possible that we are to be caught in another dead calm?\" sighed the doctor. \"Well, we\u0027ve no lack of water, nor the desert to fear, anyhow, master,\" said Joe. \"No; but there are races here still more to be dreaded.\" \"Why!\" said Joe, again, \"there\u0027s something like a town.\" \"That is Kernak. The last puffs of the breeze are wafting us to it, and, if we choose, we can take an exact plan of the place.\" \"Shall we not go nearer to it?\" asked Kennedy. \"Nothing easier, Dick! We are right over it. Allow me to turn the stopcock of the cylinder, and we\u0027ll not be long in descending.\" Half an hour later the balloon hung motionless about two hundred feet from the ground. \"Here we are!\" said the doctor, \"nearer to Kernak than a man would be to London, if he were perched in the cupola of St. Paul\u0027s. So we can take a survey at our ease.\" \"What is that tick-tacking sound that we hear on all sides?\" Joe looked attentively, and at length discovered that the noise they heard was produced by a number of weavers beating cloth stretched in the open air, on large trunks of trees. The capital of Loggoum could then be seen in its entire extent, like an unrolled chart. It is really a city with straight rows of houses and quite wide streets. In the midst of a large open space there was a slave-market, attended by a great crowd of customers, for the Mandara women, who have extremely small hands and feet, are in excellent request, and can be sold at lucrative rates. At the sight of the Victoria, the scene so often produced occurred again. At first there were outcries, and then followed general stupefaction; business was abandoned; work was flung aside, and all noise ceased. The aeronauts remained as they were, completely motionless, and lost not a detail of the populous city. They even went down to within sixty feet of the ground. Hereupon the Governor of Loggoum came out from his residence, displaying his green standard, and accompanied by his musicians, who blew on hoarse buffalo-horns, as though they would split their cheeks or any thing else, excepting their own lungs. The crowd at once gathered around him. In the mean while Dr. Ferguson tried to make himself heard, but in vain. This population looked like proud and intelligent people, with their high foreheads, their almost aquiline noses, and their curling hair; but the presence of the Victoria troubled them greatly. Horsemen could be seen galloping in all directions, and it soon became evident that the governor\u0027s troops were assembling to oppose so extraordinary a foe. Joe wore himself out waving handkerchiefs of every color and shape to them; but his exertions were all to no purpose. However, the sheik, surrounded by his court, proclaimed silence, and pronounced a discourse, of which the doctor could not understand a word. It was Arabic, mixed with Baghirmi. He could make out enough, however, by the universal language of gestures, to be aware that he was receiving a very polite invitation to depart. Indeed, he would have asked for nothing better, but for lack of wind, the thing had become impossible. His noncompliance, therefore, exasperated the governor, whose courtiers and attendants set up a furious howl to enforce immediate obedience on the part of the aerial monster. They were odd-looking fellows those courtiers, with their five or six shirts swathed around their bodies! They had enormous stomachs, some of which actually seemed to be artificial. The doctor surprised his companions by informing them that this was the way to pay court to the sultan. The rotundity of the stomach indicated the ambition of its possessor. These corpulent gentry gesticulated and bawled at the top of their voices--one of them particularly distinguishing himself above the rest--to such an extent, indeed, that he must have been a prime minister--at least, if the disturbance he made was any criterion of his rank. The common rabble of dusky denizens united their howlings with the uproar of the court, repeating their gesticulations like so many monkeys, and thereby producing a single and instantaneous movement of ten thousand arms at one time. To these means of intimidation, which were presently deemed insufficient, were added others still more formidable. Soldiers, armed with bows and arrows, were drawn up in line of battle; but by this time the balloon was expanding, and rising quietly beyond their reach. Upon this the governor seized a musket and aimed it at the balloon; but, Kennedy, who was watching him, shattered the uplifted weapon in the sheik\u0027s grasp. At this unexpected blow there was a general rout. Every mother\u0027s son of them scampered for his dwelling with the utmost celerity, and stayed there, so that the streets of the town were absolutely deserted for the remainder of that day. Night came, and not a breath of wind was stirring. The aeronauts had to make up their minds to remain motionless at the distance of but three hundred feet above the ground. Not a fire or light shone in the deep gloom, and around reigned the silence of death; but the doctor only redoubled his vigilance, as this apparent quiet might conceal some snare. And he had reason to be watchful. About midnight, the whole city seemed to be in a blaze. Hundreds of streaks of flame crossed each other, and shot to and fro in the air like rockets, forming a regular network of fire. \"That\u0027s really curious!\" said the doctor, somewhat puzzled to make out what it meant. \"By all that\u0027s glorious!\" shouted Kennedy, \"it looks as if the fire were ascending and coming up toward us!\" And, sure enough, with an accompaniment of musket-shots, yelling, and din of every description, the mass of fire was, indeed, mounting toward the Victoria. Joe got ready to throw out ballast, and Ferguson was not long at guessing the truth. Thousands of pigeons, their tails garnished with combustibles, had been set loose and driven toward the Victoria; and now, in their terror, they were flying high up, zigzagging the atmosphere with lines of fire. Kennedy was preparing to discharge all his batteries into the middle of the ascending multitude, but what could he have done against such a numberless army? The pigeons were already whisking around the car; they were even surrounding the balloon, the sides of which, reflecting their illumination, looked as though enveloped with a network of fire. The doctor dared hesitate no longer; and, throwing out a fragment of quartz, he kept himself beyond the reach of these dangerous assailants; and, for two hours afterward, he could see them wandering hither and thither through the darkness of the night, until, little by little, their light diminished, and they, one by one, died out. \"Now we may sleep in quiet,\" said the doctor. \"Not badly got up for barbarians,\" mused friend Joe, speaking his thoughts aloud. \"Oh, they employ these pigeons frequently, to set fire to the thatch of hostile villages; but this time the village mounted higher than they could go.\" \"Why, positively, a balloon need fear no enemies!\" \"Yes, indeed, it may!\" objected Ferguson. \"What are they, then, doctor?\" \"They are the careless people in the car! So, my friends, let us have vigilance in all places and at all times.\" 莫斯菲亚城——阿拉伯酋长——丹纳姆、克拉珀顿、奥德内——弗格尔——洛古姆的首都——图尔——凯纳克城上空没风了——统治者和大臣们——攻击——火鸽 第二天是5月11号， “维多利亚号”继续它的冒险旅程。现在，旅行家们已经像水手信任航船一样信赖自己的气球了。他们十分清楚，他们的“维多利亚号”经历了多少次严峻考验，度过了多少个艰难险关。无论是可怕的飓风，赤道的炎热，还是危险的起飞和险上加险的降落， 更不用说在什么时间， 什么地点了，哪一回“维多利亚号”不都是化险为夷，应付得当。再者，可以说，弗格森驾驭气球的技术已达到炉火纯青的境地，因此，虽然博士还不知道旅行的终点在哪儿，他已不再担心以后的结局了。只是，穿行于这个野蛮愚昧而充满迷信的地区，弗格森不能不多加小心，采取最严格的预防措施。他告诫同伴们要随时随地睁大眼睛，注意一切可能发生的事。 风吹着气球往更加偏北一些的方向飞去。将近9点时，3位旅行家隐约望见前方有座大城市，那就是莫斯菲亚城。它建在两座大山之间的一块高地上，难攻易守，位置非常有利。一条狭窄的道路夹在沼泽地和树林之间，这是通往该城的唯一要道。 就在3位旅行家查看该城时， 一位阿拉伯酋长正由一队服装艳丽，骑着马的卫兵护卫着进城。队伍前走着一些号手，还有几个人跑前跑后，负责清理路边树枝，以免酋长路过时衣服被挂住。 为了更近些观察这些土著人，博士降低了气球的高度。但是，随着“维多利亚号”的降低，这些土著人仿佛觉得气球越来越大，内心的恐惧也越来越严重，最后，他们终于坚持不住，有的撒开腿，有的抽打着马，一溜烟地逃跑了。只有酋长一人留在原地没有动。他抓起他的长筒火枪，装上子弹，高傲地等待着。 博士在距离地面不到150尺的空中停了下来， 然后，亮开他那美妙的嗓子，用阿拉伯语向酋长打招呼。没想到，一听到空中传下的这些话，酋长立刻跳下马匍伏在满是灰尘的路上。博士用尽办法也没能使他改变崇拜的姿态。 “既然欧洲人初到这些人中间时，就被他们认作是超人，我们也就不可能不被视为神灵了。”弗格森博士说，“以后，这位酋长谈起他的这次遭遇时，肯定会用尽一个阿拉伯人的想象才能把事情吹得神乎其神。你们因此可以设想，将来有一天传说故事中我们会是怎么样的了。” “那或许不太好。”猎人回答，“从文明的角度来说，最好还是把我们当作普通的凡人。那样的话，这些黑人或许就会承认欧洲文明了。” “完全同意，亲爱的肯尼迪。可是我们又能干些什么呢？譬如，你花老半天给这个地区的学者们讲气球的机械构造，可是他们却不知道你在说些什么，而且始终认为那是神仙的玩意儿。” “先生，”乔问，“您刚才讲到最早来这儿考察过的欧洲人。您能告诉我，他们是谁吗？” “亲爱的小伙子，当然可以了。”弗格森应允说，“要知道，我们现在正好在丹纳姆少校走过的路线上。就是在莫斯菲亚城，他受到了曼达拉的苏丹的款待。他曾离开博尔努，陪同阿拉伯酋长去远征费拉塔赫人，并参加了攻城战。该城人用弓箭英勇地抵抗住了阿拉伯人的子弹，最终击败了酋长的军队，把他们打得落花流水。其实，这一切不过是烧杀抢掠的借口而已。少校也被洗劫一空，全身衣服剥得精光，要不是藏在一匹马肚子下面，由马带着拼命地奔跑躲开了胜利者，他就再也回不到博尔努的首府库卡了。” “那么，这位丹纳姆少校是什么人呢？” “是位勇敢的英国人。1822年到1824年间，他在克拉珀顿上尉和奥德内博士的协助下，领导一支在博尔努的探险队。他们三月份从的黎波里启程，最后抵达费赞的首都穆尔祖克。 沿着后来巴尔特博士回欧洲时走的路线，他们于1823年2月16日到达乍得湖附近的库卡。丹纳姆在博尔努、曼达拉和乍得湖的东岸地区进行了各种考察。在此期间，克拉珀顿上尉和奥德内博士于1823年12月15日深入苏丹国境内，一直走到了萨卡图，这时，奥德内博士因劳累过度，精力衰竭在米尔米尔城病故。” “原来，在非洲的这一带地区，已经有不少学者为科学献身啦？”肯尼迪问。 “是的，这个地方可真是个死亡区啊！现在，我们正一直向巴尔吉米王国进发。弗格尔1856年去瓦代王国时到过那儿，后来他在瓦代王国失踪了。这位年青人才23岁， 是被派去协助巴尔特博士工作的。他们两人在1854年12月1日会了面，之后，弗格尔开始了地区考察活动。1856年前后，他在最后一批信中谈到他打算去探查清楚瓦代王国。那个地方还从来没有一位欧洲人去过呢。好像他一直到了瓦代的首都瓦拉。在哪儿，因为试图攀登城附近的圣山，有人说他被当地人抓了起来，也有人说他被处死了。不过，不要轻率地接受某位旅行家死亡的说法，因为，这样就等于说不必去寻找他们了。有多少次非正式地流传说巴尔特博士死了。这些传闻常常弄得他非常恼火，这可以理解。因此，弗格尔现在很有可能被瓦代的苏丹关押着。这位苏丹正希望人去赎他的囚犯呢。尼曼斯男爵来瓦代的途中，于1855年死在了开罗。我们现在知道，德·霍伊格林先生与由莱比锡派出的一支探险队一起已经开始了寻找弗格尔的工作，因此，我们也许即将弄清这位牵动着众多人心的年轻旅行家的命运如何了①。” ①在博士启程后，由探险队新任队长门辛格尔从欧拜伊德发出的信中证实，弗格尔已死亡。 莫斯菲亚城早已在地平线上消失，现在，三位旅行家眼前渐渐变大了的是曼达拉城。这个地方异常富饶，到处是刺槐林，开红花的洋槐林；棉花地和槐蓝田里的作物长势喜人；沙里河水势汹涌，奔腾不息；河水在80英里以外汇入乍得湖。 博士提醒同伴们注意巴尔特地图册上标明的这条河，说： “你们看，这位学者的工作做得何等细致。我们现在正笔直地驶向洛古姆地区，甚至有可能驶向它的首府凯尔纳克。可怜的图尔就是死在那儿，他当时几乎不到22岁。这位年青的英国人是第80团的掌旗官。他来非洲参加丹纳姆的工作才几个星期，就那么不凑巧碰上了死神。唉！这块辽阔的土地真可以称得上是欧洲人的墓地！” 这时，几艘长50尺的小船正顺着沙里河而下。由于“维多利亚号”是在距地面1000尺高的上空飞行，所以，它没怎么引当地人的注意，但本来一直不算小的风力却开始减弱了。 “难道我们又要碰到停风了？”博士担心地说。 “停就让它停吧，主人，反正我们不用再怕没水喝，也不同担心沙漠了。” “不对，乔，还有更可怕的当地人呢。” “瞧，”乔说，“那儿像一座城。” “是凯尔纳克城。虽说风越来越小，可一直在把我们往那儿送。如果方便的话，我们可以绘一幅精确的城市平面图。” “我们不靠近点吗？”肯尼迪问。 “这还不容易，肯尼迪，现在，我们就在城的正上方。让我稍稍转动一下氢氧喷嘴的开关，喏，我们开始下降了。” 半小时后，“维多利亚号”在距地面200尺的空中停下，不动了。 “现在，我们离凯尔纳克已经很近，比一个人站在圣·保罗大教堂球状屋顶上看伦敦还要近，因此，我们可以尽情地欣赏这座城。” “咦？怎么回事？从四面八方传来一种好像用木槌敲东西的声音。” 乔仔细地张望，很快就发现，这种声音是许多织布工人在露天敲打他们绷在大树干上的布时发出的。 洛古姆的首府现在像一幅展开的画卷一览无余。 它的整个外貌被3位旅行家尽收眼底。这是个真正的城市：房屋一排排整齐有序，街道相当宽阔；大广场里面有一个奴隶交易市场，那里聚集着许多买主，一看就知道他们是干这一行的。在这里，手足纤小的芒达拉女子极受欢迎，更能卖上好价。 一看到“维多利亚号”，多次发生过的场面又一次出现了：首先土人们发出喊叫声，随后个个惊慌失措，生意也顾不上做了，活计也不敢干了，大家掉头就逃；转眼间， 广场上空荡荡的，一个人影也不见了，什么声音也没有了。3位旅行家在吊篮里一动不动，仔仔细细地端详着这个人口稠密的城市，惟恐漏掉了什么，为此，他们甚至把气球降到离地面仅60尺的高度。 这时，洛古姆的统治者打着他的绿旗从宅邸走了出来；乐师们使劲吹着做工粗糙的牛皮号角跟在他后面。号声断断续续，上气不接下气，大概是号手们喘息太急促的缘故。土人渐渐聚集到了他们的君王周围。弗格森博士想让他听明白自己的意思，但是最终也没能如愿。 这儿的居民额头高高的，头发卷曲，有点鹰勾鼻，显得既骄傲又聪明。但是，“维多利亚号”的出现大大扰乱了他们的正常生活；只见一些骑马的人往各个方向飞驰而去，事情很快就明朗了：君王的军队迅速集合到了广场，准备与一个那么非同寻常的敌人交战。乔挥动着一块又一块各种颜色的手帕，然而全是白费劲儿，什么结果也没有。 就在这时，被大臣们簇拥着的君王要求子民肃静，然后，他叽哩咕噜地讲了一通。他的话博士一点没听懂，这是一种掺杂了巴尔吉米语的阿拉伯话。他只是根据君王打的手势（这种世界性的语言），弄明白了是请他离去。博士也巴不得离开这儿，可是眼下一点风没有，根本不可能走开。见气球仍然不动，君王被激怒了。于是，他的大臣们齐声呐喊起来，想以此逼迫这个怪物逃掉。 这些大臣都是些模样古里古怪的人。他们个个身穿五、六件花里胡哨的衣衫，人人挺着个大肚子，不过，有几个人的肚子很像是假的。博士告诉同伴们，这是他们讨好苏丹的方式，猎人和乔听后无不称奇。在当地，一个人大腹便便被看作是有雄心大志。这些肥头大耳的家伙在那儿指手画脚，又喊又叫，其中一位表现得尤为突出。如果嗓门越响亮，官职越高的话，他可能是宰相一类的人物。大群黑人也随着朝臣们一起吼叫，并且像猴子一样模仿着他们的手势，指指划划。上万条胳膊同时做着同一个动作，让人看了觉得很滑稽。 见这些恐吓方式不起作用，他们便开始采取更加令人可畏的举动；战士手持弓箭，排成了战斗队形。但是，“维多利亚号”已经膨胀起来，并缓缓地升到了利箭的射程之外。这时，手持火枪的君主把枪对准气球。肯尼迪一直在监视他的一举一动，见状忙扣动马枪板机。只听一声枪响，酋长手中的火枪应声而断。 这突如其来的一枪，使得全场顿时乱作一团。土人们个个像受惊的兔子，撒开腿飞快地跑回了自己的草屋。直到天黑，整个城市显得空荡荡的，大街小巷见不到一个人影。 夜幕降临了。 风早已平息。博士只好把气球停在距地面300尺高的空中。整个城市灯火全无，一片黑暗，笼罩着死一般的寂静。弗格森博士提高了警惕。他十分清楚，这种宁静的背后很可能隐藏着陷阱。 博士的谨慎不无道理。午夜左右，整个城市像着了火似的，成百上千条火光如同腾升的焰火，左右穿插，上下飞舞，在空中搅成了一个火团。 “真有点怪！”博士有些迷惑。 “哎呀，我的上帝！”肯尼迪忽然嚷起来，“这些火好像在往上来，而且离我们越来越近了。” 果然，在胆怯的呐喊声和砰砰的枪声中，这片火光逐渐升高，奔着“维多利亚号”而来。乔见状，立即准备好扔压载物。弗格森顿时明白了眼前发生的一切。 原来，是成千上万只尾巴上拴着易燃物的鸽子。它们被土人放出后，冲着“维多利亚号”扑过来。惊恐不安的鸽子慌慌张张地飞着，在空中划出无数道弯弯曲曲的火线。肯尼迪立即拿出所有的枪向这片火鸽射击。可是，对手数也数不清，他又怎能打得光呢？鸽子已经围住了吊篮和气球。在这片火光的映照下，“维多利亚号”好像被罩在了一张火网中。 博士此时毫不犹豫，伸手扔出一块石英石头。“维多利亚号”立刻上升。直至这些火鸽达不到的高度，博士才把气球停下来。两个小时后，黑夜里到处飞舞的火鸽总算开始减少，最后，火光完全熄灭了。 “现在，我们可以放心大胆地睡觉了。”博士松了口气。 “这些野人想的办法还真不错！”乔回味说。 “是的，他们往往放出这种带火的鸽子去烧其他村子的茅屋。但是这一次，他们要烧的房子却比他们那带翅膀的纵火部队飞得还要高！” “事情明摆着嘛，气球没什么要怕的人。”肯尼迪说。 “这话可就不对了。”博士反驳道。 “噢？你说怕什么？”肯尼迪问。 “怕那些在吊篮里不谨慎的人，所以，朋友们，随时随地都要多加小心。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/305/516.html","bookId":166,"book":{"id":166,"title":"气球上的五星期
