On the 27th of May, at nine o\u0027clock in the morning, the country presented an entirely different aspect. The slopes, extending far away, changed to hills that gave evidence of mountains soon to follow. They would have to cross the chain which separates the basin of the Niger from the basin of the Senegal, and determines the course of the water-shed, whether to the Gulf of Guinea on the one hand, or to the bay of Cape Verde on the other. As far as Senegal, this part of Africa is marked down as dangerous. Dr. Ferguson knew it through the recitals of his predecessors. They had suffered a thousand privations and been exposed to a thousand dangers in the midst of these barbarous negro tribes. It was this fatal climate that had devoured most of the companions of Mungo Park. Ferguson, therefore, was more than ever decided not to set foot in this inhospitable region. But he had not enjoyed one moment of repose. The Victoria was descending very perceptibly, so much so that he had to throw overboard a number more of useless articles, especially when there was a mountain-top to pass. Things went on thus for more than one hundred and twenty miles; they were worn out with ascending and falling again; the balloon, like another rock of Sisyphus, kept continually sinking back toward the ground. The rotundity of the covering, which was now but little inflated, was collapsing already. It assumed an elongated shape, and the wind hollowed large cavities in the silken surface. Kennedy could not help observing this. \"Is there a crack or a tear in the balloon?\" he asked. \"No, but the gutta percha has evidently softened or melted in the heat, and the hydrogen is escaping through the silk.\" \"How can we prevent that?\" \"It is impossible. Let us lighten her. That is the only help. So let us throw out every thing we can spare.\" \"But what shall it be?\" said the hunter, looking at the car, which was already quite bare. \"Well, let us get rid of the awning, for its weight is quite considerable.\" Joe, who was interested in this order, climbed up on the circle which kept together the cordage of the network, and from that place easily managed to detach the heavy curtains of the awning and throw them overboard. \"There\u0027s something that will gladden the hearts of a whole tribe of blacks,\" said he; \"there\u0027s enough to dress a thousand of them, for they\u0027re not very extravagant with cloth.\" The balloon had risen a little, but it soon became evident that it was again approaching the ground. \"Let us alight,\" suggested Kennedy, \"and see what can be done with the covering of the balloon.\" \"I tell you, again, Dick, that we have no means of repairing it.\" \"Then what shall we do?\" \"We\u0027ll have to sacrifice every thing not absolutely indispensable; I am anxious, at all hazards, to avoid a detention in these regions. The forests over the tops of which we are skimming are any thing but safe.\" \"What! are there lions in them, or hyenas?\" asked Joe, with an expression of sovereign contempt. \"Worse than that, my boy! There are men, and some of the most cruel, too, in all Africa.\" \"How is that known?\" \"By the statements of travellers who have been here before us. Then the French settlers, who occupy the colony of Senegal, necessarily have relations with the surrounding tribes. Under the administration of Colonel Faidherbe, reconnoissances have been pushed far up into the country. Officers such as Messrs. Pascal, Vincent, and Lambert, have brought back precious documents from their expeditions. They have explored these countries formed by the elbow of the Senegal in places where war and pillage have left nothing but ruins.\" \"What, then, took place?\" \"I will tell you. In 1854 a Marabout of the Senegalese Fouta, Al-Hadji by name, declaring himself to be inspired like Mohammed, stirred up all the tribes to war against the infidels--that is to say, against the Europeans. He carried destruction and desolation over the regions between the Senegal River and its tributary, the Fateme. Three hordes of fanatics led on by him scoured the country, sparing neither a village nor a hut in their pillaging, massacring career. He advanced in person on the town of Sego, which was a long time threatened. In 1857 he worked up farther to the northward, and invested the fortification of Medina, built by the French on the bank of the river. This stronghold was defended by Paul Holl, who, for several months, without provisions or ammunition, held out until Colonel Faidherbe came to his relief. Al-Hadji and his bands then repassed the Senegal, and reappeared in the Kaarta, continuing their rapine and murder.--Well, here below us is the very country in which he has found refuge with his hordes of banditti; and I assure you that it would not be a good thing to fall into his hands.\" \"We shall not,\" said Joe, \"even if we have to throw overboard our clothes to save the Victoria.\" \"We are not far from the river,\" said the doctor, \"but I foresee that our balloon will not be able to carry us beyond it.\" \"Let us reach its banks, at all events,\" said the Scot, \"and that will be so much gained.\" \"That is what we are trying to do,\" rejoined Ferguson, \"only that one thing makes me feel anxious.\" \"What is that?\" \"We shall have mountains to pass, and that will be difficult to do, since I cannot augment the ascensional force of the balloon, even with the greatest possible heat that I can produce.\" \"Well, wait a bit,\" said Kennedy, \"and we shall see!\" \"The poor Victoria!\" sighed Joe; \"I had got fond of her as the sailor does of his ship, and I\u0027ll not give her up so easily. She may not be what she was at the start-- granted; but we shouldn\u0027t say a word against her. She has done us good service, and it would break my heart to desert her.\" \"Be at your ease, Joe; if we leave her, it will be in spite of ourselves. She\u0027ll serve us until she\u0027s completely worn out, and I ask of her only twenty-four hours more!\" \"Ah, she\u0027s getting used up! She grows thinner and thinner,\" said Joe, dolefully, while he eyed her. \"Poor balloon!\" \"Unless I am deceived,\" said Kennedy, \"there on the horizon are the mountains of which you were speaking, doctor.\" \"Yes, there they are, indeed!\" exclaimed the doctor, after having examined them through his spy-glass, \"and they look very high. We shall have some trouble in crossing them.\" \"Can we not avoid them?\" \"I am afraid not, Dick. See what an immense space they occupy--nearly one-half of the horizon!\" \"They even seem to shut us in,\" added Joe. \"They are gaining on both our right and our left.\" \"We must then pass over them.\" These obstacles, which threatened such imminent peril, seemed to approach with extreme rapidity, or, to speak more accurately, the wind, which was very fresh, was hurrying the balloon toward the sharp peaks. So rise it must, or be dashed to pieces. \"Let us empty our tank of water,\" said the doctor, \"and keep only enough for one day.\" \"There it goes,\" shouted Joe. \"Does the balloon rise at all?\" asked Kennedy. \"A little--some fifty feet,\" replied the doctor, who kept his eyes fixed on the barometer. \"But that is not enough.\" In truth the lofty peaks were starting up so swiftly before the travellers that they seemed to be rushing down upon them. The balloon was far from rising above them. She lacked an elevation of more than five hundred feet more. The stock of water for the cylinder was also thrown overboard and only a few pints were retained, but still all this was not enough. \"We must pass them though!\" urged the doctor. \"Let us throw out the tanks--we have emptied them.\" said Kennedy. \"Over with them!\" \"There they go!\" panted Joe. \"But it\u0027s hard to see ourselves dropping off this way by piecemeal.\" \"Now, for your part, Joe, make no attempt to sacrifice yourself as you did the other day! Whatever happens, swear to me that you will not leave us!\" \"Have no fears, my master, we shall not be separated.\" The Victoria had ascended some hundred and twenty feet, but the crest of the mountain still towered above it. It was an almost perpendicular ridge that ended in a regular wall rising abruptly in a straight line. It still rose more than two hundred feet over the aeronauts. \"In ten minutes,\" said the doctor to himself, \"our car will be dashed against those rocks unless we succeed in passing them!\" \"Well, doctor?\" queried Joe. \"Keep nothing but our pemmican, and throw out all the heavy meat.\" Thereupon the balloon was again lightened by some fifty pounds, and it rose very perceptibly, but that was of little consequence, unless it got above the line of the mountain-tops. The situation was terrifying. The Victoria was rushing on with great rapidity. They could feel that she would be dashed to pieces--that the shock would be fearful. The doctor glanced around him in the car. It was nearly empty. \"If needs be, Dick, hold yourself in readiness to throw over your fire-arms!\" \"Sacrifice my fire-arms?\" repeated the sportsman, with intense feeling. \"My friend, I ask it; it will be absolutely necessary!\" \"Samuel! Doctor!\" \"Your guns, and your stock of powder and ball might cost us our lives.\" \"We are close to it!\" cried Joe. Sixty feet! The mountain still overtopped the balloon by sixty feet. Joe took the blankets and other coverings and tossed them out; then, without a word to Kennedy, he threw over several bags of bullets and lead. The balloon went up still higher; it surmounted the dangerous ridge, and the rays of the sun shone upon its uppermost extremity; but the car was still below the level of certain broken masses of rock, against which it would inevitably be dashed. \"Kennedy! Kennedy! throw out your fire-arms, or we are lost!\" shouted the doctor. \"Wait, sir; wait one moment!\" they heard Joe exclaim, and, looking around, they saw Joe disappear over the edge of the balloon. \"Joe! Joe!\" cried Kennedy. \"Wretched man!\" was the doctor\u0027s agonized expression. The flat top of the mountain may have had about twenty feet in breadth at this point, and, on the other side, the slope presented a less declivity. The car just touched the level of this plane, which happened to be quite even, and it glided over a soil composed of sharp pebbles that grated as it passed. \"We\u0027re over it! we\u0027re over it! we\u0027re clear!\" cried out an exulting voice that made Ferguson\u0027s heart leap to his throat. The daring fellow was there, grasping the lower rim of the car, and running afoot over the top of the mountain, thus lightening the balloon of his whole weight. He had to hold on with all his strength, too, for it was likely to escape his grasp at any moment. When he had reached the opposite declivity, and the abyss was before him, Joe, by a vigorous effort, hoisted himself from the ground, and, clambering up by the cordage, rejoined his friends. \"That was all!\" he coolly ejaculated. \"My brave Joe! my friend!\" said the doctor, with deep emotion. \"Oh! what I did,\" laughed the other, \"was not for you; it was to save Mr. Kennedy\u0027s rifle. I owed him that good turn for the affair with the Arab! I like to pay my debts, and now we are even,\" added he, handing to the sportsman his favorite weapon. \"I\u0027d feel very badly to see you deprived of it.\" Kennedy heartily shook the brave fellow\u0027s hand, without being able to utter a word. The Victoria had nothing to do now but to descend. That was easy enough, so that she was soon at a height of only two hundred feet from the ground, and was then in equilibrium. The surface seemed very much broken as though by a convulsion of nature. It presented numerous inequalities, which would have been very difficult to avoid during the night with a balloon that could no longer be controlled. Evening was coming on rapidly, and, notwithstanding his repugnance, the doctor had to make up his mind to halt until morning. \"We\u0027ll now look for a favorable stopping-place,\" said he. \"Ah!\" replied Kennedy, \"you have made up your mind, then, at last?\" \"Yes, I have for a long time been thinking over a plan which we\u0027ll try to put into execution; it is only six o\u0027clock in the evening, and we shall have time enough. Throw out your anchors, Joe!\" Joe immediately obeyed, and the two anchors dangled below the balloon. \"I see large forests ahead of us,\" said the doctor; \"we are going to sweep along their tops, and we shall grapple to some tree, for nothing would make me think of passing the night below, on the ground.\" \"But can we not descend?\" asked Kennedy. \"To what purpose? I repeat that it would be dangerous for us to separate, and, besides, I claim your help for a difficult piece of work.\" The Victoria, which was skimming along the tops of immense forests, soon came to a sharp halt. Her anchors had caught, and, the wind falling as dusk came on, she remained motionlessly suspended above a vast field of verdure, formed by the tops of a forest of sycamores. 临近塞内加尔——“维多利亚号”越来越低了——尽可能扔空吊篮——伊斯兰教圣人埃尔—哈吉①——帕斯卡尔、万桑、朗贝尔——穆罕默德的竞争者——不易飞越的高山——肯尼迪的武器——乔别出心裁——在树林上空歇息 ①哈吉是对曾朝觐圣地麦加的伊斯兰教徒的一种荣誉称号。 5月27日早上9点左右，大地呈现出一幅崭新的面貌。缓缓倾斜的地面变成了丘陵。 这预示着随后将有高山。2位旅行家只有飞越过横在尼日尔河流域和塞内加尔河流域之间的这条山脉。它使得两边的水分别流入几内亚湾和佛得角湾。 非洲的这部分一直到塞内加尔，都被认为是危险地区。弗格森博士早已从以前的探险家们口中得知这一点。那些探险家们在这块土地上曾因受到野蛮的黑人无数次的洗劫而困苦不堪，也曾碰到过无数次的危险而九死一生。这里的恶劣气候使蒙戈—帕克的大部分同伴丢了性命，因此，弗格森更加认定决不能在这块充满敌意的土地上降落。 但是，他已经没有功夫休息了。“维多利亚号”明显地越飞越低，他不得不吩咐再扔掉许多不是十分有用的东西，尤其是在飞越一座山峰的时候。就这样，气球又前进了120多英里。 升起来降下去，忽升忽降，大家都被折腾得疲惫不堪。气球如同西绪福斯推的巨石②，好不容易升起来，很快又降下去。几乎失去膨胀力的球囊，形状已大大改变，越拉越长了。风吹在松松的外壳上弄出了许多大皱褶。 ②希腊神化传说中，西绪福斯生前是个暴君，死后被罚在地狱里把巨石推到山顶。但每次快到山顶时，巨石又滚落下来，如此循环不止。 发现这种情况，肯尼迪不由得担心起来。他问： “气球会不会有裂缝呢？” “那倒没有。”博士答道，“可是温度高，天气热，橡胶显然已经老化或溶化。所以氢气从塔夫绸布缝里漏跑了。” “怎么才能不让它漏气呢？” “眼下做不到。我们只有尽可能拖延下去。这是唯一的方法了。现在能扔的都扔了吧。” “哪里还有什么可扔的了？”猎人望望几乎已经空了的吊篮说。 “把帐篷拆下扔掉吧。光是它就重得很。” 乔听到吩咐，立即爬到系着网索的圆环上方。他在那儿毫不费力地取下厚重的帐篷帘布，扔出了吊篮。 “这个帐篷肯定能让整整一个部落的黑人得到好处。”乔调侃道，“它够给上千名土人做穿的，因为他们用布少的不能再少了。” 气球稍稍上升了一点儿，但是很快又明显地向地面靠近。 “咱们降下去吧，”肯尼迪建议，“看看能不能为球囊做点什么。” “肯尼迪，我再给你说一遍，我们没有任何办法修补它。” “那我们该怎么办呢？” “把不是非用不可的东西全都舍出去吧。无论如何，我也要避免在这附近着陆。我们眼下飞过的这片树林可是一点儿也不安全。” “什么？有狮子，还是有鬣狗？”乔一脸蔑视地说。 “小伙子，比这些更可怕。这里有人，而且恐怕是非洲最残酷的人。” “您怎么知道是呢？” “从在我们之前来过这里的旅行家们那儿听说的，还有从法国人那里知道的。住在塞内加尔殖民地的法国人不可避免地要与周围的部落打交道。在费德尔布①上校统治时期，对这一地区的考察工作已经很引人注意了。一些军官，如帕斯卡尔、万桑、朗贝尔，曾经从他们的探险中带回一些详尽的材料。他们考察了塞内加尔河湾地区，由于战争和洗劫，那儿只留下一片废墟。” ①1818—1889，法国将军，1854年任塞内加尔总督。 “到底发生了什么事？” “是这样：1854年，塞内加尔富塔城的一位伊斯兰教圣人阿尔—哈吉，自称和穆罕默德一样受到了神的启示。他鼓动所有的部落对不信伊斯兰教的人，也就是对欧洲人，发动一场战争。这场动乱使得塞内加尔河与支流法莱梅河之间遭到了蹂躏和破坏。由他率领的3股宗教狂队伍一路上杀人抢掠，挨村挨户地扫荡了这个地区。他们甚至入侵尼日尔河谷地，一直到了塞古城下，使这座城长期受到威胁。1857年，阿尔—哈吉带人北上围攻法国人在塞内加尔河畔修建的梅迪纳要塞。这座堡垒在一位英雄人物保尔·奥尔的指挥下进行了顽强的保卫战。他们在缺粮少弹的情况下，苦苦守了好几个月，一直坚持到费德尔布上校率援兵来赶走这些宗教狂。于是，阿尔—哈吉带领他的信徒们重新渡过塞内加尔河，又来到卡尔塔城继续杀人抢掠。这块地区就是他和他的那帮强盗躲藏、隐蔽的地方。我肯定地告诉你们，落在这伙人手里，决不会有好事的。” “我们别落到他们手里了。”乔说，“能舍的都舍掉吧，哪怕把东西扔光，连脚上的鞋子都不剩，我们也要把‘维多利亚号’再升上去。” “我们离塞内加尔河不远了。”博士宣布，“不过，我预计可能气球把我们带不过河去。” “总可以把我们带到河边吧。”猎人说，“能到那儿，就行啦。” “这正是我们力争做到的。”博士答道，“只是，有一件事让我担心。” “哪件事？” “我们还要越过几座大山才行。可是这很不容易，因为我无法再使气球的升力增大，即使烧得最热也不行。” “我们等着吧，到时候再说。”肯尼迪安慰博士说。 “可怜的‘维多利亚号’！”乔感慨万分，“就像船员恋船一样，我对它已经很有感情了。和它分手，我还真舍不得！与当初我们动身旅行时相比，它等于说变了个模样。不过尽管如此，也不该对它说三道四呀！它毕竟忠实地为我们服务过。要我抛弃它实在于心不忍。” “放心吧，乔。即使有一天我们忍痛割爱，那也是迫不得已。我们的‘维多利亚号’将一直为我们耗尽最后一点力。现在，我还需要它再飞上24个小时。” “它在衰竭。”乔打量着气球说，“它瘦了，它的生命就要到头了。可怜的气球啊！” “弗格森，如果我没弄错的话，地平线那儿就是你说的那些大山了。” “正是的，”博士举起望远镜查看后，证实道，“看来这些山很高，恐怕我们很难飞过去。” “就不能避开吗？” “肯尼迪，我认为不能。你瞧它们占了多大一片，差不多是地平线的一半了！” “它们就像把我们围住了似的。”乔说，“左边、右边全让山给占住了。” “我们只有从上面飞过去。” 这些障碍物那么威严，似乎在飞快地靠过来。说得准确些，大风拼命地刮着，猛推‘维多利亚号’向锐利的山尖扑去。必须不惜一切代价把气球升高，否则就要撞上去了。 “把水箱的水倒空，”弗格森吩咐，“只留够一天用的就行。” “好的！”乔应道。 “气球升了吗？”肯尼迪问。 “一点点儿，50尺左右。”博士答道，眼睛紧紧盯着气压表。“不过，还不够。” 的确， 高高的山峰好像正迎面扑向3人。他们还远没有升到山峰上面。气球还要上升500多尺才行。 氢氧喷嘴的供应水也倒掉了，只留下了几品脱。但是这仍然不够。 “还是得想法子过去啊。”博士说。 “既然水倒掉了，水箱有什么用，干脆扔了吧？”肯尼迪征求道。 “扔吧！” “好哩！”乔答应道，“东西一样样地都扔了，心里真不是个滋味。” “至于你，乔，千万别像上次那样再作自我牺牲了。不管发生什么事，你向我发誓不离开我们。” “放心吧，主人，我们永远不离开。” “维多利亚号”又往上升了20托瓦兹左右，但是大山仍然高出许多。这条山梁笔直，如同刀削斧砍般陡峭，形成一堵名副其实的高墙，拦在了气球的面前。它比“维多利亚号”仍然高出200多尺。 “如果我们上升的高度超不过它，再过十分钟，吊篮就会撞在岩石上粉碎！”博士暗暗说。 “弗格森先生，怎么办？”乔问。 “只把肉饼留下，其余的肉全扔掉吧！” 气球又减少了350斤左右的负荷， 明显升高了些。但是问题仍没有彻底解决，气球的高度还是达不到。情况非常危急，“维多利亚号”正以很快的速度向前移动，让人觉得它就要被撞得四分五裂了。可以想象到，这种撞击有多么可怕。 博士打量了一下四周。吊篮里几乎没剩下什么了。 “肯尼迪，如果需要的话，你得忍痛割爱，把武器献出去。” “什么？要扔我的武器？”肯尼迪嚷道。 “朋友，我要求你这么做的时候，就说明已经到了万不得已的地步了。” “弗格森，弗格森！” “你的枪支弹药能换来我们的命。” “我们靠近山了！靠近了！”乔喊道。 10托瓦兹！大山还比“维多利亚号”高出10托瓦兹。 乔抱起铺盖扔了出去，仍无济于事。他问也不同肯尼迪，又抓起子弹袋和火药袋往外扔。 这一回，气球升得比危险的山峰高了。阳光已能照亮气球的顶部。但是吊篮还是比峰顶的岩石略低一点，撞到上面难免粉碎。 “肯尼迪！肯尼迪！”博士急促地喊道，“把枪扔了，要不我们全完了。” “等一下，肯尼迪先生！”乔叫了一声，“请等一下！” 听到喊声，肯尼迪扭过头来，只见乔已经在吊篮外面消失了。 “乔！乔！”肯尼迪大声呼唤。 “可怜的乔啊！”博士痛心疾首。 这部分山脊宽20来尺。另一侧的山坡倾斜度更小。吊篮的高度正好与这块相当平坦的高台持平。它擦着咯吱作响的尖石地面飞了过去。 “过去！过去！我们过去了！” 吊篮外面传来几声喊叫。弗格森听见，高兴得心都要跳出来了。 原来，勇敢的小伙子用手抓着吊篮的外沿，脚踏着山顶在跑呢。他这样做就把整个自身的重量从吊篮里减去了。他甚至不得不牢牢抓住吊篮，因为气球总想往上升。跑到另一侧山坡时，前面出现了深渊，乔双臂一叫劲紧紧抓住绳索，麻利地爬进吊篮，回到了同伴身边。 “真诚的乔啊！我的朋友！……”博士激动地说。 “嗳！我这么做，不是为了你们，完全是为了肯尼迪先生的马枪！自从阿拉伯人那件事以后，我一直欠他的情。我这个人不喜欢欠债。现在好了，我们两清了。”他把猎人心爱的马枪递给猎人时，又补充说：“看到您与它分手，我心里实在太难受了。” 肯尼迪用力地握住乔的手，一句话也说不出来。 “维多利亚号”现在只降不升了。这对它来说容易得很。很快，气球降到离地面200尺高的位置， 于是整个又恢复了一种平衡状态。大地好像患了痉挛症似的，高高低低，凸凹不平。夜间，乘着这样一个没有以前那么顺从的气球飞行，很难说不撞到哪儿。天很快黑了下来，不管情愿不情愿，博士只能下决心停下休息，等到第二天天亮以后再走。 “我们得找个合适的地方停下。” “这么说，你终于决定了？”肯尼迪问。 “是的，我早就在考虑一个计划。我们以后就要按它来做。现在不过下午6点，我们还有时间。乔，把锚抛下吧。” 乔立即照办。两只锚垂到了吊篮下面。 “我看见前面有一大片森林。”博士说，“我们就要飞在它上面，到时候，锚会挂住某棵树的。无论如何，我都不会同意在陆地上过夜。” “我们能下去吗？”肯尼迪问。 “下去有什么用？我再给你说一遍，我们分开会很危险的。况且，我还要请求你们帮助做一件非常棘手的活。” “维多利亚号”掠着浩瀚的树林正飞着，突然停住了。显然，锚钩住了树。随着夜幕的降临，风停了。气球几乎一动不动地悬在这片辽阔的“西克莫”树①组成的绿色海洋上空。 ①几种完全不同的树木的通称。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/305/527.html","bookId":166,"book":{"id":166,"title":"气球上的五星期 Five Weeks in a Balloon","description":"简介： Five Weeks in a Balloon, or, Journeys and Discoveries in Africa by Three Englishmen (French: Cinq semaines en ballon) is an adventure novel by Jules Verne.
