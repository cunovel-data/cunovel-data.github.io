It was a sort of island of solid ground in the midst of an immense marsh. Around this fragment of terra firma grew reeds as lofty as trees are in Europe, and stretching away out of sight.\\n\\n These impenetrable swamps gave security to the position of the balloon. It was necessary to watch only the borders of the lake. The vast stretch of water broadened away from the spot, especially toward the east, and nothing could be seen on the horizon, neither mainland nor islands.\\n\\n The two friends had not yet ventured to speak of their recent companion. Kennedy first imparted his conjectures to the doctor.\\n\\n \"Perhaps Joe is not lost after all,\" he said. \"He was a skilful lad, and had few equals as a swimmer. He would find no difficulty in swimming across the Firth of Forth at Edinburgh. We shall see him again--but how and where I know not. Let us omit nothing on our part to give him the chance of rejoining us.\"\\n\\n \"May God grant it as you say, Dick!\" replied the doctor, with much emotion. \"We shall do everything in the world to find our lost friend again. Let us, in the first place, see where we are. But, above all things, let us rid the Victoria of this outside covering, which is of no further use. That will relieve us of six hundred and fifty pounds, a weight not to be despised--and the end is worth the trouble!\"\\n\\n The doctor and Kennedy went to work at once, but they encountered great difficulty. They had to tear the strong silk away piece by piece, and then cut it in narrow strips so as to extricate it from the meshes of the network. The tear made by the beaks of the condors was found to be several feet in length.\\n\\n This operation took at least four hours, but at length the inner balloon once completely extricated did not appear to have suffered in the least degree. The Victoria was thus diminished in size by one fifth, and this difference was sufficiently noticeable to excite Kennedy\u0027s surprise.\\n\\n \"Will it be large enough?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Have no fears on that score, I will reestablish the equilibrium, and should our poor Joe return we shall find a way to start off with him again on our old route.\"\\n\\n \"At the moment of our fall, unless I am mistaken, we were not far from an island.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I recollect it,\" said the doctor, \"but that island, like all the islands on Lake Tchad, is, no doubt, inhabited by a gang of pirates and murderers. They certainly witnessed our misfortune, and should Joe fall into their hands, what will become of him unless protected by their superstitions?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, he\u0027s just the lad to get safely out of the scrape, I repeat. I have great confidence in his shrewdness and skill.\"\\n\\n \"I hope so. Now, Dick, you may go and hunt in the neighborhood, but don\u0027t get far away whatever you do. It has become a pressing necessity for us to renew our stock of provisions, since we had to sacrifice nearly all the old lot.\"\\n\\n \"Very good, doctor, I shall not be long absent.\"\\n\\n Hereupon, Kennedy took a double-barrelled fowling-piece, and strode through the long grass toward a thicket not far off, where the frequent sound of shooting soon let the doctor know that the sportsman was making a good use of his time.\\n\\n Meanwhile Ferguson was engaged in calculating the relative weight of the articles still left in the car, and in establishing the equipoise of the second balloon. He found that there were still left some thirty pounds of pemmican, a supply of tea and coffee, about a gallon and a half of brandy, and one empty water-tank. All the dried meat had disappeared.\\n\\n The doctor was aware that, by the loss of the hydrogen in the first balloon, the ascensional force at his disposal was now reduced to about nine hundred pounds. He therefore had to count upon this difference in order to rearrange his equilibrium. The new balloon measured sixty-seven thousand cubic feet, and contained thirty-three thousand four hundred and eighty feet of gas. The dilating apparatus appeared to be in good condition, and neither the battery nor the spiral had been injured.\\n\\n The ascensional force of the new balloon was then about three thousand pounds, and, in adding together the weight of the apparatus, of the passengers, of the stock of water, of the car and its accessories, and putting aboard fifty gallons of water, and one hundred pounds of fresh meat, the doctor got a total weight of twenty-eight hundred and thirty pounds. He could then take with him one hundred and seventy pounds of ballast, for unforeseen emergencies, and the balloon would be in exact balance with the surrounding atmosphere.\\n\\n His arrangements were completed accordingly, and he made up for Joe\u0027s weight with a surplus of ballast. He spent the whole day in these preparations, and the latter were finished when Kennedy returned. The hunter had been successful, and brought back a regular cargo of geese, wild-duck, snipe, teal, and plover. He went to work at once to draw and smoke the game. Each piece, suspended on a small, thin skewer, was hung over a fire of green wood. When they seemed in good order, Kennedy, who was perfectly at home in the business, packed them away in the car.\\n\\n On the morrow, the hunter was to complete his supplies.\\n\\n Evening surprised our travellers in the midst of this work. Their supper consisted of pemmican, biscuit, and tea; and fatigue, after having given them appetite, brought them sleep. Each of them strained eyes and ears into the gloom during his watch, sometimes fancying that they heard the voice of poor Joe; but, alas! the voice that they so longed to hear, was far away.\\n\\n \"At the first streak of day, the doctor aroused Kennedy.\\n\\n \"I have been long and carefully considering what should be done,\" said he, \"to find our companion.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever your plan may be, doctor, it will suit me. Speak!\"\\n\\n \"Above all things, it is important that Joe should hear from us in some way.\"\\n\\n \"Undoubtedly. Suppose the brave fellow should take it into his head that we have abandoned him?\"\\n\\n \"He! He knows us too well for that. Such a thought would never come into his mind. But he must be informed as to where we are.\"\\n\\n \"How can that be managed?\"\\n\\n \"We shall get into our car and be off again through the air.\"\\n\\n \"But, should the wind bear us away?\"\\n\\n \"Happily, it will not. See, Dick! it is carrying us back to the lake; and this circumstance, which would have been vexatious yesterday, is fortunate now. Our efforts, then, will be limited to keeping ourselves above that vast sheet of water throughout the day. Joe cannot fail to see us, and his eyes will be constantly on the lookout in that direction. Perhaps he will even manage to let us know the place of his retreat.\"\\n\\n \"If he be alone and at liberty, he certainly will.\"\\n\\n \"And if a prisoner,\" resumed the doctor, \"it not being the practice of the natives to confine their captives, he will see us, and comprehend the object of our researches.\"\\n\\n \"But, at last,\" put in Kennedy--\"for we must anticipate every thing--should we find no trace--if he should have left no mark to follow him by, what are we to do?\"\\n\\n \"We shall endeavor to regain the northern part of the lake, keeping ourselves as much in sight as possible. There we\u0027ll wait; we\u0027ll explore the banks; we\u0027ll search the water\u0027s edge, for Joe will assuredly try to reach the shore; and we will not leave the country without having done every thing to find him.\"\\n\\n \"Let us set out, then!\" said the hunter.\\n\\n The doctor hereupon took the exact bearings of the patch of solid land they were about to leave, and arrived at the conclusion that it lay on the north shore of Lake Tchad, between the village of Lari and the village of Ingemini, both visited by Major Denham. During this time Kennedy was completing his stock of fresh meat. Although the neighboring marshes showed traces of the rhinoceros, the lamantine (or manatee), and the hippopotamus, he had no opportunity to see a single specimen of those animals.\\n\\n At seven in the morning, but not without great difficulty --which to Joe would have been nothing--the balloon\u0027s anchor was detached from its hold, the gas dilated, and the new Victoria rose two hundred feet into the air. It seemed to hesitate at first, and went spinning around, like a top; but at last a brisk current caught it, and it advanced over the lake, and was soon borne away at a speed of twenty miles per hour.\\n\\n The doctor continued to keep at a height of from two hundred to five hundred feet. Kennedy frequently discharged his rifle; and, when passing over islands, the aeronauts approached them even imprudently, scrutinizing the thickets, the bushes, the underbrush--in fine, every spot where a mass of shade or jutting rock could have afforded a retreat to their companion. They swooped down close to the long pirogues that navigated the lake; and the wild fishermen, terrified at the sight of the balloon, would plunge into the water and regain their islands with every symptom of undisguised affright.\\n\\n \"We can see nothing,\" said Kennedy, after two hours of search.\\n\\n \"Let us wait a little longer, Dick, and not lose heart. We cannot be far away from the scene of our accident.\"\\n\\n By eleven o\u0027clock the balloon had gone ninety miles. It then fell in with a new current, which, blowing almost at right angles to the other, drove them eastward about sixty miles. It next floated over a very large and populous island, which the doctor took to be Farram, on which the capital of the Biddiomahs is situated. Ferguson expected at every moment to see Joe spring up out of some thicket, flying for his life, and calling for help. Were he free, they could pick him up without trouble; were he a prisoner, they could rescue him by repeating the manoeuvre they had practised to save the missionary, and he would soon be with his friends again; but nothing was seen, not a sound was heard. The case seemed desperate.\\n\\n About half-past two o\u0027clock, the Victoria hove in sight of Tangalia, a village situated on the eastern shore of Lake Tchad, where it marks the extreme point attained by Denham at the period of his exploration.\\n\\n The doctor became uneasy at this persistent setting of the wind in that direction, for he felt that he was being thrown back to the eastward, toward the centre of Africa, and the interminable deserts of that region.\\n\\n \"We must absolutely come to a halt,\" said he, \"and even alight. For Joe\u0027s sake, particularly, we ought to go back to the lake; but, to begin with, let us endeavor to find an opposite current.\"\\n\\n During more than an hour he searched at different altitudes: the balloon always came back toward the mainland. But at length, at the height of a thousand feet, a very violent breeze swept to the northwestward.\\n\\n It was out of the question that Joe should have been detained on one of the islands of the lake; for, in such case he would certainly have found means to make his presence there known. Perhaps he had been dragged to the mainland. The doctor was reasoning thus to himself, when he again came in sight of the northern shore of Lake Tchad.\\n\\n As for supposing that Joe had been drowned, that was not to be believed for a moment. One horrible thought glanced across the minds of both Kennedy and the doctor: caymans swarm in these waters! But neither one nor the other had the courage to distinctly communicate this impression. However, it came up to them so forcibly at last that the doctor said, without further preface:\\n\\n \"Crocodiles are found only on the shores of the islands or of the lake, and Joe will have skill enough to avoid them. Besides, they are not very dangerous; and the Africans bathe with impunity, and quite fearless of their attacks.\"\\n\\n Kennedy made no reply. He preferred keeping quiet to discussing this terrible possibility.\\n\\n The doctor made out the town of Lari about five o\u0027clock in the evening. The inhabitants were at work gathering in their cotton-crop in front of their huts, constructed of woven reeds, and standing in the midst of clean and neatly-kept enclosures. This collection of about fifty habitations occupied a slight depression of the soil, in a valley extending between two low mountains. The force of the wind carried the doctor farther onward than he wanted to go; but it changed a second time, and bore him back exactly to his starting-point, on the sort of enclosed island where he had passed the preceding night. The anchor, instead of catching the branches of the tree, took hold in the masses of reeds mixed with the thick mud of the marshes, which offered considerable resistance.\\n\\n The doctor had much difficulty in restraining the balloon; but at length the wind died away with the setting in of nightfall; and the two friends kept watch together in an almost desperate state of mind.\\n\\n 推测——“维多利亚号”重建平衡——弗格森博士的新打算——肯尼迪打猎——全面查看乍得湖——唐加利亚村——返回湖边——拉利城\\n\\n 第二天， 5月13日，两位旅行家首先勘察了他们所在的这块湖岸。这是大片沼泽地中间的一个小岛， 这种岛的地面由硬邦邦的土构成；在这块硬土地4周，生长着像欧洲的树一样高的芦苇；茂密的芦苇伸向远方，一眼望不到边。\\n\\n 这片无法通行的沼泽地保证了“维多利亚号”的安全，他们只需要注意湖的一侧就行了；尤其是东边，原来就很宽阔的水面更是浩瀚无垠，放眼远眺，直到天际也不见一块陆地或小岛。\\n\\n 两位朋友一直没有勇气提起他们不幸的同伴。现在，肯尼迪终于首先打破了沉默：\\n\\n “乔不可能死的。”他推测说，“他是个机灵的小伙子，少有的游泳好手。他横渡爱丁堡的福思海湾①一点问题也没有。我们一定能见到他。至于何时何地，在什么情况下相见，我不知道，但肯定会见到！至于我们这一万面，也不要放过任何有可能找到他的机会。”\\n\\n ①位于英国苏格兰东南部。\\n\\n “但愿上帝听见你的话，肯尼迪。”博士语气激动地回答，“我们就是把人间的办法用尽，也要找回我们的朋友！首先，我们来定一下方位。不过，要把‘维多利亚号’ 外层的气囊先去掉再说，它已经没用了，这样可以使我们减轻650斤的重量，因此，这工作值得花点力气。”\\n\\n 博士和肯尼迪动手干了起来。他们没少作难。这种塔夫绸材料非常结实，必须一块一块地扯下来，然后用刀割成细条从绳网中掏出来。被猛禽用嘴啄烂的口子有好几尺长。\\n\\n 这项工作至少花了两人4个钟头的时间。 不过万幸的是，在把外面的气囊全去掉后，他们发现里面的气球一点没伤着。这么一来，“维多利亚号”的体积比原来减小了五分之一。这种差别实在太大了，肯尼迪感到不怎么踏实。\\n\\n “它还能带我们飞吗？”他不无担心地问博士。\\n\\n “肯尼迪，关于这一点，你什么也别怕。我会把气球重新搞平衡的，只要我们可怜的乔一回来，我们就能和他一起照常上路。”\\n\\n “弗格森，如果我没弄错的话，我们当时下坠的时候，离一个岛不远。”\\n\\n “我也记得是这样。可是那个岛和乍得湖中所有的岛屿一样，上面肯定也住着当地嗜杀成性的湖上强盗。那些野蛮人肯定看到我们出事了。如果乔落到他们手中，除非他们迷信不敢杀他，否则的话，乔会怎么样就很难说了。”\\n\\n “我再给你说一遍，乔是个善于摆脱困境的人，我相信他的机灵和聪明。”\\n\\n “我也希望如此。现在，肯尼迪，你去周围打点猎吧，不过别走远。我们现在迫切需要补充储备粮，因为，大部分吃的都扔掉了。”\\n\\n “好吧，弗格森，我不会走开很久的。”\\n\\n 肯尼迪拿起一支双筒猎枪，踏着高草向较近的一片矮树林走去。只一会儿功夫，枪声频频响起，弗格森知道，肯尼迪这一次打猎收获肯定不小。\\n\\n 趁这段时间，弗格森一心一意清点吊篮里保存下来的东西，调整第二只气球的平衡。吊篮里剩下有30斤左右干肉饼、一些茶和咖啡、约一加仑半烈酒、一只空空的水箱，所有的干肉都没了。\\n\\n 博士清楚， 由于损失了外面大气球的氢气， “维多利亚号”的上升力减少了900斤左右， 因此，他必须根据这种不同情况，重建气球平衡。新“维多利亚号”的体积是37000立方尺，装有33480立方尺的气体。膨胀氢气用的装备看上去状况良好，无论电池还是蛇形管都没有损坏。\\n\\n 新气球的升力为3000斤左右。博士把仪器、人、储备水、吊篮及其附件、要装上的50加仑水和100斤新鲜肉， 所有的重量加在一起，最后算出总重量为2830斤。他还可以带上170斤的压载物以备不时之需。 这样，气球与周围的空气就保持平衡了。\\n\\n 按照计算安排妥当后，博士又补充了些压载物来代替乔的体重。他把整整一个白天都花在各种各样的准备工作上了。直到肯尼迪回来，一切才就绪。猎人这次打猎收获甚丰，带回一大堆野鹅、野鸭、沙锥等猎物。他一回来就忙着把这些野禽收拾干净，用烟熏制。他把每只野禽插在一根小细棍上，然后吊在新鲜木柴架起的火上熏烤。肯尼迪擅长此道，当他觉得野禽熏制得差不多了，就取下来放到吊篮里储存起来。\\n\\n 第二天，猎人还应该再补充些这类食物。\\n\\n 忙忙碌碌中，俩位旅行家没注意到天竟不知不觉黑了下来。晚饭时，他们吃了些干肉饼和饼干，喝了点茶。干了一天的活，他们早已饥肠辘辘。吃饱喝足后，他们倦意顿生，倒头便睡。每个人值班时，都审视着黑暗，有时甚至以为听到什么地方传来了乔的呼喊声。可是，唉！他们多么想听到的那个声音实在太远了！\\n\\n 天刚一放亮，博士就叫醒了肯尼迪。\\n\\n “我考虑了很久，怎么做才能找到我们的同伴。”博士说。\\n\\n “不管你有什么打算，我都赞成。弗格森，你说吧。”\\n\\n “首先，重要的是要让乔知道我们的消息。”\\n\\n “当然啦！要不，那位可爱的小伙子会以为我们把他抛弃了呢！”\\n\\n “他才不会呢！他太了解我们了！这样的想法他决不会有。不过，他需要知道我们在哪儿。”\\n\\n “怎么才能让他知道呢？”\\n\\n “我们再坐上吊篮升到空中去。”\\n\\n “可是，如果风把我们吹走呢？”\\n\\n “还好，不会的。肯尼迪，你看，这股微风能把我们送回湖的上空。这种风昨天很让人恼火，不过今天对我们却非常有利。我们要做的就是一整天都能飘在这片广阔的水面上。这样，乔不会看不到我们。无论我们在哪儿，他的眼睛肯定时刻都在盯着的。他甚至会想出办法来告诉我们他躲藏在什么地方。”\\n\\n “如果他是一个人，而且是自由的话，他肯定会这么做的。”\\n\\n “假如他被当地人抓住了，”博士接着说，“根据土人的习惯，他们是不把俘虏关押起来的。这样，乔就会看见我们，明白我们在寻找他。”\\n\\n “可是，”肯尼迪说，“如果我们找不到他发出的任何信号，也见不着他留下的任何蛛丝马迹，怎么办呢？什么情况都得预料到啊。”\\n\\n “那我们就试着回到湖的北部去，停在尽可能显眼的地方。我们在那儿等着，搜索一下沿湖地带。乔肯定会想法到那儿的。在没有想尽一切办法找他之前，我们决不离开。”\\n\\n “那我们就动身吧。”猎人急不可耐地说。\\n\\n 博士把他们就要离开的这块硬地的精确位置测定了下来。根据地图和他们所在的位置，博士判定他们位于乍得湖的湖北，拉利城和安热米尼村之间。这两个地方，丹纳姆少校都到过。在博士忙着测量计算的时间里，肯尼迪又去打了趟猎，弄点新鲜肉补充一下储备的食品。尽管附近的沼泽地里犀牛、海牛和河马活动留下的痕迹不少，他却无缘碰见一只这类大动物。\\n\\n 早上7点， 锚从树上取了下来。这活儿别看可怜的乔干起来既快又利索，可肯尼迪却没少作了难。 氢气膨胀起来了，新“维多利亚号”升到了200尺的空中。开始时，气球在原地直打转，不过最后，它还是被一股较大的风裹住，开始向湖的上空移动，不大一会儿，就以每小时20英里的速度飞起来。\\n\\n 博士始终把气球保持在200至500尺之间的高度上。肯尼迪时不时地用马枪放上一枪。临近岛的上空时，他们甚至冒险降低高度靠过去，用目光仔细搜索大大小小的矮树林、灌木丛、荆棘丛。凡是他们认为同伴可以藏身的树荫、岩石坑洼处都不放过。有时，他们降到在湖上划行的长独木舟附近。独木舟上的渔民，一看到气球，无不面露惧色，立即慌慌张张地跳入水中游回他们的岛上去了。\\n\\n “我们什么也没找着。”寻找了2个小时后，肯尼迪失望地说。\\n\\n “再等等，肯尼迪，别泄气，我们现在离出事的地方应该不远。”\\n\\n 11点时，“维多利亚号”已经前进了90英里。这时他们遇上了一股新的气流。这股风几乎是横着吹过来的。气球被风吹得拐了个直角向东飞了约60英里，来到一个人口非常稠密的大岛上空。博士判断这个岛应该是法拉姆岛。比迪奥姆的首府就设在这儿。他期望乔奔跑着，呼喊着从某个灌木丛后突然冒出来。如果乔是自由的，把他吊上来就成了，这没什么难的。如果乔成了土人的囚犯，那就按救传教士的方法再来一次，他很快也就能被救出来，与朋友汇合了。然而，事实上，什么也没出现，什么动静也没有！这实在让人失望！\\n\\n 2点半时，“维多利亚号”已经看得见唐加利亚村了。这个村位于乍得湖东岸，是丹纳姆当年探险时到的最远点。\\n\\n 风始终往这个方向刮，博士担起心来。他觉得他们又被风往东送去，往非洲的中心，往那个永无止境的大沙漠送去。\\n\\n “我们非停下不可了，哪怕着陆也在所不惜。”博士说，“特别是为了乔，我们应该回到湖上去。不过在此之前，我们来想想办法，看能不能找到相反的气流。”\\n\\n 博士用了一个多钟头的时间，在不同的高度中寻找相反方向的气流。这期间，“维多利亚号”一直往陆地漂移。不过最后，幸亏在1000尺的高空找到了一股劲风。气球又被往西北方向吹了回来。\\n\\n “乔不可能留在湖中的某个岛上。否则的话，他肯定能找到方法表明他在什么地方。也许他被带到了陆地。”当博士又看见乍得湖北岸时，思想中产生了这样的推论。\\n\\n 至于认为乔可能被淹死了，这种想法根本不能接受。弗格森和肯尼迪的脑海里几乎同时闪现出一个可怕的想法：这附近的水域中，有大量的凯门鳄呀！但是，两人谁也没勇气把这个顾虑说出来。不过，这种想法一直缠绕着他们，最后，博士终于忍不住了，他没头没脑地说：\\n\\n “在岛边或岸边也会碰到鳄鱼。乔很机灵，会避开的。再说了，鳄鱼也不是那么危险。非洲人在湖里洗澡都不怕遭到鳄鱼袭击，不是也没出过事吗？”\\n\\n 肯尼迪没有作答。他宁可保持沉默也不愿谈论这种可怕的可能性。\\n\\n 下午5点钟左右， 博士向肯尼迪示意，他们到了拉利城的上空。此时，城里的居民正在精耕细作的小块土地上忙着收棉花。这些小块田被一些用芦苇编成的窝棚围着。这片窝棚有50栋左右，都座落在小山间宽阔山谷中略微低洼的地方。这时风力又加大了，不过博士对此并不满意。可是不久风向又一次改变，把“维多利亚号”不偏不倚地送回早晨出发的地点，也就是头天晚上博士和肯尼迪过夜的那个硬地岛的上空。这一次，锚没有勾到树枝，而是勾住了被沼泽地厚厚的淤泥牢牢抓住的几束芦苇。\\n\\n 博士费了很大气力才把气球稳住。夜里，风终于停了，但是两位朋友都没有睡意。他们几乎绝望了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/305/519.html","bookId":166,"book":{"id":166,"title":"气球上的五星期 Five Weeks in a Balloon","description":"简介： Five Weeks in a Balloon, or, Journeys and Discoveries in Africa by Three Englishmen (French: Cinq semaines en ballon) is an adventure novel by Jules Verne.
