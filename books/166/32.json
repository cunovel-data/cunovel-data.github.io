{"id":4782,"no":32,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"The Capital of Bornou.--The Islands of the Biddiomahs.--The Condors.--The Doctor\u0027s Anxieties.--His Precautions.--An Attack in Mid-air.--The Balloon Covering torn.--The Fall.--Sublime Self-Sacrifice.--The Northern Coast of the Lake.\\n\\n Since its arrival at Lake Tchad, the balloon had struck a current that edged it farther to the westward. A few clouds tempered the heat of the day, and, besides, a little air could be felt over this vast expanse of water; but about one o\u0027clock, the Victoria, having slanted across this part of the lake, again advanced over the land for a space of seven or eight miles.\\n\\n The doctor, who was somewhat vexed at first at this turn of his course, no longer thought of complaining when he caught sight of the city of Kouka, the capital of Bornou. He saw it for a moment, encircled by its walls of white clay, and a few rudely-constructed mosques rising clumsily above that conglomeration of houses that look like playing-dice, which form most Arab towns. In the court-yards of the private dwellings, and on the public squares, grew palms and caoutchouc-trees topped with a dome of foliage more than one hundred feet in breadth. Joe called attention to the fact that these immense parasols were in proper accordance with the intense heat of the sun, and made thereon some pious reflections which it were needless to repeat.\\n\\n Kouka really consists of two distinct towns, separated by the \"Dendal,\" a large boulevard three hundred yards wide, at that hour crowded with horsemen and foot passengers. On one side, the rich quarter stands squarely with its airy and lofty houses, laid out in regular order; on the other, is huddled together the poor quarter, a miserable collection of low hovels of a conical shape, in which a poverty-stricken multitude vegetate rather than live, since Kouka is neither a trading nor a commercial city.\\n\\n Kennedy thought it looked something like Edinburgh, were that city extended on a plain, with its two distinct boroughs.\\n\\n But our travellers had scarcely the time to catch even this glimpse of it, for, with the fickleness that characterizes the air-currents of this region, a contrary wind suddenly swept them some forty miles over the surface of Lake Tchad.\\n\\n Then then were regaled with a new spectacle. They could count the numerous islets of the lake, inhabited by the Biddiomahs, a race of bloodthirsty and formidable pirates, who are as greatly feared when neighbors as are the Touaregs of Sahara.\\n\\n These estimable people were in readiness to receive the Victoria bravely with stones and arrows, but the balloon quickly passed their islands, fluttering over them, from one to the other with butterfly motion, like a gigantic beetle.\\n\\n At this moment, Joe, who was scanning the horizon, said to Kennedy:\\n\\n \"There, sir, as you are always thinking of good sport, yonder is just the thing for you!\"\\n\\n \"What is it, Joe?\"\\n\\n \"This time, the doctor will not disapprove of your shooting.\"\\n\\n \"But what is it?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you see that flock of big birds making for us?\"\\n\\n \"Birds?\" exclaimed the doctor, snatching his spyglass.\\n\\n \"I see them,\" replied Kennedy; \"there are at least a dozen of them.\"\\n\\n \"Fourteen, exactly!\" said Joe.\\n\\n \"Heaven grant that they may be of a kind sufficiently noxious for the doctor to let me peg away at them!\"\\n\\n \"I should not object, but I would much rather see those birds at a distance from us!\"\\n\\n \"Why, are you afraid of those fowls?\"\\n\\n \"They are condors, and of the largest size. Should they attack us--\"\\n\\n \"Well, if they do, we\u0027ll defend ourselves. We have a whole arsenal at our disposal. I don\u0027t think those birds are so very formidable.\"\\n\\n \"Who can tell?\" was the doctor\u0027s only remark.\\n\\n Ten minutes later, the flock had come within gunshot, and were making the air ring with their hoarse cries. They came right toward the Victoria, more irritated than frightened by her presence.\\n\\n \"How they scream! What a noise!\" said Joe.\\n\\n \"Perhaps they don\u0027t like to see anybody poaching in their country up in the air, or daring to fly like themselves!\"\\n\\n \"Well, now, to tell the truth, when I take a good look at them, they are an ugly, ferocious set, and I should think them dangerous enough if they were armed with Purdy-Moore rifles,\" admitted Kennedy.\\n\\n \"They have no need of such weapons,\" said Ferguson, looking very grave.\\n\\n The condors flew around them in wide circles, their flight growing gradually closer and closer to the balloon. They swept through the air in rapid, fantastic curves, occasionally precipitating themselves headlong with the speed of a bullet, and then breaking their line of projection by an abrupt and daring angle.\\n\\n The doctor, much disquieted, resolved to ascend so as to escape this dangerous proximity. He therefore dilated the hydrogen in his balloon, and it rapidly rose.\\n\\n But the condors mounted with him, apparently determined not to part company.\\n\\n \"They seem to mean mischief!\" said the hunter, cocking his rifle.\\n\\n And, in fact, they were swooping nearer, and more than one came within fifty feet of them, as if defying the fire-arms.\\n\\n \"By George, I\u0027m itching to let them have it!\" exclaimed Kennedy.\\n\\n \"No, Dick; not now! Don\u0027t exasperate them needlessly. That would only be exciting them to attack us!\"\\n\\n \"But I could soon settle those fellows!\"\\n\\n \"You may think so, Dick. But you are wrong!\"\\n\\n \"Why, we have a bullet for each of them!\"\\n\\n \"And suppose that they were to attack the upper part of the balloon, what would you do? How would you get at them? Just imagine yourself in the presence of a troop of lions on the plain, or a school of sharks in the open ocean! For travellers in the air, this situation is just as dangerous.\"\\n\\n \"Are you speaking seriously, doctor?\"\\n\\n \"Very seriously, Dick.\"\\n\\n \"Let us wait, then!\"\\n\\n \"Wait! Hold yourself in readiness in case of an attack, but do not fire without my orders.\"\\n\\n The birds then collected at a short distance, yet to near that their naked necks, entirely bare of feathers, could be plainly seen, as they stretched them out with the effort of their cries, while their gristly crests, garnished with a comb and gills of deep violet, stood erect with rage. They were of the very largest size, their bodies being more than three feet in length, and the lower surface of their white wings glittering in the sunlight. They might well have been considered winged sharks, so striking was their resemblance to those ferocious rangers of the deep.\\n\\n \"They are following us!\" said the doctor, as he saw them ascending with him, \"and, mount as we may, they can fly still higher!\"\\n\\n \"Well, what are we to do?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n The doctor made no answer.\\n\\n \"Listen, Samuel!\" said the sportsman. \"There are fourteen of those birds; we have seventeen shots at our disposal if we discharge all our weapons. Have we not the means, then, to destroy them or disperse them? I will give a good account of some of them!\"\\n\\n \"I have no doubt of your skill, Dick; I look upon all as dead that may come within range of your rifle, but I repeat that, if they attack the upper part of the balloon, you could not get a sight at them. They would tear the silk covering that sustains us, and we are three thousand feet up in the air!\"\\n\\n At this moment, one of the ferocious birds darted right at the balloon, with outstretched beak and claws, ready to rend it with either or both.\\n\\n \"Fire! fire at once!\" cried the doctor.\\n\\n He had scarcely ceased, ere the huge creature, stricken dead, dropped headlong, turning over and over in space as he fell.\\n\\n Kennedy had already grasped one of the two-barrelled fowling-pieces and Joe was taking aim with another.\\n\\n Frightened by the report, the condors drew back for a moment, but they almost instantly returned to the charge with extreme fury. Kennedy severed the head of one from its body with his first shot, and Joe broke the wing of another.\\n\\n \"Only eleven left,\" said he.\\n\\n Thereupon the birds changed their tactics, and by common consent soared above the balloon. Kennedy glanced at Ferguson. The latter, in spite of his imperturbability, grew pale. Then ensued a moment of terrifying silence. In the next they heard a harsh tearing noise, as of something rending the silk, and the car seemed to sink from beneath the feet of our three aeronauts.\\n\\n \"We are lost!\" exclaimed Ferguson, glancing at the barometer, which was now swiftly rising.\\n\\n \"Over with the ballast!\" he shouted, \"over with it!\"\\n\\n And in a few seconds the last lumps of quartz had disappeared.\\n\\n \"We are still falling! Empty the water-tanks! Do you hear me, Joe? We are pitching into the lake!\"\\n\\n Joe obeyed. The doctor leaned over and looked out. The lake seemed to come up toward him like a rising tide. Every object around grew rapidly in size while they were looking at it. The car was not two hundred feet from the surface of Lake Tchad.\\n\\n \"The provisions! the provisions!\" cried the doctor.\\n\\n And the box containing them was launched into space.\\n\\n Their descent became less rapid, but the luckless aeronauts were still falling, and into the lake.\\n\\n \"Throw out something--something more!\" cried the doctor.\\n\\n \"There is nothing more to throw!\" was Kennedy\u0027s despairing response.\\n\\n \"Yes, there is!\" called Joe, and with a wave of the hand he disappeared like a flash, over the edge of the car.\\n\\n \"Joe! Joe!\" exclaimed the doctor, horror-stricken.\\n\\n The Victoria thus relieved resumed her ascending motion, mounted a thousand feet into the air, and the wind, burying itself in the disinflated covering, bore them away toward the northern part of the lake.\\n\\n \"Lost!\" exclaimed the sportsman, with a gesture of despair.\\n\\n \"Lost to save us!\" responded Ferguson.\\n\\n And these men, intrepid as they were, felt the large tears streaming down their cheeks. They leaned over with the vain hope of seeing some trace of their heroic companion, but they were already far away from him.\\n\\n \"What course shall we pursue?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n \"Alight as soon as possible, Dick, and then wait.\"\\n\\n After a sweep of some sixty miles the Victoria halted on a desert shore, on the north of the lake. The anchors caught in a low tree and the sportsman fastened it securely. Night came, but neither Ferguson nor Kennedy could find one moment\u0027s sleep.\\n\\n 博尔努的首府——比迪奥玛人的小岛——胡兀鹫——博士的忧虑——戒备——空中袭击——气囊破了——下落——崇高的牺牲精神——乍得湖北岸\\n\\n 自从到达乍得湖上空后，“维多利亚号”就遇上了一股向西去的气流。乌云使白天的炎热减缓了许多，在这广阔的水面上可以感到有些凉风阵阵袭来。下午将近1点时，气球斜飞过了湖面，而后，又在陆地上空飞了七八英里。\\n\\n 最初，博士对往这个方向去感到有点遗憾。但是，当他看到博尔努的著名首府库卡城时，也就不再抱怨了。过了一会儿，可以大致看清由白粘土城墙环绕的库卡城了；几座建筑相当粗糙的清真寺笨拙地耸立在一大片方形阿拉伯式样的房子上空；在一户户人家的庭院里和公共场所生长着一些埃及姜果棕树①和橡胶树，树的顶部由宽大的树叶构成直径100尺的绿色苍穹， 像一把把巨大的阳伞。乔提醒同伴们注意这些树冠的大小与阳光的热度有关，他由此得出上帝非常可爱的结论。\\n\\n ①一种大型的扇状棕榈类植物，果实的汁浆和皮含有姜味，可用作饮料。\\n\\n 库卡实际上是由两座不同的城组成的。 两城之间有一条300托瓦兹长的宽阔林荫大道相连。当地人把这条道称为“当达尔”。这个时候，道上步行的和骑马的络绎不绝。路这边的城，房子间隔很远，且高大通风，一看就知道主人比较富裕；另一边的城，房屋非常简陋，低矮呈圆锥形的草棚，鳞次栉比，显然，里面住的都是生活拮据的穷人，因为，库卡城里既没有商业也没有工业。\\n\\n 肯尼迪发觉这座城与爱丁堡有几分相似。它们都是由两个完全不同的城组成，只不过，爱丁堡是建在平原上。\\n\\n 但是，这一地区的风向总是变幻不定，几位旅行家还没来得及好好看一眼库卡城，突然，一阵逆风刮来，“维多利亚号”被裹着向后退了约40英里，又回到了乍得湖上空。\\n\\n 湖面上出现了一种新的景致，众多岛屿星罗棋布。岛上住着非常凶恶的比迪奥玛人。他们是些嗜血成性的湖上强盗，和撒哈拉大沙漠的游牧民族图瓦雷格人一样，常常令附近地区的人们感到不安。正当这些野人大着胆子准备用弓箭和石子来迎接“维多利亚号”时，气球却像一只大金龟子一样飞舞着很快越过了他们的头顶。\\n\\n 在此期间，乔一直注视着地平线上空。这时，他对肯尼迪说：\\n\\n “肯尼迪先生，我敢肯定，您一直梦想着打猎，喏，现在您有事干了。”\\n\\n “噢，怎么回事，乔？”\\n\\n “这一次，您开枪，我的主人肯定不会反对。”\\n\\n “到底出了什么事？”\\n\\n “您没瞧见那边有一群大鸟正向我们飞过来吗？”\\n\\n “鸟？”博士听到后，立即抓起望远镜观察。\\n\\n “我看见了。”肯尼迪证实道，“它们至少有一打。”\\n\\n “14只呢，肯尼迪先生。”乔更正道。\\n\\n “老天哪，但愿它们是害鸟！这样的话，我们开枪，好心肠的弗格森就没什么好说的了。”\\n\\n “我没什么可说的，”弗格森博士回答道，“但是，我宁愿那些鸟离我们远点儿！”\\n\\n “为什么，主人？您怕那些长翅膀的家伙吗？”乔有些不明白。\\n\\n “乔，那是些胡兀鹫，而且是身子最大的那种，如果它们攻击我们……。”\\n\\n “弗格森，怕什么，我们自卫就是了！反正有一军火库的武器弹药等着它们呢。我就不信这些鸟有那么可怕！”\\n\\n “谁知道呢？”博士有点担心地回答。\\n\\n 10分钟后，鸟群已飞得很近，猎枪完全可以打着了。这14只胡兀鹫的嘶哑叫声在空中响成一片，它们渐渐向“维多利亚号”靠近。显然，气球的出现不仅没有使它们感到害怕，反而更激怒了它们。\\n\\n “它们叫得多响！翅膀拍打得多厉害！”乔猜测，“这些鸟看到有人侵入它们的领地，而且胆敢和它们一样飞，可能觉得很不自在。”\\n\\n “老实说，它们的样子够吓人了。”猎人接着说，“如果这群胡兀鹫配上一只珀迪摩尔马枪的话，我相信它们肯定够凶狠的。”\\n\\n “他们不需要那东西。”弗格森回答。他的神情越来越严肃了。\\n\\n 胡兀鹫追逐着“维多利亚号”，在气球周围形成了一个大圆。它们以令人难以置信的速度在空中飞快地穿来穿去，逐渐缩小了包围圈。它们时而像流星坠地似的突然俯冲，时而像出膛的子弹直冲云霄，时而又翅膀一侧骤然改变飞行方向。\\n\\n 博士忧心忡忡，决心把气球升到高处的大气层中以避开这些危险的猛禽。氢气迅速膨胀起来，“维多利亚号”开始上升。但是，胡兀鹫也随着一起往上飞。看来，它们不打算放弃气球。\\n\\n “显然，它们是要和我们过不去了。”猎人一边说，一边往马枪里装子弹。\\n\\n 果然，这些鸟越飞越近了，有几只距气球几乎不到50尺远。它们好像根本就不在乎肯尼迪手中的武器。\\n\\n “我真想给它们来几枪。”猎人有些按捺不住了。\\n\\n “肯尼迪，不行！千万别开枪！可不要无缘无故惹恼了它们。那样做只会刺激它们来攻击我们。”\\n\\n “可是，我能轻而易举地干掉它们呀。”\\n\\n “肯尼迪，你弄错了。”\\n\\n “这么几只鸟，我们一枪一只，有什么错的？”\\n\\n “如果他们冲到气球上面去，你怎么打得着它们呢？想想你在陆地上面对一群狮子，或在海上面对一群鲨鱼时的情形吧！对于乘气球上天的人来说，这和那一样危险。”\\n\\n “弗格森，你这话当真？”\\n\\n “肯尼迪，千真万确。”\\n\\n “那么，我们就等等吧。”\\n\\n “是的，你先等等。不过，你要随时准备着，万一遭到攻击，我们只有自卫。还是那句话，没有我的命令别开枪。”\\n\\n 这时，胡兀鹫越聚越近了。它们因拼命尖叫而鼓起的光秃秃的脖子和头顶上因恼怒而竖起的紫色肉冠已清晰可辨。 这是些最大个的胡兀鹫，身长超过3尺，白白的翅膀伸展着，阳光透过翅翼闪闪发亮。它们的凶恶程度完全可以与鲨鱼相比，可以说，它们就是长着翅膀的鲨鱼。\\n\\n “它们一直在跟着我们，”博士看见胡兀鹫随同气球一起上升，不无担心地说，“看来，升多高也没用，它们飞得比我们还高呢！”\\n\\n “你说怎么办？”肯尼迪问。\\n\\n 博士没有作答。\\n\\n “弗格森，你听着，”猎人又说，“这些鸟共14只。我们所有的武器装满子弹后，一共可以打17枪。难道这还不能把它们全消灭或赶走吗？一大半包在我身上好了。”\\n\\n “肯尼迪，对你的枪法，我毫不怀疑。就算凡是从你枪口下过的胡兀鹫都被你打死了，可是，我再给你说一遍，只要它们扑到气球上面一点，你就看不到了。它们会把带我们上天的气囊抓破，到那时，可就麻烦了。要知道，我们现在是在离地球3000尺的高空啊！”\\n\\n 说话间，一只最凶狠的大鸟，张着嘴，伸着爪子，向“维多利亚号”俯冲过来，准备啄破和撕烂气球。\\n\\n “开枪！快开枪！”博士急忙高喊。\\n\\n 话音未落，鸟被子弹击中，死尸打着转掉了下去。\\n\\n 原来，肯尼迪手里早已抓着一杆双筒猎枪等候多时了，旁边的乔也端着一支枪跃跃欲试。\\n\\n 胡兀鹫听到枪声吓得离开了片刻，但是几乎马上又极其疯狂地扑了上来。肯尼迪第一枪打掉了离得最近的一只胡兀鹫的头，乔一枪打碎了另一只的翅膀。\\n\\n “只剩下11只了。”他嘴里算着。\\n\\n 但是，余下的胡兀鹫这时改变了攻击策略。它们一起飞到“维多利亚号”上面去了。肯尼迪望望弗格森，博士虽然面无表情，极力控制住自己，但脸色变得苍白。3个人谁也不再说话。 一阵令人忐忑不安的沉寂后，头顶上传来撕绸子一般刺耳的撕裂声。三位旅行者马上感觉到脚下的吊篮在下沉。\\n\\n “我们完了！”弗格森眼睛紧紧盯住水银柱急速下降的气压表，叫了一声。之后，他又补充道：\\n\\n “快扔压载物！快扔！”\\n\\n 眨眼间，所有的石英块扔光了。\\n\\n “我们还在下落！把水箱倒空！乔！你听见了吗？我们就要掉进湖里了！”\\n\\n 乔照着主人的话做了。博士俯下身子瞧，只见湖水像上涨的海潮一样向他们迎来，眼看着湖中的物体在迅速变大。转眼间，吊篮距乍得湖面不到200尺了。\\n\\n “吃的！把吃的扔掉！”博士又喊。\\n\\n 于是，装着食物的箱子被扔了出去。下坠的速度放慢了，可是仍没有停止。\\n\\n “扔啊！再扔啊！”博士最后一次喊道。\\n\\n “再没有东西可扔了。”肯尼迪回答。\\n\\n “不！还有呢！”乔简洁地答道，同时一只手在胸前飞快地划了个十字，然后，翻出吊篮跳了下去。\\n\\n “乔！乔！”博士吓坏了。\\n\\n 但是，乔已听不见他的呼喊了。减轻了负重的“维多利亚号”不再下落。它重新上升，一直到1000尺的空中。风拼命往漏了气的气囊里灌，同时吹着气球向湖北岸飘去。\\n\\n “他完了！”猎人做了个绝望的手势，说。\\n\\n “他这是舍了命来救我们啊！”弗格森补充道。\\n\\n 说着，两位勇敢的人的眼中滚出大颗大颗的泪珠。他们俯在吊篮边上往下望，极力搜寻可怜的乔的踪迹。可是，风已经把他们吹得太远了，哪里还找得到乔的影子。\\n\\n “我们现在怎么办？”肯尼迪问。\\n\\n “肯尼迪，只要一有可能，我们就着陆，然后等着。”\\n\\n 气球飘了60英里后，在湖北岸一块荒僻的地方停了下来。锚勾住一棵不太高的树，猎人下去把它牢牢固定住。\\n\\n 夜幕降临了。但是整整一个晚上，无论是弗格森，还是肯尼迪都无法合住眼睛。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/305/518.html","bookId":166,"book":{"id":166,"title":"气球上的五星期 Five Weeks in a Balloon","description":"简介： Five Weeks in a Balloon, or, Journeys and Discoveries in Africa by Three Englishmen (French: Cinq semaines en ballon) is an adventure novel by Jules Verne.
