{"id":4777,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 27","content":"Terrific Heat.--Hallucinations.--The Last Drops of Water.--Nights of Despair.--An Attempt at Suicide.--The Simoom.--The Oasis.--The Lion and Lioness.\n The doctor\u0027s first care, on the morrow, was to consult the barometer. He found that the mercury had scarcely undergone any perceptible depression.\n \"Nothing!\" he murmured, \"nothing!\"\n He got out of the car and scrutinized the weather; there was only the same heat, the same cloudless sky, the same merciless drought.\n \"Must we, then, give up to despair?\" he exclaimed, in agony.\n Joe did not open his lips. He was buried in his own thoughts, and planning the expedition he had proposed.\n Kennedy got up, feeling very ill, and a prey to nervous agitation. He was suffering horribly with thirst, and his swollen tongue and lips could hardly articulate a syllable.\n There still remained a few drops of water. Each of them knew this, and each was thinking of it, and felt himself drawn toward them; but neither of the three dared to take a step.\n Those three men, friends and companions as they were, fixed their haggard eyes upon each other with an instinct of ferocious longing, which was most plainly revealed in the hardy Scot, whose vigorous constitution yielded the soonest to these unnatural privations.\n Throughout the day he was delirious, pacing up and down, uttering hoarse cries, gnawing his clinched fists, and ready to open his veins and drink his own hot blood.\n \"Ah!\" he cried, \"land of thirst! Well might you be called the land of despair!\"\n At length he sank down in utter prostration, and his friends heard no other sound from him than the hissing of his breath between his parched and swollen lips.\n Toward evening, Joe had his turn of delirium. The vast expanse of sand appeared to him an immense pond, full of clear and limpid water; and, more than once, he dashed himself upon the scorching waste to drink long draughts, and rose again with his mouth clogged with hot dust.\n \"Curses on it!\" he yelled, in his madness, \"it\u0027s nothing but salt water!\"\n Then, while Ferguson and Kennedy lay there motionless, the resistless longing came over him to drain the last few drops of water that had been kept in reserve. The natural instinct proved too strong. He dragged himself toward the car, on his knees; he glared at the bottle containing the precious fluid; he gave one wild, eager glance, seized the treasured store, and bore it to his lips.\n At that instant he heard a heart-rending cry close beside him--\"Water! water!\"\n It was Kennedy, who had crawled up close to him, and was begging there, upon his knees, and weeping piteously.\n Joe, himself in tears, gave the poor wretch the bottle, and Kennedy drained the last drop with savage haste.\n \"Thanks!\" he murmured hoarsely, but Joe did not hear him, for both alike had dropped fainting on the sand.\n What took place during that fearful night neither of them knew, but, on Tuesday morning, under those showers of heat which the sun poured down upon them, the unfortunate men felt their limbs gradually drying up, and when Joe attempted to rise he found it impossible.\n He looked around him. In the car, the doctor, completely overwhelmed, sat with his arms folded on his breast, gazing with idiotic fixedness upon some imaginary point in space. Kennedy was frightful to behold. He was rolling his head from right to left like a wild beast in a cage.\n All at once, his eyes rested on the butt of his rifle, which jutted above the rim of the car.\n \"Ah!\" he screamed, raising himself with a superhuman effort.\n Desperate, mad, he snatched at the weapon, and turned the barrel toward his mouth.\n \"Kennedy!\" shouted Joe, throwing himself upon his friend.\n \"Let go! hands off!\" moaned the Scot, in a hoarse, grating voice--and then the two struggled desperately for the rifle.\n \"Let go, or I\u0027ll kill you!\" repeated Kennedy. But Joe clung to him only the more fiercely, and they had been contending thus without the doctor seeing them for many seconds, when, suddenly the rifle went off. At the sound of its discharge, the doctor rose up erect, like a spectre, and glared around him.\n But all at once his glance grew more animated; he extended his hand toward the horizon, and in a voice no longer human shrieked:\n \"There! there--off there!\"\n There was such fearful force in the cry that Kennedy and Joe released each other, and both looked where the doctor pointed.\n The plain was agitated like the sea shaken by the fury of a tempest; billows of sand went tossing over each other amid blinding clouds of dust; an immense pillar was seen whirling toward them through the air from the southeast, with terrific velocity; the sun was disappearing behind an opaque veil of cloud whose enormous barrier extended clear to the horizon, while the grains of fine sand went gliding together with all the supple ease of liquid particles, and the rising dust-tide gained more and more with every second.\n Ferguson\u0027s eyes gleamed with a ray of energetic hope.\n \"The simoom!\" he exclaimed.\n \"The simoom!\" repeated Joe, without exactly knowing what it meant.\n \"So much the better!\" said Kennedy, with the bitterness of despair. \"So much the better--we shall die!\"\n \"So much the better!\" echoed the doctor, \"for we shall live!\" and, so saying, he began rapidly to throw out the sand that encumbered the car.\n At length his companions understood him, and took their places at his side.\n \"And now, Joe,\" said the doctor, \"throw out some fifty pounds of your ore, there!\"\n Joe no longer hesitated, although he still felt a fleeting pang of regret. The balloon at once began to ascend.\n \"It was high time!\" said the doctor.\n The simoom, in fact, came rushing on like a thunderbolt, and a moment later the balloon would have been crushed, torn to atoms, annihilated. The awful whirlwind was almost upon it, and it was already pelted with showers of sand driven like hail by the storm.\n \"Out with more ballast!\" shouted the doctor.\n \"There!\" responded Joe, tossing over a huge fragment of quartz.\n With this, the Victoria rose swiftly above the range of the whirling column, but, caught in the vast displacement of the atmosphere thereby occasioned, it was borne along with incalculable rapidity away above this foaming sea.\n The three travellers did not speak. They gazed, and hoped, and even felt refreshed by the breath of the tempest.\n About three o\u0027clock, the whirlwind ceased; the sand, falling again upon the desert, formed numberless little hillocks, and the sky resumed its former tranquillity.\n The balloon, which had again lost its momentum, was floating in sight of an oasis, a sort of islet studded with green trees, thrown up upon the surface of this sandy ocean.\n \"Water! we\u0027ll find water there!\" said the doctor.\n And, instantly, opening the upper valve, he let some hydrogen escape, and slowly descended, taking the ground at about two hundred feet from the edge of the oasis.\n In four hours the travellers had swept over a distance of two hundred and forty miles!\n The car was at once ballasted, and Kennedy, closely followed by Joe, leaped out.\n \"Take your guns with you!\" said the doctor; \"take your guns, and be careful!\"\n Dick grasped his rifle, and Joe took one of the fowling-pieces. They then rapidly made for the trees, and disappeared under the fresh verdure, which announced the presence of abundant springs. As they hurried on, they had not taken notice of certain large footprints and fresh tracks of some living creature marked here and there in the damp soil.\n Suddenly, a dull roar was heard not twenty paces from them.\n \"The roar of a lion!\" said Joe.\n \"Good for that!\" said the excited hunter; \"we\u0027ll fight him. A man feels strong when only a fight\u0027s in question.\"\n \"But be careful, Mr. Kennedy; be careful! The lives of all depend upon the life of one.\"\n But Kennedy no longer heard him; he was pushing on, his eye blazing; his rifle cocked; fearful to behold in his daring rashness. There, under a palm-tree, stood an enormous black-maned lion, crouching for a spring on his antagonist. Scarcely had he caught a glimpse of the hunter, when he bounded through the air; but he had not touched the ground ere a bullet pierced his heart, and he fell to the earth dead.\n \"Hurrah! hurrah!\" shouted Joe, with wild exultation.\n Kennedy rushed toward the well, slid down the dampened steps, and flung himself at full length by the side of a fresh spring, in which he plunged his parched lips. Joe followed suit, and for some minutes nothing was heard but the sound they made with their mouths, drinking more like maddened beasts than men.\n \"Take care, Mr. Kennedy,\" said Joe at last; \"let us not overdo the thing!\" and he panted for breath.\n But Kennedy, without a word, drank on. He even plunged his hands, and then his head, into the delicious tide--he fairly revelled in its coolness.\n \"But the doctor?\" said Joe; \"our friend, Dr. Ferguson?\"\n That one word recalled Kennedy to himself, and, hastily filling a flask that he had brought with him, he started on a run up the steps of the well.\n But what was his amazement when he saw an opaque body of enormous dimensions blocking up the passage! Joe, who was close upon Kennedy\u0027s heels, recoiled with him.\n \"We are blocked in--entrapped!\"\n \"Impossible! What does that mean?--\"\n Dick had no time to finish; a terrific roar made him only too quickly aware what foe confronted him.\n \"Another lion!\" exclaimed Joe.\n \"A lioness, rather,\" said Kennedy. \"Ah! ferocious brute!\" he added, \"I\u0027ll settle you in a moment more!\" and swiftly reloaded his rifle.\n In another instant he fired, but the animal had disappeared.\n \"Onward!\" shouted Kennedy.\n \"No!\" interposed the other, \"that shot did not kill her; her body would have rolled down the steps; she\u0027s up there, ready to spring upon the first of us who appears, and he would be a lost man!\"\n \"But what are we to do? We must get out of this, and the doctor is expecting us.\"\n \"Let us decoy the animal. Take my piece, and give me your rifle.\"\n \"What is your plan?\"\n \"You\u0027ll see.\"\n And Joe, taking off his linen jacket, hung it on the end of the rifle, and thrust it above the top of the steps. The lioness flung herself furiously upon it. Kennedy was on the alert for her, and his bullet broke her shoulder. The lioness, with a frightful howl of agony, rolled down the steps, overturning Joe in her fall. The poor fellow imagined that he could already feel the enormous paws of the savage beast in his flesh, when a second detonation resounded in the narrow passage, and Dr. Ferguson appeared at the opening above with his gun in hand, and still smoking from the discharge.\n Joe leaped to his feet, clambered over the body of the dead lioness, and handed up the flask full of sparkling water to his master.\n To carry it to his lips, and to half empty it at a draught, was the work of an instant, and the three travellers offered up thanks from the depths of their hearts to that Providence who had so miraculously saved them.\n 热得可怕——幻觉——最后几滴水——绝望的一夜——自杀未遂——西蒙风①——沙漠绿洲——雄狮和雌狮\n ①非洲和阿拉伯等沙漠中刮的干热风。\n 第二天，博士醒来后第一件事就是查看气压表。水银柱几乎没有一点变化。\n “一点没降，一点没降！”他喃喃自语道。\n 他爬出吊篮，审视了一下；天气依然那么热，天空依然那么晴，一切依然难以改变。\n “难道真的没有希望了？”他吼了一声。\n 乔一句话不说，仍在想着心事，考虑着他的冒险计划。\n 肯尼迪站了起来，脸上一付病态，并表现出一种令人担忧的极度亢奋。他在受着干渴的可怕折磨。他艰难地蠕动着肿胀的舌头和嘴唇，几乎发不出声音来。\n 吊篮里还剩有一点少的可怜的水。每个人心里都清楚，每个人都时刻挂念着，而且都强烈感受到它的吸引，但是谁也不肯提出来。\n 这三位同伴，三个朋友，怀着野兽般的贪婪，两眼喷火，虎视眈眈地互相张望着。肯尼迪表现得尤为突出。他人高体壮，需求量大，因此比别人更容易缺水。整整一个白天，他都处在极度亢奋之中。他一直走来走去，嘶哑地吼叫着，咬着自己的拳头，好像就要把血管爆裂，好喝血似的。\n “哈哈！好一个干渴之地！”他大喊大叫，“你的确称得上叫‘绝望之地’了！”\n 随后，他陷入了极度虚脱，只有那干裂的嘴唇里传出粗粗的呼吸声。\n 将近天黑时分，乔也开始变得疯疯癫癫的了。这片广阔的沙洲在他眼中成了一池盛满清彻透明水的大水塘。他一次又一次地扑到火烧般的大地上就喝。每次站起来时，都是满嘴的细沙。\n “该死！”他气愤地大叫，“是咸水！”\n 看到弗格森和肯尼迪一动不动地躺着，乔这时产生了一种遏制不住的念头，一心想把留下的那点可怜的水喝光。这种念头非常强烈，他不由自主地连滚带爬奔到吊篮前。他的眼睛一下子就死死盯住了装着水的瓶子。瓶子里的水诱人地晃动着。他一把抓起瓶子就往嘴里送。\n 就在这时，他耳边响起了几声凄厉的叫声：“喝水！喝水！”\n 那是肯尼迪在喊叫，他正在向乔旁边爬来。这位不幸的人样子让人可怜，他跪着，哭着向乔哀求。乔哭了，把瓶子递给了肯尼迪。肯尼迪接过瓶来，一气把水喝个精光，连一滴也没剩下。\n “谢谢。”他说完，便躺在了地上。\n 但是，乔没听见，他象肯尼迪一样倒在了沙面上。\n 这个可怕的夜里所发生的事谁也不知道。星期二早上，在阳光倾泻的火雨下，这些不幸的人感到他们的肢体在一点点干枯。乔想站起来，然而，根本做不到。他已无法实施他的计划了。\n 他往周围望了一眼；吊篮里，博士神情沮丧，双手交叉在胸前，傻呆呆地盯着空间想象中的一个点；肯尼迪样子可怕，头左右摇晃着，像关在笼子里的一头野兽。\n 突然，猎人的目光落在了他的马枪上。枪托在吊篮外边伸着。\n “啊！”他使出超人的气力喊着，站了起来，发疯般地扑向马枪，一把抓过来就把枪口对准自己的嘴。\n “先生！先生！”乔叫着，急忙冲向肯尼迪。\n “别管我！走开！”苏格兰人发着嘶哑的喘息声，叫道。\n 两人激烈地争斗起来。\n “走开，要不我打死你。”肯尼迪不停地叫着。\n 但是，乔拼命紧紧抓住他，就是不松手。他们就这样搏来斗去，互不相让。博士在旁边就像没有看见他们似的。两人厮打了将近一分钟，马枪忽然间响了。听到枪声，博士幽灵般地笔直站了起来，凝视着周围。突然，他的目光有了生气。他抬起手指向地平线，怪声怪调地喊道：\n “那！那！瞧那儿！”\n 他的举动非常奏效，乔和肯尼迪立刻停止了搏斗，两人都往博士手指的方向望去。\n 远处，平荒大漠翻腾起滚滚沙浪，如同风暴下咆哮的大海。只见波涛汹涌，一浪接着一浪，沙漠上空被搅起大量的细沙；东南方向，一根硕大的沙柱以惊人的速度飞快地旋转着，正逐渐往这儿逼近；转眼间，火辣辣的骄阳消失在一块昏黑的乌云后面，巨大的阴影一直往前延伸，不大功夫笼罩了“维多利亚号”；细微的沙尘如同水的飞沫一样轻盈地在空中飞舞。渐渐升高的沙潮缓缓地靠了过来……。\n 弗格森的双眼充满了活力，闪烁起希望的光芒。他喊道：\n “西蒙风！”\n “西蒙风！”乔摸不着头脑地跟着重复了一遍。\n “太好了！”肯尼迪绝望至极，狂怒地吼叫道，“太好了！我们就要完蛋了！”\n “不对！”博士反驳道，“恰恰相反，我们就要得救了！”\n 说完，弗格森急促地往吊篮外抛撒压重的沙子。他的同伴们终于明白了，连忙与博士共同干了起来。沙子卸完后，两人在博士旁占据好位置。\n “乔，现在把你的矿石给我扔掉50斤吧！”博士命令道。\n 乔毫不犹豫地执行了，不过脸上还是闪过一丝惋惜的神情。气球升了起来。\n “真险啊！”博士如释重负。\n 西蒙风确确实实闪电般迅速来到了。再晚一会儿，“维多利亚号”就会被风压扁，撕成碎片，甚至完全毁灭。巨大的龙卷风眼看要追上气球了，雹子般的沙雨劈头盖脸落下来。\n “再扔石头！”博士向乔叫道。\n “好嘞！”乔口里应着，抛出了一大块石英石。\n “维多利亚号”迅速升到龙卷风的上面，但是，立即被一股强大的气流裹住了。气球被强气流拖着，风驰电掣般地飞行在这片狂怒的沙海上空。\n 弗格森、肯尼迪和乔都不说话，他们注视着，期待着。这股旋风使三人感到了凉爽。\n 3点钟时， 风暴停息了，沙子纷纷落下，在地上形成无数个小沙丘。天空又恢复了最初的死寂。\n “维多利亚号”飞不动了。飘浮中，大家远远望见一个绿洲，绿树覆盖下的绿岛就耸立在这片沙的海洋中。\n “水，那儿有水！”博士喊了起来。\n 他立即打开大气球的阀门，放掉一些氢气。很快，“维多利亚号”轻轻地降落在了离绿洲约200步远的地方。\n 刚才的四个小时里，旅行家们竟飞了240英里的路。\n 吊篮很快被稳定住。肯尼迪和乔先后跳到了地面上。\n “你们带上枪！”博士吩咐道，“多加小心啊！”\n 狄克·肯尼迪匆匆忙忙回来拿了他的马枪，乔抓起一杆猎枪。他们俩快速奔向树林，转眼间钻了进去。清新的绿林使他们一眼就看出林中有丰富的水源。尽快找到水源的强烈欲望使他们放松了警惕，两人谁也没有留意自己重重的脚步声，更没注意到潮湿的地上到处留下的新鲜脚印。突然，在离他们20步远的地方响起了一声野兽的吼叫。\n “是狮子的叫声！”乔说。\n “太好了！”猎人豪气顿生，说：“我们来斗一斗吧！不拼搏不行的时候，人最有劲儿。”\n “当心呀，肯尼迪先生，当心！大家的安危就全靠您了。”\n 但是，肯尼迪根本没听乔在说些什么。他两眼冒火，手里端着马枪，勇敢地向前移动。在一棵棕榈树下，一只长着黑鬣的大狮子正摆着一付准备进攻的架式。它一看到猎人就扑了过来，但是还没等到爪子触地，它的心脏就挨了一枪。狮子倒在地上死了。\n “好棒哟！好棒哟！”乔叫了起来。\n 肯尼迪顾不了许多，他急匆匆奔向水井，踏着潮湿的台阶钻下去，一下子趴在清新的水源前。贪婪地喝了起来。乔也学着他的样子，趴下就喝。顿时，只听见动物饮水时发出的那种咂动舌头的声音。\n “咱们留神点，肯尼迪先生。”乔长出一口气说，“别喝得太多了！”\n 但是，肯尼迪只顾了喝，没有回答。他把头和双手都浸入这救命水中，完全陶醉了。\n “咦，弗格森先生呢？”乔问。\n 这个名字顿时使肯尼迪清醒了过来。他把随身带来的一个瓶子装满水，然后大步向井口台阶走去。\n 突然，他大吃了一惊：一个黑乎乎的庞大身躯堵住了井口！尾随狄克·肯尼迪身后的乔不觉倒退了几步。\n “我们被堵住了！”\n “不可能的事！你这是什么意思？……”\n 狄克·肯尼迪的话音未落，一声可怕的狮吼顿时使他明白了眼前发生的事。他又要对付一个新的对手了。\n “又一只雄师！”乔叫道。\n “不对，是一只母狮！哼！该死的畜生！你等着！”猎人边说，边急忙往马枪里装子弹。\n 顷刻间，猎人准备妥当。他砰地放了一枪，狮子不见了。\n “上！”他叫道。\n “不行，肯尼迪先生，不能上去。您没有一枪打死它，否则，它会掉到这里的。它现在肯定在上面等着呢。咱们俩谁第一个露出井面，它准会扑向谁。不用说，这个人也就完了！”\n “你说怎么办？反正得出去呀！再说，弗格森在等我们呢！”\n “咱们把狮子引出来。您拿着我的枪，把您的马枪给我。”\n “你打算怎么办？”\n “等会儿您就明白了。”\n 乔脱下自己的细布短上衣，用枪筒顶住。他把这当作诱饵举出了井口。狂怒的母狮见状，立即向短上衣扑了过来，肯尼迪趁狮子腾空之机开了一枪。子弹打中母狮的肩胛，狮子吼叫着，从台阶上滚下来，乔也被撞翻了。就在乔以为已经感觉到巨大的狮爪在向自己猛扑下来时，听到又一声枪响，紧接着，弗格森博士手拿着枪，出现在井口。枪口还在冒着烟呢。\n 乔连忙爬起身来，跨过死狮，把装满水的瓶子递给了主人。弗格森接过瓶子就往嘴里倒， 转眼功夫，半瓶水进了肚。此时，3位旅行家打心眼里感谢上帝那么及时地救了他们。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/305/513.html","bookId":166,"book":{"id":166,"title":"气球上的五星期 Five Weeks in a Balloon","description":"简介： Five Weeks in a Balloon, or, Journeys and Discoveries in Africa by Three Englishmen (French: Cinq semaines en ballon) is an adventure novel by Jules Verne.
