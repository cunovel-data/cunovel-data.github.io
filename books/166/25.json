The balloon rose to an elevation of five hundred feet, but it had scarcely changed its position to the westward in any perceptible degree.\\n\\n \"We are right in the open desert,\" said the doctor. \"Look at that vast reach of sand! What a strange spectacle! What a singular arrangement of nature! Why should there be, in one place, such extreme luxuriance of vegetation yonder, and here, this extreme aridity, and that in the same latitude, and under the same rays of the sun?\"\\n\\n \"The why concerns me but little,\" answered Kennedy, \"the reason interests me less than the fact. The thing is so; that\u0027s the important part of it!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, it is well to philosophize a little, Dick; it does no harm.\"\\n\\n \"Let us philosophize, then, if you will; we have time enough before us; we are hardly moving; the wind is afraid to blow; it sleeps.\"\\n\\n \"That will not last forever,\" put in Joe; \"I think I see some banks of clouds in the east.\"\\n\\n \"Joe\u0027s right!\" said the doctor, after he had taken a look.\\n\\n \"Good!\" said Kennedy; \"now for our clouds, with a fine rain, and a fresh wind to dash it into our faces!\"\\n\\n \"Well, we\u0027ll see, Dick, we\u0027ll see!\"\\n\\n \"But this is Friday, master, and I\u0027m afraid of Fridays!\"\\n\\n \"Well, I hope that this very day you\u0027ll get over those notions.\"\\n\\n \"I hope so, master, too. Whew!\" he added, mopping his face, \"heat\u0027s a good thing, especially in winter, but in summer it don\u0027t do to take too much of it.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you fear the effect of the sun\u0027s heat on our balloon?\" asked Kennedy, addressing the doctor.\\n\\n \"No! the gutta-percha coating resists much higher temperatures than even this. With my spiral I have subjected it inside to as much as one hundred and fifty-eight degrees sometimes, and the covering does not appear to have suffered.\"\\n\\n \"A cloud! a real cloud!\" shouted Joe at this moment, for that piercing eyesight of his beat all the glasses.\\n\\n And, in fact, a thick bank of vapor, now quite distinct, could be seen slowly emerging above the horizon. It appeared to be very deep, and, as it were, puffed out. It was, in reality, a conglomeration of smaller clouds. The latter invariably retained their original formation, and from this circumstance the doctor concluded that there was no current of air in their collected mass.\\n\\n This compact body of vapor had appeared about eight o\u0027clock in the morning, and, by eleven, it had already reached the height of the sun\u0027s disk. The latter then disappeared entirely behind the murky veil, and the lower belt of cloud, at the same moment, lifted above the line of the horizon, which was again disclosed in a full blaze of daylight.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s only an isolated cloud,\" remarked the doctor. \"It won\u0027t do to count much upon that.\"\\n\\n \"Look, Dick, its shape is just the same as when we saw it this morning!\"\\n\\n \"Then, doctor, there\u0027s to be neither rain nor wind, at least for us!\"\\n\\n \"I fear so; the cloud keeps at a great height.\"\\n\\n \"Well, doctor, suppose we were to go in pursuit of this cloud, since it refuses to burst upon us?\"\\n\\n \"I fancy that to do so wouldn\u0027t help us much; it would be a consumption of gas, and, consequently, of water, to little purpose; but, in our situation, we must not leave anything untried; therefore, let us ascend!\"\\n\\n And with this, the doctor put on a full head of flame from the cylinder, and the dilation of the hydrogen, occasioned by such sudden and intense heat, sent the balloon rapidly aloft.\\n\\n About fifteen hundred feet from the ground, it encountered an opaque mass of cloud, and entered a dense fog, suspended at that elevation; but it did not meet with the least breath of wind. This fog seemed even destitute of humidity, and the articles brought in contact with it were scarcely dampened in the slightest degree. The balloon, completely enveloped in the vapor, gained a little increase of speed, perhaps, and that was all.\\n\\n The doctor gloomily recognized what trifling success he had obtained from his manoeuvre, and was relapsing into deep meditation, when he heard Joe exclaim, in tones of most intense astonishment:\\n\\n \"Ah! by all that\u0027s beautiful!\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter, Joe?\"\\n\\n \"Doctor! Mr. Kennedy! Here\u0027s something curious!\"\\n\\n \"What is it, then?\"\\n\\n \"We are not alone, up here! There are rogues about! They\u0027ve stolen our invention!\"\\n\\n \"Has he gone crazy?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n Joe stood there, perfectly motionless, the very picture of amazement.\\n\\n \"Can the hot sun have really affected the poor fellow\u0027s brain?\" said the doctor, turning toward him.\\n\\n \"Will you tell me?--\"\\n\\n \"Look!\" said Joe, pointing to a certain quarter of the sky.\\n\\n \"By St. James!\" exclaimed Kennedy, in turn, \"why, who would have believed it? Look, look! doctor!\"\\n\\n \"I see it!\" said the doctor, very quietly.\\n\\n \"Another balloon! and other passengers, like ourselves!\"\\n\\n And, sure enough, there was another balloon about two hundred paces from them, floating in the air with its car and its aeronauts. It was following exactly the same route as the Victoria.\\n\\n \"Well,\" said the doctor, \"nothing remains for us but to make signals; take the flag, Kennedy, and show them our colors.\"\\n\\n It seemed that the travellers by the other balloon had just the same idea, at the same moment, for the same kind of flag repeated precisely the same salute with a hand that moved in just the same manner.\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\" asked Kennedy.\\n\\n \"They are apes,\" said Joe, \"imitating us.\"\\n\\n \"It means,\" said the doctor, laughing, \"that it is you, Dick, yourself, making that signal to yourself; or, in other words, that we see ourselves in the second balloon, which is no other than the Victoria.\"\\n\\n \"As to that, master, with all respect to you,\" said Joe, \"you\u0027ll never make me believe it.\"\\n\\n \"Climb up on the edge of the car, Joe; wave your arms, and then you\u0027ll see.\"\\n\\n Joe obeyed, and all his gestures were instantaneously and exactly repeated.\\n\\n \"It is merely the effect of the MIRAGE,\" said the doctor, \"and nothing else--a simple optical phenomenon due to the unequal refraction of light by different layers of the atmosphere, and that is all.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s wonderful,\" said Joe, who could not make up his mind to surrender, but went on repeating his gesticulations.\\n\\n \"What a curious sight! Do you know,\" said Kennedy, \"that it\u0027s a real pleasure to have a view of our noble balloon in that style? She\u0027s a beauty, isn\u0027t she?-- and how stately her movements as she sweeps along!\"\\n\\n \"You may explain the matter as you like,\" continued Joe, \"it\u0027s a strange thing, anyhow!\"\\n\\n But ere long this picture began to fade away; the clouds rose higher, leaving the balloon, which made no further attempt to follow them, and in about an hour they disappeared in the open sky.\\n\\n The wind, which had been scarcely perceptible, seemed still to diminish, and the doctor in perfect desperation descended toward the ground, and all three of the travellers, whom the incident just recorded had, for a few moments, diverted from their anxieties, relapsed into gloomy meditation, sweltering the while beneath the scorching heat.\\n\\n About four o\u0027clock, Joe descried some object standing out against the vast background of sand, and soon was able to declare positively that there were two palm-trees at no great distance.\\n\\n \"Palm-trees!\" exclaimed Ferguson; \"why, then there\u0027s a spring--a well!\"\\n\\n He took up his glass and satisfied himself that Joe\u0027s eyes had not been mistaken.\\n\\n \"At length!\" he said, over and over again, \"water! water! and we are saved; for if we do move slowly, still we move, and we shall arrive at last!\"\\n\\n \"Good, master! but suppose we were to drink a mouthful in the mean time, for this air is stifling?\"\\n\\n \"Let us drink then, my boy!\"\\n\\n No one waited to be coaxed. A whole pint was swallowed then and there, reducing the total remaining supply to three pints and a half.\\n\\n \"Ah! that does one good!\" said Joe; \"wasn\u0027t it fine? Barclay and Perkins never turned out ale equal to that!\"\\n\\n \"See the advantage of being put on short allowance!\" moralized the doctor.\\n\\n \"It is not great, after all,\" retorted Kennedy; \"and if I were never again to have the pleasure of drinking water, I should agree on condition that I should never be deprived of it.\"\\n\\n At six o\u0027clock the balloon was floating over the palm-trees.\\n\\n They were two shrivelled, stunted, dried-up specimens of trees--two ghosts of palms--without foliage, and more dead than alive. Ferguson examined them with terror.\\n\\n At their feet could be seen the half-worn stones of a spring, but these stones, pulverized by the baking heat of the sun, seemed to be nothing now but impalpable dust. There was not the slightest sign of moisture. The doctor\u0027s heart shrank within him, and he was about to communicate his thoughts to his companions, when their exclamations attracted his attention. As far as the eye could reach to the eastward, extended a long line of whitened bones; pieces of skeletons surrounded the fountain; a caravan had evidently made its way to that point, marking its progress by its bleaching remains; the weaker had fallen one by one upon the sand; the stronger, having at length reached this spring for which they panted, had there found a horrible death.\\n\\n Our travellers looked at each other and turned pale.\\n\\n \"Let us not alight!\" said Kennedy, \"let us fly from this hideous spectacle! There\u0027s not a drop of water here!\"\\n\\n \"No, Dick, as well pass the night here as elsewhere; let us have a clear conscience in the matter. We\u0027ll dig down to the very bottom of the well. There has been a spring here, and perhaps there\u0027s something left in it!\"\\n\\n The Victoria touched the ground; Joe and Kennedy put into the car a quantity of sand equal to their weight, and leaped out. They then hastened to the well, and penetrated to the interior by a flight of steps that was now nothing but dust. The spring appeared to have been dry for years. They dug down into a parched and powdery sand--the very dryest of all sand, indeed--there was not one trace of moisture!\\n\\n The doctor saw them come up to the surface of the desert, saturated with perspiration, worn out, covered with fine dust, exhausted, discouraged and despairing.\\n\\n He then comprehended that their search had been fruitless. He had expected as much, and he kept silent, for he felt that, from this moment forth, he must have courage and energy enough for three.\\n\\n Joe brought up with him some pieces of a leathern bottle that had grown hard and horn-like with age, and angrily flung them away among the bleaching bones of the caravan.\\n\\n At supper, not a word was spoken by our travellers, and they even ate without appetite. Yet they had not, up to this moment, endured the real agonies of thirst, and were in no desponding mood, excepting for the future.\\n\\n 谈点哲学——地平线上的云彩——云雾里——一只出乎意料的气球——信号——“维多利亚号”的精确映像——棕榈树——骆驼商队的踪迹——沙漠中的井\\n\\n 第二天，天空还是那么纯净，气流还是纹丝不动。“维多利亚号”一直上升到500尺的高度。它向西方飘去，但是速度慢得几乎难以觉察到是在移动。\\n\\n “我们现在是在沙漠中心地带了。”博士说，“瞧瞧这一望无际的沙漠吧！多么奇特的景观！大自然多么特殊的安排！在同样的纬度，同样的阳光下，为什么那边绿茵遍野，树木丛生，这儿却是黄沙连连，寸草不长？”\\n\\n “亲爱的弗格森，你的为什么，我倒不怎么担心。”肯尼迪答道，“我更关心事实。事情就是这样，这才是问题的关键。”\\n\\n “亲爱的肯尼迪，应该探讨点哲理，这么做没有害处。”\\n\\n “咱们探讨吧，我很愿意奉陪，反正现在有的是时间。我们差不多是在原地不动。风吓得不敢刮了，它睡着了。”\\n\\n “这种情况不会长久的。”乔说，“我好像看到东边有几长条云彩。”\\n\\n “乔说的对。”博士回答说。\\n\\n “好吧，”肯尼迪说，“我们能不能抓住这几块云？它们会不会给我们迎面送来我们需要的风和雨呢？”\\n\\n “我们等着瞧吧！肯尼迪，我们等着瞧。”\\n\\n “不过，今天是星期五呀，主人。我不相信星期五会有什么好事①。”\\n\\n ①星期五是耶稣受难日，所以欧洲人把这一天看作是不吉利的日子。\\n\\n “得了吧，你！我希望今天你能彻底消除你那满脑子的偏见。”\\n\\n “但愿吧，先生。”他擦着脸上的汗水说，“哇！热也是件好事，尤其是在冬天。但是夏天里，就不该热这么狠了。”\\n\\n “你就不怕这么毒的太阳烤坏了气球吗？”肯尼迪担心地问博士。\\n\\n “不怕的。涂刷塔夫绸的马来树胶能经受住比这高得多的温度。我把这种树胶涂在蛇形管内用火烤过。 有时温度高到华氏158度（70摄氏度）都没问题，而且气囊也没受什么影响。”\\n\\n “云彩！真是块云彩！”此时，乔大叫起来。他那锐利的目光胜过所有的望远镜。\\n\\n 的确，一长条厚厚的，清晰可见的云带在地平线上空慢慢升起。云块看上去颜色发暗，而且仿佛在逐渐膨大。那是一些聚集在一起而又各自保持原状的小块云。博士由此得出结论说， 在这块云团中，空气根本不流动。其实，这块云团在早上8点钟左右就出现了，只是到11点才够到了日轮，把太阳整个地遮在这块厚厚的云帘后面。就在云团的下沿离开地平线的一刹那间，那儿变得一片明亮。\\n\\n “只是一块孤单单的云。”博士说，“不要对它期望太高。肯尼迪，你瞧，云的形状仍然和早上一模一样。”\\n\\n “你说的还真不错，弗格森。那边既没下雨，也没刮风。看来，那块云起码不会给我们带来这两样东西。”\\n\\n “的确让人有些担心，因为它一直待在很高的地方。”\\n\\n “这样吧，弗格森！既然它不愿意在我们头上散开，我们是不是飞过去弄个明白？”\\n\\n “我认为这么做没有多大的用处，”博士答道，“而且会白白消耗一些气，特别是会浪费大量的水。不过，在我们现在的处境下，又不能忽视任何可能的机会。唔，好吧！我们就飞上去。”\\n\\n 说完，博士把氢氧喷嘴的火头拧大，加热了蛇形管。热度骤然升高，扩散开来。不大一会儿，在氢气膨胀的作用下，气球向上升去。\\n\\n 在离地约1500尺高的地方，“维多利亚号”一触到昏暗的云团，马上便被浓雾包围了。气球不再继续上升。但是，云雾里没有一丝风，甚至没有什么水分，吊篮里裸露在外的东西几乎没有被打湿。被围在这团气中的“维多利亚号”或许飞得快了一点，不过也就是这么多了。\\n\\n 看到这次行动没有什么成效，博士忧心忡忡。正在这时，他听见乔语气极为惊讶地叫道：\\n\\n “啊呀！怎么搞的！”\\n\\n “出什么事了，乔？”\\n\\n “主人，快来看哪！肯尼迪先生！简直太奇怪了！”\\n\\n “到底出什么事了？”\\n\\n “这儿不止我们三个，还有几个阴谋家呢！有人偷了我们的发明！”\\n\\n “他疯了吗？”肯尼迪问。\\n\\n 乔惊得呆呆地愣在那儿，一动不动，仿佛傻了一般。\\n\\n “是不是阳光把这个可怜的小伙子晒神经了。”博士边说，边把身子转向乔。\\n\\n “你要对我说……？”\\n\\n “先生，您瞧。”乔一边说，一边用手指着空间中的一个圆点。\\n\\n “我以圣人的名义发誓！”这一回，轮到肯尼迪叫嚷了，“这真不可思议！弗格森，弗格森！你看哪，看哪！”\\n\\n “我看见了。”博士沉着地说。\\n\\n “竟然还有一个气球！和我们一样，上面也有旅行家！”\\n\\n 果然， 在200尺之外的地方，有一个气球正飘荡在空中，气球下面也有一只吊篮，吊篮里面也乘着旅行家，而且气球飞的路线也与“维多利亚号”完全相同。\\n\\n “好吧！”博士说，“既然如此，我们只有给他们发个信号了。肯尼迪，拿旗帜来，给他们看看我们的国旗。”\\n\\n 另一个气球上的人似乎同时也产生了一样的想法，对方也有一个人摆着旗打招呼。令人吃惊的是，摇旗的动作，时间，旗帜的形状，甚至打招呼的方式全都一模一样。\\n\\n “这是什么意思？”猎人不解地问。\\n\\n “是些猴子。”乔猜测道，“它们在戏弄我们呢！”\\n\\n 看到这一切，弗格森恍然大悟，他笑着说：\\n\\n “亲爱的肯尼迪，你该清楚了，是你在给自己打信号呢。换句话说，另一只吊篮里的人就是我们。那个气球实实在在就是我们的‘维多利亚号’。”\\n\\n “噢？主人，对不起，说什么我也不会相信您的话。”\\n\\n “乔，你站到吊篮沿上去，摆摆手，就会明白了。”\\n\\n 乔立即照办。他看到自己的动作被对方同时一丝不差地重做了一遍。\\n\\n “不是别的，不过是一种幻影罢了。”博士解释说，“这是一种简单的光学现象，是由于大气层中空气的密度不同造成的，仅此而已。”\\n\\n “这太奇妙了！”乔不住地赞叹。他实在无法承认事实，心犹不甘地把两只手又轮流挥挥试了试。\\n\\n “多么稀奇的场面！”肯尼迪说，“看到我们勇敢的‘维多利亚号’，太让人高兴了！你们瞧，它的样子多可爱，多威风啊！”\\n\\n “按你们那种方式，再解释也没用。”乔执拗地说，“不管怎么说，这种效应就是奇怪嘛。”\\n\\n 时间不久，这种现象就逐渐模糊了，云又升高了许多，“维多利亚号”落在了它的下面，不过，博士并不想再去追它。一个小时后，云在天空中消失得无影无踪。\\n\\n 风几乎察觉不到，它仿佛仍在减弱。博士完全失望了，他把气球重新向地面靠近。\\n\\n 刚才的小插曲使旅行家们暂时忘掉了忧虑。随着气球下降，折磨人的高温又使他们难以忍受，3位旅行家又坠入忧郁的沉思中。\\n\\n 将近4点钟时， 乔隐约看到在无垠的沙漠上有一个凸起的物体。不大一会儿功夫，他认出来了，那是两棵相距不远的棕榈树，他立刻告诉了同伴。\\n\\n “棕榈树！”弗格森博士喊道，“可是，有泉眼和水井吗？”\\n\\n 他举起望远镜，望了望，证实乔的眼睛没看错。\\n\\n “终于有水了，有水了！”他反复地说，“我们得救了。尽管我们前进得不多，总归一直在前进。我们最终一定会到那儿的！”\\n\\n “那么，先生，我们是不是把原来剩的水喝掉？空气实在太闷热了。”乔请求道。\\n\\n “喝吧，小伙子。”\\n\\n 没有人再客气，整整1品脱水转眼就光了。现在，储备水只剩下3品脱半了。\\n\\n “啊！喝点水太美了！”乔感慨地说，“这水多好喝啊！就是‘帕金斯’啤酒也从没让我这么高兴过。”\\n\\n “这就是东西缺的好处。”博士回答说。\\n\\n “总之，这种好处可不怎么样。”猎人说，“我宁可从不享受喝水的快乐，只要不缺水喝也就够了。”\\n\\n 6点钟时，“维多利亚号”飘到了棕榈树上空。\\n\\n 这是两棵干枯、孱弱的病树，可以说是两棵枝叶全无的秃树精。与其说它们还活着，倒不如说死了更恰当。看到这一切，弗格森的心不由得一沉。\\n\\n 树脚下有口井。井台边被磨蚀的块块石头清晰可辨。可是，在似火骄阳的烘烤下，这些石头已变得非常疏松，好像很快就要化成尘埃似的。这儿连一点湿润的迹象也没有。弗格森的心里很痛苦，正当他要把忧虑告诉同伴时，肯尼迪和乔的惊呼声吸引了他的注意。\\n\\n 西面，堆堆白骨呈线状摆在地上，一眼望不到头，另外，还有许多骷髅倒在一个干枯泉眼的四周。看样子，有只骆驼商队曾深入到了这个地方。这长长的枯骨堆表明了他们来的路线。显然，旅途中，身体弱的一个个倒在黄沙上死去；身强力壮的终于坚持到了这个被寄予希望的水源前。但是，他们在这里找到的却是可怕的死亡。\\n\\n 旅行家们你看看我，我看看你，个个脸色苍白。\\n\\n “我们不降下去了，”肯尼迪说，“快离开吧，在这个可怕的地方一滴水也找不到的。”\\n\\n “不，肯尼迪，我们不离开，应该下去弄清楚，反正在这儿过夜和在别的地方没什么区别。既然这儿有过水源，我们可以把那口井挖到底看一看，也许还能剩点儿水。”\\n\\n “维多利亚号”着陆了。乔和肯尼迪往吊篮里装上和自己体重相等的沙子后，下了吊篮。他们奔到井前，顺着布满灰尘的阶梯下到了井底。水眼看上去早已干涸了多年，他们俩在干燥松软的沙中挖了半天，一无所获，下面连一点湿气都没有，最后，他们不得不放弃挖掘，回到地面上。\\n\\n 博士见他们汗流浃背，满身尘土，一个个疲惫不堪，垂头丧气的模样，就知道没找到水。其实，他已经预料到会是这个结果，所以什么也没说。他意识到，从这一刻起，他必须鼓起3个人的勇气和毅力。\\n\\n 乔气愤地把从井底带回的几片变硬了的羊皮袋碎片扔到地上散落的骸骨堆中。\\n\\n 晚饭时，3人谁也没说一句话。他们勉勉强强地吃完了这顿饭。\\n\\n 其实到目前为止，他们还没有真正体验过干渴的痛苦。现在，他们不过是为未来的命运担忧罢了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/305/511.html","bookId":166,"book":{"id":166,"title":"气球上的五星期 Five Weeks in a Balloon","description":"简介： Five Weeks in a Balloon, or, Journeys and Discoveries in Africa by Three Englishmen (French: Cinq semaines en ballon) is an adventure novel by Jules Verne.
