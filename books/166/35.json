What had become of Joe, while his master was thus vainly seeking for him? When he had dashed headlong into the lake, his first movement on coming to the surface was to raise his eyes and look upward. He saw the Victoria already risen far above the water, still rapidly ascending and growing smaller and smaller. It was soon caught in a rapid current and disappeared to the northward. His master--both his friends were saved! \"How lucky it was,\" thought he, \"that I had that idea to throw myself out into the lake! Mr. Kennedy would soon have jumped at it, and he would not have hesitated to do as I did, for nothing\u0027s more natural than for one man to give himself up to save two others. That\u0027s mathematics!\" Satisfied on this point, Joe began to think of himself. He was in the middle of a vast lake, surrounded by tribes unknown to him, and probably ferocious. All the greater reason why he should get out of the scrape by depending only on himself. And so he gave himself no farther concern about it. Before the attack by the birds of prey, which, according to him, had behaved like real condors, he had noticed an island on the horizon, and determining to reach it, if possible, he put forth all his knowledge and skill in the art of swimming, after having relieved himself of the most troublesome part of his clothing. The idea of a stretch of five or six miles by no means disconcerted him; and therefore, so long as he was in the open lake, he thought only of striking out straight ahead and manfully. In about an hour and a half the distance between him and the island had greatly diminished. But as he approached the land, a thought, at first fleeting and then tenacious, arose in his mind. He knew that the shores of the lake were frequented by huge alligators, and was well aware of the voracity of those monsters. Now, no matter how much he was inclined to find every thing in this world quite natural, the worthy fellow was no little disturbed by this reflection. He feared greatly lest white flesh like his might be particularly acceptable to the dreaded brutes, and advanced only with extreme precaution, his eyes on the alert on both sides and all around him. At length, he was not more than one hundred yards from a bank, covered with green trees, when a puff of air strongly impregnated with a musky odor reached him. \"There!\" said he to himself, \"just what I expected. The crocodile isn\u0027t far off!\" With this he dived swiftly, but not sufficiently so to avoid coming into contact with an enormous body, the scaly surface of which scratched him as he passed. He thought himself lost and swam with desperate energy. Then he rose again to the top of the water, took breath and dived once more. Thus passed a few minutes of unspeakable anguish, which all his philosophy could not overcome, for he thought, all the while, that he heard behind him the sound of those huge jaws ready to snap him up forever. In this state of mind he was striking out under the water as noiselessly as possible when he felt himself seized by the arm and then by the waist. Poor Joe! he gave one last thought to his master; and began to struggle with all the energy of despair, feeling himself the while drawn along, but not toward the bottom of the lake, as is the habit of the crocodile when about to devour its prey, but toward the surface. So soon as he could get breath and look around him, he saw that he was between two natives as black as ebony, who held him, with a firm gripe, and uttered strange cries. \"Ha!\" said Joe, \"blacks instead of crocodiles! Well, I prefer it as it is; but how in the mischief dare these fellows go in bathing in such places?\" Joe was not aware that the inhabitants of the islands of Lake Tchad, like many other negro tribes, plunge with impunity into sheets of water infested with crocodiles and caymans, and without troubling their heads about them. The amphibious denizens of this lake enjoy the well-deserved reputation of being quite inoffensive. But had not Joe escaped one peril only to fall into another? That was a question which he left events to decide; and, since he could not do otherwise, he allowed himself to be conducted to the shore without manifesting any alarm. \"Evidently,\" thought he, \"these chaps saw the Victoria skimming the waters of the lake, like a monster of the air. They were the distant witnesses of my tumble, and they can\u0027t fail to have some respect for a man that fell from the sky! Let them have their own way, then.\" Joe was at this stage of his meditations, when he was landed amid a yelling crowd of both sexes, and all ages and sizes, but not of all colors. In fine, he was surrounded by a tribe of Biddiomahs as black as jet. Nor had he to blush for the scantiness of his costume, for he saw that he was in \"undress\" in the highest style of that country. But before he had time to form an exact idea of the situation, there was no mistaking the agitation of which he instantly became the object, and this soon enabled him to pluck up courage, although the adventure of Kazah did come back rather vividly to his memory. \"I foresee that they are going to make a god of me again,\" thought he, \"some son of the moon most likely. Well, one trade\u0027s as good as another when a man has no choice. The main thing is to gain time. Should the Victoria pass this way again, I\u0027ll take advantage of my new position to treat my worshippers here to a miracle when I go sailing up into the sky!\" While Joe\u0027s thoughts were running thus, the throng pressed around him. They prostrated themselves before him; they howled; they felt him; they became even annoyingly familiar; but at the same time they had the consideration to offer him a superb banquet consisting of sour milk and rice pounded in honey. The worthy fellow, making the best of every thing, took one of the heartiest luncheons he ever ate in his life, and gave his new adorers an exalted idea of how the gods tuck away their food upon grand occasions. When evening came, the sorcerers of the island took him respectfully by the hand, and conducted him to a sort of house surrounded with talismans; but, as he was entering it, Joe cast an uneasy look at the heaps of human bones that lay scattered around this sanctuary. But he had still more time to think about them when he found himself at last shut up in the cabin. During the evening and through a part of the night, he heard festive chantings, the reverberations of a kind of drum, and a clatter of old iron, which were very sweet, no doubt, to African ears. Then there were howling choruses, accompanied by endless dances by gangs of natives who circled round and round the sacred hut with contortions and grimaces. Joe could catch the sound of this deafening orchestra, through the mud and reeds of which his cabin was built; and perhaps under other circumstances he might have been amused by these strange ceremonies; but his mind was soon disturbed by quite different and less agreeable reflections. Even looking at the bright side of things, he found it both stupid and sad to be left alone in the midst of this savage country and among these wild tribes. Few travellers who had penetrated to these regions had ever again seen their native land. Moreover, could he trust to the worship of which he saw himself the object? He had good reason to believe in the vanity of human greatness; and he asked himself whether, in this country, adoration did not sometimes go to the length of eating the object adored! But, notwithstanding this rather perplexing prospect, after some hours of meditation, fatigue got the better of his gloomy thoughts, and Joe fell into a profound slumber, which would have lasted no doubt until sunrise, had not a very unexpected sensation of dampness awakened the sleeper. Ere long this dampness became water, and that water gained so rapidly that it had soon mounted to Joe\u0027s waist. \"What can this be?\" said he; \"a flood! a water-spout! or a new torture invented by these blacks? Faith, though, I\u0027m not going to wait here till it\u0027s up to my neck!\" And, so saying, he burst through the frail wall with a jog of his powerful shoulder, and found himself--where? --in the open lake! Island there was none. It had sunk during the night. In its place, the watery immensity of Lake Tchad! \"A poor country for the land-owners!\" said Joe, once more vigorously resorting to his skill in the art of natation. One of those phenomena, which are by no means unusual on Lake Tchad, had liberated our brave Joe. More than one island, that previously seemed to have the solidity of rock, has been submerged in this way; and the people living along the shores of the mainland have had to pick up the unfortunate survivors of these terrible catastrophes. Joe knew nothing about this peculiarity of the region, but he was none the less ready to profit by it. He caught sight of a boat drifting about, without occupants, and was soon aboard of it. He found it to be but the trunk of a tree rudely hollowed out; but there were a couple of paddles in it, and Joe, availing himself of a rapid current, allowed his craft to float along. \"But let us see where we are,\" he said. \"The polar-star there, that does its work honorably in pointing out the direction due north to everybody else, will, most likely, do me that service.\" He discovered, with satisfaction, that the current was taking him toward the northern shore of the lake, and he allowed himself to glide with it. About two o\u0027clock in the morning he disembarked upon a promontory covered with prickly reeds, that proved very provoking and inconvenient even to a philosopher like him; but a tree grew there expressly to offer him a bed among its branches, and Joe climbed up into it for greater security, and there, without sleeping much, however, awaited the dawn of day. When morning had come with that suddenness which is peculiar to the equatorial regions, Joe cast a glance at the tree which had sheltered him during the last few hours, and beheld a sight that chilled the marrow in his bones. The branches of the tree were literally covered with snakes and chameleons! The foliage actually was hidden beneath their coils, so that the beholder might have fancied that he saw before him a new kind of tree that bore reptiles for its leaves and fruit. And all this horrible living mass writhed and twisted in the first rays of the morning sun! Joe experienced a keen sensation or terror mingled with disgust, as he looked at it, and he leaped precipitately from the tree amid the hissings of these new and unwelcome bedfellows. \"Now, there\u0027s something that I would never have believed!\" said he. He was not aware that Dr. Vogel\u0027s last letters had made known this singular feature of the shores of Lake Tchad, where reptiles are more numerous than in any other part of the world. But after what he had just seen, Joe determined to be more circumspect for the future; and, taking his bearings by the sun, he set off afoot toward the northeast, avoiding with the utmost care cabins, huts, hovels, and dens of every description, that might serve in any manner as a shelter for human beings. How often his gaze was turned upward to the sky! He hoped to catch a glimpse, each time, of the Victoria; and, although he looked vainly during all that long, fatiguing day of sore foot-travel, his confident reliance on his master remained undiminished. Great energy of character was needed to enable him thus to sustain the situation with philosophy. Hunger conspired with fatigue to crush him, for a man\u0027s system is not greatly restored and fortified by a diet of roots, the pith of plants, such as the Mele, or the fruit of the doum palm-tree; and yet, according to his own calculations, Joe was enabled to push on about twenty miles to the westward. His body bore in scores of places the marks of the thorns with which the lake-reeds, the acacias, the mimosas, and other wild shrubbery through which he had to force his way, are thickly studded; and his torn and bleeding feet rendered walking both painful and difficult. But at length he managed to react against all these sufferings; and when evening came again, he resolved to pass the night on the shores of Lake Tchad. There he had to endure the bites of myriads of insects --gnats, mosquitoes, ants half an inch long, literally covered the ground; and, in less than two hours, Joe had not a rag remaining of the garments that had covered him, the insects having devoured them! It was a terrible night, that did not yield our exhausted traveller an hour of sleep. During all this time the wild-boars and native buffaloes, reenforced by the ajoub--a very dangerous species of lamantine --carried on their ferocious revels in the bushes and under the waters of the lake, filling the night with a hideous concert. Joe dared scarcely breathe. Even his courage and coolness had hard work to bear up against so terrible a situation. At length, day came again, and Joe sprang to his feet precipitately; but judge of the loathing he felt when he saw what species of creature had shared his couch--a toad!--but a toad five inches in length, a monstrous, repulsive specimen of vermin that sat there staring at him with huge round eyes. Joe felt his stomach revolt at the sight, and, regaining a little strength from the intensity of his repugnance, he rushed at the top of his speed and plunged into the lake. This sudden bath somewhat allayed the pangs of the itching that tortured his whole body; and, chewing a few leaves, he set forth resolutely, again feeling an obstinate resolution in the act, for which he could hardly account even to his own mind. He no longer seemed to have entire control of his own acts, and, nevertheless, he felt within him a strength superior to despair. However, he began now to suffer terribly from hunger. His stomach, less resigned than he was, rebelled, and he was obliged to fasten a tendril of wild-vine tightly about his waist. Fortunately, he could quench his thirst at any moment, and, in recalling the sufferings he had undergone in the desert, he experienced comparative relief in his exemption from that other distressing want. \"What can have become of the Victoria?\" he wondered. \"The wind blows from the north, and she should be carried back by it toward the lake. No doubt the doctor has gone to work to right her balance, but yesterday would have given him time enough for that, so that may be to-day--but I must act just as if I was never to see him again. After all, if I only get to one of the large towns on the lake, I\u0027ll find myself no worse off than the travellers my master used to talk about. Why shouldn\u0027t I work my way out of the scrape as well as they did? Some of them got back home again. Come, then! the deuce! Cheer up, my boy!\" Thus talking to himself and walking on rapidly, Joe came right upon a horde of natives in the very depths of the forest, but he halted in time and was not seen by them. The negroes were busy poisoning arrows with the juice of the euphorbium--a piece of work deemed a great affair among these savage tribes, and carried on with a sort of ceremonial solemnity. Joe, entirely motionless and even holding his breath, was keeping himself concealed in a thicket, when, happening to raise his eyes, he saw through an opening in the foliage the welcome apparition of the balloon--the Victoria herself--moving toward the lake, at a height of only about one hundred feet above him. But he could not make himself heard; he dared not, could not make his friends even see him! Tears came to his eyes, not of grief but of thankfulness; his master was then seeking him; his master had not left him to perish! He would have to wait for the departure of the blacks; then he could quit his hiding-place and run toward the borders of Lake Tchad! But by this time the Victoria was disappearing in the distant sky. Joe still determined to wait for her; she would come back again, undoubtedly. She did, indeed, return, but farther to the eastward. Joe ran, gesticulated, shouted--but all in vain! A strong breeze was sweeping the balloon away with a speed that deprived him of all hope. For the first time, energy and confidence abandoned the heart of the unfortunate man. He saw that he was lost. He thought his master gone beyond all prospect of return. He dared no longer think; he would no longer reflect! Like a crazy man, his feet bleeding, his body cut and torn, he walked on during all that day and a part of the next night. He even dragged himself along, sometimes on his knees, sometimes with his hands. He saw the moment nigh when all his strength would fail, and nothing would be left to him but to sink upon the ground and die. Thus working his way along, he at length found himself close to a marsh, or what he knew would soon become a marsh, for night had set in some hours before, and he fell by a sudden misstep into a thick, clinging mire. In spite of all his efforts, in spite of his desperate struggles, he felt himself sinking gradually in the swampy ooze, and in a few minutes he was buried to his waist. \"Here, then, at last, is death!\" he thought, in agony, \"and what a death!\" He now began to struggle again, like a madman; but his efforts only served to bury him deeper in the tomb that the poor doomed lad was hollowing for himself; not a log of wood or a branch to buoy him up; not a reed to which he might cling! He felt that all was over! His eyes convulsively closed! \"Master! master!--Help!\" were his last words; but his voice, despairing, unaided, half stifled already by the rising mire, died away feebly on the night. 乔的故事——住着比迪奥玛人的岛——崇拜——岛遭水淹——湖岸——“蛇树”——徒步旅行——遭受苦难——蚊子和蚂蚁——饥饿——“维多利亚号”飞来了——“维多利亚号”消失了——失望——沼泽——最后的呼喊 在弗格森博士徒劳地寻找乔的时候，乔的命运如何呢？ 乔跳进湖里后钻出水面的第一个动作就是仰脸朝天上望。他看见“维多利亚号”已经在湖的上空升起很高，而且还在迅速上升，同时一点点地变小，最后很快被一股较强气流包住，向北方移动，消失了。他的主人和朋友得救了。 “幸亏我想到了跳乍得湖这个办法。”他暗暗说，“要是肯尼迪先生也起了这个念头的话，肯定他也会毫不犹豫地像我这样做的，因为，一个人牺牲自己救其他两人的性命十分正常，这是肯定的。” 确信没做错后，乔开始考虑自己的处境。他现在是在一个广阔的大湖中，周围岛上、岸边住的全是些陌生的当地人。他们可能很凶残，因此，要想摆脱困境，只能自己靠自己。虽然如此，他其实并不怎么害怕。 乔认为遭到像胡兀鹫这样真正的猛禽攻击是很正常的。在此之前，他就发现地平线上有个岛，他决定往那儿游。于是，他脱去几件碍手碍脚的衣服后，开始施展出全部的游泳本领。游上五、六英里的路程对他来说几乎不费劲。既然是在湖里，他就只想着用力地游，别游斜了。 一个半小时后，他与小岛的距离已大大缩短。但是，随着小岛越来越近，他却越来越想逃离小岛。最初，这种念头只是闪了一下，而后便在他头脑中牢牢盘旋。他知道沿湖一带常常有凯门鳄出没，而且也对这种动物的贪婪一清二楚。即使这位诚实的小伙子认为世界上的事都是十分自然的，这时，他也不由地感到了不安。他害怕白人的肉特别合鳄鱼的胃口。于是，他目光警觉备加小心地往前游。就在他离绿树成荫的岸边只有几乎不到200米远的时候，一股强烈的麝香气味直冲他的鼻子。 “好嘛！我怕的就是这个！显然，凯门鳄就在附近。” 想到此，他急忙下潜，但还是没能及时避开。他感到一个巨大的物体从他身旁划过，一种鱼鳞般的硬皮擦了他一下。乔以为自己要没命了，于是他绝望地拼命游了起来。他浮出水面，换了口气，马上又潜入水中。尽管他明理超脱，此时却无法克服内心的那种难以言喻的恐慌。他就这样在水下度过了一刻钟的光景。后来，他似乎听到身后传来这种凶恶的家伙张开血盆大口的声音，好像正准备一口咬住他，于是他尽可能地轻手轻脚分开水流向前游去。突然，他觉得自己的一条胳膊被抓住了，随后又被什么拦腰抱住。 可怜的乔！他最后一次想到了主人，接着就绝望地死命挣扎起来。慢慢地，他感到有些不大对劲。鳄鱼吞吃俘获物时的习惯是把猎物往湖底拖，而自己不仅没有被往下拽，相反却被往湖面上拉。 乔刚一能呼吸，就立即睁开了眼睛。他发现自己面前竟是两名黑的像煤炭一样的黑人。他俩用力地抓着他，嘴里发出奇怪的喊叫声。 “啊！”乔情不自禁地叫了起来，“原来是黑人，不是鳄鱼！不错！还是这样好，总比喂鳄鱼强！哦，这些黑家伙怎么敢在这一带游泳？！” 他哪里知道，住在乍得湖中小岛上的居民和沿岸的许多黑人一样，总是满不在乎地在凯门鳄云集的湖水中钻来钻去。他们从没受过伤害，也不考虑是否有鳄鱼，因为，这个湖里的两栖动物一直被认为是不伤人的蜥蜴科动物。 可是，难道说，乔只有落入黑人手里才算避开了危险吗？当然不是，乔心里很清楚这点。不过，现在只有走一步说一步了。再者，既然眼下他干不了别的，就只好不露惧色地任由黑人一直把他带到岸上。 “显而易见，这些人看到了‘维多利亚号’像个怪物似的掠过湖面。”乔自忖，“他们肯定是眼瞅着我从空中跳了下来，所以，他们不会不敬重一位从天而降的人。我倒要看看他们会干些什么！” 当乔上了岸被乱叫乱嚷的人群围住时，他心里还在想着这些事。这群人中男女老幼什么年龄的都有。但是他们的皮肤颜色却只有一种，那就是黑色。原来，他到了比迪奥玛人的一个部落。这个种族的人很黑，却很漂亮。乔甚至不必为自己袒胸露背的模样脸红。他这种几乎全裸的打扮正是当地最时髦的。 乔还没有弄清楚怎么回事，就已经看出自己成了崇拜的对象。尽管他马上想到了在卡泽赫发生过的事，但这并不能让他安下心来。 “我预料我又要当神仙或当月亮神的儿子了。管他是什么神呢！算了，既然没法选择， 干这一行， 还是干别的，都是一码事。现在最重要的是争取时间。万一‘维多利亚号’又回来了，我就利用眼下新的身份上演一出神仙升天的好戏，给我的崇拜者们看看。” 就在乔想入非非的时候，周围的人群向他靠拢过来，越挤越密。他们单头哈腰，一付讨好相，嘴里还不停地叫嚷着，这个伸手碰碰乔的身子，那个触一触乔的衣服，个个显得很亲切。他们没忘记给乔献上一份丰盛的供品。有酸奶，还有一种用碾碎的米掺上蜂蜜做的食品。真诚的小伙子对什么都能泰然处之。他风扫残云般地把东西吃了个一干二净。这顿饭也算是他一生中吃过的最好的一顿了。他吃饭的样子让他的崇拜者们产生了一种看法，以为神仙们在重要场合下就是这么狼吞虎咽地进餐的呢。 傍晚时分，岛上的巫师们毕恭毕敬地搀着乔的手，把他领到了一幢四周摆着避邪物的茅屋里。走进这座神庙前，乔不安地瞥见房子一圈堆积着大量的白骨。当他被独自关在这幢屋子里后，他有时间好好考虑考虑他的处境了。 从天黑到深夜，乔听到茅屋外不停地响着狂欢的歌声，一种鼓的拍打声和铁器的敲击声。在非洲人听起来，这些声音非常悦耳。他门狼嚎一般地齐声唱着，围着这幢神圣的草房跳个不停，又是扭身子，又是扮鬼脸。 透过这道用泥巴和芦苇糊起的墙，乔可以真切地感受到这种震耳欲聋的喧嚣。如果在另外一种情况下，他会对这种奇怪的仪式怀有相当浓厚的兴趣。不过现在，他的脑子里萦绕着一种郁闷的思绪，对外面的吵闹厌烦透了。尽管看事情要从它好的一面看，但流落在这个野蛮的地区，身处这些土人中间，乔总觉得自己愚蠢，甚至悲哀。以前敢冒险到这些地方来的旅行家，很少有人能安安全全重返故里的。再说，他能相信自己会被一直崇拜下去吗？他有充分的理由相信人间的荣华富贵都是虚无缥缈的。他自忖，在这个地方黑人的崇拜会不会到了把崇拜物吃掉的程度？ 乔苦苦想了几个钟头，尽管前景不容乐观，但身心的疲倦战胜了思想的悲观。于是，他便倒头呼呼大睡。如果不是他突然感到身下潮湿，这一觉也许会睡到天光大亮。醒后不久他发现，才一会儿的功夫，潮湿变成了水，而且水在慢慢上涨，乔的半个身子都泡进了水里。 “这是怎么回事？”他自言自语地说，“发大水了？龙卷风？还是那些黑人折磨人的一种新花样？管它呢，反正我不能等着水淹死我！” 说着，他一膀子撞破芦苇墙，钻了出来。他这是在哪儿？周围大水茫茫，他是在湖里！小岛已经没了踪影！原来，夜里小岛被水淹没了。昨天还是小岛的地方，现在看到的只是一望无际的湖水。 “对那些地产主来说，可真不是个好地方！”乔心里想。他又生龙活虎地施展出他那有用技艺。 乍得湖里频频出现的这种现象使乔获得了自由。不止一个岛，看上去似乎像岩石一样坚固，但一夜之间就消失了，所以，沿岸的居民想必经常收留从这种可怕的灾难中死里逃生的不幸者。 乔对当地的这种特殊情况毫不知晓。不过他恰当地利用了这个天赐良机。他发现水上漂着一条小船，立即迅速爬了上去。这是当地人常用的独木舟。一截树干，中间部分大致挖空就成了，做工非常粗糙。船上正好有一对短桨。于是，乔便顺着一股激流漂下去。 “咱们来辨一下方向吧。”他自言自语地说，“北极星做事总是很诚实。它给每个人指明向北去的路，当然也很愿意帮我的忙。” 他满意地发现，水流正把他冲向乍得湖的北岸。他也就乐得顺其自然了。夜里2点钟左右， 他踏上了湖的一个岬角。这里遍地长着一种看上去非常讨厌人的带刺芦苇。再想得开的人也不会喜欢这种东西。好在旁边有棵大树，就像故意长些树枝给他当床用似的。为安全起见，乔爬上了树。他睡意朦胧地待在树杈上等候天亮。 赤道地区的早晨和其他地区不一样，天说亮就亮，一点不拖泥带水。乔趁天刚放亮，打量了一眼他晚间藏身的这棵树。一幅完全出乎意料的景象顿时使他毛骨悚然。树枝上简直密密麻麻爬满了蛇和变色龙，连树叶都快被遮掩得看不见了，好像这是一个新品种的树，专门产爬行动物似的。在一束阳光的照耀下，它们纷纷蠕动和盘曲回绕起来。乔既害怕又恶心，在这群爬虫的咝咝声中，一纵身跳到地上去了。 “这件事真让人不敢相信。”他心有余悸地说。 他不知道，弗格尔博士在他的最后几封信中已经谈到了乍得湖沿岸的这种特殊现象。这一地区的爬行动物比世界上其他任何地区都多。经历了这件事后，乔决定以后更加谨慎些。他根据太阳辨别了一下方向，就动身朝东北走去。一路上，他万分小心地避开土人的草屋、芦棚、土房等所有可能用来住人的建筑。 他一次又一次地仰望空中，希望能看见“维多利亚号”。整整一天，他边走边找，一直没有见着气球的影子。可是，这并没削弱他对主人的信任。对乔来说，需要有坚强的毅力才能豁达地看待自己的处境。他又累又饿，要知道，靠草根、小灌木汁以及“梅雷”、椰子充饥是不能使一个人恢复体力的。尽管如此，他估计着他还是向西走了30英里左右。他全身上下20多个地方被划得皮开肉绽，因为湖边到处都是带刺的芦苇、刺槐和含羞草。他的双脚被扎得鲜血淋淋，走起路来钻心的疼痛。可是，他毕竟忍受住了这些苦难，直到天黑，才决定在乍得湖岸边过夜。 不过夜里，他又不得不经受无数昆虫的无情叮咬，苍蝇、蚊子、长达半英寸的大蚂蚁简直漫天铺地。 2个小时后，乔身上掩体的很少几件衣服，连块碎片布也没剩下，全被昆虫吃掉了！这一夜成了痛苦难熬的一夜。这位疲惫不堪的旅行家连一分钟也没能捞着睡。而且一个晚上，灌木丛中野猪、野牛窜来窜去，不住地发威；湖水里，“阿蠕”，一种相当危险的海牛类动物狂怒不已。黑暗中，野兽的叫声此起彼伏，无休无止，乔动也不敢动。虽然他的忍耐性好，胆子大，可是这会儿也难以抵御得住这种恐怖的场面了。 天终于亮了。乔匆忙站起身来。这时，他发现自己居然与一个那么令人讨厌的家伙共同度过了一夜， 顿时觉得恶心死了。原来是一只癞蛤蟆！这只癞蛤蟆有5寸长短，畸形的头极端丑陋。它瞪着一双圆圆的大眼，瞧着乔。乔感到自己就要呕吐了。他连忙打起几分精神，抑制住厌恶，大步跑到湖边跳了进去。洗个澡后，折腾着他全身的刺痒才算稍微好了一点。在咀嚼了几片树叶以后，他又顽强执着地上路了。这种顽强和执着，连他也无法说清楚。他已经麻木，感觉不到自己是在走路。不过，他能体会到一种战胜绝望的精神力量。 这时，极度饥饿又开始折磨他。他的胃可不像他那么能忍耐，咕咕噜噜一个劲地抱怨。他只好扯一根藤蔓把肚子使劲勒住。好在渴不着，到处都可以找到水喝。想起在沙漠里遭受的罪，他觉得不受干渴的折磨，实在是件幸事。 “‘维多利亚号’会在哪儿呢？”他翻来覆去地自忖……“风是从北边刮过来的！照理说，气球应该回到湖上来！弗格森先生想必要弄新的装置把气球搞平衡。这项工作昨天一个白天应该够了，因此，不可能今天……。不过，我不能光指望这个，该怎么干的还得怎么干。总之，要是我能走到沿湖的哪个城市的话，我也会和主人说过的那些旅行家当时的情况一样，为什么我就不能像他们似的摆脱困境？他们不是有人从那儿回去了吗？管它呢！……来吧！勇敢点！” 勇敢的乔在树林里如此这般地自顾自说着，不过脚步一直没有停下来。正走着，他突然发现自己前后左右都是野人。他及时停下脚步躲了起来，总算没被看见。这些黑人正忙着用大戟植物的毒汁浸涂他们的箭头。这是当地土著人的重要事项，所以干的时候要同时举行一种隆重的仪式。 乔屏住呼吸，一动不动地藏在一簇矮村从中。偶然间，他仰了仰脸。透过树叶的缝隙，他突然看见了“维多利亚号”，真真切切是“维多利亚号”。它正在他的头顶上方几乎不到100尺的空中， 正朝着乍得湖方向飞去。乔在目前这种状况下，既不能喊叫，也不能现出身来，只好眼巴巴地望着气球。 他的眼里噙着泪水。不是因为失望，而是因为感激。他心中清楚，主人正在找他！主人没有舍弃他！他不得不一直等到黑人离去。之后他走出藏身地，便向乍得湖边奔去。但是，“维多利亚号”此时已越来越远，最后消失在天际中。乔决定等着气球。它肯定会回来的。果然，“维多利亚号”回来了。但是，它更靠东边。乔向东跑去，挥动着双手，嘴里拼命喊叫……。一切努力都白费了！一股大风正以无法遏止的速度带着气球飞呢。 不幸的乔第一次感到了软弱和绝望。他觉得，这一次自己没希望了，主人肯定是一去不复返。他不敢，也不愿意再想下去。他像个疯子一样，双脚鲜血淋淋，身上青一块紫一块，拼命地往前走——。整整一个白天过去了，夜幕已降临，他仍没有停下来。他步履艰难，时而跪着走，时而用手爬。他意识到力气就要用尽，死亡的时刻就要来临了——。 可怜的乔就这样一点点前进着，终于到了一个沼泽地前。起码说，他当时不知道，因为几个小时前天就黑了，前边什么也看不见。他突然跌入粘性很强的烂泥中。尽管他使出平生的力气，绝望地挣扎着想摆脱出来，但是，无济于事。他感到自己在一点点地陷入这块淤泥地里。几分钟后，他的半个身子已经沉下去了。 “这回真要死了！唉，这是个什么死法！——。”他痛苦地自忖。 这位不幸的人狂怒地挣扎，但这只能使他在这块自掘的墓穴里越陷越深。周围没有一截树可以拦住他，没有一根芦苇可让他抓住！他明白这一下完了！他闭上了双眼——。 “主人！主人！救救我！——。”他呼喊道。 但是，这绝望、孤独，已经很微弱的呼喊声在黑夜中消失了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/305/521.html","bookId":166,"book":{"id":166,"title":"气球上的五星期 Five Weeks in a Balloon","description":"简介： Five Weeks in a
