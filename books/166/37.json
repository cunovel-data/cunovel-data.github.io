{"id":4787,"no":37,"title":"Chapter 37","content":"The Western Route.--Joe wakes up.--His Obstinacy.--End of Joe\u0027s Narrative.--Tagelei.--Kennedy\u0027s Anxieties.--The Route to the North.--A Night near Aghades.\\n\\n During the night the wind lulled as though reposing after the boisterousness of the day, and the Victoria remained quietly at the top of the tall sycamore. The doctor and Kennedy kept watch by turns, and Joe availed himself of the chance to sleep most sturdily for twenty-four hours at a stretch.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the remedy he needs,\" said Dr. Ferguson. \"Nature will take charge of his care.\"\\n\\n With the dawn the wind sprang up again in quite strong, and moreover capricious gusts. It shifted abruptly from south to north, but finally the Victoria was carried away by it toward the west.\\n\\n The doctor, map in hand, recognized the kingdom of Damerghou, an undulating region of great fertility, in which the huts that compose the villages are constructed of long reeds interwoven with branches of the asclepia. The grain-mills were seen raised in the cultivated fields, upon small scaffoldings or platforms, to keep them out of the reach of the mice and the huge ants of that country.\\n\\n They soon passed the town of Zinder, recognized by its spacious place of execution, in the centre of which stands the \"tree of death.\" At its foot the executioner stands waiting, and whoever passes beneath its shadow is immediately hung!\\n\\n Upon consulting his compass, Kennedy could not refrain from saying:\\n\\n \"Look! we are again moving northward.\"\\n\\n \"No matter; if it only takes us to Timbuctoo, we shall not complain. Never was a finer voyage accomplished under better circumstances!\"\\n\\n \"Nor in better health,\" said Joe, at that instant thrusting his jolly countenance from between the curtains of the awning.\\n\\n \"There he is! there\u0027s our gallant friend--our preserver!\" exclaimed Kennedy, cordially.--\"How goes it, Joe?\"\\n\\n \"Oh! why, naturally enough, Mr. Kennedy, very naturally! I never felt better in my life! Nothing sets a man up like a little pleasure-trip with a bath in Lake Tchad to start on--eh, doctor?\"\\n\\n \"Brave fellow!\" said Ferguson, pressing Joe\u0027s hand, \"what terrible anxiety you caused us!\"\\n\\n \"Humph! and you, sir? Do you think that I felt easy in my mind about you, gentlemen? You gave me a fine fright, let me tell you!\"\\n\\n \"We shall never agree in the world, Joe, if you take things in that style.\"\\n\\n \"I see that his tumble hasn\u0027t changed him a bit,\" added Kennedy.\\n\\n \"Your devotion and self-forgetfulness were sublime, my brave lad, and they saved us, for the Victoria was falling into the lake, and, once there, nobody could have extricated her.\"\\n\\n \"But, if my devotion, as you are pleased to call my summerset, saved you, did it not save me too, for here we are, all three of us, in first-rate health? Consequently we have nothing to squabble about in the whole affair.\"\\n\\n \"Oh! we can never come to a settlement with that youth,\" said the sportsman.\\n\\n \"The best way to settle it,\" replied Joe, \"is to say nothing more about the matter. What\u0027s done is done. Good or bad, we can\u0027t take it back.\"\\n\\n \"You obstinate fellow!\" said the doctor, laughing; \"you can\u0027t refuse, though, to tell us your adventures, at all events.\"\\n\\n \"Not if you think it worth while. But, in the first place, I\u0027m going to cook this fat goose to a turn, for I see that Mr. Kennedy has not wasted his time.\"\\n\\n \"All right, Joe!\"\\n\\n \"Well, let us see then how this African game will sit on a European stomach!\"\\n\\n The goose was soon roasted by the flame of the blow-pipe, and not long afterward was comfortably stowed away. Joe took his own good share, like a man who had eaten nothing for several days. After the tea and the punch, he acquainted his friends with his recent adventures. He spoke with some emotion, even while looking at things with his usual philosophy. The doctor could not refrain from frequently pressing his hand when he saw his worthy servant more considerate of his master\u0027s safety than of his own, and, in relation to the sinking of the island of the Biddiomahs, he explained to him the frequency of this phenomenon upon Lake Tchad.\\n\\n At length Joe, continuing his recital, arrived at the point where, sinking in the swamp, he had uttered a last cry of despair.\\n\\n \"I thought I was gone,\" said he, \"and as you came right into my mind, I made a hard fight for it. How, I couldn\u0027t tell you--but I\u0027d made up my mind that I wouldn\u0027t go under without knowing why. Just then, I saw--two or three feet from me--what do you think? the end of a rope that had been fresh cut; so I took leave to make another jerk, and, by hook or by crook, I got to the rope. When I pulled, it didn\u0027t give; so I pulled again and hauled away and there I was on dry ground! At the end of the rope, I found an anchor! Ah, master, I\u0027ve a right to call that the anchor of safety, anyhow, if you have no objection. I knew it again! It was the anchor of the Victoria! You had grounded there! So I followed the direction of the rope and that gave me your direction, and, after trying hard a few times more, I got out of the swamp. I had got my strength back with my spunk, and I walked on part of the night away from the lake, until I got to the edge of a very big wood. There I saw a fenced-in place, where some horses were grazing, without thinking of any harm. Now, there are times when everybody knows how to ride a horse, are there not, doctor? So I didn\u0027t spend much time thinking about it, but jumped right on the back of one of those innocent animals and away we went galloping north as fast as our legs could carry us. I needn\u0027t tell you about the towns that I didn\u0027t see nor the villages that I took good care to go around. No! I crossed the ploughed fields; I leaped the hedges; I scrambled over the fences; I dug my heels into my nag; I thrashed him; I fairly lifted the poor fellow off his feet! At last I got to the end of the tilled land. Good! There was the desert. \u0027That suits me!\u0027 said I, \u0027for I can see better ahead of me and farther too.\u0027 I was hoping all the time to see the balloon tacking about and waiting for me. But not a bit of it; and so, in about three hours, I go plump, like a fool, into a camp of Arabs! Whew! what a hunt that was! You see, Mr. Kennedy, a hunter don\u0027t know what a real hunt is until he\u0027s been hunted himself! Still I advise him not to try it if he can keep out of it! My horse was so tired, he was ready to drop off his legs; they were close on me; I threw myself to the ground; then I jumped up again behind an Arab! I didn\u0027t mean the fellow any harm, and I hope he has no grudge against me for choking him, but I saw you--and you know the rest. The Victoria came on at my heels, and you caught me up flying, as a circus-rider does a ring. Wasn\u0027t I right in counting on you? Now, doctor, you see how simple all that was! Nothing more natural in the world! I\u0027m ready to begin over again, if it would be of any service to you. And besides, master, as I said a while ago, it\u0027s not worth mentioning.\"\\n\\n \"My noble, gallant Joe!\" said the doctor, with great feeling. \"Heart of gold! we were not astray in trusting to your intelligence and skill.\"\\n\\n \"Poh! doctor, one has only just to follow things along as they happen, and he can always work his way out of a scrape! The safest plan, you see, is to take matters as they come.\"\\n\\n While Joe was telling his experience, the balloon had rapidly passed over a long reach of country, and Kennedy soon pointed out on the horizon a collection of structures that looked like a town. The doctor glanced at his map and recognized the place as the large village of Tagelei, in the Damerghou country.\\n\\n \"Here,\" said he, \"we come upon Dr. Barth\u0027s route. It was at this place that he parted from his companions, Richardson and Overweg; the first was to follow the Zinder route, and the second that of Maradi; and you may remember that, of these three travellers, Barth was the only one who ever returned to Europe.\"\\n\\n \"Then,\" said Kennedy, following out on the map the direction of the Victoria, \"we are going due north.\"\\n\\n \"Due north, Dick.\"\\n\\n \"And don\u0027t that give you a little uneasiness?\"\\n\\n \"Why should it?\"\\n\\n \"Because that line leads to Tripoli, and over the Great Desert.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, we shall not go so far as that, my friend--at least, I hope not.\"\\n\\n \"But where do you expect to halt?\"\\n\\n \"Come, Dick, don\u0027t you feel some curiosity to see Timbuctoo?\"\\n\\n \"Timbuctoo?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly,\" said Joe; \"nobody nowadays can think of making the trip to Africa without going to see Timbuctoo.\"\\n\\n \"You will be only the fifth or sixth European who has ever set eyes on that mysterious city.\"\\n\\n \"Ho, then, for Timbuctoo!\"\\n\\n \"Well, then, let us try to get as far as between the seventeenth and eighteenth degrees of north latitude, and there we will seek a favorable wind to carry us westward.\"\\n\\n \"Good!\" said the hunter. \"But have we still far to go to the northward?\"\\n\\n \"One hundred and fifty miles at least.\"\\n\\n \"In that case,\" said Kennedy, \"I\u0027ll turn in and sleep a bit.\"\\n\\n \"Sleep, sir; sleep!\" urged Joe. \"And you, doctor, do the same yourself: you must have need of rest, for I made you keep watch a little out of time.\"\\n\\n The sportsman stretched himself under the awning; but Ferguson, who was not easily conquered by fatigue, remained at his post.\\n\\n In about three hours the Victoria was crossing with extreme rapidity an expanse of stony country, with ranges of lofty, naked mountains of granitic formation at the base. A few isolated peaks attained the height of even four thousand feet. Giraffes, antelopes, and ostriches were seen running and bounding with marvellous agility in the midst of forests of acacias, mimosas, souahs, and date-trees. After the barrenness of the desert, vegetation was now resuming its empire. This was the country of the Kailouas, who veil their faces with a bandage of cotton, like their dangerous neighbors, the Touaregs.\\n\\n At ten o\u0027clock in the evening, after a splendid trip of two hundred and fifty miles, the Victoria halted over an important town. The moonlight revealed glimpses of one district half in ruins; and some pinnacles of mosques and minarets shot up here and there, glistening in the silvery rays. The doctor took a stellar observation, and discovered that he was in the latitude of Aghades.\\n\\n This city, once the seat of an immense trade, was already falling into ruin when Dr. Barth visited it.\\n\\n The Victoria, not being seen in the obscurity of night, descended about two miles above Aghades, in a field of millet. The night was calm, and began to break into dawn about three o\u0027clock A.M.; while a light wind coaxed the balloon westward, and even a little toward the south.\\n\\n Dr. Ferguson hastened to avail himself of such good fortune, and rapidly ascending resumed his aerial journey amid a long wake of golden morning sunshine.\\n\\n 往西的旅程——乔醒了——乔的执拗——乔的个人历险记——塔热莱尔——肯尼迪的不安——向北飞——阿加德兹①附近的一夜\\n\\n ①尼日尔中部阿加德兹省省会，几乎全部处在撒哈拉大沙漠里。\\n\\n 夜里，风势从白天的狂暴中缓和下来，最后停止了。“维多利亚号”的锚勾住一棵硕大的西克莫无花果树树顶，气球稳稳当当地停在空中。博士和肯尼迪轮流值班，乔放心大胆地睡了整整一天一夜。\\n\\n “他需要吃的药，就是这个。让大自然来治好他的病吧。”弗格森说。\\n\\n 天亮时，风力又加大了，但是，风向却变化不定，一会儿突然转南风，一会儿又骤然变北风，最后，“维多利亚号”终于往西飞去。\\n\\n 博士手里拿着地图，辨认出他们是在达迈古王国上空。这儿的地势起伏不定，但土地极为肥沃。村里的茅屋都是用长长的芦苇与马利筋树的树枝混合一起做成的。耕田里，一个个小小的支架上，高高地堆放着打好的粮食。这些支架显然是用来保护粮食不遭田鼠和白蚁糟蹋的。\\n\\n 3位旅行家很快到了津德尔城②上空。 从那宽广的刑场很容易认出它来。刑场中间高耸着一棵“死亡之树”。刽子手就守在树下。凡从树荫下经过的人，不管他是谁，都要被立即吊死！\\n\\n ②尼日尔津德尔省省会，为全国第二大城市\\n\\n 肯尼迪查看了一下罗盘，忍不住地说：\\n\\n “哎呀！我们又向北飞了！”\\n\\n “这有什么关系？即使风把我们带到延巴克图，我也没有什么意见！还从来没有过这么自在地完成美妙的旅行的呢！……”\\n\\n “也没有身体这么健康地结束旅行的。”乔插话道。他那欢快的面孔从帐篷里露了出来。\\n\\n “呵！瞧我们勇敢的朋友！”猎人嚷道，“我们的救命恩人！怎么样？你还好吗？”\\n\\n “那当然了。我很好！肯尼迪先生。我还从来没觉得这么好过。一个人跳到乍得湖洗个澡，然后，再作一趟愉快的短途旅行，再也没有比这更让你觉得合适了！主人，不是吗？”\\n\\n “好样的，小伙子！”弗格森紧紧握着他的手夸奖道，“你让我们多么担心，多么难受啊！”\\n\\n “哎呀呀！你们不也是吗！你们以为我就不担心你们的命运了吗？你们这下子可以得意地说把我吓坏了。”\\n\\n “好个乔！你还挺会倒打一耙的！”\\n\\n “我看，这一次掉下去，并没有改变他的脾气。”肯尼迪插了一句。\\n\\n “我的小伙子，在危险关头，你表现出了崇高的献身精神。是你救了我们，当时‘维多利亚号’正在往湖里坠落。要知道，气球一旦掉下去了，没有人能把它拉起来。”\\n\\n “什么献身呀！你们乐意的话，就说我翻了个筋斗好了。如果说我的所谓自我牺牲救了你们，不也救了我自己吗？瞧，我们3人的身体多健康！因此，想来想去，这件事从头至尾，我们都没有什么可自责的。”\\n\\n “算了吧！你就别指望这小伙子听你的。”猎人嚷道。\\n\\n “想要我听的最好办法，就是别再提这事啦。”乔说，“过去的事就过去了！不管是好是坏，反正不能再从头来一遍。”\\n\\n “嘿，真是个犟脾气！”博士笑道，“不过，至少你也要好好给我们讲讲这一段你怎么过来的吧？”\\n\\n “如果你们坚持非听不可的话，我就说几句吧。可是，在此之前，我想先把这只野鹅烤熟了。看来，前一段时间，肯尼迪先生没有闲着。”\\n\\n “你说得不错，乔。”\\n\\n “哈哈！我们来瞧瞧，这非洲的野味在欧洲人的肚皮里好不好消化。”\\n\\n 很快， 架在氢氧喷嘴上的野鹅烤好了。只一会儿的功夫，整只野鹅就被3人狼吞虎咽地消灭光了。乔可没少吃，一个人好多天没有东西下肚，的确够饿的了。喝过茶和烧酒后，乔给同伴们讲述了自己的冒险经历。尽管他对所遭遇的事像平时一样看得很开，但他说着说着，仍难免有几分动情。博士从乔的叙述中发现这位忠诚的仆人关心他比关心自己还多时，抑制不住地一次又一次握住他的手。当乔说到比迪奥玛人的小岛沉没时，博士给他解释说，这种情况在乍得湖经常发生。\\n\\n 最后，乔谈到他陷入沼泽地，发出最后一声绝望的呼喊时的情景。他说：\\n\\n “我以为这一下完了，主人，真的，当时我满脑子就想着您了。于是我拼命挣扎起来。到底干了些什么，我也说不上来。反正我铁了心，不能这么眼睁睁地让沼泽埋了。就在这时，我依稀看见两步开外有个东西。你们说是什么？一截才断不久的粗绳头！我使出了最后一点力气。结果还好，我勉勉强强够到了它。我拉了拉，绳子还挺能吃住劲。我就拽住绳子往外爬。最后总算爬上硬地了！看了绳子的另一头，我发现上面竟连着一个锚！……嗨！主人！如果您觉得没什么不便的话，我完全应该把它称为‘救命锚’！我一眼就认出了那只锚！它是‘维多利亚号’上的！我马上明白，你们曾经在那块硬地上着陆过！绳索的位置给我提示了你们往哪个方向飞的。我就顺着找。我费了不少气力，总算走出了沼泽地。有了勇气，我的劲也来了。我走了半夜，离湖越来越远。最后，我到了一块很大的村子边。那里有一块围起来的草地，里面关着一些马。那些马很温顺。生活中有的时候就是这样，不会骑马的一下子会骑了。你们说不对吗？我联想也没想，跳上一匹马，就往北猛跑。我说不来一个城市，因为我没有见过；我也说不来一个村子，因为我都是避开的。我骑着马跑过一块块庄稼地，穿过一簇簇荆棘丛，跨过一道道绿篱。我使劲赶着，吆喝着，逼它再跑快些。我一口气跑到耕地的边界，往前一看，嘿！是沙漠！这倒合我的胃口！往前看得更清楚，而且更远了。我时时刻刻希望看见‘维多利亚号’在慢慢地飞着等我。 但是，什么也没有。就这样跑了3个钟头后，我竟然傻乎乎地闯进了一个阿拉伯人的宿营地！唉！多像一场围猎！……。肯尼迪先生，要知道，一个猎人如果自己没被当作猎物追过，就不明白什么是打猎！不过，如果可能碰上这种事，我劝他还是别去试！后来，我的马累倒了，我也摔在地上，别人又紧紧逼了上来。我急了，一下子窜到一个阿拉伯人的马背上。我当时不是跟他过不去，我是没办法呀！我真心希望他别恨我掐杀了他！这时候，我看见你们了……。以后的事，你们都知道了。‘维多利亚号’跟在我后面。再以后嘛，你们像一个骑手骑着马捡地上的戒指一样，飞着把我救了上来。你们说，我指望你们难道不对吗？怎么样，弗格森先生？您看这一切多简单！再自然不过了。如果这样做还对你们有用的话，我随时准备再来一次！再说，主人，我给您说过，这件事不值得一提。”\\n\\n “真诚的乔！”博士激动地说，“我们的确没有看错你的聪明和机灵！”\\n\\n “呵！先生，只要顺其自然，车到山前必有路嘛！您瞧，最稳妥的莫过于既来之，则安之。”\\n\\n 乔讲述他的历险记的时候，气球已迅速飞过很长一段路程。这时，肯尼迪让两位同伴注意看远方地平线上的一片矮房，看模样像是一座城。博士马上查了一下地图，认出这是达迈古国的塔热莱尔镇。\\n\\n “我们又找到巴尔特博士走过的路线了。”博士说：“他当年就是在那儿与他的两位同伴理查逊和奥韦尔韦格分手的。理查逊走的想必是津德尔路线，奥韦尔韦格走的是马拉迪①路线。 你们还记得吗？这3位旅行家，只有巴尔特一人最后回到了欧洲。”\\n\\n ①尼日尔中部城市和省会。\\n\\n “这么说，根据‘维多利亚号’的飞行方向看，我们正一直往北去吗？”肯尼迪问。\\n\\n “亲爱的肯尼迪，正是如此。”\\n\\n “你不有点担心吗？”\\n\\n “为什么担心？”\\n\\n “因为这条路是到的黎波里的，我们又要到大沙漠了。”\\n\\n “唔，朋友，我们不会飞那么远，起码，我希望是这样。”\\n\\n “那么，你打算在哪儿停下？”\\n\\n “肯尼迪，难道你就不很想参观一下延巴克图②吗？”\\n\\n ②马里中部城市，历史名城，位于撒哈拉沙漠南缘。\\n\\n “延巴克图？”\\n\\n “当然想啦。”乔插话说，“不看看廷巴克图，就不能算是到非洲旅行！”\\n\\n “你将成为看见这座神秘之城的第5位或第6位欧洲人。”\\n\\n “去延巴克图！”\\n\\n “好吧！让风把我们带到北纬17度和18度之间，到时候我们再找一股能把‘维多利亚号’往西送的顺风，就行了。”\\n\\n “好极了。”猎人说，“可是，我们还要往北走很长的路吗？”\\n\\n “至少150英里。”\\n\\n “那么，我要睡一会儿了。”肯尼迪说。\\n\\n “先生，您睡吧。”乔说，“我的主人，您也该学学肯尼迪先生，去打个盹。你们都需要休息。我折腾得你们连觉都没能睡。”\\n\\n 猎人在帐篷里躺下。轻易不知累的弗格森仍待在他的观察位置上。\\n\\n 3个小时后， “维多利亚号”飞快地越过高山连绵的多石地区。大大小小的山上光秃秃的，全是些花岗岩。一些孤峰甚至高达4000尺。山脚下生长着茂密的刺槐、金合欢、战捷木和椰枣树。长颈鹿、瞪羚①和鸵鸟在林子里异常敏捷地跑来跳去。干旱贫瘠的茫茫沙漠消失后，大地又成了草木的王国。这儿是凯鲁阿人的地盘。和他们危险的邻居图瓦雷格人一样，凯鲁阿人也用棉布带裹头把脸包住。\\n\\n ①产于非洲和亚洲的一种小羚羊。\\n\\n 顺利地飞了250英里后， 晚上10点，“维多利亚号”停在了一个大城市上空。借着月色，隐约可以看见城市的一部分已坍塌一半。城里星星点点耸立着一些清真寺的尖塔。它们静静地沐浴在皎洁的月光中。博士观察了星星的方位，判断出他们现在是在阿加德兹上空。\\n\\n 这座城市过去曾是一个大的贸易中心，但是在巴尔特博士到来时，该城已经衰落了。\\n\\n 黑夜中， “维多利亚号”没被发现。它悄悄降落在阿加德兹以北2英里的一块宽阔的黍田地上。 一夜平平安安地过去了。早晨5点钟左右，一股微风吹拂着气球向西稍稍偏南的方向倾斜。\\n\\n 弗格森急忙抓住这个天赐良机。气球很快升了起来，在一缕朝阳中飞走了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/305/523.html","bookId":166,"book":{"id":166,"title":"气球上的五星期 Five Weeks in a Balloon","description":"简介： Five Weeks in a Balloon, or, Journeys and Discoveries in Africa by Three Englishmen (French: Cinq semaines en ballon) is an adventure novel by Jules Verne.
