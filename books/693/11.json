{"id":28994,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11 ＂The Stirring Of The Powers＂","content":"Rebecca\u0027s visit to Milltown was all that herglowing fancy had painted it, except thatrecent readings about Rome and Venicedisposed her to believe that those cities mighthave an advantage over Milltown in the matterof mere pictorial beauty. So soon does the souloutgrow its mansions that after once seeingMilltown her fancy ran out to the future sight ofPortland; for that, having islands and a harborand two public monuments, must be far morebeautiful than Milltown, which would, she felt, takeits proud place among the cities of the earth, byreason of its tremendous business activity ratherthan by any irresistible appeal to the imagination. 　　It would be impossible for two children to seemore, do more, walk more, talk more, eat more, orask more questions than Rebecca and Emma Janedid on that eventful Wednesday. 　　\"She\u0027s the best company I ever see in all mylife,\" said Mrs. Cobb to her husband that evening. 　　\"We ain\u0027t had a dull minute this day. She\u0027s well-mannered, too; she didn\u0027t ask for anything, andwas thankful for whatever she got. Did you watchher face when we went into that tent where theywas actin\u0027 out Uncle Tom\u0027s Cabin? And did youtake notice of the way she told us about the bookwhen we sat down to have our ice cream? I tell youHarriet Beecher Stowe herself couldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 doneit better justice.\"\"I took it all in,\" responded Mr. Cobb, who waspleased that \"mother\" agreed with him aboutRebecca. \"I ain\u0027t sure but she\u0027s goin\u0027 to turn outsomethin\u0027 remarkable,--a singer, or a writer, or alady doctor like that Miss Parks up to Cornish.\"\"Lady doctors are always home\u0027paths, ain\u0027tthey?\" asked Mrs. Cobb, who, it is needless to say,was distinctly of the old school in medicine. 　　\"Land, no, mother; there ain\u0027t no home\u0027path\u0027bout Miss Parks--she drives all over the country.\"\"I can\u0027t see Rebecca as a lady doctor, somehow,\"mused Mrs. Cobb. \"Her gift o\u0027 gab is what\u0027sgoin\u0027 to be the makin\u0027 of her; mebbe she\u0027ll lecture,or recite pieces, like that Portland elocutionist thatcome out here to the harvest supper.\"\"I guess she\u0027ll be able to write down her ownpieces,\" said Mr. Cobb confidently; \"she couldmake \u0027em up faster \u0027n she could read \u0027em out of abook.\"\"It\u0027s a pity she\u0027s so plain looking,\" remarkedMrs. Cobb, blowing out the candle. 　　\"PLAIN LOOKING, mother?\" exclaimed her husbandin astonishment. \"Look at the eyes of her;look at the hair of her, an\u0027 the smile, an\u0027 thatthere dimple! Look at Alice Robinson, that\u0027scalled the prettiest child on the river, an\u0027 see howRebecca shines her ri\u0027 down out o\u0027 sight! I hopeMirandy\u0027ll favor her comin\u0027 over to see us realoften, for she\u0027ll let off some of her steam here, an\u0027 　　the brick house\u0027ll be consid\u0027able safer for everybodyconcerned. We\u0027ve known what it was to hevchildren, even if \u0027t was more \u0027n thirty years ago,an\u0027 we can make allowances.\"Notwithstanding the encomiums of Mr. and Mrs. 　　Cobb, Rebecca made a poor hand at compositionwriting at this time. Miss Dearborn gave herevery sort of subject that she had ever been givenherself: Cloud Pictures; Abraham Lincoln; Nature;Philanthropy; Slavery; Intemperance; Joyand Duty; Solitude; but with none of them didRebecca seem to grapple satisfactorily. 　　\"Write as you talk, Rebecca,\" insisted poor MissDearborn, who secretly knew that she could nevermanage a good composition herself. 　　\"But gracious me, Miss Dearborn! I don\u0027t talkabout nature and slavery. I can\u0027t write unless Ihave something to say, can I?\"\"That is what compositions are for,\" returnedMiss Dearborn doubtfully; \"to make you havethings to say. Now in your last one, on solitude, youhaven\u0027t said anything very interesting, and you\u0027vemade it too common and every-day to sound well. 　　There are too many `yous\u0027 and `yours\u0027 in it; youought to say `one\u0027 now and then, to make it seemmore like good writing. `One opens a favoritebook;\u0027 `One\u0027s thoughts are a great comfort insolitude,\u0027 and so on.\"\"I don\u0027t know any more about solitude this weekthan I did about joy and duty last week,\" grumbledRebecca. 　　\"You tried to be funny about joy and duty,\"said Miss Dearborn reprovingly; \"so of course youdidn\u0027t succeed.\"\"I didn\u0027t know you were going to make us readthe things out loud,\" said Rebecca with an embarrassedsmile of recollection. 　　\"Joy and Duty\" had been the inspiring subjectgiven to the older children for a theme to be writtenin five minutes. 　　Rebecca had wrestled, struggled, perspired invain. When her turn came to read she was obligedto confess she had written nothing. 　　\"You have at least two lines, Rebecca,\" insistedthe teacher, \"for I see them on your slate.\"\"I\u0027d rather not read them, please; they are notgood,\" pleaded Rebecca. 　　\"Read what you have, good or bad, little ormuch; I am excusing nobody.\"Rebecca rose, overcome with secret laughterdread, and mortification; then in a low voice sheread the couplet:--When Joy and Duty clashLet Duty go to smash. 　　Dick Carter\u0027s head disappeared under the desk,while Living Perkins choked with laughter. 　　Miss Dearborn laughed too; she was little morethan a girl, and the training of the young idea seldomappealed to the sense of humor. 　　\"You must stay after school and try again,Rebecca,\" she said, but she said it smilingly. \"Yourpoetry hasn\u0027t a very nice idea in it for a good littlegirl who ought to love duty.\"\"It wasn\u0027t MY idea,\" said Rebecca apologetically. 　　\"I had only made the first line when I saw you weregoing to ring the bell and say the time was up. Ihad `clash\u0027 written, and I couldn\u0027t think of anythingthen but `hash\u0027 or `rash\u0027 or `smash.\u0027 I\u0027llchange it to this:--When Joy and Duty clash,\u0027T is Joy must go to smash.\"\"That is better,\" Miss Dearborn answered,\"though I cannot think `going to smash\u0027 is a prettyexpression for poetry.\"Having been instructed in the use of the indefinitepronoun \"one\" as giving a refined and elegant touchto literary efforts, Rebecca painstakingly rewroteher composition on solitude, giving it all the benefitof Miss Dearborn\u0027s suggestion. It then appeared inthe following form, which hardly satisfied eitherteacher or pupil:--SOLITUDEIt would be false to say that one could ever bealone when one has one\u0027s lovely thoughts to comfortone. One sits by one\u0027s self, it is true, but one thinks;one opens one\u0027s favorite book and reads one\u0027s favoritestory; one speaks to one\u0027s aunt or one\u0027s brother,fondles one\u0027s cat, or looks at one\u0027s photograph album. 　　There is one\u0027s work also: what a joy it is to one, ifone happens to like work. All one\u0027s little householdtasks keep one from being lonely. Does one everfeel bereft when one picks up one\u0027s chips to lightone\u0027s fire for one\u0027s evening meal? Or when onewashes one\u0027s milk pail before milking one\u0027s cow? 　　One would fancy not. 　　R. R. R. 　　\"It is perfectly dreadful,\" sighed Rebecca whenshe read it aloud after school. \"Putting in `one\u0027 allthe time doesn\u0027t make it sound any more like abook, and it looks silly besides.\"\"You say such queer things,\" objected MissDearborn. \"I don\u0027t see what makes you do it. 　　Why did you put in anything so common as pickingup chips?\"\"Because I was talking about `household tasks\u0027 　　in the sentence before, and it IS one of my householdtasks. Don\u0027t you think calling supper `one\u0027s evening meal\u0027 　　is pretty? and isn\u0027t `bereft\u0027 a nice word?\"\"Yes, that part of it does very well. It is the cat,the chips, and the milk pail that I don\u0027t like.\"\"All right!\" sighed Rebecca. \"Out they go;Does the cow go too?\"\"Yes, I don\u0027t like a cow in a composition,\" saidthe difficult Miss Dearborn. 　　The Milltown trip had not been without its tragicconsequences of a small sort; for the next weekMinnie Smellie\u0027s mother told Miranda Sawyer thatshe\u0027d better look after Rebecca, for she was givento \"swearing and profane language;\" that she hadbeen heard saying something dreadful that veryafternoon, saying it before Emma Jane and LivingPerkins, who only laughed and got down on allfours and chased her. 　　Rebecca, on being confronted and charged withthe crime, denied it indignantly, and aunt Janebelieved her. 　　\"Search your memory, Rebecca, and try to thinkwhat Minnie overheard you say,\" she pleaded. 　　\"Don\u0027t be ugly and obstinate, but think real hard. 　　When did they chase you up the road, and whatwere you doing?\"A sudden light broke upon Rebecca\u0027s darkness. 　　\"Oh! I see it now,\" she exclaimed. \"It hadrained hard all the morning, you know, and theroad was full of puddles. Emma Jane, Living, andI were walking along, and I was ahead. I saw thewater streaming over the road towards the ditch, andit reminded me of Uncle Tom\u0027s Cabin at Milltown,when Eliza took her baby and ran across the Mississippion the ice blocks, pursued by the bloodhounds. 　　We couldn\u0027t keep from laughing after we came outof the tent because they were acting on such a smallplatform that Eliza had to run round and round, andpart of the time the one dog they had pursued her,and part of the time she had to pursue the dog. Iknew Living would remember, too, so I took off mywaterproof and wrapped it round my books for ababy; then I shouted, `MY GOD! THE RIVER!\u0027 justlike that--the same as Eliza did in the play; thenI leaped from puddle to puddle, and Living andEmma Jane pursued me like the bloodhounds. It\u0027sjust like that stupid Minnie Smellie who doesn\u0027tknow a game when she sees one. And Eliza wasn\u0027tswearing when she said `My God! the river!\u0027 Itwas more like praying.\"\"Well, you\u0027ve got no call to be prayin\u0027, any morethan swearin\u0027, in the middle of the road,\" saidMiranda; \"but I\u0027m thankful it\u0027s no worse. You\u0027reborn to trouble as the sparks fly upward, an\u0027 I\u0027mafraid you allers will be till you learn to bridle yourunruly tongue.\"\"I wish sometimes that I could bridle Minnie\u0027s,\"murmured Rebecca, as she went to set the table forsupper. 　　\"I declare she IS the beatin\u0027est child!\" saidMiranda, taking off her spectacles and laying downher mending. \"You don\u0027t think she\u0027s a leetle mitecrazy, do you, Jane?\"\"I don\u0027t think she\u0027s like the rest of us,\"responded Jane thoughtfully and with some anxietyin her pleasant face; \"but whether it\u0027s for thebetter or the worse I can\u0027t hardly tell till she growsup. She\u0027s got the making of \u0027most anything in her,Rebecca has; but I feel sometimes as if we werenot fitted to cope with her.\"\"Stuff an\u0027 nonsense!\" said Miranda \"Speakfor yourself. I feel fitted to cope with any childthat ever was born int\u0027 the world!\"\"I know you do, Mirandy; but that don\u0027t MAKEyou so,\" returned Jane with a smile. 　　The habit of speaking her mind freely wascertainly growing on Jane to an altogether terrifyingextent.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/521/360.html","bookId":693,"book":{"id":693,"title":"Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm","description":"简介： Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm is a classic American 1903 children\u0027s novel by Kate Douglas Wiggin that tells the story of Rebecca Rowena Randall and her two stern aunts in the village of Riverboro, Maine.
