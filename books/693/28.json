{"id":29011,"no":28,"title":"Chapter 28 ＂Th\u0027 Inevitable Yoke＂","content":"Rebecca\u0027s heart beat high at this sweetpraise from her hero\u0027s lips, but before shehad found words to thank him, Mr. andMrs. Cobb, who had been modestly biding theirtime in a corner, approached her and she introducedthem to Mr. Ladd.\\n\\n 　　\"Where, where is aunt Jane?\" she cried, holdingaunt Sarah\u0027s hand on one side and uncle Jerry\u0027son the other.\\n\\n 　　\"I\u0027m sorry, lovey, but we\u0027ve got bad news foryou.\"\"Is aunt Miranda worse? She is; I can see itby your looks;\" and Rebecca\u0027s color faded.\\n\\n 　　\"She had a second stroke yesterday morningjest when she was helpin\u0027 Jane lay out her thingsto come here to-day. Jane said you wan\u0027t to knowanything about it till the exercises was all over, andwe promised to keep it secret till then.\"\"I will go right home with you, aunt Sarah. Imust just run to tell Miss Maxwell, for after I hadpacked up to-morrow I was going to Brunswick withher. Poor aunt Miranda! And I have been so gayand happy all day, except that I was longing formother and aunt Jane.\"\"There ain\u0027t no harm in bein\u0027 gay, lovey; that\u0027swhat Jane wanted you to be. And Miranda\u0027s gother speech back, for your aunt has just sent a lettersayin\u0027 she\u0027s better; and I\u0027m goin\u0027 to set up to-night,so you can stay here and have a good sleep, and getyour things together comfortably to-morrow.\"\"I\u0027ll pack your trunk for you, Becky dear, andattend to all our room things,\" said Emma Jane,who had come towards the group and heard thesorrowful news from the brick house.\\n\\n 　　They moved into one of the quiet side pews,where Hannah and her husband and John joinedthem. From time to time some straggling acquaintanceor old schoolmate would come up to congratulateRebecca and ask why she had hidden herselfin a corner. Then some member of the class wouldcall to her excitedly, reminding her not to be lateat the picnic luncheon, or begging her to be earlyat the class party in the evening. All this had anair of unreality to Rebecca. In the midst of thehappy excitement of the last two days, when\"blushing honors\" had been falling thick upon her, andbehind the delicious exaltation of the morning, hadbeen the feeling that the condition was a transientone, and that the burden, the struggle, the anxiety,would soon loom again on the horizon. She longedto steal away into the woods with dear old John,grown so manly and handsome, and get some comfortfrom him.\\n\\n 　　Meantime Adam Ladd and Mr. Cobb had beenhaving an animated conversation.\\n\\n 　　\"I s\u0027pose up to Boston, girls like that one are asthick as blackb\u0027ries?\" uncle Jerry said, jerking hishead interrogatively in Rebecca\u0027s direction.\\n\\n 　　\"They may be,\" smiled Adam, taking in the oldman\u0027s mood; \"only I don\u0027t happen to know one.\"\"My eyesight bein\u0027 poor \u0027s the reason she lookedhan\u0027somest of any girl on the platform, I s\u0027pose?\"\"There\u0027s no failure in my eyes,\" responded Adam,\"but that was how the thing seemed to me!\"\"What did you think of her voice? Anythingextry about it?\"\"Made the others sound poor and thin, Ithought.\"\"Well, I\u0027m glad to hear your opinion, you bein\u0027\\n\\n 　　a traveled man, for mother says I\u0027m foolish \u0027boutRebecky and hev been sence the fust. Motherscolds me for spoilin\u0027 her, but I notice mother ain\u0027tfur behind when it comes to spoilin\u0027. Land! itmade me sick, thinkin\u0027 o\u0027 them parents travelin\u0027\\n\\n 　　miles to see their young ones graduate, and thenwhen they got here hevin\u0027 to compare \u0027em with Rebecky.\\n\\n 　　Good-by, Mr. Ladd, drop in some day whenyou come to Riverboro.\"\"I will,\" said Adam, shaking the old man\u0027s handcordially; \"perhaps to-morrow if I drive Rebeccahome, as I shall offer to do. Do you think MissSawyer\u0027s condition is serious?\"\"Well, the doctor don\u0027t seem to know; but anyhowshe\u0027s paralyzed, and she\u0027ll never walk furagain, poor soul! She ain\u0027t lost her speech; that\u0027llbe a comfort to her.\"Adam left the church, and in crossing the commoncame upon Miss Maxwell doing the honorsof the institution, as she passed from group togroup of strangers and guests. Knowing thatshe was deeply interested in all Rebecca\u0027s plans, hetold her, as he drew her aside, that the girl wouldhave to leave Wareham for Riverboro the nextday.\\n\\n 　　\"That is almost more than I can bear!\" exclaimedMiss Maxwell, sitting down on a bench and stabbingthe greensward with her parasol. \"It seems to meRebecca never has any respite. I had so manyplans for her this next month in fitting her for herposition, and now she will settle down to houseworkagain, and to the nursing of that poor, sick,cross old aunt.\"\"If it had not been for the cross old aunt,Rebecca would still have been at Sunnybrook; andfrom the standpoint of educational advantages, orindeed advantages of any sort, she might as wellhave been in the backwoods,\" returned Adam.\\n\\n 　　\"That is true; I was vexed when I spoke, for Ithought an easier and happier day was dawning formy prodigy and pearl.\"\"OUR prodigy and pearl,\" corrected Adam.\\n\\n 　　\"Oh, yes!\" she laughed. \"I always forget thatit pleases you to pretend you discovered Rebecca.\"\"I believe, though, that happier days are dawningfor her,\" continued Adam. \"It must be a secretfor the present, but Mrs. Randall\u0027s farm will bebought by the new railroad. We must have rightof way through the land, and the station will bebuilt on her property. She will receive six thousanddollars, which, though not a fortune, will yield herthree or four hundred dollars a year, if she willallow me to invest it for her. There is a mortgageon the land; that paid, and Rebecca self-supporting,the mother ought to push the education of the oldestboy, who is a fine, ambitious fellow. He shouldbe taken away from farm work and settled at hisstudies.\"\"We might form ourselves into a RandallProtective Agency, Limited,\" mused Miss Maxwell. \"Iconfess I want Rebecca to have a career.\"\"I don\u0027t,\" said Adam promptly.\\n\\n 　　\"Of course you don\u0027t. Men have no interest inthe careers of women! But I know Rebecca betterthan you.\"\"You understand her mind better, but notnecessarily her heart. You are considering her for themoment as prodigy; I am thinking of her more aspearl.\"\"Well,\" sighed Miss Maxwell whimsically, \"prodigyor pearl, the Randall Protective Agency maypull Rebecca in opposite directions, but neverthelessshe will follow her saint.\"That will content me,\" said Adam gravely.\\n\\n 　　\"Particularly if the saint beckons your way.\"And Miss Maxwell looked up and smiled provokingly.\\n\\n 　　Rebecca did not see her aunt Miranda till shehad been at the brick house for several days.\\n\\n 　　Miranda steadily refused to have any one but Jane inthe room until her face had regained its naturallook, but her door was always ajar, and Jane fanciedshe liked to hear Rebecca\u0027s quick, light step. Hermind was perfectly clear now, and, save that shecould not move, she was most of the time quite freefrom pain, and alert in every nerve to all that wasgoing on within or without the house. \"Were thewindfall apples being picked up for sauce; were thepotatoes thick in the hills; was the corn tosselin\u0027\\n\\n 　　out; were they cuttin\u0027 the upper field; were theykeepin\u0027 fly-paper laid out everywheres; were thereany ants in the dairy; was the kindlin\u0027 wood holdin\u0027\\n\\n 　　out; had the bank sent the cowpons?\"Poor Miranda Sawyer! Hovering on the vergeof the great beyond,--her body \"struck\" and nolonger under control of her iron will,--no divinevisions floated across her tired brain; nothing butpetty cares and sordid anxieties. Not all at oncecan the soul talk with God, be He ever so near. Ifthe heavenly language never has been learned,quick as is the spiritual sense in seizing the facts itneeds, then the poor soul must use the words andphrases it has lived on and grown into day by day.\\n\\n 　　Poor Miss Miranda!--held fast within the prisonwalls of her own nature, blind in the presence ofrevelation because she had never used the spiritualeye, deaf to angelic voices because she had not usedthe spiritual ear.\\n\\n 　　There came a morning when she asked forRebecca. The door was opened into the dim sick-room, and Rebecca stood there with the sunlightbehind her, her hands full of sweet peas. Miranda\u0027spale, sharp face, framed in its nightcap, lookedhaggard on the pillow, and her body was pitifully stillunder the counterpane.\\n\\n 　　\"Come in,\" she said; \"I ain\u0027t dead yet. Don\u0027tmess up the bed with them flowers, will ye?\"\"Oh, no! They\u0027re going in a glass pitcher,\" saidRebecca, turning to the washstand as she tried tocontrol her voice and stop the tears that sprangto her eyes.\\n\\n 　　\"Let me look at ye; come closer. What dressare ye wearin\u0027?\" said the old aunt in her cracked,weak voice.\\n\\n 　　\"My blue calico.\"\"Is your cashmere holdin\u0027 its color?\"\"Yes, aunt Miranda.\"\"Do you keep it in a dark closet hung on thewrong side, as I told ye?\"\"Always.\"\"Has your mother made her jelly?\"\"She hasn\u0027t said.\"\"She always had the knack o\u0027 writin\u0027 letters withnothin\u0027 in \u0027em. What\u0027s Mark broke sence I\u0027ve beensick?\"\"Nothing at all, aunt Miranda.\"\"Why, what\u0027s the matter with him? Gittin\u0027\\n\\n 　　lazy, ain\u0027t he? How \u0027s John turnin\u0027 out?\"\"He\u0027s going to be the best of us all.\"\"I hope you don\u0027t slight things in the kitchenbecause I ain\u0027t there. Do you scald the coffee-potand turn it upside down on the winder-sill?\"\"Yes, aunt Miranda.\"\"It\u0027s always `yes\u0027 with you, and `yes\u0027 withJane,\" groaned Miranda, trying to move her stiffenedbody; \"but all the time I lay here knowin\u0027\\n\\n 　　there\u0027s things done the way I don\u0027t like \u0027em.\"There was a long pause, during which Rebeccasat down by the bedside and timidly touched heraunt\u0027s hand, her heart swelling with tender pity atthe gaunt face and closed eyes.\\n\\n 　　\"I was dreadful ashamed to have you graduatein cheesecloth, Rebecca, but I couldn\u0027t help it no-how. You\u0027ll hear the reason some time, and knowI tried to make it up to ye. I\u0027m afraid you was alaughin\u0027-stock!\"\"No,\" Rebecca answered. \"Ever so many peoplesaid our dresses were the very prettiest; they lookedlike soft lace. You\u0027re not to be anxious aboutanything. Here I am all grown up and graduated,--number three in a class of twenty-two, auntMiranda,--and good positions offered me already.\\n\\n 　　Look at me, big and strong and young, all ready togo into the world and show what you and auntJane have done for me. If you want me near, I\u0027lltake the Edgewood school, so that I can be herenights and Sundays to help; and if you get better,then I\u0027ll go to Augusta,--for that\u0027s a hundreddollars more, with music lessons and other thingsbeside.\"\"You listen to me,\" said Miranda quaveringly.\\n\\n 　　\"Take the best place, regardless o\u0027 my sickness.\\n\\n 　　I\u0027d like to live long enough to know you\u0027d paid offthat mortgage, but I guess I shan\u0027t.\"Here she ceased abruptly, having talked morethan she had for weeks; and Rebecca stole out ofthe room, to cry by herself and wonder if old agemust be so grim, so hard, so unchastened andunsweetened, as it slipped into the valley of theshadow.\\n\\n 　　The days went on, and Miranda grew strongerand stronger; her will seemed unassailable, andbefore long she could be moved into a chair by thewindow, her dominant thought being to arrive atsuch a condition of improvement that the doctorneed not call more than once a week, instead ofdaily; thereby diminishing the bill, that was mount-ing to such a terrifying sum that it haunted herthoughts by day and dreams by night.\\n\\n 　　Little by little hope stole back into Rebecca\u0027syoung heart. Aunt Jane began to \"clear starch\"her handkerchiefs and collars and purple muslindress, so that she might be ready to go to Brunswickat any moment when the doctor pronouncedMiranda well on the road to recovery. Everythingbeautiful was to happen in Brunswick if shecould be there by August,--everything that heartcould wish or imagination conceive, for she was tobe Miss Emily\u0027s very own visitor, and sit at tablewith college professors and other great men.\\n\\n 　　At length the day dawned when the few clean,simple dresses were packed in the hair trunk,together with her beloved coral necklace, her cheeseclothgraduating dress, her class pin, aunt Jane\u0027slace cape, and the one new hat, which she tried onevery night before going to bed. It was of whitechip with a wreath of cheap white roses and greenleaves, and cost between two and three dollars, anunprecedented sum in Rebecca\u0027s experience. Theeffect of its glories when worn with her nightdresswas dazzling enough, but if ever it appeared inconjunction with the cheesecloth gown, Rebecca feltthat even reverend professors might regard it withrespect. It is probable indeed that any professorialgaze lucky enough to meet a pair of dark eyes shiningunder that white rose garland would never havestopped at respect!\\n\\n 　　Then, when all was ready and Abijah Flagg atthe door, came a telegram from Hannah: \"Comeat once. Mother has had bad accident.\"In less than an hour Rebecca was started on herway to Sunnybrook, her heart palpitating with fearas to what might be awaiting her at her journey\u0027send.\\n\\n 　　Death, at all events, was not there to meet her;but something that looked at first only too muchlike it. Her mother had been standing on thehaymow superintending some changes in the barn,had been seized with giddiness, they thought, andslipped. The right knee was fractured and the backstrained and hurt, but she was conscious and in noimmediate danger, so Rebecca wrote, when she hada moment to send aunt Jane the particulars.\\n\\n 　　\"I don\u0027 know how \u0027tis,\" grumbled Miranda, whowas not able to sit up that day; \"but from a childI could never lay abed without Aurelia\u0027s gettin\u0027 sicktoo. I don\u0027 know \u0027s she could help fallin\u0027, thoughit ain\u0027t anyplace for a woman,--a haymow; butif it hadn\u0027t been that, \u0027t would \u0027a\u0027 been somethin\u0027\\n\\n 　　else. Aurelia was born unfortunate. Now she\u0027llprobably be a cripple, and Rebecca\u0027ll have to nurseher instead of earning a good income somewhereselse.\"\"Her first duty \u0027s to her mother,\" said aunt Jane;\"I hope she\u0027ll always remember that.\"\"Nobody remembers anything they\u0027d ought to,--at seventeen,\" responded Miranda. \"Now thatI\u0027m strong again, there\u0027s things I want to considerwith you, Jane, things that are on my mind nightand day. We\u0027ve talked \u0027em over before; now we\u0027llsettle \u0027em. When I\u0027m laid away, do you want totake Aurelia and the children down here to the brickhouse? There\u0027s an awful passel of \u0027em,--Aurelia,Jenny, and Fanny; but I won\u0027t have Mark. Hannahcan take him; I won\u0027t have a great boy stompin\u0027\\n\\n 　　out the carpets and ruinin\u0027 the furniture, thoughI know when I\u0027m dead I can\u0027t hinder ye, if youmake up your mind to do anything.\"\"I shouldn\u0027t like to go against your feelings,especially in laying out your money, Miranda,\" saidJane.\\n\\n 　　\"Don\u0027t tell Rebecca I\u0027ve willed her the brickhouse. She won\u0027t git it till I\u0027m gone, and I want totake my time \u0027bout dyin\u0027 and not be hurried off bythem that\u0027s goin\u0027 to profit by it; nor I don\u0027t want tobe thanked, neither. I s\u0027pose she\u0027ll use the frontstairs as common as the back and like as not havewater brought into the kitchen, but mebbe whenI\u0027ve been dead a few years I shan\u0027t mind. She setssuch store by you, she\u0027ll want you to have your homehere as long\u0027s you live, but anyway I\u0027ve wrote itdown that way; though Lawyer Burns\u0027s wills don\u0027thold more\u0027n half the time. He\u0027s cheaper, but Iguess it comes out jest the same in the end. Iwan\u0027t goin\u0027 to have the fust man Rebecca picks upfor a husband turnin\u0027 you ou\u0027doors.\"There was a long pause, during which Jane knitsilently, wiping the tears from her eyes from timeto time, as she looked at the pitiful figure lyingweakly on the pillows. Suddenly Miranda said slowlyand feebly:--\"I don\u0027 know after all but you might as welltake Mark; I s\u0027pose there\u0027s tame boys as well aswild ones. There ain\u0027t a mite o\u0027 sense in havin\u0027\\n\\n 　　so many children, but it\u0027s a turrible risk splittin\u0027 upfamilies and farmin\u0027 \u0027em out here \u0027n\u0027 there; they\u0027dnever come to no good, an\u0027 everybody would keeprememberin\u0027 their mother was a Sawyer. Now ifyou\u0027ll draw down the curtin, I\u0027ll try to sleep.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/521/377.html","bookId":693,"book":{"id":693,"title":"Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm","description":"简介： Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm is a classic American 1903 children\u0027s novel by Kate Douglas Wiggin that tells the story of Rebecca Rowena Randall and her two stern aunts in the village of Riverboro, Maine.
