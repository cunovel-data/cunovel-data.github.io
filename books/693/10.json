{"id":28993,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10 Rainbow Bridges","content":"Uncle Jerry coughed and stirred in hischair a good deal during Rebecca\u0027s recital,but he carefully concealed any unduefeeling of sympathy, just muttering, \"Poor little soul! 　　We\u0027ll see what we can do for her!\"\"You will take me to Maplewood, won\u0027t you, Mr. 　　Cobb?\" begged Rebecca piteously. 　　\"Don\u0027t you fret a mite,\" he answered, with acrafty little notion at the back of his mind; \"I\u0027llsee the lady passenger through somehow. Nowtake a bite o\u0027 somethin\u0027 to eat, child. Spread someo\u0027 that tomato preserve on your bread; draw up tothe table. How\u0027d you like to set in mother\u0027s placean\u0027 pour me out another cup o\u0027 hot tea?\"Mr. Jeremiah Cobb\u0027s mental machinery wassimple, and did not move very smoothly save whenpropelled by his affection or sympathy. In thepresent case these were both employed to hisadvantage, and mourning his stupidity and prayingfor some flash of inspiration to light his path, heblundered along, trusting to Providence. 　　Rebecca, comforted by the old man\u0027s tone, andtimidly enjoying the dignity of sitting in Mrs. Cobb\u0027sseat and lifting the blue china teapot, smiled faintly,smoothed her hair, and dried her eyes. 　　\"I suppose your mother\u0027ll be turrible glad tosee you back again?\" queried Mr. Cobb. 　　A tiny fear--just a baby thing--in the bottomof Rebecca\u0027s heart stirred and grew larger the momentit was touched with a question. 　　\"She won\u0027t like it that I ran away, I s\u0027pose, andshe\u0027ll be sorry that I couldn\u0027t please aunt Mirandy;but I\u0027ll make her understand, just as I did you.\"\"I s\u0027pose she was thinkin\u0027 o\u0027 your schoolin\u0027,lettin\u0027 you come down here; but land! you can go toschool in Temperance, I s\u0027pose?\"\"There\u0027s only two months\u0027 school now inTemperance, and the farm \u0027s too far from all the otherschools.\"\"Oh well! there\u0027s other things in the worldbeside edjercation,\" responded uncle Jerry, attackinga piece of apple pie. 　　\"Ye--es; though mother thought that was goingto be the making of me,\" returned Rebecca sadly,giving a dry little sob as she tried to drink her tea. 　　\"It\u0027ll be nice for you to be all together againat the farm--such a house full o\u0027 children!\"remarked the dear old deceiver, who longed fornothing so much as to cuddle and comfort the poorlittle creature. 　　\"It\u0027s too full--that\u0027s the trouble. But I\u0027llmake Hannah come to Riverboro in my place.\"\"S\u0027pose Mirandy \u0027n\u0027 Jane\u0027ll have her? I shouldbe \u0027most afraid they wouldn\u0027t. They\u0027ll be kind o\u0027 　　mad at your goin\u0027 home, you know, and you can\u0027thardly blame \u0027em.\"This was quite a new thought,--that the brickhouse might be closed to Hannah, since she, Rebecca,had turned her back upon its cold hospitality. 　　\"How is this school down here in Riverboro--pretty good?\" inquired uncle Jerry, whose brainwas working with an altogether unaccustomedrapidity,--so much so that it almost terrified him. 　　\"Oh, it\u0027s a splendid school! And MissDearborn is a splendid teacher!\"\"You like her, do you? Well, you\u0027d better believeshe returns the compliment. Mother was down tothe store this afternoon buyin\u0027 liniment for SethStrout, an\u0027 she met Miss Dearborn on the bridge. 　　They got to talkin\u0027 \u0027bout school, for mother hassummer-boarded a lot o\u0027 the schoolmarms, an\u0027 likes\u0027em. `How does the little Temperance girl gitalong?\u0027 asks mother. `Oh, she\u0027s the best scholarI have!\u0027 says Miss Dearborn. `I could teach schoolfrom sun-up to sun-down if scholars was all likeRebecca Randall,\u0027 says she.\"\"Oh, Mr. Cobb, DID she say that?\" glowedRebecca, her face sparkling and dimpling in an instant. 　　\"I\u0027ve tried hard all the time, but I\u0027ll study thecovers right off of the books now.\"\"You mean you would if you\u0027d ben goin\u0027 tostay here,\" interposed uncle Jerry. \"Now ain\u0027t ittoo bad you\u0027ve jest got to give it all up on accounto\u0027 your aunt Mirandy? Well, I can\u0027t hardly blameye. She\u0027s cranky an\u0027 she\u0027s sour; I should thinkshe\u0027d ben nussed on bonny-clabber an\u0027 greenapples. She needs bearin\u0027 with; an\u0027 I guess youain\u0027t much on patience, be ye?\"\"Not very much,\" replied Rebecca dolefully. 　　\"If I\u0027d had this talk with ye yesterday,\" pursuedMr. Cobb, \"I believe I\u0027d have advised ye different. 　　It\u0027s too late now, an\u0027 I don\u0027t feel to say you\u0027veben all in the wrong; but if \u0027t was to do over again,I\u0027d say, well, your aunt Mirandy gives you clothesand board and schoolin\u0027 and is goin\u0027 to send youto Wareham at a big expense. She\u0027s turrible hardto get along with, an\u0027 kind o\u0027 heaves benefits atyour head, same \u0027s she would bricks; but they\u0027rebenefits jest the same, an\u0027 mebbe it\u0027s your job tokind o\u0027 pay for \u0027em in good behavior. Jane\u0027s aleetle bit more easy goin\u0027 than Mirandy, ain\u0027t she,or is she jest as hard to please?\"\"Oh, aunt Jane and I get along splendidly,\"exclaimed Rebecca; \"she\u0027s just as good and kindas she can be, and I like her better all the time. 　　I think she kind of likes me, too; she smoothedmy hair once. I\u0027d let her scold me all day long,for she understands; but she can\u0027t stand up for meagainst aunt Mirandy; she\u0027s about as afraid ofher as I am.\"\"Jane\u0027ll be real sorry to-morrow to find you\u0027vegone away, I guess; but never mind, it can\u0027t behelped. If she has a kind of a dull time with Mirandy,on account o\u0027 her bein\u0027 so sharp, why of courseshe\u0027d set great store by your comp\u0027ny. Mother wastalkin\u0027 with her after prayer meetin\u0027 the other night. 　　`You wouldn\u0027t know the brick house, Sarah,\u0027 saysJane. `I\u0027m keepin\u0027 a sewin\u0027 school, an\u0027 my scholarhas made three dresses. What do you think o\u0027 　　that,\u0027 says she, `for an old maid\u0027s child? I\u0027vetaken a class in Sunday-school,\u0027 says Jane, `an\u0027 　　think o\u0027 renewin\u0027 my youth an\u0027 goin\u0027 to the picnicwith Rebecca,\u0027 says she; an\u0027 mother declares shenever see her look so young \u0027n\u0027 happy.\"There was a silence that could be felt in the littlekitchen; a silence only broken by the ticking ofthe tall clock and the beating of Rebecca\u0027s heart,which, it seemed to her, almost drowned the voiceof the clock. The rain ceased, a sudden rosy lightfilled the room, and through the window a rainbowarch could be seen spanning the heavens likea radiant bridge. Bridges took one across difficultplaces, thought Rebecca, and uncle Jerry seemedto have built one over her troubles and given herstrength to walk. 　　\"The shower \u0027s over,\" said the old man, fillinghis pipe; \"it\u0027s cleared the air, washed the face o\u0027 　　the airth nice an\u0027 clean, an\u0027 everything to-morrerwill shine like a new pin--when you an\u0027 I aredrivin\u0027 up river.\"Rebecca pushed her cup away, rose from thetable, and put on her hat and jacket quietly. \"I\u0027mnot going to drive up river, Mr. Cobb,\" she said. 　　\"I\u0027m going to stay here and--catch bricks; catch\u0027em without throwing \u0027em back, too. I don\u0027t knowas aunt Mirandy will take me in after I\u0027ve runaway, but I\u0027m going back now while I have thecourage. You wouldn\u0027t be so good as to go withme, would you, Mr. Cobb?\"\"You\u0027d better b\u0027lieve your uncle Jerry don\u0027tpropose to leave till he gits this thing fixed up,\"cried the old man delightedly. \"Now you\u0027ve hadall you can stan\u0027 to-night, poor little soul, withoutgettin\u0027 a fit o\u0027 sickness; an\u0027 Mirandy\u0027ll be sorean\u0027 cross an\u0027 in no condition for argyment; so myplan is jest this: to drive you over to the brickhouse in my top buggy; to have you set back inthe corner, an\u0027 I git out an\u0027 go to the side door;an\u0027 when I git your aunt Mirandy \u0027n\u0027 aunt Janeout int\u0027 the shed to plan for a load o\u0027 wood I\u0027mgoin\u0027 to have hauled there this week, you\u0027ll slipout o\u0027 the buggy and go upstairs to bed. The frontdoor won\u0027t be locked, will it?\"\"Not this time of night,\" Rebecca answered;\"not till aunt Mirandy goes to bed; but oh! whatif it should be?\"\"Well, it won\u0027t; an\u0027 if \u0027t is, why we\u0027ll have toface it out; though in my opinion there\u0027s thingsthat won\u0027t bear facin\u0027 out an\u0027 had better be settledcomfortable an\u0027 quiet. You see you ain\u0027t run awayyet; you\u0027ve only come over here to consult me\u0027bout runnin\u0027 away, an\u0027 we\u0027ve concluded it ain\u0027twuth the trouble. The only real sin you\u0027vecommitted, as I figger it out, was in comin\u0027 here by thewinder when you\u0027d ben sent to bed. That ain\u0027t sovery black, an\u0027 you can tell your aunt Jane \u0027boutit come Sunday, when she\u0027s chock full o\u0027 religion,an\u0027 she can advise you when you\u0027d better tell youraunt Mirandy. I don\u0027t believe in deceivin\u0027 folks,but if you\u0027ve hed hard thoughts you ain\u0027t obleegedto own \u0027em up; take \u0027em to the Lord in prayer, asthe hymn says, and then don\u0027t go on hevin\u0027 \u0027em. 　　Now come on; I\u0027m all hitched up to go over tothe post-office; don\u0027t forget your bundle; `it\u0027salways a journey, mother, when you carry a nightgown;\u0027 　　them \u0027s the first words your uncle Jerryever heard you say! He didn\u0027t think you\u0027d bebringin\u0027 your nightgown over to his house. Stepin an\u0027 curl up in the corner; we ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to letfolks see little runaway gals, \u0027cause they\u0027re goin\u0027 　　back to begin all over ag\u0027in!\"When Rebecca crept upstairs, and undressing inthe dark finally found herself in her bed that night,though she was aching and throbbing in everynerve, she felt a kind of peace stealing over her. 　　She had been saved from foolishness and error;kept from troubling her poor mother; preventedfrom angering and mortifying her aunts. 　　Her heart was melted now, and she determinedto win aunt Miranda\u0027s approval by some desperatemeans, and to try and forget the one thing thatrankled worst, the scornful mention of her father,of whom she thought with the greatest admiration,and whom she had not yet heard criticised; forsuch sorrows and disappointments as Aurelia Randallhad suffered had never been communicated toher children. 　　It would have been some comfort to the bruised,unhappy little spirit to know that Miranda Sawyerwas passing an uncomfortable night, and thatshe tacitly regretted her harshness, partly becauseJane had taken such a lofty and virtuous positionin the matter. She could not endure Jane\u0027s disapproval,although she would never have confessed tosuch a weakness. 　　As uncle Jerry drove homeward under the stars,well content with his attempts at keeping the peace,he thought wistfully of the touch of Rebecca\u0027s headon his knee, and the rain of her tears on his hand;of the sweet reasonableness of her mind when shehad the matter put rightly before her; of her quickdecision when she had once seen the path of duty;of the touching hunger for love and understandingthat were so characteristic in her. \"LordA\u0027mighty!\" he ejaculated under his breath, \"LordA\u0027mighty! to hector and abuse a child like thatone! \u0027T ain\u0027t ABUSE exactly, I know, or \u0027t wouldn\u0027tbe to some o\u0027 your elephant-hided young ones; butto that little tender will-o\u0027-the-wisp a hard word \u0027slike a lash. Mirandy Sawyer would be a heap betterwoman if she had a little gravestun to remember,same\u0027s mother \u0027n\u0027 I have.\"\"I never see a child improve in her work asRebecca has to-day,\" remarked Miranda Sawyer toJane on Saturday evening. \"That settin\u0027 down Igave her was probably just what she needed, andI daresay it\u0027ll last for a month.\"\"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re pleased,\" returned Jane. \"Acringing worm is what you want, not a bright, smilingchild. Rebecca looks to me as if she\u0027d beenthrough the Seven Years\u0027 War. When she camedownstairs this morning it seemed to me she\u0027dgrown old in the night. If you follow my advice,which you seldom do, you\u0027ll let me take her andEmma Jane down beside the river to-morrow afternoonand bring Emma Jane home to a good Sundaysupper. Then if you\u0027ll let her go to Milltown withthe Cobbs on Wednesday, that\u0027ll hearten her upa little and coax back her appetite. Wednesday \u0027s aholiday on account of Miss Dearborn\u0027s going hometo her sister\u0027s wedding, and the Cobbs and Perkinseswant to go down to the Agricultural Fair.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/521/359.html","bookId":693,"book":{"id":693,"title":"Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm","description":"简介： Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm is a classic American 1903 children\u0027s novel by Kate Douglas Wiggin that tells the story of Rebecca Rowena Randall and her two stern aunts in the village of Riverboro, Maine.
