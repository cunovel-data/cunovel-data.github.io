{"id":29009,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26 Over The Teacups","content":"The summer term at Wareham had ended,and Huldah Meserve, Dick Carter, andLiving Perkins had finished school, leavingRebecca and Emma Jane to represent Riverboroin the year to come. Delia Weeks was at homefrom Lewiston on a brief visit, and Mrs. Robinsonwas celebrating the occasion by a small and selectparty, the particular day having been set becausestrawberries were ripe and there was a rooster thatwanted killing. Mrs. Robinson explained this to herhusband, and requested that he eat his dinner onthe carpenter\u0027s bench in the shed, as the party wasto be a ladies\u0027 affair.\\n\\n 　　\"All right; it won\u0027t be any loss to me,\" said Mr.\\n\\n 　　Robinson. \"Give me beans, that\u0027s all I ask. Whena rooster wants to be killed, I want somebody elseto eat him, not me!\"Mrs. Robinson had company only once or twicea year, and was generally much prostrated for severaldays afterward, the struggle between pride andparsimony being quite too great a strain upon her.\\n\\n 　　It was necessary, in order to maintain her standingin the community, to furnish a good \"set out,\" yetthe extravagance of the proceeding goaded her fromthe first moment she began to stir the marble caketo the moment when the feast appeared upon thetable.\\n\\n 　　The rooster had been boiling steadily over a slowfire since morning, but such was his power of resistancethat his shape was as firm and handsome inthe pot as on the first moment when he was loweredinto it.\\n\\n 　　\"He ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to give up!\" said Alice, peeringnervously under the cover, \"and he looks like ascarecrow.\"\"We\u0027ll see whether he gives up or not when Itake a sharp knife to him,\" her mother answered;\"and as to his looks, a platter full o\u0027 gravy makesa sight o\u0027 difference with old roosters, and I\u0027ll putdumplings round the aidge; they\u0027re turrible fillin\u0027,though they don\u0027t belong with boiled chicken.\"The rooster did indeed make an impressive showing,lying in his border of dumplings, and the dishwas much complimented when it was borne in byAlice. This was fortunate, as the chorus of admirationceased abruptly when the ladies began to eatthe fowl.\\n\\n 　　\"I was glad you could git over to Huldy\u0027sgraduation, Delia,\" said Mrs. Meserve, who sat at thefoot of the table and helped the chicken while Mrs.\\n\\n 　　Robinson poured coffee at the other end. She wasa fit mother for Huldah, being much the most stylishperson in Riverboro; ill health and dress were,indeed, her two chief enjoyments in life. It wasrumored that her elaborately curled \"front piece\"had cost five dollars, and that it was sent into Portlandtwice a year to be dressed and frizzed; butit is extremely difficult to discover the precise factsin such cases, and a conscientious historian alwaysprefers to warn a too credulous reader againstimbibing as gospel truth something that might bethe basest perversion of it. As to Mrs. Meserve\u0027sappearance, have you ever, in earlier years, soughtthe comforting society of the cook and hung overthe kitchen table while she rolled out sugargingerbread? Perhaps then, in some unaccustomedmoment of amiability, she made you a dough lady,cutting the outline deftly with her pastry knife, andthen, at last, placing the human stamp upon it bysticking in two black currants for eyes. Just call tomind the face of that sugar gingerbread lady andyou will have an exact portrait of Huldah\u0027s mother,--Mis\u0027 Peter Meserve, she was generally called,there being several others.\\n\\n 　　\"How\u0027d you like Huldy\u0027s dress, Delia?\" sheasked, snapping the elastic in her black jet braceletsafter an irritating fashion she had.\\n\\n 　　\"I thought it was about the handsomest of any,\"answered Delia; \"and her composition was firstrate. It was the only real amusin\u0027 one there was,and she read it so loud and clear we didn\u0027t missany of it; most o\u0027 the girls spoke as if they hadhasty pudtin\u0027 in their mouths.\"\"That was the composition she wrote for AdamLadd\u0027s prize,\" explained Mrs. Meserve, \"and theydo say she\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 come out first, \u0027stead o\u0027 fourth,if her subject had been dif\u0027rent. There was threeministers and three deacons on the committee, andit was only natural they should choose a seriouspiece; hers was too lively to suit \u0027em.\"Huldah\u0027s inspiring theme had been Boys, and shecertainly had a fund of knowledge and experiencethat fitted her to write most intelligently upon it. Itwas vastly popular with the audience, who enjoyedthe rather cheap jokes and allusions with which itcoruscated; but judged from a purely literary standpoint,it left much to be desired.\\n\\n 　　\"Rebecca\u0027s piece wan\u0027t read out loud, but theone that took the boy\u0027s prize was; why was that?\"asked Mrs. Robinson.\\n\\n 　　\"Because she wan\u0027t graduatin\u0027,\" explained Mrs.\\n\\n 　　Cobb, \"and couldn\u0027t take part in the exercises;it\u0027ll be printed, with Herbert Dunn\u0027s, in the schoolpaper.\"\"I\u0027m glad o\u0027 that, for I\u0027ll never believe it wasbetter \u0027n Huldy\u0027s till I read it with my own eyes;it seems as if the prize ought to \u0027a\u0027 gone to one ofthe seniors.\"\"Well, no, Marthy, not if Ladd offered it to anyof the two upper classes that wanted to try for it,\"argued Mrs. Robinson. \"They say they asked himto give out the prizes, and he refused, up and down.\\n\\n 　　It seems odd, his bein\u0027 so rich and travelin\u0027 aboutall over the country, that he was too modest to gitup on that platform.\"\"My Huldy could \u0027a\u0027 done it, and not winked aneyelash,\" observed Mrs. Meserve complacently; aremark which there seemed no disposition on thepart of any of the company to controvert.\\n\\n 　　\"It was complete, though, the governor happeningto be there to see his niece graduate,\" said DeliaWeeks. \"Land! he looked elegant! They say he\u0027sonly six feet, but he might \u0027a\u0027 been sixteen, and hecertainly did make a fine speech.\"\"Did you notice Rebecca, how white she was,and how she trembled when she and Herbert Dunnstood there while the governor was praisin\u0027 \u0027em?\\n\\n 　　He\u0027d read her composition, too, for he wrote theSawyer girls a letter about it.\" This remark wasfrom the sympathetic Mrs. Cobb.\\n\\n 　　\"I thought \u0027t was kind o\u0027 foolish, his makin\u0027 somuch of her when it wan\u0027t her graduation,\"objected Mrs. Meserve; \"layin\u0027 his hand on her head\u0027n\u0027 all that, as if he was a Pope pronouncin\u0027 benediction.\\n\\n 　　But there! I\u0027m glad the prize come to Riverboro\u0027t any rate, and a han\u0027somer one never wasgive out from the Wareham platform. I guess thereain\u0027t no end to Adam Ladd\u0027s money. The fifty dollarswould \u0027a\u0027 been good enough, but he must needsgo and put it into those elegant purses.\"\"I set so fur back I couldn\u0027t see \u0027em fairly,\"complained Delia, \"and now Rebecca has takenhers home to show her mother.\"\"It was kind of a gold net bag with a chain,\" saidMrs. Perkins, \"and there was five ten-dollar goldpieces in it. Herbert Dunn\u0027s was put in a fineleather wallet.\"\"How long is Rebecca goin\u0027 to stay at the farm?\"asked Delia.\\n\\n 　　\"Till they get over Hannah\u0027s bein\u0027 married, andget the house to runnin\u0027 without her,\" answeredMrs. Perkins. \"It seems as if Hannah might \u0027a\u0027\\n\\n 　　waited a little longer. Aurelia was set against hergoin\u0027 away while Rebecca was at school, but she\u0027sobstinate as a mule, Hannah is, and she just tookher own way in spite of her mother. She\u0027s beendoin\u0027 her sewin\u0027 for a year; the awfullest coarsecotton cloth she had, but she\u0027s nearly blinded herselfwith fine stitchin\u0027 and rufflin\u0027 and tuckin\u0027. Didyou hear about the quilt she made? It\u0027s white, andhas a big bunch o\u0027 grapes in the centre, quilted bya thimble top. Then there\u0027s a row of circle-borderin\u0027\\n\\n 　　round the grapes, and she done them the sizeof a spool. The next border was done with a sherryglass, and the last with a port glass, an\u0027 all outsideo\u0027 that was solid stitchin\u0027 done in straight rows;she\u0027s goin\u0027 to exhibit it at the county fair.\"\"She\u0027d better \u0027a\u0027 been takin\u0027 in sewin\u0027 and earnin\u0027\\n\\n 　　money, \u0027stead o\u0027 blindin\u0027 her eyes on such foolishnessas quilted counterpanes,\" said Mrs. Cobb.\\n\\n 　　\"The next thing you know that mortgage will beforeclosed on Mis\u0027 Randall, and she and the childrenwon\u0027t have a roof over their heads.\"\"Don\u0027t they say there\u0027s a good chance of therailroad goin\u0027 through her place?\" asked Mrs.\\n\\n 　　Robinson. \"If it does, she\u0027ll git as much as the farmis worth and more. Adam Ladd \u0027s one of the stockholders,and everything is a success he takes holtof. They\u0027re fightin\u0027 it in Augusty, but I\u0027d backLadd agin any o\u0027 them legislaters if he thought hewas in the right.\"\"Rebecca\u0027ll have some new clothes now,\" saidDelia, \"and the land knows she needs \u0027em. Seemsto me the Sawyer girls are gittin\u0027 turrible near!\"\"Rebecca won\u0027t have any new clothes out o\u0027 theprize money,\" remarked Mrs. Perkins, \"for she sentit away the next day to pay the interest on thatmortgage.\"\"Poor little girl!\" exclaimed Delia Weeks.\\n\\n 　　\"She might as well help along her folks as spendit on foolishness,\" affirmed Mrs. Robinson. \"I thinkshe was mighty lucky to git it to pay the interestwith, but she\u0027s probably like all the Randalls; itwas easy come, easy go, with them.\"\"That\u0027s more than could be said of the Sawyerstock,\" retorted Mrs. Perkins; \"seems like theyenjoyed savin\u0027 more\u0027n anything in the world, andit\u0027s gainin\u0027 on Mirandy sence her shock.\"\"I don\u0027t believe it was a shock; it stands toreason she\u0027d never \u0027a\u0027 got up after it and been sosmart as she is now; we had three o\u0027 the worstshocks in our family that there ever was on thisriver, and I know every symptom of \u0027em better\u0027nthe doctors.\" And Mrs. Peter Meserve shook herhead wisely.\\n\\n 　　\"Mirandy \u0027s smart enough,\" said Mrs. Cobb,\"but you notice she stays right to home, and she\u0027smore close-mouthed than ever she was; never tooka mite o\u0027 pride in the prize, as I could see, thoughit pretty nigh drove Jeremiah out o\u0027 his senses. Ithought I should \u0027a\u0027 died o\u0027 shame when he cried`Hooray!\u0027 and swung his straw hat when the governorshook hands with Rebecca. It\u0027s lucky hecouldn\u0027t get fur into the church and had to standback by the door, for as it was, he made a spectacleof himself. My suspicion is\"--and here every ladystopped eating and sat up straight--\"that theSawyer girls have lost money. They don\u0027t know athing about business \u0027n\u0027 never did, and Mirandy\u0027stoo secretive and contrairy to ask advice.\"\"The most o\u0027 what they\u0027ve got is in gov\u0027mentbonds, I always heard, and you can\u0027t lose moneyon them. Jane had the timber land left her, an\u0027\\n\\n 　　Mirandy had the brick house. She probably tookit awful hard that Rebecca\u0027s fifty dollars had to beswallowed up in a mortgage, \u0027stead of goin\u0027 towardsschool expenses. The more I think of it, the moreI think Adam Ladd intended Rebecca should havethat prize when he gave it.\" The mind of Huldah\u0027smother ran towards the idea that her daughter\u0027srights had been assailed.\\n\\n 　　\"Land, Marthy, what foolishness you talk!\"exclaimed Mrs. Perkins; \"you don\u0027t suppose hecould tell what composition the committee wasgoing to choose; and why should he offer anotherfifty dollars for a boy\u0027s prize, if he wan\u0027t interestedin helpin\u0027 along the school? He\u0027s give Emma Janeabout the same present as Rebecca every Christmasfor five years; that\u0027s the way he does.\"\"Some time he\u0027ll forget one of \u0027em and give tothe other, or drop \u0027em both and give to some newgirl!\" said Delia Weeks, with an experience bornof fifty years of spinsterhood.\\n\\n 　　\"Like as not,\" assented Mrs. Peter Meserve,\"though it\u0027s easy to see he ain\u0027t the marryin\u0027 kind.\\n\\n 　　There\u0027s men that would marry once a year if theirwives would die fast enough, and there\u0027s men thatseems to want to live alone.\"\"If Ladd was a Mormon, I guess he could haveevery woman in North Riverboro that\u0027s a suitableage, accordin\u0027 to what my cousins say,\" remarkedMrs. Perkins.\\n\\n 　　\"\u0027T ain\u0027t likely he could be ketched by any NorthRiverboro girl,\" demurred Mrs. Robinson; \"notwhen he prob\u0027bly has had the pick o\u0027 Boston. Iguess Marthy hit it when she said there\u0027s menthat ain\u0027t the marryin\u0027 kind.\"\"I wouldn\u0027t trust any of \u0027em when Miss Rightcomes along!\" laughed Mrs. Cobb genially. \"Younever can tell what \u0027n\u0027 who \u0027s goin\u0027 to please \u0027em.\\n\\n 　　You know Jeremiah\u0027s contrairy horse, Buster? Hewon\u0027t let anybody put the bit into his mouth if hecan help it. He\u0027ll fight Jerry, and fight me, till hehas to give in. Rebecca didn\u0027t know nothin\u0027 abouthis tricks, and the other day she went int\u0027 thebarn to hitch up. I followed right along, knowingshe\u0027d have trouble with the headstall, and I declareif she wan\u0027t pattin\u0027 Buster\u0027s nose and talkin\u0027 tohim, and when she put her little fingers into hismouth he opened it so fur I thought he\u0027d swallerher, for sure. He jest smacked his lips over the bitas if \u0027t was a lump o\u0027 sugar. `Land, Rebecca,\u0027 Isays, `how\u0027d you persuade him to take the bit?\u0027\\n\\n 　　`I didn\u0027t,\u0027 she says, `he seemed to want it; perhapshe\u0027s tired of his stall and wants to get out inthe fresh air.\u0027\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/521/375.html","bookId":693,"book":{"id":693,"title":"Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm","description":"简介： Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm is a classic American 1903 children\u0027s novel by Kate Douglas Wiggin that tells the story of Rebecca Rowena Randall and her two stern aunts in the village of Riverboro, Maine.
