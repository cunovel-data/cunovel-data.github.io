{"id":28986,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3 A Difference In Hearts","content":"I don\u0027 know as I cal\u0027lated to be the makin\u0027 of anychild,\" Miranda had said as she folded Aurelia\u0027sletter and laid it in the light-stand drawer.\n 　　\"I s\u0027posed, of course, Aurelia would send us theone we asked for, but it\u0027s just like her to palm offthat wild young one on somebody else.\"\"You remember we said that Rebecca or evenJenny might come, in case Hannah couldn\u0027t,\"interposed Jane.\n 　　\"I know we did, but we hadn\u0027t any notion it wouldturn out that way,\" grumbled Miranda.\n 　　\"She was a mite of a thing when we saw herthree years ago,\" ventured Jane; \"she\u0027s had timeto improve.\"\"And time to grow worse!\"\"Won\u0027t it be kind of a privilege to put her on theright track?\" asked Jane timidly.\n 　　\"I don\u0027 know about the privilege part; it\u0027ll beconsiderable of a chore, I guess. If her mother hain\u0027tgot her on the right track by now, she won\u0027t take toit herself all of a sudden.\"This depressed and depressing frame of mind hadlasted until the eventful day dawned on which Rebeccawas to arrive.\n 　　\"If she makes as much work after she comes asshe has before, we might as well give up hope ofever gettin\u0027 any rest,\" sighed Miranda as she hungthe dish towels on the barberry bushes at the sidedoor.\n 　　\"But we should have had to clean house, Rebeccaor no Rebecca,\" urged Jane; \"and I can\u0027t see whyyou\u0027ve scrubbed and washed and baked as you havefor that one child, nor why you\u0027ve about bought outWatson\u0027s stock of dry goods.\"\"I know Aurelia if you don\u0027t,\" respondedMiranda. \"I\u0027ve seen her house, and I\u0027ve seen thatbatch o\u0027 children, wearin\u0027 one another\u0027s clothes andnever carin\u0027 whether they had \u0027em on right sid\u0027 outor not; I know what they\u0027ve had to live and dresson, and so do you. That child will like as not comehere with a passel o\u0027 things borrowed from therest o\u0027 the family. She\u0027ll have Hannah\u0027s shoes andJohn\u0027s undershirts and Mark\u0027s socks most likely.\n 　　I suppose she never had a thimble on her finger inher life, but she\u0027ll know the feelin\u0027 o\u0027 one beforeshe\u0027s ben here many days. I\u0027ve bought a piece ofunbleached muslin and a piece o\u0027 brown ginghamfor her to make up; that\u0027ll keep her busy. Ofcourse she won\u0027t pick up anything after herself; sheprobably never see a duster, and she\u0027ll be as hardto train into our ways as if she was a heathen.\"\"She\u0027ll make a dif\u0027rence,\" acknowledged Jane,\"but she may turn out more biddable \u0027n we think.\"\"She\u0027ll mind when she\u0027s spoken to, biddable ornot,\" remarked Miranda with a shake of the lasttowel.\n 　　Miranda Sawyer had a heart, of course, but shehad never used it for any other purpose than thepumping and circulating of blood. She was just,conscientious, economical, industrious; a regularattendant at church and Sunday-school, and a memberof the State Missionary and Bible societies, butin the presence of all these chilly virtues you longedfor one warm little fault, or lacking that, one likablefailing, something to make you sure she wasthoroughly alive. She had never had any educationother than that of the neighborhood district school,for her desires and ambitions had all pointed to themanagement of the house, the farm, and the dairy.\n 　　Jane, on the other hand, had gone to an academy,and also to a boarding-school for young ladies; sohad Aurelia; and after all the years that had elapsedthere was still a slight difference in language andin manner between the elder and the two youngersisters.\n 　　Jane, too, had had the inestimable advantage of asorrow; not the natural grief at the loss of her agedfather and mother, for she had been content to letthem go; but something far deeper. She was engagedto marry young Tom Carter, who had nothingto marry on, it is true, but who was sure to have,some time or other. Then the war broke out. Tomenlisted at the first call. Up to that time Jane hadloved him with a quiet, friendly sort of affection, andhad given her country a mild emotion of the samesort. But the strife, the danger, the anxiety of thetime, set new currents of feeling in motion. Life becamesomething other than the three meals a day,the round of cooking, washing, sewing, and churchgoing. Personal gossip vanished from the villageconversation. Big things took the place of triflingones,--sacred sorrows of wives and mothers, pangsof fathers and husbands, self-denials, sympathies,new desire to bear one another\u0027s burdens. Menand women grew fast in those days of the nation\u0027strouble and danger, and Jane awoke from the vaguedull dream she had hitherto called life to new hopes,new fears, new purposes. Then after a year\u0027s anxiety,a year when one never looked in the newspaperwithout dread and sickness of suspense, camethe telegram saying that Tom was wounded; andwithout so much as asking Miranda\u0027s leave, shepacked her trunk and started for the South. Shewas in time to hold Tom\u0027s hand through hours ofpain; to show him for once the heart of a prim NewEngland girl when it is ablaze with love and grief;to put her arms about him so that he could have ahome to die in, and that was all;--all, but it served.\n 　　It carried her through weary months of nursing--nursing of other soldiers for Tom\u0027s dear sake; itsent her home a better woman; and though she hadnever left Riverboro in all the years that lay between,and had grown into the counterfeit presentment ofher sister and of all other thin, spare, New Englandspinsters, it was something of a counterfeit, andunderneath was still the faint echo of that wild heart-beat of her girlhood. Having learned the trick ofbeating and loving and suffering, the poor faithfulheart persisted, although it lived on memoriesand carried on its sentimental operations mostly insecret.\n 　　\"You\u0027re soft, Jane,\" said Miranda once; \"youallers was soft, and you allers will be. If \u0027t wa\u0027n\u0027tfor me keeping you stiffened up, I b\u0027lieve you\u0027dleak out o\u0027 the house into the dooryard.\"It was already past the appointed hour for Mr.\n 　　Cobb and his coach to be lumbering down thestreet.\n 　　\"The stage ought to be here,\" said Miranda,glancing nervously at the tall clock for the twentiethtime. \"I guess everything \u0027s done. I\u0027vetacked up two thick towels back of her washstandand put a mat under her slop-jar; but children areawful hard on furniture. I expect we sha\u0027n\u0027t knowthis house a year from now.\"Jane\u0027s frame of mind was naturally depressedand timorous, having been affected by Miranda\u0027sgloomy presages of evil to come. The only differencebetween the sisters in this matter was thatwhile Miranda only wondered how they could endureRebecca, Jane had flashes of inspiration inwhich she wondered how Rebecca would endurethem. It was in one of these flashes that she ranup the back stairs to put a vase of apple blossomsand a red tomato-pincushion on Rebecca\u0027s bureau.\n 　　The stage rumbled to the side door of the brickhouse, and Mr. Cobb handed Rebecca out like areal lady passenger. She alighted with greatcircumspection, put the bunch of faded flowers in heraunt Miranda\u0027s hand, and received her salute; itcould hardly be called a kiss without injuring thefair name of that commodity.\n 　　\"You needn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 bothered to bring flowers,\"remarked that gracious and tactful lady; \"the garden\u0027s always full of \u0027em here when it comes time.\"Jane then kissed Rebecca, giving a somewhatbetter imitation of the real thing than her sister.\n 　　\"Put the trunk in the entry, Jeremiah, and we\u0027llget it carried upstairs this afternoon,\" she said.\n 　　\"I\u0027ll take it up for ye now, if ye say the word,girls.\"\"No, no; don\u0027t leave the horses; somebody\u0027llbe comin\u0027 past, and we can call \u0027em in.\"\"Well, good-by, Rebecca; good-day, Mirandy \u0027n\u0027\n 　　Jane. You\u0027ve got a lively little girl there. I guessshe\u0027ll be a first-rate company keeper.\"Miss Sawyer shuddered openly at the adjective\"lively\" as applied to a child; her belief being thatthough children might be seen, if absolutely necessary,they certainly should never be heard if shecould help it. \"We\u0027re not much used to noise, Janeand me,\" she remarked acidly.\n 　　Mr. Cobb saw that he had taken the wrong tack,but he was too unused to argument to explain himselfreadily, so he drove away, trying to think bywhat safer word than \"lively\" he might havedescribed his interesting little passenger.\n 　　\"I\u0027ll take you up and show you your room,Rebecca,\" Miss Miranda said. \"Shut the mosquitonettin\u0027 door tight behind you, so \u0027s to keep the fliesout; it ain\u0027t flytime yet, but I want you to startright; take your passel along with ye and then youwon\u0027t have to come down for it; always make yourhead save your heels. Rub your feet on that braidedrug; hang your hat and cape in the entry there asyou go past.\"\"It\u0027s my best hat,\" said Rebecca\"Take it upstairs then and put it in the clothes-press; but I shouldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 thought you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 wornyour best hat on the stage.\"\"It\u0027s my only hat,\" explained Rebecca. \"Myeveryday hat wasn\u0027t good enough to bring. Fanny\u0027sgoing to finish it.\"\"Lay your parasol in the entry closet.\"\"Do you mind if I keep it in my room, please?\n 　　It always seems safer.\"\"There ain\u0027t any thieves hereabouts, and if therewas, I guess they wouldn\u0027t make for your sunshade,but come along. Remember to always go up theback way; we don\u0027t use the front stairs on accounto\u0027 the carpet; take care o\u0027 the turn and don\u0027t ketchyour foot; look to your right and go in. Whenyou\u0027ve washed your face and hands and brushedyour hair you can come down, and by and bywe\u0027ll unpack your trunk and get you settled beforesupper. Ain\u0027t you got your dress on hind sid\u0027 foremost?\"Rebecca drew her chin down and looked at therow of smoked pearl buttons running up and downthe middle of her flat little chest.\n 　　\"Hind side foremost? Oh, I see! No, that\u0027s allright. If you have seven children you can\u0027t keepbuttonin\u0027 and unbuttonin\u0027 \u0027em all the time--theyhave to do themselves. We\u0027re always buttoned upin front at our house. Mira\u0027s only three, but she\u0027sbuttoned up in front, too.\"Miranda said nothing as she closed the door, buther looks were at once equivalent to and moreeloquent than words.\n 　　Rebecca stood perfectly still in the centre of thefloor and looked about her. There was a square ofoilcloth in front of each article of furniture and adrawn-in rug beside the single four poster, whichwas covered with a fringed white dimity counterpane.\n 　　Everything was as neat as wax, but the ceilingswere much higher than Rebecca was accustomed to.\n 　　It was a north room, and the window, which waslong and narrow, looked out on the back buildingsand the barn.\n 　　It was not the room, which was far more comfortablethan Rebecca\u0027s own at the farm, nor the lackof view, nor yet the long journey, for she was notconscious of weariness; it was not the fear of astrange place, for she loved new places and courtednew sensations; it was because of some curiousblending of uncomprehended emotions that Rebeccastood her sunshade in the corner, tore off her besthat, flung it on the bureau with the porcupine quillson the under side, and stripping down the dimityspread, precipitated herself into the middle of thebed and pulled the counterpane over her head.\n 　　In a moment the door opened quietly. Knockingwas a refinement quite unknown in Riverboro, andif it had been heard of would never have beenwasted on a child.\n 　　Miss Miranda entered, and as her eye wanderedabout the vacant room, it fell upon a white andtempestuous ocean of counterpane, an ocean breakinginto strange movements of wave and crest and billow.\n 　　\"REBECCA!\"The tone in which the word was voiced gave it allthe effect of having been shouted from the housetopsA dark ruffled head and two frightened eyesappeared above the dimity spread.\n 　　\"What are you layin\u0027 on your good bed in thedaytime for, messin\u0027 up the feathers, and dirtyin\u0027\n 　　the pillers with your dusty boots?\"Rebecca rose guiltily. There seemed no excuseto make. Her offense was beyond explanation orapology.\n 　　\"I\u0027m sorry, aunt Mirandy--something cameover me; I don\u0027t know what.\"\"Well, if it comes over you very soon again we\u0027llhave to find out what \u0027t is. Spread your bed upsmooth this minute, for \u0027Bijah Flagg \u0027s bringin\u0027 yourtrunk upstairs, and I wouldn\u0027t let him see such acluttered-up room for anything; he\u0027d tell it all overtown.\"When Mr. Cobb had put up his horses that nighthe carried a kitchen chair to the side of his wife,who was sitting on the back porch.\n 　　\"I brought a little Randall girl down on thestage from Maplewood to-day, mother. She\u0027s kin tothe Sawyer girls an\u0027 is goin\u0027 to live with \u0027em,\" hesaid, as he sat down and began to whittle. \"She\u0027sthat Aurelia\u0027s child, the one that ran away withSusan Randall\u0027s son just before we come here tolive.\"\"How old a child?\"\"\u0027Bout ten, or somewhere along there, an\u0027 smallfor her age; but land! she might be a hundred tohear her talk! She kep\u0027 me jumpin\u0027 tryin\u0027 to an-swer her! Of all the queer children I ever comeacross she\u0027s the queerest. She ain\u0027t no beauty--her face is all eyes; but if she ever grows up tothem eyes an\u0027 fills out a little she\u0027ll make folksstare. Land, mother! I wish \u0027t you could \u0027a\u0027 heardher talk.\"\"I don\u0027t see what she had to talk about, a childlike that, to a stranger,\" replied Mrs. Cobb.\n 　　\"Stranger or no stranger, \u0027t wouldn\u0027t make nodifference to her. She\u0027d talk to a pump or a grind-stun; she\u0027d talk to herself ruther \u0027n keep still.\"\"What did she talk about?\"\"Blamed if I can repeat any of it. She kep\u0027 meso surprised I didn\u0027t have my wits about me. Shehad a little pink sunshade--it kind o\u0027 looked like adoll\u0027s amberill, \u0027n\u0027 she clung to it like a burr to awoolen stockin\u0027. I advised her to open it up--thesun was so hot; but she said no, \u0027t would fade, an\u0027\n 　　she tucked it under her dress. `It\u0027s the dearestthing in life to me,\u0027 says she, `but it\u0027s a dreadfulcare.\u0027 Them \u0027s the very words, an\u0027 it\u0027s all the wordsI remember. `It\u0027s the dearest thing in life to me, butit\u0027s an awful care!\u0027 \"--here Mr. Cobb laughed aloudas he tipped his chair back against the side of thehouse. \"There was another thing, but I can\u0027t getit right exactly. She was talkin\u0027 \u0027bout the circusparade an\u0027 the snake charmer in a gold chariot, an\u0027\n 　　says she, `She was so beautiful beyond compare,Mr. Cobb, that it made you have lumps in yourthroat to look at her.\u0027 She\u0027ll be comin\u0027 over tosee you, mother, an\u0027 you can size her up foryourself. I don\u0027 know how she\u0027ll git on with MirandySawyer--poor little soul!\"This doubt was more or less openly expressed inRiverboro, which, however, had two opinions on thesubject; one that it was a most generous thing inthe Sawyer girls to take one of Aurelia\u0027s childrento educate, the other that the education would bebought at a price wholly out of proportion to itsintrinsic value.\n 　　Rebecca\u0027s first letters to her mother would seemto indicate that she cordially coincided with thelatter view of the situation.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/521/352.html","bookId":693,"book":{"id":693,"title":"Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm","description":"简介： Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm is a classic American 1903 children\u0027s novel by Kate Douglas Wiggin that tells the story of Rebecca Rowena Randall and her two stern aunts in the village of Riverboro, Maine.
