{"id":28984,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1 ＂We Are Seven＂","content":"　　The old stage coach was rumbling alongthe dusty road that runs from Maplewoodto Riverboro. The day was as warmas midsummer, though it was only the middle ofMay, and Mr. Jeremiah Cobb was favoring thehorses as much as possible, yet never losing sightof the fact that he carried the mail. The hills weremany, and the reins lay loosely in his hands as helolled back in his seat and extended one foot andleg luxuriously over the dashboard. His brimmedhat of worn felt was well pulled over his eyes, andhe revolved a quid of tobacco in his left cheek. 　　There was one passenger in the coach,--a smalldark-haired person in a glossy buff calico dress. 　　She was so slender and so stiffly starched thatshe slid from space to space on the leather cushions,though she braced herself against the middleseat with her feet and extended her cotton-glovedhands on each side, in order to maintain some sortof balance. Whenever the wheels sank farther thanusual into a rut, or jolted suddenly over a stone,she bounded involuntarily into the air, came downagain, pushed back her funny little straw hat, andpicked up or settled more firmly a small pink sunshade, which seemed to be her chief responsibility,--unless we except a bead purse, into whichshe looked whenever the condition of the roadswould permit, finding great apparent satisfactionin that its precious contents neither disappearednor grew less. Mr. Cobb guessed nothing of theseharassing details of travel, his business being tocarry people to their destinations, not, necessarily,to make them comfortable on the way. Indeed hehad forgotten the very existence of this oneunnoteworthy little passenger. 　　When he was about to leave the post-office inMaplewood that morning, a woman had alightedfrom a wagon, and coming up to him, inquiredwhether this were the Riverboro stage, and if hewere Mr. Cobb. Being answered in the affirmative,she nodded to a child who was eagerly waitingfor the answer, and who ran towards her as if shefeared to be a moment too late. The child mighthave been ten or eleven years old perhaps, butwhatever the number of her summers, she had anair of being small for her age. Her mother helpedher into the stage coach, deposited a bundle anda bouquet of lilacs beside her, superintended the\"roping on\" behind of an old hair trunk, and finallypaid the fare, counting out the silver with greatcare. 　　\"I want you should take her to my sisters\u0027 　　in Riverboro,\" she said. \"Do you know Mi-randy and Jane Sawyer? They live in the brickhouse.\"Lord bless your soul, he knew \u0027em as well asif he\u0027d made \u0027em! 　　\"Well, she\u0027s going there, and they\u0027re expectingher. Will you keep an eye on her, please? If shecan get out anywhere and get with folks, or getanybody in to keep her company, she\u0027ll do it. 　　Good-by, Rebecca; try not to get into any mischief,and sit quiet, so you\u0027ll look neat an\u0027 nice whenyou get there. Don\u0027t be any trouble to Mr. Cobb. 　　--You see, she\u0027s kind of excited.--We came onthe cars from Temperance yesterday, slept all nightat my cousin\u0027s, and drove from her house--eightmiles it is--this morning.\"\"Good-by, mother, don\u0027t worry; you know itisn\u0027t as if I hadn\u0027t traveled before.\"The woman gave a short sardonic laugh and saidin an explanatory way to Mr. Cobb, \"She\u0027s been toWareham and stayed over night; that isn\u0027t muchto be journey-proud on!\"\"It WAS TRAVELING, mother,\" said the childeagerly and willfully. \"It was leaving the farm, andputting up lunch in a basket, and a little ridingand a little steam cars, and we carried our nightgowns.\"\"Don\u0027t tell the whole village about it, if we did,\"said the mother, interrupting the reminiscences ofthis experienced voyager. \"Haven\u0027t I told youbefore,\" she whispered, in a last attempt atdiscipline, \"that you shouldn\u0027t talk about nightgowns and stockings and--things like that, in aloud tone of voice, and especially when there\u0027smen folks round?\"\"I know, mother, I know, and I won\u0027t. All Iwant to say is\"--here Mr. Cobb gave a cluck,slapped the reins, and the horses started sedatelyon their daily task--\"all I want to say is that itis a journey when\"--the stage was really underway now and Rebecca had to put her head out ofthe window over the door in order to finish hersentence--\"it IS a journey when you carry anightgown!\"The objectionable word, uttered in a high treble,floated back to the offended ears of Mrs. Randall,who watched the stage out of sight, gathered upher packages from the bench at the store door,and stepped into the wagon that had been standingat the hitching-post. As she turned the horse\u0027shead towards home she rose to her feet for amoment, and shading her eyes with her hand, lookedat a cloud of dust in the dim distance. 　　\"Mirandy\u0027ll have her hands full, I guess,\" shesaid to herself; \"but I shouldn\u0027t wonder if it wouldbe the making of Rebecca.\"All this had been half an hour ago, and the sun,the heat, the dust, the contemplation of errands tobe done in the great metropolis of Milltown, hadlulled Mr. Cobb\u0027s never active mind into completeoblivion as to his promise of keeping an eye onRebecca. 　　Suddenly he heard a small voice above the rattleand rumble of the wheels and the creaking of theharness. At first he thought it was a cricket, a treetoad, or a bird, but having determined the directionfrom which it came, he turned his head over hisshoulder and saw a small shape hanging as far outof the window as safety would allow. A long blackbraid of hair swung with the motion of the coach;the child held her hat in one hand and with theother made ineffectual attempts to stab the driverwith her microscopic sunshade. 　　\"Please let me speak!\" she called. 　　Mr. Cobb drew up the horses obediently. 　　\"Does it cost any more to ride up there withyou?\" she asked. \"It\u0027s so slippery and shiny downhere, and the stage is so much too big for me, thatI rattle round in it till I\u0027m \u0027most black and blue. 　　And the windows are so small I can only see piecesof things, and I\u0027ve \u0027most broken my neck stretchinground to find out whether my trunk has fallenoff the back. It\u0027s my mother\u0027s trunk, and she\u0027svery choice of it.\"Mr. Cobb waited until this flow of conversation,or more properly speaking this flood of criticism,had ceased, and then said jocularly:--\"You can come up if you want to; there ain\u0027tno extry charge to sit side o\u0027 me.\" Whereupon hehelped her out, \"boosted\" her up to the front seat,and resumed his own place. 　　Rebecca sat down carefully, smoothing her dressunder her with painstaking precision, and puttingher sunshade under its extended folds between thedriver and herself. This done she pushed back herhat, pulled up her darned white cotton gloves, andsaid delightedly:--\"Oh! this is better! This is like traveling! Iam a real passenger now, and down there I felt likeour setting hen when we shut her up in a coop. Ihope we have a long, long ways to go?\"\"Oh! we\u0027ve only just started on it,\" Mr. Cobbresponded genially; \"it\u0027s more \u0027n two hours.\"\"Only two hours,\" she sighed \"That will behalf past one; mother will be at cousin Ann\u0027s, thechildren at home will have had their dinner, andHannah cleared all away. I have some lunch,because mother said it would be a bad beginning to getto the brick house hungry and have aunt Mirandyhave to get me something to eat the first thing.--It\u0027s a good growing day, isn\u0027t it?\"\"It is, certain; too hot, most. Why don\u0027t youput up your parasol?\"She extended her dress still farther over thearticle in question as she said, \"Oh dear no! I neverput it up when the sun shines; pink fades awfully,you know, and I only carry it to meetin\u0027 cloudySundays; sometimes the sun comes out all of asudden, and I have a dreadful time covering it up;it\u0027s the dearest thing in life to me, but it\u0027s an awfulcare.\"At this moment the thought gradually permeatedMr. Jeremiah Cobb\u0027s slow-moving mind that thebird perched by his side was a bird of very differentfeather from those to which he was accustomed inhis daily drives. He put the whip back in its socket,took his foot from the dashboard, pushed his hatback, blew his quid of tobacco into the road, andhaving thus cleared his mental decks for action, he tookhis first good look at the passenger, a look whichshe met with a grave, childlike stare of friendlycuriosity. 　　The buff calico was faded, but scrupulously clean,and starched within an inch of its life. From thelittle standing ruffle at the neck the child\u0027s slenderthroat rose very brown and thin, and the head lookedsmall to bear the weight of dark hair that hung ina thick braid to her waist. She wore an odd littlevizored cap of white leghorn, which may either havebeen the latest thing in children\u0027s hats, or some bitof ancient finery furbished up for the occasion. Itwas trimmed with a twist of buff ribbon and a clusterof black and orange porcupine quills, which hungor bristled stiffly over one ear, giving her thequaintest and most unusual appearance. Her face waswithout color and sharp in outline. As to features,she must have had the usual number, though Mr. 　　Cobb\u0027s attention never proceeded so far as nose,forehead, or chin, being caught on the way and heldfast by the eyes. Rebecca\u0027s eyes were like faith,--\"the substance of things hoped for, the evidenceof things not seen.\" Under her delicately etchedbrows they glowed like two stars, their dancinglights half hidden in lustrous darkness. Theirglance was eager and full of interest, yet neversatisfied; their steadfast gaze was brilliant andmysterious, and had the effect of looking directly throughthe obvious to something beyond, in the object, inthe landscape, in you. They had never beenaccounted for, Rebecca\u0027s eyes. The school teacherand the minister at Temperance had tried andfailed; the young artist who came for the summerto sketch the red barn, the ruined mill, and thebridge ended by giving up all these local beautiesand devoting herself to the face of a child,--asmall, plain face illuminated by a pair of eyes carryingsuch messages, such suggestions, such hints ofsleeping power and insight, that one never tired oflooking into their shining depths, nor of fancyingthat what one saw there was the reflection of one\u0027sown thought. 　　Mr. Cobb made none of these generalizations;his remark to his wife that night was simply to theeffect that whenever the child looked at him sheknocked him galley-west. 　　\"Miss Ross, a lady that paints, gave me thesunshade,\" said Rebecca, when she had exchangedlooks with Mr. Cobb and learned his face by heart. 　　\"Did you notice the pinked double ruffle and thewhite tip and handle? They\u0027re ivory. The handleis scarred, you see. That\u0027s because Fanny suckedand chewed it in meeting when I wasn\u0027t looking. 　　I\u0027ve never felt the same to Fanny since.\"\"Is Fanny your sister?\"\"She\u0027s one of them.\"\"How many are there of you?\"\"Seven. There\u0027s verses written about sevenchildren:--\"`Quick was the little Maid\u0027s reply,O master! we are seven!\u0027 　　I learned it to speak in school, but the scholarswere hateful and laughed. Hannah is the oldest, Icome next, then John, then Jenny, then Mark, thenFanny, then Mira.\"\"Well, that IS a big family!\"\"Far too big, everybody says,\" replied Rebeccawith an unexpected and thoroughly grown-up candorthat induced Mr. Cobb to murmur, \"I swan!\"and insert more tobacco in his left cheek. 　　\"They\u0027re dear, but such a bother, and cost somuch to feed, you see,\" she rippled on. \"Hannahand I haven\u0027t done anything but put babies to bedat night and take them up in the morning for yearsand years. But it\u0027s finished, that\u0027s one comfort,and we\u0027ll have a lovely time when we\u0027re all grownup and the mortgage is paid off.\"\"All finished? Oh, you mean you\u0027ve comeaway?\"\"No, I mean they\u0027re all over and done with;our family \u0027s finished. Mother says so, and she alwayskeeps her promises. There hasn\u0027t been anysince Mira, and she\u0027s three. She was born theday father died Aunt Miranda wanted Hannahto come to Riverboro instead of me, but mothercouldn\u0027t spare her; she takes hold of houseworkbetter than I do, Hannah does. I told mother lastnight if there was likely to be any more childrenwhile I was away I\u0027d have to be sent for, for whenthere\u0027s a baby it always takes Hannah and meboth, for mother has the cooking and the farm.\"\"Oh, you live on a farm, do ye? Where is it? 　　--near to where you got on?\"\"Near? Why, it must be thousands of miles! 　　We came from Temperance in the cars. Then wedrove a long ways to cousin Ann\u0027s and went to bed. 　　Then we got up and drove ever so far to Maplewood,where the stage was. Our farm is away offfrom everywheres, but our school and meetinghouse is at Temperance, and that\u0027s only two miles. 　　Sitting up here with you is most as good as climbingthe meeting-house steeple. I know a boy who\u0027sbeen up on our steeple. He said the people andcows looked like flies. We haven\u0027t met any peopleyet, but I\u0027m KIND of disappointed in the cows;--they don\u0027t look so little as I hoped they would;still (brightening) they don\u0027t look quite as big asif we were down side of them, do they? Boys alwaysdo the nice splendid things, and girls can onlydo the nasty dull ones that get left over. Theycan\u0027t climb so high, or go so far, or stay out solate, or run so fast, or anything.\"Mr. Cobb wiped his mouth on the back of hishand and gasped. He had a feeling that he was beinghurried from peak to peak of a mountain rangewithout time to take a good breath in between. 　　\"I can\u0027t seem to locate your farm,\" he said,\"though I\u0027ve been to Temperance and used to liveup that way. What\u0027s your folks\u0027 name?\"\"Randall. My mother\u0027s name is Aurelia Randall;our names are Hannah Lucy Randall, RebeccaRowena Randall, John Halifax Randall, JennyLind Randall, Marquis Randall, Fanny EllslerRandall, and Miranda Randall. Mother named halfof us and father the other half, but we didn\u0027t comeout even, so they both thought it would be nice toname Mira after aunt Miranda in Riverboro; theyhoped it might do some good, but it didn\u0027t, and nowwe call her Mira. We are all named after somebodyin particular. Hannah is Hannah at theWindow Binding Shoes, and I am taken out ofIvanhoe; John Halifax was a gentleman in a book;Mark is after his uncle Marquis de Lafayette thatdied a twin. (Twins very often don\u0027t live to growup, and triplets almost never--did you know that,Mr. Cobb?) We don\u0027t call him Marquis, only Mark. 　　Jenny is named for a singer and Fanny for a beautifuldancer, but mother says they\u0027re both misfits, forJenny can\u0027t carry a tune and Fanny\u0027s kind of stiff-legged. Mother would like to call them Jane andFrances and give up their middle names, but shesays it wouldn\u0027t be fair to father. She says wemust always stand up for father, because everythingwas against him, and he wouldn\u0027t have died if hehadn\u0027t had such bad luck. I think that\u0027s all thereis to tell about us,\" she finished seriously. 　　\"Land o\u0027 Liberty! I should think it wasenough,\" ejaculated Mr. Cobb. \"There wa\u0027n\u0027tmany names left when your mother got throughchoosin\u0027! You\u0027ve got a powerful good memory! 　　I guess it ain\u0027t no trouble for you to learn yourlessons, is it?\"\"Not much; the trouble is to get the shoes togo and learn \u0027em. These are spandy new I\u0027ve goton, and they have to last six months. Motheralways says to save my shoes. There don\u0027t seemto be any way of saving shoes but taking \u0027em offand going barefoot; but I can\u0027t do that in Riverborowithout shaming aunt Mirandy. I\u0027m going toschool right along now when I\u0027m living with auntMirandy, and in two years I\u0027m going to the seminaryat Wareham; mother says it ought to be themaking of me! I\u0027m going to be a painter like MissRoss when I get through school. At any rate, that\u0027swhat _I_ think I\u0027m going to be. Mother thinks I\u0027dbetter teach.\"\"Your farm ain\u0027t the old Hobbs place, is it?\"\"No, it\u0027s just Randall\u0027s Farm. At least that\u0027swhat mother calls it. I call it Sunnybrook Farm.\"\"I guess it don\u0027t make no difference what youcall it so long as you know where it is,\" remarkedMr. Cobb sententiously. 　　Rebecca turned the full light of her eyes uponhim reproachfully, almost severely, as she answered:--\"Oh! don\u0027t say that, and be like all the rest! Itdoes make a difference what you call things. WhenI say Randall\u0027s Farm, do you see how it looks?\"\"No, I can\u0027t say I do,\" responded Mr. Cobb uneasily. 　　\"Now when I say Sunnybrook Farm, what doesit make you think of?\"Mr. Cobb felt like a fish removed from his nativeelement and left panting on the sand; there wasno evading the awful responsibility of a reply, forRebecca\u0027s eyes were searchlights, that pierced thefiction of his brain and perceived the bald spot onthe back of his head. 　　\"I s\u0027pose there\u0027s a brook somewheres near it,\"he said timorously. 　　Rebecca looked disappointed but not quite dis-heartened. \"That\u0027s pretty good,\" she saidencouragingly. \"You\u0027re warm but not hot; there\u0027sa brook, but not a common brook. It has youngtrees and baby bushes on each side of it, and it\u0027s ashallow chattering little brook with a white sandybottom and lots of little shiny pebbles. Wheneverthere\u0027s a bit of sunshine the brook catches it, andit\u0027s always full of sparkles the livelong day. 　　Don\u0027t your stomach feel hollow? Mine doest Iwas so \u0027fraid I\u0027d miss the stage I couldn\u0027t eat anybreakfast.\"\"You\u0027d better have your lunch, then. I don\u0027teat nothin\u0027 till I get to Milltown; then I get apiece o\u0027 pie and cup o\u0027 coffee.\"\"I wish I could see Milltown. I suppose it\u0027sbigger and grander even than Wareham; more likeParis? Miss Ross told me about Paris; she boughtmy pink sunshade there and my bead purse. Yousee how it opens with a snap? I\u0027ve twenty centsin it, and it\u0027s got to last three months, for stampsand paper and ink. Mother says aunt Mirandywon\u0027t want to buy things like those when she\u0027sfeeding and clothing me and paying for my schoolbooks.\"\"Paris ain\u0027t no great,\" said Mr. Cobbdisparagingly. \"It\u0027s the dullest place in the State o\u0027 　　Maine. I\u0027ve druv there many a time.\"Again Rebecca was obliged to reprove Mr. Cobb,tacitly and quietly, but none the less surely, thoughthe reproof was dealt with one glance, quickly sentand as quickly withdrawn. 　　\"Paris is the capital of France, and you have togo to it on a boat,\" she said instructively. \"It\u0027s inmy geography, and it says: `The French are a gayand polite people, fond of dancing and light wines.\u0027 　　I asked the teacher what light wines were, and hethought it was something like new cider, or maybeginger pop. I can see Paris as plain as day by justshutting my eyes. The beautiful ladies are alwaysgayly dancing around with pink sunshades andbead purses, and the grand gentlemen are politelydancing and drinking ginger pop. But you can seeMilltown most every day with your eyes wideopen,\" Rebecca said wistfully. 　　\"Milltown ain\u0027t no great, neither,\" replied Mr. 　　Cobb, with the air of having visited all the cities ofthe earth and found them as naught. \"Now youwatch me heave this newspaper right onto Mis\u0027 　　Brown\u0027s doorstep.\"Piff! and the packet landed exactly as it wasintended, on the corn husk mat in front of thescreen door. 　　\"Oh, how splendid that was!\" cried Rebeccawith enthusiasm. \"Just like the knife throwerMark saw at the circus. I wish there was a long,long row of houses each with a corn husk mat anda screen door in the middle, and a newspaper tothrow on every one!\"\"I might fail on some of \u0027em, you know,\" saidMr. Cobb, beaming with modest pride. \"If youraunt Mirandy\u0027ll let you, I\u0027ll take you down toMilltown some day this summer when the stageain\u0027t full.\"A thrill of delicious excitement ran throughRebecca\u0027s frame, from her new shoes up, up to theleghorn cap and down the black braid. She pressedMr. Cobb\u0027s knee ardently and said in a voice chokingwith tears of joy and astonishment, \"Oh, itcan\u0027t be true, it can\u0027t; to think I should seeMilltown. It\u0027s like having a fairy godmother who asksyou your wish and then gives it to you! Did youever read Cinderella, or The Yellow Dwarf, or TheEnchanted Frog, or The Fair One with GoldenLocks?\"\"No,\" said Mr. Cobb cautiously, after a moment\u0027sreflection. \"I don\u0027t seem to think I ever did readjest those partic\u0027lar ones. Where\u0027d you get achance at so much readin\u0027?\"\"Oh, I\u0027ve read lots of books,\" answeredRebecca casually. \"Father\u0027s and Miss Ross\u0027s and allthe dif\u0027rent school teachers\u0027, and all in the Sunday-school library. I\u0027ve read The Lamplighter, andScottish Chiefs, and Ivanhoe, and The Heir ofRedclyffe, and Cora, the Doctor\u0027s Wife, and DavidCopperfield, and The Gold of Chickaree, and Plutarch\u0027sLives, and Thaddeus of Warsaw, and Pilgrim\u0027s Progress,and lots more.--What have you read?\"\"I\u0027ve never happened to read those partic\u0027larbooks; but land! I\u0027ve read a sight in my time! 　　Nowadays I\u0027m so drove I get along with theAlmanac, the Weekly Argus, and the Maine StateAgriculturist.--There\u0027s the river again; this isthe last long hill, and when we get to the top of itwe\u0027ll see the chimbleys of Riverboro in thedistance. \u0027T ain\u0027t fur. I live \u0027bout half a mile beyondthe brick house myself.\"Rebecca\u0027s hand stirred nervously in her lap andshe moved in her seat. \"I didn\u0027t think I was goingto be afraid,\" she said almost under her breath;\"but I guess I am, just a little mite--when yousay it\u0027s coming so near.\"\"Would you go back?\" asked Mr. Cobb curiously. 　　She flashed him an intrepid look and then saidproudly, \"I\u0027d never go back--I might be frightened,but I\u0027d be ashamed to run. Going to auntMirandy\u0027s is like going down cellar in the dark. 　　There might be ogres and giants under the stairs,--but, as I tell Hannah, there MIGHT be elves andfairies and enchanted frogs!--Is there a mainstreet to the village, like that in Wareham?\"\"I s\u0027pose you might call it a main street, an\u0027 　　your aunt Sawyer lives on it, but there ain\u0027t nostores nor mills, an\u0027 it\u0027s an awful one-horsevillage! You have to go \u0027cross the river an\u0027 get onto our side if you want to see anything goin\u0027 on.\"\"I\u0027m almost sorry,\" she sighed, \"because itwould be so grand to drive down a real main street,sitting high up like this behind two splendid horses,with my pink sunshade up, and everybody in townwondering who the bunch of lilacs and the hairtrunk belongs to. It would be just like the beautifullady in the parade. Last summer the circuscame to Temperance, and they had a procession inthe morning. Mother let us all walk in and wheelMira in the baby carriage, because we couldn\u0027tafford to go to the circus in the afternoon. Andthere were lovely horses and animals in cages, andclowns on horseback; and at the very end came alittle red and gold chariot drawn by two ponies, andin it, sitting on a velvet cushion, was the snakecharmer, all dressed in satin and spangles. She wasso beautiful beyond compare, Mr. Cobb, that youhad to swallow lumps in your throat when youlooked at her, and little cold feelings crept up anddown your back. Don\u0027t you know how I mean? 　　Didn\u0027t you ever see anybody that made you feellike that?\"Mr. Cobb was more distinctly uncomfortable atthis moment than he had been at any one timeduring the eventful morning, but he evaded thepoint dexterously by saying, \"There ain\u0027t no harm,as I can see, in our makin\u0027 the grand entry in thebiggest style we can. I\u0027ll take the whip out, setup straight, an\u0027 drive fast; you hold your bo\u0027quetin your lap, an\u0027 open your little red parasol, an\u0027 　　we\u0027ll jest make the natives stare!\"The child\u0027s face was radiant for a moment, butthe glow faded just as quickly as she said, \"I forgot--mother put me inside, and maybe she\u0027d wantme to be there when I got to aunt Mirandy\u0027s. 　　Maybe I\u0027d be more genteel inside, and then Iwouldn\u0027t have to be jumped down and my clothesfly up, but could open the door and step down likea lady passenger. Would you please stop a minute,Mr. Cobb, and let me change?\"The stage driver good-naturedly pulled up hishorses, lifted the excited little creature down, openedthe door, and helped her in, putting the lilacs andthe pink sunshade beside her. 　　\"We\u0027ve had a great trip,\" he said, \"and we\u0027vegot real well acquainted, haven\u0027t we?--You won\u0027tforget about Milltown?\"\"Never!\" she exclaimed fervently; \"and you\u0027resure you won\u0027t, either?\"\"Never! Cross my heart!\" vowed Mr. Cobbsolemnly, as he remounted his perch; and as thestage rumbled down the village street between thegreen maples, those who looked from their windowssaw a little brown elf in buff calico sitting primlyon the back seat holding a great bouquet tightly inone hand and a pink parasol in the other. Had theybeen farsighted enough they might have seen, whenthe stage turned into the side dooryard of the oldbrick house, a calico yoke rising and fallingtempestuously over the beating heart beneath, the redcolor coming and going in two pale cheeks, and amist of tears swimming in two brilliant dark eyes. 　　Rebecca\u0027s journey had ended. 　　\"There\u0027s the stage turnin\u0027 into the Sawyergirls\u0027 dooryard,\" said Mrs. Perkins to her husband. 　　\"That must be the niece from up Temperance way. 　　It seems they wrote to Aurelia and invited Hannah,the oldest, but Aurelia said she could spare Rebeccabetter, if \u0027t was all the same to Mirandy \u0027n\u0027 Jane;so it\u0027s Rebecca that\u0027s come. She\u0027ll be goodcomp\u0027ny for our Emma Jane, but I don\u0027t believethey\u0027ll keep her three months! She looks blackas an Injun what I can see of her; black and kindof up-an-comin\u0027. They used to say that one o\u0027 theRandalls married a Spanish woman, somebodythat was teachin\u0027 music and languages at a boardin\u0027 　　school. Lorenzo was dark complected, you remember,and this child is, too. Well, I don\u0027t know asSpanish blood is any real disgrace, not if it\u0027s a goodways back and the woman was respectable.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/521/350.html","bookId":693,"book":{"id":693,"title":"Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm","description":"简介： Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm is a classic American 1903 children\u0027s novel by Kate Douglas Wiggin that tells the story of Rebecca Rowena Randall and her two stern aunts in the village of Riverboro, Maine.
