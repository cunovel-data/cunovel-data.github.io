{"id":39003,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"It was morning. Sergeant Kerfoot Harriman, bearing with proud satisfaction the learning and culture he had acquired in the course of three years at a small Middle-Western university, walked down the Rue de Dieu in a manner which carried the suggestion that he had forgotten the belt of his breeches. Approaching a white two-story stone building which age and an occasional long-distance German shell had given an air of solemn decrepitude, Sergeant Harriman unbent enough to shout stiltedly: “Mailo! Mailo-ho!” His reiterated announcement was unnecessary. Already half-dressed soldiers were rushing through the entrance of the building and toward the approaching sergeant. “All right, you men. If you can’t appear in uniform get off of the company street.” Sergeant Harriman was commanding. In their eagerness to hear the list of names called out the men forgot even to grumble, but scrambled back through the doorway overflowing the long hall off of which were six rooms,[11] devoid of furniture, which had been converted into barracks. Sergeant Harriman, feeling the entire amount of pleasure to be had from the added importance of distributing the mail—the first the platoon had received in two months—cleared his throat, took a steadfast position and gave his attention to the small bundle of letters which he held in his hand. He deftly riffled them twice without speaking. Then he separated the letters belonging to the non-commissioned officers, the corporals, and sergeants from those addressed to the privates. The non-commissioned officers received their letters first. At last: “Private Hicks,” he read off. “Here, here I am. Back here.” Private Hicks was all aflutter. Separated from the letter by a crowd of men, he stood on tiptoe and reached his arm far over the shoulder of the man in front of him. “Pass it back to him? Pass it back to him?” voices impatiently asked. “No!” Sergeant Harriman was a commander, every inch of him. “Come up and get it, Hicks.” [12] “Hey, snap out of it, will ya! Call off the rest of the names.” A path was made, and Hicks finally received the letter. Harriman looked up. “If you men don’t shut up, you will never get your mail!” “Private Pugh!” “Hee-ah. Gimme that lettah. That’s f’m mah sweet mammah.” Pugh wormed his small, skinny body through the men, fretfully calling at those who did not make way quickly enough. He grasped the letter. Then he started back, putting the letter in his pocket unopened. “Poor old Pugh. Gets a letter and he can’t read.” “Ain’t that a waste of stationery?” “Why don’t you ask the captain to write an’ tell your folks not to send you any more mail? Look at all the trouble you cause these mail clerks.” Several men offered to read the letter to Pugh, but he did not answer. An hour later the first sergeant was walking up and down in front of the billets, blowing his whistle. Bugle-calls were taboo. “Shake it up, you men. Don’t you know[13] you’re supposed to be ready for drill at nine o’clock?” “Drill! I thought we come up here to fight,” voices grumbled, muttering obscene phrases directed at General Pershing, the company commander, and the first sergeant. Men scurried out of their billets, struggling to get on their packs and to fall in line before the roll was called. “Fall in!” the little sergeant shouted, standing before the platoon. “Right dress!” he commanded sharply and ran to the right of the platoon, from where he told one man to draw in his waist and another to move his feet, and so on, until he was satisfied that the line was reasonably straight. “Steady, front!” And in a very military manner he placed himself in the proper place before the company and began to call the roll. “All present or accounted for, sir,” he reported to the captain, a note of pride and of a great deed nobly done ringing in his voice. The sergeants fell back in rear of the platoons and the commander ordered “squads right.” The hobnailed boots of the men on the cobblestones echoed hollowly down the street. Stupid-looking old Frenchmen, a few thick-waisted[14] women, and a scattering of ragged children dully watched the company march down the street. For the most part they were living in the advance area because they had no other place to go and because they feared to leave the only homes that they had ever known. The platoon marched out of the town along a gravel road and into a green, evenly plotted field, where they were deployed and where, to their surprise, a number of sacks, filled with straw, had been hung from a row of scaffolding. The platoon faced the sacks, were man?uvred so that each man would be standing in front of one of the dummies and were ordered to fix bayonets. Sergeant Harriman, the nostrils of his stubby nose flaring wide with zeal, began his instructions. “All right, you men. Now you want to forget that these are sacks of straw. They are not at all. They are dirty Huns—Huns that raped the Belgians, Huns that would have come over to the good old U. S. A. and raped our women if we hadn’t got into the war. Now, men, I want to see some action, I want to see some hate when you stick these dirty Huns. I want to see how hard you can grunt.” [15] “All ready now. Straight thrust. One, two, three—now——” As a body the platoon lunged their bayonets into the cloth-covered straw. “Great God! Is that all the pep you’ve got? Why, you men are stale. What the hell did you come over here to fight for? Did you ever hear that you were supposed to be saving the world for democracy? Now, try it again, and put some punch in it this time. Let’s hear your grunt.” The action was repeated. “Rotten!” yelled the sergeant. “What the hell are you going to do when you get up to the front? Do you think this is an afternoon tea? You act like a bunch of ribbon-counter clerks, and that’s what I believe most of you are. Now let’s try the butt stroke.” “Butt stroke. One—two—three. Oh, hell. Where are you aiming, Gillespie? Remember, you’ve missed him with the bayonet and you’re trying to soak him in the crotch—in the crotch, mind you, with the butt of your rifle.” Several of the men caught the frenzy of the sergeant, and at each command they ran, gritting and grinding their teeth, and grunted at[16] the pieces of straw. From the terrific onslaught one of the dummies was severed from the scaffold, and the sergeant cried out: “That’s the first real spirit I’ve seen to-day. That’s the way to kill them!” he called to the man who had wrested the dummy from its place. “Come up here and show these dopes how to kill.” Exultant, the man left his place and strutted over to the sergeant. Taking a position before one of the dummies, he proceeded to show the rest of the platoon how really and frightfully to stab the dummies until their stuffing broke through the sacks. “He’s working to be a corporal, the dirty scut. And oh, if he does get to be a two-striper won’t he make us step around. Boy!” Hicks muttered to Pugh, who was standing next to him and whose bayonet had failed even to pierce the covering of the sack. “He won’t pull none of that old stuff on me. Ah’ll tell Lieutenant Bedford and he’ll make him be good or I won’t give him any more money to gamble with,” Pugh drawled. “You sure have got a stand-in with Bedford, Pugh. I often wondered how you did it.” “Hell, that’s easy. When he was down at[17] St. Nazaire I lent him ’bout a thousand francs to gamble with, and he ain’t never paid me.” The platoon assembled and marched back to their billets. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2861/79063.html","bookId":1191,"book":{"id":1191,"title":"Through the Wheat","description":"简介： Dusk, like soft blue smoke, fell with the dying spring air and settled upon the northern French village.
