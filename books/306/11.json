{"id":9317,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"Resealing the cellar, they carried the box back to Jason\u0027s new office. Only after spraying with decontaminant, did they examine it closely. Meta picked out engraved letters on the lid. \"S. T. POLLUX VICTORY--that must be the name of the spacer this log came from. But I don\u0027t recognize the class, or whatever it is the initials S. T. stand for.\" \"Stellar Transport,\" Jason told her, as he tried the lock mechanism. \"I\u0027ve heard of them but I\u0027ve never seen one. They were built during the last wave of galactic expansion. Really nothing more than gigantic metal containers, put together in space. After they were loaded with people, machinery and supplies, they would be towed to whatever planetary system had been chosen. These same tugs and one-shot rockets would brake the S. T.\u0027s in for a landing. Then leave them there. The hull was a ready source of metal and the colonists could start right in building their new world. And they were big. All of them held at least fifty thousand people ...\" Only after he said it, did he realize the significance of his words. Meta\u0027s deadly stare drove it home. There were now less people on Pyrrus than had been in the original settlement. And human population, without rigid birth controls, usually increased geometrically. Jason dinAlt suddenly remembered Meta\u0027s itchy trigger finger. \"But we can\u0027t be sure how many people were aboard this one,\" he said hurriedly. \"Or even if this is the log of the ship that settled Pyrrus. Can you find something to pry this open with? The lock is corroded into a single lump.\" Meta took her anger out on the box. Her fingers managed to force a gap between lid and bottom. She wrenched at it. Rusty metal screeched and tore. The lid came off in her hands and a heavy book thudded to the table. The cover legend destroyed all doubt. LOG OF S. T. POLLUX VICTORY. OUTWARD BOUND--SETANI TO PYRRUS. 55,000 SETTLERS ABOARD. Meta couldn\u0027t argue now. She stood behind Jason with tight-clenched fists and read over his shoulder as he turned the brittle, yellowed pages. He quickly skipped through the opening part that covered the sailing preparations and trip out. Only when he had reached the actual landing did he start reading slowly. The impact of the ancient words leaped out at him. \"Here it is,\" Jason shouted. \"Proof positive that we\u0027re on the right trail. Even you will have to admit that. Read it, right here.\" _... Second day since the tugs left, we are completely on our own now. The settlers still haven\u0027t grown used to this planet, though we have orientation talks every night. As well as the morale agents who I have working twenty hours a day. I suppose I really can\u0027t blame the people, they all lived in the underways of Setani and I doubt if they saw the sun once a year. This planet has weather with a vengeance, worse than anything I\u0027ve seen on a hundred other planets. Was I wrong during the original planning stages not to insist on settlers from one of the agrarian worlds? People who could handle the outdoors. These citified Setanians are afraid to go out in the rain. But of course they have adapted completely to their native 1.5 gravity so the two gee here doesn\u0027t bother them much. That was the factor that decided us. Anyway--too late now to do anything about it. Or about the unending cycle of rain, snow, hail, hurricanes and such. Answer will be to start the mines going, sell the metals and build completely enclosed cities. The only thing on this forsaken planet that isn\u0027t actually against us are the animals. A few large predators at first, but the guards made short work of them. The rest of the wild life leaves us alone. Glad of that! They have been fighting for existence so long that I have never seen a more deadly looking collection. Even the little rodents no bigger than a man\u0027s hand are armored like tanks ... \"I don\u0027t believe a word of it,\" Meta broke in. \"That can\u0027t be Pyrrus he\u0027s writing about ...\" Her words died away as Jason wordlessly pointed to the title on the cover. He continued scanning the pages, flipping them quickly. A sentence caught his eye and he stopped. Jamming his finger against the place, he read aloud. \"\u0027... And troubles keep piling up. First Har Palo with his theory that the vulcanism is so close to the surface that the ground keeps warm and the crops grow so well. Even if he is right--what can we do? We must be self-dependent if we intend to survive. And now this other thing. It seems that the forest fire drove a lot of new species our way. Animals, insects and even birds have attacked the people. (Note for Har: check if possible seasonal migration might explain attacks.) There have been fourteen deaths from wounds and poisoning. We\u0027ll have to enforce the rules for insect lotion at all times. And I suppose build some kind of perimeter defense to keep the larger beasts out of the camp.\u0027 \"This is a beginning,\" Jason said. \"At least now we are aware of the real nature of the battle we\u0027re engaged in. It doesn\u0027t make Pyrrus any easier to handle, or make the life forms less dangerous, to know that they were once better disposed towards mankind. All this does is point the way. Something took the peaceful life forms, shook them up, and turned this planet into one big deathtrap for mankind. That something is what I want to uncover.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/465/1037.html","bookId":306,"book":{"id":306,"title":"Deathworld","description":"简介： Deathworld is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett\u0027s Discworld series and a parody of several other personifications of death.
