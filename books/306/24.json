{"id":9330,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"There were few coherent memories of the ride. Some things stood out sharply like the spaceship-sized lump of burning scoria that had plunged into a lake near them, showering the line with hot drops of water. But mostly it was just a seemingly endless ride, with Jason still too weak to care much about it. By dawn the danger area was behind them and the march had slowed to a walk. The animals had vanished as the quake was left behind, going their own ways, still in silent armistice. The peace of mutually shared danger was over, Jason found that out when they stopped to rest and eat. He and Rhes went to sit on the soft grass, near a fallen tree. A wild dog had arrived there first. It lay under the log, muscles tensed, the ruddy morning light striking a red glint from its eyes. Rhes faced it, not three meters away, without moving a muscle. He made no attempt to reach one of his weapons or to call for help. Jason stood still as well, hoping the Pyrran knew what he was doing. With no warning at all the dog sprang straight at them. Jason fell backwards as Rhes pushed him aside. The Pyrran dropped at the same time--only now his hand held the long knife, yanked from the sheath strapped to his thigh. With unseen speed the knife came up, the dog twisted in midair, trying to bite it. Instead it sank in behind the dog\u0027s forelegs, the beast\u0027s own weight tearing a deadly gaping wound the length of its body. It was still alive when it hit the ground, but Rhes was astraddle it, pulling back the bony-plated head to cut the soft throat underneath. The Pyrran carefully cleaned his knife on the dead animal\u0027s fur, then returned it to the sheath. \"They\u0027re usually no trouble,\" he said quietly, \"but it was excited. Probably lost the rest of the pack in the quake.\" His actions were the direct opposite of the city Pyrrans. He had not looked for trouble nor started the fight. Instead he had avoided it as long as he could. But when the beast charged it had been neatly and efficiently dispatched. Now, instead of gloating over his victory, he seemed troubled over an unnecessary death. It made sense. Everything on Pyrrus made sense. Now he knew how the deadly planetary battle had started--and he knew how it could be ended. All the deaths had not been in vain. Each one had helped him along the road a little more towards the final destination. There was just one final thing to be done. Rhes was watching him now, and he knew they shared the same thoughts. \"Explain yourself,\" Rhes said. \"What did you mean when you said we could wipe out the junkmen and get our freedom?\" Jason didn\u0027t bother to correct the misquote, it was best they consider him a hundred per cent on their side. \"Get the others together and I\u0027ll tell you. I particularly want to see Naxa and any other talkers who are here.\" * * * * * They gathered quickly when the word was passed. All of them knew that the junkman had been killed to save this off-worlder, that their hope of salvation lay with him. Jason looked at the crowd of faces turned towards him and reached for the right words to tell them what had to be done. It didn\u0027t help to know that many of them would be killed doing it. \"The small star ship can\u0027t be used,\" he said. \"You all saw that it was ruined beyond repair. But that was the easy way out. The hard way is still left. Though some of you may die, in the long run it will be the best solution. \"We are going to invade the city, break through the perimeter. I know how it can be done ...\" A mutter of sound spread across the crowd. Some of them looked excited, happy with the thought of killing their hereditary enemies. Others stared at Jason as if he were mad. A few were dazed at the magnitude of the thought, this carrying of the battle to the stronghold of the heavily armed enemy. They quieted when Jason raised his hand. \"I know it sounds impossible,\" he said. \"But let me explain. Something must be done--and now is the time to do it. The situation can only get worse from now on. The city Pyrr ... the junkmen can get along without your food, their concentrates taste awful but they sustain life. But they are going to turn against you in every way they can. No more metals for your tools or replacements for your electronic equipment. Their hatred will probably make them seek out your farms and destroy them from the ship. All of this won\u0027t be comfortable--and there will be worse to come. In the city they are losing their war against this planet. Each year there are less of them, and some day they will all be dead. Knowing how they feel I am sure they will destroy their ship first, and the entire planet as well, if that is possible.\" \"How can we stop them?\" someone called out. \"By hitting now,\" Jason answered. \"I know all the details of the city and I know how the defenses are set up. Their perimeter is designed to protect them from animal life, but we could break through it if we were really determined.\" \"What good would that do?\" Rhes snapped. \"We crack the perimeter and they draw back--then counter-attack in force. How can we stand against their weapons?\" \"We won\u0027t have to. Their spaceport touches the perimeter, and I know the exact spot where the ship stands. That is the place where we will break through. There is no formal guard on the ship and only a few people in the area. We will capture the ship. Whether we can fly it or not is unimportant. Who controls the ship controls Pyrrus. Once there we threaten to destroy it if they don\u0027t meet our terms. They have the choice of mass suicide or co-operation. I hope they have the brains to co-operate.\" His words shocked them into silence for an instant, then they surged into a wave of sound. There was no agreement, just excitement, and Rhes finally brought them to order. \"Quiet!\" he shouted. \"Wait until Jason finishes before you decide. We still haven\u0027t heard how this proposed invasion is to be accomplished.\" \"The plan I have depends on the talkers.\" Jason said. \"Is Naxa there?\" He waited until the fur-wrapped man had pushed to the front. \"I want to know more about the talkers, Naxa. I know you can speak to doryms and the dogs here--but what about the wild animals? Can you make them do what you want?\" \"They\u0027re animals ... course we can talk t\u0027them. Th\u0027more talkers, th\u0027more power. Make \u0027em do just what we want.\" \"Then the attack will work,\" Jason said excitedly. \"Could you get your talkers all on one side of the city--the opposite side from the spaceport--and stir the animals up? Make them attack the perimeter?\" \"Could we!\" Naxa shouted, carried away by the idea. \"We\u0027d bring in animals from all over, start th\u0027biggest attack they ev\u0027r saw!\" \"Then that\u0027s it. Your talkers will launch the attack on the far side of the perimeter. If you keep out of sight, the guards will have no idea that it is anything more than an animal attack. I\u0027ve seen how they work. As an attack mounts they call for reserves inside the city and drain men away from the other parts of the perimeter. At the height of the battle, when they have all their forces committed across the city, I\u0027ll lead the attack that will break through and capture the ship. That\u0027s the plan and it\u0027s going to work.\" Jason sat down then, half fell down, drained of strength. He lay and listened as the debate went back and forth, Rhes ordering it and keeping it going. Difficulties were raised and eliminated. No one could find a basic fault with the plan. There were plenty of flaws in it, things that might go wrong, but Jason didn\u0027t mention them. These people wanted his idea to work and they were going to make it work. It finally broke up and they moved away. Rhes came over to Jason. \"The basics are settled,\" he said. \"All here are in agreement. They are spreading the word by messenger to all the talkers. The talkers are the heart of the attack, and the more we have, the better it will go off. We don\u0027t dare use the screens to call them, there is a good chance that the junkmen can intercept our messages. It will take five days before we are ready to go ahead.\" \"I\u0027ll need all of that time if I\u0027m to be any good,\" Jason said. \"Now let\u0027s get some rest.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/465/1050.html","bookId":306,"book":{"id":306,"title":"Deathworld","description":"简介： Deathworld is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett\u0027s Discworld series and a parody of several other personifications of death.
