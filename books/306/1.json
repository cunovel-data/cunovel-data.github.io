{"id":9307,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"Some planet in the galaxy must--by definition--be the toughest, meanest, nastiest of all. If Pyrrus wasn\u0027t it ... it was an awfully good approximation! Jason dinAlt sprawled in soft luxury on the couch, a large frosty stein held limply in one hand. His other hand rested casually on a pillow. The gun behind the pillow was within easy reach of his fingers. In his line of work he never took chances. It was all highly suspicious. Jason didn\u0027t know a soul on this planet. Yet the card sent by service tube from the hotel desk had read: Kerk Pyrrus would like to see Jason dinAlt. Blunt and to the point. He signaled the desk to send the man up, then lowered his fingers a bit until they brushed the gun butt. The door slid open and his visitor stepped through. A retired wrestler. That was Jason\u0027s first thought. Kerk Pyrrus was a gray-haired rock of a man. His body seemingly chiseled out of flat slabs of muscle. Then Jason saw the gun strapped to the inside of the other man\u0027s forearm, and he let his fingers drop casually behind the pillow. \"I\u0027d appreciate it,\" Jason said, \"if you\u0027d take off your gun while you\u0027re in here.\" The other man stopped and scowled down at the gun as if he was seeing it for the first time. \"No, I never take it off.\" He seemed mildly annoyed by the suggestion. Jason had his fingers on his own gun when he said, \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll have to insist. I always feel a little uncomfortable around people who wear guns.\" He kept talking to distract attention while he pulled out his gun. Fast and smooth. He could have been moving in slow motion for all the difference it made. Kerk Pyrrus stood rock still while the gun came out, while it swung in his direction. Not until the very last instant did he act. When he did, the motion wasn\u0027t visible. First his gun was in the arm holster--then it was aimed between Jason\u0027s eyes. It was an ugly, heavy weapon with a pitted front orifice that showed plenty of use. And Jason knew if he swung his own weapon up a fraction of an inch more he would be dead. He dropped his arm carefully and Kerk flipped his own gun back in the holster with the same ease he had drawn it. \"Now,\" the stranger said, \"if we\u0027re through playing, let\u0027s get down to business. I have a proposition for you.\" Jason downed a large mouthful from the mug and bridled his temper. He was fast with a gun--his life had depended on it more than once--and this was the first time he had been outdrawn. It was the offhand, unimportant manner it had been done that irritated him. \"I\u0027m not prepared to do business,\" he said acidly. \"I\u0027ve come to Cassylia for a vacation, get away from work.\" \"Let\u0027s not fool each other, dinAlt,\" Kerk said impatiently. \"You\u0027ve never worked at an honest job in your entire life. You\u0027re a professional gambler and that\u0027s why I\u0027m here to see you.\" Jason forced down his anger and threw the gun to the other end of the couch so he wouldn\u0027t be tempted to commit suicide. He had hoped no one knew him on Cassylia and was looking forward to a big kill at the Casino. He would worry about that later. This weight-lifter type seemed to know all the answers. Let him plot the course for a while and see where it led. \"All right, what do you want?\" * * * * * Kerk dropped into a chair that creaked ominously under his weight, and dug an envelope out of one pocket. He flipped through it quickly and dropped a handful of gleaming Galactic Exchange notes onto the table. Jason glanced at them--then sat up suddenly. \"What are they--forgeries?\" he asked, holding one up to the light. \"They\u0027re real enough,\" Kerk told him, \"I picked them up at the bank. Exactly twenty-seven bills--or twenty-seven million credits. I want you to use them as a bankroll when you go to the Casino tonight. Gamble with them and win.\" They looked real enough--and they could be checked. Jason fingered them thoughtfully while he examined the other man. \"I don\u0027t know what you have in mind,\" he said. \"But you realize I can\u0027t make any guarantees. I gamble--but I don\u0027t always win ...\" \"You gamble--and you win when you want to,\" Kerk said grimly. \"We looked into that quite carefully before I came to you.\" \"If you mean to say that I cheat--\" Carefully, Jason grabbed his temper again and held it down. There was no future in getting annoyed. Kerk continued in the same level voice, ignoring Jason\u0027s growing anger. \"Maybe you don\u0027t call it cheating, frankly I don\u0027t care. As far as I\u0027m concerned you could have your suit lined with aces and electromagnets in your boots. As long as you won. I\u0027m not here to discuss moral points with you. I said I had a proposition. \"We have worked hard for that money--but it still isn\u0027t enough. To be precise, we need three billion credits. The only way to get that sum is by gambling--with these twenty-seven million as bankroll.\" \"And what do I get out of it?\" Jason asked the question coolly, as if any bit of the fantastic proposition made sense. \"Everything above the three billion you can keep, that should be fair enough. You\u0027re not risking your own money, but you stand to make enough to keep you for life if you win.\" \"And if I lose--?\" Kerk thought for a moment, not liking the taste of the idea. \"Yes--there is the chance you might lose, I hadn\u0027t thought about that.\" He reached a decision. \"If you lose--well I suppose that is just a risk we will have to take. Though I think I would kill you then. The ones who died to get the twenty-seven million deserve at least that.\" He said it quietly, without malice, and it was more of a promise than a threat. Stamping to his feet Jason refilled his stein and offered one to Kerk who took it with a nod of thanks. He paced back and forth, unable to sit. The whole proposition made him angry--yet at the same time had a fatal fascination. He was a gambler and this talk was like the taste of drugs to an addict. Stopping suddenly, he realized that his mind had been made up for some time. Win or lose--live or die--how could he say no to the chance to gamble with money like that! He turned suddenly and jabbed his finger at the big man in the chair. \"I\u0027ll do it--you probably knew I would from the time you came in here. There are some terms of my own, though. I want to know who you are, and who they are you keep talking about. And where did the money come from. Is it stolen?\" Kerk drained his own stein and pushed it away from him. \"Stolen money? No, quite the opposite. Two years\u0027 work mining and refining ore to get it. It was mined on Pyrrus and sold here on Cassylia. You can check on that very easily. I sold it. I\u0027m the Pyrric ambassador to this planet.\" He smiled at the thought. \"Not that that means much, I\u0027m ambassador to at least six other planets as well. Comes in handy when you want to do business.\" Jason looked at the muscular man with his gray hair and worn, military-cut clothes, and decided not to laugh. You heard of strange things out in the frontier planets and every word could be true. He had never heard of Pyrrus either, though that didn\u0027t mean anything. There were over thirty-thousand known planets in the inhabited universe. \"I\u0027ll check on what you have told me,\" Jason said. \"If it\u0027s true, we can do business. Call me tomorrow--\" \"No,\" Kerk said. \"The money has to be won tonight. I\u0027ve already issued a check for this twenty-seven million, it will bounce as high as the Pleiades unless we deposit the money in the morning, so that\u0027s our time limit.\" With each moment the whole affair became more fantastic--and more intriguing for Jason. He looked at his watch. There was still enough time to find out if Kerk was lying or not. \"All right, we\u0027ll do it tonight,\" he said. \"Only I\u0027ll have to have one of those bills to check.\" Kerk stood up to go. \"Take them all, I won\u0027t be seeing you again until after you\u0027ve won. I\u0027ll be at the Casino of course, but don\u0027t recognize me. It would be much better if they didn\u0027t know where your money was coming from or how much you had.\" Then he was gone, after a bone-crushing handclasp that closed on Jason\u0027s hand like vise jaws. Jason was alone with the money. Fanning the bills out like a hand of cards he stared at their sepia and gold faces, trying to get the reality through his head. Twenty-seven million credits. What was to stop him from just walking out the door with them and vanishing. Nothing really, except his own sense of honor. Kerk Pyrrus, the man with the same last name as the planet he came from, was the universe\u0027s biggest fool. Or he knew just what he was doing. From the way the interview had gone the latter seemed the better bet. \"He knows I would much rather gamble with the money than steal it,\" he said wryly. Slipping a small gun into his waistband holster and pocketing the money he went out.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/465/1027.html","bookId":306,"book":{"id":306,"title":"Deathworld","description":"简介： Deathworld is a fictional character in Terry Pratchett\u0027s Discworld series and a parody of several other personifications of death.
