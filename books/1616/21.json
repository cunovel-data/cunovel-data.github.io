He took the talisman and held it to his lips, eyes not wavering from hers. \"I will come back to you,\" he whispered, and disappeared through the trees. Chapter 15 \"Tom, my good man!\" James boomed, his arms outstretched. \"Come, come! I\u0027ve set aside a dram of the good brandy.\" Hopping up from his seat by a small bonfire, James ducked into his tent for his flask. \"A moment, James…\" Tom hesitated. Peeking back through the canvas flaps, James feigned astonishment. \"Such dire spirits! Don\u0027t you know we\u0027ve won the battle? I understand you fancy yourself more spy than soldier, but even you can\u0027t have missed that we\u0027ve more men left standing than our opponent has, aye?\" He laughed heartily, then added, \"As my emissary, perhaps you\u0027d be so kind as to root out a fine set of clubs. I\u0027d give the links at the Royal Aberdeen a try before returning to Montrose.\" \"James,\" Tom said again, with more surety. \"We\u0027ll not be playing any golf.\" \"What madness is this?\" James asked broadly. The grin on his face slowly dissolved into bewilderment then concern. \"What is it, man? Has something happened to Magda?\" \"No, no, it\u0027s naught to do with the lass. As far as I know, she remains under Napier\u0027s watchful eye.\" Tom scrubbed a hand over his forehead. \"It\u0027s Aberdeen, James. They\u0027ve razed it.\" James stared blankly, so Tom continued. \"After the bridge fell, Leslie and his men disappeared. You\u0027d gone off to salute the Camerons, soldiers were going every which way. It was mayhem all about, James.\" Tom pitched his voice as if to offer consolation, earnestly trying to convince his friend of something. \"You can\u0027t have accounted for every man.\" \"Just tell it,\" James said through clenched teeth. \"What is it you\u0027re telling me?\" \"The general and Campbell, and some of their men… They\u0027ve laid waste, James. Thievery, mostly. But there was some, well… Leslie\u0027s men are savages, many of them.\" \"Och, hell.\" James dropped to the ground, legs crossed, cradling his head in hands. \"The accursed Campbell. Napier warned me, aye? Warned of men drunk on newfound power.\" He ran his hands over his face and through his hair, \"I need to make it right. I\u0027ll not abide barbarism. Releasing a pack of wolves on my own country was never my intention.\" He rose again, solidly to his feet. \"I must go, have an audience with the king himself, make him listen to reason. The fall of his supporters in Aberdeen should have captured Charles\u0027s attention.\" James paced a few steps, and then turned to face his friend. \"I started this madness, Tom, and now I will finish it.\" \"But there\u0027s more,\" Tom said quietly. \"The king and his Catholic wife have divided more than just Scotland. Parliament has risen against him. Charles has fled London and set up a military court in Oxford.\" James was silent for a moment, then said, his voice steady, \"Then it\u0027s to Oxford we go. Now.\" \"You\u0027re mad.\" \"I\u0027ve been told as much.\" \"I cannot come with you this time, James.\" Silence hung between the two men. Just the slow popping of the dwindling fire filled the late afternoon air. \"Aye, I\u0027ve anticipated this day.\" \"What of the lass?\" \"I\u0027ll keep her by me, of course.\" \"You cannot.\" \"And why not?\" His friend had situated himself by the fire, and James stepped closer to stand towering over him. \"The lass has a sound seat on a horse. She\u0027ll make the journey just fine.\" \"Aye, the lass has a pretty seat indeed,\" he said, and James\u0027s glare was deadly in return. \"Listen to reason, man.\" Tom rose to face him. \"It\u0027s been pure good fortune that nothing has befallen her thus far. Think you, what would\u0027ve happened had today\u0027s battle gone the other way? Who would\u0027ve protected her?\" Tom let the thought hang heavy in the air before continuing, \"The battle in Aberdeen has opened a Pandora\u0027s box. Traveling as a stranger, and on the road to England? Men will be on the lookout, and with hatred in their eyes, for any sign of a Covenanter. Others will want vengeance against any Royalist they can find. And then there are those who\u0027ll merely be suspicious of everyone.\" He met his friend\u0027s eye with uncharacteristic challenge. \"And what of you now, James? What of your Covenant now? How would you choose, if you were forced to pick a side?\" He placed his hand on James\u0027s shoulder. \"I know you\u0027ll want the lass in your case,\" he added quietly. \"But for her safety, you must part.\" \"Aye,\" James said finally, his voice ragged. He flinched his shoulder from beneath Tom\u0027s hand. \"I\u0027ll return to Montrose and gather Will Rollo. I\u0027ll need another man at my side.\" Turning his back, he spoke staring into the fire. \"I must leave at once. If I ride through the night, I can be there by dawn. I\u0027ll gather some provisions and head to the land of our king.\" \"She\u0027s not here, lad,\" Napier said, perplexed. James had finally found his brother-in-law in the crofter\u0027s cabin, all its other inhabitants gone to the soldiers \u0027 camp to celebrate the Covenanters\u0027 victory. \"We thought surely you\u0027d be raising a toast to your great triumph by now. She went off and about with the cook. Magda has no shortage of questions for her. I don\u0027t know what manner of missionaries her parents were, but it seems your lass wouldn\u0027t know the difference between sustenance and certain death when it comes to living off the land.\" James only nodded absently, so Napier elaborated, amused by his own story, \"Cook only just stopped her from poisoning us all with a basket full of spindle berries. She finally decided simply to take Magda on one of her foraging walks. I\u0027ve not done wrong to let her alone?\" he asked, sudden panic seizing his voice. \"No, no,\" James replied, his tone distant. His eyes scanned the room once more, as if Magda might somehow magically appear. The single cookpot. A lone cot. Grit and dirt on the cold stone floor. She didn\u0027t belong there, in such an untamed land. How would she survive it? She\u0027d want her museums and grand baths, not spindle berries. She\u0027d want to return to her home. \"You did well.\" James\u0027s voice was rough. He raked a hand through his hair and began again. \"These past days. You did well, tended Magda well. You\u0027ve my thanks. It\u0027s been a great relief to me. But…\" He clasped his hand to Napier\u0027s shoulder. \"I\u0027ve one more favor to ask of you.\" \"You know you have only to ask.\" \"I need to be off. And soon.\" \"Can you not wait for Magda\u0027s return? It can\u0027t be more than a matter of hours.\" \"I have no choice.\" James paused, blinking his eyes shut tight. When he opened them, his gaze was sharp on his brother-in-law. \"I need to leave for Montrose at once. You were right about the Covenanters. It appears we\u0027ve created a many- headed beast. Even now, Campbell razes the town, and the king has lost London to Parliament.\" \"Civil war?\" Napier asked incredulously. \"That is the question, aye? I\u0027m off to Oxford to treat with Charles. Gather what I might about the situation. But Magda…\" Napier nodded, knowing. \"I\u0027d wanted to see her once more…\" His voice trailed off, remembering the vivid green of Magda\u0027s eyes. In them he\u0027d seen the promise of something greater than just a man and a woman lying tangled together. But whatever potential he might feel with this strange, wayward woman, he knew she had to return home. That England was on the brink of civil war only confirmed it. To keep her in his world would only put her life in jeopardy. James inhaled deeply, gathering himself, then focused once more. \"The lass needs help. Return her to Montrose for me, offer her my every hospitality.\" He added somberly, \"Help her find the way home.\" \"Anything, James, of course.\" \"Ask her story. And Napier?\" \"Yes, lad?\" \"I would that you believed her.\" Ignoring the other man\u0027s confusion, he continued, \"Take her to the monastery. My hope is the Black Friars might lend assistance.\" \"Where exactly is the lass from?\" Napier asked uneasily. \"In good time, man, in good time… Ah, one last thing.\" James reached down, and extracting a small knife from the cuff of his boot, he sliced a navy and gold enameled button from his coat. \"Give her this from me,\" he said, pressing the button into Napier\u0027s hand. \"A trifle to remember me. When she finds herself home, I\u0027ll be long dead.\" Chapter 16 James smiled for the first time since Aberdeen. It felt so good to be by Rollo\u0027s side once more. They\u0027d grown up together, and he\u0027d missed the man who\u0027d become like a brother to him. \"Have you need of assistance?\" he asked, seeing Rollo struggle with his saddle. Though a riding accident as a child had damaged his friend\u0027s back and left his legs without much feeling, the near constant spasms had rendered them unusually strong. Sheer determination and grit drove him and, once seated, he was one of the greatest horsemen James knew. \"I\u0027m lame, James,\" he bit out, \"not a half-wit.\" Rollo pulled himself into place, and bending to adjust the thick straps, grumbled, \"I think I am capable of buckling my own leathers.\" He sat up. nodding grimly at James. Will Rollo cut a regal figure, sitting tall on his gray- speckled stallion, an unusual, and pricey, mount for a Scotsman. If it weren\u0027t for so many straps and the extra-high pommel and cantle of his custom saddle, one would never guess the pain and stiffness he suffered. \"I find you cheerful as ever, my dear friend.\" He erupted in laughter, which Rollo answered with a begrudging smile. James inhaled, savoring once again the tang of sea in his throat. Though the coast was at his back, he could feel its distant pulse like the snore of a slumbering monster, and it was something that never ceased to bolster him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sword-of-the-highlands-highlands-2/page-21.html","bookId":1616,"book":{"id":1616,"title":"Sword of the Highlands (Highlands #2)","description":"Storyline: Sword of the Highlands (Highlands #2) One minute, she\u0027s New York heiress and art curator Magda Deacon, enraptured by the Highlander captured in an old portrait.
