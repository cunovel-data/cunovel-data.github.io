Hogmanay has passed, or I\u0027d have wagered he\u0027d some sort of holiday dramatique planned for us.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Magda smiled, amused by the notion of portly Tom in any sort of theatrical endeavor. She brushed out the length of her hair. There was no way she could ever recreate the elaborate style perpetrated upon her by one of the Cameron maids, so down it would have to be. \"He claims to have some news, though he wouldn\u0027t tell any of us till you returned.\"\\n\\n \"News, eh?\" James made his way to the door. \"Well, we\u0027d best go down for dinner where we can hear it, aye?\" His gaze roved down her body. \"I find I\u0027m suddenly quite famished.\"\\n\\n He winked, and she was surprised to find that he was still able to make her cheeks flush red.\\n\\n \"Aye, good man,\" Tom bellowed, already well into his third glass of brandy. \"March south, I tell you. You\u0027ll receive a hero\u0027s greeting.\"\\n\\n Will Rollo was with them, expansive at the thought of traveling once more. \"I\u0027ve heard murmurs that Charles has regained control over Parliament.\"\\n\\n \"Och\"—Ewen glowered—\"whose murmurs?\" Ignoring the young laird, Tom continued, \"I\u0027m told the Lowlands want to rally for you, James. You see\"—he leaned in conspiratorially—\"after chasing you to Oxford and back, I traveled for a fortnight in the border towns.\"\\n\\n \"Forsaking your dramatic career for one as a spy, is it? \" James laughed.\\n\\n \"And why not?\" Tom beamed proudly. \"I had the honor of supping at Traquair House, in Peebles, where I met a number of prominent noblemen.\" His cheeks flushed crimson with his excitement. \"The south is near filled with recruits anxious to take the bit and join you.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, James,\" MacColla chimed in, emphasizing his point by waving the dinner knife in his hand. \"I expect your men have the right of it. Place your humility elsewhere.\" He took a bite of roast venison and spoke as he chewed. \"We\u0027ve trounced the Covenanters up and down these Highlands. No false modesty about it.\"\\n\\n Magda looked down to saw at the hunk of meat on her own plate, biting her lip not to smile. MacColla\u0027s broad personality and manners ranged from startling to amusing. He caught her eye, and gesturing again with his knife, gave her an exaggerated wink.\\n\\n \"\u0027Tis not false modesty, my friend.\" James pushed his plate away. \"\u0027Tis merely good sense. I question all intelligence.\" He picked up his drink. The leaded glass was thick with a slight taper to it, and it felt good and solid in his hand. Swirling his brandy, he eyed the thin ropes of tawny liquid left in its wake. \"Most particularly those reports with such grand estimations of yours truly.\"\\n\\n \"And will you ride south with us?\" Ewen asked of Tom, still wary of his enthusiasm. \"I didn\u0027t see your face when we slept with the snow for a pillow, or ate rabbit tasting of winter\u0027s freeze.\"\\n\\n Tom flushed to be called out so, and sat tall in his seat, inadvertently creating a gap between his breeches and the vest that strained over his belly.\\n\\n \"Easy, Cameron,\" MacColla laughed.\\n\\n \"Have another, lad,\" James said, reaching over to refill Ewen\u0027s glass. \"It will serve you well.\"\\n\\n \"I ken you\u0027re like his family,\" Ewen told Tom. Then the young laird turned to James and added, \"But how can you be certain you\u0027ll be greeted a hero with the word of just one \"—\\n\\n \"Och, enough.\" James slammed his hand on the table. \"I\u0027ll not scour the country in search of accolades. But I do see the wisdom of a southern campaign. And I will continue to rely on Tom for his assistance.\" James looked to his friend. \"If you\u0027re willing, aye? I know you\u0027re no soldier, but I am in want of a trustworthy spy.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s high time for another adventure.\" Tom raised his glass to James. \"I\u0027d not miss the fetes in your honor, my dear Marquis.\"\\n\\n \"I remain ever at your side as well,\" Rollo said gravely.\\n\\n \"And what of you, MacColla?\" Ewen asked. His brandy still sat untouched before him. \"Do you still march with us?\" \"No,\" MacColla replied nonchalantly, picking at the meat in his teeth. \"I head west, not south.\"\\n\\n Startled, James put his glass down hard. \"This is unexpected, Alasdair.\"\\n\\n \"Oho! My Christian name,\" MacColla laughed. \"I must be in your poor graces.\" He pushed back his chair, the wood screeching loud against the stone -flagged floor. \"Aye, James, \u0027tis true.\" He kicked his crossed ankles onto the table with a small nod to Magda as if to beg pardon.\\n\\n \"\u0027Twas a fight against the Campbell that I reckoned on, not a fight for the king, and that is the fight I shall continue to wage. I\u0027ll leave you some number of MacDonald swords, but I take the rest of my men west. To head south with you would be to put Clan Campbell at my back, and I\u0027ll not be sated until the Highland sod is manured with the blood of all Campbells.\"\\n\\n James was silent for a moment, holding MacColla\u0027s gaze. \"So, my friend,\" he finally said, \"farewell it shall be.\" James raised his glass, and with a wistful smile added, \"But first we drink together, to the destruction of an old enemy.\" \"Aye.\" A huge smile split MacColla\u0027s face, and he downed his brandy in one gulp.\\n\\n \"And let\u0027s not forget James,\" Tom said. \"To James, whose military prowess and superlative leadership dogged the Covenanters hither and yon throughout bonny Scotland.\" \"Are you quite done, man?\" Ewen glowered, holding his brandy impatiently.\\n\\n \"And may he finally reap the fruits of his battle cunning,\" Rollo chimed in, over James\u0027s amused protests.\\n\\n Even Ewen laughed then, the men suddenly giddy with drink and triumph.\\n\\n Then James looked to Magda. She\u0027d been sitting silently, turning the glass around and around on the table in front of her. She returned his gaze, anxiety chilling her green eyes, and the smile bled from his face.\\n\\n Chapter 33\\n\\n \"If your troops cannot win this war \"—\\n\\n \"\u0027Tis your leadership we enjoyed at Inverlochy,\" Alexander Leslie snapped, straining for indifference in his voice. \" Our troops would have fared much better had you not stubbornly rushed them through the snow in cloaks and cavalry boots.\"\\n\\n Perspiration beaded above Campbell\u0027s lip, which trembled in anger. He\u0027d summoned the general to Campbell\u0027s primary seat at Inveraray Castle and was anxious to get the man from his sight as quickly as possible. Leslie had been much aggrieved that so many of his soldiers had been killed, and had since tried Campbell to no end.\\n\\n \"Silence,\" Campbell hissed. \"Or your treasonous words will cause that over proud head of yours to be severed from its body.\"\\n\\n Steeling himself, he retrieved a handkerchief from his sleeve and dabbed at his brow. \"If the troops you trained are unable to best the Marquis of Montrose, then I\u0027ll simply put a price on his head. Surely those\"—distaste puckered Campbell\u0027s features—\"Highlanders are as capable of treachery as they are of savagery.\"\\n\\n Forcing the general to wait in attentive silence, Campbell meticulously folded the square of cloth and tucked it away. \"Every man can be bought, Leslie. Find one who will deliver me James Graham.\"\\n\\n Chapter 34\\n\\n \"As I recall,\" James said with a tease in his voice, \"you claimed you dreamt of going on holiday to a warm isle and no horse riding.\" He kicked his mount into a trot. Loch Eil was already at their backs and it wasn\u0027t a long ride now to Loch Ailort where they\u0027d hire a boat, and propelled by the spring tides, head into the Sound of Arisaig to their destination.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Magda said, quickly catching up. \"But this pony counts as a horse, James. You know what I meant.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, aye.\" He leaned far over the saddle and gave a squeeze to her thigh. \"But some riding is necessary, aye? I\u0027ll not have you walking.\"\\n\\n \"But on a pony?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d not entrust my horse to some ferryman,\" James laughed. \"\u0027Tis but a short ride. And I am producing your requested isle.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but I had something more like Hawaii in mind.\"\\n\\n \"Ha—where?\" James stood in his stirrups, eyeing the horizon. The spectacular edge of Scotland was visible in the distance, a glare of white on water with crags beyond, as Loch Ailort snaked its way out to the open sea. \"As for the warmth,\" he added, \"well, we\u0027ve waited till spring and cannot wait any longer. The men are fully rested and we must be on our way. I\u0027d not try Cameron hospitality any longer.\"\\n\\n Magda was greatly relieved to feel the sand at her feet when they finally landed on the Isle of Eigg. James and the captain had gotten out, dragging the boat some ways through the shallows to shore. It hadn\u0027t been much more than a dinghy, and the trip would\u0027ve been an anxious affair even if she hadn\u0027t had the nagging fear of water to contend with. James had made the mistake of telling her whales could often be seen this time of year, and Magda spent much of their crossing envisioning scenarios whereby they were flipped into the sea by a gargantuan, breeching marine mammal.\\n\\n Once her heart returned to its normal rate, though, Magda looked around and was delighted. It was as if a comb had been dragged through a painter\u0027s palette, swirling together but not quite mixing basic shades of blue and beige and brown and red and green, the colors of ocean giving way to sand, beach grasses to mud, then onto the turf that stretched into an impossible shade of emerald in the distance.\\n\\n \"Charming, eh?\" James came up from behind to wrap his arms tightly around her. The sound of gentle waves slapping at the retreating boat already faded in the distance. \"Less than one hundred souls live here. We can go about unhampered.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sword-of-the-highlands-highlands-2/page-45.html","bookId":1616,"book":{"id":1616,"title":"Sword of the Highlands (Highlands #2)","description":"Storyline: Sword of the Highlands (Highlands #2) \\n One minute, she\u0027s New York heiress and art curator Magda Deacon, enraptured by the Highlander captured in an old portrait.
