{"id":43188,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. A NEGATIVE RAILROAD.","content":"We have said that when, unfortunately, we place ourselves at the point of view of the producer\u0027s interest, we cannot fail to clash with the general interest, because the producer, as such, demands only efforts, wants, and obstacles. When the Atlantic and Great Western Railway is finished, the question will arise, \"Should connection be broken at Pittsburg?\" This the Pittsburgers will answer affirmatively, for a multitude of reasons, but for this among others; the railroad from New York to St. Louis ought to have an interruption at Pittsburg, in order that merchandise and travellers compelled to stop in the city may leave in it fees to the hackmen, pedlars, errand-boys, consignees, hotel-keepers, etc. It is clear, that here again the interest of the agent of labor is placed before the interest of the consumer. But if Pittsburg ought to profit by the interruption, and if the profit is conformable with public interest, Harrisburg, Dayton, Indianapolis, Columbus, much more all the intermediate points, ought to demand stoppages, and that in the general interest, in the widely extended interest of national labor, for the more they are multiplied, the more will consignments, commissions, transportations, be multiplied on all points of [121] the line. With this system we arrive at a railroad of successive stoppages, to a negative railroad. Whether the protectionists wish it or not, it is not the less certain that the principle of restriction is the same as the principle of gaps, the sacrifice of the consumers to the producer, of the end to the means. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2884/79809.html","bookId":1144,"book":{"id":1144,"title":"What Is Free Trade?","description":"简介： Years ago I could not rid my mind of the notion that Free Trade meant some cunning policy of British statesmen designed to subject the world to British interests.
