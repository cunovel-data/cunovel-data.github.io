OBSTRUCTED RIVERS PLEAD FOR THE PROHIBITIONISTS.","content":"Some years ago, when the Spanish Cortes were discussing a treaty with Portugal on improving the course of the river Douro, a deputy rose and said, \"If the Douro is turned into a canal, transportation will be made at a much lower price. Portuguese cereals will sell cheaper in Castile, and will make a formidable opposition to our national labor. I oppose the project unless the ministers engage to raise the tariff in such a way as to restore the equilibrium.\" The assembly found the argument unanswerable. Three months later the same question was submitted to the Senate of Portugal. A noble hidalgo said: \"Mr. President, the project is absurd. You post guards, at great expense, on the banks of the Douro, in order to prevent the introduction of Castilian cereals into Portugal, while, at the same time, you would, also, at great expense, facilitate their introduction. This is an inconsistency with which I cannot identify myself. Let the Douro pass on to our sons as our fathers left it to us.\" Now, when it is proposed to alter and confine the course of the Mississippi, we recall the arguments of the Iberian orators, and say to ourselves, if the member from St. Louis was as good an economist as those of Valencia, and the representatives from New Orleans [119] as powerful logicians as those of Oporto, assuredly the Mississippi would be left \"To sleep amid its forests dank and lone,\" for to improve the navigation of the Mississippi will favor the introduction of New Orleans products to the injury of St. Louis, and an inundation of the products of St. Louis to the detriment of New Orleans. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2884/79808.html","bookId":1144,"book":{"id":1144,"title":"What Is Free Trade?","description":"简介： Years ago I could not rid my mind of the notion that Free Trade meant some cunning policy of British statesmen designed to subject the world to British interests.
