{"id":93132,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"THE LIVING They ascended in the cage lift, a contraption of polished brass and lattice wood. Genevieve hesitated outside the apartment, apprehensive for her friend. She held her keys and looked at Kate, wondering how to phrase her concerns. \u0027It\u0027s been several years, hasn\u0027t it?\u0027 she said. \u0027Charles was in his late nineties the last time I saw him,\u0027 said Kate. \u0027He was already old. I shan\u0027t be shocked or upset.\u0027 Genevieve wasn\u0027t so sure. The warm aged and died. She did not. Though she\u0027d had centuries to get used to, it left her often bewildered, blinking back tears. Surely, a whole life couldn\u0027t run past so swiftly. It wasn\u0027t fair. Carmilla Karnstein, a vampire girl Genevieve had known in the eighteenth century, grieved for lost friends as if the warm were her pets, grown suddenly ancient in dog years during the eternity of a human childhood. Carmilla was gone too now. Twice. It had never apparently occurred to her that her favourites wouldn\u0027t have died if she hadn\u0027t been so fond of them that she had to have so much of their blood. That had been the death of her. Treating the warm as pets or cattle was one way elders coped with estrangement from human time. In this century, with so many nosferatu about, things should have changed. But Genevieve worried that she couldn\u0027t change. Evolution was something one\u0027s successors dealt with. Vampires like Kate Reed should tackle those issues. \u0027He\u0027s past a hundred, Kate,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m not so very far off it.\u0027 \u0027You know it\u0027s different for us.\u0027 \u0027Yes. I\u0027m sorry. That was a silly thing to say.\u0027 Genevieve opened the dark-wood double doors. They were nine feet tall, more appropriate for a castle than a flat. Romans liked impressive entrances. \u0027Come in, come in,\u0027 she bustled. Kate stepped over the welcome mat and put her suitcase down. She looked around the foyer, admiring bookcases and brass lamp-fittings. \u0027Very Victorian,\u0027 she said, \u0027very Charles.\u0027 Genevieve kept bowls of dried rose petals, for the scent. \u0027Come through,\u0027 she said, leading Kate around the corner of the passageway, toward the study. The apartment was spacious, but the corridors - and the kitchen and bathroom - were cramped, squeezed into the plan between two large bedrooms, the study, and a dining room. The french windows were open, and evening breeze stirred the curtains. The last of the sunset threw an orange veil over the city. \u0027Charles likes to sit on the balcony,\u0027 Genevieve explained. There was some fussing outside. \u0027Charles-Cheri,\u0027 Genevieve said, quite loudly. \u0027Kate is here.\u0027 She left Kate and stepped out onto the balcony. Charles had managed to turn the bath chair around with slippered feet, but his fingers couldn\u0027t get a grip on the rims of the wheels to move it forward. He was frustrated with the failure of his hands, but more amused than irritated. He accepted frailty as he had always accepted strength, as a comparative thing. Without needing to be asked, she wheeled Charles into the room. Kate waited, eyes watery behind thick glasses, fidgeting with the seam of her tartan skirt. He smiled, and his age-lines stretched. He looked oddly childlike, almost a baby. Kate flew at him and went down on her knees. She took his hands in hers - making him wince with her uncontrolled vampire grip - and laid her head on his lap. \u0027Charles,\u0027 Kate sighed, \u0027Charles.\u0027 Charles managed a coughing laugh. \u0027Stand up and let me look at you,\u0027 he ordered. Genevieve turned on the electric lights. Even after decades, she felt she ought to be reaching for a taper to light the candles. Sometimes, she\u0027d try to twist a light switch as if it were the key of a gas lamp. \u0027I\u0027m not sure that hairstyle is becoming,\u0027 Charles clucked. Kate\u0027s hands went to her exposed neck. \u0027It\u0027s more like a haircut.\u0027 Kate blushed, freckles darkening. She held herself rather awkwardly, refusing to believe she might in a certain light be appealing. Victorians were prejudiced against red hair, so she\u0027d been taught to be ashamed of her looks. Now tastes had changed and she might pass for fashionable. She was petite enough for the New Look. Even spectacles weren\u0027t the disfigurement they\u0027d once been considered. \u0027I had short hair when I was warm,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027It was the fashion. Jeanne d\u0027Arc set it.\u0027 Charles thought about that. \u0027You were one of those girls who passed as a boy to go to sea and become a pirate. Kate is in a more respectable profession.\u0027 \u0027Many would disagree with you, m\u0027darling.\u0027 Kate got off her knees and kissed Charles. Genevieve had a pang. Her nails became fractionally more like claws. Thinking about it, she knew Kate had earned her kiss. She\u0027d been there when Genevieve hadn\u0027t. While Genevieve had avoided the twentieth century, Kate had been a part of it and stuck by Charles through the nightmare years. Kate dabbed her eyes dry with a hankie. \u0027Look,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m crying. You\u0027ll think me a fool.\u0027 \u0027Not at all,\u0027 Charles said, kindly. \u0027Kate has already got mixed up in murder,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027So I\u0027ve been reading.\u0027 Charles indicated the afternoon editions of Il quotidiano and Paese sera. They lay on a kidney-shaped coffee table, the newest piece of furniture in the room. \u0027I had to rescue her from the police.\u0027 \u0027Who\u0027s in charge of the investigation?\u0027 Genevieve looked at Kate. \u0027An Inspector Silvestri,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027Do you know him?\u0027 \u0027I know of him. He\u0027s reckoned a good man. He caught that couple last year, the ones who left bloodied butterfly brooches on the corpses of their victims. Of course, he hasn\u0027t stopped these murders. According to the papers, you saw the Crimson Executioner?\u0027 \u0027Actually, I saw his reflection,\u0027 said Kate. \u0027A fine distinction, but worth making.\u0027 Charles was livelier than Genevieve had seen him for weeks, livelier even than when the British spy was consulting him. She hadn\u0027t known that he took an interest in the murders of vampire elders but it didn\u0027t surprise her. Was he concerned for her safety? He was occasionally solicitous of her, but she had put that down to the fussiness of advanced age. She\u0027d underestimated him. Again. \u0027Counting last night\u0027s, there have been seventeen murders since the liberation,\u0027 Charles told Kate. \u0027All vampire elders. All in Rome, and mostly in public places. Tourist spots, even. Professor Adelsberg was staked in Castel Sant\u0027Angelo. That lieutenant of Dracula\u0027s they used to call Radu the Repulsive was beheaded on the steps of the Museo Borghese. And the Duchess Marguerite De Grand, who was reckoned such a beauty, was destroyed in the shadow of the statues of Castor and Pollux in the Piazza di Quirinale.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve heard of Adelsberg,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027Wasn\u0027t he a war criminal? One of Hitler\u0027s vampire doctors?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s possible he wasn\u0027t a Crimson Executioner victim. The others were real elders, four and five hundred years old, mostly of the Dracula line and with titles and decorations to prove it. The Professor barely had his century. The Israelis may have sent their fellows after him. Or he might have been killed on general principle, by someone with good cause. As you know, that happens when these murderers get a run. Other crimes are laid at their doorsteps. It becomes easy to slip in an unrelated killing. Like hiding a pebble on a beach.\u0027 \u0027As elders go, Count Kernassy didn\u0027t seem such a monster.\u0027 Genevieve wasn\u0027t sure about that. Kate had only known the Count for a few hours at the end of four centuries of life. Kernassy was one of il principe\u0027s Carpathians, and they tended to be a brutal lot. It might be that this one\u0027s manners were a bit above the average. \u0027Still, it\u0027s a rum go,\u0027 said Charles. \u0027You wandering into all this.\u0027 \u0027She met someone at the airport and was dragged off on an adventure,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027Penelope.\u0027 A cloud of fatigue passed over Charles\u0027s face. \u0027Poor Penny,\u0027 he said, quietly. He blamed himself too much for what had happened to Penelope Churchward, for what she had made of herself. \u0027She does turn up rather like the proverbial bad one,\u0027 said Kate. \u0027Penny, I mean. What\u0027s she after doing with Dracula?\u0027 Charles tried to shrug but couldn\u0027t lift his shoulders. It was still a moot point whether Genevieve had stolen Charles away from Penelope, or whether Penny had abandoned him for her father-in-darkness, the ill-remembered Lord Godalming. Genevieve thought neither was entirely true. Charles had left Penelope to her own devices because he felt a greater duty, and Genevieve happened to coincide with that duty. If it had been otherwise, she knew he\u0027d have kept his promise to Penelope, no matter how unhappy it would have made them both. He was, in many ways, an impossible man. \u0027Do you see her?\u0027 Kate asked them both. \u0027She has called,\u0027 Genevieve admitted. \u0027Infrequently.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not surprised.\u0027 \u0027It was a long time ago,\u0027 Charles said, remembering. Not for Genevieve, it wasn\u0027t. And not, she suspected, for Penelope, or for Kate. At the end of his life, Charles was forgiving. Kate and Charles had known Penelope well as a warm girl, of course. Genevieve knew her first as one of those new-borns who didn\u0027t understand anything. Just after turning, Penelope had drunk bad blood and made an invalid of herself for a decade. A quack who treated her with leeches hadn\u0027t helped matters much. If anything, Genevieve - working then as a doctor - had saved Penelope\u0027s life. That had been her duty, so she supposed she wasn\u0027t that different from Charles. \u0027She was the first to tell me I should turn,\u0027 Charles said. \u0027She wanted us to become vampires together. It seemed the done thing, if one wanted to be advanced.\u0027 Kate shot Genevieve an alarmed glance. He was forestalling their carefully composed argument. \u0027Gene, Kate,\u0027 Charles said, looking at them as if they were his ashamed grandchildren, \u0027I know you don\u0027t mean it as she did, but you ask the same thing. The thing I cannot do.\u0027 Kate covered her face, to hide the tears. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Kate,\u0027 Charles said, touching Kate\u0027s elbow. \u0027It\u0027s nothing wrong with you. Or you either, Gene. It\u0027s me.\u0027 Despite the strength of his feelings, he was fading before their eyes. Every day, perhaps every hour, he became fainter, a vaguer presence, losing substance. \u0027You\u0027re not too old, Charles,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027You can turn. I\u0027m sure of it.\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027You could be young again,\u0027 Kate sighed. \u0027He grew young,\u0027 Charles said. \u0027Count Dracula. I doubt if he\u0027d much pleasure of renewed youth. He has always struck me as a profoundly sad individual. When he turned, he lost something. Most vampires do. Even you, my undying darlings.\u0027 He looked serene, but Genevieve heard his excitement. His heart beat faster. His brow was dampened. His voice was near cracking. \u0027Am I so selfish?\u0027 he asked. \u0027To want to leave?\u0027 Later, after nightfall, they sat together, and talked about the past, forcing themselves not to talk of the present and future. Kate prompted Charles to tell Genevieve of many things she had missed during her time away from him this century. She had realised, of course, how close Charles and Kate had grown in the First World War. Now she saw how they had fixed so much of their hope in Edwin Winthrop of the Diogenes Club, whom she\u0027d spent an interesting weekend with in 1923. She almost regretted not being there in the bloody mud of France, in the thick of intrigue at once absurd and terrifying. She was a creature of a slower age, where time was measured by seasons, not wristwatch ticks. She had never adjusted to this century of jet planes and Sputniks, of CinemaScope and rock \u0027n\u0027 roll. Charles had lived through more than she ever would and been affected more by it. She recognised her own untouchability as weakness. Kate would have to do instead. She talked about the Second World War, which she\u0027d seen from the ground as Charles had from maps and despatches. Her commitments were so selfless, to make the world a more just place. Her passion burned with a fierceness Genevieve regretted she could never match. If there was a God, Kate must be closer to Him. Charles grew tired but insisted on staying with \u0027the girls\u0027, nodding at their conversation, dozing even. \u0027It looks like Lord Ruthven won\u0027t be Prime Minister after the next election,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027He\u0027s never really recovered from Suez. But we\u0027ve thought him gone before. When Winston took over in the war, I swore that was the last of him. But he came back. That\u0027s one thing I could do without, politicians whose careers go on forever. Then again, Ruthven is such a chameleon. He keeps fading into the scenery and popping out again as a different person.\u0027 Genevieve asked Kate about new films, plays, books, music. How had London changed? Who had she seen recently? Who was famous? \u0027The Daily Mirror ran a poll about vampires recently, asking who was the most admired, the most disliked. It was to do with an exhibition at Madame Tussauds. Who do you imagine is the most admired vampire in Great Britain today?\u0027 Genevieve couldn\u0027t think. \u0027Edmund Hillary?\u0027 \u0027Good try. No, Cliff Richard.\u0027 \u0027Who?\u0027 \u0027A pop singer. \"Living Doll\"?\u0027 Genevieve had heard the song. \u0027Think of it, Genevieve. He\u0027s never going to get old, never going to lose his voice. Would there ever have been a Caruso if Farinelli had still been around? Could Wagner have competed with a hundred-year-old Mozart? In forty years\u0027 time, when singers who haven\u0027t yet been born should be coming into their own, Cliff Richard will still be there, mooning over his crying, talking, sleeping, walking living doll.\u0027 \u0027They say few vampires achieve distinction in the arts,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027There\u0027ve been exceptions. Trust me, Mr Richard is not one of them.\u0027 Kate tried to hum the song she\u0027d been talking about. Genevieve laughed. \u0027History is dwindling into a hit parade,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027And we have all been doing the Dracula Cha Cha Cha for too long.\u0027 A bell sounded. Swiftly, Genevieve answered the door. It was a liveried footman, with a message. Genevieve took it and bade him goodbye, slitting the envelope open with an extruded thumb-claw. Three gilt-edged cards shuffled out. She returned to the main room, where Charles was alert and Kate intrigued. \u0027We\u0027ve been invited to a party,\u0027 Genevieve announced. \u0027By Prince Dracula and his intended, Princess Asa Vajda. Now fancy that.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-7.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) Rome. 1959.
