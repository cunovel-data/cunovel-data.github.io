{"id":93126,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"THREE CORPSES IN THE FOUNTAIN\\n\\n NOTICE OF ENGAGEMENT, FROM THE TIMES OF LONDON.\\n\\n JULY 15TH, 1959\\n\\n Asa Vajda, Princess of Moldavia, is to be married to Vlad, Count Dracula, formerly Prince of Wallachia, Voivode of Transylvania and Prince Consort of Great Britain. The groom has been married previously to Elisabeta of Transylvania (1448 - 62), Princess Ilona Szilagy of Hungary (1466 - 76), Marguerite Chopin of Courtempierre (1709 - 11), Queen Victoria of Great Britain (1886 - 8) and Sari Gab--r of Hungary and California (1948 - 9). The bride, a distant connection of the groom\u0027s mother, Princess Cneajna Musatina of Moldavia, is of the bloodline of Javutich. Since enforced exile from her homeland in 1938, she has resided in Monaco and Finland. The marriage will take place at the Palazzo Otranto, in Fregene, Italy, on the 31st of October this year.\\n\\n 1\\n\\n Dracula Cha Cha Cha\\n\\n Alitalia offered a special class for vampires, at the front of the aeroplane. The windows were shrouded against the sun with black curtains. It added to the cost. The warm could pay a supplement and share the space - none did on this flight - but Kate couldn\u0027t be seated in the main cabin at the lower fare. The airline assumed the undead were all too wealthy to care, which was not in her case true.\\n\\n The flight departed an overcast Heathrow Airport in mid-afternoon and was scheduled to arrive in Rome at sunset. In the air, she read well into Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. She didn\u0027t take personally the motto, \u0027don\u0027t let the bloodsuckers grind you down,\u0027 and identified more with Arthur Seaton than with the vampires who ran the bicycle factory where he worked. Alan Sillitoe was using a metaphor, not stirring up hatred against her kind. That said, England had pockets of real intolerance: she\u0027d been caught in the Notting Hill blood riots last year, and was fed up with the crucifix-waving teddy boys who hounded her in the launderette.\\n\\n She\u0027d visited Venice in the 1920s and served in Sicily and the South during the Allied invasions, but never before been to Rome. Genevieve had offered to meet her at Fiumicino Airport, but Kate preferred to make her own way into the city. Genevieve was best off staying close to Charles. These were their last days. They deserved time together alone before Kate arrived to shoulder part of the burden and, incidentally and unavoidably, play gooseberry.\\n\\n What was between Charles and Genevieve had always shut her out, even in 1888 when she was a warm girl and Genevieve was his first vampire. Kate loved him, of course, which made her silly and sad and would soon make her lost and alone. She was always last in line with Charles Beauregard: after Pamela, his wife; Penelope, his fiancee; Victoria, his queen; and, hardest to take because she\u0027d be around forever, the sainted Genevieve Dieudonne.\\n\\n Kate had to remind herself often that she liked Genevieve. It probably made things worse.\\n\\n Toward the end of the flight, a snack was offered - a live white mouse. Not liking to feed in public, she declined. Looking up at the smartly uniformed hostess, she noticed a sky-blue scarf wound between her collar and her throat. Kate sensed the warm girl\u0027s bites and wondered if she were required to offer her neck to Alitalia\u0027s important vampire customers. More likely she had an undead boyfriend without much in the way of self-control.\\n\\n \u0027May I have yours as well?\u0027 asked another passenger, a thin-faced elder. \u0027I am peckish.\u0027\\n\\n He already had one wriggling mouse in his left hand.\\n\\n Kate shrugged, politely. He reached over the aisle into the hostess\u0027s little cage.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you, Signora,\u0027 he said, claiming his prize.\\n\\n The vampire opened his mouth like a python. Red membranes unfurled as his jaws unlocked, revealing double rows of fang-needles. He popped both treats into his maw and crunched out the tiny lives. He chewed the mice like gum, working the furry pulp into his cheek, sucking down juices in minute dribbles.\\n\\n The elder wore full soup and fish: ruffled white shirt, black dickie bow, velvet morning coat, brocade waistcoat, Playboy Club signet ring, buckled boots, Patek Lioncourt wristwatch, black opera cape lined with red silk. He looked like a middle-European hawk: black patent-leather hair brushed back from a widow\u0027s peak; white face, red eyes, scarlet lips.\\n\\n \u0027Or is it Signorina?\u0027 he asked around his mouthful.\\n\\n \u0027Miss,\u0027 she admitted. \u0027Katharine Reed.\u0027\\n\\n The elder discreetly spat fur and bones into a paper napkin, which he folded into a small parcel and gave to the hostess for disposal.\\n\\n Nodding a formal greeting, he introduced himself.\\n\\n \u0027Count Gabor Kernassy, of the bloodline of Vlad Dracula, late of il principe\u0027s Carpathian Guard.\u0027\\n\\n In his Italian exile, they called Dracula \u0027il principe\u0027, the Prince. He was born to the title, which distinguished him from the numberless counts - like this one - who floated around in his wake. Sly reference to Machiavelli\u0027s handbook for genial tyrants was also intended.\\n\\n \u0027This is my \"niece\",\u0027 Count Kernassy gestured at the vampire woman in the window seat next to him, \u0027Malenka.\u0027\\n\\n A glance suggested what species of niece Malenka was to the Count. She was dressed for an entrance, in a floor-length scarlet evening gown, cut to display an enormous outcrop of bosom. The neckline was more like a nipple-line, with a deep valley that almost reached her navel. Diamonds sparkled on the upper slopes of her breasts. Her growth of bright blonde hair was equally enormous, and her razor smile was a credit to either bloodline or Swedish dentistry. Her maroon eyes sparkled and dazzled with boredom, contempt and amusement.\\n\\n Kate chided herself for unfairly detesting Malenka on sight. She had her down as a nouveau, one of those new-born vampiresses who attach themselves to convenient elders and try to pass among gentlefolk three hundred years their senior.\\n\\n She waved tiny fingers at the woman. Malenka arched plucked eyebrows.\\n\\n They were the only three vampires on the flight. Kate had an idea she might like the old rogue of a Count, who was on some level aware of the impression Malenka made. Kernassy paused sufficiently in a recitation of his part in several centuries\u0027 of court intrigue to ask her what she did and why she was going to Rome. She avoided the latter question by answering the former.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m a journalist. For The Manchester Guardian and the New Statesman.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Journalisti,\u0027 Malenka spat, the first word Kate had heard from her. \u0027Ani-malss!\u0027\\n\\n Malenka smiled as if she were fond of animals, and enjoyed killing and eating them.\\n\\n \u0027My niece has been pursued by your press. She is highly visible.\u0027\\n\\n Kate didn\u0027t pay much attention to the society pages but had an idea she\u0027d seen photographs in the Tatler of Malenka looking gorgeously bored at a coffee bar in Soho, or supporting a mushroom-cloud hat at Ascot. It was part of her job to keep up with all manner of publications. Also, she liked to know what people were wearing these days.\\n\\n \u0027Motion pictures are interested in her,\u0027 continued the Count. \u0027She photographs.\u0027\\n\\n Many vampires didn\u0027t. Only a few, like Garbo, were film actors or models. Monsieur Erik, angel-voiced spectre of the Paris Opera, not only would not photograph but could not be recorded for gramophone records.\\n\\n \u0027So I imagine,\u0027 Kate snipped.\\n\\n \u0027Your accent? It is not English,\u0027 observed Kernassy. \u0027You are perhaps Canadian?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am perhaps Irish.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They loave me in Ire-land,\u0027 Malenka declared.\\n\\n \u0027Malenka has performed a season at the Gate Theatre in Dublin. She was a very great success.\u0027\\n\\n Kate stopped herself from laughing at the image of Malenka as Molly Bloom.\\n\\n \u0027Many Ire-land men loave me,\u0027 Malenka announced.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure,\u0027 Kate agreed. \u0027I can see that.\u0027\\n\\n Kernassy shared a secret smile. He liked being seen as a rakish\\n\\n \u0027uncle\u0027 to this spectacular but brainless creature. Kate wondered if he\u0027d found her warm and turned her, or inherited her from another exhausted father-in-darkness.\\n\\n \u0027I do believe you will be much loaved in Rome,\u0027 Kate ventured.\\n\\n \u0027You hear that, Malenka?\u0027 said the Count. \u0027Our Miss Reed predicts formidable success for you.\u0027\\n\\n Malenka thrust out her breasts in a kind of seated bow, nodding sharply at unheard applause.\\n\\n \u0027She is to be in a motion picture, in a leading role.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am... Medusa,\u0027 she said, touching long fingernails to her snakeless tresses.\\n\\n Kate could just about see the casting.\\n\\n \u0027No, mia cara,\u0027 Kernassy chided. \u0027You are Medea.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There is difference?\u0027 Malenka looked to Kate for support.\\n\\n \u0027One had adders in her hairdo and froze men to stone with a glance,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027The other helped Jason steal the Golden Fleece but got chucked and bashed their children to death.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think they change ending in script,\u0027 Kernassy said. \u0027The original is - how was it put to me? - \"not box office\". And who would, as you say, \"chuck\" Malenka?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who care for box orifice?\u0027 Malenka smiled. \u0027They will just care for me.\u0027\\n\\n Count Kernassy shrugged. The pilot announced they were near their destination and asked that all seat-belts be refastened, per favore. Malenka had to be helped with the buckle. The belt lay loose in her lap. Trapped in the corseted gown, her waist was tiny.\\n\\n \u0027You are in Rome for the wedding?\u0027 the Count asked.\\n\\n Kate was startled. She didn\u0027t imagine anyone would think that, though the royal engagement had been thoroughly covered, even by the papers she worked for.\\n\\n \u0027I might write something,\u0027 she said, noncommittally.\\n\\n Until now, she\u0027d blocked the wedding from her mind. While she and Genevieve tended Charles\u0027s deathbed, the creature they thought of as blighting their lives for the last seventy years would, amid unparalleled pomp, be taking another wife. There were political and emotional ramifications. In the end, if she could control her hatred, she might indeed write something about it.\\n\\n \u0027We shall be at wedding,\u0027 Malenka said. \u0027Personal guests of il principe.\u0027\\n\\n Kernassy\u0027s eyebrows made Satanic V signs. Like many cloaked Carpathians, he seemed a cut-down imitation of his principe. Did Malenka intend to abandon him for a more distinguished uncle? If so, she\u0027d have to best the Royal Fiancee. Kate gathered that Asa Vajda of Moldavia - la principesa? - was not the sort to be seen off by a gold-digger.\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps you have other affairs?\u0027 the Count remarked, with an elder\u0027s insight. \u0027Mamma Roma has many eternal attractions, some dolorous, some joyful.\u0027\\n\\n Dolorous? Curious word.\\n\\n The plane touched down smoothly and taxied to the terminal.\\n\\n Kernassy courteously let Malenka and Kate leave the plane before him. Naturally, Malenka went first and posed at the top of the movable steps.\\n\\n There were explosions and flares. Kate thought she was being greeted by a fusillade. It would not have been the first time. Cold bright light battered her. Dazzled, she covered her eyes. Flashes danced in her skull.\\n\\n A small orchestra struck up a tune. Incongruously for a welcome, it was \u0027Arrivederci Roma\u0027.\\n\\n Shouts came out of the darkness beyond the popping lights. \u0027La bella Malenka... Signorina... swinging, baby... bene, bene... va-va-voom!\u0027\\n\\n Kernassy helped Kate back into the cabin. She took off her glasses and rubbed her burning eyes. Kodak were marketing a new film for photographing vampires. The flashbulbs that went with it produced nuclear sunbursts.\\n\\n \u0027Everywhere Malenka goes, there are paparazzi,\u0027 explained the Count.\\n\\n Questions were shouted in several languages: \u0027Are you searching for love in Roma?\u0027 - \u0027What do you sleep in?\u0027 - \u0027Has your figure been surgically enhanced?\u0027 - \u0027What of the wedding?\u0027 - \u0027Do you favour the blood of Italian men?\u0027\\n\\n Malenka gave no answers, but outdazzled the flashguns with her smiles. She swivelled her torso to make a distinct silhouette, and bent forward to blow kisses, raising an animal roar of approval. Another battery of cameras went off.\\n\\n Kate had attended press calls at London Airport. They weren\u0027t much like this: \u0027Will you attend any cricket matches, Mr Sinatra?\u0027 - \u0027How do you like our English weather, Miss Desmond?\u0027 - \u0027Would you mind awfully posing for a few snaps for our readers, Mrs Roosevelt?\u0027\\n\\n The aisles filled with baggage-laden passengers wanting to get out of the plane. The hostess explained they would have to wait. La bella celebrity took precedence.\\n\\n Malenka descended the steps as if entering an embassy ball, generous hips swaying. Photographers lay on the tarmac to shoot her from below, wriggling on their backs like up-ended beetles. Kate let Malenka get out of the way and off to one side, surrounded by her press, before leaving the plane again.\\n\\n The orchestra finished their welcoming goodbye to Rome and began to pack their instruments.\\n\\n \u0027We are to be met by a woman from the House of Dracula,\u0027 the Count told her. \u0027She is to arrange transport into the city. You will come with us?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s very kind, Count...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I insist. You have hotel?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A pensione, Count. In Trastevere. Piazza Maria, 24.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You will be delivered safely, Miss Reed. I give you the word of a Kernassy.\u0027\\n\\n The elder probably thought nothing of slaughtering peasant babies to slake his red thirst, but wouldn\u0027t leave an unaccompanied woman adrift in a foreign city. It was easier to go along with him than make an argument.\\n\\n Malenka continued her performance. Behind still-popping bulbs, a troupe of photographers and reporters tumbled like acrobats. Kate had learned to look away from the flashes. There were newsreel cameramen and roving wireless reporters. Had she skipped a few too many pages in Picturegoer? Either Malenka was the new Marilyn Monroe or anybody who decorated an orgy scene rated this treatment in Rome.\\n\\n \u0027Tangenti have been paid so passports will be processed swiftly at customs,\u0027 said Count Kernassy, steering Kate past Malenka\u0027s act and toward a thinner crowd. \u0027Stay close, and you will go through under my cloak.\u0027\\n\\n For a moment, she thought he meant it literally.\\n\\n Among the waiting people was a tall, slim vampire woman in a smart violet jacket and skirt, raising a hand in a matching glove. She wore black, horn-rim sunglasses and a Chinese-pattern headscarf, like someone in disguise. A double rope of pearls wound around her slender neck.\\n\\n \u0027This will be our galoppina,\u0027 Kernassy said. \u0027As you say, our fixer.\u0027\\n\\n The woman took off her dark glasses. Her tiny mouth opened in astonishment, showing piranha teeth.\\n\\n \u0027Katie Reed,\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027Good grief!\u0027\\n\\n Kate supposed she knew Penelope was part of il principe\u0027s household and was therefore in Rome. But, trying to give Penny as little thought as possible, she\u0027d never considered she might be the first person she ran into in the city.\\n\\n \u0027Penny,\u0027 she said, lamely. \u0027Hello.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are old friends, I see,\u0027 Kernassy deduced, not entirely accurately\\n\\n \u0027Count Kernassy, this is Penelope Churchward. We knew each other, a long time ago.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A long time ago means nought to such as we,\u0027 he said, gallantly taking Penelope\u0027s hand.\\n\\n The Englishwoman put on a smile that was significantly more convincing than Malenka\u0027s efforts. One had to know her well to distinguish its flaws.\\n\\n \u0027How you do turn up, Katie,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re here to see Charles, of course.\u0027\\n\\n At the time of her death, Penelope had been engaged to Charles. Her turning vampire ended the arrangement. Genevieve had something to do with it too, though not poor four-eyed Katie Reed. She wondered if Penny wasn\u0027t in Rome at least partly because of Charles. He certainly had a knack of keeping vampire ladies about him. Much like il principe.\\n\\n \u0027Have you seen him?\u0027 Kate asked, hating to.\\n\\n \u0027Not recently. He is an invalid. He must turn soon or be lost to us.\u0027\\n\\n Kate was hoping to persuade him of something similar. That Penelope should mention such a treatment wasn\u0027t encouraging. If it was Penny\u0027s idea, he\u0027d probably be dead set against it. Surely he\u0027d see sense as the last clouds gathered and the reaper sharpened his scythe?\\n\\n Malenka swanned over, all teeth and teats. Paparazzi kept up with her. Discarded flashbulbs shattered like glass confetti. Penelope put her sunglasses back on and was introduced.\\n\\n As the Count had promised, an official escorted them past the scrum for passport control. Half of the passengers on the flight were British and formed the beginnings of an orderly queue. Italians wedged themselves at the front, genially tutting at the eccentricity of a race that believed in waiting for turns rather than scrambling for position.\\n\\n Kate was still too surprised by Penelope\u0027s presence to feel guilty about the slight corruption gaining her preference. She knew tangenti - bribes - from the War, when the black market and the open palm were the only way to get anything done. Peace hadn\u0027t changed Italy much.\\n\\n The Count escorted Malenka. A large warm man in chauffeur\u0027s livery - Penelope addressed him as Klove - carried their many bags. Malenka\u0027s matching luggage was by Vuitton, Kate noticed. She and Penny walked together, wondering what to say to each other.\\n\\n It had been decades.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you for the condolence card, Katie. It was a kindly gesture. You were always thoughtful.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was fond of your mother.\u0027\\n\\n Mrs Churchward had died in 1937.\\n\\n \u0027Mama always liked you,\u0027 Penelope admitted. \u0027You were the sensible one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure of that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you have get?\u0027 Penelope asked, smiling sharply.\\n\\n Kate shook her head. She had chosen not to pass on the Dark Kiss, to extend her bloodline. Only someone special, she had vowed. And someone special had never come along.\\n\\n \u0027I made a brood of sons and granddaughters in darkness. It\u0027s a fearful responsibility, my dear. I\u0027m obliged to further the Godalming bloodline. In poor Art\u0027s memory.\u0027\\n\\n Arthur Holmwood, Lord Godalming, was Penelope\u0027s father-in-darkness, the vampire who had turned her. Like Kate and Penny, he was one of the new-borns of the \u002780s. Like many of their peers, he hadn\u0027t outlasted his natural lifespan. Kate should be closer to Penelope. They were almost sole survivors of their world.\\n\\n \u0027I would found my own house,\u0027 Penelope continued, \u0027but I have duties. Whatever you think of him, we owe il principe a great debt, Katie. I know you were one of the firebrands who got him kicked out of England. But, like it or not, he\u0027s our leader.\u0027\\n\\n Neither Kate nor Penny were directly of the Dracula bloodline. They were free from some of the taints that had poisoned most of their generation.\\n\\n \u0027You must call at the Palazzo Otranto,\u0027 said Penelope, making Kate shiver. \u0027Things are hectic just now, what with wedding arrangements and ambassadorial conspirators. He would receive you, I\u0027m sure. Charles is even invited, and that woman. If Dracula can forgive them, he\u0027ll overlook your little revolutionist enthusiasms.\u0027\\n\\n During the struggle to oust Dracula from the throne of Great Britain, Kate had spent seven years as an outlaw. Hiding from Carpathians who wanted to impale her, she\u0027d edited an underground newssheet. Later, in the First World War, she\u0027d been buried under one of il principe\u0027s marvellous toys, the first breed of tank. She wasn\u0027t sure she could be as forgiving of him as the monster could afford to be of her. She also resented Penny\u0027s implied suggestion that political agitation was a passing hobby, something to fill out boring years of an eternity not spent furthering her bloodline.\\n\\n She caught herself. Penelope was working her strings, as ever. Kate was not going to be that goggle-eyed wallflower again, scandalised by her prettier friend but hanging on every barbed word. When they were alive and Kate was often her chaperone, Penny was already a manipulative child. Now she had a great many more years of practice in the art of getting to people.\\n\\n \u0027Here are the cars,\u0027 Penelope announced.\\n\\n They had hustled through the airport and out onto the road. Parked at the verge were a red two-seater Ferrari and a hearse-like black Fiat. The Ferrari was a setting for Malenka.\\n\\n More bulbs popped as Malenka was assisted into the tiny sports car. She stood tall and blew more kisses at the gathered crowd.\\n\\n Penelope laughed quietly and shook her head, which made Kate think better of her.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m reminded of twin torpedoes, Katie, thrusting.\u0027\\n\\n They had been friends, once.\\n\\n \u0027The rest of us shall ride out of the wind,\u0027 Penelope said. \u0027The bus is a lot roomier than the milk-float.\u0027\\n\\n A warm man loitered by the cars.\\n\\n \u0027Katie, this is Tom,\u0027 introduced Penelope, trailing fingers across his lapel to display ownership. \u0027He is a lost American in Europe.\u0027\\n\\n The young man was attached to the party in a subservient, unofficial fashion. His handshake didn\u0027t give anything away. Kate guessed he was a satellite, and noticed red scratches on his neck. She saw him thinking as he looked her over, and intuited he was totting up the cost of her clothes. His current job was to drive the Ferrari and duck low to stay out of the pictures.\\n\\n Klove held open the rear door of the Fiat and Kate got in, daintily followed by Penelope. They sank together into a deep leather seat. Someone already sat opposite, smoking a cigarette. Count Kernassy gathered his cape and slipped in to join them. The chauffeur silently shut the door and went up front.\\n\\n The Count embraced the smoker, kissing him on both cheeks without disturbing his cigarette.\\n\\n \u0027This is Signorina Reed, a discovery of our flight,\u0027 the Count explained. \u0027She is in your profession, Marcello. A reporter. From Ireland.\u0027\\n\\n The reporter leaned forward into the light. He was strikingly handsome in a bored, tired sort of way. His dark, wavy hair had a trace of unearned grey at the temples. Like Penny, he wore big black sunglasses. He was a living man, so Kate assumed the shades were an affectation.\\n\\n Marcello extended a hand and took hers.\\n\\n Electricity leaped between them.\\n\\n She must watch herself with this Roman reporter. His casual, fag-dripping smile was insinuating. He was trim and smooth, but with an incipient plumpness that might be quite delicious. Under cologne and the tobacco was a scent of sweet blood. His neck was clean of bites.\\n\\n He held her hand a few seconds longer than necessary, then turned to the Count and gabbled with him in Italian, ignoring her a trifle too deliberately.\\n\\n Her heart beat faster. She knew Penelope quietly noticed her new interest. That would come back to haunt her. Penny was always good at storing ammunition for a rainy day.\\n\\n Still, Kate was in Rome. And opposite was a beautiful man.\\n\\n The sun was down by the time they were in the city proper. Kate realised the Count would be staying in the centre of Rome. Her pensione was in Trastevere, through which they were driving. She tried to persuade the elder to let her out, but he waved the request aside.\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely not, mia cara Signorina Reed. We have not done with you yet. I insist you join our party this evening. You and Signorina Churchward have much to talk of. And you must experience Via Veneto by night. It is the most exciting street in the world.\u0027\\n\\n Kate\u0027s rented flat was in the Holloway Road. Not even the most exciting street in North London. She allowed Count Kernassy to overwhelm her.\\n\\n \u0027You will escort Signorina Reed, Marcello,\u0027 Kernassy said, suavely commanding.\\n\\n \u0027But of course,\u0027 Marcello said, his first words of English.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m rather afraid Marcello despises us,\u0027 Penelope said, politely. \u0027He\u0027s gathering material for a novel which will put us all in our places. His subject is the empty night-lives of the eternal rich.\u0027\\n\\n From the set of his mouth, Kate knew Marcello understood what Penelope had said. He had some fluency in English, which was a hopeful sign.\\n\\n \u0027Do you still write for the papers, Katie?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought so.\u0027\\n\\n Penelope sat back. Kate feared she was reddening.\\n\\n \u0027Will you write about Malenka?\u0027 she asked Marcello.\\n\\n Kate wondered why her stomach was tight. And whether she could have come up with a more inane question.\\n\\n Marcello shrugged and expressively tilted his head.\\n\\n \u0027She is like a big doll,\u0027 he said, trying to sneer.\\n\\n Kate knew at once the reporter was smitten with the starlet and felt unaccountably betrayed. The city was doing something to her. It was a hypnotic spell in \u0027Arrivederci, Roma\u0027. She was turning into an idiot.\\n\\n Her throat prickled with red thirst.\\n\\n \u0027But of course he will write of mia cara,\u0027 the Count said, arm snaking around the Italian. \u0027There must be tiny little words to put under the great big photographs. It is a legal requirement.\u0027\\n\\n Kate wondered if Marcello disliked the Count\u0027s patronising purr. There was steel in Kernassy\u0027s velvet, as if he had a hold over the reporter. Perhaps it was as easy to buy an Italian newspaperman as a passport official.\\n\\n The Fiat crossed the Tiber at the Ponte Sisto and followed the Ferrari through the crowded streets of Campo de\u0027 Fiori and Piazza della Rotunda. Traffic horns honked a Spike Jones symphony, punctuated by rude shouts and appreciative cries. Couples on motor scooters zipped in between crawling cars, scarf-wearing girls grinned sweetly at stalled motorists. Pedestrians ambled along in the road rather than the pavement, squeezing between vehicles, talking blithely among themselves. There were even herds of sheep, blinking under the streetlights, driven by sharp-eyed children.\\n\\n \u0027Italian cars are for speed,\u0027 said Marcello, \u0027but Italian cities are not for cars. One can only drive through them at the pace of a walk.\u0027\\n\\n In the Largo di Torre Argentina, a football game was in process. Three-dozen youths booted a ball about among strolling crowds. When the Ferrari drove into the square, the match was abandoned and the players clamoured around. Kate wondered which chassis they worshipped most, that of the car or that of la Malenka.\\n\\n There was a great deal of whistling and stamping. Malenka stood up in the car and waved.\\n\\n Everyone wanted red kisses. Malenka bestowed a few on favoured lads, nipping slightly. She licked blood off her lips, and made a gesture which parted the sea of people. They were able to drive on.\\n\\n Hoots followed them.\\n\\n Kate\u0027s teeth were sharp and her mouth watery. Inconvenient need nagged. Being a vampire meant living with something like an addiction. To blood, and all that came with its letting. The warm were addicted to food and drink, of course, and to air? But the vampire\u0027s need was stronger, crueller, more insistent.\\n\\n \u0027For whom do you write?\u0027 she asked Marcello.\\n\\n He rattled off names of publications she vaguely knew. Lo specchio, Oggi, Europeo.\\n\\n \u0027Marcello once sold the exact same story to Paese sera and Osservatore Romano,\u0027 Kernassy said, laughing.\\n\\n \u0027She won\u0027t understand why that\u0027s amusing, Count,\u0027 Penelope said, sweetly. \u0027Katie, Paese sera is the newspaper of the Italian Communist Party, and Osservatore Romano is the Vatican paper.\u0027\\n\\n Marcello shrugged, showing no shame.\\n\\n \u0027They are deadly enemies, you see, the priests and the reds,\u0027 Penelope explained further.\\n\\n Kate wondered if anyone would mind if she killed Penny.\\n\\n The Count had a suite at the Hotel Hassler, a baroque remainder of old world magnificence at the top of the Spanish Steps. The elder tipped the doorman to the amount Kate expected to pay for a month\u0027s lodging in her pensione.\\n\\n Kate, Penelope, Tom and Marcello sat in the crowded bar while Kernassy and Malenka settled in upstairs. Klove ferried many trunks from the Fiat up to the suite. Kate was self-conscious about her own tiny suitcase. Penny made an observation about her travelling light, implying - correctly - a poverty of wardrobe.\\n\\n Marcello and Tom drank espresso, and Penelope insisted Kate sample the vampire fare. She summoned over a handsome, blank-faced young waiter. He wore a finely striped waistcoat and very tight black trousers. Penny ordered a measure for herself - to be sociable, she said - and one for Kate.\\n\\n The waiter deftly popped a snap-fastener on his cuff and rolled up his sleeve. A tourniquet was tied around his elbow, and a steel needle was stuck into a fat vein in his lower arm, attached by a short clear plastic tube to a spigot.\\n\\n He twisted open the tap and allowed a brief squirt of his blood into a thin cocktail glass. Penelope made great show of sniffing and tasting, then signalled him to go on. The waiter twice measured two inches of the red stuff over ice and a slice of lemon. Penny gave him a handful of lire and waved him away. He couldn\u0027t serve many vampire customers before having to be relieved. Kate wondered how many nights a week he worked. Did poverty-stricken Southerners dribble away their lives to send money home to their families? Or was everyone carefully vetted by a snobbish management?\\n\\n Penelope raised her drink and smiled, delicate fang-points extended.\\n\\n \u0027Good health,\u0027 she said, clinking Kate\u0027s glass and sipping.\\n\\n Kate looked at Marcello, wondering if he were disgusted by this display. She couldn\u0027t tell. He held up his tiny coffee cup in a parody toast.\\n\\n All three of her companions looked at her as she touched her tongue to the cocktail.\\n\\n It was a rush. She had not had human blood for weeks. She forced herself not to gulp. It was rich and would make her giddy if she tossed it down. She savoured a peppery mouthful, let it wash against the back of her throat, then swallowed demurely\\n\\n \u0027Signorina Reed, is it true what they say of Italian men?\u0027 asked Marcello. \u0027Is our blood hot?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This isn\u0027t,\u0027 she said. \u0027It has ice in it.\u0027\\n\\n Marcello smiled with genuine sweetness.\\n\\n \u0027It would have to,\u0027 Tom said. \u0027Or you\u0027d flame away.\u0027\\n\\n Kate sensed a fastidiousness in Penelope\u0027s American friend. If he disliked public displays of vampirism, why was he hanging around Penny? Was he jealous that she was drinking the decanted blood of an anonymous waiter, rather than taking his straight from the barrel?\\n\\n It would take a while to sort all these people out in her mind. If, after tonight, she saw them at all. She could cheerfully avoid Penny for the rest of her visit and knew Tom would prefer her out of the way, but Count Kernassy appeared uncommonly decent for one of the old ones. And Marcello...\\n\\n Malenka swept into the bar in a new dress and caused a sensation.\\n\\n Kate assumed the Via Veneto was less likely to be bowled over by Malenka. The most beautiful, famous, notorious, and interesting people in the world gathered here nightly. She was sure she spotted Jean-Paul Sartre outside the Cafe de Paris, shrinking under the awning as Simone de Beauvoir arm-wrestled Ernest Hemingway into submission. Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer strolled past arm in arm, a pack of worshipful urchins at their heels.\\n\\n But Malenka conquered all.\\n\\n Her gown, from the House of Massimo Morlacchi, was a masterpiece of architectural engineering. Midnight black velvet, it was cut low, slashed high and had round windows at the waist. Malenka was one of those vampires who didn\u0027t breathe. Any expansion of her rib-cage would explode the whole assembly. A white Wendigo fur wrap writhed on her wide, white shoulders - she had huge, lady-wrestler shoulders, Penny eagerly pointed out - as if it still had some remnant of life.\\n\\n The Count displayed his niece. She rested a hand on his arm, her white flesh glowing, shoving the elder into permanent shadow.\\n\\n Kate and Penelope, vaguely escorted by Marcello and Tom, followed paces behind the main attraction. The faithful Klove was somewhere near in case anyone was too overenthusiastic in their attentions.\\n\\n The paparazzi ran in a pack, snapping at Malenka, insatiable and insistent. Kate was sure she would show up as a smudge in the corner of a lot of pictures. She didn\u0027t photograph well.\\n\\n They went from the Rosati to the Strega to the Zeppa to the Doney, stopping for drinks at each. Marcello stayed with espresso but Tom was on to amaretti. Penelope sweetly goaded Kate into more vampire cocktails.\\n\\n She became quite drunk. There might be something in these stories of the virile blood of Italian men. She allowed Marcello to support her, but went rigid whenever she thought she was turning clingy or clumsy.\\n\\n She stopped drinking. No one noticed. She could gut a nun with a breadknife tonight and no one would notice. She was carried along in Malenka\u0027s tide.\\n\\n At each stop, youths offered their necks to Malenka. Some she petted, some she bit, some she almost drained. She must be glutted, and yet she was still white as bone and ice. Kate gathered that one warm lad turned cold in her arms and nearly died, happy, refusing to complain.\\n\\n At each cafe, and in the streets, there was music. More orchestras, portable gramophones, tiny wirelesses. Humming, singing, stamping, cheering people. One irritating song was everywhere. When Kate realised what it was called, she had the presence of mind to be aghast.\\n\\n Malenka sailed on in rhythm. Every few seconds she paused, and gave three sudden thrusts with her hips and elbows.\\n\\n Cha cha cha...\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s for the wedding,\u0027 Penelope told Kate. \u0027Embarrassing, really. Princess Asa hates it.\u0027\\n\\n Drac-u-la, Drac-u-la...\\n\\n Dra... Cha cha cha...\\n\\n Malenka danced as she walked. Supposedly phlegmatic sophisticates stopped to stare. Famous people allowed themselves for the moment to take supporting roles in the great Technicolor pageant of her procession. The television playwright Clare Quilty made an ostentatious point of ignoring the passing sensation, and said something waspish about overdevelopment to his wraithlike vampire companion, Vivian Darkbloom. The actor Edmond Purdom registered more emotion and interest on his face than he managed in any of his films. The Polish werewolf Waldemar Daninski howled and barked, like the big bad wolf in the Tex Avery cartoons.\\n\\n Appalled and astonished, Kate looked at Marcello. Without taking his eyes off of Malenka\u0027s rotating derriere, he shrugged and lit another cigarette. She waved her fingers to catch his attention. He offered her his cigarette case and she took one, to smoke the taste of blood out of her mouth. He flipped open a Zippo lighter and she bent to suck flame. They bumped heads and apologised.\\n\\n There was something here.\\n\\n She looked around and saw Penelope and Tom lagging back. Penny talked intently at the American, gripping his arm. That must be another story.\\n\\n Stray paparazzi, blocked from getting through to Malenka and the Count, pestered Marcello and Kate. He told them to go away and that he was a nobody like them, but they snapped and popped anyway. Kate knew enough to shield her eyes.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll have to get some dark glasses,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Marcello laughed. \u0027Everybody wears them, I admit. We are all in hiding. It is a Roman tradition.\u0027\\n\\n Penelope and Tom were gone. The Count was taken up with Malenka. His promise to see Kate to Trastevere was gone with the setting sun. So much for the word of Kernassy.\\n\\n She thought Marcello might look after her, though his attention, like everybody else\u0027s, was fixed on Malenka. No, his attention was different. She recognised an ironic distance. He wasn\u0027t involved. He took it all in, to write about later.\\n\\n She was a bit like that too.\\n\\n But Malenka had bewitched him, as she had all other men. It must be those ridiculous breasts. And all that hair.\\n\\n A satyr-bearded man in a polo-neckjerseyjumped out of a palm tree and threw himself down on the road, begging Malenka to \u0027cha cha cha\u0027 over him. Klove picked him up and shoved him back into the crowd.\\n\\n Cha cha cha...\\n\\n Suddenly, it all seemed desperately funny. Kate began laughing, and Marcello politely joined in.\\n\\n \u0027Drac-u-la... Dra... cha cha cha,\u0027 she gasped, making fumbling arm movements. \u0027Cha cha cha!\u0027\\n\\n It was all too silly.\\n\\n Marcello stopped her falling down.\\n\\n Time passed in a rapid blur. More cafes, more famous faces, more crowds. A constellation of flashbulb supernovae. Malenka wanted to visit this bar, to be snapped with that picturesque orphan, to sample a specific waiter\u0027s blood in a certain out-of-the-way trattoria, to be seen in front of every famous frontage in Rome, to hug a surprised country priest and show him her teeth.\\n\\n Kate wondered how many of the crowd were staying the distance in the hope that Malenka\u0027s miracle dress would collapse completely. Already, her cha cha cha had torn new splits over her hips, causing great excitement. Kate half thought it the fashion equivalent of an ice sculpture, crafted to last for only so long. Before dawn, it would fall away in pieces and the photographers would finally get the shots they needed to complete their portfolios.\\n\\n Marcello got Kate through it. Without him, she\u0027d have been left behind in some cafe, like her suitcase (which was at the Hassler, she remembered). She considered a dozen different ways to ask if he would care to have her nip his neck, trying to frame it in a way that would suggest she was offering herself politely but not insistently to him rather than planning something close to rape.\\n\\n He was a bit irritated with her. Every time it looked as if he might get closer to Malenka, she was in the way. Sensing how he felt, she tried to be sober and didn\u0027t do a good job of it. Her expression must be comically solemn, for despite himself Marcello was forced to laugh at her.\\n\\n The cocktails hadn\u0027t helped. The red thirst was gone, but the need was there. Blood was not enough. It was very civilised and midcentury to decant it into glass and take it like a tonic, but she needed human contact, her mouth on sensitive skin, her fangs piercing, the sighs in her ears, the unresisting body in her arms, the rush of feelings.\\n\\n She was being silly, quite as stupidly blatant as Malenka. Penelope didn\u0027t have to go through all this face-pulling to attract attention. Or Genevieve, who was French and only had to ignore a person for a few minutes to make him her slave forever.\\n\\n Kate noticed suddenly how hot it was. Midnight had come and gone, but the night was still balmy and tropical. Her face burned, as if she were warm. Blood-tides pounded in her temples, and she was unsteady on her feet.\\n\\n How did it happen? The crowds melted away. Their footsteps echoed in empty streets. Malenka still hummed the \u0027Dracula Cha Cha Cha\u0027.\\n\\n Kate focused on something famous.\\n\\n The Trevi Fountain. A statuary group depicted King Poseidon and his Tritons, pouring forth water from seashell spouts. One Triton struggled with a rearing sea-horse, the other led a docile creature. The sea-horses symbolised the unpredictable moods of the sea, her Baedeker said. She\u0027d planned to visit the Piazza di Trevi on her \u0027Roman holiday\u0027, thinking even of tossing away fifty lire and making a wish.\\n\\n A cat meowed. It padded elegantly along the rim of the fountain pool and nuzzled up to Malenka\u0027s plump, pale arm. She picked the cat up and rubbed its face against hers. Its white fur exactly matched her wrap.\\n\\n \u0027Poor little lost dear,\u0027 she said. \u0027He must have milk.\u0027\\n\\n It was a command. She looked at Count Kernassy, and he looked at Marcello.\\n\\n \u0027Everywhere is shut,\u0027 he said. \u0027Even in Roma...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There will be somewhere,\u0027 Malenka declared. \u0027It would not do to let such a tiny beauty die of thirst.\u0027\\n\\n She made kissing sounds. The cat climbed onto her head. It curled up, like a slit-eyed busby.\\n\\n \u0027Marcello, see to it,\u0027 the Count said, coldly. He handed over banknotes, which Marcello made disappear.\\n\\n Kate was embarrassed. Marcello politely withdrew, in search of milk, fuming behind his sunglasses. She understood he was as much a pet as this suddenly adopted cat, and felt bad for him, bad about herself.\\n\\n She was more like him than she was like these people.\\n\\n Malenka leaped up onto the fountain. The cat slid off her head and landed unsurprisingly in her cleavage, slipping comfortably into the flesh valley. Malenka tightrope-tiptoed along the edge, then stepped into the water. It rose to her thighs. Her dress spread like a water lily.\\n\\n The cat was spooked. It yowled and scratched. Malenka bit into its neck and threw it away. She wiped blood from her mouth with the back of her hand.\\n\\n They wouldn\u0027t need milk any more.\\n\\n Kate sat down on a stone bench. Her head span.\\n\\n Whatever the cat had sensed made her tingle. She felt her claws starting.\\n\\n Malenka\u0027s mood changed again. She waded among the waters, beseeching the Count to join her, letting the cascade fall on her hair, her face, her chest.\\n\\n \u0027There are coins. You can dive for treasure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are mio tesoro, cara.\u0027\\n\\n Malenka draped herself over a sea-horse, pointing her breasts at the stars.\\n\\n One of the cocktail waiters must have been suffering from a fever. Kate was not feeling at all well. Impressions filtered into her mind in flashbulb bursts. Hot, dusty, empty landscape. Laughing famous faces. A dangerous crimson shadow.\\n\\n She lay on the bench, head throbbing.\\n\\n Something fast and red bounded into the piazza. Kernassy turned, cloak swirling, and was struck. The elder was lifted up and tossed into the fountain. His head was gone completely. Blood fountained from his neck-stump. His torso tumbled backwards, tangled in the cloak. The head soared and crashed into a pool, face powdering off it.\\n\\n Kate tried to sit up, but couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n Malenka screamed in fury, talons and fangs starting. She leaped like a lioness. Something that flashed silver struck under her bosom.\\n\\n Kate got up and tried to step forward. A hand took her by the back of the neck and made her watch. She had seen true death come to many vampires. Most elders went like Kernassy, turned instantly to dust and bones, centuries of age and decay catching up in seconds.\\n\\n Something she\u0027d never seen before happened to Malenka.\\n\\n If she had grown old as a warm woman, Malenka would have become fat. It was in her body type, a ripeness ready to swell. Now, pockets of blubber bulged under Malenka\u0027s skin, inflating her face, her belly, her thighs, her torso, her arms. She ballooned, splitting like overcooked sausage. White stuff, veined with red, bubbled out of her rent skin. Her dress exploded.\\n\\n Malenka boiled over. Her cheeks expanded, and her forehead, her jowls, her throat, even her lips. Her eyes stared in panic from the bottoms of their wells of flesh, imploring. Kate was stabbed with guilt for having taken a petty dislike to this woman. Blood poured from Malenka, along with masses of fatty tissue. Her hands were huge, meat hanging off their backs and the fingers.\\n\\n Kate was held fast like a kitten. An outsize hand gripped the back of her neck, clamping her shorn hackles. She looked down. The Count\u0027s cloak floated like a wingspread of black duckweed. Coins lay like a scatter of eyes on the pool-bed.\\n\\n She braced comparatively tiny hands against the low stone rim.\\n\\n Operatic laughter roared out of the Piazza di Trevi and up the Quirinal Hill. The killer was bellowing gusts of triumphant hilarity. The fountain\u0027s rush was muted for a moment.\\n\\n She was pushed slowly forward. Her elbows began to bend the wrong way. Her thick specs, blobbed with droplets, slid down her nose, blurring everything further. Fang-teeth sharpened in her mouth, an instinctive defence mechanism rather than a response to spilled blood. She felt no flicker of red thirst, only disgust and puzzlement.\\n\\n The killer steadily forced her face to the water, as if he wanted to make this kitten drink. Maybe he thought her of a bloodline susceptible to running water or, considering the nearness of the church of Santa Maria in Trivio, holy water. If so, he was wrong. She wasn\u0027t even Catholic: water thrice-blessed by the Pope would only get her wet.\\n\\n Kernassy\u0027s fleshless skull grinned from one of the upper pools. His empty boots lay among coins. Ribbons of old blood, the foul blood of the Dracula line, threaded through the water, not mixing. It was sucked up from the pool and sprayed from the jets, falling all around like dead rain.\\n\\n Face near the surface of the water, dizzy from the stink of spoiled blood, Kate focused on the killer\u0027s rippling reflection: crimson skull-cowl, black domino mask, tunnel-mouth nostrils, Burt Lancaster grin. Bare-chested, he displayed an expansively muscled and oiled torso.\\n\\n Her hands slipped from the rim and plunged into cold water. She was shoved forward and her chest slammed against stone. Her glasses fell off and splashed into the fountain. Without specs and with the agitation of the water, she glimpsed a dark image between the wavelets - her own reflection, rarely seen. It hadn\u0027t vanished altogether like those of some vampires, or been stolen away like Peter Pan\u0027s shadow. But, since her turning, it was hard to find. Only in extraordinary circumstances, like the imminence of true death, did her reflection come back.\\n\\n For a mad moment, she was distracted. So this was how she looked with short hair. Not bad - very mid-century, a sort of existentialist Joan of Arc. She\u0027d been tempted to hack off her waist-length red rope since the 1920s. Only now, with the European fashion for cropped bobs, had she dared ask her hairdresser to wield the silver scissors.\\n\\n The killer, laughing like a demon of mockery, had a knee on her spine, pinning her to the edge of the fountain. He let go of her neck. She reached behind, and her fingers scrabbled on his muscular leg. He wore thick tights.\\n\\n She was going to be murdered by a Mexican wrestler. It was too silly for words.\\n\\n If he kept pressing, her ribs would shatter. If a broken bone stuck through her heart, she would die. Again. This time, it would take.\\n\\n The killer wasn\u0027t a vampire. His strength of wrist equalled most elders, but his hand was hot, sweaty. She felt a strong pumping of blood in his thigh. He was a warm man, alive.\\n\\n The noises of her body were more distinct than the crash of the water. Blood pulsed in her ears. Bones creaked inside her chest. Her reflected face, clear now even to her fogged eyes, looked up in rabbiteyed panic. She seemed a young woman, the 25-year-old twit she\u0027d been in 1888. She was hurting, not a common thing with her.\\n\\n The pressure on her back let up slightly. The laughter stopped.\\n\\n Kate\u0027s first thought, a universal journalist\u0027s instinct, was not to save herself but to understand. She scooped up her wet specs, sliding them on.\\n\\n She still couldn\u0027t get up. Even if she bent her neck back as far as it would go, she couldn\u0027t see above the broad pool. At the other side of the water was another reflected face.\\n\\n A little girl peered over the rim. In her upside-down face, a frowning crescent mouth floated above a sad eye. She had long hair, blonde like Genevieve\u0027s. Ripples made her shimmer, as if she were shaking her head solemnly. A tear crawled up her hollow cheek.\\n\\n Kate tried to think of the Italian for \u0027run away\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027Va,\u0027 she tried to shout, coming out only with a gasp.\\n\\n The girl didn\u0027t move. She was a ghost in the water, stuck in time.\\n\\n The killer removed his knee from her back. Kate tried to gather her vampire qualities. Talons slipped easily from her fingers. Her teeth became fangs. Strength uncoiled in her limbs.\\n\\n She sprang up and balanced on the rim of the fountain, clawing at empty air, ready to kill... nothing.\\n\\n The killer was gone, spirited away. Kate looked across the piazza for the little girl. She heard the rapid pit-pat of the child running off down the Via delle Muratte and saw the last of her shadow, enormous on a far wall. The roaring hiss of the fountain returned, filling her ears.\\n\\n Her flash of anger passed, her teeth and claws receded. In place of fighting rage, she had only puzzlement. She knew she had missed something. She stood alone in Piazza di Trevi with the truly dead.\\n\\n Then Marcello came back with milk. He gently set the bottle on the brick pavement and came over to her. There was dawnlight in the sky. Hating herself for living the cliche, she swooned in his arms. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-1.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) \\n Rome. 1959.
