Melissa, my grandmother-in-darkness, is one of those forever children, turned as a six-year-old. She\u0027s been \"fwightfully cwoss\" for the best part of a thousand years.\u0027\n She wondered if Melissa d\u0027Acques were here. Genevieve hadn\u0027t heard of the old girl in over a hundred years. Once, that would have meant that the elder had been destroyed. Now, it suggested she was one of that circle who disapproved of Dracula\u0027s showboating. Some were so used to living in shadow that they would never forgive il principe for taking the public stage, shattering forever the exclusivity of vampirism.\n The word went round that Dracula was expected soon.\n Penelope was receiving orders from Princess Asa, who had changed her outfit twice already during the party. Two hundred years hadn\u0027t altered her imperious looks. The odd creation she now wore was as apt for Mongo as Moldavia.\n Asa had a savage, almost Mongol face. Currently, it was framed by a demon ruff of lizard-like material, which served as collar for a turquoise satin train supported by a pair of dwarves made up as turbaned blackamoors. Under the cape, she wore an abbreviated brass Valkyrie breastplate and a short skirt of chain mail and leather. The spike heels of her thigh-length jackboots added as much to her height as her topiary tower of hair. The Princess carried a coil of bullwhip, the like of which she must have used to knout her peasants back in the good old days.\n Bond was taken with the Royal Fiancee. Genevieve thought the Princess looked ridiculous, but in this company it took a lot to stand out. And Asa Vajda certainly stood out.\n Penelope nodded curtly as she accepted each royal decree. There would be trumpets, torches and a cannonade from the battlements. Penny argued that it might be more politic for the cannons to be pointed out to sea rather than over the town.\n \u0027A fall of chain-shot is a poor substitute for confetti, Princess,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Pah!\u0027 declared Asa. \u0027What care we for mortals! They should be grateful to bleed and die in commemoration of my happiness. If we fire out to sea, what will happen? Only fish will die. I like not fish.\u0027\n Penelope looked at the end of her rope. Genevieve had an impulse to help the Englishwoman.\n \u0027It\u0027s traditional for Dracula\u0027s guns to fire at the sea,\u0027 she put in. \u0027To avenge the flood of 1469, which cut off the retreating Turks and prevented Vlad\u0027s armies from hacking the foemen to pieces.\u0027\n Foemen, that was good. Very fifteenth century. Asa swivelled her enormous eyes.\n \u0027The Dieudonne girl,\u0027 she said. \u0027Carmilla Karnstein\u0027s little friend.\u0027\n \u0027So pleased to see you again, Asa.\u0027\n Three hundred years ago, Melissa d\u0027Acques had called a gathering of female elders in the Black Forest. They were supposed to debate some point of nosferatu protocol none could understand, but Genevieve alone realised it was because her grandmother-in-darkness was lonely for new playmates. They\u0027d spent the month dressing up and chasing huntsmen in the woods. Princess Asa hadn\u0027t liked Genevieve then, and wasn\u0027t about to change her opinion now.\n \u0027Chut,\u0027 Asa said, which might be either a Moldavian greeting or a deadly insult.\n \u0027Chut to you too, cherie.\u0027\n \u0027This flood of 1469...?\u0027\n She had made it up, of course.\n \u0027A rebuke to Poseidon. Il principe will be honoured.\u0027\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 decided the Princess. \u0027Englishwoman, you may bombard the waves.\u0027\n Penelope was relieved. Like Caligula, she could now claim victory over the sea.\n A red ball bounced off the dance floor. Asa looked at it as if it were an interloper.\n \u0027And have this ball burst,\u0027 she ordered.\n The point of tyranny was to be arbitrary. Asa had probably read her Machiavelli and was trying to surpass his model. Sometimes, it did to issue meaningless commands to see how swiftly one\u0027s retainers snapped to.\n Kate Reed stumbled out of the crowd, apparently following the ball. She was in a state. Her eyes were enlarged and red. There was blood on her mouth and down the front of her dress. She was so fixated on the ball that she tripped.\n Genevieve caught the woman. Kate struggled a bit, then slowly recognised her.\n \u0027If it isn\u0027t Mademoiselle Perfect,\u0027 she said.\n Genevieve knew better than to be hurt. Kate was well gone into the red madness.\n \u0027Do you know how you make the rest of us feel?\u0027 Kate continued. \u0027You, the lady elder, the vampire saint, the marble adventuress? Sixteen and milky-white on the outside, with all that genius and generosity of spirit caged up inside you?\u0027\n Genevieve looked at Penelope and Asa. Neither commented.\n \u0027I\u0027m like you, Kate,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m not special.\u0027\n Kate laughed bitterly, to the point of tears.\n \u0027It\u0027s no wonder you won him,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027None of us had a chance. You\u0027re like a statue. Beside you, we\u0027re all ratty little kids. We change and shrivel and die, and you go on and on and on, always perfect, always modestly triumphant. The rest of us are the wreckage left behind.\u0027\n \u0027I think you\u0027ve had enough to drink, Katie,\u0027 said Penelope.\n \u0027Yes, I know. I\u0027m sorry, Genevieve. You\u0027re right. I\u0027m not being me.\u0027\n Despite everything, a sliver of ice got through. Kate was drunk, but could still think. Perhaps drink only freed her to say what she\u0027d always thought. Perhaps Genevieve was an impossible presence. In the end, everyone she knew suffered.\n She tried to find the love in her heart, the thing that made her different from Asa Vajda or Prince Dracula, the constant throb she\u0027d felt for Charles, and through him for his warm world. Momentarily, she thought it was there no longer.\n \u0027I\u0027ve hurt you,\u0027 Kate said, reaching out for her cheek, fingertip touching a tear. \u0027I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m wrong. You\u0027re still alive.\u0027\n Kate was crying too. Penelope held her tight.\n Again, the three were joined by tears.\n \u0027No one must weep at my party,\u0027 Asa said. \u0027This I decree. All must smile, all must be happy. On pain of impalement.\u0027\n \u0027I apologise, Princess,\u0027 began Penelope. \u0027My friend meant no...\u0027\n Asa flicked out the tip of her whip and slapped Penelope across the face as if with her open hand.\n The whipcrack was like a gunshot.\n Bond flinched, hand slipping into his jacket. Then he relaxed. This was women\u0027s business. He could enjoy the show.\n Kate was suddenly calm. She set the shocked Penelope, whose face bore a broad red mark specked with blood, down in a chair, and faced up to Asa Vajda, who was at least eighteen inches the taller.\n \u0027You old cow,\u0027 she said, and punched the Princess in the throat.\n Asa staggered under the blow, unsteady on her heels. Her imps tripped under the train and tugged it off her shoulders. A clasp at the neck snapped. The Princess emerged from her satin shroud and lashed again with the whip.\n Kate caught the leather snake with her forearm and wrapped it several times around her wrist, tugging on it like a lasso, further unbalancing Asa. Both women wore heels, but Kate could kick off her Perugia shoes and fight in her stocking feet. She did so, and lost another three inches.\n Princess Asa\u0027s face swelled at the sides, as if teeth were sprouting around her eyes and along the insides of her jaws.\n \u0027It\u0027s not a good idea to bash the bride,\u0027 Bond said. \u0027Why don\u0027t you girls kiss and make up.\u0027\n Kate yanked hard on the whip, pulling Asa toward her, within range of her clawed hand. She got her fingers in the Princess\u0027s hair and dismantled the beehive, flopping black strands over her face. Red wheals were scratched across Asa\u0027s cheek, but healed at once.\n With terrier-like ferocity, Kate lifted Asa off the floor and slammed her several times against a column. The Princess\u0027s head slapped back and forth and she screeched with fury. Kate dropped her and stood back, letting her recover a little.\n Asa kicked out with a booted leg and caught Kate behind the knees, sweeping her off the floor. She fell badly, whip still around her wrist, and the Princess placed a boot-toe on her forehead.\n \u0027Yield,\u0027 she said, an Amazon addressing an ant.\n Of course, everyone in the room gathered around, watching. Flashbulbs popped. Kate lay like a beached fish, the fight gone out of her.\n Genevieve felt more tears on her cheek.\n \u0027That\u0027s enough, Asa,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027She must yield,\u0027 the Princess said. \u0027For that, I will reward her with a swift, merciful death.\u0027\n \u0027You can\u0027t do that any more, Asa. You haven\u0027t been able to do that for years. You don\u0027t own serfs any more. You don\u0027t have a right to take their lives.\u0027\n Asa looked down at Kate, then at Genevieve. She was not a stupid barbarian. That was what frightened Genevieve. Nothing was worse than a clever barbarian.\n \u0027You are right, Genevieve of the line of d\u0027Acques. In this century, we have let things slip. Peasants dare to strike their betters...\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not a peasant,\u0027 gurgled Kate. \u0027I\u0027m a journalist. Haut bourgeois, I admit. Remember the bourgeoisie, Princess. We superseded feudal chieftains in the eighteenth century.\u0027\n Asa slipped her heel into Kate\u0027s mouth, shutting off her talk.\n \u0027This is where everything changes back,\u0027 decreed the Princess. \u0027This is where things become as they ought to be.\u0027\n Genevieve knew she would kill Asa before the Princess could further hurt Kate. And then she would be torn apart herself. Dracula would arrive at his party just in time to dip his fingers in her cooling blood.\n It had been the same at Melissa\u0027s gathering. Put female vampire elders in a room and they take to fighting like cats.\n Princess Asa reached out a hand.\n \u0027You there, fat man with a beard,\u0027 she said, to Orson Welles.\n The genius was surprised to be singled out, but not displeased.\n \u0027I have need of your sword,\u0027 Asa said.\n Welles held what looked like a silver-plated cavalry sabre, already stained red.\n \u0027Let it be known,\u0027 shouted the Princess as she took Welles\u0027s sword, \u0027that, as in Moldavia, I am prepared to act as my own headsman.\u0027\n She took her foot off Kate\u0027s face and raised the sword.\n \u0027So perish all who defy the Princess Asa Dracula!\u0027\n The sword flashed as it came down on Kate\u0027s neck. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-21.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) \n Rome. 1959.
