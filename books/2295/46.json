{"id":93171,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"The seminar moved indoors to Croft\u0027s rooms in the Santonix wing. He had a suite to himself. That must infuriate the lesser lights of the School of Vampirism.\\n\\n The outer office was the domain of Miss Brabazon, a middle-aged secretary. One lens of her Lennon specs was black. She gave Croft a sheaf of messages he handed back dismissively. The twins settled on low, amorphous orange chairs. Bored with blowing bubblegum balloons through fangs, they lit Gitanes. Pony shoved a tiny button in her ear and tuned a transistor radio to whatever the Light Programme changed its name to last year (Kate knew it was BBC Radio 1 but wouldn\u0027t admit it). She nodded mindlessly to The Move, The Flower People or The Small Faces. Cathy flipped through Cue and found pictures of Toby Dammit in open-necked shirts. Kate had written for \u0027Britain\u0027s first teenage newspaper\u0027 until her interview with Jimi Hendrix - mostly about Vietnam and Malcolm X, until the subs got to it - came out headlined \u0027that\u0027s the man who plays guitar with his teeth and says each frizzy strand of his hair is a vindication\u0027.\\n\\n Kate followed Croft into an inner sanctum.\\n\\n Remembering her father\u0027s cluttered study, she was surprised Croft could teach without a single book in sight. No pictures hung on the black walls, though a neon-faced twenty-four-hour clock might count as art. Executive toys were stranded on his concrete slab desk: a Newton\u0027s Cradle and a Drinking Bird. Students sat in chrome-tube-and-leather slings. The Professor had a diabolical mastermind swivel chair with a control panel in one arm. He pressed a button. Tinted window-blinds rolled down, minimising painful sunlight. Conceivably, other buttons opened a trapdoor to a piranha tank or fired laser beams at the School of Humanities.\\n\\n She considered the Black Monks.\\n\\n Eric DeBoys, star pupil and leading light, stuck close to her all the way into the building and up to this room, showing off his teeth and - she could swear - trying to exercise a power of fascination on her. She\u0027d developed immunity to vampire mesmerism before detachable shirt collars went out. Was DeBoys smitten? More likely, he tried it on with any woman who crossed his path. She slapped herself mentally for her instinctive prickle of interest. The last thing she needed in her life (or her knickers) was another vampire knob.\\n\\n If he wanted trouble, he could always apply to the twins. Cathy and Pony would leave Eric DeBoys lying in a pool of blood and laugh about it all the way home.\\n\\n She had gathered names and noted significant traits of the rest of the seminar group.\\n\\n The blokes were a mixed bag. Most were negligible knock-offs of DeBoys. Scrawdyke, a scruffy git with a strident, Northernish voice, projected lethargic aggression. Hair sprouted from every part of his face except his chin. Withnail, a slender glutton, possessed thirsty eyes and an actorish gait. Mo?se King, a brutal toff, had scars around his little boy mouth and, she suspected, exercise books full of poetry he\u0027d never let anyone read. Simon Armstrong was a bespectacled, over-eager swot; the others picked on him because he let his infatuation with Croft show.\\n\\n Two of the men were more interesting. James Eastman, a longarmed, sceptical American, was hollow-eyed and black-stubbled, and spoke in a whispery, dry rasp. In this group, the symptoms were unusual. He was fasting, defying his vampire hunger by abstaining from human blood. A spiritual trip? Self-punishment? Plain masochism? He didn\u0027t wear the black robes, and looked like an outlaw biker in stained denim jacket and scuffed leather britches. Keith Kenneth, a vulpine predator, was Eastman\u0027s mirror: a decadent rather than an ascetic, pallor pinked with recent indulgence. He wore a loose purple silk shirt and matching velvet trews under his robe. A choker of love beads didn\u0027t quite cover a maroon bruise on his throat. How did he get that? If anyone here was Bellaver\u0027s killer, Keith was the most likely prospect. She could see him prowling noisy disco darks for biteable pick-ups. Had he sighted Carol or Laura and just pounced?\\n\\n There were two girls. Anna Franklyn approximated monk\u0027s habit with a shimmering green-black sari and headscarf. A dark, exotic woman with a pixie haircut, she showed a stretch of tight olive-tan midriff. No longer a new-born, Anna might be about Kate\u0027s age, a Victorian holdover. She was of an odd bloodline, Indian rakasha or Malay naga. Her sinuous, serpentine manner betokened a reptile totem, not the bat or rat of a European strigoi or nosferatu. She was notionally Simon\u0027s girlfriend, if only because DeBoys didn\u0027t choose to take her away yet. Fran, a full-bodied vamp, was no one\u0027s but her own. She wore a black velvet dress with a plunging front that showed off ginormous bazooms; the only monklike aspect of her ensemble was a rope-belt resting on generous hips. On a whim, she might pass an afternoon in bed with one or more of the unattached (or attached) lads, but she was a free agent. Fran had newly healed bites which matched Keith\u0027s. Had they torn into each other? In Kate\u0027s day, newborns were advised not to attempt mutual vampirism, which tended to lead lovers to bleeding each other out. This new generation were up for any kink. She wondered if Fran had laid Caleb Croft, then realised that of course she had. Ice grinding on ice. Ugh.\\n\\n Most of the Black Monks followed DeBoys\u0027 lead, as if he were the apostle who passed on the Professor\u0027s dictates. None of them loved or liked him, or each other, much. That was a problem with small, mostly-male, exclusively vampire groups: so much competition for attention or favour, they never got anything done. Who\u0027d split the order and strike out on his own? Who\u0027d stick around and wither away? Eastman was a prime candidate to hit the road, with Sartre, Camus and Roquentin packed in his Harley\u0027s saddlebags and mirrored sunglasses over red eyes. Armstrong would be here until he was a used-up shell. In two hundred years, he\u0027d be parroting Croft\u0027s lectures to new generations of soul-dead students.\\n\\n The Professor sat behind his desk. He set the Newton\u0027s Cradle clacking. The perpetual motion bird dipped to drink. The eye and ear were drawn to the desk and the man behind it. Like Marcus Monserrat\u0027s disco lights. Hah, Croft needed tools! His eyes weren\u0027t enough. His powers of fascination were weak. It was unlikely he\u0027d mindwiped Thomas Nolan. Unless this was a feint. He wouldn\u0027t be the first vampire to adopt a pose of feebleness to gull prey, only showing steel, sinew and fang at the last moment. She was not a good detective: she could talk herself out of any insight, consider a knot from so many angles she never got her fingers into it.\\n\\n \u0027Would you care to sit here, by me?\u0027 Croft asked her.\\n\\n Of course, she would not care to. But she did, in a plain wooden guest chair.\\n\\n \u0027Point of order,\u0027 said Scrawdyke. \u0027Does the group recognise the visiting speaker\u0027s status as a vampire elder?\u0027\\n\\n Kate showed her teeth, satisfying everyone except Scrawdyke.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t shapeshift,\u0027 she said. \u0027And it\u0027s still rude to ask a lady\u0027s age.\u0027\\n\\n Scrawdyke was going to say something, but DeBoys slapped the back of his head, stirring up an unwashed bird\u0027s nest of hair. Reluctantly, Scrawdyke didn\u0027t press his point. Technically, she wasn\u0027t an elder, but she let it ride.\\n\\n Croft leaned back like a guest on Dee Time, waiting for a question to prompt an anecdote. She\u0027d asked for an interview after all. Croft set it up as a performance piece.\\n\\n \u0027\"A profound change\", you said,\u0027 she began. \u0027I believe you meant the Dracula Declaration changed us all.\u0027\\n\\n Croft nodded. \u0027Obviously,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m interested in what you changed from, Professor Croft. The vampire you were when the world didn\u0027t believe in vampires.\u0027\\n\\n He was wary. As I said, I was an itinerant... a ghost of myself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why didn\u0027t you take back your name? Most did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Charles Croydon was dead. His life gone. Part of the past.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Forgive me if this seems indelicate, but how did he feed? Charles Croydon?\u0027\\n\\n As a predator feeds,\u0027 he said. \u0027By fascination or force. You must dig this. We are all vampires here.\u0027\\n\\n Anna Franklyn\u0027s head oscillated like a cobra\u0027s. James Eastman ground his fangs.\\n\\n \u0027The practicalities were different,\u0027 she said. \u0027When you couldn\u0027t admit what you were, when there were no socially acceptable ways of drinking blood.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Social acceptability is an artificial construct. We are far beyond those. By our nature.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Our nature as vampires?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Our nature as predators.\u0027\\n\\n The living - she couldn\u0027t even think of the expression \u0027the warm\u0027 - Lord Charles Croydon had been exactly like the vampire Caleb Croft. Only money and influence saved him from being strung up in Hanging Woods. \u0027By fascination or force.\u0027 She knew what he meant. He was a murderer and a rapist. Frilly shirts and bright shoe-buckles didn\u0027t make him any less a thug. Turning enabled him to predate on a larger scale. Centuries on, he was an old murderer and a rapist. He survived by growing cautious and adapting to the times. But how easy was it to stop being an unrestrained monster? If Croft thought he\u0027d get away with it, he\u0027d use and dispose of Carol Thatcher and Laura Bellows in a trice. But could he think he\u0027d get away with it?\\n\\n \u0027You were born with a title. Do you still feel entitled?\u0027\\n\\n Croft wasn\u0027t rising to that. \u0027That\u0027sjust wordplay,\u0027 he said. \u0027Sophistry, man. We\u0027re beyond that here. I expected better of you. Reed, as I get your vibe, you\u0027ve always wanted to be equal... equal with whom?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I remember when women didn\u0027t have the vote.\u0027\\n\\n Scrawdyke put his hand up, was ignored, and put it down again, yawning to pretend he just wanted a stretch.\\n\\n \u0027So, you want to be equal with men? Cool. And, since you\u0027re Irish, equal with the English, right? Under the law...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In Ulster, right now, the rights of the Catholic minority are...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you\u0027re not Catholic. You\u0027re the daughter of Dr Pierce Plunkett Reed, of Trinity College and King\u0027s, London. A Dublin Protestant. an Ascendancy Prod, right?\u0027\\n\\n She admitted it.\\n\\n \u0027And, darling girl, you\u0027re a vampire. You are not equal, you can\u0027t be equal. You have risen above.\u0027\\n\\n Croft swivelled in his chair, and addressed his circle.\\n\\n \u0027Friends, get this: Katharine Reed is still here, eighty years A.D. Consider the Galapagos turtle. They can live for centuries. Like us. But they hatch in the sea and new-borns have to crawl across the beach to safety. Sea birds, predators, haunt the beach, and snatch - how many hatchlings? Five in ten, nine in ten? It\u0027s a feeding frenzy. Carnage. The slaughter of a generation. Of the weak, or the unlucky, or the unwary. It was like that for new-borns in the wake of the Dracula Declaration. Most didn\u0027t make it across the beach. Kate Reed did. Study her, learn her secret. It may save your life.\u0027\\n\\n She was uncomfortable. DeBoys eyed her wolfishly.\\n\\n Anna - who was Kate\u0027s age or older - looked at the floor. Croft had never made a turtle speech about her, evidently.\\n\\n Of course, in this story, the Professor was the butcher bird. Some new-borns of the 1880s succumbed to disease or carelessness. Not a few were killed in the Terror. The regime\u0027s chief shrike was Caleb Croft.\\n\\n \u0027What is your secret?\u0027 asked Armstrong, notebook ready.\\n\\n \u0027\"Diet and lots of sleep\",\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s from Elisabeth Bathory\u0027s paperback,\u0027 said Mo?se.\\n\\n \u0027And she took it from Herbert von Krolock,\u0027 Kate responded. \u0027Almost all the witty things ascribed to vampire socialites are Herbert bon mots passed around and polished up. Most of us lose the ability to be funny after a century or so. If an elder makes a joke, he usually has to say \"ho ho ho\" afterwards to be sure you know to laugh.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Point of etiquette,\u0027 said Scrawdyke. \u0027Generalisations are unhelpful. Give specific instances.\u0027\\n\\n She smiled and shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve ducked the question, luv,\u0027 said Keith Kenneth. Or was he Kenneth Keith? \u0027Keeping your secret?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It wouldn\u0027t be a secret if I blabbed everywhere, would it?\u0027\\n\\n If Kate had a secret, she didn\u0027t know what it was. Not of the Dracula bloodline, she escaped the rot which cut down many of her generation, but it wasn\u0027t as if she was particularly careful. She\u0027d put herself in harm\u0027s way often. Too often. How many times can you be sole survivor of some catastrophe and shrug it off? On the principle that a tightrope walker shouldn\u0027t look down, she didn\u0027t like to consider the occasions when she\u0027d nearly tumbled.\\n\\n Even now, she was in a lions\u0027 den, taking questions from cubs.\\n\\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t take me as an example,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Armstrong wrote that down.\\n\\n \u0027What are your thoughts on the Before?\u0027 asked DeBoys.\\n\\n \u0027Point of explanation,\u0027 said Scrawdyke. \u0027DeBoys means...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know what he means,\u0027 she said, hastily. \u0027B.D. Before Dracula. I had little experience of it. We didn\u0027t know what was coming. It wasn\u0027t like decimal coinage. We weren\u0027t told the thing would happen, given a date to expect it by and charts in the papers to learn so you\u0027re ready for it. When I was a girl, when I was warm, we\u0027d barely heard of vampires. They weren\u0027t even worth not believing in. Angels or ghosts or the soul or a truly good man. we talked often about whether those existed. My father wrote A Counterblast to Agnosticism. He was one Protestant who took the \"protest\" part seriously. He had decided opinions on Irish beliefs. At a meeting of the Home Rule League, he told Parnell that Ireland would never be a nation until we stopped wittering on about the wee folk. He had no patience with the Celtic folklore with which some Nationalists dressed up the Cause. Before the Dracula Declaration, vampires seemed like fairies. Children\u0027s stories. The scholars who credited them, Calmet or Hesselius or Abronsius, were marginal crackpots. One thing which happened A.D. was a revival of all manner of nonsensical beliefs on the principle of \"if there are vampires, then why could there not be...\" boggarts or gorgons or the Easter Rabbit or two-headed llamas? That took a while to die out. There are modern equivalents of such foolishness, like flying saucers or the vanishing police box.\u0027\\n\\n If more people knew about the Mother of Tears, the epidemic of credulousness might take fire again. That was the least of the reasons why Kate hadn\u0027t written about the creature who secretly ruled Rome.\\n\\n Scrawdyke tried to put up his hand, but several of the others stopped him.\\n\\n \u0027So you admit you can\u0027t understand what it was like for Caleb B.D.?\u0027\\n\\n DeBoys used Croft\u0027s Christian name. The name he had taken. Why Caleb? Was the former Charles Croydon sticking with his initials? Vampires often did that, so their names matched the initials on their luggage. Or else they went in for anagrams like \u0027Carmilla\u0027 or \u0027Alucard\u0027. Croft might be working his way through Bible names. Caleb of the Tribe of Judah was one of the spies Moses sent into Canaan, who came back and said the land could be taken.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I can understand,\u0027 she said. \u0027I can understand what it was like - what it is like - for a lot of people in a lot of situations. It\u0027s called empathy. A trait not often associated with vampires and virtually absent in elders.\u0027\\n\\n DeBoys grinned.\\n\\n \u0027...but it has its uses.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There were glories in the old days,\u0027 said DeBoys. \u0027When there was more of a nightly challenge... when we - vampires - weren\u0027t so common...\u0027\\n\\n The Black Monks would defend their Black Abbot, of course.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t expect to hear that at a university. Aren\u0027t children today into throwing off the dead weight of history? It\u0027s the time of the season, the age of Aquarius, the Now Generation, the Happening Thing. Aren\u0027t you with-it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mr DeBoys follows his own course,\u0027 said Croft. With pride, or resignation, or. something else?\\n\\n \u0027And we follow it with him,\u0027 said Withnail, smirking to show he saw the joke in that. \u0027Black Monks all, and hellfire to quaff...\u0027\\n\\n All the students snapped their fingers. A private joke. A prearranged response to a trigger phrase.\\n\\n Scrawdyke snapped so hard he broke bones. He winced, gripping the finger while it healed.\\n\\n Eastman, a hold-out against the joke, scowled. Kate decided she liked him.\\n\\n Croft allowed himself an indulgent smile. She\u0027d forgotten how disgusting that was.\\n\\n \u0027What are the Black Monks?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n DeBoys\u0027 fangs glinted. \u0027We are vampires among vampires,\u0027 he said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-46.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) \\n Rome. 1959.
