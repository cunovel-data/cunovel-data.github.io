She did all the stupid things she\u0027d seen people do when barracked by reporters. She flung her hands over her face, looked down at her shoes, and tried to walk on an invisible straight line through the crowd. She didn\u0027t so much as snap \u0027no comment\u0027 in answer to increasingly blunt and impolite questions tossed at her like grapples. She must have looked guilty as Judas.\\n\\n Kate got back to the pensione just in time to be thrown out. The press had been there too and got a lot of interview material from the landlady\u0027s family about what a suspicious foreign slut she was. She hadn\u0027t slept in Trastevere more than twice since arriving in Rome. She\u0027d spent most of her time at Marcello\u0027s apartment, with Charles and Genevieve, out on the street, or in prison. Nevertheless, she was required to settle an inflated bill to get her suitcase back.\\n\\n She tried to telephone Marcello at his apartment but got no answer. She trudged up and down Via Veneto, but couldn\u0027t find him in any of his usual haunts.\\n\\n Of course, she realised Marcello had told the other reporters about her. It was how they had been able to lay in wait outside the police station. It was also presumably why he hadn\u0027t been there. Apart from anything that might have been between them, she was a story and he ought to have been there to get it. At least he had enough gumption to be ashamed of putting her on the spot.\\n\\n She still planned on taking it out on him.\\n\\n While she had been in prison, the mood of the city had changed. The Via Veneto wasn\u0027t as abandoned as before, except in the sense that a great many had abandoned it for somewhere else. The Cafe Strega was almost deserted. The elder vampires were gone, and quite a few new-borns were making themselves scarce. If the Crimson Executioner wanted the undead out of the city, he\u0027d scored a triumph.\\n\\n She sat in the cafe, sipping blood. To her relief, no one bothered her. The feeding frenzy over her story had passed, and someone else would be haring around with the press at their heels. The police had announced that she was not a suspect in the death of Prince Dracula. That left the press free to speculate on increasingly bizarre conspiracies. She liked the one about the Carpathian guardsman brainwashed by the Red Chinese and transformed into a vampire slayer, though she was a lot more likely to believe it was all down to the Jesuits.\\n\\n Charles was gone, and now Dracula too. Her past was being dismantled. One man she had loved, the other hated, but they had defined a world she understood. A world in which she had a place, a cause, duties, ties. The cords that fixed her in the universe were being snipped one at a time.\\n\\n Was this how elders came to feel? In time, everything they remembered from life passed. They alone remained, locked into their skulls, lost in a world of pop-up toasters and television advertisements.\\n\\n She felt very small and not a little afraid.\\n\\n \u0027The answers to such mysteries are very often found under the soles of our shoes.\u0027\\n\\n Father Merrin\u0027s comment stuck in her mind. He had placed a subtle emphasis on the sentence. It was something he\u0027d intended she should remember, should think about.\\n\\n What was under the soles of her shoes?\\n\\n Tiles. None too clean.\\n\\n And beneath that?\\n\\n Eventually, earth and rock and magma.\\n\\n There were catacombs, ruins, caves, lairs, cells, basements. Even nightclubs. She kept being taken underground. Rome was like an iceberg. Only a fraction was on the surface.\\n\\n What lived under Rome?\\n\\n Or who?\\n\\n \u0027There are tears everywhere,\u0027 Santona had said. \u0027The stones of the city pour forth tears.\u0027\\n\\n She remembered Santona too, her talk of Mater Lachrymarum, the Mother of Tears. The fortune-teller implied a link between this mysterious person and the girl who\u0027d led Kate into Dracula\u0027s tomb. The child\u0027s pretty, evil face appeared to her still. Everything else might die here in Rome but the little girl would live on. Kate had a sense she was an ancient creature: not a vampire, but an elemental, something eternal and dreadful.\\n\\n A mother must have a daughter. She kept coming back to that. Santona had said Mater Lachrymarum was not the girl\u0027s mother, but the city\u0027s.\\n\\n How could Rome have a mother? According to Kate\u0027s old classics teacher, the city had two fathers, Romulus and Remus. No mother was mentioned, unless it was the wolf bitch who suckled the twins.\\n\\n Something stirred in her heart. Not just terror, but curiosity, a need to know, to understand. It was a song she\u0027d heard since her warm days, perhaps the overriding melody of her life.\\n\\n Charles\u0027s death had knocked her out of herself. But perhaps Dracula\u0027s passing had slapped her back on course. There was something new mixed in, a tune she\u0027d never heard before. In a sense she didn\u0027t want to contemplate yet, she was free. Without Dracula, the world was free to make of itself what it wished. And without Charles, so was she.\\n\\n She wept hot tears.\\n\\n She was not yet ready to be this free, this alone. It was like leaving school, leaving home, leaving society. To have no rules or measures, to have nothing but herself.\\n\\n Her tears dried.\\n\\n \u0027Kate,\u0027 someone said, laying hands on hers, sitting down at the table.\\n\\n She thought it might be Marcello. Despite her annoyance at him, her heart leaped.\\n\\n It was Genevieve. She tried not to be disappointed.\\n\\n \u0027Kate, how are you? I hadn\u0027t heard they\u0027d let you out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 she said, pulling in her hands.\\n\\n \u0027You wouldn\u0027t believe the day I\u0027ve had,\u0027 Genevieve said. She signalled a waiter with one hand. \u0027They had me identify Dracula\u0027s head.\u0027\\n\\n Kate cringed in sympathy.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not rotted,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027That\u0027s baffling everyone. Age is supposed to catch up with elders when they die. Most of the Crimson Executioner\u0027s victims are heaps of funny-coloured dust. But Dracula looks fresh.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Next thing, they\u0027ll be saying he\u0027s a saint. Some are supposed to resist corruption.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Everything that could be said about Dracula has been said, trust me. You should have seen the newspapers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been catching up. It\u0027s amazing how violent death ennobles some folk. All those people seething with hatred last week can turn around sincerely and pay tribute to a great statesman and significant figure in twentieth century history. Surely someone else must have reacted to the news by singing \"Ding-Dong, the Witch is Dead\" and wearing a lampshade.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve\u0027s drink arrived and she ordered one for Kate.\\n\\n They looked at each other, not sure what to say.\\n\\n \u0027I miss him,\u0027 Genevieve admitted finally.\\n\\n Kate nodded. \u0027Me too.\u0027\\n\\n They did not mean Dracula.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what I thought it\u0027d be like,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027It\u0027s not as if I\u0027m not used to people dying off around me. It\u0027s just that Charles was so there, if you know what I mean.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I do.\u0027\\n\\n It was a good thing Kate was cried out.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s too much mystery left, Kate. Charles would have hated that. The Crimson Executioner and your little girl. And Dracula. Who killed Dracula?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It wasn\u0027t me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It should have been. In a way, I wish I had killed him. I wish I could have cut through all the compromises and decided this man did not deserve to live any longer, then stabbed him through the heart and cut off his head. I can see myself doing it, but I know I didn\u0027t. I don\u0027t know whether to feel guilty about not saving him or not killing him. I still feel his blood on me, under my skin.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If I can help, Kate, I will.\u0027\\n\\n She took Genevieve\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s someone I want to visit, to talk with. Will you come with me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It means going somewhere our kind aren\u0027t welcome.\u0027\\n\\n Genevieve was puzzled for a moment, then understood. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-27.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) \\n Rome. 1959.
