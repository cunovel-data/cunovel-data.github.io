{"id":93176,"no":51,"title":"Page 51","content":"She needed to crash. Besides all the excitement, she\u0027d spent too much time in the sun lately. With a pint and a half in her, she was drowsy. Not in the best shape to drive, though there was no breathalyser for vampires.\n She switched on the car radio and caught the BBC news headlines. The well-spoken announcer quoted Bellaver as giving \u0027no comment\u0027 about the death in custody of Peter Craven. Donna Rogers wasn\u0027t mentioned, though a woman was said to be \u0027helping police with their enquiries\u0027. As if to remind her that the rest of the world was a mess too, the other stories were about the incident at My Lai in Vietnam which the US army were not calling a massacre; the arrests of the assassins of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King; and a strike by women workers at the Ford car factory in Dagenham. Kate wished she was covering that. She\u0027d written about the match girls\u0027 strike of 1888, and conditions hadn\u0027t changed enough since then.\n Kate kept the wireless on, to fight off sleep. After the news was a repeat of last night\u0027s The Bowmans, the long-running serial (\u0027an everyday story of country folk\u0027) with the irritating theme music. Since Sister George rose from the grave, and Fenella Fielding took over the role, the show had become more and more focused on its token vampire, though this episode was all about brucellosis at Bowman Farm and the vicar\u0027s shoplifting habit. Television soap operas The Northern Barstows, Cowley Mansions and Crossroads all followed The Bowmans by bringing in domineering female vampire characters - always played by warm actresses with false fangs.\n She got back to Holloway Road and parked her Mini in the hard-fought-for space outside her flat. Collecting a sheaf of post she could afford to ignore until later, she went upstairs and let herself in. Her flat was one large room used as study and crypt, with a small kitchen area marked off by a bar, and a separate bathroom. Many vampires would use the bath as a coffin, but she liked to soak and think sometimes. She kept a sleeping board in the main room, surrounded by book-piles. As soon as she stepped inside, the fuzziness in her head became thicker. She saw grey spots - a sign of impending lassitude. She lowered and locked the blinds, expelling light from the flat. She took off the clothes she\u0027d been wearing too long and put on pyjamas. In the bathroom, she used the loo and cleaned her teeth. A framed Aubrey Beardsley print hung above the sink where the mirror had been.\n She lay on her sleeping board. The lights went out.\n Technically, vampire lassitude was deep coma, not temporary death.\n No dreams, though. Vampires didn\u0027t dream. Warm critics who said vampires would never create harped on about that.\n Two days later, at nightfall - well past nine o\u0027clock - her eyes opened.\n She sat up on her board and found she wasn\u0027t alone. Nezumi perched on a bar-stool. An anglepoise light was on and she was reading Bunty. Someone lay senseless and face-down on the carpet. A young, warm woman. Shaggy blonde hair and a long white dress. Barefoot and bleeding a little.\n \u0027What did I miss?\u0027 Kate asked.\n Nezumi solemnly folded the corner of a page and shut her comic.\n \u0027The flattened filly is Jessica,\u0027 Nezumi said. \u0027I had to slosh her on the noggin. She was carrying this. For you.\u0027\n Nezumi picked up a sharpened stick.\n Kate was alarmed. She must remember to thank Richard Jeperson for providing a bodyguard.\n Refreshed, Kate sprung up. She crouched by Jessica.\n \u0027Did you kill her?\u0027\n \u0027No. Just packed her off to Bedfordshire for a forty winks.\u0027\n Kate stood and went to the bar. A fringed leather shoulder bag she didn\u0027t recognise was plumped on the counter, contents removed and arranged neatly.\n \u0027Who is she again?\u0027 Kate asked.\n \u0027Jessica Van Helsing,\u0027 said Nezumi, holding up a student union card. \u0027You met her grandfather last night.\u0027\n So, the feud was passed down to another generation.\n \u0027This isn\u0027t going to end, is it? Did she come to kill me?\u0027\n \u0027Not seriously, I suppose. She hummed and hahed and bit her lip like a clot for minutes. And she didn\u0027t prepare properly. She forgot to bring a hammer. To be on the safe side, I tapped her on the bean to make sure she couldn\u0027t give you a poke with a sharp stick.\u0027\n \u0027Thanks.\u0027\n \u0027Anything for a chum,\u0027 said Nezumi.\n Jessica Van Helsing moaned, stirred and tried to push up. Nezumi reached idly for her hockey stick.\n \u0027Do you like her hair?\u0027 asked Nezumi. \u0027I mean, not now, with blood in it, but in general... ? I was thinking of going blonde. For a lark.\u0027\n Kate pulled on a dressing gown.\n \u0027We better take care of the silly goose,\u0027 she said.\n Kate and Nezumi turned Jessica over. The tang of leaking blood hit both their palates at the same time and their fangs flicked out. They giggled and wrestled the warm girl onto the sleeping board.\n Jessica\u0027s eyes fluttered open. She saw two vampires looming over her. Her face started to contort.\n \u0027Please don\u0027t scream, dear,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027Would you like a cup of tea? It\u0027ll have to be lemon. I\u0027ve not got milk in.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll brew up,\u0027 said Nezumi, flitting into the kitchen area. She knew where everything was.\n Kate had forgotten the Japanese girl was an elder. She was so fast.\n Jessica put her hand to her head and said, \u0027I could murder a cuppa.\u0027\n \u0027Be thankful that\u0027s the only thing you\u0027re murdering, girl,\u0027 said Kate, twiddling Jessica\u0027s stake. \u0027What on Earth were you thinking?\u0027\n \u0027Sorry. It\u0027s Granddad. He\u0027s locked up... he left instructions for... well, for reprisals.\u0027\n \u0027No offence, but your granddad is a loon.\u0027\n \u0027A gibbering loon,\u0027 Nezumi elaborated.\n Jessica was embarrassed. \u0027I know, I know... it didn\u0027t used to be so bad, but when he lost his job because of vampires, he went potty... and when I started seeing Paul, he went pottier...\u0027\n \u0027Paul?\u0027\n \u0027Paul Durward. He\u0027s a Karnstein, twice removed.\u0027\n Jessica\u0027s eyes and cheeks shone when she mentioned her beau. Kate knew who Durward was. Blond and too pretty. Knee-britches, tight weskits and ruffle-shirts had come back into fashion and let him enjoy a third or fourth stab at golden youth. He\u0027d signed with Decca and recorded an album of folk-inflected covers (\u0027Season of the Witch\u0027, \u0027House of the Rising Moon\u0027, \u0027Quinn the Eskimo\u0027). He had a three-octave range but little character. Paul Durward was not only a vampire with no reflection; he was a vampire with no echo. He\u0027d been at Syrie Van Epp\u0027s party. Kate realised she\u0027d seen Jess in the crowd photographs, too. The blonde with the cleavage.\n The girl had new and old love-bites.\n Kate dug out a first-aid kit and treated Jess\u0027s head-wound. She\u0027d have a lump and an ache but nothing permanent.\n \u0027You\u0027re not in the Circle of Light?\u0027 Kate asked the girl. \u0027Pledged to destroy all vampires?\u0027\n \u0027Far from it. I think vampires are dreamy.\u0027\n Kate\u0027s kettle whistled a shrill comment. Nezumi brought over a stoneware teapot Kate had bought from a craft shop in Somerset and what cups she could find. Kate feared her crockery wouldn\u0027t satisfy a Japanese anglophile. Nezumi poured tea into a mug with a Mondrian design, a plastic beaker salvaged from a broken thermos flask and the last surviving china teacup from Kate\u0027s mother\u0027s Sunday set.\n \u0027So what\u0027s up with the stake?\u0027\n Jessica couldn\u0027t say. She was a sheltered twit, but not essentially malign.\n \u0027Why\u0027s it all so complicated?\u0027 Jessica asked, and burst into tears.\n Kate hugged the girl, gingerly. Jess presented her neck shyly, which Kate pointedly ignored. What kind of creature did this girl take her for?\n So Lorrimer Van Helsing\u0027s granddaughter was going out with a viper? He must take ribbing about that in FVK circles, what with his endless speeches about avenging the wrong done to his beheaded ancestor. Vampire haters always went on about monsters \u0027coming for our women\u0027. If they spent less time fulminating, maybe \u0027their women\u0027 wouldn\u0027t be so inclined to seek out a fang on the side. Kate suspected the Circle of Light was at bottom a neurotic response to this affront. The Professor\u0027s grudge probably began with minor sleights, like Caleb Croft getting a nicer office and invitations to bunfests with the Vice-Chancellor, then escalated until it seemed vampires were behind all his disappointments. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-51.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) \n Rome. 1959.
