{"id":93156,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"PENELOPE PULLS IT OFF It was time to depart in prosperity. The household was packing up, for disposal. The host was truly dead and the other guests had fled. Tom considered the Van Goghs, but they were too large and well-known to be practical souvenirs of his happy summer at the Palazzo Otranto. Over the months, he\u0027d built up a collection. The dead strewed their treasures any which way. Working by day, when elders were in their caskets and new-borns lulled with last night\u0027s blood, he\u0027d harvested select, portable items. A bird of prey statuette, ugly but valuable; an Egyptian ruby scarab, with seven pinpoint flaws in the pattern of the big dipper; a tiny, withered brown hand which might be a child\u0027s or a chimp\u0027s; a model of the Eiffel Tower in pure gold; a dear little Corot no bigger than an icon. An enormous fellow Tom knew in Amsterdam might be able to do something with the loot; he was a collector and a dealer in rare, unprovenanced artifacts. He did not, of course, hide his haul in his room where it might count as evidence. He\u0027d found a loose floorboard in a forgotten attic and made himself a hidey-hole. If the cache were discovered, servants would be blamed. In his time, a butler and two maids had been dismissed for pilferage. Princess Asa insisted they be branded on their foreheads. Did a facial scar that read \u0027thief\u0027 in Moldavian hamper chances of future employment in Europe? Presently, Asa was mad. She\u0027d always been mad, he supposed, but the quality of her madness had changed. She was no longer the imperious monster. Penelope called her \u0027Princess Havisham\u0027 behind her back. She wore her ragged wedding dress and aged years every day she refrained from drinking blood. At the end of the month, she\u0027d have to find a new house to haunt. It was about midday. He was on a last look around. Some of the recently flown dead had carelessly left behind items of value. In General Iorga\u0027s crypt-like cell, he found a silver dagger. An old weapon, not like the bland scalpel they\u0027d found in Dracula\u0027s heart. The workmanship was fine, the edge keen. This was an assassin\u0027s knife. It struck him again how odd it was that so many of the dead owned silver knick-knacks. The metal was poison to them. It was either an ostentatious defiance of mortality or a need to have weapons for use against their own kind. With Dracula gone, there\u0027d be secret wars of succession. Penelope had lectured him about it, suggesting with not a little relish that half the surviving elders would perish in the internecine squabbles. And a good job too, she said; it was time the mediaeval barbarians made way for rising generations. He pocketed the dagger, wondering if he should keep the thing. More and more dead were about. And Penelope Churchward might have long arms. He made his way to the attic, carrying an empty suitcase he had found in one of the guest rooms. It was just the right size. He carefully packed his souvenirs, wrapping them in scarves. It was vulgar to set a price on such things, but he estimated he had enough to set him up for a good few years. He thought about France. It was time to make a home. Whistling, he hauled the case - heavy, but not impossible - downstairs. He\u0027d take the Ferrari, but only as far as the Stazione Centrale. It was too flashy, too easy to trace. The case became heavier on the second staircase. He switched to his left hand and dropped it. Tom realised how weak he\u0027d become. His neck-wounds, ragged and swollen, throbbed like mosquito bites. He made fists and flexed his arms, fighting the tingling in his depleted veins. His elbows and knees didn\u0027t quite work. The suitcase slithered down to the next landing. Tom stumbled after it. There was only the main staircase to the hallway, then the front door. He took hold of the case\u0027s handle, but couldn\u0027t lift it. He considered jettisoning one of the heavier items - the falcon, perhaps? - but rejected the idea as absurd. This was his nest egg. He hugged the suitcase to his chest like a sack of potatoes and stood. It was like lifting an anchor. The weight pulled him to the lip of the stairs. His vision blurred. A dizzy spell struck. He wanted to pitch himself down the stairs and break his own silly neck. His hip struck the balustrade and the case balanced on the long marble sweep. Tom smiled. It could slide the case down this last staircase, letting the bannisters take the weight. He deserved this loot. He deserved the life it\u0027d buy him. Concentrating to make his feet and ankles do their work without interfering with each other, he went down step by step, case sliding easily beside him. When he was through the front door, he\u0027d never look back. And he\u0027d never let a dead woman near him again. \u0027Where do you think you\u0027re going, Mr American?\u0027 Penelope\u0027s voice wasn\u0027t raised, but it rang in his head. He turned, mind not catching up. The case got free and slithered down the bannisters like a prankish small child, then ski-jumped across the hallway and made a bad landing, bursting open. Treasures glittered. Tom sank to his knees, gripping the balustrade himself. He couldn\u0027t raise his eyes to Penelope\u0027s face. He felt her looking down at him. \u0027You were not given permission,\u0027 she said. His chin hit the stairs and he lost his grip. He rolled over, breathing heavily, and looked up at a fuzzy, distant ceiling. He exposed his throat to the dead woman. Her face appeared, upside-down. He had only one chance to escape. One treasure he had not packed in the case. Penelope knelt by him and stroked his hair, as affectionately as she might pet a dog. She leaned forward to kiss - to bite - his neck. Tom stuck the dagger he\u0027d pocketed into Penelope\u0027s ribs. But her side wasn\u0027t where he thought it would be. She twisted easily away from the silver blade. Her thumb and forefinger pinched his wrist, digging enough to jolt pain through his whole arm, numbing it from fingertips to shoulder. The dagger fell out of his hand. \u0027So, our vampire killer is exposed.\u0027 Doors opened and people came into the hall, boots thumping on marble. \u0027Inspector Silvestri,\u0027 Penelope said. \u0027Good afternoon.\u0027 Tom\u0027s mind was fuzz and fudge. \u0027There\u0027s such a thing as being too clever, Tom dear,\u0027 Penelope whispered. She kissed him on the cheek, fondly. Her rough tongue licked him from chin to eyebrow, like sandpaper scouring one side of his face. Penelope helped him stand up and walked him down. Silvestri stood in the doorway. Sergeant Ginko and a uniformed policeman went through the case, cooing and whistling at each discovery. \u0027Pick that horrid thing up, would you?\u0027 Penelope asked the always-lurking Klove, indicating the dropped dagger. \u0027It\u0027s another one of those silver knives.\u0027 The swirl of incomprehension began to resolve itself into a picture Tom didn\u0027t care for. Klove fetched the dagger. \u0027Signor,\u0027 began Silvestri, \u0027this does not look well for you.\u0027 Was this about Dickie? Penelope handed him over to a couple of cops. They took his arms, practically holding him up. He tried to think it over, to see how he had reached to this predicament. \u0027You\u0027ve quite come to my rescue, Inspector,\u0027 said Penelope, voice trembling to conceal her steel core. \u0027I fear I\u0027ve had a very close escape. I never suspected we were harbouring one of those fanatics. A vampire slayer.\u0027 Silvestri took the silver dagger from Klove. Others were up on the landing, above Penelope. Servants. And a white spectre. \u0027Could it be this was the hand that struck the blow?\u0027 Penelope wondered. Why couldn\u0027t anyone else see she was acting? Were they all blinded by her power of fascination? His bites stung. He wanted her mouth on his neck, her tongue in the wounds. \u0027That question will be answered, Signorina Churchward,\u0027 said the policeman. \u0027For now, we shall arrest him for assault upon your person and the attempted thefts. Our investigations have turned up other questionable affairs, in New York City and Greece. Scotland Yard are involved. The other matter requires further investigation.\u0027 The other matter? Tom couldn\u0027t stretch his mind around the phrase. What did they mean by it? The white spectre flew at him, all teeth and nails and frayed lace. She screeched and went for his eyes and throat. \u0027Murderer!\u0027 Asa screamed. \u0027Regicide!\u0027 Penelope gently took hold of Asa, and forced her to withdraw her hands. The Princess\u0027s face was close to Tom\u0027s, eyes enormous and insane. \u0027You killed Dracula! You will die!\u0027 Only Asa showed emotion. Penelope and the cops carried the scene off as if it were a conventional conversation on a trivial matter. Penelope gentled Asa, whispering in her ear, sorting out her matted hair. \u0027She has suffered a great deal,\u0027 Penelope explained. \u0027We understand,\u0027 said Silvestri. Tom was tugged toward the doors. Outside, under the glare of the sun, a police car waited. He\u0027d never drive the Ferrari again. \u0027May I have a moment?\u0027 Penelope asked. She passed Asa on to a servant. Silvestri thought it over, and nodded. The policemen let Tom\u0027s arms go. He was so weak he could hardly stand, let alone make a break for daylight. Penelope stood in front of him. She spoke quietly \u0027Tom, Tom, I can\u0027t say how sorry I am it has come to this. You\u0027re not as bad as they\u0027ll say, and you\u0027re certainly no worse than anyone here. For what it\u0027s worth, I don\u0027t believe you killed Dracula. There was no gain in it for you, and you don\u0027t murder unless by your lights you really truly have to. But you\u0027ll seem so perfect when the story of your Greek adventure comes out, so right for the role, that I fear nothing you can say or do will dissuade them. This has been a public affair, and someone must take the role of villain. Take comfort in the fact that the world will remember your name, and that I shall always think fondly of you. Not the Tom who\u0027ll be the famous vampire slayer, nor the Tom you\u0027d have liked us to think you were - the affable, shallow, sincere American - but the cold, sharp man inside. I know you won\u0027t appreciate it much, but I am very fond of your true self. In other circumstances, I should have been honoured to make you my get.\u0027 She kissed him on the lips. No teeth, no tongue. When she broke the kiss, a jewel glinted in her eye. She wiped it away His heart was ice. The trap was sprung. \u0027You may take him away now,\u0027 Penelope decreed. The cops marched him out of the palazzo. Summer sun fell on his face. His eyes shrank and his skin tingled. He realised how badly he had been bled.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-31.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) Rome. 1959.
