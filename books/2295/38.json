{"id":93163,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"AQUARIUS Chapter 1 Sunday morning, before nine. A godly hour, the smug might say. Church bells were pealing in Greenwich and Blackheath. Merciless June. A cloudless sky. Blazing sun. Shade hard to find. Like most vampires, Kate Reed was no fan of early summer. Nights passed in seconds, days crawled for a week. Her cheeks and the backs of her hands tingled with the beginnings of burns. She ought to be senseless in her tightly curtained flat, cocooned under her continental quilt. Ideally, she\u0027d be in the Southern Hemisphere. Grass shone golden-green, as if coated with reflective paint. She had a choice: oversize el cheapo sunglasses and calming turquoise blur or clear National Health specs and headache-making focus. Prescription shades, her idea of decadent luxury, cost what she made in a month. A good month. For a while, she\u0027d got through daylight with the home-made option: granny glasses, tinted with felt-tip pen. Those got trampled by a police horse outside the American Embassy. The Guardian spiked her copy on the Grosvenor Square demo. Too partisan. And where was the vampire angle? Editors looked to her for that. This morning, there was a vampire angle. So she could sell it... ...if the papers had room for a little murder. Monday: Andy Warhol shot in New York... Wednesday: Robert Kennedy killed in California... Yesterday: James Earl Ray, assassin of Martin Luther King, arrested at Heathrow Airport... Ongoing death tolls: Vietnam, Biafra, K?r. Soviet tanks massing on the Transylvania border. American riot cops loaded for bear in Watts, Selma and Jerusalem\u0027s Lot. France preparing an above-ground Gamma Bomb test on Bali Ha\u0027i. The Troubles kicking off again in Belfast. That was the week, that was... Twelve months ago, 1967 - the year of The Monkees. The Summer of Love. Kate had certainly been in love last summer. Twice. Not concurrently. She wasn\u0027t that kind of girl, or hadn\u0027t been so far. Now, 1968 - the Year of the Monkey. The Summer of Something Else. The Burning Season? She\u0027d lost the taste of last year\u0027s loves: a warm Hells\u0027 Angel, Frank Mills, and a vampire vicar, Algernon Ford. Neither trustworthy, both \u0027trips\u0027... as the young were saying. The young also said \u0027never trust anyone over a hundred and thirty\u0027. She wasn\u0027t that old. Yet. It was coming down. The Age of Aquarius. The Permissive Society. The Kali-Yuga. The Revolution. Flower Power. Helter Skelter. The Hallucination Generation. Fear and Loathing. The White Heat of Technology. The Green Green Grass of Home. No more water. the fire next time. Jesus Saves... with the Woolwich. Go to work on an egg! Burn, baby, burn! Commercialisation. Radicalisation. Decimalisation. People who\u0027d been excited or apprehensive were now elated or terrified. It was no longer enough to report news. Journalists had to anticipate, comment on breaking waves, name and package trends for general consumption. She was writing more for New Worlds than The Grauniad. Michael Moorcock, the editor, encouraged her to chronicle the New Terror. He reminded her of Frank Harris, her father-in-darkness, but was a much better writer. Mike coaxed something half-decent out of her. Along with the porny purple passages of Horatio Stubbs\u0027s serial Harelipped in the Bed, her supposedly inflammatory piece lost NW its Arts Council grant. She was still waiting to be paid. Mike was rattling out Seaton Begg paperbacks for rhino to plough back into the magazine. She needed fashion commissions from Woman or Compact to pay the rent. Unless they came through, she\u0027d have to ghost \u0027confessions\u0027 to go between pin-ups in Bikini Girl or Wow Magazine. \u0027I Was a \"Groupie Girl\" for a Gore-Crazed Groover!\u0027 \u0027House of Thwacks!\u0027 \u0027Soho After Sunset!\u0027 Squinting through Tizer-bottle specs, she acclimatised to the glare. She was in Greenwich, just outside Maryon Park. Some students wanted to use the tennis courts. They were kept back by blue-uniformed, tit-helmeted policemen. As soon as she saw fuzz, Kate realised she was dressed like a burglar: black pocketless fly-on-the-thigh trousers, horizontally striped black and orange t-shirt with a cartoon bee on the front, black plimsolls, slightly ratty grey cardigan with sleeves long enough to cover her hands, oversized black peaked cap with a pom-pom. Her shoulder-bag wasn\u0027t labelled \u0027SWAG\u0027, but was cavernous enough to stash loot. She showed her press-card. Fred Regent, a young plod she knew, let her pass. Kate was expected. A posh athlete complained and was ignored. This was once Hanging Woods, a haunt of highwaymen. Then, Charlton Sandpits. Now, the place was tamed. One of those leafy public spaces the English loved to keep tidy but would prefer people not use. No litter, no dogs, no children, no vampires. A familiar, alien place, like the abandoned suburbs, cracked launch-pads and drained swimming pools J.B. Graham wrote about in New Worlds. So quiet you wouldn\u0027t know you were in a city. Keeping to the path, she passed the tennis courts and walked over a gentle hill. The park was mostly grassy slopes, trees straining against dark green slat fences. She saw people near the treeline. A copper got in her way, gauntlet out in sign language for \u0027stop in the name of the law\u0027. His helmet\u0027s blue visor was down, blanking his face. Being a woman, mouthy, Irish, a leftie and a blood-drinker, she\u0027d had her differences with the police. Even before the Terror, peelers shoved her about. Kate had been arrested as a suffragette and insurgent, as a rebel and rabble-rouser. She\u0027d marched to Aldermaston and against Vietnam. She\u0027d been force-fed, hosed down, truncheoned and garlic-sprayed. She\u0027d been interned without trial, locked up for her own protection and bound over to keep the peace. Helmet-head wasn\u0027t a riot cop. The visor meant something else. He wore B Division sleeve flashes. He was a vampire. \u0027Let her through, Herrick,\u0027 said a plainclothes officer. \u0027You know who she is.\u0027 The pig stepped aside like a robo-man. Without seeing Herrick\u0027s face, she could picture his expression. Lips a straight line. Eyes red flints. No love lost. Press credentials wouldn\u0027t get her into Maryon Park this morning if she were only on a crime beat. The early morning call made that clear. She was invited in her capacity as Associate Member of the Diogenes Club. Her shadowy capacity. Funny how you could be an enemy of the state and a secret civil servant at the same time. She knew the OiC, Detective Superintendent Bellaver. He had a doleful, surprisingly groovy moustache. Most officers under him were vampires, but the Yard liked a living super at B Division. Old coppers\u0027 tales about the undead being not \u0027creative\u0027 enough for high-level police work were still trotted out. Your basic biter made a decent enough plod, all right. Nothing puts the wind up a scrote like a fang-flash and a speed-burst. But when it comes to a whodunit, you want a live mind on the job. The thinking was shite, but Kate was happy to leave that argument to vampire cops. Bloodsuckers in blue did her few favours. If anything, nosferatu filth tended to be bigger bastards than warm police just to prove they weren\u0027t soft on their own kind. Detective Sergeant Griffin, a vampire, handed Bellaver a polystyrene cup of tea. The swirly violet pattern of Griffin\u0027s trendy Nehru jacket hurt her eyes. Bellaver took a swig of brown liquid and made a face as if a tramp had pissed in it. He looked like that most of the time, and no wonder. B Division was Scotland Yard\u0027s unit for crimes involving \u0027the vampire community\u0027. Kate thought being called a \u0027community\u0027 was one step from mandatory bat symbol armbands. After that came internment camps, then scythes and stakes. Anticipating a Soviet crackdown on the limited reforms of Transylvania\u0027s Premier Torgu, Central European undead had been arriving in Britain since spring. Six weeks ago, the Tory MP Enoch Powell delivered an alarmist speech about Carpathian immigrants. He invoked \u0027rivers of blood\u0027 and not in any metaphorical sense. Lord Ruthven threw him out of the Shadow Cabinet, which only made him more popular with an aggrieved, resentful section of the warm population. Powell\u0027s followers were as keen on marching as any radical student and more prone to bursts of the old ultra-violence. Enoch was too patrician and parliamentarian to endorse street-fighting. Others were happy to carry flaming torches. Extremists like Lorrimer Van Helsing - supposedly descended from Dracula\u0027s arch-enemy, though Kate knew Abraham Van Helsing and couldn\u0027t remember him having children - came close to advocating extermination. The boot-boys had a craze for what they charmingly called \u0027Drakky Bashing\u0027. Early morning assaults on lone vampires by gangs of short-haired thugs seldom prompted thorough police investigations. \u0027Enock is Rite\u0027 was scratched on her front door, above a crude cartoon of a bat with a stake through it. The building\u0027s other tenants were also vampires: Morgan Delt, an artist semi-permanently shifted into long-armed apeshape \u0027to make a statement\u0027, and a quiet Japanese girl whose nameplate was a kanji which meant \u0027Mouse\u0027. Delt had Kate sign a petition against some Van Helsing rally and asked her out to a counter-demo, but she\u0027d had enough of police horses. Even she thought it best to keep her head down rather than risk deportation. In Eire, vampires had by law to be referred to as Dearg-Dul to keep the Ghaeilge word in use. Silver-toting priests strode about Dublin in a righteous fury which made Enoch seem vamp-symp. \u0027Hello Katie,\u0027 said Bellaver. \u0027Sorry to keep you up after bed-time.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s it all about, Alfie?\u0027 \u0027Nasty business. Potentially political. We\u0027ve already seen off Peculiar Crimes. Bryant and May want to bolt it onto their Leicester Square case. It\u0027s no surprise your lot want it too. The Diogenes Bloody Club.\u0027 \u0027My lot aren\u0027t exactly mine.\u0027 As ever, the situation between her and the British Secret State was delicate. \u0027I heard something about that. They\u0027ll never cut you loose.\u0027 \u0027They might not be them any more. Not in any sense I recognise. It\u0027s the Diogenes Happening now. Next it\u0027ll be the Diogenes Experience. Mycroft Holmes would not have approved.\u0027 She\u0027d eventually have to go to Pall Mall and report to Richard Jeperson, Chair of the Ruling Cabal. He got a lie-in and the Sunday supplements in his big circular bed. She risked spontaneous combustion. It was ever thus. \u0027Why was this place called Hanging Woods?\u0027 Bellaver asked, out of the blue. \u0027Why d\u0027you think?\u0027 she responded. \u0027They hanged people here.\u0027 \u0027In a minute, you\u0027ll be sorry they stopped.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve never been in favour of capital punishment.\u0027 \u0027Good for you, Katie,\u0027 said Bellaver. \u0027Twenty years on the job and I\u0027m in favour of capital punishment in schools.\u0027 The Super led her towards the trees. More uniformed police stood about, all vampires, one a woman. WPC Rogers\u0027 regulation hat came with a practical black veil. She darted birdlike looks about the park, quickened senses attracted to tiny sounds, scents and sights. It was overwhelming at first. Donna Rogers had the beginnings of a focus which would be handy in police work and offputting in her personal life. She could spot a new pin in a lawn and a peroxide hair on a lapel. Geoff Brent, the warm police surgeon, was grave and useless. He wore a 1961 cream mac to spite the fabber world of this end of the decade. A sheet lay over someone on the ground. They weren\u0027t taking a nap. \u0027What makes this one of yours?\u0027 she asked Bellaver. \u0027It\u0027s a vampire murder, ducks.\u0027 Flashbacks. Whitechapel, 1888. Jack the Ripper. France, 1918. The Bloody Red Baron. Rome, 1959. The Crimson Executioner. If there was a string of vampire murders, she tended to trip over it. She had to admit it looked suspicious. \u0027Not that kind of vampire murder,\u0027 Bellaver said, knowing what she was thinking. \u0027The other kind. Meet Carol Thatcher...\u0027 He nodded. Griffin lifted the sheet. A young woman. Formerly warm, now dead. Blonde, open-eyed. Make-up caked. Orange-and-pink Mary Quant dress torn off the shoulder, purple-and-taupe Balenciaga tights shredded, one white Courreges go-go boot missing. On her neck, two ragged punctures. The classic \u0027Seal of Dracula\u0027. Kate looked at Bellaver. \u0027How long since... ?\u0027 \u0027I knew you\u0027d ask, so I checked out Edgar Lustgarten\u0027s Big Book of British Murderers. In London, this is the first one of these since the Blitz. 1944. The Blackout Bloodsucker. John George Haigh. Remember him? Disposed of the drained delicti with sulphuric acid. Guillotined 1949. Peculiar Crimes\u0027 Leicester Square case is a meat-skewer stabbing made to look like a vampire murder. Otherwise, there are rumours. But we scotch rumours. B Division is particular about closing those cases.\u0027 Kate knelt by the dead girl, Carol. \u0027Vampires kill, all right,\u0027 said the Super. \u0027We don\u0027t need Edgar Bloodlustgarten to tell us that. Vampires kill like every other sod. You know the songs. \"Couldn\u0027t stand the wife\u0027s nagging any longer so I shut her up.\" \"He called my pint a poof so I went for him.\" On top of that, vampires get carried away and suck some poor popsy dry. A very specific type of manslaughter, Katie. I\u0027ve seen too many bloated, befuddled mugs when sun comes up and the girlfriend\u0027s cold.\u0027 She hadn\u0027t been there herself, but dreaded the possibility. The warm didn\u0027t understand what a mouthful - even a taste - of blood was to a vampire. Some vamps had contingency plans for how to get rid of the body, cope with the guilt and carry on. Kate cared more about not being a monster than about getting away with it when the red thirst became the red mania. Too many otherwise decent vampires lost self-control while battening on innocents. She wasn\u0027t immune. She was only a hundred and five, seventy-nine years a vampire. Her elder friend Genevieve confided that over the centuries she\u0027d killed three people without meaning to. \u0027There are vampire villains out there too,\u0027 Bellaver went on, warming to the subject. \u0027Proper impalers like Waldo Zhernikov, smug leeches like Big Bloodsucker Hog and motorcycle maniacs like the Living Dead. They certainly kill people. And use teeth and claws to do it. But they kill because they want to or to prove a point, not because they need the blood. Blood\u0027s everywhere, Katie. You can buy it in a Wimpy Bar. Since they\u0027re at each other\u0027s throats all the time, vampire villains mostly kill other vampire villains. They\u0027d do their own mum if she got between them and a payroll blag. Tears are not shed in B Division, truth be told, when the likes of Jack \"the Bat\" McVitie fetch up with tent-pegs through their ribs.\u0027 Griffin gathered up the sheet and made a mess of it. WPC Rogers took it away and folded it properly into a square. Kate had an impulse to touch the dead girl\u0027s wounds. \u0027This is what vampires used to do,\u0027 she said. \u0027B.D. Before Dracula.\u0027 \u0027On the nose, Katie. It\u0027s new and old at the same time. What you mob were like when folk scarcely believed you existed. Drag a bird off the street, bite her neck, suck her like an orange, chuck the peel in the bushes.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027ll do it again,\u0027 she said. \u0027Or she,\u0027 said the WPC. \u0027Good point, Rogers,\u0027 admitted Bellaver. \u0027Female of the species and all. But, returning to the nub - yes, he or she will most likely re-offend. Kill again. Haigh did six before Inspector Hornleigh nabbed him.\u0027 Kate was sick to her stomach, disgusted with the way her fangs sharpened and the need pricked in the back of her throat. She knew this would be bad. There were implications. \u0027So here we are again,\u0027 Bellaver said. \u0027In the vampire-hunting business, God help us. Any tips?\u0027 \u0027Take early retirement?\u0027 \u0027No such luck.\u0027 \u0027Then, get a shit-proof sou\u0027wester. When Carol gets her picture in the papers, it\u0027s going to start pouring.\u0027 From his face, Kate saw Bellaver had already worked that out.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-38.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) Rome. 1959.
