{"id":93178,"no":53,"title":"Page 53","content":"\u0027I was surprised when you called,\u0027 Kate told Eric DeBoys. \u0027I didn\u0027t think a new-made blood like you would be interested in an old stick like me.\u0027 DeBoys grinned, showing off his chin dimple as well as his teeth. \u0027I\u0027m at St Bartolph\u0027s to learn from my elders.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not a teacher. And I\u0027m not an elder.\u0027 \u0027No, but you\u0027re an example.\u0027 The School of Vampirism had its own dusk till dawn student bar, The Deconsecrated Chapel. Pampered vermin nestled in straw-filled cages hung from the vaulted ceiling. Mice, rats, piglets. Movie posters hung in alcoves, replacing sacred images. Someone had magic-markered red eyes and fangs onto Rudolf Valentino in The Count, W.C. Fields in Never Give a Sucker an Even Break and Orlon Kronsteen in London Screams and lipstick-kissed heart-shaped wounds on the necks o f J ean Harlow in Red Dust, Jane Fonda in Cat Garou and Mavis Weld in Clara Croft. She\u0027d seen that before, at Thomas Nolan\u0027s studio - the work of the same alteration artist, or just a trend she\u0027d not noticed till now? Just in case this date was more than social or - perish the thought! - romantic, she had let Nezumi come along and sit in the corner. Not that Kate could have stopped her bodyguard. The underage elder drank sugared blood through a straw. The high glucose content was added artificially, not because the donors were diabetic. She shooed away a couple of warm boys who tried to chat her up. Most of DeBoys\u0027 fellow Black Monks were in the bar. Armstrong and Anna were having a quiet argument while Keith and Withnail posed in the dark at the edge of the dance-floor. Dru, the vampire girl she\u0027d seen with a warm crowd a few days ago, was here, alone. She sported a black eye and a simmering, angry attitude. Grabbing one of Nezumi\u0027s cast-offs, she nuzzled his neck with alarming attack. Things were changing on campus, as folk found out who their real friends - or real enemies - were. In the pulpit, Mo?se King played records. The Zombies\u0027 \u0027Time of the Season\u0027, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\u0027s \u0027Blood\u0027, Question Mark and the Mysterians\u0027 \u002796 Tears\u0027. Cathy and Pony go-goed in perfect sync on a chessboard floor with lit-up white squares. Scruffy guys watched the twins, fascinated. No sign of James Eastman. She supposed this wasn\u0027t his scene. King spun The Royal Guardsmen\u0027s \u0027Snoopy vs the Red Baron\u0027 - not a favourite pop pick of Kate\u0027s. Responding to the song, Nezumi finished her drink and started dancing with the French girls. They responded aggressively, like basketball players marking a star shooter. Noticing Nezumi, King gave her a Japanese theme, playing Biff Bailey and His Jazzmen\u0027s \u0027Sukiyaki\u0027. She sang to the instrumental, in a clear soprano. \u0027Ue o muite aruk��.\u0027 \u0027I hold my head up high.\u0027 If King had known Nezumi\u0027s tastes, he\u0027d have dug out \u0027Three Wheels on My Wagon\u0027 or \u0027Nellie the Elephant\u0027. Kate and DeBoys drank Gold Top. The Boy Eric wasn\u0027t on a student grant budget. She guessed he was from money. Everything about him was expensive. He had a Norman name. DeBoys. DeBois. Of the woods. That made sense: he had a big bad wolfish aspect, like someone who rode to hounds but longed for game more dangerous than the fox. She hadn\u0027t drunk Gold Top in a while. She tried not to think who it had come from. This was good stuff. If she stood, she\u0027d be a little giddy. \u0027What do you want to be when you grow up?\u0027 Kate asked. \u0027Do we grow up?\u0027 \u0027I wonder sometimes,\u0027 she admitted. \u0027My degree is in Law... but I might go into politics.\u0027 \u0027Which party?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the problem. None of them appeal.\u0027 \u0027Traditionally, thanks to Lord Ruthven, the Tories are the Vampire Party. Enoch Powell has probably undone that. A well-spoken lad like you\u0027d be welcome on the editorial board of the Socialist Vampire.\u0027 \u0027A bunch of Scrawdykes,\u0027 DeBoys sneered. \u0027So many Points of Order, never a Point of Action.\u0027 \u0027Do you want Action?\u0027 His eyes gleamed. \u0027Indeed I do. Elders go still, you know...\u0027 As I said, I\u0027m not...\u0027 \u0027I never said you were... I mean Professor Croft. He\u0027s like a lizard. He never moves. He hasn\u0027t moved. He\u0027s found his crack - his coffin - and he\u0027s comfortable in it.\u0027 So, Croft\u0027s disciple might have outgrown his master? Or wanted her to believe that. \u0027Don\u0027t underestimate him,\u0027 she said. \u0027I don\u0027t. He\u0027s survived centuries. But he\u0027s stuck. When I turned, things sped up. It\u0027s the same for the rest of us.\u0027 \u0027The Black Monks?\u0027 \u0027You could call us that.\u0027 This evening, he wasn\u0027t wearing robes, but a black velvet Carnabetian suit. His cream ruffle shirt was unbuttoned. Medallions - inverted crosses, a boar\u0027s head, a Blue Peter badge, a ruby-eyed Aztec skull - clustered on his hairy chest. It was a good thing she\u0027d dolled up. Kate wore a Jean Varon outfit, a purple minidress with a mesh midriff and matching lace-up boots. Not something she\u0027d buy for herself, she\u0027d demanded the gear as a gift from Richard Jeperson. The Diogenes Club were obliged to pacify her after a simple job went south on a cross-channel ferry. \u0027We move fast, Kate. Think fast. We should call ourselves the Quick.\u0027 \u0027Do you have a motorbike?\u0027 DeBoys laughed. \u0027Like Jimmy the Yank? No, Lord no. I drive a Jag.\u0027 \u0027I drive a Mini.\u0027 \u0027But you\u0027re Quick. I can see it.\u0027 \u0027Maybe I used to be. Then I. well, I did grow up. I was always the Sensible One. They called me that when I was alive, as a polite kind of insult. \"Sensible\" meant \"unmarriageable\".\u0027 Why was she telling this lupine toff her life story? Was she fascinated? Or was it the Gold Top? Her brain was fizzing. \u0027Where are \"they\" now?\u0027 \u0027My friend Penelope - who is mostly who I mean when I say \"they\" - is still knocking about. Though she didn\u0027t get married, as it happens. Bit of a failure, there. Goes to show you shouldn\u0027t gloat too much.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve a cutting edge, Miss Reed.\u0027 \u0027I shouldn\u0027t be mean about Penny. She\u0027s not had an easy time of it. Nothing turned out the way she expected, either.\u0027 The man who hadn\u0027t married Penny hadn\u0027t married her, either. Or Genevieve, even. He was gone now. Sometimes, when the wind blew a certain way, she saw the faintest trace of Charles Beauregard in Richard Jeperson, who now sat in Charles\u0027s chair on the Ruling Cabal. More often, sadly, Richard reminded her of Edwin Winthrop, another Most Valued Member of the Diogenes Club. She didn\u0027t much care to be reminded of Edwin, still alive with some of her blood in him, sustaining his sharpness. Eric DeBoys had an Edwinian streak: a glint of wanting something and being willing to rip it out of you with a smile and some flowers. A walk in the woods with DeBoys would end up with rough and tumble in the chase. She wondered if she should put him up for club membership - give the Lovelies someone to squabble over. A fuss broke out at the other side of the bar. Simon Armstrong, red-faced, shouted something which didn\u0027t carry over \u0027The Legend of Xanadu\u0027. Anna Franklyn crossed her arms and stood back from him. Armstrong flinched at the whip-cracks in the song and made a show of storming out in a huff, snarling at the warm lads in an attempt to put a vampire face on things. He completed his exit, then needed to come back for his duffel coat - ruining the dramatic effect. Armstrong slunk off for good this time and the warm lads jeered. \u0027Uh oh,\u0027 said Kate, \u0027Anna\u0027s in the wind.\u0027 The snake-woman walked across the dance-floor. Her tiny, sari-inhibited steps showed off her hips. Her head cobra-wobbled. Cathy and Pony stood aside as she glided past. They were still in a dance duel with Nezumi, who matched them step for step. Kate realised much of the stomping on her ceiling was Nezumi practising the frug, the monkey, the batusi and yosaki naruko. Without invitation, Anna sat at their table. A lit candle was stuck in an empty, wax-encrusted wine bottle. Her face was olive-green in the flickering light. She blinked sideways. \u0027Simon\u0027s in a tizzy,\u0027 she said. \u0027Simon\u0027s always in a tizzy,\u0027 said DeBoys. \u0027He\u0027s a wet and a weed.\u0027 \u0027\u0027Tis true,\u0027 Anna sighed. \u0027Marshes and mires are not wetter and weedier than he.\u0027 Anna ignored Kate and started fiddling with DeBoys\u0027s sleeve, stroking the velvet nap like cat\u0027s fur, then rubbing it the wrong way, then smoothing it again. DeBoys smiled at Kate, unashamed. Anna started stroking his arm with her cheek. Now, she was looking at Kate too, with unreadable serpent eyes. Kate wondered if she should find a reason to leave, but didn\u0027t think DeBoys wanted her to go. Far from it. He was hatching ideas, enjoying himself. He was even close to opening up, she thought. If he could tell her anything, then he\u0027d cough it up when he felt he was in power. That might be what Eric DeBoys most wanted - from the Law, from politics, from life - power over others. And control. So: sexy fascist vampire dandy. This was Machiavelli\u0027s Prince \u002768-style. \u0027This scene is a drag tonight, Eric,\u0027 said Anna. \u0027Let\u0027s go out.\u0027 \u0027Ladies?\u0027 asked DeBoys. \u0027Sure,\u0027 said Kate. \u0027I\u0027m game.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll just bet you are,\u0027 he said. The crack wasn\u0027t worthy of him. A chink in the armour of cool. They stood. Anna pulled a saffron shawl over her sari. DeBoys settled a scarlet-lined opera cloak over his shoulders, fastening it with interlocking snake-heads. A platinum clasp; not silver, of course. Kate\u0027s ensemble came with a midi-cape, but she never wore it. A cloak screamed \u0027I am a vampire\u0027, playing up to stereotype. Obviously, DeBoys disagreed - or, rather, was comfortable with stereotype. Kate kept asking herself who this young blade was really, but wondered if the surface - the grin and the chin and the cape and the elaborate hair and the quickness - was just what there was of him. Glancing backwards as she was guided out of the Chapel, Kate saw Nezumi make a move to leave the dance-floor and follow. Her path was barred by Cathy and Pony, who adopted hostile dance stances. Nezumi held her hockey stick like a samurai sword. The rest of the patrons got off the chessboard. \u0027Looks like we picked the right time to seek new meat,\u0027 said DeBoys, arm firmly around Kate\u0027s shoulders. \u0027Could be entertaining,\u0027 Kate ventured. \u0027You\u0027ve seen one cat-fight...\u0027 He nodded at the French twins, who demonstrated their swiftness. Nezumi blocked their first blows with her stick and leg. Kate would have taken bets on her bodyguard, though she realised this fight was about keeping the elder busy, not putting her down. Cathy and Pony were mercenaries. Was DeBoys paying them over what they got from Croft? Or did the Professor have them guard his disciples when they weren\u0027t protecting him? King put on the Amen Corner\u0027s \u0027Scream and Scream Again\u0027 and packed all his other precious records in a sturdy cardboard box. Yes, things were going to get broken. If \u0027Hey, Ninety-Eight Point Six\u0027 was the anthem of the militant warm, then \u0027Scream and Scream Again\u0027 was the violent vampire signature tune. It was loud enough to cover the racket of a scrap. Nezumi whacked Pony about the head and dodged a savate kick from Cathy. Kate was gently but firmly steered out of the bar. Keith Kenneth was with them, now. He ditched Withnail and fell in behind DeBoys. Beyond Keith, Kate saw Nezumi put Cathy on the floor by sweeping her feet out from under her but take a scratch to the cheek from Pony. Then, she was out of the Deconsecrated Chapel. The din continued, muted by the old building\u0027s thick walls. The Amen Corner thumped along. After midnight, the campus was otherwise peaceful - though, thanks to the School of Vampirism, far from deserted. PC Regent had finally gone home, but tape was still up around the burned grass. \u0027If Van Helsing\u0027s comic cuts come back, we\u0027re ready for them,\u0027 said DeBoys. \u0027Louts and oiks and rabble.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re not my favourite people, either,\u0027 she said. \u0027The vampire who was killed...\u0027 \u0027Griffin.\u0027 \u0027...you knew him?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d met him,\u0027 she said, hoping the dark would hide her blush of shame. She didn\u0027t want to deny Griffin, but wanted to keep her police connections quiet-ish. As if they weren\u0027t general knowledge. If the Black Monks had marked Nezumi, they must know about her official capacity. \u0027We\u0027ve always expected attacks,\u0027 said DeBoys. \u0027Eventually,\u0027 said Keith. \u0027You responded quickly,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m grateful.\u0027 Expected? Or known about in advance? \u0027It\u0027s in the open, now,\u0027 said DeBoys. \u0027That\u0027s better. In a stand-up fight, we\u0027ll win. And everyone will see us win.\u0027 They were walking across the campus. Kate didn\u0027t know where to. \u0027If it comes to an all-out fight, we\u0027ll lose,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027Trust me. We will all lose. I\u0027ve seen it too many times.\u0027 DeBoys turned to her, smiling. His cloak whirled with him. \u0027Maybe you\u0027re an elder after all, Miss Reed.\u0027 \u0027I just don\u0027t think you should be so eager for a scrap,\u0027 she said. She knew she sounded weak. Anna was attached to DeBoys now, slipped under his cloak, lacquered nails tapping his medallions. \u0027We\u0027re thinking a great deal bigger than a scrap, my darling,\u0027 DeBoys said. \u0027Black Monks all, and hellfire to quaff,\u0027 said Keith. DeBoys, Anna and Keith snapped their fingers. At her. Anna separated from DeBoys. Keith moved away. They had her surrounded. They were in a quadrangle between the biology lab and the School of Vampirism. In the centre of the grass was a Marcel DeLange bust of Elwyn Clayton on the scale of an Easter Island head. An alarming thing. Its eyes spiralled like pinwheels. Its jowls dribbled. Kate knew her nails were growing. She felt threatened. Or flirted with. Or both. The three students walked around her, taking mockingly slow steps followed by vampire-swift flits. She turned, trying to keep her eyes on DeBoys, who led this game of ring-a-rosy. As they moved, their faces shifted. Anna\u0027s was scalier, forked tongue darting from a lipless mouth. Keith\u0027s was harder, rougher, stiff and distorted by big, chunky fangs. DeBoys\u0027 was a leonine mask, sculpted hair now flowing from his cheeks and neck, magnificent yet pantomimish. She knew something they didn\u0027t. Something about herself. She was quicker than them. If she concentrated, they seemed to slow even when they thought they were at their fastest. If she chose, she could step out of their circle easy. She could scale the walls of the Unlimited Dream Factory. She could be gone into shadows their eyes couldn\u0027t penetrate. Why did she feel so confident? Had DeBoys put something in her drink? She shouldn\u0027t have fallen for that. She stopped turning and stood still, serene. They weren\u0027t ringing her in. They were dancing tribute. Lord, she was becoming an elder! She clapped her hands, once, loud as a rifle-shot. And the dancers stopped. It took seconds for DeBoys\u0027cloak to settle, but he was rigid in an instant. He was in front of her, eyes fixed on hers. \u0027Very nice,\u0027 she said. \u0027Is this an initiation?\u0027 DeBoys laughed, charmingly. He might even be a little self-conscious about the game. Anna and Keith were too serious. \u0027Or is this foreplay?\u0027 \u0027Or a play for four?\u0027 said Keith, touching her face. That made her skin creep. Keith was DeBoys with all the pleasing qualities scraped away. DeBoys would use flowers before force, and apply the spurs lightly; Keith would bend her over a dustbin and rut like a stag. She jammed the flat of her hand against Keith\u0027s chest. He was lifted off his feet and barrelled backwards across the quad. Anna was there to catch him, but he was furious and shocked. \u0027Didn\u0027t expect that, did you?\u0027 she said. She had an urge to punch him until his face was a mess. She knew she could do it. Her teeth were extended. Her mouth was a little miracle. Fangs like razors sliding from gumsheaths like velvet. She never bit her tongue. \u0027Come upstairs, Kate,\u0027 said DeBoys. \u0027We\u0027ve a present for you.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-53.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) Rome. 1959.
