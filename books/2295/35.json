{"id":93160,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"LYING IN STATE Bells tolled and crows circled in the night. The funeral party clung to the cliffs of Fregene, negotiating a narrow path that led from the Palazzo Otranto down to the beach. The coffin went first, carried by the faithful Klove and the top-hatted, long-nailed Ze do Caix?o, undertaker to the wealthy and notorious. Genevieve fell in with the procession. Kate and Penelope were a little in front. This would be her last appearance in Italy, she decided. The warning issued at the Colosseum had taken and she would quit Rome, never to return. She still didn\u0027t entirely understand the personage who\u0027d nearly killed but finally spared her. Her throat wasn\u0027t quite healed and she spoke with a froggy rasp. Attendants held flaming torches to light the path. If it hadn\u0027t been for the Crimson Executioner, all vampire society would have been here. As far as the world knew, he was still active, set on exterminating any elders who trespassed in his city. An actor named Travis Anderson, who had mysteriously disappeared a few years ago, had been found dead in the Colosseum but no official connection was made with the Executioner. On the beach was a bier of driftwood. The coffin was laid on it and Klove lifted off the lid. Genevieve looked at the corpse. It was indeed Dracula, head resting on a pillow placed above his body. He still resisted corruption. Princess Asa wailed her grief. Penelope comforted the elder. They would wait till dawn, then fire the bier. Cremation had the advantage of demonstrating that Dracula was indeed definitively dead. The vigil shouldn\u0027t last more than two hours. Genevieve looked at the faces of the few mourners. Most were members of the soon-to-be-dispersed household. Kate\u0027s Italian reporter was here; she was pointedly not speaking with him. \u0027It must have been Commander Bond\u0027s hand,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027Guided by the Mother of Tears. He killed Dracula.\u0027 Kate nodded. \u0027I don\u0027t care, as long as it wasn\u0027t me.\u0027 Bond had survived the night of the games, but Genevieve thought he\u0027d never be the same man again. He was on his way back to the Diogenes Club. The Princess knelt at the foot of the bier and shrieked at the dying night. She was quite unhinged. \u0027Princess Asa is an elder,\u0027 Kate said. Genevieve didn\u0027t follow. \u0027The Mother of Tears said only one elder remained in Rome,\u0027 Kate continued. \u0027You, Gene. Why didn\u0027t the Princess count?\u0027 Genevieve looked out at the sea. \u0027Fregene is outside the city proper,\u0027 she said. \u0027Beyond the Realm of Tears?\u0027 \u0027In that case, why kill Dracula? He never left the palazzo, never went into the city.\u0027 Genevieve had no answer. \u0027She was here, though. I saw her.\u0027 Kate was thinking something through. She was like Charles, sparking swiftly from one thing to another, piling up evidence, filling in gaps with deductions. Suddenly, she climbed up on the bier, exciting another wail from Asa, and pulled Dracula\u0027s right hand out of the coffin. She showed Genevieve the thickly-haired palm. A weal was scorched across it. \u0027Remember the silver scalpel with vampire skin burned on it?\u0027 said Kate. \u0027The proof that a vampire struck the killing blow with a bare hand? What happened was that Dracula was stabbed and took hold of the knife-handle himself, trying to pull it out. He couldn\u0027t keep the grip and let go, his hand falling by his side. Nobody looked at his hairy palms.\u0027 \u0027Kate, what do you think you\u0027re doing?\u0027 Penelope demanded. Kate hopped down onto the sand. \u0027I\u0027m catching you out, Penelope.\u0027 Genevieve saw at once that Kate had guessed right. Kate took Penelope\u0027s hand. \u0027You wore gloves, Penny,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027re careful.\u0027 Penelope did not deny the accusation. \u0027You arrange things,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027Receptions, parties, funerals. Other people\u0027s lives. And you arranged a murder, just as you do everything, with a touch of style, but without wanting to take too much credit.\u0027 Genevieve stood by Kate. If Penelope attacked her friend, she was ready - no matter what she owed the Englishwoman - to save her. Long moments passed. \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Penelope, coolly. \u0027I\u0027ll tell you what happened. I can\u0027t claim to explain anything, but...\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-35.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) Rome. 1959.
