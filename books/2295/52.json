{"id":93177,"no":52,"title":"Page 52","content":"While Kate was dead to the world, a lot happened. None of it good. Graffiti appeared all over the city. \u00273-1\u0027. Or, spelling it out, \u0027Vampires 3, Humans 1\u0027. So far as anyone could gather, unconnected people were responsible... Warm supporters of the Circle of Light, crying vengeance after their failed attempt to equalise... and a certain aggrieved, gloating, nasty-minded species of vampire crowing over a petty lead. The score wasn\u0027t likely to stay level long. Soon, it wouldn\u0027t be a football result. It\u0027d be a rugby result. Then, it would be impossible to keep count. Again. With so many long-lived folk walking around, Kate thought they\u0027d have learned something. Evidently not. Van Helsing\u0027s group weren\u0027t the only defenders of humanity on the streets. Donna Rogers wasn\u0027t the only vampire ready to meet fist with fang. Enoch Powell was everywhere, making speeches and giving interviews. He called for calm in a manner calculated to inflame the extremists he loftily disavowed. Marcus Obadiah, a defrocked priest, said outright what Powell hinted at, declaring Holy War against the unclean monsters who lurked among pure humans and should be exorcised with fire, silver and the stake. Someone had cheekily vandalised the Sir Francis Varney Memorial in St James\u0027 Park, chiselling a hole in the chest of the statue of the former Viceroy of India - a reference to the Second Mutiny, when the unlikeable Varney was strapped over the barrel of a gun and had a cannonball fired through him. Two eccentrics, Sean Manchester and David Farrant, were picked up by the Kingstead Night Watch while trying to break into Lucy Westenra\u0027s long-since-vacated family tomb. They claimed they only wanted to make sure the girl remained truly dead. Having fallen out with each other, Manchester and Farrant were conducting an entertaining feud in the letter columns of the local paper. Poor Lucy - if she\u0027d been let lie, the world might be a better place. A Unigate delivery tanker was hijacked by men in Beatles wigs and Sgt Pepper tunics and five hundred gallons of blood poured into the sewers. That would congeal into a vile lagoon. Old rumours circulated about the things which lived under the city. The blood was said to be the staple diet of the Black Swine of Hampstead, the India-Rubber Men and the Ghost of Guy Fawkes. Prominent vampires, including Lord Ruthven, Baron Meinster and - would you credit it? - Paul Durward, were called on to condemn Donna Rogers and all weaselled out of saying much. The vampire murderer might be sulking that his quiet killings were driven off the front pages by public bloodletting. In his absence, Rogers became the Bloodthirsty Monster of 1968. The papers ran photos Bellaver issued of the warm WPC, graduating from Hendon with a smile, but darkened and retouched to make her a cross between Myra Hindley, Cruella de Vil and Graf von Orlok. Kate had imagined right-wing commentators would be torn between labelling Craven a cop-killing tearaway who deserved what he got and a heroic vampire-slayer saving womankind from monstrous affronts. The fact that Craven\u0027s victim was a policeman carrying out his duty to protect the public was so seldom mentioned she suspected newspaper proprietors had issued a dictat that this was to be suppressed. The story was out in distorted forms, skewed for the prejudices of whoever was retelling it. The Manfred Commission convened early, and was taking depositions from whoever it could haul in, starting - of course - with Enoch Bloody Powell. The real action would be on the streets rather than in Whitehall committee rooms. Private Eye was already running clever-clever jokes about the \u0027Sangfroid Commission\u0027, whose chairman found excuses to hold meetings in Soho basements to examine testimony from exotic dancers. Kate had heard rumours that James Manfred was a private connoisseur of kink. Jessica\u0027s granddad was stuck in jail but protesters were calling for the \u0027heroes of humanity\u0027 to be freed. If the Circle of Light had killed Kate instead of Griffin, they\u0027d be out on bail. Despite the papers, the Metropolitan Police couldn\u0027t let people who murdered their officers get away with a rap on the knuckles and a \u0027don\u0027t do it again, son\u0027. Peter Craven, a minor, couldn\u0027t be named by the press in connection with the murder he\u0027d committed, but could in connection with his own death - prompting a high degree of squirming circumlocution which served to confuse the man on the Clapham Omnibus. A delegation from the Socialist Vampire showed up in Holborn to protest the arrest of Donna Rogers, though it must choke them to take a stand on behalf of a pig lady who was also a nosferatu sister. The presence of rival protestors suggested imminent street-fights which would make the Blood Riots look tame. Jessica Van Helsing, Kate\u0027s new best friend, said she\u0027d persuade her Paul to stage a rally for peace between the warm and the undead. She thought he could get John Lennon and John Blaylock to appear and headline a free concert in Hyde Park. Kate had to admit Jess and Paul made a pretty poster couple for human-vampire love, but reckoned peace had already had its chance. Everyone was picking sides for war. Also, she didn\u0027t need to hear Blaylock sing \u0027The Laughing Gnome\u0027 ever again. The worst news was that Bellaver was out. Someone had to take the fall for letting Rogers get at Craven. He was the obvious candidate. Over half his personnel - pretty much the only vampire detectives in the Met - were suspended or reassigned. Norman Pilcher, of all people, was temporarily running B Division. He knew how to make a BOP bust but not how to run a murder investigation, so there was no progress on the Carol Thatcher/Laura Bellows killings. Among the coppers in the frame as replacements for Bellaver were Charlie Barlow of the New Town Task Force and James Anderton of the Cheshire Constabulary, warm men known for sweeping implementation of brutal policies. From now on crimes involving vampires would not be investigated by vampires. It was a short step towards the Met deploying Vampire Slayer units more efficient than a crowd of crossbow-waving yobs in Beano masks. Assaults by the warm against vampires skyrocketed in the daylight hours and well into the evening. With the Circle of Light busted, a group calling itself The 98.6 - after that song - was active. They were careful about being caught, inducing bouts of amnesia in witnesses which Marcus Monserrat couldn\u0027t cure. The Unigate blood tanker stunt was one of theirs. There would be an equal or disproportionate response from the vampire community. New-borns who\u0027d been painted with CND signs and searching for mystic inner peace last month formed little circles around Carpathian Guard left-behinds whose expertise in guerilla resistance was a prized commodity. The Living Dead, the vampire motorcycle gang, patrolled suburban streets, claiming they\u0027d protect any viper hassled by The 98.6. The shady entrepreneur Hogarth - Big Bloodsucker Hog - put extra undead bouncers on his nightclubs. Imposing bodies stood on every corner of the West End Jungle. According to Nezumi, the Diogenes Club were caught up in high-level politics. Richard Jeperson had to get out of bed, while the Lovelies took to the corridors of power in order to dissuade pin-striped dolts from courses of idiocy. Even their powers of fascination were strained. Doubtless chuckling at his luck, Harold Wilson was presently on holiday in the Scilly Isles, waving his pipe at reporters and posing in a Ganex mac which didn\u0027t suit the climate. That put the hardly inspiring Home Secretary Jim Callaghan in the hot seat as acting Head of Government. All police leave was cancelled. The Home Office ordered teargas and garlic spray in bulk. These preparatory measures were leaked to the press. Lord Ruthven, scenting blood in the water, made noises about a snap election. He came back early from his holiday in Scotland to make the Prime Minister look bad. Carol and Laura were still dead. Whoever was responsible was still at large. As of now, only Kate Reed seemed interested in bringing them to book.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-52.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) Rome. 1959.
