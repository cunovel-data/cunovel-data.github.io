{"id":93167,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"Access to the darkroom, a former stable, was via an airlock set-up. Two black blankets pegged on clotheslines. When Kate came out with the wet contact sheets, Bellaver\u0027s pet hypnotist was shining lights into Thomas Nolan\u0027s unseeing eyes. Marcus Monserrat was a venerable, bowed gent with leg-braces and crutches, deeply suntanned or part-Asian, sporting a neatly trimmed white beard. A brain specialist, he\u0027d returned from a sojourn in Tibet with a supposed mastery of ancient mesmeric techniques. She remembered the \u002720s and \u002730s craze for going to Tibet and acquiring the power to cloud men\u0027s minds. The Disappearing Diplomat, James Hilton\u0027s biography of Hugh Conway, inspired a lost generation of fatheads to freeze their extremities off trudging up snowy Himalayas in search of Shangri-La, Shambhala or K\u0027un-L\u0027un. Kent Allard, a flier she\u0027d known during the First World War, was one of the few who came back. With Tibet occupied by Red China, would-be mystics favoured the Maharishis of India. She understood serious dark postulants had moved on to a new continent. They hung about Ayers Rock soliciting Aboriginal shamen for the secret of killing via shouting or bone-pointing, as if there were a crying need for cleverer ways of murdering people. For Monserrat, supernatural powers hadn\u0027t meant material wealth. He didn\u0027t seem to have set out to be an ascetic. Once a prosperous Harley Street neurologist, he now had cards up in newsagents\u0027 in Marylebone High Street. His clientele ran to cash customers who wanted to give up smoking or biting their nails. Kate didn\u0027t know how Monserrat came to be on B Division\u0027s books. He must have helped on previous cases. This wasn\u0027t the first time a witness to vampire crime had been fascinated into keeping schtumm. Clearing the fog would be a useful trick. If it wasn\u0027t arrant quackery. Which, in Kate\u0027s opinion, it was. Nolan sat limply in his egg-chair, hands in his lap. Monserrat had at least got him to stop taking imaginary snaps. The subject was awake, but unresponsive. Hypnotism had progressed from \u0027watch the watch\u0027. An array of multi-coloured lights mounted on one of Nolan\u0027s own tripods flashed in arcane sequence. With \u0027A Whiter Shade of Pale\u0027 leaking in from the waiting room, the studio was like a duff discotheque. Kate wished they\u0027d change the record. After hours of Procul Harem, she\u0027d have taken Any Old Iron\u0027 or \u0027I Was in Kaiser Bill\u0027s Bat-Staffel\u0027. Or, for preference, \u0027The Sound of Silence\u0027. Bellaver stood to one side, with Griffin and WPC Rogers - who\u0027d brought Monserrat to Pottery Lane - and a slim, white-haired, elderly woman. Monserrat\u0027s wife was a vampire, which meant she chose to seem the age she looked - probably to match her husband. Kate had come across that before and was not one to criticise whatever people did to make relationships work. But. Mrs Monserrat was bright-eyed and a little creepy. She stared hungrily, fangs out, at the young man under her husband\u0027s \u0027fluence. Kate didn\u0027t need a package holiday in India to know what she was thinking. It was a good job Enoch Powell wasn\u0027t here: the expression on Mrs Monserrat\u0027s face was exactly what vampire-haters were afraid of. Monserrat was getting no response from Nolan. Bellaver, bored, came over to look at the pictures. Any joy?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Fifteen rolls of it,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027Lin Tang is making prints of every exposure, but here are the contact sheets. The Fevre Dream stuff could go to the News of the Screws. It\u0027s what you\u0027d expect. Rich, beautiful, famous, horrible people having a knees-up.\u0027 \u0027So you don\u0027t get invited to Syrie Van Epp\u0027s parties?\u0027 \u0027Please - if I ever fall in with that mob, stake me. They\u0027re the worst sort of useless.\u0027 \u0027Any pictures of Carol?\u0027 \u0027Lots. At the party, and... afterwards.\u0027 \u0027How afterwards?\u0027 \u0027In a cab, I think. And in Maryon Park.\u0027 Bellaver was reminded of another avenue of inquiry. \u0027Griffin, have we rousted out last night\u0027s taxi drivers?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Super. No luck yet, but if Carol Thatcher went from the boat to the park in the small hours the cabbie should be traceable.\u0027 \u0027If it\u0027s easy, it should have been done by now, lad.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Super,\u0027 said Griffin, looking at his pointy shoes. \u0027She must have got to the park just before dawn,\u0027 said Kate. \u0027There are twilight photos. Sun-up is - what? - four, four-thirty, this time of year?\u0027 Kate laid out the contact sheets on an artist\u0027s table. An overhead light brought out the sheen of the photographic paper. Columns of glistening images, in black and white and colour. She gave Bellaver a magnifying glass. \u0027What\u0027s that pong?\u0027 the policeman asked. \u0027Chemicals,\u0027 she said. \u0027No need to call the Drug Squad.\u0027 The spell in the darkroom with Lin Tang had made her slightly light-headed. Lack of blood, exposure to sunlight and general irritability were working on her too. She wasn\u0027t seeing something. She arranged the photographs in chronological order, trying to find a story in them. She had to go against instincts and read down columns rather than across. Even that might be a mistake. The sheets read deceptively like a Japanese-Italian photo-comic, but Nolan didn\u0027t always catch relevant moments. He hadn\u0027t known he was compiling a record of the last hours of Carol Thatcher\u0027s life. More false leads than true clues. \u0027Let\u0027s play Spot the Ball,\u0027 said Bellaver, peering through the glass. \u0027Professor, can you haul Golden Boy over here?\u0027 Monserrat commanded Nolan to get up and go to the table. The hypnotist had more difficulty crossing the studio than his subject. His wife had to help. Annoyed, he tried to shrug off her firm arm-grip. Blankly, Nolan stood at the table. \u0027Does this ring any bells?\u0027 the Super asked. \u0027He only hears my voice,\u0027 said Monserrat, lisping softly. \u0027Look at the pictures, Thomas. At your pictures.\u0027 Nolan hung his head and ran his fingers over the wet sheets, as if they were secret messages in Braille. The photographer mumbled. Snatches of lyrics. Songs from the party? The most interesting thing about Nolan\u0027s pictures was that vampires showed up in them. Edwina can\u0027t have sprinkled silver talcum on everyone. Lin Tang said Nolan was conducting experiments with chemical processes and new makes of fast film. It was an obsession: finding a way of taking good likenesses of vampires. Kodak had marketed a film for the undead in the 1950s, Kate remembered. Results were iffy. Nolan wasn\u0027t fully there yet, and maybe it couldn\u0027t be done, but vampires at the party weren\u0027t invisible. Some were negative images, some see-through and some sketchy or featureless - but they were captured on film. Bellaver was interested, too. Taking mug-shots of vampires was a challenge, let alone using photographs in evidence. Some were incautious about public behaviour, since revealing pictures would not show up in the scandal sheets. If Nolan\u0027s work continued, contingent upon him getting his wits back, habits would have to change. Was Carol\u0027s death incidental? Could the real purpose of the crime committed in Maryon Park be to stop Nolan developing the art of vampire photography? \u0027Recognise any of these spooks?\u0027 Bellaver asked her. \u0027Surprisingly, yes,\u0027 Kate admitted. \u0027That\u0027s Herbert von Krolock in the lime-green shorts and t-shirt, snogging that actor from A Kind of Bleeding. What\u0027s his name, Alan Bates? The pretty boy is Paul Durward, an elder who sings a bit. I don\u0027t know the warm blonde with the cleavage who\u0027s all over him. This one is unmistakable, though I can\u0027t name any of his coterie...\u0027 She tapped a picture of a grey man. His hair was more bouffant than when she\u0027d last seen him. He kept \u0027with it\u0027 in a wide-collared dayglo suit and frilly-fronted, floppy-cuffed orange shirt. But his face was congealed death. Nolan\u0027s process showed up patches of rot on his cheeks and forehead which might not be visible to the naked eye. \u0027Caleb Croft,\u0027 said Bellaver. Kate shuddered at the name. If ever a vampire were a monster. Professor Croft was flanked by vampires in matching monk-hoods. Their faces were indistinct, hollows in the cowls. One wore a black-and-white St Bartolph\u0027s scarf. This year, everyone was seeking a guru. The thought of Croft getting his teeth or - worse - mind-hooks into young people, warm or vampire, was appalling. That scarf caught her attention. Having noticed it once, she saw it over and over. Not always on the same person. \u0027These pictures,\u0027 Monserrat said to Nolan. \u0027They are not last night, they are now. Tell us what\u0027s happening.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m on a boat,\u0027 said Nolan. \u0027It\u0027s a trip. A far-out trip.\u0027 \u0027Is there a girl?\u0027 asked the hypnotist. Even deep under the fluence, Nolan smiled. \u0027Girl. Girls.\u0027 Nolan photographed any woman who crossed his viewfinder. He even took a few exposures of Lin Tang, who had - somehow - changed her outfit two or three times during the party. Kate recognised fabulous birds from films, telly and the rotogravure. Julie Christie, Catherine Cornelius, Sandie Shaw, Moira Kent, Anita Pallenberg, Fontaine Khaled, Julie Ege, Ayesha Brough. One shot caught actress-model-singers Gillian Hills and Jane Birkin, giggling conspiratorially, regarding the camera with a gleam at once promising and predatory. Penelope Churchward, who moved in these circles, wasn\u0027t at this do; Kate thought Penny was in New York just now, keeping secrets. \u0027One girl,\u0027 said Monserrat. \u0027Carol.\u0027 In the party photographs, Carol went from extra - cut off at the sides of pictures - to leading role. She had caught Nolan\u0027s attention: a whole sheet consisted of shots of her at the party, sometimes chatting or dancing with others, but mostly on her own, smiling or puzzled. Why her, of all the girls there? Did Nolan have an instinct for spotting the soon-to-die? If so, Kate should be wary since he\u0027d snapped off a reel on her too. Was Carol flattered that the cyclops singled her out? Or spooked? For a model, but Kate thought Carol seemed uncomfortable at being photographed. That could have been pathetic fallacy, an awareness of the tragic ending shadowing innocent looks with spurious meaning. Timothy Lea was in a few early shots, stuffing his gob with canapes, then got lost in the crowd. Had he been got rid of? Lin Tang, Edwina and the wrestler - Milton - were in the pictures. Might they have hustled Timmy out of the way to give Nolan a clear run at the girl? Now, Nolan saw the ghostface girl and mumbled. \u0027Carol,\u0027 he said. \u0027Is he remembering?\u0027 asked Bellaver. \u0027She\u0027s a white flame,\u0027 said Nolan. Beyond the party photos, they came to shots taken inside the taxi Carol had been in sometime between the boat and the park. The Daughter of the Dragon said Nolan took off without her. Kate intuited that Lin Tang was still irritated by that escape, and would have been even if it hadn\u0027t ended in murder. In the cab, Carol wore the St Bartolph\u0027s scarf. Nolan used high-contrast black-and-white film. Other people were in the back of the taxi, but Nolan was working close, shooting Carol\u0027s face whenever light came through the windows. Shadows chopped across the pictures. These exposures would be blown up. Perhaps a hand - with one of those fabled, distinctive rings - might be resting on her knee in one shot? Or an array of blobs would coalesce into a recognisable culprit? Kate thought they couldn\u0027t be that lucky. Nolan was interested in Carol\u0027s face. Not some vampire licking his lips in the shadows. Even hypnotised, he was drawn to her. He put fingerprints on the sticky pictures. Having seen Carol dead, Kate was struck by how alive she\u0027d been. She understood why so many wanted to get close. Timmy Lea was lost without her. Not that he\u0027d have been able to hang on in her life if she were taken up by Nolan\u0027s circle. She was, or seemed in stills, luminous. Or perhaps Kate was projecting on a blank, dead slate. The last contact sheet was a roll of colour, taken in Maryon Park in the blue light of pre-dawn. Magic hour. Carol, trailing that scarf, walked a path towards the trees, looking over her shoulder, smiling. At Nolan, of course, but also at others. Shadows clustered on the ground. Kate couldn\u0027t help but hope Croft was there. She\u0027d waited decades for him to be caught red-mouthed. It was as likely Carol had snatched the scarf from a student and run off with it as a trophy. Why should she latch onto a mouldy professor and his inky followers? So many more exciting, dazzling, dangerous persons were on hand. \u0027That scarf,\u0027 she whispered to Bellaver. \u0027Was it found near the body?\u0027 The Super checked his notebook. \u0027Nope. Unless Griffin missed it.\u0027 \u0027There was no scarf,\u0027 confirmed Rogers, defending the sergeant. Nolan was shaking now, quite alarmingly. \u0027What are you seeing, Thomas?\u0027 Monserrat asked. \u0027Red,\u0027 he said. \u0027Sunlight, like blood. No. Blood, like sunlight.\u0027 Ideally, the final photograph would have shown Carol in a clinch with a gore-smeared monster - his (or her) face captured perfectly in the light of dawn, fanged maw open wide and guilty. Instead, it was an empty frame, or a seemingly empty frame: a blur of bushes and grass and jagged shadow, and Carol\u0027s torn-open neck and shoulder. \u0027Who\u0027s here?\u0027 Kate asked, pointing at the photograph. Monserrat passed on her question. \u0027Who\u0027s with Carol?\u0027 \u0027Eyes,\u0027 he said. \u0027Sunrise eyes. Burning blind.\u0027 \u0027He doesn\u0027t know any more,\u0027 Kate told Bellaver. \u0027If you push too far, he\u0027ll break.\u0027 \u0027Who is in this picture?\u0027 Monserrat insisted. \u0027Can\u0027t say. Eyes, ice, aieee!\u0027 Nolan\u0027s mouth was full of white froth. Some leaked onto the photos. \u0027Bring him out of it,\u0027 said Kate to Monserrat. \u0027Or he\u0027ll shrink inside his head. You\u0027ll never get him back.\u0027 Monserrat wasn\u0027t taking instructions from her, but Bellaver gave him the nod. \u0027Wake up, Thomas,\u0027 he said, \u0027in three-two-one...\u0027 Monserrat snapped his fingers and Nolan collapsed. A Thunderbirds puppet, suddenly unstrung. Despite the hypnotist\u0027s order, the photographer hadn\u0027t woken up. He\u0027d gone to sleep, which couldn\u0027t be good. WPC Rogers caught Nolan easily and heaved his deadweight upright. He came round, then found himself in the grips of a uniformed vampire and took fright. \u0027What?\u0027 Rogers patted him down as if he were a Saturday night drunk and handed him to Edwina. The make-up girl led Nolan away, promising a nice cup of tea and a suggestive biscuit. Thomas Nolan was insulated like a child. He had people to nanny him after his tantrums and coddle him when he was showing off. Bellaver looked at the disarrayed photographs and shrugged. \u0027I\u0027d say \"every little helps\", but it doesn\u0027t, does it?\u0027 Kate had to admit he was right. She took the magnifying glass and twiddled with it. She kept going over the contact sheets. There was something she wasn\u0027t seeing. Or something she was seeing she shouldn\u0027t. A notion fluttered, demanding attention - but when she looked again, through the glass, at particular pictures, she couldn\u0027t see what it was. It was mid-evening, still light out but cool. The sun that had risen on Carol Thatcher\u0027s death was going down. Kate, bone-tired and headache-hammered in daytime, felt senses sharpening with the coming of night. With dark-adapted eyes, she might see more. Edwina came back then. She had corralled someone else to make the tea. \u0027Phone call,\u0027 she said. \u0027For the Superintendent.\u0027 \u0027Probably the Chief Constable, dishing out a bollocking,\u0027 Bellaver said to Kate. \u0027He doesn\u0027t like being bothered by your lot - journalists - on Sundays, or any other time. And he likes to spread the joy.\u0027 Bellaver went to the waiting room. Kate was intrigued by Edwina\u0027s healthy throat. She was a very English girl - almost prim - with an attractive little croak in her voice. \u0027If you\u0027re thinking of biting me, luvvy, you can shove off,\u0027 she said. Kate shut her mouth and - she was sure - went red. She\u0027d be looking like a pillar-box again. She didn\u0027t drink from other women, except in the most antiseptic, unromantic of circumstances. The possibility, even, only occurred to her during dry spells. She supposed she was still a Victorian. Not that the Victorian times she remembered were any less omnisexually adventurous than the swinging \u002760s; people were just better about keeping quiet. Bellaver came back, obviously bearing bad news. \u0027The Chief Constable?\u0027 \u0027Worse. George Dixon. There\u0027s been another one. A dead girl. Another white-lips. He\u0027s not going to stop at that, is he? The bastard. It\u0027s a flaming spree.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-42.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) Rome. 1959.
