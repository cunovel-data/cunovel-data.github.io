He overheard one of the waiters call her Signorina Pipistrella. Perhaps it was what they called all dead women behind their backs. If so, it was unwise. Like bats, the dead had big, sensitive ears. He knew Penelope could segue from desperate gaiety to homicidal rage on the spin of a coin.\n They were under the Baths of Caracalla, searching out some new cabaret. Penelope had heard wondrous whispers of a coloured singing group from America, the Kool-Tones. She was one of those Europeans who valued American exports for their vitality and brashness. Tom suspected he fell into that category of American himself, though he didn\u0027t care to think of himself as either vital or brash. The last thing he wanted was to traipse through a city thousands of years older than New York in search of some doo-wop spades who couldn\u0027t get a paying gig in Harlem.\n The Kit Kat Klub was mostly underground, its entrance among ruins. An orange neon sign fizzled among the remnants of a classical frieze. Everyone was aware of the vulgarity, and took pains to distance themselves by passing ironic comment.\n \u0027It\u0027s like transforming the Taj Mahal into a music hall,\u0027 snipped Penelope.\n Though he\u0027d never seen it, Tom thought the Taj Mahal vulgar enough without cocktail waitresses dressed as French maids or crooning contortionists. Popular taste had never been good. He\u0027d heard from something disgustingly old that classical Rome had been a hideous riot of bad taste, marble covered with violent layers of ghastly paint. Busts which now seemed the essence of white serenity had originally looked like demonstration masks for circus makeup.\n They sat at a good table near the stage, talking and laughing loudly enough to drown out the struggling Kool-Tones as they did their worst to \u0027Blue Moon\u0027. Penelope jabbered to everybody but Tom, though under her wrap her clawed hand was hooked around his elbow. It was as if she were clinging to him for support, or to remind herself that one toy was still hers alone. He wondered if she were old enough to melt to nothing if her heart were punctured by silver. Probably not. She was one of those Victorians. She\u0027d dwindle to a ragged skeleton with wisps of white hair. And maggots.\n Since Princess Asa\u0027s dressing-down, Penelope had run on the edge of hysteria, under a compulsion to be terribly amusing and modern. She\u0027d rounded up this group of second-stringers and parasites from the palazzo and various bolt-holes around the city, and was leading them on yet another expedition. \u0027Damned by dawn,\u0027 was her motto.\n He was the only living man at the table except for another American, a yard-wide, corn-fed Kansas quarterback named Kent. He had won a body-beautiful contest back home and been brought to Rome to appear as Ercole in Dino de Laurentiis\u0027s motion picture of The Argonauts. It had just been announced that Sylvia Koscina was to replace Malenka in the role of Medea. Kent\u0027s hair was dyed a blue-black that would register as lustrous on film. His blocky, hero face was made thoughtful by sensible glasses, which didn\u0027t disguise eyes that missed little.\n Penelope\u0027s dead friends were the minor poet Roger Penderel, still trading thinly on the desperate disillusion he\u0027d picked up in the First World War; Irena Dubrovna, a catty little Serbian frail who kept making scratches in the tablecloth and apologising; the English avant garde painter Anthony Aloysius St John Hancock, sporting a beret and a foot-long cigarette holder; Nico Otzak, a strange, breathy German blonde thing who was either very lost or very drugged; an extremely boring 700-year-old Count; and an obscene little hunchback who communicated only in neanderthal grunts.\n From somewhere, Penelope had dug up a bright-eyed newlydead American couple, the Addamses. They laid it on thick, with off-the-peg copies of fashions set by the writers Clare Quilty and Vivian Darkbloom, the husband in an offensive pinstripe suit and the wife a clinging silk shroud. Their faces were whited-up, their hair dyed black. Mr Addams had made his money in railways and munitions, and treated his wife and himself to death and resurrection as a retirement present. She wore sweet little bat earrings.\n After the Kool-Tones had finished, with \u0027Flying Saucers Rock \u0027n\u0027 Roll\u0027, the Kit Kat Klub offered the once-in-a-lifetime-and-thank-heavens-for-it pairing of the stately Bianca Castafiore, the \u0027Milanese Nightingale\u0027, and the \u0027beat poet\u0027 Max Brock, a Yank in a false beard. The poet began free-associating run-together words, many inappropriate for mixed company, while the diva screeched wordlessly behind him.\n \u0027This is my Song for Europe,\u0027 Brock began:\n A sad serenade of Sisyphean solicitude,\n Strangling the strange seraphim of shameless slop\n Gurgling in a gutter of galloping garbage\n Gorging itself on gross guppies of Grecian goo,\n Humiliatingly humping Henry Harry Herman Herbert Hoover\n Haruspex of horribility, holocaust of human heartburn,\n While in the icebox, it is the children\u0027s hour...\n La Castafiore hit a high note that made the dead react like dogs to a silent whistle, gritting their fangs and jamming napkins in their ears. Tom realised he was enjoying the performance.\n I spent my birthday in a telephone box,\n Sorting out your present of igneous rocks...\n Max Brock paused, aghast that he had accidentally produced a rhyming couplet, and stamped around the stage in fury, tossing rhetorical questions into the audience like hand grenades.\n \u0027What\u0027s the taste of purple? When\u0027s the colour of February? What\u0027s on second? Why did the bat cross the moon? What\u0027s the thirty-nine steps? Who is the Mother of Tears?\u0027\n Someone hissed. Seriously. Not like a disgruntled patron, but like an angry serpent from hell.\n Max Brock turned his back on the audience. La Castafiore shrieked a trill. Glasses exploded all around the club. Shards and blood spattered over the table.\n \u0027Cool, man,\u0027 someone shouted. \u0027Straight from the fridge!\u0027\n Irena laughed like a kitten and Nico looked at the girl as if she were dinner. Penderel made a drunken point about metre, and hailed Max Brock the greatest poet of an age that couldn\u0027t, by very definition, produce even a good poet.\n \u0027You say he\u0027s great, but not good?\u0027 asked Mr Addams, eyebrows doing a Groucho wiggle. \u0027That seems to be a contradiction.\u0027\n \u0027I say he\u0027s great, and utterly dreadful. This is the age of dreadful. Don\u0027t you agree Mr Hancock?\u0027\n \u0027Not half,\u0027 said the English painter, who was taking napkins out of his ears and might not have heard the question. \u0027I should cocoa. That bloke\u0027s got a flaming nerve.\u0027\n \u0027I like that in a man,\u0027 cooed Mrs Addams, sucking in her cheeks to make a black bow of her mouth.\n \u0027Who is your favourite poet, Mr Kent?\u0027 Penelope asked, cruelly.\n \u0027Walt Whitman,\u0027 he replied.\n \u0027Very Herculean,\u0027 she commented, tartly.\n Tom admired romantics and decadents, but recognised a puritan-American streak in himself that deplored moderns who might think themselves romantic or decadent. Like this mob.\n \u0027Eddy Poe, the writer on Argonauts, says he hasn\u0027t written poetry since he turned,\u0027 said Kent. \u0027He claims creativity dries up when you become a vampire.\u0027\n \u0027In my case, that\u0027s not true,\u0027 said Penderel. \u0027I was a mediocre verse-man when alive.\u0027\n \u0027My genius is immortal, mush,\u0027 said Hancock, aggressively. \u0027I\u0027m AB negative, you know. It\u0027s all I can drink.\u0027\n \u0027No offence,\u0027 said Kent, \u0027but I\u0027ve met so few of you. Vampires.\u0027\n \u0027Oscar Wilde wrote \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\" after he turned,\u0027 said Mrs Addams. \u0027You have to admit that\u0027s good.\u0027\n Penelope\u0027s eyes narrowed. She didn\u0027t care for talk of Wilde. Even doubly dead, he was an embarrassment.\n \u0027Dali is a vampire,\u0027 Nico said.\n \u0027Never liked him,\u0027 Hancock moaned. \u0027All those bowler hats.\u0027\n \u0027But Picasso is a warm man,\u0027 put in Kent. \u0027And T. S. Eliot, Thomas Mann, Shostakovich, Joe DiMaggio, Ludwig Wittgenstein, William Faulkner. None of them turned. Yet they\u0027re the century\u0027s best.\u0027\n \u0027Their careers have ended, or will end,\u0027 said Mrs Addams. \u0027To turn is to change, to embrace a darkness within. It must be a spur to creativity. Since I turned vampire, I have been far better able to express myself.\u0027\n She was what they used to call a \u0027murgatroyd\u0027. Having risen from the grave, she was determined to dress the part. Almost invisible on her jet hair was a black lace veil, weighted by black pearls. Her low-cut, floor-length dress had trails like octopus tentacles. Her pallor was artificially heightened, with strategic dabs of violet shadow.\n Kent, who had a mind inside his muscle, was working through a private problem.\n \u0027Maybe there are better ways to become immortal. Through work, perhaps? Or by having children?\u0027\n Penelope was on the point of ripping off Tom\u0027s arm.\n \u0027I\u0027ll take immortality any way I can get it, old fellow,\u0027 said Penderel, signalling the waitress to come open her vein into his beer stein. \u0027Sometimes it doesn\u0027t last long.\u0027\n Kent shrugged, Hercules shoulders straining his lightweight blue suit. He\u0027d have looked conservative but for the red and yellow swirl of his hand-painted necktie.\n \u0027What about the existentialists?\u0027 asked Mrs Addams. \u0027Surely, their ideal modern man is a vampire? A being outside hypocrisy and convention? A creature alone in the night? Appetites and urges unfettered by history?\u0027\n \u0027History is all some of us have,\u0027 said the Carpathian, Oblensky.\n Tom had read Camus and Sartre and didn\u0027t see what all the fuss was about. Thin books with thinner stories.\n \u0027History could end at any moment,\u0027 said Nico, making an explosion in the air with her fingers. \u0027Ka-pow!\u0027\n \u0027Ah yes,\u0027 mused Penderel, \u0027the boom-boom Bomb.\u0027\n A dance band began playing. Penelope cut short the philosophy by forcing everyone onto the floor. She claimed Tom for herself, and partnered Kent with Mrs Addams, Penderel with Nico, Hancock with Irena, and Mr Addams with the surprisingly light-footed and enthusiastic hunchback. Count Oblensky scooped a warm film extra out of the crowd, and nibbled her throat sickeningly.\n Penelope, brought up not to look into her dancing partner\u0027s eyes, held her spine ramrod straight, stretching her lovely neck to advantage.\n The dead made dance halls tricky prospects. They clung to the fashions of their lifetimes, yet wished to be seen to embrace the modern. Penelope had learned to dance when the waltz was dominant, but elders were schooled in mediaeval gavottes or rowdy Russian kicking. Moderns carried over elements of the Charleston or the jitterbug.\n The band played neutral dance music. A skinny crooner sang \u0027Volare\u0027 as if he meant it. The floor accommodated everyone\u0027s writhing. Mercifully, it was dark.\n Penelope was thinking. Tom knew that made her dangerous.\n Her hand crept up his back, fingers settling around his neck. She twisted his head and looked at him. Her fangs were out.\n \u0027Beautiful, blank-faced Tom,\u0027 she said. \u0027I wonder what goes on in there. But, also, I wonder what goes on in here.\u0027\n She touched the extended finger of her free hand to her head then her heart.\n \u0027Do I really feel anything?\u0027\n Tom was uncomfortable. Did she want him to reassure her of her humanity, or confirm her elite estrangement from the living?\n \u0027Or only imitations of feelings? Animal instincts tricked up for a complicated brain. I wasn\u0027t prepared for any of this, Tom. I was going to be a wife and mother. A hostess, a lady of some standing.\u0027\n Her tongue slipped across her fangs.\n \u0027Am I even a woman?\u0027\n Tom would rather have answered one of Max Brock\u0027s nonsense questions.\n \u0027I\u0027m dead, Tom,\u0027 she said, piteously. \u0027Hold me.\u0027\n \u0027I am holding you, Penny.\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n They danced on, not missing a step.\n Tom knew he would have to tread carefully. He was close enough to see how unstable Penelope really was. She could pose as an ornament, displaying pleasure and amusement in such a way as not to stretch her face out of its beautiful true. But sometimes, there were cracks. And beyond cracks, the chasm.\n Princess Asa was behind some of it. For a Victorian to be treated as a vassal by a mediaeval tyrant was humiliation enough. But the Princess was just the most recent irritant. Penelope\u0027s moods went deeper, and her troubles back to the age of Wilde and the Terror.\n In the end, it was Dracula. And perhaps her onetime fiance, this Charles. Tom knew both men were nearby, yet distant from Penelope. Had she come to Rome because of them?\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Tom,\u0027 she said, hugging him. \u0027It\u0027s unfair of me to go on like this.\u0027\n He relaxed. She was thinking about him for a moment, not herself. Excellent.\n \u0027I\u0027m also sorry about this, but...\u0027 She bit his neck, deeper than usual, opening the old bite-wounds. The pain was a shock. Her fingers dug into his ribs. She sucked ferociously.\n They were still dancing. Others were bleeding. No one noticed.\n For the first time, Tom felt panic.\n The dead were dangerous. Really.\n She set him down gently on a chair, letting him slip from her hands. He couldn\u0027t move his limbs or even hold up his head. As he slipped into a daze, he saw Penelope dab her lips with a napkin.\n She looked as if she had made a decision. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-11.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) \n Rome. 1959.
