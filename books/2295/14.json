He was very cold, and so depleted of blood that his fingers and toes tingled. He had blacked out propped in a chair, near the coat-rack. His knees had buckled, and when he woke, he was curled up behind the coats, shivering.\\n\\n What had Penelope been thinking?\\n\\n Actually, he knew all too well. She\u0027d stopped seeing him as a person, and started seeing him as a convenience. Most people treated most other people like that most of the time. He certainly did.\\n\\n He had been afraid she would suck his mind empty.\\n\\n If she knew about Dickie Fountain, she might kill him on principle, assuming he planned to do to her what he had done to him. That wouldn\u0027t have been fair. Penny was different, and deserved different treatment. Tom was involved with her for what he could get, he admitted that. He did not necessarily plan to destroy her.\\n\\n Though...\\n\\n He stood up, unsteady. He must have looked as pale as a ghost.\\n\\n Music still played. \u0027Papaverie Papare\u0027. Some of the group he had come in with were still here. The Dubrovna chit wasn\u0027t getting far in putting the moves on Kent. Tom looked about for Penny, but couldn\u0027t find her.\\n\\n A waiter was ready for him with a tonic, a thick English fruit drink dosed with vitamins and iron. Vimto. He drank it down, not minding the taste, and asked for more. It was provided.\\n\\n It took a certain genius, he recognised, to spot a gap in the market and fill it. Though never advertised explicitly as such, Vimto was what the living lovers of vampires drank to get their strength back up again after a bleeding.\\n\\n He had no idea if it did any good.\\n\\n He was told that the signora had ordered the drink for him before leaving.\\n\\n That showed some consideration.\\n\\n His bites itched and it was all he could do to prevent himself scratching them raw. He seemed to have lost substance. His clothes hung loose on him. There was an insect buzz in his ears.\\n\\n A third Vimto at least got liquid back into him.\\n\\n What now?\\n\\n On the street, among ruins, Tom let the brief chill of the dead of night clear his head. The cool wouldn\u0027t last. He smoked a cigarette and tried to ignore the feeding and fumbling taking place all around in the dark. Mr and Mrs Addams had forced Max Brock against a column, and were furiously sucking at several bites. Mrs Addams was soothing the poet with threats about leeching away all his talent. Max Brock was looking up at the stars, at a temporary and merciful loss for words. Tom hoped the Addamses had killed the opera singer first. It was important to get one\u0027s priorities right.\\n\\n \u0027Ciao, Tom. You have escaped from Penelope, then?\u0027\\n\\n It was Marcello, the Italian reporter who was always hanging around, who\u0027d been at the airport when Count Kernassy and what-was-her-name had arrived, who\u0027d been there when that strange Irish dead girl saw the Count being murdered.\\n\\n \u0027Other way round, old fellow.\u0027\\n\\n Marcello looked drained too, but had no obvious bites. His cheeks were sunken. The reflective lenses of his dark glasses suggested the empty eye sockets of a skull.\\n\\n \u0027You look as if you\u0027ve had a bad night of it,\u0027 Tom said.\\n\\n \u0027You too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t argue with that. Damn all dead bitches.\u0027\\n\\n Marcello bummed a cigarette and lit up, exhaling with weary anger.\\n\\n \u0027I have been to Hell and back,\u0027 the Italian announced.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t make it back.\u0027\\n\\n Marcello laughed.\\n\\n \u0027I would gladly exchange you Signorina Churchward for Signorina Reed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Little Irish corpse?\u0027\\n\\n It took Marcello a moment to catch on. \u0027Si. Little Irish corpse. She has a grip, that one. Will not let go. We went to I Cessati Spiriti.\u0027\\n\\n Tom whistled.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t suppose either of you chaps could lend a hand,\u0027 said a deep, bone-tired voice.\\n\\n It was a dead man, in a suit that had suffered. He\u0027d plainly been in a fight. Several fights. Wounds in his clothes looked like bullet holes, and one sleeve was skinned away completely.\\n\\n \u0027I think we\u0027ve something in common. I\u0027m back from Hell and abandoned by a vampire girl too.\u0027\\n\\n He took a few steps out of the dark and collapsed.\\n\\n Marcello looked at Tom over the dead man\u0027s back. He shrugged. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-14.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) \\n Rome. 1959.
