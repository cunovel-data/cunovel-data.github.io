{"id":93135,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"CAT O\u0027NINE TAILS Mildly distracted, Genevieve pressed the button for her landing and looked through her purse for her keys. Though not of a sun-shunning bloodline, she\u0027d run late throughout the day and missed the bank. However the world might change, bankers were not about to alter their opening hours for the benefit of the nocturnal. She was living off investments which yielded enough to cover her expenses. She was supposed to be getting familiar with Charles\u0027s estate on the assumption that she\u0027d soon be its trustee. She\u0027d made him swear not to leave it all to her. A particularly distasteful species of vampire gold-digging involved ensnaring hapless mortals to the point where they bequeathed you all their worldly goods, waiting for the inevitable, then cashing in and looking around for the next prospect. She didn\u0027t want the world to remember Charles Beauregard as her dupe. The lift ascended with its usual clanks and rattles. She found her keys. Something in the air caught her attention. Spilled blood. Spent energy. A hint of cordite. Damn. It was starting all over again. Couldn\u0027t she leave Charles alone for an afternoon? Just before her floor, the lift shrieked to a stop. Then, chains hauling, it rose again, by inches. Metal and something else screamed. Through the cage door, she saw a dangling dress. A broken white mannequin leg kicked. People were on the landing. Hamish Bond, and a flat-headed goon she didn\u0027t recognise. A panic hand took her heart. Was Charles hurt? Worse? She wasn\u0027t ready. Despite his gentle drifting away, she wasn\u0027t ready to lose him. Just a few more weeks. Days, even. Things had to be settled first. If this was love, it was horrible. A crushed body writhed in front of the cage doors, jammed between the slightly parted outer doors and the pull-across screen of the lift itself. It was pinned at the neck between the edge of the doorway and the top of the lift, head stuck out into the shaft. The scream was musical. The neck came apart and the thing in the dress fell, spewing clockwork. Bond coughed up blood. His once-immaculate dinner jacket was sliced to ribbons across his sides. Flattop stood over the British spy, harrowing hands reaching down. She\u0027d put a stop to this. Tearing the cage door open, she stepped onto the landing and fixed Flattop with her eyes. The creature was brutish, but had a brain. He could be willed to stand down. The automaton would have been different. Genevieve made tiny fists and reached out with her mind. Flattop staggered. He snarled, mouth showing metal. The apartment door was smashed. She saw ruins in the passage. This was going to be expensive. She was coldly furious. \u0027Commander Bond, explain this.\u0027 Bond couldn\u0027t stop coughing. Holes in his throat healed. \u0027I\u0027d best take that initiative,\u0027 said an unfamiliar voice. She hadn\u0027t sensed any presence, so it must be someone old, with powers. \u0027I am Brastov.\u0027 She\u0027d heard of him. A tall, wide man stood in shadows, forked beard giving his head a distinctive shape. In his hands was a large white cat which shone in a shaft of moonlight from a high window. The cat\u0027s slit eyes were scarlet. The man wore a Chinese-style mauve cotton jacket and muzhik pantaloons. \u0027I wish only an interview, for the moment,\u0027 said Brastov. Genevieve realised she had made a too-easy assumption about this creature. She wondered if Bond had been misled too. She remembered Charles mentioning this Brastov, the Cat Man. He was supposed to be a Soviet spymaster. \u0027You are Genevieve Dieudonne, an elder,\u0027 said the Cat Man. \u0027An innocent party, perhaps, but involved. I shall have to ask you to accompany Mr Bond.\u0027 She extruded claws. \u0027If you put up no fight, we shall leave Charles Beauregard as he is and not put him to the trouble of coming along with you.\u0027 She drew in her nails. \u0027He is overexcited, but unhurt. You have the word of Brastov that no harm was intended to him. He has a reputation in our profession. One would not wish to show disrespect.\u0027 Brastov\u0027s voice was snake-like, hypnotic. Thick fingers kneaded the fur of the cat\u0027s throat. \u0027That old man saw off three of your best,\u0027 Bond spat. \u0027Indeed he did,\u0027 Brastov purred, suavely unruffled. \u0027Lessons have been learned. A car waits downstairs. You will come with us.\u0027 Genevieve stiffened. \u0027You may look in on Mr Beauregard, Mademoiselle. I am not without feeling. But only for a moment.\u0027 She nodded gratefully. Flattop blocked the smashed doorway. \u0027If you would recover Olympia\u0027s head,\u0027 Brastov ordered his underling. \u0027It would be a shame to lose such an ingenious and pleasing device. She can be rebuilt.\u0027 Flattop grunted and got out of the way. He reached into the lift shaft and wrestled free the object he found there. The automaton\u0027s eyes blinked. Genevieve stepped into the flat. The hallway was littered with wet clay. Charles was in his study, propped in his chair, breathing heavily. He seemed stunned. There was a weal on his cheek, a rising bruise. She smoothed the crumpled carpet - she knew it sometimes trapped his wheelchair - and checked Charles\u0027s pulse. His eyes opened fractionally, telling her he was awake. \u0027You are satisfied as to his health?\u0027 asked Brastov. He was in the flat now, eyes on them. \u0027To strike a man his age,\u0027 she protested. \u0027My associate will be punished. He doesn\u0027t like fire.\u0027 Charles smiled, too tiny an expression to register across the room. Genevieve adjusted the blanket over his knees and felt under it for his hands. Her fingers closed on something cold. Bond\u0027s gun. Charles pressed it on her. She manipulated it out from under the blanket and into her armpit, hidden under her shawl. Charles patted her hand. She kissed his forehead. \u0027Very touching,\u0027 Brastov commented. \u0027Now, if you will be so kind as to come along. Mr Bond has had a trying evening.\u0027 By the time they were out of the apartment, the pistol was in her handbag. Genevieve and Bond were blindfolded and hustled into a Daimler. They were driven a short way and assisted out of the vehicle and through an iron gate which scraped on gravel. \u0027You\u0027ll have been memorising tiny sounds and scents, to fix the journey,\u0027 said Brastov. \u0027I too have played that game. It is no matter. If your Diogenes Club isn\u0027t up on our addresses, I should be very surprised.\u0027 The blindfolds were removed. They were in a large garden, with nondescript ruins. The man with the cat stood by an entrance to a tunnel sloping down into the earth. He led the way inside. Genevieve and Bond followed. Flattop brought up the rear. The passage was narrow and low. They were taken through catacombs. Flattop kept banging his forehead against the rock roof. Alcoves in the walls contained hunched-over corpses, preserved bags of bones. Some faces were twisted in death, as if they had been walled up alive. \u0027\"For the love of God, Montresor,\"\u0027 Genevieve quoted. \u0027Yes indeed,\u0027 said Brastov, amused. \u0027Do you know Mr Poe? He is in Rome at the moment. One sees him at social gatherings, glooming about in the corner. De Laurentiis has him under contract. He has been working on the script for one of those Cinecitta epics, Gli Argonauti.\u0027 The passage widened into a chamber. Its walls were made from jawless skulls, layered like macabre bricks. Flattop reached for a particular relic, sliding thick fingers into empty eye-sockets. He pulled the skull and the wall parted, sliding out of the way. \u0027Come through, into our lair,\u0027 said Brastov. The man with the cat stepped into the dark beyond the wall of skulls. Lights automatically came on. Without needing to be prodded, Genevieve and Bond followed. They stood on a platform which descended like a miner\u0027s lift, into a huge underground space. The cavern was hewn out of naked rock, shored up with modernist steel struts. Banks of equipment stood among broken classical columns and armless, headless statues. Large television screens hung from stalactites. Symbols crawled across animated maps of various continents. Devices the size and shape of refrigerators, huge whirring spools of tape on their fronts, stood in ranks between rock-pools - up-to-date computers. Pretty girls in tailored white jumpsuits were busy with the equipment, receiving and sending messages, tabulating information. Swarthy men in orange boiler suits watched over them, sub-machine guns casually slung over their shoulders. They walked through the operations centre and were shown into changing rooms. Bond was allowed a shower and given a fresh suit of clothes. Genevieve considered the evening gown she was offered, but decided to stick with her current practical outfit. She didn\u0027t want to put down her handbag for fear of losing the gun. While Bond sang a calypso in the shower, Genevieve looked at the hard-faced matron assigned to watch over them. She was a new-born, with typically slavic features. Few of the people in Brastov\u0027s lair were obvious Russians or even Eastern Europeans, though his operation was strictly Soviet, often at odds with the Italian Communist Party and even the local criminal organisations. Bond emerged from the changing room, perfectly groomed. He wore a lightweight suit, charcoal grey, with a double-knit blue tie. He expected her to compliment him on how he looked, but she disappointed him. She was too concerned with Charles, back at the flat alone, perhaps hurt. The matron ushered them into a luxuriously appointed office. The famously stolen Basil Hallward portrait of Lord Ruthven hung behind a desk the size of an aircraft carrier. A clump of life-sized mannequins dangled from a wooden frame, posed in a strange array. Genevieve saw a gap and guessed that was where Olympia had been. The most impressive of the remaining dolls was an eight-armed dancing Kali. The man with the cat was behind the desk, face again in deep shadows. A spotlight fell on the cat\u0027s white fur. The animal luxuriated, as if sunbathing. \u0027May I offer you something to drink?\u0027 said Brastov. \u0027We have a well-stocked cellar. There are always expendable warmfellows. You may kill one if you wish, Mr Bond. After your exertion, you must have a touch of the red thirst.\u0027 Genevieve wouldn\u0027t trust Brastov not to palm off a hopeless drug addict or tertiary syphilitic. She declined his offer. So, after a moment\u0027s thought, did Bond. \u0027Very well. To business.\u0027 The cat stretched on the desk, rolling over. He was the size of an Alsatian, and doubly fanged. Pampered, but obviously a terror to his prey. \u0027We were most saddened by the loss of Anibas Vajda.\u0027 There was steel in the conventional sentiment. \u0027So were we,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I doubt that. Her loyalties wavered. At the time of her decease, they were wavering in our direction. Frankly, we wondered if you mightn\u0027t have eliminated her yourself.\u0027 \u0027As it happens, I didn\u0027t. Not for want of trying.\u0027 \u0027That is as we thought, Mr Bond. This business between us, between East and West, may seem impenetrable to outsiders like Mademoiselle Dieudonne, but we understand the game, we know its rules. In this instance, we were playing for a very small prize, the possibility of exerting influence on the House of Vajda and, through that, getting close to Prince Dracula. He still has a certain following in our sphere of influence, and is capricious regarding the use to which he puts it. He could be useful or a nuisance to either of us. Since the war, he has sat in his palazzo, withdrawn from the world. He has had such moods before. They do not last.\u0027 Despite herself, Genevieve was interested. She gathered the Russians were as in the dark as anyone else about il principe\u0027s intentions. \u0027This Crimson Executioner is the tool of a third force,\u0027 said the Cat Man. \u0027A major player, perhaps. But not one who has stepped into the field honestly. We speak of a hider in the shadows.\u0027 Genevieve almost laughed. \u0027One might think some Chinese mastermind from an earlier era were reviving his enterprises in the present day.\u0027 She knew whom he meant. \u0027Or one of the others - Herr Doktor Mabuse, Monsieur Anthony Zenith, even the astronomy professor. We thought them all retired or dead, but those conditions are seldom permanent with such men. In the second half of this century, the nature of shadow kings has changed. Secret societies abound, but they have become like corporations. You saw the wonderful boxes outside, adding machines and thinking machines and killing machines. Where are the robes and rites and curses of yesteryear? Do you know, Mr Bond, I miss all that. In my network, I have as many accountants as assassins.\u0027 \u0027One hopes they are of better quality,\u0027 Bond said, resting his hand on one of Kali\u0027s upper arms. \u0027Or I should fear even for the Kremlin\u0027s deep pockets.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re not quite at that stage, old fellow.\u0027 Kali\u0027s eyes sprung open. Bond wasn\u0027t startled. \u0027She is more than a machine,\u0027 Brastov commented. \u0027Kali is a work of art, plaything of an ancient despot. You have to admire the artificer who could bring such a beauty to life. Her embrace is final but her victims die in unspeakable ecstasy. Really. Spirit mediums have sought them out in the afterlife to confirm it.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve had too many final embraces these last few days.\u0027 The cat\u0027s mouth opened in a mocking yawn. \u0027That you have, Mr Bond. You sought out Charles Beauregard to quiz him about the Crimson Executioner?\u0027 Genevieve had guessed as much. She felt a knot of useless anger. Later, if they survived, she\u0027d settle with the British spy. He had pointlessly endangered a dying man. Like Brastov, he was so intent on his game that he never gave a thought to the breakable human pieces. \u0027I imagine he thinks along the same lines as myself. He is a man of quality.\u0027 \u0027He mentioned the possibility that friends of yours might be involved,\u0027 ventured Bond. \u0027Mario Balato\u0027s shower.\u0027 Brastov hissed a laugh. \u0027He might have mentioned the possibility, but he would not subscribe to it. Our unruly children are a bother, I admit. They believe in too much, don\u0027t know the rules of the game. Another unwelcome twentieth century trait. But this isn\u0027t their sort of business. No, we\u0027ve to look a little deeper, under the stones. The answer to this question is old, as old perhaps as Rome.\u0027 Bond shrugged. \u0027Mademoiselle,\u0027 Brastov addressed her, \u0027have you heard of Mater Lachrymarum?\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s supposed to be one of Three Mothers,\u0027 Genevieve said. \u0027Witches or Goddesses or Patron Demons - Mater Suspiriorum, the Mother of Sighs; Mater Tenebrarum, the Mother of Darkness; and Mater Lachrymarum, the Mother of Tears. Guardians of the Sick Soul of Europe, or some such. Thomas De Quincey wrote an essay about them.\u0027 \u0027You impress me. I had expected that. Officially, I have little time for such arcane nonsense. It smacks of alchemy and pointed hats. Moscow deplores such things as un-socialist. But I have many sources. Mater Lachrymarum, the Mother of Tears, is the oldest of the three, and her legend is inextricably bound up with the history of Rome. She was here before Romulus and Remus, they say. She has presided over her invisible court throughout the city\u0027s history. Caligula sacrificed to her and Rodrigo Borgia was her lover before he became Holy Father. Myths and rumours and fairy tales, but at their heart is a truth that affects us all. There\u0027s a whisper that the Mother of Tears is more than an ur-legend and that this Crimson Executioner is in her thrall.\u0027 Genevieve realised they\u0027d been brought here not to be questioned, but to be given an answer. This was all about dropping a name. Mater Lachrymarum. The interview was ended. Brastov had concluded his business. One of them would be let free, to do with the information as they would. The other would be killed, to underline the seriousness of the matter. \u0027Perhaps you\u0027d care to dance with Kali,\u0027 Brastov said. The automaton\u0027s spider-arms closed, just missing Bond\u0027s chest. The Cat Man laughed. Genevieve took the Walther out of her bag and tossed it to Bond. He was the one who knew how to use the wretched thing. He stepped forward, drew perfect aim, and shot the man behind the desk. In the chest, twice. The cat-minder snapped into his swivel chair, then pitched slowly onto his face. She couldn\u0027t believe Bond had made such a mistake. \u0027That was hardly gracious,\u0027 said Brastov. \u0027Russians are so hard to train.\u0027 Bond was astonished. Genevieve was exasperated. \u0027Not the man, you idiot,\u0027 Genevieve shouted. \u0027The cat!\u0027 Brastov flowed across the desk like furred lightning, padding on swelling paws. He assumed a slightly more human shape, back legs longer, forepaws fingered. Bond shot again, but barely brushed Brastov\u0027s shrinking tail. A flap opened in the wall and Brastov slipped through it. Bond was at a complete loss. Genevieve shook her head. \u0027I\u0027ll get you out of here alive,\u0027 Genevieve said to him, feeling her talons and teeth coming, gathering the fighting strength she was about to need. \u0027But that\u0027s it. You\u0027ll be on your own. My patience with this silly game is exhausted.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-10.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) Rome. 1959.
