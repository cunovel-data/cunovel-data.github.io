{"id":93166,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"Even on a Sunday afternoon, the high-ceilinged waiting room of Thomas Nolan\u0027s studio was crowded with aspirant models of all sexes. Kate had never seen so many long legs, knobbly vertebrae and knife-blade cheekbones. Pulses throbbed in throats, wrists and ankles. She wouldn\u0027t know where to bite, for fear of scraping bone. Pretty creatures perched on low, backless couches like uncomfortable grasshoppers. They wore in fancy dress: astronaut, flamingo, cowgirl, Boy Scout. Glass-top tables had still-life arrangements of foreign-language magazines the waifs couldn\u0027t read and exotic fruits they wouldn\u0027t eat. Big black-and-white movie star posters hung on whitewashed walls. Bogart in a white tux, Rita Hayworth as Gilda, Jack Andrus as Ulysses, Bardot on a motorbike, Byron Orlok as Clayface, Theda Bara as Countess Addhema, Toby Dammit gaunt and drugged. Someone had reddened their eyes with magic marker and added fangs to black-lipped mouths. She didn\u0027t get the point. A chrome-and-crystal American jukebox played Procul Harem. She glanced at the selection panel: \u0027A Whiter Shade of Pale\u0027, over and over. ...her face, at first just ghostleeeee, turned... Nolan\u0027s Chinese personal assistant was present, issuing orders to minions. Kate was surprised - the PA was the woman she knew as the Daughter of the Dragon. She\u0027d used more elaborate names, but now called herself Lin Tang. Kate hadn\u0027t kept track of the woman, but heard the Lord of Strange Deaths, her father, had joined his ancestors. Before the ceiling fell in on his Limehouse lair, he had issued his customary statement, \u0027the world shall hear from me again\u0027. So far, it hadn\u0027t. \u0027Kate,\u0027 Lin Tang acknowledged, stone-faced. \u0027And some official gentlemen.\u0027 Shorter and slighter even than her, Lin Tang wore a black miniskirt, vinyl kinky boots and a sleeveless top consisting of gold rings sewn together. Her hair once fell unbound to her knees. Now, she had sharp-cut fringes and showed the nape of her neck. Kate remembered the Daughter as a hapkido whirlwind in 1896, dicing Carpathian Guardsmen with twin scimitars in the Battle of Lamb\u0027s Conduit Street. Did anyone else here realise the tiny woman was more dangerous than the bald, pockmarked wrestler who barred the inner doors? He was for show: arms crossed like the genie in Aladdin, single earring, flower painted on his forehead. Lin Tang might have inherited him from her father. In the \u002790s, a time of odd alliances, Kate and the Daughter had served in different branches of the Underground dedicated to the overthrow of Prince Dracula. Then, Lin Tang dutifully carried out her dreadful father\u0027s bidding. Later, she turned against him - for love, Kate understood - and made her own way in the world. Good for her. Not a vampire, she seemed about the same age as she had eighty years ago. Her family had access to potions and elixirs. Like vampirism, they carried a high, invisible price. The Lord came to resemble a Chinese mummy. Lin Tang\u0027s painted face might crack yet. Bellaver searched through his pockets for his warrant card, and found it only after Griffin had flashed police I.D. at Lin Tang. \u0027We\u0027d like a word with Mr Nolan, miss... ?\u0027 Lin Tang gave nothing away. \u0027It is a serious matter,\u0027 Bellaver insisted. The wrestler shifted a little. In this bubbleworld, B Division\u0027s authority was scarcely recognised. No wonder the Super was wary of the case. When Kate started as a crime reporter, policemen found it almost impossible to interview anyone of superior social standing. Well-born ruffians of the 1880s, like Caleb Croft and his chums generations earlier, could more or less get away with anything. In this egalitarian age, being famous - no matter what for - earned the privileges which once came with title and estates. \u0027Thomas is not to be disturbed,\u0027 said Lin Tang. The doors opened behind the wrestler, bumping him out of the way. Thomas Nolan, more wasted than Toby Dammit in the poster, stalked out, blond hair wild, brick-dust streaks on his blinding white jeans. Not a tall man, he displaced a lot of air. Behind him somewhere, a woman sobbed. Lin Tang noticed the Presence. \u0027Thomas looks disturbed to me,\u0027 said Bellaver. The photographer began inspecting the crop of models, pinching chins and staring into eyes. None spoke. \u0027Hopeless, useless, spotty, malnourished, too tall... t\u0027chah! The lot of you, out out out!\u0027 The astronaut misted up the inside of her plastic bubble helmet and passed out. Her spacesuit had a vent which exposed her miraculously flat midriff in a manner not advised for extra-vehicular activity. Lin Tang clapped her hands, like her father signalling that more Western barbarians be tossed into the river. The models were banished, though Kate guessed they\u0027d be replaced by interchangeables within the half-hour. The cowgirl took the spacegirl with her. \u0027You must be joking,\u0027 he said to Bellaver. Then he came to Kate... \u0027...but you... interest me.\u0027 He made a square with thumbs and forefingers and looked through it at her. \u0027Snappy snappy,\u0027 he said. \u0027Teeth please.\u0027 \u0027He means smile,\u0027 said Lin Tang. \u0027I means teeth,\u0027 said Thomas. Kate opened her mouth, as if for the dentist. Her fangs slid out of gumsheaths. Often, her teeth noticed she fancied someone before her brain did. Thomas Nolan. She felt a sting of interest. Meanwhile, he saw her as an object. Damn. She\u0027d been here before. \u0027Lovely gnashers,\u0027 he said. \u0027Come in and we\u0027ll expose some film.\u0027 \u0027But I\u0027m... I don\u0027t... no reflection. No pictures.\u0027 He smiled, tightly. \u0027Let\u0027s see if we can do something about that, luv. You\u0027re definitely what I want.\u0027 If this was the only way in, then. Thomas led her into the inner studio. The wrestler thought better of stopping Bellaver from following. The building was a former carriage-works. The studio still smelled of wood and horses. Large sheets of white or pastel paper were tacked to the walls. Cameras and lamps perched on stands. The sobbing woman was a vampire, another tall blonde bone-bag in a silvery evening dress. Barefoot, her soles were grubby from the uncarpeted floor. Kate recognised Barbara von Weidenborn, a professional artists\u0027 model under the name Barbarushka. A twig of the Dracula family tree, she was now in abject distress, like a harem bed-warmer who has failed to please the sultan and is doomed to the oubliette. Lin Tang snapped long-nailed fingers. The wrestler escorted the Dracutwig off the premises. Kate trusted there were no trapdoors hereabouts for such poor things. The Daughter must have moderated her methods of disposing of people, though brief acquaintance suggested Thomas Nolan could be as cold-blooded as the Lord of Strange Deaths. Kate saw what Barbarushka\u0027s problem was. Scattered on the floor were developing Polaroid photographs, all of strange shadows on white paper. \u0027I won\u0027t photograph either,\u0027 she insisted. Nolan summoned an attractive, auburn-haired woman. She wore a black sweater and britches and had a cinema usherette\u0027s tray slung around her neck, full of cosmetics rather than ice cream tubs. \u0027Edwina,\u0027 he ordered, \u0027do your magic.\u0027 The woman started puffing powder at Kate\u0027s face. It tingled, oddly. Her eyes watered. \u0027That\u0027s got silver in it,\u0027 she said, gripping Edwina\u0027s wrists. \u0027It\u0027s so you\u0027ll show up,\u0027 Nolan said. \u0027I don\u0027t necessarily want to,\u0027 said Kate. Edwina was strong, Kate realised. She might well be up to a tussle. Bellaver stood back, amused. Kate had not signed up for whatever this was, especially if it involved disfigurement. \u0027Mr Nolan is working on processes to photograph vampires,\u0027 Lin Tang explained. \u0027You have such a look,\u0027 the photographer said. \u0027But if it\u0027s not on film, it\u0027s wasted.\u0027 \u0027That argument only works on girls who get older,\u0027 she said. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t you like to see your own face?\u0027 \u0027Not really. People weren\u0027t kind about it.\u0027 Nolan was puzzled. \u0027She means she has red hair,\u0027 Lin Tang said. \u0027When she was warm, Western women with red hair were considered hideous...\u0027 Kate must remember to thank the Daughter of the Dragon for her concision. And glasses,\u0027 Kate said. And freckles.\u0027 Nolan peered at her and didn\u0027t see a problem. Which ought to be cheering. The snapper spent his days peering through viewfinders at Jean Shrimpton and Penelope Tree. If he saw nothing wrong with specs, frecks and ginger, it was one in the eye for all those lads in cricket caps who made droll remarks about pillar-boxes and owls when not asking her to dance in 1886. They were mostly dead, of course. He picked up a camera and started snapping at her. \u0027Lovely,\u0027 he said. \u0027More fang, please. And the eyes. Flash \u0027em, luv. Teeth and smiles. That\u0027s the business, darling. Oh yes.\u0027 Flashbulbs popped. She was backed against a sheet of butchers\u0027 paper, which fell down. The photographer advanced on her. Click click click. Edwina also had a camera - the Polaroid, which spat out instant images. She showed one to Nolan, who took a photograph of her holding it out to him. Kate saw Edwina\u0027s photograph. There she was, in it. A pale, round face. The blank circles of her specs. Prominent eyeteeth, a defensive snarl. Even her hair. The magic had worked. Despite herself, she was interested. Annoyingly, she looked startled in the picture. Like every long exposure taken when she was alive and had to sit in a chair with head-pincers to be photographed. Bellaver failed to stifle laughter. Griffin was smirking too. She\u0027d make them pay later. \u0027Now, stop all this,\u0027 she said. \u0027We\u0027re here about something serious.\u0027 To Thomas Nolan, this was serious. He shot more pictures, with various cameras, fixed on tripods and hand-held. She tried to exert her will on his. It wasn\u0027t one of her talents, but she\u0027d been a vampire long enough to pick up some of the tricks. Nothing. Each snap was something taken from her. A layer of skin? It was like being bitten, being drained - which she\u0027d only gone through once, albeit profoundly - being turned. She was worried she would fade. Like ice in the sun, I melt away... Edwina and Lin Tang stood to one side, attendant harpies. Why didn\u0027t he photograph them instead? They were pretty. A big lens was close to her face, like the probe of the Martian War Machine in the film of War of the Worlds. She had no reflection in it. The shutter irised inside the camera. Click click click. She shrank, cringing, almost in terror. Nolan went down on his knees, over her, aiming down, still shooting. She put a hand behind her, and felt the floor. She was strong. She could throw him off. She was thirsty. She could bite him. Click click damnable click. She didn\u0027t resist. The clicks were kisses now. Her teeth cut her own lips. Her mouth would be reddened. \u0027Stop,\u0027 she said, firmly. Nolan gripped her thighs with his knees. He bore down on her, a cyclops. The upper half of his face, above his cherub lips, was all camera, a big eye on an extending stalk. There was an automatic quality to his clicking. He took a shot and rolled the film on, again and again. She was wrung out, limp. She saw what was wrong. \u0027Bellaver,\u0027 she said. \u0027Get him off me. It\u0027s about the case.\u0027 As the Super stepped forward, Kate reached up and took away Nolan\u0027s camera. He still made click-and-roll motions. He cooed at her, trying to capture the look. He was in a daze, imagining himself taking photographs. \u0027Luv,\u0027 he said, \u0027come on, luv...\u0027 Griffin and Bellaver helped him stand up. His hands still made motions. He wasn\u0027t seeing anything. His studio girls showed little concern. They were used to not questioning bizarre behaviour. \u0027Lin Tang,\u0027 she said. \u0027He\u0027s been fascinated. Barbarushka?\u0027 The Daughter snorted contempt. \u0027Not that one.\u0027 \u0027Another vampire, then. Recently. How long has he been like this? Manic, not all here...\u0027 The question didn\u0027t mean anything to Lin Tang. \u0027Good news and bad news, Super,\u0027 she told Bellaver. \u0027Nolan must know - must have known - something. But a vampire has got into his head and locked it up.\u0027 The photographer was quieter now, suggestible. Edwina sat him in an egg-shaped chair that hung from the ceiling on a chain. His feet dangled, scraping the floor. He muttered, and his hands worked an invisible camera. \u0027Were either of you with Nolan last night?\u0027 Bellaver asked. \u0027On a boat, and then somewhere else?\u0027 Lin Tang nodded. Edwina shrugged. \u0027Did he take any photographs last night?\u0027 Kate asked. \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Lin Tang. \u0027He always takes photographs.\u0027 \u0027Have they been developed?\u0027 \u0027No. He does that himself.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll need the film,\u0027 said Bellaver. \u0027That won\u0027t be possible,\u0027 said Lin Tang. \u0027Make it possible, Lotus Blossom. Or we\u0027ll find something to charge you with. Obstruction, most likely. If Insidious Fiendishness isn\u0027t an actual offence, we\u0027ll make it up specially.\u0027 \u0027My name isn\u0027t Lotus Blossom, Inspector Plodder. Or Suzie Wong.\u0027 \u0027I did make it clear this is a murder enquiry.\u0027 Lin Tang was unimpressed. Given who the woman was, Kate understood why. A murder? Only one? \u0027Nolan will need help,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027To fix his head. You\u0027d best cooperate.\u0027 \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Lin Tang. \u0027But I will develop the film myself. One of you may join me in the darkroom.\u0027 \u0027An offer you don\u0027t hear every day,\u0027 said Bellaver. \u0027Katie, I\u0027m assuming you can see in the dark.\u0027 \u0027Like a cat,\u0027 she said. \u0027Miaow away, then. I\u0027ll find someone to unscramble Tommy Sunshine\u0027s brains.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-41.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) Rome. 1959.
