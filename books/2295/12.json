{"id":93137,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"DEAD SOULS More people were in Piazza di Trevi tonight. It wasn\u0027t yet midnight. Couples - other couples, Kate corrected herself - looked at the fountain, tossed in coins, made wishes. There was a policeman on guard. \u0027The little girl was standing there,\u0027 Kate said, pointing across the piazza. \u0027Where that woman is.\u0027 Marcello tried to brush her hand down, but came up against her vampire strength of wrist. \u0027Be careful, Signorina Reed...\u0027 \u0027Kate,\u0027 she insisted. \u0027Kate. It does not do to attract attention. Especially with such creatures.\u0027 The woman sat alone on the rim of the fountain, sucking at a cigarette, legs dangling like a kid\u0027s. Her tiny face reminded Kate of the little girl\u0027s, her blonde hair was cropped short. She wore a ratty fur cardigan, a sweater with horizontal stripes, and a tight, short skirt. By gesture and ellipsis, Marcello tried to imply wordlessly that this woman was a prostitute. \u0027Marcello, don\u0027t be silly. Do you think I don\u0027t know a tart when I see one?\u0027 On the whole, Kate got on well with prostitutes. She\u0027d interviewed dozens, dating back to the Whitechapel of Jack the Ripper. Sometimes, when animals weren\u0027t enough, she had bought their blood. Just now, she didn\u0027t want to think about that. She concentrated on Marcello. He was annoyed. The little whore noticed them. She stubbed out her ciggy and dutifully sashayed over, calculatedly manufacturing a smile that didn\u0027t go with the puppyish openness of her big eyes. She was warm, with extensive scabbing around her neckline. Her pallor suggested she made herself available to too many vampires. \u0027Ciao,\u0027 she squeaked. \u0027I am Cabiria. It means \"born from fire\".\u0027 She spoke accented English. Cabiria was the name of the heroine of an Italian film spectacle Kate had seen before the First World War. Obviously, its memory lingered. Since then, Italy had produced fire enough to birth many heroines. Marcello tried to shoo off the whore, but Kate shushed him. \u0027Do you come here often?\u0027 she asked. Cabiria was astonished by the question. Kate laughed. \u0027I\u0027m sorry. I really mean that. Are you often in Piazza di Trevi?\u0027 \u0027Sometimes,\u0027 Cabiria said. \u0027It is good place. Many tourists come here. Nice men, generous. How you say, big spenders?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m after a little girl. Ragazza. I saw her here.\u0027 The whore looked shocked and drew away. Kate realised Cabiria thought her a bloodthirsty child molester. Sometimes being a vampire gave the wrong impression. \u0027I think I can help you not.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Kate, touching the woman\u0027s arm. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean it like that. She was lost, I think. I want to talk with her. She saw something. You\u0027ve heard of the murders, of the Crimson Executioner?\u0027 Cabiria crossed herself and spat. Kate had thought the whore little more than a girl. She was tiny and frail. Her face was unlined and open, almost clownish. But she must have been in her thirties. She was frayed a bit, like her clothes. Kate guessed she\u0027d often been bruised. \u0027Perhaps you should see fortune-teller,\u0027 Cabiria suggested. Marcello snorted. He was trying to move off, to pull Kate away. Kate held still. She was interested. \u0027I can take you. It is not far. Near my home.\u0027 \u0027We have a car,\u0027 Kate said. Marcello was coldly angry. He didn\u0027t want a whore in his car, the precious red Ferrari (which wasn\u0027t actually his - Penny let him have the use of it for reasons Kate couldn\u0027t understand and was worried about). That decided Kate. The Italian must learn his lesson. \u0027Signora Santona is the great fortune-teller of my district.\u0027 \u0027Where do you live?\u0027 \u0027I Cessati Spiriti,\u0027 Cabiria said. Dead Souls. Kate sensed Marcello\u0027s rush of fear. \u0027It is impossible,\u0027 he said. \u0027Kate, you do not know what such a place is like.\u0027 For most of her life, men had been telling Kate things were impossible, that places were terrible and off-limits. They usually meant that poor people lived there. Or there were shameful circumstances it would be distressing to read about in the papers. If Marcello had known her better, he\u0027d have understood that telling her a place was impossible was the best way of making her want to go there. \u0027I\u0027ve been in bad places, Marcello,\u0027 she said. \u0027Worse than you can imagine.\u0027 \u0027Perhaps. But you have never been in I Cessati Spiriti.\u0027 \u0027It sounds fabulous.\u0027 \u0027It is not so bad,\u0027 Cabiria said. \u0027The dead there are not swift like you, vampiro. They are morti viventi, slow. You have to watch over your shoulder.\u0027 Kate led them to the sports car. Cabiria was struck with wonder at the machine, and treated it with the reverence due a religious object. \u0027Ferrari,\u0027 she repeated, over and over, eyes brimful, relishing the \u0027r\u0027-sounds, stroking the mirror-finish of the body. It was a nice car, but Kate couldn\u0027t see what the fuss was about. Getting three of them into the two-seater was a squeeze, but Kate and Cabiria were smaller than average. Cabiria put on a cloche hat. Kate feared a little for her Dior. Marcello let off the brakes and freed the beast under the bonnet. For the first time since Kate had met him, he smiled genuinely rather than to punctuate boredom with politeness. At the wheel, he was a little boy with a new toy, going \u0027broom broom\u0027 under his breath as he drove the Ferrari through the narrow streets at inadvisable speeds. On the drive across the city, Cabiria told her a little about I Cessati Spiriti, with Marcello adding ominous footnotes. Then a site of fighting between the partisans and the Germans, the once-prosperous district was bombed heavily by the Allies. A famous priest had been executed by the Nazis when Rome was an open city, prompting a minor uprising. After the war, I Cessati Spiriti became a shanty-town, home to the dispossessed, a dozen varieties of refugee, many who wished to avoid the peacetime authorities, and the traditional poor. The unplanned community expanded and collapsed in on itself many times. Ten years ago, the De Gaspero government initiated a massive public works programme to clear the slums and rebuild I Cessati Spiriti, but the funds allocated were diverted to the mafia. Much of the building work that got done was so shoddy it fell down at once. The population of the district still swelled, flooded by escapees from the drought-ridden South. With them came a new bloodline. An epidemic cluster of the risen dead, brains burned out by fever, prompted much of the warm population to evacuate. A hardy minority stayed behind in the ruins, learning to live alongside shambling morti viventi. Cabiria had lived here ever since the War. She seemed quite fond of the place. Marcello, it turned out, had never been here. As it slid over trackless wasteland, cruising between huddles of patchwork shacks and piles of festering rubbish, the Ferrari must have looked like a spaceship. Kate was reminded of the trenches of France during the German onslaught of 1918. Open fires burned on the wastes like tribal beacons. Nearby, a knot of morti viventi was encircled by warm feral children who tormented them with flaming torches. From a distance, the walking dead seemed like crippled tramps, easily bested by the fast, vicious kids. One creature got too close to fire and went up like a screeching roman candle. It fell in flames, and two youths battered its head with crowbars. Cabiria directed them to a street lined by the hulks of bombed-out and patched-up buildings. There were no streetlamps but braziers burned, casting flamelight on bullet-pocked walls. It was hard to believe this was in the same city as Via Veneto, but it was hard to believe Whitechapel was in the same city as Kensington. It annoyed her that so much of the world was still like I Cessati Spiriti when it didn\u0027t have to be. \u0027I live there,\u0027 ventured Cabiria, pointing to a shattered apartment block, obviously hoping one or other of them would suggest dropping by for a \u0027visit\u0027. Kate intended to pay the whore for her troubles but didn\u0027t want to take advantage of her services. \u0027And Signora Santona lives here.\u0027 Marcello parked by another ramshackle building. It had once been a church. The roof was gone, replaced with polythene sheets. Some windows had patches of stained glass between the beaten tin cans and taped-in cardboard. \u0027I shall stay with the car,\u0027 Marcello announced. Kate couldn\u0027t argue that wasn\u0027t a sensible idea. Perhaps he\u0027d be attacked by monsters and she\u0027d have to rescue him. That might impress him. Then again, he might blame her for getting him into an attackable situation in the first place. Men were always unreasonable. Marcello sat in the car, angling the wing mirror so he could look in as many directions as possible. Kate and Cabiria got out. Standing on the pavement for a moment, Cabiria listened to the wind. There were faint cries. She shook her head and ventured on. The front door of the former church was boarded up, but a little door at the side led to a staircase that went down into the basements. \u0027It is all underground,\u0027 she said. \u0027Watch your shoes.\u0027 At the bottom of the staircase was a long, wide corridor. The only light came from an oil lamp somewhere. An inch of stagnant water lay on top of a furry carpet. Rough planks propped on bricks made a walkway, with tributary planks leading into rooms. Nailed-up blankets hung from lintels, edges trailing in the water. Business was being transacted in some of the rooms. A scratchy gramophone record was slowing down. A waltz ground to a halt. Cabiria balanced like a tightrope walker on the planks, arms out. Kate, wearing heels, tottered a little as she followed. From one room came a growling and chewing. Behind the thin blanket burned a fire that made a fine crosshatch of the weave. Something spurted and splattered against the blanket, and dribbled down. There were swirls of red in the water. Cabiria pulled Kate on, past that room. \u0027Here is the signora\u0027s apartment,\u0027 she said. This doorway had an actual door. It was bright blue, with gold crescents and silver stars. Cabiria knocked on the door and a hole opened in the centre of a painted eye. \u0027To see the fortune-teller,\u0027 Cabiria explained. The door was opened and the women allowed in. The fortune-teller\u0027s servant was morti viventi, the first Kate had seen up close. A cage-muzzle was nailed to his cheekbones, over the constantly grinding jaw. Facemeat was flaking away. Staring eyes betokened no intellect. Kate understood this was a breed of vampire, given to chewing blood out of flesh rather than drinking from the vein. Most people thought of them as zombies. Maybe classing someone as a reanimated automaton, entirely vacated by its former personality, was an excuse not to treat them as human. On this brief acquaintance, she wasn\u0027t ready to argue the assumption. The servant was dressed in shabby genteel style, a good suit gone to the bad. He had no shoes or socks. His feet were black and ragged. He didn\u0027t try to eat Kate or Cabiria, but led them into a labyrinth. The fortune-teller\u0027s apartment was large, and full of items perhaps accepted in payment. Stacks of furniture, bundles of books, a pile of broken bicycles, jars of specimens floating in brine, several bedsteads, a surprising amount of scientific equipment, empty gilt picture frames, a rack of rifles. Off in curtained rooms, morti viventi performed chores Kate didn\u0027t understand. Santona sat cross-legged on a canopied palanquin, her barrel-body swaddled in many-coloured shawls, neck and wrists heavy with jewellery. She was an old woman, though her face was unlined and her oiled ringlets were youthfully dark. Two more morti viventi attended the fortune-teller. \u0027They were \u0027ndrangheta,\u0027 Santona explained. \u0027From Calabria. Criminals. They tried to move North, but brought this taint with them. Most don\u0027t last long, but I have trained these and make use of them.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m Katharine Reed. From Ireland.\u0027 She extended her hand, but Santona didn\u0027t shake it. \u0027I know,\u0027 she said. \u0027You are in this city for the dying.\u0027 Cabiria crossed herself. \u0027That\u0027s as may be,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027Just now, I\u0027m looking for a little girl I saw in Piazza di Trevi. A witness to a crime.\u0027 \u0027The man in the red hood. He is like these \u0027ndrangheta, only a servant. A tool. There was no little girl.\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t imagine her.\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t see her. You saw a reflection.\u0027 The fortune-teller must have been skimming her mind. Some warm wise women had a little of that vampire sense. \u0027Reflections can mislead.\u0027 Kate had thought that. Something still bothered her about the scene. Had she misunderstood what she saw? \u0027Was she a dwarf?\u0027 she asked. The ripples in the water could have made a child\u0027s face of a withered mask of age. Santona laughed and shook her head. She held out a hand. Kate produced five hundred lire, which disappeared. The fortuneteller had snatched it. \u0027Not everything can be revealed.\u0027 This was what she expected from a proper con woman. Pointless mystification and disappearing money. \u0027You shouldn\u0027t look for this girl. She will find you.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s looking for me?\u0027 \u0027You have shared something.\u0027 Kate shuddered. \u0027You have troubled the Mother. This is important.\u0027 \u0027The girl\u0027s mother?\u0027 Santona shook her head, insistently. \u0027No, Rome\u0027s. Mater Lachrymarum. She has always been here, under and around us.\u0027 \u0027The Mother of Tears?\u0027 Kate remembered her Latin. The \u0027ndrangheta were disturbed. Red-orange trickles slipped through their muzzles onto much-stained lapels. \u0027There are tears everywhere,\u0027 the fortune-teller said. \u0027The stones of the city pour forth tears.\u0027 \u0027What does that mean?\u0027 \u0027Enough. This is all. You have been warned.\u0027 More money was required to end the interview. Kate handed it over. She wondered if Cabiria would get a cut. Santona shut her eyes and lay back on cushions. One of the \u0027ndrangheta massaged her forehead, pickled fingers working away at her temples. Cabiria tugged Kate\u0027s arm. They were required to leave. A small crowd of the walking dead had gathered around the Ferrari. Marcello kept them back with pages of Osservatore Romano, rolled into torches and set alight. When one burned down, he\u0027d shoo the ash away from the car and light another. Morti viventi had stumbled out of their holes. These weren\u0027t under Santona\u0027s spell or muzzled. Some were red-mouthed, others hollowchested and hungry. Many were feeble and fell apart with a kick, but some had prospered, perhaps through cunning, and retained strength in their limbs and jaws. They were dangerous. Marcello was relieved to see her. \u0027They took a little boy last night,\u0027 Cabiria said. \u0027An orphan. He said his father was an American. He was fast but he got tired. They ate his stomach out.\u0027 Kate wondered why Cabiria was telling her this. \u0027He has risen tonight. That is him. Dondi.\u0027 Among the morti viventi was a child in baggy shorts, with an oversized American soldier\u0027s cap. As if he\u0027d heard his name, he turned to look. Olive eyes glittered, but only with wetness. His t-shirt was torn away from his scooped-out belly, and his mouth was chewing. \u0027They first try to eat themselves,\u0027 Cabiria said. Kate felt sick. As she walked through the loose crowd, morti viventi backed away from her. Whatever they craved didn\u0027t run in her veins. A woman-creature sniffed at Cabiria, who squealed. Kate took the morta viventa by the chin, which detached with a snap. A long dog-tongue dangled. Embarrassed at what she had done, Kate gave her back her jawbone. Nothing could be done for these revenants. Were they indeed dead souls, all reason and person fled from reanimated carcasses? Or should she feel pity for the spark that might be left behind? Perhaps, in the end, all undead became like this. Was she the same person she\u0027d been when alive? Or did she just mislead herself that she was? Had Katharine Reed flown off to Heaven or elsewhere, leaving behind a shell that could deceive itself into pretending to live out her life? No. She looked into the empty angel eyes of the newly risen Dondi and knew she was different from him. Kate still felt, still fought. If there was a kinship, it was more tragic. The morti viventi might have a distant awareness of their situation. Kate was weak-kneed with useless love, empathy with something that felt only hunger and pain. \u0027You can kill them easily,\u0027 Marcello said. \u0027Smash their heads. If their brains are broken, they stop moving.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s not the same as being dead.\u0027 He shrugged and lit up the sports pages. \u0027Please,\u0027 said Cabiria. \u0027He was my friend. When I was ill, he... he stole for me.\u0027 \u0027She wants you to kill it,\u0027 Marcello said. \u0027Like a sick dog. To be put out of his misery.\u0027 Kate was crying. She hoped her tears were not bloody. Cabiria hugged Dondi, who was only just shorter than her, and tried to cradle his head. He opened his mouth wide, to bite into her tiny breast. Kate took him away from Cabiria and twisted his head around. The spine snapped, but it wasn\u0027t enough. Head on back-to-front, Dondi crawled toward them, jaws working like mandibles. He was drawn to living flesh, like a bee to pollen. His brain was purged of all that made him human, but there were still instincts. Sobbing now, Kate found a stone and battered the dead boy\u0027s head to paste. The body twitched, but ran down. Whatever had remained seeped away. It took her a moment to compose herself. \u0027We must go, Cabiria,\u0027 Kate said. \u0027Will you be safe?\u0027 Cabiria smiled a one-sided smile and hitched up her shoulders, pulling her cardigan around her thin body. \u0027It\u0027s not far from here,\u0027 she said. \u0027My place.\u0027 Kate gave her more money than was sensible. Cabiria looked at it sadly. \u0027Make me like you,\u0027 she asked. \u0027When I turn, I don\u0027t want to be a zombie. I want still to feel. To be Cabiria, not a woman-shaped dog. Not to be Dondi.\u0027 Kate bit her lip. \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 she said. What was she saving herself for? She\u0027d found virginity a ridiculous \u0027inconvenience\u0027, and had lost hers twice (when she turned, her hymen had grown back again). She\u0027d drunk the blood of children, had killed when she\u0027d had to (and perhaps when she hadn\u0027t), had loved many. Why had she not given the Dark Kiss? Why had she not turned any children-in-darkness? She would have given Charles her blood, had offered to open her veins for him. Why not this warm orphan? It wasn\u0027t a curse. It was an opportunity. She wasn\u0027t lost to God. She wasn\u0027t lost to herself. It wasn\u0027t death, it was life. It would be simple. But she couldn\u0027t. And she couldn\u0027t explain. Cabiria smiled sadly again and rubbed her fur collar against her bites. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027 \u0027Ciao, Cabiria.\u0027 \u0027Goodbye, Kate.\u0027 Kate kissed Cabiria and got back into the Ferrari. Marcello drove away. Kate didn\u0027t want to look back at the bowed figure trudging away from the morti viventi, searching for the warmth of a fire. She didn\u0027t want to, but she did.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dracula-cha-cha-cha-anno-dracula-3/page-12.html","bookId":2295,"book":{"id":2295,"title":"Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3)","description":"Storyline: Anno Dracula: Dracula Cha Cha Cha (Anno Dracula #3) Rome. 1959.
