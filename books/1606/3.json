I don’t even know what we’re doing. We have no real plan. All we have is the need for vengeance mixed with hatred.” It’s a line from a book I read a long time ago. A line I never thought made sense in the world. I never got vengeance before, I always took the coward’s path. He splashes me, “You have got to stop reading so much, it makes you sound like you give a shit.” I feign a hurt look, “I do.” He swims in a circle around me, “I know you do, but no one is going to believe the mean-ass look on your face if you’re spouting some romantic-sounding crap at them.” A laugh slips from my lips before I could stop it. I lay on my back and watch the sky start to darken. “Where did you go with that bloody knife anyway? Did you kill someone?” “Yup,” I chuckle and look up as the water covers my ears, making my voice sound funny in my head, “I went hunting. I love late-in-the-day hunting. The deer are lethargic and tired from the heat. Everyone always wants to do the morning hunt but the deer are like us. They wake up refreshed and ready for the day.” I don’t look to see if he’s listening or caring. He isn’t ever going to hunt. It’s just something my dad once told me. He always did a night hunt. After a long time of no talking, I look at him, “Tell me something you remember.” He floats closer, “I remember I had a game, I was supposed to build something or maybe tear down buildings. Me and Will could play together on our iPods. He liked to pretend he didn’t play when older people were there, but if it was just me and him, he was hounding me. I remember summer watermelon, so juicy it ran down my face when we were eating it. Dad said they used to have seeds. Big ones too. He said that when he was little, he believed if he swallowed the seeds they’d make a tree and he would die as it grew. I remember songs on the radio. Mom would turn it loud and we’d sing at the top of our lungs. I remember there was a girl named Becky in my class who made my stomach hurt the way you do.” My eyes are watering. I don’t look at him. I just whisper, “I remember sitting in the cabin and wondering if I was all alone. If the whole world had died and left me behind. I remember seeing my first infected. I had run and scrambled up a tree. I sat up there for so long and he wouldn’t leave. A man came and he shot the infected, but I still wouldn’t leave the tree. I peed my pants sitting in that tree. I stayed until I was sure he was gone… but he wasn’t. He chased me but I was faster. That was the first time I discovered that just because it feels safe, doesn’t mean it is.” His hand covers mine and we just float in the silence of the darkening sky. “You won\u0027t ever forgive him, will you?” I shake my head, “No. Not the way he needs me to.” “He loves you.” I nod, “I know.” I look over at him and tread water, “I never imagined any of this was possible. It’s better than I hoped for. It’s better than I deserve. But it’s also too short to waste on not ever knowing if he’s lying to me again.” He splashes water at me, “Don’t be so mean.” I grin, “I was raised by wolves, what do you expect?” He laughs and I feel like everything is going to be okay again. I never should have let my attraction to them become something more than my friendship with them. The sky starts to darken more and when I look up, I see Anna and Bernie walking down the path. My inner alarm sounds off but I have to stop it. I know he’s a good guy. I know he would never hurt her. He’s not like the rest of them. Anna strips to her bra and underwear and dives in. I look at the disgusted look on Jake’s face and smile. Bernie waves at us, “Hey guys.” I wave but Jake doesn’t. He looks annoyed. “What’s your problem with Bernie?” I mutter softly. He looks back at me, “He likes Anna.” I nod, “I know, but when I told him she was seventeen, he seemed upset by it. He doesn’t want anything to happen until she’s older. He is a good guy, genuinely.” His eyes narrowed, “You sure?” I nod, “Yup. It’s Allan we need to keep an eye on. That guy’s a pervert. I’m going to kill him with my bare hands, if I get the chance.” Jake laughs nervously, “You’re so small, and yet, so scary.” I point at him, “Don’t forget it. You’re staying here when we leave.” He reaches for me with one of his bear-paw hands, “Don’t think so.” I try to swim away but he dunks me. I swim away and float on my back as Anna swims up. She whispers, “I see you give Bernie that look again, and I will cut you in your sleep.” I shake my head and whisper back, “I never gave him a look. I like Bernie. I’ll like him even more, when you’re twenty.” Her face grows dark, “Emma, I like him now, and I’m not waiting three years to be happy. I know what I want and I could die tomorrow. It’s my life.” I swim closer, “You do anything with him now and I will kill him.” She leans in, almost growling with her whisper, “I’ll kill you first.” I laugh ‘cause she is the only person in the world who I consider a match, “Don’t push me, I have Jake and Will on my side.” She bats her eyelashes, “Don’t bet on it.” I know they both kowtow to her with that sweet face and nasty whisper. She swims to Jake. I see his face darken at whatever she’s saying. She looks like she’s crying and he stops looking angry. She bats those lashes and whispers, and he softens completely back to friendly Jake. “Cheating little brat,” I whisper, watching the display. Jake wraps an arm around her as Bernie slips into the water. He paddles over to me like he might not actually know how to swim, “Wow, this is really cold still. How’s it so cold still?” I shake my head and try not to look like I might murder him any second, “Snowmelt from up the mountain maybe?” Before I can ask him more questions, the teenagers come. They’re between Anna’s and my age and rowdy as hell. They dive in, pushing and shoving and joking. Bernie sighs. I share his sentiment. The calm water becomes choppy as they hoot and holler. “Hey, it’s you.” One of them sees me and swims over. “I dunked you last time, remember? Mark.” He’s closer to my age and has a scar along the side of his face. I nod, “Hi.” He treads water near me, “You really that girl who everyone says is a monster?” “Yeah.” He grins, “You don’t look like a monster to me.” A female voice interrupts us, “You haven’t seen her take down a whole breeder farm single handedly.” I turn to see a girl my age. She beams as she continues, “She saved my ass. Dragged me from the pool as the roof was collapsing on us.” I shake my head, “It wasn’t collapsing. We had time to get out.” Her bright eyes flash, “No, it was unsteady.” She turns to Mark again, “Then she ran us through a field with a wolf, and he attacked whatever was left, after she used two handguns and shot everything that moved.” I roll my eyes, “I wasn’t alone.” Mark laughs, “You are badass. No wonder the old people are scared of you. I heard they have a name for you in the towns. Some kind of bird or something.” I sigh, “I did what anyone would have done and I wasn’t alone. There was a whole team of people and Leo is like five men.” The girl nodded, “Yeah, that sexy guy, Will was there. Him and Mitch, the sniper guy. Hey, if you know Will and Mitch can you introduce me?” Mark shoved her, “What am I—chopped liver? I got something I can introduce you to.” I’m sure I look stunned, “I gotta go.” I swim to the rock and climb out. I don’t know which clothes are mine. There are piles of them. The fading light of the day makes it hard to see. I look back at the huge group of kids, people I consider kids but are my age, and shake my head. “What the hell is wrong with them?” Anna whispers to me, “They act like the world never ended. It’s like the Sweet Valley high books I read at the cabin. I expect these idiots to drive away in one of those cars with no roof and go shopping at a mall.” She sighs, “We need to come earlier so we can swim without them.” I look at her, “I won\u0027t touch Bernie. You’re already at least ten-years older than these people. They have no clue what’s out there in the world. I can’t even imagine you dating a guy like that.” She looks at them and shakes her head, “They never leave this group. They stay and make a life and that’s it. They’ve been with them since the beginning.” I nod, “What if this group doesn’t last forever; none of them has a clue. They’re like the grasshopper who played all summer.” She gives me a confused look and pulls on her shirt and passes me mine. Bernie climbs out, “We’ll have to come earlier tomorrow to avoid that.” Anna grins at him. Jake doesn’t climb out. He fits in but watches me go. That’s the difference between us. He is a grasshopper too. I’m the ant who would save him, no matter what the circumstances. I leave for the tent, holding my clothes, knife, bow, quiver, and boots. The warm, night air is considerably-less intense than the last time I was here. I walk up the path alone and distracted. At the top, a pair of yellow eyes meet me on the trail. I grin when I see them, but they don’t lose any of their worry and annoyance in the dim light. I put a hand down, “I knew you’d come.” Seeing him gives me a bad feeling. He’s here for something and it makes me think about my dream. He makes a sound and walks over to nudge me. I run my fingers through his fur and hold his face up, “You okay? What about Meg and Sarah, they okay?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-3.html","bookId":1606,"book":{"id":1606,"title":"Reborn (Born #3)","description":"Storyline: Reborn (Born #3) Twenty years ago a man made a child he never intended to love.
