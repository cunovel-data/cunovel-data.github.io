The guard who let the four of us in, didn’t record us. He only recorded when I came in alone two days ago, after I went and took Star and everyone home.\" It seems too perfect. It feels like it breaks one of my rules. I shake my head, \"We need to get out of here. It\u0027s too convenient. We need to go. Me and Anna will stay up here. You go find the address for Marshall\u0027s and then we all leave.\" He shakes his head, \"I can get it in the apartment. I have a computer that is linked, I work from home a lot.\" He walks to the door, but I have the feeling in my guts that I have learned to trust, \"Wait.\" He looks back, \"What?\" He\u0027s getting annoyed. I point, not really at him, but not away from him either, \"If you brought Will in twice now, saved Anna once, and brought me in a few times, then you\u0027re linked to us. I bet you are being watched. Why would they trust you?\" His eyes look scary for the first time ever. He bites his lip, \"Trust me, they just do.\" I shake my head, \"I want answers. This is too easy.\" Anna looks confused. He looks at her and then down, \"This place wouldn’t be possible without me. I knew exactly what they had planned from the start. I was young and stupid, and the idea made sense. I helped them make this place. The scientific proof was there. The UN was right, we were making the world sick. We were the problem. I was nineteen and it all made sense. The first paper I ever wrote in university was based on the UN\u0027s belief that the five-percent plan was the only way to save the world. Only I didn’t stop there, I went on to help plan exactly how it would be implemented, ensuring only the best of the best survived to help weed out the imperfections. I was fourteen at the time. I went to university early.\" I take a step back from him, \"Bernie.\" Anna looks like she might get sick. He nods, \"I\u0027m not proud. They recruited me when I was turning nineteen. I had a double doctorate. I didn’t know that some of my teachers were members of the special committee formed by the UN to plan this out.\" He sighs, \"I saw the Georgia Guidestones as a kid. I saw them and I believed that they were correct. The science was there. So when they explained what was about to happen, I believed.\" I give Anna a look and then him, \"What\u0027s a guidestone?\" She shakes her head, but he gets a gleam in his eye. \"In the seventies, a man using an alias commissioned a monument in Elbert County, Georgia. The monument was made of granite and stood almost twenty feet high. It\u0027s got an inscription on it that’s translated into eight modern languages and four ancient ones. The inscription is ten principles or guides to a successful future.\" I sit down on the ledge of the roof, \"This is about to get creepy, isn’t it?\" He nods, \"It is. Rule one, maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. Rule two, guide reproduction wisely—improving fitness and diversity. Rule three, unite humanity with a living new language. Rule four, rule passion—faith—tradition—and all things with tempered reason. Rule five, protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts. Rule six, let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court. Rule seven, avoid petty laws and useless officials. Rule eight, balance personal rights with social duties. Rule nine, prize truth—beauty—love—seeking harmony with the infinite. Rule ten, be not a cancer on the earth—leave room for nature—leave room for nature.\" Anna whispers, \"You repeated the last part.\" He nods, \"Yup. That’s exactly as it\u0027s stated on the guidestones. So the plan was implemented, all nations would adhere to this but keep their countries pure to whatever they were initially. Blacks were sent to Africa, South Americans to South America, Chinese to China, and so forth.\" I point at his face, \"There were Americans and Canadians who were born here and white people who were born in Europe, how did you sort that out?\" He shakes his head, \"We didn’t—are you kidding? We lost total control. The infection was based on something that could be cured and prevented in the right people, genetically-superior people. It didn\u0027t work. It mutated. We had to build the city, try to keep the people we were breeding alive, and Michael was slowly getting crazier and crazier.\" I wave my hand, \"I don’t want to know. I change my mind; I don’t want to know.\" He sighs and gives Anna a defeated look, \"I\u0027m sorry. You now that’s not how I think now, right?\" She shrugs and looks down. I can see the fury on her and she\u0027s unstable enough to act out on it. I point to the door, \"Let\u0027s go find Marshall\u0027s plan and end this shit.\" He looks sickened, but not nearly as much as we are. I knew how it worked, essentially, but not to this degree. One language and prizing beauty with truth and love, that’s crazy. Beauty is nothing, compared to truth and love. I walk down the stairs, unsure of Bernie\u0027s true feelings. I know Anna feels the same way I do. I can tell by the way she\u0027s walking close to me and glancing back. He leads us to the door to his place. \"Just give me a second.\" He goes in first, alone, and comes back minutes later, \"I know where Marshall\u0027s is.\" We leave the apartment doorway, and walk to the door to the garage. I hate the garage; it\u0027s still as dark as night in there. I can\u0027t see a thing. Anna stays close to me, \"This place is creepy,\" she whispers. I nod, not that she can see it, \"Yup.\" Bernie\u0027s hand reaches for mine, as we get further into the darkness, \"It\u0027s this way,\" he whispers. I don’t know how he can tell, it\u0027s so black everywhere. Suddenly, light floods the area as he opens a door. It\u0027s a stairwell. He steps in and the lights shift. It\u0027s those annoying lights that only turn on when you walk under them. I point upward as they shift with our steps, \"These were a stupid idea.\" He snorts but continues down the flights of stairs. When we reach the bottom, he grabs Anna and does the first bold thing I have ever seen. He plants his lips on hers, muttering into the kiss, \"I don’t care about any of this. I love you, and if you can\u0027t love me anymore, just kill me.\" In the flickering light, I see they are the same. They don’t take the coward’s path, like I do. She shakes her head, whispering into him. His lips turn up and I can\u0027t stop staring at them both. My heart is so broken, I know I\u0027ll never live through this. My stomach hurts all the time but this makes it worse. I know in the flickering light that I would pick him, every time it would be him. Even if he dies, it will still be him. I open the door and walk past them. I need the fur in my fingertips, and the mean stares from the man I love, to make all of this go away. Hell, even that little, saucy blonde is part of the things I need. What I have though, is a mute psycho and a slightly-crazy genius and no plan whatsoever. Bernie mutters to me as he walks past me, \"Follow me.\" Anna catches up to me, looking slightly more blushed and peaceful. She glances at me sideways but doesn\u0027t say anything. I don’t care. I trust Bernie; even if I don’t want to, I do. We walk in peace until I notice she\u0027s glancing around. I whisper, \"You have to keep your eyes up and look straight ahead—they don’t look around or talk to each other.\" She shakes her head, \"I don’t like it here.\" \"Me either.\" Bernie stops after a while in front of the only building I think doesn’t look like the others. The doorway is old and arched. It looks like it has character and has been weathered in a different way or time than the rest of the other buildings. Bernie swipes the door, opening it for us. \"Is this older than the rest of the city?\" He nods as he closes the door, \"This is the only thing left of Newport, Washington. Safest place in the USA. Close to fresh water, four seasons, no threat of flood or drought, low population, so we could get them out and take over the town with very little concern to the rest of the world, and natural barriers. The coastal mountains held off a lot of the tidal waves and the Rockies prevent anything from coming from the other side. Not too south so as to be too hot, and not too north, to be too cold. The watershed is replaced every year by the snowfall, and yet, it\u0027s dry and warm in the summer for farming. Perfection.\" I look around the old foyer of the building, \"What\u0027s this?\" He grins, \"The old court house. We set up here in the beginning while we were taking over the town.\" I shake my head, \"If only you had put that much effort into saving the world.\" He scoffs, \"We did try, don’t ever let anyone tell you we didn’t try.\" I think I\u0027ve annoyed him. He climbs the stairs to the second floor. We walk down the dark hall in silence. He stops in front of a door but drops to his knees. He gets close to the handle and I hear metal lightly tapping against itself. He opens the door a second later. A smell creeps out into the hallway as the door opens fully. I step back, pulling my gun from the back of my pants. I step softly into the room, smelling and listening but there is nothing. It\u0027s silent as whatever is dead in there. My animal eyes switch on, the room is still. I open the fridge and close it quickly, \"It\u0027s the old food. He hasn’t been here in a while.\" Bernie closes the door, switching on a small light in the living room. We search the cupboards. I want to take the food but I know that’s not why I\u0027m here. I close the cupboard, leaving behind weeks’ worth of perfectly-good food. That bothers me. We search every room methodically. I find a book called The Da Vinci Code and stuff it into my pocket. Anna grins when she sees it. We meet back in the living room and sit on the couches. I glance at Bernie, \"You find anything at all?\" He shakes his head, \"No. Marshall was too smart for that, I guess.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-18.html","bookId":1606,"book":{"id":1606,"title":"Reborn (Born #3)","description":"Storyline: Reborn (Born #3) Twenty years ago a man made a child he never intended to love.
