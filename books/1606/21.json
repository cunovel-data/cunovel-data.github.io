{"id":92747,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\n Bernie walks to the panel, lifting a screen and turning something on. The light from it makes a new brightness in the orange glow and the flashing red lights. I think I might go crazy waiting for the dart gun or the real gun to hit me. I know it\u0027s an ambush; it feels like the one set for me with Marshall.\n Bernie starts typing fast.\n \"Jesus. This thing is legit. It\u0027s old as hell, but it\u0027s legit.\"\n I glance back at him, \"How long?\"\n He shakes his head, \"I just need to break the codes and launch it.\"\n I sigh, \"How long, Bern?\"\n \"Ten minutes, maybe.\"\n I sigh, \"Shit.\" Ten minutes will feel like forever.\n His fingers fly across the clunky keyboard. He wipes away sweat, almost in sync with me. The room feels like a steam bath like the one I went to with Granny. We were staying in a hotel in Vegas once. Granny wanted to go there so bad and Lenny said no, so she waited until he was gone on one of his trips and took me then. Just like she let me use her ereader, got me an Xbox, and let me play on her laptop, she let me be a normal kid when Lenny wasn\u0027t there. Looking at the clunky, old laptop I barely recall how to use it.\n Bernie shakes his head, \"I can\u0027t believe they put this here. I can\u0027t believe I never knew.\"\n \"Why did they?\"\n He shrugs, \"Not a clue. Must be the fail safe, in case the wrong people get control again, or if another country comes to invade, I guess. We did this to every other country, so the threat of them coming for us was never a real one.\"\n I scowl, \"You did what?\"\n He gives me a blank stare, \"We launched HEMP\u0027s over everyone. We killed the power grids in every country but ours.\"\n I shake my head, \"What about the cities? Will said that the other cities were like this one. Every continent had cities, there were ten or something.\"\n He shakes his head too, \"No. We wanted to end world wars and pollution, and we did. We were scared they would launch these over us, so we removed all threats.\"\n I feel weird about the fact he knew they did this to other places, \"Is this something you had planned to maybe do to the United States?\"\n He shakes his head, \"No. I didn’t even know there was a contingency plan in place here. It makes me uncomfortable to know they had one for the breeder farms. It means they have fully lost control of the virus, with no possibility of getting it back.\"\n The talk of the infected, combined with the flashing red lights, makes me considerably more uncomfortable. \"Do you think the newer breeder babies are really immune?\"\n He shakes his head, \"I don’t know what to think. I\u0027m not a virologist. I\u0027m a tech nerd…\"\n A noise cuts him off. We both freeze, except for his fingers. They continue to type. I scan the top of the stairs as I hear another noise.\n \"Bernard? Really?\"\n I know the voice instantly, as the face I barely recall hovers over the railing. \"And you must be Emma. You look so much like her, it\u0027s frightening.\"\n My stomach drops.\n Bernie\u0027s fingers don’t stop but he speaks softly, \"Michael, meet your daughter.\"\n He laughs and shakes his head. He looks nearly identical to my father, but older and more tired. His eyes gleam, \"You\u0027ve been causing me some serious issues.\"\n He starts down the next flight of stairs. I walk up them, glancing back at Bernie, \"Don’t stop.\"\n He nods, wiping more sweat from his brow.\n I take the stairs two at a time. Michael stops walking, pausing and listening, \"Bernard, stop that. You\u0027ll never break the code on that one.\"\n I round the corner to the next flight but stop; he\u0027s there in all his glory. I\u0027ve made him into a huge monster, but I see he\u0027s no larger than any other man I\u0027ve killed with my bare hands.\n He smirks at me, \"You must have so many questions.\"\n I watch his eyes, making certain I can see the plotting behind them. He takes a step towards me. I don’t move but his steps are timid. He\u0027s scared of me. He knows what I\u0027m capable of.\n \"Emma, you were one of the first. We had twenty women come in, six of the babies died. The mothers of the ones who lived got very sick. The babies are too strong of a parasite and the immune systems we gave them were unstoppable. You could inject HIV into a Gen child and they will kill the disease. Your bodies actually destroy cancer cells when they try to form inside of you. I can inject your blood into people and it will fight disease and infection.\"\n I hardly listen to him. I listen for the fingers typing and watch for the movement in his eyes.\n \"You are magnificent. God himself would bow before what I have created.\"\n He puts a hand out for me to take, \"I can show you the others like you. You can teach them how to control what they are and how to manage their moods and tempers. I know you can do it. The ones from the beginning are the special ones. We made the rest from you, from your DNA.\" He starts to laugh maniacally, like a cartoon character. I hear a gunshot and look over the edge at Bernie slumping over the keyboard. A man behind him with a gun pointed at his back looks up at me.\n His eyes are so busy searching mine for the despair I know is there, that he misses the fingers reaching for the keyboard. He misses the determination in Bernie and assumes he\u0027s dead. But I know Bernie. I know his goal in life is to stop this. I only let my peripheral gaze see the hand press the last buttons, almost silently. I deadlock his gaze to mine as Bernie\u0027s fingers flutter over the keyboard. He presses the last buttons and the red flashes become sounds. The man\u0027s gun goes off again, but it doesn’t matter. Whatever Bernie did, it\u0027s done. I look up at Michael\u0027s face. His cocky smile fades. He rushes past me to the basement floor shouting, \"STOP IT!\"\n The man dives for the keyboard but the beeping alarm and the flashing lights don’t end.\n Tears threaten my vision. I see a countdown on the screen. The numbers look like it might be a minute. I break into a run, a sprint. My lungs are screaming for air in the dank room as they mix with a panic attack, and the possibility that I won\u0027t make it. I have a new plan, but I don’t know if it\u0027s enough. I run through the door to the hallway and sprint harder. The door to the far hallway is ajar with a boot. In the dim, orange light, I can see it\u0027s from the dead man on the floor. I snatch his pass and run for the far side of the dank corridor.\n I don’t hear anything but my heartbeat.\n She can\u0027t lose Bernie and Will. I can\u0027t do that to her. I run harder, getting back into the other building. The stairs and the passes can\u0027t go fast enough. My legs burn as I reach the lab where I know Will is.\n I fling open the door and run across the floor. The lights can barely keep up with me but as I near the door to his room, I see the man with the gray beard. He points a gun at me, \"Where is Bernie?\"\n I shake my head, sniffling almost and heaving for air, \"He\u0027s dead. Michael killed him.\" I\u0027m hoping he\u0027s on our side.\n He nods, keeping the gun on me, \"Good news.\"\n I see his finger tense to pull the trigger, but there is a sparking noise and the lights cut out. We stand in the darkness for a second before I see the spark of light from the gun. I\u0027ve moved but he doesn’t know that. He doesn’t know I can move silently. He doesn’t know I can see in the dark better than he can. When my hand grabs his forehead and my knife slices across his throat, he doesn’t know his death is seconds away.\n I hold him tight, waiting for him to move his hands and fire the gun, but he drops to the floor. I feel around in the dark for his gun and take it from his still-warm, gripping hand. For whatever reason, that bothers me. I turn and run for the door. I have to feel in the dark for the handle. The scanner doesn’t work and the door won\u0027t open.\n Frustrated, defeat starts to build but I refuse. The tears have started, but through them I feel for the place where the door clicks shut. I place the barrel of the gun on that spot and angle my body away from it. I fire but the door still won\u0027t open. I kick at it but it won\u0027t open. I drop to my knees, screaming and pounding on it. He\u0027s in there dying alone; the life support has cut off. I cut the power with Bernie and he\u0027s in there without me. He\u0027s dying without me. Bernie is face down in the basement with my screaming father, and I\u0027m stuck in the lab with a dead man and my heart breaking.\n I wipe my face and stand, turning the handle and kicking again. I hear the door make a noise and do it again. It makes another noise. My leg feels like it might break, but I kick once more, snapping something inside of the door. It flies open. I rush in, hands out.\n I can\u0027t feel anything and I\u0027m scared they took him away. The tracer won\u0027t work to find him. They\u0027ve moved him and I\u0027ve lost him.\n \"Will, baby you here? Will?\"\n I trip and fly across the room. My hands land on the edge of the bed as I fall. I grip it, scrambling to my feet and slapping down on him the entire way. His body is there. I think it\u0027s him. I run my hands up his bare chest to the bandage; it\u0027s him. I drag my hands along his face to where the tube is in his nose and the mask is on his face.\n He\u0027s warm but the machines aren’t moving. I pull the mask off slowly, trying not to shake when I move my fingertips. I flip the nose thing out of his nostrils. His face is slack. I kiss his cheek, whispering, \"Baby, don’t leave me. Please, Will. Don’t leave me.\"\n I don’t know, nor care, where Michael is. I don’t know if I will make it out of the city, or if anything is ever going to be okay in this world with nothing. All I need to know is how to save him. I kiss his face again and part his lips. I breathe into his mouth. I remember first air. Mouth to mouth was not as important as chest compressions. I remember that. I feel for his heart and push down but the bed is too soft, it doesn’t compress.\n I cry louder, \"Will, goddammed don’t leave me.\" I breathe into his lips again but nothing happens. I feel his arms for the plastic lines of the I.V. I saw before.\n I need light. I feel around for the counters I saw. When I open a drawer I can\u0027t tell what anything is. I drop to my knees again, pulling more drawers open, but I still don’t recognize anything. Everything I touch is a foreign object. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-21.html","bookId":1606,"book":{"id":1606,"title":"Reborn (Born #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Reborn (Born #3) \n Twenty years ago a man made a child he never intended to love. \n Ten years ago the world ended and Emma turned her back on the man she believed was her father...in an attempt to survive. \n Eight weeks ago she discovered the truth about her family, including the sister she never knew existed. \n Last week she had her heart broken by the one man she never imagined giving it to. \n Yesterday she turned her back on those she cared for in an attempt to help them survive. \n Today she plans on hunting two men to the ends of the broken earth. \n Not to save the world. \n Not to make the world a better place. \n Tomorrow... she plans on getting revenge.(\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reborn-born-3.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:07 PM"}}
