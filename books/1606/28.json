Jake saves me by pointing out the animals in the pens, \"What\u0027s that Andy?\" Andy giggles and takes his hand to show him something called a cheep.\\n\\n Star comes up with a grin and muscles like I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve never seen on a girl. I point, \"What is that?\"\\n\\n She laughs, \"Been learning to be a smithy.\" She wraps her arms around me, hugging me fiercely. She pulls back, \"How\u0027s the farmhouse?\"\\n\\n She means how\u0027s Will, but she won\u0027t ask. I appreciate that. I nod, \"Good. Everyone is good.\" I point behind me, \"I\u0027m going to say hi to Meg.\"\\n\\n She winks, \"Say hi to Bernie while you\u0027re there. It\u0027s his bush too.\"\\n\\n I turn and walk toward the massive rose bush.\\n\\n A man walks up to me, meeting me along the way, \"Emma!\"\\n\\n I smile when I see him, \"Mitch!\"\\n\\n He wraps his arms around me, smelling my hair and shaking his head, \"I heard about Will and Bernie. I\u0027m so sorry.\"\\n\\n I pull back, \"Will\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n His face drops, \"He\u0027s alive?\"\\n\\n I nod.\\n\\n He sighs, \"Oh thank God. I heard he was killed. I nearly died myself.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s at the farmhouse I used to hide at. We built a wheat farm there. Got a lot of the retreat people there for the winters.\"\\n\\n His smile is still sweet. He nudges me, \"You\u0027re taking me with you when you go.\"\\n\\n I shake my head, \"No way. You gotta stay here and help out.\"\\n\\n He rolls his eyes, \"It\u0027s already bigger than it needs to be. Star is figuring out how to make bullets now. She\u0027ll have a factory in no time.\" He stares at her for a second, like he\u0027s getting lost in thought and repressed emotions. When he snaps out of it, he shakes his head, \"No, I need to leave here.\"\\n\\n I understand and nod, \"Alright. We ride out tomorrow. Sully wants me to take two more horses, so you can ride one.\"\\n\\n He nods. Leo comes strolling up, sniffing Mitch. He makes his happy wolf face after a second. Mitch squats to scratch Leo\u0027s face, grinning up at me, \"You know you need my skills anyway.\"\\n\\n I snort, \"It\u0027s sad, but you could be the difference between survival and not. We don’t have a lot of snipers at the farmhouse.\"\\n\\n He winks, \"I hear you got a lot of ladies.\"\\n\\n I fold my arms over my chest, \"We do. You know how to deliver a baby?\"\\n\\n He smiles, standing up, \"I do. I did it once. It was scary as shit, but I can I do it.\"\\n\\n I slap his arm, \"Then you\u0027ll be popular.\"\\n\\n His face blushes a little. He\u0027s normally the strong, silent type; he\u0027s me but a guy. Star strolls over, looking strong and confident, \"You hear the towns have started up law enforcement?\"\\n\\n I frown, \"They always had guards.\"\\n\\n She shakes her head, \"Sheriffs. They started swearing in sheriffs and judges. With no farms and camps, and no city, the towns are becoming real towns. They\u0027re trying to get rid of the corruption.\"\\n\\n I roll my eyes, \"Kind of a day late and a dollar short.\" I read that in one of Granny\u0027s novels. I love that one.\\n\\n She laughs, \"It\u0027s better than nothing. We\u0027ve been thinking since we have ten houses, we might do the same. You guys should too.\"\\n\\n I look at Mitch, \"You wanna be my sheriff?\"\\n\\n He nods once, \"I\u0027d do anything for you, Em.\"\\n\\n The comment makes me uncomfortable, just a little. I pretend it\u0027s nothing and nod, \"Okay.\"\\n\\n Star points at Sully, I barely recognize him. He\u0027s a beast of a man somehow. In the month I\u0027ve been gone, he has gained massive amounts of muscle, like Star, but more bulging. \"He wants you guys to take four horses, one is a stud and not related to any of the females at the farm.\"\\n\\n I nod, \"Okay. Just tell Jake what you want. He\u0027s the horse guy.\"\\n\\n She laughs, \"Who knew he had a purpose, beyond making the view that much better.\"\\n\\n I laugh.\\n\\n She winks, \"Studding horses suits him.\" She walks away and her shorts and tee shirt suddenly suit her. Her body is strong and fit now. She doesn’t giggle and she doesn’t hug people. She slaps them on the arm.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s so different now.\"\\n\\n I glance at Mitch and nod, \"So different.\"\\n\\n He swallows, \"I almost miss the giggly massage girl.\"\\n\\n \"You know that was an act right? That never was who she was. She was trying to blend in, keep information flowing from Marshall and her brother.\"\\n\\n He gives me a smirk, \"I know. I still liked that sweet smile and funny laugh.\"\\n\\n I sigh, \"Men are animals.\"\\n\\n He laughs and walks with me to Jake. Sully\u0027s sees us, his dirty face brightens, \"Emma!\"\\n\\n I wave but he comes over, giving me a bulging, muscled, and sweat-laden hug. My back cracks when he shakes me.\\n\\n He puts me down, \"How\u0027s Will, Anna, and Sarah?\"\\n\\n \"Great. They\u0027re all great. Anna is getting a small belly. It\u0027s like a tiny little hump. And she\u0027s not sick anymore.\"\\n\\n He smiles, \"Cool. Me and Star wanna get some officials around here, so that when the little bambino comes we can come up there.\" He nods behind the barn, \"We\u0027re making a cart into a sled. You all should do the same thing.\"\\n\\n \"Smart. I\u0027ll tell Will.\"\\n\\n His eyes narrow a little, \"How\u0027s he feeling?\"\\n\\n I shake my head, \"He doesn’t say much. You know what he\u0027s like.\"\\n\\n He snorts, \"Yeah, he\u0027s you, but he\u0027s got a dick.\"\\n\\n I frown.\\n\\n He laughs. I don’t see what\u0027s funny about that statement. Sometimes I still get lost in conversations, but I\u0027ve come a long way.\\n\\n Mitch nudges me, \"Emma doesn’t like talking about dicks, she likes killing shit.\"\\n\\n My face is getting red. I glance at Meg\u0027s grave where Leo is sitting alone and point, \"I\u0027m going to say hi to Meg.\" I walk past them and try to not hear their laughing.\\n\\n It takes me a minute to pull the dead branches and leaves off the mound of rocks. Leo sits, looking regal. His eyes always get sad when he\u0027s with her.\\n\\n I kneel beside him and run my hands down his back.\\n\\n I don’t look down into the rock pile though. I look up and smile, \"Hey, Meg.\"\\n\\n I know she\u0027s there. I know very few things, but I know that.\\n\\n After a minute Jake is there beside me. The warmth of his body next to mine is nice.\\n\\n \"Hi, Meg.\"\\n\\n Leo whines a little and lies down. Jake nods his head. I can tell he\u0027s saying something in his head. I reach over, taking his hand in mine. He doesn’t look at me but he squeezes.\\n\\n I hear boots behind us, \"Wanna take a hot shower? I got the power up and running now. The inverter is finally fixed.\"\\n\\n I glance back at Star, \"Seriously?\"\\n\\n She grins.\\n\\n Jake winks at me, \"I\u0027ll race you to the showers.\"\\n\\n I stick my tongue out, \"Just go first. My legs are broken from that damned horse.\"\\n\\n He helps me up, \"No, you go first.\"\\n\\n Star laughs, \"Always the gentleman.\"\\n\\n His eyes burn, \"Not always.\"\\n\\n Chapter Twelve\\n\\n The next day the saddle instantly picks a fight with my butt. I wince and wait for the numb to take over again.\\n\\n Mitch laughs, \"Oh, that was a face. Sore arse, Emma?\"\\n\\n I growl and give him a hard look. He puts his hands up defensively but continues laughing.\\n\\n Jake gives me a shitty grin too. I snarl and nod at Star, \"I\u0027ll send word when the snow hits, and if anything remarkable happens.\"\\n\\n She winks, \"I\u0027ll send word if I find Daddy Dearest.\"\\n\\n I have created a monster. She is more like me daily, like she\u0027s picking up the cold hateful pieces I am losing. I nod, \"Don’t go after him without me.\" I don’t want him to kill her. We may not be close, but she\u0027s all I have left. She\u0027s my blood.\\n\\n She slaps the butt of the horse, \"Have a safe trip.\" My horse leaps into action. I almost cry out. I need to learn to ride horses better. Flopping around in the seat might be the death of me.\\n\\n Sully waves us off at the gate. I can\u0027t make myself trust him. He does everything he can to earn our trust and help us, but to me he was one of them. I have to force myself to see Jack when I look at him. No matter what, I see the picture I made in my head of them eating people. It makes me gag a little.\\n\\n Mitch and Jake pass me, making dust for me to follow. I see movement to the right as we pass the crater. I pull an arrow and make an attempt at the matted, red hair of the monster stumbling along the grass. I loose two arrows but they both miss. Leo looks at me and then sprints off to the side. He snaps her neck and catches up to me. I sigh, I need to learn to shoot from a horse. This is my new goal.\\n\\n We pass the place where Fish and the gang captured us, and I try again on a deer running alongside the destroyed road. I\u0027m going to run out of arrows at this rate. Leo doesn\u0027t even attempt the deer. I think he\u0027s starting to feel sorry for me so he\u0027s pretending to not see my sucky aim.\\n\\n The guard on the platform in the tree is an amazing sight. He waves at us as we ride in. Jake has the extra horse tied to him so he goes directly to the right when we break the forest. The farmhouse and the small village look bigger than before. More people maybe.\\n\\n Will comes out smiling. He looks red, not burnt, but winded. I\u0027m going to smack him around. He grabs my horse\u0027s reigns but smiles at Mitch, \"Hey, man. How\u0027s it going?\"\\n\\n Mitch hops off his horse like we just did a quick jaunt around the yard. He doesn\u0027t look like he might die any second. I can\u0027t get off the horse fast enough, but when I do my legs buckle. Leo is there when I fall. I lean on his huge back, \"Thanks, buddy.\"\\n\\n Mitch and Will are hugging. I can see relief on Mitch\u0027s face. \"I heard you were gone, brother.\"\\n\\n Will glances at me, \"Yeah, I was for a little while.\"\\n\\n Mitch smacks his arm, \"Even the devil didn’t want you, huh?\"\\n\\n Will chuckles, \"Naw.\"\\n\\n Mitch sees Anna, I see the sadness on his face. He nods that way, \"Going to go see how the momma-to-be is doing.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-28.html","bookId":1606,"book":{"id":1606,"title":"Reborn (Born #3)","description":"Storyline: Reborn (Born #3) \\n Twenty years ago a man made a child he never intended to love. \\n Ten years ago the world ended and Emma turned her back on the man she believed was her father...in an attempt to survive. \\n Eight weeks ago she discovered the truth about her family, including the sister she never knew existed. \\n Last week she had her heart broken by the one man she never imagined giving it to. \\n Yesterday she turned her back on those she cared for in an attempt to help them survive. \\n Today she plans on hunting two men to the ends of the broken earth. \\n Not to save the world. \\n Not to make the world a better place. \\n Tomorrow... she plans on getting revenge.(\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reborn-born-3.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:07 PM"}}
