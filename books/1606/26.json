I would have let Marshall take me in, so he could have set the missiles and destroyed everything. You, Bernie, Meg, Jake, Sarah, Will, Star, and Sully would be safe.\"\n She sighs and lays back in the hay, \"Em, you laid with the dead to help me escape. You saved Meg, Me, Sarah, and Jake. You helped Bernie stop the bad people having power over us all. You are the fiery crow, even when you don’t try to be.\"\n I scoff, \"Some fiery crow I turned out to be.\" I glance back at her, \"I think Bernie was the crow. He let the man he used to be die, so he could be a new man for you. A man you could be proud of and tell your baby about.\"\n She smiles and wipes her eyes, \"Thanks, Em.\"\n I shake my head, \"Don’t thank me. I never brought him home.\"\n Leo moves to lay with her. She runs her fingers through his downy fur. \"Why do you think they were rounding up the infected?\"\n I watch the field and listen to the rest of the world, \"I don’t know.\"\n \"I think it\u0027s your dad, I think he\u0027s got an evil plan.\"\n I nod, watching the darkness, \"He always seems to have one.\"\n \"Why didn’t you kill him?\"\n I shake my head, \"I wanted him to see how it really was here. He\u0027s been living in that city with all those Gen babies of his scaring everyone into being under his thumb. He never had an army or anything, beyond the guards. He had all those Gen kids. Everyone was so scared and timid there, they just let him do everything the way he wanted. No one challenged him I bet.\" I look back at her, \"Bernie stopped that and made it so he has to see how we have lived. Think of how last winter was for you. Alone with Jake in the woods, freezing and starving. My dad was in the city, nice and warm and torturing people.\"\n She presses her lips together, \"We hid out in a house and burned the furniture to stay warm. Then the snow was melting and we saw you and this guy here. He came up, growling and acting all mean, but I gave him a piece of rabbit. He ate it and then we became friends.\"\n I nod, \"Little traitor. I figured there was something. There was no way he was just so easy around you from the start.\" I smirk back, \"I\u0027m gad though. For everything that’s gone wrong, the things that went right have changed my life.\"\n She kicks me, \"Gimme my rifle and go see my brother. I think he\u0027s sort of bummed out that you\u0027re hiding up here, instead of with him.\" She rolls her eyes, \"Lord knows he\u0027s gonna come up here if you don’t, and then we\u0027ll all get murdered while you two mess up the watch.\"\n I think for a second and then pass her the rifle. It\u0027s hers anyway.\n She gets into position with Leo, shoving me out of the way.\n \"You should be sleeping, you\u0027re pregnant.\"\n She shrugs, \"I can sleep tomorrow.\" She looks up at the stars and smiles, \"I miss him tonight and I can\u0027t sleep, so I\u0027d rather sit here under the stars and see if I can guess which one is him.\"\n She is killing me.\n I get up and walk down to the house. I creep inside to the room in the back where I know he\u0027s sleeping. I open the door softly and step inside. My stomach is in knots, but I want to touch him.\n I pull off my pants, shirt, and boots, crawling into the bed in my underwear and tank top. He pulls back the covers, \"I was getting hurt feelings.\"\n I laugh as quietly as I can, \"I just don’t think it\u0027s hit me that you\u0027re here. I don’t trust it. Everything else is wrecked—why do I get to be the one who gets lucky and finds the man she loves?\"\n He leans on his arm in the moonlight and grins a shitty smile at me, \"I knew you loved me.\" He reaches out, taking my hand in his. I close my eyes and remember how it felt in the lab room. In the dark I would swear it was him, but now in the dark of this room, I can feel the calluses from picking at a guitar. The hand in the room never had that. He pulls me into his arms, whispering into my cheek, \"Emma, you and me deserve all the luck we can get. If it\u0027s one day’s worth, or it\u0027s two years’ worth, or it\u0027s a whole lifetime, we deserve it. After everything we\u0027ve been through, we deserve every second.\" He kisses against the edge of my lips, \"I love you with my whole heart and I\u0027ll never lie to you again.\"\n I nod into his face, pushing into the kiss and let him pull me under his body.\n When I wake up in the morning, he\u0027s gone but Leo is crashed on the bed with me. He lifts his face, making his wolf smile and yawns.\n I rub his fur and decide we need to stay in this room a little longer. Bad things rarely happen when I\u0027m in bed; it\u0027s mostly when I get up and start the day.\n I give Leo a deep rub down. He rolls onto his back so I get the parts he loves the most. His belly and armpits are his favorite. I scratch and he starts to make his wolf purring noise. Sarah comes in with a plate of food and crawls into the bed with us. I steal some of the pancake on her plate. It\u0027s slathered in apple butter. She gives Leo a piece and smiles, \"Can we just stay in one place, all of us?\"\n I nod, \"I think so. Unless you have somewhere you need to be?\" My Granny used to say that to my dad all the time. He always had somewhere else to be. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to be with me; it was that he wanted to be ready.\n Sarah takes another bite of pancake. It was the one thing she had to take from Bernie\u0027s, the pancake mix. I\u0027m glad now she did.\n \"Will made them.\"\n I smile, \"You glad he\u0027s back?\"\n She nods, \"Yeah. I just hope Bernie can find his way too.\"\n I frown, \"Honey, Bernie is gone. I watched him die.\"\n She shakes her little head, \"Emma, you were wrong about Will; you\u0027re probably wrong about Bernie too.\"\n The pancake tastes funny to me and hard to swallow. I get it down and nod, \"Yeah, I hope so.\"\n Jake comes in and flops onto the bed too. He smirks, \"How ya doing?\"\n I give Sarah a smile, \"Can you get me some water?\"\n She jumps up, taking Leo with her. I give Jake a look, \"I\u0027m waiting for something terrible to happen. It feels like we should be on the move and killing or fighting. I just don’t trust any of this.\"\n He gives me a grim look, \"I feel the same, like something bad is coming.\"\n I shrug and lay back down, letting him lie across my legs, \"Guess we wait and see, huh?\"\n He slaps my leg, \"Actually, something maybe not awesome has come.\"\n I give him a look, \"Huh?\"\n His grin splits into the goofy one I love, \"The cooking circle ladies are here. They just arrived from Marshall\u0027s camp. They brought food and seeds, and hands to help us get this place functional for winter.\"\n I smile back, \"Really?\" Something about the numbers increasing is making me happier. Older ladies who might be able to deliver a baby also make me happy.\n He nods, \"Yup. Will\u0027s out there chatting with them now. They brought all the seeds they’ve harvested, and because this place is between the retreat and the trade towns, they\u0027re going to use it as their winter base and summer farming area.\"\n I sigh a type of relief, I swear, I have never felt before.\n \"I know, I almost sounded exactly the same when I saw them coming.\"\n I point at him from my back, \"You need to get the firewood piles going.\"\n He laughs, \"You and Will are soul mates, I swear it. I came in here to avoid the firewood.\"\n I smack whatever is closest to me, \"No, go slacker.\"\n He grabs my hand and lifts me off the bed, dragging me down the hallway. Anna walks past me, looking green again. She points at the bed, \"Sleepy.\"\n Jake and I nod. She has been like that for a month.\n I see Will in the yard from the kitchen window. He smiles at me but keeps talking to the ladies, \"If we have that many more people, we need to start getting ready. This house only holds so many. We need guards in the trees and to start getting the field ready to prepare for a spring plant. It\u0027s gonna need to be tilled so we can use it in the spring. I think we can get a lot accomplished in the two months before the snow hits.\"\n The circle ladies smile at me, waving, \"Emma!\"\n I wave back, \"Hi!\"\n \"So this is your place?\" The lady with the red tongue on her tee shirt asks. I shake my head, \"It\u0027s everyone\u0027s.\"\n She smirks, \"Same old Emma. How\u0027s Marshall?\" Her eyes gleam.\n I cock an eyebrow, \"Dead.\"\n She slaps me on the back when I get closer, \"That’s my girl. I always knew you had it in you. That man was a bastard.\" I look past them to see the Jake dog running for me. I drop to my knees and he jumps me, slathering me in wet dog kisses.\n \"Jake dog!\"\n Jake shoves me, \"Shut up.\"\n I rub his face and kiss the top of his shiny head, \"Look how chunky you are getting.\"\n The ladies chuckle, \"Oh, he never strays too far from the cook pot.\"\n I snort and rub his furry, fat tummy, \"I can see that.\" I glance at Will, \"What do you need me to do?\"\n He doesn’t skip a beat, like he\u0027s been planning it, \"Make arrows and teach a few guys how to make bows and arrows. We\u0027ll need them. The ammo is running low. They need to know how to make them and shoot them.\"\n I nod, \"Okay.\" When I stand up, he passes me a hatchet and brushes his lips against mine. It\u0027s like we steal a second and the world stops for us. I blush, thinking about the night before, when we break our kiss. I look down and head across the field to the group of men. The snickers of the ladies and Jake make the blush worse, but the fearful look in the eyes of the group of men makes me feel better.\n \"Who wants to learn how to use a bow and arrow?\" I almost dare them with my tone.\n They look scared for a second but then nods start coming my way.\n I point at the willow tree next to the river on the far side of the field, \"We go this way then.\"\n Chapter Eleven\n It\u0027s my turn in the north tree. Leo is camped at the base of the tree, sleeping. My butt is asleep from sitting for hours, but it makes me feel like, in my small way, it\u0027s not easy. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-26.html","bookId":1606,"book":{"id":1606,"title":"Reborn (Born #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Reborn (Born #3) \n Twenty years ago a man made a child he never intended to love. \n Ten years ago the world ended and Emma turned her back on the man she believed was her father...in an attempt to survive. \n Eight weeks ago she discovered the truth about her family, including the sister she never knew existed. \n Last week she had her heart broken by the one man she never imagined giving it to. \n Yesterday she turned her back on those she cared for in an attempt to help them survive. \n Today she plans on hunting two men to the ends of the broken earth. \n Not to save the world. \n Not to make the world a better place. \n Tomorrow... she plans on getting revenge.(\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reborn-born-3.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:07 PM"}}
