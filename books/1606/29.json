I sigh, \"It hurts.\"\\n\\n He pulls me into his arms, rubbing my butt gently, \"Come on. I\u0027ll give you a butt massage.\"\\n\\n I shove him away, \"No. I can tell you\u0027re all sweaty and red. You didn’t relax.\"\\n\\n He grabs my arm, knowing I hate that and plants a kiss on my lips. I can feel the challenging smile on his lips, \"Come relax with me.\"\\n\\n I shake my head, \"That’s not relaxing.\"\\n\\n He laughs and wraps his arm around me, pulling the horse to the pen.\\n\\n Anna gives me a sad look; she\u0027s talking to Mitch but I can see something is wrong.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s up with Anna?\"\\n\\n He sighs, \"She\u0027s been having cramps all day. She thinks she\u0027s going to lose the baby.\"\\n\\n The words trigger something in my mind, \"Bed rest.\"\\n\\n He frowns, \"What?\"\\n\\n I nod, \"Bed rest. My mom was scared she was losing me; the doctors put her on bed rest.\"\\n\\n He frowns, \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. You get the horse and I\u0027ll get the pregnant, crazy woman into bed.\"\\n\\n He swats me on the butt. I growl but it just makes his eyes flash with humor.\\n\\n Nearly limping, I make it over to her and point at the house, \"Come with me.\"\\n\\n I take her hand and pull her inside. She tries to pull back but I don’t relent. My butt is killing me, my legs are exhausted, and I\u0027m moody and hungry. I get to the back rooms and pull her into the one that she sleeps in alone. I close the door and point at the bed, \"Bed rest.\"\\n\\n She whispers, \"What?\"\\n\\n I nod, \"Bed rest. My mom was sure she was losing me and the doctors put her on bed rest. You had the infection, you shouldn’t even be able to have babies. You need to stay on bed rest.\"\\n\\n Her face drops, \"Em, I\u0027ll go nuts in here.\"\\n\\n I shake my head, \"You have to choose, baby or sanity.\"\\n\\n She kicks her boots off and climbs into the bed. She frowns, \"I need books. That Da Vinci one was good, but I\u0027m out.\"\\n\\n I nod, \"I\u0027ll get books. You sit.\"\\n\\n She wrinkles her nose, \"How long do I have to stay in here?\"\\n\\n I shrug, \"I don’t know. I guess until you feel normal again. Lay back so then the baby can\u0027t fall out.\"\\n\\n She laughs and curls up on the bed. I can see she\u0027s exhausted.\\n\\n I kick my boots off too and climb onto the bed with her. She grimaces, \"You smell like horse.\"\\n\\n I grin, \"Yeah, well I had a shower yesterday at Star\u0027s, so I should smell like the lavender shampoo they\u0027re making there.\"\\n\\n Her eyes bug open, \"The hot water is back?\"\\n\\n I nod.\\n\\n She moans in a wheezy whisper, \"Oh, man. I need a hot shower. I made Nan heat me water on the fire and pour it on me, but it wasn’t the same.\"\\n\\n I close my eyes, \"It was amazing.\"\\n\\n She whispers against my face, \"You ever miss the breeder farm?\"\\n\\n I smile, \"Yup.\"\\n\\n The door opens. I glance back to see Sarah. I laugh, \"Speaking of missing the breeder farms.\"\\n\\n Sarah kicks her shoes off and climbs on the bed with us. \"Will said you were back.\" She curls in between me and Anna. \"I don’t miss the farms, I miss the cook.\"\\n\\n I laugh and close my eyes again.\\n\\n I don’t dream, I sleep completely peacefully. When I wake, I\u0027m next to Will. I open my eyes to see him staring at me. He must have moved me in the night. He runs a hand down my cheek. I smile and close my eyes again. He wraps an arm around me, pulling me into him.\\n\\n \"You smell good.\"\\n\\n I moan, \"Mmmm, I had a shower at Star\u0027s. She knew Bernie had kept a bunch of solar panel stuff in the metal bunker under the house. The H.E.M.P. didn’t ruin it. She had to get something called an inverter fixed and then have it all hooked up. I didn’t think she\u0027d be able to do it, but she did.\"\\n\\n \"They have power?\"\\n\\n I nod.\\n\\n He makes a whistle sound, \"That’s dangerous.\"\\n\\n I open my eyes, \"Why?\"\\n\\n He shakes his head, \"Baby, we never want to have more than anyone else. We don’t want to have the things they don’t. If we have just enough to live, then no one is going to come and attack us and try to take it. People see power and then they want to rule.\"\\n\\n \"But she\u0027s going to get sheriffs and law enforcement. Maybe if they have some hangings or shootings, the bad people will stay away.\"\\n\\n He shakes his head, \"Not smart. Marshall was smart, how he did it. The camp and retreat were based entirely upon the group being a council and us only ever having what we needed. We were never the target of bandits or raids. We had a good population but not too much stuff.\"\\n\\n I feel myself nodding off again, \"It\u0027s sad we can\u0027t ever have anything ever again.\"\\n\\n I sleep through the night, waking to Leo shifting on the bed. Will is wrapped around me totally and Leo is on my feet. I wrestle out from under them both and climb out of bed.\\n\\n My legs are better and my butt doesn’t hurt anymore. There is definitely a perk to being me.\\n\\n I pull on my boots and Will\u0027s long-sleeve shirt. It smells like him, his stink that, for whatever reason, I like.\\n\\n I stroll out into the kitchen. Nan smiles, \"Hey, kid.\"\\n\\n I nod, \"Morning.\"\\n\\n Her eyes dart to the right, \"They caught someone on the property this morning.\"\\n\\n I look at the door and think about what Will and I had talked about. I strap my holsters to my thighs and walk out of the house, \"Just one person?\"\\n\\n She nods.\\n\\n Mitch gives me a look from across the gravel yard. I see a young man with long, dark hair. His dirty face is thin and tired looking. When he sees me, his eyes get trapped, staring at the guns on my legs.\\n\\n I sling my bow and quiver over my shoulder and crunch my way to where Mitch is.\\n\\n \"Found us a friend in the woods. The guards caught him.\"\\n\\n I stare at the dark eyes of the young man and nod, \"Execute him.\"\\n\\n Mitch\u0027s jaw drops, \"He could help around here.\"\\n\\n I shake my head, \"This isn’t a work camp; we don’t keep slaves.\" I walk to the guy, wiping my hand down the dirt on his face, \"This dirt was rubbed on. I bet he followed us yesterday. He\u0027s a scout.\" I lift his lip, discovering perfect, white teeth. I give Mitch a look, \"Take him behind the barn. I\u0027ll execute him.\"\\n\\n Mitch scowls, \"Em, you don’t want to do this.\"\\n\\n I grab the arm of the guy from Mitch, \"I\u0027ll do it myself then.\"\\n\\n The guy\u0027s mouth opens, \"Fine, fine. She\u0027s right. I\u0027m a scout. We fled from the city; we knew where the retreat was. It was on a map. Please, I\u0027m a doctor.\"\\n\\n My eyes narrow, \"You’re twenty—how could you be a doctor?\"\\n\\n His eyes search mine for compassion. I know he\u0027s going to come up empty. He flinches at my cold stare, \"I was apprenticing under some of the doctors in the city. I was learning to be a breeder doctor.\"\\n\\n His eyes are crystal clear, like mine and Star\u0027s, \"You\u0027re a Gen baby.\"\\n\\n His eyes narrow for a second but he doesn’t say anything. His lips press together.\\n\\n I reach up, grabbing his shirt, \"ARE YOU?\"\\n\\n \"YES!\"\\n\\n I jerk him back and release him, \"Shit.\" I look at Mitch, \"He\u0027s my brother, but he\u0027s from the city. Send scouts into the woods.\"\\n\\n The guy’s eyes get nervous when I say it. He makes a face and then smiles, \"You\u0027re Emma.\"\\n\\n I grab his thick arm and drag him to the barn and point at the bunker in the floor, giving Mitch a deadly look, \"Open that.\"\\n\\n Mitch gives me a look but he does it. I push my new brother down into the hole and slam the lip. His green-blue eyes are the last thing I see of his face. I click the latch on the bunker and run my hands over my face, \"Shit.\"\\n\\n Panic is filling me. My father might be in the woods, or at Bernie\u0027s. Of course he would know where the retreat was and where Bernie lived. I slap my forehead, \"Stupid, stupid, stupid.\"\\n\\n Mitch grabs my arm, \"Em, chill out. It\u0027s one guy.\"\\n\\n I shake my head, \"No. The city burned; they have nowhere to go. They’ve never been out here in the wild. They know where we\u0027ve set up camp and villages. They had a room filled with maps. They know where we live.\" I can hear the panic in my voice.\\n\\n I point down at the lid covered in hay, \"That is not a scout—it\u0027s a test. Test to see how fast we respond, how we act, and what kind of place we are, so they know what they need to take this from us.\"\\n\\n Mitch puts his hands on my arms, \"Calm down. Your crazy is showing. This is one guy, one doctor. You could beat him up, he doesn’t stand a chance here. Stay calm.\"\\n\\n I take a deep breath and nod, \"Okay. But I want pairs into the woods, finding them. I know there are more.\"\\n\\n He nods, \"Okay. Me, you, and Leo will be one pair, okay? We\u0027ll do the perimeter.\"\\n\\n I go to whistle for him but Will opens the kitchen door, giving me and Mitch a weird look. Leo leaves the kitchen, sauntering to me. He sniffs the door to the bunker and growls.\\n\\n I step out of Mitch\u0027s arms and point at the bunker door, \"A scout from the city.\"\\n\\n Will closes his eyes, \"Shit.\" He points to the field, \"We need scouting parties out. I want pairs to do a five-mile hike. Me, Em, and Leo will take one route. Mitch…\"\\n\\n I cut him off, \"Will, me and Mitch are going together. You need to rest; me and him can run this perimeter with Leo fast. You need to rest.\"\\n\\n His eyes dart between me and Mitch. He nods and walks back into the house, slamming the door.\\n\\n Mitch sighs, \"He thinks shit is going on, doesn’t he?\"\\n\\n I shake my head, \"That’s not so important right now. Let\u0027s do this and I\u0027ll talk to him afterwards.\"\\n\\n Mitch laughs, \"This is your first boyfriend isn’t it? Go talk to him now.\"\\n\\n I don’t want to. I don’t want to see the angry look on his face, or even worse, the pathetic one. I hate that look. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-29.html","bookId":1606,"book":{"id":1606,"title":"Reborn (Born #3)","description":"Storyline: Reborn (Born #3) \\n Twenty years ago a man made a child he never intended to love. \\n Ten years ago the world ended and Emma turned her back on the man she believed was her father...in an attempt to survive. \\n Eight weeks ago she discovered the truth about her family, including the sister she never knew existed. \\n Last week she had her heart broken by the one man she never imagined giving it to. \\n Yesterday she turned her back on those she cared for in an attempt to help them survive. \\n Today she plans on hunting two men to the ends of the broken earth. \\n Not to save the world. \\n Not to make the world a better place. \\n Tomorrow... she plans on getting revenge.(\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reborn-born-3.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:07 PM"}}
