{"id":42437,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIV","content":"WARD HUMBLES HIMSELF For a long time after he had retired that night Ward rolled and tossed upon his bed, and it seemed to the troubled boy as if sleep would never come. The words of Jack kept sounding in his ears, and do what he would he could not forget them. His heart was heavy too, with the consciousness that the words were true and that he knew he was in a measure at fault. Perhaps that after all was the source of his deepest suffering, for Ward Hill was one of the few boys who could not entirely deceive himself. Again and again he tried to persuade himself that his present suffering all came because he had broken with his former associates in the school. That a measure of truth lay in that fact he could readily persuade himself to believe, but not all of it could be traced to that source. Jack\u0027s references to his unwillingness to aid the other boys and his tendency to have but slight sympathy for those who did not learn as easily as he, had touched him in a tender spot and his own conscience accused him. Then too, he knew that he had withdrawn from the fellowship of many in the school, and had been accustomed to pride himself somewhat upon that very fact. He was not dependent upon any one. If the fellows did not care for him, why, he did not intend to hang his harp on the willows and sit down and mourn over his slights. He would show every one in the school that he could live without his company if needs be. With such statements he had endeavored to bolster up his courage and by an air of bravado, if not of true independence, he would show his own superiority. No one should ever hear him \"whine.\" Yet, despite his efforts, his heart had been heavy all the time. He yearned for the love and good will of his companions. No one in the school more desired to be popular than he. And few too would suffer from the lack of popularity as he did. And his heart had been heavy when he at last had closed his books when the bell was rung that night and he had put out his light and crept into his bed. He was tormented by a dull, heavy feeling of misery. He felt lonely and forlorn. Both Mr. Crane and Jack had virtually admitted that he was not very well liked by the school, and both also evidently thought he was not entirely blameless in the matter. As the truth gradually came to be seen by him, he was sincere enough to acknowledge it to be true and had sufficient strength to rouse himself to face its difficulties. He would follow Jack\u0027s suggestions. On the following morning he said to Jack as they left the chapel together: \"I\u0027m going to follow your advice, and am coming down to play on the scrub against the nine this afternoon. The only thing I\u0027m afraid of is that Tim Pickard will think I\u0027m crawling. You know I\u0027m not trying to get back my place on the team.\" \"That\u0027s all right, Ward,\" replied Jack enthusiastically. \"Never you mind Tim, you just go ahead. It\u0027ll be all right and I\u0027ll see that you have a place on the scrub.\" As a consequence of Jack\u0027s efforts, when in the afternoon Ward went down to the ball ground, Ford, who was acting as the captain of the scrub nine, which was formed to give the regular nine practice every day, said to him, \"Ward, will you take a hand with us this afternoon?\" \"Yes,\" replied Ward quietly. \"All right; play \u0027short\u0027 then, will you?\" As Ward threw aside his coat and walked out upon the field to take the position assigned him, he was conscious that many of the boys who had assembled to watch the nine at its practice were talking of him. His face burned, but he tried hard not to appear aware of the curiosity which his appearance on the field had aroused. The sneer on Tim Pickard\u0027s face was the hardest for him to bear; and when he overheard the words which Tim uttered, evidently intended for Ward\u0027s special benefit, about \"sneaks\" and \"trying to curry favor and crawl back on the team,\" he was sorely tempted to leave the field instantly. But catching a meaning look just then from Jack, he resolutely ignored all that he had heard and seen, and well aware that Tim would be highly delighted even then to have him abandon the game, he tried hard to give his entire attention to the work before him. It was the first game in which Ward had played since he had come back to Weston and he felt sadly his lack of practice. But endeavoring to make up by his efforts what he lacked in practice, he succeeded beyond his hopes in acquitting himself creditably. He handled the ball quickly and threw with all his old-time swiftness. Indeed, he thought more than once of that long throw of his in the game with the Burrs in the preceding year, which had saved the game and won for him the wild applause of his fellows. The recollection served to intensify the difficulties of his present position. How sadly had it all been changed since the preceding year! He was, however, too busy in the game to dwell long upon the misery which the thought produced. When it came to be his turn to bat and he stood facing Tim, who was the pitcher of the Weston nine, he could easily perceive the expression of hatred upon his face. Tim exerted himself to the utmost and sent in the ball with all the speed and curves he could summon. Perhaps his manifest desire to place Ward at a disadvantage served to rouse the latter all the more. At any rate he stood calmly facing Tim, apparently unmoved by all his efforts to annoy him. It became evident to others as well as to Ward that Tim in his anger was trying to hit him with the ball. He sent in two or three at his swiftest speed and Ward had all he could do to dodge them successfully. \"Oh, hold on, Tim!\" called Jack in a low voice from his position at short stop. \"What are you trying to do? You want to remember that we\u0027re not alone here.\" Somehow Jack always seemed to have a strange influence over the captain of the nine, an influence which no other exerted, or even tried to use. And the effect of the words became at once apparent as Tim\u0027s speed slackened and the next ball came in directly over the plate. Just then Ward obtained a glimpse of Mr. Crane, who had come upon the grounds and taken his position in the front line of the spectators, where he stood watching the game. Perhaps the sight of the teacher, or Jack\u0027s words, or the change which came over Tim, served to arouse Ward still more. He never knew just what the cause was; but as he saw the ball coming swiftly toward him, he caught it squarely on the end of his bat and sent it far out over the heads of the waiting fielders. As Ward swiftly cleared the bases, sending in two men before him, he was dimly conscious that a faint cheer had arisen from the spectators. He gave no heed to that, however, nor yet to the words with which Jack hailed him as he ran swiftly past him. Somehow the heavy hit which he had made served in a measure to relieve his feelings, and as he halted upon the third base he wiped his dripping face with his handkerchief and for the first time turned and looked about him. Jack\u0027s face was beaming and Ward could easily see he had risen in the estimation of the spectators. The sight produced a thrill of pleasure in his heart, but he was soon recalled to the necessities of the game and gave himself fully to that. When at last he succeeded in stealing home, the applause again broke out, but Ward held himself aloof from the boys, well satisfied with what he had done. Twice more during the game Ward succeeded in hitting squarely the swiftly thrown balls of the pitcher, and when at last the game was ended, the scrub nine for the first time that season had succeeded in making a creditable showing against the school nine, and Ward knew the success in large measure had been due to his efforts. \"Tell you what, Tim,\" said Jack, as the members of the nine picked up their bats and started for their rooms, \"we\u0027ll have to put up the scrub against the Burrs, I\u0027m thinking. If we don\u0027t look out they\u0027ll be playing all around us.\" Tim made no reply, but a savage scowl crept over his face. He prided himself upon his prowess as a pitcher, and indeed it was freely acknowledged that there was no one in the school in any way to be compared with him. Indeed, it was this fact that chiefly enabled Tim to retain his position as the captain of the nine, for the boys well knew that without him they would be so sadly crippled as to be unable to make a good showing against any team. The fact that Ward Hill, whom he disliked so intensely, had succeeded in successfully batting him that day was gall to the angry boy. He made no reply to Jack\u0027s words, and sullenly departed from the field. Ward did not wait for any of his friends to accompany him as he too started from the ball ground. Jack\u0027s beaming face pleased him greatly, and the words that he overheard some of the boys say about it\u0027s being \"a shame that Hill was not on the nine,\" seemed also to comfort him; but without waiting to speak to any one he drew on his coat and started to go. As he came to the border of the grounds he was surprised as Mr. Crane joined him and said: \"You\u0027ve done well to-day, Hill, and I congratulate you.\" \"Thank you,\" said Ward simply, though his face flushed with pleasure at the words. \"You haven\u0027t been over to see me yet,\" continued Mr. Crane. \"Can\u0027t you come up to my room for a few minutes now?\" \"I\u0027m hardly fit for that,\" said Ward, glancing ruefully at his soiled hands. He knew also that his hair was in disorder and that his face bore many tokens of his recent exertions. \"I understand all that,\" said Mr. Crane quietly. \"If you can spare a few minutes now I should be very glad to have you come. You bear only the honorable signs of battle, and I shall forget them. I want only a few minutes with you.\" \"I\u0027ll come,\" said Ward simply, as he turned and walked with the teacher, and was soon seated in his room. \"Now, Hill,\" said Mr. Crane as soon as he too had taken his seat, \"I don\u0027t want you to think that I\u0027m asking more than I ought, and if you feel that I am you are at liberty not to answer me. But I should be glad to have you tell me why you went down to the ball ground this afternoon and played on the scrub nine. You haven\u0027t done that before, have you?\" \"No,\" said Ward quietly. He was silent a moment, and then, as he looked up, he felt rather than saw that Mr. Crane was regarding him intently. His interest was so apparent that almost before he realized what he was doing Ward had related all his recent troubles to him. He did not mention any names, but he told him of his own feelings when he had listened to his words of the previous interview; also of what \"a friend\"--for so he referred to Jack--had said to him in the same line. He held nothing back. His own bitterness, his feeling that he had been misunderstood, his discouragement and all came out. \"Hill,\" said Mr. Crane when Ward at last ended, \"I\u0027m greatly pleased with you. You haven\u0027t done anything since you came to Weston that has given me such genuine pleasure as that which you have done to-day.\" \"Why, Mr. Crane,\" said Ward quickly, his face flushing as he spoke and a very suspicious moisture appearing in his eyes, \"I didn\u0027t know you cared so much about the game. I thought you would be more pleased over my work in the classes.\" \"I am pleased with both, Hill. I am delighted at the improvement in your class work, and I am no less pleased over what I have seen to-day.\" As Ward appeared somewhat mystified and looked questioningly at him, Mr. Crane continued, \"The class work is important. You know I would be the last to belittle that. But there are many other things to be learned in a school like this. I have been here many years now, and I have had an opportunity to judge of the relative success of the boys as they have gone up to college and out into life, and I must say that many of my old standards of judgment have been revised.\" \"And you don\u0027t think that standing high in the class is first then?\" said Ward eagerly. \"Yes, with you I do, Hill; but first, not all. I want to see every boy do his best, his particular rank in class then becomes a secondary matter. There are some boys who are older when they enter, or much more mature when they are of the same age as their fellows, and of course they do the work more easily and gain a higher standing without much effort. But some students show elements of growth and promise, and although they may not stand so high as some of the others, I can see by the very impetus they receive from working faithfully that they are bound to outstrip the others in the race of life. Then too, school work only tests a man on one side of his mental make-up. His memory may be strong and he may also be able to perceive and receive, but his ability to create or to carry out plans is not tested in the least, or to a very slight degree. So when he gets out into the world and finds that the world is much more prone to ask of him what he can furnish or add to the stock it already has, or what he can do in carrying out his plans, than it is to ask him about his ability to soak in as a sponge does, he doesn\u0027t know just what to make of it. Creative ability and executive ability are but slightly tested in school life, and these are the qualities of success far more than mere receptive power. I don\u0027t know that I make myself clear, using these long words,\" added Mr. Crane smilingly. \"I think I understand you,\" said Ward slowly; \"but I\u0027d never thought of it in that way before. I always thought if a fellow did well in school he\u0027d be likely to outside.\" \"And so he will,\" said Mr. Crane quickly. \"You see I didn\u0027t make myself clear after all. I think success in the main is in him, not in his surroundings, and if he has ability and exerts it in school it will tell there as well as in any other place. If a boy has ability and applies himself he will succeed in school if success is in him. But on the other hand, because a boy has the special kind of ability to succeed in school work it does not always follow that the same qualities will make his life-work a success. And that is the very reason why I am always glad to see a boy tested and meet the test on every side of his life, even while he is in school.\" \"And you think I have been tested?\" \"Yes; and I think you are meeting the tests. School life and school work are two different things. I want not less of one but more of the other. The discipline of hard study is what you need, Hill; and you need also the discipline which only the boys can give you. No teacher can give it, however much he may try. It\u0027s life, not books. Now no discipline for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous. Nevertheless, afterward----\" \"Yes, yes, I see,\" said Ward quickly. \"And you think I am learning? Tell me honestly just what you think, Mr. Crane.\" \"I think you are learning and are doing well in the school life as well as in the school work,\" replied Mr. Crane cordially, as he rose from his chair, a signal which Ward at once understood.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1607/47651.html","bookId":1250,"book":{"id":1250,"title":"Ward Hill the Senior","description":"简介： A school has been very correctly termed a little world of itself.
