{"id":42435,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII","content":"MR. CRANE\u0027S WORDS \"What are you doing here?\" said Tim angrily, as soon as he recovered from his surprise. \"I came over to stack your room.\" \"You did? You did?\" said Tim, as if he could hardly believe what he had heard. His astonishment arose not from the fact that Ward should have come for the purpose which he so calmly expressed, but from the fact that he should have stated it so boldly. The one part Tim could readily understand, but the other was something he could not comprehend. To him there was but one explanation, and that was that Ward was somehow openly defying him, and Tim\u0027s anger was correspondingly increased. With all his faults Tim Pickard was no coward, as the word is ordinarily used. That is, he had no fears of a physical contest, and as he stood in the doorway before him Ward readily perceived what a fine specimen of young manhood in its bodily form Tim was. Tall, with broad shoulders and with the fire and force of vigorous health manifest in every phase of his bearing, he would not be an antagonist whom most boys would care to meet. Ward himself was no weakling. Though he was not so large as Tim, his compact and well-knit frame betokened physical powers of no mean order. And his quiet bearing served to increase the impression of his fearlessness too, and for a moment the two seniors stood quietly facing each other, each being conscious of the fact that a contest between them would be no light affair. \"Well, why don\u0027t you stack it then?\" said Tim at last with a sneer. \"Here\u0027s the room and you\u0027ve got my full consent to go ahead--if you can.\" \"I\u0027m not going to stack it,\" said Ward quietly. \"Oh, you\u0027re not? Well, that\u0027s kind of you, I must say,\" laughed Tim. \"Well, if you\u0027re not going to stack it, will you leave or shall I put you out? I don\u0027t want any sneaking hypocrite prowling around here.\" \"I shall leave, but you won\u0027t put me out,\" replied Ward, his face flushing as he spoke. \"Well, leave then, will you? You can\u0027t do it too soon to suit me.\" Ward did not stir. Tim\u0027s face flushed with anger and he advanced a step nearer the table, and Ward braced himself for the conflict which now appeared to be inevitable. Before anything could be done, however, the door was suddenly pushed open and Jack burst into the room. A hasty glance at the two boys revealed at once to him the condition of affairs, and taking a position between the two, he said: \"Here now, quit this, will you?\" \"You don\u0027t suppose I\u0027m going to sit down quietly and let a fellow go to work stacking my room, do you?\" said Tim. \"This sneak says that was just what he came for.\" \"No, I don\u0027t believe you\u0027d do any such thing,\" replied Jack; \"neither do I think you would think Ward Hill would be likely to do any such thing, either. If he came over here to stack your room, it\u0027s no more than you deserve, and he\u0027d be only paying off old scores.\" \"I never stacked his room,\" replied Tim evasively. \"No, you never had the nerve to do that openly, but you can set such fellows as Ripley and Choate and a lot of others up to it. Oh, you needn\u0027t beg off, Tim Pickard. I know you through and through, and so does Ward Hill too; and if he came over here to set your room up, he knows, and I know, and you know, and I know you know that we know, you\u0027re only being paid off in your own coin.\" Tim was silent, and Jack quickly perceiving his advantage, went on. \"Now, look here, you fellows. You can\u0027t get into any scrap here, not so long as I\u0027m in the room. The first thing you know Ma Perrins would be at the door, and you know she would report the thing at once to Doctor Gray. Then what would happen? You, Tim, aren\u0027t in very good shape for receiving an invitation to come up and confer with him about \u0027the best interests of the school,\u0027 as he puts it. You know what would follow mighty sudden. And Ward here isn\u0027t in just the best position in the world for a faculty meeting, though I think he\u0027d be in a good deal better one than you, Tim, for he\u0027s only trying to protect himself. Even a worm will turn, and I don\u0027t believe Doctor Gray would blame a fellow too much for taking the law into his own hands and trying to put a stop to having his room stacked every day of his life.\" \"But I haven\u0027t stacked his room, I\u0027m telling you,\" interrupted Tim. \"Oh, give that ancient and antiquated aphorism a period of relaxation, will you, Tim? That doesn\u0027t work here, let me tell you. I know what I\u0027m talking about.\" \"But I don\u0027t see what this sneak thinks he\u0027s going to gain by stacking my room,\" persisted Tim. \"I shouldn\u0027t have to set it up again myself. I\u0027m no West Hall pauper. I don\u0027t have to take care of my own room. Thank fortune, I\u0027ve got some one to do my dirty work for me.\" \"Yes, that\u0027s what you\u0027re always doing, Tim Pickard,\" retorted Jack angrily, as he saw Ward flush at the brutal words; \"you\u0027re always getting some one to do that for you. But let me tell you one thing, this stacking of Ward\u0027s room has got to be stopped.\" \"Who\u0027s going to stop it, I\u0027d like to know?\" replied Tim boldly. \"Oh, there\u0027s more than one way of doing that,\" replied Jack quietly. \"Now, if you don\u0027t want to be sent home again for good and all, you\u0027ll see to it that Ward Hill\u0027s room isn\u0027t troubled again. That\u0027s all I\u0027ve got to say about it.\" \"What\u0027ll you do? Go and report it to Doctor Gray?\" \"I\u0027m not telling what\u0027ll be done, but I am telling you that it isn\u0027t going to happen again. I know you and you know me, and you know too that I don\u0027t talk for the fun of hearing my own voice. Come on, Ward,\" he added, \"you\u0027ll not be bothered any more after this. Good-bye, Tim,\" he called out as he and Ward together left the room. But Tim made no response. Neither of the boys spoke until they were in front of East Hall, then as Ward turned to go to his own room, Jack said, \"What was the trouble? You had time enough to rip the carpet apart, to say nothing of upsetting everything in the room.\" \"I can\u0027t explain it, Jack; I don\u0027t know just why I didn\u0027t, but I couldn\u0027t do it, and that\u0027s all there was about it. When I got into the room, it all came over me what a mean, contemptible thing it was, and how I felt toward Tim for his work in West Hall; and on his table was a picture of his dead mother appearing to look reproachfully at me. It seemed to me that I couldn\u0027t do it, and if I did I\u0027d be doing the very thing that set me so against him. And so I couldn\u0027t, and that\u0027s all there is about it.\" \"You\u0027re a queer chap,\" said Jack thoughtfully. \"I thought I knew you pretty well, but I\u0027ve got to give you up, I\u0027m afraid. Ma Perrins came out into the hall while I was on guard there, and as I saw she looked a little surprised to see me, I went into the parlor with her just to quiet her fears and give you a chance to put in your fine work. I was horrified when I saw Tim rush into the house like a young whirlwind, and before I could call to him he was up the stairs as if he\u0027d been shot out of a gun. You\u0027d better believe I cut short my interview with Ma and made a break for Tim\u0027s room. I was half afraid I\u0027d find only a few small pieces of you and Tim left, and that I\u0027d have to beg the loan of one of Ma\u0027s platters to bring you home on. But I can\u0027t make you out, Ward. I hardly know now why you didn\u0027t fix Tim\u0027s room so that it would have been a living monument of your ability in that line. That\u0027s what I\u0027d have done.\" As Ward made no reply, Jack added: \"Well, never mind, old fellow! Perhaps it\u0027s just as well. Tim won\u0027t bother you again, that is, I mean you won\u0027t have your room stacked again. You can rest easy about that.\" \"Thank you, Jack. You\u0027ve been a good friend to me, and I need friends too.\" \"Don\u0027t mention it,\" replied Jack impulsively, as he reached forth his hand and shook Ward\u0027s warmly. \"Good-night.\" \"Good-night, Jack.\" When Ward, returned to his room, Henry was there and working over his lessons. At first he was tempted to tell his room-mate all about his experience, but fearing that Henry like Jack might misunderstand him he remained silent, and soon took his seat at his own table and began to work on his lessons. It was some time, however, before he could bring his mind to bear upon his task. The scene in Tim Pickard\u0027s room kept rising before him. His anger and the part Jack had taken were still vivid. What a good fellow Jack was, Ward thought, and he appreciated his aid the more when he realized what it might mean for the impulsive lad to bring upon himself the anger of the \"Tangs.\" And yet how fearless he had been, and in what a manly way he had taken his stand. Even then Ward could almost hear his words as he told Tim that the trouble in West Hall must cease. Would Tim heed? Somehow Ward felt that he would, at least in so far as the stacking of his room was concerned; but in other ways doubtless he would be made aware that Tim had not forgotten him. And Tim was one who never forgot. At last he succeeded in banishing from his mind for the time, the recollection of the scene in Mrs. Perrins\u0027 house, and gave himself wholly to his work. On the following night Ward started to go to Mr. Crane\u0027s room. Somehow he dreaded the interview, and yet go he must. Mr. Crane he knew would expect him to come, and that scene in Ripley\u0027s room must be explained to his satisfaction. Ward had thought over the matter many times, but as yet had arrived at no satisfactory course for him to follow. One thing was certain, and that was that he could not tell Mr. Crane about Tim Pickard. That was against the school\u0027s code of honor, and Ward\u0027s own feelings forbade it as well. He was still undecided what to do when he rapped on Mr. Crane\u0027s door and was at once admitted by the teacher himself. Apparently Mr. Crane had not changed, nor did he seem in any way suspicious of the boy before him. And yet that very quietness was most impressive to Ward, and had ever been the one element in the teacher\u0027s character and bearing which had most influenced him. After a few general words Ward felt that he could bear it no longer, and breaking in somewhat abruptly, he said: \"Mr. Crane I want to put a case before you.\" \"Yes?\" said Mr. Crane, lifting his eyes inquiringly, but not otherwise changing his manner. \"I want to know just what you would do. You seem to understand boys so well.\" \"I don\u0027t just know what I should do, if I didn\u0027t understand a little more clearly than I do now what was expected of me,\" answered Mr. Crane, smiling slightly as he spoke. \"Well, it\u0027s just this way. Suppose a fellow--I mean a boy--had come up to the Weston school, and was here a year. Suppose too, that he hadn\u0027t done very well. He\u0027d neglected his work and was a great disappointment to his father and mother, and to his teachers, to say nothing of himself. Then suppose he\u0027d fallen in with a set of the fellows--I mean boys--who were up to all sorts of mischief and he\u0027d gone in with them, though all the time he didn\u0027t feel right about it. Then suppose he\u0027d failed in his examinations at the end of the year, but that he tried to make them up during the summer. We\u0027ll say he came back to school and was able to go on with his class. When he came back he tried to break off with his old associates, but he didn\u0027t find it a very easy thing to do. They wouldn\u0027t believe in him, and when at last they found he really was trying to do differently, then they tried to make his life a burden to him.\" Ward stopped a moment as if he expected some kind of a reply, but as Mr. Crane was silent he resumed his story. \"Well, if it didn\u0027t sound too much like telling tales, we\u0027ll suppose these fellows--I mean students--tried to do all they could to make life a burden for the boy. They put him off from the nine, they prejudiced the minds of the new boys against him, and some of the old ones too. But that wasn\u0027t all. They played all kinds of tricks on him, and worst of all they began to stack his room. I don\u0027t know that you understand what that means?\" added Ward quickly. \"I think I understand,\" said Mr. Crane quietly. \"Well, this boy--I mean fellow--no, I don\u0027t, I mean boy--would find his room all upset every day. His carpet would be torn up, he\u0027d find that water had been poured on his bed, and sometimes the oil from his lamp would be added too. The fellow--boy I mean--really wanted to study, but he had to take lots of his time from his lessons to set his room to rights. Finally he went at it and found out who was doing the mischief. He discovered that some one had a key to his room, but he found out too, that the fellow--I mean boy--who had the key wasn\u0027t the one who was stacking his room. He kept out of it himself, but set other fellows--I mean boys--up to it. And the worst of it all was that they were picking on Little P--I mean on a little fellow who rather looked up to this boy for help. \"Well, finally the boy fixed a trap and caught the one who was trying to get into his room that day. He went over to his room and started to make him give up the key--but--but--he was interrupted, and somehow he didn\u0027t do it. Then he went down to the fellow\u0027s room--the one at the bottom of it all--and was going to stack his room well, so as to let him know how it felt. But when he got there he somehow couldn\u0027t bring himself to do it, and while he was hesitating, the fellow in whose room he was came back and there was a great row. \"No, there was no fight,\" he hastily added, as he saw the question in the teacher\u0027s eyes; \"but the fellow didn\u0027t know but the boy was trying to stack his room. Now, there\u0027s the story, Mr. Crane. I wish you\u0027d tell me what you would do if you were that boy.\" For a few moments Mr. Crane was silent, but at last he said: \"Hill, I\u0027ll try to be entirely frank with you. In the first place, I think I should honor the boy who had gained the victory over himself in that fellow\u0027s room. He couldn\u0027t afford to do the very same thing he despised in the other fellow.\" Ward\u0027s face flushed with pleasure, for he felt that praise from Mr. Crane was praise indeed. \"I\u0027m not done yet,\" resumed Mr. Crane quietly. \"Then, if I were that boy, I think I should begin to question myself and see if there was any just cause for the school being down upon me. It may have been that that boy was somewhat conceited, and a little selfish. He was all the time perhaps thinking how the school ought to appreciate everything he did, and he did not have quite the necessary courage to face calmly the results of his own misdeeds.\" \"But, Mr. Crane,\" protested Ward, \"the fellow knew he\u0027d done wrong. He wasn\u0027t trying to crawl.\" \"Perhaps so, but it is also possible that he thought he ought to be praised unduly for simply turning about and doing his duty. In the main, Hill, boys are just; and while doubtless injustice creeps in at times, it is still true that if a fellow has trouble, he ought not only to think of that, but of what he may be doing to bring it upon himself.\" \"Then you think the boy ought to keep still and let his room be stacked every day, do you?\" \"Not at all; I want him to cure that in the right way, but I want him also to think not only of the stacking, but of the reason for its being stacked.\" \"It was stacked because he broke with the fellows he\u0027d been going with,\" said Ward bitterly. \"In part, yes; but in part, no. Think it over, Hill, and come and see me again in a week.\" \"Good-night, Mr. Crane,\" said Ward somewhat abruptly, as he left the room. He felt hurt and humiliated. Somehow he had thought Mr. Crane would speak very differently. Was that to be the reward for trying to do better? It seemed to him that he had been abused and misunderstood, and in no very amiable frame of mind Ward walked back to West Hall.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1607/47649.html","bookId":1250,"book":{"id":1250,"title":"Ward Hill the Senior","description":"简介： A school has been very correctly termed a little world of itself.
