{"id":42439,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVI","content":"THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT GAME \n \n The following morning dawned clear and bright, and many a boy in the Weston school gave a sigh of relief when first he looked from his windows. The rugged hills, now covered with the highly tinted autumn foliage, displayed patches of clouds resting on their summits or creeping far up along the wooded slopes. The sun, however, would soon burn away all such slight affairs as these gray-colored floating clouds or stretches of fog, and the boys were rejoicing. \n \n The games with the Burrs were the great events of the school year. Not only were the schools themselves of equally high standing, and in a sense rivals, but the advantage for a few years now in the ball games had been with the Burrs, and the Weston boys consequently were especially eager to win this time. As the game was to be played upon their own grounds they had a slight advantage, but all were somewhat nervous and the excitement ran correspondingly high. \n \n There were to be recitations in the morning only. It was almost impossible for the eager lads to hold themselves to their work, but the teachers were somewhat lenient with them, and some of the ludicrous mistakes were passed over with a smile. \n \n Indeed, it was whispered that the teachers themselves were not far behind the boys in sharing the excitement which pervaded the school, and were as desirous that the nine should win as were the players themselves. \n \n Soon after noon autos could be seen coming along the pretty valley roads or making their way over the hillsides. But whether from hill or valley made no difference, for there was one destination for them all and that was the ball ground. Old and young, men and women, boys and girls were there, and the assembled crowd gave promise of being unusually large. \n \n The great busses filled with the boys and girls from the neighboring school began to put in an appearance, for the rival school was co-educational in its methods, and the girls were apparently as eager and excited as their brothers. Long streamers and banners floated out from behind the well-filled machines and many of the girls were waving flags or long ribbons of the school colors, handily adjusted to a cane or some similar device. \n \n A crowd of the Weston boys was waiting in front of the chapel for the Burr nine to come, for it was known that they were to have a special auto. \n \n Some of the members of the Weston nine, clad in their bright new uniforms, mingled with the crowd and as a committee were waiting to welcome and conduct the visiting nine to the dressing rooms. Their efforts to appear calm and unmindful of the attention they attracted provoked a smile from some of the waiting boys, but no one begrudged them the honors which were theirs, and as they joined in the shouts and laughter which continually arose, or stopped to converse about the prospects of the nine in the coming game, the interest steadily increased. \n \n \"There they are! There they come!\" suddenly some one in the crowd shouted, and in a moment the sound of the horn carried by the Burrs could be heard in the distance. In a brief time the huge auto drew up before the crowd and the Burr nine leaped nimbly out upon the ground. \n \n \"Hello, Shackford,\" said Tim Pickard advancing and grasping the outstretched hand of the rival captain. \"Glad to see you. If we have as big a game as we have crowd, there will be something to see before night comes.\" \n \n Tim proceeded to shake hands with each member of the team and then at once started with them to lead the way to the rooms which had been assigned to the visitors. \n \n The waiting crowd parted and stood watching with undisguised curiosity the opposing nine as they filed past them following Tim. Certainly they were a sturdy lot, and the low murmurs which could be heard among the Weston boys as the others withdrew were not entirely those of confidence in the success of their own team. \n \n Meanwhile Ward Hill had gone down to the ball ground and lay on the grass in the rear of the field in a place from which he could easily follow the progress of the game. \n \n Beside him were Henry and Jack, both in uniforms, the latter sitting erect and occasionally pounding the ground before him with the bat he was holding in his hands. Not one of the trio was happy, and Ward least so of the three, although he was striving manfully to appear unmindful of the excitement which, though subdued, was still apparent on all sides of them. \n \n \"It\u0027s tough, Ward,\" said Jack; \"I want to win this game, but I never went into one with such a mean feeling as I\u0027ve got now. It\u0027s a shame you\u0027re not to play. It\u0027s worse than a shame. The nine needs you and I know how you feel, old fellow. Say, Ward,\" he added, suddenly leaping to his feet, \"if you\u0027ll say the word, we\u0027ll fix Tim yet. Henry and I can go to him and declare that if he won\u0027t take you on, we\u0027re off. And he\u0027ll have to give in now, with the crowd all here and everything ready to begin.\" \n \n \"Yes, Ward, that\u0027s what we\u0027ll do,\" chimed in Henry. \"It can be done now.\" \n \n \"No, fellows,\" said Ward shaking his head. \"I told you I couldn\u0027t go on in that way; and then too, I\u0027m not in practice, you know.\" \n \n \"Bother the practice! You\u0027ll do better without it than most of us can with it. Here they come, Ward! Say the word and the deed\u0027s done.\" \n \n But Ward still shook his head. He could not bring himself to do what Jack asked. And yet how he did long to be in the game! \n \n The appearance of the nines upon the field was greeted by a shout and the school cheers were almost deafening on every side. The banners and flags were waving, the girls were standing erect in the autos, and the entire scene was stirring and exhilarating in the highest degree. \"Good luck to you, fellows,\" said Ward as Jack and Henry started to go and join their comrades. \n \n Neither of them replied save by the look which they gave him and soon were with the nine. \n \n The ground was cleared now, and the allotted time of preliminary practice for each team was given. As Ward watched the boys it almost seemed to him that he could not endure the sight. Only a year before and he had been one of the team. Even now he could feel again the thrill which he had when at the close of that famous game his mates had borne him from the field on their shoulders. But now no one seemed to care whether he played or not. And all the time there was the consciousness in his own heart that there was not a better player than he in all the Weston school. \n \n Summoning all his resolution he left his place and took a position near the end of the long line of Weston boys who were standing well back on one side of the ground. He had seen Big Smith and Pond there, and even their company was comforting to him now. \n \n \"Hello, Ward,\" was Big Smith\u0027s hail as Ward approached; \"I should think you would wish you were on the nine now. Do you know, I almost feel as if I could play well enough myself to take a position.\" \n \n Ward made no response, though Big Smith little realized how his words had stung the troubled boy. The Weston nine had taken their positions in the field and the game was about to begin. \n \n Ward glanced out toward left field, his old position, and his heart was bitter toward Ripley, who now was playing there. Ward knew he could fill the place much better than Ripley ever could. Indeed, his heart was so bitter that he was almost divided in his feelings between his desire for the Weston boys to win, and that Ripley and Tim should not put up a good game. \n \n But everything was in readiness now and the hush which came over the assembly betrayed the suppressed excitement. Shackford grasped his bat and advanced to the plate, the umpire tossed the ball to Tim and gave the word, and the game with the Burrs was begun. \n \n Tim settled himself into his position, drew back his arm and sent the ball in with all the speed he could put forth. Shackford for two years had been captain of the Burr nine and his prowess was well known. There was no one the Weston boys feared as they did him. \n \n Shackford was ready, and the very first ball Tim sent in he caught fairly on the end of the bat and sent far down the field close to the foul flag. \n \n A shout of delight arose from all the friends of the Burrs as the runner started swiftly toward the first base. \n \n \"Foul, foul ball!\" called the umpire and Shackford stopped suddenly on his way to the second base. \n \n A murmur of disapproval arose from the crowd, and Ward, who was standing not very far from the place where the ball had struck, shook his head. To him the ball had seemed fair, but he said nothing and admired the spirit of Shackford as he raised his hand toward his supporters, betokening his desire for no manifestations of the kind which had just been heard, and went slowly back to the home-plate and once more picking up his bat stood facing the pitcher. \n \n \"One strike!\" called the umpire as Tim sent the ball swiftly in. \n \n \"Two strikes!\" he called again as the second ball went whistling past. \n \n A low murmur could be heard as the excitement of the watching crowd increased. Shackford was ready and stood grimly waiting for Tim\u0027s next move. \"One ball\" and \"two balls\" followed and the strain on all was becoming more intense. \n \n The next ball, however, was apparently the very one for which the captain of the Burrs had been waiting, for he struck it hard and squarely, and it went far up into the air directly into the territory which Ripley was guarding. \n \n Again a shout of delight was heard from the supporters of the Burrs, but it was hushed in a moment as Ripley took his stand and waited with outstretched hands for the descending ball. \n \n Shackford was speeding on toward the third base, but Ward was unmindful of him. He was watching his supplanter in left field. The ball settled lower and lower; but whether it was because Ripley was highly excited or had misjudged the ball was not known; it struck his hands and bounded out again. The fielder had squarely muffed it. \n \n A groan arose from the Weston boys, and \"Hi! yi! yi!\" came from many of the friends of the Burrs. \n \n Ward could not lament Ripley\u0027s failure, that would have been too much to expect of human nature; but still he turned angrily, as he heard the shouts, and then said to Little Pond: \"That\u0027s a mean trick! no one ought to applaud his opponents\u0027 errors.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t see why not,\" said Big Smith. \n \n \"Because it\u0027s no way to do,\" said Ward. \"If you can\u0027t win squarely you don\u0027t want to win at all. But keep still. Let\u0027s see what\u0027ll be done now.\" \n \n Shackford was on third base now, and as he kept dancing about, Tim, who had the ball, threw it to the baseman, but in his eagerness he sent it over his head among the crowd. Shackford ran home, much to the delight of his friends and the chagrin of the Weston boys. The first run had been scored with no one out. \n \n Three more of the Burrs nine crossed the plate before the inning closed, the success of Shackford evidently encouraging his followers even more than the glaring errors of their opponents. When the Weston boys came in to take their turn at the bat their faces were glum and the prospect was far from bright. Tim was the first batter, and got his base on balls. \n \n As Jack Hobart stepped to the plate to follow him, Ward turned to the boys near him and called: \"Let\u0027s give him a cheer, fellows!\" \n \n The cheers rang out, Ward\u0027s voice being the loudest of them all. Evidently Jack felt the stimulus, for he sent the ball between left and center fields, and Tim was soon on third, while Jack rested on second. But neither could go any farther. The next two batters struck out, and the third sent up a little fly which Shackford himself easily caught. \n \n \"Four to nothing,\" said Ward as the sides changed. \"Not a very bright outlook.\" But the inning closed without another run being scored. \n \n On the Weston side Henry succeeded in making the circuit of the bases and thus scored the first run for the team. The two succeeding innings failed to add to the score of either side. Both nines were playing desperately, and the interest and excitement of the spectators momentarily increased. \n \n \"Four to one,\" said Ward as the fifth inning was begun. \n \n He had led the cheering in the portion of the crowd where he stood, and in his eagerness for the Weston boys to win, for the time he had almost forgotten his own disappointment. Ripley had struck out each time he had been at the bat, and certainly his success in the field had not been very marked thus far. \n \n Again it was Shackford\u0027s turn to bat, and as he advanced to the plate the expression of determination on his face was to be clearly seen. Four to one was certainly no small advantage, and the captain of the Burrs was determined to hold it if such a thing were possible. \n \n Again he waited until two strikes and two balls had been called. The crowd evidently was anxious, but Shackford appeared to be as cool and calm as if nothing were expected from him. \n \n Ward had glanced aside a moment. The suspense of the spectators was interesting if nothing more. He was suddenly recalled by a yell which seemed to have arisen from a thousand throats. Shackford had lifted the ball high into the air, and once more it was coming directly into Ripley\u0027s territory. \n \n The eager fielder started after the ball. He was compelled to run back and to Ward it seemed as if the ball were going far over his head. But having gone back as far as was necessary, Ripley turned sharply and ran in. The ball was settling lower and lower now, and just as the fielder stretched forth his hands for it his feet slipped from under him and he fell headlong on the ground, while the ball went rolling far beyond him. \n \n When he had regained his footing and sent the ball in Shackford was once more on third base. A low but pronounced murmur rose from the Weston crowd which could be heard even above the shouts of the Burrs, but in a moment silence was restored, as the next batter took his place and faced Tim. The crack which resounded when he struck the ball could be heard all over the field. As if with design the ball went skipping along the ground after it struck just back of Jack\u0027s position as short stop, and went rolling swiftly toward Ripley. The excited lad tried desperately to stop it, but failed, and the ball slipped between his legs and went on far behind him. \n \n The murmurings of the crowd were unmistakable now. \"Put him off! Put him out! Hill! Hill! Ward Hill! Put him off! Put him out! Ward Hill!\" could be heard on every side. \n \n Ward\u0027s heart was beating rapidly, and he tried to draw back out of sight; but for two minutes the cries continued, for boys are merciless in their judgments. At last quiet was in a measure restored and the game went on, but the inning closed with the score six to one against the Weston boys. \n \n Ward could see that a crowd of angry students, chief among whom were Jack and Henry, quickly surrounded Tim and an animated conversation took place, though he could not hear any of the words which were spoken. He was hardly prepared for what followed, however, for after a momentary hesitation Tim started down the lines of the waiting spectators, and as he caught sight of Ward he quickly turned and approached him. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1607/47653.html","bookId":1250,"book":{"id":1250,"title":"Ward Hill the Senior","description":"简介： A school has been very correctly termed a little world of itself.
