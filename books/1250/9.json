{"id":42431,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII","content":"PERPLEXITY \\n\\n \\n\\n An exclamation of anger burst forth from Ward\u0027s lips, and even Henry\u0027s ordinary calm was somewhat disturbed by the sight. Chairs, tables, bedding, and carpets were all piled in one indiscriminate mass in the center of the room. The dim light from the hall only served to increase the impression of confusion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Henry,\" said Ward ruefully, when they entered the room and had carefully shut the door, \"it\u0027s too bad that you have to be punished too for my sins. Whoever did this, evidently intended to make a thorough piece of work of it. Isn\u0027t it a sight to behold!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never mind me, Ward,\" said Henry quietly. \"I\u0027m ready to take my share; all I\u0027m sorry about is that somebody has such a mean spirit. What fun there can be in tearing everything to pieces like this I cannot see for my part.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It hasn\u0027t been done for the fun of it; you can rest easy about that,\" replied Ward. \"I wish the one who did it was here now. I\u0027d make him take a hand in fixing up the room again. Hello, the lamp\u0027s broken!\" he added angrily as he found the broken lamp in the midst of the heap on the floor. \"Yes, and they\u0027ve poured the oil all over everything too. It\u0027s a good deal worse than it was this afternoon and that was bad enough. We\u0027ll have to borrow a lamp, I\u0027m thinking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, mine\u0027s all right,\" said Henry quickly, as he drew forth his own lamp from the border of the confused mass. \\n\\n \\n\\n In a moment he had lighted it, and both boys stood for a moment and gazed ruefully at the wreck before them. Ward was almost too angry to speak now. All his quiet labor in the afternoon had been useless, and now a task even worse than the one which he had faced then was before him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We might as well go at it now as any time,\" said Henry quietly, removing his coat as he spoke, and preparing to begin the work. \"It\u0027s got to be done, Ward, and the sooner we do it the better. Come on, old fellow, we\u0027ll soon have it all straightened out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward made no reply, but he at once prepared to follow his room-mate\u0027s example, and soon both boys were busily at work. Several times there came a rap on their door, but they did not heed it, for neither was in a mood to welcome callers. \\n\\n \\n\\n They continued eagerly at the task, working rapidly, and it was not long before the room began to take on once more something of its former appearance. The study bell had rung, however, before their labors were ended, and the rap on the door which soon came they recognized at once as Mr. Blake\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward himself opened the door in response to the summons, and as he stood facing the tall teacher the flush on his face caused by his anger and his exertions had not entirely disappeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m surprised, Hill, not to find you at your studies. A senior ought not to set an example like this. I shall wait to see that you begin your work promptly and properly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward was too angry to offer any explanation. He bade Mr. Blake enter, and as he offered him a chair, he saw that Henry had at last succeeded in partially adjusting the last remaining belongings of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027re all right now, Mr. Blake,\" said Henry quietly. \"There were some things which had to be attended to before we could begin to study.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You ought not to take the study hours for such work,\" responded Mr. Blake, rising as he spoke. \"I\u0027ve heard you pounding up here for some time, and hoped you\u0027d settle down so as not to disturb the others. You ought to bear in mind that there are other boys as well as yourselves in West Hall, and some of them I\u0027m glad to say manifest a disposition to work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As Mr. Blake went out of the room Ward could restrain himself no longer. \"That\u0027s always the way with that man!\" he said angrily. \"No matter what you do, or how hard you try, it\u0027s all the same. He has to put in his word and it\u0027s always the wrong word at the right time too. I wish he didn\u0027t have charge of West Hall.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, well, never mind, Ward. He doesn\u0027t understand us very well, that\u0027s a fact; but so long as we know he doesn\u0027t, we know about what to expect. We\u0027ll get to work now and forget all about Mr. Blake, and that the room ever was stacked. It doesn\u0027t look how as if it had been troubled. You can\u0027t see anything wrong about it, can you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, but I can smell it,\" said Ward half-laughingly, for the odor of the kerosene which had been spilled was only too apparent in the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n However, the boys soon seated themselves by Henry\u0027s table and began their work for the evening. It was some time before Ward could bring his thoughts to bear upon the work in hand, but at last he succeeded and studied hard all the evening. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There, I haven\u0027t my work all done,\" he said when at last the bell was rung indicating that the end of the study hour had come. \"I must have more time. I\u0027m going down to ask Mr. Blake for permission to sit up a little longer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let me go,\" said Henry quickly, but Ward was out of the room by this time and made no reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n In response to his request Mr. Blake shook his head and refused permission. Ward went slowly back to his room thoroughly angry. The teacher\u0027s manner betrayed his suspicion of the boy, and Ward did not take time to consider that Mr. Blake did not know anything of the new resolution he had formed, or of the struggle which was going on in his own mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n He closed the door with a slam as he came back and expressed his opinion in no mild terms of the man who was in charge of West Hall. Henry strove to soothe the angry feelings of his room-mate, but without avail, and when at last the boys retired for the night, Ward\u0027s anger had steadily increased. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Even Mr. Crane would be satisfied now,\" he thought as he drew the bedclothes up around him. \"I\u0027ve got enough anger, as he called it, to supply every boy in West Hall.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But he was too tired to cherish his feelings for any length of time and was soon asleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was awake long before the breakfast hour, and hastily arising resumed his studying. By the time Henry had joined him he had his work all done, and felt that he was thoroughly ready for the tasks of the day. The fact gave him much satisfaction, and when they started toward the dining hall much of his anger had disappeared, so far as any outward manifestation of it was concerned; but deep down in his heart Ward was thinking of his own troubles. Perhaps he even tried to cherish the feeling of anger a trifle, for it was so much more easy to work and face the school when he was aroused, than it was when only the fact of his own unpopularity was most apparent. \\n\\n \\n\\n However, he had decided upon one course of action, at least, and that was what he would have to say to Jack Hobart. A fine friend he was! After all his protestations of friendship, to go over to West Hall and get the keys to his room! For Ward had not a doubt in his mind that Jack had been the one to carry out the scheme which he believed Tim Pickard had concocted. Not that Jack had \"stacked\" the room himself. Ward did not for a moment believe that. But he knew Jack Hobart so well that he was certain he would strive to keep in the good graces of all the school, and if he saw the tide setting too strongly against him Ward somehow felt that Jack would desert him. Had he not done that very thing in the preceding year? It was true he had professed to be sorry, but what did \"feeling sorry\" amount to, since he failed to stand beside him when troubles came? \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack had expected trouble to come too, and Ward thought somewhat bitterly of his friend\u0027s words, and how he had declared that his vertebr? and upper lip should manifest their power in the time of trial. And the trying time had come. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward thought of the scene a few days before this time at the Rockford Station, when Jack had come on the afternoon train. How eager he had been then for him to come back to the Weston school! And what strong words concerning his own friendship he had used too! And Ward had believed him; that was the worst of it all. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the \"Tangs\" had declared against him, and the troubled boy could not entirely shake off the feeling that Jack had not broken with them, and that his own troubles were mainly to be traced to that body. Doubtless they were compelling Jack to bear his share now, and were hoping to increase his own troubles by that very fact. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward\u0027s heart was filled with these somewhat bitter reflections as he entered the Latin room. How cool all the boys were to him! Scarcely any one had a word for him now, and only a few months before they had been free enough with their applause and words of praise. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack was already in his seat when Ward entered and his beaming face showed that he evidently was waiting for him to come. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say, valedic,\" said Jack, as Ward took his seat, \"just translate a bit of this stuff for me, will you? It\u0027s too much for me. My massive brain is not equal for the task.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There won\u0027t be time,\" said Ward coldly. \"Here\u0027s Mr. Crane now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack looked at him a moment in surprise and Ward noticed somewhat bitterly that he was evidently pained too. What a hypocrite he must be! or else Ward must have been mistaken in supposing Jack was concerned in the upsetting of his room. But that was hardly possible. Had not Mike himself said he had loaned his bunch of keys to him? Surely no other one then could be at fault. \\n\\n \\n\\n The recitation now began and as Ward was soon called upon to recite, all other thoughts were immediately banished from his mind. He did his work well and noted the quiet smile upon Mr. Crane\u0027s face as he took his seat. It was the mark of approval which he always gave when the work was done to his complete satisfaction. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward\u0027s troubles, however, soon returned. Of what advantage was it all for him to do well in his classes when apparently the hand of every fellow in the school seemed to be turned against him? Outside of Henry and Little Pond it did not seem as if he had a friend left. He wished he had not come back to the school. But he had come, there was no escape from that fact, and all that remained now was to be as brave as possible and not be overcome by his enemies. \\n\\n \\n\\n And yet how easy it would be to put an end to all his annoyances and once more be at peace with the boys. There was his place on the nine too; he knew he could have it again. All he would have to do to regain that and also to have the popularity which once was his, was to go in with the \"Tangs\" once more. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward glanced up at Mr. Crane. How he did respect the man! How kind he had been during the summer, and how sincere his interest was now! Then too, there was Little Pond, who placed such implicit confidence in him. He was almost irritated by the dependence of the lad, and yet he liked the little fellow in spite of it all. No, he could not yield now, Ward thought. He had begun, and he must carry the struggle through to the end. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the hour came to a close, Ward realized that although he had made a good recitation himself, he had not heard much of what had been said by either Mr. Crane or the boys. He had been busied with his own thoughts and fighting again the battle which seemed as if it never was to cease. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say, Jack,\" he said as the boys rose to pass out of the room, \"I want to see you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad of it, Ward,\" replied Jack as he joined Ward, and they walked together across the campus toward Dr. Gray\u0027s room. \"I\u0027d begun to think you never wanted to see me again. I\u0027ve been racking my brains to see what the difficulty was.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jack,\" said Ward, apparently ignoring his declaration, \"what did you get Professor Mike\u0027s keys for yesterday?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What did I get Mike\u0027s keys for?\" repeated Jack, a look of astonishment creeping over his face as he spoke. \"I don\u0027t know what you mean. I haven\u0027t had his keys.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His astonishment apparently was sincere and for the first time Ward\u0027s heart misgave him. Could it be that he had been mistaken? But there was the janitor\u0027s own declaration. He himself had said he had loaned the keys to Jack, and certainly he could have no motive in saying so if it had not been true. He had implicated himself by the statement as it was, and had openly confessed to violating one of the strictest of Dr. Gray\u0027s rules by doing so. No, Mike must have told the truth; there could be no other explanation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t had Mike\u0027s keys?\" said Ward, slowly turning and looking Jack full in the face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; honor bright, I haven\u0027t had \u0027em, Ward. No, hold on! Let me see! Come to think of it, I did ask him for them yesterday, that\u0027s a fact, but I\u0027d forgotten all about it till you brought it back to my benighted mind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, then you did have them,\" said Ward bitterly, not able to repress the sneer on his face as he spoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, yes,\" said Jack. \"The way of it was this, I was over by West Hall. The fact is, Ward, I was there to get you to go down to the ball ground. One of the boys wanted to get a bat which was up in my room, but Luscious had my keys and I asked Mike for his. There was no harm in that, was there, Ward?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who was the fellow that you gave them to, or did you go yourself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I didn\u0027t go myself; but I see there\u0027s something wrong, so I don\u0027t believe I ought to tell you who the chap was. I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s something off color.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well,\" said Ward; \"of course you can do as you please about that. I think, though, I may be able to get along without your information. You\u0027d made so many protests that you were my friend that I didn\u0027t know but you\u0027d be willing to help me out in this. But I sha\u0027n\u0027t trouble you if you don\u0027t want to tell me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward could see a look of pain come over Jack\u0027s face as he spoke, but his own heart was hard and bitter, and apparently he cared but little for the effect his words might produce. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say, Ward, old fellow,\" said Jack quietly, \"don\u0027t talk like that. It hurts me. I was just going to say something to you, but the way you act makes me think you wouldn\u0027t care to hear it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They were now at the entrance to the recitation room and the conversation naturally ceased. Ward was sadly perplexed. Jack\u0027s astonishment and evident pain at his words troubled him greatly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack was willing to enter into conversation when the recitation was over, but Ward hastened out of the room and gave him no opportunity. The truth was he was so troubled by Jack\u0027s manner that he was afraid he would give in to him and in his anger he had resolved not to do that. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he opened the door into his room, his anger, knew no bounds when again he discovered that the room was in confusion. Twice during the rest of that week the same thing occurred, and both Ward and Henry were desperate. Something must be done. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mike,\" said Ward sharply to the janitor, whom he met alone in the hall on Friday afternoon, \"our room is stacked every day and you\u0027re no good as a watch. I believe some one has taken the key to my room from your ring. Look and see, will you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The \"professor of dust and ashes\" fumbled at the huge bunch he carried, and very much crestfallen at last said, \"Indade and yer right, Mister Ward. The key\u0027s not here at all, at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I thought. Now see if \u0027twenty-three\u0027 is gone too.\" Twenty-three was the number of Little Pond\u0027s room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be jabbers and that\u0027s gone too. Ye\u0027ll not be after tellin\u0027 the principal, will yez?\" said Mike anxiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll see about that later. Mike, can you put a new lock on my door and on Pond\u0027s this afternoon? I mean while we\u0027re here and no one will see you at the work?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indade, and I can that,\" replied the anxious janitor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, do it then right away. I\u0027ve got a plan for catching the rascals and I want the new lock on right off. If you can do that now, it will help me and I sha\u0027n\u0027t have to see the doctor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mike departed and returned with two new locks, which he at once placed on the doors, Ward meanwhile keeping watch to see that the work of the janitor was not discovered, and cautioning him about keeping his duplicate key. \\n\\n \\n\\n With a feeling of elation, Ward at once prepared to put his newly formed plan into execution. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1607/47645.html","bookId":1250,"book":{"id":1250,"title":"Ward Hill the Senior","description":"简介： A school has been very correctly termed a little world of itself.
