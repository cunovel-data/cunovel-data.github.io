At times their laughter could have been heard far up the street, for Jack Hobart was not one to permit quiet long to reign where he was. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward\u0027s father and mother, who had not remained with the boys after they saw that the conversation had turned to school topics, were none the less rejoiced at the change which the coming of Jack wrought in their boy. His laugh was the merriest of the three, and for a time it seemed as if the gloom which had rested over Ward all summer long had disappeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard from lots of the fellows,\" Jack was saying, \"and I can tell you we\u0027re going to have the best year at Weston we have ever seen. Why, even Tim Pickard is coming back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tim?\" said Henry quickly, \"Why, I thought he had been expelled and never could come back again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Tim\u0027s made it all up with Dr. Gray. He\u0027s seen the error of his ways and wants to turn over a new leaf. He\u0027s promised all sorts of things and has been studying hard with a tutor. I really think Tim means what he says too. He\u0027s not such a bad fellow, you know, after all. He\u0027s had too much money and his mother\u0027s dead, you know, and so there was no one to look after him besides his father, and he was too much interested in stocks and things to give any attention to his own flesh and blood. I believe he has written some such stuff to the doctor and promises to do his part too in looking after Tim. He\u0027s even said he\u0027d see to it that Tim shall have only a dollar a week for spending money. Poor Tim!\" added Jack with a laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If he\u0027ll only keep it up,\" said Henry soberly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, if he\u0027ll only keep it up,\" repeated Jack. \"That\u0027s the rub, I know. Tim means what he says now; no doubt about that. He\u0027s even going to take a room alone down at Ma Perrins\u0027, so that he\u0027ll be out of the way of temptation and me.\" And Jack\u0027s merry laugh rang out at the words. \"Honestly, I don\u0027t know about his holding out though. I have my own opinion about that, but I don\u0027t mean to prophesy evil of any fellow. And then Tim\u0027s going to have some things in his favor you must remember. For example, he\u0027ll be out from under the influence of your humble servant, and that\u0027s no small thing, I\u0027d have you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A silence for a brief time followed Jack\u0027s words. Ward felt that Jack in his words about Tim Pickard was really taking that means to inform him of some of the problems which would face him upon his return to Weston. That is, if he should return, for Ward was not yet decided as to what he would do. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tim Pickard had been his most bitter enemy. Even now he could see his coarse face and hear his brutal laugh. Could he ever go back and face him? The very peacefulness of Rockford came out just then the stronger by way of contrast with the difficulties he would have to face in the school. The croaking of the distant frogs rose on the air, the fireflies were flitting about in the yard, and the soft mellow light of the moon was beginning to appear. It was the very perfection of quiet and peace. Here there were no \"Tangs,\" no Tim Pickards, no enmities and jealousies; while the presence of his father and mother seemed to him like a shield from everything that was evil. It was so much more easy to keep out of trouble in Rockford than it was in Weston. And yet Ward knew that both his father and mother were intensely eager for him to return to the school and redeem himself. Which was better for him, to go back and face all the possible temptations and difficulties of the school life, or to remain where he was and be free from them all? In his heart Ward knew the answer. To remain in Rockford would be virtually playing the part of a coward. He would not have to meet and struggle with certain forms of evil there, but it would be a confession that he was afraid. He would lose more than he would gain, there could be no doubt as to that, but the struggle to decide was no easy matter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward Hill had not yet learned the lesson that whether we do right or wrong depends far more upon ourselves than upon our surroundings. He might remain away from all his troubles, and yet he would also stay away from all that would aid him also. At first Ward had pleaded that he might be permitted to go to some other school, but his father had been firm upon that point. He had told Ward that he would do his utmost and his best for him, but if the lad wished to go on with his studies it must be at Weston and no other place for the coming year. And Ward had realized the justice and truth of his father\u0027s demand, and had hot again urged his request. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say, fellows,\" said Jack, breaking in upon the silence, \"whom do you suppose I saw this summer?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t imagine,\" said Henry. \"Perhaps it was Big Smith.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good guess, Henry. It was that same and no other. Yes, sir; I was with my family up in the country, and it seems it was right where Big Smith lived, but I\u0027d forgotten all about it, if I ever knew. Well, one day I was walking down the street of the city--it\u0027s a place about the size of Rockford, you know--and there I came upon his majesty as big as life, yes, as big as Big Smith. He made a great time over me, beat Ward\u0027s reception all to pieces, if he did have all the fatted calves in the country out to greet me upon my arrival.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Was he the same at home that he was in Western?\" inquired Ward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, just the same, only different. He had the same pompous way with him, but I tell you, fellows, Big Smith isn\u0027t so bad after all. He\u0027s just one of those chaps that\u0027s been spoiled by living in a little place, where everybody thought he was a great man because he\u0027d once been away to school. He\u0027d never had a fair chance to size himself up, so to speak, and when he got with a crowd of fellows he didn\u0027t know just what to make of it when they didn\u0027t all fall down before him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack suddenly stopped, realizing then for the first time what he had said. Both of his companions were from a little place too, which he had just declared was not unlike Big Smith\u0027s home. Perhaps they too had suffered somewhat from the same cause which had brought about Big Smith\u0027s unpopularity. Ward, at least, realized in a measure the truth of Jack\u0027s words as applied to himself, and he felt his cheeks burn. But the dusk hid him from the sight of his companions and he said nothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know, of course, you fellows,\" said Jack, striving to break a part of the force of his own words, as he felt rather than saw that an unfortunate turn in the conversation had arisen, \"that I don\u0027t mean that Big Smith\u0027s ever had any such homes as you have. He\u0027s had all the disadvantages without the advantages you have here, and you have all the advantages without his disadvantages. I don\u0027t think you fellows half appreciate what you\u0027ve got here. But Big Smith\u0027s a horse of another color. And yet I never saw such a change come over a fellow in my life as there has in him. I couldn\u0027t hardly believe my own ears when I heard him talk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, what did he say?\" said Ward quietly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, he told me about a talk he had with Mr. Crane before he left Weston, or it may have been a talk Mr. Crane had with him--I\u0027m not sure which it was. It seems that Mr. Crane sent for him and they had a long confab. Mr. Crane got him to talking about himself, and finally led him on until he had expressed his opinion about some of the other fellows too. Finally, after he\u0027d told of some things one of the other boys had done, Mr. Crane turned to him and said in that abrupt way of his, \u0027Smith, that fellow is making a fool of himself, isn\u0027t he?\u0027 Big Smith fell into the trap and I can hear his graveyard voice as he said, \u0027Yes, he is, and a big one too.\u0027 Upon that Mr. Crane jumped up out of his chair and looking Big Smith squarely in the face said, \u0027Well, Smith, that\u0027s just what you are doing too!\u0027 And then he turned and walked straight out of the room. Big Smith laughed while he was telling me all about it, and said he was never cut up about anything so in all his life, but he\u0027d been thinking of it all summer, and had about made up his mind that Mr. Crane had the right of it. Why, fellows, I almost gasped for breath. Think of Big Smith getting off anything like that. It doesn\u0027t seem possible to me even now. Why, if Big Smith can reform there\u0027s a chance for Tim Pickard, and there must be for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then he\u0027s going back to Weston, is he?\" inquired Henry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir, and he says he\u0027s going to make Ward and you just bestir yourselves or he will come up to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That won\u0027t be very much of a task, so far as I\u0027m concerned,\" said Henry; \"but if he overtakes Ward, he\u0027ll have to rise somewhat earlier in the morning than he has been accustomed to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ward said nothing. He was thinking of that conversation Jack had reported as having taken place between Big Smith and Mr. Crane. Perhaps he himself was the very one of whom Big Smith had made the remark that he had \u0027been making a fool of himself.\u0027 And it was true; that was the worst thing about it. He had played the fool, for a lad of any brains at all would never have done as he had, he thought bitterly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you see Pond? You know he lives in the same place in which Big Smith does,\" said Henry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I didn\u0027t see him,\" replied Jack; \"but I hear he\u0027s off working somewhere. At least that\u0027s what Big Smith said. I hope he\u0027ll come back; he\u0027s one of the very best fellows in the Weston school.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That he is,\" said Ward eagerly; \"but he\u0027s not coming back before Christmas, if he does then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not? Have you heard from him?\" inquired Jack. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, he\u0027s written me two or three times. He\u0027s the only fellow I\u0027ve heard from, except Jack here and Mr. Crane, though he isn\u0027t exactly a fellow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes he is. Mr. Crane\u0027s one of the best fellows I ever met, if he does call me up and set me down hard in the Latin room,\" said Jack with a laugh. \"What did Pond write you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He wrote me that he\u0027d have to stay out for the first term and try to earn some money. His younger brother is coming though.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That will be Big Pond and Little Pond then,\" said Jack. \"I wonder whether the fresh Pond is as good a ball player as Big Pond is? We want to fix the Burrs this fall.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s as much good as that,\" said Ward, \"because his brother has written me that he\u0027s a slight, delicate little chap, and he wants me to take him under my wing till he himself comes back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t be under better, my boy, couldn\u0027t be under better,\" said Jack. \"But I don\u0027t want his coming to interfere with one of the plans I\u0027ve made.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" inquired Ward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, I want you to room with me. You see, I\u0027ll be left all alone now that Tim\u0027s going down to Ma Perrins. I need your feathers to cover me a good deal more than Little Pond ever could.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack spoke eagerly and his strong desire was clearly apparent in his words. Ward was deeply touched, but after a brief hesitation, he said slowly: \"No, Jack, I can\u0027t do it. I hope you don\u0027t feel hurt, or think it\u0027s because I don\u0027t want to. But I\u0027ve been thinking it all over, as we\u0027ve been sitting here. At first I didn\u0027t see how I could go back to Weston, anyhow. I thought I\u0027d go up just to pass my examinations and clear up last year\u0027s work, but since you\u0027ve been talking here I\u0027ve decided to go back, and pitch into the work and do my level best.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good for you, Ward Hill!\" said Jack eagerly, springing up from the steps of the piazza upon which he had been seated, and slapping his friend delightedly upon the back. \"Good for you! Why, do you know that\u0027s just what I came up here for? I was so afraid you weren\u0027t going to come that I just couldn\u0027t stand it, so I put straight for Rockford. Of course I\u0027m sorry you aren\u0027t willing to room with your humble servant, though I don\u0027t know as I can find it in my heart to blame you for that. The other thing\u0027s so good though, that I\u0027m not going to shed a tear. We\u0027ll do up the Burrs in fine style now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hear me out,\" said Ward quietly. \"I think I\u0027d better go straight back just as I was, and if Henry here doesn\u0027t mind, I\u0027d like to go in with him and take the same old room in West Hall and make a fresh start. If Henry doesn\u0027t feel like doing that, that will change matters a bit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m only too glad to do it,\" said Henry warmly. He said nothing about Ward\u0027s declining Jack\u0027s offer for he thought he understood exactly how he felt about it. He was so rejoiced over Ward\u0027s decision to return that he was eager to do all in his power to aid him now. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That fixes it, then,\" said Jack enthusiastically. \"Come, fellows, let\u0027s let off one of the school yells!\" The three arose and gave the Weston cheer together. \\n\\n \\n\\n The noise brought Ward\u0027s father and mother to the door, and as they appeared Jack shouted: \"Ward\u0027s going back with us, Mrs. Hill! He\u0027s going to room with Henry and we\u0027ll whip the Burrs and lead the class and do all sorts of things!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Hill household was a happy one that night. Ward\u0027s decision had wonderfully pleased his father and mother, and he himself was surprised at the relief which had come to him. Better than ever before he realized that it meant a severe struggle for him, but the present weight at least was lifted from his heart, and in the joy which comes from facing and overcoming a difficult problem, Ward Hill was happier than he had been for many weeks past. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the following day the three boys had a sail on the bay, and then the \"afternoon train\" carried Jack out of Rockford. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never mind fattening up any more calves for me!\" he called from his place on the rear platform of the last car. \"It\u0027s all right and I\u0027ll see you in a few days at Weston!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two weeks later, just as the sun disappeared behind the western hills, Ward and Henry alighted from the coach in Weston as it stopped before the entrance to West Hall, and running lightly up the stairway, soon entered \"seventeen,\" the same room in which they had begun their experiences of the preceding year. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1607/47639.html","bookId":1250,"book":{"id":1250,"title":"Ward Hill the Senior","description":"简介： A school has been very correctly termed a little world of itself.
