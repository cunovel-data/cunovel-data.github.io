{"id":42442,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX","content":"JACK\u0027S SERMON \"I don\u0027t just know that I understand what you mean,\" said Big Smith slowly. \"Isn\u0027t doing right the same as not doing wrong? That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been taught, that a good fellow was one who didn\u0027t drink and swear and steal.\" \"You\u0027ve got the cart before the horse, my distinguished friend,\" replied Jack. \"A fellow isn\u0027t good because he doesn\u0027t do those things, but he doesn\u0027t do them because he is good. Now I know a place where there are more than a thousand men living all together. They neither drink, swear, nor steal; they don\u0027t even fight. Not one of them.\" \"That must be a fine community, Jack,\" said Big Smith quickly. \"Well, it isn\u0027t. It\u0027s one of the toughest places \u0027in all this broad land of ours,\u0027 to quote from Ward\u0027s last speech. Not much. I don\u0027t think you, even you, Big Smith, would like it there, even with all the virtues I have mentioned, and they\u0027re not half of them, let me tell you, either. I could give you a catalogue more than a yard long, just like them.\" \"I don\u0027t see, Jack. I think you must be joking. What\u0027s the place?\" \"Never was more serious in all my life,\" replied Jack lightly. \"Now listen, and I\u0027ll give you the name of the place. It\u0027s the State prison.\" Big Smith looked blankly at Jack for a moment, while all the other boys present burst into a loud laugh. It was not so much what Jack had said as the expression of amazement which spread over Big Smith\u0027s face as he heard the words. The laughter of the boys continued for several minutes, and at last Big Smith said slowly: \"I never in all my life before thought of it in that way, Jack. Up where I live, when they speak of a good boy they always mean one who doesn\u0027t do anything bad.\" \"And right they are,\" said Jack, with a laugh; \"that is, right as far as they go. The only trouble is they don\u0027t go far enough. Any old pumpkin out in the field doesn\u0027t do any of these things either, but they don\u0027t call the pumpkin \u0027good\u0027 on that account, at least as far as I\u0027ve ever observed. Did you ever go to a circus, Big Smith?\" \"I never did.\" \"Well, that\u0027s all right; I\u0027m not telling you you ought to. All I mean is that if you should happen to go some time, just to take the children, you know, of course, you\u0027d probably see a lot of cages there. And the cages would be full of awful beasts. Wild animals, you know. There\u0027d be the hyena, he\u0027s a very cheerful bird; and there\u0027d be the rhinoceros, and the elephant, and the tiger, and the mosquito, and the lion, and all sorts of gr-o-w-ling, savage beasts of the field,\" and Jack\u0027s voice became low as if he were trying to imitate the sounds of the animals he named. \"Now, Big Smith, if you ever were so naughty as to take the children to see such sights, you\u0027d feel perfectly safe, because not one of those monsters was ever known to devour a man, woman, or even one of the children, for whose sake you probably had gone. You see they\u0027re held back by the bars, and they can\u0027t do any damage, no matter how tempting your tender flesh might appear to be. But, Big Smith, honestly, you wouldn\u0027t feel any warmer toward the gentle hyena, or the mild and smiling tiger, would you? or think it any safer to leave those tender little infants you had gotten together, and for whose sake alone you had gone to the circus--I mean just to see the animals, of course--there in the tent, if the bars were all taken away, although not one of those animals had ever done any damage to any man?\" \"I--I--don\u0027t just see the point,\" said Big Smith, somewhat bewildered. \"What do you mean?\" \"Alas! alas!\" said Jack in mock despair. \"Well, what I mean is just this. You don\u0027t trust a lion or a tiger in the menagerie because he hasn\u0027t done any harm. So you don\u0027t always take to a fellow just because he\u0027s never done anything very bad, either. He may be held back, he may be afraid, he may not know anything about the bad, and so not do it because he doesn\u0027t know enough to do it. Now, Ned Butler, who graduated last year, you know, or Little Puddle\u0027s big brother, why either or both of those fellows just gripped the whole school, you see. They never were in any of the mean things, but there was something besides that. They tried not only not to do wrong, but they also tried to do right. Every fellow in the school knew that both of those boys were just doing their level best to do the square thing every time, as well as keep out of the mean things. It wasn\u0027t half so much what they did not do as what they did do that counted, let me tell you. They had good, red blood in their veins every time, and the boys knew and felt it too, but it seemed just as if they used every ounce of muscle they had to do something. They weren\u0027t thinking of the things they didn\u0027t do.\" \"I--I--think I\u0027m beginning to see what you mean,\" said Big Smith quietly. \"I\u0027m mighty glad you are able to see the point once in your life,\" said Jack good-naturedly. \"You\u0027d better be glad,\" interrupted Ward, who sympathized somewhat with Big Smith in his manifest trouble, \"you\u0027d better be glad that you were able to make the point plain enough to be seen for once in your life, Jack, as I\u0027ve told you so many times lately.\" The lad laughed heartily, for he was one of the few boys who was willing to receive as well as give the bantering of the school. Turning again to Big Smith, and noting the unusual seriousness of his manner he said, in a far more gentle tone than he had before used, \"Honestly, Big Smith, I didn\u0027t mean to hurt your feelings. You started the thing you know, and asked me what I thought was the reason you didn\u0027t stand better with the fellows, and I told you just what I thought. It was none of my business, and I ought not to have done it. Who am I to preach to you? I\u0027m one of those who do just exactly the opposite of the very thing I\u0027ve been urging on you, for I leave undone those things which I ought to have done, and do the things which I ought not to do. Forgive me if I\u0027ve said what I ought not to have said,\" and Jack, in his impulsive way, stretched forth his hand. Big Smith took it, but made no reply, and in a few moments slipped quietly out of the room. As soon as he was gone Jack began to upbraid himself for the words he had spoken, and in a brief time he too departed. None of the boys ever knew of the visit he immediately made in Big Smith\u0027s room, nor did they ever hear of the long conversation between the two boys which followed. It was soon evident, however, that a change of some kind was coming over Big Smith. Many of his ways were greatly modified, and his devotion to Jack Hobart became as marked as it was strange. None of the boys, however, thought very much of the matter, for Jack was universally popular, and no one could long retain a grudge against him, and to that fact was probably attributed the new departure in the case of Big Smith. Pond returned to the school on the following week, and great was the rejoicing among his friends. The boy had but little money, and while in his calm, quiet way he never concealed the fact nor hesitated to give it as a reason for not entering into many of the projects of his companions, he never obtruded it nor referred to his poverty as if he gloried in it. He was one of the most popular boys in the Weston school, thoroughly respected and warmly loved for his genuine manliness. He had continued his studies during his absence, and had been able to keep well up with his class, and as soon as he returned Ward at once perceived that Pond was determined to retain the laurels he had won in the preceding year if hard work would accomplish it. It soon became manifest that the struggle for the first place in the class lay between Ward, Pond, and Berry, but the three boys lost none of their regard for one another in the contest. Ward learned more easily than either of the other two, but he lacked the steady, dogged, even ways of Pond. There were occasions when he was strongly tempted to neglect his work, and indeed did even neglect it, but not for a long time. He had been taught a severe lesson, and with the higher impulses now in his heart, and the longing to carry home to his father a report which he was well aware would give him higher pleasure than anything else he could do for him, he held himself well to his work in the main, and was recognized as one of the leaders in his class. In the even lines of the school work there came many pleasant breaks. On Mountain Day the summit of the great hill was climbed as it had been in the preceding year by the most of the boys of the Weston school, and many of the experiences which have already been recorded were repeated. The party of friends, with Little Pond and Big Smith occasionally added, tramped over the hills in quest of chestnuts, and never failed to return with a goodly store. On the brief half-holidays, until the snow came, they would take their luncheons and start forth to explore some of the beauties of the region in which Weston lay, and the hills would echo and re-echo with the sounds of healthful boyish shouts and laughter, the best sounds in all this world. Ward Hill was happy. The past seldom rose before him now, or if it did come for a moment and awaken a sharp pang, it was soon put aside as the consciousness of the efforts he was then making came to take its place. And Ward was working faithfully. He was doing so much more and so much better than ever he had done before, that it seemed to him as if he was working intensely. He had yet to learn some of the necessities and possibilities in that line. The enmity of Tim Pickard and the \"Tangs\" still continued, but for the most part it was expressed in sneers and attempted slights rather than by any open manifestations; but Ward felt that he could endure all that easily now in the knowledge he had of the regard with which most of the boys looked up to him since the day of the great game with the Burrs. And then too, he had the satisfaction of knowing that he was not neglecting his work, and that results were already becoming more and more plain. Once, it is true, his room was \"stacked\" again, when he had carelessly left the door unlocked, but he did not care so much for that as he did that Pond\u0027s room was also upset on the same day. Coming up the stairs together they discovered two of the younger boys at work in very midst of the mischief. They administered a sound \"seniorly\" spanking, and made the little fellows confess that Tim Pickard had told them to do what they were doing. As soon as the chastening and some good advice had been given, Pond insisted upon going at once to Tim\u0027s room and \"having it out with him\" as he expressed it. Nothing loth, Ward assented, and the two boys at once went down to Mrs. Perrins\u0027 and found Tim by chance in his room. The presence of his visitors evidently confused the lad at first, but soon assuming a bold manner he listened to what Pond had to say. \"We\u0027ve come down here to tell you, Tim, that you\u0027re not to set any more of the little fellows up to stacking our rooms again.\" \"I haven\u0027t stacked your rooms,\" said Tim boldly. \"I\u0027m not talking about that,\" said Pond, speaking in a quiet manner, frequently deceiving to those who were not well acquainted with him. He was seldom angry, but his very quietness gave the impression that it would not be wise to push him unduly. \"I\u0027m not talking about that,\" repeated Pond. \"All I said was that you were not to set any more of the little fellows up to such tricks as stacking our rooms.\" \"Have the little imps gone and squealed? I\u0027ll fix----\" \"Now look here, Tim,\" said Pond, still speaking quietly, and his manner betrayed no excitement, \"you know me and I know you. There isn\u0027t any use in dodging this thing. Ward and I caught the little fellows right in the act, and we spanked them till we made them own up. It wasn\u0027t their fault but ours if they told, and it wasn\u0027t their fault that they were in such petty business, either. I don\u0027t think they will be in it again.\" \"What\u0027ll you do to stop it?\" sneered Tim. \"Go and tell the doctor, won\u0027t you?\" \"I\u0027m not making any threats,\" replied Pond; \"all I\u0027m saying is that this has got to stop. You can\u0027t afford to do it, Tim, and as for me, it costs me too much to come up here to have anybody rob me of what I came for. I haven\u0027t any time to spend in setting up my room. I need all the time I can get to hold my place in the class,\" and he turned and smiled slightly at Ward as he spoke. \"Now you know, Tim, what I\u0027ve come for, and that\u0027s all there is to it. I\u0027m after the work, and I haven\u0027t a spark of the nonsense some of the fellows talk about, putting up with all sorts of tricks, to call them by no worse names, that any one may feel disposed to play on them. That\u0027s what I came for, and now I\u0027ve said all I have to say. Good-night, Tim.\" Tim did not reply to the salutation as Ward and Pond turned and went out of the room. At the door they met Jack, who had just come down for his supper, and to him Ward related all that Pond had said and done. Jack whistled when he had heard all and said, \"That\u0027s what you may call bearding the lion in his den. Maybe it will work all right and maybe it won\u0027t. They won\u0027t bother you again till after Christmas, but my opinion is that you\u0027ll have to look out then.\" \"What\u0027ll he do? Why will he wait until after Christmas?\" said Ward. \"Nobody knows what he\u0027ll do; it won\u0027t be stacking your room, though, I\u0027m thinking. I think he won\u0027t dare to stir things up before that time, for he knows he\u0027s on his good behavior himself; but it\u0027ll come somehow, I\u0027m sure, for Tim\u0027s fighting mad.\" Jack\u0027s prophecy, so far as nothing being done before Christmas, proved to be correct. Nothing occurred to disturb the quiet and harmony of the school. The little flurries of snow were soon followed by heavier falls, and the wintry winds began to be heard throughout the valley. The crests of the hills were the first to be covered by the snow, but soon it crept down the sides and over the meadows, and when at last the end of the term had come, the snow lay deep over all the landscape, one of the heaviest falls ever known in Weston, even the oldest inhabitants declared. Of Ward\u0027s welcome home, of the good time he had, and the happiness which this time was his, we cannot write here. When his report came, Ward found that he was third in his class. He knew then that both Pond and Berry must be in advance of him, and he felt somewhat disappointed. The pride and rejoicing of his father over the improvement, however, were so great, and as Ward himself was aware that he had done good work, he did not refer to his own feelings, but he resolved none the less that he would try to show both Pond and Berry that in the coming term if they held their laurels it would be only by the strongest kind of effort. The \"coming term,\" however, was to be an unusual one even in the annals of the Weston school, but Ward\u0027s heart was light, and not a shadow of the future at this time darkened it. The vacation at last was ended, and Ward and Henry departed from Rockford in the midst of a severe snowstorm. The storm changed to rain before they arrived at the end of their journey, and that night there was a sharp freeze. In the morning, when they left their room to go to their breakfast, they found that the crust of the snow was strong enough to bear their weight, and in every direction they could see the boys running, sliding, slipping, falling over the smooth surface, while all the time shouts and laughter could be heard on every side.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1607/47656.html","bookId":1250,"book":{"id":1250,"title":"Ward Hill the Senior","description":"简介： A school has been very correctly termed a little world of itself.
