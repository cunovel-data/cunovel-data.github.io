In the fall, while each boy was aware that a long stretch of weeks intervened between him and the joyous Christmas time when he would again be at home, there were yet the re-unions after the long vacation, and the formation of new friendships as well as the renewal of the old ones; there was the excitement of the outdoor athletic sports, and the long tramps over the hills and through the valleys, to say nothing of the Mountain Day, which was one of the features of school life at Weston. \n \n In the spring, in addition to the fact that the term itself was a brief one, there was also all the joy which the returning summer brought, and the thought of a speedy return home. \n \n But the winter term was long and sometimes dreary. Storms swept over the valley, the fierce winds piled the heavy fall of snow into mountain-like drifts, and there was not very much to vary the monotony of the school life. It was the time when the hardest work was demanded and done, and the natural consequence was that as the Weston boys came thronging back to the school after the Christmas vacation time more than one of them returned with hearts that were somewhat heavy within them. \n \n But all the boys had a dread of even the appearance of homesickness, and by every available method each sought to create the impression that he at least was not suffering from that dreaded disease. \n \n Just why this was so, no one could explain. Surely no boy had any cause to feel ashamed of his love for his home and his desire to look again upon the faces of those whom he loved and those who loved him. But whatever the explanation, or lack of explanation, it was still true that many of the boys looked forward with anything but pleasure to the days of the winter term, and yet few were willing to acknowledge their feelings. \n \n Ward Hill was no exception to the general rule at Weston. As he came out of the dining hall that evening and the cold, wintry air struck him full in the face, he lifted his eyes and looked at the snow-clad hills which shut in the valley. The towering monarchs seemed to be absolutely pitiless and forlorn in the starlight. Snow and leafless trees, and cold and lifeless landscapes seemed to be all about him and even the laughter of the boys sounded noisy and unnatural, as if his boisterous companions either were striving to drown their thoughts by their protests, or were endeavoring to force themselves into some kind of a belief that they really were glad to be back together in school again. \n \n He was sharing in the general depression, and in addition to his desire to see Jack was the longing to be cheered, and perhaps compelled to forget the immediate pressure by the contagious and irresistible good nature of his friend. \n \n Henry gladly yielded assent and in a few moments they entered Jack\u0027s room and had received his somewhat noisy welcome. Berry also was there, and Pond and his brother came a little later, and in the presence of such friends Ward\u0027s gloomy thoughts soon vanished. \n \n \"And how are all the good people at Rockford?\" said Jack eagerly. \"That\u0027s the best town I ever was in in my life. I don\u0027t see why they need any churches or preachers there for my part; a fellow has to make a desperate effort if he wants to do anything bad there.\" \n \n Ward smiled at Jack\u0027s words as he replied to his question. He thought he might be able to explain to his friend that even Rockford was not free from all temptations, but Jack soon broke in again. \n \n \"If I didn\u0027t want Pond here to come to New York and take charge of the church I attend just as soon as he\u0027s ready to begin to preach, I\u0027d say to him go up to Rockford. They are awfully good up there.\" \n \n \"Yes, some of us \u0027too good to be true,\u0027 I\u0027m afraid,\" said Ward quietly. \n \n \"You don\u0027t suppose I\u0027m going to a place where I\u0027d have nothing to do but loaf, do you?\" protested Pond. \"No sir! I\u0027m going to a place where there\u0027s work, and plenty of it too.\" \n \n Ward glanced quickly at Henry and noticed the pained expression upon his face at Pond\u0027s innocent reference to the position of a preacher in Rockford. He was well aware of the almost passionate devotion with which Henry regarded his father, and indeed the feeling was somewhat shared by Ward himself as he pictured to himself even then the saintly beautiful face of Dr. Boyd. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know about that, Pond,\" he said quickly. \"My impression is that Henry\u0027s father doesn\u0027t think he\u0027s lying in a bed of roses with such a scapegrace as I am to look after. I rather think it depends upon the man almost as much as it does upon the place he\u0027s in whether he works or not.\" \n \n \"That isn\u0027t what I mean,\" said Pond, perceiving at once that he had said something which might better have been left unsaid. \"I know there\u0027s work even in Rockford, and there\u0027s a worker for the work too. I was only speaking for myself, and what I meant was that the place where there\u0027s the most to be done is the one which appeals most to me.\" \n \n \"Good for you, Pond,\" said Jack hastily. \"My church is the place for you. The men there think if they give lots of money, and pay a good big salary to the preacher they\u0027ve done all that\u0027s required of them. But honestly I\u0027m most afraid the missionary part was left out of me. I like a good time. And fellows,\" he hastily added, \"I\u0027ve brought something back with me just for that very purpose. I got one and Tim Pickard\u0027s got one too. He brought his up on the same train with me.\" \n \n \"What\u0027s that you\u0027ve got?\" said Ward, voicing the immediate interest of all in the room. \n \n \"I\u0027ve the daintiest bob you ever saw. Come out in the hall and see it.\" \n \n The boys followed the eager lad, and there in the hall stood the long sled which Jack had brought. It was shod with slender steel runners, and in its narrowness appeared to be even longer than it really was. It was beautifully upholstered and equipped with the most approved steering apparatus. \n \n \"Isn\u0027t she a beauty?\" said Jack enthusiastically. \"I wouldn\u0027t dare tell you what my father paid for her. I just hinted that I wanted the best affair in all the city, and behold! just before I started for the train, this bob put in an appearance.\" \n \n The enthusiasm of the boys was almost equal to that of the sled\u0027s owner, as they noted its good points and examined it critically. \n \n \"We\u0027ll have some fun on her,\" said Jack. \"She\u0027s like an arrow almost. What is it we sing in chapel, \u0027Swift as an arrow cleaves the air\u0027? Well, that\u0027s what this bob can do. She\u0027s a good ten feet in length, and I think she won\u0027t tarry very long on her way down West Hill, do you?\" \n \n \"How many will she carry, Jack?\" inquired Ward. \n \n \"All I can put on her. I can pack away ten or twelve, and maybe more. We\u0027ll soon see. Come up on West Hill to-morrow afternoon after study hour, will you, fellows?\" \n \n All the boys eagerly accepted the invitation, and on the following afternoon joined Jack and together dragged the long, slender bob up West Hill. \n \n West Hill was a long hill with several bends in the road and a number of very sharp descents, between which were long stretches where the road ran downward, but in a gradual incline. From the place where the boys at last stopped, to the street on which the school buildings stood it was at least a mile, and they were all eager to see in what time the new bob could carry them that distance. \n \n The pathway was almost like ice, for the cold weather still continued and the recent sharp freeze had left a hard coating over all the snow. When at last the party of seven boys halted, for both Big and Little Smith had joined them, they were far above the valley. The trees had a coating of frost and glistened in the afternoon sunlight. The pathway was hard and firm and did not yield beneath their weight. The air was crisp, but the boys were clothed to meet that and no one thought of the cold. \n \n \"Get ready there!\" shouted Jack, as he took his seat in front on the sled and grasped the little ropes by which he was to steer. He braced his feet against the ice to hold the sled in its position and waited for the boys to take their positions behind him. \n \n One after another took his place on the sled, carefully bracing his feet and grasping the body of the boy in front of him tightly with both arms. Ward was to have the position in the rear and was to give the push which should start them on their long journey. \n \n \"All ready?\" shouted Ward taking his place. \n \n \"All ready! Let her go!\" shouted Jack in reply. \n \n Ward began to push, and as the sled began to move slowly gave it one more hard shove and it had started. Then running swiftly behind it he leaped quickly upon it, braced his feet and tightly grasped Henry, who was seated next before him. \n \n The sled began to move slowly at first, but in a moment its speed increased and soon it seemed to the excited boys as if they were almost flying over the smooth and slippery surface. Faster and faster sped the long sled and the sharp air seemed almost to cut their faces like a knife. \n \n Down the long descent the sled swept on and soon came to the first of the sharp falls. It seemed then almost to leap from the ground and shoot through the air, as indeed it did for a number of feet, then struck the ground and swept onward with an ever-increasing speed. \n \n Ward thought of Jack\u0027s reference to the arrow cleaving the air, and it seemed as if that was just what the swift-flying sled was doing. \n \n On and on, swifter and swifter sped the party. Around one of the bends in the road they passed, and the boys clung more tightly to one another, for it seemed at first as if they would be flung from their places; but Jack was doing nobly as steersman and held his beloved sled well to its place in the road. Down another of the sharp descents they passed and the speed was again increased. It seemed as if nothing could move more swiftly than they were sweeping down the long hillside. The vision of the fences by the roadside and of the few scattered farmhouses and barns was all confused and indistinct so rapidly did they pass. Down, down, and ever downward sped the sled, and the excitement of the breathless boys increased each moment. \n \n Another of the bends in the road lay before them, and almost before they were aware of it they were sweeping around the curve, and before them lay the last of the sharp falls in the road. \n \n As they turned the bend a loud warning cry burst from Jack\u0027s lips, and as the frightened boys glanced quickly before them, they had an indistinct vision of another party of boys coming up the hill dragging a long bob behind them. The warning cry was heard just in time, and the startled boys only succeeded in swiftly leaping to one side before Jack\u0027s sled was upon them. It just grazed the edge of the other sled, and then before any one could utter a word was yards away down the hillside. Not one of the boys spoke, but their faces were white and drawn, and the peril they had barely escaped caused their hearts to beat wildly. \n \n Again the sled seemed to leap and shoot through the air as it came to the last fall, and swift as its motion had been before, it became even swifter now. The fences and trees seemed to fly past them. It was even difficult to breathe in the cold and rushing air. On and on swept the sled with its load, until at last the long road had been traversed and they approached the little hill which was near the village. \n \n Up the ascent the sled plunged on its way, then down the hillside on the farther side, then up again on its way to the last of the rises in the ground before they approached the school buildings. \n \n But the upward movement now began to tell even on the swiftly flying bob and its speed visibly slackened. Slowly and still more slowly it moved, and when at last it had gained the high ground on which West Hall stood it came to a standstill. \n \n With a heavy sigh the boys leaped off and stood together facing Jack, who was holding the ropes by which he had steered, in his hand. \n \n \"Whew!\" said Jack enthusiastically. \"That\u0027s what I call coasting, fellows!\" \n \n \"Coasting!\" said Ward. \"That isn\u0027t any name for it. That\u0027s flying, that\u0027s what it is--just flying. I feel as if we\u0027d been shot through the air and didn\u0027t, even touch the ground. I say, Jack, I\u0027ve got a name for your bob.\" \n \n \"What is it?\" \n \n \"\u0027The Arrow.\u0027 ,\u0027Swift as an arrow cleaves the air,\u0027 you know. You can\u0027t improve on that name if you try ten years. Call her \u0027The Arrow,\u0027 Jack.\" \n \n \"All right,\" said Jack laughingly in reply. \"\u0027The Arrow\u0027 it is then. I\u0027ll have her all painted up in colors in a day or two. Come on, fellows, and we\u0027ll try it again.\" \n \n The boys turned to follow Jack up West Hill again; but no one spoke for a time, as the excitement following the swift ride had not yet disappeared. \n \n Ward was walking by Jack\u0027s side assisting in dragging the sled, and when they were half-way up the hillside they quickly called to their companions to \"look out,\" and then swiftly darted to one side of the road drawing the long sled with them. Just before them they could see the other bob coming swiftly on its way, and as it swept past them they discovered that Tim Pickard was steering it. Doubtless it was his bob, and the party consisted of his boon companions. \n \n \"I say, Jack,\" said Ward soberly, \"this is lots of fun, but it\u0027s dangerous too. You don\u0027t suppose Tim would leave his bob so that we might happen to strike it on our way down, do you? It would be all day with us if he should do such a thing.\" \n \n \"No, I don\u0027t believe Tim would do that,\" replied Jack lightly, although Ward thought he could see that his friend was troubled by the suggestion. \"No, I don\u0027t believe Tim would do that,\" repeated Jack. \"He\u0027s got the disposition to upset us, but I don\u0027t believe he\u0027d do it. He thinks too much of his bob to run the risk of a collision.\" \n \n Nothing more was said by either of the boys, and in a brief time they arrived at the summit of West Hill and prepared once more for the long ride. \n \n The party was arranged just as it had been in the preceding ride, and as soon as Ward saw that all the boys were ready, he began again to push the heavy load and as the sled started, he ran lightly behind it and then leaped upon it in his former position. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1607/47657.html","bookId":1250,"book":{"id":1250,"title":"Ward Hill the Senior","description":"简介： A school has been very correctly termed a little world of itself.
