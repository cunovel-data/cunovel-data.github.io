But William and Tamara have formidable allies in Lord Byron, Queen Bodicea, and Lord Admiral Nelson–England’s noble, notorious Ghosts of Albion. Responding to a plea from Cornwall, Tamara discovers that the rumors of young women, both human and fairy, vanishing without a trace are horribly true. Instead of hard clues, she uncovers only whispers of witches, infernal abductions, and a pyre of innocents planned for the solstice. Indeed, Tamara has never faced a more dangerous task–for the legendary land of King Arthur’s Camelot also harbors dark, bloody deeds and a waking evil. Soon nothing, not even mighty Albion, will be safe from the deadly peril.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/witchery-a-ghosts-of-albion-novel-ghosts-of-albion-2.jpg","author":"Amber Benson","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/witchery-a-ghosts-of-albion-novel-ghosts-of-albion-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:43 PM"}},{"id":97819,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/witchery-a-ghosts-of-albion-novel-ghosts-of-albion-2/page-21.html","bookId":2604,"book":{"id":2604,"title":"Witchery: A Ghosts of Albion Novel (Ghosts of Albion #2)","description":"Storyline: Witchery: A Ghosts of Albion Novel (Ghosts of Albion #2) William and Tamara Swift’s newfound sorcerous powers as Protectors of Albion pale before the demonic forces threatening Britannia.
