{"id":2604,"title":"Witchery: A Ghosts of Albion Novel (Ghosts of Albion #2)","description":"Storyline: Witchery: A Ghosts of Albion Novel (Ghosts of Albion #2) William and Tamara Swift’s newfound sorcerous powers as Protectors of Albion pale before the demonic forces threatening Britannia. But William and Tamara have formidable allies in Lord Byron, Queen Bodicea, and Lord Admiral Nelson–England’s noble, notorious Ghosts of Albion. Responding to a plea from Cornwall, Tamara discovers that the rumors of young women, both human and fairy, vanishing without a trace are horribly true. Instead of hard clues, she uncovers only whispers of witches, infernal abductions, and a pyre of innocents planned for the solstice. Indeed, Tamara has never faced a more dangerous task–for the legendary land of King Arthur’s Camelot also harbors dark, bloody deeds and a waking evil. Soon nothing, not even mighty Albion, will be safe from the deadly peril.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/witchery-a-ghosts-of-albion-novel-ghosts-of-albion-2.jpg","author":"Amber Benson","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":23,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
