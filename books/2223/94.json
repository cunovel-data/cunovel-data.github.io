Norman, how’s the shoulder?” Norman had been sitting in a chair near the door. He was standing now, his arm held in a white sling over his dark blue suit coat. “No need to get up, I won’t be staying long,” I said. Norman didn’t sit down. He looked like he wanted to attack me. One thing you had to say about him, he was a gamer. There was plenty of muttering. Someone wanted to know who the hell I thought I was. Muehlenhaus raised a fragile hand and silenced the table. “Gentlemen, I apologize for interrupting your meeting,” I said. “However, I think you should know that I am going to vote for John Allen Barrett. I am going to contribute money to his campaign. If I find the time, I’ll even deliver campaign literature door to door. Unless he’s weak on crime—an issue that’s suddenly become quite important to me—I can think of no reason why he shouldn’t be elected U.S. senator from the state of Minnesota. Maybe even president.” Troy Donovan was on his feet. He looked like he wanted to say something. I didn’t give him the opportunity. “There was a slight problem involving Mr. Barrett’s wife that might have become an impediment to his campaign,” I said. “However, I believe it has been satisfactorily rectified.” Donovan sat down slowly. “What problem was that?” Muehlenhaus asked. “Good morning, gentlemen,” I said and left the room. I retreated from the office along the same path I had come. When I reached the lobby I was stopped by the woman with the smart brown eyes that I had met, God, was it only a week ago? “Mr. Muehlenhaus would like to speak with you,” she said. “He’s coming now.” “He’s coming to me?” “Yes.” That I wanted to see. While I waited, I examined the Degas. I decided I understood the ballerina a little bit better than the first time I had encountered her. A moment later, Muehlenhaus arrived. He offered his hand and I shook it. I was surprised by the strength of his grip. “You did an excellent job in Victoria,” he said. “I didn’t do it for you.” “Nonetheless, we are very pleased.” “Makes you wish you hadn’t tried to kill me, doesn’t it?” I spoke loud enough for at least a half dozen people to hear me, yet no one behaved as if they had. “I was wondering, Mr. McKenzie. How would you like to do a favor for me?” You can guess what I told him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3/page-94.html","bookId":2223,"book":{"id":2223,"title":"Pretty Girl Gone (Mac McKenzie #3)","description":"Storyline: Rushmore \"Mac\" McKenzie has a lot of old girlfriends, but only one went on to marry the current governor of the state of Minnesota. And only one is calling him with a desperate request to meet in secret. First Lady Lindsay Barrett is carrying an anonymous e-mail that contains the makings of an ugly rumor about her husband, the man about to run for higher office---perhaps even the highest office. Someone says they have evidence that Jack Barrett killed his high school sweetheart. Lindsay says it\u0027s an outright lie, but the truth lies buried decades in the past in the small town where the governor grew up. Of course, Mac, who\u0027s richer than he needs to be and always has plenty of time on his hands, is in the business of handling such matters for his friends. So he packs up and drives straight into the governor\u0027s past with the brilliantly conceived plan to poke around and see if he can stir up a little information. He\u0027s soon got goons of all sorts poking him back, including a nasty little group of political movers and shakers who aren\u0027t above kidnapping and murder to protect their interests. It\u0027s clear that his little plan has stirred up nothing but trouble. With no choice but to stick to it, he continues shifting through a complex web of interlocking secrets and lies, some decades old and some rooted violently in the present day. It\u0027s up to Mac to sort truth from untruth before a vicious rumor becomes a political nightmare---or worse, before the \"outright lie\" is proved a solid, irrefutable fact.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3.jpg","author":"David Housewright","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:58 PM"}}
