I glanced about. No one was looking at us. I guessed that Axelrod’s patrons were used to his outbursts.\\n\\n “Jack left the party,” I said.\\n\\n “Yep.\\n\\n “Then you and the others left.”\\n\\n “Yep.”\\n\\n “Sometime after that, Beth left.”\\n\\n “I guess.”\\n\\n “That’s all you know?”\\n\\n “That’s it.”\\n\\n “Were you ever questioned by the Chief?”\\n\\n “Chief Bohlig? No, why would I be?”\\n\\n Before I could answer, a man appeared just inside Nick’s heavy wooden door. His hair was parted crookedly and in need of shampoo. His complexion looked blotchy under a two-day growth of beard, and while he was clearly underweight, he was as doughy as unbaked bread.\\n\\n “Nick,” he brayed, suddenly the loudest man in the restaurant. “You no-good sonuvabitch.”\\n\\n “Hey, Josie, how are ya, man?” Axelrod called out. His voice was still loud and cheerful, but something had changed. There was an edge to it that hadn’t been there before.\\n\\n “I need a drink,” Bloom announced, scratching first his hands and then his cheeks.\\n\\n “You look like you’ve already had plenty, partner,” Axelrod said. I agreed. Bloom seemed like a man who had been to hell and back and remembered every step of the journey.\\n\\n “What’re you, my mother?” Bloom said. “A drink. Rye.”\\n\\n “How ’bout something to eat first. We’ve got a great special tonight. Jace,” Axelrod called.\\n\\n A moment later the young woman was standing there with her pencil and pad.\\n\\n “Good evening, Mr. Bloom,” she said. “What can I get you? The special?”\\n\\n “Hey, hey, hey,” Bloom chanted. He stopping scratching long enough to wrap an arm around Jace and hug her shoulder. I don’t know why I was annoyed by the gesture, but I was.\\n\\n “Judith Catherine,” Bloom said. “How’s my sweetheart?”\\n\\n “Just great,” Jace replied.\\n\\n “Atta girl.”\\n\\n “How ’bout that special?” Jace asked.\\n\\n “If’n that’s the only way I’m gonna get a drink in this dump, yeah, why not?”\\n\\n “Sure thing, Mr. Bloom. Good to see you again.”\\n\\n She patted Bloom’s arm and smiled before turning toward the kitchen.\\n\\n “Hi, Mr. Bloom.” I extended my hand. “I’m McKenzie.”\\n\\n He looked at my hand as though I had offered him the dirty end of the stick.\\n\\n “Who the hell is he?” he wanted Axelrod to tell him.\\n\\n “McKenzie’s been asking about the Seven,” Axelrod explained.\\n\\n Bloom grinned, but there was nothing friendly about it. Maybe it was the teeth, I told myself. They were a ghastly shade of gray and his gums were bright red.\\n\\n “Fuck the Seven,” he said. “Where’s the restroom? Hell, I know where the restroom is.”\\n\\n Bloom spun in the direction of the kitchen and staggered away.\\n\\n “Charming,” I said.\\n\\n “Ah, that’s just Josie,” Axelrod said. “He’s all right. It’s just—I told you about Coach and the tournament? Same with Josie. Winning the championship was the highlight of his life. Ever since God’s dealt him nothing but slop.”\\n\\n “Why would God do that?”\\n\\n “Who knows why God does half the things He does? I’ll tell ya, He’s sure been good to Jack though, huh?”\\n\\n I remembered something my Dad used to tell me—“God helps those who help themselves”—but didn’t mention it.\\n\\n “It’s this place, this town,” Axelrod said. “Josie should live in the Cities, Mankato; live where people don’t know or care that he stole the ball with eight seconds left on the clock and passed it to Jack so Jack could win the game at the buzzer. Only he can’t seem to get away.\\n\\n “I’ve been told he suffers from what psychologists call dual diagnosis depression, meaning he’s not only clinically depressed, he self-medicates himself with alcohol, which makes it worse. Another guy, he told me Josie suffers from biological unhappiness, whatever that means. I think it’s just that he’s been unable to deal with the terrible fact that his life, his entire existence has been defined by something he did when he was only seventeen years old.”\\n\\n “What’s he do for a living?” I asked. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3/page-51.html","bookId":2223,"book":{"id":2223,"title":"Pretty Girl Gone (Mac McKenzie #3)","description":"Storyline: Rushmore \"Mac\" McKenzie has a lot of old girlfriends, but only one went on to marry the current governor of the state of Minnesota. And only one is calling him with a desperate request to meet in secret. First Lady Lindsay Barrett is carrying an anonymous e-mail that contains the makings of an ugly rumor about her husband, the man about to run for higher office---perhaps even the highest office. Someone says they have evidence that Jack Barrett killed his high school sweetheart. Lindsay says it\u0027s an outright lie, but the truth lies buried decades in the past in the small town where the governor grew up. \\n Of course, Mac, who\u0027s richer than he needs to be and always has plenty of time on his hands, is in the business of handling such matters for his friends. So he packs up and drives straight into the governor\u0027s past with the brilliantly conceived plan to poke around and see if he can stir up a little information. He\u0027s soon got goons of all sorts poking him back, including a nasty little group of political movers and shakers who aren\u0027t above kidnapping and murder to protect their interests. It\u0027s clear that his little plan has stirred up nothing but trouble. \\n With no choice but to stick to it, he continues shifting through a complex web of interlocking secrets and lies, some decades old and some rooted violently in the present day. It\u0027s up to Mac to sort truth from untruth before a vicious rumor becomes a political nightmare---or worse, before the \"outright lie\" is proved a solid, irrefutable fact.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3.jpg","author":"David Housewright","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:58 PM"}}
