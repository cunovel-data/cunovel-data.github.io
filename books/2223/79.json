The best I could come up with was “You have nothing to fear from me.” “Shut up.” “See about Tapia,” I said. Mallinger rushed to the front door of Fit to Print. Jace was kneeling next to Tapia’s body, hugging his shoulders and weeping. He was still holding the carton on his lap. Mallinger took the place mats out of Tapia’s hands and set them aside. She opened Tapia’s jacket to examine his wounds. Only there were no wounds. I watched as Mallinger sat back on her heels and contemplated the carton. She turned it in her hands. The bullets had gone in one side, but not out the other. She spun back to Tapia. She checked his pulse and smiled broadly. She began gently patting the back of his hands. Gradually, Tapia opened his eyes. “What happened?” he said. More statements. It seemed like I was making a lot of them lately, this time to Mallinger, an impossibly young county attorney, and a Nicholas County deputy with chevrons on his sleeve. With both Jace and Tapia backing me up, it was decided that I had probably not committed a crime, but I could be sure that all the parties involved would investigate thoroughly before they returned my gun. As Mallinger put it, “This used to be a nice, quiet town before you arrived, McKenzie.” I carefully explained that the man who shot at us—whom I most likely shot in return, in case they wanted to check neighboring hospitals and emergency rooms—was named Norman—“I don’t know if that’s his first or last name”—and he was employed by Mr. Muehlenhaus of Minneapolis. Neither Mallinger nor the deputy tumbled to his name. But the eyes of the young county attorney grew wide and shiny. I knew phone calls would be made. I doubted that Norman would ever be found, much less arrested. Kevin Salisbury, on the scene with his ubiquitous camera, had arrived before anyone else. He took photographs of Tapia, Fit to Print, the carton of place mats, Mallinger, the deputy and county attorney, assorted officers, me, and Jace—at least a half roll. Everyone gave him a statement but me. He was upset about that and reminded me that we had an agreement. I gave him a wink and a smile and brought my index finger to my lips in the universal sign of conspiracy. He whispered, “I’ll talk to you later.” Eventually, Salisbury, the attorney, and the deputy left me alone in the parking lot of Fit to Print with Mallinger. The kids had been whisked off to Nick’s by Axelrod, where, he assured Tapia, a cure for whatever ailed him could and would be found. I would have liked to go with them, but I wasn’t invited. I was cold and wet with slush and Mallinger asked me, “Are you satisfied?” “Satisfied?” “Do you have what you came here for?” “Yes. Yes, I do.” “So you’ll be leaving us soon.” Mallinger allowed me to take her hand in mine and bring it to my lips. I kissed her middle knuckle. “I’m sorry I complicated your life,” I said. “I’m a big girl. I can deal.” “He didn’t do it.” “Who didn’t?” “Barrett. He didn’t kill Elizabeth Rogers. Chief Bohlig and the Seven and the rest of Victoria—everyone jumped to a conclusion thirty years ago, and so did I this morning.” “You think he’s innocent?” I nodded. “Why?” “Two reasons. First, Jack didn’t have a car. How could he have dumped Elizabeth’s body along the county road if he didn’t have a car?” “An accomplice?” “That would suggest premeditation and we know there couldn’t have been.” “That’s thin, McKenzie. What’s the second reason?” “The second is a lot more conclusive. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you. Not unless it is absolutely essential and it isn’t because . . .” “Because Barrett will never be charged, right?” “Right.” “You don’t want to embarrass the governor if you don’t have to.” “That pretty much covers it.” “Whatever it is that you know, it can’t possible be worse than the rumor that he killed a girl.” “Sure it can.” “How?” “Because it’s not a rumor. Listen, I just wanted you to know that Barrett is innocent.” “So it doesn’t haunt me that he got away with murder.” “I like you, Danny.” “I like you, too, McKenzie.” “I’m sorry about everything that’s happened.” “I’m not. At least not about everything.” “I’d kiss you if we weren’t in public—a nice, long, noncomforting kiss, if you get my drift.” “Maybe I should put the cuffs back on and drag you off to a holding cell.” “Maybe you should.” “McKenzie, if the governor didn’t kill Beth, who did?” “I have some ideas about that.” “Feel free to share.” “What are you doing for dinner, tonight?” “That depends. Am I going to be in uniform?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3/page-79.html","bookId":2223,"book":{"id":2223,"title":"Pretty Girl Gone (Mac McKenzie #3)","description":"Storyline: Rushmore \"Mac\" McKenzie has a lot of old girlfriends, but only one went on to marry the current governor of the state of Minnesota. And only one is calling him with a desperate request to meet in secret. First Lady Lindsay Barrett is carrying an anonymous e-mail that contains the makings of an ugly rumor about her husband, the man about to run for higher office---perhaps even the highest office. Someone says they have evidence that Jack Barrett killed his high school sweetheart. Lindsay says it\u0027s an outright lie, but the truth lies buried decades in the past in the small town where the governor grew up. Of course, Mac, who\u0027s richer than he needs to be and always has plenty of time on his hands, is in the business of handling such matters for his friends. So he packs up and drives straight into the governor\u0027s past with the brilliantly conceived plan to poke around and see if he can stir up a little information. He\u0027s soon got goons of all sorts poking him back, including a nasty little group of political movers and shakers who aren\u0027t above kidnapping and murder to protect their interests. It\u0027s clear that his little plan has stirred up nothing but trouble. With no choice but to stick to it, he continues shifting through a complex web of interlocking secrets and lies, some decades old and some rooted violently in the present day. It\u0027s up to Mac to sort truth from untruth before a vicious rumor becomes a political nightmare---or worse, before the \"outright lie\" is proved a solid, irrefutable fact.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3.jpg","author":"David Housewright","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:58 PM"}}
