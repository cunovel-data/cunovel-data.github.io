{"id":31962,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"The man whom Humphrey feared most, in those early days, was Rivers, the news-editor. His personality was a riddle. You were never certain when you were summoned to his room in the morning, whether good or ill would result from it. In his hands lay the ordering of your day. You had no more control over your liberty from the time you came into Rivers\u0027 room than a prisoner serving his sentence,—no longer a man with a soul, but a reporter. You could be raised into the highest heaven or dropped down to the deepest hell by the wish of Rivers. He could bid you go forth—and you would have to tramp wretchedly the streets of the most unlovely spots in outer London in an interminable search for some elusive news: or perhaps you would be given five pounds for expenses and told to catch the next train for a far county, and spend the day among the hedgerows of the country-side. He had power absolute, like the taskmasters of old. \n \n He sat in his room, with the map of England on the wall with its red flags marking the towns where The Day had correspondents, surrounded by telephones and cuttings from papers. He was in the office all day and night. At least that was how it appeared to Humphrey, who met him often and at all times on the stairs. When he was not, by any chance, there, his place was taken by O\u0027Brien, an excitable Irishman, whose tie worked itself gradually up his collar, marking the time when his excitement was at fever-heat like a barometer. \n \n Rivers had a home, of course, and a wife and a family. He was domesticated somewhere out in Herne Hill, from[89] the hours of eight until ten-thirty in the morning; and except once a week no more was seen of him at home. O\u0027Brien generally took the desk on Sundays. But for the rest of his life Rivers lived and breathed with The Day more than any one else. From the time the door closed on him after breakfast, to the time when it closed on him late at night, when he went home, worn-out and tired, he worked for The Day. He was bought as surely as any slave was bought in the days of bondage. And his price was a magnificent one of four figures. \n \n He expected his men to do as he did, in the service of the paper. For his goodwill, nothing sufficed but the complete subservience of all other interests to the work of The Day. Not until you did that, were you worthy to be on the paper and serve him.... And many hearts were broken in that room, with its hopeless gospel of materialism, where ideals were withered and nothing spiritual could survive. \n \n Rivers was one of the young men who had won himself to power by the brute force of his intellect. He knew his own business to the tips of his fingers, and, beyond that, nothing mattered. Art and literature and the finer qualities of life could not enter into the practical range of his vision. They were not news. The great halfpenny public cared for nothing but news—a murder mystery, for choice; and the only chance art or literature had of awaking his interest was for the artist to commit suicide in extraordinary circumstances, or for the novelist to murder his publisher. (\"By George!\" I can hear Rivers saying, \"here\u0027s a ripping story.... Here\u0027s an author murdered his publisher ... \u0027m ... \u0027m ... I suppose it\u0027s justifiable homicide.\") \n \n But on news—red-hot news—he was splendid. He might be sitting in his chair, joking idly with anybody who happened to be in the room, and suddenly the boy would bring in a slip from the tape machine: a submarine[90] wreck! Immediately, the listless, joking man would become swiftly serious and grim. He would decide instantly on the choice of reporters—two should be sent to the scene. \"Boy, bring the A.B.C. No train. Damn it, why didn\u0027t that kid bring the news in at once. He dawdled five minutes. We could have caught the 3.42. Well, look up the trains to Southampton. Four o\u0027clock. O\u0027Brien, telephone up Southampton and tell them to have a car to take The Day reporters on. Boy, ask Mr Wratten and Mr Pride to come up. O\u0027Brien, send a wire to the local chaps—tell \u0027em to weigh in all they can. Notify the post-office five thousand words from Portsmouth. Too late for photographs to-night—ring through to the artists, we\u0027ll have a diagram and a map. Off Southsea, eh? Shove in a picture of Southsea....\" And in an hour it would all be over, and Rivers, a new man with news stirring in the world, would playfully punch O\u0027Brien in the chest, and gather about him a reporter or two for company, and bestow wonderful largesse in the shape of steaks and champagne. That was the human thing about Rivers. He was master absolute, and yet there was no sharp dividing line between him and the men under him. The discipline was there, but it was never obtruded. They drank, and joked, and scored off each other, and Rivers, when things were slack, would tell them some of his early adventures, but whenever it came to the test, his authority in his sphere was supreme. He knew how to get the best work out of his men; and, I think, sometimes, he was sorry for the men who had not, and never would get, a salary of four figures. \n \n Humphrey could not understand him. At times he would be brutally cruel, and morose, scarcely speaking a word to anybody except Wratten, who was generally in his good books; at other times he would come to the office as light-hearted as a child, and urge them all into[91] good-humour, and make them feel that there was no life in the world equal to theirs. Since that day when Humphrey had first met him in Ferrol\u0027s room, and he had laughed and said, \"You\u0027re not a genius, are you?\" Rivers had not taken any particular notice of him. When he came into Rivers\u0027 room, halting and nervous, he envied the easy freedom of the other reporters who chanced to be there. Wratten sitting on a table, dangling his legs, and Tommy Pride, with his hat on the back of his head, and a pipe in his mouth, while a third man might be looking over the diary of the day\u0027s events. \n \n \"Hullo, Quain....\" \n \n \"Good-morning, Mr Rivers.\" \n \n \"O\u0027Brien, what have you got for Quain. Eh? Nothing yet. Go downstairs and wait.\" \n \n Or else: \"Nothing doing this morning. You\u0027d better do this lecture at seven o\u0027clock. Give him the ticket, O\u0027Brien.\" \n \n And, as Humphrey left the room, he heard Wratten say casually, \"I\u0027ll do that Guildhall luncheon to-day, Rivers, eh?\" And Rivers replied, \"Right-O. We shall want a column.\" \n \n Splendid Wratten, he thought! How long would it be before he acquired such ease, such sure familiarity—how long before he should prove himself worthy to dangle his legs freely in the presence of Rivers. \n \n Within a few days something happened that made Humphrey the celebrity of a day in the reporters\u0027 room. It was a fluke, a happy chance, as most of the good things in life are. A man had killed himself in a London street under most peculiar circumstances. He had dressed himself in woman\u0027s clothes, and only, after death, when they took him to the hospital, did they find that the dead body was that of a man. He was employed in a solicitor\u0027s office near Charing Cross Road. His name was Bellowes, and he was married, and[92] lived at Surbiton. These facts were published briefly in the afternoon papers. Rivers, scenting a mystery, threw his interest into the story. There is nothing like a mystery for selling the paper. He sent for Willoughby. \n \n Humphrey had found Willoughby one of the most astonishing individuals of the reporters\u0027 room. He was a tall, slim man, with a hollow-cheeked face and a forehead that was always frowning. His hair fell in disorder almost over his eyebrows, and whenever he wrote he pulled his hair about with his left hand, and mumbled the sentences as he wrote them. His speciality was crime: he knew more of the dark underside of human nature than any one Humphrey had met. He knew the intimate byways of crime, and its motives; every detective in the Criminal Investigation Department was his friend, and though by the rigid law of Scotland Yard they were forbidden to give information, he could chat with them, make his own deductions as well as any detective, and sometimes accompany them when an arrest was expected. He drew his information from unknown sources, and he was always bringing the exclusive news of some crime or other to The Day. \n \n He was a bundle of nerves, for he lived always in a world of expectancy. At any moment, any hour, day and night, something would be brought to light. Murder and sudden death and mystery formed the horizon of his thoughts. \n \n Humphrey had found a friend in Willoughby. In very contrast to the work in which he was engaged, he kept the room alive with merriment. He could relate stories as well as he could write them, and he spoke always with the set phrases of old-time journalism that had a ludicrous effect on his listeners. His character was a strange mixture of shrewdness, worldly-wisdom, and ingenuousness, and this was reflected in the books he carried always with him. In one pocket there would[93] be an untranslatable French novel, and, in the other, by way of counterblast, a Meredith or a Stevenson. He and Humphrey had often talked about books, and Willoughby showed the temperament of a cultured scholar and a philosopher when he discussed literature. \n \n Willoughby went up to Rivers\u0027 room. \n \n \"Here you are, my son,\" said Rivers, tossing him over the cuttings on the affair of the strange suicide. \"Get down to Surbiton and see if you can nose out anything. I\u0027ll get some one else to look after the London end.\" \n \n The some one else chanced to be Humphrey, for there was nobody but him left in the reporters\u0027 room. Thus it came about that, a few minutes after Willoughby had set out for Surbiton, Humphrey came out on Fleet Street with instructions to look after the \"London end\" of the tragedy. \n \n Rivers\u0027 parting words were ringing in his ears. They had a sinister meaning in them. \"... And don\u0027t you fall down, young man,\" he had said, using the vivid journalistic metaphor for failure. \n \n The busy people of the street surged about him, as he stood still for a moment trying to think where he should begin on the London end. He felt extraordinarily inexperienced and helpless.... He thought how Wratten would have known at once where to go, or how easily Tommy Pride, with his years of training, could do the job. He did not dare ask Rivers to teach him his business—he had enough common sense to know that, at any cost, his ignorance must be hidden under a mask of wisdom. \n \n The reporter thrust suddenly face to face with a mystery that must be unravelled in a few hours is a fit subject for tragedy. He is a social outlaw. He has not the authority of the detective, and none of the secret information of a department at his hand. He is a trespasser[94] in private places, a Peeping Tom, with his eye to a chink in the shuttered lives of others. His inner self wrenches both ways; he loathes and loves his duty. The human man in him says, \"This is a shocking tragedy!\" The journalist subconsciously murmurs, \"This will be a column at least.\" Tears, and broken hearts, and the dismal tragedy of it all pass like a picture before him, and leave him unmoved. \n \n The public stones him for obeying their desires. He would gladly give up all this sorry business ... and perhaps his salvation lies in his own hand if he becomes sufficiently strong and bold to cry \"Enough!\" \n \n And this is the tragedy of it—he is neither strong nor bold; and so we may appreciate the picture of Humphrey Quain faced for the first time with the crisis that comes into every journalist\u0027s life, when his work revolts his finer senses. \n \n He went blindly up the street, and newsboys ran towards him with raucous shouts, offering the latest news of the suicide. He bought a copy, and read through the story. It occurred to him that the best thing he could do was to go to the offices near Charing Cross Road, where the dead man had worked. \n \n He took an omnibus. It was five o\u0027clock in the evening, and most of the passengers were City men going home. Lucky people—their work was finished, and his was not yet begun. \n \n When he came to the building he wanted, he paused outside. It was a ghastly business. What on earth should he say? What right had he to go and ask questions—there would be an inquest. Surely the public could wait till then for the sordid story. It was ghoulish. \n \n He went into the office and asked the young man at the counter whether Mr Parfitt (the name of the partner) was in. The young man must have guessed his business[95] in a moment. Humphrey felt as if he had a placard hanging round his neck, \"I am a newspaper man.\" \"No,\" snapped the young man, curtly, \"he\u0027s out.\" \n \n \"When will he be back?\" asked Humphrey. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" the young man answered, obstinately. \"Who are you from?\" That was a form of insult reserved for special occasions: it implied, you see, that the caller was obviously not of such appearance as to suggest that he was anything but a paid servant. \n \n Humphrey said: \"I wanted to talk about this sad tragedy of—\" \n \n The young man looked him up and down, and said, \"We\u0027ve nothing to say.\" \n \n \"But—\" began Humphrey. \n \n \"We\u0027ve nothing to say.\" The young man\u0027s lips closed tightly together with a grimace of absolute finality. Humphrey hesitated: he knew that the whole mystery lay within the knowledge of this spiteful person, if only he could be overcome. \n \n \"Look here,\" said the young man, threateningly. \"Why don\u0027t you damn reporters mind your own business. You\u0027re the seventh we\u0027ve \u0027ad up \u0027ere. We\u0027ve nothing to say. See?\" His voice rose to a shriller key. He was a very unpleasant young man, but fortunately he dropped his \"h\u0027s,\" which modified, in some strange way, in Humphrey\u0027s mind the effect of his onslaught. The young man who had at first seemed somebody of importance, faded away now merely to an underbred nonentity. Humphrey laughed at him. \n \n \"You might keep your h\u0027s if you can\u0027t keep your temper,\" he said. \n \n Then he left the office, feeling sorry for himself. It was nearly six o\u0027clock, and he was no further. A hall-porter sat reading a paper in front of the fireplace. Humphrey tried diplomacy. He remarked on the tragedy: the hall-porter agreed it was very tragic.[96] There had been seven other reporters before him (marvellous how policemen and hall-porters seemed to know him at once). Humphrey felt in his pocket for half-a-crown and slipped it into the porter\u0027s hand. The porter thanked him with genuine gratitude. \n \n \"Well,\" said Humphrey, \"what sort of a chap was this Mr Bellowes?\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t say as how I ever saw him,\" said the porter; \"this is my first day here.\" \n \n \"O lord!\" groaned Humphrey. \n \n He was in the street again, pondering what he should do. And suddenly that intuitive reasoning power of his began to work. A man who worked in the neighbourhood would conceivably be known to the shopkeepers round about. He visited the shops adjoining the building where the dead man worked, but none of them yielded any information, not even the pawnbrokers. The men whom he asked seemed quite willing to help, but they knew nothing. Finally, he went into the Green Lion public-house which stands at the corner by a court. \n \n Hitherto public-houses had not interested him very much: he went into them rarely, because in Easterham, where every one\u0027s doings were noted, it was considered the first step downwards to be seen going into a public-house. Thus, he had grown up without acquiring the habit of promiscuous drinking. \n \n There were a good many people in the bar, and the briskness of business was marked by the frequent pinging noise of the bell in the patent cash till, as a particularly plain-looking young woman pulled the drawer open to drop money in. Humphrey asked for bottled beer. \"Cannock\u0027s?\" the barmaid asked. \"Please.\" She gave him the drink. He said \"Thank you.\" She said \"Thank you.\" She gave him the change, and said \"Thank you\" again. Whereupon, in accordance with our polite[97] custom, he murmured a final \"\u0027Kyou.\" Then she went away with an airy greeting to some fresh customer. \n \n Presently she came back to where Humphrey was standing. He plunged boldly. \n \n \"Sad business this of Mr Bellowes?\" he ventured, taking a gulp at his beer. She raised her eyebrows in inquiry. \n \n \"Haven\u0027t you read about—\" he held a crumpled evening paper in his hand. \"The tragedy, I mean.\" \n \n \"Oh yes,\" she said. \"Very sad, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \n A man came between them. \"\u0027Ullo, Polly, lovely weather, don\u0027t it?\" he said, cheerfully, counting out six coppers, and making them into a neat pile on the table. \"Same as usual.\" \n \n \"Now then, Mister Smart!\" said Polly, facetiously, bringing him a glass of whisky. \"All the soda.\" \n \n \"Up to the pretty, please,\" he said, adding \"Whoa-er\" as the soda-water bubbled to the level of the fluted decorations round the glass. Small talk followed, frequently interrupted by fresh arrivals. A quarter of an hour passed. The cheerful man had one more drink, and finally departed, with Polly admonishing him to \"Be good,\" to which he replied, \"I always am.\" Humphrey ordered another Cannock. \n \n \"Did he often come here?\" \n \n \"Who?\" asked Polly. \"Mr Jobling—the man who\u0027s gone out?\" \n \n \"No. I mean Mr Bellowes.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know,\" she said a little distantly. \"Those gentlemen over there\"—nodding to a corner of the bar where two men stood in the shadows—\"can tell you all about him. They were telling me something about him just before you came in. Fourpence, please.\" \n \n Humphrey took with him his glass of beer, and went to the two men. They were both drinking whisky, and[98] they seemed to be in a good humour. They turned at Humphrey\u0027s wavering \"Excuse me....\" \n \n \"Eh?\" said one of the men. \n \n \"Excuse me...\" Humphrey repeated. \"I\u0027m told you knew Mr Bellowes.\" \n \n \"Well,\" said the other man, a little truculently. \"What if we did?\" \n \n It seemed to Humphrey that the most absolute frankness was desirable here. \n \n \"Look here,\" he said, \"I wish you\u0027d help me by telling me something about him. Here\u0027s my card.... I\u0027m on The Day.\" \n \n The younger of the two men smiled, and winked. \"You\u0027ve got a nerve,\" he said. \"Why, you couldn\u0027t print it if we told you.\" \n \n \"Couldn\u0027t I? Well, never mind. Let\u0027s have a drink on it anyway.\" \n \n Humphrey began his third Cannock, and the others drank whisky. One of them, in drinking, spilt a good deal of the liquor over his coat lapel, and did not bother to wipe it off: he was slightly drunk. \n \n \"It\u0027s bringing a bad reputation on the firm,\" said the elder man. \"Name in all the papers.\" \n \n Humphrey was seized with an idea. He knew now that the whole secret of the mystery was within his grasp. One of the men, at least, was from the solicitor\u0027s office. The instinct of the journalist made him courageous: he would never leave the bar until he got the story. \n \n \"I\u0027ll tell you what,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll promise to keep the name of the firm out of The Day; I\u0027ll just refer to it as a firm of solicitors!\" \n \n \"That\u0027s not a bad notion,\" said the younger man. He drew the elder man aside and they talked quietly for a few minutes. Then more drinks were ordered. Humphrey tackled his fourth Cannock. His head was just beginning to ache. \n \n [99] \n \n A tantalizing half-hour passed. The younger man seemed more friendly to Humphrey—he had some friends in Fleet Street; did Humphrey know them, and so on. The elder man was growing more drunk. He swayed a little now. Humphrey\u0027s ears buzzed, and his vision was not so acute. The outlines of people were blurred and indistinct. \"Good lord,\" he murmured to himself, \"I\u0027m getting drunk too.\" He was pleasantly happy, and smiled into his sixth glass of beer. He confided to the elder man that he admired him for his constancy to the dead man, and they began to talk over the bad business as friends. The elder man even called him \"Ol\u0027 chap.\" They really were very affectionate. \n \n \"But WHY did he do it?\" said Humphrey; \"that\u0027s what beats me.\" \n \n \"Oh, well, you see he was in love with this girl ...\" \n \n \"Which girl?\" \n \n \"Why, Miss Sycamore ... you know the little girl that sings, \u0027Come Round and See Me in the Evening,\u0027 in the Pompadour Girl.\" \n \n \"No. Was he?\" \n \n \"Was he not,\" said the elder man, with a hiccough. \"Why, he used to be talking to me all day about her.... And the letters. My word, you should see the letters ... he used to show them to me before he sent them off. Full of high thinking and all that.\" \n \n And gradually the whole story came out, in scattered pieces, that Humphrey saw he could put together into a real-life drama. Never once did he think of the dead man, or the dead man\u0027s wife in Surbiton (Willoughby was probably doing his best there). He only saw the secret drama unfolding itself like a novelist\u0027s plot. The meetings, the letters, the double life of Bellowes, a respectable churchwarden in Surbiton; a libertine in London—and then she threw him over; declined to see him when he called at the stage door; he had[100] dressed himself as a woman, hoping to pass the stage-door keeper. Perhaps if he had got as far as the dressing-room, maddened by the breakage of his love, and the waste of his intrigue, there might have been a double tragedy. And so to the final grotesque death in the street. \n \n It was eight o\u0027clock when Humphrey had the whole story in his mind, and by that time, though he knew he had drunk far too much, he was not so drunk as the other two men. \n \n \"There you are, old boy,\" said the elder man, affectionately. \"You can print it all, and keep my name and the name of the firm out of the papers.\" \n \n \"So long,\" said the younger man, as they parted at the door of the bar. \"You won\u0027t have another.\" \n \n \"I\u0027d better get back now,\" Humphrey replied. \"Thanks awfully. You\u0027ve done me a good turn.\" \n \n He walked back to the office; the late evening papers still bore on their posters the word \"Mystery\"—but he alone of all the people hurrying to and fro knew the key of the mystery. He had set forth a few hours ago—it seemed years—ignorant of everything, and, behold, he had put a finger into the tragedy of three lives. All that feeling of revolt and hatred of his business passed away from him, and left in its place nothing but a great joy that he had succeeded, where he never dreamt success was possible. After this he knew he must be a journalist for ever, a licensed meddler in the affairs of other people. \n \n And so, with his head throbbing, and his legs a little unsteady, he came back to the office of The Day. It was nine o\u0027clock; Rivers had left the office for the night, and O\u0027Brien was out at dinner. He went to Mr Selsey, and told him briefly all he knew. \n \n \"Where did you get it from?\" Selsey asked. \n \n \"From some friends of his; I promised I wouldn\u0027t[101] mention the name of the firm of solicitors he worked in.\" \n \n \"What about Miss Sycamore?\" \n \n \"Miss Sycamore?\" echoed Humphrey, blankly. \n \n \"Yes. Haven\u0027t you got her? We must know what she says. It mayn\u0027t be true.\" \n \n Humphrey\u0027s head swam. He was appalled at the idea of having to go out again, and face the woman in the sordid case. Selsey looked at the clock. \"I\u0027ll send somebody else up to see her—she\u0027s at the Hilarity Theatre, isn\u0027t she? You\u0027d better get on with the main story. Write all you can.\" \n \n He went to the reporters\u0027 room; nobody was there except Wratten, just finishing his work. Humphrey sat down at a desk, and began to write. His brain was whirling with the facts he had learnt; they tumbled over one another, until he did not know how to tell them all. He started to write, and he found that he could not even begin the story. He tore up sheet after sheet in despair. The clock went past the quarter and Humphrey was still staring helplessly at the blank paper. Wratten finished his work and dashed out with his copy to the sub-editor\u0027s room. \n \n \"I\u0027m drunk,\" he said to himself. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s the matter.\" \n \n And later: \"What a fool I was to drink so much.\" \n \n And then, as if in excuse: \"But I shouldn\u0027t have got the story if I hadn\u0027t drunk with them.\" \n \n A boy came to him. \"Mr Selsey says have you got the first sheets of your story.\" \n \n \"Tell him he\u0027ll have them in a few minutes,\" Humphrey said. \n \n And when Wratten came into the room he found Humphrey with his head on his outstretched arms, and his shoulders shaken with his sobbing. \n \n [102] \n \n \"Hullo! What\u0027s up, old man?\" asked Wratten, bending over him. \"Not well?\" \n \n Humphrey lifted a red-eyed face to Wratten. \"I\u0027m drunk,\" he said. \"My head\u0027s awful.\" \n \n \"Bosh!\" Wratten said cheerfully, \"you\u0027re sober enough. Selsey\u0027s delighted you\u0027ve got your story. I suppose it was a hard story to get.\" \n \n Humphrey groaned. \"I can\u0027t write it.... I can\u0027t get even the beginning of it.\" \n \n \"That happens to all of us. I have to begin my story half a dozen times before I get the right one. Look here, let me help you. Tell me as much as you can.\" He touched the bell, and a boy appeared. \"Go and get a cup of black coffee—a large cup, Napoleon,\" he said jovially to the boy, giving him a sixpenny piece. \n \n By the time the coffee had arrived, Humphrey had told Wratten the story. \"By George!\" said Wratten, \"that\u0027s fine! Now, let\u0027s do it between ourselves. Don\u0027t bother about plans. Start right in with the main facts and put them at the top. Always begin with the fact, and tell the story in the first two paragraphs—then you\u0027ve got the rest of the column to play about in.\" \n \n The coffee woke Humphrey up. In a quarter of an hour, with Wratten\u0027s help, the story was well advanced, and Selsey\u0027s boy had gone away with the first slips. Whenever he came to a dead stop, Wratten told him how to continue. \"Wrap it up carefully,\" Wratten said. \"Talk about the dead man\u0027s pure love for anything that was artistic: say that he was a slave to art, and that Miss Sycamore typified art for him. That\u0027ll please her. Say that she never encouraged his attentions, and that realizing life was empty without her, he killed himself. Make it the psychological tragedy of a man in love with an Ideal that he could never attain. And don\u0027t gloat.\" \n \n The story was finished. \"That\u0027s all right,\" Wratten said. \n \n [103] \n \n \"Look here—\" Humphrey began, but something choked his throat. He felt as if Wratten had rescued him from the terror of failure: his glimpse of brotherhood overwhelmed him. \n \n \"Stow it!\" said Wratten, unconcernedly. \"It\u0027s the paper I was thinking of. Well, I\u0027m off. Don\u0027t say a word about it in the morning.\" \n \n And there it was, in the morning, the whole story with glaring headlines, an exclusive story for The Day. Humphrey, riding down Gray\u0027s Inn Road, saw the bills in the shop-windows, and two men in the omnibus were discussing it: his head was dull with the drink of last night, but he felt exhilarated when he thought of it all. He wanted to tell the two men in the omnibus that he had written the story in The Day. He came to the office and the fellows in the reporters\u0027 room seemed as glad as he was. Willoughby told him of his Surbiton adventure, and how Mrs Bellowes declined to see anybody. And when he went into Rivers\u0027 room, the great man smiled and said facetiously, \"Well, young man, I suppose you\u0027re pleased with yourself.\" He winked at Wratten. \"You\u0027ll be editor one day, eh?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s a jolly good story,\" said Wratten, \"the best The Day\u0027s had for a long time.\" \n \n Humphrey smiled weakly. He would have told Rivers just how it came to be such a jolly good story, if Wratten had not frowned meaningly at him. And not until Rivers said: \"Come off that desk, young man, and see what you can do with this—\" handing him a job, did Humphrey realize that he was at ease, dangling his legs with the great ones. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1879/54335.html","bookId":801,"book":{"id":801,"title":"Mightier than the Sword","description":"简介： If you had been standing on a certain cold night in January opposite the great building where The Day is jewelled in electric lights across the dark sky, you would have seen a little, stout man run down the steps of the entrance at the side, three at...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1879","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM"}}
