{"id":31984,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"He did not go to Elizabeth that night: he walked, in a dream, past Knightsbridge and up Piccadilly, contemplating the fulfilment of all his dreams. Everything seemed possible now. He was a young man—and Ferrol was going to give him Paris; he was a young man—and Elizabeth had given him her love. The sequence of this thought was significant. \n \n It would be very fine to tell her.... At last he was lifted out of the rut into a field of new endeavour. From Paris the path led to other cities, of course—to Petersburg, Vienna, and Rome. One day he would see them all. Life became at once very broad and open. \n \n He walked on, an un-noteworthy figure in the throng of people that moved along Piccadilly, his thoughts surging with the prospects of his new life. \n \n \"Humphrey Quain ... Paris Correspondent of The Day.\" \n \n He murmured that to himself. Glorious title! Splendid Ferrol. How noble was this work in Fleet Street, holding out great promises to those who served it well, and sacrificed everything on its altar. How could one abandon a calling where fortune may change in a moment? \n \n He passed through astonishing ranks of women whose eyes and lips simulated love: one or two of them spoke to him in foreign accents. He passed on across the Circus where the lights of the Variety Theatres made a blur of yellow in the nebulous night. \n \n His steps led him again to Fleet Street, and he walked with the joy of a man treading the soil of his own[278] country. It was always the same when he passed the Griffin: deep satisfaction took hold of him at the sight of the signs in all the buildings, telling of newspapers all the world over, in this narrow Street in which the lives of him and his kind were centred. The fascination of the Street was perpetual. It belonged to him. It belonged to all of them. At every hour of the day and night there were always friends to be met. \n \n He turned into the cheery warmth of the Pen Club—friends everywhere and Fleet Street smiling! There was laughter at the wooden counter, where Larkin was telling some story to a group of men. \n \n \"Well, the next day I thought I\u0027d go up and inquire after his lordship\u0027s health. The butler was very kind. \u0027Come in,\u0027 he said. \u0027His lordship\u0027s expecting you.\u0027 So up I went, thinking I was going to get a fine story—he was supposed to be dangerously ill in bed, mind you.\" \n \n Humphrey joined the group and listened. (\"Have a drink?\" said Larkin, turning to him. \"It\u0027s my shout.\") \n \n \"Well,\" continued Larkin, \"when I got to the room, there was his lordship in pants and undervest—you know how fat he is—with dumb-bells in his hands and whirling his arms about like a windmill. \u0027Do I look like a dying man?\u0027 he said, dancing lightly on his toes. \u0027Go back, young man, and tell your editor what you\u0027ve seen. Good-morning.\u0027\" \n \n \"Talking of funny experiences,\" said one of the others, \"I remember—\" And so it went on, story after story, of real things happening in the most extraordinary way. It was all this that Humphrey enjoyed, this inter-change of experiences, this telling of stories that were never written in newspapers, that belonged alone to them. \n \n Presently Tommy Pride came in. \"Hullo all!\" he said, \"Hullo! young Quain—been busy to-day?\" \n \n [279] \n \n They sat down together, and Humphrey noticed that Tommy\u0027s face had changed greatly, even in the last few months. The flesh was loose and colourless, and the eyes had a nervous, wandering look in them. \n \n \"Ferrol\u0027s going to send me to Paris—he told me so to-night,\" Humphrey blurted out. \n \n \"Splendid,\" said Tommy. \"Good for you.\" And then a look of great pathos crept into his eyes, and he seemed to grow very old all at once. \"I wish I had all your chances,\" he said wistfully. \"I wonder what will be the end of me.... I hear they\u0027re making changes.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t you bother,\" Humphrey said. \"Ferrol knows what you\u0027re worth.... But, I say, Tommy, you don\u0027t mind, do you ... aren\u0027t you taking too much of that,\" he pointed to the whisky glass. \n \n \"Oh, hell! What does it matter,\" said Tommy. \"What does anything matter.... I\u0027m a little worried ... they\u0027re thinking of making changes,\" he repeated aimlessly. \n \n It was all settled in a few minutes the next morning. The Paris appointment was definitely confirmed: he was to leave immediately. He hastened to Elizabeth to tell her the wonderful news. It never occurred to him that she could be otherwise than pleased and proud at his success. But her manner was recondite and baffling. \n \n \"Have you accepted the post?\" she asked. \n \n \"Why, of course,\" he said. \"How could I refuse such a chance.\" \n \n She regarded him dubiously. \"No—you could not refuse it. I don\u0027t blame you for not refusing it. I think I know how you feel....\" \n \n \"It\u0027s splendid!\" Humphrey cried. His voice rang with enthusiasm. \"Fancy Ferrol singling me out. It[280] will be the making of me.... It might lead to anything.\" \n \n \"But weren\u0027t you only going to stay in journalism for another year, Humphrey?\" \n \n \"Oh, of course, when I said that, I couldn\u0027t foresee that this was going to happen.... Elizabeth,\" he said suddenly, with a great fear on him, \"do you want me to give it up now?\" \n \n \"No ... no,\" she said in haste. \"You don\u0027t understand. It\u0027s so difficult to make you see. I wasn\u0027t prepared for this....\" She laughed for no reason at all. \"I am glad of your success. I am glad you\u0027re happy.... Of course, you don\u0027t expect me to come to Paris, like this, at a moment\u0027s notice. You must give me time.\" \n \n He smiled with relief. \"Why, of course, I didn\u0027t imagine I could carry you away at once.... But after a few months, perhaps. It will take me a few months to get used to the work.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" she agreed, \"after a few months. We shall see.\" \n \n Her face was strangely sorrowful. Her attitude perplexed him. It hurt him to find that she did not share in his rejoicings. It took away some of the savour of his success. \n \n He thought he was the master of his destiny. He could not discern the hand of Ferrol moving him again towards a crisis in his life. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1879/54357.html","bookId":801,"book":{"id":801,"title":"Mightier than the Sword","description":"简介： If you had been standing on a certain cold night in January opposite the great building where The Day is jewelled in electric lights across the dark sky, you would have seen a little, stout man run down the steps of the entrance at the side, three at...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1879","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM"}}
