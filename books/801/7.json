{"id":31960,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"The memory of that evening at the Prides remained with Humphrey. It was his first glimpse into the social life, and he saw a home that was wholly delightful. Beaver had not under-estimated the hospitality of the Prides. They gave him a hearty welcome that made him feel at home at once. Tommy Pride met them in the passage, and after the first introductions he led the way to the sitting-room, where Mrs Pride was waiting. She was a woman of forty, buxom and charming. He saw, within a very few minutes, that her admiration of Tommy Pride knew no bounds, that she thought him splendid and flawless—that much he read from the way her brown eyes lit up when she gazed upon him, and the fond smile that marked her lips when she spoke to him. The sitting-room was not a very large apartment, but it was furnished with unusual taste. There were books set in white enamelled bookcases—books that are permanent on the shelf, and not novels of a moment. There was chintz on the arm-chairs and green curtains hung over the window, and a few original black-and-white drawings and water-colours on the walls, papered in dark blue. The impression that the room gave to the visitor was one of peace and rest. Humphrey was frankly disappointed in Tommy Pride. He had had a vague notion that everybody connected with a London newspaper was, of necessity, a person of fame. He knew the names of those who signed the articles in The Day, and he imagined he[65] would find himself in the company of the great immortals. Somehow or other it had never crossed his mind that there were patient, toiling men—hundreds of them—who put out their best work day after day, year after year, without any hope of glory or fame, but simply for the necessities of life, as a bricklayer lays bricks—hundreds of men quite unknown outside the bounds of Fleet Street and the inner newspaper world. \"Well,\" Mrs Pride said to him; \"so you\u0027re going to try your luck in London, Mr Quain?\" Humphrey nodded, and the conversation went into the channels of small talk. Beaver and he amused the Prides with recollections of Easterham and Mr Worthing, and Tommy Pride capped their recollections with some of his own. \"When I was on a little local paper once, we had a fellow named Smee, who thought he could write,\" said Tommy. \"The editor was a hard, cruel sort of chap, without any sympathy for the finer side of literature—at least that was what Smee said. He used to sob all round the place, because he wanted to write great throbbing prose instead of borough-council meetings. One day Smee got his chance. The editor was ill, and there was a prisoner to be hanged in the county jail. Smee wrote the effort of his life. It went something in this way:— \"\u0027Last Tuesday, under the blue vault of heaven, when the larks were singing their rhapsodies to the roseate dawn, at 8 A.M., like a sudden harbinger of horror, the black flag fluttered above the prison walls, showing that Alfred Trollop, aged forty-two, labourer, had suffered the last penalty of the law—viz., death.\u0027\" \"How\u0027s that for descriptive?\" asked Tommy, smacking his lips. \"\u0027Viz., death.\u0027 A glorious touch, eh?\" He leaned towards Humphrey. \"Don\u0027t you bother about[66] fine writing, Quain, or you\u0027ll break your heart. We keep a stableful of fine writers, and turn \u0027em loose when we want any high falutin\u0027 done.\" \"Don\u0027t be so depressing, Tommy,\" Mrs Pride said. \"Never mind what he says, Mr Quain—there\u0027s a chance for every one to do his best in Fleet Street.\" \"Dear optimistress,\" remarked Tommy, linking an arm in hers, \"let\u0027s see what we have for supper.\" They all went into the dining-room, and Humphrey was given the place of honour next to Mrs Pride. Beaver sat opposite, and Tommy was at the head of the table carving the joint of cold roast beef. \"I\u0027m a little out of form,\" he said, whimsically. \"This is the first meal I\u0027ve had at home for a week.\" \"I sometimes wish Tommy were a sub-editor,\" Mrs Pride confided to Humphrey; \"then we should at least have the day to ourselves. But he says he could never sit down at a desk for eight hours a night.\" \"Not me,\" Tommy interposed, with his mouth full of beef. \"If they want to make you a sub-editor, Quain, take several grains of cyanide of potassium rather than yield. You\u0027ve got some freedom of thought and life as a reporter, but if you\u0027re a sub you\u0027re chained down with a string of rules. They make you wear a mental uniform.\" \"I thought a sub-editor held a more important position than a reporter,\" Humphrey said. \"So he does, only the reporters don\u0027t think so. The paper couldn\u0027t get on without the sub-editors. I should love to see The Day printed for just one issue with everything that the reporters wrote untouched. It would have to be a forty-two page paper. Because every reporter thinks his story is the best, and writes as much of it as he can.... I like the subs, they\u0027ve saved my life over and over again. Next to the Agency men[67] they\u0027re the most useful people in the world, eh, Beaver?... Have some beer, Beaver. Pass him the jug, Quain.\" Beaver laughed. \"It strikes me you people on the regular staff of the papers take yourselves much too seriously. You\u0027ve all got swelled heads. For the sake of fine phrases you\u0027ll lose half the facts. Why don\u0027t you all understand that it\u0027s simply in the day\u0027s work to do your job and forget all about it.\" \"Lord knows,\" Tommy replied, \"but we don\u0027t. We get obsessed with our jobs, and dream them, and spend hours taking trouble over them, and we know all the time that when they come cold and chilly at night through the sub\u0027s hands, they\u0027re lopped about and cut up to fit a space. We may pretend we don\u0027t care what happens to our writing, so long as we draw our money, but I think we all do in our secret hearts. We\u0027re born that way. The moment a man really doesn\u0027t care whether his story is printed or cut to shreds, he\u0027s no good in a newspaper office. It means he\u0027s lost his enthusiasm.\" Tommy\u0027s voice fell. He knew well enough that that was the state of affairs to which he had come. All the long, long years of work had left him emotionless. He had exhausted his enthusiasm, and the whole business seemed stale to him. He felt out of place in this new world of newspaperdom, peopled with energetic, hopeful young men who came out of nowhere, and captured at once the prizes which were so hardly won in his day. He felt himself being nudged out of it all, by the pushful enthusiastic army of young men who had marched down on Fleet Street. All round him he saw signs of the coming change—the old penny papers were talking of changing their price to a halfpenny; the older men in journalism were being pensioned off, or dismissed, or[68] \"put on space\"—which means that they were not paid a regular salary but at so much a column for what they wrote. The spirit of change was working everywhere: some of the solid writers who found that they could not comply with the modern demands of journalism, migrated back to the provinces and became editors or leader-writers on papers in Manchester, Birmingham or Sheffield. And, at the back of all this change, the figure of Ferrol hovered.... Ferrol sweeping irresistibly over the old traditions of Fleet Street.... Ferrol threatening to acquire this paper and that paper, to start weeklies and monthlies, to extend his power even to the provinces, so that everywhere the shadow brooded. And they would want young men, keen, shrewd young men, and so the day would come when he would fade away from the life of Fleet Street. And then—\"Tommy and I are going to retire soon,\" Mrs Pride said, with a fond glance at her husband, \"aren\u0027t we, Tommy?\" \"She means to the workhouse, Beaver,\" Tommy remarked, with a grin. \"We\u0027re going to have a cottage in the country, and Tommy\u0027s going to write his book.\" \"No,\" said Beaver, incredulously. \"Do you write books, Mr Pride?\" Humphrey asked. \"I? Lord, no! Not now. I once had an idea of writing books. I was just about your age. I believe I\u0027ve even got the first chapter somewhere. But I\u0027ve never written it. Whenever the missis and I get very depressed, we cheer ourselves up by talking of that book, and writing it in the country. By the way, do you know that deep down in the heart of every newspaper man there\u0027s a longing to write one book, and to live on two pounds a week in the country?\" [69] \"That\u0027ll do, Tommy,\" Mrs Pride interposed. \"I won\u0027t have you spoil Mr Quain\u0027s evening any more. You\u0027re making him quite depressed. Don\u0027t pay any attention to him, Mr Quain, and have some cheese.\" After supper they went back to the sitting-room, and Mrs Pride played to them, and Beaver sang in a shaky bass voice. Humphrey had never heard Beaver sing before. There was something grotesque about the singing. It took Humphrey by surprise. Beaver was the sort of man who, somehow or other, one imagined would sing in a high treble. He sang on and on, right through the portfolio of the \"World\u0027s Favourite Songs,\" including \"The Anchor\u0027s Weighed,\" \"John Peel,\" \"The Heart Bowed Down,\" and the rest of them. Pride sat in the arm-chair by the fireside, smoking a pipe, and nodding to the old melodies, while Humphrey gravitated to the book-shelves, and looked at some of the books. He seemed to have left Easterham and his aunt far behind him in dim ages. A new feeling of responsibility came over him, as he sat there thinking of the morrow when his battle with Fleet Street was to begin. The future rested with him alone, and it gave him a delicious thrill of individuality to think of it. It was as if he had suddenly become merged with some one else within him, who was constantly saying to him: \"You are Humphrey Quain.... You are Humphrey Quain. Take charge of yourself now.... I have finished with you.\" He had an odd sense of not fully knowing this strange new Self with which he was faced. He wondered, too, whether Beaver or Pride had ever passed through the same sensation that was passing through him now. This was the beginning of that introspection when the presence of his Self became[70] dominant in his mind, shaping as something to be looked at and examined and questioned, that was to lead to much bitterness and unhappiness in the years to come. The evening came to an end, but before they left Pride took Humphrey aside. \"Beaver said you might like a few hints,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t think I can help you much. I think you know your way about. But there are two important things to remember: Don\u0027t be a genius, and don\u0027t be a fool. I\u0027ll tell you more in the morning.\" On the way back to Guilford Street Beaver eulogized Pride. He was one of the best reporters in Fleet Street—one of the safest, Beaver meant. Never let his paper down. Worth his salary on any paper. \"I suppose he gets a pretty big salary?\" Humphrey asked. \"Who? Pride—no! I don\u0027t think he gets very much. He\u0027s not a show man, you see. Of course, dear old Tommy hasn\u0027t got a cent to spare. He\u0027s got a girl of thirteen at boarding-school, and that takes a good bit of keeping up.\" \"Why was he so discouraging?\" \"Oh! that\u0027s his way. He pretends he\u0027s a pessimist.\" Humphrey went to bed that night full of thoughts of the morning. And in the tumult of his thoughts he wondered how he should avoid becoming as Tommy Pride, with all his thirty years of work as nothing, and all the high ambitions sacrificed to Fleet Street. Was that to be his end too—a reporter for ever, and at the finish of it, nothing but the husks of enthusiasm. He thought of Pride\u0027s wistful desire for a cottage in the country and two pounds a week. And he fell asleep while thinking how he was going to find a better end to his work than that.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1879/54333.html","bookId":801,"book":{"id":801,"title":"Mightier than the Sword","description":"简介： If you had been standing on a certain cold night in January opposite the great building where The Day is jewelled in electric lights across the dark sky, you would have seen a little, stout man run down the steps of the entrance at the side, three at...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1879","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM"}}
