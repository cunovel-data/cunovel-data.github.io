{"id":67154,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"THE SURFACE WEST OF TONGA For a long time the horizon had been a monotonous flat blue line separating the Pacific Ocean from the sky. The Navy helicopter raced forward, flying low, near the waves. Despite the noise and the thumping vibration of the blades, Norman Johnson fell asleep. He was tired; he had been traveling on various military aircraft for more than fourteen hours. It was not the kind of thing a fifty-three-year-old professor of psychology was used to. He had no idea how long he slept. When he awoke, he saw that the horizon was still flat; there were white semicircles of coral atolls ahead. He said over the intercom, \"What\u0027s this?\" \"Islands of Ninihina and Tafahi,\" the pilot said. \"Technically part of Tonga, but they\u0027re uninhabited. Good sleep?\" \"Not bad.\" Norman looked at the islands as they flashed by: a curve of white sand, a few palm trees, then gone. The flat ocean again. \"Where\u0027d they bring you in from?\" the pilot asked. \"San Diego,\" Norman said. \"I left yesterday.\" \"So you came Honolulu-Guam-Pago-here?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Long trip,\" the pilot said. \"What kind of work you do, sir?\" \"I\u0027m a psychologist,\" Norman said. \"A shrink, huh?\" The pilot grinned. \"Why not? They\u0027ve called in just about everything else.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"We\u0027ve been ferrying people out of Guam for the last two days. Physicists, biologists, mathematicians, you name it. Everybody being flown to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean.\" \"What\u0027s going on?\" Norman said. The pilot glanced at him, eyes unreadable behind dark aviator sunglasses. \"They\u0027re not telling us anything, sir. What about you? What\u0027d they tell you?\" \"They told me,\" Norman said, \"that there was an airplane crash.\" \"Uh-huh,\" the pilot said. \"You get called on crashes?\" \"I have been, yes.\" For a decade, Norman Johnson had been on the list of FAA crash-site teams, experts called on short notice to investigate civilian air disasters. The first time had been at the United Airlines crash in San Diego in 1976; then he had been called to Chicago in \u002778, and Dallas in \u002782. Each time the pattern was the same - the hurried telephone call, frantic packing, the absence for a week or more. This time his wife, Ellen, had been annoyed because he was called away on July 1, which meant he would miss their July 4 beach barbecue. Then, too, Tim was coming back from his sophomore year at Chicago, on his way to a summer job in the Cascades. And Amy, now sixteen, was just back from Andover, and Amy and Ellen didn\u0027t get along very well if Norman wasn\u0027t there to mediate. The Volvo was making noises again. And it was possible Norman might miss his mother\u0027s birthday the following week. \"What crash is it?\" Ellen had said. \"I haven\u0027t heard about any crash.\" She turned on the radio while he packed. There was no news on the radio of an airline crash. When the car pulled up in front of his house, Norman had been surprised to see it was a Navy pool sedan, with a uniformed Navy driver. \"They never sent a Navy car the other times,\" Ellen said, following him down the stairs to the front door. \"Is this a military crash?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"When will you be back?\" He kissed her. \"I\u0027ll call you,\" he said. \"Promise.\" But he hadn\u0027t called. Everyone had been polite and pleasant, but they had kept him away from telephones. First at Hickam Field in Honolulu, then at the Naval Air Station in Guam, where he had arrived at two in the morning, and had spent half an hour in a room that smelled of aviation gasoline, staring dumbly at an issue of the American Journal of Psychology which he had brought with him, before flying on. He arrived at Pago Pago just as dawn was breaking. Norman was hurried onto the big Sea Knight helicopter, which immediately lifted off the cold tarmac and headed west, over palm trees and rusty corrugated rooftops, into the Pacific. He had been on this helicopter for two hours, sleeping part of the time. Ellen, and Tim and Amy and his mother\u0027s birthday, now seemed very far away. \"Where exactly are we?\" \"Between Samoa and Fiji in the South Pacific,\" the pilot said. \"Can you show me on the chart?\" \"I\u0027m not supposed to do that, sir. Anyway, it wouldn\u0027t show much. Right now you\u0027re two hundred miles from anywhere, sir.\" Norman stared at the flat horizon, still blue and featureless. I can believe it, he thought. He yawned. \"Don\u0027t you get bored looking at that?\" \"To tell you the truth, no, sir,\" the pilot said. \"I\u0027m real happy to see it flat like this. At least we\u0027ve got good weather. And it won\u0027t hold. There\u0027s a cyclone forming up in the Admiralties, should swing down this way in a few days.\" \"What happens then?\" \"Everybody clears the hell out. Weather can be tough in this part of the world, sir. I\u0027m from Florida and I saw some hurricanes when I was a kid, but you\u0027ve never seen anything like a Pacific cyclone, sir.\" Norman nodded. \"How much longer until we get there?\" \"Any minute now, sir.\" After two hours of monotony, the cluster of ships appeared unusually interesting. There were more than a dozen vessels of various kinds, formed roughly into concentric circles. On the outer perimeter, he counted eight gray Navy destroyers. Closer to the center were large ships that had wide-spaced double hulls and looked like floating dry-docks; then nondescript boxy ships with flat helicopter decks; and in the center, amid all the gray, two white ships, each with a flat pad and a bull\u0027s-eye. The pilot listed them off: \"You got your destroyers on the outside, for protection; RVS\u0027s further in, that\u0027s Remote Vehicle Support, for the robots; then MSS, Mission Support and Supply; and OSRV\u0027s in the center.\" \"OSRV\u0027s?\" \"Oceanographic Survey and Research Vessels.\" The pilot pointed to the white ships. \"John Hawes to port, and William Arthur to starboard. We\u0027ll put down on the Hawes.\" The pilot circled the formation of ships. Norman could see launches running back and forth between the ships, leaving small white wakes against the deep blue of the water. \"All this for an airplane crash?\" Norman said. \"Hey,\" the pilot grinned. \"I never mentioned a crash. Check your seat belt if you would, sir. We\u0027re about to land.\" BARNES The red bull\u0027s-eye grew larger, and slid beneath them as the helicopter touched down. Norman fumbled with his seat belt buckle as a uniformed Navy man ran up and opened the door. \"Dr. Johnson? Norman Johnson?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Have any baggage, sir?\" \"Just this.\" Norman reached back, pulled out his day case. The officer took it. \"Any scientific instruments, anything like that?\" \"No. That\u0027s it.\" \"This way, sir. Keep your head down, follow me, and don\u0027t go aft, sir.\" Norman stepped out, ducking beneath the blades. He followed the officer off the helipad and down a narrow stairs. The metal handrail was hot to the touch. Behind him, the helicopter lifted off, the pilot giving him a final wave. Once the helicopter had gone, the Pacific air felt still and brutally hot. \"Good trip, sir?\" \"Fine.\" \"Need to go, sir?\" \"I\u0027ve just arrived,\" Norman said. \"No, I mean: do you need to use the head, sir.\" \"No,\" Norman said. \"Good. Don\u0027t use the heads, they\u0027re all backed up.\" \"All right.\" \"Plumbing\u0027s been screwed up since last night. We\u0027re working on the problem and hope to have it solved soon.\" He peered at Norman. \"We have a lot of women on board at the moment, sir.\" \"I see,\" Norman said. \"There\u0027s a chemical john if you need it, sir.\" \"I\u0027m okay, thanks.\" \"In that case, Captain Barnes wants to see you at once, sir.\" \"I\u0027d like to call my family.\" \"You can mention that to Captain Barnes, sir.\" They ducked through a door, moving out of the hot sun into a fluorescent-lit hallway. It was much cooler. \"Air conditioning hasn\u0027t gone out lately,\" the officer said. \"At least that\u0027s something.\" \"Does the air conditioning go out often?\" \"Only when it\u0027s hot.\" Through another door, and into a large workroom: metal walls, racks of tools, acetylene torches spraying sparks as workmen hunched over metal pontoons and pieces of intricate machinery, cables snaking over the floor. \"We do ROV repairs here,\" the officer said, shouting over the din. \"Most of the heavy work is done on the tenders. We just do some of the electronics here. We go this way, sir.\" Through another door, down another corridor, and into a wide, low-ceilinged room crammed with video monitors. A half-dozen technicians sat in shadowy half-darkness before the color screens. Norman paused to look. \"This is where we monitor the ROV\u0027s,\" the officer said. \"We\u0027ve got three or four robots down on the bottom at any given time. Plus the MSB\u0027s and the FD\u0027s, of course.\" Norman heard the crackle and hiss of radio communications, soft fragments of words he couldn\u0027t make out. On one screen he saw a diver walking on the bottom. The diver was standing in harsh artificial light, wearing a kind of suit Norman had never seen, heavy blue cloth and a brightyellow helmet sculpted in an odd shape. Norman pointed to the screen. \"How deep is he?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Thousand, twelve hundred feet, something like that.\" \"And what have they found?\" \"So far, just the big titanium fin.\" The officer glanced around. \"It doesn\u0027t read on any monitors now. Bill, can you show Dr. Johnson here the fin?\" \"Sorry, sir,\" the technician said. \"Present MainComOps is working north of there, in quadrant seven.\" \"Ah. Quad seven\u0027s almost half a mile away from the fin,\" the officer said to Norman. \"Too bad: it\u0027s a hell of a thing to see. But you\u0027ll see it later, I\u0027m sure. This way to Captain Barnes.\" They walked for a moment down the corridor; then the officer said, \"Do you know the Captain, sir?\" \"No, why?\" \"Just wondered. He\u0027s been very eager to see you. Calling up the com techs every hour, to find out when you\u0027re arriving.\" \"No,\" Norman said, \"I\u0027ve never met him.\" \"Very nice man.\" \"I\u0027 m sure.\" The officer glanced over his shoulder. \"You know, they have a saying about the Captain,\" he said. \"Oh? What\u0027s that?\" \"They say his bite is worse than his bark.\" Through another door, which was marked \"Project Commander\" and had beneath that a sliding plate that said \"Capt. Harold C. Barnes, USN.\" The officer stepped aside, and Norman entered a paneled stateroom. A burly man in shirtsleeves stood up from behind a stack of files. Captain Barnes was one of those trim military men who made Norman feel fat and inadequate. In his middle forties, Hal Barnes had erect military bearing, an alert expression, short hair, a flat gut, and a politician\u0027s firm handshake. \"Welcome aboard the Hawes, Dr. Johnson. How\u0027re you feeling?\" \"Tired,\" Norman said. \"I\u0027m sure, I\u0027m sure. You came from San Diego?\" \"Yes.\" \"So it\u0027s fifteen hours, give or take. Like to have a rest?\" \"I\u0027d like to know what\u0027s going on,\" Norman said. \"Perfectly understandable.\" Barnes nodded. \"What\u0027d they tell you?\" \"Who?\" \"The men who picked you up in San Diego, the men who flew you out here, the men in Guam. Whatever.\" \"They didn\u0027t tell me anything.\" \"And did you see any reporters, any press?\" \"No, nothing like that.\" Barnes smiled. \"Good. I\u0027m glad to hear it.\" He waved Norman to a seat. Norman sat gratefully. \"How about some coffee?\" Barnes said, moving to a coffee maker behind his desk, and then the lights went out. The room was dark except for the light that streamed in from a side porthole. \"God damn it!\" Barnes said. \"Not again. Emerson! Emerson!\" An ensign came in a side door. \"Sir! Working on it, Captain.\" \"What was it this time?\" \"Blew out in ROV Bay 2, sir.\" \"I thought we added extra lines to Bay 2.\" \"Apparently they overloaded anyway, sir.\" \"I want this fixed now, Emerson!\" \"We hope to have it solved soon, sir.\" The door closed; Barnes sat back in his chair. Norman heard the voice in the darkness. \"It\u0027s not really their fault,\" he said. \"These ships weren\u0027t built for the kind of power loads we put on them now, and - ah, there we are.\" The lights came back on. Barnes smiled. \"Did you say you wanted coffee, Dr. Johnson?\" \"Black is fine,\" Norman said. Barnes poured him a mug. \"Anyway, I\u0027m relieved you didn\u0027t talk to anybody. In my job, Dr. Johnson, security is the biggest worry. Especially on a thing like this. If word gets out about this site, we\u0027ll have all kinds of problems. And so many people are involved now. ... Hell, CincComPac didn\u0027t even want to give me destroyers until I started talking about Soviet submarine reconnaissance. The next thing, I get four, then eight destroyers.\" \"Soviet submarine reconnaissance?\" Norman asked. \"That\u0027s what I told them in Honolulu.\" Barnes grinned. \"Part of the game, to get what you need for an operation like this. You\u0027ve got to know how to requisition equipment in the modern Navy. But of course the Soviets won\u0027t come around.\" \"They won\u0027t?\" Norman felt he had somehow missed the assumptions that lay behind the conversation, and was trying to catch up. \"It\u0027s very unlikely. Oh, they know we\u0027re here. They\u0027ll have spotted us with their satellites at least two days ago, but we\u0027re putting out a steady stream of decodable messages about our Search and Rescue exercises in the South Pacific. S and R drill represents a low priority for them, even though they undoubtedly figure a plane went down and we\u0027re recovering for real. They may even suspect that we\u0027re trying to recover nuclear warheads, like we did off of Spain in \u002768. But they\u0027ll leave us alone - because politically they don\u0027t want to be implicated in our nuclear problems. They know we have troubles with New Zealand these days.\" \"Is that what all this is?\" Norman said. \"Nuclear warheads?\" \"No,\" Barnes said. \"Thank God. Anything nuclear, somebody in the White House always feels duty-bound to announce it. But we\u0027ve kept this one away from the White House staff. In fact, we bypass the JCS on this. All briefings go straight from the Defense Secretary to the President, personally.\" He rapped his knuckles on the desk. \"So far, so good. And you\u0027re the last to arrive. Now that you\u0027re here, we\u0027ll shut this thing down tight. Nothing in, nothing out.\" Norman still couldn\u0027t put it together. \"If nuclear warheads aren\u0027t involved in the crash,\" he said, \"why the secrecy?\" \"Well,\" Barnes said. \"We don\u0027t have all the facts yet.\" \"The crash occurred in the ocean?\" \"Yes. More or less directly beneath us as we sit here.\" \"Then there can\u0027t be any survivors.\" \"Survivors?\" Barnes looked surprised. \"No, I wouldn\u0027t think so.\" \"Then why was I called here?\" Barnes looked blank. \"Well,\" Norman explained, \"I\u0027m usually called to crash sites when there are survivors. That\u0027s why they put a psychologist on the team, to deal with the acute traumatic problems of surviving passengers, or sometimes the relatives of surviving passengers. Their feelings, and their fears, and their recurring nightmares. People who survive a crash often experience all sorts of guilt and anxiety, concerning why they survived and not others. A woman sitting with her husband and children, suddenly they\u0027re all dead and she alone is alive. That kind of thing.\" Norman sat back in his chair. \"But in this case - an airplane that crashed in a thousand feet of water - there wouldn\u0027t be any of those problems. So why am I here?\" Barnes was staring at him. He seemed uncomfortable. He shuffled the files around on his desk. \"Actually, this isn\u0027t an airplane crash site, Dr. Johnson.\" \"What is it?\" \"It\u0027s a spacecraft crash site.\" There was a short pause. Norman nodded. \"I see.\" \"That doesn\u0027t surprise you?\" Barnes said. \"No,\" Norman said. \"As a matter of fact, it explains a lot. If a military spacecraft crashed in the ocean, that explains why I haven\u0027t heard anything about it on the radio, why it was kept secret, why I was brought here the way I was. ... When did it crash?\" Barnes hesitated just a fraction before answering. \"As best we can estimate,\" he said, \"this spacecraft crashed three hundred years ago.\" ULF There was a silence. Norman listened to the drone of the air conditioner. He heard faintly the radio communications in the next room. He looked at the mug of coffee in his hand, noticing a chip on the rim. He struggled to assimilate what he was being told, but his mind moved sluggishly, in circles. Three hundred years ago, he thought. A spacecraft three hundred years old. But the space program wasn\u0027t three hundred years old. It was barely thirty years old. So how could a spacecraft be three hundred years old? It couldn\u0027t be. Barnes must be mistaken. But how could Barnes be mistaken? The Navy wouldn\u0027t send all these ships, all these people, unless they were sure what was down there. A spacecraft three hundred years old. But how could that be? It couldn\u0027t be. It must be something else. He went over it again and again, getting nowhere, his mind dazed and shocked. \" - solutely no question about it,\" Barnes was saying. \"We can estimate the date from coral growth with great accuracy. Pacific coral grows two-and-a-half centimeters a year, and the object - whatever it is - is covered in about five meters of coral. That\u0027s a lot of coral. Of course, coral doesn\u0027t grow at a depth of a thousand feet, which means that the present shelf collapsed to a lower depth at some point in the past. The geologists are telling us that happened about a century ago, so we\u0027re assuming a total age for the craft of about three hundred years. But we could be wrong about that. It could, in fact, be much older. It could be a thousand years old.\" Barnes shifted papers on his desk again, arranging them into neat stacks, lining up the edges. \"I don\u0027t mind telling you, Dr. Johnson, this thing scares the hell out of me. That\u0027s why you\u0027re here.\" Norman shook his head. \"I still don\u0027t understand.\" \"We brought you here,\" Barnes said, \"because of your association with the ULF project.\" \"ULF?\" Norman said. And he almost added, But ULF was a joke. Seeing how serious Barnes was, he was glad he had caught himself in time. Yet ulf was a joke. Everything about it had been a joke, from the very beginning. In 1979, in the waning days of the Carter Administration, Norman Johnson had been an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California at San Diego; his particular research interest was group dynamics and anxiety, and he occasionally served on FAA crash-site teams. In those days, his biggest problems had been finding a house for Ellen and the kids, keeping up his publications, and wondering whether UCSD would give him tenure. Norman\u0027s research was considered brilliant, but psychology was notoriously prone to intellectual fashions, and interest in the study of anxiety was declining as many researchers came to regard anxiety as a purely biochemical disorder that could be treated with drug therapy alone; one scientist had even gone so far as to say, \"Anxiety is no longer a problem in psychology. There is nothing left to study.\" Similarly, group dynamics was perceived as old-fashioned, a field that had seen its heyday in the Gestalt encounter groups and corporate brainstorming procedures of the early 1970s but now was dated and passe. Norman himself could not comprehend this. It seemed to him that American society was increasingly one in which people worked in groups, not alone; rugged individualism was now replaced by endless corporate meetings and group decisions. In this new society, group behavior seemed to him more important, not less. And he did not think that anxiety as a clinical problem was going to be solved with pills. It seemed to him that a society in which the most common prescription drug was Valium was, by definition, a society with unsolved problems. Not until the preoccupation with Japanese managerial techniques in the 1980s did Norman\u0027s field gain a new hold on academic attention. Around the same time, Valium dependence became recognized as a major concern, and the whole issue of drug therapy for anxiety was reconsidered. But in the meantime, Johnson spent several years feeling as if he were in a backwater. (He did not have a research grant approved for nearly three years.) Tenure, and finding a house, were very real problems. It was during the worst of this time, in late 1979, that he was approached by a solemn young lawyer from the National Security Council in Washington who sat with his ankle across his knee and plucked nervously at his sock. The lawyer told Norman that he had come to ask his help. Norman said he would help if he could. Still plucking at the sock, the lawyer said he wanted to talk to Norman about a \"grave matter of national security facing our country today.\" Norman asked what the problem was. \"Simply that this country has absolutely no preparedness in the event of an alien invasion. Absolutely no preparedness whatever.\" Because the lawyer was young, and because he stared down at his sock as he spoke, Norman at first thought he was embarrassed at having been sent on a fool\u0027s errand. But when the young man looked up, Norman saw to his astonishment that he was utterly serious. \"We could really be caught with our pants down on this one,\" the lawyer said. \"An alien invasion.\" Norman had to bite his lip. \"That\u0027s probably true,\" he said. \"People in the Administration are worried.\" \"Are they?\" \"There is the feeling at the highest levels that contingency plans should be drawn.\" \"You mean contingency plans in the event of an alien invasion. ...\" Norman somehow managed to keep a straight face. \"Perhaps,\" said the lawyer, \"perhaps invasion is too strong a word. Let\u0027s soften that to say \u0027contact\u0027: alien contact.\" \"I see.\" \"You\u0027re already involved in civilian crash-site teams, Dr. Johnson. You know how these emergency groups function. We want your input concerning the optimal composition of a crash-site team to confront an alien invader.\" \"I see,\" Norman said, wondering how he could tactfully get out of this. The idea was clearly ludicrous. He could see it only as displacement: the Administration, faced with immense problems it could not solve, had decided to think about something else. And then the lawyer coughed, proposed a study, and named a substantial figure for a two-year research grant. Norman saw a chance to buy his house. He said yes. \"I\u0027m glad you agree the problem is a real one.\" \"Oh yes,\" Norman said, wondering how old this lawyer was. He guessed about twenty-five. \"We\u0027ll just have to get your security clearance,\" the lawyer said. \"I need security clearance?\" \"Dr. Johnson,\" the lawyer said, snapping his briefcase shut, \"this project is top, top secret.\" \"That\u0027s fine with me,\" Norman said, and he meant it. He could imagine his colleagues\u0027 reactions if they ever found out about this. What began as a joke soon became simply bizarre. Over the next year, Norman flew five times to Washington for meetings with high-level officials of the National Security Council over the pressing, imminent danger of alien invasion. His work was very secret. One early question was whether his project should be turned over to DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency of the Pentagon. They decided not to. There were questions about whether it should be given to NASA, and again they decided not to. One Administration official said, \"This isn\u0027t a scientific matter, Dr. Johnson, this is a national security matter. We don\u0027t want to open it out.\" Norman was continually surprised at the level of the officials he was told to meet with. One Senior Undersecretary of State pushed aside the papers on his desk relating to the latest Middle East crisis to say, \"What do you think about the possibility that these aliens will be able to read our minds?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Norman said. \"Well, it occurs to me. How\u0027re we going to be able to formulate a negotiating posture if they can read our minds?\" \"That could be a problem,\" Norman agreed, sneaking a glance at his watch. \"Hell, it\u0027s bad enough our encrypted cables get intercepted by the Russians. We know the Japanese and the Israelis have cracked all our codes. We just pray the Russians can\u0027t do it yet. But you see what I mean, the problem. About reading minds.\" \"Oh yes.\" \"Your report will have to take that into consideration.\" Norman promised it would. A White House staffer said to him, \"You realize the President will want to talk to these aliens personally. He\u0027s that kind of man.\" \"Uh-huh,\" Norman said. \"And I mean, the publicity value here, the exposure, is incalculable. The President meets with the aliens at Camp David. What a media moment.\" \"A real moment,\" Norman agreed. \"So the aliens will need to be informed by an advance man of who the President is, and the protocol in talking to him. You can\u0027t have the President of the United States talking to people from another galaxy or whatever on television without advance preparation. Do you think the aliens\u0027ll speak English?\" \"Doubtful,\" Norman said. \"So someone may need to learn their language, is that it?\" \"It\u0027s hard to say.\" \"Perhaps the aliens would be more comfortable meeting with an advance man from one of our ethnic minorities,\" the White House man said. \"Anyway, it\u0027s a possibility. Think about it.\" Norman promised he would think about it. The Pentagon liaison, a Major General, took him to lunch and over coffee casually asked, \"What sorts of armaments do you see these aliens having?\" \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Norman said. \"Well, that\u0027s the crux of it, isn\u0027t it? And what about their vulnerabilities? I mean, the aliens might not even be human at all.\" \"No, they might not.\" \"They might be like giant insects. Your insects can withstand a lot of radiation.\" \"Yes,\" Norman said. \"We might not be able to touch these aliens,\" the Pentagon man said gloomily. Then he brightened. \"But I doubt they could withstand a direct hit with a multimeg nuclear device, do you?\" \"No,\" Norman said. \"I don\u0027t think they could.\" \"It\u0027d vaporize \u0027em.\" \"Sure.\" \"Laws of physics.\" \"Right.\" \"Your report must make that point clearly. About the nuclear vulnerability of these aliens.\" \"Yes,\" Norman said. \"We don\u0027t want to start a panic,\" the Pentagon man said. \"No sense getting everyone upset, is there? I know the JCS will be reassured to hear the aliens are vulnerable to our nuclear weapons.\" \"I\u0027ll keep that in mind,\" Norman said. Eventually, the meetings ended, and he was left to write his report. And as he reviewed the published speculations on extraterrestrial life, he decided that the Major General from the Pentagon was not so wrong, after all. The real question about alien contact - if there was any real question at all - concerned panic. Psychological panic. The only important human experience with extraterrestrials had been Orson Welles\u0027s 1938 radio broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds.\" And the human response was unequivocal. People had been terrified. Norman submitted his report, entitled \"Contact with Possible Extraterrestrial Life.\" It was returned to him by the NSC with the suggestion that the title be revised to \"sound more technical\" and that he remove \"any suggestion that alien contact was only a possibility, as alien contact is considered virtually certain in some quarters of the Administration.\" Revised, Norman\u0027s paper was duly classified Top Secret, under the title \"Recommendations for the Human Contact Team to Interact with Unknown Life Forms (ULF).\" As Norman envisioned it, the ULF Contact Team demanded particularly stable individuals. In his report he had said \"I wonder,\" Barnes said, opening a folder, \"if you recognize this quote: Contact teams meeting an Unknown Life Form (ULF) must be prepared for severe psychological impact. Extreme anxiety responses will almost certainly occur. The personality traits of individuals who can withstand extreme anxiety must be determined, and such individuals selected to comprise the team. Anxiety when confronted by unknown life has not been sufficiently appreciated. The fears unleashed by contact with a new life form are not understood and cannot be entirely predicted in advance. But the most likely consequence of contact is absolute terror.\" Barnes snapped the folder shut. \"You remember who said that?\" \"Yes,\" Norman said. \"I do.\" And he remembered why he had said it. As part of the NSC grant, Norman had conducted studies of group dynamics in contexts of psychosocial anxiety. Following the procedures of Asch and Milgram, he constructed several environments in which subjects did not know they were being tested. In one case, a group of subjects were told to take an elevator to another floor to participate in a test. The elevator jammed between floors. Subjects were then observed by hidden video camera. There were several variations to this. Sometimes the elevator was marked \"Under Repair\"; sometimes there was telephone communication with the \"repairman,\" sometimes not; sometimes the ceiling fell in, and the lights went out; and sometimes the floor of the elevator was constructed of clear lucite. In another case, subjects were loaded into a van and driven out into the desert by an \"experiment leader\" who ran out of gas, and then suffered a \"heart attack,\" thus stranding the subjects. In the most severe version, subjects were taken up in a private plane, and the pilot suffered a \"heart attack\" in mid-air. Despite the traditional complaints about such tests - that they were sadistic, that they were artificial, that subjects somehow sensed the situations were contrived - Johnson gained considerable information about groups under anxiety stress. He found that fear responses were minimized when the group was small (five or less); when group members knew each other well; when group members could see each other and were not isolated; when they shared defined group goals and fixed time limits; when groups were mixed age and mixed gender; and when group members had high phobic-tolerant personalities as measured by LAS tests for anxiety, which in turn correlated with athletic fitness. Study results were formulated in dense statistical tables, although, in essence, Norman knew he had merely verified common sense: if you were trapped in an elevator, it was better to be with a few relaxed, athletic people you knew, to keep the lights on, and to know someone was working to get you free. Yet Norman knew that some of his results were counterintuitive, such as the importance of group composition. Groups composed entirely of men or entirely of women were much poorer at handling stress than mixed groups; groups composed of individuals roughly the same age were much poorer than groups of mixed age. And pre-existing groups formed for another purpose did worst of all; at one point he had stressed a championship basketball team, and it cracked almost immediately. Although his research was good, Norman remained uneasy about the underlying purposes for his paper - alien invasion - which he personally considered speculative to the point of absurdity. He was embarrassed to submit his paper, particularly after he had rewritten it to make it seem more significant than he knew it was. He was relieved when the Carter Administration did not like his report. None of Norman\u0027s recommendations were approved. The Administration did not agree with Dr. Norman Johnson that fear was a problem; they thought the predominant human emotion would be wonder and awe. Furthermore, the Administration preferred a large contact team of thirty people, including three theologians, a lawyer, a physician, a representative from the State Department, a representative from the Joint Chiefs, a select group from the legislative branch, an aerospace engineer, an exobiologist, a nuclear physicist, a cultural anthropologist, and a television anchor personality. In any case, President Carter was not re-elected in 1980, and Norman heard nothing further about his ULF proposal. He had heard nothing for six years. Until now. Barnes said, \"You remember the ULF team you proposed?\" \"Of course,\" Norman said. Norman had recommended a ULF team of four - an astrophysicist, a zoologist, a mathematician, a linguist - and a fifth member, a psychologist, whose job would be to monitor the behavior and attitude of the working team members. \"Give me your opinion of this,\" Barnes said. He handed Norman a sheet of paper: ANOMALY INVESTIGATION TEAM USN STAFF/SUPPORT MEMBERS 1. Harold C. Barnes, USN Project Commander Captain 2. Jane Edmunds, USN Data Processing Tech P.O. 1C 3.

I even interviewed them, and tested them, back then.\" \"Correct.\" \"But you said yourself: there are probably no survivors.
