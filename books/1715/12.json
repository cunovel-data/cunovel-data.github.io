He found Beth in her laboratory, on the top level of D Cyl. He walked in just in time to see her take a pill. \"What was that?\" \"Valium. God.\" \"Where\u0027d you get it?\" \"Look,\" she said, \"don\u0027t give me any psychotalk about it - \" \" - I was just asking.\" Beth pointed to a white box mounted on the wall in the corner of the lab. \"There\u0027s a first-aid kit in every cylinder. Turns out to be pretty complete, too.\" Norman went over to the box, flipped open the lid. There were neat compartments with medicines, syringes, bandages. Beth was right, it was quite complete - antibiotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, even surgical anesthetics. He didn\u0027t recognize all the names on the bottles, but the psychoactive drugs were strong. \"You could fight a war with the stuff in this kit.\" \"Yeah, well. The Navy.\" \"There\u0027s everything you need here to do major surgery.\" Norman noticed a card on the inside of the box. It said \"MEDAID CODE 103.\" \"Any idea what this means?\" She nodded. \"It\u0027s a computer code. I called it up.\" \"And?\" \"The news,\" she said, \"is not good.\" \"Is that right?\" He sat at the terminal in her room and punched in 103. The screen said: HYPERBARIC SATURATED ENVIRONMENT MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS (MAJOR-FATAL) 1.01 Pulmonary Embolism 1.02 High Pressure Nervous Syndrome 1.03 Aseptic Bone Necrosis 1.04 Oxygen Toxicity 1.05 Thermal Stress Syndrome 1.06 Disseminated Pseudomonas Infection 1.07 Cerebral Infarction Choose One: \"Don\u0027t choose one,\" Beth said. \"Reading the details will only upset you. Just leave it at this - we\u0027re in a very dangerous environment. Barnes didn\u0027t bother to give us all the gory details. You know why the Navy has that rule about pulling people out within seventy-two hours? Because after seventy-two hours, you increase your risk of something called \u0027aseptic bone necrosis.\u0027 Nobody knows why, but the pressurized environment causes bone destruction in the leg and hip. And you know why this habitat constantly adjusts as we walk through it? It\u0027s not because that\u0027s slick and hightech. It\u0027s because the helium atmosphere makes body-heat control very volatile. You can quickly become overheated, and just as quickly overchilled. Fatally so. It can happen so fast you don\u0027t realize it until it\u0027s too late and you drop dead. And \u0027high pressure nervous syndrome\u0027 - that turns out to be sudden convulsions, paralysis, and death if the carbondioxide content of the atmosphere drops too low. That\u0027s what the badges are for, to make sure we have enough CO2 in the air. That\u0027s the only reason we have the badges. Nice, huh?\" Norman flicked off the screen, sat back. \"Well, I keep coming back to the same point - there\u0027s not much we can do about it now.\" \"Exactly what Barnes said.\" Beth started pushing equipment around on her counter top, nervously. Rearranging things. \"Too bad we don\u0027t have a sample of those jellyfish,\" Norman said. \"Yes, but I\u0027m not sure how much good it would do, to tell the truth.\" She frowned, shifted papers on the counter again. \"Norman, I\u0027m not thinking very clearly down here.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"After the, uh, accident, I came up here to look over my notes, review things. And I checked the shrimps. Remember how I told you they didn\u0027t have any stomach? Well, they do. I\u0027d made a bad dissection, out of the midsagittal plane. I just missed all the midline structures. But they\u0027re there, all right; the shrimps are normal. And the squid? It turns out the one squid I dissected was a little anomalous. It had an atrophic gill, but it had one. And the other squid are perfectly normal. Just what you\u0027d expect. I was wrong, too hasty. It really bothers me.\" \"Is that why you took the Valium?\" She nodded. \"I hate to be sloppy.\" \"Nobody\u0027s criticizing you.\" \"If Harry or Ted reviewed my work and found that I\u0027d made these stupid mistakes ...\" \"What\u0027s wrong with a mistake?\" \"I can hear them now: Just like a woman, not careful enough, too eager to make a discovery, trying to prove herself, too quick to draw conclusions. Just like a woman.\" \"Nobody\u0027s criticizing you, Beth.\" \"I am.\" \"Nobody else,\" Norman said. \"I think you ought to give yourself a break.\" She stared at the lab bench. Finally she said, \"I can\u0027t.\" Something about the way she said it touched him. \"I understand,\" Norman said, and a memory came rushing back to him. \"You know, when I was a kid, I went to the beach with my younger brother. Tim. He\u0027s dead now, but Tim was about six at the time. He couldn\u0027t swim yet. My mother told me to watch him carefully, but when I got to the beach all my friends were there, body-surfing. I didn\u0027t want to be bothered with my brother. It was hard, because I wanted to be out in the big surf, and he had to stay close to shore. \"Anyway, in the middle of the afternoon he comes out of the water screaming bloody murder, absolutely screaming. And tugging at his right side. It turned out he had been stung by some kind of a jellyfish. It was still attached to him, sticking to his side. Then he collapsed on the beach. One of the mothers ran over and took Timmy to the hospital, before I could even get out of the water. I didn\u0027t know where he had gone. I got to the hospital later. My mother was already there. Tim was in shock; I guess the poison was a heavy dose for his small body. Anyway, nobody blamed me. It wouldn\u0027t have mattered if I had been sitting right on the beach watching him like a hawk, he would still have been stung. But I hadn\u0027t been sitting there, and I blamed myself for years, long after he was fine. Every time I\u0027d see those scars on his side, I felt terrible guilt. But you get over it. You\u0027re not responsible for everything that happens in the world. You just aren\u0027t.\" There was a silence. Somewhere in the habitat he heard a soft rhythmic knocking, a sort of thumping. And the everpresent hum of the air handlers. Beth was staring at him. \"Seeing Edmunds die must have been hard for you.\" \"It\u0027s funny,\" Norman said. \"I never made the connection, until right now.\" \"Blocked it, I guess. Want a Valium?\" He smiled. \"No.\" \"You looked as if you were about to cry.\" \"No. I\u0027m fine.\" He stood up, stretched. He went over to the medicine kit and closed the white lid, came back. Beth said, \"What do you think about these messages we\u0027re getting?\" \"Beats me,\" Norman said. He sat down again. \"Actually, I did have one crazy thought. Do you suppose the messages and these animals we\u0027re seeing are related?\" \"Why?\" \"I never thought about it until we started to get spiral messages. Harry says it\u0027s because the thing - the famous it - believes we think in spirals. But it\u0027s just as likely that it thinks in spirals and so it assumes we do, too. The sphere is round, isn\u0027t it? And we\u0027ve been seeing all these radially symmetrical animals. Jellyfish, squid.\" \"Nice idea,\" Beth said, \"except for the fact that squid aren\u0027t radially symmetrical. An octopus is. And, like an octopus, squid have a round circle of tentacles, but squid\u0027re bilaterally symmetrical, with a matching left and right side, the way we have. And then there\u0027s the shrimps.\" \"That\u0027s right, the shrimps.\" Norman had forgotten about the shrimps. \"I can\u0027t see a connection between the sphere and the animals,\" Beth said. They heard the thumping again, soft, rhythmic. Sitting in his chair, Norman realized that he could feel the thumping as well, as a slight impact. \"What is that, anyway?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Sounds like it\u0027s coming from outside.\" He had started toward the porthole when the intercom clicked and he heard Barnes say, \"Now hear this, all hands to communications. All hands to communications. Dr. Adams has broken the code.\" Harry wouldn\u0027t tell them the message right away. Relishing his triumph, he insisted on going through the decoding process, step by step. First, he explained, he had thought that the messages might express some universal constant, or some physical law, stated as a way to open conversation. \"But,\" Harry said, \"it might also be a graphic representation of some kind - code for a picture - which presented immense problems. After all, what\u0027s a picture? We make pictures on a flat plane, like a piece of paper. We determine positions within a picture by what we call X and Y axes. Vertical and horizontal. But another intelligence might see images and organize them very differently. It might assume more than three dimensions. Or it might work from the center of the picture outward, for example. So the code might be very tough. I didn\u0027t make much progress at first.\" Later, when he got the same message with gaps between number sequences, Harry began to suspect that the code represented discrete chunks of information - suggesting words, not pictures. \"Now, word codes fall into several types, from simple to complex. There was no way to know immediately which method of encoding had been used. But then I had a sudden insight.\" They waited, impatiently, for his insight. \"Why use a code at all?\" Harry asked. \"Why use a code?\" Norman said. \"Sure. If you are trying to communicate with someone, you don\u0027t use a code. Codes are ways of hiding communication. So perhaps this intelligence thinks he is communicating directly, but is actually making some kind of logical mistake in talking to us. He is making a code without ever intending to do so. That suggested the unintentional code was probably a substitution code, with numbers for letters. When I got the word breaks, I began to try and match numbers to letters by frequency analysis. In frequency analysis you break down codes by using the fact that the most common letter in English is \u0027e,\u0027 and the second most common letter is \u0027t,\u0027 and so on. So I looked for the most common numbers. But I was impeded by the fact that even a short number sequence, such as two-three-two, might represent many code possibilities: two and three and two, twenty-three and two, two and thirtytwo, or two hundred and thirty-two. Longer code sequences had many more possibilities.\" Then, he said, he was sitting in front of the computer thinking about the spiral messages, and he suddenly looked at the keyboard. \"I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard, those rows of symbols on a device made to be pressed. How confusing it must look to another kind of creature! Look here,\" he said. \"The letters on a regular keyboard go like this.\" He held up his pad. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 tab Q W E R T Y U I O P caps A S D F G H J K L ; shift Z X C V B N M , . ? \"And then I imagined what the keyboard would look like as a spiral, since our creature seems to prefer spirals. And I started numbering the keys in concentric circles. \"It took a little experimentation, since the keys don\u0027t line up exactly, but finally I got it,\" he said. \"Look here: the numbers spiral out from the center. G is one, B is two, H is three, Y is four, and so on. See? It\u0027s like this.\" He quickly penciled in numbers. 1 2 3 4 5 612 711 9 9 0 tab Q W E R13 T5 Y4 U10 1 O P caps A S D14 F6 G1 H3 J9 K L , shift Z X C15 V7 B2 N8 M , . ? \"They just keep spiraling outward - M is sixteen, K is seventeen, and so forth. So finally I understood the message.\" \"What is the message, Harry?\" Harry hesitated. \"I have to tell you. It\u0027s strange.\" \"How do you mean, strange?\" Harry tore another sheet off his yellow pad and handed it to them. Norman read the short message, printed in neat block letters: HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? I AM FINE. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? MY NAME IS JERRY. THE FIRST EXCHANGE \"Well,\" Ted said finally. \"this is not what I expected at all.\" \"It looks childish,\" Beth said. \"Like something out of those old \u0027See Spot run\u0027 readers for kids.\" \"That\u0027s exactly what it looks like.\" \"Maybe you translated it wrong,\" Barnes said. \"Certainly not,\" Harry said. \"Well, this alien sounds like an idiot,\" Barnes said. \"I doubt very much that he is,\" Ted said. \"You would doubt it,\" Barnes said. \"A stupid alien would blow your whole theory. But it\u0027s something to consider, isn\u0027t it? A stupid alien. They must have them.\" \"I doubt,\" Ted said, \"that anyone in command of such high technology as that sphere is stupid.\" \"Then you haven\u0027t noticed all the ninnies driving cars back home,\" Barnes said. \"Jesus, after all this effort: \u0027How are you? I am fine.\u0027 Jesus.\" Norman said, \"I don\u0027t feel that this message implies a lack of intelligence, Hal.\" \"On the contrary,\" Harry said. \"I think the message is very smart.\" \"I\u0027m listening,\" Barnes said. \"The content certainly appears childish,\" Harry said. \"But when you think about it, it\u0027s highly logical. A simple message is unambiguous, friendly, and not frightening. It makes a lot of sense to send such a message. I think he\u0027s approaching us in the simple way that we might approach a dog. You know, hold out your hand, let it sniff, get used to you.\" \"You\u0027re saying he\u0027s treating us like dogs?\" Barnes said. Norman thought: Barnes is in over his head. He\u0027s irritable because he\u0027s frightened; he feels inadequate. Or perhaps he feels he\u0027s exceeding his authority. \"No, Hal,\" Ted said. \"He\u0027s just starting at a simple level.\" \"Well, it\u0027s simple, all right,\" Barnes said. \"Jesus Christ, we contact an alien from outer space, and he says his name is Jerry.\" \"Let\u0027s not jump to conclusions, Hal.\" \"Maybe he has a last name,\" Barnes said hopefully. \"I mean, my report to CincComPac is going to say one person died on a deepsat expedition to meet an alien named Jerry? It could sound better. Anything but Jerry,\" Barnes said. \"Can we ask him?\" \"Ask him what?\" Harry said. \"His full name.\" Ted said, \"I personally feel we should have much more substantive conversations - \" \" - I\u0027d like the full name,\" Barnes said. \"For the report.\" \"Right,\" Ted said. \"Full name, rank, and serial number.\" \"I would remind you, Dr. Fielding, that I am in charge here.\" Harry said, \"The first thing we have to do is to see if he\u0027ll talk at all. Let\u0027s give him the first number grouping.\" He typed: 00032125252632 There was a pause, then the answer came back: 00032125252632 \"Okay,\" Harry said. \"Jerry\u0027s listening.\" He made some notes on his pad and typed another string of numbers: 00029213013210613182108142232 \"What did you say?\" Beth said. \" \u0027We are friends,\u0027 \" Harry said. \"Forget friends. Ask his damn name,\" Barnes said. \"Just a minute. One thing at a time.\" Ted said, \"He may not have a last name, you know.\" \"You can be damn sure,\" Barnes said, \"that his real name isn\u0027t Jerry.\" The response came back: 0004212232 \"He said, \u0027Yes.\u0027 \" \"Yes, what?\" Barnes said. \"Just \u0027yes.\u0027 Let\u0027s see if we can get him to switch over to English characters. It\u0027ll be easier if he uses letters and not his number codes.\" \"How\u0027re you going to get him to use letters?\" \"We\u0027ll show him they\u0027re the same,\" Harry said. He typed: 00032125252632 \u003d HELLO. After a short pause, the screen blinked: 00032125252632 \u003d HELLO. \"He doesn\u0027t get it,\" Ted said. \"No, doesn\u0027t look like it. Let\u0027s try another pairing.\" He typed: 0004212232 \u003d YES. The reply came back: 0004212232 \u003d YES. \"He\u0027s definitely not getting it,\" Ted said. \"I thought he was so smart,\" Barnes said. \"Give him a chance,\" Ted said. \"After all, he\u0027s speaking our language, not the other way around.\" \"The other way around,\" Harry said. \"Good idea. Let\u0027s try the other way around, see if he\u0027ll deduce the equation that way.\" Harry typed: 0004212232 \u003d YES. YES. \u003d 0004212232 There was a long pause, while they watched the screen. Nothing happened. \"Is he thinking?\" \"Who knows what he\u0027s doing?\" \"Why isn\u0027t he answering?\" \"Let\u0027s give him a chance, Hal, okay?\" The reply finally came: YES. \u003d 0004212232 2322124000 \u003d SEY \"Uh-uh. He thinks we\u0027re showing him mirror images.\" \"Stupid,\" Barnes said. \"I knew it.\" \"What do we do now?\" \"Let\u0027s try a more complete statement,\" Harry said. \"Give him more to work with.\" Harry typed: 0004212232 \u003d 0004212232, YES. \u003d YES. 0004212232 \u003d YES. \"A syllogism,\" Ted said. \"Very good.\" \"A what?\" Barnes said. \"A logical proposition,\" Ted said. The reply came back: ,\u003d, \"What the hell is that?\" Barnes said. Harry smiled. \"I think he\u0027s playing with us.\" \"Playing with us? You call that playing?\" \"Yes, I do,\" Harry said. \"What you really mean is that he\u0027s testing us - testing our responses to a pressure situation.\" Barnes narrowed his eyes. \"He\u0027s only pretending to be stupid.\" \"Maybe he\u0027s testing how smart we are,\" Ted said. \"Maybe he thinks we\u0027re stupid, Hal.\" \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" Barnes said. \"No,\" Harry said. \"The point is, he\u0027s acting like a kid trying to make friends. And when kids try to make friends, they start playing together. Let\u0027s try something playful.\" Harry sat at the console, typed: \u003d\u003d\u003d The reply quickly came back: ?, \"Cute,\" Harry said. \"This guy is very cute.\" He quickly typed: \u003d,\u003d The reply came: 7 \u0026 7 \"Are you enjoying yourself?\" Barnes said. \"Because I don\u0027t know what the hell you are doing.\" \"He understands me fine,\" Harry said. \"I\u0027m glad somebody does.\" Harry typed: PpP The reply came: HELLO. \u003d 00032125252632 \"Okay,\" Harry said. \"He\u0027s getting bored. Playtime\u0027s over. Let\u0027s switch to straight English.\" Harry typed: YES . The reply came back: 0004212232 Harry typed: HELLO There was a pause, then: I AM DELIGHTED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE. THE PLEASURE IS ENTIRELY MINE I ASSURE YOU. There was a long silence. Nobody spoke. \"Okay,\" Barnes said, finally. \"Let\u0027s get down to business.\" \"He\u0027s polite,\" Ted said. \"Very friendly.\" \"Unless it\u0027s an act.\" \"Why should it be an act?\" \"Don\u0027t be na?ve,\" Barnes said. Norman looked at the lines on the screen. He had a different reaction from the others - he was surprised to find an expression of emotion. Did this alien have emotions? Probably not, he suspected. The flowery, rather archaic words suggested an adopted tone: Jerry was talking like a character from a historical romance. \"Well, ladies and gentlemen,\" Harry said, \"for the first time in human history, you are on-line with an alien. What do you want to ask him?\" \"His name,\" Barnes said promptly. \"Besides his name, Hal.\" \"There are certainly more profound questions than his name,\" Ted said. \"I don\u0027t understand why you won\u0027t ask him - \" The screen printed: ARE YOU THE ENTITY HECHO IN MEXICO? \"Jesus, where\u0027d he get that?\" \"Maybe there are things on the ship fabricated in Mexico.\" \"Like what?\" \"Chips, maybe.\" ARE YOU THE ENTITY MADE IN THE U.S.A.? \"The guy doesn\u0027t wait for an answer.\" \"Who says he\u0027s a guy?\" Beth said. \"Oh, Beth.\" \"Maybe Jerry is short for Geraldine.\" \"Not now, Beth.\" ARE YOU THE ENTITY MADE IN THE U.S.A.? \"Answer him,\" Barnes said. YES WE ARE. WHO ARE YOU? A long pause, then: WE ARE. \"We are what?\" Barnes said, staring at the screen. \"Hal, take it easy.\" Harry typed, WE ARE THE ENTITIES FROM THE U.S.A. WHO ARE YOU? ENTITIES\u003dENTITY? \"It\u0027s too bad,\" Ted said, \"that we have to speak English. How\u0027re we going to teach him plurals?\" Harry typed, NO. YOU ARE A MANY ENTITY? \"I see what he\u0027s asking. He thinks we may be multiple parts of a single entity.\" \"Well, straighten him out.\" NO. WE ARE MANY SEPARATE ENTITIES. \"You can say that again,\" Beth said. I UNDERSTAND. IS THERE ONE CONTROL ENTITY? Ted started laughing. \"Look what he\u0027s asking!\" \"I don\u0027t get it,\" Barnes said. Harry said, \"He\u0027s saying, \u0027Take me to your leader.\u0027 He\u0027s asking who\u0027s in charge.\" \"I\u0027m in charge,\" Barnes said. \"You tell him.\" Harry typed, YES. THE CONTROL ENTITY IS CAPTAIN HARALD C. BARNES. I UNDERSTAND. \"With an \u0027o,\u0027 \"Barnes said irritably. \"Harold with an \u0027o.\u0027 \" \"You want me to retype it?\" \"Never mind. Just ask him who he is.\" WHO ARE YOU? I AM ONE. \"Good,\" Barnes said. \"So there\u0027s only one. Ask him where he\u0027s from.\" WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
