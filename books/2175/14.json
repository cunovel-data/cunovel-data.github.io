{"id":99317,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Dervish lays Meera on one of the mansion\u0027s many beds. He examines her again, in more detail this time. He tries to wake her by calling her name and gently shaking her. When that fails he goes to the bathroom, comes back with a glass of water, uses his fingers to flick drops at her face. She doesn\u0027t stir.\\n\\n Dervish steps away grimly. \"I could try to bring her round with magic,\" he says, \"but I\u0027m not sure how serious the damage is. I could make it worse.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you just leave her?\" I ask. \"She\u0027ll live, won\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"Then let her sleep. That\u0027ll be best for her, right?\"\\n\\n Dervish stares at me, troubled, then walks out of the room without saying anything. I wrap a blanket over Meera, then close the door on her and head up to the study.\\n\\n After the dark of the cellar, the study seems warmer and brighter than ever. I lose myself in a large leather chair, knees drawn up to my chest, head tucked between them, weary and afraid. Dervish is standing by a chess set. This is his favourite set, the pieces based on characters from The Lord of the Rings. Dervish picks up a brightly painted hobbit figurine and toys with it absently while he speaks.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve ever truly appreciated the complexities of chess,\" he says. \"So few pieces, yet so many possibilities. No two games are ever the same. You can learn the rules in an afternoon, yet spend the rest of your life trying to master them.\"\\n\\n \"Stick chess up your ass!\" I shout, coming alive with fury. \"Bill-E\u0027s chained up in the cellar, twisted and insane. Meera\u0027s unconscious, maybe comatose. And all you can warble on about - \"\\n\\n \"Lord Loss plays chess,\" Dervish interrupts quietly. \"The Demonata are not, by nature, playful creatures, but he\u0027s an exception. I don\u0027t know where or when he acquired his hunger for the game, but by the time Bartholomew Garadex met him, he was a committed player, albeit one of limited experience.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s this going?\" I grumble, though I have an idea.\\n\\n \"When you walked in on your parents, did you notice any chess boards?\"\\n\\n Breathing thinly. Thinking back. The blood. Web-like walls. The demons. And, on the floor, scattered chess pieces, broken boards. Plus the gouged board in the study.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I sigh.\\n\\n Dervish talks swiftly. \"Bartholomew played many games with Lord Loss while trying to persuade him to help lift the curse. His familiars weren\u0027t allowed to pester Bartholomew at the chess board, so it was the safest way to conduct a conversation with Lord Loss. Over time he noticed that Lord Loss cared almost as much about chess as he did about feeding on humanity\u0027s sorrow.\\n\\n \"On a hunch, old Bart severed connections with the demon master and avoided him for several months. When he finally crossed the divide to the Demonata\u0027s universe again, Lord Loss was surly and irritable, eager to resume play.\\n\\n \"Bartholomew refused.\" Dervish chuckles drily. \"It\u0027s dangerous, riling a demon. They can be abominable angels of destruction when offended. Lord Loss could have unleashed all of his familiars upon old Bart, which would have been - \"\\n\\n \"He has others as well as Artery and Vein?\" I snap.\\n\\n \"Oh yes,\" Dervish says. \"They\u0027re just his current favourites. He has hundreds of familiars. If he\u0027d sicced them on Bartholomew, they\u0027d have torn him limb from limb, and all the magic in the world couldn\u0027t have repelled them.\\n\\n \"But, as old Bart had gambled, Lord Loss didn\u0027t send the demons in. As intense as his anger was, his fascination with chess proved stronger. Instead of crushing Bartholomew, he whined and complained and tried to bargain. So Bartholomew struck for gold. He told Lord Loss he wouldn\u0027t play unless the demon master lifted the curse of the Garadexes.\\n\\n \"No bite. Chess was an obsession, but it wasn\u0027t that precious to him. So old Bart tried another approach. He proposed a series of contests in which he\u0027d play for the lives of individual family members. After lengthy discussions, they agreed to stage a number of matches, best of five games per match. For each match that Bartholomew won, Lord Loss would cure a Garadex. But if Bartholomew ever lost, Lord Loss would take possession of his soul.\\n\\n \"And so the contests commenced, two or three games per week - Lord Loss set the rate. According to Bartholomew\u0027s records, Lord Loss hated losing. Like most of the Demonata, he\u0027s despisingly proud. They consider themselves superior to humans, and to lose to one - at anything - is a great disgrace.\\n\\n \"Yet lose he did.\" Dervish chuckles throatily. \"Bartholomew gave his time over entirely to chess, playing for hours on end each day and night, with the best opponents he could find, learning and improving. He lost six games in the first three months - then never again. He hit a fifty-nine game winning streak, which showed no sign of ending.\\n\\n \"And then he died.\"\\n\\n Dervish shrugs. \"He was old, and his earlier battles with Lord Loss\u0027s familiars had drained him. It was peaceful in the end - he passed away in his sleep.\"\\n\\n \"What happened then?\" I ask, absorbed in the story.\\n\\n \"For a long time, nothing,\" Dervish says. \"Nobody in our family knew of Bartholomew\u0027s matches with Lord Loss. He never told them how he was affecting the cures. Several Garadexes were witches and wizards, but they were unable to unlock the secrets of his diaries, which he\u0027d encoded with strong spells.\\n\\n \"Eventually, almost forty years after the great magician\u0027s death, Davey McKay - a distant relative who\u0027d lost four of his five children to the curse decoded the diary and discovered the demonic secret. He immediately contacted Lord Loss in an attempt to renew the contests and reverse the change in his youngest child, who was just starting to transform.\\n\\n \"The demon master was slow to respond. Bartholomew had humiliated him. He was wary of suffering another string of defeats at the hands of a human. Also, Davey wasn\u0027t a magician - his soul was of only minor interest to Lord Loss. But Davey was resourceful. He sought a twist to spike Lord Loss\u0027s imagination, a challenge which would appeal to his warped sensibilities.\"\\n\\n Dervish lapses into a thoughtful silence. He\u0027s still playing with the hobbit chess piece. With his free hand, he pulls open a drawer and takes out a photo. Slides it across the desk. I look - Mum, Dad, Gret and me. A snap taken on one of Dad\u0027s birthdays.\\n\\n \"Davey\u0027s solution was dreadful,\" Dervish says as I stare at the photo, \"but it had to be. Lord Loss wasn\u0027t interested in anything less. The rules he proposed were - one match, best of five games, like before. If Davey won, his son would have his humanity restored, and both would be free. But if Lord Loss won, he could kill both Davey and the child.\\n\\n \"Lord Loss was keen on Davey\u0027s idea, but he added a few kinks of his own. When playing Bartholomew, he\u0027d told his familiars to stand at bay. He refused to grant Davey that privilege. Somebody would have to partner Davey and fight the demons while he played. As long as Davey\u0027s protector lived, the familiars wouldn\u0027t attack Davey. But if his partner was killed they\u0027d be free to slaughter Davey and his son too.\\n\\n \"Another new rule was that the games had to be played simultaneously, in a single sitting - to heap the pressure on Davey and his partner. And his final clause - if Davey won, he\u0027d have to enter Lord Loss\u0027s realm and fight him personally for possession of his soul.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" I mutter, not catching the meaning of the last part.\\n\\n \"The games take place between the Demonata\u0027s universe and ours,\" Dervish explains. \"You probably noticed in your parents\u0027 room that there were bits of our world as well as bits of Lord Loss\u0027s. That in-between state was where Davey would challenge Lord Loss. If Davey won, his son would be cured, and the boy and Davey\u0027s partner could get on with their lives. But Davey would have to enter Lord Loss\u0027s world and fight the demon master on his home turf. If he beat him, he\u0027d walk free. But if he lost, Lord Loss would take control of his soul, and he\u0027d live out his remaining days as a zombie.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like a raw deal to me,\" I grunt.\\n\\n \"It was,\" Dervish agrees. \"But those were the terms. Davey had to agree.\" Dervish pauses, then says softly, \"Davey lost. His brother stood as his partner. The demons overwhelmed him. Davey was killed before even one of the games was decided. His son too. All three were ripped to pieces by the demons.\"\\n\\n He takes the photo from me and gazes at it in heavy silence.\\n\\n \"But Davey\u0027s sacrifice wasn\u0027t in vain,\" he resumes. \"Lord Loss developed a taste for this new contest. He approached Davey\u0027s relatives - those with magical powers - offering them the chance to compete for lives as Davey had.\\n\\n \"Most refused. But two - both with young children on the verge of turning - accepted the challenge. One was defeated - but the other won. His victory gave hope to others, and a series of Garadexes and Gradys have sustained the challenge over the long decades since. Some win, some lose. Most who win subsequently lose their souls in the ensuing battle in Lord Loss\u0027s realm, but a few have made the journey back, proof that it can be done.\"\\n\\n Dervish lays the photo back in the drawer and closes it slowly. He blinks owlishly and wipes a hand across his eyes - he\u0027s fighting back tears.\\n\\n \"Your parents didn\u0027t win,\" he says. \"Gret was infected. Your father and mother challenged Lord Loss. One of them proved inadequate to the task. All three died as a result. I was meant - \"\\n\\n His voice catches and he turns away, rubbing his eyelids, trembling with emotion. \"Your father and I had an agreement,\" he says bleakly. \"If any of his children succumbed to the disease, I was to be his partner. I thought he was wrong to have children, but I loved him, and I loved the kids he fathered. I wasn\u0027t going to stand to one side in their hour of need.\"\\n\\n \"Then why weren\u0027t you there?\" I cry, tears streaming down my cheeks.\\n\\n \"He never told me Gret was changing,\" he croaks. \"Your mother must have convinced him to let her face the demons with him. I\u0027m sure Sharon had Gret\u0027s best interests at heart, but I was a better chess player, and a much stronger fighter. Cal should have held me to my promise. He should have called. Maybe I could have...\"\\n\\n He breaks down. His eyes close. His hands clench into fists. Then he raises his face to the ceiling and howls. From the secret cellar I imagine I hear an echoing howl, as the transformed Bill-E Spleen pauses during feeding and answers his uncle\u0027s tortured call.\\n\\n I stop crying before Dervish does. I don\u0027t think he cries very often, so he has a hard time regaining control. When the tears finally cease and he\u0027s wiping his face clean with a denim sleeve, I put an accusation to him as softly as I can. \"Are you saying it was Mum\u0027s fault?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not!\" he answers promptly.\\n\\n \"But if Dad had picked you instead of her...\"\\n\\n Dervish hesitates, choosing his words carefully. \"I\u0027ve got to be truthful - I was the logical choice. But logic and magic don\u0027t always mix. Sometimes amateurs fare better than professionals. Nobody ever really knows how they\u0027ll fare until they put themselves on the spot.\"\\n\\n He pulls out a handkerchief and blows his nose. \"In the end, it\u0027s all relative. Your father chose - rightly or wrongly - and the outcome stands. We can\u0027t change the past and we\u0027d be fools if we tried.\\n\\n \"But whatever my personal feelings about his choice,\" Dervish adds, \"don\u0027t ever think I believe it was your mother\u0027s fault. It wasn\u0027t. It was our curse, not hers. She deserves nothing short of absolute love and respect for taking on that curse, and laying her life on the line to try and avert it.\"\\n\\n I nod slowly, thinking it over. \"But if they hadn\u0027t laid their lives on the line,\" I whisper. \"If they\u0027d called in the Lambs and not gone to Lord Loss...\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027d be alive.\" Dervish says it bluntly. \"That\u0027s why I said you might not like the truth. They put Gret\u0027s life before their own - and yours. If they hadn\u0027t interfered, you\u0027d have lost a sister but kept your parents.\"\\n\\n I stare at him uncertainly, my lower lip trembling, part of me hating Mum and Dad for putting me through this, another part hating Gret, blaming her for the mess.\\n\\n Dervish reads my thoughts and shakes his head calmly. \"Don\u0027t go down that road, Grubbs,\" he says. \"Cal and Sharon did what they had to. They\u0027d have done the same for you if you\u0027d been infected. I know you feel cheated. I know you want them back. But if you look deep inside, and recall the people they were, the love they had for you and Gret, you\u0027ll understand why they did it.\"\\n\\n \"They should have told me,\" I moan. \"They cut me out completely. I could have helped. I - \"\\n\\n \"No,\" Dervish says firmly. \"The rules are clear - only two may challenge Lord Loss and his familiars. Telling you would have achieved nothing.\"\\n\\n \"It would have prepared me for the worst,\" I disagree.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think they wanted to think about that,\" Dervish sighs. \"Doubts have a way of eating a person from the inside out. Most who face Lord Loss choose not to focus on all that can go wrong, because it makes it more likely that something will go wrong.\"\\n\\n \"But - \" I begin.\\n\\n \"Grubbs,\" Dervish interrupts curtly, \"we can sit here arguing all night. But that won\u0027t bring your parents and Gret back. And it won\u0027t help Billy. Letting go isn\u0027t easy, but you have to forget about your parents for a while. If you can\u0027t, you\u0027re no good to me.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027No good to you\u0027?\" I echo, frowning. \"What are you talking about? What do you want me to do?\"\\n\\n Dervish leans forward, his features impassive. \"I want you to be my second,\" he says. \"I want you to stand by my side and battle Vein and Artery while I challenge Lord Loss at chess.\"\\n\\n The world goes numb. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-14.html","bookId":2175,"book":{"id":2175,"title":"Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)","description":"Storyline: Lord Loss (The Demonata #1) \\n Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies.
