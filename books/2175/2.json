{"id":99305,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Blood everywhere. Nightmarish splashes and gory pools. Wild streaks across the floor and walls.\n Except the walls aren\u0027t walls. I\u0027m surrounded on all four sides by webs. Millions of strands, thicker than my arm, some connecting in orderly designs, others running chaotically apart. Many of the strands are stained with blood. Behind the layer of webs, more layers - banks of them stretching back as far as I can see. Infinite.\n My eyes snap from the walls. I make quick, mental thumbnails of other details. Numb. Functioning like a machine.\n The dripping sound - a body hanging upside down from the webby ceiling in the centre of the room. No head. Blood drops to the floor from the gaping red O of the neck. Even without the head, I recognise him.\n \"DAD!\" I scream, and the cry almost rips my vocal chords apart.\n To my left, an obscene creature spins round and snarls. It has the body of a very large dog, the head of a crocodile. Beneath it, motionless - Mum. Or what\u0027s left of her.\n A dreadful howl to my right. Gret! Sitting on the floor, staring at me, weaving sideways, her face white, except where it\u0027s smeared with blood. I start to call to her. She half-turns and I realise that she\u0027s been split in two. Something\u0027s behind her, in the cavity at the back, moving her like a hand-puppet.\n The \u0027something\u0027 pushes Gret away. It\u0027s a child, but no child of this world. It has the body of a three-year-old, with a head much larger than any normal person\u0027s. Pale green skin. No eyes - a small ball of fire flickers in each of its empty sockets. No hair - yet its head is alive with movement. As the hell-child advances, I see that the objects are cockroaches. Living. Feeding on its rotten flesh.\n The crocodile-dog moves away from Mum and also closes in on me, exchanging glances with the monstrous child, who\u0027s narrowing the gap.\n I can\u0027t move. Fear has seized me completely. I look from Mum to Dad to Gret. All red. All dead.\n Impossible! This isn\u0027t happening! A bad dream - it must be!\n But even in my very worst nightmare, I never imagined anything like this. I know that it\u0027s real, simply because it\u0027s too awful not to be.\n The creatures are almost upon me. The croc-dog growls hungrily. The hell-child grins ghoulishly and raises its hands - there are mouths in both its palms, small, full of sharp teeth. No tongues.\n \"Oh dear,\" someone says, and the creatures stop within spitting distance. \"What have we here?\"\n A man slides out from behind a clump of webby strands. Thin. Pale red skin, misshapen, lumpy, as though made out of coloured dough. His hands are mangled, bones sticking out of the skin, one finger melting into another. Bald. Strange eyes - no white, just a dark red iris and an even darker pupil. There\u0027s a gaping, jagged hole in the left side of his chest. I can look clean through it. Inside the hole - snakes. Dozens of tiny, hissing, coiled serpents, with long curved fangs.\n The hell-child shrieks and reaches towards me. The teeth in its small mouths are eagerly snapping open and shut.\n \"Stop, Artery,\" the man - the monster - says commandingly, and steps towards me. No... he doesn\u0027t step... he glides. He has no feet. The lumpy flesh of his lower legs ends in sharp strips which don\u0027t touch the floor. He\u0027s hovering in the air.\n The croc-dog barks savagely, its reptilian eyes alive with hunger and hate.\n \"Hold, Vein,\" the monster orders. He advances to within touching distance of me. Stops and studies me with his unnatural red eyes. He has a small mouth. White lips. He looks sad - the saddest creature I\u0027ve ever seen.\n \"You are Grubitsch,\" he says morosely. \"The last of the Gradys. You should not be here. Your parents wished to spare you this heartache. Why did you come?\"\n I can\u0027t answer. My body isn\u0027t my own, except my eyes, which don\u0027t stop roaming and analysing, even though I want them to - easier to shut off completely and black everything out.\n The hell-child makes a guttural sound and reaches for me again.\n \"Disobey me at your peril, Artery,\" the monster says softly. The barbaric baby drops its hands and shuffles backwards, the fire in its eyes dimming. The croc-dog retreats too. Both keep their sights on me.\n \"Such sadness,\" the monster sighs, and there\u0027s genuine pity in his tone. \"Parents - dead. Sister - dead. All alone in the world. Face to face with demons. No idea who we are or why we\u0027re here.\" He pauses and doubt crosses his expression. \"You don\u0027t know, do you, Grubitsch? Nobody ever explained, or told you the story of lonely Lord Loss?\"\n I still can\u0027t answer, but he reads the ignorance in my eyes and smiles thinly, painfully. \"I thought not,\" he says. \"They sought to protect you from the cruelties of the world. Good, loving parents. You\u0027ll miss them, Grubitsch - but not for long.\" The creatures to my left and right make sick, chuckling sounds. \"Your sorrow shall be short-lived. Within minutes I\u0027ll set my familiars upon you and all will soon finish. There will be pain great pain - but then the total peace of the beyond. Death will come as a blessing, Grubitsch. You will welcome it in the end - as your parents and sister did.\"\n The monster drifts around me. I realise he has no nose, just two large holes above his upper lip. He sniffs as he passes, and I somehow understand that he\u0027s smelling my fear.\n \"Poor Grubitsch,\" he murmurs, stopping in front of me again. This close, I can see that his red skin is broken by tiny cracks, seeping with drops of blood. I also notice several appendages beneath his arms - three on either side, folded around his stomach. They look like thin, extra arms, though they might just be oddly moulded layers of flesh.\n \"Wh-wh... what... are... you?\" I moan, forcing the words out between my chattering teeth.\n \"The beginning and end of your greatest sorrows,\" the monster replies. He says it plainly - not a boast.\n \"Mu-Mum?\" I gasp. \"Dad? Gr-Gr... Gr...\"\n \"Gone,\" he whispers, shaking his head, blood oozing from the cracks in his neck. \"Remember them, Grubitsch. Recall the golden memories. Cherish them in these, your final moments. Cry for them, Grubitsch. Give me your tears.\"\n He smiles eagerly and his right hand reaches for my face. He brushes his mashed-together fingers across my left cheek, just beneath my eye, as though trying to charm tears from me.\n The touch of his skin - moist, rough, sticky - repels me. Without thinking, I turn my back on the hell of my parents\u0027 bedroom and run. Behind me, the monster chuckles darkly, clears his throat and says, \"Vein. Artery. He is yours.\"\n With vile, vicious howls of delight, the creatures give chase.\n The landing. Growls and grinding teeth getting closer every second. Almost upon me. My legs slip. I sprawl to the floor. Something flies overhead and collides with the wall at the top of the stairs - the croc-dog, Vein.\n A tiny hand snags on my left ankle. Artery\u0027s teeth close on the turn-ups of my jeans. I pull away instinctively. Ripping - a long strip of material torn clean away. No damage to my leg. Artery rolls backwards, choking on the denim.\n Vein scrambles to its feet, shaking its elongated crocodile\u0027s head. My eyes fix on its legs. They don\u0027t end in dog\u0027s paws, but in tiny human hands, with long, blood-stained, splintered nails - a woman\u0027s.\n I wriggle past Vein on my stomach and drag myself down the stairs, gasping with terror. Out of the corner of my eye I spy Artery spitting out the denim, jumping to his feet, rushing after me.\n Vein crouches at the top of the stairs, reptilian eyes furious, readying itself - herself - to pounce. Just as she leaps, Artery crashes into her. Vein yelps as her companion accidentally crushes her against the wall. Artery wails like a baby, kicks Vein out of the way, and totters down the stairs in pursuit of me.\n My hands hit the floor. I lurch to my feet and start for the front door. I\u0027ve a good lead on Artery, who\u0027s still on the stairs. I\u0027m going to make it! A few more strides and...\n Something brushes between my legs at an incredible speed. There\u0027s a sharp clattering sound. The door shakes. At its base, Artery rights himself and grins at me. The grotesque hell-child is rubbing his right shoulder, where he collided with the door. The fire in his eyes burns brighter than ever. His mouth is wide and twisted. No tongue - just a gaping, blood-red maw.\n I scream incoherently at Artery, then grab the telephone from its stand - the closest object to hand - and lob it with all my strength at the demon. Artery ducks sharply. Unbelievably, the telephone smashes through the door, ending up in the street outside.\n I\u0027ve no time to ponder this impossible feat of strength. Artery\u0027s momentarily disorientated. Vein\u0027s only halfway down the stairs. I can escape - if I act quickly.\n Making a sharp turn, I dive for the kitchen and the back door. Artery reads my intentions and bellows at Vein. The croc-dog leaps from the stairs and sails for my face and throat. I bring up an arm and swat her away. Vein\u0027s nails catch on my arm, rip through the material of my shirt and make three deep gouges in the flesh of my forearm.\n Yelling with pain, I kick out at the demon\u0027s crocodile head. My foot hits it just beneath the tip of its snout. Vein\u0027s head snaps back and she tumbles away with a grunt.\n I don\u0027t stop to check on Artery. I burst through to the kitchen and throw myself at the door. My fingers tighten on the handle. I twist - the wrong way! Reverse the movement. A click. The door opens...\n ... and slams shut again as Artery rams it. The force of the demon banging into the door knocks me aside. I roll out of harm\u0027s immediate way. When I sit up, Artery has recovered and is standing in front of the door, legs and arms spread, three sets of teeth glinting in the glow of the red light cast by the fire of his eyeless sockets.\n I back away on my knees from the green-skinned hell-child. Stop - growling to my rear. A panicked glance. Vein closing in, blocking my retreat.\n I\u0027m caught between them.\n Artery\u0027s smiling. He knows I\u0027m finished. A cockroach topples from his head, lands on its back, rights itself. It starts to scuttle away. Artery steps on the roach and crushes it. Holds his foot up to me, so that I can see the insect\u0027s smeared remains. Laughs evilly.\n A snapping sound behind me. The stench of blood and decay. Vein almost upon me. Artery hisses - he wants to join in the bloodshed, but he\u0027s wary. Won\u0027t desert his post. Better to stay and watch Vein kill me than go for the kill himself and leave the door unguarded. I sense the demon\u0027s fear of the one upstairs. He called these two his familiars - that means he\u0027s their master.\n Vein butts me in the back with her leathery snout. Growls throatily. It\u0027s over. I\u0027m finished. Dead, like Mum and Dad and...\n \"No!\" I roar, startling the demons. My thoughts flash on the telephone smashing through the sturdy wood of the front door, and Artery and the speed with which he moved. My eyes fix on the dog flap. Much too small to fit through, but I don\u0027t think of that. I focus only on escape.\n I bring my legs up. Come to a half-crouch. Propel myself at the dog flap as Vein snaps for me with her teeth. I fly through the air, faster than any human should or could. The fire in Artery\u0027s sockets flares with alarm. The demon snaps his tiny legs together. Too late! Before they close, I\u0027m through, fingers pushing the dog flap up out of the way, arms, body and legs following. Shrieks and howls behind. But they can\u0027t harm me now. I\u0027m flying... outside... free!\n Soaring. Arms spread like wings. Exhilaration. Magic. Momentary delight. I feel invincible, like a -\n Smash!\n The backyard fence cuts short my flight. I hit the ground hard. Come up groaning and wheezing. Right elbow cut where I rocketed off the rough wood of the fence. Woozy. I stagger to my feet. Feel sick.\n I remember the demons. My eyes snap to the dog flap. I turn to run...\n ...then stop. No sign of them. Ordinary night silence.\n They aren\u0027t following.\n I stare at the dog flap - tiny - then at my arms and legs. The three red ravines gouged out by Vein. My shirt and jeans ripped from where the demons snagged me. My left shoe missing - it must have come off mid-flight. But otherwise I\u0027m unharmed.\n No way! Even if the dog flap had been bigger, I couldn\u0027t have dived through it at that speed without scraping myself raw. How did...?\n All questions die unvoiced as I recall the horror show of the bedroom.\n \"Mum,\" I sob, staggering towards the back door. I pause with my hand on the handle. Almost turn it. Can\u0027t.\n I get down on my knees. Cautiously poke open the dog flap. Peer into the kitchen. No demons - but the many bloody prints on the tiles are proof I didn\u0027t imagine the chase.\n On my feet. Again I try to enter. Again I can\u0027t bring myself to do it. Memories too terrifying. The demons too threatening. If I could help my family, perhaps it would be different. But they\u0027re dead, all of them, and I have too much sense (or not enough courage) to risk my life for a trio of corpses.\n Stepping back from the door, I stare up at the house. It looks like all the others from the outside. No webs. No blood. Normal walls and windows.\n \"Gret,\" I mutter mindlessly. \"I never said sorry for the rat guts.\"\n I think about that for a moment, stunned, sluggish. Then I raise my face, open my mouth and scream.\n It\u0027s a wordless scream. Pure hatred. Pure sorrow. It builds from somewhere deep within me and bursts forth with the same impossible force I summoned when lobbing the telephone at Artery and diving through the dog flap.\n The glass in the windows shatters and explodes inwards, ripping curtains to shreds, littering floors with jagged, transparent shards. The glass in the houses to either side also explodes. And in the nearby cars and street lamps.\n I scream as long as I can - perhaps a full minute without pause - then lapse into a silence as all-encompassing as the scream. It\u0027s an isolated silence. Almost solid. No sounds trickle out and none penetrate.\n After a while people emerge from the neighbouring houses, shaken, making their cautious way to the source of the insane howl. I see their mouths moving, but I don\u0027t hear their questions, or their cries when they enter my house and come racing out shortly after, faces white, eyes filled with terror.\n I\u0027m in a world of my own. A world of webs and blood. Demons and corpses. Nightmares and terror. The name of the world from this night on - home. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-2.html","bookId":2175,"book":{"id":2175,"title":"Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Lord Loss (The Demonata #1) \n Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies.
