{"id":99308,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"I don\u0027t expect to get much sleep the first night - new surroundings, new bed, new life - but surprisingly I drop off within minutes of climbing underneath the covers of the small first-floor bed I chose, and don\u0027t wake until close to ten in the morning. I feel good as I use the en suite bathroom. Refreshed. The sun\u0027s broken through the clouds and is shining directly on to my bed when I come out of the bathroom. I lie on the covers and bask in the rays, smiling softly. For a moment I think of Gret\u0027s en suite... the rat guts... the start of the nightmares. But I\u0027m in too good a mood to dwell on all that. Shaking my thoughts free, I head downstairs for a late breakfast. I\u0027m finishing off my cornflakes and munching my third slice of toast when Dervish enters through the back door. He\u0027s been jogging. Red-faced, sweaty, panting. \"I looked in... on you... earlier,\" he gasps, rolling his neck around, jiggling his arms and legs. \"Didn\u0027t have the heart... to wake you.\" \"I don\u0027t normally sleep this late,\" I grin guiltily. \"I should hope not.\" He stretches, holds his hands over his head while he counts to ten, then relaxes, pulls up a chair and sits. \"Any plans for today?\" \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I admit nervously. \"I\u0027m used to having nurses plan my days for me.\" \"I\u0027ve been thinking about school,\" Dervish says. \"Ideally I\u0027d like to get you started quickly, but they\u0027re midway through term. You\u0027d be playing catch-up from the second you sat down. I think it\u0027d be easier if we waited until after the summer, when you can go in fresh with the rest of the class.\" \"OK.\" I\u0027m relieved - I was dreading the return to school. \"If you want, I can give you some lessons, or we can enroll you for private tuition,\" Dervish continues. \"You\u0027ve missed a lot, and I suspect you\u0027ll have to repeat a year, but if you work hard over the summer...\" \"I\u0027m not worried about repeating,\" I mutter. \"If I was at my old school, I\u0027d want to move up with my friends. But since I\u0027m starting fresh, it doesn\u0027t really matter which class I go into.\" \"I like the way you think,\" Dervish smiles. \"OK, we\u0027ll lay off the heavy grinds, but fit the odd bit of learning in along the way - you\u0027ll get rusty if you don\u0027t keep your brain sharp.\" \"What about today?\" I ask. \"What should I do?\" \"Get the lay of the land,\" Dervish suggests. \"Explore the house. Have a look round the grounds and neighbouring fields - you won\u0027t get done for trespassing as long as you don\u0027t mess with the livestock. Maybe take a stroll to the village and let the gossips have a gawk - I\u0027m sure they\u0027re dying to check out the new boy. You can start on the household chores tomorrow.\" \"Chores?\" \"Sweeping, cleaning, stuff like that.\" \"Oh.\" I glance around. \"I thought... a place this big... you\u0027d have a maid or something.\" \"No maid!\" Dervish laughs. \"I have a woman who comes in once a fortnight to dust the bedrooms, but that\u0027s it as far as outside help goes. You\u0027ll have to earn your keep here, Grubbs m\u0027boy! But we\u0027ll start with the slave labour tomorrow, like I said. Find your feet first. Take it easy. Enjoy.\" He rises and his expression saddens. \"Hell, you\u0027re due some enjoyment after all you\u0027ve been through.\" I do the village first. Carcery Vale is quaint, quiet, picturesque. Nice white or creamy houses, smiling people, the occasional car puttering down the main street. I walk through the village, familiarising myself with the layout. I pass the school - larger than I thought. It\u0027s lunch and the students are in the yard, shouting, laughing, playing football. I don\u0027t get close. Nervous. I\u0027ve had months of dealing strictly with adults. I\u0027ve almost forgotten what people my own age are like and how to get along with them. Not many shops, and a very limited selection of goods. I need new clothes, but socks and underpants are all the local stores have to offer. I suppose there\u0027s a town within easy driving distance where Dervish can take me. I\u0027ll ask when I get back. The people in the shops and on the streets eye me curiously but without suspicion. I keep expecting them to ask for my name or pass a comment - \"You must be Mr. Grady\u0027s new lodger,\" or \"You\u0027re not from around here, are you?\" - but they just nod pleasantly and let me go about my business. Early afternoon. Wandering around the mansion. Checking out the rooms. I knew the instant I arrived that this was a monster of a house, but it\u0027s only today that I realise just how enormous it is. It doesn\u0027t have a single modest inch or nook to it. Everything\u0027s overblown and over the top. I feel out of place. I\u0027m used to ordinary terrace houses, wallpaper from chain stores, furniture bought from glossy catalogues, paperback bestsellers and brand-name reference guides on the bookshelves. But as awkward as I feel in this massive, ornate old house, I\u0027m not scared. Although it reeks of history, and is full of barbaric weapons and grotesque items like the piranha tank, I\u0027m not frightened. I don\u0027t get shivers down my spine strolling through the corridors (some longer than the street where I used to live). I don\u0027t imagine monsters lurking under the beds, or demons cackling in the shadows. This house is safe. I\u0027m protected within these walls. I don\u0027t know how I know - I just do. The hall of portraits. I\u0027ve been here fifteen, maybe twenty minutes, studying the faces of my relatives. Most are strangers, faded faces from the long-forgotten past - many of them young, just teenagers - but some are familiar. I spot Grandad Grady, my great-aunt Martha, a few cousins I met when I was younger - all of whom have died during the course of my short life. I look for my picture but I\u0027m not among them. Dad and Gret are though, in new frames. Recent photos. I remember the day they were taken, last summer, when we were on holiday in Italy. No photo of Mum. I go through them all again, but she isn\u0027t here. The two of us are missing. Shopping for clothes, twenty miles from Carcery Vale, in a large mall. Lots of people and noise. I feel lost in the crowd. Dervish sticks close by me, sensing my nervousness. Kebabs when we\u0027ve finished shopping. Hot and juicy. Dervish nibbles slowly at his, delicately. I finish long before him. Slurping down the last of my Coke. Studying him as he eats. Wondering if I should mention Mum\u0027s and my absence from the hall of portraits. \"An unasked question is the most futile thing in the world,\" Dervish says, startling me. Doesn\u0027t look up. Swallows his food. Waits. \"I was looking at the photos and portraits in the hall today,\" I begin. \"And you want to know why there are so many teenagers.\" I frown. \"No. I mean, I noticed that, but it was Mum and me I was curious about. You have photos of Dad and Gret, but not us.\" \"Oh.\" He grimaces. \"My faux pas. Most people ask about the teens. The photos and portraits are all of dead family members. I like to frame them as they looked at the end of their lives, so most of the photos were taken shortly before the subject\u0027s death. We have a tragic family history - lots of us have been killed young - which is why there are so many pubescents up there.\" He wipes around his mouth with a napkin, carefully balls it up and lays it aside. \"As for why Sharon hasn\u0027t been included, it\u0027s simple - no in-laws. Everybody on those walls is a blood relative. It\u0027s a family tradition. But I\u0027ve lots of photos of her, as well as Cal and Gret, in albums that you\u0027re free to browse through.\" \"Maybe later,\" I smile. \"I just wanted to make sure you didn\u0027t have any underhand reasons for not including us with the others.\" \"Everything\u0027s above board with me, Grubbs,\" Dervish says, then sips from his mug of coffee without taking his eyes off me. \"Well - almost everything.\" Late. Close to midnight. In my pyjamas. No slippers - I left my old pair at the hospital and I forgot to buy new ones today. The stone floor\u0027s cold. I have to keep moving my toes to keep them warm. I\u0027m drawn back to the hall of portraits. Studying them in moonlight, the faces mostly concealed by shadows. Focusing on the teenagers. Dozens of them, all my age or slightly older. Wondering why the faces of the dead teens fascinate me, and why I feel uneasy. I\u0027m back in my room, in bed, before the answer strikes and drives all hope of sleep away in a flash. In the restaurant, Dervish didn\u0027t simply say that many of our family members had died young - he said they\u0027d been killed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-5.html","bookId":2175,"book":{"id":2175,"title":"Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)","description":"Storyline: Lord Loss (The Demonata #1) Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies.
