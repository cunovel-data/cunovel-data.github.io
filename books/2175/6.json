{"id":99309,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Settling in. Daily chores - washing-up after meals, sweeping a different couple of floors each day, polishing the furniture in one of the large halls or rooms. Lots of other, less regular jobs - taking out the garbage, cleaning windows, running errands in the village.\\n\\n I enjoy the work. It keeps me busy. Not much else to do here apart from play chess with Dervish, watch TV - Dervish has a massive 55 inch widescreen set, which he hardly ever uses! - and read. Chess doesn\u0027t thrill me - Dervish is like Mum and Dad, a chess fanatic, and beats me easily each time we play. I\u0027d as soon not play at all, but he gently presses me to work on my game. I don\u0027t get my family\u0027s obsession with chess, but I guess I\u0027ll just have to bear it here like I did at home.\\n\\n I read more than I normally do - I\u0027m not big on \u0027litrachoor\u0027 - but Dervish doesn\u0027t have a great collection of modern fiction. I pick up a few new books in the Vale, and order some more over the Internet, but I\u0027m not spoilt for choice. I try some of the thousands of occult books littering the shelves, figuring they\u0027ve got to be better than watching the moon all night, but they\u0027re too complicated or densely written to be of interest.\\n\\n So that leaves me with the TV - an endless stream of soap operas, chat shows, movies, sitcoms, sports programmes. And while I never thought I\u0027d admit such a thing, TV does get a bit boring after a while, if it\u0027s all you have to keep yourself amused.\\n\\n But, hey, it\u0027s a million times better than the institute!\\n\\n A week passes. At ease with the house. Getting to know Dervish, though he\u0027s a hard one to figure. Kind, thoughtful, caring - but aloof, with a warped sense of humour. He came in one day while I was watching the news. Caught a report about a serial killer who\u0027d chopped off and collected his victims\u0027 heads. Commented drily, \"There\u0027s a man determined to get ahead in life.\" Spent the next five minutes doubled over with laughter, while I gazed at him, astonished, and the TV broadcast pictures of bloodbaths and weeping relatives.\\n\\n His thirst for chess is at least equal to that of Dad and Mum, if not more so. He went easy on me to begin with, gently encouraging me to play, treating the games as fun. Now he\u0027s showing his true colours. Insists that I play with him every night and gets irritated when I play badly.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to love the game,\" he told me last night, tossing a captured rook at me with unexpected force. \"Chess is life. You have to love it as you love living. If you don\u0027t...\"\\n\\n He said no more, just stormed out of the room, leaving me at a loss for words, rubbing my cheek where the rook struck. Later, when I\u0027d recovered and was passing him in the hall on my way to bed, I muttered, \"Get a life, you freak!\" The perfect comeback - just an hour too late.\\n\\n He\u0027s got no time for music. I find a grand total of three CDs in the house, all old albums by some group called Led Zeppelin. Doesn\u0027t read fiction. Watches only the occasional documentary on TV. Spends a lot of time on the web, from what I\u0027ve seen when I\u0027ve visited him in his study. But he doesn\u0027t seem to surf or play games - he mostly exchanges e-mails with contacts around the globe, or visits dull-looking encyclopaedic sites.\\n\\n Apart from his books and antiques, chess and jogging, and his e-mail mates, he doesn\u0027t seem to have any hobbies, or any apparent interest in the world beyond this house.\\n\\n There are stables - long abandoned - behind the mansion. I\u0027m exploring one of them, idly toeing through the old nails and horseshoes on the ground in search of some interesting nugget, when somebody raps on the rotten door and startles me out of my skin.\\n\\n \"Peace, hombre,\" the stranger chuckles as I duck and grab a horseshoe for protection. \"I come to greet you, not to eat you - as the cannibal said to the missionary.\"\\n\\n A boy a year or so younger than me enters and sticks out his hand. I stare at it a moment, then shake it. He\u0027s a lot shorter than me, chubby, with black hair and a lazy left eye which hangs half-closed. Wearing a faded pair of jeans and an old Simpsons T-shirt.\\n\\n \"Bill-E Spleen,\" he says, pumping my hand. \"And you\u0027re Grubbs \u0027don\u0027t call me Grubitsch!\u0027 Grady, right?\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" I grin thinly, then repeat his name. \"Billy Spleen?\"\\n\\n \"Bill-E,\" he corrects me, and spells it out. \"Actually, it\u0027s really Billy,\" he confesses, \"but I changed it. I haven\u0027t been able to do it by deed poll yet, but I will when I\u0027m older. There\u0027s nothing wrong with Billy - it\u0027s a hell of a lot better than Grubitsch or Grubbs! - but Bill-E sounds cooler, like a rap star.\"\\n\\n He talks quick and sharp, fingers dancing in the air to accent his words.\\n\\n \"Are you from the village?\" I ask politely.\\n\\n \"Yup - I\u0027m a Valer,\" he yawns, as though it\u0027s the dullest thing in the world. \"I used to live a few miles over - in a cottage smaller than this stable - until Mum died. Then I moved in with my grandparents - \u0027the original Spleens,\u0027 as Mum used to call them. They\u0027re OK, just a bit old-fashioned and strait-laced.\"\\n\\n Bill-E studies the disturbed nails and horseshoes on the ground and grins. \"You won\u0027t find any gold here,\" he chortles. \"I\u0027ve been through these sheds more times than I can count, looking for old Lord Sheftree\u0027s treasure.\"\\n\\n \"Treasure?\" Bill-E\u0027s a little too chummy for my liking - I\u0027ve never been fond of people who come along and immediately start acting as though you\u0027re old friends - but I don\u0027t want to say anything to insult him, at least, not until I know a bit more about him.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know about the treasure?\" He hoots as though I\u0027ve admitted I didn\u0027t know the world was round. \"Lord Sheftree - he owned this place years ago - is supposed to have hidden cases full of treasure somewhere on these grounds. His getaway stash, in case he ever had to make a quick exit and needed some ready cash. He was a real swindler. He used to keep a fish tank full of - \"\\n\\n \" - piranha,\" I interrupt. \"And he fed a baby to them. I know.\"\\n\\n \"Dervish told you?\" Bill-E looks disappointed. \"I love telling that story. Just about everyone in Carcery Vale knows it, so it\u0027s not often that I have the chance to break it to someone new. I\u0027ll kick Dervish\u0027s ass for spoiling it for me.\"\\n\\n \"Excuse me,\" I mutter, exasperated, \"but who the hell are you and what are you doing here?\"\\n\\n Bill-E blinks. \"No need to speak to me like that,\" he sniffs. \"I\u0027m only trying to be friendly.\"\\n\\n \"And I just want to know who you are,\" I respond coolly. \"You come in here, telling me your name and that you know all about me, but I\u0027ve never heard of you before. Are you a relative of Dervish\u0027s? A paperboy? What?\"\\n\\n \"Paperboy!\" he snorts. \"I don\u0027t think Dervish ever bought a paper in his life! If it doesn\u0027t come bound in leather or bat\u0027s wings, packed full of spells and dark incantations, he isn\u0027t interested!\"\\n\\n Bill-E steps to the left, into the light shining through a hole in the roof. \"I\u0027m no relative,\" he says. \"Just a friend. I hang out with Dervish, play chess with him, do some odd jobs. He takes me for rides on his bike in return, and teaches me some spells. Has he taught you any spells yet?\"\\n\\n I shake my head.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re cool,\" he grins. \"I don\u0027t know if most of them really work, but the words you use are wicked. I feel like a real magician when I\u0027m casting them.\"\\n\\n \"Could you teach me some?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"No,\" Bill-E answers promptly. \"That\u0027s the first thing Dervish taught me - only a teacher is allowed to teach. He says if he ever catches me passing on my spells to anybody, he\u0027ll can the lessons and ban me from coming here. And he means it - Dervish isn\u0027t the sort to yank your chain about stuff like that.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m warming to Bill-E Spleen - I like the way he talks about Dervish - but it\u0027s been a while since I made a new friend, so instead of saying something simple, I find myself asking cynically, \"Did Dervish tell you to come chat to me? Are you supposed to be my new best friend?\"\\n\\n Bill-E sneers. \"My friendship can\u0027t be bought or bartered. I usually come over a few evenings every week and at weekends. Dervish asked me to stay away this week, to give you a chance to settle in. I was looking forward to checking you out and showing you around the Vale - as a fellow orphan, I thought we might have stuff in common - but now I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll bother. You\u0027re a bit too up-your-own-ass for my liking. I\u0027ll just go see Dervish and leave you to scurry around out here on your own.\"\\n\\n Bill-E turns to leave in a huff.\\n\\n \"When did your mum die?\" I ask quietly.\\n\\n He stops and squints at me. \"Nearly seven years ago. I was just a kid.\"\\n\\n \"And your dad?\"\\n\\n He smiles crookedly. \"I never knew him. Don\u0027t even know who he was. He\u0027s still alive - I think - so I\u0027m not an official orphan. But I\u0027ve felt like one since Mum died.\"\\n\\n \"My folks only died a few months ago,\" I say. \"It still hurts. A lot. So if I act like a spazz, sorry, but that\u0027s just the way I feel right now.\"\\n\\n Bill-E\u0027s features soften. \"When my mum died, I didn\u0027t speak to anyone except Gran and Grandad for almost a year. If other kids came near, I\u0027d scream and attack them. Their parents stopped them hitting back. One day, in a shop, I tried it on a kid when there was nobody around - he knocked the crap out of me. I was fine after that.\"\\n\\n I offer my chin. \"Take a pop if you want.\"\\n\\n Bill-E pads over, makes a fist, then taps my chin lightly. \"Come on,\" he laughs. \"Let\u0027s go see what whirling Dervish is up to.\"\\n\\n The study. Dervish and Bill-E catching up. Lots of names I don\u0027t recognise. Bill-E talking about school, looking forward to the summer break. Dervish telling him about a new book on Bavarian sorcerers which he bought off the web.\\n\\n \"What about the eye spell?\" Bill-E asks. He looks at me and points to his lazy left eye. \"I\u0027m supposed to have this operated on in a few years, but I\u0027m sure Dervish can conjure up a spell to spare me the hassle.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve asked around,\" Dervish laughs, \"but the great magicians of yore didn\u0027t bother much with drooping eyelids. Besides, magic shouldn\u0027t be used for personal gain, Billy.\" Dervish always refers to Bill-E as Billy. I guess he\u0027s known him so long, he finds it hard to change.\\n\\n \"Tell that to great-great-wotsits Garadex!\" Bill-E snorts. \"He used his magic to make millions, didn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"Bartholomew Garadex was an exception,\" Dervish says.\\n\\n Bill-E treats the study as though it\u0027s his own. Pulls books out and only half-pushes them back. Shoves Dervish out of the way to go surfing on the web. Opens a drawer in the desk to show me the skull of a genuine witch, \"burned at the stake for casting lascivious spells on the virile young men of the community,\" he informs me, waving it around in front of his face, poking his fingers into its empty sockets. Dervish lets Bill-E do as he pleases. Sits back and smiles patiently.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not normally this wound-up,\" Dervish remarks when Bill-E goes to the toilet. \"Your arrival upset him. He\u0027s used to having the run of the house. I think he\u0027s worried that things are going to change now that you\u0027ve moved in.\"\\n\\n \"Why does he come here?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"His mother and I were friends,\" Dervish says. \"She died in a boating accident, leaving Billy in the care of his grandparents.\" He pulls a face. \"All I\u0027ll say about that pair is they\u0027re aptly named - Spleen! A more cantankerous old couple you couldn\u0027t imagine. I felt sorry for Billy, so I started visiting and taking him out on my bike. Ma and Pa Spleen weren\u0027t too keen - they still do everything they can to stop him coming over here - but persistence is something I\u0027m good at. I tend to get my own way when I really want to. The odd persuasion spell helps.\" He winks. I can\u0027t tell if he\u0027s serious or joking.\\n\\n Bill-E returns, shaking water from his hands. \"No towels, Derv,\" he grumbles.\\n\\n Dervish raises an eyebrow at me. \"Fresh towels are your department, aren\u0027t they, Master Grubbs?\"\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" I grimace. \"I forgot.\"\\n\\n \"If I was you, Mr. Grady, sir, I\u0027d sack \u0027im,\" Bill-E says with relish, then laughs and asks Dervish to teach him a new spell.\\n\\n \"Will I make the two of you disappear?\" Dervish asks innocently.\\n\\n \"Yeah!\" Bill-E gasps, face lighting up - then curses as Dervish shoos us out of the room and slams the door shut behind us.\\n\\n The hall of portraits. Bill-E knows the faces and names off by heart. Giving me a lecture, filling me in on my family background. I listen with pretend politeness, only paying attention to the occasional juicy snippet.\\n\\n \"Urszula Garadex - pirate,\" Bill-E intones, tapping the frame of a large canvas portrait. The woman in the picture only has one eye, and three of her fingers are missing, two on her left hand, one on her right. \"A cutthroat. Utterly merciless.\\n\\n \"Augustine Grady. Servant to some prince or other. Cause of death - he got kicked in the head by a horse.\\n\\n \"Justin Plunkton - a banker. Nothing interesting about him.\"\\n\\n And so on.\\n\\n After a while I ask Bill-E about the teenagers and if he knows how they died.\\n\\n \"Dervish doesn\u0027t say much about them,\" he replies. \"I think it\u0027s some ancient family curse. You\u0027ll probably go toes-up any day now.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try hard to take you with me,\" I retort.\\n\\n We come to Dad and Gret. Bill-E pauses curiously. \"These are new. I don\u0027t know who - \"\\n\\n \"My dad and sister,\" I inform him quietly.\\n\\n He winces. \"I should have guessed. Sorry.\" He looks at me questioningly, licks his lips, stares back at the photos.\\n\\n \"An unasked question is the most futile thing in the world,\" I prod him.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s one of Dervish\u0027s sayings,\" he notes. Licks his lips again. \"Do you want to tell me how they died, or is it a secret? I asked Dervish, but he won\u0027t say, and Gran and Grandad don\u0027t know - nobody in the village does.\"\\n\\n My stomach tightens. Flashes of a crocodile-headed dog, a hell-child, their eerie master. \"They were murdered.\"\\n\\n Bill-E\u0027s eyes widen. His lazy left eyelid snaps up as though on elastic bands. \"No bull?\" he gasps.\\n\\n My expression\u0027s dark. \"No bull.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know who did it?\"\\n\\n \"I was there.\"\\n\\n Bill-E gulps deeply. \"When they were being killed?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027d you get away?\"\\n\\n I consider how much I should tell him. Decide to try him with the truth. \"They were murdered by demons. I escaped using magic.\"\\n\\n He frowns. \"If this is a joke...\" Stops when he sees my face. \"Does Dervish know?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"He believes you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. But he\u0027s the only one. Everybody else thinks I\u0027m making it up.\"\\n\\n Bill-E grunts dismissively. \"If Dervish believes you, so do I.\" He turns from the photos and does an odd little shuffling dance, mumbling weird words.\\n\\n \"What was that for?\" I ask, bemused.\\n\\n \"One of Dervish\u0027s spells,\" he says. \"It makes the dead smile. Dervish says it\u0027s important to keep the dead happy. The reason this house isn\u0027t haunted is that Dervish keeps its ghosts laughing.\"\\n\\n \"Rot!\" I bellow.\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" Bill-E grins. \"But I\u0027ve been dancing for years and never been bothered by ghosts. Why stop now and run the risk?\"\\n\\n We watch MTV on the 55 inch widescreen TV, munching popcorn, drinking coke from tall paper cups just like in the cinema.\\n\\n \"The TV was my idea,\" Bill-E brags, the remote control balanced on his left knee. \"Dervish resisted to begin with, but I kept on at him and eventually he bought one.\"\\n\\n \"Does he always cave in to your demands?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"No,\" Bill-E sighs. \"I can wrap Gran and Grandad round my little finger, but Dervish doesn\u0027t crumple. He got the TV because I convinced him it was a good idea - his guests would get good use out of it even if he didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"You and Dervish are close, aren\u0027t you?\" I note.\\n\\n \"Step aside, Sherlock Holmes - there\u0027s a new kid in town!\" Bill-E chuckles, rolling his eyes.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to... like... get between you... or anything,\" I mumble awkwardly.\\n\\n \"You couldn\u0027t if you tried,\" he responds smugly.\\n\\n \"I could!\" I bristle. \"He\u0027s my uncle.\"\\n\\n \"So?\" Bill-E laughs. \"He\u0027s my father!\"\\n\\n I stare at him, stunned.\\n\\n Bill-E looks sheepish. \"I shouldn\u0027t have said that,\" he mutters. \"You won\u0027t tell him, will you?\"\\n\\n \"No... but... I mean...\" I catch my breath. \"You said you didn\u0027t know your father!\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t,\" he says. \"Not officially. But it hardly takes a genius to work it out. He wouldn\u0027t invite me over and make such a fuss of me if we weren\u0027t related. And Gran and Grandad Spleen wouldn\u0027t tolerate his involvement unless they had to, no matter how close a friend of Mum\u0027s he was. Dervish has to be my dad. It\u0027s logic.\\n\\n \"Have you ever asked him?\"\\n\\n Bill-E shakes his head instantly. \"Why spoil it? We get along great the way we are. If the truth ever came out in the open, he might decide to sue for custody.\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t you like that?\" I ask.\\n\\n He shrugs. \"I wouldn\u0027t miss Gran and Grandad that much if I moved in with Dervish,\" he admits. \"I could still go and see them all the time. But if he lost, they might take out a court order to stop him seeing me. I reckon they struck a deal with him when Mum died - he could carry on visiting, or having me over to visit, as long as he never told me who he really was. If I go messing about, it might screw up everything.\"\\n\\n I scratch my head, thinking that over. It all seems a bit complicated to me - Dervish doesn\u0027t strike me as the sort to go in for such subterfuge. But I\u0027m new on the scene. Bill-E has spent most of his life around my uncle. I guess he knows what he\u0027s talking about.\\n\\n \"This makes us cousins - if it\u0027s true,\" I note.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Bill-E giggles, then pokes me in the chest. \"It also makes me his son and rightful heir, so don\u0027t go getting too attached to this place, Grady, because as soon as the old man kicks it, you\u0027re out of here!\"\\n\\n \"Charming!\" I laugh, and dump the last of my popcorn over Bill-E\u0027s head.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" Bill-E shouts, shaking kernels from his head, all over the couch and floor. \"Clean that up!\"\\n\\n \"You clean it,\" I grin wickedly. \"It\u0027s your house...\"\\n\\n Both of us laughing, he chases me up the stairs to my room, lobbing fistfuls of popcorn at my head all the way. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-6.html","bookId":2175,"book":{"id":2175,"title":"Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)","description":"Storyline: Lord Loss (The Demonata #1) \\n Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies.
