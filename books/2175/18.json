{"id":99321,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Vein creeps closer. Artery slithers next to his demonic sister. Both growling softly. My cries die away to a terrified whimper. Watching, sickly fascinated, accepting my doom.\n \"No!\" Dervish roars, and he\u0027s suddenly floating above the demons. Grabs each by the scruff of the neck and hurls them across the width of the cellar, where they crash into webs on the opposite side. He reaches down, grabs my arms and rips me free of the sticky strands. Presses his fingers into my back where the bones broke. A warm surge of power - the bones knit together.\n \"This is unpardonable, Dervish,\" Lord Loss mutters from his place at the chess boards. \"To abandon our game while it\u0027s in progress...\" He tuts disapprovingly. \"You have broken the rules of our agreement. I am now free to summon as many of my familiars as I wish and set them loose upon you and the boys.\"\n \"Wait!\" Dervish roars as Lord Loss rises. \"I\u0027ll return to the game!\"\n \"Too late,\" Lord Loss sighs. \"Besides, what would be the point? Grubitsch is out of his depth. Let us put an end to this sham. You have disappointed me, Dervish, but there will be other Gradys and other matches.\" Lord Loss extends five of his eight arms, picks up Dervish\u0027s kings from each board and starts to crush them.\n \"What if Grubbs plays you?\" Dervish shouts.\n Lord Loss pauses. \"That was not our deal.\"\n \"We\u0027ll make a new deal,\" Dervish hisses. \"The game continues where I left off. Grubbs assumes my position. I pit myself against your beasts.\"\n \"Why should I agree to that?\" Lord Loss asks. \"I have already won.\"\n \"No,\" Dervish disagrees. \"We may have forfeited the game - but you haven\u0027t won. You can take our lives now, quickly, or you can prolong the agony and savour Grubbs\u0027s desperation and sorrow as he loses to you.\"\n Lord Loss\u0027s eyes light up at the mention of desperation and sorrow, but he hesitates before replying. \"What if he doesn\u0027t lose?\" he finally murmurs. \"I will have sacrificed the pleasures of a certain victory for the humiliation of defeat.\"\n \"It\u0027s a gamble,\" Dervish agrees, \"but Grubbs is a poor player. Our chances are slim. Imagine the satisfaction you\u0027ll extract as Grubbs slowly and painfully comes to realise he can\u0027t win.\"\n \"You make it sound almost irresistible.\" Lord Loss smiles thinly. \"But what does the boy think?\"\n Dervish looks questioningly at me. I shake my head uncertainly. \"I just want it over with,\" I sob. \"We\u0027re going to lose anyway - why drag it out?\"\n \"As long as there\u0027s life, there\u0027s hope,\" Dervish replies quietly. \"And it\u0027s not just yourself you\u0027d be playing for - it\u0027s me and Billy too. Will you throw away our lives without a fight?\"\n I stare at my uncle\u0027s cold expression, then at the howling Bill-E in his cage. Wearily, I nod. \"I\u0027ll try,\" I mumble. \"If Lord Loss agrees to it, so will I.\"\n Dervish\u0027s head whips round and he glares at Lord Loss. \"Well?\" he barks. \"Can you match this child\u0027s courage, or will you flee with the easy victory?\"\n Lord Loss rolls the kings around in the stubby layers of flesh at the ends of his arms, considering the proposal. Then, with a smile, he replaces them on the boards. \"Come,\" he says, gesturing to the seat which Dervish vacated.\n Gliding to the floor. Dervish sets me down. Pain flares in my left foot. I ignore it. Hobble forward. Gaze at the five boards, the ranks of white and black pieces, then into the demon master\u0027s cunning eyes.\n Breathing raggedly. Clearing my thoughts. Trying to remember every lesson Dad and Mum ever taught me.\n I sit.\n Instant peacefulness. An unnatural silence. I stare around the cellar, startled. Everything seems to have stopped. Dervish stands motionless, facing the demons, while Bill-E\u0027s frozen at the bars of his cage. Then I realise they are moving - only incredibly slowly.\n \"What happened?\" I gasp.\n \"I have separated our time frame from theirs,\" Lord Loss says. \"It allows us to play without distractions.\"\n I watch as Dervish\u0027s right hand slowly comes up, fingers unfurling, red flames streaking from the tips. Slower than snails, Vein and Artery break to the sides, out of the path of the firebolts.\n \"Come,\" Lord Loss says, tapping the middle board. \"The fight is no longer your concern. Focus on the match.\"\n With an effort I tear my eyes away from Dervish and the demons and stare at the pieces lined up in front of me. Assessing the damage. I immediately note that the game on the far right board is beyond saving - that\u0027s where Lord Loss took Dervish\u0027s queen with a bishop. The game on the centre board also looks like a lost cause, with white down both knights and a bishop.\n \"Depressing, isn\u0027t it?\" Lord Loss sighs, looking more miserable than I feel. \"Dervish was not at his best tonight. His fear for you affected his game. I warned him about that, but he would not listen.\"\n Lord Loss picks up the queen he took from the far right board and toys with it. \"It\u0027s your move, Grubitsch,\" he says, \"but take your time. There is no rush. Study the pieces. Plan a campaign. Search for openings.\"\n I reach towards a rook on the board to my immediate left. Pause. Withdraw my hand without touching the piece. \"Can I move any piece, on any board?\" I ask.\n \"Of course.\"\n I run an eye over the five boards again, then pick up a pawn on the board to my far right and move it forward a space. The battle\u0027s already lost on that board, so I might as well start there and treat it as a warm-up. Hopefully work my worst moves out of my system.\n \"Ah,\" Lord Loss nods. \"A cautious approach. Very wise, young Grubitsch.\" He moves a knight forward and checks my king. \"It will make no difference to the end result, but at least you may lose with some dignity. Perhaps that will provide you with a glimmer of comfort when you and your unfortunate companions roast tonight in the fires of my own personal hell.\"\n It takes Lord Loss nine moves to checkmate me on the far right. When he wins, my king melts into a foul-smelling white puddle. Lord Loss picks up the board, snaps it into pieces and tosses it aside.\n \"Then there were four.\"\n Sweating. Fidgeting. Trying to concentrate on the boards. Eyes constantly flicking to Dervish and the demons, locked in slow-motion combat.\n I\u0027m trying to keep play confined to the board on my left - taking the contest one game at a time - but Lord Loss won\u0027t oblige. He makes a few moves on that board, then switches to another, then another.\n Though I have a free run of the boards, I can\u0027t make more than one move on any board until Lord Loss has replied to it. So, if I make a move on the middle board, and Lord Loss then moves a piece on the board to my far left, I can\u0027t make a second move on the board in the middle - I have to wait for Lord Loss to move one of his pieces on it. He\u0027s tied by the same rules as me, of course, but it feels like the odds are stacked in his favour, as if I\u0027m the only one restricted.\n I\u0027ve played chess like this before, but not often, and not recently. Dad tried me on multi-boards when I was younger, saw I wasn\u0027t able to maintain my focus, so worked on improving my individual game. Perhaps he\u0027d have tested me again when I was older - if he\u0027d lived.\n It\u0027s impossible not to think about my parents and Gret. Did Dad sweat this much when he faced the demon lord? Was Gret half-frozen in time, like Bill-E is now, unaware of what was occurring, but somehow sensing doom? Did Mum lose limbs to the familiars during the fight?\n I move a wizard-shaped rook across the middle board. The game here seems lost, but I\u0027m taking it slowly, hoping a route to victory will present itself.\n \"Oh dear,\" Lord Loss says, and my stomach sinks. He takes one of my pawns with a bishop, exposing my queen. I\u0027ll have to move her now, but that\u0027s going to leave my king vulnerable. Any half-hopes I entertain of winning on this board vanish.\n \"So sad,\" Lord Loss whispers, red eyes glowing dully. \"To lose nobly is horrible - but to carelessly throw the game away...\"\n \"Stuff it,\" I half-sob, knowing he\u0027s right, hating myself for surrendering so cheaply.\n \"You can concede defeat now, if you wish,\" he says. \"I have no heart, but if I had, there would be room in it for mercy. I will let you - \"\n \"I said stuff it!\" I roar, cutting him off. I brutally push my queen to safety, then turn my thoughts away from the board in the middle and focus on the three on which I still stand a slim chance of winning.\n Lord Loss doesn\u0027t finish me off on the centre board, but chooses instead to flirt with me on the others, toying with me, threatening my major pieces, letting me escape, then slowly moving back in for the kill.\n I\u0027m playing through tears, fingers shaking, breath rasping in my throat. It\u0027s not losing that I despise, but doing so in such a humiliating fashion. I ignored Lord Loss when he spoke of losing with dignity, but now I understand what he meant. To crumble at the moment of truth, to allow your opponent to psyche you out, to defeat yourself by playing dreadfully - that\u0027s a million times more sickening than coming, competing and being beaten fairly.\n \"I could chase you forever, Grubitsch,\" Lord Loss murmurs, once again sliding a queen backwards on the board to my left, when he could have pressed on with her and ensnared my king. \"Perhaps I will.\" He smiles with evil pleasure. \"Time can barely touch us here. I could make this game last an eternity.\"\n I respond by moving a pawn sideways on the far left board. A blind move, born of exhaustion and resignation.\n \"I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s an illegal move,\" Lord Loss says, putting the pawn back on its original spot. \"But I\u0027ll overlook it this time. Try again.\"\n \"Why don\u0027t you just finish it?\" I scream, picking the pawn up and throwing it straight at the demon\u0027s face. The pawn sticks in the flesh of Lord Loss\u0027s left cheek. He leaves it there a moment, while blood pools around it, then pries it free and places it back on the board.\n \"You should be grateful that I procrastinate,\" he chuckles, pressing a finger to the fresh cut on his cheek, then licking it clean of blood with his long grey tongue.\n \"This is your final ever game as one of the living. It\u0027s only fitting that it should last a lifetime.\"\n Hitting brick walls. Every time I advance, Lord Loss drives me back. Every time I go after one of his pieces, he smoothly evades capture. Every time I fall back and group my pieces around my kings - inviting him on, in the hope he\u0027ll get arrogant and make a mistake - he circles like a vulture, patient, cold, mocking.\n My temper rises and drops from minute to minute. I scream at him, turn my back and refuse to play, then give in and beg him to end the torment.\n Through it all he observes me with a slight, cutting smile, which spreads during my darkest moments, as he feeds on my sorrow with relish.\n Since my cause is hopeless, I spend more and more time watching Dervish battle the familiars. He seems to have the upper hand - the pair are wounded in many places - but Vein and Artery are still active, tracking him, probing for weak spots.\n \"A nasty nick,\" Lord Loss notes as Artery makes a pass and catches Dervish\u0027s left hip. Blood sprays into the air in slow motion, each drop vividly visible from where I sit. Dervish\u0027s lips press tightly together into a pained wince.\n \"I think your uncle might succumb before you do,\" Lord Loss says, reluctantly taking one of my pawns.\n \"As brave and resourceful as he is, he cannot continue forever.\"\n \"You\u0027d like that, wouldn\u0027t you?\" I snarl. \"To see him fail. To be able to pin the blame on him and make him feel guilty. I bet you\u0027d tell him I was enjoying great success on the boards - torment him before you let your slaves finish him off.\"\n Lord Loss beams ghoulishly. \"You see through me, young Grubitsch,\" he purrs.\n \"I\u0027m starting to,\" I mutter, and return to the game. I\u0027m reaching forward to move a knight when I pause, thinking about what I\u0027ve just said. I am starting to understand how Lord Loss operates. He isn\u0027t a difficult creature to make sense of - as Dervish told me already, the demon master feeds on pain. He thrives on the misery of others.\n \"Continue,\" Lord Loss encourages me, nodding at the knight. \"That\u0027s one of your finer moves. You\u0027ll threaten both my rook and queen. I\u0027ll have to do some quick thinking to wriggle out of this one!\" He laughs, as though my cunning delights him.\n But it\u0027s not my cunning he craves.\n It\u0027s my suffering.\n I withdraw my hand and jam it under the table, thinking furiously. My wits and chess skills are no match for Lord Loss\u0027s. I\u0027ve tried all I can to upset his game plan and disturb his style of play. But what if the answer doesn\u0027t lie in the game? What if I can compete with him on an emotional level and undermine him that way?\n Thinking -\n He\u0027s a parasite.\n He feeds off the misery of others.\n He takes delight in my failings.\n Observing -\n His smile, how it grows as my mood dips.\n The glow in his eyes when I run out of ideas and break down in tears.\n The eagerness with which he attacks, then withdraws.\n Wondering -\n What would happen if I robbed him of his grisly satisfaction?\n How would he respond if I cut off his supply of desperate grief?\n I close my eyes. Forget the boards, the game, Lord Loss. Think about Dervish and the speed with which he pushed me into this encounter. He could have prepared me for this in advance, told me about Bill-E and Lord Loss, worked with me on my weapons and chess skills, just in case he ever had to use me. But he didn\u0027t. He dropped me in it. No training or commands, except one simple, core piece of advice - don\u0027t act - react.\n Understanding clicks in. My eyes snap open. I\u0027ve been going about this the wrong way! Thinking, plotting, planning - those are all the things Dervish told me not to do. He warned me to obey my instincts, let the magic flow, react to the lunges and parries of the demons. He was talking about hand-to-hand combat, but why shouldn\u0027t those guidelines apply at the chess board too?\n I recall the way he launched into the game. No hesitation. No long study of the boards. I assumed it was because he had his game plan set clear in his mind before he sat down - but perhaps he didn\u0027t have one at all!\n \"Grubitsch?\" Lord Loss asks, fake concern in his expression. \"Are you well, my young friend? Can you continue?\"\n I stare at him wordlessly for a long, pregnant moment.\n Then I laugh.\n \"Of course I can!\" I boom, startling the demon master. \"Forgive me for the long delay - I was trying to remember if I left the light on in my bedroom before coming down.\"\n \"What?\" he blinks.\n \"Dad hated it when I left the lights on,\" I tell him, casually moving my queen on the middle board forward, presenting her to Lord Loss\u0027s rook. \"Electricity bills don\u0027t pay themselves, you know. Your move.\"\n Lord Loss stares at me, astonished, then down at the board. \"That was an unwise choice,\" he mutters. \"Born of haste, perhaps?\"\n \"No,\" I smirk. \"I knew what I was doing.\"\n \"You can retract the piece if you wish,\" he says.\n \"Really?\"\n \"It is not normally allowed,\" he smiles, \"but I will make an exception. Take your queen back. Recalculate. Choose a wiser course of action.\"\n \"Very kind of you.\" I pull the queen back six places to her original position, pause a moment - then move her forward into the exact same spot as before.\n Lord Loss\u0027s face darkens. I throw my head back and rock with laughter.\n \"You would be well advised not to try my patience,\" he hisses.\n \"To hell with your patience,\" I jeer. \"This game bores me. You bore me. Take my queen or drag things out - I don\u0027t care anymore.\"\n \"You wish to concede defeat?\" Lord Loss asks with undue eagerness.\n \"Nope,\" I chuckle. \"You\u0027ll have to come take me. And if you don\u0027t - if you play it coy, like you have been - I\u0027ll chase you. I\u0027ll give you no option but to rid me of my queens, rooks and bishops. And you know what I\u0027ll do then, old friend? I\u0027ll giggle! I\u0027ll guffaw! I\u0027ll positively explode with every last scrap of mirth I can muster!\"\n \"You\u0027ve lost your mind,\" he croaks.\n \"No,\" I smile spitefully. \"You\u0027ve lost your juicy meal ticket. I won\u0027t play the sad, bewildered victim any longer. You\u0027ll never feed from me again. You can kill me, but you won\u0027t squeeze one further drop of pleasure from me, not if you keep me alive for twenty lifetimes!\"\n The demon lord\u0027s jaw trembles. His eyes flare with pale red light. The snakes in his chest slide under and over each other in a sudden frenzy. Then he reaches out, pushes his rook forward with a stubby, ill-shaped excuse for a finger, and knocks my elfin queen from the table.\n In response, I look him straight in the eye - and laugh. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-18.html","bookId":2175,"book":{"id":2175,"title":"Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Lord Loss (The Demonata #1) \n Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies.
