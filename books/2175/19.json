{"id":99322,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Lord Loss surrounds my king on the middle board - checkmate. I giggle as my king melts. While it\u0027s still bubbling, I move a knight forward on the board to my right, then sit back and twiddle my thumbs, whistling tunelessly. \"This show of indifference does not become you,\" Lord Loss says stiffly, attacking my knight with a pawn. \"No show,\" I smile, switching play to the board on my far left, shoving a rook deep into enemy territory, barely thinking about it, not pausing afterwards to check my opponent\u0027s response. \"This is ridiculous, Grubitsch,\" Lord Loss says. He fakes an encouraging smile. \"If you throw the game away, you throw your life away too. You are already two games down. You cannot afford to lose again. You must concentrate. If not, you and your uncle - \" \"Chess is dumb,\" I interrupt. \"Like all games, it\u0027s silly and pointless. People who take it seriously are fools. I\u0027m sorry, but I can\u0027t pretend to respect your foolishness any longer, regardless of what\u0027s at stake.\" The demon master\u0027s lips peel back from his sharp grey teeth. \"I could reach across and crush you into a million pieces!\" he hisses. \"But that won\u0027t silence my laughter,\" I giggle. \"Have you moved?\" I lean forward to advance a pawn on the board to my left. \"Leave that alone!\" he shouts. \"I haven\u0027t had my turn yet!\" \"Well hurry up,\" I tut. \"I\u0027ve wasted enough time on this rubbish. Let\u0027s get it over and done with.\" Lord Loss trembles. Starts to say something. Catches himself. Mutters darkly and takes one of my pawns on the far left board. Before he\u0027s placed it on the desk, I push forward the pawn on the board to my near left, and once again fall back to studying my thumbs, twirling them mindlessly, thinking about summer, TV, music - anything except Lord Loss, his familiars and chess. Lord Loss isn\u0027t smiling any longer. His features are contorted with hatred. He takes long, agonised pauses before each move - not to drag the torment out, but because he\u0027s unsure of himself. I think about cracking jokes or singing songs, but I don\u0027t want to go overboard. Indifference is infuriating enough. He\u0027s unaccustomed to opponents showing no interest in the match or their fate. He\u0027s had long, delicious decades of pressure contests, feeding off the anxiety of those he faces, growing strong on it. He doesn\u0027t know how to cope with a vacant, yawning teenager. I don\u0027t play blindly, but I play recklessly, pushing forward on all three boards, taking wild chances, surrendering myself to the random mechanics of chess. I\u0027m presenting Lord Loss with more chances to finish me off than he could have ever dreamt of - but he fails to capitalise on them. He\u0027s too agitated to press for the kill. He fumblingly takes a few of my pieces but doesn\u0027t follow up on the captures. And then I start taking his pieces. I capture pawns first, a few on each board. I line them up in neat little rows, toying with them while he contemplates his moves. Then one of his knights falls prey to my queen on the board to my right. On the far left board I take a rook and bishop in quick succession. While he struggles to shore up his defences on that board, I push my queen ahead on the board next to it - straight into the path of a black bishop. Lord Loss gasps, his face lighting up. He sweeps the bishop forward, giggling intensely, eyes shining evilly. I snort at the demon master\u0027s pleasure and slip a knight in behind his bishop. \"Check.\" He freezes. Stares at the knight, then his king, then the captured queen in the mangled palm of his hand. His jaw quivers, then firms. \"A clever strategy,\" he commends me with icy politeness. \"Actually, I only saw the opening as you were removing my queen,\" I answer honestly. \"Lucky, I guess - though luck always plays a part in childish games like these.\" Lord Loss turns his face away in disgust. \"You are a disgrace to the game,\" he growls. \"So punish me,\" I goad him. \"Make me pay. Put me in my place.\" I adopt a very young child\u0027s challenging tone. \"Dare ya!\" He hisses. Fixes his gaze on the boards. Studies them feverishly. I pick at the nail of my left index finger and wonder if I should start using clippers instead of scissors. The balance of power lurches wildly between us. Lord Loss works hard to take three of my pawns. I respond by idly chasing his king with my knight on the board to my left, the one on which I lost my queen. He blocks my path, attacks my knight and does all he can to repulse me, but I hang in there, amused by his failure to capture my knight. After a while I start thinking how lonely he looks, a single white knight stranded amidst a sea of black, and to provide him with company, I press forward with a bishop and a rook. Lord Loss throws everything into smashing the three white irritants. He abandons attack completely and chases my knight, bishop and rook as though they were responsible for some personal insult. After several frenzied twists and cutbacks, he traps my bishop and chuckles fiercely. \"Next move - it\u0027s mine!\" \"I reckon you\u0027re right,\" I sigh, then grin impishly and push a pawn forward. I\u0027m not quite sure how it got there, but it\u0027s now only one space away from the end of the board, where I can exchange it for any piece I like. \"But on the move after that, my pawn becomes a queen - much preferable to a bishop, don\u0027t you think?\" Lord Loss stares at the pawn, then the knight, then back at the pawn. Two of his spare arms unfold around him. He covers his eyes. And moans. \"Checkmate.\" I mutter the word emotionlessly and scratch my left elbow. \"Can I make your king melt?\" I ask curiously. Lord Loss doesn\u0027t respond. His eyes are fixed on the trapped king on the board to my left, as though he can spot a way out if he looks at it long enough. \"I asked if I could make your - \" The black king explodes into tiny shards. I duck to avoid the flying bits of crystal. When I look again, Lord Loss\u0027s face is peppered with shiny splinters. Blood trickles from the cuts. \"You should take more pride in your appearance,\" I tell him. \"You\u0027ll never attract girls with an ugly mug like that.\" \"I\u0027ll see you suffer for this,\" he says hoarsely, red eyes bulging. \"Win or lose, I\u0027ll find a way to pay you back for the insults you\u0027ve dealt me tonight.\" \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" I smile. \"It surely can\u0027t be an insult to show no interest in a game in which I have no interest.\" \"Later,\" Lord Loss hisses, head shaking violently. \"Later!\" He turns to the board on my right - the one with the Incan pieces - and broods over it in menacing silence, collecting his thoughts. He pushes me hard on the Incan board. Slow but steady advances. Cutting off my avenues of attack. Forcing me back. Pegging me to my own half. I take no notice of the mounting threat. When I can\u0027t move forward, I slide sideways, dancing out of the path of his soldiers, shrugging it off when he captures one of my rooks, laughing as my knights leap clear of the closing net. Lord Loss\u0027s breath thickens the closer he gets to victory. Bloody sweat seeps from his pores. He twitches on his chair. I ignore the danger I\u0027m in. Keep one eye on Dervish as I shift a pawn forward. He\u0027s locked in close-quarters combat with the familiars, holding Artery away from his throat at arm\u0027s length, while Vein chews on his left leg. It looks serious, but I observe with cool disinterest. Lord Loss grunts contentedly and takes my pawn. A path is opening up to my king. Another few moves and I\u0027ll have to sacrifice my queen. \"You\u0027re not laughing now,\" Lord Loss notes sadistically. \"Only because my laughter seems to disturb you,\" I smile sweetly, sending one of my knights to the right of the board, to cover my queen. Lord Loss brings up a rook, blocking my queen\u0027s path of retreat. I move my knight again, lodging it between my queen and his rook. Grinning wickedly, he swiftly takes my knight with a pawn. I wince - then wink. \"I can\u0027t believe you fell for that one,\" I chortle. Picking up my queen, I slide her diagonally far up the board, through the gap left by the pawn he moved when capturing my knight - and knock Lord Loss\u0027s black queen clean off the table. His breath stops. His mouth closes. His stomach rumbles. \"Checkmate in four moves,\" I note drily. \"Or is it three?\" In response, Lord Loss picks up his king and crushes it softly between his mangled fingers. \"Two-two,\" he croaks, and turns to the board on my far left - the final board - the decider. Lord Loss moves his pieces sluggishly. He plays with sad remoteness, face cast in dull misery, flinching every time I capture one of his pieces, handing the game to me without a real fight. I feel a bubble of joy rising in my chest - and swiftly move to burst it. If I show any emotion now, he might seize upon it and revive with a flourish. Although it\u0027s difficult, I remain detached, moving my pieces instinctively, automatically, not dwelling upon thoughts of victory. Gradually I rip his defences to shreds. I check his king and he beats a sad retreat. For a couple of moves he threatens my queen, but then I drag her out of the way and check him again, with a rook. For a second time his king is forced to flee. A short while later I trap him on the left side of the board. He\u0027s caught between my queen, two knights and a bishop. He starts to move his king. Pauses. Does a double-take. Sighs deeply and slowly tips the king over. \"Checkmate,\" he intones morosely. I blink - I hadn\u0027t seen it. \"Are you sure?\" I ask, frowning. In response he pushes himself away from the table and floats out of his chair, face impassive. Real time crashes over me. I\u0027m hit by a wave of hot air. Sounds - Bill-E\u0027s howls, the snapping of Vein and Artery\u0027s teeth, Dervish\u0027s grunts. I spin. My uncle\u0027s on the floor, furiously wrestling with the demons. Blood everywhere. His left leg cut to ribbons. His right hand chewed off. \"Stop them!\" I scream, darting to Dervish\u0027s aid. Artery hears me, turns and snarls. Spreads his hands wide - morsels of Dervish\u0027s flesh caught between his teeth. Rises to meet me. \"Peace, Artery,\" Lord Loss says, and the demon stops. \"Cease, Vein,\" he commands, and the crocodile-headed monster quits chewing on Dervish\u0027s arm and looks questioningly at her master. \"I have been beaten. We must respect the rules of the game.\" The demons chatter and gibber madly. The flames in Artery\u0027s eyes flare and he hisses at his lord, shaking his head negatively. Vein snaps her jaws open and shut, then turns again on Dervish. \"You will obey me,\" Lord Loss says softly, \"or I shall have your heads.\" The demons pause. Then Vein clamps her teeth around Dervish\u0027s arm. Dervish screams. A blinding red light fills the cellar. I shut my eyes and cover my face with my arms. When I dare look again, Vein\u0027s lying in scraps of bloody flesh around my uncle. Artery has backed up to one of the webs and is whimpering fearfully. Lord Loss floats over to Dervish and studies him blankly as he sits up and sets to work on his injuries, using magic to patch himself back together. \"I won,\" I remark, carefully approaching my preoccupied uncle, wary of Lord Loss - he might have killed the rebellious Vein, but I still don\u0027t trust him. \"So I see,\" Dervish says, not glancing up from his wounds. I\u0027m bitterly disappointed by his reaction. I expected cheers and tears, hugging and back-slapping - not this. \"You needn\u0027t sound so excited about it,\" I sniff. Dervish looks up at me. A thin smile crosses his lips, then vanishes. \"I\u0027m delighted, Grubbs,\" he sighs. \"Truly. But this isn\u0027t over for me. I have to fight Lord Loss now, and it\u0027s a fight I probably won\u0027t win. So while I\u0027m ecstatic for you and Billy, I\u0027m a little too worried about myself to celebrate.\" \"What are you talking about? We won. I beat him. We can... I stop, recalling the full rules of the challenge. Lord Loss is under oath to cure the person affected by lycanthropy if he loses at chess - but the one who beats him has to travel to the Demonata\u0027s universe and fight him there. \"But I beat him!\" I cry, stooping to catch Dervish\u0027s eye. \"I\u0027m the one who has to go with him and - \" \"No,\" Dervish interrupts. \"The player always goes, while the one who fought the familiars remains. But since we swapped roles, we can choose who goes and stays. Isn\u0027t that right?\" he asks Lord Loss. Lord Loss nods slightly. \"It is an ambiguous point, but I have had enough of the boy. I shall seek him out some other time. As I vowed, he will pay for his humiliation of me, but for now I wish only to wash my hands of him.\" \"But you\u0027re wounded!\" I protest. \"You\u0027re not fit to fight any more. Let me. I know how to beat him. I can do it. I\u0027ll - \" \"This isn\u0027t a debate,\" Dervish says gruffly. He grips both my hands in his and squeezes tightly. \"You performed brilliantly on the boards, Grubbs, but this is a different matter. He\u0027s far stronger in his own universe than he is here. Leave it to me, OK?\" Tears roll down my cheeks unchecked. \"I don\u0027t want to lose you,\" I sob. \"But you must,\" he smiles. \"At least for a while.\" He finishes healing himself and stands, groaning loudly. Turns to Lord Loss. \"The cure?\" Lord Loss sneers. \"I had not forgotten.\" He floats across the room to the cage. Bill-E backs away, snarling fitfully, but at a gesture from the demon master he flies across the cage and thrusts his arms through the bars. Lord Loss wraps two of his own arms around Bill-E\u0027s and slides the other six through the bars of the cage, encompassing the struggling werewolf. He exerts pressure, until Bill-E goes stiff, then presses his face forward, places his lips over Bill-E\u0027s and exhales heavily, as though giving the kiss of life. Bill-E\u0027s fingers fly out rigidly, then curl up into tight fists. His legs shake fitfully, then go slack. After ten or twelve seconds, Lord Loss breaks contact and releases Bill-E. He floats backwards, coughing and spitting. Bill-E teeters on his feet a moment, then crumples to the floor. I start towards my brother, concerned. Dervish stops me. \"Wait. He\u0027ll be OK. There are things I must tell you before we say goodbye.\" I face my uncle, who speaks quickly. \"You know where the forms, credit cards and contact numbers are. Use them. Act swiftly. Don\u0027t be ashamed to ask for help. And don\u0027t let the authorities take you away from here. They might interfere when they discover the condition I\u0027m in, seek to separate you from me. Don\u0027t let them.\" His face is grim. \"Lord Loss has threatened you - that\u0027s serious. He can\u0027t harm you in Carcery Vale - as long as you stay out of this cellar - but you\u0027re vulnerable elsewhere. In time you\u0027ll learn spells to protect yourself - friends of mine will help - but for now you mustn\u0027t leave the Vale.\" \"What can I do to stop them?\" I ask. \"Stand up to them. Sic my lawyers - your lawyers - on them. Be brave. Prove you\u0027re fit to live independently. Don\u0027t give them any excuse to take you away. Meera will help - if she recovers - but you\u0027ll have to do a lot of it yourself.\" Lord Loss has drifted to the edge of the cellar while we\u0027ve been talking. He\u0027s floating in front of a thick bank of webs, gesturing at them with all eight arms, muttering something inhuman. Artery has crept up beside his master and squats sullenly next to him. As I watch, the webs shimmer, then twist in a clockwise direction, winding and wrapping together. The centre of the web pulses outwards a couple of times, then stretches backwards at lightning speed, cutting a path through the layers of webs behind it, creating an impossibly long, rotating funnel from the cellar to some indefinite point beyond. \"Take care of Billy,\" Dervish says. \"He won\u0027t remember any of this. It\u0027s up to you how much you tell him. I won\u0027t advise you one way or the other on that point. If you start to change...\" He hesitates, then presses on. \"Meera and one of my other friends might challenge Lord Loss on your behalf. If you want to make a fight of it, ask Meera, and she can - \" \"No,\" I interrupt softly. \"I won\u0027t put anybody else through this. It wouldn\u0027t be fair. If the curse hits me, I\u0027ll abandon myself to it, or call in the Lambs. But I won\u0027t ask anyone to face Lord Loss for me.\" Dervish smiles wanly. \"You might lose some of those noble ideals when you get a bit older.\" His smile softens. \"But I hope not.\" \"It is time, Dervish Grady,\" Lord Loss says. The spiralling funnel he\u0027s created glows redly, the webs revolving rapidly. Artery leaps on to the web at the rim of the funnel. He\u0027s sucked into it instantly. Spins around several times, head over heels, then vanishes down the funnel\u0027s maw, never to be seen in these parts again - I hope. \"Must you go?\" I sob, clutching Dervish\u0027s hands. \"Yes,\" he answers simply. \"If I refused, he could bring his hordes of familiars through and destroy us all.\" \"How will I know... if you\u0027re... successful?\" I gulp. \"As long as I\u0027m fighting, I\u0027ll be an emotionless shell here,\" he says. \"If I lose, that won\u0027t change, and you\u0027ll never know - I\u0027ll simply die of old age. But if I win...\" He winks. \"Don\u0027t worry - you\u0027ll soon find out!\" Dervish faces Lord Loss and the funnel. Takes a deep breath. Holds it. Lets it out nervously. \"Remember, Grubbs,\" he mutters. \"Don\u0027t give up on me. No matter how much time passes - even if it\u0027s decades - there\u0027s always hope.\" \"I\u0027ll look after you,\" I promise, weeping uncontrollably. \"Your mum and dad would have been proud of you tonight,\" Dervish says. \"Gret too.\" With that, he turns his back on me and marches to the funnel. Lord Loss bows politely as he approaches, then unfolds all eight of his arms and strikes for Dervish\u0027s throat. Dervish ducks swiftly, avoiding the demon master\u0027s lunge. \"Uh-uh!\" he laughs. \"You won\u0027t make that quick a finish of me!\" Leaping over the demon, he grabs hold of a thick strand of web, spins around, hollering wildly, then disappears down the funnel, becoming a speck, then nothing. Lord Loss floats towards the opening. Glances back at me, eyes cold and hateful. \"In the past, I\u0027ve respected those who bested me,\" he snarls. \"But you belittled both the game and me. I will be keeping a close watch on you, Grubitsch Grady, and if you ever - \" \"My name\u0027s Grubbs,\" I grunt, cutting him short. I step forward, wiping tears from my face. \"Now sod off back to your own world, you motherless scum, and save your threats for those who care.\" For a moment it looks like he\u0027s going to abandon protocol and rip me to shreds. But then he snarls, whirls away from me and hurls himself into the funnel of webs. There\u0027s a flash. The world turns red, then black. The webs fade. The funnel blinks out of existence. Walls and ceiling slowly return. It ends.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-19.html","bookId":2175,"book":{"id":2175,"title":"Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)","description":"Storyline: Lord Loss (The Demonata #1) Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies.
