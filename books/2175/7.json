{"id":99310,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Routines. Daily chores. Lots of chess competitions with Dervish and Bill-E. Dervish taught Bill-E how to play. He\u0027s much better than I am, though his concentration wanders occasionally, so I beat him more than I should. Watching TV. Hanging out with Bill-E. We play football and explore the countryside when we\u0027re not stuck in front of the massive screen or locking horns in chess tournaments.\n I\u0027m recognised in Carcery Vale now. Bill-E introduced me to the shopkeepers and gossips. They accept me the same as any other kid. Pass the time of day with me when I come in to pick up shopping. Ask about Dervish and what I think of the mansion. Tell me tales from its gory past, trying to spook me.\n Bill-E also takes me to visit Gran and Grandad Spleen. A couple of battleaxes! Narrow-eyed, sharp-tongued, drably dressed, their house in a state of perpetual gloominess. Grandad Spleen rambles on about the old days and how Carcery Vale has gone to the dogs. Grandma Spleen hovers in the background, serving tea and biscuits, eyes daring me to spill crumbs on her carpet.\n Both have lots to say about Dervish, none of it good.\n Not right, living out there on his own.\n A house like that\u0027s too big for one man.\n He should be married - but no one will have him!\n If he does anything out of order, you let us know.\n Bill-E smiles apologetically when we leave. \"I love my grandparents, but I know what they\u0027re like. I won\u0027t take you there too often.\"\n I shrug as if it\u0027s no big deal, but offer up silent thanks. I don\u0027t know how he sticks them. I\u0027d have run away from home years ago if I was caged in with a crabby old pair like that! Although, thinking twice about it, I suppose it\u0027s better to have grumpy grandparents as parents than no parents at all. I complained a lot about Mum and Dad when they were... still with me. They had their faults. I think everybody does. But I wouldn\u0027t complain if they were with me... alive now.\n The murders are never far from my thoughts. The memories of Vein, Artery and Lord Loss haunt me. Many nights I wake screaming, arms thrashing, eyes wild, imagining demons in the room with me, under the bed, in the wardrobe, scratching at the door.\n Dervish is always there when I wake from my nightmares. Sitting by the bottom of my bed. Passing me a mug of hot chocolate or a towel to wipe the sweat from my face. He never says much, or asks what I was dreaming about. Leaves as soon as I\u0027ve settled down.\n We haven\u0027t discussed the demons. I think Dervish wants to, but I\u0027m reluctant to step back into that world of darkness. He leaves books in my room, or open on the tables downstairs, about monsters, demons, magic. I avoid them at first. Later I read certain passages and study pictures, attracted to the mystery of this other realm despite my fear of it.\n No pictures of my demons in the books. I glance through some of the many encyclopaedias in the mansion, but there\u0027s no mention of a Lord Loss or his familiars in any of them.\n Friday. Listening to CDs I bought in the Vale. A roaring outside, of a motorbike approaching. But it isn\u0027t Dervish - he\u0027s up in his study. I creep to the window and secretly watch the cyclist dismounting. A woman dressed in black leather. Long blonde hair tumbles down over her shoulders when she removes her helmet. She stretches, hands going high above her head. Ay carumba! I\u0027m down the stairs in a flash, but not as fast as Dervish. He\u0027s already opening the front doors. I catch a glimpse of a big smile. Then he\u0027s shouting, \"Meera! I wasn\u0027t expecting you for another few days. Why didn\u0027t you phone?\"\n \"You never answer,\" the woman says, meeting Dervish in the doorway, hugging him hard. She pushes him away and studies his face. \"How\u0027s it going, hon?\"\n \"Not bad,\" Dervish chuckles.\n \"How\u0027s the lodger?\" She spots me over Dervish\u0027s shoulder. \"Oh, never mind, I\u0027ll ask him myself.\" She strides over and offers her hand. I shake it politely. \"Meera Flame,\" she introduces herself. She smiles - dazzling. \"And if I know Dervish, he hasn\u0027t told you a thing about me, right?\"\n I nod dumbly. I think I\u0027m in love!\n \"Grubbs Grady - Meera Flame,\" Dervish says. \"Meera\u0027s a close friend of mine. She comes to stay quite regularly. I meant to tell you she was on her way, but I forgot.\"\n \"He\u0027s useless, isn\u0027t he?\" Meera laughs.\n \"At some things,\" I mutter, finding my voice at last.\n Meera unzips the front of her leather jacket, revealing a T-shirt with an anti-war slogan. She slides out of the coat, then sits on the stairs and peels off her boots and trousers. She\u0027s wearing shorts underneath.\n \"Make yourself at home,\" Dervish says wryly.\n \"Don\u0027t I always?\" Meera replies. She catches me ogling her, and winks. \"Got a girlfriend, Grubbs? If not, watch out! I like younger men!\"\n I blush like a fire engine. Meera slips through to the kitchen for a drink.\n Dervish laughs. \"You look like a kettle.\"\n I frown. \"What do you mean?\"\n \"There\u0027s steam coming out your ears!\"\n Before I can think of a comeback, Meera calls from the kitchen. \"Whoops! I\u0027ve spilt milk all over my T-shirt. Can you come and help me out of it, Grubbsy?\"\n I think life\u0027s about to get very interesting!\n \"Ah,\" says Bill-E with a cheetah\u0027s smile. \"The mysterious Meera Flame. She\u0027s hot, isn\u0027t she?\"\n \"And doesn\u0027t she know it!\" I huff. \"She hasn\u0027t stopped flirting with me since she arrived. My cheeks feel like they\u0027ve been slapped a dozen times today!\"\n We\u0027re in the kitchen, guzzling milk shakes. Dervish and Meera have gone out for dinner. \"Don\u0027t worry about that,\" Bill-E says. \"She does it with me too. She likes making men - and boys! - blush.\"\n \"She\u0027s doing a good job of it,\" I mutter, then cough. \"Her and Dervish... are they...?\"\n \"Nah,\" Bill-E says. \"Just friends. She travels around a lot. Always off somewhere exotic. Comes to stay every now and then. They go on biking holidays together sometimes, but Dervish says they aren\u0027t an item, and I don\u0027t think he\u0027d lie. Who could keep quiet if they had a girlfriend like that!\"\n Saturday. Meera woke me up this morning for breakfast in bed. Walked right in, wearing a dressing gown and (as far as my imagination\u0027s concerned!) nothing underneath. Sat chatting with me while I ate, asking about life with Dervish and what I thought of Carcery Vale - \"Boring as hell, isn\u0027t it?\" - and just being all-round beautiful. I had a hard time keeping my eyes on my toast and fried eggs.\n Bill-E came early to see Meera. She fussed over him like a mother hen. \"You\u0027ve grown! You\u0027re filling out! Becoming a man! When are you going to sweep me off my feet and take me away from all this?\"\n Dervish and Meera made for his study after a while, so Bill-E and I headed out to explore the nearby forest. Searching for Lord Sheftree\u0027s buried treasure.\n \"If we find it, we don\u0027t tell anyone,\" Bill-E says, poking through the roots of an old dead oak. \"We wait until we\u0027re older and know more about these things. Then we sell it on the quiet and split the profits fifty-fifty. Agreed?\"\n \"Maybe I\u0027ll bump you off and take it all for myself,\" I smirk.\n \"Won\u0027t work,\" he says seriously. \"I keep a diary. If I die, Gran and Grandad Spleen will find it, read about us digging for the treasure, and put two and two together.\"\n \"You think of everything, don\u0027t you?\" I laugh.\n \"I try to,\" he says immodestly. \"I get it from Dervish and our chess games. He\u0027s always nagging me to maximise my potential and use my brain more.\"\n \"What is it with him and chess?\" I ask. \"My mum and dad were the same, like it was the most important thing in the world.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know about your mum,\" Bill-E says, \"but it\u0027s a family tradition on your dad\u0027s side. Seven or eight of the clan have been grandmasters. When Dervish talks about his ancestors, he often makes mention of the great chess players. He even judges people by their ability on the board. I asked him about one of his relatives once, a girl who died about thirty years ago - she looked interesting in her photo and I wanted to know what she was like. He just grunted and said she wasn\u0027t very good at chess. That\u0027s all he had to say about her.\"\n Bill-E decides the treasure isn\u0027t buried under the tree. Picking up our tools - an axe and a spade - we go in search of other likely spots.\n \"How often do you come searching for this treasure?\" I ask.\n \"It depends on the weather,\" he answers. \"In summer, when it\u0027s hot and the evenings are long, I maybe come out three or four times a month. Perhaps only once a month in winter.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you have any friends?\" I enquire bluntly - I\u0027ve noticed he doesn\u0027t talk much about other kids, unless he\u0027s chatting about school. And he always has plenty of time for visiting Dervish and me. He never says he can\u0027t come or has to dash off early to see another friend.\n \"Not many,\" he says honestly. \"I\u0027ve mates in class, but I don\u0027t see much of them outside of school. Gran and Grandad Spleen like to keep me tucked up safe and snug indoors, which is part of the problem. I like hanging out with Dervish, which is another part. I guess mostly I\u0027m just odd, not very good at making friends.\"\n \"You made friends with me pretty easily,\" I remind him.\n \"But you\u0027re like me,\" he says. \"An outsider. Different. A freak. We\u0027re both weird, which is why we get along.\"\n I\u0027m not sure I like the sound of that - I\u0027ve never thought of myself as a freak - but it\u0027d be childish to stamp my foot and shout something like, \"I\u0027m not weird!\" So I let it ride and follow Bill-E deeper into the woods.\n In the middle of a thicket. Picking a spot to clear, where we can excavate. I find a patch of soft earth between two stones. I start to dig and earth crumbles away. It looks like there\u0027s a hole here. Probably an animal\u0027s den, but maybe, just maybe...\n \"I think this might - \" I begin.\n \"Ssshh!\" I\u0027m cut short.\n Bill-E presses his fingers to his lips - silence. He crouches low. I follow suit. I can tell by his intent expression that this isn\u0027t a game. My heart beats faster. I grip my axe tightly. Flashback to that room, that night. Terror starts to dig its claws in deep.\n \"I smell him,\" Bill-E whispers. \"If he spots us, laugh and act as if we were trying to surprise him. If he doesn\u0027t, keep down until I tell you.\"\n \"Who is it?\" I hiss. Bill-E waves the question away and concentrates on the trees beyond the thicket.\n Ten seconds pass. Twenty. Thirty. I\u0027m counting inside my head, the way I do when I\u0027m swimming and trying to hold my breath underwater. Thinking - if it\u0027s them, should I run or try to fight?\n Sixty-nine, seventy, seventy-one... a pair of feet. Trainers. Lime green sports socks. I stifle a laugh. It\u0027s only Dervish! The terror passes and my heartbeat slows. I make a note to myself to give Bill-E a thumping later for scaring me like that.\n Bill-E stays low as Dervish pads past the thicket and moves on through the trees beyond. Then he wriggles out as quietly as possible and gets to his feet, gazing after the departed Dervish.\n \"What was that about?\" I ask, standing, wiping myself down.\n \"Let\u0027s follow him,\" Bill-E says.\n \"Why?\" I get a thought. \"You don\u0027t think he\u0027s going to meet Meera out here, do you?\" I grin slyly and nudge his ribs with an elbow.\n Bill-E glares. \"Don\u0027t be stupid!\" he snaps. \"Just trust me, OK?\" Before I can respond, he slips away in pursuit of Dervish, like an Indian tracker. I lag along a few paces behind, bemused, wondering what this silly game\u0027s in aid of and where it\u0027s leading.\n Several minutes later. Hot on Dervish\u0027s trail. Bill-E keeps his prey in sight, but is careful not to give himself away. He moves with surprising stealth. I feel like a clumsy bull behind him.\n Dervish stops and stoops. Bill-E catches his breath, reaches back and drags me up beside him. \"Can you see?\" he whispers.\n \"I can see his head and shoulders,\" I grunt in return, squinting. No sign of Meera, worse luck!\n \"Watch his hands when he rises.\"\n I do as Bill-E commands. Moments later my uncle stands, holding something stiff and red. I get a clearer view of it as he turns to the left - a dead fox, its body ripped apart.\n Dervish produces a plastic bag. Drops the fox into it. Studies the ground around him. Moves on.\n Bill-E waits a couple of minutes before advancing to the spot where Dervish found the fox. The ground is stained with blood and a few scraps of fur and guts.\n \"The blood hasn\u0027t thickened,\" Bill-E notes, poking a red pool with a twig, holding it up as though judging the quality of the blood. \"The fox must have been killed last night or early this morning.\"\n \"So what?\" I ask, bewildered. \"A dead fox - big deal!\"\n \"I\u0027ve seen Dervish collect others like that,\" Bill-E says quietly. \"There\u0027s an incinerator on the far side of the Vale. Dervish has a key to it. He takes the corpses there and burns them when nobody\u0027s about.\"\n \"The most hygienic disposal method,\" I note.\n \"Dervish doesn\u0027t believe in interfering with nature,\" Bill-E disagrees. \"He says corpses are an important part of the food chain, that we should leave dead creatures where we find them - unless they\u0027re likely to cause a public nuisance.\"\n \"What\u0027s all this about?\" I ask edgily.\n Bill-E doesn\u0027t answer. He stares at the forest floor, thinking, then turns sharply and beckons. \"Follow me,\" he snaps, breaking into a jog, and I\u0027ve no option other than to run after him.\n A clearing by a stream. Beautiful afternoon sun. I lie down and soak it up while Bill-E drags a large black plastic bag out from under a bush.\n \"I\u0027ve collected these over the last three months,\" he says, untying a knot in the bag\u0027s top. \"I saw Dervish removing a couple of bodies during the months before that, and thought I\u0027d keep an eye out for corpses and grab hold of them before he did.\"\n He finishes with the knot, clutches the bottom of the bag and spills the contents out. A swarm of flies rises in the air. The stench is disgusting.\n \"What the...!\" I cough, covering my mouth and nose with my hands, eyes watering.\n Lots of bones and scraps of flesh at Bill-E\u0027s feet. He separates them carefully with a large stick. \"A badger,\" he says, pointing to one of the rotting carcasses. \"A hedgehog. A swan. A - \"\n \"What the hell is this crap?\" I interrupt angrily. \"That stench is enough to knock - \"\n \"I didn\u0027t know why I felt I had to hold on to them,\" Bill-E says softly, eyes on the putrid corpses. He looks up at me. \"Now I know - to show them to you.\"\n I stare back uncertainly. This feels very wrong. If Bill-E was trying to gross me out, I could understand - even appreciate - the joke. But there\u0027s no laughter in his eyes. No grisly delight in his expression.\n \"Not you personally,\" he continues, looking back to the animals. \"But part of me must have wanted to show them to somebody. It was just a matter of time until the right person came along.\"\n \"Bill-E,\" I mutter, \"you\u0027re freaking me out big-time.\"\n \"Come closer,\" he says.\n I study his expression. Then the spade lying close to him on the ground. I take a firm grip on my axe. Walk a few steps towards him. Stop short of easy reach.\n \"Look at them,\" he says, pointing to the animals.\n Like the fox Dervish found, their bodies have been ripped open. Heads and limbs are missing or chewed to pieces. I flash back to images of Dad hanging from the ceiling.\n \"I\u0027m going to be sick,\" I moan, turning aside.\n \"These haven\u0027t been killed by animals,\" Bill-E says. I pause. \"Look at the way their stomachs have been ripped apart - jaggedly, but up the middle. And the bite marks don\u0027t correspond to any predators I know of. If this was the work of a wolf or bear, the marks would be wider spaced, and larger, because of the size of their jaws.\"\n \"There aren\u0027t any wolves or bears around here,\" I frown.\n \"I know. But I had to assume that it could have been a bear or wolf - or a wild dog - until I was able to examine the corpses in closer detail. I didn\u0027t leap to any conclusions.\"\n \"But you\u0027ve come to some since,\" I note wryly. \"So hit me with it. What do you think did this?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Bill-E says evenly. \"But I\u0027ve checked out the teeth marks in the best biology books and web sites that I could find. As near as I could match them, they seem to belong to an ape - \"\n \"You\u0027re not telling me it\u0027s King Kong!\" I whoop.\n \" - or a human,\" Bill-E finishes.\n Cold, eerie silence.\n Dervish\u0027s study. Bill-E leads me in. I\u0027m not sure where Dervish is, but his bike isn\u0027t outside, so he\u0027s not home. Meera\u0027s bike is gone too.\n \"We shouldn\u0027t be here,\" I whisper anxiously. \"Dervish said this room is magically protected.\"\n \"I know,\" Bill-E replies. He steps in front of me, spreads his arms and chants. I don\u0027t know what language he\u0027s using, but the words are long and lyrical. He turns as he chants, eyes closed, concentrating.\n Bill-E stops and opens his eyes. \"Safe,\" he grunts.\n \"You\u0027re sure?\"\n \"Dervish taught me that spell years ago. He updates it every so often, when he alters the protective spells of the house. It\u0027ll probably be one of the first spells he teaches you when he decides you\u0027re ready to learn.\"\n I feel uncomfortable, especially since I promised Dervish that I wouldn\u0027t come in here without him. But there\u0027s no stopping Bill-E, and I\u0027m too curious to back out now.\n \"What are we looking for?\" I ask, following him to one of the bookshelves. He came here directly from the clearing, without saying anything more about the dead animals he\u0027d collected.\n \"This,\" Bill-E says, lifting a large, untitled book down from one of the shelves over Dervish\u0027s PC. He lays it on the desk but doesn\u0027t open it.\n \"Demons killed your parents and sister,\" he murmurs. My insides freeze. He looks up. \"We inhabit a world of magic. My proposal would make an ordinary person laugh scornfully. But we\u0027re not ordinary. We\u0027re Gradys, descendants of the magician Bartholomew Garadex. Remember that.\"\n He opens the book. Creamy, crinkled pages. Handwriting. I try reading a few paragraphs but the letters are indecipherable - squiggles and swirls.\n \"Is that Latin, Greek, one of those old languages?\" I ask.\n \"It\u0027s English,\" Bill-E says.\n \"Coded?\"\n He half-smiles. \"Kind of. Dervish cast a reading spell on it. The words are written clearly, but we can\u0027t interpret them without unravelling the spell.\"\n Bill-E turns to the first page and runs a finger over the title at the top. \"Lycanthropy through the ages,\" he intones.\n \"How do you know that if you can\u0027t break the spell?\" I challenge him.\n \"Dervish read it out to me once.\" He looks at me archly. \"Do you know what \u0027lycanthropy\u0027 means?\"\n \"Of course!\" I huff. \"I\u0027ve seen werewolf movies!\"\n Bill-E nods. \"Dervish read bits of it to me. They were all to do with werewolf legends and rules. He\u0027s fascinated by werewolves - lots of his books focus on shape-changers.\"\n Bill-E flicks to near the end of the book, scans the pages, flicks over a few more. Finds what he\u0027s searching for and lays a finger on a photograph. \"I discovered this a year or so ago,\" he says softly. \"Didn\u0027t think anything of it then. But when I saw Dervish removing the bodies of the animals a few months ago, and found others ripped to pieces... always close to a full moon...\"\n \"I don\u0027t believe where you\u0027re going with this,\" I grumble.\n \"Remember the demons,\" he says, and turns the book around so that I can see the face in the photo.\n A young man, maybe sixteen or seventeen. Troubled-looking. Thin. His face is distorted - lots of hair, a blunt jaw, sharp teeth, yellow eyes. There\u0027s something familiar about the face, but it takes me a few seconds to place it. Then it clicks - it reminds me of one of the faces from the hall of portraits. One that hangs close to Dad and Gret\u0027s photos.\n \"Steven Groarke,\" Bill-E says. \"A cousin. Died seven or eight years ago.\"\n \"I met him once,\" I whisper. \"But I was very young. I don\u0027t remember much about him. Except he didn\u0027t have hair or teeth like that.\"\n Bill-E flicks the pages backwards. Comes to rest on a page with another photo from the hall of portraits, this time a young girl. \"Kim Reynolds. Ten years old when she died - supposedly in a fire.\"\n He flicks back further, almost to the start of the book. Stops at a rough hand-drawing of a naked, excessively hairy man, hunched over on all fours like a dog - or a wolf. Razor-sharp teeth. Claws. An elongated head. Yellow, savage eyes.\n \"That\u0027s not a human,\" I mumble, my mouth dry.\n \"I think it is - or was,\" Bill-E contradicts me. \"I can\u0027t be sure, but I\u0027ve compared it to a drawing of Abraham Garadex one of old Bartholomew\u0027s sons - and I\u0027d swear they\u0027re one and the same.\"\n I reach out with trembling fingers and gently close the book. \"Say it,\" I croak. \"Say what you brought me here to tell me.\"\n \"I\u0027m not saying this to shock you,\" Bill-E begins. \"I wouldn\u0027t say it to anyone else. But you were honest enough to tell me about the demons, so I think - \"\n \"Just say it!\" I snap.\n \"OK.\" Bill-E takes a deep, relaxing breath. \"I think those people in the book were shape-changers. I think lycanthropy runs in our family, and has done for hundreds, maybe thousands, of years. I think your uncle - my father - has it.\n \"I think Dervish is a werewolf.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-7.html","bookId":2175,"book":{"id":2175,"title":"Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Lord Loss (The Demonata #1) \n Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies.
