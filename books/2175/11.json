{"id":99314,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Slipping away from the house. Creeping around the sheds. Entering the forest. Moving cautiously, Bill-E leading the way. A bright night. Very few clouds to block out the worryingly full moon. But dark under cover of the trees. Countless spots where a creature could lie in ambush.\\n\\n \"Which way did he go?\" I whisper as Bill-E pauses and stoops.\\n\\n \"That way,\" Bill-E replies a few seconds later, pointing left.\\n\\n \"How do you know?\"\\n\\n \"Footprints,\" he says, tapping the ground.\\n\\n \"Who made you Hia-bloody-watha?\" I scrunch up my eyes but can\u0027t see any prints. \"Are you sure?\" I ask, wondering if he\u0027s deliberately leading me astray.\\n\\n \"Positive,\" Bill-E says, then stands and stares at me, troubled. \"If he sticks to this course, he\u0027s heading for the Vale.\"\\n\\n I stare back silently. Then we both turn without a word and resume the chase - faster, with more urgency.\\n\\n Running. Ducking low-hanging branches. Leaping bushes. Bill-E comes to a sudden halt. I run into him. Stifle a cry.\\n\\n \"I see him,\" Bill-E says softly \"He\u0027s stopped.\"\\n\\n I peer ahead into the darkness - can\u0027t see anything. \"Where?\"\\n\\n \"Over there,\" Bill-E points, then crouches. I squat beside him. \"We\u0027re on the edge of the forest. Carcery Vale\u0027s only a minute\u0027s jog from here.\"\\n\\n \"You think he\u0027s going to attack someone in the village?\" I ask.\\n\\n Bill-E tilts his head uncertainly. \"I can\u0027t believe it. But I don\u0027t see any other reason why he would come here. Maybe - \"\\n\\n He spins away abruptly, covering his mouth with his hands. Lurches through the bushes. Twigs snap. Leaves rustle. He collapses to the floor and throws up over a pile of twigs.\\n\\n My gaze snaps from Bill-E to the trees ahead. Clutching the handle of my axe so tightly it hurts. Waiting for Dervish to hear the commotion and investigate.\\n\\n Half a minute passes. A minute. No movement ahead.\\n\\n Bill-E shuffles up beside me. Rests in the shadow of a thick bush. Breathing heavily. Chin specked with vomit. \"I can\u0027t go on,\" he groans. His voice cracks as he speaks. His whole body\u0027s trembling.\\n\\n \"How bad are you really?\" I ask, searching for him in the shadows, only able to make out the dark outline of his face.\\n\\n \"Lousy.\" He chuckles drily. \"I should have listened to you earlier - gone home to bed. I need a doctor.\"\\n\\n \"Your house isn\u0027t far from here,\" I note. \"I could take you there.\"\\n\\n \"What about Dervish?\"\\n\\n \"Is he still where you said he was?\" I ask.\\n\\n Bill-E parts the bush above him, half-kneels and stares dead ahead. Silence for a few seconds. Then - \"Still there.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take you home,\" I decide, \"then circle back.\"\\n\\n \"But you can\u0027t track him like I can,\" Bill-E demurs. \"You need me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get by,\" I override him. \"The way you are now, you\u0027re a liability. It\u0027s only pure luck that he didn\u0027t hear you a few minutes ago. You\u0027re useless like this.\"\\n\\n \"Grubbs Grady,\" Bill-E giggles hoarsely. \"Tells it like it is.\"\\n\\n \"Come on,\" I mutter, offering him a hand up. \"The quicker we go, the sooner I can pick him up again.\"\\n\\n Bill-E hesitates, then grabs my sleeve and staggers to his feet. \"Sorry about this,\" he mumbles, bent over, hiding his face, ashamed.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" I smile, wrapping an arm around him. \"I couldn\u0027t have tracked him this far without you. Now - let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n Bill-E\u0027s house lies almost straight ahead, but Dervish is blocking the direct route. So we skirt around him and stumble further through the forest, until we find a spot downhill where he hopefully won\u0027t be able to see us.\\n\\n \"Walk or run?\" I ask.\\n\\n Bill-E doesn\u0027t answer immediately - his breath is ragged and he\u0027s trembling. Then he sighs and says, \"Walk. More noise... if we run.\"\\n\\n Holding Bill-E tight - I think he\u0027d collapse if I let go I start ahead, into the moonlit clearing.\\n\\n Stomach like a coiled spring as we leave the cover of the forest. I face forward, not wanting to trip over anything, but my eyes keep sneaking left, scouring the trees for signs of my uncle.\\n\\n \"Can you see him?\" I hiss out of the side of my mouth.\\n\\n Bill-E only groans in reply and doesn\u0027t look round.\\n\\n Getting close to the houses on the outskirts of Carcery Vale. Dark back yards. Lights in kitchen and bedroom windows. A woman cycles towards us, parallel to the forest. She waves. I start to wave back. Then she turns right and I realise she was only signalling.\\n\\n Coming up to the houses. There\u0027s a road behind them, where most of the residents park. We make the road and close in on the Spleen residence. I start to think about what Ma Spleen is going to say, and what will happen when she phones Dervish to complain about the condition he let her grandson walk home in. Perhaps I should take Bill-E directly to a doctor. It\u0027s late but I\u0027m sure -\\n\\n Bill-E gasps painfully and collapses. He dry retches and paws at the pavement, whining like a wounded animal.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I cry, dropping beside him. I reach to examine his face, but he brushes my hands away and snarls. \"Bill-E? What is it? Do you want me to - \"\\n\\n \"Grubbs - step away.\"\\n\\n A harsh voice, straight ahead of me. Slowly, trembling, I stand and stare.\\n\\n Dervish!\\n\\n My uncle\u0027s standing between us and the rear garden gate of Bill-E\u0027s home. No way past. He\u0027s illuminated by moonlight. A long hypodermic syringe in his right hand. Eyes ablaze with anger. \"Meera,\" he says, gaze flicking to a spot behind me. I glance back. A moment\u0027s pause, then Meera steps out from behind a van. My head spins. I remember an earlier mad thought - \"What if they\u0027re both werewolves?\"\\n\\n Dervish starts walking towards me.\\n\\n \"Stop!\" I moan, warning him off with my axe.\\n\\n \"Step away, Grubbs,\" he says again, not slowing. \"You don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening.\" Then, to Meera, \"Be careful. Block his escape, but don\u0027t get too close.\"\\n\\n \"I know what you are,\" I sob, tears of fear springing to my eyes. \"If you come any closer...\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t interfere,\" Dervish snaps. \"I don\u0027t want to hurt you, but if you don\u0027t step aside, I\u0027ll - \"\\n\\n He comes within range. I swing at him with my axe. Tears impair my aim - I swing high. Dervish curses and ducks. I take another blind swing. He shimmies closer as I\u0027m swinging, dodges the blade, chops at my axe arm with his free left hand.\\n\\n My arm goes numb from the elbow down. The axe drops to the ground. I dart after it. Dervish grabs the back of my collar and yanks me aside. I crash into a car. He\u0027s upon me before I have time to recover. Wraps his left arm around my throat. Exerts pressure.\\n\\n \"Dervish!\" Meera gasps.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s OK,\" he pants. Then, to me, as I struggle for my life, \"Easy! We\u0027re on the same side.\"\\n\\n \"Let go!\" I wheeze. \"I know what you are! Let - \"\\n\\n Low growling. Animalistic. Wolfen.\\n\\n But not from Dervish.\\n\\n From ahead of us.\\n\\n Dervish releases me. I stand rooted to the spot. Eyes wide. Staring at the beast as it rises to its feet and snarls. A contorted face. Yellow eyes. Sharp cheekbones. Dark shadows. Open mouth full of bared teeth.\\n\\n It raises a hand - dark skin, long nails, fingers curled into claws.\\n\\n And I realise, about a million years late, that a monster has breached the barriers of Carcery Vale tonight - but it\u0027s not Dervish.\\n\\n The werewolf\u0027s Bill-E Spleen! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-11.html","bookId":2175,"book":{"id":2175,"title":"Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)","description":"Storyline: Lord Loss (The Demonata #1) \\n Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies.
