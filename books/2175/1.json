{"id":99304,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Double history on a Wednesday afternoon - total nightmare! A few minutes ago, I would have said I couldn\u0027t imagine anything worse. But when there\u0027s a knock at the door, and it opens, and I spot my mum outside, I realise - life can always get worse.\n When a parent turns up at school, unexpected, it means one of two things. Either somebody close to you has been seriously injured or died, or you\u0027re in trouble.\n My immediate reaction - please don\u0027t let anybody be dead! I think of Dad, Gret, uncles, aunts, cousins. It could be any of them. Alive and kicking this morning. Now stiff and cold, tongue sticking out, a slab of dead meat just waiting to be buried. I remember Gran\u0027s funeral. The open coffin. Her shining flesh, having to kiss her forehead, the pain, the tears. Please don\u0027t let anyone be dead! Please! Please! Please! Ple -\n Then I see Mum\u0027s face, white with rage, and I know she\u0027s here to punish, not comfort.\n I groan, roll my eyes and mutter under my breath, \"Bring on the corpses!\"\n The head\u0027s office. Me, Mum and Mr. Donnellan. Mum\u0027s ranting and raving about cigarettes. I\u0027ve been seen smoking behind the bike shed (the oldest clich�� in the book!). She wants to know if the head\u0027s aware of this, of what the pupils in his school are getting up to.\n I feel a bit sorry for Mr. Donnellan. He has to sit there, looking like a schoolboy himself, shuffling his feet and saying he didn\u0027t know this was going on and he\u0027ll launch an investigation and put a quick end to it. Liar! Of course he knew. Every school has a smoking area. That\u0027s life. Teachers don\u0027t approve, but they turn a blind eye most of the time. Certain kids smoke - fact. Safer to have them smoking at school than sneaking off the grounds during breaks and at lunch.\n Mum knows that too. She must! She was young once, like she\u0027s always reminding me. Kids were no different in Mum\u0027s time. If she stopped for a minute and thought back, she\u0027d see what a bloody embarrassment she\u0027s being, I wouldn\u0027t mind her having a go at me at home, but you don\u0027t march into school and start laying down the law in the headmaster\u0027s office. She\u0027s out of order - big time.\n But it\u0027s not like I can tell her, is it? I can\u0027t pipe up with, \"Oi! Mother! You\u0027re disgracing us both, so shut yer trap!\"\n I smirk at the thought, and of course that\u0027s when Mum pauses for the briefest of moments and catches me. \"What are you grinning at?\" she roars, and then she\u0027s off again - I\u0027m smoking myself into an early grave, the school\u0027s responsible, what sort of a freak show is Mr. Donnellan running, la-di-la-di-la-di-bloody-la!\n BAWring!\n Her rant at school\u0027s nothing compared to the one I get at home. Screaming at the top of her lungs, blue bloody murder. She\u0027s going to send me off to boarding school - no, military school! See how I like that, having to get up at dawn each morning and do a hundred press-ups before breakfast. How does that sound?\n \"Is breakfast a fry-up or some cereally, yoghurty crap?\" is my response, and I know the second it\u0027s out of my mouth that it\u0027s the wrong thing to say. This isn\u0027t the time for the famed Grubbs Grady brand of cutting-edge humour.\n Cue the enraged Mum fireworks. Who do I think I am? Do I know how much they spend on me? What if I get kicked out of school? Then the clincher, the one mums all over the world love pulling out of the hat - \"Just wait till your father gets home!\"\n Dad\u0027s not as freaked out as Mum, but he\u0027s not happy. He tells me how disappointed he is. They\u0027ve warned me so many times about the dangers of smoking, how it destroys people\u0027s lungs and gives them cancer.\n \"Smoking\u0027s dumb,\" he says. We\u0027re in the kitchen (I haven\u0027t been out of it since Mum dragged me home from school early, except to go to the toilet). \"It\u0027s disgusting, antisocial and lethal. Why do it, Grubbs? I thought you had more sense.\"\n I shrug wordlessly. What\u0027s there to say? They\u0027re being unfair. Of course smoking\u0027s dumb. Of course it gives you cancer. Of course I shouldn\u0027t be doing it. But my friends smoke. It\u0027s cool. You get to hang out with cool people at lunch and talk about cool things. But only if you smoke. You can\u0027t be in if you\u0027re out. And they know that. Yet here they stand, acting all Gestapo, asking me to account for my actions.\n \"How long has he been smoking? That\u0027s what I want to know!\" Mum\u0027s started referring to me in the third person since Dad arrived. I\u0027m beneath direct mention.\n \"Yes,\" Dad says. \"How long, Grubbs?\"\n \"I dunno.\"\n \"Weeks? Months? Longer?\"\n \"A few months maybe. But only a couple a day.\"\n \"If he says a couple, he means at least five or six,\" Mum snorts.\n \"No, I don\u0027t!\" I shout. \"I mean a couple!\"\n \"Don\u0027t raise your voice to me!\" Mum roars back.\n \"Easy,\" Dad begins, but Mum goes on as if he isn\u0027t there.\n \"Do you think it\u0027s clever? Filling your lungs with rubbish, killing yourself? We didn\u0027t bring you up to watch you give yourself cancer! We don\u0027t need this, certainly not at this time, not when - \"\n \"Enough!\" Dad shouts, and we both jump. Dad almost never shouts. He usually gets very quiet when he\u0027s angry. Now his face is red and he\u0027s glaring - but at both of us, not just me.\n Mum coughs, as if she\u0027s embarrassed. She sits, brushes her hair back off her face and looks at me with wounded eyes. I hate when she pulls a face like this. It\u0027s impossible to look at her straight or argue.\n \"I want you to stop, Grubbs,\" Dad says, back in control now. \"We\u0027re not going to punish you - \" Mum starts to object, but Dad silences her with a curt wave of his hand \" - but I want your word that you\u0027ll stop. I know it won\u0027t be easy. I know your friends will give you a hard time. But this is important. Some things matter more than looking cool. Will you promise, Grubbs?\" He pauses. \"Of course, that\u0027s if you\u0027re able to quit...\n \"Of course I\u0027m able,\" I mutter. \"I\u0027m not addicted or anything.\"\n \"Then will you? For your sake - not ours?\"\n I shrug, trying to act like it\u0027s no big thing, like I was planning to stop anyway. \"Sure, if you\u0027re going to make that much of a fuss about it,\" I yawn.\n Dad smiles. Mum smiles. I smile.\n Then Gret walks in the back door and she\u0027s smiling too - but it\u0027s an evil, big-sister-superior smile. \"Have we sorted all our little problems out yet?\" she asks, voice high and fake-innocent.\n And I know instantly - Gret grassed me up to Mum! She found out I was smoking and she told. The cow!\n As she swishes past, beaming like an angel, I burn fiery holes in the back of her head with my eyes, and a single word echoes through my head like the sound of ungodly thunder... Revenge!\n I love rubbish dumps. You can find all sorts of disgusting stuff there. The perfect place to go browsing if you want to get even with your annoying traitor of a sister.\n I climb over mounds of garbage and root through black bags and soggy cardboard boxes. I\u0027m not sure exactly what I\u0027m going to use, or in what fashion, so I wait for inspiration to strike. Then, in a small plastic bag, I find six dead rats, necks broken, just starting to rot.\n Excellent!\n Look out, Gret - here I come!\n Eating breakfast at the kitchen table. Radio turned down low. Listening to the noises upstairs. Trying not to giggle. Waiting for the outburst.\n Gret\u0027s in her shower. She showers at least twice a day, before she goes to school and when she gets back. Sometimes she has one before going to bed too. I don\u0027t know why anybody would bother to keep themselves so clean. I reckon it\u0027s a form of madness.\n Because she\u0027s so obsessed with showering, Mum and Dad gave her the en suite bedroom. They figured I wouldn\u0027t mind. And I don\u0027t. In fact, it\u0027s perfect. I wouldn\u0027t have been able to pull my trick if Gret didn\u0027t have her own shower, with its very own towel rack.\n The shower goes off. Splatters, then drips, then silence. I tense with excitement. I know Gret\u0027s routines inside out. She always pulls her towel down off its rack after she\u0027s showered, not before. I can\u0027t hear her footsteps, but I imagine her taking the three or four steps to the towel rack. Reaching up. Pulling it down. Aaaaaaaaannnddd...\n On cue - screams galore. A shocked single scream to start. Then a volley of them, one running into another. I push my bowl of soggy cornflakes aside and prepare myself for the biggest laugh of the year.\n Mum and Dad are by the sink, discussing the day ahead. They go stiff when they hear the screams, then dash towards the stairs, which I can see from where I\u0027m sitting.\n Gret appears before they reach the stairs. Crashes out of her room, screaming, slapping bloody shreds from her arms, tearing them from her hair. She\u0027s covered in red. Towel clutched with one hand over her front - even terrified out of her wits, there\u0027s no way she\u0027s going to come down naked!\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Mum shouts. \"What\u0027s happening?\"\n \"Blood!\" Gret screams. \"I\u0027m covered in blood! I pulled the towel down! I...\"\n She stops. She\u0027s spotted me laughing. I\u0027m doubled over. It\u0027s the funniest thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\n Mum turns and looks at me. Dad does too. They\u0027re speechless.\n Gret picks a sticky pink chunk out of her hair, slowly this time, and studies it. \"What did you put on my towel?\" she asks quietly.\n \"Rat guts!\" I howl, pounding the table, crying with laughter. \"I got... rats at the rubbish dump... chopped them up... and...\" I almost get sick, I\u0027m laughing so much.\n Mum stares at me. Dad stares at me. Gret stares at me.\n Then -\n \"You lousy son of a - !\"\n I don\u0027t catch the rest of the insult - Gret flies down the stairs ahead of it. She drops her towel on the way. I don\u0027t have time to react to that before she\u0027s on me, slapping and scratching at my face.\n \"What\u0027s wrong, Gretelda?\" I giggle, fending her off, calling her by the name she hates. She normally calls me Grubitsch in response, but she\u0027s too mad to think of it now.\n \"Scum!\" she shrieks. Then she lunges at me sharply, grabs my jaw, jerks my mouth open and tries her hardest to stuff a handful of rat guts down my throat.\n I stop laughing instantly - a mouthful of rotten rat guts wasn\u0027t part of the grand ��ber-joke! \"Get off!\" I roar, lashing out wildly. Mum and Dad suddenly recover and shout at exactly the same time.\n \"Stop that!\"\n \"Don\u0027t hit your sister!\"\n \"She\u0027s a lunatic!\" I gasp, pushing myself away from the steaming Gret, falling off my chair.\n \"He\u0027s an animal!\" Gret sobs, picking more chunks of guts from her hair, wiping rat blood from her face. I realise she\u0027s crying - serious waterworks - and her face is as red as her long, straight hair. Not red from the blood - red from anger, shame and... fear?\n Mum picks up the dropped towel, takes it to Gret, wraps it around her. Dad\u0027s just behind them, face as dark as death. Gret picks more strands and loops of rat guts from her hair, then howls with anguish.\n \"They\u0027re all over me!\" she yells, then throws some of the guts at me. \"You bloody little monster!\"\n \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s bloody!\" I cackle. Gret dives for my throat.\n \"No more!\" Dad doesn\u0027t raise his voice but his tone stops us dead.\n Mum\u0027s staring at me with open disgust. Dad\u0027s shooting daggers. I sense that I\u0027m the only one who sees the funny side of this.\n \"It was just a joke,\" I mutter defensively before the accusations fly.\n \"I hate you!\" Gret hisses, then bursts into fresh tears and flees dramatically.\n \"Cal,\" Mum says to Dad, freezing me with an ice-cold glare. \"Take Grubitsch in hand. I\u0027m going up to try and comfort Gretelda.\" Mum always calls us by our given names. She\u0027s the one who picked them, and is the only person in the world who doesn\u0027t see how shudderingly awful they are.\n Mum heads upstairs. Dad sighs, walks to the counter, tears off several sheets of kitchen paper and mops up some of the guts and streaks of blood from the floor. After a couple of silent minutes of this, as I lie uncertainly by my upturned chair, he turns his steely gaze on me. Lots of sharp lines around his mouth and eyes - the sign that he\u0027s really angry, even angrier than he was about me smoking.\n \"You shouldn\u0027t have done that,\" he says.\n \"It was funny,\" I mutter.\n \"No,\" he barks. \"It wasn\u0027t.\"\n \"She deserved it!\" I cry. \"She\u0027s done worse to me! She told Mum about me smoking - I know it was her! And remember the time she melted my lead soldiers? And cut up my comics? And - \"\n \"There are some things you should never do,\" Dad interrupts softly. \"This was wrong. You invaded your sister\u0027s privacy, humiliated her, terrified her senseless. And the timing! You...\" He pauses and ends with a fairly weak \"...upset her greatly.\" He checks his watch. \"Get ready for school. We\u0027ll discuss your punishment later.\"\n I trudge upstairs miserably, unable to see what all the aggro is about. It was a great joke. I laughed for hours when I thought of it. And all that hard work - chopping the rats up, mixing in some water to keep them fresh and make them gooey, getting up early, sneaking into her bathroom while she was asleep, carefully putting the guts in place - wasted!\n I pass Gret\u0027s bedroom and hear her crying pitifully. Mum\u0027s whispering softly to her. My stomach gets hard, the way it does when I know I\u0027ve done something bad. I ignore it. \"I don\u0027t care what they say,\" I grumble, kicking open the door to my room and tearing off my pyjamas. \"It was a brilliant joke!\"\n Purgatory. Confined to my room after school for a month. A whole bloody MONTH! No TV, no computer, no comics, no books - except schoolbooks. Dad leaves my chess set in the room too - no fear my chess-mad parents would take that away from me! Chess is almost a religion in this house. Gret and I were reared on it. While other toddlers were being taught how to put jigsaws together, we were busy learning the ridiculous rules of chess.\n I can come downstairs for meals, and bathroom visits are allowed, but otherwise I\u0027m a prisoner. I can\u0027t even go out at the weekends.\n In solitude, I call Gret every name under the moon the first night. Mum and Dad bear the brunt of my curses the next. After that I\u0027m too miserable to blame anyone, so I sulk in moody silence and play chess against myself to pass the time.\n They don\u0027t talk to me at meals. The three of them act like I\u0027m not there. Gret doesn\u0027t even glance at me spitefully and sneer, the way she usually does when I\u0027m getting the doghouse treatment.\n But what have I done that\u0027s so bad? OK, it was a crude joke and I knew I\u0027d get into trouble - but their reactions are waaaaaaay over the top. If I\u0027d done something to embarrass Gret in public, fair enough, I\u0027d take what was coming. But this was a private joke, just between us. They shouldn\u0027t be making such a song and dance about it.\n Dad\u0027s words echo back to me - \"And the timing!\" I think about them a lot. And Mum\u0027s, when she was having a go at me about smoking, just before Dad cut her short - \"We don\u0027t need this, certainly not at this time, not when - \"\n What did they mean? What were they talking about? What does the timing have to do with anything?\n Something stinks here - and it\u0027s not just rat guts.\n I spend a lot of time writing. Diary entries, stories, poems. I try drawing a comic - \u0027Grubbs Grady, Superhero!\u0027 - but I\u0027m no good at art. I get great marks in my other subjects - way better than goat-faced Gret ever gets, as I often remind her - but I\u0027ve all the artistic talent of a duck.\n I play lots of games of chess. Mum and Dad are chess fanatics. There\u0027s a board in every room and they play several games most nights, against each other or friends from their chess clubs. They make Gret and me play too. My earliest memory is of sucking on a white rook while Dad explained how a knight moves.\n I can beat just about anyone my age - I\u0027ve won regional competitions - but I\u0027m not in the same class as Mum, Dad or Gret. Gret\u0027s won at national level and can wipe the floor with me nine times out of ten. I\u0027ve only ever beaten Mum twice in my life. Dad - never.\n It\u0027s been the biggest argument starter all my life. Mum and Dad don\u0027t put pressure on me to do well in school or at other games, but they press me all the time at chess. They make me read chess books and watch videotaped tournaments. We have long debates over meals and in Dad\u0027s study about legendary games and grandmasters, and how I can improve. They send me to tutors and keep entering me in competitions. I\u0027ve argued with them about it - I\u0027d rather spend my time watching and playing football - but they\u0027ve always stood firm.\n White rook takes black pawn, threatens black queen. Black queen moves to safety. I chase her with my bishop. Black queen moves again - still in danger. This is childish stuff - I could have cut off the threat five moves back, when it became apparent - but I don\u0027t care. In a petty way, this is me striking back. \"You take my TV and computer away? Stick me up here on my own? OK - I\u0027m gonna learn to play the worst game of chess in the world. See how you like that, Corporal Dad and Commandant Mum!\"\n Not exactly Luke Skywalker striking back against the evil Empire by blowing up a Death Star, I know, but hey, we\u0027ve all gotta start somewhere!\n Studying my hair in the mirror. Stiff, tight, ginger. Dad used to be ginger when he was younger, before the grey set in. Says he was fifteen or sixteen when he noticed the change. So, if I follow in his footsteps, I\u0027ve only got a handful or so years of unbroken ginger to look forward to.\n I like the idea of a few grey hairs, not a whole head of them like Dad, just a few. And spread out - I don\u0027t want a skunk patch! I\u0027m big for my age - taller than most of my friends - and burly. I don\u0027t look old, but if I had a few grey hairs, I might be able to pass for an adult in poor light - bluff my way into 18-rated movies!\n The door opens. Gret - smiling shyly. I\u0027m nineteen days into my sentence. Full of hate for Gretelda Grotesque. She\u0027s the last person I want to see.\n \"Get out!\"\n \"I came to make up,\" she says.\n \"Too late,\" I snarl nastily. \"I\u0027ve only got eleven days to go. I\u0027d rather see them out than kiss your...\" I stop. She\u0027s holding out a plastic bag. Something white inside. \"What\u0027s that?\" I ask suspiciously.\n \"A present to make up for getting you grounded,\" she says, and lays it on my bed. She glances out of the window. The curtains are open. A three-quarters moon lights up the sill. There are some chess pieces on it, from when I was playing earlier. Gret shivers, then turns away.\n \"Mum and Dad said you can come out - the punishment\u0027s over. They\u0027ve ended it early.\"\n She leaves.\n Bewildered, I tear open the plastic. Inside - a Tottenham Hotspur shirt, shorts and socks. I\u0027m stunned. The Super Spurs are my team, my football champions. Mum used to buy me their latest kit at the start of every season, until I hit puberty and sprouted.\n She won\u0027t buy me any new kits until I stop growing - I out-grew the last one in just a month.\n This must have cost Gret a fortune - it\u0027s the brand new kit, not last season\u0027s. This is the first time she\u0027s ever given me a present, except at Christmas and birthdays. And Mum and Dad have never cut short a grounding before - they\u0027re very strict about making us stick to any punishment they set.\n What the hell is going on?\n Three days after my early release. To say things are strange is the understatement of the decade. The atmosphere\u0027s just like it was when Gran died. Mum and Dad wander around like robots, not saying much. Gret mopes in her room or in the kitchen, stuffing herself with sweets and playing chess nonstop. She\u0027s like an addict. It\u0027s bizarre.\n I want to ask them about it, but how? \"Mum, Dad - have aliens taken over your bodies? Is somebody dead and you\u0027re too afraid to tell me? Have you all converted to Miseryism?\"\n Seriously, jokes aside, I\u0027m frightened. They\u0027re sharing a secret, something bad, and keeping me out of it. Why? Is it to do with me? Do they know something that I don\u0027t? Like maybe... maybe...\n (Go on - have the guts! Say it!)\n Like maybe I\u0027m going to die?\n Stupid? An overreaction? Reading too much into it? Perhaps. But they cut short my punishment. Gret gave me a present. They look like they\u0027re about to burst into tears at any given minute.\n Grubbs Grady - on his way out? A deadly disease I caught on holiday? A brain defect I\u0027ve had since birth? The big, bad cancer bug?\n What other explanation is there?\n \"Regale me with your thoughts on ballet.\"\n I\u0027m watching football highlights. Alone in the TV room with Dad. I cock my ear at the weird, out-of-nowhere question and shrug. \"Rubbish,\" I snort.\n \"You don\u0027t think it\u0027s an incredibly beautiful art form? You\u0027ve never wished to experience it first-hand? You don\u0027t want to glide across Swan Lake or get sweet with a Nutcracker?\"\n I choke on a laugh. \"Is this a wind-up?\"\n Dad smiles. \"Just wanted to check. I got a great offer on tickets to a performance tomorrow. I bought three - anticipating your less than enthusiastic reaction - but I could probably get an extra one if you want to tag along.\"\n \"No way!\"\n \"Your loss.\" Dad clears his throat. \"The ballet\u0027s out of town and finishes quite late. It will be easier for us to stay in a hotel overnight.\"\n \"Does that mean I\u0027ll have the house to myself?\" I ask excitedly.\n \"No such luck,\" he chuckles. \"I think you\u0027re old enough to guard the fort, but Sharon...\" Mum \"...has a different view, and she\u0027s the boss. You\u0027ll have to stay with Aunt Kate.\"\n \"Not no-date Kate,\" I groan. Aunt Kate\u0027s only a couple of years older than Mum, but lives like a ninety-year-old. Has a black-and-white TV but only turns it on for the news. Listens to radio the rest of the time. \"Couldn\u0027t I kill myself instead?\" I quip.\n \"Don\u0027t make jokes like that!\" Dad snaps with unexpected venom. I stare at him, hurt, and he forces a thin smile. \"Sorry. Hard day at the office. I\u0027ll arrange it with Kate, then.\"\n He stumbles as he exits - as if he\u0027s nervous. For a minute there it was like normal, me and Dad messing about, and I forgot all my recent worries. Now they come flooding back. If I\u0027m not for the chop, why was he so upset at my throwaway gag?\n Curious and afraid, I slink to the door and eavesdrop as he phones Aunt Kate and clears my stay with her. Nothing suspicious in their conversation. He doesn\u0027t talk about me as if these are my final days. Even hangs up with a cheery \"Toodle-pip\", a corny phrase he often uses on the phone. I\u0027m about to withdraw and catch up with the football action when I hear Gret speaking softly from the stairs.\n \"He didn\u0027t want to come?\"\n \"No,\" Dad whispers back.\n \"It\u0027s all set?\"\n \"Yes. He\u0027ll stay with Kate. It\u0027ll just be the three of us.\"\n \"Couldn\u0027t we wait until next month?\"\n \"Best to do it now - it\u0027s too dangerous to put off.\"\n \"I\u0027m scared, Dad.\"\n \"I know, love. So am I.\"\n Silence.\n Mum drops me off at Aunt Kate\u0027s. They exchange some small talk on the doorstep, but Mum\u0027s in a rush and cuts the chat short. Says she has to hurry or they\u0027ll be late for the ballet. Aunt Kate buys that, but I\u0027ve cracked their cover story. I don\u0027t know what Mum and co are up to tonight, but they\u0027re not going to watch a load of poseurs in tights jumping around like puppets.\n \"Be good for your aunt,\" Mum says, tweaking the hairs of my fringe.\n \"Enjoy the ballet,\" I reply, smiling hollowly.\n Mum hugs me, then kisses me. I can\u0027t remember the last time she kissed me. There\u0027s something desperate about it.\n \"I love you, Grubitsch!\" she croaks, almost sobbing.\n If I hadn\u0027t already known something was very, very wrong, the dread in her voice would have tipped me off.\n Prepared for it, I\u0027m able to grin and flip back at her, Humphrey Bogart style, \"Love you too, shweetheart.\"\n Mum drives away. I think she\u0027s crying.\n \"Make yourself comfy in the living room,\" Aunt Kate simpers. \"I\u0027ll fix a nice pot of tea for us. It\u0027s almost time for the news.\"\n I make an excuse after the news. Sore stomach - need to rest. Aunt Kate makes me gulp down two large spoons of cod-liver oil, then sends me up to bed.\n I wait five minutes, until I hear Frank Sinatra crooning - no-date Kate loves Ol\u0027 Blue Eyes and always manages to find him on the radio. When I hear her singing along to some corny ballad, I slip downstairs and out the front door.\n I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on, but now that I know I\u0027m not set to go toes-up, I\u0027m determined to see it through with them. I don\u0027t care what sort of a mess they\u0027re in. I won\u0027t let Mum, Dad and Gret freeze me out, no matter how bad it is. We\u0027re a family. We should face things together. That\u0027s what Mum and Dad always taught me.\n Padding through the streets, covering the six kilometres home as quickly as I can. They could be anywhere, but I\u0027ll start with the house. If I don\u0027t find them there, I\u0027ll look for clues to where they might be.\n I think of Dad saying he\u0027s scared. Mum trembling as she kissed me. Gret\u0027s voice when she was on the stairs.\n My stomach tightens with fear. I ignore it, jog at a steady pace, and try spitting the taste of cod-liver oil out of my mouth.\n Home. I spot a chink of light in Mum and Dad\u0027s bedroom, where the curtains just fail to meet. It doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re in - Mum always leaves a light on to deter burglars. I slip around the back and peer through the garage window. The car\u0027s parked inside. So they\u0027re here. This is where it all kicks off. Whatever \u0027it\u0027 is.\n I creep up to the back door. Crouch, poke the dog flap open, listen for sounds. None. I was eight when our last dog died. Mum said she was never allowing another one inside the house - they always got killed on the roads and she was sick of burying them. Every few months, Dad says he must board over the dog flap or get a new door, but he never has. I think he\u0027s still secretly hoping she\u0027ll change her mind. Dad loves dogs.\n When I was a baby, I could crawl through the flap. Mum had to keep me tied to the kitchen table to stop me sneaking out of the house when she wasn\u0027t looking. Much too big for it now, so I fish under the pyramid-shaped stone to the left of the door and locate the spare key.\n The kitchen\u0027s cold. It shouldn\u0027t be - the sun\u0027s been shining all day and it\u0027s a nice warm night - but it\u0027s like standing in a refrigerator aisle in a supermarket.\n I creep to the hall door and stop, again listening for sounds. None.\n Leaving the kitchen, I check the TV room, Mum\u0027s fancily decorated living room - off-limits to Gret and me except on special occasions - and Dad\u0027s study. Empty. All as cold as the kitchen.\n Coming out of the study, I notice something strange and do a double-take. There\u0027s a chess board in one corner. Dad\u0027s prize chess set. The pieces are based on characters from the King Arthur legends. Hand-carved by some famous craftsman in the nineteenth century. Cost a fortune. Dad never told Mum the exact price - never dared.\n I walk to the board. Carved out of marble, ten centimetres thick. I played a game with Dad on its smooth surface just a few weeks ago. Now it\u0027s scarred by deep, ugly gouges. Almost like fingernail scratches - except no human could drag their nails through solid marble. And all the carefully crafted pieces are missing. The board\u0027s bare.\n Up the stairs. Sweating nervously. Fingers clenched tight. My breath comes out as mist before my eyes. Part of me wants to turn tail and run. I shouldn\u0027t be here. I don\u0027t need to be here. Nobody would know if I backed up and...\n I flash back to Gret\u0027s face after the rat guts prank. Her tears. Her pain. Her smile when she gave me the Tottenham kit. We fight all the time, but I love her deep down. And not that deep either.\n I\u0027m not going to leave her alone with Mum and Dad to face whatever trouble they\u0027re in. Like I told myself earlier - we\u0027re a family. Dad\u0027s always said families should pull together and fight as a team. I want to be part of this - even though I don\u0027t know what \u0027this\u0027 is, even though Mum and Dad did all they could to keep me out of \u0027this\u0027, even though \u0027this\u0027 terrifies me senseless.\n The landing. Not as cold as downstairs. I try my bedroom, then Gret\u0027s. Empty. Very warm. The chess pieces on Gret\u0027s board are also missing. Mine haven\u0027t been taken, but they lie scattered on the floor and my board has been smashed to splinters.\n I edge closer to Mum and Dad\u0027s room. I\u0027ve known all along that this is where they must be. Delaying the moment of truth. Gret likes to call me a coward when she wants to hurt me. Big as I am, I\u0027ve always gone out of my way to avoid fights. I used to think (fear) she might be right. Each step I take towards my parents\u0027 bedroom proves to my surprise that she was wrong.\n The door feels red hot, as though a fire is burning behind it. I press an ear to the wood - if I hear the crackle of flames, I\u0027ll race straight to the phone and dial 999. But there\u0027s no crackle. No smoke. Just deep, heavy breathing... and a curious dripping sound.\n My hand\u0027s on the door knob. My fingers won\u0027t move. I keep my ear pressed to the wood, waiting... praying. A tear trickles from my left eye. It dries on my cheek from the heat.\n Inside the room, somebody giggles - low, throaty, sadistic. Not Mum, Dad or Gret. There\u0027s a ripping sound, followed by snaps and crunches.\n My hand turns.\n The door opens.\n Hell is revealed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-1.html","bookId":2175,"book":{"id":2175,"title":"Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Lord Loss (The Demonata #1) \n Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies.
