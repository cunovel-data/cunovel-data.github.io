{"id":99318,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"You\u0027re loco!\" I scream. \"Sheer bloody nuts!\" \"I\u0027m many things,\" Dervish answers calmly, \"but I don\u0027t think I\u0027m crazy.\" \"You must be! Only a crazy man would ask a kid to fight a couple of demons!\" Dervish studies me quietly, then gets to his feet and picks up his Lord of the Rings chess set. He heads for the door. \"Where are you going?\" I snap, lurching in front of him, blocking the way. \"I\u0027m taking this down to the cellar,\" he says. \"I need to have five sets in place before I summon Lord Loss - each game is played on a separate board.\" \"Didn\u0027t you hear me?\" I hiss. \"I won\u0027t do it! I\u0027m not - \" \"Grubbs,\" he silences me with a smile. \"It\u0027s OK. I asked. You refused. That\u0027s the end of it. It was a request, not a command.\" I glare at him suspiciously. \"It was?\" He nods. \"There are others who can help. One of my friends is a near grandmaster. He\u0027ll face Lord Loss. I\u0027ll handle Vein and Artery.\" He nods at a plain chess board to my left. \"But I\u0027d be obliged if you\u0027d help me carry the sets down.\" My eyes narrow. \"If you\u0027re trying to trick me...\" \"No tricks,\" he says, and I believe him. Getting out of his way, I pick up the board and follow him out of the room. Down the stairs to the main hall. Taking our time, careful not to drop any pieces. Thinking hard about what Dervish said. \"If you\u0027ve got friends who can help,\" I mutter, \"why ask me?\" \"Billy\u0027s your brother,\" Dervish replies. \"I thought you might want to be part of this.\" \"But it doesn\u0027t make sense,\" I press. \"You need the best person for the job. Why offer it to me?\" \"Ideally I want to face Lord Loss with someone who\u0027s proved their courage and ability under fire,\" he says. \"Someone who\u0027s faced a demon and lived. I only personally know six people who\u0027ve done that. Meera was one of them. But she can\u0027t do it now.\" \"What about the others?\" \"Four of them are currently out of contact.\" He reaches the door to the cellar and stops talking while he opens it with his elbows. Silence as we descend. I wait until we\u0027re at the wine rack which hides the entrance to the secret passageway before asking, \"And the sixth?\" \"You\u0027re the sixth,\" he says, stepping forward into darkness. The secret cellar. Five chess sets lie in place on the three tables, which we\u0027ve shoved together, piling the books and other odds and ends on the floor. Dervish is lining up the pieces, making sure they\u0027re in the right places. Bill-E\u0027s still chewing on the deer carcass. He spits and snarls at us every so often. Dervish hasn\u0027t said anything since our trip down with the first two boards. We\u0027ve worked silently, carting in the boards and pieces, clearing the tables and rearranging them. It\u0027s only now, while I watch him adjust the pieces, that I work up the courage to broach the subject again. \"I still don\u0027t understand why you want me to help. Why not wait for Meera to recover? You don\u0027t have to stage the contest tonight, do you?\" \"No,\" Dervish says. \"But waiting\u0027s dangerous. Lord Loss can reverse the change, even in one who\u0027s been a werewolf for several years. But often the mind can\u0027t be restored. Every day we wait drives Bill-E closer to the point from which it\u0027s not worth bringing him back. \"Besides,\" he adds, \"how would we explain his absence to his grandparents, teachers, the police? We\u0027re in the middle of an unreal adventure, but we\u0027re still part of the real world. Try telling a cop you\u0027ve got a boy locked up in a cage because he\u0027s a werewolf - see where it lands you!\" \"I didn\u0027t think of that.\" I manage a sick smile, which quickly fades. \"I\u0027m just a kid,\" I say quietly. \"I wouldn\u0027t be any good to you.\" Dervish wipes a spot of dust from the head of a king. \"You\u0027ve fought demons and lived to tell the tale. You\u0027ve tapped into your magic potential. You can fight them on their own terms - even if you are just a kid,\" he adds with a grin. \"I want to help,\" I groan. \"I\u0027d do almost anything to get Bill-E out of the hell he\u0027s in. But I saw Artery work Gret like a puppet, and - \" \"Don\u0027t beat yourself up over it,\" Dervish interrupts kindly. \"You\u0027re under no obligation. You came here to recover, not get dragged deeper into a nightmare. I shouldn\u0027t have asked. And I wouldn\u0027t have, except...\" He doesn\u0027t finish, so I say it for him. \"...except you need me.\" He shrugs. \"Like I said, there\u0027s a friend I can call. But I\u0027d rather have you. If I told you anything else, I\u0027d be a liar.\" Studying Bill-E as Dervish fetches weapons. His face and hands red with the deer\u0027s blood. Patting his stomach. Smiling jaggedly. Gazing at me through unnatural yellow eyes. Thinking about Lord Loss. Recalling the ferocious power and speed of Artery and Vein. Fearing for my uncle\u0027s and brother\u0027s lives. Dervish enters with a small axe, a mace and a sword. Lays them on the floor with the others he\u0027s already installed. Part of the rules - he can use as many weapons as he pleases. \"Would you want me to play chess or fight?\" I ask, wishing I could keep my mouth shut. \"I\u0027ve seen you play,\" Dervish says. \"No offence, but you\u0027d have to fight - Lord Loss would crush you on the chess boards.\" \"But you\u0027d stand a better chance against Vein and Artery than me,\" I counter. \"You\u0027re stronger and experienced. I know nothing about weapons or magic.\" \"You don\u0027t have to,\" Dervish says. \"The magic knows you. That\u0027s what matters. You tapped into your potential when you faced the demons before. You\u0027d tap into it again. Instinct.\" \"But you\u0027re the logical choice,\" I insist. \"You\u0027d be better than me.\" Dervish nods sombrely. \"Probably.\" \"And your friend\u0027s better at chess than me. So you fighting and him playing is the ideal partnership. Right?\" Dervish looks at me curiously. \"You don\u0027t have to talk yourself out of this,\" he says. \"You\u0027ve said you don\u0027t want to do it and I\u0027ve accepted your decision.\" \"But I feel lousy!\" I cry. \"Like I\u0027m letting you down!\" \"You\u0027re not,\" Dervish says. \"Ability and potential mean nothing if the will to compete isn\u0027t there.\" \"But even if I had the will, you\u0027d still be better off with the other guy, wouldn\u0027t you?\" I press, hoping he\u0027ll agree. Dervish shakes his head and doesn\u0027t answer. The room where Meera lies unconscious. Dervish tries again to wake her. Again he fails. He returns to his study, rubbing the back of his neck. Sitting behind his desk, he runs his fingers over a phone book. \"Time to call my friend,\" he says, glancing up at me. \"Final chance to change your mind, Grubbs.\" I don\u0027t say a word. Dervish opens the book and searches for a number. \"Pablo should be here within a few hours. You can go stay in the Vale if you want, but you don\u0027t need to. You\u0027ll be safe here. The demons won\u0027t be able to leave the cellar.\" I don\u0027t reply. Thinking of the battle to come. Filled with shame. \"If Pablo and I defeat Lord Loss and his familiars, but I lose the one-on-one fight later,\" Dervish continues, \"you\u0027ll have to take care of me.\" \"What?\" I mumble. \"My body will survive if I lose the battle after the chess match,\" he explains, \"but my soul and mind won\u0027t. I\u0027ll be able to move about, but I won\u0027t be capable of thought or speech. I won\u0027t be able to shop, pay bills, cook, clean the house, etc. You\u0027ll have to babysit me, or hire somebody to do it.\" Dervish taps a drawer in his desk. \"The necessary forms and information sheets are here. Names and numbers of lawyers and bankers, details of various credit accounts. You have my permission - written as well as verbal - to manage my estate as you see fit, though a large portion will remain in the hands of your legal guardians until you come of age.\" \"I don\u0027t want your money,\" I sniff. \"You won\u0027t feel that way always,\" he smiles. Picks up the phone. Hesitates. Lays it down. \"One last thing. If things pan out bad, I\u0027ll appear no better than a mindless robot. You might feel sorry for me, be tempted to put me out of my misery.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t do that!\" I shout. \"I\u0027m not a killer! I couldn\u0027t - \" \"You could,\" Dervish cuts me short. \"Most people are capable of extreme actions when pushed.\" He licks his lips nervously. \"You mustn\u0027t. Time is different in the Demonata\u0027s universe. There\u0027s no telling how long our fight could last. The few who\u0027ve fought him and returned have been absent for months... years... on one occasion, decades. \"No matter how much time passes, there\u0027s always hope,\" he says. \"Don\u0027t give up on me, Grubbs. Look after my body. I might have need of it again some day.\" He finds the number in the book, picks up the phone and starts dialing. \"Wait,\" I stop him. He looks up expectantly. I lick my lips nervously. \"What happens if you don\u0027t win and I turn into a werewolf later?\" Dervish\u0027s features soften. \"And the wolf shall lie down with the lamb.\" \"Come again?\" I frown. \"It\u0027s a biblical quote. Isaiah. It\u0027s where the Lambs got their name from.\" He jerks his head at the desk. \"There\u0027s a black folder in the second drawer down on the left. Names and numbers for the Lambs. Contact them if the need arises. But only do it if you\u0027re sure that you\u0027re changing. The Lambs don\u0027t mess around. Once you set them in motion, they won\u0027t stop, even if you change your mind and try to call them off.\" \"How will I know?\" I ask. \"Bill-E didn\u0027t know he was changing.\" Dervish chews on his lower lip in thoughtful silence, then says, \"Nobody turns without warning. If the lycanthropy strikes, there\u0027ll be at least two or three full moons during which you won\u0027t physically alter, but run wild like Bill-E did. You won\u0027t be able to recall such episodes, but if you find blood under your fingernails, animal hairs between your teeth...\" Dervish stiffens and speaks roughly \"...that\u0027s when you need to think about calling in the Lambs.\" As I stare at him miserably, Dervish returns his attention to the phone and hits the buttons. The phone at the other end is picked up almost instantly. I hear a man say, \"Yes?\" Dervish starts to reply. \"Tell him it\u0027s OK,\" I interrupt softly. \"Tell him you rang his number by accident.\" \"Grubbs, you don\u0027t have to - \" \"I won\u0027t live with the threat of the change hanging over me. Or with the guilt of not fighting for Bill-E.\" Deep breath. Thinking - crazy for doing this. But also - it\u0027s what Dad would have wanted. \"I\u0027ll do it,\" I wheeze. \"I\u0027ll fight Vein and Artery.\" The thinnest, most fleeting of smiles. Mock bravado. Grubbs Grady - demon killer! \"I\u0027m your man.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-loss-the-demonata-1/page-15.html","bookId":2175,"book":{"id":2175,"title":"Lord Loss (The Demonata #1)","description":"Storyline: Lord Loss (The Demonata #1) Grubbs Grady has stiff red hair and is a little big for his age, which means he can get into R-rated movies.
