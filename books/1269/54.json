Besides, I hear you cry at night sometimes, too.” Now the sparks race up to the dark! Like little fiery nightbirds—“You do? maybe I should explain . . .”—up and up and up and then gone, like little nightbirds— “But the things is, at just the time this ol’ boy wanted us to come hunt down his fox, this bluetick bitch of Hank’s she was right in the middle of heat an’ havin’ to be kept in the barn so’s every mutt in the country wouldn’t be after her. Hank, he still wanted to bring her along, sayin’ that as soon’s the hunt got goin’ none the other dogs would pay any attention to her condition. But Ben, he says, ‘Dammit, boy, don’t try to tell your Uncle Ben about what a animal will frigging pay attention to and what he won’t: those dogs would leave a whole treeful of foxes to mount that bitch of yours ...I mean I know about these sorta things. . . .’ an’ Hank, he says that we didn’t have to worry about his dog gettin’ mounted, that she could outrun anything on four legs he didn’t care what kind of attention it were payin’ her . . .” —Henry is a nighthawk from behind, perched against the flames. “Shh, Lee.” “Don’t worry about him, Viv—” Doesn’t he care if Henry hears? “—he can’t hear us; he’s too wrapped up in his story.” Or doesn’t he care to leave me alone so we can just watch the sparks, or listen to that faraway belling of that one lone dog (scrabbling up loose dirt, sliding, leaning to corner a stump, a log up! Molly soars over the deadfall in her path without breaking stride, forepaws folded back against her scratched and bleeding breastbone, ears spreading for the jump like nicked wings; at the peak of her jump, across weightless expanse of brush, she saw him for the first time since he had broken through the pack—a round wobbling black ball flecked with the glisten of moonlight, boring ahead through the wet fern: bay-OO-OO-OOHRR!—then stretched forth her paws to catch the jar of earth running again) that one baying dog so far away and so beautiful . . . doesn’t he care? “Viv, listen to me, please.” “Shh, I’m listening to Henry’s story.” “But Ben he says, ‘Henry, I don’t know as I’d let that boy bring that Jezebel along an’ that’s the truth—we’d be watchin’ a rape instead of a hunt.’ But Hank he says we just gotta let him bring her ’cause there won’t be another hunt or another fox like this for her to learn on in years!” —the hand presses, slight desperate pressure: “But I have to talk to you—to somebody ...please. And I might not have another chance.” But doesn’t he feel that pounding there? “No, Lee, don’t . . .” “Well, we fussed and fussed about it for a spell and anyhow what happened is Hank talked Ben into lettin’ him bring her along just for the trip, just so’s she could watch the hunt, not even run in it—an’ Ben says all right. ‘But listen here,’ Ben says, ‘you keep that whore up front in the cab with us on the trip over—sit her in your lap or something, just don’t put her in back with all the other hounds; they’d be so rundown with screwing her that by the time we got across the hills to the hunt they wouldn’t be able to see nothing but tail, or trail nothing but cunt! Assuming they had the strength left to run a trail at all. ...’ ” —she tries to stop her ears against the words at her cheek— “I must tell you something. Viv. About Hank, what I was planning to do. And why”—against the needle-sharp hook of pain she senses lurking beneath the words, tugging at her flesh; “It all started a long time ago . . .” But in spite of her efforts to stop the words she can feel some of the need getting through: he doesn’t need me that much, he couldn’t— “So Hank’s bitch rode up front all the way over, sitting in his lap. We got there an’ it was just comin’ daylight, I recall, sun was just comin’ up. An’ there was another fella there an’ he had him six or seven dogs. An’ when they saw how we’s all favorin’ Hank’s bluetick—I mean had her up in his arms by god—they wanted to know what kinda damned animal we had that had to be treated so special. Hank says, ‘The best goddamned animal of its kind in the state.’ This feller with the other dogs, he winks at me an’ says, ‘Why, we’ll just see about that!’ An’ goes into his pocket for his wallet and lays a ten-dollar bill on the car fender an’ says, ‘Right, here we go, sport. Ten to one. Ten dollars to your buck, my old brake-legged beat-up mongrel here finds that fox before your pedigree.’ An’ points over at his dog, about the finest-lookin’ walker I ever see in my life with three or four these Kennel Club badges from field trials on his collar. Hank starts to eat pie about then an’ say he can’t let his dog run because of a game leg or some such an’ this guy gives him the horse laugh an’ brings out another ten-dollar bill an’ plunks it down an’ says, ‘All right, twenty to one an’ I’ll hold my flea-farm back the count of fifty.’ Hank, he looks up there at me an’ I just shrug on account it’s Ben’s pick-up an’ Ben’s hunt, an’ Hank’s about to have him another slice of humble pie when Ben comes over an’ puts a buck on the fender an’ says, ‘You’re on, old buddy.’ An’ this fella like to dropped his teeth out. I mean a fifty-count lead! Lordymercy, that’s way out yonder for a dog even if she is in heat an’ inexperienced! So this ol’ boy has talked himself into a bind. He swallers a time or two but he ain’t about to eat some of his own cookin’, so he gives Ben a hard look an’ says all right . . .” —and as this need grows more intense so does a sensation of movement, speed to come, impending declaration—“The past is funny, Viv; it never seems to let things lie, finished. It never seems to stay in place as it should”—until she feels that she is beginning to run down an ever steepening hill and she must stop before the hill gets too steep and she gets going too fast to stop: Oh. Look! A bit of the moon; how pretty— “So we go on over through this fence to the other ol’ boy’s, the farmer’s, barn, an’ he says we can drive most the way up this gully if the fox runs that way, which he’s like to do. An’ he says we ought’n’ have no trouble picking up his trail ’cause he’s all around the henhouse every night. So Hank takes his dog on over to the fence and sics her onto the scent ’n’ off she goes sure enough at a real smart clip, too. This fellow, he goes over there to the fence with his dog and fires him up while Hank counts. Then off he goes! and a little bit after that we let all the rest of ’em loose just to be shut of ’em. So this fellow got in the pickup with us an’ we took out up this road and I swear we run them dogs for hours in this little bitty ole canyon not much bigger’n our own front porch. Over an’ around an’ back an’ forth. I told Ben, I says, ‘That by god is about the smartest fox I ever seen. How that bastard can keep ahead o’ them dogs this long without treein’—in a little bitty place like this—hell, I bet they wasn’t a rod o’ area—little bitty stream—an’ he just kept goin’!” —She lets her eyes unfocus. Look. That stick of spruce has feathers of flame, spanning. “And some things out of the past kept troubling the present, my present . . . so much so that I felt I had to eliminate the past, to destroy it. That’s one reason for my tears in the night.” But crying isn’t really so different from singing. Sure. Or from that dog’s baying. (Molly clawed spraddle-legged up the face of the rock toward the sucking black hole where the bear had gone. She fell, unable to grasp the lip of the cavern as the bear had. She bayed and leaped again, but this time skittered off sideways down between a boulder and the rock wall, into a narrow stone slot squirming with dark. She wrenched free, still baying, and ran to leap again. But felt a sudden, searing weight at her hip hauling her back, jerking her back from the rock like a red-hot leash driven into her hipbone) And crying doesn’t always mean need— “Well, just like we was scared he’d do, the fox finally made a dash for it. We was up to one end of the canyon when we heard the dogs turn an’ double back past us toward the farm. We swung the pick-up around an’ headed after ’em, Ben at the wheel just apourin’ it to her. We knew we had to keep purty good track after they passed the mouth of the canyon where the farm was, ’cause out past that was a lotta rivers an’ roads an’ stuff where they might run for days. So when we get to the farm at the mouth of the canyon we wheel up to the fence an’ that ol’ farmer that owns the place, he’s standin’ there lookin’ after that pack of animals where they’re foggin’ it up the road to beat thunder....” But, oh, I wish he would please leave me alone. . . . “And soon’s we stop ol’ Ben jumps out an’ hollers an’ asts the farmer, ‘Say! was that them come right past here jest now?’ And this old boy, this farmer says, ‘It shore was.’ And Ben jumps back into the pick-up, about to head on out after ’em, when just then Hank—it seems like he was in the back; must of been in the back, I guess, that other fellow we’d made the bet with was up in the cab with Ben an’ me—when Hank says wait and hollers, ‘Where was my dog runnin’? My bluetick?’ The farmer, he kinda grins and says, ‘The young bitch? Why, she was runnin’ out in front, naturally.’ An’ this gets a rise outa the other old boy—him and his fifty bucks he stands to lose—an’ he says, ‘Did you see what position my walker was runnin’?’ An’ the farmer nods an’ says, ‘Why yessir, I did. Your dog was runnin’ a good close third, just about neck-and-neck with the fox!’ With the fox! Yee haw haw . . .” The old man reared back and beat again at the fire with his stick. “Yee haw haw haw...neck-and-neck with the boogin’ fox, y’see? Ben’d been right: hounds, fox an’ all had all been so interested in a little nooky they’d the whole bunch of ’em been the livelong night runnin’ the tail offn that pore little bluetick! Yee haw! Ben teased Hank about it for months, sayin’ she’d probably whelp a litter of blueticks with big red fox bushtails! Oh me...oh haw haw haw!” The old man shook his head, then pushed himself standing with the cane. Still chortling at his anecdote, he walked to the edge of the firelight; when Lee heard him peeing into the dry vetch he went on with his furtive whispering. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1580/47016.html","bookId":1269,"book":{"id":1269,"title":"永不让步 Sometimes a Great Notion","description":"简介： 《有时冒出了一个伟大的念头》（Sometimes a Great Notion） 于1964 年出版，书名源自民歌有时冒出了一个伟大的念头/要跳入河中漂流 ，讲的是俄勒冈州某小镇两个独立谋生的伐木工人的故事，他们信奉的人生准则是永不屈服（`Never Give An Inch），虽然不如 《飞越布谷鸟...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/15/10-22-01-86-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1580","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
