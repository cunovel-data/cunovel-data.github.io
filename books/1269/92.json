{"id":12814,"no":92,"title":"Chapter 91","content":"“Hank! Lord, man, you can’t touch the—” Orland grabbed my wrist and brought me out of it. “It was all that music and that crap,” I told him. “Made me sleepy as a dog.” “Let’s move on outside,” Viv whispered. I followed her out. My time with the tarp was justified; it had clouded over solid. I saw a little patter of rain hurrying up the street. It had been scheduled for the funeral but made it late; now it was hustling to be sure it didn’t miss the burying. Men hunched their shoulders and women held the little flowery funeral programs over their hairdos and went to scurrying like chickens for shelter. It looked like it was going to open up all the time we were hustling to the jeep, but it never. It kept pittypatting during the funeral procession through the middle of town; just barely; holding back, like it was waiting....) 626 ken kesey Boney Stokes waits until the whole procession has passed. He wants to be sure the doctor is at the funeral grounds as well as Hank. It is a long walk from the Snag to the hospital for an old man—for a sick old man—and he doesn’t want to chance being turned away from his goal, after enduring the journey, by some young fool doctor with orders otherwise. A long walk. Through rain, too, he noticed as he buttoned his long black raincoat to his skinny neck, through rain and cold and me with these weak lungs.... Oh, what a man of Christian intent will not endure for an old friend! (At the graveside the rain got down to business and thinned the crowd down to only about a third what it was at the parlor. We bunched up close around the hole. They were burying Joby beside his old man, or beside all of his old man that had been brought back down from that shack where he’d disappeared to. Enough insult right there to make both of them plow the ground with turning. It was almost funny. If this judgment day Joe was always looking forward to ever comes round, I thought, and those two come up for air and find they been buried next to each other, then the fur is really gonna fly. Joe always wanted to be as far from his old man as possible, even got his face rearranged so he wouldn’t look like Ben Stamper; he couldn’t think of anything worse than growing up with what he called that handsome and hopeless face. I thought again about the way Lilienthal had fixed Joe’s dead face—powdered over the scars, ironed out the grin—and I wanted to open that box and fix them for him. I wanted to so bad it made me clench up my fists till I could feel myself shake; it made me strain all over. Not to hold myself back from doing it, but because I knew I wasn’t going to do it. I just stood there. I watched them straddle the grave rails, and lower the coffin, all the while clenching my fists and straining and wishing they’d get that mud thrown on that coffin and get it out of sight. And just stood there. As soon as Joe was buried I took Viv’s arm and started off. When we got to the jeep I heard somebody holler, “Hank! Hank boy!” It was Floyd Evenwrite; he was yelling and waving out of the window of his big Pontiac to me. “You an’ your woman jump in sometimes a great notion here with us. We got room to waste. You don’t need to drive all that way back down to town in that leaky old jeep. Let Andy take it an’ jump in here in a decent machine....” Evenwrite gave me a big old toothy grin and waited. It was an open invitation to bury the hatchet, and everybody concerned damn well knew it. But I thought I saw what was almost a taunt behind that grin. Like he was grinning that, sure, just a week or so ago, Hank old boy, I was trying to sabotage your mill and stampede your whole summer’s work down the river. But let’s be buddies.... “What you say, boy ...?” I looked at Viv, and at Andy standing near the crowd around Big Lou’s car. They waited for me to decide; we all knew that Floyd and his bunch had a lot to do with putting that squeeze on us that helped to do in Joe. I tried to decide something, but all I could think was I’m tired, I’m tired of being the villain. . . . “Be right with you, Floyd,” I hollered back at him and grabbed Viv by the hand. “Okeydoke with you, Andy? Just leave it on Main someplace, the jeep.” We scampered over to the door he held open for us. Nobody said anything during most of the ride. When we got down near town Evenwrite asked why I didn’t drop by the Snag for a beer or so. I told him that I thought Viv was wanting to get on over to Joe’s new house to be with Jan, and he said fine, we’d drop her by, but then what? I told him that I ought to go by the hospital and see how the old man was making out, but after that I’d think about it. “Good. You do that. I’ll drop Viv off and we can turn up Necanicum and take you right past the hospital. Then you think about it. Okay?” I said okay. I tried to catch Viv’s eye a time or two to see how she felt about my decision, but she kept to herself. And after we dropped her off I asked myself why should I care anyhow? I was glad to be in a good dry car. I was glad to be getting invitations for rides and beers. I was glad to have somebody stick out a hand to me. We turned from South Main to Sillits Street toward Necanicum. I sank back in the deep cushion of the big car and listened to the wipers and the heater and Evenwrite make small talk with his family. I didn’t care how Viv or Andy looked at 628 ken kesey me. I didn’t care if there was a little taunt in Evenwrite’s grin. I didn’t’ even care what Joby would’ve thought about it. Because as far as I was concerned the fight was finished, the hatchet buried ...for good.) The minute Hank was out of the car, Evenwrite’s kids, kept in sedate behavior in the back seat for so long by the presence of two strange grown-ups and the solemnity of the occasion, begin to act up so that Floyd was forced to stop the car twice before he got home, to knock some ears down. He left his house in a fury, jumped back in the car, and screeched away from his yard toward the Snag, with his kids crying and his wife threatening and his bowels turning. When he reached Main he made two runs the length of the street, checking for Draeger’s car, before he stopped; he by god wasn’t about to go in there and have Draeger crow about the human heart to him! Not him! He was amazed that Hank could even consider dropping by, with “I told you so” on the tip of everybody’s tongue. Amazed and, he found, a little disappointed: he’d expected more of Hank. And he felt that Hank had betrayed him some way or other, though he couldn’t exactly say why....And why ain’t I satisfied how things worked out? Indian Jenny pulls on her boots and begins her trek to the Snag. Sometimes direct action worked better than magic. Especially some night, in a bar. Be a lot of drunks there tonight. And who knows? Simone opens the package just delivered by the young matchstick-chewer from Stokes’s General. “No card from who?” “No, no card or nothin’,” he had told her. “Howie said be sure no card or nothin’...so’s you couldn’t send it back to somebody.” “Well you just take it right back to somebody—so pretty, though, how could he?—and you tell somebody I accept no gifts from strange men....But how could he know to pick one so pretty and the right size, I bet?” “His sister was with him to help, maybe?” “Then you take it back to his sister.” “I can’t do that,” the boy said, moving to try to peek through the front of her housecoat. “I just deliver.” sometimes a great notion “Yes?” “Yeah.” He winked and shifted the matchstick to the opposite corner of his mouth and was gone before she could stop him. Simone hustled the gift into her bedroom before Mother Nielsen or her kids in the other half of the duplex heard and came snooping. She spread the frock on her bed and looked at....So pretty. But no. She had promised. She could not disappoint the Virgin . . . She had returned the dress to the box and started folding the tissue paper back over it when through her bedroom window she saw Indian Jenny passing, thick and dumpy and rubber-booted, in the dimming rain. Simone stared, lightly trailing her fingers along the rustling tissue. That—she grimaced at Jenny— is what I did not wish to become. That is the thing I did not wish to become. I made the confession, I swore on the Book, I promised the Sweet Mother of God to sin never again ...but that woman there is what I do not wish to become. She suddenly remembered her image in the mirror, and the pity in the eyes of the women who saw her on the street. Her eyes closed ...I have had virtue. But it is almost that I have become through virtue what that heathen slut out there became through sin, a tramp, a shuffler in dumpy dresses. It is so now that to the women of the town I look like the town whore. Because of my appearance. Because I can’t afford to look decent. Oh, oh, Sweet Mother! She pressed the tissue against her lips. Oh give me strength in my weakness . . . The sin that she now felt from looking sinful, Simone realized as she sobbed into the tissue, was more painful than the sin she had once felt from sinning. “What has happened, Holy Mother, that I become so sinful?” she beseeched the wooden statue in her closet. “What has happened that I become so weak?” But another thought was already growing like yeast in her mind: And you, Holy Mother, to let this happen...what has happened to you? Fluorescent tubes fluttered and hissed. The air felt purified. The Amazon of a nurse had said, “Right this way, Mr. Stamper,” as soon as Hank approached her desk, before he had even 630 ken kesey asked to see his father. She picked up a clipboard and led him out of the newer part of the hospital, down a corridor so low he found himself ducking involuntarily to avoid the overhead lights, through hallways so old he thought they might have been carved out of the bygone centuries by Indians and whitewashed in honor of the white man’s coming. A section of the clinic that he had not seen before—wooden walls fossilized by endless scrubbings, linoleum floors worn bare by endless shufflings of white canvas shoes...and through open doors glimpses of old people propped like cloth dolls against brass bedsteads, hairless faces limp and wrinkled in the stony blue flickering of TV. The nurse noticed his interest and paused, smiling into one of the larger rooms. “Each room’s got one now. Used, of course, but still in excellent shape. The DAR ladies donated them.” She adjusted a strap through the fabric of her uniform. “Gives the old folks something to look at, y’know, while they wait.” The picture in the room they were looking into had begun to flip; yet no one called for an adjustment. “While they wait for what?” Hank couldn’t help wondering out loud. The nurse gave him a sharp look and started on down the corridor again toward the old man’s room. “We had to situate him where we had room,” she felt compelled to explain, speaking sharply. “Even though he might not be classified geriatric. The new wing is always so crowded . . . babies and young mamas and the like. Besides, he’s not exactly a spring chicken any more, now is he?” The place stank of age, of all the accouterments of age, strong soap and wintergreen salve, alcohol and baby food, and, over everything, the keen reek of urine. Hank’s nose wrinkled with distaste. But, he reasoned, when you come down to it, why shouldn’t the old live in an old world and the bright new wing be reserved for babies and young mamas and the like? “No ...I guess he ain’t exactly a spring chicken any more.” The nurse stopped at the very last door. “We did give him a private room, you see. Mr. Stokes is in there with him now.” Her voice had dropped to a reedy whisper. “I know what you told us about nobody gettin’ in to see him for a while, but I figured . . . sometimes a great notion well, my lands, they’re such old friends I couldn’t see the harm.” She smiled quickly and opened the door, stepping in to announce, “Another visitor, Mr. Stamper.” The gaunt and white- maned head reared up out of the pillow with a bray of laughter. “By god now, I was beginning to think all my kin had give me up for dead. Find a chair, son. Sit. Wait. Here’s old Boney. He’s been here cheering me up, like a good soul.” “Afternoon, Hank. My condolences.” The cold hand touched Hank’s with a husking, parchment sound, then withdrew quickly to cover a practiced cough. Hank looked down at his father. “How you makin’ it, Papa?” “ ‘Middlin’, Hank, middlin’.” His brows lowered despondently over defeated eyes—“The doc says it’ll be a piece before I can get back to loggin’, maybe a long piece . . .”—then lifted quickly to reveal a flash of ornery green. “But he says I’ll be playin’ the violin again before the week’s out. Oh yee haw, hee hee haw! Look out for me, Boney, they been shootin’ me fulla dope an’ I’m a caution.” “Henry.” Boney spoke through his fingers, hiding the thin slot of mouth. “You had best take it easy now....” “Listen to him, son; don’t you know he brings me a lot of pleasure comin’ here? Here, sit down on the edge of the bed if you can’t run down a chair. Nursie, don’t I get but one chair? And what d’ya say you bring another scuttle of mud for my boy?” “Coffee is provided for the patients, Mr. Stamper, not for the visitors.” “I’ll pay for it, goddangit!” He winked at Hank. “I tell ya . . . when they fust brought me in here the other night you just would not believe all the crap and paraphernalia they wanted me to fill out. Seems as you neglected to, so I had to do it.” “That’s not true!” the nurse hoped in horror; but there was no telling about that night staff. “I don’t think it’s true.” “Yessir, fill all kinds of the stuff out. Even was after my fingerprints by god till they seen I weren’t equipped for it.” The woman turned and huffed away down the corridor. Henry studied her departure with an expert’s eye. “Hogs fightin’ under a 632 ken kesey sheet...how’d I like to sink my long yellows in that an’ let it drag me to my death?” “If you was of an age,” Boney added on, “to have long yellows.” He wasn’t giving a thing. “Maybe you’d have to sink your gums into her, Boney. But I still got three my own teeth, if you’ll notice”—he opened his mouth to display the proof—“an’ two of ’em meet.” This seemed to tire him momentarily and his high spirits waned while he lay for a few seconds with his eyes closed. When his head rolled on the pillow to look again at his somber visitor his good humor seemed strained. “You know, that damned woman, she’s been waiting all the livelong day for this ol’ nigger to give up the ghost an’ get it over with so’s she can make the bed. Now I believe she’s peeved that I haven’t.” “Maybe she’s just worried,” Boney observed solemnly. “She’s had a lot of reason to be worried about you, old fellow.” Henry rallied to meet the challenge. “Reason the bull. I weren’t even close, not even close, you goddam vulture. Listen at him, Hank, the old buzzard. Why I weren’t even in shoutin’ distance!” Hank smiled weakly. Boney looked down at the floor with a slight shaking of his head. “My, my, my.” It was his day, he felt, and he wasn’t about to let his toll of doom be drowned out by a few tinkles of humor. Henry didn’t like that shake of the head. “You think no? I always said, didn’t I, that I could outlog any man this side of the Cascades, with one arm tied behind my back? All right, now I get a chance to prove it. An’ you by god wait an’ see if I—” A sudden thought occured to him; he turned back to Hank. “Say, what come of that arm, anyhow? Because, y’know...” He timed a little pause before he announced, “I was kinda attached to it!” His head fell back to the brass bars, mouth going wide in voiceless laughter. Hank knew the old man had probably been waiting for hours for the opportunity to make that announcement. He told Henry that he’d kept good track of the limb. “I had a notion you might want to keep it. I got it in the freezer with all the other meat.” sometimes a great notion “Well, you watch that Viv don’t fry it up for supper,” Henry warned. “For I was always mighty attached to that arm.” When Henry tired of his joke he fumbled for the buzzer button that dangled on a wire beside his head. “Where in hell that woman go to now? I ain’t been able to get anything out of her all day, and I don’t just mean coffee. Hank, I want you to bring me up on—here! damn it, ring this gizmo for me; she keep puttin’ it on the wrong side where I can’t get at it. On my wingless side. Hm. You be careful of that ol’ wing, now. Damn. Where is that old cow? A man could die in this place and people wouldn’t know it till the stink got bad. Listen, I want to know what’s happenin’ with the show an’ if—Come on! don’t just fiddle with it, buzz hell out of it. That’s what it’s here for. Boney, what’s the matter’th you? Sittin’ there like you lost your best friend...?” “It’s only that I’m worried for you, Henry. Just exactly that.” “Balls. You’re worryin’ I’ll outlive you is just exactly what. You been worryin’ that ever since I can remember. Son, Jesus Christ ohmighty, give me that outfit!” Swinging it by the wire, he clanged the button loudly against the nightstand and called in a pained and angry voice, “Nurse! Nurse!” His eyes clenched with the effort. “Get me another shot o’ that dope, and where the hell’s that caw-fee!” “Easy, Papa . . .” “Yes, Henry . . .” Boney spread his web of fingers over the sheet covering Henry’s knee. “You better take it a little easier.” “Stokes”—Henry’s eyes, usually so wide that white could be seen all the way around pupils hot as Fourth of July flares, went narrow and cold—“git your fishy old mitt off ’n my leg. Just git it off.” He glared at Boney until the other’s eyes dropped; he felt a surge of delight at finally voicing a feeling long unvoiced. He continued to look straight at Boney and went on, speaking with unusual softness, “You’re just as bad as she is, Stokes; you know that. Except you been forty-five years at it. Hopin’ I’ll give up the ghost.” He drew back the button-on-wire threateningly. “Now git it off, I tell you. Off!” Boney withdrew his hand and held it at his chest, looking wronged. Henry dropped the button and began jerking about beneath the covers in a state of tense agitation. 634 ken kesey “That’s not true, old friend,” Boney said in a hurt voice. “ ’S true. ’S true as the day is long, an’ we both know it. Forty-five years, fifty years, sixty years. Nurse!” Boney sighed and half turned in his chair, presenting a face pained by the injustice of the accusation. But there was something so false in his attitude of wronged friendship, something so vicious in the denying shake of his head, that Hank was certain that the whole act was a deliberate admission to all of Henry’s charges. Fascinated, he moved back to the foot of the bed and stood there, half hidden by the yellowed bed curtain. The two old men had forgotten him in their confrontation of each other. Boney continued to shake his head sadly; Henry jerked about beneath the covers and glared sideways at the figure in the chair from time to time. After a minute of silence, he worked his mouth to express a feeling that had burned so long unworded that now it threatened to rage out of control. “A good sixty years. Ever since ...ever since ...goddam you, Stokes, I can’t even remember when it first started, it’s been there so long!” “Ah, Henry, Henry . . .” Boney chose to acknowledge the fire through his overdrawn denial of it. “Can you truthfully now recall me ever giving you anything but what I considered the soundest advice, the very soundest, in all our years? Can you?” “Like which? Like the time you advised me and Ben and Aaron to bring Ma to go to Eugene for the Welfare, because we couldn’t endure a season alone in those woods? Somebody that ain’t used to it, you says, can’t endure a season in these woods. You recall that advice? Well, we endured it fine, as I look back....” “You lost your mother that winter from your stubbornness,” Boney reminded him. “Lost her? She died! The woods didn’t have beans to do with it. She just got sick and laid down and died!” “It mightn’t of happened in town.” “It’d of happened anywhere. She died that year cause she made up her mind that she was bound and determined to die.” “We all offered to help.” “I’ll say you did. You helped us right out of that feed store.” sometimes a great notion “We all unselfishly offered the necessities of life—” “And wanted what in payment? Our house an’ property? A mortgage on the next ten years?” “Henry, that’s unfair; the organization made no such demands.” “Not wrote down any place, maybe, but they was demands made just the same. I never seen your old man—or that goddam organization neither one—get hurt from any of these unselfish offerings. You did all right with your offerings.” “Be that as it may, there’s no one who can accuse us of havin’ anything but the interests of the community at heart.” Before Henry could answer, the door opened and the nurse entered with a small paper cup of coffee. She set it on the bed-stand, looked around at the silent men, and hurried back out without saying anything. Henry took up the cup and drank. He watched Boney through the rising steam. When he brought the cup from his lips, Hank saw that the rim bore mark of those two teeth out of three that met. Henry placed the cup back on the nightstand, never taking his eyes from Boney’s bent head. With the sleeve of his white flannel robe he wiped his mouth. Boney continued to shake his head, clucking pityingly over his old companion’s unbalanced state. “Boney,” Henry finally said in a flat voice, “you got any snoose on you?” Boney’s face brightened. “Surely, surely.” He drew a can from the pocket of his coat. “Here, let me—” “You give it here.” He blinked at Henry, then placed the can carefully on the sheet, unopened. Henry picked it up. He began turning it around and around in his pink hand as the thumb laboriously pushed at the lid; a fraction of an inch, turn, another fraction, another turn ...Hank ached to take the can from his father, quickly screw the lid off, and end this thing, free both himself and his father from an obsession that seemed more and more senseless. But he somehow did not dare move from his hiding place beside the curtain. Not yet. Not until it was finished of its own accord. The lid popped off. The coarse brown fuzz of tobacco boiled 636 ken kesey out over the sheet. Henry cursed, then, patiently, with Boney watching motionless, scooped the bulk of the spill back into the tin, replaced the lid, popped it tight between thumb and finger, tossed it into Boney’s lap.... “Much obliged.” Then swept the remainder into a small heap on the sheet, rolled this into a ball, and placed the wad between his lower lip and his gums. He concentrated a second as he maneuvered the charge into comfortable position, then flapped the grains from the sheet with a victorious flourish. The stained lips broke into a broad grin. “Much obliged, old fellow, old friend...very much obliged.” Now it seemed it was Boney’s turn to fidget. Henry’s success with the snuff had shaken his complacency and placed the burden of the contest on his humped shoulders. “What do you plan on now, Henry,” he wanted to know, trying to sound matter-of-fact, “now that things have changed?” “Why, what do you mean, Boney? Just what I been doin’, I imagine.” The old daring confidence returned to Henry’s eyes. “Plan to get back out there with the boys, I imagine, back out in the woods. Lettin’ daylight in the swamp. Bullwhippin’ the brush.” He yawned and drew a long fingernail down the stubble of his neck. “Ah, I ain’t foolin’ myself. I ain’t a pup any more. When you get into your seventies you got to think about slowin’ up, lettin’ the boys do the muley work while you rely on your knowhow and experience. Maybe even get me a chair out there. But, I don’t know, when it comes right down to it—” “Henry.” Boney could stand it no longer. “You are a fool. Bullwhipping the brush...don’t yousee you’re the one gettin’ bullwhipped? You! Ever since...But I told you, all along I told you—” “Ever since what, Boney?” Henry asked pleasantly. “Since I told you that there is no mortal bein’ capable of—of enduring all alone this country! We are in this together! Man... man has got to—” “Ever since what, Boney?” Henry still wanted to know. “What? Ever since I . . . What?” sometimes a great notion Henry leaned forward intently. “Since Pa run off and I stuck? Since I survived that winter? Since I built up a business that you said nobody could?” “I never had anything against men developing the land.” “But one man doin’ it? One family? Heh? Heh? When you told us time an’ again we couldn’t. A ‘community effort’ is what you always said. God. I heard that pioneer-communityagainst-the-wilds shit so much the first years my belly was run over with it.” “It was necessary. It was mortal man’s only hope against the untamed elements—” “Sounds just like your old daddy talkin’.” “—that we strive together to survive together.” “I don’t recollect as how I did much strivin’ together, but I believe I did survive. Even gained a little bit on the side.” “Look what it’s got you! Loneliness an’ despair.” “Well, I don’t know about that.” “Bedridden!” Boney stood from his chair, twisting his hands in his shirtfront. “An arm lost! Dying!” “I don’t know about that. It maybe winged, nicked me a little bit, but you got to expect that.” Boney started to say more but was stopped by a fit of rage and coughing. When the coughing stopped he took his coat from the back of the chair and stabbed his skeleton arms into the sleeves. “Out of his head with pain.” He tried to dismiss Henry as he walked toward the door. The coughing had injured his throat so his voice squeaked comically. “That’s all. Crazy with pain. And dope. He can’t think reasonable.” He wiped his mouth and stood fingering the smooth buttons of the coat. “Leavin’, Boney?” Henry inquired amiably. “Burnin’ up with fever, too, I’d bet.” But he couldn’t walk out the door. Not while out of the corner of his eye he could see that cursed imbecile grin, shellacked with tobacco, that face like the face of a heathen idol shining out against everything he knew to be holy and right, those eyes that had so long needled and irritated and made uncomfortable an existence that would have otherwise been a peaceful stretch of pleasant pessimism. He feared that if he walked out through that door that face 638 ken kesey might solidify itself in death; that way he would never escape it.... “Well, I’ll see you in the funny-papers, Boney Stokes, Bobby Stokes, sobby little Bobby Stokes ...you remember that?” That way not only would he be haunted by it for the rest of his days, but his whole past would be scooped out hollow, his whole life gutted.... “An’ listen, if you run across Hank or Joe Ben, tell ’em I said to get in here an’ bring me up to date on where we stand.” That way, if he let Henry get the last laugh, his entire world would—“What? Stand? Joe Ben?” Horrified, Hank watched the opening door stop, pull slowly closed. He saw the stiff, thoughtful pivot of Boney’s turning, and his own realization mirrored there in Boney’s yellowed eyes. “Henry . . . old man, don’t you know?” No wonder Henry had seemed in such phenomenal good spirits; he hadn’t been told. Of course, neither he nor Boney had mentioned it; it simply wasn’t the sort of thing you talked about when visiting a man recovering from a serious—“Old boy?” But that no one had told him! “What I mean, Henry ...hasn’t the doctor or the nurse or someone?” “What’s got hold of you now, Boney?” “Or about afterwards? What went on yesterday?” “I told you nobody has been up to tell me anything.” And now saw a second realization settle like a soft light over Boney’s whole face. Unconsciously, as Boney moved forward, Hank drifted farther back behind the curtain. Boney seated himself again, lighted up a large pipe, and began to speak in a pity-filled voice. He spoke quickly and confidently, without a hint of his usual cough. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1580/48169.html","bookId":1269,"book":{"id":1269,"title":"永不让步 Sometimes a Great Notion","description":"简介： 《有时冒出了一个伟大的念头》（Sometimes a Great Notion） 于1964 年出版，书名源自民歌有时冒出了一个伟大的念头/要跳入河中漂流 ，讲的是俄勒冈州某小镇两个独立谋生的伐木工人的故事，他们信奉的人生准则是永不屈服（`Never Give An Inch），虽然不如 《飞越布谷鸟...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/15/10-22-01-86-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1580","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
