{"id":12736,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"“Least that’s what I been told about you,” the man went on. Evenwrite lifted the veined bumps of his eyes to the wheedling voice and tried to gauge the success of his visit. He had personally driven all the way from Wakonda to get this report. He’d wanted to test himself on this man before dealing directly with Draeger. It had taken him nearly an hour to find the flunky’s home in Portland’s confusing street system. He’d been in the city only once before, and he’d been so furious and outraged then that he could remember it only as a red blur. That was the time his teammates at Florence had taken a collection to pay his bus fare to the Shrine All-State Game, giving him the ticket and consoling him, “You shoulda been picked, Floyd. You was a better fullback. You was screwed.” That screwing—and the resulting charity—had been brought back by the sight of the river and the lights of Portland, and the red blur as well. He’d become lost time and again, trying to follow the written directions through this blur. And he’d had no time to stop for supper. And the stale beer burned his guts. And his eyes stung; it had been a struggle camouflaging his shamefully slow reading speed by making it seem instead to be shrewd caution. And his back hurt from sitting so straight to keep his belly in. But looking now at the man’s face, he decided he’d handled it. He could tell the man was impressed by this first encounter with the District Coordinator from Wakonda. Impressed and cowed just enough. Deliberately Floyd put his beer can back on the table and wiped his hand on his thigh. “No,” he said. “That ain’t—isn’t exactly correct.” He spoke with distinguished resonance; someday he would speak to a press conference this way. “No, I went to high school at Florence, a town about ten miles south of Wakonda. I didn’t move to Wakonda till after high school. What you probably heard”— he paused, furrowing his brow to remember—“is we both played offensive fullback and defensive ends on our . . . respective teams, and all four years played right across from each other. Even at the Shrine All-State game.” That was a little risky, but he doubted if the flunky was acquainted enough with sports to realize that he could not possibly have made All-State if Hank had, both being from the same district. He took a quick look at his watch, then stood up. “Well, I got a long drive.” The union fink came off his stool by the sink and extended his hand. Evenwrite, who had once been compelled to run fifty yards down a hill to wash his paw in a creek before a visiting union dignitary would deign to touch it, now looked at the flunky’s hand as though he saw bugs between the fingers. “You done real good,” he said, then left the house. Outside he buttoned the top button of his trousers and complimented himself: pretty slick, that maneuver, pretty bygod smooth—leaving the little runt standing there with his paw stuck out and his eyes batting. Yep, he’d handled the whole business pretty smooth. Impression is the ticket. Teach ’em respect; impress ’em; show ’em you’re just as good, just as big as they are. Bigger! But when he paused to rub his eyes again before getting into his car, his hand felt very small and limp. And stranger than ever. The fingers not his own. Somebody else’s. They fumble after the car keys, nervously. The chain snaps, spraying keys into the streetlight. Jenny searches the shelves for her Saint Christopher. Gives up and instead mixes herself a drink, then goes to sit and look out through the spiderweb that laces her little shack’s lone window. Squinting, she studies the sky. A full moon leans desperately against the landward rush of small clouds. She watches, sighing. The screen buzzes in the afternoon. Someone offers a dime to the bubbling jukebox. Hank Snow comes highballing out: Mr. Engineer, take that throttle in hand ’Cause this rattler’s the fastest in the southern land. Keep movin’ on. . . . The old boltcutter props the rim of his glass of port against his lower lip and tips in the wine, watching grayly from the dusty gloom. The postman crosses a bright green lawn in New Haven, holding the card. The old house, shimmering and tiny under the dawn sky, like a pebble beneath an abalone shell, opens to emit two figures in logging garb. “He can raise one hell of a fuss for an invalid,” Hank said, shaking his head. “Invalid? Why, you’d have to cut off both legs to invalid him!” Joe Ben laughed, delighted by the stamina the old man had shown in his breakfast antics. “Oh yeah, Henry ain’t one to let a bad hand make him turn in his chips. A bad hand! Hey, how ’bout that? Two levels. I mean, a hand of cards an’ then, too, him with his arm in a cast?” “You got a great future in TV comedy,” Hank said halfheartedly. “But, you know, Joby? I truly am surprised at the hole it’s left in the show, his being laid up. Damned if it doesn’t look like we’re gonna have to find somebody to come in to help us make that quota. I sure don’t know who, though.” “Don’t you?” Joe asked. “No . . .” Hank said. “Don’t you, now?” Hank knew Joe was grinning at him, but he continued on down toward the dock, not looking at his little banty-legged cousin. “I’m havin’ Viv call everybody together for a meeting— to bring ’em up to date, I told her. I guess I’ll have to, too. Some, anyhow. But even if they knew the whole score I still don’t know of one who’d come to work that ain’t already workin’.” “You don’t?” Joe asked. Joe had known from the beginning where the conversation was leading, and enjoyed teasing Hank about the roundabout route he was taking getting there. “You can’t think of a solitary soul, huh? Sonofagun.” Hank still pretended to miss the taunt. “Oh, I suppose I’ll come up with some shirttail kin,” he said finally, as though the subject were closed for the time. “It’ll just take some time and thought.” “Yeah,” Joe said, “I suppose it will.” Then added, with as much innocence as he could muster, “Considerin’ how much time an’ thought it took comin’ up with a legitimate reason to need this particular shirttail.” He danced nimbly away from Hank down the dock, waving his metal hat in the early-morning light and hooting his amusement. In the Snag the jukebox continues barrel-assing across the countryside: I’m movin’ on, Just hear my song. . . . Floyd gets his car started and begins trying to retrace his path back out of Portland. The postman mounts the steps. Draeger finds a motel and in the office, under a softly fluttering fluorescent lamp, shakes his head and politely refuses the motel manager’s offer to buy him a drink. “I used to do some log work myself, y’know,” the manager had mentioned as soon as he found out who Draeger was. “I’m sorry, but no go on the drink,” Draeger said again. “I’ve a meeting tomorrow to prepare for. But thanks all the same. It’s been pleasant talking with you. Good night.” Outside in the buzzing glare of the neon—free tv pool heated electric blanket—he searched through his pockets sluggishly. Like Floyd, he was tired. He’d met with the owners of Wakonda Pacific Lumber at Sacramento that morning, then got right on the road; he planned to spend a few days in Red Bluff sitting in on negotiations with a grievance committee over from Susanville, then, unless matters improved, continue on up north to look into this Wakonda tie-up. And some loggerturned-farmer-turned-motelman wanted to buy him a drink. Jesus Christ! He finally found what he was searching for, a small notebook with an automatic pencil clipped to his inside coat pocket. He took it out, flipped through the pages, and in the heartbeat red of the neon wrote, “Men are forever eager to press drink upon those they consider their superiors, hoping thereby to eliminate that distinction between them.” The note-taking habit was a carry-over from his college days, when he had A’d all tests by being the most ready. He read the phrase over and smiled approvingly. He had been collecting such aphorisms for years now, and dreamed of some day compiling them into a book of essays. But even if the dream failed to come off, the little phrases came in quite handy in his work, little notes taken daily in the lesson of life. Should a test ever present itself, he would be ready.... The old house falls quiet now, with breakfast over. The kids still aren’t up. Old Henry has labored, exhausted but satisfied, back up the stairs to bed. The dogs have eaten and are asleep. Viv throws the coffee grounds out the back door into the rhododendron bed, as the sun is just chalking the tops of the firs back up in the hills. . . . The postman reaches to drop his card in the mail slot. Floyd Evenwrite finally finds the highway out and begins looking for a bar. Draeger sits on the motel bed and notes the first sign of athlete’s foot between the third and fourth toes of his right foot; already, and not even out of California. At the window of her one-room shack Indian Jenny sips her bourbon and snuff and becomes more interested in the moonlit march of clouds.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1580/46971.html","bookId":1269,"book":{"id":1269,"title":"永不让步 Sometimes a Great Notion","description":"简介： 《有时冒出了一个伟大的念头》（Sometimes a Great Notion） 于1964 年出版，书名源自民歌有时冒出了一个伟大的念头/要跳入河中漂流 ，讲的是俄勒冈州某小镇两个独立谋生的伐木工人的故事，他们信奉的人生准则是永不屈服（`Never Give An Inch），虽然不如 《飞越布谷鸟...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/15/10-22-01-86-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1580","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
