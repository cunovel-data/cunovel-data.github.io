{"id":12802,"no":80,"title":"Chapter 79","content":"The men laughed uncertainly, puzzled by the calm tact of this man. They waited, watching him at his solitary table toying with his glass. But when he didn’t go on, the crowd turned its attention back to Evenwrite, who still stood clutching his empty glass. Evenwrite felt the attention burn at his back: balls. He’d been going good before that bastard had showed up; real good. But some way Draeger had made him the fool again, though damned if he could see how. He tried to study the fact for a moment, then gave up and vented his frustration on Teddy by demanding a free glass on account of dammit for all the juice he’d throwed down in there tonight if it’d been real stuff he’d be drunk on his ear, now ain’t that so? Without comment, Teddy refilled the glass. Evenwrite drank it with a gulp, not even closing his eyes, then smacked his lips thoughtfully. “Pigeon piss,” he decided and spat in the direction of the spittoon. There was a little wave of laughter, still uncertain. The men looked back and forth from their president to their representative, waiting for the next move. Draeger seemed unaware of the silence that had risen up after his entrance; he peered through the little glass he twisted in his fingers, his eyes patient as his smile. Evenwrite leaned against the bar. He knew he was on the spot. Draeger had made it his move. He rubbed his neck and finally broke the quiet by throwing the glass at the brass pot wired to the corner of the bar and shouting “Pigeon piss” again. “That ain’t whisky, that’s pure hundred-fifty-proof pigeon piss.” There was more laughter and he turned then toward Draeger, confident again. He was leaning slightly, eyes very bright. “Okay, Jonathan Bailey Draeger, since you’re so fuckin’ smart let’s hear what you say we should do. You called this walkout the first place. Ain’t that so? Since you’re so smart, okay let’s hear what you’re gonna do to get us outa this mess. I’m jus’ a dumb-ass sawyer! I mean, nobody pays us dumb-asses to think. Since you’re so smart—” Draeger brought the glass down on the cocktail napkin on the Formica table top; there was a muffled yet resonant click, sounding at once distant and very near, like a click heard under water. “If you’ll just sit down and take it easy, Floyd—” “Ho ho. Don’t you Floyd old boy me, Jonathan Bailey Draeger. Legal? All right, if you want to be legal then, you know and I know what we gotta do. Maybe we beat our gums here the rest the night but we know! An’ me hollering to go out there after Stamper was a dumb-ass thing, sure . . . but not no more dumb-ass than you suckin’ us into this strike none of us wanted!” “Floyd, to hear you tell it last August you boys were all starving to death.” “Last August you told us we’d settle without a walkout!” “Are you scared to gut it out, Floyd? Scared you might miss a couple of paychecks?” Draeger still spoke so softly that it was difficult to tell if the voice came from him or not. Evenwrite’s voice grew louder to overpower the silence that Draeger had brought down on the room. “No, I ain’t scared to miss a couple of paychecks! I done it before. All of us have. We’ve struck before and we’ve gutted it out. We’ve gutted it out since the days before the Wobs came to back us up. And we’ll do it again, won’t we, boys?” He looked about at the men, nodding. The men nodded with him, watching Draeger. “You’re damn right. We ain’t scared to gut it or miss a couple paychecks, but we ain’t scared to back off when we’re dead whipped, neither!” “Floyd, if you’ll—” “And legally, if you want to be that way about it, we are whipped! Whipped comin’ an’ goin’.” He stopped speaking to Draeger and turned toward the men again, wiping his nose. “I been wantin’ to cash it a long time now. It was the wrong time of year to walk out; we all knew that—hell, middle of winter, not a whole lot in the strike fund—but Draeger figured if he could just swing this one he was on his way to him a big spot, make a goddam king or something of hisself ...so he got us—” “Floyd . . .” “Draeger, if you’re so fuckin’ smart—” “Floyd.” Click. Again that light, restrained touch of the glass against the table, as light as a hammer cocking. The heads swung back to Draeger. I see now; now I understand. ...From behind his bar Teddy marveled at the man’s power and timing. . . . You know how to wait. As soon as you started speaking . . . watch these idiots draw in toward you without leaving their places, straining without motion toward your voice as metal particles strain in toward a magnet ... “Floyd ...doesn’t the foreman from the Stamper mill, Orland Stamper, live right next door to you?” . . . Straining in to you without even moving; it doesn’t make any difference what you say. Because you are one of the forces yourself, a force, and that’s what matters. Not what you say. Like Walker the Healing Preacher is sometimes a force. But not that way either, because you know more than Brother Walker and his God put together... “And Sitkins, you and your brother, I heard you both have children in the same class as some of the Stamper children. It seems I recall hearing that. Those kids are just kids, aren’t they, just like your kids?” ...You know what it is—the cold force in the dark—that makes people move. And that you don’t have to have all those drums and guitars and organ music to make the idiots dance. You know that Brother Walker’s God is just a straw God, a make-do doll to wave in the face of the true All-Powerful. . . . “And the Stamper wives, aren’t they just women? Worried just like any women about how their house looks for company? What the new hairdo is?—and, boy oh boy, have you men seen some of those styles?—just like any woman, the Stamper wives?” ...A make-do deity doll, not even as powerful as the other make-do gods like What the Fool Next Door Thinks, and The Great Things to Be Done . . . none of them a fraction as powerful or terrible as the Force that created them, the Fear that created them. “Men...Floyd ...there are one or two things to keep in mind: that it doesn’t make any difference what their name is— they want the same things from life that you want, the same things you men fought for when we put this union together, the same things you want now...because it’s natural.” .... Natural for animals to bunch together for protection. You don’t need drums and guitars. No. All you need is just to have people around with the natural fear, like all a magnet needs to be a force is just the pieces of iron to pull against. “I take my stand behind the human heart, not alongside violence . . .” . . . Not be right or wrong or good or bad, just be pulling. In a minute the idiots won’t even be listening, they’ll just be pulling. They don’t have to think. Just be afraid naturally and pulling together. Like specks of mercury rolling into the big piece. Like little specks of mercury rolling into bigger specks and then bigger and then just one piece, and nothing to be scared about or hurt about because you’re just a piece of a bigger piece getting bigger rolling across the land into an ocean of mercury . . . “So here is what I’ve been doing the last four days, over in Eugene—toward the benefit of all, with no violence, no bloodshed . . . I’ve been appropriating funds from the union treasury . . .” . . . And you know all this, Mr. Draeger. It is the thing that makes you special. And you have the courage to use it. I can only stand awed by the true All-Powerful; you can use it. You are beautiful . . . “What are you driving at, Draeger?” Evenwrite asked, feeling suddenly tired again. “Not quite all we need, perhaps,” Draeger continued as though he hadn’t heard Evenwrite, “but I am sure some local businessman with a little capital and a shrewd investment eye can raise the rest of the money....” “Muddy for what, Draeger?” Draeger smiled sadly at Floyd. “You’ve got a dilly of one, haven’t you, Floyd? Too bad; especially since we have to take us another little joyride up the river and have another talk with Mr. Stamper.” “Now just a goddam minute! I know this man, he’s less likely now than he was a week ago to change his—” Evenwrite squinted at Draeger. “Money for what? I asked.” “We are going to buy the Stamper Enterprises, Floyd, lock, stock and barrel, kit and kaboo—” “He won’t sell,” Evenwrite said, a little desperately. “Hank Stamper? Never . . .” “I think he will. I talked to him on the phone. I quoted some figures that he would be a fool to pass up—” “He said yes? Hank Stamper?” “Not absolutely, no, but I don’t see what would stop him. He’ll never get a better offer.” Draeger turned back to the others, shrugging. “The price will be a little stiff, men, but he had us by the short hairs, as Floyd puts it. It will still work out to our advantage: the business will be owned locally, in conjunction with the union; the investors will share in the profits; the Wakonda Pacific will be over a barrel. . . .” Teddy listened through his thoughts to the muffled, distant voice and fell in love from behind his barricade of rainbows. Evenwrite leaned against the bar, stunned completely sober. He didn’t listen to the rest of the excited questions, or Draeger’s optimistic plans. For a while, the prospect of another river trip almost jolted him out of his stupor, but when he raised his head to protest he saw all the other men so enthusiastic that he couldn’t bring himself to speak. And when Draeger left in the direction of Mama Olson’s he put on his coat and docilely followed along. On the street outside he shook his head and repeated, “Hank Stamper . . . just won’t sell.” “What difference?” Draeger said happily. “We aren’t even going to make an offer.” “Then where we going?” “Just for a walk, Floyd. A stroll. I just thought folks would be more inclined to believe we made that offer if we strolled down toward the docks. . . .” “Believe? What are you talking about? Hank Stamper’ll never believe we went up to his place just because we—” “But he’ll be the only one who won’t believe it, Floyd.” He chuckled, confident. “By the way, do you play cribbage? Fine game for two. Come on; I have a board up in my hotel room....There should be just about enough time to teach you while we supposedly have another ‘joyride.’ ” And back in the bar Teddy, standing in his spot by the window, is the only one to see them double back from the docks and duck into the side door of the hotel. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1580/47058.html","bookId":1269,"book":{"id":1269,"title":"永不让步 Sometimes a Great Notion","description":"简介： 《有时冒出了一个伟大的念头》（Sometimes a Great Notion） 于1964 年出版，书名源自民歌有时冒出了一个伟大的念头/要跳入河中漂流 ，讲的是俄勒冈州某小镇两个独立谋生的伐木工人的故事，他们信奉的人生准则是永不屈服（`Never Give An Inch），虽然不如 《飞越布谷鸟...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/15/10-22-01-86-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1580","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
