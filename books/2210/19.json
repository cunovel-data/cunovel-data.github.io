I had a new sword with a deep-carved silver handle and the usual heavy, ornate buckles on my shoes, the usual lace gloves, tricorne. And I came to the theater in a hired carriage.\\n\\n But as soon as I paid the driver I went back the alley and opened the stage door exactly as I used to do.\\n\\n At once the old atmosphere surrounded me, the smell of the thick greasepaint and the cheap costumes full of sweat and perfume, and the dust. I could see a fragment of the lighted stage burning beyond the helter-skelter of hulking props and hear bursts of laughter from the hall. A group of acrobats waited to go on at the intermezzo, a crowd of jesters in red tights, caps and dagged collars studded with little gold bells.\\n\\n I felt dizzy, and for a moment afraid. The place felt close and dangerous over my head, and yet it was wonderful to be inside it again. And a sadness was swelling inside me, no, a panic, actually.\\n\\n Luchina saw me and she let out a shriek. Doors opened everywhere on the cluttered little dressing rooms. Renaud plunged toward me and pumped my hand. Where there had been nothing but wood and drapery a moment before, there was now a little universe of excited human beings, faces full of high color and dampness, and I found myself drawing back from a smoking candelabra with the quick words, \"My eyes ... put it out.\"\\n\\n \"Put out the candles, they hurt his eyes, can\u0027t you see that?\" Jeannette insisted sharply. I felt her wet lips open against my face. Everyone was around me, even the acrobats who didn\u0027t know me, and the old scene painters and carpenters who had taught me so many things. Luchina said, \"Get Nicki,\" and I almost cried No.\\n\\n Applause was shaking the little house. The curtain was being pulled closed from either side. At once the old actors were upon me, and Renaud was calling for champagne.\\n\\n I was holding my hands over my eyes as if like the basilisk I\u0027d kill every one of them if I looked at them, and I could feel tears and knew that before they saw the blood in the tears, I had to wipe the tears away. But they were so close I couldn\u0027t get to my handkerchief, and with a sudden terrible weakness, I put my arms around Jeannette and Luchina, and I pressed my face against Luchina\u0027s face. Like birds they were, with bones full of air, and hearts like beating wings, and for one second I listened with a vampire\u0027s ear to the blood in them, but that seemed an obscenity. And I just gave in to the hugging and the kissing, ignoring the thump of their hearts, and holding them and smelling their powdered skin, and feeling again the press of their lips.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know how you worried us!\" Renaud was booming. \"And then the stories of your good fortune! Everyone, everyone!\" He was clapping his hands. \"It\u0027s Monsieur de Valois, the owner of this great theatrical establishment. . .\" and he said a lot of other pompous and playful things, dragging up the new actors and actresses to kiss my hand, I suppose, or my feet. I was holding tight to the girls as if I\u0027d explode into fragments if I let them go, and then I heard Nicki, and knew he was only a foot away, staring at me, and that he was too glad to see me to be hurt anymore.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t open my eyes but I felt his hand on my face, then holding tight to the back of my neck. They must have made way for him and when he came into my arms, I felt a little convulsion of terror, but the light was dim here, and I had fed furiously to be warm and human-looking, and I thought desperately I don\u0027t know to whom I pray to make the deception work. And then there was only Nicolas and I didn\u0027t care.\\n\\n I looked up and into his face.\\n\\n How to describe what humans look like to us! I\u0027ve tried to describe it a little, when I spoke of Nicki\u0027s beauty the night before as a mixture of movement and color. But you can\u0027t imagine what it\u0027s like for us to look on living flesh. There are those billions of colors and tiny configurations of movement, yes, that make up a living creature on whom we concentrate.\\n\\n But the radiance mingles totally with the carnal scent. Beautiful, that\u0027s what any human being is to us, if we stop to consider it, even the old and the diseased, the downtrodden that one doesn\u0027t really \"see\" in the street. They are all like that, like flowers ever in the process of opening, butterflies ever unfolding out of the cocoon.\\n\\n Well, I saw all this when I saw Nicki, and I smelled the blood pumping in him, and for one heady moment I felt love and only love obliterating every recollection of the horrors that had deformed me. Every evil rapture, every new power with its gratification, seemed unreal. Maybe I felt a profound joy, too, that I could still love, if I\u0027d ever doubted it, and that a tragic victory had been confirmed.\\n\\n All the old mortal comfort intoxicated me, and I could have closed my eyes and slipped from consciousness carrying him with me, or so it seemed.\\n\\n But something else stirred in me, collecting strength so fast my mind raced to catch up with it and deny it even as it threatened to grow out of control. And I knew it for what it was, something monstrous and enormous and natural to me as the sun was unnatural. I wanted Nicki. I wanted him as surely as any victim I\u0027d ever struggled with in the Ile de la Cite. I wanted his blood flowing into me, wanted its taste and its smell and its heat.\\n\\n The little place shook with shouts and laughter, Renaud telling the acrobats to get on with the intermezzo and Luchina opening the champagne. But we were closed off in this embrace.\\n\\n The hard heat of his body made me stiffen and draw back, though it seemed I didn\u0027t move at all. And it maddened me suddenly that this one whom I loved even as I loved my mother and my brothers -- this one who had drawn from me the only tenderness I\u0027d ever felt -- was an unconquerable citadel, holding fast in ignorance against my thirst for blood when so many hundreds of victims had so easily given it up.\\n\\n This was what I\u0027d been made for. This was the path I had been meant to walk. What were those others to me now -- the thieves and killers I\u0027d cut down in the wilderness of Paris? This was what I wanted. And the great awesome possibility of Nicki\u0027s death exploded in my brain. The darkness against my closed eyelids had become blood red. Nicki\u0027s mind emptying in that last moment, giving up its complexity with its life.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t move. I could feel the blood as if it were passing into me and I let my lips rest against his neck. Every particle in me said, \"Take him, spirit him out of this place and away from it and feed on him and feed on him... until...\" Until what! Until he\u0027s dead!\\n\\n I broke loose and pushed him away. The crowd around us roared and rattled. Renaud was shouting at the acrobats, who stood staring at these proceedings. The audience outside demanded the intermezzo entertainment with a steady rhythmic clap. The orchestra was fiddling away at the lively ditty that would accompany the acrobats. Bones and flesh poked and pushed at me. A shambles it had become, rank with the smell of those ready for the slaughter. I felt the all too human rise of nausea.\\n\\n Nicki seemed to have lost his equilibrium, and when our eyes met, I felt the accusations emanating from him. I felt the misery and, worse, the near despair.\\n\\n I pushed past all of them, past the acrobats with the jingling bells, and I don\u0027t know why I went forward to the wings instead of out the side door. I wanted to see the stage. I wanted to see the audience. I wanted to penetrate deeper into something for which I had no name or word.\\n\\n But I was mad in these moments. To say I wanted or I thought makes no sense at all.\\n\\n My chest was heaving and the thirst was like a cat clawing to get out. And as I leaned against the wooden beam beside the curtain, Nicki, hurt and misunderstanding everything, came to me again.\\n\\n I let the thirst rage. I let it tear at my insides. I just clung to the rafter and I saw in one great recollection all my victims, the scum of Paris, scraped up from its gutters, and I knew the madness of the course I\u0027d chosen, and the lie of it, and what I really was. What a sublime idiocy that I had dragged that paltry morality with me, striking down the damned ones onlyseeking to be saved in spite of it all? What had I thought I was, a righteous partner to the judges and executioners of Paris who strike down the poor for crimes that the rich commit every day?\\n\\n Strong wine I\u0027d had, in chipped and broken vessels, and now the priest was standing before me at the foot of the altar with the golden chalice in his hands, and the wine inside it was the Blood of the Lamb.\\n\\n Nicki was talking rapidly:\\n\\n \"Lestat, what is it? Tell me!\" as if the others couldn\u0027t hear us. \"Where have you been? What\u0027s happened to you? Lestat!\"\\n\\n \"Get on that stage!\" Renaud thundered at the gaping acrobats. They trotted past us into the smoky blaze of the footlamps and went into a chain of somersaults.\\n\\n The orchestra made its instruments into twittering birds. A flash of red, harlequin sleeves, bells jangling, taunts from the unruly crowd, \"Show us something, really show us something!\"\\n\\n Luchina kissed me and I stared at her white throat, her milky hands. I could see the veins in Jeannette\u0027s face and the soft cushion of her lower lip coming ever closer. The champagne, splashed into dozens of little glasses, was being drunk. Some speech was issuing forth from Renaud about our \"partnership\" and how tonight\u0027s little farce was but the beginning and we would soon be the grandest theater on the boulevards. I saw myself decked out for the part of Lelio, and heard the ditty I had sung to Flaminia on bended knee.\\n\\n Before me, little mortals flip-flopped heavily and the audience was howling as the leader of the acrobats made some vulgar movement with his hind end.\\n\\n Before I even meant to do it, I had gone out on the stage.\\n\\n I was standing in the very center, feeling the heat of the footlights, the smoke stinging my eyes. I stared at the crowded gallery, the screened boxes, the rows and rows of spectators to the back wall. And I heard myself snarl a command for the acrobat to get away.\\n\\n It seemed the laughter was deafening, and the taunts and shouts that greeted me were spasms and eruptions, and quite plainly behind every face in the house was a grinning skull. I was humming the little ditty I\u0027d sung as Lelio, no more than a fragment of the part, but the one I\u0027d carried in the streets afterwards with me, \"lovely, lovely, Flaminia,\" and on and on, the words forming meaningless sounds.\\n\\n Insults were cutting through the din.\\n\\n \"On with the performance!\" and \"You\u0027re handsome enough, now let\u0027s see some action!\" From the gallery someone threw a half-eaten apple that came thumping just past my feet.\\n\\n I unclasped the violet roquelaure and let it fall. I did the same with the silver sword.\\n\\n The song had become an incoherent humming behind my lips, but mad poetry was pounding in my head. I saw the wilderness of beauty and its savagery, the way I\u0027d seen it last night when Nicki was playing, and the moral world seemed some desperate dream of rationality that in this lush and fetid jungle had not the slightest chance. It was a vision and I saw rather than understood, except that I was part of it, natural as the cat with her exquisite and passionless face digging her claws into the back of the screaming rat.\\n\\n \" `Handsome enough\u0027 is this Grim Reaper,\" I half uttered, \"who can snuff all these `brief candles,\u0027 every fluttering soul sucking the air, from this hall.\"\\n\\n But the words were really beyond my reach. They floated in some stratum perhaps where a god existed who understood the colors patterned on a cobra\u0027s skin and the eight glorious notes that make up the music erupting out of Nicki\u0027s instrument, but never the principle, beyond ugliness or beauty, \"Thou shalt not kill.\"\\n\\n Hundreds of greasy faces peered back at me from the gloom. Shabby wigs and paste jewels and filthy finery, skin like water flowing over crooked bones. A crew of ragged beggars whistled and hooted from the gallery, humpback and one eye, and stinking underarm crutch, and teeth the color of the skull\u0027s teeth you sift from the dirt of the grave.\\n\\n I threw out my arms. I crooked my knee, and I began turning as the acrobats and dancers could turn, round and round on the ball of one foot, effortlessly, going faster and faster, until I broke, flipping over backwards into a circle of cartwheels, and then somersaults, imitating everything I had ever seen the players at the fairs perform.\\n\\n Applause came immediately. I was agile as I\u0027d been in the village, and the stage was tiny and hampering, and the ceiling seemed to press down on me, and the smoke from the footlights to close me in. The little song to Flaminia came back to me and I started singing it loudly as I turned and jumped and spun again, and then gazing at the ceiling I willed my body upwards as I bent my knees to spring.\\n\\n In an instant I touched the rafters and I was dropping down gracefully, soundlessly to the boards.\\n\\n Gasps rose from the audience. The little crowd in the wings was stunned. The musicians in the pit who had been silent all the while were turning to one another. They could see there was no wire.\\n\\n But I was soaring again to the delight of the audience, this time somersaulting all the way up, beyond the painted arch again to descend in even slower, finer turns.\\n\\n Shouts and cheers broke out over the clapping, but those backstage were mute. Nicki stood at the very edge, his lips silently shaping my name.\\n\\n \"It has to be trickery, an illusion.\" The same avowals came from all directions. People demanded agreement from those around them. Renaud\u0027s face shone before me for an instant with gaping mouth and squinting eyes.\\n\\n But I had gone into a dance again. And this time the grace of it no longer mattered to the audience. I could feel it, because the dance became a parody, each gesture broader, longer, slower than a human dancer could have sustained.\\n\\n Someone shouted from the wings and was told to be still. And little cries burst from the musicians and those in the front rows. People were growing uneasy and whispering to one another, but the rabble in the gallery continued to clap.\\n\\n I dashed suddenly towards the audience as if I meant to admonish it for its rudeness. Several persons were so startled they rose and tried to escape into the aisles. One of the hornplayers dropped his instrument and climbed out of the pit.\\n\\n I could see the agitation, even the anger in their faces. What were these illusions? It wasn\u0027t amusing them suddenly; they couldn\u0027t comprehend the skill of it; and something in my serious manner made them afraid. For one terrible moment, I felt their helplessness.\\n\\n And I felt their doom.\\n\\n A great horde of jangling skeletons snared in flesh and rags, that\u0027s what they were, and yet their courage blazed out of them, they shouted at me in their irrepressible pride.\\n\\n I raised my hands slowly to command their attention, and very loudly and steadily I sang the ditty to Flaminia, my lovely Flaminia, a dull little couplet spilling into another couplet, and I let my voice grow louder and louder until suddenly people were rising and screaming before me, but louder still I sang it until it obliterated every other noise and in the intolerable roar I saw them all, hundreds of them, overturning the benches as they stood up, their hands clamped to the sides of their heads.\\n\\n Their mouths were grimaces, toneless screams.\\n\\n Pandemonium. Shrieks, curses, all stumbling and struggling towards the doors. Curtains were pulled from their fastenings. Men dropped down from the gallery to rush for the street.\\n\\n I stopped the horrid song.\\n\\n I stood watching them in a ringing silence, the weak, sweating bodies straining clumsily in every direction. The wind gusted from the open doorways, and I felt a strange coldness over all my limbs and it seemed my eyes were made of glass.\\n\\n Without looking, I picked up the sword and put it on again, and hooked my finger into the velvet collar of my crumpled and dusty roquelaure. All these gestures seemed as grotesque as everything else I had done, and it seemed of no import that Nicolas was trying to get loose from two of the actors who held him in fear of his life as he shouted my name.\\n\\n But something out of the chaos caught my attention. It did seem to matter -- to be terribly, terribly important, in fact that there was a figure standing above in one of the open boxes who did not struggle to escape or even move.\\n\\n I turned slowly and looked up at him, daring him, it seemed, to remain there. An old man he was, and his dull gray eyes were boring into me with stubborn outrage, and as I glared at him, I heard myself let out a loud open-mouthed roar. Out of my soul it seemed to come, this sound. It grew louder and louder until those few left below cowered again with their ears stopped, and even Nicolas, rushing forward, buckled beneath the sound of it, both hands clasped to his head.\\n\\n And yet the man stood there in the loge glowering, indignant and old, and stubborn, with furrowed brows under his gray wig.\\n\\n I stepped back and leapt across the empty house, landing in the box directly before him, and his jaw fell in spite of himself and his eyes grew hideously wide.\\n\\n He seemed deformed with age, his shoulders rounded, his hands gnarled, but the spirit in his eyes was beyond vanity and beyond compromise. His mouth hardened and his chin jutted. And from under his frock coat he pulled his pistol and he aimed it at me with both hands.\\n\\n \" Lestat!\" Nicki shouted.\\n\\n But the shot exploded and the ball hit me with full force. I didn\u0027t move. I stood as steady as the old man had stood before, and the pain rolled through me and stopped, leaving in its wake a terrible pulling in all my veins.\\n\\n The blood poured out. It flowed as I have never seen blood flow. It drenched my shirt and I could feel it spilling down my back. But the pulling grew stronger and stronger, and a warm tingling sensation had commenced to spread across the surface of my back and chest.\\n\\n The man stared, dumbfounded. The pistol dropped out of his hand. His head went back, eyes blind, and his body crumpled as if the air had been let out of it, and he lay on the floor.\\n\\n Nicki had raced up the stairs and was now rushing into the box. A low hysterical murmuring was issuing from him. He thought he was witnessing my death.\\n\\n And I stood still hearkening to my body in that terrible solitude that had been mine since Magnus made me the vampire. And I knew the wounds were no longer there.\\n\\n The blood was drying on the silk vest, drying on the back of my torn coat. My body throbbed where the bullet had passed through me and my veins were alive with the same pulling, but the injury was no more.\\n\\n And Nicolas, coming to his senses as he looked at me, realized I was unharmed, though his reason told him it couldn\u0027t be true.\\n\\n I pushed past him and made for the stairs. He flung himself against me and I threw him off. I couldn\u0027t stand the sight of him, the smell of him.\\n\\n \"Get away from me!\" I said.\\n\\n But he came back again and he locked his arm around my neck. His face was bloated and there was an awful sound coming out of him.\\n\\n \"Let go of me. Nicki!\" I threatened him. If I shoved him off too roughly, I\u0027d tear his arms out of the sockets, break his back.\\n\\n Break his back . . .\\n\\n He moaned, stuttered. And for one harrowing split second the sounds he made were as terrible as the sound that had come from my dying animal on the mountain, my horse, crushed like an insect into the snow.\\n\\n I scarcely knew what I was doing when I pried loose his hands.\\n\\n The crowd broke, screaming, when I walked out onto the boulevard.\\n\\n Renaud ran forward, in spite of those trying to restrain him.\\n\\n \"Monsieur!\" He grabbed my hand to kiss it and stopped, staring at the blood.\\n\\n \"Nothing, my dear Renaud,\" I said to him, quite surprised at the steadiness of my voice and its softness. But something distracted me as I started to speak again, something I should hearken to, I thought vaguely, yet I went on.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t give it a thought, my dear Renaud,\" I said. \"Stage blood, nothing but an illusion. It was all an illusion. A new kind of theatrical. Drama of the grotesque, yes, the grotesque.\"\\n\\n But again came that distraction, something I was sensing in the melee around me, people shuffling and pushing to get close but not too close, Nicolas stunned and staring.\\n\\n \"Go on with your plays,\" I was saying, almost unable to concentrate on my own words, \"Your acrobats, your tragedies, your more civilized theatricals, if you like.\"\\n\\n I pulled the bank notes out of my pocket and put them in his unsteady hand. I spilled gold coins onto the pavement. The actors darted forward fearfully to gather them up. I scanned the crowd around for the source of this strange distraction, what was it, not Nicolas in the door of the deserted theater, watching me with a broken soul.\\n\\n No, something else both familiar and unfamiliar, having to do with the dark.\\n\\n \"Hire the finest mummers,\" I was half babbling, \"the best musicians, the great scene painters.\" More bank notes. My voice was getting loud again, the vampire voice, I could see the grimaces again and the hands going up, but they were afraid to let me see them cover their ears. \"There is no limit, NO LIMIT, to what you can do here!\"\\n\\n I broke away, dragging my roquelaure with me, the sword clanking awkwardly because it was not buckled right. Something of the dark.\\n\\n And I knew when I hurried into the first alleyway and started to run what it was that I had heard, what had distracted me, it had been the presence, undeniably, in the crowd!\\n\\n I knew it for one simple reason: I was running now in the back streets faster than a mortal can run. And the presence was keeping time with me and the presence was more than one!\\n\\n I came to a halt when I knew it for certain.\\n\\n I was only a mile from the boulevard and the crooked alley around me narrow and black as any in which I had ever been. And I heard them before they seemed, quite purposefully and abruptly, to silence themselves.\\n\\n I was too anxious and miserable to play with them! I was too dazed. I shouted the old question, \"Who are you, speak to me!\" The glass panes rattled in the nearby windows. Mortals stirred in their little chambers. There was no cemetery here. \"Answer me, you pack of cowards. Speak if you have a voice or once and for all get away from me!\"\\n\\n And then I knew, though how I knew, I can\u0027t tell you, that they could hear me and they could answer me, if they chose. And I knew that what I had always heard was the irrepressible evidence of their proximity and their intensity, which they could disguise. But their thoughts they could cloak and they had. I mean, they had intellect, and they had words.\\n\\n I let out a long low breath.\\n\\n I was stung by their silence, but I was stung a thousand times more by what had just happened, and as I\u0027d done so many times in the past I turned my back on them.\\n\\n They followed me. This time they followed, and no matter how swiftly I moved, they came on.\\n\\n And I did not lose the strange toneless shimmer of them until I reached the place de Greve and went into the Cathedral of Notre Dame.\\n\\n I spent the remainder of the night in the cathedral, huddled in a shadowy place by the right wall. I hungered for the blood I\u0027d lost, and each time a mortal drew near I felt a strong pulling and tingling where the wounds had been.\\n\\n But I waited.\\n\\n And when a young beggar woman with a little child approached, I knew the moment had come. She saw the dried blood, and became frantic to get me to the nearby hospital, the Hotel-Dieu. Her face was thin with hunger, but she tried to lift me herself with her little arms.\\n\\n I looked into her eyes until I saw them glaze over. I felt the heat of her breasts swelling beneath her rags. Her soft, succulent body tumbled against me, giving itself to me, as I nestled her in all the bloodstained brocade and lace. I kissed her, feeding on her heat as I pushed the dirty cloth away from her throat, and I bent for the drink so skillfully that the sleepy child never saw it. Then I opened with careful trembling fingers the child\u0027s ragged shirt. This was mine, too, this little neck.\\n\\n There weren\u0027t any words for the rapture. Before I\u0027d had all the ecstasy that rape could give. But these victims had been taken in the perfect semblance of love. The very blood seemed warmer with their innocence, richer with their goodness.\\n\\n I looked at them afterwards, as they slept together in death. They had found no sanctuary in the cathedral on this night.\\n\\n And I knew my vision of the garden of savage beauty had been a true vision. There was meaning in the world, yes, and laws, and inevitability, but they had only to do with the aesthetic. And in this Savage Garden, these innocent ones belonged in the vampire\u0027s arms. A thousand other things can be said about the world, but only aesthetic principles can be verified, and these things alone remain the same.\\n\\n I was now ready to go home. And as I went out in the early morning, I knew that the last barrier between my appetite and the world had been dissolved.\\n\\n No one was safe from me now, no matter how innocent. And that included my dear friends at Renaud\u0027s and it included my beloved Nicki. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-lestat-the-vampire-chronicles-2/page-19.html","bookId":2210,"book":{"id":2210,"title":"The Vampire Lestat (The Vampire Chronicles #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vampire Lestat (The Vampire Chronicles #2) \\n Once an aristocrat in the heady days of pre-revolutionary France, now Lestat is a rockstar in the demonic, shimmering 1980s.
