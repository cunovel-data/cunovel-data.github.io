{"id":102182,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Part II The Legacy of Magnus\n 1\n It must have been three o\u0027clock in the morning; I\u0027d heard the church bells in my sleep.\n And like all sensible men in Paris, we had our door barred and our window locked. Not good for a room with a coal fire, but the roof was a path to our window. And we were locked in.\n I was dreaming of the wolves. I was on the mountain and surrounded and I was swinging the old medieval flail. Then the wolves were dead again, and the dream was better, only I had all those miles to walk in the snow. The horse screamed in the snow. My mare turned into a loathsome insect half smashed on the stone floor.\n A voice said \"Wolfkiller\" long and low, a whisper that was like a summons and a tribute at the same time.\n I opened my eyes. Or I thought I did. And there was someone standing in the room. A tall, bent figure with its back to the little hearth. Embers still glowed on the hearth. The light moved upwards, etching the edges of the figure clearly, then dying out before it reached the shoulders, the head. But I realized I was looking right at the white face I\u0027d seen in the audience at the theater, and my mind, opening, sharpening, realized the room was locked, that Nicolas lay beside me, that this figure stood over our bed.\n I heard Nicolas\u0027s breathing. I looked into the white face.\n \"Wolfkiller,\" came the voice again. But the lips hadn\u0027t moved, and the figure drew nearer and I saw that the face was no mask. Black eyes, quick and calculating black eyes, and white skin, and some appalling smell coming from it, like the smell of moldering clothes in a damp room.\n I think I rose up. Or perhaps I was lifted. Because in an instant I was standing on my feet. The sleep was slipping off me like garments. I was backing up into the wall.\n The figure had my red cloak in its hands. Desperately I thought of my sword, my muskets. They were under the bed on the floor. And the thing thrust the red cloak towards me and then, through the fur-lined velvet, I felt its hand close on the lapel of my coat.\n I was torn forward. I was drawn off my feet across the room. I shouted for Nicolas. I screamed, \"Nicki, Nicki!\" as loud as I could. I saw the partially opened window, and then suddenly the glass burst into thousands of fragments and the wooden frame was broken out. I was flying over the alleyway, six stories above the ground.\n I screamed. I kicked at this thing that was carrying me. Caught up in the red cloak, I twisted, trying to get loose.\n But we were flying over the rooftop, and now going up the straight surface of a brick wall! I was dangling in the arm of the creature, and then very suddenly on the surface of a high place, I was thrown down.\n I lay for a moment seeing Paris spread out before me in a great circle -- the white snow, and chimney pots and church belfries, and the lowering sky. And then I rose up, stumbling over the fur-lined cloak, and I started to run. I ran to the edge of the roof and looked down. Nothing but a sheer drop of hundreds of feet, and then to another edge and it was exactly the same. I almost fell!\n I turned desperate, panting. We were on the top of some square tower, no more than fifty feet across! And I could see nothing higher in any direction. And the figure stood staring at me, and I heard come out of it a low rasping laughter just like the whisper before.\n \"Wolfkiller,\" it said again.\n \"Damn you!\" I shouted. \"Who the hell are you!\" And in a rage I flew at it with my fists.\n It didn\u0027t move. I struck it as if I were striking the brick wall. I veritably bounced off it, losing my footing in the snow and scrambling up and attacking it again.\n Its laughter grew louder and louder, and deliberately mocking, but with a strong undercurrent of pleasure that was even more maddening than the mockery. I ran to the edge of the tower and then fumed on the creature again.\n \"What do you want with me!\" I demanded. \"Who are you!\" And when it gave nothing but this maddening laughing, I went for it again. But this time I went for the face and the neck, and I made my hands like claws to do it, and I pulled off the hood and saw the creature\u0027s black hair and the full shape of its human-looking head. Soft skin. Yet it was as immovable as before.\n It backed up a little, raising its arms to play with me, to push me back and forth as a man would push a little child. Too fast for my eyes, it moved its face away from me, fuming to one side and then the other, and all of these movements with seeming effortlessness, as I frantically tried to hurt it and could feel nothing but that soft white skin sliding under my fingers and maybe once or twice its fine black hair.\n \"Brave strong little Wolfkiller,\" it said to me now in a rounder, deeper voice.\n I stopped, panting and covered with sweat, staring at it and seeing the details of its face. The deep lines I had only glimpsed in the theater, its mouth drawn up in a jester\u0027s smile.\n \"Oh, God help me; help me...\" I said as I backed away. It seemed impossible that such a face should move, show expression, and gaze with such affection on me as it did. \"God!\"\n \"What god is that, Wolfkiller?\" it asked.\n I turned my back on it, and let out a terrible roar. I felt its hands close on my shoulders like things forged of metal, and as I went into a last frenzy of struggling, it whipped me around so that its eyes were sight before me, wide and dark, and the lips were closed yet still smiling, and then it bent down and I felt the prick of its teeth on my neck.\n Out of all the childhood tales, the old fables, the name came to me, like a drowned thing shooting to the surface of black water and breaking free in the light.\n \"Vampire!\" I gave one last frantic cry, shoving at the creature with all I had.\n Then there was silence. Stillness.\n I knew that we were still on the roof. I knew that I was being held in the thing\u0027s arms. Yet it seemed we had risen, become weightless, were traveling through the darkness even more easily than we had traveled before.\n \"Yes, yes,\" I wanted to say, \"exactly.\"\n And a great noise was echoing all around me, enveloping me, the sound of a deep gong perhaps, being struck very slowly in perfect rhythm, its sound washing through me so that I felt the most extraordinary pleasure through all my limbs.\n My lips moved, but nothing came out of them; yet this didn\u0027t really matter. All the things I had ever wanted to say were clear to me and that is what mattered, not that they be expressed. And there was so much time, so much sweet time in which to say anything and do anything. There was no urgency at all.\n Rapture. I said the word, and it seemed clear to me, that one word, though I couldn\u0027t speak or really move my lips. And I realized I was no longer breathing. Yet something was making me breathe. It was breathing for me and the breaths came with the rhythm of the gong which was nothing to do with my body, and I loved it, the rhythm, the way that it went on and on, and I no longer had to breathe or speak or know anything.\n My mother smiled at me. And I said, \"I love you...\" to her, and she said, \"Yes, always loved, always loved...\" And I was sitting in the monastery library and I was twelve years old and the monk said to me, \"A great scholar,\" and I opened all the books and could read everything, Latin, Greek, French. The illuminated letters were indescribably beautiful, and I fumed around and faced the audience in Renaud\u0027s theater and saw all of them on their feet, and a woman moved the painted fan from in front of her face, and it was Marie Antoinette. She said \"Wolfkiller,\" and Nicolas was running towards me, crying for me to come back. His face was full of anguish. His hair was loose and his eyes were rimmed with blood. He tried to catch me. I said, \"Nicki, get away from me!\" and I realized in agony, positive agony, that the sound of the gong was fading away.\n I cried out, I begged. Don\u0027t stop it, please, please. I don\u0027t want to ... I don\u0027t ... please.\n \"Lelio, the Wolfkiller,\" said the thing, and it was holding me in its arms and I was crying because the spell was breaking.\n \"Don\u0027t, don\u0027t.\"\n I was heavy all over, my body had come back to me with its aches and its pains and my own choking cries, and I was being lifted, thrown upwards, until I fell over the creature\u0027s shoulder and I felt its arm around my knees.\n I wanted to say God protect me, I wanted to say it with every particle of me but I couldn\u0027t say it, and there was the alleyway below me again, that drop of hundreds of feet, and the whole of Paris tilted at an appalling angle, and there was the snow and the searing wind. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-lestat-the-vampire-chronicles-2/page-8.html","bookId":2210,"book":{"id":2210,"title":"The Vampire Lestat (The Vampire Chronicles #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vampire Lestat (The Vampire Chronicles #2) \n Once an aristocrat in the heady days of pre-revolutionary France, now Lestat is a rockstar in the demonic, shimmering 1980s.
