{"id":102203,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"9 After a long moment, I felt her stiffen. She was looking towards the square. \"Don\u0027t think of Nicolas,\" she said. \"They are waiting and they are listening. They are hearing everything that goes on in our minds.\" \"But what are they thinking?\" I whispered. \"What is going on in their heads?\" I could feel her concentration. I pressed her close, and looked straight at the silver light that came through the distant open doors. I could hear them too now, but just that low shimmer of sound coming from all of them collected there. But as I stared at the rain, there came over me the strongest sense of peace. IL was almost sensuous. It seemed to me we could yield to them, that it was foolish to resist them further. All things would be resolved were we merely to go out to them and give ourselves over. They would not torture Nicolas, whom they had in their power; they would not tear him limb from limb. I saw Nicolas in their hands. He wore only his lace shirt and breeches because they had taken the coat. And I heard his screams as they pulled his arms from the sockets. I cried out No, putting my own hand over my mouth so that I did not rouse the mortals in the church. Gabrielle reached up and touched my lips with her fingers. \"It\u0027s not being done to him,\" she said under her breath. \"It\u0027s merely a threat. Don\u0027t think of him.\" \"He\u0027s still alive, then,\" I whispered. \"So they want us to believe. Listen!\" There came again the sense of peace, the summons, that\u0027s what it was, to join them, the voice saying Come out of the church. Surrender to us, we welcome you, and we will not harm either of you if only you come. I turned towards the door and rose to my feet. Anxiously Gabrielle rose beside me, cautioning me again with her hand. She seemed wary of even speaking to me as we both looked at that great archway of silvery light. You are lying to us, I said. You have no power over us! It was a rolling current of defiance moving through the distant door. Surrender to you? If we do that then what\u0027s to stop you from holding the three of us? Why should we come out? Within this church we are safe; we can conceal ourselves in its deepest burial vaults. We could hunt among the faithful, drink their blood in the chapels and niches so skillfully we\u0027d never be discovered, sending our victims out confused to die in the streets afterwards. And what would you do, you who cannot even cross the door! Besides, we don\u0027t believe you have Nicolas. Show him to us. Let him come to the door and speak. Gabrielle was in a welter of confusion. She was scanning me, desperate to know what I said. And she was clearly hearing them, which I could not do when I was sending these impulses. It seemed their pulse weakened, but it had not stopped. It went on as it had before, as if I\u0027d not answered it, as if it were someone humming. It was promising truce again, and now it seemed to speak of rapture, that in the great pleasure of joining with it, all conflict would be resolved. It was sensuous again, it was beautiful. \"Miserable cowards, the lot of you.\" I sighed. I said the words aloud this time, so that Gabrielle could hear as well. \"Send Nicolas into the church.\" The hum of the voices became thin. I went on, but beyond it there was a hollow silence as if other voices had been withdrawn and only one or two remained now. Then I heard the thin, chaotic strains of argument and rebellion. Gabrielle\u0027s eyes narrowed. Silence. Only mortals out there now, weaving their way against the wind across the place de Grave. I didn\u0027t believe they would withdraw. Now what do we do to save Nicki? I blinked my eyes. I felt weary suddenly; it was almost a feeling of despair. And I thought confusedly, This is ridiculous, I never despair! Others do that, not me. I go on fighting no matter what happens. Always. And in my exhaustion and anger, I saw Magnus leaping and jumping in the fire, I saw the grimace of his face before the flames consumed him and he disappeared. Was that despair? The thought paralyzed me. Horrified me as the reality of it had done then. And I had the oddest feeling that someone else was speaking to me of Magnus. That is why the thought of Magnus had come into my head! \"Too clever...\" Gabrielle whispered. \"Don\u0027t listen to it. It\u0027s playing tricks with our very thoughts,\" I said. But as I stared past her at the open doorway, I saw a small figure appear. Compact it was, the figure of a young boy, not a man. I ached for it to be Nicolas, but knew immediately that it was not. It was smaller than Nicolas, though rather heavier of build. And the creature was not human. Gabrielle made some soft wondering sound. It sounded almost like prayer in its reference. The creature wasn\u0027t dressed as men dress now. Rather he wore a belted tunic, very graceful, and stockings on his wellshaped legs. His sleeves were deep, hanging at his sides. He was clothed like Magnus, actually, and for one moment I thought madly that by some magic it was Magnus returned. Stupid thought. This was a boy, as I had said, and he had a head of long curly hair, and he walked very straight and very simply through the silvery light and into the church. He hesitated for a moment. And by the tilt of the head, it seemed he was looking up. And then he came on through the nave and towards us, his feet making not the faintest sound on the stones. He moved into the glow of the candles on the side altar. His clothes were black velvet, once beautiful, and now eaten away by time, and crusted with dirt. But his face was shining white, and perfect, the countenance of a god it seemed, a Cupid out of Caravaggio, seductive yet ethereal, with auburn hair and dark brown eyes. I held Gabrielle closer as I looked at him, and nothing so startled me about him, this inhuman creature, as the manner in which he was staring at us. He was inspecting every detail of our persons, and then he reached out very gently and touched the stone of the altar at his side. He stared at the altar, at its crucifix and its saints, and then he looked back to us. He was only a few yards away, and the soft inspection of us yielded to an expression that was almost sublime. And the voice I\u0027d heard before came out of this creature, summoning us again, calling upon us to yield, saying with indescribable gentleness that we must love one another, he and Gabrielle, whom he didn\u0027t call by name, and I. There was something naive about it, his sending the summons as he stood there. I held fast against him. Instinctively. I felt my eyes becoming opaque as if a wall had gone up to seal off the windows of my thoughts. And yet I felt such a longing for him, such a longing to fall into him and follow him and be led by him, that all my longings of the past seemed nothing at all. He was all mystery to me as Magnus had been. Only he was beautiful, indescribably beautiful, and there seemed in him an infinite complexity and depth which Magnus had not possessed. The anguish of my immortal life pressed in on me. He said, \"Come to me. Come to me because only I, and my like, can end the loneliness you feel. It touched a well of inexpressible sadness.\" It sounded the depth of the sadness, and my throat went dry with a powerful little knot where my voice might have been, yet I held fast. We two are together, I insisted, tightening my grip on Gabrielle. And then I asked him, Where is Nicolas? I asked that question and clung to it, yielding to nothing that I heard or saw. He moistened his lips; very human thing to do. And silently he approached us until he was standing no more than two feet from us, looking from one of us to the other. And in a voice very unlike a human voice, he spoke. \"Magnus,\" he said. It was unobtrusive. It was caressing. \"He went into the fire as you said?\" \"I never said it,\" I answered. The human sound of my own voice startled me. But I knew now he meant my thoughts of only moments before. \"It\u0027s quite true,\" I answered. \"He went into the fire.\" Why should I deceive anyone on that account? I tried to penetrate his mind. He knew I was doing it and he threw up against me such strange images that I gasped. What was it I\u0027d seen for an instant? I didn\u0027t even know. Hell and heaven, or both made one, vampires in a paradise drinking blood from the very flowers that hung, pendulous and throbbing, from the trees. I felt a wave of disgust. It was as if he had come into my private dreams like a succubus. But he had stopped. He let his eyes pucker slightly and he looked down out of some vague respect. My disgust was withering him. He hadn\u0027t anticipated my response. He hadn\u0027t expected ... what? Such strength? Yes, and he was letting me know it in an almost courteous way. I returned the courtesy. I let him see me in the tower room with Magnus; I recalled Magnus\u0027s words before he went into the fire. I let him know all of it. He nodded and when I told the words Magnus had said, there was a slight change in his face as if his forehead had gone smooth, or all of his skin had tightened. He gave me no such knowledge of himself in answer. On the contrary, much to my surprise, he looked away from us to the main altar of the church. He glided past us, turning his back to us as if he had nothing to fear from us and had for the moment forgotten us. He moved towards the great aisle and slowly up it, but he did not appear to walk in a human way. Rather he moved so swiftly from one bit of shadow to another that he seemed to vanish and reappear. Never was he visible in the light. And those scores of souls milling in the church had only to glance at him for him to instantly disappear. I marveled at his skill, because that is all it was. And curious to see if I could move like that, I followed him to the choir. Gabrielle came after without a sound. I think we both found it simpler than we had imagined it would be. Yet he was clearly startled when he saw us at his side. And in the very act of being startled, he gave me a glimpse of his great weakness, pride. He was humiliated that we had crept up on him, moving so lightly and managing at the same time to conceal our thoughts. But worse was to come. When he realized that I had perceived this ... it was revealed for a split second. . . he was doubly enraged. A withering heat emanated from him that wasn\u0027t heat at all. Gabrielle made a little scornful sound. Her eyes flashed on him for a second in some shimmer of communication between them that excluded me. He seemed puzzled. But he was in the grip of some greater battle I was struggling to understand. He looked at the faithful around him, and at the altar and all the emblems of the Almighty and the Virgin Mary everywhere that he turned. He was perfectly the god out of Caravaggio, the light playing on the hard whiteness of his innocent-looking face. Then he put his arm about my waist, slipping it under my cloak. His touch was so strange, so sweet and enticing, and the beauty of his face so entrancing that I didn\u0027t move away. He put his other arm around Gabrielle\u0027s waist, and the sight of them together, angel and angel, distracted me. He said: You must come. \"Why, where?\" Gabrielle asked. I felt an immense pressure. He was attempting to move me against my will, but he could not. I planted myself on the stone floor. I saw Gabrielle\u0027s face harden as she looked at him. And again, he was amazed. He was maddened and he couldn\u0027t conceal it from us. So he had underestimated our physical strength as well as our mental strength. Interesting. \"You must come now,\" he said, giving me the great force of his will, which I could see much too clearly to be fooled. \"Come out and my followers won\u0027t harm you.\" \"You\u0027re lying to us,\" I said. \"You sent your followers away, and you want us to come out before your followers return, because you don\u0027t want them to see you come out of the church. You don\u0027t want them to know you came into it!\" Again Gabrielle gave a little scornful laugh. I put my hand on his chest and tried to move him away. He might have been as strong as Magnus. But I refused to be afraid. \"Why don\u0027t you want them to see?\" i whispered, peering into his face. The change in him was so startling and so ghastly that I found myself holding my breath. His angelic countenance appeared to wither, his eyes widening and his mouth twisting down in consternation. His entire body became quite deformed as if he were trying not to grit his teeth and clench his fists. Gabrielle drew away. I laughed. I didn\u0027t really mean to, but I couldn\u0027t help it. It was horrifying. But it was also very funny. With stunning suddenness this awful illusion, if that is what it was, faded, and he came back to himself. Even the sublime expression returned. He told me in a steady stream of thought that I was infinitely stronger than he supposed. But it would frighten the others to see him emerge from the church, and so we should go at once. \"Lies again,\" Gabrielle whispered. And I knew this much pride would forgive nothing. God help Nicolas if we couldn\u0027t trick this one! Turning, I took Gabrielle\u0027s hand and we started down the aisle to the front doors, Gabrielle glancing back at him and to me questioningly, her face white and tense. \"Patience,\" I whispered. I turned to see him far away from us, his back to the main altar, and his eyes were so big as he stared that he looked horrible to me, loathsome, like a ghost. When I reached the vestibule I sent out my summons to the others with all my power. And I whispered aloud for Gabrielle as I did so. I told them to come back and into the church if they wanted to, that nothing could harm them, their leader was inside the church standing at the very altar, unharmed. I spoke the words louder, pumping the summons under the words, and Gabrielle joined me, repeating the phrases in unison with me. I felt him coming towards us from the main altar, and then suddenly I lost him. I didn\u0027t know where he was behind us. He grabbed hold of me suddenly, materializing at my side, and Gabrielle was thrown to the floor. He was attempting to lift me and pitch me through the door. But I fought him. And desperately collecting everything I remembered of Magnus -- his strange walk, and this creature\u0027s strange manner of moving -- I hurled him, not off balance as one might do to a heavy mortal, but straight up in the air. Just as I suspected, he went over in a somersault, crashing into the wall. Mortals stirred. They saw movement, heard noises. But he\u0027d vanished again. And Gabrielle and I looked no different from other young gentlemen in the shadows. I motioned for Gabrielle to get out of the way. Then he appeared, shooting towards me, but I perceived what was to happen and stepped aside. Some twenty feet away from me, I saw him sprawled on the stones staring at me with positive awe, as if I were a god. His long auburn hair was tossed about, his brown eyes enormous as he looked up. And for all the gentle innocence of his face, his will was rolling over me, a hot stream of commands, telling me I was weak and imperfect and a fool, and I would be torn limb from limb by his followers as soon as they appeared. They would roast my mortal lover slowly till he died. I laughed silently. This was as ludicrous as a fight out of the old commedia. Gabrielle was staring from one to the other of us. I sent the summons again to the others, and this time when I sent it, I heard them answering, questioning. \"Come into the church.\" I repeated it over and over, even as he rose and ran at me again in blind and clumsy rage. Gabrielle caught him just as I did, and we both had hold of him and he couldn\u0027t move. In a moment of absolute horror for me he tried to sink his fangs into my neck. I saw his eyes round and empty as the fangs descended over his drawn lip. I flung him back and again he vanished. They were coming nearer, the others. \"He\u0027s in the church, your leader, look at him!\" I repeated it. \"And any of you can come into the church. You won\u0027t be hurt.\" I heard Gabrielle let out a scream of warning. And too late. He rose up right in front of me, as if out of the floor itself, and struck my jaw, jerking my head back so that I saw the church ceiling. And before I could recover, he had dealt me one fine blow in the middle of the back that sent me flying out the door and onto the stones of the square.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-lestat-the-vampire-chronicles-2/page-29.html","bookId":2210,"book":{"id":2210,"title":"The Vampire Lestat (The Vampire Chronicles #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vampire Lestat (The Vampire Chronicles #2) Once an aristocrat in the heady days of pre-revolutionary France, now Lestat is a rockstar in the demonic, shimmering 1980s.
