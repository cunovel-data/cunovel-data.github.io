{"id":21415,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"Peter was at home for a day before returning to Oxford. Hamingburgh seemed to have grown very small and quiet. He felt in coming back a loss of energy. In London he had seemed at the heart of a hundred questions. He had watched the London crowds with intimacy. They were very real. He lost this reality in the quiet streets of Hamingburgh. Life ceased to ask urgently for an explanation. He noted on his way from the station that people were moving into Miranda\u0027s empty house. But it hardly seemed to matter. Peter enjoyed one happy evening with his mother, and left for Oxford. But Oxford had disappeared. Where was the beautiful city—offering illimitable knowledge, sure wisdom, lovely authority? Peter had come into touch with life. He had craved to find order and beauty in the pageant of London. Now, in the stones of Oxford, he saw only the frozen ideas of a vanished age—serene accomplishment whose finality exasperated him. He looked from his window across the shaven green of a perfect lawn to the chapel tower. The hour chiming in quarters from a dozen bells marked off yet another small distance between Oxford and the living day.[Pg 97] His disillusion of the previous term was now openly confessed and examined. Peter was not alone. Gamaliel drew to itself some excellent brain. It was celebrated for young men prematurely wise—young men who had learned everything at twenty-two, and never afterwards added to their store. Peter became a leading character in the intellectual set. They jested in good Greek, filling their heads with knowledge they affected to despise, taking in vain the theories of their masters, merrily playing with their grand-sires\u0027 bones of learning. They snorted with delight at the efforts of their chief clerical instructor to evade the Rabelaisian Obscenities of Aristophanes or a too curious inquiry into certain social habits of old Greece. They reduced Hegel to half-sheets of paper, suggested profanely various readings for Petronius, speculated without reverence on the darker habits of mankind from Aristotle to the Junior Prior. But in all this horseplay of minds young and keen was a strain of contemptuous fatigue. Gamaliel, out of its clever youngsters, bred civil servants, politicians, or university professors. Intellectual pedantry waited for those whom Gamaliel intellectually satisfied. Intellectual cynicism—the cynicism of a firm belief that nothing is important or new—waited for those who played the game of scholarship with humour enough to find it barren. Peter, therefore, was not alone in his reaction against the formal discipline of the College, but he[Pg 98] was alone in the obstinate ardour of his youth. He had just discovered that life was absorbing. Though he sat far into many nights in scholarly gymnastics with his friends, he came away to watch the grey light creeping into a world he keenly wanted to understand. He jested only with his brain, driven to the game by physical energy and friendly emulation. He was never really touched by the cynicism and horse laughter of his set. He often left these meetings in a sudden access of desolation. Peter\u0027s directors began sadly to shake their heads. They knew the symptoms—knew he was already marked for failure. The Warden gravely reasoned with him. \"Mr. Paragon,\" he said, handing Peter his papers for the term, \"these are second class.\" Peter was mortified. His intellectual comrades mocked, but they also satisfied, their masters. Peter was of another fibre. He could do nothing without his entire heart. Various readings in Horace no longer fired him. The kick had gone out of his work. His brain was elsewhere. He took the papers in silence. He could not understand his failure. Hitherto satisfying the examiners had been for Peter a matter of course. \"You have neglected your reading?\" the Warden suggested, as Peter turned silently away. \"No, sir.\" \"Won\u0027t you take us a little more seriously?\" [Pg 99] \"I cannot be interested,\" Peter shot out impulsively. \"Is this wise?\" the Warden gravely inquired. \"We expect you to do well.\" \"I will try, sir.\" Peter was sad, but not sullen. \"You owe it to the College,\" said the Warden, drily incisive. Then he added: \"Why must you go so quickly, Mr. Paragon? You are not yet ready for things outside.\" Peter was suddenly grateful. He was, at any rate, understood. \"I will try with my whole soul,\" he ardently exclaimed. \"Meanwhile,\" the Warden concluded with a smile, \"notes on gobbets need not be written in the manner of La Rochefoucauld. There isn\u0027t time.\" Peter, passing into the quadrangle, met Dundoon. He was in riding breeches. He lived in riding breeches, till they became for Peter a symbol of well-born inanity. Moreover, he was freely indulging his principal pleasure—namely, he was vigorously cracking a riding-whip, making the walls ring with snap after snap. \"Hullo,\" he said as Peter passed within careful distance. \"Idiot,\" muttered Peter between his teeth. \"Freshly roasted by the Wuggins—What?\" \"Dundoon, you\u0027re a damned nuisance. Put it away.\" [Pg 100] \"It\u0027s most important, Peter Pagger. It\u0027s most devilish important. M.F.H.—What?\" Dundoon cracked his whip rather more successfully than usual. The snap tingled in Peter\u0027s brain. In a fit of temper he sprang at Dundoon, and wrenched the whip from his hand. Dundoon looked at Peter\u0027s gleaming eyes as though he had seen the devil. \"What\u0027s this? In the name of Hell what is it?\" he said at last. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Peter with withering humility. \"Here is your whip.\" He handed it back to Dundoon, who took it cautiously. Peter moved away. But Dundoon arrested him. \"Peter Pagger,\" he said thoughtfully, \"do I understand that you\u0027ve been rude to me?\" \"As you please.\" \"Because you\u0027ll be ragged, that\u0027s all. You\u0027ll be jolly well ragged.\" The party of Dundoon was strolling up, and was invited to hear the news. \"Here, you fellows. Peter Pagger has been very rude to me. What shall we do to him? Peter Pagger has been roasted by the Wuggins for his naughty life in London. Third stocking from the right—What?\" Peter strode off boiling with anger. Dundoon belonged to a set which derived principally from a famous English school. It was a set traditionally opposed to the intellectuals;[Pg 101] indeed these two principal sets fed fat an ancient grudge. College humour mainly consisted at this time in the invention of scandalous histories by members of one set concerning members of the other. Needless to say the Paggers far excelled the Dundoons in the pith of their libels, so that the Dundoons had often to assert their supremacy in other ways. Upon one cold winter night, for example, the Paggers, one and all, retiring to rest had missed a necessary vessel. Thick snow covered the garden quadrangle, of which the Dundoons had built an immense mound upon the lawn. After three days a thaw set vigorously in, and the Junior Prior, looking from his window in the dawn, was shocked by an unutterable stack of College china mocking the doubtful virginity of the snow. The enterprises of the Dundoons were not subtle. The Junior Prior was not at this time happy. Quite recently he had himself been one of the Dundoons. He was a young professor of mathematics; and, because he was also an astronomer, they called him Peepy. He was brilliant on paper, but an admitted failure in dealing with the men. His discipline was openly flouted. Peter, who naturally did not know that the Junior Prior was an error of judgment, confessed by the authorities, regarded him, unfairly to Gamaliel, as typical of the place. He derided in him a wholly ineffectual and pedantic person whose dignity at Gamaliel reduced life to absurdity.[Pg 102] Peter was barely civil to the Junior Prior. It was characteristic of the Junior Prior that he tactlessly favoured the Dundoons. They used his pet name, and paraded with him linked in familiar conversation. Naturally, when his discipline fell upon men outside the set he favoured, it was bitterly resented. It was remembered, a fact unknown to the Fellows, that in the term before Peter came to Gamaliel the Junior Prior had been pushed downstairs by a robust man from the Colonies who, though he happened to be reading theology, was old enough to be the father of the Junior Prior, and had, it was believed, actually killed people somewhere in Mexico. The incident between Peter and Dundoon naturally splashed rather rudely into these College politics. Clearly it needed very little to raise a scandal. One of the Dundoons talked with Peter in the boat that afternoon, telling him that vengeance was intended, but Peter was wearily contemptuous. In the evening he sat peacefully at his window. To-day they had paddled far, passing through the locks to lower reaches of the river. Peter was tired and contemplative, his brain still rocking with the boat and filled with desolate echoes of shouting over lonely water. Big Tom was belling his hundred-and-one. The lawn was deserted and very quiet. Peter could recover distantly the rhythm of the town band. He remembered the night of his first [Pg 103]introduction to the dons of Gamaliel—the infinite promise that once had sounded in the Oxford bells. A riotous party broke into the far corner. Peter was not long in doubt as to who they were. Dundoon was cracking his whip. Peter sat still as they came irregularly towards him. \"Peter Pagger,\" said Dundoon, not quite certain of his syllables, \"we have come to rag you. Have you any objections?\" He stood below on the grass. He had been drinking and was very serious. \"None at all,\" said Peter indifferently. He looked down, as it were, on a group of animals. \"He hasn\u0027t any objections,\" said Dundoon confidentially to his supporters. \"Listen to me,\" he continued, addressing the open window. \"This is most important. You\u0027ve been very rude to me. What are you going to do about it?\" \"I\u0027m sitting here,\" said Peter. He heard them blundering up the wooden staircase. He might have sported a strong oak, locking them out until his friends had come together. But it hardly seemed worth while. He leaned upright by the open window, his hands in his pockets, as the Dundoons playfully rearranged the furniture. The etiquette on an occasion like this was simple. He must not make himself ridiculous by taking too seriously the frolic of men not entirely sober. Neither must he allow[Pg 104] himself to be insulted. Peter looked carelessly on, very calm but alert to decide when the joke had gone as far as the decorum of Gamaliel allowed. One of the Dundoons was arranging Peter\u0027s coal neatly upon the mantelpiece. Another was turning his pictures to the wall. His tablecloth and hearthrug were transposed. His wardrobe was assorted into heaps upon the floor and labelled for a sale by auction. Suddenly Peter saw that Dundoon was about to empty a water-jug into the bed. Peter passed swiftly towards him. \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll do that,\" he said. \"It would be nasty.\" \"You\u0027ve been very rude to me,\" said Dundoon, dangerously tilting the jug. Peter grasped him firmly by the arm and took the jug away. He put it back into the corner. Dundoon looked at Peter for a moment in drunken meditation. Then he put his hand on Peter\u0027s shoulder. \"Peter Pagger,\" he said, \"this is most important. Sorry to say—absolutely necessary to cleanse and purify unwholesome bed.\" And he walked to the corner. Peter followed him. \"Dundoon,\" he said sharply. Dundoon turned and found Peter at his elbow. Peter shook his fist under the nose of Dundoon. \"Pick up that water-jug and I\u0027ll punch your damned head.\" [Pg 105] \"Here, you fellows,\" shouted Dundoon. \"Come and hear what Peter Pagger is saying. He\u0027s been very rude to me.\" The Dundoons crowded into the little bedroom, and someone called: \"Take away his trousers!\" Peter stood back. There was an uproar and a movement towards him. \"Mind yourselves,\" he shouted. \"I\u0027m going to fight.\" There was a knock at the bedroom door, and silence fell suddenly. \"Come in,\" called Peter, not without relief. The Junior Prior stood in the doorway. He had heard an uproar in Peter\u0027s rooms, and he did not immediately see the company. \"Mr. Paragon,\" he said with the dignity of a sergeant, \"what\u0027s all this noise?\" He had got as far as this when Dundoon suddenly put a fond arm around his neck. \"It\u0027s all right, Peepy,\" he said. \"Peter Pagger\u0027s been very rude to me.\" The Junior Prior changed colour, and Peter enjoyed his confusion. The Junior Prior\u0027s attempt at discipline collapsed. He had come to assert his authority over a mere member of the college, but he had fallen among friends. \"Don\u0027t you think this has gone far enough?\" He almost pleaded with Dundoon. \"Peter Pagger\u0027s been very rude to me.\" \"Yes. But I think you ought to come away.\" \"But, Peepy, this is most important.\" [Pg 106] One of the Dundoons, more alive to the position than the rest, hastily pushed his leader from the room. Already the other men had discreetly vanished. \"What are you doing?\" Dundoon protested. \"Come out of it, you fool,\" whispered the man of tact. \"Don\u0027t you see you\u0027re making it awkward for Peepy?\" \"Awkward for Peepy?\" said Dundoon very audibly. \"Why is it awkward for Peepy?\" The Junior Prior went scarlet under Peter\u0027s dancing eyes. \"Your room seems to have suffered,\" he dimly smiled. \"I must look to Dundoon,\" and he dived hastily into the passage. Peter heard a sharp scuffle. He saw, in his mind\u0027s eye, the embarrassed man of authority forcing his tactless crony from sight and hearing. He flung up his hands in glee. The story did not lose in Peter\u0027s telling. Peter improved his description as the days went by. \"Awkward for Peepy,\" passed into the language. The Paggers, one and all, decided that it would be extremely awkward for Peepy if, after collapsing before Dundoon, he should ever again actively interfere with themselves.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2063/58746.html","bookId":535,"book":{"id":535,"title":"Peter Paragon","description":"简介： Peter might justly have complained that his birth was too calmly received.
