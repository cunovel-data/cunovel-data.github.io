{"id":21409,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"Peter sat stonily where Miranda left him earlier in the day. It was now quite dark, the evening primrose shining in tall clusters, very pale, within reach of his hand. Since a cab had jingled into hearing, stopped beside the house, and jingled away, hardly a sound had broken into his thoughts. Each rustle of the trees or lightest noise of the garden raised in him a riot of excitement; for he felt that Miranda would come, and he lived moment by moment intensely waiting. He was sure she would not be able to sleep without making her peace. \\n\\n \\n\\n Several times he moaned softly, and asked for her aloud. Once he was filled with bitterest anger, and started to go back into the house. He hated her. His brilliant future should not be linked with this rude and shabby girl. Then, in sharp remorse, he asked to be forgiven. Tears of self-pity had followed tears of anger and tears of utter pain, and had dried on his cheeks as he rigidly kept one posture on the narrow bench. He felt to-night that he had the power to experience and to utter all the sorrow of the world, and mixed with his pain there were sensations of the keenest luxury. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last a footstep sounded. He began to [Pg 59]tremble unendurably; but in the next instant he knew it was not Miranda. He had not recovered from his disappointment when his mother stood beside him. \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at her vaguely, not yet recalled from his raging thoughts. She called his name, and there was something in her voice that startled him. The moon which was now coming over the house poured its light upon her face. Swiftly Peter was aware of some terrible thing struggling for expression. His mother\u0027s eyes were clouded as though she was dazed from the effect of some hard and sudden blow. Her lips were drawn tight as though she suffered. She stood for a moment, and once or twice just failed to speak. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Peter,\" she said at last, \"I have to tell you something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter stared at her, quickly beginning to fear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be frightened, dear boy.\" Peter saw the first tears gather and fall. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mother, you are hurt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her tears now fell rapidly as she stooped and strained Peter towards her. She could not bear to see his face as she told him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Something terrible has happened. There has been a fight in the streets and father——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her arms tightened about him. Peter knew his father was dead. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We are alone, Peter,\" she said at last. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then she rose, and there were no more tears.[Pg 60] Erect in the moonlight, she seemed the statue of a mourning woman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is lying in our room, Peter. Won\u0027t you come?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter instinctively shuddered away. Then, feeling as though a weight had just been laid on him, he asked: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can I help you, mother? Is there anything to do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Uncle Henry is here. Come when you can.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter watched her move away towards the house. Self died outright in him as, filled with worship, he saw her, grave and beautiful, going to the dead man. \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon he wondered why, now that trouble had really come, he could not so easily be moved. The tears, which so readily had started from his eyes as he had brooded on his quarrel with Miranda, would not flow now for his father. His imagination could not at once accept reality. He sat as his mother had left him, sensible of a gradual ache that stole into his brain. Time passed; and, at last, as the ache became intolerable, he heard himself desperately repeating to himself the syllables: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never, Never.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He would never again see his father. Then his brain at last awoke in a vision of his father, an hour ago or so, confronting Mr. Smith. Peter\u0027s emotion first sprang alive in a sharp remorse. He had that evening found his father insufferable. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 61] \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter could no longer sit. He walked rapidly up and down the garden, giving rein to self-torment. He had always thought of his father, and now remembered him most vividly, as one who had read with him the books which first had opened his mind. His father shone now upon Peter crowned with all the hard, bright literature of revolt. \\n\\n \\n\\n A harsh cry suddenly broke up the silence of the garden. A newsboy ran shrieking a special edition, with headlines of riot and someone killed. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cry struck Peter motionless. He had realised so far that his father was dead. Now he remembered the riot. The newsboy had shouted of a charge of soldiers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Why had Peter not accepted his father\u0027s gospel? Why had he not stood that evening by his father\u0027s side? The enemies of whom his father had so often talked to Peter were real, and had struck him down. All the idle rhetoric that had slept unregarded in Peter\u0027s brain now rang like a challenge of trumpets. He saw his father as one who had tried to teach him a brave gospel of freedom, who had resisted tyranny, and died for his faith. \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter cursed the oppressor with clenched hands. In the tumble of his thoughts there intruded pictures, quite unconnected, of the life he had known at his first school—encounters with the friendly roughs, their common hatred of the police, the comfortable, oily embrace of the woman who had picked him from the snow. He felt now that he[Pg 62] was one of these struggling people, that he ought that night to have stood with his father. In contrast with the warm years in which he had gloried in the life of his humbler school his later comparative solitude coldly emphasized his kinship with the dispossessed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Scarcely twenty-four, hours ago Peter had feasted with the luxurious enemies of the poor. He had come from them, vainglorious and eager to claim their fellowship. For this he had been terribly punished. Peter felt the hand of God in all this. It seemed like destiny\u0027s reward for disloyalty to all his father had taught. \\n\\n \\n\\n He went into the house, and soon was looking at the dead man. His mother moved about the room, obeying her instinct to put all into keeping with the cold severity of that still figure. Peter looked and went rapidly away. He felt no tie of blood or affection. He was looking at death—at something immensely distant. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nevertheless, as he went from the oppressive house, this chill vision of death consecrated in his fancy the figure, legendary now, of a martyred prophet of revolt. By comparison he hardly felt his personal loss of a father. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he passed into the garden, he saw into the brilliantly lighted room next door. Mr. Smith sprawled with his head on the table, sobbing like a child. Peter, in a flash, remembered him as he had stood not two hours ago beside his father, shrilly repeating an hortation to shoot them down.[Pg 63] In that moment Peter had his first glimpse of the irony of life. He felt impulsively that he ought to comfort that foolish bowed figure whose babble had been so rudely answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, as Mr. Smith was seen to wipe his watery eyes with a spotted handkerchief, Peter grew impatient under that sting of absurdity which in life pricks the holiest sorrow. He turned sharply away, and in the path he saw Miranda. \\n\\n \\n\\n She put out her arm with a blind gesture to check the momentum of his recoil from the lighted window. He caught at her hand, but his fingers closed upon the rough serge of her sleeve. His passion leaped instantly to a climax. It was one of those rare moments when feeling must find pictured expression; when every barrier is down between emotion and its gesture. Miranda stood before him, the reproach of his disloyalty, a perfect figure of the life he must embrace. His hand upon her dress shot instantly into his brain a memory of that mean moment when he had nursed his wrongs upon her homeliness. A fierce contrition flung him without pose or premeditation on his knees beside her. As she leaned in wonder towards him, he caught the fringe of her frayed skirt in his hands, and, in a moment of supreme dedication, kissed it in a passion of worship. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2063/58740.html","bookId":535,"book":{"id":535,"title":"Peter Paragon","description":"简介： Peter might justly have complained that his birth was too calmly received.
