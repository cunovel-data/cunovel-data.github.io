{"id":21405,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"Peter in common daylight carefully examined his face in the looking-glass. His left eye was a painter\u0027s palette. He ruefully remembered that the fight had yet to be finished. He was bound to offer his adversary an opportunity of completing the good work, and he distinctly quailed. Peter was this morning upon solid earth. The crisis was past. He knew now that he had quickly to be a man, to get knowledge and wealth and power. \n \n Boys at Peter\u0027s branch of the foundation of King Edward VI could no higher ascend into knowledge than the binomial theorem. Peter, not yet fifteen, was already head of the school—the favourite pupil of his masters, easily leading in learning and cricket. Already it was a question whether he should or should not proceed to the High School where Greek and the Calculus were to be had. \n \n Peter\u0027s career was already a problem. Mr. Paragon inclined to believe that the best thing for a boy of fifteen was to turn into business, leaving Greek to the parsons. Mrs. Paragon had different views. Peter was yet unaware of this discussion, nor had he wondered what would happen when the time came for leaving his first school. \n \n Peter\u0027s company raised a chorus when they [Pg 32]beheld him. They explained to Peter what his face was like. They were proud of it. A terrible and bloody fellow was their captain. \n \n When Peter met his adversary each noted with pleasure that the other was honourably marked. \n \n The handsome rough thrust out a large red hand. \n \n \"Take it or leave it,\" he said. \n \n Peter took it. The bells were calling in a final burst, and he passed rapidly on with his company. It was peace with honour. \n \n Peter was in a resolute grapple with the binomial theorem when a call came for him to go into the headmaster\u0027s room. Peter, delicately feeling his battered face, followed the school-porter with misgiving. \n \n \"Paragon,\" said the headmaster, \"I don\u0027t like your face. It isn\u0027t respectable.\" \n \n Peter writhed softly, aware that he was ironically contemplated. \n \n \"This fighting in the streets,\" continued the headmaster, \"is becoming a public nuisance. I should be sorry to believe that any of our boys provoked it. I hope it was self-defence.\" \n \n \"Mostly, sir,\" said Peter. \n \n \"I rely upon you, Paragon, to avoid making the school a nuisance to the parish.\" \n \n \"I realise my responsibility, sir.\" \n \n Peter was quite serious, and the headmaster did not smile. \n \n \"Now, Paragon,\" he said, \"I want to talk to[Pg 33] you about something else. I have just written to your father. Do you know what you would like to do when you leave school?\" \n \n \"No, sir,\" said Peter. \n \n Peter had, in fancy, invented posts for himself that would tax to the fullest extent his complicated genius. He had lived a hundred lives. Nevertheless, bluntly asked whether he had thought about his future, he as bluntly answered \"No,\" and knew in a moment that the answer was dreadfully true. His cloud cuckooland of battle and success, magnificent with pictures of himself in all the great attitudes of history, vanished at a simple question. He was rapidly growing old. \n \n The headmaster continued, pitilessly sensible. \n \n \"I want you to go on with your education,\" he said. \"You have done very well with us here. I have written to your father urging him to send you to the High School where it will be possible for you to qualify for the University. I want you, before you see your father, to make up your mind what you want to do.\" \n \n Peter left the headmaster\u0027s room with a sense of loss. The glamour had gone out of life. His future, vast and uncertain, had in a moment narrowed to a practical issue. Should he go on to another school, or into some office of the town? These were dreary alternatives. Already he was fifteen years old, and he had somehow to be the most famous man in the world within the next five years. \n \n [Pg 34] \n \n Peter\u0027s father went that day to visit his brother-in-law. \n \n Henry Prout, Peter\u0027s uncle and godfather, had at this time retired from the retailing of hardware. He was wealthy, an alderman of the town, and a bachelor. He took a father\u0027s interest in his nephew. There was a tacit, very indefinite assumption that in all which nearly concerned his sister\u0027s son Henry had a right to be consulted. \n \n When Peter heard his father had gone round to his uncle\u0027s house he knew his career was that evening to be decided. \n \n Henry Prout was a copy in gross of his sister. Mrs. Paragon was queenly and fair. Henry was large and florid. Mrs. Paragon was amiable and full of peace. Henry was genial and lazy. Mrs. Paragon equably accepted life from a naturally perfect balance of character, Henry from a naturally perfect confidence in the inclinations of his rosy and abundant flesh. \n \n Uncle Henry had one large regret. He had had no education, and he greatly envied the people who had. His admiration for the results of education was really a part of his indolence. He admired the readiness and ease with which educated people disposed of problems which cost him painful efforts of the brain. Education was for Uncle Henry a royal way to the settlement of every difficult thing. If you had education, life was an arm-chair. If you had it not, life was a[Pg 35] necessity to think things laboriously out for yourself. \n \n Uncle Henry had made up his mind that Peter should have the best education money could buy. Peter, he determined, should learn Greek. \n \n \"Well, George,\" he said in his comfortable thick voice, \"what\u0027s it going to be?\" \n \n He was not yet alluding to Peter\u0027s career, but to some bottles on the little table between them. \n \n \"Half and half,\" said George. \n \n \"Help yourself,\" said Henry, adding, as Mr. Paragon portioned out his whisky, \"How\u0027s sister?\" \n \n \"Up to the mark every time.\" \n \n \"She\u0027s all right. There\u0027s not a more healthy woman in England than sister.\" \n \n Henry paused a little in reflection upon the virtues of Mrs. Paragon. He then continued. \n \n \"How\u0027s the boy?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll tell you what,\" said Mr. Paragon, \"he\u0027s growing up.\" \n \n \"Fifteen next December.\" \n \n \"Old for his age,\" said Mr. Paragon, nodding between the lines. \n \n Uncle Henry thoughtfully compressed his lips. \n \n \"Well,\" he said, \"I suppose the boy will have to find out what he\u0027s made of.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s very thick next door,\" suggested Mr. Paragon with a meaning eye. \n \n \"I\u0027ve noticed her, George. She\u0027ll soon be finding out a thing or two for herself.\" \n \n [Pg 36] \n \n \"There\u0027s a handsome woman there,\" said Mr. Paragon. \n \n \"Well enough.\" \n \n They paused again in contemplation of possibilities in Miranda. \n \n \"I\u0027ve had a letter,\" said Mr. Paragon at last. The headmaster\u0027s sheet was handed over, and carefully deciphered. \n \n \"Writes a shocking hand,\" said Uncle Henry. \"That\u0027s education. Peter\u0027s hand,\" he added contentedly, \"is worse. I can\u0027t make head or tail of what Peter writes.\" \n \n Henry mixed himself another whisky. \"They seem to think a great lot of him,\" he said thoughtfully. \"That about the Scholarships, for instance. They say he\u0027ll get the ￡30. Then he goes to the High School and gets ￡50, and ￡80 at the University. Think of that, George.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t hold with it,\" Mr. Paragon broke out. \n \n \"Education,\" Henry began. \n \n \"Education yourself,\" interrupted Mr. Paragon. \"What\u0027s the good of all that second-hand stuff?\" \n \n \"It helps.\" \n \n \"Yes. It helps to make a nob of my son. It\u0027s little he\u0027ll learn at the University except to take off his hat to people no better than himself.\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t you trust him?\" \n \n \"Peter\u0027s all right,\" Mr. Paragon jealously admitted. \n \n \"There\u0027s no harm in a bit of Greek. You talk[Pg 37] as if it was going to turn him straight off into a bishop.\" \n \n Uncle Henry paused, and, desiring to make a point, took the hearthrug. \n \n \"I can\u0027t understand you,\" he continued, with legs well apart. \"If Peter is going to have my money, he\u0027s got to learn how to spend it. Look at myself. I have had sense to make a bit of money, but I\u0027ve got no more idea of spending it than a baby. I want Peter to learn.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s all right,\" said Mr. Paragon. \"But what\u0027s going to happen to Peter when he gets into the hands of a lot of doctors?\" \n \n \"Peter must take his chance.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s well for you to talk. You\u0027re as blue as they\u0027re made, and a churchwarden of the parish.\" \n \n Uncle Henry solemnly put down his glass. \"George,\" he said, \"it does not matter to a mortal fool what I am, nor what you are. Peter\u0027s got to find things out for himself. He\u0027ll get past you and me; and, whether he comes out your side or mine, he\u0027ll have more in his head.\" \n \n Uncle Henry ended with an air of having closed the discussion, and, after some friendly meditation, whose results were flung out in the fashion of men too used to each other\u0027s habit of thought to need elaborate intercourse, Mr. Paragon rose and went thoughtfully home. \n \n By the time he reached the Kidderminster Road he had definitely settled the question of Peter\u0027s career. Peter should get knowledge. He should[Pg 38] possess the inner fortress of learning. He should be the perfect knight of the oppressed people, armed at all points. Thus did Mr. Paragon reconcile his Radical prejudices with his fatherly ambition. \n \n Arrived home, he showed the headmaster\u0027s letter to Mrs. Paragon. \n \n She read it with the pride of a mother who knows the worth of her boy, but nevertheless likes it to be acknowledged. \n \n Mr. Paragon watched her as she read. \n \n \"Yes,\" he said, answering her thoughts, \"Peter\u0027s all right.\" \n \n Mrs. Paragon handed back the letter. \n \n \"I suppose,\" suggested Mr. Paragon, airily magnificent, \"he had better go on with his education?\" \n \n \"Of course,\" said Mrs. Paragon. \n \n Mr. Paragon knew at once that if he had persisted in taking Peter from school he would have had to persuade his wife that it was right to do so. He also knew that this would have been very difficult. \n \n Fortunately, however, he had decided otherwise. He could flatter himself now that he had settled this grave question himself. It was true, in a sense, that he had. Mr. Paragon had not for nothing lived with his wife for nearly seventeen years. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2063/58736.html","bookId":535,"book":{"id":535,"title":"Peter Paragon","description":"简介： Peter might justly have complained that his birth was too calmly received.
