{"id":10657,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. FORS L\u0027AMOUR.","content":"Though it was not des Ageaux\u0027 fate to lie in one of those underground dungeons, noisome and dark, which the lords of an earlier century had provided in the foundations of the castle, he was not greatly the better for the immunity. The humiliations of the mind are sometimes sharper than the pains of the body; and the Lieutenant of Périgord, defeated and a prisoner, was little the happier though a dry strong-room looking on a tiny inner court held him, and though he suffered nothing from cold or the slimy companionship of the newt and frog. On the ambitious man defeat sits more heavily than chains; into the nature that would fain be at work inaction gnaws deeper than a shackle-bolt. Never while he lived would des Ageaux forget the long hours which he spent, gazing drearily on the blank wall that faced his window, while his mind measured a hundred times over the depth and the completeness of his fall. \n \n He feared little for his life if he deigned to fear at all. He knew that he was a prize too valuable to be wasted. In the last resort, indeed, when all hopes had failed the Captain of Vlaye, and ruin stared him in the face, he might wreak his vengeance on the King\u0027s governor. But short of that moment--and it depended upon many things--the Lieutenant accounted himself safe. Safe as to life, but a beaten man, a prisoner, a failure; a blot, every moment he lay there, on the King\u0027s dignity, whose deputy he was; an unfortunate, whose ill hap would never be forgiven by the powers he had represented so ill. \n \n The misfortune was great, and, to a proud man, well-nigh intolerable. Moreover, this man was so formed that he loved the order which it was his mission to extend, and the good government which it was his to impose. To make straight the crooked--gently, if it might be, but by the strong hand if it must be--was his part in life, and one which he pursued with the utmost zest. Every breach of order, therefore, every trespass in his province, every outrage wounded him. But the breach and the trespass which abased in his person the King\u0027s name--he writhed, he groaned as he thought of this! Even the blow to his career, fatal as it promised to be, scarce hurt him worse or cut him so deeply. \n \n The more as that career which had been all in all to him yesterday was not quite all in all to him to-day. Bonne\u0027s voice, the touch of her hands as she appealed to him, the contact of her figure with his as he carried her, these haunted him, and moved him, in his solitude and his humiliation. Her courage, her constancy, her appeal to him, when all seemed lost, he could not think of them--he who had thought of naught but himself for years--without a softening of his features, without a flood of colour invading the darkness of his face. Strong, he had estranged himself from the tender emotions, only to own their sway now. With half his mind he dwelt upon his mishap; the other half, the better half, found consolation in the prospect of her sympathy, of her fidelity, of her gentle eyes and quivering lips--who loved him. He found it strange to remember that he filled all a woman\u0027s thoughts; that, as he sat there brooding in his prison, she was thinking of him and dreaming of him, and perhaps praying for him! \n \n It is not gladly, it is never without a pang that the man of affairs sees the world pass from him. And if there be nothing left, it is bad for him. Des Ageaux acknowledged that he had something left. A hand he could trust would lie in his, and one brave heart, when all others forsook him would accompany him whither he went. He might no longer aspire to government and the rule of men, the work of his life was over; but Bonne would hold to him none the less, would love him none the less, would believe in him truly. The cares of power would no longer trouble his head, or keep it sleepless; but her gentle breast would pillow it, her smiles would comfort him, her company replace the knot of followers to whom he had become accustomed. He told himself that he was content. He more than half believed it. \n \n In the present, however, he had not her company; and the present was very miserable. He did not fear for his life, but he lay in ignorance of all that had happened since his capture, of all that went forward; and the tedium of imprisonment tried him. He knew that he might lie there weeks and months and come forth at last--for the world moved quickly in this period of transition--to find himself forgotten. Seventy years earlier, a king, misnamed the Great, standing where he stood, had said that all was lost but honour--and had hastened to throw that also away. For him all was lost but love. All! \n \n He had passed four days--they seemed to him a fortnight--in this weary inaction, and on the last evening of the four he was expecting his supper with impatience, when it occurred to him that the place was more noisy than ordinary. For some time sounds had reached him without making any definite impression on his mind; now they resolved themselves into echoes of distant merry-making. Little spirts of laughter, the catch of a drinking-song, the shrill squeal of a maid pinched or kissed, the lilt of a hautboy--he began with quickened ears to make these out. And straightway that notion which is never out of a prisoner\u0027s mind and which the least departure from routine fosters raised its head. Escape! Ah, if he could escape! Freedom would set him where he had been, freedom would undo the worst of his mishap. It might even give him the victory he had counted lost. \n \n But the grated window or the barred door, the paved floor or the oaken roof--one of these must be pierced; or the gaoler, who never visited him without precautions and company, must be overcome and robbed of his keys. And even then, with that done which was well-nigh impossible, he would be little nearer to freedom than before. He would be still in the heart of his enemy\u0027s fortress, with no knowledge of the passages or the turnings, no clue to the stone labyrinth about him, no accomplice. \n \n Yet, beyond doubt, there was merry-making afoot--such merry-making as accounted for the tarrying of his supper. Probably the man had forgotten him. By-and-by the notes of the hautboy rose louder and fuller, and on the wave of sound bursts of applause and laughter came to him. He made up his mind that some were dancing and others were looking on and encouraging them. Could it be that the Captain of Vlaye had surprised the peasants\u0027 camp? and that this was his way of celebrating his success? Or was it merely some common-place orgie, held, it might be, in the Captain\u0027s absence? Or---- But while he turned this and that in his thoughts the footsteps he had been expecting sounded at the end of the stone passage and approached. A light shone under the door, a key turned in the lock, and the man who brought him his meals appeared on the threshold. He entered, his hands full, while his comrade, who had opened for him, remained in the passage. \n \n \"You are gay this evening?\" the Lieutenant said as the man set down his light. \n \n The fellow grinned. \"Ay, my lord,\" he replied good-humouredly, \"you may say it. Wedding-bells and the rest of it!\" He was not drunk, but he was flushed with wine. \"That is the way the world goes--and comes.\" \n \n \"A wedding?\" des Ageaux exclaimed. The news was strange. \n \n \"To be sure, my lord. \n \n \u0027En revenant des noces, \n Barabim!\u0027\" \n \n he hummed. \n \n \"And whose, my man?\" \n \n The fellow, in the act of putting a bowl of soup on the table, held his hand. He looked at the Lieutenant with a grin. \"Ay, whose?\" he said. \"But that would be talking. And we have orders not to talk, see you, my lord. Still, it is not many you\u0027ll have the chance of telling. And, if I tell you it is the Captain himself, what matter? Should we be footing it and drinking it and the rest for another?\" \n \n \"M. de Vlaye married?\" des Ageaux exclaimed in astonishment. \"To-day?\" \n \n \"Married for sure, and as tight as Father Benet could marry him! But to-day\"--with his head on one side--\"that is another matter.\" \n \n \"And the bride?\" \n \n \"Ay, that is another matter, tool\" with a wink. \"Not that you can let it out to many either! So, if you must know----\" \n \n \"Best not,\" intervened his comrade in the passage, speaking for the first time. \n \n \"Perhaps you do not know yourself?\" the Lieutenant said shrewdly. He saw that the man was sufficiently in drink to be imprudent. With a little provocation he would tell. \n \n \"Not know?\"--with indignation. \"Didn\u0027t I----\" \n \n \"Know or not, don\u0027t tell!\" growled the other. \n \n \"Of course,\" said des Ageaux, \"if you don\u0027t know you cannot tell.\" \n \n \"Oh!\" the fool rejoined. \"Cannot I? Well, I can tell you it is Mademoiselle de Villeneuve. So there\u0027s for knowing!\" \n \n Des Ageaux sprang to his feet, his face transformed. \"What!\" he cried. \"Say that again!\" \n \n But his excitement overreached itself. His movement warned the other that he had spoken too freely. With an uneasy look--what had he done?--he refused to say more, and backed to the door. \"I have said too much already,\" he muttered sullenly. \n \n \"But----\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t answer him!\" commanded the man in the passage. \"And hurry! You have stayed too long as it is! I would not be in your shoes for something if the Captain comes to know.\" \n \n Des Ageaux stepped forward, pressing him again to speak. But the man, sobered and frightened, was obdurate. \"I\u0027ve said too much already,\" he answered with a resentful scowl. \"What is it to you, my lord?\" And he slipped out hurriedly, and secured the door behind him. \n \n Des Ageaux remained glaring at the closed door. Bonne de Villeneuve had been taken with him. Bonne de Villeneuve also was a prisoner. Was it possible that she had become by force or willingly Vlaye\u0027s bride? Possible? Ah, God, it must be so! And, if so, by force surely! Surely, by force; his faith in her told him that! But if by force, what consolation could he draw from that? For that, if he loved her, were worst of all, most cruel of all! That were a thing intolerable by God or man! \n \n So it seemed to this man, who only a few days before had not known what love was. But who now, stung with sudden passion, flung himself from wall to wall of his narrow prison. Now, when he saw it snatched from him, now, when he saw himself denuded of that solace at which he had grasped, but for which he had not been sufficiently thankful, now he learned what love was, its pains as well as its promise, its burning fevers, its heart-stabbing pity! He lost himself in rage. He who for years had practised himself in calmness, who had made it his aim to hide his heart, forgot his lesson, flung to the night his habit. He seized the iron bars of his window and shook them in a paroxysm of fury, as if only by violence he could retain his sanity. When the bars, which would have resisted the strength of ten, declined to leave the stone, he flung himself on the door, and beat on it and shouted, maddened by the thought that she was under the same roof, that she was within call, yet he could not help her! He called Vlaye by dreadful names, challenging him, and defying him, and promising him terrible deaths. And only when echo and silence answered all and the iron sense of his helplessness settled down slowly upon him and numbed his faculties did he, too, fall silent and, covering his face with his hands, stagger to a seat and sit in a stupor of despair. \n \n He had put love aside, he had despised it through years--for this! He had held it cheap when it promised to be his--for this! He had accepted it grudgingly, and when all else was like to fail him--for this! He was punished, and sorely. She was near him. He pictured her in the man\u0027s power, in the man\u0027s hands, in the man\u0027s arms! And he could not help her. \n \n Had his impotent cries and threats been heard they had only covered him with humiliation. Fortunately they were not heard: the merry-making was at its height, and no one came near him. The Captain of Vlaye, aware that his marriage could not be hidden from his own men--for he had made no secret of it beforehand--had not ventured to forbid some indulgence. He could make it known that the man who named his bride outside the gate would lose his tongue; but, that arranged, he must wink--for every despotism is tempered by something--at a few hours of riot, and affect not to see things that at another time had called for swift retribution. \n \n The men had used his permission to the full. They had brought in some gipsies to make sport for them, a treble allowance of wine was on draught, and the hour that saw des Ageaux beating in impotent fury on his door saw the license and uproar of which he had marked the beginning grown to a head. In the great hall the higher officers, their banquet finished, were deep in their cups. In the cavernous kitchens drunken cooks probed cauldrons for the stray capon that still floated amid the spume; or half-naked scullions thrust a forgotten duck or widgeon on the spit at the request of a hungry friend. About the fires in the courtyard were dancing and singing and some romping; for there were women within the walls, and others had come in with the gipsies. Here a crowd surrounded the bear, and laid furious bets for or against; while yelps and growls and fierce barkings deafened all within hearing. There a girl, the centre of a leering ring, danced to the music of her tambour; and there again a lad tumbled, and climbed a pole at risk of his limbs. Everywhere, save in the dark garden under the \"demoiselle\u0027s\" windows, where a sentry walked, and at the great gates, where were some sober men picked for the purpose, wantonness and jollity held reign, and the noise of brawling and riot cast fear on the town that listened and quaked below. \n \n A stranger entering the castle would have judged the reins quite fallen, all discipline fled, all control lost. But he had been wrong. Not only did a sentry walk the garden path--and soberly and shrewdly too--but no man in his wildest and tipsiest moment ventured a foot within the railing that fenced the lime avenue, or even approached the gates that led to it without lowering his voice and returning to something like his normal state. For in the rooms looking over the garden M. de Vlaye entertained his bride of two days--and he had relaxed, not loosed, the reins. \n \n They sat supping in the room in which they had been wedded, and, unmoved by the sounds of uproar that came fitfully to their ears, discussed their plans; she, glowing and handsome, animated by present love and future hope; he, content, if not enraptured, conquered by her wit, and almost persuaded that all was for the best--that her charms and beauty would secure him more than the dowry of her rival. Their brief honeymoon over, they were to part on the morrow; she to pursue her plans for the Duke\u0027s detachment, he to take the field and strike such a blow as should scatter the peasants and dissipate what strength remained in them. They were to part; and some shadow of the coming separation had been natural. But her nerves as well as his were strong, and the gloom of parting had not yet fallen on them. The lights that filled the room were not brighter than her eyes; the snowy linen that covered the round table at which they sat was not whiter than her uncovered shoulders. He had given her jewels, the spoils of many an enterprise; and they glittered on her queenly neck and in her ears, gleamed through the thin lace of her dress, and on her round and beautiful arms. He called her his Abbess and his nun in fond derision; and she, in answering badinage, rallied him on his passion for the Countess and his skill in abduction. So cleverly had she wrought on him, so well managed him, that she dared even that. \n \n The room had been hung for her with tapestries brought from another part of the house; the windows more richly curtained; and a door, long closed, had been opened, through which and an ante-room the chambers connected with M. de Vlaye\u0027s apartments. Where the wedding robes had lain on the window-seat a ribboned lute and a gay music-book lay on rich draperies, and elbowed a gilded head-piece of Milanese work surmounted by M. de Vlaye\u0027s crest, which had been brought in for his lady\u0027s approval. A mighty jar of Provence roses scented the apartment; and intoxicated by their perfume or their meaning, she presently seized the lute, and gaily, between jest and earnest, broke into the old Angoumois song:-- \n \n \"Si je suis renfermée. \n Ah, c\u0027est bien sans raison; \n Ma plus belle journée, \n Se pass\u0027ra-z-en prison. \n Mais mon amant sans peine \n Pourra m\u0027y venir voir, \n Son c?ur sait bien qu\u0027il m\u0027aime, \n Il viendra\u0027-z-au parloir!\" \n \n And he answered her-- \n \n \"Oh, Madame l\u0027Abbesse, \n Qu\u0027on tire les verrous, \n Qu\u0027on sorte ma ma?tresse \n Le plus beau des bijoux; \n Car je suis capitaine, \n Je suis son cher amant, \n J\u0027enfoncerai sans peine \n Les portes du couvent!\" \n \n As he finished, disturbed by some noise, he turned his head. \"I told your wench to go,\" he said, rising. \"I suppose she took herself off?\" With a frown, he strode to the screen that masked the door, and made sure by looking behind it that they had no listeners. \n \n She smiled as she laid aside the lute. \"I thought that your people obeyed at a word?\" she said. \n \n \"They do, or they suffer,\" he answered. \n \n \"And is that to apply to me?\" with a mocking grimace. \n \n \"When we come to have two wills, sweet, yes!\" he retorted. \"It will not be yet awhile. In the meantime I would this enterprise of yours were over. I doubt your success, though all looks well.\" \n \n \"If I had been half as sure of you two days ago as I am of him to-morrow!\" she retorted. \n \n \"Yet you must not go too far with him.\" \n \n She waved her finger-tips across the table. \"So far, and no farther,\" she said lightly. \"Have I not promised you? For the rest--what I have done I can do. Am I not armed?\" And she rose from her seat, and stood before him in all the seduction of her charms. \"Count it done, my master. Set Joyeuse aside. He is captive of my bow and spear. The question is, can you deal with the rest?\" \n \n \"The peasants?\" \n \n \"And what remains of des Ageaux\u0027 power? And the Countess\u0027s levies?\" \n \n \"For certain, if the Duke be out of the reckoning,\" he answered. \"He is a man. Remove him and des Ageaux--and the latter I have already--and there is no one. Your brothers----\" \n \n \"Bah!\" She dismissed them with a contemptuous gesture. \n \n \"Just so. And the Countess\u0027s people have no leader. The Vicomte is old. There is no one. Detach the Duke, and there will be a speedy end of them. And before a new governor can set to work to make head against me, many things may happen, my girl!\" \n \n \"Many things will happen,\" she answered with confidence. \"If I can win one man, why not another? If a Duke, why not\"--she made an extraordinary face at him, half-sportive, half-serious--\"why not a greater? Eh, my lord?\" \n \n He stared. \"No!\" he answered, striking the table with sudden violence. \"No!\" He knew well what she meant and whom she meant. \"Not that! Even to make all good, not that!\" Yet his eyes glittered as he looked at her; and it was plain that his thoughts travelled far and fast on the wings of her words. While she, in the pride of her mastery, returned his look fondly. \n \n \"No, not that--never that!\" she replied in a voice that more than reassured him. \"It is for you and only for you that I do this. I am yours, all and always--always! But, short of that, something may be done. And, with friends at Court, from Captain of Vlaye to Governor of Périgord is but a step!\" \n \n He nodded. \"And a step that might save his Majesty much trouble,\" he said with a smile. \"Do that---- But I doubt your power, my girl.\" \n \n \"I have done that already should persuade you.\" \n \n \"You have tricked me,\" he said, smiling. \"That is true. And it is no mean thing, I grant.\" \n \n \"More than that!\" she retorted. The wine she had drunk had flushed her cheek and perhaps loosed her tongue. \"More than that I have done! Who took the first step for you? Who put the Lieutenant in your hands--and my sister? And so, in place of my sister, the Countess?\" \n \n He looked at her in astonishment. \"Who?\" he rejoined. \"Why, who but I myself? Did I not take them with my own hands--at the old windmill on the hill? What had you to do with that?\" \n \n \"And who sent them to the windmill?\" \n \n \"Why, the rabble to be sure, who seized them, took them as far as the ford.\" \n \n \"And who set the rabble on them?\" As she asked the question she rose from her seat. In the excitement of her triumph, in the intoxication of her desire to please him she forgot the despair into which the act which she boasted had cast her but a week before. She forgot all except that she had done it for him whom she loved, for him who now was hers, and whose she was! \"Who,\" she repeated, \"set the rabble upon them?\" \n \n \"You?\" he murmured. \"Not you?\" \n \n \"I!\" she said, \"I!\"--and held out her hands to him. \"It was I who told the brute beasts that he--des Ageaux--had your man in hiding! It was I who wrought them to the attempt and listened while they did it! I thought, indeed, that it was your Countess who was with him. And I hated her! I was jealous of her! But, Countess or no Countess, \u0027twas done by me!--by me! And now do you think that there is anything I will not do for you? That there is anything I cannot do for you?\" \n \n He was not shocked; it took much to shock the Captain of Vlaye. But he was so much astonished, he marvelled so much that he was silent. And she, reading the astonishment in his face, and seeing it grow, felt a qualm--now she had spoken--and lost colour, and faltered. Had she been foolish to tell it? Perhaps. Had she passed some boundary, sacred to him, unknown to her? It must be so. For as she gazed, no word spoken, there came into his face a change, a strange hardening. He rose. \n \n \"My lord!\" she cried, clapping her hands to her head, \"what have I done?\" She recoiled a pace, affrighted. \"I did it for you!\" \n \n \"Some one has heard you,\" he answered between his teeth. And then she saw that he was looking not at her, but beyond her--beyond her. \"There is some one behind that screen.\" \n \n She faced about, affrighted, and instinctively seized his arm and hung on it, her eyes on the screen. Her attitude as she listened, and her pallor, were in strange contrast with the gay glitter of the table, the lights, the luxury, the fairness of her dress. \n \n \"Yes, listening,\" he said grimly. \"Some one has been listening. The worse for them! For they will never tell what they have heard!\" \n \n And bounding forward without warning, he dashed the screen down and aside--and recoiled. Face to face with him, cowering against the doorpost, and pale as ashes, was the very man she had mentioned a minute before--that very man of his whose hidden presence in the camp she had betrayed to the malcontents. Vlaye glared at him. \"You!\" he cried. \"You!\" \n \n \"My lord!\" \n \n \"And listening!\" \n \n \"But----\" \n \n \"But! But die, fool!\" the Captain retorted savagely. \"Die!\" And, swift as speech, the dagger he had stealthily drawn gleamed above his shoulder and sank in the poor wretch\u0027s throat. \n \n The man\u0027s hands groped in the air, his eyes opened wide; but he attempted no return-stroke. Choked by the life-stream that gushed from his mouth, he sank back inert like a bundle of clothes, while the Abbess\u0027s low shriek of terror mingled with his stifled cry. \n \n And, with a sterner sound, another sound. For as the man collapsed, and fell in on himself, a figure hitherto hidden in the doorway sprang over his falling body, a long blade flashed in the candle-light, and the Captain of Vlaye staggered back, one hand pressed to his breast. He made a futile attempt to ward with his poniard, but it fell from his grasp. And the pitiless steel found his heart again. Silent, grim, with unquenchable hate in his eyes, he reeled against the table. And then from the table, dragging with him all--silver and glass and fruit--in one common crash, he rolled to the floor--dying. \n \n Ay, in five seconds, dead! And she saw it with her eyes! Saw it! And frozen, stiff, clinging to the bare edge of the table, she stood looking at him, her brain numbed by the horror, by the suddenness, the hopelessness of the catastrophe. In a twinkling, in a time measured by seconds, it was done. The olives that fell from the dish had not ceased to roll, the wine still crept upon the floor, the man who had struck the blow still panted, his point delivered--but he was dead whom she had loved. Dead! \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1494/44672.html","bookId":1320,"book":{"id":1320,"title":"Abbess Of Vlaye","description":"简介： Monsieur des Ageaux was a man of whom his best friends could not say that he shone, or tried to shine, in the pursuit of the fair sex.
