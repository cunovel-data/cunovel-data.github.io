{"id":10642,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX. SPEEDY JUSTICE.","content":"The elder of the Villeneuve brothers was less happy than Roger, in that the Vicomte had passed to him a portion of his crabbed nature. Something of the bitterness, something of the hardness of the father lurked in the son; who in the like unfortunate circumstances might have grown to be such another as his sire, but with more happy surroundings and a better fate still had it in him to become a generous and kindly gentleman. \n \n It was this latent crabbedness that had kept the injustice of his lot ever before his gaze. Roger bore lightly with his heavier burden, and only the patient sweetness of his eyes told tales. Bonne was almost content; if she fretted it was for others, and if she dreamed of the ancient glories of the house, it was not for the stiff brocades and jewelled stomacher of her grandame that she pined. \n \n But with Charles it was otherwise. The honour of the family was more to him, for he was the heir. Its dignity and welfare were his in a particular sense; and had he been of the most easy disposition, he must still have found it hard to see all passing; to see the end, and to stand by with folded arms. But when to the misery of inaction and the hopelessness of the outlook were added the Vicomte\u0027s daily and hourly taunts, and all fell on a nature that had in it the seeds of unhappiness, what wonder if the young man broke away and sought in action, however desperate, a remedy for his pains? \n \n A step which he would now have given the world to undo. As he rode a prisoner along the familiar track, which he had trodden a thousand times in freedom and safety, the iron entered into his soul. The sun shone, the glades were green, in a hundred brakes the birds sang, in shady dells and under oaks the dew sparkled; but he rode, his feet fastened under his horse\u0027s belly, his face set towards Vlaye. In an hour the dungeon door would close on him. He would have given the world, had it been his, to undo the step. \n \n Not that he feared the dungeon so much, or even death; though the thought of death, amid the woodland beauty of this June day, carried a chill all its own, and death comes cold to him who awaits it with tied hands. But he could have faced death cheerfully--or he thought so--had he fallen into a stranger\u0027s power; had the victory not been so immediately, so easily, so completely with Vlaye--whom he hated. To be dragged thus before his foe, to read in that sneering face the contempt which events had justified, to lie at his mercy who had treated him as a silly clownish lad, to be subjected, may-be, to some contemptuous degrading punishment--this was a prospect worse than death, a prospect maddening, insupportable! Therefore he looked on the woodland with eyes of despair, and now and again, in fits of revolt, had much ado not to fight with his bonds, or hurl unmanly insults at his captors. \n \n They, for their part, took little heed of him. They had not bound his hands, but had tied the reins of his horse to one of their saddles, and, satisfied with this precaution, they left him to his reflections. By-and-by those reflections turned, as the thoughts of all captives turn, to the chance of escape; and he marked that the men--they numbered five--seemed to be occupied with something which interested them more than their prisoner. What it was, of what nature or kind, he had no notion; but he observed that as surely as they recalled their duty and drew round him, so surely did the lapse of two or three minutes find them dispersed again in pairs--it might be behind, it might be before him. \n \n When this happened they talked low, but with an absorption so entire that once he saw a man jam his knee against a sapling which he failed to see, though it stood in his path; and once a man\u0027s hat was struck from his head by a bough which he might have avoided by stooping. \n \n Naturally the trooper to whose saddle he was attached had no part in these conferences. And by-and-by this man, a grizzled, thick-set fellow with small eyes, grew impatient, and even, it seemed, suspicious. For a time he vented his dissatisfaction in grunts and looks, but at last, when the four others had got together and were colloguing with heads so close that a saddle-cloth would have covered them, he could bear it no longer. \n \n \"Come, enough of that!\" he cried surlily. \"One of you take him, and let me hear what you have settled. I\u0027d like my say as well as another.\" \n \n \"Ay, ay, Baptist,\" one of the four answered. \"In a minute, my lad.\" \n \n Baptist swore under his breath. Still he waited, and by-and-by one of the men came grudgingly back, took over the prisoner, and suffered Baptist to join the council. But Villeneuve, whose attention was now roused, noted that this man also, after an interval, became restless. He watched his comrades with jealous eyes, and from time to time he pressed nearer, as if he would fain surprise their talk. Things were in this position when the party arrived at a brook, bordered on either side by willow beds and rushes, and passable at a tiny ford. Beyond the brook the hill rose suddenly and steeply. Charles knew the place as he knew his hand, and that from the brook the track wound up through the brushwood to a nick in the summit of the hill, whence Vlaye could be seen a league below. \n \n The four troopers paused at the ford, and letting their horses drink, permitted the prisoner and his guard to come up. The man they called Baptist approached the latter. \"If you will wait here,\" he said, with a look of meaning, \"we\u0027ll look to the--you know what.\" \n \n \"I? No, cursed if I do!\" the man answered plumply, his swarthy face growing dark. \"I\u0027m not a fool!\" \n \n \"Then how in the devil\u0027s name are we to do it?\" Baptist retorted with irritation. \n \n \"Stay yourself and take care of him!\" \n \n \"And let you find the stuff!\" with an ugly look. \"A nice reckoning I should get afterwards.\" \n \n \"Well, I won\u0027t stay, that\u0027s flat!\" \n \n The men looked at one another, and their lowering glances disclosed their embarrassment. The prisoner could make no guess at the subject of discussion, but he saw that they were verging on a quarrel, and his heart beat fast. Given the slightest chance he was resolved to take it. But, that his thoughts might not be read, he kept his eyes on the ground, and feigned a sullenness which he no longer felt. \n \n Suddenly, \"Tie him to a tree!\" muttered one of the men with a sidelong look at him. \n \n \"And leave him?\" \n \n \"Ay, why not?\" \n \n \"Why not?\" Baptist, the eldest of the men, rejoined with an oath. \"Because if harm happen to him, it will be I will pay for it, and not you! That is why not!\" \n \n \"Tie him well and what can happen?\" the other retorted. And then, \"Must risk something, Baptist,\" he added with a grin, which showed that he saw his advantage, \"since you are in charge.\" \n \n The secret was simple. The men had got wind that morning of a saddle and saddle-bags--and a dead horse, but that counted for nothing--that in the search after the attack on the Countess\u0027s party had been overlooked in the scrub. Detached to guard the prisoner to Vlaye they had grinned at the chance of forestalling their comrades and gaining what there was to gain; which fancy, ever sanguine, painted in the richest colours. But the five could neither trust one another nor their prisoner; for Charles might inform Vlaye, and in that case they would not only lose the spoil but taste the strapado--the Captain of Vlaye permitting but one robber in his band. Hence they stood in the position of the ass between two bundles of hay, and dared not leave their prisoner, nor would leave the spoil. \n \n At length, after some debate, made up in the main of oaths, \"Draw lots who stays!\" one suggested. \n \n \"We have no cards.\" \n \n \"There are other ways.\" \n \n \"Well,\" said he who had charge of the prisoner, \"whose horse stops drinking first--let him stay!\" \n \n \"Oh, yes!\" retorted Baptist. \"And we have watered our horses and you have not!\" \n \n The man grinned feebly; the others laughed. \"Well,\" he said, \"do you hit on something then! You think yourself clever.\" \n \n Villeneuve bethought him of the prince who set, his guards to race, and, when their horses were spent, galloped away laughing. But he dared not suggest that, though he tingled with anxiety. \"Who sees a heron first,\" said one. \n \n But \"Pooh!\" with a grin, \"we are all liars!\" put an end to that. \n \n \"Well,\" said Baptist sulkily, \"if we stay here a while longer we shall all lie for nothing, for we shall have the Captain upon us.\" \n \n Thus spurred a man had an idea that seemed fair. \"We\u0027ve no two horses alike,\" he said. \"Let us pluck a hair from the tail of each. He\"--pointing to Charles--\"shall draw one with his eyes shut, and whoever is drawn shall stay on guard.\" \n \n They agreed to this, and Charles, being applied to, consented with a sulky air to play his part. The hairs were plucked, a grey, a chestnut, a bay, a black, and a sorrel; and the prisoner, foreseeing that he would be left with a single trooper, and determined in that case to essay escape, shut his eyes and felt for the five hairs, and selected one. The man drawn was the man who had last had him in charge, and to whose saddle his reins were still attached. \n \n The man cursed his ill-fortune; the others laughed. \"All the same,\" he cried, \"if you play me false you\u0027ll laugh on the other side of your faces!\" \n \n \"Tut, tut, Martin!\" they jeered in answer. \"Have no fear!\" And they scarce made a secret of their intention to cheat him. \n \n The four turned, laughing, and plunged into the undergrowth which clothed the hill. Still their course could be traced by the snapping of dry sticks, the scramble of a horse on a steep place, or the scared notes of blackbirds, fleeing low among the bushes. Slowly Martin\u0027s eyes followed their progress along the hill, and as his eyes moved, he moved also, foot by foot, through the brook, glaring, listening, and now and then muttering threats in his beard. \n \n Had he glanced round once, however impatiently, and seen the pale face and feverish eyes at his elbow, he had taken the alarm. Charles knew that the thing must be done now or not at all; and that there must be one critical moment. If nerve failed him then, or the man turned, or aught happened to thwart his purpose midway, he had far better have left the thing untried. \n \n Now or not at all! He glanced over his shoulder and saw the sun shining on the flat rushy plat beyond the ford, which the horses\u0027 feet had fouled while their riders debated. He saw no sign of Vlaye coming up, nor anything to alarm him. The road was clear were he once free. Martin\u0027s horse had stepped from the water, his own was in act to follow, his guard sat, therefore, a little higher than himself; in a flash he stooped, seized the other\u0027s boot, and with a desperate heave flung him over on the off side. \n \n He clutched, as the man fell, at his reins; they were life or death to him. But though the fellow let them slip, the frightened horse sprang aside, and swung them out of reach. There remained but one thing he could do; he struck his own horse in the hope it would run away and drag the other with it. \n \n But the other, rearing and plunging, backed from him, and the two, pulling in different directions, held their ground until the trooper had risen, run to his horse\u0027s head and caught the reins. \"Body of Satan!\" he panted with a pale scowl; the fall had shaken him. \"I\u0027ll have your blood for this! Quiet, beast! Quiet!\" \n \n In his passion he struck the horse on the head; an act which carried its punishment. The beast backed from him and dragged him, still clinging to the reins, into the brook. In a moment the two horses were plunging about in the water, and he following them was knee deep. Unfortunately Villeneuve was helpless. All he could do was to strike his horse and excite it further. But the man would not let go, and the horses, fastened together, circled round one another until the trooper, notwithstanding their movements, managed to shorten the reins, and at last got his horse by the bit. \n \n \"Curse you!\" he said again. \"Now I\u0027ve got you! And in a minute, my lad, I\u0027ll make you pay for this!\" \n \n But Villeneuve, seeing defeat stare him in the face, had made use of the last few seconds. He had loosened the stirrup-leather from the trooper\u0027s saddle, and as the fellow, thinking the struggle over, grinned at him, he swung the heavy iron in the air, and brought it down on the beast\u0027s withers. It leapt forward, maddened by pain, dashed the man to the ground, and dragging Villeneuve\u0027s horse with it, whether it would or no, in a moment both were clear of the brook and plunging along the bank. \n \n Villeneuve struck the horses again to urge them forward; but only to learn that which he should have recognised before; that to escape on a horse, fastened to a second, over difficult ground and through a wood, was not possible. Half-maddened, half-bewildered, they bore him into a mass of thorns and bushes. It was all he could do to guard his eyes and head, more than they could do to keep their feet. A moment and a tough sapling intervened, the rein which joined them snapped, and his horse, giving to the tug at its mouth, fell on its near shoulder. \n \n Bound to his saddle, he could not save himself, but fortunately the soil was soft, the leg that was under the horse was not broken, and for a moment the animal made no effort to rise. Villeneuve, despair in his heart, and the sweat running down his face, had no power to rise. Nor would the power have availed him, for before he could have gone a dozen paces through the tangle of thorns, the troopers, some on horseback, and some on foot, were on him. \n \n The man from whom he had escaped was a couple of paces in front of the others. He had snatched up a stick, and black with rage, raised it to strike the prostrate horse. Had the blow fallen and the horse struggled to his feet, Villeneuve must have been trampled. Fortunately Baptist was in time to catch the man\u0027s arm and stay the blow. \"Fool!\" he said. \"Do you want to kill the man?\" \n \n \"Ay, by Heaven!\" the fellow shrieked. \"He nearly killed me!\" \n \n \"Well, you\u0027ll not do it!\" Baptist retorted, and he pushed him back. \"Do you hear? I have no mind to account for his loss to the Captain, if you have.\" \n \n \"Do you think that I am going to be pitched on my head by a Jack-a-dandy like that,\" the fellow snarled, \"and do naught? And where is my share?\" \n \n The grizzled man stooped, and, while one of his comrades held down the horse\u0027s head, untied Villeneuve\u0027s feet, and drew him from under the beast. \"Share?\" he answered with a sneer as he rose. \"What time had we to find the thing?\" \n \n \"You have not found it?\" \n \n \"No--thanks to you! What kind of a guard do you call yourself?\" Baptist continued ferociously. \"By this time, had you done your part, we had done ours! If there is to be any accounting, you\u0027ll account to us!\" \n \n \"Ay,\" the others cried, \"Baptist is right, my lad!\" \n \n The man, seeing himself outnumbered, cast a devilish look at them. He turned on his heel. When he was gone a couple of paces, \"Very good,\" he said over his shoulder, \"but when I get you alone----\" \n \n \"You!\" Baptist roared, and took three strides towards him. \"You, when you get me alone! Stand to me now, then, and let them see what you will do!\" \n \n But the malcontent, with the same look of hate, continued to retreat. Baptist jeered. \"That is better!\" he said. \"But we knew what you were before! Now, lads, to horse, we\u0027ve lost time enough!\" \n \n Flinging a mocking laugh after the craven the troopers turned. But to meet with a surprise. By their horses\u0027 heads stood a strange man smiling at them. \"I arrest all here!\" he said quietly. He had nothing but a riding switch in his hand, and Villeneuve\u0027s eyes opened wide as he recognised in him the guest of the Tower Chamber. \"In the King\u0027s name, lay down your arms!\" \n \n They stared at him as if he had fallen from the skies. Even Baptist lost the golden moment, and, in place of flinging himself upon the stranger, repeated, \"Lay down our arms? Who, in the name of thunder, are you?\" \n \n \"No matter!\" the other answered. \"You are surrounded, my man. See! And see!\" He pointed in two directions with his switch. \n \n Baptist glared through the bushes, and saw eight or ten horsemen posted along the hill-side above him. He looked across the brook, and there also were two or three stalwart figures, seated motionless in their saddles. \n \n The others looked helplessly to Baptist. \"Understand,\" he said, with uneasy defiance. \"You will answer for this. We are the Captain of Vlaye\u0027s men!\" \n \n \"I know naught of the Captain of Vlaye,\" was the stern reply. \"Surrender, and your lives shall be spared. Resist, and your blood be on your own heads!\" \n \n Baptist counted heads rapidly, and saw that he was outnumbered. He gave the word, and after one fashion or another, some recklessly, some stolidly, the men threw down their arms. \"Only--you will answer for this!\" Baptist repeated. \n \n \"I shall answer for it,\" des Ageaux replied gravely. \"In the meantime I desire a word with your prisoner. M. de Villeneuve, this way if you please.\" \n \n He was proceeding to lead Charles a little apart. But his back had not been turned three seconds when a thing happened. The man who had slunk away before Baptist\u0027s challenge had got to horse unnoticed. At a little distance from the others, he had not surrendered his arms. Whether he could not from where he was see the horsemen who guarded the further side of the brook, and so thought escape in that direction open, or he could not resist the temptation to wreak his spite on Baptist at all risks, he chose this moment to ride up behind him, draw a pistol from the holster, and fire it into the unfortunate man\u0027s back. Then with a yell that echoed his victim\u0027s death-cry he crashed through the undergrowth in the direction of the brook. \n \n But already, \"Seize him! Seize him!\" rose above the wood in a dozen voices. \"On your life, seize him!\" \n \n The order was executed almost as soon as uttered. As the horse leaping the water alighted on the lower bank, it swerved to avoid a trooper who barred the way. The turn surprised the rider; he lost his balance. Before he could get back into his seat, a trooper knocked him from the saddle with the flat of his sword. In a trice he was seized, disarmed, and dragged across the brook. \n \n But by that time Baptist, with three slugs under his shoulder-blade, lay still among the moss and briars, the hand that had beaten time to a thousand camp-ditties in a thousand quarters from Fontarabie to Flanders flung nerveless beside a wood-wren\u0027s nest. As they gathered round him Charles, who had never seen a violent death, gazed on the limp form with a pale face, questioning, with that wonder which the thoughtful of all times have felt, whither the mind that a minute before looked from those sightless eyes had taken its flight. \n \n He was roused by the Lieutenant\u0027s voice, speaking in tones measured and stern as fate. \"Let him have five minutes,\" he said, \"and then--that tree will be best!\" \n \n They began to drag the wretch, now pale as ashes, in the direction indicated. Half way to the tree the man began to struggle, breaking into piercing shrieks that he was Vlaye\u0027s man, that they had no right---- \n \n \"Stay, right he shall have!\" des Ageaux cried solemnly. \"He is judged and doomed by me, Governor of Périgord, for murder in Curia. In the King\u0027s name! Now take him!\" \n \n The wretch was dragged off, his judge to all appearance deaf to his cries. But Charles could close neither his ears nor his heart. The man had earned his doom richly. But to stand by while a fellow-creature, vainly shrieking for mercy, mercy, was strangled within his hearing, turned him sick and faint. \n \n Des Ageaux read his thoughts. \"To spare here were to kill there,\" he said coldly. \"Learn, my friend, that to rule men is no work for a soft heart or a gentle hand. But you are shaken. Come this way,\" he continued in a different tone; \"you will be the better for some wine.\" He took out a flask and gave it to Charles, who, excessively thirsty now he thought of it, drank greedily. \"That is better,\" des Ageaux went on, seeing the colour return to his cheeks. \"Now I wish for information. Where are the nearest Crocans?\" \n \n The young man\u0027s face fell. \"The nearest Crocans?\" he muttered mechanically. \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"I----\" \n \n \"Are there any within three hours\u0027 ride of us?\" \n \n But Charles had by this time pulled himself together. He held out his wrists. \"I am your prisoner,\" he said. \"Call up your men and bind me. You can do with me as you please. But I am a Villeneuve, and I do not betray.\" \n \n \"Not even----\" \n \n \"You saw me turn pale?\" the young man continued. \"Believe me, I can bear to go to the tree better than to see another dragged there!\" \n \n Des Ageaux smiled. \"Nay, but you mistake me, M. de Villenueve,\" he said. \"I ask you to betray no one. It is I who wish to enlist with you.\" \n \n \"With us?\" Charles exclaimed. And he stared in bewilderment. \n \n \"With you. In fact you see before you,\" des Ageaux continued, his eyes twinkling, his hand stroking his short beard, \"a Crocan. Frankly, and to be quite plain, I want their help; a little later my help may save them. They fear an attack by the Captain of Vlaye? I am prepared to aid them against him. Afterwards----\" \n \n \"Ay, afterwards.\" \n \n \"If they will hear reason, what can be done in their behalf I will do! But there must be no Jacquerie, no burning, and no plundering. In a word,\" with a flitting smile, \"it is now for the Crocans to say whether the Captain of Vlaye shall earn the King\u0027s pardon by quelling them--or they by quelling him.\" \n \n \"But you are the Governor of Périgord?\" Charles exclaimed. \n \n \"I am the King\u0027s Lieutenant in Périgord, which is the same thing.\" \n \n \"And in this business?\" \n \n \"I am in the position of the finger which is set between the door and the jamb! But no matter for that, you will not understand. Only do you tell me where these Crocans lie, and we will visit them if it can be done before night. To-night I must be back\"--with a peculiar look--\"for I have other business.\" \n \n Charles told him, and with joy. Ay, with joy. As a sail to the raft-borne seaman awash in the Biscayan Gulf, or a fountain to the parched wanderer in La Mancha, this and more to him was the prospect suddenly opened before his eyes. To be snatched at a word from the false position in which he had placed himself, and from which naught short of a miracle could save him! To find for ally, instead of the broken farmers and ruined clowns, the governor of a great province! To be free to carve his fortune with his right hand where he would! These, indeed, were blessings that a minute before had seemed as far from him as home from the seaman who feels his craft settling down in a shoreless water. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1494/44657.html","bookId":1320,"book":{"id":1320,"title":"Abbess Of Vlaye","description":"简介： Monsieur des Ageaux was a man of whom his best friends could not say that he shone, or tried to shine, in the pursuit of the fair sex.
