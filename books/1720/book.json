{"id":1720,"title":"Annabel (Delirium #0.5)","description":"Storyline: Annabel (Delirium 0.5) Lena\u0027s mother, Annabel, has always been a mystery—a ghost in Lena\u0027s past. Until now. Discover her secrets in Lauren Oliver\u0027s brilliant original digital story set in the world of New York Times bestsellers Delirium and Pandemonium. Lena Halloway\u0027s mother, Annabel, supposedly committed suicide when Lena was only six years old. That\u0027s the lie that Lena grew up believing, but the truth is very different. As a rebellious teenager, Annabel ran away from home and straight into the man she knew she was destined to marry. The world was different then—the regulations not as stringent, the cure only a decade old. Fast forward to the present, and Annabel is consigned to a dirty prison cell, where she nurtures her hope of escape and scratches one word over and over into the walls: Love. But Annabel, like Lena, is a fighter. Through chapters that alternate between her past and present, Annabel reveals the story behind her failed cures, her marriage, the births of her children, her imprisonment, and, ultimately, her daring escape.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/annabel-delirium-0-5.jpg","author":"Lauren Oliver","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":4,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
