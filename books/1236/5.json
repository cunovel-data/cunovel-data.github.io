{"id":9809,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V","content":"Three nights after the conversation between De Beaurepaire and Emérance, the clock of St. Germain-l\u0027Auxerrois was striking ten and the couvre-feu was sounding from the steeples of many other church towers, as a large, substantial travelling carriage drawn by six horses passed slowly out of the Rue Richelieu and took its way through the great open Place du Louvre towards where the Bastille stood, and, beyond that, the Porte St. Antoine. \n \n A few minutes, perhaps a quarter of an hour, before this time, that carriage had been stationed in one of the narrow streets running out of the Rue Richelieu and, to it, there had advanced two young men dressed in the height of the fashion of the period. But their velvet and lace, their silk stockings and high red-heeled shoes, and also their rapiers, were all hidden, since they were covered up by the large furred houppelandes with which these young gallants were enveloped from their throats to their heels. So much enveloped that the patches on their faces were even more invisible than were their remarkably bright eyes and, indeed, the greater part of their features. \n \n Behind these evident scions of the haut monde there walked a young serving man, or servitor, dressed in a sober, faded-leaf coloured costume yet having on his head a great hat from which the long cocks-plumes depended and fell over his face, and, at his side, a stout rapier of the Flamberg order. \n \n Drawing near to the carriage at which one or two passers-by were looking curiously, while one of the night-watch who happened to be in the neighbourhood was doing the same, one of the two young men turned round to the servitor behind and said:-- \n \n \"Jean, have you left word that we shall return at midnight from the masquerade and that we shall require supper?\" \n \n \"I have, Monsieur le Vicomte.\" \n \n \"So be it. Therefore, Pierre,\" said the vicomte, addressing his friend, \"let us away. Already the first dance will be over and, me confond! there are plenty of beaux yeux will be looking for our arrival. Fellows,\" glancing up at the coachman and footman on the box, \"set out. And miss not your way. Remember,\" speaking loudly and harshly, \"\u0027tis to the Rue de la Dauphine we go; to the house of Monsieur le Marquis de Vieuxchastel. If you proceed not straight you shall be whipped to-morrow. You hear, dog?\" \n \n \"I hear, Monsieur le Vicomte,\" the coachman answered in a surly tone, though, as he did so, he turned his head and looked at a bystander under the oil lamp, and thrust his tongue into his cheek and winked and muttered an offensive word. \n \n \"So be it,\" the vicomte said, as he got into the carriage after his friend and while the servitor clambered up behind. \"So be it. Now be off. Do you hear, beasts? En route for the Rue de la Dauphine.\" \n \n Slowly, therefore, because all large vehicles progressed but heavily over the uneven roads of Paris, the great carriage went on its way; though, since, instead of at once crossing the Pont Neuf--which is so old!--it continued to remain on the north side of the river, it would seem that the coachman had, in truth, missed his way in spite of the injunctions of the vicomte. \n \n Soon, too, by following this route, the carriage was underneath the frowning towers of the Bastille and passing by the moat in front of the great door, and so went on through the Marais and past old streets and, at last, past old houses standing alone and having, in some cases, thatched roofs. A few minutes later it neared the Porte St. Antoine with its great wooden, iron-studded gate closed for the night. \n \n But, here, by the side of the road, which was but a mass of dry mud, there stood a house, or rather cottage, with a penthouse roof, having outside of it a staircase leading to the upper floor. A house that had, also, a long wall running at right angles from it which threw a darkness deeper than that of the starlight night itself over all beneath it. \n \n \"This,\" said the coachman to the footman, \"is the spot,\" while the servitor who was behind noticed that the speaker crossed himself. \"Bon Dieu!\" the man went on, \"what a place for a love tryst, an elopement.\" \n \n \"\u0027Twill serve,\" the other fellow said; \"and he in there wants neither De Beaurepaire nor us yet.\" \n \n \"And never will, Dieu le plaise,\" the trembling coachman said, since the man who inhabited this house was the executioner. \n \n Then, the carriage, which had gradually drawn into the deepest shadow of the wall came to a stop, and, from out that shadow, there stepped forth a man. A man who, advancing to the door of the vehicle, opened it and said:-- \n \n \"So! you are here. Both. And, for the third--Humphrey West?\" \n \n \"He is here, Monsieur le Chevalier,\" the supposed servitor behind replied, jumping down from the banquette. \"Here.\" \n \n \"And you, my noble and illustrious friends,\" the Prince said, glancing up at the coachman and footman, \"my noble friends of the tripot and the gargote; how fares it with you? Cadédis! the ride you have before you will wash all the fumes of Van den Enden\u0027s poisoned wine out of you. When you return to Paris with your pockets stuffed full of pistoles your mothers will not know you.\" \n \n \"Now,\" ignoring the answers which the two men on the box growled back; men who were, in truth, Fleur de Mai and Boisfleury. \"Now, all is arranged. You, Madame la Duchesse,\" addressing the handsome young gallant who had hitherto been termed M. le Vicomte, \"will ride through the gate by my side. You, Mademoiselle d\u0027Angelis, will ride with the faithful Humphrey. While as for you,\" looking up at the men above, \"you will follow close behind.\" \n \n As thus De Beaurepaire spoke, from behind where Paris lay there fell upon the ears of those assembled near the gatehouse the sounds of a horse\u0027s hoofs, of a horse in full gallop, while, to them, were added the jangle of bridle and bridoon as well as another sound which told of a sword clanking against stirrup and spur in accompaniment with the action of the horse\u0027s body. \n \n \"Are we pursued?\" asked Fleur de Mai, his big hand ready to draw his weapon from its sheath. \"If so, one thrust through the horse and then another through the rider and, lo! there is no further pursuit,\" and he laughed, indeed gurgled, deep down in his chest. \n \n \"If it should be my husband or one of his menials!\" the Duchess murmured fearfully. \n \n \"Tush!\" exclaimed De Beaurepaire, \"there is but one, and we are four. While if the rider is soldier, gendarme, or police spy, he takes his orders from me. What have we to fear therefore?\" \n \n Suddenly, however, he gave a laugh and said, \"Listen. Hark to him how he sings as he rides along. \u0027Tis La Truaumont who has drunk his last cup in Paris quicker than one might have deemed, and has caught us on the road sooner than I, who know him well, could have expected.\" \n \n And so, in truth, it was. Upon the night air were borne the strains of a song the adventurer was singing: in a deep, rich voice was being trilled forth the chanson:-- \n \n Pour faire ton ame et ton corps \n Le ciel épuisa ses trésors, \n \n Landrirette, Landriri. \n \n En graces, en beauté, en attraits \n Nul n\u0027égalera jamais, \n \n Landrirette, Landriri. \n \n \"Hola!\" he cried, breaking off suddenly in his tribute of admiration to some real or imaginary beauty while reining in his steed with a sudden jerk. \"Hola! What have we here? Young gallants in cloak, plume and sword; the great and mighty Prince de----\" \n \n \"Peace. No names, imbecile,\" exclaimed the latter. \n \n \"And all the basketful,\" La Truaumont continued, taking no notice of his leader\u0027s words. \"My own beloved Fleur de Mai, countryman and companion----\" \n \n \"\u0027Tis true, though you say it,\" growled Fleur de Mai in a harsh, sonorous voice. \n \n \"And Boisfleury. The illustrious Boisfleury. Good! Good!\" When, addressing De Beaurepaire, La Truaumont continued, \"Noble Prince, do we not pass the barrier to-night, or do we sleep at attention outside that?\" and he nodded to the gloomy house close by. \n \n \"No. Since you are come so much the better. We will all pass through together,\" and he repeated the instructions he had given before La Truaumont came up, while adding, \"For your descriptions, remember that you,\" to Boisfleury and Fleur de Mai, \"are of my following, and you,\" to Humphrey, \"that which you please to term yourself. You, madame and mademoiselle,\" addressing the Duchess and Jacquette with a smile, \"know also who and what you are. Now for the horses. They are here. Come all and mount, excepting you La Truaumont who are already provided for.\" \n \n Giving his arm to the Duchess as he spoke he led the way to a still darker portion of the wall, under which were six horses all saddled and bridled and by the heads of which stood two of his own grooms. \n \n \"Ah, ha!\" exclaimed Humphrey, as a grey mare looked round and whinnied as he approached, \"there she is, my pretty \u0027Soupir,\u0027\" and going up to her he stroked her silky muzzle and whispered to her. \n \n \"To horse,\" said De Beaurepaire, \"to horse all. Madame,\" to the Duchess, \"mount,\" while she, obeying him, put her foot in the stirrup and her hand to the mane and raised herself to the saddle as easily as she might have done had she been in truth the cavalier she pretended to be. \n \n A minute or two after, all were mounted. The Prince was on a great fiery chestnut which might have been chosen with the purpose of matching the strong masterful man who now bestrode it; Jacquette was on a mare lithe as Soupir herself, and the two desperadoes on horses strong and muscular. \n \n \"Summon the gate,\" the former said now. \"Summon in the name of the King.\" \n \n \"Open,\" cried La Truaumont, \"open. Par ordre du Roi. Open, I say.\" \n \n \"Who are you?\" cried out a voice from the gatehouse window, at which a man\u0027s face had by now appeared. \"Who are you that summon thus in the name of the King? Stand and answer.\" \n \n \"The Prince and Chevalier Louis De Beaurepaire, Grand Veneur and Colonel of all His Majesty\u0027s Guards,\" replied La Truaumont, knowing well that his master would not deign to answer at all. \"Attended by the Chief of his own bodyguard, the Captain de La Truaumont.\" \n \n \"And the others, most worshipful sir?\" \n \n \"The Vicomte d\u0027Aignay-le-Duc,\" called back Humphrey, naming, as had been decided, one of the Duchess\u0027s estates, \"attended by Monsieur Jean de Beauf?ret,\" naming another, \"followed by their attendant, Monsieur Homfroi.\" \n \n \"And the others, who are they, illustrious seigneur?\" \n \n \"Le Capitaine Fleur de Mai, Le Colonel Boisfleury, both of Prince de Beaurepaire\u0027s bodyguard,\" bawled the former in an authoritative, dictatorial voice. \n \n \"Pass all,\" the man said now, the gate beginning to creak on its hinges as he spoke. \"Pass. Good-night, noble seigneurs.\" \n \n \"Bid him let the gate remain open,\" De Beaurepaire said to La Truaumont. \"Tell him I do but ride outside it, there to make my adieux to the \u0027Vicomte\u0027.\" \n \n After which, and when this order had been given, all rode through the gate. The travellers were outside Paris; they had left it behind. \n \n All had done so with the exception of De Beaurepaire who--since he had fulfilled his promise of preventing the Duchess from being interfered with in her flight from a mad husband until, at least, she was outside the city walls--was about to say farewell to the party. \n \n \"Farewell, Louis de Beaurepaire,\" that lady said now, as she placed her long-gloved hand in his, while her soft, dark eyes looked out at him from under her curled wig and plumed hat, \"farewell. You have placed me in the way that leads to safety and freedom; I beseech of you to do nothing that may make safety and freedom strangers to you. Hear my last words before I go. Even as now you turn back to Paris and all the honours that you have, so turn back from that which may deprive you of all honour; ay! and more. Addio.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1613/47762.html","bookId":1236,"book":{"id":1236,"title":"Traitor and True","description":"简介： The doors of the Taverne Gabrielle, in the Rue des Franc Bourgeois in the Marais, stood open to all passers-by, and also to the cool wind blowing from the south-east.
