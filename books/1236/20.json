{"id":9824,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX","content":"It was a bright, sunny morning when De Beaurepaire drew rein in the long, dirty street of Charenton, and, turning his horse\u0027s head, directed it towards the hamlet of Saint Mandé where his Lodge was. The Lodge that, enshrouded in trees, stood on the edge of the Forest of Vincennes and was one of the many which, wherever there was a royal forest, were the residences of the Grand Veneur of the time being. Leading his animal to the stables, while observing that already the heavy curtains were drawn apart and the inmates stirring, he tethered it in a stall and fetched a feed for it from the bin near at hand. After which he locked the stable door with the key he had drawn from his pocket, retraced his steps to the garden, and, mounting to the verandah, went towards the window. If, however, he did this with the intention of tapping on it and thus attracting the notice of whosoever might be, within that room, this intention was anticipated. As his heavy riding-boots sounded on the crushed shell path and his gilt spurs rang at his heels, he heard the frou-frou of a woman\u0027s long robe on the parquet of the room and saw the thick folds of the stamped leather hangings drawn aside by a slim white hand, and, next, one side of the window opened. A moment later he was in the room, and the woman who called herself Emérance de Villiers-Bordéville stood before him. \"So,\" she exclaimed in a whisper, the very murmur of which told of her joy at having him with her once more; \"so you are back once more. And almost to the moment, as you promised. Ah! I have so longed to see you since you quitted Paris for Fontainebleau.\" Then she said, \"Come, see, a meal is prepared. Come, refresh yourself, eat and drink and let us be merry. We meet once more.\" Yet, as she spoke and while gazing up into the handsome face of the man before her, she saw something in that face, something in the dark eyes that were looking down into hers, that startled her. \"What is it?\" she asked in a low voice, a voice that was almost hoarse in its depth. \"What?\" \"I will tell you,\" De Beaurepaire answered, \"but first a drink of wine. I am parched and dry with my ride, and also with a fever that consumes me within. Give me the drink.\" Obeying him, the woman went over to the table which stood at one side of the room; a table set out with cold meats, a pasty and some salads and, also, with a large flask of wine, when, pouring out some into a goblet, she brought it to the man she loved. As he drank, eagerly, thirstily, she let her eyes rest on him till he had finished the draught. After which she said again, \"What is it?\" \"This. Humphrey West is alive. La Truaumont has either lied to me or been deceived.\" \"Alive!\" Emérance repeated, her face blanching as she spoke, while the softness of it seemed to vanish, to leave it in a moment, and her \\ eyes became dim. \"Humphrey West--the man who heard--as they all thought--what was said in that room at Basle.\" \"Yes. Alive and--at Fontainebleau.\" \"Malheur!\" while, as Emérance spoke, the goblet she had taken from his hand after he had finished drinking fell to the floor and shivered into a dozen pieces on the parquet. \"At Fontainebleau! Where the King is. So,\" and she shuddered as though the room had suddenly grown cold. \"You are undone. Lost. Oh!\" \"You are undone. Lost,\" she had said. She had not said, \"We are undone.\" And, as she said it, the man knew, if he had never known before, how strong her love was for him. There had been no thought of, no fear for, herself springing quickly to her mind in learning the danger that overhung them both, though there could have been no possibility of her failing to understand that what threatened him threatened her also; she had thought only of him. She had not said, \"We are undone.\" Her wail, her terror had been for him alone. \"Emérance,\" De Beaurepaire said, taking her to his arms now and kissing her, while--whatever the man\u0027s faults were, and they were many and grievous!--indifference to the self-abnegation of this thing that, he now knew, loved him so, could not be counted among them. \"Emérance, I think not of myself but you. I have staked and lost. I must stand the hazard. Les battus payent l\u0027amende.\" \"No, no,\" Emérance wailed. \"What! You think of me! Of me the schemer, the adventuress--the woman who is herself of Normandy, who hoped to see this proud, masterful ruler beaten down by the Normans he despises and treats evilly. The woman who hoped to see the man she loves, the man she worships, help in the work and, perhaps, assume that ruler\u0027s place. Who am I that you should think of me? Yet, nevertheless, this sunders our lives. Or! no--no!\" she went on, a wan smile stealing on to her face. \"For though we go out of each other\u0027s lives it may be that we shall set out from each other together, at the same time--though we go different dark roads at parting.\" Excited, overmastered, by what her imagination conjured up, at what must be their fate if their conspiracy was known by now to the King, she went toward the table again and, filling another glass, drank it to the dregs. After which, as though inspirited by what she had drunk, she came back to where the other stood, while saying:-- \"Tell me all. Have you seen him at Fontainebleau?\" \"Five hours past. Ill, white, like a man who has been close to, who has knocked at, death\u0027s door, yet has been refused admittance. In the great avenue, on his road to the chateau.\" \"You could not have been mistaken?\" \"I was not mistaken. Our eyes did not meet as he looked out of the crazy conveyance in which he sat. But in seeing him, I learnt all.\" \"Was La Truaumont deceived in what he repeated to you--or--or is that wretch, Van den Enden, a double traitor? Yet--yet--you told me ere you went to Fontainebleau that the former said La Preaux forced Humphrey West to fight with him and slew him, leaving the blame to fall on Boisfleury. That he saw the young man slain.\" \"La Truaumont was not deceived nor did he lie. He saw the fight: he saw the other fall. Yet, now, I have seen him alive. This very day. Alive and making his way to the King.\" \"And ere the Englishman was killed he had killed Boisfleury?\" Emérance asked meditatively. \"Nay. La Truaumont thought not so but that he only wounded him sorely.\" \"They should have killed him ere they left Basle. They should have killed them both. They should have made sure of their silence for ever. Thus, too, when they were found they would have been thought to have slain each other; their lips would have been sealed--you would have been safe.\" \"Emérance, think not of me alone. I am but one.\" \"But one! You are the only one of whom I can think. What are a thousand lives, a thousand murders, to me so long as you are safe!\" Before this overmastering passion of the woman for him, this love that, like the love of the tigress for its mate or its young, would have swept the lives of all in the world away to preserve the one thing precious to it, De Beaurepaire stood speechless. In truth it startled him--startled even him who had known so much of women\u0027s love yet had never known such love as this. \"Nevertheless,\" Emérance went on, fearing that the violence of her passion, of her fears for her lover, might make him deem her what she was not, \"I would have had no blood shed, and treacherously shed, too, had you been safe. Had I known before what I know now since La Truaumont and I have met again in Paris, had I guessed that this Englishman had overheard all, the attempt to do him cruelly to death should not have been made. At least, that ruffian, La Preaux, who masquerades under his buffoon\u0027s name of Fleur de Mai, should not have tried his treacherous botte on him. I would have seen the eavesdropper, have sworn him to secrecy, and have saved him.\" \"La Truaumont would have saved him if he could. He endeavoured to swear him to silence, to make him give a promise to breathe no word. Had the other consented all would be well. But----\" \"But?\"--with an inward catching of her breath. \"But he refused scornfully. He boasted how, that very night, he would be on his road to Louis to divulge all. Therefore it had to be. His blood was on his own head. If he had slain Fleur de Mai, as it appears he went near to doing, La Truaumont would have slain him.\" And De Beaurepaire muttered, \"it had to be,\" while adding, \"and still it was not done.\" Shrugging her shoulders the woman exclaimed, \"Yes, and--alas!--still it was not done. He is alive and the King by now knows all. Only--will he believe upon this man\u0027s testimony alone? Will he act at once, without further proof or corroboration, ere he is sure?\" When Emérance de Villiers-Bordéville, as she called herself, asked this question, she did not know, could not know that there had already come a letter from England from Louise de Kéroualle, Duchess of Portsmouth--herself a spy of France--to Louis, telling him as much as, if not more than, Humphrey West could tell him of the Norman plot against him. Nor could she also know that, from Basle, had come another letter from the Duchesse de Castellucchio telling him in more guarded language (since she, at least, could not betray De Beaurepaire) of what she had gathered, and bidding him beware of Spain and Holland. \"I know not what he will do, nor what he will believe, nor if any name is yet divulged,\" the Prince replied, \"though, when he spoke with me last evening ere I left him, he dwelt strangely, ay! and strongly too, on our boyhood\u0027s companionship and my command of all his guards. But, Emérance, tell me what was said of me that night in your room. Was my name spoken so that this man listening in the next one might easily catch it; was my share in all laid bare? Think, recall; and speak boldly to me. For if it was----\" \"Yes; if it was, what then?\" \"Then there is but one thing left. Flight----\" \"Ah! From me?\" \"Nay, never. But flight together. I will never part from you in life. As man and wife we fly together.\" \"Ah!\" \"Never otherwise! Now, Emérance, speak. Tell all.\" \"If,\" Emérance said, after meditating deeply for some moments, while there was on her face the look which all have seen when those with whom they converse are thinking carefully, or endeavouring to recall some once spoken words; \"if--if--this man overheard me and La Truaumont the first night, then--he--heard your name. Because La Truaumont said that you might rise to even higher flights than the proud position of a De Beaurepaire.\" \"Dieu des Dieux! If he did hear! Well! On the next night?\" \"On the next night,\" Emérance continued, \"ah! let me recall. Yes. On the next night your name was again uttered. By me--accursed be my tongue!--when I spoke of rejoining you here in Paris, and by La Truaumont by the sobriquet I love to hear applied to you, that of \u0027Le Dédaigneux.\u0027 For disdainful you are to all--except to me,\" her voice sinking to a murmur as she added those last two words. \"Ha!\" De Beaurepaire said with a grim smile, \"if Humphrey West heard no mention of my name by you, he would scarce know that I am \u0027Le Dédaigneux\u0027.\" \"Alas,\" the woman almost wailed, \"\u0027twas touched upon that the King\u0027s guards had been despatched to join the main body of the army: that Le Dédaigneux had taken heed for that. Le Dédaigneux--their colonel.\" \"Enough. With this he knows all. And by now Louis and De Louvois, too, who never leaves his master\u0027s side, know it also. It is enough, more than enough. When the Court returns from Fontainebleau four days hence La Reynie will know it as well.\" \"Four days! You have four days in which to escape, to hide yourself, to put some frontier between you and the King\u0027s wrath! Ah! heaven! you are saved.\" \"And lost also. Once I cross any frontier I shall never recross it, never return to France. Never. Never. And I am a De Beaurepaire; my blood, my life is drawn from France and I shall never see it more.\" \"Nay. With time the King will forgive. You have often said his heart is kindly, that he is never cruel. That he has forgiven much to both women and men who have deceived him.\" \"Ay, to both women and men. But the women were false to his heart alone, and there are thousands of other women in France as fair as they: a king woos and wins where he will. And the men he has forgiven have but forgotten for a moment the difference between him and them; but when it is his throne, his crown, that is in danger, he never forgives.\" \"Seize then upon these four days; fly to Holland or Switzerland, or Italy, and escape. Sell your charges to those whom you have oft told me would buy them, and fly.\" \"And you? You--my love?\" \"As you bid me I will do. If you will have me by your side, or go before you or stay behind, you must but say the word and I obey. Do with me as you would with your favourite dog; leave me or take me. \"I will never leave you,\" her lover murmured. \"Never. We escape together----\" \"Or we fall together. Is it not so?\" \"It is so. And, remember, our danger and our safety go hand in hand. If either of us is found in Paris when once La Reynie\u0027s blood-hounds are let loose, there will be but one end for both.\" \"No matter so that we share that end. Yet,\" she said suddenly, recalling what both had forgotten. \"There is La Truaumont. Also Van den Enden and the bully, La Preaux. The former, at least, should be warned.\" \"La Truaumont shall be. As for the Jew and La Preaux, let them look to themselves.\" \"Nay! nay! That is madness. If they are taken ere we are safe they will divulge all. To save ourselves we must save them.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1613/47777.html","bookId":1236,"book":{"id":1236,"title":"Traitor and True","description":"简介： The doors of the Taverne Gabrielle, in the Rue des Franc Bourgeois in the Marais, stood open to all passers-by, and also to the cool wind blowing from the south-east.
