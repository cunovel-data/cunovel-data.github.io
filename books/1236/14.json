{"id":9818,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV","content":"\"Le Dédaigneux!\" Humphrey said to himself. \"Le Dédaigneux. Some man, some great one masquerading under a sobriquet, a nom de guerre! Who can it be but one! Who but the one whose proud family motto almost speaks of their disdain for even kings; whose own life bespeaks his scorn for all who are not of his blood; who looks down on other men as other men look down on the insects crawling in their path! Who can it be but he? Yet--does he lead these conspirators or is he led by them? Is he their chief or cat\u0027s-paw? I must know that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen,\" he heard Van den Enden saying now. \"Briefly, all that is devised is as follows.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Those men, that money, and the Dutch Fleet are in our hands, at our service,\" Van den Enden continued next; \"the moment that your Normandy is prepared to rise against this tyrant whose tyranny is greater than was the tyranny of Richelieu, of Mazarin, or of both combined. If your chiefs, your great noblesse, your merchants of Rouen, Havre and other cities--all groaning under this tyrant\u0027s unjust taxation of them, specially for his wars; all hating his wantons, his mad extravagance and love of splendour--are ready to rise and form themselves into a Republic which shall at last be a Republic formed of the whole of France, then the Spaniards and Hollanders are ready to play their part.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Republics have heads, dictators, rulers, as well as monarchies. Men who are yet monarchs though without crowns, or thrones, or rights hereditary. Whom does Spain produce?\" La Truaumont asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"De Montérey at first stipulated for the head of the house of--Le Dédaigneux. The Duke----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah!\" whispered Humphrey to himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But finding that this might not be, that the Duke refuses since he would have to throw too heavy a stake to win even so great a prize as this, they will accept him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They must,\" the listener heard the woman say. \"He must be head or nothing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They have agreed,\" Van den Enden continued. \"They desire Quillebeuf, De Montérey avers, more than all the places of which Le Roi Soleil has despoiled them. They wish to form a Republic rivalling that of Venice, one that, in being with them, shall crush all who are against them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And Louis! The King. What of him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen. His guards have been dispatched to join the army. Le Dédaigneux as their colonel has taken care of that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My God!\" Humphrey whispered to himself. \"He is in it. The chief conspirator and no tool!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The King will,\" Van den Enden went on, \"be either at St. Germain or Fontainebleau for the next few weeks or months. And then--then----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then?\" said La Truaumont. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then five hundred Norman gentlemen will subdue the courtiers and seize on him. We shall have him. Hold him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go on!\" La Truaumont muttered, his voice husky and deep. \"What next? What will you do with him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He will sign a renunciation of his throne or----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Or?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He will go to the Bastille, or Pignerol--Pignerol is safer; it is afar off, out of, lost to, the world. He will experience that which he has caused countless others to experience. And, later, he will--die.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Die! How?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As others have died,\" the Jew hissed. \"As all die who suffer under his tyranny. By his own hands, or--will--appear--to have done so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My horse is in its stall,\" Humphrey thought to himself now; \"my rapier to my hand. It is time, and full time, too, for me to be on my way. On my way to France--thank heaven the frontier is so near at hand! To Paris, to the King. There is no time to lose. The King to be seized and, later, the country invaded; the fortresses taken! And I know all the scheme. All, as well as the names of all concerned.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yet,\" he went on, \"I must contain myself longer. To leave this room now, however softly; to attempt to unbar the door of this closed house, if it is yet shut; to saddle \u0027Soupir\u0027 and ride off now is to tell those wretches in there that they are blown upon. I must wait--wait till full night has come, till midnight at earliest, or even until later and, then, off and away. Away through the mountains, over the plains--on--on--till I stand face to face with the King and tell him all. Heaven above be praised, he knows me and my name: he has befriended me and been good to my mother. It will not be hard to do. Oh! that I could creep out now, at once, so as to waste no precious moment.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For an instant, as thus he communed with himself, there had come to him a thought that he would endeavour to communicate with the Duchess by tapping gently on the door that was between their rooms; by attracting the attention of her or Jacquette, both of whom were probably at supper now in their salon; and by stealing away in that manner. But no sooner had this idea come to him than it was discarded. The tapping, or scratching, he must make to call their attention to him would equally summon the attention of those in that other room, and might, indeed, reach their ears sooner than it would reach the ears of the others whose notice he desired to attract. No! he must stay quiet until, at least, those in the next room had separated, which, judging by the words he had heard the once unknown voice utter to the effect that La Truaumont and his party should be abed before ten--would undoubtedly not be long now. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile, as these reflections passed through his mind his ears were still on the alert; even as he thought, so he could listen, too, and not only hear but grasp what was the subject of conversation between the conspirators in that room. \\n\\n \\n\\n From the absolute conspiracy itself the talk had now wandered to other matters, and at this moment Humphrey heard La Truaumont say:-- \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ride with this heroine of romance--this folle who is covered with jewels but, sangdieu! will not have more than a change of linen with her--as far as Martigny. There I shall be taken with sudden illness, the vapours, the falling sickness--the megrims--one will do as well as t\u0027other, and so I shall be left behind. And then, when they are gone, hey! for France, for Normandy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A moment later, the opening and shutting gently of the door was heard by Humphrey; a stealthy though heavy tread in the corridor was also apparent to the young man\u0027s ears: he knew, he felt sure he knew, that the man had left the room. The plot was laid bare by Van den Enden, the meeting over. \\n\\n \\n\\n The other two in that room continued, however, to remain in it, and more than once Humphrey heard the rasping tones of the voice which he felt sure belonged to the old man who had descended from the French coach, and the softer, sweeter ones of the woman who inhabited those apartments and, as far as he knew, never stirred out of them. But, though he heard the tones, the words that were uttered were now unintelligible, and it flashed instantly into Humphrey\u0027s mind that the pair were whispering to each other. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whispering,\" he said to himself. \"Whispering! Yet why now, when the worst is told and has been told openly and, beyond uncertainty, without fear of that worst being overheard? Why have the two to speak in whispers now since, when they were three, they said nothing that--as they thought--needed suppression?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He heard, however, something further. He heard shuffling feet which, Humphrey did not doubt, were the feet of the old man moving about the room; a piece of furniture--a chair as it seemed to him--moved from one part of the apartment to another; a smooth, rubbing sound on the other side of the wainscot against which he leant with his head beneath the folds of the frouzy, dusty tapestry, and once--or twice--a word or the fragments of a question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you sure? Certain? It is death if so,\" the rasping, or feeble, voice asked, not in one sentence but in three exclamations, while the clearer, more fresh voice replied, also interjectedly. \"Service, I tell you. Safe. Covered. Impossible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n To what these words might refer Humphrey could not conceive, no more than he could conceive to what those various movements in the room applied. Neither could he form any opinion as to the meaning of what he next heard clearly and distinctly, since, forgetting himself for the moment, the man said:-- \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No chance if that is done. The swiftest portion of the Rhine is quickly reached by that brawling, rushing river outside. I know, I have been a refugee in this city ere now--and then, once there, the secret is hidden for ever. The swirl at that spot is worse than the grave, since the latter can be made to give up its dead or what is left of them, but it never.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Of this speech Humphrey could understand nothing; it conveyed naught to his mind. Or, if it did convey anything, only the thought that some proof of their secret, something which he could not guess at or surmise, was to be consigned to an eternal and unyielding oblivion. \\n\\n \\n\\n It seemed as if, now, those two were about to separate for the night. In still broken, still interjected sentences and scraps of sentences and stray words, Humphrey could understand that they were telling each other their future plans. He gathered that the woman had promised to set out the next day in her coach for Paris, that she would wait at Mülhausen till the French coach from Basle arrived when she would take her confederate into her own carriage and convey him with her. He also found out for certainty what the old man\u0027s name was. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will not have you masquerading as my father,\" he heard the woman whisper. \"You need be no longer the Seigneur de Chateaugrand. Your own name of Van den Enden will do very well, since nothing connects you with us or Normandy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It will do very well for me, too,\" Humphrey said to himself, \"since I know both of them now. And yours also, my lady, thanks to your chattering maid and your travelling necessaries.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A moment later he once more heard the door opened and shut, gently as ever, and knew that the woman was left alone. Still another moment, and he heard her cross the floor of her salon and knew by the sound of a closing door--the different sound made by a different door--that she had entered another room, the one in which she doubtless slept. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was now ten o\u0027clock, as Humphrey heard plainly from all the various clocks in the city, and he knew that he must, as yet, have no thought of setting out for France. By the absence of all movement whatever in the Duchess\u0027s room to the right he recognised that she had not yet sought her bed; he heard, too, all the sounds rising up the stairs from the ground portion of the inn which told him that there was as yet no likelihood of the place being closed for the night. There were, he knew well, no other travellers, or at least none of importance, staying in the house, yet--even in this rigid and now harsh and severe Protestant city that, nearly a hundred years after Calvin\u0027s death, had not yet shaken off the gloomy asceticism with which he had dyed and imbued it, as well as Geneva and others--there were wassailers and carousers who came here to drink nightly. He had seen them and heard them, too, the evening before, as, also, he had seen Fleur de Mai and Boisfleury drinking with them. He knew, also, that until midnight, or at least as long as the landlord would allow them to remain, which was so long as they would drink and sup, the house would not be closed and these topers sent forth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Therefore,\" thought Humphrey, \"I must possess my soul in patience. There is naught else for it.\" Though, even as he so thought, there came another reflection to his mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Foregad!\" he said to himself, \"if I stay in here until the house is closed, I am as like not to be unable to leave it. Therefore let me consider what is best. Either to quit the house before it is shut up for the night, to get to the stables and remain in them till all is quiet and then steal away on \u0027Soupir\u0027--she is fleet of foot and, once off, none will catch us!--or wait here till all are gone to their beds and take my chance of finding an exit? Which shall I do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly, however, he made his final decision. To stay here and risk being unable to obtain that exit was folly. Better walk about the streets for hours and then return and make his way to the stables and obtain his horse--if the stables were not themselves made fast for the night--than stay here to be shut in till the morning. Consequently, he decided he would go in an hour\u0027s time if not sooner. And, also, it might be best that then, if he could get into the stables, he should saddle \"Soupir,\" at once, lead her out gently, and, mounting her without delay, ride forth out of the town. That he would have to pass the gate he knew, but, with the passport he carried in his pocket signed by D\u0027Argenson for the King--the King whom, if possible, he went forth to warn and save--this would be easy. \\n\\n \\n\\n So that he should make no noise which might inform the woman he was there, if at any minute she should return to the room next to him, he took off his long boots and walked softly about seeking the few necessaries which he must take with him: to wit, his rapier, his pistols and cloak and hat. The other things he had with him, which were contained in the little valise for strapping in front of the saddle, he would leave behind. Jacquette, he knew, would understand in the morning, when he was found to be missing, that he had purposely left them and would see that they were placed in safe custody, while, even if she did not do so, their loss would be no serious thing. \\n\\n \\n\\n Humphrey went to the door now, turning the key back as softly as might be so as to make no noise, and, next, took it from the inside and inserted it in the lock on the outside and pushed the door-to without shutting it, after which he drew his boots on once more and crept softly out. Then he locked the door and, dropping the key into his pocket, descended the stairs. \\n\\n \\n\\n He met no one on them and, so far as he knew, no one saw him. The landlord was not in his room, as he could see through the glass window giving on to the passage: the door of the great general room was shut, though from it there issued a hum of voices, above all of which he could distinguish the loud boasting tones of Fleur de Mai as, doubtless, he indulged in some of his usual rhodomontades. Likewise, and he thanked heaven for it, the street door still stood wide open as though inviting custom. To add to his satisfaction the oil-lamp in the passage was extinct, it having probably been blown out by the warm southerly breeze that had arisen with the coming of the night. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All is very well,\" Humphrey said to himself. \"Yet a few moments more and \u0027Soupir\u0027 and I shall be on our road for Paris. Then, catch who can.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he stepped out on to the place between the inn and the river. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1613/47771.html","bookId":1236,"book":{"id":1236,"title":"Traitor and True","description":"简介： The doors of the Taverne Gabrielle, in the Rue des Franc Bourgeois in the Marais, stood open to all passers-by, and also to the cool wind blowing from the south-east.
