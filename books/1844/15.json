She said thank-you to Alex, Gowrie, and Brodick as they filed past her. They reacted in the very same manner. They were abrupt, distant.\\n\\n Judith told herself she shouldn\u0027t have expected anything more. They\u0027d done their duty and were finally rid of her. She held on to her smile and turned around. As she was passing a group of women, she heard one whisper, \"Dear God, I\u0027m thinking she\u0027s English, but that can\u0027t be, can it?\" If Judith\u0027s clothing hadn\u0027t given her away, she knew her accent certainly had.\\n\\n She continued to walk toward Frances Catherine, but smiled at the women gawking at her. \"Aye, I am English.\"\\n\\n One woman\u0027s mouth actually dropped open. Judith suppressed the urge to laugh, because she felt it would be terribly rude to show amusement over someone else\u0027s obvious distress.\\n\\n When she reached her friend, she said, \"Everyone seems quite thrilled to have my company.\"\\n\\n Frances Catherine laughed. Patrick reacted in just the opposite way. He evidently thought she\u0027d been serious when she made that remark. \"Judith, I don\u0027t believe thrilled is the proper word. Actually, I would wager they\u0027re…\"\\n\\n He looked at his wife for help in softening the truth. Frances Catherine didn\u0027t give him any assistance, however. She couldn\u0027t quit laughing.\\n\\n Judith smiled up at Patrick. \"Would \u0027appalled\u0027 be a better word?\"\\n\\n \"Nay,\" Frances Catherine said. \"Outraged, disgusted, or perhaps—\"\\n\\n \"Enough,\" Patrick interrupted with a low growl. The sparkle in his eyes indicated he wasn\u0027t really angry.\\n\\n \"Then you were jesting with me when you suggested—\"\\n\\n Judith nodded. \"Yes, I was jesting. I know I\u0027m not welcome here. Iain warned me.\"\\n\\n Before Patrick could comment on that remark, an elderly warrior called out to him. He bowed to Frances Catherine and Judith, then walked over to the cluster of men standing near the steps to the keep. Frances Catherine linked her arm through Judith\u0027s and started walking down the slope.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be staying with Patrick and me,\" she explained. \"It might be a little cramped but I want you close by.\"\\n\\n \"Is there more than one room in this cottage?\"\\n\\n \"No. Patrick wants to add another after the baby\u0027s born.\"\\n\\n Patrick came down the hill to join them. The frown on his face made Judith believe he\u0027d already had to defend her presence to the warriors.\\n\\n \"Is it going to be difficult for you, Patrick, because you invited me to come here?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t give her a direct answer. \"They\u0027ll become accustomed to having you around.\"\\n\\n They reached the cottage. It was the first along the pathway. Flowers bordered the front of their home, some pink, others red, and the stone had been thoroughly whitewashed until it was pristine clean.\\n\\n There was a wide square window on each side of the door. The interior was just as inviting as the exterior. A stone hearth took up the center of one wall. A large bed covered with a beautiful multicolored quilt was positioned against the opposite wall, and a round table surrounded by six stools took up the rest of the space. The washstand was near the door.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll bring a cot inside before nightfall,\" Frances Catherine promised.\\n\\n Patrick nodded agreement, but he didn\u0027t look very happy about the arrangement. Nay, he looked resigned.\\n\\n It was a delicate topic, but one that needed to be settled as soon as possible. Judith went over to the table and sat down. \"Patrick, please don\u0027t leave yet,\" she called out when he started back out the doorway. \"I would like to talk to you about this sleeping arrangement.\"\\n\\n He turned, leaned against the door, folded his arms across his chest and waited for her to explain. He thought she was going to suggest that he find someplace else to stay while she was there, and he was already preparing himself for his wife\u0027s disappointment when he told Judith no. Although it wasn\u0027t possible to be physically intimate with Frances Catherine now, he still enjoyed holding her close during the night, and by God, he wasn\u0027t going to give that up.\\n\\n Unless Frances Catherine got all teary-eyed on him again, Patrick admitted. He\u0027d give up anything just to ease her distress.\\n\\n Judith was taken aback by the intense frown Patrick was giving her. Frances Catherine\u0027s husband was turning out to be as gruff-natured as Iain was. She still liked him, of course, and all because she could tell from the way he watched his wife that he loved her.\\n\\n She folded her hands together. \"I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s appropriate for me to stay with you. You both should have your privacy each night,\" she added in a rush when Frances Catherine looked like she was going to argue. \"Please don\u0027t take offense,\" she said. \"But I think a husband and wife should have time alone. Isn\u0027t there someplace I could stay that\u0027s close by?\"\\n\\n Frances Catherine was vehemently shaking her head when Patrick spoke up. \"The cottage two down is empty. It\u0027s smaller than ours, but I\u0027m certain it would do.\"\\n\\n \"Patrick, I want her to stay with us.\"\\n\\n \"She just explained she doesn\u0027t want to, love. Let her have her way.\"\\n\\n Judith was embarrassed. \"It isn\u0027t that I don\u0027t want to stay—\"\\n\\n \"There, do you see? She does want to—\"\\n\\n \"Frances Catherine, I\u0027m going to win this argument,\" Judith announced. She nodded to her friend when she made that prediction.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s my turn,\" she explained. \"You may win the next argument.\"\\n\\n \"Lord, you\u0027re stubborn. All right. You may stay in Elmont\u0027s cottage. I\u0027ll help you make it comfortable.\"\\n\\n \"You will not,\" Patrick interjected. \"You\u0027re going to rest, wife. I\u0027ll see to your friend\u0027s comfort.\"\\n\\n Patrick was looking much happier now. Judith guessed he was relieved she was going to be sleeping somewhere else. He even smiled at her. She smiled back. \"I do assume Elmont isn\u0027t living there anymore and won\u0027t mind.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s dead,\" Patrick told her. \"He isn\u0027t going to mind at all.\"\\n\\n Frances Catherine shook her head at her husband. He winked at her, then left the cottage. \"My husband didn\u0027t mean to sound so callous, but Elmont was very old when he died, and his passing was peaceful. Patrick was just making a little jest. I think he\u0027s taken with you, Judith.\"\\n\\n \"You love him very much, don\u0027t you, Frances Catherine?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" her friend answered. She sat down at the table and spent a good hour talking about her husband. She told Judith how they\u0027d met, how he relentlessly pursued her, and finished by mentioning just a hundred or two of his special qualities.\\n\\n The only thing the man wasn\u0027t capable of was walking on water… yet. Judith made that comment when her friend paused for breath.\\n\\n Frances Catherine laughed. \"I\u0027m so happy you\u0027re here.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have hurt feelings because I want to sleep somewhere else?\"\\n\\n \"No, of course not. Besides, you\u0027ll be close enough to hear me shout if there\u0027s need. I must be careful not to exclude Patrick. My husband does get his feelings hurt quite easily if he thinks I\u0027m not paying him enough attention.\"\\n\\n Judith tried not to laugh. Patrick was such a big brute of a man. The idea that he could have injured feelings was vastly amusing, and terribly sweet.\\n\\n \"He looks like his brother.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps just a little,\" Frances Catherine agreed. \"Patrick\u0027s much more handsome, though.\"\\n\\n Judith was of the opinion that it was really just the opposite. Iain was much better-looking than Patrick was. Love really must color one\u0027s perception, she decided.\\n\\n \"Patrick\u0027s incredibly gentle and loving.\"\\n\\n \"So is Iain,\" Judith remarked before she could stop herself.\\n\\n Her friend immediately latched on to that comment. \"And how would you know if Iain\u0027s loving or not?\"\\n\\n \"He kissed me.\" She\u0027d whispered that confession, felt herself blush, and immediately lowered her gaze. \"Twice.\"\\n\\n Frances Catherine was stunned. \"Did you kiss him back… twice?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\"\\n\\n Judith shook her head. \"No, you don\u0027t see,\" she argued. \"We were attracted to each other. I\u0027m not at all certain why, but it doesn\u0027t really matter. The attraction\u0027s over now. Really,\" she added when she saw her friend\u0027s reaction.\\n\\n Frances Catherine didn\u0027t believe her. She was shaking her head. \"I know why he was attracted to you,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n Frances Catherine rolled her eyes heavenward. \"Honest to God, you don\u0027t have a bit of vanity inside you. Don\u0027t you ever see yourself in the looking glass? You\u0027re beautiful, Judith.\" She paused to let out a dramatic sigh. \"No one\u0027s ever taken the time to tell you that.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not true,\" Judith argued. \"Millicent and Herbert gave me plenty of compliments. They let me know how much they loved me.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Frances Catherine agreed. \"But the one you most needed acceptance from turned her back on you.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t start in, Frances Catherine,\" Judith warned. \"Mother can\u0027t help the way she is.\"\\n\\n Frances Catherine snorted. \"Is Tekel still roaring drunk every night?\"\\n\\n Judith nodded. \"He\u0027s drinking during the day now, too,\" she said.\\n\\n \"What do you suppose would have happened to you if you hadn\u0027t had your aunt Millicent and uncle Herbert protecting you when you were so young and vulnerable? I think about such things now that I\u0027m expecting my own child.\"\\n\\n Judith didn\u0027t know what to say to those remarks. Her silence told her friend to ease up.\\n\\n \"Did you have difficulty leaving?\" Frances Catherine asked. \"I worried because I knew you would probably be at Tekel\u0027s holding. You always have to stay with him for six months at a time, and I couldn\u0027t remember exactly when you would move back. I\u0027ve been fretting over it.\"\\n\\n \"I was with Tekel but I didn\u0027t have any trouble leaving,\" Judith replied. \"Mother had already left for London and the king\u0027s court.\"\\n\\n \"And Tekel?\"\\n\\n \"He was sotted when I told him where I was going. I\u0027m not certain he even remembered the next morning. Millicent and Herbert will tell him again if there\u0027s need.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t want to talk about her family any longer. There was such sadness in Frances Catherine\u0027s eyes, and Judith was determined to find out the reason.\\n\\n \"Are you feeling well? When is the baby due to arrive?\"\\n\\n \"I feel fat,\" Frances Catherine answered. \"And I\u0027m guessing I have about eight or nine more weeks before it\u0027s time.\"\\n\\n Judith took hold of her friend\u0027s hand. \"Tell me what\u0027s wrong.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t have to explain that gentle order. Her friend understood what she was asking. \"If it weren\u0027t for Patrick, I would hate it here.\"\\n\\n The vehemence in Frances Catherine\u0027s voice told Judith she wasn\u0027t exaggerating her misery. \"Do you miss your father and your brothers?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" she answered. \"All the time.\"\\n\\n \"Then ask Patrick to go and fetch them for a nice long visitation.\"\\n\\n Frances Catherine shook her head. \"I can\u0027t ask for anything more,\" she whispered. \"We had to go to the council to get permission for you to come here.\"\\n\\n With Judith\u0027s prodding, she explained all about the council\u0027s power. She told Judith how Iain had interfered when the oligarchy was getting ready to deny her request, and how frightened she\u0027d been during the entire ordeal.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand why you would have to go through the council to get permission,\" Judith remarked. \"Even though I\u0027m English, I still don\u0027t see the need to have their approval.\"\\n\\n \"Most of the Maitlands have good reason to dislike the English,\" Frances Catherine explained. \"They\u0027ve lost family and friends in battles against the English. They hate your King John, too.\"\\n\\n Judith lifted her shoulders in a shrug. \" \u0027Tis the truth most of the barons in England dislike the king.\" She resisted the urge to make the sign of the cross so she wouldn\u0027t burn in purgatory for defaming her overlord. \"He\u0027s self-serving and has made some terrible mistakes, at least that\u0027s what Uncle Herbert tells me.\"\\n\\n \"Did you know your king was pledged to marry a Scot and then changed his mind?\"\\n\\n \"I hadn\u0027t heard, but I\u0027m not surprised. Frances Catherine, what did you mean when you said you couldn\u0027t ask Patrick for anything more? Why can\u0027t he fetch your father?\"\\n\\n \"The Maitlands don\u0027t like outsiders,\" she answered. \"They don\u0027t like me either.\"\\n\\n She sounded like a child when she blurted out that remark. Judith thought that perhaps her delicate condition was the reason for her emotional turmoil. \"I\u0027m just as certain everyone likes you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not making this up in my mind,\" she argued. \"The women think I\u0027m spoiled and accustomed to having my own way.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n \"One of the midwives told me so.\" Tears started down Frances Catherine\u0027s cheeks. She wiped them away with the backs of her hands. \"I\u0027m so scared inside. I\u0027ve been scared for you, too. I knew it was selfish of me to ask you to come here.\"\\n\\n \"I gave you my word years ago that I would come,\" Judith reminded her. \"I would have been hurt if you hadn\u0027t sent for me. Don\u0027t talk such nonsense.\"\\n\\n \"But the promise I made you give me… that was before I knew I\u0027d end up here,\" she stammered out. \"These people are so… cold. I worried they might offend you.\"\\n\\n Judith smiled. How like her friend to be so concerned about her well-being. \"Frances Catherine, have you always felt like this or did you begin to hate it here after you found out you were expecting?\"\\n\\n Her friend had to consider the question a long minute. \"I was happy at first, but it soon became clear to me I didn\u0027t fit in. I feel like an outsider. I\u0027ve been married for over three years now and they still don\u0027t consider me a Maitland.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps because I was raised on the border,\" she answered. \"At least that might be part of their reasoning. Patrick was supposed to marry someone else. He hadn\u0027t offered for her, but it was assumed he would. Then he met me.\"\\n\\n \"Have you discussed your unhappiness with Patrick?\"\\n\\n \"I did mention it a few times,\" she said. \"My unhappiness was very upsetting. My husband can\u0027t make the women like me. I don\u0027t want to die here. I wish Patrick would take me back to Papa before the birthing and stay with me until it\u0027s over.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-15.html","bookId":1844,"book":{"id":1844,"title":"The Secret (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #1)","description":"Storyline: Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud, as purposeful as she was loyal.
