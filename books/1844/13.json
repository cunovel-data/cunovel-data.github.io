He destroyed the cocoon in seconds.\\n\\n \"That helped,\" she muttered. She sat up so she could glare at him.\\n\\n Iain pushed her back and stretched out on the ground beside her. He rested on his side, giving her the heat from his back.\\n\\n Brodick suddenly appeared on her other side. He stretched out on his side with his back toward her. Judith instinctively wiggled closer to Iain. Brodick followed her, until his back was pressed against hers.\\n\\n She was certainly warm enough now. The heat radiating from the giant warriors was amazing.\\n\\n It felt wonderful.\\n\\n \"She feels like a block of ice,\" Brodick remarked.\\n\\n Judith started laughing. The sound made both Iain and Brodick smile.\\n\\n \"Brodick?\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n He sounded mean again. She didn\u0027t let that bother her. She was finally catching on to his ways, and knew the bluster was all for show. Underneath that gruff exterior beat a kind heart. \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"What for?\"\\n\\n \"For taking the time to talk about Isabelle.\"\\n\\n The warrior grunted. She laughed again.\\n\\n \"Judith?\"\\n\\n She snuggled closer to Iain\u0027s back before answering him. \"Yes, Iain?\"\\n\\n \"Quit wiggling and go to sleep.\"\\n\\n She felt like obeying him. She fell asleep almost immediately.\\n\\n A long while passed before Brodick spoke again. He wanted to be certain Judith really was asleep and wouldn\u0027t hear what he was going to say. \"Each time she\u0027s given a choice, she turns to you.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027s that, Brodick?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s glued to your back now, not mine. She prefers riding with you, too. Didn\u0027t you notice the pitiful expression on her face when you made her ride with Alex today? She looked damn forlorn.\"\\n\\n Iain smiled. \"I noticed,\" he admitted. \"But if she prefers me, it\u0027s only because I\u0027m Patrick\u0027s brother.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a hell of a lot more to it than that.\"\\n\\n Iain didn\u0027t respond to that comment.\\n\\n Several minutes passed before Brodick spoke again. \"Let me know, Iain.\"\\n\\n \"Let you know what?\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re going to keep her or not.\"\\n\\n \"And if I\u0027m not?\"\\n\\n \"Then I am.\"\\n\\n Chapter 5\\n\\n It took two more days to reach the Maitland holding. They spent the last night in a beautiful forest called Glennden Falls. Birch, pine, and oak trees were so thick in the area, the horses could barely get through the narrow path. A mist, more white than gray, and nearly waist high in some spots, floated around the greenery, giving an air of magic to the paradise.\\n\\n Judith was enchanted. She walked into the mist until it completely surrounded her. Iain watched her. She turned around, caught him staring at her, and whispered in a voice filled with awe that this was surely the most beautiful spot in all the world.\\n\\n \"This is what I envision Heaven to be, Iain,\" she told him.\\n\\n He seemed surprised, took a good look around him, and then, in his arrogant way, said, \"Perhaps.\"\\n\\n It was evident the man had never taken the time to appreciate the beauty around him. She told him so. He gave her a long, thorough look that started at the top of her head and ended at the tips of her boots. He moved forward, gently touched the side of her face, and then said, \"I\u0027m noticing all right.\"\\n\\n She could feel herself blushing. He was referring to her, of course. Did he truly find her beautiful? She was too embarrassed to ask. He turned her attention, however, with his announcement that she could have a proper bath.\\n\\n She was thrilled. The water cascading down the gentle slope was frigid, but she was too happy to have the opportunity to thoroughly scrub herself to mind the cold. She even washed her hair. She had to braid it damp, but that didn\u0027t bother her, either.\\n\\n She wanted to look her best when she was reunited with her friend. Judith was a little apprehensive about seeing Frances Catherine again. It had been almost four years since their last visit. Would her friend think she\u0027d changed very much… and if so, would she think the changes were for the better or the worse?\\n\\n Judith didn\u0027t allow herself to fret over the reunion long. In her heart she knew it would be all right. Her excitement grew as soon as she pushed the silly worry aside, and by the time they\u0027d finished their supper, she was literally pacing around the campfire.\\n\\n \"Did you know Cameron\u0027s wife stayed up all night cooking for us?\" she asked no one in particular. \"She sent Isabelle her favorite sweet biscuits, but she made enough for us as well.\"\\n\\n Alex, Gowrie, and Brodick were all sitting around the fire. Iain leaned against a fat birch, watching her. No one replied to her comments about Margaret.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t daunted. Nothing could dampen her enthusiasm. \"Why do we have a fire tonight? We haven\u0027t had one before,\" she remarked.\\n\\n Gowrie answered her. \"We\u0027re on Maitland land now. We weren\u0027t before.\"\\n\\n She let out a gasp. \"This wonderland belongs to you?\"\\n\\n Alex and Gowrie both smiled. Brodick frowned. \"Will you quit your pacing, woman? You\u0027re making my head ache watching you.\"\\n\\n She threw Brodick a smile when she strolled past him. \"Then don\u0027t watch,\" she suggested.\\n\\n She wanted to nudge his temper a bit, but he surprised her with a grin.\\n\\n \"Why are you pacing?\" Iain asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m too excited about tomorrow to sit still. It\u0027s been a long while since I\u0027ve seen Frances Catherine, and I have so many things I want to tell her. My mind\u0027s cluttered with them. I wager I won\u0027t be able to sleep a wink tonight.\"\\n\\n Iain secretly wagered she would. He won. Judith was dead to the world as soon as she closed her eyes.\\n\\n When morning arrived, she refused to be rushed. She warned them she was going to take her time, and when she returned to the camp where Iain and the others impatiently waited on horseback for her, she looked as magical as her surroundings. She was dressed in a brilliant blue gown that perfectly matched the dramatic color of her eyes. Her hair was unbound, and the thick curls floated around her shoulders when she moved.\\n\\n A tightness settled in Iain\u0027s chest. He couldn\u0027t seem to take his gaze away from her. His lack of discipline appalled him. He shook his head over his own shameful behavior and scowled at the woman driving him to distraction.\\n\\n Judith reached the clearing and then stopped. Iain didn\u0027t understand why she was hesitating until he turned and noticed his men had all extended their hands to her. Each was beckoning her forward.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s riding with me.\"\\n\\n His voice didn\u0027t suggest anyone argue. She thought he was irritated because she\u0027d taken so long to get ready this morning.\\n\\n She slowly made her way over to his side. \"I did warn you I\u0027d need more time today, so you really don\u0027t have anything to frown about.\"\\n\\n He let out a sigh. \"It isn\u0027t ladylike to speak to me in that tone,\" he explained.\\n\\n Her eyes widened. \"What tone?\"\\n\\n \"Demanding.\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t demanding.\"\\n\\n \"You really shouldn\u0027t argue with me, either.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t even try to hide her exasperation. Her hands settled on the sides of her hips. \"Iain, I understand that because you\u0027re laird, you\u0027re used to ordering people around. However—\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t get to finish her explanation. He leaned down, grabbed her around the waist, and lifted her up into his lap. She let out a yelp. He hadn\u0027t hurt her, though. Nay, it was his amazing quickness that caught her off guard.\\n\\n \"You and I are going to have to come to some sort of understanding,\" he announced in a hard, no nonsense tone of voice.\\n\\n He turned to his companions. \"Go ahead,\" he ordered. \"We\u0027ll catch up.\"\\n\\n While he waited until his men had left, she tried to turn in his lap so she would be facing the front. He squeezed her around the waist, a silent message to stay where she was.\\n\\n She pinched his arm to get him to let up on his hold. He watched his men take their leave, waiting for privacy so he could speak to her without being overheard, but he did let up on his grip. She immediately quit squirming.\\n\\n She turned to look up at him. He hadn\u0027t shaved this morning. He looked a little disheveled and very, very masculine.\\n\\n Abruptly, he turned his full attention to her. They stared into each other\u0027s eyes a long minute. He wondered how in God\u0027s name he was ever going to be able to leave her alone once they reached his home. She wondered how he\u0027d come by such a fine, unblemished profile. She turned her attention to his mouth. She couldn\u0027t seem to catch her breath. Heaven help her, she really wanted to be kissed.\\n\\n He wanted to kiss her. He took a deep breath in an effort to control his wayward thoughts. \"Judith, this attraction between us is probably due to the fact that we\u0027ve been forced to endure each other\u0027s company for over a week now. The closeness—\"\\n\\n She took immediate exception to his poor choice of words. \"You feel you\u0027ve been forced to endure my company?\"\\n\\n He ignored her interruption. \"When we reach the holding, everything will change, of course. There\u0027s a specific chain of command, and everyone in the Maitland clan adheres to the same rules.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"So there won\u0027t be chaos.\"\\n\\n He waited for her to nod before continuing. He was trying not to look at her sweet mouth.\\n\\n \"The rule we all follow… or rather, the chain of command, was put aside during this journey for necessity\u0027s sake, but once we reach our destination, we will not have such an unstructured relationship.\"\\n\\n He paused again. She assumed he was waiting for her agreement. She dutifully nodded. He looked relieved until she asked, \"Why is that?\"\\n\\n He let out a sigh. \"Because I\u0027m laird.\"\\n\\n \"I already knew you were laird,\" she replied. \"And I\u0027m certain you\u0027re a fine one, too. Still, I do wonder what this talk is about. I believe I mentioned before, I\u0027m not a member of your clan.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m certain I explained that while you\u0027re a guest on my land, you\u0027ll obey the same rules as everyone else.\"\\n\\n She patted his arm. \"You\u0027re still worried I\u0027ll cause trouble, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n He suddenly felt like throttling her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m really going to try to get along with everyone,\" she whispered. \"I won\u0027t make any problems.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"I\u0027m not certain that\u0027s possible. As soon as they realize you\u0027re English, their minds will be set against you.\"\\n\\n \"That isn\u0027t fair, is it?\"\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t in the mood to argue with her. \"Fairness isn\u0027t the issue. I\u0027m simply trying to prepare you. When everyone gets over their initial surprise—\"\\n\\n \"Do you mean to tell me no one knows I\u0027m coming?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t interrupt me when I\u0027m speaking to you,\" he commanded.\\n\\n She patted his arm again. \"I do beg your pardon,\" she whispered.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t sound the least bit contrite to him. He let out a sigh. \"Patrick, Frances Catherine, and the council members know you\u0027re coming. The others will find out when you get there. Judith, I don\u0027t want you to have a difficult… adjustment.\"\\n\\n He was truly worried about her. And trying to hide his concern with a gruff voice and a hard frown. \"You\u0027re a very kind man,\" she said, her voice husky with emotion.\\n\\n He acted as though she\u0027d insulted him. \"The hell I am.\"\\n\\n Judith decided then and there she was never going to understand him. She brushed her hair back over her shoulder, let out a sigh, and then said, \"Exactly what are you so concerned about? Do you think they\u0027ll find me inferior?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps, at first,\" he began. \"But once—\"\\n\\n She interrupted him again. \"That attitude won\u0027t bother me. I\u0027ve been considered inferior before. Nay, it won\u0027t bother me at all. My feelings won\u0027t be so easily injured. Do quit worrying about me, please.\"\\n\\n He shook his head at her. \"Aye, your feelings will get injured,\" he countered, remembering the look on her face when his men hadn\u0027t immediately sat down with her to eat her supper that first night. He paused, trying to remember what he wanted to tell her, then said in a near shout, \"Who the hell thinks you\u0027re inferior?\"\\n\\n \"My mother,\" she answered before she thought better of it. \"I\u0027m not in the mood to talk about my family,\" she added with a firm nod. \"Shouldn\u0027t we get started?\"\\n\\n \"Judith, I\u0027m merely trying to tell you that if you should run into any substantial problems, tell Patrick. My brother will find me.\"\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t I simply tell you? Why must I involve Frances Catherine\u0027s husband?\"\\n\\n \"The chain of command—\" Her sudden smile stopped him cold. \"Why are you amused?\"\\n\\n She lifted her shoulders in a dainty shrug. \"I\u0027m pleased to know you\u0027re concerned about me.\"\\n\\n \"How I feel about you has nothing to do with this discussion,\" he told her, his voice downright mean. He was being deliberately harsh because he wanted her to understand the importance of what he was telling her. Damn it, he was trying to protect her from hurt. Women had such fragile feelings, if Patrick\u0027s comments were to be taken seriously, and he didn\u0027t want Judith upset. He wanted her adjustment to be as peaceful as possible, and he knew that if she didn\u0027t behave in an appropriate manner, the members of the clan would make her life miserable. Her every movement would be scrutinized. Judith had been correct. The immediate dislike wasn\u0027t fair. How like an innocent to think in such terms. Iain was a realist, however, and knew that fair didn\u0027t matter. Survival did. He was almost overwhelmed by his need to protect her any way he knew how, and if that meant intimidating her to get her to understand her tenuous position, then by God he would intimidate.\\n\\n \"I really don\u0027t care for the way you\u0027re frowning at me, Iain. I haven\u0027t done anything wrong.\"\\n\\n He closed his eyes in surrender. She couldn\u0027t be intimidated. Lord, he felt like laughing. \"Talking to you is an extremely trying experience,\" he remarked.\\n\\n \"Because I\u0027m an outsider or because I\u0027m a woman?\"\\n\\n \"Both, I suppose,\" he answered. \"I haven\u0027t had much experience conversing with many women.\"\\n\\n Her eyes widened in disbelief. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"It hasn\u0027t been necessary,\" he explained.\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t believe what he was telling her. \"You make it sound like a chore.\"\\n\\n He grinned. \"It is.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d probably just insulted her, but she didn\u0027t mind. His smile softened the comment. \"Aren\u0027t there women at home who you enjoy talking to on occasion?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-13.html","bookId":1844,"book":{"id":1844,"title":"The Secret (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #1)","description":"Storyline: Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud, as purposeful as she was loyal.
