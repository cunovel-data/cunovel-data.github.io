{"id":77195,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"I was given my mother\u0027s name, Frances, and my grandmother\u0027s name, Catherine, because—\" Graham cut her off with an impatient wave of his hand. He continued to smile so she wouldn\u0027t think he was overly irritated with her. \"No, no, lass, I\u0027m not wanting to hear how you came by two names now. I\u0027m wanting to hear your reasons for wanting this English woman here.\" She could feel herself blushing over the misunderstanding. \"Lady Judith Elizabeth is my friend. I would like her to be by my side when my time comes to deliver this baby. She has already given me her word that she\u0027ll come to me.\" \"Friend and English? How can this be?\" Gelfrid asked. He rubbed his jaw while he worried over that contradiction. Frances Catherine knew the elder wasn\u0027t deliberately baiting her. He looked genuinely puzzled. She didn\u0027t believe anything she could say would make the elder understand. In truth, she didn\u0027t believe Patrick truly understood the bond she had formed with Judith so many years ago, and her husband wasn\u0027t nearly as set in his ways as Graham and the other elders were. Still, she knew she was going to have to try to explain. \"We met at the annual festival on the border,\" she began. \"Judith was only four years and I just five. We didn\u0027t understand we were… different from each other.\" Graham let out a sigh. \"But once you did understand?\" Frances Catherine smiled. \"It didn\u0027t matter.\" Graham shook his head. \" \u0027Tis the truth, I still don\u0027t understand this friendship,\" he confessed. \"But our laird was correct when he reminded us that we do not break our pledges. Your friend will be welcomed here, Frances Catherine.\" She was so overcome with joy, she sagged against her husband\u0027s side. She dared a quick look at the other council members then. Vincent, Gelfrid, and Duncan were smiling, but Owen, the elder she\u0027d believed had slept through the questioning, was now shaking his head at her. Iain noticed that action. \"You don\u0027t agree with this decision, Owen?\" The elder kept his gaze on Frances Catherine while he answered. \"I\u0027m in agreement, but I think we should give the lass fair warning. She shouldn\u0027t be getting her hopes up for naught. I stand with you, Iain, for I too know from my own experiences that the English can\u0027t keep their pledges. They follow their king\u0027s habits, of course. That scoundrel changes his mind every other minute. This English woman with two names might have given Patrick\u0027s wife her promise, but she won\u0027t be keeping it.\" Iain nodded agreement. He\u0027d wondered how long it would take for the council to come to that same conclusion. The elders were all looking much more cheerful now. Frances Catherine continued to smile, however. She didn\u0027t seem to be at all worried that her friend might not keep her promise. Iain felt a tremendous responsibility to protect each and every member of his clan. Yet he knew he couldn\u0027t protect his sister-in-law from the harsh realities of life. She would have to suffer this disappointment alone, but once the lesson was learned, she would surely realize she could only count on her own family. \"Iain, who will you send on this errand?\" Graham asked. \"I should go,\" Patrick announced. Iain shook his head. \"Your place is with your wife now. Her time draws near. I\u0027ll go.\" \"But you\u0027re laird,\" Graham argued. \"It\u0027s beneath your station—\" Iain wouldn\u0027t let him continue. \"This is a family matter, Graham. Since Patrick can\u0027t leave his wife, I must see to this duty. My mind\u0027s set,\" he added with a frown, to discourage further argument. Patrick smiled. \"I\u0027ve never met my wife\u0027s friend, Iain, but I can well imagine that when she sees you, she\u0027ll have second thoughts about coming here.\" \"Oh, Judith Elizabeth will be pleased to have Iain\u0027s escort,\" Frances Catherine blurted out. She turned to smile at her laird. \"She won\u0027t be at all afraid of you. I\u0027m certain. I thank you, too, for offering to go on this journey. Judith will feel safe with you.\" Iain raised an eyebrow over that last remark. Then he let out a long sigh. \"Frances Catherine, I\u0027m just as certain she won\u0027t willingly come up here. Do you want me to force her?\" Because she was staring at Iain, she didn\u0027t see Patrick give his brother a quick nod. \"No, no, you mustn\u0027t force her. She\u0027ll want to come to me.\" Both Patrick and Iain gave up trying to caution her against getting her hopes up. Graham politely excused Frances Catherine from the meeting. Patrick took hold of her hand and started for the doors. She was in a hurry to get outside so she could hug her husband and tell him how pleased she was to be married to him. He\u0027d been so… magnificent when he\u0027d stood up for her. She\u0027d never doubted that he would, of course, but she still wanted to give him the praise she thought he\u0027d want to hear. Husbands needed their wife\u0027s compliments every now and again, didn\u0027t they? She had almost reached the top step to the entrance when she heard the name Maclean mentioned by Graham. She stopped to listen. Patrick tried to tug her along, and so she kicked off her shoe and motioned for him to fetch it for her. She didn\u0027t care if he thought she was clumsy. She was too curious to hear what the discussion was about. Graham had sounded so angry. The council wasn\u0027t paying her any attention. Duncan had the floor. \"I\u0027m against any kind of an alliance with the Dunbars. We don\u0027t need them,\" he added in a near shout. \"And if the Dunbars form an alliance with the Macleans?\" Iain asked, his voice shaking with fury. \"Get your head out of the past, Duncan. Consider the ramifications.\" Vincent spoke up next. \"Why must it be the Dunbars? They\u0027re as slick as wet salmon and as sneaky as the English. I can\u0027t abide the thought. Nay, I can\u0027t.\" Iain tried to hold on to his patience. \"The Dunbar land sits between the Macleans and us, I would remind you. If we don\u0027t align ourselves with them, they could very well turn to the bastard Macleans for protection. We can\u0027t allow that. It\u0027s simply a choice between bad or worse.\" Frances Catherine wasn\u0027t able to hear any more of the discussion. Patrick had put her shoe back on her foot and was once again nudging her along. She forgot all about praising her husband. The minute the doors closed behind them, she turned to Patrick. \"Why do the Maitlands hate the Macleans?\" \"The feud goes way back,\" he answered. \"Before my time.\" \"Could it ever be mended?\" Patrick shrugged. \"Why do the Macleans interest you?\" She couldn\u0027t tell him, of course. She\u0027d be breaking her promise to Judith if she did, and she would never betray that confidence. There was also the telling fact that Patrick would have heart palpitations if he ever found out Judith\u0027s father was Laird Maclean. Aye, there was that consideration as well. \"I know the Maitlands are feuding with the Dunbars, the Macphersons too, but I hadn\u0027t heard about the Macleans. That is why I was curious. Why don\u0027t we get along with any of the other clans?\" Patrick laughed. \"There are a few we call friends,\" he told her. She decided to change the topic around to the praise she wanted to give him. Patrick walked her back to their home, and after giving her a long kiss in farewell, he turned to go back to the courtyard. \"Patrick, you do realize my loyalty belongs to you, don\u0027t you?\" his wife asked. He turned back to her. \"Of course.\" \"I\u0027ve always considered your feelings, haven\u0027t I?\" \"Yes.\" \"Therefore, if I knew something that would upset you, it would be better for me to keep silent, wouldn\u0027t it?\" \"No.\" \"If I told, it would mean breaking a promise to someone else. I couldn\u0027t do that.\" Patrick walked back to stand directly in front of his wife. \"What are you trying not to tell me?\" She shook her head. \"I don\u0027t want Iain to force Judith,\" she blurted out, hoping to turn his attention away from the talk about old promises. \"If she can\u0027t come here, he mustn\u0027t use force.\" She nagged Patrick into giving his word. He reluctantly agreed, just to please her, but he had no intention of keeping his pledge. He wasn\u0027t about to let the Englishwoman break his wife\u0027s heart. Lying to Frances Catherine didn\u0027t sit well, though, and Patrick frowned over it all the way back up the hill. As soon as Iain came outside, his brother called out to him. \"We have to talk, Iain.\" \"Hell, Patrick, if you\u0027re going to tell me about another promise you\u0027ve given your wife, I\u0027ll warn you now, I\u0027m not in the mood to hear it.\" Patrick laughed. He waited until his brother reached his side, then said, \"I want to talk to you about my wife\u0027s friend. I don\u0027t care what it takes, Iain. Drag her here if you have to, all right? I won\u0027t have my wife disappointed. She has enough to worry about with the baby coming.\" Iain started walking toward the stables. His hands were clasped behind his back, his head bowed in thought. Patrick walked by his side. \"You are aware, aren\u0027t you, that if I force this woman, I could very well start a war with her family, and perhaps, if the king decides to take an interest, a war with England?\" Patrick glanced over to see what his brother thought about that remote possibility. Iain was smiling. Patrick shook his head. \"John won\u0027t involve himself in this unless he can gain something from it. Her family\u0027s going to be the problem. They certainly won\u0027t just let her leave on such a journey.\" \"It could get messy,\" Iain remarked. \"Will that matter?\" \"No.\" Patrick let out a sigh. \"When will you leave?\" \"Tomorrow, at first light. I\u0027ll talk to Frances Catherine tonight. I want to know as much as possible about this woman\u0027s family.\" \"There is something Frances Catherine isn\u0027t telling me,\" Patrick said, his voice halting, \"She asked me about the feud with the Macleans…\" He didn\u0027t go on. Iain was looking at him as though he thought he\u0027d lost his mind. \"And you didn\u0027t demand she explain whatever the hell it is she\u0027s keeping from you?\" \"It isn\u0027t that simple,\" Patrick explained. \"You have to be… delicate with a wife. In time she\u0027ll tell me what she\u0027s worrying about. I\u0027ll have to be patient. Besides, I\u0027m probably jumping to conclusions. My wife\u0027s worrying about everything these days.\" The look on Iain\u0027s face made Patrick sorry he\u0027d mentioned Frances Catherine\u0027s odd behavior. \"I would thank you for going on this journey, but you\u0027d only be insulted.\" \"This isn\u0027t a duty I embrace,\" Iain admitted. \"It will take seven or eight days to reach the holding, and that means at least eight back with a complaining woman on my hands. Hell, I\u0027d rather take on a legion of Macleans single-handedly than suffer this task.\" Iain\u0027s bleak tone of voice made Patrick want to laugh. He didn\u0027t dare, of course, for his brother would only bloody his face if he so much as cracked a smile. The two brothers walked along in silence for several more minutes, each caught up in his own thoughts. Patrick suddenly stopped. \"You can\u0027t force this woman. If she doesn\u0027t want to come here, then leave her be.\" \"Then why the hell am I bothering to go at all?\" \"My wife could be right,\" Patrick rushed out. \"Lady Judith Elizabeth might willingly come here.\" Iain gave his brother a hard glare. \"Willingly? You\u0027re out of your mind if you believe that. She\u0027s English.\" He paused to let out a weary sigh. \"She won\u0027t willingly come here.\" Chapter 2 She was waiting on her doorstep. Lady Judith had been given advance warning, of course. Two days before, her cousin Lucas had spotted the four Scottish warriors just a stone\u0027s throw away from the border crossing near Horton Ridge. Lucas hadn\u0027t been there by chance, he had been diligently following his aunt Millicent\u0027s instructions, and after nearly a month of twiddling his thumbs and daydreaming the early summer evenings away, he\u0027d spotted the Scots. He\u0027d been so surprised to see the full-blooded Highlanders, he almost forgot what he was supposed to do next. Memory quickly returned, however, and he rode at a dust-choking pace all the way to Lady Judith\u0027s remote holding to tell her she\u0027d best prepare herself for the visitors. There hadn\u0027t been much for Judith to do to ready herself. Since the day word had reached her through the intricate gossip vine that Frances Catherine was expecting, she\u0027d had most of her baggage packed and all of her friend\u0027s gifts wrapped in pretty pink lace ribbons. Frances Catherine\u0027s timing certainly could have been better. Judith had only just returned to her uncle Tekel\u0027s holding for her mandatory six-month visit when the message arrived. She couldn\u0027t pack up and go back to her aunt Millicent\u0027s and uncle Herbert\u0027s holding, for to do so would raise questions she wasn\u0027t about to answer, and so she hid her baggage and her gifts up in the loft of the stable and waited for her mother, who was home on one of her rare stopovers, to grow bored and leave again. Then she would broach the topic of her journey into Scotland with her guardian, Uncle Tekel. Her mother\u0027s older brother was a soft-spoken, mild-mannered man, the complete opposite in temperament from his sister, Lady Cornelia, unless he was drinking. Then he\u0027d turn as mean as a snake. Tekel bad been an invalid for as many years as Judith could remember back, and in the early years he rarely lost his temper with her, even in the evenings when the pain in his misshapen legs became too much for him to endure. She\u0027d know about his discomfort when he\u0027d start rubbing his legs and ask one of the servants to fetch him a goblet of hot wine. From past experience, the servants had learned to bring along a full jug. Some nights Judith was able to sneak away to her own chamber before her uncle became abusive, but other nights he would demand that she sit by his side. He\u0027d become quite melancholy and want to hold on to her hand while he talked about the past, when he\u0027d been young and fit, a warrior to be reckoned with. An overturned cart had crushed his knees into grains of sand when he was but twenty and two years in age, and once the wine dulled his pain and loosened his tongue, he would rail against the injustice of that freak accident. He\u0027d rail against Judith, too. She didn\u0027t let him know how much his anger upset her. A knot would form in her stomach and wouldn\u0027t go away until she was finally dismissed for the night. Tekel\u0027s drinking got much worse over the years. He began to demand his wine earlier and earlier in the day, and with each gobletful he consumed, his disposition would change more and more dramatically. By nightfall he would either be weeping with self-loathing or screaming incoherent insults at Judith.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-4.html","bookId":1844,"book":{"id":1844,"title":"The Secret (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #1)","description":"Storyline: Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud, as purposeful as she was loyal.
