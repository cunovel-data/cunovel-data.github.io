{"id":77214,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"He thought she looked like she was about to weep. Her eyes were misty, and it was very apparent to him that she was struggling to maintain her dignity. Judith hadn\u0027t been physically injured, but her feelings had certainly been trod upon. \"Winslow?\" Iain\u0027s voice was hard, furious. Isabelle\u0027s husband took a step forward. He knew what his laird was asking and immediately gave his explanation of what had happened in a quick, concise manner. Winslow still hadn\u0027t gotten over his anger, either. His voice shook. Iain put his hand on Judith\u0027s shoulder. He could feel her trembling. That notice made him even more furious. \"Judith is a guest in my brother\u0027s home.\" He waited until everyone inside the cottage had acknowledged that statement of fact, then added, \"But she is also under my protection. If there is trouble, you will bring it to me. Is that understood?\" The rafters shook from the fury in his voice. Judith had never seen Iain this angry. It was a little overwhelming. Frightening, too. She tried to remind herself that he wasn\u0027t upset with her, that he was actually defending her, but logic didn\u0027t help much. The look in his eyes still made her shiver. \"Laird Iain, do you realize what you\u0027re implying?\" The priest whispered his question. Iain stared at Judith when he gave his abrupt answer. \"I do.\" \"Hell,\" Brodick muttered. Iain let go of Judith and turned around to confront his friend. \"Do you want to challenge me?\" Brodick had to think the question over a long minute before shaking his head. \"No. You have my support. God knows you\u0027re going to need it.\" \"You have my support as well,\" Winslow called out. Iain nodded. The muscle in the side of his jaw quit flexing. Judith thought his friends\u0027 show of loyalty was calming his anger. Why the man needed their support was beyond her understanding. In England, hospitality was offered by all the members of the family to a guest, but here it was obviously very different. \"The council?\" Winslow asked. \"Soon,\" Iain answered. A gasp came from behind Judith. She turned to look at the midwives. She was surprised to see Helen\u0027s expression. The woman seemed to be relieved about the outcome of the inquisition. She was trying hard not to smile. That notice didn\u0027t make any sense to Judith. Agnes\u0027s expression didn\u0027t leave her guessing, however. Her eyes blazed with anger. Judith turned away from the woman. Father Laggan, she noticed, was watching her intently. \"Father, do you have any other questions to ask me?\" He shook his head. He smiled, too. Since no one was paying the two of them any attention now, she moved forward to ask the priest a question. Winslow, his brother Brodick, and Iain were in deep discussion, and the relatives at the table were all talking at once. \"Father, may I ask you something?\" she whispered. \"Of course.\" \"If there hadn\u0027t been any bruises, would you have condemned Isabelle and her son?\" Judith adjusted the shawl around her neck while she waited for his answer. \"No,\" he answered. She felt better. She didn\u0027t want to think a man of the cloth would be so rigid. \"Then you would have taken my word alone as proof enough, even though I\u0027m an outsider here?\" \"I would have found a way to support your claim, perhaps by calling on all of Isabelle\u0027s relatives to speak up on her behalf.\" He took hold of Judith\u0027s hand and patted her. \"The bruises made my task much easier.\" \"Yes, they did,\" she agreed. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me now, Father, I would like to leave.\" She hurried outside as soon as he\u0027d given her permission. It was probably rude of her to leave without saying good-bye to the others, especially their laird, but Judith couldn\u0027t stomach the idea of staying in the same room with Agnes a minute longer. The crowd had more than doubled in size since she\u0027d gone inside. Judith wasn\u0027t in the mood for their curiosity now. She held her head high as she made her way over to the tree where she had left her mount. She wasn\u0027t in the mood for the stallion\u0027s skittish behavior, either, she gave the animal a good swat on his left flank to get him to settle down long enough for her to gain the saddle. Judith was still too upset by the ordeal she\u0027d just gone through to go directly back to Frances Catherine. She needed to calm down first. She didn\u0027t have a destination in mind but goaded the stallion up the path toward the crest. She would ride until she\u0027d gotten rid of her anger, no matter how long it took. Father Laggan came outside Isabella\u0027s cottage a scant minute after Judith had left. He raised both hands into the air to gain the crowd\u0027s attention. His smile was wide. \"It has all been resolved to my satisfaction,\" he called out. \"Lady Judith cleared up the matter in quick time.\" A loud cheer went up. The priest moved to the side of the stoop to allow Brodick to pass by. Iain and Winslow followed. The gathering moved out of Brodick\u0027s way as he strode over to the trees where Judith had left his horse. He had almost reached his destination before he realized his mount was gone. Brodick had an incredulous look on his face when he whirled around. \"By God, she\u0027s done it again,\" he roared to no one in particular. He couldn\u0027t seem to make sense out of the insult Judith had given him by taking his horse. The fact that the stallion actually belonged to Iain didn\u0027t make any difference, either. \"Lady Judith didn\u0027t steal your horse,\" Winslow called out. \"She only borrowed it. Those were her words to me when she arrived here, and I imagine she still believes—\" Winslow couldn\u0027t go on. His laughter got in his way. Iain had more discipline. He didn\u0027t even smile. He gained his mount, then put his hand down to Brodick. The warrior was about to swing himself up behind his laird when Bryan, an older man with hunched shoulders and bright orange hair, took a step forward. \"The woman didn\u0027t steal your mount and you shouldn\u0027t be thinking she did, Brodick.\" Brodick turned around to glare at the man. Then another soldier shoved his way to the front of the crowd. He took his position next to Bryan. \"Aye, Lady Judith was probably just in a hurry,\" he said. Yet another and another came forward to offer their reasons for Lady Judith taking the mount. Iain couldn\u0027t have been more pleased. The issue wasn\u0027t really the borrowing of the horse, of course. The men were letting it be known to their laird that Judith had won their support… and their hearts. She\u0027d stood up for Isabelle and they were now standing up for her. \"She didn\u0027t have to help our Isabelle last night and she didn\u0027t have to come back here today to answer Father Laggan\u0027s questions,\" Bryan stated. \"You won\u0027t be speaking ill of Lady Judith, Brodick, or you\u0027ll answer to me.\" A stiff wind would have knocked Bryan over, so feeble was he in strength, yet he courageously challenged Brodick. \"Hell,\" Brodick muttered, his exasperation obvious. Iain did smile then. He nodded to Judith\u0027s champions, waited until Brodick had swung up behind him, and then goaded his mount forward. Iain assumed Judith would go directly back to his brother\u0027s home. The horse wasn\u0027t out front, however, and he couldn\u0027t imagine where she\u0027d gone. He stopped his mount so Brodick could drop to the ground. \"She might have ridden back up to the keep,\" Iain remarked. \"I\u0027ll look there first.\" Brodick nodded. \"I\u0027ll look down below,\" he said. He started to walk away, then suddenly turned around again. \"I\u0027m giving you fair warning, Iain. When I find her, I\u0027m going to give her hell.\" \"You have my permission.\" Brodick hid his grin. He waited for the catch. He knew Iain well enough to understand how his mind worked. \"And?\" he prodded when his laird didn\u0027t qualify his agreement. \"You may give her hell, but you can\u0027t raise your voice while you\u0027re at it.\" \"Why not?\" \"You might upset her,\" Iain explained with a shrug. \"I can\u0027t allow that.\" Brodick opened his mouth to say something more, then changed his mind. Iain had just taken all the bluster out of his indignation. If he couldn\u0027t yell at the woman, why bother lecturing her at all? He turned around and started down the hill, muttering under his breath. Iain\u0027s laughter followed him. Judith wasn\u0027t waiting for him at the keep. Iain backtracked, then took the path to the west that led up to the next ridge. He found her at the cemetery. She was walking at a fast clip along the path that separated the sacred ground from the trees. She had thought that a brisk walk would help her get rid of some of her anger over the ordeal she\u0027d just gone through for Isabelle, and had come upon the cemetery quite by chance. Curious, she\u0027d stopped to have a look. The burial ground was really a very pretty, peaceful place. Tall wooden slats, newly whitewashed and standing as straight as lances, surrounded the cemetery on three sides. Ornately carved headstones, some arched, others square-topped, filled the interior in neat rows. Fresh flowers covered almost every other plot. Whoever had been given the task of looking after this final resting place had done his duty well. The care and attention was very evident. Judith made the sign of the cross as she walked along the path. She left the cemetery proper and continued on up the narrow climb, past the line of trees blocking the sight of the valley below. The wind whistled through the branches, a sound she found quite melancholy. The ground reserved for the damned was directly ahead of her. She came to an abrupt stop when she reached the edge of the stark burial ground. There wasn\u0027t any whitewashed fencing here, or any ornately carved headstones. Only weathered wooden stakes had been used. Judith knew who was buried here. They were the poor souls the Church had decided belonged in Hell. Aye, there were robbers, and murderers, and rapists, and thieves, and traitors, of course… and all the women who had died during childbirth. The anger she\u0027d hoped to get rid of grew until it was a burning rage inside her. Wasn\u0027t there any fairness in the afterlife, either? \"Judith?\" She whirled around and found Iain standing no more than a few feet away. She hadn\u0027t heard him approach. \"Do you think they\u0027re all in Hell?\" He raised an eyebrow over the vehemence in her voice. \"Who are you talking about?\" \"The women buried here,\" she explained with a wave of her hand. She didn\u0027t give him time to answer her. \"I don\u0027t believe they\u0027re in Hell. They died doing their sacred duty, damn it. They suffered with the laboring and died fulfilling their obligation to their husbands and their priests. And for what, Iain? To burn in Hell for eternity because the Church didn\u0027t think they were clean enough for Heaven? It\u0027s all rubbish,\" she added in a harsh whisper. \"All of it. If that opinion makes me a heretic, I don\u0027t care. I cannot believe God would be so cruel.\" Iain didn\u0027t know what to say to her. Logic told him she was right. It was rubbish. In truth, he had never taken the time to think about such matters. \"A woman\u0027s duty is to give her husband heirs. Isn\u0027t that so?\" \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"Then why is it that from the moment she finds out she\u0027s carrying his child, she isn\u0027t allowed to go inside a church? She\u0027s considered unclean, isn\u0027t she?\" She asked him another question before he could respond to the first. \"Do you believe Frances Catherine\u0027s unclean? No, of course you don\u0027t,\" she answered. \"But the Church does. And if she gives Patrick a son, she need wait only thirty-three days before she undergoes the cleansing ritual and can return to church. If she gives him a daughter, she must wait twice as long… and if she dies during her laboring or any time before she\u0027s received the blessing, she\u0027ll end up here. How fitting for Frances Catherine to be buried next to a murderer and a—\" She finally stopped. She bowed her head and let out a weary sigh. \"I\u0027m sorry. I shouldn\u0027t have railed against you. If I could just force myself not to think about such matters, I wouldn\u0027t become so angry.\" \"It\u0027s in your nature to care.\" \"How would you know what\u0027s in my nature?\" \"The way you helped Isabelle is one example,\" he replied. \"And there are many other examples I could give you.\" His voice was filled with tenderness when he answered her. She felt as though she\u0027d just been caressed. She suddenly wanted to lean into him, to wrap her arms around him and hold him tight. Iain was so wonderfully strong, and she was feeling so horribly vulnerable now. She hadn\u0027t realized until that moment how much she admired him. He was always so certain about everything, so sure of himself. There was an air of quiet authority about him. He didn\u0027t demand respect from his followers. Nay, he\u0027d earned their loyalty and their trust. He rarely raised his voice to anyone. She smiled then, for she\u0027d just realized he had raised his voice to her several times. He wasn\u0027t as disciplined when she was around, she guessed. She wondered what that meant. \"If you don\u0027t like something, isn\u0027t it your duty to try to change it?\" he asked. She almost laughed over his suggestion until she realized from his expression he was quite serious. She was flabbergasted. \"You believe I could take on the Church?\" He shook his head. \"One whisper, Judith, added to a thousand others will become a roar of discontent even the Church can\u0027t ignore. Start with Father Laggan. Put your questions to him. He\u0027s a fair man. He\u0027ll listen to you.\" He smiled when he said the word \"fair.\" She found herself smiling back. He wasn\u0027t mocking her. Nay, he was really trying to help. \"I\u0027m not significant enough to make any changes. I\u0027m only a woman who—\" \"As long as you believe that nonsense, you won\u0027t accomplish anything. You\u0027ll defeat yourself.\" \"But Iain,\" she argued, \"what difference could I make? I would be condemned if I openly criticize the teachings of the Church. How would that help?\" \"You don\u0027t begin by attacking,\" he instructed. \"You discuss the contradictions in the rules. If you make one other person aware, and then another and another…\" He didn\u0027t go on. She nodded. \"I must consider this,\" she said. \"I can\u0027t imagine how I could make anyone pay any attention to my opinions, especially here.\" He smiled. \"You already have, Judith. You made me realize the contradictions. Why did you stop here today?\" he asked. \"It wasn\u0027t on purpose,\" she replied. \"I wanted to walk for a little while, until I\u0027d gotten rid of my anger. You probably didn\u0027t notice, but I was really very upset when I left Isabelle\u0027s cottage. I was ready to scream. It was all so unfair, what they put her through.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-23.html","bookId":1844,"book":{"id":1844,"title":"The Secret (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #1)","description":"Storyline: Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud, as purposeful as she was loyal.
