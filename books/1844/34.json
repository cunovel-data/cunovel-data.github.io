Judith thought he was deliberately dragging out his torture.\\n\\n \"You will walk with me,\" he commanded. \"Judith, wait here.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t give her time to argue with him, but started down the path. Andrew let go of her hand and went running after his laird.\\n\\n They were gone a long, long while. When they came back, Iain still had his hands clasped behind his back. Andrew walked by his side. Judith smiled when she saw how the child imitated his laird. His hands were also clasped behind his back and his swagger was every bit as arrogant as Iain\u0027s was. He was chattering away, and every now and then Iain would nod.\\n\\n Andrew acted as though a heavy weight had just been lifted from his shoulders. Iain dismissed him, waited until he was out of earshot and said, \"I asked you if you saw anyone, Judith. Would you care to explain why you didn\u0027t give me a proper answer?\"\\n\\n \"Actually you asked me if I saw a man or a woman standing nearby,\" she reminded him. \"I didn\u0027t lie to you. I saw a child, not a man or a woman.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t use that lopsided logic on me,\" he countered. \"You knew what I was asking. Now I would like to know why you didn\u0027t tell me.\"\\n\\n She let out a sigh. \"Because the matter was between the child and me,\" she explained. \"I didn\u0027t feel the need to bother you with it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m your husband,\" he reminded her. \"What the hell do you mean, you didn\u0027t feel the need to bother me?\"\\n\\n \"Iain, I was certain I could take care of it.\"\\n\\n \"That wasn\u0027t your choice to make.\"\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t angry. He was simply instructing Judith in the proper way to handle her problems.\\n\\n She was trying not to get worked up over this issue, and failing miserably. She folded her arms across her waist and frowned. \"Do I ever have any choices?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my duty to take care of you.\"\\n\\n \"And also to take care of my problems?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"That makes me no better than a child. God\u0027s truth, I don\u0027t believe I like being married very much. I had more freedom when I lived in England.\"\\n\\n He let out a sigh. She was saying the most outrageous things and acting as though she\u0027d only just realized her lot in life, as a woman. \"Judith, no one is completely free.\"\\n\\n \"You are.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"As laird, I have far more restrictions than any of the warriors serving under me. My every action is accountable to the council. Everyone has a place here, responsibilities as well. Wife, I don\u0027t like hearing you tell me you don\u0027t like being married to me.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say I didn\u0027t like being married to you, husband. I said I didn\u0027t like being married very much. It\u0027s most restrictive. There is a difference.\"\\n\\n The look on his face indicated he didn\u0027t agree. He pulled her into his arms and kissed her. \"You will like being married to me, Judith. I command it.\"\\n\\n It was a ridiculous order. She pulled back and looked up at him. She was certain he was jesting and his amusement would be there, in his expression.\\n\\n Iain wasn\u0027t jesting however. Lord, he looked… worried, vulnerable too. She was surprised by that notice, and very, very pleased. She went back into his arms. \"I love you,\" she whispered. \"Of course I like being married to you.\"\\n\\n He squeezed her tight. \"And you will, therefore, like giving me your problems to solve,\" he announced.\\n\\n \"Sometimes I will,\" she said, refusing to give him her full agreement. \"And sometimes I will solve them myself.\"\\n\\n \"Judith—\"\\n\\n She interrupted him. \"Frances Catherine told me that you were more of a father to Patrick than an older brother. You grew up solving all his problems for him, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps, when we were younger,\" he admitted. \"Now that we\u0027re both adults, we decide together what\u0027s to be done whenever a problem crops up. I rely on him as much as he relies on me. Tell me what my brother has to do with this discussion? You do want me to take care of you, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, of course I do,\" she answered. \"I just don\u0027t want to be a burden. I want to be able to share my problems with you, not hand them over. Do you understand? I want to belong, to be important enough to you that you would want to share your worries with me. Could you not learn to treat me with the same consideration you give Patrick?\"\\n\\n Iain didn\u0027t know what to say to her. \"I must consider this,\" he announced.\\n\\n She leaned against him so he wouldn\u0027t see her smile. \"That is all I would ask.\"\\n\\n \"I try to be open to new ideas, Judith.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, of course you do.\"\\n\\n She kissed him on his chin. He leaned down and captured her mouth for a long kiss. He was reluctant to stop touching her, but finally forced himself to pull away.\\n\\n Judith spotted Andrew standing a fair distance away from them.\\n\\n Iain didn\u0027t turn around when he called out, \"Are you ready, Andrew?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Laird,\" he called back.\\n\\n \"How did you know he was standing there?\"\\n\\n \"I heard him.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"You didn\u0027t need to hear,\" he explained.\\n\\n His remark didn\u0027t make any sense. He sounded terribly arrogant.\\n\\n \"Where are you taking him?\" she asked in a whisper, so the boy wouldn\u0027t hear.\\n\\n \"To the stables,\" Iain answered. \"He\u0027s going to help the stable master.\"\\n\\n \"Is this a punishment? Iain, don\u0027t you think—\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll discuss this tonight,\" he interrupted.\\n\\n She nodded. She was so pleased he hadn\u0027t ordered her to stay out of the matter altogether, she felt like smiling. \"As you wish,\" she told him.\\n\\n \"I wish for you to return to the keep.\"\\n\\n She nodded. She bowed to her husband and started up the hill.\\n\\n \"You will rest this afternoon,\" he called after her.\\n\\n \"Yes, Iain.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m meaning what I say, Judith.\"\\n\\n She realized then he expected an argument. Since she hadn\u0027t given him one, he assumed she wasn\u0027t going to obey. She tried not to laugh. Her husband was beginning to understand her.\\n\\n She did keep her promise. She had a nice visit with Frances Catherine first, and after Patrick had assisted his wife back down the hill to their cottage for her afternoon rest, Judith went upstairs to her room. Her mind was centered on the ever present worry about Frances Catherine\u0027s birthing, and she believed she had finally come up with a solution. Judith didn\u0027t believe she was knowledgeable enough to know what to do if the birthing became complicated, but Helen would surely have enough experience to know what to do, wouldn\u0027t she? Andrew\u0027s mother would have to soften in her attitude toward her now, Judith thought, and perhaps if she used the correct approach, she could gain the midwife\u0027s cooperation without having to involve Agnes.\\n\\n Frances Catherine was bound to have a fit. Judith would have to convince her Helen would be a help and not a hindrance.\\n\\n She fell asleep praying it would be true.\\n\\n Chapter 12\\n\\n She slept throughout the night. When she awoke, Iain had already left the chamber. Judith remembered that she needed to hurry to begin her day. She spotted her satchels neatly stacked in the corner and assumed Iain had carried them up from Frances Catherine\u0027s cottage.\\n\\n After putting her things away in the smaller chest and straightening the chamber, she went downstairs.\\n\\n Gelfrid was sitting with Duncan at the table, eating the morning meal. Both elders started to stand when she entered the room, but she waved them back into their chairs.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you going to join us, lass?\" Gelfrid asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll just take this apple with me, thank you. I have an important errand to complete.\"\\n\\n \"You look just fine wearing our plaid,\" Duncan muttered. He frowned while he gave his compliment, acting as though it was a painful chore to praise her.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t laugh. She did smile, though. Duncan, she decided, was very like Gelfrid. He was all bluster on the outside, but full of tender feelings inside.\\n\\n \"Her face still looks frightful,\" Gelfrid remarked. \"She could have had her eye torn clean out, Duncan,\" he added with a nod.\\n\\n \"Aye, she could have,\" Duncan agreed.\\n\\n Judith hid her exasperation. \"Gelfrid, was there anything you wished me to do before I leave?\"\\n\\n He shook his head.\\n\\n \"Have you seen Graham this morning?\" she asked. \"He might want something done, and I would like to get my duties organized in my mind before I start my day.\"\\n\\n \"Graham went hunting with Patrick and a few of the others,\" Gelfrid explained. \"He should be back in time for the nooning meal. They left right at dawn.\"\\n\\n \"Did Iain go with them?\"\\n\\n Duncan answered her question. \"He and his men went in the opposite direction to have a word or two with the Macphersons. They border us on the west.\"\\n\\n She caught the hesitation in his voice. \"I\u0027m not believing this \u0027have a word or two,\u0027 Duncan. Are we feuding with the Macphersons, too?\"\\n\\n The elder nodded. \"No need to get yourself worried. It\u0027s only a halfhearted feud. The Macpherson laird is so inept, it isn\u0027t worth the trouble fighting with them. There won\u0027t be any bloodshed.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re certain of this, Duncan?\"\\n\\n \"I am,\" he answered. \"There won\u0027t be a battle.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, it\u0027s more nuisance than amusement for Iain,\" Gelfrid explained.\\n\\n \"Your husband won\u0027t be home until nightfall,\" Duncan added.\\n\\n \"Thank you for telling me,\" Judith replied. She made a curtsy, then turned and hurried out of the hall.\\n\\n Judith was halfway down the hill before she realized she didn\u0027t know where Helen lived. She wasn\u0027t about to ask Frances Catherine for directions. Her friend would demand an immediate explanation as to why she would want to speak to the midwife. Judith was determined to talk to Helen first before broaching the topic with her friend.\\n\\n She turned toward Isabelle\u0027s cottage. Remembering Agnes\u0027s boast during the horrid inquisition that both she and Helen lived close enough to have heard screams during the birthing, Judith was certain Isabella would be able to point the way for her.\\n\\n Spotting Father Laggan coming up the slope, she waved to the priest and hurried to meet him.\\n\\n \"Did you put Merlin in the ground?\" she asked.\\n\\n He smiled. \"I did.\" he answered. \"Now I\u0027m back to give Isabelle\u0027s son a proper blessing.\"\\n\\n \"Are you always in such a rush, Father?\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Tis the truth I usually am,\" he answered. He took Judith\u0027s hand in both of his and said, \"You\u0027ve got a happy wedded look about you. Iain\u0027s treating you well, isn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Father,\" she replied. \"Will you share our supper with us tonight?\"\\n\\n \"I would be pleased to,\" he returned. \"And have you the time to stop in to say hello to Isabelle with me now?\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" she answered. \"But first I would like to have a talk with one of the midwives,\" she explained. \"Do you happen to know where Helen lives?\"\\n\\n The priest nodded. He was kind enough to escort Judith there. He knocked on the door for her. Helen was given quite a startle to find both the priest and the laird\u0027s wife waiting on her stoop. Her hand flew to her bosom.\\n\\n Judith saw how worried she looked and immediately tried to put her at ease.\\n\\n \"Good day, Helen,\" she began. \"Father Laggan was kind enough to show me the way to your home. He was on his way to bless Isabelle\u0027s son,\" she added. \"And I wanted to talk to you about a personal matter… if you have the time. I could come back later if you wish.\"\\n\\n Helen backed away from the entrance and graciously invited her guests inside.\\n\\n The aroma of freshly baked bread filled the air. Father Laggan beckoned Judith inside first and then followed her.\\n\\n The little cottage was spotless. The wooden floors had been scrubbed so clean; the slats seemed to have a shine to them.\\n\\n Judith sat at the table, but the priest went over to the hearth and leaned over the iron kettle hanging on the rod above the fire;\\n\\n \"What have we here?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Mutton stew,\" Helen replied, her voice a whisper. She held her apron in both hands in a grip that made her knuckles white.\\n\\n \"Is it about ready to taste, Helen?\" Father Laggan asked.\\n\\n His hint wasn\u0027t subtle. Feeding the priest put Helen at ease. She ushered him over to the table and then gave him a huge helping of the mutton. Judith was surprised by the priest\u0027s appetite. He was as thin as a rail, yet ate enough for two fully grown men.\\n\\n Helen lost most of her worried expression while she served the priest. It was obvious to Judith she was enjoying the compliments the priest was giving her. Judith added a few of her own after she\u0027d eaten two thick slices of black bread covered in rich jam.\\n\\n Helen wouldn\u0027t sit down, however. Father Laggan finished his meal, thanked the midwife for her hospitality, and then left to go to Isabelle\u0027s cottage. Judith stayed behind. She waited until the door closed behind the priest, and then asked Helen to sit with her at the table.\\n\\n \"I would thank you again—\" Helen began.\\n\\n Judith cut her off. \"I didn\u0027t come here to gain your apologies. That problem was taken care of and Andrew has learned his lesson.\"\\n\\n \"Since his father passed away, the boy has been… clinging. He thinks he must stay by my side all the time to protect me.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps he\u0027s worried inside that you might also die and he\u0027d be left alone,\" Judith suggested.\\n\\n Helen nodded. \"There\u0027s only the two of us now. It\u0027s difficult for him.\"\\n\\n \"Are their uncles or cousins who—\"\\n\\n She stopped her question when Helen shook her head. \"We are quite alone, Lady Judith.\"\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re not,\" Judith argued. \"You\u0027re part of this clan. Your son will grow up to be a Maitland warrior. If there aren\u0027t any uncles or cousins to direct Andrew, then the matter should have been mentioned to Iain. Helen, you know how important it is for a child to believe he\u0027s important.\" She paused to smile at the midwife before adding, \"It\u0027s important for women too, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Aye, it is,\" Helen agreed. \"It\u0027s been difficult, living here. I come from the MacDougall family. I\u0027ve eight sisters and two brothers,\" she added with a nod. \"Needless to say, there was always someone to talk to, and always time for a friendly visit. It\u0027s different here. The women work from dawn to dusk. Sundays are just the same. And yet, I find I envy them. They have husbands to look after.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-34.html","bookId":1844,"book":{"id":1844,"title":"The Secret (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #1)","description":"Storyline: Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud, as purposeful as she was loyal.
