His thumb slowly rubbed across her lower lip and she couldn\u0027t imagine why he\u0027d done that, even as shivers of pleasure coursed through her body. He shook his head at her again; a signal, she guessed, that she was to remain silent. She nodded to let him know she understood. She simply had to quit staring at him. Her stomach was fluttering, her heart as well, and she knew she\u0027d be blushing in no time at all if she didn\u0027t control her thoughts. She thought she\u0027d die if he had any inclination of his effect on her. Judith closed her eyes and rested against him. Both his arms were wrapped around her waist. It would be easy for her to pretend he wanted to hold her, easy to dream impossible dreams about the handsome laird too. She told herself she wouldn\u0027t allow such nonsense. She was made of stronger stuff and could certainly control her emotions, and her thoughts. The wait continued. When Iain was finally certain the Macphersons were well away from their shelter, he let go of his fierce hold on her. He gently nudged her face up, to look at him, with his thumb under her chin. He\u0027d meant to tell her the threat was over, but he forgot his intention the second her gaze met his. Desire such as he\u0027d never experienced before gained his full attention. His discipline deserted him. He felt powerless against this attraction. He couldn\u0027t stop himself from tasting her. He slowly leaned down, giving her plenty of time to pull away from him if she wanted to, but Judith didn\u0027t move. His mouth gently brushed over hers. Once. Twice. And still she didn\u0027t pull away. He wanted more. His hand clasped her jaw and his mouth settled possessively on top of hers. He captured her gasp, ignored it. He thought to end this attraction with one thorough kiss. He told himself his curiosity would then be appeased. He\u0027d know the taste of her, and the feel of her soft lips too, and then it would be finished. He would be sated. It didn\u0027t work out that way. Iain recognized that fact soon enough. He couldn\u0027t seem to get enough of her. Damn, she tasted good. And she was so soft, so warm and giving in his arms. He needed more. He forced her mouth open, and before she guessed his intent, his tongue swept inside to mate with hers. She did try to pull away from him then, though only for the briefest of seconds. Then she wrapped her arms around his waist and clung to him. His tongue rubbed against hers until he was shaking with his need. She certainly wasn\u0027t acting shy now. Nay, she was actively kissing him back. He growled low in his throat. She whimpered. Passion raged between them. His mouth slanted over hers again and again, and when he realized he wasn\u0027t going to be content until he was resting between her thighs, he forced himself to stop. Iain was stunned, furious too, though only with himself. His lack of discipline was appalling to him. She was staring up at him with such a confused expression on her face. Her lips looked swollen… he wanted to kiss her again. He shoved her head down on his shoulder, then jerked on the reins of his mount to get them moving back to the main path. Judith was thankful for his inattention now. She was still shaking from the kisses he\u0027d given her, astonished too by her own passionate response. It was the most wonderful and the most frightening experience she\u0027d ever had. She wanted more. She didn\u0027t think Iain did, though. He hadn\u0027t said a word to her, but the way he\u0027d abruptly pulled away from her and the anger she\u0027d glimpsed in his eyes were both sound indications he\u0027d been displeased. She suddenly felt very inadequate and horribly embarrassed. Then she felt like shouting at the brute for injuring her feelings and her pride. Her eyes filled with tears. She took a deep breath in an effort to regain her composure. After a few minutes her trembling subsided a little, and she was beginning to think she\u0027d won this battle with her own confusing emotions, when Iain injured her feelings again. He stopped his mount next to Alex\u0027s brown stallion, and before Judith had an inkling of what he was planning to do, the rude man had dumped her into Alex\u0027s lap. So be it. If he didn\u0027t want to have anything more to do with her, she would retaliate in kind. She refused to even glance his way. She carefully adjusted her skirts, keeping her gaze downcast all the while, and prayed to her Maker that Iain wouldn\u0027t see her blush. Her face felt like it was on fire. Iain took over the lead. Gowrie nudged his mount into position behind his laird, then she and Alex joined the procession. Brodick was once again left to protect the rear. \"Are you cold, lass?\" Alex whispered that question close to her ear. The concern in his voice was most apparent. \"No,\" she answered. \"Then why are you trembling?\" \"Because I\u0027m cold.\" She realized the contradiction in her answers and let out a little sigh. If Alex thought she wasn\u0027t making any sense, he was kind enough not to mention it. He didn\u0027t speak another word to her that long afternoon, and she didn\u0027t speak to him. She couldn\u0027t seem to get comfortable in his arms, either. Her back brushed against his chest several times, but she couldn\u0027t relax enough to lean back against him. By nightfall she was so exhausted she would barely keep her eyes open. They stopped at a beautiful stone cottage with a thatched roof, nestled in the side of the mountain. Thick ivy covered the south side of the structure and a stone path led all the way from the barn adjacent to the front door of the cottage. A gray-haired man with a thick beard and wide shoulders stood in the entrance. He smiled in greeting and hurried outside. Judith saw the woman hovering in the doorway. She had been standing behind her husband, but when he moved forward, she backed into the shadows. \"We\u0027ll be spending the night here,\" Alex said. He dismounted, then reached up to assist her. \"You\u0027ll have a roof over your head and a good night\u0027s rest.\" She nodded. Alex, she decided, was a truly compassionate man. He\u0027d helped her to the ground, but he didn\u0027t let go of her. He knew she\u0027d fall on her face if he did. He didn\u0027t mention her pitiful condition, and even allowed her to hold on to his arms until she could make her legs quit shaking. His hands held her by her waist and she knew he could feel her trembling. \"Get your hands off her, Alex.\" Iain\u0027s hard voice came from behind Judith. Alex immediately let go. Her knees buckled. Iain caught her from behind just as she was falling forward. His left arm was tightly wrapped around her waist and he wasn\u0027t at all gentle when he pulled her to his side. Alex backed away from his laird\u0027s glare, then turned to walk toward the cottage. Iain continued to stand there holding Judith for several more minutes. Her shoulders were pressed tightly against his chest. She kept her head bowed. She was so weary she wanted to close her eyes and let him carry her inside. That wouldn\u0027t have been proper, of course. How could a man smell so wonderful after such a long day\u0027s ride? Iain\u0027s scent was a combination of the clean outdoors… and male. Heat radiated from him. She was drawn to his warmth, and when she realized that fact, she knew she should pull away. He was as distant as the storm brewing in the south. Judith knew he was only holding her because she needed his assistance. He felt responsible for her and was simply doing his duty. \"Thank you for your help,\" she said. \"You may let go of me now. I\u0027ve recovered.\" She tried to push his arm away. He had other intentions. He half turned her in his arms, then nudged her chin up. He was smiling. She didn\u0027t know what to make of that. He\u0027d been acting like a disgruntled bear just minutes before, though she admitted to herself that Alex had been his target. \"I\u0027ll let go of you when I want to,\" he explained in a soft whisper. \"Not when you give me permission to, Judith.\" His arrogance was outrageous. \"And when do you suppose that will be?\" she asked. \"Or am I allowed to ask?\" He raised an eyebrow over the irritation in her voice. Then he shook his head at her. \"You\u0027re angry with me,\" he said. \"Tell me why.\" She tried to push his hand away from her chin but gave up when he squeezed her jaw. \"I\u0027m not letting go until you tell me why you\u0027re upset,\" he told her. \"You kissed me.\" \"You kissed me too.\" \"Yes, I did,\" she admitted. \"I\u0027m not sorry either. What think you of that?\" The challenge was there, in her voice and her eyes. A man could forget his every thought if he allowed himself to be captured by her beauty. That thought settled in his mind even as he answered her. \"I\u0027m not sorry either.\" She gave him a disgruntled look. \"Perhaps you weren\u0027t sorry at the time, but you\u0027re sorry now, aren\u0027t you?\" He shrugged. She felt like kicking him. \"You\u0027d better not touch me again, Iain.\" \"Don\u0027t give me orders, lass.\" His voice had taken on a hard edge. She ignored it. \"When it comes to kissing me, I can give all the orders I want to. I don\u0027t belong to you,\" she added in a much softer tone of voice. He was looking like he wanted to throttle her. She decided she\u0027d been a little too high-handed with him. Iain seemed to have a prickly nature. \"I didn\u0027t mean to sound surly,\" she began. \"And I know you must be used to getting your way, because you\u0027re a laird and all. Still, as an outsider, I really shouldn\u0027t have to obey any of your commands,\" she continued in a reasonable tone of voice. \"In this instance, as a guest—\" She stopped trying to explain when he shook his head at her. \"Judith, do you agree that while you\u0027re in my brother\u0027s home, you\u0027ll be under his protection?\" \"Yes.\" He nodded. He smiled too. He acted as though he\u0027d just won an important argument, and she wasn\u0027t even certain what the topic had been. He let go of her and walked away. She chased after him. When she reached his side, she grabbed hold of his hand. He immediately stopped. \"Yes?\" he asked. \"Why are you smiling?\" \"Because you just agreed with me.\" \"How?\" She wasn\u0027t deliberately trying to bait him. He could see the confusion in her gaze. \"Until you return to England, I\u0027m responsible for you. You will follow all my commands,\" he added with a nod. \"That\u0027s what you just agreed to do.\" She shook her head. The man was daft. How in heaven\u0027s name had her announcement that he couldn\u0027t kiss her ever again led to this twisted conclusion? \"I agreed to no such thing,\" she said. She hadn\u0027t let go of his hand. He doubted she realized she was still holding on to him. He could have pulled away. He didn\u0027t. \"You told me I\u0027d be under Patrick\u0027s protection,\" she reminded him. \"Therefore, he would be responsible for me, Iain, not you.\" \"Yes,\" he agreed. \"But I\u0027m laird and Patrick therefore answers to me. Now do you understand?\" She pulled her hand away. \"I understand you think that both you and Patrick can give me orders,\" she replied. \"That\u0027s what I understand.\" He smiled. He nodded, too. She burst into laughter. He couldn\u0027t imagine what had caused that response. He wasn\u0027t left guessing long. \"Does that mean that you and Patrick are both accountable for all my actions?\" He nodded. \"My transgressions become yours?\" He clasped his hands behind his back and frowned down at her. \"Do you plan to cause mischief?\" \"Oh, no, of course not,\" she answered in a rush. \"I\u0027m really very thankful to you for allowing me to come to your home, and I certainly don\u0027t wish to cause any problems.\" \"Your smile makes me wonder about your sincerity,\" he remarked. \"I\u0027m smiling for a different reason altogether,\" she explained. \"I\u0027ve just realized what an illogical man you are,\" she added with a nod, when he looked so incredulous. \"I\u0027m not in the least illogical,\" he snapped. She didn\u0027t realize she\u0027d insulted him. \"Yes, you are,\" she countered. \"Unless you can explain how my decision not to let you kiss me again led to this bizarre conversation.\" \"The issue of my kissing you isn\u0027t relevant enough for discussion,\" he replied. \"It holds no importance.\" He might as well have slapped her. The hurt from his casually spoken words stung just as much. She wasn\u0027t about to let him know he\u0027d injured her feelings, though. She nodded, then turned and walked away from him. He stood there watching her for a long minute. Then he let out a weary sigh. Judith didn\u0027t understand, but she was already causing problems. His men couldn\u0027t keep their gazes off her. Damn, neither could he. She was a beautiful woman, and any man would notice. Yes, that made sense. That was logical. Yet the raw possessiveness he felt toward her was another matter altogether. That wasn\u0027t at all logical. He told her that ultimately he was responsible for her… until she returned to England. Hell, he\u0027d almost choked on the words. The thought of taking her back didn\u0027t sit well at all. What in thunder was wrong with him? How was he ever going to let her go? Chapter 4 She couldn\u0027t wait to be rid of him. Judith knew she wasn\u0027t thinking like a reasonable person now. The long, endless journey had worn her out so thoroughly, her mind had turned to mush. She was admittedly overreacting to Iain\u0027s harsh words. She couldn\u0027t seem to sort anything out because her feelings kept getting in her way. She was still feeling the sting of his rejection, she supposed. \"Judith, come and meet Cameron,\" Alex called out. Everyone turned to look at her. She hurried over to stand in front of their host. She made a quick curtsy and forced a smile. It was a difficult undertaking, for Cameron was staring at her as though she\u0027d just turned into a demon… or worse. The expression on his face didn\u0027t leave any doubt as to what he was thinking. He was apparently appalled by her very existence. Oh Lord, she really didn\u0027t have the strength to endure this nonsense. She let out a little sigh, then said, \"Good eve to you, sir.\" \"She\u0027s English.\" Cameron roared that statement of fact with such force, the veins in his forehead stood out. Judith had spoken in perfect Gaelic, but she hadn\u0027t been able to conceal the English accent. Her clothes were another clue as to her heritage, of course. While she well understood the shameful distrust that existed between the Scots and the English, Cameron\u0027s hostility was so unreasonable and so filled with loathing, he frightened her. She instinctively took a step back in an attempt to protect herself from his wrath. She bumped into Iain. She tried to move to his side, but he waylaid that intent when he put his hands on her shoulders. He tightened his hold and pulled her back until she was pressed against him,","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-10.html","bookId":1844,"book":{"id":1844,"title":"The Secret (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #1)","description":"Storyline: Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud, as purposeful as she was loyal.
