{"id":77222,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\"With their wives.\" He tried to move around her. She blocked his path. He didn\u0027t want to leave, and she didn\u0027t want to be responsible for forcing him out. The problem, of course, was his pride. She had to find a way to save that and get her way at the same time. \"How long have you lived here?\" she blurted out, thinking to keep him busy answering her questions until she could come up with a sound plan. \"Almost ten years now. When I became laird, I moved in with my Annie. She died five years ago. I passed on the duties of laird to Iain six months ago, and I should have moved out then, but I lingered on. I\u0027ve outstayed my welcome, I\u0027m certain.\" \"And Gelfrid?\" she asked when he tried to walk around her again. \"How long has he lived here?\" Graham gave her a puzzled look. \"Three years now,\" he answered. \"He moved in after his wife passed on. Judith, this chest is getting heavy. Let me pass.\" He once again tried to walk over to the doors. Judith rushed ahead of him. She pressed her back against the doors and splayed her arms wide. \"I\u0027m not letting you leave, Graham.\" He was astonished by her boldness. \"Why not?\" he demanded. He sounded irritated, but she didn\u0027t think he really was. \"Why?\" she asked. \"Yes, why?\" he demanded again. God help her, she couldn\u0027t come up with a single logical reason. Judith almost smiled then. She guessed that only left illogical reasons. \"Because you\u0027ll hurt my feelings.\" Judith could feel herself blushing. She felt like a fool. \"Aye, you will,\" she added with a nod. \"What in God\u0027s name are you doing, Judith?\" Brodick shouted from the landing above. Judith didn\u0027t dare move from the doors when she looked up. Gelfrid, she noticed, was standing next to Brodick. \"I\u0027m not letting Graham and Gelfrid leave,\" she called out. \"Why not?\" Brodick asked. \"I\u0027m keeping them,\" she shouted back. \"Iain kept me and I\u0027m keeping them.\" It was an outrageous and thoroughly empty boast, and completely ruined when Iain opened the doors. Judith went flying backward. Her husband caught her in his arms. Graham dropped the chest and reached out to catch her, too, and she suddenly found herself in a tug of war between the two men. She was blushing over her own clumsiness. \"Judith? What are you doing?\" Iain asked. She was making a complete idiot of herself. She wasn\u0027t going to tell Iain that. Besides, she was pretty certain he already knew. \"I\u0027m trying to make Graham listen to reason,\" she explained. \"Both he and Gelfrid want to move out.\" \"She won\u0027t let them,\" Brodick called out. Iain squeezed Judith\u0027s hand. \"If they wish to leave, you shouldn\u0027t interfere,\" he told her. \"Do you want them to move out?\" she asked. She turned and looked up at him, waiting for his answer. He shook his head. She smiled. Then she turned around to confront Graham again. \"You\u0027re being rude, Graham.\" He smiled. Iain was appalled. \"You must not speak to an elder in that tone,\" he ordered. \"And I mustn\u0027t hurt her feelings,\" Graham interjected with a nod. \"If it\u0027s that important to you, lass, I suppose Gelfrid and I could stay on.\" \"Thank you.\" Gelfrid had rushed down the steps. Judith could tell he was relieved. He was trying to glare at her and failing miserably. \"We\u0027re bound to argue,\" he announced. Judith nodded. \"Yes,\" she answered. \"You won\u0027t be pounding on my back every time I get a tickle in my throat.\" \"No.\" He grunted. \"So be it. Brodick, put my things back. I\u0027m staying on.\" Gelfrid rushed back up the steps. \"Watch what you\u0027re doing, boy. I won\u0027t have my chest bruised like that.\" Iain tried to pick up Graham\u0027s chest for him. The elder pushed his hands away. \"I\u0027m not so old I can\u0027t manage,\" he declared. In a softer tone of voice, he said, \"Son, your bride\u0027s a bit high-strung. She threw herself against that door and pitched such a fit, Gelfrid and I had to give in.\" Iain finally understood exactly what had happened. \"I appreciate your concession in giving in,\" he replied in a serious tone. \"Judith\u0027s adjustment will take time, and I could certainly use some help with her.\" Graham nodded. \"She\u0027s bossy.\" \"Aye, she is.\" \"Gelfrid and I can work on that flaw.\" \"And I as well,\" Iain said. Graham started back up the steps. \"Don\u0027t know what you\u0027re going to do about her tender feelings, though. I don\u0027t suppose any of us can change that flaw.\" Judith stood next to Iain and watched until Graham had disappeared around the corner. She knew her husband was staring at her. She guessed she really should offer him some sort of explanation for her behavior. She took hold of his hand and turned to look up at him. \"This is their home as much as it is yours,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t believe they really wanted to leave and so Iâ€¦\" \"You what?\" he asked when she didn\u0027t continue. She let out a sigh and turned her gaze to the floor. \"I made a complete fool of myself in order to get them to stay. It was all I could think of to save their pride.\" She let go of his hand and tried to walk away. \"They\u0027ll probably be talking about it for weeks.\" He caught her when she reached the middle of the great hall. He put his hands on her shoulders and turned her to face him. \"You\u0027re far more perceptive than I am,\" he told her. \"I am?\" He nodded. \"It never would have occurred to me that Graham and Gelfrid would want to stay.\" \"There\u0027s plenty of room.\" \"Why are you blushing?\" \"Am I?\" \"Are you feeling better today?\" She stared into his eyes while she thought about that question. \"I wasn\u0027t feeling ill last night\" \"I hurt you.\" \"Yes.\" She could feel her face burning with embarrassment. She turned her gaze to his chin. \"I\u0027m feeling much better today. Thank you so much for asking.\" It took all his discipline not to laugh at her. Whenever Judith was embarrassed, she resorted to extreme politeness. He\u0027d noticed that trait on the journey home, and he found it very endearing. After the night of passion they\u0027d shared together, it was damn amusing too. \"You\u0027re very welcome,\" he drawled out. He nudged her chin up and then leaned down. His mouth brushed over hers once, then once again. It wasn\u0027t enough for him. He deepened the kiss and hauled her up against him. She forgot about being embarrassed and concentrated on kissing him back. He finally pulled back. She sagged against him. \"Judith, I left a plaid on the bed. You\u0027re supposed to wear it.\" \"Yes, Iain.\" He kissed her again because she\u0027d given her agreement so quickly. Brodick interrupted them by shouting Iain\u0027s name. He enjoyed their reaction, too. Judith jumped. Iain glared. \"Erin\u0027s waiting to give you his report,\" Brodick announced from directly behind them. \"If you\u0027re about finished mauling your wife, I\u0027ll tell him to come inside.\" \"I\u0027m leaving, too,\" Judith said. Iain shook his head. \"You don\u0027t tell me what you plan to do, Judith. You ask my permission.\" He sounded like he was instructing a child. She was thoroughly disgruntled, but hid her reaction because Brodick was watching. \"I see,\" she whispered. \"Where did you think you were going?\" \"To collect the rest of my things from Frances Catherine\u0027s home.\" She decided not to give him time to give her permission. She stretched up, kissed him, and then hurried to the door. \"I won\u0027t be gone long.\" \"Aye, you won\u0027t,\" Iain called out. \"You will be back in ten minutes, Judith. I have need to speak to you about a few important matters.\" \"Yes, Iain.\" Iain watched her leave. As soon as the door shut behind her, Brodick started laughing. \"What the hell\u0027s so amusing?\" \"I was appreciating the fire in your wife\u0027s eyes when you told her she needed your permission, Iain.\" Iain grinned. He\u0027d appreciated her reaction, too. The woman certainly had an untamed wild spirit inside her. Erin came into the hall then, turning Iain\u0027s thoughts to far more important matters. He sent Brodick up the stairs to fetch Graham to hear what Erin had to say. Judith started down the hill in a hurry, then slowed her pace. It was a glorious day. The sun was shinning bright and the breeze was actually warm. She tried to concentrate on the beauty around her instead of the highhanded way Iain had told her she would have to get his permission whenever she wanted to do something. Did he actually believe she should get his approval before going to visit her dear friend? She guessed he did. Judith knew it was her duty to get along with her husband. She was supposed to obey him just as she had promised to during the wedding ceremony. There was also the telling fact that her husband happened to be the laird. Marriage, she decided, was going to take some adjustment in her thinking. She\u0027d stopped halfway down the hill and leaned against a fat tree while she considered her new position. She loved Iain; she trusted him completely. It would be wrong for her to openly defy him. She would have to be patient, she supposed, until he had reached the point where he didn\u0027t find it necessary to look out for her every minute. Perhaps Frances Catherine could offer a suggestion or two. Judith wanted to make Iain happy, but she didn\u0027t want him to turn her into a serf. Her friend had been married a long time and had certainly encountered a similar problem with Patrick. She wondered how she had gotten Patrick to listen to her opinions. Judith pulled away from the tree and continued on down the walkway. The first stone caught her in the center of her back. She was pitched forward and landed hard on her knees. She was so surprised, she instinctively turned around to see where the stone had come from. She saw the boy\u0027s face just seconds before the second stone hit her. The jagged rock tore into the tender flesh directly below her right eye. Blood poured down over her cheek. There wasn\u0027t time to scream. The third stone found its mark on the left side of her head. Judith collapsed on the ground. If there were other stones thrown, she didn\u0027t feel them. The force of the blow to her temple knocked her into a dead faint. Iain grew impatient when Judith didn\u0027t immediately return to the keep. He listened to Erin\u0027s report concerning the possibility of an alliance between the Dunbars and the Macleans, but his mind wasn\u0027t on the topic. Erin was telling him what he already knew, and the report was only being repeated for Graham\u0027s sake. The leader of the council hadn\u0027t believed such a union was possible, as both the Dunbar laird and the Maclean laird were too old and too set in their ways to give up any power for the sake of the other\u0027s clan. Now, listening to Erin\u0027s account of the meeting he\u0027d actually observed, Graham was fully convinced. And still Judith didn\u0027t return. His gut instinct nagged that something was wrong. He told himself she had simply lost count of the time. She was probably sitting at Frances Catherine\u0027s table, deep in discussion about some topic or other, and didn\u0027t realize the time. Reason didn\u0027t allay his worry, however. He couldn\u0027t sit still any longer. He didn\u0027t announce his intention to leave the meeting. He simply got up and started for the entrance. \"Where are you going, Iain?\" Graham called out. \"We\u0027ve need to form a plan now.\" \"I won\u0027t be gone long,\" Iain answered. \"I\u0027m going after Judith. She should have been back by now.\" \"She probably just lost track of time,\" Brodick suggested. \"No.\" \"Is she testing you, then?\" the warrior asked, smiling over that possibility. \"The woman\u0027s stubborn, Iain. She might have taken exception to your order.\" Iain shook his head. His denial was vehement. \"She wouldn\u0027t defy me.\" Brodick abruptly stood up. He bowed to Graham and then hurried after his laird. Iain took the path down to his brother\u0027s cottage. Brodick rode his mount and took the long way around the trees. Iain found her first. She was crumpled on the ground, resting on her side, and the only part of her face visible to him was covered with blood. He didn\u0027t know if she was dead or alive. And in those seconds it took for him to get to her, he was consumed with terror. He was incapable of reasoning anything through. Only one thought raced through his mind. He couldn\u0027t lose her. Not now, not when she had only just come into his bleak life. His roar of anguish echoed down the hills. Men came running, their swords drawn, ready. Patrick had just started out the doorway with his wife on his arm when the chilling sound reached him. He pushed Frances Catherine back inside, ordered her to bolt the door, and then turned and went racing up the hill. Iain wasn\u0027t aware he\u0027d shouted. He knelt down beside Judith and gently turned her until she was resting on her back. She let out a soft whimper. It was the sweetest sound he had ever heard. She hadn\u0027t been taken from him. Iain started breathing again. His men gathered in a half circle around him. They watched as their laird slowly checked Judith for broken bones. Brodick broke the silence. \"What the hell happened to her?\" \"Why doesn\u0027t she open her eyes?\" Gowrie asked at the same time. Patrick shoved his way through the crowd and knelt beside his brother. \"Is she going to be all right?\" Iain nodded. He didn\u0027t trust himself to speak yet. His attention was drawn to the swelling on the side of Judith\u0027s temple. He gently brushed her hair away to get a better look. \"Good Lord,\" Patrick whispered when he saw the damage. \"She could have killed herself in the fall.\" \"She didn\u0027t fall.\" Iain made that statement in a voice shaking with fury. Patrick was stunned. If she hadn\u0027t taken a fall, what happened to her? Brodick answered his question before Patrick had time to ask it. \"Someone did this to her,\" he said. He knelt down on one knee on the other side of Judith and began to gently wipe the blood away from her cheek with the edge of his plaid. \"Look at the stones, Patrick. There\u0027s blood on one of them. This wasn\u0027t an accident.\" It took every ounce of discipline Iain possessed not to let his rage take control. Judith came first. Retaliation could wait. He finished checking to make certain the bones in her legs and ankles were still intact, then turned to lift her into his arms. Patrick helped him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-31.html","bookId":1844,"book":{"id":1844,"title":"The Secret (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #1)","description":"Storyline: Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud, as purposeful as she was loyal.
