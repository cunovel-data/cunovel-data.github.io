{"id":77221,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"Iain shifted to his side and slowly eased his finger up inside her tight sheath. His thumb rubbed the delicate nub hidden between the folds, and Judith\u0027s reaction damn near snapped his own control. He\u0027d never had a woman respond to him with such honesty or with such abandon. Her trust in him was so complete, she was free of all inhibitions. She willingly, lovingly, gave him her body, and he would die before letting himself find fulfillment first. She came before his own need… even if it killed him. Loving him was certainly going to kill her. That was Judith\u0027s last coherent thought. She\u0027d blurted it out loud, too, but she was too caught up in trying to hold on to the threads of her control to know what she was saying or doing. She seemed to come apart inside. She cried out his name, and his own discipline vanished then. He felt her tremors and spread her thighs wider. He knelt between her legs. \"Put your arms around me, sweetheart,\" he whispered in a husky demand. He stretched up, covered her mouth with his, and forced her to stay still by holding the sides of her hips. He hesitated at the threshold for only a second or two, then slowly eased up inside her until he felt the barrier of her virginity. He was hurting her, but Judith didn\u0027t think this was such a terrible pain. The way he was kissing her made everything else seem unimportant. The pressure building inside her ached,-and she became even more restless in a bid to find a way to ease the sweet torment. Iain gritted his teeth against the incredible pleasure he was already feeling and the certain pain he was going to force on her, and then drove forward with one powerful thrust. She cried out in surprise and pain. She thought he had torn her apart. It felt as if he had. The haze of passion vanished. She started crying, and demanded that he leave her alone. \"I don\u0027t like this,\" she whispered. \"Hush, sweetheart,\" he whispered, trying to soothe her. \"It\u0027s going to be all right. Don\u0027t move yet. The pain will ease. Oh, God, Judith, don\u0027t try to move.\" He sounded angry and loving, and she wasn\u0027t able to understand anything he was saying to her. The pain throbbed, but another feeling, so foreign to anything she had ever experienced before, began to blend with the pain, confusing her even more. His weight kept her anchored to the bed and to him. He took deep, calming breaths in an effort to hold on to his discipline. She was so damn hot and tight, and all he wanted to think about was slamming into her again and again until he found his own release. Iain leaned up on his elbows and kissed her again. He desperately wanted to give her enough time to adjust to him, and he felt like the lowest of animals when he saw the tears streaming down her face. \"God, Judith, I\u0027m sorry. I had to hurt you, but I…\" The worry in his gaze soothed her far more than his half-given apology did. She reached up and stroked the side of his face. Her hand shook. \"It\u0027s going to be all right,\" she whispered, giving him the very same promise he\u0027d given her minutes earlier. \"The pain\u0027s gone now.\" He knew she wasn\u0027t telling the truth. He kissed her brow, then the bridge of her nose, and finally captured her mouth for a long, passionate kiss. His hand moved between their joined bodies and he began to stroke the very heat of her. It didn\u0027t take him long to rekindle her desire. He started to move, slowly at first, until he heard her moan of pleasure, and still he was able to hold back that thread of control he always withheld when he had been with other women, but Judith snatched that away from him with one simple declaration. \"I love you, Iain.\" Passion took control of his mind and his body. He thrust deep inside her, again and again. She lifted her h*ps to take more of him. She wouldn\u0027t let him be gentle any longer, nay, her nails dug into his shoulders, demanding more and more of this incredible bliss. Iain buried his face in the crook of her neck, gritting against the white-hot pleasure consuming him. The pressure building inside her was becoming unbearable. Just when she was certain she was going to die from the intensity of the feelings flooding her senses, he became even more forceful, more demanding. Judith kept trying to understand what was happening to her. Iain wasn\u0027t letting her. She was suddenly terrified. She felt as though her mind was being separated from her body and her soul. \"Iain, I don\u0027t—\" \"Hush, love,\" he whispered. \"Just hold me. I\u0027ll take care of you.\" Her mind accepted what her heart had always known. Judith surrendered. It was the most magical experience of her life. Bliss such as she\u0027d never known filled her. She arched her back and clung to her husband and let the ecstasy consume her. As soon as he felt her release, Iain found his own. With a low groan he poured his seed into her. His entire body shuddered with his own surrender. He collapsed against her with a grunt of male satisfaction. The scent of their lovemaking filled the air between them, a lingering reminder of the wonder they had just shared. Iain\u0027s heart hammered like a drumbeat, and he was so amazed by his absolute surrender to her, he couldn\u0027t move. He wanted to stay inside her forever. She was stroking his shoulders and sighing every now and then, and he wanted that to go on forever. Dear God, he was content. It took Judith much longer to recover for their lovemaking. She couldn\u0027t seem to quit touching him. She had at least a hundred questions to ask him. The first, and surely the most important, was to find out if she had pleased him. She poked him in his shoulder to get his attention. He thought she was letting him know he was too heavy for her. He immediately rolled to his side. She rolled with him. His eyes were closed. \"Iain, did I please you?\" He grinned. It wasn\u0027t enough. She needed to hear the words. He opened his eyes, found her staring down at him. She looked worried. \"How can you doubt you pleased me?\" he asked. He didn\u0027t give her time to come up with a reason. He wrapped his arms around her, lifted her to rest on top of him, and kissed her soundly. \"If you had pleased me any more, you would have killed me. Satisfied now?\" She closed her eyes and tucked her head under his chin. Aye, she was very satisfied. Chapter 11 Judith didn\u0027t get much sleep that night. Iain kept waking her up. It certainly wasn\u0027t deliberate on his part, but each time he turned, she was jarred out of a sound sleep. She kept moving farther away from him. He would immediately swallow up the space until he had taken over all of the bed and she was literally hanging on to the side. She finally drifted off to sleep a little before dawn. A few minutes later Iain touched her arm. She bolted upright and let out a startled scream. She scared the hell out of him, too. He had his sword in his hand and was getting out of the bed to defend her before he realized there weren\u0027t any intruders. Judith was terrified of something. She was still more asleep than awake, and it finally registered in his mind that she was afraid of him. There was a wild look in her eyes, and when he put the sword down and reached for her, she jerked back. He wouldn\u0027t be denied. He grabbed her by the waist, stretched out on his back and pulled her down on top of him. He trapped her legs by locking them between his own, and then began to soothe her by rubbing her back. She immediately relaxed against him. He let out a loud yawn and then asked, \"Were you having a bad dream?\" His voice was rough from sleep. She was terribly sorry she\u0027d disturbed him. \"No,\" she answered in a bare whisper. \"Go back to sleep. You need your rest.\" \"Tell me what happened. Why did you scream?\" \"I forgot,\" she explained. She rubbed the side of her face against his warm chest and closed her eyes. \"You forgot why you screamed?\" \"No,\" she replied. \"I forgot I was married. When you accidentally touched me, I just… reacted. I\u0027m not at all used to sleeping with a man.\" He smiled in darkness. \"I didn\u0027t think you would be,\" he told her. \"You aren\u0027t afraid now, are you?\" \"No, of course not,\" she whispered. \"Thank you for being so concerned.\" Lord, she\u0027d sounded polite. He was her husband and she was treating him like a stranger. Judith felt awkward… and vulnerable. She decided that she was just overly weary. She hadn\u0027t had much sleep at all since she\u0027d arrived in the Highlands, and all the commotion hadn\u0027t helped. She didn\u0027t have any intention of crying. The tears caught her by surprise. She knew she was behaving like a child, that she was being terribly foolish and emotional, but she didn\u0027t know how to stop herself. \"Judith?\" His thumb brushed away one of the tears on her cheek. \"Tell me why you\u0027re crying.\" \"There weren\u0027t any flowers. Iain, there should have been flowers.\" Her voice had been so soft, he wasn\u0027t certain he understood her. \"Flowers?\" he asked. \"Where weren\u0027t there any flowers?\" He waited for her to explain, but she stubbornly remained silent. He squeezed her. \"In the chapel.\" \"What chapel?\" \"The one you don\u0027t have,\" she answered. She knew she was sounding pitiful. She wasn\u0027t making any sense to him, either. \"I\u0027m exhausted,\" she added as an excuse for her confusing behavior. \"Please don\u0027t become upset with me.\" \"I\u0027m not upset,\" he replied. He continued to rub her backside while he thought about the odd remarks she\u0027d just made. What did she mean about flowers in a chapel he didn\u0027t have? She wasn\u0027t making any sense at all, but he decided he would have to wait until tomorrow to find out what was really bothering her. Her sweet, warm body soon turned his thoughts to other matters. He couldn\u0027t touch her again, not tonight. It would be too soon for her, and she needed time for the tenderness to ease: He couldn\u0027t stop himself from thinking about it, though. Within minutes he was hard and aching. It didn\u0027t matter. He would die before deliberately hurting her again. Iain hugged his gentle little bride and closed his eyes. Patrick had told him that he would walk through the fires of purgatory for his Frances Catherine, and Iain remembered he had laughed over that ridiculous notion. His brother had let all his defenses down. He\u0027d allowed himself to become vulnerable. Iain had thought his brother was a fool. It was quite all right to care about a wife, but to let a woman rule a warrior\u0027s every action, to want to please her at every turn the way Patrick sought to please his wife, that simply wasn\u0027t acceptable in Iain\u0027s mind. No woman was going to run him around in circles. He knew he could never allow himself to become that emotionally involved. Oh, he cared for Judith, more than he\u0027d ever intended, and now that she was his wife, he would allow himself to feel content. He\u0027d be damned if he\u0027d become vulnerable, though. He was extremely pleased that she loved him, of course. It would make her adjustment much easier. Iain didn\u0027t go back to sleep for a long while. He continued to think about all the logical reasons he would never allow himself to be turned into a lovesick weakling like Patrick, and when he finally fell asleep, he had convinced himself that he would distance his heart from his mind. He dreamed about her. Judith slept most of the morning away. Iain had already left the chamber when she finally stretched herself awake. She felt stiff, tender too, and she let out a loud, unladylike groan before getting out of the bed. She didn\u0027t have any idea what she was supposed to do now that she was the laird\u0027s wife. She decided she would have to get dressed and then hunt her husband down and ask him. She had packed her pale pink gown and fresh undergarments in her small satchel. She took her time getting ready, and when she was finally finished, she made the bed and folded the extra plaid Iain had left on top of the quilt. The great hall was empty. In the center of the table was a treacher filled with apples. A loaf of thick black bread was propped on one side of the treacher. Judith poured herself a goblet full of water and ate one of the apples. She kept expecting a servant to appear at any moment, but after waiting a long while, she decided they must all be outside, seeing to other duties. Graham caught her attention when he started down the steps. She was about to call out to him, then stopped herself. The leader of the council didn\u0027t know he was being observed. His expression was unguarded. He looked terribly sad, weary too. He glanced behind him once, shook his head, and then turned back to the steps again. Judith\u0027s heart went out to the elder. She didn\u0027t know the reason for his unhappiness, and she wasn\u0027t even certain if she should intrude or not. He was carrying a small chest in his arms. He stopped again when he was halfway down the stairs to adjust his hold on his possession, and then caught sight of her. She immediately smiled. \"Good day to you, Graham,\" she called out. He nodded. She thought his smile was forced. She hurried over to the entrance. \"Would you like me to help you carry that?\" \"Nay, lass,\" he answered. \"I\u0027ve got a good hold on it. Brodick and Alex are getting the rest of my things. Gelfrid\u0027s too. We\u0027ll be out of your way in no time at all.\" \"I don\u0027t understand,\" she said. \"You aren\u0027t in my way. Whatever do you mean?\" \"We\u0027re moving out of the keep,\" Graham explained. \"Now that Iain\u0027s taken a bride, Gelfrid and I will move into one of the cottages down the path.\" \"Why?\" Graham stopped when he reached the bottom step. \"Because Iain\u0027s married now,\" he patiently explained. Judith walked over to stand directly in front of him. \"Are you moving out because Iain married me?\" \"I\u0027ve just said so, haven\u0027t I? You\u0027ll be wanting your privacy, Judith.\" \"Graham, before Iain married me, I specifically remember you saying he had your support, that you agreed to this marriage.\" Graham nodded. \"That\u0027s true.\" \"Then you can\u0027t leave.\" He raised an eyebrow over that statement. \"What does the one have to do with the other?\" \"If you leave, it will show me that you don\u0027t really accept this marriage. But if you stay—\" \"Now, Judith, that isn\u0027t what this is about. You\u0027re newly married and you deserve your privacy. Two old men would only be getting in the way.\" \"Then you aren\u0027t leaving because you don\u0027t want to live under the same roof with an Englishwoman?\" The worry in her gaze was evident. Graham vehemently shook his head. \"If that was my feeling, I\u0027d say so.\" She believed him. She let out a little sigh of relief, and then asked, \"Where do Vincent and Owen and Duncan live?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-30.html","bookId":1844,"book":{"id":1844,"title":"The Secret (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #1)","description":"Storyline: Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud, as purposeful as she was loyal.
