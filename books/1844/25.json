I\u0027m not liking those odds.\"\n Iain nodded. \"I will call the council together tomorrow,\" he announced. \"For two separate purposes. First I\u0027ll talk to them about an alliance with the Dunbars.\"\n He didn\u0027t continue. \"What is the second purpose?\" Brodick asked.\n Iain found his first smile. \"Judith.\"\n Patrick and Brodick were the only ones who immediately understood what Iain was telling them.\n \"Father Laggan\u0027s thinking to leave early tomorrow morning,\" Brodick said.\n \"Detain him.\"\n \"For what purpose?\" Alex asked.\n \"The wedding,\" Iain answered.\n Patrick laughed. Brodick joined in. Alex continued to look confused. \"What about Judith?\" he asked. \"Will she agree?\"\n Iain didn\u0027t answer him.\n Chapter 9\n Patrick didn\u0027t tell Frances Catherine or Judith that Iain had returned home. He left early in the morning to go up to the keep. Judith helped her friend give the cottage a thorough cleaning.\n It was a little past the nooning hour when Iain knocked on the door. Judith opened it. Her face was covered with smudges and her hair was in wild disarray. She looked as though she\u0027d just finished cleaning the inside of the hearth.\n He was so damned happy to see her, he frowned. She smiled back. She was flustered over her appearance. She tried to straighten her hair by brushing the curls away from her face.\n \"You\u0027re back,\" she whispered.\n The man wasn\u0027t much for greetings. \"Yes. Judith, come up to the keep in one hour\u0027s time.\"\n He turned and walked away. She was crushed by his cold attitude. She chased after him. \"Why must I go up to the keep?\"\n \"Because I wish you to,\" he answered.\n \"But I might have plans set for this afternoon.\"\n \"Unset them.\"\n \"You\u0027re as stubborn as a goat,\" she muttered.\n The gasp from the doorway indicated Frances Catherine had heard her remark. Judith still wasn\u0027t sorry she had said such a rude thing, because she believed it to be true. Iain was stubborn.\n She turned away from him. \"I don\u0027t believe I missed you at all.\"\n He grabbed hold of her hand and pulled her back. \"Exactly how long was I gone?\"\n \"Three weeks, two days,\" she answered. \"Why?\"\n He grinned. \"But you didn\u0027t miss me, did you?\"\n She realized she\u0027d trapped herself. \"You\u0027re too clever for me, Iain,\" she drawled out.\n \"\u0027Tis the truth, I am,\" he agreed with a grin.\n Lord, she was going to miss this battling of wits with him, she realized. God\u0027s truth, she was going to miss him.\n \"If you want me to come up to your keep,\" she said, \"you should put the request to Patrick first so your chain of command will be properly followed. Do let me know what he has to say.\"\n She was deliberately trying to provoke him. He laughed instead.\n \"Iain?\" Frances Catherine called out. \"Is the council up at the keep?\"\n He nodded. Judith saw her friend\u0027s reaction to that news and pulled her hand away from Iain\u0027s.\n \"Now you\u0027ve done it,\" she announced in a low whisper.\n \"Done what?\"\n \"You\u0027ve upset Frances Catherine. Just look at her. She\u0027s worried, thanks to you.\"\n \"What did I do?\" he asked, thoroughly confused. Frances Catherine did look upset, and he couldn\u0027t imagine why.\n \"You\u0027ve just told her the council\u0027s up at the keep.\"\n Judith explained. \"Now she\u0027s worried I\u0027ve done something wrong and they\u0027ll send me back home before she has her baby.\"\n \"You gathered all that from one frown?\"\n \"Of course,\" she answered, exasperated. She folded her arms in front of her and frowned at him. \"Well?\" she demanded when he kept silent.\n \"Well, what?\"\n \"Fix it.\"\n \"Fix what?\"\n \"You needn\u0027t raise your voice to me,\" she ordered. \"You upset her. Now soothe her. Tell her you won\u0027t let the council send me back home yet. It\u0027s the least you can do. She\u0027s your dear sister-in-law and you really shouldn\u0027t want to see her upset.\"\n He let out a sigh fierce enough to part the branches on the trees. He turned and yelled to Frances Catherine. \"Judith isn\u0027t going anywhere.\" He looked at Judith again. \"Have I fixed it to your satisfaction?\"\n Frances Catherine was smiling. Judith nodded. \"Yes, thank you.\"\n He turned and walked toward his stallion. Judith hurried after him. She grabbed hold of his hand to get him to stop.\n \"Iain?\"\n \"What now?\"\n His gruff tone of voice didn\u0027t bother her. \"Did you miss me?\"\n \"Perhaps.\"\n That answer did prick her temper. She let go of his hand and tried to walk away. He caught her from behind. Wrapping his arms around her waist, he leaned down close to her ear and whispered, \"You really should try to do something about your temper, lass.\"\n He kissed her on the side of her neck, sending shivers down her legs.\n He never did answer her question. Judith didn\u0027t realize it until he\u0027d ridden away from her.\n The man could turn her mind into mush just by touching her. Judith wasn\u0027t given long to mull over that flaw, however, for Frances Catherine was insisting on gaining her attention.\n She all but shoved Judith through the doorway, then shut it behind her.\n \"Iain\u0027s in love with you.\"\n Frances Catherine sounded thrilled. Judith shook her head. \"I will not allow myself to think about love,\" she announced.\n Her friend laughed. \"You may not allow yourself to think about it, Judith, but you\u0027re in love with him, aren\u0027t you? I\u0027ve kept silent long enough. He never needs to know.\"\n The last remark caught Judith\u0027s full attention. \"Know what?\"\n \"About your father. No one ever needs to know. Let yourselfâ€”\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Just think about what I\u0027m suggesting,\" Frances Catherine said.\n Judith collapsed into the chair. \"I wish you would have your baby so I could go home. Each day I stay makes it more difficult. Dear God, what if I am falling in love with him? How do I stop myself?\"\n Frances Catherine walked over to stand behind her. She put her hand on her shoulder. \"Would it help if you thought about all his flaws?\" she asked.\n She was jesting with her friend. Judith took the suggestion to heart. She tried to come up with as many flaws as possible. She couldn\u0027t think of very many. The man was almost perfect. Frances Catherine suggested that was probably a flaw, too. Judith agreed.\n The two friends were so intent on their discussion, they didn\u0027t notice Patrick standing in the entrance. He\u0027d been very quiet when he opened the door out of consideration for his wife. She often took afternoon naps, and he didn\u0027t want to disturb her if she was sleeping now.\n Judith\u0027s remarks caught his attention. As soon as he realized she was giving his wife her opinion of Iain, he couldn\u0027t help but smile. Judith knew his brother almost as well as he did, and when she mentioned how stubborn he was, Patrick found himself nodding agreement.\n \"But you\u0027re still attracted to him, aren\u0027t you?\"\n Judith sighed. \"Yes. Frances Catherine, what am I going to do? I feel such panic inside when I think about what\u0027s happening to me. I can\u0027t love him.\"\n \"And he can\u0027t possibly love you, either,\" Frances Catherine asked. \"You\u0027re fooling yourself if you believe that. The man cares about you. Why can\u0027t you just accept it?\"\n Judith shook her head. \"What do you suppose he\u0027d do if he ever found out Laird Maclean was my father? Do you honestly believe he\u0027d still care about me?\"\n Years of training to control his reactions kept Patrick on his feet. God\u0027s truth, he felt as though he\u0027d just been given a hard blow to his midsection. He staggered back outside, then hastily pulled the door closed behind him. Patrick found Iain in the great hall. \"We have to talk,\" he announced. \"I\u0027ve just found out something you need to know.\"\n His brother\u0027s expression told Iain something was terribly wrong. \"Walk with me outside, Patrick,\" he ordered. \"I would rather hear your news in private.\"\n Neither brother said another word until they were well away from the keep. Then Patrick repeated what he\u0027d heard. Iain wasn\u0027t surprised. \"It\u0027s a hell of a mess,\" Patrick muttered.\n Iain agreed. It was one hell of a mess.\n It took Judith almost an hour to clean up. The topic of Iain kept coming up. Frances Catherine was determined to make Judith admit she was already in love with Iain, and Judith was just as determined not to admit any such thing.\n \"You should be helping me get over this attraction,\" Judith insisted. \"Do you realize how painful it\u0027s going to be for me to leave? I have to go back, Frances Catherine. It doesn\u0027t matter if I want to or not. This topic is most distressing for me. I don\u0027t wish to talk about it any longer.\"\n Frances Catherine was immediately contrite. She could tell her friend was close to tears. She patted Judith\u0027s shoulder. \"All right,\" she said, her voice a soothing whisper. \"We won\u0027t talk about it. Now then, help me change my gown. I\u0027m going up to the keep with you. Heaven only knows what the council\u0027s wanting. There has to be trouble brewing.\"\n Judith stood up. \"You\u0027re staying home. I\u0027ll go by myself. I promise to tell you everything that happens.\"\n Frances Catherine was having none of that. She was determined to stand beside Judith in the event of trouble.\n Judith was just as determined to make her friend stay put. Patrick came inside in the middle of their disagreement. He tried to get their attention with a word of greeting, and when that didn\u0027t work, he arrogantly raised his hand for silence.\n They ignored him. \"You always were as stubborn as a mule,\" Frances Catherine told her friend.\n Patrick was appalled. \"You mustn\u0027t talk to our guest like that,\" he ordered.\n \"Why not? She just called me worse.\"\n Judith smiled. \" \u0027Tis the truth, I did,\" she admitted sheepishly.\n \"Do stay out of this, Patrick,\" his wife suggested. \"I\u0027m just warming to this argument. I\u0027m going to win. It\u0027s my turn.\"\n Judith shook her head. \"No, you\u0027re not going to win,\" she countered. \"Patrick, please make her stay here. I have to go up to the keep. I won\u0027t be gone long.\"\n She hurried out of the cottage before her friend could continue the argument. It would be up to Patrick to keep her home.\n Judith knew she was probably late and Iain would surely be irritated, but she really wasn\u0027t worried about his temper. On the way up the steep hill she thought about that amazing fact. Iain was such a big, fierce-looking warrior, and his gigantic size alone should have turned her hair gray by now. She remembered feeling a little nervous the very first time she had seen him crossing the drawbridge to her uncle Tekel\u0027s home. The feeling had quickly vanished, however, and she had never, ever felt trapped or helpless when she was with him. Iain\u0027s manner was as gruff as a bear\u0027s, yet each time he touched her, he was very gentle.\n Uncle Tekel frightened her. The realization popped into her mind all at once. She didn\u0027t understand why she was afraid of him. Her uncle was an invalid who had to be carried about on a litter from place to place. As long as she stayed out of striking distance, he couldn\u0027t hurt her. Yet whenever she had been forced to sit beside him, she had always been afraid.\n His cruel words still had the power to hurt her, she admitted. She wished she was stronger and not so vulnerable. Then he couldn\u0027t hurt her. If she could learn how to protect her feelings, if she could learn to separate her mind from her heart, she wouldn\u0027t care what her uncle Tekel said to her. Nor would she care if she ever saw Iain againâ€¦ if she were stronger.\n Oh, what did it matter? She was going to have to go home, and Iain was certainly going to marry someone else. He would probably be very happy, too, as long as he could order his wife around for the rest of his life.\n She let out a groan of disgust. Thinking about Iain kissing any other woman made her stomach hurt.\n God help her, she was acting like a woman in love. She shook her head. She was far too intelligent to allow her heart to be crushed. She wasn\u0027t that ignorant, was she?\n She burst into tears. She was racked with heart-wrenching sobs in a matter of seconds. She couldn\u0027t make herself stop. She blamed Frances Catherine for her shameful condition because she had prodded and prodded until Judith had finally been forced to confront the truth.\n Judith moved off the path as a precaution against someone coming along and seeing her distress, and even hid behind a fat pine.\n \"Good Lord, Judith, what happened?\"\n Patrick\u0027s voice made her groan. She took a step back.\n He followed her. \"Did you injure yourself?\" he asked, his concern obvious.\n She shook her head. \"You weren\u0027t supposed to see me,\" she whispered. She wiped her face dry with the backs of her hands and took several deep breaths to calm herself.\n \"I didn\u0027t see you,\" Patrick explained. \"I heard you.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she whispered.\n \"What are you sorry for?\"\n \"For being loud,\" she answered. \"I only wanted a few minutes of privacy, but that isn\u0027t possible here, is it?\"\n She sounded downright pitiful. Patrick wanted to comfort her. She was his wife\u0027s dearest friend, and he felt it was his duty to try to make her feel better. He put his arm around her shoulders and gently turned her back to the path.\n \"Tell me what\u0027s wrong, Judith. No matter how terrible this problem seems to be, I\u0027m certain I can correct it for you.\"\n It was an extremely arrogant thing to say, but then, he was Iain\u0027s brother, after all, and some of his arrogance would surely dribble down to his sibling, she supposed. He was trying to be good-hearted, and for that reason alone she wasn\u0027t irritated.\n \"You cannot correct this,\" she told him. \"But I thank you for offering.\"\n \"You can\u0027t know what I can do until you explain.\"\n \"All right,\" she agreed. \"I\u0027ve only just realized how ignorant I am. Can you correct that?\"\n His smile was gentle. \"You aren\u0027t ignorant, Judith.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-highlands-lairds-1/page-25.html","bookId":1844,"book":{"id":1844,"title":"The Secret (Highlands\u0027 Lairds #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Judith Hampton was as beautiful as she was proud, as purposeful as she was loyal.
