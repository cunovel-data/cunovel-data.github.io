{"id":77626,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Here, because of the huge coastal swamps, nothing has happened since Columbus used Manatee Bay as a casual anchorage. Jamaican fishermen have taken the place of the Arawak Indians, but otherwise there is the impression that time has stood still.\\n\\n Bond thought it the most beautiful beach he had ever seen, five miles of white sand sloping easily into the breakers and, behind, the palm trees marching in graceful disarray to the horizon. Under them, the grey canoes were pulled up beside pink mounds of discarded conch shells, and among them smoke rose from the palm thatch cabins of the fishermen in the shade between the swamp-lands and the sea.\\n\\n In a clearing among the cabins, set on a rough lawn of Bahama grass, was the house on stilts built as a weekend cottage for the employees of the West Indian Citrus Company. It was built on stilts to keep the termites at bay and it was closely wired against mosquito and sand-fly. Bond drove off the rough track and parked under the house. While Quarrel chose two rooms and made them comfortable Bond put a towel round his waist and walked through the palm trees to the sea, twenty yards away.\\n\\n For an hour he swam and lazed in the warm buoyant water, thinking of Surprise and its secret, fixing these three hundred yards in his mind, wondering about the shark and barracuda and the other hazards of the sea, that great library of books one cannot read.\\n\\n Walking back to the little wooden bungalow, Bond picked up his first sandfly bites. Quarrel chuckled when he saw the flat bumps on his back that would soon start to itch maddeningly.\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t do nuthen to keep them away, Cap\u0027n,\u0027 he said. \u0027But Ah kin stop them ticklin\u0027. You best take a shower first to git the salt off. They only bites hard for an hour in the evenin\u0027 and then they likes salt with their dinner.\u0027\\n\\n When Bond came out of the shower Quarrel produced an old medicine bottle and swabbed the bites with a brown liquid that smelled of creosote.\\n\\n \u0027We get more skeeters and sandfly in the Caymans than anywheres else in the world,\u0027 he said, \u0027but we gives them no attention so long as we got this medicine.\u0027\\n\\n The ten minutes of tropical twilight brought its quick melancholy and then the stars and the three-quarter moon blazed down and the sea died to a whisper. There was the short lull between the two great winds of Jamaica, and then the palms began to whisper again.\\n\\n Quarrel jerked his head towards the window.\\n\\n \u0027De “Undertaker\u0027s Wind”,\u0027 he commented.\\n\\n \u0027How\u0027s that?\u0027 asked Bond, startled.\\n\\n \u0027On-and-off shore breeze de sailors call it,\u0027 said Quarrel.\\n\\n \u0027De Undertaker blow de bad air out of de Island nighttimes from six. till six. Then every morning de “Doctor\u0027s Wind” come and blow de sweet air in from de sea. Leastwise dat\u0027s what we calls dem in Jamaica.\u0027\\n\\n Quarrel looked quizzically at Bond.\\n\\n \u0027Guess you and de Undertaker\u0027s Wind got much de same job, Cap\u0027n,\u0027 he said half-seriously.\\n\\n Bond laughed shortly. \u0027Glad I don\u0027t have to keep the same hours,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Outside, the crickets and the tree-frogs started to zing and tinkle and the great hawkmoths came to the wire-netting across the windows and clutched it, gazing with trembling ecstasy at the two oil lamps that hung from the cross-beams inside.\\n\\n Occasionally a pair of fishermen, or a group of giggling girls, would walk by down the beach on their way to the single tiny rum-shop at the point of the bay. No man walked alone for fear of the duppies under the trees, or the rolling calf, the ghastly animal that comes rolling towards you along the ground, its legs in chains and flames coming out of its nostrils.\\n\\n While Quarrel prepared one of the succulent meals of fish and eggs and vegetables that were to be their staple diet, Bond sat under the light and pored over the books that Strangways had borrowed from the Jamaica Institute, books on the tropical sea and its denizens by Beebe and Allyn and others, and on sub-marine hunting by Gousteau and Hass. When he set out to cross those three hundred yards of sea, he was determined to do it expertly and to leave nothing to chance. He knew the calibre of Mr. Big and he guessed that the defences of Surprise would be technically brilliant. He thought they would not involve simple weapons like guns and high explosives. Mr. Big needed to work undisturbed by the police. He had to keep out of reach of the law. He guessed that somehow the forces of the sea had been harnessed to do The Big Man\u0027s work for him and it was on these that he concentrated, on murder by shark and barracuda, perhaps by Manta Ray and octopus.\\n\\n The facts set out by the naturalists were chilling and awe-inspiring, but the experiences of Cousteau in the Mediterranean and of Hass in the Red Sea and Caribbean were more encouraging.\\n\\n That night Bond\u0027s dreams were full of terrifying encounters with giant squids and sting rays, hammerheads and the saw-teeth of barracuda, so that he whimpered and sweated in his sleep.\\n\\n On the next day he started his training under the critical, appraising eyes of Quarrel. Every morning he swam a mile up the beach before breakfast and then ran back along the firm sand to the bungalow. At about nine they would set out in a canoe, the single triangular sail taking them fast through the water up the coast to Bloody Bay and Orange Bay where the sand ends in cliffs and small coves and the reef is close in against the coast.\\n\\n Here they would beach the canoe and Quarrel would take him out with spears and masks and an old underwater harpoon gun on breathtaking expeditions in the sort of waters he would encounter in Shark Bay.\\n\\n They hunted quietly, a few yards apart, Quarrel moving effortlessly in an element in which he was almost at home.\\n\\n Soon Bond too learned not to fight the sea but always to give and take with the currents and eddies and not to struggle against them, to use judo tactics in the water.\\n\\n On the first day he came home cut and poisoned by the coral and with a dozen sea-egg spines in his side. Quarrel grinned and treated the wounds with merthiolate and Milton. Then, as every evening, he massaged Bond for half an hour with palm oil, talking quietly the while about the fish they had seen that day, explaining the habits of the carnivores and the ground-feeders, the camouflage of fish and their machinery for changing colour through the blood stream.\\n\\n He also had never known fish to attack a man except in desperation or because there was blood in the water. He explained that fish are rarely hungry in tropical waters and that most of their weapons are for defence and not for attack. The only exception, he admitted, was the barracuda. \u0027Mean fish,\u0027 he called them, fearless since they knew no enemy except disease, capable of fifty miles an hour over short distances, and with the worst battery of teeth of any fish in the sea.\\n\\n One day they shot a ten-pounder that had been hanging round them, melting into the grey distances and then reappearing, silent, motionless in the upper water, its angry tiger\u0027s eyes glaring at them so close that they could see its gills working softly and the teeth glinting like a wolf\u0027s along its cruel underslung jaw.\\n\\n Quarrel finally took the harpoon gun from Bond and shot it, badly, through the streamlined belly. It came straight for them, its jaws on their great hinges wide open like a striking rattlesnake. Bond made a wild lunge at it with his spear just as it was on to Quarrel. He missed but the spear went between its jaws. They immediately snapped shut on the steel shaft, and as the fish tore the spear out of Bond\u0027s hand, Quarrel stabbed at it with his knife and it went mad, dashing through the water with its entrails hanging out, the spear clenched between its teeth, and the harpoon dangling from its body Quarrel could scarcely hold the line as the fish tried to tear the wide barb through the walls of its stomach, but he moved with it towards a piece of submerged reef and climbed on to it and slowly pulled the fish in.\\n\\n When Quarrel had cut its throat and they twisted the spear out of its jaws they found bright, deep scratches in the steel.\\n\\n They took the fish ashore and Quarrel cut its head off and opened the jaws with a piece of wood. The upper jaw rose in an enormous gape, almost at right angles to the lower, and revealed a fantastic battery of razor-sharp teeth, so crowded that they overlapped like shingles on a roof. Even the tongue had several runs of small pointed recurved teeth and, in front, there were two huge fangs that projected forward like a snake\u0027s.\\n\\n Although it only weighed just over ten pounds, it was over four feet long, a nickel bullet of muscle and hard flesh.\\n\\n \u0027We shoot no more cudas,\u0027 said Quarrel. \u0027But for you I been in hospital for a month and mebbe lost ma face. It was foolish of me. If we swim towards it, it gone away. Dey always do. Dey cowards like all fish. Doan you worry, bout those,\u0027 he pointed at the teeth. \u0027You never see dem again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I hope not,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I haven\u0027t got a face to spare.\u0027\\n\\n By the end of the week, Bond was sunburned and hard. He had cut his cigarettes down to ten a day and had not had a single drink. He could swim two miles without tiring, his hand was completely healed and all the scales of big city life had fallen from him.\\n\\n Quarrel was pleased. \u0027You ready for Surprise, Cap\u0027n,\u0027 he said, \u0027and I not like be de fish what tries to eat you.\u0027\\n\\n Towards nightfall on the eighth day they came back to the rest-house to find Strangways waiting for them.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got some good news for you,\u0027 he said : \u0027your friend Felix Leiter\u0027s going to be all right. At all events he\u0027s not going to die. They\u0027ve had to amputate the remains of an arm and a leg. Now the plastic surgery chaps have started building up his face. They called me up from St. Petersburg yesterday. Apparently he insisted on getting a message to you. First thing he thought of when he could think at all. Says he\u0027s sorry not to be with you and to tell you not to get your feet wet — or at any rate, not as wet as he did.\u0027\\n\\n Bond\u0027s heart was full. He looked out of the window. \u0027Tell him to get well quickly,\u0027 he said abruptly. \u0027Tell him I miss him.\u0027 He looked back into the room. \u0027Now what about the gear? Everything okay?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got it all,\u0027 said Strangways, \u0027and the Secatur sails tomorrow for Surprise. After clearing at Port Maria, they should anchor before nightfall. Mr. Big\u0027son board — only the second time he\u0027s been down here. Oh and they\u0027ve got a woman with them. Girl called Solitaire, according to the CIA. Know anything about her?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not much,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027But I\u0027d like to get her away from him. She\u0027s not one of his team.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sort of damsel in distress,\u0027 said the romantic Strangways. \u0027Good show. According to the CIA she\u0027s a corker.\u0027\\n\\n But Bond had gone out on the veranda and was gazing up at his stars. Never before in his life had there been so much to play for. The secret of the treasure, the defeat of a great criminal, the smashing of a Communist spy ring, and the destruction of a tentacle of SMERSH, the cruel machine that was his own private target. And now Solitaire, the ultimate personal prize.\\n\\n The stars winked down their cryptic morse and he had no key to their cipher.\\n\\n CHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n BEAU DESERT\\n\\n STRANGEWAYS went back alone after dinner and Bond agreed that they would follow at first light. Strangways left him a fresh pile of books and pamphlets on shark and barracuda and Bond went through them with rapt attention.\\n\\n They added little to the practical lore he had picked up from Quarrel. They were all by scientists and much of the data on attacks was from the beaches of the Pacific where a flashing body in the thick surf would excite any inquisitive fish.\\n\\n But there seemed to be general agreement that the danger to underwater swimmers with breathing equipment was far less than to surface swimmers. They might be attacked by almost any of the shark family, particularly when the shark was stimulated and excited by blood in the water, by the smell of a swimmer or by the sensory vibration set up by an injured person in the water. But they could sometimes be frightened off, he read, by loud noises in the water - even by shouting below the surface, and they would often flee if a swimmer chased them. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/live-and-let-die-james-bond-2/page-24.html","bookId":2425,"book":{"id":2425,"title":"Live and Let Die (James Bond #2)","description":"Storyline: Live and Let Die (James Bond (Original Series) #2) \\n \"Her hair was black and fell to her shoulders.
