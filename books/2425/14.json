Bond got out of his coat. He quietly slipped the wedges firmly under both doors. Then he lay down carefully on his right side on the comfortable bed and without a thought for the future fell into a deep sleep, lulled by the pounding gallop of the train. A few cars away, in the deserted diner, a negro waiter read again what he had written on a telegraph blank and waited for the ten-minute stop at Philadelphia. CHAPTER XI ALLUMEUSE THE crack train thundered on through the bright afternoon towards the south. They left Pennsylvania behind, and Maryland. There came a long halt at Washington, where Bond heard through his dreams the measured clang of the warning bells on the shunting engines and the soft think-speak of the public-address system on the station. Then on into Virginia. Here the air was already softer and the dusk, only five hours away from the bright frosty breath of New York , smelled almost of spring. An occasional group of negroes, walking home from the fields, would hear the distant rumble on the silent sighing silver rails and one would pull out his watch and consult it and announce, \u0027Hyah comes da Phantom. Six o\u0027clock. Guess ma watch is right on time.\u0027 \u0027Sho nuff,\u0027 one of the others would say as the great beat of the Diesels came nearer and the lighted coaches streaked past and on towards North Carolina. They awoke around seven to the hasty ting of a grade-crossing alarm bell as the big train nosed its way out of the fields into the suburbs of Raleigh. Bond pulled the wedges from under the doors before he turned on the lights and rang for the attendant. He ordered dry Martinis and when the two little \u0027personalized\u0027 bottles appeared with the glasses and the ice they seemed so inadequate that he at once ordered four more. They argued over the menu. The fish was described as being \u0027Made From Flaky Tender Boneless Filets\u0027 and the chicken as \u0027Delicious French Fried to a Golden Brown, Served Disjointed\u0027. \u0027Eyewash,\u0027 said Bond, and they finally ordered scrambled eggs and bacon and sausages, a salad, and some of the domestic Camembert that is one of the most welcome surprises on American menus. It was nine o\u0027clock when Baldwin came to clear the dishes away. He asked if there was anything else they wanted. Bond had been thinking. \u0027What time do we get into Jacksonville ?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Aroun\u0027 five \u0027n the morning, Suh.\u0027 \u0027Is there a subway on the platform?\u0027 \u0027Yassuh. Dis cyar stops right alongside.\u0027 \u0027Gould you have the door open and the steps down pretty quick?\u0027 The negro smiled. \u0027Yassuh. Ah kin take good care of that.\u0027 Bond slipped him a ten-dollar bill. \u0027Just in case I miss you when we arrive in St. Petersburg ,\u0027 he said. The negro grinned. \u0027Ah greatly preeshiate yo kindness, Suh. Good night, Suh. Good night, Mam.\u0027 He went out and closed the door. Bond got up and pushed the wedges firmly under the two doors. \u0027I see,\u0027 said Solitaire. \u0027So it\u0027s like that.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I\u0027m afraid so.\u0027 He told her of the warning he had had from Baldwin. \u0027I\u0027m not surprised,\u0027 said the girl when he had finished. \u0027They must have seen you coming into the station. He\u0027s got a whole team of spies called “The Eyes” and when they\u0027re put out on a job it\u0027s almost impossible to get by them. I wonder who he\u0027s got on the train. You can be certain it\u0027s a negro, either a Pullman attendant or someone in the diner. He can make these people do absolutely anything he likes.\u0027 \u0027So it seems,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027But how does it work? What\u0027s he got on them?\u0027 She looked out of the window into the tunnel of darkness through which the lighted train was burning its thundering path. Then she looked back across the table into the cool wide grey-blue eyes of the English agent. She thought: how can one explain to someone with that certainty of spirit, with that background of common sense, brought up with clothes and shoes among the warm houses and the lighted streets? How can one explain to someone who hasn\u0027t lived close to the secret heart of the tropics, at the mercy of their anger and stealth and poison; who hasn\u0027t experienced the mystery of the drums, seen the quick workings of magic and the mortal dread it inspires? What can he know of catalepsy, and thought-transference and the sixth sense of fish, of birds, of negroes; the deadly meaning of a white chicken\u0027s feather, a crossed stick in the road, a little leather bag of bones and herbs? What of Mialism, of shadow-taking, of the death by swelling and the death by wasting? She shivered and a whole host of dark memories clustered round her. Above all, she remembered that first time in the Houmfor where her black nurse had once taken her as a child. \u0027It do yuh no harm, Missy. Dis powerful good juju. Care fe yuh res \u0027f yo life.\u0027 And the disgusting old man and the filthy drink he had given her. How her nurse had held her jaws open until she had drunk the last drop and how she had lain awake screaming every night for a week. And how her nurse had been worried and then suddenly she had slept all right until, weeks later, shifting on her pillow, she had felt something hard and had dug it out from the pillow-case, a dirty little packet of muck. She had thrown it out of the window, but in the morning she could not find it. She had continued to sleep well and she knew it must have been found by the nurse and secreted somewhere under the floorboards. Years later, she had found out about the Voodoo drink -a concoction of rum, gunpowder, grave-dirt and human blood. She almost retched as the taste came back to her mouth. What could this man know of these things or of her half-belief in them? She looked up and found Bond\u0027s eyes fixed quizzically on her. \u0027You\u0027re thinking I shan\u0027t understand,\u0027 he said. \u0027And you\u0027re right up to a point. But I know what fear can do to people and I know that fear can be caused by many things. I\u0027ve read most of the books on Voodoo and I believe that it works. I don\u0027t think it would work on me because I stopped being afraid of the dark when I was a child and I\u0027m not a good subject for suggestion or hypnotism. But I know the jargon and you needn\u0027t think I shall laugh at it. The scientists and doctors who wrote the books don\u0027t laugh at it.\u0027 Solitaire smiled. \u0027All right,\u0027 she said. \u0027Then all I need tell you is that they believe The Big Man is the Zombie of Baron Samedi. Zombies are bad enough by themselves. They\u0027re animated corpses that have been made to rise from the dead and obey the commands of the person who controls them. Baron Samedi is the most dreadful spirit in the whole of Voodooism. He is the spirit of darkness and death. So for Baron Samedi to be in control of his own Zombie is a very dreadful conception. You know what Mr. Big looks like. He is huge and grey and he has great psychic power. It is not difficult for a negro to believe that he is a Zombie and a very bad one at that. The step to Baron Samedi is simple. Mr. Big encourages the idea by having the Baron\u0027s fetish at his elbow. You saw it in his room.\u0027 She paused. She went on quickly, almost breathlessly: \u0027And I can tell you that it works and that there\u0027s hardly a negro who has seen him and heard the story who doesn\u0027t believe it and who doesn\u0027t regard him with complete and absolute dread. And they are right,\u0027 she added. \u0027And you would say so too if you knew the way he deals with those who haven\u0027t obeyed him completely, the way they are tortured and killed.\u0027 \u0027Where does Moscow come in?\u0027 asked Bond. \u0027Is it true he\u0027s an agent of SMERSH?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know what SMERSH is,\u0027 said the girl, \u0027but I know he works for Russia, at least I\u0027ve heard him talking Russian to people who come from time to time. Occasionally he\u0027s had me in to that room and asked me afterwards what I thought of his visitors. Generally it seemed to me they were telling the truth although I couldn\u0027t understand what they said. But don\u0027t forget I\u0027ve only known him for a year and he\u0027s fantastically secretive. If Moscow does use him they\u0027ve got hold of one of the most powerful men in America . He can find out almost anything he wants to and if he doesn\u0027t get what he wants somebody gets killed.\u0027 \u0027Why doesn\u0027t someone kill him?\u0027 asked Bond. \u0027You can\u0027t kill him,\u0027 she said. \u0027He\u0027s already dead. He\u0027s a Zombie.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I see,\u0027 said Bond slowly. \u0027It\u0027s quite an impressive arrangement. Would you try?\u0027 She looked out of the window, then back at him. \u0027As a last resort,\u0027 she admitted unwillingly. \u0027But don\u0027t forget I come from Haiti. My brain tells me I could kill him, but…\u0027 She made a helpless gesture with her hands. \u0027… my instinct tells me I couldn\u0027t.\u0027 She smiled at him docilely. \u0027You must think me a hopeless fool,\u0027 she said. Bond reflected. \u0027Not after reading all those books,\u0027 he admitted. He put his hand across the table and covered hers with it. \u0027When the time comes,\u0027 he said, smiling, \u0027I\u0027ll cut a cross in my bullet. That used to work in the old days.\u0027 She looked thoughtful. \u0027I believe that if anybody can do it, you can,\u0027 she said. \u0027You hit him hard last night in exchange for what he did to you. She took his hand in hers and pressed it. \u0027Now tell me what I must do.\u0027 \u0027Bed,\u0027 said Bond. He looked at his watch. It was ten o\u0027clock. \u0027Might as well get as much sleep as we can. We\u0027ll slip off the train at Jacksonville and chance being spotted. Find another way down to the Coast.\u0027 They got up. They stood facing each other in the swaying train. Suddenly Bond reached out and took her in his right arm. Her arms went round his neck and they kissed passionately. He pressed her up against the swaying wall and held her there. She took his face between her two hands and held it away, panting. Her eyes were bright and hot. Then she brought his lips against hers again and kissed in him long and lasciviously, as if she was the man and he the woman. Bond cursed the broken hand that prevented him exploring her body, taking her. He freed his right hand and put it between their bodies, feeling her hard breasts, each with its pointed stigma of desire. He slipped it down her back until it came to the cleft at the base of her spine and he let it rest there, holding the centre of her body hard against him until they had kissed enough. She took her arms away from around his neck and pushed him away. \u0027I hoped I would one day kiss a man like that,\u0027 she said. \u0027And when I first saw you, I knew it would be you.\u0027 Her arms were down by her sides and her body stood there, open to him, ready for him. \u0027You\u0027re very beautiful,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027You kiss more wonderfully than any girl I have ever known.\u0027 He looked down at the bandages on his left hand. \u0027Curse this arm,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can\u0027t hold you properly or make love to you. It hurts too much. That\u0027s something else Mr. Big\u0027s got to pay for.\u0027 She laughed. She took a handkerchief out of her bag and wiped the lipstick off his mouth. Then she brushed the hair away from his forehead, and kissed him again, lightly and tenderly. \u0027It\u0027s just as well,\u0027 she said. \u0027There are too many other things on our minds.\u0027 The train rocked him back against her. He put his hand on her left breast and kissed her white throat. Then he kissed her mouth. He felt the pounding of his blood softening. He took her by the hand and drew her out into the middle of the little swaying room. He smiled. \u0027Perhaps you\u0027re right,\u0027 he said. \u0027When the time comes I want to be alone with you, with all the time in the world. Here there is at least one man who will probably disturb our night. And we\u0027ll have to be up at four in the morning anyway. So there simply isn\u0027t time to begin making love to you now. You get ready for bed and I\u0027ll climb up after you and kiss you good night.\u0027 They kissed once more, slowly, then he stepped away. \u0027We\u0027ll just see if we have company next door,\u0027 he said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/live-and-let-die-james-bond-2/page-14.html","bookId":2425,"book":{"id":2425,"title":"Live and Let Die (James Bond #2)","description":"Storyline: Live and Let Die (James Bond (Original Series) #2) \"Her hair was black and fell to her shoulders.
