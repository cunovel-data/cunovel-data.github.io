{"id":77610,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"They finished their drinks and Bond called for the check.\\n\\n \u0027All this evening\u0027s on me,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ve got a lot of money to get rid of and I\u0027ve brought three hundred dollars of it along with me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Suits me,\u0027 said Leiter, who knew about Bond\u0027s thousand dollars.\\n\\n As the waiter was picking up the change, Leiter suddenly said, \u0027Know where The Big Man\u0027s operating tonight?\u0027\\n\\n The waiter showed the whites of his eyes.\\n\\n He leant forward and flicked the table down with his napkin.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got a wife\u0027n kids, Boss,\u0027 he muttered out of the corner of his mouth. He stacked the glasses on his tray and went back to the bar.\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Big\u0027s got the best protection of all,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Fear.”\\n\\n They went out on to Seventh Avenue. The rain had stopped, but \u0027Hawkins\u0027, the bone-chilling wind from the north which the negroes greet with a reverent \u0027Hawkins is here\u0027, had come instead to keep the streets free of their usual crowds. Leiter and Bond moved with the trickle of couples on the sidewalk. The looks they got were mostly contemptuous or frankly hostile. One or two men spat in the gutter when they had passed.\\n\\n Bond suddenly felt the force of what Leiter had told him. They were trespassing. They just weren\u0027t wanted. Bond felt the uneasiness that he had known so well during the war, when he had been working for a time behind the enemy lines. He shrugged the feeling away.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll go to Ma Frazier\u0027s, further up the Avenue,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Best food in Harlem , or at any rate it used to be.\u0027\\n\\n As they went along Bond gazed into the shop windows.\\n\\n He was struck by the number of barbers\u0027 saloons and \u0027beauticians\u0027. They all advertised various forms of hair-straightener — \u0027Apex Glossatina, for use with the hot comb\u0027, \u0027Silky Strate. Leaves no redness, no burn\u0027 - or nostrums for bleaching the skin. Next in frequency were the haberdashers and clothes shops, with fantastic men\u0027s snakeskin shoes, shirts with small aeroplanes as a pattern, peg-top trousers with inch-wide stripes, zoot suits. All the book shops were full of educational literature - how to learn this, how to do that - and comics. There were several shops devoted to lucky charms and various occultisms — Seven Keys to Power, \u0027The Strangest book ever written\u0027, with sub-titles such as: \u0027If you are CROSSED, shows you how to remove and cast it back.\u0027 \u0027Chant your desires in the Silent Tongue.\u0027 \u0027Cast a Spell on Anyone, no matter where.\u0027 \u0027Make any person Love you.\u0027 Among the charms were \u0027High John the Conqueror Root\u0027, \u0027Money Drawing Brand Oil\u0027, \u0027Sachet Powders, Uncrossing Brand\u0027, Tncense, Jinx removing Brand\u0027, and the \u0027Lucky Whamie Hand Charm, giving Protection from Evil. Confuses and Baffles Enemies\u0027.\\n\\n Bond reflected it was no wonder that the Big Man found Voodooism such a powerful weapon on minds that still recoiled at a white chicken\u0027s feather or crossed sticks in the road - right in the middle of the shining capital city of the Western world.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m glad we came up here,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I\u0027m beginning to get the hang of Mr. Big. One just doesn\u0027t catch the smell of all this in a country like England . We\u0027re a superstitious lot there of course — particularly the Celts — but here one can almost hear the drums.\u0027\\n\\n Leiter grunted. \u0027I\u0027ll be glad to get back to my bed,\u0027 he said. \u0027But we need to size up this guy before we decide how to get at him.\u0027\\n\\n Ma Frazier\u0027s was a cheerful contrast to the bitter streets. They had an excellent meal of Little Neck Clams and Fried Chicken Maryland with bacon and sweet corn. \u0027We\u0027ve got to have it,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027It\u0027s the national dish.\u0027\\n\\n It was very civilized in the warm restaurant. Their waiter seemed glad to see them and pointed out various celebrities, but when Leiter slipped in a question about Mr. Big the waiter seemed not to hear. He kept away from them until they called for their bill.\\n\\n Leiter repeated the question.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry, Sah,\u0027 said the waiter briefly. \u0027Ah cain\u0027t recall a gemmun of dat name.\u0027\\n\\n By the time they left the restaurant it was ten-thirty and the Avenue was almost deserted. They took a cab to the Savoy Ballroom, had a Scotch-and-soda, and watched the dancers.\\n\\n \u0027Most modern dances were invented here,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027That\u0027s how good it is. The Lindy Hop, Truckin\u0027, the Susie Q, the Shag. All started on that floor. Every big American band you\u0027ve ever heard of is proud that it once played here - Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Cab Galloway, Noble Sissle, Fletcher Henderson. It\u0027s the Mecca of jazz and jive.\u0027\\n\\n They had a table near the rail round the huge floor. Bond was spellbound. He found many of the girls very beautiful. The music hammered its way into his pulse until he almost forgot what he was there for.\\n\\n \u0027Gets you, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Leiter at last. \u0027I could stay here all night. Better move along. We\u0027ll miss out Small\u0027s Paradise. Much the same as this, but not quite in the same class. Think I\u0027ll take you to “Yeah Man”, back on Seventh. After that we must get moving to one of Mr. Big\u0027s own joints. Trouble is, they don\u0027t open till midnight. I\u0027ll pay a visit to the washroom while you get the check. See if I can get a line on where we\u0027re likely to find him tonight. We don\u0027t want to have to go to all his places.\u0027\\n\\n Bond paid the check and met Leiter downstairs in the narrow entrance hall.\\n\\n Leiter drew him outside and they walked up the street looking for a cab.\\n\\n \u0027Cost me twenty bucks,\u0027 said Leiter, \u0027but the word is he\u0027ll be at The Boneyard. Small place on Lenox Avenue. Quite close to his headquarters. Hottest strip in town. Girl called G-G Sumatra. We\u0027ll have another drink at “Yeah Man” and hear the piano. Move on at about twelve-thirty.\u0027\\n\\n The big switchboard, now only a few blocks away, was almost quiet. The two men had been checked in and out of Sugar Ray\u0027s, Ma Frazier\u0027s and the Savoy Ballroom.\\n\\n Midnight had them entering \u0027Yeah Man\u0027. At twelve-thirty the final call came and then the board was silent.\\n\\n Mr. Big spoke on the house-phone. First to the head waiter.\\n\\n \u0027Two white men coming in five minutes. Give them the Z table.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Sir, Boss,\u0027 said the head waiter. He hurried across the dance-floor to a table away on the right, obscured from most of the room by a wide pillar. It was next to the Service entrance but with a good view of the floor and the band opposite.\\n\\n It was occupied by a party of four, two men and two girls \u0027Sorry folks,\u0027 said the head waiter. \u0027Been a mistake. Table\u0027s reserved. Newspaper men from downtown.\u0027\\n\\n One of the men began to argue.\\n\\n \u0027Move, Bud,\u0027 said the head waiter crisply. \u0027Lofty, show these folks to table F. Drinks is on the house. Sam,\u0027 he beckoned to another waiter, \u0027clear the table. Two covers.\u0027 The party of four moved docilely away, mollified by the prospect of free liquor. The head waiter put a Reserved sign on table Z, surveyed it and returned to his post at his table-plan on the high desk beside the curtained entrance.\\n\\n Meanwhile Mr. Big had made two more calls on the house-phone. One to the Master of Ceremonies.\\n\\n \u0027Lights out at the end of G-G\u0027s act.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Sir, Boss,\u0027 said the MC with alacrity.\\n\\n The other call was to four men who were playing craps in the basement. It was a long call, and very detailed.\\n\\n CHAPTER VI\\n\\n TABLE Z\\n\\n At twelve forty-five Bond and Leiter paid off their cab and walked in under the sign which announced \u0027The Boneyard\u0027 in violet and green neon.\\n\\n The thudding rhythm and the sour-sweet smell rocked them as they pushed through the heavy curtains inside the swing door. The eyes of the hat-check girls glowed and beckoned.\\n\\n \u0027Have you reserved, Sir?\u0027 asked the head waiter.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027We don\u0027t mind sitting at the bar.\u0027\\n\\n The head waiter consulted his table-plan. He seemed to decide. He put his pencil firmly through a space at the end of the card.\\n\\n \u0027Party hasn\u0027t shown. Guess Ah cain\u0027t hold their res\u0027vation all night. This way, please.\u0027 He held his card high over his head and led them round the small crowded dance-floor. He pulled out one of the two chairs and removed the \u0027Reserved\u0027 sign.\\n\\n \u0027Sam,\u0027 he called a waiter over. \u0027Look after these gem-mums order.\u0027 He moved away.\\n\\n They ordered Scotch-and-soda and chicken sandwiches.\\n\\n Bond sniffed. \u0027Marihuana,” he commented.\\n\\n \u0027Most of the real hep-cats smoke reefers,\u0027 explained Leiter. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t be allowed most places.\u0027\\n\\n Bond looked round. The music had stopped. The small four-piece band, clarinet, double-bass, electric guitar and drums, was moving out of the corner opposite. The dozen or so couples were walking and jiving to their tables and the crimson light was turned off under the glass dance-floor. Instead, pencil-thin lights in the roof came on and hit coloured glass witchballs, larger than footballs, that hung at intervals round the wall. They were of different hues, golden, blue, green, violet, red. As the beams of light hit them, they glowed like coloured suns. The walls, varnished black, mirrored their reflections as did the sweat on the ebony faces of the men. Sometimes a man sitting between two lights showed cheeks of different colour, green on one side, perhaps, and red on the other. The lighting made it impossible to distinguish features unless they were only a few feet away. Some of the lights turned the girls\u0027 lipstick black, others lit their whole faces in a warm glow on one side and gave the other profile the luminosity of a drowned corpse.\\n\\n The whole scene was macabre and livid, as if El Greco had done a painting by moonlight of an exhumed graveyard in a burning town.\\n\\n It was not a large room, perhaps sixty foot square. There were about fifty tables and the customers were packed in like black olives in a jar. It was hot and the air was thick with smoke and the sweet, feral smell of two hundred negro bodies. The noise was terrific - an undertone of the jabber of negroes enjoying themselves without restraint, punctuated by sharp bursts of noise, shouts and high giggles, as loud voices called to each other across the room.\\n\\n \u0027Sweet Jeessus, look who\u0027s hyar…\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where you been keepin yoself, baby…\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Gawd\u0027s troof. It\u0027s Pinkus… Hi Pinkus…\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cmon over…\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lemme be… Lemme be, Fse telling ya…\u0027 (The noise of a slap.)\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s G-G. Cmon G-G. Strut yo stuff…\u0027\\n\\n From time to time a man or girl would erupt on to the dance-floor and start a wild solo jive. Friends would clap the rhythm. There would be a burst of catcalls and whistles. If it was a girl, there would be cries of \u0027Strip, strip, strip,\u0027 \u0027Get hot, baby!\u0027 \u0027Shake it, shake it,\u0027 and the MC would come out and clear the floor amidst groans and shouts of derision.\\n\\n The sweat began to bead on Bond\u0027s forehead. Leiter leant over and cupped his hands. \u0027Three exits. Front. Service behind us. Behind the band.\u0027 Bond nodded. At that moment he felt it didn\u0027t matter. This was nothing new to Leiter, but for Bond it was a close-up of the raw material on which The Big Man worked, the clay in his hands. The evening was gradually putting flesh on the dossiers he had read in London and New York . If the evening ended now, without any closer sight of Mr. Big himself, Bond still felt his education in the case would be almost complete. He took a deep draught of his whisky. There was a burst of applause. The MC had come out on to the dance-floor, a tall negro in immaculate tails with a red carnation in his button hole. He stood, holding up his hands. A single white spotlight caught him. The rest of the room went dark.\\n\\n There was silence.\\n\\n \u0027Folks,\u0027 announced the MG with a broad flash of gold and white teeth. \u0027This is it.\u0027\\n\\n There was excited clapping.\\n\\n He turned to the left of the floor, directly across from Leiter and Bond.\\n\\n He flung out his right hand. Another spot came on.\\n\\n \u0027Mistah Jungles Japhet \u0027n his drums.\u0027\\n\\n A crash of applause, catcalls, whistles.\\n\\n Four grinning negroes in flame-coloured shirts and peg-top white trousers were revealed, squatting astride four tapering barrels with rawhide membranes. The drums were of different sizes. The negroes were all gaunt and stringy. The one sitting astride the bass drum rose briefly and shook clasped hands at the spectators. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/live-and-let-die-james-bond-2/page-7.html","bookId":2425,"book":{"id":2425,"title":"Live and Let Die (James Bond #2)","description":"Storyline: Live and Let Die (James Bond (Original Series) #2) \\n \"Her hair was black and fell to her shoulders.
