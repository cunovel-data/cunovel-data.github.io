Bond told him of the black sedan on 55th Street. \u0027But the point is,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027how did he know what I was here for? Shows he\u0027s got Washington pretty well sewn up. Must be a leak the size of the Grand Canyon somewhere.\u0027 \u0027Why should it be Washington?\u0027 asked Dexter testily. \u0027Anyway,\u0027 he controlled himself with a forced laugh, \u0027Hell and damnation. Have to make a report to Headquarters on this. So long, Mr. Bond. Glad you came to no harm.\u0027 \u0027Thanks,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027It was just a visiting-card. I must return the compliment.\u0027 CHAPTER IV THE BIG SWITCHBOARD WHEN Dexter and his colleague had gone, taking the remains of the bomb with them, Bond took a damp towel and rubbed the smoke-mark off the wall. Then he rang for the waiter and, without explanation, told him to put the broken glass on his check and clear away the breakfast things. Then he took his hat and coat and went out on the street. He spent the morning on Fifth Avenue and on Broadway, wandering aimlessly, gazing into the shop windows and watching the passing crowds. He gradually assimilated the casual gait and manners of a visitor from out of town, and when he tested himself out in a few shops and asked the way of several people he found that nobody looked at him twice. He had a typical American meal at an eating house called \u0027Gloryfried Ham-N-Eggs\u0027 (\u0027The Eggs We Serve Tomorrow Are Still in the Hens\u0027) on Lexington Avenue and then took a cab downtown to police headquarters, where he was due to meet Leiter and Dexter at 2.30. A Lieutenant Binswanger of Homicide, a suspicious and crusty officer in his late forties, announced that Commissioner Monahan had said that they were to have complete co-operation from the Police Department. What could he do for them? They examined Mr. Big\u0027s police record, which more or less duplicated Dexter\u0027s information, and they were shown the records and photographs of most of his known associates. They went over the reports of the US Coastguard Service on the comings and goings of the yacht Secatur and also the comments of the US Customs Service, who had kept a close watch on the boat each time she had docked at St. Petersburg. These confirmed that the yacht had put in at irregular intervals over the previous six months and that she always tied up in the Port of St. Petersburg at the wharf of the \u0027Ourobouros Worm and Bait Shippers Inc.\u0027, an apparently innocent concern whose main business was to sell live bait to fishing clubs throughout Florida, the Gulf of Mexico and further afield. The company also had a profitable sideline in sea-shells and coral for interior decoration, and a further sideline in tropical aquarium fish—particularly rare poisonous species for the research departments of medical and chemical foundations. According to the proprietor, a Greek sponge-fisher from the neighbouring Tarpon Springs, the Secatur did big business with his company, bringing in cargoes of queen conchs and other shells from Jamaica and also highly prized varieties of tropical fish. These were purchased by Ourobouros Inc., stored in their warehouse and sold in bulk to wholesalers and retailers up and down the coast. The name of the Greek was Papagos. No criminal record. The FBI, with the help of Naval Intelligence, had tried listening in to the Secatur\u0027s wireless. But she kept off the air except for short messages before she sailed from Cuba or Jamaica and then transmitted en clair in a language which was unknown and completely indecipherable. The last notation on the file was to the effect that the operator was talking in \u0027Language\u0027, the secret Voodoo speech only used by initiates, and that every effort would be made to hire an expert from Haiti before the next sailing. \u0027More gold been turning up lately,\u0027 announced Lieutenant Binswanger as they walked back to his office from the Identification Bureau across the street. \u0027 \u0027Bout a hundred coins a week in Harlem and New York alone. Want us to do anything about it? If you\u0027re right and these are Commie funds, they must be pulling it in pretty fast while we sit on our asses doin\u0027 nothing.\u0027 \u0027Chief says to lay off,\u0027 said Dexter. \u0027Hope we\u0027ll see some action before long.\u0027 \u0027Well, the case is all yours,\u0027 said Binswanger grudgingly. \u0027But the Commissioner sure don\u0027t like having this bastard crappin\u0027 away on his own front doorstep while Mr. Hoover sits down in Washington well to leeward of the stink. Why don\u0027t we pull him in on tax evasion or misuse of the mails or parkin\u0027 in front of a hydrant or sumpn? Take him down to the Tombs and give\u0027em the works? If the Feds won\u0027t do it, we\u0027d be glad to oblige.\u0027 \u0027D\u0027you want a race riot?\u0027 objected Dexter sourly. \u0027There\u0027s nothing against him and you know it, and we know it. If he wasn\u0027t sprung in half an hour by that black mouthpiece of his, those Voodoo drums would start beating from here to the Deep South. When they\u0027re full of that stuff we all know what happens. Remember \u002735 and \u002743? You\u0027d have to call out the Militia. We didn\u0027t ask for the case. The President gave it us and we\u0027ve got to stick with it.\u0027 They were back in Binswanger\u0027s drab office. They picked up their coats and hats. \u0027Anyway, thanks for the help, Lootenant,\u0027 said Dexter with forced cordiality, as they made their farewells. \u0027Been most valuable.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re welcome,\u0027 said Binswanger stonily. \u0027Elevator\u0027s to your right.\u0027 He closed the door firmly behind them. Leiter winked at Bond behind Dexter\u0027s back. They rode down to the main entrance on Centre Street in silence. On the sidewalk, Dexter turned to them. \u0027Had some instructions from Washington this morning,\u0027 he said unemotionally. \u0027Seems I\u0027m to look after the Harlem end, and you two are to go down to St. Petersburg tomorrow. Leiter\u0027s to find out what he can there and then move right on to Jamaica with you, Mr. Bond. That is,\u0027 he added, \u0027if you\u0027d care to have him along. It\u0027s your territory.\u0027 \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I was going to ask if he could come anyway.\u0027 \u0027Fine,\u0027 said Dexter. Then I\u0027ll tell Washington everything\u0027s fixed. Anything else I can do for you? All communications with FBI, Washington, of course. Leiter\u0027s got the names of our men in Florida , knows the Signals routine and so forth.\u0027 \u0027If Leiter\u0027s interested and if you don\u0027t mind,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027I\u0027d like very much to get up to Harlem this evening and have a look round. Might help to have some idea of what it looks like in Mr. Big\u0027s back yard.\u0027 Dexter reflected. \u0027Okay,\u0027 he said finally. \u0027Probably no harm. But don\u0027t show yourselves too much. And don\u0027t get hurt,\u0027 lie added. \u0027There\u0027s no one to help you up there. And don\u0027t go stirring up a lot of trouble for us. This case isn\u0027t ripe yet. Until it is, our policy with Mr. Big is “live and let live”.\u0027 Bond looked quizzically at Captain Dexter. \u0027In my job,\u0027 he said, \u0027when I come up against a man like this one, I have another motto. It\u0027s “live and let die”.\u0027 Dexter shrugged his shoulders. \u0027Maybe,\u0027 he said, \u0027but you\u0027re under my orders here, Mr. Bond, and I\u0027d be glad if you\u0027d accept them.\u0027 \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027and thanks for all your help. Hope you have luck with your end of the job.\u0027 Dexter flagged a cab. They shook hands. \u0027Bye, fellers,\u0027 said Dexter briefly. \u0027Stay alive.\u0027 His cab pulled out into the uptown traffic. Bond and Leiter smiled at each other. \u0027Able guy, I should say,\u0027 said Bond. They\u0027re all that in his show,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Bit inclined to be stuffed shirts. Very touchy about their rights. Always bickering with us or with the police. But I guess you have much the same problem in England .\u0027 \u0027Oh of course,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027We\u0027re always rubbing MI 5 up the wrong way. And they\u0027re always stepping on the corns of the Special Branch. Scotland Yard,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Well, how about going up to Harlem tonight?\u0027 \u0027Suits me,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027I\u0027ll drop you at the St. Regis and pick you up again about six-thirty. Meet you in the King Cole Bar, on the ground floor. Guess you want to take a look at Mr. Big,\u0027 he grinned. \u0027Well, so do I, but it wouldn\u0027t have done to tell Dexter so.\u0027 He flagged a Yellow Cab. \u0027St. Regis Hotel. Fifth at 55th.\u0027 They climbed into the overheated tin box reeking of last week\u0027s cigar-smoke. Leiter wound down a window. \u0027Whaddya want ter do?\u0027 asked the driver over his shoulder. \u0027Gimme pneumony?\u0027 \u0027Just that,\u0027 said Leiter, \u0027if it means saving us from this gas chamber.\u0027 \u0027Wise guy, hn?\u0027 said the driver, crashing tinnily through his gears. He took the chewed end of a cigar from behind his ear and held it up. \u0027Two bits for three,\u0027 he said in a hurt voice. \u0027Twenty-four cents too much,\u0027 said Leiter. The rest of the drive was passed in silence. They parted at the hotel and Bond went up to his room. It was four o\u0027clock. He asked the telephone operator to call him at six. For a while he looked out of the window of his bedroom. To his left, the sun was setting in a blaze of colour. In the skyscrapers the lights were coming on, turning the whole town into a golden honeycomb. Far below the streets were rivers of neon lighting, crimson, blue, green. The wind sighed sadly outside in the velvet dusk, lending his room still more warmth and security and luxury. He drew the curtains and turned on the soft lights over his bed. Then he took off his clothes and climbed between the fine percale sheets. He thought of the bitter weather in the London streets, the grudging warmth of the hissing gas-fire in his office at Headquarters, the chalked-up menu on the pub he had passed on his last day in London : \u0027Giant Toad \u0026 2 Veg.\u0027 He stretched luxuriously. Very soon he was asleep. Up in Harlem , at the big switchboard, \u0027The Whisper\u0027 was dozing over his racing form. All his lines were quiet. Suddenly a light shone on the right of the board - an important light. \u0027Yes, Boss,\u0027 he said softly into his headphone. He couldn\u0027t have spoken any louder if he had wished to. He had been born on \u0027Lung Block\u0027, on Seventh Avenue , at 142nd Street, where death from TB is twice as high as anywhere in New York . Now, he only had part of one lung left. \u0027Tell all “Eyes”,\u0027 said a slow, deep voice,\u0027 to watch out from now on. Three men.\u0027 A brief description of Leiter, Bond and Dexter followed. \u0027May be coming in this evening or tomorrow. Tell them to watch particularly on First to Eight and the other Avenues. The night spots too, in case they\u0027re missed coming in. They\u0027re not to be molested. Call me when you get a sure fix. Got it?\u0027 \u0027Yes, Sir, Boss,\u0027 said The Whisper, breathing fast. The voice went quiet. The operator took the whole handful of plugs, and soon the big switchboard was alive with winking lights. Softly, urgently, he whispered on into the evening. At six o\u0027clock Bond was awakened by the soft burr of the telephone. He took a cold shower and dressed carefully. He put on a garishly striped tie and allowed a broad wedge of bandana to protrude from his breast pocket. He slipped the chamois leather holster over his shirt so that it hung three inches below his left armpit. He whipped at the mechanism of the Beretta until all eight bullets lay on the bed. Then he packed them back into the magazine, loaded the gun, put up the safety-catch and slipped it into the holster. He picked up the pair of Moccasin casuals, felt their toes and weighed them in his hand. Then he reached under the bed and pulled out a pair of his own shoes he had carefully kept out of the suitcase full of his belongings the FBI had taken away from him that morning. He put them on and felt better equipped to face the evening. Under the leather, the toe-caps were lined with steel.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/live-and-let-die-james-bond-2/page-5.html","bookId":2425,"book":{"id":2425,"title":"Live and Let Die (James Bond #2)","description":"Storyline: Live and Let Die (James Bond (Original Series) #2) \"Her hair was black and fell to her shoulders.
