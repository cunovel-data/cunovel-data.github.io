{"id":77616,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\u0027I\u0027m glad I did,\u0027 said Bond inadequately, his mind trying to grapple with the mystery of this woman. He dug in his pocket for his cigarettes and lighter. It was a new pack of Chesterfields and with his right hand he scrabbled at the cellophane wrapper.\n She reached over and took the pack from him. She slit it with her thumb-nail, took out a cigarette, lit it and handed it to him. Bond took it from her and smiled into her eyes, tasting the hint of lipstick from her mouth.\n \u0027I smoke about three packs a day,\u0027 he said. \u0027You\u0027re going to be busy.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll just help with the new packs,\u0027 she said. \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid I\u0027m going to fuss over you the whole way to St. Petersburg .\u0027\n Bond\u0027s eyes narrowed and the smile went out of them.\n \u0027You don\u0027t believe I thought we were only going as far as Washington ,\u0027 she said. \u0027You weren\u0027t very quick on the telephone this morning. And anyway, Mr. Big was certain you would make for Florida . I heard him warning his people down there about you. He spoke to a man called “The Robber”, long distance. Said to watch the airport at Tampa and the trains. Perhaps we ought to get off the train earlier, at Tarpon Springs or one of the small stations up the coast. Did they see you getting on the train?\u0027\n \u0027Not that I know of,\u0027 said Bond. His eyes had relaxed again. \u0027How about you? Have any trouble getting away?\u0027\n \u0027It was my day for a singing lesson. He\u0027s trying to make a torch singer out of me. Wants me to go on at The Bone-yard. One of his men took me to my teacher as usual and was due to pick me up again at midday. He wasn\u0027t surprised I was having a lesson so early. I often have breakfast with my teacher so as to get away from Mr. Big. He expects me to have all my meals with him.\u0027 She looked at her watch. He noted cynically that it was an expensive one - diamonds and platinum, Bond guessed. \u0027They\u0027ll be missing me in about an hour. I waited until the car had gone, then I walked straight out again and called you. Then I took a cab downtown. I bought a toothbrush and a few other things at a drugstore. Otherwise I\u0027ve got nothing except my jewellery and the mad money I\u0027ve always kept hidden from him. About five thousand dollars. So I won\u0027t be a financial burden.\u0027 She smiled. \u0027I thought I\u0027d get my chance one day.\u0027 She gestured towards the window. \u0027You\u0027ve given me a new life. I\u0027ve been shut up with him and his nigger gangsters for nearly a year. This is heaven.\u0027\n The train was running through the unkempt barren plains and swamps between New York and Trenton. It wasn\u0027t an attractive prospect. It reminded Bond of some of the stretches on the pre-war Trans-Siberian Railway except for the huge lonely hoardings advertising the current Broadway shows and the occasional dumps of scrap-iron and old motor cars.\n \u0027I hope I can find you something better than that,\u0027 he said smiling. \u0027But don\u0027t thank me. We\u0027re quits now. You saved my life last night. That is,\u0027 he added looking at her curiously, \u0027if you really have got second sight.\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said, \u0027I have. Or something very like it. I can often see what\u0027s going to happen, particularly to other people. Of course I embroider on it and when I was earning my living doing it in Haiti it was easy to turn it into a good cabaret act. They\u0027re riddled with Voodoo and superstitions there and they were quite certain I was a witch. But I promise that when I first saw you in that room I knew you had been sent to save me. I,\u0027 she blushed, \u0027I saw all sorts of things.\u0027\n \u0027What sort of things?\u0027\n \u0027Oh I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she said, her eyes dancing. \u0027Just things. Anyway, we\u0027ll see. But it\u0027s going to be difficult,\u0027 she added seriously, \u0027and dangerous. For both of us.\u0027 She paused. \u0027So will you please take good care of us?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll do my best,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027The first thing is for us both to get some sleep. Let\u0027s have a drink and some chicken sandwiches and then we\u0027ll get the porter to put our beds down. You mustn\u0027t be embarrassed,\u0027 he added, seeing her eyes recoil. \u0027We\u0027re in this together. We have to spend twenty-four hours in a double bedroom together, and it\u0027s no good being squeamish. Anyway, you\u0027re Mrs. Bryce,\u0027 he grinned, \u0027and you must just act like her. Up to a point anyway,\u0027 he added.\n She laughed. Her eyes speculated. She said nothing but rang the bell below the window.\n The conductor arrived at the same time as the Pullman attendant. Bond ordered Old Fashioneds, and stipulated \u0027Old Grandad\u0027 Bourbon, chicken sandwiches, and decaffeined \u0027Sanka\u0027 coffee so that their sleep would not be spoilt.\n \u0027I have to collect another fare from you, Mr. Bryce,\u0027 said the conductor.\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Bond. Solitaire made a movement towards her handbag. \u0027It\u0027s all right, darling,\u0027 said Bond, pulling out his notecase. \u0027You\u0027ve forgotten you gave me your money to look after before we left the house.\u0027\n \u0027Guess the lady\u0027ll need plenty for her summer frocks,\u0027 said the conductor. \u0027Shops is plenty expensive in St. Pete. Plenty hot down there too. You folks been to Florida before?”\n \u0027We always go at this time of year,\u0027 said Bond.\n \u0027Hope you have a pleasant trip,\u0027 said the conductor.\n When the door shut behind him, Solitaire laughed delightedly.\n \u0027You can\u0027t embarrass me,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027ll think up something really fierce if you\u0027re not careful. To begin with, I\u0027m going in there,\u0027 she gestured towards the door behind Bond\u0027s head. \u0027I must look terrible.\u0027\n \u0027Go ahead, darling,\u0027 laughed Bond as she disappeared.\n Bond turned to the window and watched the pretty clapboard houses slip by as they approached Trenton. He loved trains and he looked forward with excitement to the rest of the journey.\n The train was slowing down. They slid past sidings full of “empty freight cars bearing names from all over the States - \u0027Lackawanna\u0027, \u0027Chesapeake and Ohio\u0027, \u0027Lehigh Valley\u0027, \u0027Seaboard Fruit Express\u0027, and the lilting \u0027Acheson, Topeka and Santa Fe\u0027 — names that held all the romance of the American railroads.\n \u0027British Railways?\u0027 thought Bond. He sighed and turned his thoughts back to the present adventure.\n For better or worse he had decided to accept Solitaire, or rather, in his cold way, to make the most of her. There were many questions to be answered but now was not the time to ask them. All that immediately concerned him was that another blow had been struck at Mr. Big — where it would hurt most, in his vanity.\n As for the girl, as a girl, he reflected that it was going to be fun teasing her and being teased back and he was glad that they had already crossed the frontiers into comradeship and even intimacy.\n Was it true what The Big Man had said, that she would have nothing to do with men? He doubted it. She seemed open to love and to desire. At any rate he knew she was not closed to him. He wanted her to come back and sit down opposite him again so that he could look at her and play with her and slowly discover her. Solitaire. It was an attractive name. No wonder they had christened her that in the sleazy nightclubs of Port au Prince. Even in her present promise of warmth towards him there was much that was withdrawn and mysterious. He sensed a lonely childhood on some great decaying plantation, an echoing \u0027Great House\u0027 slowly falling into disrepair and being encroached on by the luxuriance of the tropics. The parents dying, and the property being sold. The companionship of a servant or two and an equivocal life in lodgings in the capital. The beauty which was her only asset and the struggle against the shady propositions to be a \u0027governess\u0027, a \u0027companion\u0027, a\u0027secretary\u0027, all of which meant respectable prostitution. Then the dubious, unknown steps into the world of entertainment. The evening stint at the nightclub with the mysterious act which, among people dominated by magic, must have kept many away from her and made her a person to be feared. And then, one evening, the huge man with the grey face sitting at a table by himself. The promise that he would put her on Broadway. The chance of a new life, of an escape from the heat and the dirt and the solitude.\n Bond turned brusquely away from the window. A romantic picture, perhaps. But it must have been something like that.\n He heard the door unlock. The girl came back and slid into the seat opposite him. She looked fresh and gay. She examined him carefully.\n \u0027You have been wondering about me,\u0027 she said. \u0027I felt it. Don\u0027t worry. There is nothing very bad to know. I will tell you all about it some day. When we have time. Now I want to forget about the past. I will just tell you my real name. It is Simone Latrelle, but you can call me what you like. I am twenty-five. And now I am happy. I like this little room. But I am hungry and sleepy. Which bed will you have?\u0027\n Bond smiled at the question. He reflected.\n \u0027It\u0027s not very gallant,\u0027 he said, \u0027but I think I\u0027d better have the bottom one. I\u0027d rather be close to the floor - just in case. Not that there\u0027s anything to worry about,\u0027 he added, seeing her frown, \u0027but Mr. Big seems to have a pretty long arm, particularly in the negro world. And that includes the railroads. Do you mind?\u0027\n \u0027Of course not,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was going to suggest it. And you couldn\u0027t climb into the top one with your poor hand.\u0027\n Their lunch arrived, brought from the diner by a preoccupied negro waiter. He seemed anxious to be paid and get back to his work.\n When they had finished and Bond rang for the Pullman porter, he also seemed distrait and avoided looking at Bond. He took his time getting the beds made up. He made much show of not having enough room to move around in.\n Finally, he seemed to pluck up courage.\n \u0027Praps Mistress Bryce like set down nex\u0027 door while Ah git the room fixed,\u0027 he said, looking over Bond\u0027s head. \u0027Nex\u0027 room goin\u0027 to be empty all way to St. Pete.\u0027 He took out a key and unlocked the communicating door without waiting for Bond\u0027s reply.\n At a gesture from Bond, Solitaire took the hint. He heard her lock the door into the corridor. The negro bumped the communicating door shut.\n Bond waited for a moment. He remembered the negro\u0027s name.\n \u0027Got something on your mind, Baldwin?\u0027 he asked.\n Relieved, the attendant turned and looked straight at him.\n \u0027Sho\u0027 have, Mister Bryce. Yassuh.\u0027 Once started, the words came in a torrent. \u0027Shouldn be tellin\u0027 yuh this, Mister Bryce, but dere\u0027s plenty trouble \u0027n this train this trip. Yuh gotten yoself a henemy \u0027n dis train, Mister Bryce. Yassuh. Ah hears tings which Ah don\u0027 like at all. Cain\u0027t say much. Get mahself \u0027n plenty trouble. But yuh all want to watch yo step plenty good. Yassuh. Certain party got da finger \u0027n yuh, Mister Bryce, \u0027n dat man is bad news. Better take dese hyah,\u0027 he reached in \u0027his pocket and brought out two wooden window wedges. \u0027Push dem under the doors,\u0027 he said. \u0027Ah cain\u0027t do nuthen else. Git mah throat cut. But Ah don\u0027 like any foolin\u0027 aroun\u0027 wid da customers \u0027n my cyar. Nossuh.\u0027\n Bond took the wedges from him. \u0027But…\u0027\n \u0027Cain\u0027t help yuh no more, Sah,\u0027 said the negro with finality, his hand on the door. \u0027Ef yuh ring fo me dis evenin\u0027, Ah\u0027ll fetch yo dinner. Doan yuh go lettin\u0027 any person else in the room.\u0027\n His hand came out to take the twenty-dollar bill. He crumpled it into his pocket.\n \u0027Ah\u0027ll do all Ah can, Sah,\u0027 he said. \u0027But dey\u0027ll git me ef Ah don\u0027 watch it. Sho will.\u0027 He went out and quickly shut the door behind him.\n Bond thought for a moment then he opened the communicating door. Solitaire was reading.\n \u0027He\u0027s fixed everything,\u0027 he said. \u0027Took a long time about it. Wanted to tell me all his life-story as well. I\u0027ll keep out of your way until you\u0027ve climbed up to your nest. Call me when you\u0027re ready.\u0027\n He sat down next door in the seat she had left and watched the grim suburbs of Philadelphia showing their sores, like beggars, to the rich train.\n No object in frightening her until it had to be. But the new threat had come sooner than he expected, and her danger if the watcher on the train discovered her identity would be as great as his. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/live-and-let-die-james-bond-2/page-13.html","bookId":2425,"book":{"id":2425,"title":"Live and Let Die (James Bond #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Live and Let Die (James Bond (Original Series) #2) \n \"Her hair was black and fell to her shoulders.
