{"id":77609,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"At six twenty-five he went down to the King Cole Bar and chose a table near the entrance and against the wall. A few minutes later Felix Leiter came in. Bond hardly recognized him. His mop of straw-coloured hair was now jet black and he wore a dazzling blue suit with a white shirt and a black-and-white polka-dot tie.\\n\\n Leiter sat down with a broad grin.\\n\\n \u0027I suddenly decided to take these people seriously,\u0027 he explained. \u0027This stuff\u0027s only a rinse. It\u0027ll come off in the morning. I hope,\u0027 he added.\\n\\n Leiter ordered medium-dry Martinis with a slice of lemon peel. He stipulated House of Lords gin and Martini Rossi. The American gin, a much higher proof than English gin, tasted harsh to Bond. He reflected that he would have to be careful what he drank that evening.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll have to keep on our toes, where we\u0027re going,\u0027 said Felix Leiter, echoing his thoughts. \u0027 Harlem \u0027s a bit of a jungle these days. People don\u0027t go up there any more like they used to. Before the war, at the end of an evening, one used to go to Harlem just as one goes to Montmartre in Paris. They were glad to take one\u0027s money. One used to go to the Savoy Ballroom and watch the dancing. Perhaps pick up a high-yaller and risk the doctor\u0027s bills afterwards. Now that\u0027s all changed. Harlem doesn\u0027t like being stared at any more. Most of the places have closed and you go to the others strictly on sufferance. Often you get tossed out on your ear, simply because you\u0027re white. And you don\u0027t get any sympathy from the police either.\u0027\\n\\n Leiter extracted the lemon peel from his Martini and chewed it reflectively. The bar was filling up. It was warm and companionable — a far cry, Leiter reflected, from the inimical, electric climate of the negro pleasure-spots they would be drinking in later.\\n\\n \u0027Fortunately,\u0027 continued Leiter, \u0027I like the negroes and they know it somehow. I used to be a bit of an aficionado of Harlem . Wrote a few pieces on Dixieland Jazz for the Amsterdam News, one of the local papers. Did a series for the North American Newspaper Alliance on the negro theatre about the time Orson Welles put on his Macbeth with an all-negro cast at the Lafayette. So I know my way about up there. And I admire the way they\u0027re getting on in the world, though God knows I can\u0027t see the end of it.\u0027\\n\\n They finished their drinks and Leiter called for the check.\\n\\n \u0027Of course there are some bad ones,\u0027 he said. \u0027Some of the worst anywhere. Harlem \u0027s the capital of the negro world. In any half a million people of any race you\u0027ll get plenty of stinkeroos. The trouble with our friend Mr. Big is that he\u0027s the hell of a good technician, thanks to his oss and Moscow training. And he must be pretty well organized up there.\u0027\\n\\n Leiter paid. He shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s go,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ll have ourselves some fun and try and get back in one piece. After all, this is what we\u0027re paid for. We\u0027ll take a bus on Fifth Avenue. You won\u0027t find many cabs that want to go up there after dark.\u0027\\n\\n They walked out of the warm hotel and took the few steps to the bus stop on the Avenue.\\n\\n It was raining. Bond turned up the collar of his coat and gazed up the Avenue to his right, towards Central Park, towards the dark citadel that housed The Big Man.\\n\\n Bond\u0027s nostrils flared slightly. He longed to get in there after him. He felt strong and compact and confident. The evening awaited him, to be opened and read, page by page, word by word.\\n\\n In front of his eyes, the rain came down in swift, slanting strokes — italic script across the unopened black cover that hid the secret hours that lay ahead.\\n\\n CHAPTER V\\n\\n NIGGER HEAVEN\\n\\n At the bus stop at the corner of Fifth and Cathedral Parkway three negroes stood quietly under the light of a street lamp. They looked wet and bored. They were. They had been watching the traffic on Fifth since the call went out at four-thirty.\\n\\n \u0027Yo next, Fatso,\u0027 said one of them as the bus came up out of the rain and stopped with a sigh from the great vacuum brakes.\\n\\n \u0027Ahm tahd,\u0027 said the thick-set man in the mackintosh. But he pulled his hat down over his eyes and climbed aboard, slotted his coins and moved down the bus, scanning the occupants. He blinked as he saw the two white men, walked on and took the seat directly behind them.\\n\\n He examined the backs of their necks, their coats and hats and their profiles. Bond sat next to the window. The negro saw the reflection of his scar in the dark glass.\\n\\n He got up and moved to the front of the bus without looking back. At the next stop he got off the bus and made straight for the nearest drugstore. He shut himself into the paybox.\\n\\n Whisper questioned him urgently, then broke the connection.\\n\\n He plugged in on the right of the board.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 said the deep voice.\\n\\n \u0027Boss, one of them\u0027s just come in on Fifth. The Limey with the scar. Got a friend with him, but he don\u0027t seem to fit the dope on the other two.\u0027 Whisper passed on an accurate description of Leiter. \u0027Coming north, both of them,\u0027 he gave the number and probable timing of the bus.\\n\\n There was a pause.\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said the quiet voice. \u0027Call off all Eyes on the other avenues. Warn the night spots that one of them\u0027s inside and get this to Tee-Hee Johnson, McThing, Blabbermouth Foley, Sam Miami and The Flannel…\u0027\\n\\n The voice spoke for five minutes.\\n\\n \u0027Got that? Repeat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Sir, Boss,\u0027 said The Whisper. He glanced at his shorthand pad and whispered fluently and without a pause into the mouthpiece.\\n\\n \u0027Right.\u0027 The line went dead.\\n\\n His eyes bright, The Whisper took up a fistful of plugs and started talking to the town.\\n\\n From the moment that Bond and Leiter walked under the canopy of Sugar Ray\u0027s on Seventh Avenue at 12 3rd Street there was a team of men and women watching them or waiting to watch them, speaking softly to The Whisper at the big switchboard on the Riverside Exchange, handing them on towards the rendezvous. In a world where they were naturally the focus of attention, neither Bond nor Leiter felt the hidden machine nor sensed the tension around them.\\n\\n In the famous night-spot the stools against the long bar were crowded, but one of the small booths against the wall was empty and Bond and Leiter slipped into the two seats with the narrow table between them.\\n\\n They ordered Scotch-and-soda - Haig and Haig Pinch-bottle. Bond looked the crowd over. It was nearly all men.\\n\\n There were two or three whites, boxing fans or reporters for the New York sports columns, Bond decided. The atmosphere was warmer, louder than downtown. The walls were covered with boxing photographs, mostly of Sugar Ray Robinson and of scenes from his great fights. It was a cheerful place, doing great business.\\n\\n \u0027He was a wise guy, Sugar Ray,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Let\u0027s hope we both know when to stop when the time comes. He stashed plenty away and now he\u0027s adding to his pile on the music halls. His percentage of this place must be worth a packet and he owns a lot of real estate around here. He works hard still, but it\u0027s not the sort of work that sends you blind or gives you a haemorrhage of the brain. He quit while he was still alive.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027ll probably back a Broadway show and lose it all,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027If I quit now and went in for fruit-farming in Kent, I\u0027d most likely hit the worst weather since the Thames froze over, and be cleaned out. One can\u0027t plan for everything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027One can try,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027But I know what you mean -better the frying-pan you know than the fire you don\u0027t. It isn\u0027t a bad life when it consists of sitting in a comfortable bar drinking good whisky. How do you like this corner of the jungle?\u0027 He leant forward. \u0027Just listen in to the couple behind you. From what I\u0027ve heard they\u0027re straight out of “Nigger Heaven”.\u0027\\n\\n Bond glanced carefully over his shoulder.\\n\\n The booth behind him contained a handsome young negro in an expensive fawn suit with exaggerated shoulders. He was lolling back against the wall with one foot up on the bench beside him. He was paring the nails of his left hand with a small silver pocket-knife, occasionally glancing in bored fashion towards the animation at the bar. His head rested on the back of the booth just behind Bond and a whiff of expensive hair-straightener came from him. Bond took in the artificial parting traced with a razor across the left side of the scalp, through the almost straight hair which was a tribute to his mother\u0027s constant application of the hot comb since childhood. The plain black silk tie and the white shirt were in good taste.\\n\\n Opposite him, leaning forward with concern on her pretty face, was a sexy little negress with a touch of white blood in her. Her jet-black hair, as sleek as the best permanent wave, framed a sweet almond-shaped face with rather slanting eyes under finely drawn eyebrows. The deep purple of her parted, sensual lips was thrilling against the bronze skin. All that Bond could see of her clothes was the bodice of a black satin evening dress, tight and revealing across the firm, small breasts. She wore a plain gold chain round her neck and a plain gold band round each thin wrist.\\n\\n She was pleading anxiously and paid no heed to Bond\u0027s quick embracing glance.\\n\\n \u0027Listen and see if you can get the hang of it,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027It\u0027s straight Harlem — Deep South with a lot of New York thrown in.\u0027\\n\\n Bond picked up the menu and leant back in the booth, studying the Special Fried Chicken Dinner at $3.75.\\n\\n \u0027Cmon, honey,\u0027 wheedled the girl. \u0027How come yuh-all\u0027s actin\u0027 so tahd tonight?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Guess ah jist nacherlly gits tahd listenin\u0027 at yuh,\u0027 said the man languidly. \u0027Why\u0027nt yuh hush yo\u0027 mouff\u0027n let me \u0027joy mahself \u0027n peace \u0027n qui-yet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is yuh wan\u0027 me tuh go \u0027way, honey?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yuh kin suit yo sweet self.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Aw, honey,\u0027 pleaded the girl. \u0027Don\u0027 ack mad at me, honey.

Dat Birdie Johnson, da maitre d\u0027, he permis me a ringside whenebber Ah come nex\u0027.\u0027\\n\\n The man\u0027s voice suddenly sharpened. \u0027Wha\u0027 dat Birdie he mean tuh yuh, hey?\u0027 he asked suspiciously. Terzackly,\u0027 he paused to let the big word sink in, \u0027perzackly wha\u0027 goes\u0027tween yuh \u0027n dat lowdown ornery wuthless Nigguh? Yuh sleepin\u0027 wid him mebbe?

Ah gotta study \u0027bout dat little situayshun.\u0027 He paused threateningly. \u0027Sure have,\u0027 he added.\\n\\n \u0027Aw, honey,\u0027 the girl was anxious. \u0027 \u0027dey ain\u0027t no use tryin\u0027 tuh git mad at me. Ah done nuthen tuh give yuh recasion tuh ack dat way. Ah jist thunk you mebbe preshiate a ringside at da Par\u0027disc \u0027nstead of settin\u0027 hyah countin\u0027 yo troubles.

But Ah mus\u0027 spressify dat yuh stays close up tuh me an keeps yo eyes offn dat lowdown trash \u0027n his hot pants. \u0027N Ah may say,\u0027 he added threateningly,\u0027 dat ef Ah ketches yuh makin\u0027 up tuh dat dope Ah\u0027ll jist nachrally whup da hide off\u0027n yo sweet ass.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shoh ting, honey,\u0027 whispered the girl excitedly.\\n\\n Bond heard the man\u0027s foot scrape off the seat to the ground.\\n\\n \u0027Cmon, baby, lessgo. Waiduh!\u0027\\n\\n Bond put down the menu. \u0027Got the gist of it,\u0027 he said. \u0027Seems they\u0027re interested in much the same things as everyone else - sex, having fun, and keeping up with the Jones\u0027s. Thank God they\u0027re not genteel about it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Some of them are,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Tea-cups, aspidistras and tut-tutting all over the place. The Methodists are almost their strongest sect. Harlem \u0027s riddled with social distinctions, the same as any other big city, but with all the colour variations added. Gome on,\u0027 he suggested, \u0027let\u0027s go and get ourselves something to eat.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/live-and-let-die-james-bond-2/page-6.html","bookId":2425,"book":{"id":2425,"title":"Live and Let Die (James Bond #2)","description":"Storyline: Live and Let Die (James Bond (Original Series) #2) \\n \"Her hair was black and fell to her shoulders.
