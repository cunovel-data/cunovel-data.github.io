Seems the men you got were a pretty nasty trio — Tee-Hee Johnson, Sam Miami and a man called McThing. All wanted on various counts. The F B I\u0027s covering up for you. Reluctantly of course, and the Police are stalling like mad. The FBI big brass had already asked my Chief for you to be sent home — got him out of bed, if you please - mostly jealousy, I guess — but we\u0027ve killed all that. Same time, we\u0027ve both got to quit town at once. That\u0027s all fixed too. We can\u0027t go together, so you\u0027re taking the train and I\u0027ll fly. Jot this down.\u0027 Bond cradled the telephone against his shoulder and reached for a pencil and paper. \u0027Go ahead,\u0027 he said. \u0027Pennsylvania Station. Track 14. Ten-thirty this morning. “The Silver Phantom”. Through train to St. Petersburg via Washington , Jacksonville and Tampa . I\u0027ve got you a compartment. Very luxurious. Car 245, Compartment H. Ticket\u0027ll be on the train. Conductor will have it. In the name of Bryce. Just go to Gate 14 and down to the train. Then straight to your compartment and lock yourself in till the train starts. I\u0027m flying down in an hour by Eastern, so you\u0027ll be alone from now on. If you get stuck call Dexter, but don\u0027t be surprised if he bites your head off. Train gets in around midday tomorrow. Take a cab and go to the Everglades Cabanas, Gulf Boulevard West, on Sunset Beach. That\u0027s on a place called Treasure Island where all the beach hotels are. Connected with St. Petersburg by a causeway. Cabby\u0027ll know it. Til be waiting for you. Got all that? And for God\u0027s sake watch out. And I mean it. The Big Man\u0027ll get you if he possibly can and a police escort to the train would only put the finger on you. Take a cab and keep out of sight. I\u0027m sending you up another hat and a fawn raincoat. The check\u0027s taken care of at the St. Regis. That\u0027s the lot. Any questions?\u0027 \u0027Sounds fine,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027I\u0027ve talked to M and he\u0027ll square Washington if there\u0027s any trouble. Look after yourself too,\u0027 he added. \u0027You\u0027ll be next on the list after me. See you tomorrow. So long.\u0027 Til watch out,\u0027 said Leiter. “Bye.\u0027 It was half-past six and Bond pulled back the curtains in the sitting-room and watched the dawn come up over the city. It was still dark down in the caverns below but the tips of the great concrete stalagmites were pink and the sun lit up the windows floor by floor as if an army of descending janitors was at work in the buildings. The police surgeon came, stayed for a painful quarter of an hour and left. \u0027Clean fracture,\u0027 he had said. \u0027Take a few days to heal. How did you come by it?\u0027 \u0027Caught it in a door,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027You ought to keep away from doors,\u0027 commented the surgeon. \u0027They\u0027re dangerous things. Ought to be forbidden by law. Lucky you didn\u0027t catch your neck in this one.\u0027 When he had gone, Bond finished packing. He was wondering how soon he could order breakfast when the telephone rang. Bond was expecting a harsh voice from the Police or the FBI. Instead, a girl\u0027s voice, low and urgent, asked for Mr. Bond. \u0027Who\u0027s calling?\u0027 asked Bond, gaining time. He knew the answer. \u0027I know it\u0027s you,\u0027 said the voice, and Bond could feel that it was right up against the mouthpiece. \u0027This is Solitaire.\u0027 The name was scarcely breathed into the telephone. Bond waited, all his senses pricked to what might be the scene at the other end of the line. Was she alone? Was she speaking foolishly on a house-phone with extensions to which other listeners were now coldly, intently glued? Or was she in a room with only Mr. Big\u0027s eyes bent carefully on her, a pencil and pad beside him so that he could prompt the next question? \u0027Listen,\u0027 said the voice. I\u0027ve got to be quick. You must trust me. I\u0027m in a drugstore, but I must get back at once to my room. Please believe me.\u0027 Bond had his handkerchief out. He spoke into it. \u0027If I can reach Mr. Bond what shall I tell him?\u0027 \u0027Oh damn you,\u0027 said the girl with what sounded like a genuine touch of hysteria. \u0027I swear by my mother, by my unborn children. I\u0027ve got to get away. And so have you. You\u0027ve got to take me. I\u0027ll help you. I know a lot of his secrets. But be quick. I\u0027m risking my life here talking to you.\u0027 She gave a sob of exasperation and panic. \u0027For God\u0027s sake trust me. You must. You must!\u0027 Bond still paused, his mind working furiously. \u0027Listen,\u0027 she spoke again, but this time dully, almost hopelessly. \u0027If you don\u0027t take me, I shall kill myself. Now will you? Do you want to murder me?\u0027 If it was acting, it was too good acting. It was still an unpardonable gamble, but Bond decided. Fie spoke directly into the telephone, his voice low. \u0027If this is a double-cross, Solitaire, I\u0027ll get at you and kill you if it\u0027s the last thing I do. Have you got a pencil and paper?\u0027 \u0027Wait,\u0027 said the girl, excitedly. \u0027Yes, yes.\u0027 If it had been a plant, reflected Bond, all that would have been ready. \u0027Be at Pennsylvania Station at ten-twenty exactly. The Silver Phantom to…\u0027 he hesitated. \u0027… to Washington . Car 245, Compartment H. Say you\u0027re Mrs. Bryce. Conductor has the ticket in case I\u0027m not there already. Go straight to the compartment and wait for me. Got that?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the girl, \u0027and thank you, thank you.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be seen,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Wear a veil or something.\u0027 \u0027Of course,\u0027 said the girl. \u0027I promise. I really promise. I must go.\u0027 She rang off. Bond looked at the dead receiver, then put it down on the cradle. \u0027Well,\u0027 he said aloud. \u0027That\u0027s torn it.\u0027 He got up and stretched. He walked to the window and looked out, seeing nothing. His thoughts raced. Then he shrugged and turned back to the telephone. He looked at his watch. It was seven-thirty. \u0027Room Service, good morning,\u0027 said the golden voice. \u0027Breakfast, please,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Pineapple juice, double. Cornflakes and cream. Shirred eggs with bacon. Double portion of Cafe Espresso. Toast and marmalade.\u0027 \u0027Yes, Sir,\u0027 said the girl. She repeated the order. \u0027Right away.\u0027 \u0027Thank you.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re welcome.\u0027 Bond grinned to himself. \u0027The condemned man made a hearty breakfast,\u0027 he reflected. He sat down by the window and gazed up at the clear sky, into the future. Up in Harlem , at the big switchboard, The Whisper was talking to the town again, passing Bond\u0027s description again to all Eyes : \u0027All de railroads, all de airports. Fifth Avenue an\u0027 55th Street doors of da San Regis. Mr. Big sez we gotta chance da highways. Pass it down da line. All de railroads, all de airports…\u0027 CHAPTER X THE SILVER PHANTOM BOND, the collar of his new raincoat up round his ears, was missed as he came out of the entrance of the St. Regis Drugstore on 55th Street, which has a connecting door into the hotel. He waited in the entrance and leaped at a cruising cab, hooking the door open with the thumb of his injured hand and throwing his light suitcase in ahead of him. The cab hardly checked. The negro with the collecting-box for the Coloured Veterans of Korea and his colleague fumbling under the bonnet of his stalled car stayed on the job until, much later, they were called off by a man who drove past and sounded two shorts and a long on his horn. But Bond was immediately spotted as he left his cab at the drive-in to the Pennsylvania Station. A lounging negro with a wicker basket walked quickly into a call-box. It was ten-fifteen. Only fifteen minutes to go and yet, just before the train started, one of the waiters in the diner reported sick and was hurriedly replaced by a man who had received a full and careful briefing on the telephone. The chef swore there was something fishy, but the new man said a word or two to him and the chef showed the whites of his eyes and went silent, surreptitiously touching the lucky bean that hung round his neck on a string. Bond had walked quickly through the great glass-covered concourse and through Gate 14 down to his train. It lay, a quarter of a mile of silver carriages, quietly in the dusk of the underground station. Up front, the auxiliary generators of the 4000 horsepower twin Diesel electric units ticked busily. Under the bare electric bulbs the horizontal purple and gold bands, the colours of the Seaboard Railroad, glowed regally on the streamlined locomotives. The engineman and fireman who would take the great train on the first two hundred mile lap into the south lolled in the spotless aluminium cabin, twelve feet above the track, watching the ammeter and the air-pressure dial, ready to go-It was quiet in the great concrete cavern below the city and every noise threw an echo. There were not many passengers. More would be taken on at Newark, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington . Bond walked a hundred yards, his feet ringing on the empty platform, before he found Car 245 towards the rear of the train. A Pullman porter stood at the door. He wore spectacles. His black face was bored but friendly. Below the windows of the carriage, in broad letters of brown and gold, was written \u0027 Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac\u0027, and below that \u0027Bellesylvania\u0027, the name of the Pullman car. A thin wisp of steam rose from the couplings of the central heating near the door. \u0027Compartment H,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Mr. Bryce, Suh? Yassuh. Mrs. Bryce just come aboard. Straight down da cyar.\u0027 Bond stepped on to the train and turned down the drab olive green corridor. The carpet was thick. There was the usual American train-smell of old cigar-smoke. A notice said \u0027Need a second pillow? For any extra comfort ring for your Pullman Attendant. His name is,\u0027 then a printed card, slipped in : \u0027Samuel D. Baldwin.\u0027 H was more than half-way down the car. There was a respectable-looking American couple in E, otherwise the rooms were empty. The door of H was closed. He tried it and it was locked. \u0027Who\u0027s that?\u0027 asked a girl\u0027s voice, anxiously. \u0027It\u0027s me,\u0027 said Bond. The door opened. Bond walked through, put down his bag and locked the door behind him. She was in a black tailor-made. A wide-mesh veil came down from the rim of a small black straw hat. One gloved hand was up to her throat and through the veil Bond could see that her face was pale and her eyes were wide with fear. She looked rather French and very beautiful. \u0027Thank God,\u0027 she said. Bond gave a quick glance round the room. He opened the lavatory door and looked in. It was empty. A voice on the platform outside called \u0027Board!\u0027 There was a clang as the attendant pulled up the folding iron step and shut the door and then the train was rolling quietly down the track. A bell clanged monotonously as they passed the automatic signals. There was a slight clatter from the wheels as they crossed some points and then the train began to accelerate. For better or for worse, they were on their way. \u0027Which seat would you like?\u0027 asked Bond. \u0027I don\u0027t mind,\u0027 she said anxiously. \u0027You choose.\u0027 Bond shrugged and sat down with his back to the engine. He preferred to face forwards. She sat down nervously facing him. They were still in the long tunnel that takes the Philadelphia lines out of the city. She took off her hat and unpinned the broad-mesh veil and put them on the seat beside her. She took some hairpins out of the back of her hair and shook her head so that the heavy black hair fell forward. There were blue shadows under her eyes and Bond reflected that she too must have gone without sleep that night. There was a table between them. Suddenly she reached forward and pulled his right hand towards her on the table. She held it in both her hands and bent forward and kissed it. Bond frowned and tried to pull his hand away, but for a moment she held it tight in both of hers. She looked up and her wide blue eyes looked candidly into his. \u0027Thank you,\u0027 she said. \u0027Thank you for trusting me. It was difficult for you.\u0027 She released his hand and sat back.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/live-and-let-die-james-bond-2/page-12.html","bookId":2425,"book":{"id":2425,"title":"Live and Let Die (James Bond #2)","description":"Storyline: Live and Let Die (James Bond (Original Series) #2) \"Her hair was black and fell to her shoulders.
