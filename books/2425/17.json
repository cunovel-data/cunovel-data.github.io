We owe him a lot.\u0027\\n\\n He finished the story of the rest of their trip.\\n\\n \u0027Anyone spot you when you left the train?\u0027 asked Leiter.\\n\\n \u0027Shouldn\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027But we\u0027d better keep Solitaire under cover until we can get her out. Thought we ought to fly her over to Jamaica tomorrow. I can get her looked after there till we come on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 agreed Leiter. \u0027We\u0027ll put her in a charter plane at Tampa . Get her down to Miami by tomorrow lunch-time and she can take one of the afternoon services - KLM or Panam. Get her in by dinner-time tomorrow. Too late to do anything this afternoon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is that all right, Solitaire?\u0027 Bond asked her.\\n\\n The girl was staring out of the window. Her eyes had the faraway look that Bond had seen before.\\n\\n Suddenly she shivered.\\n\\n Her eyes came back to Bond. She put out a hand and touched his sleeve.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. She hesitated. \u0027Yes, I guess so.\u0027\\n\\n CHAPTER XIII\\n\\n DEATH OF A PELICAN\\n\\n SOLITAIRE Stood up.\\n\\n \u0027I must go and tidy myself,\u0027 she said. \u0027I expect you\u0027ve both got plenty to talk about.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Leiter, jumping up. \u0027Crazy of me! You must be dead beat. Guess you\u0027d better take James\u0027s room and he can bed down with me.”\\n\\n Solitaire followed him out into the little hall and Bond heard Leiter explaining the arrangement of the rooms.\\n\\n In a moment Leiter came back with a bottle of Haig and Haig and some ice.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m forgetting my manners,\u0027 he said. \u0027We could both do with a drink. There\u0027s a small pantry next the bathroom and I\u0027ve stocked it with all we\u0027re likely to need!\u0027\\n\\n He fetched some soda-water and they both took a long drink.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s have the details,\u0027 said Bond, sitting back. \u0027Must have been the hell of a fine job.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure was,\u0027 agreed Leiter, \u0027except for the shortage of corpses.\u0027\\n\\n He put his feet on the table and lit a cigarette.\\n\\n \u0027Phantom left Jacksonville around five,\u0027 he began. \u0027Got to Waldo around six. Just after leaving Waldo - and here I\u0027m guessing - Mr. Big\u0027s man comes along to your car, gets into the next compartment to yours and hangs a towel between the drawn blind and the window, meaning – and he must have done a good deal of telephoning at stations on the way down - meaning “the window to the right of this towel is it”.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a long stretch of straight track between Waldo and Ocala ,\u0027 continued Leiter, \u0027running through forest and swamp land. State highway right alongside the track. About twenty minutes outside Waldo, Wham! goes a dynamite emergency signal under the leading Diesel. Driver comes down to forty. Wham! And another Wham! Three in line! Emergency! Halt at once! He halts the train wondering what the hell. Straight track. Last signal green over green. Nothing in sight. It\u0027s around quarter after six and just getting light. There\u0027s a sedan, clouted heap I expect [Bond raised an eyebrow. \u0027Stolen car,\u0027 explained Leiter], grey, thought to have been a Buick, no lights, engine running, waiting on the highway opposite the centre of the train. Three men get out. Coloured. Probably negro. They walk slowly in line abreast along the grass verge between the road and the track. Two on the outside carry rippers — tommy-guns. Man in the centre has something in his hand. Twenty yards and they stop outside Car 245. Men with the rippers give a double squirt at your window. Open it up for the pineapple. Centre man tosses in the pineapple and all three run back to the car. Two seconds fuse. As they reach the car, BOOM! Fricassee of Compartment H. Fricassee, presumably, of Mr. and Mrs. Bryce. In fact fricassee of your Baldwin who runs out and crouches in corridor directly he sees men approaching his car. No other casualties except multiple shock and hysterics throughout train. Car drives away very fast towards limbo where it still is and will probably remain. Silence, mingled with screams, falls. People run to and fro. Train limps gingerly into Ocala . Drops Car 245. Is allowed to proceed three hours later. Scene II. Leiter sits alone in cottage, hoping he has never said an unkind word to his friend James, and wondering how Mr. Hoover will have Mr. Leiter served for his dinner tonight. That\u0027s all, folks.\u0027\\n\\n Bond laughed. \u0027What an organization!\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m sure it\u0027s all beautifully covered up and alibied. What a man! He certainly seems to have the run of this country. Just shows how one can push a democracy around, what with habeas corpus and human rights and all the rest. Glad we haven\u0027t got him on our hands in England . Wooden truncheons wouldn\u0027t make much of a dent in him. Well,\u0027 he concluded,\u0027 that\u0027s three times I\u0027ve managed to get away with it. The pace is beginning to get a bit hot.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Leiter thoughtfully. \u0027Before you arrived over here you could have counted the mistakes Mr. Big has ever made on one thumb. Now he\u0027s made three all in a row. He won\u0027t like that. We\u0027ve got to put the heat on him while he\u0027s still groggy and then get out, quick. Tell you what I\u0027ve got in mind. There\u0027s no doubt that gold gets into the States through this place. We\u0027ve tracked the Secatur again and again and she just comes straight over from Jamaica to St. Petersburg and docks at that worm-and-bait factory - Rubberus or whatever it\u0027s called.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ourobouros,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027The Great Worm of mythology. Good name for a worm-and-bait factory.\u0027 Suddenly a thought struck him. He hit the glass table-top with the flat of his hand. \u0027Felix! Of course. Ourobouros — “The Robber” — don\u0027t you see? Mr. Big\u0027s man down here. It must be the same.\u0027\\n\\n Leiter\u0027s face lit up. \u0027Christ Almighty,\u0027 he exclaimed.\\n\\n \u0027Of course it\u0027s the same. That Greek who\u0027s supposed to own it, the man in Tarpon Springs that figures in the reports that blockhead showed us in New York , Binswanger. He\u0027s probably just a figurehead. Probably doesn\u0027t even know there\u0027s anything phoney about it. It\u0027s his manager here we\u0027ve got to get after. “The Robber.” Of course that\u0027s who it is.\u0027\\n\\n Leiter jumped up.\\n\\n \u0027G\u0027mon. Let\u0027s get going. We\u0027ll go right along and look the place over. I was going to suggest it anyway, seeing the Secatur always docks at their wharf. She\u0027s in Cuba now, by the way,\u0027 he added, \u0027 Havana . Cleared from here a week ago. They searched her good and proper when she came in and when she left. Didn\u0027t find a thing, of course. Thought she might have a false keel. Almost tore it off. She had to go into dock before she could sail again. Nix. Not a shadow of anything wrong. Let alone a stack of gold coins. Anyway, we\u0027ll go and smell around. See if we can get a look at our Robber friend. I\u0027ll just have to talk to Orlando and Washington. Tell \u0027em all we know. They must catch up quick with The Big Man\u0027s fellow on the train. Probably too late by now. You go and see how Solitaire\u0027s getting on. Tell her she\u0027s not to move till we get back. Lock her in. We\u0027ll take her out to dinner in Tampa . They\u0027ve got the best restaurant on the whole coast, Cuban, “Los Novedades”. We\u0027ll stop at the airport on the way and fix her flight for tomorrow.\u0027\\n\\n Leiter reached for the telephone and asked for Long Distance. Bond left him to it.\\n\\n Ten minutes later they were on their way.\\n\\n Solitaire had not wanted to be left. She had clung to Bond. \u0027I want to get away from here,\u0027 she said, her eyes frightened. \u0027I have a feeling…\u0027 She didn\u0027t end the sentence. Bond kissed her.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027ll be back in an hour or so. Nothing can happen to you here. Then I shan\u0027t leave you until you\u0027re on the plane. We can even stay the night in Tampa and get you off at first light.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, please,\u0027 said Solitaire anxiously. I\u0027d rather do that. I\u0027m frightened here. I feel in danger.\u0027 She put her arms round his neck. \u0027Don\u0027t think I\u0027m being hysterical.\u0027 She kissed him. \u0027Now you can go. I just wanted to see you. Gome back quickly.\u0027\\n\\n Leiter had called and Bond had closed the door on her and locked it.\\n\\n He followed Leiter to his car on the Parkway feeling vaguely troubled. He couldn\u0027t imagine that the girl could come to any harm in this peaceful, law-abiding place, or that The Big Man could conceivably have traced her to The Everglades, which was only one of a hundred similar beach establishments on\\n\\n Treasure Island. But he respected the extraordinary power of her intuitions and her attack of nerves made him uneasy.\\n\\n The sight of Leiter\u0027s car put these thoughts out of his mind.\\n\\n Bond liked fast cars and he liked driving them. Most American cars bored him. They lacked personality and the patina of individual craftsmanship that European cars have. They were just Vehicles\u0027, similar in shape and in colour, and even in the tone of their horns. Designed to serve for a year and then be turned in in part exchange for the next year\u0027s model. All the fun of driving had been taken out of them with the abolition of a gear-change, with hydraulic-assisted steering and spongy suspension. All effort had been smoothed away and all of that close contact with the machine and the road that extracts skill and nerve from the European driver. To Bond, American cars were just beetle-shaped Dodgems in which you motored along with one hand on the wheel, the ladio full on, and the power-operated windows closed to keep out the draughts.\\n\\n But Leiter had got hold of an old Cord, one of the few American cars with a personality, and it cheered Bond to climb into the low-hung saloon, to hear the solid bite of the gears and the masculine tone of the wide exhaust. Fifteen years old, he reflected, yet still one of the most modern-looking cars in the world.\\n\\n They swung on to the causeway and across the wide expanse of unrippled water that separates the twenty miles of narrow island from the broad peninsula sprawling with St. Petersburg and its suburbs.\\n\\n Already as they idled up Central Avenue on their way across the town to the Yacht Basin and the main harbour and the big hotels, Bond caught a whiff of the atmosphere that makes the town the \u0027Old Folks Home\u0027 of America . Everyone on the sidewalks had white hair, white or blue, and the famous Sidewalk Davenports that Solitaire had described were thick with oldsters sitting in rows like the starlings in\\n\\n Trafalgar Square. Bond noted the small grudging mouths of the women, the sun gleaming on their pince-nez; the stringy, collapsed chests and arms of the men displayed to the sunshine in Truman shirts. The fluffy, sparse balls of hair on the women showing the pink scalp. The bony bald heads of the men. And, everywhere, a prattling camaraderie, a swapping of news and gossip, a making of folksy dates for the shuffle board and the bridge-table, a handing round of letters from children and grandchildren, a tut-tutting about prices in the shops and the motels.\\n\\n You didn\u0027t have to be amongst them to hear it all. It was all in the nodding and twittering of the balls of blue fluff, the back-slapping and hawk-an-spitting of the little old baldheads.\\n\\n \u0027It makes you want to climb right into the tomb and pull the lid down,\u0027 said Leiter at Bond\u0027s exclamations of horror. \u0027You wait till we get out and walk. If they see your shadow coming up the sidewalk behind them they jump out of the way as if you were the Chief Cashier coming to look over their shoulders in the bank. It\u0027s ghastly. Makes me think of the bank clerk who went home unexpectedly at midday and found the President of the bank sleeping with his wife. He went back and told his pals in the ledger department and said, “Gosh, fellers, he nearly caught me!” \u0027\\n\\n Bond laughed.\\n\\n \u0027You can hear all the presentation gold watches ticking in their pockets,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027Place is full of undertakers, and pawnshops stuffed with gold watches and masonic rings and bits of jet and lockets full of hair. Makes you shiver to think of it all. Wait till you go to “Aunt Milly\u0027s Place” and see them all in droves mumbling over their corn-beef hash and cheeseburgers, trying to keep alive till ninety. It\u0027ll frighten the life out of you. But they\u0027re not all old down here. Take a look at that ad over there.\u0027 He pointed towards a big hoarding on a deserted lot. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/live-and-let-die-james-bond-2/page-17.html","bookId":2425,"book":{"id":2425,"title":"Live and Let Die (James Bond #2)","description":"Storyline: Live and Let Die (James Bond (Original Series) #2) \\n \"Her hair was black and fell to her shoulders.
