Some place with other elephants. He’ll want to live among his own kind.” Beaming, Beatrix led the elephant out of the granary. “But in the meantime . . . won’t the neighbors love it when I take Ollie out for a walk?”\\n\\n Dressed in a white nightgown, her fair hair loose and flowing, Win entered the bedroom to find Kev waiting for her.\\n\\n Their first night as husband and wife.\\n\\n And although Kev, in all his dark handsomeness, was beloved and familiar to her, she felt a pleasant ripple of nervousness.\\n\\n He stripped off his shirt, revealing a sleek, powerful torso, and tossed it aside.\\n\\n His gaze smoldered as it passed over her slowly.
