{"id":38303,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. THE END.","content":"Frank was amazed at the cool nerve and effrontery of the wretch. For a moment the young inventor was silent. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he said: \\n\\n \\n\\n “You have one of our men in captivity here. I want him.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The chief shook his head sullenly. \\n\\n \\n\\n “What?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Mebbe no.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Mebbe, yes!” cried Frank, angrily. “Come, I’ll blow you to perdition if you don’t give him up!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No can do dat.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Why?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “White man killed!” \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment Frank reeled as if given a terrific blow. He turned ghastly pale. Then Gaston was dead. \\n\\n \\n\\n “That is awful!” he thought. \\n\\n \\n\\n But something in the Esquimau chief’s face caused him to start. He grasped the situation at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You are lying!” he hissed, leaning over the rail. “Give him up, or I’ll kill you and all your cowardly crew!” \\n\\n \\n\\n The Esquimau chief laughed scornfully, and gave a peculiar cry. In a moment the vicinity was thronged with armed natives. \\n\\n \\n\\n Frank saw that the crisis had come. There was no use in dallying further. \\n\\n \\n\\n He picked up a bomb brought him by Barney and hurled it fairly into the midst of the murderous horde. \\n\\n \\n\\n In a flash there was a frightful explosion. Heaps of dead and dying Esquimaux lay upon the ground. \\n\\n \\n\\n The survivors fled wildly. Frank leaped from the airship’s deck. He rushed into the nearest bough hut. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was Gaston bound hand and foot. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Thank God! you have come to save me!” cried the scientist. “You are none too soon!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “But there is yet danger!” cried Frank. “Follow me quickly!” \\n\\n \\n\\n To the airship they rushed. The Esquimaux were recovering and seemed ready to fight. But though he could have annihilated the whole gang, Frank did not wait for their attack. \\n\\n \\n\\n Up into the air sprang the airship. \\n\\n \\n\\n The course was at once set to the southward and for a week was firmly held. Then evidences of civilization appeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n Canada was passed over, Lake Erie and then the United States was once more beneath the aerial voyagers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Home again! There was an indescribable charm in the words. \\n\\n \\n\\n The airship descended into Readestown one evening. The next morning every daily paper in the world was recording the return of the travelers from zone to zone. \\n\\n \\n\\n James Spencer returned to his home where he was happily welcomed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Professor Gaston took the first train to New York and reported to the committee of the scientific society. \\n\\n \\n\\n The much-mooted question of the two Poles was settled forever. Professor Gaston was instantly made honorary member in every scientific society in the world. \\n\\n \\n\\n Indeed, the honors thrust upon him were most burdensome. \\n\\n \\n\\n Barney and Pomp were pleased to once more return to their duties in quiet old Readestown. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I don’ fink I want berry much to do wif dem Arctic countries!” Pomp declared. “Dey am a pooty po’ place fo’ a live man.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Bejabers, I’m wid yez, naygur!” cried Barney. “Hurroo fer ould Oireland an’ Afriky!” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And hurrah for America, the queen of all nations!” cried Frank Reade, Jr., with a laugh, for he had overheard them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Dart was at once taken to pieces. The strain of her long voyage would preclude any possibility of ever using her again. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the young inventor had plenty of other plans to develop. \\n\\n \\n\\n For many a day the famous trip of Frank Reade, Jr., and his airship, the Dart, from zone to zone, rang through the country. \\n\\n \\n\\n But though this was certainly a most extraordinary feat, the young inventor had even mightier projects on hand, some of which the reader may hear of at a later day. \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1927/55366.html","bookId":881,"book":{"id":881,"title":"From Zone to Zone","description":"简介： A very important meeting of the American Scientific Society had been held in their Hall in the city of New York.All the learned savants and geographers of the day were present, for the subject to be discussed was one of great interest.For centuries c...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1927","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:47 AM"}}
