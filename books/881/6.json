IN THE MIDST OF A STORM.","content":"Pomp’s head took Barney full in the stomach. \n \n The Celt was propelled across the cabin floor like a stone out of a catapult, and landed with a terrific crash clear under his own bunk. For a moment he was stunned and utterly unable to tell where he was or what had happened. \n \n Pomp did not follow up his victory. \n \n His anger was gone in a moment. \n \n He simply stood still and laughed until the tears ran down his black cheeks and his sides heaved like bellows. \n \n Then he went back into his galley and to his bread making. \n \n Slowly and soberly Barney picked himself up. He said nothing, but went slowly and sadly away. \n \n It seemed a code of honor between the two that hostilities were to cease the very moment one or the other came off victorious. \n \n In this case Pomp was the winner. \n \n But it was not always so. Very often Barney was best man. Indeed, honors were evenly divided. \n \n The airship now took its southward course. \n \n The first move was to accurately locate the South Pole, explore some of the frozen regions, take general observations, and then set a northward course for the frigid zone of the Arctic. \n \n Thus far Professor Gaston was delighted with the result of the trip. \n \n “Even if we never reach the other pole,” he declared, “we have accomplished enough now to place our names high upon the scroll of fame.” \n \n But Frank said: \n \n “Have no fear, professor. We are going to reach the Arctic and make what is really a circumnavigation of the globe.” \n \n “And all the way in the air!” cried the professor. “Most wonderful of experiences is this!” \n \n Vast areas of frozen country were passed over. Days of sailing above this desolate waste followed. \n \n And every day Professor Gaston took a new observation. Every day he declared that they were growing nearer the Pole. \n \n “I have a great curiosity,” he declared. “You know it is a commonly accepted belief that the region about the South Pole is very open and warm. That in fact ice does not exist there at all!” \n \n “I believe that is true,” declared Frank. “The most extensive volcanic region in the world, I believe, lies adjacent to the South Pole.” \n \n “We shall see.” \n \n One morning, or rather just as the explorers had risen, for it was the latter part of the Antarctic night of six long months, Barney spied a strange scene ahead. \n \n Mighty mountain ranges showed, rising to fearful heights, and all were devoid of ice or snow. \n \n Indeed, several of them appeared to be active volcanoes. \n \n At once the Celt gave the alarm. \n \n Everybody piled on deck, and Professor Gaston seemed the most excited of any. \n \n “Hurrah!” he cried. “At last we have reached the South Pole. In place of an open sea as in the Arctic, we have mighty volcanic mountains.” \n \n The Dart rapidly neared the mountain range. And as it did so, beyond them was revealed a wonderful sight. \n \n As far as the eye could reach all was a fertile valley of green. Indeed, small lakes dotted this region, and there were rivers and forests. \n \n “The Polar country!” cried Gaston, with excitement. “Surely it is a wonderful discovery. Is it inhabited?” \n \n The airship slowly sailed over the mountain peaks. Suddenly Gaston pointed to a tall one and declared. \n \n “That is the South Pole, or at least it is exactly upon the spot where the pole should be!” \n \n Over the Antarctic country the airship drifted. \n \n There was a most remarkable change in the atmosphere. In place of the stinging cold there was a soft mildness which bore a strange resemblance to furnace heat. \n \n Hundreds of miles in area was the fertile country of the South Pole. \n \n Various animals were seen, but in all the three hundred miles of sailing across the fertile and warm area our voyagers saw nothing of human beings. \n \n However, Gaston declared: \n \n “It is but a small part we have explored as yet. They may exist in some other section. Our sole object now is to locate the two poles. Some other time we may be able to more extensively explore each. Eh, Mr. Reade?” \n \n “That is agreeable to me,” replied Frank. “Indeed, we have not come prepared for a very long sojourn in this region.” \n \n So the Dart crossed the Polar region as quickly as possible. \n \n Straight across the region they went, until once more the circular range of mountains was crossed, and the region of ice and snow again was spread to view. \n \n “We have crossed the South Pole,” declared Frank Reade, Jr., “and we have started northward for home. Now, we may proceed with more of leisure. I am anxious to take a look at some of the countries we pass over, notably Africa.” \n \n “I am more than agreeable,” declared Professor Gaston. “In fact, it is your pleasure, Mr. Reade.” \n \n Straight to the northward the course was now held. \n \n No incident worthy of record occurred. The same unvarying monotony of ice and snow continued for many days. \n \n Then there came a noticeable change in the atmosphere. The sun became visible above the horizon. \n \n And as the airship sped on the ice and snow began to disappear and the open sea came into view. \n \n Still northward the airship sped, until Kerguelen Land was sighted. Due north was Australia. \n \n Not having any desire to go thither, Frank changed the course of the airship to the northwest. \n \n This brought them over tempestuous seas, and in these latitudes the airship encountered a terrific storm. \n \n It was the means of nigh causing the wreck of the Dart. \n \n The voyagers were all in the cabin at dinner. \n \n The wheel had been lashed and the Dart was traveling at a fair rate of speed. \n \n Suddenly something like an explosion brought every man to his feet. \n \n The next moment they were hurled about the cabin like puppets. \n \n “My God!” cried Professor Gaston, in mortal terror. “The airship is falling!” \n \n “Steady!” shouted Frank. “We must reach the wheel!” \n \n But all was utter darkness. It seemed as if ten thousand fiends had the Dart in hand and was tossing it about like a puppet. \n \n Caught in the arms of the storm, the airship was whirled aloft to dizzy heights, and no doubt would have been torn to pieces had it not been for a favorable accident. \n \n Frank Reade, Jr., had been hurled to the floor of the cabin and was unable for a moment to stand on his feet. \n \n None of the others could reach the pilot-house. \n \n Indeed, it was lucky that none of them reached the deck. \n \n They could not have remained there a moment. \n \n The horror of the situation can easily be imagined when it is remembered that all was utter darkness and the voyagers were groping about the cabin in the most fearful of uncertainty. \n \n “My God!” gasped Frank, in utter horror, “we are lost!” \n \n There was no expectation but that the rigging would be wrecked and they would be dashed into the sea. \n \n A fearful death by drowning would be certain in that event. \n \n But a lucky accident saved the airship and the lives of all on board. \n \n The fearful shock of the wind had caused the rotascope lever to fly open. In a moment the full current was on. \n \n The rotascope revolved for all it was worth. This steadied the airship and caused it to shoot upward with fearful rapidity. \n \n This saved the day. Up, whirling higher and higher went the Dart. Suddenly the wind ceased, sunlight was all about, and the airship rode in quiet air. \n \n But she was shooting upward with frightful velocity. \n \n Frank sprang out on the deck. He saw how things were, at once. \n \n Far below thundered and bellowed the black clouds of the storm. The airship had risen above it. \n \n The joy of the aerial voyagers knew no bounds. \n \n First, though, Frank made a careful examination of every part of the ship. To his amazement not a thing was broken. \n \n “All safe and sound!” he cried, joyfully. “I tell you it was a narrow escape!” \n \n “Luck is with us!” declared Professor Gaston. \n \n As soon as possible Frank checked the flying rotascope. \n \n If he had not done so the airship would soon have reached an altitude where it would be painful to breathe. \n \n As soon as the storm had passed the Dart was once more allowed to descend. \n \n No other incident worthy of note occurred until one morning Barney from the pilot-house shouted: \n \n “Land ho!” \n \n At once Frank and the professor were on deck with powerful glasses. A few moments of study revealed the character of the distant land. \n \n It was the southern coast of Africa, and soon the settlement of Cape Town could be seen. \n \n White-sailed ships were in the bay, and as they passed a few thousand feet above the town it could be seen that there was much excitement below. \n \n The people were out in force, and were shouting and waving banners. But Frank Reade, Jr., had no intention of making a stop. \n \n “Not this time!” he declared. “I have other matters on hand. Besides, it would be hardly safe to land there.” \n \n “Safe!” ejaculated Gaston, in amazement. “Why not?” \n \n “Easy enough. A vast concourse of people like that are apt to lose their heads and do the airship much damage.” \n \n “That could not be among civilized people!” \n \n “They are the most to be feared as they cannot keep their hands off knowing well the nature of the machine. Superstitious fear keeps the savage at a safe distance.” \n \n “Upon my word I believe you are right!” cried the professor. “Though it never occurred to me that way before.” \n \n So the airship did not stop at Cape Town. Keeping on rapidly it passed over a populous and fertile tract of country. \n \n For several days the Dart kept on its rapid northward flight. \n \n The country had changed. \n \n Vast wilds extended as far as the eye could reach, populated with savages and wild tribes. \n \n Wild beasts could be seen in great numbers from the airship’s deck. \n \n Barney and Pomp were spoiling for an African hunt, so Frank decided to gratify their desire and make a brief stop. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1927/55359.html","bookId":881,"book":{"id":881,"title":"From Zone to Zone","description":"简介： A very important meeting of the American Scientific Society had been held in their Hall in the city of New York.All the learned savants and geographers of the day were present, for the subject to be discussed was one of great interest.For centuries c...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1927","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:47 AM"}}
