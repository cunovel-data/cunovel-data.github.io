Now, as Eldin skewered the last of the gaunts through its neck, sending its lifeless body spinning into die awesome chasm, the demon-god reached out from beneath his billowing cloak three green and black things which might have been arms, each terminating in seven slimy worms which were perhaps fingers.\\n\\n Hero immediately slashed at one of these loathsome appendages with his curved blade of Kled, but his weapon simply bounced off. The monster\u0027s flesh was completely impervious to weapons of Earth\u0027s dreamland. The seven long \"fingers\" of that uninjured \"hand\" wrapped around Hero\u0027s head, forcing him to his knees, while the other two arms reached for Eldin.\\n\\n Utterly exhausted, the older dreamer miraculously avoided Yibb-Tstll\u0027s slimy grasp and went down on his knees beside his companion. As he did so his fingers touched the kerchief-wrapped gem where it hung from Hero\u0027s belt. He tore at the bundle, crying: \"It\u0027s your eye, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027ve come for your damned eye!\" And as Hero fought to tear loose the vile fingers which groped to get into his eyes, his mouth, nostrils and ears, so Eldin ripped open the snow-wet bundle and clutched its contents to his heaving chest-for a moment only!\\n\\n For the gem was a gem no longer, nor was it green and hard. It was wet and soft as jelly, and it was red! It was an eye-a living eye-the twin of me loathsome orb that vacillated even now over Yibb-Tstll\u0027s hideous face!\\n\\n Instinctively, or as if inspired, Eldin squeezed the thing in his massive hands, and instantly the demon-god snatched back his three writhing pseudopods. For a moment Yibb-Tstll seemed to throb and expand-in rage, perhaps, or pain-but then his cloak flew wide and allowed the stunned dreamers to peer within ... at a writhing mass of sucking mouths, lashing pseudopods and heaving black breasts! Right up to the two flowed the horror from the stars, and in another moment his cloak had started to close about them. Then-\\n\\n \"Take your damned eye! \" yelled Eldin, and with his last ounce of strength he hurled the softly plastic thing into the horror\u0027s face. With a sickening squelching sound the eye flew into and filled the empty socket. In that same instant the demon-god shuddered to a halt. All motion went out of the huge figure; the cloak\u0027s eery undulations ceased; the vastly lumbering being turned stony gray and its prodigal eye flashed green once more!\\n\\n Whatever Yibb-Tstll\u0027s living weight, it in no way compared to his weight as a stone thing. The ridge shuddered as a jagged, zig-zagging crack appeared in the thick crust of snow directly beneath Eldin where he crouched. As the gap widened he lost his balance and tumbled into it, falling face down on solid rock. Then there came the roar of avalanching boulders and snow and Eldin saw the ridge swept clean as the petrified god began to somersault backward down the steep slope, flying into fragments as he went.\\n\\n In less than a minute all was still except for the wracking coughs that shattered an almost unnatural silence. Eldin, when he had himself under control, turned his face from the scene of devastation down on the plateau of the keep, staring into the disk of the rising sun. \"David,\" he croaked, scanning the empty ridge. Then he blinked his eyes against the dazzle of sunlight and stared harder, unable to comprehend that indeed the summit was naked, a ridge of scarred and empty rock.\\n\\n \"David!\" Eldin roared, hearing his mighty shout of horror and despair echoing away and down into unknown inner vaults. For a moment there was utter silence, then-\\n\\n \"Never mind the shouting, old lad!\" came his friend\u0027s hoarse cry from beyond the rim of the ridge. \"Just get on down to the caves and fetch a rope-and be quick about it!\"\\n\\n Eldin laughed wildly at that and crawled to the lip of the chasm. Fifty feet below, sprawled in the branches of a cleft-grown shrub green with spring\u0027s buds, David Hero looked up with white face and wide eyes. Below him the face of the cliff seemed to go down forever, was lost in cloud at an indeterminate depth.\\n\\n \"Hang on, lad,\" Eldin cried. \"I\u0027ll be back, never fear. And David-\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t go away!\"\\n\\n In fact it was Aminza climbed the ridge to haul Hero to safety. She had met Eldin as he staggered on useless legs toward the cave, had helped him into the warm tunnel, covered him with furs, poured wine down him until he could talk coherently. Then she had found a rope and gone to look for Hero.\\n\\n Since then a month had gone by and with it the very last traces of snow from the heights. Since then, too, Hero and Aminza had searched diligently among the fragments of stalagmitic rock at the foot of the final rise, discovering nothing of Yibb-Tstll\u0027s emerald eye. Which was probably just as well.\\n\\n Now the three of them stood together at the foot of the great keep, weighed down with necessaries, fit and rested and ready to move on-even Eldin, ruddy with health, whose painful coughing had not been heard for well over a week.\\n\\n \"I still don\u0027t understand it,\" the older dreamer grumbled. \"There was I, fit to die-and here I am now, strong as a horse!\"\\n\\n \u0027Thinistor\u0027s medicine,\" Aminza answered with a laugh. \"If I\u0027ve told you once, I\u0027ve told you a dozen times. When the great gaunt first brought me here, I, too, was near to death. It was a result of all that flying in the cold night air. Thinistor gave me the same elixir I gave to you-with the same result. We were both made well! So you see, some good came out of that old devil Thinistor after all.\"\\n\\n \"Indeed it did,\" Eldin growled, giving the girl a hug that near cracked her ribs. He turned to the younger man, strangely silent as he stared up the massive wall of the keep. \"What\u0027s on your mind, David?\"\\n\\n \"Uh? Oh, I was just wondering ...\"\\n\\n \"About what? The keep?\" Eldin frowned and took the other\u0027s arm. \"Now just a minute, lad-\"\\n\\n But Hero shook himself free and turned to his companions with blazing, excited eyes. \"Why not?\" he demanded. \"Thinistor found a way in, didn\u0027t he? Why shouldn\u0027t we? Who\u0027s to say what we\u0027d find in there?\"\\n\\n Eldin looked at the girl and shrugged. \"You did say that the wizard had a lot of money hidden away somewhere, Aminza. Well, perhaps he kept it in the keep.\"\\n\\n \"So,\" she answered fatalistically. \"Where do we go from here?\"\\n\\n Her companions looked at each other and grinned.\\n\\n \"We have a way of making decisions at times like this,\" said Hero, taking out a golden tond. He handed the coin to Eldin. \"Are you with us, girl?\"\\n\\n \"Do I have a choice?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll do as you wish, Aminza,\" Eldin immediately answered. \"We owe you that much at least.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but you\u0027d never forgive me,\" she returned. \"So- let\u0027s do it! Let it all rest on the toss of a coin.\"\\n\\n For a long moment the three stared into each others\u0027 eyes. \"We do have a little unfinished business with a certain Ossaran,\" Hero murmured.\\n\\n \"Aye,\" Eldin agreed, \"but it\u0027s not as if we\u0027ll be here forever. Two or three days at most...\" They looked up at the looming keep, and as the sun passed behind it so its shadow began to fall upon them.\\n\\n \"Heads we stay,\" said Hero, breaking the silence.\\n\\n \"And tails-\" Eldin began.\\n\\n \"-Means Theelys,\" Aminza finished, \"and a ship bound for Ilek-Vad for me.\"\\n\\n Hero took a deep breath and flipped die coin high, and the triangular tond glinted as it flashed out of shadow and into sunlight, before falling to the earth at their feet ... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hero-of-dreams-new-adventures-in-h-p-lovecraft-s-dreamlands-1/page-10.html","bookId":2599,"book":{"id":2599,"title":"Hero of Dreams ( New Adventures in H.P.
