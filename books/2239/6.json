Events and preparations made the time blur. Only a few things stood out clearly when I thought about it later.\n The night we were riding home from the barbecue Amina\u0027s parents held for us, out at their lake house, Martin finally told me where we were going on our honeymoon. He had asked what I wanted, and I had told him to surprise me. I had half-expected the Caymans, or perhaps a Caribbean cruise. \"I wanted you to have a choice, so I\u0027ve made initial preparations for two things,\" he began, as the Mercedes purred down the dreadful blacktop that led to the state highway back into town. I leaned back against the seat, full of anticipation and barbecued pork.\n \"We can either go to Washington for two weeks, and do the Smithsonian right.\"\n I breathed out a sigh of delight.\n \"Or we can go to England.\"\n I was stunned. \"Oh, Martin. But is there really something - I mean, both of those are things you would enjoy too?\"\n \"Sure. I\u0027ve been to the Washington area many times, but I\u0027ve never had time to see the Smithsonian. And if you pick England, we can go on a walking tour of famous murder sites in London, if you\u0027ll come with me to get some suits made on Savile Row, or as close to Savile Row as I can man-age.\" \"How can I pick?\" I chewed on my bottom lip in happy agony. \"Oh... England! I just can\u0027t wait! Martin, what a great idea!\"\n He was smiling one of his rare broad smiles. \"I picked the right things, then.\" \"Yes! I thought for sure we\u0027d be going to some island to lie on gritty sand and get all salty!\"\n He laughed out loud. \"Maybe we can do that sometime, too. But I wanted you to have a really good time, and a beach honeymoon just didn\u0027t sound like you.\" Once again, Martin had surprised me with his perception. If we\u0027d sat down and consulted on it, I would never have thought of suggesting England (going farther than the Caribbean had never crossed my mind), and if I had, I would have dismissed the idea as something that wouldn\u0027t have appealed to Martin. We had an absolutely wonderful time after we got to the townhouse.\n Another moment I remembered afterward was Amina\u0027s introduction to Martin. I was very excited about her meeting him and attributed her unusual silence thereafter to the bouts of nausea she was still experiencing. Amina, who had always been happily unconscious of her good health, was having a hard time adjusting to the new limits and discomforts her pregnancy was imposing on her. Her hair was hanging limply instead of bouncing and glowing, her skin was spotty, her ankles were swelling if she sat still for more than a short time, and she seemed to alternate nausea with heartburn. But every time she thought about the baby actually arriving, she was happy as a clam at high tide. So at first I thought it was just feeling demoralized about her appearance that made Amina uncharacteristically silent. Finally, unwisely, I asked her directly what she thought about Martin.\n \"I know I\u0027m not my normal self right now, but I\u0027m not crazy, either,\" Amina began. I got that ominous feeling, the one you get when you know you\u0027re about to get very angry and it\u0027s your own fault. We were standing out in the front yard of the Julius house, which was beginning to look as my imagination had pictured it when I had first seen it. John Henry\u0027s legs, in their plumbers\u0027 overalls, were protruding from the crawl space under the house, a young black man was trimming the foundation bushes, and the Youngbloods were doing a strange Asian thing on the broad driveway in front of the garage. It was some kind of martial ballet alternating sudden kicks and screams with hissing breathing and slow graceful movements. Amina watched them for a moment and shook her head in disbelief. \"Honey,\" she said, looking directly into my eyes, \"who are those people?\"\n \"I told you, Amina,\" I said, \"Shelby is an old army buddy of Martin\u0027s, and he\n lost his job in Florida - \"\n \"Cut the crap.\"\n I gaped at my best friend.\n \"What job? Where, exactly? Doing what? And what does she do? Does she look like Hannah Housewife to you?\"\n \"Well, maybe they\u0027re not exactly like the people we know...\" \"Damn straight! Hugh said they looked more like people the criminal-law side of his firm would defend!\"\n Bringing in Hugh, her husband, was a mistake, Amina realized instantly. \"Okay, okay,\" she said, holding up her hands, \"truce. But listen, honey, those people seem very strange to me. Martin wanting them to live out here with you all - I don\u0027t know, it just looks . .. funny.\"\n \"Be a little more specific, Amina,\" I said very stiffly. \"Funny? How?\" Amina shifted from foot to uncomfortable foot. \"Could we sit down?\" she asked plaintively. I recognized a delaying tactic, but she really was tired. I pushed a folding lawn chair in her direction. I pulled over one for myself. Martin and I had been sitting out on the lawn the evening before, looking at the house and talking about our plans.\n \"I shouldn\u0027t have started this,\" Amina muttered to herself and tried to arrange her altering body in the light aluminum-frame chair. \"I\u0027m just worried about you,\" she said directly. \"If Martin was a regular guy in a regular job who came home every night, I\u0027d like him fine. And I do like him as he is, because he obviously thinks you\u0027re the greatest thing since sliced bread. But he\u0027s gone so much, he works so hard, such long hours. Why does he have to be out of town so much? Plant managers are supposed to stay at the plant, right? And these Youngbloods.\" She shook her head.\n \"Amina, stop.\"\n \"Your mom\u0027s worried, too.\" She was crying.\n The Youngbloods had finished their strange ritual and were doing some kind of exercise in which they faced each other, squatted, and whacked each other\u0027s arms.\n My mother, I reflected, had been smart enough not to say anything.\n To tell the truth, this conversation shook me.\n I handed Amina a Kleenex from my shoulder bag.\n \"I\u0027m just scared that - it almost looks like you\u0027ll be their prisoner.\"\n \"Amina, I think you need to go lie down,\" I said, after a little silence.\n \"Don\u0027t patronize me! I may be pregnant but I\u0027m not stupid.\"\n \"Then you\u0027ll believe me when I say that I don\u0027t want to hear any more of this.\" We each stared off angrily in opposite directions, composing ourselves, trying to be friends again.\n It took a few days.\n The ceremony itself was brief and beautiful. Lawrencetonians filled up my side of the church and half the rows on Martin\u0027s. Being older, and having moved so many times, Martin had not invited many people, and those who came were business associates from Pan-Am Agra, a few old friends from Ohio, and his sister Barbara. I had some sympathy for Barby since I\u0027d learned more of her history while I was in Corinth, but still I knew she would never become my favorite person or my confidante. (She brought her daughter, a sophomore at Kent State, a pretty, dark, plump, young woman named Regina. Regina was not blessed with many brains and asked far too often why her cousin Barrett hadn\u0027t come to see his dad get married.)\n So St. James Episcopal Church was full, Emily Kaye played the organ beautifully, my mother walked down the aisle with the dignity that was her trademark, Martin appeared from Aubrey\u0027s study with John at his side - Martin looked absolutely delicious in his tux - and Amina went down the aisle in her full-skirted dress that fairly well concealed her pregnancy. Then it was my turn. My father and his wife had finally decided to come, pretty much at the last minute; you can imagine how their lack of enthusiasm made me feel. And then they\u0027d left my brother Phillip with some friends in California. My crushing disappointment had permanently altered the way I felt about my father.\n I am no apple-cart upsetter. I am no flouter of tradition. And I am not a person who likes last-minute changes in plans. But when my father had arrived, I had told him I wanted to walk down the aisle by myself. My mother drew in a sharp breath, opened her mouth to say something, then looked at me and shut it. And I didn\u0027t explain my decision to Father, or wait for his reaction, or tell him not to get his feelings hurt. And Betty Jo had no say at all. So Father and Betty Jo had walked in before Mother.\n That\u0027s why I came down the aisle by myself when Emily began playing the music I\u0027d waited so many years to hear. I\u0027d had my hair put up, I was wearing the earrings Martin had given me the night before we\u0027d gotten engaged, I was wearing full bride regalia. I felt like the Homecoming Queen, Miss America, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and a Tony Award nominee, all rolled into one. And we got married. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-julius-house-aurora-teagarden-4/page-6.html","bookId":2239,"book":{"id":2239,"title":"The Julius House (Aurora Teagarden #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Julius House (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #4) \n Since she met her fiance Martin Bartell, Roe Teagarden has never been happier.
