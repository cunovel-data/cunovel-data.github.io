I kept telling myself none of it could be true. It made things a lot easier to handle.\\n\\n Back at Amberwood, I found the usual buzz of evening student activity. It felt comforting after my shocking outing, far removed from fanatics and cryptic spells. My phone buzzed with a text message the minute I stepped into my dorm room. It was from Jill: Come see us when you\u0027re back. I sighed. No rest for the wicked, it would seem. I left my purse in my room and then trudged down to the second floor, unsure of what I\u0027d find.\\n\\n Jill opened her door, looking immensely relieved to see me. \"Thank God. We have a situation.\"\\n\\n \"We always have a situation,\" I said. I stepped inside and saw Angeline sitting on the floor, back against the wall and a miserable expression on her face. \"What happened?\"\\n\\n She looked up quickly. \"It wasn\u0027t my fault.\"\\n\\n The sinking feeling in my stomach increased. \"It never is, is it? I repeat: what happened?\"\\n\\n When Angeline refused to say, Jill spoke up. \"She gave Trey a concussion with an algebra book.\"\\n\\n Before I could even start to parse that, Angeline leapt to her feet. \"The doctor said it wasn\u0027t a concussion!\"\\n\\n \"Wait.\" I glanced between them, half hoping they\u0027d burst into laughter at the joke they must be playing on me. \"You did something to Trey that actually required medical attention?\"\\n\\n \"I barely touched him,\" she insisted.\\n\\n I sat down on Jill\u0027s bed and resisted the urge to crawl under its covers. \"No. You can\u0027t do this. Not again. What did the principal say? Oh, God. Where are we going to send you?\" After Angeline\u0027s brawl with a motivational group, it had been made very clear that further fighting would get her expelled.\\n\\n \"Eddie took the blame,\" said Jill. A small smile crossed her face as she spoke. \"There weren\u0027t really many witnesses, so Eddie said they were playing around in the library and tossing the book back and forth. He claimed he got careless and threw the book too hard . . . and that it accidentally hit Trey on the head.\"\\n\\n Angeline nodded. \"That\u0027s kind of what really happened with us.\"\\n\\n \"No, it wasn\u0027t,\" protested Jill. \"I saw it. You got mad when Trey told you it shouldn\u0027t be that hard to understand that x always has a different value.\"\\n\\n \"He implied that I was stupid!\"\\n\\n Variables didn\u0027t seem like too hard a concept to me, but I could tell under Angeline\u0027s bravado that she really was flustered. I always had the impression that back among the Keepers, Angeline had been a queen among her peers. Here she was constantly trying to keep up academically and socially adrift in a world very different from the one she\u0027d grown up in. That would make anyone insecure. And while I questioned if Trey had ever said she was stupid, I could understand how some of his snarky commentary could be perceived that way.\\n\\n \"Did Eddie get in any serious trouble?\" I asked. I doubted he\u0027d get expelled for something like this, but it would be just my luck that he\u0027d get the punishment he\u0027d saved Angeline from.\\n\\n \"Detention,\" said Jill.\\n\\n \"He accepted it very bravely,\" added Angeline.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he did,\" I said, wondering if either girl knew they were wearing mirror expressions of adoration. \"Look, Angeline, I know the tutoring process must be frustrating, but you have to watch your temper, okay? Trey\u0027s just trying to help.\"\\n\\n She looked skeptical. \"He\u0027s got kind of an attitude sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"I know, but people aren\u0027t exactly lining up to fill his position. We need you here. Jill needs you here. Eddie needs you here.\" I saw some of her indignation fade at the mention of her friends and duty. \"Please try to work with Trey.\"\\n\\n She gave a weak nod, and I stood up to leave. Jill hurried after me into the hallway. \"Hey, Sydney? How was your outing with Marcus?\"\\n\\n \"It was fine,\" I said, certainly not about to dredge up Marcus\u0027s alarming revelations. \"Informative. And I learned how to play Skee-Ball.\"\\n\\n Jill almost looked offended. \"You played Skee-Ball? I thought you were supposed to be learning about the Alchemists\u0027 secret history.\"\\n\\n \"We multitasked,\" I said, not liking her tone.\\n\\n I left before she could comment further and texted Eddie when I reached my room. I heard what happened. Sorry. And thanks. His response was quick: At least it wasn\u0027t a concussion.\\n\\n I braced myself for snark when I went to meet Adrian the next day. Jill had probably told him about my arcade trip, which would probably elicit a comment like, \"Nice to know you\u0027re so dedicated to crack the Alchemists. Way to keep your eye on the ball.\"\\n\\n When I pulled up in front of Adrian\u0027s apartment building, he was already waiting out front for me. As soon as I saw his grim face, my heart stopped. I jumped out of the car, just barely pausing to grab the keys as I went.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I exclaimed, jogging up to him.\\n\\n He rested a hand on my shoulder, but I was too worried to care about the touch. \"Sydney, I don\u0027t want you to freak out. There\u0027s no lasting damage.\"\\n\\n I looked him over. \"Are you okay? Were you hurt?\"\\n\\n For a moment, his somber expression turned puzzled. Then, he understood. \"Oh, you think it\u0027s me? No, I\u0027m fine. Come on.\"\\n\\n He led me around the back of his building, to the private parking lot used by residents. I came to a halt, my jaw dropping as I took in the terrible, ghastly scene. A couple other residents were milling around, and a police officer stood nearby taking notes. Around us, seven parked cars had their tires slashed.\\n\\n Including the Mustang.\\n\\n \"No!\"\\n\\n I ran over to its side, kneeling and examining the damage. I felt like I was in the middle of a war, kneeling by a fallen comrade on the battlefield. I was practically on the verge of shouting, \"Don\u0027t you die on me!\"\\n\\n Adrian crouched beside me. \"The tires can be replaced. I think my insurance will even cover it.\"\\n\\n I was still horrified. \"Who did this?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"Some kids, I guess. They hit a few cars one block over yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"And you didn\u0027t think that was worth mentioning to me?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I didn\u0027t know they were going to come here too. Besides, I knew you\u0027d flip out and want to set up twenty-four-hour surveillance on this place.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not a bad idea.\" I glanced up at his building. \"You should talk to the landlord about it.\"\\n\\n Adrian didn\u0027t seem nearly as concerned as he should have been. \"I don\u0027t know that he\u0027d go for it. I mean, this isn\u0027t really a dangerous neighborhood.\"\\n\\n I pointed at the Mustang. \"Then how come this happened?\"\\n\\n Even though we could take Latte to Los Angeles, we still had to wait around to finish up with the police and then get a tow truck. I made sure the tow truck driver knew that he better not get a scratch on the car, and then I watched mournfully as it was hauled away. Once that sunny splash of yellow disappeared around a corner, I turned to Adrian.\\n\\n \"Ready to go?\"\\n\\n \"Do we have enough time?\"\\n\\n I looked at my cell phone and groaned. We\u0027d burned up a lot of time handling the vandalism aftermath. And yet, I hated to wait until tomorrow, seeing as I\u0027d already lost time yesterday while dealing with Marcus. I called Ms. Terwilliger and asked if she\u0027d cover for me if I came in after curfew.\\n\\n \"Yes, yes, of course,\" she said, in a tone that suggested she couldn\u0027t understand why I\u0027d even bothered calling her. \"Just talk to more of those girls.\"\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger had given me six names. We\u0027d already taken care of Wendy Stone. Three of the girls lived relatively close together, and they were our goal tonight. The last two were closer to the coast, and we hoped to reach them tomorrow. Adrian tried making conversation with me throughout the drive, but my mind was still on the Mustang.\\n\\n \"God, I\u0027m an idiot,\" I said, once we\u0027d almost reached our destination.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s never a term I\u0027d use to describe you,\" he said promptly. \"Articulate. Well dressed. Smart. Organized. Beautiful. I\u0027d use those terms, but never \u0027idiot.\u0027\"\\n\\n I nearly asked why \"beautiful\" had come after \"organized\" and then remembered the actual concern. \"I\u0027m obsessing about that car when girls\u0027 lives are on the line. It\u0027s stupid. My priorities are messed up.\"\\n\\n My eyes were on the road, but I could tell he was smiling. \"If your priorities were really messed up, you would\u0027ve followed that tow truck. Yet here you are, off to help perfect strangers. That\u0027s a noble thing, Sage.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t rule yourself out,\" I said. \"You\u0027re pretty noble too, going on all these outings with me.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s not the same as Skee-Ball, but it\u0027ll have to do. How was that anyway? Did you really learn anything?\"\\n\\n \"I learned a lot - some pretty unbelievable stuff, actually. I\u0027m still waiting to get some proof, though.\"\\n\\n Luck was with us initially. The first two girls were home, though their reactions were similar to Wendy Stone\u0027s. This time, I\u0027d had the foresight to bring the newspaper article, in the hopes it would make a stronger impression. That ghastly picture at least gave them pause, but I left not knowing if they\u0027d really take me seriously or use the agate charms.\\n\\n Our good fortune ran out when we reached the last name. She too was a college student, meaning we had another campus visit. Her name was Lynne Titus, and she lived in a sorority house. I admit, as I knocked on the door, I was fully prepared to find a group of girls dressed in pink, having a pillow fight in their living room. But when we were shown in, we discovered an orderly home not all that different from Wendy\u0027s building. Some girls were coming and going, while others sat around with textbooks and papers.\\n\\n \"Lynne?\" asked the girl who\u0027d let us inside. \"You just missed her.\"\\n\\n I knew this shouldn\u0027t be a surprise. These girls had lives. They wouldn\u0027t all be waiting around for me to come by and talk to them. I glanced uneasily at a window, taking note of the purpling sky. \"Any idea when she\u0027ll be back?\"\\n\\n The girl shook her head. \"No, sorry. I don\u0027t know where she went.\"\\n\\n Adrian and I exchanged looks. \"You\u0027re free from your curfew,\" he reminded me.\\n\\n \"I know. But that doesn\u0027t mean I want to spend all night waiting for Lynne.\" I did some mental calculations. \"I suppose we could wait a couple of hours. Three at most.\"\\n\\n Adrian seemed supremely delighted by this, and I couldn\u0027t help but wonder if he was more excited at hanging out on a college campus . . . or at spending time with me. \"What\u0027s fun to do around here?\" he asked our hostess. He glanced around at the quiet academic environment. \"No raging parties here, huh?\"\\n\\n The girl put on a disapproving expression. \"We\u0027re a very serious sorority. If you\u0027re looking for parties, I guarantee there\u0027s one going on just down the street. Those girls have one every night.\" Adrian shot me a hopeful look.\\n\\n \"Oh, come on,\" I said. \"Can\u0027t we find some nice museum?\"\\n\\n \"We want to stay close, in case Lynne comes back,\" Adrian said. Something told me if the party had been all the way across campus, he still would\u0027ve pushed for it. \"Besides, if you want to go to college so badly, you should see the full scope of what it has to offer. And aren\u0027t you a fan of Greek stuff?\"\\n\\n That was hardly what I had in mind, and he knew it. I reluctantly agreed but warned him he couldn\u0027t drink. I was sporting the brown wig and presumed he was using spirit to mask us further. Alcohol would diminish his ability to pull it all off. Plus, I just didn\u0027t want to see him drunk.\\n\\n It was easy to find the party house because we could hear the music blasting from it. A guy and a girl openly drinking beer from plastic cups challenged us at the door. \"This is Greek only,\" the girl said. She looked as though she might fall off her stool. \"Who are you with?\"\\n\\n I pointed vaguely toward Lynne\u0027s sorority. \"Um, them.\"\\n\\n \"Alpha Yam Ergo,\" said Adrian, without hesitation. I expected the door squad to point out that most of those weren\u0027t even Greek letters. Maybe it was because Adrian spoke so confidently - or because they\u0027d had too much beer - but the guy waved us inside.\\n\\n It was almost like being back at the arcade, an overwhelming flood of stimuli. The house was crowded and loud, with smoke hanging in the air and alcohol flowing freely. Several people offered us drinks, and some girl invited us - three times - to play beer pong, forgetting that she\u0027d already spoken to us. I regarded it all in amazement, trying to keep the disgust off my face.\\n\\n \"What a waste of tuition. This is ruining all my collegiate dreams,\" I shouted to Adrian. \"Isn\u0027t there anything to do that\u0027s not drinking or being stupid?\"\\n\\n He scanned around, able to see more of the room from his greater height. He brightened. \"That looks promising.\" He caught hold of my hand. \"Come on.\"\\n\\n In a surprisingly nice and spacious kitchen, we found several girls sitting on the floor painting blank T-shirts. Judging from the sloppy job and paint spills, they too had been indulging in alcohol. One girl had a cup of beer next to an identical cup of paint, and I hoped she wouldn\u0027t mix them up.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" I asked.\\n\\n One of the girls glanced up and grinned. \"Making shirts for the winter carnival. You want to help?\"\\n\\n Before I could say no, Adrian was already on the ground with them. \"Do I ever.\" He helped himself to a white T-shirt and a brush with blue paint on it. \"What are we putting on these?\" The girls\u0027 shoddy work made that a valid question.\\n\\n \"Our names,\" said one girl.\\n\\n \"Winter stuff,\" said another.\\n\\n That was good enough for Adrian. He set to work painting snowflakes on the shirt. Unable to help myself, I knelt down to get a better look. Whatever his faults, Adrian was a decent artist. He mixed in a few other colors, making the snowflakes intricate and stylized. At one point, he paused to light a clove cigarette, sharing one of the girls\u0027 ashtrays. It was a habit I didn\u0027t really like, but at least the rest of the smoke in this place masked his. As he was finishing up the shirt and writing out the sorority\u0027s name, I noticed that all the other girls had stopped to stare.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s amazing,\" said one, her eyes wide. \"Can I have it?\"\\n\\n \"I want it,\" insisted another.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll make each of you one,\" he assured them. The way they looked at him was an unwelcome reminder of the breadth of his experience with other women. I shifted a little closer to him, just so they wouldn\u0027t get any ideas.\\n\\n He handed the white shirt to the first girl and then set to work on a blue shirt. Once he fulfilled his promise to each girl, he sifted through the T-shirt stack until he found a men\u0027s-size black one. \"Gotta pay tribute to my fraternity.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" I scoffed. \"Alpha Yam Ergo.\"\\n\\n Adrian nodded solemnly. \"A very old and prestigious society\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never heard of them,\" said the girl who\u0027d claimed the first shirt.\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t let many people in,\" he said. In white paint, he wrote his fake fraternity\u0027s initials: AYE.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that what pirates say?\" asked one of the other girls.\\n\\n \"Well, the Alpha Yams have nautical origins,\" he explained. To my horror he began painting a pirate skeleton riding a motorcycle.\\n\\n \"Oh, no,\" I groaned. \"Not the tattoo.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s our logo,\" he said. Adrian and I had once had to investigate a tattoo parlor, and to distract the owner, he\u0027d gone in and pretended to be interested in a tattoo that sounded very much like what he was drawing now. At least, I assumed he\u0027d been pretending. \"Isn\u0027t it badass?\"\\n\\n \"Badass\" wasn\u0027t quite the word I would\u0027ve used, but despite it being such a ridiculous image, he actually did a good job. I made myself comfortable, drawing my knees up to me and leaning against the wall. He soon stopped with his banter and grew completely absorbed in his work, meticulously painting the skeleton\u0027s bones as well as that of a skeleton parrot sitting on the pirate\u0027s shoulder. I studied his features as he worked, fascinated by the joy in his eyes. Art was one of the few things that seemed to anchor him and drive that darkness in him away. He seemed to glow with an inner light, one that enhanced his already handsome features. It was another rare and beautiful glimpse of the intense, passionate nature lying beneath the jokes. It came through in his art. It had come through when he kissed me.\\n\\n Adrian suddenly glanced up at me. Our gazes locked, and I felt like he could read my mind. How often did he think about that kiss? And if he really was crazy about me, did he imagine more than just kissing? Did he fantasize about me? What kinds of things did he think about? His lips on my neck? His hand on my leg? And was that leg bare . . . ?\\n\\n I was afraid of what my eyes might betray and quickly looked away. Desperately, I groped for some witty and nonsentimental comment. \"Don\u0027t forget the ninja throwing stars.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" I could feel Adrian\u0027s gaze on me a few moments longer. There was something tangible to it, a warmth that enveloped me. I didn\u0027t look back until I was certain his attention was again on the shirt. He added the stars and then sat back triumphantly. \"Pretty cool, huh?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not bad,\" I said. In truth, it was kind of amazing.\\n\\n \"You want one too?\" The smile he gave me stirred up those warm feelings again. I couldn\u0027t help but smile back.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have the time,\" I managed to say. \"We\u0027ve got to check on Lynne.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll make you a fast one.\"\\n\\n \"Not the pirate,\" I warned. He found a small purple shirt and began painting on it in silver. \"Purple?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s your color,\" he insisted. A thrill ran through me at his words. Adrian could see auras, the light that surrounded all people and was tied into their personalities. He\u0027d told me that mine was yellow, a color most intellectuals had. But he\u0027d also said I had flares of purple, which indicated a passionate and spiritual nature. Those weren\u0027t qualities I usually thought I possessed . . . but sometimes, I wished I did.\\n\\n I watched, enthralled, as he painted a large silver heart with flames edging one side. The whole design was Celtic in style. It was beautiful.\\n\\n \"Where did you get that from?\" I asked in awe. I\u0027d seen a lot of his work but never anything like this.\\n\\n His eyes were on his heart, completely caught up in his work. \"Just something kicking around in my head. Reminds me of you. Fiery and sweet, all at the same time. A flame in the dark, lighting my way.\" His voice . . . his words . . . I recognized one of his spirit-driven moments. It should\u0027ve unnerved me, but there was something sensual about the way he spoke, something that made my breath catch. A flame in the dark.\\n\\n He swapped out the silver paintbrush for a black one. Before I could stop him, he wrote over the heart: AYE. Underneath it, in smaller letters, he added: HONORARY MEMBER.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" I cried. The spell had shattered. \"You ruined it!\"\\n\\n Adrian regarded me with a mischievous look. \"I figured you\u0027d be flattered at being accepted as an honorary member.\"\\n\\n \"How can I get in?\" asked one of the girls.\\n\\n In spite of my outrage, I took the shirt when he offered it to me. I held it up gingerly, careful not to mess up the paint job. Even through the ridiculous words, the fiery heart was still stunning. It shone through, and I couldn\u0027t stop admiring it. How could someone so irreverent create something so beautiful? When I finally looked up again, I found Adrian watching me. That earlier thrall seized me, and I found myself unable to move.\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t painted anything,\" he said softly.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because I have zero creativity,\" I told him.\\n\\n \"Everyone\u0027s got some creativity,\" he insisted. He handed me the silver brush and slid over to join me against the wall. Our legs and arms touched. He laid out his own AYE shirt across his lap. \"Go ahead. Add something, anything.\"\\n\\n I shook my head in protest and tried to hand him the brush. \"I can\u0027t draw or paint. I\u0027ll ruin it.\"\\n\\n \"Sydney.\" He pushed the brush back into my hand. \"It\u0027s a pirate skeleton, not the Mona Lisa. You\u0027re not going to decrease its value.\"\\n\\n Maybe not, but I had a hard time imagining what I could possibly add to this. I could do a lot of things, but this was out of my league - especially compared to his skill. Something in his expression drove me, however, and after a lot of thought, I gave my best shot at drawing a tie around the skeleton\u0027s neck. Adrian frowned.\\n\\n \"Is that a noose?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a tie!\" I cried, trying not to feel offended.\\n\\n He laughed, clearly delighted at this. \"My mistake.\"\\n\\n \"He can go to a boardroom meeting,\" I added, feeling a need to defend my work. \"He\u0027s very proper now.\"\\n\\n Adrian seemed to like that even more. \"Of course he is. Proper and dangerous.\" A little of his mirth faded, and he grew pensive as he studied me, holding me in his gaze. \"Just like you.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d been so worried about the artistic challenge that I wasn\u0027t aware of just how close he\u0027d moved to me until now. So many details came into focus. The shape of his lips, the line of his neck. \"I\u0027m not dangerous,\" I breathed.\\n\\n He brought his face toward mine. \"You are to me.\"\\n\\n And somehow, against all reason, we were kissing. I closed my eyes, and the world around me faded. The noise, the smoke . . . it was gone. All that mattered was the taste of his mouth, a mix of cloves and mints. There was a fierceness in his kiss, a desperation . . . and I answered, just as hungry for him. I didn\u0027t stop him when he pulled me closer, so that I almost sat on his lap. I\u0027d never been wrapped around someone\u0027s body like that, and I was shocked at how eagerly mine responded. His arm went around my waist, pulling me onto him further, and his other hand slid up the back of my neck, getting entangled in my hair. Amazingly, the wig stayed on. He took his lips away from my mouth, gently trailing kisses down to my neck. I tipped my head back, gasping when the intensity returned to his mouth. There was an animalistic quality that sent shock waves through the rest of my body. Some Alchemist voice warned me that this was exactly how a vampire would feed, but I had no fear. Adrian wouldn\u0027t hurt me, and I needed to know just how hard he could kiss me and -\\n\\n \"Oh my God!\"\\n\\n Adrian and I jerked apart as though someone had thrown cold water on us, though our legs stayed entangled. I glanced around in a panic, half expecting to see an outraged Stanton standing over us. Instead, I looked up into the terrified face of a girl I didn\u0027t know. She wasn\u0027t even looking at us.\\n\\n \"You guys won\u0027t believe what happened!\" she exclaimed, directing her words to our fellow artists. She pointed vaguely behind her. \"Over across the street at Kappa, they found one of their girls unconscious, and they can\u0027t wake her up. I don\u0027t know what happened, but it sounds like she was attacked. There\u0027s police out front and everything.\"\\n\\n Adrian and I stared at each other for one shocked moment. Then, wordlessly, we both stood up. He held my hand to steady me until my trembling legs strengthened. I\u0027m weak because of this news, I told myself. Not because I was just making out with a vampire.\\n\\n But those dangerous and intoxicating kisses faded almost instantly when we returned to Lynne\u0027s sorority. It was busy with frightened people, and campus security moved in and out, allowing us to step right inside the open door.\\n\\n \"What happened?\" I asked a brunette standing nearby.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Lynne,\" she said, biting her lips. \"They just found her in an empty auditorium.\"\\n\\n Something in the way she spoke made me uneasy. \"Is she . . . alive?\"\\n\\n The girl nodded. \"I don\u0027t know . . . I think so, but they said there\u0027s something really wrong. She\u0027s unconscious and looks . . . well . . . old.\"\\n\\n I met Adrian\u0027s eyes and vaguely noticed he had silver paint in his hair. I\u0027d still been holding the brush when I\u0027d wrapped my arms around him. \"Damn,\" he murmured. \"Too late.\"\\n\\n I wanted to scream in frustration. We\u0027d been so close to warning her. She\u0027d allegedly left just before we\u0027d arrived. What if we\u0027d come sooner? What if we\u0027d visited her before the other two girls? I\u0027d chosen the order randomly. Worse, what if we\u0027d been able to find her instead of having art time with the drunken sorority girls?\\n\\n What if I hadn\u0027t been all over Adrian? Or maybe he\u0027d been all over me. Whatever you wanted to call it, I hadn\u0027t exactly resisted.\\n\\n The more we learned, however, the more unlikely it seemed we would\u0027ve been able to do anything if we\u0027d stuck around Lynne\u0027s house and investigated. Nobody knew where she\u0027d gone. Only one person had seen her leave, a girl with curly blond hair who frustrated the campus police with her vague answers.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she kept saying. \"I just . . . I can\u0027t remember the girl she left with.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing?\" asked one of the officers. \"Height? Age? Hair color?\"\\n\\n The girl frowned, looking as though she was using every ounce of mental effort. At last, she sagged in defeat and shook her head. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Did she have black hair?\" I suggested.\\n\\n The girl brightened a little. \"Maybe. Er, wait. It might have been brown. No. Red, maybe?\"\\n\\n Adrian and I stepped away, knowing we could do no more. \"That girl seems awfully confused,\" I said as we walked back to my car.\\n\\n \"She certainly does,\" he agreed. \"Sound familiar?\"\\n\\n \"Very,\" I muttered, recognizing the signs of magic.\\n\\n No one could deny it. Veronica had been here. And we\u0027d been too late to stop her.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-11.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
