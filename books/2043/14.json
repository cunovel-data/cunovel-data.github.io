{"id":109604,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"SUNDAY ROLLED AROUND, and the day started off quietly. We were nearing the point when Veronica might strike again, and my stomach was in knots over what her next step would be . . . and how stuck we were on how to stop her. Then I received help from an unexpected source when my phone rang with an unknown number on the display.\\n\\n Normally, I wouldn\u0027t answer something like that, but my life was hardly normal these days. Besides, it was a Los Angeles area code.\\n\\n \"Hello?\"\\n\\n \"Hi! Is this Taylor?\"\\n\\n It took me a moment to remember my secret identity. I did not, however, recall giving my actual number to any of the girls we\u0027d warned about Veronica.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said warily.\\n\\n \"This is Alicia, from Old World Bed-and-Breakfast.\"\\n\\n \"Hi,\" I said, still puzzled as to why and how she\u0027d be calling me.\\n\\n Her voice was as cheery and bright as when we\u0027d met her. \"I wanted to know if you\u0027d thought any more about getting a room for your anniversary.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, well . . . that. We\u0027re still deciding. But, uh, probably we\u0027re going to go with something closer to the coast. You know, romantic beach walks and all that.\"\\n\\n \"I can totally understand,\" she said, though she sounded disappointed at the loss of a sale. \"If you change your mind, just let me know. We\u0027re running a special this month, so you could get the Bunny Suite at a really good price. I remember you saying it reminded you of your pet rabbit. What was his name?\"\\n\\n \"Hopper,\" I said flatly.\\n\\n \"Hopper! That\u0027s right. Such a sweet name.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, awesome.\" I tried to think of a polite way to phrase my next question but simply chose directness. \"Look, Alicia, how did you get this number?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Jet gave it to me.\"\\n\\n \"He did?\"\\n\\n \"Yup.\" She\u0027d apparently gotten over her disappointment and now sounded bright and chirpy again. \"He filled out an info card while you guys were here and put down your number.\"\\n\\n I nearly groaned. Typical.\\n\\n \"Good to know,\" I said. I wondered how often Adrian gave my number out. \"Thanks for following up.\"\\n\\n \"Happy to. Oh!\" She giggled. \"I nearly forgot. Your friend is back.\"\\n\\n I froze. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Veronica. She checked back in yesterday.\"\\n\\n My first reaction was excitement. My second one was panic. \"Did you tell her we were asking about her?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no. I remembered you saying you wanted to surprise her.\"\\n\\n I nearly sank in relief. \"Thank you. We, uh, wouldn\u0027t to ruin that. We\u0027ll have to stop by and visit - but don\u0027t tell her.\"\\n\\n \"You can count on me!\"\\n\\n We disconnected, and I stared at the phone. Veronica was back. Just when we thought we\u0027d lost all leads on her. I immediately called Ms. Terwilliger but was sent to voice mail. I left a message and then followed up with a text, saying I had urgent news. My phone rang again, just as I was about to call Adrian. I almost hoped Alicia had more to tell me, but then I saw that it was Stanton\u0027s number. After first taking a deep breath, I tried to answer in as calm a way as possible.\\n\\n \"Miss Sage,\" she said. \"I received your message yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am. Thank you for calling me back.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d called her yesterday, just before meeting up with Adrian. Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s magical training had taken priority at the time, but I hadn\u0027t forgotten my deal with Marcus.\\n\\n \"I have a, um, favor to ask,\" I continued.\\n\\n Stanton, who was rarely surprised, was clearly surprised now. \"You\u0027re certainly entitled to ask . . . but you\u0027re just not usually the type who does.\"\\n\\n \"I know, and I feel bad. So, if you have to say no, I understand.\" In truth, if she said no, I would have a number of problems on my hands, but it was best not to sound too eager. \"Well, I\u0027ve been thinking about how I have to spend Christmas here - with the Moroi. And I definitely understand that, ma\u0027am. It\u0027s part of the mission, but . . . well, I\u0027d be lying if I said that didn\u0027t bother me. So, I was wondering if there\u0027s any way at all I\u0027d be allowed to go to one of the big holiday services. It would make me feel . . . oh, I don\u0027t know. More connected. Purified, even. I\u0027m just always surrounded by them here, by that taint, you know? I feel like I can\u0027t even breathe half the time. That probably sounds ridiculous.\"\\n\\n I cut my rambling off. When Marcus had first suggested taking advantage of knowing someone in St. Louis, I\u0027d immediately thought of Ian. Then I realized that wasn\u0027t enough. Alchemists on assignment couldn\u0027t just ask for casual time off to visit friends. Time off for something more spiritual and group-oriented - say, the Alchemists\u0027 annual holiday services - was a different matter. Lots of Alchemists were given clearance to travel and attend those services. They were tied to our faith and group unity. In fact, Ian had even brought it up at the wedding in the hopes of luring me to visit him. Little had he known his trick would pay off. Kind of.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t sound that ridiculous,\" Stanton said. That was promising, and I tried to unclench my fist and relax.\\n\\n \"I was thinking maybe I could go before we\u0027re out for winter break,\" I added. \"Jill can stay within the confines of the school, so there shouldn\u0027t be too much risk. And Eddie and Angeline are always with her. I could just hop over to St. Louis for a quick weekend trip.\"\\n\\n \"St. Louis?\" I could almost see her frown through the phone. \"There are services in Phoenix as well. That would be much closer.\"\\n\\n \"I know, ma\u0027am. It\u0027s just. . . .\" I hoped being genuinely nervous would help me sound convincing. \"I, uh, was hoping I could also see Ian again.\"\\n\\n \"Ah. I see.\" There was a long pause. \"I find that more surprising than you wanting to attend services. From what I saw at the wedding, you didn\u0027t seem to be that charmed by Mr. Jansen.\"\\n\\n So. I\u0027d been right that Stanton had noticed his crush on me. However, she\u0027d also noticed I didn\u0027t return his affection. She was observant, even to little details, which brought Marcus\u0027s warnings back to me, about how the Alchemists paid attention to everything we did. I started to understand his fears and why he pulled his recruits out of the Alchemists so quickly Was I already attracting attention? Were all the little things I did - even asking for this - slowly building a case against me?\\n\\n Again, I hoped my anxiety simply made me sound like a flustered, love-struck girl, one Stanton would feel sorry for and shake her head over. St. Louis wasn\u0027t that much farther away by plane, and the end result was the same. \"Well, that was business, ma\u0027am. I didn\u0027t want to get distracted from our goal.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" Her next pause was only a few seconds long, but it felt like an hour. \"Well, I see no reason why you can\u0027t go. You\u0027ve done an admirable job in your work, and - from a personal point of view - I can understand why you\u0027d want to be with familiar faces again. You\u0027ve spent more time with the Moroi than many Alchemists ever will in their lives, and you didn\u0027t hesitate when that Ivashkov pushed himself onto you at the wedding.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t really hesitate when he pushed himself onto me at the sorority, either. Or did I push myself on him?\\n\\n \"Thank you, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n She authorized me to go next weekend and said I could use Alchemist funds to book my travel arrangements. When we got off the phone, I contemplated calling Ian but then decided on a more impersonal approach. I jotted out a quick email telling him that I\u0027d be in town and that I hoped we could meet up. After a few moments of thought, I then texted Marcus: Arrangements made.\\n\\n Lunchtime came around, and Eddie texted to ask if I could meet Jill and him in my dorm\u0027s cafeteria. I headed downstairs at the appropriate time and found a glum Eddie sitting by himself at a table. I wondered where Angeline was and noted he hadn\u0027t mentioned her in his text. Rather than bring that up, I focused on who he had mentioned.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Jill?\"\\n\\n He nodded toward the opposite side of the cafeteria. I followed his gaze and saw Jill standing near a table, laughing and talking. She held a tray and looked as though she\u0027d been stopped on her way back from the food line. Micah and some other guys were at the table, and I was happy to see he did indeed seem comfortable with being her friend again.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s nice,\" I said, turning back to my own food. \"I\u0027m glad she\u0027s getting along with everyone.\"\\n\\n Eddie stared at me in amazement. \"Don\u0027t you see what\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d been about to bite into an apple and stopped. I hated these kinds of loaded questions. They meant I\u0027d missed out on some social subtlety - something that wasn\u0027t my strong suit. Glancing back at Jill, I tried to make my best guess.\\n\\n \"Is Micah trying to get back together with her?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" said Eddie, like I should\u0027ve known. \"He\u0027s going out with Claire Cipriano now.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry. I can\u0027t keep track of everyone\u0027s dating lives. I\u0027ll add it to my to-do list after, you know, busting Alchemist conspiracies and finding out whether the Warriors are after Jill.\"\\n\\n Eddie\u0027s gaze was locked on Jill, and he nodded, making me think he hadn\u0027t actually heard a word I\u0027d said. \"Travis and Juan want to ask her out.\"\\n\\n \"So? She learned her lesson about human and vampire dating.\" I wished I had. \"She\u0027ll tell them no.\"\\n\\n \"They still shouldn\u0027t be bothering her,\" he growled.\\n\\n Jill didn\u0027t seem to be particularly bothered by their attention. In fact, I liked seeing her bright and smiling for a change. Confidence suited her and emphasized her royal status, and she clearly was enjoying whatever banter was going on. One thing I\u0027d learned in my social education was that flirting wasn\u0027t the same thing as going out with someone. My friend Julia was an expert at the difference. If it made Jill happy, I certainly had no problems with it.\\n\\n Honestly, it looked like the person who was most bothered by Jill\u0027s suitors was Eddie. He theoretically had the excuse of wanting to protect her, but this seemed pretty personal. I decided to bring him back to his own romantic life, the one he should actually be concerned about.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Angeline?\"\\n\\n Jill began walking toward us. Looking relieved, Eddie turned back to me. \"Well, that\u0027s what we wanted to talk to you about.\"\\n\\n Whenever anyone wanted to talk to me, it meant something weird was about to happen. Actual emergency issues were never given an introduction. They were just delivered immediately. This premeditated stuff was a wild card.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked once Jill sat down. \"With Angeline?\"\\n\\n She exchanged a knowing glance with Eddie. \"We think Angeline\u0027s up to something,\" she said. A moment later, she clarified, \"Something bad.\"\\n\\n Not this again. I turned to Eddie. \"Is she still being distant?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. She had lunch with us yesterday.\" He frowned. \"But she was acting weird. She wouldn\u0027t explain why she\u0027s been so busy.\"\\n\\n Jill concurred. \"She actually got really upset the more we kept questioning her. It was strange. I think she\u0027s in some kind of trouble.\"\\n\\n I leaned back in my chair. \"The kind of trouble Angeline gets into is usually spontaneous and unexpected. You\u0027re talking like she\u0027s masterminding something in secret. That\u0027s not her style. At worst, she\u0027s harboring an illicit wardrobe.\"\\n\\n Eddie looked like he wanted to smile but couldn\u0027t quite manage it. \"True.\"\\n\\n Jill apparently wasn\u0027t convinced. \"You have to talk to her. Find out what\u0027s going on.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you talk to her?\" I asked, looking between their faces. \"You live with her.\"\\n\\n \"We tried,\" protested Jill. \"I told you. She just got mad the more we talked.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I can understand that,\" I snapped. \"Look, I\u0027m sorry something weird is going on with her. And I don\u0027t want her in trouble, believe me. But there\u0027s only so much hand-holding I can do with her. I fixed her math problem. My job is to make sure she stays in school and doesn\u0027t blow your cover. Everything else is extraneous, and I just don\u0027t have time for that. And if she wouldn\u0027t talk to you, why on earth do you think she\u0027d talk to me?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d spoken a bit more harshly than I intended. I really did care about them all. I also didn\u0027t want trouble in the group. Nonetheless, it was always a little frustrating when they came to me with dramas like this, as though I were their mother. They were some of the smartest, most competent people I knew. They didn\u0027t need me, and Angeline was no criminal genius. Figuring out her motives couldn\u0027t be that difficult.\\n\\n Neither one of them had an immediate response for me. \"You just always seem to get through to people,\" Jill said at last. \"You\u0027re good at communication.\"\\n\\n That certainly wasn\u0027t a compliment I heard very often. \"I don\u0027t do anything special. I\u0027m just persistent. Keep trying, and maybe you\u0027ll get through.\" Seeing Jill start to protest, I added, \"Please. Don\u0027t ask me to do this right now. You both know I\u0027ve got a lot going on.\"\\n\\n I gave each of them a meaningful look. Both knew about Marcus, and Jill also knew about Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s sister. After a few moments, that knowledge set in, and they both looked a little embarrassed.\\n\\n Eddie gave Jill a gentle nudge. \"She\u0027s right. We should keep working on Angeline ourselves.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" said Jill. My relief was short-lived. \"We\u0027ll try a little more. Then, if it still doesn\u0027t work, Sydney can step in.\"\\n\\n I groaned.\\n\\n When I parted ways from them later, I couldn\u0027t help but think again about Marcus\u0027s comments in San Bernardino about how Alchemists got caught up in menial tasks. I tried to reassure myself that Jill and Eddie would take care of this on their own, meaning I wouldn\u0027t actually have to intervene. Presuming, of course, Angeline really wasn\u0027t planning something catastrophic.\\n\\n Unfortunately, those doubts were soon shaken when I got on the shuttle that would take me to main campus. On weekends, there was only one bus that looped between all buildings, and this one had just picked up at the boys\u0027 dorm. I found Trey sitting in it, staring out the window with a happy expression. When he saw me, his smile vanished.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I said, taking a seat beside him. He actually looked nervous. \"Off to study?\"\\n\\n \"Meeting with Angeline, actually.\"\\n\\n There was no escaping her today, but at least if she was working on math, it seemed unlikely she\u0027d be staging a coup or committing arson. His troubled expression concerned me, though.\\n\\n \"She . . . she didn\u0027t hit you again?\" I didn\u0027t see any noticeable marks, but with her, you could never tell.\\n\\n \"Huh? No, no. Not recently.\" He hesitated before speaking again. \"Melbourne, how long are you going to need me to do this?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Mostly I\u0027d been focusing on getting her through the present, not the future. One thing at a time. \"She\u0027ll have her final coming up before break. If she passes, then I guess you\u0027re home free. Unless you want to keep up with it after break - I mean, provided she doesn\u0027t wear you out.\"\\n\\n This startled him a lot more than I would have expected. \"Okay. Good to know.\"\\n\\n He looked so forlorn when he left to go to the library that I wondered if those chemistry answers had really been worth it. I liked Trey. I\u0027d never thought inflicting Angeline on him would so radically alter his life. I guessed that was just the kind of effect she had on the world.\\n\\n I watched him walk away for a few more seconds and then turned toward the science building. One of the teachers, Ms. Whittaker, was an amateur botanist who was always happy to supply Ms. Terwilliger with various plants and herbs. She thought Ms. Terwilliger used them for home craft projects, like potpourri and candles, and I frequently had to pick up the latest supplies. When I walked into her classroom today, Ms. Whittaker was grading exams at her desk.\\n\\n \"Hi, Sydney,\" she said, barely looking up. \"I set it all over there, on the far counter.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n I walked over and was surprised to practically find a spice cabinet. Ms. Terwilliger had requested all sorts of leaves, stems, and clippings. It was the most I\u0027d ever had to pick up for her.\\n\\n \"She sure had a big order this time,\" Ms. Whittaker remarked, as though sensing my thoughts. \"Is she really using garlic in potpourri?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s for some, um, cooking she\u0027s doing. You know, holidays and all.\"\\n\\n She nodded and returned to her work. One thing that often helped in Alchemist affairs (and witch ones) was that people rarely expected supernatural reasons for weird behaviors and phenomena.\\n\\n I almost considered visiting Trey and Angeline at the library, just to assess her behavior myself, but decided it\u0027d be better to not get involved. Eddie and Jill would handle it. With nothing else to do, I dared to hope I might actually just be able to stay inside and read today. But, when I returned to my dorm, I was greeted with the astonishing sight of Marcus sitting outside on a bench, playing an acoustic guitar. A group of four girls stood around, listening in awe. I walked up to the circle, my arms crossed over my chest.\\n\\n \"Really?\" I asked.\\n\\n Marcus glanced up and shot me a grin. One of the girls actually cooed.\\n\\n \"Hey, Sydney.\"\\n\\n Four sets of eyes turned to me, displaying a mix of both disbelief and jealousy. \"Hey,\" I said. \"You\u0027re the last person I expected to see here.\"\\n\\n \"I never do what\u0027s predictable.\" He tossed his hair back and started to put his guitar back in its case. \"Sorry, girls. Sydney and I have to talk.\"\\n\\n I got more of those stares, which kind of annoyed me. Was it really that unbelievable that a good-looking guy would want to talk to me? His followers dispersed reluctantly, and Marcus and I strolled around the grounds.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you supposed to be in hiding?\" I asked. \"Not panhandling with your guitar?\"\\n\\n \"I never asked them for money. Besides, I\u0027m incognito today.\" He tapped his cheek, and I noticed the tattoo was barely noticeable.\\n\\n \"Are you wearing makeup?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t judge,\" he said. \"It lets me move around more freely. Sabrina helped color match me.\"\\n\\n We came to a halt in a relatively private copse of trees. \"So why are you here? Why didn\u0027t you call or text?\"\\n\\n \"Because I have a delivery.\" He reached into his shirt pocket and handed me a folded piece of paper that looked like it had traveled around the world before reaching me. When I opened it and managed to smooth it out, I saw several painstakingly drawn diagrams. I jerked my gaze back to him.\\n\\n \"Wade\u0027s floor plans.\"\\n\\n \"As promised.\" A little of that self-satisfaction faded, and he actually looked impressed. \"You\u0027ve really got a way to get to St. Louis?\"\\n\\n \"Sanctioned and everything,\" I said. \"I mean, aside from the part where I break into their servers. But I\u0027ve got a few ideas on how to pull that off.\"\\n\\n He laughed. \"Of course you do. I won\u0027t bother asking. Every girl\u0027s got her secrets. Maybe someday you\u0027ll share yours.\" From the tone of his voice, he might have been talking about non-professional secrets. \"Once this is all over.\"\\n\\n \"Is it ever over?\" I asked. I meant it as a joke, but it came out sounding a bit more melancholy than I would\u0027ve liked.\\n\\n He gave me a long, level look. \"No, not really. But getting the tattoo sealed in Mexico is kind of fun. I hope you\u0027ll go with us. At the very least, we can take in some beaches and margaritas while undoing insidious magic. Do you own a bikini?\"\\n\\n \"No. And I don\u0027t drink.\"\\n\\n \"Well, maybe one of these days we could go out for coffee. I know you drink that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m pretty busy,\" I said, thinking of everything weighing on me. \"And you know, I also haven\u0027t decided if I\u0027m going to do the first phase of tattoo breaking.\"\\n\\n \"You should, Sydney.\" He was all business again and tapped my cheek. \"If nothing else, do that. Don\u0027t let them have any more control over you than they have to. I know you think we\u0027re a little out there, but this is one thing we\u0027re absolutely serious about.\"\\n\\n \"Hi, Sydney.\"\\n\\n I glanced over and saw my friend Julia Cavendish carrying a huge stack of books. A couple seconds later, Marcus looked up at her too. Her eyes went wide, and she stumbled and dropped everything she was carrying. She flushed.\\n\\n \"Oh, God. I\u0027m such an idiot.\"\\n\\n I started to help her, but Marcus was by her side in a flash, his movie star grin firmly in place. \"Happens to the best of us. I\u0027m Dave.\"\\n\\n \"J-Julia,\" she said. In all the time I\u0027d known her, I\u0027d never seen her flustered around a guy. She usually ate them for breakfast.\\n\\n \"There we are.\" He handed her the books, all neatly stacked.\\n\\n \"Thank you. Thank you so much. You didn\u0027t have to do that. I mean, it was my own fault. I\u0027m not usually that clumsy. And I\u0027m sure you\u0027re busy. You must have lots to do. Obviously.\" I\u0027d also never heard Julia ramble.\\n\\n Marcus patted her on the back, and I thought she might pass out. \"Always happy to help a beautiful damsel in distress.\" He nodded in my direction. \"I\u0027ve got to go. Sydney, I\u0027ll be in touch.\"\\n\\n I nodded back. As soon as he walked away, Julia dropped the books again and hurried over to me. \"Sydney, you have to tell me who that is.\"\\n\\n \"He already did. Dave.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but who is he?\" She gripped my arm and seemed on the verge of shaking answers out of me.\\n\\n \"Just a guy I know.\" I thought about it more. \"A friend, I guess.\"\\n\\n Her breath caught. \"You guys aren\u0027t - I mean - \"\\n\\n \"What? No! Why would you think that?\"\\n\\n \"Well, he\u0027s gorgeous,\" she said, as though that were enough to make us soul mates. \"Don\u0027t you want to just rip his clothes off?\"\\n\\n \"Whoa, no way.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" She scrutinized me, like I might be joking. \"Not even a little?\"\\n\\n \"Nope.\"\\n\\n She stepped back and started picking up her books. \"Jeez, Syd. I don\u0027t know what to think of you sometimes. I mean, I\u0027m glad he\u0027s available - he is available, right? - but I\u0027d be all over that if I were you.\"\\n\\n Jill\u0027s words came back to me, about how he was human and had \"that rebel Alchemist\" thing going for him. Maybe I should start considering him or another ex-Alchemist as a romantic option. Having someone who wasn\u0027t a forbidden vampire in my life would make things a lot easier. I tried to dredge up the same reaction other girls had around Marcus, but nothing happened. No matter how hard I tried, I just didn\u0027t have that same attraction. His hair was too blond, I decided. And his eyes needed a little more green.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" I told Julia. \"Just not feeling it.\"\\n\\n \"If you say so. I still think you\u0027re crazy. That\u0027s the kind of guy you\u0027d follow to hell and back.\"\\n\\n All romantic musings disappeared, and I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach as we slowly headed back toward the dorm. Hell was a good analogy for what I would be walking into. \"You actually might be closer to the truth on that than you realize.\"\\n\\n She brightened. \"See? I knew you couldn\u0027t resist.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-14.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
