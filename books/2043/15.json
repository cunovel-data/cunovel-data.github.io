{"id":109605,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"MS. TERWILLIGER WAS WAITING in the lobby when Julia and I returned to the dorm. \"Seriously. Do you have a tracking device on me?\" I asked. Julia took one look at our teacher\u0027s serious expression and quickly made an exit. \"Just excellent timing,\" Ms. Terwilliger replied. \"I understand you have news.\" \"Surprisingly, yes.\" Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s face was hard as she led me back outside to more privacy and yet another top secret outdoor meeting. These days, she hardly resembled the scattered, hippie teacher I\u0027d met when I first started at Amberwood. \"Tell me the news,\" she ordered. I told her about Alicia\u0027s call, and her dismayed expression didn\u0027t really inspire me. I\u0027d kind of hoped she\u0027d reveal some amazing, foolproof plan she\u0027d secretly been concocting. \"Well, then,\" she said once I\u0027d finished. \"I suppose I\u0027ll have to go out there.\" \"I\u0027ll go out there,\" I corrected. She favored me with a small smile. \"You\u0027ve done more than enough. It\u0027s time I step up and deal with Veronica.\" \"But you sent me to that place before.\" \"When we weren\u0027t even sure where it was or what she was doing there. This time, we have an eyewitness confirming she\u0027s there right now. I can\u0027t waste this opportunity.\" She glanced at a clock near the door and sighed. \"I\u0027d go tonight if I could but haven\u0027t made the necessary preparations. I\u0027ll start working on them now and go in tomorrow evening. Hopefully I won\u0027t miss her again.\" \"No.\" The defiance in my voice surprised even me. I didn\u0027t contradict teachers - or any kind of authority - very often. Okay, never. \"She eluded us before. Let us scout it out. You don\u0027t want to tip your hand yet, just in case something goes wrong. You\u0027ll be ready tomorrow night? Then let us go in the day . . . I mean, provided someone could get me out of school. . . .\" A little of that tension faded, and she laughed. \"I suppose I could do that. I hate that I keep putting you in danger, though.\" \"We passed that point a long time ago.\" She couldn\u0027t argue against that logic. I made arrangements for Adrian to pick me up the next day - after first scolding \"Jet\" for giving out \"Taylor\u0027s\" number. When morning came, Ms. Terwilliger was true to her word. I\u0027d been excused from classes for a \"research trip.\" The thing about being a star pupil was that none of my teachers had any problems with me skipping classes. They knew I\u0027d get the work done. I probably could\u0027ve taken the rest of the semester off. During the drive, I told Adrian that I\u0027d managed to score a trip to St. Louis in order to pursue Marcus\u0027s daunting task. Adrian\u0027s expression grew darker and darker, but he stayed silent on the matter. I knew what a conflict it was for him. He didn\u0027t like Marcus. He didn\u0027t like me taking on this potentially dangerous mission. However, he also trusted me to make my own decisions. Contradicting me or telling me what to do wasn\u0027t in his nature - even though he secretly may have wanted to. His only comment was one of support. \"Be careful, Sage. For God\u0027s sake, be careful. I\u0027ve seen you pull off some crazy shit, but this is extreme, even for you. You\u0027re probably the only one who can manage this, but still . . . don\u0027t let your guard down, even for a moment.\" When I told him about how I was hoping to use Ian to get more in-depth access, Adrian\u0027s troubled look turned to one of incredulity. \"Hold on here. Let me make sure I\u0027m following this. You\u0027re going to seduce some guy to help you with your espionage.\" Seduce Ian? Ugh. \"Don\u0027t jump to conclusions,\" I warned. \"I\u0027m just going to try to use his feelings for me to get what I want.\" \"Wow. Cold, Sage. Very cold.\" \"Hey, now.\" I felt a little indignant at the accusation. \"I\u0027m not going to promise to marry him or something and then dump him later. He wrote me about going to dinner when I\u0027m there. We\u0027ll have a nice time, and I\u0027ll try to talk him into letting me tour the facility. That\u0027s it.\" \"And \u0027talking him into it\u0027 doesn\u0027t involve putting out?\" I glared at him and hoped he could see me in his periphery. \"Adrian. Do I really seem like the kind of person who\u0027d do that?\" \"Well - \" He stopped, and I suspected he\u0027d held back from some snarky comment. \"No, I suppose not. Certainly not with a guy like him. Did you get a dress?\" Here we were again, Adrian randomly jumping topics. \"For dinner and the service? I\u0027ve got plenty.\" \"I guess that answers my question.\" He seemed to wage a great mental battle. At last, he said, \"I\u0027m going to give you some advice.\" \"Oh no.\" He looked over at me again. \"Who knows more about male weakness: you or me?\" \"Go on.\" I refused to directly answer the question. \"Get a new dress. One that shows a lot of skin. Short. Strapless. Maybe a push-up bra too.\" He actually had the audacity to do a quick assessment of my chest. \"Eh, maybe not. But definitely some high heels.\" \"Adrian,\" I exclaimed. \"You\u0027ve seen how Alchemists dress. Do you think I can really wear something like that into a church service?\" He was unconcerned. \"You\u0027ll make it work. You\u0027ll change clothes or something. But I\u0027m telling you, if you want to get a guy to do something that might be difficult, then the best way is to distract him so that he can\u0027t devote his full brainpower to the consequences.\" \"You don\u0027t have a lot of faith in your own gender.\" \"Hey, I\u0027m telling you the truth. I\u0027ve been distracted by sexy dresses a lot.\" I didn\u0027t really know if that was a valid argument, seeing as Adrian was distracted by a lot of things. Fondue. T-shirts. Kittens. \"And so, what then? I show some skin, and the world is mine?\" \"That\u0027ll help.\" Amazingly, I could tell he was dead serious. \"And you\u0027ve gotta act confident the whole time, like it\u0027s already a done deal. Then make sure when you\u0027re actually asking for what you want that you tell him you\u0027d be \u0027so, so grateful.\u0027 But don\u0027t elaborate. His imagination will do half the work for you. \" I shook my head, glad we\u0027d almost reached our destination. I didn\u0027t know how much more I could listen to. \"This is the most ridiculous advice I\u0027ve ever heard. It\u0027s also kind of sexist too, but I can\u0027t decide who it offends more, men or women.\" \"Look, Sage. I don\u0027t know much about chemistry or computer hacking or photosynthery but this is something I\u0027ve got a lot of experience with.\" I think he meant photosynthesis, but I didn\u0027t correct him. \"Use my knowledge. Don\u0027t let it go to waste.\" He seemed so earnest that I finally told him I\u0027d consider it, though I had a hard time imagining myself wearing anything like he\u0027d described. My answer satisfied him, and he said no more. When we reached the bed-and-breakfast, I put on the brown wig so that we could be Taylor and Jet again. I braced myself as we approached the door. \"Who knows what we\u0027re walking into?\" I murmured. I\u0027d been very brave while speaking to Ms. Terwilliger, but the reality that I might be going right up to an evil sorceress was sinking in. I had yet to develop the ability to sense magic in others, so I could very well be taken by surprise if she had a way to hide her appearance too. All I could do was have faith that Adrian\u0027s spirit and Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s charm would mask me. If Veronica was there, we\u0027d just seem like an ordinary couple. I hoped. Alicia was reading another magazine when we walked in. She still sported the same hipster glasses and clutter of gaudy necklaces. Her face lit up when she saw us. \"You\u0027re back.\" Adrian\u0027s arm immediately went around me. \"Well, when we heard Veronica was in town again, we wanted to come see her right away. Right, honeydew?\" \"Right,\" I said. At least he was going with healthier nicknames today. \"Oh.\" Alicia\u0027s sunny smile dimmed a little. \"She just left.\" \"You have got to be kidding,\" I said. How could our luck be this bad? \"So, she checked out?\" \"No, she\u0027s still renting out the Velvet Suite. I think she was just running errands. But. . . .\" She turned sheepish. \"I may have, uh, ruined the surprise.\" \"Oh?\" I asked very carefully. I felt Adrian\u0027s hold on me tense, but there was nothing romantic about it. \"I couldn\u0027t resist. I told her she might have some unexpected visitors soon. Good visitors,\" she added. \"I wanted to make sure she didn\u0027t stay out too long.\" \"That\u0027s very nice of you,\" said Adrian. His smile looked as strained as mine felt. In trying to \"help\" us, Alicia might very well have ruined everything. What did we do now? I was saved from an immediate decision when a middle-aged woman walked through the door. \"Hello,\" she told Alicia. \"I wanted to get some information about hosting a wedding here. For my niece.\" \"Of course,\" said Alicia, glancing back and forth between all of us. She looked a little flustered over who to help, and I was quick to jump in. \"Hey,\" I said. \"Since we\u0027re here, can we look at the Bunny Suite again? We can\u0027t stop talking about it.\" Alicia frowned. \"I thought you were going to the coast for your anniversary?\" \"We were,\" said Adrian, following my lead. \"But then Taylor was thinking about Cottontail the other night, and we thought we should reconsider.\" I had to give him credit for jumping in and going along with the story I was making up on the spot. Of course, you\u0027d think he\u0027d remember the name of the fake rabbit he had created. \"Hopper,\" I corrected. \"Is the Bunny Suite still vacant?\" he asked. \"We can just take a quick peek in while you help her.\" Alicia hesitated only a moment before handing over a key. \"Sure. Let me know if you have any questions.\" I took the key and headed toward the stairs with Adrian. Behind us, I could hear the woman asking if it\u0027d be okay to set up a tent in the backyard and how many hot plates the inn could hold before it became a fire hazard. Once we were on the second floor and out of earshot, Adrian spoke. \"Let me guess. You want to go prowl through the Velvet Suite.\" I rewarded him with a grin, pleased that he\u0027d guessed my plan. \"Yup. Pretty good idea, huh? Hopefully Alicia will be distracted for a while.\" \"I could have just compelled her,\" he reminded me. \"You\u0027re using too much spirit already.\" I found the Velvet Suite and put the key in the lock, hoping Alicia had given us the master key and not one specifically for the Bunny Suite. When she had shown us around last time, she\u0027d only used one key. A click told me we\u0027d lucked out and wouldn\u0027t have to use any metal-burning chemicals today. We\u0027d seen the Velvet Suite during our last visit, and for the most part, it looked the same. Velvet bedding, velvet-covered furniture, and even velvet-textured wallpaper. Only, this time, the room wasn\u0027t in the pristine and unoccupied state as before. Signs around the room showed recent use. The bed was unmade, and the scent of shampoo from the bathroom indicated a shower not too long ago. \"Alicia might have been wrong about Veronica checking out,\" said Adrian. He opened drawer after drawer and found nothing. In the closet, he discovered high-heeled shoes tucked into a corner and a belt on a hanger - things that might be easily missed with frantic packing. \"Someone left here in a hurry.\" My hopes plummeted. In accidentally revealing our \"surprise,\" Alicia had apparently scared Veronica into skipping out on the room. We found no sign that Veronica would actually return, and as Adrian had said, she seemed to have taken off quickly, based on the kinds of easy-to-forget things that were left behind: a razor in the shower, a bottle of perfume on the bathroom counter, and a stack of takeout menus on the nightstand. I sat on the bed and sifted through the menus, not really convinced they\u0027d tell me much. Chinese, Indian, Mexican. Veronica had diverse tastes, at least. I reached the bottom of the stack and threw them on the ground. \"She left,\" I said. I couldn\u0027t hide from the truth any longer. \"That idiot Alicia tipped her off, and now we\u0027ve lost her again.\" Adrian sat down beside me, his face mirroring my dismay. \"We\u0027ll find her. We\u0027ve slowed her down by hiding the others. Maybe it\u0027ll buy us time until the next full moon so you can scry again.\" \"I hope so,\" I said, though I wasn\u0027t optimistic. He brushed aside the wig\u0027s hair and turned my face toward him. \"Everything\u0027s going to be okay. She doesn\u0027t know about you.\" I knew he was right, but it was hollow comfort. I leaned my head against his shoulder, wishing I could fix everything. That was my job, right? \"All that means is that someone else could suffer in my place. I don\u0027t want that. I need to stop her once and for all.\" \"So brave.\" He gave me a small smile. His fingertips slid down from my face, lightly stroking the line of my neck, down toward my shoulder. Everywhere he touched, a trail of goose bumps appeared. How did he keep doing this to me? Marcus - who made every girl in the world swoon - had zero effect on me. But one whisper of a touch from Adrian completely undid me. \"You could give Castile a run for his money,\" he added. \"Stop that,\" I warned. \"Comparing you to Castile?\" \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m talking about, and you know it.\" His hands were too dangerous, as was being with him on a bed. Terrified I might be kissed again, I jerked away, and the sudden movement caught him by surprise. His fingers got tangled in my hair, as well as in my two necklaces, which resulted in him snapping both chains and nearly pulling off the brown wig. I quickly caught the garnet before it could fall off, but the cross slipped away. Thank God I\u0027d kept the important one on. \"No more kissing,\" I warned. I refastened the charm and straightened the wig. \"You mean no more kissing unless it\u0027s a romantic place,\" he reminded me. \"Are you saying this place doesn\u0027t scream romance?\" He nodded around to our tacky velvet surroundings. He then picked up the small cross and held it in the air, growing thoughtful as he studied the way the light played off the gold surface. \"You gave this to me once.\" \"And you gave it back.\" \"I was angry.\" \"And now?\" He shrugged. \"Now I\u0027m just determined.\" \"Adrian.\" I sighed. \"Why do you keep doing this? The touching . . . the kissing . . . you know I don\u0027t want it.\" \"You don\u0027t act that way.\" \"Stop saying that. It\u0027s obnoxious. Next you\u0027ll be saying I\u0027m \u0027asking for it.\u0027\" Why did he have to be so infuriating? Okay . . . I hadn\u0027t really sent a clear message back at the sorority. Or Pies and Stuff. But this time I\u0027d done better. \"I just pulled away. How much more direct do I have to be?\" \"It\u0027s not your actions, exactly\" he said. He still clutched the cross in his hand. \"It\u0027s your aura.\" I groaned. \"No, no, not that. I don\u0027t want to hear about auras.\" \"But I\u0027m serious.\" He shifted over and stretched out on the bed, lying on his side. He patted the bed near him. \"Lie down.\" \"Adrian - \" \"I won\u0027t kiss you,\" he said. \"I promise.\" \"How stupid do you think I am?\" I said. \"I\u0027m not falling for this.\" He gave me a long, level look. \"Do you really think I\u0027d assault you or something?\" \"No,\" I said quickly. \"Of course not.\" \"Then humor me.\" Warily, I lay down on my side as well, facing him with only a few powerful inches between us. An enraptured, slightly distracted look appeared in his eyes. He\u0027d given himself over to spirit. \"Do you know what I see in you now? The usual aura. A steady golden yellow, healthy and strong, with spikes of purple here and there. But when I do this. . . .\" He rested a hand on my hip, and my whole body tensed up. That hand moved around my hip, slipping under my shirt to rest on the small of my back. My skin burned where he touched me, and the places that were untouched longed for that heat. \"See?\" he said. He was in the throes of spirit now, though with me at the same time. \"Well, I guess you can\u0027t. But when I touch you, your aura . . . it smolders. The colors deepen, it burns more intensely, the purple increases. Why? Why, Sydney?\" He used that hand on me to pull me closer. \"Why do you react that way if I don\u0027t mean anything to you?\" There was a desperation in his voice, and it was legitimate. It was hard for me to talk. \"It\u0027s instinct. Or something. You\u0027re a Moroi. I\u0027m an Alchemist. Of course I\u0027d have a response. You think I\u0027d be indifferent?\" \"Most Alchemist responses would involve disgust, revulsion, and holy water.\" That was an excellent point. \"Well . . . I\u0027m a little more relaxed around Moroi than most Alchemists. Probably this is just some purely physical response driven by hormones and years of evolution. My body doesn\u0027t know any better. I\u0027m as susceptible to lust as anyone else.\" There was probably a book about that or at least an article in Cosmopolitan. The hint of a smile played over his lips. He was fully in tune with me again. \"No, you aren\u0027t. I mean, you are, but not without reason. I know you well enough to realize that now. You\u0027re not the kind of person who\u0027s \u0027susceptible to lust\u0027 without some emotion to back it.\" He moved his hand back to my hip, sliding it down my leg. I shuddered, and his face moved closer to mine. There was so much in his eyes, so much desire and longing. \"See? There it is again. My flame in the dark.\" \"Don\u0027t kiss me,\" I whispered. It was the only defense I could muster. If he kissed me, I\u0027d be lost. I closed my eyes. \"You said you wouldn\u0027t.\" \"I won\u0027t.\" His lips were only a breath away. \"Unless you want me to.\" I opened my eyes, ready to tell him no, that it didn\u0027t matter what my aura allegedly said . . . this couldn\u0027t keep happening. There was no emotion backing this desire, and I tried to cling to my earlier argument. I was so comfortable around Moroi now that clearly some primal part of me kept forgetting what he was. This was a base instinct. I was simply having a physical reaction to him, to his hands, to his lips, to his body. . . . He caught hold of my arm and rolled me over. I closed my eyes again and wrapped my arms around his neck. I felt his lips touch mine, not quite a kiss, just the barest brush of - The door opened, and I flinched. Alicia stepped inside, gasped, and put a hand up over her mouth to cover a shocked squeal. \"O-oh,\" she stammered. \"I\u0027m so sorry . . . I . . . I didn\u0027t realize . . .\" Adrian and I jerked away and sat up. My heart was ready to beat out of my chest, and I knew I was blushing. I quickly patted my wig and was relieved to feel it was still in place. He recovered his voice more quickly. \"Sorry . . . we kind of got carried away. We started checking out the other rooms and decided to, uh, try them out.\" Despite his sheepish words, there was a smug look on his face, the kind you\u0027d expect from a guy who\u0027d just made a conquest. Was it part of the act, or did he really think he\u0027d gotten away with something? Alicia looked as uncomfortable as I felt. \"I see. Well, this room\u0027s occupied. It\u0027s - \" She frowned and did a double take. \"It\u0027s Veronica\u0027s. It looks like she left.\" I finally managed to speak. \"That\u0027s why we thought it was empty,\" I said hastily. \"There was nothing in here.\" Alicia thankfully seemed to have forgotten about our compromising position. \"That\u0027s weird. She didn\u0027t formally check out. I mean, she paid in advance in cash, but still. It\u0027s so strange.\" We made a hurried escape of our own after that, once again feeding Alicia lines about how we\u0027d be in touch. Neither of us spoke much when we got in the car. I was lost in my own thoughts, which were equal parts frustration over Veronica and confusion over Adrian. I refused to acknowledge the latter, though, and opted for my usual tactic. The sooner that moment was forgotten, the better. I was pretty sure I could keep telling myself that. Some part of me - nearly as snarky as Adrian - suggested I pick up a book on denial the next time I was in the self-help section. \"Another dead end,\" I said once we were on the road. I texted Ms. Terwilliger: V\u0027s gone. No need for action. Her response came a few minutes later: We\u0027ll keep trying. I could practically feel her disappointment through the display on my phone. She wasn\u0027t the only one. Adrian seemed particularly melancholy on the drive back. He responded whenever I spoke, but it was clear he was distracted. When he dropped me off at Amberwood later that night, I found everything mercifully quiet. No crises, no dangerous missions. It felt like it had been ages since I had a moment to myself, and I curled up on my bed, taking solace in the ordinary tasks of homework and reading. I fell asleep with my face on my calculus book. I experienced one of those nonsensical dreams that everyone has. In it, my family\u0027s cat could talk, and he was driving Adrian\u0027s Mustang. He asked me if I wanted to take a road trip to Birmingham. I told him I had a lot of homework to do but that if he wanted to go to Fargo, I\u0027d consider it. We were in the middle of negotiating who\u0027d pay for gas when the dream suddenly dissolved to blackness. A cold feeling swept over me, followed by a feeling of dread that rivaled the time Adrian and I had faced down Strigoi in his apartment. A woman\u0027s laughter rolled around me, foul and sickening, like some sort of toxic smoke. A voice came out of the darkness, echoing in my mind. She\u0027s kept you well hidden, but it can\u0027t stay that way forever. You can\u0027t conceal power like yours forever. I\u0027ve caught your trail. I\u0027ll find you. Hands suddenly reached out of the darkness for me, wrapping around my throat and cutting off my air. I screamed and woke up in my own bed, surrounded in books. I\u0027d left the light on, and it chased some of the dream\u0027s terror away. But only some. Sweat poured off me, making my shirt stick to me. I touched my neck, but there was nothing wrong with it. The garnet hung in place but not my cross. No need to fear a dream, I thought. It didn\u0027t mean anything, and really, with everything going on lately, it was a wonder I didn\u0027t have nightmares more often. But thinking back on it, I wasn\u0027t so sure. There had been something so terrible and real about it, a horror that seemed to reach into my very soul. I didn\u0027t want to sleep after that, so I made a cup of coffee and tried to read again. It worked for a while, but somewhere around four, my body couldn\u0027t take it anymore. I fell asleep on my books again, but this time, my sleep stayed dream free.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-15.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
