{"id":109599,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"I THINK ADRIAN WOULD\u0027VE gone hunting Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s sister with me then and there. Amberwood\u0027s curfew wouldn\u0027t allow it, and besides, it was something I wanted to do in daylight. To his credit, he did heal Marcus without them getting into a fistfight, so that was progress. Marcus lost a little of his animosity and tried to engage Adrian in conversation about what spirit could do. Adrian gave wary responses and looked relieved when Sabrina showed up to take Marcus away. He gave me a mysterious farewell, simply saying he\u0027d text me soon about the \"next stage.\" I was too tired to ask for more details and headed back to my dorm to sleep off what had been a pretty crazy day. I was awakened at the crack of dawn by heavy pounding at my door. I squinted at the clock, grimacing when I saw that it was an hour earlier than I usually got up. I stayed in bed, hoping whoever it was would go away. If there was something really urgent happening, someone would\u0027ve called me on my cell phone. The display showed no missed calls, however. Unfortunately, the knocking didn\u0027t stop. With a feeling of dread, I finally dragged myself up, half-afraid of what I\u0027d find outside my door. It was Angeline. \"Finally,\" she said, inviting herself into my room. \"I thought you\u0027d never answer.\" \"Sorry,\" I said, shutting the door behind her. \"I was busy sleeping.\" She walked right up to my bed and sat down like she owned it. I really didn\u0027t know her schedule, but she always struck me as a late riser. Apparently not today. She was dressed in a school uniform, with her brilliant red hair pulled back in what was, for her, a rather tidy ponytail. \"I have a problem,\" she said. My feeling of dread grew. I turned on my coffeemaker, which I always had ready with fresh grounds and water. Something told me I was going to need a cup to get through this. \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked, settling into my desk chair. I made no attempt at even guessing. When it came to Angeline, her problems could range from throwing a desk in rage or accidentally spilling hydrochloric acid on another student. Both had happened recently. \"I\u0027m failing math,\" she said. This was unwelcome but not unexpected news. Angeline\u0027s mountain community, while still educating its children, didn\u0027t quite match the standards of Amberwood\u0027s elite curriculum. She struggled in a number of her classes but had managed to scrape by so far. \"I\u0027m already in trouble in my Spanish class,\" she added. \"But that pinata I made got me some extra credit, so I\u0027m hanging in there okay for now.\" I\u0027d heard about the pinata. It had been for her class\u0027s cultural day, and she\u0027d been so thorough with her papier-mache that none of her classmates had been able to open it through normal means. Angeline had ended up beating it against a wall and had to be stopped by her teacher when she\u0027d produced a lighter. \"But if I slip there and in math, I could get expelled.\" That dragged me away from the flammable pinata and back to the present. \"Ugh,\" I said, having no better way to articulate my thoughts. The problem with a school that had high standards was . . . well, it had high standards. Trouble in one class might be tolerated, but not two. And if Angeline got kicked out, we\u0027d be down one level of security for Jill - not to mention the fact that I\u0027d probably get blamed for it all. \"Ms. Hayward told me I need to get a tutor. She says I either need to get better or at least show I\u0027m trying.\" That was promising, I supposed. Even if a tutor couldn\u0027t help, hopefully the school would be lenient with her good faith effort. \"Okay,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll get you a tutor.\" She frowned. \"Why can\u0027t you do it? You\u0027re smart. You\u0027re good at math.\" Why couldn\u0027t I? Well, first I had to stop an evil sorceress from sucking the youth and power from innocent girls. Then I had to crack the secrets and lies that the organization I\u0027d been born into was telling me. Instead I said, \"I\u0027m busy.\" \"You have to do it. It\u0027d be easy for you,\" she protested. \"Really busy,\" I said. \"I\u0027m surprised Eddie can\u0027t do it.\" His name brought a smile to her face. \"He offered, but his grades are just average. I need someone really good.\" \"Then I\u0027ll get you someone really good. I just can\u0027t do it myself right now.\" Angeline didn\u0027t like that answer, but at least she didn\u0027t flip over my desk. \"Okay. Fine. Just hurry up.\" \"Yes, your majesty,\" I muttered, watching her strut out of my room in a huff. At least Angeline\u0027s academic problems were something a little easier to deal with than the other supernatural intrigues occupying my time. Since I was already awake and had coffee, I decided there was no point in going back to sleep. I showered and dressed, then caught up on some extra homework while I waited for breakfast. When the serving time started in our cafeteria, I headed downstairs and lingered near the entrance. It only took about five minutes before my friend Kristin Sawyer came by. She always went running before class started and was usually one of the first in line for breakfast afterward. She was also in AP calculus with me. \"Hey,\" I said, falling in step with her. \"Good run?\" \"Great run,\" she said. There was still a little sweat on her dark skin. \"A lot nicer now that the weather\u0027s cooler.\" She eyed me curiously. \"I don\u0027t usually see you here this early. I don\u0027t usually see you eat breakfast.\" \"It\u0027s the most important meal of the day, right?\" I selected oatmeal and an apple. \"Besides, I have a favor to ask you.\" Kristin nearly dropped the plate of scrambled eggs one of the servers handed to her. Her brown eyes widened. \"You have a favor to ask me?\" While I wasn\u0027t responsible for my human friends in the same way I was the Moroi and dhampirs, I still had a tendency to look after them. I\u0027d helped Kristin a number of times. \"Yeah . . . my cousin Angeline needs a math tutor.\" There was an expectant look on Kristin\u0027s face, like she was waiting for me to finish my story. Then understanding hit. \"Who, me? No. No way.\" \"Oh, come on. It\u0027d be easy.\" I followed her to a table, having to hurry to catch up. I think she thought that if she walked quickly enough, she might be able to escape my request. \"She\u0027s in remedial math. You could tutor her in your sleep.\" Kristin sat down and gave me a long, level look. \"Sydney, I saw your cousin punch a grown man and throw a speaker at someone. Do you really think I\u0027m going to sign on for a job that makes her do work she doesn\u0027t want to do? What if she gets frustrated at what I\u0027m telling her? How do I know she won\u0027t stab me with a compass?\" \"You don\u0027t,\" I admitted. \"But I think it\u0027s unlikely. Probably. She really wants to improve her grade. Otherwise, she could get kicked out.\" \"Sorry.\" Kristin actually did look legitimately apologetic. \"You know I\u0027d do almost anything for you - but not this. You\u0027re going to have to find someone who\u0027s not afraid of her.\" I thought about her words over and over as I headed off to history class. She was right. But the only people completely at ease around her were Eddie and Jill, and they were off the list as tutors. I wondered if maybe I should offer up money to someone when I went to calculus later. \"Miss Melbourne.\" Ms. Terwilliger was back in her classroom, no doubt to the relief of yesterday\u0027s sub. She waved me up to her messy desk and handed me a single sheet of paper. \"Here\u0027s the list we discussed.\" I scanned it. It contained the names of six girls as well as their addresses. These must be the ones she\u0027d mentioned, girls with known magical aptitude but no coven or teacher to look out for them. All the addresses were in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. \"I trust Mrs. Santos got you the other information you needed for your project?\" \"Yes.\" Mrs. Santos had emailed me the historical neighborhoods she knew about, and I\u0027d narrowed them down to a couple likely candidates. \"I\u0027ll start working on the, uh, project this weekend.\" Ms. Terwilliger arched an eyebrow. \"Why are you putting it off? I\u0027ve never known you to procrastinate on an assignment.\" I was a little startled. \"Well . . . normally I don\u0027t, ma\u0027am. But this is going to take some extra time - travel time - and I don\u0027t have enough of it on school days.\" \"Ah,\" she said, realization hitting her. \"Well, then, you may use your independent study for it. That\u0027ll give you extra time. And I\u0027ll tell Mrs. Weathers you may be coming in after curfew. I\u0027ll make sure that she\u0027s accommodating. This project is of the utmost importance.\" There was no protest I could make. \"I\u0027ll start today, then.\" As I was walking back to my desk, a voice said, \"Jeez, Melbourne. Just when I thought that independent study you had with her couldn\u0027t get any easier . . . now you don\u0027t even have to show up for class?\" I paused to give Trey a smile. He was Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s assistant during this class period, meaning he did a lot of filing and photocopying. \"It\u0027s a very important assignment,\" I said. \"I guess. What is it?\" \"It\u0027d bore you.\" I did a double take as I looked him over. I didn\u0027t even have to grope for a change in conversation. \"What happened to you?\" His eyes were bloodshot, and the unkempt state of his black hair suggested he hadn\u0027t had a shower this morning. There was a sallow, almost sickly hue to his normally tan skin. He gave me a weak smile and lowered his voice. \"Craig Lo\u0027s brother scored us some beer last night. It was from some microbrewery I guess that\u0027s good.\" I groaned. \"Trey, I thought you were better than that.\" Trey managed as much of an indignant look as he could in his hungover state. \"Hey, some of us like to have a little fun now and then. You should give it a shot sometime. I already tried to help you with Brayden, but you messed that up.\" \"I didn\u0027t mess anything up!\" Brayden was a barista who worked with Trey, one who rivaled me when it came to a love of academia and random knowledge. Our brief relationship had been full of facts and low on passion. \"He broke up with me.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t guess it. Did you know he writes all this lovesick poetry about you on his breaks?\" I was taken aback. \"He . . . he does?\" The reason Brayden had broken up with me was because my various duties to my vampire family had constantly interfered with the two of us, forcing me to neglect him and cancel a lot. \"I feel kind of bad he took it that hard. I\u0027m surprised he\u0027d have such a, I don\u0027t know, outburst of passion.\" Trey snorted. \"I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s that passionate. He\u0027s more concerned about form and sits around with books detailing iambic pentameter and sonnet analysis.\" \"Okay, that sounds more like him.\" The bell was about to ring, so I had started to return to my seat when I noticed something on Trey\u0027s desk. \"You\u0027re not done with that?\" It was a big homework assignment we had for our chemistry class, involving a number of complicated acid and base problems. It was due in our next period, and it seemed unlikely Trey would finish in time since all he had on the paper so far was his name. \"Yeah . . . I was going to finish it last night, but . . .\" \"Right. The beer. Having fun.\" I didn\u0027t even bother to hide my disapproval. \"That\u0027s a huge part of our grade.\" \"I know, I know.\" He looked down at the papers with a sigh. \"I\u0027ll finish as much as I can before then. Partial credit\u0027s better than no credit.\" I studied him for a moment and then made a decision that went against many of my basic principles. I reached into my messenger bag and handed him my completed homework. \"Here,\" I said. He took the pages with a frown. \"Here what?\" \"It\u0027s the assignment. Use my answers.\" \"I. . . .\" His jaw dropped. \"Do you know what you\u0027re doing?\" \"Yes.\" \"I don\u0027t think you do. You\u0027re giving me your homework.\" \"Yes.\" \"And telling me to pass it off as my homework.\" \"Yes.\" \"But I didn\u0027t actually do the work.\" \"Do you want them or not?\" I asked in frustration. I started to take the papers back, but he pulled them close. \"Oh, I want them,\" he said. \"I just want to know what you want in return. Because this doesn\u0027t really make up for getting me ostracized from my family and friends.\" He kept his tone light, but I heard the edge of bitterness. There it was. No matter how friendly he and I were, our respective allegiances to the Warriors and the Alchemists would always be between us. Maybe it was a joke now . . . but someday it wouldn\u0027t be. \"I need a favor,\" I explained. \"A small one, really. Has nothing to do with any of that . . . stuff.\" Trey looked understandably wary. \"Which is?\" The bell rang, so I spoke quickly. \"Angeline needs a math tutor or else she\u0027ll fail. And if she fails, she\u0027ll get kicked out of school. It wouldn\u0027t be hard for you at all. And it\u0027d look good on your college applications.\" \"Your cousin\u0027s a little unstable,\" he said. But he didn\u0027t say no, so I thought that was a good sign. \"You used to think she was hot,\" I reminded him. \"Yeah, that was before. . . .\" He didn\u0027t finish, but I knew. Before he found out she was a dhampir. The Warriors had the same taboos the Alchemists did about relationships between the races. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I understand. I\u0027ll just take my homework and go.\" I held out my hand, but he didn\u0027t give the papers back. \"Wait, I\u0027ll do it. But if she injures me, I hope you\u0027ll feel really bad. Basketball season just started, and the team will fall apart if I\u0027m sidelined because of her.\" I grinned. \"I\u0027ll be devastated.\" Angeline was not so thrilled when I told her at lunch. She flushed with rage and looked like she was about ready to throw her tray across the cafeteria. \"You expect me to work with that . . . that . . . vampire hunter?\" she demanded. I wondered if she\u0027d had another name in mind but had held back in some remarkable show of restraint. \"Especially after what they tried to do to Sonya?\" \"Trey\u0027s not like the rest of them,\" I said defensively. \"He refused to kill her and even went through the trouble of getting me in to help her - which ended up severely messing up his life, I might add.\" Eddie looked amused, despite the grim subject. \"You should also add that he wants very, very badly to get back to that old life.\" I pointed at Eddie with my fork. \"Don\u0027t tell me you think Trey\u0027s a bad choice too.\" \"For tutoring?\" He shook his head. \"Nah, he\u0027s fine. I\u0027m just saying you shouldn\u0027t be so quick to assume everything\u0027s happy and bright with him. It seems pretty likely his group\u0027s working against us.\" \"He\u0027s my friend,\" I said, hoping my firm tone would put an end to the discussion. After a few more assurances, Eddie convinced Angeline to work with Trey, reminding her she needed to keep her grades up. Still, Eddie\u0027s words haunted me. I believed absolutely that Trey was my friend but again wondered when that rift between us would rear its ugly head. When Eddie and Angeline left to go to their afternoon classes, I asked Jill to hang back at the table for a minute. \"What\u0027s Adrian doing right now?\" \"He\u0027s in his painting class,\" she said promptly. \"The bond must be running strong today, huh?\" I asked. Sometimes her view of his mind and experiences was clearer than others. She shrugged. \"No, but it\u0027s eleven on Tuesday.\" \"Right,\" I said, feeling foolish. I knew everyone\u0027s schedules; it was necessary for my job. \"I should\u0027ve realized that. Do you think he\u0027d be able to meet up with me after school?\" \"To go on that witch hunt? Yeah, he\u0027d probably leave right now.\" Jill knew what Adrian knew, so she\u0027d also been briefed about my search for Veronica. While I\u0027d learned to accept Jill\u0027s knowledge as part of confiding in Adrian, it was still a little shocking for me to hear these forbidden topics discussed openly. Seeing my stunned reaction, Jill smiled a little. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" she said. \"I keep Adrian\u0027s secrets. And yours.\" The bitterness in her voice also caught me off guard. \"Are you mad at me?\" I asked, puzzled. \"You\u0027re not . . . you\u0027re not still upset about what happened between Adrian and me, are you? I thought you\u0027d eased up on that.\" Although Adrian\u0027s proclamation of loving me against the odds had been unsettling, his more relaxed attitude had come through in her until now. \"Adrian has,\" she said. \"He doesn\u0027t see the danger of you running around with another guy.\" I was lost. \"Another guy? You don\u0027t mean . . . Marcus? That\u0027s crazy.\" \"Is it?\" asked Jill. The bond was so strange at times. Jill was jealous on Adrian\u0027s behalf. \"He\u0027s human, you\u0027re human. You\u0027ve both got this rebel Alchemist thing going on. And I saw him. He\u0027s pretty cute. There\u0027s no telling what could happen.\" \"Well, I know what could happen: nothing,\" I said. Even through a psychic bond, Marcus could win over girls. \"I just met him. I don\u0027t even know if I can entirely trust him, and I certainly don\u0027t have any feelings for him. Look, I get that you want to help Adrian, but you can\u0027t be mad at me about what happened. You know why I turned him down - especially after Micah.\" Micah was Eddie\u0027s human roommate, and even though she knew human-vampire relationships couldn\u0027t get serious, she\u0027d still been surprised at just how complex and difficult the situation had been. \"Yeah. . . .\" She frowned, no doubt conflicted over Adrian\u0027s feelings and what she knew was true. \"But maybe with Adrian, I don\u0027t know. Maybe things could be different. Or maybe there\u0027s at least a way to make them less painful for him.\" I looked away, unable to meet her eyes. I didn\u0027t like to think of Adrian in pain, but what else could I do? What did either of them expect me to do? We all knew the rules. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, picking up my tray and standing. \"I never asked for any of this. Adrian will get over me.\" \"Do you really want him to get over you?\" she asked. \"What? Why would you even ask something like that?\" She didn\u0027t answer and instead made a great show of stirring around her mashed potatoes. When I realized she wasn\u0027t going to elaborate, I shook my head and walked off toward the exit. All the while, I could feel her watching me as that question echoed in my mind: Do you really want him to get over you?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-8.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
