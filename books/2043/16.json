{"id":109606,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"I GAVE MS. TERWILLIGER a full report on our trip to the inn the next morning. We met at Spencer\u0027s, and in a rare show of early rising, Adrian joined us. \"I\u0027ve got a study group meeting soon,\" he explained. His mood was a lot better, with no mention of yesterday\u0027s . . . indiscretion.\\n\\n Even though there wasn\u0027t much to tell, lines of worry creased her face as she heard our story. The true panic came when I mentioned my dream. Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s eyes went wide, and she gripped her coffee cup so tightly, I thought it would break.\\n\\n \"She found out,\" she murmured. \"Whether it was that Alicia girl or some other way, Veronica found out about you. I should never have sent you. I thought you\u0027d slip underneath her radar if the other girls were charmed, but I was wrong. I was selfish and naive. It would\u0027ve been better if she knew I was on to her from the very beginning. You\u0027re sure you were masking Sydney\u0027s appearance?\" That was to Adrian.\\n\\n \"Positive,\" he said. \"Everyone we talked to, all the girls and even Alicia . . . none of them would have a clear idea of what Sydney looks like.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe she\u0027s been spying on you,\" I suggested. \"And saw us together. I haven\u0027t been in disguise around here.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" Ms. Terwilliger conceded. \"But we also know she was active in Los Angeles. She would have to spend considerable time stalking her victims, which wouldn\u0027t give her the chance to come here and watch me extensively. Even with her powers, she can\u0027t teleport.\" Her expression hardened with resolve. \"Well, there\u0027s nothing to be done now but damage control. She doesn\u0027t seem to know exactly where you are yet or that you\u0027re even connected to me. I\u0027ll make you another charm to try to boost this one, but it may not work if she\u0027s found a way to reach out to you. And in the meantime, don\u0027t worry about offense anymore. You need to focus on defense - particularly invisibility spells. Your best protection against Veronica at this point is for her simply not to find you if she comes looking around Palm Springs.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d continued reading the advanced offense spells, despite her warnings. With this new development, though, I knew she was right about defense being more important. Still, I couldn\u0027t shake the worry that Veronica had discovered me by watching Ms. Terwilliger, which in turn made me fear for my teacher\u0027s safety. \"You keep saying she\u0027s not after you . . . but are you really sure?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll avoid me if she can,\" said Ms. Terwilliger, sounding confident. \"I have the power but not the youth and beauty she\u0027s after. And even she would draw the line at taking on her sister. It\u0027s the only remnant of human decency she has left.\"\\n\\n \"Will she still have that attitude when you confront her?\" asked Adrian.\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger shook her head. \"No. Then anything goes. I\u0027d like to meet with you tonight to practice a couple other defensive tactics.\"\\n\\n I eyed her carefully. \"Are you up for that? No offense, ma\u0027am, but you already look exhausted.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be fine. Meet me at the park again around ten. I\u0027ll get Weathers to let you go. We must keep you safe.\" She stared off into space for several moments and then focused on me again. \"In light of this development . . . it wouldn\u0027t be a bad idea for you to find some, ah, more basic means of defense as well.\"\\n\\n \"Basic?\" I asked, puzzled.\\n\\n \"She means like a gun or a knife,\" supplied Adrian, catching on to what I hadn\u0027t.\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger nodded. \"If you ever confront Veronica, it\u0027ll most likely come down to magic fighting magic . . . but, well, one can never say. Having something else for backup might prove invaluable.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t a fan of this idea. \"I have no clue how to knife fight. And I don\u0027t like guns.\"\\n\\n \"Do you like being put into a coma and aging before your time?\" asked Adrian.\\n\\n I shot him a glare, surprised he\u0027d be on board with this. \"Of course not. But where would we even get one on such short notice?\"\\n\\n From the look on his face, he knew I had a point. Suddenly, he became enthusiastic again. \"I think I know.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you two will figure it out,\" said Ms. Terwilliger, her mind already moving to something else. She glanced at her watch. \"Almost time for classes.\"\\n\\n We all stood up, preparing to go our own ways, but I held Adrian back. I couldn\u0027t imagine how in the world he would know where to get a gun on no notice. He wouldn\u0027t elaborate and simply said he\u0027d meet me after school. Before he left, I remembered something I\u0027d wanted to ask.\\n\\n \"Adrian, did you keep my cross?\"\\n\\n \"Your - oh.\" Looking into his eyes, I could practically see yesterday\u0027s events playing through his mind - including us rolling around on the bed. \"I dropped it when - ah, well, before we left. Yo u didn\u0027t pick it up?\"\\n\\n I shook my head, and his face fell.\\n\\n \"Shit, I\u0027m sorry, Sage.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said automatically.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not okay, and it\u0027s my fault. I know how much it means to you.\"\\n\\n It did mean a lot to me, but I almost blamed myself as much as him. I should\u0027ve thought of it before we left, but I\u0027d been a little preoccupied. \"It\u0027s just a necklace,\" I told him.\\n\\n This didn\u0027t comfort him. He looked so dejected when we parted ways that I hoped he wouldn\u0027t forget about us meeting up later to visit his mysterious gun source. There was nothing to worry about, though. When classes ended, he was outside my dorm in the Mustang and looked much more upbeat, with no more mention of the necklace.\\n\\n When he told me his gun plan, I was shocked, but after a few moments of thought, I realized he might be on to something. And so, a little less than an hour later, we found ourselves far outside the city, driving up to a forlorn-looking home on a large, barren piece of land. We had reached the Wolfe School of Defense.\\n\\n \"I never thought we\u0027d be here again,\" I remarked.\\n\\n Wolfe\u0027s house had no windows, and there were no cars in sight as we walked up to the door. \"He may not even be home,\" I murmured to Adrian. \"We probably should have called first.\"\\n\\n \"Wolfe never struck me as a guy who leaves the house very much,\" said Adrian. He knocked on the door, and almost instantly, we heard a flurry of barking and scampering feet. I grimaced. Wolfe, for reasons I would never be able to understand, kept a herd of Chihuahuas in his house. He\u0027d once told us that they could kill a man upon a single command.\\n\\n We waited a few minutes, but the barking was the only sign that there was any sort of life inside. Adrian knocked one more time (driving the dogs into an even greater frenzy) and then shrugged. \"I guess you were - \"\\n\\n The door suddenly opened - just a slit - and one gray eye peered out at us from underneath a chain. \"Oh,\" came a grizzled voice. \"It\u0027s you two.\"\\n\\n The door closed, and I heard the chain being unlocked. A moment later, Wolfe slipped outside, careful not to let any of the dogs out. He had a patch over his left eye, which was probably just as well since his other eye alone seemed to peer straight through me. \"You should\u0027ve called,\" he said. \"I nearly turned the dogs on you.\"\\n\\n Wolfe was dressed in his favorite pair of Bermuda shorts as well as a T-shirt showing a bald eagle riding on a monster truck. The eagle held an American flag in one set of talons and a samurai sword in the other. That seemed a weird weapon choice for such a patriotic shirt, but we\u0027d long since learned not to question his wardrobe. That had come after he\u0027d kicked a woman out of our class who\u0027d dared to ask if he only had one pair of shorts or several identical ones.\\n\\n \"What do you kids need?\" he asked. \"Next classes don\u0027t start until after New Year\u0027s.\"\\n\\n Adrian and I exchanged glances. \"We, um, need a gun,\" I said. \"I mean, just to borrow.\"\\n\\n Wolfe scratched his beard. \"I don\u0027t lend them out to students who haven\u0027t taken my gun class. Safety first.\" I found it promising, however, that he lent out guns at all. It was a sign of his character that he didn\u0027t even bother asking why we wanted one.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve already had training,\" I said. That was true. It was mandatory for all Alchemists. I\u0027d done well in it, but as I\u0027d mentioned to Adrian, I really didn\u0027t like guns at all. At least a knife had other uses. But a gun? It was only there to injure or kill.\\n\\n Wolfe arched an eyebrow, the one over his good eye. Clearly, he didn\u0027t believe me. \"Can you back that up?\"\\n\\n \"Do you have a shooting range?\" I returned coolly.\\n\\n He almost looked offended. \"Of course I do.\"\\n\\n He led us to a building beyond the garage we\u0027d trained in. I\u0027d never been inside this building before, but like his house, it had no windows. The door was covered in enough locks to meet with Alchemist security standards. He let us inside, and I gaped when I saw not only a practice range but also a wall covered in various types of guns. Wolfe gave the small holding space a once-over.\\n\\n \"Earmuffs must be in the house. Be right back.\"\\n\\n I continued staring at the wall, knowing my eyes were wide. \"There\u0027s no way those are all legal.\"\\n\\n Adrian\u0027s response was unexpected. \"Did you notice his eye patch?\"\\n\\n I dragged my gaze from the arsenal. \"Um, yes. From the day we first met him.\"\\n\\n \"No, no. I mean, I swear it was on his other eye last time.\"\\n\\n \"It was not,\" I said immediately.\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" asked Adrian.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t, I realized. Words and numbers were easy for me to memorize. But other details, like clothing or hair - or eye patches - were sometimes easy for me to miss. \"That doesn\u0027t make any sense,\" I finally said. \"Why would he do that?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s Malachi Wolfe,\" said Adrian. \"Why wouldn\u0027t he do that?\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t argue against that.\\n\\n Wolfe returned with ear protection. After examining his wall, he selected a small handgun and then unlocked a cabinet containing ammunition. At least he didn\u0027t leave a bunch of loaded guns around.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do that,\" I told him. I took the gun from him and effortlessly loaded it. He made a small grunt of approval. He gestured toward the far end of the range, to a large paper cutout showing a human silhouette with various targets marked on it.\\n\\n \"Now then,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t worry about hitting the - \"\\n\\n I fired, perfectly emptying the clip into the most difficult targets. I handed the gun to him. He handed it back. Behind him, I could see Adrian staring at me with enormous eyes.\\n\\n \"Keep it,\" said Wolfe. \"You passed. You\u0027ve gotta buy your own ammunition, but as long as you fill out the rental agreement, you\u0027re good to go.\"\\n\\n As it turned out, the \"rental agreement\" was a piece of paper where he wrote the gun type on one side and I put my initials on the other. \"Really?\" I asked. \"That\u0027s all I need to do? I mean, I\u0027m glad, but . . .\" I didn\u0027t really know what else to say.\\n\\n Wolfe waved off my protests. \"You\u0027re a good kid. If you say you need a gun, I believe you. Someone giving you trouble?\"\\n\\n I slipped the gun into my messenger bag. \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n Wolfe glanced over at Adrian. \"What about you? You need a gun too?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m good,\" said Adrian. \"Besides, I haven\u0027t had the training. Safety first.\"\\n\\n Wolfe opened up the ammunition cabinet again and produced a long wooden tube and a sandwich bag of what looked like small darts. \"You want to borrow my blowgun? Not much of a learning curve on this. I mean, you\u0027ll never be able to match the skill and cunning of the Amazonian warriors that I stole this from, but it can get you out of a pinch.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, but I\u0027ll take my chances,\" Adrian said after several long moments. He almost sounded as though he\u0027d considered it.\\n\\n I was still hung up on Wolfe\u0027s other words, not sure I believed what I\u0027d heard. \"You were in the Amazon?\"\\n\\n This time, Wolfe arched the eyebrow above his eye patch. \"You don\u0027t believe me?\"\\n\\n \"No, no, of course I do,\" I said quickly. \"It\u0027s just, you\u0027ve never mentioned it before.\"\\n\\n Wolfe gazed off beyond us. \"I\u0027ve been trying for years to forget my time there. But some things, you just can\u0027t escape.\"\\n\\n A very long and very uncomfortable silence followed. At last, I cleared my throat. \"Well, thank you, sir. We should get going. Hopefully I won\u0027t need the gun for very long.\"\\n\\n \"Keep it as long as you need,\" he said. \"If I want it back, I\u0027ll find you.\"\\n\\n And on that disturbing note, Adrian and I left. Although I understood Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s reasons for \"old-fashioned\" defense, I was in no way comfortable having a gun around. I\u0027d have to keep it in my car in case school authorities ever did a search of my room and discovered it. My Alchemist and magical kits were already a liability. I was pretty sure there\u0027d be no talking my way out of a gun.\\n\\n Adrian returned me to Amberwood. I started to open the door and then paused to glance over at him. \"Thanks,\" I said. \"For everything. Going to the inn. Suggesting we see Wolfe.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, that was worth it just to know Wolfe owns a blowgun.\"\\n\\n I laughed. \"Actually, I\u0027d be more surprised if he didn\u0027t. See you later.\"\\n\\n Adrian nodded. \"Sooner than you think.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that mean?\" I asked, suspicion rearing up in me.\\n\\n He dodged the question and reached underneath his seat. \"I called Alicia,\" he told me, producing a small box. \"She couldn\u0027t find your cross. Her housekeeping service had already gone through and cleaned the room, but she says she\u0027ll check to see if it got caught up in the bedding. Oh, and I also asked about Veronica. She hasn\u0027t been back.\"\\n\\n That was disheartening news, but I was touched he\u0027d called. \"Thanks for trying.\"\\n\\n He opened the box and pulled out a necklace with a tiny wooden cross on it. \"I got you a replacement. I mean, I know there\u0027s no real substitute, but I wanted to get you something. And don\u0027t start about not being able to accept some fancy gift,\" he said, guessing the protest I was about to make. \"It cost me five dollars from a street vendor, and I\u0027m pretty sure the chain is brass.\"\\n\\n I bit off my words and took the necklace from him. The cross barely weighed anything. Studying it more closely, I could see a tiny pattern of silver flowers painted on its surface. \"The vendor didn\u0027t do that. That\u0027s your handiwork.\"\\n\\n \"Well . . . I know you\u0027re into simple stuff, but I\u0027ve always got to have some embellishment.\"\\n\\n I ran my finger over the cross\u0027s surface. \"Why\u0027d you choose morning glories?\"\\n\\n \"Because I\u0027m not the biggest fan of lilies.\"\\n\\n I smiled at that.\\n\\n When I returned to my dorm room, I laid the necklace out on my dresser. I gave it one last fond look and then tried to decide how best to spend the rest of my day. Our trip to Wolfe actually hadn\u0027t taken that long, so I had plenty of time to catch dinner and make sure I was up to date on my homework. I actually ate with Kristin and Julia for a change, which was kind of a nice break from the drama of my other friends. Of course, most of the meal consisted of Julia gushing about \"Dave.\" By the end, both she and Kristin were demanding to know when I\u0027d bring him by again.\\n\\n As the evening pushed on, I began to prepare for my meeting with Ms. Terwilliger. I wasn\u0027t sure what kind of magic we\u0027d be practicing outdoors but figured I should be ready for anything. I packed a wide variety of items from my kit and even had the foresight to bring a granola bar for post-magic fuel. Once everything was in order, I headed back downstairs. I was nearly out the dorm door when Mrs. Weathers called out to me.\\n\\n \"Sydney?\"\\n\\n I paused to glance back. \"Yes, ma\u0027am?\"\\n\\n \"Where are you going? It\u0027s nearly curfew.\"\\n\\n Frowning, I walked over to her desk. \"I\u0027m doing an assignment for Ms. Terwilliger.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Weathers looked troubled. \"Yes, I know you do that a lot for her . . . but I haven\u0027t received authorization from her to let you out after hours today.\" Her expression turned apologetic. \"I\u0027m sure this is all on the up-and-up, but, well, rules are rules.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" I said. \"But she said she\u0027d let you know. Are you sure you didn\u0027t get anything? A note? A phone call?\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"Nothing. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"I understand,\" I murmured, though I wasn\u0027t sure I did. Despite her perpetually scattered nature, Ms. Terwilliger was usually good about this sort of thing. Mrs. Weathers assured me she\u0027d let me go if Ms. Terwilliger gave the okay by phone, so I returned to my room and attempted to call her. I went straight to voice mail, and my text went unanswered. Had something happened to her? Had that magical confrontation I\u0027d been dreading finally gone down?\\n\\n I kicked around my dorm room for the next hour or so, letting all my worries eat at me. Veronica. Marcus. St. Louis. Ms. Terwilliger. The dream. Over and over, I kept imagining the worst outcome for all of them. Just when I thought I\u0027d go crazy, Ms. Terwilliger finally returned my call.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you show up?\" she asked as soon as I answered. I felt relieved. She\u0027d gone to the park. That explained the lack of contact since there was no signal out there.\\n\\n \"I tried! Mrs. Weathers wouldn\u0027t let me out. You forgot to give me permission.\"\\n\\n \"I most certainly didn\u0027t. . . .\" Her words trailed off uncertainly. \"That is, I thought I did. . . .\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay\" I said. \"You\u0027ve had a lot on your mind.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not okay.\" She sounded angry but it was at herself, not me. \"I need to be on top of this.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you can call Mrs. Weathers now,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Too late. I\u0027m already back home. We\u0027ll have to attempt this again another time.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"I tried.\"\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger sighed. \"I know you did. It\u0027s not your fault. It\u0027s mine. I\u0027m letting all of this wear me down, and now I\u0027m getting sloppy. I\u0027ve already taken too many risks at your expense, and it\u0027s put Veronica on your trail. I can\u0027t let her get any farther.\"\\n\\n A chill ran through me as I thought of those comatose girls - and the possibility of me joining them. I\u0027d been able to stay cool and collected while investigating, but last night\u0027s dream had driven home the dangers I faced. That image of the girl in the newspaper hovered in my mind as I held the phone and paced my room. I stopped in front of a mirror and tried to picture myself like that, aged before my time. I squeezed my eyes shut and turned away. I couldn\u0027t let that happen to me. I just couldn\u0027t, and I needed Ms. Terwilliger if I was going to stay safe. Maybe I was a prodigy, but I was nowhere near being able to take on someone like her sister.\\n\\n \"Get some rest, ma\u0027am,\" I said at last. \"You sound like you need it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try. And you be careful, Miss Melbourne.\"\\n\\n \"I will.\"\\n\\n Being careful was the only thing I could do on my own for now. I just hoped it would be enough.\\n\\n When we got off the phone, I didn\u0027t want to sleep again. I was afraid to, and it wasn\u0027t just because of the sheer terror I\u0027d felt in last night\u0027s dream. Ms. Terwilliger had explained there was a type of searching spell that sought people in their sleep, and I worried that if Veronica reached out to me again, she might get a fix on my location. The problem was that after last night\u0027s sketchy sleep, I was now even more exhausted. My usual coffee and distraction tricks failed, and before I knew it, I was asleep.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how much time passed before I dreamed. One moment I was lost in the oblivion of sleep. The next, I found myself standing in the room that had hosted Sonya and Mikhail\u0027s reception. It looked exactly the same: flowers everywhere, tables covered in white linen and crystal glasses . . . The only difference was that the room was empty and silent. It was eerie, seeing all that richness and glamour with no one to enjoy it. I could\u0027ve been in a ghost town. I looked down and saw that I wore the same dress from that evening as well.\\n\\n \"I could\u0027ve made it red, you know. That\u0027s a better color for you - not that blue looks bad on you.\"\\n\\n Adrian strode toward me, dressed in the same dark blue suit. Understanding hit me. I was in a spirit dream. It was another of that element\u0027s incredible feats, the ability for a spirit user to intrude on someone\u0027s dreams. No - not intrude. The user was actually able to create the dream itself, controlling every detail.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been a long time since you pulled me into one of these,\" I said.\\n\\n \"And look at the progress you\u0027ve made. Last time you were kicking and screaming.\" He held out a hand. \"Want to dance?\"\\n\\n \"No music,\" I said, not that I had any intention of dancing. He had a point about my reaction, though. I hadn\u0027t exactly been kicking and screaming, but I had kind of freaked out. I\u0027d been in full possession of all my fears about vampires and magic, and being surrounded in a world completely constructed of that magic had left me frightened and unhinged. And now? Now I had apparently become so comfortable that my biggest concern was that he\u0027d put me in this dress. I gestured to it.\\n\\n \"Can you change me out of this?\"\\n\\n \"You can change yourself out of it,\" he said. \"I\u0027m letting go of the control. Just picture yourself the way you are in reality.\"\\n\\n I did exactly that, and a moment later, I wore jeans and a pale blue knit top. This obviously disappointed him. \"That\u0027s what you sleep in?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I laughed. \"I was trying not to sleep at all. It didn\u0027t work. Why\u0027d you bring me here?\"\\n\\n He strolled around and picked up one of the crystal goblets, nodding in approval as though he were some sort of glassmaking expert. \"Exactly that reason. I saw how much that dream bothered you. I figured if I pulled you into one of these, it\u0027d keep you from one of Veronica\u0027s.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d never thought of that. Vampire magic was certainly preferable to hers. Looking around, I gained a new appreciation for the room. It became a sanctuary, a place where she couldn\u0027t reach me. At least, I hoped not. We really didn\u0027t know how her magic would work against Adrian\u0027s. For all I knew, she might come walking through the door, carrying Sonya\u0027s bouquet.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I said. I sat down at one of the tables. \"That was nice of you.\" It was another one of those incredible moments when Adrian had had the insight to guess my thoughts - or in this case, my fears.\\n\\n \"Well, it was also selfish. I wanted to see you in the dress.\" He reconsidered. \"Actually, I wanted to see you in that red Halloween dress again, but I figured that would be pushing my luck.\"\\n\\n I looked away as an image of that dress returned to me. Lia DiStefano had created the costume for me. She\u0027d loosely based it on an ancient Greek dress and ended up with a gauzy confection of red and gold. That was when Adrian had said I was the most beautiful creature walking the earth. It had happened before he expressed his feelings for me, but even then, his words had undone me. I thought about what he was doing for me now and decided to give him a small compensation. I focused again on my clothes, and the blue dress returned.\\n\\n \"Better?\" I asked.\\n\\n His face lit up in a way that made me smile in return. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n Hoping I wasn\u0027t setting myself up for some suggestive answer, I asked, \"So what are we going to do?\"\\n\\n \"You sure you don\u0027t want to dance? I can make some music.\" My silence spoke for me. \"Fine, fine. I don\u0027t know. We could play a game. Monopoly? Life? Battleship? Twister? Whatever we do, I am not playing Scrabble with you.\"\\n\\n We warmed up with Battleship - I won - and then moved on to Monopoly. That took a little work to set up because Adrian could only create things that he could imagine. He couldn\u0027t remember all the streets and cards, so we made our best attempt to re-create them. Neither of us could remember one of the yellow streets, so he named it Jet Way.\\n\\n We proved surprisingly well matched, and I became engrossed in the game. The power shifted back and forth between us. Just when one of us seemed to have all the control, the other would seize it back. I had no doubts about my ability to win - until I lost. I sat there, dumbstruck, staring at the board.\\n\\n \"Have you ever lost a game before?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I . . . yes, of course . . . I just didn\u0027t think . . .\"\\n\\n \"That I could beat you?\"\\n\\n \"No, I just . . . it doesn\u0027t happen very often.\" I looked up at him and shook my head. \"Congratulations.\"\\n\\n He leaned back in his chair and laughed. \"I think beating you just improved your opinion of me more than anything else I\u0027ve ever done.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve always had a high opinion of you.\" I stretched out, surprised to feel kinks in my body. It was strange how these dreams could have such a realistic physical component. \"How long have we have been here?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s not morning yet.\" He appeared unconcerned. \"What do you want to play next?\"\\n\\n \"We shouldn\u0027t play anything,\" I said. I stood up. \"It\u0027s been hours. I\u0027m asleep, but you aren\u0027t. You can\u0027t stay up all night.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a vampire, Sage. A creature of the night, remember?\"\\n\\n \"One who\u0027s on a human schedule,\" I chastised.\\n\\n He still didn\u0027t seem worried. \"Only one class tomorrow. I\u0027ll make it up.\"\\n\\n \"What about the spirit?\" I began to pace restlessly as more of the implications hit me. \"You have to be using a lot of it. That\u0027s not good for you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take my chances.\" There was an unspoken for you at the end of his sentence.\\n\\n I returned to the table and stood in front of his chair. \"You have to be careful. Between this and the Veronica hunt. . . .\" I suddenly felt bad. I hadn\u0027t thought twice about asking him to help with that. I\u0027d forgotten the risks. \"Once we\u0027ve stopped her, you need to lay off the spirit.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry.\" He grinned. \"Once we\u0027ve gotten rid of that bitch, I\u0027ll be celebrating so much that I won\u0027t be sober for days.\"\\n\\n \"Ugh. Not the healthiest way to do it. Have you ever thought about antidepressants?\" I knew they helped some spirit users by blocking the magic.\\n\\n His smile vanished. \"I won\u0027t touch those things. Lissa took them and hated them. Being cut off from spirit nearly drove her crazy.\"\\n\\n I crossed my arms and leaned against the table. \"Yeah, but using it will drive you crazy too.\"\\n\\n \"No lectures tonight, Sage. It mars my stunning Monopoly victory.\"\\n\\n He was far too casual for such a serious matter, but I knew him well enough to recognize when he wouldn\u0027t yield. \"Fine. Then let\u0027s end on a high note. Send me back, and get some sleep.\"\\n\\n \"You sure you\u0027ll be okay?\" His concern was so intense. I didn\u0027t think anyone had ever worried about me that much. Well, maybe Ms. Terwilliger.\\n\\n \"Probably she gave up for the night.\" I really didn\u0027t know, but I couldn\u0027t let him keep exerting himself. The thought of Veronica reaching out again terrified me . . . but the thought of Adrian endangering himself almost scared me more. He\u0027d risked so much for me. Could I do any less? \"You can check on me tomorrow night, though.\"\\n\\n Adrian\u0027s face lit up as though I\u0027d just accepted a date. \"It\u0027s a deal, then.\"\\n\\n And like that, the reception hall dissolved around me. I returned to peaceful sleep and just barely heard him say, \"Sweet dreams, Sage.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-16.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
