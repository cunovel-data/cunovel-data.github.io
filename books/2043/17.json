{"id":109607,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"ALTHOUGH OUR MAGICAL PLANS had been derailed, Ms. Terwilliger had asked me to come by her room before classes started in the morning so that we could talk strategy and future assignments. I had just enough time to swing by the cafeteria for breakfast and found Jill, Eddie, and Angeline sitting together. It felt like it had been a long time since we\u0027d all been together in some kind of normal setting, and I welcomed this small moment of bonding. It was a refuge in the storm that had been my life recently.\\n\\n Jill was grinning about something that Eddie didn\u0027t seem to find so funny. \"He didn\u0027t say anything about it to me,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Of course not.\" Jill laughed. \"He\u0027s too embarrassed.\"\\n\\n I sat down with my tray. \"Who\u0027s too embarrassed?\" I assumed any \"he\" they were talking about must be Adrian, though it was hard to imagine Adrian embarrassed about anything.\\n\\n \"Micah,\" said Jill. \"I talked him into modeling for our sewing club again. And then he got Juan and Travis to do it too. \"\\n\\n \"How\u0027d you manage that?\" I asked. Jill had originally gotten involved with Lia through the school\u0027s sewing club. Back when Jill and Micah had dated, she\u0027d convinced him to model some very badly made clothes. He\u0027d done it out of adoration, though I wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d really enjoyed it.\\n\\n Jill leaned forward, an excited sparkle in her eyes. \"Claire guilted him into it! It was hilarious. But I don\u0027t know how he talked Juan and Travis into it. Maybe they owed him a favor.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe they have ulterior motives,\" said Eddie. His tone surprised me until I remembered his lesson about the latest social developments around here. What was it? Claire was Micah\u0027s new girlfriend. Juan and Travis were his friends, who liked Jill. Eddie didn\u0027t like that they liked her. Got it. Apparently, Eddie hadn\u0027t kept his opinions to himself because Jill rolled her eyes.\\n\\n \"Will you stop worrying about that?\" she asked. She was still smiling but sounded just a little annoyed. \"They\u0027re good guys. And I\u0027m not going to do anything stupid. You don\u0027t have to lecture me about humans and Moroi. I get it.\"\\n\\n Her jade eyes flicked over to me, and her smile faltered a little. She studied me for several long, troubled moments, and I wondered what she was thinking about. Was she still hoping for some romantic resolution between Adrian and me? Was she wondering why Adrian and I kept getting into intimate situations? I kind of wanted to know that too. She finally dragged her gaze away, letting her happy mood return.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just looking out for you,\" Eddie said obstinately.\\n\\n \"You look out for assassins. I can handle these guys. I\u0027m not a child, and besides, these are the most male models we\u0027ve ever had. It\u0027s great. If we could score a couple more, our club could do a whole project on men\u0027s clothing.\"\\n\\n Eddie still looked way too serious for this discussion. \"Maybe Eddie would volunteer,\" I suggested. \"I bet guardian posture would be great on the catwalk.\"\\n\\n He blushed, which even I had to admit was adorable. If Jill had been irritated by his earlier overprotectiveness, it was no longer obvious. From her dreamy expression, you\u0027d think Eddie blushing was the most amazing thing she\u0027d ever witnessed. I think he was too overwhelmed at the thought of strutting down a runway to notice.\\n\\n Angeline had been completely silent so far. I glanced over at her, expecting her to have something funny to say about her boyfriend being encouraged to model. But to my surprise, she wasn\u0027t paying attention to the conversation at all. She had a geometry book open and was furiously trying to draw some circles freehand. It killed me to watch, but after Kristin\u0027s comment about Angeline stabbing someone with a compass, freehand might be best.\\n\\n \"What do you think, Angeline?\" I asked, just to see how engrossed she was. \"Do you think Eddie would make a good model?\"\\n\\n \"Hmm?\" She didn\u0027t look up. \"Oh, yeah. You should let Jill try some clothes on you.\"\\n\\n Now Jill blushed. Eddie\u0027s deepened.\\n\\n Just when I thought this meal couldn\u0027t get any more surreal, Trey stopped by. He nudged Angeline\u0027s chair with his toe. \"Hey, McCormick.\" He nodded toward her graph paper. \"Time to check out your curves.\"\\n\\n Rather than answering with some biting response, she looked up instantly, a big smile on her face. \"I\u0027ve been working on them all morning,\" she said. \"I think they\u0027re pretty good.\"\\n\\n \"They look good from where I\u0027m standing,\" said Trey.\\n\\n They were actually the worst circles I\u0027d ever seen, but I guessed Trey wanted to encourage her. I was amazed at how seriously she was treating this math grade. It seemed to me that she was putting it above everything else, even her personal life. She gathered up all her things so that she and Trey could go to the library. Eddie looked disappointed but couldn\u0027t protest, lest it give away the truth about Angeline and him. Trey knew we weren\u0027t all actually related, but Eddie and Angeline\u0027s relationship was still kept secret.\\n\\n I realized then that it was almost time to meet Ms. Terwilliger. I hurriedly finished a banana and told Eddie and Jill I\u0027d see them later. Whether they would talk about male modeling or Jill\u0027s dating life, I couldn\u0027t guess.\\n\\n I showed up right on the dot for my meeting but found Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s room locked and dark. Even in crisis mode, I supposed she was entitled to run a little late now and then, so I settled down on the hallway floor and read ahead for my English class.\\n\\n I grew so absorbed that I didn\u0027t realize how much time had passed until I heard the warning bell ring and realized students were starting to fill the halls. I glanced up just as the same harried substitute teacher from before came scurrying up to the door with a set of keys. I scrambled to my feet.\\n\\n \"Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s out today?\" I asked. \"Is she okay?\"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t tell me the reasons,\" the sub said brusquely. \"They just ask me to be here. I hope she left an assignment this time.\"\\n\\n Knowing Ms. Terwilliger, I had a feeling it was going to be another \"homework\" day. I shuffled into the classroom after the sub, feeling a knot of anxiety in my stomach.\\n\\n The next hour was agonizing. I barely heard as the sub told us to work on homework. Instead, I kept sneaking glances at my cell phone, hoping a text would come from Ms. Terwilliger. No such luck.\\n\\n I went from class to class but was too distracted to give anything my full attention. I even shocked myself in English when I nearly mixed up Henry IV with Henry VI while answering an essay question. Thankfully, I caught myself before committing that embarrassing mistake to paper.\\n\\n When I returned to Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s classroom for my independent study at the day\u0027s end, I was expecting the sub to tell me I could leave early again. Instead, I found Ms. Terwilliger herself, rifling through papers on her desk.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re back!\" I exclaimed. \"I thought something had happened to you.\"\\n\\n \"Not me,\" she said. Her face was pale and drawn. \"But someone else wasn\u0027t so lucky.\"\\n\\n \"No. Not again.\" I sank into a chair, and all the fears I\u0027d been carrying around today came crashing down on me. \"I\u0027d hoped we\u0027d protected those girls.\"\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger sat down opposite me. \"It wasn\u0027t one of them. Last night, Veronica targeted one of my coven members. Alana.\"\\n\\n It took me several moments to truly process that. \"Your coven . . . you mean, like a full-fledged witch?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Someone like you?\"\\n\\n Her face gave me the answer before she spoke. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n I was reeling. \"But you said she only went after young girls.\"\\n\\n \"Normally she does. That way she can capture youth and beauty along with power.\" Ms. Terwilliger didn\u0027t look like she had to worry about someone stealing her youth anytime soon. Fatigue and stress were taking their toll on her, making her look older than she was. \"Now, some magic users who perform this spell are only concerned about power, not getting younger. That\u0027s never been Veronica\u0027s style, though. She\u0027s vain. She always wanted the superficial benefits - not to mention easier victims. Someone like my coven sister would be more difficult to take, so this is surprising behavior.\"\\n\\n \"It means you could be a target,\" I said. \"You\u0027ve been saying all this time that you\u0027re safe, but now everything\u0027s different.\"\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger shook her head, and a bit of steely resolve flashed in her eyes. \"No. Maybe she did this to throw me off, to make me think it\u0027s someone else behind the spells. Or maybe to make me think she\u0027s not interested in you. Whatever the reason, she won\u0027t target me.\"\\n\\n I admired Ms. Terwilliger for thinking so well of her sister, but I couldn\u0027t share her confidence that sisterly affection would overcome an evil quest for youth and power. \"No offense, ma\u0027am, but isn\u0027t there a slight chance you could be wrong about her coming for you? You said she\u0027d only go after young novices, but obviously, that\u0027s not the case. She\u0027s already doing things you didn\u0027t expect.\"\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger refused to back down. \"Veronica may do any number of terrible things, but she won\u0027t face me unless she\u0027s absolutely forced to.\" She handed over a new spell book and a small drawstring bag. \"Just because she went after an older witch, it doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027re out of danger. I\u0027ve marked some pages I want you to go over. There\u0027s a spell there I think will prove particularly useful. I\u0027ve gathered some components for you, and you should be able to cast the rest yourself - just make sure you do it somewhere remote. Meanwhile, I still need to make you that secondary charm. There\u0027s just so much to do lately.\"\\n\\n A mix of emotions swirled within me. Once again, I was amazed that Ms. Terwilliger would go to such lengths for me. Yet I couldn\u0027t shake my fear for her. \"Maybe you should make one for yourself, just in case.\"\\n\\n She gave me a wan smile. \"Still pushing that, hmm? Well, once I\u0027ve secured yours, I\u0027ll see about another. It may take a while, however. What I have in mind for you is particularly complex.\"\\n\\n That made me feel even worse. She always looked so worn out lately, and all these things she was doing for me were only intensifying the situation. But no matter how many arguments I made, she refused to listen. I left her classroom feeling upset and confused. I needed to vent to someone. Obviously, my choices were limited in this matter. I texted Adrian: V attacked a real witch last night. Ms. T won\u0027t protect herself. She\u0027s only worried about me. As usual, I received a quick response: Wanna talk about it?\\n\\n Did I? I wasn\u0027t the type to sit and analyze my feelings, but I did actually want company. I knew I shouldn\u0027t spend more time around Adrian than I had to when my feelings for him were already so mixed. But he was the only person I wanted to talk to. I have to cast some spells for her now. Want to pick me up and come along?\\n\\n My answer was a smiley face.\\n\\n She\u0027d told me to go somewhere remote, so I picked Lone Rock Park again. When Adrian and I arrived, it was smoldering in the late-afternoon heat, and I found it hard to believe Christmas was only a couple weeks away. I\u0027d dressed in layers, just like before, and took off my Amberwood hoodie as Adrian and I trekked across the rocky terrain. He took off a coat as well, and I had to do a double take when I saw what he was wearing underneath.\\n\\n \"Really?\" I asked. \"Your AYE shirt?\"\\n\\n He shot me a grin. \"Hey, it\u0027s a perfectly good shirt. I think I\u0027m going to see if I can start a chapter on Carlton\u0027s campus.\" Carlton was the college he took art classes at. It was pretty small and didn\u0027t even have fraternities or sororities.\\n\\n \"A chapter?\" I scoffed. \"Don\u0027t you mean the only chapter?\"\\n\\n \"Gotta start somewhere, Sage.\"\\n\\n We reached the same spot where I\u0027d practiced with Ms. Terwilliger, and I tried to ignore the scorch marks on the ground. Adrian had decided to turn this into a desert picnic and had brought along a basket containing a blanket and a thermos of lemonade. \"I figured we could stop at Pies and Stuff on the way back since I know how much you like that place,\" he explained, deadpan, as he poured me a cup. \"Hopefully this\u0027ll tide you over after the spell.\"\\n\\n \"I wish this was over,\" I said, running my hand over the weathered leather of Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s latest book. It was an old handwritten one called Summonings and Conjurations. \"I hate living with the uncertainty, worrying that Veronica\u0027s lurking behind every corner. My life\u0027s already complicated enough without witches coming after me.\"\\n\\n Adrian, face serious, stretched out on the blanket and propped his head up with his elbow. \"If she\u0027s even coming after you.\"\\n\\n I sat down cross-legged, careful to keep a lot more distance than in the Velvet Suite. \"Ms. Terwilliger won\u0027t listen to me. She just keeps stressing over me.\"\\n\\n \"Let her,\" he suggested. \"I mean, I totally get why you\u0027re worried about her. I am too. But we have to accept that she knows what she\u0027s talking about. She\u0027s been involved with this stuff a lot longer than we have.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help but smile at that. \"Since when are you involved with magic?\"\\n\\n \"Since I started looking after you and being all manly and brave.\"\\n\\n \"Funny, I don\u0027t remember it that way.\" I worked to keep a straight face. \"If you think about all the rides I gave you, me getting you into college . . . well, it kind of seems like I\u0027m looking after you.\"\\n\\n He leaned toward me. \"I guess we look after each other.\"\\n\\n We locked eyes and smiled, but there was nothing sensuous about it. There was no trick here, no sly move on Adrian\u0027s part to advance on me. And there was no fear on my part. We were just two people who cared about each other. It reminded me of what had initially drawn us together - before all the romantic complications. We connected. Against all reason, we understood each other, and - as he said - we looked out for each other. I\u0027d never had a relationship quite like that with anyone and was surprised at how much I valued it.\\n\\n \"Well, then, I guess I\u0027d better get to work.\" I glanced back down at the book. \"I haven\u0027t had a chance to look at what she wants me to do. It doesn\u0027t sound like a defensive book.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you\u0027re graduating from fireballs to lightning bolts,\" Adrian suggested. \"I bet it\u0027d be a lot like throwing ninja stars. Except, well, you could incinerate people.\"\\n\\n When I found the page Ms. Terwilliger had marked, I read the title aloud: \"Callistana Summoning.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s callistana mean?\" asked Adrian.\\n\\n I scrutinized the word, making sure I was deciphering the elaborate script correctly. \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s kind of like the Greek word for \u0027beautiful,\u0027 but not quite. The spell\u0027s subtitle is \u0027For protection and advanced warning.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s some kind of shield, like the one Jackie had,\" suggested Adrian. \"An easier one.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" I agreed. I wouldn\u0027t mind a little bit of invulnerability.\\n\\n I opened up the bag Ms. Terwilliger had given me. Inside, I found dragon\u0027s blood resin, a small bottle of gardenia oil, branches of juniper berries, and a glittering smoky quartz crystal, rutilated with lines of gold. Although she\u0027d provided the ingredients, the spell\u0027s directions required that I use and measure them in a very specific way, which made sense. As usual, it was the caster\u0027s work that powered the magic. Adrian sat up and read over my shoulder.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t really say what happens when you cast it,\" he pointed out.\\n\\n \"Yeah . . . I\u0027m not really excited about that part.\" Presumably, the caster was supposed to just know what she was doing. If this was some kind of protective shield, then maybe the shield would materialize around me, just as it had for Ms. Terwilliger. \"Well, no point in wasting time. We\u0027ll find out soon enough.\"\\n\\n Adrian chuckled as he watched me walk over to a clear piece of land. \"Am I the only one amazed that you now perform magic blindly?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I assured him. \"You\u0027re not the only one.\"\\n\\n I had to pluck the juniper berries off one by one and make a small ring with them, saying, \"Fire and smoke,\" each time I placed one on the ground. When I finished, I anointed each berry with a drop of the oil and recited, \"Breath and life.\" Inside the circle, I lit a small pile of the resin and rested the smoky quartz on top of it. Then I stepped back and reread the spell, committing the words and gestures to memory. Once I was satisfied I knew it, I handed it to Adrian and shot him a hopeful look.\\n\\n \"Wish me luck,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You make your own luck,\" he replied.\\n\\n I tried not to roll my eyes and turned toward the circle. I recited the spell\u0027s complex Greek incantation, pointing in the four cardinal directions as I spoke, per the book\u0027s instructions. It was startling how quickly the magic welled up within me, filling me with that blissful power. I spoke the last words, pointing at the juniper circle as I did. I felt the magic pour from me and into the quartz. Then I waited for something to happen.\\n\\n Nothing did.\\n\\n I looked back at Adrian, hoping he noticed something I hadn\u0027t. He shrugged. \"Maybe you did it wrong.\"\\n\\n \"It worked,\" I insisted. \"I felt the magic.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you just can\u0027t see it. At the expense of getting myself in trouble here, you should know how amazing you look when you do that stuff. All graceful and - \" His eyes went wide. \"Um, Sydney? That rock is smoking.\"\\n\\n I glanced back at the circle. \"That\u0027s just the resin that\u0027s - \"\\n\\n I stopped. He was right. Smoke was coming out of the quartz. I watched, fascinated, and then slowly, the quartz began to melt. Rather than dissipate into a puddle, though, the liquid began to re-form into a different shape, one that soon hardened into something new and unexpected: a crystalline dragon.\\n\\n It was small, able to fit in a palm, and glittered just like the dark brown quartz had. The dragon looked more like the serpentine kind usually associated with Chinese culture rather than the winged types of European myth. Every detail was meticulously carved, from the tendrils of its mane to the scales on its hide. It was stunning.\\n\\n Also, it was moving.\\n\\n I screamed and backed up, running into Adrian. He put an arm around me and held me as protectively as he could, though it was clear he was just as freaked out. The dragon opened its crystal eyelids and peered at the two of us with tiny golden eyes. It elicited a small croak and then began walking toward us, its small claws scraping against the rocks.\\n\\n \"What the hell is that?\" Adrian demanded.\\n\\n \"Do you really think I know?\"\\n\\n \"You made it! Do something.\"\\n\\n I started to ask what had happened to him looking out for me, but he had a point. I was the one who\u0027d summoned this thing. No matter where we moved or backed up to, the dragon continued to follow and make a small, high-pitched screeching noise that sounded like nails on a chalkboard. I groped for my cell phone and tried to dial Ms. Terwilliger, but there was no reception out here. Darting over to the blanket, I grabbed the spell book and then hurried back to Adrian\u0027s side. I flipped to the index, looking up callistana. There I found two entries: Callistana - Summoning and Callistana - Banishing. You would\u0027ve thought the two would be near each other in the book, but they were pages apart. I flipped to the latter and found the instructions brief and to the point: Once your callistana has been fed and rested, you may summon and banish it at will for a year and a day. A short incantation followed.\\n\\n I looked up at Adrian. \"It says we have to feed it.\"\\n\\n \"Will that make it shut up?\" he asked. His arm was around me again.\\n\\n \"I honestly don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe we can outrun it.\"\\n\\n All my instincts about hiding the supernatural world kicked in. \"We can\u0027t just leave it for some hiker to find! We have to get it some food.\" Not that I had any clue what to feed it. Hopefully humans and vampires weren\u0027t on the menu.\\n\\n A look of determination crossed Adrian\u0027s features. In a great show of bravery he lunged for the picnic basket and actually managed to scoop the dragon up in it. He slammed down the lid, and the mewling faded but didn\u0027t stop.\\n\\n \"Wow,\" I said. \"Manly and brave.\"\\n\\n Adrian regarded the basket with dismay. \"I just hope that thing doesn\u0027t breathe fire. At least it\u0027s contained. Now what do we do?\"\\n\\n \"Now we feed it.\" I made a decision. \"We take it to Pies and Stuff.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know if dragons ate pie, but that was the closest food source we had. Besides, I was pretty sure I\u0027d be able to get a cell phone signal there. So, Adrian drove us back to the little diner while I gingerly held the noisy basket. He went inside, and I stayed in the car and tried to call Ms. Terwilliger. I was sent to voice mail and didn\u0027t even bother with formalities. Was she never near her phone anymore?\\n\\n \"Call me now,\" I said through gritted teeth. The dragon\u0027s screeching was really starting to get to me.\\n\\n Adrian returned in about ten minutes carrying two bags. I stared in amazement as he got in the car. \"Did you buy out the store?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know what kind it wanted,\" he protested. Between the two bags, we had half a dozen slices of different kinds of pies. Each one\u0027s container was neatly labeled.\\n\\n \"I really don\u0027t know either,\" I said.\\n\\n Adrian sifted through the bags and pulled out a slice of coconut cream. \"If I were a dragon, this is what I\u0027d go for.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t argue, mainly because that statement had no logical argument. He took the lid off the pie and then looked at me expectantly. With a gulp, I opened the basket\u0027s lid and prayed the dragon wouldn\u0027t climb out and claw my face off. Adrian quickly set the pie down in the basket. Nervously, we both leaned forward to watch.\\n\\n At first, the dragon looked as though it really would climb out after us. Then it noticed the pie. The little crystal creature sniffed at the slice, circled it a few times, and then began gnawing at the pie in teeny-tiny bites. Best of all, the screeching stopped. We watched in wonder as the dragon made its way through a third of the coconut cream pie. Then, without warning, it rolled over onto its back and began to snore. Adrian and I sat there, frozen, and then finally dared to look at each other.\\n\\n \"I guess you were right about the flavor,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Do you think you can banish it now?\" he asked. \"Is it fed and rested enough?\"\\n\\n I retrieved the spell book to double-check the incantation. \"Time to find out.\"\\n\\n I recited the words. Smoke fluttered from the dragon\u0027s body. He began to shimmer, and within moments, we were looking at an inert piece of smoky quartz. In another valiant display, Adrian picked it up but held it as far away as possible as he studied it. The ringing of my phone startled both of us, and he dropped the crystal back into the basket. I looked at the phone\u0027s screen and saw Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s name.\\n\\n \"You made me summon a dragon!\" I exclaimed.\\n\\n \"I most certainly did not,\" she responded. \"Callistanas are a type of demon.\"\\n\\n I froze. \"A demon.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" she amended. \"A very minor and generally benign kind.\" I didn\u0027t reply for a while. \"Sydney? Are you still there?\"\\n\\n \"You had me summon a demon,\" I replied, voice stiff. \"You know how I feel about evil and the supernatural. You\u0027ve spent all this time trying to convince me that the magic we do is all for some greater good in the battle against evil, and yet you made me summon a creature of hell.\"\\n\\n \"Creature of hell?\" She snorted. \"Hardly. You know nothing about demons. I told you it\u0027s benign, didn\u0027t I? Callistanas can be very useful. They\u0027ll warn you if dark magic is nearby and will even try to defend you if you\u0027re attacked - not that they can do much damage.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t buying it. \"If they\u0027re so useful, then why don\u0027t you have one?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, well, I\u0027m at a level where I can sense dark magic on my own. That, and - if you\u0027ll forgive my language - callistanas are a real pain in the ass. They make the most irritating noise when they\u0027re hungry. Cats are more than adequate for my needs.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I said. \"I kind of noticed the noise part. I fed it some pie and turned it back into a rock.\"\\n\\n \"There, you see?\" She sounded happier than I\u0027d heard her in days. \"Look at the progress you\u0027ve made already. No matter what comes of this mess we\u0027ve found ourselves in, I\u0027m more convinced than ever that I made the right choice in guiding you on the magical path.\"\\n\\n I had too much going on to really appreciate the compliment. \"So what do I do now?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll disappear on its own after a year and a day. Until then, you can call it when you need it. You can try to train it. And of course, you\u0027ll have to feed it. Whatever you choose to do, it will be loyal to you. It bonds with the first person it sees and will need to spend time with you . . . Sydney? Are you there?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d gone silent again. \"The first person it sees?\" I finally managed to ask. \"Not the caster?\"\\n\\n \"Well, usually they\u0027re one and the same.\"\\n\\n I glanced over at Adrian, who was eating a piece of blackberry pie while listening avidly to my side of the conversation. \"What happens if there were two people there when it opened its eyes? Adrian was with me when I summoned it.\"\\n\\n Now she paused. \"Oh? Hmm, well, I probably should\u0027ve said something before you cast the spell.\"\\n\\n That had to be the understatement of the century. \"You should\u0027ve told me a lot of things before I cast it! What does it mean that the dragon - demon, whatever - saw both of us? Did it bond with both of us?\"\\n\\n \"Look at it this way,\" Ms. Terwilliger said, after several moments of thought. \"The callistana thinks of you two as its parents.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-17.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
