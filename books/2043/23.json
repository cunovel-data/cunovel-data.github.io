{"id":109613,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"FOR A MOMENT, I THOUGHT it had to be a coincidence. After all, what was so special about a peridot star? For all I knew, Alicia might have been born in August and was just sporting her birthstone among that mess of necklaces she always wore. And yet, if there was one thing I believed more than ever, it was Sonya\u0027s adage that there were no coincidences in the world of the supernatural.\\n\\n I sank to the floor and tried to reason my way through things. If the charm Alicia had worn was like this one, then it meant she too was a strong magic user trying to mask her abilities. Did she know about Veronica? Was Alicia trying to protect herself? If so, then it seemed like she wouldn\u0027t have been so casual about Veronica staying at the inn. So, that meant either Alicia didn\u0027t know about Veronica\u0027s true nature - again, a suspicious coincidence - or that Alicia was covering for Veronica.\\n\\n Could Alicia be in league with Veronica?\\n\\n That seemed the likeliest answer to me. Although Veronica apparently sought out young, powerful magic users, it was totally possible that she\u0027d seen the advantage of having one as an assistant. And, as we\u0027d observed, Veronica had plenty of other victims to choose from. Alicia could therefore help and cover up Veronica\u0027s nefarious plans - like when a curious couple came asking questions.\\n\\n I groaned. Alicia had been playing us from the beginning. From the instant we\u0027d stepped through her door with stories about our anniversary and \"friend\" Veronica, she\u0027d known we were lying. She\u0027d known we weren\u0027t actually friends with Veronica, and she might have been strong enough to fight Adrian\u0027s compulsion a little. She\u0027d gone along with everything - even being so helpful as to call me when Veronica had shown up again. I had no idea now what was true, if Veronica had ever left in the first place or returned from being gone. I did, however, have a sinking suspicion that my car wasn\u0027t the only one she\u0027d incapacitated.\\n\\n I could understand if she\u0027d used the cross to find me, but how had she initially located the Mustang? I racked my brain for any identifying information. Adrian\u0027s spirit magic should have muddled our appearances, covering up any connection to us. Then I knew. Alicia had walked us out and admired the Mustang. A clever person - someone who was already on high alert because of our visit - could\u0027ve made note of the license plate and used it to track down where Adrian lived.\\n\\n But why slash the tires? To delay us, I realized. That was the night Lynne had been attacked. And we had arrived too late to warn her.\\n\\n The more I began to sift through the events of the last few weeks, the more I began to think we had been very, very careless. We\u0027d thought we were being so cautious about concealing ourselves from Veronica. No one, not even Ms. Terwilliger, had considered that she might have an accomplice we also had to watch out for. And the dreams . . . those had started the day Adrian and I had been on the velvet bed. The day my garnet had slipped and had possibly been enough for Alicia to sense a magic user in the inn.\\n\\n Which brought me back to the present. Ms. Terwilliger. I had to tell her what I\u0027d found. I called for a third time. Still no answer. Although I often had images of Ms. Terwilliger conducting late-night rituals, it was entirely reasonable that she\u0027d be in bed right now. Was this the kind of thing that could wait until morning?\\n\\n No, I decided on the spot. No, it wasn\u0027t. We were dealing with dangerous, violent magic users - and my car had just been attacked. Something might be happening as I stood there, trying to decide. I would have to wake her up . . . provided I could get to her.\\n\\n It took only a moment to make my next decision. I called Adrian.\\n\\n He answered on the first ring but sounded wary, which I couldn\u0027t blame him for after what I\u0027d done earlier. \"Hello?\"\\n\\n I prayed he was the noble guy I thought he was. \"Adrian, I know things are bad between us, and maybe I have no right to ask, but I need a favor. It\u0027s about Veronica.\"\\n\\n There was no hesitation. \"What do you need?\"\\n\\n \"Can you come over to Amberwood? I need you to help me break curfew and escape my dorm.\"\\n\\n There were a few moments of silence. \"Sage, I\u0027ve been waiting two months to hear you say those words. You want me to bring a ladder?\"\\n\\n The plan was already unfolding in my head. The security guards that patrolled at night would have eyes on the student parking lot, but the back property would be relatively unguarded.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get myself out of the building. If you come up the main road that leads to Amberwood and then go past the driveway you\u0027ll see a little service road that runs up a hill and goes behind my dorm. Park there near the utility shed, and I\u0027ll meet you as soon as I get out.\"\\n\\n When he spoke again, his earlier levity was gone. \"I\u0027d really like to believe this is some awesome midnight adventure, but it\u0027s not, is it? Something\u0027s gone really wrong.\"\\n\\n \"Very wrong,\" I agreed. \"I\u0027ll explain in the car.\"\\n\\n I quickly changed into clean jeans and a T-shirt, adding a light suede jacket against the evening chill. To be safe, I also decided to pack my bag with a few supplies and bring it along. If all went well, I\u0027d simply be warning Ms. Terwilliger tonight. But with the way things had been going lately, I couldn\u0027t presume anything would be simple. Bringing the suitcase this time would be unwieldy, so I had to make a few quick decisions about chemicals and magical components. I tossed some in the bag and stuffed others in my jeans and coat pockets.\\n\\n Once I was ready, I headed down to Julia and Kristin\u0027s room. They were dressed for bed but not asleep yet. When Julia saw me with my coat and bag, her eyes went wide.\\n\\n \"Sweet,\" she said.\\n\\n \"I know you\u0027ve gotten out before,\" I said. \"How\u0027d you do it?\"\\n\\n Julia\u0027s many dates often occurred outside of sanctioned school hours, and both she and Kristin had bragged about Julia\u0027s exploits in the past. I\u0027d hoped perhaps Julia knew about a secret tunnel out of the school and that I wouldn\u0027t have to attempt some crazy feat of acrobatics. Unfortunately, that was exactly what I had to do. She and Kristin walked me to their window and pointed at a large tree growing outside it.\\n\\n \"This room has a view and easy access,\" said Kristin proudly.\\n\\n I eyed the gnarled tree warily. \"That\u0027s easy?\"\\n\\n \"Half the dorm\u0027s used it,\" she said. \"So can you.\"\\n\\n \"We should be charging people,\" mused Julia. She flashed me a smile. \"Don\u0027t worry. We\u0027ll give you a freebie tonight. Just start on that big limb there, swing over there, and then use those branches for handholds.\"\\n\\n I found it amazing that someone who\u0027d claimed badminton in PE was too \"dangerous\" would have no qualms about scaling a tree from her third-floor room. Of course, Marcus\u0027s apartment had been on the fourth floor, and that fire escape had been a million times more unsafe than this tree. Thoughts of Alicia and Ms. Terwilliger snapped me back to the importance of my mission, and I gave Julia and Kristin a decisive nod.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s do this,\" I said.\\n\\n Julia cheered and opened the window for me. Kristin watched just as eagerly. \"Please tell me you\u0027re running off to meet some breathtakingly handsome guy,\" she said.\\n\\n I paused, just as I was about to climb out. \"Yes, actually. But not in the way you\u0027re thinking.\"\\n\\n Once I made it to the limb Julia had indicated, I discovered she was right. It was pretty simple - so simple, in fact, that I was surprised no school official had noticed this easy access escape route and chopped it down. Well, so much the better for those of us with late-night errands. I made it to the ground and waved goodbye to my watching friends.\\n\\n The dorm\u0027s back property had some lights on it, exactly for the reason of deterring wayward students like me. It was also along the patrol route of one of the security guards but wasn\u0027t a spot he stayed regularly stationed at. He wasn\u0027t in sight, so I crossed my fingers that he was busy with another part of his beat. There were enough shadows on the lawn that I was able to stay within them the whole way - until I reached the back fence. It was lit up pretty well, and really, the only assets I had were that I was a fast climber and that the guard hadn\u0027t surfaced yet. Falling back on that hope that the universe owed me some favors - especially after tricking me about Alicia - I gulped and scrambled over. No one shouted at me when I landed on the other side, and I breathed a sigh of relief. I\u0027d made it out. Getting back in would be harder, but that was a problem for later, hopefully one Ms. Terwilliger could help out with.\\n\\n I found Adrian waiting for me in the Mustang, exactly where I\u0027d indicated. He gave me a sidelong glance as he drove us away. \"No black catsuit?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s in the laundry.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"Of course it is. Now, where are we going, and what\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s,\" I said. \"And what\u0027s going on is that we\u0027ve been walking around in front of the enemy this entire time without even realizing it.\"\\n\\n I watched Adrian as I related my revelations and saw his face go from disbelieving to dismayed the more I spoke. \"Her aura was too perfect,\" he said once I finished. \"Perfectly neutral, perfectly average. No one\u0027s is like that. I brushed it off, though. Figured maybe it was just a weird human one.\"\\n\\n \"Can someone influence how their aura looks?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Not to that extent,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know enough about these charms you guys use, but I\u0027m guessing it was one of those that skewed the way her colors looked.\"\\n\\n I slumped into the seat, still angry at not having figured this out sooner. \"On the bright side, she doesn\u0027t know we\u0027re on to her and Veronica. That could give us an advantage.\"\\n\\n When we reached Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s house, we found all the lights on, which was a surprise. I\u0027d assumed she was in bed, though this certainly wouldn\u0027t be the first time she\u0027d missed a phone call. Only, when we reached the house and knocked on the door, there was no answer. Adrian and I exchanged looks.\\n\\n \"Maybe she had to leave abruptly,\" he said. The tone of his voice conveyed what his words didn\u0027t. What if Ms. Terwilliger had already found out what we had and had taken off to fight Alicia and Veronica? I had no idea how powerful Alicia was, but the odds didn\u0027t seem promising.\\n\\n When no answer came from my second knock, I nearly kicked the door in frustration. \"Now what?\"\\n\\n Adrian turned the doorknob, and the door opened right up. \"How about we wait for her?\" he suggested.\\n\\n I grimaced. \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m comfortable breaking into her place.\"\\n\\n \"She left the door unlocked. She\u0027s practically inviting us in.\" He pushed the door open farther and looked at me expectantly.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want to go back to Amberwood without speaking to her tonight, nor did I want to sit on her doorstep. Hoping she wouldn\u0027t mind us making ourselves at home, I gave a nod of resignation and followed Adrian inside. Her house was the same as ever, cluttered and redolent with the scent of incense. Suddenly, I came to a standstill.\\n\\n \"Wait. Something\u0027s different.\" It took me a moment to figure it out, and when I did, I couldn\u0027t believe I hadn\u0027t realized it immediately. \"The cats are gone.\"\\n\\n \"Holy shit,\" said Adrian. \"You\u0027re right.\"\\n\\n At least one of them always came to greet visitors, and others were usually visible on furniture, under tables, or simply occupying the middle of the floor. But now, there were no cats in sight.\\n\\n I stared around in disbelief. \"What in the world could - \"\\n\\n An earsplitting shriek made me jump. I looked down toward my hip and found the dragon sticking his head out of my satchel and trying to claw his way up my side. Belatedly, I realized I\u0027d forgotten to cover the aquarium. He\u0027d apparently slipped inside the bag back in my room. The sound he was making now was similar to his hunger cry - except even more annoying. Then, impossibly, he nipped my leg. I bent over and tried to pull him off me.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have any pie! What are you trying to - ahh!\"\\n\\n Something zoomed over my head and smashed into the wall behind me with a loud splat. A couple wet drops of something landed on my cheek and began to burn. It was a wonder I didn\u0027t hear a sizzling sound.\\n\\n \"Sydney!\" Adrian cried.\\n\\n I turned toward where he was looking and saw Alicia standing in the doorway between the living room and the kitchen. Her palm was raised toward us, a shimmery and gooey substance cupped in it. Presumably it was the same substance that currently seared my skin. I almost wiped it away but feared I\u0027d simply be spreading it to my fingers. I winced and tried to ignore it.\\n\\n \"Sydney\" said Alicia pleasantly. \"Or should I say Taylor? I figured I\u0027d be seeing you two again. Just not so soon. I guess your car trouble didn\u0027t delay you tonight.\"\\n\\n \"We know everything,\" I told her, keeping on an eye on that goo. \"We know you\u0027re working for Veronica.\"\\n\\n The smug look on her face momentarily shifted, overcome by surprise. \"Working for her? I got rid of her ages ago.\"\\n\\n \"Got rid of. . . .\" For a few seconds, I was at a loss. Then the rest of the puzzle pieces fell together. \"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s been absorbing those girls. And that witch in San Diego. And . . . Veronica Terwilliger.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d been able to track Veronica back to the inn with the scrying spell. When Ms. Terwilliger had attempted a different locating spell, she\u0027d come up blank. She\u0027d assumed it was because Veronica had some sort of shielding. But the truth, I was suddenly certain, was that Veronica was already comatose. There was no active mind for Ms. Terwilliger to reach because Alicia had consumed Veronica.\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger . . .\\n\\n \"You\u0027re here for her,\" I said. \"Ms. Terwilliger. Not me.\"\\n\\n \"The untrained do make easy targets,\" conceded Alicia. \"But they don\u0027t have the same power as full-fledged witches, who can be just as easy to absorb if you break them down first. I don\u0027t need the youth like Veronica did, just the power. Once she showed me how the spell works, I was able to catch her in a weak moment. That other college girl tided me over until I wore down Alana Kale.\" Where had I heard that name? Alana . . . she was Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s comatose coven sister. \"And finally I can take out the big hit: Jaclyn Terwilliger. I actually wasn\u0027t sure if I\u0027d be able to break her, but it turns out she\u0027s done an awesome job of wearing herself out these last few weeks, all in the service of protecting her sweet little apprentice.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not her . . .\" I couldn\u0027t finish. I\u0027d been about to say I wasn\u0027t her apprentice, and yet . . . wasn\u0027t I? I wasn\u0027t just dabbling in magic anymore. I had joined the ranks. And now, I had to protect my mentor, just as she\u0027d protected me. If it wasn\u0027t too late.\\n\\n \"Where is she?\" I demanded.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s around,\" said Alicia, clearly delighting in having the upper hand here. \"I wish you hadn\u0027t found out about all this. You would\u0027ve made a good hit, once you\u0027d learned a little bit more. You\u0027re just a small spark to Jaclyn\u0027s flame right now. She\u0027s the big score tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Tell us where she is,\" ordered Adrian, a powerful note in his voice that I recognized.\\n\\n Alicia\u0027s gaze flicked from me to him. \"Oh, please,\" she scoffed. \"Stop wasting my time with your vampire compulsion. I realized what was going on after that first visit, when I kept having trouble remembering your faces.\" From her jumble of necklaces, she showed us a jade circle. \"I acquired this afterward. Makes me impervious to your \u0027charms.\u0027\"\\n\\n Something that resisted vampire magic? That would be a useful item to have in my bag of tricks. I\u0027d have to look into it . . . provided I survived tonight.\\n\\n I saw Alicia tense to throw again, and I managed to jump out of the way, pulling Adrian with me toward the living room. More of that goo splattered behind us with a hiss. I produced a dried thistle blossom and crumpled it toward Alicia, shouting a Greek incantation that would blind her. She made a small wave with her left hand and sneered at me.\\n\\n \"Really?\" she asked. \"That remedial blindness spell? Maybe you aren\u0027t a prodigy after all.\"\\n\\n Adrian suddenly flipped open a small panel in the wall beside us. I hadn\u0027t even noticed it, largely because I\u0027d been too distracted about having my face melted off. I saw a flurry of motion from his hand, and suddenly, we were plunged into darkness.\\n\\n \"Now this is remedial blindness,\" he muttered.\\n\\n Alicia swore. I froze, immobilized by the blackness around me. As much as I appreciated any attempts to slow Alicia down, I was kind of at a loss myself.\\n\\n I felt Adrian\u0027s hand grab hold of mine, and without a word, he tugged me farther into the living room. I followed quickly, relying on his superior vampire eyesight to guide us. I could already hear Alicia chanting and was sure some light-giving spell was coming soon. Either that or something that would magically fix a fuse box.\\n\\n \"Careful,\" Adrian murmured. \"Stairs.\"\\n\\n Sure enough, I felt my foot hit a wooden step. He and I hurried down as quietly and as quickly as we could, descending into a basement. My eyes still hadn\u0027t adjusted to the darkness, and I wondered if I\u0027d just entered some secret dungeon. Yet as he wound us through stacks of boxes, I realized the basement was just used for ordinary storage. There was a lot of junk down here. After seeing Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s already messy house, I wondered what more she could possibly own.\\n\\n Adrian finally stopped when we were in a far corner behind some oblong boxes stacked nearly as high as me. He pulled me to him, keeping me in his arms so that he could speak softly in my ear. My head lay against his chest, and I could hear his rapid heartbeat, a mirror for my own.\\n\\n \"That was a good idea,\" I said in as low a voice as I could manage. \"But now we\u0027re trapped down here. It would\u0027ve been better if we could go outside.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" he whispered back. \"But she was too close to the door, and I didn\u0027t have time to mess with a window.\"\\n\\n Above us, I could hear the floor creaking as Alicia walked through the house. \"It\u0027s just a matter of time,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I was hoping it\u0027d give you a chance to think of something to get us out of here. Can\u0027t you use that fireball? You were pretty good at it.\"\\n\\n \"Not inside. Especially not in a basement. I\u0027d burn this place down around us. And we don\u0027t know where Ms. Terwilliger is yet.\" I racked my brain. The house was small enough that there weren\u0027t that many places Alicia could have stashed Ms. Terwilliger. And I had to assume she was stashed somewhere, if she hadn\u0027t come to our aid already. Alicia\u0027s language made it sound like she hadn\u0027t sucked away Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s power yet, so hopefully she was just incapacitated.\\n\\n \"You must be able to do something,\" said Adrian, tightening his hold on me. \"You\u0027re brilliant, and you\u0027ve been reading all those spell books.\"\\n\\n It was true. I\u0027d consumed tons of material these last couple of months - material I wasn\u0027t even supposed to have learned - but somehow, in this one terrified moment, my mind couldn\u0027t focus on any of it. \"I\u0027ve forgotten everything.\"\\n\\n \"No, you haven\u0027t.\" His voice in the darkness was calm and reassuring. He smoothed back my hair and pressed one of those half kisses to my forehead. \"Just relax and focus. Sooner or later, she\u0027ll be coming down those stairs after us. We need to take her out or at least slow her down so that we can escape.\"\\n\\n His reasonable words centered me and allowed the gears of logic that ran my life to take over again. A little light was coming through from the basement\u0027s small, high windows, allowing my eyes to finally adjust and make out some of the dark shapes in the basement. I could still hear Alicia moving around upstairs, so I crept away from Adrian and walked over to the staircase. With a few graceful hand arcs, I chanted a spell over the steps and then hurried back to my corner with Adrian, slipping back under the shelter of his arm.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said. \"I think I\u0027ve got a minor delay ready.\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\" he asked.\\n\\n Just then, we heard the door at the top of the stairs open. Light spilled down, though we still remained in the shadows. \"You\u0027re out of options,\" I heard Alicia say. \"No place left to - ahh!\"\\n\\n There was a loud thump-thump-thump-thump as she went sliding down the stairs and hit the bottom with a crack.\\n\\n \"Invisible ice on the stairs,\" I told Adrian.\\n\\n \"I know I\u0027m not supposed to say this,\" he said. \"But I think I love you more than ever.\"\\n\\n I took his hand and tried not to think about how happy his words made me, even in this life-or-death situation. \"Come on.\"\\n\\n We left our hiding spot and found Alicia sprawled ungracefully on the floor, trying to get to her feet. A silver orb of light hovered in the air near her, bobbing along faithfully with her movements. Seeing us, she snarled and waved her hands to cast at us. I\u0027d anticipated this and had an amulet ready. I swung it on its silken cord and said a few quick words as we passed her. A brief, shimmering shield flared between us and her, just barely absorbing the small glowing darts she hurled our way. The shield was similar to the one Ms. Terwilliger had used at the park but had to be summoned on the spot and didn\u0027t last long.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what Alicia planned on doing next, but obviously, something bad was coming. I cast a preemptive spell I\u0027d never used before, one of the ones that Ms. Terwilliger had told me not to bother with. It took a lot of energy and was powerful if used correctly, yet was deceptively simple and elegant in its effects. I merely blasted Alicia across the room with a wave of power just as she was about to stand. She flew backward, into a stack of Christmas items. A box of ornaments fell down, shattering near her on the hard floor.\\n\\n Casting the spell left me dizzy, but I managed to keep moving. I summoned a fireball when we reached the stairs but held it in my hand, keeping it low as though I were going to roll a Skee-Ball - though my intent was simply to carry it. I prayed it would melt the ice, and after my first few steps, I knew I was right. \"Careful,\" I warned Adrian. \"They\u0027re wet.\"\\n\\n We made it to the top, but Alicia had already scrambled after us. From the bottom of the stairs, she used the same spell on me that I\u0027d used on her, throwing a wave of invisible energy at Adrian and me that knocked us to the floor. I\u0027d been holding on to the fireball, despite Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s warnings about how doing so would drain my own power. When Alicia knocked me down, the fireball flew from my hand and landed on Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s couch. Considering it looked as though it was covered in some cheap fabric from the 1970s, I wasn\u0027t entirely surprised that it lit up so fast.\\n\\n On the bright side, the fire solved our darkness problem. On the downside, it meant the house was likely going to burn down around us after all. The callistana, who hadn\u0027t been fast enough to keep up with us when we\u0027d gone downstairs, came scurrying over to my side. I had only half a heartbeat to make a decision.\\n\\n \"Go look in the rest of the house for Ms. Terwilliger,\" I told Adrian. \"I\u0027ll stop Alicia.\"\\n\\n The growing fire created weird shadows on his face, highlighting his anguish at this. \"Sydney.\"\\n\\n \"This is one of those times you have to trust me without question,\" I said. \"Hurry! Find her and get her out.\"\\n\\n I saw a thousand emotions flash through his eyes before he obeyed and ran off toward the other wing of the house. The fire was spreading rapidly throughout the living room, in a way that had to be magical. The increasing smoke gave me an idea, and I cast a spell that enhanced it, creating a hazy wall at the entrance to the basement stairs. It allowed the dragon and me to make a short retreat before Alicia appeared, parting the smoke as cleanly as though she were opening curtains.\\n\\n \"That,\" she declared. \"Hurt.\"\\n\\n I cast a spell that should\u0027ve encased her in spiderwebs, but they fell away before they even reached her. It was infuriating. I\u0027d memorized so much, but these \"remedial\" spells weren\u0027t working. I understood now why Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s main strategy had been for me to lie low and hide my ability. How would I have ever been able to take on Veronica? True, Alicia had taken her out, but only after probably weakening her as she had Ms. Terwilliger. I even understood now why Ms. Terwilliger had told me to get a gun - which, I realized now, I\u0027d left in the car.\\n\\n The ice spell had worked because Alicia hadn\u0027t seen it coming. The only other spell that had worked on her was the blast of power, an advanced one that had still left me weak. It was going to take another one of those, I realized. I had no idea if I had the ability to do a second one, but trying was the only chance I had of -\\n\\n I screamed as what felt like a thousand volts of electricity shot through me. Alicia\u0027s hand movement had been so subtle, and she hadn\u0027t even spoken. I fell down again, writhing in pain as Alicia strode toward me, her face triumphant. The dragon bravely put himself between the two of us, and she simply kicked him aside. I heard him yelp as he skittered across the floor.\\n\\n \"Maybe I should absorb you,\" said Alicia. The shocks abated, and I could only sit there and gasp for breath. \"You could be my fifth. I can come back for Jaclyn in a few years. You\u0027ve turned out to be a lot more powerful than I thought - and annoyingly resourceful. You even made a good effort tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Who says I\u0027m done?\" I managed to say.\\n\\n I cast the first of the advanced spells that came to mind. Maybe it was inspired by the broken Christmas ornaments, but suddenly, I had broken shards on the brain. The spell required no words or physical components and only the slightest of hand movements. The rest was taken from me - a draining of energy and power that hurt almost as much as the electrifying spell Alicia had just used.\\n\\n But oh, the results were breathtaking.\\n\\n On Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s coffee table (which was now on fire) sat a set of five perpetual motion balls. I used a transmutation spell on them, forcing them out of their spherical shape and breaking them apart into thin, sharp razor blades. They broke free of their strings and came at my command. That was the easy part.\\n\\n The hard part was, as Ms. Terwilliger had told me, actually attacking someone. And not just making them slip and fall. That wasn\u0027t so bad. But an actual physical attack, one you knew would cause direct and terrible damage, was an entirely different issue. It didn\u0027t matter how terrible Alicia was, that she\u0027d tried to kill me and wanted to victimize Ms. Terwilliger and countless others. Alicia was still a living person, and it was not in my nature to show violence or try to take another\u0027s life.\\n\\n It was, however, in my nature to save my own life and those of my loved ones.\\n\\n I braced myself and ordered the razors forward. They slammed into her face. She screamed and frantically tried to pull them out but in doing so lost her balance and went back down the stairs. I heard her shriek as she fell into the basement. Although I couldn\u0027t see her, her magical lantern orb merrily followed her all the way down.\\n\\n My triumph was short-lived. I was more than dizzy. I was on the verge of passing out. The heat and light from the fire were overwhelming, yet my vision was going dark from the exhaustion of casting a spell I was in no way ready for. I suddenly just wanted to curl up there on the floor and close my eyes where it was comfortable and warm. . . .\\n\\n \"Sydney!\"\\n\\n Adrian\u0027s voice jolted me out of my haze, and I managed to peer up at him through heavy eyelids. He slipped an arm around me to help me up. When my legs didn\u0027t work, he simply scooped me up altogether and carried me. The dragon, who\u0027d suffered no permanent damage from the kick, clung to my shirt and scurried into the bag that was still draped over my shoulder.\\n\\n \"Where . . . Ms. Terwilliger. . . .\"\\n\\n \"Not here,\" Adrian said, heading swiftly toward the front door. The fire was spreading over the walls and ceiling now. Although it hadn\u0027t quite made it to the front of the house yet, our way was still thick with smoke and ash. We both were coughing, and tears ran out of my eyes. Adrian reached the door and turn the knob, yelping at how hot it was. Then he managed to kick the door open with his foot, and we were free, out into the clean night air.\\n\\n Neighbors had gathered outside, and I could hear sirens in the distance. Some of the spectators watched us curiously, but most were transfixed by the inferno that was Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s bungalow. Adrian carried me over to his car and gently set me down so that I could lean against it, though he still kept an arm around me. We both stared in awe at the fire.\\n\\n \"I really did look, Sydney,\" he said. \"I couldn\u0027t find Jackie in the house. Maybe she escaped.\" I prayed he was right. Otherwise, we had just abandoned my history teacher to a fiery death. \"What happened to Alicia?\"\\n\\n \"Last I saw, she was in the basement.\" A sickening feeling twisted in my stomach. \"I don\u0027t know if she\u0027ll get out. Adrian, what have I just done?\"\\n\\n \"You defended yourself. And me. And hopefully Jackie.\" His arm tightened around me. \"Alicia was evil. Look what she did to those other witches - what she wanted to do to you guys.\"\\n\\n \"I never saw it coming,\" I said bleakly. \"I thought I was so smart. And each time I talked to her, I dismissed her as some dumb, scattered girl. Meanwhile, she was laughing and countering my moves every step of the way. It\u0027s humbling. I don\u0027t meet many people like that.\"\\n\\n \"The Moriarty to your Holmes?\" he suggested.\\n\\n \"Adrian,\" I said. It was all I needed to say.\\n\\n He suddenly did a double take, noticing my attire for the first time tonight now that the jacket had come open. \"You\u0027re wearing your AYE shirt?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I never wage magical battles without - \"\\n\\n A small mewling noise suddenly caught my attention. I searched around until I spotted two green eyes peering at me from under a bush across the street. I managed to straighten up and found that my legs, though weak, could support my weight again. I took a few halting steps toward the bush, and Adrian immediately ran to my side.\\n\\n \"What are you doing? You need help,\" he said.\\n\\n I pointed. \"We have to follow that cat.\"\\n\\n \"Sydney - \"\\n\\n \"Help me,\" I pleaded.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t resist. Supporting me with his arm again, he helped me walk across the street toward the cat. It ran ahead between two bushes, then glanced back at us.\\n\\n \"It wants us to follow,\" I told him.\\n\\n So we did, cutting through houses and streets until when we were about four blocks from the bungalow, the cat dashed off into a park. Whatever energy I\u0027d had when I started after the cat was long gone. I was panting and dizzy again and fighting hard to resist asking Adrian to carry me. Something in the center of the park caught my attention and gave me one last burst of adrenaline to run forward.\\n\\n There, lying on the grass, was Ms. Terwilliger.\\n\\n She was awake, thankfully, but looked nearly as exhausted as I felt. Tears and smudges suggested she\u0027d been through quite an ordeal. She had managed to escape Alicia, but not without a fight. That was why we hadn\u0027t been able to find her in the house. Seeing me, she blinked in surprise.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re okay,\" she said. \"And you found me.\"\\n\\n \"The cats led us,\" I said, pointing. All thirteen of them were sitting around in the park, surrounding their owner - making sure she was okay.\\n\\n She glanced around at them and managed a weary smile. \"See? I told you cats are useful.\"\\n\\n \"Callistanas aren\u0027t so bad either,\" I said, looking down at my satchel. \"That \u0027pain in the ass\u0027 screeching saved me from a face full of acid.\"\\n\\n Adrian put his hand to his heart in mock horror. \"Sage, did you just swear?\"\\n\\n Glancing over, Ms. Terwilliger noticed him for the first time. \"And you\u0027re here too? I\u0027m so sorry you had to get dragged into this mess. I know you didn\u0027t ask for any of this trouble.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" said Adrian, smiling. He rested a hand on my shoulder. \"Some things are worth the trouble.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-23.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
