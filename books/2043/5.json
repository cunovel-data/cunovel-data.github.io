{"id":109596,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"I LEFT SHORTLY THEREAFTER with the Alchemists and didn\u0027t expect to see Adrian for a little while. He was staying on with the other Moroi a couple more days in Pennsylvania, so there was no chance of a repeat flight together. My trip back to California was quiet and uneventful, though my mind raced with all the developments of the last couple of days. Between Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s cryptic warning and my new lead on Marcus, I had plenty to occupy me. A text message from Eddie greeted me when I hailed a cab at the Palm Springs airport: We\u0027re eating at Marquee\u0027s. Wanna join us? A follow-up message soon came: You can drive us back. I directed the driver to take me to a suburb on the far edge of the city rather than Amberwood\u0027s home in Vista Azul. I was hungry, seeing as there\u0027d been no dinner served on the plane in coach, and besides, I wanted my car back in my own hands. When I arrived at the restaurant, I found Eddie and Angeline sitting on one side of a booth with Jill on the other. Immediately, I knew why they\u0027d chosen to eat so far from our school. Being away meant Eddie and Angeline could go out as a couple. Back at Amberwood, everyone thought we were related. Eddie, Jill, and I passed ourselves off as siblings, while Angeline was our cousin. Eddie and Angeline had recently started dating, so they\u0027d had to hide their relationship from our classmates to avoid raising suspicions. We already seemed to attract enough attention as it was. Angeline was cuddled up in Eddie\u0027s arm. Even he looked like he was having a good time, which was nice to see. He took his responsibilities so seriously and was often so tense that it seemed as though it wouldn\u0027t take much to make him snap in two. Angeline - though uncouth, unpredictable, and often inappropriate - had proven remarkably good for him. That didn\u0027t make him any less diligent in his guardian duties, of course. Things were a little different on the opposite side of the table. Jill looked miserable, slumped into the seat with her arms crossed. Her light brown hair hung forward, covering part of her face. After ill-fated romances with a guy who wanted to become a Strigoi and with Eddie\u0027s human roommate, Jill had come to realize that Eddie might very well be the guy for her. It was fitting, too, because for a long time, he\u0027d harbored a secret crush on her, fiercely dedicated to her in the way a knight served his liege lady. He\u0027d never believed he was worthy of Jill, and without any signs of her affection, he\u0027d turned to Angeline - just when Jill had come around and wanted him. At times, it seemed like some sort of Shakespearean comedy . . . until I looked at Jill\u0027s face. Then I\u0027d feel conflicted because I knew if Eddie returned her affection, Angeline would be the one with that sad, sad expression. It was kind of a mess and made me glad to be free of any romantic entanglements. \"Sydney!\" Jill beamed when she saw me, brushing her hair away. Maybe it was because she needed the distraction, or maybe it was because Adrian\u0027s new attitude toward me had lifted some of her moodiness. Regardless, I welcomed a return to the old friendliness in her rather than the brooding and accusing looks she\u0027d harbored since I rejected him. \"Hey, guys.\" I slid into the booth beside her. Immediately, I opened up my cell phone\u0027s picture album and handed it to her since I knew she\u0027d want to know about the wedding right away. Despite all the intrigue that had gone down there, I had managed to take some pictures without the other Alchemists noticing. Even if she\u0027d seen some of it through Adrian\u0027s eyes, Jill would still want to examine everything in detail. She sighed with happiness as she scanned the pictures. \"Look at Sonya. She\u0027s so pretty.\" Angeline and Eddie leaned across the table to get a look. \"Oh. And there\u0027s Rose and Lissa. They look great too.\" There was an odd note in Jill\u0027s voice as she spoke. She was friends with Rose, but her half sister was still a bit of an enigma. Jill and Lissa hadn\u0027t even known they were sisters until recently, and the volatile political environment had forced Lissa to behave more as a queen than a sister toward Jill. It was a difficult relationship for both of them. \"Did you have a fun time?\" Eddie asked me. I considered my answer for several moments. \"I had an interesting time. There\u0027s still a lot of tension between the Alchemists and your people, so some of it was a little weird.\" \"At least Adrian was there. Must have been nice to have someone you know,\" said Angeline, in well-meaning ignorance. She pointed to a picture I\u0027d taken of the reception hall. My intent had been to get a full shot of the venue for Jill, but Adrian had happened to walk into the shot, posed and perfect like some handsome spokesmodel hosting the event. \"Always so pretty.\" Angeline shook her head in disapproval. \"Everyone there is. I guess that means there weren\u0027t any celebratory wrestling matches?\" It was a sign of Angeline\u0027s progress that she\u0027d deduced that so quickly. Her people, the Keepers, lived in the wilds of West Virginia, and their openness to romance between vampires, dhampirs, and humans was only one of their more bizarre customs. Friendly fights broke out often, and Angeline had had to learn that such behaviors weren\u0027t acceptable out here in mainstream America. \"Not while I was there,\" I said. \"But hey, maybe something went down after I left.\" That brought grins to Jill\u0027s and Eddie\u0027s faces and a hopeful look to Angeline\u0027s. A waitress came by, and I ordered Diet Coke and a salad. Maybe I\u0027d loosened up in my tight calorie counting, but I swore I could still taste the sugar from all the wedding cake I\u0027d eaten after the spell. Angeline tightened her hold on Eddie\u0027s arm and smiled up at him. \"If you ever get to see my home, you can fight my brother Josh to show that you\u0027re worthy of me.\" I had to swallow a laugh. I\u0027d seen the Keepers\u0027 community and knew she was absolutely serious. I worked to keep a straight face. \"Aren\u0027t you breaking a lot of rules by being together without that having happened yet?\" Angeline nodded, looking a little glum. \"My mom would be so scandalized if she knew. But I guess this is a unique situation.\" Eddie smiled indulgently at her. I think sometimes he thought we were exaggerating about the Keepers. He was going to be in for a shock if he ever did visit them. \"Maybe I can fight a bunch of your relatives to make up for it,\" he said. \"You might have to,\" she said, not realizing he was joking. It was hardly romantic banter, but Jill looked decidedly uncomfortable discussing their relationship. She turned to me, very obviously trying not to look at them. \"Sydney, what are we going to do about Christmas?\" I shrugged, unsure what she was asking. \"The usual, I guess. Give presents. Sing songs. Have Yuletide duels.\" Angeline lit up at that. Jill rolled her eyes. \"No, I mean, we\u0027re going to be on winter break in a few weeks. Is there any way . . . is there any way we can go home?\" There was a plaintive note in her voice, and even Eddie and Angeline broke their mutual admiration to stare at me. I shifted under their scrutiny. Angeline wasn\u0027t as concerned about visiting the Keepers, but I knew Eddie and Jill missed their friends and family. I wished I could give them the answer they wanted to hear. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"You\u0027ll be staying at Clarence\u0027s for break. We can\u0027t risk . . . well, you know.\" I didn\u0027t need to emphasize the need for Jill\u0027s safety. We were all familiar with that refrain. Ian\u0027s comment about how fragile the throne was drove home the importance of what we did. Jill\u0027s face fell. Even Eddie looked disappointed. \"I figured,\" she said. \"I just hoped . . . that is, I miss my mom so much.\" \"We can probably get a message to her,\" I said gently. I knew that was no substitute for the real thing. I was able to make occasional phone calls to my own mom, and hearing her voice was a million times better than any email could be. I even got to talk to my older sister, Carly sometimes, which always cheered me up since she was so bright and funny. My younger sister, Zoe . . . well, she was a different story. She wouldn\u0027t take my calls. She\u0027d nearly been initiated into the Alchemists - to take on this mission, in fact - when I\u0027d stolen it from her. I\u0027d done it to protect her from committing to the Alchemists so young, but she\u0027d seen it as an insult. Looking at Jill\u0027s sad face, I felt my heart clench. She had been through so much. Her new royal status. Targeted by assassins. Fitting in to a human school. Her disastrous and deadly romances. And now enduring Eddie and Angeline. She handled it all with remarkable strength, always resolutely going through with what she had to do even if she didn\u0027t want to do it. Lissa was praised for being such an exemplary queen, but there was a regality and strength to Jill as well that many underestimated. Glancing up, I caught a spark in Eddie\u0027s eyes as he too seemed to recognize and admire that about her. After dinner, I took them back to Amberwood and was pleased to see that my car was in perfect shape. I drove a brown Subaru named Latte, and Eddie was the only other person I trusted behind the wheel. I dropped him off at the boys\u0027 dorm and then took Angeline and Jill back to ours. As we were walking in the door, I caught sight of Mrs. Santos, a teacher I knew by reputation. \"You guys go ahead,\" I told Jill and Angeline. \"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\" They left, and I walked across the lobby, waiting patiently for Mrs. Santos to finish a discussion with our dorm matron, Mrs. Weathers. When Mrs. Santos started to turn around and leave, I caught her attention. \"Mrs. Santos? I\u0027m Sydney Melrose. I wondered if I could - \" \"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"I know who you are, dear. Ms. Terwilliger raves about you all the time at our department meetings.\" Mrs. Santos was a kindly-looking woman with silver and black hair. Rumor had it she\u0027d be retiring soon. I flushed a little at the praise. \"Thank you, ma\u0027am.\" She and Ms. Terwilliger were both history teachers, though Mrs. Santos\u0027s focus was on American history, not world. \"Do you have a minute? I wanted to ask you something.\" \"Of course.\" We stepped off to the side of the lobby, out of the incoming and outgoing dorm traffic. \"You know a lot about local history, right? Southern California?\" Mrs. Santos nodded. \"I was born and raised here.\" \"I\u0027m interested in nontraditional architecture in the Los Angeles area,\" I told her, the lie rolling easily off my lips. I\u0027d thought about this in advance. \"That is, non-Southwest styles. Do you know any neighborhoods like that? I\u0027d heard there were some Victorian ones.\" She brightened. \"Oh, yes. Absolutely. Fascinating subject. Victorian, Cape Cod, Colonial . . . there are all sorts. I don\u0027t have all the information on me, but I could email you when I get home tonight. There are several I know off the top of my head, and I know a historian who could help you with others.\" \"That\u0027d be great, ma\u0027am. Thank you so much.\" \"Always happy to help a star pupil.\" She winked as she started to walk away. \"Maybe next semester you\u0027ll do an independent study with me. Provided you can tear yourself away from Ms. Terwilliger.\" \"I\u0027ll keep it in mind,\" I said. As soon as she was gone, I texted Ms. Terwilliger. Mrs. Santos is going to tell me about historical neighborhoods. The response came quickly: Excellent. Come over right now. I scowled as I typed back: I just got here. Haven\u0027t even been in my room. To which she replied: Then you can get here that much faster. Maybe that was true, but I still took the time to put my suitcase back in my room and change out of my travel clothes. Ms. Terwilliger lived pretty close to the school and looked as though she\u0027d been pacing in circles when I arrived at her house. \"Finally,\" she said. I glanced at the time. \"It\u0027s only been fifteen minutes.\" She shook her head and again wore the same grim expression she\u0027d had out in the desert. \"Even that might be too much. Follow me.\" Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s home was a little bungalow that could have doubled as a New Age store or possibly a cat shelter. The level of clutter set my teeth on edge. Spell books, incense, statues, crystals, and all sorts of other magical items sat in piles in all rooms of the house. Only her workshop, the room she led me to, was neat and orderly - even to levels I approved of. Everything was clean and organized, to the point of being labeled and alphabetized. A large worktable sat in the center of the room, completely cleared off, save for a stunning necklace I\u0027d never seen before. The chain was made of intricate gold loops, and the pendant was a deep red cabochon stone in a lacy gold setting. \"Garnet?\" I asked. \"Very good,\" she said, lifting the necklace. The candlelight in the room seemed to make every part of it glitter. \"It\u0027s lovely,\" I said. She held it out to me. \"It\u0027s for you.\" I stepped back uneasily. \"For . . . me? I . . . I mean, thank you, but I can\u0027t accept a gift like that.\" \"It\u0027s not a gift,\" she said. \"It\u0027s a necessity. One that might save your life. Take it and put it on.\" I refused to touch it. \"It\u0027s magical, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"And don\u0027t give me that look. It\u0027s no different from any of the charms you\u0027ve made for yourself.\" \"Except that anything you\u0027d make . . .\" I swallowed as I stared into the depths of that bloodred jewel. \"It\u0027s going to be a lot more powerful than anything I can create.\" \"That\u0027s exactly the point. Now here.\" She thrust it so close to me that it nearly swung out and hit me in the face. Steeling myself, I reached out and took it from her. Nothing happened. No smoke or sparks. No searing pain. Seeing her expectant look, I fastened it around my neck, letting the garnet lie next to my cross. She sighed, her relief nearly palpable. \"Just as I\u0027d hoped.\" \"What?\" I asked. Even if I sensed nothing special about it, the garnet felt heavy around my neck. \"It\u0027s masking your magical ability,\" she said. \"No one who meets you should be able to tell that you\u0027re a magic user.\" \"I\u0027m not a magic user,\" I reminded her sharply. \"I\u0027m an Alchemist.\" A small flicker of a smile played over her lips. \"Of course you are - one who uses magic. And to a particularly powerful person, that would be obvious. Magic leaves a mark on your blood that permeates your whole body.\" \"What?\" I couldn\u0027t have been more shocked if she\u0027d said I\u0027d just contracted a deadly disease. \"You never told me that before!\" \"It wasn\u0027t important,\" she said with a small shrug. \"Until now. I need you hidden. Do not take that off. Ever.\" I put my hands on my hips. \"Ma\u0027am, I don\u0027t understand.\" \"All will be revealed in time - \" \"No,\" I said. At that moment, I could have been talking to Stanton or any of the countless others who\u0027d used me and fed me pieces of information throughout my life. \"It will be revealed now. If you\u0027ve gotten me into something dangerous, then you either need to get me out of it or tell me how to.\" Ms. Terwilliger stared at me for several quiet moments. A gray tabby cat rubbed up against my legs, ruining the seriousness of the moment. \"You\u0027re right,\" she said at last. \"I do owe you an explanation. Have a seat.\" I sat down on one of the stools by the table, and she sat opposite me. She clasped her hands together in front of her and seemed to be having a hard time gathering her thoughts. I had to force myself to stay calm and patient. Otherwise, the panic that had been gnawing at me since the desert would completely consume me. \"You remember that woman you saw in the picture?\" she asked at last. \"Your sister.\" Ms. Terwilliger nodded. \"Veronica. She\u0027s ten years older than me and looks half my age, as you could undoubtedly tell. Now, it isn\u0027t difficult to create an illusion. If I wanted to appear young and beautiful, I could - emphasis on appear. But Veronica? She\u0027s actually managed to make her body young and vibrant. It\u0027s an advanced, insidious kind of magic. You can\u0027t defy age like that without making some sacrifices.\" She frowned, and my heart pounded. Creating youth made all my Alchemist sensibilities reel. It was nearly as bad as Strigoi immortality, maybe worse if she was talking about a human doing it. That kind of twisted magic had no place in this world. Her next words drove home the wrongness of it all. \"Or, in her case, sacrificing others.\" Sacrifice. The very word seemed to poison the air. She stood up and walked over to a shelf, producing a newspaper clipping. Wordlessly, she handed it to me. It was a recent article, from three days ago, talking about a nineteen-year-old UCLA student who\u0027d been found comatose in her dorm room. No one knew what had caused it, and the girl was hospitalized with no indication of when or if she\u0027d wake up. \"What is this?\" I asked, not sure I wanted to know the answer. I inspected the article more closely, especially the picture it contained. At first, I wondered why the paper would show a sleeping old woman. Then, reading the fine print, I learned that the coma victim also displayed some unexplained physical symptoms: gray-streaked hair and dry, cracked skin. Doctors were currently investigating rare diseases. I cringed, unable to believe what I saw. She was hideous, and I couldn\u0027t look at her for very long. And just like that, I suddenly understood. Veronica wasn\u0027t sacrificing victims with knives and stone altars. She was conducting some kind of perverse magic on these girls that bent the rules of nature, putting them in this hideous state. My stomach twisted, and I gripped the table for support. \"This girl was one of Veronica\u0027s victims,\" confirmed Ms. Terwilliger. \"That\u0027s how she maintains her youth and beauty - by taking it from others. When I read this, I thought - almost hoped - some other magic user was doing it. Not that I\u0027d wish this on anyone. Your scrying spell confirmed she was in the area, however, which means it\u0027s my responsibility to deal with her.\" I dared a look down at the article again and felt that nausea well up again. The girl was nineteen. What would it be like to have the life sucked out of you at so young an age? Maybe the coma was a blessing. And how corrupt and twisted would you have to be to do that to someone? I didn\u0027t know how exactly Ms. Terwilliger would \"deal with\" her sister and wasn\u0027t sure I wanted to find out. And yet, if Veronica really was doing things like this to innocents, then yes, someone like Ms. Terwilliger needed to stop her. A magical attack of this magnitude was one of the most terrible things I could imagine. It brought back all my ingrained fears about the wrongness of magic. How could I justify using it when it was capable of such horror? Old Alchemist lessons came back to me: Part of what makes the Moroi particularly dangerous is their ability to work magic. No one should be able to twist the world in that way It\u0027s wrong and can easily run out of control. I tuned back into the present. \"How do I fit into this, ma\u0027am? I already figured out where she is. Why am I in danger?\" \"Sydney,\" Mrs. Terwilliger said, looking at me strangely. \"There are few young women out there with your abilities. Along with youth and beauty, she intends to suck someone\u0027s magic away and use it to make herself that much more powerful. You, my dear, would be the ultimate coup for her.\" \"She\u0027s like Strigoi,\" I murmured, unable to repress a shiver. Although those undead vampires could feast on anyone, they preferred Moroi because they had magic in their blood. Drinking Moroi blood made Strigoi more powerful, and a chilling thought suddenly hit me. \"Practically a human vampire.\" \"Something like that,\" Ms. Terwilliger agreed. \"This amulet should hide your power, even from someone as strong as her. She shouldn\u0027t be able to find you.\" A calico cat jumped up on the table, and I ran a hand over her sleek fur, taking comfort in the small contact. \"The fact that you keep saying \u0027should\u0027 makes me a little nervous. Why would she even come looking in Palm Springs? Does she know about me yet?\" \"No. But she knows I\u0027m here, and she may check on me once in a while - so I need to hide you in case she does. I\u0027m in a bind, however, because I need to find her but can\u0027t actively do the hunting. If she finds out I\u0027m investigating, she\u0027ll know that I know she\u0027s here. I can\u0027t alert her. If I have the element of surprise on my side, I\u0027m more likely to stop her.\" She frowned. \"I\u0027m honestly surprised she would come so close to me in California at all. Regardless, I need to keep a low profile until it\u0027s time to strike.\" Ms. Terwilliger looked at me meaningfully, and I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach as I began to put together what she was saying. \"You want me to hunt her.\" \"It\u0027s not hunting so much as gathering some data. You\u0027re the only one I can trust to do this. She and I can sense each other if we\u0027re close, no matter how much we try to hide our magic. I know this is going to sound shocking, but I actually think it\u0027d be best if you hunted her - even if you\u0027re the one she\u0027s after. You\u0027re one of the few I can trust completely and you\u0027re resourceful enough to pull something like this off.\" \"But I\u0027d be putting myself out there. You just said I\u0027d be a big catch for her.\" The twists and turns here were mindboggling. \"Yes. Which is why I gave you the amulet. She won\u0027t sense your magic, and if you\u0027re cautious in your investigation, she should have no reason to notice you.\" I still wasn\u0027t following the logic here. \"But why me? You have a coven. If you can\u0027t do it yourself, then there must be someone else - a stronger witch - who can do it.\" \"Two reasons,\" she said. \"One is that you have excellent investigative skills - more so than others older than you. You\u0027re intelligent and resourceful. The other reason . . . well, if another witch goes after her, she might very well kill Veronica.\" \"Would that be such a bad thing?\" I didn\u0027t like violence and killing by any means, but this might be a case where it was justified, if it could save other lives. \"You said you were going to \u0027take care of her.\u0027\" \"If I have no choice . . . if I must kill her, then I will.\" She looked dejected, and I had a moment of empathy. I loved my two sisters. What would I do if I was ever in a deadly conflict with one of them? Of course, it was hard to imagine Zoe or Carly committing this kind of atrocity. \"However, there are other ways of neutralizing and subduing a magic user. If there\u0027s any way - any way at all - I can do that, I will. My coven sisters won\u0027t feel that way, which is why I need your help.\" \"I can\u0027t.\" I pushed the stool back and stood up, nearly stepping on a cat in the process. \"There must be some other way you can do this. You know I\u0027m already bogged down in supernatural affairs.\" I actually couldn\u0027t bring myself to admit the real reason I wanted to dodge this. It was about more than just risking my life. So far, all my magical interactions had been with Ms. Terwilliger. If I signed on for this, I would be plunging into the world of witches, something I\u0027d sworn I would never do. Ms. Terwilliger tapped the article, and her voice was quiet when she spoke. \"Could you let this happen to other girls, knowing there\u0027s a way you could stop it? I\u0027ve never heard of any of her victims waking up. The way this spell works, Veronica needs to renew it every few years, and it requires five victims within one month. She did this once before, and it caught me off guard. This time, we have warning. Four more people could suffer this fate. Do you want that?\" There it was. She\u0027d called me on the other part that had been nagging me because she knew me too well. I couldn\u0027t let innocents suffer, not even if it meant risking myself or facing the fears that haunted me. If I could stop this, I had to. No one deserved the fate of that girl in the paper. \"Of course not.\" \"And let\u0027s not forget that you could soon be one of her victims.\" I touched the garnet. \"You said I\u0027m hidden.\" \"You are, for now. And I hope against all hope you\u0027ll stay that way.\" I\u0027d never seen her so grim before, and it was hard to watch. I was used to her prattling, bumbling, no-nonsense nature. \"But here\u0027s something I\u0027ve never told you about how magic users sense each other.\" Something I\u0027d learned over the years: it was never a good thing when people said, \"Here\u0027s something I never told you. . . .\" I braced myself. \"Untrained magic users have a particular feel that\u0027s unique from the more experienced,\" she explained. \"There\u0027s a oh, wild-ness about the magic that surrounds you. It\u0027s easy for advanced witches to sense. My coven keeps track of novice magic users, but those are tightly guarded secrets. Veronica won\u0027t have access to those names, but there are spells she can use that can pick up on some of that untamed magic if it\u0027s near her. It\u0027s how she probably found this poor girl.\" Ms. Terwilliger nodded toward the article. The idea of me having some \"wild\" magical aura was as shocking as her saying I had magic in my blood. \"When she absorbs a victim,\" Ms. Terwilliger continued, \"she gets a burst of that wildness. It fades quickly, but when she possesses it, it can briefly enhance her ability to scry for another untrained victim. The more victims she takes, the stronger that ability will grow. There\u0027s a chance,\" Ms. Terwilliger said gravely, \"that it could be enough to break apart the garnet. I don\u0027t know.\" She spread out her hands. \"So you\u0027re saying . . . with each victim she attacks, the chance that she\u0027ll find me increases.\" \"Yes.\" \"All right. I\u0027ll help you hunt for her.\" I shoved all my fears and doubts aside. The stakes were too high. My life, the other girls . . . Veronica had to be stopped for all our sakes. Someone like her couldn\u0027t be allowed to go on like this. \"There\u0027s more,\" added Ms. Terwilliger. Really? \"More than hunting an evil witch who wants to drain me of my life and power?\" \"If we can stop Veronica from finding less powerful victims, we can save their lives and limit her ability to find you.\" She produced a small velvet bag and emptied it out onto the table. Several small agate circles fell out. \"These are charms that have some ability to mask magic. Not as strong as the garnet - that would take too long. But they\u0027re a quick fix that might save some of these other girls\u0027 lives.\" I knew where this was going. \"And you want me to deliver them.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. I know I\u0027m giving you some very difficult tasks here.\" This was getting worse and worse. \"Difficult? That\u0027s an understatement. And putting aside the fact that you want me to find a woman who could suck my life away there\u0027s also the very small detail that the Alchemists would flip out if they knew I was involved with any of this.\" Ms. Terwilliger didn\u0027t answer right away. She just watched me. A black cat jumped up beside her and joined in the staring. Its yellow-eyed gaze seemed to say Do the right thing. \"Where do I start?\" I asked finally. \"Finding that neighborhood is part of it, right?\" \"Yes. And I\u0027ll tell you where to find her potential victims, if you\u0027ll do the legwork of warning them. My coven keeps track of them. They\u0027ll be girls very much like you, ones with power who refuse to train and have no mentor to look after them. Once we have a clear fix on Veronica herself . . .\" Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s eyes hardened. \"Well, then. That\u0027s when I\u0027ll step in.\" Once more, I wondered if I really wanted to know what that entailed. A moment later, she added, \"Oh, and I thought it would be a good idea to obscure your appearance as well.\" I brightened. I couldn\u0027t explain it, but somehow, that made me feel immensely better. \"There are a lot of spells for that, right?\" I\u0027d seen a number of them in my studies. Even if I had to use magic, it was better to at least look different. \"Yes. . . .\" She drummed her fingers against the table. \"But the amulet might not be able to hide you wearing an \u0027active\u0027 spell, which would then defeat the whole purpose. What I was actually hoping was that your \u0027brother\u0027 Adrian might be able to help.\" My legs felt weak, and I sat back down. \"Why on earth should Adrian be involved in this?\" \"Well, he seems like he\u0027d do anything for you.\" I eyed her, wondering if there was a double meaning in that. Her gaze was far away, her thoughts turned inward. She\u0027d meant her words honestly. \"Veronica wouldn\u0027t be able to detect vampire magic. His power . . . that spirit element he was telling me about . . . it can confuse the mind, right? Affect what others can see?\" \"Yes. . . .\" She focused on me again, nodding in satisfaction. \"If he could accompany you, help muddle whoever meets you . . . well, that would offer an extra level of protection.\" I still didn\u0027t know what all I\u0027d be doing to hunt Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s sister, but it sounded like, at the very least, there\u0027d be a drive to Los Angeles in my future. Me, trapped in another small space with Adrian while he continued with that infuriating \"loving from afar.\" I was so caught up in the emotional turmoil that idea caused that it took me a moment to realize the larger issue I was letting myself get sucked into. \"Do you realize what you\u0027re asking?\" I said quietly. I touched the garnet again. \"To be a part of this, you\u0027re asking me to expose myself to both human magic and vampire magic. Everything I try to avoid.\" Ms. Terwilliger snorted, and for the first time tonight, I saw a return of her usual amused attitude. \"Unless I\u0027m mistaken, you\u0027ve been exposing yourself to both kinds of magic for some time now. So, it can\u0027t go against your beliefs that much.\" She paused meaningfully. \"If anything, it seems like it goes against the Alchemists\u0027 beliefs.\" \"The Alchemists\u0027 beliefs are my beliefs,\" I said quickly. She arched an eyebrow. \"Are they? I would hope your beliefs would be your beliefs.\" I\u0027d never thought about it that way before, but I suddenly hoped desperately that her words were true.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-5.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
