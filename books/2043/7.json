{"id":109598,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"I MIGHT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED to find Marcus, but I certainly wasn\u0027t going to argue against a gun.\\n\\n I raised my hands in the air and slowly stood up, keeping my back to the newcomer. Just as carefully, I stepped away from Marcus and set the vial on the floor. Fumes still wafted out of it, but the reaction would burn itself out soon. Then I dared a peek behind me. When I saw the girl who stood there, I could barely believe my eyes.\\n\\n \"Are you okay?\" she asked Marcus. He was unsteadily getting to his feet. \"I left as soon as you called.\"\\n\\n \"You!\" I couldn\u0027t quite manage anything more articulate.\\n\\n The girl standing before me was close to my age, with long, tangled blond hair. She still had the gun on me, but a small smile appeared on her face.\\n\\n \"Nice to see you again.\"\\n\\n The feeling wasn\u0027t mutual. I\u0027d last seen this girl when I faced down the Warriors in their arena. She\u0027d been toting a gun there as well and had had a perpetual snarl on her face. She\u0027d pushed me around and threatened me, making no secret of how heretical she thought my defense of Sonya was. Although she seemed much calmer now than she had with those fanatics, I still couldn\u0027t dismiss what she was - or what the implications were. I turned to Marcus in disbelief. He was cradling the wrist I\u0027d nailed with my elbow.\\n\\n \"You . . . you\u0027re one of them! One of the Warriors of Light!\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t think I\u0027d ever been so let down in my life. I\u0027d had so many hopes pinned on Marcus. He\u0027d become larger than life in my mind, some rebel savior who was going to tell me all the secrets of the world and free me from being another cog in the machine of the Alchemists. But it was all a lie. Clarence had mentioned Marcus had convinced the Warriors to leave him alone. I\u0027d assumed it was because Marcus had some incredible leverage he could use against the Warriors, but apparently, the key to his influence was that he was one of them.\\n\\n He looked up from his wrist. \"What? Those nuts? Hell, no.\"\\n\\n I almost pointed at the girl but decided it would be best not to make any sudden moves. I settled for a nod in her direction and noticed all the locks on the door had been undone. I\u0027d been so caught up in the struggle with Marcus that I hadn\u0027t heard them. \"Really? Then how come one of them just saved you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not really one of them.\" She spoke almost casually, but the gun contradicted her tone. \"I mean, I guess I kind of am. . . .\"\\n\\n \"Sabrina\u0027s a spy,\" explained Marcus. He looked much more at ease too, now that I wasn\u0027t assaulting him. \"A lovely one. She\u0027s been undercover with them for over a year. She\u0027s also the one who told me about you.\"\\n\\n Once again, it was hard knowing how to respond to that. I also wasn\u0027t sure if I bought this spy story. \"What exactly did you tell him?\"\\n\\n He shot me a movie star smile. His teeth were so white that I wondered if he had veneers. It seemed out of character for a rogue who lived on the run, but nothing about this day was really turning out like I\u0027d expected. \"She told me about this Alchemist girl who defended a Moroi and then helped lead a dhampir raiding party.\"\\n\\n Lead? Hardly. No one - notably Stanton - had felt the need to enlighten me about that raid until I was in the middle of it. I didn\u0027t want to tip my hand too early though. \"The Alchemists sanctioned that raid,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I saw the way you spoke,\" said Sabrina. Her eyes flicked between Marcus and me, fierce for me and admiring for him. \"It was inspiring. And we watched you for a while, you know. You spent an awful lot of time with the Moroi and dhampirs in Palm Springs.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my job,\" I said. She hadn\u0027t really seemed inspired at the time. Mostly she\u0027d looked disappointed at not having a chance to use the gun on me.\\n\\n Marcus\u0027s smile turned knowing. \"From what I heard, you and those Moroi almost looked like friends. And then, here you are, looking for me. You\u0027re definitely the dissident we\u0027d hoped for.\"\\n\\n No, this was not turning out at all like I\u0027d planned. In fact, it was pretty much the opposite of what I\u0027d planned. I\u0027d been so proud of my ability to track down Marcus, little knowing that he\u0027d been watching me already. I didn\u0027t like that. It made me feel vulnerable, even if they were saying some of things I\u0027d hoped to hear. Needing to feel like I was in control, I tried to play it cool and tough.\\n\\n \"Maybe there are other Alchemists about to show up,\" I said.\\n\\n \"They would\u0027ve been here already\" he said, calling my bluff. \"They wouldn\u0027t have sent you alone . . . though I did panic when I first saw you. I didn\u0027t realize who you were and thought there were others right behind you.\" He paused, and that cocky attitude turned sheepish. \"Sorry about, um, punching you. If it makes you feel better, you did something pretty serious to my wrist.\"\\n\\n Sabrina\u0027s face filled with concern. \"Oh, Marcus. Do you need to see a doctor?\"\\n\\n He tested the movement of his wrist and then shook his head. \"You know we can\u0027t. Never know who might be watching at a hospital. Those places are too easy to monitor.\"\\n\\n \"You really are hiding from the Alchemists,\" I said in amazement.\\n\\n His nodded, almost looking proud. \"You doubted? I figured you\u0027d know that.\"\\n\\n \"I suspected, but I didn\u0027t hear it from them. They deny you exist.\"\\n\\n He seemed to find that funny. In fact, he seemed to find everything funny, which I found slightly irritating. \"Yup. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve heard from the others.\"\\n\\n \"What others?\"\\n\\n \"Others like you.\" Those blue eyes held me for a moment, like they could see all my secrets. \"Other Alchemists wanting to break free of the fold.\"\\n\\n I knew my own eyes were wide. \"There . . . there are others?\"\\n\\n Marcus settled on the floor, leaning against the wall and still cradling his wrist. \"Let\u0027s get comfortable. Sabrina, put the gun away. I don\u0027t think Sydney\u0027s going to give us any trouble.\"\\n\\n Sabrina didn\u0027t look so sure of that, but after several moments, she complied. She joined him on the floor, positioning herself protectively next to him. \"I\u0027d rather stand,\" I told them. No way would I willingly sit on that filth. After rolling around with Marcus, I wanted to go bathe myself in hand sanitizer.\\n\\n He shrugged. \"Suit yourself. You want some answers? You give me some first. Why\u0027d you come looking for me off the Alchemist clock?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t like being interrogated, but what was the point of being here if I wasn\u0027t going to engage in a dialogue?\\n\\n \"Clarence told me about you,\" I said at last. \"He showed me your picture, and I saw how you\u0027d tattooed over the lily. I didn\u0027t even know that was possible.\" The tattoo never faded.\\n\\n \"Clarence Donahue?\" Marcus looked genuinely pleased. \"He\u0027s a good guy. I suppose you\u0027d be friends with him if you\u0027re in Palm Springs, huh?\"\\n\\n I started to say we weren\u0027t friends but then reconsidered. What else were we?\\n\\n \"Getting this isn\u0027t easy,\" added Marcus, tapping the blue tattoo. \"You\u0027ll have to do a lot of work if you want to do it.\"\\n\\n I stepped backward. \"Whoa, I never said that\u0027s what I wanted. And why in the world would I do it anyway?\"\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027ll free you,\" he said simply. \"It prevents you from discussing vampire affairs, right? You don\u0027t think that\u0027s all it does, do you? Think. What stops it from exerting other control?\"\\n\\n I pretty much had to just give up on any expectations for this conversation because every topic was crazier than the last. \"I\u0027ve never heard of anything like that. I\u0027ve never felt anything like that. Aside from it protecting vampire information, I\u0027m in control.\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"Probably. The initial tattoo usually only has the talking compulsion in it. They only start adding other components with re-inks if they\u0027ve got a reason to worry about you. People can sometimes fight through those and if they do . . . well, then it\u0027s off to re-education.\"\\n\\n His words sent a chill through me, and I rested a hand on my cheek as I flashbacked to the meeting I\u0027d had when I was given the Palm Springs assignment. \"I was re-inked recently . . . but it was routine.\" Routine. Normal. Nothing like what he was suggesting.\\n\\n \"Maybe.\" He tilted his head and gave me another piercing look. \"You do anything bad before that, love?\"\\n\\n Like helping a dhampir fugitive? \"Depends on your definition of bad.\"\\n\\n Both of them laughed. Marcus\u0027s laugh was loud and rollicking and actually pretty infectious - but the situation was far too dire for me to join in.\\n\\n \"They may have reinforced your group loyalty then,\" he said, still chuckling. \"But it either wasn\u0027t very strong or else you fought through it - otherwise you wouldn\u0027t be here.\" He glanced over at Sabrina. \"What do you think?\"\\n\\n Sabrina studied me with a critical eye. I still had a hard time believing her role in all of this. \"I think she\u0027d be a good addition. And since she\u0027s still in, she could help us with that . . . other matter.\"\\n\\n \"I think so too,\" he said.\\n\\n I crossed my arms over my chest. I didn\u0027t like being discussed as though I weren\u0027t there. \"A good addition to what?\"\\n\\n \"Our group.\" To Sabrina, he said, \"We really need a name for it, you know.\" She snorted, and he returned his attention to me. \"We\u0027re a mix. Some are former Warriors or double agents like Sabrina. Some are ex-Alchemists.\"\\n\\n \"And what do you do?\" I gestured around us. \"This doesn\u0027t exactly look like a high-tech base of operation for some covert team.\"\\n\\n \"Look at you. Pretty and funny,\" he said, looking delighted. \"We do what you do - or what you want to do. We like the Moroi. We want to help them - on our own terms. The Alchemists theoretically want to help them too, but we all know that\u0027s based on a core of fear and dislike - not to mention a strict control of its members. So, we work in secret, seeing as the Alchemists aren\u0027t fans of those who break from the fold. They really aren\u0027t fans of me, which is why I end up in places like this.\"\\n\\n \"We keep an eye on the Warriors too,\" said Sabrina. She scowled. \"I hate being around those nuts, having to play along with them. They claim they only want to destroy the Strigoi - but, well, the things I\u0027ve heard them say against the Moroi too . . .\"\\n\\n I thought back to one of my more disturbing memories of the Warrior arena. I\u0027d heard one of them make a mysterious comment about how someday, they\u0027d deal with the Moroi too.\\n\\n \"But what do you guys actually do?\" Talking about rebellions and covert operations was one thing, but actually effecting change was another. I\u0027d visited my sister Carly at her college and seen a number of student groups who wanted to change the world. Most of them sat around drinking coffee, talking a lot and doing little.\\n\\n Marcus and Sabrina exchanged glances. \"I can\u0027t quite get into our operations,\" he said. \"Not until I know you\u0027re on board with breaking your tattoo.\"\\n\\n Breaking your tattoo. There was something sinister - not to mention permanent - about those words, and I suddenly wondered what I was doing here. Who were these people, really? Why was I even humoring them? Then another, almost terrifying thought hit me: Am I doubting them because of the tattoo\u0027s control? Is it making me skeptical around anyone who questions the Alchemists? Is Marcus telling the truth?\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really understand that either,\" I told them. \"What it means to \u0027break\u0027 the tattoo. Do you just mean putting ink over it?\"\\n\\n Marcus stood up. \"All in good time. Right now, we\u0027ve got to get out of here. Even if you were discreet, I assume you used Alchemist resources to find me?\"\\n\\n I hesitated. Even if these guys were legitimate and had good intentions toward the Moroi, I certainly wasn\u0027t going to reveal my involvement with magic. \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re good, but we can\u0027t take the chance. This place has been compromised.\" He cast a wistful glance around the studio. Honestly, I thought he should be grateful I\u0027d given him a reason to leave.\\n\\n Sabrina rose as well, her face hardening. \"I\u0027ll make sure the secondary location is ready.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re an angel, as always,\" he told her.\\n\\n \"Hey, how did you know I was coming?\" I asked. \"You had time to hide and call her.\" What I really wanted to know was how he\u0027d seen me through the invisibility spell. I\u0027d felt the magic fill me. I was certain I\u0027d cast the spell correctly, but he\u0027d discovered me. The spell wouldn\u0027t work if someone knew to look for you, so maybe he\u0027d happened to glance out the window when I was scaling the fire escape? Worst timing ever.\\n\\n \"Tony warned me.\" Marcus flashed me another of those dazzling grins. I think he was trying to make me smile back. \"Good kid.\"\\n\\n Tony? Then I knew. The boy in the parking lot. He\u0027d pretended to help me and then sold me out. He must have spoken to Marcus while I climbed the fire escape. Maybe Marcus only answered to some secret knock. At least I had the comfort of knowing I\u0027d cast the spell correctly. It simply hadn\u0027t worked because Marcus had advance warning that some girl was coming after him.\\n\\n He began packing up his meager belongings into a backpack. \"The Catcher in the Rye is a great book, by the way.\" He winked. \"Maybe someday we\u0027ll have a literary discussion.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t interested in that. Watching him, I saw that he kept favoring his uninjured wrist. I couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d caused damage like that and felt a little guilty, despite everything that had happened. \"You should get that taken care of,\" I said. Sabrina nodded in agreement.\\n\\n He sighed. \"I can\u0027t. At least, not through conventional means. The Alchemists have eyes everywhere.\"\\n\\n Conventional means.\\n\\n \"I, uh, might be able to help you get it healed through unconventional means,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You know some off-the-grid doctor?\" asked Sabrina hopefully.\\n\\n \"No. But I know a Moroi spirit user.\"\\n\\n Marcus froze, and I kind of liked that I\u0027d thrown him off guard. \"Seriously? We\u0027ve heard of them but never met one. That woman they had - Sonya? She was one, right? She was gone before we could find out more.\"\\n\\n Talking about Adrian made me nervous, but Sabrina probably already knew he existed if they\u0027d been watching me. \"Yeah, she was one, and there\u0027s another in Palm Springs. I could take you to him and let him heal you.\"\\n\\n Excitement lit Marcus\u0027s features. Sabrina looked at him in horror. \"You can\u0027t just go off with her.\" Was that concern or jealousy in her voice?\\n\\n \"Why not?\" he asked. \"She\u0027s taking a leap of faith with us. We can\u0027t do any less. Besides, I\u0027m dying to meet a spirit user. The safe house isn\u0027t that far from Palm Springs. You make sure everything\u0027s in order and then come pick me up later.\"\\n\\n Sabrina didn\u0027t like that, not at all. Maybe I didn\u0027t understand the dynamics of their group yet, but it was obvious she regarded him as a leader and was insanely protective. In fact, I suspected her feelings for him were more than professional. They went back and forth on whether he\u0027d be safe or not, and I listened without a word. All the while, I wondered if I\u0027d be safe heading off with some unknown guy. Clarence trusted him, I reminded myself. And he\u0027s pretty paranoid. Besides, with Marcus\u0027s wrist out of commission, I could probably take him.\\n\\n He finally convinced Sabrina to let him go but not before she snarled, \"If anything happens to him, I\u0027m coming after you.\" Apparently her hard-core character in the arena hadn\u0027t been entirely faked.\\n\\n We parted ways from her, and before long, Marcus and I were on the road to Palm Springs. I tried to get more information out of him, but he wouldn\u0027t bite. Instead, he kept complimenting me and saying things that were only one step away from pickup lines. Judging from the way he\u0027d bantered with Sabrina too, I didn\u0027t think there was anything particularly special about me. I thought he was just used to women fawning all over him. He was cute, I\u0027d give him that, but it took a lot more than that to win me over.\\n\\n It was sunset when we pulled up to Adrian\u0027s apartment, and I belatedly wondered if I should\u0027ve given him some advance warning. Too late now.\\n\\n We walked up to the door, and I knocked three times. \"It\u0027s open,\" a voice called from within. I stepped inside, and Marcus followed.\\n\\n Adrian was working on an abstract painting of what looked like a crystalline building from some fantasy world. \"Unexpected treat,\" he said. His eyes fell on Marcus and widened. \"I\u0027ll be damned. You found him.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks to you,\" I said.\\n\\n Adrian glanced over at me. A smile started to form - and then instantly dried up. \"What happened to your face?\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" I lightly touched the swollen spot. It still smarted but wasn\u0027t as painful as it had been earlier. I spoke my next words without thinking. \"Marcus hit me.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d never seen Adrian move so fast. Marcus had no chance to react, probably because he was exhausted from our earlier encounter. Adrian shoved Marcus up against a wall and - to my complete and utter astonishment - punched Marcus. Adrian had once joked that he never dirtied his hands, so this was something I never could have prepared myself for. In fact, if Adrian was going to attack someone, I would\u0027ve expected something magical and spirit-driven. Yet . . . as I watched him, I could see that anything as thoughtful as magic was far from Adrian\u0027s mind. He had kicked into primal mode. See a threat. Go after it. It was yet another surprising - yet fascinating - side of the enigma that was Adrian Ivashkov.\\n\\n Marcus quickly got his bearings and responded in kind. He pushed Adrian back, wincing a little. Even with his injury he was still strong. \"What the hell? Who are you?\"\\n\\n \"The guy that\u0027s going to kick your ass for hurting her,\" said Adrian.\\n\\n He tried another punch, but Marcus dodged and managed to land a hit that knocked Adrian back into one of his easels. When Marcus swung again, Adrian eluded him with a maneuver that was straight out of Wolfe\u0027s class. I would\u0027ve applauded him if I wasn\u0027t so appalled by the situation. I knew some girls thought it was sexy to have men fight over them. Not me.\\n\\n \"You guys, stop!\" I cried.\\n\\n \"No one\u0027s going to throw you around and get away with it,\" said Adrian.\\n\\n \"What happened with us has nothing to do with you,\" retorted Marcus.\\n\\n \"Everything about her has to do with me.\"\\n\\n The two circled around each other, waiting for the other to pounce. \"Adrian,\" I exclaimed. \"It was an accident.\"\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t look like an accident,\" he replied, never taking his eyes off Marcus.\\n\\n \"You should listen to her,\" growled Marcus. The easygoing guy I\u0027d met earlier was gone, but I guess being attacked would do that to you. \"It might save you from getting your pretty face wrecked. How much styling did you have to do to get your hair like that?\"\\n\\n \"At least I brush my hair,\" said Adrian.\\n\\n Marcus lunged forward - but not directly at Adrian. He grabbed a painting off an easel and used it as a weapon. Adrian again managed a dodge, but the painting didn\u0027t fare so well. The canvas tore, and Marcus tossed it aside, ready for the next advance.\\n\\n Adrian spared the canvas a brief glance. \"Now you\u0027ve really pissed me off.\"\\n\\n \"Enough!\" Something told me they weren\u0027t going to listen to reason. This required direct intervention. I stalked across the room and pushed myself between them.\\n\\n \"Sydney, get out of the way,\" ordered Adrian.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" agreed Marcus. \"For once he\u0027s got something worthwhile to say.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" I held out my hands to separate them. \"Both of you back off - now!\" My voice rang through the apartment, and I refused to budge. \"Back. Off,\" I repeated.\\n\\n \"Sydney. . . .\" Adrian\u0027s voice was a little more uncertain than when he\u0027d told me to get out of the way.\\n\\n I looked back and forth between them, giving each guy a healthy glare. \"Adrian, it really was an accident. Marcus, this is the guy who\u0027s going to help you, so show some respect.\"\\n\\n This, more than anything, seemed to derail them.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" said Adrian. \"Did you say \u0027help\u0027?\"\\n\\n Marcus was equally flabbergasted. \"This asshole is the spirit user?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re both acting like idiots,\" I scolded. The next time I had nothing to do, I\u0027d have to get a book on testosterone-driven behavior. This was out of my league. \"Adrian, can we talk somewhere in private? Like the bedroom?\"\\n\\n Adrian agreed, but not before giving Marcus one last menacing look. I told Marcus to stay where he was and hoped he wouldn\u0027t take off or call in someone else with a gun. Adrian followed me to his bedroom and shut the door behind us.\\n\\n \"You know,\" he said, \"under normal circumstances, you inviting me to the bedroom would be the highlight of my day.\"\\n\\n I crossed my arms and sat on the bed. I did so out of simple fatigue, but a moment later, I was struck by what I was doing. This is where Adrian sleeps. I\u0027m touching the covers he\u0027s wrapped in every night. What does he wear? Does he wear anything?\\n\\n I jumped up.\\n\\n \"It really was an accident,\" I told him. \"Marcus thought I was there to abduct him.\"\\n\\n Adrian, having no such hang-ups with the bed, sat down. He winced, probably from the blow to the stomach. \"If someone like you showed up to abduct me, I\u0027d let you.\"\\n\\n Even when he was in pain, it never stopped with him. \"I\u0027m serious. It was just instinct, and he apologized over and over in the car once he realized who I was.\"\\n\\n That got his attention. \"He knew you?\"\\n\\n I gave him a recap of my day in Santa Barbara. He listened avidly, nodding along, his expression shifting back and forth between intrigue and surprise.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t realize when I brought him back here that you\u0027d inflict more damage,\" I said, once I\u0027d finished the story.\\n\\n \"I was defending your honor.\" Adrian gave me that devil-may-care smile that always managed to both infuriate and captivate me. \"Pretty manly, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Very,\" I said dryly. I didn\u0027t like violence, but him doing something so out of character for me actually was kind of incredible. Not that I\u0027d ever tell him that. \"You did Wolfe proud. Do you think you can manage not to have any more \u0027manly\u0027 displays while he\u0027s here? Please?\"\\n\\n Adrian shook his head, still smiling. \"I\u0027ve said over and over, I\u0027d do anything for you. I just keep hoping it\u0027ll be something like, \u0027Adrian, let\u0027s go hot tubbing\u0027 or Adrian, take me out for fondue.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Well, sometimes we have to - did you say fondue?\" Sometimes it was impossible to follow Adrian\u0027s train of thought. \"Why in the world would I ever say that?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I like fondue.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t even know what to say about that. This whole day was getting more and more exhausting. \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m not asking for something as glamorous as melted cheese. But for now, I need to find out about Marcus and his group - and the tattoo.\"\\n\\n Adrian recognized the situation\u0027s severity. He stood up and gently touched the lily on my cheek. \"I don\u0027t trust him. He could be using you. But then . . . I don\u0027t like the idea of this controlling you either.\"\\n\\n \"That makes two of us,\" I admitted, losing some of my earlier toughness.\\n\\n He traced the line of my cheek for a few breathless moments and then dropped his hand. \"It might be worth helping him to get some answers.\"\\n\\n \"Will you promise not to get in any more fights? Please?\"\\n\\n \"I promise,\" he said. \"So long as he doesn\u0027t start one.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have him promise too.\" I just hoped their \"manly\" natures wouldn\u0027t get the better of them. As I ruminated on this, something I\u0027d nearly forgotten about tumbled to the forefront of my mind. \"Oh . . . Adrian, I\u0027ve got one more favor to ask you. A big one.\"\\n\\n \"Fondue?\" he asked hopefully.\\n\\n \"No. It\u0027s about Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s sister. . . .\"\\n\\n I told him what I\u0027d learned. The amusement in his face faded and turned to disbelief. \"You just mention this now?\" he exclaimed when I finished. \"That some soul-sucking witch might be after you?\"\\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t know I exist.\" I felt surprisingly defensive. \"And I\u0027m the only one who can help, at least according to Ms. Terwilliger. She thinks I\u0027m some super-investigator.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you do have that Sherlock Holmes thing going for you,\" he said. His joking didn\u0027t last; he was too upset. \"But you still should\u0027ve told me! You could\u0027ve called.\"\\n\\n \"I was kind of busy with Marcus.\"\\n\\n \"Then your priorities are off. This is a lot more important than his band of Merry Men. If we need to take out some evil sorceress before she gets to you, then of course I\u0027ll help.\" He hesitated. \"With one condition.\"\\n\\n I eyed him warily. \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Let me heal you too.\"\\n\\n I jerked backward, almost more shocked than if he\u0027d suggested hitting me again. \"No! Absolutely not! I don\u0027t need it. I\u0027m in better shape than him.\"\\n\\n \"You want to go back to Amberwood with that on your face? You\u0027re not going to be able to hide that, Sage. And if Castile sees it, he really will come after Marcus.\" Adrian crossed his arms defiantly. \"That\u0027s my price.\"\\n\\n He was bluffing, and I knew it. Maybe it was egotistical, but I knew he wasn\u0027t going to let me go into a dangerous situation without him. He did, however, have a point. I still hadn\u0027t seen the mark Marcus had left, but I didn\u0027t want to explain it back at school. And yes, there was a good chance Eddie would want to hunt down my assailant. Being beat up by an avenging dhampir might make working with Marcus difficult.\\n\\n Yet . . . how could I agree? At least the magic I used was on my terms. And although my tattoo had trace amounts of vampire magic, I took comfort in knowing it was tied to the \"normal\" four elements, the ones we understood. Spirit was still an unknown entity, with abilities that continually surprised us. How could I subject myself to rogue vampire magic?\\n\\n Guessing my inner turmoil, Adrian\u0027s face softened. \"I do this all the time. It\u0027s an easy spell. No surprises.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" I said reluctantly. \"But each time you use spirit, you\u0027re more likely to go crazy.\"\\n\\n \"Already crazy about you, Sage.\"\\n\\n At least this was familiar territory. \"You said you wouldn\u0027t bring that up.\"\\n\\n He simply regarded me without comment. Finally, I threw my arms up. \"Fine,\" I said, with more boldness than I felt. \"Just get it over with.\"\\n\\n Adrian didn\u0027t waste any time. Stepping forward, he reached out and rested his hand on my cheek once more. My breath caught and my heart rate went up. It would be so, so easy for him to pull me to him and kiss me again. A tingling warmth spread over my skin, and for a moment, I thought it was just my normal reaction to him. No, I realized. It was the magic. His eyes locked onto mine, and for the space of a heartbeat, we were suspended in time. Then he removed his hand and stepped away.\\n\\n \"Done,\" he said. \"Was that so bad?\"\\n\\n No, it hadn\u0027t been bad at all. The throbbing pain was gone. All that was left was the constant inner voice nagging me that what had just happened was wrong. That same voice tried to tell me that Adrian had left a taint behind . . . but that was hard to believe from him. I released the breath I\u0027d been holding.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I said. \"You didn\u0027t have to do that.\"\\n\\n He gave me one of those small smiles. \"Oh, believe me, I did.\"\\n\\n A moment of awkward silence hung between us. I cleared my throat. \"Well. We should get back out to Marcus. Maybe we\u0027ll have time for dinner before Sabrina shows up, and you guys can patch things over.\"\\n\\n \"I doubt even a moonlight stroll would fix things between us.\"\\n\\n His words reminded me of something else I\u0027d meant to bring up when he got back to town, something that had taken a very low priority. \"Your coat - you never took it back after the wedding. It\u0027s in my car.\"\\n\\n He waved dismissively \"Keep it. I\u0027ve got others.\"\\n\\n \"What am I going to do with a wool coat?\" I asked. \"Especially here in Palm Springs?\"\\n\\n \"Sleep with it,\" he suggested. \"Think of me.\"\\n\\n I put my hands on my hips and tried to stare him down, which wasn\u0027t easy since he was so tall. That, and because his words suddenly returned me to the disorienting feeling I\u0027d had sitting on his bed. \"You said you weren\u0027t going to bring up any romantic stuff around me.\"\\n\\n \"Was that romantic?\" he asked. \"I was just making the suggestion, since the coat\u0027s so heavy and warm. I figured you\u0027d think of me since it was such a nice gesture. And yet, once again, you\u0027re the one who finds romantic subtext in everything I say.\"\\n\\n \"I do not. You know that\u0027s not what I meant.\"\\n\\n He shook his head in mock sympathy. \"I tell you, Sage. Sometimes I think I\u0027m the one who needs to take out the restraining order on you.\"\\n\\n \"Adrian!\"\\n\\n But he was already out the door, knowing laughter echoing behind him.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-7.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
