{"id":109600,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"AS JILL HAD SAID, Adrian was more than happy to begin our hunt that afternoon. In fact, when I finally got ahold of him, he offered to pick me up when classes ended, in order to maximize our time. I didn\u0027t mind this since it meant I\u0027d get to ride in the Mustang. Admittedly, I would\u0027ve preferred to drive it myself, but I\u0027d take what I could get. \"When are you going to name the car?\" I asked him once we were on the road to Los Angeles. \"It\u0027s an inanimate object,\" he said. \"Names are for people and pets.\" I patted the Mustang\u0027s dashboard. \"Don\u0027t listen to him.\" To Adrian, I said, \"They name boats all the time.\" \"I don\u0027t really understand that either, but maybe I would if my old man ever fronted me the money for a private yacht.\" He shot me a quick, amused look before returning his attention to the road. \"How can someone as cold and logical as you be so obsessed with something as frivolous as this?\" I wasn\u0027t sure which part bothered me the most - being called cold or obsessed. \"I\u0027m just giving the proper respect to a beautiful machine.\" \"You named your car after coffee. That\u0027s a sign of respect?\" \"The highest1respect,\" I said. He made a noise that sounded like a cross between a scoff and a laugh. \"Okay, then. You name it. Whatever you want, I\u0027ll go along with.\" \"Really?\" I asked, a bit startled. True, I\u0027d been badgering him about naming the car, but I wasn\u0027t sure I wanted to be the one to wield that sort of power. \"It\u0027s a big decision.\" \"Life or death,\" he said, deadpan. \"Better choose carefully.\" \"Yeah, but you\u0027re the so-called creative one!\" \"Then this\u0027ll be good practice for you.\" I fell silent for a good part of the drive, struck by the gravity of the dilemma that lay before me. What should the name reflect? The car\u0027s sunny yellow color? Sleek lines? Powerful engine? The task was overwhelming. Adrian pulled me out of my thoughts when we began nearing the outer Los Angeles suburbs. \"We\u0027re not actually going into the city, are we?\" \"Huh?\" I\u0027d been waging a mental debate between Summer Wind and Gold Dust. \"Oh, no. We\u0027re heading north. Take the next exit.\" Mrs. Santos had provided me with two neighborhoods known for their Victorian-style houses. I\u0027d researched them extensively online, even going so far as to look at satellite pictures. I\u0027d finally chosen one that most resembled my vision and crossed my fingers I\u0027d have the same luck as I\u0027d had in finding Marcus\u0027s apartment. Surely the universe owed me a few favors. Unfortunately, things didn\u0027t look too promising when we finally reached the street I\u0027d been given. It was a peaceful residential area, filled with those same distinctive houses, but nothing that quite matched the one I\u0027d seen in my vision. We drove up and down the street as I scanned each side, hoping maybe I\u0027d missed something. \"Ugh,\" I said, slouching back into my seat. No luck. The universe had apparently cut me off. \"We\u0027ll have to check the other location, but seriously, it didn\u0027t look like a match.\" \"Well, it can\u0027t hurt to - \" Adrian suddenly made an abrupt turn onto a side street we\u0027d nearly driven past. I jerked upright as he clipped the curb. \"What are you doing? Think about your tires!\" \"Look.\" He made another turn, putting us on a parallel street. Most of it was contemporary California housing . . . but one block had more Victorian houses. I gasped. \"There it is!\" Adrian came to a stop on the side of the street opposite from the house of my vision. Everything was there, from the wrapping porch to the hydrangea bush. And now, in the full light of day, I could make out the sign in the front yard: OLD WORLD BED-AND-BREAKFAST. Smaller print identified it as a historic site. \"Well, there we go.\" Adrian was clearly very pleased with his find, despite the risk to the car\u0027s tires. \"Maybe Jackie\u0027s sister is staying here.\" \"Odd choice to run nefarious magical activities out of,\" I remarked. \"I don\u0027t know. Seeing as there aren\u0027t any ancient castles in the neighborhood, then why not a bed-and-breakfast?\" I took a deep breath. \"Okay, then. Let\u0027s go make some inquiries. You sure you can muddle the minds of those who see me?\" \"Easy,\" he said. \"Easier still if you were wearing your wig.\" \"Oh, shoot. I forgot.\" I ducked down and retrieved a shoulder-length brown wig that Ms. Terwilliger had supplied me with. Even with Adrian\u0027s magic, we wanted to take extra precautions. While it would be good if people were visited by an unmemorable blonde, it\u0027d be better still if they were visited by an unmemorable brunette. I tugged the wig on, hoping no one had seen my transformation. I lifted my head. \"Does it look okay?\" Adrian\u0027s face showed approval. \"It\u0027s cute. You look even brainier, which I didn\u0027t think was possible.\" We left the car, and I wondered if I wanted to look brainier. A lot of people already thought I was boring. Blond hair might be the only exciting thing I had going for me. Then I thought for a minute about my recent experience scaling a fire escape, breaking and entering, and getting into a fistfight with a fugitive. Not to mention that I was now hunting a powerful evil witch alongside a vampire who could control people\u0027s minds. Okay, maybe I wasn\u0027t so boring after all. We stepped inside to find a cute little lobby with an ornate desk and a sitting area with wicker furniture. Stuffed rabbits dressed in ball gowns adorned the shelves, and the walls actually had oil paintings of Queen Victoria. The owners apparently took their theme very literally, though I wasn\u0027t sure how the rabbits fit in. A girl my age sat at the desk and glanced up in surprise from a magazine. She had short platinum hair and hipster glasses. Tons of necklaces hung around her neck in a gaudy display that went against my minimalist sensibilities. Hot pink plastic beads, a sparkly green star, a gold and diamond locket, a dog tag . . . it was mind-boggling. Even worse, she was chewing gum loudly. \"Hi,\" she said. \"Can I help you?\" We\u0027d had a whole routine planned, but Adrian immediately went off script. He slung his arm around me. \"Yeah, we\u0027re looking for a weekend getaway, and a friend of ours swears this is top-of-the-line romance.\" He pulled me closer. \"Our anniversary\u0027s coming up. We\u0027ve been dating for one year, but man, it hardly seems like it.\" \"That\u0027s for sure,\" I said, trying to keep my jaw from dropping. I forced what I hoped was a happy smile. The girl glanced back and forth between us, her expression softening. \"That\u0027s so sweet. Congratulations.\" \"Can we check the place out?\" Adrian asked. \"I mean, if there are any vacant rooms?\" \"Sure,\" she said, standing up. She spit her gum into a trash can and walked over to us. \"I\u0027m Alicia. My aunt and uncle are the owners.\" \"Taylor,\" I said, shaking her hand. \"Jet,\" said Adrian. I nearly groaned. For inexplicable reasons, \"Jet Steele\" was a pseudonym Adrian really liked using. In our rehearsal today, he was supposed to be called Brian. Alicia glanced back and forth between us, a small frown on her face that soon smoothed out. I had to guess it was Adrian\u0027s compulsion, confusing her perceptions of us a bit. \"Follow me. We have a few vacant rooms you can see.\" With one last puzzled look at us, she turned and headed toward a stairway. \"Isn\u0027t this great, sweetie?\" Adrian asked loudly as we walked up the creaking stairs. \"I know how much you like rabbits. Didn\u0027t you have one when you were little? What was his name, Hopper?\" \"Yeah,\" I said, resisting the urge to punch him on the arm. Hopper? Really? \"Best rabbit ever.\" \"Oh, neat,\" said Alicia. \"Then I\u0027ll take you to the Bunny Suite first.\" The Bunny Suite had more of those well-dressed stuffed rabbits as part of the decor. The quilt covering the king-size bed also had a border of alternating hearts and rabbits stitched in. Several books sat on the mantel above the wood-burning fireplace, including The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Rabbit, Run. Until that moment, I hadn\u0027t realized just how absurdly far a theme could be taken. \"Wow,\" said Adrian. He sat down on the bed and tested its bounciness, giving it a nod of approval. \"This is amazing. What do you think, buttercup?\" \"I have no words,\" I said honestly. He patted the spot beside him. \"Want to try it out?\" I answered with a look and felt relieved when he stood up. Adrian and beds stirred up too many conflicting feelings in me. After that, Alicia showed us the Morning Glory Suite, the Velvet Suite, and the London Suite, all of which competed to outdo the others in tackiness. Nonetheless, despite the absurdity of Adrian\u0027s ruse, the tour had given me the opportunity to take note of the other labeled doors in the hallway. We followed Alicia back downstairs. \"We don\u0027t get to see the Sapphire Suite or the Prince Albert Suite?\" I asked. Alicia shook her head. \"Sorry. Those are occupied. I can give you a brochure with some pictures, if you want.\" Adrian had his arm around me again. \"Angel cake, wasn\u0027t the Prince Albert Suite where Veronica stayed? She\u0027s not still here, is she?\" \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I said. This, at least, was similar to what we\u0027d rehearsed. I glanced over at Alicia. \"You probably can\u0027t tell us that, huh? If our friend Veronica\u0027s here? She\u0027s really pretty, has long dark hair.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" said Alicia, brightening. \"Of course I remember her. She was in the Velvet Suite, actually, and just checked out yesterday.\" I resisted the urge to kick the desk. So close. We\u0027d missed her by a day. Yes, the universe was definitely done giving me breaks. I wouldn\u0027t be able to cast the scrying spell until the next full moon, which was a month away. \"Oh, well,\" said Adrian, still with that easy smile. \"We\u0027ll see her for Christmas anyway. Thanks for your help.\" \"Do you want to book a room?\" Alicia asked hopefully. \"We\u0027ll get back to you on that,\" I said. I actually wouldn\u0027t have put it past Adrian to book one and then claim it was part of our cover. \"We\u0027re checking out a few places. A one-year anniversary isn\u0027t something you want to make a hasty decision on.\" \"But,\" said Adrian, giving her a wink, \"I\u0027ve got a good feeling about the Bunny Suite.\" Alicia walked us out, her eyes widening when she saw the Mustang. \"Wow, nice car.\" \"It\u0027s an amazing car,\" I said. \"That\u0027s our baby - well, until we have real ones. Don\u0027t you think it needs a name?\" asked Adrian. \"I keep trying to convince Taylor.\" Once again, I had to fight the urge to punch him. \"Oh, definitely,\" said Alicia. \"That kind of car . . . it\u0027s like royalty.\" \"See?\" Adrian shot me a triumphant look. \"And Alicia\u0027s an expert on royalty. Didn\u0027t you see all those paintings?\" \"Thanks for your help,\" I told her, steering him forward. \"We\u0027ll be in touch.\" We got in the car, and after waving goodbye to Alicia, Adrian drove away. I stared blankly ahead. \"Much like with the Bunny Suite, I have no words to describe what just happened. I mean, really? Our anniversary? Jet?\" \"I look more like a Jet than a Brian,\" he argued. \"Besides, that was a much better story than the one about how we wanted to pay a surprise birthday visit to our \u0027friend\u0027 Veronica.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that. But it did give us the information we needed. Which isn\u0027t good.\" Adrian grew serious. \"Are you sure? Maybe Veronica left the area altogether. Maybe you and the other girls are out of danger.\" \"That would be good, I guess . . . except, it just means some other poor girl somewhere else would suffer instead, and we wouldn\u0027t have any way to stop it.\" From my purse, I pulled out Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s list of magic-using girls. \"One of these addresses is in Pasadena. We can at least swing through on our way back and warn her.\" The girl we sought was named Wendy Stone. She was a student at Cal Tech, which seemed like an odd vocation for a wannabe witch. Of course, Ms. Terwilliger had said these were girls who weren\u0027t actively studying the magical path. They simply possessed magical ability, and I supposed the fact that they had no mentors suggested that they might actually be resistant to their inborn abilities - kind of like me. Wendy lived in an apartment near campus that was easy to find. It was a no-nonsense, primarily student residence, but it seemed like a luxury palace after Marcus\u0027s building. As we passed busy students carrying backpacks and talking about classes, I felt a pang of longing that I hadn\u0027t experienced in a while. Inheriting the Alchemist mantle meant I couldn\u0027t go to college. College was a dream I\u0027d held on to for a long time, though enrolling at Amberwood had helped ease some of my longing. Now, in this buzz of academia, a surge of jealousy sprang up in me. What would it be like to have this kind of life? To have your days solely devoted to the pursuit of knowledge, with no intrigue or life-threatening situations? Even Adrian, with his part-time art classes, was able to have some sort of collegiate experience. \"Don\u0027t be so down,\" he said when we reached Wendy\u0027s floor. \"You might get to college someday.\" I looked over at him in wonder. \"How did you know that\u0027s what I was thinking?\" \"Because I know you,\" he said simply, no mockery in his eyes. \"Your aura got sad, and I figured being on a college campus had something to do with it.\" I couldn\u0027t meet his gaze and turned away. \"I don\u0027t like that.\" \"What, that someone actually knows what\u0027s important in your life?\" Yes, that was exactly it. But why did it bother me? Because it was Adrian, I realized. Why was it that a vampire understood me so well? Why not one of my friends? Why not one of my human friends? \"You can be Jet if you want,\" I said brusquely, trying to get us back on track and cover up my troubled feelings. After all, this wasn\u0027t Sydney\u0027s Therapy Hour. \"But we are not posing as a couple again.\" \"Are you sure?\" he said. His tone was lighter now, turning him back into the Adrian I knew. \"Because I\u0027ve got a lot more terms of endearment to use. Honey pie. Sugarplum. Bread pudding.\" \"Why are they all high-calorie foods?\" I asked. I didn\u0027t want to encourage him, but the question slipped out before I could stop it. \"And bread pudding isn\u0027t really that romantic.\" We had reached Wendy\u0027s door. \"Do you want me to call you celery stick instead?\" he asked. \"It just doesn\u0027t inspire the same warm and fuzzy feelings.\" \"I want you to call me Sydney.\" I knocked on the door. \"Er, Taylor.\" A girl with freckles and frizzy red hair answered. Her eyes narrowed warily. \"Yes?\" \"We\u0027re looking for Wendy Stone,\" I said. She scowled. \"Are you from the registrar\u0027s office? Because I told them the check\u0027s on its way.\" \"No.\" I lowered my voice and made sure there were no witnesses. \"My name\u0027s Taylor. We\u0027re here to talk to you about, um, magic.\" The transformation was sudden and startling. She went from suspicious and cautious to shocked and outraged. \"No. No. I\u0027ve told you guys a hundred times I don\u0027t want to be involved! I can\u0027t believe you\u0027d actually show up at my door to try to convert me to your little coven freak show.\" She tried to shut the door, but Adrian managed to stick his foot in and block it. Very manly. \"Wait,\" he said. \"That\u0027s not what this is about. Your life might be in danger.\" Wendy turned incredulous. \"So you guys are threatening me now?\" \"No, nothing like that. Please,\" I pleaded. \"Just let us talk to you for five minutes inside. Then we\u0027ll leave and never bother you again.\" Wendy hesitated and then finally gave a nod of resignation. \"Fine. But I\u0027m getting my pepper spray.\" Her apartment was neat and tidy, save for a pile of papers and engineering books scattered on the floor. We\u0027d apparently interrupted her homework, which brought back my wistfulness. She made good on her promise to get the pepper spray and then stood before us with crossed arms. \"Talk,\" she ordered. I showed her the picture of Veronica. \"Have you ever seen this woman?\" \"Nope.\" \"Good.\" Or was it? Did that mean Veronica might have Wendy tagged as a future hit and was waiting to pounce? \"She\u0027s dangerous. I\u0027m not exactly sure how to put it. . . .\" \"She finds girls with magic and sucks away their souls,\" supplied Adrian helpfully. Wendy did a double take. \"I\u0027m sorry, what did you say?\" \"That\u0027s not exactly the case,\" I said. \"But it\u0027s close enough. She seeks out girls with power and takes it for herself.\" \"But I don\u0027t use magic,\" Wendy countered. \"Like I told you, I don\u0027t want anything to do with it. There\u0027s a witch who lives in Anaheim who\u0027s always telling me how much potential I have and how I should be her apprentice. I keep telling her no, and I\u0027ve never even tried any spells. This soul-sucking lady has no reason to come after me.\" Ms. Terwilliger had warned me some of the girls might say this. In fact, she\u0027d said most would have this argument. \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" I said. \"That won\u0027t stop her.\" Wendy looked terrified now, and I didn\u0027t blame her. My reaction had been similar. It was frustrating to know the very thing you were trying to get away from might come after you. \"Then what should I do?\" she asked. \"Well, avoid her if you can. If she comes to see you . . . I mean, don\u0027t let her in. Don\u0027t be alone with her.\" That was slightly lame advice, and we all knew it. \"If you do see her, I\u0027d tell that witch in Anaheim. In fact . . . I know you don\u0027t want to, but if I were you, I\u0027d get in touch with that witch now and try to get her help. Maybe even learn a few defensive spells. I understand you don\u0027t want to - believe me, I really do - but it could save your life. Also . . . \" I held out the agate charm. \"You should take this and wear it at all times.\" Wendy eyed the charm as though it were a poisonous snake. \"Is this some trick to get me to learn magic after all? You come here with this whole act about how if I don\u0027t learn, I could get my soul sucked away?\" Again, I had to give her points. I would think exactly the same thing. \"We\u0027re telling the truth,\" I insisted. \"There\u0027s no proof I can offer - well, wait. Give me your email address, and I\u0027ll send you this article about another girl it happened to.\" Wendy looked like she was on the verge of using the pepper spray. \"I think I would\u0027ve heard if some girl had her soul magically sucked away.\" \"It wasn\u0027t really obvious to those who don\u0027t know about the magical world. Let me send it to you, and then you can make your own decisions. It\u0027s the best I can offer.\" She reluctantly agreed and wrote down her email address. Adrian stepped forward to take it from her, but he must have moved too quickly because she suddenly thrust the can of pepper spray in his direction. \"Stay back!\" she exclaimed. At the exact same moment, I sprang in front of him, terrified he was about to get a face full of pepper spray. I cast the first spell I could think of, a simple one that created a flashy - but harmless - show of colored light. A shielding spell would\u0027ve been much more useful, but I hadn\u0027t practiced any yet. That would have to be rectified, in case our future errands involved more pepper spray. \"You back off,\" I warned. As I\u0027d hoped, the brilliant display was terrifying to someone anti-magic like Wendy. She retreated to the far side of her apartment and thankfully didn\u0027t use the spray. \"G-get out,\" she stammered, eyes full of fear. \"Please take precautions,\" I said. I set the charm on the floor. \"And please wear this. I\u0027ll email you the article.\" \"Get out,\" she repeated, making no move toward the charm. As Adrian and I walked out of her building and into the sun, I sighed loudly. I was dismayed enough that I didn\u0027t even have the chance to feel down about being at a college. \"That didn\u0027t go so well,\" I said. He thought about it, then grinned. \"I don\u0027t know, Sage. You threw yourself in the line of pepper spray for me. You must like me just a little bit.\" \"I - I figured it\u0027d be a shame to ruin your pretty face,\" I stammered. In truth, I hadn\u0027t been thinking of anything that specific. All I\u0027d known was that Adrian was in danger. Protecting him had been instinctual. \"Still, that spell was kind of badass.\" I managed a small smile. \"It was harmless, and that\u0027s the thing. Wendy didn\u0027t know any better. The reason Veronica goes after these girls is that they don\u0027t have any magical protection - and that\u0027s exactly why they probably can\u0027t stop her. I don\u0027t think pepper spray will help, but maybe the article will convince her. Oh, shoot. I\u0027ll have to make a fake email address for Taylor.\" \"No worries,\" said Adrian. \"I already have a Jet Steele one you can use.\" This actually made me laugh. \"Of course you do. For all the online dating you do, right?\" Adrian didn\u0027t comment one way or the other, which bothered me more than it should have. I\u0027d meant it as a joke . . . but was there truth to it? If rumors - and some of my own observations - were true, Adrian had experience with a lot of women. A lot. Thinking of him with others upset me, far more than it should have. How many other girls had he kissed with that same intensity? How many had been in his bed? How many had felt his hands upon their bodies? He couldn\u0027t have loved them all. Some - probably most - had been conquests, girls whose faces he forgot the next morning. For all I knew, I was just the ultimate conquest for him, a test for his skills. You probably couldn\u0027t find a greater challenge than a human with hang-ups about vampires. And yet, thinking back on all the things said and unsaid between us, I was pretty sure that wasn\u0027t true. No matter how crazy this romantic entanglement was, he loved me - or thought he did. I was no superficial conquest. It\u0027d probably be better if I was, though. Without an emotional connection, he\u0027d eventually give up and easily find comfort in someone else\u0027s arms. This would probably be a good time for me to suggest he do that anyway. But I stayed silent.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-9.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
