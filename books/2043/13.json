{"id":109603,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"WADE TOLD ME EVERYTHING he knew. It was all useful, but I didn\u0027t know if it would be enough. First, I had to get to St. Louis . . . and that was going to be tricky. I braced myself for the phone calls I\u0027d have to make, hoping I had enough Alchemist wiles to pull them off. Before I took on that task, I just wanted the normality and comfort of my own room. Eddie and I drove back to Amberwood, analyzing every detail of our meeting. He was chomping at the bit to make progress, and I promised I\u0027d keep him in the loop. I had just reached my door when my phone rang. It was Ms. Terwilliger. I swear, sometimes I thought she had a sensor outside my room so that she\u0027d know the instant I returned. \"Miss Melbourne,\" she said. \"We need to meet.\" My heart stopped. \"There hasn\u0027t been another victim, has there? You said we have time.\" \"We do,\" she replied. \"Which is why we need to meet sooner rather than later. Reading up on spells is one thing, but you require some hands-on practice. I refuse to let Veronica get to you.\" Her words triggered a mix of emotions. Naturally, I had my knee-jerk reaction against practicing magic. It was quickly squashed by the realization that Ms. Terwilliger cared about me and was so concerned about keeping me safe. My own personal desire to not be in a coma was also a strong motivator. \"When do you want to meet, ma\u0027am?\" I asked. \"Tomorrow morning.\" I realized tomorrow was Saturday. Already? Where had the week gone? I was driving Adrian to pick up his car in the morning, which hopefully wouldn\u0027t take a long time. \"Could we meet at noon? I\u0027ve got an errand to run.\" \"I suppose so,\" said Ms. Terwilliger, with some reluctance. \"Meet me at my place, and then we\u0027ll go out to Lone Rock Park.\" I was about to lie back on my bed and froze. \"Why do we have to go out to the middle of the desert?\" Lone Rock Park was remote and rarely saw many tourists. I hadn\u0027t forgotten how terrifying it was the last time she\u0027d brought me out into the wilderness. At least this time we\u0027d be in daylight. \"Well, we can hardly practice on school grounds,\" she pointed out \"True. . . .\" \"Bring your book, and the components you\u0027ve been working on.\" We disconnected, and I jotted out a quick text to Adrian: Need to be fast tomorrow. Meeting Ms. T at 12. His response wasn\u0027t entirely unexpected: Why? Adrian naturally needed to know everything that was going on in my life. I texted back that Ms. Terwilliger wanted to work on magical protection. This time, he did surprise me: Can I watch? Wanna know how she\u0027s protecting you. Wow, Adrian actually asked? He had a history of simply inviting himself along on outings. I hesitated, still confused after our heated moment at the sorority. He\u0027d never mentioned it again, though, and his concern now touched me. I texted back that he could come along and was rewarded with a smiley face. I didn\u0027t entirely know what to wear to \"magical training,\" so I opted for comfortable layers the next morning. Adrian gave me a once-over when he got into Latte. \"Casual mode, huh? Haven\u0027t seen that since the Wolfe days.\" \"I don\u0027t know what she has in mind,\" I explained, doing a U-turn on his street. \"Figured this was best.\" \"You could have worn your AYE shirt.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t want to get it dirty,\" I said, grinning. That was partially true. I still thought the fiery heart he\u0027d painted was exquisite. But each time I looked at the shirt, too many memories seized me. What had I been thinking? That was a question I\u0027d asked myself a hundred times, and every answer I came up with sounded fake. My preferred theory was that I\u0027d simply been caught up in how serious Adrian had been about his art, how the emotion and passion had seized hold of him. Girls liked artists just as much as bad boys, right? Even now, something stirred in my chest when I thought about the enraptured look on his face. I loved that he possessed something so powerful in him. But, as I told myself constantly, that was no excuse for climbing all over him and letting him kiss me - on my neck. I\u0027d bought and downloaded the \"bad boy\" book online, but it had been completely useless in advising me. I finally decided the best way - if not the healthiest one - was to act like the moment had never happened. That didn\u0027t mean I forgot it. In fact, as I sat beside him in the car, I had a difficult time not thinking about how it had felt to be pressed up against him. Or how his fingers had felt entangled in my hair. Or how his lips had - Sydney! Stop. Think of something else. Conjugate Latin verbs. Recite the periodic table. None of those did any good. To Adrian\u0027s credit, he continued to withhold any commentary about that night. Finally, I found distraction in telling him about my trip to San Bernardino. Rehashing the conspiracy, rebel groups, and break-ins pretty much killed any passionate feelings I still had. Adrian didn\u0027t like the idea of Alchemists working with Warriors or of the tattoo controlling me. But he also didn\u0027t like me walking into danger. I tried to downplay the near impossibility of breaking into the St. Louis facility, but he clearly didn\u0027t believe me. Ms. Terwilliger texted me twice not to be late to our meeting. I kept an eye on my watch, but the care of a Mustang was not something I took lightly, and I had to take my time at the mechanic\u0027s shop to make sure the Mustang was in pristine condition. Adrian had wanted to go with basic tires, but I\u0027d urged him to upgrade, convincing him the extra cost would be worth it. And once I inspected them, I congratulated myself on the choice. Only after I was satisfied the car hadn\u0027t been unnecessarily scratched did I finally allow him to pay. We drove both cars back to Vista Azul, and I was pleased to see my timing was perfect. We weren\u0027t late, but Ms. Terwilliger was waiting on her porch for us. We designated Adrian as our carpool driver. \"Jeez,\" I said when she hurriedly got in the car. \"Do you have somewhere to be after this?\" The smile she gave me was strained, and I couldn\u0027t help but notice how pale she looked. \"No, but we do have a schedule to follow. I cast a large spell this morning that won\u0027t last forever. The countdown is on.\" She wouldn\u0027t say any more until we reached the park, and that silence unnerved me. It gave me the opportunity to imagine all sorts of frightening outcomes. And although I trusted her, I suddenly felt relieved that Adrian was along as a chaperone. Although it wasn\u0027t the busiest place, Lone Rock Park still had the occasional hiker. Ms. Terwilliger - who was actually in hiking boots - set off across the rocky terrain, searching for a suitably remote space to do whatever it was she had in mind. A few stratified rock formations dotted the landscape, but I couldn\u0027t really appreciate their beauty. Mostly I was aware that we were out here when the sun was at its fiercest. Even if it was almost winter, we\u0027d still be feeling the heat. I glanced over at Adrian as we walked and found him already looking at me. From his jacket pocket, he produced a bottle of sunscreen. \"I knew you\u0027d ask. I\u0027m nearly as prepared as you are.\" \"Nearly,\" I said. He\u0027d done it again, anticipating my thoughts. For half a heartbeat, I pretended it was just the two of us out on a pleasant afternoon hike. It seemed like most of the time we spent together was on some urgent mission. How nice would it be to just hang out without the weight of the world on us? Ms. Terwilliger soon brought us back to our grim reality. \"This should do,\" she said, surveying the land around her. She had managed to find one of the most desolate areas in the park. I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised to see vultures circling overhead. \"Did you bring what I asked for?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" I knelt on the ground and rifled through my bag. In it was the spell book, along with some herbal and liquid compounds I\u0027d mixed up at her request. \"Take out the fireball kindling,\" she instructed. Adrian\u0027s eyes went wide. \"Did you just say \u0027fireball\u0027? That\u0027s badass.\" \"You see fire all the time,\" I reminded him. \"From Moroi who can wield it.\" \"Yeah, but I\u0027ve never seen a human do anything like that. I\u0027ve never seen you do anything like that.\" I wished he didn\u0027t look so awestruck because it kind of drove home the severity of what we were about to attempt. I would\u0027ve felt better if he\u0027d treated it like it was no big deal. But this spell? Yeah, it was kind of a big deal. I\u0027d once performed another spell that involved throwing a painstakingly made amulet and reciting words that made it burst into flames. That one had a huge physical component, however. This spell was another of those mental ones and essentially involved summoning fire out of thin air. The kindling Ms. Terwilliger had referred to was a small drawstring bag filled with ashes made from burnt yew bark. She took the bag from me and examined its contents, murmuring in approval. \"Yes, yes. Very nice. Excellent consistency. You burned it for exactly the right amount of time.\" She handed the bag back. \"Now, eventually you won\u0027t need this. That\u0027s what makes this spell so powerful. It can be performed very quickly, with very little preparation. But you have to practice first before you can reach that point.\" I nodded along and tried to stay in student mode. So far, what she was saying was similar to what the book had described. If I thought of all this as a classroom exercise, it was much less daunting. Not really scary at all. Ms. Terwilliger tilted her head and looked past me. \"Adrian? You might want to keep your distance. A considerable distance.\" Okay. Maybe a little scary. He obeyed and backed up. Ms. Terwilliger apparently had no such fear for herself because she stayed only a few feet away from me. \"Now then,\" she said. \"Apply the ashes, and hold out your hand.\" I reached into the bag, touching the ashes with my thumb and forefinger. Then I lightly rubbed all my fingers together until my whole palm had a fine gray coating on it. I set the bag down and then held out my hand in front of me, palm up. I knew what came next but waited for her instruction. \"Summon your magic to call the flame back from the ashes. No incantation, just your will.\" Magic surged within me. Calling an element from the world reminded me a little of what the Moroi did, which felt strange. My attempt started off as a red glimmer, hovering in the air above my palm. Slowly, it grew and grew until it was about the size of a tennis ball. The high of magic filled me. I held my breath, scarcely able to believe what I had just done. The red flames writhed and swirled, and although I could feel their heat, they didn\u0027t burn me. Ms. Terwilliger gave a grunt that seemed to be equal parts amusement and surprise. \"Remarkable. I forget sometimes what a natural you really are. It\u0027s only red, but something tells me, it won\u0027t take long before you can produce blue ones without the ashes. Calling elements out of the air is easier than trying to transform one substance into another.\" I stared at the fireball, entranced, but soon found myself getting tired. The flames flickered, shrank, and then faded away altogether. \"The sooner you get rid of it, the better,\" she told me. \"You\u0027ll just use up your own energy trying to sustain it. Best to throw it at your adversary and quickly summon another. Try again, and this time, throw it.\" I called the fire once more and felt a small bit of satisfaction at seeing it take on more of an orange hue. I\u0027d learned in my very first childhood chemistry lessons that the lighter a flame was, the hotter it burned. Getting to blue anytime soon still seemed like a long shot. And speaking of long shots . . . I threw the fireball. Or, well, I tried. My control of it faltered when I attempted to send it off toward a bare patch of ground. The fireball splintered apart, the flames disappearing into smoke that was carried off by the wind. \"It\u0027s hard,\" I said, knowing how lame that sounded. \"Trying to hold it and throw it is just like an ordinary physical thing. I have to do that while still controlling the magic.\" \"Exactly.\" Ms. Terwilliger seemed very pleased. \"And that\u0027s where the practice comes in.\" Fortunately, it didn\u0027t take too many attempts before I figured out how to make it all work together. Adrian cheered me on when I successfully managed to throw my first fireball, resulting in a beautiful shot that perfectly hit the rock I\u0027d been aiming for. I flashed Ms. Terwilliger a triumphant look and waited for the next spell we\u0027d be moving on to. To my surprise, she didn\u0027t seem nearly as impressed as I expected her to be. \"Do it again,\" she said. \"But I\u0027ve got it down,\" I protested. \"We should try something else. I was reading the other part of the book - \" \"You have no business doing that yet,\" she scolded. \"You think this is exhausting? You\u0027d pass out attempting one of the more advanced spells. Now.\" She pointed at the hard desert floor. \"Again.\" I wanted to tell her that it was impossible for me not to read ahead in a book. It was just how I operated with all my classes. Something told me now was not the best time to bring that up. She made me practice the throw over and over. Once she was convinced I had it down, she had me work on increasing the fire\u0027s heat. I finally managed to get up to yellow but could go no farther. Then I had to work on casting the spell without the ashes. Once I reached that milestone, it was back to practicing the throws. She picked various targets for me, and I hit them all effortlessly. \"Just like Skee-Ball,\" I muttered. \"Easy and boring.\" \"Yes,\" Ms. Terwilliger agreed. \"It\u0027s easy hitting inanimate objects. But moving targets? Living targets? Not quite so easy. So, let\u0027s move on to that, shall we?\" The fireball I\u0027d been holding above my hand vanished as shock shattered my control. \"What do you mean?\" If she expected me to start aiming at birds or rodents, she was in for a rude awakening. There was no way I was going to incinerate something alive. \"What am I supposed to hit?\" Ms. Terwilliger pushed her glasses up her nose and backed up several feet. \"Me.\" I waited for the punch line or at least some further explanation, but none came. I glanced behind me at Adrian, hoping perhaps he might shed some light on this, but he looked as astounded as I felt. I turned back to the singed ground where my earlier fireballs had struck. \"Ms. Terwilliger, you can\u0027t ask me to hit you.\" Her lips twitched into a small half smile. \"I assure you, I can. Go ahead, you can\u0027t hurt me.\" I had to think a few moments for how to phrase my next response. \"I\u0027m a pretty good shot, ma\u0027am. I can hit you.\" This earned an outright laugh. \"Hit, yes. Hurt, no. Go ahead and throw. Our time is running out.\" I didn\u0027t know how much time had passed exactly, but the sun was definitely lower in the sky. I looked back at Adrian, silently asking for help in dealing with this insanity. His only response was a shrug. \"You\u0027re a witness to this,\" I told him. \"You heard her tell me to do it.\" He nodded. \"You\u0027re totally blameless.\" I took a deep breath and summoned my next fireball. I was so frazzled that it started off red, and I had to work to heat it up. Then I looked up at Ms. Terwilliger and braced myself for the shot. It was more difficult than I expected - and not just because I was worried about hurting her. Throwing something at the ground required almost no thought. The focus there was on aim and little else. But facing a person, seeing her eyes and the way her chest rose and fell while breathing . . . well, she was right. It was entirely different from hitting an inanimate object. I began to tremble, unsure if I could do it. \"You\u0027re wasting time,\" she warned. \"You\u0027re sapping energy again. Throw.\" The command in her voice jolted me to action. I threw. The fireball flew from my hand, straight at her - but it never made contact. I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes. About a foot in front of her, it hit some kind of invisible barrier, smashing apart into small flames, which quickly dissipated into smoke. My jaw dropped. \"What is that?\" I exclaimed. \"A very, very powerful shielding spell,\" she said, clearly enjoying my reaction. She lifted up a pendant that had been hanging under her shirt. It didn\u0027t look like anything special, just a piece of unpolished carnelian wrapped in silver wire. \"It took incredible effort to make this . . . and requires more effort still in order to maintain it. The result is an invisible shield - as you can see - that\u0027s impervious to most physical and magical attacks.\" Adrian was by my side in a flash. \"Hang on. There\u0027s a spell that makes you invulnerable to everything, and you only now just thought to mention it? You\u0027ve been going on this whole time about how Sydney\u0027s in danger! Why don\u0027t you just teach her this one? Then your sister can\u0027t touch her.\" Although it didn\u0027t seem like Adrian was about to attack her as he had Marcus, he was almost just as upset. His face was flushed, his eyes hard. He had clenched his fists at his side, but I didn\u0027t even think he noticed. It was more of that primal instinct. Ms. Terwilliger remained strong in the face of his outrage. \"If it were that simple, then believe me, I would. Unfortunately, there are a number of problems. One is that Sydney, prodigy that she is, is nowhere near strong enough to cast this. I\u0027m hardly strong enough. The other problem is that it has an extremely short time frame, which is why I\u0027ve been so adamant about a schedule. It only lasts six hours and requires so much effort that you can\u0027t just cast it and permanently keep it on you at all times. I\u0027m already worn out and will be even more so once it fades. I won\u0027t be able to cast it - or hardly any other magic - for at least another day. That\u0027s why I need Sydney to be prepared at all times.\" Neither Adrian nor I said anything right away. I\u0027d taken note of her weary state when she got in the car but hadn\u0027t thought much more about it. As we\u0027d continued to practice out here, I\u0027d observed her sweating and looking more fatigued, but I\u0027d written it off to the heat. Only now could I fully appreciate the extent of what she had done. \"Why would you go to so much effort?\" I asked. \"To keep you alive,\" she snapped. \"Now, don\u0027t make this a waste. We\u0027ve only got one more hour before it wears off, and you need to be able to aim at someone without thinking twice. You hesitate too much.\" She was right. Even knowing that she was invulnerable, I still had a difficult time attacking her. Violence just wasn\u0027t something I embraced. I had to push down all my inner worries and treat it exactly like Skee-Ball. Aim, throw. Aim, throw. Don\u0027t think. Soon, I was able to fight past my anxieties and throw without hesitation. She even tried moving around a little, just to give me a better feel for what it\u0027d be like with a real foe, but I didn\u0027t find it to be much of a challenge. She was simply too tired and unable to run around or dodge me. I actually started to feel bad for her. She looked like she was about ready to pass out, and I felt guilty sizing up my next shot and - \"Ahh!\" Fire arced from Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s fingertips just as I released my fireball. My shot went wide, the ball disintegrating before it got anywhere near her. The fire she\u0027d released passed me, about a foot away. With a weary grin, she sank to her knees and exhaled. \"Class dismissed,\" she said. \"What was that?\" I asked. \"I don\u0027t have a magic shield on me!\" She didn\u0027t display my same concern. \"It was nowhere near you. I made sure of that. It was simply to prove that no matter how \u0027boring and easy\u0027 this seems, all bets are off when someone is actually attacking you. Now then. Adrian, would you be kind enough to bring me my bag? I have some dried dates in there that I think both Sydney and I would appreciate right about now.\" She was right. I\u0027d been so caught up in the lesson that I hadn\u0027t noticed how exhausted I had become. She was in worse shape, but the magic had definitely taken its toll on me. I\u0027d never worked with amounts this big for so long, and my body felt weak and drained as the usual blood sugar drop occurred. I began to understand why she kept warning me away from the really difficult stuff. I practically inhaled the dried dates she\u0027d brought for us, and although the sugar helped, I was desperate for more. Adrian gallantly helped us both walk back to the parking lot at the park\u0027s entrance, keeping one of us on each arm. \"Too bad we\u0027re out in the middle of nowhere,\" I grumbled, once we were all in Adrian\u0027s car. \"I think you\u0027d be amazed at how much I could eat right now. I\u0027ll probably faint before we\u0027re back to some civilization and restaurants.\" \"Actually,\" said Adrian. \"You might be in luck. I think I saw a place not far from here when we were driving in.\" I hadn\u0027t noticed anything, but I\u0027d been too preoccupied worrying about Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s upcoming lesson. Five minutes after we were back on the highway, I saw that Adrian was right about a restaurant. He exited onto a drab little road, pulling into the gravel parking lot of a small but freshly painted white building. I stared at the sign out front in disbelief. \"Pies and Stuff?\" \"You wanted sugar,\" Adrian reminded me. The Mustang kicked up dust and gravel, and I winced on behalf of the car. \"And at least it\u0027s not Pies and Bait or anything like that.\" \"Yeah, but the \u0027Stuff\u0027 part isn\u0027t exactly reassuring.\" \"I thought it was more the \u0027Pie\u0027 part that had you upset.\" Despite my misgivings, Pies and Stuff was actually a cute and clean little establishment. Polka-dot curtains hung in the windows, and the display case was filled with every pie imaginable as well as \"stuff\" like carrot cake and brownies. We were the only people under sixty in the whole place. We ordered our pie and sat down with it in a corner booth. I ordered peach, Adrian had French silk, and Ms. Terwilliger went with pecan. And of course, she and I had the waitress bring us coffee as soon as humanly possible since we\u0027d had to abstain, painfully, for the magic. I took a sip and immediately felt better. Adrian ate his slice at a reasonable rate, like a normal person, but Ms. Terwilliger and I dug in as though we hadn\u0027t eaten in a month. Conversation was irrelevant. Only pie mattered. Adrian regarded us both with delight and didn\u0027t try to interrupt until we\u0027d practically licked the plates clean. He nodded toward mine. \"Another piece?\" \"I\u0027ll take more coffee.\" I eyed the sparkling plate and couldn\u0027t help but notice that inner voice that used to nag me about calories was quiet these days. In fact, it didn\u0027t seem to be around anymore at all. I\u0027d been so angry about Adrian\u0027s food \"intervention,\" but his words had ended up having a bigger impact than I\u0027d expected. Not that it had anything to do with him personally, of course. Lightening up my dieting restrictions was just a reasonable idea. That was it. \"I feel pretty good now.\" \"I\u0027ll get you another cup,\" he told me. When he returned, he even had a mug for Ms. Terwilliger. \"Figured you\u0027d want one too.\" She smiled in appreciation. \"Thank you. You\u0027re very astute.\" As she drank, I couldn\u0027t help but notice she still looked tired, despite the fact that we\u0027d just replenished with sugar. She no longer seemed in danger of passing out, but it was obvious she hadn\u0027t recovered as quickly as I had. \"Are you sure you\u0027re okay?\" I asked her. \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be fine.\" She sipped more coffee, her face lost in thought. \"It\u0027s been years since I performed the shield spell. I forgot how much it takes out of me.\" I was again struck by all the trouble she\u0027d gone through for me. Ever since she\u0027d identified me as a potential magic user, I\u0027d done nothing but resist her and even be antagonistic. \"Thanks,\" I told her. \"For everything . . . I wish there was a way I could make it up to you.\" She set her cup down and stirred in more sugar. \"I\u0027m happy to do it. There\u0027s no need to reciprocate. Although . . . once this is all over, I\u0027d like very much if you\u0027d meet my coven. I\u0027m not asking you to join,\" she added quickly. \"Just to talk. I think you\u0027d find the Stelle very interesting.\" \"Stelle,\" I repeated. She\u0027d never called them by name before. \"The stars.\" Ms. Terwilliger nodded. \"Yes. Our origins are Italian, though as you\u0027ve seen already the magic we use comes from a number of cultures.\" I was at a loss for words. She\u0027d gone to so much trouble for me . . . surely it wasn\u0027t a big deal just to talk to the other witches, right? But if it was such a small thing, then why was I terrified? The answer came to me a few moments later. Talking to others, seeing the larger organization, would kick my involvement with magic up to the next level. It had taken me a long time to come around to the magic I already used. I\u0027d overcome many of my fears, but some part of me treated it as just some sideline activity. Like a hobby. Meeting other witches would change everything. I would have to accept that I was part of something so much bigger than just the occasional dabbling. Meeting a coven seemed official. And I didn\u0027t know if I was ready to be considered a witch. \"I\u0027ll think about it,\" I said at last. I wished I could give her more, but my protective instincts had seized me \"I\u0027ll take what I can get,\" she said with a small smile. Her phone chimed, and she glanced down. \"Speaking of the Stelle, I need to talk to one of my sisters. I\u0027ll meet you at the car.\" She finished her coffee and headed outside. Adrian and I followed a few minutes later. I was still troubled about the coven and caught hold of his sleeve to keep him back. I spoke softly. \"Adrian, when did I reach this point? Trying to crack open the Alchemists and practicing magic in the desert?\" Last summer, when I\u0027d been with Rose in Russia, I couldn\u0027t even tolerate the idea of sleeping in the same room with her. I\u0027d had too many Alchemist mantras running through my mind, warning me of vampire evils. And now, here I was, in league with vampires and questioning the Alchemists. That girl in Russia had nothing in common with the one in Palm Springs. No, I\u0027m still the same person at heart. I had to be . . . because if I wasn\u0027t, then who was I? Adrian smiled at me sympathetically. \"I think it\u0027s been a culmination of things. Your curious nature. Your need to do the right thing. It\u0027s all led you to this point. I know the Alchemists have taught you to think a certain way, but what you\u0027re doing now - it\u0027s not wrong.\" I raked my hand through my hair. \"And yet, despite all of that, I can\u0027t bring myself to have one tiny conversation with Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s coven.\" \"You have boundaries.\" He gently smoothed one of my wayward locks. \"Nothing wrong with that.\" \"Marcus would say it\u0027s the tattoo holding me back.\" Adrian dropped his hand. \"Marcus says a lot of things.\" \"I don\u0027t think Marcus is trying to deceive me. He believes in his cause, and I\u0027m still worried about mind control . . . but honestly, it\u0027s hard to believe I\u0027m being held back when I\u0027m out here doing stuff like this.\" I gestured outside, to where Ms. Terwilliger was. \"Alchemist dogma says this magic is unnatural and wrong.\" Adrian\u0027s smile returned. \"If it makes you feel better, you actually looked natural out there - back in the park.\" \"Doing . . . what? Throwing fireballs?\" I shook my head. \"There\u0027s nothing natural about that.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t think so, but . . . well. You were . . . amazing, throwing that fire like some kind of ancient warrior goddess.\" Annoyed, I turned away. \"Stop making fun of me.\" He caught my arm and pulled me back toward him. \"I am absolutely serious.\" I swallowed, speechless for a moment. All I was aware of was how close we were, that he was holding me to him with only a few inches between us. Almost as close as at the sorority. \"I\u0027m not a warrior or a goddess,\" I managed at last. Adrian leaned closer. \"As far as I\u0027m concerned, you\u0027re both.\" I knew that look in his eyes. I knew because I\u0027d seen it before. I expected him to kiss me, but instead, he ran his finger along the side of my neck. \"There it is, huh? Badge of honor.\" It took me a moment to realize he was talking about the hickey It had faded but wasn\u0027t entirely gone. I pulled away. \"It is not! It was a mistake. You were out of line doing that to me.\" His eyebrows rose. \"Sage, I distinctly remember every part of that night. You didn\u0027t seem that unwilling. You were practically on top of me.\" \"I don\u0027t really remember the details,\" I lied. He moved his hand from my neck and rested a fingertip on my lips. \"But I\u0027ll stick to just kissing these if it makes you feel better. No mark.\" He started to lean toward me, and I jerked away. \"You will not! It\u0027s wrong.\" \"What, kissing you, or kissing you in Pies and Stuff?\" I glanced around, suddenly aware that we were creating a dinner show for the senior citizens, even if they couldn\u0027t hear us. I backed up. \"Both,\" I said, feeling my cheeks burn. \"If you\u0027re going to attempt something inappropriate - something you said you wouldn\u0027t do anymore - then you could at least pick a better place.\" He laughed softly, and the look in his eyes confused me further. \"Okay\" he said. \"The next time I kiss you, I promise it\u0027ll be in a more romantic place.\" \"I - what? No! You shouldn\u0027t try at all!\" I began moving toward the door, and he fell in step with me. \"What happened to loving me from a distance? What happened to not, um, bringing up any of this stuff?\" For someone who was allegedly just going to watch from afar, he wasn\u0027t doing a very good job. And I was doing an even worse job of being indifferent. He moved in front of the door and blocked my way. \"I said I wouldn\u0027t - if you don\u0027t want me to. But you\u0027re kind of giving me mixed signals, Sage.\" \"I am not,\" I said, amazed that I could even say that with a straight face. Even I didn\u0027t believe it. \"You\u0027re presumptuous and arrogant and a whole lot of other things if you think I\u0027ve changed my mind.\" \"You see, that\u0027s just it.\" There he was again, moving into my space. \"I think you like the \u0027other things.\u0027\" I shook off my daze and pulled away. \"I like humans.\" Another Alchemist lesson came to mind. They look like us, but don\u0027t be deceived. The Moroi don\u0027t display the malice of the Strigoi, but creatures who drink blood and manipulate nature have no place in our world. Work with them only as you must. We are not the same. Keep your distance as much as possible. It\u0027s for the good of your soul. Adrian didn\u0027t look like he believed this either, but he stepped away and headed outside. I followed a few moments later, thinking I\u0027d played with fire more than once today.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-indigo-spell-bloodlines-3/page-13.html","bookId":2043,"book":{"id":2043,"title":"The Indigo Spell (Bloodlines #3)","description":"Storyline: Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.
