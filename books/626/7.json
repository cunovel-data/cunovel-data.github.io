{"id":15475,"no":7,"title":"7. Freedom 自由","content":"Myron crumbled a cracker on the windowsill next to his desk, then looked away. He knew Oddty came only when nobody was looking and ate the crumbs. Myron watched him out of the corner of his eye. He was a black bird with a pink breast. Myron had named him \"Oddly.\" Myron had named him Oddty. Is that your dumb bird again?\" asked Kathy No, said Myron. \"Oddly is not my bird. I don\u0027t 36 own him. He doesn\u0027t live in a cage. Oddly is free!\" \"You\u0027re a birdbrain,\" said Kathy. Myron watched Oddly fly away. It made him sad and glad at the same time. He wished he could fly away across the sky with Oddly. Oddly probably thinks I live in a cage, he realized. Whenever he sees me, I\u0027m sitting in this same desk. He probably thinks this desk is my cage! So Myron got out of his chair and sat on the floor. \"Myron, what are you doing out of your seat?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"I want to sit on the floor,\" said Myron. Several kids laughed. \"Get back in your seat,\" ordered Mrs. Jewls. Myron reluctantly returned to his desk. I do live in a cage, he thought. I\u0027m not allowed out. I have to stay in my cage until the bell rings. Then I have to go down the stairs. Then when it rings again, I have to go up the stairs. Then when it rings again, I have to go down the stairs. Then when it rings again, I have to go up the stairs. I\u0027m never free. The bell rang. Myron went down the stairs. It was so crowded with kids rushing to recess that he couldn\u0027t stop if he wanted. It was as if someone had lifted his cage and was carrying him down the stairs. The bell rang again. 37 Myron went up the stairs. At lunch the bell rang again. Myron went down the stairs. After lunch the bell rang again. Myron stood at the bottom of the staircase and looked up. \"No!\" he declared. \"I won\u0027t go. I have to be free!\" As all the other kids rushed past him, he eased his way around to the back of the stairs. As everybody else went up, Myron went down . . . to the basement. He nervously walked down the old creaky staircase. He didn\u0027t know what he\u0027d find, or what would find him. He had heard that dead rats were living down there, or worse, maybe even Mrs. Gorf! Mrs. Gorf was the meanest teacher Myron had ever had. She used to be the teacher on the thirtieth story, before Mrs. Jewls took over. But nobody believed that Mrs. Gorf was really gone. Everyone said she was still lurking somewhere inside Wayside School. He stepped off the last step, at the very bottom of Wayside School. It was too dark to see. Somewhere he heard a drip that echoed all around the cold and damp room. With his arms outstretched, he stepped across the gritty floor. His hand struck against a large, fat pipe 38 above his head. The pipe felt like it was covered with a thousand spiderwebs. Still, Myron kept his finger on the pipe as he walked, so he wouldn\u0027t get lost. As long as he stayed with the pipe, he knew he\u0027d be able to find his way back to the stairs. Something crawled across his hand. He shook it off, then continued walking. He thought he heard footsteps behind him. He stopped walking. The sound of the footsteps continued for a second, then stopped. He started again, then stopped. The footsteps stopped a few seconds later. He wasn\u0027t alone. It was too dark for Myron to see who was following him, but he realized that meant that the person couldn\u0027t see him either. Whoever was coming after him had to have been following along the pipe, too. So Myron left the safety of the pipe and headed blindly across the basement. The footsteps continued behind him. He stopped. The footsteps stopped too. He bent down, then untied and took off his right sneaker. He threw it toward the other side of the basement. He heard it hit on the floor, then the footsteps started after it. Very quietly, he took off his other sneaker and threw it in the same direction. He never heard his shoe hit the ground. 39 The footsteps started after him again. He started to run, but slipped in his socked feet on a spot of slime. His hands hit loud and hard as he fell on the cold floor. The footsteps came hurriedly toward him. He held his breath and tried to be as quiet as possible. A light turned on above his head. He screamed. \"I believe this is yours,\" said a bald man. He was holding Myron\u0027s left sneaker. Next to him were two men with black mustaches. One of the men held a black attache case. Myron shook his head. \"That\u0027s not my shoe,\" he said. \"I never saw it before.\" The bald man glanced at Myron\u0027s shoeless feet. \"What\u0027s your name?\" asked the man with the attache case. \"Myron,\" said Myron. He regretted it as soon as he had said it. He wished he had made up a fake name. The man opened his attache case and took out a notebook. \"Myron,\" he repeated, as he thumbed through the notebook. \"You\u0027re supposed to be in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class, at the desk next to the window, in front of Sharie.\" \"What are you doing out of your cage-I mean, seat?\" asked the other man with a mustache. \"I just wanted to be free,\" chirped Myron. \"Please 40 don\u0027t hurt me. If you let me go back to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room, 111 never come down here again.\" \"Well, do you want to be free, or do you want to be safe?\" asked the bald man. \"Huh?\" asked Myron. \"You can\u0027t have it both ways,\" said the bald man. \"Do you want to be safe?\" asked one of the men with a mustache. \"Do you want to sit in the same chair every day, and go up and down the stairs every time the bell rings?\" \"You 11 have go to school five days a week,\" said the other man with a mustache. \"And you\u0027ll have to go to bed at the same time every day.\" \"But first you\u0027ll have to brush your teeth,\" said the other man with a mustache. \"And you won\u0027t be allowed to watch TV until you finish your homework,\" said the other man with a mustache. \"You\u0027ll have to go inside when it rains,\" said the other man with a mustache. \"But first you\u0027ll have to wipe your feet,\" said the other man with a mustache. \"Or you can be free,\" said the bald man. The man took a pencil and a piece of paper out of his attache case. \"So do you want to be safe, or do you want to be free?\" Myron looked at the three men. \"I want to be free,\" he said bravely. The man with the attache case wrote something 41 on the piece of paper and gave it to Myron. \"Sign here,\" he said. Myron couldn\u0027t read the piece of paper. It was written in some kind of foreign language. He signed his name. The man took the paper and pencil from Myron and put them back into his attache case. \"Okay, you\u0027re free,\" he said. \"Good luck, Myron,\" said the bald man. \"Here, I think you 11 need this.\" He gave Myron his left sneaker, then reached up and pulled the chain. The light turned off. Myron found himself alone in the darkness. He put his shoe back on, then hopped across the basement floor. He had no idea how to get back. At last his hand hit against a pipe. But he still didn\u0027t know which way to follow it, left or right. He didn\u0027t even know if it was the right pipe. He turned left and continued hopping, keeping his finger on the pipe. He was just about ready to turn around and try the other way when he nearly fell over the bottom stair. He hopped up the stairs, and continued hopping all the way up to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room. He was tired, sore, and dirty. \"You\u0027re late, Myron,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Go write your name under DISCIPLINE, then return to your seat for the arithmetic test.\" 42 But Myron didn\u0027t feel like taking an arithmetic test. And he definitely didn\u0027t want to write his name on the board. So he sat on the floor. And there was nothing Mrs. Jewls could do about it. He was free. After school Mrs. Jewls found Myron\u0027s other sneaker in the teachers\u0027 lounge, in the refrigerator.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56864.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
