{"id":15471,"no":3,"title":"3. Bebe\u0027s Baby Brother 比比的小弟弟","content":"Mrs. Jewls asked Dameon to pass back the homework. \n \n Bebe Gunn waited nervously. Except for art, her grades had not been very good lately. If she didn\u0027t start bringing home better grades, her parents said they wouldn\u0027t let her stay up past midnight. She did her best artwork after midnight. \n \n Dameon handed Calvin his homework, then Todd, then Joy. \n \n \"Where\u0027s yours?\" asked Calvin. \n \n 13 \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Bebe. \n \n \"Did you do it?\" asked Calvin. \n \n \"Yes, I did it,\" said Bebe. \"I worked extra hard on it! I hope Mrs. Jewls didn\u0027t lose it.\" \n \n Dameon finished passing out the homework. Bebe never got hers. \n \n \"Bebe, will you come here, please,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n She pushed out of her seat, stood up, and nervously walked to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s desk. \"I did my homework, Mrs. Jewls,\" she said. \"Really!\" \n \n \"Yes, I know,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She held Bebe\u0027s homework in her hand. \n \n \"Whew!\" Bebe sighed with relief. \"I was afraid you lost it!\" \n \n \"No, I didn\u0027t lose it,\" Mrs. Jewls said sternly. She showed the back of the paper to Bebe. Someone had written: \n \n MRS. JEWLS IS AS FAT AS A HIPPOPOTAMUS! \n \n (AND SHE SMELLS LIKE ONE, TOO.) \n \n \"I didn\u0027t write that!\" exclaimed Bebe. \"I love the way you smell.\" \n \n Mrs. Jewls smiled. \"But if you didn\u0027t write it, who did?\" \n \n \"Ray!\" Bebe instantly replied. \n \n \"Who\u0027s Ray?\" \n \n \"He\u0027s my little brother. Ray Gunn. He must have snuck into my room after I was asleep. He\u0027s always \n \n 14 \n \n playing mean tricks on me. He knew how hard I worked on my homework.\" \n \n \"Well, we\u0027ll show Ray,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She gave Bebe an A plus. \"There. I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll try that again.\" \n \n \"Thanks!\" said Bebe. \n \n \"You may have a Tootsie Roll Pop, too,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Bebe took a Tootsie Roll Pop out of the coffee can on Mrs. Jewls s desk, then returned to her seat. She proudly showed Calvin her A +. \n \n The next day Mrs. Jewls asked Dameon to hand back another batch of homework. \n \n \"How come Dameon always gets to do everything?\" griped Kathy. \n \n \"I\u0027m sorry, Kathy,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Would you like to pass back the homework?\" \n \n \"No!\" grumped Kathy. \"I\u0027m not your slave.\" \n \n Dameon passed out the homework. Again Bebe didn\u0027t get hers. \n \n Mrs. Jewls called her to her desk. On the back of her homework someone had written: \n \n MRS. JEWLS HAS A HEAD FULL OF OATMEAL! (AND IT LEAKS OUT HER EARS.) \n \n \"I didn\u0027t write it,\" said Bebe. \"Ray?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \n \n 15 \n \n Bebe nodded. \n \n \"Why don\u0027t you start checking the back of your homework?\" suggested Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"I did when I woke up!\" said Bebe. \"He must have done it after breakfast, while I was brushing my teeth. We had oatmeal for breakfast.\" She shook her head. \"I won\u0027t brush my teeth anymore!\" \n \n \"You have to brush your teeth,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"My parents think he\u0027s such a little angel!\" Bebe complained. \"He\u0027s always wrecking things, and then I\u0027m always the one who gets in trouble. \u0027Why can\u0027t you be more like Ray?\u0027 they say. Yesterday he threw all my underwear out the window. Then my mother yelled at me for it. She wouldn\u0027t believe that her little darling son would do something like that!\" \n \n Mrs. Jewls gave Bebe another A+ and another Tootsie Roll Pop. \n \n For Friday everyone had to write a report and read it to the class. Bebe wrote her report about George Washington. She stood at the front of the room and read it out loud. \n \n \"... George Washington never told a lie. Not like Mrs. Jewls. She lies all the time. That\u0027s why her nose is so big. And she snores when she sleeps, so Mister Jewls has to wear ear plugs.\" \n \n Everyone was laughing. \n \n Bebe stopped reading. \"What\u0027s so funny?\" she asked. \n \n 16 \n \n \"Come here,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Bebe shrugged, then walked to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s desk. \n \n Mrs. Jewls showed her what she had just read. \n \n \"Did I just read that out loud?\" Bebe asked. \n \n Mrs. Jewls nodded. \n \n \"I was just reading it,\" Bebe explained. \"I wasn\u0027t listening.\" \n \n \"It was Ray again, wasn\u0027t it?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Had to be,\" said Bebe. \"Yesterday he put toothpaste in my socks. Then my mother got mad at me for making a mess and wasting toothpaste.\" \n \n Bebe got an A 4- on her report and another Tootsie Roll Pop. \n \n After school Mrs. Jewls called Bebe\u0027s mother on the phone. \"Hello, Mrs. Gunn. This is Mrs. Jewls from Wayside School.\" \n \n \"What\u0027s Bebe done now?\" asked Mrs. Gunn. \n \n \"Bebe hasn\u0027t done anything wrong,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"She\u0027s a wonderful girl.\" \n \n \"Well, that\u0027s a surprise!\" said Mrs. Gunn. \"She\u0027s always causing trouble at home.\" \n \n \"I wanted to talk to you about that,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I think you\u0027re being unfair to Bebe. I think she often gets into trouble when really Ray is to blame.\" \n \n \"Ray?\" asked Mrs. Gunn. \n \n \"Yes. I know you think he\u0027s a perfect angel,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"but some children can be angels on the outside and devils underneath.\" \n \n 17 \n \n \"Yes, that sounds like Bebe,\" said Mrs. Gunn. \"I\u0027m not talking about Bebe. I\u0027m talking about Ray.\" \"Ray?\" asked Bebe\u0027s mother. \"Who\u0027s Ray?\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56860.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
