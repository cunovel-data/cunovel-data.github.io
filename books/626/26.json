They sat down on the grass to eat their lunches, but then Maurecia remembered she needed chocolate milk. She went to get some from Miss Mush. \\n\\n \\n\\n When she returned, she couldn\u0027t find her lunch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What happened to my lunch?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joy looked up at her, then shrugged her shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I set my lunch down right here!\" said Maurecia. \"You saw me, didn\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joy shook her head. \\n\\n \\n\\n 155 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I put it here, then I went to Miss Mush\u0027s room to get some chocolate milk. I had a peanut butter and banana sandwich! And there\u0027s no way I can eat a peanut butter and banana sandwich without chocolate milk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joy shrugged her shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia didn\u0027t know what to do. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ca\u0027 I haf a thip uff your milk?\" asked Joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was hard for Joy to talk, because her mouth was full of peanut butter and bananas. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia handed Joy the carton of chocolate milk. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joy took a big drink, then swallowed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia looked all around for her lunch. She crawled in the dirt as she searched through the bushes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Any luck?\" asked Joy as she finished Maurecia\u0027s chocolate milk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I found it!\" Maurecia exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joy coughed on the chocolate milk. \"You did?\" she asked, then coughed again. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia crawled out of the bushes holding a paper sack. She sat back down next to Joy and opened it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it your lunch?\" asked Joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Too bad,\" said Joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s money!\" exclaimed Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joy\u0027s eyes nearly popped out of her head as she looked at the paper bag. It was stuffed with dollar \\n\\n \\n\\n 156 \\n\\n \\n\\n bills. And they weren\u0027t just one-dollar bills. There were a few five-dollar bills, some ten-dollar bills, but mostly twenty-dollar bills. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We found a million dollars!\" Joy whispered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We?\" asked Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n They counted the money. It wasn\u0027t a million dollars. It was twenty thousand six hundred and fifty-five dollars. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s split it,\" said Joy. \"You take half and 111 take half.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maybe I should show it to Louis,\" said Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Louis!\" exclaimed Joy. \"Are you crazy? Let\u0027s spend it. We can buy a skateboard, or a bicycle, or a horse, or a fancy car, or an airplane!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I like taking the bus,\" said Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You could buy ice cream!\" said Joy. \"All the ice cream you ever want for the rest of your life.\" She knew Maurecia loved ice cream more than anything else in the world. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia smiled as she thought about it. \"No, I better show it to Louis. Hell know what to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll just get in trouble,\" warned Joy. \"Louis will think you robbed a bank. You\u0027ll go to jail for the rest of your life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Louis knows I\u0027m not a bank robber,\" said Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what if the real bank robbers find out you have their money?\" asked Joy. \"They\u0027ll come after you and murder you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 157 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I didn\u0027t think of that,\" said Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You better give it to me,\" said Joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Louis will protect me,\" said Maurecia. She walked across the playground. \\n\\n \\n\\n Louis was talking to Terrence. He said, \"If you ever tie Leslie\u0027s pigtails to the tetherball pole again, 111-\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Louis, look!\" said Maurecia. She held the paper sack up to his face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No thank you, Maurecia, I\u0027m not hungry,\" said Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s not my lunch,\" said Maurecia. \"Look inside!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Louis took the bag from her and looked inside. \"Very nice,\" he said, then gave it back to her. \"Now I want you to go untie Leslie and tell her-\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He suddenly stopped talking and blinked his eyes. He looked at Terrence, then at Maurecia, then at Terrence, then at Maurecia, and then at the paper sack. \"Let me see that again,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia gave him the bag. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, what about me?\" asked Terrence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Get lost, Jack Frost,\" said Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n Terrence ran away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you rob a bank?\" asked Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I found it in the bushes,\" said Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe you,\" said Louis. \"Well have to put it in the lost and found.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know,\" said Maurecia. \"Whoever lost it is probably very sad.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 158 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But if no one claims it in two weeks, you can have it,\" said Louis. He took the bag of money and headed to the office. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joy was waiting for Louis at the door. \"Hey, Louis,\" she said. \"I lost a bag full of money. Have you seen it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Help!\" Leslie screamed from the tetherball court. \\n\\n \\n\\n A week later, Maurecia was eating lunch alone. She was eating a piece of sweet potato pie. Joy was crawling around in the dirt looking for more bags of money. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maurecia,\" said Louis, \"I\u0027d like you to meet someone. This is Mr. Finch.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Finch was an old man with white hair and a long white beard. He shook Maurecia\u0027s hand with both of his hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s your money, isn\u0027t it?\" asked Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Finch nodded. \"It was my life\u0027s savings,\" he said. \"For fifty years I made pencils. I got a penny for every pencil I made. I hate pencils! But finally I saved enough money to quit my job and do what I always wanted to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" asked Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to open my own ice cream parlor,\" he said, then started to cry. \"When I lost that money, I thought I\u0027d have to start making pencils again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia cried too. \\n\\n \\n\\n 159 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, I want you to have this,\" blubbered Mr. Finch. He gave her an envelope containing five hundred dollars. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the second largest amount of money Maurecia had ever had. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I will give you free ice cream for the rest of your life at my ice cream parlor,\" he promised. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you!\" said Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, thank you,\" said Mr. Finch. \"I\u0027m so glad someone as kind and as honest as you found it. There are so many dishonest people in the world. It\u0027s good to know there are still good people too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They hugged each other. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joy crawled out of the bushes. \"Hey. Who\u0027s that?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is Mr. Finch,\" said Maurecia. \"It\u0027s his money. Look, he gave me a reward of five hundred dollars. And I\u0027ll get free ice cream for the rest of my life!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, what about me?\" Joy demanded. \"Don\u0027t I get anything?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear me,\" said Mr. Finch. \"I didn\u0027t realize there was someone else involved.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maurecia would never have found the money if it wasn\u0027t for me,\" said Joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, what\u0027d you do?\" asked Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I stole her lunch!\" Joy said proudly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Finch gave her a pencil. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56883.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
