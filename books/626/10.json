{"id":15478,"no":10,"title":"10. Music 音乐","content":"Benjamin still hadn\u0027t told anybody he wasn\u0027t Mark Miller. \n \n His grades had never been better. Mark Miller is a lot smarter than Benjamin Nushmutt, he thought. \n \n When they chose up teams for kickball, he was always the first one picked. Mark Miller is a better kicker than Benjamin Nushmutt, he realized. \n \n The girls in the class liked him too. Mark Miller is better looking than Benjamin Nushmutt, he decided. \n \n 55 \n \n But unfortunately, he knew he had to tell Mrs. Jewls his real name. He sighed, then slowly raised his hand. \n \n Mrs. Jewls gave him a tambourine. \n \n He had been so busy thinking about his problem, he hadn\u0027t noticed that Mrs. Jewls was passing out musical instruments. She had just asked, \"Who would like the tambourine?\" So when he raised his hand, she gave it to him. \n \n \"Who would like the triangle?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Joe raised his hand, and Mrs. Jewls gave it to him. \n \n \"Why is it called a triangle?\" asked Joe. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Maybe because it\u0027s shaped like a triangle,\" suggested John. \n \n \"No, that can\u0027t be it,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Then the tambourine would have to be called a circle.\" \n \n \"Maybe it was invented by a person named Joe Triangle,\" said Rondi. \n \n \"That\u0027s probably it,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She held up the next instrument. It was a glockenspiel. \"Who would like the glockenspiel?\" she asked. \n \n Sharie raised her hand. \n \n Nobody asked why it was called a glockenspiel. It was obvious. \n \n Mrs. Jewls gave the bells to Stephen. \n \n \"Why are they called bells?\" he asked. \n \n Nobody knew. \n \n 56 \n \n Joy got the bongo drums. Todd got the bass drum. Jenny snared the snare drum. And Leslie got the kettledrum. \n \n When they banged on them, it hurt everybody else\u0027s eardrums. \n \n Mrs. Jewls gave one cymbal to Calvin and the other cymbal to Bebe. \n \n D. J. got the gong. The three Erics got kazoos. \n \n Mrs. Jewls shouted, \"Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!\" \n \n The children all played their instruments. They shook, rattled, rocked, and rolled. \n \n Joy bonged her bongos. D. J. gonged his gong. Sharie glockened her glockenspiel. Stephen jingled his bells. Calvin and Bebe slapped their cymbals together. And Joe\u0027s triangle went ting. \n \n But something didn\u0027t sound right. \n \n \"What\u0027s wrong, Mark?\" Mrs. Jewls shouted over the music. \"Why aren\u0027t you playing the tambourine?\" \n \n \"My name\u0027s not Mark,\" said Benjamin. \"It\u0027s Benjamin Nushmutt. I\u0027m sorry for not telling you before.\" \n \n \"What?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"I can\u0027t hear you.\" \n \n \"My name isn\u0027t Mark!\" he said. \"It\u0027s Benjamin.\" \n \n \"Louder!\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n So everyone played louder. \n \n Todd bashed his bass drum. Leslie cooked on her kettledrum. Calvin and Bebe crashed their cymbals together. And Joe\u0027s triangle went ting. \n \n 57 \n \n \"My name is Benjamin!\" shouted Benjamin. \n \n Mrs. Jewls put her hand to her ear. \"Louder!\" she said. \n \n So everyone played louder. \n \n D.J. kabonged his gong. Joy chongoed her bongos. Paul splacked his castanets. Jenny spaghettied her snare drum. Calvin and Bebe wammered their cymbals. And Joe\u0027s triangle went ting. \n \n \"My name\u0027s Benjamin Nushmutt,\" hollered Benjamin Nushmutt. \n \n \"Louder!\" yelled Mrs. Jewls. \n \n So everyone played louder. \n \n The three Erics screamed into their kazoos. Calvin and Bebe ran to opposite sides of the room with their cymbals, then charged toward each other. \n \n Suddenly the door flew open, and a man entered. Benjamin had never seen him before. \n \n The whole class became very quiet. \n \n It was Mr. Kidswatter, the principal. \n \n Calvin and Bebe screeched to a halt just in time. Their cymbals were less than an inch apart. \n \n \"Is something the matter, Mr. Kidswatter?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Several teachers have complained about your music,\" said Mr. Kidswatter. \"Their students are having trouble hearing.\" \n \n \"I understand,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Good,\" said Mr. Kidswatter. He walked out of the room. \n \n \"Okay, you heard Mr. Kidswatter,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Well have to play louder so everyone can hear. Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!\" \n \n They shook, rattled, rocked, and rolled. \n \n Benjamin frampled his tambourine. \n \n \"Excellent, Mark!\" shouted Mrs. Jewls. \n \n He smiled. He had never played so well before. Mark Miller is a better musician than Benjamin Nush-mutt, he thought. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56867.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
