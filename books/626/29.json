{"id":15497,"no":29,"title":"30. Wayside School Is Falling Down 歪歪小学要倒了","content":"A strong wind whooshed around the playground in the early morning before school, blowing dirt and leaves in the faces of the children. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the bell rang, they could hardly make it from the playground to the school. The wind was blowing directly at them, pushing their hair straight back. \\n\\n \\n\\n With every gust of wind the school building teetered one way, then tottered back the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n As they headed up the stairs, they could feel the \\n\\n \\n\\n 174 \\n\\n \\n\\n building sway back and forth. The higher they got, the more it swayed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hooray!\" yelled Kathy. \"Wayside School is falling down!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you so happy about?\" asked Joe. \"Well all die.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, but we won\u0027t have to do our homework,\" said Kathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n They entered the room on the thirtieth story. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls rang her cowbell. \"Find your seats,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n That wasn\u0027t easy. All the desks were crammed together on one side of the room. The building swayed, and the desks slid to the other side of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n Finally the children all found their seats and planted their feet firmly on the floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We are going to have a fire drill today,\" Mrs. Jewls told them. \"So let\u0027s be prepared. Who is our door monitor this week?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am,\" said Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Who is our help monitor?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am,\" said Jason. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You have a big mouth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Stephen raised his hand. \"What if there really is a fire?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s not going to be a real fire,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"It\u0027s just a drill.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 175 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know, but what if there really is a fire?\" asked Stephen. \"And then the firemen won\u0027t come because they\u0027ll think it\u0027s a drill! The school will burn down!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" said Kathy. \"The school is not going to burn down. It\u0027s going to fall down!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n BLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP! . . . BLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP! . . . BLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP! \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the fire drill. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia, the door monitor, held open the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason, the help monitor, ran to the window. \"Help!\" he screamed. \"Save us! We\u0027re up here. Help! Help!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls led the children out of the room. If there was a real fire, the children might not be able to see her because of the smoke, so she constantly rang her cowbell. There wouldn\u0027t be time to go all the way down the stairs, either. Mrs. Jewls led them up the ladder and through the trapdoor to the roof. If there was a real fire, helicopters would rescue them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The wind was even worse on the roof than it was on the playground. Mrs. Jewls stood in the center and held the cowbell high above her head. She looked just like the Statue of Liberty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Everyone stay away from the edge!\" she warned. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy sang: \"Wayside School is falling down, falling down ...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s not falling down,\" said Stephen. \"It\u0027s burning down! And no one will rescue us because they think it\u0027s a drill.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jenny noticed a dark, funnel-shaped cloud off in \\n\\n \\n\\n 176 \\n\\n \\n\\n the distance. \"Tornado!\" she screamed. \"We\u0027re all going to get sucked off the roof!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A flash of lightning lit the sky, followed by a loud crack of thunder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to be struck by lightning!\" shouted Todd. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No we won\u0027t,\" said Stephen. \"We\u0027ll burn in the fire.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, well be sucked up in the tornado,\" said Jenny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, the school is going to fall down,\" said Kathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls continued to ring her cowbell. Kla-bonk! Klabonk! Klabonk! The strong wind carried the sound for miles. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly, screams came from down below. Then the whole building began to shake violently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Earthquake!\" yelled Benjamin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fire,\" corrected Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The school must have been struck by lightning,\" said Todd. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tornado,\" said Jenny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All fall down,\" said Kathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n The building continued to rumble and shake. There were more screams. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen!\" said Myron. \"They\u0027re trying to warn us about something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Down below, over five hundred kids and teachers were shouting together: \"STAR BRINGING PURPLE!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are they saying?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Myron. \\n\\n \\n\\n 177 \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls rattled her cowbell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"STAR BRINGING PURPLE!\" they shouted again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It sounds like \u0027Star bringing purple,\u0027\" said Myron. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What does that mean?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Myron shrugged. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls rang her bell even louder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"STAR BRINGING YORBEL!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait,\" said Myron. \"They\u0027re not saying, \u0027Star bringing purple.\u0027 They\u0027re saying, \u0027Star bringing yorbel.\u0027 \" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s a yorbel?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. She rang her bell even louder. \\n\\n \\n\\n The school shook and rumbled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"STOP BRINGING YORBEL!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop something,\" said Myron. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls rang her cowbell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"STOP RINGING YOUR BELL!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop ringing your bell,\" said Myron. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She stopped ringing her bell. \\n\\n \\n\\n Down below, all the students and teachers clapped their hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n But it was too late. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi opened the trapdoor. \"Cows!\" she exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n The school was filled with cows. \\n\\n \\n\\n From all over the countryside, cows had heard Mrs. Jewls\u0027s cowbell and heeded the call. There were \\n\\n \\n\\n 178 \\n\\n \\n\\n thousands of them. They filled the stairs and all the classrooms. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was no way for the children to get down. Helicopters finally came and took them one at a time off the roof. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wayside School didn\u0027t blow down. It didn\u0027t burn down. It wasn\u0027t struck by lightning, sucked up in a tornado, or destroyed by an earthquake. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was cowed. \\n\\n \\n\\n No one knew how to get rid of the cows. Cows are strange animals. They don\u0027t mind walking up stairs, but nothing can make them walk down stairs. \\n\\n \\n\\n Someone suggested starving the cows, but the farmers wouldn\u0027t allow that. Thousands of bales of hay were sent in. Several cows had calves. \\n\\n \\n\\n The newspapers thought it was funny and made jokes about smart cows learning to read and write. \\n\\n \\n\\n And so Wayside School was closed. The kids and teachers were temporarily sent to different schools. \\n\\n \\n\\n Only one person stayed behind. He was there all day and all night trying to get the cows to go home. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"C\u0027mon,\" pleaded Louis, the yard teacher, as he pushed and pulled on the cows. \"Go home. Please? Pretty please?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody mooed. \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56886.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
