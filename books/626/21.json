Fourteen two-minute breaks had passed. \"It\u0027s dictionary time,\" said Miss Zarves. Everybody got out a dictionary. Allison found a dictionary in her desk, too. \"What are we supposed to do with it?\" she asked. \"Memorize it,\" said Nick. \"But that\u0027s impossible!\" said Allison. \"No, it\u0027s easy,\" Virginia assured her. \"You memorize 117 one word at a time, until you get a whole page. Then you go on to the next page.\" \"How many words have you memorized?\" asked Allison. \"I\u0027m almost finished with the B\u0027s,\" Virginia said proudly. \"And I\u0027ve only been doing it for thirty-two years!\" Allison opened her dictionary. Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class! she suddenly remembered. She sighed with relief. For the last six days she\u0027d been trying to remember where she came from. In her mind she went through everybody in her former class. She didn\u0027t want to forget again. As she thought about each person, tears filled her eyes. She missed them very much. Even Jason. They were all so wonderful in their own special ways. When the two-minute break came, she talked to Mark again. He was the only person in the class who still seemed to have a brain. \"How did we get here?\" she asked. \"Maybe we\u0027re dead,\" said Mark. \"Maybe we died and went to-\" \"This isn\u0027t Heaven!\" said Allison. \"That wasn\u0027t what I was going to say,\" said Mark. Allison felt a chill run up her spine. She looked at Miss Zarves. Miss Zarves smiled back at her. \"But she seems so nice,\" said Allison. \"Could someone as nice as her really be the devil?\" 118 \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Mark. \"She always gives good grades.\" \"What would happen if we didn\u0027t do our work?\" asked Allison. \"We have to do our work,\" said Mark. \"Why?\" asked Allison. \"What\u0027s Miss Zarves going to do to us-keep us after school?\" \u0027\"I don\u0027t know,\" said Mark. \"Teachers can always find new ways to punish you. They\u0027re experts at it.\" \"Your two minutes are up, boys and girls,\" announced Miss Zarves. \"Everyone back to work.\" Allison returned to her seat. She tried to figure it all out, but she had so much busy work to do, she didn\u0027t have time to think. That\u0027s her plan! Allison suddenly realized. She shivered as it all came together for her. Miss Zarves assigns us lots of busy work so we don\u0027t have time to think. She makes us memorize stupid things so that we don\u0027t think about the important things. And then she gives us good grades to keep us happy. Miss Zarves walked around the room. \"Very good, Virginia,\" she said. \"You are doing so well. Excellent, Ray! Good job, Nick.\" She stopped when she got to Allison. \"Allison, why aren\u0027t you working?\" Allison looked at her. She knew Mark was right. Teachers are experts at finding ways to punish you. 119 And if Miss Zarves was the devil, who knew what she might have up her sleeve? Still, Allison had to take a chance. If she wanted to get back to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class, she had to act as if she were in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class. She took off her shoes and socks, sat on the floor, and sucked her toes. \"Allison, what are you doing?\" asked Miss Zarves. Allison took her toe out of her mouth. \"Get off my case, Buzzard Face,\" she said. Miss Zarves was furious. \"Return to your desk, young lady!\" she ordered. Allison returned to her desk. But instead of sitting at it, she climbed on top of it and sang a song. \"I got one sock! Lookin\u0027 for the other. One sock! Lookin\u0027 for its brother. When I find that sock! I\u0027ll tell you what 111 do. I\u0027ll put it on my foot, and I\u0027ll stick it in my shoe!\" Mark Miller smiled at her and silently clapped his hands. Everyone else looked at her like she was crazy. \"Your socks are on the floor, next to your shoes,\" 120 Miss Zarves said coldly. \"Ill give you ten seconds to put them on your feet. Ten . . . nine . . . eight. . . seven ...\" Allison climbed down from her desk. She picked up her socks and put them on her ears. \"How\u0027s this?\" she asked. \"Six . . . five . . . four . . .\" \"Albert Einstein didn\u0027t wear socks,\" said Allison. \"Why should I?\" \"Three . . . two ...\" Allison closed her eyes. \"One!\" She felt something slam down on her foot. Something else jammed into her stomach. \"Umph!\" she grunted as she fell and rolled down three steps. \"Are you all right?\" asked Deedee. \"Huh?\" said Allison. She was on the stairs, somewhere between the eighteenth and twentieth stories. \"Sorry,\" said Ron. \"I didn\u0027t see you. Deedee and I were racing up the stairs, and then you suddenly appeared.\" \"You knocked off her shoes and socks!\" exclaimed Deedee. \"Oh, I ripped your windbreaker, too,\" said Ron. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"That\u0027s okay,\" said Allison. She picked up her shoes and socks. \"Race you up the stairs!\" 121 All three ran up to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room. When they got there, they were so pooped, they sat with their heads flat on their desks and their tongues hanging out. \"Hi, Allison,\" said Rondi. Allison raised her head. \"Hi, Rondi,\" she said happily. \"What did I miss while I was absent?\" \"When were you absent?\" asked Rondi. \"Hey, how come you\u0027re not wearing your shoes and socks?\" Allison hung her socks from her ears. \"What do you think?\" she asked. \"It\u0027s the new look!\" Rondi laughed. \"Allison,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"you seem to have a bad case of the sillies this morning.\" Allison giggled. Jason entered the room carrying a glass bowl with a goldfish swimming inside it. \"Look what I brought!\" he said. \"What\u0027s the name of your goldfish?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"Shark!\" said Jason. Everyone laughed. \"It makes him feel important,\" Jason explained. \"Where should I put him?\" \"How about on top of the coat closet?\" suggested Mrs. Jewls. 122 Jason had to stand on a chair on his tiptoes. He held the bowl at the very bottom as he tried to nudge it over the edge of the closet. Allison turned around to watch. She didn\u0027t want to miss this! 123 20, 21, \u0026 22. Eric, Eric, \u0026 Eric Mr. Kidswatter\u0027s voice crackled over the loudspeaker. \"MRS. JEWLS, SEND ERIC TO MY OFFICE, AT ONCE!\" He sounded mad. Mrs. Jewls was confused. \"When did we get a loudspeaker?\" she asked. \"Louis put it in yesterday,\" said Jenny. Mrs. Jewls was still confused. There were three Erics in her class. She didn\u0027t know which one Mr. Kidswatter meant. 124 Eric Fry was fat, but not short. Eric Bacon was short, but not fat. Eric Ovens was short and fat. Mrs. Jewls chose the biggest Eric. \"Eric Fry, Mr. Kidswatter wants to see you.\" Eric Fry trembled as he slowly stood up. The other two Erics smiled. The principal\u0027s office was on the first floor. It\u0027s not fair, Eric thought as he headed down to his doom. Anytime any Eric does something wrong, I\u0027m the one who gets in trouble. He stood in front of the principal\u0027s door. His heart beat very fast. He took a couple of breaths, then knocked lightly. \"Enter!\" boomed Mr. Kidswatter. Eric turned the doorknob. He took one step inside, then stood with his back against the wall, as far away from Mr. Kidswatter as he could get. Mr. Kidswatter sat behind an enormous desk. He wore mirrored sunglasses so Eric couldn\u0027t tell where he was looking. \"Sit down, Eric,\" he said. Eric moved to the small metal chair in front of the desk. A bare light bulb hung above his head. Mr. Kidswatter cracked his knuckles. \"We can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way,\" he said. \"It\u0027s your choice.\" \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" said Eric. \"I didn\u0027t do anything.\" 125 \"So it\u0027s the hard way, is it?\" asked Mr. Kidswatter. \"Very well. You 11 talk. One way or another, you\u0027ll tell me everything I want to know.\" \"But-\" Mr. Kidswatter pounded his fist on his desk. \"When was the last time you sharpened your pencil?\" Eric tried to remember, but he was too nervous to think. \"Um, wait, let me think,\" he stammered. \"We had a spelling test on Friday, but I borrowed-\" \"Where were you yesterday afternoon, at a quarter past twelve?\" asked Mr. Kidswatter. \"Yesterday?\" asked Eric. \"I was here, at Wayside School. I remember I ate lunch and then I played kickball.\" Mr. Kidswatter smiled. \"Do you kick with your left foot?\" he asked. \"No, I\u0027m right-footed,\" said Eric Fry. \"Humph!\" grumbled Mr. Kidswatter. \"Have you ever gotten your hair cut at Charley\u0027s Barber Shop?\" \"Yes,\" said Eric. \"Two weeks ago.\" \"Aha!\" said Mr. Kidswatter. \"So you admit it! Do you know what a Mugworm Griblick is?\" Eric Fry turned pale. \"No, please!\" he begged. \"I didn\u0027t do it! I\u0027m innocent! You\u0027ve got the wrong Eric. There are two other Erics in my class.\" Mr. Kidswatter scowled. \"So that\u0027s the way you\u0027re going to play it, is it? Well, that\u0027s fine with me. I\u0027ve got all the time in the world.\" 126 He flicked on the microphone. \"MRS. JEWLS! SEND ME ANOTHER ERIC!\" Twenty-nine floors above them, Mrs. Jewls looked at the two remaining Erics. \"Okay, Eric Ovens,\" she said. Eric Ovens shivered. His eyes filled with tears. Why me? he asked himself over and over again as he walked down the stairs. It\u0027s my parents\u0027 fault! Why did they have to name me Eric? Why couldn\u0027t they name me Osgood? He tapped on the door to the principal\u0027s office. \"Come in!\" bellowed Mr. Kidswatter. Eric Ovens gulped, then walked inside. He sat in the little chair in front of Mr. Kidswatter\u0027s enormous desk. Eric Fry was nowhere to be seen. \"Wh-what ha-happened to Eric Fry?\" he asked \"I\u0027ll ask the questions!\" barked Mr. Kidswatter. \"But don\u0027t worry, Eric,\" he said gently. \"You have nothing to fear. So long as you tell the truth.\" He cracked his knuckles. Eric Ovens was very scared. Mrs. Jewls always said that there was more than one answer to every question. He hoped he gave Mr. Kidswatter the right ones. \"Did you have a spelling test last Friday?\" Mr. Kidswatter asked. \"Yes,\" said Eric Ovens. \"How did you know that?\" \"I have my ways,\" Mr. Kidswatter said slyly, 127 behind his mirrored glasses. \"When was the last time you sharpened your pencil?\" \"This morning,\" said Eric Ovens. \"Maurecia accidentally stepped on it and-\" \"Did you play kickball yesterday at a quarter after twelve?\" \"No, I played tetherball.\" \"Right- or left-handed?\" \"Right.\" Mr. Kidswatter tossed a stapler at him. Eric caught it with his right hand. Mr. Kidswatter scowled. \"Okay, Eric, tell me this. Have you ever gotten your hair cut at Charley\u0027s Barber Shop?\" \"No, but I will. I\u0027ll go right now if you want.\" \"You\u0027re not going anywhere!\" shouted Mr. Kidswatter. \"Have you ever heard of a Mugworm Griblick?\" Eric Ovens screamed. Upstairs, Mrs. Jewls heard Mr. Kidswatter\u0027s voice resound over the loudspeaker. \"MRS. JEWLS, SEND ME THE LAST ERIC!\" \"On my way!\" said Eric Bacon. He hopped out of his chair and bounced down the stairs. He didn\u0027t bother knocking on Mr. Kidswatter\u0027s door. He just walked right in. \"What can I do for you?\" he asked. There was no sign of Eric Ovens. 128 \"Have a seat,\" said Mr. Kidswatter. \"I just want to ask you a few questions.\" \"Sure thing,\" said Eric Bacon. He sat in the little chair. He leaned back with his hands behind his head and his feet up on Mr. Kidswatter\u0027s desk. He looked at himself in Mr. Kidswatter\u0027s mirrored glasses, took a comb out of his back pocket, and combed his hair. His hair was very neat and trim. He had gotten it cut yesterday, at 12:15, at Charley\u0027s Barber Shop. Mr. Kidswatter cracked his knuckles. \"When\u0027s the last time you sharpened your pencil?\" he asked. \"November eleventh,\" Eric Bacon answered right away. \"It was three minutes before five o\u0027clock in the afternoon. I remember because my watch stopped.\" \"Where were you yesterday at twelve fifteen?\" \"I was in the garden, having tea.\" \"Did Maurecia step on somebody\u0027s pencil this morning?\" asked Mr. Kidswatter. \"Yes.\" \"Whose?\" \"She stepped on everybody\u0027s pencil,\" said Eric Bacon. \"Are you left-handed or right-footed?\" demanded Mr. Kidswatter. \"I write with my left foot, and I kick with my right hand,\" replied Eric Bacon. Mr. Kidswatter scowled. \"Have you ever gotten your hair cut at Charley\u0027s Barber Shop?\" 129 \"No, I never get my hair cut,\" said Eric Bacon. \"I\u0027m bald. This is a wig.\" Mr. Kidswatter took off his glasses and glared at him. \"Do the words \u0027Mugworm Griblick\u0027 mean anything to you?\" Eric Bacon shook his head. \"I can look it up in the dictionary if you want.\" Mr. Kidswatter shook his head. \"I tried that,\" he said. \"It\u0027s not there.\" He rubbed his chin. \"Okay, boys, you can come out now.\" Eric Ovens and Eric Fry crawled out from under the desk. Mr. Kidswatter looked at each Eric. \"One of you is lying,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know who it is, but I\u0027ll find out. And when I do, whoever it is will be very sorry. Now I\u0027ll give you one last chance to come clean.\" Eric Fry trembled. Eric Ovens shivered. \"C\u0027mon, let\u0027s blow this Popsicle stand,\" said Eric Bacon. He walked out of the room. The other two Erics followed. Mr. Kidswatter rubbed the back of his neck. He looked at the white card on top of his desk. On one side it said: CHARLEY\u0027S BARBER SHOP Under that, in blue ink, it said: 130 Eric, Tuesday, 12:15 He turned the card over. On the other side, a left-handed person had written with a sharp pencil: Mr. Kidswatter is a Mugworm Griblick.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56878.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
