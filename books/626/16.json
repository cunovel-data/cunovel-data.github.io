{"id":15484,"no":16,"title":"16. Love and a Dead Rat 爱和死老鼠","content":"Dameon was in love with one of the girls in his class. Can you guess which one? \n \n He thought about her all the time. \n \n Myron threw a red ball to Dameon. It bounced off his face. \n \n \"Huh?\" said Dameon. \n \n \"Why didn\u0027t you catch the ball?\" asked Myron. \n \n \"What ball?\" asked Dameon. \n \n \"The one that hit you in the face,\" said Myron. \n \n 90 \n \n \"Did a ball hit me in the face?\" asked Dameon. \n \n \"Yes,\" said Myron. \n \n \"Oh, good,\" said Dameon. \"I was wondering why my nose hurt.\" \n \n He had been thinking about the girl he loved. \n \n He was in love with Mrs. Jewls. \n \n That was why he was always doing things for her, like passing out papers. He thought she was very pretty and nice. He thought she was smart, too. In fact, he thought she was one of the smartest people in the class. \n \n After recess he hurried back up the stairs. \n \n \"Hello, Dameon,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Hello, Mrs. Jewls,\" he said. \n \n \"You\u0027re always the first one here, aren\u0027t you?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Dameon blushed and shrugged his shoulders. \"Do you need any papers passed out or anything?\" he asked. \n \n \"It\u0027s so nice of you to ask,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"I think you\u0027re nice too,\" said Dameon. \n \n Mrs. Jewls gave him a stack of workbooks to hand out. Then she gave him a Tootsie Roll Pop from the coffee can on her desk for being so helpful. \"But don\u0027t eat it until after lunch,\" she said. \n \n \"I won\u0027t,\" he assured her. \n \n He ate lunch with Myron and D.J. He saved his Tootsie Roll Pop for last. \n \n 91 \n \n Joy and Maurecia came up behind him. \n \n \"Hi, Dameon,\" said Joy. \"How\u0027s your girlfriend?\" \n \n \"What?\" asked Dameon. He turned red. \"Who are you talking about? I don\u0027t have a girlfriend!\" \n \n \"You\u0027re in love with Mrs. Jewls!\" accused Maurecia. \n \n \"You better watch out,\" said Joy. \"Mister Jewls might come after you.\" \n \n The two girls laughed. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" said Dameon. \"I\u0027m not in love with Mrs. Jewls!\" He looked to his friends for support. \n \n Myron shrugged. \n \n D.J. smiled. \n \n \"Prove it!\" said Joy. \"Prove you\u0027re not in love with her.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s stupid,\" said Dameon. \"How can I prove I\u0027m not in love with Mrs. Jewls?\" \n \n \"Give her this,\" said Joy. She handed Dameon a paper bag. \n \n \"Your lunch?\" asked Dameon. \n \n \"Look inside,\" said Maurecia. \n \n Inside the paper bag was a dead rat. \n \n Dameon knew Mrs. Jewls hated dead rats more than anything in the world. \n \n \"Put it in her desk,\" said Joy. \n \n \"If you don\u0027t, it means you love her,\" said Maurecia. \n \n \"I\u0027m not in love with her,\" said Dameon. \n \n 92 \n \n \"Prove it,\" said Joy. \n \n \"Okay, I will!\" said Dameon. \n \n The girls left. \n \n \"You don\u0027t have to put the dead rat in her desk,\" said D. J. \n \n \"We don\u0027t care,\" said Myron. \n \n \"You think I\u0027m in love with her too, don\u0027t you?\" asked Dameon. \n \n Myron shrugged. \n \n D.J. smiled. \n \n \"Some friends you are!\" said Dameon. \"Ill show you!\" \n \n After lunch he was the first one back in class. He carried Joy\u0027s paper sack. \n \n \"Hello, Dameon,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Did you have a nice lunch?\" \n \n \"It was all right,\" he muttered. \n \n \"Oh, would you mind getting the construction paper from the closet and putting it on my desk?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"Thank you.\" \n \n Dameon went to the closet and got the construction paper. He put it on her desk. Then, when she wasn\u0027t looking he opened her desk drawer and dumped the dead rat into it. He shut the drawer. \n \n \"Thank you, Dameon,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You\u0027re always so helpful. It\u0027s such a pleasure to have you in my class.\" \n \n Dameon felt awful. \n \n 93 \n \n Mrs. Jewls read a story to the class. \n \n Dameon couldn\u0027t pay attention. He kept wondering when she\u0027d open her drawer. \n \n After the story they had art. Everyone was supposed to make snowflakes. \n \n Dameon folded his piece of construction paper in half. \n \n Mrs. Jewls screamed. \n \n \"What\u0027s wrong, Mrs. Jewls?\" asked Joy. \n \n \"Somebody put a dead rat in my desk,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"I did!\" declared Dameon. \n \n \"Dameon?\" Mrs. Jewls said with great surprise. \"Why?\" \n \n \"Because I hate you!\" said Dameon. \"You\u0027re always making me do things for you.\" \n \n \"Oh, I see,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Should I write my name on the board under DISCIPLINE?\" he asked. \n \n \"No, that won\u0027t be necessary,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n That made him feel even worse. Why did I have to prove myself to Joy? he wondered. I don\u0027t like Joy. I like Mrs. Jewls. He felt rotten. \n \n When the bell rang, Dameon waited for all the other kids to leave. Then he walked to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s desk. \n \n She was grading papers. \"Yes, Dameon?\" \n \n \"Do you want me to erase the board for you?\" he asked. \n \n 94 \n \n \"That\u0027s all right,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Ill do it myself.\" \n \n Dameon sadly walked out of the room and down the stairs. When he reached the bottom, he turned and ran all the way back up to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room. \n \n She was just putting on her coat. \n \n \"I love you, Mrs. Jewls!\" Dameon declared. \"I\u0027m sorry I put the dead rat in your desk. I did it because I didn\u0027t want everyone to know I loved you. I\u0027m sorry.\" \n \n \"I love you, too, Dameon,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"You do? But what about Mister Jewls?\" \n \n \"Just because I love Mister Jewls, it doesn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t also love you. Love is different from most things.\" She picked up a piece of chalk. \"If I gave my piece of chalk to someone, then I wouldn\u0027t have it anymore. But when I give my love to someone, I end up with more love than I started with. The more love you give away, the more you have left.\" \n \n Dameon smiled. \"I love you, Mrs. Jewls,\" he said. He felt his heart fill up with more love. \n \n \"I love you, Dameon,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"This is getting disgusting!\" said the dead rat. It climbed out of Mrs. Jewls\u0027s desk and walked out of the room. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56873.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
