They waited for Mrs. Jewls to tell them the wonderful news. \n \n \"You are a very lucky class indeed,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Mrs. Waloosh, the world famous dancer, will be coming here to Wayside School! She will teach you how to dance!\" \n \n 161 \n \n Everyone was still waiting for the wonderful news. \n \n \"Isn\u0027t that exciting?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"You will see her every Wednesday instead of going to P.E.\" \n \n \"Will girls have to dance with boys?\" asked Jenny. \n \n \"I suppose,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Gross!\" exclaimed Leslie. \n \n \"Yuck!\" said Dana. \n \n \"Will boys have to dance with girls?\" asked Ron. \n \n \"Obviously,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"No way!\" said Eric Fry. \n \n \"I\u0027d rather dance with a dead rat!\" said Terrence. \n \n Everybody started talking at once-about cooties, and warts, and other horrible diseases you get from touching girls or boys. \n \n Mrs. Jewls rang her cowbell again and told them to settle down. \n \n \"Mrs. Jewls, I don\u0027t need to take dancing lessons,\" said Eric Bacon. \"I already know how to dance!\" \n \n \"Yes, Eric, I\u0027ve seen you \u0027dance,\u0027 \" Mrs. Jewls said sarcastically. \n \n Eric Bacon was a great breakdancer. But break-dancing was no longer allowed at Wayside School. That was because every time Eric danced, he broke something. \n \n \"Mrs. Waloosh will teach you the grace and beauty of classical ballroom dancing,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Everybody groaned. \n \n On Wednesday they all headed down to their first \n \n 162 \n \n dancing lesson. Except Myron. Myron went to P.E. \n \n \"How come Myron never has to do anything?\" asked Jason. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know!\" said Calvin. \"I\u0027ve been wondering about that too.\" \n \n \"Myron\u0027s father must be friends with the president,\" said Bebe. \n \n \"I think Myron gave Mr. Kidswatter a thousand dollars,\" said Todd. \n \n \"No, I bet he\u0027s blackmailing Mrs. Jewls,\" said Jenny. \n \n \"How could he do that?\" asked Benjamin. \n \n \"Maybe Mrs. Jewls got drunk!\" said Jenny. \"And then she danced on top of her desk with a lampshade on her head. And Myron took her picture. And so now Mrs. Jewls has to let Myron do anything he wants, or else he\u0027ll show the picture to Mr. Kid-swatter!\" \n \n \"That makes sense,\" said Mac. \n \n \"Except if she had a lampshade on her head, how would Mr. Kidswatter know it was Mrs. Jewls?\" asked Todd. \n \n No one knew the answer to that. \n \n They entered the room on the second floor. \n \n \"Welcome!\" said Mrs. Waloosh, a strange-looking woman with bright red hair. It looked like her head was on fire. \"My name eez Meez Valooosh. It\u0027s so wonderful to be here at Vayside School.\" \n \n 163 \n \n She wore pink tights and a sparkling pink top. \"I hope ve vill be friends, yes?\" she asked. \n \n Nobody said a word. \n \n All around were red and green balls. There was also one yellow ball. This was the room where Louis kept the balls for lunch and recess. It was also the room that was always used for school dances. It was the ballroom. \n \n \"So!\" exclaimed Mrs. Waloosh. \"Who vill be first?\" \n \n Everyone tried to hide behind someone else. \n \n Mrs. Waloosh put her hands on Ron\u0027s face. \"Vhat eez your name?\" she asked. \n \n \"Ron,\" he squeaked. \n \n \"RONALDO!\" bellowed Mrs. Waloosh. \"King of the Gypsies!\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know how to dance,\" said Ron. \n \n \"Dahnce?\" asked Mrs. Waloosh. She looked very surprised. \"Ve are not going to dahnce,\" she said. \n \n \"We\u0027re not?\" asked Ron. \n \n \"No, Ronaldo,\" whispered Mrs. Waloosh. \"Ve are going to tango!\" \n \n She put her left arm around Ron\u0027s waist. Then she grabbed his left hand with her right and stuck it way out in front of them. Suddenly the music started. \n \n Mrs. Waloosh dragged poor Ron across the room as she stomped her feet in time to the music. \n \n Domp. Domp-domp. Domp-domp. Da-da-domp. \n \n 164 \n \n Domp! Domp! Domp! Domp! Domp-domp-domp-domp-domp, \"HEY!\" \n \n When she yelled \"HEY!\" she threw Ron up in the air and clapped her hands. Ron turned a somersault in midair; then Mrs. Waloosh caught him. They tangoed back to where they started. Ron\u0027s eyes were spinning in opposite directions. \n \n \"Hey, that looked like fun,\" said Maurecia. \"Do me.\" \n \n \"Very veil,\" said Mrs. Waloosh. She grabbed Maurecia and tangoed with her across the room. Domp. Domp-domp. Domp-domp. Da-da-domp. Domp! Domp! Domp! Domp! Domp-domp-domp-domp-domp, \"HEY!\" She threw Maurecia up in the air and clapped her hands. \n \n Maurecia turned a double somersault before Mrs. Waloosh caught her. They tangoed back to the front. \n \n \"My turn,\" said Terrence. \n \n As Mrs. Waloosh tangoed with Terrence, the other kids stamped their feet along with Mrs. Waloosh. They all yelled \"HEY!\" at the same time and clapped their hands. \n \n One by one, Mrs. Waloosh tangoed with every kid in the class. The other kids danced with each other. Boys danced with girls, and girls danced with boys. They didn\u0027t care. Paul danced with Leslie. Dana danced with John. Terrence danced with Rondi. Allison danced with Jason. D.J. danced with Kathy. Todd danced with Joy. \n \n 165 \n \n \"HEY!\" they all shouted together. \n \n Of course, they weren\u0027t strong enough to throw each other up in the air. Instead, they tried to trip each other and throw each other to the ground. \"HEY!\" \n \n Even Kathy was having fun. \"HEY!\" she shouted as she kicked D. J. in the rear end. \n \n They also threw the balls at each other. \"HEY!\" \n \n Mrs. Waloosh began to get tired. Sometimes she didn\u0027t catch the children after she tossed them in the air. \n \n Deedee crashed to the floor. \"Wow,\" she said, \"this is more fun than murder-the-man-with-the-ball! HEY!\" \n \n At last the music stopped. Domp! Domp! Domp! Domp! Domp-domp-domp-domp-domp. And everyone shouted \"HEY!\" one last time. \n \n Mrs. Waloosh clapped her hands. \"Vonderful!\" she exclaimed. \"Fahntasteek!\" \n \n They all staggered out of the ballroom, cut up, bruised, and bleeding. \n \n \"Next veek, ve valtz!\" Mrs. Waloosh called after them. \n \n \"So how did everyone like dancing?\" asked Mrs. Jewls when they returned. \n \n \"Dahnce?\" asked Ronaldo, King of the Gypsies. \"Ve didn\u0027t dahnce.\" \n \n \"You didn\u0027t?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \n \n 166 \n \n 167 \n \n \"No,\" said Ronaldo. \"Ve tangoed!\" \n \n Everyone cheered. \n \n \"It vas vonderful!\" exclaimed Kathy. \n \n \"Fahntasteek!\" said Terrence. \n \n Myron was sorry he had missed it. \n \n \"I can\u0027t vait till next Vednesday,\" said Todd. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56884.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
