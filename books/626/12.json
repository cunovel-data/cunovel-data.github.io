{"id":15480,"no":12,"title":"12. Pencils 铅笔","content":"Jason borrowed a pencil from Allison. When he gave it back to her, it was full of teeth marks. \\n\\n \\n\\n Allison held the pencil by its point. \"Yuck!\" she said. \"You chewed on it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason felt awful. It is very embarrassing to borrow somebody\u0027s pencil and then chew on it. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t do it on purpose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can keep it,\" said Allison. She dropped the pencil on Jason\u0027s desk, then raised her hand. \"Mrs. \\n\\n \\n\\n 66 \\n\\n \\n\\n Jewls, can I go to the bathroom? I have to wash my hands. Jason slobbered all over my pencil.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason turned red. \"I\u0027m sorry, Allison,\" he said. \"I know it\u0027s a disgusting habit. I just can\u0027t help it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let Jason touch any of my books,\" said Allison as she headed out of the room. \"He might eat them!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody laughed again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, you can eat my book, Jason,\" said Todd. \"I don\u0027t like it anyway.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls made Todd write his name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason was so mad at himself, he broke the chewed-up pencil to bits. \\n\\n \\n\\n That wasn\u0027t a smart thing to do. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Everybody take out a pencil and a piece of paper,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"It\u0027s time for our spelling test.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason slapped himself on the forehead. I\u0027m so stupid! he thought. \"Rondi, may I borrow a pencil, please?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi made a face. \"All my pencils are new,\" she said. \"How do I know you won\u0027t eat it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I won\u0027t,\" said Jason. \"I promise.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You better not,\" said Rondi. She gave him one of her pencils. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was new and freshly sharpened. Jason liked the way it smelled. \\n\\n \\n\\n 67 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The first word is \u0027orchestra,\u0027 \" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason tried to remember how to spell orchestra. He stuck the back of the pencil in his mouth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Second word, \u0027garbanzo.\u0027 \" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason chewed on the eraser. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the spelling test was over, Rondi\u0027s pencil was worse than Allison\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason looked at it in horror. He didn\u0027t even remember chewing it. Oh, no! he thought. What am I going to do? He stuck it inside his desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jason, may I have my pencil back, please?\" asked Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What pencil?\" asked Jason. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The one I lent you,\" said Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason opened his desk and pretended to look for it. \"I don\u0027t know where it is,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mrs. Jewls, Jason stole my pencil!\" called Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jason, give Rondi back her pencil,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n He gave it to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You chewed on it!\" exclaimed Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No I didn\u0027t,\" said Jason, \"Those are your teeth marks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can they be my teeth marks?\" asked Rondi. She smiled. She was missing her two front teeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So?\" said Jason. \"You don\u0027t chew pencils with your front teeth. You chew them with your back teeth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you know?\" asked Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Um, um, uh,\" said Jason. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls made Jason write his name on the board under the word DISCIPLINE because he chewed Rondi\u0027s pencil, then lied about it. \"And try not to eat the chalk,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi threw the chewed-up pencil out the window. \\n\\n \\n\\n It hit Louis on the head. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls gave Dameon a stack of work sheets and asked him to pass them out. They contained arithmetic problems. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason had to borrow another pencil. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Allison, may I borrow another pencil, please?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eat my socks,\" said Allison. \\n\\n \\n\\n That wasn\u0027t such a bad idea, Jason realized. If he stuffed a sock in his mouth, he wouldn\u0027t be able to chew a pencil. \\n\\n \\n\\n Myron looked at his work sheet. \"I don\u0027t feel like doing this stuff,\" he said. \"Here, Jason, you can have my pencil.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thanks, Myron,\" said Jason. \"I promise not to chew it.\" He hoped he\u0027d be able to keep his promise. \\n\\n \\n\\n He thought about asking Mrs. Jewls for a Tootsie Roll Pop. If I\u0027m sucking on that, I won\u0027t chew Myron\u0027s pencil. And a Tootsie Roll Pop would probably taste better than Allison\u0027s socks. He didn\u0027t know for sure because he had never tasted Allison\u0027s socks. \\n\\n \\n\\n 69 \\n\\n \\n\\n But before he could ask Mrs. Jewls, Mrs. Jewls called him. \"Jason, will you come here for a moment,\" she said. \"I think I know how to keep you from chewing pencils.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason smiled as he walked to her desk. \"I like the purple ones,\" he told her. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Mrs. Jewls didn\u0027t give him a Tootsie Roll Pop. Instead, she taped his mouth shut with heavy-duty masking tape. She had to use a lot of tape, because Jason had the second biggest mouth in the class. \"There,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason started back to his seat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you even going to say thank you?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mhhmm hhm,\" said Jason. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re welcome,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, Jason,\" teased Allison. \"You look like a mummy!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t sneeze,\" said Rondi. \"You\u0027ll blow your head off!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They both laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mh mhhh mhrhhmmm!\" Jason said back to them. It was a very bad thing to say. He wasn\u0027t supposed to use words like that. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You better not pull the tape off,\" said Rondi. \"You might rip off your lips!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They both laughed again. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jason had never been more embarrassed in his \\n\\n \\n\\n 70 \\n\\n \\n\\n whole life. His ears burned as he set to work on the arithmetic problems. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were tough problems. Several times the pencil crashed against the tape, but the tape held firm. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls was very proud of herself. Not only did the tape protect Myron\u0027s pencil, but Mrs. Jewls also noticed that Jason was quieter than he\u0027d ever been. I should tape all their mouths shut, she thought. Then they\u0027d all be so nice and quiet. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was such a good idea, she wondered why no other teacher had ever thought of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56869.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
