In fact, just to be safe, don\u0027t read this story if you\u0027re ever planning to eat again. Miss Mush wiped her hands on her apron. She smiled at the children who were lined up at the cafeteria. It warmed her heart to see how much they liked her food. 49 Maurecia was first in line. \"And what would you like today, Maurecia?\" Miss Mush asked. She knew the name of every child in Wayside School. Maurecia looked at the sign. Special Today: Mushroom Surprise \"Just milk,\" said Maurecia. \"I brought my lunch.\" Miss Mush smiled and gave Maurecia a carton of milk. Joy was next in line. \"And what would you like, Joy?\" asked Miss Mush. \"Milk,\" said Joy. Miss Mush smiled and gave Joy a carton of milk. \"And what would you like, Jason?\" \"Milk, please,\" said Jason. \"Just milk,\" said Dameon. \"Milk,\" said D.J. \"Milk,\" said Leslie. It was almost Ron\u0027s turn. He hadn\u0027t brought a lunch. He normally brought a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to school, but there hadn\u0027t been a single slice of bread in his house this morning. \"I know!\" his mother had said. \"Ill give you some money and you can buy a nice hot lunch from Miss Mush!\" She thought it was a brilliant idea. 50 \"Can\u0027t I just have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the bread?\" Ron had asked. Now he looked up at the sign. Special Today: Mushroom Surprise He wished he weren\u0027t so hungry. This was the eighteenth day in a row that the special was Mushroom Surprise. It was called Mushroom Surprise because it would have been a surprise if anybody had ever ordered it. No one ever did- except Louis, of course. That\u0027s why they\u0027d had it for eighteen days. There was always plenty left over. \"Milk,\" said Terrence. \"Milk,\" said Sharie. \"Milk,\" said Calvin. \"Milk, please,\" said Bebe. \"And what would you like today, Ron?\" asked Miss Mush. Ron took a breath. \"Mushroom Surprise,\" he squeaked. Tears of joy filled Miss Mush\u0027s eyes. She blew her nose on her apron, then said, \"One Mushroom Surprise, coming right up!\" Tears came to Ron\u0027s eyes too, but for a different reason. He looked at the Mushroom Surprise. It was sort of green. So was Ron. 51 Miss Mush proudly dumped a hot lump of Mushroom Surprise on a paper plate and handed it to Ron. He put it on his tray, then pushed it over to the cash register, where he paid for it. The news quickly spread around the cafeteria, then up and down the stairs and out to the playground. \"Ron ordered the Mushroom Surprise!\" \"Ron ordered the Mushroom Surprise!\" Mrs. Jewls was sitting in the teachers\u0027 lounge on the twelfth floor when Bebe burst into the room. All the teachers were shocked to see her. \"Bebe, you\u0027re not allowed in here,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"This is a secret place.\" \"Ron ordered the Mushroom Surprise!\" Bebe shouted; then she ran back up to the cafeteria. As Ron sat down at a table, eighty-seven kids crowded around him to watch him eat. \"I wonder what the surprise is,\" said Deedee. She had the best view. She was pushed right up alongside Ron\u0027s chair. \"Maybe it tastes good,\" said Leslie. \"Maybe that\u0027s the surprise.\" \"No, I think it\u0027s called Mushroom Surprise because after you eat it, it\u0027s a surprise if you don\u0027t die,\" said Mac. \"Louis eats it. He\u0027s not dead,\" said Jason. \"Louis has been eating Miss Mush\u0027s food for so long, he\u0027s immune to it,\" said Allison. 52 Ron dug his plastic fork into the goop. He raised it to his mouth. Dana covered her eyes. \"I can\u0027t watch!\" she exclaimed. Ron opened his mouth wide. The fork entered. He brought the fork out again. It was empty! Ron chewed twice, then swallowed. \"He ate it!\" Deedee announced for those who couldn\u0027t see. Stephen screamed. \"Hmm,\" said Ron. \"Not too bad. It sort of tastes like a mixture of bananas and spinach.\" \"What\u0027s the surprise?\" asked Deedee. Ron looked at Deedee. His face flushed and his eyes changed color. His whole body began to shake, like a washing machine on the spin cycle. Deedee was afraid he was going to throw up. She tried to get away, but with everyone crowded around, there was no room for her to move. But Ron didn\u0027t throw up. He stood up, put his arms around Deedee\u0027s neck, and kissed her smack on the lips. He sat back down. His eyes returned to their normal color. \"Ylah!\" said Deedee, wiping her mouth on her sleeve. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Ron. 53 \"Don\u0027t you know what you just did?\" asked Allison. He shrugged. \"I ate some Mushroom Surprise. It wasn\u0027t bad. Sort of like a mixture of a hot dog and grape jelly. I wonder what the surprise is.\" He dug his plastic fork back into the goop. Everybody ran away. When Mrs. Jewls entered the cafeteria, no one was there except for Ron. He was sitting alone at a table eating Mushroom Surprise. Mrs. Jewls sat down next to him. \"Hi Ron,\" she said. \"So how does it taste? And what\u0027s the surprise?\" Ron swallowed another mouthful. He looked at his teacher. His face flushed and his eyes changed color. . . .","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56866.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
