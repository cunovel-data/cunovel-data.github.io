{"id":15483,"no":15,"title":"15. She\u0027s Back! 格芙老师回来了！","content":"Deedee ran across the playground screaming. At first Louis thought she was just having fun, but then he realized something was wrong. He hurried after her and grabbed her arm. \"Deedee, are you all right?\" he asked. She stared at him wide-eyed as she continued to scream. Several other kids gathered around. \"What\u0027s wrong with Deedee?\" asked Myron. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Louis. 84 Deedee hiccupped three times, then gasped, \"I saw her!\" \"Who?\" asked Louis. Deedee didn\u0027t answer-she just stared right through him. But everyone else knew whom Deedee had seen. Most of them had seen her too, during the last two weeks. \"Where was she?\" asked Todd. \"On the monkey bars,\" said Deedee, still trembling and breathing hard. \"I was hanging upside down, and suddenly she was hanging upside down right next to me!\" \"Did she wiggle her ears?\" asked Jenny. \"Only one,\" said Deedee. \"I jumped off and ran away before she could wiggle the other one.\" \"That\u0027s good,\" said Rondi. \"Who is she?\" asked Louis. \"A hippopotamus?\" \"No!\" said Myron with a laugh. \"Why do you say that?\" \"Because when a hippopotamus gets mad, it wiggles its ears.\" \"She\u0027s worse than a hippopotamus,\" said Allison. \"I saw her last week, at the water fountain,\" said Todd. \"I bent down to get a drink, and then there she was, drinking at the faucet next to me.\" \"I saw her on the stairs,\" said Rondi. \"I was going up the stairs, and she went right past me, sliding down on the banister.\" 85 \"Who?\" asked Louis. \"Mrs. Gorf!\" said Deedee. Just saying the name sent a shiver of fear through her body. \"Oh, your old teacher,\" said Louis with a shrug. \"Is she back? I always wondered what happened to her.\" The children looked at each other. Mrs. Gorf was the teacher they had had before Mrs. Jewls took over. They had never told anyone how they had gotten rid of her. They especially couldn\u0027t tell Louis. She was the meanest teacher in the history of Wayside School. Of course there are other teachers at other schools who are meaner. Louis looked toward the monkey bars. \"I don\u0027t see her,\" he said. \"Well, she was there,\" Deedee insisted. \"I saw her!\" \"You just imagined you saw her, Deedee,\" said Louis. \"If you hate somebody, or if you love somebody, you often think you see that person when she isn\u0027t there. It\u0027s very common. It\u0027s just like Mrs. Drazil.\" \"Who\u0027s Mrs. Drazil?\" asked Todd. \"She was the worst teacher I ever had,\" said Louis. He shivered just thinking about her. \"She was my teacher when I was your age. I sometimes think I see her, too. And I still have nightmares about her.\" \"Was she mean?\" asked Rondi. \"She was horribler said Louis. \"Every morning she used to check our fingernails. If they were dirty, she\u0027d tell the whole class. \u0027Louis has dirty fingernails this morning,\u0027 she\u0027d say in a really nasty voice. And if you talked in class, she would pick up the wastepaper basket and put it over your head. You had to leave it on your head until the bell rang.\" \"Did she ever put it over your head?\" asked Todd. \"Lots of times,\" said Louis. Everybody laughed. \"It wasn\u0027t funny,\" said Louis. \"My mother always knew when I got in trouble, because I\u0027d have bits of trash stuck in my hair.\" \"Did it get stuck in your mustache, too?\" asked Rondi. \"Louis didn\u0027t have a mustache when he was our age!\" said Allison. \"Did you, Louis?\" she asked. Suddenly, Louis screamed. Everyone stared at him. \"She\u0027s back!\" he shouted, as he shook with fear. Then he slapped himself in the face. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"Sorry. For a second I thought I saw Mrs. Drazil.\" He turned to Deedee. \"C\u0027mon, let\u0027s go to the monkey bars.\" \"No!\" declared Deedee. \"I\u0027m not going back. I\u0027m never getting on the monkey bars again!\" Louis took hold of her hand. \"Mrs. Gorf isn\u0027t there,\" he said. \"You just imagined her.\" They headed to the monkey bars. No one else dared to follow. 87 \"If she starts to wiggle her ears, run away as fast as you can,\" warned Deedee. She held tightly on to Louis\u0027s hand. When they reached the monkey bars, no one was there. \"Where were you when you saw her?\" Louis asked. \"I was hanging upside down over there,\" said Deedee, pointing. \"Okay, go hang upside down,\" said Louis. \"No!\" exclaimed Deedee. \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll be right here in case anything happens.\" It had rained during the night, so the sand under the monkey bars was wet and somewhat hard. Deedee walked across the sand and pulled herself up on the bar. She hooked her legs over, then hung from her knees. \"Well, do you see her?\" Louis asked. ao sjnoq \u0027 Am U33S jsnui i m^u 3.1. noA ssan \\ PT^s ,/AVOU ajBS s.ji \u0027ON,, Deedee pulled herself right side up, then hopped down from the monkey bars. She and Louis walked away hand in hand. She held Louis\u0027s hand not because she was scared, but because she liked him. \"Mrs. Drazil sounds almost as bad as Mrs. Gorf,\" said Deedee. 88 \"She was,\" said Louis. \"She once made me put gum on my nose, because I was chewing it in class.\" \"How can you chew your nose?\" asked Deedee. Behind them, Deedee\u0027s footprints could be seen in the wet sand under the monkey bars. There was also another set of footprints, made by a person who had much bigger feet.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56872.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
