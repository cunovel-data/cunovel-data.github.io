The children were all dressed up in their best clothes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stephen came to school wearing a three-piece suit: gray trousers, a gray vest, and a gray jacket. Underneath his vest was a white shirt and a red and gold striped tie. On his feet were hard, black, shiny shoes. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was very handsome. \\n\\n \\n\\n The other kids laughed when they saw him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve worn lots of silly costumes,\" said Bebe, \"but this is the silliest one yet!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 142 \\n\\n \\n\\n Bebe was wearing yellow shorts, a red shirt with white polka dots, and a floppy green hat. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls rang her cowbell. \"Settle down!\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n The children settled in their seats. Stephen remained standing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look at Stephen,\" said Maurecia. \"His jacket is the same color as his pants.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re supposed to be the same color,\" Stephen tried to explain. \"It\u0027s a suit. And they\u0027re not called pants, they\u0027re called trousers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ooooooh,\" said Maurecia. \"Can you go swimming in your suit?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can go swimming in my suit,\" said Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maurecia had on a black and white striped bikini. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure Stephen\u0027s suit is good for other things,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is,\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Like what?\" asked Todd. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Standing around and looking important,\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What about sitting?\" asked Todd. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not supposed to sit,\" said Stephen. \"The suit might get wrinkled. I\u0027m just supposed to stand around and look important.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Todd. \\n\\n \\n\\n Todd was wearing white shorts, a Hawaiian shirt, and sunglasses. \\n\\n \\n\\n 143 \\n\\n \\n\\n Deedee crawled across the floor to Stephen so she could get a better look at his shoes. \"They\u0027re so shiny!\" she said. \"I can see myself.\" She knocked on one of his shoes with her fist. \"They\u0027re hard, too!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Deedee, get up,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Deedee stood up. She had on a black T-shirt that came down to her knees. In the middle of the shirt was a red heart. Above the heart in sparkling silver and gold letters it said LOVE GODDESS. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I bet they\u0027re good for kickball, huh, Stephen?\" she asked. \"Since they\u0027re so hard.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Stephen. \"I can\u0027t run in them. And they hurt my feet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then why do you wear them?\" asked Deedee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because they\u0027re uncomfortable,\" Stephen explained. \"You have to wear uncomfortable shoes if you want to look important.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Deedee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that thing around your neck?\" asked Paul. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a tie,\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does it keep your neck warm?\" asked Paul. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does it hold your shirt on?\" asked Paul. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, what\u0027s it for?\" asked Paul. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It chokes me,\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Paul. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The more it chokes me, the better I look,\" Stephen explained. \"See?\" He tightened his tie. \\n\\n \\n\\n 144 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yeah,\" said Paul. \"You look real handsome.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Paul was wearing cowboy-and-Indian pajamas. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stephen pulled his tie tighter. \"Now how do I look?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wow, you look great!\" said D. J. \"Pull it tighter!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Stephen pulled his tie even tighter. \"How\u0027s this?\" he gasped. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You look great and very important,\" said D.J. \\n\\n \\n\\n D. J. was wearing a toga made out of his bed sheet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pull it tighter!\" said Bebe. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stephen pulled on his tie. He could no longer breathe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tighter!\" everyone yelled. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stephen pulled it even tighter. His eyes bulged and his nose turned blue. He had never been more handsome. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tighter!\" they all shouted. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stephen pulled his tie so hard that he ripped it in half. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ohhhhhhhhh,\" the whole class groaned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Darn!\" said Stephen. \"Now I\u0027m not great and important anymore.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes you are, Stephen,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You\u0027re just as great and important as you ever were.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am?\" Stephen asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"The tie didn\u0027t make you important. It doesn\u0027t matter what you wear on the outside. It\u0027s what\u0027s underneath that counts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Underneath?\" asked Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n 145 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"If you want to be great and important, you have to wear expensive underpants.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls had on a flowered tank top and a grass skirt. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56881.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
