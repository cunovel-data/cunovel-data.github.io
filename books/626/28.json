The Lost Ear 丢失的耳朵","content":"\\n\\n Mrs. Jewls was teaching the class about mammals. \"All mammals have hair,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bebe raised her hand. \"Is my father a mammal?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, all people are mammals,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But my father doesn\u0027t have any hair,\" said Bebe. \"He\u0027s bald!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Benjamin stared down at his desk top. He was very determined. Mrs. Jewls would be handing out \\n\\n \\n\\n 168 \\n\\n \\n\\n report cards at the end of the week. He had to tell her his real name before then. \\n\\n \\n\\n He raised his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Mac also had his hand raised. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Mac,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I heard about a man who was getting his hair cut,\" said Mac. \"And the barber cut off one of the man\u0027s ears! See, the man had very long hair. I think he was a hippie. So the barber couldn\u0027t see his ear until it fell on the floor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Mac,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"That was a very interesting story.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not finished,\" said Mac. \"When the barber saw the ear on the floor, he said, \u0027Is that your ear on the floor?\u0027 And then the hippie said \u0027What? I can\u0027t hear you.\u0027 So the barber showed him his ear; then he called an ambulance to take the hippie to the hospital.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Were they able to put his ear back on?\" asked Todd. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, see,\" said Mac, \"the doctors were all set to sew it to his head. They were in the operating room and everything. But suddenly they couldn\u0027t find the ear. Man, they looked everywhere for it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did they look under the operating table?\" asked Joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yep,\" said Mac. \"It wasn\u0027t there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How about in the bathroom?\" asked Eric Bacon. \"Maybe they lost it when they washed their hands.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 169 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They looked, but it wasn\u0027t there,\" said Mac. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did they leave it at the barbershop?\" asked Jenny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nope.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did they ever find it?\" asked Allison. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Mac, \"but you\u0027ll never guess where!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the refrigerator,\" grumbled Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, how would it get there?\" asked Mac. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, we really need to get back to mammals,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Yes, Mark.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Benjamin lowered his hand. \"My name\u0027s not Mark,\" he said. \"My name really is Benjamin. Benjamin Nushmutt! And I came from Hempleton, not Magadonia.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fine,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"But we were talking about mammals. Now the whale is the largest mammal. Even though it lives in the ocean, it is still a mammal, not a fish.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do whales have hair?\" asked John. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dana laughed. \"A whale with pigtails!\" she exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Boy, I\u0027d love to pull one of those!\" said Paul. \\n\\n \\n\\n Benjamin couldn\u0027t believe it. \"Didn\u0027t you hear what I just said?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Benjamin,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, don\u0027t you think I\u0027m strange?\" asked Benjamin. \"All this time you\u0027ve been calling me by the \\n\\n \\n\\n 170 \\n\\n \\n\\n wrong name, and I never told you? Don\u0027t you think I\u0027m crazy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Benjamin was getting upset. \"Well, don\u0027t you think it\u0027s a stupid name? Benjamin Nush-mutt!\" He looked around at his classmates. \"Doesn\u0027t anybody think I\u0027m weird?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re not weird!\" said Sharie. \"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s weird. What\u0027s weird is bringing a hobo to school for show-and-tell. I\u0027m the one who\u0027s weird.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s not weird!\" said Bebe. \"What\u0027s weird is telling everyone you have a brother when you don\u0027t. I\u0027m the weirdo!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You call that weird?\" exclaimed Stephen. \"7\u0027m weird. Who else would choke himself just to look nice?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s not weird,\" said Jenny. \"That\u0027s normal. Try reading a story backward. That\u0027s weird. I\u0027m the weird one in this class.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s a laugh!\" said Rondi. \"If you\u0027re so weird, then how come you never asked Louis to kick you in the teeth? I\u0027m the one who\u0027s crazy!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, that\u0027s not crazy,\" said Todd. \"Ill tell you what\u0027s crazy. What\u0027s crazy is that we all go to school on the thirtieth floor, and the bathrooms are way down on the first!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 171 \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone agreed with that, even Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Benjamin shook his head. What a bunch of weirdos! he thought. Then he smiled. He felt proud to be in a class where nobody was strange because nobody was normal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, this must be your lunch,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She gave Benjamin the white paper sack that had been sitting on her desk since Benjamin\u0027s first day of school. \\n\\n \\n\\n At lunch Allison headed down the stairs. \"Mark!\" she exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hi, Allison,\" said Mark Miller. \"Long time no see.\" He carried a white paper sack just like Benjamin\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n Allison was afraid she was back on the nineteenth story. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" said Mark. \"Suddenly everyone realized my name was Mark Miller and not Benjamin Nushmutt. And then Miss Zarves gave me this bag and told me to take it to the hospital.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it your lunch?\" asked Allison. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look inside,\" said Mark. He handed her the bag. \\n\\n \\n\\n Allison looked inside. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was an ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n Allison\u0027s eyes lit up. \"Oh, now I get it!\" she exclaimed. \"I understand everything! There is no Miss Zarves! See, Mac was talking about the ear, then Mark Miller, I mean Benjamin Nushmutt, said \\n\\n \\n\\n 172 \\n\\n \\n\\n his name wasn\u0027t Mark Miller, so that means you-\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What?\" asked Mark. \\n\\n \\n\\n Allison suddenly looked very confused. \"Never mind,\" she mumbled. \\n\\n \\n\\n For just a second Allison had understood everything, but then she lost it. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56885.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
