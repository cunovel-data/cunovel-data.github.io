{"id":15472,"no":4,"title":"4. Homework 家庭作业","content":"Mrs. Jewls was teaching the class about fractions and decimals. She explained that .5 was the same as 1/2. Mac raised his hand. Mrs. Jewls pretended not to see him. \"Ouch! Ouch!\" Mac groaned as he stretched his hand so high that it hurt. Mrs. Jewls pretended not to hear him. Jenny raised her hand. 19 \"Yes, Jenny?\" said Mrs. Jewls, glad to call on anyone besides Mac. \"Mac has his hand raised,\" said Jenny. \"Um, thank you, Jenny,\" muttered Mrs. Jewls. \"Yes, Mac, what is it?\" \"I couldn\u0027t find one of my socks this morning,\" said Mac. \"Man, I looked everywhere! In my closet, in the bathroom, in the kitchen, but I just couldn\u0027t find it! I asked my mother, but she hadn\u0027t seen it either.\" \"That\u0027s very interesting, Mac,\" Mrs. Jewls said patiently, \"but what does that have to do with decimals?\" \"Because,\" said Mac, \"I only could find half of my socks!\" \"Oh. Right,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Does anybody else have any questions about decimals? Yes, John?\" \"Did you look under the bed?\" asked John. \"That was one of the first places I looked,\" said Mac, \"but it wasn\u0027t there.\" \"Did you check the dirty clothes?\" asked Ron. \"Maybe it was never washed.\" \"I checked,\" said Mac. \"Do you have a dog?\" asked Bebe. \"Maybe your dog took it.\" \"No, my dog doesn\u0027t wear socks,\" said Mac. \"Why didn\u0027t you just put on a different sock?\" asked Allison. \"Even if it didn\u0027t match?\" 20 \"I thought of that,\" said Mac. \"See, but then if I wore a sock that didn\u0027t match, I\u0027d be left with only one sock of that color for tomorrow. And then if I wore that sock, I\u0027d have to wear a sock that didn\u0027t match with it. And so on for the rest of my life! I would never wear matching socks again.\" \"Well, be that as it may,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"we really need to get back to decimals. Yes, Stephen?\" \"Once I had both my socks on,\" said Stephen, \"but I wasn\u0027t wearing any shoes. My mom had just waxed the floor, too. I slid all around on it like I was skating. It was a lot of fun until I fell against the kitchen table and broke two dishes. Then I got in trouble.\" \"What\u0027s that got to do with my socks?\" Mac asked impatiently. Stephen shrugged. \"Did you ever find your other sock?\" asked Leslie. \"Yep,\" said Mac, \"but you\u0027ll never guess where. In the refrigerator!\" He held out his arms in bewilderment. \"How did it get there?\" No one knew. \"See, here it is,\" said Mac. He climbed on top of his desk so everyone could see his feet. He pointed to his left foot and said, \"This is the sock I had from the beginning.\" He pointed to his right foot and said, \"And this is the sock I couldn\u0027t find.\" His socks were red with gold lightning bolts down the side. 21 \"Ooh, hot socks!\" said Mauricio. \"No, it was cold after being in the refrigerator,\" said Mac, still standing on top of his desk. \"I made it up a song, too, while I was looking for it. You want to hear it?\" He sang: \"I got one sock! Lookin\u0027 for the other. One sock! Lookin\u0027 for its brother. When I find that sock! I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll put it on my foot, and I\u0027ll stick it in my shoe!\" The bell rang for recess. \"Since we didn\u0027t finish the arithmetic lesson,\" said Mrs. Jewls, \"you\u0027ll have to do the rest of it for homework.\" All the kids groaned as they headed outside. After recess was science. Mrs. Jewls was teaching the class about dinosaurs. She told the class that there were two types of dinosaurs; those that ate meat, and those that ate only vegetables. \"You mean like broccoli?\" asked Rondi. \"I don\u0027t think they had broccoli back then,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Just as there were different kinds of 22 animals back then, there were also different kinds of vegetables.\" Mac raised his hand. Mrs. Jewls pretended not to see him. \"Ooh! Ooh!\" Mac groaned. He looked like he was going to explode. Mrs. Jewls pretended not to hear him. She called on Myron. \"Mac has his hand raised,\" said Myron. \"Um, thank you, Myron,\" muttered Mrs. Jewls. \"Yes, Mac?\" \"My uncle grew the biggest watermelon you ever saw in your whole life. Man, it was huge! It was so heavy I couldn\u0027t even lift it.\" \"Mac, what does this have to do with dinosaurs?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"Because that must have been the kind of watermelon that dinosaurs ate,\" said Mac. \"Did you eat it?\" asked D. J. \"Not all of it,\" said Mac, shaking his head. \"Whew, it was too big for me, and I love watermelon!\" \"What did it taste like?\" asked Maurecia. \"Delicious!\" said Mac. \"But lots of seeds. You shouldn\u0027t eat the seeds. Otherwise a watermelon might grow inside your stomach. I once heard about a lady who was so fat that everyone thought she was going to have a baby. But she didn\u0027t have a baby. She had a watermelon!\" \"Was it a boy or a girl?\" asked Joy. 23 Everyone laughed. Mrs. Jewls never finished her lesson about dinosaurs, so she had to assign it for homework. After school Mac walked home with his girlfriend. Nancy. Nancy\u0027s class was on the twenty-third floor of Wayside. Mac carried his arithmetic book, his science book, his reading book, his language book, and his spelling book. Nancy didn\u0027t have any books. \"Ill carry your books for you, Mac,\" she offered. Mac gave Nancy his books. \"Don\u0027t you have any homework?\" he asked. She shook her head. \"Man, it\u0027s unfair,\" said Mac. \"Mrs. Jewls assigns more homework than any other teacher in Wayside School.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56861.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
