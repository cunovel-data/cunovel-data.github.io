When she finished, she threw up. \"Okay,\" said Jenny. \"So read the story backward,\" suggested Mrs. Jewls. \"That way the beginning will be a surprise.\" \"But I already know how the story ends!\" Jenny complained. \"I only like stories with surprise endings.\" 96 \"Good point,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Here, you can read the story yourself. It\u0027s very funny.\" She gave the book to Jenny. \"All I heard was the last sentence,\" said Jenny. \"It isn\u0027t funny unless you know what happened first.\" \"Why aren\u0027t you laughing, Jenny?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"Didn\u0027t you think it was a funny story?\" That made Dana laugh harder. \"There goes the giggle box,\" said Myron. Everybody laughed, except for Jenny. Dana laughed hysterically. Mrs. Jewls looked back at the story she had been reading before Jenny\u0027s interruption. There was only one sentence left for her to read. She read it to the class. Jenny made a face. She could still taste the awful stuff. \"And next time you 11 drink your prune juice more quickly,\" said Mrs. Jewls. Jenny sat down. Mrs. Jewls waited for Jenny to sit down. Jenny wrote her name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE. \"Well, that\u0027s no excuse,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Now, go write your name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.\" \"I couldn\u0027t leave the table until I finished it,\" explained Jenny. \"And then I missed the bus.\" 97 \"What does prune juice have to do with anything?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"Because I hate prune juice!\" Jenny griped. \"Why are you late?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"I can\u0027t hear you,\" said Jenny. \"I better take off my helmet.\" She took off her helmet. \"Take off your helmet,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"What?\" asked Jenny. \"Why are you late?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. Jenny caught her breath. \"What?\" she asked. She couldn\u0027t hear too well because she was still wearing the motorcycle helmet. Mrs. Jewls looked up from the story she had been reading to the class. \"You\u0027re late,\" she said. She hopped off the bike in front of Wayside School and charged up the stairs. Her stomach was still going up and down as she opened the door to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room. She put on her helmet; then her father drove her to school on the back of his motorcycle. It was a very bumpy ride. \"Put on your helmet,\" said her father. \"Ill drive you to school on the back of my motorcycle.\" \"I missed the bus,\" Jenny grumbled. \"What are you doing home?\" asked her mother. She finally got it all down, then hurried as fast as she could to the bus stop. When she got there, the bus was just pulling away. She sighed, then turned around and ran all the way back home. 98 Her mother wouldn\u0027t let her leave the breakfast table until she finished her prune juice. It took her forever. She hated prune juice more than anything in the world. One day Jenny was late for school.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56874.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
