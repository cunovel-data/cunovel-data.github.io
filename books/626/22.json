{"id":15490,"no":22,"title":"23. Teeth 长新牙","content":"Something terrible happened. Rondi grew two new front teeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi was afraid nobody would think she was cute anymore. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls was giving a health lesson. \"Always brush your teeth,\" she said, \"and remember to scrub behind your ears.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I\u0027ll get toothpaste in my ear!\" exclaimed Todd. \\n\\n \\n\\n 132 \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone laughed. Except Rondi. She didn\u0027t want anybody to see her teeth. She hadn\u0027t smiled for a week. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls made Todd write his name on the board under the word DISCIPLINE. \\n\\n \\n\\n At recess Rondi decided to tell Louis her problem. \\n\\n \\n\\n Louis was talking to Deedee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you have any green balls left?\" asked Deedee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027ve already given them all away,\" said Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s not fair!\" said Deedee. \"Why don\u0027t you ever save one for me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know I can\u0027t do that,\" said Louis. \"If I save a ball for you, then all the other kids will want me to save balls for them, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thanks for nothing, Louis!\" said Deedee. She stormed away. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was Rondi\u0027s turn. She made sure nobody else was listening. \"Louis, will you help me?\" she whispered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure, Rondi, what\u0027s the problem?\" asked Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi smiled, showing Louis her teeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very nice,\" said Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And listen to this,\" said Rondi. \"She sells sea-shells by the seashore.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good,\" said Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No it isn\u0027t!\" complained Rondi. \"I used to whistle when I said words with s\u0027s in them. Now nobody will think I\u0027m cute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 133 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think you\u0027re cute,\" said Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t count,\" said Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, thanks a lot,\" said Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean it bad,\" said Rondi. \"You think everybody\u0027s cute, even Miss Mush! That\u0027s why I like you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Rondi. I like you, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Rondi. \"Will you please kick me in the teeth?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not?\" asked Rondi. \"You said you liked me. If you liked me, you\u0027d kick me in the teeth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know I can\u0027t,\" said Louis. \"If I kick you in the teeth, than all the other kids will want me to kick them in the teeth too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi scowled. \"Thanks for nothing, Louis!\" she said. She crawled into the bushes where nobody would be able to see her mouth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Louis! Louis!\" shouted Stephen and Jason as they ran toward him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Terrence stole our ball!\" said Jason. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish you children would learn to share,\" said Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Make him give it back!\" said Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Louis started to say something, then stopped. He twirled his multicolored mustache. \"Hey, Rondi,\" he called. \"Will you help me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi crawled out of the bushes. \"You wouldn\u0027t help me,\" she said. \"Why should I help you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 134 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Terrence stole their ball,\" said Louis. \"Make him give it back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Her?\" asked Stephen and Jason. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me?\" asked Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n Louis winked at her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi\u0027s eyes lit up. \"Okay, Louis,\" she said. \"That\u0027s a good idea. That\u0027s a wonderful idea!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She hurried across the playground. Stephen and Jason ran after her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Terrence kicked a red ball up into the air, then ran under it and caught it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, Terrence!\" said Rondi. \"That\u0027s not your ball. You stole it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"drop dead, Ketchup Head,\" said Terrence. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi walked up to him, stared him straight in the eye, and said, \"In your hat, Muskrat!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That surprised Terrence. He took a step back. Then he collected himself and said, \"Dig a hole, Milly Mole!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi took another step toward him. \"Kiss a goose, Dr. Seuss!\" she replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n Terrence looked around. A group of kids had formed a circle around them. \"Go to jail, Garbage Pail!\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi held her ground. \"Go to the zoo, Mr. Magoo!\" she retorted. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone was very impressed by how brave Rondi was. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, give me the ball!\" she demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n 135 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You want it?\" asked Terrence. \"Ill give it to you all right!\" He raised his fist in the air. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good, let me have it!\" said Rondi. She smiled, showing him her two new teeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n Terrence shook his fist at her. \"You\u0027re asking for it,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right!\" said Rondi. \"I am.\" Her teeth gleamed at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Terrence brought his fist way back behind him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi closed her eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, look!\" exclaimed Bebe. \"Rondi\u0027s got new teeth!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re cute,\" said Jenny. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rondi opened her eyes. \"You think so?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, you were cuter before,\" said Paul. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think she\u0027s cuter now,\" said Todd. \\n\\n \\n\\n They took a vote. Twelve kids thought she looked cuter with her two new teeth and twelve thought she looked cuter before. Three thought she should keep just one tooth. \\n\\n \\n\\n So Rondi decided to keep her teeth. They were good for biting carrots. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Uh-oh!\" She suddenly remembered. \\n\\n \\n\\n She ducked just in time. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56879.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
