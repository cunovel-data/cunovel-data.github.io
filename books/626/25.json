{"id":15493,"no":25,"title":"26. The Mean Mrs. Jewls 恶毒的朱尔斯老师","content":"Everybody in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class thought she was a very nice teacher. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were wrong. There is no such thing as a nice teacher. \\n\\n \\n\\n If you think you have a nice teacher, then you are wrong too. \\n\\n \\n\\n Inside every nice teacher there is a mean and rotten teacher bursting to get out. The nicer the teacher is on the outside, the meaner the teacher inside is. \\n\\n \\n\\n As Mrs. Jewls was changing the bulletin board \\n\\n \\n\\n 147 \\n\\n \\n\\n before class, a mean and rotten voice whispered inside her brain. \"Give the children lots of busy work today,\" it said. \"And then make them do it over again if their handwriting isn\u0027t perfect.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls tried very hard to ignore the voice. She didn\u0027t like giving busy work. Instead she tried to teach the children three new things every day. She believed that if they learned three new things every day, they would eventually learn everything there is to know. \\n\\n \\n\\n There are some classes where the teachers give so much busy work that the children never learn anything. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you care if the children learn anything?\" asked the mean and rotten voice. \"It\u0027s not your job to teach them. It\u0027s your job to punish them. Keep them in at recess. Hit them with your yardstick!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The bell rang and all the kids scurried to their desks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We are going to learn three new things today,\" Mrs. Jewls announced. \"How to make pickles, seven plus four, and the capital of England.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n All the children paid close attention. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The capital of England is London,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Seven plus four equals eleven. And pickles are made by sticking cucumbers in brine.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n On her desk she had a box of cucumbers and a vat of brine for a demonstration. \\n\\n \\n\\n 148 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Okay, Joe,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"How much is seven plus four?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Joe shrugged. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I just told you, Joe,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Weren\u0027t you listening?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Joe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Okay, who can tell me how pickles are made? Yes, Jason.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eleven!\" Jason declared. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls frowned. \"That\u0027s a correct answer,\" she said, \"but unfortunately I didn\u0027t ask the right question. Can anyone tell me how pickles are made? Yes, Bebe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In London,\" said Bebe. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose they make some pickles in London,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Okay, let\u0027s start again. Calvin, what\u0027s the capital of England?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Could you write England on the board?\" asked Calvin. \"I can do a lot better when I can see the question.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls wrote England on the board. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, okay,\" said Calvin, now that he saw the question. \"The capital of England is E.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s one capital of England,\" Mrs. Jewls had to admit. \"Okay, I will say it one more time. The capital of England is London.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that where they make all the pickles?\" asked Jenny. \\n\\n \\n\\n 149 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, they don\u0027t make all the pickles in London,\" explained Allison. \"Just eleven.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, where do they make the rest of the pickles?\" asked Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shut up!\" shouted Mrs. Jewls. \"Well, that does it. You\u0027re all staying inside for recess!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone stared at her. Mrs. Jewls had never told anyone to shut up. It was against the class rules for anyone to use that expression. If you did, you had to write your name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls put her hand over her mouth, then took it away. \"Oh dear, I\u0027m very sorry,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know what came over me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She wrote her own name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps you\u0027ll learn the lesson better if you write it down,\" she suggested. \"Everyone please take out a piece of paper and a pickle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pencil!\" snapped Mrs. Jewls. \"I meant to say pencil. It just came out pickle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know pickles came from pencils,\" said Jenny. \"I thought they came from cucumbers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought they came from London,\" said Todd. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls made an ugly face. \"Todd, didn\u0027t I just tell you to shut up?\" she asked. She picked up her \\n\\n \\n\\n 150 \\n\\n \\n\\n yardstick and held it over Todd\u0027s head. \"Well, answer me!\" she demanded. \"Didn\u0027t I tell you to shut up?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Todd. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How dare you talk back to me!\" snapped Mrs. Jewls. \"Didn\u0027t I just tell you to shut up?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Todd kept his mouth shut. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, answer me!\" she demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n Todd didn\u0027t know what to do. He nodded his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keep still!\" ordered Mrs. Jewls. \"Now I don\u0027t want you to say another word, is that clear?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Todd stared at her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that clear?\" she asked again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" Todd said meekly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls slammed down the yardstick. Todd quickly moved out of the way. The yardstick banged against his desk and broke in half. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls stared at the eighteen inches she held in her hand. \"Oh my goodness,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry, Todd. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the matter with me today. I must have gotten up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She put a check next to her name under the word DISCIPLINE. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Okay, let me try to make this very simple,\" she said. \"If I have seven cucumbers. And then I get \\n\\n \\n\\n 151 \\n\\n \\n\\n four more cucumbers. And then I drop all the cucumbers in brine and take them to the capital of England. What do I have? How many? And where am I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Huh?\" said D.J. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What?\" asked John. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Could you write the question on the board, please?\" asked Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shut up!\" Mrs. Jewls yelled a third time. In a mocking voice she said, \" \u0027Could you write the question on the board, please?\u0027 You kids think you are so cute! Well, we\u0027ll see just how cute you really are.\" She picked up the vat of brine from her desk. \"How would you like it if I poured this on your heads? You won\u0027t be so cute when you\u0027re all shriveled up and covered with warts, like pickles!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She walked up and down the aisles carrying the pickle juice and glaring at the children. \\n\\n \\n\\n No one dared make a sound. \\n\\n \\n\\n She stopped next to Leslie. \"How about you, Leslie?\" she asked. \"How would you like pickled pigtails?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Leslie trembled. Her pigtails wiggled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m going to ask you three questions, Leslie,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"And if you don\u0027t answer them all correctly, I\u0027m going to dump this on your head.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Leslie gulped. \\n\\n \\n\\n 152 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Question one,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"How much is seven plus four?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Leslie quickly tried to count on her fingers but she didn\u0027t have enough. \"Eleven?\" she guessed. \\n\\n \\n\\n A look of disappointment came over Mrs. Jewls\u0027s face. \"Okay, question two: What is the capital of England?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"L-London,\" Leslie said nervously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rats!\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Okay, question three.\" She looked down at the vat of brine she was holding and shook her head. She thought a moment, then smiled. \"What is the name of my cousin who lives in Vermont?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Leslie had no idea, so she just had to take a wild guess. She closed her eyes and said, \"Fred Jewls?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wrong!\" exlaimed Mrs. Jewls. She raised the vat of brine high above Leslie\u0027s head and started to tip it over. \\n\\n \\n\\n Paul jumped out of his seat. Those pigtails had once saved his life. Now it was his turn to return the favor! \\n\\n \\n\\n He pushed the vat of brine back the other way. He was just trying to push it up straight, but he pushed too hard. It poured all over Mrs. Jewls, drenching her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Paul froze in terror. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls blinked her eyes. Pickle juice dripped \\n\\n \\n\\n 153 \\n\\n \\n\\n down her face. \"Thanks, Paul,\" she said. \"I needed that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The brine had cured her. \\n\\n \\n\\n She circled her name on the blackboard and sent herself home early on the kindergarten bus. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56882.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
