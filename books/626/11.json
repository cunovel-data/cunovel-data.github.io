Kathy and D.J. 凯西和D.F. 铅笔","content":"Down on the playground Kathy was singing her favorite song. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wayside School is falling down, \\n\\n \\n\\n falling down, falling down. Wayside School is falling down, my fair lady, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kids go splat as they hit the ground, \\n\\n \\n\\n hit the ground, hit the ground. Kids go splat as they hit the ground, my fair lady.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 60 \\n\\n \\n\\n D. J. was walking across the playground with his head down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hi, Dr. Jolly,\" said Louis. Louis called D.J. \"Doctor Jolly\" because he was always smiling. \\n\\n \\n\\n But now D.J.\u0027s smile was upside down. He looked up at Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n Louis had never seen such a sad face. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n D.J. just shook his head, then looked back down at the ground and sadly walked away. \\n\\n \\n\\n Louis felt like crying. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, Louis, what\u0027s wrong with D.J.?\" asked Ron. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s so sad!\" said Deedee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Louis, shaking his head. \"Hey, you guys want to play kickball?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No thanks,\" said Deedee. \"I can\u0027t have fun when D.J. is unhappy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me neither,\" said Ron. \\n\\n \\n\\n Across the playground, all the children quit their games when they saw D.J. Nobody could have fun when D.J. looked so sad. \\n\\n \\n\\n Except Kathy! She sang: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Broken bones and blood and gore, blood and gore, blood and gore. Broken bones and blood and gore, my fair lady. \\n\\n \\n\\n 61 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have no school no more, \\n\\n \\n\\n school no more, school no more. We don\u0027t have no school no more, my fair lady.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The bell rang. D.J. sadly looked up at the school and sighed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, Deej, snap out of it,\" said Myron. \\n\\n \\n\\n D.J. stared through his friend. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You want to walk up the stairs with us, Dojo?\" asked Dameon. \\n\\n \\n\\n D.J. shook his head. \"I need to be alone,\" he mumbled. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dameon and Myron looked at each other, then started up the stairs, leaving their sad friend behind. \\n\\n \\n\\n D.J. headed on up, but stopped halfway between the ninth and tenth floors and sat down. He lowered his face into his hands and cried. \\n\\n \\n\\n A moment later someone burst out laughing. \\n\\n \\n\\n D.J. opened his eyes and saw Kathy standing over him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You shouldn\u0027t sit on the stairs, Dumb Jerk!\" said Kathy with glee. \"I almost kicked you in the head.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy always called D.J. \"Dumb Jerk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She didn\u0027t like D.J. because he was always smiling. Now she was glad to see him so sad. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hi, Kathy,\" said D.J. \\n\\n \\n\\n She plopped down on the stair next to him. \"What \\n\\n \\n\\n 62 \\n\\n \\n\\n happened?\" she asked. \"Did your dog die?\" She laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n D. J. shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are your parents getting divorced?\" she asked hopefully. \"Did your house burn down?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said D.J. \"My great-grandfather gave me a gold watch. It was over a hundred years old. I brought it to school today and-\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You lost it!\" Kathy exclaimed with delight. \\n\\n \\n\\n D.J. sadly nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy laughed. \"Oh boy, are you going to get in trouble!\" She rubbed her hands together. \"Your parents will ground you forever!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, my parents never punish me,\" said D.J. \"They know I learn from my mistakes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Kathy, a little disappointed. \"But your great-grandfather will hate you!\" she said. \"And hell never give you another present for the rest of your life. Not even for your birthday!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, he loves me no matter what I do,\" said D.J. \"He likes people, not things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Again Kathy was disappointed. \"But the watch was worth a lot of money,\" she tried. \"And you\u0027ll have to pay for it out of your allowance.\" She laughed triumphantly, sure she had gotten him this time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t get an allowance,\" said D.J. \"I don\u0027t like money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy frowned. Still, she knew there had to be \\n\\n \\n\\n 63 \\n\\n \\n\\n some reason why he was sad about losing the watch. \"You\u0027ll never know what time it is!\" she squawked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So?\" asked D.J. \"Time isn\u0027t real.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy didn\u0027t know what D.J. meant by that, but she didn\u0027t care. \"Well, if you don\u0027t know what time it is,\" she told him, \"you\u0027ll miss all your favorite television shows.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have a favorite television show,\" said D.J. \"I never watch television.\" He thought a moment. \"I\u0027m not sure if we have a TV in our house or not. Maybe there\u0027s one in a closet somewhere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy glared at him. \"Well, then how come you\u0027re so sad you lost that dumb watch?\" she demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid a bird might think it\u0027s food and choke on it,\" said D.J. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that all?\" shrieked Kathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n D.J. smiled. \"I guess you\u0027re right,\" he said. \"A bird probably wouldn\u0027t choke. In fact, maybe he could use it to make a nest. I hope so, don\u0027t you?\" He hopped to his feet. \"Thanks for talking to me, Kathy. I feel a lot better now. You\u0027re a good friend.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He hurried up to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room, taking the stairs two and three at a time. \\n\\n \\n\\n As D.J.\u0027s smile turned up, Kathy\u0027s smile turned down. She followed up after him, grumbling to herself. \"He doesn\u0027t like money. He doesn\u0027t worry about time. He never watches television. Why is he always so happy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n 64 \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class cheered when they saw D. J. enter the room smiling. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy walked in behind him frowning. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls was getting ready to show a movie. She gave D. J. a piece of black construction paper. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, look!\" exclaimed Myron. \"Oddly found a watch!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Oddly, the bird, dropped the watch on the windowsill. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy couldn\u0027t believe it! \"It\u0027s D.J.\u0027s,\" she griped. \\n\\n \\n\\n Myron gave the watch to D. J. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, you can have it, Kathy,\" said D.J. with a big smile. \"It\u0027s worth a lot of money, and this way you won\u0027t miss any of your favorite television shows.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy took the watch from him and put it around her wrist. \"It\u0027ll probably make my skin turn green,\" she groused. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls started the movie projector. Stephen turned off the lights. Dameon pulled down the shades. D.J. held the piece of black construction paper under his nose, because his smile was so bright. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56868.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
