Paul sat in the desk behind Leslie. Once, a long time ago, he had pulled Leslie\u0027s pigtails. It felt great! That is-Paul thought it felt great. Leslie didn\u0027t think it felt too good. But that was earlier in the year, when Paul was younger and immature. Now he knew better. 31 Still, her two long brown pigtails hung in front of his face, all day, every day. The bell rang for recess. \"Leslie,\" said Paul. \"Can I talk to you a second?\" \"Sure, Paul,\" said Leslie. They were alone in the room. All the other kids had rushed down the stairs. Mrs. Jewls had run to the teachers\u0027 lounge. \"I\u0027ve been good, right?\" asked Paul. \"I haven\u0027t pulled one of your pigtails in a long time, have I?\" \"So what do you want, a medal?\" asked Leslie. Paul chuckled. \"No, well, can I ask you something?\" \"Sure,\" said Leslie. Paul took a breath. \"May I pull just one of your pigtails?\" he asked. \"Please?\" \"No!\" said Leslie. \"Please?\" Paul begged. \"I won\u0027t pull it hard. No one will have to know. Please? Please? I wouldn\u0027t ask if it wasn\u0027t important! Please?\" \"You\u0027re sick!\" exclaimed Leslie. Paul lowered his head. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"You\u0027re right. I don\u0027t know what came over me. I won\u0027t ask again.\" \"Good,\" said Leslie. She shook her head in disgust. Paul watched her pigtails waggle. \"Can I just touch one?\" he asked. \"I won\u0027t even pull it. I promise.\" \"No!\" 32 \"What\u0027s wrong with just touching one?\" Paul asked. \"Yuck, you\u0027re gross!\" said Leslie as she turned and marched out of the room. As Paul watched her go, her pigtails seemed to wave good-bye to him. He slapped himself in the face with both hands. What\u0027s wrong with me? he wondered. He walked to the side of the room and leaned over the counter. He stuck his head out the window to get some fresh air. Down below, he could see the kids playing on the playground. They looked like tiny toys. Leslie stepped back into the classroom. \"I\u0027m getting my hair trimmed tomorrow,\" she announced. \"If you want, I\u0027ll save the pieces for you. It\u0027ll just be some split ends.\" Paul was so excited he forgot where he was. He quickly raised his head. It bashed against the window frame, then he bounced forward and toppled out the window. Leslie stared in horror at the open window, then rushed toward it. She leaned over the counter and looked down. \"Help!\" gasped Paul. There was one brick on the side of the building that stuck out a little farther than the others. Paul desperately held on to it with both hands. \"Ill go get Louis,\" said Leslie. \"He\u0027ll save you.\" 33 \"No, don\u0027t go!\" cried Paul. \"I can\u0027t hold on. My fingers are slipping!\" Leslie reached down for him. \"Try to grab my hand,\" she said. Paul made a grab for it, but missed, then quickly clutched the brick. \"I can\u0027t! Help, I\u0027m scared.\" \"Just don\u0027t look down,\" said Leslie as she tried to stay calm. She pulled her head back in through the window. \"Where are you going!\" cried Paul. \"Help! Don\u0027t leave me.\" Leslie looked around Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room for a rope or an extension cord or something for Paul to grab, but she couldn\u0027t find anything. She returned to the window, sighed, then leaned out backward. Her hands tightly held the edge of the counter as she looked up at the sky. \"Grab my pigtails,\" she said, then winced. A big smile came across Paul\u0027s face. \"Really?\" he asked. \"Just do it!\" said Leslie. The pigtails hung about a foot above Paul\u0027s head. He let go of the brick with his right hand and grabbed her right pigtail. \"Yaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!\" Leslie yelped. He grabbed her left pigtail with his left hand. \"Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!\" she screamed. \"Okay, pull me in,\" said Paul. His legs dangled beneath him. 34 Leslie\u0027s eyes watered in pain as she tried to step away from the window. \"I can\u0027t!\" she groaned. \"You\u0027re too heavy.\" Paul swung his legs up against the side of the building. \"Try now.\" Leslie groaned, then took a small step away from the window as Paul took a small step up the wall. Then they each took another small step. At last Paul managed to get one foot on top of the brick that jutted out. Leslie pulled her head inside the window. As she took another step, Paul let go of one pigtail and grabbed the windowsill. Leslie took another step, pulling Paul the rest of the way through. They both collapsed on the floor, tired and sore. \"Ooh, my head hurts,\" said Leslie. \"Wow, you saved my life,\" said Paul. \"Well, don\u0027t worry, someday I\u0027ll save yours.\" \"You don\u0027t have to,\" said Leslie. \"Just don\u0027t pull my pigtails anymore.\" \"I won\u0027t,\" said Paul. Suddenly he laughed. \"What\u0027s so funny?\" asked Leslie. \"This time your pigtails pulled me.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56863.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
