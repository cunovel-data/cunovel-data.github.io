{"id":15487,"no":19,"title":"19. A Bad Case of the Sillies 愚蠢的反面教材","content":"Allison started up the stairs five minutes before the bell rang for school to start. The stairs were completely empty. Allison liked it that way. When the bell rang, the stairs would be crammed with a thousand screaming kids scurrying to their rooms, but now it was nice and peaceful. \n \n She walked up past the eighteenth story and toward the twentieth. There was no nineteenth story in Wayside School. Miss Zarves taught the class on \n \n 106 \n \n the nineteenth story. There was no Miss Zarves. \n \n Allison didn\u0027t understand it. If there was no nineteenth story, then wasn\u0027t her class really on the twenty-ninth? \n \n Suddenly she heard footsteps charging up behind her. She turned around to see Ron and Deedee racing. \n \n She leaned against the wall to get out of their way, but Deedee stamped on her foot; then Ron\u0027s elbow jammed her in the stomach. \n \n \"Umph!\" she grunted, as she fell and rolled down three steps. \n \n Deedee and Ron didn\u0027t even stop to say they were sorry. \n \n Allison slowly stood up. Fortunately she wasn\u0027t hurt, but her windbreaker was torn. \n \n She thought Ron and Deedee were silly. They race up the stairs, and then when they get to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room they\u0027re too pooped to learn anything. \n \n Allison thought all the kids in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class were silly, even Rondi, and Rondi was her best friend. Then there was Jason, who was always pestering her. That was because Jason hated her. Or else he loved her. Allison wasn\u0027t sure which. \n \n When she got to class, Deedee and Ron were sitting with their heads flat on their desks and their tongues hanging out. \n \n \"You could have said you were sorry,\" Allison said \n \n 107 \n \n as she walked past them. She sat up straight in her chair, folded her hands on her desk, and waited as everyone else wandered in. \n \n Jason entered the room carrying a glass bowl with a goldfish swimming inside it. \"Look what I brought!\" he said. \n \n \"What\u0027s the name of your goldfish?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Shark!\" said Jason. \n \n Everyone laughed. Allison rolled her eyes. \n \n \"It makes him feel important,\" Jason explained. \"Where should I put him?\" \n \n \"How about on top of the coat closet?\" suggested Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Jason had to stand on a chair on his tiptoes. He held the bowl at the very bottom as he tried to nudge it over the edge of the closet. \n \n Suddenly the chair toppled over. \"Aaaaaahh-gulp!\" yelled Jason as he fell on the floor. He was holding the bowl upside down above his wet face. \n \n Mrs. Jewls hurried to the back of the room. \"Quick, somebody fill the bowl with water,\" she said. \"Where\u0027s Shark?\" \n \n Jason made a face. \"I swallowed him.\" \n \n The class went crazy. \n \n What a show-off, thought Allison. \n \n Mrs. Jewls rang her cowbell and told everyone to settle down. \"You have a bad case of the sillies this morning,\" she said. \n \n 108 \n \n She took roll. \"Who\u0027s absent?\" she asked. \n \n \"Allison,\" said Rondi. \n \n \"Very funny, Rondi,\" said Allison. \n \n \"Anybody besides Allison?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"I\u0027m here, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Allison. She sat behind Eric Fry, so she thought Mrs. Jewls couldn\u0027t see her. Eric Fry was the biggest kid in the class. \n \n \"Just Allison,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She marked it on her green roll card. \"Dameon, will you please take the roll card to the office.\" \n \n Allison stood up. \"I\u0027m not absent,\" she said. \n \n Dameon took the roll card and walked out the door. \n \n \"Mrs. Jewls, did you just mark me absent?\" asked Allison. \n \n Mrs. Jewls didn\u0027t answer her. \n \n Allison marched to her desk. \"Mrs. Jewls, did you mark me absent?\" she asked again. \n \n Mrs. Jewls looked up. \"Terrence, what are you whispering about?\" \n \n \"Nothing,\" mumbled Terrence. \n \n \"If you can say it to Jenny, you can say it to me,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n \"Get off my case, Buzzard Face!\" said Terrence. \n \n \"Terrence!\" exclaimed Mrs. Jewls. \"Go write your name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.\" \n \n \"But that\u0027s what I said to Jenny,\" Terrence protested. \n \n \"Mrs. Jewls, what about me?\" Allison demanded. \n \n 109 \n \n Mrs. Jewls ignored her. \n \n Allison screamed as loud as she could. \n \n Mrs. Jewls didn\u0027t hear her. \n \n Allison faced the class. \"Can\u0027t anybody see me?\" she asked. \n \n Nobody answered her. \n \n \"Rondi?\" shouted Allison. \"Dana? Jason?\" \n \n \"This isn\u0027t funny,\" said Allison. \"I know you\u0027re all just pretending.\" She stood right in front of Jason, leaned over his desk, and stared him straight in the eye. \"I know you can see me,\" she said. \"You\u0027re trying not to laugh.\" \n \n He stared right through her. \n \n She stuck out her tongue at him. \n \n He leaned forward, causing Allison\u0027s tongue to lick his nose. \n \n \"Yuck!\" she exclaimed, then wiped her tongue on her sleeve. \n \n Mrs. Jewls began the morning lesson. \n \n \"Have you gone crazy?\" shouted Allison. She ran out of the room and down to the class on the twenty-ninth story. \"Come quick,\" she said. \"There\u0027s something wrong with Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class.\" \n \n No one heard her. \n \n She slammed the door, then continued down the stairs to the class on the twenty-eighth floor. No one saw her there, either. \n \n Tears streamed down her cheeks. Is the whole \n \n 110 \n \n school playing a joke on me? she wondered. \"It\u0027s not funny!\" she shouted as loud as she could. \n \n She continued down the stairs, screaming anything that came to her head, hoping that someone, somewhere, would notice her. \n \n \"Fish for sale! Fresh fish! Fat fish! Get your fresh, fat fish!\" \n \n A tall, skinny lady with very short hair stepped out of one of the classrooms. \"Sh!\" she whispered. \"This is a school, not a fish market!\" \n \n \"You can hear me?\" asked Allison. She was so happy, she wanted to hug her. \n \n \"Yes, I can hear you,\" the woman said sternly. \"My whole class can hear you. You\u0027re making it impossible for us to get any work done.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Allison. \"But something\u0027s wrong in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class.\" \n \n \"You\u0027d better come in here,\" said the teacher. \n \n Allison followed the teacher into her classroom. \n \n \"What\u0027s your name?\" the teacher asked her. \n \n \"Allison.\" \n \n \"Boys and girls, this is Allison,\" the teacher announced to her students. \"She\u0027ll be joining our class.\" \n \n \"What?\" said Allison. \"But-\" \n \n \"My name is Miss Zarves,\" said the teacher. \"Welcome to the nineteenth story.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56876.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
