How\u0027d all this junk get here? he wondered. Well, I\u0027m not going to pick it up! \n \n It wasn\u0027t his job to pick up garbage. He was just supposed to pass out the balls during lunch and recess, and also make sure the kids didn\u0027t kill each other. \n \n He sighed, then began cleaning it up. He loved all the children at Wayside School. He didn\u0027t want them playing on a dirty playground. \n \n As he was picking up the pencils and pieces of paper, a large truck drove into the parking lot. It honked its horn twice, then twice more. \n \n Louis ran to the truck. \"Quiet!\" he whispered. \"Children are trying to learn in there!\" He pointed at the school. \n \n A short man with big, bushy hair stepped out of the truck. \"I have a package for somebody named Mrs. Jewls,\" he said. \n \n \"I\u0027ll take it,\" said Louis. \n \n \"Are you Mrs. Jewls?\" asked the man. \n \n \"No,\" said Louis. \n \n \"I have to give it to Mrs. Jewls,\" said the man. \n \n Louis thought a moment. He didn\u0027t want the man disturbing the children. He knew how much they hated to be interrupted when they were working. \n \n \"I\u0027m Mrs. Jewls,\" he said. \n \n \"But you just said you weren\u0027t Mrs. Jewls,\" said the man. \n \n \"I changed my mind,\" said Louis. \n \n The man got the package out of the back of the truck and gave it to Louis. \"Here you go, Mrs. Jewls,\" he said. \n \n \"Uhh!\" Louis grunted. It was a very heavy package. The word FRAGILE was printed on every side. He had to be careful not to drop it. \n \n The package was so big, Louis couldn\u0027t see where he was going. Fortunately, he knew the way to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class by heart. It was straight up. \n \n Wayside School was thirty stories high, with only one room on each story. Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class was at the very top. It was Louis\u0027s favorite class. \n \n He pushed through the door to the school, then started up the stairs. There was no elevator. \n \n There were stairs that led down to the basement, too, but nobody ever went down there. There were dead rats living in the basement. \n \n The box was pressed against Louis\u0027s face, squashing his nose. Even so, when he reached the fifteenth floor, he could smell Miss Mush cooking in the cafeteria. It smelled like she was making mushrooms. Maybe on my way back I\u0027ll stop by Miss Mush\u0027s room and get some mushrooms, he thought. He didn\u0027t want to miss Miss Mush\u0027s mushrooms. They were her specialty. \n \n He huffed and groaned and continued up the stairs. His arms and legs were very sore, but he didn\u0027t want to rest. This package might be important, he thought. I have to get it to Mrs. Jewls right away. \n \n He stepped easily from the eighteenth story to the twentieth. There was no nineteenth story. \n \n Miss Zarves taught the class on the nineteenth story. There was no Miss Zarves. \n \n At last he struggled up the final step to the thirtieth story. He knocked on Mrs. Jewls\u0027s door with his head. \n \n Mrs. Jewls was in the middle of teaching her class about gravity when she heard the knock. \"Come in,\" she called. \n \n \"I can\u0027t open the door,\" Louis gasped. \"My hands are full. I have a package for you.\" \n \n Mrs. Jewls faced the class. \"Who wants to open the door for Louis?\" she asked. \n \n All the children raised their hands. They loved to be interrupted when they were working. \n \n \"Oh dear, how shall I choose?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"I have to be fair about this. I know! We\u0027ll have a spelling bee. And the winner will get to open the door.\" \n \n Louis knocked his head against the door again. \"It\u0027s heavy,\" he complained. \"And I\u0027m very tired.\" \n \n \"Just a second,\" Mrs. Jewls called back. \"Allison, the first word\u0027s for you. Heavy.\" \n \n \"Heavy,\" said Allison. \"H-E-A-V-Y. Heavy.\" \n \n \"Very good. Jason, you\u0027re next. Tired.\" \n \n \"Tired,\" said Jason. \"S-L-E-E-P-Y. Tired.\" \n \n Louis felt the package slipping from his sweaty fingers. He shifted his weight to get a better grip. The comers of the box dug into the sides of his arms. He felt his hands go numb. \n \n Actually, he didn\u0027t feel them go numb. \n \n \"Jenny, package.\" \n \n \"Package,\" said Jenny. \"B-O-X. Package.\" \n \n \"Excellent!\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Louis felt like he was going to faint. \n \n At last John opened the door. \"I won the spelling bee, Louis!\" he said. \n \n \"Very good, John,\" muttered Louis. \n \n \"Aren\u0027t you going to shake my hand?\" asked John. \n \n Louis shifted the box to one arm, quickly shook John\u0027s hand, then grabbed the box again and staggered into the room. \n \n \"Where do you want it, Mrs. Jewls?\" he asked. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"What is it?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Louis. \"Ill have to put it down someplace so you can open it.\" \n \n \"But how can I tell you where to put it until I know what it is?\" asked Mrs. Jewls. \"You might put it in the wrong place.\" \n \n So Louis held the box as Mrs. Jewls stood on a chair next to him and tore open the top. His legs wobbled beneath him. \n \n \"It\u0027s a computer!\" exclaimed Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Everybody booed. \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Louis. \"I thought everyone loved computers.\" \n \n \"We don\u0027t want it, Louis,\" said Eric Bacon. \n \n \"Take it back, Jack,\" said Terrence. \n \n \"Get that piece of junk out of here,\" said Maurecia. \n \n \"Now, don\u0027t be that way, said Mrs. Jewls. \"The computer will help us learn. It\u0027s a lot quicker than a pencil and paper.\" \n \n \"But the quicker we learn, the more work we have to do,\" complained Todd. \n \n \"You may set it over there on the counter, Louis,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Louis set the computer on the counter next to Sharie\u0027s desk. Then he collapsed on the floor. \n \n \"Now watch closely,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Everyone gathered around the new computer. It had a full-color monitor and two disk drives. \n \n Mrs. Jewls pushed it out the window. \n \n They all watched it fall and smash against the sidewalk. \n \n \"See?\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"That\u0027s gravity.\" \n \n \"Oh, now I get it!\" said Joe. \n \n \"Thank you, Louis,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027ve been trying to teach them about gravity all morning. We had been using pencils and pieces of paper, but the computer was a lot quicker.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56858.html","bookId":626,"book":{"id":626,"title":"歪歪小学：我们的学校要倒了 Wayside School is Falling Down","description":"简介： 你见过用袜子解答数学问题吗？你知道惊喜蘑菇这道菜到底有多惊喜吗？你知道怎么倒着讲故事吗？你知道怎么到不存在的扎芙斯老师班上去吗最神奇的是，在这本书里，歪歪小学竟然在一阵大风里被一群母牛攻占了。这到底是怎么回事呢？歪歪学校里每天都发生着匪夷所思的事，你...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201803/01/09-42-30-53-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM"}}
