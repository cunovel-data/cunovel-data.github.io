{"id":70867,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"No one had questioned him. No one had stopped him. There was that advantage, anyway, in the social isolation of a Technician. He went via the kettle channels to a door to Time and set its controls. There was the chance, of course, that someone would happen along on a legitimate errand and wonder why the door was in use. He hesitated, and then decided to stamp his seal on the marker. A sealed door would draw little attention. An unsealed door in active use would be a nine-day wonder. Of course, it might be Finge who stumbled upon the door. He would have to chance that. Noys was still standing as he had left her. Wretched hours (physiohours) had passed since Harlan had left the 482nd for a lonely Eternity, but he returned now to the same Time, within a matter of seconds, that he had left. Not a hair on Noys\u0027s head had stirred. She looked startled. \"Did you forget something, Andrew?\" Harlan stared at her hungrily, but made no move to touch her. He remembered Finge\u0027s words, and he dared not risk a repulse. He said stiffly, \"You\u0027ve got to do as I say.\" She said, \"But is something wrong, then? You just left. You just this minute left.\" \"Don\u0027t worry,\" said Harlan. It was all he could do to keep from taking her hand, from trying to soothe her. Instead he spoke harshly. It was as though some demon were forcing him to do all the wrong things. Why had he come back at the first available moment? He was only disturbing her by his almost instantaneous return after leaving. (He knew the answer to that, really. He had a two-day margin of grace allowed by the spatio-temporal chart. The earlier portions of that period of grace were safer and yielded least chance of discovery. It was a natural tendency to crowd it as far downwhen as he could. A foolish risk, too, though. He might easily have miscalculated and entered Time before he had left it physiohours earlier. What then? It was one of the first rules he had learned as an Observer: One person occupying two points in the same Time of the same Reality runs a risk of meeting himself. Somehow that was something to be avoided. Why? Harlan knew he didn\u0027t want to meet himself. He didn\u0027t want to be staring into the eyes of another and earlier (or later) Harlan. Beyond that it would be a paradox, and what was it Twissell was fond of saying? \"There are no paradoxes in Time, but only because Time deliberately avoids paradoxes.\") All the time Harlan thought dizzily of all this Noys stared at him with large, luminous eyes. Then she came to him and put cool hands on either burning cheek and said softly, \"You\u0027re in trouble.\" To Harlan her glance seemed kindly, loving. Yet how could that be? She had what she wanted. What else was there? He seized her wrists and said huskily, \"Will you come with me? Now? Without asking any questions? Doing exactly as I say?\" \"Must I?\" she asked. \"You must, Noys. It\u0027s very important.\" \"Then I\u0027ll come.\" She said it matter-of-factly, as though such a request came to her each day and was always accepted. At the lip of the kettle Noys hesitated a moment, then stepped in. Harlan said, \"We\u0027re going upwhen, Noys.\" \"That means the future, doesn\u0027t it?\" The kettle was already faintly humming as she entered it and she was scarcely seated when Harlan unobtrusively moved the contact at his elbow. She showed no signs of nausea at the beginnings of that indescribable sensation of \"motion\" through Time. He was afraid she might. She sat there quietly, so beautiful and so at ease that he ached, looking at her, and gave not the particle of a damn that, by bringing a Timer, unauthorized, into Eternity, he had committed a felony. She said, \"Does that dial show the numbers of the years, Andrew?\" \"The Centuries.\" \"You mean we\u0027re a thousand years in the future? Already?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"It doesn\u0027t feel like it.\" \"I know.\" She looked about. \"But how are we moving?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Noys.\" \"You don\u0027t?\" \"There are many things about Eternity that are hard to understand.\" The numbers on the temporometer marched. Faster and faster they moved till they were a blur. With his elbow Harlan had nudged the speed stick to high. The power drain might cause some surprise in the power plants, but he doubted it. No one had been waiting for him in Eternity when he returned with Noys, and that was nine tenths the battle. Now it was only necessary to get her to a safe place. Again Harlan looked at her. \"Eternals don\u0027t know everything.\" \"And I\u0027m not an Eternal,\" she murmured. \"I know so little.\" Harlan\u0027s pulse quickened. Still not an Eternal? But Finge said... Leave it at that, he pleaded with himself. Leave it at that. She\u0027s coming with you. She smiles at you. What more do you want? But he spoke anyway. He said, \"You think an Eternal lives forever, don\u0027t you?\" \"Well, they call them Etemals, you know, and everyone says they do.\" She smiled at him brightly. \"But they don\u0027t, do they?\" \"You don\u0027t think so, then?\" \"After I was in Eternity a while, I didn\u0027t. People didn\u0027t talk as though they lived forever, and there were old men there.\" \"Yet you told me I lived forever-that night.\" She moved closer to him along the seat, still smiling. \"I thought: who knows?\" He said, without being quite able to keep the strain out of his voice, \"How does a Timer go about becoming an Eternal?\" Her smile vanished and was it his imagination or was there a trace of heightened color in her cheek. She said, \"Why do you ask that?\" \"To find out.\" \"It\u0027s silly,\" she said. \"I\u0027d rather not talk about it.\" She stared down at her graceful fingers, edged with nails that glittered colorlessly in the muted light of the kettle shaft. Harlan thought abstractedly and quite apropos of nothing that at an evening gathering, with a touch of mild ultraviolet in the wall illumination, those nails would glow a soft apple-green or a brooding crimson, depending on the angle she held her hands. A clever girl, one like Noys, could produce half a dozen shades out of them, and make it seem as though the colors were reflecting her moods. Blue for innocence, bright yellow for laughter, violet for sorrow, and scarlet for passion. He said, \"Why did you make love to me?\" She shook her hair back and looked at him out of a pale, grave face. She said, \"If you must know, part of the reason was the theory that a girl can become an Eternal that way. I wouldn\u0027t mind living forever.\" \"I thought you said you didn\u0027t believe that.\" \"I didn\u0027t, but it couldn\u0027t hurt a girl to take the chance. Especially--\" He was staring at her sternly, finding refuge from hurt and disappointment in a frozen look of disapproval from the heights of the morality of his homewhen. \"Well?\" \"Especially since I wanted to, anyway.\" \"Wanted to make love to me?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why me?\" \"Because I liked you. Because I thought you were funny.\" \"Funny!\" \"Well, odd, if you like that better. You always worked so hard not to look at me, but you always looked at me anyway. You tried to hate me and I could see you wanted me. I was sorry for you a little, I think.\" \"What were you sorry about?\" Ue felt his cheeks burning. \"That you should have such trouble about wanting me. It\u0027s such a simple thing. You just ask a girl. It\u0027s so easy to be friendly. Why suffer?\" Harlan nodded. The morality of the 482nd! \"Just ask a girl,\" he muttered. \"So simple. Nothing more necessary.\" \"The girl has to be willing, of course. Mostly she is, if she\u0027s not otherwise engaged. Why not? It\u0027s simple enough.\" It was Harlan\u0027s turn to drop his eyes. Of course, it was simple enough. And nothing wrong with it, either. Not in the 482nd. Who in Eternity should know this better? He would be a fool, an utter and unspeakable fool, to ask her now about earlier affairs. He might as well ask a girl of his own homewhen if she had ever eaten in the presence of a man and how dared she? Instead he said humbly, \"And what do you think of me now?\" \"That you are very nice,\" she said softly, \"and that if you ever relaxed- Won\u0027t you smile?\" \"There\u0027s nothing to smile about, Noys.\" \"Please. I want to see if your cheeks can crease right. Let\u0027s see.\" She put her fingers to the corners of his mouth and pressed them backward. He jerked his head back in surprise and couldn\u0027t avoid smiling. \"See. Your cheeks didn\u0027t even crack. You\u0027re almost handsome. With enough practice-standing in front of a mirror and smiling and getting a twinkle in your eye-I\u0027ll bet you could be really handsome.\" But the smile, fragile enough to begin with, vanished. Noys said, \"We are in trouble, aren\u0027t we?\" \"Yes, we are, Noys. Great trouble.\" \"Because of what we did? You and I? That evening?\" \"Not really.\" \"That was my fault, you know. I\u0027ll tell them so, if you wish.\" \"Never,\", said Harlan with energy. \"Don\u0027t take on any fault in this. You\u0027ve done nothing, nothing, to be guilty for. It\u0027s something else.\" Noys looked uneasily at the temporometer. \"Where are we? I can\u0027t even see the numbers.\" \"When are we?\" Harlan corrected her automatically. He slowed the velocity and the Centuries came into view. Her beautiful eyes widened and the lashes stood out against the whiteness of her skin. \"Is that right?\" Harlan looked at the indicator casually. It was in the 72,000\u0027s. \"I\u0027m sure it is.\" \"But where are we going?\" \"To when are we going. To the far upwhen,\" he said, grimly. \"Good and far. Where they won\u0027t find you.\" And in silence they watched the numbers mount. In silence Harlan told himself over and over that the girl was innocent of Finge\u0027s charge. She had owned up frankly to its partial truth and she had admitted, just as frankly, the presence of a more personal attraction. He looked up, then, as Noys shifted position. She had moved to his side of the kettle and, with a resolute gesture, brought the kettle to a halt at a most uncomfortable temporal deceleration. Harlan gulped and closed his eyes to let the nausea pass. He said, \"What\u0027s the matter?\" She looked ashen and for a moment made no reply. Then she said, \"I don\u0027t want to go any further. The numbers are so high.\" The temporometer read: 111,394. He said, \"Far enough.\" Then he held out his hand gravely, \"Come, Noys. This will be your home for a while.\" They wandered through the corridors like children, hand in hand. The lights along the mainways were on, and the darkened rooms blazed at the touch of a contact. The air was fresh and had a liveliness about it which, without sensible draft, yet indicated the presence of ventilation. Noys whispered, \"Is there no one here?\" \"No one,\" said Harlan. He tried to say it firmly and loudly. He wanted to break the spell of being in a \"Hidden Century,\" but he said it in only a whisper after all. He did not even know how to refer to anything so far upwhen. To call it the one-one-one-three-ninety-fourth was ridiculous. One would have to say simply and indefinitely, \"The hundred thousands.\" It was a foolish problem to be concerned with, but now that the exaltation of actual flight was done with, he found himself alone in a region of Eternity where no human footsteps had wandered and he did not like it. He was ashamed, doubly ashamed since Noys was witness, at the fact that the faint chill within him was the faint chill of a faint fear. Noys said, \"It\u0027s so clean. There\u0027s no dust.\" \"Self-cleaning,\" said Harlan. With an effort that seemed to tear at his vocal cords he raised his voice to near-normal level. \"But no one\u0027s here, upwhen or downwhen for thousands and thousands of Centuries.\" Noys seemed to accept that. \"And everything is fixed up so? We passed food stores and a viewing-film library. Did you see that?\" \"I saw that. Oh, it\u0027s fully equipped. They\u0027re all fully equipped. Every Section.\" \"But why, if no one ever comes here?\" \"It\u0027s logical,\" said Harlan. Talking about it took away some of the eeriness. Saying out loud what he already knew in the abstract would pin-point the matter, bring it down to the level of the prosaic. He said, \"Early in the history of Eternity, one of the Centuries in the 300\u0027s came up with a mass duplicator. Do you know what I mean? By setting up a resonating field, energy could be converted to matter with subatomic particles taking up precisely the same pattern of positions, within the uncertainty requirements, as those in the model being used. The result is an exact copy. \"We in Eternity commandeered the instrument for our own purposes. At that time, there were only about six or seven hundred Sections built up. We had plans for expansion, of course. \u0027Ten new Sections a physioyear\u0027 was one of the slogans of the time. The mass duplicator made that all unnecessary. We built one new Section complete with food, power supply, water supply, all the best automatic features; set up the machine and duplicated the Section once each Century all along Eternity. I don\u0027t know how long they kept it going-millions of Centuries, probably.\" \"All like this, Andrew?\" \"All exactly like this. And as Eternity expands, we just fill in, adapting the construction to whatever fashion turns out to be current in the Century. The only troubles come when we hit an energy-centered Century. We-we haven\u0027t reached this Section yet.\" (No use telling her that the Eternals couldn\u0027t penetrate into Time here in the Hidden Centuries. What difference did that make?) He glanced at her and she seemed troubled. He said hastily, \"There\u0027s no waste involved in building the Sections. It took energy, nothing more, and with the nova to draw on-\" She interrupted. \"No. I just don\u0027t remember.\" \"Remember what?\" \"You said the duplicator was invented in the 300\u0027s. We don\u0027t have it in the 482nd. I don\u0027t remember viewing anything about it in history.\" Harlan grew thoughtful. Although she was within two inches of being as tall as himself, he suddenly felt giant-size by comparison. She was a child, an infant, and he was a demigod of Eternity who must teach her and lead her carefully to the truth. He said, \"Noys, dear, let\u0027s find a place to sit down and-and I\u0027ll have to explain something.\" The concept of a variable Reality, a Reality that was not fixed and eternal and immutable was not one that could be faced casually by anyone. In the dead of the sleep period, sometimes, Harlan would remember the early days of his Cubhood and recall the wrenching attempts to divorce himself from his Century and from Time. It took six months for the average Cub to learn all the truth, to discover that he could never go home again in a very literal way. It wasn\u0027t Eternity\u0027s law, alone, that stopped him, but the frigid fact that home as he knew it might very well no longer exist, might, in a sense, never have existed. It affected Cubs differently. Harlan remembered Bonky Latourette\u0027s face turning white and gaunt the day Instructor Yarrow had finally made it unmistakably clear about Reality. None of the Cubs ate that night. They huddled together in search of a kind of psychic warmth, all except Latourette, who had disappeared. There was a lot of false laughter and miserably poor joking. Someone said with a voice that was tremulous and uncertain, \"I suppose I never had a mother. If I go back into the 95th, they\u0027d say: \u0027Who are you? We don\u0027t know you. We don\u0027t have any records of you. You don\u0027t exist.\u0027\" They smiled weakly and nodded their heads, lonely boys with nothing left but Eternity. They found Latourette at bedtime, sleeping deeply and breathing shallowly. There was the slight reddening of a spray injection in the hollow of his left elbow and fortunately that was noted too. Yarrow was called and for a while it looked as though one Cub would be out of the course, but he was brought around eventually. A week later he was back in his seat. Yet the mark of that evil night was on his personality for as long as Harlan knew him thereafter. And now Harlan had to explain Reality to Noys Lambent, a girl not much older than those Cubs, and explain it at once and in full. He had to. There was no choice about that. She must learn exactly what faced them and exactly what she would have to do. He told her. They ate canned meats, chilled fruits, and milk at a long conference table designed to hold twelve, and there he told her. He did it as gently as possible, but he scarcely found need for gentleness. She snapped quickly at every concept and before he was half through it was borne in upon him, to his great amazement, that she wasn\u0027t reacting badly. She wasn\u0027t afraid. She showed no sense of loss. She only seemed angry. The anger reached her face and turned it a glowing pink while her dark eyes seemed somehow the darker for it. \"But that\u0027s criminal,\" she said. \"Who are the Eternals to do this?\" \"It\u0027s done for humanity\u0027s good,\" said Harlan. Of course, she couldn\u0027t really understand that. He felt sorry for the Time-bound thinking of a Timer. \"Is it? I suppose that\u0027s how the mass duplicator was wiped out.\" \"We have copies still. Don\u0027t worry about that. We\u0027ve preserved it.\" \"You\u0027ve preserved it. But what about us? We of the 482nd might have had it.\" She gestured with little movements of two clenched fists. \"It wouldn\u0027t have done you good. Look, don\u0027t be excited, dear, and listen.\" With an almost convulsive gesture (he would have to learn how to touch her naturally, without making the movement seem a sheepish invitation to a repulse) he took her hands in his and held them tightly. For a moment she tried to free them, and then she relaxed. She even laughed a bit. \"Oh, go ahead, silly, and don\u0027t look so solemn. I\u0027m not blaming you.\" \"You mustn\u0027t blame anyone. There is no blame necessary. We do what must be done. That mass duplicator is a classic case. I studied it in school. When you duplicate mass, you can duplicate persons, too. The problems that arise are very complicated.\" \"Isn\u0027t it up to the society to solve its own problems?\" \"It is, but we studied that society throughout Time and it doesn\u0027t solve the problem satisfactorily. Remember that its failure to do so affects not only itself but all its descendant societies. In fact, there is no satisfactory solution to the mass-duplicator problem. It\u0027s one of those things like atomic wars and dreamies that just can\u0027t be allowed. Developments are never satisfactory.\" \"What makes you so sure?\" \"We have our Computing machines, Noys; Computaplexes far more accurate than any ever developed in any single Reality. These Compute the possible Realities and grade the desirabilities of each over a summation of thousands and thousands of variables.\" \"Machines!\" She said it with scorn. Harlan frowned, then relented hastily. \"Now don\u0027t be like that. Naturally, you resent learning that life is not as solid as you thought. You and the world you lived in might have been only a probability shadow a year ago, but what\u0027s the difference? You have all your memories, whether they\u0027re of probability shadows or not, haven\u0027t you? You remember your childhood and your parents, don\u0027t you?\" \"Of course.\" \"Then it\u0027s just as if you lived it, isn\u0027t it? Isn\u0027t it? I mean, whether you did or not?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll have to think about it. What if tomorrow it\u0027s a dream world again, or a shadow, or whatever you call it?\" \"Then there would be a new Reality and a new you with new memories. It would be just as though nothing had happened, except that the sum of human happiness would have been increased again.\" \"I don\u0027t find that satisfying, somehow.\" \"Besides,\" said Harlan hastily, \"nothing will happen to you now. There will be a new Reality but you\u0027re in Eternity. You won\u0027t be changed.\" \"But you say it makes no difference,\" said Noys gloomily. \"Why go to all the trouble?\" With sudden ardor Harlan said, \"Because I want you as you are. Exactly as you are. I don\u0027t want you changed. Not in anyway.\" He came within a hair of blurting out the truth, that without the advantage of the superstition about Eternals and eternal life she would never have inclined toward him. She said, looking about with a slight frown, \"Will I have to stay here forever, then? It would be-lonely.\" \"No, no. Don\u0027t think it,\" he said wildly, gripping her hands so tight that she winced. \"I\u0027ll find out what you will be in the new Reality of the 482nd, and you\u0027ll go back in disguise, so to speak. I\u0027ll take care of you. I\u0027ll apply for permission for formal liaison and see to it that you remain safely through future Changes. I\u0027m a Technician and a good one and I know about Changes.\" He added grimly, \"And I know a few other things as well,\" and stopped there. Noys said, \"Is all this allowed? I mean, can you take people into Eternity and keep them from changing? It doesn\u0027t sound right, somehow, from the things you\u0027ve told me.\" For a moment Harlan felt shrunken and cold in the large emptiness of the thousands of Centuries that surrounded him upwhen and down. For a moment he felt cut off even from the Eternity that was his only home and only faith, doubly cast out from Time and Eternity; and only the woman for whom he had forsaken it all left at his side. He said, and he meant it deeply, \"No, it is a crime. It is a very great crime, and I am bitterly ashamed. But I would do it again, if I had to, and any number of times, if I had to.\" \"For me, Andrew? For me?\" He did not raise his eyes to hers. \"No, Noys, for myself. I could not bear to lose you.\" She said, \"And if we are caught...\" Harlan knew the answer to that. He knew the answer since that moment of insight in bed in the 482nd, with Noys sleeping at his side. But, even yet, he dared not think of the wild truth. He said, \"I am not afraid of anyone. I have ways of protecting myself. They don\u0027t imagine how much I know.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-eternity/page-8.html","bookId":1747,"book":{"id":1747,"title":"The End of Eternity","description":"Storyline: Andrew Harlan is an Eternal, a man whose job it is to range through past and present Centuries, monitoring and, where necessary, altering Time\u0027s myriad cause-and-effect relationships.
