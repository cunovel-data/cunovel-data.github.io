{"id":70863,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Harlan had been two years a Technician when he re-entered the 482nd for the first time since leaving with Twissell. He found it almost unrecognizable.\\n\\n It had not changed. He had.\\n\\n Two years of Technicianhood had meant a number of things. In one sense it had increased his feeling of stability. He had no longer to learn a new language, get used to new styles of clothing and new ways of life with every new Observation project. On the other hand, it had resulted in a withdrawal on his own part. He had almost forgotten now the camaraderie that united all the rest of the Specialists in Eternity.\\n\\n Most of all, he had developed the feeling of the power of being a Technician. He held the fate of millions in his finger tips, and if one must walk lonely because of it, one could also walk proudly.\\n\\n So he could stare coldly at the Communications man behind the entry desk of the 482nd and announce himself in clipped syllables: \"Andrew Harlan, Technician, reporting to Computer Finge for temporary assignment to the 482nd,\" disregarding the quick glance from the middle-aged man he faced.\\n\\n It was what some people called the \"Technician glance,\" a quick, involuntary sidelong peek at the rose-red shoulder emblem of the Technician, then an elaborate attempt not to look at it again.\\n\\n Harlan stared at the other\u0027s shoulder emblem. It was not the yellow of the Computer, the green of the Life-Plotter, the blue of the Sociologist, or the white of the Observer. It was not the Specialist\u0027s solid color at all. It was simply a blue bar on white. The man was Communications, a subbranch of Maintenance, not a Specialist at all.\\n\\n And he gave the \"Technician glance\" too.\\n\\n Harlan said a little sadly, \"Well?\"\\n\\n Communications said quickly, \"I\u0027m ringing Computer Finge, sir.\"\\n\\n Harlan remembered the 482nd as solid and massive, but now it seemed almost squalid.\\n\\n Harlan had grown used to the glass and porcelain of the 575th, to its fetish of cleanliness. He had grown accustomed to a world of whiteness and clarity, broken by sparse patches of light pastel.\\n\\n The heavy plaster swirls of the 482nd, its splashy pigments, its areas of painted metal were almost repulsive.\\n\\n Even Finge seemed different, less than life-size, somewhat. Two years earlier, to Observer Harlan, Finge\u0027s every gesture had seemed sinister and powerful.\\n\\n Now, from the lofty and isolated heights of Technicianhood, the man seemed pathetic and lost. Harlan watched him as he leafed through a sheaf of foils and got ready to look up, with the air of someone who is beginning to think he has made his visitor wait the duly required amount of time.\\n\\n Finge was from an energy-centered Century in the 600\u0027s. Twissell had told him that and it explained a good deal. Finge\u0027s flashes of illtemper could easily be the result of the natural insecurity of a heavy man used to the firmness of field-forces and unhappy to be dealing with nothing more than flimsy matter. His tiptoeing walk (Harlan remembered Finge\u0027s catlike tread well; often he would look up from his desk, see Finge standing there staring at him, his approach having been unheard) was no longer something sly and sneaking, but rather the fearful and reluctant tread of one who lives in the constant, if unconscious, fear that the flooring would break under his weight.\\n\\n Harlan thought, with a pleasant condescension: The man is poorly adjusted to the Section. Reassignment is probably the only thing that would help him.\\n\\n Finge said, \"Greetings, Technician Harlan.\"\\n\\n \"Greetings, Computer,\" said Harlan.\\n\\n Finge said, \"It seems that in the two years since--\"\\n\\n \"Two physioyears,\" said Harlan.\\n\\n Finge looked up in surprise. \"Two physioyears, of course.\"\\n\\n In Eternity there was no Time as one ordinarily thought of Time in the universe outside, but men\u0027s bodies grew older and that was the unavoidable measure of Time even in the absence of meaningful physical phenomena. Physiologically Time passed, and in a physioyear within Eternity a man grew as much older as he would have in an ordinary year in Time.\\n\\n Yet even the most pedantic Eternal remembered the distinction only rarely. It was too convenient to say, \"See you tomorrow,\" or \"I missed you yesterday,\" or \"I will see you next week,\" as though there were a tomorrow or a yesterday or a last week in any but a physiological sense. And the instincts of humanity were catered to by having the activities of Eternity tailored to an arbitrary twenty-four \"physiohour\" day, with a solemn assumption of day and night, today and tomorrow.\\n\\n Finge said, \"In the two physioyears since you left, a crisis has gradually gathered about the 482nd. A rather peculiar one. A delicate one. Almost unprecedented. We need accurate Observation now as we never have needed it before.\"\\n\\n \"And you want me to Observe?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. In a way, it\u0027s a waste of talent to ask a Technician to do a job of Observation, but your previous Observations, for clarity and insight, were perfect. We need that again. Now I\u0027ll just sketch in a few details...\"\\n\\n What those details were Harlan was not to find out just then. Finge spoke, but the door opened, and Harlan did not hear him.\\n\\n He stared at the person who entered.\\n\\n It was not that Harlan had never seen a girl in Eternity before. Never was too strong a word. Rarely, yes, but not never.\\n\\n But a girl such as this! And in Eternity!_\\n\\n Harlan had seen many women in his passages through Time, but in Time they were only objects to him, like walls and balls, barrows and harrows, kittens and mittens. They were facts to be Observed.\\n\\n In Eternity a girl was a different matter. And one like this!_\\n\\n She was dressed in the style of the upper classes of the 482nd, which meant transparent sheathing and not very much else above the waist, and flimsy, knee-length trousers below. The latter, while opaque enough, hinted delicately at gluteal curves.\\n\\n Her hair was glossily dark and shoulder length, her lips redly penciled thin above and full below in an exaggerated pout. Her upper eyelids and her ear lobes were tinted a pale rose and the rest of her youthful (almost girlish) face was a startlingly milky white. Jeweled pendants descended forward from mid-shoulder to tinkle now this side, now that of the graceful breasts to which they drew attention.\\n\\n She took her seat at a desk in the corner of Finge\u0027s office, lifting her eyelashes only once to sweep her dark glance across Harlan\u0027s face.\\n\\n When Harlan heard Finge\u0027s voice again, the Computer was saying, \"You\u0027ll get all this in an official report and meanwhile you can have your old office and sleeping quarters.\"\\n\\n Harlan found himself outside Finge\u0027s office without quite remembering the details of his leaving. Presumably he had walked out.\\n\\n The emotion within him that was easiest to recognize was anger. _By Time_, Finge ought not to be allowed to do this. It was bad for morale. It made a mockery-- He stopped himself, unclenched his fist, unclamped his jaw. Let\u0027s see, now! His footsteps sounded sharply in his own ear as he strode firmly toward the Communications man behind the desk.\\n\\n Communications looked up, without quite meeting his eye, and said cautiously, \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n Harlan said, \"There\u0027s a woman at a desk in Computer Finge\u0027s office. Is she new here?\"\\n\\n He had meant to ask it casually. He had meant to make it a bored, indifferent question. It rang out, instead, like a pair of cymbals clashing.\\n\\n But it roused Communications. The look in his eye became something that made all men kin. It even embraced the Technician, drew him in as a fellow. Communications said, \"You mean the babe? Wow! Isn\u0027t she built like a force-field latrine, though?\"\\n\\n Harlan stammered a bit. \"Just answer my question.\"\\n\\n Communications stared and some of his steam evaporated. He said, \"She\u0027s new. She\u0027s a Timer.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s her job?\"\\n\\n A slow smile crept over Communications\u0027 face and grew into a leer. \"She\u0027s supposed to be the boss\u0027s secretary. Her name is Noys Lambent.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\" Harlan turned on his heel and left.\\n\\n Harlan\u0027s first Observation trip into the 482nd came the next day, but it lasted for thirty minutes only. It was obviously only an orientation trip, intended to get him into the feel of things. He entered it for an hour and a half the next day and not at all on the third.\\n\\n He occupied his time in working his way through his original reports, relearning his own knowledge, brushing up on the language system of the time, accustoming himself to the local costumes again.\\n\\n One Reality Change had hit the 482nd, but it was very minor. A political clique that had been In was now Out, but there seemed no change in the society otherwise.\\n\\n Without quite realizing it he slipped into the habit of searching his old reports for information on the aristocracy. Surely he had made Observations.\\n\\n He had, but they were impersonal, from a distance. His data concerned them as a class, not as individuals.\\n\\n Of course his spatio-temporal charts had never demanded or even permitted him to observe the aristocracy from within. What the reasons for that might have been was beyond the purview of an Observer. He was impatient with himself at feeling curiosity concerning that now.\\n\\n During those three days he had caught glimpses of the girl, Noys Lambent, four times. At first he had been aware only of her clothes and her ornaments. Now he noticed that she was five feet six in height, half a head shorter than himself, yet slim enough and with a carriage erect and graceful enough to give an impression of height. She was older than she first seemed, approaching thirty perhaps, certainly over twenty-five.\\n\\n She was quiet and reserved, smiled at him once when he passed her in the corridor, then lowered her eyes. Harlan drew aside to avoid touching her, then walked on feeling angry.\\n\\n By the close of the third day Harlan was beginning to feel that his duty as an Eternal left him only one course of action. Doubtless her position was a comfortable one for herself. Doubtless Finge was within the letter of the law. Yet Finge\u0027s indiscretion in the matter, his carelessness certainly went against the spirit of the law, and something should be done about it.\\n\\n Harlan decided that, after all, there wasn\u0027t a man in Eternity he disliked quite as much as Finge. The excuses he had found for the man only a few days before vanished.\\n\\n On the morning of the fourth day Harlan asked for and received permission to see Finge privately. He walked in with a determined step and, to his own surprise, made his point instantly. \"Computer Finge, I suggest that Miss Lambent be returned to Time.\"\\n\\n Finge\u0027s eyes narrowed. He nodded toward a chair, placed clasped hands under his soft, round chin, and showed some of his teeth. \"Well, sit down. Sit down. You find Miss Lambert incompetent? Unsuitable?\"\\n\\n \"As to her incompetence and unsuitability, Computer, I cannot say. It depends on the uses to which she is put, and I have put her to none. But you must realize that she is bad for the morale of this Section.\"\\n\\n Finge stared at him distantly as though his Computer\u0027s mind were weighing abstractions beyond the reach of an ordinary Eternal. \"In what way is she hurting morale, Technician?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no real necessity for you to ask,\" said Harlan, his anger deepening. \"Her costume is exhibitionistic. Her--\"\\n\\n \"Wait, wait. Now wait a while, Harlan. You\u0027ve been an Observer in this era. You know her clothes are standard costume for the 482nd.\"\\n\\n \"In her own surroundings, in her own cultural milieu, I would have no fault to find, though I\u0027ll say right now that her costume is extreme even for the 482nd. You\u0027ll allow me to be the judge of that. Here in Eternity, a person such as she is certainly out of place.\"\\n\\n Finge nodded his head slowly. He actually seemed to be enjoying himself. Harlan stiffened.\\n\\n Finge said, \"She is here for a deliberate purpose. She is performing an essential function. It is only temporary. Try to endure her meanwhile.\"\\n\\n Harlan\u0027s jaw quivered. He had protested and was being fobbed off. To hell with caution. He would speak his mind. He said, \"I can imagine what the woman\u0027s \u0027essential function\u0027 is. To keep her so openly will not be allowed to pass.\"\\n\\n He turned stiffly, walked to the door. Finge\u0027s voice stopped him.\\n\\n \"Technician,\" Finge said, \"your relationship with Twissell may have given you a distorted notion about your own importance. Correct that! And meanwhile tell me, Technician, have you ever had a\" (he hesitated, seeming to pick among words) \"girl friend?\"\\n\\n With painstaking and insulting accuracy, back still turned, Harlan quoted: \"In the interest of avoiding emotional entanglements with Time, an Eternal may not marry. In the interest of avoiding emotional entanglements with family, an Eternal may not have children.\"\\n\\n The Computer said gravely, \"I didn\u0027t ask about marriage or children.\"\\n\\n Harlan quoted further: \"Temporary liaisons may be made with Timers only after application with the Central Charting Board of the Allwhen Council for an appropriate Life-Plot of the Timer concerned. Liaisons may be conducted thereafter only according to the requirements of specific spatio-temporal charting.\"\\n\\n \"Quite true. Have you ever applied for temporary liaison, Technician?\"\\n\\n \"No, Computer.\"\\n\\n \"Do you intend to?\"\\n\\n \"No, Computer.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps you ought to. It would give you a greater breadth of view. You would become less concerned about the details of a woman\u0027s costume, less disturbed about her possible personal relations with other Eternals.\"\\n\\n Harlan left, speechless with rage.\\n\\n He found it almost impossible to perform his near-daily trek into the 482nd (the longest continuous period remaining something under two hours.)\\n\\n He was upset, and he knew why. Finge! Finge, and his coarse advice concerning liaisons with Timers.\\n\\n Liaisons existed. Everyone knew that. Eternity had always been aware of the necessity for compromising with human appetites (to Harlan the phrase carried a quivery repulsion), but the restrictions involved in choosing mistresses made the compromise anything but lax, anything but generous. And those who were lucky enough to qualify for such an arrangement were expected to be most discreet about it, out of common decency and consideration for the majority.\\n\\n Among the lower classes of Eternals, particularly among Maintenance, there were always the rumors (half hopeful, half resentful) of women imported on a more or less permanent basis for the obvious reasons. Always rumor pointed to the Computers and Life-Plotters as the benefiting groups. They and only they could decide which women could be abstracted from Time without danger of significant Reality Change.\\n\\n Less sensational (and therefore less tongue-worthy) were the stories concerning the Timer employees that every Section engaged temporarily (when spatio-temporal analysis permitted) to perform the tedious tasks of cooking, cleaning, and heavy labor.\\n\\n But a Timer, and such a Timer, employed as \"secretary,\" could only mean that Finge was thumbing a nose at the ideals that made Eternity what it was.\\n\\n Regardless of the facts of life to which the practical men of Eternity made a perfunctory obeisance it remained true that the ideal Eternal was a dedicated man living for the mission he had to perform, for the betterment of Reality and the improvement of the sum of human happiness. Harlan liked to think that Eternity was like the rnonasteries of Primitive times.\\n\\n He dreamed that night that he spoke to Twissell about the matter, and that Twissell, the ideal Eternal, shared his horror. He dreamed of a broken Finge, stripped of rank. He dreamed of himself with the yellow Computer\u0027s insigne, instituting a new regime in the 482nd, ordering Finge grandly to a new position in Maintenance. Twissell sat next to him, smiling with admiration, as he drew up a new organizational chart, neat, orderly, consistent, and asked Noys Lambent to distribute copies.\\n\\n But Noys Lambent was nude, and Harlan woke up, trembling and ashamed.\\n\\n He met the girl in a corridor one day and stood aside, eyes averted, to let her pass.\\n\\n But she remained standing, looking at him, until he had to look up and meet her eyes. She was all color and life and Harlan was conscious of a faint perfume about her.\\n\\n She said, \"You\u0027re Technician Harlan, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n His impulse was to snub her, to force his way past, but, after all, he told himself, all this wasn\u0027t her fault. Besides, to move past her now would mean touching her.\\n\\n So he nodded briefly. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m told you\u0027re quite an expert on our Time.\"\\n\\n \"I have been in it.\"\\n\\n \"I would love to talk to you about it someday.\"\\n\\n \"I am busy. I wouldn\u0027t have time.\"\\n\\n \"But Mr. Harlan, surely you could find time someday.\"\\n\\n She smiled at him.\\n\\n Harlan said in a desperate whisper, \"Will you pass, please? Or will you stand aside to let me pass? Please!\"\\n\\n She moved by with a slow swing of her hips that brought blood tingling to his embarrassed cheeks.\\n\\n He was angry at her for embarrassing him, angry at himself for being embarrassed, and angry, most of all, for some obscure reason, at Finge.\\n\\n Finge called him in at the end of two weeks. On his desk was a sheet of perforated flimsy the length and intricacy of which told Harlan at once that this concerned no half-hour excursion into Time.\\n\\n Finge said, \"Would you sit down, Harlan, and scan this thing right now? No, not by eye. Use the machine.\"\\n\\n Harlan lifted indifferent eyebrows, and inserted the sheet carefully between the lips of the scanner on Finge\u0027s desk. Slowly it passed into the intestines of the machine and, as it did so, the perforation pattern was translated into words that appeared on the cloudy-white rectangle that was the visual attachment.\\n\\n Somewhere about midpoint, Harlan\u0027s hand shot out and disconnected the scanner. He yanked the flimsy out with a force that tore its tough cellulite structure.\\n\\n Finge said calmly, \"I have another copy.\"\\n\\n But Harlan was holding the remnants between thumb and forefinger as though it might explode. \"Computer Finge, there is some mistake. Surely I am not to be expected to use the home of this woman as base for a near-week stay in Time.\"\\n\\n The Computer pursed his lips. \"Why not, if the spatio-temporal requirements are such. If there is a personal problem involved between yourself and Miss Lam--\"\\n\\n \"No personal problem at all,\" interposed Harlan hotly.\\n\\n \"Some kind of problem, certainly. In the circumstances, I will go as far as to explain certain aspects of the Observational problem. This is not to be taken as a precedent, of course.\"\\n\\n Harlan sat motionless. He was thinking hard and fast. Ordinarily professional pride would have forced Harlan to disdain explanation. An Observer, or Technician, for that matter, did his job without question. And ordinarily a Computer would never dream of offering explanation.\\n\\n Here, however, was something unusual. Harlan had complained concerning the girl, the so-called secretary. Finge was afraid the complaint might go further. (\"The guilty fleeth when no man pursueth,\" thought Harlan with grim satisfaction and tried to remember where he had read that phrase.)\\n\\n Finge\u0027s strategy was obvious, therefore. By stationing Harlan in the woman\u0027s dwelling place he would be ready to make counteraccusations if matters went far enough. Harlan\u0027s value as a witness against him would be destroyed.\\n\\n And, of course, he would have to have some specious explanation for placing Harlan in such a place, and this would be it. Harlan listened with barely hidden contempt.\\n\\n Finge said, \"As you know, the various Centuries are aware of the existence of Eternity. They know that we supervise intertemporal trade. They consider that to be our chief function, which is good. They have a dim knowledge that we are also here to prevent catastrophe from striking mankind. That is more a superstition than anything else, but it is more or less correct, and good, too. We supply the generations with a mass father image and a certain feeling of security. You see all that, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Harlan thought: Does the man think I\u0027m still a Cub?\\n\\n But he nodded briefly.\\n\\n Finge went on. \"There are some things, however, they must not know. Prime among them, of course, is the manner in which we alter Reality when necessary. The insecurity such knowledge would arouse would be most harmful. It is always necessary to breed out of Reality any factors that might lead to such knowledge and we have never been troubled with it.\\n\\n \"However, there are always other undesirable beliefs about Eternity which spring up from time to time in one Century or another. Usually, the dangerous beliefs are those which concentrate particularly in the ruling classes of an era; the classes that have most contact with us and, at the same time, carry the important weight of what is called public opinion.\"\\n\\n Finge paused as though he expected Harlan to offer some comment or ask some question. Harlan did neither.\\n\\n Finge continued. \"Ever since the Reality Change 433-486, Serial Number F-2, which took place about a year-a physioyear ago, there has been evidence of the bringing into Reality of such an undesirable belief. I have come to certain conclusions about the nature of that belief and have presented them to the Allwhen Council. The Council is reluctant to accept them since they depend upon the realization of an alternate in the Computing Pattern of an extremely low probability.\\n\\n \"Before acting on my recommendation, they insist on confirmation by direct Observation. It\u0027s a most delicate job, which is why I recalled you, and why Computer Twissell allowed you to be recalled. Another thing I did was to locate a member of the current aristocracy, who thought it would be thrilling or exciting to work in Eternity. I placed her in this office and kept her under close observation to see if she were suitable for our purpose--\"\\n\\n Harlan thought: Close observation! Yes!\\n\\n Again his anger focused itself on Finge rather than upon the woman.\\n\\n Finge was still speaking. \"By all standards, she is suitable. We will now return her to her Time. Using her dwelling as a base, you will be able to study the social life of her circle. Do you understand now the reason I had the girl here and the reason I want you in her house?\"\\n\\n Harlan said with an almost open irony, \"I understand quite well, I assure you.\"\\n\\n \"Then you will accept this mission.\"\\n\\n Harlan left with the fire of battle burning inside his chest. Finge was not going to outsmart him. He was not going to make a fool of him.\\n\\n Surely it was that fire of battle, the determination to outwit Finge, that caused him to experience an eagerness, almost an exhilaration, at the thought of this next excursion into the 482nd.\\n\\n Surely it was nothing else. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-eternity/page-4.html","bookId":1747,"book":{"id":1747,"title":"The End of Eternity","description":"Storyline: Andrew Harlan is an Eternal, a man whose job it is to range through past and present Centuries, monitoring and, where necessary, altering Time\u0027s myriad cause-and-effect relationships.
