{"id":70862,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Harlan had been in the 575th for weeks before he met Brinsley Sheridan Cooper. He had time to grow used to his new quarters and to the antisepsis of glass and porcelain. He learned to wear the Technician\u0027s mark with only moderate shrinking and to refrain from making things worse by standing so that the insigne was hidden against a wall or was covered by the interposition of some object he was carrying.\n Others smiled disdainfully when that was done and turned colder as though they suspected an attempt to invade their friendship on false pretenses.\n Senior Computer Twissell brought him problems daily. Harlan studied them and wrote his analyses in drafts that were four times rewritten, the last version being handed in reluctantly even so.\n Twissell would appraise them and nod and say, \"Good, good.\" Then his old blue eyes would dart quickly at Harlan and his smile would narrow a bit as he said, \"I\u0027ll test this guess on the Computaplex.\"\n He always called the analysis a \"guess.\" He never told Harlan the result of the Computaplex check, and Harlan dared not ask. He was despondent over the fact that he was never asked to put any of his own analyses into action. Did that mean that the Computaplex was not checking him, that he had been choosing the wrong item for the induction of a Reality Change, that he did not have the knack of seeing the Minimum Necessary Change in an indicated range? (It was not until later that he grew sufficiently sophisticated to have the phrase come rolling off his tongue as M.N.C.)\n One day Twissell came in with an abashed individual who seemed scarcely to dare raise his eyes to meet Harlan\u0027s.\n Twissell said, \"Technician Harlan, this is Cub B. S. Cooper.\"\n Automatically Harlan said, \"Hello,\" weighed the man\u0027s appearance, and was unimpressed. The fellow was on the shortish side, with dark hair parted in the middle. His chin was narrow, his eyes an indefinite light brown, his ears a little large, and his fingernails bitten.\n Twissell said, \"This is the boy to whom you will be teaching Primitive history.\"\n \"Great Time,\" said Harlan with suddenly increased interest. \"Hello!\" He had almost forgotten.\n Twissell said, \"Arrange a schedule with him that will suit you, Harlan. If you can manage two afternoons a week, I think that would be fine. Use your own method of teaching him. I\u0027ll leave that to you. If you should need book-films or old documents, tell me, and if they exist in Eternity or in any part of Time that can be reached, we\u0027ll get them. Eh, boy?\"\n He plucked a lit cigarette out of nowhere (as it always seemed) and the air reeked with smoke. Harlan coughed and from the twisting of the Cub\u0027s mouth it was quite obvious that the latter would have done the same had he dared.\n After Twissell left, Harlan said, \"Well, sit down\"-he hesitated a moment, then added determinedly-\"Son. Sit down, son. My office isn\u0027t much, but it\u0027s yours whenever we\u0027re together.\"\n Harlan was almost flooded with eagerness. This project was his! Primitive history was something that was all his own.\n The Cub raised his eyes (for the first time, really) and said stumblingly, \"You are a Technician.\"\n A considerable part of Harlan\u0027s excitement and warmth died. \"What of it?\"\n \"Nothing,\" said the Cub. \"I just--\"\n \"You heard Computer Twissell address me as Technician, didn\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n \"Did you think it was a slip of the tongue? Something too bad to be true?\"\n \"No, sir.\"\n \"What\u0027s wrong with your speech?\" Harlan asked brutally, and even as he did so, he felt shame nudge him.\n Cooper blushed painfully. \"I\u0027m not very good at Standard Intertemporal.\"\n \"Why not? How long have you been a Cub?\"\n \"Less than one year, sir.\"\n \"One year? How old are you, for Time\u0027s sake?\"\n \"Twenty-four physioyears, sir.\"\n Harlan stared. \"Are you trying to tell me that they took you into Eternity at twenty-three?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n Harlan sat down and rubbed his hands together. That just wasn\u0027t done. Fifteen to sixteen was the age of entrance into Eternity. What was this? A new kind of testing of himself on the part of Twissell?\n He said, \"Sit down and let\u0027s get started. Your name in full and your homewhen.\"\n The Cub stammered, \"Brinsley Sheridan Cooper of the 78th, sir.\"\n Harlan almost softened. That was close. It was only seventeen Centuries downwhen from his own homewhen. Almost a Temporal neighbor.\n He said, \"Are you interested in Primitive history?\"\n \"Computer Twissell asked me to learn. I don\u0027t know much about it.\"\n \"What else are you learning?\"\n \"Mathematics. Temporal engineering. I\u0027m just getting the fundamentals so far. Back in the 78th, I was a Speedy-vac repairman.\"\n There was no point in asking the nature of a Speedy-vac. It might be a suction cleaner, a computing machine, a type of spray painter. Anything. Harlan wasn\u0027t particularly interested.\n He said, \"Do you know anything about history? Any kind of history?\"\n \"I studied European history.\"\n \"Your particular political unit, I take it.\"\n \"I was born in Europe. Yes. Mostly, of course, they taught us modern history. After the revolutions of \u002754; 7554, that is.\"\n \"All right. First thing you do is to forget it. It doesn\u0027t mean anything. The history they try to teach Timers changes with every Reality Change. Not that they realize that. In each Reality, their history is the only history. That\u0027s what\u0027s so different about Primitive history. That\u0027s the beauty of it. No matter what any of us does, it exists precisely as it has always existed. Columbus and Washington, Mussolini and Hereford, they all exist.\"\n Cooper smiled feebly. He brushed his little finger across his upper lip and for the first time Harlan noticed a trace of bristle there as though the Cub were cultivating a mustache.\n Cooper said, \"I can\u0027t quite-get used to it, all the time I\u0027ve been here.\"\n \"Get used to what?\"\n \"Being five hundred Centuries away from homewhen.\"\n \"I\u0027m nearly that myself. I\u0027m 95th.\"\n \"That\u0027s another thing. You\u0027re older than I am and yet I\u0027m seventeen Centuries older than you in another way. I can be your great-great-great-and-so-on-grandfather.\"\n \"What\u0027s the difference? Suppose you are?\"\n \"Well, it takes getting used to.\" There was a trace of rebellion in the Cub\u0027s voice.\n \"It does for all of us,\" said Harlan callously, and began talking about the Primitives. By the time three hours had passed, he was deep in an explanation concerning the reasons why there were Centuries before the ist Century.\n (\"But isn\u0027t the 1st Century first?\" Cooper had asked plaintively.)\n Harlan ended by giving the Cub a book, not a good one, really, but one that would serve as a beginning. \"I\u0027ll get you better stuff as we go along,\" he said.\n By the end of a week Cooper\u0027s mustache had become a pronounced dark bristle that made him look ten years older and accentuated the narrowness of his chin. On the whole, Harlan decided, it would not be an improvement, that mustache.\n Cooper said, \"I\u0027ve finished your book.\"\n \"What did you think of it?\"\n \"In a way--\" There was a long pause. Cooper began over again. \"Parts of the later Primitive was something like the 78th. It made me think of home, you know. Twice, I dreamed about my wife.\"\n Harlan exploded. \"Your wife?\"\n \"I was married before I came here.\"\n \"Great Time! Did they bring your wife across too?\"\n Cooper shook his head. \"I don\u0027t even know if she\u0027s been Changed in the last year. If she has, I suppose she\u0027s not really my wife now.\"\n Harlan recovered. Of course, if the Cub were twenty-three years old when he was taken into Eternity, it was quite possible that he might have been married. One thing unprecedented led to another.\n What was going on? Once modifications were introduced into the rules, it wouldn\u0027t be a long step to the point where everything would decline into a mass of incoherency. Eternity was too finely balanced an arrangement to endure modification.\n It was his anger on behalf of Eternity, perhaps, that put an unintended harshness into Harlan\u0027s next words. \"I hope you\u0027re not planning on going back to the 78th to check on her.\"\n The Cub lifted his head and his eyes were firm and steady. \"No.\"\n Harlan shifted uneasily, \"Good. You have no family. Nothing. You\u0027re an Eternal and don\u0027t ever think of anyone you knew in Time.\"\n Cooper\u0027s lips thinned, and his accent stood out sharply in his quick words. \"You\u0027re speaking like a Technician.\"\n Harlan\u0027s fists clenched along the sides of his desk. He said hoarsely, \"What do you imply? I\u0027m a Technician so I make the Changes? So I defend them and demand that you accept them? Look, kid, you haven\u0027t been here a year; you can\u0027t speak Intertemporal; you\u0027re all misgeared on Time and Reality, but you think you know all about Technicians and how to kick them in the teeth.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Cooper quickly; \"I didn\u0027t mean to offend you.\"\n \"No, no, who offends a Technician? You just hear everyone else talking, is that it? They say, \u0027Cold as a Technician\u0027s heart,\u0027 don\u0027t they? They say, \u0027A trillion personalities changed-just a Technician\u0027s yawn.\u0027 Maybe a few other things. What\u0027s the answer, Mr. Cooper? Does it make you feel sophisticated to join in? It makes you a big man? A big wheel in Eternity?\"\n \"I said I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"All right. I just want you to know I\u0027ve been a Technician for less than a month and I personally have never induced a Reality Change. Now let\u0027s get on with business.\"\n Senior Computer Twissell called Andrew Harlan to his office the next day.\n He said, \"How would you like to go out on an M.N.C., boy?\"\n It was almost too apposite. All that morning Harlan had been regretting his cowardly disclaimer of personal involvement in the Technician\u0027s work; his childish cry of: I haven\u0027t done anything wrong yet, so don\u0027t blame me.\n It amounted to an admission that there was something wrong about a Technician\u0027s work, and that he himself was blameless only because he was too new at the game to have had time to be a criminal.\n He welcomed the chance to kill that excuse now. It would be almost a penance. He could say to Cooper: Yes, because of something I have done, this many millions of people are new personalities, but it was necessary and I am proud to have been the cause.\n So Harlan said joyfully, \"I\u0027m ready, sir.\"\n \"Good. Good. You\u0027ll be glad to know, boy,\" (a puff, and the cigarette tip glowed brilliantly) \"that every one of your analyses checked out with high-order accuracy.\"\n \"Thank you, sir.\" (They were analyses now, thought Harlan, not guesses.)\n \"You\u0027ve got a talent. Quite a touch, boy. I look for great things. And we can begin with this one, 223rd. Your statement that a jammed vehicle clutch would supply the necessary fork without undesirable side effects is perfectly correct. Will you jam it?\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n That was Harlan\u0027s true initiation into Technicianhood. After that he was more than just a man with a rose-red badge. He had handled Reality. He had tampered with a mechanism during a quick few minutes taken out of the 223rd and, as a result, a young man did not reach a lecture on mechanics he had meant to attend. He never went in for solar engineering, consequently, and a perfectly simple device was delayed in its development a crucial ten years. A war in the 224th, amazingly enough, was moved out of Reality as a result.\n Wasn\u0027t that good? What if personalities were changed? The new personalities were as human as the old and as deserving of life. If some lives were shortened, more were lengthened and made happier. A great work of literature, a monument of Man\u0027s intellect and feeling, was never written in the new Reality, but several copies were preserved in Eternity\u0027s libraries, were they not? And new creative works had come into existence, had they not?\n Yet that night Harlan spent hours in a hot agony of wakefulness, and when he finally drowsed groggily, he did something he hadn\u0027t done in years.\n He dreamed of his mother.\n Despite the weakness of such a beginning a physioyear was sufficient to make Harlan known throughout Eternity as \"Twissell\u0027s Technician,\" and, with more than a trace of ill-humor as \"The Wonder Boy\" and \"The Never-Wrong.\"\n His contact with Cooper became almost comfortable. They never grew completely friendly. (If Cooper could have brought himself to make advances, Harlan might not have known how to respond.) Nevertheless they worked well together, and Cooper\u0027s interest in Primitive history grew to the point where it nearly rivaled Harlan\u0027s.\n One day Harlan said to Cooper, \"Look, Cooper, would you mind coming in tomorrow instead? I\u0027ve got to get up to the 3000\u0027s sometime this week to check on an Observation and the man I want to see is free this afternoon.\"\n Cooper\u0027s eyes lit up hungrily, \"Why can\u0027t I come?\"\n \"Do you want to?\"\n \"Sure. I\u0027ve never been in a kettle except when they brought me here from the 78th and I didn\u0027t know what was happening at the time.\"\n Harlan was accustomed to using the kettle in Shaft C, which was, by unwritten custom, reserved for Technicians along its entire immeasurable length through the Centuries. Cooper showed no embarrassment at being led there. He stepped into the kettle without hesitation and took his seat on the curved molding that completely circled it.\n When Harlan, however, had activated the Field, and kicked the kettle into upwhen motion, Cooper\u0027s face screwed up into an almost comic expression of surprise.\n \"I don\u0027t feel a thing,\" he said. \"Is anything wrong?\"\n \"Nothing\u0027s wrong. You\u0027re not feeling anything because you\u0027re not really moving. You\u0027re being kicked along the temporal extension of the kettle. In fact,\" Harlan said, growing didactic, \"at the moment, you and I aren\u0027t matter, really, in spite of appearances. A hundred men could be using this same kettle, moving (if you can call it that) at various velocities in either Time-direction, passing through one another and so on. The laws of the ordinary universe just don\u0027t apply to the kettle shafts!\"\n Cooper\u0027s mouth quirked a bit and Harlan thought uneasily: The kid\u0027s taking temporal engineering and knows more about this than I do. Why don\u0027t I shut up and stop making a fool of myself?\n He retreated into silence, and stared somberly at Cooper. The younger man\u0027s mustache had been full-grown for months. It drooped, framing his mouth in what Eternals called a Mallansohn hairline, because the only photograph known to be authentic of the Temporal Field inventor (and that a poor one and out of focus) showed him with just such a mustache. For that reason it maintained a certain popularity among Eternals even though it did few of them justice.\n Cooper\u0027s eyes were fixed on the shifting numbers that marked the passing of the Centuries with respect to themselves. He said, \"How far upwhen does the kettle shaft go?\"\n \"Haven\u0027t they taught you that?\"\n \"They\u0027ve hardly mentioned the kettles.\"\n Harlan shrugged. \"There\u0027s no end to Eternity. The shaft goes on forever.\"\n \"How far upwhen have you gone?\"\n \"This will be the uppest. Dr. Twissell has been up to the 50,000\u0027s.\"\n \"Great Time!\" whispered Cooper.\n \"That\u0027s still nothing. Some Eternals have been up past the 150,000th Century.\"\n \"What\u0027s that like?\"\n \"Like nothing at all,\" said Harlan morosely. \"Lots of life but none of it human. Man is gone.\"\n \"Dead? Wiped out?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know that anyone exactly knows.\"\n \"Can\u0027t something be done to change that?\"\n \"Well, from the 70,000\u0027s on--\" began Harlan, then ended abruptly. \"Oh, to Time with it. Change the subject.\"\n If there was one subject about which Eternals were almost superstitious, it was the \"Hidden Centuries,\" the time between the 70,000th and the 150,000th. It was a subject that was rarely mentioned. It was only Harlan\u0027s close association with Twissell that accounted for his own small knowledge of the era. What it amounted to was that Eternals couldn\u0027t pass into Time in all those thousands of Centuries. The doors between Eternity and Time were impenetrable. Why? No one knew.\n Harlan imagined, from some casual remarks of Twissell\u0027s, that attempts had been made to Change the Reality in the Centuries just downwhen from the 70,000th, but without adequate Observation beyond the 70,000th not much could be done.\n Twissell had laughed a bit one time and said, \"We\u0027ll get through someday. Meanwhile, 70,000 Centuries is quite enough to take care of.\"\n It did not sound wholly convincing.\n \"What happens to Eternity after the 150,000th?\" asked Cooper.\n Harlan sighed. The subject, apparently, was not to be changed. \"Nothing,\" he said. \"The Sections are there but there are no Eternals in it anywhere after the 70,000th. The Sections keep on going for millions of Centuries till all life is gone and past that, too, till the sun becomes a nova, and past that, too. There isn\u0027t any end to Eternity. That\u0027s why it\u0027s called Eternity.\"\n \"The sun does become a nova, then?\"\n \"It certainly does. Eternity couldn\u0027t exist if that weren\u0027t so. Nova Sol is our power supply. Listen, do you know how much power is required to set up a Temporal Field? Mallansohn\u0027s first Field was two seconds from extreme downwhen to extreme upwhen and big enough to hold not more than a match head and that took a nuclear power plant\u0027s complete output for one day. It took nearly a hundred years to set up a hair-thin Temporal Field far enough upwhen to be able to tap the radiant power of the nova so that a Field could be built big enough to hold a man.\"\n Cooper sighed. \"I wish they would get to the point where they stopped making me learn equations and field mechanics and start telling me some of the interesting stuff. Now if I had lived in Mallansohn\u0027s time--\"\n \"You would have learned nothing. He lived in the 24th, but Eternity didn\u0027t start till late in the 27th. Inventing the Field isn\u0027t the same as constructing Eternity, you know, and the rest of the 24th didn\u0027t have the slightest inkling of what Mallansohn\u0027s invention signified.\"\n \"He was ahead of his generation, then?\"\n \"Very much so. He not only invented the Temporal Field, but he described the basic relationships that made Eternity possible and predicted almost every aspect of it except for the Reality Change. Quite closely, too-but I think we\u0027re pulling to a halt, Cooper. After you.\"\n They stepped out.\n Harlan had never seen Senior Computer Laban Twissell angry before. People always said that he was incapable of any emotion, that he was an unsouled fixture of Eternity to the point where he had forgotten the exact number of his homewhen Century. People said that at an early age his heart had atrophied and that a hand computer similar to the model he carried always in his trouser pocket had taken its place.\n Twissell did nothing to deny these rumors. In fact most people guessed that he believed them himself.\n So even while Harlan bent before the force of the angry blast that struck him, he had room in his mind to be amazed at the fact that Twissell could display anger. He wondered if Twissell would be mortified in some calmer aftermath to realize that his hand-computer heart had betrayed him by exposing itself as only a poor thing of muscle and valves subject to the twists of emotion.\n Twissell said, in part, his old voice creaking, \"Father Time, boy, are you on the Allwhen Council? Do you give the orders around here? Do you tell me what to do or do I tell you what to do? Are you making arrangements for all kettle trips this Section? Do we all come to you for permission now?\"\n He interrupted himself with occasional exclamations of \"Answer me,\" then continued pouring more questions into the boiling interrogative caldron.\n He said finally, \"If you ever get above yourself this way again, I\u0027ll have you on plumbing repair and for good. Do you understand me?\"\n Harlan, pale with his own gathering embarrassment, said, \"I was never told that Cub Cooper was not to be taken on the kettle.\"\n The explanation did not act as an emollient. \"What kind of an excuse is a double negative, boy? You were never told not to get him drunk. You were never told not to shave him bald. You were never told not to skewer him with a fine-edged Tav curve. Father Time, boy, what were you told to do with him?\"\n \"I was told to teach him Primitive history.\"\n \"Then do so. Do nothing more than that.\" Twissell dropped his cigarette and ground it savagely underfoot as though it were the face of a lifelong enemy.\n \"I\u0027d like to point out, Computer,\" said Harlan, \"that many Centuries under the current Reality somewhat resemble specific eras of Primitive history in one or more respects. It had been my intention to take him out to those Times, under careful spatio-temporal charting, of course, as a form of field trip.\"\n \"What? Listen, you chucklehead, don\u0027t you ever intend to ask my permission for anything? That\u0027s out. Just teach him Primitive history. No field trips. No laboratory experiments, either. Next you\u0027ll be changing Reality just to show him how.\"\n Harlan licked his dry lips with a dry tongue, muttered a resentful acquiescence, and, eventually, was allowed to leave.\n It took weeks for his hurt feelings to heal over somewhat. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-eternity/page-3.html","bookId":1747,"book":{"id":1747,"title":"The End of Eternity","description":"Storyline: \n Andrew Harlan is an Eternal, a man whose job it is to range through past and present Centuries, monitoring and, where necessary, altering Time\u0027s myriad cause-and-effect relationships.
