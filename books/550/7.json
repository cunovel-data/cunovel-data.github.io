{"id":38855,"no":7,"title":"VI. THE HUNT ENDS.","content":"It will be seen that Mr. Jim Simmons, in his crude way, was a very shrewd reasoner. He didn\u0027t \"guess;\" he \"reckoned,\" and it cannot be denied that he came very near the truth. You will remember that when we children play hide-the-switch the one that hides it guides those who are hunting for it by making certain remarks. When they are near where the switch is hid, the hider says, \"You burn; you are afire,\" but when they get further away from the hiding-place the word is, \"You are cold; you are freezing.\" In hunting for Aaron, Mr. Jim Simmons was burning, for he had come very close to solving the problem that the fugitive had set for him. Mr. Simmons was so sure he was right in his reasoning that he cheered his dogs on lustily and touched up his horse. George Gossett did the same, and dogs, horses, and men went careering[112] along the plantation road to the river landing. The sun was now above the treetops, and the chill air of the morning was beginning to surrender to its influence. The course of the river was marked out in mid-air by a thin line of white mist that hung wavering above the stream. The dogs ran crying to the landing, and there they stopped. One of the younger hounds was for wading across; but Sound, the leader, knew better than that. He ran down the river bank a hundred yards and then circled back across the field until he reached a point some distance above the landing. Then he returned, his keen nose always to the ground. At the landing he looked across the river and whined eagerly. Mr. Simmons seemed to be very lucky that morning, for just as he and George Gossett galloped to the landing a boatload of field hands started across from the other side, old Uncle Andy coming with it to row it back. On the other side, too, Mr. Simmons saw a lady standing,—a trim figure dressed in black,—and near her a negro boy was holding a horse that she had evidently ridden to the landing. This was the lady to whom Uncle Andy sometimes referred as[113] Sally Ward, and for whom he had a sincere affection. The river was not wide at the landing, and the boatload of field hands, propelled by four muscular arms, was not long in crossing. As the negroes jumped ashore Sound went among them and examined each one with his nose, but he returned to the landing and looked across and whined. They saluted Mr. Simmons and George Gossett politely, and then went on their way, whistling, singing, and cracking jokes, and laughing loudly. \"Was a bateau missing from this side this morning?\" Mr. Simmons asked Uncle Andy. \"Suh?\" Uncle Andy put his hand to his ear, affecting to be very anxious to hear what Mr. Simmons had said. The question was repeated, whereat Uncle Andy laughed loudly. \"You sho is a witch fer guessin\u0027, suh! How come you ter know \u0027bout de missin\u0027 boat?\" Mr. Simmons smiled under this flattery. \"I thought maybe a boat would be missing from this side this morning,\" he said. \"Dey sho wuz, suh; but I dunner how de name er goodness you come ter know \u0027bout it,[114] kaze I wuz on de bank cross dar \u0027fo\u0027 \u0027t wuz light, en I ain\u0027t see you on dis side. Yes, suh! De boat wuz gone. Dey foun\u0027 it \u0027bout a mile down de river, en on account er de shoals down dar, dey had ter take it out\u0027n de water en fetch it back yer in de waggin. Yes, suh! dish yer de very boat.\" \"Where\u0027s the ford?\" Mr. Simmons inquired. \"I used to know, but I\u0027ve forgotten.\" \"Right below yer, suh!\" replied Uncle Andy. \"You\u0027ll see de paff whar de stock cross at. B\u0027ar down stream, suh, twel you halfway cross, den b\u0027ar up. Ef you do dat you won\u0027t git yo\u0027 stirrup wet.\" The ford was easily found, but the crossing was not at all comfortable. In fact, Uncle Andy had maliciously given Mr. Simmons the wrong directions. The two men rode into the water, bore down the stream, and their horses were soon floundering in deep water. They soon touched bottom again, and in a few moments they were safe on the opposite bank,—safe, but dripping wet and in no very good humor. Mr. Simmons\u0027s dogs, obedient to his call, followed his horse into the water and swam across. [115] Sound clambered out, shook himself, and ran back to the landing where the lady was waiting for the boat to return. It had been Mr. Simmons\u0027s intention to proceed at once down the river to the point where the boat had been found, and where he was sure the dogs would pick up the scent of the runaway; but he found that the way was impossible for horses. He must needs go to the landing and inquire the way. Uncle Andy had just made the middle seat in the bateau more comfortable for his mistress by placing his coat, neatly folded, on the hard plank, and Mrs. Ward was preparing to accept the old negro\u0027s invitation to \"git aboard, mistiss,\" when Mr. Simmons and George Gossett rode up. Both raised their hats as the lady glanced toward them. They were hardly in a condition to present themselves, Mr. Simmons explained, and then he inquired, with as much politeness as he could command, how to reach the place where the missing boat had been found. \"The missing boat? Why, I never heard of it till now. Was one of the bateaux missing this morning?\" the lady asked Uncle Andy. \"Yessum. When de fishin\u0027 good en de niggers[116] put out der set-hooks, dey ain\u0027t many mornin\u0027s in de week dat one er de yuther er deze boats ain\u0027t missin\u0027!\" \"I never heard of it before.\" \"No, mistiss; de boys \u0027low you wouldn\u0027t keer nohow. Dey runs um over de shoals, en dar dey leaves um.\" \"But both bateaux are here.\" \"Yessum. We fetches um back \u0027roun\u0027 by de road in de waggin.\" \"Who carried the bateau over the shoals this morning?\" \"Me, ma\u0027am. Nobody ain\u0027t know nuttin\u0027 \u0027bout it but de two Elliks, en when dat ar gemmun dar ax me des now if dey wa\u0027n\u0027t a boat missin\u0027 fum \u0027roun\u0027 yer dis mornin\u0027 hit sorter flung me back on myse\u0027f. I \u0027low \u0027Yes, suh,\u0027 but he sho flung me back on myse\u0027f.\" Uncle Andy began to chuckle so heartily that his mistress asked him what he was laughing at, though she well knew. \"I hit myse\u0027f on de funny bone, mistiss, en when dat\u0027s de case I bleege ter laugh.\" At this the lady laughed, and it was a genial, merry, and musical laugh. Mr. Simmons smiled,[117] but so grimly that it had the appearance of a threat. \"And so this is Mr. Simmons, the famous negro hunter?\" said Mrs. Ward. \"Well, Mr. Simmons, I\u0027m glad to see you. I\u0027ve long had something to say to you. Whenever you are sent for to catch one of my negroes I want you to come straight to the house on the hill yonder and set your dogs on me. When one of my negroes goes to the woods, you may know it\u0027s my fault.\" \"Trufe, too!\" remarked Uncle Andy, under his breath, but loud enough for all to hear. \"That may be so, ma\u0027am,\" replied Mr. Simmons; \"but among a passel of niggers you\u0027ll find some bad ones. What little pleasure I get out of this business is in seeing and hearing my dogs run. Somebody\u0027s got to catch the runaways, and it might as well be me as anybody.\" \"Why, certainly, Mr. Simmons. You have become celebrated. Your name is trumpeted about in all the counties round. You are better known than a great many of our rising young politicians.\" The lady\u0027s manner was very gracious, but there was a gleam of humor in her eye. Mr. Simmons[118] didn\u0027t know whether she was laughing at him or paying him a compliment; but he thought it would be safe to change the subject. \"May I ask the old man there a few questions?\" he inquired. \"Why, certainly,\" Mrs. Ward responded. \"Cross-examine him to your heart\u0027s content. But be careful about it, Mr. Simmons. He\u0027s old and feeble, and his mind is not as good as it used to be. I heard him telling the house girl last night that he was losing his senses.\" \"De lawsy massy, mistiss! You know I wuz des projickin\u0027 wid dat gal. Dey ain\u0027t any na\u0027er nigger in de country got any mo\u0027 sense dan what I got. You know dat yo\u0027se\u0027f.\" \"Was anybody with you in the bateau when you went down the river this morning?\" \"Yes, suh, dey wuz,\" replied Uncle Andy solemnly. \"Who was it?\" \"Well, suh\"— \"Don\u0027t get excited, now, Andrew,\" his mistress interrupted. \"Tell Mr. Simmons the truth. You know your weakness.\" If Uncle Andy\u0027s skin had been white or even[119] brown, Mr. Simmons would have seen him blushing violently. He knew his mistress was making fun of him, but he was not less embarrassed on that account. He looked at Mrs. Ward and laughed. \"Speak right out,\" said the lady. \"Who was with you in the bateau?\" \"Little Essek, ma\u0027m,—my gran-chil\u0027. I\u0027m bleedge ter have some un long fer ter hol\u0027 de boat steady when I go ter look at my set-hooks. Little Essek wuz de fust one I see, en I holler\u0027d at \u0027im.\" \"Did anybody cross from the other side this morning?\" asked Mr. Simmons. \"Not dat I knows un, less\u0027n it wuz Criddle\u0027s Jerry. He\u0027s got a wife at de Abercrombie place. He fotch Marse Criddle\u0027s buggy to be worked on at our blacksmif shop, en he rid de mule home dis mornin\u0027. Little Essek had \u0027er down yer \u0027bout daylight waitin\u0027 fer Jerry, kaze he say he got ter be home soon ef not befo\u0027.\" Uncle Andy had an imagination. Jerry had brought the buggy and had ridden the mule home. He also had a wife at the Abercrombie place, but his master had given him no \"pass\" to visit her, thinking it might delay his return. For that[120] reason Jerry did not cross the river the night before. \"And here we\u0027ve been chasing Criddle\u0027s Jerry all the morning,\" remarked George Gossett to Mr. Simmons. \"Pap was right.\" \"But what was the nigger doing at your place?\" Mr. Simmons was still arguing the matter in his mind. \"Don\u0027t ask me,\" replied George Gossett. \"Dey ain\u0027t no \u0027countin\u0027 fer a nigger, suh,\" remarked Uncle Andy affably. \"Dey ain\u0027t no \u0027countin\u0027 fer \u0027em when dey ol\u0027 ez I is, much less when dey young en soople like Criddle\u0027s Jerry.\" Under the circumstances there was nothing for Mr. Simmons and young Gossett to do but to turn short about and recross the river. It was fortunate for them that a negro boy was waiting to take Mrs. Ward\u0027s horse across the river. They followed him into the ford, and made the crossing without difficulty. Then the two men held a council of war. Uncle Andy had another name for it. \"I wish you\u0027d look at um jugglin\u0027,\" he said to his mistress, as he helped her from the bateau. George Gossett was wet, tired, and disgusted,[121] and he would not hear to Mr. Simmons\u0027s proposition to \"beat about the bushes\" in the hope that the dogs would strike Aaron\u0027s trail. \"We started wrong,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s go home, and when we try for the nigger again, let\u0027s start right.\" \"Well, tell your father I\u0027ll be back the day after to-morrow if I don\u0027t catch his nigger. I\u0027m obliged to go home now and change my duds if I don\u0027t strike a trail. It\u0027s a true saying that there\u0027s more mud than water in the Oconee. I\u0027ll take a short cut. I\u0027ll go up the river a mile or such a matter and ride across to Dawson\u0027s old mill road. That will take me home by dinner time.\" As it happened, Mr. Simmons didn\u0027t take dinner at home that day, nor did he return to Gossett\u0027s at the time he appointed. He called his dogs and turned his horse\u0027s head up stream. He followed the course of the river for a mile or more, and then bore away from it. While he was riding along, lost in his reflections, he suddenly heard Sound giving tongue far ahead. That sagacious dog had unexpectedly hit on Aaron\u0027s trail, and he lost no time in announcing the fact as loudly as he could. Mr. Simmons was very much surprised. [122] \"If that blamed dog is fooling me this time I\u0027ll feel like killing him,\" he remarked to himself. The rest of the dogs joined in, and they were all soon footing it merrily in the direction of the big swamp. The blue falcon, circling high in the air, suddenly closed her wings and dropped into the leafy bosom of the Swamp. This was the first messenger. That red joker, the Fox Squirrel, had heard the wailing cry of the hounds, and scampered down the big pine. Halfway down he made a flying leap into the live oak, and then from tree to tree he went running, scrambling, jumping. But let him go never so fast, the blue falcon was before him, and let the blue falcon swoop never so swiftly, the message was before her. For the White Grunter had ears. Ooft! he had heard the same wailing sound when the hounds were after him before he was old enough to know what his tusks were for. And Rambler had ears. In fact, the Swamp itself had ears, and for a few moments it held its breath (as the saying is) and listened. Listened intently,—and then quietly, cautiously, and serenely began to dispose of its forces. Near the big poplar Aaron had a pile of[123] stones. They had been selected to fit his hand; they were not too large nor too small; they were not too light nor too heavy. This pile of stones was Aaron\u0027s ammunition, and he took his stand by it. The White Pig rose slowly from his bed of mud, where he had been wallowing, and shook himself. Then he scratched himself by rubbing his side against a beech-tree. The Brindle Steer slowly dragged himself through the canes and tall grass, and came to Aaron\u0027s tree, where he paused with such a loud sigh that Rambler jumped away. \"It is the track dogs,\" he said. \"Yes; I\u0027m sorry,\" replied Aaron. \"When the big black dog comes stand aside and leave him to me.\" \"Gooft! not if it\u0027s the one that chewed my ear,\" remarked the White Pig. \"I came this morning by the thunder-wood tree,\" said Aaron. \"Hide in the grass near there, and when they pass come charging after them.\" The dogs came nearer and nearer, and the Swamp could hear Mr. Simmons cheering them on. As for Mr. Simmons, he was sure of one thing—the[124] dogs were trailing either a wildcat or a runaway. He had never trained them not to follow the scent of a wildcat, and he now regretted it; for his keen ear, alive to differences that would not attract the attention of those who had never made a study of the temperament of dogs, detected a more savage note in their cry than he was accustomed to hear. Nor did his ear deceive him. Sound was following the scent of Aaron, but his companions were trailing Rambler, who had accompanied Aaron, and this fact gave a fiercer twang to their cry. When Aaron was going from Gossett\u0027s to the river landing, Rambler was not trotting at his heels, but scenting ahead, sometimes far to the right and at other times far to the left. But in going from the river to the Swamp it was otherwise. Rambler had to hold his head high to prevent Aaron\u0027s heel from striking him on the under jaw. His scent lay with that of the Son of Ben Ali. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2801/77473.html","bookId":550,"book":{"id":550,"title":"Aaron in the Wildwoods","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a large plantation in Middle Georgia a boy who was known as Little Crotchet.
