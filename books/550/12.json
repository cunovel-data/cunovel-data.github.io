{"id":38860,"no":12,"title":"XI. THE PROBLEM THAT TIMOLEON PRESENTED.","content":"When Mr. Abercrombie heard of the capers of the Black Stallion, he determined to place the horse in quarters that were more secure. But where? There was but one building on the place that could be regarded as perfectly secure—the crib in the five-acre lot. This crib was built of logs hewn square and mortised together at the ends. It had been built to hold corn and other grain, and logs were used instead of planks because the nearest sawmill was some distance away, and the logs were cheaper and handier. Moreover, as they were hewn from the hearts of the pines they would last longer than sawn lumber. This building was therefore selected as the Black Stallion\u0027s stable, and it was made ready. A trough was fitted up and the edges trimmed with hoop iron to prevent the horse from gnawing it to pieces. The floor was taken away and a new door[203] made, a thick, heavy affair. To guard against all accidents a hole, which could be opened or closed from the outside, was cut through the logs over the trough, so that when the Black Stallion was in one of his tantrums he could be fed and watered without risk to life or limb. When everything was ready, the question arose, how was the horse to be removed to his new quarters? Mr. Abercrombie considered the matter an entire afternoon, and then decided to postpone it until the next day. He said something about it at supper, and this caused Mrs. Abercrombie to remark that she hoped he would get rid of such a savage creature. She said she should never feel safe while the horse remained on the place. But Mr. Abercrombie laughed at this excess of fear, and so did Little Crotchet, who made bold to say that if his father would permit him, he would have Timoleon put in his stable that very night, and it would be done so quietly that nobody on the place would know how or when it happened. Mr. Abercrombie regarded his son with tender and smiling eyes. \"And what wonderful person will do this for you, my boy?\" [204] \"A friend of mine,\" replied Little Crotchet seriously. \"Well, you have so many friends that I\u0027ll never guess the name,\" remarked his father. \"Oh, but this is one of the most particular, particularest of my friends,\" the lad explained. \"I suppose you know he is getting up a great reputation among the servants,\" said Mrs. Abercrombie to her husband, half in jest and half in earnest. \"I know they are all very fond of him, my dear.\" \"Of course they are—how can they help themselves?\" the lad\u0027s mother cried. \"But this is \u0027a most particular, particularest\u0027 reputation.\" She quizzically quoted Little Crotchet\u0027s phrase, and he laughed when he heard it fall from her lips. \"It is something quite wonderful. Since the time that he issued orders for no one to bother him after nine o\u0027clock at night, the servants say that he talks with \u0027ha\u0027nts.\u0027 They say he has become so familiar with bogies and such things that he can be heard talking with them at all hours of the night.\" \"Your mother has been counting the candles[205] on you, my boy\" remarked Mr. Abercrombie jokingly. \"Why, father! how can you put such an idea in the child\u0027s mind?\" protested Mrs. Abercrombie. \"He\u0027s only teasing you, mama,\" said Little Crotchet. \"I heard him talking to a bogie the other night,\" remarked Mr. Hudspeth, the Teacher. \"Oh, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re a bogie,\" cried Little Crotchet. \"You would have been one, though, if you had kept me in those awful books.\" The Teacher had mischievously thrown out this hint about Aaron to see what effect it would have. He was amazed at the lad\u0027s self-possession, and at the deft manner in which he had turned the hint aside. \"Oh, have you been admitted to the sanctum?\" inquired the lad\u0027s mother, laughing. \"I paused at the door to say good-night and remained until I learned a lesson I never shall forget,\" said Mr. Hudspeth. \"Ah, you\u0027re finding our boy out, eh?\" exclaimed Mr. Abercrombie with a show of pride. \"He possesses already the highest culture the mind of man is capable of,\" Mr. Hudspeth declared.[206] His tone was so solemn and his manner so earnest that Little Crotchet blushed. \"He is cultured in the humanities. That is apart from scholarship,\" the Teacher explained, \"but without it all knowledge is cold and dark and unfruitful.\" \"I know he is very humane,\" suggested Mr. Abercrombie. \"Oh, it is more than that,\" said Mr. Hudspeth; \"far more than that. All sensitive people are tender-hearted. One may read a book and yet not catch the message it conveys. But this lad\"—He paused and suddenly changed the subject. \"He said he could have Timoleon carried to the new stable, and you are inclined to be doubtful. But he can do more than that: he can have the horse removed without bridle or halter.\" \"Then you know our boy better than we do!\" Mrs. Abercrombie\u0027s tone was almost reproachful. \"I found him out quite by accident,\" replied Mr. Hudspeth. Little Crotchet in his quaint way called attention to the fact that he was blushing again. \"You\u0027ve made me blush twice,\" he said, \"and I can\u0027t stay after that.\" At a sign, Jemimy, the house girl, who was[207] waiting on the table—the same Jemimy who afterward had a daughter named Drusilla—turned the lad\u0027s chair about. He balanced himself on his crutches, and without touching his feet to the floor walked across the room to the hall, and so up the stairway. On the landing he paused. \"Shall I have Timoleon put in the new stable to-night?\" he asked. \"By all means, my boy—if you can,\" answered Mr. Abercrombie. \"If you succeed I\u0027ll give you a handsome present.\" Little Crotchet always paused on the stair landing to say something, but never to say good-night. After a while his mother would go up and sit with him a few minutes, by way of kissing him good-night, and, later, his father would make the same little journey for the same purpose. On this particular night, those whom Little Crotchet had left at the table remained conversing longer than usual. Mr. Hudspeth had something more to say about humanity-culture; and although he employed \"the Concord dialect,\" as Mr. Abercrombie called it, his discourse was both interesting and stimulating. In the midst of it Jemimy[208] dropped a plate and broke it. The crash of the piece of china put a temporary end to the conversation, and the silence that ensued had its humorous side. Jemimy\u0027s eyes, big as saucers and as white, were turned toward a door that led to the sitting-room. The door softly opened, and a portly negro woman, with a bunch of keys hanging at her waist, came into the dining-room. This was Mammy Lucy, the housekeeper. She never once glanced toward her master and mistress. \"White er blue?\" she inquired in a low voice. \"Blue,\" replied Jemimy. \"Dat counts fer two,\" Mammy Lucy remarked. \"You\u0027ve done broke five. One mo\u0027, en you\u0027ll go whar you b\u0027long. I done say mo\u0027 dan once you ain\u0027t got no business in dis house. De fiel\u0027 \u0027s whar you b\u0027long at.\" Jemimy couldn\u0027t help that. She couldn\u0027t help anything. She knew how the Little Master would have the Black Stallion moved from one stable to the other. She knew, and she never would tell. They might send her to the field, they might drown her or strangle her, they might cut off her ears or gouge her eyes out, they might[209] send her to town to the calaboose, they might do anything they pleased, but she never would tell. Not while her name was Jemimy, and she\u0027d be named that until after she was put under the ground and covered up; and even then she wouldn\u0027t tell. Later when Mr. Abercrombie went upstairs to say good-night to Little Crotchet, the lad asked if he might have Timoleon trained. He had heard his father talking of getting a trainer from Mobile, and so he made the suggestion that, instead of going to that expense, it might be well to have the horse trained by his \"friend,\" as he called Aaron. Mr. Abercrombie guessed who Little Crotchet\u0027s friend was, but, to please the lad, feigned ignorance. He told his son that the training of such a horse as Timoleon was a very delicate piece of business, and should be undertaken by no one but an expert. Now, if Little Crotchet\u0027s \"friend\" was an expert, which was not likely, well and good; if not, he might ruin a good horse. Still, if Little Crotchet was sure that everything would be all right, why, there would be no objection. At any rate, the horse was now old enough to[210] be broken to the saddle, and Little Crotchet\u0027s \"friend\" could do that if no more. So it was settled, and the lad was very happy. He made his signal for Aaron early and often, but, somehow, the Son of Ben Ali was long in coming that night. The reason was plain enough when he did come, but Little Crotchet was very impatient. The moon was shining, and as George Gossett and his companions had refused to raise the siege a single night since Mr. Fullalove had seen the runaway at the stillhouse, Aaron found it difficult to respond promptly when the Little Master signaled him to come. It is not an easy matter to pass a picket line of patrollers when the moon is shining as it shines in Georgia at the beginning of autumn, and as it shone on the Abercrombie place the night that Little Crotchet was so anxious to see Aaron. Rambler was very busy that night trying to find a place where Aaron might pass the patrollers without attracting attention, but he had to give it up for a time. At last, however, three of them, George Gossett among the number, concluded to pay another visit to Mr. Fullalove, and this left the way clear. Aaron was prompt to[211] take advantage of it. Going half bent, he kept in the shadow of the fence, slipped through the small jungle of black-jacks, ran swiftly across an open space to the negro cabins, flitted to the garden fence, and in the shadow of that fled to the front yard, and so up the friendly oak. Oh, but Little Crotchet was impatient! He was almost ready to frown when Aaron made his appearance; but when the runaway told him of the big moon and the patrollers, he grew uneasy; and after telling Aaron about the Black Stallion, how the horse must be removed to the new stable, and how he must be broken to saddle and bridle, Little Crotchet declared that he was sorry he had signaled to Aaron. \"They\u0027ll catch you to-night, sure,\" he said. But Aaron shook his head. \"No, Little Master, not to-night. Not while I\u0027m with the grandson of Abdallah.\" \"Oh, I see!\" laughed Little Crotchet; \"you\u0027ll stay in his stable. Good! I\u0027ll bring you your breakfast in the morning.\" Aaron smiled, shaking his head and looking at the basket of victuals that Little Crotchet always had ready for him when he came. [212] \"No, Little Master! This will do. I\u0027ll not take the basket to-night. I\u0027ll put the victuals in my wallet.\" This was a bag suspended from his shoulder by a strap, being made after the manner of the satchels in which the children used to carry their books to school. Aaron had another idea in his head, but he gave no hint of it to little Crotchet, for he didn\u0027t know how it would succeed. So he sat by the lad\u0027s bedside and drove away the red goblin, Pain, and waited until George Gossett and his companions had time to make another visit to the stillhouse. Then he took the big key of the new stable from the mantel, slipped it on his belt,—a leathern thong that he always wore around his body,—placed in his wallet the substantial lunch that the Little Master had saved for him, and prepared to take his leave. This time he did not snuff out the light, but placed the candlestick on the hearth. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2801/77478.html","bookId":550,"book":{"id":550,"title":"Aaron in the Wildwoods","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a large plantation in Middle Georgia a boy who was known as Little Crotchet.
