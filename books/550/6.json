{"id":38854,"no":6,"title":"V. THE HUNT BEGINS.","content":"When Aaron left the negro woman at Gossett\u0027s he went rapidly through the woods until he came to the old fields that had once been cultivated, but were now neglected for newer and better soil. These deserted fields had been dismally naked of vegetation for years, and where they undulated into hills the storms had cut deep red gashes. But these wounds were now gradually healing. A few years before a company of travelers had camped out one night at Curtwright\u0027s factory, not many miles away, and where they fed their horses a grass new to that region—new, in fact, to this country—made its appearance. It grew and spread for miles around and covered the red hills with the most beautiful mantle that the southern summers had ever seen. It refused to wither and parch under the hot sun, but flourished instead. [93] It had crept from Curtwright\u0027s factory, and had already begun to carpet the discarded lands through which Aaron was now passing, and the turf felt as soft as velvet under his feet. The touch of it seemed to inspire his movements, for he began to trot; and he trotted until, at the end of half an hour, he struck into the plantation road leading to the Oconee. Aaron was making for the river. Having received fair warning, and guessing something of the character of Mr. Simmons, he had made up his mind that the best plan would be to get away from the dogs if possible. He hoped to find one of the Ward negroes at the river landing, and in this he was not disappointed. Old Uncle Andy, who was almost on the retired list, on account of his age and faithfulness, although he was still strong and vigorous, was just preparing to visit his set-hooks which were down the river. He was about to shove the boat into deep water and jump in when Aaron called him. \"Ah-yi,\" he answered in a tone almost gay, for he had a good master, and he had no troubles except the few that old age had brought on him. [94] \"Up or down?\" inquired Aaron. \"Down, honey; down. All de time down. Den I\u0027ll lef\u0027 um down dar an\u0027 let Rowan Ward\" (this was his master whom he talked about so familiarly) \"sen\u0027 one er his triflin\u0027 no \u0027count nigners atter um wid de waggin\u0027.\" \"I want to go up,\" said Aaron. \"I ain\u0027t henderin\u0027 you,\" replied old Uncle Andy. \"Whar yo\u0027 huffs? Walk. I ain\u0027t gwine pull you in dis boat. No. I won\u0027t pull Rowan Ward yit, en he know it. I won\u0027t pull nobody up stream in his boat less\u0027n it\u0027s Sally Ward\" (his mistress), \"en she\u0027d do ez much fer me. What yo\u0027 name, honey?\" \"Aaron, I\u0027m called.\" \"Ah-yi!\" exclaimed Old Uncle Andy, under his breath. \"Dey are atter you. Oh, yes! En what\u0027s mo\u0027 dey\u0027ll git you. En mo\u0027 dan dat, dey oughter git you! Dem Gossetts is rank pizen, en der niggers is pizen. A nigger what ain\u0027t got no better sense dan ter b\u0027long ter po\u0027 white trash ain\u0027t got no business ter git good treatment. Look at me! Dey ain\u0027t nobody dast ter lay de weight er der han\u0027 on me. Ef dey do, dey got ter whip Sally Ward en Rowan Ward. You ain\u0027t[95] bad ez dem yuther Gossett niggers, kaze you been in de woods en you er dar yit. Kensecontly you got one chance, en it\u0027s de onliest chance. Cross dis river en go up dar ter de house, en wake up Sally Ward en tell \u0027er dat ole Andy say she mus\u0027 buy you. Ef she hum en haw, des put yo\u0027 foot down en tell her dat ole Andy say she des got ter buy you. She\u0027ll do it! She\u0027ll know better\u0027n not ter do it. Ah-h-h-h!\" Aaron would have laughed at this display of self-importance, but he knew that to laugh would be to defeat the object he had in view. So his reply was very serious. \"She\u0027s good!\" cried old Uncle Andy. \"Dey\u0027s er heap er good wimmen, but dey ain\u0027t no \u0027oman like Sally Ward,—I don\u0027t keer ef she is got a temper. Ef folks is made out\u0027n dus\u0027 dey wuz des nuff er de kin\u0027 she wuz made out\u0027n fer ter make her. Dey wuz de greates\u0027 plenty fer ter make her, but dey wan\u0027t a pinch lef\u0027 over. How come you got ter go up de river?\" \"Wait a little while, and Simmons\u0027s dog\u0027ll tell you,\" replied Aaron. \"Jim Simmons? I wish I had Rowan Ward here ter do my cussin\u0027!\" exclaimed old Uncle[96] Andy, striking the edge of the bateau viciously. \"Kin you handle dish yer paddle? Git in dis boat, den! Jim Simmons! Much he look like ketchin\u0027 anybody. Git in dis boat, I tell you! En take dis paddle en he\u0027p me pull ef you want to go up de river.\" Aaron lost no time in getting in the bateau. Instead of sitting down he remained standing, and braced himself by placing one foot in advance of the other. In this position he leaned first on one side and then on the other as he swept the long, wide oar through the water. A few strokes carried him into the middle of the Oconee and nearly across. Then, out of the current and in the still water, Aaron headed the boat up stream. It was a long, heavy, unwieldy affair, built for carrying the field hands and the fruits of the harvest across the river, for the Ward plantation lay on both sides of the Oconee. The bateau was unwieldy, but propelled by Aaron\u0027s strong arms it moved swiftly and steadily up the stream. Old Uncle Andy had intended to help row the boat, but when he saw how easily Aaron managed it he made himself comfortable by holding his oar across his lap and talking. [97] \"I done year tell er you,\" he said. \"Some folks say you er nigger, en some say you ain\u0027t no nigger. I\u0027m wid dem what say you ain\u0027t no nigger, kaze you don\u0027t do like a nigger, en dey ain\u0027t no nigger in de roun\u0027 worl\u0027 what kin stan\u0027 up in dis boat an\u0027 shove it \u0027long like you doin\u0027. Dey all weak-kneed en wobbly when dey git on de water. I wish Sally Ward could see you now. She\u0027d buy you terreckly. Don\u0027t you want ter b\u0027long ter Sally Ward?\" \"No,—Abercrombie,\" replied Aaron. \"Yo\u0027 sho fly high,\" remarked old Uncle Andy. \"Dey er good folks, dem Abercrombies. Ef dey\u0027s anybody anywheres \u0027roun\u0027 dat\u0027s mos\u0027 ez good ez Sally Ward en Rowan Ward it\u0027s de Abercrombies. I\u0027ll say dat much an\u0027 not begrudge it. Speshally dat ar cripple boy. Dey tells me dat dat chil\u0027 don\u0027t never git tired er doin\u0027 good. En dat\u0027s a mighty bad sign; it\u0027s de wust kinder sign. You watch. De Lord done put his han\u0027 on dat chil\u0027, en he gwine take \u0027im back up dar whar he b\u0027longs at. When folks git good like dey say dat chil\u0027 is, dey are done ripe.\" To this Aaron made no reply. He had had the same or similar thoughts for some time. He[98] simply gave the waters of the river a stronger backward sweep with the oar. The shadows were still heavy on the water, and the overhanging trees helped to make them heavier, but the reflection of dawn caught and became entangled in the ripples made by the boat, and far away in the east the red signal lights of the morning gave forth a dull glow. The fact that Aaron made no comment on his remarks had no effect on Uncle Andy. He continued to talk incessantly, and when he paused for a moment it was to take breath and not to hear what his companion had to say. \"Jim Simmons. Huh. I wish Sally Ward could git de chance fer ter lay de law down ter dat man.\" (Uncle Andy had his wish later in the day). \"She\u0027d tell \u0027im de news. She\u0027d make \u0027im \u0027shamed er hisse\u0027f—gwine trollopin\u0027 roun\u0027 de country huntin\u0027 niggers en dem what ain\u0027t niggers, en all b\u0027longin\u0027 ter Gossett. How come dey ain\u0027t no niggers but de Gossett niggers in de woods? Tell me dat. You may go all \u0027roun\u0027 here for forty mile, en holler at eve\u0027y plantation gate en ax \u0027em how many niggers dey got in de woods, en dey\u0027ll tell you na\u0027er one. Dey\u0027ll tell[99] you ids twel you holler at de Gossett gate an\u0027 dar dey\u0027ll holler back: Forty-\u0027leven in de woods an\u0027 spectin\u0027 mo\u0027 ter foller. Now, how come dat? When you stoop in de road fer ter git a drink er water you kin allers tell when dey\u0027s sump\u0027n dead up de creek.\" Still Aaron swept the water back with his oar, and still the bateau went up stream. One mile—two miles—two miles and a half. At last Aaron headed the boat toward the shore. \"What you gwine ter lan\u0027 on the same side wid Jim Simmons fer?\" Uncle Andy inquired indignantly. \"Ain\u0027t you got no sense? Don\u0027t you know he\u0027ll ketch you ef you do dat? You reckon he gwine ter foller you ter de landin\u0027 en den turn right \u0027roun\u0027 in his tracks en go back?\" \"I\u0027ll hide in the big swamp,\" replied Aaron. \"Hide!\" exclaimed Uncle Andy. \"Don\u0027t you know dey done foun\u0027 out whar you stays at? A\u0027er one er dem Gossett niggers\u0027ll swap der soul\u0027s salvation fer a bellyful er vittles. Ef dey wuz ter ketch you des dry so, I\u0027d be sorry fer you, but ef you gwine ter run right in de trap, you\u0027ll hatter fin\u0027 some un else fer ter cry atter you. You put me in min\u0027 er de rabbit. Man come \u0027long[100] wid his dogs, en jump de rabbit out er his warm bed, en he done gone. Dogs take atter him, but dey ain\u0027t nowhar. He done out er sight. Den dey trail \u0027im en trail \u0027im, but dat ain\u0027t do no good. Rabbit done gone. De man, he let de dogs trail. He take his stan\u0027 right at de place whar rabbit jump fum. He prime he gun, en wink he eye. De dogs trail, en trail, en trail, en it seem like dey gwine out er hearin\u0027. Man stan\u0027 right still en wink de t\u0027er eye. En, bless gracious! \u0027fo\u0027 you know it, bang go de gun en down drap de rabbit. Stidder gwine on \u0027bout his business, he done come back en de man bag \u0027im. Dat \u0027zackly de way you gwine do—but go on, go on! De speckled pullet hollered shoo ter hawk, but what good did dat do?\" By this time the bateau had floated under a tree that leaned from the river bank over the water. Aaron laid his oar in the boat and steadied it by holding to a limb. Then he turned to Uncle Andy. \"Maybe some day I can help you. So long!\" He lifted himself into the tree. As he did so a dog ran down the bank whining. \"Wait!\" cried Uncle Andy. \"Wait, en look out! I hear[101] a dog in de bushes dar. Ef it\u0027s a Simmons dog drap back in de boat en I\u0027ll take you right straight to Sally Ward.\" \"It\u0027s my dog,\" said Aaron. \"He\u0027s been waiting for me.\" It was Rambler. \"Desso! I wish you mighty well, honey.\" With that Uncle Andy backed the boat out into the river, headed it down stream, and aided the current by an occasional stroke of his oar, which he knew well how to use. Standing on the hill above the river, Aaron saw that the red signal lights in the east had been put out, and it was now broad day. In the top of a pine a quarter of a mile away a faint shimmer of sunlight glowed a moment and then disappeared. Again it appeared and this time to stay. He stood listening, and it seemed to him that he could hear in the far-off distance the faint musical cry of hounds. Perhaps he was mistaken; perhaps it was a fox-hunting pack, or, perhaps— He turned and moved rapidly to the Swamp, which he found wide awake and ready to receive him. So vigorous was the Swamp, and so jealous of its possessions, that it rarely permitted the[102] summer sun to shine upon its secrets. If a stray beam came through, very well, but the Swamp never had a fair glimpse of the sun except in winter, when the glare was shorn of its heat, all the shadows pointing to the north, where the cold winds come from. At midday, in the season when the Swamp was ready for business, the shade was dense—dense enough to give the effect of twilight. At sunrise dawn had hardly made its way to the places where the mysteries wandered back and forth, led by Jack-o\u0027-the-Lantern. But the Willis-Whistlers knew when dawn came in the outer world, and they hid their shrill pipes in the canes and disappeared; but the mysteries still had an hour to frolic—an hour in which they might dispense with the services of Jack-o\u0027-the-Lantern. So Aaron found them there—all his old friends and a new one, the old brindle steer to whom he sometimes gave a handful of salt. The brindle steer was supposed to be superannuated, but he was not. He had the hollow horn, as the negroes called it, and this had made him thin and weak for a time, but he was now in fair trim, the Swamp proving to be a well-conducted hospital, stocked with an[103] abundance of pleasant medicine. He was not of the Swamp, but he had been taken in out of charity, and he was the more welcome on that account. Moreover, he had introduced himself to the White Pig in a sugarcane patch, and they got on famously together—one making luscious cuds of the green blades and the other smacking his mouth over the sweets to be found in the stalks. Aaron was glad to see the Brindle Steer, and Brindle was so glad to see Aaron that he must needs hoist his tail in the air and lower his horns, which were remarkably long and sharp, and pretend that he was on the point of charging, pawing the ground and making a noise with his mouth that was something between a bleat and a bellow. It was such a queer sound that Aaron laughed, seeing which Brindle shook his head and capered around the Son of Ben Ali as if trying to find some vulnerable point in his body that would offer small resistance to the long horns. \"You are well, Brindle,\" said Aaron. \"No, Son of Ben Ali, not well—only a great deal better,\" replied Brindle. \"That is something, Brindle; be glad, as I[104] am,\" remarked Aaron. \"You may have work to do to-day—with your horns.\" Brindle drew a long breath that sounded like a tremendous sigh. \"It is well you say with my horns, Son of Ben Ali. No cart for me. When the time comes for the cart I shall have—what do you call it?\" \"The hollow horn,\" suggested Aaron. \"Yes, two hollow horns, Son of Ben Ali. No cart for me. Though there is nothing the matter with my horns, the people shall believe that both are hollow. When I was sick, Son of Ben Ali, something was the matter with all nine of my stomachs.\" \"Nine! You have but three, Brindle,\" said Aaron. \"Only three, Son of Ben Ali? Well, when I was sick I thought there were nine of them. What am I to do to-day?\" \"Go not too far, Brindle. When you hear hounds running through the fields from the river come to the big poplar. There you will find me and the White Grunter.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2801/77472.html","bookId":550,"book":{"id":550,"title":"Aaron in the Wildwoods","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a large plantation in Middle Georgia a boy who was known as Little Crotchet.
