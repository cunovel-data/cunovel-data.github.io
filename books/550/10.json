{"id":38858,"no":10,"title":"IX. THE UPSETTING OF MR. GOSSETT.","content":"If Aaron had known it was Mr. Gossett\u0027s voice he heard and Mr. Gossett\u0027s hand that brought the buggy whip down on the poor horse\u0027s back with such cruel energy, the probability is that he would have taken to his heels; and yet it is impossible to say with certainty. The Son of Ben Ali was such a curious compound that his actions depended entirely on the mood he chanced to be in. He was full of courage, and yet was terribly afraid at times. He was dignified and proud, and yet no stranger to humility. His whole nature resented the idea of serving as a slave, yet he would have asked nothing better than to be Little Crotchet\u0027s slave: and he was glad to call Mr. Abercrombie master. So that, after all, it may be that he would have stood his ground, knowing that the voice and hand were Mr. Gossett\u0027s when his ears told him, as they now did, that the horse,[167] made furious by the cruel stroke of the whip, was running away, coming down the hill at breakneck speed. Mr. Gossett had been on a fruitless errand. When his son George reached home that morning and told him that Mr. Jim Simmons\u0027s dogs had followed the trail to the river and there lost it, Mr. Gossett remarked that he was glad he did not go on a fool\u0027s errand, and he made various statements about Mr. Simmons and his dogs that were not at all polite. Later in the day, however (though the hour was still early), when Mr. Gossett was making the customary round of his plantation, he fell in with a negro who had been hunting for some stray sheep. The negro, after giving an account of his movements, made this further remark:— \"I sholy \u0027spected you\u0027d be over yander wid Mr. Jim Simmons, Marster. His dogs done struck a track leadin\u0027 inter de swamp, an\u0027 dey sho went a callyhootin\u0027.\" \"When was that?\" Mr. Gossett inquired. \"Not mo\u0027 dan two hours ago, ef dat,\" responded the negro. \"I lis\u0027n at um, I did, an\u0027 dey went right spang tor\u0027ds de Swamp. I know\u0027d de dogs, kaze I done hear um soon\u0027 dis mornin\u0027.\" [168] Giving the negro some instructions that would keep him busy the rest of the day if he carried them out, Mr. Gossett turned his horse\u0027s head in the direction of the Swamp, and rode slowly thither. The blue falcon soared high in the air and paid no attention to Mr. Gossett. For various reasons that the Swamp knew about the Turkey Buzzard was not in sight. The Swamp itself was full of the reposeful silence that daylight usually brought to it. Mr. Gossett rode about and listened; but if all the dogs in the world had suddenly disappeared, the region round about could not have been freer of their barking and baying than it was at that moment. All that Mr. Gossett could do was to turn about and ride back home. But he was very much puzzled. If Mr. Simmons had trailed a runaway into the Swamp and caught him, or if he had made two failures in one morning, Mr. Gossett would like very much to know it. In point of fact, he was such a practical business man that he felt it was Mr. Simmons\u0027s duty to make some sort of report to him. In matters of this kind Mr. Gossett was very precise. But after dinner he felt in a more jocular mood.[169] He informed his son George that he thought he would go over and worry Mr. Simmons a little over his failure to catch Aaron, and he had his horse put to the buggy, and rode six or seven miles to Mr. Simmons\u0027s home, smiling grimly as he went along. Mr. Simmons was at home, but was not feeling very well, as his wife informed Mr. Gossett. Mrs. Simmons herself was in no very amiable mood, as Mr. Gossett very soon observed. But she asked him in politely enough, and said she\u0027d go and tell Jimmy that company had come. She went to the garden gate not very far from the house and called out to her husband in a shrill voice:— \"Jimmy! Oh, Jimmy! That old buzzard of a Gossett is in the house. Come see what he wants. And do put on your coat before you come in the house. And wash your hands. They\u0027re dirtier than sin. And hit that shock of yours one lick with the comb and brush. Come right on now. If I have to sit in there and talk to the old rascal long I\u0027ll have a fit. Ain\u0027t you coming? I\u0027ll run back before he ransacks the whole house.\" Mr. Simmons came sauntering in after a while, and his wife made that the excuse for disappearing,[170] though she went no further than the other side of the door, where she listened with all her ears, being filled with a consuming curiosity to know what business brought Mr. Gossett to that house. She had not long to wait, for the visitor plunged into the subject at once. \"You may know I was anxious about you, Simmons, or I wouldn\u0027t be here.\" (\"The old hypocrite!\" remarked Mrs. Simmons, on the other side of the door.) \"You didn\u0027t come by when your hunt ended, and I allowed maybe that you had caught the nigger and either killed or crippled him, and—ahem!—felt a sort of backwardness in telling me about it. So I thought I would come over and see you, if only to say that whether you caught the nigger or killed him, he\u0027s responsible for it and not you.\" \"No, Colonel, I\u0027m not in the practice of killing niggers nor crippling \u0027em. I\u0027ve caught a many of \u0027em, but I\u0027ve never hurt one yet. But, Colonel! If you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 gone through with what I\u0027ve been through this day, you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 done exactly what I done. You\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 went right straight home without stopping to ask questions or to answer \u0027em—much less tell tales.\" [171] Thereupon Mr. Simmons told the story of his adventure in the Swamp, varnishing up the facts as he thought he knew them, and adding some details calculated to make the episode much more interesting from his point of view. It will be remembered that Mr. Simmons was in total ignorance of what really happened in the Swamp. He had conceived the theory that his dogs had hit upon the trail of a wildcat going from the river to its den in the Swamp, and that, when the dogs had followed it there, they had been attacked, not by one wildcat, but by the whole \"caboodle\" of wildcats, to use Mr. Simmons\u0027s expression. Having conceived this theory, Mr. Simmons not only stuck to it, but added various incidents that did credit to his imagination. For instance, he made this statement in reply to a question from Mr. Gossett:— \"What did I think when I heard all the racket and saw Sound come out mangled? Well, I\u0027ll tell you, Colonel, I didn\u0027t know what to think. I never heard such a terrible racket in all my born days. I says to myself, \u0027I\u0027ll just ride in and see what the trouble is, and if there ain\u0027t but one wildcat, why, I\u0027ll soon put an end to him.\u0027 So I[172] spurred my hoss up, and started in; but before we went anyways, hardly, the hoss give a snort and tried to whirl around and run out. \"It made me mad at the time,\" Mr. Simmons went on, his inventive faculty rising to the emergency, \"but, Colonel, it\u0027s a mighty good thing that hoss had more sense than I did, because if he hadn\u0027t I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 never been setting here telling you about it. I tried to make the hoss stand, but he wouldn\u0027t, and, just then, what should I see but two great big wildcats trying to sneak up on me? And all the time, Colonel, the racket in the Swamp was getting louder and louder. Pluto was in there somewheres, and I know\u0027d he was attending to his business, so I just give the hoss the reins and he went like he was shot out of a gun.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2801/77476.html","bookId":550,"book":{"id":550,"title":"Aaron in the Wildwoods","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a large plantation in Middle Georgia a boy who was known as Little Crotchet.
