{"id":38852,"no":4,"title":"III. WHAT CHUNKY RILEY SAW AND HEARD","content":"Left alone, Chunky Riley stood still and tried to trace in his mind the route he and Aaron had followed in coming from the Swamp. But he could make no mental map—and he knew every \"nigh-cut\" and by-path for miles around—that would fit in with the time it had taken them to reach the spot where he now stood. He looked back toward the Swamp, but the night covered it, and he could see nothing. Then he looked around him, to see if he knew his present whereabouts. Oh, yes, that was easy; every foot of ground was familiar. The hill on which he had stood had been given over to scrub pines. The hill itself sloped away to the Turner old fields. But still he was puzzled, and still he scratched his head, for he knew that the Swamp was a good four miles away—nearly five—and it seemed to him that he and Aaron[57] had been only a few minutes in making the journey. So he scratched his head and wondered to himself whether Aaron was really a \"conjur\u0027 man.\" It was perhaps very lucky for Chunky Riley that he stopped when he did. If he had kept on he would have run into the arms of three men who were going along the plantation path that led from Gossett\u0027s negro quarters to the Abercrombie Place. The delay that Chunky Riley made prevented him from meeting them, but it did not prevent him from hearing the murmur of their voices as he struck into the path. They were too far off for Chunky Riley to know whether they were white or black, but just as he turned into the path to go to Gossett\u0027s the scent of a cigar floated to his nostrils. He paused and scratched his head again. He knew by the scent of the cigar that the voices he heard belonged to white men: but who were they? If they were the \"patterollers\" they\u0027d catch Aaron beyond all question; it would be impossible for him to escape. So thought Chunky Riley, and so thinking, he turned and followed the path towards the Abercrombie Place. He moved rapidly but cautiously.[58] The scent of the cigar grew stronger, the sound of men\u0027s voices fell more distinctly on his ear. Chunky Riley left the path and skirted through the low pines until he came to the fence that inclosed the spring lot. He knew that if he was heard, the men would think he was a calf, or, mayhap, a mule; for the hill on which Aaron had left him was now a part of a great pasture, in which the calves and dry cattle and (between seasons) the mules were allowed to roam at will. Coming to the fence, Chunky Riley would have crossed it, but the voices were louder now, and he caught a glimpse of the red sparks of lighted cigars. Creeping closer and closer, but ever ready to drop on the ground and run away on all-fours, Chunky Riley was soon able to hear what the men were saying. He knew the voices of his master and young master, Mr. Gossett—Old Grizzle, as he was called—and George, and he rightly judged that the strange voice mingling with theirs belonged to Mr. Jim Simmons, who, with a trained pack of hounds,—\"nigger dogs\" they were called,—held himself at the service of owners of runaway negroes. Mr. Simmons\u0027s average fee was $15—that is[59] to say when he was \"called in time.\" But in special cases his charge was $30. When Chunky Riley arrived within earshot of the group, Mr. Gossett was just concluding a protest that he had made against the charge of $30, which he had reluctantly agreed to pay for the capture of Aaron. \"You stayed at my house to-day, you\u0027ll stay there to-night, and maybe you\u0027ll come back to dinner to-morrow. There\u0027s the feeding of you and your dogs. You don\u0027t take any account of that at all.\" Mr. Gossett\u0027s voice was sharp and emphatic. His stinginess was notorious in that region, and gave rise to the saying that Gossett loved a dollar better than he did his wife. But he was no more ashamed of his stinginess than he was of the shabbiness of his hat. \"But, Colonel,\" remonstrated Mr. Jim Simmons, \"didn\u0027t you send for me? Didn\u0027t you say, \u0027Glad to see you, Simmons; walk right in and make yourself at home\u0027? You did, fer a fact.\" He spoke with a drawl that irritated the snappy and emphatic Mr. Gossett. \"Why, certainly, Simmons; certainly I did. I[60] mentioned the matter to show you that your charges are out of all reason in this case. All you have to do is to come here with your dogs in the morning, skirt around the place, pick up his trail, and there you are.\" \"But, Colonel!\" insisted Mr. Jim Simmons with his careless, irritating drawl, \"ain\u0027t it a plum\u0027 fact that this nigger\u0027s been in the woods a month or sech a matter? Ain\u0027t it a plum\u0027 fact that you\u0027ve tracked him and trailed him with your own dogs?—and good dogs they are, and I\u0027ll tell anybody so. Now what do you pay me fer? Fer catching the nigger? No, sirree! The nigger\u0027s as good as caught now—when it comes to that. You pay me fer knowing how to catch him—that\u0027s what you pay me fer. You send fer the doctor. He comes and fumbles around a little, and you have to pay the bill whether he kills or cures. You don\u0027t pay him fer killing or curing; you pay him fer knowing how to fumble around. It\u0027s some different with me. If I don\u0027t catch your nigger, you button up your pocket. If I do catch him you pay me $30 down, not fer catching him, but fer knowing how to fumble around and catch him.\" [61] The logic of this argument, which was altogether lost on Chunky Riley, silenced Mr. Gossett, but did not convince him. There was a long pause, as if all three of the men were wrestling with peculiar thoughts. Finally Mr. Gossett spoke:— \"It ain\u0027t so much the nigger I\u0027m after, but I want to show Abercrombie that I can\u0027t be outdone. He\u0027s laughing in his sleeve because I can\u0027t keep the nigger at home, and I\u0027ll be blamed\"—here his voice sank to a confidential tone—\"I\u0027ll be blamed if I don\u0027t believe that, between him and that son of his, they are harboring the nigger. Yes, sir, harboring is the word.\" Mr. Jim Simmons threw down his lighted cigar with such energy as to cause the sparks to fly in all directions. A cigar was an unfamiliar luxury to Mr. Simmons, and he had had enough of it. \"Addison Abercrombie harboring a nigger!\" exclaimed Mr. Simmons. \"Why, Colonel, if every man, woman, and child in the United States was to tell me that I wouldn\u0027t believe it. Addison Abercrombie! Why, Colonel, though you\u0027re his next-door neighbor, as you may say, you don\u0027t[62] know him half as well as I do. You ought to get acquainted with that man.\" \"Humph! I know him well enough, I reckon,\" responded Mr. Gossett. \"I went to school with him. Folks get to know one another at school. He was always stuck up, trying to hold his head higher than anybody else because his daddy had money and a big plantation. I made my prop\u0027ty myself; I earned every dollar; and I know how it came.\" \"But, Colonel!\" Mr. Jim Simmons insisted, \"Addison Abercrombie would hold his head high if he never seen a dollar, and he\u0027d have the right to do it. Him harbor niggers? Shucks, Colonel! You might as well tell me that the moon ain\u0027t nothing but a tater pudding.\" \"What do you see in the man?\" Mr. Gossett asked with some irritation in the tones of his voice. There was a pause, as though Mr. Simmons was engaged in getting his thoughts together. Finally he said:— \"Well, Colonel, I don\u0027t reckon I can make it plain to you, because when I come to talk about it I can\u0027t grab the identical idee that would fit[63] what I\u0027ve got in my mind. But I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s the honest truth, in my opinion—and I\u0027m not by myself, by a long shot—Addison Abercrombie is as fine a man as ever trod shoe leather. That\u0027s what.\" \"Humph!\" grunted Mr. Gossett. \"Yes, sirree!\" persisted Mr. Simmons, warming up a little. \"It makes no difference where you see him, nor when you see him, nor how you see him, you can up and say: \u0027The Lord has made many men of many minds, and many men of many kinds, but not sence Adam has he made a better man than Addison Abercrombie.\u0027 That\u0027s the way I look at it, Colonel. I may be wrong, but if I am I\u0027ll never find it out in this world.\" Plainly, Mr. Gossett was not prepared to hear such a tribute as this paid to Addison Abercrombie, and he winced under it. He hemmed and hawed, as the saying is, and changed his position on the fence. He was thoroughly disgusted. Now there was no disagreement between Mr. Gossett and Mr. Abercrombie,—no quarrel, that is to say,—but Gossett knew that Abercrombie regarded him with a feeling akin to contempt. He treasured in his mind a remark that Abercrombie[64] had made about him the day he bought Aaron from the negro speculator. He never forgot nor forgave it, for it was an insinuation that Mr. Gossett, in spite of his money and his thrifty ways, was not much of a gentleman. On this particular subject Mr. Gossett was somewhat sensitive, as men are who have doubts in their own minds as to their standing. Mr. Gossett had an idea that money and \"prop\u0027ty,\" as he called it, made a gentleman; but it was a very vague idea, and queer doubts sometimes pestered him. It was these doubts that made him \"touchy\" on this subject. \"What has this great man ever done for you, Simmons?\" Mr. Gossett asked, with a contemptuous snort. \"Not anything, Colonel, on the top of the green globe. I went to him once to borrow some money, and he wanted to lend it to me without taking my note and without charging me any interest. I says to him, says I, \u0027You\u0027ll have to excuse me.\u0027\" \"That was right; you did perfectly right, Simmons. The man was trying to insult you.\" \"But, Colonel, he didn\u0027t go about it that way.[65] Don\u0027t you reckon you could tell when anybody was trying to insult you? That was the time I come to you.\" \"I charged you interest, didn\u0027t I, Simmons?\" \"You did, Colonel, fer a fact.\" \"I\u0027m this kind of a man, Simmons,\" remarked Mr. Gossett, with a touch of sincere pride and gratification in his voice. \"When I do business with a man I do business. When I do him a favor it must be outside of business. It\u0027s mixing the two things up that keeps so many people poor.\" \"What two things, Colonel?\" gravely inquired Simmons. \"Why the doing of business and—er—the doing of favors.\" \"Oh, I see,\" said Mr. Simmons, as if a great light had been turned on the matter. Then he laughed and continued: \"Yes, Colonel, I borrowed the money from you and just about that time the fever taken me down, and if it hadn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 been fer Addison Abercrombie the note I give you would have swallowed my house and land.\" \"Is that so?\" inquired Mr. Gossett. \"Ask my wife,\" replied Mr. Simmons. \"One[66] day while I was out of my head with the fever, Addison Abercrombie, he rid by and saw my wife setting on the front steps, jest a-boohooing,—you know how wimmen will do, Colonel; if they ain\u0027t a-jawing they\u0027re a-cryin\u0027. So Addison Abercrombie, he ups and asks her what\u0027s the matter, and Jennie, she tells him. He got right off his hoss and come in, and set by my bed the better part of the morning. And all that time there I was a-running on about notes and a-firing off my troubles in the air. So the upshot of the business was that Addison Abercrombie left the money there to pay the note and left word for me to pay him back when I got good and ready; and Jennie hadn\u0027t hardly dried her eyes before here come a nigger on horseback with a basket on his arm, and in the basket was four bottles of wine. Wine! Why, Colonel, it was worse\u0027n wine. Jennie says that if arry one of the bottles had \u0027a\u0027 had a load of buckshot in it, the roof would \u0027a\u0027 been blow\u0027d off when the stopper flew out. And, Colonel! if ever you feel like taking a right smart of exercise, jest pass my house some day and stick your head over the palings and tell Jennie that Addison Abercrombie\u0027s got a streak of meanness in him.\" [67] \"Have you ever paid Abercrombie?\" Mr. Gossett inquired. His voice was harsh and businesslike. \"I was laying off to catch this nigger of yours and pay him some on account,\" replied Mr. Simmons. \"Why, it has been three years since you paid me,\" suggested Mr. Gossett. \"Two years or sech a matter,\" remarked Mr. Simmons complacently. \"Then that\u0027s the reason you think Abercrombie ain\u0027t harboring my nigger?\" inquired Mr. Gossett scornfully. \"But, Colonel,\" drawled Mr. Simmons, \"what under the sun ever got the idee in your head that Addison Abercrombie is harboring your nigger?\" \"It\u0027s as simple as a-b ab,\" Mr. Gossett replied with energy. \"He tried to buy the nigger off the block and couldn\u0027t, and now he thinks I\u0027ll sell if the nigger\u0027ll stay in the woods long enough. That\u0027s the reason he\u0027s harboring the nigger. And more than that: don\u0027t I know from my own niggers that the yaller rapscallion comes here every chance he gets? He comes,[68] but he don\u0027t go in the nigger quarters. Now, where does he go?\" \"Yes, where?\" said Mr. Gossett\u0027s son George, who up to that moment had taken no part in the conversation. \"Three times this month I\u0027ve dealt out an extra rasher of bacon to two of our hands, and they tell the same tale.\" \"It looks quare,\" Mr. Simmons admitted, \"but as sure as you\u0027re born Addison Abercrombie ain\u0027t the man to harbor a runaway nigger. If he\u0027s ever had a nigger in the woods, it\u0027s more\u0027n I know, and when that\u0027s the case you may set it down fer a fact that he don\u0027t believe in runaway niggers.\" This was a lame argument, but it was the best that Mr. Simmons could muster at the moment. \"No,\" remarked Mr. Gossett sarcastically, \"his niggers don\u0027t take to the woods because they do as they blamed please at home. It sets my teeth on edge to see the way things are run on this plantation. Why, I could take the stuff that\u0027s flung away here and get rich on it in five years. It\u0027s a scandal.\" \"I believe you!\" assented his son George dutifully. [69] Chunky Riley heard this conversation by snatches, but he caught the drift of it. What he remembered of it was that some of his fellow servants were ready to tell all they knew for an extra \"rasher\" of meat, and that the hunt for Aaron would begin the next morning,—and it was now getting along toward dawn. He wanted to warn Aaron again. He wanted especially to tell Aaron that three men were sitting on the fence waiting for him. But this was impossible. The hour was approaching when Chunky Riley must be in his cabin on the Gossett plantation ready to go to work with the rest of the hands. He had slept soundly the first half of the night, and he would be as fresh in the field when the sun rose as those who had slept the night through. As he turned away from the fence a dog in the path leading from the spring to the stile suddenly began to bay. The men tried to drive him away, and one of them threw a stick at him, but the dog refused to be intimidated. He bayed them more fiercely, but finally retreated toward the spring, stopping occasionally to bark at the men on the fence. \"If I\u0027m not mistaken,\" remarked Mr. Gossett,[70] \"that\u0027s my dog Rambler. I know his voice, and he\u0027s been missing ever since that nigger went to the woods. I wonder if he\u0027s taken up over here? George, I wish you\u0027d make it convenient to come over here as soon as you can, and find out whether Rambler is here. Now, there\u0027s a dog, Simmons, that\u0027s away ahead of anything you\u0027ve got in the shape of a nigger dog,—nose as cold as ice, and as much sense as the common run of folks.\" \"He ain\u0027t doing you much good,\" responded Mr. Simmons. \"That\u0027s a fact,\" said Mr. Gossett. \"Till I heard that dog barking I thought Rambler had been killed by that nigger.\" Chunky Riley struck into the plantation path leading to Gossett\u0027s, at the point where the three men had tied their horses. They had ridden as far as they thought prudent, considering the errand they were on, and then they dismounted and made their horses fast to the overhanging limbs of a clump of oaks, which, for some reason or other, had been left standing in the field. One of the horses whinnied when Chunky Riley came near, and the negro paused. Aaron would[71] have known that the horse said, \"Please take me home, and be quick about it; I\u0027m hungry;\" but Chunky Riley could only guess. And as he guessed a thought struck him—a thought that made him scratch his head and chuckle. He turned in his tracks, went back along the path a little way, and listened. Then he returned, and the horse whinnied again. The creature was growing impatient. Once more Chunky Riley indulged in a hearty laugh, slapping himself softly on the leg. Then he went to the horses one by one, pulled down the swinging limbs to which their bridle reins were fastened, and untied them. This done, he proceeded to make himself \"mighty skace,\" as he expressed it. He started toward home at a rapid trot, without pausing to listen. But even without listening, he could hear the horses coming after him, Mr. Simmons\u0027s horse with the others. The faster he trotted the faster the horses trotted; and when Chunky Riley began to run the horses broke into a gallop, and came clattering along the path after him, their stirrups flying wildly about and making a clamor that Chunky[72] Riley had not bargained for. The faster he ran the faster the horses galloped, until at last it seemed to him that the creatures were trying to run him down. This idea took possession of his mind, and at once his fears magnified the situation. He imagined the horses were right at his heels. He could feel the hot breath of one of them on the back of his neck. Fortunately for Chunky Riley there was a fence at the point where the path developed into a lane. Over this he climbed and fell exhausted, fully expecting the horses to climb over or break through and trample him under their feet. But his expectations were not realized; the horses galloped along the lane, and presently he could hear them clattering along the big road toward Gossett\u0027s. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2801/77470.html","bookId":550,"book":{"id":550,"title":"Aaron in the Wildwoods","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a large plantation in Middle Georgia a boy who was known as Little Crotchet.
