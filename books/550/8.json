{"id":38856,"no":8,"title":"VII. AARON SEES THE SIGNAL.","content":"The Swamp had a fine frolic on the night of the day that it routed Mr. Simmons\u0027s dogs, but Aaron was not there to see it. He knew that, for some days at least, he would be free from active pursuit. The only danger he would have to encounter would come from the patrollers,—the negroes called them \"patterollers,\"—who visited the various plantations at uncertain intervals. If he began to go about with too much confidence it was entirely possible he would run into the arms of the patrollers, and he would have small opportunity to escape. Therefore, while he knew that he would not be hunted by dogs for some time to come, he also knew he must be constantly on the alert to guard against surprises. The most active member of the patrol was George Gossett himself; and after he and his companions had visited Mr. Fullalove\u0027s distillery, which they[130] never failed to do when they went patrolling, they were not in a condition to be entirely responsible for their actions. They had nothing to restrain them on such occasions except the knowledge that some of the owners of the negroes would jump at an excuse to hold them to personal account. And this was not a pleasant result to contemplate, especially after a night\u0027s spree. For these reasons Aaron was much more anxious to elude George Gossett and the patrollers than he was to escape from Mr. Jim Simmons\u0027s hounds. He knew he must avoid the negro cabins, which were traps for the unwary when the patrollers were around, and he knew he must keep off the public road—the \"big road,\" as it was called—and not venture too often on the frequently traveled plantation paths. Young Gossett and his companions had a way of dismounting from their horses out of sight and hearing of the negro quarters on the plantations that lay on their \"beat.\" Leaving the animals in charge of one man, they would cautiously post themselves at the various fence crossings and paths frequented by the negroes, and in this way capture all who were going to the negro quarters[131] or coming away. If a negro had a \"pass\" or a permit from his master, well and good. If he had none—well, it would be a sorry night\u0027s frolic for him. But Aaron had one great advantage over all the slaves who went to and fro between the plantations after nightfall. He had Rambler to warn him; and yet, after an experience that he had on one occasion, he felt that he must be more cautious than ever. It happened not many weeks before he was hunted by Mr. Simmons\u0027s hounds. In trying to kill a moccasin, Rambler had the misfortune to be bitten by the serpent. The wound was on his jowl, and in spite of all that Aaron could do the poor dog\u0027s head and neck swelled fearfully. When night came the Son of Ben Ali made Rambler as comfortable as possible, bruising herbs and barks and binding them to the wound, and making him a soft bed. On that particular night Aaron felt that he ought to visit the Little Master, and yet he was doubtful about it. He finally concluded to wait until late, and then go to the hill where, a few weeks later, he parted from Chunky Riley. If a[132] light was shining behind the Little Master\u0027s curtain he would go and drive the red goblin, Pain, from the room. He went to the hill, and the light was shining. The little red goblin was up to his old tricks. As he went along Aaron fell to thinking about the Little Master, and wondering why the child should be constantly given over to suffering. He forgot all about himself in trying to solve this problem, forgot to be cautious, forgot that he was a fugitive, and went blindly along the path to the fence above the spring lot. There, without warning, he found himself face to face with George Gossett. The rest of the patrollers were posted about at various points. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2801/77474.html","bookId":550,"book":{"id":550,"title":"Aaron in the Wildwoods","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a large plantation in Middle Georgia a boy who was known as Little Crotchet.
