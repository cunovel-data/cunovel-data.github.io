{"id":38851,"no":3,"title":"II. THE SECRETS OF THE SWAMP.","content":"However hard and fast the door of the Swamp may be locked at night, however tightly it may be shut, it opens quickly enough to whomsoever carries the key. There is no creaking of its vast and heavy hinges; there is not the faintest flutter of a leaf, nor the softest whisper of a blade of grass. That is the bargain the bearer of the key must make:— That which sleeps, disturb not its slumber. That which moves, let it swiftly pass. Else the Swamp will never reveal itself. The sound of one alien footfall is enough. It is the signal for each secret to hide itself, and for all the mysteries to vanish into mystery. The Swamp calls them all in, covers them as with a mantle, and puts on its every-day disguise,—the disguise that the eyes of few mortals have ever penetrated. But those who stand by the bargain[39] that all key-bearers must make—whether they go on two legs or on four, whether they fly or crawl or creep or swim—find the Swamp more friendly. There is no disguise anywhere. The secrets come swarming forth from all possible or impossible places; and the mysteries, led by their torch-bearer Jack-o\u0027-the-Lantern, glide through the tall canes and move about among the tall trees. The unfathomable blackness of night never sets foot here. It is an alien and is shut out. And this is one of the mysteries. If, when the door of the Swamp is opened to a key-bearer the black night seems to have crept in, wait a moment,—have patience. It is a delusion. Underneath this leafy covering, in the midst of this dense growth of vines and saw-grass and reeds and canes, there is always a wonderful hint of dawn—a shadowy, shimmering hint, elusive and indescribable, but yet sufficient to give dim shape to that which is near at hand. Not far away the frightened squeak of some small bird breaks sharply on the ear of the Swamp. This is no alien note, and Jack-o\u0027-the-Lantern dances up and down, and all the mysteries whisper in concert:— [40] \"We wish you well, Mr. Fox. Don\u0027t choke yourself with the feathers. Good-night, Mr. Fox, good-night!\" Two minute globules of incandescent light come into sight and disappear, and the mysteries whisper:— \"Too late, Mr. Mink, too late! Better luck next time. Good-night!\" A rippling sound is heard in the lagoon as the Leander of the Swamp slips into the water. Jack-o\u0027-the-Lantern flits to the level shore of the pool, and the mysteries come sweeping after, sighing:— \"Farewell, Mr. Muskrat! Good luck and good-night!\" Surely there is an alien sound on the knoll yonder,—snapping, growling, and fighting. Have stray dogs crept under the door? Oh, no! The Swamp smiles, and all the mysteries go trooping thither to see the fun. It is a wonderful frolic! Mr. Red Fox has met Mr. Gray Fox face to face. Something tells Mr. Red Fox \"Here\u0027s your father\u0027s enemy.\" Something whispers to Mr. Gray, \"Here\u0027s your mother\u0027s murderer.\" And so they fall to, screaming and gnawing and panting and snarling. Mr. Gray Fox is the strongest, but his heart is the weakest. Without warning he turns tail and flies, with Mr. Red Fox after him, and with all the mysteries keeping them company. They run until they are past the boundary line,—the place where the trumpet flower tried to marry the black-jack tree,—and then, of course, the Swamp has no further concern with them. And the mysteries and their torch-bearers come trooping home. pag40ilo MR. RED FOX MEETS MR. GRAY FOX [41] It is fun when Mr. Red Fox and Mr. Gray Fox meet on the knoll, but the Swamp will never have such a frolic as it had one night when a strange bird came flying in over the door. It is known that the birds that sleep while the Swamp is awake have been taught to hide their heads under their wings. It is not intended that they should see what is going on. Even the Buzzard, that sleeps in the loblolly pine, and the wild turkey, that sleeps in the live oak, conform to this custom. They are only on the edge of the Swamp, but they feel that it would be rude not to put their heads under their wings while the Swamp is awake. But this strange bird—of a family of night birds not hitherto known to that[42] region—was amazed when he beheld the spectacle. \"Oho!\" he cried; \"what queer country is this, where all the birds are headless? If I\u0027m to live here in peace, I must do as the brethren do.\" So he went off in search of advice. As he went along he saw the Bull-Frog near the lagoon. \"Queerer still,\" exclaimed the stranger. \"Here is a bird that has no head, and he can sing.\" This satisfied him, and he went farther until he saw Mr. Wildcat trying to catch little Mr. Flying-Squirrel. \"Good-evening, sir,\" said the stranger. \"I see that the birds in this country have no heads.\" Mr. Wildcat smiled and bowed and licked his mouth. \"I presume, sir, that I ought to get rid of my head if I am to stay here, and I have nowhere else to go. How am I to do it?\" \"Easy enough,\" responded Mr. Wildcat, smiling and bowing and licking his mouth. \"Birds that are so unfortunate as to have heads frequently come to me for relief. May I examine your neck to see what can be done?\" The strange bird fully intended to say, \"Why,[43] certainly, sir!\" He had the words all made up, but his head was off before he could speak. Being a large bird, he fluttered and shook his wings and jumped about a good deal. As the noise was not alien, the Swamp and all its mysteries came forth to investigate, and oh, what a frolic there was when Mr. Wildcat related the facts! The torch-bearers danced up and down with glee, and the mysteries waltzed to the quick piping of the Willis-Whistlers. Although the Swamp was not a day older when Aaron, the Son of Ben Ali, became a key-bearer, the frolic over the headless bird was far back of Aaron\u0027s time. Older! The Swamp was even younger, for it was not a Swamp until old age had overtaken it—until centuries had made it fresh and green and strong. The Indians had camped round about, had tried to run its mysteries down, and had failed. Then came a band of wandering Spaniards, with ragged clothes, and tarnished helmets, and rusty shields, and neighing horses—the first the Swamp had ever seen. The Spaniards floundered in at one side—where the trumpet vine tried to marry the black-jack tree—and floundered out on the other side more[44] bedraggled than ever. This was a great victory for the Swamp, and about that time it came to know and understand itself. For centuries it had been \"organizing,\" and when it pulled De Soto\u0027s company of Spaniards in at one side and flung them out at the other, considerably the worse for wear, it felt that the \"organization\" was complete. And so it was and had been for years and years, and so it remained thereafter—a quiet place when the sun was above the trees, but wonderfully alert and alive when night had fallen. The Swamp that Aaron knew was the same that the Indians and Spaniards had known. The loblolly pine had grown, and the big poplars on the knoll had expanded a trifle with the passing centuries, but otherwise the Swamp was the same. And yet how different! The Indians had not found it friendly, and the Spaniards regarded it as an enemy; but to Aaron it gave shelter, and sometimes food, and its mysteries were his companions. Jack-o\u0027-the-Lantern showed him the hidden paths when the mists of night fell darker than usual. He became as much a part of the Swamp as the mysteries were, entering into its life, and becoming native to all its moods and[45] conditions. And his presence there seemed to give the Swamp new responsibilities. Its thousand eyes were always watching for his enemies, and its thousand tongues were always ready to whisper the news of the coming of an alien. The turkey buzzard, soaring thousands of feet above the top of the great pine, the blue falcon, suspended in the air a mile away, the crow, flapping lazily across the fields, stood sentinel during the day, and the Swamp understood the messages they sent. At night the Willis-Whistlers were on guard, and their lines extended for miles in all directions, and the Swamp itself was awake, and needed no warning message. Sometimes at night the sound of Randall\u0027s trumpet fell on the ear of the Swamp, or the voice of Uncle Fountain was heard lifted up in song, as he went over the hills to his fish-baskets in the river; and these were restful and pleasing sounds. Sometimes the trailing cry of hounds was heard. If in the day, Rambler, the track dog, would listen until he knew whether the cry came from Jim Simmons\u0027s \"nigger dogs,\" from the Gossett hounds, or from some other pack. If at night, the Swamp cared little about it, for it was used to these things after the sun went down. [46] Mr. Coon insisted on gadding about, and it served him right, the Swamp insisted, when the hounds picked up his drag—as the huntsmen say—and brought him home with a whirl. He was safe when he got there, for let the hounds bay at the door of his house as long as they might, no hunter with torch and axe would venture into the Swamp. They had tried it—oh, many times. But the door was locked, and the key Was safely kid in a hollow tree. If it was merely Cousin Coon who lived up the river, well and good. It would teach the incurable vagrant a lesson, and the Swamp enjoyed the fun. The Willis-Whistlers stopped to listen, the mysteries hid behind the trees, and Jack-o\u0027-the-Lantern extinguished his torch as the hounds came nearer with their quavering cries. Was it Mr. Coon or Cousin Coon? Why, Cousin Coon, of course. How did the Swamp know? It was the simplest thing in the world. Wasn\u0027t there a splash and a splutter as he ran into the quagmire? Wasn\u0027t there a snap and a snarl when the partridge-pea vine caught his foot? Did he know the paths? Didn\u0027t he double and turn and go back[47] the way he came, to be caught and killed on dry land? Would Mr. Coon of the Swamp ever be caught on dry land? Don\u0027t you believe it! If cut off from home, he would run to the nearest pond and plunge in. Once there, was there a hound that would venture to take a bath with him? The Swamp laughed at the thought of such a thing. Aaron smiled, the White Pig grunted, and Rambler grinned. Cousin Coon is no more, but Mr. Coon is safe at home and the Swamp knows it. Good luck to all who know the way, By crooked path and clinging vine! For them Night\u0027s messengers shall stay, For them the laggard moon shall shine. But it was not always that aliens and strangers were unwelcome. Occasionally in the still hours between midnight and dawn the Swamp would open its doors to Gossett\u0027s Riley. He had no key and he had never come to know and feel that the Swamp was something more than a mixture of mud and water, trees, canes, vines, and all manner of flying, creeping, and crawling things. To him the Swamp was merely a place and not a Thing, but this was ignorance, and the[48] Swamp forgave it for various reasons, forgave it and pitied him as he deserved to be pitied. And yet he had qualities out of the common, and for these the Swamp admired him. He was little more than a dwarf, being \"bow-legged and chuckle-headed,\" as Susy\u0027s Sam used to say, and was called Chunky Riley, but he was very much of a man for all that. At a log-rolling there was not a negro for miles around who could pull him down with the handstick. Aaron could do it, but Aaron was not a negro, but an Arab, and that is different. Chunky Riley was even stronger in limb and body than Aaron, but Aaron used his head, as well as body and limb—and that also is different. Riley was not swift of foot, but he could run far, as Gossett\u0027s hounds well knew. More than that, he could go on all-fours almost as fast as he could run on two legs, and that was something difficult to do. The Swamp found Chunky Riley out in a very curious way. The first time he came to bring a message to Aaron he waited for no introduction whatever. The Willis-Whistlers warned him, but he paid no attention to their warning; the mysteries whispered to him, but his ears were closed. He searched for no path, and was blind to all the signals. He blundered into the Swamp and floundered toward the knoll as the Spaniards did. He floundered out of the quagmire near where the White Pig lay. He had the scent and all the signs of an alien, and the White Grunter rushed at him with open mouth. The Swamp was now angry from centre to circumference, and poor Chunky Riley\u0027s ending would have been swift and sudden but for the fact that he bore some undeveloped kinship to the elements that surrounded him. As the White Pig rushed forward with open mouth, Chunky Riley caught a vague glimpse of him in the darkness, gave one wild yell, leaped into the air, and came down a-straddle of the Grunter\u0027s back. This was more than the White Pig had bargained for. He answered Riley\u0027s yell with a loud squeal, and went tearing through the swamp to the place where Aaron dwelt. The big owl hooted, Rambler howled, and Jack-o\u0027-the-Lantern threw down his torch and fled. The Swamp that had been angry was amazed and frightened. What demon was this that had seized the White Grunter and was carrying him[50] off? What could the rest hope for if so fierce a creature as the White Pig could be disposed of in this fashion? Even Aaron was alarmed at the uproar, for Chunky Riley continued to yell, and the White Pig kept up its squealing. It was well that the Grunter, when he came to Aaron\u0027s place, ran close enough to a tree to rub Chunky Riley off his back, otherwise there is no telling what would have happened. It was well, too, that Chunky Riley called loudly for Aaron when he fell, otherwise he would have been made mincemeat of; for as soon as the White Pig was relieved of his strange burden, his anger rose fiercer than ever, and he came charging at Chunky Riley, who was lying prone on the ground, too frightened to do anything more than try to run to a tree on all-fours. Aaron spoke sharply to the White Pig. \"Shall I use a club on you, White Grunter? Shall I make bacon of you? You heard him call my name.\" The White Pig paused. His small eyes glittered in the dark, and Chunky Riley heard his tusks grate ominously. He knew the creature was foaming with rage. \"Ooft! Your name, Son of Ben Ali?\" said the White Pig in language that Chunky Riley thought was merely a series of angry grunts and snorts. \"Ooft! I heard him call for Aaron, and how long has it been since I heard you say to the Red Chatterer in the hickory-tree that there were a thousand Aarons, but only one Son of Ben Ali? Ooft-Gooft! Am I a horse to be ridden? Humph! No man could ride me—it is what you call a Thing. Umph! let it ride you and then talk about clubs. Ooft!\" \"Is dat Aaron?\" Chunky Riley ventured to inquire. \"Ef \u0027t is, I wish you\u0027d be good enough ter run dat ar creetur \u0027way fum here, kaze I ain\u0027t got no knack fer bein\u0027 chaw\u0027d up an\u0027 spit out, an\u0027 trompled on, an\u0027 teetotally ruint right \u0027fo\u0027 my own face.\" \"What\u0027s your name?\" inquired Aaron. \"You ought ter know me, but I dunner whedder you does er not. I\u0027m name Riley—dey calls me Chunky Riley fer short.\" Aaron was silent for a moment, as if trying to remember the name. Presently he laughed and said: \"Why, yes; I know you pretty well. Come, we\u0027ll kindle a fire.\" \"No suh—not me! Not less\u0027n you\u0027ll run dat ar wil\u0027 hog off. He mo\u0027 servigrous dan a pant\u0027er. Ef I hadn\u0027t er straddled \u0027im des now he\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 e\u0027t me bodaciously up an\u0027 dey wouldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 been nothin\u0027 lef\u0027 but de buttons on my cloze, an\u0027 nobody in de roun\u0027 worl\u0027 would \u0027a\u0027 know\u0027d dey wuz buttons.\" Aaron laughed while speaking to the White Pig: \"Get to bed, Grunter. It is the Lifter—the man that is as strong in the back as a horse.\" \"Gooft-ooft! Let him ride you out as he rode me in—ooft! He\u0027s no man! Gooft! No bed for me. When a horse is ridden, he must eat, as I\u0027ve heard you say, Son of Ben Ali. Gooft-ooft!\" The White Pig, still grinding his tusks together, turned and trotted off into the darkness, and presently Aaron and Chunky Riley heard him crashing through the canes and reeds. Then Aaron kindled his fire. \"Why did you come?\" inquired the Son of Ben Ali when the two had made themselves comfortable. \"Des ter fetch word dat Marster wuz layin\u0027[53] off ter git atter you wid Simmons\u0027s nigger-dogs \u0027fo\u0027 long.\" \"All the way through the dark for that? When did you come to like me so well?\" \"Oh, \u0027t ain\u0027t \u0027zackly dat,\" replied Chunky Riley frankly. \"I hear um talkin\u0027 \u0027bout it when marster an\u0027 dat ar Mr. Simmons wuz walkin\u0027 out in de hoss lot. I wuz in de corn crib, an\u0027 dey didn\u0027t know it, an\u0027 I des sot dar an\u0027 lis\u0027n at um. An\u0027 den dis mornin\u0027 I seed dat ar little Marse Abercrombie, an\u0027 he say, \u0027Go tell Aaron quick ez you kin.\u0027\" \"The child with the crutches?\" queried Aaron. \"De ve\u0027y same,\" replied Chunky Riley. He paused awhile and then added: \"I\u0027d walk many a long mile fer dat white chil\u0027, day er night, rain er shine.\" He gazed in the flickering fire a long time, waiting for Aaron to make some comment. Hearing none, he finally turned his eyes on his companion. Aaron was looking skyward, where one small star could be seen twinkling through the ascending smoke from the fire, and his lips were moving, though they framed no words that[54] Chunky Riley could hear. Something in the attitude of the Son of Ben Ali disturbed the negro. \"Well, I done what I come ter do,\" he said, making a pretense of stretching himself and yawning, \"an\u0027 I speck I\u0027d better be gwine.\" The Son of Ben Ali still kept his eye fixed on the twinkling star. \"What pesters me,\" Chunky Riley went on, \"is de idee dat dat ar wil\u0027 hog went \u0027zackly de way I got ter go. I don\u0027t want ter hatter ride \u0027im no mo\u0027 less\u0027n I got a saddle an\u0027 bridle.\" \"Come!\" exclaimed Aaron suddenly, \"I\u0027ll go with you. I want to see the Little Master.\" \"De dogs\u0027ll fin\u0027 yo\u0027 track sho, ef dey start out to-morrer,\" suggested Chunky Riley. The only response the Son of Ben Ali made to this suggestion was to say: \"Take the end of my cane in your hand and follow it. We\u0027ll take a short cut.\" Chunky Riley had queer thoughts as he followed his tall conductor, being led as if he were a blind man; but he said nothing. Presently (it seemed but a few minutes to Chunky Riley) they stood on the top of a hill. \"Look yonder!\" said Aaron. Away to the left a red light glimmered faintly. \"What dat?\" asked the superstitious negro. \"The light in the Little Master\u0027s window.\" \"How came it so red, den?\" inquired Chunky Riley. \"Red curtain,\" replied Aaron curtly. \"Well, de Lord he\u0027p us! Is we dat close?\" cried Chunky Riley. \"Your way is there,\" said the Son of Ben Ali; \"this is mine.\" The negro stood watching Aaron until his tall form was lost in the darkness.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2801/77469.html","bookId":550,"book":{"id":550,"title":"Aaron in the Wildwoods","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a large plantation in Middle Georgia a boy who was known as Little Crotchet.
