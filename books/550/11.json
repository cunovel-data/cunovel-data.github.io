{"id":38859,"no":11,"title":"X. CHUNKY RILEY SEES A QUEER SIGHT.","content":"There is no doubt that Mr. Gossett was sincere in what he said to Aaron. There is no doubt that he fully intended to carry out the promises he had made in the hope of inducing the runaway to return home with him. Nor can it be doubted that he had some sort of respect for a slave who, although a fugitive with a reward offered for his capture, was willing to go to the rescue of his owner at a very critical moment. Mr. Gossett was indeed a harsh, hard, calculating man, whose whole mind was bent on accumulating \"prop\u0027ty,\" as he called it, to the end that he might be looked up to as Addison Abercrombie and other planters were. But after all, he was a human being, and he admired strength, courage, audacity, and the suggestion of craftiness that he thought he discovered in Aaron. Moreover, he was not without a lurking fear[186] of the runaway, for, at bottom, Mr. Gossett\u0027s was essentially a weak nature. This weakness constantly displayed itself in his hectoring, blustering, overbearing manner toward those over whom he had any authority. It was natural, therefore, that Mr. Gossett should have a secret dread of Aaron, as well as a lively desire to conciliate him up to a certain point. More than this, Mr. Gossett had been impressed by the neighborhood talk about the queer runaway. As long as such talk was confined to the negroes he paid no attention to it; but when such a sage as Mr. Jonathan Gadsby, a man of large experience and likewise a justice of the peace, was ready to agree to some of the most marvelous tales told about the agencies that Aaron was able to call to his aid, the superstitious fears of Mr. Gossett began to give him an uneasy feeling. The first proposition that Mr. Gadsby laid down was that Aaron was \"not by no means a nigger, as anybody with eyes in their head could see.\" That fact was first to be considered. Admit it, and everything else that was said would follow as a matter of course. Mr. Gadsby\u0027s argument, judicially delivered to whomsoever[187] wanted to hear it, was this: It was plain to be seen that the runaway was no more like a nigger than a donkey is like a race-horse. Now, if he wasn\u0027t a nigger what was he trying to play nigger for? What was he up to? Why couldn\u0027t the track dogs catch him? When some one said Mr. Simmons\u0027s dogs hadn\u0027t tried, Mr. Gadsby would answer that when Mr. Simmons\u0027s dogs did try they\u0027d make a worse muddle of it than ever. Why? Because the runaway had on him the marks of the men that called the elements to help them. Mr. Gadsby knew it, because he had seen their pictures in the books, and the runaway looked just like them. Mr. Gadsby\u0027s memory was exact. The pictures he had seen were in a book called the \"Arabian Nights.\" Mr. Gossett thought of what Mr. Gadsby had said, as he sat with Aaron in the buggy, and cold chills began to creep up his spine. He edged away as far as he could, but Aaron paid no attention to his movement. Once the horse turned its head sidewise and whinnied. Aaron made some sort of reply that was unintelligible to Mr. Gossett. The horse stopped still, Aaron jumped from the buggy, went to the animal\u0027s head, and[188] presently came back with a part of the harness in his hand, which he threw on the bottom of the buggy. \"What\u0027s that?\" Mr. Gossett asked. \"Bridle. Bit hurt horse\u0027s mouth.\" He then coolly pulled the reins in and placed them with the bridle. \"Why, confound it, don\u0027t you know this horse is as wild as a buck? Are you fixing to have me killed? What are you doing now?\" Aaron had taken the whip from its thimble, laid the lash gently on the horse\u0027s back, and held it there. In response to his chirrup the horse whinnied gratefully and shook its head playfully. When Mr. Gossett saw that the horse was going easily and that it seemed to be completely under Aaron\u0027s control, he remembered again what Mr. Gadsby had said about people who were able to call the elements to their aid, and it caused a big lump to rise in his throat. What was this going on right before his eyes? A runaway sitting by his side and driving a fractious and easily frightened horse without bit or bridle? And then another thought crossed Mr. Gossett\u0027s mind—a thought so direful that it caused a cold sweat to stand on his forehead. Was it the runaway\u0027s intention to jump suddenly from the buggy and strike the horse with the whip? But Aaron showed no such purpose or desire. Once he leaned forward, peering into the darkness, and said something to the horse. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2801/77477.html","bookId":550,"book":{"id":550,"title":"Aaron in the Wildwoods","description":"简介： Once upon a time there lived on a large plantation in Middle Georgia a boy who was known as Little Crotchet.
