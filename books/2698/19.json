There\u0027s still the matter of your father.\"\\n\\n He had chosen to stay over at the saloon. People still weren\u0027t sure what to make of him, most of them settling on the story that he had been buried alive, then escaped and hidden out, fighting the vampires in secret.\\n\\n \"What about my father? You saw what he did. You know he\u0027s not a threat.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I learned something from him. A vampire can fight evil.\"\\n\\n \"Just like you\u0027ve been doing all these years?\"\\n\\n \"But I\u0027m half human.\"\\n\\n \"Very human,\" she said huskily. \"So what about my father?\" she asked again.\\n\\n Cody pulled her into his arms. \"He wanted to know my intentions.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she murmured. \"And...?\"\\n\\n \"...And I found myself telling him how I felt about you.\"\\n\\n \"What happened then?\"\\n\\n \"Then he mentioned that an Episcopal priest was living in the house.\"\\n\\n She pressed a finger to his lips and told him earnestly. \"I told you that I...that I would settle for whatever we could have.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but I want more,\" he told her, pressing his lips to hers, his kiss both tender and urgent.\\n\\n Then he pulled back and looked down at her again, his eyes glowing golden in the night.\\n\\n \"So much more,\" he said, his tone husky.\\n\\n \"I...I admit I\u0027m more than a little in love with you,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Really? I hadn\u0027t anticipated such a surprising and amazing complication. You see, Miss Alexandra Gordon, I believe that I\u0027m much more than a little in love with you.\"\\n\\n \"But...I know you want to find your father,\" she said.\\n\\n \"True, but...\"\\n\\n \"But?\"\\n\\n \"Every man needs a home base. And if he happens to be a vampire hunter, he could have no better wife than one who knows...all there is to know. The truth about that man.\"\\n\\n She gripped his shoulders and rose on her toes to kiss him.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t actually pose the question,\" she whispered to him. \"But the answer is yes.\"\\n\\n He laughed and swung her up into his arms. In seconds they were tangled together, passionate and laughing, both question and answer spoken in the oldest language known between a man and a woman. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-of-the-wolves-vampire-hunters-1/page-19.html","bookId":2698,"book":{"id":2698,"title":"Night of the Wolves (Vampire Hunters #1)","description":"Storyline: Night of the Wolves (Vampire Hunters #1) \\n Guided by visions as she hunts for her father\u0027s murderer, Alexandra Gordon returns to Victory, Texas--and lands straight in the arms of fearsome lawman Cody Fox. \\n A dedicated soldier in the war against evil, Cody wears his battle scars with honor, all the while hiding a shameful secret from the perceptive Alexandra.
