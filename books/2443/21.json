{"id":79345,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"UNDER ORDERS from Evanna - she threatened to blind and deafen us if we disobeyed - we buried the dead vampaneze and vampet in the copse, digging deep graves and placing them on their backs, facing towards the sky and Paradise, before covering them over.\n Vancha was inconsolable. On our return to the Cirque Du Freak, he demanded a bottle of brandy, then locked himself away in a small trailer and refused to answer our calls. He blamed himself for the escape of the Vampaneze Lord. If he\u0027d tackled his brother, the Vampaneze Lord would have been at our mercy. It was the first of our four promised chances to kill him, and it was hard to imagine a simpler opportunity falling into our laps.\n Mr. Tall already knew what had happened. He\u0027d been expecting the confrontation and told us that the vampaneze had been trailing the Cirque Du Freak for more than a month.\n \"They knew we were coming?\" I asked.\n \"No,\" he said. \"They were following us for other reasons.\"\n \"But you knew we were coming... didn\u0027t you?\" Harkat challenged him.\n Mr. Tall nodded sadly. \"I\u0027d have warned you, but the consequences would have been dire. Those with insight into the future are forbidden to influence it. Only Desmond Tiny, can meddle directly in the affairs of time.\"\n \"Do you know where they have gone,\" Mr. Crepsley asked, \"or when we are due to clash with them again?\"\n \"No,\" Mr. Tall said. \"I could find out, but I read the future as little as possible. What I can tell you is that Gannen Harst is prime protector of the Lord of the Vampaneze. The six you killed were normal guards who can be replaced. Harst is the key guardian. Where the Lord goes, he goes too. Had he been killed, the odds of future success would have weighed heavily on your side.\"\n \"If only I had gone after Harst instead of Vancha,\" Mr. Crepsley sighed.\n Evanna, who\u0027d said nothing since we returned, shook her head. \"Don\u0027t waste time regretting lost chances,\" she said. \"You weren\u0027t destined to face Gannen Harst at this stage of the hunt. Vancha was. It was fate.\"\n \"Let\u0027s be positive,\" I said. \"We now know who the Vampaneze Lord is travelling with. We can spread Gannen Harst\u0027s description and tell our people to look out for him. And they won\u0027t be able to pull that servant disguise again - next time we\u0027ll be ready and know who to look for.\"\n \"This is true,\" Mr. Crepsley agreed. \"Plus we have suffered no losses. We are as strong as we were at the start of our quest, we are wiser, and we still have three chances to kill him.\"\n \"Then why do we feel... so terrible?\" Harkat asked glumly.\n \"Failure is always a bitter pill to swallow,\" Mr. Crepsley said.\n We saw to our wounds after that. Harkat\u0027s arm was badly cut but no bones were broken. We set it in a sling, and Mr. Crepsley said it would be fine in a couple of nights. My right thumb was turning an ugly colour, but Mr. Tall said it wasn\u0027t infected and would be OK if I rested it.\n We were preparing for sleep when we heard angry bellows. Hurrying through the camp - Mr. Crepsley with a heavy cloak tossed over his head to protect him from the morning sun - we found Vancha on the outskirts, tearing off his clothes, an empty bottle of brandy on the ground beside him, screaming at the sun. \"Roast me!\" he challenged it. \"I don\u0027t care! Do your worst! See if I give a-\"\n \"Vancha!\" Mr. Crepsley snapped. \"What are you doing?\"\n Vancha whirled, snatched up the bottle and pointed it at Mr. Crepsley as though it was a knife. \"Stay away!\" he hissed. \"I\u0027ll kill you if you try to stop me!\"\n Mr. Crepsley came to a halt. He knew better than to mess with a drunken vampire, especially one of Vancha\u0027s powers. \"This is stupid, Sire,\" he said. \"Come inside. We will find another bottle of brandy and help you drink-\"\n \"- to the health of the Vampaneze Lord!\" Vancha shrieked crazily.\n \"Sire, this is madness,\" Mr. Crepsley said.\n \"Aye,\" Vancha agreed in a sadder, sober tone. \"But this is a mad world, Larten. Because I spared the life of my brother - who once saved mine - our greatest enemy has escaped and our people face defeat. What sort of a world is it where evil is born of an act of goodness?\"\n Mr. Crepsley had no answer for that.\n \"Dying will not help, Vancha,\" Harkat said. \"I should know.\"\n \"It won\u0027t help,\" Vancha agreed, \"but it will punish, and I deserve to be punished. How could I face my fellow Princes and Generals after this? My chance to kill the Lord of the Vampaneze has passed. Better I pass with it than linger and shame us all.\"\n \"So you plan on staying out here and letting the sun kill you?\" I asked.\n \"Aye,\" he chuckled.\n \"You\u0027re a coward,\" I sneered.\n His expression hardened. \"Take heed, Darren Shan - I\u0027m in the mood to crack a few skulls before I die!\"\n \"And a fool,\" I pressed on, regardless. I stormed past Mr. Crepsley and pointed accusingly at Vancha with my good left hand. \"Who gave you the right to quit? What makes you think you can abandon the quest and damn us all?\"\n \"What are you talking about?\" he stammered, confused. \"I\u0027m no longer part of the quest. It\u0027s up to you and Larten now.\"\n \"Is it?\" Turning, I searched for Evanna and Mr. Tall. I found them together, behind the crowd of circus performers and assistants which had been attracted by the howls of the Prince. \"Lady Evanna. Mr. Tall. Answer if you may - does Vancha still have a part to play in the hunt for the Vampaneze Lord?\"\n Mr. Tall shared an uneasy glance with Evanna. She hesitated, then said grudgingly, \"He has the power to influence the quest.\"\n \"But I failed,\" Vancha said, bewildered.\n \"Once,\" I agreed. \"But who\u0027s to say you won\u0027t have another chance? Nobody said we\u0027d have one chance each. For all we know, all four opportunities are destined to fall to you!\"\n Vancha blinked, and his mouth slowly opened.\n \"Even if the chances are to be shared evenly,\" Mr. Crepsley chipped in, \"there are a further three to go, and Darren and I are only two - therefore one of us must be destined to face the Vampaneze Lord twice if it goes down to the final encounter.\"\n Vancha wavered on his feet, considering our words, then dropped the bottle and stumbled towards me. I caught and steadied him. \"I\u0027ve been an idiot, haven\u0027t I?\" he groaned.\n \"Yes,\" I agreed, smiling, then led him back into the shade, where he joined us in slumber until the darkening of night.\n We arose with the sinking of the sun and gathered in Mr. Tall\u0027s van. As dusk deepened, and Vancha drank mug after mug of steaming hot coffee to cure his hangover, we debated our next move and decided it would be for the best if we left the Cirque Du Freak. I would have liked to stay on longer, and so would Mr. Crepsley, but our destiny lay elsewhere. Besides, Gannen Harst might return with an army of vampaneze, and we didn\u0027t want to find ourselves boxed in, or bring the wrath of our foes down upon the circus folk.\n Evanna would not be travelling with us. The witch told us she was returning to her cave and frogs, to prepare for the tragedies to come. \"And there will be tragedies,\" she said, a sparkle in her brown and green eyes. \"Whether for the vampires or vampaneze, I don\u0027t yet know. But it must end in tears for one set, that much is certain.\"\n I can\u0027t say I missed the short, hairy, ugly witch when she left - her dark predictions had brought nothing but gloom into our lives, and I thought we were better off without her.\n Vancha would also be departing by himself. We\u0027d agreed that he should return to Vampire Mountain and tell the others of our encounter with the Lord of the Vampaneze. They needed to know about Gannen Harst. Vancha would link up with us again later, by tracking Mr. Crepsley\u0027s mental waves.\n We bid short farewells to our friends at the Cirque Du Freak. Evra was sad that I had to leave so soon, but he knew my life was complicated. Shancus was even sadder - it would be his birthday soon and he\u0027d been anticipating a wonderful present. I told the snake-boy I\u0027d find something exciting on the road and send it to him - although I couldn\u0027t guarantee it would reach him in time for his birthday - and that cheered him up.\n Truska asked if I wanted to take my newly tailored pirate costume with me. I told her to hang on to it - it would only get stained and torn during my travels. I swore I\u0027d be back to try it out. She said I\u0027d better, then treated me to a long goodbye kiss which had Vancha seething with jealousy.\n Mr. Tall met us at the edge of camp as we were about to leave. \"Sorry I couldn\u0027t come earlier,\" he said. \"Business to deal with. The show must go on.\"\n \"Take care, Hibernius,\" Mr. Crepsley said, shaking the tall man\u0027s hand. For once Mr. Tall didn\u0027t shirk away from the contact.\n \"You too, Larten,\" he replied, a grave expression on his face. Looking around at us, he said, \"Dark times lie ahead, regardless of the outcome of your quest. I want you to know that there will always be a home for you - all of you - here at the Cirque Du Freak. I can\u0027t play as active a part in the deciding of the future as I wish, but I can offer sanctuary.\"\n We thanked him for his offer, then watched as he walked away and was swallowed by the shadows of his beloved circus camp.\n Facing each other, we hesitated, reluctant to part.\n \"Well!\" Vancha boomed eventually. \"Time I was off. It\u0027s a long trek to Vampire Mountain, even when flitting.\" Vampires weren\u0027t supposed to flit on the way to the mountain fortress, but the rules had been relaxed during wartime to allow for quicker communication between Generals and Princes.\n Each of us shook Vancha\u0027s hand. I felt miserable at the thought of parting with the red-skinned, sun-fighting Prince. \"Cheer up,\" he laughed at my gloomy expression. \"I\u0027ll be back in time to lead the second charge against the Vampaneze Lord. You have my word, and Vancha March never broke...\" He paused. \"\u0027March\u0027 or \u0027Harst\u0027?\" he mused aloud, then spat into the dirt at his feet. \"Charna\u0027s guts! I\u0027ve gone this long as Vancha March - I\u0027ll stick with it.\"\n Saluting, he turned abruptly and jogged away. Soon he was running. Then, in a flash, he hit flitting speed and was lost to sight.\n \"And then there were three,\" Mr. Crepsley muttered, gazing at Harkat and me.\n \"Back where we started six years ago,\" I said.\n \"But we had a destination then,\" Harkat noted. \"Where are we going... this time?\"\n I looked to Mr. Crepsley for an answer.\n He shrugged. \"We can decide later. For now, let us simply walk.\"\n Hoisting our bags on to our backs, we spared the Cirque Du Freak one last, lingering glimpse, then faced the cold, unwelcoming darkness and set forth, surrendering ourselves to the forces of destiny and future terrors of the night. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hunters-of-the-dusk-the-saga-of-darren-shan-7/page-21.html","bookId":2443,"book":{"id":2443,"title":"Hunters of the Dusk (The Saga of Darren Shan #7)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #7: Hunters of the Dusk \n In the seventh book of this series, not long into his years as a Prince, Darren is once again visited by Desmond Tiny (the creator of vampires and Little People).
