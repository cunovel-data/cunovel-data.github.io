{"id":79338,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"EVANNA HAD prepared a feast for us, but it was all vegetables and fruit - she was a vegetarian and wouldn\u0027t allow anyone to eat meat in her cave. Vancha teased her about it - \"Still on the cow-food, Lady?\" - but ate his share along with Harkat and me, though he only chose food which hadn\u0027t been cooked.\\n\\n \"How can you eat that?\" I asked, revolted, as he tucked into a raw turnip.\\n\\n \"All in the conditioning,\" he winked, biting deeply into it. \"Yum - a worm!\"\\n\\n Mr. Crepsley joined us as we were finishing. He was in a sombre mood for the rest of the night, saying little, staring off into space.\\n\\n The cave was far more luxurious than the caverns of Vampire Mountain. Evanna had made a real home of it, with soft feather beds, wonderful paintings on the walls and huge candle-lit lamps which cast a rosy glow over everything. There were couches to lie on, fans to cool us, exotic fruit and wine. After so many years of rough living, it seemed like a palace.\\n\\n As we relaxed and digested the meal, Vancha cleared his throat and broached our reason for being here. \"Evanna, we\u0027ve come to discuss-\"\\n\\n She silenced him with a quick wave of a hand. \"We\u0027ll have none of that tonight,\" she insisted. \"Official business can wait until tomorrow. This is a time for friendship and rest.\"\\n\\n \"Very well, Lady. This is your domain and I bow to your wishes.\" Lying back, Vancha burped loudly, then looked for somewhere to spit. Evanna tossed a small silver pot at him. \"Ah!\" he beamed. \"A spittoon.\" He leant over and spat forcefully into it. There was a slight \u0027ping\u0027 and Vancha grunted happily.\\n\\n \"I was cleaning up for days the last time he visited,\" Evanna remarked to Harkat and me, \"Pools of spit everywhere. Hopefully the spittoon will keep him in order. Now if only there was something for him to flick his nose-pickings into...\"\\n\\n \"Are you complaining about me?\" Vancha asked.\\n\\n \"Of course not, Sire,\" she replied sarcastically. \"What woman could object to a man invading her home and covering the floor with mucus?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think of you as a woman, Evanna,\" he laughed.\\n\\n \"Oh?\" There was ice in her tone. \"What do you think of me as?\"\\n\\n \"A witch,\" he said innocently, then leapt from the couch and raced out of the cave before she cast a spell on him.\\n\\n Later, when Evanna had regained her sense of humour, Vancha snuck back in to his couch, fluffed up a cushion, stretched out and chewed at a wart on his left palm.\\n\\n \"I thought you only slept on the floor,\" I remarked.\\n\\n \"Ordinarily,\" he agreed, \"but it\u0027d be impolite to refuse another\u0027s hospitality, especially when your host is the Lady of the Wilds.\"\\n\\n I sat up curiously. \"Why do you call her a Lady? Is she a princess?\"\\n\\n Vancha\u0027s laughter echoed through the cave. \"Do you hear that, Lady? The boy thinks you\u0027re a princess!\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s so strange about that?\" she asked, stroking her moustache. \"Don\u0027t all princesses look like this?\"\\n\\n \"Beneath Paradise, perhaps,\" Vancha chuckled. Vampires believe that the souls of good vampires go beyond the stars to Paradise when they die. There isn\u0027t such a thing as hell in vampire mythology - most believe the souls of bad vampires stay trapped on Earth - but occasionally one would refer to a \u0027beneath Paradise\u0027.\\n\\n \"No,\" Vancha said seriously. \"Evanna\u0027s far more important and regal than any mere princess.\"\\n\\n \"Why, Vancha,\" she cooed, \"that was almost flattering.\"\\n\\n \"I can flatter when I want,\" he said, then broke wind loudly. \"And flutter too!\"\\n\\n \"Disgusting,\" Evanna sneered, but she had a hard time hiding a smile.\\n\\n \"Darren was asking about you on the way here,\" Vancha said to Evanna. \"We told him nothing of your past. Would you care to fill him in?\"\\n\\n Evanna shook her head. \"You tell it, Vancha. I\u0027m not in the mood for story-telling. But keep it short,\" she added, as he opened his mouth to begin.\\n\\n \"I will,\" he promised.\\n\\n \"And don\u0027t be rude.\"\\n\\n \"Lady Evanna!\" he gasped. \"Am I ever?\" Grinning, he ran a hand through his green hair, thought a while, then began in a soft voice which I hadn\u0027t heard him use before. \"Heed, children,\" he said, then cocked an eyebrow and said in his own voice, \"That\u0027s the way to begin a story. Humans start with \u0027Once upon a time\u0027, but what do humans know about-\"\\n\\n \"Vancha,\" Evanna interrupted. \"I said keep it short.\"\\n\\n Vancha grimaced, then started over, again in his soft voice. \"Heed, children - we creatures of the night were not made to beget heirs. Our women can\u0027t give birth and our men can\u0027t sire children. This is the way it\u0027s been since the first vampire walked by the light of the moon, and the way we thought it would always be.\\n\\n \"But seventeen hundred years ago, there lived a vampire by the name of Corza Jarn. He was ordinary in all respects, making his way in the world, until he fell in love and mated with a vampiress called Sarfa Grail. They were happy, hunting and fighting side by side, and when the first term of their mating agreement elapsed, they agreed to mate again.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s how vampire \u0027marriages\u0027 work. Vampires don\u0027t agree to stay with one another for life, only for ten, fifteen or twenty years. Once that time is up, they can agree to another decade or two together, or go their separate ways.\\n\\n \"Midway through their second term,\" Vancha continued, \"Corza grew restless. He wished to have a baby with Sarfa and raise a child of his own. He refused to accept then-natural limitations and went looking for the cure to vampire sterility. For decades he searched in vain, the loyal Sarfa by his side. A hundred years came and went. Two hundred. Sarfa died during the quest but this didn\u0027t put Corza off - if anything, it made him search even harder for a solution. Finally, fourteen hundred years ago, his search led him to that meddler with the watch - Desmond Tiny.\\n\\n \"Now,\" Vancha said gruffly, \"it\u0027s not known exactly how much power Mr. Tiny wields over vampires. Some say he created us, others that he once was one of us, others still that he\u0027s simply an interested observer. Corza Jarn knew no more about Tiny\u0027s true self than the rest, but he believed the magician could help, and followed him around the world, begging him to put an end to the barren curse of the vampire clan.\\n\\n \"For two centuries Mr. Tiny laughed at Corza Jarn and waved his pleas away. He told the vampire - now old and feeble, close to death - to stop worrying. He said children weren\u0027t meant for vampires. Corza wouldn\u0027t accept this. He pestered Tiny and begged him to give the vampires hope. He offered his soul in exchange for a solution, but Mr. Tiny sneered and said if he wanted Corza\u0027s soul, he would simply take it.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t heard that part of the story before,\" Evanna cut in.\\n\\n Vancha shrugged. \"Legends are flexible. I think it\u0027s good to remind people of Tiny\u0027s cruel nature, so I do, every chance I get.\\n\\n \"Eventually,\" he returned to the story, \"for reasons of his own, Tiny relented. He said he\u0027d create a woman capable of bearing a vampire\u0027s child, but added a catch - the woman and her children would either make the clan more powerful than ever... or destroy us completely!\\n\\n \"Corza was troubled by Tiny\u0027s words, but he\u0027d sought too long and hard to be dissuaded by the threat. He agreed to Tiny\u0027s terms, and let him take some of his blood. Tiny mixed Corza\u0027s blood with that of a pregnant wolf and worked strange charms on her. The wolf gave birth to four cubs. Two were stillborn and normal in shape, but the others were alive - and human in appearance! One was a boy, the other a girl!\"\\n\\n Vancha paused and looked at Evanna. Harkat and me looked too, our eyes wide. The witch grimaced, then stood and took a bow. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I was that hairy little she-cub.\"\\n\\n \"The children grew quickly,\" Vancha went on. \"Within a year they were adults and left their mother and Corza, to seek out their destiny in the wilds. The boy went first, without saying anything, and nobody knows what became of him.\\n\\n \"Before the girl left, she gave Corza a message to take to the clan. He was to tell them what had happened, and say that she took her duties very seriously. He was also to tell them that she was not ready for motherhood, and that no vampire should seek her out as a mate. She said there was much she had to consider, and it would be centuries - perhaps longer - before she made her choice.\\n\\n \"That was the last any vampire saw of her for four hundred years.\"\\n\\n He stopped, looked thoughtful for a moment, then picked up a banana and began to eat it, skin and all. \"The end,\" he mumbled.\\n\\n \"The end?\" I shouted. \"It can\u0027t end there! What happened next? What did she do for those four centuries? Did she choose a mate when she came back?\"\\n\\n \"She chose no mate,\" Vancha said. \"Still hasn\u0027t. As for what she got up to...\" He smiled. \"Maybe you should ask her yourselves.\"\\n\\n Harkat and me turned to Evanna. \"Well?\" we asked together.\\n\\n Evanna pursed her lips. \"I chose a name,\" she said.\\n\\n I laughed. \"You can\u0027t have spent four hundred years picking a name!\"\\n\\n \"That wasn\u0027t all I got up to,\" she agreed, \"but I devoted much of that time to the choice. Names are vital to beings of destiny. I have a role to play in the future, not just of the vampire clan, but of every creature in the world. The name I chose would have a bearing on that role. I settled in the end for Evanna.\" She paused. \"I think it was a good choice.\"\\n\\n Rising, Evanna croaked something at her frogs, who set off for the mouth of the cave. \"I must go,\" she said. \"We have spoken enough of the past. I will be absent most of the day. When I return, we shall discuss your quest and the part I am to take in it.\" She departed after the frogs, and moments later had disappeared into the ripening rays of the dawn.\\n\\n Harkat and me stared after her. Then Harkat asked Vancha if the legend he\u0027d told was true. \"As true as any legend can be,\" Vancha replied cheerfully.\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\" Harkat asked.\\n\\n \"Legends change in the telling,\" Vancha said. \"Seventeen hundred years is a long time, even by vampire standards. Did Corza Jam really drag around the world after Desmond Tiny? Did that agent of chaos agree to help? Could Evanna and the boy have been born of a she-wolf?\" He scratched an armpit, sniffed his fingers and sighed. \"Only three people in the world know the truth - Desmond Tiny, the boy - if he still lives - and Lady Evanna.\"\\n\\n \"Have you ever asked Evanna if it\u0027s true?\" Harkat enquired.\\n\\n Vancha shook his head. \"I\u0027ve always preferred a stirring good legend to boring old facts.\" With that, the Prince rolled over and dropped off to sleep, leaving Harkat and me to discuss the story quietly and wonder. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hunters-of-the-dusk-the-saga-of-darren-shan-7/page-14.html","bookId":2443,"book":{"id":2443,"title":"Hunters of the Dusk (The Saga of Darren Shan #7)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #7: Hunters of the Dusk \\n In the seventh book of this series, not long into his years as a Prince, Darren is once again visited by Desmond Tiny (the creator of vampires and Little People).
