{"id":87802,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"I pondered her words that night, coming to the conclusion that maybe Santa was Satan after all since their names had the same letters. As a matter of fact, I was so convinced that the next morning before school I scrawled Santa\u003dSatan on twenty-six slips of paper, one for each of the students in my class, and one for Ms. Price, my kindergarten teacher, in case she hadn\u0027t been let in on the secret like me. Those twenty-six slips of paper earned me a one-way ticket to the office that day. When Donna picked me up from the principal\u0027s office, she almost looked proud of me. Almost. Convinced I had found what would finally make a space for me in her life, I decided to set the record straight on the whole Santa conspiracy. I was back in the office the next day when I bloodied Brad Mitchell\u0027s nose after he informed me I was \"stupid and ugly\" for believing Santa was evil. Donna didn\u0027t look quite as pleased this time when she picked me up, especially after the principal told her I would be suspended for the day if I didn\u0027t let the subject drop. During the car ride home, Donna lectured me about how Santa wasn\u0027t Satan because he wasn\u0027t real. I was sent to bed without dinner that night to reflect on keeping my hands to myself in the future, but instead I plotted my revenge on Brad and the other kids who had laughed at me. The next morning, Brad pulled his spelling workbook out of his desk and I almost died laughing when he fell out of his chair from a squirming mass of worms that landed in his lap. The worms were courtesy of my dad, though their actual purpose was supposed to be for his upcoming annual fishing weekend. My punishment was doubled for that prank, but it didn\u0027t deter me as I spent the rest of kindergarten exacting my revenge. I didn\u0027t mind the punishments since Donna was forced to pick me up each time. She\u0027d spend the drive lecturing me on my \"atrocious\" behavior. I\u0027d tune out the actual words, just pleased that she was actually talking to me. Eventually though, she stopped lecturing and the drives were filled with angry tense silences until finally, I lost interest and stopped. Not wanting to think about the past anymore, I walked over to my stereo and docked my iPod. I selected the rock playlist and blasted the volume. The steady beat of the music throbbed through my room, drowning out the bothersome memories. I selected a book off my bookshelf and plopped down on my bed. I didn\u0027t open the book though. Instead, I allowed the events of the day to run through my mind like a filmstrip. Mitch\u0027s death played havoc with my mind as I morbidly wondered how he\u0027d done it. I\u0027d given suicide so much thought that I was convinced that an overdose was the only way to go. Donna would have had a fit if I would have made it messy, and I figured a clean death could be my last parting gift to her. Maybe then she\u0027d finally forgive me for all my past sins. For a while, I\u0027d entertained thoughts of doing it on the awful floral print sofa in the front room which would have been the ultimate exclamation point. Suddenly, it occurred to me that all my thoughts seemed to focus on how I would have done it, not how I was going to do it. The oddity of my thoughts truly puzzled me as I lied there contemplating it all. Strangely enough, what I think I felt was relief, but how is that possible? I was pissed this morning when Mitch ruined my plans, and now I\u0027m relieved? Did that mean I never would have gone through with it? I was just a hack the whole time. A fraud. Chapter Five The next morning I still felt like a fraud. My epiphany didn\u0027t suddenly change my life so that now there would be birds chirping happily outside my window. The sun beams didn\u0027t beckon me to dance beneath them, and it certainly didn\u0027t change the limited greeting Donna gave me as I entered the kitchen and grabbed my typical breakfast from the refrigerator. I returned her greeting with Coke in hand before sliding in my earbuds. The music drowned out all other noise, but I knew from past experience Donna had nothing else to say. I gathered up my backpack while Donna tossed away her empty yogurt container and placed her spoon in the dishwasher. We left the house together without a word and within a few minutes she pulled up in front of my school. \"Bye,\" I said, stowing my earbuds and iPod in my backpack as I climbed out of the car. \"Bye,\" she replied, picking up her phone as I closed the door. I watched her talking on the phone as she drove away. If I cared, I would have wondered who she talked to when she wasn\u0027t with me. I would have wondered if she ever laughed or even smiled at a witty comment, but I didn\u0027t care, so I didn\u0027t wonder. First period was filled with note taking while we watched a movie on the reconstruction of Europe\u0027s ravaged cities after World War II. I doodled on my page, listening with half an ear. It wasn\u0027t just me. Most of the class whispered and texted each other throughout the movie. Mitch wasn\u0027t mentioned in the whispers, and no one uttered the word suicide the entire period. I wasn\u0027t surprised. People were fickle and attention spans were short. Today\u0027s juicy nugget was how some junior named Pam had gone down on two jocks behind the bleachers in the gym. Gossip was a weird beast. Everyone always scoffed at being labeled a \"gossip,\" but they had no qualms about passing damaging information along, which is the ironic part. All the whispering, glaring, pointing and judging makes them no better than whoever or whatever it is they\u0027re gossiping about. Before I put my foot down and stopped going to church, I\u0027d seen gossip rear its ugly head many times. Religious people were big on saying the \"tongue is a mighty weapon, so use it wisely,\" and then forsaking this claim when the music director slept with the minister\u0027s wife or when the youth minister did what he did. The plain and simple fact was everyone sinned. Either they were good at hiding their sins, or they weren\u0027t. I fell in the latter category. My sins had been featured front and center, on display for everyone to judge. The rest of the morning passed much like first period had. No \"Mitch\" mentions, but tons of how wide Pam\u0027s mouth is. James was waiting for me outside the cafeteria when I joined him. \"Hey,\" I said, munching on the barbecue chips I\u0027d bought from the vending machine. \"Hey,\" he said in a lackluster voice. \"Same old crap?\" I asked, not needing to clarify. \"Yeah,\" he said, pulling up his sleeve to reveal a bruise in the shape of a handprint circling his wrist. \"Bastard.\" He nodded, accepting the only form of sympathy I knew how to give. \"Just till grad,\" I said, attempting to be reassuring. \"I guess,\" he answered, pulling the sleeve of his hoodie back down to cover the mark. He stared off at nothing, lost in thought. \"You want to hang out after I get out of tutoring?\" \"I thought that was a one-day thing?\" \"Nah, Whore Cat is making me do it all week,\" I lied. \"Oh,\" he said, still distracted. \"I can\u0027t come over anyway.\" \"You sure?\" I asked. \"Too big of a risk. It\u0027s better if I just go home.\" I didn\u0027t pry. I knew from personal experience that the last thing he needed was me nosing into his business. We spent the rest of lunch in silence. After awhile, he seemed to relax a little, and his shoulders didn\u0027t droop quite as much. Like I said, we were silent comforters. \"See you tomorrow,\" I said, slinging my backpack over my shoulder. \"See ya,\" he said, heading toward the science building. My afternoon classes dragged after lunch, and I found myself watching the clock more than normal. It loathed me to admit that I was excited about tutoring. It was like someone had granted me an hour in Willy Wonka\u0027s Chocolate factory. It was wrong to think of it like that, but for the brief hour, I was allowing my feelings a pardon from the tight lockdown I normally kept them under. For one hour, I was going to let myself talk to someone in something other than one-word answers. For one hour, I was going to enjoy myself. I was going to be normal. Dean was waiting for me at the same table as yesterday, only he was already sitting on the side we had shared. \"Hey, ready for some more World War II?\" he teased. \"Uh, sure,\" I said with a mouth that felt like it was suddenly stuffed with peanut butter. I discreetly moved my chair over to put distance between us before sitting down. I pulled out my book and the crumbled study guide. I should have been embarrassed at its wrinkled state, but I kind of enjoyed seeing his reaction. \"Okay, we left off on question twenty-nine,\" he said, smoothing out the paper. I looked down at the table wanting to smile more than I had in years. Something about his expression made me almost happy, and his obsessive-compulsive behavior was kind of cute. We spent the first half an hour of tutoring much like the previous day. Dean would read the question in his radio voice, and then provide the correct answer while I jotted it down. I never enjoyed schoolwork like I did at the moment. Maybe that\u0027s where the school system had effed up. They should have hired radio personalities to teach the classes. Grades were bound to skyrocket. \"So, what college are you going to?\" Dean asked out of the blue after asking me which city suffered the most devastation after the war. \"What?\" I asked confused, forgetting the answer I was jotting down. \"Got a college picked?\" he repeated. \"No,\" I answered shortly, looking back at the textbook for the right answer. \"\u0027No,\u0027 you haven\u0027t picked one, or \u0027no,\u0027 you don\u0027t know where you want to go?\" he asked, pointing at the answer in the book. \"No, as in no college in their right mind would be interested in a student like me,\" I said. \"Sure they would,\" he said, looking at me with an intensity that made me uncomfortable. \"It\u0027s not like I have any interest in going to college anyway,\" I said sarcastically, pulling my shield firmly in place. \"I\u0027d help you. You know, tutoring and helping you study for exams.\" \"What is this, save-a-loser day?\" I asked, making it clear I wanted the conversation to be over. \"You\u0027re not a loser,\" he said, looking like I had offended him somehow. Someone at a nearby table shushed him. \"I am, and guess what? I don\u0027t give a shit. Got me? I\u0027m a nobody. You don\u0027t need to save me. No one does,\" I said. My tone took the wind out of his anger. \"I can help you,\" he repeated calmly. \"Look, scholar boy, I don\u0027t need your help. I just don\u0027t care about this stuff. Don\u0027t take it personally.\" \"Why?\" he asked, looking down at the book. \"Why, what?\" I asked, trying to cover my impatient sigh. \"Why don\u0027t you care?\" I eyed him, wondering if he was yanking my chain. \"Seriously, either you\u0027re trying to be an ass or you\u0027re dumb as one,\" I said, tapping my pencil on the table in aggravation that we were even having this conversation. He raised his eyebrows at me before answering in short drawn out words. \"I. Want. To. Help. You. Got me?\" \"Do I have \u0027charity case\u0027 stamped on my forehead? Or wait, are you trying to punk me? Because seriously, I\u0027ve seen all the movies. Pretend to befriend a social outcast and then just when she starts to trust you, throw pig\u0027s blood or something equally as macabre on her in front of all your cronies. I\u0027m not a fool,\" I said, dismissing him as I jotted down the next answer on my worksheet. He remained silent, and after a moment, I couldn\u0027t resist chancing a discreet look at him beneath the veil of my hair. His eyes clashed with mine, and I swallowed the sudden uncomfortable lump in my throat from the hurt look on his face. I actually felt a little guilty which was a shock. I didn\u0027t do guilt anymore. I may pay the price for my sins for the rest of my life, but I\u0027d vowed I\u0027d no longer get trapped into feeling guilty. I didn\u0027t ask for anything. I didn\u0027t owe anyone anything. Anger replaced the guilt that was making me feel emotions that were dead to me. Damn him. Why couldn\u0027t he take pity on some stray animal or something? Wasn\u0027t there a whale to save or some dolphin with a broken fin that needed attention? The silence between us stretched on uncomfortably, and I tried to ignore it as I continued to scratch the answers out on my paper. I waited for him to move on to the next question, but he remained stoically silent with his arms crossed over his chest. I knew this game. He could sit there like that until hell froze over for all I cared. I would not cave. And that\u0027s pretty much how the rest of tutoring went. I searched for the answers while he sat silently next to me, never moving a muscle. When the hour ended, I stood up and gathered my things, preparing to leave without a word. \"Same time tomorrow?\" he said, leaving before I could. I stood there shell shocked. He didn\u0027t really think I was coming back again? I\u0027d pretty much chalked up the whole experience as a failed attempt at being normal. Dean was long gone by the time I finally shook myself out of my stupor and headed out of the library with the clearly aggravated librarian on my heals. I was tempted to tell her to get a grip. So she had to stay five extra minutes while I stood like a guppy with my mouth open. You didn\u0027t see me bitching that I was forced to stay late at the bane of my existence. Shit happens. Get used to it. I wasn\u0027t surprised when she left me on the sidewalk outside the front doors of the school without a word, hurrying off toward the lone car in the parking lot. People didn\u0027t enjoy being sucked into the shadows that were my constant companion. They wanted perky, cheerful and butterflies out the ass as they danced beneath rainbows and singing birds. They didn\u0027t want silence and darkness. The two-mile walk home went fast as I contemplated the disastrous tutoring session. I mentally kicked myself for even saying anything. I\u0027d broken my code by opening my mouth. One thing was for sure, he could wait all afternoon for me, but I wouldn\u0027t be there the next day. No way in hell. He was waiting for me the next day when I strolled in five minutes late. I wasn\u0027t going to come. All day I told myself I was going to leave him high and dry. I didn\u0027t need his psycho-analysis shit. I\u0027d been heading out of the locker room, intending to head right home, but my feet seemed to have a mind of their own, and here I was. I convinced myself it was because we had unfinished business. My plan was to basically tell him to eff-off and then I\u0027d leave. Quick and clean. No harm no foul. My eff-off moment never came though because he threw me for a loop. \"Hey, I\u0027m really sorry about yesterday. I know I came across as do-gooder-asshole,\" he greeted me, raking a hand through his short dark hair. It stood up slightly from his touch, giving him a rumpled just-woke-up look. \"I can be pushy sometimes. Forgive me?\" he said, holding his hand out for me to shake.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/miss-me-not/page-4.html","bookId":2782,"book":{"id":2782,"title":"Miss Me Not","description":"Storyline: Miss Me Not is a beautiful story of self-discovery, forgiveness, caring, and love.
