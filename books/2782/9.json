{"id":87807,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\\n\\n Chapter Nine\\n\\n Dean was waiting for me by Ms. Jones\u0027s class when I arrived at school the next morning.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Hey, how was the reunion thingy?\"\\n\\n \"Crazy, hectic, mass chaos, overeating extravaganza. You get the idea,\" he said laughing. \"I think there was close to sixty of us there all together,\" he added, all blas√© like having sixty family members wasn\u0027t a big deal.\\n\\n \"Sixty?\" I gasped.\\n\\n \"Well, not everyone could make it. Usually, there\u0027s closer to ninety of us,\" he boasted.\\n\\n \"Ninety? Is your family part rabbit or something?\"\\n\\n He sniggered. \"Almost. Nah, my grandparents on my dad\u0027s side had six kids, all boys, which translates into a shitload of aunts, uncles, cousins, stepcousins, blah, blah, blah.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s insane,\" I said, trying to wrap my brain around the idea of that much family when mine was barely hanging on by a thread. My grandparents on Donna\u0027s side of the family had died six months apart the year before I was born. Like my dad, Donna had been an only child, which pretty much left me SOL in the relative category. Of course, the fact that Donna wanted to stab my dad\u0027s mom made that relationship all but obsolete. I didn\u0027t care. I was good all alone. Alone was simple. It didn\u0027t require any baggage.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s one way to put it. Next time we get together, I\u0027ll bring you with me.\"\\n\\n \"Right, I\u0027m sure they\u0027d love it if you brought a complete stranger to a family gathering,\" I said sarcastically.\\n\\n \"Are you kidding? My papaw is old school. His theory is pretty much \u0027the more the merrier.\u0027 Someone always brings a friend. So see, it\u0027s all set. Next time you\u0027ll get to see the crazy, hectic, mass chaos, overeating extravaganza firsthand.\"\\n\\n \"Uh, sure, maybe,\" I answered vaguely. The chances we\u0027d still be friends by his next family reunion were slim to none anyway.\\n\\n \"Sweet, I better head to class,\" he said, checking the time on his phone. \"Meet me at our tree for lunch.\"\\n\\n The morning passed swiftly as I mulled over his demand. I should have been pissed that he didn\u0027t give me a chance to argue. I\u0027d be damned if I let some guy boss me around. If I wanted to eat lunch with him it\u0027d be my decision, not because he all but demanded my attendance. I was pissed. Well, sort of. I\u0027d meet him at our tree because the idea of having lunch in such a magical place appealed to me. Not because he told me to.\\n\\n I ran into James outside my fourth period class. \"Hey, I\u0027m studying in the library during lunch.\" My white lie slipped out on its own accord.\\n\\n \"Really?\" he asked, knowing my aversion to schoolwork.\\n\\n \"Yeah, no reason to give Whore Cat a reason to call Donna,\" I said, looking down. I felt uncomfortable lying to him. I was sure he knew I was hiding something. I hated lying in general, and with him it just felt wrong. He was bound to find out, but at the moment, I just wanted to keep my new friendship private as long as I could. It was silly.\\n\\n \"Right,\" he said, not probing. Our friendship was based on secrets we\u0027d never divulge. \"I\u0027ll catch you later.\"\\n\\n \"Truth,\" I said, heading down the opposite way before I could change my mind. Having lunch with James was the safe bet. I knew my existence was safe with him. Dean was a different story. I could already tell he expected more from our friendship than James ever had. He was bound to be disappointed. I disappointed everyone.\\n\\n I headed to the far side of the campus where \"our\" tree was located. The grass beneath the giant tree was empty. I plopped myself down, waiting for Dean to show up. After ten minutes had passed with still no Dean, I finally pulled out the bag of chips I\u0027d bought from the vending machine after second period and began munching them to help calm my stomach that was twisting into tight knots with every second that passed. He wasn\u0027t coming. I wasn\u0027t surprised, I\u0027d been expecting it. Really, I had.\\n\\n With five minutes of lunch to spare, I finally crumpled up my empty chip bag and stood up. No one was around to watch my walk of shame, but the pain was still staggering. I\u0027d gone years closing my emotions off and within a week of meeting Dean I\u0027d become a sniveling idiot. I should be grateful he\u0027d given me the out I\u0027d been looking for. Thanks to his no-show, I could now return back to the life I\u0027d been living before he showed up.\\n\\n My resolve was set. I willed back the emotions bubbling up through my stomach. I was halfway to fifth period when my cell phone chirped in my book bag, but I waited until I sat down in class before checking. Only one person knew my number, so I wasn\u0027t surprised when I saw a text from Dean.\\n\\n Hey sorry I was a no-show. Coach Smith was a complete asshole today. He made the whole basketball team run laps since a couple of guys from the team gave him lip. D\\n\\n What a relief. He didn\u0027t stand me up. His excuse was legitimate. Coach Smith was notorious for his arrogant attitude. He\u0027d played college ball as a third-string player, but liked to make it seem like he played for the NBA. I was lucky enough to escape his narcissism for the last four years, but had heard him plenty of times in the hallways. If bragging was an Olympic sport, he\u0027d have a gold medal.\\n\\n I reread the text one more time, liking the way he ended his message with a simple D, like I wouldn\u0027t know who the message was from. I stowed the phone back in my bag. Texting was still foreign to me, and I was pretty sure it\u0027d take me a half an hour to figure out how to send a simple text. Maybe I\u0027d call him when I got home. Probably not though, reaching out was not my forte.\\n\\n I was almost home when a familiar jeep pulled up beside me. \"Can I give you a ride home?\" Dean asked, leaning over the passenger seat.\\n\\n \"My house is right there,\" I reminded him, pointing down the street at my house.\\n\\n \"I can at least save you a few steps,\" he cajoled me.\\n\\n \"Seriously?\" I asked, raising my eyebrows at him as he pushed the passenger door open.\\n\\n \"Come on, please? I\u0027m bummed we didn\u0027t get to have lunch together.\"\\n\\n \"What? Laps weren\u0027t your idea of a fun lunch?\" I asked, climbing into the front seat.\\n\\n \"Ha, you\u0027re a crack up. I\u0027m thinking of quitting the team. Smith is such a pain.\"\\n\\n \"Really, what will your parents say?\" I asked, wondering about the dynamics of a regular family.\\n\\n \"Oh, they\u0027ll support me. My dad and Coach Smith have gotten into it over the last few years. There\u0027s definitely no love lost between them,\" he said, chuckling as he parked his car in my driveway. \"Besides, it stopped being fun after we left junior high. It\u0027s not like I planned on going pro or anything. Is my jeep okay here?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I answered through a sudden dry mouth. It was obvious he planned on coming inside.\\n\\n \"Figured we could do some studying,\" he said, grabbing my book bag and trailing behind me as I made my way up the walkway.\\n\\n \"No need. Thanks to you, I\u0027m now squeaking out a passing grade in world history. Whore Cat\u0027s happy and off my back, so it\u0027s all good.\"\\n\\n \"Whore Cat?\" he asked, plopping down on the sofa.\\n\\n \"Yeah, kind of a nickname. She\u0027s always nosing into my business like a cat in heat that\u0027s always sniffing all the other cats\u0027 asses.\"\\n\\n He threw his head back laughing at my words. \"You have a point,\" he finally said once he could talk again. \"So what are some of the other teachers\u0027 names?\"\\n\\n \"What makes you think I\u0027ve nicknamed anyone else?\"\\n\\n He raised his eyebrows at me knowingly.\\n\\n \"Okay, maybe I do,\" I finally caved. \"Uh, well, I call Mr. Fick, Fickhead, though it\u0027s not very original. Principal Wilson is Douche Bag, for obvious reasons, Ms. Sommers is Smokefest, since she always seems to be jonesing for her next cigarette and Mr. Perry is PerryPervert, since he\u0027s always messing with his junk when he calls us girls up to his desk to go over a paper or something else asinine.\\n\\n \"Shut up, seriously? I\u0027ve never had him, but that\u0027s just wrong.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s gag-worthy for sure.\"\\n\\n \"Is that it on the teachers\u0027 nicknames?\" he asked, leaning back against the sofa.\\n\\n \"Yeah, pretty much.\"\\n\\n \"What about the students?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"All your names bleed together. For the most part, everyone is just one big blob that I try to avoid.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n I glared at him, hoping he\u0027d get the point that I didn\u0027t like to talk about this crap.\\n\\n He waited for me to answer, unfazed by my death glare.\\n\\n Sighing, I finally answered. \"Look, Jockstrap, I don\u0027t talk about this shit,\" I said, placing him back in his category so he\u0027d know his place.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going to get me to shut up by labeling me,\" he said dryly. \"Friends talk to each other, so spill it.\\n\\n \"Gah, you\u0027re a pain in the ass. I don\u0027t talk about this shit, even with friends,\" I said, emphasizing the word like it had a bitter taste.\\n\\n \"Well, there you go. Maybe that\u0027s your problem. Maybe it\u0027s time you start trusting someone,\" he answered flatly.\\n\\n \"Trust gets you nowhere,\" I said stubbornly.\\n\\n \"When was the last time you trusted someone? Or have you ever trusted anyone?\" he fired back, seeing through me so acutely that panic clawed its way up my throat. How was he able to see through my shield?\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to stop trying to save me Sport-o. Just because you couldn\u0027t save Mitch doesn\u0027t mean you can save every person you meet,\" I said meanly.\\n\\n He flinched at my words. I looked down, trying to convince myself that I was glad. Maybe now he\u0027d back off. I didn\u0027t care that he looked hurt. Well, maybe I did. I knew my words were cruel. Surely he wouldn\u0027t stick around for my verbal barbs. I didn\u0027t apologize though. Instead, I kept my head down, waiting for the inevitable. Several minutes passed and he didn\u0027t move. Finally, no longer able to resist, I looked up through my curtain of hair that obscured my face from view.\\n\\n \"You might as well know, Mads, you\u0027re not going to scare me away. So stop trying.\"\\n\\n \"Why? What is about me that you find so goddamn appealing: my lack of fashion sense, my monk-like behavior or the fact that I\u0027m a social leper? I mean, seriously. I\u0027m a void. When are you going to realize that?\" I asked in a raised voice.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re a void,\" he said quietly.\\n\\n \"Well, then you\u0027re in the minority because everyone else does. They always have and always will.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re wrong. You\u0027re anything but a void.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know me. Being a void is a small price to pay for all the bad things I\u0027ve done.\"\\n\\n \"What bad things?\" he asked, leaning forward on the couch with his hands clasped together in his lap. His whole demeanor suggested interest in every word I uttered. The attention was unlike any I\u0027d ever received and prickles of unease ran up my arms. He was slowly chipping away at the wall that surrounded me. A wall no one had ever bothered to scale before.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve heard them all,\" I finally answered, meeting his eyes.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you tell me your version.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t,\" I whispered.\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because, I don\u0027t talk about my past. Ever.\"\\n\\n He sat back slowly on Donna\u0027s awful couch and stared at me intently for a moment. \"Okay, fair enough. Let\u0027s study instead,\" he said, patting the spot next to him.\\n\\n \"Gah, studying sucks ass,\" I griped as a ploy while I worked to control the emotions raging a silent battle inside me.\\n\\n \"Nice try. I could tell last week during tutoring that you\u0027re a lot smarter than you let on, so no excuses. I need to study anyway.\"\\n\\n \"So, study at home then,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I want to study with you, although the quietness of your house is a little unnerving. I\u0027m used to chaos, courtesy of the Terrible Two.\"\\n\\n \"Terrible Two?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"My twin sisters. They\u0027re three and holy terrors,\" he said with obvious affection.\\n\\n \"Twins?\" I asked enviously. I would have loved one sibling, but two would have been amazing.\\n\\n \"Yeah, the beauty of fertility drugs, which my parents thought I needed to know at the tender age of thirteen. Believe me, no thirteen-year-old boy wants to hear about fertility drugs, let alone his parents\u0027 sex life. They\u0027re lucky I didn\u0027t need counseling.\"\\n\\n The corners of my mouth twitched, pulling up slightly at each side. Dean\u0027s open attitude was unlike anybody I\u0027d ever met. I couldn\u0027t help responding. Thankfully, he was looking down at his backpack and missed my lapse.\\n\\n \"What time do your parents get home?\" he asked conversationally as he pulled out a chemistry textbook.\\n\\n \"Why?\" I asked sharply, suddenly aware of how alone we were. Maybe he was hoping to score as payment for paying attention to me. I knew girls put out for a whole lot less, so I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised.\\n\\n \"I need to know if my jeep is in the way,\" he said, looking puzzled at my sharp tone.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I said feeling like a complete dip. \"My parents are separated, and you\u0027ll be long gone by the time Donna gets home.\"\\n\\n \"Donna? You call your mom by her first name?\"\\n\\n \"Uh, yeah, it was a sort of a compromise we made when I was thirteen.\"\\n\\n \"Does she always work such late hours?\"\\n\\n \"She goes right to church from work every day,\" I said, reaching for my phone. \"You want a snack? I can order a pizza,\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Sure. I\u0027m a guy, I\u0027m always hungry,\" he said, patting his flat stomach.\\n\\n I nodded like I knew all about the appetites of the opposite sex, when in actuality I didn\u0027t have a clue. My dad had been a stranger before he ever moved out. All my other experiences with the opposite sex hadn\u0027t involved food.\\n\\n Pulling my thought away from the road I didn\u0027t want to travel down, I dialed Al\u0027s Pizza Palazooa.\\n\\n \"Al\u0027s Pizza,\" a familiar voice answered.\\n\\n \"Hey Al, can I get a large pepperoni?\"\\n\\n \"Sure thing, Madison. Chuck just walked in, so your order will be the next to go out. Do you need me to send a couple cans of Coke?\"\\n\\n \"No, I have some. Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"No problem, sugar.\"\\n\\n \"Family?\" Dean asked when I hung up the phone.\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027ve just been a loyal customer. I order from Al\u0027s a lot.\"\\n\\n \"So your mom really goes to church every night? That\u0027s effed up,\" he said, sitting on the floor in front of the coffee table.\\n\\n Foreign laughter bubbled up in my throat and erupted before I could cap it off. Hearing someone else justifying my feelings about Donna\u0027s obsession with her church was gratifying. I clamped a hand over my mouth to cut off my laughter. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/miss-me-not/page-9.html","bookId":2782,"book":{"id":2782,"title":"Miss Me Not","description":"Storyline: Miss Me Not is a beautiful story of self-discovery, forgiveness, caring, and love. \\n Madison Hanson\u0027s past demons have given her a shadow of an existence with little hope.
