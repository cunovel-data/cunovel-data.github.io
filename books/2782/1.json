{"id":87799,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Chapter One\n Mitch Johnson died last night.\n He killed himself. I wasn\u0027t sad or heartbroken when I heard. I was pissed. Stark raving pissed. I didn\u0027t know Mitch well. He was like me, a shadow that floated down the hallways, unnoticed and seemingly nonexistent among the crowd. I knew my attitude seemed callous, but I didn\u0027t care. Mitch stole my thunder.\n It should have been me.\n Mr. Wilson, our douche bag principal, decided to inform us of Mitch\u0027s death between news of an upcoming carwash fundraiser and a threat to crack down on student littering. How he had reached the conclusion that this was the best spot for an announcement like this was beyond me. I was doodling in the margins of my World History book, trying to ignore the annoying squawk of the intercom, and the droning voice of Mr. Wilson, when he suddenly slid Mitch\u0027s suicide in so quickly that I was momentarily confused by the words. I wasn\u0027t even sure I\u0027d heard him right until the entire female population of the class gasped at once. The rest of the announcements were quickly drowned out by an eruption of chatter throughout the room. It was glaringly obvious the news had just added excitement to a drab Tuesday morning. The reactions ran the gambit from feigned grief to jokes about how Mitch may have \"offed himself.\"\n As for me, I was pissed and confused. Why do it on a Monday night? There was nothing significant about a Monday. My friend James, aka \"suicide buddy,\" and I had given the subject a great deal of thought, and had decided that a Thursday was the best day. If you did it on the weekend, it would add drama to everyone\u0027s Monday, giving them nonstop gossip for the entire week. Tuesday held the same risk. Wednesday was a little more desirable, but Thursday was ideal. The student body wouldn\u0027t find out until Friday morning, and most of them would be too hyped up for the upcoming weekend to give a shit about the demise of a fellow student they never cared about in the first place.\n The squawking of the intercom cut off abruptly and was replaced by sobbing. I twisted around incredulously, searching for the person who Mitch had meant enough to that they\u0027d break down in class. What I saw was disgusting. It wasn\u0027t one individual, but three. \"The three clones,\" as I liked to call them. Every school had their prestigious groups. They were the cheerleaders, the jocks and the charismatic kids everyone wanted to be. One of the criers was on our Squadets Team which was our school\u0027s version of a pep squad. The student body got the privilege of watching the Squadet team shake their asses during pep rallies and any other event the school felt was ass-shaking worthy. Of course, now the normally perky, I-wish-it-was-legal-to-stab-them popular bunches were sobbing on each other\u0027s shoulders as if they had just heard that The Vampire Diaries had been cancelled. What a bunch of phony assholes. Go figure they would use this opportunity to steal attention for themselves.\n I bet if asked at gunpoint they wouldn\u0027t have been able to tell you what Mitch looked like, what kind of clothes he wore, what types of music he listened to—nothing. Not that I knew anything about him either, but you didn\u0027t see me with false tears running down my cheeks. Their over-the-top performance hit me hard and heavy, leaving me gasping for my own breath. Never in any of my contemplations about how I\u0027d go about ending my own worthless existence did I ever consider my passing being a bonding moment for those who would step over anyone and everyone. I had expected gossip and speculation and the clucking of ignorant tongues, but not this crap.\n It was like a slap in the face. Ms. Jones handed out tissues to the sobbing girls and offered to send them to the counselors. All three gathered their belongings, excited at the idea of attending something as soul-searching as grief counseling. Once they made their grand exit, Ms. Jones closed up her lesson plan book.\n \"Does anyone else need to see the counselors?\" she asked compassionately, sitting on the edge of her desk and swinging her feet lightly.\n Of all my teachers, Ms. Jones was my least favorite. She was young, which equaled \"still gave a shit\" in teacher code. She was fresh out of school and convinced she could change the world. Five years from now she\u0027d be jaded, bitching about us students to her peers any chance she got. I disliked her because she was convinced she could save me.\n If I had a sense of humor, I would have laughed. Save me from what? Perhaps from my parents who forgot they\u0027d had a daughter almost from the moment I was born, or maybe from the students who whispered behind their hands about me, or maybe she thought she could save me from myself. All were laughable if I had a sense of humor, but I didn\u0027t, so it wasn\u0027t.\n No one responded to Ms. Jones\u0027 offer, so she decided to make her own amateur attempt at counseling.\n \"I know the death of a fellow student is rough,\" she said in a voice that seemed overly patronizing. \"High school is a tough hormonal roller-coaster ride at times. It may become or seem unbearable,\" she added, looking at me directly.\n I looked down. How dare the whore cat draw attention to me. She didn\u0027t know me. This was why I didn\u0027t like her. I didn\u0027t need her to save me. Mitch had unintentionally done that by taking his own life. Observing the aftermath of his death had left me shuddering at the gloried tear-fest I\u0027d be providing for those who passed by my shadow each day.\n I didn\u0027t want their tears.\n I didn\u0027t want them to think of me.\n I wanted nothing from them.\n That asshole Mitch Johnson saved my life today. What a prick.\n Chapter Two\n James Isaac Garrison III, my best friend/suicide buddy, met me outside by the portables the school no longer needed. Tax money from hardworking taxpayers had finally allowed for the construction of our now rival high school, five miles away. We lost half the student body when the new school opened, along with the only decent teachers we had. Who could blame them for jumping ship? The new school had state-of-the-art equipment, brand spanking new classrooms and a teacher\u0027s lounge that was any teacher\u0027s wet dream. I\u0027m sure when faced with staying behind in our shithole, with its endless sidewalks covered in fossilized gum, crappy air conditioning and smelly cafeteria, it was an all out race to see who could leave first.\n James, my best friend, my only friend, was perched on the slanted walkway of one of the abandoned portables studying a rusted-out hole roughly the size of a softball when I joined him. If it was possible for me to love anyone, I would have loved James. I was fascinated with his blemish-free, mocha-colored skin that seemed to be as smooth as satin. I had spent hours daydreaming what his skin felt like, but had never given in to the urge. I had a strict \"do not touch\" rule.\n I\u0027ll always remember the last time I\u0027d willingly touched someone with shocking clarity. I was thirteen, and it marked the end of my life as I had once known it. I didn\u0027t have some bullshit paranormal anomaly that prevented human contact, although that might have been easier. I just didn\u0027t like to be touched anymore, not since that day. I\u0027m sure when I was little I must have felt differently, right? I mean, babies liked to be held and snuggled, so obviously, I must have liked it at one point, but no longer.\n \"You heard?\" James stated.\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s horseshit. Some of the Populars started crying. Can you believe that? They\u0027re not supposed to mourn us. They\u0027re not even supposed to think about us,\" I said, agitated as I paced up and down the metal ramp. \"How can they miss something they never knew? They\u0027ve effed up our plan,\" I said as the ramifications tore through me. In one swoop everything I had counted on had been pulled out from under me.\n \"I know. A couple chicks in my physics class did the same thing. It doesn\u0027t mean anything. We could still do it. We wouldn\u0027t be around to see their reactions…\" he started to say, but I was already shaking my head.\n \"And give those drama-loving glory-hounds something to falsely mourn over?\" I said, plopping down next to him. \"We were supposed to disappear without a single ripple. I\u0027ve given people enough reasons to talk about me. This was going to be my clean break,\" I said, fighting back the sudden moisture that had popped up in my eyes. We\u0027d spent endless hours discussing disappearing from the land of the living, and now it felt like all that time was wasted.\n \"I guess,\" James said, digging around in the rusted-out hole with a stick.\n \"We could just leave,\" I said, looking for an alternate solution.\n \"Yeah, because I\u0027m sure we\u0027d be the cream of the crop for any company looking to hire, with no high school diploma or work experience,\" James said sarcastically.\n \"Truth,\" I sighed, lying back against the metal ramp. \"I guess maybe I can make it to grad. Can you?\"\n He shrugged. I didn\u0027t push it. James\u0027s demons were different than mine. Being gay in a household with a domineering, ex-jock father wasn\u0027t easy. I\u0027d seen the dark bruises James had to prove it. He could have turned his father in. Hell, I could have turned his father in, but we didn\u0027t. Abuse came in all kinds of forms. The sad thing is that there was a time I would have envied the attention he got. That\u0027s the sick kind of person I was. I mean, what kind of effed up person envied physical abuse as a form of desirable attention?\n Me. That\u0027s who.\n When I was little, I\u0027d hoped my actions would get the reaction I craved from my parents. My attention seeking first started when I was four. I was sick of being stuck in the church daycare every single night, so I showed my displeasure by biting everyone I could sink my teeth into. I think I was hoping my actions would get me booted out and I could stay with my parents, but instead it earned me a one-way ticket to solitary confinement. They fenced me off in the far corner of the room, like a shark that couldn\u0027t be trusted with the other fish. My parents had been so unhappy with my sudden need to gnaw on other people that they even carried out the punishment at home by sending me to bed every night the moment we got home from church. Solitary confinement became my normal.\n Once I realized gnawing on humans wouldn\u0027t get me the attention I yearned for, I tried my hand at destruction. Unfortunately, I underestimated the ramifications of flushing the heads of Barbie dolls down a toilet. At first, I enjoyed watching their heads circling the bowl, but instead of riding the circular wave to oblivion, they simply clogged the pipe and the water in the bowl proceeded to rise. In hindsight, I should have told my mom, but she was by the front door hollering that we were going to be late for, you guessed it, church. I guess in my five-year-old mind, I thought maybe the problem would somehow fix itself while we were away. That would be a resounding \"hell no.\" We arrived home three hours later to a foot and half of water throughout the entire house. I got spanked for that one, and for a moment, I was almost happy, thinking they did actually care about me. My destructive nature was short-lived when everything in the house below the waist had to be replaced—furnishing, carpeting, drywall and all my toys. I didn\u0027t miss my dolls with their freaky happy faces or my now decapitated Barbies, but I mourned the loss of my picture books that I would leaf through for hours at a time. Damn those fat Barbie heads. I blamed them for my loss, and to this day I can\u0027t walk down the sickeningly pink Barbie aisle of any store.\n I moved right from destruction to a daredevil stage, by climbing anything and everything. I became an expert at scaling heights. My mom would find me perched on top of the fridge, the top shelf of my closet, and my all-time favorite, the roof of the house. The first time I climbed on top of the house she called the fire department to get me down. The kind fireman who scaled the roof plucked me up like a sack of potatoes and carried me down. He lectured me on safety and the harm I could have come to. I soaked his words up like a sponge, and the next time I scaled the roof, I waited for one of the tragic events he\u0027d claimed would occur, but after an hour had passed without a sudden fall resulting in multiple broken bones, I was highly disappointed. None of his prophecies came to pass, so I was once again plucked off the roof by another fireman. This one wasn\u0027t so kind and told my mom to keep a better eye on me since their services were needed for real emergencies. I guess I should have expected bars on my window after that, but Mom solved the problem by limiting my time at home, which meant more time at church. So, in a way, she found the ultimate punishment. Church always won. It stole every hour I was supposed to have with my parents. I hated the thieving bastard.\n \"So, what do you think?\" James asked, breaking through my thoughts.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, what did you say?\" I asked.\n \"I said, do you want to hang after school? My dad\u0027s working double shifts all week, so I\u0027m free. Maybe we can hang at your house. You know, talk about \u0027it\u0027.\"\n \"It\" was how we referred to our pact. We always avoided the word suicide, feeling once it was uttered someone would somehow find out and try to intervene. Who would have ever foreseen that the actions of one would be the very thing that would seal my fate? For four years I had done nothing but contemplate snuffing out my existence. No more judgments, no more glares and most of all, no more gossip surrounding things I had done. All of that was swiped away. In the end, they would still win. They always won.\n \"Can\u0027t, I have freaking tutoring,\" I said, finally answering his question as I grimaced at the idea of staying at school a minute longer than I wanted to.\n \"Tutoring? I thought all your teachers had given up on you,\" he said, trying to hide his disappointment. He hated his house even when his father wasn\u0027t home.\n \"Not that bitch Ms. Jones. It\u0027s either tutoring with some know-it-all, or she wants to schedule a meeting with my mom.\n \"Would she even show?\" he asked.\n \"Probably not. You know her rules though—either I keep my nose clean here and my grades passing, or she\u0027s sending me to that bullshit trade school for troubled teens in Jackson County.\"\n \"I can tutor you,\" he said as a last-ditch attempt.\n \"I told Whore Cat that, but she said either I used her approved tutor or it was conference time. I\u0027ll try to duck out early and we can meet at my house. I\u0027ll give you my key and you can head there to wait for me.\"\n \"Nah, that\u0027s okay. I can go to my house,\" he said reluctantly.\n \"James, it\u0027s fine. Hang at my house.\"\n \"You sure?\"\n \"Sure. No one will be home. You\u0027ll have the house to yourself until I get there.\"\n \"Thanks, M,\" he said, looking almost happy at the rare solitude he\u0027d have.\n In our own demented way, we were made for each other. He craved solitude while I felt solitude was a just punishment.\n \"So, who\u0027s your tutor?\" he asked, laying back down next to me.\n \"I\u0027m not sure. Whore Cat was pretty much closemouthed about it. Knowing my luck, it\u0027ll be some eager beaver freshman.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/miss-me-not/page-1.html","bookId":2782,"book":{"id":2782,"title":"Miss Me Not","description":"Storyline: \n Miss Me Not is a beautiful story of self-discovery, forgiveness, caring, and love. \n Madison Hanson\u0027s past demons have given her a shadow of an existence with little hope.
