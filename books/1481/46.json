{"id":28682,"no":46,"title":"PART THE THIRD CHAPTER I. IN GROSVENOR PLACE","content":"A well-spread dessert-table glittered under the rays of the chandelier in the dining-room of Sir Nash Bohun\u0027s town-house. Sir Nash and his nephew Arthur were seated at it, a guest between them. It was General Strachan; an old officer, Scotch by birth, who had just come home, after passing the best part of his life in India. \\n\\n \\n\\n The winter was departing. Arthur Bohun looked better, Sir Nash pretty well. In a month or two both intended to depart for the German springs that were to renovate Sir Nash\u0027s life. \\n\\n \\n\\n General Strachan had been intimate with Sir Nash Bohun in early life, before he went out to India. After he had gone out he had been equally intimate with Major Bohun: but he was only Captain Strachan in those days. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so you think Arthur like his father,\" observed Sir Nash, as he passed the claret. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His very image,\" replied the general. \"I\u0027m sure I should have known him for Tom Bohun\u0027s son had I met him accidentally in the street. Adair saw the likeness, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What Adair\u0027s that?\" carelessly asked Sir Nash. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"William Adair. You saw him with me at the club-door this morning. We were going in at the moment you came up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Perhaps Sir Nash was a little struck by the name. He called to mind a good-looking, slender, gentlemanly man, who had been arm-in-arm with the general at the time mentioned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what Adair is it, Strachan?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What Adair? Why, the one who was in India when--when poor Tom died. He was Tom\u0027s greatest friend. Perhaps you have never heard of him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes I have, to my sorrow,\" said Sir Nash. \"It was he who caused poor Tom\u0027s death.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n General Strachan apparently did not understand. \"Who caused poor Tom\u0027s death?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Adair.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, bless me, where could you have picked that up?\" cried the general in surprise. \"If Adair could have saved Tom\u0027s life by any sacrifice to himself he\u0027d have done it. They were firm friends to the last.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir Nash seemed to be listening as though he heard not. \"Of course we never heard the particulars of my brother\u0027s death, over here, as we should have heard them had we been on the spot,\" he remarked. \"We were glad, rather, to hush it up for the sake of Arthur. Poor Tom fell into some trouble or disgrace, and Adair led him into it. That\u0027s what we were ever told.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you were told wrong, Bohun,\" said the general somewhat bluntly. \"Tom fell into debt, and I don\u0027t know what all, but it was not Adair who led him into it. Who could have told you so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mrs. Bohun, Tom\u0027s widow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, she,\" returned the general, in accents of contempt that spoke volumes. \"Why she--but never mind now,\" he broke off, suddenly glancing at Arthur as he remembered that she was his mother. \"Let bygones be bygones,\" he added, sipping his claret; \"no good recalling them. Only don\u0027t continue to think anything against William Adair. He is one of the best men living, and always has been.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur Bohun, who had sat still as a stone, leaned his pale face a little towards the general, and spoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did not this Mr. Adair, after my father\u0027s death, get into disgrace, and--and undergo its punishment?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never. Adair got into no disgrace.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has he not been a convict?\" continued Arthur in low, clear tones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A WHAT?\" cried the general, putting down his glass and staring at Arthur in amazement. \"My good young fellow, you cannot know of whom you are speaking. William Adair has been a respected man all his life: he is just as honourable as your father was--and the world knew pretty well what poor Tom\u0027s fastidious notions of honour were. Adair is a gentleman amongst gentlemen; I can\u0027t say better of him than that, though I talked for an hour. He has come into all the family honours and fortune; which he never expected to do. A good old Scotch family it is, too; better than mine. There; we\u0027ll drop the subject now; no good reaping up things that are past and done with.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir Nash asked no more: neither did Arthur. Some instinct lay within both that, for their own sakes, it might be better not to do so. \\n\\n \\n\\n But when the general left--which he did very soon, having an evening engagement--Arthur went out with him. Arthur Bohun knew, as well as though he had been told, that his wicked mother--he could only so think of her in that moment--had dealt treacherously with him; to answer some end of her own she had calumniated Mr. Adair. Cost him what pain and shame it might, he would clear it up now. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you give me the particulars that you would not give to my uncle,\" began Arthur in agitation, the moment they were out of the house, as he placed his hand on the general\u0027s arm. \"No matter what they are, I must know them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I would give them to your uncle, and welcome,\" said the plain old soldier. \"It was to you I would not give them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I must learn them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not from me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you will not give them to me, I shall apply to William Adair.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"William Adair can give them to you if he pleases. I shall not do so. Take advice, my dear young friend, and don\u0027t inquire into them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will tell you what I suspect--that if any one had a hand in driving my father to--to do what he did do, it was his wife; my mother. You may tell me now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No. Because she is your mother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I have the most urgent reason for wishing to arrive at the particulars.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Arthur Bohun, I would rather not tell you, and that\u0027s the truth. If poor Tom could hear me in his grave, I don\u0027t think he would like it, you see. No, I can\u0027t tell you. Ask Adair, first of all, whether he\u0027d advise it, or not.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where is he staying?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In Grosvenor Place. He and his daughter are in a furnished house there. She is very delicate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And--you say--I beg your pardon, general,\" added Arthur in agitation, detaining him as he was going away--\"You say that he is honoured, and a gentleman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who? Adair? As much so as you or I, my young friend. You must be dreaming. Goodnight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In his mind\u0027s tumult any delay seemed dreadful, and Arthur Bohun turned at once to the house in Grosvenor Place. He asked if he could see Mr. Adair. \\n\\n \\n\\n The servant hesitated. \"There is no Mr. Adair here, sir,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur looked up at the number. \"Are you sure?\" he asked of the man. \"I was informed by General Strachan that Mr. Adair had taken this house, and was living here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The general must have said Sir William, sir. Sir William Adair lives here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh--Sir William,\" spoke Arthur, \"I--I was not aware Mr. Adair had been knighted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Knighted, sir! My master has not been knighted,\" cried the man, as if indignant at the charge. \"Sir William has succeeded to the baronetcy through the death of his uncle, Sir Archibald.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n What with one thing and another, Arthur\u0027s senses seemed deserting him. Sir Archibald Adair had been well known to him by reputation: a proud old Scotch baronet, of a grand old lineage. And so this was Ellen\u0027s family! And he had been deeming her not fitting to mate with him, a Bohun! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can I see Sir William? Is he at home?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is at home, sir. I think you can see him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In his dining-room sat Sir William Adair when Arthur was shown in--some coffee on a stand by his side, a newspaper in his hand. He was a slight man of rather more than middle height, with an attractive countenance. The features were good, their expression noble and pleasing. It was impossible to associate such a face and bearing with anything like dishonour. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe my name is not altogether strange to you, sir,\" said Arthur as the servant closed the door. \"I hope you will pardon my intrusion--and especially that it should be at this late hour.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir William had risen to receive him. He could but mark the agitation with which the words were spoken. A moment\u0027s hesitation, and then he took Arthur\u0027s hand and clasped it within his own. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I wished to be distant with you I could not,\" he said warmly. \"For, to me, you appear as your father come to life again. He and I were fast friends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And did you wish to be distant with me?\" asked Arthur. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have felt cold towards you this many a year. More than that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But why, Sir William?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah--why. I cannot tell you. For one thing, I have pictured you as resembling another, more than my lost friend.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mean my mother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir William looked at Arthur Bohun before replying. \"Yes, I do. Will you take a seat: and some coffee?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur sat down, but it may be questioned whether he as much as heard that coffee was mentioned. Sir William rang the bell and ordered it to be brought in. Arthur leaned forward; his blue eyes solemnly earnest, his hand a little outstretched. Sir William almost started. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How strangely like!\" he exclaimed. \"The look, the gesture, the voice, all are your father\u0027s over again. I could fancy that you were Thomas Bohun--as I last saw him in life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You knew him well--and my mother? You knew all about them?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quite well. I knew you too when you were a little child.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then tell me one thing,\" said Arthur, his emotion increasing. \"Was she my mother?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The question surprised Sir William Adair. \"She was certainly your mother, and your father\u0027s wife. Why do you ask it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because--she has so acted--that I--have many a time wished she was not. I have almost hoped it. I wish I could hope it now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah,\" cried Sir William. It was all he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you care much, for my father, Sir William?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"More than I ever cared for any other man. I have never cared for one since as I cared for him. We were young fellows then, he and I; not much older than you are now; but ours was a true friendship.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I conjure you, by that friendship, to disclose to me the whole history of the past: the circumstances attending my father\u0027s death, and its cause. Speak of things as though my mother existed not. I wish to Heaven she never had been my mother!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think you must know something of the circumstances,\" spoke Sir William. \"Or why should you say this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is because I know part that I must know the whole. My mother has--has lied to me,\" he concluded, bringing out the word with a painful effort. \"She has thrust a false story upon me, and--I cannot rest until I know the truth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Arthur Bohun, although you conjure me by your late father: and for his sake I would do a great deal: I fear that I ought not to do this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"General Strachan bade me come to you. I begged him to tell me all, but he said no. Does he know all?\" broke off Arthur. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Every tittle. I think he and I and your mother are nearly the only three left who do know it. There were only some half-dozen of us altogether.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And do you not think that I, Major Bohun\u0027s only son, should at least be made acquainted with as much as others know? Tell me all, Sir William: for my lost father\u0027s sake.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The only difficulty is--that you must hear ill of your mother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot hear worse of her than I already know,\" impetuously returned Arthur. \"Perhaps it was less bad than I am imagining it may have been.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Sir William held back. Arthur seemed on the brink of a fever in his impatience. And, whether it was that, or to clear the memory of Major Bohun, or that he deemed it a righteous thing to satisfy Major Bohun\u0027s son, or that he yielded to overpersuasion, Sir William Adair at last spoke out. \\n\\n \\n\\n They sat very close together, only the small coffee-table between them. Whether the room was in light or darkness neither remembered. It was a miserable tale they were absorbed in; one that need not be elaborated here. \\n\\n \\n\\n William Adair, when a young man, quarrelled with his family, or they with him, and an estrangement took place. His father and mother were dead, but his uncle, Sir Archibald, and other relatives, were left. He, the young man, went to the Madras Presidency, appointed to some post there in the civil service. His family made a boast of discarding him; he, in return, was so incensed against them, that had it been practicable, he would have abandoned the very name of Adair. Never a word did he breathe to any one of who or what his family was; his Scotch accent betrayed his country, but people knew no more. That he was a gentleman was apparent, and that was sufficient. \\n\\n \\n\\n A strong friendship ensued between him and Major Bohun. During one hot season it happened that both went up in search of health to the Blue Mountains, as Indians call the beautiful region of the Neilgherry Hills. Mrs. Bohun accompanied her husband; Mr. Adair was not married. There they made the acquaintance of the Reverend George Cumberland, who was stationed at Ootacamund with his wife. Ootacamund was at that time filled, and a good deal of gaiety was going on; Mrs. Bohun was noted for it. There was some gambling nightly: and no votary joined in it more persistently than she. Major Bohun removed with her to a little place at a short distance, and a few others went also; the chaplain, George Cumberland, was one of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n There came a frightful day for Major Bohun. Certain claims suddenly swooped down upon him; debts; promissory notes, bearing his signature in conjunction with William Adair\u0027s. Neither understood what it meant, for they had given nothing of the sort. A momentary thought arose to Major Bohun--that his wife was implicated in it; but only so far as that she might have joined in this high play; nothing worse. He had become aware that she had a passion for gambling, and the discovery had alarmed him: in fact, it was to wean her from undesirable associates and pursuits that he had come away on this holiday; health, the ostensible plea, was not the true one. But this was not known even to his best friend, William Adair. \"Let me deal with this,\" said the major to Mr. Adair. But Mr. Adair, not choosing to allow a man to forge his name with impunity--and he had no suspicion that it was a woman--did not heed the injunction, but addressed himself to the investigation. And a nest of iniquity he found it. He traced the affair home to one Rabbetson--in all probability an assumed name--a bad man in every way; no better than a blackleg; who had wormed himself into society to prey upon it, and upon men and women\u0027s failings. This man Mr. Adair confronted with Major Bohun: and then--the fellow, brought to bay, braved it out by disclosing that his helpmate was Mrs. Bohun. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was even so. Mr. Adair sat aghast at the revelation. Had he suspected this, he would have kept it to himself. How far she had connected herself with this man, it was best not to inquire: and they never did inquire, and never knew. One thing was certain--the man could afford to take a high ground. He went out from the interview bidding them do their worst--which with him would not be much, he affirmed; for it was not he who had issued the false bills, but the major\u0027s wife. And they saw that he spoke the truth. \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur Bohun listened to this now, motionless as a statue. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never saw any man so overcome as Bohun,\" continued Sir William Adair. \"He took it to heart; to heart. \u0027And she is the mother of my child!\u0027 he said to me; and then he gave way, and held my hands in his, and sobbed aloud. \u0027We will hush it up; we will take up the bills and other obligations,\u0027 I said to him: though in truth I did not see how I should do my part in it, for I was a poor man. He was poor also; his expenses and his wife kept him so. \u0027It cannot be hushed up, Adair,\u0027 he answered; \u0027it has gone too far.\u0027 Those were the last words he ever said to me; it was the last time I saw him alive.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go on,\" said Arthur, without raising his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mrs. Bohun came into the room, and I quitted it. I saw by her face that she knew what had happened; it was full of evil as she turned it on me. Rabbetson had met her when he was going out, and whispered some words in her ear. What passed between her and Major Bohun I never knew. Before I had been five minutes in my rooms she stood before me; had followed me down. Of all the vituperation that a woman\u0027s tongue can utter, hers lavished about the worst on me. It was I who had brought on the crisis, she said; it was I who had taken Rabbetson to her husband. I quietly told her that when I took Rabbetson to Major Bohun, I had not the remotest idea that she was mixed up with the affair in any way; and that if I had known it, known what Rabbetson could say, I never should have taken him, but have striven to deal with it myself, and keep it dark for my friend Bohun\u0027s sake. She would hear nothing; she was as a mad woman; she swore that not a word of it was true; that Rabbetson did not say it, could not have said it, but that I and Major Bohun had concocted the tale between us. In short, I think she was really mad for the time being.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stay a moment, Sir William,\" interrupted Arthur. \"Who was she? I have never known. I don\u0027t think my father\u0027s family ever did know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Neither did I ever know, to a certainty. A cousin, or sister, or some relative of hers, had married a doctor in practice at Madras, and she was out there on a visit to them. Captain Bohun--as he was then--caught by her face and figure, both fine in those days, fell in love with her and married her. He afterwards found that her father kept an hotel somewhere in England.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So! This was the high-born lady who had set up for being above all Dallory. But for the utmost self-control Arthur Bohun would have groaned aloud. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go on, please,\" was all he said. \"Get it finished.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is not much more to tell,\" returned Sir William. \"I went looking about for Bohun everywhere that afternoon; and could not find him. Just before sun-down he was found--found as--as I dare say you have heard. The spot was retired and shady, his pistol lay beside him. He had not suffered: death must have been instantaneous.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The report here was that he died of sunstroke,\" said Arthur, breaking a long pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No doubt. Mrs. Bohun caused it to be so reported. The real facts transpired to very few: Cumberland, Captain Strachan, myself, and two or three others.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did Mrs. Cumberland know them?\" suddenly asked Arthur, a thought striking him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I dare say not. I don\u0027t suppose her husband would disclose the shameful tale to her. She was not on the spot at the time; had gone to nurse some friend who was ill. I respected both the Cumberlands highly. We made a sort of compact amongst ourselves, we men, never to speak of this story, unless it should be to defend Bohun, or for some other good purpose. We wished to give Mrs. Bohun a chance of redeeming her acts and doings in her own land, for which she at once sailed. Arthur, if I have had to say this to you, it is to vindicate your dead father. I believe that your mother has dreaded me ever since.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dreaded him! Ay! and foully aspersed him in her insane dread. Arthur thought of the wicked invention she had raised, and passed his hands upon his face as if he could shut out its remembrance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What became of Rabbetson?\" he asked, in low tones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He disappeared. Or I think I should surely have shot him in his turn, or kicked him to death. I saw him afterwards in Australia dying in the most abject misery.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And the claims?--the bills?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I took them upon myself; and contrived to pay all--with time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You left India for Australia?\" continued Arthur, after a pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My health failed, and I petitioned government to remove me to a different climate. They complied, and sent me to Australia. I stayed there, trying to accumulate a competency that should enable me to live at home with Ellen as befitted my family: little supposing that I was destined to become its head. My two cousins, Sir Archibald\u0027s sons, have died one after the other.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur Bohun had heard all he wished to know, perhaps all there was to tell. If--if he could make his peace with Ellen, the old relations between them might yet be renewed. But whilst his heart bounded with the hope, the red of shame crimsoned his brow as he thought of the past. Glancing at the timepiece on the mantel-shelf, he saw it was only half-past nine; not too late yet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"May I see your daughter, sir?\" he asked. \"We used to be good friends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I suppose,\" replied Sir William. \"You made love to her, Arthur Bohun. You would have married her, I believe, but that I stopped it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You--stopped it!\" exclaimed Arthur, at sea: for he had known nothing of the letter received by Ellen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wrote to Ellen, telling her I must forbid her to marry you. I feared at the time of writing that the interdict might arrive too late. But it seems that it did not do so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" abstractedly returned Arthur, letting pass what he did not understand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You see, I had been thinking of you always as belonging to her--your mother--more than to him. That mistake is over. I shall value you now as his son; more I dare say than I shall ever value any other young man in this world.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur\u0027s breath came fast and thick. \"Then--you--you would give her to me, sir!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir William shook his head in sadness. Arthur misunderstood the meaning. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The probability is, sir, that I shall succeed my uncle in the baronetcy. Would it not satisfy you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can see her if you will,\" was Sir William\u0027s answer, but there was the same sad sort of denial in his manner. \"I would not say No now for your father\u0027s sake. She is in the drawing-room, upstairs. I will join you as soon as I have written a note.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur found his way by instinct. Ellen was lying back in an easy-chair; the brilliant light of the chandelier on her face. Opening the door softly, it--that face--was the first object that met his sight. And he started back in terror. \\n\\n \\n\\n Was it death that he saw written there? All too surely conviction came home to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a more momentous interview than the one just over. Explaining he knew not how, explaining he knew not what, excepting that his love had never left her, Arthur Bohun knelt at her feet, and they mingled their tears together. For some minutes neither could understand the other: but elucidation came at last. Arthur told her that the wicked tale, the frightful treachery which had parted them was only a concocted fable on his mother\u0027s part, and then he found that Ellen had never known, never heard anything, about it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What then did you think was the matter with me?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n And she told him. She told him without reserve, now that she found how untrue it was: she thought he had given her up for another. Madam had informed her he was about to marry Miss Dallory. \\n\\n \\n\\n He took in the full sense of what the words implied: the very abject light in which his conduct must have appeared to her. A groan burst from him: he covered his face to hide its shame and trouble. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ellen! Ellen! You could not have thought it of me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was what I did think. How was I to think anything else? Your mother had said it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Heaven forgive her her sins!\" he wailed, in his despair. \"It was enough to kill you, Ellen. No wonder you look like this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She was panting a little. Her breathing seemed very laboured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pray Heaven I may be enabled to make it up to you when you are my wife. I will try hard, my darling.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall not live for it, Arthur.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His heart seemed to stand still. The words struck him as being so very real. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Arthur, I have known it for some time now. You must not grieve for me. I even think that death is rather near.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What has killed you? I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A flush passed over her wan face. Yes, he had killed her. That is, his conduct had done so: the sensitive crimson betrayed it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The probability is that I should not in any case have lived long,\" she said, aloud. \"I believe they feared something of the sort for me years ago. Arthur, don\u0027t! Don\u0027t weep; I cannot bear it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir William Adair had just told him how his father had wept in his misery. And before Arthur could well collect himself, Sir William entered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You see,\" he whispered aside to Arthur, \"why it may not be. There will be no marriage for her in this life. I am not surprised. I seem to have always expected it: my wife, her mother, died of decline.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur Bohun quitted the house, overwhelmed with shame and sorrow. What regret is there like unto that for past mistaken conduct which can never be remedied in this world? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2687/74008.html","bookId":1481,"book":{"id":1481,"title":"Bessy Rane","description":"简介： It was an intensely dark night.
