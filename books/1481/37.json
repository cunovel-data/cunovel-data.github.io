{"id":28673,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. MISCHIEF BREWING IN NORTH INLET","content":"Morning, noon and night, whenever the small body of fresh workmen had to pass to and from the works, they were accompanied by the two policemen specially engaged to protect them, whilst others hovered within call. North Inlet, the ill-feeling of its old inhabitants increasing day by day, had become dangerous. It was not that all the men would have done violence. Ketler, for instance, and others, well-disposed men by nature, sensible and quiet, would not have lifted a hand against those who had, in one sense of the word, displaced them. But they did this: they stood tamely by, knowing quite well that some of their comrades only waited their opportunity to kill, or disable--as might be--Richard North\u0027s new followers. North Inlet was not quite so full as it used to be: for some of the old inhabitants, weary and out of patience with hope deferred: hope they hardly knew of what, unless for the good time promised by the Trades\u0027 union: had departed on the tramp, with their wives and little ones, seeking a corner of the earth where work sufficient to give them a crust of bread and a roof, might be found. Others had decamped without their wives and children: and were in consequence being sought by the parish. North Inlet, taken on the whole, was in a sore plight. The men and women, reduced by want and despair to apply for parish relief, found none accorded them. They had brought themselves to this condition; had refused work when work was to be had; and to come and ask to be supported in idleness by the parish was a procedure not to be tolerated or entertained; as one resolute guardian, sitting at the head of a table, fiercely told them. Not as much as a loaf of bread would be given them, added another. If it came to the pass that they were in danger of dying of hunger--as the applicants urged--why they must come into the house with their wives and families: and a humiliating shame that would be for able-bodied men, the guardian added: but they would receive no relief out-of-doors. So North Inlet, not choosing to go into that unpopular refuge for the destitute, kept out of it. And to terrible straits were they reduced! Looking back upon their past life of plenty, and their present empty homes and famished faces, little wonder that this misguided body of men grew to find that something of the old Satan was in them yet. A great deal of it, too. Perhaps remorse held its full share with them. They had intended that it should be so entirely for the better when they threw up work; and it had turned out so surprisingly for the worse. They had meant to return to work on their own terms; earning more and toiling less: they had been led to believe that this result lay in their own hands, and was as safe and certain as that the sun shone overhead at noonday. Instead of that--here they were, in as deplorable a condition as human beings could well be; Time had been, not very long ago either, that the false step might have been redeemed; Richard North had offered them work again on the old terms. Ay, and he had once conceded a portion of their demands--as they remembered well. But that time and that offer had gone by for ever. Fresh men (few though they were) had taken their places, and they themselves were starving and helpless. The feeling against these new men was bitter enough; it was far more bitter against the small number of old workmen who had gone back again. We are told that the heart of man is desperately wicked: our own experience shows us that it is desperately selfish. They saw the employed men doing the work which once was theirs; they saw them wearing good coats, eating good food. They themselves had neither one nor the other; and work they had rejected. It would not have seemed quite so hard had the work altogether left the place: but to see these others doing it and living in comfort was more than mortal temper could brook. This was not all. The men unreasonably held to it that these others having taken work again, was the cause why they themselves were kept out of it. Richard North would ha\u0027 come-to, they said, if these curs hadn\u0027t went sneaking back again to lick his hand. If all had held out, Dick North must ha\u0027 given in. And this they repeated so constantly, in their ire, one to another, that at last they grew to believe it. It was quite wrong, and they were wholly mistaken: for had Richard North not begun again cautiously as he did, and on the old terms, he would not have recommenced at all: but the men refused to see this, and held to their idea, making it a greater grievance than the want of food. It is so convenient to have something substantial on which to throw blame: and unlimited power and permission to punch the obnoxious head would have afforded intense gratification. Oh, it was very hard to bear. To see this small knot of men re-established in work, and to know that it was their own work once, and might have been theirs still! Peeping through hedges, hiding within doorways, standing sulkily or derisively in the open ground, they would watch the men going to and fro, guarded by the two policemen. Many a bitter word, many a silent threat was levelled at the small band. Murder had been done from a state of mind not half as bad as they were cherishing. \"What be you looking at, with those evil frowns on your faces?\" A group of malcontents, gazing from a corner of North Inlet at the daily procession, found this question suddenly sounding on their ears. Mrs. Gass had stepped out of a dwelling close by, and put it to them. Their eyes were following the escorted men coming home to their twelve-o\u0027clock dinner, so that they had not observed her. They turned to her, and dropped their threatening expression. A man named Poole, not too much respected in the most prosperous times, and one of the worst of the malcontents, answered boldly too. \"We was taking the measure o\u0027 that small lot o\u0027 convic\u0027s. Wishing we could brand \u0027em.\" \"Ah,\" said Mrs. Gass. \"It strikes me some of you have been wishing it before to-day. I should like to give you a bit of advice, my men; and you, especially, Poole. Take care you don\u0027t become convicts yourselves.\" \"For two pins, I\u0027d do what \u0027ud make me one,\" was the rejoinder of Poole, who was in a more defiant mood than even he often dared exhibit. He was a large, thick-set man, with shaggy light hair and a brick-dust complexion. His clothes, originally fustian, had been worn and torn and patched until they now hardly held together. \"You are a nice jail-bird, Poole! I don\u0027t think you ever were much better than one,\" added Mrs. Gass. To which candid avowal Poole only replied by a growl. \"These hard times be enough to make jail-birds of all of us,\" interposed another, Foster; but speaking civilly. \"Why don\u0027t the Government come down and interfere, and prevent our work being took out of our hands by these rascals?\" \"You put the work out of your own hands,\" said Mrs. Gass. \"As to interference, I should have thought you\u0027d had about enough of that, by this time. If you had not suffered them fine Trades\u0027 unionists to interfere with you, my men, you\u0027d have been in full work now, happy and contented as the day\u0027s long.\" \"What we did, we did for the best.\" \"What you did, you did in defiance of common sense, and of the best counsels of your best friends,\" she said. \"How many times did your master show you what the upshot would be if you persisted in throwing up your work?--how much breath did I waste upon you, as I\u0027m doing now, asking you all to avoid a strike--and after the strike had come, day after day begging you to end it?--could any picture be truer than mine when I said what you\u0027d bring yourselves to?--rags, and famine, and desolate homes. Could any plight be worse than this that you\u0027ve dropped into now?\" \"No, it couldn\u0027t,\" answered Foster. \"It\u0027s so bad that I say Government ought to interfere for us.\" \"If I was Government, I should interfere on one point--and that\u0027s with them agitating unionists,\" bravely spoke Mrs. Gass. \"I should put them down a bit.\" \"This is a free country, ma\u0027am,\" struck in Ketler, who made one of the group. \"Well, I used to think it was, Ketler,\" she said; \"but old ways seem to be turned upside down. What sort of freedom do you enjoy just now?--how much have you had of it since you bound yourselves sworn members of the Trades\u0027 unions? You have wanted to work and they haven\u0027t let you: you\u0027d like to be clothed and fed as you used to be and to clothe and feed your folks at home, and they prevent your exercising the means by which you may do it. What freedom or liberty is there in that?--Come, Ketler, tell me, as a reasonable man.\" \"If the Trades\u0027 unions could do as they wish, there\u0027d be work and comfort for all of us.\" \"I doubt that, Ketler.\" \"But they can\u0027t do it,\" added Ketler. \"The masters be obstinate and won\u0027t let \u0027em.\" \"That\u0027s just it,\" said Mrs. Gass. \"If the Trades\u0027 unions held the world in their hands, and there were no such things as masters and capital, why then they might have their own way. But the masters have their own interests to look after, their business and capital to defend: and the two sides are totally opposed one to the other, and squabbling is all that comes of it, or that ever will come of it. You lose your work, the masters lose their trade, the unionists fight it out fiercer than ever--and, between it all, the commerce of the country is coming to an end. Now, my men, that is the bare truth; and you can\u0027t deny it if you talk till midnight.\" \"\u0027Twouldn\u0027t be no longer much of a free country, if the Government put down the Trades\u0027 unions,\" spoke a man satirically; one Cattleton. \"But it ought to put down their arbitrary way of preventing others working that want to work,\" maintained Mrs. Gass. \"The unionists be your worst enemies. I\u0027m speaking, as you know I have been all along, of the heads among \u0027em who make laws for the rest; not of poor sheep like yourselves who have joined the society in innocence. If the heads like to live without work themselves, and can point out a way by which others can live without it, well and good; there\u0027s no law against that, nor oughtn\u0027t to be; but what I say Government ought to put down is this--their forcing you men to reject work when it\u0027s offered you. It\u0027s a sin and a shame that, through them, the country should be brought to imbecility, and you, its once free and brave workmen, to beggary.\" \"The thought has come over me at times that under the new state of things we are no better than slaves,\" confessed Ketler, his eyes wearing an excited look. \"Now you\u0027ve just said it, Ketler,\" cried Mrs. Gass, triumphantly. \"Slaves. That\u0027s exactly what you are; and I wish to my heart all the workmen in England could open their eyes to the truth of it. You took a vow to obey the dictates of the Trades\u0027 union; it has bound you hand and foot, body and soul. If a job of work lay to your hand, you dare not take it up; no, not though you saw your little ones dying of famine before your eyes. It\u0027s the worst kind of slavery that ever fell on the land. Press-gangs used to be bad enough, but this beats \u0027em hollow.\" There was no reply from any of the men. Mrs. Gass had been a good friend to their families even recently; and the old habits of respect to her, their mistress, still held sway. Perhaps some of them, too, silently assented to her reasoning. \"It\u0027s that that I\u0027d have put down,\" she resumed. \"Let every workman be free to act on his own judgment, to take work or to leave it. Not but what it\u0027s too late to say so: as far as I believe, the mischief has gone too far to be remedied.\" \"It be mighty fine for the masters to cry out and say the Trades\u0027 unions is our enemies! Suppose we choose to call \u0027em our friends?\" spoke Poole. \"Put it so, Poole, if you like,\" said Mrs. Gass equably. \"The society\u0027s your friend, let\u0027s say. How has it showed its friendship? what has it done for you?\" Mr. Poole did not condescend to say. \"It\u0027s not hard to answer, Poole. The proofs, lie on the surface; not one of you but may read \u0027em off-hand. It threw you all out of good work that you had held for years under a good master, that you might probably have held, to the last day of your lives. It dismantled your homes and sent your things to the pawnshop. It has reduced you to a crust of bread, where you used to have good joints of beef; it has taken your warm shoes and coats, and sent you abroad half naked. Your children are starving, some of them are dead; your wives are worn out with trouble and discontent. And this not for a time, but for good: for, there\u0027s no prospect open to you. No prospect, that I can see, as I am a living woman. That\u0027s what your friends, as you call \u0027em, have done for you; and for thousands and thousands beside you. I don\u0027t care what they meant: let it be that they meant well by you, and that you meant well--as I\u0027m sure you did--in listening to \u0027em: the result is as I\u0027ve said. And you are standing here this day, ruined men.\" Mr. Poole looked fierce. \"What is to become of you, and of others ruined like you, the Lord in heaven only knows. It\u0027s a solemn question. When the best trade of the country\u0027s driven from it, there\u0027s no longer any place for workmen. Emigration, suggest some of the newspapers. Others say emigration\u0027s overdone for the present. We don\u0027t know what to believe. Any way, it\u0027s a hard thing that a good workman should find no employment in his native land, but must be packed off, very much as if he was transported, to be an exile for ever.\" Poole, not liking the picture, broke into an oath or two. The other men looked sad enough. \"You have been drinking, Poole,\" said Mrs. Gass with dignity, \"Keep a civil tongue in your head before me if, you please.\" \"I\u0027ve not had no more than half-a-pint,\" growled Poole. \"And that was half-a-pint too much,\" said Mrs. Gass. \"When people\u0027s insides are reduced by famine, half-a-pint is enough to upset their brains in a morning.\" \"What business have Richard North to go and engage them frogs o\u0027 Frenchmen?\" demanded Poole who had in truth taken too much for his good. \"What business have them other fellows, as ought to have stuck by us, to go back to him? It\u0027s Richard North as wants to be transported.\" \"Richard North was a good master to you. The world never saw a better.\" \"He\u0027s a rank bad man now.\" \"No, no--hold th\u0027 tongue!\" put in Ketler. \"No good to abuse him.\" \"If you men had had a spark of gratitude, you\u0027d have listened to Mr. Richard North, when he prayed you to go back to him,\" said Mrs. Gass. \"No, you wouldn\u0027t; and what has it done for him? Why, just ruined him, my men: almost as bare as you are ruined. It has took his hopes from him; wasted what little money he had; played the very dickens with his prospects. The business he once had never will and never can come back. If once you break a mirror to pieces, you can\u0027t put it together again. Mr. Richard has a life of work to look forward to; he may earn a living, but he won\u0027t do much more. You men have at least the satisfaction of knowing that whilst you ruined your own prosperity, you also ruined his.\" They had talked so long--for all that passed cannot be recorded--that it was close upon one o\u0027clock, and the small band of workmen and the two policemen were seen coming back again towards the works. The malignant look rose again on Poole\u0027s face: and he gave forth a savage growl. \"There\u0027ll be mischief yet,\" thought Mrs. Gass, as she turned away. Sounds of a woman\u0027s sobbing were proceeding from an open door as she went down North Inlet, and Mrs. Gass stepped in to see what might be the matter. They came from Dawson\u0027s wife. Dawson had been beating her. The unhappy state to which they were reduced tried the tempers of the men--of the women also, for that matter--rendering some of them little better than ferocious beasts. In the old days, when Dawson could keep himself and his family in comfort, never a cross word had been heard from him: but all that was changed; and under the new order of things, it often came to blows. The wife had now been struck in the eye. Smarting under ills of body and ills of mind, the woman enlarged on her wrongs to Mrs. Gass, and displayed the mark; all of which at another time she would certainly have concealed. The home was miserably bare; the children, wan and thin, were in tatters like their mother; it was a comprehensive picture of wretchedness. \"And all through those idiots having thrown up their work at the dictates of the Trades\u0027 union!\" was the wrathful comment of Mrs. Gass, as she departed. \"They\u0027ve done for themselves in this world: and, to judge by the unchristian lives they are living, seem to be in a fair way of doing for themselves in the next.\" As she reached her own house, the smart housemaid was showing Miss Dallory out of it. That young lady, making a call on Mrs. Gass, had waited for her a short time, and was departing. They now went in together. Mrs. Gass, entering her handsome drawing-room, began recounting the events of the morning; what she had heard and seen. \"There\u0027ll be mischief, as sure as a gun,\" she concluded. \"My belief is, that some of them would kill Mr. Richard if they had only got the chance.\" Mary Dallory looked startled. \"Kill him!\" she cried. \"Why, he has always been their friend. He would have been so still, had they only been willing.\" \"He\u0027s a better friend to them still than they are aware of,\" said Mrs. Gass, nodding her head wisely. \"Miss Mary, if ever there was a Christian man on earth, it is Richard North. His whole life has been one long thought for others. Who else has kept up Dallory Hall? Who would have worked and slaved on, and on, not for himself, but to maintain his father\u0027s home, finding money for madam\u0027s wicked extravagance, to save his poor father pain, knowing that the old man had already more than he could bear. At Mr. Richard\u0027s age, he ought, before this, to have been making a home and marrying: he would have done so under happier circumstances: but he has had to sacrifice himself to others. He has done more for the men than they think for; ay, even at the time that they were bringing ruin upon him--as they have done--and ever since. Richard North is worth his weight in gold. Heaven, that sees all, knows that he is; and he will sometime surely be rewarded for it. It may not be in this world, my dear; for a great many of God\u0027s own best people go down to their very graves in nothing but disappointment and sorrow: but he\u0027ll find it in the next.\" Miss Dallory made no reply. All she said was, that she must go. And Mrs. Gass escorted her to the front-door. They had almost reached it, when Miss Dallory stopped to ask a question, lowering her voice as she did so. \"Have you heard any rumour about Dr. Rane?\" Mrs. Gass knew what must be meant as certainly as though it had been spoken. She turned cold, and hot, and cold again. For once language failed her. \"It is something very dreadful,\" continued Miss Dallory. \"I do not like to give utterance to it. It--it has frightened me.\" \"Law, my dear, don\u0027t pay no attention to such rubbish as rumours,\" returned Mrs. Gass, heartily. \"I don\u0027t. Folk say all sorts of things of me, I make little doubt; just as they are ready to do of other people. Let \u0027em! We shan\u0027t sleep none the worse for it. Goodbye. I wish you\u0027d have stayed and taken some dinner with me--as lovely a turkey-poult as ever you saw, and a jam dumpling.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2687/73999.html","bookId":1481,"book":{"id":1481,"title":"Bessy Rane","description":"简介： It was an intensely dark night.
