{"id":28659,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER X. A LAST PROPOSAL","content":"Affairs grew more unsatisfactory at Dallory as the weeks went on. The strike continued; the men utterly refusing to return to work except on their own terms, or, rather, the Trades\u0027 union refusing to allow them to do so. Supplies became more scanty. If not actual famine, something near to it began to reign. North Inlet, once so prosperous, looked like a half-starved place out at elbows. Oh, what senseless folly it was! What would it end in? Mrs. Gass had grown tired of going amongst the men to reason with them and try to bring them to their senses; but Miss Dallory still went. Miss Dallory could make no impression whatever. The men were moody, miserable, almost starved. They would gladly have gone back to work again almost on no pay at all, only as a relief to the present idleness; but they belonged to the famous Trades\u0027 union now, and must obey its dictates. Mary Dallory grew angry sometimes, and asked whether they were men, or cravens, that they had no pity for their poor helpless children. \n \n One day Mrs. Gass and Miss Dallory went forth together. Not of premeditation. One of Ketler\u0027s children was ill and weakly, incipient consumption, Dr. Rane said; she was a sweet little child, mild and gentle; and Miss Dallory would sometimes carry her strengthening things. It was a terrible shame, she would tell Ketler, that he should let even this poor sickly child starve: and Ketler humbly acknowledged to his own heart that the child was starving; and felt it keenly. The man was as well-meaning a man as Heaven ever sent into the world; anxious to do his duty: but he had signed himself a member of the Trades\u0027 union, and was helpless. \n \n Miss Dallory wore a print gown, and was altogether a great deal less fine than Jelly. She carried a small basket in her hand, containing fresh eggs. As she passed Mrs. Gass\u0027s that lady was standing at her open parlour window, in all the glory of a gorgeous green satin robe, and white bonnet with bird-of-paradise feather. She dearly loved fine clothes, and saw no reason why she should not wear them. \n \n \"Where be you bound to, my dear?\" asked the grandly-dressed lady, as Mary stopped. \n \n \"I am taking these eggs to little Cissy Ketler. Mrs. Gass, what is to become of all the poor children if this state of things should last much longer?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know. It goes again\u0027 the grain to see \u0027em want; but when we give \u0027em food or helps it\u0027s just so much premium offered to the father\u0027s incorrigible obstinacy and idleness, my dear.\" \n \n \"But the child is ill,\" said Mary Dallory. \"And so are many other children.\" \n \n \"They\u0027ll be worse before long. My dear, I was not talking at you, in saying that. But I don\u0027t see where it\u0027s all to end. We can\u0027t set up hospitals for the women and children, even with the best will to do it. And the will, I, for one, have not. Once get their wives and children took care of, and the men would lead the lives of gentlemen to the end o\u0027 the chapter. Here; I\u0027ll walk with you, my dear; and we can talk going along.\" \n \n She came forth, drawing on her lemon-coloured gloves: and they went towards Ketler\u0027s. North Inlet looked deserted to-day. Not a man was lounging in it. The few stragglers to be seen were walking briskly in the direction of the works; as if they had business on hand, and were without their pipes. Mrs. Gass arrested one who was passing her. \n \n \"What\u0027s up, Dawson?\" \n \n \"We\u0027ve been called together, ma\u0027am, to meet Mr. Richard North. He have som\u0027at to say to us. Happen, maybe, he\u0027s a-going to give in at last.\" \n \n \"Is he!\" retorted Mrs. Gass. \"I don\u0027t think you need worrit your inside with that idea, Dawson. It\u0027s a deal more likely that he\u0027s going to warn you he\u0027ll sell the works out and out--if he can get any fool to buy \u0027em.\" \n \n The man passed on. Mrs. Gass, as she turned to Miss Dallory, gave a flourish with her small white lace parasol and a toss to the bird-of-paradise. \n \n \"Had anybody told me men could be so obstinate, in regard to thinking themselves in the right, I\u0027d never have believed it: but seeing\u0027s believing. My dear, suppose we just step on to the works, and learn what matter Mr. Richard has in hand.\" \n \n The men, going in at the iron gates, branched round to their own entrance. Mrs. Gass took Miss Dallory to a private one. It led at once into what might now be called the audience chamber, for Richard North was already haranguing the men in it: a long and rather narrow room, with a counter running across it. It used to be the pay-room of the men: perhaps some of them, entering now, recalled those prosperous days with a sigh. Richard North did not see the ladies come in. He stood with his back to them, in his usual everyday attire, a plain black frock-coat and grey trousers. His hands rested on the counter as he talked to the men, who faced him on the other side; a crowd of them, all with attentive countenances. Mrs. Gass signed to Miss Dallory to halt; not to conceal themselves from Richard, but simply lest their advance should interrupt what he was saying. And so they remained listening, Richard unconscious that he had any other audience than his workpeople. \n \n The matter was this. A contract had just been offered to North and Gass. It was a very large one, and would certainly, if accepted, keep the men employed for some time. It was offered at a certain price. Richard North made his calculations and found that he could accept it, provided the men would work on the former terms: but he could not if the rate of wages had to be raised. Considering the present hopeless condition of the men, imagining that they must have had very nearly sufficient experience of idleness and empty cupboards to bring them to reason, he determined to lay the proposal before them--that they might accept or reject it. In a clear and concise manner he stated this, and the men heard him respectfully to the end. One of them then advanced a few steps before the rest, and answered. Answered without the smallest deliberation; without so much as a pretence of inquiring what the feelings of his fellows might be. \n \n \"We can\u0027t do it, sir.\" \n \n Richard North raised his hand for silence, as if the man had spoken before his time. \n \n \"Do you fully understand the case in all its bearings?\" resumed Richard: \"if not, take time to reflect until you do understand it. Look at it well; take into consideration the future as well as the present. Listen again. This contract has been offered me: it is a good one, as you must know. It will set our works going again; it will be the means of bringing back the business that seems to be drifting more hopelessly away from us day by day. It will provide you with, employment, with wages that you not so long ago thought liberal; and will place you again in what may be called prosperity--great prosperity as compared with what exists at present. Your homes may be homes of plenty again, your children have sufficient food. In short, both to you and to me, this contract offers just the turn of the tide. I wish to accept it: I see nothing but ruin before my father and myself if I cannot do so: what I see before you I do not care to speak of, if you are not wise enough to see it for yourselves. The decision lies with you, unfortunately; I wish it lay with myself. Shall I take it, or shall I not?\" \n \n \"We couldn\u0027t return at them rate of wages, nohow,\" spoke up a voice from the crowd. \n \n \"It is the last chance that I shall offer you,\" proceeded Richard. \"For your sakes I would strongly advise you to take it. Heaven is my witness that I am honest in saying \u0027for your sakes.\u0027 We have been associated together for many years, and I cannot see the breaking up of old ties without first using every effort to re-unite them. I must give my answer tomorrow, and accept this work or reject it. Little time is allowed me for decision, therefore I am unable to give much to you. Virtually the acceptance or rejection lies with you; for, without you, I could not fulfil it: but I cannot help a remark in passing, that for such a state of things to exist argues something rotten at the core in the relations between master and men. At six o\u0027clock tomorrow morning the great bell shall be rung, calling you to work as formerly. My men, I hope you will all respond to it.\" \n \n No, not at the terms offered, was the answer gathered by Richard North from the buzz that rose around. \n \n \"I cannot offer you better. I have said that this is the last chance,\" repeated Richard. \"I shall never give you the option of working for me again.\" \n \n The men couldn\u0027t help that. The fact was, they only half believed it. One ventured a supposition that if the works were sold, the new firm might give them work on new terms. \n \n \"No,\" said Richard North. \"I am very different from you, my men. You see work at your very hand, and will not do it. You look forward to the future with, as I must suppose, easy apathy, giving neither care nor anxiety as to how you and your families are to live. I, on the contrary, am only anxious to work; at a reduced rate of profit, on a smaller scale if it must be; but, any way, to work. Night after night I lie awake, tormented with lively apprehensions for the future. What seemed, when you first turned out, to be a mere temporary stoppage, that reason and good sense on both our sides could not fail to rectify, has assumed gigantic proportions and a permanent aspect. After some time I gave way; offering to split the difference, as to wages, if you would return----\" \n \n \"But we wanted the whole,\" came an interruption. \"And you didn\u0027t give way as to time.\" \n \n \"I could not do either,\" said Richard North firmly. \"I offered all I was able. That is a thing of the past: let it go. I now make you this last and final offer; and I think it only fair to tell you what my course will be if you reject it. I shall go over to Belgium and see if I cannot engage Belgian workmen to come here and take your places.\" \n \n A dead silence fell on the room. Ketler broke it. \n \n \"You\u0027d surely not do that, sir!\" \n \n \"Not do it! Why, you force it upon me. I must either get a new set of men, or give up the works entirely. As I do not feel inclined to the latter course, the former alone is open to me.\" \n \n \"We\u0027ll have none o\u0027 them Belgiums here!\" cried a threatening voice from the crowd. \n \n \"Allow me to tell you, Thoms, to tell you all, that the Belgians will not ask your leave to come,\" spoke Richard, raising his head to its full height. \"Would you act the part of dogs-in-the-manger? I offer you the work; offer it now; and I heartily wish you to accept it; but if you do not, I shall certainly endeavour to get others here who will.\" \n \n \"Who be they Belgicks that they should snatch the bread out of honest Englishmen\u0027s mouths!\" \n \n \"What are the honest Englishmen about, to give them the opportunity?\" retorted Richard. \"Listen, my men,\" he continued, as he leaned forward and raised his hand impressively. \"If you (I speak of the country collectively) refuse to work, it can practically matter very little to you whether the work goes to Belgium or elsewhere to be done, or whether strangers come and do it here. It must end in one or the other.\" \n \n \"It shan\u0027t never end in them frogs o\u0027 foreigners coming here,\" spoke Thoms again, vexed that his voice should have been recognized by Richard North. And this second interruption was hissed down by his more sensible comrades; who sharply bade him hold his tongue, and hear the master. Richard put up his hand again. \n \n \"We will take it, for the moment\u0027s argument, at what Thoms says--that strangers would not, or should not, come here. In that case the other result must happen--the work of the country would pass away from it. It has already begun to pass; you know it, my men; and so do your rulers the Trades\u0027 unions. How it affects their nerves I don\u0027t pretend to say; but, when once this tide of desolation has fairly set in as a settled result, there will not be much need of their agitation. As truly as that I live, and now stand here speaking to you, I believe this will come. In different parts of the country whole places are being dismantled--the work has left it. Do you suppose North Inlet is the only spot where the provision shops may as well be closed because the men have no longer money to spend in them? Any newspaper you take up will tell you the contrary. Read about the ship-building in the East of London; how it has gone away, and whole colonies of men are left behind starving. Gone to Scotland; to the banks of the Tyne; anywhere that men can be found to work. It is the same with other trades. Whose fault is this? Why, the men\u0027s own.\" \n \n Murmurs. \"No. No.\" \n \n \"No! Why, here\u0027s a present illustration of it. Whose fault is it that my works are shut up, and you are living in idleness--or, we\u0027ll say, starving in idleness, if you like the word better? If I am unable to take this contract now offered, and it goes elsewhere, whose doings will it be, but yours? Don\u0027t talk nonsense, my men. It is all very well to say that the Trades\u0027 unions don\u0027t allow, you to take the work. I have nothing to do with that: you and the unions may divide the responsibility between you.\" \n \n \"The fact is, sir, that we are not our own masters,\" said Ketler. \n \n \"Just so. And it seems that you cannot, or will not, emancipate yourselves from your new slavery and again become your own masters. However, I did not call you together to go over this old ground, but to lay before you the option of returning to work. You have the day to consider it. At six o\u0027clock tomorrow the call-bell will ring----\" \n \n \"\u0027Twon\u0027t be of no use ringing it, sir,\" interrupted Ketler, some sadness in his tone. \n \n \"At six o\u0027clock tomorrow morning the call-bell here will ring,\" authoritatively repeated Richard North. \"You respond to it and I shall heartily welcome you back. If you do not, my refusal must go in, and the contract will lapse from me. If we part to-day it is our final parting, for I shall at once take measures to secure a fresh set of workpeople. Though I gather but ten together at first, and the work I undertake be insignificant in proportion, I\u0027ll get them. It will be something like beginning life again: and you will have forced it on me.\" \n \n \"And of all pig-headed idiotics that mortal master ever had to deal with, sure you men are the worst!\" \n \n The undignified interruption came from Mrs. Gass. Richard looked round, in great surprise; perhaps all the greater when he also saw Miss Dallory. Mrs. Gass came forward; talking volubly; her bird-of-paradise nodding time to her words. As usual she told the men some home truths; none the less forcibly because her language was homely as their own. \n \n \"Is this true?\" asked Miss Dallory in a low tone, as Richard went back to shake hands with her. \"Shall you really reopen the works again with another set of men?\" \n \n \"Yes--if these do not return. It will be better, however quietly I may have to begin, than going out to seek my fortune in the world. At least, I have lately been thinking so.\" \n \n \"Do you think the men will return?\" \n \n \"I am afraid to give you my true opinion. It might seem like a bad omen.\" \n \n \"And now you have given it me. It is also mine. They are blind to infatuation.\" \n \n \"Not so much blind, I think, as that they are--I have just said so to them--in a state of slavery from which they dare not emancipate themselves.\" \n \n \"And who would do so--under the specious promises of the Trades\u0027 unions? Don\u0027t blame them too much, Mr. Richard North. If some strong body came down on you or me with, all sorts of agitation and golden promises for the future, we also might believe in them.\" \n \n Richard shook his head. \"Not if the strong body lived by the agitation: and took our hard-earned money to keep themselves and their golden promises going.\" \n \n Mary Dallory laughed a little. \"Shall you ring that great bell in the morning?\" \n \n \"Yes; certainly.\" \n \n \"Ah, well--the men will only laugh at you. But I dare say you can stand that. Oh dear! What need there is that the next world should be great and good, when this is so foolish a one!\" \n \n The meeting had broken up. Richard North and a few of the more intelligent of the men--those who had filled the more important posts at the works--remained talking yet together. Mrs. Gass, and Miss Dallory with her basket of fresh eggs, went away together. \n \n Women stood about with anxious faces, watching for the news. They were tired of the strike: heartsick, as some of them feelingly expressed it. Nothing teaches so well as experience: the women were as eager for the strike at one time as the men could be, believing it would bring them a tide of prosperity in its wake. They had not bargained for what it had really brought: misery, and dismantled homes, and semi-starvation. But for being obliged to keep up as others did--as we all have to do, whatever may be the life\u0027s struggles, the heart\u0027s bitter care--there were those amongst them who would have laid down to die in sheer hopelessness. \n \n Mrs. Ketler stood at her door in a tattered black net cap--the once tidy woman. She was shading the sun from her eyes as she looked out for her husband. It prevented her noticing the approach of the ladies; and when they accosted her she backed into her house in her timid way, rather startled, attempting a few words by way of apology. The little girl who was sick--a wan child of seven years old--was being nursed by one somewhat older. Miss Dallory looked round to see that there was a chair left, and took the invalid on her own lap. Almost all the available things the house once contained had been parted with; either pledged or sold. Miss Dallory gave the eggs to the mother, and a half-pint bottle of beef-tea that lay at the bottom of the basket. \n \n \"How is Cissy to-day?\" she asked tenderly of the child. \n \n \"Cissy tired,\" was the little one\u0027s answer. \n \n \"Has Cissy finished the strawberry-jam?\" \n \n Cissy nodded. \n \n \"Then let your big boy come to Ham Court for some more,\" said Miss Dallory, turning to the mother. \n \n The \"big boy\" was the eldest. He had been employed at the works, but was of course condemned to idleness like the rest. \n \n \"Aren\u0027t you pretty tired of this sort o\u0027 thing?\" demanded Mrs. Gass, who had come to an anchor on a wooden bucket turned upside-down. \n \n The woman knew what she meant by \"this sort o\u0027 thing,\" and gave a groan. It was very expressive, showing how tired she was of it, and how hopeless were any prospects of a change. \n \n \"I\u0027ve heard about the master\u0027s offer, ma\u0027am; but the men mean to reject it,\" she said. \"Smith stopped to tell me as he went by. The Lord above knows what is to become of us!\" \n \n \"If the men do reject it, they\u0027ll deserve to starve for the rest of their lives,\" retorted Mrs. Gass. \"Any way, I hope they\u0027ll have it upon their consciences for ever.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s the Trades\u0027 union,\" said the woman in a low tone, giving a frightened look around. \"The men can\u0027t do as they would.\" \n \n \"Not do as they would!\" echoed Mrs. Gass. \"Don\u0027t you pick up their folly and retail it to me again, Susan Ketler. If the men was fools enough to be drawn into joining the union at first--and I wouldn\u0027t blame \u0027em too much for that, for the best of us gets led away at times by fair promises that turn out in the end to be smoke, or worse--they ought not to be so obstinate as to keep there. Now that they\u0027ve seen what good that precious Trades\u0027 union is doing for \u0027em, and what it\u0027s likely to do, they should buckle on the armour of their common sense and leave it. Mr. Richard North has this day given them the opportunity of doing so. Every man Jack of \u0027em can go back to work tomorrow morning at the ringing of the bell: and take up again with good wages and comfort. If they refuse they\u0027ll not be so much fools as something worse, Susan Ketler: they\u0027ll be desperately wicked.\" \n \n \"They are afraid,\" murmured the woman. \"They have yielded themselves by word and bond to the union.\" \n \n \"Then let \u0027em break the bond. Don\u0027t tell me, Susan Ketler. Afraid? What of? Could the union kill them for it? Could the men be hung, drawn and quartered for leaving it? Who is the union? Giants that were born with thunderbolts and power from the Creator to control people\u0027s wills?--or just simple men like themselves: workmen too, once, some of \u0027em, if reports are true. You\u0027d better not try to come over me with your fallacies. Facts is facts. If these men chose to do it, they could send the Trades\u0027 union to the right about this very day, and return, with one accord, to work and their senses tomorrow. Who\u0027s to hinder them?\" \n \n Mrs. Ketler ventured to say no more. She only wished she dared say as much to her husband and the men. But, what with common sense, as Mrs. Gass called it, on the one side, and the Trades\u0027 union sophistries on the other, the steering in North Inlet just now was difficult in the extreme. Mrs. Gass rose from her uncomfortable seat, and departed with Miss Dallory. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2687/73985.html","bookId":1481,"book":{"id":1481,"title":"Bessy Rane","description":"简介： It was an intensely dark night.
