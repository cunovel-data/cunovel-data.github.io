{"id":28680,"no":44,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI. DISTURBING THE GRAVE","content":"By twos and threes, by fours and fives and tens, the curious and excited groups were wending their way towards Dallory churchyard. For a certain work was going on there, which had never been performed in it within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. \n \n Richard North was lying incapacitated at Dallory Hall. When Mr. Seeley--assisted by Dr. Rane, who had come in--examined into his injuries at Mrs. Gass\u0027s, he pronounced them not to be of a grave character. The bullet had struck a fleshy part of the arm, and passed off from it, inflicting a wound. Care and rest only would be necessary to heal it; and the same might be said with regard to the blow on the temple. Perfect rest was essential to guard against any after consequences. Mrs. Gass wished Richard to remain at her house and be nursed there; but he thought of the trouble it would cause her regular household, and said he preferred to be taken home. Mr. Seeley continued to attend him by Richard\u0027s own wish; not Dr. Rane. The public thought the rejection of the latter significant, in spite of Richard\u0027s recent exertions to do away with any impression of his guilt. \n \n \"Absolute quiet both of body and mind,\" enjoined Mr. Seeley, not only to Richard himself but to the family and servants. \"If you have it, Mr. Richard, you will be about again in a short time: if you do not have it, I cannot answer for the result.\" \n \n But Richard North, with his good common sense, was an obedient patient. He knew how necessary it was for his business, that he should not long be laid by, and he kept as quiet as Mr. Seeley could desire. No stranger was allowed to disturb him; none of the household presumed to carry him the smallest item of public or domestic news. It was during this confinement of Richard\u0027s that Ellen Adair received her summons for departure. Her father had arrived in London, and wrote to Mrs. Cumberland--unconscious of that lady\u0027s death--begging that she and Ellen would at once join him there. He apologized for not coming to Dallory, but said that family business required his presence in London. Mr. North at first proposed to take Ellen up herself: but he was really not able to do it: and it was decided that madam\u0027s maid should attend her thither. \n \n Ellen was allowed to go in and bid goodbye to Richard before her departure. She burst into tears as she strove to thank him for his kindness. \n \n \"You must come and see papa as soon as you are well enough, Richard. When I tell him how kind you have been, he will want to see and thank you.\" \n \n \"Goodbye, my dear,\" said Richard, releasing her hand. \"I trust you will soon get up all your spirits again, now your father has come.\" \n \n She smiled faintly. It was not on her father--so imperfectly, if at all, remembered--that her spirits depended. As Ellen was passing through the hall to enter the carriage that would take her to the station, she found herself touched by madam, and drawn into the dining-room. \n \n \"You have not seemed very happy with us, Miss Adair. But I have tried to make you so.\" \n \n \"Yes, madam, I am sure you have; and I thank you,\" returned Ellen gratefully--for madam really did appear to have been very kind to her of late. \"I trust papa will have an opportunity of thanking you and Mr. North personally.\" \n \n Madam coughed. \"If you think I deserve thanks, I wish you would do me a slight favour in return.\" \n \n \"If I can. Certainly.\" \n \n \"Some years ago, when we were in India,\" proceeded madam, \"my late husband, Major Bohun, and your father were acquainted with each other. Some unpleasant circumstances took place between them: a quarrel in fact. Major Bohun considered he was injured; Mr. Adair thought it was himself who was so. It was altogether very painful, and I would not for the world have that old matter raked up again; it would cost me too much pain. Will you, then, guard from Mr. Adair\u0027s knowledge that I, Mrs. North, am she who was once Mrs. Bohun?\" \n \n \"Yes, I will,\" said Ellen, in the impulse of the moment, without pausing to consider whether circumstances would allow her to do so. \n \n \"You promise me this?\" \n \n \"Yes, certainly. I will never speak of it to him, madam.\" \n \n \"Thank you, my dear.\" And madam kissed her, and led her out to the carriage. \n \n Day by day Richard North never failed to question the surgeon as to whether anything fresh was arising in regard to the accusation against Dr. Rane. The answer was invariably No. In point of fact, Mr. Seeley, not hearing more of it himself, supposed there was not; and at length, partly in good faith, partly to calm his patient, who was restless on the subject, he said it had dropped through altogether. \n \n But the surgeon was wrong. During Richard\u0027s active opposition, madam had found her power somewhat crippled; she scarcely deemed it might be altogether to her own interest at the Hall to set him at defiance; but the moment he was laid up, she was at work again more actively than ever. It was nothing but providential, madam considered, that Richard had been put out of the way for a time: and could madam have released Poole from the consequences of his act, and sent him on his road rewarded, she had certainly done it. She gained her point. Poor Mrs. Rane was to be taken up from her grave. \n \n Dale, who had it in hand, went about the proceedings as quietly and secretly as possible. He was sorry to have to do it, for he bore no ill-will to Richard North, but the contrary, and he knew how anxious he was that this should not be done; whilst at the same time the lawyer hated madam. But, he had no alternative: he had received his orders, as coroner, to call an inquest, and could not evade it. He issued his instructions in private, strictly charging the few who must act, to keep silence abroad. And not a syllable transpired beforehand. \n \n The work was commenced in the darkness of the winter\u0027s morning. By ten o\u0027clock, however, the men had been seen in the churchyard, and secrecy was no longer possible. The news ran like wildfire to all parts of Dallory--Mrs. Rane was being taken up. Never had there been such excitement as this. The street was in an uproar, windows were alive with heads: had Dallory suddenly found itself invaded by a destroying army, the commotion could not have been greater. \n \n Then began the exodus to the churchyard. Mr. Dale had foreseen this probability, and was prepared for it. A body of police appeared in the churchyard, and the people found they could only approach the actual spot within a very respectful distance. Resenting this, they relieved their feelings by talking the louder. \n \n Jelly was there. Never nearer losing her reason than now. Between dismay at what she had set afloat, and horror at the crime about to be revealed, Jelly was not clear whether she stood on her head or her heels. When the news was carried to her of what was going on, Jelly very nearly fainted. Now that it had come to the point, she felt that she would have given the world never to have meddled with it. It was not so much the responsibility to herself that she thought of, as the dreadful aspect of the thing altogether. She went into a violent fit of trembling, and sought her chamber to hide it. When somewhat recovered, she asked leave of Mrs. Beverage to be allowed to go out for a few hours. To have been compelled to remain indoors would have driven her quite mad. The morning was growing late when Jelly arrived at the scene, and the first person she specially noticed there was Mrs. Gass. \n \n But Mrs. Gass had not come forth in idle curiosity as most others had done--and there were some of the better classes amongst the mob. Mrs. Gass was inexpressibly shocked and dismayed that it should really have come to this. Oliver Rane was her late husband\u0027s nephew; she did not think he could have been guilty: and she had hastened to see whether any argument or persuasion might avail at the twelfth hour, to arrest proceedings and spare disgrace to the North and Gass families. \n \n But no. Stepping over the barrier-line the police had drawn, without the smallest regard to the remonstrance of a red-faced inspector, who was directing things, Mrs. Gass approached the small throng around the grave. She might have spared herself the pains. In answer to her urgent appeal she was told that no one here had any power now; it had passed out of their hands. In returning, Mrs. Gass encountered Jelly. \n \n \"Well,\" said she, regarding Jelly sternly, \"be you satisfied with your work?\" \n \n Jelly never answered. In her shame, her regret, her humiliation at what she had done, she could almost have wished herself labouring at the treadmill that had so long haunted her dreams. \n \n \"Anyway, you might have had the decency to keep away,\" went on Mrs. Gass. \n \n \"I couldn\u0027t,\" said Jelly, meekly. \"I couldn\u0027t stop at home and bear it.\" \n \n \"Then I\u0027d have gone a mile or two the other way,\" retorted Mrs. Gass. \"You must be quite brazen, to show your face here. And you must have a conscience too.\" \n \n A frightful noise interrupted them: a suppressed shout of horror. The heavy coffin was at length deposited on the ground with the pick-axes beside it, and the populace were expressing their mixed sentiments at the sight: some in applause at this great advance in the show: others in a groan meant for Dr. Rane, who had caused it all. Mrs. Gass, what with the yelling, the coffin and pick-axes, and the crush, had never felt so humiliated in all her days; and she retired behind a remote tree to hide her emotion. \n \n At that moment Thomas Hepburn appeared in sight, his face sad and pale. \n \n \"Hepburn,\" said Mrs. Gass, \"I can\u0027t think they\u0027ll find anything wrong there. My belief is she died naturally. Unless there were better grounds to go upon than I know of, they ought not to have gone to this shameful length.\" \n \n \"Ma\u0027am, I don\u0027t think it, either,\" assented the man. \"I\u0027m sure it has been more like a dream to me than anything else, since I heard it. Folks say it is madam at the Hall that has forced it on.\" \n \n Had Mrs. Gass been a man, she might have felt tempted to give madam a very strong word. What right had she, in her wicked malice, to inflict this pain on others? \n \n \"Whatever may be the upshot of this, Thomas Hepburn, it will come home to her as sure as that we two are talking here. What are you going there for?\" added Mrs. Gass, for he was preparing to make his way towards the grave. \n \n \"I\u0027ve had orders to be here, ma\u0027am. Some of those law officials don\u0027t understand this sort of work as well as I do.\" \n \n He crossed over, the police making way for him, Inspector Jekyll giving him a nod. Jelly was standing against a tree not far from Mrs. Gass, straining her eyes upon the scene. By the eagerness displayed by the crowd, it might have been supposed they thought that they had only to see the face of the dead, lying within, to have all suspicion of Dr. Rane turned into fact. \n \n The work went on. The leaden covering came off amidst a tumult, and the common deal shell alone remained. \n \n It was at this juncture that another spectator came slowly up. The mob, their excited faces turned to the grave and to Thomas Hepburn, who was already at his work, did not see his approach. Perhaps it was as well: for the new arrival was Dr. Rane. \n \n Even from him had these proceedings been kept secret; perhaps especially from him: and it was only now, upon coming forth to visit a patient in Dallory, that he learnt what was taking place in the churchyard. He came to it at once: his countenance stern, his face white as death. \n \n Mrs. Gass saw him; Jelly also. Mrs. Gass silently moved to prevent his further approach, spreading her portly black silk skirts. Her intentions were good. \n \n \"Go back,\" she whispered. \"Steal away before you are seen. Look at this unruly mob. They might tear you to pieces, doctor, in the humour they are in.\" \n \n \"Let them--when I have stopped that,\" he recklessly answered, pointing to what Thomas Hepburn was doing. \n \n \"You are mad,\" cried Mrs. Gass in excitement. \"Stop that! Why, sir, how impossible it would be, even with the best wish, to stop it now. A nail or two more, sir, and the lid\u0027s off.\" \n \n It was as she said. Dr. Rane saw it. He took out his handkerchief, and passed it over his damp face. \n \n \"Richard North gave me his word that he would stop it, if it came to this,\" he murmured more to himself than to Mrs. Gass. \n \n \"Richard North knows no more of this than it seems, you knew of it,\" she said. \"He is shut up in his room at the Hall, and hears nothing. Doctor, take advice and get away,\" she whispered imploringly. \"There\u0027s still time.\" \n \n \"No,\" he doggedly said. \"As it has gone so far, I\u0027ll stand my ground now.\" \n \n Mrs. Gass groaned. The sound was lost in a rush--police contending against King Mob, King Mob against the police. Even Mrs. Gass turned pale. Dr. Rane voluntarily arrested his advancing steps. Jelly\u0027s troubled face was peering out from the distant tree. \n \n The lid had been lifted, and the open shell stood exposed. It was more than the excited numbers could witness, and be quiet. Inspector Jekyll and his fellows keep them back from looking into it? Never. A short, sharp struggle, and the police and their staves were nowhere. With a triumphant whoop the crowd advanced. \n \n But a strange hush, apparently of consternation, had fallen on those who stood at the grave; a hush fell on these interlopers as they reached it. The coffin was empty. \n \n Of all unexpected stoppages to proceedings, official or otherwise, one more complete than this had never fallen. An old magistrate who was present, the coroner--who had just come striding over the ground, to see how things were going on--Thomas Hepburn, and others generally, stared at the empty coffin in profound perplexity. \n \n And the mob, when it had duly stared also, elbowing each other in the process,18 and fighting ruefully for precedence, burst out into a howl. Not at all a complimentary one to Dr. Rane. \n \n He had sold her for dissection! He had never put her in at all! He had had a sham funeral! \u0027Twasn\u0027t enough to poison of her, but he must sell her afterwards! \n \n To accuse a man of those heinous offences behind his back, is one thing, but it is not felt to be quite so convenient to do it in his presence. The sight of Dr. Rane walking calmly, not to say impudently, across the churchyard into their very midst, struck a certain timidity on the spirits of the roarers. Silence ensued. They even parted to allow him to pass. Dr. Rane threw his glance on the empty coffin, and then on those who stood around it. \n \n \"Well,\" said he, \"why don\u0027t you take me?\" \n \n And not a soul ventured to reply. \n \n \"I have murdered my wife, have I? If I have done so, why, you know I deserve no quarter. Come, Mr. Coroner, why don\u0027t you issue your orders to arrest me? You have your officers at hand.\" \n \n The independence with which this was spoken, the freedom of Dr. Rane\u0027s demeanour, the mockery of his tone, could not be surpassed. He had the best of it now; might say what he pleased, and laugh derisively at them at will: and they knew it. Even Dale, the coroner, felt small--which is saying a good deal of a lawyer. \n \n Turning round, the doctor walked slowly back again, his head in the air. Mrs. Gass met him. \n \n \"Tell me the truth for the love of goodness, doctor. I have never believed it of you. You did not help her to her death?\" \n \n \"Help her to her death?\" he retorted. \"No: my wife was too dear to me for that. I\u0027d have killed the whole world rather than her--if it must have come to killing at all.\" \n \n \"And I believe you,\" was the hearty response. \"And I have told everybody, from the first, that the charge was wicked and preposterous.\" \n \n \"Thank you, Mrs. Gass.\" \n \n He broke away from any further questions she might have put, and stalked on towards Dallory, coolly saying that he had a patient to see. \n \n As to the crowd, they really did not know what to make of it: it was a shameful cheat. The small staff of officials, including the police, seemed to know as little. To be enabled to take Oliver Rane into custody for poisoning his wife they must first find the wife, and ascertain whether she really had been poisoned. Lawyer Dale had never met with so bewildering a check in the long course of his practice; the red-faced Inspector stroked his chin, and the old magistrate clearly had not recovered his proper mind yet. \n \n By the appearance of the shell, it seemed evident that the body had never been there at all. What had he done with it?--where could he have hidden it? A thought crossed Mr. Jekyll, experienced in crime, that the doctor might have concealed it in his house--or buried it in his garden. \n \n \"How was it you did not feel the lightness of the shell when you put it into the lead, you and your men?\" asked the Inspector, turning sharply upon Thomas Hepburn. \n \n \"We did not do it,\" was the undertaker\u0027s answer. \"Dr. Rane undertook that himself, on account of the danger of infection. We went and soldered the lead down, but it was all ready for us.\" \n \n A clearer proof of guilt, than this fact conveyed, could not well be found: as they all murmured one to another. The old magistrate rubbed up his hair, as if by that means he could also rub up his intellect. \n \n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" he said, still bewildered. \"Why should he have kept her out of the coffin? If he did what was wrong--surely to bury her out of sight would be the safest place to hide away his crime. What do you think about it, Jekyll?\" \n \n \"Well, your worship, I can only think that he might have feared some such proceeding as this, and so secured himself against it,\" was the Inspector\u0027s answer. \"I don\u0027t know, of course: it is only an idea.\" \n \n \"But where is the body, Jekyll?\" persisted the magistrate. \"What could he have done with it?\" \n \n \"It must be our business to find out, your worship.\" \n \n \"Did he cut her up?\" demanded the mob. For which interruption they were chased backwards by the army of discomfited policemen. \n \n \"She may be about his premises still, your worship,\" said the Inspector, hazarding the opinion. \"If so, I should say she is lying a few feet below the surface somewhere in the garden.\" \n \n \"Bless my heart, what a frightful thing!\" cried his worship. \"And about this? What is going to be done?\" \n \n He pointed to the coffins and the open grave. Yes: what was to be done? Lawyer Dale searched his legal memory and could not remember any precedent to guide him. A short counsel was held. \n \n \"When her bones is found, poor lady, they\u0027ll want Chris\u0027an bur\u0027al: as good let the grave lie open,\" interposed one of the grave-diggers respectfully--who no doubt wished to be spared the present labour of filling-in the earth. To which opinion the gentlemen, consulting there, condescended to listen. \n \n And, finally, that course was decided upon: Thomas Hepburn being requested to have the coffins removed to his place, pending inquiry. And the gentlemen dispersed, and the mob after them. \n \n A very dissatisfied mob tramping out of the churchyard. They seldom had much pleasure now, poor things, in their enforced idleness and starvation: and to be balked in this way was about as mortifying a termination to the day as could have happened. Only one greater evil could be imagined--and that was a possibility not to be glanced at: that it should have been discovered that poor Mrs. Rane had died a natural death. \n \n The last person left in the churchyard--excepting a man or two who remained to guard the coffins, whilst means were being brought to take them away--was Jelly. To watch Jelly\u0027s countenance when the empty shell stood revealed, was as good as a play. The jaw dropped, the eyes were strained. It was worse than even Jelly had supposed, Dr. Rane a greater villain. Not content with taking his wife\u0027s life, he had also made away with her body. Whether he had disposed of it in the manner affirmed by the mob, in that suggested by the Inspector, or in any other way, the doctor must be one of the most hardened criminals breathing--his brazen demeanour just now in the graveyard was alone sufficient evidence of that. And now the trouble was no nearer being brought to light than before, and Jelly almost wished, as she had wished many a time lately, that she might die. Hiding from the spectators stood she, her heart faint within her. When the echoes of the tramping mob had died away in the distance, Jelly turned to depart also, drawing her black shawl around her with a shudder. \n \n \"That\u0027s why she can\u0027t rest, poor lady; she\u0027s not laid in consecrated ground. At the worst, I never suspected this.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2687/74006.html","bookId":1481,"book":{"id":1481,"title":"Bessy Rane","description":"简介： It was an intensely dark night.
