{"id":28668,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. COMING HOME TO DIE","content":"Time went on again; nearly a fortnight. Dallory had relapsed into its old routine; the fever was forgotten. Houses had recovered from the aroma of soap and scrubbing: their inhabitants were back again; and amongst them were Mrs. North and her daughter Matilda. \n \n The principal news madam found to interest her was, that Richard North had opened the works again. The glow of hope it raised within her was very bright; for she considered it as an earnest that supplies would spring up again in the future as they had in the past. That she would find herself mistaken was exceedingly probable; Richard himself could have said a certainty. Madam had the grace to express some calm regret for the untimely death of Bessy Rane, in the hearing of Mr. North and Richard; she had put herself and Matilda into deeper mourning than they had assumed for James Bohun. It was all of the most fashionable and costly description; and the master of Dallory Hall, poor helpless man, had the pleasure of receiving the bills for it from the London court-milliners and dressmakers. But madam never inquired into the particulars of Bessy\u0027s illness and death; in her opinion the less fevers were talked about the better. \n \n Yes: the North works were reopened. Or, to be quite correct, they were on the point of being reopened. Upon how small a scale he must begin again, Richard, remembering the extent of past operations, felt almost ashamed to contemplate. But, as he good-humouredly remarked, half a loaf was better than no bread. He must earn a living; he had no fortune to fly to; and he preferred doing this to seeking employment under other firms, if indeed anything worth having could have been found; but the trade of the country was in a most depressed state, and hundreds of gentlemen, like himself, had been thrown on their beam ends. It was the same thing as beginning life over again; a little venture, that might succeed or might fail; one in which he must plod on carefully and cautiously, even to keep it going. \n \n The whole staff of operatives would at first number less than twenty. The old workmen, idly airing themselves still in North Inlet, laughed derisively when they heard this. They were pleasantly sarcastic over it, thinking perhaps to conceal their real bitterness of heart. The new measure did not find favour with them. How should it, when they stood out in the light of exclusion? Some eight or ten, who had never willingly upheld the strike, had all along been ready to return to work, would be taken on again; the rest were foreigners that Richard North was bringing over from abroad. And the anger of the disaffected may be imagined. \n \n Mrs. Gass entered cordially into Richard\u0027s plans. She would have put unlimited money into his new undertaking; but Richard would not have it. Some portion of her capital that had been embarked in the firm of North and Gass, of necessity remained in it--all, in fact, that was not lost--but this she counted as nothing, and wanted to help Richard yet further. \"It\u0027s of no good crying over spilt milk, Mr. Richard,\" she said to him, philosophically; \"and I\u0027ve still a great deal more than I shall ever want.\" But Richard was firm: he would receive no further help: it was a risk that he preferred to incur alone. \n \n Perhaps there were few people living that Richard North liked better than Mrs. Gass. He even liked her homely language; it was honest and genuine; far more to be respected than if she had made a show of attempting what she could not have kept up. Richard had learned to know her worth: he recognized it more certainly day by day. In the discomfort of his home at Dallory Hall--which had long been anything but a home to him--he had fallen into the habit of almost making a second home with Mrs. Gass. Never a day passed but he spent an hour or two of it with her; and she would persuade him to remain for a meal as often as she could. \n \n He sat one afternoon at her well-spread tea-table. His arrangements were very nearly organized now; and in a day the works would open. The foreign workmen had arrived, and were lodging with their families in the places appointed for them. Two policemen, employed by Richard, had also taken up their position in Dallory, purposely to protect them. Of course their mission was not known: Richard North would not be the one to provoke hostilities; but he was quite aware of the ill-feeling obtaining amongst his former workmen. \n \n \"Downright idiots, they be,\" said Mrs. Gass, confidentially, as she handed Richard a cup of tea. \"They want a lesson read to \u0027em, Mr. Richard; that\u0027s what it is.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" dissented Richard. \"It seems to me they could hardly receive a better lesson than these last few months must have taught them.\" \n \n \"Ah, you don\u0027t know \u0027em as I do. I\u0027m almost double your age, sir; and there\u0027s nothing gives experience like years.\" \n \n Richard laughed. \"Not double my age yet, Mrs. Gass.\" \n \n \"Anyway, I might have been your mother--if you\u0027ll excuse my saying it,\" she contended. \"You\u0027re hard upon thirty-three, and I\u0027m two years turned fifty.\" \n \n In this homely manner Mrs. Gass usually liked to make her propositions undeniable. Certainly she might, in point of age, have been Richard\u0027s mother. \n \n \"I know the men better than you do, Mr. Richard; and I say they want a lesson read to \u0027em yet. And they\u0027ll get it, sir. But we\u0027ll leave the subject for a bit, if you please. I\u0027ve been tired of it for some time past, and I\u0027m sure you have. To watch once sensible men acting like fools, and persisting in doing it, in spite of everybody and everything, wearies one\u0027s patience. Is it tomorrow that you open?\" \n \n \"The day after.\" \n \n \"Well, now, Mr. Richard, I should like to say another word upon a matter that you and me don\u0027t agree on--and it\u0027s not often our opinions differ, is it, sir? It\u0027s touching your capital. I know you\u0027ll want more than you can command: it would give me a real pleasure if you\u0027ll let me find it.\" \n \n Richard smiled, and shook his head, \"I cannot say more than I have said before,\" was his reply. \"You know all I have urged.\" \n \n \"Promise me this, then,\" returned Mrs. Gass. \"If ever you find yourself at a pinch as things go on, you\u0027ll come to me. I don\u0027t ask this, should the concern turn out a losing one, for in that case I know cords wouldn\u0027t draw you to me for help. But when you are getting on, and money would be useful, and its investment safe and sure, I shall expect you to come to me. Now, that\u0027s enough. I want to put a question, Mr. Richard, that delicacy has kept me from worrying you about before. What about the expenses at Dallory Hall? You can\u0027t pretend to keep \u0027em up yourself.\" \n \n \"Ah,\" said Richard, \"that has been my nightmare. But I think I see a way through it at last. First of all, I have given notice to Miss Dallory that we shall not renew the lease: it will expire, you know, next March.\" \n \n \"Good,\" observed Mrs. Gass. \n \n \"My father knows nothing about it--it is of no use troubling him earlier than is necessary; and of course madam knows nothing. She imagines that the lease will be renewed as a matter of course. Miss Dallory will, at my request, keep counsel--or, rather, her brother Francis for her, for it is he who transacts her business.\" \n \n \"They know then that you are the real lessee of Dallory Hall? Lawk a mercy, what a simpleton I am!\" broke off Mrs. Gass. \"Of course they must have known it when the transfer was made.\" \n \n Richard nodded. \"As soon as Christmas is turned I shall look out for a moderate house in lieu of the Hall; one that I shall hope to be able to keep up. It shall have a good garden for my father\u0027s sake. There will be rebellion on the part of madam and Matilda, but I can\u0027t help that. I cannot do more than my means will allow me.\" \n \n \"See here, Mr. Richard; don\u0027t worry yourself about not being able to keep up a house for Mr. North. I\u0027ll do my part in that: do it all, if need be. He and my husband were partners and friends, and grew rich together. Mr. North has lost his savings, but I have kept mine; and I will never see him wanting comfort while he lives. We\u0027ll look out for a pretty villa with a lovely garden; and he\u0027ll be happier in it than he has ever been in that grand Hall. If madam doesn\u0027t like to bring her pride down to it, let her go off elsewhere--and a good riddance of bad rubbish.--Mr. Richard, have you heard the news about Mary Dallory?\" \n \n \"What news?\" he asked. \n \n \"That she\u0027s going to be married to Captain Bohun.\" \n \n Richard North drank his tea to the dregs. His face had flushed a little. \n \n \"I hear that madam wishes it, and is working for it,\" he answered. \"Miss Dallory was staying with them when they were at Sir Nash Bohun\u0027s.\" \n \n \"I know madam has given it out that they\u0027re going to marry,\" rejoined Mrs. Gass. \"By the way, Mr. Richard, how is Captain Bohun getting on, after his illness?\" \n \n \"He is better. Almost well.\" \n \n Mrs. Gass helped herself to some buttered toast. \"I shall believe in that marriage when it has taken place, Mr. Richard; not before. Unless I am uncommonly out, Captain Bohun cares for another young lady too well to think of Mary Dallory. Folks mayn\u0027t suspect it; and I believe don\u0027t. But I have had my eyes about me.\" \n \n Richard knew that she alluded to Ellen Adair. \n \n \"They are both as sweet and good girls as ever lived, and a gentleman may think himself lucky to get either of \u0027em. Mr. Richard, your coat-sleeve is coming into contact with the potted-ham.\" \n \n Richard smiled a little as he attended to his cuff. Mourning was always bad wearing, he remarked, and showed every little stain. And then he said a few words about her for whom it was worn. He had rarely alluded to the subject since she died. \n \n \"I cannot grow reconciled to her loss,\" he said in low tones. \"At times can scarcely believe in it. To have been carried off after only a day\u0027s fever seems to me incredible.\" \n \n And Mrs. Gass felt that the words startled her to pallor. She turned away lest he should see the change in her countenance. \n \n Bad news arrived from Mrs. Cumberland. Only a morning or two later, a loud knock at the front-door disturbed Jelly and Dinah at their breakfast. Upon its being opened by the latter, Dr. Rane walked straight into the kitchen without ceremony, an open letter in his hand. Jelly rose and curtsied. She had been markedly respectful to the doctor of late, perhaps in very fear lest he should suspect the curious things that were troubling her mind. \n \n \"My mother will be home to-night, Jelly.\" \n \n \"To-night, sir!\" exclaimed Jelly in her surprise. \n \n \"She is much worse. Very ill indeed. She says she is coming home to die.\" \n \n Jelly was startled out of her equanimity. \n \n \"It is only three lines, and she writes herself,\" continued Dr. Rane, just showing the letter in his hand, as if in confirmation. \"They were to go to London yesterday, remain there the night, and will come home to-day. Of course you will have everything in readiness.\" \n \n \"Yes, sir. And what about meeting my mistress at the station?\" \n \n \"I shall go myself,\" said Dr. Rane. \n \n He went away with the last words. Jelly sat still for a few minutes to digest the news, and came to the conclusion that \"coming home to die\" was a mere figure of speech of Mrs. Cumberland\u0027s. Then she rose up to begin her preparations, and overwhelmed and bewildered Dinah with a multitude of orders. \n \n During the day, Jelly, in pursuance of something or other she wanted, was walking quickly towards Dallory, when in passing the Hall gates she found herself accosted by Mrs. North. Madam was taking her usual promenade in the grounds, and had extended it to the gates. Jelly stood still in sheer amazement; it was the first time within her recollection that madam had condescended to address her or any other inhabitant of the neighbourhood. \n \n How was Mrs. Cumberland?--and where was she? madam graciously asked. And Jelly in the moment\u0027s haste, answered that she was at Eastsea. \n \n \"To stay the winter, I believe,\" went on madam. \"And Miss Adair--is she with her?\" \n \n \"I ought to have said was at Eastsea,\" corrected Jelly, who did not like madam well enough to be more than barely civil to her. \"My mistress is worse, and is coming home to-day. Miss Adair is with her of course. I must wish you good-morning, madam; I\u0027ve all my work before me to-day.\" And away went Jelly, leaving madam a mental compliment: \n \n \"Nasty proud cat! she had some sly motive for asking, I know.\" \n \n And so the day went on. \n \n The early twilight of the autumn evening was beginning to fall, together with a heavy shower of rain, when the carriage containing Mrs. Cumberland stopped at her door. Jelly ran out; and was met by Ellen Adair, who spoke in a startled whisper. \n \n \"Oh, Jelly, she is so ill! too ill to speak.\" \n \n The doctor stood helping his mother out. Ann was gathering up small articles from beside the driver. Jelly caught one glimpse of her mistress\u0027s face and fell back in alarm. Surely that look was the look of death! \n \n \"She ought not to have come,\" murmured Dr. Rane in Jelly\u0027s ear. \"Go and ask Seeley to step over--whilst I get my mother upstairs.\" \n \n There was bustle and confusion for the moment. Mrs. Cumberland was placed in the easy-chair in her room, and her bonnet and travelling wraps were removed. She refused to go to bed. In half-an-hour or so, when she had somewhat recovered the fatigue, she looked and seemed much better, and spoke a little, expressing a wish for some tea. The doctors left her to take it, enjoining strict quiet. Jelly was near her mistress, holding the cup and saucer. \n \n \"What did she die of, Jelly?\" came the unexpected question. \n \n \"Who?\" asked Jelly, wonderingly. \n \n Mrs. Cumberland motioned in the direction of her son\u0027s house: and her voice was subdued to faintness: \"Bessy Rane.\" \n \n Jelly gave a start that almost upset the teacup. She felt her face grow white; but she could not move to conceal it. \n \n \"Why don\u0027t you reply? What did she die of?\" \n \n \"Ma\u0027am, don\u0027t you know? She caught the fever.\" \n \n \"It troubles me, Jelly; it troubles me. I\u0027ve done nothing but dream about her ever since. And what will Oliver do without her?\" \n \n The best he can, Jelly had a great mind to answer. But all she said, was, to beg her mistress to leave these questions until the morning. \n \n \"I don\u0027t think any morning will dawn for me,\" was Mrs. Cumberland\u0027s remark. \"I sent you word I was coming home to die. I wanted to come for many reasons. I knew the journey would do me harm; I had put it off too long. But I had to come home: I could not die away from it.\" \n \n Every consoling thing that Jelly could think of, she said, assuring her mistress it was nothing but the journey that had brought her into this state of depression. \n \n \"I want to see Mr. North,\" resumed Mrs. Cumberland. \"You must bring him to me.\" \n \n \"Not to-night,\" said Jelly. \n \n \"To-night. At once. There is no time to be lost. To see him was one of the things I had to come home for.\" \n \n And Mrs. Cumberland, ill though she was, was as resolute in being obeyed as she had ever been in the days of her health. Jelly had the sense to know that refusal would excite her more than any result from compliance, and prepared to obey. As she passed out of the presence of Mrs. Cumberland, she saw Ellen Adair sitting on the stairs, anxiously listening for any sound from the sick-room that might tell how all was going on within it. \n \n \"Oh, Miss Ellen! You should not be there.\" \n \n \"I cannot rest anywhere, Jelly. I want to know how she is. She is my only friend on this side of the wide world.\" \n \n \"Well now, Miss Ellen, look here--you may come in and stay with her, whilst I am away: I was going to call Ann. But mind you don\u0027t talk to her.\" \n \n Hastily throwing on a shawl, Jelly started for Dallory Hall. It was an inclement night, pouring with rain. And Ellen Adair took up her place in silence by the side of the dying woman--for she was dying, however ignorant they might be of the fact. Apart from Ellen\u0027s natural grief for Mrs. Cumberland, thoughts of what her own situation would be, if she lost her, could but intrude on her mind, bringing all sorts of perplexity with them. It seemed to her that she would be left without home or protector in the wide world. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2687/73994.html","bookId":1481,"book":{"id":1481,"title":"Bessy Rane","description":"简介： It was an intensely dark night.
