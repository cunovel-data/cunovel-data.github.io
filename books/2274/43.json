Can you think of anything that might help?”\n The big man shook his head. “I’m trying. I knew someone was after Emil Landon, and I was ready to defend him. But who the hell—”\n “Wait,” Jessy said. “You said you knew that someone was after Emil. How did you know? Because he told you so?”\n “No,” Green said. “Someone shot at him one night. I wanted to call the cops, but Mr. Landon took care of it himself. He called some cop he’s kind of friends with, and after, that’s when he called Adam Harrison. He insisted on getting Dillon Wolf to find out what was going on. His friend at the station had him convinced he needed Wolf. So Wolf came on the job, but he was just investigating, we were protecting—Hugo Blythe and me. But I was off work when it happened. Was I killed so I couldn’t protect Mr. Landon?”\n “I don’t know, but I suppose it’s possible,” Jessy said.\n Green let out an aggrieved sigh.\n “Mr. Green, there’s something else. We need to know why you whispered ‘Indigo’ to me before you died.”\n 15\n Dillon awoke with a start. Despite the heavy drapes, he knew that day had come.\n He reached out in anticipation, then realized that Jessy wasn’t beside him. He jumped up and started toward the door, then realized he was naked and Adam was in the house, and went back for a robe.\n He almost called her name, but it was always better to seek someone in silence, so he hurried down the hall as quickly and quietly as he could.\n He reached the living room and stopped short in shock.\n There was Jessy, all that long red hair streaming around her face in a red halo, a stunning contrast to her navy blue T-shirt. She was holding a cup of coffee, one of her legs crossed over the other, and she was engaged in what looked to be the most casual conversation in the world.\n With three ghosts.\n Ringo, a given, was at her side. But Tanner Green was there, too, sitting in a wingback chair, his expression one of intense concentration.\n Rudy Yorba was there, too. He looked tense, standing behind Green, watching the others.\n Ringo sensed Dillon’s presence first. He interrupted Tanner Green just as he was about to speak and said, “Green, don’t you go turning into a girlie-man again and disappearing. Dillon is a longtime nightwalker, and he’s the one person here who can really help you. Stay, do you understand?”\n Startled, Green looked up at Dillon and began to fade. Dillon silently cursed himself and spoke quickly and very softly. “Please, Green, I need you. We need your help.”\n Tanner Green took what looked for all the world like a deep breath and his image stabilized.\n Next, Dillon looked across the room at Rudy. “I’m sorry,” he said.\n Rudy, to his surprise, seemed to release some of the tension that had held him so stiffly and said, “Don’t be. Not your fault.”\n “You tried to help,” Dillon reminded him.\n “I was all over those tapes. Hell, if that cop hadn’t been such a jerk, I might have talked to him right away, and then I probably would have been killed sooner. What is, is. But I want to know the truth. I want to know who did this to me, and then I want to watch the bastard fry. At the least, I want him locked up for the rest of his life, and when he is, I’m going to see to it that he doesn’t have a minute of peace for as long as he lives.”\n Jessy cleared her throat, looking at Dillon. Her eyes were bottomless pools of blue, but she was clearly doing amazingly well.\n “Dillon, I was just asking Mr. Green about Indigo,” she said.\n Dillon walked over to the couch, and Ringo moved to accommodate him as he took a seat next to Jessy.\n “Indigo might be the key to everything,” Dillon explained to Green. “We need to know what’s so important about the place.”\n “There’s gold there,” Tanner Green said.\n “How do you know that?” Dillon asked. “There’s been a legend about the gold for over a century, but are you telling me it’s real?”\n “I don’t know,” Green said, frowning as if the answer was just out of reach.\n “Let’s try this. Let’s start with the beginning of your day.”\n “It was my day off.”\n “And what were you doing on your day off?”\n “Sleeping late. I have a room up in the penthouse. Landon, he acts like a prick, but he’s pretty decent to the people who work for him. I slept until noon. Blythe was on guard duty. I don’t think he was that concerned. He didn’t really think anyone was after the boss. The shots that were fired…they might have been fired at anyone in that parking lot. Most people thought it was just a backfire, you know?”\n Dillon kept a rein on his temper. They finally had Tanner Green talking. He had to tell his story in his own time.\n “Yes, I know, but when you know the sound of a bullet, you can tell it isn’t a backfire,” Dillon said. “So then…?”\n “So then…” Green paused for thought. He seemed pleased when he spoke again. “I was hungry, so I went and got something to eat.”\n “Steak and potatoes.”\n “Yeah,” Green said. “How did you know?”\n Autopsy reports, Dillon thought, but he didn’t say so. “You just look like a meat-and-potatoes man,” he fudged.\n Green nodded again. “Then I went gambling.”\n “Where?”\n “I hit a few places.”\n “Did you gamble at the Big Easy?” Dillon asked.\n Green shook his head. “No. Can’t work there and gamble there. It’s not allowed.”\n “Okay, so where?” Dillon asked.\n “Um, I hit some of the big ones. Bally’s, Wynn, MGM.”\n “You stayed on the Strip?” Dillon asked.\n “Yeah. I think I gambled at the Sun, too,” he said, musing over his own answer. “Yeah, I was there.”\n Dillon made a mental note to check that out on the security tapes. Even if Green had been there, did it mean anything?\n “And were you drinking in the course of the day?” Dillon asked.\n “Yeah, here and there. I’m not a lush. But I did have something, and that’s when the lights I was telling Miss Sparhawk about started up and…I was playing kickball in Philly again,” Green said.\n Rudy Yorba snorted.\n “It wasn’t his fault. Someone slipped him some LSD,” Dillon said.\n “For real?” Rudy asked.\n “For real,” Dillon repeated.\n “Mr. Green, can we talk about Indigo again?” Jessy said, slipping back into the conversation.\n Dillon could feel the tension in her. He gently set a hand on her knee, a warning that they needed to be patient.\n “I was in a car—a limo, maybe—and I heard people talking about it, saying there had to be a way to find the gold, that it was really there.”\n “Who?” Dillon asked quietly.\n “I don’t know. I was there, and at the same time I wasn’t there,” Green said.\n Dillon rubbed his forehead in frustration. Green had overheard the conversation, but he’d been tripping and had no memory of the specifics.\n “Please, try to think. This is important,” Dillon said. “Do you remember being in a car?”\n “A nice car. A limo, I think.”\n “Okay, that’s good. Who else was in the car?”\n Tanner Green frowned in concentration. “Friends. I think. The kids I played kickball with.”\n Dillon leaned forward. “Tanner, you weren’t really with your friends from the old days back in Philly. It had to be someone you know from here. Think hard.”\n “I’m trying,” Green said.\n They were all startled by a cheerful whistle coming from the hall. “Good morning,” Adam Harrison said as he walked into the room, showered and dressed and ready to tackle the day.\n “No, stay!” Dillon said when Tanner looked as if he was about to disappear again. “It’s Adam, my boss, and he can’t even see you.”\n “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt,” Adam said. “I’ll be in the kitchen. You all keep talking.”\n “I need to think,” Tanner said, his image solidifying. “I need to think.”\n Dillon rose. He needed to do some thinking himself. “Rudy, go hang around the Sun and see what you can pick up. Tanner, you go back to the Big Easy and see what you can find out over there. Jessy, we need to go see your grandfather.”\n “Gotcha,” Rudy said, nodding.\n “I’m off, then,” Green said.\n “I’m going to take a shower,” Jessy said to Dillon. “You can go fill Adam in.”\n Nikki and Brent met them at the home, and Timothy was delighted with the extra company. He and Brent talked for several minutes about the old ways, and it made Jessy smile to see Timothy so happy.\n She was embarrassed when Sandra called and she realized that she had forgotten to call her friend that morning to assure her that everything was all right. She stepped out into the hall and told Sandra that some friends of Dillon’s were in town, and said maybe they could all meet up that night.\n Sandra was relieved to hear that Jessy was now surrounded by people who could be trusted. “Promise me you’ll be with someone every second of the day,” she demanded.\n “I promise,” Jessy assured her.\n Sandra hung up, and Jessy wandered back to Timothy’s room, where he was happily holding court. A little while later Dillon said he had to leave to do some work at the library. Adam excused himself, too, and said he was going to take the rental car and head over to the Sun to see if he could overhear anything useful, maybe even find someone likely to know something and get him talking. The others seemed happy enough to spend time at the home with Timothy until someone was free to pick them up.\n Once they were gone, Brent Blackhawk faced Timothy. “I’d like to hear more about the ghost dancers,” he said gravely. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nightwalker-harrison-investigation-8/page-43.html","bookId":2274,"book":{"id":2274,"title":"Nightwalker (Harrison Investigation #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Nightwalker (Harrison Investigation #8) \n Jessy Sparhawk has seen firsthand how gambling can ruin people\u0027s lives.
