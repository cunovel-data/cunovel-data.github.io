Tell me more.”\\n\\n “You’re from here and you’re working on history,” she said. “You must have heard of the Santa Geneva—and Mad Miller and his consort, Kitty Cutlass, and the murder of Dona Isabella.”\\n\\n He nodded slowly. He knew the legend. All Key West kids knew the stories about pirates in the area. They made great tales at campfires. “A piece of pirate lore,” he said.\\n\\n “Yes, and if you’re following pirate lore, you should be following that story. It was past the Golden Age of Piracy. It was after David Porter came here to clear out the pirates. There were still Spaniards living here, naturally. Dona Isabella was a wealthy woman, with homes in Madrid and Key West. She was married to Diego, a very wealthy Spanish merchant. She was kidnapped off a Spanish ship, the Santa Geneva. They say she was never ransomed because Mad Miller, the pirate, fell in love with her—and because of that, she wound up dead. Some say that Mad Miller murdered her in a frenzy, because she loathed him. Some say that Kitty Cutlass, furious over her lover’s adoration for another woman, was the one to kill her. At any rate, she supposedly wound up dead in the company of the pirates. It’s thought that she survived until the pirates reached Haunt Island, where they might have drawn in for ship repairs. Some of Mad Miller’s men then massacred the remaining crew members of the Santa Geneva, and members of their own crew who were in revolt over what had happened. Thus the name, obviously, Haunt Island, and the legend.”\\n\\n “I still don’t see—” Sean began.\\n\\n “Dona Isabella lived in Key West. Her ship, a Spanish ship, left from Key West. The pirates raided her in American waters. Off of Key West. Mad Miller came from Key West. Let’s see—Kitty Cutlass began as a prostitute in a shack on Duval. Mr. O’Hara, this is an amazing story that has everything to do with the documentary you want to film. You’re a fool if you haven’t already thought of using the legend—and the truth of what happened to the members of our film crew,” she said.\\n\\n All right—that was aggravating. But there was something desperate in her voice that kept him from entirely losing his temper.\\n\\n “Okay, Miss Loren. You have a good story. What, exactly, is it that you want? I’ve told you, we’re not any form of law enforcement. I can’t go over to the Bahamas and just solve your mystery for you.”\\n\\n She inhaled again, staring at him. She let out a long breath of air. She seemed to physically square her shoulders, as if seeking strength and resolve.\\n\\n “I know that, and…” She paused, wincing. “Look, I’m sorry. I’m just passionate about my feelings on this. First, I need you to hire me. I’m good—really good. I swear. You can check all my references,” she said.\\n\\n “I would definitely do so, no matter what,” he said.\\n\\n “I’d bet good money that she has excellent references,” Bartholomew said.\\n\\n Sean locked his jaw, determined not to turn, or respond to the ghost in any way.\\n\\n “No one is hired unless David and I agree,” he said to Vanessa.\\n\\n “That is certainly understandable,” she said. Again, she paused. “I know all about David Beckett, as well. I know that he was once accused of murder, and I know how desperate he was to find the truth. And the truth was discovered. I can’t believe that he wouldn’t understand how I feel, or be sympathetic to my cause.”\\n\\n Sean felt tension steal through his body. The Effigy Murders had been bad, very bad. He still felt they were all recovering from the terrible things that had happened. He still had scars beneath his hairline.\\n\\n David would be sympathetic, he knew.\\n\\n “Go on,” he said quietly.\\n\\n “Then—I think you need to make me your assistant. I’m excellent at managing a schedule, and I can write a scene, narrative, interview questions, anything you need, at the drop of a hat. I know you do a lot of your own scheduling and writing. That’s why I say assistant. I went to film school. When needed, I can handle any kind of a camera. I’m fit so I can tote and carry. The filmmaker in you must see what there is here—a legend that remains a mystery, historical and contemporary. You can look for the Santa Geneva, you can really follow the path of those who came before you. And if you leave out piracy, and the stamping out of the pirates, and the supposed massacre on Haunt Island, you’re doing a disservice to everyone.”\\n\\n He leaned back. “If this is such a great documentary, why don’t you do it yourself?” he demanded.\\n\\n She leaned back, biting her lower lip. “Well, for one, I don’t have the kind of money you need for a documentary. And…”\\n\\n “And?”\\n\\n She leaned forward. “Look, I’ll work cheap. I’ll work harder than anyone you ever imagined.”\\n\\n He leaned back, shaking his head. “I’d like to help you, I’d really like to help you. But it seems as if you’re chasing something, and I’m not—I’m not what you’re looking for. If these murders haven’t been solved, you need a private investigator. You need—”\\n\\n “Have you ever tried to look for a private investigator who specializes in water, legends and boats?” she asked irritably.\\n\\n He hesitated for a moment. “Look, from what I understand, every agency possible was involved in that case. If there are no clues, there are no clues.”\\n\\n “No one wanted to follow through on the legend—or the history,” she said, exasperated.\\n\\n He felt his fingers tense around his coffee cup and he stared at her. “You’re trying to tell me that pirates returned to massacre your friends?” he asked.\\n\\n Something about the tightening in her lips and the way that she stared at him caused him to feel as if he should be ashamed—as if he had spoken out of turn.\\n\\n But he hadn’t. And he couldn’t explain to her that he knew what ghosts were capable of doing, and what they weren’t. As a matter of fact, he knew a few of them….\\n\\n “That’s not what I’m suggesting at all,” she said.\\n\\n “Then?”\\n\\n “I—don’t know, exactly,” she said, looking away. “Here’s the thing. We’ve had this movie stowed since it happened. But…people know about it. I’m afraid we’ll get an offer from a major distributor. My partner would gladly sell. I don’t want to sell—not unless I can get some justice for those who were involved. I don’t want to make money on sensationalism, on something…something unsolved. I’ve gotten Jay to agree that I can try one more time to discover the truth.”\\n\\n “I—”\\n\\n “Please. Please just tell me that you’ll consider doing it?” she asked.\\n\\n He stared at her, not knowing what to say.\\n\\n No. A flat-out no would be a great answer. He and David hadn’t set anything in stone as yet, but…no. This one had to be a no. They both had their individual exemplary careers, they knew what they were doing. They could write themselves.\\n\\n “I’m sorry. I just don’t think my partner will agree,” Sean said.\\n\\n “Will you ask David Beckett?” she queried stubbornly.\\n\\n He smiled. “Will you quit asking if I talk to him and he says no?”\\n\\n She smiled. “You’re—Look, I know I’m asking a lot without much to offer. But I am really good at what I do, and if you give me a few weeks, I promise, I’ll help to make anything you want to do come out as brilliantly as possible. I’ll be slave labor, I swear.”\\n\\n “I don’t want slave labor.”\\n\\n “I’ll be the best damned assistant you’ve ever had,” she swore.\\n\\n “Take her up on it!” Bartholomew said. “Hell, my boy! Take her up on it just for the pleasure of having her upon your wretched little boat.”\\n\\n “I’ll talk to David,” he said.\\n\\n “You really will. And…and if he’s hesitant, if there’s any chance, will you let me try to persuade him, as well?” she asked.\\n\\n He forced an even smile. No, just say no!\\n\\n He asked himself if he would be so torn, so tempted, if the person asking him wasn’t this young woman, not just beautiful, but…strong. So confident in her ability that she would swear she could make his work the best ever.\\n\\n Ability.\\n\\n The way she looked.\\n\\n The sound of her voice.\\n\\n The mystery involved. Yes, he knew the damned legend. And hell yes, he was curious.\\n\\n “Look,” he began.\\n\\n But she wasn’t looking at him. She was looking at the door. She let out a little cry of surprise and gladness.\\n\\n Sean swung around. His sister had just come in the door.\\n\\n He looked at Vanessa Loren.\\n\\n Ah, hell.\\n\\n Hell.\\n\\n The young woman knew Katie. He should have figured.\\n\\n He stared back at her, irritated, and suddenly certain that it was all over.\\n\\n “You know my sister,” he said.\\n\\n She glanced at him while rising. “Yes, I know Katie. I’ve been on a few dive boats with her, and of course, I bring friends in here for Katie-okie when I’m down….”\\n\\n She started to head out to see Katie. He set his fingers around her wrist, drawing her back.\\n\\n She didn’t jerk away, but then his hold was pretty firm. Those huge, cornflower-blue eyes of hers lit on him.\\n\\n He smiled coldly. “You know my uncle, too, don’t you? And my uncle knew just who you were and what you wanted.”\\n\\n “I’ve met Jamie before, yes,” she admitted. “Katie can explain it all to David, if you don’t want to, but I know that she’ll convince him that I’m right. I came to you first, because Katie told me that David had said all the major decisions were going to be yours, so if you just agree—”\\n\\n He stood, releasing her wrist.\\n\\n “I don’t like being played,” he said flatly. “Good day, Miss Loren.”\\n\\n She didn’t call after him.\\n\\n Bartholomew did.\\n\\n “Sean! Oh, come on, Sean. I can help you with this, I was around when it all happened,” the dapper buccaneer cried to him. “Sean, oh, do come on! If I were flesh and blood, I’d be on this like a mosquito at a topless bar! Sean!” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-night-bone-island-trilogy-2/page-6.html","bookId":2287,"book":{"id":2287,"title":"Ghost Night (Bone Island Trilogy #2)","description":"Storyline: Ghost Night (Bone Island #2) \\n A slasher movie turns real when two young actors are brutally murdered on a remote island film set.
