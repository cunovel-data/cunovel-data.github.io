And they went their way. \n [bbe] And he said to them, Go into the vine-garden with the others, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went to work. \n 20:5 [hgb] 约 在 午 正 和 申 初 又 出 去 ， 也 是 这 样 行 。 \n [kjv] Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. \n [bbe] Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same. \n 20:6 [hgb] 约 在 酉 初 出 去 ， 看 见 还 有 人 站 在 那 里 。 就 问 他 们 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 整 天 在 这 里 闲 站 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? \n [bbe] And about the eleventh hour he went out and saw others doing nothing; and he says to them, Why are you here all the day doing nothing? \n 20:7 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 因 为 没 有 人 雇 我 们 。 他 说 ， 你 们 也 进 葡 萄 园 去 。 \n [kjv] They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. \n [bbe] They say to him, Because no man has given us work. He says to them, Go in with the rest, into the vine-garden. \n 20:8 [hgb] 到 了 晚 上 ， 园 主 对 管 事 的 说 ， 叫 工 人 都 来 ， 给 他 们 工 钱 ， 从 后 来 的 起 ， 到 先 来 的 为 止 。 \n [kjv] So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. \n [bbe] And when evening came, the lord of the vine-garden said to his manager, Let the workers come, and give them their payment, from the last to the first. \n 20:9 [hgb] 约 在 酉 初 雇 的 人 来 了 ， 各 人 得 了 一 钱 银 子 。 \n [kjv] And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. \n [bbe] And when those men came who had gone to work at the eleventh hour, they were given every man a penny. \n 20:10 [hgb] 及 至 那 先 雇 的 来 了 ， 他 们 以 为 必 要 多 得 。 谁 知 也 是 各 得 一 钱 。 \n [kjv] But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. \n [bbe] Then those who came first had the idea that they would get more; and they, like the rest, were given a penny. \n 20:11 [hgb] 他 们 得 了 ， 就 埋 怨 家 主 说 ， \n [kjv] And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, \n [bbe] And when they got it, they made a protest against the master of the house, \n 20:12 [hgb] 我 们 整 天 劳 苦 受 热 ， 那 后 来 的 只 做 了 一 小 时 ， 你 竟 叫 他 们 和 我 们 一 样 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. \n [bbe] Saying, These last have done only one hour\u0027s work, and you have made them equal to us, who have undergone the hard work of the day and the burning heat. \n 20:13 [hgb] 家 主 回 答 其 中 的 一 人 说 ， 朋 友 ， 我 不 亏 负 你 。 你 与 我 讲 定 的 ， 不 是 一 钱 银 子 吗 ？ \n [kjv] But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? \n [bbe] But he in answer said to one of them, Friend, I do you no wrong: did you not make an agreement with me for a penny? \n 20:14 [hgb] 拿 你 的 走 吧 。 我 给 那 后 来 的 和 给 你 一 样 ， 这 是 我 愿 意 的 。 \n [kjv] Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. \n [bbe] Take what is yours, and go away; it is my pleasure to give to this last, even as to you. \n 20:15 [hgb] 我 的 东 西 难 道 不 可 随 我 的 意 思 用 吗 ？ 因 为 我 作 好 人 ， 你 就 红 了 眼 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? \n [bbe] Have I not the right to do as seems good to me in my house? or is your eye evil, because I am good? \n 20:16 [hgb] 这 样 ， 那 在 后 的 将 要 在 前 ， 在 前 的 将 要 在 后 了 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 因 为 被 召 的 人 多 ， 选 上 的 人 少 ） \n [kjv] So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen. \n [bbe] So the last will be first, and the first last. \n 20:17 [hgb] 耶 稣 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 的 时 候 ， 在 路 上 把 十 二 个 门 徒 带 到 一 边 对 他 们 说 ， \n [kjv] And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them, \n [bbe] And when Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples on one side, and said to them, \n 20:18 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 我 们 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 人 子 要 被 交 给 祭 司 长 和 文 士 。 他 们 要 定 他 死 罪 。 \n [kjv] Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, \n [bbe] See, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be given into the hands of the chief priests and scribes; and they will give orders for him to be put to death, \n 20:19 [hgb] 又 交 给 外 邦 人 ， 将 他 戏 弄 ， 鞭 打 ， 钉 在 十 字 架 上 。 第 三 日 他 要 复 活 。 \n [kjv] And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again. \n [bbe] And will give him up to the Gentiles to be made sport of and to be whipped and to be put to death on the cross: and the third day he will come back again from the dead. \n 20:20 [hgb] 那 时 ， 西 庇 太 儿 子 的 母 亲 ， 同 她 两 个 儿 子 上 前 来 拜 耶 稣 ， 求 他 一 件 事 。 \n [kjv] Then came to him the mother of Zebedee\u0027s children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him. \n [bbe] Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, giving him worship and making a request of him. \n 20:21 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 要 什 么 呢 ？ 她 说 ， 愿 你 叫 我 这 两 个 儿 子 在 你 国 里 ， 一 个 坐 在 你 右 边 ， 一 个 坐 在 你 左 边 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom. \n [bbe] And he said to her, What is your desire? She says to him, Let my two sons be seated, the one at your right hand, and the other at your left, in your kingdom. \n 20:22 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 们 不 知 道 所 求 的 是 什 么 。 我 将 要 喝 的 杯 ， 你 们 能 喝 吗 ？ 他 们 说 ， 我 们 能 。 \n [kjv] But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able. \n [bbe] But Jesus made answer and said, You have no idea what you are requesting. Are you able to take of the cup which I am about to take? \n 20:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 我 所 喝 的 杯 ， 你 们 必 要 喝 。 只 是 坐 在 我 的 左 右 ， 不 是 我 可 以 赐 的 ， 乃 是 我 父 为 谁 预 备 的 ， 就 赐 给 谁 。 \n [kjv] And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father. \n [bbe] They say to him, We are able. He says to them, Truly, you will take of my cup: but to be seated at my right hand and at my left is not for me to give, but it is for those for whom my Father has made it ready. \n 20:24 [hgb] 那 十 个 门 徒 听 见 ， 就 恼 怒 他 们 弟 兄 二 人 。 \n [kjv] And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren. \n [bbe] And when it came to the ears of the ten, they were angry with the two brothers. \n 20:25 [hgb] 耶 稣 叫 了 他 们 来 ， 说 ， 你 们 知 道 外 邦 人 有 君 王 为 主 治 理 他 们 ， 有 大 臣 操 权 管 束 他 们 。 \n [kjv] But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them. \n [bbe] But Jesus said to them, You see that the rulers of the Gentiles are lords over them, and their great ones have authority over them. \n 20:26 [hgb] 只 是 在 你 们 中 间 不 可 这 样 。 你 们 中 间 谁 愿 为 大 ， 就 必 作 你 们 的 用 人 。 \n [kjv] But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; \n [bbe] Let it not be so among you: but if anyone has a desire to become great among you, let him be your servant; \n 20:27 [hgb] 谁 愿 为 首 ， 就 必 作 你 们 的 仆 人 。 \n [kjv] And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: \n [bbe] And whoever has a desire to be first among you, let him take the lowest place: \n 20:28 [hgb] 正 如 人 子 来 ， 不 是 要 受 人 的 服 事 ， 乃 是 要 服 事 人 。 并 且 要 舍 命 ， 作 多 人 的 赎 价 。 \n [kjv] Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. \n [bbe] Even as the Son of man did not come to have servants, but to be a servant, and to give his life for the salvation of men. \n 20:29 [hgb] 他 们 出 耶 利 哥 的 时 候 ， 有 极 多 的 人 跟 随 他 ， \n [kjv] And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. \n [bbe] And when they were going out from Jericho, a great number went after him. \n 20:30 [hgb] 有 两 个 瞎 子 坐 在 路 旁 ， 听 说 是 耶 稣 经 过 ， 就 喊 着 说 ， 主 阿 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 可 怜 我 们 吧 。 \n [kjv] And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. \n [bbe] And two blind men seated by the wayside, when they had the news that Jesus was going by, gave a loud cry, saying, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us. \n 20:31 [hgb] 众 人 责 备 他 们 ， 不 许 他 们 作 声 。 他 们 却 越 发 喊 着 说 ， 主 阿 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 可 怜 我 们 吧 。 \n [kjv] And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David. \n [bbe] And the people gave them orders to be quiet; but they went on crying even louder, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us. \n 20:32 [hgb] 耶 稣 就 站 住 ， 叫 他 们 来 ， 说 ， 要 我 为 你 们 作 什 么 。 \n [kjv] And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you? \n [bbe] And Jesus, stopping, sent for them, and said, What would you have me do to you? \n 20:33 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 主 阿 ， 要 我 们 的 眼 睛 能 看 见 。 \n [kjv] They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. \n [bbe] They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be open. \n 20:34 [hgb] 耶 稣 就 动 了 慈 心 ， 把 他 们 的 眼 睛 一 摸 ， 他 们 立 刻 看 见 ， 就 跟 从 了 耶 稣 。 \n [kjv] So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him. \n [bbe] And Jesus, being moved with pity, put his fingers on their eyes: and straight away they were able to see, and went after him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2115.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
