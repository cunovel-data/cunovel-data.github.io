Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them. \\n\\n [bbe] But I say to you that Elijah has come, and they had no knowledge of him, but did to him whatever they were pleased to do; the same will the Son of man undergo at their hands. \\n\\n 17:13 [hgb] 门 徒 这 才 明 白 耶 稣 所 说 的 ， 是 指 着 施 洗 的 约 翰 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the disciples saw that he was talking to them of John the Baptist. \\n\\n 17:14 [hgb] 耶 稣 和 门 徒 到 了 众 人 那 里 ， 有 一 个 人 来 见 耶 稣 ， 跪 下 ， 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, \\n\\n [bbe] And when they came to the people, a man went down on his knees to him, saying, \\n\\n 17:15 [hgb] 主 阿 ， 怜 悯 我 的 儿 子 。 他 害 癫 痫 的 病 很 苦 ， 屡 次 跌 在 火 里 ， 屡 次 跌 在 水 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water. \\n\\n [bbe] Lord have mercy on my son: for he is off his head, and is in great pain; and frequently he goes falling into the fire, and frequently into the water. \\n\\n 17:16 [hgb] 我 带 他 到 你 门 徒 那 里 ， 他 们 却 不 能 医 治 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him. \\n\\n [bbe] And I took him to your disciples, and they were not able to make him well. \\n\\n 17:17 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 嗳 ， 这 又 不 信 又 悖 谬 的 世 代 阿 ， 我 在 你 们 这 里 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 我 忍 耐 你 们 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 把 他 带 到 我 这 里 来 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus, answering, said, O false and foolish generation, how long will I be with you? how long will I put up with you? let him come here to me. \\n\\n 17:18 [hgb] 耶 稣 斥 责 那 鬼 ， 鬼 就 出 来 。 从 此 孩 子 就 痊 愈 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus gave orders to the unclean spirit, and it went out of him: and the boy was made well from that hour. \\n\\n 17:19 [hgb] 门 徒 暗 暗 地 到 耶 稣 跟 前 说 ， 我 们 为 什 么 不 能 赶 出 那 鬼 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? \\n\\n [bbe] Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, Why were we not able to send it out? \\n\\n 17:20 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 是 因 你 们 的 信 心 小 。 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 若 有 信 心 像 一 粒 芥 菜 种 ， 就 是 对 这 座 山 说 ， 你 从 这 边 挪 到 那 边 ， 它 也 必 挪 去 。 并 且 你 们 没 有 一 件 不 能 作 的 事 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. \\n\\n [bbe] And he says to them, Because of your little faith: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Be moved from this place to that; and it will be moved; and nothing will be impossible to you. \\n\\n 17:21 [hgb] 至 于 这 一 类 的 鬼 ， 若 不 祷 告 禁 食 ， 他 就 不 出 来 。 （ 或 作 不 能 赶 他 出 来 ） \\n\\n [kjv] Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting. \\n\\n [bbe] [] \\n\\n 17:22 [hgb] 他 们 还 住 在 加 利 利 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 对 门 徒 说 ， 人 子 将 要 被 交 在 人 手 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: \\n\\n [bbe] And while they were going about in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man will be given up into the hands of men; \\n\\n 17:23 [hgb] 他 们 要 杀 害 他 ， 第 三 日 他 要 复 活 。 门 徒 就 大 大 地 忧 愁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry. \\n\\n [bbe] And they will put him to death, and the third day he will come again from the dead. And they were very sad. \\n\\n 17:24 [hgb] 到 了 迦 百 农 ， 有 收 丁 税 的 人 来 见 彼 得 说 ， 你 们 的 先 生 不 纳 丁 税 吗 ？ （ 丁 税 约 有 半 块 钱 ） \\n\\n [kjv] And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute? \\n\\n [bbe] And when they had come to Capernaum, those who took the Temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your master make payment of the Temple tax? \\n\\n 17:25 [hgb] 彼 得 说 ， 纳 。 他 进 了 屋 子 ， 耶 稣 先 向 他 说 ， 西 门 ， 你 的 意 思 如 何 。 世 上 的 君 王 ， 向 谁 征 收 关 税 丁 税 。 是 向 自 己 的 儿 子 呢 ？ 是 向 外 人 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers? \\n\\n [bbe] He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus said to him, What is your opinion, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth get payment or tax? from their sons or from other people? \\n\\n 17:26 [hgb] 彼 得 说 ， 是 向 外 人 。 耶 稣 说 ， 既 然 如 此 ， 儿 子 就 可 以 免 税 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free. \\n\\n [bbe] And when he said, From other people, Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free. \\n\\n 17:27 [hgb] 但 恐 怕 触 犯 他 们 ， （ 触 犯 原 文 作 绊 倒 ） 你 且 往 海 边 去 钓 鱼 ， 把 先 钓 上 来 的 鱼 拿 起 来 ， 开 了 它 的 口 ， 必 得 一 块 钱 ， 可 以 拿 去 给 他 们 ， 作 你 我 的 税 银 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee. \\n\\n [bbe] But, so that we may not be a cause of trouble to them, go to the sea, and let down a hook, and take the first fish which comes up; and in his mouth you will see a bit of money: take that, and give it to them for me and you. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2112.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
