And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. \\n\\n [bbe] And he put his hand on him, saying, It is my pleasure; be clean. And straight away he was made clean. \\n\\n 8:4 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 你 切 不 可 告 诉 人 。 只 要 去 把 身 体 给 祭 司 察 看 ， 献 上 摩 西 所 吩 咐 的 礼 物 ， 对 众 人 作 证 据 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus said to him, See that you say nothing about this to anyone; but go and let the priest see you and make the offering which was ordered by Moses, for a witness to them. \\n\\n 8:5 [hgb] 耶 稣 进 了 迦 百 农 ， 有 一 个 百 夫 长 进 前 来 ， 求 他 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, \\n\\n [bbe] And when Jesus was come into Capernaum, a certain captain came to him with a request, \\n\\n 8:6 [hgb] 主 阿 ， 我 的 仆 人 害 瘫 痪 病 ， 躺 在 家 里 ， 甚 是 疼 苦 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented. \\n\\n [bbe] Saying, Lord, my servant is ill in bed at the house, with no power in his body, and in great pain. \\n\\n 8:7 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 我 去 医 治 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to him, I will come and make him well. \\n\\n 8:8 [hgb] 百 夫 长 回 答 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 到 我 舍 下 ， 我 不 敢 当 。 只 要 你 说 一 句 话 ， 我 的 仆 人 就 必 好 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. \\n\\n [bbe] And the captain in answer said, Lord, I am not good enough for you to come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be made well. \\n\\n 8:9 [hgb] 因 为 我 在 人 的 权 下 ， 也 有 兵 在 我 以 下 。 对 这 个 说 ， 去 ， 他 就 去 。 对 那 个 说 ， 来 ， 他 就 来 。 对 我 的 仆 人 说 ， 你 作 这 事 ， 他 就 去 作 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. \\n\\n [bbe] Because I myself am a man under authority, having under me fighting men; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. \\n\\n 8:10 [hgb] 耶 稣 听 见 就 希 奇 ， 对 跟 从 的 人 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 这 么 大 的 信 心 ， 就 是 在 以 色 列 中 ， 我 也 没 有 遇 见 过 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] And when these words came to the ears of Jesus he was surprised, and said to those who came after him, Truly I say to you, I have not seen such great faith, no, not in Israel. \\n\\n 8:11 [hgb] 我 又 告 诉 你 们 ， 从 东 从 西 ， 将 有 许 多 人 来 ， 在 天 国 里 与 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 以 撒 ， 雅 各 ， 一 同 坐 席 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. \\n\\n [bbe] And I say to you that numbers will come from the east and the west, and will take their seats with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven: \\n\\n 8:12 [hgb] 惟 有 本 国 的 子 民 ， 竟 被 赶 到 外 边 黑 暗 里 去 。 在 那 里 必 要 哀 哭 切 齿 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \\n\\n [bbe] But the sons of the kingdom will be put out into the dark, and there will be weeping and cries of pain. \\n\\n 8:13 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 百 夫 长 说 ， 你 回 去 吧 。 照 你 的 信 心 ， 给 你 成 全 了 。 那 时 ， 他 的 仆 人 就 好 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus said to the captain, Go in peace; as your faith is, so let it be done to you. And the servant was made well in that hour. \\n\\n 8:14 [hgb] 耶 稣 到 了 彼 得 家 里 ， 见 彼 得 的 岳 母 害 热 病 躺 着 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Jesus was come into Peter\u0027s house, he saw his wife\u0027s mother laid, and sick of a fever. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Jesus had come into Peter\u0027s house, he saw his wife\u0027s mother in bed, very ill. \\n\\n 8:15 [hgb] 耶 稣 把 她 的 手 一 摸 ， 热 就 退 了 。 她 就 起 来 服 事 耶 稣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] And he put his hand on hers and the disease went from her, and she got up and took care of his needs. \\n\\n 8:16 [hgb] 到 了 晚 上 ， 有 人 带 着 许 多 被 鬼 附 的 ， 来 到 耶 稣 跟 前 ， 他 只 用 一 句 话 ， 就 把 鬼 都 赶 出 去 。 并 且 治 好 了 一 切 有 病 的 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick: \\n\\n [bbe] And in the evening, they took to him a number of people who had evil spirits; and he sent the spirits out of them with a word, and made well all who were ill; \\n\\n 8:17 [hgb] 这 是 要 应 验 先 知 以 赛 亚 的 话 ， 说 ， 他 代 替 我 们 的 软 弱 ， 担 当 我 们 的 疾 病 。 \\n\\n [kjv] That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses. \\n\\n [bbe] So that the word of Isaiah the prophet might come true: He himself took our pains and our diseases. \\n\\n 8:18 [hgb] 耶 稣 见 许 多 人 围 着 他 ， 就 吩 咐 渡 到 那 边 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side. \\n\\n [bbe] Now when Jesus saw a great mass of people about him, he gave an order to go to the other side. \\n\\n 8:19 [hgb] 有 一 个 文 士 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 夫 子 ， 你 无 论 往 哪 里 去 ， 我 要 跟 从 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. \\n\\n [bbe] And there came a scribe and said to him, Master, I will come after you wherever you go. \\n\\n 8:20 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 狐 狸 有 洞 ， 天 空 的 飞 鸟 有 窝 ， 人 子 却 没 有 枕 头 的 地 方 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have a resting-place; but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head. \\n\\n 8:21 [hgb] 又 有 一 个 门 徒 对 耶 稣 说 ， 主 阿 ， 容 我 先 回 去 埋 葬 我 的 父 亲 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. \\n\\n [bbe] And another of the disciples said to him, Lord, let me first go and give the last honours to my father. \\n\\n 8:22 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 任 凭 死 人 埋 葬 他 们 的 死 人 ， 你 跟 从 我 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead. \\n\\n [bbe] But Jesus said to him, Come after me; and let the dead take care of their dead. \\n\\n 8:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 上 了 船 ， 门 徒 跟 着 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. \\n\\n [bbe] And when he had got into a boat, his disciples went after him. \\n\\n 8:24 [hgb] 海 里 忽 然 起 了 暴 风 ， 甚 至 船 被 波 浪 掩 盖 。 耶 稣 却 睡 着 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. \\n\\n [bbe] And there came up a great storm in the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was sleeping. \\n\\n 8:25 [hgb] 门 徒 来 叫 醒 了 他 ， 说 ， 主 阿 ， 救 我 们 ， 我 们 丧 命 啦 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish. \\n\\n [bbe] And they came to him, and, awaking him, said, Help, Lord; destruction is near. \\n\\n 8:26 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 这 小 信 的 人 哪 ， 为 什 么 胆 怯 呢 ？ 于 是 起 来 ， 斥 责 风 和 海 ， 风 和 海 就 大 大 地 平 静 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, Why are you full of fear, O you of little faith? Then he got up and gave orders to the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. \\n\\n 8:27 [hgb] 众 人 希 奇 说 ， 这 是 怎 样 的 人 ， 连 风 和 海 也 听 从 他 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him! \\n\\n [bbe] And the men were full of wonder, saying, What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea do his orders? \\n\\n 8:28 [hgb] 耶 稣 既 渡 到 那 边 去 ， 来 到 加 大 拉 人 的 地 方 ， 就 有 两 个 被 鬼 附 的 人 ， 从 坟 茔 里 出 来 迎 着 他 ， 极 其 凶 猛 ， 甚 至 没 有 人 能 从 那 条 路 上 经 过 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way. \\n\\n [bbe] And when he had come to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, there came out to him from the place of the dead, two who had evil spirits, so violent that no man was able to go that way. \\n\\n 8:29 [hgb] 他 们 喊 着 说 ， 神 的 儿 子 ， 我 们 与 你 有 什 么 相 干 。 时 候 还 没 有 到 ， 你 就 上 这 里 来 叫 我 们 受 苦 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? \\n\\n [bbe] And they gave a loud cry, saying, What have we to do with you, you Son of God? Have you come here to give us punishment before the time? \\n\\n 8:30 [hgb] 离 他 们 很 远 ， 有 一 大 群 猪 吃 食 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding. \\n\\n [bbe] Now there was, some distance away, a great herd of pigs taking their food. \\n\\n 8:31 [hgb] 鬼 就 央 求 耶 稣 说 ， 若 把 我 们 赶 出 去 ， 就 打 发 我 们 进 入 猪 群 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine. \\n\\n [bbe] And the evil spirits made strong prayers to him, saying, If you send us out, let us go into the herd of pigs. \\n\\n 8:32 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 去 吧 。 鬼 就 出 来 ， 进 入 猪 群 。 全 群 忽 然 闯 下 山 崖 ， 投 在 海 里 淹 死 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, Go. And they came out, and went into the pigs; and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea and came to their end in the water. \\n\\n 8:33 [hgb] 放 猪 的 就 逃 跑 进 城 ， 将 这 一 切 事 ， 和 被 鬼 附 的 人 所 遭 遇 的 ， 都 告 诉 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils. \\n\\n [bbe] And their keepers went in flight to the town and gave an account of everything, and of the men who had the evil spirits. \\n\\n 8:34 [hgb] 合 城 的 人 ， 都 出 来 迎 见 耶 稣 。 既 见 了 ， 就 央 求 他 离 开 他 们 的 境 界 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts. \\n\\n [bbe] And all the town came out to Jesus; and seeing him they made request that he would go away from their part of the country. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2103.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
