A reed shaken with the wind? \n [bbe] And when they were going away, Jesus, talking of John, said to all the people, What went you out into the waste land to see? a tall stem moving in the wind? \n 11:8 [hgb] 你 们 出 去 ， 到 底 是 要 看 什 么 ， 要 看 穿 细 软 衣 服 的 人 吗 ？ 那 穿 细 软 衣 服 的 人 ， 是 在 王 宫 里 。 \n [kjv] But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings\u0027 houses. \n [bbe] But what went you out to see? a man delicately clothed? Those who have fair robes are in kings\u0027 houses. \n 11:9 [hgb] 你 们 出 去 ， 究 竟 是 为 什 么 ， 是 要 看 先 知 吗 ？ 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 是 的 ， 他 比 先 知 大 多 了 。 \n [kjv] But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet. \n [bbe] But why did you go out? to see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet. \n 11:10 [hgb] 经 上 记 着 说 ， 我 要 差 遣 我 的 使 者 在 你 前 面 ， 预 备 道 路 。 所 说 的 就 是 这 个 人 。 \n [kjv] For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. \n [bbe] This is he of whom it has been said, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way before you. \n 11:11 [hgb] 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 凡 妇 人 所 生 的 ， 没 有 一 个 兴 起 来 大 过 施 洗 约 翰 的 。 然 而 天 国 里 最 小 的 ， 比 他 还 大 。 \n [kjv] Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. \n [bbe] Truly I say to you, Among the sons of women there has not been a greater than John the Baptist: but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. \n 11:12 [hgb] 从 施 洗 约 翰 的 时 候 到 如 今 ， 天 国 是 努 力 进 入 的 ， 努 力 的 人 就 得 着 了 。 \n [kjv] And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. \n [bbe] And from the days of John the Baptist till now, the kingdom of heaven is forcing its way in, and men of force take it. \n 11:13 [hgb] 因 为 众 先 知 和 律 法 说 预 言 ， 到 约 翰 为 止 。 \n [kjv] For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. \n [bbe] For all the prophets and the law were in force till John. \n 11:14 [hgb] 你 们 若 肯 领 受 ， 这 人 就 是 那 应 当 来 的 以 利 亚 。 \n [kjv] And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come. \n [bbe] And if you are able to see it, this is Elijah who was to come. \n 11:15 [hgb] 有 耳 可 听 的 ， 就 应 当 听 。 \n [kjv] He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. \n [bbe] He who has ears, let him give ear. \n 11:16 [hgb] 我 可 用 什 么 比 这 世 代 呢 ？ 好 像 孩 童 坐 在 街 市 上 ， 招 呼 同 伴 ， 说 ， \n [kjv] But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, \n [bbe] But what comparison may I make of this generation? It is like children seated in the market-places, crying out to one another, \n 11:17 [hgb] 我 们 向 你 们 吹 笛 ， 你 们 不 跳 舞 。 我 们 向 你 们 举 哀 ， 你 们 不 捶 胸 。 \n [kjv] And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. \n [bbe] We made music for you and you did not take part in the dance; we gave cries of sorrow and you made no signs of grief. \n 11:18 [hgb] 约 翰 来 了 ， 也 不 吃 ， 也 不 喝 ， 人 就 说 他 是 被 鬼 附 着 的 。 \n [kjv] For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil. \n [bbe] For John came, taking no food or drink, and they say, He has an evil spirit. \n 11:19 [hgb] 人 子 来 了 ， 也 吃 ， 也 喝 ， 人 又 说 他 是 贪 食 好 酒 的 人 ， 是 税 吏 和 罪 人 的 朋 友 。 但 智 慧 之 子 ， 总 以 智 慧 为 是 。 （ 有 古 卷 作 但 智 慧 在 行 为 上 就 显 为 是 ） \n [kjv] The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children. \n [bbe] The Son of man has come feasting, and they say, See, a lover of food and wine, a friend of tax-farmers and sinners! And wisdom is judged to be right by her works. \n 11:20 [hgb] 耶 稣 在 诸 城 中 行 了 许 多 异 能 ， 那 些 城 的 人 终 不 悔 改 ， 就 在 那 时 候 责 备 他 们 说 ， \n [kjv] Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not: \n [bbe] Then he went on to say hard things to the towns where most of his works of power were done, because they had not been turned from their sins. \n 11:21 [hgb] 哥 拉 汛 哪 ， 你 有 祸 了 ， 伯 赛 大 啊 ， 你 有 祸 了 ， 因 为 在 你 们 中 间 所 行 的 异 能 ， 若 行 在 推 罗 西 顿 ， 他 们 早 已 披 麻 蒙 灰 悔 改 了 。 \n [kjv] Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. \n [bbe] Unhappy are you, Chorazin! Unhappy are you, Beth-saida! For if the works of power which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have been turned from their sins in days gone by, clothing themselves in haircloth and putting dust on their heads. \n 11:22 [hgb] 但 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 当 审 判 的 日 子 ， 推 罗 、 西 顿 所 受 的 ， 比 你 们 还 容 易 受 呢 。 \n [kjv] But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you. \n [bbe] But I say to you, It will be better for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judging, than for you. \n 11:23 [hgb] 迦 百 农 阿 ， 你 已 经 升 到 天 上 。 （ 或 作 你 将 要 升 到 天 上 吗 ） 将 来 必 坠 落 阴 间 。 因 为 在 你 那 里 所 行 的 异 能 ， 若 行 在 所 多 玛 ， 它 还 可 以 存 到 今 日 。 \n [kjv] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. \n [bbe] And you, Capernaum, were you not to be lifted up to heaven? you will go down into hell: for if the works of power which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been here to this day. \n 11:24 [hgb] 但 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 当 审 判 的 日 子 ， 所 多 玛 所 受 的 ， 比 你 还 容 易 受 呢 。 \n [kjv] But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. \n [bbe] But I say to you that it will be better for the land of Sodom in the day of judging, than for you. \n 11:25 [hgb] 那 时 ， 耶 稣 说 ， 父 阿 ， 天 地 的 主 ， 我 感 谢 你 ， 因 为 你 将 这 些 事 ， 向 聪 明 通 达 人 ， 就 藏 起 来 ， 向 婴 孩 ， 就 显 出 来 。 \n [kjv] At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. \n [bbe] At that time Jesus made answer and said, I give praise to you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning, and have made them clear to little children. \n 11:26 [hgb] 父 阿 ， 是 的 ， 因 为 你 的 美 意 本 是 如 此 。 \n [kjv] Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight. \n [bbe] Yes, Father, for so it was pleasing in your eyes. \n 11:27 [hgb] 一 切 所 有 的 ， 都 是 我 父 交 付 我 的 。 除 了 父 ， 没 有 人 知 道 子 。 除 了 子 和 子 所 愿 意 指 示 的 ， 没 有 人 知 道 父 。 \n [kjv] All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him. \n [bbe] All things have been given to me by my Father; and no one has knowledge of the Son, but the Father; and no one has knowledge of the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will make it clear. \n 11:28 [hgb] 凡 劳 苦 担 重 担 的 人 ， 可 以 到 我 这 里 来 ， 我 就 使 你 们 得 安 息 。 \n [kjv] Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. \n [bbe] Come to me, all you who are troubled and weighted down with care, and I will give you rest. \n 11:29 [hgb] 我 心 里 柔 和 谦 卑 ， 你 们 当 负 我 的 轭 ， 学 我 的 样 式 ， 这 样 ， 你 们 心 里 就 必 得 享 安 息 。 \n [kjv] Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. \n [bbe] Take my yoke on you and become like me, for I am gentle and without pride, and you will have rest for your souls; \n 11:30 [hgb] 因 为 我 的 轭 是 容 易 的 ， 我 的 担 子 是 轻 省 的 。 \n [kjv] For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. \n [bbe] For my yoke is good, and the weight I take up is not hard. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2106.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
