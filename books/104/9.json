And he arose, and followed him. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Jesus was going from there, he saw a man whose name was Matthew, seated at the place where taxes were taken; and he said to him, Come after me. And he got up and went after him. \\n\\n 9:10 [hgb] 耶 稣 在 屋 里 坐 席 的 时 候 ， 有 好 些 税 吏 和 罪 人 来 ， 与 耶 稣 和 他 的 门 徒 一 同 坐 席 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. \\n\\n [bbe] And it came about, when he was in the house taking food, that a number of tax-farmers and sinners came and took their places with Jesus and his disciples. \\n\\n 9:11 [hgb] 法 利 赛 人 看 见 ， 就 对 耶 稣 的 门 徒 说 ， 你 们 的 先 生 为 什 么 和 税 吏 并 罪 人 一 同 吃 饭 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? \\n\\n [bbe] And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your Master take food with tax-farmers and sinners? \\n\\n 9:12 [hgb] 耶 稣 听 见 ， 就 说 ， 康 健 的 人 用 不 着 医 生 ， 有 病 的 人 才 用 得 着 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. \\n\\n [bbe] But on hearing this he said, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill. \\n\\n 9:13 [hgb] 经 上 说 ， 我 喜 爱 怜 恤 ， 不 喜 爱 祭 祀 。 这 句 话 的 意 思 ， 你 们 且 去 揣 摩 。 我 来 ， 本 不 是 召 义 人 ， 乃 是 召 罪 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. \\n\\n [bbe] But go and take to heart the sense of these words, My desire is for mercy, not offerings: for I have come not to get the upright, but sinners. \\n\\n 9:14 [hgb] 那 时 ， 约 翰 的 门 徒 来 见 耶 稣 说 ， 我 们 和 法 利 赛 人 常 常 禁 食 ， 你 的 门 徒 倒 不 禁 食 ， 这 是 为 什 么 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? \\n\\n [bbe] Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees frequently go without food, but your disciples do not? \\n\\n 9:15 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 新 郎 和 陪 伴 之 人 同 在 的 时 候 ， 陪 伴 之 人 岂 能 哀 恸 呢 ？ 但 日 子 将 到 ， 新 郎 要 离 开 他 们 ， 那 时 候 他 们 就 要 禁 食 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus said to them, Will the friends of the newly-married man be sad as long as he is with them? But the days will come when he will be taken away from them, and then will they go without food. \\n\\n 9:16 [hgb] 没 有 人 把 新 布 补 在 旧 衣 服 上 。 因 为 所 补 上 的 ， 反 带 坏 了 那 衣 服 ， 破 得 就 更 大 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. \\n\\n [bbe] And no man puts a bit of new cloth on an old coat, for by pulling away from the old, it makes a worse hole. \\n\\n 9:17 [hgb] 也 没 有 人 把 新 酒 装 在 旧 皮 袋 里 。 若 是 这 样 ， 皮 袋 就 裂 开 ， 酒 漏 出 来 ， 连 皮 袋 也 坏 了 。 惟 独 把 新 酒 装 在 新 皮 袋 里 ， 两 样 就 都 保 全 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. \\n\\n [bbe] And men do not put new wine into old wine-skins; or the skins will be burst and the wine will come out, and the skins are of no more use: but they put new wine into new wine-skins, and so the two will be safe. \\n\\n 9:18 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 这 话 的 时 候 ， 有 一 个 管 会 堂 的 来 拜 他 说 ， 我 女 儿 刚 才 死 了 ， 求 你 去 按 手 在 她 身 上 ， 她 就 必 活 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. \\n\\n [bbe] While he was saying these things to them, there came a ruler and gave him worship, saying, My daughter is even now dead; but come and put your hand on her, and she will come back to life. \\n\\n 9:19 [hgb] 耶 稣 便 起 来 ， 跟 着 他 去 ， 门 徒 也 跟 了 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus got up and went after him, and so did his disciples. \\n\\n 9:20 [hgb] 有 一 个 女 人 ， 患 了 十 二 年 的 血 漏 来 到 耶 稣 背 后 ， 摸 他 的 衣 裳 ？ ？ 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: \\n\\n [bbe] And a woman, who for twelve years had had a flow of blood, came after him, and put her hand on the edge of his robe: \\n\\n 9:21 [hgb] 因 为 她 心 里 说 ， 我 只 摸 他 的 衣 裳 ， 就 必 痊 愈 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole. \\n\\n [bbe] Because, she said to herself, if I may but put my hand on his robe, I will be made well. \\n\\n 9:22 [hgb] 耶 稣 转 过 来 看 见 她 ， 就 说 ， 女 儿 ， 放 心 ， 你 的 信 救 了 你 。 从 那 时 候 ， 女 人 就 痊 愈 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour. \\n\\n [bbe] But Jesus, turning and seeing her, said, Daughter, take heart; your faith has made you well. And the woman was made well from that hour. \\n\\n 9:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 到 了 管 会 堂 的 家 里 ， 看 见 有 吹 手 ， 又 有 许 多 人 乱 嚷 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Jesus came into the ruler\u0027s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise, \\n\\n [bbe] And when Jesus came into the ruler\u0027s house and saw the players with their instruments and the people making a noise, \\n\\n 9:24 [hgb] 就 说 ， 退 去 吧 。 这 闺 女 不 是 死 了 ， 是 睡 着 了 。 他 们 就 嗤 笑 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn. \\n\\n [bbe] He said, Make room; for the girl is not dead, but sleeping. And they were laughing at him. \\n\\n 9:25 [hgb] 众 人 既 被 撵 出 ， 耶 稣 就 进 去 ， 拉 着 闺 女 的 手 ， 闺 女 便 起 来 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose. \\n\\n [bbe] But when the people were sent out, he went in and took her by the hand; and the girl got up. \\n\\n 9:26 [hgb] 于 是 这 风 声 传 遍 了 那 地 方 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land. \\n\\n [bbe] And the news of it went out into all that land. \\n\\n 9:27 [hgb] 耶 稣 从 那 里 往 前 走 ， 有 两 个 瞎 子 跟 着 他 ， 喊 叫 说 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 可 怜 我 们 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us. \\n\\n [bbe] And when Jesus went on from there, two blind men came after him, crying out, Have mercy on us, you Son of David. \\n\\n 9:28 [hgb] 耶 稣 进 了 房 子 ， 瞎 子 就 来 到 他 跟 前 ， 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 信 我 能 作 这 事 吗 ？ 他 们 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 们 信 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord. \\n\\n [bbe] And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, Have you faith that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, Lord. \\n\\n 9:29 [hgb] 耶 稣 就 摸 他 们 的 眼 睛 ， 说 ， 照 着 你 们 的 信 给 你 们 成 全 了 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he put his hand on their eyes, saying, As your faith is, let it be done to you. \\n\\n 9:30 [hgb] 他 们 的 眼 睛 就 开 了 。 耶 稣 切 切 地 嘱 咐 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 小 心 ， 不 可 叫 人 知 道 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it. \\n\\n [bbe] And their eyes were made open. And Jesus said to them sharply, Let no man have knowledge of it. \\n\\n 9:31 [hgb] 他 们 出 去 ， 竟 把 他 的 名 声 传 遍 了 那 地 方 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country. \\n\\n [bbe] But they went out and gave news of him in all that land. \\n\\n 9:32 [hgb] 他 们 出 去 的 时 候 ， 有 人 将 鬼 所 附 的 一 个 哑 吧 ， 带 到 耶 稣 跟 前 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil. \\n\\n [bbe] And while they were going away, there came to him a man without the power of talking, and with an evil spirit. \\n\\n 9:33 [hgb] 鬼 被 赶 出 去 ， 哑 吧 就 说 出 话 来 。 众 人 都 希 奇 说 ， 在 以 色 列 中 ， 从 来 没 有 见 过 这 样 的 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the evil spirit had been sent out, the man had the power of talking: and they were all surprised, saying, Such a thing has never been seen in Israel. \\n\\n 9:34 [hgb] 法 利 赛 人 却 说 ， 他 是 靠 着 鬼 王 赶 鬼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils. \\n\\n [bbe] But the Pharisees said, By the ruler of evil spirits, he sends evil spirits out of men. \\n\\n 9:35 [hgb] 耶 稣 走 遍 各 城 各 乡 ， 在 会 堂 里 教 训 人 ， 宣 讲 天 国 的 福 音 ， 又 医 治 各 样 的 病 症 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus went about all the towns and small places, teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom and making well all sorts of disease and pain. \\n\\n 9:36 [hgb] 他 看 见 许 多 的 人 ， 就 怜 悯 他 们 。 因 为 他 们 困 苦 流 离 ， 如 同 羊 没 有 牧 人 一 般 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. \\n\\n [bbe] But when he saw all the people he was moved with pity for them, because they were troubled and wandering like sheep without a keeper. \\n\\n 9:37 [hgb] 于 是 对 门 徒 说 ， 要 收 的 庄 稼 多 ， 作 工 的 人 少 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; \\n\\n [bbe] Then he said to his disciples, There is much grain but not enough men to get it in. \\n\\n 9:38 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 当 求 庄 稼 的 主 ， 打 发 工 人 出 去 ， 收 他 的 庄 稼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest. \\n\\n [bbe] Make prayer, then, to the Lord of the grain-fields, that he may send out workers to get in his grain. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2104.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
