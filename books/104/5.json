A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. \n [bbe] You are the light of the world. A town put on a hill may be seen by all. \n 5:15 [hgb] 人 点 灯 ， 不 放 在 斗 底 下 ， 是 放 在 灯 台 上 ， 就 照 亮 一 家 的 人 。 \n [kjv] Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. \n [bbe] And a burning light is not put under a vessel, but on its table; so that its rays may be shining on all who are in the house. \n 5:16 [hgb] 你 们 的 光 也 当 这 样 照 在 人 前 ， 叫 他 们 看 见 你 们 的 好 行 为 ， 便 将 荣 耀 归 给 你 们 在 天 上 的 父 。 \n [kjv] Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. \n [bbe] Even so let your light be shining before men, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven. \n 5:17 [hgb] 莫 想 我 来 要 废 掉 律 法 和 先 知 。 我 来 不 是 要 废 掉 ， 乃 是 要 成 全 。 \n [kjv] Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. \n [bbe] Let there be no thought that I have come to put an end to the law or the prophets. I have not come for destruction, but to make complete. \n 5:18 [hgb] 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 就 是 到 天 地 都 废 去 了 ， 律 法 的 一 点 一 画 也 不 能 废 去 ， 都 要 成 全 。 \n [kjv] For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. \n [bbe] Truly I say to you, Till heaven and earth come to an end, not the smallest letter or part of a letter will in any way be taken from the law, till all things are done. \n 5:19 [hgb] 所 以 无 论 何 人 废 掉 这 诫 命 中 最 小 的 一 条 ， 又 教 训 人 这 样 作 ， 他 在 天 国 要 称 为 最 小 的 。 但 无 论 何 人 遵 行 这 诫 命 ， 又 教 训 人 遵 行 ， 他 在 天 国 要 称 为 大 的 。 \n [kjv] Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. \n [bbe] Whoever then goes against the smallest of these laws, teaching men to do the same, will be named least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who keeps the laws, teaching others to keep them, will be named great in the kingdom of heaven. \n 5:20 [hgb] 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 的 义 ， 若 不 胜 于 文 士 和 法 利 赛 人 的 义 ， 断 不 能 进 天 国 。 \n [kjv] For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. \n [bbe] For I say to you, If your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never go into the kingdom of heaven. \n 5:21 [hgb] 你 们 听 见 有 吩 咐 古 人 的 话 ， 说 ， 不 可 杀 人 ， 又 说 ， 凡 杀 人 的 ， 难 免 受 审 判 。 \n [kjv] Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: \n [bbe] You have knowledge that it was said in old times, You may not put to death; and, Whoever puts to death will be in danger of being judged: \n 5:22 [hgb] 只 是 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 凡 向 弟 兄 动 怒 的 ， 难 免 受 审 判 。 （ 有 古 卷 在 凡 字 下 添 无 缘 无 故 地 五 字 ） 凡 骂 弟 兄 是 拉 加 的 ， 难 免 公 会 的 审 断 。 凡 骂 弟 兄 是 魔 利 的 ， 难 免 地 狱 的 火 。 \n [kjv] But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. \n [bbe] But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of being judged; and he who says to his brother, Raca, will be in danger from the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, You foolish one, will be in danger of the hell of fire. \n 5:23 [hgb] 所 以 你 在 祭 坛 上 献 礼 物 的 时 候 ， 若 想 起 弟 兄 向 你 怀 怨 ， \n [kjv] Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; \n [bbe] If then you are making an offering at the altar and there it comes to your mind that your brother has something against you, \n 5:24 [hgb] 就 把 礼 物 留 在 坛 前 ， 先 去 同 弟 兄 和 好 ， 然 后 来 献 礼 物 。 \n [kjv] Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. \n [bbe] While your offering is still before the altar, first go and make peace with your brother, then come and make your offering. \n 5:25 [hgb] 你 同 告 你 的 对 头 还 在 路 上 ， 就 赶 紧 与 他 和 息 。 恐 怕 他 把 你 送 给 审 判 官 ， 审 判 官 交 付 衙 役 ， 你 就 下 在 监 里 了 。 \n [kjv] Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. \n [bbe] Come to an agreement quickly with him who has a cause against you at law, while you are with him on the way, for fear that he may give you up to the judge and the judge may give you to the police and you may be put into prison. \n 5:26 [hgb] 我 实 在 告 诉 你 ， 若 有 一 文 钱 没 有 还 清 ， 你 断 不 能 从 那 里 出 来 。 \n [kjv] Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. \n [bbe] Truly I say to you, You will not come out from there till you have made payment of the very last farthing. \n 5:27 [hgb] 你 们 听 见 有 话 说 ， 不 可 奸 淫 。 \n [kjv] Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: \n [bbe] You have knowledge that it was said, You may not have connection with another man\u0027s wife: \n 5:28 [hgb] 只 是 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 凡 看 见 妇 女 就 动 淫 念 的 ， 这 人 心 里 已 经 与 她 犯 奸 淫 了 。 \n [kjv] But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. \n [bbe] But I say to you that everyone whose eyes are turned on a woman with desire has had connection with her in his heart. \n 5:29 [hgb] 若 是 你 的 右 眼 叫 你 跌 倒 ， 就 剜 出 来 丢 掉 。 宁 可 失 去 百 体 中 的 一 体 ， 不 叫 全 身 丢 在 地 狱 里 。 \n [kjv] And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. \n [bbe] And if your right eye is a cause of trouble to you, take it out and put it away from you; because it is better to undergo the loss of one part, than for all your body to go into hell. \n 5:30 [hgb] 若 是 右 手 叫 你 跌 倒 ， 就 砍 下 来 丢 掉 。 宁 可 失 去 百 体 中 的 一 体 ， 不 叫 全 身 下 入 地 狱 。 \n [kjv] And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. \n [bbe] And if your right hand is a cause of trouble to you, let it be cut off and put it away from you; because it is better to undergo the loss of one part, than for all your body to go into hell. \n 5:31 [hgb] 又 有 话 说 ， 人 若 休 妻 ， 就 当 给 她 休 书 。 \n [kjv] It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: \n [bbe] Again, it was said, Whoever puts away his wife has to give her a statement in writing for this purpose: \n 5:32 [hgb] 只 是 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 凡 休 妻 的 ， 若 不 是 为 淫 乱 的 缘 故 ， 就 是 叫 她 作 淫 妇 了 。 人 若 娶 这 被 休 的 妇 人 ， 也 是 犯 奸 淫 了 。 \n [kjv] But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. \n [bbe] But I say to you that everyone who puts away his wife for any other cause but the loss of her virtue, makes her false to her husband; and whoever takes her as his wife after she is put away, is no true husband to her. \n 5:33 [hgb] 你 们 又 听 见 有 吩 咐 古 人 的 话 ， 说 ， 不 可 背 誓 ， 所 起 的 誓 ， 总 要 向 主 谨 守 。 \n [kjv] Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: \n [bbe] Again, you have knowledge that it was said in old times, Do not take false oaths, but give effect to your oaths to the Lord: \n 5:34 [hgb] 只 是 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 什 么 誓 都 不 可 起 ， 不 可 指 着 天 起 誓 ， 因 为 天 是 神 的 座 位 。 \n [kjv] But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God\u0027s throne: \n [bbe] But I say to you, Take no oaths at all: not by the heaven, because it is the seat of God; \n 5:35 [hgb] 不 可 指 着 地 起 誓 ， 因 为 地 是 他 的 脚 凳 。 也 不 可 指 着 耶 路 撒 冷 起 誓 ， 因 为 耶 路 撒 冷 是 大 君 的 京 城 。 \n [kjv] Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. \n [bbe] Or by the earth, because it is the resting-place for his foot; or by Jerusalem, because it is the town of the great King. \n 5:36 [hgb] 又 不 可 指 着 你 的 头 起 誓 ， 因 为 你 不 能 使 一 根 头 发 变 黑 变 白 了 。 \n [kjv] Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. \n [bbe] You may not take an oath by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black. \n 5:37 [hgb] 你 们 的 话 ， 是 ， 就 说 是 ， 不 是 ， 就 说 不 是 。 若 再 多 说 ， 就 是 出 于 那 恶 者 。 （ 或 作 是 从 恶 里 出 来 的 ） \n [kjv] But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. \n [bbe] But let your words be simply, Yes or No: and whatever is more than these is of the Evil One. \n 5:38 [hgb] 你 们 听 见 有 话 说 ， 以 眼 还 眼 ， 以 牙 还 牙 。 \n [kjv] Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: \n [bbe] You have knowledge that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: \n 5:39 [hgb] 只 是 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 不 要 与 恶 人 作 对 。 有 人 打 你 的 右 脸 ， 连 左 脸 也 转 过 来 由 他 打 。 \n [kjv] But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. \n [bbe] But I say to you, Do not make use of force against an evil man; but to him who gives you a blow on the right side of your face let the left be turned. \n 5:40 [hgb] 有 人 想 要 告 你 ， 要 拿 你 的 里 衣 ， 连 外 衣 也 由 他 拿 去 。 \n [kjv] And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. \n [bbe] And if any man goes to law with you and takes away your coat, do not keep back your robe from him. \n 5:41 [hgb] 有 人 强 逼 你 走 一 里 路 ， 你 就 同 他 走 二 里 。 \n [kjv] And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. \n [bbe] And whoever makes you go one mile, go with him two. \n 5:42 [hgb] 有 求 你 的 ， 就 给 他 。 有 向 你 借 贷 的 ， 不 可 推 辞 。 \n [kjv] Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. \n [bbe] Give to him who comes with a request, and keep not your property from him who would for a time make use of it. \n 5:43 [hgb] 你 们 听 见 有 话 说 ， 当 爱 你 的 邻 舍 ， 恨 你 的 仇 敌 。 \n [kjv] Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. \n [bbe] You have knowledge that it was said, Have love for your neighbour, and hate for him who is against you: \n 5:44 [hgb] 只 是 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 要 爱 你 们 的 仇 敌 。 为 那 逼 迫 你 们 的 祷 告 。 \n [kjv] But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; \n [bbe] But I say to you, Have love for those who are against you, and make prayer for those who are cruel to you; \n 5:45 [hgb] 这 样 ， 就 可 以 作 你 们 天 父 的 儿 子 。 因 为 他 叫 日 头 照 好 人 ， 也 照 歹 人 ， 降 雨 给 义 人 ， 也 给 不 义 的 人 。 \n [kjv] That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. \n [bbe] So that you may be the sons of your Father in heaven; for his sun gives light to the evil and to the good, and he sends rain on the upright man and on the sinner. \n 5:46 [hgb] 你 们 若 单 爱 那 爱 你 们 的 人 。 有 什 么 赏 赐 呢 ？ 就 是 税 吏 不 也 是 这 样 行 吗 ？ \n [kjv] For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? \n [bbe] For if you have love for those who have love for you, what credit is it to you? do not the tax-farmers the same? \n 5:47 [hgb] 你 们 若 单 请 你 弟 兄 的 安 ， 比 人 有 什 么 长 处 呢 ？ 就 是 外 邦 人 不 也 是 这 样 行 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? \n [bbe] And if you say, Good day, to your brothers only, what do you do more than others? do not even the Gentiles the same? \n 5:48 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 要 完 全 ， 象 你 们 的 天 父 完 全 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. \n [bbe] Be then complete in righteousness, even as your Father in heaven is complete. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2100.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
