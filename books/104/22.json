And he was speechless. \n [bbe] And he says to him, Friend, how came you in here not having a guest\u0027s robe? And he had nothing to say. \n 22:13 [hgb] 于 是 王 对 使 唤 的 人 说 ， 捆 起 他 的 手 脚 来 ， 把 他 丢 在 外 边 的 黑 暗 里 。 在 那 里 必 要 哀 哭 切 齿 了 。 \n [kjv] Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \n [bbe] Then the king said to the servants, Put cords round his hands and feet and put him out into the dark; there will be weeping and cries of sorrow. \n 22:14 [hgb] 因 为 被 召 的 人 多 ， 选 上 的 人 少 。 \n [kjv] For many are called, but few are chosen. \n [bbe] For out of all to whom the good news has come, only a small number will get salvation. \n 22:15 [hgb] 当 时 ， 法 利 赛 人 出 去 商 议 ， 怎 样 就 着 耶 稣 的 话 陷 害 他 。 \n [kjv] Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. \n [bbe] Then the Pharisees went and had a meeting to see how they might make use of his words to take him. \n 22:16 [hgb] 就 打 发 他 们 的 门 徒 ， 同 希 律 党 的 人 ， 去 见 耶 稣 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 们 知 道 你 是 诚 实 人 ， 并 且 诚 诚 实 实 传 神 的 道 ， 什 么 人 你 都 不 徇 情 面 ， 因 为 你 不 看 人 的 外 貌 。 \n [kjv] And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. \n [bbe] And they sent to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, we see that you are true, and that you are teaching the true way of God, and have no fear of anyone, because you have no respect for a man\u0027s position. \n 22:17 [hgb] 请 告 诉 我 们 ， 你 的 意 见 如 何 。 纳 税 给 该 撒 ， 可 以 不 可 以 。 \n [kjv] Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? \n [bbe] Give us, then, your opinion of this: Is it right to give tax to Caesar, or not? \n 22:18 [hgb] 耶 稣 看 出 他 们 的 恶 意 ， 就 说 ， 假 冒 为 善 的 人 哪 ， 为 什 么 试 探 我 。 \n [kjv] But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? \n [bbe] But Jesus saw their trick and said, Oh false ones, why are you attempting to put me in the wrong? \n 22:19 [hgb] 拿 一 个 上 税 的 钱 给 我 看 。 他 们 就 拿 一 个 银 钱 来 给 他 。 \n [kjv] Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. \n [bbe] Let me see the tax money. And they gave him a penny. \n 22:20 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 这 像 和 这 号 是 谁 的 。 \n [kjv] And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? \n [bbe] And he said to them, Whose is this image and name on it? \n 22:21 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 是 该 撒 的 。 耶 稣 说 ， 这 样 ， 该 撒 的 物 当 归 给 该 撒 ， 神 的 物 当 归 给 神 。 \n [kjv] They say unto him, Caesar\u0027s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u0027s; and unto God the things that are God\u0027s. \n [bbe] They say to him, Caesar\u0027s. Then he said to them, Give to Caesar the things which are Caesar\u0027s, and to God the things which are God\u0027s. \n 22:22 [hgb] 他 们 听 见 就 希 奇 ， 离 开 他 走 了 。 \n [kjv] When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way. \n [bbe] And hearing it, they were full of wonder, and went away from him. \n 22:23 [hgb] 撒 都 该 人 常 说 没 有 复 活 的 事 。 那 天 ， 他 们 来 问 耶 稣 说 ， \n [kjv] The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him, \n [bbe] On the same day there came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no coming back from the dead: and they put a question to him, saying, \n 22:24 [hgb] 夫 子 ， 摩 西 说 ， 人 若 死 了 ， 没 有 孩 子 ， 他 兄 弟 当 娶 他 的 妻 ， 为 哥 哥 生 子 立 后 。 \n [kjv] Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. \n [bbe] Master, Moses said, If a man, at the time of his death, has no children, let his brother take his wife, and get a family for his brother; \n 22:25 [hgb] 从 前 在 我 们 这 里 ， 有 弟 兄 七 人 。 第 一 个 娶 了 妻 ， 死 了 ， 没 有 孩 子 ， 撇 下 妻 子 给 兄 弟 。 \n [kjv] Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother: \n [bbe] Now there were among us seven brothers; and the first was married and at his death, having no seed, gave his wife to his brother; \n 22:26 [hgb] 第 二 第 三 直 到 第 七 个 ， 都 是 如 此 。 \n [kjv] Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. \n [bbe] In the same way the second and the third, up to the seventh. \n 22:27 [hgb] 末 后 ， 妇 人 也 死 了 。 \n [kjv] And last of all the woman died also. \n [bbe] And last of all the woman came to her end. \n 22:28 [hgb] 这 样 当 复 活 的 时 候 ， 她 是 七 个 人 中 ， 那 一 个 的 妻 子 呢 ？ 因 为 他 们 都 娶 过 她 。 \n [kjv] Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her. \n [bbe] When they come back from the dead, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? because they all had her. \n 22:29 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 们 错 了 。 因 为 不 明 白 圣 经 ， 也 不 晓 得 神 的 大 能 。 \n [kjv] Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. \n [bbe] But Jesus said to them in answer, You are in error, not having knowledge of the Writings, or of the power of God. \n 22:30 [hgb] 当 复 活 的 时 候 ， 人 也 不 娶 也 不 嫁 ， 乃 像 天 上 的 使 者 一 样 。 \n [kjv] For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. \n [bbe] For when they come back from the dead there are no husbands and wives, but they are as the angels in heaven. \n 22:31 [hgb] 论 到 死 人 复 活 ， 神 在 经 上 向 你 们 所 说 的 ， 你 们 没 有 念 过 吗 ？ \n [kjv] But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, \n [bbe] But about the dead coming back to life, have you no knowledge of what was said to you by God in the Writings: \n 22:32 [hgb] 他 说 ， 我 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 神 ， 以 撒 的 神 ， 雅 各 的 神 。 神 不 是 死 人 的 神 ， 乃 是 活 人 的 神 。 \n [kjv] I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. \n [bbe] I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead but of the living. \n 22:33 [hgb] 众 人 听 见 这 话 ， 就 希 奇 他 的 教 训 。 \n [kjv] And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. \n [bbe] And the people hearing it were surprised at his teaching. \n 22:34 [hgb] 法 利 赛 人 听 见 耶 稣 堵 住 了 撒 都 该 人 的 口 ， 他 们 就 聚 集 。 \n [kjv] But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together. \n [bbe] But the Pharisees, hearing how the mouths of the Sadducees had been stopped, came together; \n 22:35 [hgb] 内 中 有 一 个 人 是 律 法 师 ， 要 试 探 耶 稣 ， 就 问 他 说 ， \n [kjv] Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, \n [bbe] And one of them, a teacher of the law, put a question to him, testing him, and saying, \n 22:36 [hgb] 夫 子 ， 律 法 上 的 诫 命 ， 那 一 条 是 最 大 的 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Master, which is the great commandment in the law? \n [bbe] Master, which is the chief rule in the law? \n 22:37 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 你 要 尽 心 ， 尽 性 ， 尽 意 ， 爱 主 你 的 神 。 \n [kjv] Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. \n [bbe] And he said to him, Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. \n 22:38 [hgb] 这 是 诫 命 中 的 第 一 ， 且 是 最 大 的 。 \n [kjv] This is the first and great commandment. \n [bbe] This is the first and greatest rule. \n 22:39 [hgb] 其 次 也 相 仿 ， 就 是 要 爱 人 如 己 。 \n [kjv] And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. \n [bbe] And a second like it is this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself. \n 22:40 [hgb] 这 两 条 诫 命 ， 是 律 法 和 先 知 一 切 道 理 的 总 纲 。 \n [kjv] On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. \n [bbe] On these two rules all the law and the prophets are based. \n 22:41 [hgb] 法 利 赛 人 聚 集 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 问 他 们 说 ， \n [kjv] While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, \n [bbe] Now while the Pharisees were together, Jesus put a question to them, saying, \n 22:42 [hgb] 论 到 基 督 ， 你 们 的 意 见 如 何 ？ 他 是 谁 的 子 孙 呢 ？ 他 们 回 答 说 ， 是 大 卫 的 子 孙 。 \n [kjv] Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David. \n [bbe] What is your opinion of the Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, The Son of David. \n 22:43 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 这 样 ， 大 卫 被 圣 灵 感 动 ， 怎 么 还 称 他 为 主 。 说 ， \n [kjv] He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, \n [bbe] He says to them, How then does David in the Spirit give him the name of Lord, saying, \n 22:44 [hgb] 主 对 我 主 说 ， 你 坐 在 我 的 右 边 ， 等 我 把 你 仇 敌 ， 放 在 你 的 脚 下 。 \n [kjv] The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? \n [bbe] The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand, till I put under your feet all those who are against you? \n 22:45 [hgb] 大 卫 既 称 他 为 主 ， 他 怎 么 又 是 大 卫 的 子 孙 呢 ？ \n [kjv] If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? \n [bbe] If David then gives him the name of Lord, how is he his son? \n 22:46 [hgb] 他 们 没 有 一 个 人 能 回 答 一 言 。 从 那 日 以 后 ， 也 没 有 人 敢 再 问 他 什 么 。 \n [kjv] And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions. \n [bbe] And no one was able to give him an answer, and so great was their fear of him, that from that day no one put any more questions to him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2117.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
