\\n\\n [bbe] And when he came into Jerusalem, all the town was moved, saying, Who is this? \\n\\n 21:11 [hgb] 众 人 说 ， 这 是 加 利 利 拿 撒 勒 的 先 知 耶 稣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee. \\n\\n [bbe] And the people said, This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee. \\n\\n 21:12 [hgb] 耶 稣 进 了 神 的 殿 ， 赶 出 殿 里 一 切 作 买 卖 的 人 ， 推 倒 兑 换 银 钱 之 人 的 桌 子 ， 和 卖 鸽 子 之 人 的 凳 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus went into the Temple and sent out all who were trading there, overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those trading in doves. \\n\\n 21:13 [hgb] 对 他 们 说 ， 经 上 记 着 说 ， 我 的 殿 必 称 为 祷 告 的 殿 。 你 们 倒 使 它 成 为 贼 窝 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, It is in the Writings, My house is to be named a house of prayer, but you are making it a hole of thieves. \\n\\n 21:14 [hgb] 在 殿 里 有 瞎 子 瘸 子 ， 到 耶 稣 跟 前 。 他 就 治 好 了 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them. \\n\\n [bbe] And the blind and the broken in body came to him in the Temple, and he made them well. \\n\\n 21:15 [hgb] 祭 司 长 和 文 士 ， 看 见 耶 稣 所 行 的 奇 事 ， 又 见 小 孩 子 在 殿 里 喊 着 说 ， 和 散 那 归 于 大 卫 的 子 孙 。 就 甚 恼 怒 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased, \\n\\n [bbe] But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the works of power which he did, and the children crying out in the Temple, Glory to the son of David, they were angry and said to him, \\n\\n 21:16 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 这 些 人 所 说 的 ， 你 听 见 了 吗 ？ 耶 稣 说 ， 是 的 ， 经 上 说 ， 你 从 婴 孩 和 吃 奶 的 口 中 ， 完 全 了 赞 美 的 话 。 你 们 没 有 念 过 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? \\n\\n [bbe] Have you any idea what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes: have you not seen in the Writings, From the lips of children and babies at the breast you have made your praise complete? \\n\\n 21:17 [hgb] 于 是 离 开 他 们 出 城 到 伯 大 尼 去 ， 在 那 里 住 宿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there. \\n\\n [bbe] And he went away from them, and went out of the town to Bethany, and was there for the night. \\n\\n 21:18 [hgb] 早 晨 回 城 的 时 候 ， 他 饿 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered. \\n\\n [bbe] Now in the morning when he was coming back to the town, he had a desire for food. \\n\\n 21:19 [hgb] 看 见 路 旁 有 一 棵 无 花 果 树 ， 就 走 到 跟 前 ， 在 树 上 找 不 着 什 么 ， 不 过 有 叶 子 。 就 对 树 说 ， 从 今 以 后 ， 你 永 不 结 果 子 。 那 无 花 果 树 就 立 刻 枯 干 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away. \\n\\n [bbe] And seeing a fig-tree by the wayside, he came to it, and saw nothing on it but leaves only; and he said to it, Let there be no fruit from you from this time forward for ever. And straight away the fig-tree became dry and dead. \\n\\n 21:20 [hgb] 门 徒 看 见 了 ， 便 希 奇 说 ， 无 花 果 树 怎 么 立 刻 枯 干 了 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away! \\n\\n [bbe] And when the disciples saw it they were surprised, saying, How did the fig-tree become dry in so short a time? \\n\\n 21:21 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 若 有 信 心 ， 不 疑 惑 ， 不 但 能 行 无 花 果 树 上 所 行 的 事 ， 就 是 对 这 座 山 说 ， 你 挪 开 此 地 ， 投 在 海 里 ， 也 必 成 就 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus in answer said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, without doubting, not only may you do what has been done to the fig-tree, but even if you say to this mountain, Be taken up and put into the sea, it will be done. \\n\\n 21:22 [hgb] 你 们 祷 告 ， 无 论 求 什 么 ， 只 要 信 ， 就 必 得 着 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive. \\n\\n [bbe] And all things, whatever you make request for in prayer, having faith, you will get. \\n\\n 21:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 进 了 殿 ， 正 教 训 人 的 时 候 ， 祭 司 长 和 民 间 的 长 老 来 问 他 说 ， 你 仗 着 什 么 权 柄 作 这 些 事 ？ 给 你 这 权 柄 的 是 谁 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? \\n\\n [bbe] And when he had come into the Temple, the chief priests and those in authority over the people came to him while he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you do these things? and who gave you this authority? \\n\\n 21:24 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 我 也 要 问 你 们 一 句 话 ， 你 们 若 告 诉 我 ， 我 就 告 诉 你 们 我 仗 着 什 么 权 柄 作 这 些 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus said to them in answer, I will put one question to you, and if you give me the answer, I will say by what authority I do these things. \\n\\n 21:25 [hgb] 约 翰 的 洗 礼 是 从 哪 里 来 的 ？ 是 从 天 上 来 的 ？ 是 从 人 间 来 的 呢 ？ 他 们 彼 此 商 议 说 ， 我 们 若 说 从 天 上 来 ， 他 必 对 我 们 说 ， 这 样 ， 你 们 为 什 么 不 信 他 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? \\n\\n [bbe] The baptism of John, where did it come from? from heaven or from men? And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did you not have faith in him? \\n\\n 21:26 [hgb] 若 说 从 人 间 来 ， 我 们 又 怕 百 姓 。 因 为 他 们 都 以 约 翰 为 先 知 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet. \\n\\n [bbe] But if we say, From men; we are in fear of the people, because all take John to be a prophet. \\n\\n 21:27 [hgb] 于 是 回 答 耶 稣 说 ， 我 们 不 知 道 。 耶 稣 说 ， 我 也 不 告 诉 你 们 我 仗 着 什 么 权 柄 作 这 些 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. \\n\\n [bbe] And they made answer and said, We have no idea. Then he said to them, And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things. \\n\\n 21:28 [hgb] 又 说 ， 一 个 人 有 两 个 儿 子 ， 他 来 对 大 儿 子 说 ， 我 儿 ， 你 今 天 到 葡 萄 园 里 去 作 工 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard. \\n\\n [bbe] But how does it seem to you? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go and do work today in the vine-garden. \\n\\n 21:29 [hgb] 他 回 答 说 ， 我 不 去 。 以 后 自 己 懊 悔 就 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said in answer, I will not: but later, changing his decision, he went. \\n\\n 21:30 [hgb] 又 来 对 小 儿 子 也 是 这 样 说 ， 他 回 答 说 ， 父 阿 ， 我 去 。 他 却 不 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not. \\n\\n [bbe] And he came to the second and said the same. And he made answer and said, I go, sir: and went not. \\n\\n 21:31 [hgb] 你 们 想 这 两 个 儿 子 ， 是 那 一 个 遵 行 父 命 呢 ？ 他 们 说 ， 大 儿 子 。 耶 稣 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 税 吏 和 娼 妓 ， 倒 比 你 们 先 进 神 的 国 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. \\n\\n [bbe] Which of the two did his father\u0027s pleasure? They say, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, that tax-farmers and loose women are going into the kingdom of God before you. \\n\\n 21:32 [hgb] 因 为 约 翰 遵 着 义 路 到 你 们 这 里 来 ， 你 们 却 不 信 他 。 税 吏 和 娼 妓 倒 信 他 。 你 们 看 见 了 ， 后 来 还 是 不 懊 悔 去 信 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him. \\n\\n [bbe] For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you had no faith in him, but the tax-farmers and the loose women had faith in him: and you, when you saw it, did not even have regret for your sins, so as to have faith in him. \\n\\n 21:33 [hgb] 你 们 再 听 一 个 比 喻 。 有 个 家 主 ， 栽 了 一 个 葡 萄 园 ， 周 围 圈 上 篱 笆 ， 里 面 挖 了 一 个 压 酒 池 ， 盖 了 一 座 楼 ， 租 给 园 户 ， 就 往 外 国 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country: \\n\\n [bbe] Give ear to another story. A master of a house made a vine garden, and put a wall round it, and made a place for crushing out the wine, and made a tower, and let it out to field-workers, and went into another country. \\n\\n 21:34 [hgb] 收 果 子 的 时 候 近 了 ， 就 打 发 仆 人 ， 到 园 户 那 里 去 收 果 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the time for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the workmen, to get the fruit. \\n\\n 21:35 [hgb] 园 户 拿 住 仆 人 。 打 了 一 个 ， 杀 了 一 个 ， 用 石 头 打 死 一 个 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. \\n\\n [bbe] And the workmen made an attack on his servants, giving blows to one, putting another to death, and stoning another. \\n\\n 21:36 [hgb] 主 人 又 打 发 别 的 仆 人 去 ， 比 先 前 更 多 。 园 户 还 是 照 样 待 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise. \\n\\n [bbe] Again, he sent other servants more in number than the first: and they did the same to them. \\n\\n 21:37 [hgb] 后 来 打 发 他 的 儿 子 到 他 们 那 里 去 ， 意 思 说 ， 他 们 必 尊 敬 我 的 儿 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son. \\n\\n [bbe] But after that he sent his son to them, saying, They will have respect for my son. \\n\\n 21:38 [hgb] 不 料 ， 园 户 看 见 他 儿 子 ， 就 彼 此 说 ， 这 是 承 受 产 业 的 。 来 吧 ， 我 们 杀 他 ， 占 他 的 产 业 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. \\n\\n [bbe] But when the workmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property; come, let us put him to death and take his heritage. \\n\\n 21:39 [hgb] 他 们 就 拿 住 他 ， 推 出 葡 萄 园 外 杀 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. \\n\\n [bbe] And they took him and, driving him out of the vine-garden, put him to death. \\n\\n 21:40 [hgb] 园 主 来 的 时 候 ， 要 怎 样 处 治 这 些 园 户 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen? \\n\\n [bbe] When, then, the lord of the vine-garden comes, what will he do to those workmen? \\n\\n 21:41 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 要 下 毒 手 除 灭 那 些 恶 人 ， 将 葡 萄 园 另 租 给 那 按 着 时 候 交 果 子 的 园 户 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons. \\n\\n [bbe] They say to him, He will put those cruel men to a cruel death, and will let out the vine-garden to other workmen, who will give him the fruit when it is ready. \\n\\n 21:42 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 经 上 写 着 ， 匠 人 所 弃 的 石 头 ， 已 作 了 房 角 的 头 块 石 头 。 这 是 主 所 作 的 ， 在 我 们 眼 中 看 为 希 奇 。 这 经 你 们 没 有 念 过 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord\u0027s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? \\n\\n [bbe] Jesus says to them, Did you never see in the Writings, The stone which the builders put on one side, the same has been made the chief stone of the building: this was the Lord\u0027s doing, and it is a wonder in our eyes? \\n\\n 21:43 [hgb] 所 以 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 神 的 国 ， 必 从 你 们 夺 去 。 赐 给 那 能 结 果 子 的 百 姓 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. \\n\\n [bbe] For this reason I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken away from you, and will be given to a nation producing the fruits of it. \\n\\n 21:44 [hgb] 谁 掉 在 这 石 头 上 ， 必 要 跌 碎 。 这 石 头 掉 在 谁 的 身 上 ， 就 要 把 谁 砸 得 稀 烂 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. \\n\\n [bbe] Any man falling on this stone will be broken, but he on whom it comes down will be crushed to dust. \\n\\n 21:45 [hgb] 祭 司 长 和 法 利 赛 人 ， 听 见 他 的 比 喻 ， 就 看 出 他 是 指 着 他 们 说 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them. \\n\\n [bbe] And when his stories came to the ears of the chief priests and the Pharisees, they saw that he was talking of them. \\n\\n 21:46 [hgb] 他 们 想 要 捉 拿 他 ， 只 是 怕 众 人 ， 因 为 众 人 以 他 为 先 知 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet. \\n\\n [bbe] And though they had a desire to take him, they were in fear of the people, because in their eyes he was a prophet. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2116.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
