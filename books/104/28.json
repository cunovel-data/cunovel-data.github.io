Come, see the place where the Lord lay. \n [bbe] He is not here, for he has come to life again, even as he said. Come, see the Lord\u0027s resting-place. \n 28:7 [hgb] 快 去 告 诉 他 的 门 徒 ， 说 他 从 死 里 复 活 了 ， 并 且 在 你 们 以 先 往 加 利 利 去 ， 在 那 里 你 们 要 见 他 。 看 哪 ， 我 已 经 告 诉 你 们 了 。 \n [kjv] And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. \n [bbe] And go quickly and give his disciples the news that he has come back from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him, as I have said to you. \n 28:8 [hgb] 妇 女 们 就 急 忙 离 开 坟 墓 ， 又 害 怕 ， 又 大 大 地 欢 喜 ， 跑 去 要 报 给 他 的 门 徒 。 \n [kjv] And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. \n [bbe] And they went away quickly, with fear and great joy, to give his disciples the news. \n 28:9 [hgb] 忽 然 耶 稣 遇 见 她 们 ， 说 ， 愿 你 们 平 安 。 她 们 就 上 前 抱 住 他 的 脚 拜 他 。 \n [kjv] And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. \n [bbe] And on the way, Jesus came to them, saying, Be glad. And they came and put their hands on his feet, and gave him worship. \n 28:10 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 她 们 说 ， 不 要 害 怕 ， 你 们 去 告 诉 我 的 弟 兄 ， 叫 他 们 往 加 利 利 去 ， 在 那 里 必 见 我 。 \n [kjv] Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. \n [bbe] Then said Jesus to them, Have no fear: go and give word to my brothers to go into Galilee, and there they will see me. \n 28:11 [hgb] 他 们 去 的 时 候 ， 看 守 的 兵 ， 有 几 个 进 城 去 ， 将 所 经 历 的 事 ， 都 报 给 祭 司 长 。 \n [kjv] Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. \n [bbe] Now, while they were going, some of the watchmen came into the town and gave news to the chief priests of all the things which had taken place. \n 28:12 [hgb] 祭 司 长 和 长 老 聚 集 商 议 ， 就 拿 许 多 银 钱 给 兵 丁 说 ， \n [kjv] And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, \n [bbe] And when they had come together with those in authority, and had made their decision, they gave much money to the watchmen, saying, \n 28:13 [hgb] 你 们 要 这 样 说 ， 夜 间 我 们 睡 觉 的 时 候 ， 他 的 门 徒 来 把 他 偷 去 了 。 \n [kjv] Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. \n [bbe] Say, His disciples came by night and took him away secretly while we were sleeping. \n 28:14 [hgb] 倘 若 这 话 被 巡 抚 听 见 ， 有 我 们 劝 他 ， 保 你 们 无 事 。 \n [kjv] And if this come to the governor\u0027s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. \n [bbe] And if this comes to the ruler\u0027s ears, we will see that he does not make you responsible. \n 28:15 [hgb] 兵 丁 受 了 银 钱 ， 就 照 所 嘱 咐 他 们 的 去 行 。 这 话 就 传 说 在 犹 太 人 中 间 ， 直 到 今 日 。 \n [kjv] So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. \n [bbe] So they took the money, and did as they had been ordered: and this account has been current among the Jews till the present time. \n 28:16 [hgb] 十 一 个 门 徒 往 加 利 利 去 ， 到 了 耶 稣 约 定 的 山 上 。 \n [kjv] Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. \n [bbe] But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had given them orders to go. \n 28:17 [hgb] 他 们 见 了 耶 稣 就 拜 他 。 然 而 还 有 人 疑 惑 。 \n [kjv] And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. \n [bbe] And when they saw him they gave him worship: but some were in doubt. \n 28:18 [hgb] 耶 稣 进 前 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 天 上 ， 地 下 所 有 的 权 柄 ， 都 赐 给 我 了 。 \n [kjv] And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. \n [bbe] And Jesus came to them and said, All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. \n 28:19 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 要 去 ， 使 万 民 作 我 的 门 徒 ， 奉 父 子 圣 灵 的 名 ， 给 他 们 施 洗 。 （ 或 作 给 他 们 施 洗 归 于 父 子 圣 灵 的 名 ） \n [kjv] Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: \n [bbe] Go then, and make disciples of all the nations, giving them baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: \n 28:20 [hgb] 凡 我 所 吩 咐 你 们 的 ， 都 教 训 他 们 遵 守 ， 我 就 常 与 你 们 同 在 ， 直 到 世 界 的 末 了 。 \n [kjv] Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. \n [bbe] Teaching them to keep all the rules which I have given you: and see, I am ever with you, even to the end of the world. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2123.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
