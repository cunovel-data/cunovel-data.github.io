Go out to him. \\n\\n 25:7 [hgb] 那 些 童 女 就 都 起 来 收 拾 灯 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. \\n\\n [bbe] Then all those virgins got up, and made ready their lights. \\n\\n 25:8 [hgb] 愚 拙 的 对 聪 明 的 说 ， 请 分 点 油 给 我 们 。 因 为 我 们 的 灯 要 灭 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. \\n\\n [bbe] And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lights are going out. \\n\\n 25:9 [hgb] 聪 明 的 回 答 说 ， 恐 怕 不 够 你 我 用 的 。 不 如 你 们 自 己 到 卖 油 的 那 里 去 买 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. \\n\\n [bbe] But the wise made answer, saying, There may not be enough for us and you; it would be better for you to go to the traders and get oil for yourselves. \\n\\n 25:10 [hgb] 她 们 去 买 的 时 候 ， 新 郎 到 了 。 那 预 备 好 了 的 ， 同 他 进 去 坐 席 。 门 就 关 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. \\n\\n [bbe] And while they went to get oil, the master came; and those who were ready went in with him to the feast: and the door was shut. \\n\\n 25:11 [hgb] 其 余 的 童 女 ， 随 后 也 来 了 ， 说 ， 主 阿 ， 主 阿 ， 给 我 们 开 门 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. \\n\\n [bbe] After that the other virgins came, saying, Lord, Lord, let us in. \\n\\n 25:12 [hgb] 他 却 回 答 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 我 不 认 识 你 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. \\n\\n [bbe] But he made answer and said, Truly I say to you, I have no knowledge of you. \\n\\n 25:13 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 要 儆 醒 ， 因 为 那 日 子 ， 那 时 辰 ， 你 们 不 知 道 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. \\n\\n [bbe] Keep watch, then, because you are not certain of the day or of the hour. \\n\\n 25:14 [hgb] 天 国 又 好 比 一 个 人 要 往 外 国 去 ， 就 叫 了 仆 人 来 ， 把 他 的 家 业 交 给 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. \\n\\n [bbe] For it is as when a man, about to take a journey, got his servants together, and gave them his property. \\n\\n 25:15 [hgb] 按 着 各 人 的 才 干 ， 给 他 们 银 子 。 一 个 给 了 五 千 ， 一 个 给 了 二 千 ， 一 个 给 了 一 千 。 就 往 外 国 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. \\n\\n [bbe] And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to everyone as he was able; and he went on his journey. \\n\\n 25:16 [hgb] 那 领 五 千 的 ， 随 即 拿 去 做 买 卖 ， 另 外 赚 了 五 千 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents. \\n\\n [bbe] Straight away he who had been given the five talents went and did trade with them, and made five more. \\n\\n 25:17 [hgb] 那 领 二 千 的 ， 也 照 样 另 赚 了 二 千 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two. \\n\\n [bbe] In the same way he who had been given the two got two more. \\n\\n 25:18 [hgb] 但 那 领 一 千 的 ， 去 掘 开 地 ， 把 主 人 的 银 子 埋 藏 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord\u0027s money. \\n\\n [bbe] But he who was given the one went away and put it in a hole in the earth, and kept his lord\u0027s money in a secret place. \\n\\n 25:19 [hgb] 过 了 许 久 ， 那 些 仆 人 的 主 人 来 了 ， 和 他 们 算 账 。 \\n\\n [kjv] After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. \\n\\n [bbe] Now after a long time the lord of those servants comes, and makes up his account with them. \\n\\n 25:20 [hgb] 那 领 五 千 银 子 的 ， 又 带 着 那 另 外 的 五 千 来 ， 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 交 给 我 五 千 银 子 ， 请 看 ， 我 又 赚 了 五 千 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. \\n\\n [bbe] And he who had the five talents came with his other five talents, saying, Lord, you gave into my care five talents: see, I have got five more. \\n\\n 25:21 [hgb] 主 人 说 ， 好 ， 你 这 又 良 善 又 忠 心 的 仆 人 。 你 在 不 多 的 事 上 有 忠 心 ， 我 要 把 许 多 事 派 你 管 理 。 可 以 进 来 享 受 你 主 人 的 快 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. \\n\\n [bbe] His lord said to him, Well done, good and true servant: you have been true in a small thing, I will give you control over great things: take your part in the joy of your lord. \\n\\n 25:22 [hgb] 那 领 二 千 的 也 来 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 交 给 我 二 千 银 子 ， 请 看 ， 我 又 赚 了 二 千 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. \\n\\n [bbe] And he who had the two talents came and said, Lord, you gave into my care two talents: see, I have got two more. \\n\\n 25:23 [hgb] 主 人 说 ， 好 ， 你 这 又 良 善 又 忠 心 的 仆 人 。 你 在 不 多 的 事 上 有 忠 心 ， 我 要 把 许 多 事 派 你 管 理 。 可 以 进 来 享 受 你 主 人 的 快 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. \\n\\n [bbe] His lord said to him, Well done, good and true servant: you have been true in a small thing, I will give you control over great things: take your part in the joy of your lord. \\n\\n 25:24 [hgb] 那 领 一 千 的 ， 也 来 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 知 道 你 是 忍 心 的 人 ， 没 有 种 的 地 方 要 收 割 ， 没 有 散 的 地 方 要 聚 敛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: \\n\\n [bbe] And he who had had the one talent came and said, Lord, I had knowledge that you are a hard man, getting in grain where you have not put seed, and making profits for which you have done no work: \\n\\n 25:25 [hgb] 我 就 害 怕 ， 去 把 你 的 一 千 银 子 埋 藏 在 地 里 。 请 看 ， 你 的 原 银 子 在 这 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine. \\n\\n [bbe] And I was in fear, and went away, and put your talent in the earth: here is what is yours. \\n\\n 25:26 [hgb] 主 人 回 答 说 ， 你 这 又 恶 又 懒 的 仆 人 ， 你 既 知 道 我 没 有 种 的 地 方 要 收 割 ， 没 有 散 的 地 方 要 聚 敛 。 \\n\\n [kjv] His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: \\n\\n [bbe] But his lord in answer said to him, You are a bad and unready servant; if you had knowledge that I get in grain where I did not put seed, and make profits for which I have done no work, \\n\\n 25:27 [hgb] 就 当 把 我 的 银 子 放 给 兑 换 银 钱 的 人 ， 到 我 来 的 时 候 ， 可 以 连 本 带 利 收 回 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. \\n\\n [bbe] Why, then, did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I would have got back what is mine with interest? \\n\\n 25:28 [hgb] 夺 过 他 这 一 千 来 ， 给 那 有 一 万 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. \\n\\n [bbe] Take away, then, his talent and give it to him who has the ten talents. \\n\\n 25:29 [hgb] 因 为 凡 有 的 ， 还 要 加 给 他 ， 叫 他 有 余 。 没 有 的 ， 连 他 所 有 的 ， 也 要 夺 过 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. \\n\\n [bbe] For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have more: but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. \\n\\n 25:30 [hgb] 把 这 无 用 的 仆 人 ， 丢 在 外 面 黑 暗 里 。 在 那 里 必 要 哀 哭 切 齿 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \\n\\n [bbe] And put out the servant who is of no profit into the outer dark: there will be weeping and cries of sorrow. \\n\\n 25:31 [hgb] 当 人 子 在 他 荣 耀 里 同 着 众 天 使 降 临 的 时 候 ， 要 坐 在 他 荣 耀 的 宝 座 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: \\n\\n [bbe] But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he be seated in his glory: \\n\\n 25:32 [hgb] 万 民 都 要 聚 集 在 他 面 前 。 他 要 把 他 们 分 别 出 来 ， 好 像 牧 羊 的 分 别 绵 羊 、 山 羊 一 般 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: \\n\\n [bbe] And before him all the nations will come together; and they will be parted one from another, as the sheep are parted from the goats by the keeper. \\n\\n 25:33 [hgb] 把 绵 羊 安 置 在 右 边 ， 山 羊 在 左 边 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. \\n\\n [bbe] And he will put the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. \\n\\n 25:34 [hgb] 于 是 王 要 向 那 右 边 的 说 ， 你 们 这 蒙 我 父 赐 福 的 ， 可 来 承 受 那 创 世 以 来 为 你 们 所 预 备 的 国 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: \\n\\n [bbe] Then will the King say to those on his right, Come, you who have the blessing of my Father, into the kingdom made ready for you before the world was: \\n\\n 25:35 [hgb] 因 为 我 饿 了 ， 你 们 给 我 吃 。 渴 了 ， 你 们 给 我 喝 。 我 作 客 旅 ， 你 们 留 我 住 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: \\n\\n [bbe] For I was in need of food, and you gave it to me: I was in need of drink, and you gave it to me: I was wandering, and you took me in; \\n\\n 25:36 [hgb] 我 赤 身 露 体 ， 你 们 给 我 穿 。 我 病 了 ， 你 们 看 顾 我 。 我 在 监 里 ， 你 们 来 看 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. \\n\\n [bbe] I had no clothing, and you gave it to me: when I was ill, or in prison, you came to me. \\n\\n 25:37 [hgb] 义 人 就 回 答 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 们 什 么 时 候 见 你 饿 了 给 你 吃 ， 渴 了 给 你 喝 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? \\n\\n [bbe] Then will the upright make answer to him, saying, Lord, when did we see you in need of food, and give it to you? or in need of drink, and give it to you? \\n\\n 25:38 [hgb] 什 么 时 候 见 你 作 客 旅 留 你 住 ， 或 是 赤 身 露 体 给 你 穿 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? \\n\\n [bbe] And when did we see you wandering, and take you in? or without clothing, and give it to you? \\n\\n 25:39 [hgb] 又 什 么 时 候 见 你 病 了 ， 或 是 在 监 里 ， 来 看 你 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? \\n\\n [bbe] And when did we see you ill, or in prison, and come to you? \\n\\n 25:40 [hgb] 王 要 回 答 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 这 些 事 你 们 既 作 在 我 这 弟 兄 中 一 个 最 小 的 身 上 ， 就 是 作 在 我 身 上 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. \\n\\n [bbe] And the King will make answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Because you did it to the least of these my brothers, you did it to me. \\n\\n 25:41 [hgb] 王 又 要 向 那 左 边 的 说 ， 你 们 这 被 咒 诅 的 人 ， 离 开 我 ， 进 入 那 为 魔 鬼 和 他 的 使 者 所 预 备 的 永 火 里 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: \\n\\n [bbe] Then will he say to those on the left, Go from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire which is ready for the Evil One and his angels: \\n\\n 25:42 [hgb] 因 为 我 饿 了 ， 你 们 不 给 我 吃 。 渴 了 ， 你 们 不 给 我 喝 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: \\n\\n [bbe] For I was in need of food, and you gave it not to me; I was in need of drink, and you gave it not to me: \\n\\n 25:43 [hgb] 我 作 客 旅 ， 你 们 不 留 我 住 。 我 赤 身 露 体 ， 你 们 不 给 我 穿 。 我 病 了 ， 我 在 监 里 ， 你 们 不 来 看 顾 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. \\n\\n [bbe] I was wandering, and you took me not in; without clothing, and you gave me no clothing; ill, and in prison, and you came not to me. \\n\\n 25:44 [hgb] 他 们 也 要 回 答 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 们 什 么 时 候 见 你 饿 了 ， 或 渴 了 ， 或 作 客 旅 ， 或 赤 身 露 体 ， 或 病 了 ， 或 在 监 里 ， 不 伺 候 你 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? \\n\\n [bbe] Then will they make answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you in need of food or drink, or wandering, or without clothing, or ill, or in prison, and did not take care of you? \\n\\n 25:45 [hgb] 王 要 回 答 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 这 些 事 你 们 既 不 作 在 我 这 弟 兄 中 一 个 最 小 的 身 上 ， 就 是 不 作 在 我 身 上 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. \\n\\n [bbe] Then will he make answer to them, saying, Truly I say to you, Because you did it not to the least of these, you did it not to me. \\n\\n 25:46 [hgb] 这 些 人 要 往 永 刑 里 去 。 那 些 义 人 要 往 永 生 里 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. \\n\\n [bbe] And these will go away into eternal punishment; but the upright into eternal life. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2120.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
