and he put him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him, \\n\\n 4:6 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 你 若 是 神 的 儿 子 ， 可 以 跳 下 去 。 因 为 经 上 记 着 说 ， 主 要 为 你 吩 咐 他 的 使 者 ， 用 手 托 着 你 ， 免 得 你 的 脚 碰 在 石 头 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. \\n\\n [bbe] If you are the Son of God, let yourself go down; for it is in the Writings, He will give his angels care over you; and, In their hands they will keep you up, so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone. \\n\\n 4:7 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 经 上 又 记 着 说 ， 不 可 试 探 主 你 的 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. \\n\\n [bbe] Jesus said to him, Again it is in the Writings, You may not put the Lord your God to the test. \\n\\n 4:8 [hgb] 魔 鬼 又 带 他 上 了 一 座 最 高 的 山 ， 将 世 上 的 万 国 ， 与 万 国 的 荣 华 ， 都 指 给 他 看 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; \\n\\n [bbe] Again, the Evil One took him up to a very high mountain, and let him see all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them; \\n\\n 4:9 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 你 若 俯 伏 拜 我 ， 我 就 把 这 一 切 都 赐 给 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to him, All these things will I give you, if you will go down on your face and give me worship. \\n\\n 4:10 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 撒 但 退 去 吧 。 （ 撒 但 就 是 抵 挡 的 意 思 ， 乃 魔 鬼 的 别 名 ） 因 为 经 上 记 着 说 ， 当 拜 主 你 的 神 ， 单 要 事 奉 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. \\n\\n [bbe] Then said Jesus to him, Away, Satan: for it is in the Writings, Give worship to the Lord your God and be his servant only. \\n\\n 4:11 [hgb] 于 是 魔 鬼 离 了 耶 稣 ， 有 天 使 来 伺 候 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the Evil One went away from him, and angels came and took care of him. \\n\\n 4:12 [hgb] 耶 稣 听 见 约 翰 下 了 监 ， 就 退 到 加 利 利 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; \\n\\n [bbe] Now when it came to his ears that John had been put in prison, he went away to Galilee; \\n\\n 4:13 [hgb] 后 又 离 开 拿 撒 勒 ， 往 迦 百 农 去 ， 就 住 在 那 里 。 那 地 方 靠 海 ， 在 西 布 伦 和 拿 弗 他 利 的 边 界 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: \\n\\n [bbe] And going away from Nazareth, he came and made his living-place in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the country of Zebulun and Naphtali: \\n\\n 4:14 [hgb] 这 是 要 应 验 先 知 以 赛 亚 的 话 ， \\n\\n [kjv] That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, \\n\\n [bbe] So that the word of the prophet Isaiah might come true, \\n\\n 4:15 [hgb] 说 ， 西 布 伦 地 ， 拿 弗 他 利 地 ， 就 是 沿 海 的 路 ， 约 但 河 外 ， 外 邦 人 的 加 利 利 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; \\n\\n [bbe] The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, the other side of Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, \\n\\n 4:16 [hgb] 那 坐 在 黑 暗 里 的 百 姓 ， 看 见 了 大 光 ， 坐 在 死 荫 之 地 的 人 ， 有 光 发 现 照 着 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. \\n\\n [bbe] The people who were in the dark saw a great light, and to those in the land of the shade of death did the dawn come up. \\n\\n 4:17 [hgb] 从 那 时 候 耶 稣 就 传 起 道 来 ， 说 ， 天 国 近 了 ， 你 们 应 当 悔 改 。 \\n\\n [kjv] From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. \\n\\n [bbe] From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. \\n\\n 4:18 [hgb] 耶 稣 在 加 利 利 海 边 行 走 ， 看 见 弟 兄 二 人 ， 就 是 那 称 呼 彼 得 的 西 门 ， 和 他 兄 弟 安 得 烈 ， 在 海 里 撒 网 。 他 们 本 是 打 鱼 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. \\n\\n [bbe] And when he was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon, whose other name was Peter, and Andrew, his brother, who were putting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. \\n\\n 4:19 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 来 跟 从 我 ， 我 要 叫 你 们 得 人 如 得 鱼 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men. \\n\\n 4:20 [hgb] 他 们 就 立 刻 舍 了 网 ， 跟 从 了 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. \\n\\n [bbe] And straight away they let go the nets and went after him. \\n\\n 4:21 [hgb] 从 那 里 往 前 走 ， 又 看 见 弟 兄 二 人 ， 就 是 西 庇 太 的 儿 子 雅 各 ， 和 他 兄 弟 约 翰 ， 同 他 们 的 父 亲 西 庇 太 在 船 上 补 网 。 耶 稣 就 招 呼 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. \\n\\n [bbe] And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, in the boat with their father, stitching up their nets; and he said, Come. \\n\\n 4:22 [hgb] 他 们 立 刻 舍 了 船 ， 别 了 父 亲 ， 跟 从 了 耶 稣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him. \\n\\n [bbe] And they went straight from the boat and their father and came after him. \\n\\n 4:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 走 遍 加 利 利 ， 在 各 会 堂 里 教 训 人 ， 传 天 国 的 福 音 ， 医 治 百 姓 各 样 的 病 症 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus went about in all Galilee, teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the good news of the kingdom, and making well those who were ill with any disease among the people. \\n\\n 4:24 [hgb] 他 的 名 声 就 传 遍 了 叙 利 亚 。 那 里 的 人 把 一 切 害 病 的 ， 就 是 害 各 样 疾 病 ， 各 样 疼 痛 的 ， 和 被 鬼 附 的 ， 癫 痫 的 ， 瘫 痪 的 ， 都 带 了 来 ， 耶 稣 就 治 好 了 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them. \\n\\n [bbe] And news of him went out through all Syria; and they took to him all who were ill with different diseases and pains, those having evil spirits and those who were off their heads, and those who had no power of moving. And he made them well. \\n\\n 4:25 [hgb] 当 下 ， 有 许 多 人 从 加 利 利 ， 低 加 波 利 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 犹 太 ， 约 但 河 外 ， 来 跟 着 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan. \\n\\n [bbe] And there went after him great numbers from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from the other side of Jordan. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2099.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
