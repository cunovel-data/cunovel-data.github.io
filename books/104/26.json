{"id":2600,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"26:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 完 了 这 一 切 的 话 ， 就 对 门 徒 说 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, \n [bbe] And when Jesus had come to the end of all these words, he said to his disciples, \n 26:2 [hgb] 你 们 知 道 过 两 天 是 逾 越 节 ， 人 子 将 要 被 交 给 人 ， 钉 在 十 字 架 上 。 \n [kjv] Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified. \n [bbe] After two days is the Passover, and the Son of man will be given up to the death of the cross. \n 26:3 [hgb] 那 时 ， 祭 司 长 和 民 间 的 长 老 ， 聚 集 在 大 祭 司 称 为 该 亚 法 的 院 里 。 \n [kjv] Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, \n [bbe] Then the chief priests and the rulers of the people came together in the house of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas. \n 26:4 [hgb] 大 家 商 议 ， 要 用 诡 计 拿 住 耶 稣 杀 他 。 \n [kjv] And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him. \n [bbe] And they made designs together to take Jesus by some trick, and put him to death. \n 26:5 [hgb] 只 是 说 ， 当 节 的 日 子 不 可 ， 恐 怕 民 间 生 乱 。 \n [kjv] But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. \n [bbe] But they said, Not while the feast is going on, for fear of trouble among the people. \n 26:6 [hgb] 耶 稣 在 伯 大 尼 长 大 麻 疯 的 西 门 家 里 ， \n [kjv] Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, \n [bbe] Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, \n 26:7 [hgb] 有 一 个 女 人 ， 拿 着 一 玉 瓶 极 贵 的 香 膏 来 ， 趁 耶 稣 坐 席 的 时 候 ， 浇 在 他 的 头 上 。 \n [kjv] There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. \n [bbe] There came to him a woman having a bottle of perfume of great price, and she put the perfume on his head when he was seated at table. \n 26:8 [hgb] 门 徒 看 见 ， 就 很 不 喜 悦 ， 说 ， 何 用 这 样 的 枉 费 呢 ？ \n [kjv] But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? \n [bbe] But when the disciples saw it they were angry, saying, To what purpose is this waste? \n 26:9 [hgb] 这 香 膏 可 以 卖 许 多 钱 ， 周 济 穷 人 。 \n [kjv] For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. \n [bbe] For we might have got much money for this and given it to the poor. \n 26:10 [hgb] 耶 稣 看 出 他 们 的 意 思 ， 就 说 ， 为 什 么 难 为 这 女 人 呢 ？ 她 在 我 身 上 作 的 ， 是 一 件 美 事 。 \n [kjv] When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. \n [bbe] But Jesus, seeing it, said to them, Why are you troubling the woman? she has done a kind act to me. \n 26:11 [hgb] 因 为 常 有 穷 人 和 你 们 同 在 。 只 是 你 们 不 常 有 我 。 \n [kjv] For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. \n [bbe] For the poor you have ever with you, but me you have not for ever. \n 26:12 [hgb] 她 将 这 香 膏 浇 在 我 身 上 ， 是 为 我 安 葬 作 的 。 \n [kjv] For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. \n [bbe] For in putting this perfume on my body, she did it to make me ready for my last resting-place. \n 26:13 [hgb] 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 普 天 之 下 ， 无 论 在 什 么 地 方 传 这 福 音 ， 也 要 述 说 这 女 人 所 行 的 ， 作 个 纪 念 。 \n [kjv] Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. \n [bbe] Truly I say to you, Wherever this good news goes out in all the world, what this woman has done will be talked of in memory of her. \n 26:14 [hgb] 当 下 ， 十 二 门 徒 里 ， 有 一 个 称 为 加 略 人 犹 大 的 ， 去 见 祭 司 长 说 ， \n [kjv] Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, \n [bbe] Then one of the twelve, who was named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, \n 26:15 [hgb] 我 把 他 交 给 你 们 ， 你 们 愿 意 给 我 多 少 钱 。 他 们 就 给 了 他 三 十 块 钱 。 \n [kjv] And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. \n [bbe] What will you give me, if I give him up to you? And the price was fixed at thirty bits of silver. \n 26:16 [hgb] 从 那 时 候 ， 他 就 找 机 会 ， 要 把 耶 稣 交 给 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. \n [bbe] And from that time he was watching for a chance to give him into their hands. \n 26:17 [hgb] 除 酵 节 的 第 一 天 ， 门 徒 来 问 耶 稣 说 ， 你 吃 逾 越 节 的 筵 席 ， 要 我 们 在 哪 里 给 你 预 备 ？ \n [kjv] Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? \n [bbe] Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where are we to make ready for you to take the Passover meal? \n 26:18 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 进 城 去 ， 到 某 人 那 里 ， 对 他 说 ， 夫 子 说 ， 我 的 时 候 快 到 了 。 我 与 门 徒 要 在 你 家 里 守 逾 越 节 。 \n [kjv] And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. \n [bbe] And he said to them, Go into the town to such a man, and say to him, The Master says, My time is near: I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples. \n 26:19 [hgb] 门 徒 遵 着 耶 稣 所 吩 咐 的 就 去 预 备 了 逾 越 节 的 筵 席 。 \n [kjv] And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. \n [bbe] And the disciples did as Jesus had said to them; and they made ready the Passover. \n 26:20 [hgb] 到 了 晚 上 ， 耶 稣 和 十 二 个 门 徒 坐 席 。 \n [kjv] Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. \n [bbe] Now when evening was come, he was seated at table with the twelve disciples; \n 26:21 [hgb] 正 吃 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 你 们 中 间 有 一 个 人 要 卖 我 了 。 \n [kjv] And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. \n [bbe] And while they were taking food, he said, Truly I say to you that one of you will be false to me. \n 26:22 [hgb] 他 们 就 甚 忧 愁 ， 一 个 一 个 地 问 他 说 ， 主 ， 是 我 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? \n [bbe] And they were very said, and said to him, one by one, Is it I, Lord? \n 26:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 同 我 蘸 手 在 盘 子 里 的 ， 就 是 他 要 卖 我 。 \n [kjv] And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. \n [bbe] And he made answer and said, He who puts his hand into the plate with me, the same will be false to me. \n 26:24 [hgb] 人 子 必 要 去 世 ， 正 如 经 上 指 着 他 所 写 的 ， 但 卖 人 子 的 人 有 祸 了 。 那 人 不 生 在 世 上 倒 好 。 \n [kjv] The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. \n [bbe] The Son of man goes, even as the Writings say of him: but a curse is on that man through whom the Son of man is given up; it would have been well for that man if he had never come into the world. \n 26:25 [hgb] 卖 耶 稣 的 犹 大 问 他 说 ， 拉 比 ， 是 我 吗 ？ 耶 稣 说 ， 你 说 的 是 。 \n [kjv] Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. \n [bbe] And Judas, who was false to him, made answer and said, Is it I, Master? He says to him, Yes. \n 26:26 [hgb] 他 们 吃 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 拿 起 饼 来 ， 祝 福 ， 就 掰 开 ， 递 给 门 徒 ， 说 ， 你 们 拿 着 吃 ， 这 是 我 的 身 体 。 \n [kjv] And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. \n [bbe] And when they were taking food, Jesus took bread and, after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to the disciples and said, Take it; this is my body. \n 26:27 [hgb] 又 拿 起 杯 来 ， 祝 谢 了 ， 递 给 他 们 ， 说 ， 你 们 都 喝 这 个 。 \n [kjv] And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; \n [bbe] And he took a cup and, having given praise, he gave it to them, saying, \n 26:28 [hgb] 因 为 这 是 我 立 约 的 血 ， 为 多 人 流 出 来 ， 使 罪 得 赦 。 \n [kjv] For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. \n [bbe] Take of it, all of you, for this is my blood of the testament, which is given for men for the forgiveness of sins. \n 26:29 [hgb] 但 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 从 今 以 后 ， 我 不 再 喝 这 葡 萄 汁 ， 直 到 我 在 我 父 的 国 里 ， 同 你 们 喝 新 的 那 日 子 。 \n [kjv] But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father\u0027s kingdom. \n [bbe] But I say to you that from now I will not take of this fruit of the vine, till that day when I take it new with you in my Father\u0027s kingdom. \n 26:30 [hgb] 他 们 唱 了 诗 ， 就 出 来 往 橄 榄 山 去 。 \n [kjv] And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. \n [bbe] And after a song of praise to God, they went out to the Mountain of Olives. \n 26:31 [hgb] 那 时 ， 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 今 夜 你 们 为 我 的 缘 故 ， 都 要 跌 倒 。 因 为 经 上 记 着 说 ， 我 要 击 打 牧 人 ， 羊 就 分 散 了 。 \n [kjv] Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. \n [bbe] Then said Jesus to them, All of you will be turned away from me this night: for it is said in the Writings, I will put to death the keeper of the sheep, and the sheep of the flock will be put to flight. \n 26:32 [hgb] 但 我 复 活 以 后 ， 要 在 你 们 以 先 往 加 利 利 去 。 \n [kjv] But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. \n [bbe] But after I am come back from the dead, I will go before you into Galilee. \n 26:33 [hgb] 彼 得 说 ， 众 人 虽 然 为 你 的 缘 故 跌 倒 ， 我 却 永 不 跌 倒 。 \n [kjv] Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. \n [bbe] But Peter made answer and said to him, Though all may be turned away from you, I will never be turned away. \n 26:34 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 ， 今 夜 鸡 叫 以 先 ， 你 要 三 次 不 认 我 。 \n [kjv] Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. \n [bbe] Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that this night, before the hour of the cock\u0027s cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me. \n 26:35 [hgb] 彼 得 说 ， 我 就 是 必 须 和 你 同 死 ， 也 总 不 能 不 认 你 。 众 门 徒 都 是 这 样 说 。 \n [kjv] Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. \n [bbe] Peter says to him, Even if I am put to death with you, I will not be false to you. So said all the disciples. \n 26:36 [hgb] 耶 稣 同 门 徒 来 到 一 个 地 方 ， 名 叫 客 西 马 尼 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 坐 在 这 里 ， 等 我 到 那 边 去 祷 告 。 \n [kjv] Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. \n [bbe] Then comes Jesus with them to a place named Gethsemane, and says to his disciples, Be seated here, while I go over there for prayer. \n 26:37 [hgb] 于 是 带 着 彼 得 ， 和 西 庇 太 的 两 个 儿 子 同 去 ， 就 忧 愁 起 来 ， 极 其 难 过 。 \n [kjv] And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. \n [bbe] And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became sad and very troubled. \n 26:38 [hgb] 便 对 他 们 说 ， 我 心 里 甚 是 忧 伤 ， 几 乎 要 死 。 你 们 在 这 里 等 候 ， 和 我 一 同 儆 醒 。 \n [kjv] Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. \n [bbe] Then says he to them, My soul is very sad, even to death: keep watch with me here. \n 26:39 [hgb] 他 就 稍 往 前 走 ， 俯 伏 在 地 祷 告 说 ， 我 父 阿 ， 倘 若 可 行 ， 求 你 叫 这 杯 离 开 我 。 然 而 不 要 照 我 的 意 思 ， 只 要 照 你 的 意 思 。 \n [kjv] And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. \n [bbe] And he went forward a little, and falling down on his face in prayer, he said, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup go from me; but let not my pleasure, but yours be done. \n 26:40 [hgb] 来 到 门 徒 那 里 ， 见 他 们 睡 着 了 ， 就 对 彼 得 说 ， 怎 么 样 ， 你 们 不 能 同 我 儆 醒 片 时 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? \n [bbe] And he comes to the disciples, and sees that they are sleeping, and says to Peter, What, were you not able to keep watch with me one hour? \n 26:41 [hgb] 总 要 儆 醒 祷 告 ， 免 得 入 了 迷 惑 。 你 们 心 灵 固 然 愿 意 ， 肉 体 却 软 弱 了 。 \n [kjv] Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. \n [bbe] Keep watch with prayer, so that you may not be put to the test: the spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is feeble. \n 26:42 [hgb] 第 二 次 又 去 祷 告 说 ， 我 父 阿 ， 这 杯 若 不 能 离 开 我 ， 必 要 我 喝 ， 就 愿 你 的 意 旨 成 全 。 \n [kjv] He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. \n [bbe] Again, a second time he went away, and said in prayer, O my Father, if this may not go from me without my taking it, let your pleasure be done. \n 26:43 [hgb] 又 来 见 他 们 睡 着 了 ， 因 为 他 们 的 眼 睛 困 倦 。 \n [kjv] And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. \n [bbe] And he came again and saw them sleeping, for their eyes were tired. \n 26:44 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 离 开 他 们 去 了 。 第 三 次 祷 告 ， 说 的 话 还 是 与 先 前 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. \n [bbe] And he went away from them again, and a third time said the same prayer. \n 26:45 [hgb] 于 是 来 到 门 徒 那 里 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 现 在 你 们 仍 然 睡 觉 安 歇 吧 。 （ 吧 或 作 吗 ） 时 候 到 了 ， 人 子 被 卖 在 罪 人 手 里 了 。 \n [kjv] Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. \n [bbe] Then he comes to the disciples; and says to them, Go on sleeping now, and take your rest: for the hour is come, and the Son of man is given into the hands of evil men. \n 26:46 [hgb] 起 来 ， 我 们 走 吧 。 看 哪 ， 卖 我 的 人 近 了 。 \n [kjv] Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. \n [bbe] Up, let us be going: see, he who gives me up is near. \n 26:47 [hgb] 说 话 之 间 ， 那 十 二 个 门 徒 里 的 犹 大 来 了 ， 并 有 许 多 人 ， 带 着 刀 棒 ， 从 祭 司 长 和 民 间 的 长 老 那 里 ， 与 他 同 来 。 \n [kjv] And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. \n [bbe] And while he was still talking, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a band armed with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and those in authority over the people. \n 26:48 [hgb] 那 卖 耶 稣 的 ， 给 了 他 们 一 个 暗 号 ， 说 ， 我 与 谁 亲 嘴 ， 谁 就 是 他 。 你 们 可 以 拿 住 他 。 \n [kjv] Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. \n [bbe] Now the false one had given them a sign saying, The one to whom I give a kiss, that is he: take him. \n 26:49 [hgb] 犹 大 随 即 到 耶 稣 跟 前 说 ， 请 拉 比 安 。 就 与 他 亲 嘴 。 \n [kjv] And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. \n [bbe] And straight away he came to Jesus and said, Master! and gave him a kiss. \n 26:50 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 朋 友 ， 你 来 要 作 的 事 ， 就 作 吧 。 于 是 那 些 人 上 前 ， 下 手 拿 住 耶 稣 。 \n [kjv] And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. \n [bbe] And Jesus said to him, Friend, do that for which you have come. Then they came and put hands on Jesus, and took him. \n 26:51 [hgb] 有 跟 随 耶 稣 的 一 个 人 ， 伸 手 拔 出 刀 来 ， 将 大 祭 司 的 仆 人 砍 了 一 刀 ， 削 掉 了 他 一 个 耳 朵 。 \n [kjv] And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest\u0027s, and smote off his ear. \n [bbe] And one of those who were with Jesus put out his hand, and took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear. \n 26:52 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 收 刀 入 鞘 吧 。 凡 动 刀 的 ， 必 死 在 刀 下 。 \n [kjv] Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. \n [bbe] Then says Jesus to him, Put up your sword again into its place: for all those who take the sword will come to death by the sword. \n 26:53 [hgb] 你 想 我 不 能 求 我 父 ， 现 在 为 我 差 遣 十 二 营 多 天 使 来 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? \n [bbe] Does it not seem possible to you that if I make request to my Father he will even now send me an army of angels? \n 26:54 [hgb] 若 是 这 样 ， 经 上 所 说 ， 事 情 必 须 如 此 的 话 ， 怎 么 应 验 呢 ？ \n [kjv] But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? \n [bbe] But how then would the Writings come true, which say that so it has to be? \n 26:55 [hgb] 当 时 ， 耶 稣 对 众 人 说 ， 你 们 带 着 刀 棒 ， 出 来 拿 我 ， 如 同 拿 强 盗 吗 ？ 我 天 天 坐 在 殿 里 教 训 人 ， 你 们 并 没 有 拿 我 。 \n [kjv] In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. \n [bbe] In that hour Jesus said to the people, Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me? I was teaching every day in the Temple and you took me not. \n 26:56 [hgb] 但 这 一 切 的 事 成 就 了 ， 为 要 应 验 先 知 书 上 的 话 。 当 下 门 徒 都 离 开 他 逃 走 了 。 \n [kjv] But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. \n [bbe] But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets might come true. Then all his disciples went from him in flight. \n 26:57 [hgb] 拿 耶 稣 的 人 ， 把 他 带 到 大 祭 司 该 亚 法 那 里 去 。 文 士 和 长 老 ， 已 经 在 那 里 聚 会 。 \n [kjv] And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. \n [bbe] And those who had made Jesus prisoner took him away to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and those in authority over the people had come together. \n 26:58 [hgb] 彼 得 远 远 地 跟 着 耶 稣 ， 直 到 大 祭 司 的 院 子 ， 进 到 里 面 ， 就 和 差 役 同 坐 ， 要 看 这 事 到 底 怎 样 。 \n [kjv] But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest\u0027s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. \n [bbe] But Peter went after him at a distance, to the house of the high priest, and went in and took his seat with the servants, to see the end. \n 26:59 [hgb] 祭 司 长 和 全 公 会 ， 寻 找 假 见 证 ， 控 告 耶 稣 ， 要 治 死 他 。 \n [kjv] Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; \n [bbe] Now the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin were looking for false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death; \n 26:60 [hgb] 虽 有 好 些 人 来 作 假 见 证 ， 总 得 不 着 实 据 。 末 后 有 两 个 人 前 来 说 ， \n [kjv] But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, \n [bbe] And they were not able to get it, though a number of false witnesses came. \n 26:61 [hgb] 这 个 人 曾 说 ， 我 能 拆 毁 神 的 殿 ， 三 日 内 又 建 造 起 来 。 \n [kjv] And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. \n [bbe] But later there came two who said, This man said, I am able to give the Temple of God to destruction, and to put it up again in three days. \n 26:62 [hgb] 大 祭 司 就 站 起 来 ， 对 耶 稣 说 ， 你 什 么 都 不 回 答 吗 ？ 这 些 人 作 见 证 告 你 的 是 什 么 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? \n [bbe] And the high priest got up and said to him, Have you no answer? what is it which these say against you? \n 26:63 [hgb] 耶 稣 却 不 言 语 。 大 祭 司 对 他 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 神 ， 叫 你 起 誓 告 诉 我 们 ， 你 是 神 的 儿 子 基 督 不 是 。 \n [kjv] But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. \n [bbe] But Jesus said not a word. And the high priest said to him, I put you on oath, by the living God, that you will say to us if you are the Christ, the Son of God. \n 26:64 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 你 说 的 是 。 然 而 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 后 来 你 们 要 看 见 人 子 ， 坐 在 那 权 能 者 的 右 边 ， 驾 着 天 上 的 云 降 临 。 \n [kjv] Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. \n [bbe] Jesus says to him, You say so: but I say to you, From now you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. \n 26:65 [hgb] 大 祭 司 就 撕 开 衣 服 说 ， 他 说 了 僭 妄 的 话 ， 我 们 何 必 再 用 见 证 人 呢 ？ 这 僭 妄 的 话 ， 现 在 你 们 都 听 见 了 。 \n [kjv] Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. \n [bbe] Then the high priest, violently parting his robes, said, He has said evil against God: what more need have we of witnesses? for now his words against God have come to your ears: \n 26:66 [hgb] 你 们 的 意 见 如 何 ？ 他 们 回 答 说 ， 他 是 该 死 的 。 \n [kjv] What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. \n [bbe] What is your opinion? They made answer and said, It is right for him to be put to death. \n 26:67 [hgb] 他 们 就 吐 唾 沫 在 他 脸 上 ， 用 拳 头 打 他 。 也 有 用 手 掌 打 他 的 ， 说 ， \n [kjv] Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, \n [bbe] Then they put shame on him, and were cruel to him: and some gave him blows, saying, \n 26:68 [hgb] 基 督 阿 ， 你 是 先 知 ， 告 诉 我 们 打 你 的 是 谁 。 \n [kjv] Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? \n [bbe] Be a prophet, O Christ, and say who gave you a blow! \n 26:69 [hgb] 彼 得 在 外 面 院 子 里 坐 着 ， 有 一 个 使 女 前 来 说 ， 你 素 来 也 是 同 那 加 利 利 人 耶 稣 一 伙 的 。 \n [kjv] Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. \n [bbe] Now Peter was seated in the open square outside the house: and a servant-girl came to him, saying, You were with Jesus the Galilaean. \n 26:70 [hgb] 彼 得 在 众 人 面 前 却 不 承 认 ， 说 ， 我 不 知 道 你 说 的 是 什 么 。 \n [kjv] But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. \n [bbe] But he said before them all that it was false, saying, I have no knowledge of what you say. \n 26:71 [hgb] 既 出 去 ， 到 了 门 口 ， 又 有 一 个 使 女 看 见 他 ， 就 对 那 里 的 人 说 ， 这 个 人 也 是 同 拿 撒 勒 人 耶 稣 一 伙 的 。 \n [kjv] And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. \n [bbe] And when he had gone out into the doorway, another saw him and says to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the Nazarene. \n 26:72 [hgb] 彼 得 又 不 承 认 ， 并 且 起 誓 说 ， 我 不 认 得 那 个 人 。 \n [kjv] And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. \n [bbe] And again he said with an oath, I have no knowledge of the man. \n 26:73 [hgb] 过 了 不 多 的 时 候 ， 旁 边 站 着 的 人 前 来 ， 对 彼 得 说 ， 你 真 是 他 们 一 党 的 。 你 的 口 音 把 你 露 出 来 了 。 \n [kjv] And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. \n [bbe] And after a little time those who were near came and said to Peter, Truly you are one of them; because your talk is witness against you. \n 26:74 [hgb] 彼 得 就 发 咒 起 誓 地 说 ， 我 不 认 得 那 个 人 。 立 时 鸡 就 叫 了 。 \n [kjv] Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. \n [bbe] Then with curses and oaths he said, I have no knowledge of the man. And straight away there came the cry of a cock. \n 26:75 [hgb] 彼 得 想 起 耶 稣 所 说 的 话 ， 鸡 叫 以 先 ， 你 要 三 次 不 认 我 。 他 就 出 去 痛 哭 。 \n [kjv] And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. \n [bbe] And the word of Jesus came back to Peter, when he said, Before the hour of the cock\u0027s cry, you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me. And he went out, weeping bitterly. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2121.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
