We have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship. \n 2:3 [hgb] 希 律 王 听 见 了 ， 就 心 里 不 安 。 耶 路 撒 冷 合 城 的 人 ， 也 都 不 安 。 \n [kjv] When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. \n [bbe] And when it came to the ears of Herod the king, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. \n 2:4 [hgb] 他 就 召 齐 了 祭 司 长 和 民 间 的 文 士 ， 问 他 们 说 ， 基 督 当 生 在 何 处 。 \n [kjv] And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. \n [bbe] And he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, questioning them as to where the birth-place of the Christ would be. \n 2:5 [hgb] 他 们 回 答 说 ， 在 犹 太 的 伯 利 恒 。 因 为 有 先 知 记 着 说 ， \n [kjv] And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet, \n [bbe] And they said to him, In Beth-lehem of Judaea; for so it is said in the writings of the prophet, \n 2:6 [hgb] 犹 大 地 的 伯 利 恒 阿 ， 你 在 犹 大 诸 城 中 ， 并 不 是 最 小 的 。 因 为 将 来 有 一 位 君 王 ， 要 从 你 那 里 出 来 ， 牧 养 我 以 色 列 民 。 \n [kjv] And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. \n [bbe] You Beth-lehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the chiefs of Judah: out of you will come a ruler, who will be the keeper of my people Israel. \n 2:7 [hgb] 当 下 希 律 暗 暗 地 召 了 博 士 来 ， 细 问 那 星 是 什 么 时 候 出 现 的 。 \n [kjv] Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared. \n [bbe] Then Herod sent for the wise men privately, and put questions to them about what time the star had been seen. \n 2:8 [hgb] 就 差 他 们 往 伯 利 恒 去 ， 说 ， 你 们 去 仔 细 寻 访 那 小 孩 子 。 寻 到 了 ， 就 来 报 信 ， 我 也 好 去 拜 他 。 \n [kjv] And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also. \n [bbe] And he sent them to Beth-lehem and said, Go and make certain where the young child is; and when you have seen him, let me have news of it, so that I may come and give him worship. \n 2:9 [hgb] 他 们 听 见 王 的 话 ， 就 去 了 。 在 东 方 所 看 见 的 那 星 ， 忽 然 在 他 们 前 头 行 ， 直 行 到 小 孩 子 的 地 方 ， 就 在 上 头 停 住 了 。 \n [kjv] When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was. \n [bbe] And after hearing the king, they went on their way; and the star which they saw in the east went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the young child was. \n 2:10 [hgb] 他 们 看 见 那 星 ， 就 大 大 地 欢 喜 。 \n [kjv] When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. \n [bbe] And when they saw the star they were full of joy. \n 2:11 [hgb] 进 了 房 子 ， 看 见 小 孩 子 和 他 母 亲 马 利 亚 ， 就 俯 伏 拜 那 小 孩 子 ， 揭 开 宝 盒 ， 拿 黄 金 ， 乳 香 ， 没 药 为 礼 物 献 给 他 。 \n [kjv] And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. \n [bbe] And they came into the house, and saw the young child with Mary, his mother; and falling down on their faces they gave him worship; and from their store they gave him offerings of gold, perfume, and spices. \n 2:12 [hgb] 博 士 因 为 在 梦 中 被 主 指 示 ， 不 要 回 去 见 希 律 ， 就 从 别 的 路 回 本 地 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. \n [bbe] And it was made clear to them by God in a dream that they were not to go back to Herod; so they went into their country by another way. \n 2:13 [hgb] 他 们 去 后 ， 有 主 的 使 者 向 约 瑟 梦 中 显 现 ， 说 ， 起 来 ， 带 着 小 孩 子 同 他 母 亲 ， 逃 往 埃 及 ， 住 在 那 里 ， 等 我 吩 咐 你 。 因 为 希 律 必 寻 找 小 孩 子 要 除 灭 他 。 \n [kjv] And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. \n [bbe] And when they had gone, an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream, saying, Get up and take the young child and his mother, and go into Egypt, and do not go from there till I give you word; for Herod will be searching for the young child to put him to death. \n 2:14 [hgb] 约 瑟 就 起 来 ， 夜 间 带 着 小 孩 子 和 他 母 亲 往 埃 及 去 。 \n [kjv] When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: \n [bbe] So he took the young child and his mother by night, and went into Egypt; \n 2:15 [hgb] 住 在 那 里 ， 直 到 希 律 死 了 。 这 是 要 应 验 主 借 先 知 所 说 的 话 ， 说 ， 我 从 埃 及 召 出 我 的 儿 子 来 。 \n [kjv] And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. \n [bbe] And was there till the death of Herod; so that the word of the Lord through the prophet might come true, Out of Egypt have I sent for my son. \n 2:16 [hgb] 希 律 见 自 己 被 博 士 愚 弄 ， 就 大 大 发 怒 ， 差 人 将 伯 利 恒 城 里 ， 并 四 境 所 有 的 男 孩 ， 照 着 他 向 博 士 仔 细 查 问 的 时 候 ， 凡 两 岁 以 里 的 ， 都 杀 尽 了 。 \n [kjv] Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men. \n [bbe] Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was very angry; and he sent out, and put to death all the male children in Beth-lehem and in all the parts round about it, from two years old and under, acting on the knowledge which he had got with care from the wise men. \n 2:17 [hgb] 这 就 应 了 先 知 耶 利 米 的 话 ， 说 ， \n [kjv] Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, \n [bbe] Then the word of Jeremiah the prophet came true, \n 2:18 [hgb] 在 拉 玛 听 见 号 啕 大 哭 的 声 音 ， 是 拉 结 哭 她 儿 女 ， 不 肯 受 安 慰 ， 因 为 他 们 都 不 在 了 。 \n [kjv] In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. \n [bbe] In Ramah there was a sound of weeping and great sorrow, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted for their loss. \n 2:19 [hgb] 希 律 死 了 以 后 ， 有 主 的 使 者 ， 在 埃 及 向 约 瑟 梦 中 显 现 ， 说 ， \n [kjv] But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, \n [bbe] But when Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord came in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, \n 2:20 [hgb] 起 来 ， 带 着 小 孩 子 和 他 母 亲 往 以 色 列 地 去 。 因 为 要 害 小 孩 子 性 命 的 人 已 经 死 了 。 \n [kjv] Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child\u0027s life. \n [bbe] Saying, Get up and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: because they who were attempting to take the young child\u0027s life are dead. \n 2:21 [hgb] 约 瑟 就 起 来 ， 把 小 孩 子 和 他 母 亲 带 到 以 色 列 地 去 。 \n [kjv] And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. \n [bbe] And he got up, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. \n 2:22 [hgb] 只 因 听 见 亚 基 老 接 着 他 父 亲 希 律 作 了 犹 太 王 ， 就 怕 往 那 里 去 。 又 在 梦 中 被 主 指 示 ， 便 往 加 利 利 境 内 去 了 。 \n [kjv] But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: \n [bbe] But when it came to his ears that Archelaus was ruling over Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was in fear of going there; and God having given him news of the danger in a dream, he went out of the way into the country parts of Galilee. \n 2:23 [hgb] 到 了 一 座 城 ， 名 叫 拿 撒 勒 ， 就 住 在 那 里 。 这 是 要 应 验 先 知 所 说 ， 他 将 称 为 拿 撒 勒 人 的 话 了 。 \n [kjv] And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene. \n [bbe] And he came and was living in a town named Nazareth: so that the word of the prophets might come true, He will be named a Nazarene. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2097.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
