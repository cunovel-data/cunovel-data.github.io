And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that. \\n\\n [bbe] Saying, I have done wrong in giving into your hands an upright man. But they said, What is that to us? it is your business. \\n\\n 27:5 [hgb] 犹 大 就 把 那 银 钱 丢 在 殿 里 ， 出 去 吊 死 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. \\n\\n [bbe] And he put down the silver in the Temple and went out, and put himself to death by hanging. \\n\\n 27:6 [hgb] 祭 司 长 拾 起 银 钱 来 说 ， 这 是 血 价 ， 不 可 放 在 库 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood. \\n\\n [bbe] And the chief priests took the silver and said, It is not right to put it in the Temple store for it is the price of blood. \\n\\n 27:7 [hgb] 他 们 商 议 ， 就 用 那 银 钱 买 了 窑 户 的 一 块 田 ， 为 要 埋 葬 外 乡 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter\u0027s field, to bury strangers in. \\n\\n [bbe] And they made a decision to get with the silver the potter\u0027s field, as a place for the dead of other countries. \\n\\n 27:8 [hgb] 所 以 那 块 田 ， 直 到 今 日 还 叫 作 血 田 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day. \\n\\n [bbe] For this cause that field was named, The field of blood, to this day. \\n\\n 27:9 [hgb] 这 就 应 了 先 知 耶 利 米 的 话 ， 说 ， 他 们 用 那 三 十 块 钱 ， 就 是 被 估 定 之 人 的 价 钱 ， 是 以 色 列 人 中 所 估 定 的 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; \\n\\n [bbe] Then came true that which was said by Jeremiah the prophet, And they took the thirty bits of silver, the price of him who was valued by the children of Israel; \\n\\n 27:10 [hgb] 买 了 窑 户 的 一 块 田 。 这 是 照 着 主 所 吩 咐 我 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And gave them for the potter\u0027s field, as the Lord appointed me. \\n\\n [bbe] And they gave them for the potter\u0027s field, as I had word from the Lord. \\n\\n 27:11 [hgb] 耶 稣 站 在 巡 抚 面 前 ， 巡 抚 问 他 说 ， 你 是 犹 太 人 的 王 吗 ？ 耶 稣 说 ， 你 说 的 是 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus was before the ruler, who put a question to him, Are you the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, You say so. \\n\\n 27:12 [hgb] 他 被 祭 司 长 和 长 老 控 告 的 时 候 什 么 都 不 回 答 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. \\n\\n [bbe] But when the chief priests and those in authority made statements against him, he gave no answer. \\n\\n 27:13 [hgb] 彼 拉 多 就 对 他 说 ， 他 们 作 见 证 ， 告 你 这 么 多 的 事 ， 你 没 有 听 见 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? \\n\\n [bbe] Then says Pilate to him, Do you give no attention to what their witnesses say against you? \\n\\n 27:14 [hgb] 耶 稣 仍 不 回 答 ， 连 一 句 话 也 不 说 ， 以 致 巡 抚 甚 觉 希 奇 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly. \\n\\n [bbe] And he gave him no answer, not even a word: so that the ruler was greatly surprised. \\n\\n 27:15 [hgb] 巡 抚 有 一 个 常 例 ， 每 逢 这 节 期 ， 随 众 人 所 要 的 ， 释 放 一 个 囚 犯 给 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would. \\n\\n [bbe] Now at the feast it was the way for the ruler to let free to the people one prisoner, at their selection. \\n\\n 27:16 [hgb] 当 时 ， 有 一 个 出 名 的 囚 犯 叫 巴 拉 巴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas. \\n\\n [bbe] And they had then an important prisoner, whose name was Barabbas. \\n\\n 27:17 [hgb] 众 人 聚 集 的 时 候 ， 彼 拉 多 就 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 我 释 放 哪 一 个 给 你 们 ？ 是 巴 拉 巴 呢 ？ 是 称 为 基 督 的 耶 稣 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ? \\n\\n [bbe] So when they came together, Pilate said to them, Whom will you have? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is named Christ? \\n\\n 27:18 [hgb] 巡 抚 原 知 道 ， 他 们 是 因 为 嫉 妒 才 把 他 解 了 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. \\n\\n [bbe] For he saw that for envy they had given him up. \\n\\n 27:19 [hgb] 正 坐 堂 的 时 候 ， 他 的 夫 人 打 发 人 来 说 ， 这 义 人 的 事 ， 你 一 点 不 可 管 。 因 为 我 今 天 在 梦 中 ， 为 他 受 了 许 多 的 苦 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him. \\n\\n [bbe] And while he was on the judge\u0027s seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that upright man, for I have had much trouble this day in a dream because of him. \\n\\n 27:20 [hgb] 祭 司 长 和 长 老 ， 挑 唆 众 人 ， 求 释 放 巴 拉 巴 ， 除 灭 耶 稣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the chief priests and those in authority got the people to make request for Barabbas, and for Jesus to be put to death. \\n\\n 27:21 [hgb] 巡 抚 对 众 人 说 ， 这 两 个 人 ， 你 们 要 我 释 放 哪 一 个 给 你 们 呢 ？ 他 们 说 ， 巴 拉 巴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas. \\n\\n [bbe] But the ruler made answer and said to them, Which of the two is it your pleasure that I let go free? And they said, Barabbas. \\n\\n 27:22 [hgb] 彼 拉 多 说 ， 这 样 ， 那 称 为 基 督 的 耶 稣 ， 我 怎 么 办 他 呢 ？ 他 们 都 说 ， 把 他 钉 十 字 架 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified. \\n\\n [bbe] Pilate says to them, What, then, am I to do with Jesus, who is named Christ? They all say, Let him be put to death on the cross. \\n\\n 27:23 [hgb] 巡 抚 说 ， 为 什 么 呢 ？ 他 作 了 什 么 恶 事 呢 ？ 他 们 便 极 力 地 喊 着 说 ， 把 他 钉 十 字 架 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they gave loud cries, saying, To the cross with him! \\n\\n 27:24 [hgb] 彼 拉 多 见 说 也 无 济 于 事 ， 反 要 生 乱 ， 就 拿 水 在 众 人 面 前 洗 手 ， 说 ， 流 这 义 人 的 血 ， 罪 不 在 我 ， 你 们 承 当 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it. \\n\\n [bbe] So when Pilate saw that he was able to do nothing, but that trouble was working up, he took water and, washing his hands before the people, said, The blood of this upright man is not on my hands: you are responsible. \\n\\n 27:25 [hgb] 众 人 都 回 答 说 ， 他 的 血 归 到 我 们 ， 和 我 们 的 子 孙 身 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children. \\n\\n [bbe] And all the people made answer and said, Let his blood be on us, and on our children. \\n\\n 27:26 [hgb] 于 是 彼 拉 多 释 放 巴 拉 巴 给 他 们 ， 把 耶 稣 鞭 打 了 ， 交 给 人 钉 十 字 架 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he let Barabbas go free: but after having Jesus whipped, he gave him up to be put to death on the cross. \\n\\n 27:27 [hgb] 巡 抚 的 兵 就 把 耶 稣 带 进 衙 门 ， 叫 全 营 的 兵 都 聚 集 在 他 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the ruler\u0027s armed men took Jesus into the open square, and got all their band together. \\n\\n 27:28 [hgb] 他 们 给 他 脱 了 衣 服 ， 穿 上 一 件 朱 红 色 袍 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. \\n\\n [bbe] And they took off his clothing, and put on him a red robe. \\n\\n 27:29 [hgb] 用 荆 棘 编 作 冠 冕 ， 戴 在 他 头 上 ， 拿 一 根 苇 子 放 在 他 右 手 里 。 跪 在 他 面 前 戏 弄 他 说 ， 恭 喜 犹 太 人 的 王 阿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! \\n\\n [bbe] And they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and put a rod in his right hand, and they went down on their knees before him, and made sport of him, saying, Long life to the King of the Jews. \\n\\n 27:30 [hgb] 又 吐 唾 沫 在 他 脸 上 ， 拿 苇 子 打 他 的 头 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head. \\n\\n [bbe] And they put shame on him, and gave him blows on the head with the rod. \\n\\n 27:31 [hgb] 戏 弄 完 了 ， 就 给 他 脱 了 袍 子 ， 仍 穿 上 他 自 己 的 衣 服 ， 带 他 出 去 ， 要 钉 十 字 架 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him. \\n\\n [bbe] And when they had made sport of him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothing on him, and took him away to put him on the cross. \\n\\n 27:32 [hgb] 他 们 出 来 的 时 候 ， 遇 见 一 个 古 利 奈 人 ， 名 叫 西 门 ， 就 勉 强 他 同 去 ， 好 背 着 耶 稣 的 十 字 架 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross. \\n\\n [bbe] And while they were coming out, they saw a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they made him go with them, so that he might take up his cross. \\n\\n 27:33 [hgb] 到 了 一 个 地 方 ， 名 叫 各 各 他 ， 意 思 就 是 髑 髅 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull, \\n\\n [bbe] And when they came to the place named Golgotha, that is to say, Dead Man\u0027s Head, \\n\\n 27:34 [hgb] 兵 丁 拿 苦 胆 调 和 的 酒 ， 给 耶 稣 喝 。 他 尝 了 ， 就 不 肯 喝 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink. \\n\\n [bbe] They gave him wine mixed with bitter drink: and after tasting it, he took no more. \\n\\n 27:35 [hgb] 他 们 既 将 他 钉 在 十 字 架 上 ， 就 拈 阄 分 他 的 衣 服 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. \\n\\n [bbe] And when they had put him on the cross, they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance. \\n\\n 27:36 [hgb] 又 坐 在 那 里 看 守 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And sitting down they watched him there; \\n\\n [bbe] And they were seated there watching him. \\n\\n 27:37 [hgb] 在 他 头 以 上 ， 安 一 个 牌 子 ， 写 着 他 的 罪 状 ， 说 ， 这 是 犹 太 人 的 王 耶 稣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. \\n\\n [bbe] And they put up over his head the statement of his crime in writing, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. \\n\\n 27:38 [hgb] 当 时 ， 有 两 个 强 盗 ， 和 他 同 钉 十 字 架 ， 一 个 在 右 边 ， 一 个 在 左 边 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. \\n\\n [bbe] Then two thieves were put on crosses with him, one on the right and one on the left. \\n\\n 27:39 [hgb] 从 那 里 经 过 的 人 ， 讥 诮 他 ， 摇 着 头 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, \\n\\n [bbe] And those who went by said bitter words to him, shaking their heads and saying, \\n\\n 27:40 [hgb] 你 这 拆 毁 圣 殿 ， 三 日 又 建 造 起 来 的 ， 可 以 救 自 己 吧 。 你 如 果 是 神 的 儿 子 ， 就 从 十 字 架 上 下 来 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. \\n\\n [bbe] You who would give the Temple to destruction and put it up again in three days, get yourself free: if you are the Son of God, come down from the cross. \\n\\n 27:41 [hgb] 祭 司 长 和 文 士 并 长 老 ， 也 是 这 样 戏 弄 他 ， 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, \\n\\n [bbe] In the same way, the chief priests, making sport of him, with the scribes and those in authority, said, \\n\\n 27:42 [hgb] 他 救 了 别 人 ， 不 能 救 自 己 。 他 是 以 色 列 的 王 ， 现 在 可 以 从 十 字 架 上 下 来 ， 我 们 就 信 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him. \\n\\n [bbe] A saviour of others, he has no salvation for himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will have faith in him. \\n\\n 27:43 [hgb] 他 倚 靠 神 ， 神 若 喜 悦 他 ， 现 在 可 以 救 他 。 因 为 他 曾 说 ， 我 是 神 的 儿 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. \\n\\n [bbe] He put his faith in God; let God be his saviour now, if he will have him; for he said, I am the Son of God. \\n\\n 27:44 [hgb] 那 和 他 同 钉 的 强 盗 ， 也 是 这 样 的 讥 诮 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth. \\n\\n [bbe] And the thieves who were on the crosses said evil words to him. \\n\\n 27:45 [hgb] 从 午 正 到 申 初 ， 遍 地 都 黑 暗 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour. \\n\\n [bbe] Now from the sixth hour it was dark over all the land till the ninth hour. \\n\\n 27:46 [hgb] 约 在 申 初 ， 耶 稣 大 声 喊 着 说 ， 以 利 ， 以 利 ， 拉 马 撒 巴 各 大 尼 ？ 就 是 说 ， 我 的 神 ， 我 的 神 ， 为 什 么 离 弃 我 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? \\n\\n [bbe] And about the ninth hour Jesus gave a loud cry, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why are you turned away from me? \\n\\n 27:47 [hgb] 站 在 那 里 的 人 ， 有 的 听 见 就 说 ， 这 个 人 呼 叫 以 利 亚 呢 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. \\n\\n [bbe] And some of those who were near by, hearing it, said, This man is crying to Elijah. \\n\\n 27:48 [hgb] 内 中 有 一 个 人 ， 赶 紧 跑 去 ， 拿 海 绒 蘸 满 了 醋 ， 绑 在 苇 子 上 ， 送 给 他 喝 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink. \\n\\n [bbe] And straight away one of them went quickly, and took a sponge, and made it full of bitter wine, and put it on a rod and gave him drink. \\n\\n 27:49 [hgb] 其 余 的 人 说 ， 且 等 着 ， 看 以 利 亚 来 救 他 不 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him. \\n\\n [bbe] And the rest said, Let him be; let us see if Elijah will come to his help. \\n\\n 27:50 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 大 声 喊 叫 ， 气 就 断 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus gave another loud cry, and gave up his spirit. \\n\\n 27:51 [hgb] 忽 然 殿 里 的 幔 子 ， 从 上 到 下 裂 为 两 半 。 地 也 震 动 。 磐 石 也 崩 裂 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; \\n\\n [bbe] And the curtain of the Temple was parted in two from end to end; and there was an earth-shock; and the rocks were broken; \\n\\n 27:52 [hgb] 坟 墓 也 开 了 。 已 睡 圣 徒 的 身 体 ， 多 有 起 来 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, \\n\\n [bbe] And the resting-places of the dead came open; and the bodies of a number of sleeping saints came to life; \\n\\n 27:53 [hgb] 到 耶 稣 复 活 以 后 ， 他 们 从 坟 墓 里 出 来 ， 进 了 圣 城 ， 向 许 多 人 显 现 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. \\n\\n [bbe] And coming out of their resting-places, after he had come again from the dead, they went into the holy town and were seen by a number of people. \\n\\n 27:54 [hgb] 百 夫 长 和 一 同 看 守 耶 稣 的 人 ， 看 见 地 震 ， 并 所 经 历 的 事 ， 就 极 其 害 怕 ， 说 ， 这 真 是 神 的 儿 子 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the captain and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earth-shock and the things which were done, were in great fear and said, Truly this was a son of God. \\n\\n 27:55 [hgb] 有 好 些 妇 女 在 那 里 远 远 地 观 看 。 她 们 是 从 加 利 利 跟 随 耶 稣 来 服 事 他 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: \\n\\n [bbe] And a number of women were there, watching from a distance, who had come with Jesus from Galilee, waiting on his needs. \\n\\n 27:56 [hgb] 内 中 有 抹 大 拉 的 马 利 亚 ， 又 有 雅 各 和 约 西 的 母 亲 马 利 亚 ， 并 有 西 庇 太 两 个 儿 子 的 母 亲 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee\u0027s children. \\n\\n [bbe] Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. \\n\\n 27:57 [hgb] 到 了 晚 上 ， 有 一 个 财 主 ， 名 叫 约 瑟 ， 是 亚 利 马 太 来 的 。 他 也 是 耶 稣 的 门 徒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus\u0027 disciple: \\n\\n [bbe] And in the evening, there came a man of wealth from Arimathaea, Joseph by name, who was a disciple of Jesus: \\n\\n 27:58 [hgb] 这 人 去 见 彼 拉 多 ， 求 耶 稣 的 身 体 。 彼 拉 多 就 吩 咐 给 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered. \\n\\n [bbe] This man went in to Pilate, and made a request for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate gave orders for it to be given to him. \\n\\n 27:59 [hgb] 约 瑟 取 了 身 体 ， 用 干 净 细 麻 布 裹 好 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, \\n\\n [bbe] And Joseph took the body, folding it in clean linen, \\n\\n 27:60 [hgb] 安 放 在 自 己 的 新 坟 墓 里 ， 就 是 他 凿 在 磐 石 里 的 。 他 又 把 大 石 头 滚 到 墓 门 口 ， 就 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed. \\n\\n [bbe] And put it in the resting-place which had been cut out of the rock for himself; and after rolling a great stone to the door of it he went away. \\n\\n 27:61 [hgb] 有 抹 大 拉 的 马 利 亚 ， 和 那 个 马 利 亚 在 那 里 ， 对 着 坟 墓 坐 着 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. \\n\\n [bbe] And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, seated by the place of the dead. \\n\\n 27:62 [hgb] 次 日 ， 就 是 预 备 日 的 第 二 天 ， 祭 司 长 和 法 利 赛 人 聚 集 ， 来 见 彼 拉 多 ， 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, \\n\\n [bbe] Now on the day after the getting ready of the Passover, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate, \\n\\n 27:63 [hgb] 大 人 ， 我 们 记 得 那 诱 惑 人 的 ， 还 活 着 的 时 候 ， 曾 说 ， 三 日 后 我 要 复 活 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. \\n\\n [bbe] Saying, Sir, we have in mind how that false man said, while he was still living, After three days I will come again from the dead. \\n\\n 27:64 [hgb] 因 此 ， 请 吩 咐 人 将 坟 墓 把 守 妥 当 ， 直 到 第 三 日 。 恐 怕 他 的 门 徒 来 把 他 偷 了 去 ， 就 告 诉 百 姓 说 ， 他 从 死 里 复 活 了 。 这 样 ， 那 后 来 的 迷 惑 ， 比 先 前 的 更 利 害 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first. \\n\\n [bbe] Give orders, then, that the place where his body is may be made safe till the third day, for fear that his disciples come and take him away secretly and say to the people, He has come back from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first. \\n\\n 27:65 [hgb] 彼 拉 多 说 ， 你 们 有 看 守 的 兵 。 去 吧 ， 尽 你 们 所 能 的 ， 把 守 妥 当 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. \\n\\n [bbe] Pilate said to them, You have watchmen; go and make it as safe as you are able. \\n\\n 27:66 [hgb] 他 们 就 带 着 看 守 的 兵 同 去 ， 封 了 石 头 ， 将 坟 墓 把 守 妥 当 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch. \\n\\n [bbe] So they went, and made safe the place where his body was, putting a stamp on the stone, and the watchmen were with them. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2122.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
