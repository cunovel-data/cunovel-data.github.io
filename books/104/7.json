\\n\\n [bbe] And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brother\u0027s eye, but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye? \\n\\n 7:4 [hgb] 你 自 己 眼 中 有 梁 木 ， 怎 能 对 你 弟 兄 说 ， 容 我 去 掉 你 眼 中 的 刺 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? \\n\\n [bbe] Or how will you say to your brother, Let me take out the grain of dust from your eye, when you yourself have a bit of wood in your eye? \\n\\n 7:5 [hgb] 你 这 假 冒 为 善 的 人 ， 先 去 掉 自 己 眼 中 的 梁 木 ， 然 后 才 能 看 得 清 楚 ， 去 掉 你 弟 兄 眼 中 的 刺 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother\u0027s eye. \\n\\n [bbe] You false one, first take out the bit of wood from your eye, then will you see clearly to take out the grain of dust from your brother\u0027s eye. \\n\\n 7:6 [hgb] 不 要 把 圣 物 给 狗 ， 也 不 要 把 你 们 的 珍 珠 丢 在 猪 前 ， 恐 怕 它 践 踏 了 珍 珠 ， 转 过 来 咬 你 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. \\n\\n [bbe] Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, or put your jewels before pigs, for fear that they will be crushed under foot by the pigs whose attack will then be made against you. \\n\\n 7:7 [hgb] 你 们 祈 求 ， 就 给 你 们 。 寻 找 ， 就 寻 见 。 叩 门 ， 就 给 你 们 开 门 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: \\n\\n [bbe] Make a request, and it will be answered; what you are searching for you will get; give the sign, and the door will be open to you: \\n\\n 7:8 [hgb] 因 为 凡 祈 求 的 ， 就 得 着 。 寻 找 的 ， 就 寻 见 。 叩 门 的 ， 就 给 他 开 门 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. \\n\\n [bbe] Because to everyone who makes a request, it will be given; and he who is searching will get his desire, and to him who gives the sign, the door will be open. \\n\\n 7:9 [hgb] 你 们 中 间 ， 谁 有 儿 子 求 饼 ， 反 给 他 石 头 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? \\n\\n [bbe] Or which of you, if his son makes a request for bread, will give him a stone? \\n\\n 7:10 [hgb] 求 鱼 ， 反 给 他 蛇 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent? \\n\\n [bbe] Or if he makes a request for a fish, will give him a snake? \\n\\n 7:11 [hgb] 你 们 虽 然 不 好 ， 尚 且 知 道 拿 好 东 西 给 儿 女 ， 何 况 你 们 在 天 上 的 父 ， 岂 不 更 把 好 东 西 给 求 他 的 人 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? \\n\\n [bbe] If you, then, being evil, are able to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who make requests to him? \\n\\n 7:12 [hgb] 所 以 无 论 何 事 ， 你 们 愿 意 人 怎 样 待 你 们 ， 你 们 也 要 怎 样 待 人 。 因 为 这 就 是 律 法 和 先 知 的 道 理 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. \\n\\n [bbe] All those things, then, which you would have men do to you, even so do you to them: because this is the law and the prophets. \\n\\n 7:13 [hgb] 你 们 要 进 窄 门 。 因 为 引 到 灭 亡 ， 那 门 是 宽 的 ， 路 是 大 的 ， 进 去 的 人 也 多 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: \\n\\n [bbe] Go in by the narrow door; for wide is the door and open is the way which goes to destruction, and great numbers go in by it. \\n\\n 7:14 [hgb] 引 到 永 生 ， 那 门 是 窄 的 ， 路 是 小 的 ， 找 着 的 人 也 少 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. \\n\\n [bbe] For narrow is the door and hard the road to life, and only a small number make discovery of it. \\n\\n 7:15 [hgb] 你 们 要 防 备 假 先 知 。 他 们 到 你 们 这 里 来 ， 外 面 披 着 羊 皮 ， 里 面 却 是 残 暴 的 狼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep\u0027s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. \\n\\n [bbe] Be on the watch for false prophets, who come to you in sheep\u0027s clothing, but inside they are cruel wolves. \\n\\n 7:16 [hgb] 凭 着 他 们 的 果 子 ， 就 可 以 认 出 他 们 来 。 荆 棘 上 岂 能 摘 葡 萄 呢 ？ 蒺 藜 里 岂 能 摘 无 花 果 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? \\n\\n [bbe] By their fruits you will get knowledge of them. Do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? \\n\\n 7:17 [hgb] 这 样 ， 凡 好 树 都 结 好 果 子 ， 惟 独 坏 树 结 坏 果 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. \\n\\n [bbe] Even so, every good tree gives good fruit; but the bad tree gives evil fruit. \\n\\n 7:18 [hgb] 好 树 不 能 结 坏 果 子 ， 坏 树 不 能 结 好 果 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. \\n\\n [bbe] It is not possible for a good tree to give bad fruit, and a bad tree will not give good fruit. \\n\\n 7:19 [hgb] 凡 不 结 好 果 子 的 树 ， 就 砍 下 来 ， 丢 在 火 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. \\n\\n [bbe] Every tree which does not give good fruit is cut down and put in the fire. \\n\\n 7:20 [hgb] 所 以 凭 着 他 们 的 果 子 ， 就 可 以 认 出 他 们 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. \\n\\n [bbe] So by their fruits you will get knowledge of them. \\n\\n 7:21 [hgb] 凡 称 呼 我 主 阿 ， 主 阿 的 人 ， 不 能 都 进 天 国 。 惟 独 遵 行 我 天 父 旨 意 的 人 ， 才 能 进 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. \\n\\n [bbe] Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will go into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the pleasure of my Father in heaven. \\n\\n 7:22 [hgb] 当 那 日 必 有 许 多 人 对 我 说 ， 主 阿 ， 主 阿 ， 我 们 不 是 奉 你 的 名 传 道 ， 奉 你 的 名 赶 鬼 ， 奉 你 的 名 行 许 多 异 能 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? \\n\\n [bbe] A great number will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, were we not prophets in your name, and did we not by your name send out evil spirits, and by your name do works of power? \\n\\n 7:23 [hgb] 我 就 明 明 地 告 诉 他 们 说 ， 我 从 来 不 认 识 你 们 ， 你 们 这 些 作 恶 的 人 ， 离 开 我 去 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. \\n\\n [bbe] And then will I say to them, I never had knowledge of you: go from me, you workers of evil. \\n\\n 7:24 [hgb] 所 以 凡 听 见 我 这 话 就 去 行 的 ， 好 比 一 个 聪 明 人 ， 把 房 子 盖 在 磐 石 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: \\n\\n [bbe] Everyone, then, to whom my words come and who does them, will be like a wise man who made his house on a rock; \\n\\n 7:25 [hgb] 雨 淋 ， 水 冲 ， 风 吹 ， 撞 着 那 房 子 ， 房 子 总 不 倒 塌 。 因 为 根 基 立 在 磐 石 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. \\n\\n [bbe] And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house, but it was not moved; because it was based on the rock. \\n\\n 7:26 [hgb] 凡 听 见 我 这 话 不 去 行 的 ， 好 比 一 个 无 知 的 人 ， 把 房 子 盖 在 沙 土 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: \\n\\n [bbe] And everyone to whom my words come and who does them not, will be like a foolish man who made his house on sand; \\n\\n 7:27 [hgb] 雨 淋 ， 水 冲 ， 风 吹 ， 撞 着 那 房 子 ， 房 子 就 倒 塌 了 。 并 且 倒 塌 得 很 大 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. \\n\\n [bbe] And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house; and it came down and great was its fall. \\n\\n 7:28 [hgb] 耶 稣 讲 完 了 这 些 话 ， 众 人 都 希 奇 他 的 教 训 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: \\n\\n [bbe] And it came about, when Jesus had come to the end of these words, that the people were surprised at his teaching, \\n\\n 7:29 [hgb] 因 为 他 教 训 他 们 ， 正 像 有 权 柄 的 人 ， 不 像 他 们 的 文 士 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes. \\n\\n [bbe] for he was teaching as one having authority, and not as their scribes. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153/2102.html","bookId":104,"book":{"id":104,"title":"马太福音 Matthew","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 大 卫 的 子 孙 ， 耶 稣 基 督 的 家 谱 。 （ 后 裔 子 孙 原 文 都 作 儿 子 下 同 ） [kjv] The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/153","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
