{"id":108728,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The hall outside Cal\u0027s door duplicated all the features of the one on Franz\u0027s floor: black-painted airshaft window, knobless door to disused broom closet, drab golden elevator door, and low-set, snap-capped vacuum outlet - a relic of the days when the motor for a building\u0027s vacuum system was in the basement and the maid handled only a long hose and brush. But before Franz, starting down the hall, had passed any of these, he heard from ahead an intimate, giggly laugh that made him remember the one he\u0027d imagined for the imaginary maids. Then some words he couldn\u0027t catch in a man\u0027s voice: low, rapid, and jocular. Saul\u0027s? - it did seem to come from above. Then the feminine or girlish laughter again, louder and a little explosive, almost as if someone were being tickled. Then a rush of light footsteps coming down the stairs. He reached them just in time to get a glimpse, down and across the stairwell, of a shadowy slender figure disappearing around the last visible angle - just the suggestion of black hair and clothing and slim white wrists and ankles, all in swift movement. He moved to the well and looked down it, struck by how the successive floors below were like the series of reflections you saw when you stood between two mirrors. The rapid footsteps continued their spiraling descent all the way down, but whoever was making them was keeping to the wall and away from the rail lining the well, as if driven by centrifugal force, so he got no further glimpses. As he peered down that long, narrow tube dimly lit from the skylight above, still thinking of the black-clad limbs and the laughter, a murky memory rose in his mind and for a few moments possessed him utterly. Although it refused to come wholly clear, it gripped him with the authority of a very unpleasant dream or bad drunk. He was standing upright in a dark, claustrophobically narrow, crowded, musty space. Through the fabric of his trousers he felt a small hand laid on his genitals and he heard a low, wicked laugh. He looked down in his memory and saw the foreshortened, ghostly, featureless oval of a small face and the laugh was repeated, mockingly. Somehow it seemed there were black tendrils all around him. He felt a weight of sick excitement and guilt and, almost, fear. The murky memory lifted as Franz realized the figure on the stairs had to have been that of Bonita Luque wearing the black pajamas and robe and feathered black mules she\u0027d been handed down from her mother and already outgrown, but sometimes still wore as she darted around the building on her mother\u0027s early-morning errands. He smiled disparagingly at the thought that he was almost sorry (not really!) he was no longer drunk and so able to nurse various kinky excitements. He started up the stairs, but stopped almost at once when he heard Gun\u0027s and Saul\u0027s voices from the floor above. He did not want to see either of them now, at first simply from a reluctance to share today\u0027s mood and plans with anyone but Cal, but as he listened to the clear and sharpening voices his motive became more complicated. Gun asked, \"What was that all about?\" Saul answered, \"Her mother sent the kid up to check if either of us had lost a cassette player-recorder. She thinks her kleptomaniac on the second floor has one that doesn\u0027t belong to her.\" Gun remarked, \"That\u0027s a big word for Mrs. Luque.\" Saul said, \"Oh, I suppose she said \u0027e-stealer.\u0027 I told the kid that no, I still had mine.\" Gun asked, \"Why didn\u0027t Bonita check with me?\" Saul answered, \"Because I told her you didn\u0027t have a cassette player to start with. What\u0027s the matter? Feeling left out?\" \"No!\" During this interchange Gun\u0027s voice had grown increasingly nagging, Saul\u0027s progressively cooler yet also teasing. Franz had listened to mild speculation about the degree of homosexuality in Gun\u0027s and Saul\u0027s friendship, but this was the first time he found himself really wondering about it. No, he definitely didn\u0027t want to barge in now. Saul persisted, \"Then what\u0027s the matter? Hell, Gun, you know I always horse around with Bonny.\" Gun\u0027s voice as almost waspish as he said, \"I know I\u0027m a puritanized North European, but I\u0027d like to know just how far liberation from Anglo-Saxon body-contact taboos is supposed to go.\" And Saul\u0027s voice was almost taunting as he replied, \"Why, just as far as you both think proper, I suppose.\" There was the sound of a door closing very deliberately. It was repeated. Then silence. Franz breathed his relief, continued softly up - and as he emerged into the fifth-floor hall found himself almost face to face with Gun, who was standing in front of the shut door to his room, glaring across at Saul\u0027s. Set on the floor beside him was a knee-high rectangular object with a chrome carrying handle protruding from its gray fabric cover. Gunnar Nordgren was a tall, slim man, ashen blond, a fined-down Viking. Right now he had shifted his gaze and was looking at Franz with a growing embarrassment that matched Franz\u0027s own feelings. Abruptly Gun\u0027s usual amiability flooded back into his face, and he said, \"Say, I\u0027m glad you came by. A couple of nights ago you were wondering about document-shredding machines. Here\u0027s one I had here from the office overnight.\" He whipped off the cover, revealing a tall blue and silvery box with a foot-wide maw on top and a red button. The maw fed down into a deep basket which Franz, coming closer, could see was one-quarter filled with a dirty snow of paper diamonds less than a quarter inch across. The uncomfortable feelings of a moment before were gone. Looking up, Franz said, \"I know you\u0027re going to work and all, but could I hear it in operation once?\" \"Of course.\" Gun unlocked the door behind him and led Franz into a neat, rather sparely furnished room, the first features of which to strike the eye were large astronomical photographs in color and skiing equipment. As Gun unrolled the electric cord and plugged it in, he said lightheartedly, \"This is a Shredbasket put out by Destroysit. Properly dire names, eh? Costs only five hundred dollars or so. Larger models go up to two thousand. A set of circular knives cuts the paper to ribbons; then another set cuts the ribbons across. Believe it or not, these machines were developed from ones for making confetti. I like that - it suggests that mankind first thinks of making frivolous things and only later puts them to serious use - if you can call this serious. Games before guilt.\" The words poured out of him in such an excess of excitement or relief that Franz forgot his wonder as to why Gun should have brought such a machine home - what he\u0027d been destroying. Gun continued, \"The ingenious Italians - what was it Shakespeare said? Supersubtle Venetians? - lead the world, you know, in inventing machines for food and fun. Ice-cream makers, pasta extruders, espresso coffee machines, set-piece fireworks, hurdy-gurdies... and confetti. Well, here goes.\" Franz had taken out a small notebook and ballpoint pen. As Gun\u0027s finger moved toward the red button, he leaned close, rather cautiously, expecting some rather loud sound. Instead, there came a faint, breathy buzzing, as if Time were clearing her throat. Delightedly Franz jotted down just that. Gun fed in a pastel sheet. Pale blue snow showered down upon the dirty white. The sound barely thickened a little. Franz thanked Gun and left him coiling up the cord. Mounting past his own floor and the seventh toward the roof, he felt pleased. Getting that scrap of observed fact had been just the bit of luck he\u0027d needed to start the day perfectly.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/our-lady-of-darkness/page-4.html","bookId":2519,"book":{"id":2519,"title":"Our Lady of Darkness","description":"Storyline: Middle-aged San Francisco horror writer Franz Westen is rediscovering ordinary life following a long alcoholic binge.
