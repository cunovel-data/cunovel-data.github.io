Almost all my information comes from a couple of the not-so-close and hardly well-beloved friends of de Castries\u0027s last declining years: George Ricker, who was a locksmith and played go with him, and Herman Klaas, who ran a secondhand bookstore on Turk Street and was a sort of romantic anarchist and for a while a Technocrat. And a bit from Clark Ashton Smith. Ah, that interests you, doesn\u0027t it? It was only a bit - Clark didn\u0027t like to talk about de Castries. I think it was because of de Castries and his theories that Clark stayed away from big cities, even San Francisco, and became the hermit of Auburn and Pacific Grove. And I\u0027ve got some data from old letters and clippings, but not much. People didn\u0027t like to write down things about de Castries, and they had reasons, and in the end the man himself made secrecy a way of life. Which is odd, considering that he began his chief career by writing and publishing a sensational book. Incidentally, I got my copy from Klaas when he died, and he may have found it among de Castries\u0027s things after de Castries died - I was never sure.\n \"Also,\" Donaldus continued, \"I\u0027ll probably tell the story - at least in spots - in a somewhat poetic style. Don\u0027t let that put you off. It merely helps me organize my thoughts and select the significant items. I won\u0027t be straying in the least from the strict truth as I\u0027ve discovered it; though there may be traces of paramentals in my story, I suppose, and certainly one ghost. I think all modern cities, especially the crass, newly built, highly industrial ones, should have ghosts. They are a civilizing influence.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/our-lady-of-darkness/page-18.html","bookId":2519,"book":{"id":2519,"title":"Our Lady of Darkness","description":"Storyline: \n Middle-aged San Francisco horror writer Franz Westen is rediscovering ordinary life following a long alcoholic binge.
