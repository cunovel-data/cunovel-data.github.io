{"id":108737,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"In the doorway Cal looked so sweet and young in a green dress, her hair in a long pony tail, that he wanted to grab and kiss her. But she also still had on her rapt, meditative look - \"Keep intact for Bach.\"\\n\\n She said, \"Hello, dear. I actually slept those twelve hours I threatened to in my pride. God is merciful. Do you mind eggs again? It\u0027s really brunchtime. Pour yourself coffee.\"\\n\\n \"Any more practice today?\" he asked, glancing toward the electronic keyboard.\\n\\n \"Yes, but not with that. This afternoon I\u0027ll have three or four hours with the concert harpsichord. And I\u0027ll be tuning it.\"\\n\\n He drank creamed coffee and watched the poetry of motion as she dreamily broke eggs, an unconscious ballet of white ovoids and slender key-flattened fingertips. He found himself comparing her to Daisy, and, to his amusement, to his Scholar\u0027s Mistress. Cal and the latter were both slender, somewhat intellectual, rather silent types, touched with the White Goddess definitely, dreamy but disciplined. Daisy had been touched with the White Goddess too, a poet, and also disciplined, keeping herself intact... for brain cancer. He veered off from that.\\n\\n But White was certainly Cal\u0027s adjective; all right, no Lady of Darkness, but a Lady of Light and in eternal opposition to the other, yang to its yin, Ormadz to its Ahriman - yes, by Robert Ingersoll!\\n\\n And she really did look such a schoolgirl, her face a mask of gay innocence and good behavior. But then he remembered her as she had launched into the first piece of a concert. He\u0027d been sitting up close and a little to one side so that he had seen her full profile. As if by some swift magic, she had become someone he\u0027d never seen before and wasn\u0027t sure for a moment he wanted to. Her chin had tucked down into her neck, her nostril had flared, her eye had become all-seeing and merciless, her lips had pressed together and turned down at the corners quite nastily, like a savage schoolmistress, and it had been as if she had been saying, \"Now hear me, all your strings and Mister Chopin. You behave perfectly now, or else!\" It had been the look of the young professional.\\n\\n \"Eat them while they\u0027re hot,\" Cal murmured, slipping his plate in front of him. \"Here\u0027s the toast. Buttered, somehow.\"\\n\\n After a while she asked, \"How did you sleep?\"\\n\\n He told her about the stars.\\n\\n She said, \"I\u0027m glad you worship.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s true in a way,\" he had to admit. \"Saint Copernicus, at any rate, and Isaac Newton.\"\\n\\n \"My father used to swear by them, too,\" she told him. \"Even, I remember once, by Einstein. I started to do it myself too, but Mother gently discouraged me. She thought it tomboyish.\"\\n\\n Franz smiled. He didn\u0027t bring up this morning\u0027s reading or yesterday\u0027s events; they seemed wrong topics for now.\\n\\n It was she who said, \"I thought Saul was quite cute last night. I like the way he flirts with Dorotea.\"\\n\\n \"He loves to pretend to shock her,\" Franz said.\\n\\n \"And she loves to pretend to be shocked,\" Cal agreed. \"I think I\u0027ll give her a fan for Christmas, just to have the delight of watching her manage it. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d trust him with Bonita, though.\"\\n\\n \"What, our Saul?\" he asked, in only half-pretended astonishment. The memory came, vividly and uncomfortably, of laughter overheard on the stairs yesterday morning, a laughter alive with touching and tickling.\\n\\n \"People have unexpected sides,\" she observed placidly. \"You\u0027re very brisk and brimming with energy this morning. Almost bumptious, except you\u0027re being considerate for my mood. But underneath you\u0027re thoughtful. What are your plans for today?\"\\n\\n He told her.\\n\\n \"That sounds good,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve heard Byers\u0027s place is quite spooky. Or maybe they meant exotic. And I\u0027d really like to find out about 607 Rhodes. You know - peer over the shoulder of \u0027stout Cortez\u0027 and see it there, whatever it is, \u0027silent upon a peak in Darien.\u0027 And just find out the history of this building, like Gun was wondering. That would be fascinating. Well, I should be getting ready.\"\\n\\n \"Will I see you before? Take you there?\" he asked as he got up.\\n\\n \"No, not before, I think,\" she said thoughtfully. \"But afterward.\" She smiled at him. \"I\u0027m relieved to hear you\u0027ll be there. Take care, Franz.\"\\n\\n \"You take care too, Cal,\" he told her.\\n\\n \"On concert days I wrap myself in wool. No, wait.\"\\n\\n She came toward him, head lifted, continuing to smile. He got his arms around her before they kissed. Her lips were soft and cool. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/our-lady-of-darkness/page-13.html","bookId":2519,"book":{"id":2519,"title":"Our Lady of Darkness","description":"Storyline: Middle-aged San Francisco horror writer Franz Westen is rediscovering ordinary life following a long alcoholic binge.
