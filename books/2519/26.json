{"id":108750,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"Half of a toothy mouth and large brown eye were grinning up at him across the chain and a voice saying, \"E-chess?\"\n Franz quickly unhooked the chain and opened the door eagerly. He was vastly relieved to have a familiar person with him, sharply disappointed that it was someone with whom he could hardly communicate at all - certainly not the stuff crowding his mind - yet consoled by the thought that at least they shared the language of chess. Chess would at least pass some time, he hoped.\n Fernando came in beaming, though frowning questioningly a moment at the chain, and then again at Franz when he quickly reclosed and double-locked the door.\n In answer, Franz offered him a drink. Fernando\u0027s black eyebrows went up at sight of the square bottle, and he smiled wider and nodded, but when Franz had opened the bottle and poured him a small wineglass, he hesitated, asking with his mobile features and expressive hands why Franz wasn\u0027t drinking.\n As the simplest solution, Franz poured himself a bit in another wineglass, hiding with his fingers how little, and tilted the glass until the aromatic liquid wet his closed lips. He offered Fernando a second drink, but the latter pointed towards the chessmen, then at his head, which he shook smilingly.\n Franz set the chessboard somewhat precariously on top of the piled folders on the coffee table, and sat down on the bed. Fernando looked somewhat dubiously at the arrangement, then shrugged and smiled, drew up a chair and sat down opposite. He got the white pawn and when they\u0027d set up the men he opened confidently.\n Franz made his moves quickly, too. He found himself almost automatically resuming the \"on guard\" routine he\u0027d employed at Beaver Street while listening to Byers. His watchful gaze would move from the end of the wall behind him to his clothes cabinet to the door, then past a small bookcase to the closet door, across the table crowded with the unopened mail and all, past the bathroom door to the larger bookcase and desk, pause at the window, then travel along his filing cabinets to the steam radiator and to the other end of the wall behind him, then start back again. He got the ghost of a bitter taste as he wet his lips - the kirschwasser.\n Fernando won in twenty moves or so. He looked thoughtfully at Franz for a couple of moments, as if about to make some point about his indifferent play, but instead smiled and began to set up the men with colors reversed.\n With deliberate recklessness Franz opened with the king\u0027s gambit. Fernando countered in the center with his queen\u0027s pawn. Despite the dangerous and chancy position, Franz found he couldn\u0027t concentrate on the game. He kept searching his mind for other precautions to take besides his visual guard. He strained his ears for sounds at the door and beyond the other partitions. He wished desperately that Fernando had more English, or weren\u0027t so deaf. The combination was simply too much.\n And the time passed so slowly. The large hand of his wristwatch was frozen. It was like one of those moments at a drunken party - when you\u0027re on the verge of blackout - that seem to last forever. At this rate it would be ages before the concert was over.\n And then it occurred to him that he had no guarantee that Cal and the others would return at once. People generally went to bars or restaurants after performances, to celebrate or talk.\n He was faintly aware of Fernando studying him between the moves.\n Of course he could go back to the concert himself when Fernando left. But that wouldn\u0027t settle anything. He\u0027d left the concert determined to solve the problem of de Castries\u0027s curse and all the strangeness that went with it. And at least he\u0027d made progress. He\u0027d already answered the literal 607 Rhodes question, but of course he\u0027d meant a lot more than that when he\u0027d spoken to Saul.\n But how could he find the answer to the whole thing anyway? Serious psychic or occult research was a matter of elaborate preparation and study, using delicate, carefully checked-out instruments, or at any rate sensitive, trained people salted by previous experience: mediums, sensitives, telepaths, clairvoyants and such - who\u0027d proved themselves with Rhine cards and what-not. What could he hope to do just by himself in one evening? What had he been thinking of when he\u0027d walked out on Cal\u0027s concert and left her that message?\n Yet somehow he had the feeling that all the psychical research experts and their massed experience wouldn\u0027t really be a bit of help to him now. Any more than the science experts would be with their incredibly refined electronic and radionic detectors and photography and what-not. That amid all the fields of the occult and fringe-occult that were flourishing today - witchcraft, astrology, biofeedback, dowsing, psychokinesis, auras, acupuncture, exploratory LSD trips, loops in the time stream, astrology (much of them surely fake, some of them maybe real) - this that was happening to him was altogether different.\n He pictured himself going back to the concert, and he didn\u0027t like the picture. Very faintly, he seemed to hear the swift, glittery music of a harpsichord, still luring and lashing him on imperiously.\n Fernando cleared his throat. Franz realized he\u0027d overlooked a mate in three moves and had lost the second game in as few moves as the first. He automatically started to set up the pieces for a third.\n Fernando\u0027s hand, palm down in an emphatic no, prevented him. Franz looked up.\n Fernando was looking intently at him. The Peruvian frowned and shook a finger at Franz, indicating he was concerned about him. Then he pointed at the chessboard, then at his own head, touching his temple. Then he shook his head decisively, frowning and pointing toward Franz again.\n Franz got the message: \"Your mind is not on the game.\" He nodded.\n Fernando stood up, pushing his chair out of the way, and pantomimed a man afraid of something that was after him. Crouching a little, he kept looking around, much as Franz had been doing, but more obviously. He kept turning and looking suddenly behind him, now in one direction, now the other, his face big-eyed and fearful.\n Franz nodded that he got it.\n Fernando moved around the room, darting quick glances at the hall door and the window. While looking in another direction he rapped loudly on the radiator with his clenched fist, then instantly gave a great start and backed off from it.\n A man very afraid of something, startled by sudden noises, that must mean. Franz nodded again.\n Fernando did the same thing with the bathroom door and with the nearby wall. After rapping on the latter he stared at Franz and said, \"Hay hechiceria. Hechiceria ocultado en murallas.\"\n What had Cal said that meant? \"Witchcraft, witchcraft hidden in walls.\" Franz recalled his own wonderings about secret doors and chutes and passageways. But did Fernando mean it literally or figuratively? Franz nodded, but pursed his lips and otherwise tried to put on a questioning look.\n Fernando appeared to notice the chalked stars for the first time. White on pale woodwork, they weren\u0027t easy to see. His eyebrows went up and he smiled understandingly at Franz and nodded approvingly. He indicated the stars and then held his hands out, palms flat and away from him, at the window and doors, as if keeping something out, holding it at bay - meanwhile continuing to nod approvingly. \"Bueno,\" he said.\n Franz nodded, at the same time marveling at the fear that had led him to snatch at such an irrational protective device, one that the superstition-sodden (?) Fernando understood instantly - stars against witches. (And there had been five-pointed stars among the graffiti on Corona Heights, intended to keep dead bones at rest and ashes quiet. Byers had sprayed them there.)\n He stood up and went to the table and offered Fernando another drink, uncapping the bottle, but Fernando refused it with a short crosswise wave of his hand, palm down, and crossed to where Franz had been and rapped on the wall behind the couch and turning toward Franz repeated, \"Hechiceria ocultado en muralla!\"\n Franz looked at him questioningly. But the Peruvian only bowed his head and put three fingers to his forehead, symbolizing thought (and possibly the Peruvian was actually thinking, too).\n Then Fernando looked up with an air of revelation, took the chalk from the slate beside the chessboard, and drew on the wall a five-pointed star, larger and more conspicuous and better than any of Franz\u0027s.\n \"Bueno,\" Fernando said again, nodding. Then he pointed down behind the bed toward the baseboard it hid, repeated, \"Hay hechiceria en muralla,\" and went quickly to the hall door and pantomimed himself going away and coming back, and then looked at Franz solicitously, lifting his eyebrows, as if to ask, \"You\u0027ll be all right in the meantime?\"\n Rather bemused by the pantomime and feeling suddenly quite weary, Franz nodded with a smile and (thinking of the star Fernando had drawn and the feeling of fellowship it had given him) said, \"Gracias.\"\n Fernando nodded with a smile, unbolted the door, and went out, shutting the door behind him. A little later Franz heard the elevator stop at this floor, its doors open and close, and go droning down, as if headed for the basement of the universe. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/our-lady-of-darkness/page-26.html","bookId":2519,"book":{"id":2519,"title":"Our Lady of Darkness","description":"Storyline: \n Middle-aged San Francisco horror writer Franz Westen is rediscovering ordinary life following a long alcoholic binge.
