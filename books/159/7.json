{"id":4560,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.\n Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out--an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.\n \"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?\"\n \"Nope.\" After a pause he added \"sir\" in a dilatory, grudging way.\n \"I hadn\u0027t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.\"\n \"Who?\" he demanded rudely.\n \"Carraway.\"\n \"Carraway. All right, I\u0027ll tell him.\" Abruptly he slammed the door.\n My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren\u0027t servants at all.\n Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.\n \"Going away?\" I inquired.\n \"No, old sport.\"\n \"I hear you fired all your servants.\"\n \"I wanted somebody who wouldn\u0027t gossip. Daisy comes over quite often--in the afternoons.\"\n So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.\n \"They\u0027re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They\u0027re all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.\"\n \"I see.\"\n He was calling up at Daisy\u0027s request--would I come to lunch at her house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.\n Something was up. And yet I couldn\u0027t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene-especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.\n The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.\n \"Oh, my!\" she gasped.\n I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm\u0027s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it--but every one near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.\n \"Hot!\" said the conductor to familiar faces. \"Some weather! Hot! Hot! Hot!\n Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it...?\"\n My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.\n That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!\n ... Through the hall of the Buchanans\u0027 house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.\n \"The master\u0027s body!\" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. \"I\u0027m sorry, madame, but we can\u0027t furnish it--it\u0027s far too hot to touch this noon!\"\n What he really said was: \"Yes... yes... I\u0027ll see.\"\n He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.\n \"Madame expects you in the salon!\" he cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.\n The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\n \"We can\u0027t move,\" they said together.\n Jordan\u0027s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.\n \"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired.\n Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.\n Gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\n \"The rumor is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that that\u0027s Tom\u0027s girl on the telephone.\"\n We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.\n \"Very well, then, I won\u0027t sell you the car at all.... I\u0027m under no obligations to you at all.... And as for your bothering me about it at lunch time I won\u0027t stand that at all!\"\n \"Holding down the receiver,\" said Daisy cynically.\n \"No, he\u0027s not,\" I assured her. \"It\u0027s a bona fide deal. I happen to know about it.\"\n Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.\n \"Mr. Gatsby!\" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. \"I\u0027m glad to see you, sir.... Nick....\"\n \"Make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy.\n As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth.\n \"You know I love you,\" she murmured.\n \"You forget there\u0027s a lady present,\" said Jordan.\n Daisy looked around doubtfully.\n \"You kiss Nick too.\"\n \"What a low, vulgar girl!\"\n \"I don\u0027t care!\" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace.\n Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\n \"Bles-sed pre-cious,\" she crooned, holding out her arms. \"Come to your own mother that loves you.\"\n The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother\u0027s dress.\n \"The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do.\"\n Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.\n Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don\u0027t think he had ever really believed in its existence before.\n \"I got dressed before luncheon,\" said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.\n \"That\u0027s because your mother wanted to show you off.\" Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. \"You dream, you. You absolute little dream.\"\n \"Yes,\" admitted the child calmly. \"Aunt Jordan\u0027s got on a white dress too.\"\n \"How do you like mother\u0027s friends?\" Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. \"Do you think they\u0027re pretty?\"\n \"Where\u0027s Daddy?\"\n \"She doesn\u0027t look like her father,\" explained Daisy. \"She looks like me.\n She\u0027s got my hair and shape of the face.\"\n Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.\n \"Come, Pammy.\"\n \"Goodbye, sweetheart!\"\n With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse\u0027s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\n Gatsby took up his drink.\n \"They certainly look cool,\" he said, with visible tension.\n We drank in long greedy swallows.\n \"I read somewhere that the sun\u0027s getting hotter every year,\" said Tom genially. \"It seems that pretty soon the earth\u0027s going to fall into the sun--or wait a minute--it\u0027s just the opposite--the sun\u0027s getting colder every year.\n \"Come outside,\" he suggested to Gatsby, \"I\u0027d like you to have a look at the place.\"\n I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby\u0027s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.\n \"I\u0027m right across from you.\"\n \"So you are.\"\n Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.\n \"There\u0027s sport for you,\" said Tom, nodding. \"I\u0027d like to be out there with him for about an hour.\"\n We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.\n \"What\u0027ll we do with ourselves this afternoon,\" cried Daisy, \"and the day after that, and the next thirty years?\"\n \"Don\u0027t be morbid,\" Jordan said. \"Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.\"\n \"But it\u0027s so hot,\" insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, \"And everything\u0027s so confused. Let\u0027s all go to town!\"\n Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.\n \"I\u0027ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,\" Tom was saying to Gatsby, \"but I\u0027m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.\"\n \"Who wants to go to town?\" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby\u0027s eyes floated toward her. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"you look so cool.\"\n Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.\n With an effort she glanced down at the table.\n \"You always look so cool,\" she repeated.\n She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago.\n \"You resemble the advertisement of the man,\" she went on innocently.\n \"You know the advertisement of the man----\"\n \"All right,\" broke in Tom quickly, \"I\u0027m perfectly willing to go to town. Come on--we\u0027re all going to town.\"\n He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife.\n No one moved.\n \"Come on!\" His temper cracked a little. \"What\u0027s the matter, anyhow?\n If we\u0027re going to town let\u0027s start.\"\n His hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy\u0027s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.\n \"Are we just going to go?\" she objected. \"Like this? Aren\u0027t we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?\"\n \"Everybody smoked all through lunch.\"\n \"Oh, let\u0027s have fun,\" she begged him. \"It\u0027s too hot to fuss.\"\n He didn\u0027t answer.\n \"Have it your own way,\" she said. \"Come on, Jordan.\"\n They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.\n \"Have you got your stables here?\" asked Gatsby with an effort.\n \"About a quarter of a mile down the road.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n A pause.\n \"I don\u0027t see the idea of going to town,\" broke out Tom savagely.\n \"Women get these notions in their heads----\"\n \"Shall we take anything to drink?\" called Daisy from an upper window.\n \"I\u0027ll get some whiskey,\" answered Tom. He went inside.\n Gatsby turned to me rigidly:\n \"I can\u0027t say anything in his house, old sport.\"\n \"She\u0027s got an indiscreet voice,\" I remarked. \"It\u0027s full of----\"\n I hesitated.\n \"Her voice is full of money,\" he said suddenly.\n That was it. I\u0027d never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals\u0027 song of it.... High in a white palace the king\u0027s daughter, the golden girl....\n Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.\n \"Shall we all go in my car?\" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. \"I ought to have left it in the shade.\"\n \"Is it standard shift?\" demanded Tom.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.\"\n The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\n \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much gas,\" he objected.\n \"Plenty of gas,\" said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge.\n \"And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a drug store nowadays.\"\n A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby\u0027s face.\n \"Come on, Daisy,\" said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby\u0027s car. \"I\u0027ll take you in this circus wagon.\"\n He opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\n \"You take Nick and Jordan. We\u0027ll follow you in the coupé.\"\n She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby\u0027s car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind.\n \"Did you see that?\" demanded Tom.\n \"See what?\"\n He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along.\n \"You think I\u0027m pretty dumb, don\u0027t you?\" he suggested. \"Perhaps I am, but I have a--almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.\n Maybe you don\u0027t believe that, but science----\"\n He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss.\n \"I\u0027ve made a small investigation of this fellow,\" he continued. \"I could have gone deeper if I\u0027d known----\"\n \"Do you mean you\u0027ve been to a medium?\" inquired Jordan humorously.\n \"What?\" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. \"A medium?\"\n \"About Gatsby.\"\n \"About Gatsby! No, I haven\u0027t. I said I\u0027d been making a small investigation of his past.\"\n \"And you found he was an Oxford man,\" said Jordan helpfully.\n \"An Oxford man!\" He was incredulous. \"Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit.\"\n \"Nevertheless he\u0027s an Oxford man.\"\n \"Oxford, New Mexico,\" snorted Tom contemptuously, \"or something like that.\"\n \"Listen, Tom. If you\u0027re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?\" demanded Jordan crossly.\n \"Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married--God knows where!\"\n We were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it, we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg\u0027s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby\u0027s caution about gasoline.\n \"We\u0027ve got enough to get us to town,\" said Tom.\n \"But there\u0027s a garage right here,\" objected Jordan. \"I don\u0027t want to get stalled in this baking heat.\"\n Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson\u0027s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\n \"Let\u0027s have some gas!\" cried Tom roughly. \"What do you think we stopped for--to admire the view?\"\n \"I\u0027m sick,\" said Wilson without moving. \"I been sick all day.\"\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\n \"I\u0027m all run down.\"\n \"Well, shall I help myself?\" Tom demanded. \"You sounded well enough on the phone.\"\n With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to interrupt your lunch,\" he said. \"But I need money pretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.\"\n \"How do you like this one?\" inquired Tom. \"I bought it last week.\"\n \"It\u0027s a nice yellow one,\" said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\n \"Like to buy it?\"\n \"Big chance,\" Wilson smiled faintly. \"No, but I could make some money on the other.\"\n \"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?\"\n \"I\u0027ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go west.\"\n \"Your wife does!\" exclaimed Tom, startled.\n \"She\u0027s been talking about it for ten years.\" He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. \"And now she\u0027s going whether she wants to or not. I\u0027m going to get her away.\"\n The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.\n \"What do I owe you?\" demanded Tom harshly.\n \"I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,\" remarked Wilson. \"That\u0027s why I want to get away. That\u0027s why I been bothering you about the car.\"\n \"What do I owe you?\"\n \"Dollar twenty.\"\n The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn\u0027t alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had just got some poor girl with child.\n \"I\u0027ll let you have that car,\" said Tom. \"I\u0027ll send it over tomorrow afternoon.\"\n That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.\n In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar--it was an expression I had often seen on women\u0027s faces but on Myrtle Wilson\u0027s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.\n There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé.\n \"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,\" suggested Jordan.\n \"I love New York on summer afternoons when every one\u0027s away. There\u0027s something very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.\"\n The word \"sensuous\" had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.\n \"Where are we going?\" she cried.\n \"How about the movies?\"\n \"It\u0027s so hot,\" she complained. \"You go. We\u0027ll ride around and meet you after.\" With an effort her wit rose faintly, \"We\u0027ll meet you on some corner. I\u0027ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\"\n \"We can\u0027t argue about it here,\" Tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. \"You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.\"\n Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever.\n But they didn\u0027t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\n The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy\u0027s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as \"a place to have a mint julep.\" Each of us said over and over that it was a \"crazy idea\"--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny....\n The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o\u0027clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.\n \"It\u0027s a swell suite,\" whispered Jordan respectfully and every one laughed.\n \"Open another window,\" commanded Daisy, without turning around.\n \"There aren\u0027t any more.\"\n \"Well, we\u0027d better telephone for an axe----\"\n \"The thing to do is to forget about the heat,\" said Tom impatiently.\n \"You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.\"\n He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.\n \"Why not let her alone, old sport?\" remarked Gatsby. \"You\u0027re the one that wanted to come to town.\"\n There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered \"Excuse me\"--but this time no one laughed.\n \"I\u0027ll pick it up,\" I offered.\n \"I\u0027ve got it.\" Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered \"Hum!\" in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\n \"That\u0027s a great expression of yours, isn\u0027t it?\" said Tom sharply.\n \"What is?\"\n \"All this \u0027old sport\u0027 business. Where\u0027d you pick that up?\"\n \"Now see here, Tom,\" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, \"if you\u0027re going to make personal remarks I won\u0027t stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.\"\n As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn\u0027s Wedding March from the ballroom below.\n \"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!\" cried Jordan dismally.\n \"Still--I was married in the middle of June,\" Daisy remembered, \"Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?\"\n \"Biloxi,\" he answered shortly.\n \"A man named Biloxi. \u0027Blocks\u0027 Biloxi, and he made boxes--that\u0027s a fact--and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.\"\n \"They carried him into my house,\" appended Jordan, \"because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.\" After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, \"There wasn\u0027t any connection.\"\n \"I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,\" I remarked.\n \"That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left.\n He gave me an aluminum putter that I use today.\"\n The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of \"Yea--ea--ea!\" and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\n \"We\u0027re getting old,\" said Daisy. \"If we were young we\u0027d rise and dance.\"\n \"Remember Biloxi,\" Jordan warned her. \"Where\u0027d you know him, Tom?\"\n \"Biloxi?\" He concentrated with an effort. \"I didn\u0027t know him. He was a friend of Daisy\u0027s.\"\n \"He was not,\" she denied. \"I\u0027d never seen him before. He came down in the private car.\"\n \"Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville.\n Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.\"\n Jordan smiled.\n \"He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale.\"\n Tom and I looked at each other blankly.\n \"BilOxi?\"\n \"First place, we didn\u0027t have any president----\"\n Gatsby\u0027s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\n \"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you\u0027re an Oxford man.\"\n \"Not exactly.\"\n \"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.\"\n \"Yes--I went there.\"\n A pause. Then Tom\u0027s voice, incredulous and insulting:\n \"You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.\"\n Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his \"Thank you\" and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\n \"I told you I went there,\" said Gatsby.\n \"I heard you, but I\u0027d like to know when.\"\n \"It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That\u0027s why I can\u0027t really call myself an Oxford man.\"\n Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.\n \"It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,\" he continued. \"We could go to any of the universities in England or France.\"\n I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I\u0027d experienced before.\n Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\n \"Open the whiskey, Tom,\" she ordered. \"And I\u0027ll make you a mint julep.\n Then you won\u0027t seem so stupid to yourself.... Look at the mint!\"\n \"Wait a minute,\" snapped Tom, \"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.\"\n \"Go on,\" Gatsby said politely.\n \"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?\"\n They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\n \"He isn\u0027t causing a row.\" Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. \"You\u0027re causing a row. Please have a little self control.\"\n \"Self control!\" repeated Tom incredulously. \"I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.\n Well, if that\u0027s the idea you can count me out.... Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they\u0027ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.\"\n Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.\n \"We\u0027re all white here,\" murmured Jordan.\n \"I know I\u0027m not very popular. I don\u0027t give big parties. I suppose you\u0027ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends--in the modern world.\"\n Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.\n \"I\u0027ve got something to tell YOU, old sport,----\" began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.\n \"Please don\u0027t!\" she interrupted helplessly. \"Please let\u0027s all go home.\n Why don\u0027t we all go home?\"\n \"That\u0027s a good idea.\" I got up. \"Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.\"\n \"I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.\"\n \"Your wife doesn\u0027t love you,\" said Gatsby. \"She\u0027s never loved you.\n She loves me.\"\n \"You must be crazy!\" exclaimed Tom automatically.\n Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\n \"She never loved you, do you hear?\" he cried. \"She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!\"\n At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain--as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.\n \"Sit down Daisy.\" Tom\u0027s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. \"What\u0027s been going on? I want to hear all about it.\"\n \"I told you what\u0027s been going on,\" said Gatsby. \"Going on for five years--and you didn\u0027t know.\"\n Tom turned to Daisy sharply.\n \"You\u0027ve been seeing this fellow for five years?\"\n \"Not seeing,\" said Gatsby. \"No, we couldn\u0027t meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn\u0027t know. I used to laugh sometimes--\"but there was no laughter in his eyes, \"to think that you didn\u0027t know.\"\n \"Oh--that\u0027s all.\" Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.\n \"You\u0027re crazy!\" he exploded. \"I can\u0027t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn\u0027t know Daisy then--and I\u0027ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that\u0027s a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.\"\n \"No,\" said Gatsby, shaking his head.\n \"She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s doing.\" He nodded sagely. \"And what\u0027s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.\"\n \"You\u0027re revolting,\" said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: \"Do you know why we left Chicago? I\u0027m surprised that they didn\u0027t treat you to the story of that little spree.\"\n Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.\n \"Daisy, that\u0027s all over now,\" he said earnestly. \"It doesn\u0027t matter any more. Just tell him the truth--that you never loved him--and it\u0027s all wiped out forever.\"\n She looked at him blindly. \"Why,--how could I love him--possibly?\"\n \"You never loved him.\"\n She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now.\n It was too late.\n \"I never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible reluctance.\n \"Not at Kapiolani?\" demanded Tom suddenly.\n \"No.\"\n From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.\n \"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?\" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. \"... Daisy?\"\n \"Please don\u0027t.\" Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\n She looked at Gatsby. \"There, Jay,\" she said--but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.\n \"Oh, you want too much!\" she cried to Gatsby. \"I love you now--isn\u0027t that enough? I can\u0027t help what\u0027s past.\" She began to sob helplessly.\n \"I did love him once--but I loved you too.\"\n Gatsby\u0027s eyes opened and closed.\n \"You loved me TOO?\" he repeated.\n \"Even that\u0027s a lie,\" said Tom savagely. \"She didn\u0027t know you were alive.\n Why,--there\u0027re things between Daisy and me that you\u0027ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.\"\n The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\n \"I want to speak to Daisy alone,\" he insisted. \"She\u0027s all excited now----\"\n \"Even alone I can\u0027t say I never loved Tom,\" she admitted in a pitiful voice. \"It wouldn\u0027t be true.\"\n \"Of course it wouldn\u0027t,\" agreed Tom.\n She turned to her husband.\n \"As if it mattered to you,\" she said.\n \"Of course it matters. I\u0027m going to take better care of you from now on.\"\n \"You don\u0027t understand,\" said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. \"You\u0027re not going to take care of her any more.\"\n \"I\u0027m not?\" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. \"Why\u0027s that?\"\n \"Daisy\u0027s leaving you.\"\n \"Nonsense.\"\n \"I am, though,\" she said with a visible effort.\n \"She\u0027s not leaving me!\" Tom\u0027s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.\n \"Certainly not for a common swindler who\u0027d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.\"\n \"I won\u0027t stand this!\" cried Daisy. \"Oh, please let\u0027s get out.\"\n \"Who are you, anyhow?\" broke out Tom. \"You\u0027re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem--that much I happen to know. I\u0027ve made a little investigation into your affairs--and I\u0027ll carry it further tomorrow.\"\n \"You can suit yourself about that, old sport.\" said Gatsby steadily.\n \"I found out what your \u0027drug stores\u0027 were.\" He turned to us and spoke rapidly. \"He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drug stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That\u0027s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I wasn\u0027t far wrong.\"\n \"What about it?\" said Gatsby politely. \"I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn\u0027t too proud to come in on it.\"\n \"And you left him in the lurch, didn\u0027t you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of YOU.\"\n \"He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you call me \u0027old sport\u0027!\" cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing.\n \"Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.\"\n That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby\u0027s face.\n \"That drug store business was just small change,\" continued Tom slowly, \"but you\u0027ve got something on now that Walter\u0027s afraid to tell me about.\"\n I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had \"killed a man.\" For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.\n It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.\n The voice begged again to go.\n \"PLEASE, Tom! I can\u0027t stand this any more.\"\n Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage she had had, were definitely gone.\n \"You two start on home, Daisy,\" said Tom. \"In Mr. Gatsby\u0027s car.\"\n She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.\n \"Go on. He won\u0027t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over.\"\n They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts even from our pity.\n After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel.\n \"Want any of this stuff? Jordan?... Nick?\"\n I didn\u0027t answer.\n \"Nick?\" He asked again.\n \"What?\"\n \"Want any?\"\n \"No... I just remembered that today\u0027s my birthday.\"\n I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade.\n It was seven o\u0027clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. Thirty--the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat\u0027s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\n So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.\n The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick in his office--really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson refused, saying that he\u0027d miss a lot of business if he did.\n While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.\n \"I\u0027ve got my wife locked in up there,\" explained Wilson calmly.\n \"She\u0027s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we\u0027re going to move away.\"\n Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn\u0027t working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his wife\u0027s man and not his own.\n So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn\u0027t say a word--instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he\u0027d been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn\u0027t.\n He supposed he forgot to, that\u0027s all. When he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson\u0027s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.\n \"Beat me!\" he heard her cry. \"Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!\"\n A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.\n The \"death car\" as the newspapers called it, didn\u0027t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn\u0027t even sure of its color--he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark blood with the dust.\n Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.\n We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.\n \"Wreck!\" said Tom. \"That\u0027s good. Wilson\u0027ll have a little business at last.\"\n He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until, as we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.\n \"We\u0027ll take a look,\" he said doubtfully, \"just a look.\"\n I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words \"Oh, my God!\" uttered over and over in a gasping moan.\n \"There\u0027s some bad trouble here,\" said Tom excitedly.\n He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.\n The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals disarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\n Myrtle Wilson\u0027s body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a work table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn\u0027t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage--then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call.\n \"O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\"\n Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.\n \"M-a-v--\" the policeman was saying, \"--o----\"\n \"No,--r--\" corrected the man, \"M-a-v-r-o----\"\n \"Listen to me!\" muttered Tom fiercely.\n \"r--\" said the policeman, \"o----\"\n \"g----\"\n \"g--\" He looked up as Tom\u0027s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\n \"What you want, fella?\"\n \"What happened--that\u0027s what I want to know!\"\n \"Auto hit her. Ins\u0027antly killed.\"\n \"Instantly killed,\" repeated Tom, staring.\n \"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn\u0027t even stopus car.\"\n \"There was two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one comin\u0027, one goin\u0027, see?\"\n \"Going where?\" asked the policeman keenly.\n \"One goin\u0027 each way. Well, she--\" His hand rose toward the blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side, \"--she ran out there an\u0027 the one comin\u0027 from N\u0027York knock right into her goin\u0027 thirty or forty miles an hour.\"\n \"What\u0027s the name of this place here?\" demanded the officer.\n \"Hasn\u0027t got any name.\"\n A pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near.\n \"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"big yellow car. New.\"\n \"See the accident?\" asked the policeman.\n \"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster\u0027n forty. Going fifty, sixty.\"\n \"Come here and let\u0027s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name.\"\n Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries.\n \"You don\u0027t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!\"\n Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms.\n \"You\u0027ve got to pull yourself together,\" he said with soothing gruffness.\n Wilson\u0027s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\n \"Listen,\" said Tom, shaking him a little. \"I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we\u0027ve been talking about.\n That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn\u0027t mine, do you hear? I haven\u0027t seen it all afternoon.\"\n Only the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.\n \"What\u0027s all that?\" he demanded.\n \"I\u0027m a friend of his.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson\u0027s body. \"He says he knows the car that did it.... It was a yellow car.\"\n Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\n \"And what color\u0027s your car?\"\n \"It\u0027s a blue car, a coupé.\"\n \"We\u0027ve come straight from New York,\" I said.\n Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away.\n \"Now, if you\u0027ll let me have that name again correct----\"\n Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair and came back.\n \"If somebody\u0027ll come here and sit with him!\" he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered \"Let\u0027s get out.\"\n Self consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\n Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend--then his foot came down hard and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.\n \"The God Damn coward!\" he whimpered. \"He didn\u0027t even stop his car.\"\n The Buchanans\u0027 house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\n \"Daisy\u0027s home,\" he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.\n \"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There\u0027s nothing we can do tonight.\"\n A change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\n As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.\n \"I\u0027ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you\u0027re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper--if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come in.\"\n \"No thanks. But I\u0027d be glad if you\u0027d order me the taxi. I\u0027ll wait outside.\"\n Jordan put her hand on my arm.\n \"Won\u0027t you come in, Nick?\"\n \"No thanks.\"\n I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.\n \"It\u0027s only half past nine,\" she said.\n I\u0027d be damned if I\u0027d go in; I\u0027d had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler\u0027s voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate.\n I hadn\u0027t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.\n \"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\n \"Just standing here, old sport.\"\n Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfshiem\u0027s people,\" behind him in the dark shrubbery.\n \"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\n \"Yes.\"\n He hesitated.\n \"Was she killed?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It\u0027s better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\n He spoke as if Daisy\u0027s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\n \"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in my garage. I don\u0027t think anybody saw us but of course I can\u0027t be sure.\"\n I disliked him so much by this time that I didn\u0027t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.\n \"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\n \"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?\"\n \"Well, I tried to swing the wheel----\" He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.\n \"Was Daisy driving?\"\n \"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I\u0027ll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly.\"\n \"It ripped her open----\"\n \"Don\u0027t tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow--Daisy stepped on it.\n I tried to make her stop, but she couldn\u0027t so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\n \"She\u0027ll be all right tomorrow,\" he said presently. \"I\u0027m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She\u0027s locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality she\u0027s going to turn the light out and on again.\"\n \"He won\u0027t touch her,\" I said. \"He\u0027s not thinking about her.\"\n \"I don\u0027t trust him, old sport.\"\n \"How long are you going to wait?\"\n \"All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed.\"\n A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it--he might think anything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy\u0027s room on the second floor.\n \"You wait here,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll see if there\u0027s any sign of a commotion.\"\n I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found a rift at the sill.\n Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\n They weren\u0027t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale--and yet they weren\u0027t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.\n As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.\n \"Is it all quiet up there?\" he asked anxiously.\n \"Yes, it\u0027s all quiet.\" I hesitated. \"You\u0027d better come home and get some sleep.\"\n He shook his head.\n \"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\"\n He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight--watching over nothing.\n 正在人们对盖茨比的好奇心达到顶点的时候，有一个星期六晚上他别墅里的灯都没有亮——于是，他作为特里马尔乔的生涯，当初莫名其妙地开始，现在又莫名其妙地结束了，我逐渐发觉那些乘兴而来的一辆辆汽车，稍停片刻之后又扫兴地开走了。我疑心他是否病了，于是走过去看看——一个面目狰狞的陌生仆人从门口满腹狐疑地斜着眼看我。\n “盖茨比先生病了吗？”\n “没有。”停了一会他才慢吞吞地、勉勉强强地加了一声“先生”。\n “我好久没看见他了，很不放心。告诉他卡罗威先生来过。”\n “谁？”他粗鲁地问。\n “卡罗威。”\n “卡罗威。好啦，我告诉他。”\n 他粗鲁地砰的一声关上了大门。\n 我的芬兰女佣人告诉我，盖茨比早在一个星期前就辞退了家里的每一个仆人，另外雇用了五六个人，这些人从来不到西卵镇上去受那些仟店的贿赂，而是打电话订购数量不多的生活用品。据食品店送货的伙计报道，厨房看上去像个猪圈，而镇上一般的看法是，这些新人压根儿不是什么仆人。\n 第二天盖茨比打电话给我。\n “准备出门吗？”我问。\n “没有，老兄。”\n “我听说你把所有的仆人都辞了。”\n “我需要的是不爱讲闲话的人。黛西经常来——总是在下千。”\n 原来如此，由于她看了不赞成，这座大酒店就像纸牌搭的房子一样整个坍掉了。\n “他们是沃尔夫山姆要给帮点儿忙的人。他们都是兄弟姐妹。他们开过一家小旅馆。”\n “我明白了。”\n 他是应黛西的请求打电话来的——我明天是否可以到她家吃午饭？贝克小姐会去的。半小时之后，黛西亲自打电话来，似乎因为知道我答应去而感到宽慰。一定出了什么事。然而我却不能相信他们竞然会选这样一个场合来大闹一场——尤其是盖茨比早先在花园里所提出的那种令人难堪的场面。\n 第二天天气酷热，夏日几乎要终结，然而这也无疑是夏天中最热的一天。当我乘的火车从地道里钻出来驶进阳光里时，只有全国饼干公司热辣辣的汽笛打破了中午闷热的静寂。客车里的草椅垫热得简直要着火了。坐在我旁边的一个妇女起先很斯文地让汗水渗透衬衣，后来，她的报纸在她手指下面也变潮了时，她长叹一声，在酷热中颓然地往后一倒。她的钱包啪的一声掉到了地下。\n “哎哟！”她吃惊地喊道。\n 我懒洋洋地弯下腰把它捡了起来，递还给了她，手伸得远远的，捏着钱包的一个角，表示我并无染指的意图——可是附近的每一个人，包括那女人，照样怀疑我。\n “热！”查票员对面熟的乘客说，“够呛的天气！热……热……热……你觉得够热的吗？热吗？你觉得……”\n 我的月季票递还给我时上面留下了他手上的黑汗渍。在这种酷热的天气还有谁去管他亲吻的是谁的朱唇，管他是谁的脑袋偎湿了他胸前的睡衣口袋！\n ……盖茨比和我在门口等开门的时候，一阵微风吹过布坎农的住宅的门廊，带来电话铃的声音。\n “主人的尸体？”男管家大声向话筒里嚷道，“对不起，太太，可是我们不能提供——今天中午太热了，没法碰！”\n 实际上他讲的是：“是……是……我去瞧瞧。”\n 他放下了话筒，朝我们走过来，头上冒着汗珠，接过我们的硬壳草帽。\n “夫人在客厅里等您哩！”他喊道，一面不必要地指着方向。在这酷热的大气，每一个多余的手势都是滥用生活的公有财富。\n 这间屋子外面有这篷挡着，又阴暗又凉快。黛西和乔丹躺在一张巨大的长沙发上，好像两座银像压住自己的白色衣裙，不让电扇的呼呼响的风吹动。\n “我们动不了了。”她们俩同声说。\n 乔丹的手指，黝黑色上面搽了一层白粉，在我手指里搁了一会。\n “体育家托马斯·布坎农先生呢？”我问。\n 就在同时我听见了他的声音，粗犷、低沉、沙哑，正在用门廓的电话与什么人通着话。\n 盖茨比站在绯红的地毯中央，用着了迷的目光向四周张望。黛西看着他，发出了她那甜蜜、动人的笑声。微微的一阵粉从她胸口升入空中。\n “有谣言说，”乔丹悄悄地说，“那边是汤姆的情人在打电话。”\n 我们都不说话。门廊里的声音气恼地提高了：“那好吧，我根本不把车子卖给你了……我根本不欠你什么情……至于你在午饭时候来打扰我，我根本不答应！”\n “挂上话筒在讲。”黛西冷嘲热讽地说。\n “不，他不是。”我向她解释道，“这是一笔确有其事的交易。我碰巧知道这件事。”\n 汤姆猛然推开了门，他粗壮的身躯片刻间堵住了门口，然后急匆匆走进了屋子。\n “盖茨比先生！”他伸出了他那宽大、扁平的手，很成功地掩饰住了对他的厌恶，“我很高兴见到您，先生……尼克……”\n “给我们来一杯冷饮吧！”黛西大声说。\n 他又离开屋子以后，她站起身来，走到盖茨比面前，把他的脸拉了下来，吻他的嘴。\n “你知道我爱你。”她喃喃地说。\n “你忘了还有一位女客在座。”乔丹说。\n 黛西故意装傻回过头看看。\n “你也跟尼克接吻吧。”\n “多低级、多下流的女孩子！”\n “我不在乎！”黛西大声说，同时在砖砌的壁炉前面跳起舞来。后来她想起了酷热的天气，又不好意思地在沙发上坐了下来，正在这时一个穿着新洗的衣服的保姆搀着一个小女孩走进屋子来。\n “心——肝，宝——贝，”她嗲声嗲气地说，一面伸出她的胳臂，“到疼你的亲娘这里来。”\n 保姆一撒手，小孩就从屋子那边跑过来，羞答答地一头埋进她母亲的衣裙里。\n “心——肝，宝——贝啊！妈妈把粉弄到你黄黄的头发上了吗？站起身来，说声——您好。”\n 盖茨比和我先后弯下腰来，握一握她不情愿地伸出的小手。然后他惊奇地盯着孩子看。我想他以前从来没有真正相信过有这个孩子存在。\n “我在午饭前就打扮好了。”孩子说，急切地把脸转向黛西。\n “那是因为你妈要显摆你。”她低下头来把脸伏在雪白的小脖子上唯一的皱纹里，‘你啊，你这个宝贝。你这个独一无二的小宝贝。”\n “是啊，”小孩平静地答应，“乔丹阿姨也穿了一件白衣裳。”\n “你喜欢妈妈的朋友吗？”黛西把她转过来，让她面对着盖茨比，“你觉得他们漂亮吗？”\n “爸爸在哪儿？”\n “她长得不像她父亲，”黛西解释说，“她长得像我。她的头发和脸形都像我。”\n 黛西朝后靠在沙发上。保姆走上前一步，伸出了手。\n “来吧，帕咪。”\n “再见，乖乖！”\n 很懂规矩的小孩依依不舍地回头看了一眼，抓着保姆的手，就被拉到门外去，正好汤姆回来，后面跟着四杯杜松子利克酒，里面装满了冰块喀嚓作响。\n 盖茨比端过一杯酒来。\n “这酒绝对凉。”他说，看得出来他有点紧张。\n 我们迫不及待地大口大口地把酒喝下去。\n “我在什么地方看到过，说太阳一年比一年热，”汤姆很和气地说，“好像地球不久就会掉进太阳里去——等一等——恰恰相反——太阳一年比一年冷。”\n “到外面来吧，”他向盖茨比提议说，“我想请你看看我这个地方。”\n 我跟他们一起到外面游廊上去。在绿色的海湾上，海水在酷热中停滞不动，一条小帆船慢慢向比较新鲜的海水移动。盖茨比的眼光片刻间追随着这条船。他举起了手，指着海湾的\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/319/3079.html","bookId":159,"book":{"id":159,"title":"了不起的盖茨比 The Great Gatsby","description":"简介： The Great Gatsby is a novel by the American author F.
