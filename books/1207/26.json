{"id":18847,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXV","content":"Mad merry Yule-tide was in full possession of London as the coach containing the Lady Rebecca and her party posted up from Plymouth. Rolfe eagerly pointed out to Pocahontas the various places of interest as they came into South Wark. “Here on our left, sweetheart, is Erber House, once the home of Sir Francis Drake. See that round tower lying to the west of it? That is Paris Garden, where the common folk resort to witness the bear-baiting. Yonder to the northeast rises the Tower of London. Long ago its walls resounded with mirth and feasting, now it is a gloomy prison house. Now turn your dear eyes to the northwest, here, in this direction. That pile of buildings is Whitehall, where King James holds court. Inigo Jones, the famous architect, is building a magnificent banqueting hall there for the sovereign, and—Why, what is the matter now? Our coach has come to a standstill,” he said abruptly. Putting his head out of the window, Rolfe saw a crowd of revelers dressed in173 fantastic garb surging around the six white horses drawing the coach. The oaths of the postilion were met by the jeers of the mob swinging upon the bridle reins. “Make way for the Lady Rebecca of Virginia, you scum of South Wark. She is the King’s guest!” shouted the angry jehu. “Is that the commodity you carry? Up, my merry men, let’s have a look at her,” exclaimed the ringleader. Up on the wheels scrambled three or four adventurous spirits, to peer through the coach windows at the famous Indian princess. “She is fairly well-favored, saving her copper skin,” sang out the Lord of Misrule. The sound of his voice attracted the attention of Adam, seated beside the postilion. “By my soul, ’tis scatterbrain Jack Saunders. Halloa there! Jack, don’t you remember your old comrade?” “Father Christmas! If ’tis not bottle-nose Adam Clotworthy. I would know your ill-favored visage in Africa. Say, man, how did you escape the scalping-knife, and what has become of the Falstaff paunch you carried about?” “My own prowess kept off the savages,”174 replied Adam. “As to my paunch, I had to consume my own fat during the Starving Time, like the bears over yonder do in winter. Say, lad, I thought you had been buried long ago by your ranting spouse, Meg. Her temper must have improved vastly to allow you to go junketing around like this.” Jack scratched his shock head, and whispered with a sly wink, “She thinks I am down at Deptford, looking after repairs on old Sir Francis Drake’s ship. Come down, Adam, and have a cup of ale for the sake of old times. We will go to the tavern hard by and make a roaring night of it.” Adam shook his head and drew himself up proudly. “I cannot, Jack, I am body-servant to Master John Rolfe, husband of the Lady Rebecca. Besides, there is a little lad in there whom I love as if he were mine own. I have to keep straight for his sake.” While this conversation was taking place, and the revelers were still tormenting the driver, a band of London apprentices, with clubs in their hands and flat caps on their heads, were coming at a swinging pace across London Bridge, from the north side of the Thames. On perceiving the revelers blocking the way, they raised the cry of “Clubs, clubs!” and bore down upon the175 mummers. Swinging their cudgels right and left upon the heads of the luckless maskers, they quickly cut a wide path for the coach. Down upon the plunging horses came the long curling whip of the postilion. Smarting under the stinging lash, they plunged forward under the gateway of London Bridge, surmounted by a row of ghastly heads set on pikes; and sweeping forward across the bridge, swerved to the left, rattled down the street echoing with the postilion’s horn, and drew up with a flourish before the Mermaid Inn. Out came the obsequious host with many bows to greet them. “Why, Master Rolfe, you are a sight to gladden the heart. And this is the Lady Rebecca, your wife? I need not tell you, honored madam, that all London welcomes you.” “Yes,” said Rolfe, “we have just had a sample of their good will on South Wark side of the Thames.” “The Lady De La Warre was here a week ago come Tuesday, to engage rooms for your party, Master Rolfe. They are in readiness and I will conduct you to them,” said the landlord. Up a crooked stairway went Pocahontas, followed by her party, to a suite of rooms176 overlooking the Thames. Wreaths of holly and mistletoe hung from the ceiling and twined around portraits of King James and Queen Elizabeth. Through the diamond-paned window could be seen the shipping plying back and forth upon the river. While our friends were seated at breakfast the next morning a servant appeared with the information that Lady De La Warre waited below to pay a visit to the Lady Rebecca. Rolfe hastened down to conduct this lady to the presence of his wife. In came the stately dame, rustling in violet silk and Flanders lace. “Welcome to London, Lady Rebecca,” she said. “My husband has often told me of your many kindnesses to our colony in Virginia. I feel that we are already acquaint.” Both ladies curtsied low to each other, each taking note of the other’s appearance in the meanwhile. When they were seated Lady De La Warre said to Pocahontas, “It will give me much pleasure to present you at court. I have many skilled needlewomen waiting to provide you with a suitable robe.” “Pocahontas thanks Lady De La Warre177 for her kind interest. She is happy to be in the land of the pale-faces.” “You must come and be my guest until after your appearance at court. My lord seconds the invitation and sends greetings. He is away now with the King, who is hunting at Theobalds.” “Please convey our sincere respects to your noble lord, my lady. Your kind invitation we gladly accept,” replied Rolfe, answering for his wife. “Now I must take my departure,” said Lady De La Warre, rising. “I will send my coach for you to-morrow.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2860/79058.html","bookId":1207,"book":{"id":1207,"title":"The Daughter of Virginia Dare","description":"简介： The sunbeams were playing hide and seek with the ripples around the prows of three small vessels lying at anchor in the harbor of Portsmouth.
