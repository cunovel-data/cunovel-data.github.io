{"id":18827,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V","content":"Arriving at Jamestown, the exploring party came upon a scene of utter confusion, misery, and fright. As they hastily landed they were met by Chaplain Hunt, whose sad face foreboded evil tidings. “Your prophecy has come true, Smith. Want of proper vigilance and the lack of a fort have been our undoing. Last night while all were asleep we were surprised by the Indians and many of our men are dead. Fear has taken hold of the others to such an extent they seem paralyzed, and will not stir to provide protection. All are determined to leave with Captain Newport for home. I hope that your coming will restore their courage.” “Why does not Wingfield compel the men to go to work?” inquired Smith. Mr. Hunt shrugged his shoulders, and with a gesture of helplessness replied: “Wingfield, I am sorry to say, thinks only of himself. He has no feeling of responsibility or pity for his men. I know you for a man of courage and a Christian. My only hope lies in you. 59 “I can do so little. Every move or suggestion I make is looked upon with suspicion and jealousy. God knows I have no selfish end in view, and I can only trust Him and wait.” The coming of Captain Smith, with his courage and perseverance, insensibly restored the spirits of the colonists. After he had talked to them and urged them not to abandon the settlement they consented to try a while longer, but no sooner was order restored than Wingfield and his satellites set to work to breed envy and suspicion of the brave soldier. One morning after daily prayer had been said, the Rev. Mr. Hunt spoke to the assembled men about their jealousy and suspicion of Captain Smith. “My friends,” said he, “we have come across to this land together, here to found a home for ourselves and be a help to the benighted savage. Let us put aside envy and backbiting, and trust one another. Each one of us has a duty to perform in planting the English nation upon this soil, and let us not forget the great end we have in view, of bringing these poor savages to love and serve their Maker. Let us treat them with forbearance and patience, making no retaliation for the wrong done60 us. We must bear in mind that Ralph Lane’s men, in killing a poor savage for the loss of a paltry silver cup, first taught the Indian hatred for the white man. Before that time all was peace and love between them. They listened gladly to the story of the Heavenly Father’s love, and even stroked their bodies with the Word of God, thinking in their simple way that mere contact would bring a blessing. But I must speak to you of one other thing. “There is one among you, courageous and God-fearing, who has your interest alone at heart. In return for all his kindness you have given him pain and heartache. Is this the spirit of a Christian? Can we teach brotherly love to the savage when we lack it among ourselves? Is it honest and manly treatment? I speak to you as man to man. Look into your hearts and see if you have done as you would be done by, and then repenting of your lack of charity, extend the hand of comradeship to him.” As they quietly listened to the words of the priest, over many faces stole a look of shame and repentance; but some still sat with unmoved countenances, among them Wingfield and his particular friends. Captain Newport now made ready to return61 to England with his shipload of clapboards hewn from the virgin forests surrounding the settlement. The pinnace was to be left behind for exploring expeditions as had been commanded by the London Company. On the voyage to Virginia much of the food supply had been spoilt and what was left was recklessly squandered. As long as the returning ships stayed the sailors exchanged the food, which they had for the voyage back to England, for tobacco and other possessions of the settlers. After they left it became necessary to place each man on an allowance of food. A half pint of wheat and barley boiled in water served as a day’s allowance. President Wingfield, however, had taken care to provide beef, oatmeal, and sack for his private use. He now saw fit to issue orders for the building of the long-needed fort, and the men were put to work cutting down palisades and bearing them to the appointed place. Few of them could be prevailed upon to work in their weakened condition, and of those who did many died from exhaustion. The provisions of Wingfield were now nearly spent, and as he had no intention62 of sharing the lot of the colonists, he and his friends plotted to seize the pinnace and sail for the mother country. One day John Laydon, returning from work on the fort, overheard the conspirators talking together behind a clump of bushes, and he immediately reported the matter to the Chaplain. Hastily seeking out Captain Smith, Mr. Hunt repeated the story told him by Laydon. “What shall we do, Smith? At all costs such an outrage must be prevented.” “After evening prayer, when all of the men are together, I will disclose the plot,” replied the Captain. When the clock struck four the idle and the industrious alike assembled under the stretched sail. There were the unsuspecting and the plotters sitting side by side, and as the priest looked upon them he could not keep the tremor out of his voice as he thought of the helplessness of some and the treachery of the others. When the last words of the blessing had been said, Captain Smith arose and told them of the plot. As he pictured the selfishness of Wingfield, his cruel treatment, and worst of all his intention of seizing the pinnace, the anger of the men rose to white heat. 63 “He shall not be President any longer!” cried one. Immediately the cry was taken up by the others, and Wingfield cringed in fear of his life. A vote was then taken to elect a new President. Surely Captain Smith would be chosen; but no, the seed of suspicion sown by Wingfield had taken root. The colonists were not yet ready to trust Captain Smith. Ratcliffe, the accomplice of Wingfield, was elected in his stead. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2860/79038.html","bookId":1207,"book":{"id":1207,"title":"The Daughter of Virginia Dare","description":"简介： The sunbeams were playing hide and seek with the ripples around the prows of three small vessels lying at anchor in the harbor of Portsmouth.
