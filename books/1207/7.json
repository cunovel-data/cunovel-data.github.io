{"id":18828,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI","content":"Under the new President matters went from bad to worse. Fall was now approaching and the decaying vegetation was sending up deadly miasmas to poison the air. “Food, food!” was the daily cry of the colonists. The deadly fear of Opechancanough and his men filled their dreams at night with terrible crimes. Many a man awoke with the cold perspiration bathing his brow, only to find his dream come true. A cry—a prayer—a silence! Sitting idly around, they bemoaned their fate and talked of the comforts they had left behind. Would they had never left the shores of England! There at least they might have found food. But even as they sat and talked, a ministering angel, sent by God, was on her way to them. Sculling down the James came Pocahontas for her first visit to Jamestown. The bottom of her canoe was filled with corn and wild turkeys which she was bringing as a present to Captain Smith. Fearlessly stepping on shore, she came directly toward a group of men sitting under a tree. 65 “Where is your chief?” she asked. Thinking that she meant Ratcliffe, one of the men hastened to call him. But when he appeared the little guest shook her head and said, “Not the one of the lowering brow, but the one with the shining body.” Then they knew she meant Captain Smith and just then he appeared. Pleased recognition lighted up her countenance as she saw him. “Pocahontas has come as she promised, and to show her love has brought food for the great chief.” “Many times welcome, O Pocahontas,” he replied. “The Great Spirit of the pale faces has moved your heart to come to our aid.” Then he showed her the church where the pale faces worshiped, and gave her presents of bells and beads, and she lingered a long time with them and seemed loath to depart. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2860/79039.html","bookId":1207,"book":{"id":1207,"title":"The Daughter of Virginia Dare","description":"简介： The sunbeams were playing hide and seek with the ripples around the prows of three small vessels lying at anchor in the harbor of Portsmouth.
