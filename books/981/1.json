{"id":29903,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"\"Tell \u0027em to look sharp, Bert. This pickup\u0027s got to be good.\" Kevin Morrow gulped the last of his coffee and felt its bitter acid gurgle around his stomach. He stared moodily through the plastic port where the spangled skirt of stars glittered against the black satin of endless night and a familiar curve of the space station swung ponderously around its hub. Four space-suited tugmen floated languidly outside the rim. Beyond them the gleaming black and white moonship tugged gently at her mooring lines, as though anxious to be off. Bert Alexander radioed quiet instructions to the tugmen. \"Why the hell couldn\u0027t he stay down there and mind his own business?\" Kevin growled. \"McKelvie\u0027s been after our hide ever since we got the appropriation, and now this.\" He slapped the flimsy radio-gram. He looked up as the control room hatch opened. Jones came in from the astronomy section. \"Morning, commander,\" he said. \"You guys had breakfast yet? Mess closes in 30 minutes.\" Kevin shook his head. \"We\u0027re not hungry,\" Bert filled in. \"You think you\u0027ve got nerves?\" Jones chuckled. \"I just looked in on Mark. He\u0027s sleeping like a baby. You wouldn\u0027t think the biggest day of his life is three hours away.\" \"McKelvie\u0027s coming up to kibitz,\" Morrow said. \"McKelvie!\" \"The one and only,\" Bert said. \"Here, read all about it.\" He handed over the morning facsimile torn off the machine when the station hurtled over New England at 18,000 miles an hour. The upper half of the sheet bore a picture of the white-maned senator. Clearly etched on his face were the lines of too many half-rigged elections, too many compromises. Beneath the picture were quotes from his speech the night before. \"As chairman of your congressional watchdog committee,\" the senator had said, \"I\u0027ll see that there\u0027s no more waste and corruption on this space project. For three years they\u0027ve been building a rocket—the moon rocket, they call it—out there at the space station. \"I haven\u0027t seen that rocket,\" the senator had continued. \"All I\u0027ve seen is five billion of your tax dollars flying into the vacuum of space. They tell me a man named Mark Kramer is going to fly out in that rocket and circle the moon. \"But he will fail,\" McKelvie had promised. \"If God had intended man to fly to the moon, he would have given us wings to do it. Tomorrow I shall fly out to this space station, even at the risk of my life. I\u0027ll report the waste and corruption out there, and I\u0027ll report the failure of the moon rocket.\" Jones crumpled the paper and aimed at the waste basket. \"Pardon me while I vomit,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve been there,\" Kevin sighed deeply. \"I suppose Max Gordon will be happy.\" \"He\u0027ll wear a hole in his tongue on McKelvie\u0027s boots,\" Bert said bitterly. \"Is it that bad?\" \"How else would he get a first class spaceman\u0027s badge?\" Morrow said. \"He can\u0027t add two and two. But if stool pigeons had wings, he\u0027d fly like a jet. We can\u0027t move up here without McKelvie knowing and howling about it. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Jones said, \"If the moon rocket makes it, public opinion will take care of the senator.\" \"If he doesn\u0027t take care of us first,\" Kevin said darkly. \"He\u0027ll be aboard in 15 minutes.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3073/84884.html","bookId":981,"book":{"id":981,"title":"Slow Burn","description":"简介： Tell \u0027em to look sharp, Bert.
