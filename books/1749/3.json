{"id":71104,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"He had. Foster was amazed at the volume of correspondence dealing with small disputed points of ancient Mediterranean culture which somehow managed to elicit the casual remark over and over again: \"Of course, having never made use of chronoscopy-\" or, \"Pending approval of my request for chronoscopic data, which appear unlikely at the moment-\"\n \"Now these aren\u0027t blind questionings,\" said Potterley. \"There\u0027s a monthly booklet put out by the Institute for Chronoscopy in which items concerning the past as determined by time viewing are printed. Just one or two items.\n \"What impressed me first was the triviality of most of the items, their insipidity. Why should such researches get priority over my work? So I wrote to people who would be most likely to do research in the directions described in the booklet. Uniformly, as I have shown you, they did not make use of the chronoscope. Now let\u0027s go over it point by point.\"\n At last Foster, his head swimming with Potterley\u0027s meticulously gathered details, asked, \"But why?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know why,\" said Potterley, \"but I have a theory. The original invention of the chronoscope was by Sterbinski-you see, I know that much -and it was well publicized. But then the government took over the instrument and decided to suppress further research in the matter or any use of the machine. But then, people might be curious as to why it wasn\u0027t being used. Curiosity is such a vice, Dr. Foster.\"\n Yes, agreed the physicist to himself.\n \"Imagine the effectiveness, then,\" Potterley went on, \"of pretending that the chronoscope was being used. It would then be not a mystery, but a commonplace. It would no longer be a fitting object for legitimate curiosity or an attractive one for illicit curiosity.\"\n \"You were curious,\" pointed out Foster.\n Potterley looked a trifle restless. \"It was different in my case,\" he said angrily. \"I have something that must be done, and I wouldn\u0027t submit to the ridiculous way in which they kept putting me off.\"\n A bit paranoid, too, thought Foster gloomily.\n Yet he had ended up with something, paranoid or not. Foster could no longer deny that something peculiar was going on in the matter of neutrinics.\n But what was Potterley after? That still bothered Foster. If Potterley didn\u0027t intend this as a test of Foster\u0027s ethics, what did he want?\n Foster put it to himself logically. If an intellectual anarchist with a touch of paranoia wanted to use a chronoscope and was convinced that the powers-that-be were deliberately standing in his way, what would he do?\n Supposing it were I, he thought. What would I do?\n He said slowly, \"Maybe the chronoscope doesn\u0027t exist at all?\"\n Potterley started. There was almost a crack in his general calmness. For an instant, Foster found himself catching a glimpse of something not at all calm.\n But the historian kept his balance and said, \"Oh, no, there must be a chronoscope.\"\n \"Why? Have you seen it? Have I? Maybe that\u0027s the explanation of everything. Maybe they\u0027re not deliberately holding out on a chronoscope they\u0027ve got. Maybe they haven\u0027t got it in the first place.\"\n \"But Sterbinski lived. He built a chronoscope. That much is a fact.\"\n \"The books say so,\" said Foster coldly.\n \"Now listen.\" Potterley actually reached over and snatched at Foster\u0027s jacket sleeve. \"I need the chronoscope. I must have it. Don\u0027t tell me it doesn\u0027t exist. What we\u0027re going to do is find out enough about neutrinics to be able to-\"\n Potterley drew himself up short.\n Foster drew his sleeve away. He needed no ending to that sentence. He supplied it himself. He said, \"Build one of our own?\"\n Potterley looked sour as though he would rather not have said it point-blank. Nevertheless, he said, \"Why not?\"\n \"Because that\u0027s out of the question,\" said Foster. \"If what I\u0027ve read is correct, then it took Sterbinski twenty years to build his machine and several millions in composite grants. Do you think you and I can duplicate that illegally? Suppose we had the time, which we haven\u0027t, and suppose I could learn enough out of books, which I doubt, where would we get the money and equipment? The chronoscope is supposed to fill a five-story building, for Heaven\u0027s sake.\"\n \"Then you won\u0027t help me?\"\n \"Well, I\u0027ll tell you what. I have one way in which I may be able to find out something-\"\n \"What is that?\" asked Potterley at once.\n \"Never mind. That\u0027s not important. But I may be able to find out enough to tell you whether the government is deliberately suppressing research by chronoscope. I may confirm the evidence you already have or I may be able to prove that your evidence is misleading. I don\u0027t know what good it will do you in either case, but it\u0027s as far as I can go. It\u0027s my limit.\"\n Potterley watched the young man go finally. He was angry with himself. Why had he allowed himself to grow so careless as to permit the fellow to guess that he was thinking in terms of a chronoscope of his own. That was premature.\n But then why did the young fool have to suppose that a chronoscope might not exist at all?\n It had to exist. It had to. What was the use of saying it didn\u0027t?\n And why couldn\u0027t a second one be built? Science had advanced in the fifty years since Sterbinski. All that was needed was knowledge.\n Let the youngster gather knowledge. Let him think a small gathering would be his limit. Having taken the path to anarchy, there would be no limit. If the boy were not driven onward by something in himself, the first steps would be error enough to force the rest. Potterley was quite certain he would not hesitate to use blackmail.\n Potterley waved a last good-by and looked up. It was beginning to rain.\n Certainly! Blackmail if necessary, but he would not be stopped.\n Foster steered his car across the bleak outskirts of town and scarcely noticed the rain.\n He was a fool, he told himself, but he couldn\u0027t leave things as they were. He had to know. He damned his streak of undisciplined curiosity, but he had to know.\n But he would go no further than Uncle Ralph. He swore mightily to himself that it would stop there. In that way, there would be no evidence against him, no real evidence. Uncle Ralph would be discreet.\n In a way, he was secretly ashamed of Uncle Ralph. He hadn\u0027t mentioned him to Potterley partly out of caution and partly because he did not wish to witness the lifted eyebrow, the inevitable half-smile. Professional science writers, however useful, were a little outside the pale, fit only for patronizing contempt. The fact that, as a class, they made more money than did research scientists only made matters worse, of course.\n Still, there were times when a science writer in the family could be a convenience. Not being really educated, they did not have to specialize. Consequently, a good science writer knew practically everything... And Uncle Ralph was one of the best.\n Ralph Nimmo had no college degree and was rather proud of it. \"A degree,\" he once said to Jonas Foster, when both were considerably younger, \"is a first step down a ruinous highway. You don\u0027t want to waste it so you go on to graduate work and doctoral research. You end up a thoroughgoing ignoramus on everything in the world except for one subdivisional sliver of nothing.\n \"On the other hand, if you guard your mind carefully and keep it blank of any clutter of information till maturity is reached, filling it only with intelligence and training it only in clear thinking, you then have a powerful instrument at your disposal and you can become a science writer.\"\n Nimmo received his first assignment at the age of twenty-five, after he had completed his apprenticeship and been out in the field for less than three months. It came in the shape of a clotted manuscript whose language would impart no glimmering of understanding to any reader, however qualified, without careful study and some inspired guesswork. Nimmo took it apart and put it together again (after five long and exasperating interviews with the authors, who were biophysicists), making the language taut and meaningful and smoothing the style to a pleasant gloss.\n \"Why not?\" he would say tolerantly to his nephew, who countered his strictures on degrees by berating him with his readiness to hang on the fringes of science. \"The fringe is important. Your scientists can\u0027t write. Why should they be expected to? They aren\u0027t expected to be grand masters at chess or virtuosos at the violin, so why expect them to know how to put words together? Why not leave that for specialists, too?\"\n \"Good Lord, Jonas, read your literature of a hundred years ago. Discount the fact that the science is out of date and that some of the expressions are out of date. Just try to read it and make sense out of it. It\u0027s just jaw-cracking, amateurish. Pages are published uselessly; whole articles which are either noncomprehensible or both.\"\n \"But you don\u0027t get recognition, Uncle Ralph,\" protested young Foster, who was getting ready to start his college career and was rather starry-eyed about it. \"You could be a terrific researcher.\"\n \"I get recognition,\" said Nimmo. \"Don\u0027t think for a minute I don\u0027t. Sure, a biochemist or a strato-meteorologist won\u0027t give me the time of day, but they pay me well enough. Just find out what happens when some first-class; chemist finds the Commission has cut his year\u0027s allowance for science writing. He\u0027ll fight harder for enough funds to afford me, or someone like me,, than to get a recording ionograph.\"\n He grinned broadly and Foster grinned back. Actually, he was proud of his paunchy, round-faced, stub-fingered uncle, whose vanity made him brush his fringe of hair futilely over the desert on his pate and made him dress like an unmade haystack because such negligence was his trademark. Ashamed, but proud, too.\n And now Foster entered his uncle\u0027s cluttered apartment in no mood at all for grinning. He was nine years older now and so was Uncle Ralph. For nine more years, papers in every branch of science had come to him for polishing and a little of each had crept into his capacious mind.\n Nimmo was eating seedless grapes, popping them into his mouth one at a time. He tossed a bunch to Foster who caught them by a hair, then bent to retrieve individual grapes that had torn loose and fallen to the floor.\n \"Let them be. Don\u0027t bother,\" said Nimmo carelessly. \"Someone comes in here to clean once a week. What\u0027s up? Having trouble with your grant application write-up?\"\n \"I haven\u0027t really got into that yet.\"\n \"You haven\u0027t? Get a move on, boy. Are you waiting for me to offer to do the final arrangement?\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t afford you, Uncle.\"\n \"Aw, come on. It\u0027s all in the family. Grant me all popular publication rights and no cash need change hands.\"\n Foster nodded. \"If you\u0027re serious, it\u0027s a deal.\"\n \"It\u0027s a deal.\"\n It was a gamble, of course, but Foster knew enough of Nimmo\u0027s science writing to realize it could pay off. Some dramatic discovery of public interest on primitive man or on a new surgical technique, or on any branch of spationautics could mean a very cash-attracting article in any of the mass media of communication.\n It was Nimmo, for instance, who had written up, for scientific consumption, the series of papers by Bryce and co-workers that elucidated the fine structure of two cancer viruses, for which job he asked the picayune payment of fifteen hundred dollars, provided popular publication rights were included. He then wrote up, exclusively, the same work in semidramatic form for use in trimensional video for a twenty-thousand-dollar advance plus rental royalties that were still coming in after five years.\n Foster said bluntly, \"What do you know about neutrinics, Uncle?\"\n \"Neutrinics?\" Nimmo\u0027s small eyes looked surprised. \"Are you working in that? I thought it was pseudo-gravitic optics.\"\n \"It is p.g.o. I just happen to be asking about neutrinics.\"\n \"That\u0027s a devil of a thing to be doing. You\u0027re stepping out of line. You know that, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"I don\u0027t expect you to call the Commission because I\u0027m a little curious about things.\"\n \"Maybe I should before you get into trouble. Curiosity is an occupational danger with scientists. I\u0027ve watched it work. One of them will be moving quietly along on a problem, then curiosity leads him up a strange creek. Next thing you know they\u0027ve done so little on their proper problem, they can\u0027t justify for a project renewal. I\u0027ve seen more-\"\n \"All I want to know,\" said Foster patiently, \"is what\u0027s been passing through your hands lately on neutrinics.\"\n Nimmo leaned back, chewing at a grape thoughtfully. \"Nothing. Nothing ever. I don\u0027t recall ever getting a paper on neutrinics.\"\n \"What!\" Foster was openly astonished. \"Then who does get the work?\"\n \"Now that you ask,\" said Nimmo, \"I don\u0027t know. Don\u0027t recall anyone talking about it at the annual conventions. I don\u0027t think much work is being done there.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Hey, there, don\u0027t bark. I\u0027m not doing anything. My guess would be-\"\n Foster was exasperated. \"Don\u0027t you know?\"\n \"Hmp. I\u0027ll tell you what I know about neutrinics. It concerns the applications of neutrino movements and the forces involved-\"\n \"Sure. Sure. Just as electronics deals with the applications of electron movements and the forces involved, and pseudo-gravities deals with the applications of artificial gravitational fields. I didn\u0027t come to you for that. Is that all you know?\"\n \"And,\" said Nimmo with equanimity, \"neutrinics is the basis of time viewing and that is all I know.\"\n Foster slouched back in his chair and massaged one lean cheek with great intensity. He felt angrily dissatisfied. Without formulating it explicitly in his own mind, he had felt sure, somehow, that Nimmo would come up with some late reports, bring up interesting facets of modern neutrinics, send him back to Potterley able to say that the elderly historian was mistaken, that his data was misleading, his deductions mistaken.\n Then he could have returned to his proper work.\n But now...\n He told himself angrily: So they\u0027re not doing much work in the field. Does that make it deliberate suppression? What if neutrinics is a sterile discipline? Maybe it is. I don\u0027t know. Potterley doesn\u0027t. Why waste the intellectual resources of humanity on nothing? Or the work might be secret for some legitimate reason. It might be...\n The trouble was, he had to know. He couldn\u0027t leave things as they were now. He couldn\u0027t!\n He said, \"Is there a text on neutrinics, Uncle Ralph? I mean a clear and simple one. An elementary one.\"\n Nimmo thought, his plump cheeks puffing out with a series of sighs. \"You ask the damnedest questions. The only one I ever heard of was Sterbinski and somebody. I\u0027ve never seen it, but I viewed something about it once... Sterbinski and LaMarr, that\u0027s it.\"\n \"Is that the Sterbinski who invented the chronoscope?\" i \"I think so. Proves the book ought to be good.\" \u0026#8226; \"Is there a recent edition? Sterbinski died thirty years ago.\"\n Nimmo shrugged and said nothing.\n \"Can you find out?\"\n They sat in silence for a moment, while Nimmo shifted his bulk to the creaking tune of the chair he sat on. Then the science writer said, \"Are you going to tell me what this is all about?\"\n \"I can\u0027t. Will you help me anyway, Uncle Ralph? Will you get me a copy of the text?\"\n \"Well, you\u0027ve taught me all I know on pseudo-gravities. I should be grateful. Tell you what-I\u0027ll help you on one condition.\"\n \"Which is?\"\n The older man was suddenly very grave. \"That you be careful, Jonas. You\u0027re obviously way out of line whatever you\u0027re doing. Don\u0027t blow up your career just because you\u0027re curious about something you haven\u0027t been assigned to and which is none of your business. Understand?\"\n Foster nodded, but he hardly heard. He was thinking furiously.\n A full week later, Ralph Nimmo eased his rotund figure into Jonas Foster\u0027s on-campus two-room combination and said, in a hoarse whisper, \"I\u0027ve got something.\"\n \"What?\" Foster was immediately eager.\n \"A copy of Sterbinski and LaMarr.\" He produced it, or rather a corner of it, from his ample topcoat. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-3.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: \n Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
