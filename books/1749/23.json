But the torture is done and it\u0027s now for the fun and the paper that\u0027s white and the words that are right, for you\u0027ve worked up a new s.f. story. Dreaming Is a Private Thing Jesse Weill looked up from his desk. His old, spare body, his sharp, high-bridged nose, deep-set, shadowy eyes and amazing shock of white hair had trademarked his appearance during the years that Dreams, Inc., had become world-famous. He said, \"Is the boy here already, Joe?\" Joe Dooley was short and heavy-set. A cigar caressed his moist lower lip. He took it away for a moment and nodded. \"His folks are with him. They\u0027re all scared.\" \"You\u0027re sure this is not a false alarm, Joe? I haven\u0027t got much time.\" He looked at his watch. \"Government business at two.\" \"This is a sure thing, Mr. Weill.\" Dooley\u0027s face was a study in earnestness. His jowls quivered with persuasive intensity. \"Like I told you, I picked him up playing some kind of basketball game in the schoolyard. You should\u0027ve seen the kid. He stunk. When he had his hands on the ball, his own team had to take it away, and fast, but just the same he had all the stance of a star player. Know what I mean? To me it was a giveaway.\" \"Did you talk to him?\" \"Well, sure. I stopped him at lunch. You know me.\" Dooley gestured expansively with his cigar and caught the severed ash with his other hand. \"Kid, I said-\" \"And he\u0027s dream material?\" \"I said, \u0027Kid, I just came from Africa and-\u0027 \" \"All right.\" Weill held up the palm of his hand. \"Your word I\u0027ll always take. How you do it I don\u0027t know, but when you say a boy is a potential dreamer, I\u0027ll gamble. Bring him in.\" The youngster came in between his parents. Dooley pushed chairs forward and Weill rose to shake hands. He smiled at the youngster in a way that turned the wrinkles of his face into benevolent creases. \"You\u0027re Tommy Slutsky?\" Tommy nodded wordlessly. He was about ten and a little small for that. His dark hair was plastered down unconvincingly and his face was unrealistically clean. Weill said, \"You\u0027re a good boy?\" The boy\u0027s mother smiled at once and patted Tommy\u0027s head maternally (a gesture which did not soften the anxious expression on the youngster\u0027s face). She said, \"He\u0027s always a very good boy.\" Weill let this dubious statement pass. \"Tell me, Tommy,\" he said, and held out a lollipop which was first hesitated over, then accepted, \"do you ever listen to dreamies?\" \"Sometimes,\" said Tommy trebly. Mr. Slutsky cleared his throat. He was broad-shouldered and thick-fingered, the type of laboring man who, every once in a while, to the confusion of eugenics, sired a dreamer. \"We rented one or two for the boy. Real old ones.\" Weill nodded. He said, \"Did you like them, Tommy?\" \"They were sort of silly.\" \"You think up better ones for yourself, do you?\" The grin that spread over the ten-year-old face had the effect of taking away some of the unreality of the slicked hair and washed face. Weill went on gently, \"Would you like to make up a dream for me?\" Tommy was instantly embarrassed. \"I guess not.\" \"It won\u0027t be hard. It\u0027s very easy... Joe.\" Dooley moved a screen out of the way and rolled forward a dream recorder. The youngster looked owlishly at it. Weill lifted the helmet and brought it close to the boy. \"Do you know what this is?\" Tommy shrank away. \"No.\" \"It\u0027s a thinker. That\u0027s what we call it because people think into it. You put it on your head and think anything you want.\" \"Then what happens?\" \"Nothing at all. It feels nice.\" \"No,\" said Tommy, \"I guess I\u0027d rather not.\" His mother bent hurriedly toward him. \"It won\u0027t hurt, Tommy. You do what the man says.\" There was an unmistakable edge to her voice. Tommy stiffened, and looked as though he might cry but he didn\u0027t. Weill put the thinker on him. He did it gently and slowly and let it remain there for some thirty seconds before speaking again, to let the boy assure himself it would do no harm, to let him get used to the insinuating touch of the fibrils against the sutures of his skull (penetrating the skin so finely as to be insensible almost), and finally to let him get used to the faint hum of the alternating field vortices. Then he said, \"Now would you think for us?\" \"About what?\" Only the boy\u0027s nose and mouth showed. \"About anything you want. What\u0027s the best thing you would like to do when school is out?\" The boy thought a moment and said, with rising inflection, \"Go on a stratojet?\" \"Why not? Sure thing. You go on a jet. It\u0027s taking off right now.\" He gestured lightly to Dooley, who threw the freezer into circuit. Weill kept the boy only five minutes and then let him and his mother be escorted from the office by Dooley. Tommy looked bewildered but undamaged by the ordeal. Weill said to the father, \"Now, Mr. Slutsky, if your boy does well on this test, we\u0027ll be glad to pay you five hundred dollars each year until he finishes high school. In that time, all we\u0027ll ask is that he spend an hour a week some afternoon at our special school.\" \"Do I have to sign a paper?\" Slutsky\u0027s voice was a bit hoarse. \"Certainly. This is business, Mr. Slutsky.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know. Dreamers are hard to come by, I hear.\" \"They are. They are. But your son, Mr. Slutsky, is not a dreamer yet. He might never be. Five hundred dollars a year is a gamble for us. It\u0027s not a gamble for you. When he\u0027s finished high school, it may turn out he\u0027s not a dreamer, yet you\u0027ve lost nothing. You\u0027ve gained maybe four thousand dollars altogether. If he is a dreamer, he\u0027ll make a nice living and you certainly haven\u0027t lost then.\" \"He\u0027ll need special training, won\u0027t he?\" \"Oh, yes, most intensive. But we don\u0027t have to worry about that till after he\u0027s finished high school. Then, after two years with us, he\u0027ll be developed. Rely on me, Mr. Slutsky.\" \"Will you guarantee that special training?\" Weill, who had been shoving a paper across the desk at Slutsky, and punching a pen wrong-end-to at him, put the pen down and chuckled. \"A guarantee? No. How can we when we don\u0027t know for sure yet if he\u0027s a real talent? Still, the five hundred a year will stay yours.\" Slutsky pondered and shook his head. \"I tell you straight out, Mr. Weill... After your man arranged to have us come here, I called Luster-Think. They said they\u0027ll guarantee training.\" Weill sighed. \"Mr. Slutsky, I don\u0027t like to talk against a competitor. If they say they\u0027ll guarantee schooling, they\u0027ll do as they say, but they can\u0027t make a boy a dreamer if he hasn\u0027t got it in him, schooling or not. If they take a plain boy without the proper talent and put him through a development course, they\u0027ll ruin him. A dreamer he won\u0027t be, I guarantee you. And a normal human being, he won\u0027t be, either. Don\u0027t take the chance of doing it: to your son. \"Now Dreams, Inc., will be perfectly honest with you. If he can be a dreamer, we\u0027ll make him one. If not, we\u0027ll give him back to you without having tampered with him and say, \u0027Let him learn a trade.\u0027 He\u0027ll be better and healthier that way. I tell you, Mr. Slutsky-I have sons and daughters and grandchildren so I know what I say-I would not allow a child of mine to be pushed into dreaming if he\u0027s not ready for it. Not for a million dollars.\" Slutsky wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and reached for the P*n. \"What does this say?\" \"This is just an option. We pay you a hundred dollars in cash right now. No strings attached. We study the boy\u0027s reverie. If we feel it\u0027s worth following up, we\u0027ll call you in again and make the five-hundred-dollar-a-year deal. Leave yourself in my hands, Mr. Slutsky, and don\u0027t worry. You won\u0027t be Sorry.\" Slutsky signed. Weill passed the document through the file slot and handed an envelope to Slutsky. Five minutes later, alone in the office, he placed the unfreezer over his own head and absorbed the boy\u0027s reverie intently. It was a typically childish (Saydream. First Person was at the controls of the plane, which looked like a Compound of illustrations out of the filmed thrillers that still circulated among those who lacked the time, desire or money for dream cylinders. When he removed the unfreezer, he found Dooley looking at him. \"Well, Mr. Weill, what do you think?\" said Dooley, with an eager and proprietary air. \"Could be, Joe. Could be. He has the overtones and, for a ten-year-old boy without a scrap of training, it\u0027s hopeful. When the plane went through a cloud, there was a distinct sensation of pillows. Also the smell of clean Sheets, which was an amusing touch. We can go with him a ways, Joe.\" \"Good.\" \"But I tell you, Joe, what we really need is to catch them still sooner. And why not? Someday, Joe, every child will be tested at birth. A difference in the brain there positively must be and it should be found. Then we could Separate the dreamers at the very beginning.\" \"Hell, Mr. Weill,\" said Dooley, looking hurt. \"What would happen to my job, then?\" Weill laughed. \"No cause to worry yet, Joe. It won\u0027t happen in our life-times. In mine, certainly not. We\u0027ll be depending on good talent scouts like you for many years. You just watch the playgrounds and the streets\"- Weill\u0027s gnarled hand dropped to Dooley\u0027s shoulder with a gentle, approving pressure-\"and find us a few more Hillarys and Janows and Luster-Think won\u0027t ever catch us... Now get out. I want lunch and then I\u0027ll be ready for my two o\u0027clock appointment. The government, Joe, the government.\" And he winked portentously. Jesse Weill\u0027s two o\u0027clock appointment was with a young man, apple-cheeked, spectacled, sandy-haired and glowing with the intensity of a man with a mission. He presented his credentials across Weill\u0027s desk and revealed himself to be John J. Byrne, an agent of the Department of Arts and Sciences. \"Good afternoon, Mr. Byrne,\" said Weill. \"In what way can I be of service?\" \"Are we private here?\" asked the agent. He had an unexpected baritone. \"Quite private.\" \"Then, if you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027ll ask you to absorb this.\" Byrne produced a small and battered cylinder and held it out between thumb and forefinger. Weill took it, hefted it, turned it this way and that and said with a denture-revealing smile, \"Not the product of Dreams, Inc., Mr. Byrne.\" \"I didn\u0027t think it was,\" said the agent. \"I\u0027d still like you to absorb it. I\u0027d set the automatic cutoff for about a minute, though.\" \"That\u0027s all that can be endured?\" Weill pulled the receiver to his desk and placed the cylinder into the unfreeze compartment. He removed it, polished either end of the cylinder with his handkerchief and tried again. \"It doesn\u0027t make good contact,\" he said. \"An amateurish job.\" He placed the cushioned unfreeze helmet over his skull and adjusted the temple contacts, then set the automatic cutoff. He leaned back and clasped his hands over his chest and began absorbing. His fingers grew rigid and clutched at his jacket. After the cutoff had brought absorption to an end, he removed the unfreezer and looked faintly angry. \"A raw piece,\" he said. \"It\u0027s lucky I\u0027m an old man so that such things no longer bother me.\" Byrne said stiffly, \"It\u0027s not the worst we\u0027ve found. And the fad is increasing.\" Weill shrugged. \"Pornographic dreamies. It\u0027s a logical development, I suppose.\" The government man said, \"Logical or not, it represents a deadly danger for the moral fiber of the nation.\" \"The moral fiber,\" said Weill, \"can take a lot of beating. Erotica of one form or another have been circulated all through history.\" \"Not like this, sir. A direct mind-to-mind stimulation is much more effective than smoking room stories or filthy pictures. Those must be filtered through the senses and lose some of their effect in that way.\" Weill could scarcely argue that point. He said, \"What would you have me do?\" \"Can you suggest a possible source for this cylinder?\" \"Mr. Byrne, I\u0027m not a policeman.\" \"No, no, I\u0027m not asking you to do our work for us. The Department is quite capable of conducting its own investigations. Can you help us, I mean, from your own specialized knowledge? You say your company did not put out that filth. Who did?\" \"No reputable dream distributor. I\u0027m sure of that. It\u0027s too cheaply made.\" \"That could have been done on purpose.\" \"And no professional dreamer originated it.\" \"Are you sure, Mr. Weill? Couldn\u0027t dreamers do this sort of thing for some small, illegitimate concern for money-or for fun?\" \"They could, but not this particular one. No overtones. It\u0027s two-dimensional. Of course, a thing like this doesn\u0027t need overtones.\" \"What do you mean, overtones?\" Weill laughed gently. \"You are not a dreamie fan?\" Byrne tried not to look virtuous and did not entirely succeed. \"I prefer music.\" \"Well, that\u0027s all right, too,\" said Weill tolerantly, \"but it makes it a little harder to explain overtones. Even people who absorb dreamies would not be able to explain if you asked them. Still they\u0027d know a dreamie was no good if the overtones were missing, even if they couldn\u0027t tell you why. Look, when an experienced dreamer goes into reverie, he doesn\u0027t think a story like in the old-fashioned television or book films. It\u0027s a series of little visions. Each one has several meanings. If you studied them carefully, you\u0027d find maybe five or six. While absorbing in the ordinary way, you would never notice, but careful study shows it. Believe me, my psychological staff puts in long hours on just that point. All the overtones, the different meanings, blend together into a mass of guided emotion. Without them, everything would be flat, tasteless. \"Now, this morning, I tested a young boy. A ten-year-old with possibilities. A cloud to him isn\u0027t a cloud, it\u0027s a pillow, too. Having the sensations of both, it was more than either. Of course, the boy\u0027s very primitive. But when he\u0027s through with his schooling, he\u0027ll be trained and disciplined. He\u0027ll be subjected to all sorts of sensations. He\u0027ll store up experience. He\u0027ll study and analyze classic dreamies of the past. He\u0027ll learn how to control and direct his thoughts, though, mind you, I have always said that when a good dreamer improvises-\" Weill halted abruptly, then proceeded in less impassioned tones, \"I shouldn\u0027t get excited. All I try to bring out now is that every professional dreamer has his own type of overtones which he can\u0027t mask. To an expert it\u0027s like signing his name on the dreamie. And I, Mr. Byrne, know all the signatures. Now that piece of dirt you brought me has no overtones at all. It was done by an ordinary person. A little talent, maybe, but like you and me, he really can\u0027t think.\" Byrne reddened a trifle. \"A lot of people can think, Mr. Weill, even if they don\u0027t make dreamies.\" \"Oh, tush,\" and Weill wagged his hand in the air. \"Don\u0027t be angry with what an old man says. I don\u0027t mean think as in reason. I mean think as in dream. We all can dream after a fashion, just like we all can run. But can you and I run a mile in four minutes? You and I can talk, but are we Daniel Websters? Now when I think of a steak, I think of the word. Maybe I have a quick picture of a brown steak on a platter. Maybe you have a better pictorialization of it and you can see the crisp fat and the onions and the baked potato. I don\u0027t know. But a dreamer... He sees it and smells it and tastes it and everything about it, with the charcoal and the satisfied feeling in the stomach and the way the knife cuts through it and a hundred other things all at once. Very sensual. Very sensual. You and I can\u0027t do it.\" \"Well, then,\" said Byrne, \"no professional dreamer has done this. That\u0027s something anyway.\" He put the cylinder in his inner jacket pocket. \"I hope we\u0027ll have your full cooperation in squelching this sort of thing.\" \"Positively, Mr. Byrne. With a whole heart.\" \"I hope so.\" Byrne spoke with a consciousness of power. \"It\u0027s not up to me, Mr. Weill, to say what will be done and what won\u0027t be done, but this sort of thing,\" he tapped the cylinder he had brought, \"will make it awfully tempting to impose a really strict censorship on dreamies.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-23.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
