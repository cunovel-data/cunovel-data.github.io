{"id":71107,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"So the same fire that had driven him on to causing the construction of a chronoscope was now driving him on to the destruction.\\n\\n Foster looked sadly at the older man. \"I see your position, Dr. Potterley, but this goes above personal feelings. I\u0027ve got to smash this throttling hold on the throat of science.\"\\n\\n Potterley said, savagely, \"You mean you want the fame and wealth that goes with such a discovery.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know about the wealth, but that, too, I suppose. I\u0027m no more than human.\"\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t suppress your knowledge?\"\\n\\n \"Not under any circumstances.\"\\n\\n \"Well, then-\" and the historian got to his feet and stood for a moment, glaring.\\n\\n Foster had an odd moment of terror. The man was older than he, smaller, feebler, and he didn\u0027t look armed. Still...\\n\\n Foster said, \"If you\u0027re thinking of killing me or anything insane like that, I\u0027ve got the information in a safety-deposit vault where the proper people will find it in case of my disappearance or death.\"\\n\\n Potterley said, \"Don\u0027t be a fool,\" and stalked out.\\n\\n Foster closed the door, locked it and sat down to think. He felt silly. He had no information in any safety-deposit vault, of course. Such a melodramatic action would not have occurred to him ordinarily. But now it had.\\n\\n Feeling even sillier, he spent an hour writing out the equations of the application of pseudo-gravitic optics to neutrinic recording, and some diagrams for the engineering details of construction. He sealed it in an envelope and scrawled Ralph Nimmo\u0027s name over the outside.\\n\\n He spent a rather restless night and the next morning, on the way to school, dropped the envelope off at the bank, with appropriate instructions to an official, who made him sign a paper permitting the box to be opened after his death.\\n\\n He called Nimmo to tell him of the existence of the envelope, refusing querulously to say anything about its contents.\\n\\n He had never felt so ridiculously self-conscious as at that moment.\\n\\n That night and the next, Foster spent in only fitful sleep, finding himself face to face with the highly practical problem of the publication of data unethically obtained.\\n\\n The Proceedings of the Society for Pseudo-Gravities, which was the journal with which he was best acquainted, would certainly not touch any paper that did not include the magic footnote: \"The work described in this paper was made possible by Grant No. so-and-so from the Commission of Research of the United Nations.\"\\n\\n Nor, doubly so, would the Journal of Physics.\\n\\n There were always the minor journals who might overlook the nature of the article for the sake of the sensation, but that would require a little financial negotiation on which he hesitated to embark. It might, on the whole, be better to pay the cost of publishing a small pamphlet for general distribution among scholars. In that case, he would even be able to dispense with the services of a science writer, sacrificing polish for speed. He would have to find a reliable printer. Uncle Ralph might know one.\\n\\n He walked down the corridor to his office and wondered anxiously if perhaps he ought to waste no further time, give himself no further chance to lapse into indecision and take the risk of calling Ralph from his office phone. He was so absorbed in his own heavy thoughts that he did not notice that his room was occupied until he turned from the clothes closet and approached his desk.\\n\\n Dr. Potterley was there and a man whom Foster did not recognize.\\n\\n Foster stared at them. \"What\u0027s this?\"\\n\\n Potterley said, \"I\u0027m sorry, but I had to stop you.\"\\n\\n Foster continued staring. \"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n The stranger said, \"Let me introduce myself.\" He had large teeth, a little uneven, and they showed prominently when he smiled. \"I am Thaddeus Araman, Department Head of the Division of Chronoscopy. I am here to see you concerning information brought to me by Professor Arnold Potterley and confirmed by our own sources-\"\\n\\n Potterley said breathlessly, \"I took all the blame, Dr. Foster. I explained that it was I who persuaded you against your will into unethical practices. I have offered to accept full responsibility and punishment. I don\u0027t wish you harmed in any way. It\u0027s just that chronoscopy must not be permitted!\"\\n\\n Araman nodded. \"He has taken the blame as he says, Dr. Foster, but this thing is out of his hands now.\"\\n\\n Foster said, \"So? What are you going to do? Blackball me from all consideration for research grants?\"\\n\\n \"That is in my power,\" said Araman.\\n\\n \"Order the university to discharge me?\"\\n\\n \"That, too, is in my power.\"\\n\\n \"All right, go ahead. Consider it done. I\u0027ll leave my office now, with you. I can send for my books later. If you insist, I\u0027ll leave my books. Is that all?\"\\n\\n \"Not quite,\" said Araman. \"You must engage to do no further research in chronoscopy, to publish none of your findings in chronoscopy and, of course, to build no chronoscope. You will remain under surveillance indefinitely to make sure you keep that promise.\"\\n\\n \"Supposing I refuse to promise? What can you do? Doing research out of my field may be unethical, but it isn\u0027t a criminal offense.\"\\n\\n \"In the case of chronoscopy, my young friend,\" said Araman patiently, \"it is a criminal offense. If necessary, you will be put in jail and kept there.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" shouted Foster. \"What\u0027s magic about chronoscopy?\"\\n\\n Araman said, \"That\u0027s the way it is. We cannot allow further developments in the field. My own job is, primarily, to make sure of that, and I intend to do my job. Unfortunately, I had no knowledge, nor did anyone in the department, that the optics of pseudo-gravity fields had such immediate application to chronoscopy. Score one for general ignorance, but henceforward research will be steered properly in that respect, too.\"\\n\\n Foster said, \"That won\u0027t help. Something else may apply that neither you nor I dream of. All science hangs together. It\u0027s one piece. If you want to stop one part, you\u0027ve got to stop it all.\"\\n\\n \"No doubt that is true,\" said Araman, \"in theory. On the practical side, however, we have managed quite well to hold chronoscopy down to the original Sterbinski level for fifty years. Having caught you in time, Dr. Foster, we hope to continue doing so indefinitely. And we wouldn\u0027t have come this close to disaster, either, if I had accepted Dr. Potterley at something more than face value.\"\\n\\n He turned toward the historian and lifted his eyebrows in a kind of humorous self-deprecation. \"I\u0027m afraid, sir, that I dismissed you as a history professor and no more on the occasion of our first interview. Had I done my job properly and checked on you, this would not have happened.\"\\n\\n Foster said abruptly, \"Is anyone allowed to use the government chrono-scope?\"\\n\\n \"No one outside our division under any pretext. I say that since it is obvious to me that you have already guessed as much. I warn you, though, that any repetition of that fact will be a criminal, not an ethical, offense.\"\\n\\n \"And your chronoscope doesn\u0027t go back more than a hundred twenty-five years or so, does it?\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Then your bulletin with its stories of time viewing ancient times is a hoax?\"\\n\\n Araman said coolly, \"With the knowledge you now have, it is obvious you know that for a certainty. However, I confirm your remark. The monthly bulletin is a hoax.\"\\n\\n \"In that case,\" said Foster, \"I will not promise to suppress my knowledge of chronoscopy. If you wish to arrest me, go ahead. My defense at the trial will be enough to destroy the vicious card house of directed research and bring it tumbling down. Directing research is one thing; suppressing it and depriving mankind of its benefits is quite another.\"\\n\\n Araman said, \"Oh, let\u0027s get something straight, Dr. Foster. If you do not co-operate, you will go to jail directly. You will not see a lawyer, you will not be charged, you will not have a trial. You will simply stay in jail.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no,\" said Foster, \"you\u0027re bluffing. This is not the twentieth century, you know.\"\\n\\n There was a stir outside the office, the clatter of feet, a high-pitched shout that Foster was sure he recognized. The door crashed open, the lock splintering, and three intertwined figures stumbled in.\\n\\n As they did so, one of the men raised a blaster and brought its butt down hard on the skull of another.\\n\\n There was a whoosh of expiring air, and the one whose head was struck went limp.\\n\\n \"Uncle Ralph!\" cried Foster.\\n\\n Araman frowned. \"Put him down in that chair,\" he ordered, \"and get some water.\"\\n\\n Ralph Nimmo, rubbing his head with a gingerly sort of disgust, said, \"There was no need to get rough, Araman.\"\\n\\n Araman said, \"The guard should have been rough sooner and kept you out of here, Nimmo. You\u0027d have been better off.\"\\n\\n \"You know each other?\" asked Foster.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve had dealings with the man,\" said Nimmo, still rubbing. \"If he\u0027s here in your office, nephew, you\u0027re in trouble.\"\\n\\n \"And you, too,\" said Araman angrily. \"I know Dr. Foster consulted you on neutrinics literature.\"\\n\\n Nimmo corrugated his forehead, then straightened it with a wince as though the action had brought pain. \"So?\" he said. \"What else do you know about me?\"\\n\\n \"We will know everything about you soon enough. Meanwhile, that one item is enough to implicate you. What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n \"My dear Dr. Araman,\" said Nimmo, some of his jauntiness restored, \"day before yesterday, my jackass of a nephew called me. He had placed some mysterious information-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell him! Don\u0027t say anything!\" cried Foster.\\n\\n Araman gknced at him coldly. \"We know all about it, Dr. Foster. The safety-deposit box has been opened and its contents removed.\"\\n\\n \"But how can you know-\" Foster\u0027s voice died away in a kind of furious frustration.\\n\\n \"Anyway,\" said Nimmo, \"I decided the net must be closing around him and, after I took care of a few items, I came down to tell him to get off this thing he\u0027s doing. It\u0027s not worth his career.\"\\n\\n \"Does that mean you know what he\u0027s doing?\" asked Araman.\\n\\n \"He never told me,\" said Nimmo, \"but I\u0027m a science writer with a hell of a lot of experience. I know which side of an atom is electronified. The boy, Foster, specializes in pseudo-gravitic optics and coached me on the stuff himself. He got me to get him a textbook on neutrinics and I kind of ship-viewed it myself before handing it over. I can put the two together. He asked me to get him certain pieces of physical equipment, and that was evidence, too. Stop me if I\u0027m wrong, but my nephew has built a semiportable, low-power chronoscope. Yes, or-yes?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Araman reached thoughtfully for a cigarette and paid no attention to Dr. Potterley (watching silently, as though all were a dream) who shied away, gasping, from the white cylinder. \"Another mistake for me. I ought to resign. I should have put tabs on you, too, Nimmo, instead of concentrating too hard on Potterley and Foster. I didn\u0027t have much time of course and you\u0027ve ended up safely here, but that doesn\u0027t excuse me. You\u0027re under arrest, Nimmo.\"\\n\\n \"What for?\" demanded the science writer.\\n\\n \"Unauthorized research.\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t doing any. I can\u0027t, not being a registered scientist. And even if I did, it\u0027s not a criminal offense.\"\\n\\n Foster said savagely, \"No use, Uncle Ralph. This bureaucrat is making his own laws.\"\\n\\n \"Like what?\" demanded Nimmo.\\n\\n \"Like life imprisonment without trial.\"\\n\\n \"Nuts,\" said Nimmo. \"This isn\u0027t the twentieth cen-\"\\n\\n \"I tried that,\" said Foster. \"It doesn\u0027t bother him.\"\\n\\n \"Well, nuts,\" shouted Nimmo. \"Look here, Araman. My nephew and I have relatives who haven\u0027t lost touch with us, you know. The professor has some also, I imagine. You can\u0027t just make us disappear. There\u0027ll be questions and a scandal. This isn\u0027t the twentieth century. So if you\u0027re trying to scare us, it isn\u0027t working.\"\\n\\n The cigarette snapped between Araman\u0027s fingers and he tossed it away violently. He said, \"Damn it, I don\u0027t know what to do. It\u0027s never been like this before... Look! You three fools know nothing of what you\u0027re trying to do. You understand nothing. Will you listen to me?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, we\u0027ll listen,\" said Nimmo grimly.\\n\\n (Foster sat silently, eyes angry, lips compressed. Potterley\u0027s hands writhed like two intertwined snakes.)\\n\\n Araman said, \"The past to you is the dead past. If any of you have discussed the matter, it\u0027s dollars to nickels you\u0027ve used that phrase. The dead past. If you knew how many times I\u0027ve heard those three words, you\u0027d choke on them, too.\\n\\n \"When people think of the past, they think of it as dead, far away and gone, long ago. We encourage them to think so. When we report time viewing, we always talk of views centuries in the past, even though you gentlemen know seeing more than a century or so is impossible. People accept it. The past means Greece, Rome, Carthage, Egypt, the Stone Age. The deader the better.\\n\\n \"Now you three know a century or a little more is the limit, so what does the past mean to you? Your youth. Your first girl. Your dead mother. Twenty years ago. Thirty years ago. Fifty years ago. The deader the better... But when does the past really begin?\"\\n\\n He paused in anger. The others stared at him and Nimmo stirred uneasily.\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Araman, \"when did it begin? A year ago? Five minutes ago? One second ago? Isn\u0027t it obvious that the past begins an instant ago? The dead past is just another name for the living present. What if you focus the chronoscope in the past of one-hundredth of a second ago? Aren\u0027t you watching the present? Does it begin to sink in?\"\\n\\n Nimmo said, \"Damnation.\"\\n\\n \"Damnation,\" mimicked Araman. \"After Potterley came to me with his story night before last, how do you suppose I checked up on both of you? I did it with the chronoscope, spotting key moments to the very instant of the present.\"\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s how you knew about the safety-deposit box?\" said Foster.\\n\\n \"And every other important fact. Now what do you suppose would happen if we let news of a home chronoscope get out? People might start out by watching their youth, their parents and so on, but it wouldn\u0027t be long before they\u0027d catch on to the possibilities. The housewife will forget her poor, dead mother and take to watching her neighbor at home and her husband at the office. The businessman will watch his competitor; the employer his employee.\\n\\n \"There will be no such thing as privacy. The party line, the prying eye behind the curtain will be nothing compared to it. The video stars will be closely watched at all times by everyone. Every man his own peeping Tom and there\u0027ll be no getting away from the watcher. Even darkness will be no escape because chronoscopy can be adjusted to the infrared and human figures can be seen by their own body heat. The figures will be fuzzy, of course, and the surroundings will be dark, but that will make the titillation of it all the greater, perhaps... Hmp, the men in charge of the machine now experiment sometimes in spite of the regulations against it.\"\\n\\n Nimmo seemed sick. \"You can always forbid private manufacture-\"\\n\\n Araman turned on him fiercely. \"You can, but do you expect it to do good? Can you legislate successfully against drinking, smoking, adultery or gossiping over the back fence? And this mixture of nosiness and prurience will have a worse grip on humanity than any of those. Good Lord, in a thousand years of trying we haven\u0027t even been able to wipe out the heroin traffic and you talk about legislating against a device for watching anyone you please at any time you please that can be built in a home workshop.\"\\n\\n Foster said suddenly, \"I won\u0027t publish.\"\\n\\n Potterley burst out, half in sobs, \"None of us will talk. I regret-\"\\n\\n Nimmo broke in. \"You said you didn\u0027t tab me on the chronoscope, Araman.\"\\n\\n \"No time,\" said Araman wearily. \"Things don\u0027t move any faster on the chronoscope than in real life. You can\u0027t speed it up like the film in a book viewer. We spent a full twenty-four hours trying to catch the important moments during the last six months of Potterley and Foster. There was no time for anything else and it was enough.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-6.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
