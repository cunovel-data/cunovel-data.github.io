{"id":71116,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"She did, and it struck her at once. \"Have you been polishing the furniture?\"\\n\\n \"Is it satisfactory, Mrs. Belmont?\"\\n\\n \"But when? You didn\u0027t do it yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"Last night, of course.\"\\n\\n \"You burned the lights all night?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no. That wouldn\u0027t have been necessary. I\u0027ve a built-in ultra-violet source. I can see in ultraviolet. And, of course, I don\u0027t require sleep.\"\\n\\n He did require admiration, though. She realized that, then. He had to know that he was pleasing her. But she couldn\u0027t bring herself to supply that pleasure for him.\\n\\n She could only say sourly, \"Your kind will put ordinary houseworkers out of business.\"\\n\\n \"There is work of much greater importance they can be put to in the world, once they are freed of drudgery. After all, Mrs. Belmont, things like myself can be manufactured. But nothing yet can imitate the creativity and versatility of a human brain, like yours.\"\\n\\n And though his face gave no hint, his voice was warmly surcharged with awe and admiration, so that Claire flushed and muttered, \"My brain! You can have it.\"\\n\\n Tony approached a little and said, \"You must be unhappy to say such a thing. Is there anything I can do?\"\\n\\n For a moment, Claire felt like laughing. It was a ridiculous situation. Here was an animated carpet-sweeper, dishwasher, furniture-polisher, general factotum, rising from the factory table-and offering his services as consoler and confidant.\\n\\n Yet she said suddenly, in a burst of woe and voice, \"Mr. Belmont doesn\u0027t think I have a brain, if you must know... And I suppose I haven\u0027t.\" She couldn\u0027t cry in front of him. She felt, for some reason, that she had the honor of the human race to support against this mere creation.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s lately,\" she added. \"It was all right when he was a student; when he was just starting. But I can\u0027t be a big man\u0027s wife; and he\u0027s getting to be a big man. He wants me to be a hostess and an entry into social life for him-like G-guh-guh-Gladys Claffern.\"\\n\\n Her nose was red, and she looked away.\\n\\n But Tony wasn\u0027t watching her. His eyes wandered about the room. \"I can help you run the house.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s no good,\" she said fiercely. \"It needs a touch I can\u0027t give it. I can only make it comfortable; I can\u0027t ever make it the kind they take pictures of for the Home Beautiful magazines.\"\\n\\n \"Do you want that kind?\"\\n\\n \"Does it do any good-wanting?\"\\n\\n Tony\u0027s eyes were on her, full. \"I could help.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know anything about interior decoration?\"\\n\\n \"Is it something a good housekeeper should know?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Then I have the potentialities of learning it. Can you get me books on the subject?\"\\n\\n Something started then.\\n\\n Claire, clutching her hat against the brawling liberties of the wind, had manipulated two fat volumes on the home arts back from the public library. She watched Tony as he opened one of them and flipped the pages. It was the first time she had watched his fingers flicker at anything like fine work.\\n\\n I don\u0027t see how they do it, she thought, and on a sudden impulse reached for his hand and pulled it toward herself. Tony did not resist, but let it lie limp for inspection.\\n\\n She said, \"It\u0027s remarkable. Even your fingernails look natural.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s deliberate, of course,\" said Tony. Then, chattily, \"The skin is a flexible plastic, and the skeletal framework is a light metal alloy. Does that amuse you?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no.\" She lifted her reddened face. \"I just feel a little embarrassed at sort of poking into your insides. It\u0027s none of my business. You don\u0027t ask me about mine.\"\\n\\n \"My brain paths don\u0027t include that type of curiosity. I can only act within my limitations, you know.\"\\n\\n And Claire felt something tighten inside her in the silence that followed. Why did she keep forgetting he was a machine. Now the thing itself had to remind her. Was she so starved for sympathy that she would even accept a robot as equal-because he sympathized?\\n\\n She noticed Tony was still flipping the pages-almost helplessly-and there was a quick, shooting sense of relieved superiority within her. \"You can\u0027t read, can you?\"\\n\\n Tony looked up at her; his voice calm, unreproachful. \"I am reading, Mrs. Belmont.\"\\n\\n \"But-\" She pointed at the book in a meaningless gesture.\\n\\n \"I am scanning the pages, if that\u0027s what you mean. My sense of reading is photographic.\"\\n\\n It was evening then, and when Claire eventually went to bed Tony was well into the second volume, sitting there in the dark, or what seemed dark to Claire\u0027s limited eyes.\\n\\n Her last thought, the one that clamored at her just as her mind let go and tumbled, was a queer one. She remembered his hand again; the touch of it. It had been warm and soft, like a human being\u0027s.\\n\\n How clever of the factory, she thought, and softly ebbed to sleep.\\n\\n It was the library continuously, thereafter, for several days. Tony suggested the fields of study, which branched out quickly. There were books on color matching and on cosmetics; on carpentry and on fashions; on art and on the history of costumes.\\n\\n He turned the pages of each book before his solemn eyes, and, as quickly as he turned, he read; nor did he seem capable of forgetting.\\n\\n Before the end of the week, he had insisted on cutting her hair, introducing her to a new method of arranging it, adjusting her eyebrow line a bit and changing the shade of her powder and lipstick.\\n\\n She had palpitated in nervous dread for half an hour under the delicate touch of his inhuman fingers and then looked in the mirror.\\n\\n \"There is more that can be done,\" said Tony, \"especially in clothes. How do you find it for a beginning?\"\\n\\n And she hadn\u0027t answered; not for quite a while. Not until she had absorbed the identity of the stranger in the glass and cooled the wonder at the beauty of it all. Then she had said chokingly, never once taking her eyes from the warming image, \"Yes, Tony, quite good-for a beginning.\"\\n\\n She said nothing of this in her letters to Larry. Let him see it all at once. And something in her realized that it wasn\u0027t only the surprise she would enjoy. It was going to be a kind of revenge.\\n\\n Tony said one morning, \"It\u0027s time to start buying, and I\u0027m not allowed to leave the house. If I write out exactly what we must have, can I trust you to get it? We need drapery, and furniture fabric, wallpaper, carpeting, paint, clothing-and any number of small things.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t get these things to your own specifications at a stroke\u0027s notice,\" said Claire doubtfully.\\n\\n \"You can get fairly close, if you go through the city and if money is no object.\"\\n\\n \"But, Tony, money is certainly an object.\"\\n\\n \"Not at all. Stop off at U.S. Robots in the first place. I\u0027ll write a note for you. You see Dr. Calvin, and tell her that I said it was part of the experiment.\"\\n\\n Dr. Calvin, somehow, didn\u0027t frighten her as on that first evening. With her new face and a new hat, she couldn\u0027t be quite the old Claire. The psychologist listened carefully, asked a few questions, nodded-and then Claire found herself walking out, armed with an unlimited charge account against the assets of U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men Corporation.\\n\\n It is wonderful what money will do. With a store\u0027s contents at her feet, a saleslady\u0027s dictum was not necessarily a voice from above; the uplifted eyebrow of a decorator was not anything like Jove\u0027s thunder.\\n\\n And once, when an Exalted Plumpness at one of the most lordly of the garment salons had insistently poohed her description of the wardrobe she must have with counterpronouncements in accents of the purest Fifty-seventh Street French, she called up Tony, then held the phone out to Monsieur.\\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t mind\"-voice firm, but fingers twisting a bit-\"I\u0027d like you to talk to my-uh-secretary.\"\\n\\n Pudgy proceeded to the phone with a solemn arm crooked behind his back. He lifted the phone in two fingers and said delicately, \"Yes.\" A short pause, another \"Yes,\" then a much longer pause, a squeaky beginning of an objection that perished quickly, another pause, a very meek \"Yes,\" and the phone was restored to its cradle.\\n\\n \"If Madam will come with me,\" he said, hurt and distant, \"I will try to supply her needs.\"\\n\\n \"Just a second.\" Claire rushed back to the phone, and dialed again. \"Hello, Tony. I don\u0027t know what you said, but it worked. Thanks. You\u0027re a-\" She struggled for the appropriate word, gave up and ended in a final little squeak, \"-a-a dear!\"\\n\\n It was Gladys Claffern looking at her when she turned from the phone again. A slightly amused and slightly amazed Gladys Claffern, looking at her out of a face tilted a bit to one side.\\n\\n \"Mrs. Belmont?\"\\n\\n It all drained out of Claire-just like that. She could only nod-stupidly, like a marionette.\\n\\n Gladys smiled with an insolence you couldn\u0027t put your finger on. \"I didn\u0027t know you shopped here?\" As if the place had, in her eyes, definitely lost caste through the fact.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t, usually,\" said Claire humbly.\\n\\n \"And haven\u0027t you done something to your hair? It\u0027s quite-quaint... Oh, I hope you\u0027ll excuse me, but isn\u0027t your husband\u0027s name Lawrence? It seems to me that it\u0027s Lawrence.\"\\n\\n Claire\u0027s teeth clenched, but she had to explain. She had to. \"Tony is a friend of my husband\u0027s. He\u0027s helping me select some things.\"\\n\\n \"I understand. And quite a dear about it, I imagine.\" She passed on smiling, carrying the light and the warmth of the world with her.\\n\\n Claire did not question the fact that it was to Tony that she turned for consolation. Ten days had cured her of reluctance. And she could weep before him; weep and rage.\\n\\n \"I was a complete f-fool,\" she stormed, wrenching at her water-togged handkerchief. \"She does that to me. I don\u0027t know why. She just does. I should have-kicked her. I should have knocked her down and stamped on her.\"\\n\\n \"Can you hate a human being so much?\" asked Tony, in puzzled softness. \"That part of a human mind is closed to me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, it isn\u0027t she,\" she moaned. \"It\u0027s myself, I suppose. She\u0027s everything I want to be-on the outside, anyway... And I can\u0027t be.\"\\n\\n Tony\u0027s voice was forceful and low in her ear. \"You can be, Mrs. Belmont. You can be. We have ten days yet, and in ten days the house will no longer be itself. Haven\u0027t we been planning that?\"\\n\\n \"And how will that help me-with her?\"\\n\\n \"Invite her here. Invite her friends. Have it the evening before I-before I leave. It will be a housewarming, in a way.\"\\n\\n \"She won\u0027t come.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, she will. She\u0027ll come to laugh... And she won\u0027t be able to.\"\\n\\n \"Do you really think so? Oh, Tony, do you think we can do it?\" She had both his hands in hers... And then, with her face flung aside, \"But what good would it be? It won\u0027t be I; it will be you that\u0027s doing it. I can\u0027t ride your back.\"\\n\\n \"Nobody lives in splendid singleness,\" whispered Tony. \"They\u0027ve put that knowledge in me. What you, or anyone, see in Gladys Claffern is not just Gladys Claffern. She rides the back of all that money and social position can bring. She doesn\u0027t question that. Why should you?... And look at it this way, Mrs. Belmont. I am manufactured to obey, but the extent of my obedience is for myself to determine. I can follow orders niggardly or liberally. For you, it is liberal, because you are what I have been manufactured to see human beings as. You are kind, friendly, unassuming. Mrs. Claffern, as you describe her, is not, and I wouldn\u0027t obey her as I would you. So it is you, and not I, Mrs. Belmont, that is doing all this.\"\\n\\n He withdrew his hands from hers then, and Claire looked at that expressionless face no one could read-wondering. She was suddenly frightened \u0027 again in a completely new way.\\n\\n She swallowed nervously and stared at her hands, which were still tingling \u0027 with the pressure of his fingers. She hadn\u0027t imagined it; his fingers had pressed hers, gently, tenderly, just before they moved away.\\n\\n No!\\n\\n Its fingers... Its fingers...\\n\\n She ran to the bathroom and scrubbed her hands-blindly, uselessly.\\n\\n She was a bit shy of him the next day; watching him narrowly; waiting to see what might follow-and for a while nothing did.\\n\\n Tony was working. If there was any difficulty in technique in putting up wallpaper, or utilizing the quick-drying paint, Tony\u0027s activity did not show it. His hands moved precisely; his fingers were deft and sure.\\n\\n He worked all night. She never heard him, but each morning was a new adventure. She couldn\u0027t count the number of things that had been done, and by evening she was still finding new touches-and another night had come.\\n\\n She tried to help only once and her human clumsiness marred that. He was in the next room, and she was hanging a picture in the spot marked by Tony\u0027s mathematical eyes. The little mark was there; the picture was there; and a revulsion against idleness was there.\\n\\n But she was nervous, or the ladder was rickety. It didn\u0027t matter. She felt it going, and she cried out. It tumbled without her, for Tony, with far more than flesh-and-blood quickness, had been under her.\\n\\n His calm, dark eyes said nothing at all, and his warm voice said only words. \"Are you hurt, Mrs. Belmont?\"\\n\\n She noticed for an instant that her falling hand must have mussed that sleek hair of his, because for the first time she could see for herself that it was composed of distinct strands-fine black hairs.\\n\\n And then, all at once, she was conscious of his arms about her shoulders and under her knees-holding her tightly and warmly.\\n\\n She pushed, and her scream was loud in her own ears. She spent the rest of the day in her room, and thereafter she slept with a chair upended against the doorknob of her bedroom door.\\n\\n She had sent out the invitations, and, as Tony had said, they were accepted. She had only to wait for the last evening.\\n\\n It came, too, after the rest of them, in its proper place. The house was scarcely her own. She went through it one last time-and every room had been changed. She, herself, was in clothes she would never have dared wear before... And when you put them on, you put on pride and confidence with them.\\n\\n She tried a polite look of contemptuous amusement before the minor, and the mirror sneered back at her masterfully.\\n\\n What would Larry say?... It didn\u0027t matter, somehow. The exciting days weren\u0027t coming with him. They were leaving with Tony. Now wasn\u0027t that strange? She tried to recapture her mood of three weeks before and failed completely.\\n\\n The clock shrieked eight at her in eight breathless installments, and she turned to Tony. \"They\u0027ll be here soon, Tony. You\u0027d better get into the basement. We can\u0027t let them-\"\\n\\n She stared a moment, then said weakly, \"Tony?\" and more strongly, \"Tony?\" and nearly a scream, \"Tony!\"\\n\\n But his arms were around her now; his face was close to hers; the pressure of his embrace was relentless. She heard his voice through a haze of emotional jumble.\\n\\n \"Claire,\" the voice said, \"there are many things I am not made to understand, and this must be one of them. I am leaving tomorrow, and I don\u0027t want to. I find that there is more in me than just a desire to please you. Isn\u0027t it strange?\"\\n\\n His face was closer; his lips were warm, but with no breath behind them -for machines do not breathe. They were almost on hers.\\n\\n ... And the bell sounded.\\n\\n For a moment, she struggled breathlessly, and then he was gone and nowhere in sight, and the bell was sounding again. Its intermittent shrillness was insistent. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-15.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
