{"id":71117,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"The curtains on the front windows had been pulled open. They had been closed fifteen minutes earlier. She knew that. They must have seen, then. They must all have seen-everything! They came in so politely, all in a bunch-the pack come to howl-with their sharp, darting eyes piercing everywhere. They had seen. Why else would Gladys ask in her jabbingest manner after Larry? And Claire was spurred to a desperate and reckless defiance. Yes, he is away. He\u0027ll be back tomorrow, I suppose. No, I haven\u0027t been lonely here myself. Not a bit. I\u0027ve had an exciting time. And she laughed at them. Why not? What could they do? Larry would know the truth, if it ever came to him, the story of what they thought they saw. But they didn\u0027t laugh. She could read that in the fury in Gladys Claffern\u0027s eyes; in the false sparkle of her words; in her desire to leave early. And as she parted with them, she caught one last, anonymous whisper-disjointed. \"... never saw anything like... so handsome-\" And she knew what it was that had enabled her to finger-snap them so. Let each cat mew; and let each cat know-that she might be prettier than Claire Belmont, and grander, and richer-but not one, not one, could have so handsome a lover! And then she remembered again-again-again, that Tony was a machine, and her skin crawled. \"Go away! Leave me be!\" she cried to the empty room and ran to her bed. She wept wakefully all that night and the next morning, almost before dawn, when the streets were empty, a car drew up to the house and took Tony away. Lawrence Belmont passed Dr. Calvin\u0027s office, and, on impulse, knocked. He found her with Mathematician Peter Bogert, but did not hesitate on that account. He said, \"Claire tells me that U.S. Robots paid for all that was done at my house-\" \"Yes,\" said Dr. Calvin. \"We\u0027ve written it off, as a valuable and necessary part of the experiment. With your new position as Associate Engineer, you\u0027ll be able to keep it up, I think.\" \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m worried about. With Washington agreeing to the tests, we\u0027ll be able to get a TN model of our own by next year, I think.\" He turned hesitantly, as though to go, and as hesitantly turned back again. \"Well, Mr. Belmont?\" asked Dr. Calvin, after a pause. \"I wonder-\" began Larry. \"I wonder what really happened there. She- Claire, I mean-seems so different. It\u0027s not just her looks-though, frankly, I\u0027m amazed.\" He laughed nervously. \"It\u0027s her! She\u0027s not my wife, really-I can\u0027t explain it.\" \"Why try? Are you disappointed with any part of the change?\" \"On the contrary. But it\u0027s a little frightening, too, you see-\" \"I wouldn\u0027t worry, Mr. Belmont. Your wife has handled herself very well. Frankly, I never expected to have the experiment yield such a thorough and complete test. We know exactly what corrections must be made in the TN model, and the credit belongs entirely to Mrs. Belmont. If you want me to be very honest, I think your wife deserves your promotion more than you do.\" Larry flinched visibly at that. \"As long as it\u0027s in the family,\" he murmured unconvincingly and left. Susan Calvin looked after him, \"I think that hurt-I hope... Have you read Tony\u0027s report, Peter?\" \"Thoroughly,\" said Bogert. \"And won\u0027t the TN-3 model need changes?\" \"Oh, you think so, too?\" questioned Calvin sharply. \"What\u0027s your reasoning?\" Bogert frowned. \"I don\u0027t need any. It\u0027s obvious on the face of it that we can\u0027t have a robot loose which makes love to his mistress, if you don\u0027t mind the pun.\" \"Love! Peter, you sicken me. You really don\u0027t understand? That machine had to obey the First Law. He couldn\u0027t allow harm to come to a human being, and harm was coming to Claire Belmont through her own sense of inadequacy. So he made love to her, since what woman would fail to appreciate the compliment of being able to stir passion in a machine-in a cold, soulless machine. And he opened the curtains that night deliberately, that the others might see and envy-without any risk possible to Claire\u0027s marriage. I think it was clever of Tony-\" \"Do you? What\u0027s the difference whether it was pretense or not, Susan? It still has its horrifying effect. Read the report again. She avoided him. She screamed when he held her. She didn\u0027t sleep that last night-in hysterics. We can\u0027t have that.\" \"Peter, you\u0027re blind. You\u0027re as blind as I was. The TN model will be rebuilt entirely, but not for your reason. Quite otherwise; quite otherwise. Strange that I overlooked it in the first place,\" her eyes were opaquely thoughtful, \"but perhaps it reflects a shortcoming in myself. You see, Peter, machines can\u0027t fall in love, but-even when it\u0027s hopeless and horrifying- women can!\" Hell-Fire There was a stir as of a very polite first-night audience. Only a handful of scientists were present, a sprinkling of high brass, some Congressmen, a few newsmen. Alvin Homer of the Washington Bureau of the Continental Press found himself next to Joseph Vincenzo of Los Alamos, and said, \"Now we ought to learn something.\" Vincenzo stared at him through bifocals and said, \"Not the important thing.\" Homer frowned. This was to be the first super-slow-motion films of an atomic explosion. With trick lenses changing directional polarization in flickers, the moment of explosion would be divided into billionth-second snaps. Yesterday, an A-bomb had exploded. Today, those snaps would show the explosion in incredible detail. Horner said, \"You think this won\u0027t work?\" Vincenzo looked tormented. \"It will work. We\u0027ve run pilot tests. But the important thing-\" \"Which is?\" \"That these bombs are man\u0027s death sentence. We don\u0027t seem to be able to learn that.\" Vincenzo nodded. \"Look at them here. They\u0027re excited and thrilled, but not afraid.\" The newsman said, \"They know the danger. They\u0027re afraid, too.\" \"Not enough,\" said the scientist. \"I\u0027ve seen men watch an H-bomb blow an island into a hole and then go home and sleep. That\u0027s the way men are. For thousands of years, hell-fire has been preached to them, and it\u0027s made no real impression.\" \"Hell-fire: Are you religious, sir?\" \"What you saw yesterday was hell-fire. An exploding atom bomb is hell-fire. Literally.\" That was enough for Homer. He got up and changed his seat, but watched the audience uneasily. Were any afraid? Did any worry about hell-fire? It didn\u0027t seem so to him. The lights went out, the projector started. On the screen, the firing tower stood gaunt. The audience grew tensely quiet. Then a dot of light appeared at the apex of the tower, a brilliant, burning point, slowly budding in a lazy, outward elbowing, this way and that, taking on uneven shapes of light and shadow, growing oval. A man cried out chokingly, then others. A hoarse babble of noise, followed by thick silence. Horner could smell fear, taste terror in his own mouth, feel his blood freeze. The oval fireball had sprouted projections, then paused a moment in stasis, before expanding rapidly into a bright and featureless sphere. That moment of stasis-the fireball had shown dark spots for eyes, with dark lines for thin, flaring eyebrows, a hairline coming down V-shaped, a mouth twisted upward, laughing wildly in the hell-fire-and horns. The Last Trump The Archangel Gabriel was quite casual about the whole thing. Idly, he let the tip of one wing graze the planet Mars, which, being of mere matter, was unaffected by the contact. He said, \"It\u0027s a settled matter, Etheriel. There\u0027s nothing to be done about it now. The Day of Resurrection is due.\" Etheriel, a very junior seraph who had been created not quite a thousand years earlier as men counted time, quivered so that distinct vortices appeared in the continuum. Ever since his creation, he had been in immediate charge of Earth and environs. As a job, it was a sinecure, a cubbyhole, a dead end, but through the centuries he had come to take a perverse pride in the world. \"But you\u0027ll be disrupting my world without notice.\" \"Not at all. Not at all. Certain passages occur in the Book of Daniel and in the Apocalypse of St. John which are clear enough.\" \"They are? Having been copied from scribe to scribe? I wonder if two words in a row are left unchanged.\" \"There are hints in the Rig-Veda, in the Confucian Analects-\" \"Which are the property of isolated cultural groups which exist as a thin aristocracy-\" \"The Gilgamesh Chronicle speaks out plainly.\" \"Much of the Gilgamesh Chronicle was destroyed with the library of Ashurbanipal sixteen hundred years, Earth-style, before my creation.\" \"There are certain features of the Great Pyramid and a pattern in the inlaid jewels of the Taj Mahal-\" \"Which are so subtle that no man has ever rightly interpreted them.\" j Gabriel said wearily, \"If you\u0027re going to object to everything, there\u0027s no use discussing the matter. In any case, you ought to know about it. In matters concerning Earth, you\u0027re omniscient.\" \"Yes, if I choose to be. I\u0027ve had much to concern me here and investigating the possibilities of Resurrection did not, I confess, occur to me.\" \"Well, it should have. All the papers involved are in the files of the Council of Ascendants. You could have availed yourself of them at any time.\" \"I tell you all my time was needed here. You have no idea of the deadly efficiency of the Adversary on this planet. It took all my efforts to curb him, and even so-\" \"Why, yes\"-Gabriel stroked a comet as it passed-\"he does seem to have won his little victories. I note as I let the interlocking factual pattern of this miserable little world flow through me that this is one of those setups with matter-energy equivalence.\" \"So it is,\" said Etheriel. \"And they are playing with it.\" \"I\u0027m afraid so.\" \"Then what better time for ending the matter?\" \"I\u0027ll be able to handle it, I assure you. Their nuclear bombs will not destroy them.\" \"I wonder. Well, now suppose you let me continue, Etheriel. The appointed moment approaches.\" The seraph said stubbornly, \"I would like to see the documents in the case.\" \"If you insist.\" The wording of an Act of Ascendancy appeared in glittering symbols against the deep black of the airless firmament. Etheriel read aloud: \"It is hereby directed by order of Council that the Archangel Gabriel, Serial number etcetera, etcetera (well, that\u0027s you, at any rate), will approach Planet, Class A, number G753990, hereinafter known as Earth, and on January 1, 1957, at 12:01 p.m., using local time values-\" He finished reading in gloomy silence. \"Satisfied?\" \"No, but I\u0027m helpless.\" Gabriel smiled. A trumpet appeared in space, in shape like an earthly trumpet, but its burnished gold extended from Earth to sun. It was raised to Gabriel\u0027s glittering beautiful lips. \"Can\u0027t you let me have a little time to take this up with the Council?\" asked Etheriel desperately. \"What good would it do you? The act is countersigned by the Chief, and you know that an act countersigned by the Chief is absolutely irrevocable. And now, if you don\u0027t mind, it is almost the stipulated second and I want to be done with this as I have other matters of much greater moment on my mind. Would you step out of my way a little? Thank you.\" Gabriel blew, and a clean, thin sound of perfect pitch and crystalline delicacy filled all the universe to the furthest star. As it sounded, there was a tiny moment of stasis as thin as the line separating past from future, and then the fabric of worlds collapsed upon itself and matter was gathered back into the primeval chaos from which it had once sprung at a word. The stars and nebulae were gone, and the cosmic dust, the sun, the planets, the moon; all, all, all except Earth itself, which spun as before in a universe now completely empty. The Last Trump had sounded. R. E. Mann, (known to all who knew him simply as R.E.) eased himself into the offices: of the Billikan Bitsies factory and stared somberly at the tall man (gaunt but with a certain faded elegance about his neat gray mustache) who bent intently over a sheaf of papers on his desk. R.E. looked at his wristwatch, which still said 7:01, having ceased running at that time. It was Eastern standard time, of course; 12:01 p.m. Greenwich time. His dark brown eyes, staring sharply out over a pair of pronounced cheekbones, caught those of the other. For a moment, the tall man stared at him blankly. Then he said, \"Can I do anything for you?\" \"Horatio J. Billikan, I presume? Owner of this place?\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m R. E. Mann and I couldn\u0027t help but stop in when I finally found someone at work. Don\u0027t you know what today is?\" \"Today?\" \"It\u0027s Resurrection Day.\" \"Oh, that! I know it. I heard the blast. Fit to wake the dead... That\u0027s rather a good one, don\u0027t you think?\" He chuckled for a moment, then went on. \"It woke me at seven in the morning. I nudged my wife. She slept through it, of course. I always said she would. \u0027It\u0027s the Last Trump, dear,\u0027 I said. Hortense, that\u0027s my wife, said, \u0027All right,\u0027 and went back to sleep. I bathed, shaved, dressed and came to work.\" \"But why?\u0027\" \"Why not?\"\u0027 \"None of your workers have come in.\" \"No, poor souls. They\u0027ll take a holiday just at first. You\u0027ve got to expect that. After all, it isn\u0027t every day that the world comes to an end. Frankly, it\u0027s just as well. It: gives me a chance to straighten out my personal correspondence without interruptions. Telephone hasn\u0027t rung once.\" He stood up and went to the window. \"It\u0027s a great improvement. No blinding sun any more and the snow\u0027s gone. There\u0027s a pleasant light and a pleasant warmth. Very good arrangement... But now, if you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027m rather busy, so if you\u0027ll excuse me-\" A great, hoarse voice interrupted with a, \"Just a minute, Horatio,\" and a gentleman, looking remarkably like Billikan in a somewhat craggier way, followed his prominent nose into the office and struck an attitude of offended dignity which was scarcely spoiled by the fact that he was quite naked. \"May I ask why you\u0027ve shut down Bitsies?\" Billikan looked faint. \"Good Heavens,\" he said, \"it\u0027s Father. Wherever did you come from?\" \"From the graveyard,\" roared Billikan, Senior. \"Where on Earth else? They\u0027re coming out of the ground there by the dozens. Every one of them naked. Women, too.\" Billikan cleared his throat. \"I\u0027ll get you some clothes, Father. I\u0027ll bring them to you from home.\" \"Never mind that. Business first. Business first.\" R.E. came out of his musing. \"Is everyone coming out of their graves at the same time, sir?\" He stared curiously at Billikan, Senior, as he spoke. The old man\u0027s appearance was one of robust age. His cheeks were furrowed but glowed with health. His age, R.E. decided, was exactly what it was at the moment of his death, but his body was as it should have been at that age if it functioned ideally. Billikan, Senior, said, \"No, sir, they are not. The newer graves are coming up first. Pottersby died five years before me and came up about five minutes after me. Seeing him made me decide to leave. I had had enough of him when... And that reminds me.\" He brought his fist down on the desk, a very solid fist. \"There were no taxis, no busses. Telephones weren\u0027t working. I had to walk. I had to walk twenty miles.\" \"Like that?\" asked his son in a faint and appalled voice.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-16.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
