It was Sterbinski who first devised a method for stopping neutrinos. He invented a neutrino recorder and learned how to interpret the pattern of the neutrino stream. Naturally, the stream had been affected and deflected by all the matter it had passed through in its passage through time, and the deflections could be analyzed and converted into the images of the matter that had done the deflecting. Time viewing was possible. Even air vibrations could be detected in this way and converted into sound.\" Potterley was definitely not listening. He said, \"Yes. Yes. But when can you build a chronoscope?\" Foster said urgently, \"Let me finish. Everything depends on the method used to detect and analyze the neutrino stream. Sterbinski\u0027s method was difficult and roundabout. It required mountains of energy. But I\u0027ve studied pseudo-gravities, Dr. Potterley, the science of artificial gravitational fields. I\u0027ve specialized in the behavior of light in such fields. It\u0027s a new science. Sterbinski knew nothing of it. If he had, he would have seen-anyone would have-a much better and more efficient method of detecting neutrinos using a pseudo-gravitic field. If I had known more neutrinics to begin with, I would have seen it at once.\" Potterley brightened a bit. \"I knew it,\" he said. \"Even if they stop research in neutrinics there is no way the government can be sure that discoveries in other segments of science won\u0027t reflect knowledge on neutrinics. So much for the value of centralized direction of science. 1 thought this long ago, Dr. Foster, before you ever came to work here.\" \"I congratulate you on that,\" said Foster, \"but there\u0027s one thing-\" \"Oh, never mind all this. Answer me. Please. When can you build a chronoscope?\" \"I\u0027m trying to tell you something, Dr. Potterley. A chronoscope won\u0027t do you any good.\" (This is it, Foster thought.) Slowly, Potterley descended the stairs. He stood facing Foster. \"What do you mean? Why won\u0027t it help me?\" \"You won\u0027t see Carthage. It\u0027s what I\u0027ve got to tell you. It\u0027s what I\u0027ve been leading up to. You can never see Carthage.\" Potterley shook his head slightly. \"Oh, no, you\u0027re wrong. If you have the chronoscope, just focus it properly-\" \"No, Dr. Potterley. It\u0027s not a question of focus. There are random factors affecting the neutrino stream, as they affect all subatomic particles. What we call the uncertainty principle. When the stream is recorded and interpreted, the random factor comes out as fuzziness, or \u0027noise\u0027 as the communications boys speak of it. The further back in time you penetrate, the more pronounced the fuzziness, the greater the noise. After a while, the noise drowns out the picture. Do you understand?\" \"More power,\" said Potterley in a dead kind of voice. \"That won\u0027t help. When the noise blurs out detail, magnifying detail magnifies the noise, too. You can\u0027t see anything in a sun-burned film by enlarging it, can you? Get this through your head, now. The physical nature of the universe sets limits. The random thermal motions of air molecules set limits to how weak a sound can be detected by any instrument. The length of a light wave or of an electron wave sets limits to the size of objects that can be seen by any instrument. It works that way in chronoscopy, too. You can only time view so far.\" \"How far? How far?\" Foster took a deep breath. \"A century and a quarter. That\u0027s the most.\" \"But the monthly bulletin the Commission puts out deals with ancient history almost entirely.\" The historian laughed shakily. \"You must be wrong. The government has data as far back as 3000 b.c.\" \"When did you switch to believing them?\" demanded Foster, scornfully. \"You began this business by proving they were lying; that no historian had made use of the chronoscope. Don\u0027t you see why now? No historian, except one interested in contemporary history, could. No chronoscope can possibly see back in time further than 1920 under any conditions.\" \"You\u0027re wrong. You don\u0027t know everything,\" said Potterley. \"The truth won\u0027t bend itself to your convenience either. Face it. The government\u0027s part in this is to perpetuate a hoax.\" \"Why?\" \"I don\u0027t know why.\" Potterley\u0027s snubby nose was twitching. His eyes were bulging. He pleaded, \"It\u0027s only theory, Dr. Foster. Build a chronoscope. Build one and try.\" Foster caught Potterley\u0027s shoulders in a sudden, fierce grip. \"Do you think I haven\u0027t? Do you think I would tell you this before I had checked it every way I knew? I have built one. It\u0027s all around you. Look!\" He ran to the switches at the power leads. He flicked them on, one by one. He turned a resistor, adjusted other knobs, put out the cellar lights. \"Wait. Let it warm up.\" There was a small glow near the center of one wall. Potterley was gibbering incoherently, but Foster only cried again, \"Look!\" The light sharpened and brightened, broke up into a light-and-dark pattern. Men and women! Fuzzy. Features blurred. Arms and legs mere streaks. An old-fashioned ground car, unclear but recognizable as one of the kind that had once used gasoline-powered internal-combustion engines, sped by. Foster said, \"Mid-twentieth century, somewhere. I can\u0027t hook up an audio yet so this is soundless. Eventually, we can add sound. Anyway, mid-twentieth is almost as far back as you can go. Believe me, that\u0027s the best focusing that can be done.\" Potterley said, \"Build a larger machine, a stronger one. Improve your circuits.\" \"You can\u0027t lick the Uncertainty Principle, man, any more than you can live on the sun. There are physical limits to what can be done.\" \"You\u0027re lying. I won\u0027t believe you. I-\" A new voice sounded, raised shrilly to make itself heard. \"Arnold! Dr. Foster!\" The young physicist turned at once. Dr. Potterley froze for a long moment, then said, without turning, \"What is it, Caroline? Leave us.\" \"No!\" Mrs. Potterley descended the stairs. \"I heard. I couldn\u0027t help hearing. Do you have a time viewer here, Dr. Foster? Here in the basement?\" \"Yes, I do, Mrs. Potterley. A kind of time viewer. Not a good one. I can\u0027t get sound yet and the picture is darned blurry, but it works.\" Mrs. Potterley clasped her hands and held them tightly against her breast. \"How wonderful. How wonderful.\" \"It\u0027s not at all wonderful,\" snapped Potterley. \"The young fool can\u0027t reach further back than-\" \"Now, look,\" began Foster in exasperation... \"Please!\" cried Mrs. Potterley. \"Listen to me. Arnold, don\u0027t you see that as long as we can use it for twenty years back, we can see Laurel once again? What do we care about Carthage and ancient times? It\u0027s Laurel we can see. She\u0027ll be alive for us again. Leave the machine here, Dr. Foster. Show us how to work it.\" Foster stared at her then at her husband. Dr. Potterley\u0027s face had gone white. Though his voice stayed low and even, its calmness was somehow gone. He said, \"You\u0027re a fool!\" Caroline said weakly, \"Arnold!\" \"You\u0027re a fool, I say. What will you see? The past. The dead past. Will Laurel do one thing she did not do? Will you see one thing you haven\u0027t seen? Will you live three years over and over again, watching a baby who\u0027ll never grow up no matter how you watch?\" His voice came near to cracking, but held. He stopped closer to her, seized her shoulder and shook her roughly. \"Do you know what will happen to you if you do that? They\u0027ll come to take you away because you\u0027ll go mad. Yes, mad. Do you want mental treatment? Do you want to be shut up, to undergo the psychic probe?\" Mrs. Potterley tore away. There was no trace of softness or vagueness about her. She had twisted into a virago. \"I want to see my child, Arnold. She\u0027s in that machine and I want her.\" \"She\u0027s not in the machine. An image is. Can\u0027t you understand? An image! Something that\u0027s not real!\" \"I want my child. Do you hear me?\" She flew at him, screaming, fists beating. \"I want my child.\" The historian retreated at the fury of the assault, crying out. Foster moved to step between, when Mrs. Potterley dropped, sobbing wildly, to the floor. Potterley turned, eyes desperately seeking. With a sudden heave, he snatched at a Lando-rod, tearing it from its support, and whirling away before Foster, numbed by all that was taking place, could move to stop him. \"Stand back!\" gasped Potterley, \"or I\u0027ll kill you. I swear it.\" He swung with force, and Foster jumped back. Potterley turned with fury on every part of the structure in the cellar, and Foster, after the first crash of glass, watched dazedly. Potterley spent his rage and then he was standing quietly amid shards and splinters, with a broken Lando-rod in his hand. He said to Foster in a whisper, \"Now get out of here! Never come back! If any of this cost you anything, send me a bill and I\u0027ll pay for it. I\u0027ll pay double.\" Foster shrugged, picked up his shirt and moved up the basement stairs. He could hear Mrs. Potterley sobbing loudly, and, as he turned at the head of the stairs for a last look, he saw Dr. Potterley bending over her, his face convulsed with sorrow. Two days later, with the school day drawing to a close, and Foster looking wearily about to see if there were any data on his newly approved projects that he wished to take home, Dr. Potterley appeared once more. He was standing at the open door of Foster\u0027s office. The historian was neatly dressed as ever. He lifted his hand in a gesture that was too vague to be a greeting, too abortive to be a plea. Foster stared stonily. Potterley said, \"I waited till five, till you were... May I come in?\" Foster nodded. Potterley said, \"I suppose I ought to apologize for my behavior. I was dreadfully disappointed; not quite master of myself. Still, it was inexcusable.\" \"I accept your apology,\" said Foster. \"Is that all?\" \"My wife called you, I think.\" \"Yes, she has.\" \"She has been quite hysterical. She told me she had but I couldn\u0027t be quite sure-\" \"Could you tell me-would you be so kind as to tell me what she wanted?\" \"She wanted a chronoscope. She said she had some money of her own. She was willing to pay.\" \"Did you-make any commitments?\" \"I said I wasn\u0027t in the manufacturing business.\" \"Good,\" breathed Potterley, his chest expanding with a sigh of relief. \u0027\u0027Please don\u0027t take any calls from her. She\u0027s not-quite-\" \"Look, Dr. Potterfey,\" said Foster, \"I\u0027m not getting into any domestic quarrels, but you\u0027d better be prepared for something. Chronoscopes can be built by anybody Given a few simple parts that can be bought through some etherics sales center, it can be built in the home workshop. The video part, anyway.\" \"But no one else will think of it beside you, will they? No one has.\" \"I don\u0027t intend to keep it secret.\" \"But you can\u0027t publish. It\u0027s illegal research.\" \"That doesn\u0027t matter any more, Dr. Potterley. If I lose my grants, I lose them. If the university is displeased, I\u0027ll resign. It just doesn\u0027t matter.\" \"But you can\u0027t do that!\" \"Till now,\" said Foster, \"you didn\u0027t mind my risking loss of grants and position. Why do you turn so tender about it now? Now let me explain something to you. When you first came to me, I believed in organized and directed research; the situation as it existed, in other words. I considered you an intellectual anarchist, Dr. Potterley, and dangerous. But, for one reason or another, I\u0027ve been an anarchist myself for months now and I have achieved great things. \"Those things have been achieved not because I am a brilliant scientist. Not at all. It was just that scientific research had been directed from above and holes were left that could be filled in by anyone who looked in the right direction. And anyone might have if the government hadn\u0027t actively tried to prevent it. \"Now understand me. I still believe directed research can be useful. I\u0027m not in favor of a retreat to total anarchy. But there must be a middle ground. Directed research can retain flexibility. A scientist must be allowed to follow his curiosity, at least in his spare time.\" Potterley sat down. He said ingratiatingly, \"Let\u0027s discuss this, Foster. I appreciate your idealism. You\u0027re young. You want the moon. But you can\u0027t destroy yourself through fancy notions of what research must consist of. I got you into this. I am responsible and I blame myself bitterly. I was acting emotionally. My interest in Carthage blinded me and I was a damned fool.\" Foster broke in. \"You mean you\u0027ve changed completely in two days? Carthage is nothing? Government suppression of research is nothing?\" \"Even a damned fool like myself can learn, Foster. My wife taught me something. I understand the reason for government suppression of neutrinics now. I didn\u0027t two days ago. And, understanding, I approve. You saw the way my wife reacted to the news of a chronoscope in the basement. I had envisioned a chronoscope used for research purposes. All she could see was the personal pleasure of returning neurotically to a personal past, a dead past. The pure researcher, Foster, is in the minority. People like my wife would outweigh us. \"For the government to encourage chronoscopy would have meant that everyone\u0027s past would be visible. The government officers would be subjected to blackmail and improper pressure, since who on Earth has a past that is absolutely clean? Organized government might become impossible.\" Foster licked his lips. \"Maybe. Maybe the government has some justification in its own eyes. Still, there\u0027s an important principle involved here. Who knows what other scientific advances are being stymied because scientists are being stifled into walking a narrow path? If the chronoscope becomes the terror of a few politicians, it\u0027s a price that must be paid. The public must realize that science must be free and there is no more dramatic way of doing it than to publish my discovery, one way or another, legally or illegally.\" Potterley\u0027s brow was damp with perspiration, but his voice remained even. \"Oh, not just a few politicians, Dr. Foster. Don\u0027t think that. It would be my terror, too. My wife would spend her time living with our dead daughter. She would retreat further from reality. She would go mad living the same scenes over and over. And not just my terror. There would be others like her. Children searching for their dead parents or their own youth. We\u0027ll have a whole world living in the past. Midsummer madness.\" Foster said, \"Moral judgments can\u0027t stand in the way. There isn\u0027t one advance at any time in history that mankind hasn\u0027t had the ingenuity to pervert. Mankind must also have the ingenuity to prevent. As for the chronoscope, your delvers into the dead past will get tired soon enough. They\u0027ll catch their loved parents in some of the things their loved parents did and they\u0027ll lose their enthusiasm for it all. But all this is trivial. With me, it\u0027s a matter of important principle.\" Potterley said, \"Hang your principle. Can\u0027t you understand men and women as well as principle? Don\u0027t you understand that my wife will live through the fire that killed our baby? She won\u0027t be able to help herself. I know her. She\u0027ll follow through each step, trying to prevent it. She\u0027ll live it over and over again, hoping each time that it won\u0027t happen. How many times do you want to kill Laurel?\" A huskiness had crept into his voice. A thought crossed Foster\u0027s mind. \"What are you really afraid she\u0027ll find out, Dr. Potterley? What happened the night of the fire?\" The historian\u0027s hands went up quickly to cover his face and they shook with his dry sobs. Foster turned away and stared uncomfortably out the window. Potterley said after a while, \"It\u0027s a long time since I\u0027ve had to think of it. Caroline was away. I was baby-sitting. I went into the baby\u0027s bedroom midevening to see if she had kicked off the bedclothes. I had my cigarette with me... I smoked in those days. I must have stubbed it out before putting it in the ashtray on the chest of drawers. I was always careful. The baby was all right. I returned to the living room and fell asleep before the video. I awoke, choking, surrounded by fire. I don\u0027t know how it started.\" \"But you think it may have been the cigarette, is that it?\" said Foster. \"A cigarette which, for once, you forgot to stub out?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I tried to save her, but she was dead in my arms when I got out.\" \"You never told your wife about the cigarette, I suppose.\" Potterley shook his head. \"But I\u0027ve lived with it.\" \"Only now, with a chronoscope, she\u0027ll find out. Maybe it wasn\u0027t the cigarette. Maybe you did stub it out. Isn\u0027t that possible?\" The scant tears had dried on Potterley\u0027s face. The redness had subsided. He said, \"I can\u0027t take the chance... But it\u0027s not just myself, Foster. The past has its terrors for most people. Don\u0027t loose those terrors on the human race.\" Foster paced the floor. Somehow, this explained the reason for Potterley\u0027s rabid, irrational desire to boost the Carthaginians, deify them, most of all disprove the story of their fiery sacrifices to Moloch. By freeing them of the guilt of infanticide by fire, he symbolically freed himself of the same guilt.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-5.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
