I think he\u0027s trying to build up a store of jokes in Multivac\u0027s memory banks in order to get back new variations. You see what I mean? He\u0027s planning a mechanical jokester, so that he can have an infinite number of jokes at hand and never fear running out.\"\\n\\n \"Good Lord!\"\\n\\n \"Objectively, there may be nothing wrong with that, but I consider it a bad sign when a Grand Master starts using Multivac for his personal problems. Any Grand Master has a certain inherent mental instability and he should be watched. Meyerhof may be approaching a borderline beyond which we lose a Grand Master.\"\\n\\n Trask said blankly, \"What are you suggesting I do?\"\\n\\n \"You can check me. I\u0027m too close to him to judge well, maybe, and judging humans isn\u0027t my particular talent, anyway. You\u0027re a politician; it\u0027s more your talent.\"\\n\\n \"Judging humans, perhaps, not Grand Masters.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re human, too. Besides, who else is to do it?\"\\n\\n The fingers of Trask\u0027s hand struck his desk in rapid succession over and over like a slow and muted roll of drums.\\n\\n \"I suppose I\u0027ll have to,\" he said.\\n\\n Meyerhof said to Multivac, \"The ardent swain, picking a bouquet of wildflowers for his loved one, was disconcerted to find himself, suddenly, in the same field with a large bull of unfriendly appearance which, gazing at him steadily, pawed the ground in a threatening manner. The young man, spying a farmer on the other side of a fairly distant fence, shouted, \u0027Hey, mister, is that bull safe?\u0027 The farmer surveyed the situation with critical eye, spat to one side and called back, \u0027He\u0027s safe as anything.\u0027 He spat again, and added, \u0027Can\u0027t say the same about you, though.\"\\n\\n Meyerhof was about to pass on to the next when the summons came.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t really a summons. No one could summon a Grand Master. It was only a message that Division Head Trask would like very much to see Grand Master Meyerhof if Grand Master Meyerhof could spare him the time.\\n\\n Meyerhof might, with impunity, have tossed the message to one side and continued with whatever he was doing. He was not subject to discipline.\\n\\n On the other hand, were he to do that, they would continue to bother him-oh, very respectfully, but they would continue to bother him.\\n\\n So he neutralized the pertinent circuits of Multivac and locked them into place. He put the freeze signal on his office so that no one would dare enter in his absence and left for Trask\u0027s office.\\n\\n Trask coughed and felt a bit intimidated by the sullen fierceness of the other\u0027s look. He said, \"We have not had occasion to know one another, Grand Master, to my great regret.\"\\n\\n \"I have reported to you,\" said Meyerhof stiffly.\\n\\n Trask wondered what lay behind those keen, wild eyes. It was difficult for him to imagine Meyerhof with his thin face, his dark, straight hair, his intense air, even unbending long enough to tell funny stories.\\n\\n He said, \"Reports are not social acquaintance. I-I have been given to understand you have a marvelous fund of anecdotes.\"\\n\\n \"I am a jokester, sir. That\u0027s the phrase people use. A jokester.\"\\n\\n \"They haven\u0027t used the phrase to me, Grand Master. They have said-\"\\n\\n \"The hell with them! I don\u0027t care what they\u0027ve said. See here, Trask, do you want to hear a joke?\" He leaned forward across the desk, his eyes narrowed.\\n\\n \"By all means. Certainly,\" said Trask, with an effort at heartiness.\\n\\n \"All right. Here\u0027s the joke: Mrs. Jones stared at the fortune card that had emerged from the weighing machine in response to her husband\u0027s penny. She said, \u0027It says here, George, that you\u0027re suave, intelligent, farseeing, industrious and attractive to women.\u0027 With that, she turned the card over and added, \u0027And they have your weight wrong, too.\u0027 \"\\n\\n Trask laughed. It was almost impossible not to. Although the punch line was predictable, the surprising facility with which Meyerhof had produced just the tone of contemptuous disdain in the woman\u0027s voice, and the cleverness with which he had contorted the lines of his face to suit that tone carried the politician helplessly into laughter.\\n\\n Meyerhof said sharply, \"Why is that funny?\"\\n\\n Trask sobered. \"I beg your pardon.\"\\n\\n \"I said, why is that funny? Why do you laugh?\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Trask, trying to be reasonable, \"the last line put every thing that preceded in a new light. The unexpectedness-\"\\n\\n \"The point is,\" said Meyerhof, \"that I have pictured a husband being humiliated by his wife; a marriage that is such a failure that the wife is convinced that her husband lacks any virtue. Yet you laugh at that. If you were the husband, would you find it funny?\"\\n\\n He waited a moment in thought, then said, \"Try this one, Trask: Abner was seated at his wife\u0027s sickbed, weeping uncontrollably, when his wife, mustering the dregs of her strength, drew herself up to one elbow.\\n\\n \"\u0027Abner,\u0027 she whispered, \u0027Abner, I cannot go to my Maker without confessing my misdeed.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Not now,\u0027 muttered the stricken husband. \u0027Not now, my dear. Lie back and rest.\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027I cannot,\u0027 she cried. \u0027I must tell, or my soul will never know peace. I have been unfaithful to you, Abner. In this very house, not one month ago-\u0027\\n\\n \"\u0027Hush, dear,\u0027 soothed Abner. \u0027I know all about it. Why else have I poisoned you?\u0027 \"\\n\\n Trask tried desperately to maintain equanimity but did not entirely succeed. He suppressed a chuckle imperfectly.\\n\\n Meyerhof said, \"So that\u0027s funny, too. Adultery. Murder. All funny.\"\\n\\n \"Well, now,\" said Trask, \"books have been written analyzing humor.\"\\n\\n \"True enough,\" said Meyerhof, \"and I\u0027ve read a number of them. What\u0027s more, I\u0027ve read most of them to Multivac. Still, the people who write the books are just guessing. Some of them say we laugh because we feel superior to the people in the joke. Some say it is because of a suddenly realized incongruity, or a sudden relief from tension, or a sudden reinterpretation of events. Is there any simple reason? Different people laugh at different jokes. No joke is universal. Some people don\u0027t laugh at any joke. Yet what may be most important is that man is the only animal with a true sense of humor: the only animal that laughs.\"\\n\\n Trask said suddenly, \"I understand. You\u0027re trying to analyze humor. That\u0027s why you\u0027re transmitting a series of jokes to Multivac.\"\\n\\n \"Who told you I was doing that?... Never mind, it was Whistler. I remember, now. He surprised me at it. Well, what about it?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing at all.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t dispute my right to add anything I wish to Multivac\u0027s general fund of knowledge, or to ask any question I wish?\"\\n\\n \"No, not at all,\" said Trask hastily. \"As a matter of fact, I have no doubt that this will open the way to new analyses of great interest to psychologists.\"\\n\\n \"Hmp. Maybe. Just the same there\u0027s something plaguing me that\u0027s more important than just the general analysis of humor. There\u0027s a specific question I have to ask. Two of them, really.\"\\n\\n \"Oh? What\u0027s that?\" Trask wondered if the other would answer. There would be no way of compelling him if he chose not to.\\n\\n But Meyerhof said, \"The first question is this: Where do all these jokes come from?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Who makes them up? Listen! About a month ago, I spent an evening swapping jokes. As usual, I told most of them and, as usual, the fools laughed. Maybe they really thought the jokes were funny and maybe they were just humoring me. In any case, one creature took the liberty of slapping me on the back and saying, \u0027Meyerhof, you know more jokes than any ten people I know.\u0027\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he was right, but it gave rise to a thought. I don\u0027t know how many hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of jokes I\u0027ve told at one time or another in my life, yet the fact is I never made up one. Not one. I\u0027d only repeated them. My only contribution was to tell them. To begin with, I\u0027d either heard them or read them. And the source of my hearing or reading didn\u0027t make up the jokes, either. I never met anyone who ever claimed to have constructed a joke. It\u0027s always \u0027I heard a good one the other day,\u0027 and \u0027Heard any good ones lately?\u0027\\n\\n \"All the jokes are old! That\u0027s why jokes exhibit such a social lag. They still deal with seasickness, for instance, when that\u0027s easily prevented these days and never experienced. Or they\u0027ll deal with fortune-giving weighing machines, like the joke I told you, when such machines are found only in antique shops. Well, then, who makes up the jokes?\"\\n\\n Trask said, \"Is that what you\u0027re trying to find out?\" It was on the tip of Trask\u0027s tongue to add: Good Lord, who cares? He forced that impulse down. A Grand Master\u0027s questions were always meaningful.\\n\\n \"Of course that\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to find out. Think of it this way. It\u0027s not just that jokes happen to be old. They must be old to be enjoyed. It\u0027s essential that a joke not be original. There\u0027s one variety of humor that is, or can be, original and that\u0027s the pun. I\u0027ve heard puns that were obviously made up on the spur of the moment. I have made some up myself. But no one laughs at such puns. You\u0027re not supposed to. You groan. The better the pun, the louder the groan. Original humor is not laugh-provoking. Why?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"All right. Let\u0027s find out. Having given Multivac all the information I thought advisable on the general topic of humor, I am now feeding it selected jokes.\"\\n\\n Trask found himself intrigued. \"Selected how?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Meyerhof. \"They felt like the right ones. I\u0027m Grand Master, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, agreed. Agreed.\"\\n\\n \"From those jokes and the general philosophy of humor, my first request will be for Multivac to trace the origin of the jokes, if it can. Since Whistler is in on this and since he has seen fit to report it to you, have him down in Analysis day after tomorrow. I think he\u0027ll have a bit of work to do.\"\\n\\n \"Certainly. May I attend, too?\"\\n\\n Meyerhof shrugged. Trask\u0027s attendance was obviously a matter of indifference to him.\\n\\n Meyerhof had selected the last in the series with particular care. What that care consisted of, he could not have said, but he had revolved a dozen possibilities in his mind, and over and over again had tested each for some indefinable quality of meaningfulness.\\n\\n He said, \"Ug, the caveman, observed his mate running to him in tears, her leopard-skin skirt in disorder. \u0027Ug,\u0027 she cried, distraught, \u0027do something quickly. A saber-toothed tiger has entered Mother\u0027s cave. Do something!\u0027 Ug grunted, picked up his well-gnawed buffalo bone and said, \u0027Why do anything? Who the hell cares what happens to a saber-toothed tiger?\u0027 \"\\n\\n It was then that Meyerhof asked his two questions and leaned back, closing his eyes. He was done.\\n\\n \"I saw absolutely nothing wrong,\" said Trask to Whistler. \"He told me what he was doing readily enough and it was odd but legitimate.\"\\n\\n \"What he claimed he was doing,\" said Whistler.\\n\\n \"Even so, I can\u0027t stop a Grand Master on opinion alone. He seemed queer but, after all, Grand Masters are supposed to seem queer. I didn\u0027t think him insane.\"\\n\\n \"Using Multivac to find the source of jokes?\" muttered the senior analyst in discontent. \"That\u0027s not insane?\"\\n\\n \"How can we tell?\" asked Trask irritably. \"Science has advanced to the point where the only meaningful questions left are the ridiculous ones. The sensible ones have been thought of, asked and answered long ago.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s no use. I\u0027m bothered.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, but there\u0027s no choice now, Whistler. We\u0027ll see Meyerhof and you can do the necessary analysis of Multivac\u0027s response, if any. As for me, my only job is to handle the red tape. Good Lord, I don\u0027t even know what a senior analyst such as yourself is supposed to do, except analyze, and that doesn\u0027t help me any.\"\\n\\n Whistler said, \"It\u0027s simple enough. A Grand Master like Meyerhof asks questions and Multivac automatically formulates it into quantities and operations. The necessary machinery for converting words to symbols is what makes up most of the bulk of Multivac. Multivac then gives the answer in quantities and operations, but it doesn\u0027t translate that back into words except in the most simple and routine cases. If it were designed to solve the general retranslation problem, its bulk would have to be quadrupled at least.\"\\n\\n \"I see. Then it\u0027s your job to translate these symbols into words?\"\\n\\n \"My job and that of other analysts. We use smaller, specially designed computers whenever necessary.\" Whistler smiled grimly. \"Like the Delphic priestess of ancient Greece, Multivac gives oracular and obscure answers. Only we have translators, you see.\"\\n\\n They had arrived. Meyerhof was waiting.\\n\\n Whistler said briskly, \"What circuits did you use, Grand Master?\"\\n\\n Meyerhof told him and Whistler went to work.\\n\\n Trask tried to follow what was happening, but none of it made sense. The government official watched a spool unreel with a pattern of dots in endless incomprehensibility. Grand Master Meyerhof stood indifferently to one side while Whistler surveyed the pattern as it emerged. The analyst had put on headphones and a mouthpiece and at intervals murmured a series of instructions which, at some far-off place, guided assistants through electronic contortions in other computers.\\n\\n Occasionally, Whistler listened, then punched combinations on a complex keyboard marked with symbols that looked vaguely mathematical but weren\u0027t.\\n\\n A good deal more than an hour\u0027s time elapsed.\\n\\n The frown on Whistler\u0027s face grew deeper. Once, he looked up at the two others and began, \"This is unbel-\" and turned back to his work.\\n\\n Finally, he said hoarsely, \"I can give you an unofficial answer.\" His eyes were red-rimmed. \"The official answer awaits complete analysis. Do you want it unofficial?\"\\n\\n \"Go ahead,\" said Meyerhof.\\n\\n Trask nodded.\\n\\n Whistler darted a hangdog glance at the Grand Master. \"Ask a foolish question-\" he said. Then, gruffly, \"Multivac says, extraterrestrial origin.\"\\n\\n \"What are you saying?\" demanded Trask.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you hear me? The jokes we laugh at were not made up by any man. Multivac has analyzed all data given it and the one answer that best fits that data is that some extraterrestrial intelligence has composed the jokes, all of them, and placed them in selected human minds at selected times and places in such a way that no man is conscious of having made one up. All subsequent jokes are minor variations and adaptations of these grand originals.\"\\n\\n Meyerhof broke in, face flushed with the kind of triumph only a Grand Master can know who once again has asked the right question. \"All comedy writers,\" he said, \"work by twisting old jokes to new purposes. That\u0027s well known. The answer fits.\"\\n\\n \"But why?\" asked Trask. \"Why make up the jokes?\"\\n\\n \"Multivac says,\" said Whistler, \"that the only purpose that fits all the data is that the jokes are intended to study human psychology. We study rat psychology by making the rats solve mazes. The rats don\u0027t know why and wouldn\u0027t even if they were aware of what was going on, which they\u0027re not. These outer intelligences study man\u0027s psychology by noting individual reactions to carefully selected anecdotes. Each man reacts differently... Presumably, these outer intelligences are to us as we are to rats.\" He shuddered.\\n\\n Trask, eyes staring, said, \"The Grand Master said man is the only animal with a sense of humor. It would seem then that the sense of humor is foisted upon us from without.\"\\n\\n Meyerhof added excitedly, \"And for possible humor created from within, we have no laughter. Puns, I mean.\"\\n\\n Whistler said, \"Presumably, the extraterrestrials cancel out reactions to spontaneous jokes to avoid confusion.\"\\n\\n Trask said in sudden agony of spirit, \"Come on, now, Good Lord, do either of you believe this?\"\\n\\n The senior analyst looked at him coldly. \"Multivac says so. It\u0027s all that can be said so far. It has pointed out the real jokesters of the universe, and if we want to know more, the matter will have to be followed up.\" He added in a whisper, \"If anyone dares follow it up.\"\\n\\n Grand Master Meyerhof said suddenly, \"I asked two questions, you know. So far only the first has been answered. I think Multivac has enough data to answer the second.\"\\n\\n Whistler shrugged. He seemed a half-broken man. \"When a Grand Master thinks there is enough data,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll make book on it. What is your second question?\"\\n\\n \"I asked this. What will be the effect on the human race of discovering the answer to my first question?\"\\n\\n \"Why did you ask that?\" demanded Trask.\\n\\n \"Just a feeling that it had to be asked,\" said Meyerhof.\\n\\n Trask said, \"Insane. It\u0027s all insane,\" and turned away. Even he himself felt how strangely he and Whistler had changed sides. Now it was Trask crying insanity.\\n\\n Trask closed his eyes. He might cry insanity all he wished, but no man in fifty years had doubted the combination of a Grand Master and Multivac and found his doubts verified.\\n\\n Whistler worked silently, teeth clenched. He put Multivac and its subsidiary machines through their paces again. Another hour passed and he laughed harshly. \"A raving nightmare!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-20.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
