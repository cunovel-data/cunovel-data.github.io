Anyway, son, I\u0027m not here to make small talk. Why is the factory shut down?\" \"It isn\u0027t shut down. It\u0027s a special occasion.\" \"Special occasion, my foot. You call union headquarters and tell them Resurrection Day isn\u0027t in the contract. Every worker is being docked for every minute he\u0027s off the job.\" Billikan\u0027s lean face took on a stubborn look as he peered at his father. \"I will not. Don\u0027t forget, now, you\u0027re no longer in charge of this plant. I am.\" \"Oh, you are? By what right?\" \"By your will.\" \"All right. Now here I am and I void my will.\" \"You can\u0027t, Father. You\u0027re dead. You may not look dead, but I have witnesses. I have the doctor\u0027s certificate. I have receipted bills from the undertaker. I can get testimony from the pallbearers.\" Billikan, Senior, stared at his son, sat down, placed his arm over the back of the chair, crossed his iegs and said, \"If it conies to that, we\u0027re all dead, aren\u0027t we? The world\u0027s come to an end, hasn\u0027t it?\" \"But you\u0027ve been declared legally dead and 1 haven\u0027t.\" \"Oh, we\u0027ll change that, son. There are going to be more of us than of you and votes count.\" Billikan, Junior, tapped the desk firmly with the flat of his hand and flushed slightly. \"Father, I hate to bring up this particular point, but you force me to. May I remind you that by now 1 am sure that Mother is sitting at home waiting for you; that she probably had to walk the streets-uh- naked, too; and that she probably isn\u0027t in a good humor.\" Billikan, Senior, went ludicrously pale. \"Good Heavens!\" \"And you know she always wanted you to retire.\" Billikan, Senior, came to a quick decision. \"I\u0027m not going home. Why, this is a nightmare. Aren\u0027t there any limits to this Resurrection business? It\u0027s -it\u0027s-it\u0027s sheer anarchy. There\u0027s such a thing as overdoing it. I\u0027m just not going home.\" At which point, a somewhat rotund gentleman with a smooth, pink face and fluffy white sideburns (much like pictures of Martin Van Buren) stepped in and said coldly, \"Good day.\" \"Father,\" said Billikan, Senior. \"Grandfather,\" said Billikan, Junior. Billikan, Grandsenior, looked at Billikan, Junior, with disapproval. \"If you are my grandson,\" he said, \"you\u0027ve aged considerably and the change has not improved you.\" Billikan, Junior, smiled with dyspeptic feebleness, and made no answer. Billikan, Grandsenior, did not seem to require one. He said, \"Now if you two will bring me up to date on the business, I will resume my managerial function.\" There were two simultaneous answers, and Billikan, Grandsenior\u0027s, florid-ity waxed dangerously as he beat the ground peremptorily with an imaginary cane and barked a retort. R.E. said, \"Gentlemen.\" He raised his voice. \"Gentlemen!\" He shrieked at full long-power, \"GENTLEMEN!\" Conversation snapped off sharply and all turned to look at him. R.E.\u0027s angular face, his oddly attractive eyes, his sardonic mouth seemed suddenly to dominate the gathering. He said, \"I don\u0027t understand this argument. What is it that you manufacture?\" \"Bitsies,\" said Billikan, Junior. \"Which, I take it, are a packaged cereal breakfast food-\" \"Teeming with energy in every golden, crispy flake-\" cried Billikan, Junior. \"Covered with honey-sweet, crystalline sugar; a confection and a food- growled Billikan, Senior. \"To tempt the most jaded appetite,\" roared Billikan, Grandsenior. \"Exactly,\" said R.E. \"What appetite?\" They stared stolidly at him. \"I beg your pardon,\" said Billikan, Junior. \"Are any of you hungry?\" asked R.E. \"I\u0027m not.\" \"What is this fool maundering about?\" demanded Billikan, Grandsenior, angrily. His invisible cane would have been prodding R.E. in the navel had it (the cane, not the navel) existed. R.E. said, \"I\u0027m trying to tell you that no one will ever eat again. It is the hereafter, and food is unnecessary.\" The expressions on the faces of the Billikans needed no interpretation. It was obvious that they had tried their own appetites and found them wanting. Billikan, Junior, said ashenly, \"Ruined!\" Billikan, Grandsenior, pounded the floor heavily and noiselessly with his imaginary cane. \"This is confiscation of property without due process of law. I\u0027ll sue. I\u0027ll sue.\" \"Quite unconstitutional,\" agreed Billikan, Senior. \"If you can find anyone to sue, I wish you all good fortune,\" said R.E. agreeably. \"And now if you\u0027ll excuse me I think I\u0027ll walk toward the graveyard.\" He put his hat on his head and walked out the door. Etheriel, his vortices quivering, stood before the glory of a six-winged cherub. The cherub said, \"If I understand you, your particular universe has been dismantled.\" \"Exactly.\" \"Well, surely, now, you don\u0027t expect me to set it up again?\" \"I don\u0027t expect you to do anything,\" said Etheriel, \"except to arrange an appointment for me with the Chief.\" The cherub gestured his respect instantly at hearing the word. Two wing-tips covered his feet, two his eyes and two his mouth. He restored himself to normal and said, \"The Chief is quite busy. There are a myriad score of matters for him to decide.\" \"Who denies that? I merely point out that if matters stand as they are now, there will have been a universe in which Satan will have won the final victory.\" \"Satan?\" \"It\u0027s the Hebrew word for Adversary,\" said Etheriel impatiently. I could say Ahriman, which is the Persian word. In any case, I mean the Adversary.\" The cherub said, \"But what will an interview with the Chief accomplish? The document authorizing the Last Trump was countersigned by the Chief, and you know that it is irrevocable for that reason. The Chief would never limit his own omnipotence by canceling a word he had spoken in his official capacity.\" \"Is that final? You will not arrange an appointment?\" \"I cannot.\" Etheriel said, \"In that case, 1 shall seek out the Chief without one. I will invade the Primum Mobile. If it means my destruction, so be it.\" He gathered his energies... The cherub murmured in horror, \"Sacrilege!\" and there was a faint gathering of thunder as Etheriel sprang upward and was gone. R. E. Mann passed through the crowding streets and grew used to the sight of people bewildered, disbelieving, apathetic, in makeshift clothing or, usually, none at all. A girl, who looked about twelve, leaned over an iron gate, one foot on a crossbar, swinging it to and fro, and said as he passed, \"Hello, mister.\" \"Hello,\" said R.E. The girl was dressed. She was not one of the-uh- returnees. The girl said, \"We got a new baby in our house. She\u0027s a sister I once had. Mommy is crying and they sent me here.\" R.E. said, \"Well, well,\" passed through the gate and up the paved walk to the house, one with modest pretensions to middle-class gentility. He rang the bell, obtained no answer, opened the door and walked in. He followed the sound of sobbing and knocked at an inner door. A stout man of about fifty with little hair and a comfortable supply of cheek and chin looked out at him with mingled astonishment and resentment. \"Who are you?\" R.E. removed his hat. \"I thought I might be able to help. Your little girl outside-\" A woman looked up at him hopelessly from a chair by a double bed. Her hair was beginning to gray. Her face was puffed and unsightly with weeping and the veins stood out bluely on the back of her hands. A baby lay on the bed, plump and naked. It kicked its feet languidly and its sightless baby eyes turned aimlessly here and there. \"This is my baby,\" said the woman. \"She was born twenty-three years ago in this house and she died when she was ten days old in this house. I wanted her back so much.\" \"And now you have her,\" said R.E. \"But it\u0027s too late,\" cried the woman vehemently. \"I\u0027ve had three other children. My oldest girl is married; my son is in the army. I\u0027m too old to have a baby now. And even if-even if-\" Her features worked in a heroic effort to keep back the tears and failed. Her husband said with flat tonelessness, \"It\u0027s not a real baby. It doesn\u0027t cry. It doesn\u0027t soil itself. It won\u0027t take milk. What will we do? It\u0027ll never grow. It\u0027ll always be a baby.\" R.E. shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I\u0027m afraid I can do nothing to help.\" Quietly he left. Quietly he thought of the hospitals. Thousands of babies must be appearing at each one. Place them in racks, he thought, sardonically. Stack them like cordwood. They need no care. Their little bodies are merely each the custodian of an indestructible spark of life. He passed two little boys of apparently equal chronological age, perhaps ten. Their voices were shrill. The body of one glistened white in the sunless light so he was a returnee. The other was not. R.E. paused to listen. The bare one said, \"I had scarlet fever.\" A spark of envy at the other\u0027s claim to notoriety seemed to enter the clothed one\u0027s voice. \"Gee.\" \"That\u0027s why I died.\" \"Gee. Did they use pensillun or auromysim?\" \"What?\" \"They\u0027re medicines.\" \"I never heard of them.\" \"Boy, you never heard of much.\" \"I know as much as you.\" \"Yeah? Who\u0027s President of the United States?\" \"Warren Harding, that\u0027s who.\" \"You\u0027re crazy. It\u0027s Eisenhower.\" \"Who\u0027s he?\" \"Ever see television?\" \"What\u0027s that?\" The clothed boy hooted earsplittingly. \"It\u0027s something you turn on and see comedians, movies, cowboys, rocket rangers, anything you want.\" \"Let\u0027s see it.\" There was a pause and the boy from the present said, \"It ain\u0027t working.\" The other boy shrieked his scorn. \"You mean it ain\u0027t never worked. You made it all up.\" f. R.E. shrugged and passed on. The crowds thinned as he left town and neared the cemetery. Those who were left were all walking into town, all were nude. A man stopped him; a cheerful man with pinkish skin and white hair who had the marks of pince-nez on either side of the bridge of his nose, but no glasses to go with them. \"Greetings, friend.\" \"Hello,\" said R.E. \"You\u0027re the first man with clothing that I\u0027ve seen. You were alive when the trumpet blew, I suppose.\" \"Yes, I was.\" \"Well, isn\u0027t this great? Isn\u0027t this joyous and delightful? Come rejoice with me.\" \"You like this, do you?\" said R.E.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-17.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
