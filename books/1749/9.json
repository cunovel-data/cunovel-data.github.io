However, we are plugged into Multivac right here by beam transmission. What Multivac says can be interpreted here and what we say is beamed directly to Multivac, so in a sense we\u0027re in its presence.\" Norman looked about. The machines within the room were all meaningless to him. \"Now let me explain, Mr. Muller,\" Paulson went on. \"Multivac already has most of the information it needs to decide all the elections, national, state and local. It needs only to check certain imponderable attitudes of mind and it will use you for that. We can\u0027t predict what questions it will ask, but they may not make much sense to you, or even to us. It may ask you how you feel about garbage disposal in your town; whether you favor central incinerators. It might ask you whether you have a doctor of your own or whether you make use of National Medicine, Inc. Do you understand?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Whatever it asks, you answer in your own words in any way you please. If you feel you must explain quite a bit, do so. Talk an hour, if necessary.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Now, one more thing. We will have to make use of some simple devices which will automatically record your blood pressure, heartbeat, skin conductivity and brain-wave pattern while you speak. The machinery will seem formidable, but it\u0027s all absolutely painless. You won\u0027t even know it\u0027s going on.\" The other two technicians were already busying themselves with smooth-gleaming apparatus on oiled wheels. Norman said, \"Is that to check on whether I\u0027m lying or not?\" \"Not at all, Mr. Muller. There\u0027s no question of lying. It\u0027s only a matter of emotional intensity. If the machine asks you your opinion of your child\u0027s school, you may say, \u0027I think it is overcrowded.\u0027 Those are only words. From the way your brain and heart and hormones and sweat glands work, Multivac can judge exactly how intensely you feel about the matter. It will understand your feelings better than you yourself.\" \"I never heard of this,\" said Norman. \"No, I\u0027m sure you didn\u0027t. Most of the details of Multivac\u0027s workings are top secret. For instance, when you leave, you will be asked to sign a paper swearing that you will never reveal the nature of the questions you were asked, the nature of your responses, what was done, or how it was done. The less is known about the Multivac, the less chance of attempted outside pressures upon the men who service it.\" He smiled grimly. \"Our lives are hard enough as it is.\" Norman nodded. \"I understand.\" \"And now would you like anything to eat or drink?\" \"No. Nothing right now.\" \"Do you have any questions?\" Norman shook his head. \"Then you tell us when you\u0027re ready.\" \"I\u0027m ready right now.\" \"You\u0027re certain?\" \"Quite.\" Paulson nodded, and raised his hand in a gesture to the others. They advanced with their frightening equipment, and Norman Muller felt his breath come a little quicker as he watched. The ordeal lasted nearly three hours, with one short break for coffee and an embarrassing session with a chamber pot. During all this time, Norman Muller remained encased in machinery. He was bone-weary at the close. He thought sardonically that his promise to reveal nothing of what had passed would be an easy one to keep. Already the questions were a hazy mishmash in his mind. Somehow he had thought Multivac would speak in a sepulchral, superhuman voice, resonant and echoing, but that, after all, was just an idea he had from seeing too many television shows, he now decided. The truth was distressingly undramatic. The questions were slips of a kind of metallic foil patterned with numerous punctures. A second machine converted the pattern into words and Paulson read the words to Norman, then gave him the question and let him read it for himself. Norman\u0027s answers were taken down by a recording machine, played back to Norman for confirmation, with emendations and added remarks also taken down. All that was fed into a pattern-making instrument and that, in turn, was radiated to Murtivac. The one question Norman could remember at the moment was an incongruously gossipy: \"What do you think of the price of eggs?\" Now it was over, and gently they removed the electrodes from various portions of his body, unwrapped the pulsating band from his upper arm, moved the machinery away. He stood up, drew a deep, shuddering breath and said, \"Is that all? Am I through?\" \"Not quite.\" Paulson hurried to him, smiling in reassuring fashion. \"We\u0027ll have to ask you to stay another hour.\" \"Why?\" asked Norman sharply. \"It will take that long for Multivac to weave its new data into the trillions of items it has. Thousands of elections are concerned, you know. It\u0027s very complicated. And it may be that an odd contest here or there, a comptroller-ship in Phoenix, Arizona, or some council seat in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, may be in doubt. In that case, Multivac may be compelled to ask you a deciding question or two.\" \"No,\" said Norman. \"I won\u0027t go through this again.\" \"It probably won\u0027t happen,\" Paulson said soothingly. \"It rarely does. But, just in case, you\u0027ll have to stay.\" A touch of steel, just a touch, entered his voice. \"You have no choice, you know. You must.\" Norman sat down wearily. He shrugged. Paulson said, \"We can\u0027t let you read a newspaper, but if you\u0027d care for a murder mystery, or if you\u0027d like to play chess, or if there\u0027s anything we can do for you to help pass the time, I wish you\u0027d mention it.\" \"It\u0027s all right. I\u0027ll just wait.\" They ushered him into a small room just next to the one in which he had been questioned. He let himself sink into a plastic-covered armchair and closed his eyes. As well as he could, he must wait out this final hour. He sat perfectly still and slowly the tension left him. His breathing grew less ragged and he could clasp his hands without being quite so conscious of the trembling of his fingers. Maybe there would be no questions. Maybe it was all over. If it were over, then the next thing would be torchlight processions and invitations to speak at all sorts of functions. The Voter of the Year! He, Norman Muller, ordinary clerk of a small department store in Bloomington, Indiana, who had neither been born great nor achieved greatness would be in the extraordinary position of having had greatness thrust upon him. The historians would speak soberly of the Muller Election of 2008. That would be its name, the Muller Election. The publicity, the better job, the flash flood of money that interested Sarah so much, occupied only a comer of his mind. It would all be welcome, of course. He couldn\u0027t refuse it. But at the moment something else was beginning to concern him. A latent patriotism was stirring. After all, he was representing the entire electorate. He was the focal point for them. He was, in his own person, for this one day, all of America! The door opened, snapping him to open-eyed attention. For a moment, his stomach constricted. Not more questions! But Paulson was smiling. \"That will be all, Mr. Muller.\" \"No more questions, sir?\" \"None needed. Everything was quite clear-cut. You will be escorted back to your home and then you will be a private citizen once more. Or as much so as the public will allow.\" \"Thank you. Thank you.\" Norman flushed and said, \"I wonder-who was elected?\" Paulson shook his head. \"That will have to wait for the official announcement. The rules are quite strict. We can\u0027t even tell you. You understand.\" \"Of course. Yes.\" Norman felt embarrassed. \"Secret service will have the necessary papers for you to sign.\" \"Yes.\" Suddenly, Norman Muller felt proud. It was on him now in full strength. He was proud. In this imperfect world, the sovereign citizens of the first and greatest Electronic Democracy had, through Norman Muller (through him!) exercised once again its free, untrammeled franchise. Gimmicks Three \"Come, come,\" said Shapur quite politely, considering that he was a demon. \"You are wasting my time. And your own, too, I might add, since you have only half an hour left.\" And his tail twitched. \"It\u0027s not dematerialization?\" asked Isidore Wellby thoughtfully. \"I have already said it is not,\" said Shapur. For the hundredth time, Wellby looked at the unbroken bronze that surrounded him on all sides. The demon had taken unholy pleasure (what other kind indeed?) in pointing out that the floor, ceiling and four walls were featureless, two-foot-thick slabs of bronze, welded seamlessly together. It was the ultimate locked room and Wellby had but another half hour to get out, while the demon watched with an expression of gathering anticipation. It has been ten years previously (to the day, naturally) that Isidore Wellby had signed up. \"We pay you in advance,\" said Shapur persuasively. \"Ten years of anything you want, within reason, and then you\u0027re a demon. You\u0027re one of us, with a new name of demonic potency, and many privileges beside. You\u0027ll hardly know you\u0027re damned. And if you don\u0027t sign, you may end up in the fire, anyway, just in the ordinary course of things. You never know... Here, look at me. I\u0027m not doing too badly. I signed up, had my ten years and here I am. Not bad.\" \"Why so anxious for me to sign then, if I might be damned anyway?\" asked Wellby. \"It\u0027s not so easy to recruit hell\u0027s cadre,\" said the demon, with a frank shrug that made the faint odor of sulfur dioxide in the air a trifle stronger. \"Everyone wishes to gamble on ending in Heaven. It\u0027s a poor gamble, but there it is. I think you \u0027re too sensible for that. But meanwhile we have more damned souls than we know what to do with and a growing shortage at the administrative end.\" Wellby, having just left the army and finding himself with nothing much to show for it but a limp and a farewell letter from a girl he somehow still loved, pricked his finger, and signed. Of course, he read the small print first. A certain amount of demonic power would be deposited to his account upon signature in blood. He would not know in detail how one manipulated those powers, or even the nature of all of them, but he would nevertheless find his wishes fulfilled in such a way that they would seem to have come about through perfectly normal mechanisms. Naturally, no wish might be fulfilled which would interfere with the higher aims and purposes of human history. Wellby had raised his eyebrows at that. Shapur coughed. \"A precaution imposed upon us by-uh-Above. You are reasonable. The limitation won\u0027t interfere with you.\" Wellby said, \"There seems to be a catch clause, too.\" \"A kind of one, yes. After all, we have to check your aptitude for the position. It states, as you see, that you will be required to perform a task for us at the conclusion of your ten years, one your demonic powers will make it quite possible for you to do. We can\u0027t tell you the nature of the task now, but you will have ten years to study the nature of your powers. Look upon the whole thing as an entrance qualification.\" \"And if 1 don\u0027t pass the test, what then?\" \"In that case,\" said the demon, \"you will be only an ordinary damned soul after all.\" And because he was a demon, his eyes glowed smokily at the thought and his clawed fingers twitched as though he felt them already deep in the other\u0027s vitals. But he added suavely, \"Come, now, the test will be a simple one. We would rather have you as cadre than as just another chore on our hands.\" Wellby, with sad thoughts of his unattainable loved one, cared little enough at that moment for what would happen after ten years and he signed. Yet the ten years passed quickly enough. Isidore Wellby was always reasonable, as the demon had predicted, and things worked well. Wellby accepted a position and because he was always at the right spot at the right time and always said the right thing to the right man, he was quickly promoted to a position of great authority. Investments he made invariably paid off and, what was more gratifying still, his girl came back to him most sincerely repentant and most satisfactorily adoring. His marriage was a happy one and was blessed with four children, two boys and two girls, all bright and reasonably well behaved. At the end of ten years, he was at the height of his authority, reputation and wealth, while his wife, if anything, had grown more beautiful as she had matured. And ten years (to the day, naturally) after the making of the compact, he woke to find himself, not in his bedroom, but in a horrible bronze chamber of the most appalling solidity, with no company other than an eager demon. \"You have only to get out, and you will be one of us,\" said Shapur. \"It can be done fairly and logically by using your demonic powers, provided you know exactly what it is you\u0027re doing. You should, by now.\" \"My wife and children will be very disturbed at my disappearance,\" said Wellby with the beginning of regrets. \"They will find your dead body,\" said the demon consolingly. \"You will seem to have died of a heart attack and you will have a beautiful funeral. The minister will consign you to Heaven and we will not disillusion him or those who listen to him. Now, come, Wellby, you have till noon.\" Wellby, having unconsciously steeled himself for this moment for ten years, was less panic-stricken than he might have been. He looked about speculatively. \"Is this room perfectly enclosed? No trick openings?\" \"No openings anywhere in the walls, floor or ceiling,\" said the demon, with a professional delight in his handiwork. \"Or at the boundaries of any of those surfaces, for that matter. Are you giving up?\" \"No, no. Just give me time.\" Wellby thought very hard. There seemed no sign of closeness in the room. There was even a feeling of moving air. The air might be entering the room by dematerializing across the walls. Perhaps the demon had entered by dematerialization and perhaps Wellby himself might leave in that manner. He asked. The demon grinned. \"Dematerialization is not one of your powers. Nor did I myself use it in entering.\" \"You\u0027re sure now?\" \"The room is my own creation,\" said the demon smugly, \"and especially constructed for you.\" \"And you entered from outside?\" \"I did.\" \"With reasonably demonic powers which I possess, too?\" \"Exactly. Come, let us be precise. You cannot move through matter but you can move in any dimension by a mere effort of will. You can move up, down, right, left, obliquely and so on, but you cannot move through matter in any way.\" Wellby kept on thinking, and Shapur kept on pointing out the utter immovable solidity of the bronze walls, floor and ceiling; their unbroken ultimacy. It seemed obvious to Wellby that Shapur, however much he might believe in the necessity for recruiting cadre, was barely restraining his demonic delight at possibly having an ordinary damned soul to amuse himself with. \"At least,\" said Wellby, with a sorrowful attempt at philosophy, \"I\u0027ll have ten happy years to look back on. Surely that\u0027s a consolation, even for a damned soul in hell.\" \"Not at all,\" said the demon. \"Hell would not be hell, if you were allowed consolations. Everything anyone gains on Earth by pacts with the devil, as in your case (or my own, for that matter), is exactly what one might have gained without such a pact if one had worked industriously and in full trust in-uh-Above. That is what makes all such bargains so truly demonic.\" And the demon laughed with a kind of cheerful howl. Wellby said indignantly, \"You mean my wife would have returned to me even if I had never signed your contract.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-9.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
