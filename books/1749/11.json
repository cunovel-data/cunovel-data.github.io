See?\"\n He rose to his feet and, standing on the desk, turned his back to Prentiss. What had seemed merely a shining black cuticle suddenly split and lifted. From underneath, two filmy, veined wings fluttered out.\n \"Oh, you can fly,\" said Prentiss.\n \"You\u0027re very foolish,\" said the elf contemptuously, \"not to realize I\u0027m too large for flight. But they are attractive, aren\u0027t they? How do you like the iridescence? The lepidoptera have disgusting wings in comparison. They\u0027re gaudy and indelicate. What\u0027s more they\u0027re always sticking out.\"\n \"The lepidoptera?\" Prentiss felt hopelessly confused.\n \"The butterfly clans. They\u0027re the proud ones. They were always letting humans see them so they could be admired. Very petty minds in a way. And that\u0027s why your legends always give fairies butterfly wings instead of beetle wings which are much more diaphanously beautiful. We\u0027ll give the lepidoptera what for when we get back, you and I.\"\n \"Now hold on-\"\n \"First think,\" said the elf, swaying back and forth in what looked like elfin ecstasy, \"our nightly revels on the fairy green will be a blaze of sparkling light from curlicues of neon tubing. We can cut loose the swarms of wasps we\u0027ve got hitched to our flying wagons and install internal-combustion motors instead. We can stop this business of curling up on leaves when it\u0027s time to sleep and build factories to manufacture decent mattresses. I tell you, we\u0027ll live... And the rest of them will eat dirt for having ordered me out.\"\n \"But I can\u0027t go with you,\" bleated Prentiss. \"I have responsibilities. I have a wife and kid. You wouldn\u0027t take a man away from his-his larva, would you?\"\n \"I\u0027m not cruel,\" said the elf. He turned his eyes full on Prentiss. \"I have an elfin soul. Still, what choice have I? I must have a man-brain for focusing purposes or I will accomplish nothing; and not all man-brains are suitable.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Great Oberon, creature. A man-brain isn\u0027t a passive thing of wood and stone. It must co-operate in order to be useful. And it can only co-operate by being fully aware of our own elfin ability to manipulate it. I can use your brain, for instance, but your wife\u0027s would be useless to me. It would take her years to understand who and what I am.\"\n Prentiss said, \"This is a damned insult. Are you telling me I believe in fairies? I\u0027ll have you know I\u0027m a complete rationalist.\"\n \"Are you? When I first revealed myself to you, you had a few feeble thoughts about dreams and hallucinations but you talked to me, you accepted me. Your wife would have screamed and gone into hysterics.\"\n Prentiss was silent. He could think of no answer.\n \"That\u0027s the trouble,\" said the elf despondently. \"Practically all you humans have forgotten about us since we left you. Your minds have closed; grown useless. To be sure, your larvae believe in your legends about the \u0027little folk,\u0027 but their brains are undeveloped and useful only for simple processes. When they mature, they lose belief. Frankly, I don\u0027t know what I would do if it weren\u0027t for you fantasy writers.\"\n \"What do you mean we fantasy writers?\"\n \"You are the few remaining adults who believe in the insect folk. You, Prentiss, most of all. You\u0027ve been a fantasy writer for twenty years.\"\n \"You\u0027re mad. I don\u0027t believe the things I write.\"\n \"You have to. You can\u0027t help it. I mean, while you\u0027re actually writing, you take the subject matter seriously. After a while your mind is just naturally cultivated into usefulness... But why argue. I have used you. You saw the light bulb brighten. So you see you must come with me.\"\n \"But I won\u0027t.\" Prentiss set his limbs stubbornly. \"Can you make me against my will?\"\n \"I could, but I might damage you, and I wouldn\u0027t want that. Suppose we say this. If you don\u0027t agree to come, I could focus a current of high-voltage electricity through your wife. It would be a revolting thing to have to do, but I understand your own people execute enemies of the state in that fashion, so that you would probably find the punishment less horrible than I do. I wouldn\u0027t want to seem brutal even to a man-thing.\"\n Prentiss grew conscious of the perspiration matting the short hairs on his temple.\n \"Wait,\" he said, \"don\u0027t do anything like that. Let\u0027s talk it over.\"\n The elf shot out his filmy wings, fluttered them and returned them to their case. \"Talk, talk, talk. It\u0027s tiring. Surely you have milk in the house. You\u0027re not a very thoughtful host or you would have offered me refreshment before this.\"\n Prentiss tried to bury the thought that came to him, to push it as far below the outer skin of his mind as he could. He said casually, \"I have something better than milk. Here, I\u0027ll get it for you.\"\n \"Stay where you are. Call to your wife. She\u0027ll bring it.\"\n \"But I don\u0027t want her to see you. It would frighten her.\"\n The elf said, \"You need feel no concern. I\u0027ll handle her so that she won\u0027t be the least disturbed.\"\n Prentiss lifted an arm.\n The elf said, \"Any attack you make on me will be far slower than the bolt of electricity that will strike your wife.\"\n Prentiss\u0027 arm dropped. He stepped to the door of his study.\n \"Blanche!\" he called down the stairs.\n Blanche was just visible in the living room, sitting woodenly in the armchair near the bookcase. She seemed to be asleep, open-eyed.\n Prentiss turned to the elf. \"Something\u0027s wrong with her.\"\n \"She\u0027s just in a state of sedation. She\u0027ll hear you. Tell her what to do.\"\n \"Blanche!\" he called again. \"Bring the container of eggnog and a small glass, will you?\"\n With no sign of animation other than that of bare movement, Blanche rose and disappeared from view.\n \"What is eggnog?\" asked the elf.\n Prentiss attempted enthusiasm. \"It is a compound of milk, sugar and eggs beaten to a delightful consistency. Milk alone is poor staff compared to it.\"\n Blanche entered with the eggnog. Her pretty face was expressionless. Her eyes turned toward the elf but lightened with no realization of the significance of the sight.\n \"Here, Jan,\" she said, and sat down in the old, leather-covered chair by the window, hands falling loosely to her lap.\n Prentiss watched her uneasily for a moment. \"Are you going to keep her here?\"\n \"She\u0027ll be easier to control... Well, aren\u0027t you going to offer me the eggnog?\"\n \"Oh, sure. Here!\"\n He poured the thick white liquid into the cocktail glass. He had prepared five milk bottles of it two nights before for the boys of the New York Fantasy Association and it had been mixed with a lavish hand, since fantasy writers notoriously like it so.\n The elf\u0027s antennae trembled violently.\n \"A heavenly aroma,\" he muttered.\n He wrapped the ends of his thin arms about the stem of the small glass and lifted it to his mouth. The liquid\u0027s level sank. When half was gone, he put it down and sighed, \"Oh, the loss to my people. What a creation! What a thing to exist! Our histories tell us that in ancient days an occasional lucky sprite managed to take the place of a man-larva at birth so that he might draw off the liquid fresh-made. I wonder if even those ever experienced anything like this.\"\n Prentiss said with a touch of professional interest, \"That\u0027s the idea behind this business of changelings, is it?\"\n \"Of course. The female man-creature has a great gift. Why not take advantage of it?\" The elf turned his eyes upon the rise and fall of Blanche\u0027s bosom and sighed again.\n Prentiss said (not too eager, now; don\u0027t give it away), \"Go ahead. Drink all you want.\"\n He, too, watched Blanche, waiting for signs of restoring animation, waiting for the beginnings of breakdown in the elf\u0027s control.\n The elf said, \"When is your larva returning from its place of instruction? I need him.\"\n \"Soon, soon,\" said Prentiss nervously. He looked at his wristwatch. Actually, Jan, Junior, would be back, yelling for a slab of cake and milk, in something like fifteen minutes.\n \"Fill \u0027er up,\" he said urgently. \"Fill \u0027er up.\"\n The elf sipped gaily. He said, \"Once the larva arrives, you can go.\"\n \"Go?\"\n \"Only to the library. You\u0027ll have to get volumes on electronics. I\u0027ll need the details on how to build television, telephones, all that. I\u0027ll need to have rules on wiring, instructions for constructing vacuum tubes. Details, Pren-tiss, details! We have tremendous tasks ahead of us. Oil drilling, gasoline refining, motors, scientific agriculture. We\u0027ll build a new Avalon, you and I. A technical one. A scientific fairyland. We will create a new world.\"\n \"Great!\" said Prentiss. \"Here, don\u0027t neglect your drink.\"\n \"You see. You are catching fire with the idea,\" said the elf. \"And you will be rewarded. You will have a dozen female man-things to yourself.\"\n Prentiss looked at Blanche automatically. No signs of hearing, but who could tell? He said, \"I\u0027d have no use for female man-th-for women, I mean.\"\n \"Come now,\" said the elf censoriously, \"be truthful. You men-things are well known to our folk as lecherous, bestial creatures. Mothers frightened their young for generations by threatening them with men-things... Young, ah!\" He lifted the glass of eggnog in the air and said, \"To my own young,\" and drained it.\n \"Fill \u0027er up,\" said Prentiss at once. \"Fill \u0027er up.\"\n The elf did so. He said, \"I\u0027ll have lots of children. I\u0027ll pick out the best of the coleoptresses and breed my line. I\u0027ll continue the mutation. Right now I\u0027m the only one, but when we have a dozen or fifty, I\u0027ll interbreed them and develop the race of the super-elf. A race of electro-ulp-electronic marvels and infinite future... If I could only drink more. Nectar! The original nectar!\"\n There was the sudden noise of a door being flung open and a young voice calling, \"Mom! Hey, Mom!\"\n The elf, his glossy eyes a little dimmed, said, \"Then we\u0027ll begin to take over the men-things. A few believe already; the rest we will-urp-teach. It will be the old days, but better; a more efficient elfhood, a tighter union.\"\n Jan, Junior\u0027s, voice was closer and tinged with impatience. \"Hey, Mom! Ain\u0027t you home?\"\n Prentiss felt his eyes popping with tension. Blanche sat rigid. The elf\u0027s speech was slightly thick, his balance a little unsteady. If Prentiss were going to risk it, now, now was the time.\n \"Sit back,\" said the elf peremptorily. \"You\u0027re being foolish. I knew there was alcohol in the eggnog from the moment you thought your ridiculous scheme. You men-things are very shifty. We elves have many proverbs about you. Fortunately, alcohol has little effect upon us. Now if you had tried catnip with just a touch of honey in it... Ah, here is the larva. How are you, little man-thing?\"\n The elf sat there, the goblet of eggnog halfway to his mandibles, while\n Jan, Junior, stood in the doorway. Jan, Junior\u0027s, ten-year-old face was moderately smeared with dirt, his hair was immoderately matted and there was a look of the utmost surprise in his gray eyes. His battered schoolbooks swayed from the end of the strap he held in his hand.\n He said, \"Pop! What\u0027s the matter with Mom? And-and what\u0027s that?\"\n The elf said to Prentiss, \"Hurry to the library. No time must be lost. You know the books I need.\" All trace of incipient drunkenness had left the creature and Prentiss\u0027 morale broke. The creature had been playing with him.\n Prentiss got up to go.\n The elf said, \"And nothing human; nothing sneaky; no tricks. Your wife is still a hostage. I can use the larva\u0027s mind to kill her; it\u0027s good enough for that. I wouldn\u0027t want to do it. I\u0027m a member of the Elfitarian Ethical Society and we advocate considerate treatment of mammals so you may rely on my noble principles if you do as I say.\"\n Prentiss felt a strong compulsion to leave flooding him. He stumbled toward the door.\n Jan, Junior, cried, \"Pop, it can talk! He says he\u0027ll kill Mom! Hey, don\u0027t go away!\"\n Prentiss was already out of the room, when he heard the elf say, \"Don\u0027t stare at me, larva. I will not harm your mother if you do exactly as I say. I am an elf, a fairy. You know what a fairy is, of course.\"\n And Prentiss was at the front door when he heard Jan, Junior\u0027s, treble raised in wild shouting, followed by scream after scream in Blanche\u0027s shuddering soprano.\n The strong, though invisible, elastic that was drawing Prentiss out the house snapped and vanished. He fell backward, righted himself and darted back up the stairs.\n Blanche, fairly saturated with quivering life, was backed into a corner, her arms about a weeping Jan, Junior.\n On the desk was a collapsed black carapace, covering a nasty smear of pulpiness from which colorless liquid dripped.\n Jan, Junior, was sobbing hysterically, \"I hit it. I hit it with my school-books. It was hurting Mom.\"\n An hour passed and Prentiss felt the world of normality pouring back into the interstices left behind by the creature from Avalon. The elf itself was already ash in the incinerator behind the house and the only remnant of its existence was the damp stain at the foot of his desk.\n Blanche was still sickly pale. They talked in whispers.\n Prentiss said, \"How\u0027s Jan, Junior?\"\n \"He\u0027s watching television.\"\n \"Is he all right?\"\n \"Oh, he\u0027s all right, but I\u0027ll be having nightmares for weeks.\"\n \"I know. So will I unless we can get it out of our minds. I don\u0027t think there\u0027ll ever be another of those-things here.\"\n Blanche said, \"I can\u0027t explain how awful it was. I kept hearing every word he said, even when I was down in the living room.\"\n \"It was telepathy, you see.\"\n \"I just couldn\u0027t move. Then, after you left, I could begin to stir a bit. I tried to scream but all I could do was moan and whimper. Then Jan, Junior, smashed him and all at once I was free. I don\u0027t understand how it happened.\"\n Prentiss felt a certain gloomy satisfaction. \"I think I know. I was under his control because I accepted the truth of his existence. He held you in check through me. When I left the room, increasing distance made it harder to use my mind as a psychic lens and you could begin moving. By the time I reached the front door, the elf thought it was time to switch from my mind to Jan, Junior\u0027s. That was his mistake.\"\n \"In what way?\" asked Blanche.\n \"He assumed that all children believe in fairies, but he was wrong. Here in America today children don\u0027t believe in fairies. They never hear of them. They believe in Tom Corbett, in Hopalong Cassidy, in Dick Tracy, in Howdy Doody, in Superman and a dozen other things, but not in fairies.\n \"The elf just never realized the sudden cultural changes brought about by comic books and television, and when he tried to grab Jan, Junior\u0027s mind, he couldn\u0027t. Before he could recover his psychic balance, Jan, Junior, was on top of him in a swinging panic because he thought you were being hurt and it was all over.\n \"It\u0027s like I\u0027ve always said, Blanche. The ancient folk motifs of legend survive only in the modern fantasy magazine, and modem fantasy is purely adult fare. Do you finally see my point?\"\n Blanche said humbly, \"Yes, dear.\"\n Prentiss put his hands in his pockets and grinned slowly. \"You know, Blanche, next time I see Walt Rae, I think I\u0027ll just drop a hint that I write the stuff. Time the neighbors knew, I think.\"\n Jan, Junior, holding an enormous slice of buttered bread, wandered into his father\u0027s study in search of the dimming memory. Pop kept slapping him on the back and Mom kept putting bread and cake in his hands and he was forgetting why. There had been this big old thing on the desk that could talk...\n It had all happened so quickly that it got mixed up in his mind.\n He shrugged his shoulders and, in the late afternoon sunlight, looked at the partly typewritten sheet in his father\u0027s typewriter, then at the small pile of paper resting on the desk.\n He read a while, curled his lip and muttered, \"Gee whiz. Fairies again. Always kid stuff!\" and wandered off.\n The Watery Place\n We\u0027re never going to have space travel. What\u0027s more, no extraterrestrials will ever land on Earth-at least, any more.\n I\u0027m not just being a pessimist. As a matter of fact, space travel is possible; extraterrestrials have landed. I know that. Space ships are crisscrossing space among a million worlds, probably, but we\u0027ll never join them. I know that, too. All on account of a ridiculous error.\n I\u0027ll explain. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-11.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: \n Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
