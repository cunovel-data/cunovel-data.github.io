{"id":71113,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"It was actually Bart Cameron\u0027s error and you\u0027ll have to understand about Bart Cameron. He\u0027s the sheriff at Twin Gulch, Idaho, and I\u0027m his deputy. Bart Cameron is an impatient man and he gets most impatient when he has to work up his income tax. You see, besides being sheriff, he also owns and runs the general store, he\u0027s got some shares in a sheep ranch, he does a bit of assay work, he\u0027s got a kind of pension for being a disabled veteran (bad knee) and a few other things like that. Naturally, it makes his tax figures complicated.\\n\\n It wouldn\u0027t be so bad if he\u0027d let a tax man work on the forms with him, but he insists on doing it himself and it makes him a bitter man. By April 14, he isn\u0027t approachable.\\n\\n So it\u0027s too bad the flying saucer landed on April 14, 1956.\\n\\n I saw it land. My chair was backed up against the wall in the sheriff\u0027s office, and I was looking at the stars through the windows and feeling too lazy to go back to my magazine and wondering if I ought to knock off and hit the sack or keep on listening to Cameron curse real steady as he went over his columns of figures for the hundred twenty-seventh time.\\n\\n It looked like a shooting star at first, but then the track of light broadened into two things that looked like rocket exhausts and the thing came down sweet, steady and without a sound. An old, dead leaf would have rustled more coming down and landed thumpier. Two men got out.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t say anything or do anything. I couldn\u0027t choke or point; I couldn\u0027t even bug my eyes. I just sat there.\\n\\n Cameron? He never looked up.\\n\\n There was a knock on the door which wasn\u0027t locked. It opened and the two men from the flying saucer stepped in. I would have thought they were city fellows if I hadn\u0027t seen the flying saucer land in the scrub. They wore charcoal-gray suits, with white shirts and maroon four-in-hands. They had on black shoes and black homburgs. They had dark complexions, black wavy hair and brown eyes. They had very serious looks on their faces and were about five foot ten apiece. They looked very much alike.\\n\\n God, I was scared.\\n\\n But Cameron just looked up when the door opened and frowned. Ordinarily, I guess he\u0027d have laughed the collar button off his shirt at seeing clothes like that in Twin Gulch, but he was so taken up by his income tax that he never cracked a smile.\\n\\n He said, \"What can I do for you, folks?\" and he tapped his hand on the forms so it was obvious he hadn\u0027t much time.\\n\\n One of the two stepped forward. He said, \"We have had your people under observation a long time.\" He pronounced each word carefully and all by itself.\\n\\n Cameron said, \"My people? All I got\u0027s a wife. What\u0027s she been doing?\"\\n\\n The fellow in the suit said, \"We have chosen this locality for our first contact because it is isolated and peaceful. We know that you are the leader here.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m the sheriff, if that\u0027s what you mean, so spit it out. What\u0027s you trouble?\"\\n\\n \"We have been careful to adopt your mode of dress and even to assume your appearance.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s my mode of dress?\" He must have noticed it for the first time.\\n\\n \"The mode of dress of your dominant social class, that is. We have also learned your language.\"\\n\\n You could see the light break in on Cameron. He said, \"You guys foreigners?\" Cameron didn\u0027t go much for foreigners, never having met many outside the army, but generally he tried to be fair.\\n\\n The man from the saucer said, \"Foreigners? Indeed we are. We come from the watery place your people call Venus.\"\\n\\n (I was just collecting up strength to blink my eyes, but that sent me right back to nothing. I had seen the flying saucer. I had seen it land. I had to believe this! These men-or these somethings-came from Venus.)\\n\\n But Cameron never blinked an eye. He said, \"All right. This is the U.S.A. We all got equal rights regardless of race, creed, color, or nationality. I\u0027m at your service. What can I do for you?\"\\n\\n \"We would like to have you make immediate arrangements for the important men of your U.S.A., as you call it, to be brought here for discussions leading to your people joining our great organization.\"\\n\\n Slowly, Cameron got red. \"Our people join your organization. We\u0027re already part of the U.N. and God knows what else. And I suppose I\u0027m to get the President here, eh? Right now? In Twin Gulch? Send a hurry-up message?\" He looked at me, as though he wanted to see a smile on my face, but I couldn\u0027t as much as fall down if someone had pushed the chair out from under me.\\n\\n The saucer man said, \"Speed is desirable.\"\\n\\n \"You want Congress, too? The Supreme Court?\"\\n\\n \"If they will help, sheriff.\"\\n\\n And Cameron really went to pieces. He banged his income tax form and yelled, \"Well, you\u0027re not helping me, and I have no time for wise-guy jerks who come around, especially foreigners. If you don\u0027t get the hell out of here pronto, I\u0027ll lock you up for disturbing the peace and I\u0027ll never let you out.\"\\n\\n \"You wish us to leave?\" said the man from Venus.\\n\\n \"Right now! Get the hell out of here and back to wherever you\u0027re from and don\u0027t ever come back. I don\u0027t want to see you and no one else around here does.\"\\n\\n The two men looked at each other, making little twitches with their faces.\\n\\n Then the one who had done all the talking said, \"I can see in your mind that you really wish, with great intensity, to be left alone. It is not our way to force ourselves or our organization on people who do not wish us or it. We will respect your privacy and leave. We will not return. We will girdle your world in warning and none will enter and your people will never have to leave.\"\\n\\n Cameron said, \"Mister, I\u0027m tired of this crap, so I\u0027ll count to three-\"\\n\\n They turned and left, and I just knew that everything they said was so. I was listening to them, you see, which Cameron wasn\u0027t, because he was busy thinking of his income tax, and it was as though I could hear their minds, know what I mean? I knew that there would be a kind of fence around earth, corralling us in, keeping us from leaving, keeping others from coming 1 in. I knew it.\\n\\n And when they left, I got my voice back-too late. I screamed, \"Cameron, for God\u0027s sake, they\u0027re from space. Why\u0027d you send them away?\"\\n\\n \"From space!\" He stared at me.\\n\\n I yelled, \"Look!\" I don\u0027t know how I did it, he being twenty-five pounds heavier than I, but I yanked him to the window by his shirt collar, busting every shirt button off him.\\n\\n He was too surprised to resist and when he recovered his wits enough to make like he was going to knock me down, he caught sight of what was going on outside the window and the breath went out of him.\\n\\n They were getting into the flying saucer, those two men, and the saucer sat there, large, round, shiny and kind of powerful, you know. Then it took off. It went up easy as a feather and a red-orange glow showed up on one side and got brighter as the ship got smaller till it was a shooting star again, slowly fading out.\\n\\n And I said, \"Sheriff, why\u0027d you send them away? They had to see the President. Now they\u0027ll never come back.\"\\n\\n Cameron said, \"I thought they were foreigners. They said they had to learn our language. And they talked funny.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, fine. Foreigners.\"\\n\\n \"They said they were foreigners and they looked Italian. I thought they were Italian.\"\\n\\n \"How could they be Italian? They said they were from the planet Venus. I heard them. They said so.\"\\n\\n \"The planet Venus.\" His eyes got real round.\\n\\n \"They said it. They called it the watery place or something. You know Venus has a lot of water on it.\"\\n\\n But you see, it was just an error, a stupid error, the kind anyone could make. Only now Earth is never going to have space travel and we\u0027ll never as much as land on the moon or have another Venusian visit us. That dope, Cameron, and his income tax!\\n\\n Because he whispered, \"Venus! When they talked about the watery place, I thought they meant Venice!\"\\n\\n Living Space\\n\\n Clarence Rimbro had no objections to living in the only house on an uninhabited planet, any more than had any other of Earth\u0027s even trillion of inhabitants.\\n\\n If someone had questioned him concerning possible objections, he would undoubtedly have stared blankly at the questioner. His house was much larger than any house could possibly be on Earth proper and much more modern. It had its independent air supply and water supply, ample food in its freezing compartments. It was isolated from the lifeless planet on which it was located by a force field, but the rooms were built about a five-acre farm (under glass, of course), which, in the planet\u0027s beneficent sunlight, grew flowers for pleasure and vegetables for health. It even supported a few chickens. It gave Mrs. Rimbro something to do with herself afternoons, and a place for the two little Rimbros to play when they were tired of indoors.\\n\\n Furthermore, if one wanted to be on Earth proper; if one insisted on it; if one had to have people around and air one could breathe in the open or water to swim in, one had only to go out of the front door of the house.\\n\\n So where was the difficulty?\\n\\n Remember, too, that on the lifeless planet on which the Rimbro house was located there was complete silence except for the occasional monotonous effects of wind and rain. There was absolute privacy and the feeling of absolute ownership of two hundred million square miles of planetary surface.\\n\\n Clarence Rimbro appreciated all that in his distant way. He was an accountant, skilled in handling very advanced computer models, precise in his manners and clothing, not much given to smiling beneath his thin, well-kept mustache and properly aware of his own worth. When he drove from work toward home, he passed the occasional dwelling place on Earth proper and he never ceased to stare at them with a certain smugness.\\n\\n Well, either for business reasons or mental perversion, some people simply had to live on Earth proper. It was too bad for them. After all, Earth proper\u0027s soil had to supply the minerals and basic food supply for all the trillion of inhabitants (in fifty years, it would be two trillion) and space was at a premium. Houses on Earth proper just couldn\u0027t be any bigger than that, and people who had to live in them had to adjust to the fact.\\n\\n Even the process of entering his house had its mild pleasantness. He would enter the community twist place to which he was assigned (it looked, as did all such, like a rather stumpy obelisk), and there he would invariably find others waiting to use it. Still more would arrive before he reached the head of the line. It was a sociable time.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s your planet?\" \"How\u0027s yours?\" The usual small talk. Sometimes someone would be having trouble. Machinery breakdowns or serious weather that would alter the terrain unfavorably. Not often.\\n\\n But it passed the time. Then Rimbro would be at the head of the line; he would put his key into the slot; the proper combination would be punched; and he would be twisted into a new probability pattern; his own particular probability pattern; the one assigned to him when he married and became a producing citizen; a probability pattern in which life had never developed on Earth. And twisting to this particular lifeless Earth, he would walk into his own foyer.\\n\\n Just like that.\\n\\n He never worried about being in another probability. Why should he? He never gave it any thought. There were an infinite number of possible Earths. Each existed in its own niche; its own probability pattern. Since on a planet such as Earth there was, according to calculation, about a fifty-fifty chance of life\u0027s developing, half of all the possible Earths (still infinite, since half of infinity was infinity) possessed life, and half (still infinite) did not. And living on about three hundred billion of the unoccupied Earths were three hundred billion families, each with its own beautiful house, powered by the sun of that probability, and each securely at peace. The number of Earths so occupied grew by millions each day.\\n\\n And then one day, Rimbro came home and Sandra (his wife) said to him, as he entered, \"There\u0027s been the most peculiar noise.\"\\n\\n Rimbro\u0027s eyebrows shot up and he looked closely at his wife. Except for a certain restlessness of her thin hands and a pale look about the corners of her tight mouth, she looked normal.\\n\\n Rimbro said, still holding his topcoat halfway toward the servette that waited patiently for it, \"Noise? What noise? I don\u0027t hear anything.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s stopped now,\" Sandra said. \"Really, it was like a deep thumping or rumble. You\u0027d hear it a bit. Then it would stop. Then you\u0027d hear it a bit and so on. I\u0027ve never heard anything like it.\"\\n\\n Rimbro surrendered his coat. \"But that\u0027s quite impossible.\"\\n\\n \"I heard it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll look over the machinery,\" he mumbled. \"Something may be wrong.\"\\n\\n Nothing was, that his accountant\u0027s eyes could discover, and, with a shrug, he went to supper. He listened to the servettes hum busily about their different chores, watched one sweep up the plates and cutlery for disposal and recovery, then said, pursing his lips, \"Maybe one of the servettes is out of order. I\u0027ll check them.\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t anything like that, Clarence.\"\\n\\n Rimbro went to bed, without further concern over the matter, and wakened with his wife\u0027s hand clutching his shoulder. His hand went automatically to the contact patch that set the walls glowing. \"What\u0027s the matter? What time is it?\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"Listen! Listen!\"\\n\\n Good Lord, thought Rimbro, there is a noise. A definite rumbling. It came and went.\\n\\n \"Earthquake?\" he whispered. It did happen, of course, though, with all the planet to choose from, they could generally count on having avoided the faulted areas.\\n\\n \"All day long?\" asked Sandra fretfully. \"I think it\u0027s something else.\" And then she voiced the secret terror of every nervous householder. \"I think there\u0027s someone on the planet with us. This Earth is inhabited.\"\\n\\n Rimbro did the logical things. When morning came, he took his wife and children to his wife\u0027s mother. He himself took a day off and hurried to the Sector\u0027s Housing Bureau.\\n\\n He was quite annoyed at all his.\\n\\n Bill Ching of the Housing Bureau was short, jovial and proud of his part Mongolian ancestry. He thought probability patterns had solved every last one of humanity\u0027s problems. Alec Mishnoff, also of the Housing Bureau, thought probability patterns were a snare into which humanity had been hopelessly tempted. He had originally majored in archeology and had studied a variety of antiquarian subjects with which his delicately poised head was still crammed. His face managed to look sensitive despite overbearing eyebrows, and he lived with a pet notion that so far he had dared tell no one, though preoccupation with it had driven him out of archeology and into housing.\\n\\n Ching was fond of saying, \"The hell with Malthus!\" It was almost a verbal trademark of his. \"The hell with Malthus. We can\u0027t possibly overpopulate now. However frequently we double and redouble, Homo sapiens remains finite in number, and the uninhabited Earths remain infinite. And we don\u0027t have to put one house on each planet. We can put a hundred, a thousand, a million. Plenty of room and plenty of power from each probability sun.\"\\n\\n \"More than one on a planet?\" said Mishnoff sourly.\\n\\n Ching knew exactly what he meant. When probability patterns had first been put to use, sole ownership of a planet had been powerful inducement for early settlers. It appealed to the snob and despot in every one. What man so poor, ran the slogan, as not to have an empire larger than Genghis Khan\u0027s? To introduce multiple settling now would outrage everyone.\\n\\n Ching said, with a shrug, \"All right, it would take psychological preparation. So what? That\u0027s what it took to start the whole deal in the first place.\"\\n\\n \"And food?\" asked Mishnoff.\\n\\n \"You know we\u0027re putting hydroponic works and yeast plants in other probability patterns. And if we had to, we could cultivate their soil.\"\\n\\n \"Wearing space suits and importing oxygen.\"\\n\\n \"We could reduce carbon dioxide for oxygen till the plants got going and they\u0027d do the job after that.\"\\n\\n \"Given a million years.\"\\n\\n \"Mishnoff, the trouble with you,\" Ching said, \"is you read too many ancient history books. You\u0027re an obstructionist.\"\\n\\n But Ching was too good-natured really to mean that, and Mishnoff continued to read books and to worry. Mishnoff longed for the day he could get up the courage necessary to see the Head of the Section and put right out in plain view-bang, like that-exactly what it was that was troubling him.\\n\\n But now, a Mr. Clarence Rimbro faced them, perspiring slightly and toweringly angry at the fact that it had taken him the better part of two days to reach this far into the Bureau.\\n\\n He reached his exposition\u0027s climax by saying, \"And I say the planet is inhabited and I don\u0027t propose to stand for it.\"\\n\\n Having listened to his story in full, Ching tried the soothing approach. He said, \"Noise like that is probably just some natural phenomenon.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of natural phenomenon?\" demanded Rimbro. \"I want an investigation. If it\u0027s a natural phenomenon, I want to know what kind. I say the place is inhabited. It has life on it, by Heaven, and I\u0027m not paying rent on a planet to share it. And with dinosaurs, from the sound of it.\"\\n\\n \"Come, Mr. Rimbro, how long have you lived on your Earth?\"\\n\\n \"Fifteen and a half years.\"\\n\\n \"And has there ever been any evidence of life?\"\\n\\n \"There is now, and, as a citizen with a production record classified as A-I, I demand an investigation.\"\\n\\n \"Of course we\u0027ll investigate, sir, but we just want to assure you now that everything is all right. Do you realize how carefully we select our probability patterns?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m an accountant. I have a pretty good idea,\" said Rimbro at once.\\n\\n \"Then surely you know our computers cannot fail us. They never pick a probability which has been picked before. They can\u0027t possibly. And they\u0027re geared to select only probability patterns in which Earth has a carbon dioxide atmosphere, one in which plant life, and therefore animal life, has never developed. Because if plants had evolved, the carbon dioxide would have been reduced to oxygen. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n \"I understand it all very well and I\u0027m not here for lectures,\" said Rimbro. \"I want an investigation out of you and nothing else. It is quite humiliating to think I may be sharing my world, my own world, with something or other, and I don\u0027t propose to endure it.\"\\n\\n \"No, of course not,\" muttered Ching, avoiding Mishnoff\u0027s sardonic glance. \"We\u0027ll be there before night.\"\\n\\n They were on their way to the twisting place with full equipment.\\n\\n Mishnoff said, \"I want to ask you something. Why do you go through that There\u0027s no need to worry, sir\u0027 routine? They always worry anyway. Where does it get you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to try. They shouldn\u0027t worry,\" said Ching petulantly. \"Ever hear of a carbon dioxide planet that was inhabited? Besides, Rimbro is the type that starts rumors. I can spot them. By the time he\u0027s through, if he\u0027s encouraged, he\u0027ll say his sun went nova.\"\\n\\n \"That happens sometimes,\" said Mishnoff.\\n\\n \"So? One house is wiped out and one family dies. See, you\u0027re an obstructionist. In the old times, the times you like, if there were a flood in China or someplace, thousands of people would die. And that\u0027s out of a population of a measly billion or two.\"\\n\\n Mishnoff muttered, \"How do you know the Rimbro planet doesn\u0027t have life on it?\"\\n\\n \"Carbon dioxide atmosphere.\"\\n\\n \"But suppose-\" It was no use. Mishnoff couldn\u0027t say it. He finished lamely, \"Suppose plant and animal life develops that can live on carbon dioxide.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s never been observed.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-12.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
