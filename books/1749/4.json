He said sharply, \"Is this all?\"\n \"Gratitude, my boy, gratitude!\" Nimmo sat down with a grunt, and reached into a pocket for an apple.\n \"Oh, I\u0027m grateful, but it\u0027s so old.\"\n \"And lucky to get it at that. 1 tried to get a film run from the Congressional Library. No go. The book was restricted.\"\n \"Then how did you get this?\"\n \"Stole it.\" He was biting crunchingly around the core. \"New York Public.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Simple enough. I had access to the stacks, naturally. So I stepped over a chained railing when no one was around, dug this up, and walked out with it. They\u0027re very trusting out there. Meanwhile, they won\u0027t miss it in years... Only you\u0027d better not let anyone see it on you, nephew.\"\n Foster stared at the film as though it were literally hot.\n Nimmo discarded the core and reached for a second apple. \"Funny thing, now. There\u0027s nothing more recent in the whole field of neutrinics. Not a monograph, not a paper, not a progress note. Nothing since the chrono-scope.\"\n \"Uh-huh,\" said Foster absently.\n Foster worked evenings in the Potterley home. He could not trust his own on-campus rooms for the purpose. The evening work grew more real to him than his own grant applications. Sometimes he worried about it but then that stopped, too.\n His work consisted, at first, simply in viewing and reviewing the text film. Later it consisted in thinking (sometimes while a section of the book ran itself off through the pocket projector, disregarded).\n Sometimes Potterley would come down to watch, to sit with prim, eager eyes, as though he expected thought processes to solidify and become visible in all their convolutions. He interfered in only two ways. He did not allow Foster to smoke and sometimes he talked.\n It wasn\u0027t conversation talk, never that. Rather it was a low-voiced monologue with which, it seemed, he scarcely expected to command attention. It was much more as though he were relieving a pressure within himself.\n Carthage! Always Carthage!\n Carthage, the New York of the ancient Mediterranean. Carthage, commercial empire and queen of the seas. Carthage, all that Syracuse and Alexandria pretended to be. Carthage, maligned by her enemies and inarticulate in her own defense.\n She had been defeated once by Rome and then driven out of Sicily and Sardinia, but came back to more than recoup her losses by new dominions in Spain, and raised up Hannibal to give the Romans sixteen years of terror.\n In the end, she lost again a second time, reconciled herself to fate and built again with broken tools a limping life in shrunken territory, succeeding so well that jealous Rome deliberately forced a third war. And then Carthage, with nothing but bare hands and tenacity, built weapons and forced Rome into a two-year war that ended only with complete destruction of the city, the inhabitants throwing themselves into their flaming houses rather than surrender.\n \"Could people fight so for a city and a way of life as bad as the ancient writers painted it? Hannibal was a better general than any Roman and his soldiers were absolutely faithful to him. Even his bitterest enemies praised him. There was a Carthaginian. It is fashionable to say that he was an atypical Carthaginian, better than the others, a diamond placed in garbage. But then why was he so faithful to Carthage, even to his death after years of exile? They talk of Moloch-\"\n Foster didn\u0027t always listen but sometimes he couldn\u0027t help himself and he shuddered and turned sick at the bloody tale of child sacrifice.\n But Potterley went on earnestly, \"Just the same, it isn\u0027t true. It\u0027s a twenty-five-hundred-year-old canard started by the Greeks and Romans. They had their own slaves, their crucifixions and torture, their gladiatorial contests. They weren\u0027t holy. The Moloch story is what later ages would have called war propaganda, the big lie. I can prove it was a lie. I can prove it and, by Heaven, I will-I will-\"\n He would mumble that promise over and over again in his earnestness.\n Mrs. Potterley visited him also, but less frequently, usually on Tuesdays and Thursdays when Dr. Potterley himself had an evening course to take care of and was not present.\n She would sit quietly, scarcely talking, face slack and doughy, eyes blank, her whole attitude distant and withdrawn.\n The first time, Foster tried, uneasily, to suggest that she leave.\n She said tonelessly, \"Do I disturb you?\"\n \"No, of course not,\" lied Foster restlessly. \"It\u0027s just that-that-\" He couldn\u0027t complete the sentence.\n She nodded, as though accepting an invitation to stay. Then she opened a cloth bag she had brought with her and took out a quire of vitron sheets which she proceeded to weave together by rapid, delicate movements of a pair of slender, tetra-faceted depolarizers, whose battery-fed wires made her look as though she were holding a large spider.\n One evening, she said softly, \"My daughter, Laurel, is your age.\"\n Foster started, as much at the sudden unexpected sound of speech as at the words. He said, \"I didn\u0027t know you had a daughter, Mrs. Potterley.\"\n \"She died. Years ago.\"\n The vitron grew under the deft manipulations into the uneven shape of some garment Foster could not yet identify. There was nothing left for him to do but mutter inanely, \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n Mrs. Potterley sighed. \"I dream about her often.\" She raised her blue, distant eyes to him.\n Foster winced and looked away.\n Another evening she asked, pulling at one of the vitron sheets to loosen its gentle clinging to her dress, \"What is time viewing anyway?\"\n That remark broke into a particularly involved chain of thought, and Foster said snappishly, \"Dr. Potterley can explain.\"\n \"He\u0027s tried to. Oh, my, yes. But I think he\u0027s a little impatient with me. He calls it chronoscopy most of the time. Do you actually see things in the past, like the trimensionals? Or does it just make little dot patterns like the computer you use?\"\n Foster stared at his hand computer with distaste. It worked well enough, but every operation had to be manually controlled and the answers were obtained in code. Now if he could use the school computer... Well, why dream, he felt conspicuous enough, as it was, carrying a hand computer under his arm every evening as he left his office.\n He said, \"I\u0027ve never seen the chronoscope myself, but I\u0027m under the impression that you actually see pictures and hear sound.\"\n \"You can hear people talk, too?\"\n \"I think so.\" Then, half in desperation, \"Look here, Mrs. Potterley, this must be awfully dull for you. I realize you don\u0027t like to leave a guest all to himself, but really, Mrs. Potterley, you mustn\u0027t feel compelled-\"\n \"I don\u0027t feel compelled,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sitting here, waiting.\"\n \"Waiting? For what?\"\n She said composedly, \"I listened to you that first evening. The time you first spoke to Arnold. I listened at the door.\"\n He said, \"You did?\"\n \"I know I shouldn\u0027t have, but I was awfully worried about Arnold. I had a notion he was going to do something he oughtn\u0027t and I wanted to hear what. And then when I heard-\" She paused, bending close over the vitron and peering at it.\n \"Heard what, Mrs. Potterley?\"\n \"That you wouldn\u0027t build a chronoscope.\"\n \"Well, of course not.\"\n \"I thought maybe you might change your mind.\"\n Foster glared at her. \"Do you mean you\u0027re coming down here hoping I\u0027ll build a chronoscope, waiting for me to build one?\" I \"I hope you do, Dr. Foster. Oh, I hope you do.\"\n It was as though, all at once, a fuzzy veil had fallen off her face, leaving all her features clear and sharp, putting color into her cheeks, life into her eyes, the vibrations of something approaching excitement into her voice.\n \"Wouldn\u0027t it be wonderful,\" she whispered, \"to have one? People of the past could live again. Pharaohs and kings and-just people. I hope you build one, Dr. Foster. I really-hope-\"\n She choked, it seemed, on the intensity of her own words and let the vitron sheets slip off her lap. She rose and ran up the basement stairs, while Foster\u0027s eyes followed her awkwardly fleeing body with astonishment and distress.\n It cut deeper into Foster\u0027s nights and left him sleepless and painfully stiff with thought. It was almost a mental indigestion.\n His grant requests went limping in, finally, to Ralph Nimmo. He scarcely had any hope for them. He thought numbly: They won\u0027t be approved.\n If they weren\u0027t, of course, it would create a scandal in the department and probably mean his appointment at the university would not be renewed, come the end of the academic year.\n He scarcely worried. It was the neutrino, the neutrino, only the neutrino. Its trail curved and veered sharply and led him breathlessly along uncharted pathways that even Sterbinski and LaMarr did not follow.\n He called Nimmo. \"Uncle Ralph, I need a few things. I\u0027m calling from off the campus.\"\n Nimmo\u0027s face in the video plate was jovial, but his voice was sharp. He said, \"What you need is a course in communication. I\u0027m having a hell of a time pulling your application into one intelligible piece. If that\u0027s what you\u0027re calling about-\"\n Foster shook his head impatiently. \"That\u0027s not what I\u0027m calling about. I need these.\" He scribbled quickly on a piece of paper and held it up before the receiver.\n Nimmo yiped. \"Hey, how many tricks do you think I can wangle?\"\n \"You can get them, Uncle. You know you can.\"\n Nimmo reread the list of items with silent motions of his plump lips and looked grave.\n \"What happens when you put those things together?\" he asked. Foster shook his head. \"You\u0027ll have exclusive popular publication rights to whatever turns up, the way it\u0027s always been. But please don\u0027t ask any questions now.\"\n \"I can\u0027t do miracles, you know.\"\n \"Do this one. You\u0027ve got to. You\u0027re a science writer, not a research man. You don\u0027t have to account for anything. You\u0027ve got friends and connections.\n They can look the other way, can\u0027t they, to get a break from you next publication time?\"\n \"Your faith, nephew, is touching. I\u0027ll try.\"\n Nimmo succeeded. The material and equipment were brought over late one evening in a private touring car. Nimmo and Foster lugged it in with the grunting of men unused to manual labor.\n Potterley stood at the entrance of the basement after Nimmo had left. He asked softly, \"What\u0027s this for?\"\n Foster brushed the hair off his forehead and gently massaged a sprained wrist. He said, \"I want to conduct a few simple experiments.\"\n \"Really?\" The historian\u0027s eyes glittered with excitement.\n Foster felt exploited. He felt as though he were being led along a dangerous highway by the pull of pinching fingers on his nose; as though he could see the ruin clearly that lay in wait at the end of the path, yet walked eagerly and determinedly. Worst of all, he felt the compelling grip on his nose to be his own.\n It was Potterley who began it, Potterley who stood there now, gloating; but the compulsion was his own.\n Foster said sourly, \"I\u0027ll be wanting privacy now, Potterley. I can\u0027t have you and your wife running down here and annoying me.\"\n He thought: If that offends him, let him kick me out. Let him put an end to this.\n In his heart, though, he did not think being evicted would stop anything.\n But it did not come to that. Potterley was showing no signs of offense. His mild gaze was unchanged. He said, \"Of course, Dr. Foster, of course. All the privacy you wish.\"\n Foster watched him go. He was left still marching along the highway, perversely glad of it and hating himself for being glad.\n He took to sleeping over on a cot in Potterley\u0027s basement and spending his weekends there entirely.\n During that period, preliminary word came through that his grants (as doctored by Nimmo) had been approved. The Department Head brought the word and congratulated him.\n Foster stared back distantly and mumbled, \"Good. I\u0027m glad,\" with so little conviction that the other frowned and turned away without another word.\n Foster gave the matter no further thought. It was a minor point, worth no notice. He was planning something that really counted, a climactic test for that evening.\n One evening, a second and third and then, haggard and half beside himself with excitement, he called in Potterley.\n Potterley came down the stairs and looked about at the homemade gadgetry. He said, in his soft voice, \"The electric bills are quite high. I don\u0027t mind the expense, but the City may ask questions. Can anything be done?\"\n It was a warm evening, but Potterley wore a tight collar and a semijacket. Foster, who was in his undershirt, lifted bleary eyes and said shakily, \"It won\u0027t be for much longer, Dr. Potterley. I\u0027ve called you down to tell you something. A chronoscope can be built. A small one, of course, but it can be built.\"\n Potterley seized the railing. His body sagged. He managed a whisper. \"Can it be built here?\"\n \"Here in the basement,\" said Foster wearily.\n \"Good Lord. You said-\"\n \"I know what I said,\" cried Foster impatiently. \"I said it couldn\u0027t be done. I didn\u0027t know anything then. Even Sterbinski didn\u0027t know anything.\"\n Potterley shook his head. \"Are you sure? You\u0027re not mistaken, Dr. Foster? I couldn\u0027t endure it if-\"\n Foster said, \"I\u0027m not mistaken. Damn it, sir, if just theory had been enough, we could have had a time viewer over a hundred years ago, when the neutrino was first postulated. The trouble was, the original investigators considered it only a mysterious particle without mass or charge that could not be detected. It was just something to even up the bookkeeping and save the law of conservation of mass energy.\"\n He wasn\u0027t sure Potterley knew what he was talking about. He didn\u0027t care. He needed a breather. He had to get some of this out of his clotting thoughts... And he needed background for what he would have to tell Potterley next. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-4.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: \n Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
