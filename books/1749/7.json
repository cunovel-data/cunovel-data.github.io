He acted as though he were in trouble. He\u0027s my nephew. I had to try to get him off the spot. It took a while, then I came here to tell him what I had done. I told you when I got here, just after your man conked me that I had taken care of a few items.\"\n \"What? For Heaven\u0027s sake-\"\n \"Just this: I sent the details of the portable chronoscope off to half a dozen of my regular publicity outlets.\"\n Not a word. Not a sound. Not a breath. They were all past any demonstration.\n \"Don\u0027t stare like that,\" cried Nimmo. \"Don\u0027t you see my point? I had popular publication rights. Jonas will admit that. I knew he couldn\u0027t publish scientifically in any legal way. I was sure he was planning to publish illegally and was preparing the safety-deposit box for that reason, i thought if I put through the details prematurely, all the responsibility would be mine. His career would be saved. And if 1 were deprived of my science-writing license as a result, my exclusive possession of the chronometric data would set me up for life. Jonas would be angry, I expected that, but I could explain the motive and we would split the take fifty-fifty... Don\u0027t stare at me like that. How did I know-\"\n \"Nobody knew anything,\" said Araman bitterly, \"but you all just took it for granted that the government was stupidly bureaucratic, vicious, tyrannical, given to suppressing research for the hell of it. It never occurred to any of you that we were trying to protect mankind as best we could.\"\n \"Don\u0027t sit there talking,\" wailed Potterley. \"Get the names of the people who were told-\"\n \"Too late,\" said Nimmo, shrugging. \"They\u0027ve had better than a day. There\u0027s been time for the word to spread. My outfits will have called any number of physicists to check my data before going on with it and they\u0027ll call one another to pass on the news. Once scientists put neutrinics and pseudo-gravities together, home chronoscopy becomes obvious. Before the week is out, five hundred people will know how to build a small chronoscope and how will you catch them all?\" His plum cheeks sagged. \"I suppose there\u0027s no way of putting the mushroom cloud back into that nice, shiny uranium sphere.\"\n Araman stood up. \"We\u0027ll try, Potterley, but I agree with Nimmo. It\u0027s too late. What kind of a world we\u0027ll have from now on, I don\u0027t know, I can\u0027t tell, but the world we know has been destroyed completely. Until now, every custom, every habit, every tiniest way of life has always taken a certain amount of privacy for granted, but that\u0027s all gone now.\"\n He saluted each of the three with elaborate formality.\n \"You have created a new world among the three of you. I congratulate you. Happy goldfish bowl to you, to me, to everyone, and may each of you fry in hell forever. Arrest rescinded.\"\n The Foundation of S.F. Success\n (with apologies to W. S. Gilbert)\n If you ask me how to shine in the science-fiction line as a pro of luster bright,\n I say, practice up the lingo of the sciences, by jingo (never mind if not quite right).\n You must talk of Space and Galaxies and tesseractic fallacies in slick and mystic style,\n Though the fans won\u0027t understand it, they will all the same demand it with a softly hopeful smile.\n And all the fans will say,\n As you walk your spatial way,\n If that young man indulges in flights through all the Galaxy,\n Why, what a most imaginative type of man that type of man must be.\n So success is not a mystery, just brush up on your history, and borrow day by day.\n Take an Empire that was Roman and you\u0027ll find it is at home in all the starry Milky Way.\n With a drive that\u0027s hyperspatial, through the parsecs you will race, you\u0027ll find that plotting is a breeze,\n With a tiny bit of cribbin\u0027 from the works of Edward Gibbon and that Greek, Thucydides.\n And all the fans will say,\n As you walk your thoughtful way,\n If that young man involves himself in authentic history,\n Why, what a very learned kind of high IQ, his high IQ must be.\n Then eschew all thoughts of passion of a man-and-woman fashion from your hero\u0027s thoughtful mind.\n He must spend his time on politics, and thinking up his shady tricks, and outside that he\u0027s blind.\n It\u0027s enough he\u0027s had a mother, other females are a bother, though they\u0027re jeweled and glistery.\n They will just distract his dreaming and his necessary scheming with that psychohistory.\n And all the fans will say\n As you walk your narrow way,\n If all his yarns restrict themselves to masculinity,\n Why, what a most particularly pure young man that pure young man must be.\n Franchise\n LINDA, AGE ten, was the only one of the family who seemed to enjoy being awake.\n Norman Muller could hear her now through his own drugged, unhealthy coma. (He had finally managed to fall asleep an hour earlier but even then it was more like exhaustion than sleep.)\n She was at his bedside now, shaking him. \"Daddy, Daddy, wake up. Wake up!\"\n He suppressed a groan. \"All right, Linda.\"\n \"But, Daddy, there\u0027s more policemen around than any time! Police cars and everything!\"\n Norman Muller gave up and rose blearily to his elbows. The day was beginning. It was faintly stirring toward dawn outside, the germ of a miserable gray that looked about as miserably gray as he felt. He could hear Sarah, his wife, shuffling about breakfast duties in the kitchen. His father-in-law, Matthew, was hawking strenuously in the bathroom. No doubt Agent Handley was ready and waiting for him.\n This was the day.\n Election Day!\n To begin with, it had been like every other year. Maybe a little worse, because it was a presidential year, but no worse than other presidential years if it came to that.\n The politicians spoke about the guh-reat electorate and the vast electronic intelligence that was its servant. The press analyzed the situation with industrial computers (the New York Times and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch had their own computers) and were full of little hints as to what would be forthcoming. Commentators and columnists pinpointed the crucial state and county in happy contradiction to one another.\n The first hint that it would not be like every other year was when Sarah Muller said to her husband on the evening of October 4 (with Election Day exactly a month off), \"Cantwell Johnson says that Indiana will be the state this year. He\u0027s the fourth one. Just think, our state this time.\"\n Matthew Hortenweiler took his fleshy face from behind the paper, stared dourly at his daughter and growled, \"Those fellows are paid to tell lies. Don\u0027t listen to them.\"\n \"Four of them, Father,\" said Sarah mildly. \"They all say Indiana.\"\n \"Indiana is a key state, Matthew,\" said Norman, just as mildly, \"on account of the Hawkins-Smith Act and this mess in Indianapolis. It-\"\n Matthew twisted his old face alarmingly and rasped out, \"No one says Bloomington or Monroe County, do they?\"\n \"Well-\" said Norman.\n Linda, whose little pointed-chinned face had been shifting from one speaker to the next, said pipingly, \"You going to be voting this year, Daddy?\"\n Norman smiled gently and said, \"I don\u0027t think so, dear.\"\n But this was in the gradually growing excitement of an October in a presidential election year and Sarah had led a quiet life with dreams for her companions. She said longingly, \"Wouldn\u0027t that be wonderful, though?\"\n \"If I voted?\" Norman Muller had a small blond mustache that had given him a debonair quality in the young Sarah\u0027s eyes, but which, with gradual graying, had declined merely to lack of distinction. His forehead bore deepening lines born of uncertainty and, in general, he had never seduced his clerkly soul with the thought that he was either born great or would under any circumstances achieve greatness. He had a wife, a job and a little girl, and except under extraordinary conditions of elation or depression was inclined to consider that to be an adequate bargain struck with life.\n So he was a little embarrassed and more than a little uneasy at the direction his wife\u0027s thoughts were taking. \"Actually, my dear,\" he said, \"there are two hundred million people in the country, and, with odds like that, I don\u0027t think we ought to waste our time wondering about it.\"\n His wife said, \"Why, Norman, it\u0027s no such thing like two hundred million and you know it. In the first place, only people between twenty and sixty are eligible and it\u0027s always men, so that puts it down to maybe fifty million to one. Then, if it\u0027s really Indiana-\"\n \"Then it\u0027s about one and a quarter million to one. You wouldn\u0027t want me to bet in a horse race against those odds, now, would you? Let\u0027s have supper.\"\n Matthew muttered from behind his newspaper, \"Damned foolishness.\"\n Linda asked again, \"You going to be voting this year, Daddy?\"\n Norman shook his head and they all adjourned to the dining room.\n By October 20, Sarah\u0027s excitement was rising rapidly. Over the coffee, she announced that Mrs. Schultz, having a cousin who was the secretary of an Assemblyman, said that all the \"smart money\" was on Indiana.\n \"She says President Villers is even going to make a speech at Indianapolis.\"\n Norman Muller, who had had a hard day at the store, nudged the statement with a raising of eyebrows and let it go at that.\n Matthew Hortenweiler, who was chronically dissatisfied with Washington, said, \"If Villers makes a speech in Indiana, that means he thinks Multivac will pick Arizona. He wouldn\u0027t have the guts to go closer, the mush-head.\"\n Sarah, who ignored her father whenever she could decently do so, said, \"I don\u0027t know why they don\u0027t announce the state as soon as they can, and then the county and so on. Then the people who were eliminated could relax.\"\n \"If they did anything like that,\" pointed out Norman, \"the politicians would follow the announcements like vultures. By the time it was narrowed down to a township, you\u0027d have a Congressman or two at every street corner.\"\n Matthew narrowed his eyes and brushed angrily at his sparse, gray hair. \"They\u0027re vultures, anyhow. Listen-\"\n Sarah murmured, \"Now, Father-\"\n Matthew\u0027s voice rumbled over her protest without as much as a stumble or hitch. \"Listen, I was around when they set up Multivac. It would end partisan politics, they said. No more voters\u0027 money wasted on campaigns. No more grinning nobodies high-pressured and advertising-campaigned into Congress or the White House. So what happens. More campaigning than ever, only now they do it blind. They\u0027ll send guys to Indiana on account of the Hawkins-Smith Act and other guys to California in case it\u0027s the Joe Hammer situation that turns out crucial. I say, wipe out all that nonsense. Back to the good old-\"\n Linda asked suddenly, \"Don\u0027t you want Daddy to vote this year, Grandpa?\"\n Matthew glared at the young girl. \"Never you mind, now.\" He turned back to Norman and Sarah. \"There was a time I voted. Marched right up to the polling booth, stuck my fist on the levers and voted. There was nothing to it. I just said: This fellow\u0027s my man and I\u0027m voting for him. That\u0027s the way it should be.\"\n Linda said excitedly, \"You voted, Grandpa? You really did?\"\n Sarah leaned forward quickly to quiet what might easily become an incongruous story drifting about the neighborhood, \"It\u0027s nothing, Linda. Grandpa doesn\u0027t really mean voted. Everyone did that kind of voting, your grandpa, too, but it wasn\u0027t really voting.\"\n Matthew roared, \"It wasn\u0027t when I was a little boy. I was twenty-two and I voted for Langley and it was real voting. My vote didn\u0027t count for much, maybe, but it was as good as anyone else\u0027s. Anyone else\u0027s. And no Multivac to-\"\n Norman interposed, \"All right, Linda, time for bed. And stop asking questions about voting. When you grow up, you\u0027ll understand all about it.\"\n He kissed her with antiseptic gentleness and she moved reluctantly out of range under maternal prodding and a promise that she might watch the bedside video till 9:15, if she was prompt about the bathing ritual.\n Linda said, \"Grandpa,\" and stood with her chin down and her hands behind her back until his newspaper lowered itself to the point where shaggy eyebrows and eyes, nested in fine wrinkles, showed themselves. It was Friday, October 31.\n He said, \"Yes?\"\n Linda came closer and put both her forearms on one of the old man\u0027s knees so that he had to discard his newspaper altogether.\n She said, \"Grandpa, did you really once vote?\"\n He said, \"You heard me say I did, didn\u0027t you? Do you think I tell fibs?\"\n \"N-no, but Mamma says everybody voted then.\"\n \"So they did.\"\n \"But how could they? How could everybody vote?\"\n Matthew stared at her solemnly, then lifted her and put her on his knee.\n He even moderated the tonal qualities of his voice. He said, \"You see, Linda, till about forty years ago, everybody always voted. Say we wanted to decide who was to be the new President of the United States. The Democrats and Republicans would both nominate someone, and everybody would say who they wanted. When Election Day was over, they would count how many people wanted the Democrat and how many wanted the Republican. Whoever had more votes was elected. You see?\"\n Linda nodded and said, \"How did all the people know who to vote for? Did Multivac tell them?\"\n Matthew\u0027s eyebrows hunched down and he looked severe. \"They just used their own judgment, girl.\"\n She edged away from him, and he lowered his voice again, \"I\u0027m not angry at you, Linda. But, you see, sometimes it took all night to count what everyone said and people were impatient. So they invented special machines which could look at the first few votes and compare them with the votes from the same places in previous years. That way the machine could compute how the total vote would be and who would be elected. You see?\"\n She nodded. \"Like Multivac.\"\n \"The first computers were much smaller than Multivac. But the machines grew bigger and they could tell how the election would go from fewer and fewer votes. Then, at last, they built Multivac and it can tell from just one voter.\"\n Linda smiled at having reached a familiar part of the story and said, \"That\u0027s nice.\"\n Matthew frowned and said, \"No, it\u0027s not nice. I don\u0027t want a machine telling me how I would have voted just because some joker in Milwaukee says he\u0027s against higher tariffs. Maybe I want to vote cockeyed just for the pleasure of it. Maybe I don\u0027t want to vote. Maybe-\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/earth-is-room-enough/page-7.html","bookId":1749,"book":{"id":1749,"title":"Earth Is Room Enough","description":"Storyline: \n Earth Is Room Enough is a collection of fifteen short science fiction and fantasy stories and two pieces of comic verse published by Isaac Asimov in 1957.
