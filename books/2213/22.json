{"id":103033,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"21\n THE WIND swept the rocky field, the great centrifugal force dissolving and releasing those souls who struggled to be free of it at last as they assumed distinct human shape and pounded on the Gates of Hell, or wandered along the impossibly high walls, amid the flicker of fires within, reaching out for and imploring each other.\n All voices were lost in the sound of the wind. Souls in human shape fought and struggled, others roamed as if in search of something small and lost and then lifted their arms and let the whirlwind once again take hold of them.\n The shape of a woman, thin and pale, reached out to gather a wandering, weeping flock of baby souls, some not old enough yet to walk on two legs. The spirits of children wandered, crying piteously.\n We drew near the gates, near narrow broken arches rising as black and fine as onyx worked by medieval craftsmen. The air was filled with soft and bleating cries. Everywhere spirit hands reached to take hold of us; whispers covered us like the gnats and flies of the battlefield. Ghosts tore at my hair and coat.\n Help us, let us in, damn you, curse you, cursed, take me back, free me, I curse you forever, damn you, help me, help ... a rising roar of opprobrium.\n I struggled to clear the way for my eyes. Tender faces drifted before me, mouths issuing hot and mournful gasps against my skin.\n The gates weren\u0027t solid gates at all but gateways.\n And beyond stood the Helpful Dead, seemingly more solid, only more vividly colored and distinct, but diaphanous still, beckoning to the lost souls, calling to them by name, howling over the fierce wind that they must find the way inside, that this was not Perdition.\n Torches were held high; lamps burnt atop the walls. The sky was torn with streaks of lightning, and the great mystic shower of sparks that comes from cannons both modern and ancient. The smell of gunpowder and blood filled the air. Again and again the lights flared as if in some magical display to enchant a Chinese court of old, and then the blackness rolled back, thin and substanceless and cold all around us.\n \"Come inside,\" sang the Helpful Dead, the well-formed, well-proportioned ghosts\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;ghosts as determined as Roger had been, in garbs of all times and all nations, men and women, children, old ones, no body opaque, yet none weak, all reaching past us into the valley beyond, trying to assist the struggling, the cursing, the foundering.\n The Helpful Dead of India in their silk saris, of Egypt in cotton robes, of kingdoms long gone bequeathing jeweled and magnificent courtly garments; costumes of all the world, the feathered confections we call savage, the dark robes of priests, self-conceptions of all the world, from the crudest to the most magnificent.\n I clung to Memnoch. Was this beautiful, or was it not hideous, this throng of all nations and times? The naked, the black, the white, the Asian, those of all races, reaching out, moving with confidence through the lost and confused souls!\n The ground itself hurt my feet; blackened, rocky marl strewn with shells. Why this? Why?\n In all directions slopes rose or gently fell away, to run into sheer cliffs rising beyond or opening into chasms so deep and filled with smoky dissolving gloom they seemed the abyss itself.\n Doorways flickered and flashed with light; stairways wound precipitously up and down the stark, steep walls, leading out of sight, to vales I could only glimpse, or to gushing streams golden and steaming and red with blood.\n \"Memnoch, help me!\" I whispered. I dared not let go of the veil.\n I couldn\u0027t cover both ears. The howls were picking at my soul as if they were axes that could tear away pieces of it. \"Memnoch, this is unbearable!\"\n \"We will all help you,\" cried the Helpful Ghosts, a cluster of them closing in on all sides to kiss and to embrace me, their eyes wide with concern. \"Lestat has come. Lestat is here. Memnoch\u0027s brought him back. Come into Hell.\"\n Voices rose and fell and overlapped, as if a multitude said the Rosary, each from a different starting point, voices having become chant.\n \"We love you.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be afraid. We need you.\"\n \"Stay with us.\"\n \"Shorten our time.\"\n I felt their soft sweet soothing touch even as the lurid light terrified me, and the explosions blazed across the sky and the smell of smoke rose in my nostrils.\n \"Memnoch!\" I clung to his blackened hand as he pulled me along, his profile remote, his eyes seeming to sternly survey his kingdom.\n And there below us, as the mountain was cleft, lay the plains without\n end, covered with wandering and arguing dead, with the weeping and lost, and seeking, and afraid, with those being led and gathered and comforted by the Helpful Ghosts, and others running headlong as if they could escape, only to find themselves tumbling through the spirit multitudes, in hopeless circles.\n From where did this hellish light come, this magnificent and relentless illumination? Showers of sparks, sudden bursts of burning red, flames, comets arching over the peaks.\n Howls rose, echoing off the cliffs. Souls wailed and sang. The Helpful Dead rushed to aid the fallen to their feet, to usher those who would at last come to this or that stairs or gate or cave mouth or pathway.\n \"I curse Him, I curse Him, I curse Him!\" It echoed off the mountains and through the valleys.\n \"No justice, not after what was done!\"\n \"You cannot tell me....\"\n \"...someone has to make right....\"\n \"Come, I have your hand,\" Memnoch said, and on he walked, the same stern look on his face as he led me quickly down an echoing stairs, steep, dangerously narrow, and winding about the cliff.\n \"I can\u0027t bear this!\" I cried out. But my voice was snatched away. My right hand plunged into my coat again to feel the bulk of the veil, and then I reached out for the pitted and crumbling wall. Were these carvings in the rocks? Were these places where other hands had clawed or tried to climb? The screaming and the wails blotted out my reason. We had come again to yet another valley.\n Or was it a world, as vast and complex in its own right as Heaven? For here were myriad palaces and towers and arches as before, in colors of sombre brown, and burnt sienna, and ochre, and burnished if not blackened gold, and rooms filled with spirits of all ages and nations again, engaged in argument, discourse, struggle, or even song, some holding each other like newfound friends in the midst of woe, uniformed soldiers of ancient wars and modern wars, women in the shapeless draped black of the Holy Land, the souls of the modern world in their store-made finery now covered with dust and soot, so that all that blazed was muted in the blaze, as if no color could shine forth itself in its more baleful glory. They wept and patted each other\u0027s faces, and others nodded as they screamed their wrath, fists clenched.\n Souls in ragged monks\u0027 habits of coarse brown, nuns with the stiff white wimples intact, princes in puffed sleeves of velvet, naked men who walked as though they had never known clothes, dresses of gingham and old lace, of modern glittering silks and chemical fabrics sheer and thick, soldiers\u0027 olive green coats, or armour of gleaming bronze, peasants\u0027 tunics of crude cloth, or fine tailored wool suits of modern fashion, gowns of silver; hair of all colors tangled and mingled in the wind; faces of all colors; the old knelt with hands clasped, bald heads pink and tenderly wrinkled at the neck, and the thin white soulbodies of those who had starved in life drank out of the streams as dogs might do it, with their mouths, and others lay back, eyes half shut against the rocks and gnarled trees, singing and dreaming, and praying.\n My eyes grew more accustomed to the gloom with every second.\n More details leapt into my vision, more comprehension clarified each square inch or foot of what I beheld! For around each true soul, a dozen figures that danced or sang or wailed were no more than\n images projected from that soul and to that soul for it to commune with.\n The horrid figure of a woman consumed in flames was no more than a chimera for the howling souls who plunged into the fire, seeking to free her from the stake, to stamp out the flames that ate her, then rescue her from her unspeakable agony! It was the Witches Place. They were all burning! Save them! Oh, God, her hair is on fire!\n Indeed the soldiers stoking the cannon and covering their ears now as they made the shot were but an illusion for those true legions weeping on their knees, and a hulk of a giant wielding an ax was but a phantom for those who stared at him in recognition and stupification, seeing in him themselves.\n \"I cannot... I cannot look!\"\n Monstrous images of murder, torture, flashed before me so hot they burnt my face. Phantoms were dragged to their deaths in pots of boiling pitch, solders sank on their knees, eyes wide, a prince of some lost Persian kingdom screamed and leapt into the air, his arms out, his black eyes full of reflected fire.\n The wails, the whispers, took on the urgency of protest, and question, and discovery. All around were particular voices if only one had the courage to hear, to pick the themes fine as steel thread from the raging dirge.\n \"Yes, yes, and I thought, and I knew\u0026iexcl;\u0026shy;\"\n \"... my darlings, my little ones ...\"\n \"... into your arms, because you didn\u0027t, you never . ..\"\n \"... and I all the time I thought and you .. .\" \"Love you, love you, love you, yes, and always ...and no, you didn\u0027t know. You didn\u0027t know, you didn\u0027t know.\"\n \"...and always thought that it was what I should, but I knew, I felt...\"\n \"... the courage to turn and say that it wasn\u0027t. ..\"\n \"We didn\u0027t know! We didn\u0027t know.\"\n It was blended finally into that one incessant cry.\n We Did Not Know!\n Before me the wall of a mosque rose, crowded with those screaming and covering their heads as the plaster came down upon them, the roar of the artillery deafening. Phantoms all.\n We didn\u0027t know, we didn\u0027t know, the voices of the souls wailed. The Helpful Dead gathered on their knees, tears streaming down their faces ... \"Yes, we understand, you understand.\"\n \"And that year, just to go home then and be with ...\"\n \"Yes.. .\"\n I fell forward, my foot striking a rock, and pitching me into the middle of a swarm of soldiers on their hands and knees, weeping as they clutched at one another and the wraithlike phantoms of the conquered, the slain, the starved, all rocking and crying together in one voice.\n There came a chain of explosions, each more violent than the one before, such as only the modern world can make. The sky was light as day if day could be colorless and merciless and then dissolve into flickering darkness.\n Darkness Visible.\n \"Help, help me out of this,\" I cried, but they didn\u0027t seem to hear or notice my screams, and when I looked for Memnoch, I saw only a pair of elevator doors slide open suddenly, and before me loomed a great modern room full of elaborate chandeliers and buffed floors and carpets without end. The hard polished glitter of our machine-made world. Roger came running towards me.\n Roger, in all his dandified finery of purple silk jacket and tightly tailored pants, of perfumed hair, and manicured hands.\n \"Lestat,\" he cried. \"Terry is here, they are here. Lestat.\" He clung to my coat, the very eyes I\u0027d seen in the ghost and in the human in my arms, staring at me, breath on my face, the room dissolving into smoke, the dim spirit of Terry with her bright bottle-blond hair, throwing her arms about his neck, her face open with amazement, her pink lips speechless, Memnoch\u0027s wing touching down, shutting me off from them, the floor cracking open.\n \"I wanted to tell him about the veil. ...\" I insisted. I struggled.\n Memnoch held me.\n \"This way!\"\n The heavens opened with another fiery shower of sparks and the clouds burst above, clashing together, the lightning touching down over our heads, and on came a thunderous deluge of cold and chilling rain.\n \"Oh God, oh, God, oh God!\" I cried. \"This cannot be your school! God! I say no!\"\n \"Look, look!\"\n He pointed to the figure of Roger on his hands and knees, turning like a dog, amongst those he\u0027d slain, men imploring him with outstretched arms, women tearing open the cloth of their dresses to show the wounds, the chatter of voices rising perilously as if the sound of Hell itself would suddenly explode, and Terry\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the very same Terry-with her arms still around his neck. Roger lay on the ground, his shirt torn open, his feet naked, the jungle rising around him. Shots rang out in the dark. Crack of automatic guns spitting their numberless fatal bullets in unstinted fury. The lights of a house flickered among vines, amid monstrous trees. Roger turned to me, trying to rise, sinking back on his leg, crying, the tears streaming down his face.\n \"... and each and every act, in its own way, Lestat, and I didn\u0027t know ... I didn\u0027t know....\"\n Distinct and ghastly and demanding, he rose before me only to recede into the countless others.\n In all directions I saw them. The others.\n Scenario lapping into scenario, ashen colors brightening, or dying in a murky haze, and rising here and there from the horrid furious turbulent fields of Hell, the Purified Souls. There came the beat of drums, there came the piercing shrieks of some unendurable torture; a mass of men in crude white robes shoved into the blazing logs, their arms appealing to the souls who shrank and howled and screamed in remorse, in awful recognition.\n \"My God, my God, we are both forgiven!\"\n What was this sudden whirl of the filthy, stinking wind? Upward souls went with arms out, garments suddenly stripped or faded away into the indistinguishable robes of the Saved, the Tunnel opening.\n I saw the Light, saw the myriad spirits flying loose up the Tunnel towards the celestial blaze, the Tunnel perfectly round, and widening as they rose and for one blessed moment, one blessed tiny instant, the songs of Heaven resounded down the tunnel as if its curves were not made of wind but of something solid that could echo these ethereal songs, and their organized rhythm, their heartbreaking beauty piercing the catastrophic suffering of this place.\n \"I didn\u0027t know, I didn\u0027t know!\" The voices rose. The Tunnel closed.\n I stumbled, turning this way and that. Here soldiers tortured a young woman with their spears, while others wept and sought to throw themselves between her writhing form and her tormentors. Here babies ran on chubby legs with little hands outstretched to be gathered in the arms of weeping fathers, mothers, murderers.\n And pinned to the ground, his body covered in armour, his beard long and red, his mouth open in a howl, lay one cursing God cursing the Devil and cursing all Fate. \"7 will not, I will not, I will not!\"\n \"And who stands behind those doors,\" said a sombre Helpful Ghost, her beautiful hair shimmering around her in ethereal whiteness, her soft hand on my face. \"See there\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;\" The double doors about to open, the walls lined with books. \"Your dead, my beloved, your dead, all those you\u0027ve killed!\"\n I stared at the soldier on his back, roaring from his red-bearded mouth, \"Never, never will I say it was right, never, never....\"\n \"Not my dead,\" I cried. I turned and ran. I stumbled and fell again on my face in the soft press of bodies. Beyond, the ruins of a city withered in fire; walls crumbled on all sides, the cannon exploded again, and once more, a noxious gas filled the air, people fell coughing and choking for breath, the chorus of I DID NOT KNOW blended all in one instant of order that was worse than none!\n \"HELP ME!\" I cried and cried. I never knew such release in screaming, such pure and abandoned cowardice, to shout to High Heaven in this Godforsaken place where cries were the very air itself, and no one heard, no one but the smiling Helpful Dead.\n \"Learn, my dearest.\"\n \"Learn.\" Whispers like kisses. A wraith, an Indian man, turbaned head, darkened face. \"Learn, my young one.\"\n \"Look up, see the blossoms, see the sky. ...\" A Helpful Ghost danced in circles, her white dress passing in and out of the clouds and spurts of soot and filth, her feet sinking into the marl but turning still with certainty.\n \"Don\u0027t fool me, there is no garden here!\" I shouted. I was on my knees. My clothes were torn, but in my shirt I had the veil! I bad it.\n \"Take my hands....\"\n \"No, let me go!\" I slipped my hand in my coat to cover the veil. Staggering towards me a dim figure rose, hand outstretched, \"You, you cursed boy, you filthy boy, you in the Paris streets, like Lucifer Himself full of golden light, you! Think what you did to me!\"\n The tavern took form, the boy falling backwards from the blow of my mortal fist, the barrels going over and the growl of the disheveled and drunken men who closed in on me.\n \"No, stop it,\" I roared. \"Get him away from me. I don\u0027t remember him. I never killed him. I don\u0027t remember, I tell you, I can\u0027t....\n \"Claudia, where are you? Where are you, the one I wronged! Claudia! Nicolas, help me!\"\n But were they here, lost in this torrent, or gone, long gone through the Tunnel to the blazing glory above, to the blessed songs that wove the silence into their very chords and melodies? Pray gone, pray there, above.\n My own cries had lost all dignity and yet how defiant they sounded in my own ears. \"Help me, someone! Help!\"\n \"Must you die first to serve me?\" Memnoch asked. He rose before me, the granite angel of darkness, wings outstretched. Oh yes, blot out the horrors of Hell, please, even in this most monstrous of forms! \"You scream in Hell as you sang in Heaven. This is my kingdom, this is our work. Remember the Light!\"\n I fell back on my shoulder, hurting my left arm, but refusing to pull my right hand free of the veil. I saw the blue sky above in a flash and the peach blossoms blowing from the green leaves of the tree even as the luscious fruit itself clung to the branches.\n Smoke stung my eyes. A woman on her knees said to me:\n \"I know now that no one can forgive me but myself, but how could I have done those things to her, and she so small, how could I....\"\n \"I thought it was the other things,\" whispered a young girl who had hold of my neck, her nose touching mine as she spoke, \"but you know that kindness, that just holding his hand and he....\"\n \"Forgive!\" Memnoch said, and parted the way, gently pushing the souls aside. But the crowd crushed in; pale figures raced over me as if towards a respite I couldn\u0027t see, or some source of alarm. \"Forgive!\" Memnoch whispered.\n He snatched up the monk covered with blood, his brown robes shredded, his feet blistered and burnt from deliberate fire. \"In your heart, the power!\" said Memnoch, \"Be better than Him, better than Him, set Him an example.\"\n \"I love... even Him....\" came the whisper from the soul\u0027s lips as it suddenly dissolved. \"Yes, He couldn\u0027t have meant for us to suffer so... He couldn\u0027t.\"\n \"Did he pass the test!\" I demanded. \"Did that soul pass muster in this hellish place, what he just said? Was that enough! Ignorance of God, was that enough! Or is he here scrambling somewhere else in all this filth, or did the Tunnel take him up! Memnoch! Help me.\"\n Everywhere, I looked for the monk with the burnt feet. I looked and looked.\n An explosion ripped the towers of the city and they tumbled. Was that the tolling of a bell! The huge mosque had collapsed. A man with a gun fired on those who fled. Veiled women cried out as they fell to the ground.\n Louder and louder pealed the bell.\n \"Good God, Memnoch, a bell tolling, listen, more than one bell.\"\n \"The bells of Hell, Lestat, and they are not tolling for anyone! They are ringing for us, Lestat!\"\n He clutched my collar as if he\u0027d lift me off my feet.\n \"Remember, your own words, Lestat, Hell\u0027s Bells, you hear the call of Hell\u0027s Bells!\"\n \"No, let me go. I didn\u0027t know what I was saying. It was poetry. It was stupidity. Let me go. I can\u0027t stand it!\"\n Around the table under the lamp a dozen people argued over the map, some embracing each other as they pointed to various areas marked in dull colors. A head was turned. A man? A face. \"You!\"\n \"Let me go.\" I turned and was thrown against a wall of bookshelves, spines gleaming in the light, books tumbling, striking me on the shoulders, dear God, my limbs couldn\u0027t take any more. My fist went through the glittering globe of the world, mounted on its fancy arc of wood. A child with bent knees sat staring up at me with empty eye sockets.\n I saw the doorway and ran.\n \"No, let me go. I cannot. I will not. I will not.\"\n \"Will not?\" Memnoch caught me by my right arm, dark scowl looming over me, the wings flexing and rising, blotting out the light again as they closed to enfold me as though I were his own. \"Will you not help me to empty this place, to send these souls to Heaven?\"\n \"I can\u0027t do it!\" I cried. \"I won\u0027t do it!\" Suddenly my fury rose. I felt it obliterate all fear and trembling and doubt; I felt it rush through my veins like molten metal. The old anger, the resolve of Lestat. \"/ will not be pan of this, not for you, not for Him, not for them, not for anyone!\"\n I staggered backwards, glaring at him. \"No, not this. Not for a God as blind as He, and not for one who demands what you demand of me. You\u0027re mad, the two of you! I won\u0027t help you. I won\u0027t. I refuse.\"\n \"You would do this to me, you would abandon me?\" he cried, stricken, dark face convulsed with pain, tears shimmering on his shining black cheeks. \"You would leave me with this, and not lift your hands to help me after all that you have done, Cain, slayer of Brothers, slayer of the Innocents, you cannot help me\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;?\"\n \"Stop it, stop it. I won\u0027t. I can\u0027t support this. I can\u0027t help this to happen! I cannot create this! I cannot endure it! I cannot teach in this school!\"\n My throat was hoarse and burning, and the din seemed to swallow my words but he heard them.\n \"No, no, I will not, not this fabric, not these rules, not this design, never, never, never!\"\n \"Coward,\" he roared, the almond-shaped eyes immense, the fire flickering on the hard black forehead and cheeks. \"I have your soul in my hands, I hand you your salvation at a price that those who have suffered here for millennia would beg for!\"\n \"Not me. I won\u0027t be part of this pain, no, not now, not ever... Go to Him, change the rules, make it make sense, make it better, but not this, this is beyond human endurance, this is unfair, unfair, unfair, this is unconscionable.\"\n \"This is Hell, you fool! What did you expect? That you\u0027d serve the Lord of Hell while suffering nothing?\"\n \"I won\u0027t do it to them!\" I screamed. \"To hell with you and with me.\" My teeth were clenched. I seethed and stormed with my own conviction. \"I will not participate in this with them! Don\u0027t you see? I cannot accept this! I cannot commit to it. I cannot abide it. I\u0027m leaving you now, you gave me the choice, I\u0027m going home! Release me!\"\n I turned.\n He grabbed my arm again and this time the fury in me knew no bounds. I hurled him backwards over the dissolving and tumbling souls. The Helpful Dead turned here and there to witness and cry out, their pale oval faces full of alarm and distress.\n \"You go now,\" Memnoch swore, even as he lay still on the ground where I had thrown him. \"And as God is my witness you come back my pupil and my student on your knees at death, and never again this offer to make you my prince, my helper!\"\n I froze, staring over my shoulder at him, at his fallen figure, his elbow digging into the soft black underdown of his wing as he rose to his cloven feet and came at me again, in that hobbled monstrous walk.\n \"Do you hear me!\"\n \"I cannot serve you!\" I roared at the top of my lungs. \"I cannot do it.\"\n Then I turned for the last time, knowing I would not look back, with only one thought in my mind, Escape! I ran and ran, sliding down the loose marl and the slippery bank, and stomping through the shallow streams and through the clumps of astonished Helpful Dead, and over wailing souls.\n \"Where is the stairs? Where are the gates? You can\u0027t deny it to me. You have no right. Death has not taken me!\" I shouted but I never looked back and I never stopped running.\n \"Dora! David, help me!\" I called.\n And there came Memnoch\u0027s voice almost at my ear. \"Lestat, don\u0027t do this thing, don\u0027t go. Don\u0027t return. Lestat, don\u0027t do it, it\u0027s folly, don\u0027t you see, please, for the love of God, if you can love Him at all and love them, help me!\"\n \"NO!\" I turned and gave him a great shove, seeing him stumble backwards down the steep stairs, the dazed figure amid the huge fluttering wings awkward and grotesque. I pivoted, turning my back on him. Ahead, I could see the light at the very top, the open door.\n I ran for it.\n \"Stop him!\" Memnoch cried. \"Don\u0027t let him out. Don\u0027t let him take the veil with him.\"\n \"He has Veronica\u0027s veil!\" cried one of the Helpful Dead lunging at me through the gloom.\n My foot nearly slipped, yet on I ran, step after step, bounding, legs aching. I could feel them closing in, the Helpful Dead.\n \"Stop him.\"\n \"Don\u0027t let him go!\"\n \"Stop him!\"\n \"Get the veil from him,\" Memnoch cried, \"inside his shirt, the veil, the veil must not go with him!\"\n I waved my left hand, driving the Helpful Dead in a soft shapeless clatter against the cliff. High above loomed the door. I could see the light. I could see the light and I knew it was the light of Earth, brilliant and natural.\n Memnoch\u0027s hands clamped on my shoulders and he spun me around.\n \"No, you don\u0027t!\" I snarled. \"God forgive me. You forgive me, but you\u0027re not taking me or the veil!\" I roared.\n I raised my left arm to stave off his reaching, clawing hands, and shoved him again, but against me he flew as if his wings now came to his aid, and he almost pressed me back against the steps. I felt his fingers plunge into my left eye! I felt them drive open the lids, smashing my eye back into my head in an explosion of pain, and then the gelatinous mass slipped down my cheek, through my trembling fingers.\n I heard Memnoch gasp.\n \"Oh no....\" he wailed, his fingers to his lips, staring in horror at the same object at which I stared.\n My eye, my round blue eye, shivering and gleaming on the stair.\n All the Helpful Dead stared at the eye.\n \"Step on it, crush it,\" cried one of the Helpful Dead and rushed forward. \"Yes, crush it, step on it, smear it!\" cried another, swooping down upon the sight.\n \"No, don\u0027t do that, don\u0027t! Stop, all of you!\" Memnoch wailed.\n \"Not in my kingdom, you will not!\"\n \"Step on the eye!\"\n That was my moment, that was my chance.\n I flew upwards, feet scarcely touching the steps, I felt my head and shoulders plunge through the light and the silence and into the snow.\n And I was free.\n I WAS on earth. My feet struck the frozen ground, the slippery sludge of snow.\n I was running, one-eyed and bleeding, with the veil in my shirt, running through the driving storm, through the drifts of snow, my cries echoing up the buildings I knew, the dark, obdurate skyscrapers of the city I knew. Home, Earth.\n The sun had only just set behind the dark gray veil of the descending storm, the winter twilight eaten up in darkness by the whiteness of the snow.\n \"Dora, Dora, Dora!\"\n On and on I ran.\n Shadowy mortals slouched through the storm; shadowy humans hurried through small slippery paths, automobiles crawled through the blizzard, beams searching the rising, collecting whiteness. The snow was in such thick drifts that I fell and then scrambled to my knees; yet on I went.\n The arches and the spires of St. Patrick\u0027s rose before me.\n St. Patrick\u0027s.\n And beyond, the wall of the Olympic Tower driving upwards, its glass like polished stone, seemingly invincible, its height monstrous as if like the Tower of Babel it was trying to reach directly to Heaven.\n I stopped, my heart about to burst.\n \"Dora! Dora!\"\n I reached the doors of the lobby, the dizzying lights, the slick floors, the press of mortals, solid mortals everywhere, turning to see what moved too swiftly to be seen. Woozy music and lulling lights, the gush of artificial warmth!\n I found the stairwell and rose like a cinder going up a chimney in my flight, and crashed through the wooden door of the apartment, staggering into the room.\n Dora.\n I saw her, smelled her, smelled the blood from between her legs again, saw her tender little face, white and stricken, and on either side of her like goblins out of nursery rhymes and tales of hell, Armand and David, vampires, monsters, both staring at me in the same stark wonder.\n I struggled to open the left eye that was no longer there, then turned my head this way and that to see the three of them distinctly with the one eye, the right eye, that I still had. I could feel a sharp tiny pain like so many needles in the empty tissues where my left eye had been.\n Oh, the horror on Armand\u0027s face. In his old finery, he stood, heavy shopwindow velvet coat, modern lace, boots spiffed like glass. His face, the Botticelli angel still, torn with pain as he looked at me.\n And David, the pity, the sympathy. Both figures transfixed in one, the elder Englishman and the young fine body into which he\u0027d been locked, smothered in the tweed and cashmere garments of winter.\n Monsters clothed as men but earthbound, real!\n And the shining gamine figure of my Dora, my slender, yearning Dora with her huge black eyes.\n \"Darling, darling,\" Dora cried, \"I am here!\" Her small warm arms went round my aching shoulders, oblivious to the snow falling from my hair, from my clothes. I went down on my knees, my face buried in her skirts, near to the blood between her legs, the blood of the living womb, the blood of Earth, the blood of Dora that the body could give, and then I fell backwards onto the floor.\n I could neither speak nor move. I felt her lips touch mine.\n \"You\u0027re safe now, Lestat,\" she said.\n Or was it David\u0027s voice?\n \"You\u0027re with us,\" she said.\n Or was it Armand?\n \"We\u0027re here.\"\n \"Look, look at his feet. He\u0027s got only one shoe left.\"\n \"...at his coat, torn... the buttons are gone.\"\n \"Darling, darling.\" She kissed me.\n I rolled her over gently, careful not to press her with my weight, and I pulled up her skirt, and I lay my face against her hot naked thighs. The smell of the blood flooded my brain.\n \"Forgive me, forgive me,\" I whispered, and my tongue broke through the thin cotton of her panties, tearing the cloth back from the soft down of pubic hair, pushing aside the bloodstained pad she wore, and I lapped at the blood just inside her young pink vaginal lips, just coming from the mouth of her womb, not pure blood, but blood from her, blood from her strong, young body, blood all over the tight hot cells of her vaginal flesh, blood that brought no pain, no sacrifice, only her gentle forbearance with me, with my unspeakable act, my tongue going deep into her, drawing out the blood that was yet to come, gently, gently, lapping the blood from the soft hair on her pubic lips, sucking each tiny droplet of it.\n Unclean, unclean. They cried on the road to Golgotha, when Veronica had said: \"Lord, I touched the hem of your garment and my hemorrhage was healed.\" Unclean, unclean.\n \"Unclean, thank God, unclean,\" I whispered, my tongue licking at the secret bloodstained place, taste and smell of blood, her sweet blood, a place where blood flows free and no wound is made or ever needs to be made, the entrance to her blood open to me in her forgiveness.\n Snow beat against the glass. I could hear it, smell it, the blinding white snow of a terrible blizzard for New York, a deep white winter, freezing all beneath its mantle.\n \"My darling, my angel,\" she whispered.\n I lay panting against her. The blood was all gone inside me now. I had drawn all of it from her womb that was meant to come. I had licked away even what had collected on the pad that had lain against her skin.\n She sat up, modestly covering me with her crossed arms, bending forward as if to shield me from their eyes\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;David\u0027s, Armand\u0027s\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;never once having pushed at me, or cried out, or recoiled, and she held my head now as I cried.\n \"You\u0027re safe,\" she said again. They said we were safe. They all said Safe, as if it had a magic charm. Safe, safe, safe.\n \"Oh, no,\" I cried. I wept. \"No, none of us are safe. And we will never be, never, ever again, ever. ...\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-22.html","bookId":2213,"book":{"id":2213,"title":"Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5) \n The fifth volume of Rice\u0027s Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books. The tale begins in New York, where Lestat, the coolest of Rice\u0027s vampire heroes, is stalking a big-time cocaine dealer and religious-art smuggler--this guy should get it in the neck. Lestat is also growing fascinated with the dealer\u0027s lovely daughter, a TV evangelist who\u0027s not a fraud. Lestat is also being stalked himself, by some shadowy guy who turns out to be Memnoch, the devil, who spirits him away. From here on, the book might have been called Interview with the Devil (by a Vampire). It\u0027s a rousing story interrupted by a long debate with the devil. Memnoch isn\u0027t the devil as ordinarily conceived: he got the boot from God because he objected to God\u0027s heartless indifference to human misery. Memnoch takes Lestat to heaven, hell, and throughout history.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:25 PM"}}
