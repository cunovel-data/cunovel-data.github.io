{"id":103014,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"2 I REACHED his house on the Upper East Side before he did. I\u0027d tracked him here numerous times. I knew the routine. Hirelings lived on the lower and upper floors, though I don\u0027t think they knew who he was. It wasn\u0027t unlike a vampire\u0027s usual arrangement. And between those two flats was his long chain of rooms, the second story of the town house, barred like a prison, and accessible by him through a rear entrance. He never had a car let him out in front of the place. He\u0027d get out on Madison and cut deep into the block to his back door. Or sometimes he got out on Fifth. He had two routes, and some of the surrounding property was his. But nobody\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;none of his pursuers\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;knew of this place. I wasn\u0027t even sure that his daughter, Dora, knew the exact location. He\u0027d never brought her there in all the months I\u0027d been watching him, savoring and licking my lips over his life. And I\u0027d never caught from Dora\u0027s mind any distinct image of it. But Dora knew of his collection. In the past, she had accepted his relics. She had some of them scattered about the empty convent castle in New Orleans. I\u0027d sensed a glimmer or two of these fine things the night when I\u0027d pursued her there. And now my Victim was still lamenting that she\u0027d refused the latest gift. Something truly sacred, or so he thought. I got into the flat simply enough. One could hardly call it a flat, though it did include a small lavatory, dirty in the way barren, unused places become dirty, and then room after room was crammed with trunks, statues, bronze figures, heaps of seeming trash that no doubt concealed priceless discoveries. It felt very strange to be inside, concealed in the small rear room, because I had never done more than look through the windows. The place was cold. When he came, he would create heat and light simply enough. I sensed he was only halfway up Madison in a crush of traffic, and I began to explore. At once, a great marble statue of an angel startled me. I came round out of the door and almost ran smack into it. It was one of those angels that used to stand inside church doors, offering holy water in half shells. I had seen them in Europe and in New Orleans. It was gigantic, and its cruel profile stared blindly into the shadows. Far down the hall, the light came up from the busy little street that ran into Fifth. The usual New York songs of traffic were coming through the walls. This angel was poised as if he had just landed from the skies to offer his sacred basin. I slapped his bent knee gently and went around him. I didn\u0027t like him. I could smell parchment, papyrus, various kinds of metal. The room opposite appeared to be filled with Russian icons. The walls were veritably covered with them and the light was playing on the halos of the sad-eyed Virgins or glaring Christs. I went on to the next room. Crucifixes. I recognized the Spanish style, and what appeared to be Italian Baroque, and very early work which surely must have been very rare\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the Christ grotesque and poorly proportioned yet suffering with appropriate horror on the worm-eaten cross. Only now did I realize the obvious. It was all religious art. There was nothing that wasn\u0027t religious. But then it\u0027s rather easy to say that about all art from the end of the last century backwards, if you think about it. I mean, the great majority of art is religious. The place was utterly devoid of life. Indeed, it stank of insecticide. Of course, he had saturated it to save his old wooden statues, he would have had to do that. I could not hear or smell rats, or detect any living thing at all. The lower flat was empty of its occupants, though a small radio chattered the news in a bathroom. Easy to blot out that little sound. On the floors above, there were mortals, but they were old, and I caught a vision of a sedentary man, with earphones on his head, swaying to the rhythm of some esoteric German music, Wagner, doomed lovers deploring the \"hated dawn\" or some heavy, repetitive, and distinctly pagan foolishness. Leitmotiv be damned. There was another person up there, but she was too feeble to be of any concern, and I could catch only one image of her and she appeared to be sewing or knitting. I didn\u0027t care enough about any of this to bring it into loving focus. I was safe in the flat, and He\u0027d be coming soon, filling all these rooms with the perfume of his blood, and I\u0027d do my damnedest not to break his neck before I\u0027d had every drop. Yes, this was the night. Dora wouldn\u0027t find out until she got home tomorrow anyway. Who would know that I\u0027d left his corpse here? I went on into the living room. This was tolerably clean; the room where he relaxed and read and studied and fondled his objects. There were his comfortable bulky couches, fitted with heaps of pillows, and halogen lamps of black iron so delicate and light and modern and easy to maneuver that they looked like insects poised on tables and on the floor itself, and sometimes on top of cardboard boxes. The crystal ashtray was full of butts, which confirmed he preferred safety to cleanliness, and I saw scattered glasses in which the liquor had long ago dried to a glaze that was now flaked like lacquer. Thin, rather frowsy drapes hung over the windows, making the light soiled and tantalizing. Even this room was jammed with statues of saints\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a very lurid and emotional St. Anthony holding a chubby Child Jesus in the crook of his arm; a very large and remote Virgin, obviously of Latin American origin. And some monstrous angelic being of black granite, which even with my eyes I could not fully examine in the gloom, something resembling more a Mesopotamian demon than an angel. For one split second this granite monster sent the shivers through me. It resembled ... no, I should say its wings made me think of the creature I\u0027d glimpsed, this Thing that I thought was following me. But I didn\u0027t hear any footsteps here. There was no rip in the fabric of the world. It was a statue of granite, that\u0027s all, a hideous ornament perhaps from some gruesome church full of images of Hell and Heaven. Lots of books lay on the tables. Ah, he did love books. I mean, there were the fine ones, made of vellum and very old and all that, but current books, too, titles in philosophy and religion, current affairs, memoirs of currently popular war correspondents, even a few volumes of poetry. Mircea Eliade, history of religions in various volumes, might have been Dora\u0027s gift, and there, a brand-new History of God, by a woman named Karen Armstrong. Something else on the meaning of life\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; Understanding the Present, by Bryan Appleyard. Hefty books. But fun, my kind, anyway. And the books had been handled. Yes, it was his scent on these books, heavily his scent, not Dora\u0027s. He had spent more time here than I ever realized. I scanned the shadows, the objects, I let the air fill my nostrils. Yes, he\u0027d come here often and with someone else, and that person... that person had died here! I hadn\u0027t realized any of this before, of course, and it was just more preparation for the meal. So the murderer drug dealer had loved a young man in these digs once, and it hadn\u0027t been all clutter. I was getting flashes of it in the worst way, more emotion than image, and I found myself fairly fragile under the onslaught. This death hadn\u0027t occurred all that long ago. Had I passed this Victim in those times, when his friend was dying, I would never have settled on him, just let him go on. But then he was so flashy! He was coming up the back steps now, the inner secret stairway, cautiously taking each step, his hand on the handle of his gun inside his coat, very Hollywood style, though there wasn\u0027t much else about him that was predictable. Except, of course, that many who deal in cocaine are eccentric. He reached the back door, saw that I\u0027d opened it. Rage. I slipped over into the corner opposite that overbearing granite statue, and I stood back between two dusty saints. There wasn\u0027t enough light for him to see me right off. He\u0027d have to turn on one of the little halogens, and they were spots. Right now, he listened, he sensed. He hated it that someone had broken open his door; he was murderous and had no intention of not investigating, alone; a little court case was held in his mind. No, no one could possibly know about this place, the judge decided. Had to be a petty thief, goddamn it, and those words were heaped in rage upon the accidental. He slipped the gun out, and he started going through his rooms, through rooms I\u0027d skipped. I heard the light switch, saw the flash in the hall. He went on to another and another. How on earth could he tell this place was empty? I mean, anyone could be hiding in this place. I knew it was empty. But what made him so sure? But maybe that\u0027s how he\u0027d stayed alive all this time, he had just the right mixture of creativity and carelessness. At last came the absolutely delicious moment. He was satisfied he was alone. He stepped into the living-room door, his back to the long hall, and slowly scanned the room, failing to see me, of course, and then he put his large nine-millimeter gun back in his shoulder holster, and he slipped off his gloves very slowly. There was enough light for me to note everything I adored about him. Soft black hair, the Asian face that you couldn\u0027t clearly identify as Indian or Japanese, or Gypsy; could even have been Italian or Greek; the cunning black eyes, and the remarkably perfect symmetry of the bones\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;one of the very few traits he\u0027d passed on to his daughter, Dora. She was fair skinned, Dora. Her mother must have been milk white. He was my favorite shade, caramel. Suddenly something made him very uneasy. He turned his back to me, eyes quite obviously locked to some object that had alarmed him. Nothing to do with me. I had touched nothing. But his alarm had thrown up a wall between my mind and his. He was on full alert, which meant he wasn\u0027t thinking sequentially. He was tall, his back very straight, the coat long, his shoes those Savile Row handmade kind that takes the English shops forever. He took a step away from me, and I realized immediately from a jumble of images that it was the black granite statue that had startled him. It was perfectly obvious. He didn\u0027t know what it was or how it had gotten here. He approached, very cautious, as though someone might be hiding in the vicinity of the thing, then pivoted, scanned the room, and slowly drew out his gun again. Possibilities were passing through his mind in rather orderly fashion. He knew one art dealer who was stupid enough to have delivered the thing and left the door unlocked, but that dealer would have called him before ever coming. And this thing? Mesopotamian? Assyrian? Suddenly, impulsively, he forgot all practical matters and put his hand out and touched the granite. God, he loved it. He loved it and he was acting stupid. I mean, there could have been one of his enemies here. But then why would a gangster or a federal investigator come bearing a gift such as that? Whatever the case, he was enthralled by the piece. I still couldn\u0027t see it clearly. I would have slipped off the violet glasses, which would have helped enormously, but I didn\u0027t dare move. I wanted to see this, this adoration of his for the object that was new. I could feel his uncompromising desire for this statue, to own it, to have it here ... the very sort of desire which had first attracted him to me. He was thinking only about it, the fine carving, that it was recent, not ancient, for obvious stylistic reasons, seventeenth century perhaps, a fleshed-out rendering of a fallen angel. Fallen angel. He did everything but step on tiptoe and kiss the thing. He put his left hand up and ran it all over the granite face and the granite hair. Damn, I couldn\u0027t see it! How could he put up with this darkness? But then he was smack up against it, and I was twenty feet away and stuffed between two saints, without a good perspective. Finally, he turned and switched on one of the halogen lamps. Thing looked like a preying mantis. He moved the thin black iron limb so the beam shone up on the statue\u0027s face. Now I could see both profiles beautifully! He made little noises of lust. This was unique! The dealer was of no importance, the back door forgiven, the supposed danger fled. He slipped the gun in the holster again, almost as if he wasn\u0027t even thinking about it, and he did go up on tiptoe, trying to get eye level with this appalling graven image. Feathered wings. I could see that now. Not reptilian, feathered. But the face, classical, robust, the long nose, the chin .. . yet there was a ferocity in the profile. And why was the statue black? Maybe it was only St. Michael pushing devils into hell, angry righteous. No, the hair was too rank and tangled for that. Armour, breastplate, and then of course I saw the most telling details. That it had the legs and feet of a goat. Devil. Again there came a shiver. Like the thing I\u0027d seen. But that was stupid! And I had no sense of the Stalker being near me now. No disorientation. I wasn\u0027t even really afraid. It was just a frisson, nothing more. I held very still. Now take your time, I thought. Figure this out. You\u0027ve got your Victim and this statue is just a coincidental detail that further enriches the entire scenario. He turned another halogen beam on the thing. It was almost erotic the way he studied it. I smiled. Erotic the way I was studying him\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;this forty-seven-year-old man with a youth\u0027s health and a criminal\u0027s poise. Fearlessly he stood back, having forgotten any threat of any kind, and looked at this new acquisition. Where had it come from? Whom? He didn\u0027t give a damn about the price. If only Dora. No, Dora wouldn\u0027t like this thing. Dora. Dora, who had cut him to the heart tonight refusing his gift. His entire posture changed; he didn\u0027t want to think about Dora again, and all the things Dora had said\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;that he had to renounce what he did, that she\u0027d never take another cent for the church, that she couldn\u0027t help but love him and suffer if he did go to court, that she didn\u0027t want the veil. What veil? Just a fake, he\u0027d said, but one of the best he\u0027d found so far. Veil? I suddenly connected his hot little memory with something hanging on the far wall, a framed bit of fabric, a painted Christface. Veil. Veronica\u0027s veil. And just an hour ago he\u0027d said to Dora, \"Thirteenth century, and so beautiful, Dora, for the love of heaven. Take it. If I can\u0027t leave these things to you, Dora....\" So this Christface had been his precious gift? \"I won\u0027t take them anymore, Daddy, I told you. I won\u0027t.\" He had pressed her with the vague scheme that this new gift could be exhibited for the public. So could all his relics. They could raise money for the church. She had started to cry, and all this had been going on back at the hotel, whilst David and I had been in the bar only yards from them. \"And say these bastards do manage to pick me up, some warrant, something I haven\u0027t covered, you\u0027re telling me you won\u0027t take these things? You\u0027ll let strangers take them?\" \"Stolen, Daddy,\" she had cried. \"They are not clean. They are tainted.\" He really could not understand his daughter. It seemed he\u0027d been a thief ever since he was a child. New Orleans. The boardinghouse, the curious mixture of poverty and elegance and his mother drunk most of the time. The old captain who ran the antique shop. All this was going through his mind. Old Captain had had the front rooms of the house, and he, my Victim, had brought the breakfast tray each morning to Old Captain, before going on to school. Boardinghouse, service, elegant oldsters, St. Charles Avenue. The time when the men sat on the galleries in the evening and the old ladies did, too, with their hats. Daylight times I\u0027d never know again. Such reverie. No, Dora wouldn\u0027t like this. And he wasn\u0027t so sure he did either, suddenly. He had standards which were often difficult to explain to people. He began some defense as though talking to the dealer who\u0027d brought this. \"It\u0027s beautiful, yes, but it\u0027s too Baroque! It lacks that element of distortion that I treasure.\" I smiled. I loved this guy\u0027s mind. And the smell of the blood, well. I took a deliberate breath of it, and let it turn me into a total predator. Go slowly, Lestat. You\u0027ve waited for months. Don\u0027t rush it. And he\u0027s such a monster himself. He\u0027d shot people in the head, killed them with knives. Once in a small grocery he had shot both his enemy and the proprietor\u0027s wife with utter indifference. Woman in the way. And he had coolly walked out. Those were early New York days, before Miami, before South America. But he remembered that murder, and that\u0027s why I knew about it. He thought a lot about those various deaths. That\u0027s why I thought about them. He was studying the hoofed feet of this thing, this angel, devil, demon. I realized its wings reached the ceiling. I could feel that shiver again if I let myself. But again, I was on firm ground, and there was nothing from any other realm in this place. He slipped off his coat now, and stood in shirtsleeves. That was too much. I could see the flesh of his neck, of course, as he opened his collar. I could see that particularly beautiful place right below his ear, that special measure between the back of the neck of a human and the lobe of his ear, which has so much to do with male beauty. Hell, I had not invented the significance of necks. Everyone knew what those proportions meant. He was all over pleasing to me, but it was the mind, really. To hell with his Asian beauty and all that, even his vanity which made him glow for fifty feet in all directions. It was the mind, the mind that was locked onto the statue, and had for one merciful moment let thoughts of Dora go. He reached for another one of the little halogen spots and clamped his hand over the hot metal and directed it hill on the demon\u0027s wing, the wing I could best see, and I too saw the perfection he was thinking about, the Baroque love of detail; no. He did not collect this sort of thing. His taste was for the grotesque, and this thing was only grotesque by accident. God, it was hideous. It had a ferocious mane of hair, and a scowl on its face that could have been designed by William Blake, and huge rounded eyes that fixed on him in seeming hatred. \"Blake, yes!\" he said suddenly. He turned around. \"Blake. The damned thing looks like one of those drawings by Blake.\" I realized he was staring at me. I had projected the thought, carelessly, yes, obviously with purpose. I felt a shock of connection. He saw me. He saw the glasses perhaps, and the light, or maybe my hair. Very slowly I stepped out, with my arms at my sides. I wanted nothing so vulgar as his reaching for his gun. But he hadn\u0027t reached for it. He merely looked at me, blinded perhaps by the bright little lights so near to him. The halogen beam threw the shadow of the angel\u0027s wing on the ceiling. I came closer. He said absolutely nothing. He was afraid. Or rather, let me say, he was alarmed. He was more than alarmed. He felt this might very well be his last confrontation. Someone had gotten by him totally! And it was too late to be reaching for guns, or doing anything so literal, and yet he wasn\u0027t actually in fear of me. Damned if he didn\u0027t know I wasn\u0027t human. I came swiftly towards him, and took his face in both my hands. He went into a sweat and tremble, naturally, yet he reached up and pulled the glasses off my eyes and they fell on the floor. \"Oh, it\u0027s gorgeous, finally,\" I whispered, \"to be so very close to you!\" He couldn\u0027t form words. No mortal in my grip like this could have been expected to utter anything but prayers, and he had no prayers! He stared right into my eyes, and then very slowly took my measure, not daring to move, his face still fixed in both my cold, cold hands, and he knew. Not human. It was the strangest reaction! Of course I\u0027d confronted recognition before, in lands the world over; but prayer, madness, some desperate atavistic response, something always accompanied it. Even in old Europe where they believed in the nosferatu, they\u0027d scream out a prayer before I sank my teeth. But this, what was this, his staring at me, this comical criminal courage! \"Going to die like you lived?\" I whispered. One thought galvanized him. Dora. He went into a violent struggle, grabbing at my hands, realizing they felt like stone, and then convulsing, as he tried to pull himself loose, held mercilessly by the face. He hissed at me. Some inexplicable mercy came over me. Don\u0027t torture him like this. He knows too much. Understands too much. God, you\u0027ve had months of watching him, you don\u0027t have to stretch this out. On the other hand, when will you find another kill like this one! Well, hunger overcame judgment. I pressed my forehead against his neck first, shifting my hand to the back of his head, let him feel my hair, heard him draw in his breath, and then I drank. I had him. I had the gush, and him and Old Captain in the front room, the streetcar crashing past outside, and him saying to Old Captain, \"You ever show it to me again or ask me to touch it and I won\u0027t ever come near you.\" And Old Captain swearing he never would. Old Captain taking him to the movies, and to dinner at the Monteleone, and on the plane to Atlanta, having vowed never to do it again, \"Just let me be around you, son, just let me be near you, I\u0027ll never, I swear.\" His mother drunk in the doorway, brushing her hair. \"I know your game, you and that old man, I know just what you\u0027re doing. He bought you those clothes? You think I don\u0027t know.\" And then Terry with the bullet hole in the middle of her face, a blond-haired girl turning to the side and crumpling to the floor, the fifth murder and it has to be you, Terry, you. He and Dora were in the truck. And Dora knew. Dora was only six and she knew. Knew he\u0027d shot her mother, Terry. And they\u0027d never, never spoken a word about it. Terry\u0027s body in a plastic sack. Ah, God, plastic. And him saying, \"Mommy\u0027s gone.\" Dora hadn\u0027t even asked. Six years old, she knew. Terry screaming, \"You think you can take my daughter from me, you son of a bitch, you think you can take my child, I\u0027m leaving tonight with Jake and she\u0027s going with me.\" Bang, you\u0027re dead, honey. I couldn\u0027t stand you anyway. In a heap on the floor, the very flashy cute kind of common girl with very oval pale pink nails, and lipstick that always looks extraordinarily fresh, and hair from a bottle. Pink shorts, little thighs. He and Dora driving in the night, and they never had spoken a word. What are you doing to me! You are killing me! You are taking my blood, not my soul, you thief, you... what in the name of God? \"You talking to me?\" I drew back, blood dripping from my lips, Good God, he was talking to me! I bit down again, and this time I did break his neck, but he wouldn\u0027t stop. Yes, you, what are you? Why, why this, the blood? Tell me, damn you into hell! Damn you! I had crushed the bones of his arms, twisted his shoulder out of the socket, the last blood I could get was there on my tongue. I stuck my tongue into the wound, give me, give me, give me.... But what, what is your name, under God, who are you? He was dead. I dropped him and stepped back. Talking to me! Talking to me during the kill? Asking me who / was? Piercing the swoon? \"Oh, you are so full of surprises,\" I whispered. I tried to clear my head. I was warmly full of blood. I let it stay in my mouth. I wanted to pick him up, tear open his wrist, drink anything that was left, but that was so ugly, and the truth was, I had no intention of touching him again! I swallowed and ran my tongue along my teeth, getting the last taste, he and Dora in the truck, she six years old, Mommy dead, shot in the head, with Daddy now forever. \"That was the fifth killing!\" he\u0027d said aloud to me, I\u0027d heard him. \"Who are you?\" \"Talking to me, you bastard!\" I looked down at him, ooh, the blood was just flooding my fingertips finally and moving down my legs; I closed my eyes, and I thought, Live for this, just for this, for this taste, this feeling, and his words came back to me, words to Dora in a fancy bar, \"I sold my soul for places like this.\" \"Oh, for Godsakes, die, damn it!\" I said. I wanted the blood to keep burning, but enough of him, hell, six months was plenty for a love affair between vampire and human! I looked up. The black thing wasn\u0027t a statue at all. It was alive. And it was studying me. It was living and breathing and watching me under its furious shining black scowl, looking down at me. \"No, not true,\" I said aloud. I tried to fall into the deep calm that danger often produces in me. Not true. I nudged his dead body on the floor deliberately just to be sure I was still there, and not going mad, and in terror of the disorientation, but it didn\u0027t come, and then I screamed. I screamed like any kid. And I ran out of there. I tore out of there, down the hall, out of the back and into the wide night. I went up over the rooftops, and then in sheer exhaustion slipped down in a narrow alley, and lay against the bricks. No, that couldn\u0027t have been true. That was some last image he projected, my Victim; he threw that image out in death, a sweet vengeance. Making that statue look alive, that big dark winged thing, that goat-legged.... \"Yeah,\" I said. I wiped my lips. I was lying in dirty snow. There were other mortals in this alley. Don\u0027t bother us. I won\u0027t. I wiped my lips again. \"Yeah, vengeance; all his love,\" I whispered aloud, \"for all the things in that place, and he threw that at me. He knew. He knew what I was. He knew how....\" And besides, the Thing that stalked me had never been so calm, so still, so reflective. It had always been swelling and rising like so much thick, stinking smoke and those voices ...That had been a mere statue standing there. I got up, furious with myself, absolutely furious for having fled, for having passed up the last little trick involved in the whole kill. I was furious enough to go back there, and kick his dead body and kick that statue, which no doubt returned to granite the instant that conscious life went completely out of the dying brain of its owner. Broken arms, shoulders. As if from the bloody heap I\u0027d made of him, he\u0027d called up that thing. And Dora will hear about this. Broken arms, shoulders. Neck broken. I went out onto Fifth Avenue. I walked into the wind. I stuffed my hands in the pockets of my wool blazer, which was far too light to look appropriate in this quiet blizzard, and I walked and walked. \"All right, damn it, you knew what I was, and for a moment, you made that thing look alive.\" I stopped dead still, staring over the traffic at the dark snow-covered woods of Central Park. \"If it \"? all connected, come for me.\" I was talking not to him now, or the statue, but to the Stalker. I simply refused to be afraid. I was just completely out of my head. And where was David? Hunting somewhere? Hunting ... as he had so loved to do as a mortal man in the Indian jungles, hunting, and I\u0027d made him the hunter of his brothers forever. I made a decision. I was going back at once to the flat. I\u0027d look at the damned statue, and see for myself that it was utterly inanimate, and then I\u0027d do what I ought to do for Dora\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;that is, get rid of her father\u0027s corpse. It took me only moments to get back, to be going up the narrow pitch-dark back stairs again, and into the flat. I was past all patience with my fear, simply furious, humiliated and shaken, and at the same time curiously excited\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;as I always am by the unknown. Stench of his freshly dead body. Stench of wasted blood. I could hear or sense nothing else. I went into a small room which had once been an active kitchen and still contained the remnants of housekeeping from the time of that dead mortal whom the Victim had loved. Yes, just what I wanted under the sink pipes where mortals always shove it, a box of green plastic garbage sacks, just perfect for his remains. It suddenly hit me that he had chucked his murdered wife, Terry, into such a bag, I\u0027d seen it, smelled it, when I was feasting on him. Oh, hell with it. So he\u0027d given me the idea. There were a few pieces of cutlery around, though nothing that would allow a surgical or artistic job. I took the largest of the knives, carbon-steel blade, and went into the living room, deliberately with out hesitation, and turned and looked at the mammoth statue. The halogens were still shining; bright, deliberate beams in the shadowy clutter. Statue; goat-legged angel. You idiot, Lestat. I went up to it and stood before it, looking coldly at the details. Probably not seventeenth-century. Probably contemporary, executed by hand, yes, but it had the utter perfection of something contemporary, and the face did have the William Blake sublime expression\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;an evil, scowling, goat-legged being with the eyes of Blake\u0027s saints and sinners, full of innocence as well as wrath. I wanted it suddenly, would liked to have kept it, gotten it down some way to my rooms in New Orleans as a keepsake for practically falling down dead in fear at its feet. Cold and solemn it stood before me. And then I realized that all these relics might be lost if I didn\u0027t do something with them. As soon as his death was known, all this would be confiscated, that was his whole point with Dora, that this, his true wealth, would pass into indifferent hands. And Dora had turned her narrow little back to him and wept, a waif consumed with grief and horror and the worst frustration, the inability to comfort the one she most loved. I looked down. I was standing over his mangled body. He still looked fresh, wrecked, murdered by a slob. Black hair very soft and mussed, eyes half open. His white shirtsleeves were stained an evil pinkish color from the little blood that oozed out of the wounds I\u0027d accidentally inflicted, crushing him. His torso was at a hideous angle in relation to his legs. I\u0027d snapped his neck, and snapped his spine. Well, I\u0027d get him out of here. I\u0027d get rid of him, and then for a long time no one would know. No one would know he was dead; and the investigators couldn\u0027t pester Dora, or make her miserable. Then I\u0027d think about the relics, perhaps spiriting them away for her. From his pockets I took his identification. All bogus, nothing with his real name. His real name had been Roger. I knew that from the beginning, but only Dora had called him Roger. In all his dealings with others, he\u0027d had exotic aliases, with odd medieval sounds. This passport said Frederick Wynken. Now that amused me. Frederick Wynken. I gathered all identifying materials and put them in my pockets to be totally destroyed later. I went to work with the knife. I cut off both his hands, rather amazed at their delicacy and how well-manicured were his nails. He had loved himself so much, and with reason. And his head, I hacked that off, more through brute strength forcing the knife through ten-don and bone than any sort of real skill. I didn\u0027t bother to close his eyes. The stare of the dead holds so little fascination, really. It mimics nothing living. His mouth was soft without emotion, and cheeks smooth in death. The usual thing. These\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the head, and the hands\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;I put into two separate green sacks, and then I folded up the body, more or less, and crammed it into the third sack. There was blood all over the carpet, which I realized was only one of many, many carpets layering this floor, junk-shop style, and that was too bad. But the point was, the body was on its way out. Its decay wouldn\u0027t bring mortals from above or below. And without the body, no one might ever know what had become of him .. . best for Dora, surely, than to have seen great glossy photographs of a scene such as I had made here. I took one last look at the scowling countenance of the angel, devil, or whatever he was with his ferocious mane and beautiful lips and huge polished eyes. Then, hefting the three sacks like Santa Claus, I went out to get rid of Roger piece by piece. This was not much of a problem. It gave me merely an hour to think as I dragged myself along through the snowy, empty black streets, uptown, searching for bleak chaotic construction sights, and heaps of garbage, and places where rot and filth had accumulated and were not likely to be examined anytime soon, let alone cleared away. Beneath a freeway overpass, I left his hands buried in a huge pile of trash. The few mortals hovering there, with blankets and a little fire going in a tin can, took no notice of what I did at all. I shoved the plastic-wrapped hands so deep in the rubble no one could conceivably try to retrieve them. Then I went up to the mortals, who didn\u0027t so much as look up at me, and I dropped a few bills down by the fire. The wind almost caught the money. Then a hand, a living hand, of course, the hand of one of these bums, flashed out in the firelight and caught the bills and drew them back into the breathing darkness. \"Thanks, brother.\" I said, \"Amen.\" The head I deposited in a similar manner much farther away. Back door dumpster. Wet garbage of a restaurant. Stench. I took no last look at the head. It embarrassed me. It was no trophy. I would never save a man\u0027s head as a trophy. The idea seemed deplorable. I didn\u0027t like the hard feel of it through the plastic. If the hungry found it, they\u0027d never report it. Besides, the hungry had been here for their share of the tomatoes and lettuce and spaghetti and crusts of French bread. The restaurant had closed hours ago. The garbage was frozen; it rattled and clattered when I shoved his head deep into the mess. I went back downtown, still walking, still with this last sack over my shoulder, his miserable chest and arms and legs. I walked down Fifth, past the hotel of the sleeping Dora, past St. Patrick\u0027s, on and on, past the fancy stores. Mortals rushed through doorways beneath awnings; cabbies blew their horns in fury at hulking, slow limousines. On and on I walked. I kicked at the sludge and I hated myself. I could smell him and hated this too. But in a way, the feast had been so divine that it was just to require this aftermath, this cleaning up. The others\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;Armand, Marius, all my immortal cohorts, lovers, friends, enemies\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;always cursed me for not \"disposing of the remains.\" All right, this time Lestat was being a good vampire. He was cleaning up after himself. I was almost to the Village when I found another perfect place, a huge warehouse, seemingly abandoned, its upper floors filled with the pretty sparkle of broken windows. And inside it, refuse of every description, in a massive heap. I could smell decayed flesh. Someone had died in there weeks ago. Only the cold kept the smell from reaching human nostrils. Or maybe no one cared. I went farther into the cavernous room\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;smell of gasoline, metal, red brick. One mountain of trash stood as big as a mortuary pyramid in the middle of the room. A truck was there, parked perilously close to it, the engine still warm. But no living beings were here. And there was decayed flesh aplenty in the largest pile. I reckoned by scent at least three dead bodies, scattered through the rubble. Per haps there were more. The smell was utterly loathsome to me, so I didn\u0027t spend a great deal of time anatomizing the situation. \"Okay, my friend, I give you over to a graveyard,\" I said. I shoved the sack deep, deep among the broken bottles, smashed cans, bits of stinking fruit, heaps and stacks of cardboard and wood and trash. I almost caused an avalanche. Indeed there was a small trash quake or two and then the clumsy pyramid re-formed itself quietly. The only sounds were the sounds of rats. A single beer bottle rolled on the floor, a few feet free of the monument, gleaming, silent, alone. For a long moment, I studied the truck; battered, anonymous, warm engine, smell of recent human occupants. What did I care what they did here? The fact is they came and went through the big metal doors, ignoring or occasionally feeding this charnel heap. Most likely ignoring it. Who would park next to one\u0027s own murder victims? But in all these big dense modern cities, I mean the big-time cities, the world-class dens of evil\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong you can find the strangest configurations of mortal activity. Criminality had begun to fascinate me in its many facets. That\u0027s what had brought me to him. Roger. Good-bye, Roger. I went out again. The snow had stopped falling. It was desolate here, and sad. A bare mattress lay on the corner of the block, the snow covering it. The streetlamps were broken. I wasn\u0027t certain precisely where I was. I walked in the direction of the water, to the very end of the island, and then I saw one of those very ancient churches, churches that went back to the Dutch days of Manhattan, with a little fenced graveyard attached to it with stones that would read awesome statistics such as 1704, or even 1692. It was a Gothic treasure of a building, a tiny bit of the glory of St.Patrick\u0027s, and possibly even more intricate and mysterious, a welcome sight for all its detail and organization and conviction amid the big-city blandness and wastes. I sat on the church steps, rather liking the carved surfaces of the broken arches, rather liking to sink back in the darkness against sanctified stone. I realized very carefully that the Stalker was nowhere about, that tonight\u0027s deeds had brought me no visits from another realm, or horifying footsteps, that the great granite statue had been inanimate, and that I still had Roger\u0027s identification in my pocket, and this would give Dora weeks, perhaps even months, before her peace of mind was disturbed by her father\u0027s disappearance, and she would now never know the details. So much for that. The end of the adventure. I felt better, far better than when I\u0027d spoken with David. Going back, looking at that monstrous granite thing, it had been the perfect thing to do. Only problem was that Roger\u0027s stench clung to me. Roger. He\u0027d been \"the Victim\" until when? Now I was calling him Roger. Was that emblematic of love? Dora called him Roger and Daddy and Roge and Dad. \"Darling, this is Roge,\" he\u0027d say to her from Istanbul. \"Can you meet me in Florida, just for a few days. I have to talk to you....\" I pulled out the phony identification. The wind was harsh and cold, but no more snow, and the snow that was on the ground was hardening. No mortal would have sat here like this, in this shallow high broken arch of a church door, but I liked it. I looked at this fake passport. Actually it was a complete set of false papers, some of which I didn\u0027t understand. There was a visa for Egypt. Smuggling from there, no doubt! And the name Wynken made me smile again because it is one of those names that makes even children laugh when they hear it. Wynken, Blinken, and Nod. Wasn\u0027t that the poem? It was a simple matter to tear all this into tiny fragments, and let it blow away into the night, over the tiny upright stones of the small graveyard. What a gust. It went like ashes, as if his identity had been cremated and the final tribute was being paid. I felt weary, full of blood, satisfied, and foolish now for having been so afraid when I talked to David. David no doubt thought I was a fool. But what had I really ascertained? Only that the Thing stalking me wasn\u0027t particularly protective of Roger, the Victim, or had nothing to do with Roger. Hadn\u0027t I already known this? It didn\u0027t mean the Stalker was gone. It just meant the Stalker chose his own moments and maybe they had nothing to do with what I did. I admired the little church. How priceless and ornate and incongruous among the other buildings of lower Manhattan, except that nothing in this strange city is exactly incongruous anymore because the mix of Gothic and ancient and modern is so very thick. The nearby street sign said Wall Street. Was I at the very foot of Wall Street? I rested back against the stones, closed my eyes. David and I would confer tomorrow night. And what of Dora? Did Dora sleep like an angel in her bed in the hotel opposite the cathedral? Would I forgive myself if I took one last secret, safe, forlorn peek at Dora in her bed before letting go of the whole adventure? Over. Best to get the idea of the little girl out of my mind; forget the figure moving through the huge dark corridors of that empty New Orleans convent with the electric torch in hand, brave Dora. Not at all like the last mortal woman I\u0027d loved. No, forget about it. Forget about it, Lestat, you hear me? The world was full of potential victims, when you began to think in terms of an entire life pattern, an ambience to an existence, a complete personality, so to speak. Maybe I\u0027d go back down to Miami if I could get David to go with me. Tomorrow night David and I could talk. Of course he might be thoroughly annoyed that I\u0027d sent him to seek refuge in the Olympic Tower and was now ready to move south. But then maybe we wouldn\u0027t move south. I became acutely aware that if I heard those footsteps now, if I sensed the Stalker, I\u0027d be trembling tomorrow night in David\u0027s arms. The Stalker didn\u0027t care where I went. And the Stalker was real. Black wings, the sense of something dark accumulating, thick smoke, and the light. Don\u0027t dwell on it. You have done enough gruesome thinking for one night, haven\u0027t you? When would I spot another mortal like Roger? When would I see another light shining that bright? And the son of a bitch talking to me through it all, talking through the swoon! Talking to me! And managing to make that statue look alive somehow with some feeble telepathic impulse, damn him. I shook my head. Had I brought that on? Had I done something different? By tracking Roger for months had I come to love him so much that I was talking to him as I killed him, in some soundless sonnet of devotion? No. I was just drinking and loving him, and taking him into myself. Roger in me. A car came slowly through the darkness, stopping beside me. Mortals who wanted to know if I needed shelter. I gave a wave of my head, turned, crossed the little graveyard, stepping on grave after grave as I made my way through the headstones, and was off towards the Village, moving so fast probably they could not have even seen me go. Imagine it. They see this blond young man in a double-breasted navy-blue blazer, with a flaming scarf around his neck, sitting in the cold on the steps of the quaint little church. And then the figure vanishes. I laughed out loud, loving the sound of it as it went up the brick walls. Now I was near music, people walking arm in arm, human voices, the smell of cooking. There were young people about, healthy enough to think that bitter winter could be fun. The cold had begun to annoy me. To be almost humanly painful. I wanted to go inside.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-3.html","bookId":2213,"book":{"id":2213,"title":"Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5) The fifth volume of Rice\u0027s Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books. The tale begins in New York, where Lestat, the coolest of Rice\u0027s vampire heroes, is stalking a big-time cocaine dealer and religious-art smuggler--this guy should get it in the neck. Lestat is also growing fascinated with the dealer\u0027s lovely daughter, a TV evangelist who\u0027s not a fraud. Lestat is also being stalked himself, by some shadowy guy who turns out to be Memnoch, the devil, who spirits him away. From here on, the book might have been called Interview with the Devil (by a Vampire). It\u0027s a rousing story interrupted by a long debate with the devil. Memnoch isn\u0027t the devil as ordinarily conceived: he got the boot from God because he objected to God\u0027s heartless indifference to human misery.
