{"id":103019,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"7\n IN MOMENTS, I stood in my own courtyard in the French Quarter behind the town house in the Rue Royale, looking up at my own lighted windows, windows that had been mine for so long, hoping and praying that David was there, and afraid he wasn\u0027t.\n I hated running from this Thing! I had to stand there a moment and let my usual rage cool. Why had I run? Not to be humiliated in front of Dora, who might have seen nothing more than me terrified by the Thing and thrown backwards onto the floor?\n Maybe Dora could have seen it!\n Every instinct in me told me I\u0027d done the proper thing, gotten away, and kept that thing away from Dora. That thing was after me. I had to protect Dora. I now had a very good reason to fight that thing, for another\u0027s sake, not my own.\n Only now did the full goodness of Dora take a contained shape in my mind, that is, only now did I get a full impression of her, untangled from the blood smell between her legs and her owl-like face peering at me. Mortals tumble through life, from cradle to grave. Once in a century or two perhaps, one crosses the path of a being like Dora. An elegant intelligence and concept of goodness, precisely, and the other thing Roger had struggled to describe, the magnetism which had not burst free as yet from the tangle of faith and scripture.\n The night was warm and receptive.\n My courtyard banana trees had not been touched by a freeze this winter, and grew thick and drowsing as ever against the brick walls.\n The wild impatiens and lantana were glowing in the overgrown beds, and the fountain, the fountain with its cherub, was making its crystalline music as the water splashed from the cherub\u0027s horn into the basin.\n New Orleans, scents of the Quarter.\n I ran up the back steps from the courtyard to the rear door of my flat.\n I went inside, pounding down the hall, a man in a state of visible and ostentatious confusion. I saw a shadow cross the living room.\n \"David!\"\n \"He\u0027s not here.\"\n I came to a halt in the doorframe.\n It was the Ordinary Man.\n He stood with his back to Louis\u0027s desk between the two front windows, arms folded loosely, face evincing a patient intellect and a sort of unbreakable poise.\n \"Don\u0027t run again,\" he said without rancour. \"I\u0027ll go after you. I asked you to please leave that girl out of it. Didn\u0027t I? I was only trying to get you to cut it short.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never run from you!\" I said, quite unsure of myself and determined to make that the truth from this moment on. \"Well, not really! I didn\u0027t want you near Dora. What do you want?\"\n \"What do you think?\"\n \"I told you,\" I said, gathering all my strength, \"if you are here to take me, I am ready to go to Hell.\"\n \"You\u0027re drenched in blood sweat,\" he said, \"look at you, you\u0027re so afraid. You know, this is what it takes for me to get through to someone like you.\" His voice was reasonable, easy to hear. \"Now a mortal?\" he asked. \"I could have simply appeared once and said what I had to say. But you, no, that\u0027s a different matter, you\u0027ve already transcended too many stages, you\u0027ve got too much to bargain with, that\u0027s why you\u0027re worth everything to me just now.\"\n \"Bargain? You mean I can get out of this? We are not going to Hell? We can have a trial of some sort? I can find a modern Daniel Webster to plead for me?\" There was mockery and impatience in all of this, and yet it was the logical question to which I wanted the logical answer at once.\n \"Lestat,\" he said with characteristic forbearance, loosening his folded arms and taking a leisurely step towards me. \"It goes back to David and his vision in the cafe. The little story he told you. I am the Devil. And I need you. I am not here to take you by force to Hell, and you don\u0027t know the slightest thing about Hell anyway. Hell isn\u0027t what you imagine. I am here to ask your help! I\u0027m tired and I need you. And I\u0027m winning the battle, and it\u0027s crucial that I don\u0027t lose.\"\n I was dumbstruck.\n For a long moment he regarded me and then deliberately began to change; his form appeared to swell in size, to darken, the wings to rise once more like smoke curling towards the ceiling, and the din of voices to begin and fast grow deafening, and the light suddenly rose behind him. I saw the hairy goat legs move towards me. My feet had no place to stand, my hands nothing to touch but him as I screamed.\n I could see the gleam of the black feathers, the arch of the wings rising higher and higher! And the din seemed a mixture of almost exquisite music with the voices!\n \"No, not this time, no!\" I hurled myself right at him. I grabbed for him and saw my fingers wrap around his jet-black wrist. I stared right into his immense face, the face of the granite statue, only fully animate and magnificently expressive, the horrific noise of chant and song and howl swelling and drowning out my words. I saw his mouth open, the great eyebrows scowl, the huge innocent almond-shaped eyes grow immense and fill with light.\n I held fast with my left hand clutching at his powerful arm, certain he was trying to get away from me and he couldn\u0027t! Aha! He couldn\u0027t! And then I slammed my right fist into his face. I felt the hardness, preternatural hardness, as if striking another of my own kind. But this was no solid vampiric form.\n The entire figure blinked even in its density and defensiveness; the image recoiled and redressed itself and began to grow again; I gave him one last full shove in the chest with every bit of strength I had in me, my fingers splayed out against his black armour, the shimmering ornamented breastplate, my eyes so close in the first instant that I saw the carvings on it, the writing in the metal, and then the wings flapped above me as if to terrify me. He was far from me, suddenly, gigantic, yes, still, but I\u0027d thrown him back, damn him. One fine blow that had been. I gave a war cry before I could stop myself and flew at him, though propelling myself from what base and by what force I couldn\u0027t have said.\n There came a swirl of black feathers, sleek and shining, and then I was falling; I wouldn\u0027t scream, I didn\u0027t give a damn, I wouldn\u0027t. Falling.\n Plummeting. As if through a depth that only nightmare can fathom. An emptiness so perfect we can\u0027t conceive of it. And falling fast.\n Only the Light remained. The Light obliterated everything visible and was so beautiful suddenly that I lost all sense of my own limbs or parts or organs or whatever I am created of. I had no shape or weight. Only the momentum of my fall continued to terrify, as though gravity remained to ensure utter ruin. There was one great surge of the voices.\n \"They are singing!\" I cried out.\n Then I lay still.\n Slowly I felt the floor beneath me. The slightly rough surface of the carpet. Scent of dust, wax, my home. I knew we were in the same room.\n He had taken Louis\u0027s chair at the desk, and I lay there on my back, staring at the ceiling, my chest bursting with pain.\n I sat up, crossed my legs, and looked at him defiantly.\n He was puzzled. \"It makes perfect sense,\" he said.\n \"And what\u0027s that?\"\n \"You\u0027re as strong as one of us.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think so,\" I said furiously. \"I can\u0027t grow wings; I can\u0027t make music.\"\n \"Yes, you can, you\u0027ve made images before for mortals. You know you can. You\u0027ve wrapped them in spells. You are as strong as we are. You have achieved a very interesting stage in your development. I knew I was right about you all along. I\u0027m in awe of you.\"\n \"In awe of what? My independence? Look, let me tell you something, Satan, or whoever you are.\"\n \"Don\u0027t use that name, I hate it.\"\n \"That\u0027s likely to make me pepper my speeches with it.\"\n \"My name is Memnoch,\" he said calmly, with a small pleading gesture. \"Memnoch the Devil. I want you to remember it that way.\"\n \"Memnoch the Devil.\"\n \"Aye.\" He nodded. \"That is how I sign my name when I sign it.\"\n \"Well, let me tell you, Your Royal Highness of Darkness. I\u0027m not helping you with anything! I don\u0027t serve you!\"\n \"I think I can change your mind,\" he said calmly. \"I think you will come to understand things very well from my point of view.\" I felt a sudden sagging, a complete exhaustion, and a despair.\n Typical.\n I rolled over on my face and tucked my arm under my head and started crying like a child. I was perishing from exhaustion. I was worn and miserable and I loved crying. I couldn\u0027t do anything else. I gave in to it fully. I felt that profound release of the utterly grief-stricken. I didn\u0027t give a damn who saw or heard. I cried and cried.\n Do you know what I think about crying? I think some people have to learn to do it. But once you learn, once you know how to really cry, there\u0027s nothing quite like it. I feel sorry for those who don\u0027t know the trick. It\u0027s like whistling or singing.\n Whatever the case, I was too miserable to take much consolation just from feeling good for a moment in a welter of shudders and salted, bloodstained tears.\n I thought of years and years ago, when I had walked into Notre Dame and those fiendish little vampires had lain in wait for me, Servants of Satan, I thought of my mortal self, I thought of Dora, I thought of Armand in those days, the immortal boy leader of Satan\u0027s Elect beneath the cemetery, who had made himself a dark saint, sending forth his ragged blood drinkers to torment mortals, to bring death, to spread fear and death like pestilence. I was choking with sobs.\n \"It is not true!\" I think I said. \"There is no God or Devil. It is not true.\"\n He didn\u0027t answer. I rolled over and sat up. I wiped my face on my sleeve. No handkerchief. Of course, I\u0027d given it to Dora. A faint\n perfume of Dora rose from my clothes, my chest against which she\u0027d lain, blood sweetness. Dora. I should never have left Dora in such distress. Dear God, I was bound to look out for the sanity of Dora! Damn.\n I looked at him.\n He was still sitting there, his arm resting on the back of Louis\u0027s chair, and he was simply watching me.\n I sighed. \"You\u0027re not going to leave me alone, are you?\"\n He was taken aback. He laughed. His face was marvelously friendly, rather than neutral.\n \"No, of course not,\" he said in a low voice, as if careful not to unbalance me any further. \"Lestat, I\u0027ve been waiting for someone like you for centuries. I\u0027ve been watching you yourself for centuries. No, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not going to leave you alone. But I don\u0027t want you to be miserable. What can I do to calm you? Some small miracle, gift, anything, so that we can proceed?\"\n \"And how in hell will we proceed?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you everything,\" he said with a slight shrug, his hands open, \"and then you\u0027ll understand why I have to win.\"\n \"The implication ...it\u0027s that I can refuse to cooperate with you, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"Absolutely. Nobody can really help me who doesn\u0027t choose to do it. And I\u0027m tired. I\u0027m tired of the job. I need help. That part your friend David heard correctly when he experienced that accidental epiphany.\"\n \"Was David\u0027s epiphany accidental? What happened to that other word? What had it been ... I don\u0027t remember. David wasn\u0027t meant to see you or hear you and God talking together?\"\n \"That\u0027s almost impossible to explain.\"\n \"Did I upset some plan of yours by taking David, making him one of us?\"\n \"Yes and no. But the point is, David heard that part correctly. My task is hard and I\u0027m tired! Some of the rest of David\u0027s ideas about that little vision, well\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;\" He shook his head. \"The point is, you are the one I want now and it\u0027s terribly important you see everything before you make up your mind.\"\n \"I\u0027m that bad, am I?\" I whispered, lips trembling. I was going to bawl again. \"In all the world, with all the things humans have done, all the unspeakable horrors men have visited on other men, the unthinkable suffering of women and children worldwide at the hands of mankind, and I\u0027m that bad! You want me! David was too good, I suppose. He didn\u0027t become as consummately evil as you thought he would. Is that it?\"\n \"No, of course you\u0027re not that bad,\" he said soothingly. \"That\u0027s the very point.\" He gave a little sigh again.\n I was beginning to notice more distinct details of his appearance, not because they were becoming more vivid as had happened with the apparition of Roger, but because I was growing more calm. His hair was a dark ashen blond, and rather soft and curling. And his eyebrows were the same shade, not distinctly black at all, but very carefully drawn to maintain an expression that contained no closed vanity or arrogance. He didn\u0027t look stupid either, of course. The clothes were generic. I don\u0027t believe they were really clothes. They were material, but the coat was too plain and without buttons, and the white shirt was too simple.\n \"You know,\" he said, \"you always have had a conscience! That\u0027s precisely what I\u0027m after, don\u0027t you see? Conscience, reason, purpose, dedication. Good Lord, I couldn\u0027t have overlooked you. And I\u0027ll tell you something. It was as though you sent for me.\"\n \"Never.\"\n \"Come on, think of all the challenges you\u0027ve flung out to the Devil.\"\n \"That was poetry, or doggerel, depending on one\u0027s point of view.\"\n \"Not so. And then think of all the things you did, waking that ancient one Akasha and almost loosing her on humanity.\" He gave a short laugh. \"As if we don\u0027t have enough monsters created by evolution. And then your adventure with the Body Thief. Coming into the flesh again, having that chance, and rejecting it for what you were before. You know your friend Gretchen is a saint in the jungles, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes. I\u0027ve seen mentions of it in the papers. I know.\"\n Gretchen, my nun, my love when I\u0027d been so briefly mortal, had never spoken one word since the night she fled from me into her missionary chapel and fell on her knees before the crucifix. She remained in prayer night and day in that jungle village, taking almost no nourishment, and on Fridays people journeyed miles through the jungle, and sometimes even came from Caracas and Buenos Aires just to see her bleed from her hands and her feet. That had been the end of Gretchen.\n Although it suddenly struck me for the very first time, in the middle of all this: maybe Gretchen really was with Christ!\n \"No, I don\u0027t believe it,\" I said coldly. \"Gretchen lost her mind; she\u0027s fixed in a state of hysteria and it\u0027s my fault. So the world has another mystic who bleeds like Christ. There have been a thousand.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t place any judgment upon the incident,\" he said. \"If we can go back to what I was saying. I was saying that you did everything but ask me to come! You challenged every form of authority, you sought every experience. You\u0027ve buried yourself alive twice, and once tried to rise into the very sun to make yourself a cinder. What was left for you\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;but to call on me? It is as if you yourself said it: \u0027Memnoch, what more can I do now?\u0027 \"\n \"Did you tell God about this?\" I asked coldly, refusing to be drawn in. Refusing to be this curious and this excited.\n \"Yes, of course,\" he said.\n I was too surprised to say anything.\n I could think of nothing clever. Certain little theological brain twisters flitted through my mind, and sticky little questions, like \"Why didn\u0027t God already know?\" and so forth. But we were beyond that point, obviously.\n I had to think, to concentrate on what my senses were telling me.\n \"You and Descartes,\" he said. \"You and Kant.\"\n \"Don\u0027t lump me with others,\" I said. \"I am the Vampire Lestat, the one and only.\"\n \"You\u0027re telling me,\" he said.\n \"How many of us are there now, vampires, I mean, in the whole world? I\u0027m not speaking now of other immortals and monsters and evil spirits and things, whatever you are, for instance, but vampires? There aren\u0027t a hundred, and none of them is quite like me. Lestat.\"\n \"I completely agree. I want you. I want you for my helper.\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t it gall you that I don\u0027t really respect you, believe in you, or fear you, not even after all this? That we\u0027re in my flat and I\u0027m making fun of you? I don\u0027t think Satan would put up with this sort of thing. I don\u0027t usually put up with it; I\u0027ve compared myself to you, you know. Lucifer, Son of Morning. I have told my detractors and inquisitors that I was the Devil or that if I ever happened upon Satan himself I\u0027d set him to rout.\"\n \"Memnoch,\" he corrected me. \"Don\u0027t use the name Satan. Please. Don\u0027t use any of the following: Lucifer, Beelzebub, Azazel, Sammael, Marduk, Mephistopheles, et cetera. My name is Memnoch. You\u0027ll soon find out for yourself that the others represent various alphabetical or scriptural compromises. Memnoch is for this time and all time. Appropriate and pleasing. Memnoch the Devil. And don\u0027t go look it up in a book because you\u0027ll never find it.\"\n I didn\u0027t answer. I was trying to figure this. He could change shapes, but there had to be an invisible essence. Had I come against the strength of the invisible essence when I\u0027d smashed his face? I\u0027d felt no real contour, only strength resisting me. And were I to grab him now, would this man-form be filled with the invisible essence so that it could fight me off with strength equal to that of the dark angel?\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"Imagine trying to convince a mortal of these things. But that really isn\u0027t why I chose you. I chose you not so much because it would be easier for you to comprehend everything but because you\u0027re perfect for the job.\"\n \"The job of helping the Devil.\"\n \"Yes, of being my right-hand instrument, so to speak, being in my stead when I\u0027m weary. Being my prince.\"\n \"How could you be so mistaken? You find the self-inflicted\n suffering of my conscience amusing? You think I like evil? That I think about evil when I look at something beautiful like Dora\u0027s face!\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think you like evil,\" he said. \"Any more than do I.\"\n \"You don\u0027t like evil,\" I repeated, narrowing my eyes.\n \"Loathe it. And if you don\u0027t help me, if you let God keep doing things His way, I tell you evil\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;which is nothing really\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;just might destroy the world.\"\n \"It\u0027s God\u0027s will,\" I asked slowly, \"that the world be destroyed?\"\n \"Who knows?\" he asked coldly. \"But I don\u0027t think God would lift a finger to stop it from happening. I don\u0027t will it, that I know. But my ways are the right ways, and the ways of God are bloody and wasteful and exceedingly dangerous. You know they are. You have to help me.\n I am winning, I told you. But this century has been damn near unendurable for us all.\"\n \"So you are telling me that you\u0027re not evil....\"\n \"Exactly. Remember what your friend David asked of you? He asked you if in my presence you had sensed evil, and you had to answer that you had not.\"\n \"The Devil is a famous liar.\"\n \"My enemies are famous detractors. Neither God nor I tell lies per se. But look, I don\u0027t expect for a moment that you should accept me on faith. I didn\u0027t come here to convince you of things through conversation. I\u0027ll take you to Hell and to Heaven, if you like, you can talk to God for as long as He allows, and you desire. Not God the Father, precisely, not En Sof, but... well, all of this will become clear to you. Only there\u0027s no point if I cannot count upon your willing intent to see the truth, your willing desire to turn your life from aimlessness and meaninglessness into a crucial battle for the fate of the world.\"\n I didn\u0027t answer. I wasn\u0027t sure what I could say. We were leagues from the point at which we had begun this discussion.\n \"See Heaven?\" I whispered, absorbing all of it slowly. \"See Hell?\"\n \"Yes, of course,\" he said with level patience.\n \"I want a full night to think it over.\"\n \"What!\"\n \"I said I want a night to think it over.\"\n \"You don\u0027t believe me. You want a sign.\"\n \"No, I am beginning to believe you,\" I said. \"That\u0027s why I have to think. I have to weigh all of this.\"\n \"I\u0027m here to answer any question, to show you anything now.\"\n \"Then leave me alone for two nights. Tonight and tomorrow night. That\u0027s a simple enough request, isn\u0027t it? Leave me alone.\"\n He was obviously disappointed, maybe even a little suspicious. But I meant every word of it. I couldn\u0027t say anything but what I had said. I knew the truth as I spoke it, so fast were thought and word wedded in my mind.\n \"Is it possible to deceive you?\" I asked.\n \"Of course,\" he asked. \"I rely upon my gifts such as they are, just as you rely on yours. I have my limits. You have yours. You can be deceived. So can I.\"\n \"What about God?\"\n \"Ach!\" he said with disgust. \"If you only knew how irrelevant that question is. You cannot imagine how much I need you. I\u0027m tired,\" he said with a faint rise of emotion. \"God is ... beyond being deceived, that much I can say with charity. I\u0027ll give you tonight and tomorrow night. I won\u0027t bother you, stalk you, as you put it. But may I ask what you mean to do?\"\n \"Why? Either I have the two nights or I don\u0027t!\"\n \"You\u0027re known to be unpredictable,\" he said. He smiled broadly.\n It was very pleasant. And something else, quite obvious, struck me about him. Not only were his proportions perfect, there were no visible flaws in him anywhere; he was a paragon of the Ordinary Man.\n He showed no response to this estimation, whether he could read it from my mind or not. He merely waited on me, courteously.\n \"Dora,\" I said. \"I have to go back to Dora.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"I refuse to explain further.\"\n Again, he was surprised by my answer.\n \"Well, aren\u0027t you going to try to help her with all this confusion regarding her father? Why not explain something as simple as that? I only meant to ask you how deeply you intended to commit yourself, how much you planned to reveal to this woman. I\u0027m thinking of the fabric of things, to use David\u0027s phrase. That is, how will it be with this woman, after you\u0027ve come with me?\"\n I said nothing.\n He sighed. \"All right, I\u0027ve waited for your like for centuries. What is another two nights, such as the case may be. We are speaking of only tomorrow night, really, aren\u0027t we? At the sunset of the following evening, after that I shall come for you.\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"I\u0027ll give you a little gift that will help you believe in me. It\u0027s not so simple to me to fix your level of understanding. You\u0027re full of paradox and conflict. Let me give you something unusual.\"\n \"Agreed.\"\n \"So this is the gift. Call it a sign. Ask Dora about Uncle Mickey\u0027s eye. Ask her to tell you the truth that Roger never knew.\" \"This sounds like a Spiritualist parlour game.\"\n \"Think so? Ask her.\"\n \"All right. The truth about Uncle Mickey\u0027s eye. Now let me ask you one last question. You are the Devil. Yes. But you\u0027re not evil? Why?\"\n \"Absolutely irrelevant question. Or let me put it a little more mysteriously. It\u0027s completely unnecessary for me to be evil. You\u0027ll see. Oh, this is so frustrating for me because you have so much to see.\"\n \"But you\u0027re opposed to God!\"\n \"Oh, absolutely, a total adversary! Lestat, when you see\n everything that I have to show you, and hear all that I have to say, when you\u0027ve spoken with God and better see it from His perspective, and from my point of view, you will join me as His adversary. I\u0027m sure you will.\"\n He stood up from the chair. \"I\u0027m going now. Should I help you up off the floor?\"\n \"Irrelevant and unnecessary,\" I said crossly. \"I\u0027m going to miss you.\" The words surprised me as they came out.\n \"I know,\" he answered.\n \"I have all of tomorrow night,\" I said. \"Remember.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you realize,\" he answered, \"that if you come with me now there is no night and day?\"\n \"Oh, that\u0027s very tempting,\" I said. \"But that\u0027s what Devils do so well. Tempt. I need to think about this, and consult others for advice.\"\n \"Consult others?\" He seemed genuinely surprised.\n \"I\u0027m not going off with the Devil without telling anyone,\" I said. \"You\u0027re the Devil! Goddamn it, why should I trust the Devil? That\u0027s absurd! You\u0027re playing by rules, somebody\u0027s rules. Everybody always is. And I don\u0027t know the rules. Well. You gave me the choice, and this is my choice. Two full nights, and not before then. Leave me alone all that time! Give me your oath.\"\n \"Why?\" he asked politely, as if dealing with an ornery child. \"So you won\u0027t have to fear the sound of my footsteps?\"\n \"Possibly.\"\n \"What good is an oath on this if you don\u0027t accept the truth of all the rest that I\u0027ve said?\" He shook his head as if I were being foolishly human.\n \"Can you swear an oath or not?\"\n \"You have my oath,\" he said, laying his hand on his heart, or where his heart should have been. \"With complete sincerity, of course.\"\n \"Thank you, I feel much better,\" I said.\n \"David won\u0027t believe you,\" he said gently.\n \"I know,\" I said.\n \"On the third night,\" he said with an emphatic nod, \"I shall come back for you here. Or wherever you happen to be at the time.\"\n And with a final smile, as bright as the earlier one, he disappeared.\n It was not the way I tended to do it, by making off with such swiftness no human could track it.\n He actually vanished on the spot. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-8.html","bookId":2213,"book":{"id":2213,"title":"Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5) \n The fifth volume of Rice\u0027s Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books.
