He might even dissolve the lot of us, for surely He can make His judgment on my success or failure before I ever reach the gates of Heaven. What had He said in His Infinite Wisdom? He had said, \u0027Come back as soon as you can.\u0027 \"I drew these souls to me, tight as I drew you when I took you upwards, and out of Sheol we rose, into the full blasting light of Heaven as it came pouring over the walls and the gates. And once again, those gates, which I had never seen in my early eons, were thrown open, and we found ourselves, one Archangel and a few million human souls, standing once more in the very midst of Heaven before amazed and laughing and pointing and startled and flabbergasted angels who gathered around us in a great circle, crying to get the attention of everyone until Heaven finally fell quiet. \"Well, I thought, so far so good. We\u0027re inside. And the human souls! The human souls could see the angels and the human souls were overjoyed. Oh, I can\u0027t even remember this moment without dancing. I can\u0027t remember it without singing. The souls were jubilant, and when the angels began their great potentially cacophonous singing of questions and exclamations, the human souls began to sing! \"Indeed, Heaven was never going to be the same. I knew it. I knew it instantly. Because this is what took place. These souls brought with them the same powers of projection which they had learnt in Sheol, that is to create around them out of the invisible something of an environment that they wanted, longed for, and to which they were able to give their full wills. \"And the geography of Heaven was changed dramatically and instantly and in an infinite capacity. There rose the towers and castles and mansions which you saw when I took you there, the domed palaces and libraries, and the gardens, oh, the breathtaking projections of flowers in all directions, things that angels simply never thought to bring to Heaven ...well, it was all there. Trees rose in their mature fullness; rain came in whispering gusts, full of fragrance. The sky warmed and colors everywhere expanded or deepened. These souls took the invisible fabric of Heaven, whatever it is\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;energy, essence, the light of God, the Creative Power of God\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and in a twinkling surrounded us all with wondrous constructions representing their curiosity, their concepts of beauty and their desires! \"All that they had learnt on Earth they had brought into Heaven, creating it irresistibly in its most cherished form! \"The commotion was beyond anything I had ever witnessed since the Creation of the Universe itself. \"And nobody appeared more astonished than the Archangel Michael, who was staring at me as if to say, \u0027Memnoch, you\u0027ve brought them into Heaven!\u0027 \"But before he could get those words out, and as the souls still stood together, only beginning to realize that they could shift and touch the angels and touch the things they envisioned, there came the light of God Himself\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;En Sof\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf; rising and spreading out from behind the figures of the Seraphim and Cherubim, and very gently and considerately falling down upon these human souls, filling each and laying all secrets of each totally open, as angels are open. \"The human souls cried with joy. Anthems rose from the Angels. I began to sing with my arms outstretched, \u0027Lord, Lord, I have your souls, worthy of Heaven, and look what they have brought to Heaven, Lord, look on your Creation, look on the Souls of those you evolved from the tiniest cells through flesh and blood and Sheol to your very Throne. Lord, we are here! Lord, it\u0027s done, it\u0027s done. It\u0027s happened. I have come back and you have allowed it.\u0027 \"And having said more than enough, I fell down on my knees. \"The songs had reached a frenzy, a sound no flesh-and-blood human could endure. Anthems rose from all quarters. The human souls were growing denser, more visible, until they appeared as clearly to us as we did to them and to each other. Some of them were locking hands and jumping up and down like little children. Others were merely crying and screaming and the tears were flooding down their faces. \"And then the light swelled. We knew God was about to speak. We fell silent, en masse. We were all the bene ha elohim. And God said: \"My Children. My beloved Children. Memnoch stands with his Millions, and they are worthy of Heaven.\u0027 \"And the voice of God ceased, and the light grew stronger and warmer, and all of Heaven became pure acceptance and pure love. \"I lay down upon the floor of Heaven in weariness, staring upwards into the great firmament of beautiful blue sky and ever-twinkling stars. I heard the souls of the humans rushing hither and thither. I heard the welcoming hymns and incantations of the angels. I heard everything, and then, in imitation of a mortal, I closed my eyes. \"Did God ever sleep? I don\u0027t know. I closed my eyes, and I lay still in the Light of God, and after all those years and years in Sheol I was safe again, and I was warm. \"Finally, I realized that the Seraphim had come to me, three or four of them, I didn\u0027t really notice, and they were standing over me, and looking down on me, their faces almost unendurably bright with reflected light. \"Memnoch, God wants to speak to you alone,\u0027 they said. \"Yes, at once!\u0027 I sprang to my feet. \"And far from the jubilant throngs, I found myself standing in silence, in quiet, without companions, my arm up over my eyes, my eyes down, and near as I could possibly be to the presence of the Lord.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-17.html","bookId":2213,"book":{"id":2213,"title":"Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5) The fifth volume of Rice\u0027s Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books. The tale begins in New York, where Lestat, the coolest of Rice\u0027s vampire heroes, is stalking a big-time cocaine dealer and religious-art smuggler--this guy should get it in the neck. Lestat is also growing fascinated with the dealer\u0027s lovely daughter, a TV evangelist who\u0027s not a fraud. Lestat is also being stalked himself, by some shadowy guy who turns out to be Memnoch, the devil, who spirits him away. From here on, the book might have been called Interview with the Devil (by a Vampire). It\u0027s a rousing story interrupted by a long debate with the devil. Memnoch isn\u0027t the devil as ordinarily conceived: he got the boot from God because he objected to God\u0027s heartless indifference to human misery. Memnoch takes Lestat to heaven, hell, and throughout history.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:25 PM"}}
