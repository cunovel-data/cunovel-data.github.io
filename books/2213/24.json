{"id":103035,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"23\n I REMAINED unconscious the full twenty-four hours, waking only as the sun died behind the winter sky the next evening.\n There was a fine outlay of my own good clothes for me displayed on the wooden chest, and a pair of my own shoes.\n I tried to imagine who had made this selection from amongst all that David had earlier sent here for me from the nearby hotel. Surely he was the logical choice. And I smiled, thinking of how often in our lives David and I had been utterly entangled in the adventure of clothes.\n But you see, if a vampire leaves out details like clothes, the story doesn\u0027t make sense. Even the most grandiose mythic characters\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;if they are flesh and blood\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;do have to worry about the latchets on sandals.\n It struck me with full force that I was back from the realm where clothes changed shape through the will of the clothed. That I was covered in dirt and did have only one shoe.\n I stood up, fully alert, removed the veil carefully without unfolding it or chancing to look at it, though I thought I could see the dark image through the cloth. I removed all my garments with care, and then stacked them together on the blanket, so that not one pine needle would be lost that didn\u0027t have to be lost. And then I went into the nearby bathroom\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the customary chamber of tile and ferocious steam\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and bathed like a man being baptized in the Jordan. David had laid out for me all the requisite toys\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;combs, brushes, scissors. Vampires need almost nothing else, really.\n All the while I had the door of the bathroom open. Had anyone dared to step into the bedroom I would have leapt from the steamy downpour and ordered that person out.\n At last I myself emerged, wet and clean, combed my hair, dried carefully, and put on all of my own fresh garments from the inside out, that is from silk shorts and undershirt and black socks, to the clean wool pants, shirt, vest, and double-breasted blazer of a blue suit.\n Then I bent down and picked up the folded veil. I held it, not daring to open it.\n But I could see the darkness on the other side of the fabric. This time I was sure. I put the veil inside my vest, buttoning the vest tight.\n I looked in the mirror. It was a madman in a Brooks Brothers suit, a demon with wild, frenzied blond locks, his collar open, staring with one horrible eye at himself in the mirror.\n The eye, good God, the eye!\n My fingers moved up to examine the empty socket, the slightly wrinkled lids that tried to close it off. What to do, what to do. If only I had a black patch, a gentleman\u0027s patch. But I didn\u0027t.\n My face was desecrated by the missing eye. I realized I was shaking violently. David had left for me one of my broad, scarflike ties, of violet silk, and this I wrapped around my collar, making it stand up like a collar of old, very stiff, the scarf surrounding it with layer after layer as one might see in some portrait of Beethoven.\n I tucked the tails of the scarf down into the vest. In the mirror, my eye burnt violet with the violet of the scarf. I saw the blackness on the left side, made myself look at it, rather than simply compensate for it.\n I slipped on my shoes, stared back at the ruined clothes, picked up a few bits of dust and dried leaf, and laid all that carefully on the blanket, so that as little as possible would be lost, and then I went outside into the hallway.\n The flat was sweetly warm, and full of a popular but not overpowering incense\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;something that made me think of Catholic churches of old, when the altar boy swung the silver censer at the end of his chain.\n As I came into the living room, I saw the three of them very distinctly, ranged about the cheerfully lighted space, the even illumination making a mirror of the nightwalls beyond which the snow continued to descend upon New York. I wanted to see the snow. I walked past them and put my eye up against the glass. The whole roof of St. Patrick\u0027s was white with fresh snow, the steep spires shaking off as much as they could, though every speck of ornament was decorated in white. The street was an impassable valley of white. Had they ceased to plow it?\n People of New York moved below. Were these only the living? I stared with my right eye. I could see only what seemed to be the living.\n I scanned the roof of the church in a near panic, suddenly, expecting to see a gargoyle wound into the artwork and discover that the gargoyle was alive and watching me.\n But I had no feeling of anyone except those in the room, whom I loved, who were patiently waiting upon me and my melodramatic and self-indulgent silence.\n I turned around. Armand had once again decked himself out in high-fashion velvet and embroidered lace, the kind of \"romantic new look\" one could find at any of the shops in the deep crevasse below us. His auburn hair was free and uncut and hung down in the way it used to do in ages long past, when as Satan\u0027s saint of the vampires of Paris, he would not have allowed himself the vanity to cut one lock of it. Only it was clean, shining clean, auburn in the light, and against the dark blood-red of his coat. And there were his sad and always youthful eyes looking at me, the smooth boyish cheeks, the angel\u0027s mouth. He sat at the table, reserved, filled with love and curiosity, and even a vague kind of humility which seemed to say:\n Put aside all our disputes. I am here for you.\n \"Yes,\" I said aloud. \"Thank you.\"\n David sat there, the robust brown-haired young Anglo-Indian, juicy and succulent to behold as he had been since the night I made him one of us. He wore his English tweed, with leather-patched elbows, and a vest as tightly buttoned as my own, and a cashmere scarf protecting his neck from the cold to which perhaps, for all his strength, he wasn\u0027t yet really accustomed.\n It\u0027s strange how we feel cold. You can ignore it. And then very suddenly, you can take it personally.\n My radiant Dora sat next, opposite Armand, and David sat facing me between them. This left me the chair with its back to the glass and the sky if I wanted it. I stared at it. Such a simple object, a black lacquered chair, Oriental design, vaguely Chinese, mostly functional, obviously expensive.\n Dora rose, her legs seeming to unfold beneath her. She wore a thin, long gown of burgundy silk, just a simple dress, the artificial warmth surrounding her obviously and keeping her safe. Her arms were bare and white. Her face was filled with worry, her cap of shiny black hair making two points on either side of her face, mid-cheek, the fashionable bob of eighty years ago and of today. Her eyes were the owl eyes, and full of love.\n \"What happened, Lestat?\" she said. \"Oh, please, please tell us.\"\n \"Where is the other eye?\" asked Armand. It was just the sort of question he would ask. He had not risen to his feet. David, the Englishman, had risen, simply because Dora had risen, but Armand sat there looking up at me, asking the direct question. \"What happened to it? Do you still have it?\"\n I looked at Dora. \"They could have saved that eye,\" I said, quoting her story of Uncle Mickey and the gangsters and the eye, \"if only those gangsters hadn\u0027t stepped on it!\"\n \"What are you saying?\" she said.\n \"I don\u0027t know if they stepped on my eye,\" I said, irritated by the tremour in my voice. The drama of my voice. \"They weren\u0027t gangsters, they were ghosts, and I fled, and I left my eye. It was my only chance. I left it on the step. Maybe they smashed it flat, or smeared it like a blob of grease, I don\u0027t know. Was Uncle Mickey buried with his glass eye?\"\n \"Yes, I think so,\" Dora said in a daze. \"No one ever told me.\"\n I could sense the other two scanning her, Armand scanning me, their picking up the images of Uncle Mickey, kicked half to death in Corona\u0027s Bar on Magazine Street, and the gangster with the pointed shoe squashing Uncle Mickey\u0027s eye.\n Dora gasped.\n \"What happened to you?\"\n \"You\u0027ve moved Roger\u0027s things?\" I asked. \"Almost all of them?\"\n \"Yes, they\u0027re in the chapel at St. Elizabeth\u0027s, safe,\" Dora said. \"St. Elizabeth\u0027s.\" That was the name of the orphanage in its lifetime. I had never heard her say it before. \"No one will even think to look for hem there. The press doesn\u0027t care about me anymore. His enemies circle his corporate connections like vultures; they zero in on his bank accounts and floating bank drafts, and safe-deposit boxes, murdering for this or that key. Among his intimates, his daughter has been declared incidental, unimportant, ruined. No matter.\"\n \"Thank God for that,\" I said. \"Did you tell them he was dead? Will it all end soon, his story, and what part you have to play in it?\"\n \"They found his head,\" said Armand quietly.\n In a muted voice he explained. Dogs had dragged the head from a heap of garbage, and were fighting over it beneath a bridge. For an hour, an old man watched, warming himself by a fire, and then gradually he realized it was a human head that the dogs were fighting over and gnawing at, and they brought the head to the proper authorities, and through the genetic testing of his hair and skin discovered that it was Roger. Dental plates didn\u0027t help. Roger\u0027s teeth had been perfect. All that remained was for Dora to identify it.\n \"He must have wanted it found,\" I said.\n \"What makes you say that?\" asked David. \"Where have you been?\"\n \"I saw your mother,\" I said to Dora. \"I saw her bottle-blond hair and her blue eyes. It won\u0027t be long before they\u0027re in Heaven.\"\n \"What on earth are you saying, my darling?\" she asked. \"My angel? What are you telling me?\"\n \"Sit down, all of you. I\u0027ll tell you the whole tale. Listen to everything\n I say without interrupting. No, I don\u0027t want to sit, not with my back to the sky and the whirlwind and the snow and the church. No, I\u0027ll walk back and forth, listen to what I have to tell you.\n \"Remember this. Every word of this happened to me! I could have been tricked. I could have been deceived. But this is what I saw with my eyes, and heard with my ears!\"\n I told them everything, from the very, very beginning, some things each of them had already heard, but which all of them together had never heard\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;from my first fatal glimpse of Roger and my love for his brazen white-toothed smile and guilty, gleaming black eyes\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;all the way to the moment I had pitched myself through the door of the flat last night.\n I told them everything. Every word spoken by Memnoch and God Incarnate. Everything I had seen in Heaven and in Hell and on Earth. I told them about the smell and the colors of Jerusalem. I told them and told them and told them....\n The story devoured the night. It ate the hours, as I paced, raving, repeating those parts I wanted to get exactly right, the stages of Evolution which had shocked the angels, and the vast libraries of Heaven, and the peach tree with both bloom and fruit, and God, and the soldier lying on his back in Hell, refusing to give in. I described to them the details of the interior of Hagia Sophia. I talked about the naked men on the battlefield. Over and over I described Hell. I described Heaven. I repeated my final speech, that I couldn\u0027t help Memnoch, I couldn\u0027t teach in this school!\n They stared at me in utter silence.\n \"Do you have the veil?\" Dora asked, her lip quivering. \"Do you still have it?\"\n So tender was the tilt of her head, as if she\u0027d forgive me in an instant if I said, No, I lost it in the street, I gave it to a beggar!\n \"The veil proves nothing,\" I said. \"Whatever is on the veil means nothing! Anyone who can make illusions like that can make a veil! It proves neither truth nor lies, neither trickery nor witchery nor theophany.\"\n \"When you were in Hell,\" she asked, so kindly, so gently, her white face shining in the warmth of the lamp, \"did you tell Roger you had the veil?\"\n \"No, Memnoch wouldn\u0027t let me. And I only saw him for a minute, you see, one second it was one way, and then it was another. But he\u0027s going up, I know he is, he\u0027s going because he\u0027s clever and he\u0027s figured it out, and Terry will go with him! They will be in the arms of God unless God is a cheap magician and all of this was a lie, but a lie for what? For what purpose?\"\n \"You don\u0027t believe what Memnoch asked of you?\" asked Armand.\n Only at this moment did I realize how shaken he was, how like the boy he must have been when made a vampire, how young and full of earthly grace. He wanted it to be true!\n \"Oh, yes, I do!\" I said. \"I believed him, but it could all be a lie, don\u0027t you see?\"\n \"Didn\u0027t you feel it was true,\" asked Armand, \"that he needed you?\"\n \"What?\" I demanded. \"Are we back to that, arguing whether or not when we serve Satan we serve God? You and Louis arguing about that in the Theater of the Vampires, if we are children of Satan, are we children of God?\"\n \"Yes!\" said Armand. \"Did you believe him?\"\n \"Yes. No. I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know!\" I shouted it. \"I hate God as much as I ever did. I resent them both, damn them!\"\n \"And Christ?\" Dora asked, her eyes filled with tears. \"Was He sorry for us?\"\n \"Yes, in His own way. Yes. Perhaps. Maybe. Who knows! But He didn\u0027t go through the Passion as a man alone, as Memnoch had begged Him to do, He carried His cross as God Incarnate. I tell you their rules are not our rules! We have conceived of better rules! We are in the hands of mad things!\"\n She broke into soft, sorrowful cries.\n \"Why are we never, never to know?\" she cried.\n \"I don\u0027t know!\" I declared. \"I know they were there, that they appeared to me, that they let me see them. And still I don\u0027t know!\"\n David was scowling, scowling rather like Memnoch could scowl, deep in thought. Then he asked:\n \"And if it was all a series of images and tricks, things drawn from your heart and your mind, what was the purpose? If it was not a straight proposition that you become his lieutenant or prince, then what could have been the motive?\"\n \"What do you think?\" I asked. \"They have my eye! I tell you not a word of it is a lie from me. They\u0027ve got my bloody eye, damn it. I don\u0027t know what it was all about, unless it was true, absolutely true to the last syllable.\"\n \"We know you believe it\u0027s true,\" said Armand. \"Yes, you believe it completely. You bore witness. I believe it\u0027s true. All of my long wandering through the valley of death, I\u0027ve believed it was true!\"\n \"Don\u0027t be a common fool,\" I said bitterly.\n But I could see the flame in Armand\u0027s face; I could see the ecstasy and the sorrow in his eyes. I could see the entire galvanization of his form with belief, with conversion.\n \"The clothes,\" said David thoughtfully, calmly, \"in the other room. You\u0027ve gathered them all up, and the evidence will tell some scientific tale.\"\n \"Stop thinking like a scholar. These are Beings who play at a game only they can understand. What is it to them to make pine needles and dirt cling to my clothes, but yes, I saved those relics, yes, I\u0027ve saved everything but my goddamned eye, which I left on the steps of Hell so I could get out. I, too, want to analyze the evidence on those clothes. I, too, want to know what forest it was where I walked and listened to him!\"\n \"They let you get out,\" said David.\n \"If you could have seen his face when he saw that eye on the step,\" I said.\n \"What was it in his face?\" Dora asked.\n \"Horror, horror that such a thing had happened. You see, when he reached for me, I think that his two fingers, like this, went into the eye socket, overshooting the mark. He had merely meant to grab me by the hair. But when his fingers plunged into the socket, he tried in horror to draw them out, and out came the eye, spilling down my face, and he was horror-stricken!\"\n \"You love him,\" said Armand in a hushed voice.\n \"I love him. Yes, I think he\u0027s right about everything. But I don\u0027t believe in anything!\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you accept?\" asked Armand. \"Why didn\u0027t you give him your soul?\"\n Oh, how innocent he sounded, how it came from his heart, ancient and childlike, a heart so preternaturally strong that it had taken hundreds of years to render it safe to beat in the company of mortal hearts.\n Little Devil, Armand!\n \"Why didn\u0027t you accept!\" he implored.\n \"They let you escape, and they had a purpose,\" said David. \"It was like the vision I saw in the cafe.\"\n \"Yes, and they had a purpose,\" I said. \"But did I defeat their purpose?\" I looked to him for the answer, he the wise one, the old one in human years. \"David, did I defeat them when I took you out of life?\n Did I defeat them somehow some other way? Oh, if only I could remember, their voices in the beginning. Vengeance. Someone said that it wasn\u0027t simple vengeance. But it was those fragments. I can\u0027t remember now. What\u0027s happened! Will they come back for me?\"\n I fell to crying again. Stupid. I fell to describing Memnoch again, in all his forms, even the Ordinary Man, who had been so extraordinary in his proportions, the haunting footsteps, the wings, the smoke, the glory of Heaven, the singing of angels... \"Sapphiric...\" I whispered.\n \"Those surfaces, all the things the prophets saw and sprinkled throughout their books with words like topaz and beryl and fire and gold and ice and snow, and it was all there... and He said, \u0027Drink my Blood!\u0027 I did it!\"\n They drew close to me. I\u0027d scared them. I\u0027d been too loud, too crazed, too possessed. They stood around me, their arms against me, her fiery white human arms, the warmest, the sweetest of all, and David\u0027s dark brow pushed against my face.\n \"If you let me,\" said Armand, his fingers slipping up to my collar, \"if you let me drink, then I\u0027ll know....\"\n \"No, all you\u0027ll know is that I believe what I saw, that\u0027s all\" I said.\n \"No,\" he said, shaking his head. \"I\u0027ll know the blood of Christ if I taste it.\"\n I shook my head. \"Back away from me. I don\u0027t even know what the veil will look like. Will it look like something with which I wiped my blood sweat in my sleep as I dreamt? Back away.\"\n They obeyed. They were a loose triangle. I had my back to the inner wall so that I could see the snow on my left side, though I had to turn my head to the left now to do it. I looked at them. My right hand fumbled inside my vest, it drew out the thick wad, and I felt something, something tiny and strange which I could not explain to them, or put into words even for myself, I felt the weave, that weave of cloth, that ancient weave!\n I drew out the veil, not looking myself, and held it up as if I were Veronica showing it to the crowd.\n A silence gripped the room. A motionlessness.\n Then I saw Armand go down on his knees. And Dora let out her long, keening cry.\n \"Dear God,\" said David.\n Shivering, I lowered the veil, still held wide open with both hands, and turned it so I could see the reflection of the veil in the dark glass against the snow, as if it was the Gorgon and was going to kill me.\n His Face! His Face blasted into the veil. I looked down. God Incarnate staring at me from the most minute detail, burnt into the cloth, not painted or stained, or sewn or drawn, but blasted into the very fibers, His Face, the Face of God in that instant, dripping with blood from His Crown of Thorns.\n \"Yes,\" I whispered. \"Yes, yes.\" I fell on my knees. \"Oh, yes, so very complete, down to the last detail.\"\n I felt her take the veil. I would have snatched it back if either of them had tried. But into her small hand, I entrusted it, and she held it up now turning round and round, so that all of us could see His dark eyes shining from the cloth!\n \"It\u0027s God!\" she screamed. \"It\u0027s Veronica\u0027s Veil!\" Her cry grew triumphant and then filled with joy. \"Father, you\u0027ve done it! You have given me the Veil!\"\n And she began to laugh, as one who had seen all the visions one can endure to see, dancing round and round, with the veil held high, singing one syllable over and over again.\n Armand was shattered, broken, on his knees, the blood tears running straight down his cheeks, horrid streaks on the white flesh.\n Humbled and confounded, David merely watched. Keenly, he studied the veil as it moved through the air, her hands still stretching it wide. Keenly, he studied my face. He studied the slumped, broken, sobbing figure of Armand, the lost child in his exquisite velvet and lace now stained with his tears.\n \"Lestat,\" Dora cried, tears gushing, \"you have brought me the Face of my God! You have brought it to all of us. Don\u0027t you see? Memnoch lost! Memnoch was defeated. God won! God used Memnoch for his own ends, he led Memnoch into the labyrinth of Memnoch\u0027s own design. God has triumphed!\"\n \"No, Dora, no! You can\u0027t believe that,\" I shouted. \"What if it isn\u0027t the truth? What if it was all a pack of tricks. Dora!\"\n She shot past me down the corridor and out the door. We three stood stunned. We could hear the elevator descending. She had the veil!\n \"David, what is she going to do? David, help me.\"\n \"Who can help us now?\" asked David, but it was without conviction or bitterness, only that pondering, that endless pondering.\n \"Armand, take hold of yourself. You cannot surrender to this,\" he said.\n His voice was sad.\n But Armand was lost.\n \"Why?\" Armand asked. He was just a child now on his knees.\n \"Why?\"\n This is how he must have looked centuries ago when Marius had come to free him from his Venetian captors, a boy kept for lust, a boy brought into the palace of the Undead.\n \"Why can\u0027t I believe it? Oh, my God, I do believe it. It is the face of Christ!\"\n He climbed to his feet, drunkenly, and then he moved slowly, doggedly, step by step, after her.\n By the time we reached the street, she stood screaming before the doors of the cathedral.\n \"Open the doors! Open the church. I have the veil.\" She kicked the bronze doors with her right foot. All around her gathered mortals, murmuring.\n \"The Veil, the Veil!\" They stared at it, as she stopped to turn and show it once more. Then all pounded on the doors.\n The sky above grew light with the coming sun, far, far off in the maw of the winter, but nevertheless rising in its inevitable path, to bring its fatal white light down on us if we didn\u0027t seek shelter.\n \"Open the doors!\" she screamed.\n From all directions, humans came, gasping, falling on their knees when they saw the Veil.\n \"Go,\" said Armand, \"seek shelter now, before it\u0027s too late. David, take him, go.\"\n \"And you, what will you do?\" I demanded.\n \"I will bear witness. I will stand here with my arms outstretched,\" he cried, \"and when the sun rises, my death shall confirm the miracle.\"\n The mighty doors were being opened at last. The dark-clad figures drew back in astonishment. The first gleam of silver light illuminated the Veil, and then came the warmer, yellow electric lights from within, the lights of candles, the rush of the heated air.\n \"The Face of Christ!\" she screamed.\n The priest fell down on his knees. The older man in black, brother, priest, whatever he was, stood openmouthed looking up at it.\n \"Dear God, dear God,\" he said, making the Sign of the Cross, \"That in my lifetime, God . .. it\u0027s the Veronica!\"\n Humans rushed past us, stumbling and jostling to follow her into the church. I heard their steps echoing up the giant nave.\n \"We have no time,\" David said in my ear. He had lifted me off my feet, strong as Memnoch, only there was no whirlwind, only the risen winter dawn, and the falling snow, and more and more shouts and howls and cries as men and women flooded towards the church, and the bells above in the steeples began to ring.\n \"Hurry, Lestat, with me!\"\n We ran together, already blinded by the light, and behind me I heard Armand\u0027s voice ring out over the crowd.\n \"Bear witness, this sinner dies for Him!\" The scent of fire came in a fierce explosion! I saw it blaze against the glass walls of the towers as we fled. I heard the screams.\n \"Armand!\" I cried out. David pulled me along, down metal steps, echoing and chiming like the bells pealing from the cathedral above.\n I went dizzy; I surrendered to him. I gave up my will to him. In my grief, crying, \"Armand, Armand.\"\n Slowly I made out David\u0027s figure in the dark. We were in a damp icy place, a cellar beneath a cellar, beneath the high shrieking hollow of an empty wind-torn building. He was digging through the broken earth.\n \"Help me,\" he cried, \"I\u0027m losing all feeling, the light\u0027s coming, the sun is risen, they\u0027ll find us.\"\n \"No, they won\u0027t.\"\n I kicked and dug out the grave, carrying him with me deeper and deeper, and closing the soft clods of earth behind us. Not even the sounds of the city above could penetrate this darkness. Not even the bells of the church.\n Had the Tunnel opened for Armand? Had his soul gone up? Or was he wandering through the Gates of Hell?\n \"Armand,\" I whispered. And as I closed my eyes, I saw Memnoch\u0027s stricken face: Lestat, help me!\n With my last bit of feeling, I reached to make sure the Veil was there. But no, the Veil was gone. I\u0027d given Dora the Veil. Dora had the Veil and Dora had taken it into the church.\n You would never be my adversary! \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-24.html","bookId":2213,"book":{"id":2213,"title":"Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5) \n The fifth volume of Rice\u0027s Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books.
