{"id":103012,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"LESTAT here. You know who I am? Then skip the next few paragraphs. For those whom I have not met before, I want this to be love at first sight. Behold: your hero for the duration, a perfect imitation of a blond, blue-eyed, six-foot Anglo-Saxon male. A vampire, and one of the strongest you\u0027ll ever encounter. My fangs are too small to be noticed unless I want them to be; but they\u0027re very sharp, and I cannot go for more than a few hours without wanting human blood. Of course, I don\u0027t need it that often. And just how often I do need it, I don\u0027t know, because I\u0027ve never put it to the test. I\u0027m monstrously strong. I can take to the air. I can hear people talking on the other side of the city or even the globe. I can read minds; I can bind with spells. I\u0027m immortal. I\u0027ve been virtually ageless since 1789. Am I unique? By no means. There are some twenty other vampires in the world of whom I know. Half of these I know intimately; one half of those I love. Add to this twenty a good two hundred vagabonds and strangers of whom I know nothing but now and then hear something; and for good measure another thousand secretive immortals, roaming about in human guise. Men, women, children\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;any human being can become a vampire. All it takes is a vampire willing to bring you into it, to suck out most of your blood, and then let you take it back, mixed with his or her own. It\u0027s not all that simple; but if you survive, you\u0027ll live forever. While you\u0027re young, you\u0027ll thirst unbearably, probably have to kill each night. By the time you\u0027re a thousand years old, you\u0027ll look and sound wise, even if you were a kid when you started, and you will drink and kill because you cannot resist it, whether you need it anymore or not. If you live longer than that, and some do, who knows? You\u0027ll get tougher, whiter, ever more monstrous. You\u0027ll know so much about suffering that you will go through rapid cycles of cruelty and kindness, insight and maniacal blindness. You\u0027ll probably go mad. Then you\u0027ll be sane again. Then you may forget who you are. I myself combine the best of vampiric youth and old age. Only two hundred years old, I have been for various reasons granted the strength of the ancients. I have a modern sensibility but a dead aristocrat\u0027s impeccable taste. I know exactly who I am. I am rich. I am beautiful. I can see my reflection in mirrors. And in shopwindows. I love to sing and to dance. What do I do? Anything that I please. Think about it. Is it enough to make you want to read my story? Have you perhaps read my stories of the vampires before? Here\u0027s the catch: it doesn\u0027t matter here that I\u0027m a vampire. It is not central to the tale. It\u0027s just a given, like my innocent smile and soft, purring French-accented voice and graceful way of sauntering down the street. It comes with the package. But what happened here could have happened to a human being; indeed, it surely has happened to humans, and it will happen to them again. We have souls, you and I. We want to know things; we share the same earth, rich and verdant and fraught with perils. We don\u0027t either of us know what it means to die, no matter what we might say to the contrary. It\u0027s a cinch that if we did, I wouldn\u0027t be writing and you wouldn\u0027t be reading this book. What does matter very much, as we go into this story together, is that I have set for myself the task of being a herb in this world. I maintain myself as morally complex, spiritually tough, and aesthetically relevant a being of blazing insight and impact, a guy with things to say to you. So if you read this, read it for that reason that Lestat is talking again, that he is frightened, that he is searching desperately for the lesson and for the song and for the raison d\u0027etre, that he wants to understand his own story and he wants you to understand it, and that it is the very best story he has right now to tell. If that\u0027s not enough, read something else. If it is, then read on. In chains, to my friend and my scribe, I dictated these words. Come with me. Just listen to me. Don\u0027t leave me alone.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-1.html","bookId":2213,"book":{"id":2213,"title":"Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5) The fifth volume of Rice\u0027s Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books. The tale begins in New York, where Lestat, the coolest of Rice\u0027s vampire heroes, is stalking a big-time cocaine dealer and religious-art smuggler--this guy should get it in the neck. Lestat is also growing fascinated with the dealer\u0027s lovely daughter, a TV evangelist who\u0027s not a fraud. Lestat is also being stalked himself, by some shadowy guy who turns out to be Memnoch, the devil, who spirits him away. From here on, the book might have been called Interview with the Devil (by a Vampire). It\u0027s a rousing story interrupted by a long debate with the devil. Memnoch isn\u0027t the devil as ordinarily conceived: he got the boot from God because he objected to God\u0027s heartless indifference to human misery. Memnoch takes Lestat to heaven, hell, and throughout history.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:25 PM"}}
