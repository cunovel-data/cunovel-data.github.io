{"id":103017,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"5\n VERY well,\" said David. \"Sit down. Stop pacing. And I want you to go over every detail again. If you need to feed before you do this, then we\u0027ll go out and\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;\"\n \"I have told you! I am past that. I don\u0027t need to feed. I don\u0027t need blood. I crave it. I love it. And I don\u0027t want any now! I feasted on Roger last night like a gluttonous demon. Stop talking about blood.\"\n \"Would you take your place there at the table?\"\n Across from him, he meant.\n I was standing at the glass wall, looking right down on the roof of St. Patrick\u0027s.\n He\u0027d gotten us perfect rooms in the Olympic Tower and we were only just above the spires. An immense apartment far in excess of our needs but a perfect domicile nevertheless. The intimacy with the cathedral seemed essential. I could see the cruciform of the roof, the high piercing towers. They looked as if they could impale you, they seemed so sharply pointed at heaven. And heaven as it had been the night before was a soft soundless drift of snow.\n I sighed.\n \"Look, I\u0027m sorry. But I don\u0027t want to go all over it again. I can\u0027t. Either you accept it as I told you, or I... I... go out of my mind.\"\n He remained sitting calmly at the table. The place had come \"turnkey,\" or furnished. It was the snazzy substantial style of the corporate world\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;lots of mahogany and leather and shades of beige and tan and gold that could offend no one, conceivably. And flowers. He had seen to flowers. We had the perfume of flowers.\n The table and chairs were harmoniously Oriental, the fashionable infusion of Chinese. I think there was a painted urn or two also.\n And below we had the Fifty-first Street side of St. Patrick\u0027s, and people down there on Fifth going and coming on the snowy steps, The quiet vision of the snow.\n \"We don\u0027t have that much time,\" I said. \"We have to get uptown, and I have to secure that place or move all of those precious objects. I\u0027m not allowing some accident to happen to Dora\u0027s inheritance.\"\n \"We can do that, but before we go, try this for me. Describe the man again ...not Roger\u0027s ghost, or the living statue, or the winged one, but the man you saw standing in the corner of the hotel room, when the sun came up.\n \"Ordinary, I told you, very ordinary. Anglo-Saxon? Yes, probably. Distinctly Irish or Nordic? No. Just a man. Not a Frenchman, I don\u0027t think. No, a routine flavor of American. A man of good height, my height, but not overwhelmingly tall like you. I couldn\u0027t have seen him for more than five seconds. It was sunrise. He had me trapped there. I couldn\u0027t flee, I went blank. The mattress covered me, and when I woke, no man. Gone, as if I\u0027d imagined it. But I didn\u0027t imagine it!\"\n \"Thank you. The hair?\"\n \"Ash blond, almost gray. You know how ash blond can fade to where it\u0027s really truly a ... a graying brown color, or colorless almost, just sort of deep gray.\"\n He gave a little gesture that he understood.\n Cautiously I leant on the glass. With my strength it would have been a simple thing to have accidentally shattered the wall. The last thing I wanted was a blunder.\n Obviously he wanted me to say more, and I was trying. I could recall the man fairly distinctly. \"An agreeable face, very agreeable.\n He was the kind of man who doesn\u0027t impress one with size or physicality so much as a sort of alertness, a poise and intelligence, I suppose you\u0027d call it. He looked like an interesting man.\"\n \"Clothes.\"\n \"Not noticeable. Black I think, maybe even a bit dusty? I think I would remember jet black, or beautiful black, or fancy black.\"\n \"Eyes distinctive?\"\n \"Only for the intelligence. They weren\u0027t large or deeply colored. He looked normal, smart. Dark eyebrows but not terribly heavy or anything like that. Normal forehead, full hair, nice hair, combed, but nothing dandified like mine. Or yours.\"\n \"And you believe he spoke the words?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure he did. I heard him. I jumped up. I was awake, you understand, fully awake. I saw the sun. Look at my hand.\"\n I was not as pale as I had been before I went into the Gobi desert, before I had tempted the sun to kill me in the recent past. But we could both see the burn where the rays of the sun had struck my hand. And I could feel the burn on the right side of my face, though it wasn\u0027t visible there because I\u0027d probably turned my head.\n \"And you woke and you were under the bed, and it was askew, and had been thrown over and had fallen back down.\"\n \"No question of it. A lamp was overturned. I had not dreamed it any more than I dreamed Roger or anything else. Look, I want you to come uptown with me. I want you to see this place. Roger\u0027s things.\"\n \"Oh, I want to,\" he said. He stood up. \"I wouldn\u0027t miss this for the world. It\u0027s just I wanted you to take your ease a little longer, to try to....\"\n \"What? Get calm? After talking to the ghost of one of my victims? After seeing this man standing in my room! After seeing this thing take Roger, this thing which has been stalking me all over the world, this herald of madness, this\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t really see it take Roger, did you?\"\n I thought about it for a moment.\n \"I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027m not sure Roger\u0027s image was animated anymore. He looked completely calm. He faded. Then the face of the creature or being or whatever it was\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the face was visible for an instant. By that time, I was completely lost\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;no sense of balance or locality, nothing. I don\u0027t know whether Roger was just fading as it took him or whether he accepted it and went along.\"\n \"Lestat, you don\u0027t know that either thing happened. You only know Roger\u0027s ghost disappeared and this thing appeared. That\u0027s all you know.\"\n \"I suppose that\u0027s true.\"\n \"Think about it this way- Your Stalker chose to make himself manifest. And he obliterated your ghostly companion.\"\n \"No. They were connected. Roger heard him coming! Roger knew he was coming even before I heard the footsteps. Thank God for one thing.\"\n \"Which is what?\"\n \"That I can\u0027t communicate the fear to you. That I can\u0027t make you feel how bad it was. You believe me, which is more than sufficient for the moment, but if you really knew, you wouldn\u0027t be calm and collected and the perfect British gentleman.\"\n \"I might be. Let\u0027s go. I want to see this treasure-house. I believe you\u0027re absolutely correct that you can\u0027t let all these objects slip out of the possession of the girl.\"\n \"Woman, young woman.\"\n \"And we should check on her whereabouts, immediately.\"\n \"I did that on the way here.\"\n \"In the state you were in?\"\n \"Well, I certainly snapped out of it long enough to go into the hotel and make certain she\u0027d left. I had to do that much. A limousine had taken her to La Guardia at nine a.m. this morning. She reached New Orleans this afternoon. As for the convent, I have no idea how to reach her there. I don\u0027t even know if she has the wiring in it for a phone. For now, she\u0027s as safe as she ever was while Roger was living.\"\n \"Agreed. Let\u0027s go uptown.\"\n SOMETIMES fear is a warning. It\u0027s like someone putting a hand on your shoulder and saying Go No Farther.\n As we entered the flat, I felt that for a couple of seconds. Panic.\n Go No Farther.\n But I was too proud to show it and David too curious, proceeding before me into the hallway, and noting, no doubt, as I did, that the place was without life. The recent death? He could smell it as well as I could. I wondered if it was less noxious to him since it had not been his kill.\n Roger! The fusion of the mangled corpse and Roger the Ghost in memory was suddenly like a sharp kick in the chest.\n David went all the way to the living room while I lingered, looking at the big white marble angel with its shell of holy water and thinking how like the granite statue it was. Blake. William Blake had known. He had seen angels and devils and he\u0027d gotten their proportions right. Roger and I could have talked about Blake....\n But that was over. I was here, in the hallway.\n The thought that I had to walk forward, put one foot before the other, reach the living room, and look at that granite statue was suddenly a little more than I could accept.\n \"It\u0027s not here,\" David said. He hadn\u0027t read my mind. He was merely stating the obvious. He was standing in the living room some fifty feet away, looking at me, the halogens throwing just a little of their dedicated light on him and he said again, \"There is no black granite statue in this room.\"\n I gave a sigh. \"I\u0027m going to hell,\" I whispered.\n I could see David very distinctly, but no mortal could have. His image was too shadowy. He looked tall and very strong, standing there, back to the dingy light of the windows, the halogens making sparkles on his brass buttons.\n \"The blood?\"\n \"Yes, the blood, and your glasses. Your violet glasses. A nice piece of evidence.\"\n \"Evidence of what!\"\n It was too stupid of me to stand here at the back door talking to him over this distance. I walked down the hall as if going cheerfully to the guillotine, and I came into die room.\n There was only an empty space where the statue had stood, and I wasn\u0027t even sure it was big enough. Clutter. Plaster saints. Icons, some so old and fragile they were under glass. Last night I hadn\u0027t noticed so very many, sparkling all over the walls in the splinters of light that escaped the directed lamps.\n \"Incredible!\" David whispered.\n \"I knew you\u0027d love it,\" I said dismally. I would have loved it, too, if I were not shaken to the bone.\n He was studying the objects, eyes moving back and forth over the icons and then the saints. \"Absolutely magnificent objects. This is ... is an extraordinary collection. You don\u0027t know what any of this is, do you?\"\n \"Well, more or less,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not an artistic illiterate.\"\n \"The series of pictures on the wall,\" he said. He gestured to a long row of icons, the most fragile.\n \"Those? Not really.\"\n \"Veronica\u0027s veil,\" he said. \"These are early copies of the famous mandilion\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the veil itself\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;which supposedly vanished from history centuries ago. Perhaps during the Fourth Crusade. This one\u0027s Russian, flawless. This one? Italian. And look there, on the floor, in stacks, those are the Stations of the Cross.\"\n \"He was obsessed with finding relics for Dora. Besides, he loved the stuff himself. That one, the Russian Veil of Veronica\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;he had just brought that here to New York to Dora. Last night they quarreled over it, but she wouldn\u0027t take it.\"\n It was quite fine. How he had tried to describe it to her. God, I felt as if I had known him from my youth and we had talked about all of these objects, and every surface for me was layered with his special appreciation and complex of thoughts.\n The Stations of the Cross. Of course I knew the devotion, what Catholic child did not? We would follow the fourteen different stations of Christ\u0027s passion and journey to Calvary through the darkened church, stopping at each on bended knee to say the appropriate prayers. Or the priest and his altar boys would make the procession, while the congregation would recite with them the meditation on Christ\u0027s suffering at each point. Hadn\u0027t Veronica come up at the sixth station to wipe the face of Jesus with her veil?\n David moved from object to object. \"Now, this crucifix, this is really early, this could make a stir.\"\n \"But couldn\u0027t you say that about all the others?\"\n \"Oh, yes, but I\u0027m not speaking of Dora and her religion, or whatever that\u0027s about, simply that these are fabulous works of art. No, you\u0027re right, we cannot leave all this to fate, not possible. Here, this little statue could be ninth century, Celtic, unbelievably valuable. And this, this probably came from the Kremlin.\"\n He paused, gripped by an icon of a Madonna and Child. Deeply stylized, of course, as are they all, and this one very familiar, for the Christ child was losing one of his sandals as He clung to his mother, and one could see angels tormenting Him with little symbols of his coming passion, and the Mother\u0027s head was tenderly inclined to the son. Halo overlapped halo. The child Jesus running from the future, into his Mother\u0027s protective arms.\n \"You understand the fundamental principle of an icon, don\u0027t you?\" David asked.\n \"Inspired by God.\"\n \"Not made by hands,\" said David. \"Supposedly directly imprinted upon the background material by God Himself.\"\n \"You mean like Jesus\u0027 face was imprinted on Veronica\u0027s veil?\"\n \"Exactly. All icons fundamentally were the work of God. A revelation in material form. And sometimes a new icon could be made from another simply by pressing a new cloth to the original, and a magic transfer would occur.\"\n \"I see. Nobody was supposed to have painted it.\"\n \"Precisely. Look, this is a jewel-framed relic of the True Cross, and this, this book here ... my God, these can\u0027t be the ... No, this is a famous Book of the Hours that was lost in Berlin in the Second World War.\"\n \"David, we can make our loving inventory later. Okay? The point is, what do we do now?\" I had stopped being so afraid, though I did keep looking at the empty place where the granite devil had stood.\n And he had been the Devil, I knew he was. I\u0027d start trembling if we did not go into action.\n \"How do we save all this for Dora, and where?\" David said. \"Come on, the cabinets and the notebooks, let\u0027s put things in order, find the Wynken de Wilde books, let\u0027s make a decision and a plan.\"\n \"Don\u0027t think about bringing your old mortal allies into this,\" I said suddenly, suspiciously, and unkindly, I have to admit.\n \"You mean the Talamasca?\" he asked. He looked at me. He was holding the precious Book of the Hours in his hand, its cover as fragile as piecrust.\n \"It all belongs to Dora,\" I said. \"We have to save it for her. And Wynken\u0027s mine if she never wants Wynken.\"\n \"Of course, I understand that,\" he said. \"Good heavens, Lestat, do you think I still maintain contact with the Talamasca? They could be trusted in that regard, but I don\u0027t want any contact with my old mortal allies, as you call them. I never want any contact with them again. I don\u0027t want my file in their archive the way you wanted yours, remember. \u0027The Vampire Lestat.\u0027 I don\u0027t want to be remembered by them, except as their Superior General who died of old age. Now come on.\"\n There was a bit of disgust in his voice, and grief, also. I recalled that the death of Aaron Lightner, his old friend, had been \"the final straw\" with him and his Talamasca. Some sort of controversy had surrounded Lightner\u0027s death, but I never knew what it was.\n The cabinet was in a room before the parlour, along with several other boxes of records. Immediately I found the financial papers, and went through them while David surveyed the rest.\n Having vast holdings of my own, I\u0027m no stranger to legal documents\n and the tricks of international banks. Yes, Dora had a legacy from unimpeachable sources, I could see that, which could not be touched by those seeking retribution for Roger\u0027s crimes. It was all connected to her name, Theodora Flynn, which must have been her legal name, as the result of Roger\u0027s nuptial alias.\n There were too many different documents for me to assess the full value, only that it had been accumulated over time. It seemed Dora might have started a new Crusade to take back Istanbul from the Turks had she wanted to. There were some letters... I could pinpoint the exact date two years ago when Dora had refused all further assistance from the two trusts of which she had knowledge. As for the rest, I wondered if she had any idea of the scope.\n Scope is everything when it comes to money. Imagination and scope. You lack either of these two things and you can\u0027t make moral decisions, or so I\u0027ve always thought. It sounds contemptible, but think about it. It\u0027s not contemptible. Money is power to feed the hungry. To clothe the poor. But you have to know that. Dora had trusts and trusts, and trusts to pay taxes on all the trusts.\n I thought in a moment\u0027s sorrow of how I had meant to help my beloved Gretchen\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;Sister Marguerite\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and how the mere sight of me had ruined everything, and I\u0027d retreated from her life, with all my gold still in the coffers. Didn\u0027t it always turn out Hke that? I was no saint. I didn\u0027t feed the hungry.\n But Dora! Quite suddenly it dawned on me\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;she had become my daughter! She had become my saint just as she\u0027d been Roger\u0027s. NOW she had another rich father. She had me!\n \"What is it?\" David asked with alarm. He was going through a carton of papers. \"You\u0027ve seen the ghost again?\"\n For one moment, I almost went into one of my major tremours, but I got a grip. I didn\u0027t say anything, but I saw it ever more clearly.\n Watch out for Dora! Of course I would watch out for Dora, and somehow I\u0027d convince her to accept everything. Maybe Roger hadn\u0027t known the proper arguments. And Roger was now a martyr for all his treasures. Yes, his last angle had been the right angle. He\u0027d ransomed his treasures. Maybe with Dora, if properly explained. ...\n I was distracted. There they were, the twelve books. Each in a neat thin film of plastic, lined up on the top shelf of a small desk, right near the file cabinet. I knew what they were. I knew. And then there were Roger\u0027s labels on them, his fancy scribbling on a small white sticker, \"W de W.\"\n \"Look,\" David said, rising from his knees and wiping the dust from his pants. \"These are all simple legal papers on the purchases, everything here is clean, apparently, or has been laundered; there are dozens of receipts, certificates of authentication. I say we take all of this out of here now.\"\n \"Yes, but how, and to where?\"\n \"Think, what\u0027s the safest place? Your rooms in New Orleans are certainly not safe. We can\u0027t trust these things to a warehouse in a city like New York.\"\n \"Exactly. I do have rooms here at a little hotel across from the park but that....\"\n \"Yes, I remember, that\u0027s where the Body Thief followed you. You mean you didn\u0027t change that address?\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t matter. It wouldn\u0027t hold all this.\"\n \"But you realize that our sizable quarters in the Olympic Tower would hold all this,\" he said.\n \"You serious?\" I asked.\n \"Of course I am. What could be more secure? Now we\u0027ve work to do. We can\u0027t have any mortal connections with this. We\u0027re going to do all this toiling ourselves.\"\n \"Ah!\" I gave a disgusted sigh. \"You mean wrap all this and move it?\"\n He laughed. \"Yes! Hercules had to do such things, and so have angels. How do you think Michael felt when he had to go from door to door in Egypt slaying the First Born of every house? Come on. You don\u0027t realize how simple it is to cushion all these items with modern plastics. I say we move it ourselves. It will be a venture. Why not go over the roofs.\"\n \"Ah, there is nothing more irritating than the energy of a fledgling vampire,\" I said wearily. But I knew he was right. And our strength was incalculably greater than that of any mortal helper. We could have all this cleared out perhaps within the night.\n Some night!\n I will say in retrospect that labor is an antidote for angst and general misery, and the fear that the Devil is going to grab you by the throat at any moment and bring you down into the fiery pit!\n We amassed a huge supply of an insulating material made with bubbles of air trapped in plastic, which could indeed bind the most fragile relic in a harmless embrace. I removed the financial papers and the books of Wynken, carefully examining each to make sure I was right about what I had, and then we proceeded to the heavy labor.\n Sack by sack we transported all the smaller objects, going over the rooftops as David had suggested, unnoticed by mortals, two stealthy black figures flying as witches might to the Sabbath.\n The larger objects we had to take more lovingly, each of us toting one at a time in our arms. I deliberately avoided the great white marble angel. But David loved it, talking to it all the way until we reached our destination. And all this was slipped into the secure rooms of the Olympic Tower in a rather proper way through the freight stairways, with the obligatory mortal pace.\n Our little clocks would wind down as we touched the mortal world, and we would pass into it quickly, gentlemen furnishing their new digs with appropriately and securely wrapped treasures.\n Soon the clean, carpeted rooms above St. Patrick\u0027s housed a wilderness of ghostly plastic packages, some looking all too much like mummies, or less carefully embalmed dead bodies. The white marble angel with her seashell holy water basin was perhaps the largest. The books of Wynken, wrapped and bound, lay on the Oriental dining table. I hadn\u0027t really had a chance to look at them, but now was not the moment.\n I sank down in a chair in the front room, panting from sheer boredom and fury that I had had to do anything so utterly menial. David was jubilant.\n \"The security\u0027s perfect here,\" David said enthusiastically. His young male body seemed inflamed with his own personal spirit. When I looked at him, sometimes I saw both merged\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the elderly David, the young strapping Anglo-Indian male form. But most of the time, he was merely starkly perfect. And surely the strongest fledgling I had ever produced.\n That wasn\u0027t due only to the strength of my blood or my own trials and tribulations before I\u0027d brought him over. I\u0027d given him more blood than I\u0027d ever given the others when I made him. I\u0027d risked my own survival. But no matter\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;I sat there loving him, loving my own work. I was full of dust.\n I realized that everything had been taken care of. We had even brought the rugs last, in rolls. Even the rug soaked with Roger\u0027s blood. Relic of the martyred Roger. Well, I would spare Dora that detail.\n \"I have to hunt,\" David said in a whisper, waking me from my calculations.\n I didn\u0027t reply.\n \"You coming?\"\n \"You want me to?\" I asked.\n He stood there regarding me with the strangest expression, dark youthful face without any palpable condemnation or even disgust.\n \"Why don\u0027t you? Don\u0027t you enjoy seeing it, even if you don\u0027t want it?\"\n I nodded. I\u0027d never dreamed he would let me watch. Louis hated it when I watched. When we\u0027d been together last year, the three of us, David had been far too reticent and suspicious to suggest such a thing. We went down into the thick snowy darkness of Central Park.\n Everywhere one could hear the park\u0027s nighttime occupants, snoring, grumbling, tiny whiffs of conversation, smoke. These are strong individuals, individuals who know how to live in the wild in the midst of a city that is itself notoriously fatal to its unlucky ones.\n David found what he wanted quickly\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a young male with a skullcap, his bare toes showing through his broken shoes, a walker in the night, lone and drugged and insensible to the cold and talking aloud to people of long ago.\n I stood back under the trees, wet with snow and uncaring. David reached out for the young man\u0027s shoulder, brought him gently around and embraced him. Classic. As David bent to drink, the young man began to laugh and talk simultaneously. And then went quiet, transfixed, until at last the body was gently laid to rest at the foot of a leafless tree.\n The skyscrapers of New York glowed to the south of us, the warmer, smaller lights of the East and the West Side hemmed us in. David stood very still, thinking what, I wondered?\n It seemed he\u0027d lost the ability to move. I went towards him. He was no calm, diligent archivest at the moment. He looked to be suffering.\n \"What?\" I asked.\n \"You know what,\" he whispered. \"I won\u0027t survive that long.\"\n \"You serious? With the gifts I gave you\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;\"\n \"Shhhh, we\u0027re too much in the habit of saying things to each other which we know are unacceptable to each other. We should stop.\"\n \"And speak only the truth? All right. This is the truth. Now, you feel as if you can\u0027t survive. Now. When his blood is hot and swirling through you. Of course. But you won\u0027t feel that way forever. That\u0027s the key. I don\u0027t want to talk anymore about survival. I took a good crack at ending my life; it didn\u0027t work, and besides, I have something else to think about\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;this thing that\u0027s following me, and how I can help Dora before it closes in on me.\"\n That shut him up.\n We started walking, mortal fashion, through the dark park together, my feet crunching deep into the snow. We wandered in and out of the leafless groves, pushing aside the wet black branches, the looming buildings of midtown never quite out of sight.\n I was on edge for the sound of the footsteps. I was on edge and a dreary thought had come to me\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;that the monstrous thing that had been revealed, the Devil himself or whoever it was, had merely been after Roger....\n But then what of the man, the anonymous and perfectly ordinary man? That is what he had become in my mind, the man I\u0027d glimpsed before dawn.\n We drew near to the lights of Central Park South, the buildings rising higher, with an arrogance that Babylon could not have thrown in the face of heaven. But there were the comforting sounds of the well-heeled, and the committed, coming and going, and the neverending push and shove of taxis adding to the din.\n David was brooding, stricken.\n Finally I said, \"If you\u0027d seen the thing that I saw, you wouldn\u0027t be so eager to jump to the next stage.\" I gave a sigh. I wasn\u0027t going to describe the winged thing to either one of us again.\n \"I\u0027m quite inspired by it,\" he confessed. \"You can\u0027t imagine.\"\n \"Going to Hell? With a Devil like that?\"\n \"Did you feel it was hellish? Did you sense evil? I asked you that before. Did you feel evil when the thing took Roger? Did Roger give any indication of pain?\"\n Those questions seemed to me a bit hairsplitting.\n \"Don\u0027t get overly optimistic about death,\" I said. \"I\u0027m warning you. My views are changing. The atheism and nihilism of my earlier years now seems shallow, and even a bit cocky.\"\n He smiled, dismissively, as he used to do when he was mortal and visibly wore the laurels of venerable age.\n \"Have you ever read the stories of Hawthorne?\" he asked me softly. We had reached the street, crossed, and were slowly skirting the fountain before the Plaza.\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"At some time or other.\"\n \"And you remember Ethan Brand\u0027s search for the unpardonable sin?\"\n \"I think so. He went off to search for it and left his fellow man behind.\"\n \"Recall this paragraph,\" he said gently. We made our way down Fifth, a street that is never empty, or dark. He quoted the lines to me: \" \u0027He had lost his hold of the magnetic chain of humanity. He was no longer a brother-man, opening the chambers or the dungeons of our common nature by the key of holy sympathy, which gave him a right to share in all its secrets; he was now a cold observer, looking on mankind as the subject of his experiment, and, at length, converting man and woman to be his puppets, and pulling the wires that moved them to such degrees of crime as were demanded for his study.\u0027 \"\n I said nothing. I wanted to protest, but it was not an honest thing to do. I wanted to say that I would never, never treat humans like puppets. All I had done was watch Roger, damn it all, and Gretchen in the jungles, I had pulled no strings. Honesty had undone her and me together. But then he wasn\u0027t speaking of me with these words. He was talking about himself, the distance he felt now from the human. He had only begun to be Ethan Brand.\n \"Let me continue a little farther,\" he asked respectfully, then began to quote again. \" \u0027Thus Ethan Brand became a fiend. He began to be so from the moment that his moral nature had ceased to keep the pace of improvement with his intellect\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;\u0027 \" He broke off.\n I didn\u0027t reply.\n \"That\u0027s our damnation,\" he whispered. \"Our moral improvement has reached its finish, and our intellect grows by leaps and bounds.\"\n Still I said nothing. What was I to say? Despair was so familiar to me; it could be banished by the sight of a beautiful mannikin in the window. It could be dispelled by the spectacle of lights surrounding a tower. It could be lifted by the great ghostly shape of St. Patrick\u0027s coming into view. And then despair would come again.\n Meaningless, I almost said, aloud, but what came from my lips was completely different.\n \"I have Dora to think of,\" I said.\n Dora.\n \"Yes, and thanks to you,\" he said, \"I have Dora too, now don\u0027t I?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-6.html","bookId":2213,"book":{"id":2213,"title":"Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5) \n The fifth volume of Rice\u0027s Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books. The tale begins in New York, where Lestat, the coolest of Rice\u0027s vampire heroes, is stalking a big-time cocaine dealer and religious-art smuggler--this guy should get it in the neck. Lestat is also growing fascinated with the dealer\u0027s lovely daughter, a TV evangelist who\u0027s not a fraud. Lestat is also being stalked himself, by some shadowy guy who turns out to be Memnoch, the devil, who spirits him away. From here on, the book might have been called Interview with the Devil (by a Vampire). It\u0027s a rousing story interrupted by a long debate with the devil. Memnoch isn\u0027t the devil as ordinarily conceived: he got the boot from God because he objected to God\u0027s heartless indifference to human misery. Memnoch takes Lestat to heaven, hell, and throughout history.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:25 PM"}}
