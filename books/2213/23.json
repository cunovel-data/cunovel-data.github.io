Keep away your combs, your towels, your comfort. I clung to the secret inside my coat. A shroud, that\u0027s what I asked for, some heavy thing to wrap about myself. They found it, a blanket, soft, woolen, didn\u0027t matter. The place was almost empty. They had been steadily moving Roger\u0027s treasures south. They told me. Mortal agents had been entrusted with this task, and most of the statues and the icons were gone down to the orphanage in New Orleans, and housed there in the empty chapel I had seen, where only the Crucified Christ had been. Some omen! They had not quite finished these tasks. A few precious things remained, a trunk or two, boxes of papers. Files. I\u0027d been gone the space of three days. The news was filled with tales of Roger\u0027s death. Though they would not tell me how it had been discovered. The scramble for power in the world of the dark, criminal drug cartels was well under way. The reporters had stopped calling the TV station about Dora. No one knew about this place. No one knew she was here. Few knew about the big orphanage to which she planned to return, when all Roger\u0027s relics had been moved. The cable network had canceled her show. The gangster\u0027s daughter preached no more. She had not seen or spoken to her followers. In newspaper columns and in bites on television, she learnt that the scandal had made her vaguely mysterious. But in the main, she was considered a dead end, a small-time television evangelist with no knowledge of her father\u0027s doings. But in the company of David and Armand, she had lost all contact with her former world, living here in New York, as the worst winter in fifty years came down, a snow from Heaven\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;living here among the relics and listening to them, their soft comfort, their wondrous tales, uncertain of what she meant to do, believing still in God.... All that was the latest news. I took the blanket from them and walked, one shoe gone, through the flat. I went into the small room. I wrapped the blanket around me. The window here was covered. No sun would come. \"Don\u0027t come near me,\" I said. \"I need to sleep a mortal\u0027s sleep. I need to sleep the night through and the day and then I\u0027ll tell you everything. Don\u0027t touch me, don\u0027t come near me.\" \"May I sleep in your arms?\" Dora asked, a white and vibrant blood-filled thing standing in the doorway, her vampiric angels behind her. The room was dark. Only a chest was left with some relics in it. But there were statues still in the hall. \"No. Once the sun rises, my body will do whatever it will to protect itself from any mortal intrusion. You can\u0027t come with me into that sleep. It\u0027s not possible.\" \"Then let me lie with you now.\" The other two stared over her shoulders at my empty left eyelids fluttering painfully against each other. There must have been blood. But our blood is staunched fast. The eye had been torn out by the root. What was its root? I could still smell the soft delicious blood I had from her. It laid on my lips, her blood. \"Let me sleep,\" I said. I locked the door and lay on the floor, knees drawn up, warm and safe in the thick folds of the blanket, smelling the pine needles and the soil that clung to my clothes, and the smoke, and the bits and pieces of dried excrement, and the blood, of course, the human blood, blood from battlefields, and blood from Hagia Sophia when the dead infant had fallen on me, and the smell of the horse manure, and the smell of the marl of Hell. All of it was wrapped up with me in this blanket, my hand on the bulk of the unfolded veil against my bare chest. \"Don\u0027t come near me!\" I whispered one more time for the ears of the immortals outside, who were so confounded and confused. Then I slept. Sweet rest. Sweet darkness. Would that death were like this. Would that one would sleep and sleep and sleep forever.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-23.html","bookId":2213,"book":{"id":2213,"title":"Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5) The fifth volume of Rice\u0027s Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books. The tale begins in New York, where Lestat, the coolest of Rice\u0027s vampire heroes, is stalking a big-time cocaine dealer and religious-art smuggler--this guy should get it in the neck. Lestat is also growing fascinated with the dealer\u0027s lovely daughter, a TV evangelist who\u0027s not a fraud. Lestat is also being stalked himself, by some shadowy guy who turns out to be Memnoch, the devil, who spirits him away. From here on, the book might have been called Interview with the Devil (by a Vampire). It\u0027s a rousing story interrupted by a long debate with the devil. Memnoch isn\u0027t the devil as ordinarily conceived: he got the boot from God because he objected to God\u0027s heartless indifference to human misery. Memnoch takes Lestat to heaven, hell, and throughout history.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:25 PM"}}
