{"id":103025,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"13 SHE TOOK me back to the encampment. She brought me inside the gates. Men and women rose from the campfires and children ran towards me. I knew that I possessed angelic beauty, and their admiring glances didn\u0027t surprise me. But I did wonder what in the name of Heaven they meant to do. \"I was seated, and given food and drink. This I needed. For three days I\u0027d drunk nothing but water, and eaten only a few berries gathered here and there in the woods. \"I sat down cross-legged with them and ate the cooked meat they gave me, and she, my woman, my Daughter of Men, crushed up against me, as if daring anyone to challenge the pair of us, and then she spoke. \"She stood up, threw up her arms, and in a loud voice told them what she had seen. Her language was simple. But she had plenty enough words to describe it\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;how she had come upon me on the banks of the sea and seen that I was naked and she had given herself to me in sanctity and worship, knowing I could not be a man of the earth. \"No sooner had my seed come into her than a magnificent light from above had filled the cave. She had rushed in fear from it, but I had walked out into it, fearless, knowing it, and before her eyes I changed so that she could see through me, yet still she saw me. And I was grown tall, with immense white feathered wings! This vision\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;this creature through whom she could see as if through water\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;she saw only for an instant. Then I vanished. I was gone as surely as I sit here now. She had hovered, shivering, watching, praying to the ancestors, to the Creator, to the Demons of the Desert, to all powers for protection, when suddenly she had seen me again\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;transparent, to summarize her simple words, but visible, falling\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;winged and enormous\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;smashing towards earth in a fall that would have killed a man, though that is what I became\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;a man, solid as everyone could see, sitting in the dust. \" \u0027God,\u0027 I prayed. \u0027What do I do? What this woman has said is true! But I am no God. You are God. What do I do?\u0027 \"No answer came from Heaven, not to my ears, not to my heart, not to my cumbersome and elaborate brain. \"As for the crowd of listeners, whom I judged to be about thirty-five, exclusive of all the children, no one spoke. Everyone was considering this. No one was quick to accept it. No one was going to jump forward and challenge it either. Something in my manner and posture held them aloof. \"No surprise. I certainly didn\u0027t cower or shiver or evince what I was suffering. I had not learnt to express angelic suffering through flesh. I merely sat there, aware that by their measure I was young, comely, and a mystery; and they were not brave enough to try to hurt me as they so often hurt others, to stab, or pierce, or burn me as I had seen them do enough times to their enemies, and to their own despised. \"Suddenly the whole group burst into murmuring. A very old man rose to his feet. His words were even simpler than hers. I would say he had perhaps half of her working vocabulary. But this was enough to express himself and he asked of me simply: \u0027What do you have to say for yourself?\u0027 \"The others reacted as if this question were an expression of sheer genius. Maybe it was. The woman pulled very close to me at that moment. She sat down beside me and with an imploring look, she embraced me. \"I realized something\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;that her fate was connected to mine. She was slightly afraid of all these people, her kindred. And she wasn\u0027t afraid of me! Interesting. That is what tenderness and love can do, and marvels also, I thought. And God says these people are part of Nature! \"I hung my head, but not for long. Finally, I rose to my feet, bringing her up with me, my mate, as it were, and, using all the words known in her language, some even that the children had been adding already in this generation that the adults didn\u0027t yet know, I said: \" \u0027I mean you no harm. I came from Heaven. I came to learn about you and to love you. And I wish you only all good things under God!\u0027 \"There was a great clamour, a happy clamour, with people clapping their hands, and rising to their feet, and the little ones jumping up and down. It seemed a consensus emerged that Lilia, the woman I had been with, could now return to the group. She had been cast out to die when she had come upon me. But she was now surely upheld. And she had returned with a god, a deity, a sky being . .. they aimed for it with many syllables and combinations of syllables. \" \u0027No!\u0027 I declared. \u0027I am not a god. I did not make the world. I worship, just as you do, the God who did.\u0027 \"This, too, was accepted in jubilation. Indeed, the frenzy began to alarm me. I felt the limits of my body keenly with all these others dancing and screaming and shouting and kicking at the wood in the fire, and this lovely Lilia clinging to me. \" \u0027I must sleep now!\u0027 I said suddenly. And this was no more or less than the perfect truth. I had scarce slept an hour or more at any one time in my three days in the flesh and was bone weary and bruised and cast out of Heaven. I wanted to turn to this woman, and bury my sorrow in her arms. \"Everyone gave their approval. A hut was prepared for us. People ran hither and thither gathering the finest skins and furs for us, and the softest chewed leather, and we were ushered into this place in silence, and I lay back down on the fur beneath me, the skin of a mountain goat, long and soft. \" \u0027God, what do you want me to do!\u0027 I asked aloud. There came no answer. There was only the silence and the darkness in the hut, and then the arms of a Daughter of Men around me, luscious and loving and full of tenderness and passion, that mystery, that combination, that purely living miracle, tenderness and lust rolling and rolling into one.\" Memnoch stopped. He seemed exhausted suddenly. He rose and again walked to the bank of the sea. He stood in the soft sand and pebbles. I saw the outline of his wings flash for a moment, perhaps exactly the way the woman had seen it, and then he was merely the large figure, with his shoulders hunched as he stood with his back to me, his face apparently buried in his hands. \"Memnoch, what happened!\" I said. \"Surely God didn\u0027t leave you there! What did you do? What happened the next morning when you woke up?\" He gave a sigh and turned around finally. He walked slowly back to the boulder, and sat down again. \"By morning, I had known her a half dozen times and lay half dead, and that in itself was another lesson. But I had no thought whatsoever on what I might do. While she\u0027d slept, I had prayed to God, I had prayed to Michael and to the other angels. I had prayed and prayed, asking what I should do. \"Can you guess who answered me?\" he asked. \"The souls in Sheol,\" I said. \"Yes, precisely! Those are the spirits who answered. How could you know? Those are the spirits\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the strongest souls of Sheol who heard my prayers to the Creator and heard the impetus and essence of my cries and my excuses and my pleas for mercy and forgiveness and understanding\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;heard all of it, absorbed it, drank it up, as they did the spiritual yearnings of their human and living children. And by the time the sun rose, by the time all the men of the group had started to gather, I knew one thing only: \"Whatever happened to me, whatever was the will of God, the souls of Sheol would never be the same! They had learnt too much from the voice of this Angel fallen into Matter who had thoughtlessly cried to Heaven and to God. \"Of course the full impact didn\u0027t hit me. I didn\u0027t sit there reasoning it out. The strongest souls had had their first glimpse of Paradise. They knew now of a Light which made an Angel weep and beg in desperation, because he was afraid he would never see that Light again. I didn\u0027t think of it. No. \"God had left me here. That is what I thought. God had left me. I went out into the crowd. The encampment was overflowing. In fact, men and women were coming from all the nearby encampments to see me. \"And we had to leave the enclosure and go out into the open, into one of the fields. Look down to the right, where the land slopes? You see down there where the field spreads out and the water turns....\" \"Yes.\" \"That\u0027s where we gathered. And it was soon clear that all of these men and women were expecting something of me, that I speak, that I work marvels, that I sprout wings, something, but what I didn\u0027t know. As for Lilia, she clung to me as ever, enticing and beautiful, and filled with vague wonder. \"Together we climbed onto that rock ... you see there, the boulders left there by the glaciers millions of years ago. There. We climbed up and she sat down and I stood before these people, and then I looked to Heaven and I opened my arms. \"With all my heart, I begged God to forgive me, to take me back, to climax this intrusion with my merciful disappearance, that is, to let me take my angelic shape, invisible, and rise. I willed it, I pictured it, I tried in every conceivable way to assume my former nature. No luck. \"In the heavens above I saw what men saw. I saw the blue of the sky, and the willowy white clouds blowing eastward, and I saw the faint daytime moon. The sun hurt my shoulders. It hurt the top of my head. And something became known to me then in all its horror: that I was probably going to die in this body! That I had forfeited my immortality! God had made me mortal and turned his back. \"I thought this over a long time. I\u0027d suspected it from the first moment, but now with the haste of a man I became convinced of it. And in me a deep anger rose. I looked at all these men and women. I thought of God\u0027s words to me, to go with those I had chosen, with the flesh I preferred to Heaven. And a decision came into my head. \"If this was to be my finish, if I was to die in this mortal body as all men die, if some days or weeks or even years were left to me\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;whatever this body could hope to survive amid the perils of life\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;then I must do with it the very finest thing that I knew. I must offer to God my finest. I must go out like an Angel, if going out is what I had to do!\" \u0027I love you, my Lord,\u0027 I said aloud. And I racked my brain for the greatest acts I could perform. \"What came to me was immediate and logical, and perhaps obvious. I would teach these people everything I knew! I wouldn\u0027t just tell them about Heaven and God and Angels, because what good would that do? Though of course I would tell them, and tell them to look for a peaceful death and peace in Sheol, for that they could attain. \"But that would be the least of what I would do. For that was nothing! What was better was this\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;I\u0027d teach them everything about their world that I could perceive logically but which had not yet become known to them. \"Immediately I started speaking to them. I led them to the mountains and took them into the caves and showed them the veins of ore, and told them that when this metal was hot it bubbled forth from the earth in liquid, and that if they could heat it again they could make it soft and make things out of it. \"Returning to the sea, I picked up the soft earth and shaped it into little people to show them how simple this was to do! Picking up a stick, I drew a circle in the sand, and spoke to them of symbols. How we might make a symbol for Lilia that resembled the flower for which she was named which they called the lily. And how we might make a symbol for what I was ... a man with wings. I drew pictures everywhere, showing them how easy it was to do it, to connect an image with a concept or a concrete thing. \"By evening, I had gathered around me all the women, and was showing them ways to tie their thongs of chewed leather, which had never occurred to them, elaborate ways of plaiting it, and making it into big pieces of one fabric. All logical. All simply what I inferred from what I knew as an Angel about the whole world. \"Now, these people already knew the seasons of the moon, but they didn\u0027t know the calendar of the sun. I told them all this. How many days to a year there should be according to how the sun and the planets moved, and I told them how they could write all this down with symbols. And soon we took the clay from the banks of the sea and we made flat plates of it, and on these plates with sticks I made little pictures of stars and heaven and Angels. And these plates or tablets were then allowed to dry in the sun. \"For days and nights, I remained with my people. I began to teach them more and more and more. When one group was tired and could take no more lessons, I turned to another, and examined what they were doing, and tried to improve their ways. \"Many things they would figure out for themselves, I knew. Weaving was very soon to occur to them, and then they would make better garments. That was all well and good. I showed them pigments similar to the red ochre they already used. I took things out of the raw earth that would make different colors for them. Every thought that occurred to me, every advance of which I could conceive, I imparted to them, greatly expanding their language in the process, obviously teaching them writing, and then I also taught them music of a wholly new kind. I taught them songs. And the women came to me, over and over again, the women\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;and Lilia stepped back\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;that the seed of the Angel might go into many, many women, \u0027the comely Daughters of Men.\u0027 \" He paused again. His heart seemed broken, remembering. His eyes were distant and totally reflecting the pale blue of the sea. I spoke up very softly, cautiously, and from memory and ready at any sign from him to break off. I quoted from the Book of Enoch: \" \u0027And Azazel... made known to them the metals, and the art of working them, and bracelets and ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of eyelids, and all kinds of costly stones, and all colored tinctures.\u0027 \" He turned to look at me. He seemed almost unable to speak. His voice came softly, almost as softly as mine had as he spoke the next lines of the book of Enoch, \" \u0027And there arose much godlessness, and they committed fornication, and they were led astray....\u0027 \" Again he paused and then resumed, \" \u0027And as men perished, they cried, and their cry went up to heaven.\u0027 \" He stopped again, smiling slowly and bitterly. \"And what is the rest of it, Lestat, and what lies in between the lines you\u0027ve spoken and the lines I\u0027ve spoken! Lies! I taught them civilization. I taught them knowledge of Heaven and Angels! That\u0027s all I taught them. There was no blood, no lawlessness, no monstrous giants in the earth. It\u0027s lies and lies, fragments and fragments buried in lies!\" I nodded, fearlessly, and rather certain of it, and seeing it perfectly, and seeing it from the point of view of the Hebrews who later believed so firmly in the purification and law, and had seen it as uncleanness and evil ...and told again and again of these Watchers, these teachers, these Angels who had fallen in love with the Daughters of Men. \"There was no magic,\" Memnoch said quietly. \"There were no enchantments. I didn\u0027t teach them to make swords! I didn\u0027t teach them war. If there was knowledge amongst another people on Earth, and I knew of that, I told them. That in the valley of another river, men knew how to gather wheat with scythes! That there were Ophanim in Heaven, Angels who were round, Angels who were wheels, and that if this shape was imitated in matter, if a simple piece of wood connected two rounded pieces, one could make an object which would roll upon these wheels!\" He gave a sigh. \"I was sleepless, I was crazed. As the knowledge poured forth from me, as they were worn down by it, and struggled under the burden of it, I went to the caves and carved my symbols on the walls. I carved pictures of Heaven and Earth and angels. I carved the light of God. I worked tirelessly until every mortal muscle in me ached. \"And then, unable to endure their company anymore, satiated with beautiful women, and clinging to Lilia for comfort, I went off into the forest, claiming I needed to talk to my God in silence, and there I collapsed. \"I lay in perfect stillness, comforted by the silent presence of Lilia, and I thought of all that had taken place. I thought of the case I had meant to lay before God, and how what I had learnt since had only fitted neatly into the case I had meant to make! Nothing I had seen in men could incline me to think differently. That I had offended God, that I had lost Him forever, that I had Sheol to look forward to, for all eternity, these things were real and I knew them, and they beat on my soul and heart. But I couldn\u0027t change my mind! \"The case I had meant to lay before the Almighty was that these people were above Nature and beyond Nature and demanded more of Him, and all that I had seen only upheld me in what I believed. How they had taken to celestial secrets. How they suffered, and sought for some meaning to justify that suffering! If only there were a Maker and the Maker had his reasons ... Oh, it was agony. And at the heart of it blazed the secret of lust. \"In the orgasm, as my seed had gone into the woman, I had felt an ecstasy that was like the joy of Heaven, I had felt it and felt it only in connection with the body that lay beneath me, and for one split second or less than that I had known, known, known that men were not part of Nature, no, they were better, they belonged with God and with us! \"When they came to me with their few confused beliefs\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;were there not invisible monsters everywhere?\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;I told them no. Only God and the Heavenly Court which ordained everything, and the souls of their own in Sheol. \"When they asked if bad men and women\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;who did not obey their laws\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;were not thrown at death into fire forever\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;an idea very current amongst them and others\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;I was horrified, and told them that God would never allow such a thing. A wee newborn soul to be punished in fire forever? Atrocity, I told them. Once again, I said to them that they should venerate the souls of the Dead to ease their own pain and the pain of those Souls, and that when death came they should not be afraid but go easily in the gloom and keep their eyes on the brilliant light of Life on Earth. \"I said most of these things because I simply didn\u0027t know what to say. \"Oh, blasphemy. I had done it, I had really done it. And now what would be my fate? I would grow old and die, a venerated teacher, and before I did\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;or before some pestilence or wild beast cut off my life sooner\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;I would engrave into stone and clay everything I could. And then into Sheol I would go, and I would begin to draw the souls to me, and I would say: \u0027Cry, cry to Heaven!\u0027 I would teach them to look upwards. I would say the Light is there!\" He took a breath, as if each word burnt him with pain. I spoke again softly from the Book of Enoch. \" \u0027And now, behold the souls of those who have died are crying and making suit to the gates of heaven.\u0027 \" \"Yes, you know your scriptures like a good Devil,\" he said bitterly, but his face was so stricken with sadness and compassion, and this mockery was said with such feeling, that it had no sting. \"And who knew what might happen?\" he asked. \"Who knew! Yes, yes, I would strengthen Sheol until those cries battered Heaven\u0027s gates and brought them down. If you have souls and your souls can grow, then you can be as angels! That was the only hope I had, to rule amongst the forgotten of God.\" \"But God didn\u0027t let this happen, did he? He didn\u0027t let you die in that body.\" \"No. And he didn\u0027t send the Flood either. And all that I had taught was not washed in a Deluge. What remained, what worked its way into myth and scripture was that I had been there, and that those things had been taught, and it was within the compass of a man to have done it; it was within logic, and not magic, and even the secrets of Heaven were what the souls would on their own perhaps have come to see. Sooner or later, the souls would have seen.\" \"But how did you get out of it? What happened to Lilia?\" \"Lilia? Ah, Lilia. She died venerated, the wife of a god. Lilia.\" His whole face brightened and he laughed. \"Lilia,\" he said again, memory lifting her out of the story and bringing her close, obviously. \"My Lilia. Cast out, and casting her lot with a god.\" \"God had taken you by that time?\" I asked. \"He had put a stop to what you were doing?\" We gazed at each other for a moment. \"Not quite so simple. I\u0027d been there three months perhaps when I woke up and discovered Michael and Raphael had come for me, and said very distinctly: \u0027God wants you now.\u0027 \"And I being Memnoch, the unredeemable, said, \u0027Oh? Why then doesn\u0027t He pick me up and take me out of here, or do what He wishes?\u0027 \"At this point, Michael looked miserable on my behalf and he said, \u0027Memnoch, for the love of God, go willingly back into your proper form. Feel your body grow in stature; let your wings carry you to Heaven. He wants you only if you want to come! Now, Memnoch, think before you.. ..\u0027 \" \u0027No, you don\u0027t have to caution me, beloved,\u0027 I said to Michael. \u0027I\u0027m coming, with tears in my eyes, I come.\u0027 I knelt down and kissed the sleeping Lilia. She looked up at me. \u0027This is farewell, my mate, my teacher,\u0027 I said. I kissed her, and then, turning, became the Angel, visible to her, letting the matter define me so that she, sitting up on her elbows and crying, would see this last vision and hold it to her heart perhaps when she needed it. \"And then, invisible, I joined Michael and Raphael and went Home. \"In the first moments I could scarce believe it; when I passed through Sheol, the souls screamed in agony and I threw my hands out in consolation. \u0027I will not forget you! I swear it. I take your suit to Heaven,\u0027 and then on and up I went, the light coming down to meet me and envelop me, and the warm love .of God\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;whether prelude to judgment or punishment or forgiveness, I did not know\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;surrounded me and upheld me. The cries of joy in Heaven were deafening even to my ears. \"All the angels of the bene ha ehhim were gathered. The Light of God pulsed from the center. \" \u0027Am I to be punished?\u0027 And all I could feel was thanks that I had seen this light, if only for moments, once again. \"I couldn\u0027t look into the light. I had to put my hands up. And as always happens at a meeting of all of Heaven, the Seraphim and the Cherubim closed around God so that the light came in rays from behind them, glorious, and a brightness that we could bear. \"The voice of God was immediate and total. \" \u0027I have a word for you, my brave one, my arrogant one,\u0027 He said. \u0027I have a concept for you to ponder in your angelic wisdom. It is the concept of Gehenna, of hell.\u0027 This word unfolded to me in all its implications. \u0027Fire and torment eternal,\u0027 said God, \u0027the inverse of Heaven. Tell me, Memnoch, from your heart. Would that be the appropriate punishment for you\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;the very opposite of the glory you forsook for the Daughters of Men? Would it be the appropriate sentence\u0026iexcl;\u0026ordf;suffering everlasting or until Time is no more?\u0027 \"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5/page-14.html","bookId":2213,"book":{"id":2213,"title":"Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5)","description":"Storyline: Memnoch the Devil (The Vampire Chronicles #5) The fifth volume of Rice\u0027s Vampire Chronicles is one of her most controversial books.
