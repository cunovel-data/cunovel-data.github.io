{"id":95644,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"S he\u0027d seen the picture of Lowell Santoro, and it was a good thing she had, because otherwise she\u0027d have completely missed him. By the term \"film producer,\" she\u0027d have been expecting a flashily dressed, heavily bling-blinged guy, probably driving some overmuscled, over-priced convertible. Lowell Santoro had on walking shorts, a staid-looking Hawaiian shirt and drove a Toyota. His sole concession to Hollywood seemed to be the sunglasses he wore, which were pretty fine, and made Jazz wish she\u0027d thought to pack some, because the morning light was pretty fierce. From the coffee shop across the street, she watched as Santoro parked in the lot of his office building. She sipped a pretty damn excellent coffee as he locked up his car and plodded up the walk to the front door of the lobby. She noted the time on her PDA, finished her coffee and got another to go. She went back to her rental car - an economy-class Ford, nice and clean, tons more comfortable than most copmobiles she\u0027d ever used for stakeouts. Her small video camera and digital still camera lay on the seat beside her, along with her cell phone and her collapsible baton. Add some CDs, and we\u0027ve got a party, she thought, and drummed her fingers on the steering wheel to the radio, which wasn\u0027t half-bad, really. She\u0027d parked to be in the shade, with a kitty-corner view of Santoro\u0027s car and a clear shot to pull out in a hurry if necessary. Not that she figured it would be necessary. This was her second day of surveillance, and she\u0027d already gotten the clear sense that Lowell Santoro was a man of rigid habits. She plugged in the last piece of equipment, using what was labeled as a \"utility power outlet\" instead of the time-honored cigarette lighter, and flicked on the tiny LCD screen on the palmtop. It had taken some trial and error in the dead of night, and some real skills, to enter Santoro\u0027s offices and set up the video feed, but she was patient and thorough, not to mention careful. Lucia had given her a solid two-month course in electronic bugging and breaking and entering...apparently, all useful skills taught by government agencies with three letters. Jazz had been a good student. She watched as Santoro\u0027s tiny little video figure crossed to his desk with a full coffee cup in his hand, exchanged some words with his assistant - indistinct in Jazz\u0027s earpiece - and began to open up his mail. All very normal. This was going to be another of Borden\u0027s \"your presence prevents it\" things, she already knew it. They\u0027d had two before the debacle with Wendy Blankenship, besides the near-drive-by back in K.C. while she\u0027d been recovering. One of them had been an all-night stakeout in a Denny\u0027s, watching a waitress who hadn\u0027t done anything but yawn, give bad service and drop a plate of food. The other hadn\u0027t been that exciting. I shouldn\u0027t be doing this. Then again, this would bring in cash, and Jazz was in favor of that. She\u0027d never been a small-business owner before. Having people like Pansy depending on her for rent money made her nervous and greedy. Santoro\u0027s phone rang. He had a conversation about an upcoming film he was producing, and against her will, Jazz thought that was kind of cool, because they were talking about casting actors she actually recognized. The assistant came and went, bringing him stacks of correspondence once the incoming mail had been disposed of. Santoro had a pair of lungs on him, and from the language he used talking to an MGM executive, he had a pair of brass balls, too. Jazz found herself liking the guy. He called his wife and talked with her, and it sounded nice, too. Comfortable. The kind of conversation adults had who could bicker a little about what color the new refrigerator was going to be, and whether or not the kids needed summer camp or not, but still end with a love you that sounded heartfelt. She never had conversations like that. Her arguments always felt so damn important...even when they weren\u0027t. Santoro seemed like a good guy. Someone you\u0027d want for a friend. Which told her something about Borden, too - because, not only was he friends with somebody warm and generous like this, he cared. Borden had a decent heart. Around an hour and a half later, the assistant broke into his routine to remind him he had some kind of set visit, which marked the end of the administrative portion of the day, and Jazz gulped down the last of her coffee as Santoro tidied up and prepared to depart. Apart from having heard half of a conversation - the wrong half, unfortunately - with Johnny Depp, she hadn\u0027t accomplished a damn thing, really. She hadn\u0027t spotted a single person tailing him, watching the office or home, or any suspicious activity whatsoever. She picked up the still camera and shot a couple of angles of his car while she was waiting for him to emerge from the building. Her cell phone rang. She flipped it open without taking her eyes from the entrance. \"Anything happening?\" Borden. She actually felt a little electric tingle at the sound of his voice, caught sight of herself in the rearview mirror and realized that she was smiling. That kind of smile. She wiped it off her face and glared at her reflection, as if it was to blame. \"Not a damn thing,\" she said. \"Your friend\u0027s doing fine.\" \"That\u0027s good.\" He sounded relieved. \"How about you?\" \"Not a damn thing happening to me, either,\" she said, \"except that I\u0027m about to OD on caffeine. You know the biggest problem about stakeouts without a partner?\" \"No conversation?\" \"No bathroom breaks,\" she said. \"Gets pretty difficult.\" \"I can imagine.\" \"You at the office?\" Because he\u0027d have to be, it was almost noon in New York. \"No. I was in court earlier. I have the rest of the day off.\" \"Do you ever work, Counselor? All I ever see you do is stroll around your office looking sharp, taking meetings, and fly around bugging the hell out of me.\" \"It\u0027s a filthy job, but the compensation\u0027s pretty good,\" he said blandly. \"So I look sharp, eh?\" \"Don\u0027t get cocky.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t think of it.\" She checked the monitor. Santoro\u0027s office was empty, except for his assistant cleaning up the coffee cup and restraightening piles of paper. He hadn\u0027t come out of the front door yet. \"I\u0027m going to have to go,\" she said to Borden. \"Anything wrong?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Go help a corporation hide its ill-gotten gains in an offshore account or something. I\u0027ll call later.\" Maybe Santoro had stopped off at the bathroom. Hell, she was starting to regret the second cup.... Another full minute passed. No Santoro. No activity in his office. Jazz drummed her fingers on the steering wheel again, this time more from nerves than any enjoyment of the pop jingle on the radio. She watched the digits crawl on her clock. He was taking way too long. \"Dammit,\" she whispered, and got out of the car. She grabbed her still camera - nothing odd about a tourist with a camera in L.A. - stuck her collapsible baton in her back pocket, covered by the windbreaker she threw on, and moved quickly toward Santoro\u0027s office building. She kept expecting him to pop out at any moment, as she got closer, but all remained quiet. Something tingled at the base of her spine, like a gun pressed close. She walked faster, took the three short steps up to the glass doors and walked in. No security in the lobby. There was a desk, but it was empty. She checked the elevators. Nothing was moving. Santoro\u0027s office was on the fourth floor, and both elevators were on the ground. If he\u0027d come out here, he\u0027d have walked out the front. There weren\u0027t any other places for him to have gone. Except for the stairs. Jazz cracked the door to the stairwell and listened, and heard a dull scuffling noise. Grunts of effort. She shoved the camera in a pocket, grabbed the baton and snapped it out to its full length as she ran up. She took the steps three at a time, feeling the burn in her thighs and a sharp twinge in her side, but if she was right, there wasn\u0027t time to take it any easier. She burst around the third-floor landing and saw, on the flat halfway point to the fourth floor, Lowell Santoro being strangled. He was still alive, barely - face congested dull purple, eyes bulging, mouth open and tongue protruding. Fingers still scrabbling weakly for the cord around his throat that had dug in so deep she couldn\u0027t even see it. The cord was all that was holding him upright. Jazz yelled - she didn\u0027t even know what - and the sound bounced and echoed sharply from the concrete all around her. The man standing behind Santoro, both gloved hands twisting a black rope, met her eyes. She didn\u0027t know him, but she knew the type - something missing in the eyes, a kind of animal vacancy that marked a bad life and a worse end coming. He was tall, blond, California-pretty, with an off-kilter nose that had seen somebody\u0027s fist close up in the not-too-distant past. He let go of Santoro and let him pitch forward, right into Jazz as she bounded up toward him. Santoro\u0027s weight - she didn\u0027t dare think, dead weight - bowled her over, and the world became a confusing, hurting blur as they fell. Jazz landed flat on her back, Santoro half-crushing her, and saw California Guy heading back up the stairs, fast. She rolled Santoro over. His eyes were blinking, and he was whooping for breath. His mouth was bloody. He\u0027d bitten his tongue. \"Stay here!\" she shouted at him, and lunged to her feet, digging her cell phone out of her pocket as she started up the steps in pursuit. She yelled out the office\u0027s street address to the 911 operator, craning her neck to try to see where California Guy was on the stairs. She paused to listen. No sound. Either he was waiting, or... She hung up on the operator, who was trying to get her to give her name, and took the next few steps slowly, quietly, feeling cold sweat slide down her back. She wished for a gun, or at least a good coating of Kevlar. California Guy might like to use his hands, but that didn\u0027t mean he was a conscientious gun objector, either. She had an unpleasant flashback of her blood glittering on asphalt, of the strange liquid feeling of being shot, and shook it off to ease up one more rising step. She was scared, she realized. Scared of being hurt. California Guy was waiting for her around the blind corner. Or rather, California Guy\u0027s powerful kick was waiting for her, and it caught her squarely in the stomach and slammed her back against the concrete wall, seeing stars and out of breath. She hung on to her baton, somehow, and saw a black flash coming at her; she ducked, and heard his fist make hard contact with the wall, followed by a loud, yelping grunt of pain. Since she was safely braced, she yanked up a knee, missed his crotch, kept going and planted her foot flat against his chest and uncoiled with a shout. He went stumbling backward. She blinked the last disorientation out of her eyes and took a surgical swing with the baton. Whap. Right in his undefended ribs, which she felt crack. As he hunched over in reaction, she gave him a hard smack to the side of the head, too. His knees buckled, but instead of falling down unconscious, he lunged from a kneeling position, got hold of her and slammed her back against the wall again. Her head impacted with a dull thud. She tasted blood and damn, that hurt. She could barely get her breath, but his hands were yanking at her waistband, fumbling for a gun she didn\u0027t have, and then he pulled her off balance and down, his weight on top. He liked to use his hands. Jazz didn\u0027t particularly mind that. She grinned at him, spit blood in his face and slammed the heel of her palm up into his crooked nose just before he managed to get a grip on her neck. It didn\u0027t drive bone up into his brain, but it certainly rearranged cartilage with a satisfying crunch and made him yowl in pain. Blood spattered her, warm as tears, and she used her leverage to flip him off. This time his head hit the wall. It was lights out, sweetheart, and he slumped sideways, breathing heavily through his mouth as his rebroken nose leaked a steady stream of red. Jazz crawled to him, yanked him forward and zip-tied his hands behind him before letting herself collapse to a weak sitting position on the steps. The place looked like a war zone. She dabbed cautiously at her face and sniffed. Yep, she had a nosebleed, too, not to mention a split lip and a ringing bell of a headache. Her side felt tight, protesting the action. One of her knees registered as hot and uncomfortable. Not bad, considering. Not bad at all. She\u0027d had worse after an interesting night of barhopping. She patted down California Guy and came up with no ID at all - not even a bus pass - but a fat wad of cash and a letter. She paused as she slid it out of his pocket, staring, because it looked...familiar. Big red envelope. Like a Hallmark card. She didn\u0027t have a proper evidence kit - hadn\u0027t thought she\u0027d need it - but this was no coincidence. Killers didn\u0027t stroll around with birthday cards for their girlfriends in their jackets. She tucked it into her windbreaker just as she heard sirens echoing up the stairwell. Heavy treads on the steps, coming up. \"Victim\u0027s on the third-floor landing,\" she called down. \"The perp is up here. He\u0027s secured.\" They came carefully, not taking her word for it. She sat against the wall, hands up, as two uniformed officers rounded the blind corner with guns leveled. When they were sure the situation was under control, she got searched. The baton got confiscated, along with the camera and cell phone. California Guy was still out cold, bleeding all over the concrete. \"Jeez,\" the bigger, older cop said, bending over him. \"I thought you looked like you\u0027d had a rough time, but this guy needs a plastic surgeon. Good thing he\u0027s in L.A. We\u0027ve got more of them than gas stations.\" The atmosphere got more congenial, when her bona fides were vetted. Ex-cops got a little more respect than bloody-faced regular citizens armed with batons, although the out-of-town private investigator status didn\u0027t necessarily win points. She went through statements to the uniforms, then another round with a blank-faced detective who didn\u0027t seem to be listening but probably was, and a third time to another detective who focused on her like he planned to marry her later. By that time, the aches were kicking in. She\u0027d washed the blood off, but desperately needed a nap and coffee, in that order. Her cell phone kept ringing. That was probably Borden, checking in and getting worried because there was no answer. \"Look,\" Jazz pointed out the fourth time it rang, \"if you don\u0027t want to have the FBI down here poking around looking for me, you might want to let me answer it. I\u0027m not operating in a vacuum. I have a partner, and I have a lawyer.\" Whatever they thought of that, they let her have the cell phone, and when she answered, sure enough, it was James Borden on the other end of the phone. But what he said wasn\u0027t what she\u0027d expected. \"He has an envelope,\" he said. No preamble. \"Get it. Don\u0027t let it out of your sight.\" \"Oh, hey,\" she said with grim cheer. \"Yeah, I\u0027m fine, by the way, thanks for asking. Your friend\u0027s in the hospital. I don\u0027t know much about him, but he was still breathing when they carted him away.\" \"I know,\" he shot back. \"But you have to keep hold of that envelope, do you understand? Don\u0027t let it out of your sight.\" The cops had taken it but hadn\u0027t evidenced much interest in it. She\u0027d said it was a card for her niece; they\u0027d returned it without comment. It was currently a thick square reminder poking a corner into her ribs under the jacket. \"Yeah,\" she replied. \"Thanks for the advice. Any ideas about who my dance partner was today?\" \"He doesn\u0027t matter.\" \"You know what? He did to me. And I\u0027ll bet he did to Santoro, too.\" One of the cops got called from the room for a whispered conversation at the door, nodded, and came back. Jazz\u0027s eyes tracked him, watching body language. She didn\u0027t much care for the change. He was boring a hole in her with his stare. She hunched her shoulders a bit as she paced the small, dingy room. It was a standard interrogation room - a battered industrial table, some sturdy chairs, a camera in the corner and an observation window. \"I\u0027m coming to get you,\" he said. \"I should be there in a couple of hours.\" She swallowed a sudden surge of relief, and said, \"I\u0027m sorry. Sorry for all of this.\" Another hesitation from him. \"You tried.\" \"I said I wouldn\u0027t let anything happen to him.\" \"You saved his life.\" That was it. No hearts and flowers, not even a fruit basket, just a quick disconnection. She stared at the cell phone for a second, then shrugged and handed it back to the hard-eyed detective, who - from the way he was watching her - must have talked to somebody back in K.C. with a less-than-glowing opinion of her. Probably Stewart. Somebody who\u0027d filled his head full of crap about corruption and murder and drug running, probably. And cited Ben\u0027s trial to back it up. \"Who was that?\" the cop asked, weighing the phone in his hand. \"Wrong number,\" she said, and smiled as brilliantly as she could, under the circumstances. It didn\u0027t get more pleasant as the day went on. She got another phone call, this one from Lucia, who was coldly furious and torn between kicking LAPD ass or Cross Society hiney. That felt oddly bracing. Jazz had quite a time convincing Lucia not to come flying to the coast, and in the end had only succeeded because Borden was already on his way and Lucia was convinced she was about to break the industrial espionage case within the day. Toward the end of the day the cops finally informed her that Lowell Santoro was resting comfortably. He wouldn\u0027t be giving any speeches soon, but he\u0027d narrowly avoided a fractured hyoid bone and a nasty death. His trachea was seriously bruised but intact. She\u0027d saved someone. She\u0027d actually, finally, saved someone. Not that you\u0027d know it from the continuing barrage of questions from two increasingly unfriendly LAPD detectives named Weston and Cammarata. Weston was thin and dressed in old, unfashionable suits; Cammarata was more the dress-slacks, snappy-tie, crisp-white-shirt type. He could have walked the halls of corporate zombiedom and looked utterly in place, if he\u0027d taken off that clip-on badge from his belt and stuck a business ID in its place. Of the two, she found she preferred Weston, who was at least honest in his dislike. Cammarata kept trying to make her think he liked her. She kept reiterating facts to them, stubbornly refused to reveal who\u0027d hired her, and finally reverted to the old standard, \"I\u0027ll wait until my lawyer gets here.\" Borden arrived looking, well, like a lawyer. A damn fine one, too. Navy blue tailored suit, crisp off-white shirt, power tie, shiny shoes, a briefcase that looked expensive and was probably worth twice whatever she would guess. He looked L.A. spiffy, in a New York kind of way. And he had her out of the police station in forty-five minutes, which she figured had to be a new world record for intimidation in a town that had more or less invented the fast-talking lawyer. \"So,\" she said as he walked her down the steps to a waiting black chauffeured car, \"you don\u0027t do criminal cases. Because you seemed to do that all right, Counselor.\" \"Shut up,\" he said darkly. She could already tell he was in a towering bad mood, which was weird, because after all, she\u0027d saved his friend. Weird, starting on annoying. \"Is that legal advice?\" He firmly directed her into the car - backseat - and walked around to climb in the other side. He\u0027d gotten another limo for a reason, she saw - better leg room. Not so critical for her, but his knees were an absurdly long distance from his hips. He flicked the locks, engaged the privacy screen between them and the driver - evidently not a Cross Society insider - and without looking at her said, \"You could have called the police instead of going in.\" \"Oh, please, what\u0027s the nine-one-one response time in L.A. when you call and say, hey, I\u0027m on stakeout and my subject hasn\u0027t come out of the building yet? I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s twenty-four to forty-eight hours, if they don\u0027t laugh you off the phone.\" \"You could have called them when you knew something was happening.\" \"By that time, your friend was about ten seconds away from choking to death on a broken throat. Look, what do you think you sent me here to do? Knit doilies? Run and hide when the going gets tough?\" She shrugged. \"Borden, you know me better than that. If there\u0027s a fight, I\u0027m in it. That\u0027s who I am.\" \"I didn\u0027t send you here to stage the first annual Stairwell Smack-down and nearly get yourself killed. Again.\" His voice sounded tight and grim, and as she stared at him, she saw the tension in his shoulders. In the hard line of his jaw. \"You like this, don\u0027t you? The adrenaline rush. Kicking ass at every possible opportunity.\" \"You think I did this for fun?\" she asked, and felt her hands trying to make fists. \"Tell me what was going through your head, then.\" \"The subject went out of the range of electronic surveillance,\" she said. \"The subject didn\u0027t reappear on schedule. I went in to check it out, which was exactly what you knew I was going to do. And if you think maybe I should have checked on him, discovered him being choked to death and gone back to the car, well, maybe you don\u0027t know me very well.\" Borden raised his head, finally, and looked straight at her. \"I know you better than you think,\" he said. There was something odd in his eyes. \"I\u0027m not the only one. Take out the envelope.\" She didn\u0027t. She looked at him, frowning, and then reached into her windbreaker and pulled it free. \"Open it,\" he said. She slit it with a fingernail and pulled out the letter folded neatly inside. \"Read it.\" She didn\u0027t want to, suddenly. It felt as if something was wrong, something was very wrong, indeed, and if she just slid this letter back in the envelope...put the genie back in his bottle...then maybe things would be different. Instead, she unfolded the crisp paper, and saw the letterhead of Eidolon Corporation. It was a bold red logo, a world in an hourglass. It read in neat typewritten lines: To Jasmine Callender, Should you read this, you will have taken matters into your hands that would have been better left to others. We have no choice but to take steps. In acting today, you have forfeited what little protection the Cross Society could offer you. Inform them. She read it through twice, numbly. There was no signature. She finally looked up mutely to stare at Borden. \"It says - \" \"I know what it says,\" he interrupted her. \"Laskins got a fax two hours ago and read it to me on the plane. Jazz, you were just another Actor before, but they know what you are now, and you\u0027ve proved a real threat. They\u0027ve moved you up to the top of their hit list. You\u0027re not safe now.\" \"But they addressed it directly to me,\" she said. The words felt strange in her mouth. \"How the hell could it be to me, when I took it from the other guy? Why - ?\" \"They must have known there was a chance you\u0027d do this. I think - \" He paused, licked his lips and looked very, very sick. \"I think the Society knew, too. They...\" \"Let me guess,\" she said. \"You heard Santoro was on the hit list. They decided to let him get taken out for strategic reasons, and you decided to act on your own. You didn\u0027t fly out to deliver an assignment from Laskins. That\u0027s you. You decided to produce the paperwork and bring it to me in a red envelope, just like the rest of them. And they told you not to do it.\" He didn\u0027t answer. He was pale to the lips. \"Did they fire you?\" \"Not yet,\" he said, and she saw some of the stiffness leave his shoulders. He slumped against the window and closed his eyes. \"Santoro - he\u0027s a good guy. He does good things. His wife and kids - \" \"So we saved him,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not upset about that, believe me. I don\u0027t believe all this fortune-telling horse-shit anyway.\" He reached out and touched the unfolded Eidolon Corporation letter still in her hand. \"No? Then why does that have your name on it, when you took it off a guy you\u0027d never met who was trying to kill you?\" \"People try to kill me all the time,\" she said. \"Not like it\u0027s new.\" He hit an intercom switch and said, \"Let\u0027s go,\" and the limo glided into motion. \"There\u0027s somebody I need you to meet.\" She groaned. \"Not more of this crap. Look, Borden, just let me go home, okay? I have things to do.\" The photos. McCarthy, waiting for freedom. Every day he sat behind bars now was another day that she couldn\u0027t take back, and could only regret. If anything happened to him... \"If I let you go home, you\u0027re dead,\" Borden said. \"I realize that might not mean much to you, because you think you can win any fight, but I\u0027m not as brave. Not with your life.\" He looked tired. As well he should, she realized; he\u0027d come all the way from New York, and for all she knew he\u0027d done it on little or no sleep. \"Borden,\" she said. He opened his eyes, which had drifted nearly shut. She wasn\u0027t sure if he was even aware of it. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"Don\u0027t apologize,\" he said, and there was a gray leaden weight to his words. \"I did this. I made the decisions. I changed the rules, and now you\u0027re a target. I need - I need to find out how to fix it.\" \"So we are going to see somebody from the Cross Society.\" \"Not exactly.\" He turned away and looked out of the smoked-glass window. \"Not exactly.\" She realized, belatedly, that he hadn\u0027t even asked if she was okay. That pissed her off to an unreasonable extent. She glared at him and read the letter again, silently. It was dated for today. She\u0027d pulled the envelope out of Surfer Killer\u0027s jacket herself, and had hardly let it out of her sight since. It was dimly possible - dimly - that one of the cops might have switched it while they\u0027d been holding it, but she didn\u0027t think so. She rubbed her aching forehead, folded up the letter and jammed it back into the envelope. Too late to worry about fingerprints or any other useful forensics. It has my name on it. That was a whole new level of creepy. The Cross Society was way creepy enough for her tastes; she felt out of her depth in dealing with them. This was... This was crazy. \"Where are we going?\" she asked. Borden didn\u0027t answer. After a few seconds, she looked over and saw that his eyes were shut, his breathing light and even. He couldn\u0027t be asleep, could he? No, he was just trying to piss her off. He was succeeding brilliantly. It was a long, long drive, and L.A. traffic was everything everyone had always said it would be. Being in a limo made it palatable but boring. Jazz stared out at the unmoving traffic. People in other cars were checking out the limousine\u0027s tinted windows, trying to imagine what celebrity was hiding within. She\u0027d have been right there with them, imagining George Clooney or Meryl Streep. Borden actually was asleep. Ridiculous as that seemed. She\u0027d been on the verge of shaking him awake to shout questions at him, but the truth was, she didn\u0027t think it would do any good, and she had an odd little soft spot for watching him this way. He had a lock of hair falling over his forehead, and her fingers itched to do something with it. Yank it by the roots, maybe. Or move it gently aside, light as a feather. The jury was still out and deadlocked. She was off balance, leaning forward to see what was available in the minibar - because, what the hell, how often was she actually going to be in a limousine and have unrestricted access? - when the limo moved forward, then jerked to a sudden stop. She ended up being pitched forward across Borden\u0027s knees. Well, that was embarrassing. She slowly straightened up without looking at him, although she could feel the sudden tension in the legs under her hands, which meant he was wide-awake. \"Something you wanted?\" he asked neutrally. His voice sounded rough and tight. \"Yeah,\" she said. \"Soft drink.\" She straightened up without actually looking at his face. They negotiated over brand names. He clinked ice into a crystal glass better suited to holding Scotch or bourbon and poured her a short little can of cola. He handed it over without comment. She drank, grateful for the syrupy rush, the liquid on her dry throat, and for something to do with her mouth other than get herself in even more trouble. Borden, awake, was much less readable than Borden, asleep. He looked at her from time to time as she drank, and stared out the windows. They hit smooth sailing after about fifteen more minutes, and Jazz made her drink last as long as possible before passing him the empty glass and last few melting cubes. He stowed it away without comment. \"It\u0027s not your fault,\" she said to him. \"No?\" He sounded so damn neutral. \"How do you figure that?\" \"If somebody above me had said, no, you need to lay back and let your friend get horribly murdered? Guess what. I would\u0027ve been forging documents and persuading you to help me, too. And I don\u0027t think you were wrong to do it. It\u0027s never wrong to save a life.\" \"No?\" he repeated. \"You\u0027d pull, say, John Wayne Gacy out of a river and start chest compressions.\" \"It\u0027d be easier if I didn\u0027t know he was a crazy murdering bastard, but yeah, that\u0027s pretty much the size of it.\" \"You\u0027d do it even if you knew. Even if you knew he was killing people.\" \"If I knew that, I\u0027d revive him and slap handcuffs on him before he could figure out what I was doing,\" she said. \"I\u0027m - I was a cop, Borden. I never tried to make myself judge, jury and executioner. That\u0027s a responsibility I don\u0027t want, and nobody should have unless they have checks and balances. That\u0027s what scares me about your dear friends in the Society. How do you know what they\u0027re doing is right? How can you really tell? Save that guy, let that guy die - \" She shook her head. \"I don\u0027t care what they think they know, I can\u0027t really believe they\u0027re ready to play God.\" He shook his head. \"I\u0027m not feeling guilty about saving Lowell,\" he said finally. \"I\u0027m angry at myself that you had to put yourself in danger to do it, and I\u0027m scared that this saving one life is going to cost me another, and I�CI\u0027m not ready to play God, either, Jazz. And if you die because of what I\u0027ve done - \" \"Hey,\" she murmured, and reached over to rest her hand on top of his. His fingers twitched, but didn\u0027t move to caress hers like they had in the car on the way to the airport in Kansas City. She missed it. \"I\u0027m a big girl. Even if I\u0027d known it would paint a target on my butt, I\u0027d have done it. You understand that, right?\" He shook his head and didn\u0027t answer at all. But he didn\u0027t move his hand from under hers for a long moment, either. When he finally did, when he folded his arms into a touch-me-not kind of defensiveness, she settled back in the opposite comfy corner and watched scenery flash by in silence. Desert. Lots of desert. She wanted to sleep, but something wouldn\u0027t let her. Borden didn\u0027t doze, either. She shot him looks from time to time, but his eyes were on the horizon, his face utterly blank and composed. Nothing to see here, move along. She saw a road sign flash by as the limo exited the freeway, and turned back in a futile attempt to be sure she\u0027d gotten that glimpse correct. \"Borden? We\u0027re going to a prison?\" \"Yes.\" \"Federal or state?\" \"Federal.\" \"Do I have to do the animal, mineral, or vegetable part of this quiz, too, or can we jump to the part where you tell me where the hell we\u0027re going and who we\u0027re going to see?\" Borden looked at the blank screen dividing them from the driver, evidently decided it was okay to talk, and said, \"We\u0027re going to see Max Simms.\" \"Simms?\" she echoed. \"Max Simms, the serial killer?\" \"No, Max Simms, the interior decorator. Why the hell do you think he\u0027s in prison? Yes, he was convicted of being a serial killer.\" Borden looked angry and ever so slightly sick. \"I helped defend him, remember? He\u0027s not guilty. I know he\u0027s not.\" She had a flash of sitting across from Ben McCarthy, separated by scarred Plexiglas, staring at his weary face and saying, It\u0027s okay, it\u0027s going to be okay, and knowing that it wouldn\u0027t be, knowing that every day he was behind bars was another day he\u0027d risk his life, his body, his mind. She felt responsible for that, and it hadn\u0027t been remotely her fault that he was imprisoned. If Borden felt the same, if he really believed Simms was innocent, that was a kind of slow, endless torture that she couldn\u0027t quite imagine. \"Do you think you lost the case? That it was really all your fault?\" \"No. Anyway, I was second chair. Laskins lost the case, if anybody did.\" Borden\u0027s tiny shrug went for casual and missed by a mile. \"Truth is, I don\u0027t think anybody could have gotten him acquitted. The evidence was too good.\" \"But you still think he\u0027s innocent.\" \"I didn\u0027t then,\" he admitted. \"I do now.\" \"Because...?\" \"I\u0027ve seen things,\" he said. \"I know things. I know how easy it is for events to be manipulated to someone else\u0027s gain, and I\u0027ve seen how ruthless Eidolon Corporation is. Simms was involved in a power struggle for control of the company. And he lost.\" She frowned, watching him, but he didn\u0027t have any more light to shed. The limo glided on until it braked to a smooth stop, and the door opened on golden sunset. The air held a tang of bitter sage and dry air, and as Jazz stepped out, dazzled, she had to shade her eyes from the glare. Everything looked bleached here - the sand, the pale uniforms on the guards, the buildings. Unlike some of the older prisons, no attempt had been made to make this one look like anything more than what it was: a big, solid concrete block to hold people inside. The exercise yard - a big flat paved expanse radiating waves of heat - was deserted, and a basketball roamed aimlessly around the tarmac, pushed here and there by swirling winds. The fences were chain-link topped with at least two feet of razor wire, with guard towers at regular intervals manned by snipers. Jazz hoped they had air-conditioning up there. The heat down here on the ground was murderous. \"This way,\" Borden said, and led the way to a gate manned by two armed deputies. They viewed her impersonally and checked a list for names, then buzzed her and Borden into a claustrophobic walkway. More chain-link and razor wire. Even McCarthy\u0027s prison didn\u0027t seem this daunting, but then, he was a state inmate, not federal. Two more checkpoints, and they were inside a dim, cool room that smelled of industrial cleaner and sweat. Three more deputies on duty, one a petite black woman who gestured Jazz over to one side. Jazz, without being asked, emptied out her pockets. The deputy lifted an eyebrow at the baton but said nothing. The pat-down was fast and professional. Jazz risked a glance over her shoulder to see Borden receiving the same treatment from a guy big enough to qualify for a Russian weightlifting team; he didn\u0027t look as if he was enjoying it much. His briefcase didn\u0027t make it. Neither did the contents of his pockets, or his cell phone. They joined up on the other side of a gate, where another deputy led them along rows of silent, darkened cells. \"What\u0027s with all the empty space?\" Jazz asked. \"Or are you telling me crime\u0027s actually down in California?\" The deputy - his name tag read Manning - gave her an unreadable look. \"Most prisoners have already been moved out to another facility,\" he said. \"Upstate. We\u0027ve only got two active pods right now. Your guy is in the second one.\" They weren\u0027t heading to the cells, though. The deputy turned them to the right, through an open iron-reinforced door, into a visiting room. Jazz felt a definite creep along her back. The place was deserted. It even smelled deserted. A soft-drink machine glowed and hummed at the far wall, but the lights were at half power, and the kids\u0027 area at the far side of the room with all its grimy, battered plastic toys lay silent and abandoned. The deputy grunted softly and flicked on a switch; fluorescents snapped on overhead, blindingly white. \"Where?\" Borden asked. He looked informal. She couldn\u0027t figure it out for a second, then realized that his tie was missing. Were they expecting him to hang himself? Or her to strangle him with it? Granted, the second part of that wasn\u0027t out of the question.... The deputy gestured widely toward the cubicles. There were six of them, all doors gaping open. All empty. \"Whichever,\" he said. \"Go on in. Press the button when you want out.\" Meaning that once they were inside, the door locked behind them. Jazz forced a smile and headed for cubicle number one. It didn\u0027t feel too bad until Borden crowded in with her, and then it was instantly too small, his heat too vivid against her skin. Their knees bumped as they tried to jostle their cheap plastic chairs for position. He muttered an apology as he elbowed her. She glared back. They both froze for a second as the lock snapped shut behind them, and their eyes darted into a shared gaze. In his, Jazz read the same undertone of panic and frustration she felt. She deliberately forced herself to relax, nodded at him and folded her hands in her lap. They sat in silence, waiting. The Plexiglas was scratched and warped, muddy with fingerprints. Some woman had kissed it at some point and left a smudged hooker-red imprint; Jazz itched to clean it. And if I want to clean it, she thought, this place really must be filthy. \"Jazz,\" Borden said. \"What?\" He was looking down at his right hand, which was curled into a loose fist on his knee. The top two buttons of his shirt were open, cotton hanging loose and limp around his long throat, and the skin there looked exposed and sleek and vulnerable. \"I got angry with you, before. I\u0027m sorry.\" Her lips parted, but nothing came out. She just stared at him. \"You need to quit doing this to yourself,\" he said. There was a strange tension in his voice. \"Hurting yourself. Jazz, you keep putting yourself in danger, and there\u0027s no reason for it. You throw yourself in the way of every speeding truck hoping to get run over, and sooner or later, you\u0027re going to - \" \"You think I\u0027m suicidal?\" she asked, astonished. His loose fist tightened. \"I think you blame yourself,\" he replied. \"For McCarthy either being innocent in prison, or being guilty in prison, and that\u0027s a no-win scenario. I think you don\u0027t see a way it isn\u0027t your fault, and that\u0027s bullshit. You need to quit assigning yourself the blame.\" She felt anger fill her up like boiling water. \"Look, Counselor, you don\u0027t know me, and I don\u0027t need your Psych One-oh-one crap about what I do or don\u0027t feel. You don\u0027t know Ben McCarthy, you don\u0027t know anything about - \" \"What makes you think I don\u0027t know Ben McCarthy?\" he interrupted, and met her eyes. Held them. \"What makes you think I don\u0027t know you?\" She had no defense for that. She resorted to pure fury, to reaching out and grabbing a handful of his jacket lapel and pulling him closer, but then the heat from his body washed over her and the smell of that warm, edible cologne, and the gentleness in his eyes... \"Jazz,\" he said, and she\u0027d never heard anyone say her name like that, with such infinite tenderness. \"If you hurt me again I\u0027m going to have to hurt you back. So please. Don\u0027t punch me, okay?\" She felt herself flush. \"I\u0027m not - I wasn\u0027t going to - \" She let go of his jacket, but they were still too close together, alarmingly close, and her heart was racing so fast she could barely feel individual beats. \"Back off, Counselor.\" \"You use that like a shield,\" he said. Still low and calm. \"My title. You can use my name, you know.\" \"Borden - \" \"I\u0027ve got another one.\" \"Fine, James. Back the hell off.\" But it didn\u0027t sound right, even to her ears. It sounded weak and fragile and oddly uncertain. \"Don\u0027t do this to me. Not now.\" He was so close his breath was stirring the hair around her face. His eyes were tired and bloodshot, his freshly shaved face pale with exhaustion. His smile, when it came, looked wounded. \"Do what? Worry about you? Care what happens to you?\" \"James - \" It slipped out before she could stop herself. Counselor and Borden, those were things she flung at him to keep him at bay. James was a name that felt intimate on her lips, and from the sudden flash in his eyes, he knew it. \"I don\u0027t need your help.\" \"I know,\" he said, and it was almost a whisper this time. \"You never need anybody\u0027s help.\" It was utterly insane, but she couldn\u0027t stop herself. She moved forward, a bare three-inch lunge, and kissed him. She felt him tense in surprise, then deliberately relax, and those lips she\u0027d been staring at for the past long minutes were warm and baby soft and damp against hers, and the heat she\u0027d been feeling that she thought was anger was turning into something else, a white-hot flare that burned down her spine and melted bone along the way. She started to pull back, but then Borden\u0027s lovely manicured hands slid up her arms and ruffled her hair and cupped the back of her head and, oh, my Lord, his mouth opened and his tongue, his tongue like hot velvet stroking her lips, then sliding inside... Somewhere on the other side of the Plexiglas came the harsh clang of a metal door slamming open. Jazz gasped and jumped back, shaking, tingling all over, staring at Borden, who looked just as stunned and ruffled as she felt. His lips were damp, still parted, a little swollen and red. She wanted to touch them. No, she wanted to devour them. Again. She swallowed hard, looked away and moved as far from him as it was possible to get in the narrow confines of the tiny cubicle. She heard him pulling in deep breaths, and out of her peripheral vision making fussy, nervous movements, smoothing his jacket, his shirt. I can\u0027t believe I did that. It already seemed like a strange daydream, and she might have convinced herself it hadn\u0027t happened at all, except that she could still taste him, still smell him on her skin and, oh, that felt so...good. \"Later,\" he said quietly. \"In your dreams,\" she shot back. Unsteadily. \"Yeah, I\u0027m almost certain that will happen, too.\" On the other side of the barrier, she heard jingling metal. Shuffling shoes. And then saw a shocking orange blaze of a jumpsuit - Jazz thought irrelevantly that Ben McCarthy was wearing the same color, right now - sidle awkwardly into the frame of the window. The legendary Max Simms had arrived. Where McCarthy filled out his prison garb in flat planes and intimidating angles, Simms was entirely different. Slender, lost inside the ill-fitting outfit, with giant blue eyes and wispy white hair and a face that looked gentle and sensitive and old before its time. He stood maybe five foot five, at most, and his shoulders were stooped like an arthritic ninety-year-old. It looked like his restraints weighed more than he did. He fixed those mild blue eyes on Borden, who had risen to his feet, and nodded. Borden returned the gesture and settled back on the very edge of his chair...and then Simms turned his attention to Jazz. It was like having all the air sucked out of the room. Like being in the center of the brightest spotlight in the universe, a beam so bright that she felt one instant away from combusting, so bright that there was no hiding in any corner because there were no shadows left, anywhere. Simms blinked, mild as milk, and settled into a plastic chair that a deputy thumped down on concrete for him on the other side of the glass. He rested his elbows on the table and flicked on the old-fashioned intercom on his side of the barrier. Borden reached over to turn on the one on their side of the glass. \"Mr. Simms,\" Borden said. \"Thank you for seeing us, sir. How are you?\" Simms nodded slightly, still staring at Jazz. She no longer felt that appalling rush of - of what? Focus? Intensity? - but she could feel herself shaking from the aftermath. \"It\u0027s good to see you again, James,\" he said. He had a pleasant, quiet voice, nothing remarkable. A little deeper than she\u0027d expected. \"I see you brought Ms. Callender with you.\" \"Had to,\" Borden said. \"There was a letter - \" \"Yes, I know,\" Simms said. \"May I see it? Just flatten it against the glass, if you don\u0027t mind.\" She fumbled it out of the envelope in her pocket, unfolded it and slapped it against the barrier for him to read. He had fussy little reading glasses that he fished out of his jumpsuit pocket and placed far down on his nose. His pale blue eyes moved in short jerks down the page. \"Ah,\" he murmured, and removed the glasses as he sat back. \"That\u0027s interesting, don\u0027t you think?\" \"The part about me getting killed? Yeah. I think it\u0027s pretty damn fascinating,\" she said, and folded the letter back into the envelope. \"Thanks for agreeing with me.\" He smiled. It looked like a nice, kindly sort of expression. \"I like you,\" he said. \"Why do you think I had them hire you?\" \"I don\u0027t understand how a guy who\u0027s behind bars for killing five people has the right to hire me to do anything,\" she said. \"And furthermore, you don\u0027t pay me, so far as I know.\" \"I set up the Cross Society,\" Simms said, eyebrows raised. \"Where did you imagine that money might have come from? Investments I made, with my own funds. So in a way, you continue to be paid by me, but you\u0027re quite right in legal terms. I haven\u0027t hired you. I have no assets, no rights, no existence beyond these walls, Jasmine. I rely on the friendship and goodwill of others.\" He sounded like the worst kind of con artist, the religious kind, the one bilking Ma and Pa Kettle out of their farm money while diddling little Ellie May out behind the barn. \"You don\u0027t get to call me Jasmine,\" she snapped, \"and I\u0027ve got no friendship and no goodwill for you, so let\u0027s cut to the chase. It was a long drive out here, I\u0027m tired, and I got myself pretty well beat up today, so if you don\u0027t mind - \" Simms looked up sharply, and the image she\u0027d been forming of him dissolved under the force of that gaze again. What the hell was that? It was like a storm in her head, a white-hot merciless laser boring right through everything she thought, everything she was.... \"Do you understand what an eidolon is?\" Simms asked, and didn\u0027t wait for her answer, as if he already knew it. \"It\u0027s the essence of a thing put into another form. The Greeks thought it a god made flesh, but it doesn\u0027t have to be a god, it can be anything that acts as a god. An avatar of power.\" \"Eidolon Corporation,\" she said. \"You named it that.\" \"I did,\" he admitted. \"I hired incredibly smart people to do research. To put some scientific framework around what I already knew to be true. I set the agenda, I directed the research, and I created a monster. A monster which turned on me, as you might have guessed.\" \"Fascinating,\" she said. \"What does that have to do with me?\" He blinked at her. \"You mean nobody\u0027s told you?\" \"Told me what?\" Simms\u0027s blue eyes took on a liquid shine, something eerie and strange. \"That you are one of the two people that I believe will bring down the beast. Bring down Eidolon, before it\u0027s too late.\" She cocked her head, shot a look from him to Borden and back. \"Too late for what?\" She was sure she was going to be sorry she\u0027d asked. She wasn\u0027t wrong. \"Too late to stop the end of life as we know it,\" Simms said, as if that made all the sense in the world. Crazy. This was crazy talk, and she felt trapped in this tiny airless room with Borden and this crazy man across from them. She ached all over and wanted to go home, crawl into bed and forget all of this. Give back the damn money, call it a day - \"How?\" she asked. \"Does it matter?\" Simms shrugged. \"It\u0027s the sort of thing you can\u0027t prove, Jasmine. If it happens, then there are no witnesses to testify. If it doesn\u0027t, well, no one can ever be certain I wasn\u0027t crazy.\" Crazy. Even he had the word in his head - or maybe he\u0027d picked it up out of hers. Maybe he really was some sideshow freak mind reader. \"Humor me,\" she said. \"Very well.\" Simms leaned his elbows on the table on his side of the glass, and the light slid over his pale, thin skin. She could see the cold pulse of blue veins underneath. \"I suppose you expect me to say something very movie-of-the-week, the new hot disaster terror in all the tabloids. Ebola, or some such. In fact, it\u0027s much more prosaic than that. War.\" \"War won\u0027t destroy life as we know it. It might kill a large number of people, but - \" \"Forgive me for my inexact description,\" Simms interrupted her, \"but I meant the destruction of human civilization. The world, of course, will continue. Damaged, fragile, but certainly not shattered beyond repair. But humans? It will take thousands of years to recover. Or, if there is another catastrophe, never.\" \"War,\" Jazz repeated flatly. \"That\u0027s it? Just war?\" \"You forget, Jasmine, we live in a time when killing has become a matter of engineering as much as brute force. We are only a few years from the implementation of machines capable of slaughter on a scale undreamed of fifty years ago, which was a quantum leap forward from the slaughter of fifty years before that. We live in an age of rapid acceleration.\" He shrugged again. \"I told you, it doesn\u0027t matter. Either it will happen or it won\u0027t, but in any case, it won\u0027t matter to the course of this conversation.\" Borden, next to her, was still and quiet and steady, as if he\u0027d already heard all this. Maybe he had. \"Okay, then,\" Jazz said. \"Tell me something concrete. Tell me why Lowell Santoro had to take one for your team. That\u0027s what it was, right? The Cross Society decided he was expendable. That\u0027s why Borden had to get me to help.\" \"Mr. Santoro\u0027s role is a bit complicated to explain, but I\u0027ll try. In six months, he will be instrumental in the making of a motion picture that changes the course of political campaigns in certain key states. That means that there will be increased funding in those key states to the military suppliers. Those suppliers will develop the weapons that I\u0027m speaking of. And so on.\" Jazz leaned back in her chair, staring at him. \"You\u0027re willing to kill a guy over a movie? Why not just kill the movie?\" \"I understand the concept of Actors and Leads has been explained to you?\" \"For all that I believe in it, yeah.\" \"The movie itself cannot be stopped. In every permutation of timeline that I have examined - and I have examined a vast number of them - the movie exists. What changes is the credibility of the movie. The people associated with it. And Santoro is the key to forming that group.\" Simms leaned even closer to the glass. His eyes looked almost transparent now, at close range. \"Understand me, Jasmine, I would have done it differently if I could have. We researched this for years, growing more and more desperate. Nothing changed. Santoro couldn\u0027t be separated from this project, nor it from him, with anything but lethal force.\" Jazz opened her mouth, but Borden beat her to it. \"So you got the opposition to do it for you,\" he said. \"You manipulated them into killing him.\" Simms didn\u0027t reply. He didn\u0027t even look at Borden, whose voice was low and tight with anger. He seemed fascinated by Jazz\u0027s stare. \"I manipulate everyone, my dear counselor,\" he said. \"It\u0027s all I have, you know. The power of suggestion, and responsibility. So yes, I did manipulate them. If you\u0027d left well enough alone, we wouldn\u0027t be having this conversation, but...\" Simms smiled, and there wasn\u0027t anything really kindly about it at all. \"But I thought you might do something like this. The odds were low, but definitely present. The others didn\u0027t see it, but I did. And that\u0027s a great pity, you know, because now Jasmine will pay the price. There\u0027s nothing I can do about it.\" He leaned back, eyelids lowering to hood his stare. \"You\u0027re saying - \" Borden began. \"I\u0027m saying that you\u0027ve ruined years of work,\" Simms said, \"and I\u0027m not pleased, James, not pleased. There are ways it can be fixed, but they\u0027ll cost me. I\u0027m not at all looking forward to the work.\" Jazz stared at him for a few seconds of silence, then reached up and pressed the red button. Somewhere, a buzzer went off. She stood up, banging her chair into Borden\u0027s knees, bringing him upright with her. \"What are you doing?\" he blurted, frowning. Simms merely looked at her, placid and unmoving, on the other side of the glass. \"Getting the hell out of here,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry, but this is bullshit. This guy is talking about seeing the future. Are you getting that, or does he have you so brainwashed you believe everything he says? Because frankly, Counselor, you seemed like a smarter guy than that to me.\" She slapped the red button again, impatiently. The buzzer continued to rattle somewhere outside. Simms said, very quietly, \"Don\u0027t be foolish. I knew where to find you, Jasmine. I knew where you would be when you didn\u0027t know you were going there. I know things about you that even your closest friends don\u0027t know. I can recite them to you, but I doubt you\u0027d want Counselor Borden to be privy to - \" She slapped the button again, rounded on him and leaned on the table to put her face close enough to the glass to fog it with her breath. \"Save it, asshole, I\u0027m not buying your sideshow crap. You had somebody follow me to the bar. Hell, for all I know, you had somebody switch envelopes on me just now at the police station. It\u0027s all crap, all right? And you\u0027re not going to convince me otherwise - \" \"At precisely ten-oh-two tonight,\" Simms said, \"Flight eight-oh-two, the plane you will be flying back to Kansas City, will suffer an engine failure. There will be two possible outcomes. One, the plane will rapidly lose altitude and crash into a row of suburban tract homes just short of the runway. There will be two survivors, a blond woman named Kelley Walters and a businessman, Lamar Qualls. Kelley will be traveling to visit her sister in Kansas City. Lamar will be visiting the city on business, to sign a contract for a grocery-store supply chain.\" She froze, staring at him. His eyes looked pellucidly clear. Sky blue. If he was lying, he was the best liar she\u0027d ever seen in her life. \"Bullshit,\" she said. But she wondered if it was. It was too specific, too definite. Liars liked to talk in generalities, not specifics that could be checked and disproved. \"Two,\" Simms continued as if she hadn\u0027t spoken, \"the pilot will be able to compensate for the loss of the engine and land the plane safely, without incident. There is an eighty-two percent chance that will be the case. I hope you find that comforting.\" \"So you\u0027re giving me a doom-and-gloom prediction that won\u0027t come true,\" she said. \"How convenient for you.\" \"I\u0027d say it\u0027s more convenient for you, actually,\" he said, \"considering that if I\u0027m wrong, you won\u0027t be one of the two survivors being carried out of the wreckage.\" He shrugged. \"I\u0027m not a fortune-teller. When I tell you these things, I\u0027m simply relaying what I know to be true based on my survey of possible futures. You can act on them, or not act. But altering the future is a delicate thing. If I send someone right now to the airport, for instance, and remove a certain mechanic from duty who is about to forget to tighten a bolt, then the engine problem doesn\u0027t occur at all. However, that sends events down another path, and I can\u0027t always see the consequences clearly from where I stand. Sometimes changing things makes them worse.\" \"What\u0027s worse than a plane crash?\" she asked. \"I assure you, you don\u0027t want to know,\" he answered, and craned his neck. \"Weren\u0027t you leaving?\" The buzzer shut down abruptly outside, and she felt a change in pressure and cool air on her back as a deputy yanked open the door behind her. It would be the easiest thing in the world to stalk out of here, leave Borden twisting in the wind. \"Don\u0027t you know what I\u0027ll do?\" she asked him. Simms smiled. \"There are a very few people in this world who are blank slates to me,\" he said. \"Those people bring random action to the game. You are one, or rather, you are one now. I predicted your actions somewhat accurately up until the night Laskins sent Borden to you with the offer, but unfortunately, you have grown more opaque since then. Your decisions drive events, Jazz. Yours, and Lucia\u0027s. That\u0027s why we call you Leads.\" \"Why?\" she flung at him. \"Why us? We\u0027re not important, are we? We\u0027re just - \" \"Pawns?\" Simms\u0027s mouth stretched in a wider smile. A much more unpleasant one, to Jazz\u0027s revulsion. \"Pawns win games, you know. And I\u0027d call you...knights. Perhaps one of you might even prove to be a queen, before this game is over.\" She balled up her fists on the cold, cracked Formica of the counter. \"If you\u0027re playing a game, who are you playing? Why can\u0027t you stay ahead?\" \"It should be obvious to you by now that I have an opponent,\" he said. His eyes flicked to focus behind her. \"I believe Officer Sanchez is waiting on you.\" Behind her, the deputy said, \"Yeah, I am. In or out, miss. I\u0027ve got things to do.\" She allowed herself to relax back into the chair, took a deep breath, and said, \"I\u0027ll stay. For a while.\" She felt the guard\u0027s shrug. \"Not going anywhere,\" he said, and the door clicked and locked again behind her. Bad decision, she thought instantly, and wondered from Simms\u0027s crazy point of view what kind of futures had just imploded or expanded. What factors had shifted. Which was just...nuts, wasn\u0027t it? To believe in a thing like that? \"You think you\u0027re playing Eidolon Corporation. Right?\" Simms glanced at Borden, who leaned elbows on the narrow table beside her and said, \"When Simms started trying to change the course of futures that he thought were dangerous, some people at Eidolon disagreed. Some of them for idealistic reasons, some for practical economic reasons. Eidolon is an inside-trader\u0027s dream. When you know the course of events, imagine how much profit there is to be made...but Simms didn\u0027t agree. So when push came to shove, Eidolon needed to lose Simms but decided that Simms\u0027s abilities were too valuable to let go. They found somebody as backup. Somebody with similar, ah, abilities.\" \"His name is Gilbert Kavanaugh,\" Simms said. \"Gil for short. You\u0027d like him, he\u0027s actually very amusing, for a psychopath.\" \"And let me get this straight. You claim to be able to see the future, and you didn\u0027t see it coming when he, what, framed you for murder?\" Simms nodded, a neat, economical motion. \"I told you. Certain people - \" \"Yeah, blank slates, yadda, yadda. You can\u0027t read his future?\" \"No.\" \"Or your own, I\u0027m guessing.\" Simms\u0027s smile was thin and discomforting. \"No.\" \"Or mine.\" \"Not at present. There are times yours is clear, and at others, not. Like Mr. Borden\u0027s. Like Lucia Garza\u0027s.\" \"Explain to me why you want to hire people whose actions you can\u0027t predict. Assuming this isn\u0027t a giant steaming pile of crap, of course.\" \"Of course. Because,\" Simms said very calmly, \"the ones I can predict cannot change anything. Their fates are set, for better or worse, unless one of the random pieces acts. I have gone to considerable trouble to hire all that I can, but of course Eidolon has deep pockets, as well.\" \"You\u0027re delusional.\" \"No.\" Simms shrugged. \"But I do think it is a wonder I\u0027m not insane, don\u0027t you?\" \"Five bodies buried in your backyard say different.\" Simms stared at her for a long, long moment, and she had that sensation again, as if a floodlight had swept over her and illuminated every cell in her body, every dark thought, every secret. It made her dangerously angry. \"Take her home, Counselor Borden,\" Simms said. He sounded suddenly tired, and not at all happy. \"I\u0027ve had quite enough excitement for one day, and I believe Gil is going to attempt another clever move before bedtime. I will need all my concentration to undo the mistakes of today.\" Borden reached across Jazz and punched the button. She knocked his arm away, rose to her feet and leaned both palms flat on the table, staring at Simms\u0027s small, pale face. \"I think you\u0027re full of crap,\" she said. \"We make our own choices, and you\u0027re just a con man and a murderer.\" Simms didn\u0027t smile this time. He looked thoroughly exhausted, as if the life was draining out of him. \"Part of that is always true some of the time,\" he said. \"And part of it is true all of the time. I leave it to you to decide how to divide the statement. It\u0027s been lovely to meet you, Jasmine.\" \"It\u0027s not mutual,\" she said, and turned toward the door as it opened behind her. Moving into the larger room with its harsh fluorescent glare and empty ringing silence felt like escape, as if she\u0027d been under some threat she hadn\u0027t identified. She looked back. Borden was still standing there, speaking softly to Simms. As she watched, Simms nodded, stood up and shuffled away with a deputy at his side. Borden looked grim and angry, and he didn\u0027t say a word as they followed their own deputy back past empty cells and through sally ports. They both spoke in monosyllables as they signed papers and collected their belongings again, then were escorted back into the harsh desert sunshine. The car was still waiting, idling in the falling darkness. When they were back on the road, Borden clicked open his briefcase, rooted around in it for a second, and then handed her a plane ticket. Flight 802. Los Angeles to Kansas City. \"He didn\u0027t know,\" Borden said. \"I didn\u0027t tell him we were flying back tonight, and there\u0027s no way he could have known which flight we were on. Think about that.\" She gave him a long, considering look, and said, \"And if I were a half-decent con man, I might know how many flights there were to K.C. from LAX in a day, if my mark was heading there. I might make a pretty educated guess as to which one she\u0027d be on, given the time of day. Looks like magic. Smells like crap, Counselor. Sorry. No sale.\" He shook his head and avoided her eyes. She licked her lips and suddenly - shockingly - remembered the warm pressure of his mouth, and felt something in her plummet again, lost and liking it. It\u0027s a long ride back to L.A., some part of her whispered. She tracked it down and throttled it into silence. Borden said something under his breath that sounded like, \"He said you\u0027d be like this,\" and they spent the entire ride back in silence. Not touching. To Jazz\u0027s well-concealed disappointment.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-bargain-red-letter-days-1/page-8.html","bookId":2310,"book":{"id":2310,"title":"Devil\u0027s Bargain (Red Letter Days #1)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Bargain (Red Letter Days #1) Jasmine \"Jazz\" Callender is on the downhill slide to ruin.
