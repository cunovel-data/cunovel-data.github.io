{"id":95640,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Two hours later, they had a catered lunch in a quiet, cavelike boardroom, with indirect lighting and a silently playing plasma-screen TV showing the latest disaster footage on one of the news channels. Just her, Lucia and Borden; Counselor Laskins hadn\u0027t returned from his other meeting, thank God, so they were able to order sandwiches instead of some impress-the-boss spread. Jazz stuck to tuna fish and low-fat chips. Lucia did her one better with a salad, dry, which Jazz guessed was what it took to maintain that statuesque perfect shape.\n She had a cookie in retaliation.\n Borden sat next to her, still thumbing through the paperwork as he gobbled down a roast beef on wheat, dripping with mayo. \"Not that I want to rush you,\" he said, \"but my boss is bound to bring up the fact that I\u0027m burning billable hours waiting for you to make up your minds. Any decision yet?\"\n Lucia had her copy of the partnership agreement in front of her, and she flipped pages and scratched notes on a legal pad as she speared lettuce. \"No.\"\n \"Afraid not,\" Jazz said. She had another mouthful of tuna salad, which was excellent, packed with walnuts and celery and some kind of lemon spice. \"We\u0027re going to need time.\"\n \"How much?\"\n \"We\u0027re not signing anything today,\" Lucia said. \"We have to get back later this afternoon, we\u0027ll be in touch. You understand, we have to be sure about this.\"\n \"I\u0027d never advise you to sign anything you weren\u0027t sure about. Still, we do have some cases coming up, and we\u0027d like to have you on them.\"\n \"Very flattering,\" Jazz said, \"but I\u0027m not sure you\u0027re going to get us. Yet.\"\n She got a full-on stare from his brown eyes, and remembered how he\u0027d been in the bar - off base, off balance, awkward. Out of his element but determined enough to tough it out. She\u0027d liked that Borden. This one - slick, sophisticated and in control - was less easy to trust.\n \"Your choice,\" he said neutrally. \"But just remember, I picked out the cookies personally.\"\n Lucia snorted.\n Jazz took a second one and ate it contemplatively, watching him.\n He suddenly rolled his leather chair back and said, \"Jazz, can I have a minute? Just one minute.\"\n She looked at Lucia, who raised her eyebrows in an eloquent whatever. Jazz stood up and fisted her hands in her jacket pockets. \"Sure, Counselor.\"\n He led her out into the hallway. Instead of turning toward his office, which was two doors down, he took her to the right, to the big indoor garden with its quietly tinkling fountain and elaborately raked Zen sand. He walked her down the path to a blind corner shielded by a broad-leafed palm. There was a stone bench, but he made no move to sit down. He was staring at the tops of his shoes.\n \"Well?\" she asked finally. \"Nice plants. What else?\"\n \"I know you don\u0027t trust us,\" he said. He didn\u0027t seem to know what to do with his hands, and the awkwardness made her remember how he\u0027d been back in K.C., at the bar. Standing up to two men when it was a foregone conclusion he was in for an ass-kicking. For a lawyer, he sure didn\u0027t lack spine. \"But...please believe me when I say that you need to try to believe me. Things are coming. Bad things. And I don\u0027t want you to get hurt.\"\n She felt a sudden chill and stepped closer, trying to get his eyes. He avoided her. \"Borden?\"\n \"Look, I can\u0027t tell you anything. But things are going to happen, and I\u0027d rather you were inside than out. Right? For your sake as well as ours.\"\n \"Are you trying to threaten me?\"\n That got her a stare, a big wide one, shocked. \"No! Of course not. Besides...hell, I\u0027ve seen you kick ass, Jazz. Threatening you is the last thing on my mind, believe me. I\u0027m just...worried.\"\n \"What have you heard?\"\n \"That there were men after you in the airport,\" he said. \"Jazz, you were in danger from the minute I walked into that bar and handed you that envelope, just like Lucia was in danger the moment hers was delivered. I wish I could make this easy for you. I can\u0027t. It isn\u0027t just...money and opportunity. This is about something else.\"\n The Cross Society. And Eidolon Corporation?\n \"About what?\" she asked, instinctively. Keeping her voice down. He was almost whispering. \"Borden? About what?\"\n \"Time,\" he said. \"We\u0027re almost out of it.\"\n He was wearing the same aftershave as he had at the bar, she realized suddenly. It radiated off him in warm waves, and she had to fight an impulse to breathe in deeply. She\u0027d stepped closer again without realizing it. Inches from him. He was stooped, looking down into her eyes. She\u0027d always considered herself pretty stocky, but he made her feel delicate, somehow.\n She felt his fingers brush hers, then slowly enfold her hand in warmth.\n \"Watch yourself,\" he said softly. \"Even if you don\u0027t do this thing, you need to be careful. You\u0027re on their radar now.\"\n \"They, who?\"\n He shook his head but never looked away from her face. The gaze was getting deeper. More intense. She felt her breath coming faster and struggled to slow it down. Warmth was creeping up her arm, and her hand felt unnaturally sensitized, as if she could feel every whorl in his fingerprints on her skin.\n \"Counselor,\" she said slowly, \"are you trying to come on to me?\"\n That got a sudden, brilliant grin. \"Why, would it work?\"\n \"I don\u0027t do lawyers.\"\n \"We\u0027re even. I don\u0027t do cops.\"\n \"Ex-cop.\"\n \"Too bad I\u0027m a current lawyer.\"\n \"So where does that leave us?\"\n He didn\u0027t answer. Silence fell, deep as the Zen pool. Mist drifted through the garden and brushed the back of her neck with damp fingers, and she shivered.\n \"Nowhere,\" she finally murmured, and pulled away. He let her do it without a fight. \"Also? One more thing. If I find out you\u0027re behind those assholes at the airport, your ass is mine.\"\n She was executing a perfect Hollywood exit when he murmured plaintively, \"But that was my plan! The ass thing, not the other part.\"\n She didn\u0027t give him the satisfaction of turning around. She walked away down the stone path, back to the conference room. Lucia was finishing her salad.\n Jazz picked up her purse and the partnership agreement, and said, \"I need some air.\"\n Lucia neatly speared the last cherry tomato, forked it into her mouth, and nodded. \"Time to go, anyway. I expect we\u0027ve worn out our welcome.\"\n Borden, still standing in the garden, nodded to them as they left, but never said another word. Jazz wasn\u0027t sure whether to be angry or hurt by that, but really, when it came down to it, there was only one logical choice.\n Anger at least kept you sharp.\n \"Well?\"\n They were somewhere over Illinois, heading toward Missouri, when Lucia asked the single-word question. Jazz, who\u0027d been drifting steadily toward nap land, came awake with a hard jolt. The drone of the airplane filled her ears, and she glanced out the window to make sure they were still flying, not falling. So far, so good.\n Lucia was nursing a drink. It fizzed, so it was probably sparkling water, something suave and European. Jazz flagged down the flight attendant and got a Sprite, which she figured was the Americanized version.\n \"Am I in favor?\" Jazz asked. Lucia inclined her head. \"Honestly? I don\u0027t know. But, presuming it checks out...\"\n \"And if your friend Manny doesn\u0027t turn up anything unusual...\"\n \"Then I\u0027d say maybe we should seriously consider it.\" The money. The thought of that crisp, cashable check in her wallet made Jazz\u0027s mouth go dry.\n Lucia closed the partnership agreement and stared down at the cover, which was embossed with the logo of Gabriel, Pike \u0026 Laskins, LLP. She rubbed a finger over it, silently, and then nodded. Just a bare inch of agreement. \"Maybe,\" she said. \"Where would we have the office?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"The office,\" Lucia repeated. \"Garza \u0026 Callender Investigations. Where do we hang the shingle?\"\n Against all reason, Jazz found herself grinning. \"K.C.\u0027s a nice town,\" she said.\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s not bad.\"\n \"But it\u0027d be Callender \u0026 Garza. Alphabetical order.\"\n \"Age before beauty.\"\n \"Pearls before - \"\n \"Oh, I wouldn\u0027t if I were you.\" Lucia took a sip of her water. The flight attendant arrived with a small plastic cup of fizzing Sprite on the rocks, and passed it across to Jazz.\n They looked at each other mutely for a few seconds, and then Jazz held up the Sprite. Lucia held up the sparkling water.\n They clinked plastic.\n \"Deal,\" Lucia said.\n \"If there\u0027s nothing hinky that turns up.\"\n \"Obviously. Goes without saying.\"\n The Sprite tasted cool and refreshing, like champagne. That\u0027s it, Jazz thought with a sudden surge of mingled dread and euphoria, as the plane started its descent for Kansas City. Something just changed.\n She hoped it was for the better.\n Two independent attorneys had reviewed and signed off on the partnership agreement - and one of them called it a \"work of art\" - by the time Manny got back to them with the forensic results. \"I was thorough,\" he explained to Jazz on the cell phone. \"I got nothing off the letter.\"\n \"Nothing?\" she repeated, startled. She was standing in the lobby of the second law firm, one selected at random from the phone book, and Lucia was in the restroom. The partnership agreement, well thumbed, was lying in front of her on the coffee table, decorated with grubby yellow sticky notes. \"What do you mean, nothing?\"\n \"Well, I mean that the paper\u0027s consistent with the official letterhead of Gabriel, Pike \u0026 Laskins - I had their nice receptionist courier me some pieces - and the fingerprints on the paper are yours, one James R. Borden, and a woman named Pansy Taylor, who is his - \"\n \"Assistant, yeah, I\u0027ve met her.\"\n \"She\u0027s really named Pansy?\"\n \"Apparently. What else?\"\n Manny shuffled papers noisily on the other end of the phone. She checked the number he was calling from, and saw a caller-ID-blocked message. He was probably phoning from the lab, but with Manny, you could never tell. Even with all of the delicate equipment and lush lifestyle, he\u0027d been known to pull up stakes and move in less than a day. All it takes is money, he\u0027d told her once, with a shrug. She supposed that was true.\n \"The blood on the note? A positive. Not your type.\"\n I don\u0027t know about that, she thought, and suppressed it. \"Borden\u0027s,\" she said. \"Did you do a DNA test?\"\n \"You said the full ride, Jazz. Yes. DNA profile. I don\u0027t know what good it will do you, but it\u0027s here. You\u0027ll be pleased to know he\u0027s not your long-lost brother or anything.\"\n She was, actually. \"So there\u0027s nothing you can tell me about this letter? Nothing hinky?\"\n \"Hinky?\" Manny was silent for a few seconds. \"No. Not about the letter.\"\n \"But...?\"\n \"It\u0027s the envelope.\"\n The big red Valentine\u0027s Day envelope. \"What about it?\"\n \"Two sets of fingerprints on the envelope, besides yours and Borden\u0027s. Not Pansy Taylor\u0027s.\"\n Jazz tried to remember if either of the truckers had touched it. No, she was pretty sure they hadn\u0027t. \"Get any hits?\"\n \"Actually, yeah,\" he said. \"One of the sets belongs to a guy named Bernard Lozano, he was sent up for assault ten years ago, but he\u0027s been out a couple of years now. I didn\u0027t get anything off of the other set.\"\n Maybe the trucker twins had touched the envelope, after all. The name Lozano wasn\u0027t ringing any bells with her. \"Okay. Anything else?\"\n \"Ink, paper, blood. That\u0027s all you gave me, Jazz. Not a lot to work with here.\"\n \"I get it, Manny. Thanks.\"\n He grunted. \"You\u0027ll get the bill. Oh, and don\u0027t come by for a while. I don\u0027t like the company.\"\n \"Manny!\"\n \"Not you, Jazz. The other guys.\"\n She felt a sudden chill and clutched the phone tighter. \"What other guys?\"\n \"The ones who pulled up in a van and sat surveillance outside my building for two hours after you left,\" Manny said. \"I had to move. New address is in the usual place.\"\n He dead-dropped his address and phone numbers into a post office box when he got paranoid. Jazz had been through it before. \"I\u0027ll pick them up once I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not being tailed.\"\n \"I thought you were sure the last time.\"\n I was. She didn\u0027t tell him that. \"Sorry, Manny.\"\n \"Yeah, well, there\u0027s a bump in your bill for it.\" He hesitated. Static crackled the phone. \"The other woman? The one you brought here?\"\n \"Lucia?\" Who was, as it happened, coming out of the bathroom and heading her way.\n \"I liked her,\" Manny said. \"She can come around if she wants.\"\n He hung up before she could say another word. She blurted, \"You\u0027re kidding me!\" but it was lost to the ether.\n \"What?\" Lucia asked, sinking down to the couch beside her.\n \"Manny likes you,\" Jazz said. \"You have no idea how deeply weird that is.\"\n Lucia smiled and shrugged. \"People like me. It\u0027s a gift.\"\n \"Manny\u0027s got nothing hinky, except two sets of prints, one belonging to one Bernard Lozano, ex-con, on the outside of the envelope.\"\n \"And the letter?\"\n \"Clean. I\u0027ve also asked him to look into the Cross Society, but it\u0027ll take time.\"\n Lucia hitched her shoulders wordlessly. She tapped the partnership agreement with one high-gloss fingernail. For someone who\u0027d been living out of a very small suitcase for two days, she looked fresh from the showroom. Jazz, who\u0027d had access to everything in her own apartment, hadn\u0027t managed to achieve much more than comfortable and awake. I need a haircut, she thought, swiping the shag out of her eyes again. Lucia\u0027s hair always stayed where it was told. But then it was that glossy, silky black, and Jazz\u0027s was coarse and blond and not very damn cooperative, in general.\n She was thinking of these things to avoid the next step, she realized. Lucia was watching her.\n \"Look,\" Jazz said, \"I\u0027m not going to lie to you. I need the money. I need it to pay for Ben\u0027s appeal. I want to sign this thing.\"\n \"Jazz, I\u0027m not judging you. But these people know you need the money. It\u0027s a lever.\"\n \"And you don\u0027t need it, do you?\"\n Lucia shook her head. \"That\u0027s not what they\u0027re offering me.\"\n \"Then what?\"\n \"Independence.\"\n Jazz had had a bellyful of that. \"It\u0027s not all it\u0027s cracked up to be.\"\n \"It is when you\u0027ve spent half your life trusting your life to pinheads who have no idea how to plan their way out of their offices,\" Lucia replied, grim lines around her eyes and mouth. \"I don\u0027t mind fighting for the right things. I mind being wasted. I want to set my own priorities for a change.\"\n There was a passion behind the words that surprised Jazz. A frustration carefully hidden behind Lucia\u0027s glossy, composed surface. She met the other woman\u0027s dark eyes and saw an absolute fury there, quickly damped down.\n \"Lucia, we either do this thing or we don\u0027t. I don\u0027t have a lot of time to burn.\" She was thinking about Ben, sitting in a cell, waiting. When she\u0027d seen him last, he\u0027d been quiet and guarded, but she\u0027d seen the bruises. A cop in general population. He was a target, and there was no question that his enemies would get him. Ben was tough, but he wasn\u0027t a superman, and even the tough had to sleep. \"I need this.\"\n Lucia took a breath deep enough to stretch the pin-striped tailored jacket she was wearing. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" There was a cold, hard light in her eyes. \"I know you do. But I\u0027ve been thinking about it, and it just doesn\u0027t feel right. I did some checking on the Cross Society. You know who first established it? Max Simms.\"\n \"Simms? The serial killer?\"\n \"When he was the head of Eidolon Corporation, he formed the Cross Society as a nonprofit. He was head of it for a year before they started digging up bodies in his basement. The only thing that saved the society from going down the toilet was that he kept his involvement with them strictly low-profile, and somebody else stepped in to run it when he was shipped off to prison. Although my informant says that Simms was mostly a figurehead, anyway. The Cross Society was just a way to funnel money out of Eidolon. Apparently, Simms wasn\u0027t getting along with his board of directors.\"\n Jazz looked her right in the eyes. \"Then this isn\u0027t going to happen,\" she said.\n \"No,\" Lucia agreed. \"It isn\u0027t going to happen. I\u0027m sorry. I know you wanted it. I wanted it, too. But not if it tangles us up with people like Max Simms.\"\n Jazz felt it all turn to ash, all the hope she hadn\u0027t even realized she\u0027d been nursing. She\u0027d schooled herself not to feel, not to care, and she\u0027d been suckered in this time, and it damn well hurt. She stared mutely at Lucia, who stood up, retrieved her designer purse, and said, \"Can you take me to the airport?\"\n Jazz nodded silently. She gathered up the partnership agreement, rolled it up and stuffed it into her coat pocket.\n That was it. Game over.\n Borden was going to be very disappointed.\n Jazz kept her head down, thinking, all the way down in the elevator to the parking level. Lucia didn\u0027t speak, either. There was an awkward silence between them, and they couldn\u0027t meet each other\u0027s eyes.\n It was a relief when the bell dinged to announce Parking Level 2, and they could escape from being too close. Jazz put several feet between them as they headed for her car, two rows down.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Jazz. I like you. I\u0027d like to work with you someday,\" Lucia said. It was quiet, almost lost in the squeal of tires of a car pulling out of its space down the row. Headlights washed over them, turning Lucia\u0027s rich golden skin pale, pulling diamond glints from her earrings, and since Jazz was watching her, she saw the other woman\u0027s eyes suddenly shift to focus behind her.\n She knew that look. She felt it in a swift, hot prickle down her spine, and she was diving forward even before Lucia yelled \"Gun!\" and lunged for the cover of a pillar. Jazz hit the ground hard and rolled, feeling the bite of rough concrete on exposed skin; she banged up hard against the massive tire of an oversize SUV and rolled on her side, fumbling for her gun.\n A spray of noise, and sparks off the concrete next to her. She yelped, twisted and aimed for muzzle flashes. They were coming from the window of a slow-moving car, a black Lincoln with tinted windows. Everything was moving in snapshots, freeze-frames divided by the rapid gasps of her breath. More muzzle flashes, and bullets peppered the ground and the cars and the pillar behind which Lucia had taken shelter. Four rapid sharp pops, and she saw gray-rimmed holes appear in the passenger-side door. Lucia was firing. Jazz steadied her hand and squeezed off six shots. Every one of them went through the open window. She couldn\u0027t tell if she hit anyone.\n The gun - a Mac 10 - disappeared back inside the window, and the car became a blur as it accelerated away. She focused on the license plate, but it was smeared, too, oddly indistinct. Tape? Some kind of disguise. They\u0027d probably stop and peel it off later.\n And then it rounded the corner with a screech, struck sparks as it hit the ramp going up, and was gone.\n Smoke hung heavy in the air, acrid, burning Jazz\u0027s eyes as she blinked and coughed. Well, it\u0027s certainly one of the fastest firefights I\u0027ve ever been in.\n She focused on the glittering cascade of castoff on the ground. There must have been fifty shells, maybe more. Some were still rolling. The whole garage reverberated with the sounds of war.\n \"Shit!\" Lucia was suddenly beside her, pale and furious, black eyes wide. She was staring at the ramp, and the gun was still in her hand. Tiny little thing. Ladylike.\n \"You need a bigger gun,\" Jazz said, and laughed. It didn\u0027t sound right. Lucia looked down at her, and stopped breathing. \"What?\"\n Lucia went down on one knee, never mind the expensive pantsuit, and put the gun on the ground to flip Jazz over on her back. \"Hey!\" Jazz protested, but everything felt odd, didn\u0027t it? Strange and liquid and...\n Lucia pressed both hands to her side, pushing so hard Jazz couldn\u0027t breathe.\n \"You\u0027re going to be all right,\" Lucia said. \"Jazz. You\u0027re going to be all right.\"\n Oh, shit, Jazz thought numbly, and saw the blood flooding over Lucia\u0027s hands.\n She fumbled in her coat pocket, got her cell phone, and dialed 911 to report her own shooting.\n Lucia was right, although Jazz didn\u0027t think it had been an actual diagnosis. Sometimes optimism worked out. The bullet had passed through her side and caught a few minor blood vessels, missed her liver and kidneys, and come out the other side. The doctor - way too young to be a surgeon, in Jazz\u0027s painkiller-altered opinion - was cheerful about it. \"Seen lots worse,\" he told her, patting her hand. \"I have three guys downstairs who had an argument in a bar who wish they were you, I promise.\"\n \"How long am I going to be stuck here?\" she asked. She hated hospitals. Hated the stiff, starchy sheets, the smell of disinfectant, the clean doctors. Hated the idea that she was lying in a bed that had probably seen more dead people than that kid in The Sixth Sense. Emergency rooms always smelled like blood and vomit, no matter how carefully they were scrubbed. \"If I\u0027m all stitched up...\" She eased a leg over the side of the bed. And almost passed out. Ow. He grabbed it and moved it back.\n \"You\u0027re here overnight,\" he said. \"And there are some police who want to talk to you. They\u0027re already talking to your friend.\"\n Jazz had figured that. She could safely guess that what Lucia was saying was the truth, just not the whole truth. The two of them had been to the lawyers\u0027 offices to consult about a partnership agreement. They\u0027d been jumped by persons unknown. Case closed. Jazz figured she could leverage being shot to keep her statement short and sweet. If she had any luck at all, maybe she wouldn\u0027t know the cops, and this would be...\n Behind the doctor, the big wood door eased open, and a slightly built guy in a cheap suit looked in. He had rough-cut spiked hair and cold dark blue eyes and a rubbery mouth that looked as if it might smile or smirk or scream at a moment\u0027s notice.\n He looked at her as if she might be a corpse ready for autopsy, nothing but clinical interest.\n Apparently, luck was not on her side. God, she really didn\u0027t feel well enough for this.\n \"Stewart,\" she said with a noticeable lack of warmth. He blinked at her. \"You going to skulk or come in?\"\n \"Skulk,\" he said. \"How you doin\u0027, Jazz?\" He had a Bronx accent, usually stressed for effect, and she felt a familiar weary surge of dislike. Poser. She\u0027d known him for nearly five years, and she\u0027d never liked him one minute of that time.\n \"Shot,\" she replied shortly.\n \"Yeah, so I hear. Doc, can I...?\" He gestured from himself to Jazz. The doctor shrugged, stuck his hands in his lab-coat pockets and sauntered out. Stewart - Kenneth Stewart, not that she\u0027d ever called him by his first name or ever intended to - pulled up a chrome-and-plastic chair next to her bed and sat down. He poked the IV bag with a fingertip and didn\u0027t look at her as he said, \"So. Long time no see.\"\n \"Yeah.\" She didn\u0027t want small talk. Her head hurt, and her side was starting to really ache. She suspected the painkillers were more Motrin than morphine. \"You already talked to my friend?\" She didn\u0027t give him the name. If Lucia wanted to go undercover, she wasn\u0027t about to blow it for her.\n \"Friend?\" he repeated blankly. Poked the IV bag again, then rang a fingernail off the screen of the heart monitor. \"Oh, yeah. Luz something. Hermann\u0027s talking to her. Pretty girl. I think I got the short straw.\"\n \"Me, too.\" Not that Stewart\u0027s partner Hermann was any great prize, either. \"I want another detective. I\u0027m not talking to you.\"\n \"Fuck you, Callender.\" It wasn\u0027t a casual, off-the-cuff insult between friends. This was a gut-deep venting of feelings, and she felt the menace behind it.\n \"Same to you, Stewart.\" A hot pulse of fury along her spine. Her hand curled into a tight fist, and relaxed. Much as she wanted to kick his punk ass, there was no way she could do it dressed in a backless gown with a through-and-through bullet hole in her side.\n \"So, did anything happen to you I need to know about?\" Stewart asked in a bored tone.\n \"This is how you conduct an investigation?\"\n \"It is when I know the witness is a lying bitch who wouldn\u0027t know the truth if it bit her in the - where were you shot exactly?\"\n \"See my previous fuck you comment. Fine, if we\u0027re done, get the hell out. I don\u0027t want to look at your ugly face anymore.\"\n Without looking at her, he reached over and put his hand on her side. Over the bandages. \"Does it hurt?\"\n She didn\u0027t move. Those twilight-blue eyes - on anybody else they might have been pretty - focused on her face, and his mouth stretched into a vindictive grin. He patted her bullet wound. Not gently. She bit the inside of her mouth to keep from wincing.\n \"Want to hear my theory?\" Stewart wasn\u0027t moving his hand. \"I think some of McCarthy\u0027s drug-dealing asshole buddies decided to send him a message by putting a few caps in his ex-partner. It was a classic drive-by hit, you know. Big dark pimp car, full auto spray. You\u0027re just lucky, is all. But then, you get lucky a lot, don\u0027t you? I\u0027ve never seen anybody as lucky as you.\"\n He pressed harder. Jazz knew she was going pale, but she didn\u0027t look away from his stare.\n \"Maybe if you\u0027d tell the truth,\" Stewart said, \"you\u0027d quit being a target. This isn\u0027t the first trouble you\u0027ve gotten into, since you turned in your shield. Is it?\"\n One attempted firebombing of her apartment, which had failed when the glass bottle full of gasoline hadn\u0027t shattered on impact, and she\u0027d been able to scramble over and drag the burning rag out of the mouth of it. She could still smell the bitter tang of the gas, the smoky, oily cloth. No prints on the bottle, according to police forensics. She still wished she\u0027d taken it to Manny. She was pretty sure he\u0027d have come up with something to trace it back to Stewart.\n She\u0027d also been jumped coming out of a bar downtown. Two guys with knives. If she hadn\u0027t been drunk, she\u0027d have had them, but even so, she\u0027d managed to put them on the run. No good description, though. She\u0027d always wondered if the small one had been Stewart himself.\n \"I hear that you were just minding your own business and this car rolled up on you. You fired six shots back, your friend fired four, and the car took off. That correct?\"\n \"Don\u0027t know. Count the shells.\"\n \"Oh, we will.\" He nodded. \"And Jazz? If I catch you in a lie, you\u0027re mine.\"\n He squeezed this time. Hard. Fingers digging into her stitched-up side.\n She couldn\u0027t keep from gasping, but she didn\u0027t just lie there for it, which was what he must have expected. She came straight up in bed and stiff-armed the heel of her hand into his nose.\n Pop.\n Stewart\u0027s head snapped back, and he fell off his chair, rolled to his knees and staggered back to his feet. He caught himself with a hand on an IV stand, which rolled, and for a happy second she thought he might go down again. No such luck. He felt his nose with his other hand, sniffed, and glared at her.\n No blood. Too bad. She\u0027d been hoping for a broken nose, at least.\n \"Sorry,\" she said. \"Reflex.\"\n He didn\u0027t say anything, just stared at her for a burning second, then turned and walked out of the room. The door slammed hard behind him.\n Jazz let out a long breath and closed her eyes. Her forehead felt damp, and now that the crisis was over, she was shaking. And sick to her stomach. She pushed the button for on-demand morphine.\n Just what she didn\u0027t need. A bullet in her side, no partnership agreement, and a closer acquaintance with Kenneth Stewart.\n Lucia came back twenty minutes later, looking not exactly grim but definitely tense. She took the chair that Stewart had dragged close, gave Jazz a long look, and said, \"I don\u0027t like this.\"\n \"Hospitals? Hey, I\u0027m not a fan of them, either. And I think I have more reason to bitch about it.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t like that they knew where to find us.\" She wasn\u0027t talking about the hospitals, or even Stewart. \"I\u0027ve been watching for tails. So have you.\"\n \"So we missed one. Or they\u0027ve got some high-tech tracking bug on us.\" She remembered Borden, walking into Sol\u0027s Bar without any reason to be there. That still bothered her.\n \"No, I\u0027ve swept us and the car for bugs,\" Lucia said, and combed sleek silky hair back from her face in a distracted motion. \"Nothing. There\u0027s no way they\u0027ve retasked a satellite just to follow us around, so if they\u0027re not doing line-of-sight surveillance, then they shouldn\u0027t know where we are. And if they were doing line-of-sight, we should have spotted them.\"\n \"Unless they\u0027re good.\"\n \"More than just good. I\u0027m good.\" Lucia definitely looked stressed, as if she felt responsible for Jazz lying here, leaking fluids. \"Those cops - I take it not friends of yours? - aren\u0027t investigating, they\u0027re filling out paperwork.\"\n \"It\u0027s Stewart,\" Jazz said, and stared up at the ceiling. It was blank, white, and noninspirational. \"He helped put McCarthy away. He\u0027s been gunning for me ever since. No, actually, I take that back. He\u0027s never liked me. He\u0027s just actively started hating me since the whole thing with Ben.\"\n Lucia paused in the act of tying her hair back with a businesslike black elastic band. No scrunchies or decorations for her. She looked different with her hair back. Harder. Jazz approved. \"About McCarthy...\" Lucia began.\n \"No.\"\n \"You don\u0027t think we should discuss that?\"\n \"No, we\u0027re not talking about Ben, or his case, or whether or not he\u0027s guilty, or what he has to do with this because I guarantee you, he\u0027s got nothing to do with it. He\u0027s in prison, Lucia. Let\u0027s leave him out of this.\"\n Lucia didn\u0027t answer that, just finished wrapping her hair in the elastic with a snap. \"I called your sister, told her you\u0027d been in an accident.\"\n \"Oh, no.\" Jazz sighed. \"What did Molly say?\"\n Lucia avoided her eyes. \"She was concerned. She said she\u0027d tell your dad.\"\n \"I bet. I\u0027ll expect a cheap floral arrangement delivered to the wrong address next week.\"\n \"She\u0027s not that bad.\"\n \"Bullshit.\"\n \"Manny wanted to visit, but - \"\n \"He\u0027s got a thing about hospitals. Manny has a thing about everything.\"\n \"He did some good work for us, looking into the Cross Society.\"\n \"And?\"\n Lucia shrugged. \"On paper, it\u0027s legit. He came up with a few flags - not so much red lights as yellow. Max Simms, for one. He may be in prison, but it\u0027s likely he\u0027s still got some influence.\" She fell silent. The moment stretched, long and awkward.\n Jazz though longingly of on-demand morphine.\n \"You should go,\" Jazz said. \"I\u0027m sorry to have kept you hanging around. You\u0027ve got a life to get back to.\"\n \"Planes leave all the time.\" Lucia shrugged. \"I\u0027m not going if it means you end up lying unprotected in a hospital bed and the cops aren\u0027t going to put out any effort to find out who shot you. And shot at me, by the way. I take that kind of thing personally.\"\n The look in her eyes was usually accompanied by shooting back, Jazz figured. Or, at the very least, grievous bodily harm.\n \"So you\u0027re sticking around,\" Jazz said. A tight knot in the area of her chest eased a little.\n \"For a while. Until you get back on your feet, anyway. Also, I\u0027m going to wake up some sources and see what they can find out for me. I don\u0027t like the way any of this is playing out.\"\n She started to get up. Jazz stopped her with an outstretched hand. \"Wait. Listen, you need to be careful, all right? You\u0027re not from around here. If you disappear...\"\n Lucia gave her an uncomplicated smile. \"If I disappear, chica, your cop friends are going to have a lot more trouble than they ever bargained for, because the kind of people who\u0027ll come looking for me won\u0027t take a shrug for an answer. And they don\u0027t ask nicely.\" She stood up, gazing down at her. \"Also...I\u0027m not that easy to make vanish.\"\n \"I get that.\" Jazz found herself smiling back. \"Hey. Thank you.\"\n \"That\u0027s what partners are for,\" Lucia said, and reached down to retrieve her sleek black oversize purse. She pulled out a large flat envelope and placed it gently on Jazz\u0027s stomach. There was a pen clipped to it. \"I signed,\" she said. \"It\u0027s up to you whether or not you want to.\"\n Jazz stared at the envelope, frowning. \"Why\u0027d you change your mind?\"\n \"Because I don\u0027t think it matters anymore whether I sign it or not. We\u0027re in this together. Whoever these guys are, they\u0027re not going to back off because we go our separate ways, and I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027d like to have somebody I trust at my back.\" Lucia\u0027s dark eyes were level and clear. \"And if somebody\u0027s going to shoot at me, I\u0027d rather get paid for it.\"\n Jazz laughed. It hurt. She caught her breath, slid the paperwork out and thumbed through it to the last page.\n Lucia\u0027s signature was flowing and bold over her typed name. Jazz set pen to paper, hesitated a second, and then scratched out her own messy, jerky autograph.\n The check was attached to the partnership agreement with a clip. Jazz took it off, turned it over and endorsed it, then handed it all back to Lucia. \"Maybe you\u0027d better handle the bank stuff,\" she said.\n \"Yeah,\" Lucia agreed quietly. \"I will.\"\n In the silence after she was gone, Jazz went over all the ways that she\u0027d just totally screwed up her life. There were dozens. Hundreds. Disaster stretched out in the distance, as certain as the Titanic and the iceberg.\n What if it works? That was the scariest thought of all, strangely. What if it works out, and I don\u0027t need to be a cop anymore? Because that was secretly what she\u0027d always thought would happen. McCarthy would be vindicated. They\u0027re return in triumph, conquering heroes. Life would pick up where it left off.\n What if nothing\u0027s the same?\n That filled her with a kind of fear that had nothing to do with bullet wounds and drive-by shooters and people attacking her in bathrooms. Those things she could deal with. External threats.\n But this...this was different. She\u0027d just done something that would change her future.\n She fell asleep still thinking about that, and reaching no conclusions as to whether or not it was a good thing. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-bargain-red-letter-days-1/page-4.html","bookId":2310,"book":{"id":2310,"title":"Devil\u0027s Bargain (Red Letter Days #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Devil\u0027s Bargain (Red Letter Days #1) \n Jasmine \"Jazz\" Callender is on the downhill slide to ruin.
