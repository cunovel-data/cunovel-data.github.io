Once a decorated homicide detective, she\u0027s lost it all: her former partner\u0027s been convicted of murder, she\u0027s been cashiered out, and she\u0027s drinking away what little self-respect she\u0027s got left. But Jazz has a talent for trouble, and somebody knows it. When a mysterious, sexy stranger comes looking for her with a fateful red envelope in his hand, she\u0027s about to make the deal of her life...for good or bad. \n The deal requires her to enter into a partnership with a stranger and investigate cases that arrive in special red envelopes...which is odd enough, but gets weirder as she and her new partner Lucia realize that they may be working for someone with supernatural abilities. \n And maybe they\u0027re not on the side of the angels anymore.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/devil-s-bargain-red-letter-days-1.jpg","author":"Rachel Caine","type":"Thriller","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":10,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Thriller","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
