{"id":8090,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"I found Tyeglev sitting on the bench. A candle was burning on the table before him and he was writing something in a little album which he always had with him. Seeing me, he quickly put the album in his pocket and began filling his pipe. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Look here, my friend,” I began, “what a trophy I have brought back from my expedition!” I showed him the comb and told him what had happened to me near the willow. “I must have startled a thief,” I added. “You heard a horse was stolen from our neighbour yesterday?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Tyeglev smiled frigidly and lighted his pipe. I sat down beside him. \\n\\n \\n\\n “And do you still believe, Ilya Stepanitch,” I said, “that the voice we heard came from those unknown realms. . . . ” \\n\\n \\n\\n He stopped me with a peremptory gesture. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Ridel,” he began, “I am in no mood for jesting, and so I beg you not to jest.” \\n\\n \\n\\n He certainly was in no mood for jesting. His face was changed. It looked paler, longer and more expressive. His strange, “different” eyes kept shifting from one object to another. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I never thought,” he began again, “that I should reveal to another . . . another man what you are about to hear and what ought to have died . . . yes, died, hidden in my breast; but it seems it is to be — and indeed I have no choice. It is destiny! Listen.” \\n\\n \\n\\n And he told me a long story. \\n\\n \\n\\n I have mentioned already that he was a poor hand at telling stories, but it was not only his lack of skill in describing events that had happened to him that impressed me that night; the very sound of his voice, his glances, the movements which he made with his fingers and his hands — everything about him, indeed, seemed unnatural, unnecessary, false, in fact. I was very young and inexperienced in those days and did not know that the habit of high-flown language and falsity of intonation and manner may become so ingrained in a man that he is incapable of shaking it off: it is a sort of curse. Later in life I came across a lady who described to me the effect on her of her son’s death, of her “boundless” grief, of her fears for her reason, in such exaggerated language, with such theatrical gestures, such melodramatic movements of her head and rolling of her eyes, that I thought to myself, “How false and affected that lady is! She did not love her son at all!” And a week afterwards I heard that the poor woman had really gone out of her mind. Since then I have become much more careful in my judgments and have had far less confidence in my own impressions. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/972/29356.html","bookId":267,"book":{"id":267,"title":"Knock, knock, knock","description":"简介： Referred to by Henry James as \u0027the first novelist of his time\u0027 Ivan Turgenev\u0027s works focus on class, love and suffering.
