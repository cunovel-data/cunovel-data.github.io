The lanterns were of no help to us; they did not in the least dissipate the white, almost luminous mist which surrounded us. Several times Semyon and I lost each other, in spite of the fact that we kept calling to each other and hallooing and at frequent intervals shouted — I: “Tyeglev! Ilya Stepanitch!” and Semyon: “Mr. Tyeglev! Your honour!” The fog so bewildered us that we wandered about as though in a dream; soon we were both hoarse; the fog penetrated right into one’s chest. We succeeded somehow by help of the candles in the windows in reaching the hut again. Our combined action had been of no use — we merely handicapped each other — and so we made up our minds not to trouble ourselves about getting separated but to go each our own way. He went to the left, I to the right and I soon ceased to hear his voice. The fog seemed to have found its way into my brain and I wandered like one dazed, simply shouting from time to time, “Tyeglev! Tyeglev!” \n \n “Here!” I heard suddenly in answer. \n \n Holy saints, how relieved I was! How I rushed in the direction from which the voice came. . . . A human figure loomed dark before me. . . . I made for it. At last! \n \n But instead of Tyeglev I saw another officer of the same battery, whose name was Tyelepnev. \n \n “Was it you answered me?” I asked him. \n \n “Was it you calling me?” he asked in his turn. \n \n “No; I was calling Tyeglev.” \n \n “Tyeglev? Why, I met him a minute ago. What a fool of a night! One can’t find the way home.” \n \n “You saw Tyeglev? Which way did he go?” \n \n “That way, I fancy,” said the officer, waving his hand in the air. “But one can’t be sure of anything now. Do you know, for instance, where the village is? The only hope is the dogs barking. It is a fool of a night! Let me light a cigarette . . . it will seem like a light on the way.” \n \n The officer was, so I fancied, a little exhilarated. \n \n “Did Tyeglev say anything to you?” I asked. \n \n “To be sure he did! I said to him, ‘good evening, brother,’ and he said, ‘good-bye.’ ‘How good-bye? Why good-bye.’ ‘I mean to shoot myself directly with a pistol.’ He is a queer fish!” \n \n My heart stood still. “You say he told you . . . ” \n \n “He is a queer fish!” repeated the officer, and sauntered off. \n \n I hardly had time to recover from what the officer had told me, when my own name, shouted several times as it seemed with effort, caught my ear. I recognised Semyon’s voice. \n \n I called back . . . he came to me. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/972/29362.html","bookId":267,"book":{"id":267,"title":"Knock, knock, knock","description":"简介： Referred to by Henry James as \u0027the first novelist of his time\u0027 Ivan Turgenev\u0027s works focus on class, love and suffering.
