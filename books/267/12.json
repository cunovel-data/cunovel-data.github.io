{"id":8093,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"I spent a very dull and wearisome day. Tyeglev did not return to dinner nor to supper; I did not expect my brother. Towards evening a thick fog came on again, thicker even than the day before. I went to bed rather early. I was awakened by a knocking under the window. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was my turn to be startled! \\n\\n \\n\\n The knock was repeated and so insistently distinct that one could have no doubt of its reality. I got up, opened the window and saw Tyeglev. Wrapped in his great-coat, with his cap pulled over his eyes, he stood motionless. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Ilya Stepanitch!” I cried, “is that you? I gave up expecting you. Come in. Is the door locked?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Tyeglev shook his head. “I do not intend to come in,” he pronounced in a hollow tone. “I only want to ask you to give this letter to the commanding officer tomorrow.” \\n\\n \\n\\n He gave me a big envelope sealed with five seals. I was astonished — however, I took the envelope mechanically. Tyeglev at once walked away into the middle of the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Stop! stop!” I began. “Where are you going? Have you only just come? And what is the letter?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Do you promise to deliver it?” said Tyeglev, and moved away a few steps further. The fog blurred the outlines of his figure. “Do you promise?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I promise . . . but first —” \\n\\n \\n\\n Tyeglev moved still further away and became a long dark blur. “Good-bye,” I heard his voice. “Farewell, Ridel, don’t remember evil against me. . . . And don’t forget Semyon. . . . ” \\n\\n \\n\\n And the blur itself vanished. \\n\\n \\n\\n This was too much. “Oh, the damned poseur,” I thought. “You must always be straining after effect!” I felt uneasy, however; an involuntary fear clutched at my heart. I flung on my great-coat and ran out into the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/972/29359.html","bookId":267,"book":{"id":267,"title":"Knock, knock, knock","description":"简介： Referred to by Henry James as \u0027the first novelist of his time\u0027 Ivan Turgenev\u0027s works focus on class, love and suffering.
