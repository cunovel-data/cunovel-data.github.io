But cuts as deep as the one in his forearm didn\u0027t heal in a matter of minutes.\n She clasped her hands in her lap, willing them to stop trembling. \"What?\" she asked in a voice that sounded nothing like her own. \"What are you?\"\n Chapter 17\n \"I\u0027m a vampire hunter.\"\n Bobbie Sue stared at Tom Duncan, then rolled her eyes. \"If you don\u0027t want to tell me what you do for a living, that\u0027s fine,\" she said coolly. \"You don\u0027t have to make up some outrageous lie.\"\n \"It\u0027s not a lie,\" Duncan said.\n \"But there\u0027s no such thing as vampires,\" Bobbie Sue said. \"Everyone knows that.\"\n \"Are you sure?\"\n \"Of course. They\u0027re just make believe, like Frankenstein\u0027s monster and werewolves and aliens from outer space.\"\n Duncan lifted his wineglass and took a long drink, wondering if he had just ruined his chances of seeing Bobbie Sue again. They were sitting at a cozy table in a dark corner of the Wayside Grill, getting to know each other over dinner. Bobbie Sue had told him about her life. She was twenty-two, the youngest of three children. She had been born and raised in Pear Blossom Creek. After graduation, she had moved to Nashville, where she had fallen in love with a Marine. When he was killed in a plane crash, she had returned home. She worked at Ozzie\u0027s Diner at night and went to beauty school during the day.\n She stared at him over the rim of her glass. \"Aren\u0027t they? Just make believe?\"\n \"I wish they were.\"\n Her eyes widened. \"Is that why you\u0027re here? You\u0027re looking for a vampire?\"\n He nodded.\n \"I don\u0027t believe you.\"\n Putting his glass aside, he leaned across the table. \"I\u0027m telling you the truth.\"\n \"No. No, there\u0027s no such thing.\"\n He reached for her hand when he saw the panic rising in her eyes. If she couldn\u0027t handle the truth, he would only tell her a part of it, for now.\n \"Bobbie Sue, listen, I\u0027m after the man who killed those women and drained them of blood. He thinks he\u0027s a vampire.\" His hand tightened on hers. \"You\u0027re not in any danger.\n He only kills women with red hair— \"\n Her eyes widened in alarm. \"Vicki has red hair.\"\n \"I\u0027ve warned her to be on the lookout for a man with yellow eyes— \"\n \"Yellow eyes! She saw him. At the Blue Horse!\"\n \"I know. She told me.\" He regarded her thoughtfully. \"Are you all right? You\u0027re not gonna run screaming into the night, are you?\"\n \"No, silly.\"\n \"Do you still feel like a movie?\"\n \"Are you sure Vicki\u0027s all right? Shouldn\u0027t you be watching her house or something?\"\n \"I\u0027ve been keeping an eye on her.\"\n \"But not tonight.\" She glanced out the window at the rain. If there really were vampires, this looked like the kind of night when they would be out. \"I think we should go and check on her.\"\n \"All right.\"\n Duncan finished his wine and paid the check. Hand in hand, they dashed across the parking lot to his car. He unlocked the door and helped her in, slid behind the wheel, and thrust the key into the ignition.\n Bobbie Sue\u0027s nervousness transmitted itself to him and he gunned the engine. He had no business being out on a date when Dimitri Falco was on the loose and there were three redheaded women in town, anyone of whom could be Falco\u0027s next victim. Still, they all seemed like smart women. He had warned them there was a serial killer on the loose, admonished them to keep their doors and windows locked, not to go out alone after dark, not to invite any strangers, however charming they might be, into their homes. There hadn\u0027t been any killings in the last few days and Tom couldn\u0027t help hoping that the bastard had left town.\n They drove straight to the diner. Duncan found a parking place by the front door and hurried into the diner with Bobbie Sue on his heels.\n \"She\u0027s not here!\" Bobbie Sue exclaimed.\n Duncan grunted softly. \"Maybe she called in sick.\"\n \"I\u0027ll ask Gus.\"\n When questioned, Gus shook his head. \"I haven\u0027t heard from her. I called a few minutes ago, but she didn\u0027t answer the phone. I was about to call Ned and ask him and Arnie to go out to her place and look around.\"\n \"My date and I will go,\" Bobbie Sue said.\n \"Call me when you get there and let me know what\u0027s going on. It isn\u0027t like her not to call if she isn\u0027t coming in.\"\n With a nod, Bobbie Sue left the kitchen and went back into the diner.\n \"What did you find out?\" Duncan asked.\n \"She didn\u0027t call. I told Gus we\u0027d go check on her.\"\n \"Let\u0027s do it.\"\n \"She must be home,\" Bobbie Sue said when they pulled into Vicki\u0027s driveway a few minutes later. \"Her car\u0027s here and the lights are on.\"\n Duncan parked his car beside Vicki\u0027s and turned off the ignition and the lights. Rounding the car, he opened Bobbie Sue\u0027s door, and they ran up the stairs to the porch.\n Duncan rang the doorbell once, twice.\n He saw Vicki peering through the window beside the door, then the door swung open and she was standing there.\n \"Hey,\" he said. \"Are you all right?\"\n \"Yes, why?\"\n \"Gus was worried about you,\" Bobbie Sue said. \"You didn\u0027t call in.\"\n \"Oh. I guess I forgot.\"\n Bobbie Sue tilted her head to one side. \"You forgot?\"\n Vicki glanced over her shoulder, then looked back at Bobbie Sue. \"I\u0027ll call Gus. Is there anything else?\"\n \"Vicki, is something wrong?\"\n \"Wrong? No, of course not. Why do you ask?\"\n \"You\u0027re just acting kind of, you know, weird.\"\n \"Is there anything we can do?\" Duncan asked.\n \"I don\u0027t think so. I— \"\n \"I need to use the restroom,\" Bobbie Sue said, and before Vicki could stop her, she swept into the house. \"Oh,\" she said, \"I didn\u0027t know you had company.\"\n Duncan looked at Vicki, wondering if he and Bobbie Sue had interrupted something best left uninterrupted. \"Who\u0027s here?\"\n \"Antonio stopped by,\" Vicki replied, her voice tight.\n \"And he\u0027s bleeding,\" Bobbie Sue said, her voice shrill. \"What happened?\"\n Duncan moved past Vicki, admonishing her to close and lock the door. Going into the living room, he stood in front of the sofa, his gaze narrowing as he took in Battista\u0027s appearance.\n Duncan swore under his breath, his hand reaching up to curl around the heavy gold cross at his throat.\n \"I should have known,\" he said, his voice hard. \"You\u0027re one of them.\"\n \"One of what?\" Bobbie Sue asked.\n \"He\u0027s a dirty, no-good, blood-sucking vampire.\"\n Bobbie Sue looked at Duncan and shook her head. \"You said there was no such thing.\"\n \"I lied.\"\n \"So he\u0027s really a… a… \" She uttered a wordless cry, then her eyes rolled back in her head and she fainted.\n Duncan caught her before she hit the floor, but his eyes remained locked on Antonio\u0027s.\n \"I knew you looked familiar.\"\n Antonio lifted one brow but said nothing.\n Duncan \u0027s eyes narrowed. \"It is you, isn\u0027t it?\"\n Vicki stared at Antonio in stunned disbelief. \"Tell me it isn\u0027t true.\"\n \"I was going to tell you,\" he said, rising. \"It is one of the reasons I came here tonight.\"\n She covered her mouth with her fingertips, remembering the passionate kisses they had shared, horrified beyond words to think that she had kissed a man who wasn\u0027t even a man. A man who wasn\u0027t even alive, who drank blood to survive! Feeling suddenly light-headed, she thought that she, too, might faint. She sank down on the sofa, too stunned to speak, too numb to think.\n Duncan stared at Battista over Bobbie Sue\u0027s inert form, then swore a vile oath. Here he was, in the same room with a vampire, and all his gear was outside in the trunk of his car. Of course, even if it were close at hand he couldn\u0027t reach it, not with his arms full of soft feminine flesh.\n Battista looked at Victoria. \"Forgive me,\" he murmured, and then, to her astonishment, he vanished from her sight.\n Muttering a curse, Duncan sat down on one of the chairs and cradled Bobbie Sue to his chest. \"Dammit, I should have recognized him sooner.\"\n Vicki crossed her arms over her breasts. This couldn\u0027t be real. She had to be dreaming again. \"Where did you meet Antonio?\"\n \"We didn\u0027t \u0027meet,\u0027 exactly. I was on my way back to my hotel one night, minding my own business, when I decided to take a shortcut through a vacant lot. He was there, bent over some poor kid. I pulled my.38 from my coat pocket and held it down at my side. I don\u0027t know why. I knew the gun wouldn\u0027t save me if he decided to attack. Something passed between us that night. I\u0027m not sure what it was. I stood there, watching, while he finished drinking that kid\u0027s blood. When he was through, he whispered something to the boy and the boy walked away, looking none the worse for wear. Battista stared at me for what seemed like an eternity. I\u0027ve no doubt he could have killed me that night.\n Instead, he bowed in my direction and then he vanished.\"\n When he finished speaking, the silence in the room was complete save for the sound of the raindrops dripping from the eaves.\n Vicki stared at the spot where Battista had stood only moments before. Duncan had told her that vampires were real, and she had believed him. She had read about the bodies being drained of blood. She had seen the creature with the yellow eyes. And still, in some deep corner of her mind, she had not truly believed such creatures existed.\n She knew now why she had never seen Antonio during the day.\n She knew now why she had never seen him eat or drink anything. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-20.html","bookId":2298,"book":{"id":2298,"title":"Desire After Dark (Vampire Trilogy #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Desire After Dark (Vampire Trilogy #3) \n Vicki Cavendish knows she should be careful.
