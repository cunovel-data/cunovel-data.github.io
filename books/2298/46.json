Christmas came and Vicki went to visit her mother and her sister for a few days, but she was glad to get back home, glad to get back to work.\n She accepted a date with Arnie for New Year\u0027s Eve and they went to a party at Bobbie Sue\u0027s house. She tried to have a good time. She danced with Arnie and laughed at his jokes; she even let him take her outside, where they stood in the shadows and necked like a couple of teenagers, but her heart wasn\u0027t in it. His kisses, while pleasant, didn\u0027t make her heart pound or send her blood racing.\n With a sigh, he let her go. \"I keep hoping I can light some sparks between us,\" he said glumly. \"But I guess the fire\u0027s just on my side.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Arnie, really I am, but… \"\n \"It\u0027s that guy, isn\u0027t it? That stranger that was hanging around for a while?\"\n She nodded, afraid to mention Antonio\u0027s name for fear she would burst into tears.\n \"Well, you can\u0027t blame a guy for tryin\u0027 one more time,\" Arnie said with a wistful smile.\n \"But if you\u0027ve got it bad for the guy, why didn\u0027t you let him know?\"\n \"I did, but we had a few problems we couldn\u0027t work out.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Vicki. If there\u0027s anything I can do to help…?\"\n \"Thanks, Arnie.\"\n The blaring of horns and a few distant gunshots announced the arrival of the new year.\n Arnie held out his arms and waited, letting the decision be hers. She hesitated only a moment, then moved into his embrace and let him kiss her. There were no bells, no skyrockets. It was just a friendly kiss. A few minutes later, she pleaded a headache and asked Arnie to take her home.\n After getting ready for bed and making sure all the doors and windows were locked, she sat in front of her bedroom window and stared into the darkness, wondering where Antonio was. Had he spent the evening at the castle with Lady Kathryn? Or had he spent it with another woman? Had he kissed her at midnight and wished her a happy new year?\n She let the tears come then because it was too painful to hold them back any longer.\n Later, lying in bed feeling sorry for herself, she resolved to put Antonio Battista out of her mind once and for all.\n And it worked, too, until she woke up the next morning.\n Trying to forget Antonio was like trying to give up chocolate. No matter how good her intentions were, sooner or later she had to give in. The longest she had ever gone without chocolate was a day and a half. The longest she managed to go without thinking of Antonio was an hour and a half, while she took a nap. And then, even though she wasn\u0027t consciously thinking of him, he was there, in her dreams, his dark eyes filled with a yearning that matched her own. In her dreams, she could be with him. Never before had she had dreams that were so realistic. She could taste him and touch him, hear his voice, inhale his heady masculine scent. He beckoned to her and she obeyed, surrendering her body to his touch, fulfilling his every desire as he fulfilled hers. She went to bed earlier each night, eager to be in the arms of her phantom lover, to hear his voice whispering that he loved her.\n It was pathetic, she thought as she went to bed that night, that her dreams were happier and more fulfilling than her current reality. But if she couldn\u0027t have Antonio in the flesh, she would settle for whatever she could get.\n Antonio lay on his back in the bed she had slept in, her pillow beneath his head. Her scent filled his nostrils; her image was constantly in his mind. Try as he might, there was no escaping her.\n Soon after he had returned to the castle, he had gone in search of female companionship. The girl, Steffie, had been about Victoria \u0027s age, but that was where the similarity ended. Steffie had lived a hard life. The knowledge was there, in her eyes, in the harsh lines around her eyes and mouth, in her cynical expression when she told him what it would cost him to have her spend the night.\n He had taken her to an expensive hotel, fully intending to bed her and hopefully ease his ache for Victoria. But nothing had happened. He had looked at her and felt nothing but disgust, not for her, but for himself. He had slipped her an extra fifty, told her to stay and enjoy the room, and left her there.\n Now, he closed his eyes, courting sleep. He was a vampire, a creature who was alive only during the hours of darkness, yet these nights he sought sleep at the time when he was usually the most active. Sleep. He stalked it relentlessly, needing it as he needed blood to survive. In sleep, he could walk in her dreams. He could hold her and love her as he so longed to do. In her dreams, she did not resist him. In dreams, she was his, only his, eager for his touch, for his kisses. In sleep, her inhibitions were few and easily overcome. It was wrong, and he knew it, but he could no more resist invading her dreams than he could resist the need to quench his unholy thirst. He had let her go.\n Surely, he deserved some kind of reward for such an unselfish act. If he could not have her in the flesh, he would settle for whatever he could get.\n February came, and with it, a flurry of activity. There was a wedding shower for Bobbie Sue and wedding rehearsals and suddenly it was Valentine\u0027s Day. Vicki had been surprised to learn that Bobbie Sue and Duncan had decided to be married at night so Ramsey and his wife could attend. But maybe it wasn\u0027t so surprising at that. After all, Duncan and Ramsey had been best friends for years before Ramsey was turned.\n Vicki cried as she watched Bobbie Sue and Tom kiss after they had exchanged their vows. She wept because she was truly happy for her best friend. She wept because she was green with envy for the happiness she saw in Bobbie Sue\u0027s eyes. She wept because she missed Antonio. Her heart ached for him, constantly yearning for something she could never have. She knew he had left her because he thought it was the right thing to do, because he didn\u0027t want to deprive her of the chance to live a normal life, have children and grandchildren. But what good was a normal life if she couldn\u0027t share it with the man she loved?\n After the wedding, she met Edward Ramsey\u0027s wife. Kelly Ramsey was lovely. Tall and slender, she had long, wavy black hair and brown eyes. Vicki also met Grigori Chiavari and his wife, Marisa. She wondered what the other guests would think if they knew there were vampires in their midst.\n Later, standing quietly beside Bobbie Sue while Duncan and his vampire friends reminisced, Vicki studied the vampires. If she hadn\u0027t known differently, she would never have guessed that Duncan \u0027s friends were vampires and yet… Vicki studied Edward and Kelly and Grigori and Marisa. There was something about them, something elusive that they shared with Antonio. After a time, she realized it was the allure of the vampire, that innate charisma that allowed the Undead to seduce their prey so easily.\n Grigori Chiavari reminded her a great deal of Antonio. They were both handsome and charming, with smiles that few women could resist. They had the same rugged athletic build, the same long black hair, though Antonio\u0027s eyes were dark blue and Grigori\u0027s were black.\n Marisa Chiavari was petite, with shoulder-length dark brown hair and green eyes. She and Grigori looked good together, she small and feminine, he the epitome of male perfection. Grigori never missed a chance to touch his wife. It was obvious that he adored her, as she adored him.\n Jealousy streaked through Vicki when she saw the way Grigori and Marisa looked at each other.\n Only when like marries like. The words repeated themselves in Vicki\u0027s mind as the night wore on.\n Grigori had brought Marisa across.\n Ramsey had brought Kelly across.\n Vicki frowned. Why couldn\u0027t Antonio bring her across? Deep inside, hadn\u0027t she always known that was the only answer? Why hadn\u0027t Antonio suggested it? Why hadn\u0027t she?\n Because, like it or not, a small part of her was repulsed by the mere idea of becoming what he was.\n It was a truth she didn\u0027t want to acknowledge, but the truth nevertheless.\n She studied the vampire couples during the rest of the evening, wondering if it would be rude to take Kelly and Marisa aside and ask them the hundreds of questions running through her mind. Did they miss being mortal? Were they ever sorry they had accepted the Dark Gift? Would they do it again? Did they ever miss the daylight world? Did they miss eating and drinking, walks in the park, bright summer days, watching the beauty of a sunset, the promise of a sunrise? Did they regret giving up the chance to have children? If given the chance, would they return to mortality?\n On the outside, Kelly and Marisa seemed perfectly happy with their vampire state and hopelessly in love with their husbands.\n Vicki blew out a sigh. Did she love Antonio enough to take the step Marisa and Kelly had taken to be with the men they loved?\n It was a thought that preyed on Vicki\u0027s mind long after the reception was over.\n Did she want to be a vampire? Did she want to give up the sun and drink blood to survive? Did she want to give up all hope of having a family?\n Did she want to spend the rest of her life without Antonio?\n No!\n Day after day, she weighed the pros and cons. And every night when she lay in bed, alone and lonely, she asked herself if she was making the right decision, a decision that, once made, could not be unmade. It wasn\u0027t like a bad haircut that would eventually grow out. It wasn\u0027t like picking out the wrong shade of lipstick or the wrong pair of shoes. This was a life-altering event. If she wasn\u0027t happy with the fit, she couldn\u0027t take it back.\n In the eight days it took her to make up her mind, Vicki bought a disposable camera and had Bobbie Sue take her picture from every possible angle so that she wouldn\u0027t forget what she looked like when looking in a mirror was no longer possible. She had her eyebrows tattooed so that she would never have to mess with applying eyebrow pencil again. She indulged her passion for chocolate. She had always tanned quickly and she spent hours sunbathing in the nude until she was a nice golden shade of brown, all over. She got up early to watch the sun rise. She stopped in at the Curl and Dye for a trim and got a manicure and a pedicure while she was at it. She went to lunch with Bobbie Sue a couple of times, called her mother and her sister and told them she was going on a long vacation and not to worry if they didn\u0027t hear from her for a while.\n She spent time with Mrs. Heath. The woman was amazing, Vicki thought. Now that she was no longer afraid to leave the house after dark, Mrs. Heath had become quite a gadabout. She played bingo at the church on Monday night, went to the monthly midnight sidewalk sales and the late movie, and sat out in her garden in the evening. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-46.html","bookId":2298,"book":{"id":2298,"title":"Desire After Dark (Vampire Trilogy #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Desire After Dark (Vampire Trilogy #3) \n Vicki Cavendish knows she should be careful.
