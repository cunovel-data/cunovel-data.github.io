{"id":93601,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"Ah, Victoria,\" he murmured, his voice ragged. \"I knew you would be sweet, but… \" He shook his head as if to clear it and then took a deep breath. \"I think perhaps I should go.\" She was still too astonished by what she thought she had seen in his eyes to argue. He gazed down at her a moment more, then turned and left the room. Only after he was gone did she realize his footsteps had made no sound on the tile floor. Vicki woke in the morning after a restless night. Her dreams had been filled with mysterious visions of figures swathed in black cloaks moving through dark shadows, of wolves howling beneath a bloodred moon, of a hooded man, his fangs glistening as he bent over her throat, of a blue-eyed cat and a yellow-eyed cat engaged in a brutal, bloody fight to the death. She tried to shake off the disturbing images while she showered but to no avail, until she thought of Antonio\u0027s kiss the night before. That memory drove everything else from her mind. Where on earth had the man learned to kiss like that? It was like no kiss she had ever known before, dark and wild and filled with a deep hunger that had frightened and aroused her at the same time. Just thinking about it now sent a rush of heat through her, made her yearn to be in his arms again, to feel his mouth moving over hers… Jerking her thoughts away from where they were headed, she turned off the water and stepped out of the shower. It was Friday and she had things to do before she went to work. She dressed quickly in a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. Going into the kitchen, she whipped up some French toast and ate it while she read the morning paper, relieved to see that there had been no killings the night before, at least not in this part of the county. After breakfast, she brushed her teeth, then slipped on a pair of sandals, grabbed her handbag and her keys, and drove into town. She had always loved Pear Blossom Creek, with its wide, tree-lined streets. She loved it that she knew just about everyone in town. She waved at Ned, who was coming out of 31 Flavors with his sons. Vicki smiled, looking forward to the day when she would have kids of her own. Of course, she needed to find a husband first. Maybe she needed to put an ad in the paper. She laughed at that as she imagined what people would say. She picked up her cleaning, filled the car with gas, returned her books to the library, and then stopped to chat with old Mrs. Heath, who was outside watering her garden. Ramona Heath was ninety if she was a day and as spry as a teenager. She lived alone in a small red brick house on the corner of Fifth andMain. Gardening was her hobby and her passion and her gardens were the talk not only of Pear Blossom Creek but also of all the surrounding counties. Aside from a veritable jungle of flowers, Mrs. Heath grew the largest squash and pumpkins in the county. She also grew enough garlic to stock every store in the state. She had the plants growing under all her windows and in pots on either side of the front and back doors of the house. Mrs. Heath also claimed to have the power of sight. Vicki didn\u0027t believe in such things, yet Mrs. Heath had predicted far too many events that had come to pass far too often for her predictions to be mere coincidence. Mrs. Heath also believed in ghosts and spirits and claimed to have spoken to her deceased husband during a séance. Her other quirk was that she never went outside alone after sundown. Ever. Mrs. Heath turned off the hose and invited Vicki inside. As always, Vicki was amazed by the amount of clutter in the older woman\u0027s house. There were magazines and newspapers everywhere. Vicki thought Mrs. Heath must be the most well-informed woman in Pear Blossom Creek. She subscribed to newspapers from just about every major city this side of the Missouri. In addition to the papers, there were plants and knick-knacks and books on every available surface. A large crucifix hung over the fireplace. Vicki followed Ramona into the kitchen and sat down at the table. \"Did you see the moon last night?\" Mrs. Heath asked as she poured Vicki a glass of lemonade. \"It was red.\" \"Red?\" Mrs. Heath nodded as she cleared a chair of a pile of newspapers and sat down. \"As blood. And I heard a wolf howl.\" Vicki shivered. \"A wolf? Are you sure?\" Mrs. Heath nodded again. Vicki knew there were wolves out in the country near Hellfire Hollow, but she had never heard of one coming into town. \"It was probably just a dog howling.\" \"No, dear. It was a wolf. I\u0027m going to call Neddie later and let him know.\" Vicki grinned. Mrs. Heath was the only one who could call Ned Williams by his childhood nickname and get away with it. \"So, dear,\" Mrs. Heath said, \"have you found yourself a young man yet?\" \"Not yet, but I\u0027m still looking.\" It had long been Vicki\u0027s dream to marry and settle down. She wanted to have the same sort of happy marriage that her parents had enjoyed, to raise some kids, to live out her life with a man who would love her as long as they lived. \"You should give Arnie another chance,\" Mrs. Heath said, patting her hand. \"He\u0027s a fine young man.\" Vicki rolled her eyes. Was everyone in town determined to see her married to Arnie Hall? \"You\u0027ll never find a better man.\" \"Maybe not,\" Vicki said, thinking of Antonio. \"Then again, I might.\" \"Why, Victoria Lynn,\" Mrs. Heath said, her eyes twinkling, \"have you found a beau you\u0027re not telling anyone about?\" \"Now, Mrs. Heath, you know if that were true, you\u0027d be the first one to know.\" Mrs. Heath beamed at her. \"You\u0027re such a sweet girl. You should have a family and a man to take care of you.\" Sharlene had deserved to have a family, too, Vicki thought with a sigh. She had seen Ron at the gas station earlier. He had forced a smile when he waved at her. When she went to pay for her gas, Fred Black had told her that Ron had quit his job and was moving to Amarillo. She couldn\u0027t blame him. There were too many bad memories for him here. She seemed to recall that he had some family in Texas. \"Can I get your some more lemonade, dear?\" \"No, thank you.\" They chatted for a few more minutes and then Vicki gave Mrs. Heath a quick hug and took her leave. Vicki spent the rest of the day dusting and vacuuming and doing her laundry, her mind filled with thoughts of the bounty hunter and Antonio and unblinking yellow eyes. She was glad when it was finally time to get ready for work. Hopefully, the diner would have a crowd tonight and she would be too busy to think of grieving parents or howling wolves or dynamite kisses. The bounty hunter was having dinner when she arrived. Steak again, she noted in passing. He was a real meat-and-potatoes kind of guy, she thought with a grin. Not bad looking, either. She wondered how long he was going to be in town and who the mysterious man with the yellow eyes was and if the hunter was any closer to finding him. It was still hard to believe that there was a killer on the loose in their sleepy little town. She approached Tom Duncan\u0027s table when he pushed his plate away. \"Can I get you anything else?\" He looked up, seeming surprised to see her. \"Hi. What happened to Gladys?\" \"Her shift ends at six. Can I get you some dessert?\" \"I don\u0027t know. You got any apple pie?\" \"Best in town.\" \"How about bringing me a big slice and a cup of coffee?\" \"Sure. You want ice cream with that?\" \"Why not? You only live once, right? Might as well enjoy the good things while you can.\" Vicki thought about how true that was as she cut him an extra-large slice of pie and added a double scoop of ice cream. Picking up the coffeepot and the plate, she carried both back to table number four. He murmured his thanks as she placed the plate in front of him, then refilled his coffee cup. He took a bite of pie and smiled his approval. \"You\u0027re right, it is good.\" With a nod, she moved away from the table. Tom Duncan glanced around the diner, noting that he was the only one eating alone. Everywhere he looked there were couples on dates or families enjoying a night out together. Even Ramsey had found a mate. Well, he was tired of being alone, he thought irritably. Even vampire hunters deserved a night off. His gaze settled on Vicki as she cleared a nearby table. She was a pretty thing. He\u0027d checked earlier, noting that she didn\u0027t wear any rings. While waiting for her to bring him his bill, he looked around the diner again. It looked like something out of the fifties, with its black and white tile floor. There was a long counter lined with stools covered in red vinyl. There was a jukebox in one corner that played all the old fifties hits. He\u0027d noted that Elvis was a big favorite. There were old movie posters on the walls. Again, Elvis was prominently featured. There were booths along two of the walls; round tables covered with red-checked cloths stood in the center of the floor. When she returned to see if there was anything else he wanted, Duncan took his courage in hand and blurted, \"I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any chance you\u0027d like to go out with me one of these nights?\" Vicki started to say no, then thought how nice it would be if she could tell Mrs. Heath that she\u0027d had a date. \"I might. What did you have in mind?\" \"Dinner and a movie? Just dinner? Just a movie? I\u0027m easy.\" \"I\u0027m off on Sundays and Mondays.\" She slid his bill under the salt shaker. \"How about Sunday night? I could pick you up about what, five? Six?\" \"Six is good.\" Tearing a page out of her pad, she wrote her address and phone number on the back and handed it to him. He looked at it briefly, then folded the paper in half and put it in his shirt pocket. \"Sunday at six,\" he said with a smile. \"Of course, I\u0027ll probably see you before then.\" With a nod, she went to clear table two. Duncan whistled softly as he left the diner. It was too nice an evening to go back to the hotel. Instead, he took a walk about the town. It wasn\u0027t a big place but it seemed prosperous enough. The people were friendly. They nodded to him or called a greeting as he passed by. It was the kind of place that reminded him of the old days, when most towns and cities were small and people didn\u0027t bother to lock their doors and everybody knew everybody else\u0027s business. A nice town where people expected to die of old age surrounded by friends and family, not dragged into the woods to be dinner for a hungry fiend.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-8.html","bookId":2298,"book":{"id":2298,"title":"Desire After Dark (Vampire Trilogy #3)","description":"Storyline: Desire After Dark (Vampire Trilogy #3) Vicki Cavendish knows she should be careful.
