After all, there\u0027s a killer loose in town—one who drains women of blood, women with red hair and green eyes just like her. She knows she should tell police about the dark, gorgeous man who comes into the diner every night, the one who makes her feel a longing she\u0027s never felt before. The last thing she should do is invite the beautiful stranger into her house. \\n Cursed to an eternity of darkness, Antonio Battista has wandered the earth, satisfying his hunger with countless women, letting none find a place in his heart. But Victoria Cavendish is different. Finally, he has found a woman to love, a woman who accepts him for what he is—a woman who wants him as much as he wants her...which is why he should leave. But Antonio is a vampire, not a saint. What is his, he\u0027ll fight to keep and protect. And Victoria Cavendish needs protecting...from the remorseless enemy who would make her his prey...and from Antonio\u0027s own uncontrollable hunger.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3.jpg","author":"Amanda Ashley","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:34 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:07 PM"}}
