Your way or the highway?\"\n He grinned, amused by her choice of words. \"Something like that.\"\n \"I don\u0027t sleep around,\" she said, \"so I guess you\u0027d better go.\" But even as she said the words, she knew it was the last thing she wanted. In spite of everything, she was attracted to Antonio. No other man had ever appealed to her the way he did, made her feel the way he did.\n \"You misunderstand me,\" he said. \"I am not asking for your virginity. I am only saying that I want to get to know you better, to spend time with you, to stay here, with you, for as long as you will let me. I want your companionship… \" Again, his gaze lingered on her lips. \"And your affection.\"\n \"You said for as long as I\u0027ll let you. What does that mean, exactly?\"\n \"I think you will soon grow weary of me, and when that time comes, I will trouble you no more, though I will not leave this place until Falco is destroyed.\"\n \"What makes you think I\u0027ll get tired of you?\"\n \"Because I am a vampire. Because I cannot be with you during the day. Because I will be possessive and demanding of the time that we can share. And because nothing can come of whatever feelings grow out of our relationship. Do you understand what I am saying?\"\n \"I think you\u0027re warning me not to fall in love with you.\"\n \"Yes. Think carefully about what I have said. I will come for your answer tomorrow night.\"\n \"There\u0027s just one thing,\" she said. \"What if you fall in love with me?\"\n \"I am already in love with you, my sweet one,\" he replied, and for the second time that night, he disappeared from her sight.\n Chapter 18\n Bobbie Sue sat on the sofa, a blanket draped around her shoulders, a cup of hot tea cradled between her hands. \"So, it\u0027s true, all of it? You\u0027re a vampire hunter and Antonio is a vampire?\"\n Duncan nodded.\n \"And Sharlene and those other women, they\u0027ve all been killed by a vampire?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"It\u0027s just one vampire doing the killing, right? I mean, Antonio isn\u0027t… \"\n \"Well, I can\u0027t be sure of that,\" Duncan admitted. And at the same time, he admitted something he had known but refused to acknowledge for years. Between the two of them, Ramsey had been the true hunter. Duncan had been the slayer. Not for the first time, he wondered if it was time to hang up his vampire kit and find another line of work.\n Maybe something here, in Pear Blossom Creek. Maybe it was time to settle down and get married, maybe to a pretty girl like Bobbie Sue, and raise a couple of kids.\n \"Are you going to… you know?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure as hell gonna try.\"\n \"Both of them?\"\n \"That\u0027s the only way to be sure I\u0027ve got the killer,\" Duncan said, and then he laughed softly. All vampires were killers. No matter how civilized and friendly they might seem, killing was in their nature. It was a fact he would be wise to remember. Now, in addition to looking for Falco\u0027s resting place, he would have to search for Battista\u0027s as well.\n Dammit, he wished Ramsey were siding him on this one.\n \"But what about Vicki? I think she really likes Antonio.\"\n He grunted softly. \"Believe me, the world will be better off without him, and so will she.\"\n Bobbie Sue didn\u0027t argue, but she looked unconvinced.\n Duncan sat down on the sofa and put his arm around her. \"You\u0027ll just have to trust me on this.\"\n Chapter 19\n Vicki didn\u0027t get any sleep that night. She sat on the sofa in front of the fireplace thinking about Antonio, reliving every moment she had spent with him as she tried to decide what her answer would be when she saw him again. Had he been an ordinary man, the decision would have been easy, she thought, or would it? Maybe, subconsciously, part of his attraction was the fact that he wasn\u0027t an ordinary man.\n One thing was certain, if he weren\u0027t a vampire, she would most likely be dead by now, and so would he. Only the fact that he was a vampire had enabled him to fight off Falco\u0027s attack. It was a sobering, disturbing thought.\n So, what was she going to do? She thought of all the men she had known and dated.\n They had all been nice guys, but none of them had held her interest for long. There had been no excitement, no sparks, nothing beyond friendship. Their caresses hadn\u0027t excited her or made her long for more than kisses. She had never been tempted to surrender her virtue for a night of wild passion, at least not until Antonio entered her life.\n Since the night she had first seen him, she had thought of little else.\n It wasn\u0027t fair. She had finally found a man who fascinated her, and he wasn\u0027t a man at all. As attracted to him as she was, there seemed little point in pursuing their relationship. He had made it quite clear that there couldn\u0027t be anything serious between them, and he was right. No matter how she felt about him, they were as different as day and night. She laughed bitterly. Day and night, indeed.\n He had said he loved her.\n And she was horribly afraid that she was dangerously close to falling in love with him.\n With a sigh, she hugged one of the sofa pillows to her chest. It was obvious that no matter what decision she made, sooner or later she was going to end up with a broken heart.\n She fell asleep on the sofa, her dreams disjointed and confusing. Sometimes Antonio was chasing her and sometimes she was chasing him and then, without warning, it would be Falco chasing her, his breath hot on the back of her neck. She woke feeling hungry and out of sorts with barely enough time to shower and dress and make it to work on time.\n \"Hey, Red, how are you feelin\u0027?\" Gus asked.\n \"Fine, thanks.\"\n \"I guess it was just a twenty-four-hour thing,\" Gus remarked.\n She frowned and then remembered that she had called in sick the night before. \"I guess so. How\u0027s the crowd tonight?\"\n \"Same as always.\"\n With a smile, she went out into the diner, wondering if Antonio would come in.\n The first hour passed quickly, with the dinner crowd keeping her and Bobbie Sue busy.\n Vicki had the feeling Bobbie Sue wanted to talk to her, but there was no time until the dinner crowd dispersed.\n As soon as the diner cleared, Bobbie Sue took her aside. \"You don\u0027t mind my dating Tom, do you?\"\n \"Mind? Of course not. Why should I mind?\"\n \"Well, you went out with him first and I… Well, I just wanted to make sure I wasn\u0027t stepping on your toes.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it. So tell me, are you going out with him again?\"\n \"I want to, but I don\u0027t know. I mean, what he does for a living kind of creeps me out.\"\n Bobbie Sue lowered her voice. \"Can you believe all this? Vampires in the twenty-first century? I still can\u0027t believe it.\"\n \"I know what you mean. Can you imagine what would happen if the word got out?\n People would either lock us up in the loony bin, or they\u0027d panic and run amok.\"\n Vicki glanced up, her pulse quickening in anticipation as the bell over the door rang, but it was just Rhonda McGee. She looked around and took a seat at one of Vicki\u0027s tables.\n \"So, what do you think I should do?\" Bobbie Sue asked. \"About Tom?\"\n \"What does your heart tell you?\"\n \"To see him again,\" Bobbie Sue said, smiling. \"Thanks.\"\n With a nod, Vicki went to take Rhonda\u0027s order. Not surprisingly, Rhonda brought up the recent murders and the fact that she and Vicki were both redheads.\n \"It\u0027s unsettling,\" Rhonda said. \"I never used to be afraid to go out at night, you know?\n But now… \" She shrugged. \"I\u0027m thinking of asking if I can work the day shift for a while.\"\n \"I don\u0027t blame you,\" Vicki said. \"I\u0027ve been thinking about that, too. You haven\u0027t seen a man with yellow eyes, have you?\"\n \"Yellow eyes? No, I\u0027m sure I\u0027d remember that.\"\n \"Well, if you see him, run like the devil himself was after you.\"\n \"Vicki, you\u0027re scaring me.\"\n \"Good, because he\u0027s the killer.\"\n Rhonda\u0027s eyes widened. \"How do you know? Have you seen him? Oh my gosh, you have! When? Where?\"\n \"At the Blue Horse the other night.\"\n \"Thanks for the warning. I was going over there later.\"\n \"Well, don\u0027t. And don\u0027t invite any strange men into your house.\"\n \"You\u0027re the second one to tell me that.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n Rhonda leaned forward, her voice low and intimate. \"A really good-looking guy walked me home from the hospital one night and warned me about that. I don\u0027t know who he was, but I was really tempted to ask him in, stranger or not… Oh, there he is now.\"\n Feeling as though a million butterflies had just taken flight in her stomach, Vicki glanced over her shoulder. And there he was, dressed all in black, as usual, his hair damp from the rain that had started to fall a short while ago.\n His gaze found hers. The electricity that arced between them could have lit up the whole state.\n As though drawn by an invisible string, Vicki followed him to the booth in the back.\n \"Hi,\" she said, hoping he wouldn\u0027t notice how breathless she sounded.\n \"Good evening, Victoria.\"\n She laughed softly. \"Good evening.\"\n \"You find that amusing?\"\n \"No. Well, yes. Haven\u0027t you ever seen Dracula?\"\n He lifted one brow. \"Excuse me?\"\n \"You know, the movie, Dracula. He also says \u0027good evening.\u0027\"\n \"Ah. I saw you talking to Miss McGee. Is she a friend of yours?\"\n \"In a town this small, everyone is either your friend or a relative. She said you warned her not to open her door for strangers.\"\n He nodded.\n \"She also said she was tempted to ask you in.\"\n Man or vampire, they all had egos. It was blatantly obvious that he was flattered.\n \"Do not let me keep you from your work,\" he said.\n \"All right.\" She cocked her head to one side. \"So is it true that you never eat and that you never drink anything but… you know?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-22.html","bookId":2298,"book":{"id":2298,"title":"Desire After Dark (Vampire Trilogy #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Desire After Dark (Vampire Trilogy #3) \n Vicki Cavendish knows she should be careful.
