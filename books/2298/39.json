She didn\u0027t feel very brave. Her hand tightened around the crucifix as she felt his breath on her neck, the sharp sting of his fangs, the mind-blowing pleasure as he drank from her. It always astonished her, the pure delight, the sense of blissful contentment… Pleasure turned to fear as she felt suddenly dizzy. \"Antonio? Antonio, stop!\" For a moment, she was afraid he was beyond hearing, beyond stopping. She lifted her hand, the cross bared on her palm. \"Antonio, stop, please!\" He was already hurting. She didn\u0027t want to cause him more pain. With a low groan, he drew away. For a moment, she saw him as he truly was, his eyes red, his fangs lowered. And then he was her Antonio again, his eyes dark with concern. \" Victoria?\" \"I\u0027m all right. Are you?\" \"Better now.\" Drawing her closer, he brushed a kiss across her lips. \"I must go out for a while.\" He stroked her cheek, his eyes filled with such tenderness it made her heart ache. \"Do not wait up for me,\" he said, and he was gone. \"Yeah, right,\" she muttered. \"Like I\u0027m gonna get any sleep until you get home.\" She sat there a moment, thinking that she must be getting used to being bitten, since she hadn\u0027t passed out this time. She was, however, famished. But food could wait. She went through the house, turning on all the lights and making sure all the doors and windows were locked. She wished she had some of Mrs. Heath\u0027s garlic to spread around. Suddenly, the old lady\u0027s quirks all made sense. Well, if Mrs. Heath could outsmart Falco and live to be ninety, so could she! In the kitchen, she fixed a huge ham and cheese sandwich and poured a big glass of milk. She added an apple, a banana, and a few cookies to the plate and carried everything upstairs to the back parlor. Sitting in Antonio\u0027s chair, she turned on the TV and flipped through the channels, settling on an old comedy starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day. No dark dramas tonight! No sci-fi movies about aliens. Tonight she needed laughter. But she couldn\u0027t concentrate on the movie. Where was Antonio? Where had he gone to look for prey? How long did it take him to feed? Would he come back to the castle tonight? Did he rest here during the day? And most troubling of all, where was Falco? They had escaped him this time, but what about next time? Would they ever be free of him? Did he take his rest in that old shed? If so, she needed Tom Duncan\u0027s help. She would call Bobbie Sue tomorrow. The end credits were running on the TV when Antonio returned. One minute she was alone in the room and the next he was there, beside her. Sometime between the time he\u0027d left the castle and his return, he had changed into a pair of black jeans and a black T-shirt. The burns at his throat, wrists, and ankles were still visible, still painful looking, though the burn on his cheek was nearly gone. \"Are you feeling better?\" she asked. He nodded. She gestured at the burn mark on his neck. \"Does it still hurt?\" \"Like the very devil.\" \"Well, that\u0027s not surprising, since the devil did it.\" Antonio looked at her, sadness reflected in his eyes. \"We are the same, he and I.\" \"No!\" \"We are both vampires, sweeting. Both killers who prey on others to survive.\" \"No! I refuse to accept that. You are nothing like him! Nothing, do you hear me?\" \"Perhaps not now, but— \" \"No buts. People make mistakes, but they can change. You\u0027ve changed. You\u0027re not like him anymore and I won\u0027t have you saying you are! Do you hear me, Antonio Battista?\" He laughed softly. \"What a warrior you would have made. You would not have stayed behind while your man went out to fight. No, you would have taken up a sword and ridden beside him.\" \"I don\u0027t know how to ride.\" He laughed again. \"Ah, Victoria, what will I do when you are gone?\" \"I\u0027m not going anywhere,\" she said, but in the back of her mind she heard his voice telling her that, when it was safe, he would leave her so she could return to her old life. Well, he could think that for now if it made him feel better, but he was stuck with her whether he liked it or not. Life with Antonio. He made her feel wonderful, beautiful, and more desirable than any other woman on the planet… life with a vampire… What would it be like to never see him during the day, to eat all her meals alone, to sleep alone, to age while he did not? And what about children? She looked at him, mute, and knew by his expression that he had divined her thoughts. \"I\u0027m sorry… \" \"There is nothing to be sorry about, my sweet. You only want what every woman wants. I wish I could give you everything you want, everything you need, but I cannot.\" She stared at him. How could he talk about it so lightly? He had come into her life like a whirlwind, made her love him, made her need him. Did it mean nothing to him? He was like no one else she had ever known. No man alive could compare to him. His expression told her he knew what she was thinking. \"I can\u0027t believe you really mean to leave me when this is over.\" \"It is for— \" \"Don\u0027t you dare tell me that it\u0027s for the best!\" She wiped the tears from her eyes. \"I thought you loved me. You said you loved me.\" \"Do not doubt it. If I did not love you, I would have seduced you long ago, Victoria Cavendish. I would have taken your love and your blood and left you with nothing.\" Tears dampened her cheeks. She made no move to wipe them away, only stood there looking up at him, her expression filled with anguish. She was hurting, and it was his fault. \" Victoria … \" \"Kiss me.\" He yearned to take her in his arms, to feel her hands on his flesh, her body writhing in ecstasy beneath his. Had he thought he could stop with one kiss, he would gladly have obliged, but he was hurting and weak. Taking blood had eased the pain somewhat, but in his weakened state, he did not trust himself to make love to her without taking more of her blood as well. And if he tasted her again, he did not trust himself to stop. \"I cannot, sweeting. I must go.\" \"But it\u0027s still early.\" \"Yes, but I need to rest.\" Rising, he moved away from her, away from the temptation of warm flesh and pouting lips. \"It will help me heal faster.\" \"You\u0027re not just saying that?\" \"I would not lie to you.\" \"Good night, Antonio.\" \"If you do not see me tomorrow night, do not worry.\" \"Why won\u0027t I see you? Where are you going?\" \"I may sleep through the night.\" \"Oh.\" He murmured, \"Buono notte, my sweet.\" And then, as though to remind her of what he was, he vanished from her sight. \"He loves you very much.\" Vicki looked up to see Lady Kathryn sitting on the edge of the mantel, one leg crossed over the other. \"I know.\" \"Like must marry like,\" Lady Kathryn said wistfully. \"A lady cannot marry a commoner. A vampire cannot marry a mortal.\" She smiled faintly. \"Or even a ghost, mote\u0027s the pity. He is such a delectable creature.\" \"I guess you\u0027re right,\" Vicki said thoughtfully. \"Like must marry like for there to be true togetherness, true happiness.\" Chapter 33 Vicki slept late the next day. After rising, she showered and ate breakfast. She made her bed. She read a book. She watched a movie. She ate lunch. She took a nap. And still it seemed like an eternity until the sun went down. She waited all that night for Antonio to appear. At midnight, she admitted that he wasn\u0027t coming. She couldn\u0027t blame him, not really. If sleep made him feel better and heal faster, then sleep was what he needed. But she missed him terribly just the same. She rose early the following morning, dressed quickly, and drove to the nearest phone booth to call Bobbie Sue. Bobbie Sue answered on the fifth ring. \"Girl,\" she said, yawning, \"do you know what time it is?\" \"Eight-fifteen. Is Duncan there?\" \"Eight-fifteen!\" Bobbie Sue exclaimed. \"I\u0027m late for school! Talk to you later, Vicki. Duncan, telephone.\" A moment later, Tom\u0027s voice came over the receiver. \"Hi, Vicki. Is something wrong?\" \"Yes. Falco is here.\" Tom grunted. \"I guess that explains why things have been so quiet here. Are you all right?\" \"Yes, for now.\" She quickly explained everything that had happened since she had left Pear Blossom Creek. \"We need to find him, and I need your help for that.\" \"I\u0027ll be there as soon as I can. Look for me sometime tomorrow afternoon.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Don\u0027t worry. Just stay inside.\" He paused. \"Does Battista sleep in the house?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Why?\" \"Just curious.\" \"We\u0027re only hunting Falco,\" Vicki reminded him. \"Sure, sure.\" \"If you have any intention of hunting Antonio, then stay there.\" \"Listen, Vicki— \" \"No, you listen. I\u0027m in love with Antonio. If you\u0027re thinking of going after him, then I\u0027ll look for Falco on my own.\" Tom cursed. \"I want your word, Tom.\" \"All right, you\u0027ve got it. I won\u0027t hunt Battista.\" \"You swear?\" \"I swear.\" As soon as she hung up the receiver, she was beset by doubts, doubts that only grew stronger on the ride back home. What would Antonio say when he found out that not only had she called Tom for help, but she had given Battista\u0027s address to a vampire hunter?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-39.html","bookId":2298,"book":{"id":2298,"title":"Desire After Dark (Vampire Trilogy #3)","description":"Storyline: Desire After Dark (Vampire Trilogy #3) Vicki Cavendish knows she should be careful.
