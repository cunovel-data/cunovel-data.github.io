{"id":69777,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"I was busy and happy, but I kept waiting for that momentous phone call. For the next three weeks I spent my mornings working on The Merry Widow, my afternoons working on Jackpot, and my evenings working with Ben on both shows. I was getting exhausted. I decided I needed some relaxation. On a Sunday, I went to the USO, a New York entertainment center for soldiers on leave. There was music, beautiful young women, dancing, and food. It was like an oasis from the war. An attractive blond hostess came up to me. \"Would you like to dance, soldier?\" Indeed, I would. Just as we began to dance, I felt a hand tap my shoulder. I said, \"Hey, we just started. No cutting - \" I turned around. There were two large MPs standing there. \"You\u0027re under arrest, soldier. Let\u0027s go.\" Under arrest? \"What\u0027s the trouble?\" \"Impersonating an officer.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"You\u0027re wearing an officer\u0027s uniform. Where\u0027s your officer\u0027s insignia?\" \"I don\u0027t have any. I\u0027m not an officer.\" \"That\u0027s why you\u0027re under arrest. Come along.\" They took hold of both my arms. \"Wait a minute. You\u0027re making a big mistake. I\u0027m allowed to wear this.\" \"Who gave you permission, your mother?\" They started to pull me off the dance floor. I was in a panic. \"You don\u0027t understand. I\u0027m in a special branch of the Air Corps and - \" \"Right.\" I kept talking while they were shoving me toward the door. \"I\u0027m serious. Have you ever heard of a division of the Army called War Training Service?\" \"No.\" We were outside. There was an official car parked at the curb. \"Get in.\" I dug in my heels. \"I won\u0027t go. You\u0027ve got to make a phone call. I\u0027m telling you that I\u0027m in the Army Air Corps, in a branch called War Training Service, and we can wear anything we damn please.\" The two MPs were looking at each other. \"I think you\u0027re nuts,\" one of them said, \"but I\u0027ll make the call. Who do I call?\" I gave him the number. He turned to his buddy. \"You hang on to him. We\u0027re going to throw in \u0027resisting arrest.\u0027 I\u0027ll be back.\" Twenty minutes later the MP returned, a bewildered look on his face. \"What happened?\" the other MP asked. \"I talked to a general and got chewed out for not knowing about an outfit called War Training Service.\" \"You mean it\u0027s legitimate?\" \"I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s legitimate, but it\u0027s real. It\u0027s a branch of the Army Air Corps.\" The other MP released my arm. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"I guess we made a mistake.\" I nodded. \"It\u0027s all right.\" I went back inside. My girl was dancing with someone else. Guy Bolton was a pleasure to work with. He had written many successful plays and was very knowledgeable about the theater. He spoke in English idioms and it was our job to convert them to American phrases. I remembered the line of George Bernard Shaw: \"The Americans and the English are divided by a common language.\" Guy had rented a beautiful home on Long Island and on weekends Ben and I worked with him there. He was very social and had an interesting group of friends. At a dinner party there one evening, I was seated next to one of the most beautiful young women I had ever seen. \"Guy tells me that you\u0027re writing a Broadway musical with him,\" she said. \"Yes.\" \"That\u0027s interesting.\" \"What do you do?\" I asked. \"I\u0027m an actress.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t get your name.\" \"Wendy Barrie.\" Wendy was British and she had made half a dozen pictures in England. Her godfather was J. M. Barrie, and he had used Wendy\u0027s name in Peter Pan. I found her fascinating, but she seemed to be preoccupied. When dinner was over I asked, \"Are you all right?\" She shook her head. \"Let\u0027s go for a walk.\" We went outside and started walking down a moonlit gravel path. Because of the wartime blackout there were no electric lights and the only illumination came from a full moon. As we walked, Wendy began to cry. I stopped. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"Nothing . . . Everything . . . I don\u0027t know what to do.\" \"What\u0027s happening?\" \"It\u0027s my - my boyfriend. He - he beats me.\" She could barely get the words out. I was filled with indignation. \"Why would you let him?\" I said. \"Nobody should be allowed to behave like that. Why don\u0027t you leave him?\" \"I - I - don\u0027t know. It\u0027s - it\u0027s difficult.\" She began sobbing. I put my arm around her. \"Wendy, listen to me. If he\u0027s beating you now, you can be sure it will only get worse. Leave him while you can.\" \"I know you\u0027re right,\" she said. She took a deep breath. \"I\u0027m going to.\" \"Good for you.\" \"I feel better. Thank you.\" \"My pleasure. Do you live in New York?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you doing anything tomorrow night?\" She looked at me and said, \"No.\" \"Let\u0027s have dinner.\" \"I\u0027d love to.\" The following night, Wendy Barrie and I had dinner at Sardi\u0027s and we enjoyed each other\u0027s company. We were together for the next two weeks. One Friday morning, I got a telephone call. \"Sidney?\" \"Yes.\" \"Do you enjoy your life?\" \"Very much. Why?\" \"If you do, stop seeing Wendy Barrie.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"Do you know who\u0027s paying her rent?\" \"No. We never - she never told me.\" \"Bugsy Siegel.\" The hit man for the mob. I never saw Wendy Barrie again. I met our two Jackpot stars, Allan Jones and Nanette Fabray. Allan Jones was movie star handsome, just under six feet, with a powerful physique and a wry smile. He had a wonderful singing voice and was a recording icon. Nanette Fabray was a real charmer. She was in her early twenties, had a great body, an upbeat personality, and was a natural comedienne - perfect for the part. I had a good feeling about the show. After rehearsal one day, Roy Hargrave, the director of Jackpot, said, \"You boys are doing a great job on the script.\" I thought of Yolanda Mero-Irion. A disaster. \"Thank you, Roy.\" \"I have a friend who\u0027s producing a musical and he\u0027s looking for a writer. I told him about you. Would you like to meet him?\" Impossible. Ben and I were already writing two shows, and I was going to be called back to the Air Corps any minute. \"Love to,\" I said. \"His name is Richard Kollmar. He\u0027s married to Dorothy Kilgallen.\" I read Dorothy Kilgallen\u0027s popular newspaper column. She and Kollmar were a power couple on the Broadway scene. \"I\u0027m going to call and make an appointment for you with Dick.\" Roy Hargrave made a telephone call and when he finished, he said, \"Ten o\u0027clock tomorrow morning.\" Richard Kollmar had produced, directed, and acted in hit Broadway musicals, and he was only in his early thirties. He was slim, enthusiastic, and welcoming. \"Roy told me that you\u0027re a really good writer,\" he said. \"I\u0027m doing a fantasy musical. It\u0027s going to be a big production with great sets and costumes. It\u0027s about a soap opera writer who falls asleep and dreams that she is Scheherazade and that she must continuously tell stories to the sultan or die.\" \"Sounds interesting. Who\u0027s playing Scheherazade?\" \"Vera Zorina.\" The world-famous ballet dancer who had become a Broadway star, and who was, incidentally, married to George Balanchine. \"Ronald Graham is playing opposite her. Would you like to write the show with Dorothy?\" \"I\u0027d love it,\" I said. \"By the way, I have a collaborator.\" He nodded. \"Ben Roberts. How soon can you start?\" \"Right away.\" Ben and I could get some sleep after the war. I called Ben as soon as I got back to the hotel. \"We\u0027re writing a musical for Richard Kollmar called Dream with Music.\" \"Wait a minute,\" he said. \"Why did the other shows drop us?\" \"They didn\u0027t. We\u0027re still doing those.\" \"We\u0027re writing three Broadway shows at once?\" \"Doesn\u0027t everyone?\" I was still wearing my uniform, waiting for the call to report for advanced flight training. But now I was so busy writing all three shows that I hoped the call would be delayed. I needed only two or three more months. The gods must have been laughing. Two hours after I met with Richard Kollmar and accepted the assignment, the Phone Call came. \"Sidney Sheldon?\" \"Yes.\" \"This is Major Baker. You have orders to report tomorrow morning at 0900 to Captain Burns at Army headquarters in the Bronx.\" My heart sank. The timing could not have been worse. We were deserting three shows. Ben was available only at night, and I would be overseas somewhere. Captain Burns was a tall, bald man, wearing a neatly pressed uniform. He looked up as I walked into his office. \"Sheldon?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Sit down.\" I took a seat. He studied me a moment. \"You finished primary flight training?\" \"Yes, sir.\" He glanced at a paper on his desk. \"And you\u0027re scheduled to go to a secondary flight school?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Those plans have been changed.\" I was puzzled. \"Changed?\" \"The war has taken a new turn. We\u0027re on the offensive now. We\u0027re going after the bastards. What we need are fighter pilots. You\u0027re not qualified because of your eyesight. We have orders to disband the entire War Training Service unit.\" It took me a moment to digest it. \"What does that - ?\" \"All the volunteers in WTS are being given a choice. You can report to an infantry unit as a private in the Army or we can turn your name back to your draft board.\" Hobson\u0027s choice. But I needed the time. It would probably take the draft board at least a month to process my papers before they sent me overseas and I could use that time working on the shows. \"I prefer the draft board, sir.\" He made a note. \"Fine. You\u0027ll hear from them.\" I did not doubt it. The question was when? How much time would I have to work with Ben and Guy and Dorothy to get the shows in shape? I knew we could do a great deal in one month, working seven days a week. If the Army gave me one month . . . When I returned to my hotel, I immediately called Ben. \"We\u0027ll be working very late tonight.\" \"What\u0027s happened?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you when you get here.\" \"Late\" turned out to be three A.M., when Ben finally stumbled out of our hotel room and returned to Fort Dix. Ben had been as dismayed by the news as I was. I tried to reassure him. \"Don\u0027t worry. Draft boards move slowly.\" During the next three days, I worked feverishly, going from theater to theater, working against the time that the call would come from the draft board. On the fourth day, when I returned to my hotel, the hotel clerk handed me a letter. It began: Greetings. My heart sank. I was to report to the draft board in the Bronx the following day. My career as a playwright was over before it had begun. I was deserting three shows that had been counting on me, and I would be going overseas to face possible death. And suddenly I was filled with an overwhelming sense of elation. I knew my emotions were completely out of control. I had no idea what was the matter with me. I looked at the idiotically happy face in the mirror and I began to cry. The next morning at nine o\u0027clock, I reported for my physical examination at Army draft headquarters. It was the same examination I had had in California. It was over in thirty minutes and I was asked to report to the doctor\u0027s office. He was studying a sheet of paper. \"Your medical report shows that you have a herniated disc.\" \"Yes, sir. But they knew that when I had my first examination and they - \" He interrupted me. \"They had no business accepting you. If you suffered an attack during a combat engagement, you could endanger not only yourself, but everyone around you. That is not acceptable.\" \"Sir - \" \"I\u0027m marking you 4F.\" I was speechless. \"I\u0027ll notify your draft board in California. You\u0027re dismissed.\" I sat there for a long moment, stunned, trying to comprehend what had just happened. Then I got up to leave. As I walked toward the door, he said, \"And take off that uniform.\" I was a civilian again. It was with a feeling of unreality that I went into a clothing store that afternoon and bought two suits, some shorts, shirts, and ties. I was ready to go back to work being a playwright. On August 4, 1943, The Merry Widow opened at the Majestic Theatre, and it turned out to be one of the most successful revivals ever to play on Broadway. The reviews were raves. The New York Times: \"A worthy revival.\" The Herald Tribune: \"Gives the town something to be proud of and happy over.\" The Mirror: \"Beautiful, opulent, tasteful and tuneful.\" The Journal-American: \"A lovely, relaxing, charming, laughing love story.\" Walter Winchell: \"August had a first night boom. The Merry Widow was revived into a sellout.\" Howard Barnes: \"The new season has been gladdened by a delicious revival. The Merry Widow has been brought to the Majestic with taste, melodic eloquence and pageantry.\" Frank Sullivan: \"I\u0027m happy to report that The Merry Widow book has been dusted off and reupholstered very deftly by the Messrs. Sidney Sheldon and Ben Roberts.\" One down, two to go. The show ran on Broadway for nearly a year and toured for another two years. On opening night, after the show, the whole company went to Sardi\u0027s to celebrate. Vincent Sardi was standing near the door. I walked up to him and said, \"I can pay you back now, Mr. Sardi.\" He smiled. \"You\u0027ve already paid me back. I saw the show tonight.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-14.html","bookId":2371,"book":{"id":2371,"title":"The Other Side of Me","description":"Storyline: Growing up in 1930s America, the young Sidney knew what it was to struggle to get by.
