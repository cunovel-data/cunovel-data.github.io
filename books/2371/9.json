{"id":69772,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"It took a streetcar and two buses to get me to Culver City. On the second bus, I looked around at the passengers and wanted to tell them all that I was on my way to see David Selznick. The bus dropped me off two blocks from the Selznick International Studios.\\n\\n The studio was a large, imposing Georgian structure, fronting on Washington Street. It was familiar because I recognized it from the opening credits of David Selznick\u0027s movies.\\n\\n I hurried inside and said to the woman behind the desk, \"I have an appointment with Mr. Selznick\u0027s secretary.\" At least I was going to meet David Selznick now.\\n\\n \"Your name?\"\\n\\n \"Sidney Sheldon.\"\\n\\n She reached into the desk and pulled out a thick package. \"This is for you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. I thought maybe I could see Mr. Selznick and - \"\\n\\n \"No. Mr. Selznick is a busy man.\"\\n\\n So I would meet David Selznick later.\\n\\n Clutching the package, I left the building and started running down the street, toward the MGM studios, six blocks away, reviewing my plan as I ran. It stemmed from a conversation with Seymour about Sydney Singer, his ex-wife.\\n\\n Do you ever see her, Seymour?\\n\\n No. She went to Hollywood. She got a job as a secretary at MGM for a woman director. Dorothy Arzner.\\n\\n I was going to ask Sydney Singer to help me. It was a long, long, long shot, but it was all I had.\\n\\n When I reached the MGM studios, I went up to the guard behind the desk in the lobby. \"My name is Sidney Sheldon. I want to see Sydney Singer.\"\\n\\n \"Sydney . . . Oh - Dorothy Arzner\u0027s secretary.\"\\n\\n I nodded knowingly. \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"Is she expecting you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said confidently.\\n\\n He picked up the phone and dialed an extension. \"Sidney Sheldon is here to see you . . .\" He repeated slowly, \"Sidney Sheldon.\" He listened a moment. \"But he said - \"\\n\\n I stood there, paralyzed. Say yes. Say yes. Say yes.\\n\\n \"Right.\" He replaced the receiver. \"She\u0027ll see you. Room 230.\"\\n\\n My heart started beating again. \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"Take the elevator, over there.\"\\n\\n I took the elevator and hurried down a corridor on the second floor. Sydney\u0027s office was at the end of the corridor. When I walked in, she was seated behind her desk.\\n\\n \"Hello, Sydney.\"\\n\\n \"Hello.\" There was no warmth in her voice. And I suddenly remembered the rest of the conversation with Seymour. She hates my guts. She said she never wants to see me again. What the hell had I gotten myself into? Would she ask me to sit down? No.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n Oh, I just dropped in to ask you to spend your afternoon as my unpaid secretary. \"It\u0027s - it\u0027s a long story.\"\\n\\n She looked at her watch and rose. \"I\u0027m on my way to lunch.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t!\"\\n\\n She was staring at me. \"I can\u0027t go to lunch?\"\\n\\n I took a deep breath. \"Sydney - I - I\u0027m in trouble.\" I poured out the whole story, starting with the fiasco in New York, my ambition of becoming a writer, my inability to get past any of the studio guards, and the telephone call that morning from David Selznick.\\n\\n She listened, and as I got to the end of the story, her lips tightened. \"You took the Selznick assignment because you expected me to spend the afternoon typing for you?\"\\n\\n It was a bitter divorce. She hates my guts.\\n\\n \"I - I didn\u0027t expect it,\" I said. \"I was just hoping that - \" It was hard to breathe. I had acted stupidly. \"I\u0027m sorry I bothered you, Sydney. I had no right to ask this of you.\"\\n\\n \"No, you didn\u0027t. What are you going to do now?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to take this book back to Mr. Selznick. Tomorrow morning I\u0027ll leave for Chicago. Thanks anyway, Sydney. I appreciate your listening to me. Goodbye.\" I started for the door, in despair.\\n\\n \"Wait a minute.\"\\n\\n I turned.\\n\\n \"This means a lot to you, doesn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n I nodded. I was too upset to speak.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s open that package and take a look at it.\"\\n\\n It took a moment for her words to sink in. I said, \"Sydney - \"\\n\\n \"Shut up. Let me see the book.\"\\n\\n \"You mean you might - \"\\n\\n \"What you\u0027ve done is the most insane thing I\u0027ve ever heard. But I admire your determination.\" She smiled for the first time. \"I\u0027m going to help you.\"\\n\\n A feeling of relief flooded through me. I couldn\u0027t stop grinning. I watched her riffle through the book.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s long,\" she said. \"How do you expect to finish this synopsis by six o\u0027clock?\"\\n\\n Good question.\\n\\n She handed the book back to me. I glanced at the inside cover to get a quick idea of what it was about. It was a period romance, the kind of story that Selznick seemed to enjoy making.\\n\\n \"How are we going to do this?\" Sydney asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to skim the pages,\" I explained, \"and when I come to a story point, I\u0027ll dictate it to you.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"Let\u0027s see how it works.\"\\n\\n I took a chair opposite her and began turning pages. In the next fifteen minutes, I had a fairly clear sense of the story. I began skimming through the book, dictating when I came to something that seemed pertinent to the plot. She typed as I talked.\\n\\n To this day, I don\u0027t know what made Sydney agree to help me. Was it because I had blundered into an impossible situation, or because I looked desperate? I will never know. But I do know that she sat at her desk all that afternoon, typing the pages as I thumbed through the book.\\n\\n The clock was racing. We were only halfway through the novel when Sydney said, \"It\u0027s four o\u0027clock.\"\\n\\n I started reading faster and talking faster.\\n\\n By the time I finished dictating the thirty-page synopsis, the two-page summary, and the one-page comment, it was exactly ten minutes to six.\\n\\n As Sydney handed me the last page, I said gratefully, \"If there is anything I can ever do for you - \"\\n\\n She smiled. \"A lunch will be fine.\"\\n\\n I kissed her on the cheek, stuffed the pages into the envelope with the book, and raced out of the office. I ran all the way back to the Selznick International Studios, and arrived there at one minute to six.\\n\\n I said to the same woman behind the desk, \"My name is Sheldon. I want to see Mr. Selznick\u0027s secretary.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s been waiting for you,\" she said.\\n\\n As I hurried down the corridor, I knew that this was just the beginning. I had read that Selznick had started as a reader at MGM, so we had something in common that we could chat about.\\n\\n Selznick will put me on the staff. I\u0027ll have an office here. Wait until Natalie and Otto hear that I\u0027m working for him.\\n\\n I reached his secretary\u0027s office. When I walked in, she looked at her watch. \"I was getting worried about you,\" she said.\\n\\n \"No problem,\" I told her, nonchalantly. I handed her the package and watched her glance through the pages.\\n\\n \"This is beautifully done.\" She handed me an envelope. \"There\u0027s ten dollars in there.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you. I\u0027m ready to do the next synopsis whenever - \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said, \"our regular reader will be back tomorrow. Mr. Selznick doesn\u0027t usually use outside readers. As a matter of fact, you were called by mistake.\"\\n\\n I swallowed. \"Mistake?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. You\u0027re not on our regular list of readers.\"\\n\\n So I was never going to be a part of David Selznick\u0027s team. We were not going to have a cozy chat about his days as a reader. This frantic day had been the beginning and the end. At that moment, I should have been deeply depressed. Oddly enough, I felt happy. Why? I had no idea.\\n\\n When I reached Gracie\u0027s, the boys were waiting for me.\\n\\n \"Did you see Selznick?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s he like?\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to work there?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been an interesting afternoon,\" I said. \"Very interesting.\" And I went into my room and closed the door.\\n\\n I saw the bus ticket on the table next to my bed. It was the symbol of failure. It meant going back to the checkrooms and the drugstore and parking cars and the life I thought I had escaped from. I had reached a dead end. I picked up the bus ticket and it was all I could do to keep from tearing it in half. How could I turn this failure into a success? There has to be a way. There has to be a way.\\n\\n And then it came to me. I called home. Natalie answered the phone. \"Hello, darling. We can\u0027t wait to see you. Are you all right?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine. I have some good news. I just did a synopsis for David Selznick.\"\\n\\n \"Really? That\u0027s wonderful! Was he nice?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Couldn\u0027t have been nicer. And this is only the beginning. The gates here have opened, Natalie. Everything is going to be great. I just need a few more days.\"\\n\\n She did not hesitate. \"All right, darling. Let us know when you\u0027re coming home.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m not coming home.\\n\\n The following morning, I went to the bus station and cashed in the ticket Otto had sent me. I spent the rest of the day writing letters to the literary departments of all the major studios.\\n\\n The letters read, in part:\\n\\n At his personal request, I have just finished a synopsis of a novel for David O. Selznick, and I\u0027m now free to do other synopses . . .\\n\\n The telephone calls began coming in two days later. Twentieth-Century-Fox called first, then Paramount. Fox needed a book synopsized and Paramount wanted me to synopsize a play. Each synopsis paid five or ten dollars, depending on the length.\\n\\n Since each studio had its own staff of readers, the only time they called in outside readers was when they were overburdened. I could do only one novel a day. It took me that long to get to a studio to pick it up, return to Gracie\u0027s boardinghouse, read the book, type a synopsis, and take it back to the studio. I averaged two or three calls a week. I didn\u0027t have Sydney in my life anymore.\\n\\n To augment my meager income, I telephoned a man I had never met. Vera Fine had mentioned him on the drive to California. His name was Gordon Mitchell. He was head of the Technical Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\\n\\n I called and mentioned Vera Fine\u0027s name, and told him I was looking for a job. He was very cordial. \"As a matter of fact, I have something here that you can do.\"\\n\\n I was thrilled. I would be working for the esteemed Academy.\\n\\n The following day, I met him in his office.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s perfect timing,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll be working evenings here, watching films in our projection room.\"\\n\\n \"Great,\" I said. \"What\u0027s the job?\"\\n\\n \"Watching films in our projection room.\"\\n\\n I was staring at him. He went on to explain.\\n\\n \"The Academy is testing different film preservatives. We\u0027ve coated different sections of the film with different chemicals. Your job is to sit in the projection room and keep a record of the number of times each film is run.\" He added, apologetically, \"I\u0027m afraid it only pays three dollars a day.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take it.\"\\n\\n The first movie I saw over and over was The Man Who Lived Twice, and I was soon able to quote every line. I spent my evenings watching the same films and my days waiting for the telephone to ring.\\n\\n On the fateful date of December 12, 1938, I received a call from Universal Studios. I had just done a few synopses for them.\\n\\n \"Sidney Sheldon?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Could you come in to the studio this morning?\"\\n\\n Another three dollars.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Go to Mr. Townsend\u0027s office.\"\\n\\n Al Townsend was the story editor at Universal. When I arrived at the studio, I was ushered into his office.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve read the synopses you\u0027ve done for us. They\u0027re very good.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"We need a staff reader here. Would you like the job?\"\\n\\n I wondered if he would be offended if I kissed him. \"Yes, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n \"It pays seventeen dollars a week. We work six days a week. Your hours will be from nine to six. You\u0027ll start Monday.\"\\n\\n I called Sydney at her office to break the news to her and invite her to dinner.\\n\\n An unfamiliar voice answered the phone. \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"I would like to speak to Sydney Singer.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not here.\"\\n\\n \"When will she be back?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not coming back.\"\\n\\n \"What - ? Who is this?\"\\n\\n \"This is Dorothy Arzner.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. Do you have her forwarding address, Miss Arzner?\"\\n\\n \"She didn\u0027t leave one.\"\\n\\n I never saw Sydney again, but I have never forgotten the debt I owe her.\\n\\n Universal was a studio that made B pictures. It had been founded by Carl \"Papa\" Laemmle in 1912, and it was noted for its thriftiness. A few years earlier the studio had called the agent of a top western star and said they wanted to hire him to work on a low-budget movie.\\n\\n The agent laughed. \"You can\u0027t afford him. He makes a thousand dollars a day.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right,\" the studio executive assured him. \"We\u0027ll pay him.\"\\n\\n The movie was about a masked bandit. The first day of production the director shot endless close-ups of the star in various locations, and at the end of the day they told him that he was finished. What they did after that was to substitute a minor actor who wore a mask throughout the picture.\\n\\n On Monday morning, when I walked through the gates onto a studio lot for the first time, I was filled with a sense of wonder. I walked past the facades of western towns and Victorian houses, San Francisco streets and New York streets, and felt the magic.\\n\\n Al Townsend explained my duties to me. My job was to read the dozens and dozens of screenplays that had been written for silent movies and to try to weed out the ones that might be worth making into talkies. Nearly all of the screenplays were hopeless. I remember one memorable line describing a villain:\\n\\n He had a bag of gold in his eyes.\\n\\n During Papa Laemmle\u0027s regime, Universal was an easygoing, shirt-sleeved kind of studio. There was no feeling of pressure. It was like a large family.\\n\\n I was now receiving a weekly paycheck and I was able to pay Gracie regularly. I reported to the studio six days a week and never got over the thrill of walking onto the studio lot where dreams were created every day. I knew that this was just the beginning. I had come to Universal as a reader, but I would start working again on original stories and sell them to the studio. I wrote to Natalie and Otto to tell them how well things were going. I had a permanent job in Hollywood.\\n\\n One month later, Papa Laemmle sold Universal and along with everyone else, I was fired.\\n\\n I did not dare tell Natalie or Otto what had happened because they would insist that I return to Chicago. I knew that my future was here. I would have to find another job - any job - until I could get back into a studio.\\n\\n I looked through the want ads. One item caught my eye:\\n\\n Hotel switchboard operator wanted.\\n\\n No experience necessary. $20 a week. Brant Hotel.\\n\\n The Brant Hotel was a chic hotel off Hollywood Boulevard. When I arrived there, the lobby was deserted except for the hotel manager.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here about the switchboard operator job,\" I said.\\n\\n He studied me a moment. \"Our telephone operator just quit. We need someone right away. Have you ever run a switchboard?\"\\n\\n \"No, sir.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s really not much to it.\"\\n\\n He took me behind a desk, where there was a large, complicated-looking switchboard.\\n\\n \"Sit down,\" he said.\\n\\n I sat down. The switchboard consisted of two rows of vertical plugs and about thirty holes to plug them into, each hole connected to a numbered room.\\n\\n \"You see these plugs?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re in twos, one above the other. The lower one is called the sister plug. When the board lights up, you put the front plug into that hole. The caller will tell you the room he wants and then you take the sister plug and plug it into that room number, and you move this button to ring the room. That\u0027s all there is to it.\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"That\u0027s easy.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll give you a week\u0027s trial. You\u0027ll work nights.\"\\n\\n \"No problem,\" I said.\\n\\n \"How soon can you start?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve started.\"\\n\\n The manager had been right. Running a switchboard was easy. It became almost automatic. When a light flashed, I would put in a plug from the first row. \"Mr. Klemann, please.\"\\n\\n I would look at the roster of guests. Mr. Klemann was in Room 231. I put the sister plug into the hole for Room 231 and pushed the button that rang the room. It was as simple as that.\\n\\n I had a feeling that operating a switchboard was just a beginning. I could move up to night manager, and then perhaps general manager, and since the hotel was part of a chain, there was no telling how high I could go, and I would write a screenplay about the hotel business with the knowledge of an insider, sell it to a studio, and be back where I wanted to be.\\n\\n Two nights after I had started, at three o\u0027clock in the morning, one of the guests rang the switchboard. \"I want you to get a number for me in New York.\"\\n\\n He gave me the number.\\n\\n I pulled out the room plug and dialed the New York number.\\n\\n After half a dozen rings, a woman answered. \"Hello.\"\\n\\n \"I have a call for you,\" I said. \"Just a moment, please.\"\\n\\n I picked up the key that plugged into the guest rooms and stared at the switchboard. I had no idea which guest had placed the call. I looked at the holes in the switchboard, hoping for inspiration. I knew generally what area of the board the caller was in. I began ringing all the rooms in that section, hoping to find the right one. I awakened a dozen guests.\\n\\n \"I have the New York call for you.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know anyone in New York.\"\\n\\n \"I have the New York call for you.\"\\n\\n \"Are you out of your mind? It\u0027s three o\u0027clock in the morning!\"\\n\\n \"I have the New York call for you.\"\\n\\n \"Not me, you idiot!\"\\n\\n When the hotel manager arrived in the morning, I said, \"A funny thing happened last night. I - \"\\n\\n \"I heard, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s funny. You\u0027re fired.\"\\n\\n I obviously was not destined to manage a hotel chain. It was time to move on.\\n\\n There was an ad for a part-time driving instructor and I took the job. Most of the students were scary. Red lights meant nothing to them and they all seemed confused about the difference between the brake and the accelerator. They were nervous, blind, or bent on suicide. Every time I went to work, I felt I was putting my life on the line.\\n\\n I kept my sanity by doing outside reading for various studios, when their own readers were busy. One of the studios I had written synopses for was Twentieth-Century-Fox. The story editor was James Fisher, a bright young New Yorker.\\n\\n Late one afternoon, he telephoned me. \"Are you free tomorrow?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Another three dollars.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see you at ten o\u0027clock.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" Maybe it would be a big book. Ten dollars. My funds were running low again.\\n\\n When I got to his office, Fisher was waiting for me. \"How would you like a staff job here?\" he asked.\\n\\n I could hardly get the words out. \"I - I\u0027d love it.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re hired. Twenty-three dollars a week.\"\\n\\n I was back in show business. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-9.html","bookId":2371,"book":{"id":2371,"title":"The Other Side of Me","description":"Storyline: Growing up in 1930s America, the young Sidney knew what it was to struggle to get by.
