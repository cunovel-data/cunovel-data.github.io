Otto got a part-time job working in a boiler room on the South Side, an operation that would now be called telemarketing, the object being to sell products to strangers over the telephone. This particular operation was in a large bare room, with a dozen men, each with a telephone, talking simultaneously to prospects, trying to sell them oil wells, hot stocks, or anything else that would sound like an inviting investment. It was a high-pressure operation. The names and phone numbers of potential customers were obtained from master lists sold to whomever was running boiler rooms. The salesmen got a commission on the sales they made. Otto would come home at night and talk excitedly about the boiler room. Since it was open seven days a week, I decided to drop by to see if I could earn some extra money on Sundays. Otto arranged for me to have a tryout, and the following Sunday I went to work with him. When I arrived, I stood there, in the dreary room, listening to the sales pitches. \". . . Mr. Collins, it\u0027s a lucky thing for you that I was able to reach you. My name is Jason Richards and I have some great news for you. You and your family have just won a free VIP trip to Bermuda. All you have to do is send me a check for . . .\" \". . . Mr. Adams, I have some wonderful news for you. My name is Brown, Jim Brown. I know that you invest in stocks, and there\u0027s a new issue coming out that\u0027s going to have a hundred percent rise in the next six weeks. Not many people know about it, but if you want to make some real money . . .\" \". . . Mrs. Doyle, this is Charlie Chase. Congratulations. You and your husband and little Amanda and Peter have been selected for a free trip to . . .\" And so it went. It amazed me how many people actually bought the pie-in-the-sky offered by the salesmen. For some reason, doctors seemed to be the most gullible. They would buy almost anything. Most of the products that were sold were either defective, overpriced, inferior, or nonexistent. I had my fill of the boiler room that Sunday and never returned. My job at Mandel Brothers was boring and easy, but I was not looking for easy. I wanted a challenge, something that would give me a chance to grow. I knew that if I did well there, I would have a chance of moving up. One day I might be made head of the department. Mandel Brothers had a chain of stores around the country, so in time I could become a regional manager and even work my way up to president. On a Monday morning, my boss, Mr. Young, came over to me. \"I have some bad news for you, Schechtel.\" I was staring at him. \"What?\" \"I\u0027m going to have to let you go.\" I tried to sound calm. \"Did I do something wrong?\" \"No. All the departments have orders to cut overhead. You were the last one hired, so you\u0027re going to have to be the first to go.\" I felt as though someone had taken my heart and squeezed it. I needed this job desperately. He had no idea that he was not only firing a clerk in the haberdashery department, but that he was firing the future president of the company. I knew I had to find another job as quickly as possible. Debts were piling up. We owed grocery bills, the landlord was getting nasty, and our utilities, which had already been shut off several times, were about to be shut off again. I thought of someone who might be able to help. Charley Fine, a longtime friend of my father, was an executive at a large manufacturing company. I asked Otto whether he thought it would be all right if I talked to Charley about getting a job. Otto thought about it for a moment, looked at me and said, \"I\u0027ll talk to him for you.\" The following morning, I was walking through the huge gates of the Stewart Warner factory, the world\u0027s largest manufacturer of automobile gears. The factory was housed in a five-story building that took up an entire block on Diversey Street. A guard escorted me through the factory floor, crowded with huge, arcane machines that looked like prehistoric monsters. The noise from the machines was incredible. Otto Karp, a short, heavyset man with a thick German accent, was waiting for me. \"So, you\u0027re going to work here,\" he said. \"Yes, sir.\" He looked disappointed. \"Follow me.\" We started walking across the huge factory floor. All the machines were running at full speed. As we approached one of the machines, Karp said, \"This makes drive and driven gears for speedometers. They turn the flexible shaft that drives the speedometer. Understand?\" I had no idea what he was talking about. \"Right.\" He led me over to the machine next to it. \"What you see coming out here are round drive gears that are pressed into the output shaft of the transmission. The long one is the driven gear that\u0027s inserted at a right angle to mesh with the drive gear.\" I looked at him and wondered: Chinese? Swahili? We went to the next machine. \"Here they\u0027re making drive gears that press onto the front wheel hub. The driven gear is fixed to the brake backing plate to measure the drive gear. See?\" I nodded. He walked me over to another machine. \"This machine replaces worn gears. The transmission gearing has been standard for a long time. The advantage of the front wheel systems is that axle ratios can be changed, or multiple-ratio rear axles can be used without affecting the speedometer accuracy. See?\" Swahili, I decided. \"Of course.\" \"Now I\u0027ll show you your department.\" He took me over to the short order department, where I was to take charge. The machines I had been introduced to were mammoth and were built to turn out huge orders for automobile manufacturers, a half a million gears or more at a time. The short order department consisted of three much smaller machines. Otto Karp explained, \"If someone orders five or ten gears, we can\u0027t afford to start up the big machines for that small an order. But these machines here are equipped to turn out as few as one or two gears. When a short order comes in, you will handle it and it can be filled right away.\" \"How do I do that?\" \"First, you will be handed a purchase order. The order can be for anywhere from one to a dozen drive or driven gears. Next, you give the order to the machinist. When the gears are ready, you\u0027ll take them to the annealing department, where they\u0027ll be hardened. Your next stop is inspection and finally the wrapping department.\" It sounded simple enough. I learned that my predecessor had given the men who worked in the short order department no more than six orders a day. The rest he held back, and the men sat around half the day, doing nothing. I thought it was a waste. Within a month, I had increased the output by fifty percent. At Christmastime, I got my reward. Otto Karp handed me a check for fourteen dollars and said, \"Here. You deserve it. You have a dollar raise.\" Otto was traveling on the road and Natalie was working six days a week at a dress shop. Richard was going to school. My days at Stewart Warner, working in the drab surroundings of the factory, surrounded by surrealistic machinery, had become mind-numbing. My evenings were just as bad. I rode the El downtown to the Loop, walked into the hotel where I was working, and spent the next few hours receiving and returning overcoats. My life had become an ugly gray rut again and there was no way out. Riding home on the El late one night, coming from work, an ad in The Chicago Tribune caught my eye: Paul Ash Is Sponsoring an Amateur Contest Start your career in show business Paul Ash, a nationally known band leader, was appearing at the Chicago Theatre. The ad was catnip to me. I had no idea what the amateur contest was about, but I knew I wanted to be in it. On Saturday, before I went to work at the drugstore, I stopped at the Chicago Theatre and asked to see Paul Ash. His manager came out of an office. \"What can I do for you?\" \"I\u0027d like to enter the amateur contest,\" I said. He consulted a paper. \"We don\u0027t have an announcer yet. Can you handle that?\" \"Oh. Yes, sir.\" \"Good. What\u0027s your name?\" What was my name? Schechtel was not a show business name. People were always misspelling it and mispronouncing it. I needed a name they would remember. The possibilities raced through my mind. Gable, Cooper, Grant, Stewart, Powell . . . The man was staring at me. \"Don\u0027t you know your name?\" \"Of course I do,\" I said quickly. \"It\u0027s Sidney Sh - Sheldon. Sidney Sheldon.\" He wrote it down. \"All right. Be here next Saturday, Sheldon. Six o\u0027clock. You\u0027ll be broadcasting from the studio on a remote from WGN.\" Whatever that meant. \"Right.\" I hurried home to break the news to my parents and my brother, Richard. They were excited. There was one more thing I had to tell them. \"I\u0027m using a different name.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Well, Schechtel is not a show business name. From now on, I\u0027m Sidney Sheldon.\" They looked at one another and then shrugged. \"Okay.\" I had difficulty sleeping for the next few nights. I knew that this finally was the beginning. I was going to win this contest. Paul Ash would give me a contract to travel around the country with him. Sidney Sheldon would travel around the country with him. When Saturday reluctantly dragged its way onto the calendar, I returned to the Chicago Theatre and was ushered into a small broadcast studio, with several other young contestants. There was a comedian, a singer, a female pianist, and an accordion player. The director said to me, \"Sheldon - \" I felt a little thrill. It was the first time anyone had spoken my new name. \"Yes, sir?\" \"When I point to you, you\u0027ll step up to the microphone and start the show. You\u0027ll say, \u0027Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Paul Ash Amateur Contest. This is your announcer, Sidney Sheldon. We\u0027re going to give you an exciting show, so stay tuned!\u0027 Got that?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Fifteen minutes later, the director looked up at the studio clock on the wall and raised his arm. \"Quiet, everyone.\" He began counting. He pointed to me and I was ready for show business. I had never been calmer in my life because I knew that this was the beginning of a wonderful career. And I was going to start under my new show business name. With great composure, I stepped up to the microphone, took a deep breath, and said, in my best announcer\u0027s voice, \"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Paul Ash Amateur Contest. This is your announcer - Sidney Schechtel.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-5.html","bookId":2371,"book":{"id":2371,"title":"The Other Side of Me","description":"Storyline: Growing up in 1930s America, the young Sidney knew what it was to struggle to get by.
