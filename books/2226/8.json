{"id":107030,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Susan\u0027s mind was racing-Ensei Tankado wrote a program that creates unbreakable codes! She could barely grasp the thought.\n \"Digital Fortress,\" Strathmore said. \"That\u0027s what he\u0027s calling it. It\u0027s the ultimate counterintelligence weapon. If this program hits the market, every third grader with a modem will be able to send codes the NSA can\u0027t break. Our intelligence will be shot.\"\n But Susan\u0027s thoughts were far removed from the political implications of Digital Fortress. She was still struggling to comprehend its existence. She\u0027d spent her life breaking codes, firmly denying the existence of the ultimate code. Every code is breakable-the Bergofsky Principle! She felt like an atheist coming face to face with God.\n \"If this code gets out,\" she whispered, \"cryptography will become a dead science.\"\n Strathmore nodded. \"That\u0027s the least of our problems.\"\n \"Can we pay Tankado off? I know he hates us, but can\u0027t we offer him a few million dollars? Convince him not to distribute?\"\n Strathmore laughed. \"A few million? Do you know what this thing is worth? Every government in the world will bid top dollar. Can you imagine telling the President that we\u0027re still cable-snooping the Iraqis but we can\u0027t read the intercepts anymore? This isn\u0027t just about the NSA, it\u0027s about the entire intelligence community. This facility provides support for everyone-the FBI, CIA, DEA; they\u0027d all be flying blind. The drug cartels\u0027 shipments would become untraceable, major corporations could transfer money with no paper trail and leave the IRS out in the cold, terrorists could chat in total secrecy-it would be chaos.\"\n \"The EFF will have field day,\" Susan said, pale.\n \"The EFF doesn\u0027t have the first clue about what we do here,\" Strathmore railed in disgust. \"If they knew how many terrorist attacks we\u0027ve stopped because we can decrypt codes, they\u0027d change their tune.\"\n Susan agreed, but she also knew the realities; the EFF would never know how important TRANSLTR was. TRANSLTR had helped foil dozens of attacks, but the information was highly classified and would never be released. The rationale behind the secrecy was simple: The government could not afford the mass hysteria caused by revealing the truth; no one knew how the public would react to the news that there had been two nuclear close calls by fundamentalist groups on U.S. soil in the last year.\n Nuclear attack, however, was not the only threat. Only last month TRANSLTR had thwarted one of the most ingeniously conceived terrorist attacks the NSA had ever witnessed. An anti-government organization had devised a plan, code-named Sherwood Forest. It targeted the New York Stock Exchange with the intention of \"redistributing the wealth.\" Over the course of six days, members of the group placed twenty-seven nonexplosive flux pods in the buildings surrounding the Exchange. These devices, when detonated, create a powerful blast of magnetism. The simultaneous discharge of these carefully placed pods would create a magnetic field so powerful that all magnetic media in the Stock Exchange would be erased-computer hard drives, massive ROM storage banks, tape backups, and even floppy disks. All records of who owned what would disintegrate permanently.\n Because pinpoint timing was necessary for simultaneous detonation of the devices, the flux pods were interconnected over Internet telephone lines. During the two-day countdown, the pods\u0027 internal clocks exchanged endless streams of encrypted synchronization data. The NSA intercepted the data-pulses as a network anomaly but ignored them as a seemingly harmless exchange of gibberish. But after TRANSLTR decrypted the data streams, analysts immediately recognized the sequence as a network-synchronized countdown. The pods were located and removed a full three hours before they were scheduled to go off.\n Susan knew that without TRANSLTR the NSA was helpless against advanced electronic terrorism. She eyed the Run-Monitor. It still read over fifteen hours. Even if Tankado\u0027s file broke right now, the NSA was sunk. Crypto would be relegated to breaking less than two codes a day. Even at the present rate of 150 a day, there was still a backlog of files awaiting decryption.\n \"Tankado called me last month,\" Strathmore said, interrupting Susan\u0027s thoughts.\n Susan looked up. \"Tankado called you?\"\n He nodded. \"To warn me.\"\n \"Warn you? He hates you.\"\n \"He called to tell me he was perfecting an algorithm that wrote unbreakable codes. I didn\u0027t believe him.\"\n \"But why would he tell you about it?\" Susan demanded. \"Did he want you to buy it?\"\n \"No. It was blackmail.\"\n Things suddenly began falling into place for Susan. \"Of course,\" she said, amazed. \"He wanted you to clear his name.\"\n \"No,\" Strathmore frowned. \"Tankado wanted TRANSLTR.\"\n \"TRANSLTR?\"\n \"Yes. He ordered me to go public and tell the world we have TRANSLTR. He said if we admitted we can read public E-mail, he would destroy Digital Fortress.\"\n Susan looked doubtful.\n Strathmore shrugged. \"Either way, it\u0027s too late now. He\u0027s posted a complimentary copy of Digital Fortress at his Internet site. Everyone in the world can download it.\"\n Susan went white. \"He what!\"\n \"It\u0027s a publicity stunt. Nothing to worry about. The copy he posted is encrypted. People can download it, but nobody can open it. It\u0027s ingenious, really. The source code for Digital Fortress has been encrypted, locked shut.\"\n Susan looked amazed. \"Of course! So everybody can have a copy, but nobody can open it.\"\n \"Exactly. Tankado\u0027s dangling a carrot.\"\n \"Have you seen the algorithm?\"\n The commander looked puzzled. \"No, I told you it\u0027s encrypted.\"\n Susan looked equally puzzled. \"But we\u0027ve got TRANSLTR; why not just decrypt it?\" But when Susan saw Strathmore\u0027s face, she realized the rules had changed. \"Oh my God.\" She gasped, suddenly understanding. \"Digital Fortress is encrypted with itself?\"\n Strathmore nodded. \"Bingo.\"\n Susan was amazed. The formula for Digital Fortress had been encrypted using Digital Fortress. Tankado had posted a priceless mathematical recipe, but the text of the recipe had been scrambled. And it had used itself to do the scrambling.\n \"It\u0027s Biggleman\u0027s Safe,\" Susan stammered in awe.\n Strathmore nodded. Biggleman\u0027s Safe was a hypothetical cryptography scenario in which a safe builder wrote blueprints for an unbreakable safe. He wanted to keep the blueprints a secret, so he built the safe and locked the blueprints inside. Tankado had done the same thing with Digital Fortress. He\u0027d protected his blueprints by encrypting them with the formula outlined in his blueprints.\n \"And the file in TRANSLTR?\" Susan asked.\n \"I downloaded it from Tankado\u0027s Internet site like everyone else. The NSA is now the proud owner of the Digital Fortress algorithm; we just can\u0027t open it.\"\n Susan marveled at Ensei Tankado\u0027s ingenuity. Without revealing his algorithm, he had proven to the NSA that it was unbreakable.\n Strathmore handed her a newspaper clipping. It was a translated blurb from the Nikkei Shimbun, the Japanese equivalent of the Wall Street Journal, stating that the Japanese programmer Ensei Tankado had completed a mathematical formula he claimed could write unbreakable codes. The formula was called Digital Fortress and was available for review on the Internet. The programmer would be auctioning it off to the highest bidder. The column went on to say that although there was enormous interest in Japan, the few U.S. software companies who had heard about Digital Fortress deemed the claim preposterous, akin to turning lead to gold. The formula, they said, was a hoax and not to be taken seriously.\n Susan looked up. \"An auction?\"\n Strathmore nodded. \"Right now every software company in Japan has downloaded an encrypted copy of Digital Fortress and is trying to crack it open. Every second they can\u0027t, the bidding price climbs.\"\n \"That\u0027s absurd,\" Susan shot back. \"All the new encrypted files are uncrackable unless you have TRANSLTR. Digital Fortress could be nothing more than a generic, public-domain algorithm, and none of these companies could break it.\"\n \"But it\u0027s a brilliant marketing ploy,\" Strathmore said. \"Think about it-all brands of bulletproof glass stop bullets, but if a company dares you to put a bullet through theirs, suddenly everybody\u0027s trying.\"\n \"And the Japanese actually believe Digital Fortress is different? Better than everything else on the market?\"\n \"Tankado may have been shunned, but everybody knows he\u0027s a genius. He\u0027s practically a cult icon among hackers. If Tankado says the algorithm\u0027s unbreakable, it\u0027s unbreakable.\"\n But they\u0027re all unbreakable as far as the public knows!\"\n \"Yes...\" Strathmore mused. \"For the moment.\"\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\n Strathmore sighed. \"Twenty years ago no one imagined we\u0027d be breaking twelve-bit stream ciphers. But technology progressed. It always does. Software manufacturers assume at some point computers like TRANSLTR will exist. Technology is progressing exponentially, and eventually current public-key algorithms will lose their security. Better algorithms will be needed to stay ahead of tomorrow\u0027s computers.\"\n \"And Digital Fortress is it?\"\n \"Exactly. An algorithm that resists brute force will never become obsolete, no matter how powerful code-breaking computers get. It could become a world standard overnight.\"\n Susan pulled in a long breath. \"God help us,\" she whispered. \"Can we make a bid?\"\n Strathmore shook his head. \"Tankado gave us our chance. He made that clear. It\u0027s too risky anyway; if we get caught, we\u0027re basically admitting that we\u0027re afraid of his algorithm. We\u0027d be making a public confession not only that we have TRANSLTR but that Digital Fortress is immune.\"\n \"What\u0027s the time frame?\"\n Strathmore frowned. \"Tankado planned to announce the highest bidder tomorrow at noon.\"\n Susan felt her stomach tighten. \"Then what?\"\n \"The arrangement was that he would give the winner the pass-key.\"\n \"The pass-key?\"\n \"Part of the ploy. Everybody\u0027s already got the algorithm, so Tankado\u0027s auctioning off the pass-key that unlocks it.\"\n Susan groaned. \"Of course.\" It was perfect. Clean and simple. Tankado had encrypted Digital Fortress, and he alone held the pass-key that unlocked it. She found it hard to fathom that somewhere out there-probably scrawled on a piece of paper in Tankado\u0027s pocket-there was a sixty-four-character pass-key that could end U.S. intelligence gathering forever.\n Susan suddenly felt ill as she imagined the scenario. Tankado would give his pass-key to the highest bidder, and that company would unlock the Digital Fortress file. Then it probably would embed the algorithm in a tamper-proof chip, and within five years every computer would come preloaded with a Digital Fortress chip. No commercial manufacturer had ever dreamed of creating an encryption chip because normal encryption algorithms eventually become obsolete. But Digital Fortress would never become obsolete; with a rotating cleartext function, no brute-force attack would ever find the right key. A new digital encryption standard. From now until forever. Every code unbreakable. Bankers, brokers, terrorists, spies. One world-one algorithm.\n Anarchy.\n \"What are the options?\" Susan probed. She was well aware that desperate times called for desperate measures, even at the NSA.\n \"We can\u0027t remove him, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re asking.\"\n It was exactly what Susan was asking. In her years with the NSA, Susan had heard rumors of its loose affiliations with the most skilled assassins in the world-hired hands brought in to do the intelligence community\u0027s dirty work.\n Strathmore shook his head. \"Tankado\u0027s too smart to leave us an option like that.\"\n Susan felt oddly relieved. \"He\u0027s protected?\"\n \"Not exactly.\"\n \"In hiding?\"\n Strathmore shrugged. \"Tankado left Japan. He planned to check his bids by phone. But we know where he is.\"\n \"And you don\u0027t plan to make a move?\"\n \"No. He\u0027s got insurance. Tankado gave a copy of his pass-key to an anonymous third party... in case anything happened.\"\n Of course, Susan marveled. A guardian angel. \"And I suppose if anything happens to Tankado, the mystery man sells the key?\"\n \"Worse. Anyone hits Tankado, and his partner publishes.\"\n Susan looked confused. \"His partner publishes the key?\"\n Strathmore nodded. \"Posts it on the Internet, puts it in newspapers, on billboards. In effect, he gives it away.\"\n Susan\u0027s eyes widened. \"Free downloads?\"\n \"Exactly. Tankado figured if he was dead, he wouldn\u0027t need the money-why not give the world a little farewell gift?\"\n There was a long silence. Susan breathed deeply as if to absorb the terrifying truth. Ensei Tankado has created an unbreakable algorithm. He\u0027s holding us hostage.\n She suddenly stood. Her voice was determined. \"We must contact Tankado! There must be a way to convince him not to release! We can offer him triple the highest bid! We can clear his name! Anything!\"\n \"Too late,\" Strathmore said. He took a deep breath. \"Ensei Tankado was found dead this morning in Seville, Spain.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-8.html","bookId":2226,"book":{"id":2226,"title":"Digital Fortress","description":"Storyline: \n When the NSA\u0027s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician.
