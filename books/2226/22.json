I trust you have both pass-keys.\" \"There will be a small delay,\" the American answered. \"Unacceptable,\" Numataka hissed. \"You said I would have them by the end of today!\" \"There is one loose end.\" \"Is Tankado dead?\" \"Yes,\" the voice said. \"My man killed Mr. Tankado, but he failed to get the pass-key.

Finally Numataka spoke. \"Where is the key now?\" \"All you need to know is that it will be found.\" \"How can you be so certain?\" \"Because I am not the only one looking for it. American Intelligence has caught wind of the missing key. For obvious reasons they would like to prevent the release of Digital Fortress. They have sent a man to locate the key. His name is David Becker.\" \"How do you know this?\" \"That is irrelevant.\" Numataka paused. \"And if Mr. Becker locates the key?\" \"My man will take it from him.\" \"And after that?\" \"You needn\u0027t be concerned,\" the American said coldly. \"When Mr. Becker finds the key, he will be properly rewarded.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-22.html","bookId":2226,"book":{"id":2226,"title":"Digital Fortress","description":"Storyline: When the NSA\u0027s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician.
