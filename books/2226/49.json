Said it was breaking codes every six minutes even as we speak. Thanked me for checking up on him.\"\n \"He\u0027s lying,\" Midge snapped. \"I\u0027ve been running these Crypto stats for two years. The data is never wrong.\"\n \"First time for everything,\" he said casually.\n She shot him a disapproving look. \"I run all data twice.\"\n \"Well... you know what they say about computers. When they screw up, at least they\u0027re consistent about it.\"\n Midge spun and faced him. \"This isn\u0027t funny, Chad! The DDO just told a blatant lie to the director\u0027s office. I want to know why!\"\n Brinkerhoff suddenly wished he hadn\u0027t called her back in. Strathmore\u0027s phone call had set her off. Ever since Skipjack, whenever Midge had a sense that something suspicious was going on, she made an eerie transition from flirt to fiend. There was no stopping her until she sorted it out.\n \"Midge, it is possible our data is off,\" Brinkerhoff said firmly. \"I mean, think about it-a file that ties up TRANSLTR for eighteen hours? It\u0027s unheard of. Go home. It\u0027s late.\"\n She gave him a haughty look and tossed the report on the counter. \"I trust the data. Instinct says it\u0027s right.\"\n Brinkerhoff frowned. Not even the director questioned Midge Milken\u0027s instincts anymore-she had an uncanny habit of always being right.\n \"Something\u0027s up,\" she declared. \"And I intend to find out what it is.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-49.html","bookId":2226,"book":{"id":2226,"title":"Digital Fortress","description":"Storyline: \n When the NSA\u0027s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician.
