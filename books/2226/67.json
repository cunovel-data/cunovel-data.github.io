The attackers surged forward, only a whisker away from their assault on the fifth and final wall. The databank was running out of time.\\n\\n Susan blocked out the chaos around her. She read Tankado\u0027s bizarre message over and over.\\n\\n PRIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ELEMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not even a question!\" Brinkerhoff cried. \"How can it have an answer?\"\\n\\n \"We need a number,\" Jabba reminded. \"The kill-code is numeric.\"\\n\\n \"Silence,\" Fontaine said evenly. He turned and addressed Susan. \"Ms. Fletcher, you\u0027ve gotten us this far. I need your best guess.\"\\n\\n Susan took a deep breath. \"The kill-code entry field accepts numerics only. My guess is that this is some sort of clue as to the correct number. The text mentions Hiroshima and Nagasaki-the two cities that were hit by atomic bombs. Maybe the kill-code is related to the number of casualties, the estimated dollars of damage...\" She paused a moment, rereading the clue. \"The word \u0027difference\u0027 seems important. The prime difference between Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Apparently Tankado felt the two incidents differed somehow.\"\\n\\n Fontaine\u0027s expression did not change. Nonetheless, hope was fading fast. It seemed the political backdrops surrounding the two most devastating blasts in history needed to be analyzed, compared, and translated into some magic number... and all within the next five minutes.\\n\\n Chapter 124\\n\\n \"Final shield under attack!\"\\n\\n On the VR, the PEM authorization programming was now being consumed. Black, penetrating lines engulfed the final protective shield and began forcing their way toward its core.\\n\\n Prowling hackers were now appearing from all over the world. The number was doubling almost every minute. Before long, anyone with a computer-foreign spies, radicals, terrorists-would have access to all of the U.S. government\u0027s classified information.\\n\\n As technicians tried vainly to sever power, the assembly on the podium studied the message. Even David and the two NSA agents were trying to crack the code from their van in Spain.\\n\\n PRIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ELEMENTS RESPONSIBLE FORHIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI\\n\\n Soshi thought aloud. \"The elements responsible for Hiroshima and Nagasaki... Pearl Harbor? Hirohito\u0027s refusal to...\"\\n\\n \"We need a number,\" Jabba repeated, \"not political theories. We\u0027re talking mathematics-not history!\"\\n\\n Soshi fell silent.\\n\\n \"How about payloads?\" Brinkerhoff offered. \"Casualties? Dollars damage?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re looking for an exact figure,\" Susan reminded. \"Damage estimates vary.\" She stared up at the message. \"The elements responsible...\"\\n\\n Three thousand miles away, David Becker\u0027s eyes flew open. \"Elements!\" he declared. \"We\u0027re talking math, not history!\"\\n\\n All heads turned toward the satellite screen.\\n\\n \"Tankado\u0027s playing word games!\" Becker spouted. \"The word \u0027elements\u0027 has multiple meanings!\"\\n\\n \"Spit it out, Mr. Becker,\" Fontaine snapped.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s talking about chemical elements-not sociopolitical ones!\"\\n\\n Becker\u0027s announcement met blank looks.\\n\\n \"Elements!\" he prompted. \"The periodic table! Chemical elements! Didn\u0027t any of you see the movie Fat Man and Little Boy-about the Manhattan Project? The two atomic bombs were different. They used different fuel-different elements!\"\\n\\n Soshi clapped her hands. \"Yes! He\u0027s right! I read that! The two bombs used different fuels! One used uranium and one used plutonium! Two different elements!\"\\n\\n A hush swept across the room.\\n\\n \"Uranium and plutonium!\" Jabba exclaimed, suddenly hopeful. \"The clue asks for the difference between the two elements!\" He spun to his army of workers. \"The difference between uranium and plutonium! Who knows what it is?\"\\n\\n Blank stares all around.\\n\\n \"Come on!\" Jabba said. \"Didn\u0027t you kids go to college? Somebody! Anybody! I need the difference between plutonium and uranium!\"\\n\\n No response.\\n\\n Susan turned to Soshi. \"I need access to the Web. Is there a browser here?\"\\n\\n Soshi nodded. \"Netscape\u0027s sweetest.\"\\n\\n Susan grabbed her hand. \"Come on. We\u0027re going surfing.\"\\n\\n Chapter 125\\n\\n \"How much time?\" Jabba demanded from the podium.\\n\\n There was no response from the technicians in the back. They stood riveted, staring up at the VR. The final shield was getting dangerously thin.\\n\\n Nearby, Susan and Soshi pored over the results of their Web search. \"Outlaw Labs?\" Susan asked. \"Who are they?\"\\n\\n Soshi shrugged. \"You want me to open it?\"\\n\\n \"Damn right,\" she said. \"Six hundred forty-seven text references to uranium, plutonium, and atomic bombs. Sounds like our best bet.\"\\n\\n Soshi opened the link. A disclaimer appeared.\\n\\n The information contained in this file is strictly for academic use only. Any layperson attempting to construct any of the devices described runs the risk of radiation poisoning and/or self-explosion.\\n\\n \"Self-explosion?\" Soshi said. \"Jesus.\"\\n\\n \"Search it,\" Fontaine snapped over his shoulder. \"Let\u0027s see what we\u0027ve got.\"\\n\\n Soshi plowed into the document. She scrolled past a recipe for urea nitrate, an explosive ten times more powerful than dynamite. The information rolled by like a recipe for butterscotch brownies.\\n\\n \"Plutonium and uranium,\" Jabba repeated. \"Let\u0027s focus.\"\\n\\n \"Go back,\" Susan ordered. \"The document\u0027s too big. Find the table of contents.\"\\n\\n Soshi scrolled backward until she found it.\\n\\n I. Mechanism of an Atomic Bomb\\n\\n A) Altimeter\\n\\n B) Air Pressure Detonator\\n\\n C) Detonating Heads\\n\\n D) Explosive Charges\\n\\n E) Neutron Deflector\\n\\n F) Uranium Plutonium\\n\\n G) Lead Shield\\n\\n H) Fuses\\n\\n II. Nuclear Fission/Nuclear Fusion\\n\\n A) Fission (A-Bomb) Fusion (H-Bomb)\\n\\n B) U-235, U-238, and Plutonium\\n\\n III. History of the Atomic Weapons\\n\\n A) Development (The Manhattan Project)\\n\\n B) Detonation 1) Hiroshima 2) Nagasaki 3) By-products of Atomic Detonations 4) Blast Zones \"Section two!\" Susan cried. \"Uranium and plutonium! Go!\"\\n\\n Everyone waited while Soshi found the right section. \"This is it,\" she said. \"Hold on.\" She quickly scanned the data. \"There\u0027s a lot of information here. A whole chart. How do we know which difference we\u0027re looking for? One occurs naturally, one is man-made. Plutonium was first discovered by-\"\\n\\n \"A number,\" Jabba reminded. \"We need a number.\"\\n\\n Susan reread Tankado\u0027s message. The prime difference between the elements... the difference between... we need a number... \"Wait!\" she said. \"The word \u0027difference\u0027 has multiple meanings. We need a number-so we\u0027re talking math. It\u0027s another of Tankado\u0027s word games-\u0027difference\u0027 means subtraction.\"\\n\\n \"Yes!\" Becker agreed from the screen overhead. \"Maybe the elements have different numbers of protons or something? If you subtract-\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s right!\" Jabba said, turning to Soshi. \"Are there any numbers on that chart? Proton counts? Half-lives? Anything we can subtract?\"\\n\\n \"Three minutes!\" a technician called.\\n\\n \"How about supercritical mass?\" Soshi ventured. \"It says the supercritical mass for plutonium is 35.2 pounds.\"\\n\\n \"Yes!\" Jabba said. \"Check uranium! What\u0027s the supercritical mass of uranium?\"\\n\\n Soshi searched. \"Um... 110 pounds.\"\\n\\n \"One hundred ten?\" Jabba looked suddenly hopeful. \"What\u0027s 35.2 from 110?\"\\n\\n \"Seventy-four point eight,\" Susan snapped. \"But I don\u0027t think-\"\\n\\n \"Out of my way,\" Jabba commanded, plowing toward the keyboard. \"That\u0027s got to be the kill-code! The difference between their critical masses! Seventy-four point eight!\"\\n\\n \"Hold on,\" Susan said, peering over Soshi\u0027s shoulder. \"There\u0027s more here. Atomic weights. Neutron counts. Extraction techniques.\" She skimmed the chart. \"Uranium splits into barium and krypton; plutonium does something else. Uranium has 92 protons and 146 neutrons, but-\"\\n\\n \"We need the most obvious difference,\" Midge chimed in. \"The clue reads \u0027the primary difference between the elements.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Jesus Christ!\" Jabba swore. \"How do we know what Tankado considered the primary difference?\"\\n\\n David interrupted. \"Actually, the clue reads prime, not primary.\"\\n\\n The word hit Susan right between the eyes. \"Prime!\" she exclaimed. \"Prime!\" She spun to Jabba. \"The kill-code is a prime number! Think about it! It makes perfect sense!\"\\n\\n Jabba instantly knew Susan was right. Ensei Tankado had built his career on prime numbers. Primes were the fundamental building blocks of all encryption algorithms-unique values that had no factors other than one and themselves. Primes worked well in code writing because they were impossible for computers to guess using typical number-tree factoring.\\n\\n Soshi jumped in. \"Yes! It\u0027s perfect! Primes are essential to Japanese culture! Haiku uses primes. Three lines and syllable counts of five, seven, five. All primes. The temples of Kyoto all have-\"\\n\\n \"Enough!\" Jabba said. \"Even if the kill-code is a prime, so what! There are endless possibilities!\"\\n\\n Susan knew Jabba was right. Because the number line was infinite, one could always look a little farther and find another prime number. Between zero and a million, there were over 70,000 choices. It all depended on how large a prime Tankado decided to use. The bigger it was, the harder it was to guess.\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll be huge.\" Jabba groaned. \"Whatever prime Tankado chose is sure to be a monster.\"\\n\\n A call went up from the rear of the room. \"Two-minute warning!\"\\n\\n Jabba gazed up at the VR in defeat. The final shield was starting to crumble. Technicians were rushing everywhere.\\n\\n Something in Susan told her they were close. \"We can do this!\" she declared, taking control. \"Of all the differences between uranium and plutonium, I bet only one can be represented as a prime number! That\u0027s our final clue. The number we\u0027re looking for is prime!\"\\n\\n Jabba eyed the uranium/plutonium chart on the monitor and threw up his arms. \"There must be a hundred entries here! There\u0027s no way we can subtract them all and check for primes.\"\\n\\n \"A lot of the entries are nonnumeric,\" Susan encouraged. \"We can ignore them. Uranium\u0027s natural, plutonium\u0027s man-made. Uranium uses a gun barrel detonator, plutonium uses implosion. They\u0027re not numbers, so they\u0027re irrelevant!\"\\n\\n \"Do it,\" Fontaine ordered. On the VR, the final wall was eggshell thin.\\n\\n Jabba mopped his brow. \"All right, here goes nothing. Start subtracting. I\u0027ll take the top quarter. Susan, you\u0027ve got the middle. Everybody else split up the rest. We\u0027re looking for a prime difference.\"\\n\\n Within seconds, it was clear they\u0027d never make it. The numbers were enormous, and in many cases the units didn\u0027t match up.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s apples and goddamn oranges,\" Jabba said. \"We\u0027ve got gamma rays against electromagnetic pulse. Fissionable against unfissionable. Some is pure. Some is percentage. It\u0027s a mess!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s got to be here,\" Susan said firmly. \"We\u0027ve got to think. There\u0027s some difference between plutonium and uranium that we\u0027re missing! Something simple!\"\\n\\n \"Ah... guys?\" Soshi said. She\u0027d created a second document window and was perusing the rest of the Outlaw Labs document.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Fontaine demanded. \"Find something?\"\\n\\n \"Um, sort of.\" She sounded uneasy. \"You know how I told you the Nagasaki bomb was a plutonium bomb?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" they all replied in unison.\\n\\n \"Well...\" Soshi took a deep breath. \"Looks like I made a mistake.\"\\n\\n \"What!\" Jabba choked. \"We\u0027ve been looking for the wrong thing?\"\\n\\n Soshi pointed to the screen. They huddled around and read the text: ...the common misconception that the Nagasaki bomb was a plutonium bomb. In fact, the device employed uranium, like its sister bomb in Hiroshima.\\n\\n \"But-\" Susan gasped. \"If both elements were uranium, how are we supposed to find the difference between the two?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe Tankado made a mistake,\" Fontaine ventured. \"Maybe he didn\u0027t know the bombs were the same.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Susan sighed. \"He was a cripple because of those bombs. He\u0027d know the facts cold.\"\\n\\n Chapter 126\\n\\n \"One minute!\"\\n\\n Jabba eyed the VR. \"PEM authorization\u0027s going fast. Last line of defense. And there\u0027s a crowd at the door.\"\\n\\n \"Focus!\" Fontaine commanded.\\n\\n Soshi sat in front of the Web browser and read aloud. ...Nagasaki bomb did not use plutonium but rather an artificially manufactured, neutron-saturated isotope of uranium 238.\"\\n\\n \"Damn!\" Brinkerhoff swore. \"Both bombs used uranium. The elements responsible for Hiroshima and Nagasaki were both uranium. There is no difference!\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re dead,\" Midge moaned.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Susan said. \"Read that last part again!\"\\n\\n Soshi repeated the text. \"...artificially manufactured, neutron-saturated isotope of uranium 238.\"\\n\\n \"238?\" Susan exclaimed. \"Didn\u0027t we just see something that said Hiroshima\u0027s bomb used some other isotope of uranium?\"\\n\\n They all exchanged puzzled glances. Soshi frantically scrolled backward and found the spot. \"Yes! It says here that the Hiroshima bomb used a different isotope of uranium!\"\\n\\n Midge gasped in amazement. \"They\u0027re both uranium-but they\u0027re different kinds!\"\\n\\n \"Both uranium?\" Jabba muscled in and stared at the terminal. \"Apples and apples! Perfect!\"\\n\\n \"How are the two isotopes different?\" Fontaine demanded. \"It\u0027s got to be something basic.\"\\n\\n Soshi scrolled through the document. \"Hold on... looking... okay...\"\\n\\n \"Forty-five seconds!\" a voice called out.\\n\\n Susan looked up. The final shield was almost invisible now.\\n\\n \"Here it is!\" Soshi exclaimed.\\n\\n \"Read it!\" Jabba was sweating. \"What\u0027s the difference! There must be some difference between the two!\"\\n\\n \"Yes!\" Soshi pointed to her monitor. \"Look!\"\\n\\n They all read the text: ...two bombs employed two different fuels... precisely identical chemical characteristics. No ordinary chemical extraction can separate the two isotopes. They are, with the exception of minute differences in weight, perfectly identical.\\n\\n \"Atomic weight!\" Jabba said, excitedly. \"That\u0027s it! The only difference is their weights! That\u0027s the key! Give me their weights! We\u0027ll subtract them!\"\\n\\n \"Hold on,\" Soshi said, scrolling ahead. \"Almost there! Yes!\" Everyone scanned the text. ...difference in weight very slight... ...gaseous diffusion to separate them... ...10,032498X10?134 as compared to 19,39484X10?23.** \"There they are!\" Jabba screamed. \"That\u0027s it! Those are the weights!\"\\n\\n \"Thirty seconds!\"\\n\\n \"Go,\" Fontaine whispered. \"Subtract them. Quickly.\"\\n\\n Jabba palmed his calculator and started entering numbers.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the asterisk?\" Susan demanded. \"There\u0027s an asterisk after the figures!\"\\n\\n Jabba ignored her. He was already working his calculator keys furiously.\\n\\n \"Careful!\" Soshi urged. \"We need an exact figure.\"\\n\\n \"The asterisk,\" Susan repeated. \"There\u0027s a footnote.\"\\n\\n Soshi clicked to the bottom of the paragraph.\\n\\n Susan read the asterisked footnote. She went white. \"Oh... dear God.\"\\n\\n Jabba looked up. \"What?\"\\n\\n They all leaned in, and there was a communal sigh of defeat. The tiny footnote read: **12% margin of error. Published figures vary from lab to lab. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-67.html","bookId":2226,"book":{"id":2226,"title":"Digital Fortress","description":"Storyline: When the NSA\u0027s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician.
