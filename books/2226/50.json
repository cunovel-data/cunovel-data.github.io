Becker squinted in the stark lighting. It was the kid he\u0027d chased onto the bus. He glumly surveyed the sea of red, white, and blue coiffures.\n \"What\u0027s with the hair?\" Becker moaned, motioning to the others. \"It\u0027s all...\"\n \"Red, white, and blue?\" the kid offered.\n Becker nodded, trying not to stare at the infected perforation in the kid\u0027s upper lip.\n \"Judas Taboo,\" the kid said matter-of-factly.\n Becker looked bewildered.\n The punk spit in the aisle, obviously disgusted with Becker\u0027s ignorance. \"Judas Taboo? Greatest punk since Sid Vicious? Blew his head off here a year ago today. It\u0027s his anniversary.\"\n Becker nodded vaguely, obviously missing the connection.\n \"Taboo did his hair this way the day he signed off.\" The kid spit again. \"Every fan worth his weight in piss has got red, white, and blue hair today.\"\n For a long moment, Becker said nothing. Slowly, as if he had been shot with a tranquilizer, he turned and faced front. Becker surveyed the group on the bus. Every last one was a punk. Most were staring at him.\n Every fan has red, white, and blue hair today.\n Becker reached up and pulled the driver-alert cord on the wall. It was time to get off. He pulled again. Nothing happened. He pulled a third time, more frantically. Nothing.\n \"They disconnect \u0027em on bus 27.\" The kid spat again. \"So we don\u0027t fuck with \u0027em.\"\n Becker turned. \"You mean, I can\u0027t get off?\"\n The kid laughed. \"Not till the end of the line.\"\n Five minutes later, the bus was barreling along an unlit Spanish country road. Becker turned to the kid behind him. \"Is this thing ever going to stop?\"\n The kid nodded. \"Few more miles.\"\n \"Where are we going?\"\n He broke into a sudden wide grin. \"You mean you don\u0027t know?\"\n Becker shrugged.\n The kid started laughing hysterically. \"Oh, shit. You\u0027re gonna love it.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-50.html","bookId":2226,"book":{"id":2226,"title":"Digital Fortress","description":"Storyline: \n When the NSA\u0027s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician.
