That\u0027s why I sent David. I wanted to keep it that way. Curious spooks don\u0027t usually tail Spanish teachers.\"\n \"He\u0027s a professor,\" Susan corrected, immediately regretting the clarification. Every now and again Susan got the feeling David wasn\u0027t good enough for the commander, that he thought somehow she could do better than a schoolteacher.\n \"Commander,\" she said, moving on, \"if you briefed David by car phone this morning, someone could have intercepted the-\"\n \"One-in-a-million shot,\" Strathmore interrupted, his tone reassuring. \"Any eavesdropper had to be in the immediate vicinity and know exactly what to listen for.\" He put his hand on her shoulder. \"I would never have sent David if I thought it was dangerous.\" He smiled. \"Trust me. Any sign of trouble, and I\u0027ll send in the pros.\"\n Strathmore\u0027s words were punctuated by the sudden sound of someone pounding on the Node 3 glass. Susan and Strathmore turned.\n Sys-Sec Phil Chartrukian had his face pressed against the pane and was pounding fiercely, straining to see through. Whatever he was excitedly mouthing was not audible through the soundproofed glass. He looked like he\u0027d seen a ghost.\n \"What the hell is Chartrukian doing here?\" Strathmore growled. \"He\u0027s not on duty today.\"\n \"Looks like trouble,\" Susan said. \"He probably saw the Run-Monitor.\"\n \"Goddamn it!\" the commander hissed. \"I specifically called the scheduled Sys-Sec last night and told him not to come in!\"\n Susan was not surprised. Canceling a Sys-Sec duty was irregular, but Strathmore undoubtedly had wanted privacy in the dome. The last thing he needed was some paranoid Sys-Sec blowing the lid off Digital Fortress.\n \"We better abort TRANSLTR,\" Susan said. \"We can reset the Run-Monitor and tell Phil he was seeing things.\"\n Strathmore appeared to consider it, then shook his head. \"Not yet. TRANSLTR is fifteen hours into this attack. I want to run it a full twenty-four-just to be sure.\"\n This made sense to Susan. Digital Fortress was the first ever use of a rotating cleartext function. Maybe Tankado had overlooked something; maybe TRANSLTR would break it after twenty-four hours. Somehow Susan doubted it.\n \"TRANSLTR keeps running,\" Strathmore resolved. \"I need to know for sure this algorithm is untouchable.\"\n Chartrukian continued pounding on the pane.\n \"Here goes nothing.\" Strathmore groaned. \"Back me up.\"\n The commander took a deep breath and then strode to the sliding glass doors. The pressure plate on the floor activated, and the doors hissed open.\n Chartrukian practically fell into the room. \"Commander, sir. I... I\u0027m sorry to bother you, but the Run-Monitor... I ran a virus probe and-\"\n \"Phil, Phil, Phil,\" the commander gushed pleasantly as he put a reassuring hand on Chartrukian\u0027s shoulder. \"Slow down. What seems to be the problem?\"\n From the easygoing tone in Strathmore\u0027s voice, nobody would ever have guessed his world was falling in around him. He stepped aside and ushered Chartrukian into the sacred walls of Node 3. The Sys-Sec stepped over the threshold hesitantly, like a well-trained dog that knew better.\n From the puzzled look on Chartrukian\u0027s face, it was obvious he\u0027d never seen the inside of this place. Whatever had been the source of his panic was momentarily forgotten. He surveyed the plush interior, the line of private terminals, the couches, the bookshelves, the soft lighting. When his gaze fell on the reigning queen of Crypto, Susan Fletcher, he quickly looked away. Susan intimidated the hell out of him. Her mind worked on a different plane. She was unsettlingly beautiful, and his words always seemed to get jumbled around her. Susan\u0027s unassuming air made it even worse.\n \"What seems to be the problem, Phil?\" Strathmore said, opening the refrigerator. \"Drink?\"\n \"No, ah-no, thank you, sir.\" He seemed tongue-tied, not sure he was truly welcome. \"Sir... I think there\u0027s a problem with TRANSLTR.\"\n Strathmore closed the refrigerator and looked at Chartrukian casually. \"You mean the Run-Monitor?\"\n Chartrukian looked shocked. \"You mean you\u0027ve seen it?\"\n \"Sure. It\u0027s running at about sixteen hours, if I\u0027m not mistaken.\"\n Chartrukian seemed puzzled. \"Yes, sir, sixteen hours. But that\u0027s not all, sir. I ran a virus probe, and it\u0027s turning up some pretty strange stuff.\"\n \"Really?\" Strathmore seemed unconcerned. \"What kind of stuff?\"\n Susan watched, impressed with the commander\u0027s performance.\n Chartrukian stumbled on. \"TRANSLTR\u0027s processing something very advanced. The filters have never seen anything like it. I\u0027m afraid TRANSLTR may have some sort of virus.\"\n \"A virus?\" Strathmore chuckled with just a hint of condescension. \"Phil, I appreciate your concern, I really do. But Ms. Fletcher and I are running a new diagnostic, some very advanced stuff. I would have alerted you to it, but I wasn\u0027t aware you were on duty today.\"\n The Sys-Sec did his best to cover gracefully. \"I switched with the new guy. I took his weekend shift.\"\n Strathmore\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"That\u0027s odd. I spoke to him last night. I told him not to come in. He said nothing about switching shifts.\"\n Chartrukian felt a knot rise in his throat. There was a tense silence.\n \"Well.\" Strathmore finally sighed. \"Sounds like an unfortunate mix-up.\" He put a hand on the Sys-Sec\u0027s shoulder and led him toward the door. \"The good news is you don\u0027t have to stay. Ms. Fletcher and I will be here all day. We\u0027ll hold the fort. You just enjoy your weekend.\"\n Chartrukian was hesitant. \"Commander, I really think we should check the-\"\n \"Phil,\" Strathmore repeated a little more sternly, \"TRANSLTR is fine. If your probe saw something strange, it\u0027s because we put it there. Now if you don\u0027t mind...\" Strathmore trailed off, and the Sys-Sec understood. His time was up.\n \"A diagnostic, my ass!\" Chartrukian muttered as he fumed back into the Sys-Sec lab. \"What kind of looping function keeps three million processors busy for sixteen hours?\"\n Chartrukian wondered if he should call the Sys-Sec supervisor. Goddamn cryptographers, he thought. They just don\u0027t understand security!\n The oath Chartrukian had taken when he joined Sys-Sec began running through his head. He had sworn to use his expertise, training, and instinct to protect the NSA\u0027s multibillion-dollar investment.\n \"Instinct,\" he said defiantly. It doesn\u0027t take a psychic to know this isn\u0027t any goddamn diagnostic!\n Defiantly, Chartrukian strode over to the terminal and fired up TRANSLTR\u0027s complete array of system assessment software.\n \"Your baby\u0027s in trouble, Commander,\" he grumbled. \"You don\u0027t trust instinct? I\u0027ll get you proof!\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-20.html","bookId":2226,"book":{"id":2226,"title":"Digital Fortress","description":"Storyline: \n When the NSA\u0027s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician.
