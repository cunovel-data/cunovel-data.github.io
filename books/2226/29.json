Having an officer fake a German accent and request a girl for the night-it was entrapment; what would they think of next?\n The phone on his desk buzzed loudly. Senor Roldan scooped up the receiver with a confident flair. \"Buenas noches, Escortes Belen.\"\n \"Buenas noches,\" a man\u0027s voice said in lightning-fast Spanish. He sounded nasal, like he had a slight cold. \"Is this a hotel?\"\n \"No, sir. What number are you dialing?\" Senor Roldan was not going to fall for any more tricks this evening.\n \"34-62-10,\" the voice said.\n Roldan frowned. The voice sounded vaguely familiar. He tried to place the accent-Burgos, maybe? \"You\u0027ve dialed the correct number,\" Roldan offered cautiously, \"but this is an escort service.\"\n There was a pause on the line. \"Oh... I see. I\u0027m sorry. Somebody wrote down this number; I thought it was a hotel. I\u0027m visiting here, from Burgos. My apologies for disturbing you. Good nigh-\"\n \"Espere! Wait!\" Senor Roldan couldn\u0027t help himself; he was a salesman at heart. Was this a referral? A new client from up north? He wasn\u0027t going to let a little paranoia blow a potential sale.\n \"My friend,\" Roldan gushed into the phone. \"I thought I recognized a bit of a Burgos accent on you. I myself am from Valencia. What brings you to Seville?\"\n \"I sell jewelry. Majorica pearls.\"\n \"Majoricas, reeaally! You must travel quite a bit.\"\n The voice coughed sickly. \"Well, yes, I do.\"\n \"In Seville on business?\" Roldan pressed. There was no way in hell this guy was Guardia; he was a customer with a capital C. \"Let me guess-a friend gave you our number? He told you to give us a call. Am I right?\"\n The voice was obviously embarrassed. \"Well, no, actually, it\u0027s nothing like that.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be shy, senor. We are an escort service, nothing to be ashamed of. Lovely girls, dinner dates, that is all. Who gave you our number? Perhaps he is a regular. I can give you a special rate.\"\n The voice became flustered. \"Ah... nobody actually gave me this number. I found it with a passport. I\u0027m trying to find the owner.\"\n Roldan\u0027s heart sank. This man was not a customer after all. \"You found the number, you say?\"\n \"Yes, I found a man\u0027s passport in the park today. Your number was on a scrap of paper inside. I thought perhaps it was the man\u0027s hotel; I was hoping to return his passport to him. My mistake. I\u0027ll just drop it off at a police station on my way out of-\"\n \"Perdon,\" Roldan interrupted nervously. \"Might I suggest a better idea?\" Roldan prided himself on discretion, and visits to the Guardia had a way of making his customers ex-customers. \"Consider this,\" he offered. \"Because the man with the passport had our number, he is most likely a client here. Perhaps I could save you a trip to the police.\"\n The voice hesitated. \"I don\u0027t know. I should probably just-\"\n \"Do not be too hasty, my friend. I\u0027m ashamed to admit that the police here in Seville are not always as efficient as the police up north. It could be days before this man\u0027s passport is returned to him. If you tell me his name, I could see that he gets his passport immediately.\"\n \"Yes, well... I suppose there\u0027s no harm...\" Some paper rustled, and the voice returned. \"It\u0027s a German name. I can\u0027t quite pronounce it... Gusta... Gustafson?\"\n Roldan didn\u0027t recognize the name, but he had clients from all over the world. They never left their real names. \"What does he look like-in his photo? Perhaps I will recognize him.\"\n \"Well...\" the voice said. \"His face is very, very fat.\"\n Roldan immediately knew. He remembered the obese face well. It was the man with Rocio. It was odd, he thought, to have two calls about the German in one night.\n \"Mr. Gustafson?\" Roldan forced a chuckle. \"Of course! I know him well. If you bring me his passport, I\u0027ll see he gets it.\"\n \"I\u0027m downtown without a car,\" the voice interrupted. \"Maybe you could come to me?\"\n \"Actually,\" Roldan hedged, \"I can\u0027t leave the phone. But it\u0027s really not that far if you-\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, it\u0027s late to be out wandering about. There\u0027s a Guardia precinct nearby. I\u0027ll drop it there, and when you see Mr. Gustafson, you can tell him where it is.\"\n \"No, wait!\" Roldan cried. \"The police really needn\u0027t be involved. You said you\u0027re downtown, right? Do you know the Alfonso XIII Hotel? It\u0027s one of the city\u0027s finest.\"\n \"Yes,\" the voice said. \"I know the Alfonso XIII. It\u0027s nearby.\"\n \"Wonderful! Mr. Gustafson is a guest there tonight. He\u0027s probably there now.\"\n The voice hesitated. \"I see. Well, then... I suppose it would be no trouble.\"\n \"Superb! He\u0027s having dinner with one of our escorts in the hotel restaurant.\" Roldan knew they were probably in bed by now, but he needed to be careful not to offend the caller\u0027s refined sensibilities. \"Just leave the passport with the concierge, his name is Manuel. Tell him I sent you. Ask him to give it to Rocio. Rocio is Mr. Gustafson\u0027s date for the evening. She will see that the passport is returned. You might slip your name and address inside-perhaps Mr. Gustafson will send you a little thank you.\"\n \"A fine idea. The Alfonso XIII. Very well, I\u0027ll take it over right now. Thank you for your help.\"\n David Becker hung up the phone. \"Alfonso XIII.\" He chuckled. \"Just have to know how to ask.\"\n Moments later a silent figure followed Becker up Calle Deliciasinto the softly settling Andalusian night. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-29.html","bookId":2226,"book":{"id":2226,"title":"Digital Fortress","description":"Storyline: \n When the NSA\u0027s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician.
