Don\u0027t remind me.\"\\n\\n Thirty seconds later, Midge was sitting in Brinkerhoff\u0027s chair and studying the Crypto report.\\n\\n \"See?\" he said, leaning over her and pointing to the figure in question. \"This MCD? A billion dollars!\"\\n\\n Midge chuckled. \"It does appear to be a touch on the high side, doesn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" He groaned. \"Just a touch.\"\\n\\n \"Looks like a divide-by-zero.\"\\n\\n \"A who?\"\\n\\n \"A divide-by-zero,\" she said, scanning the rest of the data. \"The MCD\u0027s calculated as a fraction-total expense divided by number of decryptions.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" Brinkerhoff nodded blankly and tried not to peer down the front of her dress.\\n\\n \"When the denominator\u0027s zero,\" Midge explained, \"the quotient goes to infinity. Computers hate infinity, so they type all nines.\" She pointed to a different column. \"See this?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Brinkerhoff refocused on the paper.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s today\u0027s raw production data. Take a look at the number of decryptions.\"\\n\\n Brinkerhoff dutifully followed her finger down the column.\\n\\n NUMBER OF DECRYPTIONS \u003d 0\\n\\n Midge tapped on the figure. \"It\u0027s just as I suspected. Divide-by-zero.\"\\n\\n Brinkerhoff arched his eyebrows. \"So everything\u0027s okay?\"\\n\\n She shrugged. \"Just means we haven\u0027t broken any codes today. TRANSLTR must be taking a break.\"\\n\\n \"A break?\" Brinkerhoff looked doubtful. He\u0027d been with the director long enough to know that \"breaks\" were not part of his preferred modus operandi-particularly with respect to TRANSLTR. Fontaine had paid $2 billion for the code-breaking behemoth, and he wanted his money\u0027s worth. Every second TRANSLTR sat idle was money down the toilet.\\n\\n \"Ah... Midge?\" Brinkerhoff said. \"TRANSLTR doesn\u0027t take any breaks. It runs day and night. You know that.\"\\n\\n She shrugged. \"Maybe Strathmore didn\u0027t feel like hanging out last night to prepare the weekend run. He probably knew Fontaine was away and ducked out early to go fishing.\"\\n\\n \"Come on, Midge.\" Brinkerhoff gave her disgusted look. \"Give the guy a break.\"\\n\\n It was no secret Midge Milken didn\u0027t like Trevor Strathmore. Strathmore had attempted a cunning maneuver rewriting Skipjack, but he\u0027d been caught. Despite Strathmore\u0027s bold intentions, the NSA had paid dearly. The EFF had gained strength, Fontaine had lost credibility with Congress, and worst of all, the agency had lost a lot of its anonymity. There were suddenly housewives in Minnesota complaining to America Online and Prodigy that the NSA might be reading their E-mail-like the NSA gave a damn about a secret recipe for candied yams.\\n\\n Strathmore\u0027s blunder had cost the NSA, and Midge felt responsible-not that she could have anticipated the commander\u0027s stunt, but the bottom line was that an unauthorized action had taken place behind Director Fontaine\u0027s back, a back Midge was paid to cover. Fontaine\u0027s hands-off attitude made him susceptible; and it made Midge nervous. But the director had learned long ago to stand back and let smart people do their jobs; that\u0027s exactly how he handled Trevor Strathmore.\\n\\n \"Midge, you know damn well Strathmore\u0027s not slacking,\" Brinkerhoff argued. \"He runs TRANSLTR like a fiend.\"\\n\\n Midge nodded. Deep down, she knew that accusing Strathmore of shirking was absurd. The commander was as dedicated as they came-dedicated to a fault. He bore the evils of the world as his own personal cross. The NSA\u0027s Skipjack plan had been Strathmore\u0027s brainchild-a bold attempt to change the world. Unfortunately, like so many divine quests, this crusade ended in crucifixion.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" she admitted, \"so I\u0027m being a little harsh.\"\\n\\n \"A little?\" Brinkerhoff eyes narrowed. \"Strathmore\u0027s got a backlog of files a mile long. He\u0027s not about to let TRANSLTR sit idle for a whole weekend.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, okay.\" Midge sighed. \"My mistake.\" She furrowed her brow and puzzled why TRANSLTR hadn\u0027t broken any codes all day. \"Let me double-check something,\" she said, and began flipping through the report. She located what she was looking for and scanned the figures. After a moment she nodded. \"You\u0027re right, Chad. TRANSLTR\u0027s been running full force. Raw consumables are even a little on the high side; we\u0027re at over half a million kilowatt-hours since midnight last night.\"\\n\\n \"So where does that leave us?\"\\n\\n Midge was puzzled. \"I\u0027m not sure. It\u0027s odd.\"\\n\\n \"You want to rerun the data?\"\\n\\n She gave him a disapproving stare. There were two things one never questioned about Midge Milken. One of them was her data. Brinkerhoff waited while Midge studied the figures.\\n\\n \"Huh.\" She finally grunted. \"Yesterday\u0027s stats look fine: 237 codes broken. MCD, $874. Average time per code, a little over six minutes. Raw consumables, average. Last code entering TRANSLTR-\" She stopped.\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s funny,\" she said. \"Last file on yesterday\u0027s queue log ran at 11:37 p.m.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So, TRANSLTR breaks codes every six minutes or so. The last file of the day usually runs closer to midnight. It sure doesn\u0027t look like-\" Midge suddenly stopped short and gasped.\\n\\n Brinkerhoff jumped. \"What!\"\\n\\n Midge was staring at the readout in disbelief. \"This file? The one that entered TRANSLTR last night?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\"\\n\\n \"It hasn\u0027t broken yet. It\u0027s queue time was 23:37:08-but it lists no decrypt time.\" Midge fumbled with the sheets. \"Yesterday or today!\"\\n\\n Brinkerhoff shrugged. \"Maybe those guys are running a tough diagnostic.\"\\n\\n Midge shook her head. \"Eighteen hours tough?\" She paused. \"Not likely. Besides, the queue data says it\u0027s an outside file. We should call Strathmore.\"\\n\\n \"At home?\" Brinkerhoff swallowed. \"On a Saturday night?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Midge said. \"If I know Strathmore, he\u0027s on top of this. I\u0027ll bet good money he\u0027s here. Just a hunch.\" Midge\u0027s hunches were the other thing one never questioned. \"Come on,\" she said, standing up. \"Let\u0027s see if I\u0027m right.\"\\n\\n Brinkerhoff followed Midge to her office, where she sat down and began to work Big Brother\u0027s keypads like a virtuoso pipe organist.\\n\\n Brinkerhoff gazed up at the array of closed-caption video monitors on her wall, their screens all freeze frames of the NSA seal. \"You\u0027re gonna snoop Crypto?\" he asked nervously.\\n\\n \"Nope,\" Midge replied. \"Wish I could, but Crypto\u0027s a sealed deal. It\u0027s got no video. No sound. No nothing. Strathmore\u0027s orders. All I\u0027ve got is approach stats and basic TRANSLTR stuff. We\u0027re lucky we\u0027ve even got that. Strathmore wanted total isolation, but Fontaine insisted on the basics.\"\\n\\n Brinkerhoff looked puzzled. \"Crypto hasn\u0027t got video?\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" she asked, without turning from her monitor. \"You and Carmen looking for a little more privacy?\"\\n\\n Brinkerhoff grumbled something inaudible.\\n\\n Midge typed some more keys. \"I\u0027m pulling Strathmore\u0027s elevator log.\" She studied her monitor a moment and then rapped her knuckle on the desk. \"He\u0027s here,\" she said matter-of-factly. \"He\u0027s in Crypto right now. Look at this. Talk about long hours-he went in yesterday morning bright and early, and his elevator hasn\u0027t budged since. I\u0027m showing no magno-card use for him on the main door. So he\u0027s definitely in there.\"\\n\\n Brinkerhoff breathed a slight sigh of relief. \"So, if Strathmore\u0027s in there, everything\u0027s okay, right?\"\\n\\n Midge thought a moment. \"Maybe,\" she finally decided.\\n\\n \"Maybe?\"\\n\\n \"We should call him and double-check.\"\\n\\n Brinkerhoff groaned. \"Midge, he\u0027s the deputy director. I\u0027m sure he has everything under control. Let\u0027s not second-guess-\"\\n\\n \"Oh, come on, Chad-don\u0027t be such a child. We\u0027re just doing our job. We\u0027ve got a snag in the stats, and we\u0027re following up. Besides,\" she added, \"I\u0027d like to remind Strathmore that Big Brother\u0027s watching. Make him think twice before planning any more of his hare-brained stunts to save the world.\" Midge picked up the phone and began dialing.\\n\\n Brinkerhoff looked uneasy. \"You really think you should bother him?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not bothering him,\" Midge said, tossing him the receiver. \"You are.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-48.html","bookId":2226,"book":{"id":2226,"title":"Digital Fortress","description":"Storyline: When the NSA\u0027s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician.
