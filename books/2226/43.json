She wished she\u0027d exposed Hale when she\u0027d had the chance.\n Hale sat at his terminal. \"Stress is a killer, Sue. Something you want to get off your chest?\"\n Susan forced herself to sit. She had thought Strathmore would be off the phone by now and return to speak to her, but he was nowhere to be seen. Susan tried to keep calm. She gazed at her computer screen. The tracer was still running-for the second time. It was immaterial now. Susan knew whose address it would return:\n [email protected]\n /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */\n Susan gazed up toward Strathmore\u0027s workstation and knew she couldn\u0027t wait any longer. It was time to interrupt the commander\u0027s phone call. She stood and headed for the door.\n Hale seemed suddenly uneasy, apparently noticing Susan\u0027s odd behavior. He strode quickly across the room and beat her to the door. He folded his arms and blocked her exit.\n \"Tell me what\u0027s going on,\" he demanded. \"There\u0027s something going on here today. What is it?\"\n \"Let me out,\" Susan said as evenly as possible, feeling a sudden twinge of danger.\n \"Come on,\" Hale pressed. \"Strathmore practically fired Chartrukian for doing his job. What\u0027s going on inside TRANSLTR? We don\u0027t have any diagnostics that run eighteen hours. That\u0027s bullshit, and you know it. Tell me what\u0027s going on.\"\n Susan\u0027s eyes narrowed. You know damn well what\u0027s going on! \"Back off, Greg,\" she demanded. \"I need to use the bathroom.\"\n Hale smirked. He waited a long moment and then stepped aside. \"Sorry Sue. Just flirting.\"\n Susan pushed by him and left Node 3. As she passed the glass wall, she sensed Hale\u0027s eyes boring into her from the other side.\n Reluctantly, she circled toward the bathrooms. She would have to make a detour before visiting the Commander. Greg Hale could suspect nothing. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-43.html","bookId":2226,"book":{"id":2226,"title":"Digital Fortress","description":"Storyline: \n When the NSA\u0027s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician.
