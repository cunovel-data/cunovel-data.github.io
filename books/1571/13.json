{"id":110034,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"David looked at Hepzebah. She looked at David. Presently, she looked at Sil-Chan. \"Just K-cousin,\" she said. \"It\u0027s close. I\u0027m of the PN\u0027s line. One of my boy-children will be picked to succeed David.\" \"You . . . have children?\" Sil-Chan asked. \"Oh, no. I don\u0027t even have a mate. And the PN\u0027s angry at me, punishing . . .\" \"The PN isn\u0027t that petty,\" David said. He opened the door, exposed a dim interior into which he motioned Sil-Chan. \"My honored guest, Sooma Sil-Chan. Enter my abode and call it your own.\" \"You know my name?\" \"David signed the clearance for the PN,\" Hepzebah said. She followed Sil-Chan into the house. David brought up the rear and closed the door. Sil-Chan stared at the room -- long with a ceiling which reached away to dim rafters. Windows looked out onto the landing field and the wrecked jetter . . . more windows peered into shadowy woods . . . gigantic rock fireplace at one end, smoke blackened. There was a smell of smoke in the room. Odd projections on the walls. Sil-Chan peered at them, realized they were the mounted heads of horned animals. There was a small fire in the fireplace. David crossed to it, stirred up the flame and added more logs. Hepzebah touched Sil-Chan\u0027s arm, said: \"Come over by the fire and let me look at your shoulder. David, get a refresher, a good stiff one.\" \"Right.\" David walked off toward a door opposite the fireplace. Sil-Chan\u0027s mind reeled. This entrancing woman was not wed! David was Aitch Aye. What was that? Sil-Chan felt that he had read of such a relationship somewhere in the Library. Heir Apparent! Yes, of course. And Hepzebah was \u0027of the same line.\u0027 Gods of the universe! This pair was royalty! \"Come along,\" Hepzebah said. Sil-Chan allowed himself to be led to a low-backed divan beside the fireplace. Flames murmured in the logs. The smell of smoke was stronger here. He stumbled over something that rang musically. \"One of the children left a toy,\" Hepzebah said. \"David\u0027s so easy with them.\" She indicated the divan. \"Sit down and take off your jacket. I\u0027ll . . .\" \"No, really. It\u0027s all right,\" Sil-Chan said. Again, he found himself trapped in her eyes -- the soft look of them here in the shadowed room . . . like some forest animal. She\u0027s not wedded. She\u0027s not wedded. \"I\u0027ll have a look all the same,\" she said. She put a light pressure on his shoulder and he sank to the divan. It was soft, absorbing and smelled of animal. Hepzebah bent over him, and Sil-Chan inhaled a mind-rolling musk of perfumed hair. He allowed her to help him out of his jacket and shirt. The jacket was torn at the elbow and he had not even noticed. His flesh tingled where Hepzebah touched him. \"Bad bruise on your shoulder and a scratch above your left elbow,\" she said. She went to a door beside the fireplace, returned in a moment with a cloth which smelled of unguent. The cloth felt cool and soothing where she pressed it to his shoulder. \"What\u0027s a trothing?\" Sil-Chan asked. \"The trothers are the clan elders. They decide if a joining will be good for the clan.\" He swallowed. \"Do you ever . . . wed outside your clan?\" She lowered her eyes. \"Sometimes.\" Sil-Chan studied the soft oval of her face, imagined that face pillowed beside him. His mission, the Archive\u0027s problems, Tchung -- all melted into the distance . . . another planet. \"Drink this.\" It was David suddenly standing behind him, preferring an earthen mug that swirled with pungent brown liquid and a biting aroma. Sil-Chan tasted it: hot, tangy and sharp on the tongue. He downed the drink. Warmth filled him. He re-experienced the inner release he had felt after crashing the jetter -- another person. He stood up. \"How does one arrange a troth?\" he asked. She peered up at him, a smile touching her lips. Something smokey and wondering drifted in her eyes. \"We have several ways. The PN\u0027s K-cousins can take the initiative if the couple ask it.\" \"What\u0027s all this talk of trothing?\" David asked. He came around the divan and stood with his back to the fire. Hepzebah waved a hand in front of Sil-Chan\u0027s eyes, leaned close to stare at him. Sil-Chan said: \"What\u0027re you. . . .\" \"I have the inward eye,\" she said. \"You go very deep. It\u0027s Warm and nice in there.\" David said: \"I asked you . . .\" \"If he\u0027ll have me, David, I\u0027m going to open the troth,\" she said. David looked at Sil-Chan, at Hepzebah. \"I haven\u0027t been out of the room that long, have I? I just went for a drink.\" She touched Sil-Chan tentatively on the wrist. Again, he felt his flesh tingle. \"This is nonsense,\" David said. Her hand stole into Sil-Chan\u0027s. He felt the perfect fit of her there, the perfection of her beside him. \"Will you wed me, Sooma Sil-Chan?\" she asked. \"Hep, you stop this!\" David said. \"Be quiet, David,\" she said, \"or I will tell stories about a young man\u0027s secret visits to the mainland.\" \"Now, Hep! You . . .\" \"Quiet, I said.\" Sil-Chan felt himself bathed in a warm glow -- the drink inside him, Hepzebah\u0027s hand in his. Wed her? \"I\u0027d go to the ends of the universe to wed you,\" he whispered. \"Is that a yes?\" she asked. \"Yes. Yes.\" \"But you\u0027ve only just met!\" David protested. \"The trothers will agree with me,\" she said. \"But I already know. The inward eye never fails.\" She tipped her head, looked up at Sil-Chan from the corners of her eyes. \"I find him very attractive.\" David appeared angry. \"He\u0027s just different.\" \"I\u0027m already certain,\" she said. \"And you heard the question and you heard his response.\" \"This is too much!\" David raged. \"You\u0027re always doing things like this!\" Sil-Chan experienced a crawling of goose flesh. He felt delirious. All those years of celibacy and devotion to duty and career had melted away. \"He\u0027ll never take the name!\" David said. \"Just to look at him you can tell. You\u0027d best accept Martin as the trothers . . .\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/direct-descent/page-13.html","bookId":1571,"book":{"id":1571,"title":"Direct Descent","description":"Storyline: Earth has become a library planet for thousands of years, a bastion of both useful and useless knowledge¡ªesoterica of all types, history, science, politics¡ªgathered by teams of ¡°pack rats¡± who scour the galaxy for any scrap of information.
