{"id":12354,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"It was Kevin McGann who showed him around the Gordak after Brennschluss. Newton\u0027s second law of motion carried the ship forward through the near-vacuum of space now, and it would continue that way, plowing ahead at seven miles per second until it was caught and slowed by the space-station\u0027s gravity. There the bunkers would be reloaded with slow-fission plutonium for the long dash sunward to Mercury. \" ... and through there you\u0027ll find the fission-room,\" Kevin was saying. \"That\u0027s about the size of it, boy. But I warn you to keep away from the fission-room as long as that red light is blinking. Everything inside gets pretty hot, and there\u0027s enough radiation to kill an army unless the shields are up. Even then, I\u0027d recommend a vac-suit.\" \"I\u0027ll remember that,\" Steve said, lighting a cigarette. \"Word gets around a ship like the Gordak pretty fast. I didn\u0027t see your fight with LeClarc, but I sure heard enough about it. There\u0027s only one man aboard ship who can beat the Frenchman in a fair fight, and—\" \"You?\" Steve wanted to know. But it was hardly a question. It looked to him like Kevin could take on two LeClarcs with no trouble at all. \"Yes, boy. Me. But now there are two of us, and you\u0027ve made yourself an enemy. LeClarc doesn\u0027t forget easy, so you\u0027d better be on your guard.\" \"I\u0027ll remember that, too,\" said Steve, laughing. \"But it looks like you keep warning me about something all the time, Kevin. Why?\" \"You\u0027re Charlie Stedman\u0027s kid brother, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Yeah. Yeah, but how did—\" \"How did I know, boy? It\u0027s written all over your face, and Charlie may have been with Barling Interplanetary, but a lot of us knew him. Charlie was the best, boy.\" \"Thanks. Kevin, how did Charlie die?\" The giant shrugged eloquently. \"I don\u0027t know. It was T. J. who found him out on Ganymede. She was out tracking an anthrovac, and you don\u0027t track anthrovacs in crowds. Well, it seems Charlie had landed for Barling, and Charlie had the same idea.\" \"He never told me Teejay was a woman, but he said once she must have been reared in hell.\" Again, Kevin shrugged. \"It\u0027s open to question, boy. I don\u0027t like T. J., but I like working for her. You take a man like LeClarc, he\u0027ll die for T. J. All she\u0027d have to do is ask him, and he\u0027d die. You see, boy, big game hunters don\u0027t come any smarter. Trouble is, T. J. knows it and flaunts it. Also, she\u0027s a woman but she\u0027s strong as a man and knows that, too. She dares you to fight her every step of the way, and it takes a big man to—\" \"I thought you said Charlie was the best!\" \"And I still do. But a man\u0027s got to have some flaws. Maybe he couldn\u0027t take T. J. and had to let her know. The same thing happened to you, after only five minutes. The gals have won their spurs in every field which was strictly masculine a hundred years ago. Men tend to resent that, especially when a talented woman like T. J. let\u0027s them know it, and no bones about it. So, that\u0027s T. J.\" \"Yeah,\" said Steve, frowning. \"That\u0027s Teejay.\" \"What\u0027s the trouble, boy?\" \"I\u0027ve got to find out what happened to Charlie, that\u0027s all. But Teejay\u0027s going to be a problem.\" \"The grandmother of all problems, you mean. With all of that, though, she can still be all female when she wants to be. Maybe Charlie fell for her—\" \"Charlie falling for that cheap, no good—\" \"Careful, boy. She\u0027s my Captain, and a good one. I wouldn\u0027t ship out on the Gordak if I didn\u0027t think so. Careful.\" Then Kevin smiled. \"You\u0027ll learn, in time. Anyway, Charlie was a good-looker and attractive to the girls, he was romantic—so maybe T. J. fell for him, too. Then they had a parting of the ways and—\" \"Sure!\" Steve exploded. \"Sure, they fell in love or something only Charlie forgot to mention in any of his letters she was a woman. You\u0027re barking up the wrong tree, Kevin.\" \"Maybe. Maybe not. I\u0027m only talking off the top of my head, boy. But it\u0027s worth considering.\" Kevin jabbed a thick finger against his calloused palm. \"What I\u0027m getting at is this, whether they made love or not, I don\u0027t think T. J. would kill anyone out of cold blood.\" \"I\u0027ll think about it,\" said Steve, and then a whistle shrilled through the length of the ship. They were nearing the space-station, half as far from Earth as Luna, and deceleration came upon them gradually and would continue to increase until they all had to bed down in the accel-hammocks for landing. Unexpectedly, Teejay herself was checking in the members of the expedition as their two-hour stop over at the station drew to an end. As he approached her along the gangplank, Steve looked down and saw the station-men wheeling the small but tremendously heavy plutonium bunkers under the ship, each compact unit weighing a couple of tons with its concrete shielding. \"Well, Stedman,\" said the woman, the broad black sand-cape wrapped around her completely now, as if only the members of her crew had the right to see what lay beneath it, \"I see you\u0027ve never watched a ship getting ready for blast off.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" Steve admitted. \"First trip out.\" \"You want some pretty sound advice? I\u0027d suggest you stay here at the station and wait for the first Earthbound ship.\" \"Thanks,\" said Steve. \"But Mr. Carmical hired me at least as far as Mercury, so that\u0027s where I\u0027m going.\" Teejay grinned. \"You\u0027re a plucky kid, Stedman. All right, Mercury it is—but LeClarc can do the honors when it\u0027s time to see you off the Gordak for good. He doesn\u0027t exactly like you, Stedman.\" \"I\u0027ve been told that.\" \"All right, move along. There\u0027s a whole line of men I\u0027ve got to check in behind you.\" A plucky kid, Steve thought, and laughed. She\u0027d called him that, although he knew she\u0027d probably have a hard time matching his twenty-five years. Well, she\u0027d spent her life in space and on the frontier worlds. Maybe that did make a difference. Five minutes later, they blasted clear of the space-station on an orbit that would intersect the Mercurian ellipse at perihelion. From there, the Gordak would visit Venus, Mars, the planetoid Ceres, the four large Jovian moons, Titan and Uranus. Ten worlds in all the hunters would touch on—and each world would offer up its native fauna for the Brody Carmical Circus. Steve wondered if there\u0027d be trouble with Barling Brothers Interplanetary. There generally was. But then he smiled without mirth, for the chances were he\u0027d never get beyond the first landing on Mercury, anyway.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2816/77846.html","bookId":499,"book":{"id":499,"title":"Jungle in the Sky","description":"简介： The big man looked at home among his trophies.
