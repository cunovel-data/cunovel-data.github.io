That doesn\u0027t mean any young pup who comes along can fill it. Ever been off the Earth, Mr. Stedman?\" \"No.\" \"Ever been off the North American continent?\" \"No.\" \"But you want to go galavanting around the Solar System in search of big game. Tell me—do you think they have a Harvard club on every stinking satellite you\u0027ll visit? Do you think you can eat beefsteak and drink martinis in every frontier-world dive? Let me tell you, Mr. Stedman, the answer is no.\" \"Try me, sir. That\u0027s all I ask—try me.\" \"We\u0027re not running a school, Mr. Stedman. Either a man\u0027s got it or he hasn\u0027t. You haven\u0027t. Come back in ten years. Ship out around the Solar System the hard way, and maybe we can use you then—if you still remember what you learned about Extra-terrestrial zoology. What in space ever made you study extra-zoo, anyway?\" \"I found it interesting,\" Steve said lamely. \"Interesting? As a hobby, it\u0027s interesting. But as business, it\u0027s hard work, a lot of sweat, a lot of danger, squirming around on your soft belly in the muck and mud of a dozen worlds, that\u0027s what it is. Just how do you think Carmical Enterprises got where they are? Sweat and grief, Mr. Stedman.\" Carmical yawned hugely and popped a glob of chocolate into his mouth. His fat lips worked for a moment, then his Adam\u0027s apple bobbed up and down. Steve got up, paced back and forth in front of the desk. \"I won\u0027t take no for an answer, Mr. Carmical.\" \"Eh? What\u0027s that? I could have you thrown out of here.\" \"You won\u0027t,\" Steve told him calmly. \"Maybe I\u0027m just what the doctor ordered, but you\u0027ll never know until you try me. So—\" \"So nothing! I said this isn\u0027t a school.\" \"They tell me the Gordak leaves on a ten-world junket tomorrow. All I ask is this: let me ship along as the zoology man. Then, if you\u0027re not satisfied, you can leave me at your first port-of-call—without pay.\" Carmical smiled triumphantly. \"You know where we space out for first, Mr. Stedman? Mercury, that\u0027s where. I\u0027d love to see a sassy young pup like you set loose on Mercury in one of the Twilight Cities.\" \"Is it a deal?\" \"It sure is, Stedman. It sure is! But I warn you, we\u0027ll expect perfection. You\u0027ll not have a chance to profit from your own mistakes. You won\u0027t have a chance to make mistakes. One slip and you\u0027ve had it, is that understood?\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m not going, of course,\" Carmical said, patting his great paunch and saying with the action that he was too old and too fat for space. \"But I\u0027ll hear all about the way you were stranded on Mercury, among a lot of Merkies and—\" Steve smiled grimly, said: \"No you won\u0027t. Next time you see me will be after the ten-world junket. Whom do I ask for on the Gordak?\" Carmical dialed for a bromo, watched it fizz in the glass, drank it, belched. \"T. J. Moore\u0027s in charge,\" he told Steve. \"Old T. J.\u0027s a mighty rough taskmaster, Stedman. Don\u0027t say you weren\u0027t warned.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll hear about how you were stranded on Mercury,\" Carmical predicted. \"You\u0027ll see me after the ten-world junket,\" said Steve, and closed the door softly behind him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2816/77842.html","bookId":499,"book":{"id":499,"title":"Jungle in the Sky","description":"简介： The big man looked at home among his trophies.
