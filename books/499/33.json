He did not have to breathe at all. It was as if his life had been suspended completely, as if there was no need for his body to carry out its normal functions. But he wasn\u0027t dead. He could open his eyes and stare at the green liquid, and he could think. And after a time, vague forms appeared outside.

No longer wet, they were digits of fire now, burning, burning. Steve screamed soundlessly and fainted.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2816/77873.html","bookId":499,"book":{"id":499,"title":"Jungle in the Sky","description":"简介： The big man looked at home among his trophies.
