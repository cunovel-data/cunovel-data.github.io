{"id":12374,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"Charlie cleared his throat. Quite evidently, it wasn\u0027t Charlie at all, but Steve could think of the man in no other way, for down to the smallest physical detail, he was Charlie. \"That will suffice,\" he said. Again, it was Charlie\u0027s voice, but expressionless. \"Enough of bickering. You will all march with me toward those hills, and we have a long journey before sunset.\" The nine-foot anthrovacs took up their positions one on each side of the column and one behind it, and no one disobeyed. Once Steve looked back over his shoulder and saw the purple mists had almost completely swallowed the Frank Buck. Then the irony of the situation struck Steve and he smiled—almost. He\u0027d come to Ganymede after anthrovacs. But he\u0027d left the satellite under an anthrovac guard! Fine thing. A mighty hunter was he! Clear across the universe to be bagged by his own game! Obviously, Steve thought as they marched on, the blue day-star was not Earth\u0027s sun. Somehow, in a matter of moments, they\u0027d left the Solar System entirely. He knew that theories had been advanced about traveling through something called sub-space, something which could make flight to the farthest stars almost instantaneous, since sub-space existed outside the space-time continuum. And that wrenching from one spatial plane to another might explain the tremendous pain they\u0027d undergone, too. But surely the Frank Buck had never been equipped for such flight. The whole concept of sub-space flight was strictly theoretical and hadn\u0027t even reached the drawing-board stage. Then how had it happened? Kevin had some vague, half-formed ideas on the subject, and he let Steve know about them. \"It\u0027s a puzzler, boy. They took us a long way, space alone knows how far. I don\u0027t pretend to know why; we can\u0027t figure that out, not yet. But I know this: they could not have done that without help. Someone had to bring the ship.\" \"The anthrovacs?\" Steve suggested. \"Not the anthrovacs. For all their handling neutron guns and taking the Frank Buck over, they\u0027re just big apes to me. Maybe they were able to take the ship off Ganymede, but no more than that. They had help, boy, and from the inside.\" \"Who? Who do you mean?\" \"I\u0027m not sure I know. But look at it this way. The Gordak wasn\u0027t taken, the Frank Buck was. Why? I\u0027ll tell you why, or at least I\u0027ll tell you one possibility. There were scores of men on each ship, but while the Gordak had only one animal—the stone worm you got on Mercury—the Frank Buck had dozens. All right so far, boy? Well, here\u0027s what I think: whoever took the ship wanted both men and animals.\" \"I still don\u0027t understand.\" \"I\u0027m not sure I do, either. Let\u0027s get back a little. The Frank Buck, not the Gordak, was taken. Strange, isn\u0027t it, that just before that happened LeClarc bolted our ranks and joined the enemy! Does that mean LeClarc had to be on the Frank Buck before anything happened? And where\u0027d he get to, anyway? I haven\u0027t seen him since the fight; I don\u0027t think anyone has. Now, a man spends years idolizing a woman—I\u0027ve been around, and I think I told you LeClarc would have done anything for Captain Moore. Suddenly, he gets sulky because he\u0027s out of favor with her, and decides on a double-cross. \"It smells bad, boy. Sure, he was sulky, but the LeClarc I knew would have come crawling to Captain Moore, anyway. This one didn\u0027t.\" Kevin paused, ran a hand through his red hair. \"Maybe it means he isn\u0027t the same man. Maybe it means he\u0027s something like that thing which calls itself your brother. That\u0027s not Charlie Stedman and you know it. Trouble is, boy, you can\u0027t admit it to yourself.\" \"I won\u0027t argue about it,\" Steve replied. \"But you\u0027re off the beam there. Charlie doesn\u0027t remember me, but LeClarc\u0027s memory seemed fine.\" \"That\u0027s true, Steve. I can\u0027t explain it, except like this: whatever happened to both of them, we don\u0027t know a thing about it. Maybe it works in a different way on different people. Maybe because Charlie was dead first, his personal memories were a loss, but LeClarc\u0027s weren\u0027t because he might have been possessed alive.\" \"Possessed?\" \"Yes, possessed. Oh, not by spirits, that\u0027s for sure. But possessed nevertheless. I won\u0027t say the anthrovacs were possessed, for we don\u0027t know enough about them to begin with. But look at those other animals now, the ones that died. You won\u0027t deny that something took over their brains?\" \"Damned right I won\u0027t. But I still don\u0027t see how it all adds up.\" \"Nor do I,\" said Kevin. \"Unfortunately, the brutes seemed to have perished in transit from Ganymede to here, wherever here is. It could be that the strain on their brain-tissue, with sentience and intelligence taking over where before only sentience had resided, was too great.\" Kevin paused, then concluded: \"whatever the reason, whatever the reason for all of it—I think you\u0027ll find LeClarc knows all about it.\" The blue sun had neared the horizon and the purple mists had become cool and chilling at journey\u0027s end. It was then that they saw LeClarc. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2816/77866.html","bookId":499,"book":{"id":499,"title":"Jungle in the Sky","description":"简介： The big man looked at home among his trophies.
