{"id":110058,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"19\n We\u0027re OKAY, AS LONG AS THINGS DON\u0027T GET WEIRD\n ALVIN AND MOHAMMED\n When Charlie arrived home from his mother\u0027s funeral, he was met at the door by two very large, very enthusiastic canines, who, undistracted by keeping watch over Sophie\u0027s love hostage, were now able to visit the full measure of their affection and joy upon their returning master. It is generally agreed, and in fact stated in the bylaws of the American Kennel Club, that you have not been truly dog-humped until you have been double-dog-humped by a pair of four-hundred-pound hounds from hell (Section 5, paragraph 7: Standards of Humping and Ass-dragging). And despite having used an extra-strength antiperspirant that very morning before leaving Sedona, Charlie found that getting poked repeatedly in the armpits by two damp devil-dog dicks was leaving him feeling less than fresh.\n \"Sophie, call them off. Call them off.\"\n \"The puppies are dancing with Daddy.\" Sophie giggled. \"Dance, Daddy!\"\n Mrs. Ling covered Sophie\u0027s eyes to shield her from the abomination of her father\u0027s unwilling journey into bestiality. \"Go wash hands, Sophie. Have lunch while you daddy make nasty with shiksas.\" Mrs. Ling couldn\u0027t help but do a quick appraisal of the monetary value of the slippery red dogwoods currently pummeling her landlord\u0027s oxford-cloth shirt like piston-driven leviathan lipsticks. The herbalist in Chinatown would pay a fortune for a powder made from the desiccated members of Alvin and Mohammed. (The men of her homeland would go to any length to enhance their virility, including grinding up endangered species and brewing them in tea, not unlike certain American presidents, who believe there is no stiffy like the one you get from bombing a few thousand foreigners.) Yet it appeared that the desiccated-dog-dick fortune would remain unclaimed. Mrs. Ling had long ago given up on collecting hellhound bits, when after trying to dispatch Alvin with a sharp and ringing blow to the cranium from her cast-iron skillet, he bit the skillet off its handle, crunched it down in a slurry of dog drool and iron filings, and then sat up and begged for seconds.\n \"Throw some water on them!\" Charlie cried. \"Down, doggies. Good doggies. Oh, yuck.\"\n Mrs. Ling was galvanized into action by Charlie\u0027s distress call, and timing her move with the oscillating pyramid of man and dog meat in the doorway, dashed by Charlie, into the hallway, and down the steps.\n LILY\n Lily came up the stairs and skidded to a stop on the hallway carpet when she saw the hellhounds pounding away at Charlie. \"Oh, Asher, you sick bastard!\"\n \"Help,\" Charlie said.\n Lily pulled the fire extinguisher off the wall, dragged it to the doorway, pulled the pin, and proceeded to unload on the bouncing trio. Two minutes later Charlie was collapsed in a frosty heap on the threshold and Alvin and Mohammed were locked in Charlie\u0027s bedroom, where they were joyfully chewing away on the expended fire extinguisher. Lily had lured them in there when they had tried to bite the CO2 stream, seeming to enjoy the freezing novelty of it over the welcome-home humping they were giving Charlie.\n \"You okay?\" Lily said. She was wearing one of her chef coats over a red leather skirt and knee-high platform boots.\n \"It\u0027s been kind of a rough week,\" Charlie said.\n She helped him to his feet, trying to avoid touching the damp spots on his shirt. Charlie did a controlled fall toward the couch. Lily helped him land, ending with one arm pinned awkwardly under his back.\n \"Thanks,\" Charlie said. There was still frost in his hair and eyelashes from the fire extinguisher.\n \"Asher,\" Lily said, trying not to look him in the eye. \"I\u0027m not comfortable with this, but I think, given the situation, that it\u0027s time I said something.\"\n \"Okay, Lily. You want some coffee?\"\n \"No. Please shut up. Thank you.\" She paused and took a deep breath, but did not extricate her arm from behind Charlie\u0027s back. \"You have been good to me over the years, and although I would not admit this to anyone else, I probably wouldn\u0027t have finished school or turned out as well as I have if it hadn\u0027t been for your influence.\"\n Charlie was still trying to see, blinking away ice crystals on his eyelids, thinking that maybe his eyeballs were frostbitten. \"It was nothing,\" he said.\n \"Please, please, shut up,\" Lily said. Another deep breath. \"You have always been decent to me, despite what I would call some of my bitchier moments, and in spite of the fact that you are some dark death dude, and probably had other things to worry about - sorry about your mom, by the way.\"\n \"Thanks,\" Charlie said.\n \"Well, given what I\u0027ve heard about your night out before your mom died and whatnot, and what I\u0027ve seen here today, I think - that it\u0027s only right - that I do you.\"\n \"Do me?\"\n \"Yes,\" she said, \"for the greater good, even though you are a complete tool.\"\n Charlie squirmed away from her on the couch. He looked at her for a second, trying to figure out if she was putting him on, then, deciding that she wasn\u0027t, he said, \"That\u0027s very sweet of you, Lily, and - \"\n \"Nothing weird, Asher. You need to understand that I\u0027m only doing this out of basic human decency and pity. You can just take it to the hoes on Broadway if you need to get your freak on.\"\n \"Lily, I don\u0027t know what - \"\n \"And not in the butt,\" Lily added.\n There was a high-pitched little-girl giggle from behind the couch. \"Hi, Daddy,\" Sophie said, popping up behind him. \"I missed you.\"\n Charlie swung her up over the back of the couch and gave her a big kiss. \"I missed you, too, sweetie.\"\n Sophie pushed him away. \"How come you have frosting on your hair?\"\n \"Oh, that - Lily had to spray some frost on Alvin and Mohammed to settle them down and it got on me.\"\n \"They missed you, too.\"\n \"I could tell,\" Charlie said. \"Honey, could you go play in your room for a bit while I talk to Lily about business?\"\n \"Where are the puppies?\" Sophie asked.\n \"They\u0027re having a T.O. in Daddy\u0027s room. Can you go play and we\u0027ll have some Cheese Newts in a little while?\"\n \"Okay,\" Sophie said, sliding to the floor. \"Bye, Lily.\" She waved to Lily.\n \"Bye, Sophie,\" Lily said, looking even more pale than usual.\n Sophie marched away in rhythm to her new chant, \"Not in the butt - not in the butt - not in the butt.\"\n Charlie turned to face Lily. \"Well, that ought to liven up Mrs. Magnussen\u0027s first-grade class.\"\n \"Sure, it\u0027s embarrassing now,\" Lily said, without missing a beat, \"but someday she\u0027ll thank me.\"\n Charlie tried to look at his shirt buttons as if he were deep in thought, but instead started to giggle, tried to stop, and ended up snorting a little. \"Jeez, Lily, you\u0027re like a little sister to me, I could never - \"\n \"Oh, fine. I offer you a gift, out of the goodness of my heart, and you - \"\n \"Coffee, Lily,\" Charlie said with a sigh. \"Could I just get you to make me a cup of coffee instead of doing me - and sit and talk to me while I drink it? You\u0027re the only one who knows what\u0027s going on with Sophie and me, and I need to try to sort things out.\"\n \"Well, that will probably take longer than doing you,\" Lily said, looking at her watch. \"Let me call down to the store and tell Ray that I\u0027ll be a while.\"\n \"That would be great,\" Charlie said.\n \"I was only going to do you in exchange for information about your Death Merchant thing, anyway,\" Lily said, picking up the phone on the breakfast bar.\n Charlie sighed again. \"That\u0027s what I need to sort out.\"\n \"Either way,\" Lily said, \"I\u0027m unbending on the butt issue.\"\n Charlie tried to nod gravely, but started giggling again. Lily chucked the San Francisco Yellow Pages at him.\n THE MORRIGAN\n \"This soul smells like ham,\" said Nemain, wrinkling her nose at a lump of meat she had impaled on one long claw.\n \"I want some,\" said Babd. \"Gimme.\" She slashed at the carrion with her own talons, snagging a fist-sized hunk of flesh in the process.\n The three were in a forgotten subbasement beneath Chinatown, lounging on timbers that had been burned black in the great fire of 1906. Macha, who was starting to manifest the pearl headdress she wore in her woman form, studied the skull of a small animal by the light of a candle she\u0027d made from the fat of dead babies. (Macha was ever the artsy-craftsy one, and the other two were jealous of her skills.) \"I don\u0027t understand why the soul is in the meat, but not in a man.\"\n \"Tastes like ham, too, I think,\" Nemain said, spitting glowing red bits of soul when she talked. \"Macha, do you remember ham? Do we like it?\"\n Babd ate her bit of meat and wiped her claws on her breast feathers. \"I think ham is new,\" she said, \"like cell phones.\"\n \"Ham is not new,\" Macha said. \"It\u0027s smoked pork.\"\n \"No,\" said Babd, aghast.\n \"Yes,\" said Macha.\n \"Not human flesh? Then how is there a soul in it?\"\n \"Thank you,\" Macha said. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been trying to say.\"\n \"I\u0027ve decided that we like ham,\" said Nemain.\n \"There\u0027s something wrong,\" Macha said. \"It shouldn\u0027t be this easy.\"\n \"Easy?\" said Babd. \"Easy? It\u0027s taken hundreds - no, thousands of years to get this far. How many thousands of years, Nemain?\" Babd looked to the poison sister.\n \"Many,\" said Nemain.\n \"Many,\" said Babd. \"Many thousands of years. That\u0027s not easy.\"\n \"Souls coming to us, without bodies, without the soul stealers, that seems too easy.\"\n \"I like it,\" Nemain said.\n They were quiet for a moment, Nemain nibbled at the glowing soul, Babd preened, and Macha studied the animal skull, turning it over in her talons.\n \"I think it\u0027s a woodchuck,\" Macha said.\n \"Can you make ham from woodchuck?\" Nemain asked.\n \"Don\u0027t know,\" said Macha.\n \"I don\u0027t remember woodchuck,\" Nemain said.\n Babd sighed heavily. \"Things are going so well. Do you two ever think about when we are Above all the time, and Darkness rules all, about, you know, what then?\"\n \"What do you mean, what then?\" Macha asked. \"We will hold dominion over all souls, and visit death as we wish until we consume all the light of humanity.\"\n \"Yeah, I know,\" Babd said, \"but then what? I mean, you know, dominion and all that is nice, but will Orcus always have to be around, snorting and growling?\"\n Macha put down her skull and sat up on a blackened beam. \"What\u0027s this about?\"\n Nemain smiled, her teeth perfectly even, the canines just a little too long. \"She\u0027s pining about that skinny soul stealer with the sword.\"\n \"New Meat?\" Macha couldn\u0027t believe her ears, which had become visible only a few days ago when the first of the gift souls had wandered into their claws, so they hadn\u0027t been tested in a while. \"You like New Meat?\"\n \"Like is a little strong,\" Babd said. \"I just think he\u0027s interesting.\"\n \"Interesting in that you\u0027d like to arrange his entrails in interesting patterns in the dirt?\" Macha said.\n \"Well, no, I\u0027m not talented that way like you.\"\n Macha looked at Nemain, who grinned and shrugged. \"We could probably try to kill Orcus once Darkness rises,\" Nemain said.\n \"I am a little tired of his preaching, and he\u0027ll be impossible if the Luminatus doesn\u0027t appear.\" Macha shrugged a surrender. \"Sure, why not.\"\n THE EMPEROR\n The Emperor of San Francisco was troubled. He sensed that something very wrong was going on in the City, yet he was at a loss as to what to do. He didn\u0027t want to alarm the people unduly, but he did not want them to be unprepared for whatever danger they might face. He believed that a just and benevolent ruler would not use fear to manipulate his people, and until he had some sort of proof that there was an actual threat, it would be criminal to call for any action.\n \"Sometimes,\" he said to Lazarus, the steadfast golden retriever, \"a man must muster all of his courage to simply sit still. How much humanity has been spoiled for the confusion of movement with progress, my friend? How much?\"\n Still, he\u0027d been seeing things, strange things. One late night in Chinatown he\u0027d seen a dragon made of fog snaking through the streets. Then, early one morning, down by the Boudin Bakery at Ghirardelli Square, he saw what looked like a nude woman covered in motor oil crawl out of a storm sewer and grab a tall, half-full latte cup out of the trash, then dive right back in the sewer as a policeman on a bicycle rounded the corner. He knew that he saw these things because he was more sensitive than other people, and because he lived on the streets and could sense the slightest nuance of change there, and largely because he was completely barking-at-the-moon batshit. But none of that relieved him of the responsibility to his people, nor did it ease his mind about the disturbing nature of what he was seeing.\n The squirrel in the hoop skirt was really bothering the Emperor, but he couldn\u0027t exactly say why. He liked squirrels - often took the men to Golden Gate Park to chase them, in fact - but a squirrel walking upright and digging through the trash behind the Empanada Emporium while wearing a pink ball gown from the eighteenth century - well - it was off-putting. He was sure that Bummer, who was curled up sleeping in the oversized pocket of his coat, would agree. (Bummer, being a rat dog at heart, had a less than enlightened outlook upon coexistence with any rodent, no less one dressed for the court of Louis XVI.)\n \"Not to be critical,\" said the Emperor, \"but shoes would be a welcome complement to the ensemble, don\u0027t you think, Lazarus?\"\n Lazarus, normally tolerant of all noncookie creatures great and small, growled at the squirrel, who appeared to have the feet of a chicken sticking out from under her skirt, which - you know - was weird.\n With the growl, Bummer squirmed awake and emerged from the woolen bedchamber like Grendel from his lair. He immediately erupted into an apoplectic barking fit, as if to say, You guys, in case you didn\u0027t notice, there\u0027s a squirrel in a ball gown going through the trash over there and you\u0027re just sitting here like a couple of concrete library lions! The message thus barked, off he went, a furry squirrel-seeking missile, bent on single-minded annihilation of all things rodent.\n \"Bummer,\" called the Emperor. \"Wait.\"\n Too late. The squirrel had tried to take off up the side of the brick building, but snagged her skirt on a gutter and fell back to the alley, just as Bummer was hitting full stride. Then the squirrel snatched up a small board from a broken pallet and swung it at his pursuer, who leapt just in time to miss taking a nail in one of his bug eyes.\n Growling ensued.\n The Emperor noticed at that point that the squirrel\u0027s hands were reptilian in nature, the fingernails painted a pleasant pink to match her gown.\n \"You don\u0027t see that every day,\" the Emperor said. Lazarus barked in agreement.\n The squirrel dropped the board and took off toward the street, moving nicely on her chicken feet, her skirt held up in her lizard hands. Bummer had recovered from the initial shock of a weapon-wielding squirrel (something he had encountered before only in doggie nightmares brought on by the late-night gift of chorizo pizza from a charitable Domino\u0027s guy) and took off after the squirrel, followed closely by the Emperor and Lazarus.\n \"No, Bummer,\" the Emperor called. \"She\u0027s not a normal squirrel.\"\n Lazarus, because he did not know how to say \"well, duh,\" stopped in his tracks and looked at the Emperor.\n The squirrel rocketed out of the alley and took a quick turn down the gutter, falling now to all fours as she went.\n Just as he reached the corner, the Emperor saw the trail of the tiny pink dress disappear down a storm sewer, followed closely by the intrepid Bummer. The Emperor could hear the terrier\u0027s bark echoing out of the grate, fading as Bummer pursued his prey into the darkness.\n RIVERA\n Nick Cavuto sat down across from Rivera with a plate of buffalo stew roughly the size of a garbage-can lid. They were having lunch at Tommy\u0027s Joynt, an old-school eatery on Van Ness that served home-style food like meat loaf, roasted turkey and stuffing, and buffalo stew every day of the year, and featured San Francisco sports teams on the TV over the bar whenever anyone was playing.\n \"What?\" said the big cop, when he saw his partner roll his eyes. \"Fucking what?\"\n \"Buffalo almost went extinct once,\" Rivera said. \"You have ancestors on the Great Plains?\"\n \"Special law enforcement portions - protecting and serving and stuff requires protein.\"\n \"A whole bison?\"\n \"Do I criticize your hobbies?\"\n Rivera looked at his half a turkey sandwich and cup of bean soup, then at Cavuto\u0027s stew, then at his runt of a sandwich, then at his partner\u0027s colossus of a stew. \"My lunch is embarrassed,\" he said.\n \"Serves you right. Revenge for the Italian suits. I love going to every call with people thinking I\u0027m the victim.\"\n \"You could buy a steamer, or I could have my guy find you some nice clothes.\"\n \"Your guy the serial-killing thrift-store owner? No thanks.\"\n \"He\u0027s not a serial killer. He\u0027s got some weird shit going on, but he\u0027s not a killer.\"\n \"Just what we need, more weird shit. What was he really doing when you had that shots-fired report?\"\n \"Just like it said, I was going by and a guy tried to rob him at gunpoint. I drew my weapon and told the perp to halt, he drew down on me, and I fired.\"\n \"Your ass. You never fired eleven shots in your life you didn\u0027t hit the ten X ring with nine of them. The fuck happened?\"\n Rivera looked down the long table, made sure the three guys sitting down at the other end were engaged in the game showing on the TV over the bar. \"I hit her with every shot.\"\n \"Her? Perp was a woman?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t say that.\"\n Cavuto dropped his spoon. \"Partner? Don\u0027t tell me you shot the redhead? I thought that was over.\"\n \"No. This was a new thing - like - Nick, you know me, I\u0027m not going to fire unless it\u0027s justified.\"\n \"Just say what happened. I got your back.\"\n \"It was like this bird woman or something. All black. I mean fucking black as tar. Had claws that looked like - I don\u0027t know, like three-inch-long silver ice picks or something. My shots took chunks out of her - feathers and black goo and shit everywhere. She took nine in the torso and flew away.\"\n \"Flew?\"\n Rivera sipped his coffee, eyeing his partner\u0027s reaction over the edge of the cup. They had been through some extraordinary things working together, but if the situation had been reversed, he wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d believe this story either. \"Yeah, flew.\"\n Cavuto nodded. \"Okay, I can see why you wouldn\u0027t put that in the report.\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"So this bird woman,\" Cavuto said, like that was settled, he totally believed it, now what? \"She was robbing the Asher guy from the thrift shop?\"\n \"Giving him a hand job.\"\n Cavuto nodded, picked up his spoon, and took a huge bite of stew and rice, still nodding as he chewed. He looked as if he were going to say something, then quickly took another bite, as if to stop himself. He appeared to be distracted by the game on television, and finished his lunch without another word.\n Rivera ate his soup and sandwich in silence as well.\n As they were leaving, Cavuto grabbed two toothpicks from the dispenser by the register and gave one to Rivera as they walked out into a beautiful San Francisco day.\n \"So you were following Asher?\"\n \"I\u0027ve been trying to keep an eye on him. Just in case.\"\n \"And you shot her nine times for giving the guy a hand job,\" Cavuto finally asked.\n \"I guess,\" Rivera said.\n \"You know, Alphonse, that right there is why I don\u0027t hang out with you socially. Your values are fucked up.\"\n \"She wasn\u0027t human, Nick.\"\n \"Still. A hand job? Deadly force? I don\u0027t know - \"\n \"It wasn\u0027t deadly force. I didn\u0027t kill her.\"\n \"Nine to the chest?\"\n \"I saw her - it - last night. On my street. Watching me from a storm sewer.\"\n \"Ever think to ask Asher how he happened to know the flying bulletproof bird woman in the first place?\"\n \"Yeah, I did, but I can\u0027t tell you what he said. It\u0027s too weird.\"\n Cavuto threw his arms in the air. \"Well, sweet Tidy Bowl Jesus skipping on the blue toilet water, we wouldn\u0027t want it to get fucking weird, would we?\"\n LILY\n They were on their second cup of coffee and Charlie had told Lily about not getting the two soul vessels, about the encounter with the sewer harpy, about the shadow coming out of the mountains in Sedona and the other version of The Great Big Book of Death, and his suspicions that there was a frightening problem with his little girl, the symptoms of which were two giant dogs and an ability to kill with the word kitty. To Charlie\u0027s thinking, Lily was reacting to the wrong story.\n \"You hooked up with a demon from the Underworld and I\u0027m not good enough for you?\"\n \"It\u0027s not a competition, Lily. Can we not talk about that? I knew I shouldn\u0027t have told you. I\u0027m worried about other stuff.\"\n \"I want details, Asher.\"\n \"Lily, a gentleman doesn\u0027t share the details of his amorous encounters.\"\n Lily crossed her arms and assumed a pose of disgusted incredulity, an eloquent pose, because before she said it, Charlie knew what was coming: \"Bullshit. That cop shot pieces off her, but you\u0027re worried about protecting her honor?\"\n Charlie smiled wistfully. \"You know, we shared a moment - \"\n \"Oh my God, you complete man-whore!\"\n \"Lily, you can\u0027t possibly be hurt by my - by my response to your generous - and let me say right here - extraordinarily tempting offer. Gee whiz.\"\n \"It\u0027s because I\u0027m too perky, isn\u0027t it? Not dark enough for you? You being Mr. Death and all.\"\n \"Lily, the shadow in Sedona was coming for me. When I left town, it went away. The sewer harpy came for me. The other Death Merchant said that I was different. They never had deaths happen as a result of their presence like I have.\"\n \"Did you just say \u0027gee whiz\u0027 to me? What am I, nine? I am a woman - \"\n \"I think I might be the Luminatus, Lily.\"\n Lily shut up.\n She raised her eyebrows. As if \"no.\"\n Charlie nodded. As if \"yes.\"\n \"The Big Death?\"\n \"With a capital D,\" Charlie said.\n \"Well, you\u0027re totally not qualified for that,\" Lily said.\n \"Thanks, I feel better now.\"\n MINTY FRESH\n Being two hundred feet under the sea always made Minty uneasy, especially if he\u0027d been drinking sake and listening to jazz all night, which he had. He was in the last car on the last train out of Oakland, and he had the car to himself, like his own private submarine, cruising under the Bay with the echo of a tenor sax in his ear like sonar, and a half-dozen sake-sodden spicy tuna rolls sitting in his stomach like depth charges.\n He\u0027d spent his evening at Sato\u0027s on the Embarcadero, Japanese restaurant and jazz club. Sushi and jazz, strange bedfellows, shacked up by opportunity and oppression. It began in the Fillmore district, which had been a Japanese neighborhood before World War II. When the Japanese were shipped off to internment camps, and their homes and belongings sold off, the blacks, who came to the city to work in the shipyards building battleships and destroyers, moved into the vacant buildings. Jazz came close behind.\n For years, the Fillmore was the center of the San Francisco jazz scene, and Bop City on Post Street the premier jazz club. When the war ended and the Japanese returned, many a late night might find Japanese kids standing under the windows of Bop City, listening to the likes of Billie Holiday, Oscar Peterson, or Charles Mingus, listening to art happen and dissipate into the San Francisco nights. Sato was one of those kids.\n It wasn\u0027t just historical happenstance - Sato had explained to Minty, late one night after the music had ended and the sake was making him wax eloquent - it was philosophical alignment: jazz was a Zen art, dig? Controlled spontaneity. Like sumi-e ink painting, like haiku, like archery, like kendo fencing - jazz wasn\u0027t something you planned, it was something you did. You practiced, you played your scales, you learned your chops, then you brought all your knowledge, your conditioning, to the moment. \"And in jazz, every moment is a crisis,\" Sato quoted Wynton Marsalis, \"and you bring all your skill to bear on that crisis.\" Like the swordsman, the archer, the poet, and the painter - it\u0027s all right there - no future, no past, just that moment and how you deal with it. Art happens.\n And Minty, taken by the need to escape his life as Death, had taken the train to Oakland to find a moment he could hide in, without the regret of the past or the anxiety of the future, just a pure right now resting in the bell of a tenor sax. But the sake, too much future looming ahead, and too much water overhead had brought on the blues, the moment melted, and Minty was uneasy. Things were going badly. He\u0027d been unable to retrieve his last two soul vessels - a first in his career - and he was starting to see, or hear, the effects. Voices out of the storm sewers - louder and more numerous than ever - taunting him. Things moving in the shadows, on the periphery of his vision, shuffling, scuffling dark things that disappeared when you looked right at them.\n He\u0027d even sold three discs off the soul-vessels rack to the same person, another first. He hadn\u0027t noticed it was the same woman right away, but when things started to go wrong, the faces played back and he realized. She\u0027d been a monk the first time, a Buddhist monk of some kind, wearing gold-and-maroon robes, her hair very short, as if her head had been shaved and was growing out. What he remembered was that her eyes were a crystal blue, unusual in someone with such dark hair and skin. And there was a smile deep in those eyes that made him feel as if a soul had found its rightful place, a good home at a higher level. The next time he\u0027d seen her was six months later and she was in jeans and leather jacket, her hair sort of out of control. She\u0027d taken a CD from the \"One Per Customer\" rack, a Sarah McLachlan, which is what he\u0027d have chosen for her if asked, and he barely noticed the crystal-blue eyes other than to think that he\u0027d seen that smile before. Then, last week, it was her again, with hair down around her shoulders, wearing a long skirt and a belted muslin poet\u0027s shirt - like an escapee from a Renaissance fair, not unusual for the Haight, but not quite common in the Castro - still, he thought nothing of it, until she had paid him and glanced over the top of her sunglasses to count the cash out of her wallet. The blue eyes again, electric and not quite smiling this time. He didn\u0027t know what to do. He had no proof she was the monk, the chick in the leather jacket, but he knew it was her. He brought all his skills to bear on the situation, and essentially, he folded.\n \"So you like Mozart?\" he asked her.\n \"It\u0027s for a friend\" was all she said.\n He rationalized not confronting her by that simple statement. A soul vessel was supposed to find its rightful owner, right? It didn\u0027t say he had to sell it directly to them. That had been a week ago, and since then the voices, the scuffling noises in the shadows, the general creepiness, had been nearly constant. Minty Fresh had spent most of his adult life alone, but never before had he felt the loneliness so profoundly. A dozen times in the last few weeks he\u0027d been tempted to call one of the other Death Merchants under the pretense of warning them about his screwup, but mainly just to talk to someone who had a clue about what his life was like.\n He stretched his long legs out over three train seats and into the aisle, then closed his eyes and laid his head back against the window, feeling the rhythm of the rattling train coming through the cool glass against his shaved scalp. Oh no, that wasn\u0027t going to work. Too much sake and something akin to bed spins. He jerked his head forward and opened his eyes, then noticed through the doors that the train had gone dark two cars up. He sat upright and watched as the lights went out in the next car - no, that\u0027s not what happened. Darkness moved through the car like a flowing gas, taking the energy out of the lights as it went.\n \"Oh, shit,\" Minty said to the empty car.\n He couldn\u0027t even stand up inside the train, but stand up he did, staying slumped a little, his head against the ceiling, but facing the flowing darkness.\n The door at the end of the car opened and someone stepped through. A woman. Well, not exactly a woman. What looked like the shadow of a woman.\n \"Hey, lover,\" it said. A low voice, smoky.\n He\u0027d heard this voice before, or a voice like it.\n The darkness flowed around the two floor lights at the far end of the car, leaving the woman illuminated in outline only, a gunmetal reflection against pure blackness. Since he was first tapped as a Death Merchant, Minty had never remembered feeling afraid, but he was afraid now.\n \"I\u0027m not your lover,\" Minty said, his voice as smooth and steady as a bass sax, not giving up a note of fear. A crisis in every moment, he thought.\n \"Once you\u0027ve had black, you never go back,\" she said, taking a step toward him, her blue-black outline the only thing visible in any direction now.\n He knew there was a door a few feet behind him that was held shut with powerful hydraulics, and that led to a dark tunnel two hundred feet under the Bay, lined with a deadly electric rail - but for some reason, that sounded like a really friendly place to be right now.\n \"I\u0027ve had black,\" said Minty.\n \"No, you haven\u0027t, lover. You\u0027ve had shades of brown, dark cocoa and coffee maybe, but I promise you, you\u0027ve never had black. Because once you do, you never ever come back.\"\n He watched as she moved toward him - flowed toward him - and long silver claws sprouted from her fingertips, playing in the dim glow from the safety lights, dripping something that steamed when it hit the floor.

Even the harshest critic can\u0027t begrudge Christopher Moore his vivid imagination, satirical plots, and humor. Like a good sleight-of-hand artist, Moore builds up a huge reserve of goodwill to pull off his most demanding trick yet: laughing at death. The already-strained boundaries of his previous work (Lamb, an alternate history of Jesus\u0027s life; Bloodsucking Fiends, a vampire love story; and The Stupidest Angel, concerning the resurrection of Santa Claus) stretch even further to produce this tale that critics praise for its \"improbable humor\" (New York Times) and courage in \"embracing what we fear\" (Washington Post).\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-dirty-job.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-dirty-job.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:50 PM"}}
