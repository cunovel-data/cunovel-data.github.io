{"id":110048,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"8\\n\\n A STREETCAR NAMED CONFUSION\\n\\n Into the breech of the Castro district Charlie Asher charged, an antique sword-cane from the store on the van seat beside him, his jaw set like a bayonet, his visage a study in fearsome intensity. Half a block, half a block, half of a block onward - into the Valley of Overpriced Juice Bars and Outlandish Hair Highlights - rode the righteous Beta Male. And woe be unto the foolish ne\u0027er-do-well who had dared to fuck with this secondhand death dealer, for his raggedy life would be fast for the bargain table. There\u0027s going to be a showdown in Gay Town, Charlie thought, and I am gunning for justice.\\n\\n Well, not really gunning - since he had a sword concealed in a walking stick, not a gun - more of a poking for justice - which didn\u0027t really have the avenging angel connotation he was looking for - he was mad, and ready to kick ass, that\u0027s all. So, you know, just watch out. (Coincidentally, Poking for Justice was the title currently second in popularity at Castro Video Rentals, closely edging out A Star Is Born: The Director\u0027s Cut, and outranked only by Cops Without Pants, which was number one with a bullwhip.)\\n\\n Charlie turned off Market Street and just around the corner on Noe Street he saw it: Fresh Music, the sign done in blocky, Craftsman-style stained glass, and he felt the hair at the back of his neck bristle and an urgency in his bladder. His body had gone into fight-or-flight mode, and for the second time in a week, he was going against his Beta Male nature and choosing to fight. Well, so be it, he thought. So be it. He would confront his tormentor and lay him low, as soon as he found a parking place - which he didn\u0027t.\\n\\n He circled the block, cutting between caf��s and bars, both of which were in abundance in the Castro. He drove up and down the side streets, lined with rows of immaculately kept (exorbitantly priced) Victorians and found no quarter for his trusty steed. After a half hour of orbiting the neighborhood, he headed back uptown and found a spot in a parking garage in the Fillmore, then took the antique streetcar back down Market Street to the Castro. A cute little green, Italian-made antique streetcar, with oak benches, brass railings, and mahogany window frames - a charming brass bell and a top speed of about twenty miles per hour: this is how Charlie Asher charged into battle. He tried to imagine a horde of Huns hanging off the sides, waving wicked blades and firing arrows as they passed the murals in the Mission district, perhaps Viking raiders, shields fastened to the sides of the car, a great drum pounding as they rowed in to pillage the antique shops, the leather bars, the sushi bars, the leather sushi bars (don\u0027t ask), and the art galleries, in the Castro. And here, even Charlie\u0027s formidable imagination failed him. He got off the car at Castro and Market and walked back a block to Fresh Music, then paused outside the shop, wondering what in the hell he was going to do now.\\n\\n What if the caller had just borrowed the phone? What if he stormed in screaming and threatening, and there was just some confused kid behind the counter? But then he looked in the door, and there, standing behind the counter, all alone, was an extraordinarily tall black man dressed completely in mint green, and at that point Charlie lost his mind.\\n\\n \"You killed her,\" Charlie screamed as he stormed by the racks of CDs toward the man in mint. He drew the sword as he ran, or tried to, hoping to bring it out in a single fluid movement from the cane sheath and across the throat of Rachel\u0027s killer. But the sword-cane had been in the back of Charlie\u0027s shop for a long time, and except for three times when Lily\u0027s friend Abby tried to leave with it (once trying to buy it, when Charlie refused to sell it to her, then twice trying to steal it), the sword hadn\u0027t been drawn in years. The little brass stud that you pushed to release the blade had stuck, so when Charlie delivered the deathblow, he swung the entire cane, which was heavier - and slower - than the sword would have been. The man in mint green - quick for his size - ducked, and Charlie took out an entire row of Judy Garland CDs, lost his balance, bounced off the counter, spun around, and again tried for the single draw-and-cut move that he had seen so many times in samurai movies, and had practiced so many times in his head on the way here. This time the sword came free of the scabbard and slashed a deadly arch three feet in front of the man in mint, completely decapitating a life-sized cutout of Barbra Streisand.\\n\\n \"That is un-unfucking called for!\" thundered the tall man.\\n\\n As Charlie recovered his balance for a backhand slash, he saw something large and dark coming down over him and recognized it at the last instant, as the antique cash register slammed down on his head. There was a flash, a ding, and everything got dark and gooey.\\n\\n When Charlie came to, he was tied to a chair in the back room of the record store, which looked remarkably like the back room of his own store, except all the stacked boxes were full of records and CDs instead of all variety of used jetsam. The tall black man was standing over him, and Charlie thought at first that he might be turning to mist or smoke, but then he realized it was just that his vision was going wavy, and then pain lit up the inside of his head like a strobe light.\\n\\n \"Ouch.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027s your neck?\" asked the tall man. \"Does your neck feel broken? Can you feel your feet?\"\\n\\n \"Go ahead, kill me, you fucking coward,\" said Charlie, bucking around in the chair, trying to lunge at his captor and feeling a little like the Black Knight in Monty Python\u0027s Holy Grail after his arms and legs had been hacked off. If this guy took one step closer, Charlie could head-butt him in the nads, he was sure of it.\\n\\n The tall man stomped on Charlie\u0027s toes, a size-eighteen glove-leather loafer driven by two hundred and seventy pounds of death and used-record dealer.\\n\\n \"Ouch!\" Charlie hopped his chair in a little circle of pain. \"Goddammit! Ouch!\"\\n\\n \"So you do have feeling in your feet?\"\\n\\n \"Get it over with. Go ahead.\" Charlie stretched his neck as if offering his throat to be cut - his strategy was to lure his captor into range, then sever the tall man\u0027s femoral artery with his teeth, then gloat as the blood coursed all over his mint-green slacks onto the floor. Charlie would laugh long and sinister as he watched the life drain out of the evil bastard, then he would hop his chair out to the street and onto the streetcar at Market, transfer to the number forty-one bus at Van Ness, hop off at Columbus, and hop the two blocks home, where someone would untie him. He had a plan - and a bus pass with four more days left on it - so this son of a bitch had picked the wrong guy to fuck with.\\n\\n \"I have no intention of killing you, Charlie,\" said the tall man, keeping a safe distance. \"I\u0027m sorry I had to hit you with the register. You didn\u0027t really leave me any options.\"\\n\\n \"You could have tasted the fatal sting of my blade!\" Charlie glanced around for his sword-cane, just in case the guy had left it within reach.\\n\\n \"Yeah, sure, there was that one, but I thought I\u0027d go with the one without the stains and the funeral.\"\\n\\n Charlie strained against his bonds, which he realized now were plastic shopping bags. \"You\u0027re messing with Death, you know? I am Death.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know.\"\\n\\n \"You do?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\" The tall man spun another wooden chair around and sat on it reversed, facing Charlie. His knees were up at the level of his elbows and he looked like a great green tree frog, crouched to pounce on an insect. Charlie noticed for the first time that he had golden eyes, stark and striking in contrast to his dark skin. \"So am I,\" said the evil mint-green frog guy.\\n\\n \"You? You\u0027re Death?\"\\n\\n \"A Death, not THE Death. I don\u0027t think there is a THE Death. Not anymore, anyway.\"\\n\\n Charlie couldn\u0027t grasp it, so he struggled and wobbled until the tall man had to reach out and steady him to keep him from toppling over.\\n\\n \"You killed Rachel.\"\\n\\n \"I did not.\"\\n\\n \"I saw you there.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you did. That\u0027s a problem. Will you please stop thrashing around?\" He shook Charlie\u0027s chair. \"But I wasn\u0027t instrumental in Rachel\u0027s death. That\u0027s not what we do, not anymore, anyway. Didn\u0027t you even look at the book?\"\\n\\n \"What book? You said something about a book on the phone.\"\\n\\n \"The Great Big Book of Death. I sent it to your shop. I told a woman at the counter that I was sending it, and I got delivery confirmation, so I know it got there.\"\\n\\n \"What woman - Lily? She\u0027s not a woman, she\u0027s a kid.\"\\n\\n \"No, this was a woman about your age, with New Wave hair.\"\\n\\n \"Jane? No. She didn\u0027t say anything, and I didn\u0027t get any book.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, shit. That explains why they\u0027ve been showing up. You didn\u0027t even know.\"\\n\\n \"Who? What? They?\"\\n\\n Mint Green Death sighed heavily. \"I guess we\u0027re going to be here awhile. I\u0027m going to make some coffee. Do you want some?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, try to lull me into a false sense of security, then spring.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re tied the fuck up, motherfucker, I don\u0027t need to lull you into shit. You\u0027ve been fucking with the fabric of human existence and someone needed to shut your ass down.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, sure, go black on me. Play the ethnic card.\"\\n\\n Mint Green climbed to his feet and headed toward the door to the shop. \"You want cream?\"\\n\\n \"And two sugars, please,\" Charlie said.\\n\\n This is really cool, why are you giving it back?\" said Abby Normal. Abby was Lily\u0027s best friend, and they were sitting on the floor in the back room of Asher\u0027s Secondhand, looking through The Great Big Book of Death. Abby\u0027s real name was Alison, but she would no longer tolerate the ignominy of what she called her \"daylight-slave name.\" Everyone had been much more responsive to calling her by her chosen name than they had been to Lily\u0027s, Darquewillow Elventhing, which you always had to spell for people.\\n\\n \"Turns out it\u0027s Asher, not me,\" Lily said. \"He\u0027ll be really pissed if he finds out I took it. And he\u0027s Death now, I guess, so I could get in trouble.\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to tell him you had the book?\" Abby scratched the silver spider stud in her eyebrow; it was a fresh piercing and still healing and she couldn\u0027t stop messing with it. Abby, like Lily, was dressed all in black, boots to hair, the difference being that she had a black-widow\u0027s red hourglass on the front of her black T-shirt and she was thinner and more waiflike in her affected creepiness.\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027ll just say it got misfiled. That happens a lot here.\"\\n\\n \"How long did you think it was you?\"\\n\\n \"Like a month.\"\\n\\n \"What about the dreams and the names and stuff it talks about, you didn\u0027t have any of that, right?\"\\n\\n \"I thought I was just growing into my powers. I made a lot of lists of people I wanted gone.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I do that. And you just found out yesterday that it was Asher?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Lily.\\n\\n \"That sucks,\" said Abby.\\n\\n \"Life sucks,\" said Lily.\\n\\n \"So, what now?\" asked Abby. \"Junior college?\"\\n\\n They both nodded, woefully, and looked into the depths of their respective nail polishes to avoid sharing the humiliation of one of them having gone from dark demigod to local loser in an instant. They lived their lives hoping for something grand and dark and supernatural to happen, so when it had, they took it more in stride than was probably healthy. Fear, after all, is a survival mechanism.\\n\\n \"So all these things are soul objects?\" asked Abby, as cheerfully as her integrity would allow. She waved to the piles of stuff Charlie had marked with \"Do Not Sell\" signs. \"There\u0027s like a person\u0027s soul in there?\"\\n\\n \"According to the book,\" said Lily. \"Asher says he can see them glow.\"\\n\\n \"I like the red Converse All Stars.\"\\n\\n \"Take them, they\u0027re yours,\" said Lily.\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Lily said. She took the All Stars off the shelf and held them out. \"He\u0027ll never miss them.\"\\n\\n \"Cool. I have the perfect pair of red fishnets I can wear with them.\"\\n\\n \"They probably have the soul of some sweaty jock in them,\" Lily said.\\n\\n \"He may worship at my feet,\" said Abby, doing a pirouette and an arabesque (remnants, along with an eating disorder, of ten years of ballet lessons).\\n\\n So I\u0027m like a Santa\u0027s Helper of Death?!\" Charlie said, waving his coffee cup. The tall man had untied his one arm so he could drink his coffee, and Charlie was baptizing the stockroom floor with French roast with every gesture. Mr. Fresh frowned.\\n\\n \"What in the hell are you talking about, Asher?\" Fresh felt bad about hitting Charlie Asher with a cash register and tying him up, and now he was wondering if the blow hadn\u0027t caused some sort of brain damage.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m talking about the Santa at Macy\u0027s, Fresh. When you\u0027re a kid, and you notice that the Santa Claus at Macy\u0027s has a fake beard, and that there are at least six Salvation Army Santas working Union Square, you ask your parents about it and they tell you that the real Santa is in the North Pole, and he\u0027s really busy, so all these other guys are Santa\u0027s helpers, who are out helping him with his work. That\u0027s what you\u0027re saying, that we\u0027re Santa\u0027s helpers to Death?\"\\n\\n Mr. Fresh had been standing by his desk, but now he sat down again across from Charlie so he could look him in the eye. Very softly he said, \"Charlie, you know that that\u0027s not true now, right? I mean about Santa\u0027s helpers and all?\"\\n\\n \"Of course I know that there\u0027s no Santa Claus. I\u0027m using it as a metaphor, you tool.\"\\n\\n Mr. Fresh took this opportunity to reach out and smack Charlie upside the head. Then immediately regretted it.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" Charlie put down his cup and rubbed one of his receding-hairline inlets, which was going red from the blow.\\n\\n \"Rude,\" said Mr. Fresh. \"Let\u0027s not be rude.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re saying that there is a Santa?\" Charlie said, cringing in anticipation of another smack. \"Oh my God, how deep does this conspiracy go?\"\\n\\n \"No, there\u0027s no goddamn Santa. I\u0027m just saying that I don\u0027t know what we are. I don\u0027t know if there is a big Death with a capital D, although the book hints that there used to be. I\u0027m just saying that there are many of us, a dozen that I know of right here in the city - all of us picking up soul vessels and seeing that they get into the right hands.\"\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s based on someone randomly coming into your shop and buying a record?\" Then Charlie\u0027s eyes went wide as it hit him. \"Rachel\u0027s Sarah McLachlan CD. You took it?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Fresh looked at the floor, not because he was ashamed, but to avoid seeing the pain in Charlie Asher\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n \"Where is it? I want to see it,\" said Charlie.\\n\\n \"I sold it.\"\\n\\n \"To who? Find it. I want Rachel back.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. To a woman. I didn\u0027t get her name, but I\u0027m sure it was meant for her. You\u0027ll be able to tell.\"\\n\\n \"I will? Why will I?\" he asked. \"Why me? I don\u0027t want to kill people.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t kill people, Mr. Asher. That\u0027s a misconception. We simply facilitate the ascendance of the soul.\"\\n\\n \"Well, one guy died because I said something to him, and another had a heart attack because of something I did. A death that results from your actions is basically killing someone, unless you\u0027re a politician, right? So why me? I\u0027m not that highly skilled at bullshit. So why me?\"\\n\\n Mr. Fresh considered what Charlie was saying, and felt like something sinister had crawled up his spine. In all his years, he didn\u0027t remember ever having his actions directly result in someone\u0027s death, nor had he heard of it happening with the other Death Merchants. Of course you occasionally showed up at the time when the person was passing, but not often, and never as a cause.\\n\\n \"Well?\" Charlie said.\\n\\n Mr. Fresh shrugged. \"Because you saw me. Surely you\u0027ve noticed that no one sees you when you\u0027re out to get a soul vessel.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never gone out to get a soul vessel.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you have, and you will, at least you should be. You need to get with the program, Mr. Asher.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, so you said. So you\u0027re - uh - we\u0027re invisible when we\u0027re out getting these soul vessels?\"\\n\\n \"Not invisible, so to speak, it\u0027s just that no one sees us. You can go right into people\u0027s homes and they\u0027ll never notice you standing right beside them, but if you speak to someone on the street they\u0027ll see you, waitresses will take your order, cabs will stop for you - well, not me, I\u0027m black, but, you know, they would. It\u0027s sort of a will thing, I think. I\u0027ve tested it. Animals can see us, by the way. You\u0027ll want to watch out for dogs when you\u0027re retrieving a vessel.\"\\n\\n \"So that\u0027s how you got to be a - what do they call us?\"\\n\\n \"Death Merchants.\"\\n\\n \"Get out. Really?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not in the book. I came up with it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s very cool.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\" Mr. Fresh smiled, relieved for a moment not to be thinking about the gravity of Charlie\u0027s unique transition to Death Merchant. \"Actually, I think it\u0027s a character from an album cover, guy behind a cash register, eyes glowing red, but I didn\u0027t know that when I came up with it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it makes perfect sense.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I thought so,\" said Mr. Fresh. \"More coffee?\"\\n\\n \"Please.\" Charlie held out his empty cup. \"So, someone saw you. That\u0027s how you became a Death Merchant?\"\\n\\n \"No, that\u0027s how you became one. I think that you may, uh - \" Fresh didn\u0027t want to mislead this poor guy, but on the other hand he didn\u0027t actually know what had happened. \"I think you may be different from the rest of us. No one saw me. I was working security for a casino in Vegas when that went sour for me - I have a problem with authority, I\u0027m told - so I came to San Francisco and opened this shop, started dealing in used records and CDs, mostly jazz at first. After a while it just started happening: the glowing soul vessels, people coming in with them, finding them at estate sales. I don\u0027t know why or how, it just did, and I didn\u0027t say anything about it to anyone. Then the book came in the mail.\"\\n\\n \"The book again. Don\u0027t you have a copy around?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s only one copy. At least that I know of.\"\\n\\n \"And you just mailed it out?\"\\n\\n \"I sent it certified mail!\" Fresh boomed. \"Someone at your store signed for it. I think I did my part.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, sorry, go on.\"\\n\\n \"Anyway, when I got to the Castro it was a very sad place. The only guys you saw on the street were very old or very young, all the ones in the middle were either dead or sick with HIV, walking with canes, towing oxygen cylinders. Death was everywhere. It\u0027s like there needed to be a soul way station, and I was here, trading records. Then the book showed up in the mail. There were a lot of souls coming in. For those first few years I was picking up vessels every day, sometimes two or three times a day. You\u0027d be surprised how many gay men have their souls in their music.\"\\n\\n \"Have you sold them all?\"\\n\\n \"No. They come in, they go out. There\u0027s always some inventory.\"\\n\\n \"But how can you be sure the right person gets the right soul?\"\\n\\n \"Not my problem, is it?\" Mr. Fresh shrugged. He\u0027d worried about it at first, but it seemed to all happen as it should, and he\u0027d gotten into the rhythm of trusting whatever mechanism or power was behind all of this.\\n\\n \"Well, if that\u0027s your attitude, why do it at all? I don\u0027t want this job. I have a job, and a kid.\"\\n\\n \"You have to do it. Believe me, after I got the book, I tried not doing it. We all did. At least the ones I\u0027ve talked to did. I\u0027m guessing you\u0027ve already seen what happens if you don\u0027t. You\u0027ll start hearing the voices, then the shades start coming. The book calls them Underworlders.\"\\n\\n \"The giant ravens? Them?\"\\n\\n \"They were just indistinct shadows and voices until you showed up. There\u0027s something going on. Starting with you, and continuing with you. You let them get a soul vessel, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Me? You said there\u0027s a bunch of Death Merchants.\"\\n\\n \"The others know better. It was you. You fucked up. I thought I saw one flying over earlier in the week. Then today, I was out walking, and the voices were bad. Really bad. That\u0027s when I called you. It was you, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Charlie nodded. \"I didn\u0027t know. How could I know?\"\\n\\n \"So they got one?\"\\n\\n \"Two,\" Charlie said. \"A hand came out of the sewer. It was my first day.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s it,\" said Fresh, cradling his head in his hands. \"We are most certainly fucked now.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know that,\" Charlie said, trying to look on the bright side. \"We could have been fucked before. I mean, we run secondhand stores for dead people, that\u0027s sort of a definition of fucked.\"\\n\\n Mr. Fresh looked up. \"The book says if we don\u0027t do our jobs everything could go dark, become like the Underworld. I don\u0027t know what the Underworld is like, Mr. Asher, but I\u0027ve caught some of the road show from there a couple of times, and I\u0027m not interested in finding out. How \u0027bout you?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s Oakland,\" Charlie said.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s Oakland?\"\\n\\n \"The Underworld.\"\\n\\n \"Oakland is not the Underworld!\" Mr. Fresh leapt to his feet; he was not a violent man, you really didn\u0027t have to be when you were his size, but -\\n\\n \"The Tenderloin?\" Charlie suggested.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t make me smack you. Neither of us wants that, do we, Mr. Asher?\"\\n\\n Charlie shook his head. \"I\u0027ve seen the ravens,\" Charlie said, \"but I haven\u0027t heard any voices. What voices?\"\\n\\n \"They talk to you when you\u0027re on the street. Sometimes you\u0027ll hear a voice coming out of a heating vent, a downspout, sometimes a storm drain. It\u0027s them, all right. Female voices, taunting. I\u0027ve gone years without hearing them, I\u0027ll almost forget, then I\u0027ll be going to pick up a vessel, and one will call to me. I used to phone the other merchants, ask them if they\u0027d done something, but we stopped that right away.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because that\u0027s part of what we think brings them up. We\u0027re not supposed to have any contact. It took us a while to figure that out. I had only found six of the merchants in the city back then, and we were having lunch once a week, talking about what we knew, comparing notes - that\u0027s when we saw the first of the shades. In fact, just to be safe, this will be the last time that you and I have contact.\" Mr. Fresh shrugged again and began to untie Charlie\u0027s bonds, thinking: It all changed that day at the hospital. This guy has changed everything, and I\u0027m sending him out like a lamb to the slaughter - or maybe he\u0027s the one to do the slaughtering. This guy might be the one -\\n\\n \"Wait, I don\u0027t know anything,\" Charlie pleaded. \"You can\u0027t just send me out to do this without more background. What about my daughter? How do I know who to sell the souls to?\" He was panicked and trying to ask all the questions before he was set free. \"What are the numbers after the names? Do you get the names like that? How long do I have to do this before I can retire. Why are you always dressed in mint green?\" As Mr. Fresh untied one ankle, Charlie was trying to tie the other back to the chair.\\n\\n \"My name,\" said Mr. Fresh.\\n\\n \"Pardon?\" Charlie stopped tying himself up.\\n\\n \"I dress in mint green because of my first name. It\u0027s Minty.\"\\n\\n Charlie completely forgot what he was worried about. \"Minty? Your name is Minty Fresh?\"\\n\\n Charlie appeared to be trying to stifle a sneeze, but then snorted an explosive laugh. Then ducked. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dirty-job/page-8.html","bookId":2051,"book":{"id":2051,"title":"A Dirty Job","description":"Storyline: It\u0027s certainly original.
