{"id":110057,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"18 YO MOMMA SO DEAD THAT... On her last day, Lois Asher rallied. After not having even been able to get up to go to the breakfast table, or into the living room to sit and watch TV for three weeks, got up and danced with Buddy to an old Ink Spots song. She was playful and full of laughter, she teased her children and hugged them, she ate a chocolate-marshmallow sundae, and she brushed and flossed afterward. She put on her favorite silver jewelry and wore it to the dinner table, and when she couldn\u0027t find her squash-blossom necklace she shrugged it off like it was a minor thing - she must have misplaced it. Oh, well. Charlie knew what was happening because he had seen it before, and Buddy and Jane knew because Grace, the hospice nurse, explained it to them. \"It happens again and again. I\u0027ve seen people come out of a coma and sing their favorite songs, and all I can tell you is to enjoy it. People see the light come back into eyes that have been dull for months, and they start to place hope on it. It\u0027s not a sign of getting well, it\u0027s an opportunity to say good-bye. It\u0027s a gift.\" Charlie had also learned by observing that it really helped everyone to let go if they were at least mildly medicated, so he and Jane took some antianxiety pills that Jane\u0027s therapist had prescribed and Buddy washed down a time-released morphine pill with some scotch. Medication and forgiveness can make for joyous moments with the dying - it\u0027s like they get to return to childhood - and because nothing in the future matters, because you don\u0027t have to train them for life, teach lessons, forge applicable and practical memories, all the joy can be wicked from those last moments and stored in the heart. It was the best and closest time Charlie had ever had with his mother and his sister, and Buddy, in the sharing, became family as well. Lois Asher went to bed at nine and died at midnight. I can\u0027t stay for the funeral,\" Charlie said to his sister the next morning. \"What do you mean you can\u0027t stay for the funeral?\" Charlie looked out the window at the giant ice pick of a shadow that had made its way down the mountain toward his mother\u0027s house. Charlie could see it churning at the edges, like flocks of birds or swarming insects. The point was less than a half mile away. \"I have something I have to do at home, Jane. I mean, I forgot to do it and I really, really can\u0027t stay.\" \"Don\u0027t be mysterious. What the hell do you need to do that you can\u0027t attend your own mother\u0027s funeral?\" Charlie was pressing his Beta Male imagination to the breaking point to come up with something credible on the spot. Then a light went on. \"The other night, when you sent me out to get laid?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Well, it was an adventure, to be sure, but when I went to get my scalp sewed up, I also had a test. I talked to the doctor today, and I have to go get treatment. Right now.\" \"You moron, I didn\u0027t send you out to have unsafe sex. What were you thinking?\" \"It was safe sex.\" Right, sure, he thought, he almost scoffed at himself. \"It\u0027s the wounds they\u0027re worried about. But if I get on these drugs right away, there\u0027s a good chance that I\u0027ll be okay.\" \"They\u0027re putting you on the cocktail? As a preventative?\" Sure, that\u0027s it, the cocktail! Charlie thought. He nodded gravely. \"Okay, then, go.\" Jane turned and hid her face. \"Maybe I can get back in time for the funeral,\" Charlie said. Could he? He had to retrieve two overdue soul vessels in less than a week, and hope that no new names had appeared in his date book. \"We\u0027ll do it a week from today,\" Jane said, turning back around, tears blinked away. \"You go home, get treated, come back. Buddy and I will handle the arrangements.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Charlie said. He put his arms around his sister. \"Don\u0027t you die on me, too, you fucker,\" Jane said. \"I\u0027ll be fine. I\u0027ll be back as soon as I can.\" \"Bring back that charcoal Armani of yours for me to wear to the funeral, and Cassie\u0027s strappy black pumps, okay?\" \"You? In strappy black pumps?\" \"It\u0027s what Mom would have wanted,\" Jane said. When Charlie landed in San Francisco there were four frantic messages on his cell phone from Cassandra. She had always seemed so calm, composed - a stable counterpoint to his sister\u0027s flights of fancy. She sounded a wreck on the phone. \"Charlie, she\u0027s got him trapped and they\u0027re going to eat him and I don\u0027t know what to do. I don\u0027t want to call the cops. Call me when you land.\" Charlie did call, all the way into the city in the shuttle van he called, but kept getting transferred to voice messaging. When he got out of the van in front of his store he heard a hiss coming out of the storm drain at the corner. \"I missed finishing with you, lover,\" came the voice. \"No time,\" Charlie said, hopping over the curb and running into the store. \"You never called,\" purred the Morrigan. Ray was behind the counter mousing through Asian cuties when Charlie came storming through. \"You\u0027d better get upstairs,\" Ray said. \"They\u0027re freaking out up there.\" \"No kidding,\" Charlie said as he passed. He took the stairs two at a time. He was fumbling his key into the lock when Cassandra threw the door open and pulled him into his apartment. \"She won\u0027t let him go. I\u0027m afraid they\u0027re going to eat him.\" \"Who, what? That\u0027s what you said on my voice mail. Where is Sophie?\" Cassandra dragged him to Sophie\u0027s room, where he was met in the doorway by a growling Mohammed. \"Daddy!\" Sophie shrieked. She ran across the room and leapt into his arms. She gave him a big hug and a sloppy kiss that left a chocolate Sophie-print on his cheek. \"Down,\" she said. \"Down, down.\" Charlie put her down and she ran back into her room, but Mohammed prevented Charlie from entering, pushed his nose into Charlie\u0027s shirt, leaving a giant dog-nose print in chocolate. Evidently there had been a chocolate orgy going on in his absence. \"His mother is supposed to pick him up at one,\" Cassandra said. \"I don\u0027t know what to do.\" Charlie strained to see around the hellhound and saw Sophie standing with her hand on Alvin\u0027s collar while he menaced a little boy who was crouched in the corner. The little boy was a little wide-eyed, but otherwise unhurt, and he didn\u0027t seem that frightened. In fact, he was hugging a box of Crunchy Cheese Newts, and was eating one, then feeding the next one to Alvin, who was dripping hellish dog drool onto the kid\u0027s shoes in anticipation of the next newt. \"I love him,\" Sophie said. She went to the little boy and kissed him on the cheek, leaving a chocolate smear. Not the first. It appeared that this little guy had been suffering Sophie\u0027s affections for quite some time, for he was covered with chocolaty goodness and orange Cheese-Newt dust. \"I want to keep him.\" The little boy grinned. \"He came over for a playdate. I guess you scheduled it before you left,\" Cassandra said. \"I thought it would be okay. I tried to get him out of there, but the dogs won\u0027t let me by. What are we going to tell his mother?\" \"I want to keep him,\" Sophie said. Big kiss. \"His name is Matthew,\" Cassie said. \"I know his name. He goes to Sophie\u0027s school.\" Charlie started into the room. Mohammed blocked the doorway. \"Matty, are you all right?\" Charlie said. \"Uh-huh,\" said the chocolate-, cheese-, and dog-drool-sodden kid. \"I want him to stay, Dad,\" Sophie said. \"Alvin and Mohammed want him to stay, too.\" Charlie thought that perhaps he had not been strict enough in setting limits for his daughter. Maybe after losing her mother, he just hadn\u0027t had the heart to say no to her, and now she was taking hostages. \"Honey, Matty has to get cleaned up. His mommy is coming to get him so he can go be traumatized in his own house.\" \"No! He\u0027s mine.\" \"Honey, tell Mohammed to let me in. If we don\u0027t get Matty cleaned up, he won\u0027t be able to come back.\" \"He can sleep in your room,\" Sophie said. \"I\u0027ll take care of him.\" \"No, young lady, you tell Mohammed to get - \" \"I have to pee,\" Matthew said. He climbed to his feet and skipped by Alvin, who followed him, then under Mohammed and past Charlie and Cassandra to the bathroom. \"Hi,\" he said as he went by. He closed the door and they could hear the sound of tinkle. Alvin and Mohammed bullied their way through the doorway and waited outside the bathroom. Sophie sat down hard, her feet splayed out, her lower lip pushed out like the cowcatcher on a steam engine. Her shoulders started heaving before he could hear the sob - like she was saving up breath - then the wailing and the tears. Charlie went to her and picked her up. \"I�CI - I�CI, he - he - he - he - \" \"It\u0027s okay, honey. It\u0027s okay.\" \"But I love him.\" \"I know you do, honey. It\u0027ll be okay. He\u0027ll go to his house and you can still love him.\" \"Noooooooooooooooooooooo - \" She buried her face in his jacket, and as much as his heart was breaking for his daughter, he was also thinking about how much Three Fingered Wu was going to ding him for getting the chocolate stain out of his jacket. \"They just let him go pee,\" Cassandra said, staring at the hellhounds. \"Just like that. I thought they were going to eat him. They wouldn\u0027t let me near him.\" \"It\u0027s okay,\" Charlie said. \"You didn\u0027t know.\" \"Know what?\" \"They love the Crunchy Cheese Newts.\" \"You\u0027re kidding?\" \"Sorry. Look, Cassie, can you clean up Sophie and Matty and take care of this? I have some stuff in my date book I have to take care of right away.\" \"Sure, but - \" \"Sophie will be fine. Won\u0027t you, honey?\" Sophie nodded sadly and wiped her eyes on his coat. \"I missed you, Daddy.\" \"I missed you, too, sweetie. I\u0027ll be home tonight.\" He kissed her, got his date book from the bedroom, and ran around the apartment collecting his keys, cane, hat, and man purse. \"Thanks, Cassie. You have no idea how grateful I am.\" \"Sorry about your mother, Charlie,\" Cassandra said as he passed. \"Yeah, thanks,\" Charlie said, quickly checking the edge of the sword in his cane as he went by. \"Charlie, your life is out of control,\" Cassandra said, now slipping back into the unflappable persona that they were all used to. \"Okay, I\u0027ll need to borrow your strappy black pumps, too,\" Charlie said as he headed out the door. \"I think I\u0027ve made my point,\" Cassie called after him. Ray stopped Charlie at the bottom of the stairs. \"You got a minute, boss?\" \"Not really, Ray. I\u0027m in a hurry.\" \"Well, I just wanted to apologize.\" \"For what?\" \"Well, it seems silly now, but I kind of suspected you of being a serial killer.\" Charlie nodded as if he were considering the grave consequences of Ray\u0027s confession, when, in fact, he was trying to remember if there was any gas in the van. \"Well, Ray, I accept your apology, and I\u0027m sorry I ever gave you that impression.\" \"I think all those years on the force made me suspicious, but Inspector Rivera stopped by and set me straight.\" \"He did, did he? What exactly did he say?\" \"He said that you had been checking some stuff out for him, getting into places he couldn\u0027t get without a warrant and so forth, stuff that you\u0027d both get in a lot of trouble for if anyone found out, but was helping to put the bad guys away. He said that\u0027s why you\u0027re so secretive.\" \"Yes,\" Charlie said solemnly, \"I have been fighting crime in my spare time, Ray. I\u0027m sorry I couldn\u0027t tell you.\" \"I understand,\" Ray said, backing away from the stairway. \"Again, I\u0027m sorry. I feel like a traitor.\" \"It\u0027s okay, Ray. But I really have to go. You know, fighting the Forces of Darkness and all.\" Charlie held his cane out as if it were a sword and he was charging into action, which, bizarrely, it was and he was. Charlie had six days to retrieve three soul vessels if he was going to get caught up before he returned to Arizona for his mother\u0027s funeral. Two, the names that had appeared in his date book the same day as Madison McKerny were seriously overdue. The last had appeared in the book only a couple of days ago, when he was in Arizona - yet it was in his own handwriting. He\u0027d always thought that he had been doing some kind of sleep writing, but now, this was a whole new twist. He promised himself he would freak out about it as soon as he had some time. Meanwhile, with the near-death hand job and the dead-mom thing, he hadn\u0027t even done the preliminary research on the first of the two, Esther Johnson and Irena Posokovanovich, and both were now past their pickup date - one by three days. What if the sewer harpies had already gotten there? As strong as they\u0027d become already, he didn\u0027t even want to think about what they could do if they got hold of another soul. He considered calling Rivera to watch his back when he went to the house, but what would he say he was doing? The sharp-faced cop knew there was something supernatural going on, and he\u0027d taken Charlie\u0027s word that he was one of the good guys (not a hard sell when he\u0027d seen the sewer harpy driving a three-inch claw up his nostril only to survive nine rounds of 9 mm in the torso and still fly away). Charlie was driving with no destination, heading into Pacific Heights just because the traffic was lighter in that direction. He pulled over to the curb and called information. \"I need a number and address for an Esther Johnson.\" \"There\u0027s no Esther Johnson, sir, but I have three E. Johnsons.\" \"Can you give me the addresses?\" She gave him the two who had addresses. A recording offered to dial the number for him for an additional charge of fifty cents. \"Yeah, how much to drive me there?\" Charlie asked the computer voice. Then he hung up and dialed the E. Johnson with no address. \"Hi, could I speak with Esther Johnson,\" Charlie said cheerfully. \"There\u0027s no Esther Johnson here,\" said a man\u0027s voice. \"I\u0027m afraid you have the wrong number.\" \"Wait. Was there an Esther Johnson there, until maybe three days ago?\" Charlie asked. \"I saw the E. Johnson in the phone book.\" \"That\u0027s me,\" said the man, \"I\u0027m Ed Johnson.\" \"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Johnson.\" Charlie disconnected and dialed the next E. Johnson. \"Hello,\" a woman\u0027s voice. \"Hi, could I speak to Esther Johnson, please?\" A deep breath. \"Who is calling?\" Charlie used a ruse that had worked a dozen times before. \"This is Charlie Asher, of Asher\u0027s Secondhand. We\u0027ve taken in some merchandise that has Esther Johnson\u0027s name on it and we wanted to make sure it\u0027s not stolen.\" \"Well, Mr. Asher, I\u0027m sorry to tell you that my aunt passed away three days ago.\" \"Bingo!\" Charlie said. \"Pardon?\" \"Sorry,\" Charlie said. \"My associate is playing a scratch-off lotto ticket here in the shop, and he\u0027s just won ten thousand dollars.\" \"Mr. Asher, this isn\u0027t really a good time. Is this merchandise you have valuable?\" \"No, just some old clothes.\" \"Another time, then?\" The woman sounded not so much bereaved as harried. \"If you don\u0027t mind.\" \"No, I\u0027m sorry for your loss,\" Charlie said. He disconnected, checked the address, and headed up toward Golden Gate Park and the Haight. The Haight: mecca for the Free Love movement of the sixties, where the Beat Generation begat the Flower Children, where kids from all over the country had come to tune in, turn on, and drop out - and had kept coming, even as the neighborhood went through alternating waves of renewal and decline. Now, as Charlie drove down Haight Street, amid the head shops, vegetarian restaurants, hippie boutiques, music stores, and coffeehouses, he saw hippies that ranged in age from fifteen to seventy. Grizzled oldsters panhandling or passing out pamphlets, and young, white-Rastafarian dreadlocked teenagers in flowing skirts or hemp drawstring trousers, with shining piercings and vacant pot-blissed stares. He passed brown-toothed crackheads barking at cars as they passed, a spiky holdover here and there from the punk movement, old guys in berets and wayfarers who might have stepped out of a jazz club in 1953. It wasn\u0027t so much like the hands of time had stood still here, more like they\u0027d been thrown in the air in exasperation, the clock declaring, \"Whatever! I\u0027m outta here.\" Esther Johnson\u0027s house was just a couple of blocks off Haight, and Charlie was lucky enough to find parking in a twenty-minute green zone nearby. (If the time came that he ever got to talk to someone in charge, he was going to make a case for special parking privileges for Death Merchants, for while it was nice that no one could see him when he was retrieving a soul vessel, some cool Death plates or \"black\" parking zones would be even better.) The house was a small bungalow, unusual for this neighborhood, where most everything was three stories tall and painted in whatever color would contrast most with the house next to it. Charlie had taught Sophie her colors here, using grand Victorians as color swatches. \"Orange, Daddy. Orange.\" \"Yes, honey, the man barfed up orange. Look at that house, Sophie, it\u0027s purple.\" The block did have its share of transients, so he knew the doors of the Johnson house would be locked. Ring the bell and try to sneak through, or wait? He really couldn\u0027t afford to wait - the sewer harpies had hissed at him from a grate as he approached the house. He rang the bell, then quickstepped to the side. A pretty, dark-haired woman of about thirty, wearing jeans and a peasant blouse, opened the door, looked around, and said, \"Hello, can I help you?\" Charlie nearly fell through a window. He looked behind his back, then back at the woman. No, she was looking right at him. \"Yes, you rang the bell?\" \"Oh, me? Yes,\" Charlie said. \"I\u0027m, uh - you meant me, right?\" The woman stepped back into the house. \"What can I do for you?\" she said, a bit stern now. \"Oh, sorry - Charlie Asher - I own a secondhand store over in North Beach, I just talked to you on the phone, I think.\" \"Yes. But I told you that it wasn\u0027t important.\" \"Right, right, right. You did, but I was in the neighborhood, and I thought, well, I\u0027d just drop by.\" \"I got the impression you were calling from your shop. You got all the way across town in five minutes?\" \"Oh, right, well, the van is like a mobile shop to me.\" \"So the person who won the lotto is with you?\" \"Right, no, he quit. I had to kick him out of the van. New money, you know? All full of himself. Will probably buy a big rock of cocaine and a half-dozen hookers and he\u0027ll be broke by the weekend. Good riddance, I say.\" The woman backed another step into the house and pulled the door partway shut. \"Well, if you have the clothes with you, I suppose I can take a look at them.\" \"Clothes?\" Charlie couldn\u0027t believe she could see him. He was completely screwed now. He\u0027d never get the soul vessel and then - well, he didn\u0027t want to think of what would happen then. \"The clothes you said you thought might belong to my aunt. I could look at them.\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t have those with me.\" Now she had the door closed to the point where he could see just one blue eye, the embroidery around the neckline of her blouse, the button on her jeans, and two toes. (She was barefoot.) \"Maybe you\u0027d better check another time. I\u0027m trying to get my aunt\u0027s things together, and I\u0027m doing it all by myself, so it\u0027s a little hectic. She was in this house for forty-two years. I\u0027m overwhelmed.\" \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here,\" Charlie said, thinking, What the hell am I talking about? \"I do this all the time, uh, Ms. - \" \"Mrs., actually. Mrs. Elizabeth Sarkoff.\" \"Well, Mrs. Sarkoff, I do this sort of thing a lot, and sometimes it can get overwhelming going through the possessions of a loved one, especially if they\u0027ve been in one place for a long time like your aunt. It helps to have someone who doesn\u0027t have an emotional attachment to help sort things out. Plus, I have a pretty good eye for what\u0027s valuable and what\u0027s not.\" Charlie wanted to give himself a high five for coming up with that on the spur of the moment. \"And do you charge for this service?\" \"No, no, no, but I may make an offer to buy items you\u0027d like to get rid of, or you can place them in my shop on consignment if you\u0027d prefer.\" Elizabeth Sarkoff sighed heavily and hung her head. \"Are you sure? I wouldn\u0027t want to take advantage.\" \"It would be my pleasure,\" he said. Mrs. Sarkoff swung the door wide. \"Thank God you showed up, Mr. Asher. I just spent an hour trying to figure out which set of elephant salt-and-pepper shakers to keep and which to throw away. She has ten pairs! Ten! Please come in.\" Charlie sauntered through the door feeling very proud of himself. Six hours later, when he was waist deep in porcelain-cow figurines, and he still hadn\u0027t located the soul vessel, he lost all sense of accomplishment. \"So she had a special connection to Holsteins?\" Charlie called to Mrs. Sarkoff, who was in the next room, inside a walk-in closet, sorting through yet another huge pile of collectible crap. \"No, I don\u0027t think so. Lived her whole life here in the City. I\u0027m not sure if she ever saw a cow outside of those talking ones that sell cheese on TV.\" \"Swell,\" Charlie said. He\u0027d been through every inch of the house except the closet where Elizabeth Sarkoff was working and he hadn\u0027t found the soul vessel. He\u0027d peeked into the closet a couple of times, taking a fast inventory of the contents, and didn\u0027t see anything glowing red. He was starting to suspect that either he was too late, and the Underworlders had gotten the soul vessel, or it had been buried with Esther Johnson. He was heading down toward the basement again when his cell phone rang. \"Charlie Asher\u0027s phone,\" Charlie said. \"Charlie, it\u0027s Cassie. Sophie wants to know if you\u0027re going to come home in time to tell her a story and tuck her in. I gave her dinner and her bath.\" Charlie ran up the stairs and looked out the front windows. It had gotten dark and he hadn\u0027t even noticed. \"Crap, Cassie, I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t realize it was so late. I\u0027m with an estate client. Tell her I\u0027ll be home to tuck her in.\" \"Okay, I will,\" Cassandra said, sounding exhausted. \"And, Charlie, you can clean up the bathroom floor. You\u0027ve got to do something about those dogs getting in the tub with her. There are drifts of Mr. Bubble suds all over your apartment.\" \"They do enjoy their bath.\" \"That\u0027s cute, Charlie. If I didn\u0027t love your sister I\u0027d hire someone to break your legs.\" \"My mom just died, Cassie.\" \"You\u0027re playing the dead-mom card? Now? Charlie Asher, you - \" \"Gotta go,\" Charlie said. \"Be home soon.\" Charlie pushed the disconnect button four times, then one more time, just to be sure. Cassandra had been such a sweet woman, only days ago. What happened to people? Charlie bounded into the bedroom. \"Mrs. Sarkoff?\" \"Yes, still in here,\" came a voice from the closet. \"I\u0027m going to have to be going. My daughter needs me.\" \"I hope everything is all right.\" \"Yes, not an emergency, I\u0027ve just been gone for a couple of days. Look, if you need any more help - \" \"No, I wouldn\u0027t think of it. Why don\u0027t you give me a few days to sort things out and I\u0027ll bring some items by your shop.\" \"I don\u0027t mind, really.\" Charlie felt silly yelling to someone who was in a closet. \"No, I\u0027ll be in touch, I promise.\" Charlie couldn\u0027t think of any way of pressing the situation right now, and he needed to get home. \"Okay, then. I\u0027ll be going.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Asher. You\u0027ve been a lifesaver.\" \"You\u0027re welcome. Bye.\" Charlie let himself out and the front door locked behind him with a click. He could hear stirring below the street - the rustling of feathers, the distant calls of ravens - as he made his way back to where he had parked his van. And when he got there, of course, it had been towed. When she heard the front door lock, Audrey went to the back of the closet and moved the big cardboard wardrobe box aside to reveal an elderly woman who was sitting calmly in a folding lawn chair, knitting. \"He\u0027s gone, Esther. You can come out now.\" \"Well, help me up, dear, I think I\u0027m stuck like this,\" Esther said. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Audrey said. \"I had no idea he\u0027d stay that long.\" \"I don\u0027t understand why you let him in in the first place,\" Esther said, creaky but on her feet now. \"So he could satisfy his curiosity. See for himself.\" \"And where did you get that Elizabeth Sarkoff name?\" \"My second-grade teacher. It was the first thing I could think of.\" \"Well, I guess you fooled him. I don\u0027t know how to thank you.\" \"He\u0027ll be back. You know that, right?\" Audrey said. \"I hope not too soon,\" Esther said. \"I really need to visit the powder room.\" Where is it, lover?\" hissed the Morrigan from the grate on Haight Street, near where Charlie was trying to flag down a cab. \"You\u0027re slipping, Meat,\" said the hellish chorus. Charlie looked around to see if anyone else had heard, but passersby seemed very intent on their own conversations, or if alone, were staring intently at a point only twelve feet in front of them on the sidewalk, both strategies to avoid eye contact with the panhandlers and crazy people who lined the sidewalk. Not even the crazy people seemed to notice. \"Fuck off,\" Charlie said, in a furious whisper at the curb. \"Fucking harpies.\" \"Oh, lover, this teasing is so delicious. The little one\u0027s blood will be so delicious!\" The young homeless guy sitting just down the curb looked up at Charlie. \"Dude, get the clinic to up your lithium and they\u0027ll go away. It worked for me.\" Charlie nodded and gave the guy a dollar. \"Thanks, I\u0027ll look into that.\" He\u0027d have to call Jane in Arizona in the morning and find out how far the shadow had moved down the mesa, if it had moved. Why would what he did or didn\u0027t do in San Francisco affect what was happening in Sedona? All this time he\u0027d been trying to convince himself that it wasn\u0027t about him, and now it appeared that it very much was about him. The Luminatus will rise in the City of Two Bridges, Vern had said. What kind of dependable prophecy can you get from a guy named Vern, anyway? (Come on down to Vern\u0027s Discount Prophecy - The Nostradamus with the Low-Price Promise.) It was absurd. He had to keep going forward, doing his part, and doing his best to collect the soul vessels that came to him. And if he didn\u0027t, well, the Forces of Darkness would rise and rule over the world. So what. Bring it on, sewer hoes! Big deal. But his inner Beta Male, the gene that had kept his kind alive for three million years, spoke up: Forces of Darkness ruling the world? Okay, that would be bad, it said. She so loved the smell of Pine-Sol,\" said the third woman that day to claim to have been Charlie\u0027s mother\u0027s best friend. The funeral hadn\u0027t been so bad, but now there was a potluck in the clubhouse of a nearby gated senior community where Buddy had lived before he moved in with Charlie\u0027s mom. The couple had returned there often to play cards and socialize with Buddy\u0027s old crew. \"Did you get some sloppy joe?\" asked best friend number three. Despite the hundred-degree heat, she wore a pink sweatsuit emblazoned with rhinestone poodles and carried a nervous little black poodle under her arm everywhere she went. The dog licked her potato salad while she was distracted by talking to Charlie. \"I don\u0027t know if your mother ever ate sloppy joe. Only thing I ever saw her take in was an old-fashioned. She did enjoy her cocktails.\" \"Yes, she did,\" Charlie said. \"And I think I\u0027m going to go enjoy one myself, right now.\" Charlie had flown into Sedona that morning after spending the night in San Francisco trying to find the two overdue soul vessels. Although he couldn\u0027t find a burial notice for Esther Johnson, the pretty brunette woman at her house had told him that she had been interred the day after he\u0027d first gone to the house in the Haight, and he assumed that the soul vessel had been, once again, buried with her. (Was the brunette\u0027s name Elizabeth? Of course it was Elizabeth, he was fooling himself to even pretend to forget. Beta Males do not forget the names of pretty women. Charlie could remember the name of the centerfold of the first Playboy he\u0027d ever swiped from the shelves in his dad\u0027s shop. He even remembered that her turnoffs were bad breath, mean people, and genocide, and resolved that he would never have, be, or commit any of those things, just in case he ran into her sometime when she was casually sunning her breasts on the hood of a car.) There was no trace of the other woman, Irena Posokovanovich, who was supposed to have died days ago. No notice, no records at hospitals, no one living in her house. It was as if she\u0027d evaporated, and taken her soul vessel with her. He had a couple more weeks to get to the third name in his date book, but he wasn\u0027t sure what he was going to have to deal with to get to it. Darkness was rising. Someone beside him said, \"Small talk doesn\u0027t really get any smaller than when you\u0027ve lost a loved one, huh?\" Charlie turned toward the voice, surprised to see Vern Glover, diminutive Death Merchant, munching some coleslaw and ranch beans. \"Thanks for coming,\" Charlie said automatically. Vern waved off the thanks with his plastic fork. \"You saw the shadow?\" Charlie nodded. When he\u0027d gotten to his mother\u0027s house this morning, the shadow of the mesa had reached his mother\u0027s front yard, and the calls of the carrion birds that churned in its edges were deafening. \"You didn\u0027t tell me that no one else could see it. I called my sister from San Francisco to check the progress, but she didn\u0027t see anything.\" \"Sorry, they can\u0027t see it - at least as far as I\u0027ve ever been able to tell they can\u0027t. It was gone for five days. It came back this morning.\" \"When I came back?\" \"I guess. Did we cause this? Doughnuts and coffee and it\u0027s the end of the world?\" \"I missed two souls back home,\" Charlie said, smiling at a gentleman in burgundy golf wear who held his hand to his heart in sympathy as he passed them. \"Missed? Did the - what did you call them - the sewer harpies get them?\" \"Could be,\" Charlie said. \"But whatever is happening, it seems to be following me.\" \"Sorry,\" Vern said. \"I\u0027m glad we talked, though. I don\u0027t feel so alone.\" \"Yeah,\" Charlie said. \"And sorry about your mother,\" Vern added quickly. \"You okay?\" \"Hasn\u0027t even hit me yet,\" Charlie said. \"I guess I\u0027m an orphan.\" \"I\u0027ll make sure and check out whoever gets her necklace,\" Vern said. \"I\u0027ll be careful with it.\" \"Thanks,\" Charlie said. \"You think we have any control over who gets the soul next? I mean really. The Great Big Book says it will move on as it should.\" \"I guess,\" Vern said. \"Every time I\u0027ve sold one the glow has gone out right away. If it wasn\u0027t the right person, that wouldn\u0027t happen, right?\" \"Yeah, I guess so,\" Charlie said. \"So there is some order to this.\" \"You\u0027re the expert,\" Vern said - then he dropped his fork. \"Who is that? She\u0027s so hot.\" \"That\u0027s my sister,\" Charlie said. Jane was coming across the room toward them. She was wearing Charlie\u0027s charcoal double-breasted Armani and the strappy black pumps; her platinum hair was lacquered into thirties finger waves, which flowed out from under a small black hat with a veil that covered her face down to her lips, which shone like red Ferraris. To Charlie, she looked, as usual, like the cross between a robot assassin and a Dr. Seuss character, but if he tried to squint past the fact that she was his sister, and a lesbian, and his sister, then he could possibly see how the hair, lips, and sheer linear altitude of her might strike someone as hot. Especially someone like Vern, who would require climbing equipment and oxygen to scale a woman Jane\u0027s height. \"Vern, I\u0027d like you to meet my incredibly hot sister, Jane. Jane, this is Vern.\" \"Hi, Vern.\" Jane took Vern\u0027s hand and the Death Merchant winced at her grip. \"Sorry for your loss,\" Vern said. \"Thanks,\" Jane said. \"Did you know our mother?\" \"Vern knew her very well,\" Charlie said. \"In fact, it was one of Mom\u0027s dying wishes that you let Vern buy you a doughnut. Wasn\u0027t it, Vern?\" Vern nodded so hard that Charlie thought he could hear vertebrae cracking. \"Her dying wish,\" Vern said. Jane didn\u0027t move, or say anything. Because her eyes were covered, Charlie couldn\u0027t see her expression, but he guessed that she might be trying to burn holes in his aorta with her laser-beam vision. \"You know, Vern, that would be lovely, but could I take a rain check? We just buried my mother and I have some things to go over with my brother.\" \"That\u0027s fine,\" Vern said. \"And it doesn\u0027t have to be a doughnut, if you\u0027re watching your figure. You know, a salad, coffee, anything.\" \"Sure,\" Jane said. \"Since it\u0027s what Mom wanted. I\u0027ll give you a call. Charlie told you I\u0027m a lesbian, though, right?\" \"Oh my God,\" Vern said. He almost doubled over with excitement before he remembered that he was at a postfuneral potluck and he was openly imagining a m��nage �� trois with the deceased\u0027s daughter. \"Sorry,\" he squealed. \"See you, Vern,\" Charlie said as his sister hustled him toward the kitchen cubicle of the clubhouse. \"I\u0027ll e-mail you about that other thing.\" As soon as they rounded the corner into the kitchen Jane punched Charlie in the solar plexus, knocking the wind out of him. \"What were you thinking?\" Jane hissed. She flipped back her veil so he could see just how pissed off she was, just in case the punch in the breadbasket hadn\u0027t conveyed the message. Charlie was gasping and laughing at the same time. \"It\u0027s what Mom would have wanted.\" \"My mom just died, Charlie.\" \"Yeah,\" Charlie said. \"But you have no idea what you\u0027ve just done for that guy in there.\" \"Really?\" Jane raised an eyebrow. \"He will remember this day always,\" Charlie said. \"That guy will never again have a sexual fantasy in which you do not walk through, probably wearing borrowed shoes.\" \"And you don\u0027t find that creepy?\" \"Well, yes, you\u0027re my sister, but it\u0027s a seminal moment for Vern.\" Jane nodded. \"You\u0027re a pretty good guy, Charlie, looking out for a tiny stranger like that.\" \"Yeah, well, you know - \" \"For an ass bag!\" Jane said as she sank a fist into Charlie\u0027s solar plexus. Strangely, as he gasped for breath, Charlie felt that wherever his mother was right now, she was pleased with him. Bye, Mom, he thought.

Even the harshest critic can\u0027t begrudge Christopher Moore his vivid imagination, satirical plots, and humor. Like a good sleight-of-hand artist, Moore builds up a huge reserve of goodwill to pull off his most demanding trick yet: laughing at death. The already-strained boundaries of his previous work (Lamb, an alternate history of Jesus\u0027s life; Bloodsucking Fiends, a vampire love story; and The Stupidest Angel, concerning the resurrection of Santa Claus) stretch even further to produce this tale that critics praise for its \"improbable humor\" (New York Times) and courage in \"embracing what we fear\" (Washington Post).","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-dirty-job.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-dirty-job.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:50 PM"}}
