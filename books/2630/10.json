As soon as she appeared, her mother waved to catch her attention. Beth felt wonderful and couldn\u0027t have disguised her mood had she tried. \"Hello, Mom,\" she said, giving her mother a quick hug. \"I took the liberty of ordering for you, dear. I just got two of what we usually order.\" \"That\u0027s fine.\" Beth only had an hour for lunch and although she would\u0027ve liked to try something new rather than her standard soup du jour and turkey sandwich, she didn\u0027t object. Taking off her coat, Beth draped it over her chair. \"You\u0027re positively glowing. What\u0027s going on?\" Her mother looked like she was about to rub her hands together in glee. \"Is it that young man from the computer game?\" \"We\u0027re going to meet.\" Beth wasn\u0027t sure how and why the situation had changed. Just as she was losing hope that they\u0027d ever take a chance, Peter had stepped forward. Without understanding why it had happened, she realized that a transformation had taken place. They\u0027d logged on to play World of Warcraft last night and after a while had started exchanging messages again. In the beginning it wasn\u0027t anything special, just their normal chitchat. Then out of the blue Peter had made a startling admission. \"He\u0027s divorced,\" Beth informed her mother. \"Well, dear, so are you.\" \"I know...That\u0027s not the point. Peter and I were talking.\" \"On the phone?\" \"No, no, online. That\u0027s the only way we\u0027ve communicated so far.\" Her mother frowned, then decided not to make whatever comment hovered on the tip of her tongue. \"Go on,\" she urged instead. \"I want to hear everything.\" \"Well,\" Beth said, eager now. \"He told me that it\u0027s taken him some time to get over the divorce, but he thinks he\u0027s ready to move on.\" \"How long has it been?\" her mother asked. \"I mean, since his divorce was final.\" Beth frowned. Her mother was right; that was an important question. \"I didn\u0027t ask him.\" \"You should, dear. If it\u0027s been less than a year, it might be best to move slowly and carefully in this relationship.\" Then, as if she regretted having given advice, she shook her head. \"Follow your heart. Don\u0027t listen to a thing I say.\" Beth thought cynically that this was all part of the wager her parents had. Her mother didn\u0027t care if Peter was the brother of Frankenstein\u0027s monster as long as he showed up. \"You really want him there for Christmas, don\u0027t you?\" Her mother\u0027s eyes brightened. \"Is there any possibility that might happen?\" Beth shrugged. Despite her mother\u0027s bet - and personally she felt Joyce deserved to lose - she\u0027d like it if Peter could spend Christmas with her. She wanted to invite him, but it was a lot to ask of someone she hadn\u0027t even met. Everything depended on this weekend. Her mother waved one hand impatiently. \"So you told him you\u0027re divorced, too?\" \"Yes, of course, and then we both started talking so fast it was hard for my fingers to keep up with my thoughts.\" Peter had been deeply hurt by his wife, who\u0027d more or less kicked him out of the house and excluded him from her life. It\u0027d been painful and harsh, and he\u0027d taken the breakup of his marriage hard. Beth understood. She\u0027d experienced the same grief over the death of her own marriage. In the course of their conversation, they\u0027d talked about regrets and all the things they might\u0027ve done to save their marriages. Based on the few details Peter had divulged, Beth regarded his ex-wife as cold and calculating. She talked about John in ways she never had with anyone else, including her parents. It was as though a festering blister had burst inside her and she spewed out the devastating pain of her own divorce. The game was forgotten as they continued talking. It was after midnight when Peter reminded her that they both needed to be at work in the morning. Reluctantly Beth had signed off. \"What else did he say?\" her mother asked. \"Did you tell him your real name is Marybeth?\" \"Hardly,\" she cried, annoyed that her mother would ask such an inane question. \"And don\u0027t you tell him, either.\" \"So you did invite him for Christmas?\" Her mother looked pleased beyond measure. \"No...not yet.\" The optimism Beth felt was a sign of her excitement about the way their relationship was developing. No man had interested her this much since college, when she\u0027d first met John. Peter gave her hope. Maybe this wouldn\u0027t go anywhere, but at least she was finally taking a risk. Finally willing to try again. The server brought their lunches, giving Beth a respite from her mother\u0027s relentless questioning. She tasted her cream of broccoli soup, and it took a few minutes for the conversation to return to Peter. \"You do expect to introduce him to your family, don\u0027t you?\" Her mother smiled expectantly at Beth, the turkey sandwich poised in front of her mouth. \"If things go well.\" She nodded. \"We have a lot in common, Peter and me.\" \"That\u0027s wonderful, dear.\" Beth felt the giddy sensation of everything coming together at last. \"I never dreamed that after all these months we\u0027d connect the way we have.\" \"Well?\" Her mother paused. \"When are you going to meet?\" Before Beth could answer, she added, \"Soon, I hope.\" \"Is tomorrow soon enough for you?\" \"Saturday? But I thought you were going to Leavenworth with Heidi.\" \"I am.\" \"You\u0027re meeting Peter there?\" Beth nodded. Peter seemed to be a closet romantic, although she suspected he\u0027d never admit it. He was the one who\u0027d wanted to have this initial meeting right away. He\u0027d mentioned getting together on Saturday for lunch, and Beth had said she\u0027d be in Leavenworth. Undeterred, Peter had suggested meeting there. \"But how will that work when you don\u0027t know what he looks like? Good grief, Beth, do you have any idea how crowded that town can get, especially this time of year?\" \"We\u0027ve got it all figured out. Heidi and Sam and I are taking the train with the kids and - \" \"Peter will meet you on the train?\" her mother broke in. \"Not exactly. The train sold out weeks ago, so Peter\u0027s taking the bus. We arrive at eleven and, depending on the weather, he should get in around noon.\" \"The train\u0027s always late.\" \"Oh, ye of little faith.\" \"I have a lot of faith,\" her mother said. \"But I happen to be practical, too.\" \"We took that into consideration, Mother. The bus could be late, too, you know.\" \"Yes, of course.\" \"We\u0027re meeting by the gazebo in the center of town at four o\u0027clock.\" \"Why not earlier?\" her mother demanded. Beth sighed. \"I\u0027m there to spend the day with Heidi, remember? Besides, if this doesn\u0027t work out...\" \"Fine,\" Joyce said dismissively. \"But how will you recognize each other?\" Beth described their plan. Peter would be carrying a single long-stemmed red rose and wearing a baseball cap with a Seahawks emblem. She, meanwhile, would be wearing a full-length navy wool coat and a red knit hat and muffler. They should be able to find each other without difficulty. Then they\u0027d watch the tree-lighting ceremony together. The train was scheduled to depart at six-thirty; his bus would leave shortly after that. They\u0027d spend just a couple of hours in each other\u0027s company - a safe length of time whether the meeting went well or not. He hadn\u0027t said so, but Beth had the distinct feeling that if this meeting did go well, Peter would ask to see her again on Sunday. \"You sound so hopeful,\" her mother said. \"I am.\" Beth had a positive feeling about this. \"What if...what if Peter isn\u0027t as good-looking as you expect?\" She seemed genuinely concerned that this might be a possibility. \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\" John had been drop-dead gorgeous. She\u0027d been the envy of all her friends, and what she\u0027d discovered was that good looks made very little difference. Most important was character. Moral fiber, sense of honor and kindness were far more compelling qualities in Beth\u0027s eyes. \"You say that now,\" her mother warned, \"but you might change your mind once you meet him.\" \"Perhaps.\" But even as she said it, Beth was convinced that her feelings wouldn\u0027t change. If there was anything she\u0027d learned from her divorce, it was that looks could be deceiving. John had been completely self-absorbed, selfish, irresponsible.... It was pointless to rehash his shortcomings, of which there\u0027d been plenty. They finished their lunch and because she had a few minutes to spare, Beth and her mother did some window-shopping. Seattle was a magical city at Christmastime. Beth loved the festive air - the decorations everywhere, the cheerful crowds, the music. Entertainers sang and played instruments. She and Joyce stopped to listen to a violinist whose rendition of \"Silent Night\" was exquisite as people bustled to and from stores with their bags and packages. The cold wind stung her face and she glanced up at the sky for any sign of snow. Her step was lighter and for the first time in years she felt a rush of joyful anticipation about Christmas. Her mother wasn\u0027t the only one to notice her improved mood. Lloyd, the attorney who\u0027d introduced her to the World of Warcraft, commented on it when she returned from lunch. \"You seem to be mighty happy about something,\" he said, smiling at her. \"I am,\" she responded cryptically. At closing time, she hurried home. As soon as she was back in her condo, Beth logged online, hoping Peter would be there. He was. Did you have a good day? he typed. Great. What about you? He didn\u0027t reply immediately. It couldn\u0027t have been better, he eventually wrote. Thank you for listening while I poured out my woes about my marriage last night. I don\u0027t often talk about it. I wouldn\u0027t have with you, but in all fairness I felt you needed to know. Peter, thank you, she hurriedly typed back. I can\u0027t tell you how freeing it was for me to tell you about my divorce. It\u0027s not a subject I bring up lightly. I felt like such a failure when we split up and that feeling never went away. I know. That\u0027s how I felt when my marriage ended, too. It seems we have even more in common than we realized, she told him. I was thinking the same thing. They chatted for most of an hour until Beth\u0027s stomach growled, reminding her that she hadn\u0027t eaten dinner. Peter couldn\u0027t stay online long because he was seeing a friend, so they ended their conversation. It was just as well, because Beth had to call Heidi and let her friend know there\u0027d been a small change in plans. After she reached her, Beth explained that she\u0027d be seeing Peter in Leavenworth and said she hoped Heidi didn\u0027t mind. \"Mind? Of course I don\u0027t mind,\" Heidi told her. \"I think it\u0027s so romantic that you two will meet up there. All we need now is some snow for the day to be absolutely perfect.\" Snow in Santa\u0027s Village - that would indeed be marvelous. \"I wonder if I\u0027m expecting too much,\" she said, suddenly anxious. \"How can you help it?\" Heidi asked. \"He does seem too good to be true.\" No dating service could have set her up with a more suitable candidate. They agreed on practically everything they\u0027d discussed. In the past week, Beth had learned that they both read the same books, liked the same kinds of food - Mexican and Chinese - and adored anchovies on Caesar salad but not pizza. Granted, those might be superficial similarities, but unlike John, Peter was responsible and dedicated, both qualities she admired. She knew this from his loyalty to his friends, his seriousness about his career - as a coffee buyer at Starbucks - his affection toward his parents and many other examples she\u0027d gleaned. Maybe he was too good to be true, as Heidi had said. But Beth\u0027s instincts told her that Peter was a man she wanted to know better, a man worth knowing better. Not that her instincts had been what you\u0027d call reliable in the past. So, before things went any further, she had to learn if this could become a viable relationship - and there was only one way to find out. In other words, Beth was counting on their face-to-face meeting to tell her whether these feelings for Peter were real - or just a fantasy concocted during their online adventures.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/where-angels-go-angels-everywhere-6/page-10.html","bookId":2630,"book":{"id":2630,"title":"Where Angels Go (Angels Everywhere #6)","description":"Storyline: Where Angels Go (Angels Everywhere #6) Christmas is a time for angel.
