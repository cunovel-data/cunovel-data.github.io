I don\u0027t have a clue where that dog came from. Trust me, if I brought a dog into Carter\u0027s life, it wouldn\u0027t be that mangy mutt.\"\\n\\n Mercy didn\u0027t believe her. \"I, for one, find it mighty convenient that a stray dog should show up in the schoolyard today.\" And besides, she knew Shirley loved animals - despite the scornful way she\u0027d spoken about this dog.\\n\\n \"I agree with Mercy.\" Goodness came to stand at her side, her foot tapping in an identical tempo.\\n\\n \"Stop looking at me like that,\" Shirley muttered. \"Carter can\u0027t have a dog. That decision\u0027s already been made. You both know I can\u0027t interfere with the chain of command. Carter\u0027s father feels bad enough as it is, but he\u0027s said in no uncertain terms that his son can\u0027t have a dog. Why would I complicate matters?\"\\n\\n \"Why would she?\" Goodness turned to Mercy.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, but like I said, I find this entire situation a little too convenient.\"\\n\\n Shirley stepped free of the swing and brushed the snow from her hands. \"Speaking of convenient, I think it\u0027s very interesting that Beth and Peter appear to be so well-matched.\"\\n\\n Goodness raised both arms. \"Don\u0027t look at me. I didn\u0027t have a thing to do with that. They met online six months ago, remember?\"\\n\\n \"Quite right,\" Mercy confirmed. \"And before you mention Harry and Rosalie running into Lucy Menard, I\u0027ve explained that.\"\\n\\n A wistful expression came over Goodness. \"I do hope everything works out for Beth and Peter.\"\\n\\n \"Why shouldn\u0027t it?\" Shirley asked.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re both so stubborn - and so scared. What they need is a good shove in the right direction.\"\\n\\n \"Goodness!\" Shirley\u0027s expression was scandalized. \"Don\u0027t even think like that. Our job is to teach these humans a lesson. They have to make their own decisions, find their own way.\"\\n\\n \"Find their own way?\" Mercy didn\u0027t mean to sound sarcastic, but she couldn\u0027t help it. The evidence was overwhelming; humans were a pathetic bunch. \"May I remind you that humans wandered in the desert for forty years on a trip that should\u0027ve taken three months, tops?\"\\n\\n \"Joshua had them march around Jericho seven times, looking for the main gate to the city,\" Goodness added, shaking her head.\\n\\n Shirley frowned. \"You both know there were very good reasons for those incidents.\"\\n\\n \"True, but you have to admit humans don\u0027t exactly have an impressive track record.\"\\n\\n With a disgruntled look, Shirley was forced to admit the truth.\\n\\n \"Humans need help,\" Mercy reiterated.\\n\\n \"Our help.\"\\n\\n Still Shirley didn\u0027t seem convinced. \"But Gabriel - \"\\n\\n \"Will never find out,\" Mercy assured her. \"We won\u0027t be blatant about it - just a nudge or two where it\u0027s warranted. If Gabriel\u0027s going to place us under earthly time constraints, we need to be inventive.\"\\n\\n \"Inventive,\" Goodness echoed. \"How do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Well, for one thing, it\u0027s obvious that you\u0027ll have to step in with Beth and Peter.\"\\n\\n \"I will?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Mercy didn\u0027t understand why she had to clarify everything for her fellow Prayer Ambassadors. \"Didn\u0027t you tell me they still haven\u0027t set a time to meet?\"\\n\\n \"Well, yes...\"\\n\\n \"And the reason is?\"\\n\\n Goodness shifted uncomfortably. \"Well, like I said, they\u0027re afraid....\"\\n\\n \"Afraid of what?\" Mercy asked. \"Do you suppose maybe they\u0027re afraid of being disillusioned?\"\\n\\n \"They could be,\" Goodness said. \"And I agree - they need help. The last time I looked, Beth was depressed. Everything was going so well between her and Peter, and then he closed down for no apparent reason.\"\\n\\n \"Is there anything you can do about it?\"\\n\\n \"I...Yes, of course there is.\" Her eyes darted from side to side. \"Unfortunately, I can\u0027t think what it would be at this precise moment, but it\u0027ll come to me.\"\\n\\n \"Shirley.\" Mercy focused her gaze on the former guardian angel.\\n\\n \"Reporting for duty.\" She stood military straight, wings neatly folded, feet together. Mercy wondered if Shirley was making fun of her.\\n\\n \"How do you plan to help Carter?\" she asked.\\n\\n Shirley\u0027s shoulders sagged with defeat. \"I\u0027ll make sure the dog\u0027s nowhere to be seen when he arrives for school tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sure that\u0027s the right thing for Carter?\" Mercy asked, her own heart aching for the little boy.\\n\\n Reluctantly Shirley nodded. \"His father said he couldn\u0027t have a dog, no matter what. I don\u0027t have any choice.\"\\n\\n All three considered this unfortunate set of circumstances.\\n\\n \"Maybe I could steer Carter\u0027s father toward a better-paying job,\" Shirley suggested.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s an idea.\"\\n\\n Goodness turned to her. \"What\u0027s happening with Harry?\" she asked.\\n\\n Ah, yes, Harry and Rosalie. \"They visited Lucy Menard earlier this afternoon and got a tour of the assisted-living complex.\"\\n\\n \"And what happened?\" Shirley asked.\\n\\n \"Come with me and let\u0027s find out,\" Mercy invited. Together with her two friends, she descended on the house at 23 Walnut Avenue, where Rosalie and Harry sat across from each other at the dinner table.\\n\\n \"I was surprised at how many of our friends have moved to Liberty Orchard,\" Rosalie murmured, gazing down at her bowl of canned chicken stew.\\n\\n She seemed deep in thought, and that encouraged Harry. The visit had gone even better than he could\u0027ve expected. Rosalie had met three good friends she\u0027d lost contact with in the last few years. Each one had urged them to make the change and become part of the community at Liberty Orchard.\\n\\n \"Did you notice how most people said they were sorry they hadn\u0027t moved into assisted living sooner?\" Harry waited for his wife to protest. She hadn\u0027t wanted him to know, but he could see that she\u0027d been impressed with the facility.\\n\\n \"What I liked was all the social activities,\" Rosalie murmured.\\n\\n Harry agreed. He\u0027d been impressed himself, glad, too, because he felt that after he died Rosalie would have the social contact she needed. A wave of sadness washed over him at the thought of leaving his wife behind. He tried not to dwell on the subject of death, but knowing it was imminent, he couldn\u0027t stop thinking about it.\\n\\n Trying not to appear too enthusiastic about the assisted-living complex, Harry nodded.\\n\\n \"My goodness,\" Rosalie said happily, \"those folks have something going on every day of the week.\"\\n\\n Harry nodded again, taking a bite of his stew.\\n\\n \"Did you read the dinner menu?\" Rosalie asked him. She\u0027d found it posted outside the dining room and gone over it three or four times. She\u0027d had all kinds of questions for Lucy, too. The midday meal was the main one of the day, with a lighter one served at about five. \"Why, they had a choice of two soups and a salad, plus fish, chicken or meat loaf. And Lucy said it\u0027s different every day!\"\\n\\n \"I took a look at it myself,\" Harry said gently. One thing was certain; the residents at Liberty Orchard weren\u0027t eating any of their meals out of a can - unless they chose to. He didn\u0027t need to point out the obvious, however.\\n\\n His wife set down her spoon. \"Harry,\" she began shyly, \"I\u0027m not sure if you\u0027ve noticed, but I\u0027m starting to forget things now and then.\" The admission came with some hesitation. \"I\u0027ve begun to wonder if one of the reasons is that my mind isn\u0027t as active as it used to be.\"\\n\\n \"Lucy said the same thing happened to her,\" Harry pointed out, reminding his wife of the conversation earlier in the day. \"Do you recall how she said that as soon as she spent time with other people again, she wasn\u0027t nearly as forgetful?\"\\n\\n Rosalie thought about this for a moment. \"She did, didn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n Harry was cautious about saying too much too soon. Rosalie\u0027s eyes had been opened when she\u0027d seen the facility, and it didn\u0027t hurt that a number of their friends had already made the move.\\n\\n \"Lucy also said the unit closest to hers is available.\" He said this casually and waited for a response. While his wife had been chatting with her friends, Harry had met with the administrator to see if they could secure that particular unit. Naturally, he wouldn\u0027t make a decision like this without discussing it with Rosalie first, but he was beginning to feel confident that she saw the wisdom of such a move.\\n\\n Rosalie looked at him the same way she had all those years ago, when they\u0027d considered purchasing this very house. She loved this place and Harry loved her. He would\u0027ve moved heaven and earth to buy the house she wanted.\\n\\n \"Do you honestly think we should give up our home, Harry?\"\\n\\n He hated that it had come to this. \"Like I said, this old place is getting to be too much for me.\"\\n\\n Slowly Rosalie lowered her gaze and conceded. \"And me.\"\\n\\n This was the first time she\u0027d been willing to admit that age had taken a toll on her, too. As far as Harry was concerned, it was a giant leap forward.\\n\\n \"We should ask the girls,\" she said tentatively.\\n\\n \"Good idea.\" Their youngest daughter was coming to spend Christmas with them, and Lorraine and family would arrive the day after. Both his daughters agreed with Harry. Like him, they recognized the necessity of this change, even if they hadn\u0027t quite grasped its urgency.\\n\\n Harry knew that if Rosalie discussed the situation with either Lorraine or Donna, their daughters would reassure her in ways he couldn\u0027t. He felt it was only a matter of time. God willing, everything would fall into place....\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to discuss it again until after Christmas, though,\" Rosalie insisted. \"I won\u0027t even talk about moving until the holidays are over.\"\\n\\n \"But, Rosalie, there\u0027s only the one unit,\" he blurted out. \"Unless we give the administrator a security check, someone else might take it.\"\\n\\n \"Then so be it,\" she said, missing the point that he\u0027d talked to the administrator without her knowledge.\\n\\n \"Mrs. Goldsmith told me there\u0027s another party interested.\" A sense of dread almost overwhelmed him. If they didn\u0027t act quickly, the unit would go to some other couple.\\n\\n \"Of course she told you that,\" Rosalie said with unshakable confidence. \"That\u0027s what she\u0027s supposed to say. It\u0027s a tactic, Harry. You, of all people, should know the things people will say when they\u0027re after a sale.\"\\n\\n Frustration beat hard against his chest. \"But, Rosalie....\"\\n\\n \"Harry, sweetheart, don\u0027t be so concerned. If we lose this unit, another will come up later.\"\\n\\n Without telling her what Dr. Snellgrove had said, Harry had no choice but to agree. \"Personally, I\u0027d like this all settled before the holidays.\"\\n\\n \"Do you mind if we wait?\" Rosalie asked. \"It won\u0027t make any difference, will it?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose you\u0027re right,\" he said reluctantly. \"It doesn\u0027t really matter.\" Only it did, but Harry couldn\u0027t find it in his heart to tell her why.\\n\\n Harry left the table and as much as he hated his walker, he reached for it. The damn thing was a nuisance, but at this stage it was a necessary one.\\n\\n \"The girls could help us move while they\u0027re here.\" He made the suggestion as he settled back into his recliner.\\n\\n \"Not over Christmas, Harry. Please, sweetheart, I don\u0027t want to ask that of them.\"\\n\\n He nodded. He wouldn\u0027t mention it again. Not tonight.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t look good,\" Shirley had the audacity to say.\\n\\n \"Rosalie wants to wait until after Christmas.\"\\n\\n Mercy didn\u0027t know what to do. \"That won\u0027t work.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" Both her friends turned to face her.\\n\\n Mercy sighed, more burdened now than ever. \"Because Harry will be in Heaven by then.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/where-angels-go-angels-everywhere-6/page-9.html","bookId":2630,"book":{"id":2630,"title":"Where Angels Go (Angels Everywhere #6)","description":"Storyline: Where Angels Go (Angels Everywhere #6) \\n Christmas is a time for angel. \\n Shirley, Goodness and Mercy are back!
