{"id":102038,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Beth wasn\u0027t imagining it. The relationship between her and Peter had shifted since the night of her mother\u0027s call. That\u0027d been two days ago, and whenever they logged on to the game she lowered her guard a fraction more. So did Peter.\n The biggest difference was that they chatted far more than strictly necessary. And their messaging didn\u0027t concern the game as much as it did each other.\n You\u0027re right on time, I notice, he wrote when she logged on.\n Beth kicked off her shoes as she settled into the chair by her desk. She set aside the soda she was drinking in order to respond. You\u0027re ahead of schedule.\n I was anxious.\n Beth read his words and leaned away from her desk. She wasn\u0027t sure how to decipher that comment. Did Peter mean he was anticipating her arrival? Or was he implying that he was worried she\u0027d be late? It was hard to tell.\n Anxious why? she asked, preferring the direct approach.\n To talk to you.\n Now that they\u0027d reached level forty in World of Warcraft, the option to purchase a mount had been offered to them. It was a big advantage and one they\u0027d been considering. Any particular reason? she asked, wondering if that was what he wanted to discuss.\n Yeah.\n That didn\u0027t tell her anything. Would you care to explain?\n His reply didn\u0027t come for a couple of minutes, as if he needed to think about it first. So this obviously wasn\u0027t about the possibility of adding a mount to their list of resources.\n We\u0027ve been partners - how long? he asked instead.\n Six months.\n It seems longer.\n Again Beth didn\u0027t know what to make of that. Really?\n I trust you.\n She laughed. As well you should. I\u0027ve covered your butt often enough, oh mighty Timixie.\n I\u0027ve covered yours, too.\n For which I\u0027m most grateful.\n That\u0027s only appropriate.\n Beth laughed, enjoying the light, teasing quality of their exchange. She typed quickly. Are you going to chatter all night or are we going to play?\n Can\u0027t we do both?\n Beth felt a rush of warmth. It was a pleasant sensation and one she\u0027d almost forgotten. Talking with the opposite sex was awkward for her, except in situations that didn\u0027t involve potentially romantic expectations - with family, for instance, or male colleagues or friends like Sam. She felt comfortable with Peter, at ease. Although they hadn\u0027t even spoken on the phone, let alone face-to-face, it was the first time she\u0027d had that kind of reaction to a man since John.\n Despite what her mother said, Beth had dated after her divorce; she just hadn\u0027t done it successfully. Most social conversations with men felt stilted. She struggled with how much to say or not to say.\n Her record was three dates with the same man. Luke Whitcomb. He\u0027d been a nice guy, entertaining and funny. His sense of humor had carried her for the three dates.\n She probably would\u0027ve accepted a fourth except that he\u0027d admitted their relationship wasn\u0027t working for him. He\u0027d been sincere when he said they should call it quits before either of them got hurt.\n Well, surprise, surprise. Luke\u0027s rejection had cut deep and served, once again, to convince Beth that she was incapable of ever attracting another man. Afterward she\u0027d steered away from dating at all and a couple of weeks later, she\u0027d found the World of Warcraft and since then, almost her entire social life had been as a Night Elf and hunter.\n Now there was Peter, a man she\u0027d never actually met. His family had suggested he \"get a life,\" so it was highly probably that he was single, too. Beth wanted to ask him, only she couldn\u0027t figure out how to do it without being obvious. A straightforward question about his marital status seemed out of line at this stage.\n They\u0027d been into the game for about ten minutes when Peter sent her another message. This might be a stupid question but are you...single, married, whatever?\n He\u0027d asked her.\n Beth\u0027s relief was instantaneous. Single.\n Me, too. Age?\n Is this an interrogation? she typed back.\n Sort of. Do you mind?\n Not really. She didn\u0027t, because in the process she was learning more about him.\n I\u0027ll tell if you will.\n All right.\n I\u0027m edging toward thirty, he typed. Which is one reason my family is after me to meet someone.\n Me, too. Her heart really started to pound then. Perhaps that candle her mother had lit in church was working. Perhaps, in some quirky way, her prayer had taken effect.\n Peter was single; she was single.\n He lived in Seattle and she lived in Seattle.\n He was close to her age and a professional, just as she was.\n This almost sounded too good to be true.\n My family says it\u0027s time I met someone, she typed next.\n They do? He seemed as astonished as she felt - as if he, too, was finding this a bit too coincidental. Eerie, even.\n A moment later, he typed, What\u0027s wrong with you?\n Well, he was direct enough, but she\u0027d been pretty honest with him, too. She toyed with the idea of telling him she\u0027d been married and divorced, and then remembered Heidi\u0027s advice. It wasn\u0027t necessary to blurt out everything on the first date - even if this wasn\u0027t exactly a date.\n I spend too much time playing computer games. She smiled as her fingers skipped effortlessly over the keyboard.\n I\u0027ve got the same problem, came his reply.\n Silly though it was, Beth felt sure they were both smiling. Their conversation went on for another hour, and she was shocked to realize the game had become secondary.\n That night when Beth crawled into bed and drew the blanket over her shoulders, she fell into an easy, peaceful sleep. She woke with a feeling of expectation, as if something wonderful was about to happen. Keeping her eyes closed, she tried to hang on to that sensation for as long as she could, afraid reality would chase it away.\n The phone rang while she dressed for work. Call display told her it was her mother.\n \"Hi, Mom,\" she said, answering the phone while fastening an earring.\n \"You sound happy.\"\n \"I am - well, kind of.\"\n Her mother\u0027s hesitation was brief. \"Does this have anything to do with the man you met on that computer game you\u0027re always playing?\"\n Beth found it hard to believe she\u0027d actually mentioned Peter to her mother. She\u0027d done it on impulse - a bad impulse - hoping to shut down a barrage of veiled criticism and heavy-handed encouragement. Normally her mother would be the last person she\u0027d tell. \"We haven\u0027t even met, Mom,\" she finally confessed. \"At least not in the flesh.\"\n \"What\u0027s the holdup?\"\n \"He hasn\u0027t suggested we meet outside the game,\" Beth said, which in her opinion was a perfectly logical explanation. In her mother\u0027s generation, the men always did the asking. She figured this was an excuse even her marriage-obsessed mother would accept.\n \"Then you suggest it.\"\n So much for that. \"Mother!\"\n \"I\u0027m serious,\" Joyce said. \"Why beat around the bush? You\u0027re a woman who knows what she wants. Now go and get it.\"\n Beth thought about asking Peter. Why not? One of them had to break the ice. \"I\u0027d like to meet him but I don\u0027t want to appear forward.\"\n \"Marybeth, you don\u0027t have much time. Maybe he\u0027s shy. Maybe he\u0027s waiting for you to bring it up. Show a bit of initiative, will you? It\u0027s later than you think.\"\n \"Trust me, Mother, Peter isn\u0027t shy.\" She knew this from the way he attacked their enemies on WoW.\n \"Then why wait?\"\n Beth nibbled on her lower lip. \"I don\u0027t want to rush into anything.\"\n \"But it\u0027s already December twentieth. Christmas is right around the corner.\"\n This wasn\u0027t making sense. \"Why is it so important that Peter join us for Christmas?\" Beth asked, beginning to have some suspicions.\n \"It isn\u0027t important...Well, in a manner of speaking it is. Your father and I have this wager.\"\n \"Mother!\" Her parents constantly made small bets with each other. Most of the time Beth found this habit of theirs amusing. Not now, though. Not when their wager was about her. \"You\u0027d better tell me everything.\"\n \"Okay...\" Her mother inhaled deeply. \"Last Christmas, your father said that at the rate you were going you\u0027d never remarry.\"\n \"And you disagreed with him.\"\n \"Of course I did! Marybeth, you have no idea what an attractive young woman you are. You should be happy.\"\n \"I am happy,\" she insisted.\n \"I disagree. You just think you are.\"\n Beth rolled her eyes, knowing it wouldn\u0027t do any good to argue.\n \"You should be dating,\" her mother continued.\n \"And getting married and becoming a mother.\" The litany was a familiar one.\n \"Yes,\" Joyce Fischer said. \"I hate the idea that you\u0027ve got nothing more pressing to go home to than that darned computer game.\"\n \"You don\u0027t understand, Mom. Peter and I are at level forty and - \" She stopped. There was no point in explaining further.\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\n \"Never mind.\"\n \"Does this have anything to do with bringing Peter to dinner on Christmas Day?\" her mother wanted to know.\n \"Nothing whatsoever.\"\n \"But that\u0027s the important thing here. Otherwise your father...\"\n \"Yes?\" Beth murmured.\n \"Otherwise I\u0027ll be hauling the garbage out to the curb every Wednesday for the next six months.\"\n \"A fate worse than death,\" Beth muttered sarcastically.\n \"It isn\u0027t that I mind dealing with the garbage,\" her mother went on, \"but I do mind losing another bet to your father, especially when you\u0027re so close to actually having a date for Christmas.\"\n Beth didn\u0027t consider herself close at all. In her desperation to win this bet, Joyce was being completely unreasonable.\n \"Promise me you\u0027ll ask Peter,\" her mother pleaded.\n This had gone on long enough. \"I\u0027ll do no such thing.\"\n \"If not for my sake, then your own, Marybeth.\"\n \"No!\" That was final, too.\n The silence that followed weakened her resolve. \"Don\u0027t you realize how ridiculous you\u0027re being?\" Beth said. \"Peter\u0027s practically a stranger.\"\n \"Just meet him,\" Joyce wheedled. \"That\u0027s all I ask. Whether he comes to Christmas dinner or not is entirely up to you. All I ask is that the two of you connect. Promise me that much.\"\n While she\u0027d never openly admit it, Beth was curious about her online partner. She couldn\u0027t help it. She wondered if he was being pressured by his family about meeting her, too. It was worth asking.\n She ended the conversation with her mother by booking a lunch date for later in the week.\n That evening, as soon as Beth got home from work, she logged on to the game. Peter came on ten minutes after that. The first thing he did was ask about the amount of gold they\u0027d accumulated toward their purchase of a mount. The fact that he avoided the kind of personal comment they\u0027d exchanged the night before was telling. She suspected he was uncomfortable with the way their conversation had turned toward the personal. It had unsettled her, too, and at the same time excited her.\n Beth took his cue and simply answered his question.\n They played for an hour, but neither one seemed focused on the game.\n I need to leave early, she typed in.\n Do you have a hot date?\n It wasn\u0027t a date at all. Beth was meeting Heidi to go over the details of their weekend in Leavenworth. An appointment, she told him.\n Business or pleasure?\n He was getting mighty inquisitive. Pleasure, she answered.\n There was a slight pause. Have fun.\n You, too.\n No problem meeting tomorrow night?\n He\u0027d never asked before. None.\n Good. Talk to you then.\n Beth put Borincana safely away and exited the game. The happy feeling that had greeted her that morning had completely evaporated. She didn\u0027t understand what had happened with Peter or why. Was he backing off, losing interest? He\u0027d been eager to confirm that she\u0027d be playing tomorrow, though, so he might just prefer his romance virtual. He might be afraid of taking their relationship into the realms of reality.\n What a sorry lot they were, both of them more comfortable in the guise of a fantasy character than dealing with real life. They were two sad, lonely people reaching out at Christmas, wanting to connect and too afraid to try. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/where-angels-go-angels-everywhere-6/page-7.html","bookId":2630,"book":{"id":2630,"title":"Where Angels Go (Angels Everywhere #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Where Angels Go (Angels Everywhere #6) \n Christmas is a time for angel. \n Shirley, Goodness and Mercy are back!
