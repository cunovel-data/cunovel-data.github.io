{"id":102036,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Carter Jackson pressed his ear as hard as he could against his bedroom door. If he shut his eyes and concentrated he could hear his parents\u0027 conversation.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, honey. I know how much Carter wants a dog, but we can\u0027t afford one right now.\"\n \"But, David, we promised.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t promise him any such thing, Laurie. I said maybe he could have a dog for Christmas.\"\n Carter\u0027s mother sounded sad. \"It\u0027ll break his heart.\"\n \"Believe me, I know that. I don\u0027t like this any better than you do.\"\n Although he was only nine, Carter understood that his father wanted him to have a dog, just as he had when he was Carter\u0027s age. Carter had already decided to give his dog the same name as his father\u0027s - Rusty. Rusty was a good name for a dog.\n \"We could get a dog from the shelter,\" his mom was saying. \"A rescue.\"\n \"It\u0027s not the cost of the dog. It\u0027s the vet bills, the food, everything else.\"\n His mother didn\u0027t respond.\n \"You looked at the budget, didn\u0027t you? If there was any way we could make it happen, we would. But you know as well as I do that we can\u0027t afford a dog. We can barely afford a Christmas tree!\"\n Carter wasn\u0027t sure what a budget was, but he knew it must have something to do with money. Money always seemed to be a problem. His mother used to work at a dress shop in downtown Leavenworth, but the shop closed and she hadn\u0027t been able to find another job.\n That was all right with Carter. He liked having her at home, and so did his little sister, Bailey. After school they both liked being able to go home rather than to the day care lady down the street. Their mother usually had a snack or a small surprise waiting for them. She seemed happier, too, not to be working such long hours, but Carter knew there were problems with the budget...whatever that was.\n \"Our health insurance rates just went up,\" his father said.\n \"I saw that,\" his mother murmured. Her voice was quiet, making it difficult for Carter to hear everything she said. \"I try to keep the heat as low as I can while the kids are in school, not that it\u0027s helped all that much.\"\n That explained why his mother was always wearing a sweater when Carter got home from school.\n \"The oil prices are killing us,\" his father said. He sounded angry.\n \"I know. I\u0027m sorry.\" This came from his mother.\n \"It\u0027s not your fault, Laurie.\"\n Carter risked opening the door a crack, to see what he could. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the light, but then he saw his parents. They sat on the sofa and his mother\u0027s head rested on his father\u0027s shoulder. His father had one arm around his mother, and they seemed to be leaning against each other.\n \"Should we tell Carter now or wait until Christmas morning?\" she asked.\n Carter bit his lip. They\u0027d promised him a dog. His father said he hadn\u0027t, but he had. He just didn\u0027t remember. He\u0027d said it this summer, and ever since then Carter had hung on to that promise - he could have a dog at Christmas.\n It wasn\u0027t fair and he struggled not to break into tears. Turning his head, he buried his face in his arms and breathed deeply. He couldn\u0027t let them see him standing there - or hear him cry.\n \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll be able to buy the kids any gifts this year,\" his father continued.\n \"It\u0027s all right, honey,\" his mother reassured him. \"There\u0027ll be plenty of presents from your parents and mine. The gifts from your family are already here. The kids will have something to open. Besides, we don\u0027t want to spoil Carter and Bailey. It\u0027s more important that they know the true meaning of Christmas.\"\n His father seemed to agree.\n Carter couldn\u0027t listen to any more of their conversation. His sister was sound asleep in the bed across from his own. Bailey was in first grade and he was in fourth. Bailey wanted her own room. But if he couldn\u0027t have a dog, then Bailey wasn\u0027t going to get a bedroom all to herself, either. That was what Bailey had asked Santa for in her letter.\n The kids at school told Bailey she was stupid to believe in Santa. Carter didn\u0027t believe anymore, but he didn\u0027t want to say anything, especially to his little sister. She still believed. When he was her age, he\u0027d wanted to believe, too.\n Santa was like his grandparents who lived in Wenatchee. His mother\u0027s family didn\u0027t have a budget, or at least he didn\u0027t think so. It never seemed hard for them to buy presents the way it was for his parents. Maybe...\n Carter decided he\u0027d mention the possibility to his mother in the morning and see what she said. If his own mom and dad couldn\u0027t afford a dog, then maybe they\u0027d let his grandparents buy him one. Or perhaps Grandma and Grandpa could pay the vet bills his dad was so worried about.\n Feeling better now, Carter pulled back his sheets and slipped into bed. He\u0027d just closed his eyes when a backup plan came to mind. Santa might be make-believe but God was real, and Christmas was Jesus\u0027s birthday. Remembering that, he got out of bed and knelt down. He\u0027d already said his bedtime prayers, but this was extra. He hoped God wouldn\u0027t mind hearing from him again.\n \"Dear God,\" he whispered. \"Thank You for Your birthday. I think it\u0027s great that because You were born we get presents. I\u0027m really glad You arranged it like that. Um, God, I asked about getting a dog before and my parents said I had to wait. I waited. It was hard, too.\n \"They said I had to be nine years old before I was responsible enough to take care of a dog. Well, I\u0027m nine and I do all my chores and I do my homework and I don\u0027t cheat on tests or anything.\"\n He hesitated, thinking he\u0027d better tell the whole truth. God knew anyway. \"Sometimes Mom has to remind me about my chores. But I try to be good.\"\n Carter paused, wondering if God might say something back. He listened intently, his eyes closed, but no matter how hard he concentrated he couldn\u0027t hear anything. That didn\u0027t mean God wasn\u0027t listening, though; Carter understood that.\n \"If You could find a way to get me a dog for Christmas, God, I\u0027d really like it. I promise to take care of Rusty and train him right. I\u0027ll make sure he\u0027s loved. Thank you.\"\n Finished now, Carter lowered his head and whispered, \"Amen.\" He stayed on his knees a few minutes longer, in case God wanted to talk to him, after all. Eventually he climbed back into bed.\n God had a dog for him, a special one. Carter was sure of it. He didn\u0027t know how the dog would arrive. Maybe his grandparents would give him one for Christmas, maybe not. He\u0027d just wait and see. He might not believe in Santa anymore, but Carter believed God answered prayers. All he had to do now was be patient.\n \"You heard?\" Gabriel asked Shirley. The Prayer Ambassador had once worked as a guardian angel and her love for children was the reason he usually assigned Shirley the prayer requests from boys and girls.\n \"A dog,\" Shirley repeated.\n \"There are more important requests, if you prefer,\" Gabriel said.\n \"No,\" came her immediate reply. \"I want to help Carter get his dog.\"\n \"I thought you would.\"\n \"It\u0027s just that...\"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"It\u0027s just that I could probably take on two or three such requests while I\u0027m on Earth,\" the angel said with utter confidence. \"But I know why you haven\u0027t given me more than one.\"\n \"You do?\" Gabriel asked. \"And why would that be?\"\n \"My real assignment is to keep watch over Goodness and Mercy. Heaven knows, and I don\u0027t mean that as a pun - \" she paused and gave him a smug smile \" - those two need looking after.\"\n \"Indeed they do,\" Gabriel agreed. \"But it seems to me that you\u0027ve taken part in their schemes a number of times.\"\n \"Under protest,\" Shirley rushed to explain. \"I knew they were headed for trouble and I tried to warn them, but they wouldn\u0027t listen to me. So what choice did I have?\" She shook her head ruefully. \"You can\u0027t imagine the trouble I\u0027ve saved you on other assignments. But I\u0027m only one angel and there\u0027s only so much I can do on my own.\"\n Gabriel didn\u0027t need a reminder of the problems these three had caused. Yes, he did expect Shirley to be a supervisor of sorts for the other two, but as often as not they\u0027d led her into temptation. Still...\n \"As the most responsible of the trio - \"\n \"That would be me,\" Shirley said, cutting him off. She folded her wings close to her back without revealing any degree of eagerness as Goodness and Mercy had done. Shirley was the picture of calm serenity, of unquestionable confidence.\n \"Let me point out the time limitations involved,\" Gabriel said. \"All three of you need to return to Heaven on Christmas Eve.\" This shouldn\u0027t come as any surprise, since it was one of the terms always set upon them during visits to Earth at this time of year.\n A look of panic flashed into Shirley\u0027s eyes. \"That means we have barely a week by the earthly calendar.\"\n \"Don\u0027t forget, we need you back for the festivities,\" Gabriel told her.\n \"Yes, of course.\" She did seem unusually concerned with the temporal constraints, which he found odd, considering that they\u0027d answered prayer requests in less time than that.\n \"If there are problems, I can come directly to you?\" Shirley asked.\n It went without saying that with Goodness and Mercy, there were bound to be problems. \"Of course.\"\n On second thought, Gabriel wasn\u0027t so sure of that. He\u0027d seen compassion and a new depth in Mercy; she understood the seriousness of her assignment. Harry Alderwood\u0027s days on Earth were few, and Mercy would have to convince Rosalie to move and at the same time prepare Harry for the crossing. Heaven awaited his arrival.\n As far as Goodness went...That was an entirely different story. Beth Fischer had lessons to learn, obstacles to negotiate - obstacles of her own making. It might not be as easy as Goodness assumed to steer her toward the future. Gabriel would keep a close eye on this assignment.\n And young Carter Jackson - this wasn\u0027t an easy prayer request, either, despite what Shirley seemed to think. She might be a relatively senior angel, but she had a few lessons to learn herself.\n \"Can I see Carter?\" Shirley asked.\n \"Of course.\" As he\u0027d done with the others, Gabriel parted the veil between the two realms and offered Shirley a chance to assess the situation.\n Sitting at the breakfast table, Carter watched his parents closely.\n \"You remember this summer you said I could have a dog when I\u0027m nine, Dad?\" he asked, braving the subject dearest to his heart.\n His dad exchanged a look with his mother. \"I remember.\"\n \"I\u0027m nine now.\"\n His father put down his fork, and the careful way he laid it on the table told Carter this was going to be an important discussion. \"Son, it hurts me to tell you this, but we can\u0027t afford a dog.\"\n \"Dad...\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I know you\u0027ve been hoping to get a dog, but we can\u0027t manage it financially, Carter.\"\n Despite his efforts, Carter\u0027s eyes filled with tears and everything in the room went blurry. His mother came to stand behind him. Embarrassed to be caught crying, Carter wiped his face with his sleeve and gulped several times.\n \"As soon as we can afford one, we\u0027ll get you a dog,\" she whispered, placing her hands on his shoulders. \"We promise.\"\n \"But you promised before,\" Carter challenged. \"You said I could have a dog when I turned nine. And then you said I had to wait until Christmas. And now...\"\n His father looked as sad as Carter had ever seen him. \"I\u0027m sorry, Carter. I\u0027m doing the best I can, and so is your mother.\"\n Bailey had started to cry, too. Carter tried to stop, but all he could do was sniffle back the tears. He felt like running away from the table. He couldn\u0027t eat.\n \"What about Grandma and Grandpa Parker?\" he asked, clinging to the dream that his grandparents would give him the dog he so badly wanted.\n \"I\u0027ve spoken to them,\" his father said.\n Carter felt hope spring to life as he held his breath, waiting to hear the verdict.\n \"If your grandparents buy you a dog, that\u0027s just the beginning of what it\u0027ll cost. There\u0027s a whole lot more that goes along with owning a dog.\"\n \"He could eat my food,\" Carter insisted. He\u0027d already considered this. \"I don\u0027t mind sharing.\"\n \"Then there are shots.\"\n \"I\u0027ll take them,\" Carter said. It didn\u0027t matter how much they hurt, either.\n \"The shots are for the dog, Carter, and they\u0027re expensive.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"There\u0027s the license and obedience school and neutering and a dozen other costs. All of that would drain the family budget. It won\u0027t be long, though. Okay?\"\n Carter wasn\u0027t sure he should believe his father. \"How long?\"\n \"David.\" His mother\u0027s voice was soft and filled with warning, almost as if she feared his father would make another promise he couldn\u0027t keep.\n \"I don\u0027t know, but I promise that as soon as we can afford it, you\u0027ll get your dog.\"\n That was the same thing his mother had said. Carter swallowed hard. He couldn\u0027t ask his father\u0027s parents. They lived back east and they mailed their gifts, which had arrived last week. The gaily wrapped presents were arranged on the coffee table with a miniature Christmas tree his mother had bought at the grocery store for five dollars. His one hope had been Grandma and Grandpa Parker - his mom\u0027s parents - and according to his father, it wasn\u0027t going to happen.\n His last chance, his only chance now, was God. And with everything inside him, Carter believed God would send him a dog. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/where-angels-go-angels-everywhere-6/page-5.html","bookId":2630,"book":{"id":2630,"title":"Where Angels Go (Angels Everywhere #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Where Angels Go (Angels Everywhere #6) \n Christmas is a time for angel. \n Shirley, Goodness and Mercy are back!
