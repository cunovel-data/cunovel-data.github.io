{"id":102044,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Leavenworth was everything Beth had imagined it would be. When the train pulled in, the sun was shining, and the freshly fallen snow glistened brightly. The entire town was a Christmas wonderland, unlike anything she\u0027d ever seen. Main Street was closed to cars, and in the center of the wide street, burn barrels had been set up, where people could gather to warm their hands. Children were sledding down the short slope next to the gazebo, while a group of costumed carolers entertained the crowd. It was at this gazebo that Beth Fischer would be meeting Peter in a few hours. Once they were off the train, Heidi, Sam, two-year-old Adam and Beth toured the area. Adam wanted to go sledding, so Sam quickly purchased a round plastic sled. Soon father and son were gliding down the incline while Heidi took photographs. \"I\u0027ll put one of these in our Christmas letter,\" she told Beth excitedly. \"Isn\u0027t it a little late to be mailing out cards?\" Beth teased. Heidi was always late. In fact, last year\u0027s Christmas cards had arrived in mid-January. Heidi had said that Beth should either consider them very late or exceptionally early. Beth had been too nervous to eat all day and seeing a vendor selling roasted chestnuts, she purchased a small bag to share with her friend. Heidi bit into one. \"Hey, these aren\u0027t bad. They\u0027re kind of sweet.\" Beth tried one, too, and then another. Now she could say she\u0027d tasted chestnuts roasting on an open fire, just like the Christmas song said. As they strolled down the street taking in the sights and smells and sounds of Christmas, Beth found herself studying faces. She wondered if Peter\u0027s bus had come in yet. Could that tall, handsome man be him? When a little girl leaped into his arms, Beth decided it probably wasn\u0027t. \"Are you sorry you agreed to meet Peter so late in the day?\" \"Yes,\" she said tersely. Soon after that, Sam caught up with them. Adam, bundled from head to foot, was asleep in his father\u0027s arms, exhausted from their outing in the snow. \"We were just talking about Beth\u0027s appointment,\" Heidi told her husband. \"I hope you and your WoW partner have a way to connect if something goes wrong,\" the ever-practical Sam said. \"There must be a thousand people here this afternoon.\" \"Peter e-mailed me his cell phone number.\" \"Did you give him yours?\" Heidi asked. \"No, I didn\u0027t think of it.\" That wasn\u0027t completely accurate. \"Actually, I meant to, but we started talking and I forgot.\" \"That\u0027s not a good sign,\" Sam began. \"What if - \" \"Sam,\" Heidi interrupted. \"Everything\u0027s going to work out fine.\" Beth hoped her friend was right. \"You\u0027ll come with me, won\u0027t you?\" she asked Heidi. The time was growing closer. At three o\u0027clock, it started to snow. Clouds obscured the sky as dusk fell over the town; by four-thirty it would be completely dark. \"Come with you?\" Heidi repeated. \"You\u0027re kidding, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Heidi, please. I\u0027m so nervous I\u0027m about to throw up.\" \"This should be interesting. All you\u0027ve had to eat is a couple of roasted chestnuts.\" \"Don\u0027t joke,\" Beth muttered. \"I\u0027m serious.\" \"Okay,\" Heidi said. \"I\u0027ll come if you really want me to, but I\u0027m only going to stay long enough for the two of you to meet.\" \"What if we don\u0027t like each other?\" Beth asked, feeling a sense of dread. She was bringing so many hopes, so much yearning, to this encounter that she was afraid she\u0027d set herself up for failure. The night before, as they exchanged instant messages, Peter was the one who\u0027d seemed anxious. They\u0027d tried to reassure each other. That was when he\u0027d given her his phone number. Online they had so much to talk about, and Beth sincerely hoped the chemistry that seemed to spark between them on the screen translated into real life. At ten minutes to four, Beth and Heidi made their way toward the gazebo, where Peter would be waiting for her. She\u0027d know him by the long-stemmed red rose and his Seahawks hat. \"This is the most romantic date I\u0027ve ever heard about,\" Heidi said dreamily. Beth slipped her arm through Heidi\u0027s. \"I\u0027m so grateful you\u0027re here.\" They stood in the background because Beth was feeling shy and a bit shaky, which could\u0027ve been low blood sugar, Heidi told her. In any event, her plan was to wait for him and then casually walk up and introduce herself. \"There he is!\" Heidi said, pointing toward a cluster of people near the gazebo. \"Where? Where? I don\u0027t see him.\" And then she did. \"Beth, oh my goodness, look at him! He\u0027s gorgeous.\" Beth froze and her heart sank to her knees. Her stomach pitched wildly. \"He\u0027s that, all right,\" she whispered numbly. \"How did you get so lucky?\" Heidi was too excited to notice Beth\u0027s complete lack of enthusiasm. \"I don\u0027t know,\" Beth said, her voice low and emotionless. Heidi turned to stare at her. \"What\u0027s the matter with you? Peter looks like he stepped off the pages of a romance novel.\" \"He does, doesn\u0027t he?\" Beth murmured. Then she covered her face with both hands and turned away. Whipping the red hat off her head, she quickly unwrapped the telltale scarf from around her neck, as well. \"Beth, what\u0027s wrong?\" Heidi asked. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Beth repeated. \"You want me to tell you what\u0027s wrong? That Peter is an imposter!\" \"How can he be an imposter when you\u0027ve never met him before?\" \"His name isn\u0027t Peter,\" she choked out. \"It\u0027s John Nicodemus and he\u0027s my ex-husband.\" That news seemed to shock her friend. \"What?\" \"Let\u0027s get out of here before he sees me,\" Beth urged. Heidi couldn\u0027t possibly have known what John looked like, because she and Heidi hadn\u0027t met until five years ago - and she certainly didn\u0027t keep wedding photos at her desk or in her condo. Together they hurried around the corner and Beth flattened herself against the side of a building. \"What are you going to do?\" Heidi asked curiously. Beth needed to think. At first she\u0027d been numb with shock, but now she was angry. \"He planned this. He knew all along.\" \"Beth, that\u0027s not fair. How could he have?\" \"We never exchanged last names. And he changed his first name, didn\u0027t he? He tricked me.\" Heidi shook her head. \"Didn\u0027t you tell me you shortened your name to Beth after your divorce?\" \"I did,\" she admitted. \"I wanted to make a fresh start, so I decided that from then on, I\u0027d just use Beth.\" \"Perhaps John did the same thing,\" Heidi suggested. Beth wasn\u0027t willing to concede the point. \"His middle name is Peter,\" she said grudgingly. \"It never occured to me...\" \"He is gorgeous, though.\" \"His good looks are the only thing he has going for him,\" Beth mumbled. \"That isn\u0027t what you told me earlier.\" \"What do you mean?\" Heidi wasn\u0027t usually this argumentative. Clearly, she was taking Peter/John\u0027s side, and that infuriated Beth. \"Don\u0027t you remember what you said last week?\" Heidi asked. \"You told me Peter is everything your first husband wasn\u0027t.\" \"I said that?\" What an idiot she\u0027d been. What an imbecile. She\u0027d allowed John to make a fool of her. He knew who she was. He had to have known. How could he not? But maybe...just maybe, he didn\u0027t. Could they have found each other online? No one would believe something this random could actually happen. It was more than bizarre. It was completely and totally implausible...wasn\u0027t it? \"You can\u0027t leave him standing there waiting for you like that,\" Heidi insisted. \"That would be cruel.\" Beth didn\u0027t respond, still trying to figure out how this had happened. It dawned on her that he couldn\u0027t have known, since he\u0027d been the one to suggest she meet him outside the gazebo. If he\u0027d known, he would never have given her the opportunity to see him first and then walk away. Unlikely though it seemed, she had to conclude that he was as much in the dark as she was. \"Did you hear me?\" Heidi demanded. \"You have to call him on his cell.\" \"No, you have to,\" Beth said frantically. \"I beg your pardon?\" Heidi looked confused. \"Use my phone.\" She thrust it at her friend. \"Why me? Beth, you\u0027re the one who should talk to him, not me.\" She refused to accept the phone. \"I can\u0027t...He\u0027ll recognize my voice.\" He would, too. It might\u0027ve been almost ten years since the divorce, but that wouldn\u0027t matter. John would know her voice the same way she would his. \"You don\u0027t want him to find out it\u0027s you?\" Heidi asked, sounding even more confused. \"No. Not yet. I need to think.\" This awkward situation had to be handled delicately or John might assume she\u0027d tricked him - which was what she\u0027d suspected about him. \"Here - I\u0027ll do it,\" Heidi said and snatched the phone away from her. \"What should I tell him?\" Beth hadn\u0027t thought that far ahead. \"I - I\u0027m not sure.\" \"Should I say something came up at the last minute and you had to leave?\" \"But if he asks what it is...\" Beth was growing desperate. \"He won\u0027t,\" Heidi said. \"Anyway, something did come up, so it isn\u0027t like you\u0027re lying.\" Beth shrugged helplessly. \"Give me his cell phone number.\" Heidi held out her hand. Digging through her purse, Beth nearly dumped the entire contents in the snow. \"Relax,\" Heidi said in an annoyingly calm voice. \"Re-e-lax.\" Beth scowled at her, and as soon as she found the crumpled slip of paper with his phone number, she slapped it in Heidi\u0027s hand. Heidi punched out the number, holding the phone close to Beth\u0027s ear. Peter/John answered on the first ring. \"Hello.\" \"Is this Peter?\" \"Beth? Where are you?\" Heidi glanced at Beth, who gestured for her to continue speaking. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Peter, but I can\u0027t make it. Something, uh, came up - at the last minute and I can\u0027t keep our appointment. I\u0027m so disappointed.\" This last part was said with feeling. \"I am, too,\" Peter responded. \"I didn\u0027t know what to think when you didn\u0027t show up at four.\" \"I\u0027d like to meet you. I really would - just not now. Can we arrange another time?\" Beth glared at her friend. She made a frenzied cutting motion with one hand but Heidi ignored her, turning her back on Beth. Beth hurried around in order to face her. Once more, she made exaggerated cutting motions, using both hands to emphasize the point. \"Next Friday, after Christmas, would be perfect,\" Heidi went on to say. \"Since I was the one who let you down, please come to my place. Yes, yes, I\u0027m sure.\" Beth\u0027s mouth fell open. Her friend had really crossed the line with that one. Before she could stop her, Heidi rattled off Beth\u0027s address. A moment later, Heidi clicked the cell phone shut and returned it to Beth. \"Have you gone insane?\" Beth cried. \"You gave him my address!\" \"Well, yes, that\u0027s what you wanted me to do, isn\u0027t it?\" \"No...yes. Oh, I don\u0027t know.\" Beth\u0027s ears felt frozen and she covered them with her hands. She didn\u0027t dare put on her hat until they were far from the gazebo. \"That gives you six days to prepare him.\" \"You\u0027re worried about John?\" Some friend Heidi had turned out to be! \"Not John,\" Heidi explained patiently. \"I\u0027m concerned about Peter, the man you fell in love with over the last six months.\" Then it hit Beth, something she\u0027d completely forgotten. \"He\u0027s married.\" \"What do you mean, he\u0027s married?\" \"A friend told me she\u0027d heard John remarried and if that\u0027s the case, he\u0027s either divorced a second time or cheating on his wife.\" A sick feeling attacked her stomach. \"My guess is that your friend was talking about some other John.\" \"It can\u0027t be...\" Or could it? Beth no longer knew. All she did know was that she had six days to sort this out before she confronted Peter/John with the truth.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/where-angels-go-angels-everywhere-6/page-13.html","bookId":2630,"book":{"id":2630,"title":"Where Angels Go (Angels Everywhere #6)","description":"Storyline: Where Angels Go (Angels Everywhere #6) Christmas is a time for angel.
