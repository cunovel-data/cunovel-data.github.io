{"id":10872,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. SLIPPING AWAY.","content":"When Lucy went out into the road outside the gates of the college, before seven o\u0027clock the next morning, Wyatt Edgell was already there waiting for her. It is a short, narrow road, or lane, and it leads to nowhere, unless Selwyn College be considered anywhere. It has been the privilege of the students of Selwyn to use this road as a shortcut to their college, but it will not be their privilege much longer. The road is now the private property of the authorities of Newnham, and a new wing connecting the old and the new halls will be built across the road, and the jealous walls that shut out the grounds from masculine eyes will be thrown down,[Pg 193] and the old dusty lane will be covered with smooth, green turf, and it will be a thoroughfare no longer for the foot of man to pass over. Perhaps they will restore again the old fortifications. There was a Roman camp here once, and a battle ditch running all the way to Grantchester. Every inch of ground here is classic, and strewn with remains of those old Romans who brought us all the gentler arts. Perhaps they brought the Muses with them and planted them at Newnham? There was an old Roman dug up the other day, four feet beneath the surface, a noble skeleton, six feet six in length. The whole earth teems with ancient coins and pottery and Roman relics. They will have to build a museum in the new wing to preserve the \u0027finds\u0027 that are unearthed in digging its foundations. Lucy was quite indifferent to the Romans. She would rather, if she had had the choice, have met one of their old ghosts in the lane than one of the Dons of Newnham taking her morning walk. She looked fearfully up and down the road when[Pg 194] she got outside the gate, but there were only some Selwyn men going down to the bathing sheds; there was not a girl in sight. Wyatt Edgell was walking up and down the path flicking at the sweetbriar hedge as he passed, and his eyes were looking down on the ground. He was so lost in thought that he did not see Lucy till he heard her little cry, and she ran to meet him. \u0027Oh!\u0027 she cried, a little pale and breathless, \u0027how is the Master? Is he worse this morning?\u0027 She augured badly from Edgell\u0027s downcast look. \u0027Not worse,\u0027 he said; \u0027at least, I hope not worse, but I fear not better. When I inquired at the lodge when the gates were opened at six o\u0027clock, they told me the Master had had a very disturbed night, that he had not slept at all, but that he did not appear to be in any pain. Your cousin has been up with him all night, and Mrs. Rae.\u0027 \u0027I was sure she would not leave him,\u0027 said the girl, the tears filling her eyes. She was thinking of the anguish in that kind old face when the Master slipped through her feeble arms. \u0027I think[Pg 195] I ought to go over at once and relieve her; she must be worn out.\u0027 Lucy didn\u0027t stay to think. She walked back to St. Benedict\u0027s with the undergraduate who had brought her the news; she didn\u0027t even stay to fetch her gloves. She walked down by his side in the morning sunshine, just as she had hurried out of her room, with a ridiculous little tennis-cap on her head and her ungloved hands. Two Newnham girls who were returning from an early—a very early—walk looked shocked, as well they might be, and some rude Selwyn men whistled as they passed. They were only jealous that she was not taking a morning walk with them. Lucy found the watchers still up when they reached the lodge. Mrs. Rae would not be persuaded to lie down, and she was looking dreadfully tired and worn out. She looked ten years older, Lucy thought, this morning, and her poor face was as white as her hair. Mary looked pale, too. Perhaps it was the air of that close room that was still darkened; and there was a shade of anxiety[Pg 196] under her eyes, but she would not own to being tired. She could stay up a week, if necessary. The Master had fallen into a doze; but Lucy\u0027s light footstep or the whisper of their voices reached him, and he woke up when she came in. Lucy went over to him and laid her warm, moist hand on his, and the touch seemed to revive him. \u0027Is the milking over?\u0027 he asked, turning upon her his pale-blue eyes with that strange brightness in them that is peculiar to the very old. \u0027I have heard the cows lowing all night for the calves. You have taken the calves away?\u0027 \u0027It is Lucy, uncle,\u0027 she said, stroking his hand softly—\u0027little Lucy, not Lucy\u0027s mother——\u0027 She was going to say \u0027grandmother,\u0027 but she thought \u0027mother\u0027 would humour his fancy best. \u0027Yes, yes: I know you, my dear. I have been watching for you all the night. You must not go away again for so long; they don\u0027t understand me here as you do. Where\u0027s Dick?\u0027 \u0027He is gone, uncle,\u0027 she said softly. She did not like to say that he was dead. [Pg 197] \u0027Gone? Where is he gone? He was here just now. Is he in the field or in the barn? Send him to me when he comes in, my dear.\u0027 Lucy turned away pale and trembling. She could not bear it; he did not recognise her in the least. The Tutor came in while she was there, and went over to the bed; but the Master took him for Dick—the brother who had died fifty years ago. His eyes lighted up when the Tutor came in, and with a strange, eager interest he asked him questions about the crops and the farm. All the later associations of his life had quite faded from his memory, and he had gone back to the scenes and faces of his youth. The Tutor turned away from the bed with a sigh. He had waited for this half his life. He had looked forward so long as he could remember to being Master of St. Benedict\u0027s, and now, when it seemed within his grasp, he turned from it with a sigh. What was it, after all, this shadow he was[Pg 198] grasping? Wealth, honour, position, it would all slip through his hands by-and-by, as it had slipped through the hands of the old scholar on the bed: all, everything, that had taken a lifetime—a long lifetime—to gain, would slip away, and there would be nothing left but old memories. Everything would fail; and he would go back to the old humble time, and the dear faces—if happily he had dear faces to go back to. There would be nothing left—nothing that he could carry away with him—but those old tender memories. The Tutor turned away from the bed and went out of the room. On the landing outside he saw Lucy sitting in the window-seat weeping. The tears were in his own eyes, and he could not trust himself to speak. He went over, and took Lucy\u0027s hand, and drew her towards him. \u0027Oh,\u0027 she murmured through her tears, \u0027he does not know me the least bit. He thinks I am his brother Dick\u0027s wife.\u0027 \u0027And he takes me for Dick,\u0027 said the Tutor, with an involuntary smile, pressing the little warm hand[Pg 199] he held. \u0027We shall all come to it, my dear, some day—to the vanishing-point, where everything slips away from us but the memories of our youth. Well for us at that time if we have nothing but innocent memories of kindly deeds and loving faces—if we have no regrets, no sorrow, no remorse! Perhaps it is the happiest lot to have the slate wiped clean of all the storms and passions of later years, and to go back at the last, and to take away with us only the memory of the old innocent early days.\u0027 He was a good deal moved. He might have committed dreadful crimes since the days of his innocent youth, instead of being a grave, sober, reverend Tutor of a college. \u0027You don\u0027t think he will ever be better?\u0027 Lucy sobbed. \u0027I don\u0027t think, even if his life is prolonged, that his mind will ever be clear again. I fear it has gone, quite gone. Perhaps it is better so: he will pass away happier; he will have no regrets; he will leave nothing behind.\u0027 [Pg 200] Lucy sat sobbing in the window-seat. If she had been older she would not have wept so freely: the young have so many tears to spare. \u0027There is nothing to regret,\u0027 he said tenderly, bending over the hand he still held. \u0027The dear Master has lived his life—a good life, and, I think, a happy one—and he will exchange it for a better and a happier. We have only to concern ourselves about those who are left—Mrs. Rae and your cousin. They must stay with us, Lucy; they must make the lodge their home. You must let them understand, dear\u0027—here the Senior Tutor really pressed Lucy\u0027s hand, that he had held all the time he had been talking to her, and she had never once thought of drawing it away: he would have taken her in his arms, but the servants were coming up and down stairs—\u0027you must let them quite understand,\u0027 he went on, \u0027that their home is here with us. I am sure we shall do everything to make them happy.\u0027 Lucy hadn\u0027t the least idea what he meant. She would have stayed at the lodge and taken[Pg 201] her share of the nursing night and day, but the Tutor would not hear of it. \u0027You have got your work to do, my dear,\u0027 he said. He called her \u0027my dear\u0027 now quite naturally. \u0027You have all your work cut out before you to be ready for the examinations in June. You can\u0027t afford to risk breaking down for the sake of doing work that any woman can do. A trained nurse from Addenbroke\u0027s will do all, and more than all, you three dear anxious women together.\u0027 He sent in a nurse from Addenbroke\u0027s during the morning, and Cousin Mary and the Master\u0027s wife were turned out of the room. It was quite time the Master\u0027s wife was turned out of the room, or there would have been two to nurse instead of one. The nurse who had been sent from Addenbroke\u0027s Hospital to nurse the Master was the little fluffy nurse that had been brought by her brother to Wyatt Edgell\u0027s rooms after that miserable folly, and had kept his secret. If Lucy didn\u0027t like trusting a foolish young man[Pg 202] she knew nothing about to this flighty nurse, she was much more unwilling to trust this valuable life in her hands. She watched with mistrust, and a certain dull glow of impatience, this little bit of a creature turn the Master\u0027s wife out of the room, and reverse everything that had been done under Cousin Mary\u0027s directions. The nurse from Addenbroke\u0027s pulled up the blinds and threw open the windows, and let in the balmy air of the sweet May morning, that everybody had been so anxious to keep out; and she threw off the heavy quilts, and took away the pillows, and did everything according to the latest fashion in nursing. If people do not choose to get well when all this is done for them, it is their own fault, and not the fault of the system. Before Lucy went back to Newnham she went into the little room—her own room till she had left it for Newnham—where the Master\u0027s wife had gone to lie down to rest. She had chosen this room because it was near the Master\u0027s, and she would be within call. [Pg 203] Lucy insisted on undressing her and putting her to bed, and perjuring herself with fibs of the deepest dye to set her mind at rest. \u0027I never thought he would go before me,\u0027 the dear old soul murmured, when Lucy was undressing her. \u0027I always thought I should go first; and it has been such a comfort to me to think that Mary could fill my place so well. And now to think that he should be called away first!\u0027 \u0027Who said he would go first?\u0027 Lucy said in her reassuring manner. \u0027He is not at all likely to go before you, you poor dear! If you had been yourself, he would not have fallen. You had no strength left, so he slipped through your poor arms. You hadn\u0027t the strength of a baby. Anyone can see how you have been failing lately, and you think it is the Master.\u0027 \u0027And you think it was my fault he fell—that the weakness was not in him?\u0027 the poor trembling old creature asked eagerly. She was so anxious to believe Lucy, and the faint colour flushed up under her white skin. [Pg 204] \u0027Of course it was. The doctor will not tell you it was, because he doesn\u0027t want to frighten you. Anyone can see that you are much weaker than the Master.\u0027 There really seemed some truth in what Lucy said. The Master\u0027s wife was trembling all over like a leaf—she couldn\u0027t have got into bed without Lucy\u0027s help; but she was trembling with joy. \u0027God bless you, my dear!\u0027 she said, when the girl went away. \u0027You have made me so happy!\u0027 Lucy went back to Newnham with a heavy heart. It seemed as if everything were slipping away from her. It is so hard for the young to realize the great change. She felt dimly that it was not far off—that this was, indeed, the beginning of the end. Anyone could have seen that. But it was not the personal sorrow of it that moved her; there was a deeper pathos than death in the fidelity of the dear woman who clung to the old Master with a love stronger than death itself.[Pg 205] She could not but think of the look of relief on the old tired face as she walked back to Newnham. The girls remarked that Lucy looked pale at Hall—that is, those who took any interest in her. Pamela Gwatkin never looked her way. She sat at the \u0027High,\u0027 among the Dons; she never condescended to look down the hall to the table where the freshers sat. Capability Stubbs came into her room after Hall, as she sat trying to work, and brought her in a cup of tea. The tea was very grateful to Lucy\u0027s overwrought nerves: it was the only thing that was nice about Miss Stubbs. Pamela Gwatkin had given her a cup of tea once or twice, but it tasted of tooth-powder. She had packed the tea and the tooth-powder in a biscuit-tin when she came up, and the lid had got off the tooth-powder box, and it had got mixed up with the tea. It would not have been political economy to have thrown it away. \u0027Nice scandal you\u0027ve been making in the college!\u0027 observed Miss Stubbs cheerfully, as she handed Lucy the teacup. She had only brought a teacup;[Pg 206] she considered saucers superfluous, unless one happened to be a kitten. \u0027Scandal!\u0027 said Lucy, aghast. \u0027What scandal have I been making?\u0027 \u0027Oh! it was rumoured you had eloped with a Selwyn man. Somebody saw you going off.\u0027 \u0027With a Selwyn man!\u0027 said Lucy with fine scorn. \u0027As if I should elope with a Selwyn man! If it had been St. Benedict\u0027s it would have been different.\u0027 \u0027Or Hall?\u0027 suggested Miss Stubbs, who was rumoured to have a cousin at Trinity Hall, or to know a girl who had. \u0027Ye—es; even Hall would have been better. Who set the ball rolling—Newnham Assurance?\u0027 Lucy was much too angry with Pamela to call her by her name. \u0027No, it wasn\u0027t Assurance. She took the other side. She said if you were going to run away with—with a man, you would have had the self-respect to stop and put your gloves on first.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2909/80080.html","bookId":1099,"book":{"id":1099,"title":"The master of St. Benedict\u0027s","description":"简介： The success and the distinction had come early in life, and the love had come late.
