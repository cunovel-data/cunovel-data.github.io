{"id":10869,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. \u0027THAT CONFOUNDED CUCUMBER!\u0027","content":"Lucy didn\u0027t go to Wyatt Edgell\u0027s room again. She caught sight of the friendly bed-maker once or twice on the staircase when she went to Mr. Colville\u0027s room to be coached in mathematics, and she held a little whispered conference with her on the stairs. Edgell was better: he was up again and at work—working very hard, the woman said (and bed-makers know something about work). He was \u0027going on as quiet and as steady as any gentleman on the staircase.\u0027 This verdict from such a quarter was as good as a college testimonial. When there is a mixed University, and a lady President at the lodge, and a female Vice-Chan[Pg 149]cellor, and the affairs of the Senate are conducted by dowagers, bed-makers will no doubt be required to sign college testimonials. The first time Lucy saw Wyatt Edgell after that day when she put the wet bandage round his head, and promised to pick up the dreadful thing Eric had thrown out of window, and carry it away with her, was at the college chapel. It was a fortnight after the day when she had picked him out from among all the men of St. Benedict\u0027s as Pamela Gwatkin\u0027s brother. He was sitting in the same place, and he was very little changed; he was paler, Lucy thought, and he was muffled up round the throat for that warm May day. She couldn\u0027t help looking at him. Her eyes would wander over to the bench where he sat, do what she would to keep them fixed in quite an opposite direction. The Master took such a long time over the Litany that morning. He had read it for so many years in that college chapel, Sunday after Sunday, but he had never read it so slowly as he was read[Pg 150]ing it to-day. The men yawned and fidgeted as he read, and the old fellows in the stalls opposite looked across with grave, questioning eyes—they would have to elect another Master shortly—and the women-folk kneeling by his side looked up anxiously; but Lucy\u0027s eyes had wandered again to the end seat on the last bench, while her lips were murmuring: \u0027\"That it may please Thee to raise up them that fall, and finally to beat down Satan under our feet.\"\u0027 Wyatt Edgell looked up while she was praying for him—she was distinctly praying for him, she had prayed this very prayer for him every night and morning since Eric had told her how he needed her prayers—and their eyes met. Lucy was covered with confusion. She was quite sure in that swift momentary glance that he had read her inmost thoughts. She was ashamed that he should know that she had been praying all this time that he should be strengthened and comforted and helped and picked up again when he[Pg 151] fell, and that the enemy should be beaten down under his feet. She never looked at that end of the chapel again all the rest of the service. It was over at last—the long, long Litany and the slow, faltering prayers: the men need not have been so restless, they would not hear them much longer. The old walls would echo another voice soon, and the feeble lips would be repeating another Litany elsewhere. The old college chapel was full of echoes and shadows; there would be another shadow shortly, and the echo of a tremulous, quavering voice would join those other ancient echoes in the roof. It was a dark, gloomy old chapel; it had been built for hundreds of years, and it was full of old memories. Every bench and stall and desk had a memory of its own, stretching back, far back, into quite early ages—memories of old Masters and Fellows and scholars and undergraduates who had worshipped there through, oh! so many generations. There was a musty smell of old Masters rising up from the vaults beneath and pervading the chapel,[Pg 152] and in the ante-chapel beyond there were monuments on the walls, and brasses—quite lovely old brasses—on the pavement, and great hideous tombs of long dead and gone Masters and Fellows. It was touching to see how they were forgotten after a generation or two; how even their very tomb-stones were hidden away in a corner, and covered up with organ pipes. There was the marble effigy of an old, old Master, whose learning and virtues were recited in a long Latin epitaph on an elaborate tablet hidden away behind the organ. Everyone had forgotten him years ago, and his old monument was in the way, and so they had covered it up. Music is so much more delightful than old memories. They will all be swept away soon, and a new chapel will be built. There will be no old memories and old ghosts and old storied windows, no decaying woodwork or musty odour of old Masters. It will all be fresh and bright and sweet-smelling and shiny as new paint and varnish can make it, and there will be a new organ with electric stops. It will be dark and shadowy no[Pg 153] longer; the old echoes and the old ghosts will all be scared away—they will vanish quite away in the blaze of the new electric lamps with which the chapel will be lighted. Lucy vanished out of the college chapel almost as rapidly as the ghosts will by-and-by. She did not linger in the cloisters to-day. She hurried back to the lodge, and left Cousin Mary and the Master\u0027s wife to toddle back beside the Master. \u0027How do you think your uncle looks to-day, my dear?\u0027 the old lady asked Lucy when they had got him safely back to the lodge, and had put him in his great armchair, and given him some wine. There was a shade of anxiety in her voice as she asked the question. Lucy hadn\u0027t seen the Master for a week, so she might have been expected to notice any change in him. \u0027Oh, I think he looks lovely, aunt! He walked back from chapel quite strong.\u0027 Mrs. Rae shook her head; she was not quite convinced. \u0027There were two of us supporting him, my dear,[Pg 154] one on either side, and I thought he leant rather heavily.\u0027 He had nearly crushed the poor little soul into the ground; she could not have supported his weight a dozen steps more. \u0027Perhaps you are not so strong yourself to-day, auntie dear; you are looking pale. Most likely the weakness is yours, and you are not so well able to bear his weight. He always leans heavily; I often wonder how you and Mary can keep him up!\u0027 \u0027Perhaps so, my dear. I hope it may be so!\u0027 But still the cloud on the dear old face did not quite vanish. \u0027I fancied that his reading in chapel was slower to-day than usual—that his voice was weak. Did you notice it?\u0027 \u0027Oh yes; I noticed that he read lovely! I never heard him read so well as he read to-day.\u0027 \u0027You really think so? I am very glad! The fault must be in me. I don\u0027t think I am quite so strong to-day—I can\u0027t expect to be at my age; but I am very glad there is nothing unusual the matter with the Master. You would have been quite sure[Pg 155] to have noticed it, my dear, if there had been, as you haven\u0027t seen him for a week.\u0027 She kissed that mendacious little Lucy and tottered out of the room. She was very feeble to-day—perhaps the Master\u0027s weight had been too much for her; but there was quite a glad smile on her patient face. She was so happy, the brave old soul, to feel that the weakness was hers, not his. Wyatt Edgell went back straight from chapel to his own rooms. He met Eric coming out of chapel, and they went back together. \u0027Where have I seen that girl before?\u0027 he asked Eric when they got back to the room. \u0027Oh, you\u0027ve often seen her in chapel. She\u0027s the Master\u0027s niece, or grand-niece, or something of the kind,\u0027 said Eric evasively. But the other was not so easily put off. \u0027I have seen her somewhere else, besides in chapel,\u0027 he said thoughtfully. \u0027I\u0027ve seen her in this room. I\u0027ve seen her beside my bed. Good heavens! Wattles, you didn\u0027t let that girl in—when—when——\u0027 [Pg 156] \u0027When you weren\u0027t quite yourself, old man,\u0027 said Eric cheerfully, filling up the gap. \u0027What on earth should the Master\u0027s niece come in here for? Be reasonable, and don\u0027t ask such foolish things!\u0027 \u0027Foolish or not, I\u0027ll be hanged if I didn\u0027t see her in this room, standing where you stand now! You may as well tell the truth, Wattles. You may as well say you called her in and showed her the spectacle!\u0027 He was a very determined-looking young man, and he didn\u0027t look like one to be trifled with, as he stood with his back to the empty fireplace, leaning against the mantelpiece, and his great hands stuck down well in his pockets. \u0027Dear old man, you may take my word for it: I did not call her in; I should as soon have thought of calling the Master in!\u0027 \u0027I wish to Heaven you had called the Master in—I should have known the worst then; but for this girl to see me—in—in that state!\u0027 He paused and groaned, and two upright lines came out on his forehead. [Pg 157] \u0027You take too much for granted, old man,\u0027 said the other; but he couldn\u0027t put any heartiness into his voice. \u0027Haven\u0027t I told you that not a soul in the college but Brannan and myself came into the room—while—while you were ill?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the other moodily—\u0027not a soul in the college; but this girl from Newnham came in. I\u0027ll swear it! I saw it in her eyes.\u0027 It was no use Eric pretending. Edgell was not in a mood to be trifled with. He was a great big, determined fellow. He could have taken Eric up and flung him to the other end of the room with the same ease with which he had flung the pillow. \u0027Go on,\u0027 he said moodily; \u0027go on, and tell me all about it. Tell me why this girl came in, and the spectacle she saw. Let me know exactly the degradation to which I have sunk!\u0027 There was no help for it. Eric had to tell him all about Lucy\u0027s visit—Lucy\u0027s second visit; he didn\u0027t say anything about the first. How could he tell the poor fellow that she had come in at that dreadful time; that it was her hands that had[Pg 158] wiped up all the traces of his crime; that it was she who had helped him when he had put those stitches in that gaping wound in his throat! Eric told him quite enough. His head had fallen forward on his breast, and he looked a picture of despondency. A despondent giant of six feet, with a great broad chest, and big muscular limbs, and a splendid head splendidly set on a splendid full white throat—it was muffled up now, but it was as white and shapely as a woman\u0027s beneath the crisp, close-cut whisker curling down below the cheek. His chin and his great square jaw were close-shaven, but there was a thin, slight, crisp moustache on his upper lip, and his short hair curled crisply at the edges. He wore it parted in the middle, not very neatly parted, and tossed back off his forehead. Everything about him denoted strength and courage—such a man could not be despondent long. \u0027Then she knows the worst,\u0027 he said—\u0027the very worst. There is nothing else she has got to learn about me. There is only one thing to be done,[Pg 159] Wattles, with a girl who knows so much about me: I must marry her. You must introduce me again, old man, and I shall make her an offer, and—and she will marry me.\u0027 His gloom and depression had quite gone, and he was smiling again. He was a delightful fellow when he smiled. Not a man in the college could resist that delightful smile; it disarmed the wrath of all the Dons, and it won the hearts of bed-makers. \u0027Marry her!\u0027 said Eric, turning quite pale. \u0027Dear old man, don\u0027t be in such a hurry. Think it over. She isn\u0027t the sort of woman for you, Edgell.\u0027 Wyatt Edgell laughed. His laugh was a full-blown edition of his smile; but Gwatkin looked serious. \u0027Perhaps you\u0027ll tell me, Wattles, what is the sort of woman for me.\u0027 \u0027Oh, I wouldn\u0027t pretend to say; only, old man, don\u0027t trifle with this poor little thing. She\u0027s the sort of girl to break her heart for a man. I wouldn\u0027t break her heart if I were you.\u0027 [Pg 160] \u0027Perhaps she\u0027ll break mine,\u0027 said Edgell dryly; and then he sat down and ate his lunch which the bed-maker had already spread out on the table. It was a very nice college lunch. It was not tinned beef, or brawn, or tongue, or any questionable dainty that had been soldered up a year or two in a metal case. It was a lovely head and shoulders of salmon, and it had been judiciously pickled, and there was cucumber cut up in a dish—little delicate flakes of cucumber which Edgell ate with the healthy returning appetite of a man who had long been denied this delicacy. The salmon was followed by a chicken and a ham, to which he also applied himself with the same zest. The edge was quite taken off his appetite, when Eric pushed these things aside and set a jelly just freshly turned out of a mould before him. \u0027I don\u0027t want any of that stuff,\u0027 he said, and he pushed over his glass in the direction of the claret. \u0027I don\u0027t think I\u0027d take any more, old man,\u0027[Pg 161] said Eric; \u0027you\u0027ve already had four glasses. I wouldn\u0027t have any more. Have a soda?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll be hanged if I do!\u0027 said the other doggedly, \u0027unless you put some brandy in it. I must have a nip of brandy, Wattles. I\u0027m sure that cucumber has disagreed with me. I haven\u0027t had any cucumber for an age, and it never did agree with me.\u0027 Eric got up and unlocked a cupboard, and took out a liqueur-bottle more than half full of brandy, and poured a small—a very small—quantity into a glass, and filled it up with seltzer-water. He had put the bottle back into the cupboard and the key into his pocket, and was putting on his gown to go out. He always took a service somewhere in the country, or did some open-air preaching on Sunday afternoons, and he was in a hurry to get away. \u0027I wish you\u0027d leave that key behind you, Wattles,\u0027 Edgell called out when he got to the door. \u0027That confounded cucumber or the pickled salmon has disagreed with me. I may want the key before you come back.\u0027 [Pg 162] Eric took the key out of his pocket reluctantly and laid it on the mantelpiece. \u0027You\u0027ll be careful, old man,\u0027 he said; \u0027you\u0027ll be sure to be careful. Remember——\u0027 \u0027Shut up!\u0027 said the other angrily. \u0027Do you think I\u0027m such a fool?\u0027 Eric went out and shut the door. When he came back two hours later the liqueur-bottle was on the table empty, and Edgell was breathing heavily on the floor. It was all that confounded pickled salmon and cucumber! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2909/80077.html","bookId":1099,"book":{"id":1099,"title":"The master of St. Benedict\u0027s","description":"简介： The success and the distinction had come early in life, and the love had come late.
