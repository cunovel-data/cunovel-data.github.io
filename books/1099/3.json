{"id":10862,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. ONLY A FRESHER.","content":"It was rather hard work to persuade the old Master of St. Benedict\u0027s that Lucy ought to go to Newnham. He belonged to the old school—he was almost the last left of that school—that did not believe very much in women. He believed in a girl learning to sew, and to spell, and play a little air on the piano—he was very fond of \u0027Annie Laurie,\u0027 he could listen to it by the hour; he went so far, indeed, as the three R\u0027s in a woman\u0027s education—and he stopped there. He had no sympathy whatever in the movement for the higher education of Women—spelt with a big W. He had voted consistently all his life against women being admitted to any of the[Pg 35] privileges of the University, against their being allowed to take degrees; he had even voted against their being \u0027placed.\u0027 He regarded every concession made to the weaker sex as a step towards that dreadful time when a female Vice-Chancellor will confer degrees in the Senate House, and a lady D.D. will occupy the University pulpit. With these views, and with his prejudices growing stronger rather than weaker with the years, it was no wonder that Mary Rae had great difficulty in reconciling the Master to the idea of Lucy becoming a student of Newnham. He had to look at the question all round, from every point of view, and he had to talk it over a great many times. Sometimes he talked it over with himself after dinner, when he woke up from his nap, or didn\u0027t quite wake up; and sometimes he talked it over with his nieces. \u0027I don\u0027t think your father would approve of it, my dear,\u0027 he said one day when he was talking \u0027it\u0027 over with Lucy. \u0027He was a plain man, he hadn\u0027t the advantages of education that I had; but he had[Pg 36] what served him just as well, he had common-sense. He knew what was wanted in a woman. A woman, he used to say, ought to be able to milk, and make butter, and bring up a family. Dick\u0027s wife could do all these, and her poultry was noted in all the country round.\u0027 Lucy sighed. She had no ambition to make butter and bring up a family, and she had a distinct aversion to poultry. She hated cocks and hens and broods of yellow downy chickens. She remembered how they used always to be getting into the Vicarage garden and digging up her flower-seeds. \u0027I am afraid I couldn\u0027t get my living by making butter, uncle,\u0027 she said meekly, \u0027or milking cows.\u0027 She never could remember to say \u0027Master,\u0027 like everybody else. \u0027No, my dear, no; I suppose not. Some girls have the knack of it, and some women, I\u0027ve heard my mother say, may churn for hours and the butter will refuse to come. Dick\u0027s wife, your mother, my dear——\u0027 [Pg 37] \u0027Great-grandmother,\u0027 murmured Lucy almost inaudibly. The Master hated to be contradicted, and he was always telling her that these far-off ancestors were her father and mother, this humble ploughman and his homely wife. There had been two generations of culture between, and Lucy had quite forgotten, until her uncle reminded her, that her great-grandmother used to carry her eggs and her butter to market. The worst of it was he used to tell everybody it was her mother. \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 the Master repeated testily; \u0027my memory is not what it was. But it does not much matter which. She was a good woman; she did her duty here; she brought up a long family—nine children—and she has gone to her reward. She did not know a word of Greek or Latin, and she only knew enough mathematics to reckon up the price of eggs; but if she had gone to Girton or Newnham she could not have done more. She did her duty here; after all, that is the great thing, my dear. There is nothing else that will bring comfort at the last.\u0027 [Pg 38] It was a delightful reflection. It comforted the old scholar who had done his duty in this place for over sixty years, who had done it so well that by common consent men called him Master; but it didn\u0027t comfort Lucy at all. She was quite prepared to do her duty, only she wanted to do it in her own way. There were other difficulties in the way of Lucy going to Newnham beside the Master\u0027s prejudices. There was a dreadful ordeal to be gone through before those sacred portals would be opened to admit her. There was the entrance examination. The Senior Tutor was as good as his word; he brought Lucy over the very next day, not only the papers set at the last \u0027Previous\u0027 examination, but a copy of the last Newnham entrance papers. The next examination was to take place in March, and it was now the middle of February, and there were only a few weeks to prepare for it. Lucy looked hurriedly through the papers while the Tutor stood by, and he saw her face fall and[Pg 39] the pretty April colour, which was Lucy\u0027s especial charm, go out of her cheeks. \u0027They are stiffer than you thought,\u0027 he said. He couldn\u0027t help putting a little feeling into his voice; he couldn\u0027t help being sorry for the girl. He could see she was dreadfully disappointed. \u0027I did not think they would be so hard,\u0027 she said, with something like a sob, and striving to keep back the tears; \u0027I had no idea that so much was required.\u0027 Her voice was scarcely steady, and she finished up with a little wail—she couldn\u0027t keep it out of her voice—and she laid the papers down. \u0027You don\u0027t think you can do them?\u0027 \u0027No, I am sure I can\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Not if you work hard—very hard?—you have three weeks before you—not if I help you?\u0027 \u0027You! Oh, Mr. Colville!\u0027 The colour leaped back into her face, and her eyes brightened. She was quite trembling with eagerness. \u0027If you think with three weeks\u0027 hard work you can get through, I will help you,\u0027 he said. [Pg 40] It was something new to the Senior Tutor to have a pupil so eager and willing. The eyes of the undergraduates of St. Benedict\u0027s were not accustomed to brighten or their cheeks to flush when he proposed to give them a few hours\u0027 extra coaching. \u0027I am sure I can!\u0027 she said eagerly; \u0027and—and you are sure, Mr. Colville, you will not mind the trouble? I am a very slow learner, but I will do my best, my very best.\u0027 \u0027I am sure you will,\u0027 he said; and then he noticed that little helpless quivering about her lips that touched him with quite a new sensation. He had never seen Mary\u0027s lips quiver. \u0027It will be no trouble,\u0027 the Tutor said softly in quite a different voice; he even noticed the difference himself, with a strange sense of wonder. \u0027I shall be very glad to be of use to you.\u0027 He had often been of use to Mary. She always consulted him about the college business; she made use of him every day; but his voice had never faltered nor his cheek grown warm when he had[Pg 41] offered to help her with the Master\u0027s correspondence. Lucy began her work the next day. She turned out from the little shabby box she had brought with her to the lodge some well-thumbed old school-books. Small as the box was, it contained all her personal belongings, and the books were at the bottom of the box. Like Jacob, she had come into a strange land with very little personal impedimenta. It could all, everything, be stuffed into one small box, and the books were at the bottom. The books were shabby, like the box. They had belonged to her father, and she had read them with him. There were his old Virgil and Xenophon, and a dilapidated Euclid with all the riders missing, and an old-fashioned Algebra. There had been newer editions since Richard Rae had used these in his college days more than twenty years ago. There had been delightful editions full of notes, and directing-posts along the royal road to a classical education; but Lucy had been plodding along the old, rough, dusty way. [Pg 42] The Senior Tutor smiled as he turned over these old books. They brought back to him the old days twenty years ago, the hopes and dreams of those early days, and the familiar faces. The dreams had been realized—at least, some of them—but the familiar faces had faded with the years, and the hopes—what could a man hope for beyond being Master of his college? Nevertheless, the Senior Tutor sighed. The sight of these old books had carried him a long way back. \u0027I think we can find some newer editions than these,\u0027 he said, smiling. He not only found some newer, but he found the very newest. He found delightful books that smoothed away all the difficulties and made stony places plain. There will be a royal road to learning by-and-by. The road is getting smoother every day, and the way is getting shorter—a short, straight, macadamized road that one can travel over without any jolting or sudden pulls-up. Old scholars who remember the dear old rough road, and the stony ways, and the hills of difficulty[Pg 43] they had to climb, sigh when they look back. There is no time now, in these hurrying days, to toil over stones and climb unnecessary heights. The new ways are so much better than the old; but the old men, if they were to begin again, would go the old way, the dear old way, with all its difficulties. They will still tell you the old ways are best. Lucy Rae was not a scholar yet, though the desire of her heart was to be one—a perfect Hypatia—and the new royal road was exactly what she wanted. She made such rapid progress by means of these short-cuts and easy paths the Senior Tutor led her through that she was quite ready for that dreaded entrance examination when it came. She did as well in it as the girls who had been working for it for years. There was nothing now to prevent her becoming a student of Newnham. Cousin Mary had talked the old Master over and smoothed away all the difficulties. She had wrung from him an unwilling[Pg 44] consent. The Senior Tutor had done his part, too, in overcoming the Master\u0027s prejudices. He had backed Mary up in the most loyal manner; no girl could have had better advocates. When the Doctor had urged that there had been no precedent in his family of girls construing Latin and Greek when they ought to be making butter and carrying their eggs to market, the Tutor had reminded him that neither had there been a precedent in all the generations of the Raes of one of their number being the Master of a college. He, on his part, had set up a precedent, and Dick\u0027s little daughter was going to set up another—perhaps a more astonishing precedent. Lucy Rae went up to Newnham the next term. She ought to have waited until October, when the academical year commences, but she was much too anxious to begin at once. She couldn\u0027t wait till October. She had taken a little draught of the divine nectar, and she was thirsting to drink deeply, ever so deeply—deeper than any woman had ever drunk[Pg 45] yet. She was going to do very big things, and she couldn\u0027t afford to lose a minute. She would gain a whole term\u0027s work if she went up now, she would get in ten terms\u0027 work instead of nine, like the men, for her Tripos. She would get a whole term\u0027s start of them. With this thirst upon her, and this emulation stirring in her heart, Lucy packed her little box and carried it up to Newnham. She did not exactly carry it in her arms like a housemaid going to a new place. It was not far to carry it, and for the weight of it she might have carried it easily, but girls do not generally go to Newnham carrying a bandbox, or a bundle tied up in a coloured pocket-handkerchief, and with two out-at-elbow little brothers lagging behind carrying a shabby box between them. Lucy, alas! had not two out-at-elbow little brothers, and she had respect for the feelings of Newnham, so she drove up to the door of Newe Hall in a hansom, with her modest little box on the roof. She thought it was the happiest, the proudest[Pg 46] day of her life, this first day at Newnham. She had been looking forward to it for weeks. She had lain awake all the night before picturing what it would be like, and it was not the least like anything she had pictured. She had pictured sunshine and a blue sky, and the lilacs in the hedge budding, and the daffodils blowing beneath the windows. It was the middle of April, and she had a right to expect these things; it was very little to expect. It had been raining cheerfully all the morning, and it was raining still when the hansom drew up at the gate of St. Benedict\u0027s; it couldn\u0027t draw up at the door of the lodge, because college lodges are cut off from the outside world by cloistered courts, and even royalty, when it visits the master of a college, has to leave its carriage at the gate and perform the rest of the journey on foot. Lucy met Mr. Colville in the cloisters as she was hurrying through, and he put her into the hansom, and he told the man where to drive, and quite a crowd of undergraduates, who had come up early[Pg 47] in the term, stood round the gate watching her drive away. It was quite a new thing, a girl going from St. Benedict\u0027s to Newnham. It was the newest thing under the sun. No daughter, niece or granddaughter of any Master of St. Benedict\u0027s had ever driven from those gates before to Newnham. Perhaps when there is a mixed University, and a female president at the lodge, they will not have to go so far; they may find rooms beneath the same roof. Who shall say? Lucy couldn\u0027t have driven away with more depressing surroundings. The sky couldn\u0027t have been grayer, and the trees were shivering overhead, and the hedges were dripping, and there was a nasty mist settling down over everything. She forgot all about the lilacs and the daffodils she had been picturing as she stood, a forlorn little black figure, in the big, cheerless vestibule of Newe Hall, paying the driver of the hansom. There was no one at Newnham to receive her, no one to show[Pg 48] her to her room, only a housemaid, who went away directly she reached the door. She didn\u0027t even open the door of the room; she only pointed to it and went away in another direction. It was a little bare room, it couldn\u0027t have been barer. There was a couch that served for a bed, a bureau with some drawers beneath, a table, a couple of chairs, and a thinly disguised washstand with imperfect crockery; and that was all. Unless, indeed, a chintz curtain drawn across a corner of the room for hanging gowns behind could be called a wardrobe. There was no fire, and the barred windows were steaming and blurred with the mist outside, and the raw spring afternoon was closing in. Lucy shivered and looked round the desolate room. She didn\u0027t know what she was expected to do next, or how she was to begin this new life. She was a member of the University now, she told herself with bated breath; she was really a female undergraduate, and she had got to begin as undergraduates began. [Pg 49] Should she begin with lighting the fire? While she was debating this point, and drawing off her gloves, a girl came in. She had left the door open so that anyone passing could look in and see her standing there, and the girl passing by looked in and saw her, and something in her attitude touched her, and she came in. Perhaps it was her black frock and her white face. \u0027Can I do anything for you?\u0027 she said. She didn\u0027t throw any sympathy into her voice; they never do at Newnham. \u0027I\u0027ve got a kettle boiling if you\u0027d like some water, or\u0027—looking round the bare room and seeing that Lucy\u0027s things were not unpacked—\u0027perhaps you\u0027d rather have some tea.\u0027 \u0027Ye—es,\u0027 Lucy said quite thankfully; \u0027I would rather have some tea, please.\u0027 \u0027Then come into my room.\u0027 Lucy followed the girl, a solid-looking girl with no profile to speak of, and a turned-up nose and violent red hair. She had not to follow her far, only across the passage. [Pg 50] There was a card slipped into a frame in the door of the room, and the name of the occupant was written on it—\u0027Stubbs.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s my name,\u0027 said the girl, pointing to it; \u0027Maria Stubbs—Capability Stubbs they call me. I suppose you are a fresher?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027I\u0027m a fresher; I\u0027ve only just come up. My name is Rae—Lucy Rae.\u0027 \u0027Not a bad name; but you won\u0027t have any use for it here. They\u0027ll call you Lucifer most likely; they don\u0027t call anybody by their right name here.\u0027 Maria Stubbs\u0027 room was unlike most Newnham rooms. It was distinctly utilitarian. There was nothing ?sthetic about it. The most prominent thing in it was a bookshelf full of books, and there was a cabinet in one corner with a lot of narrow drawers, which Lucy found out after were crammed with specimens. A bright fire was burning in the little tiled grate, and a cloth was spread, and some tea-things were laid on the flap of the bureau, which was let down for the purpose, and there were some cakes in one of the pigeon-holes. [Pg 51] \u0027Take off your hat and sit down,\u0027 said Maria, drawing a low chair to the fire; \u0027there\u0027s nothing to hurry for, they won\u0027t bring in your things for a long time; they never hurry themselves at Newnham.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think I ought to take off my things until I\u0027ve seen someone,\u0027 said Lucy. \u0027There\u0027s Miss Wrayburne I certainly ought to see. Perhaps she doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m here.\u0027 The girl laughed—or cackled, rather; there wasn\u0027t the least fun in her laugh. \u0027Perhaps not,\u0027 she said, as she busied herself about making the tea; \u0027and I don\u0027t think it would make any difference if she did. You don\u0027t think the Dons are running about the college all day long shaking hands with the girls? You\u0027ll see Miss Wrayburne at the \"High\" at dinner, and she\u0027ll say \"How d\u0027ye do?\" and smile—she always smiles—and that\u0027s all.\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t know,\u0027 Lucy said humbly. \u0027I\u0027m only a fresher, you see; I shall know better soon. But it struck me as a very chilling reception.\u0027 [Pg 52] Miss Stubbs cackled in her unfeeling way. \u0027Chilling! that\u0027s lovely! You\u0027ve come to the wrong place if you expect any warmth at Newnham, or sympathy either. It would be nothing better than a big girls\u0027 school if we were always \"How-d\u0027ye-doing\" and shaking hands with each other—we should get to kissing soon! Thank goodness there is no spooning here! We are barely civil to each other; and we make a point of ignoring everybody if we meet \u0027em out-of-doors. I hope you won\u0027t, on the strength of this tea, nod to me if you happen to run against me in the street, because I shan\u0027t notice you.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Lucy, \u0027I certainly won\u0027t nod to you.\u0027 She didn\u0027t say it at all humbly, but she drank Miss Stubbs\u0027 tea. It was very good tea for Newnham.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2909/80070.html","bookId":1099,"book":{"id":1099,"title":"The master of St. Benedict\u0027s","description":"简介： The success and the distinction had come early in life, and the love had come late.
