{"id":10860,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. FULL OF DAYS, RICHES, AND HONOUR.","content":"The Master of St. Benedict\u0027s had got as much out of life as most men. His had been a longer life than is allotted to many men—it had exceeded four score. There had been room in these eight decades for all the things that men desire: for ambition, for wealth, for the world\u0027s favour, for success—well-earned success—and for love. There had also been distinction, and the soft, delightful voice of praise had not been silent. [Pg 2] The success and the distinction had come early in life, and the love had come late. In the nature of things it could not have come earlier. It came in time to crown the rest of the good gifts that Providence had poured into the lap of the Master of St. Benedict\u0027s. It had been his already for twenty years, and it was his still. Surely we are right in saying that he had got as much out of life as most men? He had begun life on a bleak Yorkshire moor, following the plough over his father\u0027s fields. A kindly North Riding vicar, noting the boy\u0027s taste for reading, and his inaptitude for the drudgery of the farm, had placed him at his own cost at the grammar school of the adjoining town. With a small scholarship the Yorkshire ploughboy came up to Cambridge. He came up with a very few loose coins in the pocket of his homely-cut clothes, and with a broad North-country dialect as barbarous as the cut of his coat. He was the butt of all the witty men of St. Benedict\u0027s during his freshman\u0027s year. He was[Pg 3] the subject of all the rough practical jokes which undergraduates in old days were wont to play upon impecunious youths who had the audacity to elbow them out of the highest places in the examinations. He had survived the practical jokes, and he had stayed \u0027up\u0027 when the witty men had gone \u0027down.\u0027 He had won the highest honours of his year, and in due course he had been promoted to a college Fellowship. Everything had come in delightful sequence: honour, riches, distinction, love. It had all fallen out exactly as he would have had it to fall out. He might have liked the love to have come earlier—he had waited for it forty years: it came at sixty, and he had enjoyed it for over twenty years! When Anthony Rae had come up to Cambridge, a poor scholar from a country grammar school, he had set before himself two things that seemed at the time equally impossible. He had set before himself the winning of a high place, perhaps the highest, among the great scholars of his great[Pg 4] University, and he had also set before himself—in his secret heart—the hope of winning, to share this distinction with him, the daughter of the kind friend who had paved the way to distinction and honour. He had achieved both these things—the dearest wishes of his heart—but he had to serve a longer apprenticeship than most men. He had to wait forty years. Rachel Thorne was worth waiting for. She was a child when he went away to college; she had run down to the Vicarage gate after him on that memorable morning to wish him \u0027good luck,\u0027 and she had stood watching him until a turn of the road hid him from her eyes. She had watched for him turning that corner many times since. She had met him at the gate of the dear old Yorkshire Vicarage when he came back, term after term, a modest undergraduate blushing beneath his well-earned honours, with the eager question on her lips: \u0027What great things, have you done this term, Anthony?\u0027 [Pg 5] She always expected him to do great things, and he justified her faith in him. Perhaps her girlish faith had more to do with his success than he dreamed of. It was his beacon through all his lonely hours, and it had led him onward to distinction and honour. She was brown-haired and fresh-cheeked when he went away; she was a middle-aged woman, with silver streaks in her brown hair, when he came back and asked her to share with him the honours he had won. She waited for him through all the long years of his Fellowship—sad years when fortune had left her and sorrow had baptized her—sad friendless years, growing older, and grayer, and sick with waiting. But the reward had come at last, and her tranquil face had regained its cheerfulness, and was \u0027no longer wan and dree.\u0027 It was a fitting crown to a scholarly life, this mellow, mature love—this gracious presence pervading the closing decades of his brilliant career. [Pg 6] Rachel Rae had been mistress of St. Benedict\u0027s over twenty years when our story opens. She had presided over the graceful hospitalities of the Master\u0027s lodge in her kindly, gracious way for twenty years. She had no daughter to share this delightful duty with her—she had married too late in life—but a niece of the Master\u0027s had been an inmate of the lodge for fifteen years or more, and filled a daughter\u0027s place. Mary Rae was a daughter of a younger brother of Dr. Rae\u0027s, and had been educated above the station in which she had been born by her uncle\u0027s liberality. Anthony Rae in his prosperity had not neglected his humble kinsfolk. He had done as much for them as lay in his power. He had educated the younger branches, and provided for the declining years of the elders. He had kept his two maiden sisters, one an invalid, in comfort and affluence. He had paid the mortgage off the farm and passed it over unembarrassed by debt to his elder brother. He had taken that brother\u0027s grandson and given him an education at his own[Pg 7] University, and in due time had arranged for him to be presented with a college living. It was not a rich living: it was the only one that fell vacant when Richard Rae most wanted it, and he had accepted it gladly. He had married upon it, and brought up a family, six children, of whom one only was now living, a girl child, with whom this story has to do. The old Master of St. Benedict\u0027s had aged perceptibly within the last few years. He was already in his second childhood. His strength had become enfeebled and his memory impaired. He could not walk down the long gallery of the lodge now or across the grass in the Fellows\u0027 garden without assistance; he could not remember the things of yesterday or of last week, but the crabbed characters of his old Semitic manuscripts were still as familiar to him as ever. He had lost a great deal since that stroke of paralysis five years ago, but he had not lost all. He remembered his old friends, and he could pore over his old books, but he was dependent upon his womankind for many things—for most things. [Pg 8] Mary Rae opened his letters and conducted his correspondence. She had conducted it so long that she knew more about the college than the Master. She transacted all the college business that had to be transacted in the lodge, and when any public function required the Master\u0027s presence in the Senate House Mary Rae took him up to the door on her arm and brought him back. It was also rumoured that she instructed him how to vote. She was assisted in her responsible duties by the Senior Tutor of St. Benedict\u0027s, who would in the natural course of things succeed to the office of Master when it should fall vacant. Mary Rae was a handsome woman well on in the thirties. She was a woman who could not help looking handsome at any age, and the few gray hairs that had put in an appearance in the smooth brown bands drawn back from her broad forehead only added a new dignity to her mature beauty. Perhaps the Senior Tutor thought that they supplied the only touch lacking to make Mary Rae a perfect and ideal mistress of a college lodge. [Pg 9] It was whispered in the combination room, where the old Fellows met after their Hall dinner, and discussed the affairs of the college over their walnuts and their wine, that when the Master received his last preferment she would not have to pack up her small belongings and leave the lodge. It was one morning early in the Lent term that Mary Rae sat at breakfast in the cheerful bow-windowed room of the lodge. The Doctor\u0027s wife still presided over the breakfast table. She was younger than the Doctor, and had worn better. She was still active and cheerful—a bright, gentle, patient old soul, ever watchful and considerate for his comfort, and anticipating his every want. While Mrs. Rae poured out the Master\u0027s tea, Mary Rae buttered the Master\u0027s toast and read his letters. There were not many letters this morning, but there was one with a black seal that lay uppermost. The writing was unfamiliar, and before opening it Mary glanced at the postmark. \u0027A letter from Dick, uncle,\u0027 she said across the table. She had to speak in rather a high key, as[Pg 10] the Doctor was a little deaf, and some days he was deafer than usual. \u0027What does Dick say, my dear?\u0027 he said, smiling at her across the toast she had buttered for him. His voice was not very strong, but there was no North-country burr in it now—a kind, mellow old voice, courteous and gentle in tone, with a quaver in it now and then. \u0027I have not heard from your uncle Dick for a long time. I am very glad he has written now. I cannot remember when I last heard from him.\u0027 \u0027It is not from Uncle Dick,\u0027 said Mary, opening the letter; \u0027it is from his son—at least, his grandson—Cousin Dick, of Thorpe Regis. Don\u0027t you remember, uncle?\u0027 \u0027Ye—es, my dear; and what does Dick say?\u0027 Mary read the letter in silence, and looked across the table with a shade of anxiety on her face. \u0027It is not Cousin Dick who writes; the letter is from his daughter; he had only one daughter—Lucy, little Lucy. You remember her, uncle?\u0027 [Pg 11] Mary Rae was evidently speaking to gain time, and the shade of anxiety deepened on her face as she spoke. \u0027Ye—es, I remember, my dear. Lucy was her mother\u0027s name; she was called after her mother. What has Lucy got to say about Dick?\u0027 \u0027She has not much to say, uncle; she is writing in great distress. Her father has died, almost suddenly. He was preaching a week ago, and now he is dead. The poor child is writing in great trouble.\u0027 \u0027Dick dead!\u0027 the old man repeated with a bewildered air, and putting down his cup with a shaking hand. \u0027Dick dead, did you say? He was not so many years older than I, and always hale and strong. I ought to have gone first. There were only three of us, and Dick was the eldest.\u0027 \u0027It isn\u0027t your brother, Anthony, that is dead; he died long ago, dear. It is his grandson, little Dick—Dickie you used to call him. You had him up here, and he took his degree, and you gave[Pg 12] him a college living. You remember little Dickie, Anthony?\u0027 His wife\u0027s voice recalled his wandering thoughts. \u0027Yes, yes, my dear; certainly, I remember little Dick very well. He took a second class; he ought to have done better. He disappointed me. I had no son of my own to come after me, and I should have liked my brother Dick\u0027s son—grandson, to be sure—to have done well. He did his best, no doubt; but he disappointed me. If he had done better, he might have got a Fellowship. So Dickie is dead, you say, my dear?\u0027 \u0027Yes, uncle; and he has left poor little Lucy unprovided for. She has written to ask you what she ought to do. She wants to go out as a governess—a nursery governess.\u0027 \u0027A nursery governess? Dick\u0027s little girl a nursery governess! No, my dear, that will never do. Tell her to come here; there\u0027s plenty of room in the lodge for Dick\u0027s little girl. Write to her at once, Mary, and tell her as soon—as soon as the funeral is over—her father\u0027s funeral—poor little[Pg 13] girl!—to come to the lodge. What do you say, Rachel?\u0027 \u0027I wish we could spare Mary to go to her,\u0027 the Master\u0027s wife said, wiping her eyes. \u0027Someone ought to fetch her away at once, as soon—as soon as it is all over. I think Mary ought to go to her.\u0027 The Senior Tutor met the Master\u0027s niece in the court as he was coming away from a lecture during the morning, and she told him all about the letter her uncle had received and the death of his nephew, or, rather, his grand-nephew. \u0027You remember my cousin Dick?\u0027 she said; \u0027he was my second cousin. I am a generation older than he,\u0027 and she smiled at the admission. She was not the least ashamed of her age. The Senior Tutor smiled too; he was thinking how well she wore her years, how her age, or the signs of it, her gray hairs and the lines on her face, became her. She would grow handsomer with the years, he told himself as he stood talking to her in the spring sunshine, and her face would grow finer as time went by: it was a fine face already; it[Pg 14] could never by any chance grow plain. He had watched a great many faces grow old in his time—old, and lined, and soured—but he had never seen any face grow finer with the years like this woman\u0027s face had grown. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, \u0027I remember your cousin, Richard Rae, very well; he was one of my pupils. He disappointed me, and he disappointed your uncle; he ought to have taken a first class. He went into the Church, and we gave him a college living, I remember—a very small living—and he married, I believe, directly after.\u0027 \u0027He married, and he had a large family and a sickly wife, and very small means. It must have been a hard struggle for him, poor Dick! He lost his wife, and his children died one after the other; there is only one left. And now he is dead, and the girl is left quite alone.\u0027 \u0027Oh, it is a girl,\u0027 said the Tutor in a tone of disappointment; \u0027if it had been a boy we could have done something with him here.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Mary, with a sigh; \u0027pity it\u0027s a girl;[Pg 15] it would have been so much easier if it had been a boy. She must come here, of course; there is nowhere else for her to go.\u0027 \u0027What will you do with her when she comes?\u0027 The Senior Tutor looked grave; the question had come into his head as he stood speaking to Mary, what should he do with this girl of Cousin Dick\u0027s when he occupied the Master\u0027s place? Of course Mary would stay, and Mrs. Rae—he could not separate the old woman from her niece during her few declining years; she would certainly remain an inmate of the lodge; but this girl? he could not make the college lodge an asylum for all the female members of the Rae family. It was an idiotic question to arise; he was ashamed of it the next moment. \u0027I think you ought to go to Thorpe Regis,\u0027 he said, \u0027and be with your poor young cousin at this trying time. I will look after the Master while you are away, if that will make the going easier.\u0027 \u0027Ye—es,\u0027 said Mary slowly, \u0027it will make it easier. You really think I ought to go?\u0027 [Pg 16] There was a hesitation in her tone he could not but note; he put it down at once to her reluctance to leave the old Master. \u0027Most certainly you ought to go,\u0027 he said promptly. \u0027I will come over to the lodge every day. I will fill your place as far as I can. You are not afraid to leave the Master with me?\u0027 \u0027Oh, no, no! I am sure you will do all, more than all, that I do for him. I was not thinking about him. You are quite sure it is right to bring this girl back here? She is very young, not twenty, and—and she may be——\u0027 \u0027She may be attractive,\u0027 said the Senior Tutor with a laugh, \u0027and turn all our heads. I think, in spite of her attractions, her place is here with you and under her uncle\u0027s roof. We must protect ourselves against the wiles of this siren. We must not wear our hearts on our sleeves for Cousin Dick\u0027s little daughter to peck at.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2909/80068.html","bookId":1099,"book":{"id":1099,"title":"The master of St. Benedict\u0027s","description":"简介： The success and the distinction had come early in life, and the love had come late.
