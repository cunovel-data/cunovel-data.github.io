{"id":10870,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI. IN THE FELLOWS\u0027 GARDEN.","content":"That mendacious little Lucy, in spite of all her assurances to the Master\u0027s wife, was a little anxious about the Master. He had not taken his dinner with his usual appetite; he had scarcely eaten a morsel, and he had not had his usual nap after. He had left half the wine in his glass, and he had got up from the table earlier than usual; but he had not fallen asleep in his chair after, as was his wont. He had sat talking to Lucy all the afternoon about the old time. His memory was wonderfully clear about the things that had happened, oh! so long ago—more than half a century before she was born—and he talked to her about them as if they had happened yesterday. [Pg 164] He was always so glad to see Cousin Dick\u0027s little daughter; she brought back the past to him, and seemed a link between the old far-off time and the present. He recalled to-day his very earliest years, his first remembrances. He recalled the time when his brother Dick carried him on his shoulders to the fair. \u0027It was Midsummer Fair, my dear,\u0027 he explained, \u0027and your father left off work early; he was very fond of fairs, and junketings, and wrestling matches. He liked bull-baiting, too. I mind the bull-ring at the end of the village on a piece of waste ground; I dare say it is there now. I\u0027ve seen many a bull baited there in my day. There was never a fair within ten miles but your father was there in his best, with a flower in his button-hole—he always wore a flower in the button-hole of his plum-coloured coat. I remember that coat well; it had gilt buttons, and he wore a waistcoat to match, with two rows of buttons on either side—it was the fashion then, my dear. He carried me on his shoulder all the way to the fair; it was[Pg 165] held on the green; there was a large green in the middle of the village in those days, but it is built over now; things have altered since then.\u0027 The old Master shook his head and sighed. He hated changes of any kind; he would have liked the world to go on in the same old grooves for ever. He was silent for some time, and his watchful women-folk thought he was going to sleep—that he would have his after-dinner nap, after all; but he was only thinking. Those old chambers of memory were unlocked, and the old faces of his youth were crowding around him. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said presently, brightening up, \u0027your mother was there, too, my dear. Dick met her in a dancing-booth. She wouldn\u0027t look at Dick at first, she had so many sweethearts. She was a proud little thing, with a spirit of her own; she nearly broke Dick\u0027s heart before he married her, but she made him a good wife—a good wife and a good mother, and always in her place in church, and bringing her children up to work and to fear[Pg 166] God. I don\u0027t know that women do more in these days when they learn so many things.\u0027 Lucy couldn\u0027t help thinking of that motion in the House of Commons, which was carried with such an overwhelming majority, that was to admit women to practise at the Bar and in the Church, to say nothing of those other learned professions that were already practically open. The old Master\u0027s views were very, very old-fashioned; the world had made rapid strides while he had been sitting in his armchair and reading his Sunday Litanies in that musty old college chapel. \u0027Your father had a spirit of his own, too, my dear,\u0027 the old man babbled on with quite surprising vigour—these old memories made him quite young again; \u0027he wouldn\u0027t stay there to be slighted, with all the neighbours looking on. He left your mother going round with a young spark who had come down from London, and with me on his shoulder he went through the fair. I mind the booths quite well, with the gilt gingerbread, and[Pg 167] the toys, and the trumpets, and the drums, and the merry-go-rounds. There was a show with a fat woman—I have never forgotten that fat woman. I have never seen anything like her since. There was a dwarf there, too—the smallest dwarf that was ever seen. I remember him strutting about the stage with his little sword; he wore a sword, and a gold-laced coat, and a cocked hat. The fat lady took his arm when the performance was over—she had to stoop down to do it, and he had to stretch up. I shall never forget seeing them go off the stage, arm-in-arm—the funniest sight I have ever seen—or how the people in the show laughed and clapped their hands when the showman made a ridiculous speech as they went out. \"That\u0027s the way they go to church every Sunday of their lives!\" he said, pointing after them. I believed him, if the crowd didn\u0027t, and for years after I used to watch the church door to see them coming in; but I have never seen them since.\u0027 Lucy was so anxious about the old Master that[Pg 168] when she went for her lesson to the Tutor\u0027s rooms the next day she could do nothing but talk about him. The Tutor was anxious too, perhaps, in another way. He had noticed a change in the Master, and he went over to the lodge with her as soon as the lesson was over. The Master was very feeble to-day, but he was up, and downstairs, and he was talking about going out into the garden. He was very fond of the old Fellows\u0027 Garden, and the seat beneath the walnut-tree—a sunny seat in the winter, a shady seat in the summer. It was shady now, but the garden was full of sunshine; the lilacs were in bloom, and the laburnums were a blaze of gold, and the thorn-tree was white with may. It was the blossoming time of the year, and everything was at its prime. The Tutor took him out on his arm and sat him down on his old seat. He noticed how heavily he leant upon him as he tottered feebly across the grass. He would have crushed a woman with his[Pg 169] weight. The Master\u0027s wife came out too, and sat by his side, with his hand in hers, and Lucy walked with the Tutor in the shady, winding paths beneath the trees. The trees were all old and gnarled, and some had broken down with age, and were propped up. The borders were full of old-fashioned flowers—perennials that went down into the earth every winter, and came up again every spring. There was nothing new here. The Senior Tutor, as he walked by Lucy\u0027s side, was thinking how he should change all this by-and-by. He would cut down those useless old trees, and he would have the turf rolled and laid out for tennis. Nothing could be better for Lucy than tennis, and she could invite her Newnham friends. Those old flower borders should be all dug up, and some standard rose-trees planted. He would have nothing but first-rate sorts, the very latest. He would do away with that vulgar cabbage rose in the corner, and that poor, shabby little pale blush that hung in clusters on the wall. It had hung there for so many years; it was quite[Pg 170] time it should be cleared away. It seemed a pity to lose time. There were so many improvements to be made; it seemed a pity not to begin now. Looking across the grass and the sunshine at the old stooping figure under the walnut-tree—it was bent more than usual to-day—he could not but feel that the time was not far off when it would be there no longer. There was nothing pathetic in the sight to him. He had waited for the place—the Master\u0027s place—so long. If he waited much longer he would be feeble and old and white-haired, too. There is little pathos in the young. The sad realities of life touch only those who know something about them. One must have suffered one\u0027s self to have any sympathy with suffering. Lucy, looking across the sunshine, was touched, in spite of herself, at the group under the walnut-tree. It didn\u0027t affect her as it affected the Tutor. It would be no gain to her if the old Master were to die; it would mean loss and change and being driven out again homeless into the wide world. [Pg 171] But it was not this consideration that moved her. She was touched by the tender picture of the two brave, patient old souls sitting hand-in-hand in that calm closing evening of their life. Here was a love that Lucy knew nothing about—a love that had weathered all the storms of life, and was burning brightly at its close. Riches and honour and learning were nothing to it. They were the Master\u0027s still, but they were nothing beside love. He would leave these behind him, but love would cling to him out of time. He wouldn\u0027t shake that off when he shook off everything else. Lucy didn\u0027t put the idea into words, but it touched her; and then, strangely enough, rose up before her the face of the man who had sat on the last seat in the chapel and had caught her looking at him. It was quite ridiculous to think of Wyatt Edgell at such a moment; there was nothing here to remind her of him. There was an old disused greenhouse at the end of the Fellows\u0027 garden. Nothing had grown in it[Pg 172] for years. A neglected vine was dropping down from the roof in one corner, and a great deal of the glass was broken, and the woodwork was decayed and rotting. The Tutor shook the door as he passed, and it opened, and he paused and looked in. \u0027I think we must have this place rebuilt,\u0027 he said, thinking aloud. \u0027You would like a greenhouse. We must get some ferns and palms and foliage plants. Do you like foliage plants?\u0027 \u0027Not much,\u0027 Lucy said. She could not think what he meant by appealing to her. \u0027I like flowers best. I don\u0027t care for leaves. I\u0027m afraid my taste is very vulgar. I like geraniums, and mignonette, and camellias; I am very fond of camellias. We used to have some in our greenhouse at home.\u0027 \u0027You can keep as many as you like here,\u0027 he said. \u0027We will get all the varieties there are, and you can have geraniums in flower all the year round.\u0027 He shut the door, and they walked down the path together, while Lucy wondered what he could mean. It would be scarcely worth while to do up[Pg 173] the old greenhouse and fill it with flowers when it was not likely she would be there another spring to see it. In the long path they met Cousin Mary coming towards them. She looked rather pale and worn in the sunshine, and she had on a most unbecoming garden-hat. It had been hanging up in the hall all the winter; it might have been hanging there for years, and it was battered out of all shape. There was not a bed-maker in the college that would have worn it. The Tutor had never noticed before how gray her hair had grown, and that there were crow\u0027s-feet round her eyes, and that her cheeks were faded. She had not changed lately. She had looked like this for years, getting a little grayer every year, and adding a line or two beneath her eyes, but he had never noticed it before. He was very fond of her still; he had the highest opinion of Mary Rae, but he was very glad that Lucy had come in time—just in time—to save him from throwing himself away. [Pg 174] \u0027Mr. Colville is going to have the old greenhouse done up, Mary,\u0027 Lucy shouted to her when she was quite a dozen paces away. \u0027He\u0027s going to have camellias and geraniums all the year round; but perhaps you don\u0027t like camellias.\u0027 The Senior Tutor for once in his life blushed. It was not for Mary he was going to have those geraniums in perennial bloom. \u0027I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth it,\u0027 said Mary bluntly—\u0027at least, not for us. We shall soon be going away.\u0027 And she looked in the direction of the walnut-tree beneath which the old Master and his wife were still sitting. \u0027That should make no change,\u0027 the Tutor said awkwardly; \u0027the lodge would be still your home.\u0027 He grew ridiculously red, and he did not dare to look Mary in the face. \u0027We need not talk about that yet,\u0027 she said with a smile; \u0027the dear Master is still with us. I came to ask you to help him in; he has sat there long enough. He is not so strong to-day; I can\u0027t manage him alone.\u0027 [Pg 175] \u0027I should think not!\u0027 said the Tutor, and he hurried off across the grass and took the old Master back to the lodge. Lucy did not go in; she slipped through the garden-door into the court, and hurried back to Newnham. She had promised to drink tea in a girl\u0027s room, and she was already half an hour late. She went back by way of the Fens, and when she was near the bridge she saw some figures she thought she knew crossing it, and they stopped while she came up, and looked down into the water. It was Pamela Gwatkin and her brother, and there was another man with him. She had never seen Pamela with her brother before, and she was struck as she came up to them with the points of difference between them. Being twins, they ought to have been exactly alike. Eric was short, and Pamela was tall—tall and graceful and slender, as a girl ought to be, with a proud, self-reliant bearing that is peculiar to the students of a college for women. Eric was[Pg 176] not only short, but he was stout, and not at all graceful, and he had no bearing to speak of. He was an awkward, well-meaning, commonplace fellow. There was nothing remarkable about him whatever, except that he was Pamela\u0027s twin brother. This in his case was a decided disadvantage—the ingredients hadn\u0027t been properly mixed. All the masculine characteristics had gone to Pamela, and the tender, endearing qualities to her brother. He saw Lucy come tearing along across the Fen, and he took off his hat as she came up to him. \u0027You have met Eric before,\u0027 said Pamela, by way of introduction. She was looking very pink and white and cool as she stood there on the bridge looking down into the dark shady water, and Lucy had run herself into a fever, and was hot and flushed, and looking \u0027hideous,\u0027 as she told herself. \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 she panted—she was quite out of breath with running in the hot sun—\u0027I have met Mr. Gwatkin before.\u0027 [Pg 177] She didn\u0027t see, until Pamela\u0027s brother introduced her, that the other man leaning over the bridge was Wyatt Edgell. She was so flustered with running, and so taken by surprise, that she blushed like a peony. She felt she was blushing furiously, and that Pamela, cool and critical and self-possessed, was watching her. Oh, how she hated herself for not being cool and dignified and self-possessed like other people! They walked back over the Fen and through the lane to Newnham in couples, Lucy and Wyatt Edgell in front, Pamela and her brother behind. Lucy would have given the world to have reversed the order, but the man took his place by her side, and he wouldn\u0027t go away until he left her at the gate of Newnham. \u0027You have met me before, Miss Rae, as well as Gwatkin,\u0027 he said, as he walked by Lucy\u0027s side. \u0027I believe he invited you in to see the spectacle.\u0027 \u0027He didn\u0027t invite me in at all,\u0027 Lucy said[Pg 178] hotly; \u0027I came in. You were very ill when I saw you; I did not expect you would get well so soon.\u0027 \u0027No?\u0027 he said indifferently, \u0027I suppose not. It did not much matter either way.\u0027 \u0027It mattered a great deal!\u0027 she said sharply. She was very angry with him for speaking in that absurd way—absurd and ungrateful—considering what a trouble he had been to his friends. \u0027It mattered a great deal to Mr. Gwatkin. Oh, you don\u0027t know how anxious he was about you! He saved your life.\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said in his slow, indifferent way, flicking with his cane at the nettles in the hedge; \u0027I believe he did. It was rather a pity he should have taken so much trouble, but I suppose he liked it. I believe he didn\u0027t get off his knees all one night. He\u0027s always glad of an excuse for getting on his knees.\u0027 And then he laughed. It was such a delightful laugh that it ought to have been infectious, but Lucy looked grave. [Pg 179] \u0027I suppose he was on his knees when you came in?\u0027 he said. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Lucy shortly, but she didn\u0027t tell him that she had knelt down beside Eric and prayed that the life he valued so little might be spared. She was very angry with him; she could only trust herself to say \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Oh, he is a good fellow is Wattles, but he has his little crazes.\u0027 \u0027He is a splendid fellow!\u0027 said Lucy warmly. She was ashamed of her warmth the moment after she had said it, but they had reached the gate of Newnham by this time, and she was glad to say \u0027Good-bye\u0027 and run away. She left him standing at the gate waiting for the others to come up, while quite a dozen girls on the lawn were looking at him and admiring him, and making up all sorts of fine stories in their heads about him. If they had only known what Lucy knew about him they would have made up a great deal more. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2909/80078.html","bookId":1099,"book":{"id":1099,"title":"The master of St. Benedict\u0027s","description":"简介： The success and the distinction had come early in life, and the love had come late.
