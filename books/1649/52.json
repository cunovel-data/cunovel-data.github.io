Gathering everything I have, everything I am, I focus on the door in the far horizon, the door that isn’t a door—that beckons yet I dare not answer—and the tethers holding me to my body give way. I sail out of the cockpit and into the crimson sea; it blazes through me, but there is no pain. Instead of letting the current carry me all the way out, I leap to the beacon and pass through it in my entirety. Everything changes.

But the red current pulls at me, tugging me toward my final exit. And I’m swimming against the tide.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killbox-sirantha-jax-4/page-52.html","bookId":1649,"book":{"id":1649,"title":"Killbox (Sirantha Jax #4)","description":"Storyline: Killbox (Sirantha Jax #4) Talk is cheap when lives are in jeopardy Sirantha Jax is a “Jumper,” a woman who possesses the unique genetic makeup needed to navigate faster than light ships through grimspace.
