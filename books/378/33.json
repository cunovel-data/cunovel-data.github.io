{"id":23964,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. DICK PUNISHES NICHOLAS.","content":"\"Is that man going to stay here?\" asked Nicholas, in a tone of dissatisfaction. \"Yes.\" \"What made you invite him?\" \"I couldn\u0027t help it, Nicholas. He is my brother.\" \"I\u0027m ashamed of the relationship.\" \"I am not proud of it myself, but I can\u0027t help paying him a little attention.\" \"How long is he going to stay?\" \"A day or two.\" \"He\u0027ll stay a week or two if you let him.\" \"I can prevent that.\" \"How?\" \"You\u0027ll see.\" The manner of Nicholas toward his uncle was far from agreeable. In fact, it was almost insolent. Dick retained his temper out of policy, but he said to himself: \"Some time or other, my fine nephew, I\u0027ll pay off old scores. See if I don\u0027t.\" \"Are you going to ride this morning?\" he asked the next day. \"I may,\" answered Nicholas. \"I should like to ride with you.\" \"I prefer riding by myself.\" \"Oh, come, nephew. I shan\u0027t stay here long. Don\u0027t refuse such a small favor.\" In consequence probably of the first part of this answer, Mrs. Kent said: \"Nicholas, you\u0027d better take your uncle out this morning and show him a little of the village.\" Nicholas grumblingly assented. So about ten o\u0027clock they started out. \"You\u0027ve got a good horse here,\" said Dick. \"He ought to be. Mother paid four hundred dollars for him.\" \"Did she, though? You ought to have got me to send you one from the West. For half the money I\u0027d have sent you a better one.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it.\" \"Because you don\u0027t know. I do.\" \"It takes a good driver to drive this horse,\" said Nicholas. \"Does it? I could drive this horse blindfolded.\" He spoke contemptuously, and Nicholas was nettled. He prided himself upon his driving ability, and now his uncle underestimated it. \"The horse is not as easy to drive as you think,\" he said. \"If you don\u0027t believe it, take the reins and see.\" \"All right.\" This was what Dick wanted, for he had a plan for revenging himself on his upstart nephew. He drove on till he got to a place where there was a muddy and miry puddle beside the road. Then by a dexterous man?uver, for he understood driving thoroughly, he managed to overturn the wagon, and Nicholas was thrown headlong into the puddle. Dick leaped out just at the right time, retaining his hold on the reins. Bespattered with mud and drenched with mire, Nicholas arose from the puddle a sorry figure. \"What did you do that for?\" he demanded, wrathfully, surveying himself with disgust. \"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t manage your horse,\" said Dick, with hypocritical meekness. \"He was too much for me.\" \"Didn\u0027t I tell you so?\" said Nicholas, triumphing in spite of his woful condition. \"I\u0027m sorry you fell into the puddle. Why didn\u0027t you jump, as I did?\" \"I didn\u0027t have time,\" said Nicholas, ruefully. \"What a figure I am!\" \"I suppose we may as well go home.\" \"Yes,\" said Nicholas, sullenly. \"That comes of giving you the reins.\" \"You are right,\" said Dick. \"You\u0027d better drive home yourself.\" Nicholas took the reins, but it mortified him not a little to see the looks of wonder and amusement which he attracted as he passed through the village. Dick laughed to himself. \"I rather think, my proud nephew, we\u0027re about even,\" he said to himself. In the course of the next day Dick ventured to suggest to his sister that a temporary loan would be very acceptable. \"A loan!\" she repeated, curling her lip. \"Why not say \u0027gift\u0027 at once?\" \"I\u0027m willing to put it on that ground,\" said Dick, unabashed. \"Still, I\u0027ll give you my note for the amount, if you say so.\" \"What good would that do?\" \"Why, I\u0027ve got some plans in view which, if successful, will enable me to repay you the money, with interest.\" \"I have small faith in the success of your plans, Richard.\" \"I haven\u0027t been as lucky as you, sister Helen, I admit; but where would you have been but for your lucky marriage?\" \"As to that, I have always taken care of myself,\" said his sister, coldly. \"May be so. There are some born to good luck.\" \"How much money do you expect me to give you?\" asked Mrs. Kent. Dick looked at his sister\u0027s face attentively. He wished to judge how much there was a chance of getting out of her. His survey was not particularly encouraging. She didn\u0027t appear to be a woman easily wheedled out of her money. Still, he spoke up boldly, and said: \"A loan of five hundred dollars, Helen, would be a great lift to me.\" \"I have no doubt it would,\" said Mrs. Kent, quietly; \"but if you have any expectation of getting that sum from me you know very little of me. I should be a fool to throw away such a sum of money.\" \"You would be generous.\" \"I have no ambition to be considered generous,\" she answered, coldly. \"A fool and his money are soon parted. You appear to take me for a fool, but I beg to assure you that you are entirely mistaken.\" \"How much will you lend me, then?\" asked Dick, rather sullenly. \"Don\u0027t use that ridiculous word \u0027lend,\u0027 when you know there\u0027s no probability of your ever repaying it, even if you should be able.\" \"Have your own way, Helen.\" \"I will give you fifty dollars, though in justice to my boy I ought not to do so.\" \"Fifty dollars!\" repeated Dick, chagrined. \"Why, that don\u0027t pay me for coming East.\" \"You are right. You would have done better to stay where you were.\" \"You don\u0027t seem to consider, Helen, that we hadn\u0027t met for years, and I wanted to see my only sister.\" \"Suppose I had had no money, would you have come then?\" asked Mrs. Kent, with contemptuous incredulity. \"No; I couldn\u0027t have afforded it. But, Helen, fifty dollars is nothing at all. You might say a hundred.\" \"I might say a hundred, but there is no chance that I shall. Are you not ashamed—a great, strong man, as you are—not to be able to support yourself and wife without help from me?\" \"Luck\u0027s been agin me,\" said Dick, sullenly. \"I could have got ahead but for that.\" \"How has it been against you?\" \"I owned a mining claim in California—it didn\u0027t pay anything—and I sold it for ten dollars. The man I sold it to kept working till he struck a vein. He cleared ten thousand dollars.\" \"As you might have done if you hadn\u0027t despaired too quickly.\" \"Oh, well, it\u0027s easy enough to criticise, Helen. You\u0027ve struck a vein, and you\u0027re in luck. No more hard work for you.\" \"There would be if I gave away my money, five hundred dollars at a time. You needn\u0027t complain of my good fortune. I have had my share of work to do. Now I am comfortable, and I mean to keep so.\" \"No matter what becomes of your poor brother?\" whined Dick. \"My poor brother must work as I have done, and he won\u0027t starve. Do you think, if I were a man,\" she said, disdainfully, \"that I would stoop to ask help of a woman!\" \"Well, let me have the money, then,\" said Dick, gloomily. Mrs. Kent drew from her pocket-book five ten-dollar bills and placed them in his hand. \"Don\u0027t expect any further help,\" she said. \"In justice to my son I must refuse it.\" Dick left the house with an execration. \"Was there ever a more selfish, cold-hearted woman?\" he muttered. \"It\u0027s all for her son, is it? I\u0027d like to choke the whelp!\" With this sentiment the affectionate uncle left his sister\u0027s house. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2967/81696.html","bookId":378,"book":{"id":378,"title":"Frank and Fearless or The Fortunes of Jasper Kent","description":"简介： A dozen boys were playing ball in a field adjoining the boarding-school of Dr. Pericles Benton, in the town of Walltham, a hundred and twenty-five miles northeast of the city of New York.
