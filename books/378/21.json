JASPER IS INTRUSTED WITH A DELICATE COMMISSION.","content":"\"Look here, boy,\" said Dick, \"do you want a job?\" \"Yes,\" said Jasper, \"if it\u0027s honest.\" \"No fear of that. I want you to take that boy home to his father.\" \"I\u0027ll do it,\" said Jasper, eagerly. \"How much pay do you want?\" \"None at all, except money to pay my fare in the cars.\" \"You\u0027re the right sort,\" said Dick, with satisfaction. \"But there\u0027s another matter I\u0027ve got to think about. How do I know but you will betray me?\" \"How?\" \"Put the police on my track.\" \"If you hadn\u0027t given up the boy I might,\" said Jasper, frankly. Dick regarded him attentively. \"You\u0027re bold,\" he said. \"Then you won\u0027t betray me now.\" \"No.\" \"Promise it.\" \"I promise—that is, if you send the boy home by me.\" \"All right; that\u0027s understood. Now for another matter. Read that letter.\" Jasper read the letter of Herman Fitch, already quoted. \"You see this man, the boy\u0027s father, agrees to pay one hundred and fifty dollars when he is given up.\" \"I see that.\" \"He will give you that money—that is, if he means fair—and you will bring it to me. Do you understand?\" \"I do.\" \"Do you promise that?\" \"I promise that, too. Where am I to find you? Here?\" \"No; I\u0027ll give you an address in St. Louis.\" \"Does the father live in St. Louis?\" \"He lives a little out of the city. His name is in the directory, so you won\u0027t have any trouble in finding it.\" \"How glad he will be to see the little boy again!\" \"He ought to be. You don\u0027t think he\u0027ll back out from his agreement?\" said Dick, suspiciously. \"No; he\u0027ll be so glad to see the child, he will care nothing for the money.\" \"That\u0027s what I hope. When I get that money I\u0027m going East.\" \"You\u0027ll take me with you, Dick?\" asked his wife. \"What good\u0027ll you be?\" growled Dick. \"It\u0027ll cost more.\" \"What can I do alone, here?\" \"I\u0027ll leave money for your board.\" \"But I\u0027ll be so lonely, Dick,\" she persisted. \"Oh, I\u0027ll come back! It\u0027s business I\u0027m going for, old woman. If I can\u0027t come back I\u0027ll send money to bring you.\" \"Do let me go with you, Dick.\" \"Oh, hush up! I can\u0027t have you always in my way. What, blubbering? Plague take all the women, I say!\" \"When do you want me to go?\" said Jasper. \"There\u0027s a train this afternoon; take that, for the sooner matters are arranged the better. Here\u0027s five dollars. It\u0027ll be more than enough to pay your fare, but you\u0027d better have it in case anything happens.\" Jasper felt some repugnance in taking money acquired in such a way, but it seemed necessary, and he thrust the note into his vest-pocket. \"You\u0027ll be able to carry the boy back to-night,\" said Dick. \"To-morrow at twelve bring the money to this address.\" He handed him a greasy-looking card with the name \"Mark Mortimer, No. 132 S—— Street,\" scrawled on it in pencil. \"Am I to ask for Mark Mortimer?\" asked Jasper. \"Yes, that\u0027s me—that is, it\u0027s one of my names. Don\u0027t fail.\" \"I won\u0027t.\" \"If you should play me false, you\u0027d better never have been born,\" said the kidnapper, menacingly. \"I\u0027ll come, not on account of your threats, but because I have promised,\" said Jasper, quietly. \"You\u0027re a plucky boy. You ain\u0027t one of the milk-and-water sort,\" said Dick, with respect for the boy\u0027s courage. \"Thank you,\" said Jasper, laughing. \"I am not often afraid.\" \"By Jove! you\u0027ve got more pluck than half the men. You\u0027d make a fine lad for my business.\" \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027d like your business, so far as I know what it is,\" said Jasper. \"Well, there\u0027s some I\u0027d like better myself. If my sister does the right thing by me I\u0027ll become a model citizen—run for Congress, may be. Eh, old woman?\" \"I wish you would reform, Dick,\" said his wife. \"Let the world give me a chance, then. Now, boy, you must be starting.\" \"Harry,\" said Jasper to the little boy, whose name he had learned, \"do you want to go with me?\" The little boy confidingly put his arms round our hero\u0027s neck. \"Will you take me to my mamma?\" he asked. \"Yes, I will take you to her.\" The little boy uttered a cry of delight. \"Me all ready!\" he said, eagerly. \"Do you think he can walk to the depot?\" asked Jasper. \"Yes; it is only a mile or so.\" \"Then I will start.\" Part of the way he carried the little boy in his arms. They could make but slow progress, but luckily there was plenty of time, and they reached the depot a quarter of an hour before the train started. The station-master looked at the two with curiosity. \"Is that boy yours?\" \"He isn\u0027t my son, if that\u0027s what you mean,\" said Jasper, amused. \"Brother, then?\" \"No; he\u0027s a friend of mine that I\u0027m taking home to his father and mother.\" \"Been makin\u0027 a visit around here?\" asked the station-master. \"Yes,\" replied Jasper, briefly. The arrival of two passengers, who wanted tickets, relieved him from the questions of the curious station-master. He might have asked questions which it would have been inconvenient to answer. \"Did you ever ride in the cars, Harry?\" asked Jasper. \"I did ride in the cars when the ugly man took me from my mamma.\" \"Was that the only time?\" The little boy could remember no other. Jasper led him a little away, to avoid questioning, but was back in time to enter the cars when the train arrived. He found a vacant seat, and gave the little boy the place next the window. There were many admiring glances directed toward the little fellow, who was remarkably handsome. Jasper was apprehensive lest the boy should be recognized by some one who knew him. This would have brought suspicion upon him, and placed him in a very embarrassing position. Fortunately, though the child\u0027s appearance was much admired, no such recognition took place. Two hours later they rolled into the central depot at St. Louis. \"Now,\" thought Jasper, \"I must find out as soon as possible where Mr. Fitch lives.\" Jasper had not been much of a traveller, as we know. Finding himself now in a strange city, he felt at first a little bewildered—the more so, that he had a young child under his charge. He did not know in which direction the boy\u0027s father lived, but the natural thought occurred to him that he could find his name in the directory. He went into a lager-beer saloon near-by and asked: \"Will you let me see your directory?\" \"I got no directory,\" answered the burly Dutchman, who presided over the saloon. \"I can give you lager.\" \"Not at present,\" said Jasper, laughing. \"We don\u0027t drink.\" It occurred to him that it might be as well to get into the central part of the city. He accordingly hailed a passing car, and got aboard with Harry. After awhile he judged from the appearance of the buildings that he had reached one of the principal streets. He descended from the car, lifting Harry carefully down and carrying him in his arms to the sidewalk. There was a large and imposing store situated at the corner of the street. \"They must have a directory in there,\" thought Jasper. He entered, holding the little boy by the hand. What was his surprise when a richly-dressed lady, turning and catching sight of the child, sprang to him, seized him in her arms, and began to cry and laugh alternately. But the mystery was explained when he heard Harry say: \"Oh, mamma, I am so glad to see you!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2967/81684.html","bookId":378,"book":{"id":378,"title":"Frank and Fearless or The Fortunes of Jasper Kent","description":"简介： A dozen boys were playing ball in a field adjoining the boarding-school of Dr. Pericles Benton, in the town of Walltham, a hundred and twenty-five miles northeast of the city of New York.
