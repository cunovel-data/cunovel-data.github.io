{"id":23939,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. SUDDEN DEATH.","content":"Two months later there was a vacation for a week. Nicholas expected to spend this with his mother, but for some reason Mrs. Kent gave him no invitation. Probably she thought that Nicholas, though a paragon in her eyes, was not likely to win favor in the eyes of Mr. Kent. His rough, brutal disposition would have repelled the sick man, who had become gentle in his enforced seclusion. Thorne was disappointed, but his disappointment was softened by a timely remittance of ten dollars from his mother, which he spent partly in surreptitious games of billiards, partly in overloading his stomach with pastry and nearly making himself sick. Jasper spent the week at home. His company was the source of great comfort and joy to his father, and this repaid him for the intrusion of his step-mother. She treated him with politeness and apparent cordiality, but once or twice, when he chanced to look up unexpectedly, he detected her eyes fixed upon him with a glance that seemed to express detestation. On these occasions her expression changed instantly, and she addressed him in a soft, friendly voice. All this puzzled him. \"Does she hate me or not?\" he asked himself. \"I certainly don\u0027t like her. Still, I shall force myself to treat her politely as long as she treats my father well.\" His father seldom spoke of his wife to his son, but sometimes Jasper noticed that he breathed a sigh of relief when she left the room, as if her presence had been a restraint upon him. He didn\u0027t like to ask his father any question directly as to the relations between them. He hoped that at least they did not add to his father\u0027s discomfort. At the end of the week Jasper was about to return to school. \"How long before you have another vacation, Jasper?\" asked his father, wistfully. \"Eleven weeks, father.\" \"It seems a long time, Jasper.\" \"I can come home during that time.\" \"To my mind such interruptions of study are bad for a boy,\" said Mrs. Kent. \"Perhaps they are,\" assented Mr. Kent, reluctantly. \"I won\u0027t let them be an interruption, father,\" said Jasper. \"If you want me to come home, I will.\" \"I hope, Jasper, you will understand my motive for speaking,\" said Mrs. Kent, softly. \"I should really be glad to see you, but sometimes we have to sacrifice our own inclinations—don\u0027t we, Mr. Kent?\" \"Yes, my dear,\" said Mr. Kent, listlessly. And he turned his eyes once more to Jasper, who had his overcoat on and was waiting for the carriage to convey him to the depot. \"Do you feel as well as usual, father?\" asked Jasper, anxiously. \"Yes, I don\u0027t know but I do; perhaps a little more languid, but that is not unusual.\" \"Well, good-bye, father. If you want to see me at any time, write a line, and I\u0027ll come at once.\" \"Thank you, my dear boy. Don\u0027t overwork yourself at school.\" There was a slight smile on Mrs. Kent\u0027s thin lips. Jasper noticed and mentally resented it. But the time had come for leave-taking, and he hurried away. Six weeks passed. Jasper heard from home that his father was about the same, and this assurance relieved him of anxiety. Still, he made up his mind that he would spend the next Sunday at home. He would go on Saturday morning and come back on Monday morning, and he knew that his father would enjoy even this brief visit. But he was destined to go home quicker. On Thursday afternoon a boy came up to the main entrance of Dr. Benton\u0027s school. \"It\u0027s the boy from the telegraph office,\" said Wilder to Jasper. \"I wonder whether he\u0027s got a message for the doctor or one of us boys?\" said Jasper, not suspecting that it was for himself. \"I\u0027ll ask,\" said Wilder. \"Here, you, boy! who\u0027s your telegram for?\" \"For Jasper Kent,\" said the boy. \"Will you call him?\" \"I am he,\" said Jasper, hurrying forward, with pale face and beating heart, for a telegram always inspires fear. \"Then here it is. Just sign the book,\" said the boy. Jasper scrawled his name hurriedly and tore open the envelope. These were the brief words of the dispatch: \"Come home, for the Lord\u0027s sake, Master Jasper. Your father\u0027s dying. \"Margaret Bower.\" The paper swam before Jasper\u0027s eyes. \"What is it, Jasper—bad news?\" asked Wilder; but Jasper did not wait to answer. He rushed to Dr. Benton\u0027s office, got his permission to go home, packed his valise, and in five minutes was on his way to the depot. He was just in time for the afternoon train. At seven o\u0027clock in the evening he entered the avenue that led to his father\u0027s house. Throwing open the front door, he met Margaret in the hall. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here, Master Jasper,\" said the faithful handmaiden, heartily. \"Is it too late?\" \"I hope not; indeed, I hope not.\" Jasper waited for no more, but rushed up stairs and into his father\u0027s room. There were two persons there—the step-mother and a man of thirty, with black whiskers and sallow complexion, with whom she was talking earnestly. They, started when Jasper entered, and looked discouraged. Mrs. Kent looked displeased and annoyed. \"How is my father?\" exclaimed Jasper, excitedly. \"Hush! He is very low,\" said Mrs. Kent \"You shouldn\u0027t have dashed in here so abruptly.\" \"Is there no hope for him?\" asked the boy, sorrowfully. \"No, my young friend,\" said the man, smoothly. \"All has been done that human skill can do, but without avail.\" \"Are you the doctor?\" \"I am.\" \"Where is Dr. Graham, my father\u0027s old doctor?\" \"I dismissed him,\" said his step-mother, \"He was not competent to attend so critical a case. This is Dr. Kenyon.\" \"I never before heard Dr. Graham\u0027s skill doubted,\" said Jasper. \"Is my father conscious?\" \"No; he is under the influence of morphine. Do not wake him up.\" \"Was he, then, in great pain?\" \"Yes, in great pain.\" Quietly Jasper drew near the bedside. His father lay unconscious, his form rigid, his face thin and betraying marks of weariness and suffering. The tears rose to the eyes of Jasper as he realized that his father was passing away. As he looked on there was a slight convulsive movement; then repose. In that one moment his father had passed on to another world. The doctor had approached the bedside also, and he, too, saw the movement. \"He is dead!\" he announced. \"Dead!\" repeated Mrs. Kent, in a voice rather of surprise than of sorrow. \"Yes.\" \"Well,\" she said, coolly, \"we must all die. We have the satisfaction of knowing that we have done all we could do to preserve his life.\" \"Certainly, my dear madam; you may comfort yourself by that thought,\" said the physician. \"Why did you not send for me before?\" asked Jasper, turning with moist eyes to his step-mother, \"that I might see my father before he died?\" \"We could not foresee his sudden death,\" said Mrs. Kent. \"How do you happen to be here this afternoon?\" \"Didn\u0027t you direct Margaret to telegraph for me?\" asked Jasper, surprised. \"Did Margaret take upon herself to telegraph to you?\" asked Mrs. Kent, in a tone of displeasure. \"Yes,\" said Jasper, bitterly. \"Did you mean to keep me wholly unacquainted with my father\u0027s illness?\" \"No; I wrote a line this afternoon, which I should have sent to the office at once.\" \"When it was too late!\" \"Your reproaches are unseemly and uncalled for,\" said his step-mother, quite coldly. \"I think differently,\" said Jasper, bitterly. \"You should have sent for me as soon as my father got worse than usual.\" \"In consideration of your grief I will overlook your impertinence,\" said Mrs. Kent, compressing her thin lips, as she left the room. The doctor followed her out, and Jasper was left alone with the dead. He did not realize it, but his father\u0027s death was to seriously affect his fortunes. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2967/81671.html","bookId":378,"book":{"id":378,"title":"Frank and Fearless or The Fortunes of Jasper Kent","description":"简介： A dozen boys were playing ball in a field adjoining the boarding-school of Dr. Pericles Benton, in the town of Walltham, a hundred and twenty-five miles northeast of the city of New York.
