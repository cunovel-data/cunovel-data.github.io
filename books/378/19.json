{"id":23950,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. A BRUTE IN HUMAN SHAPE.","content":"Jasper could not help feeling that he was in rather a critical position. A man whose business it was to kidnap young children in order to extort money from their friends was not likely to be very scrupulous, and the fear of having his secret divulged might lead him to extreme measures. \"Is your husband likely to come up here?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t know; he may,\" answered the woman, anxiously. \"Can\u0027t you hide me?\" suggested Jasper. \"Yes, yes,\" she said, recovering something of her presence of mind. \"There, get into that closet. I\u0027ll come and let you out when he is gone.\" She opened the door of a closet in one corner of the room. It was quite dark inside, and except a stool, it was entirely empty. \"Sit down there,\" said the woman. \"I must go down now.\" She buttoned the door, and our hero found himself a close prisoner in the dark. It certainly gave him a peculiar sensation. Only a week before he had been at his Eastern home. Now he was more than a thousand miles away, penniless, and a prisoner. But though he was peculiarly situated, he was not discouraged. In fact, with a brave boy\u0027s love of adventure, he felt a certain exhilaration and wondered what was coming next. His courage and enterprise rose with the occasion, and he began to consider what course he should take after he got out. While he is sitting in the closet in dark captivity, we will go below and make acquaintance with the man whose arrival had produced so great a sensation. Before going down, the woman said to the child: \"Don\u0027t tell anybody about the boy in the closet.\" \"No, I won\u0027t,\" said the child, obediently. The woman hurried down stairs, but her husband was already waiting for her. He was a black-browed ruffian, with a rough beard of a week\u0027s growth. He threw himself sullenly into a chair and growled: \"Where were you? You\u0027re always out of the way when I come home.\" \"I just went up stairs a minute, Dick,\" she answered. \"To see the brat, I suppose.\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027ve a great mind to knock him on the head.\" \"Oh, Dick, you wouldn\u0027t injure the little innocent,\" she said, earnestly. \"Wouldn\u0027t I? I would if I was paid enough, but there\u0027s nothing to be made by killing him.\" \"Thank heaven!\" uttered the woman, fervently. \"You haven\u0027t got the heart of a chicken!\" said the man, contemptuously. \"Give me something to eat. I\u0027m hungry.\" The woman began to bustle around in obedience to his command. \"I haven\u0027t got much in the house, Dick,\" she said, apologetically. \"What have you got?\" he growled. \"Some eggs and a little bacon. Shall I make you some tea?\" \"No; bring out the whisky.\" \"There\u0027s none left, Dick.\" The man uttered an oath expressive of disappointment. \"Well, give me some slops, then,\" he said. \"I must have something to drink.\" \"Didn\u0027t you shoot anything?\" she ventured to ask. \"I haven\u0027t been hunting.\" \"I thought you took out your gun.\" \"What if I did? I don\u0027t always hunt when I take my gun. I expected to hear from the friends of that brat this morning, but I didn\u0027t. They must hurry up with their money if they don\u0027t want me to strangle him.\" \"Perhaps they didn\u0027t get your letter, Dick.\" \"Yes, they did. I took care of that. I s\u0027pose they\u0027re hatching up some plot to have me arrested. If they do, it\u0027ll be a bad day for the brat.\" He looked fierce and brutal enough to execute the dark threat at which he indirectly hinted. There was a cruel look in his eye which showed that he would have had small scruples about injuring an innocent child, if provoked by the desire for revenge. While his wife was cooking the eggs he filled his pipe and began to smoke. She made all the haste she could, knowing that her husband was far from patient. Soon the frugal repast was ready. She set it on the table, and said: \"It\u0027s all ready, Dick. Better eat it while it\u0027s hot.\" \"I\u0027ll eat it when I choose,\" he growled, in his usual spirit of contradiction. However, he was hungry, and laying aside his pipe, did as she requested. Soon he had dispatched all the food set before him. \"There isn\u0027t enough to keep a kitten from starving,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorry, Dick.\" \"Much you are sorry,\" he growled. \"A pretty wife you are.\" \"I wish there were more. If you\u0027ll give me some money I\u0027ll go out and buy something.\" \"Money!\" he snarled. \"You\u0027re always wanting money. Do you think I am made of money?\" \"No, Dick; but you know I have none. I wish I knew of any way to earn it.\" \"You do?\" \"Yes, Dick.\" \"Then I suppose you\u0027d be leaving me,\" he said, suspiciously. \"No, I wouldn\u0027t. You know I wouldn\u0027t, Dick.\" \"So you say,\" he answered, brutally, \"How\u0027s the brat? Has it been crying?\" \"No; it is a very good child.\" \"I\u0027ll go up and take a look at it.\" He arose from his seat, and advanced toward the door. His wife followed him. \"Where are you going?\" he asked, turning upon her. \"I\u0027m going up, too,\" she answered, meekly. \"What for? Can\u0027t you trust me with the brat?\" \"Yes, Dick, but it isn\u0027t much used to you. You might frighten it, and make it cry.\" \"That\u0027s all right,\" he answered, smiling grimly. \"I like to hear children cry.\" \"How can you enjoy the sufferings of a child?\" \"Halloo! What\u0027s that?\" he said, looking sharply at her. \"You dare to find fault with me, do you?\" \"I didn\u0027t mean that, Dick,\" she said, submissively. \"It\u0027s lucky you didn\u0027t,\" he said, warningly. \"I don\u0027t allow none of that, wife or no wife.\" \"May I go up?\" \"If you want to.\" So the two went up stairs together. The wife was nervous lest the child in some way might excite the suspicions of her husband and betray the presence of Jasper. She felt, therefore, very ill at ease. The child was sitting up in bed. \"Halloo, young \u0027un, how yer gettin\u0027 along?\" asked the man, roughly. The child did not answer, but looked frightened. \"Why don\u0027t you answer?\" demanded the man, frowning. The child looked toward the woman, and seemed on the point of crying. \"Can\u0027t you say something to the gentleman?\" said the woman, soothingly. Thus adjured, the little boy said: \"Won\u0027t you take me to my mamma?\" \"Oh, yes, I\u0027ll take you as soon as your mamma sends me some money,\" said the man named Dick, \"and she\u0027d better do it pretty soon, too,\" he muttered. He threw himself into a chair, and ceased to notice the child. \"Do you know, old woman,\" he said in a different tone, \"I\u0027ve heard news that\u0027ll rather take you by suprise?\" \"I hope it is good news,\" said his wife, anxiously. \"Well, that\u0027s as may be,\" he answered. \"It ought to be good news for us, but there\u0027s no saying. You know my sister?\" \"Mrs. Thorne?\" \"Yes. Well, she\u0027s had a stroke of luck.\" \"How was that?\" \"Well, you see she went as governess into a family. The man was rich and an invalidâ€”a widower, too. What does she do but get him to marry her?\" \"She has been fortunate.\" \"That isn\u0027t all of it. She hadn\u0027t been married but two or three months when her husband died, leaving her a third of his property and guardian to his son, who inherits the rest. So she\u0027s a rich woman. I say she ought to do something for her brother Dick. Don\u0027t you say so?\" \"I think she would be willing,\" said the wife. \"She ought to be, but she\u0027s selfish. She always was. If only I had the money I\u0027d go East, and see what I could get out of her.\" \"You\u0027d take me with you, Dick?\" \"No, I wouldn\u0027t. It\u0027ll be all I can do to raise money enough to pay my own expenses, let alone yours. If I get anything I\u0027ll come back, and you\u0027ll get your share. That\u0027s why I want the parents of that brat to fork over the cash pretty quick.\" \"How did you learn the news about your sister, Dick?\" \"An old pal of mine has just come from that way and told me all about it.\" Every word of this dialogue was beard by Jasper in his place of concealment. He was astonished beyond measure to learn that this ruffian was the brother of his step-mother. \"No wonder I don\u0027t like her,\" he thought, \"if they have any traits in common. What a fate, for my kind and gentle father to marry the sister of such a man!\" \"I\u0027m glad of it,\" said his wife. \"Well, so am I, if she\u0027ll do the right thing by me; but if she don\u0027t, then I\u0027m sorry.\" \"What shall I do when you\u0027re away, Dick?\" \"Get along as well as you can. Folks\u0027ll give you victuals, if you get hard up.\" \"I don\u0027t like to beg.\" \"Wish me good luck, then, and money enough to take care of you. What are you starin\u0027 at, young \u0027un?\" This he said to the child, whose eyes, as if by a species of fascination, were fixed upon him. \"Take me home to mamma!\" pleaded the child, beginning to cry. \"Shut up!\" said the ruffian, harshly, striding to the bed and pinching the boy\u0027s arm till he cried with the pain. \"Oh, don\u0027t, Dick,\" pleaded the woman, who was fond of children, though she had never been a mother. \"I\u0027ll give the brat something to cry for,\" said her husband, and he pinched him again. \"Oh, Dick, how can you torture the poor child?\" said his wife, braver in the little boy\u0027s defence than in her own. \"What business has it to cry, then? I\u0027d like to choke it. If you don\u0027t hush I\u0027ll serve you the same way.\" Jasper had listened to this brutality as long as he could, but his indignation became too hot to be repressed. Thoughtless of consequences, he burst open the closet door and strode into the presence of the astonished ruffian, his fists involuntarily clenched, and his eyes kindling with indignation.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2967/81682.html","bookId":378,"book":{"id":378,"title":"Frank and Fearless or The Fortunes of Jasper Kent","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š A dozen boys were playing ball in a field adjoining the boarding-school of Dr. Pericles Benton, in the town of Walltham, a hundred and twenty-five miles northeast of the city of New York.
