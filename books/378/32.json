{"id":23963,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII. A COLD RECEPTION.","content":"Richard Varley followed Nicholas into the presence of Mrs. Kent. The latter looked scrutinizingly at him as he approached, hoping that it might be an impostor. But, no! there was no mistaking his appearance. It was, indeed, her brother. \"How d\u0027ye do, Helen,\" said Dick, with ostentatious cordiality. \"Very well, Richard,\" she answered coldly, slipping her hand out of his grasp as quickly as she could. \"The old girl ain\u0027t very glad to see me,\" thought Dick. \"Just as I thought.\" \"How did you find me out?\" asked Mrs. Kent. \"There was a man from this way told me of your good luck.\" \"Where were you, then?\" \"In Missouri, near St. Louis.\" \"Indeed? Have you just come from there?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did you have any business this way? I suppose you must, or you wouldn\u0027t have come so far.\" \"I came on purpose to see you, Helen,\" said Dick, trying to look like an affectionate brother, and signally failing. \"You are certainly very kind,\" said Mrs. Kent in a cold tone, evincing not the slightest pleasure at his devotion. \"I am afraid you must have put yourself to a good deal of inconvenience on my account.\" \"Why, yes, I have,\" answered her brother, perceiving at once that he might urge this as a claim upon her; \"but what of that? Ain\u0027t you my only sister, and hasn\u0027t it been years since we met?\" \"Really, Richard,\" said Mrs. Kent, with a little quiet sarcasm, \"I was hardly prepared to expect from you so great an interest in me. I wonder you didn\u0027t come before. It\u0027s a good many years since we met.\" \"Well, Helen, you see I couldn\u0027t afford it before. I wanted to see you, but I couldn\u0027t raise the money to come East.\" \"You\u0027ve raised it now, it seems.\" \"Yes; I had a little stroke of luck.\" \"You\u0027re doing well, then?\" asked his sister, with a slight show of interest. If this were so, she was ready to welcome him. \"I said a little show of luck. I got together money enough to come East.\" \"Oh, indeed!\" returned Mrs. Kent, her manner becoming chilly again. Dick got nettled. He didn\u0027t relish his reception. \"It seems to me you ain\u0027t very glad to see me,\" said he, bluntly. \"I never was very demonstrative,\" said his sister. \"Did you expect me to fall on your neck and embrace you?\" \"No; but—well, you know what I mean. You are as cold as an icicle.\" \"It\u0027s my way, I suppose. Is your wife living?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is she with you?\" asked Mrs. Kent, rather apprehensively. \"No; it was too expensive for me to bring two. I hear you are rich, Helen.\" \"Is that what brought you on?\" \"Don\u0027t be so suspicious. It\u0027s only natural I should congratulate you.\" Before this Nicholas had left the room to go out on his proposed drive. \"I\u0027ve got enough to live on economically,\" she answered, with reserve. \"I am not rich.\" \"Your son, Nicholas, acts as if you were.\" \"How is that?\" Dick laughed. \"He puts on as many heirs as a prince.\" \"He has considerable spirit,\" said Mrs. Kent, proudly. \"There\u0027s no doubt of that. He ordered me off with the air of a young lord.\" \"That was before he knew who you were.\" \"Yes, he didn\u0027t know I was his uncle. By the way, you\u0027ve got a step-son, haven\u0027t you?\" \"Yes; two-thirds of this property belongs to him.\" \"Where is he?\" \"He is absent just now,\" answered Mrs. Kent, in a tone of reserve. Dick laughed. \"Oh, you\u0027re good at keeping secrets, Helen,\" he said; \"but you can\u0027t deceive me.\" \"What do you mean?\" inquired his sister, with some indignation. \"I know all about his going away, Helen.\" \"Who told you—the neighbors? Have you been questioning them about my affairs?\" \"No, no. You\u0027re on the wrong scent this time. He told me himself.\" \"What! has he got back again?\" demanded Mrs. Kent, in surprise and dismay. \"No; I met him in Missouri. He told me there.\" \"How did he know you were related to me?\" \"He heard me and my wife talking about you, and then he told me.\" \"What did he tell you?\" \"That you and he couldn\u0027t agree, and so he left home.\" \"He was insubordinate. He disobeyed me, and I wouldn\u0027t stand it.\" \"Oh, well, you two can settle your own affairs. I don\u0027t care to interfere, only I thought you would like to hear from him.\" \"What\u0027s he doing?\" asked Mrs. Kent. \"He was in St. Louis when I left, looking out for a situation.\" \"I wash my hands of him. He might live easily enough if he would submit to me. If not, he will probably have to submit to a great many privations.\" \"He is a pretty smart boy; he\u0027ll get along.\" \"I consider my Nicholas smarter,\" said Mrs. Kent, coldly. \"Perhaps so,\" answered her brother, dubiously. \"I don\u0027t know much about Nicholas.\" \"Where are you staying?\" asked his sister. \"Why,\" said Dick, rather taken aback, \"I calculated you would invite me to stay here awhile, seeing I\u0027ve come so far to see you.\" Mrs. Kent bit her lips in vexation. \"You can stay a day or two, if you like,\" she said, \"but we live very quietly, Nicholas and I. I don\u0027t think it will suit one so active as you are.\" \"I\u0027ll take the risk, sister Helen. It seems good to be in my own sister\u0027s house after so many years. Besides, I should like to ride out with my nephew behind that gay horse of his.\" \"You can speak to him about it,\" said Mrs. Kent. \"I believe he prefers to be alone.\" \"Oh, he\u0027ll be willing to treat his uncle to a ride. I\u0027ll give him a few hints about driving.\" Mrs. Kent winced. She was proud, and she did not fancy exhibiting Dick to the village people as her brother. But there seemed no way of avoiding it. She privately determined to get rid of him as soon as possible. \"I must leave you now,\" she said, gathering up her work. \"I will ask the servant to show you your room.\" \"All right, Helen. Don\u0027t trouble yourself about me. I\u0027ll make myself at home.\" \"I\u0027m afraid you will,\" thought his sister. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2967/81695.html","bookId":378,"book":{"id":378,"title":"Frank and Fearless or The Fortunes of Jasper Kent","description":"简介： A dozen boys were playing ball in a field adjoining the boarding-school of Dr. Pericles Benton, in the town of Walltham, a hundred and twenty-five miles northeast of the city of New York.
