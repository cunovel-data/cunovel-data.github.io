{"id":23955,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. THE SLEEPING POTION.","content":"Presently the old man already referred to appeared with the drinks. It Is hardly necessary to say that Jasper was alone in his choice of lemonade. The rest selected stronger liquors. \"Here\u0027s to you, Dick,\" said Jack, tossing off the contents of his glass, \"and may you live to treat us many times more!\" \"Amen to that!\" said Bill. \"Haven\u0027t you got anything to say, youngster?\" asked Dick, turning to Jasper. \"I wish you a pleasant journey,\" said Jasper, politely. \"As to that, it depends on my success with my sister.\" \"When do you leave?\" \"To-night, if I can.\" \"What\u0027s all that about, Dick? Are you going to leave us?\" asked Bill. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 East for the benefit of my health and my purse,\" said Dick, with a grin. \"Do you wish me success, mates?\" \"To be sure. Is it anything we can help you in?\" \"No, no. It\u0027s my private venture.\" \"Anything in my line?\" \"No; it\u0027s a strictly virtuous and honest undertaking. I don\u0027t mind giving you a hint of it. I\u0027ve got a near relative that\u0027s come into a fortune. Now I think I ought to come in for a share.\" \"To be sure!\" \"Have another game of euchre, Dick?\" \"I don\u0027t know—I ought to be going,\" said the kidnapper, hesitating. \"We\u0027ll make it poker, and the boy may take a hand.\" \"No,\" said Jasper, languidly. \"I don\u0027t know how to play.\" \"We\u0027ll teach you.\" \"I don\u0027t care about it.\" \"You look sleepy, lad,\" said Dick. \"Yes, I feel so. It\u0027s strange. I didn\u0027t feel so when I came in.\" \"Oh, don\u0027t mind the boy\u0027s looks,\" said Jack. \"Lay down on that settee, if you want to, boy.\" Jasper felt so heavy and drowsy that he accepted the permission and stretched himself out, closing his eyes. \"Why am I so sleepy?\" he thought, languidly. \"I never was before, in the middle of the day, except when I was sick.\" He listened at first to the conversation between the players, but gradually it sounded only like a confused hum, and at length he could not hear it at all. He was fast asleep. When this became clear through his heavy breathing, Dick turned to the younger man, and pointing to Jasper, asked: \"What have you been doing to him?\" \"I put a sleeping potion into his drink,\" answered Jack. \"What for?\" \"I mean to keep him for a while, and that saves a fuss.\" \"What do you want to do with him?\" \"Prevent him from doing mischief.\" \"There\u0027s no need. He can be trusted.\" \"You can trust him, for you\u0027ll be a long way off. He might blow on us any time.\" Dick shrugged his shoulders. \"Oh, well, do as you please, but you\u0027re over careful. Don\u0027t hurt him.\" \"He\u0027ll be all right as long as he behaves himself. It\u0027s your deal.\" The game was over at last, and Dick arose to go. Jasper was sleeping soundly, and was wholly unconscious of his departure. \"Give me a hand, Bill, and we\u0027ll take the boy up stairs,\" said the younger man. \"What\u0027s your plan, Jack?\" \"To make him one of us. He\u0027ll come to it in time.\" There was a windowless room on the second floor, in the centre of the house, wholly dark, except when lighted by gas. It was to this room that our hero was conveyed, and laid upon some bedding in the corner of the room. There was a slide in the partition to admit air, and with it a few faint rays of light. Jasper stirred a little while he was being moved, but the sleeping potion had too much potency to allow him to wake. \"There,\" said Jack, in a tone of satisfaction, \"he\u0027s safe now.\" \"He\u0027ll make a fuss when he gets up.\" \"Let him. He can\u0027t get out.\" As they went down stairs, Jack called aside Nathan Gibson, the old man who had charge of the house. \"Nathan,\" said he, \"did you see the boy that was with us just now?\" \"Yes.\" \"We\u0027ve put him in the prison\" (for this was the name by which the small dark room was known). \"He\u0027s not to be let out.\" \"Good! I understand.\" \"You may take him some supper at five or six o\u0027clock. Look in before that time to see if he\u0027s awake.\" \"All right!\" said the old man, grinning. \"What\u0027s your game?\" \"It\u0027s your game as well as mine. The boy ought never to have come here. He may blow on us.\" The mean-faced little man looked by turns frightened and fierce. \"I\u0027d slit his throat if he did!\" he said. \"No need of that. We\u0027ll make him join us.\" \"That would be the best way; but can you?\" \"We can try. Don\u0027t forget what I told you.\" Nathan nodded. Still Jasper slept, little suspecting into what a trap he had walked. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2967/81687.html","bookId":378,"book":{"id":378,"title":"Frank and Fearless or The Fortunes of Jasper Kent","description":"简介： A dozen boys were playing ball in a field adjoining the boarding-school of Dr. Pericles Benton, in the town of Walltham, a hundred and twenty-five miles northeast of the city of New York.
