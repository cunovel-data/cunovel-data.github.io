{"id":23957,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. IN CONFINEMENT.","content":"Soon the old man reappeared and opened the sliding-door. He carried a small waiter containing a cup of tea, a plate of cold meat, and a slice of white bread without butter. \"We don\u0027t want you to starve,\" he said. \"Here\u0027s something to stay your stomach. You\u0027re hungry, ain\u0027t you?\" Jasper admitted that he was. \"I thought so. When I was your age I was always eating. Never could get enough.\" Jasper wondered, if this were the case, why the old man had not grown larger, but he did not say this. He took the waiter from Nathan and set it on his lap, there being no table. \"I hope you don\u0027t mean to keep me long as a boarder,\" he said. \"You won\u0027t find it profitable, boarding me for nothing.\" \"That isn\u0027t for me to say,\" said Nathan. \"Jack and Bill will see to that.\" \"Did they tell you to confine me?\" \"Yes; I told you that already.\" \"Will you ask them to come up and speak to me? I want to know why I am here.\" \"They ain\u0027t at home now. I\u0027ll tell them when they come in.\" \"Thank you. Do you think that will be to-night?\" \"Not likely. They\u0027ll come in so late you\u0027ll be abed and asleep.\" \"Don\u0027t let them go out to-morrow morning without seeing me.\" \"I\u0027ll tell them.\" The old man waited till Jasper had finished eating, and then took the waiter back through the window. \"Won\u0027t you let me have a light?\" asked Jasper. \"I don\u0027t want to stay here in the dark.\" \"You\u0027ll set the house on fire,\" said the old man, hesitating. \"And get burned up myself? I should be fool to run such a risk as that.\" This consideration suggested itself to the old man\u0027s judgment, and he promised to bring up a lamp before long. This he really did. Jasper found it a great relief. He was now broad awake, the effect of the drug having passed off. There was nothing to do, indeed, but his thoughts were busy, and he tried hard to devise some method of escape, in case he should not be released. The next morning breakfast was brought to him about eight o\u0027clock. It was not till ten that the sliding-door was opened and the face of Jack appeared at the opening. \"Well, boy, how do you like your quarters?\" he asked, with a disagreeable smile. \"Not at all,\" answered Jasper. \"Why do you keep me here?\" \"We had reasons for putting you here.\" \"What were they?\" \"First and foremost, you knew too much.\" \"Were you afraid I should betray you?\" asked Jasper. \"You might.\" \"I promise not to, if you will let me go.\" \"That\u0027s all very well, but when you get out you might break your promise.\" \"Then it would be for the first time,\" said Jasper, proudly. \"I never break my promises.\" \"You talk well, boy, but it\u0027s easy to talk.\" \"It\u0027s all I can do. There is no way of proving what I say.\" \"That\u0027s so; and that\u0027s the reason I\u0027m going to keep you.\" \"At that rate, you will have to keep me all my life.\" \"No; there\u0027s another way.\" \"What is it?\" asked Jasper, eagerly. \"Join us, and when you\u0027re in the same box you won\u0027t go to blabbing.\" \"What do you mean by joining you?\" asked Jasper, though he was afraid he understood only too well. \"You ought to be smart enough to know that.\" \"I don\u0027t know what your business is,\" said our hero. \"You don\u0027t!\" said Jack, ironically. \"Perhaps you think we\u0027re commission merchants, or bankers, or something of that kind, Bill and me?\" \"I don\u0027t think you are either of them,\" said Jasper, laughing. \"Why not?\" \"You don\u0027t look like a commission merchant or a banker.\" \"What do I look like, eh, boy?\" \"You may be angry if I answer that question.\" \"No, I won\u0027t. Go ahead!\" \"You look as if you didn\u0027t get your living in any way so honest as that.\" \"Well, suppose you are right?\" \"Then I am sorry. I wish you would reform and lead a different life.\" \"No preaching! I didn\u0027t bargain for that.\" \"Then all I have to say is, you are in no danger from me. I shall not betray you.\" \"Perhaps you are to be trusted, but I can\u0027t run the risk. You must join us.\" \"You may be wicked yourself. You have no right to make me so,\" said Jasper, firmly. \"That\u0027s all nonsense. The world owes me a living, and you, too.\" \"Not without work. I\u0027m going to work for my living.\" \"I mean you shall. You shall work for me.\" \"That kind of work will do the world no good. I want to do something useful.\" \"So you shall. You shall help us bleed some of these bloated aristocrats. They\u0027ve got more money than is good for them—more than they have any business to keep.\" \"I don\u0027t agree with you,\" said Jasper. \"You\u0027d better. It is for your interest,\" said Jack, frowning. \"It can\u0027t be for my interest to become a law-breaker.\" \"Then you can stay here till you rot!\" retorted the burglar, roughly. \"You won\u0027t come out of this chamber till you have agreed to become one of us.\" There was something in this threat which startled Jasper, bold and brave as he was. \"Such an outrage won\u0027t be permitted,\" he said. \"Won\u0027t it?\" sneered Jack. \"We\u0027ll see about that. I\u0027ll take the risk. You don\u0027t know me yet,\" he added, with an oath. \"Is it wholly because you are afraid I will betray you that you treat me in this way?\" asked Jasper. \"No.\" \"What other reason have you?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you. You\u0027re the sort of boy we want. You ain\u0027t any whining, milk-and-water sort of boy. You\u0027re brave and spirited. You would be worth a good deal to us.\" Burglar though Jack was, Jasper was not insensible to the compliment. Any boy likes to be considered spirited, even if he does not deserve it, and he felt flattered by this tribute, which he felt that he deserved, at least, in part. \"I am glad you have a good opinion of my courage,\" he said, \"but I think I can find a better use for it than in the career you open to me. If I accepted your proposal from fear of imprisonment it would show that I was not such a boy as you describe.\" \"You are an obstinate fool!\" said Jack, with a frown. \"I am obstinate in this,\" said Jasper, composedly. \"You want to spoil my life by making me a criminal.\" \"Do you mean to call me a criminal!\" exclaimed Jack, angrily. \"I call you nothing—I only take you at your word.\" \"You\u0027ll talk differently from this a week from now!\" said Jack, prepariug to shut the sliding-door. \"Do you mean to keep me in this dark hole a week?\" asked Jasper, unable to repress a shudder. \"Ha! that disturbs you, does it?\" asked the other, smiling sardonically. \"Yes, it does. You don\u0027t think I fancy it, do you?\" \"Well, you know the way to end your imprisonment.\" \"Is there only one way?\" \"There\u0027s only one way. Tell the old man, Nathan, when you\u0027ve made up your mind to accept my offer.\" Without waiting for a reply Jack pushed the sliding-door in its place, and once more Jasper found himself in the dark. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2967/81689.html","bookId":378,"book":{"id":378,"title":"Frank and Fearless or The Fortunes of Jasper Kent","description":"简介： A dozen boys were playing ball in a field adjoining the boarding-school of Dr. Pericles Benton, in the town of Walltham, a hundred and twenty-five miles northeast of the city of New York.
