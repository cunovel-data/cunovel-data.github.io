[bbe] Then Darius the king gave an order and a search was made in the house of the records, where the things of value were stored up in Babylon. 6:2 [hgb] 在 玛 代 省 亚 马 他 城 的 宫 内 寻 得 一 卷 ， 其 中 记 着 说 ， [kjv] And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written: [bbe] And at Achmetha, in the great house of the king in the land of Media, they came across a roll, in which this statement was put on record: 6:3 [hgb] 古 列 王 元 年 ， 他 降 旨 论 到 耶 路 撒 冷 神 的 殿 ， 要 建 造 这 殿 为 献 祭 之 处 ， 坚 立 殿 的 根 基 。 殿 高 六 十 肘 ， 宽 六 十 肘 ， [kjv] In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits; [bbe] In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made an order: In connection with the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be put up, the place where they make offerings, and let the earth for the bases be put in place; let it be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide; 6:4 [hgb] 用 三 层 大 石 头 ， 一 层 新 木 头 ， 经 费 要 出 于 王 库 。 [kjv] With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king\u0027s house: [bbe] With three lines of great stones and one line of new wood supports; and let the necessary money be given out of the king\u0027s store-house; 6:5 [hgb] 并 且 神 殿 的 金 银 器 皿 ， 就 是 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 从 耶 路 撒 冷 的 殿 中 掠 到 巴 比 伦 的 ， 要 归 还 带 到 耶 路 撒 冷 的 殿 中 ， 各 按 原 处 放 在 神 的 殿 里 。 [kjv] And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God. [bbe] And let the gold and silver vessels from the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple at Jerusalem to Babylon, be given back and taken again to the Temple at Jerusalem, every one in its place, and put them in the house of God. 6:6 [hgb] 现 在 河 西 的 总 督 达 乃 和 示 他 波 斯 乃 ， 并 你 们 的 同 党 ， 就 是 住 河 西 的 亚 法 萨 迦 人 ， 你 们 当 远 离 他 们 。 [kjv] Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence: [bbe] So now, Tattenai, ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai and your people the Apharsachites across the river, keep far from that place: 6:7 [hgb] 不 要 拦 阻 神 殿 的 工 作 ， 任 凭 犹 大 人 的 省 长 ， 和 犹 大 人 的 长 老 ， 在 原 处 建 造 神 的 这 殿 。 [kjv] Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place. [bbe] Let the work of this house of God go on; let the ruler of the Jews and their responsible men put up this house of God in its place. 6:8 [hgb] 我 又 降 旨 ， 吩 咐 你 们 向 犹 大 人 的 长 老 为 建 造 神 的 殿 当 怎 样 行 ， 就 是 从 河 西 的 款 项 中 ， 急 速 拨 取 贡 银 作 他 们 的 经 费 ， 免 得 耽 误 工 作 。 [kjv] Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king\u0027s goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered. [bbe] Further, I give orders as to what you are to do for the responsible men of the Jews in connection with the building of this house of God: that from the king\u0027s wealth, that is, from the taxes got together in the land over the river, the money needed is to be given to these men readily, so that their work may not be stopped. 6:9 [hgb] 他 们 与 天 上 的 神 献 燔 祭 所 需 用 的 公 牛 犊 ， 公 绵 羊 ， 绵 羊 羔 ， 并 所 用 的 麦 子 ， 盐 ， 酒 ， 油 ， 都 要 照 耶 路 撒 冷 祭 司 的 话 ， 每 日 供 给 他 们 ， 不 得 有 误 。 [kjv] And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: [bbe] And whatever they have need of, young oxen and sheep and lambs, for burned offerings to the God of heaven, grain, salt, wine, and oil, whatever the priests in Jerusalem say is necessary, is to be given to them day by day regularly: 6:10 [hgb] 好 叫 他 们 献 馨 香 的 祭 给 天 上 的 神 ， 又 为 王 和 王 众 子 的 寿 命 祈 祷 。 [kjv] That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. [bbe] So that they may make offerings of a sweet smell to the God of heaven, with prayers for the life of the king and of his sons. 6:11 [hgb] 我 再 降 旨 ， 无 论 谁 更 改 这 命 令 ， 必 从 他 房 屋 中 拆 出 一 根 梁 来 ， 把 他 举 起 ， 悬 在 其 上 ， 又 使 他 的 房 屋 成 为 粪 堆 。 [kjv] Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. [bbe] And I have given orders that if anyone makes any change in this word, one of the supports is to be pulled out of his house, and he is to be lifted up and fixed to it; and his house is to be made waste for this; 6:12 [hgb] 若 有 王 和 民 伸 手 更 改 这 命 令 ， 拆 毁 这 殿 ， 愿 那 使 耶 路 撒 冷 的 殿 作 为 他 名 居 所 的 神 将 他 们 灭 绝 。 我 大 利 乌 降 这 旨 意 ， 当 速 速 遵 行 。 [kjv] And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed. [bbe] And may the God who has made it a resting-place for his name send destruction on all kings and peoples whose hands are outstretched to make any change in this or to do damage to this house of God at Jerusalem. I, Darius, have given this order, let it be done with all care. 6:13 [hgb] 于 是 ， 河 西 总 督 达 乃 和 示 他 波 斯 乃 ， 并 他 们 的 同 党 ， 因 大 利 乌 王 所 发 的 命 令 ， 就 急 速 遵 行 。 [kjv] Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily. [bbe] Then Tattenai, the ruler across the river, and Shethar-bozenai and their people, because of the order given by King Darius, did as he had said with all care. 6:14 [hgb] 犹 大 长 老 ， 因 先 知 哈 该 ， 和 易 多 的 孙 子 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 所 说 劝 勉 的 话 ， 就 建 造 这 殿 ， 凡 事 亨 通 。 他 们 遵 着 以 色 列 神 的 命 令 ， 和 波 斯 王 古 列 ， 大 利 乌 ， 亚 达 薛 西 的 旨 意 ， 建 造 完 毕 。 [kjv] And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. [bbe] And the responsible men of the Jews went on with their building, and did well, helped by the teaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, the son of Iddo. They went on building till it was complete, in keeping with the word of the God of Israel, and the orders given by Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes, king of Persia. 6:15 [hgb] 大 利 乌 王 第 六 年 ， 亚 达 月 初 三 日 ， 这 殿 修 成 了 。 [kjv] And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.

[bbe] And they put the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their order, for the worship of God at Jerusalem; as it is recorded in the book of Moses. 6:19 [hgb] 正 月 十 四 日 ， 被 掳 归 回 的 人 守 逾 越 节 。 [kjv] And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month. [bbe] And the children of Israel who had come back kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. 6:20 [hgb] 原 来 ， 祭 司 和 利 未 人 一 同 自 洁 ， 无 一 人 不 洁 净 。 利 未 人 为 被 掳 归 回 的 众 人 和 他 们 的 弟 兄 众 祭 司 ， 并 为 自 己 宰 逾 越 节 的 羊 羔 。 [kjv] For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. [bbe] For the priests and the Levites had made themselves clean together; they were all clean: and they put the Passover lamb to death for all those who had come back, and for their brothers the priests and for themselves. 6:21 [hgb] 从 掳 到 之 地 归 回 的 以 色 列 人 ， 和 一 切 除 掉 所 染 外 邦 人 污 秽 ， 归 附 他 们 ， 要 寻 求 耶 和 华 以 色 列 神 的 人 都 吃 这 羊 羔 ， [kjv] And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat, [bbe] And the children of Israel, who had come back, and all those who were joined to them, after separating themselves from the evil ways of the people of the land to become the servants of the Lord, the God of Israel, took food together, 6:22 [hgb] 欢 欢 喜 喜 地 守 除 酵 节 七 日 。 因 为 耶 和 华 使 他 们 欢 喜 ， 又 使 亚 述 王 的 心 转 向 他 们 ， 坚 固 他 们 的 手 ， 作 以 色 列 神 殿 的 工 程 。 [kjv] And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
