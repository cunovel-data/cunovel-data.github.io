[bbe] And when the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the towns, the people came together like one man to Jerusalem. 3:2 [hgb] 约 萨 达 的 儿 子 耶 书 亚 和 他 的 弟 兄 众 祭 司 ， 并 撒 拉 铁 的 儿 子 所 罗 巴 伯 ， 与 他 的 弟 兄 ， 都 起 来 建 筑 以 色 列 神 的 坛 ， 要 照 神 人 摩 西 律 法 书 上 所 写 的 ， 在 坛 上 献 燔 祭 。 [kjv] Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God. [bbe] Then Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, with his brothers, got up and made the altar of the God of Israel for burned offerings as is recorded in the law of Moses, the man of God. 3:3 [hgb] 他 们 在 原 有 的 根 基 上 筑 坛 ， 因 惧 怕 邻 国 的 民 ， 又 在 其 上 向 耶 和 华 早 晚 献 燔 祭 。 [kjv] And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening. [bbe] They put the altar on its base; for fear was on them because of the people of the countries: and they made burned offerings on it to the Lord, even burned offerings morning and evening. 3:4 [hgb] 又 照 律 法 书 上 所 写 的 守 住 棚 节 ， 按 数 照 例 献 每 日 所 当 献 的 燔 祭 。 [kjv] They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required; [bbe] And they kept the feast of tents, as it is recorded, making the regular burned offerings every day by number, as it is ordered; for every day what was needed. 3:5 [hgb] 其 后 献 常 献 的 燔 祭 ， 并 在 月 朔 与 耶 和 华 的 一 切 圣 节 献 祭 ， 又 向 耶 和 华 献 各 人 的 甘 心 祭 。 [kjv] And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD. [bbe] And after that, the regular burned offering and the offerings for the new moons and all the fixed feasts of the Lord which had been made holy, and the offering of everyone who freely gave his offering to the Lord. 3:6 [hgb] 从 七 月 初 一 日 起 ， 他 们 就 向 耶 和 华 献 燔 祭 。 但 耶 和 华 殿 的 根 基 尚 未 立 定 。 [kjv] From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid. [bbe] From the first day of the seventh month they made a start with the burned offerings, but the base of the Temple of the Lord had still not been put in its place. 3:7 [hgb] 他 们 又 将 银 子 给 石 匠 ， 木 匠 。 把 粮 食 ， 酒 ， 油 给 西 顿 人 ， 推 罗 人 ， 使 他 们 将 香 柏 树 从 利 巴 嫩 运 到 海 里 ， 浮 海 运 到 约 帕 ， 是 照 波 斯 王 古 列 所 允 准 的 。 [kjv] They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. [bbe] And they gave money to the stoneworkers and woodworkers; and meat and drink and oil to the people of Zidon and of Tyre, for the transport of cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, as Cyrus, king of Persia, had given them authority to do. 3:8 [hgb] 百 姓 到 了 耶 路 撒 冷 神 殿 的 地 方 。 第 二 年 二 月 ， 撒 拉 铁 的 儿 子 所 罗 巴 伯 ， 约 萨 达 的 儿 子 ， 耶 书 亚 和 其 余 的 弟 兄 ， 就 是 祭 司 ， 利 未 人 ， 并 一 切 被 掳 归 回 耶 路 撒 冷 的 人 ， 都 兴 工 建 造 。 又 派 利 未 人 ， 从 二 十 岁 以 外 的 ， 督 理 建 造 耶 和 华 殿 的 工 作 。 [kjv] Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD. [bbe] Now in the second year of their coming into the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, the work was taken in hand by Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come from the land where they were prisoners to Jerusalem: and they made the Levites, of twenty years old and over, responsible for overseeing the work of the house of the Lord. 3:9 [hgb] 于 是 犹 大 （ 在 二 章 四 十 节 作 何 达 威 雅 ） 的 后 裔 ， 就 是 耶 书 亚 和 他 的 子 孙 与 弟 兄 。 甲 篾 和 他 的 子 孙 ， 利 未 人 希 拿 达 的 子 孙 与 弟 兄 ， 都 一 同 起 来 ， 督 理 那 在 神 殿 做 工 的 人 。 [kjv] Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites. [bbe] Then Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel with his sons, the sons of Hodaviah, together took up the work of overseeing the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brothers, the Levites. 3:10 [hgb] 匠 人 立 耶 和 华 殿 根 基 的 时 候 ， 祭 司 皆 穿 礼 服 吹 号 ， 亚 萨 的 子 孙 利 未 人 敲 钹 ， 照 以 色 列 王 大 卫 所 定 的 例 ， 都 站 着 赞 美 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. [bbe] And when the builders put in position the base of the Temple of the Lord, the priests, dressed in their robes, took their places with horns, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with brass instruments, to give praise to the Lord in the way ordered by David, king of Israel. 3:11 [hgb] 他 们 彼 此 唱 和 ， 赞 美 称 谢 耶 和 华 说 ， 他 本 为 善 ， 他 向 以 色 列 人 永 发 慈 爱 。 他 们 赞 美 耶 和 华 的 时 候 ， 众 民 大 声 呼 喊 ， 因 耶 和 华 殿 的 根 基 已 经 立 定 。 [kjv] And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. [bbe] And they gave praise to the Lord, answering one another in their songs and saying, For he is good, for his mercy to Israel is eternal. And all the people gave a great cry of joy, when they gave praise to the Lord, because the base of the Lord\u0027s house was put in place. 3:12 [hgb] 然 而 有 许 多 祭 司 ， 利 未 人 ， 族 长 ， 就 是 见 过 旧 殿 的 老 年 人 ， 现 在 亲 眼 看 见 立 这 殿 的 根 基 ， 便 大 声 哭 号 ， 也 有 许 多 人 大 声 欢 呼 。 [kjv] But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: [bbe] But a number of the priests and Levites and the heads of families, old men who had seen the first house, when the base of this house was put down before their eyes, were overcome with weeping; and a number were crying out with joy: 3:13 [hgb] 甚 至 百 姓 不 能 分 辨 欢 呼 的 声 音 ， 和 哭 号 的 声 音 。 因 为 众 人 大 声 呼 喊 ， 声 音 听 到 远 处 。 [kjv] So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off. [bbe] So that in the ears of the people the cry of joy was mixed with the sound of weeping; for the cries of the people were loud and came to the ears of those who were a long way off.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/111/1583.html","bookId":185,"book":{"id":185,"title":"以 斯 拉 记 Ezra","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 波 斯 王 古 列 元 年 ， 耶 和 华 为 要 应 验 借 耶 利 米 口 所 说 的 话 ， 就 激 动 波 斯 王 古 列 的 心 ， 使 他 下 诏 通 告 全 国 ， 说 ， [kjv] Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/111","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
