\n [bbe] At the same time, Tattenai, ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and their men, came to them and said, Who gave you orders to go on building this house and this wall? \n 5:4 [hgb] 我 们 便 告 诉 他 们 建 造 这 殿 的 人 叫 什 么 名 字 。 \n [kjv] Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? \n [bbe] Then they said these words to them: What are the names of the men who are at work on this building? \n 5:5 [hgb] 神 的 眼 目 看 顾 犹 大 的 长 老 ， 以 致 总 督 等 没 有 叫 他 们 停 工 ， 直 到 这 事 奏 告 大 利 乌 得 着 他 的 回 谕 。 \n [kjv] But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter. \n [bbe] But the eye of their God was on the chiefs of the Jews, and they did not make them give up working till the question had been put before Darius and an answer had come by letter about it. \n 5:6 [hgb] 河 西 的 总 督 达 乃 和 示 他 波 斯 乃 ， 并 他 们 的 同 党 ， 就 是 住 河 西 的 亚 法 萨 迦 人 ， 上 本 奏 告 大 利 乌 王 。 \n [kjv] The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: \n [bbe] This is a copy of the letter which Tattenai, the ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai and his friends the Apharsachites, living across the river, sent to Darius the king: \n 5:7 [hgb] 本 上 写 着 说 ， 愿 大 利 乌 王 诸 事 平 安 。 \n [kjv] They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace. \n [bbe] They sent him a letter saying, To Darius the king, all peace: \n 5:8 [hgb] 王 该 知 道 ， 我 们 往 犹 大 省 去 ， 到 了 至 大 神 的 殿 ， 这 殿 是 用 大 石 建 造 的 。 梁 木 插 入 墙 内 ， 工 作 甚 速 ， 他 们 手 下 亨 通 。 \n [kjv] Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands. \n [bbe] This is to give the king word that we went into the land of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is made of great stones, and has its walls supported with wood, and the work is going on with industry, and they are doing it well. \n 5:9 [hgb] 我 们 就 问 那 些 长 老 说 ， 谁 降 旨 让 你 们 建 造 这 殿 ， 修 成 这 墙 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls? \n [bbe] Then we said to the men responsible, who gave you authority for the building of this house and these walls? \n 5:10 [hgb] 又 问 他 们 的 名 字 ， 要 记 录 他 们 首 领 的 名 字 ， 奏 告 于 王 。 \n [kjv] We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them. \n [bbe] And we made request for their names, so that we might send you word, and give you the names of the men at the head of them. \n 5:11 [hgb] 他 们 回 答 说 ， 我 们 是 天 地 之 神 的 仆 人 ， 重 建 前 多 年 所 建 造 的 殿 ， 就 是 以 色 列 的 一 位 大 君 王 建 造 修 成 的 。 \n [kjv] And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up. \n [bbe] And they made answer to us, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the house which was put up in times long past and was designed and made complete by a great king of Israel. \n 5:12 [hgb] 只 因 我 们 列 祖 惹 天 上 的 神 发 怒 ， 神 把 他 们 交 在 迦 勒 底 人 ， 巴 比 伦 王 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 的 手 中 ， 他 就 拆 毁 这 殿 ， 又 将 百 姓 掳 到 巴 比 伦 。 \n [kjv] But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. \n [bbe] But when the God of heaven was moved to wrath by our fathers, he gave them up into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the Chaldaean, who sent destruction on this house and took the people away into Babylon. \n 5:13 [hgb] 然 而 巴 比 伦 王 古 列 元 年 ， 他 降 旨 允 准 建 造 神 的 这 殿 。 \n [kjv] But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. \n [bbe] But in the first year of Cyrus, king of Babylon, Cyrus the king gave an order for the building of this house of God; \n 5:14 [hgb] 神 殿 中 的 金 ， 银 器 皿 ， 就 是 尼 布 甲 尼 撒 从 耶 路 撒 冷 的 殿 中 掠 去 ， 带 到 巴 比 伦 庙 里 的 ， 古 列 王 从 巴 比 伦 庙 里 取 出 来 ， 交 给 派 为 省 长 的 ， 名 叫 设 巴 萨 ， \n [kjv] And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; \n [bbe] And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple which was in Jerusalem, and put into the house of his god in Babylon, these Cyrus the king took from the house of his god in Babylon, and gave to one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made ruler; \n 5:15 [hgb] 对 他 说 可 以 将 这 些 器 皿 带 去 ， 放 在 耶 路 撒 冷 的 殿 中 ， 在 原 处 建 造 神 的 殿 。 \n [kjv] And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place. \n [bbe] And he said to him, Go, take these vessels, and put them in the Temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be put up again in its place. \n 5:16 [hgb] 于 是 这 设 巴 萨 来 建 立 耶 路 撒 冷 神 殿 的 根 基 。 这 殿 从 那 时 直 到 如 今 尚 未 造 成 。 \n [kjv] Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished. \n [bbe] Then this same Sheshbazzar came and put the house of God in Jerusalem on its bases: and from that time till now the building has been going on, but it is still not complete. \n 5:17 [hgb] 现 在 王 若 以 为 美 ， 请 察 巴 比 伦 王 的 府 库 ， 看 古 列 王 降 旨 允 准 在 耶 路 撒 冷 建 造 神 的 殿 没 有 ， 王 的 心 意 如 何 。 请 降 旨 晓 谕 我 们 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king\u0027s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter. \n [bbe] So now, if it seems good to the king, let search be made in the king\u0027s store-house at Babylon, to see if it is true that an order was given by Cyrus the king for the building of this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us word of his pleasure in connection with this business. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/111/1585.html","bookId":185,"book":{"id":185,"title":"以 斯 拉 记 Ezra","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 波 斯 王 古 列 元 年 ， 耶 和 华 为 要 应 验 借 耶 利 米 口 所 说 的 话 ， 就 激 动 波 斯 王 古 列 的 心 ， 使 他 下 诏 通 告 全 国 ， 说 ， [kjv] Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/111","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:22 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:44 AM"}}
