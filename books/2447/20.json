{"id":79788,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Debbie stopped me. \"No!\" she screamed, racing up behind me. There was such terror in her voice, that even in the midst of my bloodlust, I paused. She pulled up beside me, panting hard, eyes wide with horror. \"No!\" she wheezed, shaking her head desperately.\n \"Why not?\" I snarled.\n \"He\u0027s a child!\" she cried.\n \"No - he\u0027s Steve Leopard\u0027s son,\" I contradicted her. \"A killer, like his father.\"\n \"He hasn\u0027t killed anyone,\" Debbie objected. \"Morgan James killed Mr Tall. Now he\u0027s dead, you\u0027re even. You don\u0027t have to kill the boy too.\"\n \"I\u0027ll kill them all!\" I screamed madly. It was like I\u0027d become a different person, a bloodthirsty reaper. \"Every vampaneze must die! Every vampet! Everyone who aids them!\"\n \"Even the children?\" Debbie asked sickly.\n \"Yes!\" I roared. My headache was the worst it had ever been. It was like red-hot pins were being pushed through my skull from the inside out. Part of me knew this was wrong, but a larger part had seized on the hatred and urge to kill. That merciless part was screaming for revenge.\n \"Harkat,\" Debbie appealed to the Little Person. \"Make him see sense!\"\n Harkat shook his neckless head. \"I don\u0027t think I can stop him,\" he said, staring at me as if he didn\u0027t know me.\n \"You have to try!\" Debbie shrieked.\n \"I don\u0027t know if I? have the right,\" Harkat muttered.\n Debbie turned to me again. She was crying. \"You mustn\u0027t do this,\" she wept.\n \"It\u0027s my duty,\" I said stiffly.\n She spat at my feet. \"That\u0027s what I think of yourduty ! You\u0027ll become a monster if you kill that boy. You\u0027ll be no better than Steve.\"\n I stopped. Her words had sparked a memory deep within me. I found myself thinking about Mr Crepsley and his last words to me before he died. He warned me not to devote my life to hatred. Kill Steve Leopard if the chance presented itself - but don\u0027t give myself over to some insane revenge quest.\n What would he have done in my place? Kill the boy? Yes, if necessary. Butwas it? Did I want to kill Darius because I feared him and felt he had to be eliminated for the good of us all - or because I wanted to hurt Steve?\n I gazed into the boy\u0027s eyes. They were fearful, but behind the fear there was? sorrow. In Steve\u0027s eyes, evil lurked deep down. Not in Darius. He was more human than his father.\n My knife was still pressed to his throat. It had sliced thinly into his flesh. Little rivulets of blood trickled down his neck.\n \"You\u0027ll destroy yourself,\" Debbie whispered hoarsely. \"You\u0027ll be worse than Steve.He can\u0027t tell the difference between right and wrong.You can. He can live with his wickedness because he doesn\u0027t know any better, but it will eat you away. Don\u0027t do it, Darren. We don\u0027t wage war on children.\"\n I stared at her, tears in my eyes. I knew she was right. I wanted to take the knife away. I couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d even tried to kill the boy. But still there was part of me that wanted to take his life. Something had awoken within me, a Darren Shan I\u0027d never known existed, and he wasn\u0027t going to lie down without a fight. My fingers shook as they held the knife, but the furious angel of revenge inside me wouldn\u0027t let me lower them.\n \"Go ahead and kill me,\" Darius snarled suddenly. \"It\u0027s what your kind does. You\u0027re murderers. I know all about you, so stop pretending you give a damn.\"\n \"What are you talking about?\" I said. He only smiled sickly in reply.\n \"He\u0027s Steve\u0027s son,\" Debbie said softly. \"He\u0027s been raised on lies. That\u0027s not his fault.\"\n \"My father doesn\u0027t lie!\" Darius shouted.\n Debbie moved around behind Darius so she could look me straight in the eye. \"He doesn\u0027t know the truth. He\u0027s innocent, in spite of anything he\u0027s been tricked into doing. Don\u0027t kill an innocent, Darren. Don\u0027t become that which you despise.\"\n I groaned deeply. More than ever I wanted to take the knife away, but still I wavered, fighting an inner battle which I didn\u0027t completely understand. \"I don\u0027t know what to do!\" I moaned.\n \"Then think of this,\" Harkat said. \"We might need the boy to swap? for Shancus. It makes sense not to kill him.\"\n The fire within me died away. I lowered the knife, feeling a great weight lift from my heart. I smiled crookedly. \"Thanks, Harkat.\"\n \"You shouldn\u0027t have needed that,\" Debbie said as I spun Darius around and tied his hands behind him with a strip of cloth which Harkat had ripped from his robes. \"You should have spared him because it was the right thing to do - not because you might need him.\"\n \"Maybe,\" I agreed, ashamed of my reaction but not wanting to admit it. \"But it doesn\u0027t matter. We can debate it later. First, let\u0027s find out what\u0027s happening with Shancus. Where\u0027s your phone?\"\n A minute later she was deep in conversation with Alice Burgess. They were still in pursuit of R.V. and Shancus. Vancha asked to speak to me. \"We\u0027ve a choice to make,\" he said. \"I have R.V. in my sights. I can cut him down with a shuriken and rescue Shancus.\"\n \"Then why don\u0027t you?\" I frowned.\n \"I think he\u0027s leading us to Steve Leonard,\" Vancha said.\n I groaned softly and gripped the phone tightly. \"What does Evra say?\" I asked.\n \"This is our call, not his,\" Vancha responded with a whisper. \"He\u0027s thinking only of his son. We have other concerns to consider.\"\n \"I\u0027m not prepared to sacrifice Shancus to get to Steve,\" I said.\n \"I am,\" Vancha said quietly. \"But I doubt it will come to that. I think we can retrieve the boyand get a shot at Leonard. But it\u0027s a risk. If you want me to play it safe and kill R.V. now, I will. But I believe we should chance it, let him lead us to Leonard, and take it from there.\"\n \"You\u0027re the senior Prince,\" I said. \"You decide.\"\n \"No,\" Vancha retorted. \"We\u0027re equals. Shancus means more to you than he does to me. I\u0027ll follow your lead in this one.\"\n \"Thanks,\" I said bitterly.\n \"Sorry,\" Vancha said, and even over the phone I could tell his regret was genuine. \"I\u0027d take responsibility if I could, but on this occasion I can\u0027t. Do I kill R.V. or follow?\"\n My eyes flicked to Darius. If I\u0027d killed him, I\u0027d have told Vancha to bring R.V. down and save Shancus - otherwise Steve would surely slaughter the snake-boy in revenge. But if I turned up with Darius captive, Steve would have to trade. Once we had Shancus back, we\u0027d be free to pursue Steve later.\n \"OK,\" I said. \"Let him run. Tell me where you are and we\u0027ll catch up.\"\n A few minutes later we were on the move again, cutting across town, Debbie on the phone to Alice, taking directions. I could feel her eyes burning into my back - she didn\u0027t approve of the risk we were taking - but I didn\u0027t look around. As I ran, I kept reminding myself, \"I\u0027m a Prince. I have a duty to my people. The Lord of the Vampaneze takes priority over all.\" But it was a slim comfort, and I knew my sense of guilt and shame would be overwhelming if the gamble backfired. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-shadows-the-saga-of-darren-shan-11/page-20.html","bookId":2447,"book":{"id":2447,"title":"Lord of the Shadows (The Saga of Darren Shan #11)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #11: Lord of the Shadows \n Lord Of The Shadows is the eleventh book in The Saga of Darren Shan series by the author Darren Shan.
