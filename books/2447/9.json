Then there was the fact that I only looked a handful of years older. It was almost too much for him to comprehend. For a while he listened to me talk, nodding weakly, not taking anything in. But eventually his head cleared and he focused on what I was saying.\n I spun him a far-fetched but just about believable tale. I felt bad, lying to my old friend, but the truth was stranger than fiction - it was simpler and safer this way. I said I had a rare disease which prevented me from ageing normally. It was discovered when I was a child. The doctors gave me five or six years to live. My parents were devastated by the news, but since we could do nothing to prevent it, we told no one and tried to lead a normal life for as long as we could.\n Then the Cirque Du Freak came to town.\n \"I ran into an extraordinary physician,\" I lied. \"He was travelling with the Cirque, making a study of the freaks. He said he could help me, but I\u0027d have to leave home and travel with the Cirque - I\u0027d need constant monitoring. I talked it over with my parents and we decided to fake my death, so I could leave without arousing suspicions.\"\n \"But for heaven\u0027s sake, why?\" Tommy exploded. \"Your parents could have left with you. Why put everyone through so much pain?\"\n \"How would we have explained it?\" I sighed. \"The Cirque Du Freak is an illegal travelling show. My parents would have had to give up everything and gone undercover to be with me. It wouldn\u0027t have been fair on them, and it would have been dreadfully unfair on Annie.\"\n \"But there must have been some other way,\" Tommy protested.\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But we hadn\u0027t much time to think it over. The Cirque Du Freak was only in town for a few days. We discussed the proposal put forward by the physician and accepted it. I think the fact that I\u0027m still alive all these years later, against all medical odds, justifies that decision.\"\n Tommy shook his head uncertainly. He\u0027d grown up to be a very large man, tall and broad, with huge hands and bulging muscles. His black hair was receding prematurely - he\u0027d be bald in a few more years. But despite his physical presence, his eyes were soft. He was a gentle man. The idea of letting a child fake his death and be buried alive was repulsive to him.\n \"What\u0027s done is done,\" I said. \"Maybe my parents should have searched for another way. But they had my best interests at heart. Hope was offered and they seized it, regardlessof the terrible price.\"\n \"Did Annie know?\" Tommy asked.\n \"No. We never told her.\" I guessed Tommy had no way of contacting my parents directly, to check out my story, but he could have gone to Annie. I had to sidetrack him.\n \"Not even afterwards?\" Tommy asked.\n \"I talked aboutit with Mum and Dad - we keep in touch and meet up every few years - but we never felt the time was right. Annie had her own problems, having a baby so young.\"\n \"Thatwas tough,\" Tommy agreed. \"I was still living here. I didn\u0027t know her very well, but I heard all about it.\"\n \"That must have been just before your football career took off,\" I said, leading him away from talk about me. We discussed his career after that, some of the big matches he\u0027d been involved in, what he planned to do when he retired. He wasn\u0027t married but he had two kids from a previous relationship, when he\u0027d lived abroad.\n \"I only get to see them a couple of times a year and during the summer,\" he said sadly. \"I hope to move over there when I quit football, to be closer to them.\"\n Most of the performers, crew and guests had departed by this stage. Harkat had seen me talking with Tommy and made a sign askingif I wanted him to stick around. I signalled back that I was OK and he\u0027d left with the others. A few people still sat and talked softly in the tent, but nobody was near Tommy and me.\n Talk turned to the past and our old friends. Tommy told me Alan Morris had become a scientist. \"Quite a famous one too,\" he said. \"He\u0027s a geneticist - big into cloning. A controversial area, but he\u0027s convinced it\u0027s the way forward.\"\n \"As long as he doesn\u0027t clone himself!\" I laughed. \"One Alan Morris is enough!\"\n Tommy laughed too. Alan had been a close friend of ours, but he could be a bit of a pain at times.\n \"I\u0027ve no idea what Steve\u0027s up to,\" Tommy said, and the laughter died on my lips. \"He left home at sixteen. Ran off without a word to anyone. I\u0027ve spoken to him on the phone a few times, but I\u0027ve only seen him once since then, about ten years ago. He returned home for a few months when his mother died.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know she was dead,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sorry. I liked Steve\u0027s Mum.\"\n \"He sold off the house and all her effects. He shared an apartment with Alan for a while. That was before?\" Tommy stopped and glanced at me oddly. \"Haveyou seen Steve since you left?\"\n \"No,\" I lied.\n \"You don\u0027t know anything about him?\"\n \"No,\" I lied again.\n \"Nothing at all?\" Tommy pressed.\n I forced a chuckle. \"Why are you so concerned about Steve?\"\n Tommy shrugged. \"He got into some trouble the last time he was here. I thought you might have heard about it from your parents.\"\n \"We don\u0027t discuss the past,\" I said, elaborating on the lie I\u0027d concocted. I leant forward curiously. \"What did Steve do?\" I asked, wondering if it was in any way linked to his vampaneze activities.\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t rightly remember,\" Tommy said, shifting uncomfortably - he was lying. \"It\u0027s old history. Best not to bring it up. You know what Steve was like, always in one form of trouble or another.\"\n \"That\u0027s for sure,\" I muttered. Then my eyes narrowed. \"You said you\u0027ve talked to him on the phone?\"\n \"Yeah. He rings every so often, asks what I\u0027m up to, says nothing about what he\u0027s doing, then hangs up!\"\n \"When was the last time he rang?\"\n Tommy thought about it. \"Two, maybe three years ago. A long time.\"\n \"Have you a contact number for him?\"\n \"No.\"\n A shame. I\u0027d thought for a moment that Tommy might be my path back to Steve, but it seemed he wasn\u0027t.\n \"What\u0027s the time?\" Tommy asked. He looked at his watch and groaned. \"If my manager finds out how late I\u0027ve been out, he\u0027ll sack me! Sorry, Darren, but I really have to go.\"\n \"That\u0027s OK,\" I smiled, standing to shake his hand.\n \"Maybe we could meet up again after the match?\"\n \"Yeah!\" Tommy exclaimed. \"I\u0027m not travelling back with the team - I\u0027m staying here for the night, to see some relatives. You can come to the hotel after the game and? Actually, how\u0027d you like to come see me play?\"\n \"At the semi-final?\" My eyes lit up. \"I\u0027d love to. But didn\u0027t I hear you telling Jekkus the tickets were sold out?\"\n \"Jekkus?\" Tommy frowned.\n \"The guy with the knives - your number-one fan.\"\n \"Oh.\" Tommy grimaced. \"I can\u0027t give away tickets to all my fans. But family and friends are a different story.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t be sitting near anyone who knew me, would I?\" I asked. \"I don\u0027t want the truth about me going any further - Annie might hear about it.\"\n \"I\u0027ll get you a seat away from the others,\" Tommy promised. Then he paused. \"You know, Annie\u0027s not a girl any more. I saw her a year ago, the last time I was here for a match. She struck me as being very level-headed. Maybe it\u0027s time to tell her the truth.\"\n \"Maybe,\" I smiled, knowing I wouldn\u0027t.\n \"I really think you should,\" Tommy pressed. \"It would be a shock, like it was for me, but I\u0027m sure she\u0027d be delighted to know you\u0027re alive and well.\"\n \"We\u0027ll see,\" I said.\n I walked Tommy out of the tent, through the campsite and stadium tunnels to where his car was parked. I bid him goodnight at the car, but he stopped before getting in and stared at me seriously. \"We must talk some more about Steve tomorrow,\" he said.\n My heart skipped a beat. \"Why?\" I asked as casually as I could.\n \"There are things you should know. I don\u0027t want to get into them now - it\u0027s too late - but I think?\" He trailed off into silence, then smiled. \"We\u0027ll talk about it tomorrow. It might help you make up your mind about some other things.\"\n And on that cryptic note he said farewell. He promised to send over a ticket in the morning, gave me his hotel name and mobile number, shook my hand one last time, got into his car and drove away.\n I stood outside the walls of the stadium a long while, thinking about Tommy, Annie and the past - and wondering what he\u0027d meant when he said we needed to talk some more about Steve. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-shadows-the-saga-of-darren-shan-11/page-9.html","bookId":2447,"book":{"id":2447,"title":"Lord of the Shadows (The Saga of Darren Shan #11)","description":"Storyline: \n The Saga of Darren Shan #11: Lord of the Shadows \n Lord Of The Shadows is the eleventh book in The Saga of Darren Shan series by the author Darren Shan.
