Cormac was busy and didn\u0027t have time to show the boy how he could re-grow his limbs, but Truska sprouted a short beard for him, then sucked the hairs back into her face. Darius acted like he wasn\u0027t impressed, but I could see the wonder in his eyes.\\n\\n Darius was strange. He didn\u0027t say much, and kept his distance, always a couple of metres away from Harkat and me, as though he still didn\u0027t trust us. He asked lots of questions about the performers and the Cirque Du Freak, which was normal. But he didn\u0027t ask anything about me, where I was from, how I\u0027d come to join the show or what my tasks involved. He didn\u0027t ask about Harkat either. The grey-skinned, stitched-together Little Person was like nothing most people had ever seen. It was common for newcomers to pump him for information. But Darius seemed uninterested in Harkat, as if he already knew everything about him.\\n\\n He also had a way of staring at me oddly. I\u0027d catch him looking at me, when he thought my attention was elsewhere. It wasn\u0027t a threatening look. There was just something about the flickering of his eyes that for some reason unsettled me.\\n\\n Harkat and I weren\u0027t hungry, but when we passed one of the open campfires and saw a pot of bubbling soup, I heard Darius\u0027s stomach rumble. \"Want to eat?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m having dinner when I go home,\" he said.\\n\\n \"How about a snack, to keep you going?\"\\n\\n He hesitated, then licked his lips and nodded quickly. \"But just a small bowl of soup,\" he snapped, as though we meant to force-feed him.\\n\\n While Darius was downing the soup, Harkat asked if he lived nearby.\\n\\n \"Not far off,\" he answered vaguely.\\n\\n \"How did you find out? about the show?\"\\n\\n Darius didn\u0027t look up. \"A friend of mine - Oggy Bas - was here. He was going to take some seats - we often come here when we want seats or railings. It\u0027s easy to get in and nobody cares what we take. He saw the circus tent and told me. I thought it was an ordinary circus until I came exploring yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"What sort of a name is Oggy Bas?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Oggy\u0027s short for Augustine,\" Darius explained.\\n\\n \"Did you tell Oggy what the Cirque Du? Freak really was?\" Harkat asked.\\n\\n \"Nah,\" Darius said. \"He\u0027s got a big mouth. He\u0027d tell everybody and they\u0027d all come. I like being the only one who knows about it.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re a boy who knows how to keep a secret,\" I chuckled. \"Of course, the downside is that since nobody knows you\u0027re here, if wedid kidnap you or feed you to the Wolf Man, nobody would know where to look.\"\\n\\n I was joking, but Darius reacted sharply. He half-bolted to his feet, dropping the unfinished bowl of soup. Acting instinctively, I snatched for the bowl, and with my vampire speed I caught it before it hit the ground. But Darius thought I meant to strike him. He threw himself backwards and roared, \"Leave me alone!\"\\n\\n I took a surprised step back. The other people around the fire were gawping at us. Harkat\u0027s green eyes were on Darius, and there was more than just surprise in his expression - he looked wary too.\\n\\n \"Easy,\" I half-laughed, lowering the bowl, then raising my hands in a gesture of friendship. \"I\u0027m not going to hurt you.\"\\n\\n Darius sat up. He was blushing angrily. \"I\u0027m OK,\" he mumbled, getting to his feet.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong, Darius?\" Harkat asked quietly. \"Why so edgy?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m OK,\" Darius said again, glaring at Harkat. \"I just don\u0027t like people saying stuff like that. It\u0027s not funny, creatures like you making threats like that.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean it,\" I said, ashamed for having frightened the boy. \"How about I get a ticket to tonight\u0027s show for you, to make up for scaring you?\"\\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t scared,\" Darius growled.\\n\\n \"Of course you aren\u0027t,\" I smiled. \"But would you like a ticket anyway?\"\\n\\n Darius pulled a face. \"How much are they?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s free,\" I said. \"Courtesy of the house.\"\\n\\n \"OK then.\" That was as close as Darius got to saying thanks.\\n\\n \"Would you like one for Oggy too?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"No,\" Darius said. \"He wouldn\u0027t come. He\u0027s a scaredy cat. He doesn\u0027t even watch horror movies, not even the really old and boring ones.\"\\n\\n \"Fair enough,\" I said. \"Wait here. I\u0027ll be back in a couple of minutes.\"\\n\\n I tracked down Mr Tall. When I told him what I wanted, he frowned and said all the tickets for tonight\u0027s show had been sold. \"But surely you can find a spare one somewhere,\" I laughed. There was always lots of space in the aisles and it was usually never a problem to stick in a few extra chairs.\\n\\n \"Is it wise, inviting a child to the show?\" Mr Tall asked. \"Children tend to fare unfavourably here. Yourself, Steve Leonard, Sam Grest.\" Sam was a boy who\u0027d had a fatal run-in with the Wolf Man. He was the first person I\u0027d drunk blood from. Part of his spirit - not to mention his taste for pickled onions! - still lived on within me.\\n\\n \"Why mention Sam?\" I asked, confused. I couldn\u0027t remember the last time Mr Tall had made a reference to my long-dead friend.\\n\\n \"No reason in particular,\" Mr Tall said. \"I just think this is a dangerous place for children.\" Then he produced a ticket out of thin air and handed it to me. \"Give it to the boy if you wish,\" he grumbled, as if I\u0027d squeezed an inconvenient favour out of him.\\n\\n I walked back slowly to Darius and Harkat, wondering why Mr Tall had behaved in such a curious manner. Had he been trying to warn me not to let Darius get too closely involved with the Cirque Du Freak? Was Darius like Sam Grest, eager to leave home and travel around with a band of magical performers? By inviting him to the show, was I setting him up for a fall like Sam\u0027s?\\n\\n I found Darius standing where I\u0027d left him. He didn\u0027t look like he\u0027d moved a muscle. Harkat was on the other side of the fire, keeping a green eye on the boy. I hesitated before giving Darius his ticket. \"What do you think of the Cirque Du Freak?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s OK,\" he shrugged.\\n\\n \"How would you feel about joining?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"If there was an opening, and you had the chance to leave home, would?\"\\n\\n \"No way!\" he snapped before I finished.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re happy at home?\" Yes.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want to travel around the world?\"\\n\\n \"Not with you lot.\"\\n\\n I smiled and gave him the ticket. \"That\u0027s OK then. The show starts at ten. Will you be able to come?\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Darius said, pocketing the ticket without looking at it.\\n\\n \"What about your parents?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go to bed early, then sneak out,\" he said, and giggled slyly.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re caught, don\u0027t tell them about us,\" I warned him.\\n\\n \"As if!\" he snorted, then waved sharply and left. He looked at me one final time before he passed out of sight, and again there was something odd about his gaze.\\n\\n Harkat walked around the fire and stared after the boy.\\n\\n \"A strange kid,\" I commented.\\n\\n \"More than just strange,\" Harkat murmured.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like him,\" Harkat said.\\n\\n \"He was a bit sullen,\" I agreed, \"but lots of kids his age are like that. I was that way myself when I first joined the Cirque Du Freak.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Harkat\u0027s eyes were full of doubt. \"I didn\u0027t buy his story about his? friend, Oggy. If he\u0027s such a scaredy cat, what was he? doing exploring up here by himself?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re getting suspicious in your old age,\" I laughed.\\n\\n Harkat shook his head slowly. \"You didn\u0027t pick up on it.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" I frowned.\\n\\n \"When he accused us of threatening him, he said? \u0027creatures like you\u0027.\" So?\\n\\n Harkat smiled thinly. \"I\u0027m quite obviouslynot human. But what tipped him off to the fact? thatyou aren\u0027t either?\"\\n\\n A sudden chill ran through me. Harkat was right - the boy had known more about us than he should have. And I realized now what it was about Darius\u0027s gaze which had disturbed me. When he thought I wasn\u0027t looking, his eyes kept going to the scars on my fingertips, the standard marks of a vampire - like he knew what they meant! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-shadows-the-saga-of-darren-shan-11/page-7.html","bookId":2447,"book":{"id":2447,"title":"Lord of the Shadows (The Saga of Darren Shan #11)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #11: Lord of the Shadows \\n Lord Of The Shadows is the eleventh book in The Saga of Darren Shan series by the author Darren Shan.
