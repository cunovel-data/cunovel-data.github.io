I sat by myself in a seat high up in the football stadium while the show was in progress, thinking about Annie and her child, Mum and Dad, all that I\u0027d lost and missed out on. For the first time in years I felt angry with Mr Crepsley for blooding me. I found myself wondering what life would be like if he\u0027d left me alone, wishing I could go back and change the past.\\n\\n But there was no point tormenting myself. The past was a closed book. I could do nothing to alter it, and wasn\u0027t even sure I would if I could - if I hadn\u0027t been blooded, I wouldn\u0027t have been able to tip the vampires off about Kurda Smahlt, and the entire clan might have fallen.\\n\\n If I\u0027d returned home ten or twelve years earlier, my feelings of loss and anger might have been stronger. But I was an adult now, in all but looks. A Vampire Prince. I\u0027d learnt to deal with heartache. That wasn\u0027t an easy night. Tears flowed freely. But by the time I drifted off to sleep a few hours before dawn, I\u0027d resigned myself to the situation, and knew there would be no fresh tears in the morning.\\n\\n I was stiff with the cold when I awoke, but worked it off by jogging down the tiers of the stadium to where the Cirque was camped. As I was making for the tent I shared with Harkat, I spotted Mr Tall. He was standing by an open fire, roasting sausages on a spit. He beckoned me over and threw a handful of sausages to me, then speared a fresh batch and stuck them over the flames.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I said, eagerly munching the piping-hot sausages.\\n\\n \"I knew you would be hungry,\" he replied. He looked at me steadily. \"You have been to see your sister.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" It didn\u0027t surprise me that he knew. Mr Tall was an insightful old owl.\\n\\n \"Did she see you?\" Mr Tall asked.\\n\\n \"She saw me briefly, but I left before she got a good look.\"\\n\\n \"You behaved correctly.\" He turned the sausages over and spoke softly. \"You are about to ask me if I will help protect your sister. You fear for her safety.\"\\n\\n \"Harkat thinks something\u0027s going to happen,\" I said. \"He\u0027s not sure what, but if Steve Leopard\u0027s part of it, he might use Annie to hurt me.\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t,\" Mr Tall said. I was surprised by his directness - normally he was very cagey when it came to revealing anything about the future. \"As long as you stay out of her life, your sister will be under no direct threat.\"\\n\\n \"What aboutin direct threat?\" I asked warily.\\n\\n Mr Tall chuckled. \"We are all under indirect threat, one way or another. Harkat is correct - this is a time and place of destiny. I can say no more about it, except leave your sister alone. She is safe that way.\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" I sighed. I wasn\u0027t happy about leaving Annie to fend for herself, but I trusted Hibernius Tall.\\n\\n \"You should sleep some more now,\" Mr Tall said. \"You are tired.\"\\n\\n That sounded like a good plan. I scoffed another sausage, turned to leave, then stopped. \"Hibernius,\" I said without facing him, \"I know you can\u0027t tell me what\u0027s going to happen, but before we came here, you said I didn\u0027t have to come. It would have been better if I\u0027d stayed away, wouldn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n There was a long silence. I didn\u0027t think he was going to respond. But then, softly, he said, \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"What if I left now?\"\\n\\n \"It is too late,\" Mr Tall said. \"Your decision to return set a train of events in motion. That train cannot be derailed. If you left now, it would only serve the purpose of the forces you oppose.\"\\n\\n \"But what if?\" I said, turning to push the issue. But Mr Tall had disappeared, leaving only the flickering flames and a stick speared with sausages lying on the grass next to the fire.\\n\\n That evening, after I\u0027d rested and enjoyed a filling meal, I told Harkat about my trip home. I also told him about my short conversation with Mr Tall and how he\u0027d urged me not to get involved with Annie.\\n\\n \"Then you were right,\" Harkat grunted. \"I thought you should involve yourself with? your family again, but it seems I was wrong.\"\\n\\n We were feeding scraps of meat to the Wolf Man, part of our daily chores. We stood at a safe distance from his cage, all too aware of the power of his fearsome jaws.\\n\\n \"What about your nephew?\" Harkat asked. \"Any family resemblance?\"\\n\\n I paused, a large sliver of meat in my right hand. \"It\u0027s strange, but I didn\u0027t think of him as that until now. I just thought of him as Annie\u0027s son. I forgot that also makes him my nephew.\" I grinned crookedly. \"I\u0027m an uncle!\"\\n\\n \"Congratulations,\" Harkat deadpanned. \"Did he look like you?\"\\n\\n \"Not really,\" I said. I thought of the fair-haired, chubby boy\u0027s smile, and how he\u0027d helped Annie bring in the washing. \"A nice kid, from what I saw. Handsome, of course, like all the Shans.\"\\n\\n \"Of course!\" Harkat snorted.\\n\\n I was sorry I hadn\u0027t taken more notice of Annie\u0027s boy. I didn\u0027t even know his name. I thought about going back to ask about him - I could hang about and collar Bridget the gossip again - but dismissed the idea immediately. That was precisely the kind of stunt which could backfire and bring me to Annie\u0027s notice. Best to forget about him.\\n\\n As we were finishing off, I saw a young boy watching us from behind a nearby van. He was studying us quietly, taking care not to attract attention. In the normal run of things, I\u0027d have ignored him - children often came nosing around the Cirque site. But my thoughts were on my nephew and I found myself more interested in the boy than I\u0027d otherwise have been.\\n\\n \"Hello!\" I shouted, waving at him. The boy\u0027s head instantly vanished behind the van. I would have left it, but moments later the boy stepped out and walked towards us. He looked nervous - understandable, since we were in the presence of the snarling Wolf Man - but he was fighting hard not to show it.\\n\\n The boy stopped a few metres away and nodded curtly. \"Hello,\" he mumbled. He was scrawny. He had dark blond hair and bright blue eyes. I put his age at somewhere in the region of ten or eleven, maybe a little bit older than Annie\u0027s kid, though there couldn\u0027t have been much of an age difference. For all I knew they might even be going to school together!\\n\\n The boy said nothing after greeting us. I was thinking about my nephew and comparing this boy to him, so I said nothing either. Harkat finally broke the silence. \"Hi,\" he said, lowering the mask he wore to filter out air, which was poisonous to him. \"I\u0027m Harkat.\"\\n\\n \"Darius,\" the boy said, nodding at Harkat, not offering to shake hands.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m Darren,\" I smiled.\\n\\n \"You two are with the freak show,\" Darius said. \"I saw you yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been here before?\" Harkat asked.\\n\\n \"A couple of times. I\u0027ve never seen a freak show before. I tried buying a ticket but nobody will sell me one. I asked the tall guy - he\u0027s the owner, isn\u0027t he? - but he said it wasn\u0027t suitable for children.\"\\n\\n \"It is a bit on the gruesome side,\" I said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why I want to see it,\" he grunted.\\n\\n I laughed, remembering what I\u0027d been like at his age. \"Tell you what,\" I said. \"Why don\u0027t you walk around with us? We can show you some of the performers and tell you about the show. If you still want a ticket, maybe we can sort one out for you then.\"\\n\\n Darius squinted at me suspiciously, then at Harkat. \"How do I know I can trust you?\" he asked. \"You might be a pair of kidnappers.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you have my word we won\u0027t? kidnap you,\" Harkat purred, treating Darius to his widest grin, displaying his grey tongue and sharp, pointed teeth. \"We might feed you to the Wolf Man? but we won\u0027t kidnap you.\"\\n\\n Darius yawned to show he wasn\u0027t impressed by the theatrical threat, then said, \"What the hell, I\u0027ve nothing better to do.\" Then he tapped his foot and raised an eyebrow impatiently. \"Come on!\" he snapped. \"I\u0027m ready!\"\\n\\n \"Yes, master,\" I laughed, and led the harmless-looking boy on a tour of the Cirque. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-shadows-the-saga-of-darren-shan-11/page-6.html","bookId":2447,"book":{"id":2447,"title":"Lord of the Shadows (The Saga of Darren Shan #11)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #11: Lord of the Shadows \\n Lord Of The Shadows is the eleventh book in The Saga of Darren Shan series by the author Darren Shan.
