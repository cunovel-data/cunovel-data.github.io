But he\u0027s convinced the rest of the treasure is still buried here somewhere.\"\n \"And so are you,\" Verity concluded quietly. She looked down at the crystal. \"Do you believe in curses, Jonas?\"\n \"No, but I have great respect for the intricate workings of the Renaissance mind. And a psychic Renaissance mind boggles the imagination. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a curse on the treasure but I do believe that someone has locked it up very carefully. Hazelhurst believed that crystal was the key, and I think he might have been right.\"\n Verity looked at him, her expression unreadable. \"You\u0027re going to try it, aren\u0027t you? Sooner or later, you\u0027re going to try to unlock that frozen vision.\"\n \"If I don\u0027t, I\u0027ll probably wind up as nutty as Hazelhurst or as insane as Spencer,\" Jonas said harshly. \"I have to know the truth about it, Verity.\"\n She nodded. \"Yes. I can see that.\" She carefully repocketed the crystal. \"When the time comes you\u0027ll need my help.\"\n Jonas was startled. \"What makes you say that?\" he demanded as she started to turn away.\n She glanced back, her mouth softening slightly. \"I can tune this crystal to the one on the desk in the vision.\"\n He took a long stride forward and caught her by the arms. \"Verity? What are you saying? Are you sure?\"\n \"Unfortunately, yes. I\u0027m fairly certain I can do it. Don\u0027t ask me how, Jonas. I really don\u0027t understand it myself. And if you want my professional opinion as your business manager, I suggest we forget the whole project. But I know you don\u0027t want my professional opinion.\" She turned away again and went into the bathroom to wash the dirt and blood off her hands.\n After a little fiddling with a screwdriver he\u0027d located in the kitchen, Jonas managed to open the torture-chamber entrance. Spencer had been too panicked to do a thorough job of jamming the mechanism.\n Inside the passageway Maggie was still unconscious. Jonas managed to get her upstairs to the salon, where he put her on the couch. She didn\u0027t awaken but her breathing seemed steady and the bleeding had stopped. Verity left her tucked under a quilt and went outside with Jonas to retrieve Slade Spencer. They locked him in a spare storage room.\n \"What are we going to do with him?\" Verity asked as she followed Jonas upstairs.\n \"There\u0027s nothing we can do until Warwick and Crump get back with the launch. We\u0027re sure as hell not going to try to get off this island in that little skiff Spencer rented. In the meantime, I want to see if we can find those missing diary pages in Spencer\u0027s things. He may have kept them.\"\n \"Doug and Oliver might not be able to get back here for hours,\" Verity remarked as they walked down the hall toward the room Spencer had used.\n \"True.\"\n \"We\u0027d better wake Yarwood and tell him what\u0027s going on. To think that all this time we wrongly suspected him of being up to no good,\" Verity said, chagrined. \"I suppose it must have been Spencer who pushed Elyssa off the cliff. Maybe he thought she was getting suspicious about the boat.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" Jonas said thoughtfully. \"You mentioned finding the boat earlier and he never made an attempt on your life.\"\n \"He didn\u0027t make an attempt on my life then, but he tried to do something nasty to me before that,\" Verity stated quietly.\n Jonas\u0027s head snapped around abruptly, his eyes fierce. \"What? He tried to hurt you? When?\"\n \"That night we stayed in the bed-and-breakfast inn.\"\n \"The joker who tried to grab you outside the bathroom?\" Jonas asked in amazement. \"It was him?\n You\u0027re sure?\"\n \"I recognized the tobacco he uses. I just caught a whiff of it on his sweater that night, not enough to make a real impression. I didn\u0027t recognize it when he was smoking his pipe around here because the odor was so much stronger thenâ€”it overpowers you. But when I caught a trace of it again in the torture chamber, I knew it was the same tobacco. No one else smokes around here except Spencer.\"\n Jonas started back down the hall, his fury reignited. \"I\u0027ll kill him.\"\n Verity grabbed his arm. \"No, wait, Jonas. There\u0027s no need for that. He\u0027s already under lock and key.\"\n \"I should have strangled him the night he made a pass at you.\" He shook off her hand.\n Verity made another grab for him and caught hold of his sleeve. \"Jonas, stop it. Listen to me. Everything is under control, there\u0027s no need for any more violence. Lord knows there\u0027s been enough in this place.\n Let\u0027s go wake Yarwood and tell him what\u0027s going on. He\u0027s got a right to know.\"\n A door creaked. Verity and Jonas both turned.\n \"I\u0027m glad you feel that way, Verity.\" Preston Yarwood stood in the doorway of his bedroom. \"I would very much like to know exactly what is going on. And when you\u0027ve finished telling me, we\u0027ll all go searching for Hazelhurst\u0027s missing treasure. But when we find it, I\u0027m afraid there will be a slight change of plans. You see, too many psychic treasure hunters spoil the image.\"\n \"What the hell do you think you\u0027re doing, Yarwood?\" Jonas asked softly.\n \"I\u0027ve decided we don\u0027t need your name attached to this particular find, my friend. You\u0027re a fraud, you see. I\u0027m the one with real psychic talent around here, and finding the treasure is going to prove that once and for all. This is my project, and I\u0027m the one who\u0027s going to get the credit. When this is all over, people will be forced to admit that I\u0027ve got psychic power. And with you and Verity mysteriously gone, there won\u0027t be anyone left alive to tell them differently.\"\n Verity stared in shock at Preston Yarwood\u0027s face for a long time before her eyes dropped to the gun in his hand.\n Chapter Seventeen\n Jonas contemplated the gun in Preston Yarwood\u0027s hand. The man looked as though he knew exactly what he was doing with it. The report says he\u0027s dangerous, Caitlin Evanger had said.\n \"There\u0027s no treasure, Yarwood.\" Jonas edged a few steps away from Verity, making it more difficult for Yarwood to keep both of them covered with the weapon.\n \"Don\u0027t try to bullshit me, Quarrel,\" Yarwood said genially. \"The treasure is here, I know it. I\u0027ve had a psychic premonition of it all along.\"\n \"Talk about bullshit,\" Jonas muttered. \"You\u0027ve just got treasure fever.\"\n \"I know it\u0027s here,\" Preston snapped. \"I had sections of Hazelhurst\u0027s diary translated, you see. Not all of it, but enough to know he was onto something. It\u0027s here, I tell you. And I\u0027ve heard enough this morning to convince me you\u0027re close to the answer. So you\u0027re going to take me with you when you unlock the secret.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-71.html","bookId":1796,"book":{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: \n HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO.
