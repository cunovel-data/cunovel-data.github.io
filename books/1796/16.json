She cocked a brow as she glanced back over her plump shoulder. \"Is it true what Little Miss Sunshine down there says? You some kinda weirdo psychic?\"\n \"No, ma\u0027am,\" Jonas said blandly. \"I am definitely not some kinda weirdo psychic.\"\n \"Good. We got enough nuts in this place right now as it is, don\u0027t need another one running around.\n Taking orders from Little Miss Sunshine is bad enough. Don\u0027t know what Digby woulda thought of all this, just don\u0027t know.\"\n \"Little Miss Sunshine?\" Verity repeated curiously.\n \"The Warwick girl. I call her Little Miss Sunshine \u0027cause she\u0027s always smiling and saying how the whole universe is workin\u0027 together just to make her life perfect. That kind of cheerfulness just ain\u0027t natural, if you ask me. Course, I don\u0027t hold much with this hocus-pocus malarkey or the kind of folks who get involved with it. Ain\u0027t nothing new about it anyway. We had the same type of kook around when I was a kid, but at least most of \u0027em had the decency to work in a circus or at the county fair.\"\n \"I\u0027m with you, Maggie,\" Jonas said. \"What did Digby Hazelhurst think about all this psychic stuff?\"\n Maggie resumed climbing the staircase. \"Old Digby was just fine up until about two years before he died. Then he started turnin\u0027 a mite weird, I\u0027ll grant you that much. But the man was in his eighties. Had a right to be a bit touched, I say. Besides, it didn\u0027t affect us one way or the other.\"\n \"Us?\" Verity asked quickly.\n \"Him and me,\" Maggie explained with a wistful chuckle. \"Digby and me used to have some good times together. We spent more years than I want to count stuck here on this island with only each other for company, and we weren\u0027t neither one of us bored. I\u0027ll tell you, when it came to certain types of activity, that old man had the energy of a high school senior in the backseat of a car. Had us some rare old times down in the torture chamber. My, my, yes, we did.\" Maggie reached the top of the staircase and trudged down a dim corridor.\n Verity shot a highly amused glance at Jonas, who leered back comically.\n Maggie opened the heavy wooden door of a room halfway down the corridor, revealing a large suite with huge, arched windows. A wide, canopied bed occupied the center of the room. The cold stone walls were hung with a faded tapestry and a couple of grime-encrusted paintings. The stone floor was bare.\n \"This do for ya?\" Maggie asked expectantly. \" \u0027Fraid it\u0027s the best I\u0027ve got to offer. Used to have a lot of nice furniture in most of the rooms in this wing, but Digby had to sell the stuff off to keep going.\n Bathroom\u0027s off to the right there. At least old Digby had the sense to put in plumbing when he inherited the villa. I wouldn\u0027t have stayed with him all those years if I\u0027d had to use a chamber pot, I can tell you.\"\n \"This is fine,\" Verity said. The end of her cane rang loudly on the stone floor as she walked to one of the windows. She leaned out, expecting a view of lush gardens.\n What she saw was a large courtyard overgrown with weeds. There was a fountain in the center, but no water poured from the jug held by the naked nymph carved on top of the circular monstrosity. Dead pine needles and dirt littered the empty pool.\n \"See you folks later. Holler if you need anything,\" Maggie said, closing the door behind her.\n Verity turned from the window to watch Jonas prowl the room. \"Everything okay?\" she asked softly, although she was almost certain it was. She would know if any strong force in the room was affecting him.\n \"Yeah.\" Jonas paused beside the threadbare tapestry and studied it without touching it. It was just barely possible to make out a scene of Renaissance maidens cavorting in a leafy bower. \"Everything\u0027s fine. The bed\u0027s new, incidentally.\"\n Verity glanced at the big bed. \"Just as well. I wasn\u0027t looking forward to sleeping in a four-hundred-year-old bed.\"\n \"The tapestry\u0027s sixteenth-century, though. Can you believe it? It\u0027s just been hanging here, decaying all these years.\" Jonas shook his head and wandered over to one of the ornately framed pictures. \"Same with the paintings.\"\n Verity caught her breath. \"They\u0027re originals?\"\n He nodded. \"This one is. It would be interesting to see what\u0027s under all that grime. I have a hunch that the artist was just as second-rate as the architect who designed the villa.\"\n Verity leaned back against the wide window ledge, folded her arms, and eyed Jonas closely. \"You\u0027re not going to have any trouble sleeping here?\"\n \"No. I\u0027m fine, Verity. Everything\u0027s under control. I can sense a few faint vibrations, but unless I deliberately open up to them, they won\u0027t bother me. What a relief.\"\n \"That\u0027s one of the reasons you took this job, isn\u0027t it?\" Verity asked suddenly. \"You wanted to see how much control you\u0027ve really gained over the past few months.\"\n Jonas glanced at her as he walked across the room to open his duffel bag. \"I\u0027m a lot stronger now, Verity. I\u0027m in control. You don\u0027t know how good it feels. And I owe it all to you. Just being around you seems to have strengthened my power to keep from being swept into that time tunnel. I couldn\u0027t have slept inside a genuine Renaissance villa before I met you. The vibrations locked in the walls alone would have overwhelmed me. Christ, it feels good to be able to manage this damn talent of mine.\"\n \"You\u0027re determined not to admit to Little Miss Sunshine and her pals that you\u0027re a genuine grade-A psychic?\"\n \"I am not a psychic,\" Jonas stated forcefully. \"I have a talent for psychometry, but I\u0027m not clairvoyant. I don\u0027t have visions. I don\u0027t see the future or predict disasters. The only thing I can do is pick up certain scenes from the past.\"\n \"Scenes of violence.\"\n \"A very limited talent,\" Jonas pointed out dryly. \"I\u0027m sure as hell no psychic. And I would appreciate it if you would refrain from implying otherwise to Elyssa and her friends.\"\n Verity grinned. \"I don\u0027t know, Jonas. There might be more money in this consulting business if we let people know that you have a genuine talent.\"\n \"Not a chance. Normal, rational people wouldn\u0027t believe in my abilities and they damn well wouldn\u0027t want to pay for my services. Only eccentric weirdos would be willing to pay the consulting fees of someone claiming to have a psychic talent. Doug Warwick hired me as a Renaissance scholar, not a New Age nut.\"\n \"And instead he\u0027s getting both,\" Verity murmured happily.\n Jonas scowled. \"There\u0027s nothing New Age about me or my talent.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-16.html","bookId":1796,"book":{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: \n HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO.
