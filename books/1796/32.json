Then he glanced up at the crystal she was holding. \"Why are you stroking it like that?\" he asked abruptly. Verity glanced down at the crystal in surprise and realized she was rubbing it with her index finger. \"I don\u0027t know. Just fiddling around, I guess.\" Oliver touched the crystal and frowned. He started to move his finger on it. Verity frowned. Something wasn\u0027t right. \"No, not like that.\" She concentrated for a moment, then slowly moved her hand to guide Oliver\u0027s finger. Immediately things felt sharper and clearer—more tuned. \"That\u0027s it,\" she whispered. \"Doesn\u0027t that feel better?\" \"Yes. Much better.\" Oliver stroked the crystal for a long time under the guidance of her fingers. Then his eyes met hers. \"You are, you know,\" he announced calmly. Verity flinched. \"I am what?\" she asked carefully. \"Pregnant.\" He stopped touching the crystal and deftly pinned the compress in place. Verity\u0027s fingers closed violently around the crystal. \"How do you know?\" she demanded, her voice taut. Crump shrugged and took the crystal from her hand. \"Some things are obvious. You showed me the truth just now, when you touched the crystal. I could sense it.\" He put the translucent crystal into his pocket again. \"How\u0027s the ankle feel?\" She looked down at her foot, realizing suddenly that her ankle was already feeling less painful. \"Better. A lot better. Thank you, Oliver.\" \"Are you going to tell Quarrel soon?\" Disconcerted, Verity raised her eyes to meet Crump\u0027s serious, dark gaze. \"I\u0027ll tell him soon. If it\u0027s true.\" \"It\u0027s true. And the sooner you tell Quarrel, the better. He needs to know.\" \"Why?\" \"Because he needs to be reassured that he\u0027s got a secure place in your life. He\u0027s never had much in the way of security.\" \"Maybe he won\u0027t want to be a father,\" she said in a low, urgent tone. \"Some men aren\u0027t cut out to be fathers.\" \"Quarrel isn\u0027t \u0027some men.\u0027 He\u0027s Quarrel. And he\u0027s permanently linked to you somehow. I don\u0027t understand it completely, but I can sense it. Tell him about the baby soon.\" Crump rose to his feet, gathered up his supplies, and walked out of the room without another word. Verity stared after him for a long while. As lunchtime approached, Verity decided that her ankle was feeling considerably better. She removed the compress, picked up her cane, and headed for the kitchen to give Maggie a hand with the meal. She wasn\u0027t accustomed to such a crowd. Maggie was grateful for her assistance. After checking the pantry, Verity put together a creditable salad and some herbed cream-cheese sandwiches. When the treasure-hunting party returned, they were hungry. \"By the way,\" Jonas told Verity as he wolfed down his third sandwich. \"You and I are going to borrow the launch and run over to that little town on the other island. The one we came through on the way here. I need to make some phone calls.\" \"Why?\" she asked blankly. \"Research,\" he explained as if it were obvious. \"Unfortunately, Digby never got around to installing a phone. Better pack a few things. We\u0027ll stay overnight and come back in the morning.\" \"Are you sure you don\u0027t want me to come with you?\" Elyssa asked with a sympathetic glance at Verity. \"Poor Verity really should keep off that ankle.\" \"Actually,\" replied Verity, \"my ankle is feeling a great deal better.\" She was not about to offer her seat on the launch to Elyssa Warwick. Sunshine and enlightenment were becoming distinctly tiresome. Preston Yarwood recognized that expression in Elyssa\u0027s eyes. He went into the salon after lunch, poured himself a drink, and thought about it. The dumb little bitch had the hots for Quarrel, that much was obvious. Elyssa was ready to roll over for anything in pants, as long as the guy claimed to have psychic powers. Yarwood figured that he ought to know—she\u0027d certainly rolled over fast enough for him. And there was no denying that she was a hot little number in bed. No one had ever gone down on him the way Elyssa did. When she screwed him she really put everything into it; she treated the whole thing as a spiritual experience. She was definitely the best lay Yarwood had ever had, and he\u0027d gotten accustomed to that look of adoration in her eyes. It was infuriating to see her panting after Jonas Quarrel now, but there wasn\u0027t much he could do about it just yet. Yarwood needed Quarrel for the moment, but they were natural enemies. When this was all over, Yarwood would show them all who the real psychic was. Then it would be amusing to watch Elyssa beg him to screw her silly. Chapter Eight \"Are you going to tell me what this little jaunt is really about, or do I get to play twenty questions?\" Verity stepped off the launch, using her cane to balance herself on the floating dock marina. She realized that her ankle wasn\u0027t nearly as sore as it had been that morning. \"And where did you learn to drive a boat, anyway?\" \"You don\u0027t drive a boat, Verity, you pilot it. And I don\u0027t remember where I learned. You work enough waterfront dives on enough islands and sooner or later you get the urge to learn how to get off the island alone, should the occasion arise. A simple safety precaution.\" Jonas finished making the lines fast and reached into the stern for his bulging duffel bag. Verity wrinkled her nose. \"Did you ever have to leave on the lam?\" \"Not that I can recall,\" he retorted dryly. \"I told you, learning to use a boat was just a safety precaution.\" \"Like learning to use a knife, I suppose?\" Jonas grimaced as he heaved the heavy duffel out of the launch. He didn\u0027t bother to respond to her last remark. \"Hell, Verity, what have you got in here? \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 you said, \u0027there\u0027s no need to bring two bags, there\u0027s plenty of room in your duffel for my nightie and blow dryer.\u0027 Where did you come up with a ninety-pound blow dryer?\" \"Quit complaining. It\u0027s not that heavy and you know it. Of course I had to leave a few of your things behind to make room for my stuff, but you won\u0027t miss them overnight.\" \"What things of mine did you leave behind?\" He looked ominous as he strode up the dock beside her. \"Just one or two small items,\" she assured him cheerily. \"Don\u0027t worry about it. Now about this little trip to civilization.\" She gazed at the sleepy town overlooking the tiny harbor. \"Did we really have to come all this way just to use the phone?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-32.html","bookId":1796,"book":{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO.
