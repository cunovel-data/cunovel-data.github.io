With a cake and a fancy dress and everyone in Sequence Springs in the church.\"\\n\\n \"I should have known.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll be fun,\" Verity assured him, her enthusiasm rapidly growing as she envisioned the details. \"It\u0027ll also be the only chance I ever get to wear a beautiful formal wedding gown.\"\\n\\n \"Verity, up until quite recently, you never even planned to get married at all. Why the sudden interest in cakes and wedding gowns?\" Jonas complained.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve changed my mind about a lot of things lately. If I\u0027m going to get married, I want to do it right,\" she stated stubbornly.\\n\\n \"Honey, it takes time to organize a big wedding,\" Jonas argued reasonably. He put a possessive palm on her belly. \"And time is something we haven\u0027t got.\"\\n\\n \"Laura can help me. It won\u0027t take long at all to get things organized. And it\u0027s not like we have to keep the baby a secret. Everyone in Sequence Springs is going to know I\u0027m pregnant as soon as I make an appointment with my doctor.\"\\n\\n Jonas sighed heavily. \"I really don\u0027t think we need to go through all this.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s what I want, Jonas.\"\\n\\n \"Stubborn little tyrant.\" He rolled onto his side and reached for her. \"The things I do for you, lady.\" He dropped a warm, hungry kiss on the pulse point of her throat.\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t really mind, will you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll survive. And I understand it\u0027s important to humor pregnant ladies.\" He moved his mouth slowly, teasingly down to the valley between her br**sts.\\n\\n \"Thank you, Jonas.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t thank me. Just be prepared to get out of the wedding dress and into your black lace nightie right after we cut the cake.\"\\n\\n Verity giggled, feeling suddenly euphoric. \"I love you, Jonas.\"\\n\\n \"Love you, too, tyrant. And I\u0027ve just given you the ultimate proof. If I didn\u0027t love you to distraction, I sure as hell wouldn\u0027t put up with the nonsense of a big wedding.\" His tongue was suddenly hot and wet in the small depression that dimpled her stomach. His fingers slid between her thighs.\\n\\n Verity shivered with pleasure and turned her head so that she could kiss the scar that marked the strong curve of his shoulder. She and the baby would be safe with this man. He would protect them and care for them. She knew that now with deep certainty.\\n\\n Jonas was now bound to her as surely as she was bound to him.\\n\\n It was nearly dawn when Verity awoke. Not that a person would know it by looking out the window, she thought as she turned her head on the pillow. It was pitch black outside. The storm had arrived in a flurry of rain and wild wind.\\n\\n \"Doug and Oliver won\u0027t be able to get back here until this lets up,\" Jonas observed as he stretched and sat up on the edge of the bed. \"Could be hours before they can return. Maybe a full day.\"\\n\\n Verity watched him as he moved about in the shadows. She knew what was going through his mind.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to spend every spare minute hunting for that treasure, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Damn right.\" He shrugged into a denim shirt and reached for his jeans. \"But first I want to take another look at the boat in the cove.\"\\n\\n \"Jonas, it\u0027s dark outside. You won\u0027t be able to see a thing.\"\\n\\n He glanced at his watch. \"Should be getting light by the time I get there.\" He disappeared into the bathroom for a few moments. When he returned he came toward the bed. He bent over and caged Verity between his arms, his eyes intense in the shadows. \"You stay in here until I get back. I don\u0027t want you wandering around this place without me.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t really think Yarwood would try to hurt me, do you?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what to think. Everything in this joint is crazy. So you\u0027re to stay put until I return.\" He gave her a quick, hard kiss. \"Don\u0027t worry. This shouldn\u0027t take long. I\u0027ll be back in plenty of time for breakfast.\\n\\n Nobody will even know I\u0027m gone.\" He straightened and grabbed his new jacket.\\n\\n Verity sat bolt upright. \"You\u0027ll ruin that coat in this rain.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell good is a jacket you can\u0027t wear in the rain?\"\\n\\n He reached into his duffel bag and pulled out his knife. He tried to be subtle about it, but Verity saw what was happening. She bit her lip and said nothing. In truth, she was rather glad he was not going out into that wild storm unarmed.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t think whoever owns that boat will still be there, do you? Nobody in his right mind would be camping out there in this storm.\"\\n\\n \"On the whole, I\u0027m inclined to agree with you on that last part. Which brings up some interesting possibilities.\"\\n\\n \"Such as?\"\\n\\n \"Such as maybe whoever owns that boat is staying right here in this villa. There\u0027s plenty of room around here. A man could hide out for days in this monstrosity. Even if you knew he was there and you went looking for him, it would be hard to find him.\"\\n\\n Verity\u0027s mouth fell open. \"Good grief. I never thought of that. You\u0027re right. He could hide in one of the other wings and stay hidden for as long as he wanted. Be careful, Jonas.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be careful.\" He started for the door. \"Get some more sleep. I\u0027ll be back soon.\"\\n\\n \"Sleep? Are you kidding? Now that you\u0027ve told me you think some weirdo is running around in one of the unoccupied wings?\"\\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t have mentioned that,\" he mumbled as he went out the door.\\n\\n \"No, you certainly shouldn\u0027t have mentioned it.\" But her words were lost, cut off by the softly closing door.\\n\\n Verity fell back against the pillows, scowling. There was no way she was going to turn over and go to sleep, not now. She had always been an early riser anyway. Verity threw back the covers and climbed out of bed, wincing slightly at the slight soreness in her thighs. Jonas had been in one of his more energetic moods last night. The man had a way of leaving his mark on her, she thought wryly as she headed for the bathroom.\\n\\n And now he wanted to put a ring on her finger. Talk about being marked for life. But when she looked in the bathroom mirror she was surprised at the warm and secretive smile on her face.\\n\\n A vast sense of relief flooded through her.\\n\\n The decision had been madeâ€”she was going to marry Jonas. Now that she\u0027d decided to take the step, she wondered why she\u0027d stalled for so long. She should have trusted her intuition, the same intuition that had sent her straight into his arms the very first time.\\n\\n There were no guarantees in this world. It was true that her relationship with Jonas had some bizarre twists, and there were some questions for which there would never be any real answers.\\n\\n But she loved him and he loved her. For better or worse they were linked together. And now they were going to have a baby. All in all, marriage seemed reasonable, even right, under the circumstances. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-66.html","bookId":1796,"book":{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO.
