{"id":80064,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"Jonas\u0027s mind went blank for a moment. He couldn\u0027t believe what he was hearing. When his brain kicked into gear again a few seconds later, it was all he could do to keep from yelling so loud that every guest on the floor would hear. \"What the hell do you mean, you-don\u0027t-think-it\u0027s-necessary-thank-you-very-much?\" he ground out between clenched teeth. \"We have to get married.\" She drew her knees up under the sheet and wrapped her arms around them tightly. Her hair was in wild disarray, and the expression on her face was more set and stubborn than Jonas had ever seen it. \"I don\u0027t see that anything has changed much, Jonas. If we didn\u0027t have to get married last week, we don\u0027t have to get married this week.\" \"You\u0027re pregnant!\" \"So?\" His mind raced, searching for the correct approach. \"You want this kid to be born a bastard?\" \"There are no bastards in the state of California. By law every child is legitimate. Your name can go on the birth certificate.\" \"Thank you very much. Jesus.\" He quickly abandoned that tactic and tried another. \"I thought you\u0027d want marriage. I thought you\u0027d be happier married, more secure. I thought you\u0027d appreciate the sense of stability. Verity, this is ridiculous. You know you\u0027d be happier married now that you\u0027re going to have a baby.\" \"I don\u0027t want to be married simply because I\u0027m pregnant.\" Jonas\u0027s mouth fell open as he dimly began to perceive the source of the trouble. \"Oh, Christ,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t tell me… \" \"If you had really wanted to marry me you could have asked me anytime during the past few months. You never said a word.\" \"Now, Verity… \" \"I wonder when Caitlin is going to call.\" Verity glanced at the phone, then at her watch. \"It\u0027s only ten. She\u0027s a night person. She\u0027s probably still going through those old files.\" \"Verity, shut up and listen to me, dammit. You\u0027ve got this all wrong,\" Jonas said harshly. \"The only reason I didn\u0027t ask you to marry me before now was because… because… \" For Christ\u0027s sake, think, you fool. But how could he explain that he had just never thought about the matter until now? Everything had been so comfortable. He had been content. \"There was no need. No rush, I mean. Everything was going along fine, we were getting to know each other. Establishing a relationship. Yeah, that\u0027s what we were doing—establishing a relationship.\" \"A relationship, Jonas?\" Jonas wished he\u0027d read some of those pop psychology books about male-female relationships that were always being churned out. Trouble was, women were the only ones who read that sort of thing. Therefore, only women knew the right words and euphemisms; only women had a good command of the vocabulary needed to talk oneself out of a mess like this. A man was left stranded and helpless. \"I would have gotten around to marrying you eventually. The baby just speeds things up a little, that\u0027s all.\" Verity smiled wryly. \"Relax, Jonas. You don\u0027t have to think of any excuses. I appreciate the gesture, but I assure you it\u0027s not necessary. There really is no need for us to get married.\" \"This is not a gesture, dammit. I am not thinking up excuses. You want an apology? All right, I apologize for not having asked you to marry me before you got pregnant. It was just an oversight.\" \"Don\u0027t apologize. I don\u0027t want any apologies. And I don\u0027t like being an oversight.\" Her self-control slipped for a moment. For a split second Jonas caught a glimpse of the wariness and the very feminine anger that lay in the depths of her eyes. Then she had herself back in hand. \"You\u0027ve been honest with me this far, don\u0027t spoil your track record. As I said, I appreciate your offer of marriage, but there\u0027s no need for it. There\u0027s no reason things can\u0027t continue just as they have been for the past few months.\" \"What about your father? You think Emerson is going to like this?\" He was clutching at straws and he knew it. Verity chuckled. \"You know my father well enough to realize that if he hasn\u0027t come after you with a shotgun by now, he\u0027s not likely to ever. He likes you. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be pleased about the baby. But he raised me to make my own decisions. If he gives you a hard time, just tell him you did the noble thing and offered marriage. When he hears I\u0027m the one who chose not to accept the offer, he\u0027ll back off. He knows me.\" \"I know you, too, Verity. Well enough to realize you\u0027re making the wrong decision here. You\u0027ll be much happier married. Trust me.\" \"In spite of the psychic link we share, Jonas, there are still a lot of things we don\u0027t know about each other. Don\u0027t assume you understand me perfectly, and don\u0027t assume you know what\u0027s best for me. You don\u0027t. Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me, I think I\u0027ll go down the hall to the bathroom.\" She reached for her cane and slid out of bed. \"Maybe you don\u0027t understand me all that well, either,\" he shot back, feeling frustrated. \"Maybe you\u0027re making some dumb assumptions here, lady.\" She didn\u0027t bother to answer. She was sliding her feet into her slippers. Jonas\u0027s hand clenched and unclenched as he watched her with brooding eyes. A few minutes ago everything had seemed crystal clear and totally straightforward. He and Verity had been living together. They were in love. She was pregnant with his kid. It was time to get married. Nothing could be simpler or more logical. It hadn\u0027t even occurred to him that she would refuse him. But it should have, he thought angrily as he watched her make her way to the door. He should know by now that Verity was stubborn, unpredictable, and far too independent for her own good. He\u0027d complained to her father about those faults on several occasions. But this was one of the few times Jonas had run up against Verity\u0027s feminine pride, and he didn\u0027t know quite how to deal with it. Apparently the little firebrand was too proud to marry him just because of the baby. She had wanted to be asked properly, he realized. She had wanted to be married for her own sake, not simply because there were extenuating circumstances. But he wasn\u0027t marrying her just because of the baby. He knew that, even if she didn\u0027t understand. Why in hell hadn\u0027t he thought about marrying her last month? Jonas wondered in disgust. The answer was simple: last month he had taken everything about their relationship for granted. It hadn\u0027t occurred to him to formalize things, for the simple reason that everything was working out just fine. He had assumed that Verity was happy too, at least until she had started subtly withdrawing from him. Jonas wondered how long she would hold his bad timing against him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-40.html","bookId":1796,"book":{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO.
