He and his sister Elyssa are staying at the resort. After I sprained my ankle on the steps this evening, I called Laura. She came right over, and the Warwicks came with her. It was really very kind of them. I was a little frightened, you see.\"\\n\\n Jonas dropped into a crouch beside the sofa. He touched the bandaged ankle with surprisingly gentle hands. \"Frightened because of the fall?\"\\n\\n \"No, because of what made me fall.\"\\n\\n Jonas\u0027s head came up sharply.\\n\\n \"Someone was in the house when I got home from the spa tonight, Jonas. He came rushing out, knocking me to one side. I barely caught myself in time to keep from falling down the steps.\"\\n\\n Jonas stared at her in amazement. \"Holy shit! Are you serious?\"\\n\\n \"Very.\"\\n\\n \"Someone got in here?\" Jonas\u0027s hand tightened on Verity\u0027s knee as he glanced around the comfortably furnished room.\\n\\n Verity followed his gaze. \"Doesn\u0027t look like he took anything, does it? The stereo is still here, and so\u0027s the television. I must have interrupted him before he had a chance to do any damage. That reminds me—I\u0027m supposed to phone the sheriffs office and let them know if anything\u0027s missing.\" She reached for the phone on the end table.\\n\\n As she dialed, Jonas prowled around the room, opening the cupboards and checking the closets. Then he disappeared down the hall to the bedroom. When he returned, Verity had finished her brief report and was hanging up the phone.\\n\\n \"Dammit, I go away for less than five days and you get yourself into trouble,\" Jonas growled as he stalked into the kitchen.\\n\\n \"I did not get myself into trouble. I was the innocent victim of an intruder.\" Verity heard the clink of a bottle against glass. \"Make mine juice.\" A moment later Jonas reappeared with two glasses. One was filled with cranberry juice.\\n\\n \"Did you lock the door before you went over to the spa tonight?\" He sat down beside her and handed her the juice.\\n\\n \"No. I never lock it. You know that. We don\u0027t have any crime around here.\"\\n\\n \"Well, we do now, don\u0027t we? Of all the crazy, idiotic excuses. How many times have I told you to lock that front door?\"\\n\\n \"Now, Jonas… \"\\n\\n \"And this business of walking alone over to the spa late at night has got to stop. From now on, either I go with you, or you stay home and find something else to do.\"\\n\\n \"Now, Jonas… \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to know where this Warwick character got the idea he could just pick you up and carry you around. What made him volunteer to play rescuer, anyway? Laura and Rick could have handled things just fine.\"\\n\\n \"Jonas… \"\\n\\n \"Jesus. A man comes home after a hard week on the road, and the first thing he sees is his woman being carried through the doorway in some other guy\u0027s arms. It\u0027s enough to make a person think seriously about bringing back chastity belts.\"\\n\\n Verity lost her patience. \"Jonas, you\u0027re beginning to sound like an irate husband. I think you\u0027ve said enough. In case it has escaped your notice, I am the injured party here. Furthermore, I don\u0027t want to hear another nasty word about Doug Warwick. He\u0027s a very nice man, and, more important, he\u0027s a client of yours.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a what?\"\\n\\n Verity coughed delicately. \"I think it would be easier to explain everything tomorrow morning. You look worn out, and heaven knows I\u0027m exhausted after all the excitement. My ankle hurts, and I just want to go to bed and get some sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Oh no you don\u0027t. What is this about Warwick being a client?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a long story, Jonas. I\u0027d really rather explain it in the morning.\" She smiled up at him tentatively. \"It\u0027s just a business matter. Jonas, I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re home safe and sound. I was so worried about you.\"\\n\\n \"Verity… \"\\n\\n \"My ankle is throbbing, you know. I thought I\u0027d broken it at first. That deck is quite treacherous when it\u0027s icy.\"\\n\\n \"Dammit, Verity… \"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so good to have you home, Jonas,\" she said wistfully. She touched his shoulder, letting her hand trail down his arm. \"You look like you\u0027ve been through the wringer.\"\\n\\n \"I need a shower,\" he admitted, swallowing the rest of his brandy.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you go take one?\"\\n\\n He rubbed his jaw. \"I also need a shave.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure about that. The beard is kind of sexy.\" She touched the side of his face.\\n\\n He looked at her with a sudden, fierce desire. \"I also need you.\"\\n\\n Verity\u0027s smile was very gentle and inviting. \"I don\u0027t see any reason why you shouldn\u0027t have everything you need tonight. Why don\u0027t you start with the shower?\"\\n\\n He stared at her mouth. \"Why do I let you get away with murder? Eating vegetarian food all these months must have softened my brain.\" He leaned down to drop a hard, fierce kiss on her waiting lips.\\n\\n Then he headed for the bathroom.\\n\\n Verity waited until she heard the water running in the shower before she rose cautiously from the sofa.\\n\\n She found she could make her way around the room fairly well using the fireplace poker as a cane.\\n\\n Humming softly, she locked the door and turned off the living-room lights, then hobbled down the hall to the bedroom.\\n\\n When the bathroom door opened fifteen minutes later, Verity was lying in bed, propped up against the pillows. Her red hair was a fiery halo around her head, and the nightgown she wore was one she had purchased shortly after Jonas had become her lover. It was not designed for cold winter nights. It was a froth of black lace and satin, and it did interesting things for the soft curves of her br**sts.\\n\\n Jonas came into the bedroom wearing a towel around his waist and using another towel to dry his thick, dark hair. He stopped abruptly when he caught sight of her.\\n\\n \"Given the fact that you were once upon a time a prissy little spinster, you certainly have come a long way.\" Jonas slung both towels over a chair and walked to the bed. He stood looking down at her, his body fiercely aroused. \"I missed you, sweetheart.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad.\" Verity pushed back the covers, making a place for him beside her. \"I missed you too, Jonas.\\n\\n I was so afraid that something would happen to you.\"\\n\\n He got into bed and took her into his arms. \"You were the one who wound up getting hurt. Just goes to show you.\" He kissed her throat and slid a hand inside the black lace bodice of her nightgown. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-11.html","bookId":1796,"book":{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO.
