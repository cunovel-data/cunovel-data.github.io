{"id":80041,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\"I know,\" Verity agreed readily. Her momentary amusement faded. \"There are a lot of things about you that aren\u0027t even twentieth-century. Sometimes I think you would have done very well back in the Renaissance, Jonas.\" He moved across the room with that peculiar, gliding grace that came so naturally to him, and tipped up her chin with one hard finger. \"You think so?\" \"I know so.\" \"They had ways of handling troublesome females back then.\" \"Is that right?\" She grinned. \"You\u0027ll have to demonstrate sometime. Meanwhile, we\u0027d better get dressed for dinner.\" She moved away from him. \"I hope you packed that nice sweater I gave you for Christmas.\" \"You know it\u0027s packed. You put it in my bag yourself.\" \"So I did.\" \"Very wifely of you to remember my sweater,\" he observed softly. Verity flinched and began to unpack busily. \"Packing your sweater wasn\u0027t a wifely act. It was the act of a shrewd business manager who wants you properly dressed for the client.\" \"I see.\" He watched her closely for a long moment, then silently started to undress. Elyssa and Doug were waiting for them downstairs in a grand salon that ran most of the length of the old villa\u0027s south wing. Most of the room was in shadow, the old furniture covered in sheets. Only a small section at the far end of the salon, near the deep fireplace, had been made reasonably comfortable. Several people were seated on the worn furniture, chatting quietly. A fire blazed on the old hearth. \"Come in, we\u0027ve been waiting for you. I want you to meet everyone.\" Elyssa swept forward, her jewelry jangling and her long white skirt swirling. She took Jonas\u0027s arm and guided him toward the small group. Verity made a face behind her lover\u0027s back and limped bravely forward on her own. A young, thin, bearded man wearing round, wire-rimmed glasses rose and came toward her. He had very dark, serious eyes. \"Hello,\" he said in a low voice as he took her arm. \"I\u0027m Oliver Crump. Let me give you a hand.\" \"Thank you.\" Verity beamed at him, aware that Jonas had glanced back just in time to catch her dazzling smile. His disapproving look encouraged her to turn up the smile a few more watts. He deserved it for letting himself be swept off by Elyssa. \"Verity Ames. I\u0027m Jonas\u0027s business manager.\" \"Oliver is a healer,\" Elyssa explained brightly. \"Aren\u0027t you, Oliver?\" \"I work a little with herbs and crystals, that\u0027s about all,\" Oliver Crump said quietly. His brows came together in a fierce line as he looked down at Verity\u0027s injured foot. \"What did you do to your ankle?\" \"Slipped on an icy deck.\" \"How many days ago?\" \"A couple.\" She looked down. \"The swelling has started to go down but it\u0027s still sore.\" Crump helped her into a heavy wooden chair with a threadbare green velvet cushion. The thick arms and legs of the chair were ornately carved. Verity leaned back experimentally, wondering how old it was. Late nineteenth century, she guessedâ€”certainly not Renaissance. \"Let me introduce the people with whom I share the paths to enlightenment,\" Elyssa said. She stood gripping Jonas\u0027s arm as she waved at the small circle of faces. \"Oliver Crump, as I just mentioned, is a psychic healer. And that\u0027s Preston Yarwood over there by the liquor cabinet. Preston is the leader of our little group. He\u0027s a marvelous teacher, so inspirational. He\u0027s been interested in psychic studies for years, long before it became so popular. He studied with Ilhela Yonanda, you know.\" \"Is that right?\" Verity said, wondering who Ilhela Yonanda was. \"How do you do?\" Yarwood spoke from the dark corner near the fireplace, where he was pouring drinks. \"Understand your plane was a little late.\" He sounded vaguely satisfied about that. When Yarwood stepped forward to nod at Verity and shake Jonas\u0027s hand, the firelight gleamed on the scalp showing through his thinning hair. He appeared to be in his midforties, a short, dynamic-looking man with a rather florid face and a slight paunch. His gaze was intelligent and observant. He had the serene, blissful smile Verity was coming to think of as the New Age look. Yarwood wore a tastefully expensive plum-colored sweater. His well-cut wool trousers had pleats, and Verity was willing to bet that his loafers were Italian. There was a heavy gold watch on his wrist, the face of which was solid black. Verity was impressed. Running psychic-development seminars was obviously lucrative, as Doug had remarked. \"What can I get you, Verity?\" Yarwood asked politely. \"Fruit juice would be fine.\" \"I had a feeling you would drink juice,\" Preston murmured softly, as if another prediction had just been verified. \"And you, Jonas?\" \"Scotch if you\u0027ve got it.\" Jonas took the seat next to Elyssa. \"And this,\" Elyssa went on smoothly, indicating another young man slouched in a corner of the sofa, \"is Slade Spencer. Slade is a new member of our circle, although he\u0027s been studying various paths on his own for years, haven\u0027t you, Slade?\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s me. Always on the road to enlightenment.\" Slade Spencer concentrated for a moment on packing a fragrant-smelling pipe. His hands appeared to tremble slightly. The small task accomplished, he stretched out his long, jean-covered legs. Slade seemed to be in his late twenties or early thirties, but Verity couldn\u0027t tell for sure. He ignored Jonas and smiled slowly at Verity as he reached for a glass on the table beside him. Spencer\u0027s face had a pinched, ascetic look, and his eyes were feverishly bright beneath his dark brows. He was so thin that he appeared almost gaunt. There was a sense of nervous energy about the man, as if some part of him was always in motion or, Verity realized with sudden intuition, always struggling to maintain control. \"I admit I\u0027ve been attracted to the concept of an altered state of consciousness for some time now,\" Slade said, enunciating carefully, as if he didn\u0027t quite trust his tongue not to trip him up. \"I have this theory that most of us are living in a very unnatural state of consciousness, and that the normal, natural state for human beings is actually what\u0027s usually referred to as an altered state. I see the true natural state as a deeply sensual one. A state in which we use all our senses to learn the true meaning of pleasure and personal satisfaction. What do you think? Are you headed in the same direction, Verity?\" Verity blinked. She realized that Slade Spencer had been hitting the booze rather heavily for the past couple of hours. \"Actually, I\u0027m into cooking,\" she said. She glanced around the room and saw the blank expressions. \"Vegetarian cooking,\" she added quickly, hoping that would buy her some credibility.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-17.html","bookId":1796,"book":{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO.
