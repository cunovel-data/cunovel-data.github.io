The ship was foundering, men were overboard, and shark fins cut through the churning water. She knew exactly how they felt. She cleared her throat nervously.\n \"Sometimes things happen that aren\u0027t exactly planned,\" she began cautiously, her back toward him.\n \"Sometimes a person\u0027s timing isn\u0027t quite right. It\u0027s nobody\u0027s fault, it just happens.\"\n \"For Christ\u0027s sake, Verity, will you stop beating around the bush and just say what you have to say?\"\n \"All right. How would you feel about becoming a father, Jonas?\"\n \" What? Holy shit!\"\n There was a scrabbling sound, some thumping, and another muttered curse. Verity whirled around and saw Jonas staggering wildly, his arms flailing. His pants were tangled around his knees and he had lost his balance. He clutched wildly for the nearest bedpost, hopping around on one foot. The expression on his face was one of incredulous disbelief.\n Verity watched in amazement as Jonas landed heavily on the edge of the bed and slid down to the floor.\n She\u0027d never seen him lose his balance before. All the effortless physical grace that characterized his movements had suddenly deserted him.\n There was a solid thud as Jonas landed on his rear end, his ankles trapped inside his half-lowered pants.\n He sat looking up at her, his eyes filled with amazement.\n \"You want to run that question by me again?\" he asked in a hoarse voice.\n Something squeezed Verity\u0027s stomach tightly. \"You heard me the first time. How do you feel about becoming a father?\"\n \"I take it,\" Jonas said carefully as he kicked off his shoes and pants and climbed slowly to his feet, \"that this is not a hypothetical question?\"\n Verity wrapped her arms around herself and shook her head. \"I\u0027m afraid not. I\u0027m pregnant, Jonas.\"\n \"How long have you known?\" He tossed aside the pants and came toward her. His jaw was set and his eyes were unreadable.\n Verity looked down at the floor. \"I assume you\u0027re not thrilled. I didn\u0027t think you would be.\"\n \"I asked you how long you\u0027ve known.\" He reached her and took her chin in his hand. He lifted her face so that she had to meet his blazing eyes.\n \"Not long. I had a suspicion before you left with Dad.\"\n \"And you kept it to yourself.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t about to use the possibility of my being pregnant as a way to keep you from going off with Dad.\" Her eyes were alive with pride.\n \"Did it ever occur to you that I had a right to know?\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t even sure about it myself until this morning,\" she said defensively.\n \"What happened this morning that convinced you?\"\n \"I more or less had it confirmed,\" Verity explained, remembering the strange conversation she\u0027d had with Oliver Crump. \"Please don\u0027t yell at me, Jonas. I told you as soon as I was certain.\"\n \"Thanks. I appreciate that,\" he retorted grimly. He cradled her pale face between his hands. \"Verity, you little idiot—you shouldn\u0027t have kept it to yourself this long. You should have told me the instant you suspected you might be pregnant. No wonder you\u0027ve been more temperamental and emotional than usual. I should have guessed.\"\n For some reason Verity grew furious at his words. \"I have not been acting more temperamental or emotional than usual. I never act temperamental or emotional, so how could I be more so than usual? I always act in a perfectly reasonable, rational manner. I\u0027ll have you know I happen to possess plenty of common sense, unlike some people I could mention, and I resent the implication that I\u0027m temperamental and emotional and strange!\"\n \"Hush, honey.\" He laughed indulgently and pulled her tightly against him. \"Take it easy.\" His arms went around her and his palms moved soothingly up and down her spine. \"Just take it easy, sweetheart.\n Everything\u0027s going to be okay.\"\n \"You haven\u0027t said how you feel about being a father.\" Verity buried her face against his chest.\n \"Well, I haven\u0027t had too much time to think about it,\" he admitted lightly. \"But I don\u0027t see that it\u0027s any big deal. I\u0027m a fast learner. I can always ask Emerson for advice. Look at what a great job he did raising you.\"\n \"Oh, Jonas, this is serious!\" Verity was torn between laughter and tears, in fact, all her emotions seemed suddenly to be too close to the surface. She clung to Jonas, her arms wrapped around his lean waist.\n \"Are you sure you don\u0027t mind?\"\n \"Did you think I would?\" he whispered into her tousled curls. \"Is that why you couldn\u0027t bring yourself to tell me earlier?\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t sure how you would feel about it. I mean, it\u0027s a big responsibility.\"\n \"And you\u0027ve always been a little worried about my attitude toward responsibility, haven\u0027t you?\" he concluded with a hint of exasperation. \"Jesus. No wonder you were so upset about my going off with your father to rescue Lehigh. You probably saw that as an example of how life was going to be from now on. Except that in the future you\u0027d be left behind with a kid whenever I took off.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know what to think.\"\n He gave her a small shake. \"I told you that was a one-shot deal, not a lifetime pattern. I\u0027m different from your father. We have some overlapping interests and experience, but we\u0027re not the same. Come on, Verity. Don\u0027t you have any more faith in me than that?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know what to think. I hadn\u0027t planned to get pregnant. Hadn\u0027t even thought about it. We were taking precautions most of the time and I just sort of assumed… \"\n \"We were not taking precautions all of the time. In fact, we rarely remembered them when we came out of our trips into the time corridor,\" he reminded her bluntly. \"And we did a lot of practice sessions with the psychic stuff this past winter.\"\n She sighed. \"I know. I think I somehow convinced myself that sex after one of those trips was different in some way. It always seems so urgent, so demanding. I think of it as being connected to the psychic stuff.\"\n \"And you convinced yourself you couldn\u0027t get pregnant as long as the sex was taking place on a higher plane? A psychic plane? Is that it?\" There was laughter in his voice.\n \"Don\u0027t you dare make fun of me!\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t dream of it, honey. But there is something a tad amusing about you pretending the sex we have after a mind trip is different from the kind we have the rest of the time. Talk about rationalization.\n This from a woman who prides herself on having more common sense than other people, specifically the male of the species?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-38.html","bookId":1796,"book":{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: \n HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO.
