{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: \n HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO. SHE KNOWS HE\u0027S WRONG...IF BABY MAKES THREE. \n Jonas Quarrel was lean, sexy, and equally capable of quoting Renaissance poetry or wielding a dagger. Verity Ames knew Jonas was the perfect partner for an affair--and that he was not the marrying kind. Before long he would be looking for a new excitement, leaving Verity behind to run her gourmet restaurant in a California resort, hold on to misty colored memories, and wonder what she was going to do if she were pregnant with his child. Sure enough, her adventuring lover was soon off to an Italian villa rebuilt on a Pacific Northwest island. Jonas went to hunt for missing Renaissance jewels. Verity went along to snare a husband. A big, soft, four-poster bed might be the ideal place to try out her lures! But in this ancient mansion of hidden passageways and mysterious perils, there were some deadly traps for those blinded by love...unless Verity could help Jonas discover the most precious treasure a woman and man can find.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/gift-of-fire-gift-2.jpg","author":"Jayne Ann Krentz","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":85,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
