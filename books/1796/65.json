Then he tossed the flashlight into his duffel bag and sat on the edge of the bed. Eyes narrowed, he watched Verity as she collected her nightgown and robe.\\n\\n \"Do you really believe I\u0027m just using you?\" he finally asked.\\n\\n Verity busied herself with the buttons of her blouse. \"I shouldn\u0027t have said that. I was angry because you were making a fuss about Oliver Crump.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve never been absolutely sure of me, have you? You can\u0027t forget that the reason I came into your life in the first place was because I knew you could help me control my damn talent. That\u0027s why you\u0027re stalling about marrying me. A part of you is scared to death that the only real tie we have is a psychic one.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not true, Jonas. We have a lot of other ties, as you\u0027ve pointed out.\"\\n\\n \"We sure as hell do. Including the fact that we\u0027re both about to become parents.\" Jonas raked his fingers through his hair. \"I guess I shouldn\u0027t have made that scene about Oliver and his crystals.\"\\n\\n \"No, you definitely should not have snapped at me the way you did,\" Verity said stiffly. \"I like Oliver.\\n\\n He\u0027s sweet and genuine. I was only trying to tell you that if finding the stupid crystal really means so much to you, he might be able to help.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want him linking with you, goddammit.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t \u0027link\u0027 with him. Not the way I do with you.\"\\n\\n \"Well, what do you do with him when you play with those crystals?\" Jonas demanded. He shot to his feet and began pacing the room. \"I saw the way the two of you were touching each other when you were trying to cure Maggie\u0027s headache.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure what was happening, if anything. But I got the feeling Oliver can somehow tune in to crystals and Iâ€¦ I can help him. A little.\" Verity sank down on the bed, hugging her nightgown and robe.\\n\\n \"The same way you help me in the time corridor?\" he demanded harshly.\\n\\n \"No. It\u0027s much different. It\u0027s not personal the way it is with you. There\u0027s no sense of direct contact. I\u0027m sorry, Jonas. I can\u0027t really explain it.\" She glowered at him. \"What\u0027s the big problem here, anyway? I thought you didn\u0027t believe in the power of crystals.\"\\n\\n \"I think I believe in the power of one particular crystal,\" he said bluntly. \"The one that man in the vision left behind here in this villa. We need it to find out what\u0027s going on in that little room at the end of the passage.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think we should try to find out what\u0027s going on in that room, Jonas. I don\u0027t like it. I don\u0027t like any of it.\"\\n\\n He came across the room to stand in front of her. \"I have to know, Verity.\"\\n\\n She looked up at him. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I just have to find out the truth. I won\u0027t be able to rest until I solve this thing.\"\\n\\n \"Even if it means involving me and Oliver Crump?\" she taunted.\\n\\n Jonas caught her arms and hauled her to her feet. \"We don\u0027t need Crump.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure. I don\u0027t know anything about crystals. He\u0027s the one with the expertise.\"\\n\\n \"We can do this without him, dammit.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know? I\u0027m the one who seems to be able to use the crystal, and I\u0027d like some professional advice from Oliver.\"\\n\\n Jonas\u0027s jaw was set rigidly. \"You want to work with Oliver Crump on a professional basis? All right, I\u0027ll allow you to work with him on one condition.\"\\n\\n \"Jonas, I don\u0027t think you understand the situation. I\u0027m doing you the favor. You\u0027ve got no right to set conditions on how I do it.\"\\n\\n \"The hell I don\u0027t,\" he snapped. \"Before you try anything with Crump and his damn crystals, I want your word of honor that you\u0027ll marry me.\"\\n\\n Verity\u0027s eyes widened in amazement. She could hardly believe what she was hearing. \"Let me get this straight. You won\u0027t let me work with Oliver, not even to help you find that crystal, unless I agree to marry you?\"\\n\\n \"I love you, you redheaded witch,\" he said in a thick voice. \"I\u0027m not going to risk losing you to some other man who might be able to latch on to you with a psychic connection. I\u0027d rather call off the search for the crystal than take that chance.\"\\n\\n Verity stood very still in his grasp, trying to marshal her thoughts into some coherent order. \"You think if I agree to marry you that would keep me from getting lured away by another psychic?\"\\n\\n \"If you agree to marry me, you\u0027ll honor your promise. I know you, Verity.\"\\n\\n \"Not well enough, apparently, if you think you have to blackmail and threaten me in order to get me to marry you.\" She smiled suddenly.\\n\\n He stared down at her, his eyes wary. \"Verity?\"\\n\\n \"I love you, Jonas, I\u0027ve told you that a hundred times. I\u0027ll marry you.\"\\n\\n He folded her close with a low growl of relief. \"Jesus, it\u0027s about time, lady.\"\\n\\n Verity leaned her head on his shoulder and relaxed into his warmth. She wrapped her arms tightly around his waist and savored his lean strength. \"You know something, Jonas? When I first met you I would never have guessed that you\u0027d be the marrying kind.\"\\n\\n \"And I had the impression you\u0027d opted for professional singlehood. We both had a lot to learn about each other.\"\\n\\n \"I hope we\u0027re doing the right thing.\"\\n\\n \"We are,\" he told her with grave assurance. He raised her chin with his finger and brushed his mouth across her lips. \"Believe me, the only option we have open is to get married. I couldn\u0027t stand living with any other alternative. I realized that the night you told me you were pregnant.\"\\n\\n He moved his lips lightly across hers again, and then he began to deepen the kiss. His arms tightened around her and Verity was pulled snugly against the taut outline of his thighs. He deliberately widened his stance and urged her closer so that she could feel his heat. His manhood, trapped beneath his jeans, pushed against the gentle curve of her stomach. Verity gave herself up to the passion that always seemed to flow so easily between them.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s going to be hard to think of myself as a married woman,\" she murmured against his throat.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027ll remind you every chance I get.\" Jonas picked her up and settled her down on the bed.\\n\\n \"Jonas?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" His voice was a lazy, sleepy growl in the darkness.\\n\\n \"If we\u0027re going to get married, I think we should do it right.\"\\n\\n \"Right? What do you mean? There\u0027s only one way to do it. You get some blood tests, a license and a ring, and you say a few words in front of a duly constituted authority. Then you get to go to bed. What\u0027s the big deal?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-65.html","bookId":1796,"book":{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO.
