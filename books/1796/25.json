{"id":80049,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Verity felt the air around her shimmer slightly. She got out of bed and pulled on her robe. \"Okay, master historical scholar. What\u0027s with that section of wall?\" \"I\u0027m not sure yet. Whatever it is, it\u0027s not enough by itself to trigger a trip into the psychic corridor. But there\u0027s something here. Let\u0027s take a look behind this tapestry.\" He lifted the old fabric carefully and peered at the wall. \"You with me?\" \"I\u0027m here.\" She walked over to stand near him. \"All I\u0027m getting are a few faint vibrations. I can keep them under control.\" Verity nodded and sucked her lower lip between her front teeth. She could feel herself beginning to perspire again. Jonas put his hand flat on the wall and moved it slowly along the stone surface. \"Watch out for booby traps,\" Verity muttered. \"I think we\u0027ll sense them before we spring them.\" \"Only if they\u0027ve already been sprung by some other unfortunate treasure hunter,\" Verity pointed out. Jonas\u0027s psychic talent was linked to violence. If the traps had been used in a deadly manner at some point in the past, he would sense it. But if they had never been sprung, there would be no previous history of violence to alert him. \"All I\u0027m getting is a vague feeling of danger—almost like a warning. It was the same way when I opened the stone where the crystal had been kept. It\u0027s strange, Verity. It\u0027s as if someone managed to plant mental warnings around his secrets, not just a few hidden stilettos.\" His hand continued to glide over the stones. When he touched a chink in the mortar there was a distant dull thud that sounded like ancient machinery moving inside the wall. Verity shivered inside her robe. \"I think I\u0027m onto something here,\" Jonas said softly. Verity heard the controlled excitement in his voice. \"You\u0027re enjoying this, aren\u0027t you?\" \"I think I could get into treasure hunting. It\u0027ll never replace dishwashing as a satisfying career, but it might make a hell of an interesting hobby. What do you think?\" \"I\u0027m beginning to think I was nuts to have you take this job.\" \"But this is a hobby we can share together. Some people ski together; others play tennis. You and me, we\u0027ll be part-time treasure hunters.\" Verity was considering the pros and cons of this when a large section of the wall creaked loudly, groaned, and then swung inward. A wave of musty air billowed out. \"Whew!\" Jonas stepped back quickly. \"It smells awful in there.\" Verity peered into the dark passage that had been revealed. \"Probably full of rats.\" Jonas went back across the room and returned with the flashlight and his knife. \"What\u0027s that for?\" Verity demanded, eyeing the knife. \"You never know. The door is so heavy I don\u0027t think it can close again unless it\u0027s pushed, but I\u0027ll prop this chair against it, just in case. Wouldn\u0027t want to get trapped inside this passage.\" He hauled a heavy chair to the opening in the wall and placed it firmly across the threshold. \"All right. Stay behind me and don\u0027t touch anything.\" \"Don\u0027t tell me, let me guess,\" Verity said. \"In spite of what common sense dictates, we\u0027re going to explore this secret passage, right?\" \"We\u0027re after treasure, remember? This is the sort of place people bury treasure. At least, it\u0027s the sort of place they would have buried it four hundred years ago.\" \"Are you still getting some vibrations, Jonas?\" Verity hurried over to where she had left her shoes. Jonas was already stepping into his boots and buttoning his shirt. \"All I\u0027m getting are a lot of old echoes. Nothing specific, and nothing to worry about.\" \"If you say so.\" She followed him into the dark corridor. The passageway was narrow. The stone ceiling was just barely tall enough for her to stand upright. Jonas had to duck his head. \"Men were a little shorter four hundred years ago,\" he remarked. The flashlight beam revealed an empty stone tunnel that seemed to follow the inside wall of the bedroom. At the point where the adjoining wall connected, the interior corridor turned to follow it. \"Do you suppose this passage connects the entire villa the way the main hall does?\" Verity asked. \"Possible.\" \"Yuck. Look at the dust.\" Verity lifted the hem of her nightgown and then gasped. \"Jonas—look at the footprints in the dust! Someone\u0027s already been in here.\" Jonas bent to examine one footprint. \"There\u0027s a thick layer of dust inside it, so it\u0027s safe to say it\u0027s been a long time since someone walked through here.\" \"Maybe it was Digby Hazelhurst.\" \"Could have been. The prints are too mixed up to tell if there was more than one person in here. Digby probably made several trips down this passage once he discovered it. I\u0027ll bet he was excited.\" Jonas stood up and started down the corridor. \"It\u0027s cold in here. You should have brought your jacket, Jonas.\" \"Yes, dear.\" He glided on down the passageway. Verity raised her eyes toward the dark ceiling of the stone tunnel and swallowed a retort. \"You know, I don\u0027t think I like this place, Jonas.\" \"Want to go back to the bedroom and wait for me?\" \"No, I most certainly do not.\" \"Then stick close and stop complaining.\" \"I was not complaining. I was making an observation, and I do not want… Oops.\" Verity stopped and looked down. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Jonas swung around, playing the flashlight over her. \"I hit something with my foot.\" \"Let me see that. Looks like part of an old sword.\" Jonas picked up the dark, tarnished chunk of metal. It fit into his palm as if made for it. \"Wait!\" Verity cried out as the stone corridor immediately began to give way to another kind of corridor, one that she knew existed only in her mind and Jonas\u0027s. She was too late to stop the transition. Jonas was gripping the broken sword firmly, and the walls of the psychic time tunnel coalesced around them. She held her breath as reality shifted and a second reality was superimposed on the first. When she opened her eyes she was standing beside Jonas in an endless tunnel, staring at an apparition that hovered in midair in front of them. The image was of a grim-faced, powerfully built man who appeared to be in his late forties or early fifties. He was seated at an intricately carved wooden desk littered with ancient tomes and writing instruments. The man was dressed in a wine-colored velvet doublet and hose, and he wore a waist-length fur-trimmed cloak. Several heavily embossed rings adorned the apparition\u0027s fingers, and the hilt of a jewel-encrusted sword was just visible under the fold of his cloak.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-25.html","bookId":1796,"book":{"id":1796,"title":"Gift of Fire (Gift #2)","description":"Storyline: HE FIGURES ONE AND ONE EQUAL TWO.

Sure enough, her adventuring lover was soon off to an Italian villa rebuilt on a Pacific Northwest island. Jonas went to hunt for missing Renaissance jewels. Verity went along to snare a husband. A big, soft, four-poster bed might be the ideal place to try out her lures!
