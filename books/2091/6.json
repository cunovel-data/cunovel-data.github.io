{"id":90069,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The tinkling of the shop bell interrupted our conversation.\n \"Excuse me,\" Cassandra said.\n \"I need to go anyway.\"\n I tried to return the gris-gris, but she wouldn\u0027t take it.\n \"That\u0027s for you.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"It\u0027ll protect you against the mojo from the flower.\"\n \"Sure it will.\"\n She tilted her head. \"What can it hurt?\"\n \"Depends on what you put in here. Bats\u0027 wings? Puppy dog tails? I\u0027m allergic.\"\n Cassandra laughed. \"Nothing so ominous. Some herbs, red pepper. Dust from the grave of a believer.\"\n I made a face.\n \"Kidding,\" she said. \"I also put in a little something to keep the beasts of the swamp away.\"\n \"Right. That oughta work.\" Along with a gun and a baseball bat.\n \"If you\u0027re going to be working in the swamp, I doubt you\u0027ll want the alligators hanging around.\"\n I shoved the gris-gris into my pocket.\n \"In the old days, people placed charms in their left shoes,\" Cassandra continued, \"but the old days are the reason a lot of folks wound up lame.\"\n \"I can\u0027t imagine why.\"\n \"Just keep the gris-gris on you by day and under your pillow by night. Make sure you take it out before the maid sees. Some tend to get a little freaked if they find them.\"\n I couldn\u0027t tell if she was teasing or not. Probably not.\n \"Let me know how things work out,\" she said. \"I enjoyed talking to you.\"\n I\u0027d enjoyed talking to her, too. I didn\u0027t have many friends. Hell, I didn\u0027t have any. Once I\u0027d found Simon, I\u0027d let the few I had drift away. I was in a bizarre profession, which didn\u0027t lend itself to camaraderie. I disappeared at the ring of the phone, never knew when I\u0027d come back, forgot lunch dates, could care less about movies. And the other cryptozoologists...\n Well, they\u0027d as soon steal your Loch Ness Monster as look at you.\n Arriving back at the hotel, I discovered the maid had cleaned my room and departed. I dropped my clothes on the floor, left a request for a wake-up call for an hour before dusk, then shoved the gris-gris beneath my pillow.\n After the dream I\u0027d had last night... Well, as Cassandra said - couldn\u0027t hurt.\n I slept like the dead, waking with a yelp when the phone shrilled next to my ear. A recorded voice reminded me of my wake-up call.\n No gifts on the bed. My gris-gris was right where I\u0027d left it. Yay.\n I got dressed, pocketed the charm, grabbed my camera, my cell phone, and a tote bag to put them in, then went to meet Charlie.\n He was waiting when I pulled up at the dock. The sun cast orange rays through the trees and across his face. I blinked. For an instant the light had taken on the shade of fresh blood.\n I pushed aside the disturbing thought. I was the moon goddess, not a prophet, if I believed Cassandra\u0027s name-dropping. But what did a moon goddess do? I probably didn\u0027t want to know.\n The gris-gris weighed heavily in my pocket, and I was tempted to throw the talisman into the drink. But I didn\u0027t want Charlie to see it. The way he\u0027d behaved this afternoon at the mansion, anything weird might spook him away for good.\n \"Ready?\" he asked.\n In lieu of an answer, I climbed into the boat, and we headed off. Night settled over us like a cool velvet curtain. The stars came out, and the crescent moon rose.\n Charlie turned on the spotlight attached to the front of the boat, and I stared, transfixed, at what seemed like a hundred shining orbs in the water.\n \"Gators,\" he said. \"They like the dark.\"\n In the daytime it was easy to believe the alligators were slow and unthreatening. Not very many of them out here at all. But in the night, surrounded by their glowing eyes, every one of which seemed to stare directly at me, they seemed very threatening indeed. I longed to be back on solid ground.\n \"Where are we going?\" I asked.\n \"Thought you wanted to see the place where the body was found.\"\n \"I do.\"\n Charlie pointed straight ahead. \"Right there.\"\n \"Who discovered it?\"\n \"Me.\"\n \"You?\" I stared at him incredulously. \"You said you hadn\u0027t seen the wolf.\"\n \"Friend of mine did.\"\n \"So it didn\u0027t necessarily kill the man.\"\n \"Guy\u0027s throat was torn. Paw prints all around him.\"\n \"Not a coyote?\"\n \"Coyotes are scavengers and cowards. They wouldn\u0027t kill a man.\"\n \"Neither would a wolf.\"\n Charlie shrugged. \"Me and my friend was huntin\u0027 nutrias, found the body. I stayed, while he looked around. Said he saw a wolf disappearing into the tall grass.\"\n \"He\u0027s sure he saw a wolf?\"\n \"Huge, black, big head, long legs. He shot it, but the thing disappeared.\"\n \"He\u0027s sure he hit something?\"\n \"Found a bit of blood. Nothin\u0027else.\" :\n \"Isn\u0027t it illegal to shoot a wolf ?\"\n The species was still endangered in some areas, threatened or protected in others, though their numbers had increased sufficiently in a few northern states for them to be delisted. In other words, wolves could be killed by certain people with good cause, not by any old person whenever they felt like it.\n \"No law around here like that,\" Charlie said. \"Ain\u0027t no wolves.\"\n I went silent, thinking, as Charlie pointed the boat at the shore. \"I\u0027d like to get a peek at that body.\"\n I didn\u0027t realize I\u0027d spoken out loud until Charlie an- swered. \"Already in the crypt, I\u0027m sure.\"\n \"Crypt?\"\n \"Whole city\u0027s below sea level.\"\n Ah, the singular burial practices of New Orleans. While I wasn\u0027t an expert, I had read an entire guidebook that I\u0027d bought at O\u0027Hare before getting on the plane.\n For hundreds of years, citizens of the Crescent City stacked their dead on shelves inside brick monuments known as ovens. After a year and a day, the body was decomposed enough to dump into a well with all the others who had gone before, making room for the next entrant on the assembly line of death.\n Most people choose to be buried in a family crypt. Better to spend eternity mixed with Gramma than the psycho next door.\n I was pulled from my thoughts when the boat bumped against the embankment.\n \"You stay here,\" Charlie said. \"I\u0027m gonna clear the gators out of the way.\"\n \"Swell.\" I contemplated the staring eyes. \"What if one of them wants to climb aboard?\"\n My hand crept to the pocket that held my gris-gris. I sure hoped the thing worked, and wasn\u0027t that a change in attitude?\n \"I doubt they could, but - \" He leaned over, flicked the catch on the cabinet beneath his seat, and pulled out a handgun. \"There ye go.\"\n Picking up a bat, he strode into the night.\n The weight of the gun felt good in my hand. Not only had I taken self-defense classes, but I\u0027d learned how to fire both a rifle and a handgun. I wasn\u0027t half-bad.\n Water lapped against the boat in a rhythm that would have been peaceful if it weren\u0027t for the bobbing army of eyes. I began to feel chilled, and it wasn\u0027t lack of the sun. Something was watching me again.\n I glanced at the tributary. A lot of somethings.\n A rustle from the bank made me start. \"Charlie?\"\n I waited, but Charlie didn\u0027t appear.\n \"Charlie?\" I called a little louder, startling the alligators that had swum in close.\n The brush seemed to be waving in a nonexistent breeze. I crept to the front of the boat and shifted the spotlight.\n The glare blazed across the top of the grass, splashed off the crooked limbs of the cypress trees, and revealed an indentation in the flora, as if a large body was moving steadily toward...\n \"Charlie!\"\n His answer was a scream, a gurgle, then silence.\n I jumped out of the boat, not even thinking about the alligators, not even caring. At least I remembered the gun.\n The spotlight lit my way as I headed in the direction of the scream. Charlie must have gotten rid of all the alligators in the vicinity, unless they\u0027d smelled my gris- ; gris, or maybe they\u0027d slithered back into the water to avoid...\n Whatever the hell had come after Charlie.\n I paused, listened, caught a faint rumble to my left Tightening my fingers around the gun, I barreled through the overgrowth, shouting Charlie\u0027s name.\n Some animals will run if you startle them. Then again, some won\u0027t\n I\u0027d come far enough that the light from the boat was fading. When I burst through a tangle of weeds and into a small clearing, I had to squint to see. Or maybe I just had to squint because I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes.\n Charlie was on the ground. Dead from the appearance of the throat wound. A man knelt next to him, fingers pressed to Charlie\u0027s neck. At first I thought he\u0027d been attacked, too.\n Blood all over a bare chest will give that impression.\n But with that much blood, I should see a gap, a tear, a great big hole. He definitely shouldn\u0027t have been able to stand, to move, to walk toward me. I panicked and lifted the gun.\n \"Stop.\" My voice sounded thick, as if I were speaking through swamp water.\n The man kept coming - fast - his long, dark hair flying around his face, giving me tantalizing glimpses of a nose, a chin, teeth. He snatched the pistol, and the bronze bracelet on his wrist shimmered as he tossed the weapon aside. I\u0027d never flicked off the safety, but he didn\u0027t know that.\n Then he shook back his hair, and I couldn\u0027t think beyond the sight of the face I\u0027d seen twice - in the picture on the wall of the Ruelle Mansion and in my erotic dream of the night before.\n \"You\u0027re - \"\n I meant to say dead, but the word froze on my tongue when he grabbed me.\n Solid, warm, real. He wasn\u0027t a ghost.\n So what in hell was he? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-6.html","bookId":2091,"book":{"id":2091,"title":"Night Creature: Crescent Moon (Nightcreature #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Crescent Moon(Night Creature series book 4) \n New Orleans is known for sinful pleasures and strange magic, but for cryptozoologist Diana Malone it offers one irresistible attraction.
