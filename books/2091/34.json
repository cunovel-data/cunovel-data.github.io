{"id":90097,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"My eyes snapped open. How long had I been asleep? I lay on my sleeping bag, alone - nothing new there. What was new was the crescent moon centered in the window, a bright silver slash against an indigo sky. \"Showtime,\" I muttered. I\u0027d rather Adam were with me, wouldn\u0027t mind having him around while I spent the rest of the night in a tree with my dart gun. But he hadn\u0027t offered and I hadn\u0027t asked. In fact, neither one of us had said a word. He\u0027d behaved as if he were drawn to me even though it was wrong, stupid, destructive. He\u0027d behaved like a man who couldn\u0027t help himself, and that wasn\u0027t love. But it was something. I dug out some jeans and a dark T-shirt. As an afterthought I tucked both gris-gris in my pocket. Alligators I didn\u0027t need, and one never could tell when the truth might come in handy. The dart gun was loaded, but I put some extra darts into my backpack, along with a bottle of water and some cookies. I could be out there all night. Last, I opened the cooler I\u0027d bought in town yesterday and withdrew a long white paper-wrapped package from the ice. The trek to the clearing was uneventful. Though it would be too much to hope for that the loup-garou was poised to step into my trap, nevertheless, I approached quietly, just in case. However, when I pushed through the tall grass, the only thing I saw was an empty cage. Not that it was easy to see it, if I do say so myself. I\u0027d positioned the apparatus, large enough to hold ten grown men, beneath a particularly weepy-looking cypress tree. After I rearranged the moss and the ground cover, the metal was almost impossible to distinguish by the simple light of a crescent moon. I tossed the contents of my white paper package inside. \"Fresh steak ought to entice you.\" Wolves preferred live prey, but they weren\u0027t against a free meal when they could find one. Me, I couldn\u0027t stomach tying up a live creature to await a bloody death. Prime rib would have to do. Over the past few days I\u0027d not only readied the cage, the darts, the gun, I\u0027d also readied a second perfect cypress nearby: tall, with acres of moss. I\u0027d placed a portable tree stand about twenty feet off the ground. I tied my rifle to the rope I\u0027d strung over a branch. Using the heavy-duty nails I\u0027d pounded into the tree, I climbed to the flat metal stand. After allowing my gaze to wander over the area, I hoisted my gun upward by way of the rope pulley, secured the safety strap around my waist - more fatal hunting accidents occur when hunters tumble out of their trees because they fall asleep, have a heart attack, or are just plain stupid than when they are actually shot - and settled in to wait. The sounds of the swamp surrounded me. I\u0027d thought the place loud when I was inside the mansion? I hadn\u0027t met loud yet Birds, insects, alligators, nutrias - out there somewhere I could have sworn I heard a pig squeal. A farm animal gone wild? Or were there wild boars in the depths? I probably shouldn\u0027t have been wandering around as much as I had been without a gun. My gaze was caught by shifting swamp grass beneath an ebbing moon. Not the wind. Something was coming. Slowly I raised the gun. I don\u0027t know what I expected, but when the wolf stepped from the swamp into the clearing, lifting his nose and sniffing, I had to bite my lip to keep from making a sound. His fur shone in the sliver of moonlight, glinting black, then blue, then black again. I\u0027d been right to gauge the dosage for an Alaskan timber wolf. This thing might even be larger than that. The animal paid no attention to the steak. Instead he trotted around and around the open area as if he knew something was there but couldn\u0027t find it. I wasn\u0027t surprised; I didn\u0027t even consider it magic to have the wolf from my dream materialize. I\u0027d seen a black tail. I knew what a wolf looked like. Put one and one together and I got two, even in my sleep. But how was I supposed to determine if this was a real wolf or a werewolf? Mrs. Favreau\u0027s words came back to me: Though the form may be that of a wolf, a werewolf always retains its human eyes. I squinted against the night, against the distance, as the wolf circled away from me again, but I couldn\u0027t see his eyes, let alone determine if they were human. Suddenly he stopped, stiffened, and stared right at me. I hadn\u0027t made a movement, not a sound. What had caused him to sense I was there? Wolves did not peer into trees for their prey. I lifted the gun to my shoulder. He didn\u0027t care. He charged across the clearing as if he planned to climb up the trunk, snarling as if he would tear me apart once he got there. Why wasn\u0027t he afraid of the rifle? He couldn\u0027t know that I didn\u0027t have silver bullets. Right now that seemed like a big mistake. I forced myself to remain steady. To be patient. To aim. I didn\u0027t think a wolf could clamber this high, but I wasn\u0027t taking any chances. Right before I squeezed the trigger, I saw his eyes, and I had no qualms about shooting. I couldn\u0027t determine a color, but I did see the whites. Real wolves didn\u0027t have any. The dart struck him in the chest. He yelped, leaped. My heart did, too. The thing had a damn nice vertical extension. Too nice. If he hadn\u0027t been shot, he might have cleared the lowest branch of my tree, about a yard below my feet. Not that he could have done much damage hanging there, but the ability startled me. What else could he do? The wolf fell to the earth, staggered, toppled, and went still. The silence following so much sound seemed deafening. I needed to drag the beast into the cage, then call Frank. Lucky for me, the animal had dropped over right in front of the enclosure. I wasn\u0027t sure how far I\u0027d be able to move deadweight that approximated my own. Once on the ground, I wasted no time. Though I didn\u0027t want to, I leaned my weapon against the tree. I couldn\u0027t do much with one hand. The grass was damp, so when I tugged on his rear legs, the beast slid. After much grunting and groaning, I had him in the cage. Straightening, I allowed myself to smile. I\u0027d done it. Like a dog dreaming of a rabbit, the wolf\u0027s legs twitched, and my smile froze. He lay between me and the door. \"Idiot,\" I muttered, and leaped over his inert body, skidding on the grass and falling on my ass. Stunned, I didn\u0027t immediately move. Until I heard a low, rumbling growl. I rolled onto my feet in a single movement, which was pretty darned athletic if I do say so myself. Terror will do that to a woman. I dived for the open door as the wolf slowly sat up, shaking his head as if he were coming out of deep water. The dart hadn\u0027t worked very well. Of course it had been fashioned for a 120-pound animal. This one weighed quite a bit more than that. I guess I should count myself lucky he\u0027d fallen over at all. The door clanged and I turned the key, then yanked it out of the lock and backpedaled as quickly as I could. Slipping again, I fell to my knees. Could I be any more of a klutz? I\u0027d specifically requested a lock and key on the cage. A wolf couldn\u0027t undo a catch, but a person could. And if this animal was what I thought it was, he\u0027d have opposable thumbs by morning, if not before. A body slammed into the bars. Snarling and slavering commenced. Still on my hands and knees, I looked up and my whole world shifted. The wolf was exactly like the one in my dream. Huge and black, he also possessed the eyes of Adam Ruelle.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-34.html","bookId":2091,"book":{"id":2091,"title":"Night Creature: Crescent Moon (Nightcreature #4)","description":"Storyline: Crescent Moon(Night Creature series book 4) New Orleans is known for sinful pleasures and strange magic, but for cryptozoologist Diana Malone it offers one irresistible attraction.
