{"id":90065,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Tallient promised there\u0027d be an airline ticket and a check waiting at O\u0027Hare. He was as good as his word.\\n\\n In the meantime, I looked him up on the Internet and remembered why his name was familiar. He wasn\u0027t Bill Gates, but he was close.\\n\\n Tallient had invented a widget for computer modems and become a gazillionaire. At least he could afford me.\\n\\n After an accident several years ago had turned him into a recluse, he\u0027d become fascinated with cryptozoology. Interestingly enough, details on his accident were nonexistent, leaving me to wonder if Tallient had used his tech skills to ensure a little privacy. I couldn\u0027t blame him.\\n\\n Heat slapped me in the face as soon as I walked out of Louis Armstrong International Airport Mid-October and the temperature had to be in the midnineties. No wonder the wolves had long ago fled New Orleans.\\n\\n Along with the plane ticket and the check, Frank, as he\u0027d insisted I call him, had provided a rental car, a hotel room on Bourbon Street, and the name and address of a swamp guide.\\n\\n \"I could get used to this,\" I said as the agent handed me the keys to a Lexus.\\n\\n Shortly thereafter I checked into the hotel and tossed my bag on the bed. I\u0027d have the luxury of running water and sheets only until I found a base of operations. I couldn\u0027t look for a cryptid from town. I needed to be right where the action was at all hours of the day or night. Once I found such a place, I\u0027d have my camping equipment shipped south.\\n\\n I wandered to a set of French doors, which led to a patio. Under the heated sheen of the sun, the rot showed - sidewalks cracking, buildings crumbling, homeless people begging coins from the tourists.\\n\\n One of the bizarre things about Bourbon Street, and there were a lot of them, was how a very nice hotel, like this one, could have a view straight into a strip joint on the opposite side of the street.\\n\\n Two women danced on top of the bar. When they began to do more than dance, and the milling crowd began to cheer, I turned away from the spectacle. I wasn\u0027t a prude, but I preferred my sex in private and in the dark.\\n\\n Or I had back when I\u0027d had sex. Since Simon, there\u0027d been no one, and I hadn\u0027t cared, had barely noticed. But : alone in a hotel room on a street that advertised sex twenty-four hours a day, I felt both deprived and depraved. Hiring myself a swamp guide seemed like a good distraction.\\n\\n I did an Internet search on the address provided by Frank, then drove out of the French Quarter to the interstate, over Lake Pontchartrain, and into Slidell - an interesting combination of commuter suburb and Victorian brick houses. I didn\u0027t have time to enjoy the contrast. I wanted the guide issue settled so I could get to work.\\n\\n I headed past every fast-food joint and franchise restaurant I knew and some I didn\u0027t. Just beyond a strip mall, I took a left, trolling by new houses complete with Big Wheels in the driveways and swimming pools in the backyards.\\n\\n These gave way to older and older residences, then mobile homes, and finally shacks. One more turn and bam - there was the swamp. No wonder I\u0027d heard reports of alligators in people\u0027s yards. What did they expect, putting a backyard near an alligator?\\n\\n I shut off the motor, and silence pressed down on me. The weight of a cell phone in my pocket was reassuring. I could always call... someone.\\n\\n Climbing out of the Lexus, I thanked Frank in absentia. Whenever I was forced into any vehicle smaller than a midsize four-door, I felt as if I were driving a clown car.\\n\\n My mother, also quite tall, was an annoyingly slim woman with ice in her veins and hair as dark as her soul. Though she\u0027d had no patience for fairy tales, she\u0027d insisted I was a changeling. Where I\u0027d gotten light green eyes, bright red hair, and an intense desire to play softball no one seemed to know. My appearance had marked me as an out- sider, even before my behavior had branded me the same.\\n\\n Damp heat brushed my face along with the scent of rotting vegetation and brackish water. My eyes searched the gloom for something. Anything. Though my watch insisted I had a good hour of daylight left, the thick cover of ancient oaks shrouded me in chilly shadow.\\n\\n I saw nothing but a dock and a tributary that disappeared around a bend. Across the water, hundreds of cypress trees dripped Spanish moss into the swamp grass.\\n\\n \"Hello?\" I reached into my pocket and pulled out the note. \"Adam Ruelle?\"\\n\\n The only answer was a thick splash, which halted my stride down the dock. How fast could an alligator travel on land?\\n\\n Not as fast as I could. But what if that hadn\u0027t been an alligator?\\n\\n Wolves are quick, as are big cats, and when dealing with new or undiscovered animals, anything could happen.\\n\\n I took a deep breath. I might have been raised soft, but before Simon and I started spending so much time in the field we\u0027d taken self-defense classes. You couldn\u0027t sleep under the stars in a dozen different states and not run into trouble sooner or later.\\n\\n However, knowing how to disable a man who outweighed me by fifty pounds wasn\u0027t going to do me much good with a wild animal. What had I been thinking to come here alone, without a gun?\\n\\n I snorted. I didn\u0027t own a gun.\\n\\n Slowly I backed toward land, keeping my eyes on the flowing water. The muted splashing came closer and closer. I should make a run for it, but I hated to turn my back on whatever lurked in the depths of the lily pad-strewn tributary.\\n\\n I heard a rustle that wasn\u0027t a fish, wasn\u0027t even water. More like the whisper of weeds, the snap of a twig. Slowly I lifted my gaze to the far shore.\\n\\n A single flower perched atop a waving stalk, the shade of a flame against the dewy blue-green backdrop, and the tall grass swished closed behind a body.\\n\\n Could have been anything, or anyone.\\n\\n \"Except for the tail,\" I murmured.\\n\\n Bushy. Black. I tilted my head. Canine? Or feline?\\n\\n I walked to the edge of the dock to get a better look at what had already disappeared. When water splashed across my shoes, I started, then slipped.\\n\\n I was falling, my arms pinwheeling, my gaze focused, horrified, on the eight-foot alligator, jaws wide and waiting. Someone grabbed me and hauled backward. My heels banged loudly against the wooden slats of the dock, and the alligator let out an annoyed hiss.\\n\\n I expected to be released once my feet touched dirt; instead, my savior, my captor, held on tight.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027re you?\" His voice rasped, as if he rarely spoke, and carried both the cadence of the South and a touch of France. I\u0027d never heard another like it\\n\\n \"D-d-diana,\" I managed, despite a significant lack of breath and a near-painful increase in my heart rate. \"Diana Malone.\"\\n\\n There. I sounded cool, calm, in control, even though I wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"I need a swamp guide,\" I continued.\\n\\n \"No guide here.\"\\n\\n \"I was told there was.\"\\n\\n \"You were told wrong. Take an airboat tour down de way.\"\\n\\n Cajun, I realized as I strained to understand the words past the sexy accent.\\n\\n Sexy? What in hell was wrong with me? I couldn\u0027t even see his face. Guess I had a thing for accents.\\n\\n I tried to recall what I knew about the culture. It wasn\u0027t much. The Cajuns, originally Acadians, had come to Louisiana from France by way of Canada. Most had settled west of New Orleans, become farmers and fishermen, but that didn\u0027t mean a few hadn\u0027t migrated closer to the Crescent City.\\n\\n \"Those folks will even let you hold a baby alligator,\" he murmured.\\n\\n I shivered, remembering how close I\u0027d come to an alligator holding me - and that hadn\u0027t looked like a baby.\\n\\n \"No,\" I managed. \"I need - \"\\n\\n His chin bumped my head; I could have sworn he was smelling my hair. I tensed, trying to remember what I\u0027d been taught to get out of this situation, but nothing came to mind.\\n\\n He was taller, though not by much, and definitely stronger. With one arm he held me so tightly I couldn\u0027t move. I wondered what the other arm was doing until I felt his palm skim up my thigh.\\n\\n \"Hey!\"\\n\\n \"Woman alone shouldn\u0027t come here,\" he whispered. \"You might see\u0027t\u0027ings you should not\"\\n\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n Silence settled over us, broken only by the hum of the bugs skimming across the water. I could have sworn I heard a laugh. However, when he spoke, no humor colored his voice.\\n\\n \"Curious cats should be careful.\"\\n\\n \"Was that a threat?\"\\n\\n \"An observation, cher.\"\\n\\n Cher? I hadn\u0027t laid eyes on his face, and he was calling me dear? Talk about balls. Or maybe I shouldn\u0027t\\n\\n Twisting, I tried to get free, or at least see him. He tightened the steel band he used for an arm, and I couldn\u0027t breathe. My breasts - not large, but not bad - jiggled against his wrist. Something stirred against my backside before he released me with a shove.\\n\\n By the time I\u0027d caught my balance and whirled around, he\u0027d escaped into the cover of the trees, moving with a grace that reminded me of the ABCs I\u0027d been thinking of when he arrived.\\n\\n His white T-shirt stood out in the encroaching night like a flare. The sleeves had been hacked off in deference to the heat, or maybe to reveal tanned, honed arms. Khaki pants hung on slim hips; he wasn\u0027t wearing any shoes. Dark, shaggy hair sifted across his shoulders. I still couldn\u0027t see his face.\\n\\n \"Who are you?\" I whispered.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer, instead lighting a cigarette, cupping the match in such a way as to keep the glow from reaching anything but tobacco. A bronze bracelet, the same shade as his skin, encircled his wrist. I\u0027d never cared for jewelry on men, but on him the adornment only seemed to emphasize his masculinity.\\n\\n \"Seen any wolves?\" I asked.\\n\\n He took a deep drag, as if he hadn\u0027t a care in the world, or an appointment in tins century. Nevertheless, I sensed a wary interest.\\n\\n \"Maybe a black coyote?\" I pressed.\\n\\n The very thought excited me. A black coyote just might get me that Ph.D.\\n\\n \"How about a big cat?\" I continued when he did nothing but take another drag. \"Cougar?\"\\n\\n He blew smoke through his nose. \"No wolves this far south.\"\\n\\n \"Coyotes?\"\\n\\n \"Got \u0027em now. Brought in to hunt nutria rats.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d read about those. Large rodents that resembled beavers but with a ratlike tail. I hoped the coyotes were winning.\\n\\n \"Cats?\" I asked again. \"What about bears?\"\\n\\n \"Bobcat. A few bears. Don\u0027t see \u0027em much.\"\\n\\n I was constantly amazed at how easy it was for creatures to hide in their native habitat.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard there\u0027ve been disappearances. Tales of a wolf.\"\\n\\n \"There will always be tales.\"\\n\\n \"Where there\u0027s smoke there\u0027s fire,\" I pointed out.\\n\\n His cigarette flared red on one end as he drew on the other. \"You a cop?\"\\n\\n \"Scientist.\"\\n\\n Saying I was a cryptozoologist only confused people.\\n\\n He grunted and tossed the butt to the ground. The resulting hiss revealed he\u0027d hit water.\\n\\n \"Can you guide me?\" I stepped forward. \"Do you know Adam Ruelle?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n His voice was mesmerizing. I wanted to keep him talking - forever.\\n\\n A mighty splash was followed by a thud on the dock. I spun around, remembering there were more wild animals in the swamp than furry ones, but there was nothing there.\\n\\n Just as there was nothing when I turned back to the trees - no man, no beast\\n\\n Hell, I couldn\u0027t even find the cigarette butt \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-2.html","bookId":2091,"book":{"id":2091,"title":"Night Creature: Crescent Moon (Nightcreature #4)","description":"Storyline: Crescent Moon(Night Creature series book 4) \\n New Orleans is known for sinful pleasures and strange magic, but for cryptozoologist Diana Malone it offers one irresistible attraction.
