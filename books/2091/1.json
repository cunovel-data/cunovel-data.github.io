{"id":90064,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"A life spent fulfilling a vow to a dead man is really no life at all, but I\u0027d loved Simon Malone, and I\u0027d promised.\\n\\n I\u0027m a zoologist by trade, a cryptozoologist by choice. If I\u0027d followed my training, I\u0027d be holed up in a zoo or worse, studying giraffes and pygmy goats.\\n\\n Instead, I trace rumors of mythical animals and try to prove they exist. A frustrating exercise. There\u0027s a reason no one\u0027s captured a Bigfoot They don\u0027t want to be found, and they\u0027re a lot better at hiding than anyone on earth is at seeking. Or at least that\u0027s my theory, and I\u0027m sticking to it\\n\\n Most cryptozoologists attempt to find undiscovered species or evolutionary wonders - real animals, nothing paranormal about them - but not me. Nope. I\u0027d made that vow.\\n\\n Foolish, but when a woman loves a man the way that I loved Simon, she does foolish things, especially when he\u0027s dying in her arms.\\n\\n So I follow every legend, every folk tale, every scrap of information, trying to uncover something mythical and prove it real. Though I\u0027ve never believed in magic, my husband did, and the only thing I\u0027ve ever believed in was him.\\n\\n I was having very little luck with my quest until the night the phone rang at 3:00 A.M. Insomnia and a very empty checking account made me answer it despite the hour.\\n\\n \"Hello?\"\\n\\n \"Dr. Malone?\" The voice was male, a bit shaky, old or perhaps ill.\\n\\n \"Not yet\"\\n\\n I needed to find a cryptid - translation: unknown animal - prove its existence, write a thesis. Then I could attach those lovely letters - Ph.D. - at the end of my name. But since the whole vow incident, I\u0027d been too busy chasing lake monsters and Sasquatch clones to spend time finding a new breed of anything.\\n\\n \"Is this Diana Malone?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Who\u0027s this?\"\\n\\n \"Frank Tallient\"\\n\\n The name sounded familiar, but I couldn\u0027t figure out why. \"Have we met?\"\\n\\n \"No. I got your number from Rick Canfield.\"\\n\\n Swell. The last guy who\u0027d said those immortal words, \"You\u0027re fired.\"\\n\\n Rick was a lawyer who\u0027d gone on a fishing trip with a bunch of other lawyers near Lake of the Woods, Minnesota. In the middle of the night he\u0027d seen something in the lake. Something slick and black and very, very big.\\n\\n Being a lawyer, he was smart enough to know he shouldn\u0027t tell the others he\u0027d lost his mind. Not yet.\\n\\n Instead, he\u0027d gone home, searched the Internet, and made some phone calls, trying to find someone to help him discover if what he\u0027d seen had been real or imagined. He\u0027d found me.\\n\\n \"Rick thought you\u0027d be free to help me,\" Tallient continued.\\n\\n I was free all right Unemployed. Again. A common occurrence in my life. I was very good at looking for things, not so good at actually finding them. However, I was one of the few cryptozoologists willing to travel on a whim for cash.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t associated with a university - not anymore. Not since Simon had gone over the edge, tarnishing both his reputation and my own.\\n\\n I depended on the kindness of strangers - hell, let\u0027s be honest and just call them strange - to fund my expeditions. Until tonight, I\u0027d been fresh out of both.\\n\\n \"Since you didn\u0027t locate Nessie - \" Tallient began.\\n\\n \"Nessie\u0027s the Loch Ness Monster. I was searching for Woody.\"\\n\\n Which was the name Rick had bestowed on the thing. ; People have no originality when naming lake beasts, always opting for some variation of the body of water they supposedly resided in.\\n\\n Typically, the moment I\u0027d arrived at Lake of the Woods with my cameras and recorders whatever Rick might have seen had gone poof. If it had ever been there in the first place.\\n\\n In my expert opinion, an obscenely large muskie was responsible for the tales, not a supernatural lake monster, but I hadn\u0027t been able to prove that, either.\\n\\n \"I have a job for you,\" Tallient continued.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m listening.\"\\n\\n I had no choice. Though my parents were incredibly wealthy, they thought I was nuts and had stopped speaking to me the instant I married Simon.\\n\\n After all, what could a handsome, brilliant, up-and-coming zoologist from Liverpool see in a not-very-pretty, far too sturdy grad student unless it was her parents\u0027 millions? He already had a green card. That Simon had told them exactly what they could do with their money had only made me love him more.\\n\\n In truth, I fit into Simon\u0027s world better than I\u0027d ever fit in my own. I stood five-foot-ten in my bare feet; on a good day I weighed a hundred and seventy. I liked the out-of-doors - didn\u0027t mind dirt or sun, wind or rain. I\u0027d joined the Girl Scouts just so I could camp. I\u0027d done pretty much anything and everything I could think of to emphasize my differences from the never-too-rich, never-too-thin lifestyle of my mother.\\n\\n \"Can you access the Internet?\" Tallient asked.\\n\\n \"Hold on.\" I tapped my laptop, which sprang from asleep to awake much quicker than I ever did. \"OK.\"\\n\\n Tallient recited a www-dot address. An instant later, a newspaper article spilled across my screen.\\n\\n \" \u0027Man Found Dead in a Swamp,\u0027\" I read. \"Not unusual.\"\\n\\n Swamps were notorious dumping grounds for bodies. If the muck didn\u0027t take them, the alligators would.\\n\\n \"Keep going.\"\\n\\n \"Throat torn. Feral dogs. Huh.\" I accessed the next page. \"Child missing. Coyotes. No body. Seems straightforward.\"\\n\\n \"Not really.\"\\n\\n Tallient recited a second address, and I read some more. \"Wolf sightings.\"\\n\\n My heart increased in tempo. Wolves had been Simon\u0027s specialty; they\u0027d turned into his obsession. Now they were mine.\\n\\n \"Where is this?\" I demanded.\\n\\n \"New Orleans.\"\\n\\n If possible, my heart beat even faster. Once red wolves had roamed the Southeast from the Atlantic to the Gulf and west to Texas. They\u0027d been sighted as far norm as Missouri and Pennsylvania. But in 1980 the red wolf had been declared extinct in the wild. In 1987 they\u0027d been reintroduced, but only in North Carolina. So...\\n\\n \"There aren\u0027t any wolves in Louisiana,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Precisely.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a legend, though...\" I struggled to remember it. \"Honey Island Swamp monster.\"\\n\\n \u0027I doubt that Bigfoot-like footprints found thirty years ago have any relationship to death, disappearance, and wolves where they aren\u0027t supposed to be.\"\\n\\n He had a point.\\n\\n \"Could be an ABC,\" I ventured.\\n\\n The acronym stood for \"Alien Big Cat\" - a cryptozoological label given to reports of out-of-place felines. Black panthers in Wisconsin. A jaguar in Maine. Happens a lot more than you\u0027d think.\\n\\n Most of the tune ABCs were explained away as exotic animals released into the woods when they became too hard to handle or too big to fit in an apartment Funny thing was, no one ever found them.\\n\\n If they were pets, wouldn\u0027t they be easy to catch? Wouldn\u0027t their bones, or even their collars, turn up after a truly wild animal killed them? Wouldn\u0027t there be at least one record of an ABC being hit by a truck on the interstate?\\n\\n But there wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"This is a wolf, not a cat,\" Tallient said.\\n\\n I was impressed with his knowledge of cryptoterminology but too caught up in the mystery unfolding before my eyes to compliment him on it\\n\\n \"Same principle,\" I murmured. \"Could be someone dumped a wolf in the swamp. Nothing special about it\"\\n\\n Except wolves weren\u0027t vicious. They didn\u0027t attack people. Unless they were starving, wolf-dog hybrids, or rabid. None of which were a good thing.\\n\\n \"There\u0027ve been whispers of wolves in and around New Orleans for years,\" he continued.\\n\\n \"How many years?\"\\n\\n \"At least a hundred.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n Tallient chuckled. \"I thought you\u0027d enjoy that. The disturbances don\u0027t seem to occur in any particular month, or even a common season. But they always happen during the same lunar phase.\"\\n\\n \"Full moon,\" I guessed.\\n\\n No matter what the skeptics say, full moons drive people and animals wacko. Ask anyone who\u0027s ever worked in an emergency room, psych ward, or county zoo.\\n\\n \"Not full,\" Tallient said. \"Crescent\"\\n\\n I glanced at the thin, silver, smiling moon visible from my window. \"What was the date on those articles?\"\\n\\n \u0027\u0026#8226;May.\"\\n\\n I frowned. Five months ago. \"Since then?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing.\"\\n\\n \"Could be because the bodies weren\u0027t found.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. Things that hunt under a certain phase of the moon do so every month. They can\u0027t help themselves.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure about \"things,\" but I was sure about animals. They were nothing if not creatures of habit.\\n\\n \"A body was found yesterday,\" Tallient continued. \"Hasn\u0027t hit the papers yet.\"\\n\\n I looked at the moon again. Guess I was right\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your interest in this?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Cryptozoology fascinates me. I\u0027d love to go on an expedition, but I\u0027m... not well.\"\\n\\n I stood. My feet literally itched. I bounced on my toes as excitement threatened to make me jump at this chance. I had to remember What seemed too good to be true often was.\\n\\n \"You want to pay me to find a wolf where a wolf isn\u0027t supposed to be. Once I do, then what?\"\\n\\n \"Trap it and call me.\"\\n\\n Not an unusual request in my line of work. The people who hired me usually did so in the hopes that they would become famous by revealing some mythical creature to the world, and they wanted to be the ones to do the revealing. I had no problem with that as long as the disclosure took place. All I wanted was to prove Simon hadn\u0027t been crazy.\\n\\n \"I can do that,\" I agreed.\\n\\n \"You do realize this isn\u0027t just a wolf ?\"\\n\\n I hoped not, but my hopes weren\u0027t often realized.\\n\\n \"They call it a loup-garou,\" Tallient continued. \"That\u0027s French for - \"\\n\\n \"Werewolf.\"\\n\\n The rush of adrenaline made me dizzy. Though I took jobs searching for any paranormal entity - beggars couldn\u0027t be choosers - the true focus of my quest should have been a lycanthrope. As Simon\u0027s had been.\\n\\n The only problem was, I just couldn\u0027t believe. Even though my maiden name was O\u0027Malley and my father\u0027s family hailed from the land of leprechauns and fairies, in\\n\\n Boston, where I grew up, the only fanciful thing was the city\u0027s rabid belief in a curse on the BoSox.\\n\\n In my youth there\u0027d been no nonsense allowed - no Santa, no tooth fairy - I had to fight to read fiction. Which might explain why I fell so in love with a man who dreamed of magic.\\n\\n I glanced around our apartment near the campus of the University of Chicago. I hadn\u0027t moved a book, hadn\u0027t given away his clothes, hadn\u0027t realized until just this moment how pathetic that was.\\n\\n \u0027I find it strange,\" Tallient continued, \"that odd things happen under a crescent moon in the Crescent City, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n I found it more than strange. I found it irresistible.\\n\\n \"Are you interested?\"\\n\\n Why did he bother to ask? He had to have heard how Simon had died. He had to know Dr. Malone\u0027s sterling reputation had wound up in tatters. Tallient might not be aware that I\u0027d vowed to make everyone who\u0027d scorned Simon eat their words, but he had to suspect it considering what I\u0027d been doing in the four years since my husband had died.\\n\\n My gaze fell on the only picture I had of Simon - knee-deep in a Canadian lake, sum, scholarly, blond, and brilliant - his grin still made me yearn. My stomach flopped as it did every time I remembered he was gone forever. But his hopes, his dreams, his work, lived on in me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be on a plane in the morning.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-1.html","bookId":2091,"book":{"id":2091,"title":"Night Creature: Crescent Moon (Nightcreature #4)","description":"Storyline: Crescent Moon(Night Creature series book 4) \\n New Orleans is known for sinful pleasures and strange magic, but for cryptozoologist Diana Malone it offers one irresistible attraction.
