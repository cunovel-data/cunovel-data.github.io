{"id":90089,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"I expected the usual slam bam without even a \"thank you, ma\u0027am,\" sex that bordered on rough, a rocketing orgasm. Instead he slowed things down, and I was lost\\n\\n \"Come.\" He took my hand; he pulled me across the floor.\\n\\n I followed obediently, drunk on the taste of his mouth, the scent of his skin. I figured we were headed for the couch and that was fine with me, yet when I hesitated halfway across the room, he turned, shaking his head.\\n\\n \"Not tonight. Tonight we do this right.\"\\n\\n We hadn\u0027t been doing it right? Could have fooled me.\\n\\n His bed was made, which gave me a start He didn\u0027t seem the kind of guy who bothered. Then again, from the military corners and the tight white sheets, maybe he couldn\u0027t help himself.\\n\\n Just like I couldn\u0027t help myself. Certainly I\u0027d proved he wasn\u0027t an evil soulless beast or the walking undead. But even if he had been, could I have resisted him? I wasn\u0027t sure.\\n\\n He climbed onto the bed, never letting go of my hand. Did he think I\u0027d run if he released me? I wouldn\u0027t get far.\\n\\n Even as a man, he could catch me. Especially since I\u0027d let him.\\n\\n The ripple of muscle across his abdomen was accented by the line of his pants. Not a centimeter of excess flesh lapped over the waistband. Reaching out, I traced my thumb along a ridge, and his skin fluttered beneath my touch.\\n\\n I wanted to taste him, feel life against my lips, push aside the button, the zipper, and lay claim to what was beneath. I wanted to make amends for doubting him, if not for the knife.\\n\\n What guy wouldn\u0027t appreciate a blow job apology?\\n\\n His slacks were worn soft from years of use. The single button popped free with very little encouragement\\n\\n He watched me through slitted, lazy eyes, though the hardened length of his body revealed a coiled tension, the tangle of his hair hinted at a certain wildness.\\n\\n The rumble of his zipper as I tugged it down seemed to fill the room, electrify the air. He continued to watch me without a word or a movement, except to lift his hips just enough so I could slide the pants down. No underwear lay beneath, only skin.\\n\\n I wanted to learn every line and every curve. Since he didn\u0027t appear to be going anywhere, I indulged myself.\\n\\n A light dusting of hair covered his legs, just enough to make them manly, not enough to nudge them toward beast. I trailed my fingernails through the curls, up the inside of his thighs, and he quivered. How far could I go before he lost control?\\n\\n My hands roved higher, thumbs skating over the curve where his leg became his hip. He arched, begging me to touch him. I couldn\u0027t deny a need I felt so deeply myself.\\n\\n I lowered my head, and my hair spilled over his chest, hiding me from view as I hovered, my breath brushing his pelvis, making him think, Yes, maybe, now, before I pressed my mouth to his belly, let my tongue circle his navel, then trace a moist path downward.\\n\\n My breasts cradled his erection. His pulse beat in time with mine. He slid through my cleavage, such that it was, simulating the intimate act. I lowered my head and licked him just once.\\n\\n His body leaped in response. Eyes closed, he moved against me, and I lost myself watching his face. The man enjoyed sex. With him, I enjoyed it, too.\\n\\n Not that I hadn\u0027t before, but when love is involved the act is more about mind than body, heart than hands, lips, and tongue. There was something to be said about sex for the sake of sex.\\n\\n My nipples tightened, hardening as they brushed his upper thighs. The rhythmic strokes sent a bolt of heat through me. I wanted to lift my body over his, take him deep within. I wanted to ride him until we were both mindless and begging.\\n\\n But not yet.\\n\\n I inched downward and he let me go, hands sliding over my shoulders, up my neck, across my face. His fingers tangled in my hair as I took him in my mouth. He caressed my scalp with languid strokes, guiding, encouraging, urging me on.\\n\\n He lasted a good long while. His control was downright impressive. It became a battle of wills; who would surrender first, him or me? I didn\u0027t plan to lose. I wouldn\u0027t\\n\\n My tongue did things I\u0027d only imagined. I used my teeth where I\u0027d never used them before. Still he didn\u0027t come, didn\u0027t speak, didn\u0027t move anything but his fingers through my hair.\\n\\n I grasped him at the hilt, ran my thumb down his length, followed with my tongue, scraped him with my teeth, and his hand finally tightened.\\n\\n His face was set, his eyes brighter, lighter than I remembered. As I held his gaze, I licked him, once, twice, three times, swirling softly, then taking him all and suckling hard.\\n\\n He swelled and grew, so close to erupting. Frantic, I rode him with my mouth, drawing him to the back of my throat, then nearly setting him free.\\n\\n \"No,\" he murmured, the rumble of his voice making my lips tingle, my ears buzz. \"Please.\"\\n\\n I lifted my head and he groaned. I blew on the chilly dampness left by my tongue, and his eyes fluttered closed.\\n\\n \"Please what?\"\\n\\n I closed my teeth over his tip, scored the skin just a little. His eyes shot open. I expected something gruff, perhaps crude. But had anything ever been as I expected with him?\\n\\n \"Take me inside, cher. I want to feel your body all around me.\"\\n\\n I frowned at the request, too personal, too revealing. I was tempted to finish him off despite any protest. He was too close; a few more strokes, and he\u0027d be able to do nothing but come.\\n\\n Though oral sex could be more intimate than anything else, right now it wasn\u0027t. There was a distance between us, a distance I wanted to keep. Why was he trying to breach it?\\n\\n His hand still tangled in my hair, his thumb stroked my cheek. My eyes burned, and my chest ached. This was so not a good idea.\\n\\n In spite of that, I was captured by his gaze, compelled by his voice, murmuring words in French that I didn\u0027t understand.\\n\\n I did as he wanted, because I wanted it, too, surrounding him, taking him in. We moved together as if we\u0027d done this a thousand times. The advance, the retreat, so new and yet so familiar, first filling me up, men nearly leaving me alone. The latter made me clutch him tight, hold him close, grasp him in the depths of myself, and consider never letting him go.\\n\\n \"Look at me,\" he ordered.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want to. If I didn\u0027t see his face, he wasn\u0027t a man, or a beast, he was a ride, albeit a damn good one.\\n\\n Disgusted with my thoughts, I again did as he asked, meeting his gaze, seeing myself. Who was that woman? Could she be me?\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t think of him when I\u0027m inside you.\"\\n\\n I said nothing, not even when he arched his back and touched me more deeply than ever before.\\n\\n \"Say it,\" he whispered. \"Say it, or I won\u0027t make you come.\"\\n\\n Even if I could have spoken, I didn\u0027t know what he wanted. He stopped moving - a little too late.\\n\\n The release began so small, so far away and yet so large, so near, I wasn\u0027t sure if the spasms were him at first or me. Didn\u0027t matter, because both of us were rocking together, coming apart.\\n\\n I collapsed on his chest; he ran his hand up my back. The world returned, and he was still inside me. I was draped all over him. Uncertain, almost childlike, he began to play with the fleur-de-lis chain at my waist.\\n\\n \"What did you want me to say?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"My name. That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n I lifted my head, shifted my body, but kept our legs tangled together. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"You said \u0027Simon\u0027 de last time you were in my bed.\"\\n\\n I flinched at the sound of my husband\u0027s name while my body still tingled from another man. I didn\u0027t want to talk about Simon. Not now, not ever, and definitely not here and not with him.\\n\\n \"I was asleep,\" I snapped. \"It isn\u0027t as if I called you Simon while you were doing me.\"\\n\\n This time be flinched, and I got worried. Was he expecting more than I could ever give? He didn\u0027t seem the type. Then again, what type was he?\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Adam.\" I rolled onto my back so we were no longer touching. \"I wouldn\u0027t like it if you said another woman\u0027s name, either. Even though...\"\\n\\n I paused, uncertain what to say.\\n\\n \"Even though there\u0027s nothing between us but tins?\" he finished.\\n\\n I turned my head; our noses nearly brushed. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n For just an instant I wondered if it could be more. If I could love another man the way I\u0027d loved Simon. If I could love this man.\\n\\n \"I wish I could love you,\" he whispered.\\n\\n Was he reading my thoughts? Mirroring them? And speaking of mirrors...\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have any,\" I blurted.\\n\\n Confusion flickered over his face. \"Love?\"\\n\\n \"Mirrors.\"\\n\\n The confusion fled, replaced by wariness, just before the stoic mask returned. He\u0027d shut me out as if he had something to hide.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like mirrors, cher.\"\\n\\n \"Because ...?\"\\n\\n He sat up, presented me with his back. \"What you want me to say? That I can\u0027t see my reflection? Or that I don\u0027t want to?\"\\n\\n I sat up, too, but turned toward him. Something was going on here; I just couldn\u0027t figure out what\\n\\n \"There are things I\u0027ve done,\" he said softly. \"Things you couldn\u0027t imagine.\"\\n\\n Was he talking about the army? Or something else?\\n\\n \"What did you do?\"\\n\\n He stood, muscles rippling in his back, his legs, his arms. \"More than I can ever say.\"\\n\\n \"I meant, what was your job in the army? Detective Sullivan couldn\u0027t access your file.\"\\n\\n \"My life then is dead. I\u0027m here now, and I\u0027ll never be free.\"\\n\\n He spun around, putting his hands on the bed, leaning over me, crowding into my space. \"I\u0027m not de man for you.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t love you.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t love you.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t ask me to.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t.\" My voice was clipped, my back tense to the point of aching.\\n\\n \"Just so we\u0027re clear.\"\\n\\n \"Crystal.\"\\n\\n His lips twitched. \"What you so mad about, cher? I\u0027m just gettin\u0027 things out in de open. No hard feelings later that way.\"\\n\\n \"Fine with me,\" I said, but my back was stiffer than a scrub brush bristle.\\n\\n He sank onto the bed, rubbed a big hand over my shoulders.\\n\\n \"Shh,\" he whispered, pulling me into his arms. \"We both want de same thing. While you\u0027re here, we\u0027ll be together. When you go, we won\u0027t be.\"\\n\\n \"OK.\"\\n\\n \"Because you will go.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n Especially since he hadn\u0027t asked me to stay. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-26.html","bookId":2091,"book":{"id":2091,"title":"Night Creature: Crescent Moon (Nightcreature #4)","description":"Storyline: Crescent Moon(Night Creature series book 4) \\n New Orleans is known for sinful pleasures and strange magic, but for cryptozoologist Diana Malone it offers one irresistible attraction.
