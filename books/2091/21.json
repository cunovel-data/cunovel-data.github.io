How had he gotten in without my hearing him?\n I wasn\u0027t sure I wanted to know. If he was a vampire, did I plan to put a stake through his heart? I was fresh out\n \"Well,\" he drawled. \"Do you?\"\n While the appropriate response to that question would be Of course not! instead, I snapped, \"How long have you been there?\"\n Adam shoved away from the wall and stalked toward me. His hair tangled when he shoved it out of his face; his bracelet caught the moonlight and sparkled. He wore a powder blue short-sleeved dress shirt, unbuttoned, and his chest rippled beneath a sheen of sweat that should have been unattractive but wasn\u0027t. Combined with the ragged jeans and bare feet... I wanted him so much I couldn\u0027t think straight\n He stopped directly in front of me. I had a perfect view of his crotch, which didn\u0027t look half-bad, either.\n Because I wanted to lean forward and pull down the bulging zipper with my teeth, I stood. On the way up, my breasts brushed his chest, and he hauled me against him.\n \"You think I\u0027m a vampire, Diana?\"\n The question should have been foolish. We should both have been laughing. But we weren\u0027t.\n His fingers bruised my skin. His erection pressed against my stomach. His blazing blue eyes seemed to pierce my brain.\n \"Are you?\" I whispered.\n \"No.\"\n The word came off his tongue sounding French. When he kissed me, there was a lot of French in that, too.\n He tasted of hickory coffee - no, wait, that was me. Thick cream, heavy sugar - definitely him. I licked his teeth, wanting more of that taste, since I never dared drink my coffee anything but black.\n With Adam I got all of the flavor and none of the calories. Only later did I realize, I\u0027d also been checking those teeth for a razor-edged sharpness. I\u0027m not sure what I would have done if I\u0027d found some.\n We were frantic again, pulling at each other\u0027s clothes. My top flew one way, my bra the other; his shirt slid from his shoulders and onto the floor. Why was it that every time we came near each other we couldn\u0027t seem to stop this from happening?\n I was on fire, barely able to stand still, desperate for a release that I wasn\u0027t going to get from a kiss, when he backed me against the wall. How had he known I was weak in the knees?\n I murmured my approval, lifting my arms around his neck as he ran his palms from the outside of my breasts to my hips.\n He started, stilled, and stepped back, taking his hands and his mouth with him. I nearly fell on my face without his support\n \"What\u0027s this?\" He unbuttoned my pants, and the fleur-de-lis chain spilled out.\n Oops.\n I studied his face, but, as usual, I couldn\u0027t get a read on him.\n \"I - uh - got it today.\"\n His eyes lifted from their solemn contemplation of my jewelry. \"Why?\"\n \"Protection.\"\n \"From vampires?\u0027 Adam\u0027s lips curved. \"There\u0027s no such thing, cher.\"\n \"Then why did I see Charlie in town?\"\n His lips flattened. \"Dead Charlie?\"\n \"Not anymore. Or maybe again. He blew up.\"\n Adam glanced out the window, then back. \"You\u0027re not makin\u0027 any sense.\"\n \"I saw Charlie, chased him to St. Louis Number One - \"\n \"You nuts? Never go there alone.\"\n I hadn\u0027t been alone, but that was beside the point\n \"Charlie released a woman from her crypt According to the obituary, she died two days ago, but she was walking pretty well last night\"\n \"No one gets buried so quickly.\"\n \"That\u0027s all you\u0027ve got to say?\"\n He touched my forehead. I slapped his hand away. \"I\u0027m not feverish or insane.\"\n \"You saw Charlie and a dead woman walk; then they blew up.\"\n OK, when it was spoken out loud, I did sound nuts.\n \"And you think they were vampires?\"\n \"Maybe. Cassandra said they weren\u0027t zombies.\"\n \"Who de hell is Cassandra?\"\n \"Voodoo priestess.\"\n He stared at me for several seconds. \"My, you have been busy.\"\n Why did his words sound like a threat?\n Because I was paranoid as well as crazy. Oh well, the two went together like franks and beans.\n \"You don\u0027t believe me,\" I said.\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter what I believe; it\u0027s what you believe.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know anymore.\"\n He brushed my hair from my cheek, and this time I let him. \"New Orleans would spook anyone. There are ghosts here, can\u0027t help but be. But de things you\u0027re speaking of...\" He shook his head. \"I don\u0027t think this little old chain will protect you from them.\"\n My chin tipped up. \"You have a better idea?\"\n \"No.\" His gaze lowered. \"I like this one.\"\n In a surprising movement, he dropped to his knees and tugged my jeans over my hips. His breath brushed my thighs, warm and inviting. My underwear followed the same path to the floor.\n \"Would you tell me if you were?\" I asked.\n \"What?\" When he glanced up, his eyes were unfocused, his mouth still swollen from mine.\n Having him kneel at my feet, so gorgeous and tousled and aroused, filled my mind with too many possibilities. Nevertheless, I managed to choke out the question: \"Would you tell me if you were a vampire?\"\n \"Of course not, cher.\"\n Leaning forward, he pressed his mouth against the fleur-de-lis chain, against my belly, and suckled. Skin, metal, tongue, and teeth - the sensation was exquisite.\n If he were a vampire, wouldn\u0027t he be -\n Catching fire? Disintegrating into dust? Howling? Crying? Running?\n He did none of them. But he did do other things.\n The chain - both hot and damp, dry and cool - slipped from his mouth. He kissed me again. Lower.\n My legs wobbled, and he cupped my hips with his big hands, pinning me to the wall as his tongue did amazing things.\n Maybe he was a vampire? Maybe I didn\u0027t give a shit\n My fingers tangled in his hair, holding him closer, urging him on. How could a tongue be so hard and yet so soft, so clever and yet so tentative? Whenever I was on the verge of orgasm, he retreated just enough so I never came, driving me closer, higher, with the next stroke.\n \"I think you\u0027ve had enough.\"\n My eyes snapped open. He stood in front of me.\n \"No.\" I reached for him, and he took my hand, tugging me to the sleeping bag.\n \"We\u0027re not done.\" He gave me a little shove, and I toppled onto the covers.\n As he stood over me in the faint moonlight, I memorized every ripple and curve. Just looking at him made me breathe a little harder.\n He followed me down, brushed a stray strand of hair from my breast. \"When you come, it\u0027s all I can do not to come, too, just watchin\u0027 you.\"\n I wasn\u0027t sure what to say, so I said nothing.\n \"You\u0027re so alive.\" He laid his palm against my chest, dark against light, and pressed until I was supine. \"So warm and soft and - \"\n He broke off, took a deep breath, and let it out \"I can\u0027t sleep nights thinkin\u0027 of being inside of you.\"\n In one swift movement he covered my body with his and slipped in. I bit my lip to keep from making an embarrassing yummy noise at the contact\n \"You\u0027re so tight\" His forehead dropped against mine as he struggled for control.\n \"Sorry.\"\n \"No.\" A puff of air that was laughter hit my cheek. \"That\u0027s good, so good.\"\n I tried to relax, but I couldn\u0027t keep still. I had to have friction. My hips had a will of their own, pumping against him.\n He cupped my breast in one hand, pressed his thumb to my skin. \"I can feel your heart beat.\" His eyes seemed to reflect the three-quarter moon, glowing silver, fading to blue. \"Makes me want to do all sorts of bad things.\"\n \"Just do me.\" I clenched around him. \"Now.\"\n I could feel his heart beat, too, in a completely different place. The pressure, the rhythm, the thud, thud, thud, made me shatter at last.\n When I could see again, breathe again, we lay side by side, him tracing patterns across my stomach and breasts with one finger. \"You still want to search for de wolf that isn\u0027t there?\"\n \"You\u0027re awful accommodating for a man who doesn\u0027t believe we\u0027ll find one.\"\n \"I\u0027D be as accommodating as you like, cher, if you keep accommodating me.\"\n I pinched his arm and he laughed. I got a warm, squishy feeling right above the fleur-de-lis. This was nice.\n Too nice.\n I took his hand, meaning to push it away, but something flickered in his eyes, almost a wince. Instead of letting go, I held on.\n \"Of course the wolf isn\u0027t there,\" I said briskly.\n His eyebrows lifted.\n \"The moon\u0027s nearly full. This is a crescent moon loup-garou.\"\n If I hadn\u0027t been holding his hand, I wouldn\u0027t have felt the slight jerk of surprise. \"Where you hear that?\"\n \"I can read the newspaper, Adam.\"\n An odd expression came over his face.\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\"\n \"No one\u0027s called me by my given name for a long time.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"I don\u0027t see many people.\"\n I tightened my fingers on his. \"Why me?\"\n His lips curved. \"Why not you?\"\n Well, that was flattering.\n I suddenly remembered something I\u0027d meant to ask. \"When I left your place, I - uh, walked around a little.\"\n \"Mmm,\" he said, rubbing his thumb over my palm. I found it hard to think when he did that.\n \"Under the bedroom window it looked like you were going to plant something.\"\n \"Really?\" His expression was as bland as his voice.\n \"I just wondered what\"\n \"You a big gardener, cher? I never would have thought.\"\n Well, what bad I expected him to say? There were wolf trades there and since I\u0027m hiding one, I didn\u0027t want you to see them. Like that would happen.\n Why didn\u0027t I just ask him straight out? He already thought I was loony because of the zombies. If I started talking about my dead husband walking, a mythical black wolf, tracks that weren\u0027t there, Adam might go away and never come back. I wasn\u0027t ready for that yet\n \"You want to wait to search de swamp until de crescent moon returns?\" he asked.\n \"I\u0027m not sure.\"\n His free hand played with the fleur-de-lis chain. At least he could touch it without bursting into flame.\n He pulled me against him, spoonlike, and I was so shocked, I let him. With his breath in my hair and his hand at my hip, I drifted on a cloud of satisfaction and exhaustion.\n Right before I fell into the abyss that was sleep I heard him whisper, \"Better if you wore a silver chain. Two birds, one stone, that way.\"\n I tried to stay awake. Tried to make sense of the comment\n Silver. Was that a hint? Or a warning?\n I was too tired to ask. Too tired to do anything but fall. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-21.html","bookId":2091,"book":{"id":2091,"title":"Night Creature: Crescent Moon (Nightcreature #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Crescent Moon(Night Creature series book 4) \n New Orleans is known for sinful pleasures and strange magic, but for cryptozoologist Diana Malone it offers one irresistible attraction.
