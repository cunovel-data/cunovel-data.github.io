{"id":90098,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.\" I couldn\u0027t stop muttering, couldn\u0027t stop staring. How could this be? I\u0027d touched Adam with silver. He hadn\u0027t minded. The thing in the cage appeared mad, throwing his body against the metal, trying to chew a way out. Blood marred the white spittle dripping from his snout. Maybe the wolf was rabid after all. \"That\u0027s not a wolf,\" I whispered. Absently I shoved the key into my pocket, and my fingertips brushed the gris-gris. The animal howled as if in pain and began to change. The transformation was something from a horror film; at first my mind refused to accept what my eyes couldn\u0027t help but see. The sleek, dark fur receded, becoming shorter and shorter as if it were being sucked through the skin. Paws became feet at the ends of legs and hands at the ends of arms. The claws evaporated the same way the fur had. The neck twisted; the spine lengthened; the animal moaned. Going from quadrapedal to bipedal couldn\u0027t feel good. His snout shortened, dividing into nose and mouth as the canine teeth shrank. The tail disappeared with a thick, wet thunk. The eyes remained the same. Inside the cage stood a naked Adam Ruelle. He didn\u0027t appear upset to be revealed a monster. Didn\u0027t seem to care he was in his altogether for the world to see. In fact, he seemed to like it, or maybe, if the size of his erection was any indication, he liked me. What he didn\u0027t like was the cage. He slammed both hands against the bars and growled, \"Let me out\" I shook my head. I couldn\u0027t speak. \"Goddammit, bitch, set me free!\" I blinked. That didn\u0027t sound like Adam. Of course, what did I know? I\u0027d believed him when he said he wasn\u0027t the loup-garou. He tilted his head to stare at the crescent moon. \"How did you do it?\" \"D-do what?\" \"Make me shift.\" His voice was heated, his gaze anything but. Staring into his eyes, I was reminded of Lazarus - cold-blooded and empty of emotion. This man would kill without flinching and forget about it before the blood dried on the ground. The Adam I knew wasn\u0027t exactly warm and fuzzy, but he wasn\u0027t evil. Or maybe I\u0027d just been too busy getting my brains screwed out to notice. My hand ached from clutching the gris-gris. I glanced down, opened my fingers, and understood. I\u0027d been unable to see the truth until magic cleared my eyes. \"I ran as a wolf under de crescent moon. I have no choice.\" I lifted my gaze. \"The curse.\" \"Oui. But I become a man when I choose, or when de sun comes.\" He swept a hand down his body. \"This was not my choice.\" I folded my fingers around the gris-gris. I had asked for the truth. \"Why you lock me up like this?\" he whispered. \"You know I\u0027d come to you in de night. I like to hear you scream when I fuck you. You didn\u0027t have to put me in a cage.\" I winced at his language and the thought I\u0027d been sleeping with a monster. I\u0027d believed myself in love with him, had begun to imagine a life together. I was a fool. \"Let me go, and I\u0027ll do you right here.\" He took himself in his hand and pumped, then moaned a little. The sound was more of a growl and marched along my skin like biting red ants. \"I\u0027ve been imagining such things, Diana. You, me, this way and that. Have you ever wanted to mate with a beast?\" My eyes widened. I couldn\u0027t speak. Adam seemed like a completely different man. Was he possessed by Satan under the crescent moon? Apparently. \"I\u0027ll shift again. It\u0027ll be doggie style like you\u0027ve never had before. And if you make me howl, I won\u0027t even kill you tonight\" I took a step back and he smiled. Were his teeth growing longer along with his - ? I yanked my gaze away, but not before he saw my unease and smirked. \"With de flower I marked you as mine.\" How could that be? Adam had taken the fire irises away from me, thrown them into the swamp, told me not to pick them again. Was he schizophrenic? That would make a certain kind of sense. I\u0027d read all of Simon\u0027s research into lycanthropy. Many psychiatrists and other physicians believed the historical reports of werewolves stemmed from the behavior of the insane. Back then mental illness was labeled possession. I stared at Adam, locked in a cage. I could understand the theory. \"I watched you whenever I could. De others knew you were mine to keep or kill.\" I guess I hadn\u0027t been crazy when I\u0027d heard more than one wolf in the swamp, seen slinky shadows hi town. History often repeated itself, and one of its great lessons is that evil loves to beget evil. \u0027I wanted to be inside you that first night,\" he continued, \"but de crescent moon called. I had to make do with a few touches.\" No wonder I\u0027d had such an erotic dream at the hotel on Bourbon Street My skin went clammy at that memory and several others. \"Set me free. I\u0027ll get out sooner or later. But if it\u0027s later, you\u0027ll pay. I will do tilings you never imagined. I will keep you alive forever. You will beg to die, Diana, and I will never let you go.\" I wasn\u0027t stupid. If I let him out now, obsession or no, he\u0027d kill me. I rubbed my thumb over the outline of the key in my pocket. If I had my way, he would never see freedom again. \"I have to get back to de boy,\" he whispered. \"He expects me come morning.\" Black dots danced in front of my eyes. Luc. How could I have forgotten? I couldn\u0027t connect the man who\u0027d so tenderly held his son, who had refused to allow me near him lest the boy be hurt when I left, to the one who spoke so calmly of both killing and fucking me. Definitely possessed by Satan. Without another word, I walked away. Adam\u0027s voice followed me down the trail: \"What de hell? You think you can leave me here?\" \"Just did,\" I muttered. \"I will kill you!\" \"Redundant.\" \"I will tear out your guts and strangle you with them. I will drink your blood; I will bathe in it.\" \"Original.\" And pretty scary. Nevertheless, I had to get to Luc and take him away. I ran all the way back to the mansion, grabbed my stuff, and tossed everything into the trunk except the dart gun, Cassandra\u0027s knife, and my cell phone. Those I placed on the front seat. I stared at Adam\u0027s pistol for a second, then realized he wouldn\u0027t have helped me out by loading it with silver, and left the thing in the trunk. Around my waist I secured a fanny pack with my money and travel documents. As I climbed behind the wheel, a howl rose toward the descending moon. Uneasy, I glanced at the swaying swamp. That had sounded close. I floored the accelerator, spewing grass and dirt until I fishtailed onto the highway. Then I used one hand to dial Frank. Since it was the middle of the night, I wasn\u0027t surprised when his machine answered. \"Your loup-garou is confined in a cage in the swamp about a mile east of the Ruelle Mansion,\" I said. \"If you have a problem finding him, call Detective Conner Sullivan and have him take you to the place where Charlie died.\" I hung up and muttered, \"The first time.\" I didn\u0027t consider where I was going, what I was doing, or how I would hide from Adam for the next fifty years. I focused all my attention on getting to Luc and getting him gone. The moon was nearly down; the sun would soon be up. I parked in front of Adam\u0027s trailer. I\u0027d walked halfway to the door before I went back and grabbed the knife. \"Better safe than sorry,\" I murmured, and tucked the weapon into the pack at my waist I decided to make that my mantra. A few seconds later, hand poised to knock, mind occupied constructing a stupendous lie for Sadie, the babysitter, I hesitated, then tried the doorknob. The door swung inward without a sound. After glancing over one shoulder, then the other, I scampered inside. I\u0027d been bent on doing anything it took to get to the child and then kidnap him, but strolling into a house uninvited made me uncomfortable. I crept down the hall. In the first room, Sadie slept on the bed. I pulled the door shut and moved on to the room illuminated by a night-light. A gaggle of boy toys - a football, a bat, a deck of cards that appeared to have been the victim of fifty-two pickup - were strewn across the floor, as well as several dirty T-shirts and a dozen smelly socks. Luc lay on top of the covers, arms and legs flung apart with wild abandon. I let out the breath I\u0027d been holding in a rush and Luc\u0027s eyes snapped open. He must have been a real treat to get down for a nap as a baby. I put my finger to my lips, and he grinned as I hurried across the floor to kneel at his side. Before I could speak, he flung his arms around my neck and hugged me. What I wouldn\u0027t give to be able to trust like that. After this, I probably never would. \"We\u0027re going on a trip,\" I whispered. \"Do you have a suitcase?\" \"You and me and Daddy?\" he whispered back. \"Just you and me.\" \"Is that OK with Daddy?\" \"No,\" said a familiar voice from the door.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-35.html","bookId":2091,"book":{"id":2091,"title":"Night Creature: Crescent Moon (Nightcreature #4)","description":"Storyline: Crescent Moon(Night Creature series book 4) New Orleans is known for sinful pleasures and strange magic, but for cryptozoologist Diana Malone it offers one irresistible attraction.
