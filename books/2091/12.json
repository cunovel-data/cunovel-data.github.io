{"id":90075,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"I hadn\u0027t planned to fall asleep. Hadn\u0027t realized I had until the pounding woke me. \"Adam,\" I mumbled, too tired to consider why he would bother to knock on his own front door. He certainly hadn\u0027t last night The man standing on the porch couldn\u0027t have been more opposite of Adam Ruelle if I\u0027d created him myself. Six-foot-five and about 250, he had blond hair shorn close to his head. His muscles were big, his hands even bigger, and when he spoke I was reminded of home and not of hot sex, damp sheets, and jungle nights. \"Diana Malone?\" I blinked at his electric yellow tie, complete with a navy blue New Orleans Saints insignia. The sun sparked off his shiny shoes and straight into my brain. I grunted and walked away, leaving the door wide open. He took the gesture for the invitation it was and followed. The place was still trashed and I didn\u0027t bother to apologize. I hadn\u0027t done it. I also hadn\u0027t had time to do anything but get rid of the refuse. I\u0027d figured on using the better part of today on a little cleaning, but now I needed to drive to town, find a one-hour photo shop, then hit the library and do a little research. Though the Ruelle Mansion might appear to have come through a time warp from the Civil War, in truth the utilities had been updated in the last decade. However, the years of neglect had not been kind. The utilities weren\u0027t working. I\u0027d told Frank not to bother getting them fixed. I didn\u0027t want repairmen hanging around, asking questions, scaring away the wildlife. Besides, I\u0027d camped out in worse places than this. I tugged out my battery-operated coffeemaker and got down to business. \"I\u0027m Detective Conner Sullivan - New Orleans PD.\" I\u0027d already figured him for a cop. No one showed up this early in a suit and tie unless they were badge happy. What I couldn\u0027t figure out was what a guy like him was doing in a place like this. So I asked. \"Why is the New Orleans PD in St. Tammany Parish?\" I managed to get the coffee grounds into the proper container, then poured distilled water into the carafe and waited. I\u0027d learned a long time ago that shaking the thing only made a mess. It didn\u0027t make the coffee come out any faster. More\u0027s the pity. \"I\u0027m not squatting,\" I said when he didn\u0027t answer right away. \"I rented this place fair and square. Or my employer did.\" Sullivan stared at me for several seconds. His eyes were brown, which didn\u0027t seem right, but then, not every person of Irish descent possesses the blue or green gene. \"I\u0027m not here to roust you,\" he murmured. \"We don\u0027t usually send detectives for that.\" \"Good point.\" I picked up the coffeepot and lifted a brow in his direction. \"No thanks. I\u0027ve already had so much I might jump out of my skin.\" My lips twitched at the thought of this laconic man jumping anywhere over anything. I wondered if he were trying to make a joke, except he just kept staring at me with his curious cop eyes and flat, unsmiling mouth. Guess he was serious. I poured myself a cup, then sat on my sleeping bag, leaving the only chair, a foldout canvas model, for him. He ignored it, choosing to stroll around the room peering into corners. \"I know you rented the place,\" he said, \"but why?\" \"I\u0027m investigating reports of a wolf in the swamp.\" \"In Louisiana?\" He cast me a quick glance. \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"I\u0027ll find that out and be on my way.\" \"What do you know about Adam Ruelle?\" I bid my surprise behind a sip of coffee. Why was everyone so interested in him? \"According to the locals, he\u0027s dead.\" Sullivan turned quickly for such a big man. \"According to you, he isn\u0027t.\" Hmm. He\u0027d been busy this morning, checking my rental status, reading Cantrel and Hamilton\u0027s report. I slurped more coffee, took my time swallowing, then lowered the cup. \"A man who says he\u0027s Ruelle has been around.\" \"Where is he now?\" Good question. I had no idea where Adam lived. He just turned up wherever I was. Which was downright odd now that I thought about it. \"Why do you care?\" Sullivan kept his dark gaze on my face. \"A man was killed.\" \"Charlie. I know.\" \"Not him. Another man. Last night.\" The cup halfway to my lips again, I had to tighten my fingers quickly before I dropped it into my lap. \"Where?\" \"Not far from the incident with Charlie Wagner.\" I\u0027d sworn I\u0027d heard a growl, seen an animal, but what if I\u0027d killed a person? My hands started shaking, and coffee nearly cascaded over the edge of my cup. I set it on the floor as I took several deep breams and forced myself to mink. I\u0027d walked around, hadn\u0027t found anything. Not a person, not an animal, no blood. But it had been dark, and I wasn\u0027t Outdoor Girl no matter how much I liked to pretend that I was. \"Shot?\" I blurted. He gave me a strange look. An animal had killed the others. To know the man was shot - well, basically I\u0027d just confessed. Sighing, I ran through the names of everyone I knew. Not a lawyer among them. Hell. \"Not shot,\" Sullivan murmured. Since I\u0027d already fitted myself for a pair of handcuffs, my mind groped for meaning and quickly found one. \"Another animal attack?\" I started to get to my feet, intent on seeing the body, checking the tracks, but his next words had me sitting right back down. \"Strangulation.\" Now my mind was really groping. \"Strangled? How?\" \"Bare hands are the usual method.\" I blinked at the repetition of my own thoughts of the night before. Adam had given me his gun. He\u0027d had only his hands for protection. Had he used them? \"Fingerprints?\" I asked. \" \u0027Bare hands\u0027 was just a figure of speech. A rope was used. Probably gloves. Not much evidence.\" He took a deep breath. \"There\u0027ve been more disappearances than usual in and around New Orleans.\" I narrowed my eyes. \"And you\u0027re starting to think serial killer.\" His face went blank. \"I never said that.\" He hadn\u0027t said much, including what he was doing out of his parish. But I could figure it out. Tourists and locals disappearing, some of them turning up in the swamp. When St. Tammany police found a body, it was natural they\u0027d call the man in charge of the original case, see if their corpse matched any of his missing. \"Why do you want to talk to Adam?\" Sullivan lifted his brows at my use of a first name, but he didn\u0027t comment. \"Dead people keep turning up on his property.\" \"The others were killed by animals.\" \"True. But this one is murder, and despite what you see on television, strangling someone isn\u0027t easy. You have to be strong and you have to be quick. There\u0027s a bit of an art to it One someone like Ruelle would know.\" \"I heard he was in the Special Forces.\" \"He was in something,\" Sullivan muttered. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" \"There\u0027s a block on his file that requires higher security clearance than I have.\" \"Bummer,\" I muttered. Sullivan scowled. \"Do you know where he is or don\u0027t you?\" \"Don\u0027t,\" I answered with complete truthfulness. The detective stared at me for several seconds. His stoic glare probably worked on most people, but not on me. He hadn\u0027t spent eighteen years with my mother. \"Fine.\" He reached into his jacket, pulled out a card. \"If you see him, call me. Better yet, tell him to call. If he doesn\u0027t have anything to hide, we should be able to clear this right up.\" \"Uh-huh.\" Sullivan cut a glance in my direction, but I just smiled as if I hadn\u0027t been being sarcastic. \"Who was the victim?\" I asked as I walked Sullivan to the door. \"We don\u0027t know.\" \"Come on, Detective, the name\u0027s going to get out eventually.\" \"I hope so; then I\u0027d know it.\" He shook his head. \"This guy had no ID.\" \"Stolen?\u0027 \"Maybe. But his money clip was still in his pocket. His fingerprints didn\u0027t pop. There isn\u0027t a missing persons report that fits his description.\" \"If he\u0027s a tourist, it might take a while for anyone to notice he\u0027s gone.\" Sullivan seemed about to say something more, then tightened his lips and kept further comments to himself. Considering this was shaping up to be a murder investigation, I didn\u0027t blame him. \"If you think of anything that might be useful,\" he stepped onto the porch, \"let me know.\" With a nod, I shut the door. I probably should have told Sullivan I\u0027d been in the swamp last night, but I hadn\u0027t killed the guy and I hadn\u0027t seen anything. Except a wolf or something like one. A lie was a lie, even if it was by omission. However, I didn\u0027t want to be dragged downtown for questioning when I had an appointment with a one-hour photo shop. \"If mere\u0027s anything on that film that\u0027ll help, I\u0027ll take the picture directly to the police station.\" I put my hand over my heart. \"Swear.\" Since there was no one to hear my vow, it wasn\u0027t really binding, but I felt better anyway. I took a sponge bath, brushed my teeth in a bowl. I didn\u0027t mind camping, but the lack of a shower was a definite drawback. I\u0027d have to rent a cheap hotel room once, maybe twice, a week, or I wouldn\u0027t be able to stand myself. Grabbing the gun and my camera, two things I did not want to lose - though from the age of the garbage I\u0027d removed from the inside of the house, no one had stayed there for months - I went out the door. What could have spooked the homeless away from such a good flop spot? Had word gotten out that people were dying? I shivered despite the early-morning heat. Not for the first time I questioned the wisdom of remaining in the swamp alone. After tucking the pistol into the trunk with my computer, I headed for town. I probably should have unloaded the weapon - I wasn\u0027t exactly clear on the transportation-of-firearms rules around here - but the idea of having the bullets in one place, the gun in another, a rabid wolf or even a serial killer chasing me around and around and around... I decided I\u0027d take my chances with the police. I easily found a one-hour photo shop, dropped off the film, and headed to the library for a little research. This early in the morning the place was cool and deserted. Just the way I liked it A quick trip through the search engine netted me nothing. Unless the Ruelles had written a book or had one written about them, that usually didn\u0027t work, but it was always a good place to start My next stop was the desk of the reference librarian. When in doubt, ask questions. \"I\u0027m looking for information on a local family.\" Short, thin, ancient, with granny glasses, clunky shoes, and - wait for it - a shawl, the woman\u0027s nameplate read Mrs. Beasly. \"Oh! Are you researching your family tree?\" Since she seemed so excited about the prospect, I said, \"Sure.\" \"What\u0027s the name?\" \"Ruelle.\" Her bright, helpful smile faded. \"Oh, no, dear, you must be mistaken.\" \"Why\u0027s that?\" \"There hasn\u0027t been a female born to the Ruelles for at least a century.\" I didn\u0027t miss a beat. \"My connection is much older than that\" If I was going to lie, I might as well lie big. \"I see.\" Mrs. Beasly contemplated me over the top of her wire rims. I wondered if she\u0027d been an English teacher with a penchant for rulers before she\u0027d migrated to the library. I hid my knuckles behind my back and tried to appear angelic, always difficult with my devilishly red hair. \"Isn\u0027t that a bit strange?\" I asked. \"No females.\" \"That isn\u0027t the only thing.\" \"Oh, really?\" She glanced around as if someone might be listening, but we were still the only people in the library. To help her out, I leaned over the desk and craned my ear in a conspiratorial manner. \"The poor family,\" she whispered. \"It\u0027s as if they\u0027re cursed.\" Cursed? my mind mocked. As in... cursed to run as a wolf beneath the crescent moon? Couldn\u0027t be. Because I didn\u0027t believe in werewolves or curses. However, I didn\u0027t believe in coincidence, either. How many curses were there around here?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-12.html","bookId":2091,"book":{"id":2091,"title":"Night Creature: Crescent Moon (Nightcreature #4)","description":"Storyline: Crescent Moon(Night Creature series book 4) New Orleans is known for sinful pleasures and strange magic, but for cryptozoologist Diana Malone it offers one irresistible attraction.
