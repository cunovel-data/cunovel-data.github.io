I kind of thought she was. \"We\u0027ve been over this. Put the gun away.\"\\n\\n \"Never.\" But he did lower it. \"What do you suggest? A mad werewolf, soul or no, is not something I plan to let run free.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m with him,\" Adam said.\\n\\n Elise stared at Henri as if he were a brand-new science experiment. \"I wish I could cage him until I\u0027m certain what we\u0027re up against\"\\n\\n Adam and I exchanged glances.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a cage,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d forgotten,\" Mandenauer murmured, and Elise shot him a glare.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not something that should be forgotten.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ancient.\" He sniffed. \"Sometimes I forget.\"\\n\\n \"One day you\u0027ll forget to shoot the bad guys, and then you\u0027ll be dead.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps.\" He didn\u0027t appear concerned. \"We must hurry and incarcerate Henri before the sun disappears.\"\\n\\n A flurry of activity ensued, followed by a frantic trip to the mansion; then we practically dragged Henri through the swamp, and tossed him into the cage.\\n\\n Not a minute too soon.\\n\\n I turned the key on the padlock as he came awake with a howl of agony. His body bent; his clothes tore; hair sprouted from every pore. I\u0027d seen him change from wolf to man; now I watched as he went from man to wolf. That had to hurt.\\n\\n His too human eyes peered at us from behind the bars. When I\u0027d seen them before they\u0027d been full of hate and hunger. Now the hunger was there, but the hate was gone.\\n\\n He paced back and forth, whining, pawing the ground, then throwing himself against the bars until he bled.\\n\\n \"Give him the serum, Elise,\" Mandenauer ordered.\\n\\n She\u0027d already pulled a vial from the pocket of her shorts and snapped gloves onto her hands once more. Another migraine she didn\u0027t need.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s de matter with him?\"\\n\\n \"The hunger is maddening. On the night of the full moon I have to run as wolf. Without this,\" she held up the vial \"I\u0027d kill. I wouldn\u0027t be able to help myself. For him, the same thing must happen under the crescent moon.\" She shook her head. \"One night a month is bad enough.\"\\n\\n \"Why is he whining?\" I resisted the urge to cover my ears, the pathetic noise grating on my nerves like sandpaper.\\n\\n \"Killing sickens him,\" she whispered, \"but he can\u0027t resist the desire.\"\\n\\n Elise walked to the cage, and Henri slammed against it right in front of her.\\n\\n \"Be careful,\" I called.\\n\\n \"He can\u0027t hurt me. I\u0027m a werewolf already.\"\\n\\n In a lightning-fast movement, she reached inside and grabbed Henri\u0027s snout. Then she poured the contents of the vial down his throat. When she was through, he actually licked her hand before falling asleep.\\n\\n \"Does Damien still get furry every full moon?\" I asked Elise.\\n\\n \"My touch cured him.\"\\n\\n \"But you can\u0027t cure yourself?\"\\n\\n Something flickered in her eyes, and she looked away. \"Not yet\"\\n\\n \"And Henri? What\u0027s his problem?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027d like to take him back to the lab and figure that out.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Adam said flatly.\\n\\n \"I can fix him,\" Elise insisted. \"I haven\u0027t spent much time in the lab since this.\" She lifted her palm. \"Works better than any medicine. But not so long ago, I lived there. I\u0027m sure I can discover what his secret is.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t kill him. If he dies, I\u0027m cursed.\"\\n\\n \"The curse might be lifted. His soul is restored.\"\\n\\n \"De only way to know is for him to die. I\u0027m not willing to take that chance.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be safe with me. You should see the compound we built Impregnable this time.\"\\n\\n \"This time?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Last one went boom. But the werewolves survived the blast.\"\\n\\n \"That really sets my mind at ease,\" Adam muttered.\\n\\n Cassandra, who hadn\u0027t said a word since we\u0027d gotten here, moved closer to the cage. \"I think I might know why your cure didn\u0027t work.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m all ears,\" Elise said.\\n\\n \"Henri was made a loup-garou through voodoo, not by science or by being bitten.\" Cassandra stared at each of us in turn. \"A voodoo curse can only be removed by voodoo.\"\\n\\n My heart kicked against the wall of my chest. \"You can fix him? Why didn\u0027t you say so?\"\\n\\n \"Not me.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n \"Only the one who placed the curse can take it away.\"\\n\\n My shoulders slumped. \"She\u0027s gotta be long dead.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\" Cassandra\u0027s eyes met mine. \"But the dead can rise.\"\\n\\n \"Zombie.\"\\n\\n Elise\u0027s eyebrows shot toward her silky blond hair. I was amazed that in her profession she could still be surprised.\\n\\n \"Zombies are dangerous,\" Mandenauer muttered. \"And unpredictable.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve seen one?\" Cassandra asked.\\n\\n \"Ja.\"\\n\\n \"You know someone who can raise a zombie?\"\\n\\n \"I did.\" He sniffed.\\n\\n \"That means he killed the guy,\" Elise said. \"Grandfather, sometimes it\u0027s better to keep them alive.\"\\n\\n \"Wait a second.\" I held up a hand. \"He\u0027s your grandfather?\"\\n\\n That the head werewolf hunter had a granddaughter who was a werewolf was a little hard to digest.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Elise confirmed. \"Neither one of us is too happy about it.\"\\n\\n I could imagine.\\n\\n Adam turned to Cassandra. \"Tell me about raising de woman who cursed my family. Could you do it?\"\\n\\n \"Not me, no. I\u0027d need to find a practitioner powerful enough to perform that kind of magic. I\u0027m not even sure it\u0027s possible to raise someone who\u0027s been dead that long.\"\\n\\n Adam\u0027s shoulders slumped. I moved closer and slipped my hand into his.\\n\\n \"Until then, let me try,\" Elise urged.\\n\\n I understood why Adam didn\u0027t want to give anyone power over Henri. In relinquishing his grandpere, Adam relinquished control over his own and Luc\u0027s destiny. But we\u0027d exhausted our options. Protecting Henri wasn\u0027t getting us anywhere. We needed the experts\u0027 help.\\n\\n Adam must have thought the same thing, because he squeezed my hand and said, \"OK.\"\\n\\n The night passed; the sun rose; Henri became a man again. A very crazy man.\\n\\n Elise was forced to sedate him to get him back to the compound in Montana. She\u0027d been right. The knowledge of all he\u0027d done had sent him over the edge. He did a lot of moaning and muttering. If I hadn\u0027t almost been one of his victims, I might have felt sorry for him. As it was, I was glad to see him go.\\n\\n Cassandra decided to take a trip to Haiti, courtesy of the Jager-Sucher society.\\n\\n \"Mandenauer wants me to discover more about voodoo, zombies, and this goddess-of-the-moon question. I\u0027m game.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d hired a local to run her store and take care of Lazarus when I refused to. Cassandra and I were friends, but I drew the line at snake-sitting.\\n\\n \"I think we\u0027ve proved I\u0027m not a moon goddess,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Maybe. Maybe not. It won\u0027t hurt to look into things a little more. You want Henri cured, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"For all I care, Henri can burn in hell.\"\\n\\n \"He probably will. But if we can make certain Adam and Luc don\u0027t follow him there - \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do anything,\" I said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I thought I made a few calls after you traveled to Ife and spoke to Erzulie.\"\\n\\n \"Do not tell me I\u0027m a lost priestess of the voodoo nation. I\u0027m a cryptozoologist from Boston. Period.\"\\n\\n Cassandra\u0027s shoulders shifted, as if something were crawling down her neck. \"I think I sent you to Ife.\"\\n\\n \"What?\u0027\\n\\n \"I performed the ceremony. The magic came from me.\" Cassandra appeared sheepish. \"I might be more powerful than I thought\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good news, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell Mandenauer. He gets weird when people talk about power.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t imagine why.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s next for you?\" Cassandra asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n She tilted her head. \"Love, marriage, mommyhood. I see it in the cards.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t read cards.\"\\n\\n She put her hand over mine. \"Your future is with them.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t seen Adam or Luc since Henri went away.\"\\n\\n Three days ago. I\u0027d hung around the mansion waiting. Pathetic but true. I\u0027d have to get a job soon, considering Frank hadn\u0027t paid me. Since his butt was in jail, courtesy of me, I didn\u0027t mink he was going to.\\n\\n Before Mandenauer had left he\u0027d told Detective Sullivan there\u0027d been one rabid wolf in the swamp and he had killed it. Case closed. I had no reason to hang around.\\n\\n \"Adam loves you,\" Cassandra said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure.\"\\n\\n \"He put his son in your protection. There\u0027s no greater love than that.\"\\n\\n \"Henri found a gris-gris under Luc\u0027s pillow.\"\\n\\n \"Really? I guess that\u0027s the love charm you were so worried about.\" She narrowed her gaze. \"You want me to give you one to counteract the magic?\"\\n\\n \"He burned it.\"\\n\\n She peered into my face. \"And you still love them both, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Desperately.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d realized sometime over the past few nights I\u0027d slept alone that I\u0027d fallen for Adam before I\u0027d even met Luc. The gris-gris was irrelevant, even if it weren\u0027t dust.\\n\\n \"Maybe you need to say good-bye to your first love before you move on to the last one.\"\\n\\n At my confused expression, she continued. \"Simon. You\u0027ve never really put him to rest\"\\n\\n \"And how do you suggest I do that? Another gris-gris?\"\\n\\n She smiled and squeezed my hand. \"Only you can say good-bye to him, Diana.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure how I\u0027d say good-bye to a dead man, but I certainly couldn\u0027t do it long-distance.\\n\\n I packed my things and went to Chicago, where I\u0027d buried Simon four years ago. The place no longer felt like home. I\u0027m not sure it ever had.\\n\\n The cemetery was peaceful, deserted. No one would see me talking to a headstone.\\n\\n \"You were right, Simon. There\u0027s more in this world than anyone could imagine.\"\\n\\n I sat on the grave and ran my hand over the grass. \"I had to break my vow, and I\u0027m sorry. I couldn\u0027t clear your name. I\u0027d only hurt more people. I figured you\u0027d understand.\"\\n\\n Absently I pulled out the gris-gris that contained the fire iris petal. A little truth wouldn\u0027t be so bad. Where was Simon now? Had he truly come to me in the swamp? Was there any way of getting him back? Did I want to?\\n\\n When I touched the sack, the tie fell off, and when I peered inside, I discovered the petal had disintegrated into dust The wind swirled the particles away.\\n\\n I guess some truths are better left unknown.\\n\\n \"I still miss you,\" I said. \"I probably always will, but I have to say good-bye.\"\\n\\n The breeze, warm despite the autumn chill off Lake Michigan, stirred my hair. I wanted to smell Simon\u0027s aftershave, hear his voice, feel his love, know that he\u0027d heard me. I closed my eyes and wished for him, but he was as gone as the wind.\\n\\n When I opened my eyes, Adam was there. Talk about magic.\\n\\n \"You scared me to death, cher. I thought you\u0027d left for good.\"\\n\\n How had he found me?\\n\\n \"Cassandra,\" I said as I got to my feet.\\n\\n He shrugged, then indicated Simon\u0027s grave with a tilt of his head. \"You were saying good-bye.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t live in the past anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Me, neither.\"\\n\\n Hope lit my heart and probably my face, because he held up his hand. \"There\u0027s something I have to tell you. Luc and Sadie did a love spell.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n He started. \"You do?\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \"I was going to destroy it, but Luc can\u0027t find de gris-gris.\"\\n\\n \"Henri burned it. One of his insane little mind games.\"\\n\\n \"But... I still feel de same way.\"\\n\\n \"Which is?\"\\n\\n \"Crazy mad in love with you.\"\\n\\n \"Ditto,\" I said. \"And your little boy, too.\"\\n\\n Adam gave me a rare smile. \"I never thought I\u0027d love anyone but my son.\"\\n\\n \"I never thought I\u0027d love again.\"\\n\\n \"I guess we were both wrong.\" He tugged on my hair. \"What you think about fixing up de mansion?\"\\n\\n \"I thought you hated the place.\"\\n\\n \"Kind of grew on me. Lots of good memories there now.\"\\n\\n My face heated at some of them.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t promise a certain future.\"\\n\\n I lowered my gaze to Simon\u0027s headstone. \"Who can?\"\\n\\n After several moments of silence, Adam said, \"Mandenauer offered us jobs.\"\\n\\n \"Us?\u0027\\n\\n He nodded. \"We\u0027d be perfect.\"\\n\\n \"What would we have to do?\"\\n\\n \"Same thing we\u0027ve been doing.\"\\n\\n I wiggled my brows. \"He\u0027s going to pay us for that?\"\\n\\n Adam snorted. \"He wants you to chase down rumors of paranormal beasts. He wants me to kill werewolves.\"\\n\\n I frowned. \"That sounds dangerous.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been doing it for years, cher\"\\n\\n \"What about Luc? We can\u0027t both traipse off, tra-la-la.\"\\n\\n His lips curved. \"You\u0027re thinkin\u0027 like a mother already.\"\\n\\n I was. When had that happened?\\n\\n \"You sure you want a ready-made family?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure I want you and Luc.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027ll be no more children.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be lucky if I can handle the one we have.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll do fine,\" he said. \"The boy was crazy about you from day one. That\u0027s why he did de love spell. Couldn\u0027t bear to lose you. I have to say I understand why, but he\u0027s still grounded.\"\\n\\n I stifled a laugh at the notion of being grounded for performing a voodoo love spell. My life certainly had taken a turn for the strange.\\n\\n \"I figure if we take Mandenauer\u0027s offer we can take turns bein\u0027 away from home.\"\\n\\n \"Home,\" I murmured. \"That sounds nice.\"\\n\\n Adam reached into his pocket For an instant I thought he\u0027d brought another belly chain. I still wore the one he\u0027d given me. I planned never to take it off.\\n\\n \"Partners?\" he asked, and held out his hand.\\n\\n In his palm lay a circlet of interlinked silver fleurs-de-lis with a moonstone center. The ring was so beautiful, I ached to put it on. But not yet\\n\\n \"When you say partners...?\u0027\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll understand if you don\u0027t want to marry me. Who knows when I might change under de crescent moon?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d still love you, even then.\"\\n\\n He just shook his head.\\n\\n \"The only way I\u0027ll do this is if we\u0027re married,\" I insisted. \"I adopt Luc. I\u0027ll protect him if you can\u0027t Once that\u0027s settled, we take the jobs, help save the world. Together, we\u0027ll face whatever comes.\"\\n\\n He hesitated so long, I feared he\u0027d take back the offer and the ring. At last he slipped the silver circlet onto my finger, sealing the deal without saying a word.\\n\\n But there was one thing that still bugged me.\\n\\n \"Did you really believe everything that was between us was the result of magic?\"\\n\\n \"I still believe that.\"\\n\\n My startled gaze flicked to his. \"What?\"\\n\\n Reaching out, he touched my cheek. \"Don\u0027t it feel like magic to you, cher?\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t speak, could only nod, as he took my hand, then led me away from my past and into a bright new future. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-41.html","bookId":2091,"book":{"id":2091,"title":"Night Creature: Crescent Moon (Nightcreature #4)","description":"Storyline: Crescent Moon(Night Creature series book 4) \\n New Orleans is known for sinful pleasures and strange magic, but for cryptozoologist Diana Malone it offers one irresistible attraction.
