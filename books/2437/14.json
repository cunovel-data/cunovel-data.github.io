Did you call out? Did you call His Name, Harry, into the void?\\n\\n It was M\u0026ouml;bius, but the waft and whisper of his dead-speak voice told the Necroscope that he was just as mazed and wandering as ever. \u0027His name?\u0027 Harry mumbled, still tossing and turning in his sticky sheets but gradually settling down again. \u0027Your name, do you mean? Probably. But that was earlier.\u0027\\n\\n No, His Name! M\u0026ouml;bius insisted.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\u0027 Harry was bewildered.\\n\\n Ah! M\u0026ouml;bius sighed, partly in relief but mainly in disappointment. But I thought for a moment that you had reached a similiar conclusion. Not at all impossible, nor even improbable. For as you know, I\u0027ve always considered you my peer, Harry.\\n\\n He still wasn\u0027t making much sense, but Harry didn\u0027t like to tell him so. His respect for M\u0026ouml;bius was limitless. \u0027Your peer?\u0027 he finally answered. \u0027Hardly that, sir. And whatever new conclusion you\u0027ve reached, no way that I could ever match it. Not any more, for I\u0027m not the man I used to be. Which is the reason I was looking for you.\u0027\\n\\n Ah, yes! I remember now: something about losing your deadspeak? Something about being innumerate? Well, as for the former, obviously not-for how else would you be speaking to me right now? And innumerate? What, Harry Keogh? M\u0026ouml;bius chuckled. That is not how I would describe you!\\n\\n Harry\u0027s turn to sigh his relief. M\u0026ouml;bius\u0027s mind, at first misty, was at last coming through to him with something of its usual crystal clarity. He pressed his case:\\n\\n \u0027But that\u0027s just it: it\u0027s the only way to describe what\u0027s happened to me. I am now innumerate; I can\u0027t conjure the equations; I no longer have access to the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. And I need the Continuum now as never before.\u0027\\n\\n Innumerate! the other said yet again, plainly astonished. But how may I accept it? How may I believe it of you? You were my star pupil! Here, try this: and he inscribed a complicated mathematical sequence on the screen of Harry\u0027s mind.\\n\\n Harry looked at it, examining each symbol and number in turn, and it was like trying to fathom an alien language. \u0027No use,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Astonishing! M\u0026ouml;bius cried. That was a very simple problem, Harry. It appears this disability of yours is serious.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been saying,\u0027 Harry tried to be patient. \u0027And it\u0027s why I need your help.\u0027\\n\\n Only tell me what you would like me to do.\\n\\n Now Harry\u0027s sigh was a glad one, for it seemed that at last he had M\u0026ouml;bius\u0027s total attention. He quickly told him how Faethor had got into his mind and untangled the connections he\u0027d found there, which had been stimulated into agonizing being each time Harry had attempted to use his deadspeak.\\n\\n \u0027Faethor was probably the only one who could ever have corrected it,\u0027 he explained, \u0027because it was one of his own sort who\u0027d snarled it up in the first place. And so I got my deadspeak back. But that wasn\u0027t the only obstruction Faethor found in there, not by a long shot. The areas governing my basic and instinctive understanding of numbers had been closed off almost entirely. Here\u0027s what he discovered: closed doors, barred and bolted -with all my maths locked up behind them. Now Faethor is no mathematician, but still, by sheer force of will he got one of these doors open. Only for a moment, before it slammed shut again, but long enough. And beyond it... the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum! That was too much for him and he got out of there.\u0027\\n\\n Entirely fascinating! said M\u0026ouml;bius. And: It seems we\u0027ll have to start your education all over again.\\n\\n Harry groaned. \u0027That isn\u0027t quite the way I see it,\u0027 he said. \u0027I mean, I was hoping there\u0027d be a much quicker way. You see, this is something I need right now, or I\u0027m very likely a goner. What I mean is, well, Faethor could only handle those areas in which he was the expert. And so I was thinking that maybe you -\u0027\\n\\n But Harry, M\u0026ouml;bius seemed shocked, I\u0027m no vampire! Your mind is your own, private and inviolable, and -\\n\\n \u0027But not for much longer,\u0027 Harry cut him off. \u0027Not if you turn me down!\u0027 And desperately now: \u0027August Ferdinand, I have to go up against something entirely monstrous, and I need all the help I can get. But it\u0027s not just for me, it\u0027s for everyone and everything. For you see, if I lose this one, then my enemy gets it all - even the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum itself! Believe me, I\u0027m not exaggerating. If you can\u0027t open those doors in my head, he will. And... and... and after that -\u0027 Yes?\\n\\n \u0027 - After that, I just don\u0027t know.\u0027 M\u0026ouml;bius was silent for a moment, and then: That serious, eh?\\n\\n That serious, yes.\u0027\\n\\n But Harry, all your secrets are in there, your ambitions, your most private thoughts.\\n\\n \u0027Also my desires, my vices, my sins. But it\u0027s no peep-show, August. You don\u0027t have to look where you don\u0027t want to.\u0027\\n\\n The other sighed his acquiescence. Very well. How do we go about it?\\n\\n Harry was eager now. \u0027August Ferdinand, you\u0027re the one man among all the dead who can go anywhere -literally anywhere - in three-dimensional space. You\u0027ve been out to the stars, down to the bed of the deepest ocean. Through your knowledge of the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum, you\u0027ve thrown off the fetters of the grave. So ... how we go about it is simple. I hope so, anyway. I\u0027m going to clear my mind and drift in sleep, and simply invite you in. I\u0027m going to say: M\u0026ouml;bius, come into my mind. Enter, of your own free will, and do whatever is necessary to...\u0027\\n\\n AHHH! came the black, gurglingly glutinous, utterly overpowering voice of Janos Ferenczy in Harry\u0027s mind. BUT SUCH AN ELOQUENT INVITATION. NEVER LET IT BE SAID THAT I WAS THE ONE TO REFUSE YOU!\\n\\n M\u0026ouml;bius and his deadspeak were swept aside on the instant. Harry, paralysed, could do nothing. He felt the Ferenczy step inside his head as a fish feels the lamprey\u0027s clamps in its gill, and was likewise impotent to stop it. It was as if some nameless slug had oozed in through his ear to eat his brain, and was now stretching itself luxuriously before commencing the feast. He tried to bring down the shutters of his mind but they were stuck, effortlessly held open by the invader.\\n\\n OH? said Janos, as yet feeling his way, enjoying the horror of his host. AND DID I FEEL YOU CRINGE JUST THEN? COULD IT BE THAT YOU ATTEMPTED TO EVICT ME? AND WAS THAT A MEASURE OF YOUR STRENGTH? IF SO, THEN I\u0027VE PRECIOUS LITTLE TO FEAR HERE! BUT FOR SHAME, HARRY KEOGH! WOULD YOU INVITE ME IN AND AS QUICKLY THROW ME OUT? AND WHAT SORT OF A HOST ARE YOU?\\n\\n \u0027My... invitation... wasn\u0027t to you!\u0027 Harry forced his brain into gear, tried to remind himself that this was just another vampire. Janos settled on the thought like a vulture to carrion:\\n\\n I WAS NOT INVITED? BUT YOUR MIND WAS OPEN AS A WHORE\u0027S CROTCH - AND JUST AS TEMPTING!\\n\\n Something of Harry\u0027s horror receded; he tightened his grip on himself, forced his feverish mind into what he hoped was a defensive stance. But he could almost smell the vampire\u0027s vile breath and feel his stealthy tread in the corridors of his most secret being.\\n\\n AND STILL YOU ACCUSE ME OF STENCHES! the invader laughed. WHAT WAS IT YOU LIKENED ME TO THE LAST TIME? A DEAD PIG? YOU OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW BETTER, FOR I AM UNDEAD...\\n\\n Suddenly Harry was cool. He had felt stifled but now it was as if someone had thrown open a window to blow out all the cobwebs of his mind. He filled his lungs with the rush of this weird, conjectural ether and felt stronger for it. And from a far more buoyant if mysterious viewpoint, he wondered at the audacity of the vampire that he should feel so safe and secure as to be able to just... just walk in here.\\n\\n All of these most recent thoughts were guarded, so that Janos took Harry\u0027s silence as an indication of sheer terror. AND SO THIS IS THE MIGHTY NECROSCOPE, said the vampire. AND HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE MY \u0027FILTHY LEECH\u0027S MIND\u0027 IN YOUR HEAD, HARRY?\\n\\n Harry continued to guard his thoughts. It wasn\u0027t difficult; it was like deadspeak, where with a small effort of concentration the dead heard only what he required them to hear. And again he felt a peculiar surge of confidence which was surely well out of place here. For, asleep and dreaming, he couldn\u0027t exert half as much control over his mind as when he was awake. However true that might be, still he sensed that Janos was becoming just a fraction more cautious.\\n\\n YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT I CAN BEND YOU TO MY WILL JUST AS I BENT - AND BROKE - THAT FOOL JORDAN? But was Janos stating a fact, or was he asking himself a question?\\n\\n \u0027Keep telling yourself that,\u0027 said Harry, without emotion. \u0027But remember: you entered of your own free will.\u0027\\n\\n WHAT? And now there was a ragged, worried edge to Janos\u0027s thoughts. As if for the first time he might be weighing the issues and considering his position here.\\n\\n And in the back of Harry\u0027s mind, unsuspected by Janos, it was as if he heard Faethor advising him again, as he had in the ruins of his house outside Ploiesti:\\n\\n Instead of shrinking back from him when you sense him near, seek him out! He would enter your mind? Enter his! He will expect you to be afraid; be bold! He will threaten; brush all such threats aside and strike! But above all else, do not let his evil weaken you. And, finally: There may be more to your mind than even you suspect, Harry...\\n\\n Janos was beginning to think so too. THIS MIND OF YOURS IS ... DIFFERENT FROM THE MINDS OF OTHER MEN. IT WILL GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE TO EXPLORE IT. AND IT WILL GIVE YOU GREAT PAIN!\\n\\n \u0027Well, at least you have the vanity of the Wamphyri,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027But what is vanity without the means to match it?\u0027\\n\\n YOU KNOW US ... WELL, said Janos, edgier than ever. PERHAPS TOO WELL.\\n\\n \u0027Having second thoughts, my son?\u0027\\n\\n And again, but angrily: WHAT?!\\n\\n \u0027Come now, not so nervous. I speak more as an uncle than a true father. But it\u0027s a fact I do have a son of my own. Except, of course, he is Wamphyri! But see, now I sense your trembling. What, you afraid? How so? For after all you have my measure. Have you not invaded my mind? Where is my resistance? With what may I resist? Here you are inside the castle of my very being. Ah, but there are castles and there are castles - and some are easier to get into than they are to get out of!\u0027 And at last Harry brought the shutters of his mind crashing down.\\n\\n Janos was confused; this was no mere man; it was as if he talked to ... something far greater than a man. In his panic, so the vampire became vicious:\\n\\n THESE PUNY BARRIERS YOU HAVE ERECTED ... I AM SURROUNDED BY DOORS. BUT I HAVE THE STRENGTH TO BEAT THEM ALL DOWN, INDEED TO TEAR THEM FROM THEIR HINGES!\\n\\n Harry heard him, but he also heard this:\\n\\n When he yawns his great jaws at you, go in through them, for he\u0027s softer on the inside!\\n\\n \u0027Beat them all down, then,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Tear them from their hinges - if you dare!\u0027\\n\\n Janos dared. He ran through Harry\u0027s mind shattering every barrier the Necroscope could put in his way, tearing down the shutters and screens on his Innermost Being. All Harry\u0027s past was there, his loves and hates, his hopes and aspirations, and all trampled under as the vampire marauded through previously secret corridors of id. In any one of these places the monster might pause a while, play, cause Harry to laugh, cry, scream - or die. But realizing now that indeed he had Harry\u0027s measure, he didn\u0027t pause but rampaged. And:\\n\\n WHAT? WHAT? he finally laughed, as he came to a place more heavily fortified than all the rest put together. WHY, IT CAN ONLY BE THE VERY TREASURE HOUSE! AND WHAT MARVELLOUS SECRETS ARE STORED HERE, HARRY KEOGH? ARE THESE THE VAULTS OF YOUR TALENTS?\\n\\n And before Harry could answer - if he would answer -Janos had wrenched two of the doors open.\\n\\n Beyond one of them was the ultimate NOTHING, so that in a single moment Janos found himself teetering on the threshold of the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. And behind the other... was Faethor Ferenczy, crouching there where he directed Harry\u0027s game, and now inspired Janos\u0027s uttermost terror!\\n\\n The invader reared back - from Faethor, who had now emerged more fully from his hiding place and was frantically trying to push him through the doorway to eternity, and from the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum both - and grunted his shock, astonishment and total disbelief. For within a mainly human identity he had stumbled across not only an Unknowable and terrifying concept, but also the entirely monstrous and alien mind of his own long-dead father!\\n\\n Terror galvanized him: he tore himself free from Faethor, gasped a stream of semi-coherent obscenities at him, and fled. He broke out of Harry\u0027s id, was gone in a moment. He had done no real damage, and the Necroscope guessed that he\u0027d never dare try it again. But -\\n\\n \u0027Faethor!\u0027 Harry growled, his mental voice as grim and wrenching as an old chalk on a new blackboard - his own voice now, no longer influenced or guided by the mind of his secret tenant. And again: \u0027Faethor!\u0027\\n\\n There was no answer, except perhaps a far, faint chuckle, like oily bubbles bursting on a lake of pitch. Or perhaps the furtive whir of bat-wings, echoing from the deepest, darkest cave.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, you bastard... you liar!\u0027 Harry howled. \u0027You\u0027re in here! You have been right from the moment I let you in! But I can find you, throw you out...\u0027\\n\\n And at last:\\n\\n No need, my son, came Faethor\u0027s distant, diseased whisper. The first battle is fought and won; the sun rises; I... get... me ... gone!\\n\\n After that: Harry surfaced from his dreams slow and cold, so that the sweat was dry on him by the time he was fully awake and Darcy Clarke came knocking on his door mumbling about breakfast. By then, too, Harry believed he\u0027d worked out how he was going to play the rest of it\\n\\n At 8:15 Rhodes Town was only just awake, but already Harry was down on a pier in Mandraki harbour to see his friends off. Darcy and Manolis waved several times as their boat pulled out onto the incredible blue millpond of the Aegean, but he didn\u0027t wave back. He simply nodded and watched them out of sight, and silently wished them luck.\\n\\n Then he drove over to the beach at Kritika and swam for an hour before returning to the hotel and showering. Even after furiously towelling himself dry, and despite the fact that it was at least seventy-five degrees out in the sun, he was still cold. The coldness he felt had nothing to do with the outside temperature. It came from inside.\\n\\n Harry\u0027s bed had been freshly made; he lay on it with his hands behind his head and thought a while, slowly emptying his mind and letting himself drift...\\n\\n ... Then made a stab at Faethor!\\n\\n And caught him there in his mind before he could wriggle down out of sight. Faethor, right there in his mind, and the time just a little after 10:30, and a scorching sun standing high in the sky. So much for the sun as a deterrent. Harry should have known: ghosts don\u0027t burn. It might give Faethor a few bad dreams but it couldn\u0027t physically hurt him because there was nothing physical left of him. Any of Harry\u0027s dead friends could have told him that much.\\n\\n \u0027You old devil!\u0027 he said, but coldly, for he wasn\u0027t name-calling, just stating a fact. \u0027You old bastard, you old liar. So just like Thibor fastened on Dragosani, you\u0027re thinking of latching on to me, eh?\u0027\\n\\n Thinking of it? Faethor came into the open, and Harry could feel him as close as if he stood right there at his bedside. Fait accompli, Harry. Get used to it.\\n\\n Harry shook his head and grinned mirthlessly. \u0027I will be rid of you,\u0027 he said. \u0027Believe me, Faethor, I\u0027ll be rid of you, even if it means getting rid of myself.\u0027\\n\\n Suicide? Faethor tut-tutted. No, not you, Harry. Why, you are tenacious as the ones you hunt down and destroy! You will not kill yourself while there\u0027s still a chance to kill another one of them.\\n\\n \u0027Another one of you, you mean? But you could be wrong, Faethor. Me, I\u0027m only human. I\u0027d die pretty easily. A bullet through my brain, like Trevor Jordan... I wouldn\u0027t even know about it. Believe me, it\u0027s tempting.\u0027\\n\\n I see no real notion of suicide in your thoughts, Faethor shrugged, so why pretend? Do you think I feel threatened? How can you threaten me, Harry? I\u0027m already dead!\\n\\n \u0027But in me you have life, right? Listen and I\u0027ll tell you something: you really don\u0027t know what\u0027s in my thoughts. I can hide them, even from you. It\u0027s deadspeak; that\u0027s how I learned to do it; by keeping back my thoughts from the dead. I did it then so as not to hurt them, but I can just as easily use it the other way.\u0027\\n\\n For a moment - the merest tick of the clock - Harry felt Faethor wavering. And he nodded knowingly. \u0027See? I know what\u0027s on your mind, old devil. But do you know what\u0027s on mine, if I hide it from you... so?\u0027\\n\\n Deep in the psyche of Harry, the Father of Vampires felt himself surrounded by nothing. It fell on him like a blanket, as if to smother him. It was as if he were back in the earth near Ploiesti, where his evil fats had been rendered down the night Ladislau Giresci took his life.\\n\\n \u0027You see,\u0027 Harry told him, letting the light of his thoughts shine in again, \u0027I can shut you out.\u0027\\n\\n Not out, Harry. You can only shut me off. But the moment you relax I\u0027ll be back.\\n\\n \u0027Always?\u0027\\n\\n For a moment Faethor was silent. Then: No, for we made a bargain. And so long as you hold to it, then so shall I. When Janos is no more, then you\u0027ll be rid of me.\\n\\n \u0027You swear it?\u0027\\n\\n Upon my soul! Faethor gurgled like a night-dark swamp, and smiled an immaterial smile.\\n\\n It was the natural sarcasm of the vampire, but Harry only said: Til hold you to that.\u0027 And his mental voice was cold as the spaces between the stars. \u0027Just remember, Faethor, I\u0027ll hold you to it...\u0027\\n\\n Manolis handled the boat. It had a small cabin and a large engine, and left a wake like low white walls melting back into the blue. Always in sight of land, they had rounded Cape Koumbourno and outpaced the water-skiers off Kritika Beach before Harry had even hit the water there. By 9:00 a.m. they had passed Cape Minas, and with the mainland lying to port were heading for Alimnia. Darcy had thought he might have trouble with his stomach, but the sea was like glass and with the wind in his face ... he might easily be enjoying an expensive holiday. That is, if he wasn\u0027t perfectly sure he was heading for horror.\\n\\n Around 10:00 a pair of dolphins played chicken across the prow of the boat where it sliced the water; by which time they\u0027d passed between the almost barren rocks of Alimnia and Makri, and Halki (which Manolis insisted should be \u0027Khalki\u0027, for the chalky shells it was named after) had swum into view.\\n\\n Fifteen minutes later they were into the harbour and tied up, and Manolis was chatting with a pair of weathered fishermen where they mended their nets. While he made his apparently casual inquiries, Darcy bought a map from a tiny box of a shop right on the waterfront and studied what he could of the island\u0027s layout. There wasn\u0027t a great deal to study.\\n\\n The island was a big rock something less than eight by four miles, with the long axis lying east to west. Looking west a mile or two, mountain crests stood wild and desolate where the island\u0027s one road of any description wandered apparently aimlessly. And Darcy knew that his and Manolis\u0027s destination lay way up there, in the heights at the end of that road. He didn\u0027t need the map to know it: his talent had been telling him ever since he stepped from the boat to dry land.\\n\\n Eventually, done with talking to the fishermen, Manolis joined him. \u0027No transport,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is maybe two miles, then the climbing, and of course we will be carrying our - how do you say - picnic basket? It looks like a long hot walk, my friend, and all of it uphill.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy looked around. \u0027Well, what\u0027s that,\u0027 he said, \u0027if not transport?\u0027 A three-wheeled device, clattering like a steam-engine and pulling a four-wheel cart, came clanking out of a narrow street to park in the \u0027centre of town\u0027, that being the waterfront with its bars and tavernas.\\n\\n The driver was a slim, small Greek of about forty-five; he got down from his driver\u0027s seat and went into a grocery store. Darcy and Manolis were waiting for him when he came out. His name was Nikos; he owned a taverna and rooms on a beach across the bottleneck of the promontory behind the town; business was slow right now and he could run them up to the end of the road for a small remuneration. When Manolis mentioned a sum of fifteen hundred drachmae his eyes lit up like lamps, and after he\u0027d collected his fish, groceries, booze and other items for the taverna, then they were off.\\n\\n Sitting in the back of the cart had to be better than walking - but not much better. On the way Nikos stopped to unload his purchases at the taverna, and to open a couple of bottles of beer for his passengers, and then the journey continued.\\n\\n After a little while and when he\u0027d adjusted his position against the jolting, Darcy took a swig of his beer and said: \u0027What did you find out?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There are two of them,\u0027 Manolis answered. \u0027They come down at evening to buy meat - red meat, no fish - and maybe drink a bottle of wine. They stay together, don\u0027t talk much, do their own cooking up at the site... if they cook!\u0027 He shrugged and looked narrow-eyed at Darcy. \u0027They work mainly at night; when the wind is in the right direction the villagers occasionally hear them blasting. Nothing big, just small charges to shift the rocks and the rubble. During the day... they are not seen to do too much. They laze around in the caves up there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about the tourists?\u0027 Darcy inquired. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t they be a nuisance? And how come Lazarides - or Janos - gets away with it? I mean, digging in these ruins? Is your government crazy or something? This is ... it\u0027s history!\u0027\\n\\n Again Manolis\u0027s shrug. \u0027The Vrykoulakas apparently has his friends. Anyway, they are not actually digging in the ruins. Beyond the castle where it sits up on the crest, the cliff falls away very steeply. Down there are ledges, and caves. This is where they are digging. The villagers think they are the crazy men. What, treasure up there? Dust and rocks, and that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy nodded. \u0027But Janos knows better, eh? Let\u0027s face it, if he buried it, he should know where to dig for it!\u0027\\n\\n Manolis agreed. \u0027As for the tourists: there are maybe thirty of them right now. They spend their time in the tavernas, on the beach, lazing around. They are on holiday, right? Some climb up to the castle, but never down the other side. And never at night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It feels weird,\u0027 said Darcy, after a while.\\n\\n \u0027What does?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re going up there to kill these things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 Manolis answered. \u0027But only if it\u0027s necessary. I mean, only if they are things!\u0027\\n\\n Darcy gave an involuntary shudder and glanced at the long, narrow wicker basket which lay between them. Inside it were spearguns, wooden stakes, Harry Keogh\u0027s crossbow, and a gallon of petrol in a plastic container. \u0027Oh, they are,\u0027 he said then, and offered a curt nod. \u0027You can believe me, they are...\u0027\\n\\n Fifteen minutes later Nikos brought his vehicle to a halt in a rising re-entry. To the left, pathways which were little more than goat tracks led steeply up through the ruined streets of an ancient, long-deserted hill town; above the ruins stood a gleaming white monastery, apparently still in use; and higher still, on the almost sheer crown of the mountain itself -\\n\\n \u0027 - The castle!\u0027 Manolis breathed.\\n\\n As Nikos and his wonderful three-wheel workhorse made an awkward turn and went rattling and jolting back down into the valley, Darcy shielded his eyes to gaze up at the ominous walls of the castle, standing guard there as it had through all the long centuries. \u0027But ... is there a way up?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Manolis nodded. \u0027A goat track. Hairpins all the way, but quite safe. According to the fishermen, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n Carrying the basket between them, they set out to climb. Beyond the monastery and before the real climbing could begin, they paused to look back. Across the valley, they could pick out the boundaries of long-forsaken fields and the shells of old houses, where olive groves and orchards had long run wild and returned to nature.\\n\\n \u0027Sponges,\u0027 said Manolis, by way of explanation. \u0027They were sponge fishermen, these people. But when the sponges ran out, so did the people. Now, as you see, it\u0027s mainly ruins. Perhaps one day the tourists will bring it back to life again, eh?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy had other things than life on his mind. \u0027Let\u0027s get on,\u0027 he said. \u0027Already I don\u0027t want to go any further, and if we hang about much longer I won\u0027t want to go at all!\u0027\\n\\n After that it was all ochre boulders, yellow outcrops and winding goat tracks, and where there were gaps in the rocks dizzying views which were almost vertiginous. But eventually they found themselves in the shadow of enormous walls and passed under a massive, sloping stone lintel into the ruin itself. The place was polyglot and Darcy had been right about its historic value. It was Ancient Greek, Byzantine, and last but not least Crusader. Climbing up onto walls three to four feet thick, the view was fantastic, with all the coastlines of Halki and its neighbouring islands laid open to them.\\n\\n They clambered over heaps of stony debris in the shell of a Crusader chapel whose walls still carried fading murals of saints wearing faded haloes, and finally stood on the rim of the ruins looking down on the Bay of Trachia.\\n\\n \u0027Down there,\u0027 said Manolis. That\u0027s where they are. Look: do you see those signs of excavation, where all of that rubble makes a dark streak on the weathered rocks? That\u0027s them. Now we must find the track down to them. Darcy, are you all right? You have that look again.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy was anything but all right. They... they\u0027re down there,\u0027 he said. \u0027I feel rooted to the spot. Every step weighs like lead. Christ, my talent\u0027s a coward!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You want to rest here a moment?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027God, no! If I stop now I\u0027ll not get started again. Let\u0027s get on.\u0027\\n\\n There were several empty cigarette packets, scuff marks on the rocks, places where the sandy soil had been compacted by booted feet; the way down was neither hard to find nor difficult to negotiate. Soon they found a rusting wheelbarrow and a broken pick standing on the wide shelf of a natural ledge which had weathered out from the strata. And half-way along the ledge... that was where much of the stony debris had been excavated from the mouths of several gaping caves. Moving quietly, they approached the cave showing the most recent signs of work and paused at its entrance. And as they took out spearguns from their basket and loaded them, Manolis whispered: \u0027You\u0027re sure we\u0027ll need these, yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 Darcy nodded, his face ashen.\\n\\n Manolis took a step into the echoing mouth of the cave.\\n\\n \u0027Wait!\u0027 Darcy gasped, his Adam\u0027s apple working. \u0027It would be safer to call them out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And let them know we\u0027re here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In the sunlight, we\u0027ll have the advantage,\u0027 Darcy gulped. \u0027And anyway, my urge to get the fuck out of here just climbed the scale by several big notches. Which probably means they already know we\u0027re here!\u0027\\n\\n He was right. A shadow stepped forward out of the cave\u0027s darker shadows, moving carefully towards them where they stood in the entrance. They looked at each other with widening eyes, and together thumbed the safeties off their weapons and lifted them warningly. The man in the cave kept coming, but turned his shoulder side on and went into something of a forward leaning crouch.\\n\\n Manolis spat out a stream of gabbled Greek curses, snatched his Beretta from its shoulder holster and transferred the speargun to his left hand. The man, thing, vampire was still coming at them out of the dark, but they saw him more clearly now. He was tall, slim, strangely ragged-looking in silhouette. He wore a wide-brimmed hat, baggy trousers, a shirt whose unbuttoned sleeves flapped loosely at the wrists. He looked for all the world like a scarecrow let down off his pole. But it wasn\u0027t crows he was scaring.\\n\\n \u0027Only... one of them?\u0027 Darcy gasped - and felt his hair stand on end as he heard pebbles sliding and clattering on the ledge behind them!\\n\\n The man in the cave lunged forward; Manolis\u0027s gun flashed blindingly, deafeningly; Darcy looked back and saw a second - creature? - bearing down on them. But this one was much closer. Like his colleague in the cave he wore a floppy hat, and in its shade his eyes were yellow, viciously feral. Worse, he held a pickaxe slantingly overhead, and his face was twisted in a snarl where he aimed it at Darcy\u0027s back!\\n\\n Darcy - or perhaps his talent - turned himself to meet the attack, aimed point-blank, squeezed the trigger of his speargun. The harpoon flew straight to its target in the vampire\u0027s chest. The impact brought him to a halt; he dropped his pickaxe, clutched at the spear where it transfixed him, staggered back against the wall of the cliff. Darcy, frozen for a moment, could only watch him lurching and mewling there, coughing up blood.\\n\\n In the cave, Manolis cursed and fired his gun again -and yet again - as he followed his target deeper into the darkness. Then... Darcy heard an inhuman shriek followed by the slither of silver on steel, and finally the meaty thwack of Manolis\u0027s harpoon entering flesh. The sounds brought him out of his shock as he realized that both his and Manolis\u0027s weapons were now empty. He leaned to grab a harpoon from the open basket, and the man on the ledge staggered forward and kicked the whole thing, basket and contents, right off the rim!\\n\\n \u0027Jesus!\u0027 Darcy yelled, his throat hoarse and dry as sandpaper as again the flame-eyed thing turned towards him. Then the vampire paused, looked about and saw its pickaxe where it lay close to the rising cliff. It moved to pick it up, and Darcy moved too. His talent told him to run, run, run! But he yelled \u0027Fuck you!\u0027 and flew like a madman at the stooping vampire. He bowled the thing over, and himself snatched up the pick. The tool was heavy but such was Darcy\u0027s terror that it felt like a toy in his hands.\\n\\n Manolis came unsteadily out of the cave in time to see Darcy swing his weapon in a deadly arc and punch the wider point of its dual-purpose head into his undead opponent\u0027s forehead. The creature made gurgling, gagging sounds and sank to its knees, then slumped against the cliff face.\\n\\n \u0027Petrol,\u0027 Manolis gasped.\\n\\n \u0027Over the edge,\u0027 Darcy told him, his voice a croak.\\n\\n Manolis looked over the rim. Further down the mountain, maybe fifty feet lower, the wicker basket was jammed in the base of a rocky outcrop, where debris from the diggings had piled up to form a scree slide. The lid was open and several items lay scattered about. \u0027You stay, keep watch, and I\u0027ll get it,\u0027 Manolis said.\\n\\n He gave Darcy his gun and started to clamber down. Darcy kept one eye on the vampire with the pickaxe in his head, and the other on the leering mouth of the cave. The creature he had dealt with - a man, yes, but a creature, too - was not \u0027dead\u0027. It should be, but of course it was undead. The small percentage of its system which was vampire protoplasm was working in it even now, desperately healing its wounds. Even as Darcy watched it shuddered and its yellow eyes opened, and its hand crept shakily towards the harpoon in its chest.\\n\\n Gritting his teeth, Darcy stepped closer to it. His guardian angel howled at him, poured adrenalin into his veins and yelled run, run! But he shut out all warnings and grasped the end of the spear, and yanked it this way and that in the vampire\u0027s flesh, until the thing gnashed its teeth and coughed up blood, then flopped back and lay still again.\\n\\n Darcy stepped back from it on legs that trembled like jelly - and gave a mighty, heart-stopping start as something grasped his ankle!\\n\\n He glanced back and down, and saw the one from the cave where he\u0027d come crawling, his iron hand clasping Darcy\u0027s foot. There was a spear through his throat just under the Adam\u0027s apple, and the right side of the thing\u0027s face had been shot half away, but still he was mobile and one mad eye continued to glare from a black orbit set in a mess of red flesh. Darcy might easily have fainted then; instead he fell backwards away from the undead thing, and sat down with a bump on the ledge. And aiming directly between his feet, he emptied Manolis\u0027s gun right into the grimacing half-face.\\n\\n At that point Manolis returned. He hauled the basket up behind him, ripped open its lid and yanked out Harry Keogh\u0027s crossbow. A moment later he was loading up, and just in time ... for the one on the ledge had torn the pickaxe from its head and was now working to pull out the harpoon from its chest!\\n\\n \u0027Jesus! Oh, Jesus!\u0027 Manolis croaked. He stepped close to the blood-frothing horror, aimed his weapon from less than three feet away, and fired the wooden bolt straight into its heart.\\n\\n Darcy had meanwhile scrambled backwards away from the other creature. Manolis caught hold of him and hauled him to his feet, said: \u0027Let\u0027s finish it, while we still can.\u0027\\n\\n They dragged the vampires back inside the cave, as far back as they dared, then hurried back out into sunlight. But Darcy was finished; he could do no more; his talent was freezing hiiri right out of it. \u0027Is OK,\u0027 Manolis understood. \u0027I can do it.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy crawled away along the ledge and sat there shivering, while Manolis took up the petrol and again entered the cave. A moment later and he reappeared, leaving a thin trail of petrol behind him. He\u0027d liberally doused everything in the cave and the container was almost empty. He backed away towards Darcy, sprinkling the last few drops, then tossed the container far out into empty air and took out a cigarette lighter. Striking the flint, he held the naked flame to the trail of petrol.\\n\\n Blue fire so faint as to be almost invisible raced back along the ledge and into the mouth of the cave. There came a whoosh and a tongue of fire like some giant\u0027s blowtorch - followed in the next moment by a terrific explosion that blew out the mouth of the cave in chunks of shattered rock and brought loose scree and pebbles avalanching down from above. The shock of it was sufficient to cause Manolis to stumble, and sit down beside Darcy.\\n\\n They looked at each other and Darcy said: \u0027What the - ?\u0027\\n\\n Manolis\u0027s jaw hung loosely open. Then he licked dry lips and said: \"Their explosives. They must have kept their explosive charges in there.\u0027\\n\\n They got up and went shakily back to the blocked mouth of the cave. Down below, boulders were still bounding down the mountain\u0027s steep contours to the sea. Hundreds of tons of rock had come crushingly down, sealing the diggings off. And it was plain that nothing alive - but nothing - was ever going to come out of there.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s done,\u0027 said Manolis, and Darcy found strength to nod his agreement.\\n\\n As they turned away, Darcy saw something gleaming yellow in the rubble. Next door to the collapsed cave another, smaller opening was still issuing puffs of dust and a little smoke. The stone wall between the two excavations had been shattered, spilling fractured rock onto the ledge. But among the debris lay a lot more than just rocks.\\n\\n Darcy and Manolis stepped among the rubble and looked more closely at what had been unearthed. There in that broken wall, carefully packed in and sealed behind cleverly shaped blocks of stone, had lain the treasure for which Jianni Lazarides - alias Janos Ferenczy - had searched. That same treasure he himself had lain down all those centuries ago. Only the changing contours of the mountain, carved and fretted by nature in storms and earthquakes, had confused and foiled him. The old Crusader castle had been his landmark, but even that massive silhouette had crumbled and changed through the long years. Still, he\u0027d missed his mark by no more than two or three feet.\\n\\n The two men scuffed among the dust and broken rocks, their excitement dulled to anticlimax after the horror of their too recent experience. They saw a treasure out of time: Thracian gold! Small bowls and lidded cups... gold rhytons spilling rings, necklaces and arm clasps... a bronze helmet stuffed to brimming with earrings, belt clasps and pectorals... even a buckled breastplate of solid gold!\\n\\n Their find eventually got through to Manolis. \u0027But what do we do with it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We leave it here,\u0027 Darcy straightened up. \u0027It belongs to the ghosts. We don\u0027t know what it cost Janos to bring it here and bury it, or where - or how - he got it in the first place. But there\u0027s blood on it, be sure. Eventually someone will come looking for those two, and find this instead. Let the authorities handle it. I don\u0027t even want to touch it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You are right,\u0027 said Manolis, and they climbed back up to the castle.\\n\\n By 12:30 the two were back down into the village, where Manolis refuelled the boat for the trip to Karpathos. While he worked his fishermen friends came over and asked how were the diggers. \u0027They were blasting,\u0027 Manolis answered after a moment, \u0027so we didn\u0027t disturb them. Anyway, the cliffs are very steep and a man could easily fall.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Snotty buggers anyway,\u0027 one of the fishermen commented. \u0027They don\u0027t bother with us and we don\u0027t bother with them!\u0027\\n\\n Finished with his fuelling, Manolis bought a litre of ouzo and they all sat around tables in an open taverna and killed the bottle dead. Later, as their boat pulled away from the stone jetty, the Greek said, \u0027I needed that.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy sighed and agreed, \u0027Me, too. It\u0027s nasty, thirsty work.\u0027\\n\\n Manolis looked at him and nodded. \u0027And a lot more of it to come before we\u0027re through, my friend. It is perhaps the good job ouzo is cheap, eh? Just think, with all of that gold we left up there, we could have bought the distillery!\u0027 Darcy looked back and watched the hump of rock which was Halki slowly sinking on the horizon, and thought: Yes, and maybe we\u0027ll wish we had...\\n\\n Halki to Karpathos was a little more than sixty miles by the route Manolis chose; he preferred to stay in sight of land so far as possible, and to cruise rather than race his engine. When the rocks Ktenia and Karavolas were behind them, then he set a course more nearly south-west and left Rhodes behind for Karpathos proper.\\n\\n That meant the open sea, and now Darcy\u0027s stomach began to play him up a little. It was a purely physical thing and not too bad; after what he\u0027d faced already he wasn\u0027t going to throw up now. At least his talent wasn\u0027t warning against shipwrecks or anything.\\n\\n To take Darcy\u0027s mind off his misery, Manolis told him a few details about Karpathos:\\n\\n \u0027Second biggest of the Dodecanese Islands,\u0027 he said. \u0027She lies just about half-way between Rhodes and Crete. Where Halki goes east to west, Karpathos she goes north to south. Maybe fifty kilometres long but only seven or eight wide. Just the crest of submarine mountains, that\u0027s all. Not the big place, really, and not many peoples. But she has known the turbulent history!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is that right?\u0027 said Darcy, scarcely listening.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes! Just about everyone ruled or owned or was the governor of Karpathos at one time or another. The Arabs, Italian pirates out of Genoa, the Venetians, Crusaders of the Knights of St John, Turks, Russians - even the British! Huh! It took seven centuries for us Greeks to get it back!\u0027\\n\\n And when there was no answer: \u0027Darcy? Are you all right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Only just. How long before we\u0027re there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re almost half-way there already, my friend. Another hour, or not much more, and we\u0027ll be rounding the point just under the landing strip. That\u0027s where we should find the Lazarus. We can take a look at her, but that\u0027s all. Maybe we can hail someone - or something -on board, and see what we think of him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right now I don\u0027t think much of anybody,\u0027 said Darcy...\\n\\n But as it happened Manolis was wrong and the Lazarus was not there. They searched the small bays at the southern extremity of the island, but found no sign of the white ship. Manolis\u0027s patience was soon exhausted. In a little while, when it became obvious that their searching was in vain, he headed north for the sandy shallow-water beach at Amoupi and anchored there where they could wade ashore. They ate a Greek salad at the beach taverna, and drank a small bottle of retsina between them. When Darcy fell asleep in his chair under the taverna\u0027s split-bamboo awning, then Manolis sighed, sat back and lit a cigarette. He smoked several, admired the tanned, bouncing breasts of English girls where they played in the sea, drank another bottle of retsina before it was time to wake Darcy up. Just after 5:05 they set out to return to Rhodes.\\n\\n That evening, coming in stiff, weary, and tanned by sun and sea-spray, Darcy and Manolis found four people waiting for them in the lounge of their hotel. There were several moments of confusion. Darcy knew two of the arrivals well enough, for Ben Trask and David Chung were his own men; but Zekintha Foener (now Simmons), and her husband Michael or \u0027Jazz\u0027, were strangers to him except by hearsay. Darcy had anticipated four and had booked accommodation accordingly, but of this specific group he had only expected two. On Harry Keogh\u0027s advice he had tried to get a message to Zek and Jazz that they should stay out of it, but either it hadn\u0027t reached them or they had chosen to ignore it. He would find out later. The two missing men were E-Branch operatives finalizing a job in England, who would fly out here a.s.a.p. on completion of that task.\\n\\n The four newcomers, having already dropped off their luggage in their rooms and introduced each other, were more or less ready to talk business. Darcy need only introduce Manolis and make known the Greek policeman\u0027s role in things, then replay the action so far, and all systems would be go. Before that, however...\\n\\n ... Darcy and Manolis excused themselves and took invigorating showers before rejoining the E-Branch people where they waited for them. Then Manolis took them all to a rather expensive taverna on the other side of town which wasn\u0027t likely to be swamped with tourists, and there arranged seating around a large secluded corner table with a view on the night ocean. Here Darcy quickly restated the introductions, this time detailing the various talents of his group.\\n\\n There was the married couple Zek and Jazz Simmons, who had been on Starside together with Harry Keogh. Zek was a telepath of outstanding ability and an authority on vampires. She was experienced as few before her, in that she had met up with the minds of the Real Thing, the Wamphyri themselves, in an entirely alien world. She was very good-looking, about five-nine in height, slim, blonde and blue-eyed. Her Greek mother had named her after Zante (or Zakinthos), the island where she was born. Her father had been East German, a parapsychologist. Zek would be in her mid-thirties, maybe eighteen months to two years older than her husband.\\n\\n Jazz Simmons had no extraordinary talents other than those with which an entirely mundane Mother Nature had endowed him, plus those in which British Intelligence had expertly instructed him. After Starside, he had opted out of intelligence work to be with Zek in Greece and the Greek islands. Just a fraction under six feet tall, Jazz had unruly red hair, a square jaw under slightly hollow cheeks, grey eyes, good strong teeth, hands that were hard for all that they were artistically tapered, and long arms that gave him something of a gangling, loose-limbed appearance. Lean, tanned and athletic, he looked deceptively easy-going... was easy-going in normal circumstances and when there was little or no pressure. But he was not to be underestimated. He\u0027d been trained to a cutting edge in surveillance, close protection, escape and evasion, winter warfare, survival, weapons handling (to marksman grade), demolition and unarmed combat. The only thing Jazz had lacked had been experience, and he\u0027d got that in the best - or worst - of all possible places, on Starside.\\n\\n Then there were the two men from E-Branch: David Chung, a locator and scryer, and Ben Trask, a human lie-detector. Chung was twenty-six, a Chinese \u0027Cockney\u0027 tried and true. Born within the sound of Bow bells, he had been with the Branch for nearly six years and during that time had trained himself to a high degree in the extrasensory location of illegal drugs, especially cocaine. If not for the fact that he\u0027d been working on a long-term case in London, then he and not Ken Layard might well have been out here in the first place.\\n\\n Ben Trask was a blocky five feet ten, mousey-haired and green-eyed, overweight and slope-shouldered, and usually wore what could only be described as a lugubrious expression. His speciality was Truth: presented with a lie or deliberately falsified concept, Trask would spot it immediately. E-Branch loaned him out to the police authorities on priority jobs, and he was in great demand by Foreign Affairs to see through the political posturing of certain less than honest members of the international community. Ben Trask knew the ins and outs of London\u0027s foreign embassies better than most people know the backs of their hands. Also, he\u0027d played a part in the Yulian Bodescu affair and wasn\u0027t likely to take anything too lightly.\\n\\n While they waited for their meals, Darcy filled in all the missing pieces for his team and watched them tighten up as the full horror of the situation was brought home to them. Then he was interested to know why Jazz and Zek had invited themselves in on this thing.\\n\\n Jazz answered for them. \u0027It\u0027s Harry, isn\u0027t it? Harry Keogh? He gets our vote every time. If Harry has problems, it\u0027s no use telling Zek and me to keep a low profile.\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s very loyal of you,\u0027 Darcy told him, \u0027but it was Harry himself who would have preferred to keep you out of it - for your own sakes. Not that I\u0027m complaining... I\u0027m short of a couple of good hands and you two probably fit the bill perfectly. Harry\u0027s main concern was that Janos Ferenczy is one powerful mentalist. He has already killed Trevor Jordan and controls Ken Layard, so you can see why Harry was worried. He was mainly concerned about what would happen if Janos came up against you, Zek. However, since Janos is now in Romania - that is, to the best of our knowledge - and with Harry gone there to hunt him down...\u0027 Darcy shrugged. \u0027Myself, I\u0027m delighted to have you on the team!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So when does it all start - for us, I mean?\u0027 David Chung was eager to get into it.\\n\\n \u0027For you it starts tomorrow,\u0027 Darcy told him. \u0027The \"active service\" part of it, anyway. Tonight, back at the hotel after we\u0027ve finished here, that will be the time for preparation and planning. That\u0027s when we detail, as best we can, who will be doing what - and to whom!\u0027 He spied a waiter moving towards their table with a loaded trolley. \u0027As for this very moment: I suggest we enjoy our food and relax as best we can. Because you\u0027d better believe that tomorrow\u0027s a busy day.\u0027\\n\\n While Darcy Clarke and his team thought forward to their next day, Harry Keogh was looking back on the one just ended.\\n\\n Harry\u0027s flight to Athens had been uneventful. Aboard the plane for Budapest, however, when he\u0027d closed his eyes even before takeoff and determined to catch an hour\u0027s sleep...\\n\\n ... He\u0027d felt them there the moment he began to drift into dreams: alien probes touching on his mind. And knowing they were there he\u0027d forced himself to stay awake and alert, while yet hiding that fact from the telepathic talents who had found him. \u0027They\u0027 could only be Ken Layard and Sandra, but their ESP was cold now and tainted. Almost completely in thrall to Janos Ferenczy, their tentative touches were slimy as the walls of a sewer, so that Harry must fight not to recoil from them. But he remembered what Faethor had told him, and strangely enough accepted that it was probably good advice:\\n\\n Instead of shrinking back from him when you sense him near, seek him out! He would enter your mind? Enter his!\\n\\n And as the vampire intelligences grew less apprehensive of discovery and avidly scanned him, so Harry in turn scanned them. Indeed he spoke to them in whispers, under his breath:\\n\\n \u0027Ken? Sandra? So he has your co-operation now. Well, and you\u0027ve done a good job for him. But why so secretive about it, eh? I was expecting you. I knew that he would use you, that in fact he can\u0027t do without you. What, him? Face to face and man to man? Not a chance. Your vampire superman is a coward! He fears I\u0027ll creep up on him in the night. One man against him and everything he harbours up there in that pesthole in the mountains, and he\u0027s afraid of me. You warned me he\u0027d read the future and seen his victory there. Well, you can tell him from me that the future doesn\u0027t always work out that way.\u0027\\n\\n Ahhh! He sensesss ussss! It was Sandra, hissing like a snake in Harry\u0027s mind. He knows us. His thoughts are strong. His hidden strengths are surfacing.\\n\\n She was right and Harry felt the strangeness of it. He was stronger, and didn\u0027t know the source of his new vitality. Was it Faethor? he wondered. Possibly. But for the moment there was nothing he could do about Faethor, and in a storm any port is better than none.\\n\\n Ken Layard\u0027s locator\u0027s mind was fastened on Harry like a carrier beam. He let his own slide down it (but secretly) to its source, gazed out through Layard\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n It was as if Harry were there in the flesh... and he was, in Layard\u0027s flesh! They were in the same subterranean room as before. Sandra sat opposite him (opposite Layard) at the table, and Janos furiously paced the pavings to and fro, to and fro. \u0027Where is he? What is he thinking?\u0027 the monster\u0027s eyes burned red where he turned them on Sandra. Plainly he was worried, but he tried to hide it behind a mask of fury.\\n\\n \u0027He is aboard a plane,\u0027 Sandra answered, \u0027and he is coming.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So soon? He\u0027s a madman! Doesn\u0027t he know he\u0027ll die? Can he not see that my plans for him go beyond death? What are his thoughts?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He hides them from me.\u0027\\n\\n Janos stopped pacing, thrust his half-handsome, half-hideous face at her. \u0027He hides his thoughts? And you a mentalist, a thought-thief? What, and do you seek to make a fool of me? And have I not warned you how it will go for you, if you continue to place obstacles in my way? Now I ask you again: what - are - his �C thoughts!\u0027\\n\\n The master vampire had come forward to lean upon the table with both hands, glaring into the frightened girl\u0027s eyes from only inches away. His lips curled back like a leather muzzle shrivelling from the jagged teeth of some dead carnivore, threatening her all too graphically, but she had no answer for him except: \u0027He - he is too strong for me!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Too strong for you?\u0027 Janos raged. \u0027Too strong? Listen: in the bowels of this very castle lie the ashes of men like satyrs who in their day swarmed rampant across this land raping to the death women, men and babes alike!\u0027 he told her. \u0027Aye, and when they\u0027d slain the lot, then even the beasts of the field were not beneath their lust! For two thousand years some of these creatures - whose loins are now dust, whose bones are turned to salts - have gone without. But I say this to you: do my bidding now before I\u0027m tempted to raise them up and command them how to instruct you! An unending torment, Sandra, aye: for I would line them up against you, and as fast as they tore you your vampire would repair the damage! Only picture it: your sweet flesh awash in all their filth, ruined and ruined again... and again... and again!\u0027\\n\\n Harry looked at him out of Layard\u0027s eyes, drew phlegm up from Layard\u0027s throat, and spat it into the vampire\u0027s face. And as the monster went reeling, gurgling and clawing at his face, Harry said to him with Layard\u0027s voice: \u0027Are you deaf as well as insane, Janos Ferenczy? She can\u0027t see into my affairs - for I am right here, seeing into yours!\u0027\\n\\n Layard, shocked and astonished, sat clutching at his own throat; but for a few seconds more at least, Harry kept a grip on what he now commanded.\\n\\n Janos staggered back to the table, his head cocked questioningly, disbelievingly on one side. \u0027What?\u0027 he glared madly at Layard. \u0027What?\u0027 He lifted a claw of a hand.\\n\\n \u0027Go on,\u0027 Harry taunted. \u0027Strike! For it\u0027s only your thrall you\u0027ll hurt and not the one who commands him!\u0027\\n\\n Janos\u0027s jaw fell open. He understood. \u0027You?\u0027 he breathed.\\n\\n Harry caused Layard\u0027s face to split into a humourless grin. And: \u0027You know,\u0027 he said, \u0027this fascination of yours with my mind isn\u0027t merely unhealthy and irksome, I suspect it\u0027s also contagious. I had thought you would learn your lesson, Janos, but apparently I was wrong. Very well ... so now let\u0027s see what goes on in your head!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Release him!\u0027 Janos howled, clutching his head in talon hands and hurling himself away from the table. \u0027Send the Necroscope out of here! I don\u0027t want him in my mind!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 Harry told him, as Layard jerked and writhed where he sat. \u0027Did you really think I would bathe myself in a sewer? Only remember this, Janos Ferenczy: you sought to discover my plans. Well, and now I\u0027ll tell them to you. I\u0027m coming for you, Janos. And as you now see, our powers are more or less equal.\u0027\\n\\n He withdrew from Layard\u0027s mind and opened his eyes. The plane was off the ground, heading north and a little west for Budapest. And Harry was well satisfied. Back in Edinburgh less than a week ago he\u0027d wondered at his precognitive glimpses of some vague and frightening future, and felt that he stood on the threshold of strange new developments. Now he experienced a sense of justification: his Necroscope\u0027s powers were growing, expanding to fill the gap created by Harry Jnr\u0027s tampering. That was Harry\u0027s explanation, anyway...\\n\\n Half-way into the flight - asleep in his seat, and unafraid to be asleep - Harry reached out with his deadspeak and found M\u0026ouml;bius resting in the Leipzig graveyard where he lay buried. M\u0026ouml;bius knew him at once and said: Harry, I called out to you but got no answer. Actually, I\u0027ve been half-afraid to contact you. That last time ... it was frightening, Harry.\\n\\n Harry nodded. So now you know what I\u0027m up against. Well, at the moment I have him on the run; he\u0027s not sure what I can do; but he knows whatever he plans against me will have to be more physical than mental. Physically, I\u0027m still very vulnerable. That\u0027s why I need the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum.\\n\\n M\u0026ouml;bius was at once willing. You want me to take it up where I left off?\\n\\n Yes.\\n\\n Very well, open your mind to me.\\n\\n Harry did as he was instructed, said: Enter of your own free will, and a moment later felt M\u0026ouml;bius timid in the labyrinth vaults of his mind.\\n\\n You\u0027re an open book, said M\u0026ouml;bius. I could read you, if I wished it.\\n\\n Find the pages that are stuck down, Harry told him. Unglue them for me. That\u0027s the part of me that I\u0027ve lost. Only unlock those doors and I\u0027ll have access to my best shot.\\n\\n M\u0026ouml;bius went deeper, into yawning caverns of extra-mundane mind. And: Locked? he said then. I\u0027ll say they have been - and by an expert! But Harry, these are no ordinary locks and bolts and bars. I\u0027m within the threshold of your Knowledge, where an entire section has been closed off. This is indeed the source of your instinctive maths, but it is sealed with symbols I don\u0027t even recognize! Whoever did it... was a genius!\\n\\n Harry offered a grim nod. Yes, he was. But Faethor Ferenczy, and his son Janos, they were both able to open those doors by sheer force of will.\\n\\n M\u0026ouml;bius was realistic. They are Wamphyri, Harry. And I was only a man. I was a determined man, and I was patient. But I was not a giant!\\n\\n You can\u0027t do it? Harry held his breath.\\n\\n Not by force of will. By reason, perhaps.\\n\\n Then do what you can, Harry breathed again.\\n\\n I may need your help.\\n\\n How can I help you?\\n\\n While I work, you can study.\\n\\n Study what?\\n\\n Your numbers, said M\u0026ouml;bius, surprised. What else?\\n\\n But I know less than a backward child! Harry protested. Why, to me the very word \u0027numbers\u0027 suggests only a vague and troublesome concept.\\n\\n Study them anyway, M\u0026ouml;bius told him, and lit up a screen before his inner eye. Simple additions awaited solutions, and incomplete multiplication tables glared at Harry with empty white spaces for eyes, waiting for him to print the answers on their pupils.\\n\\n I... I don\u0027t know the fucking answers! Harry groaned.\\n\\n Then work them out, M\u0026ouml;bius growled. For he had problems enough of his own.\\n\\n Four rows of seats in front of Harry, across the central aisle, someone turned to glance back at his pale, troubled, sleeping face. The man was girl-slender and effeminate in his mannerisms. He smoked a Marlboro in a cigarette holder, and his heavy-lidded, deep set-eyes were dark as his thoughts.\\n\\n Nikolai Zharov had fouled up very badly in England and this was his punishment. Where Norman Harold Wellesley and Romania\u0027s Securitatea had failed, now it was Zharov\u0027s turn. His superiors had spelled it out to him: go to Greece and kill Keogh yourself. And if you fail... don\u0027t bother to come back.\\n\\n Well, Greece was way back there somewhere now, but Zharov didn\u0027t suppose it mattered much. Greece, Hungary, Romania - who would care where he died? No one at all -\\n\\n - Just as long as he died...\\n\\n By 6:30 p.m. Harry Keogh, tourist, had been out of Budapest airport and onto a train heading east for a place called Mezobereny. That had been the end of the line for him, the halt at which he\u0027d disembarked. Past Mezobereny the tracks turned southward for Arad, which was too far out of his way. From now on Harry would go by bus, taxi, cart, on foot - whatever it took.\\n\\n On the outskirts of Mezobereny he found a small family hotel called the Sarkad after the district, where he took a room for the night. He\u0027d chosen the Sarkad for the old world graveyard which stood guarded by tall, shady trees in a few acres just across the dusty village road. If there were to be night visitations - dreams influenced by his enemies, maybe, or perhaps more physical visitors -Harry wanted the dead on his side. Which was why, before he settled down for the night, he stood by his window and sent his deadspeak thoughts out across the road to the dead in their graves.\\n\\n They had heard of the Necroscope, of course, but could scarcely believe that he was actually here; full of questions, they kept him busy until late. But as the midnight hour slipped by, Harry was obliged to tell them that he was tired, and that he really must rest in preparation for the day ahead. And, getting into bed, he thought to himself: What a masterpiece of understatement!\\n\\n Harry was no spy in the normal sense of the word. If he had been then he might have noticed the man who\u0027d followed him from the railway station to the Sarkad and taken the room next door.\\n\\n Earlier, Nikolai Zharov had listened to the Necroscope moving about in his room, and when Harry had gone to his window, so had the Russian. The light from the rooms had fallen on the road, casting Harry\u0027s shadow where he stood looking out. Zharov had moved back, put out his light, then approached the window again. And he\u0027d looked where Harry was looking.\\n\\n Then, for the first time, Zharov had noticed the graveyard. And at that he\u0027d shuddered, drawn his curtains, lit a cigarette and sat on the edge of his bed to smoke it. Zharov knew about Harry Keogh\u0027s talent. He had been in Bonnyrig when Wellesley tried to kill the Necroscope, and he\u0027d seen what came out of Keogh\u0027s garden after the traitor\u0027s attack failed. Add to that certain details from the report of those Securitatea cretins in Romania, and... perhaps this wasn\u0027t after all the perfect time or place for a murder.\\n\\n But it seemed a perfectly good time to check his weapons. He opened the secret compartment in the base of his briefcase, took out and assembled the parts of a small but deadly automatic pistol. A magazine of sixteen rounds went up into the grip, and a spare magazine into his pocket. There was also a knife with an eight-inch blade slender as a screwdriver, and a garotte consisting of a pair of grips with eighteen inches of piano wire strung between them. Any one of these methods would suffice, but Zharov must be sure when the time came that it was performed with despatch. Keogh must not be given the least opportunity to talk to anyone. Or rather, to anything.\\n\\n And again the picture of those two - people? - spied across the river near Bonnyrig, coming out of Keogh\u0027s garden, flashed unbidden on Zharov\u0027s mind\u0027s eye. He remembered how they\u0027d moved - each step an effort of supernatural will - and how one of them had seemed to be leaving bits behind, which followed on of their own accord after him into the night.\\n\\n It was early when the Russian thought these things; he wasn\u0027t yet ready for bed; putting on his coat again, he\u0027d gone down to the hotel barroom to get himself a drink.\\n\\n Indeed, several drinks...\\n\\n Just as Harry had talked to his new friends in their place across the road when he was awake, so he now talked to them in his dreams; except this time the conversation was far less coherent, indeed vague, as most dreams are. But he was not so deeply asleep that he couldn\u0027t sense Ken Layard\u0027s locator mind when it swept over him (which it did, frequently), nor so far removed from the waking situation that he couldn\u0027t distinguish between the trivial gossip of the teeming dead and the occasional tidbit of real-life importance. So that when his deadspeak thoughts first picked up the new voice, he knew instinctively that this was a matter of some consequence.\\n\\n Accordingly, he made inquiry:\\n\\n Who are you? Were you looking for me?\\n\\n Harry Keogh? the new voice came up stronger. Thank God I\u0027ve found you!\\n\\n Do I know you? Harry was a little cautious.\\n\\n In a way, said the other. We\u0027ve met. Indeed, I tried to kill you!\\n\\n Now Harry recognized him, and knew why he hadn\u0027t made the connection earlier. It was simple: this was a voice he would normally associate with life - until now, anyway. It wasn\u0027t, or at least it shouldn\u0027t be, the voice of a dead man. Wellesley? he said. But... what happened?\\n\\n You mean, why am I dead? Well, they put me through quite a lot, Harry. Not physical stuff, no, of course not, but lots of questioning - you know? Physical I could probably handle, but mental? The deeper they dug into me the more clearly I could see what a shit I\u0027d been. It was all over for me. A long term to serve, no career to go back to, no real prospects. Well, it sounds hackneyed, I know, but the simple fact of it was that I was \u0027a ruined man\u0027. So... I hanged myself. See, they don\u0027t offer you a gun anymore - the honourable solution, and all that rot - so I used a pair of leather bootlaces. I was half-afraid they\u0027d snap, but they didn\u0027t.\\n\\n Harry found it hard to pity him. The man was a traitor after all. So what do you want from me? he said. Would you like me to say how sorry I am? Offer you a shoulder to cry on? Hey, I have lots of friends among the dead who didn\u0027t try to kill me!\\n\\n That\u0027s not why I\u0027m here, Harry, Wellesley told him. No, for I got what I deserved. I think we all do. I came to say I\u0027m sorry, that\u0027s all. To apologize that I wasn\u0027t stronger.\\n\\n Harry gave a snort. Oh, wow! he said. Gee, Harry, I\u0027m sorry I wasn\u0027t stronger. Hey, if I had been I would\u0027ve fucking killed you!\\n\\n Wellesley sighed. Well, it was worth a try. I\u0027m sorry I bothered you. It\u0027s just that when I killed myself, I didn\u0027t know my hard times were only just beginning. He began to withdraw.\\n\\n What\u0027s that? Harry held him. Your hard times? Then he saw what the other meant. The dead don\u0027t want to know you, right?\\n\\n Wellesley shrugged. He was a beaten man. Something like that. But it\u0027s like I said: we get what we deserve. I\u0027m sorry I bothered you, Harry.\\n\\n No, wait... Harry had an idea. Listen, what would you say to a chance to square it with me? And with the dead in general?\\n\\n Is there a way? (Sudden hope in Wellesley\u0027s voice.)\\n\\n There could be. It all depends.\\n\\n Just name it.\\n\\n You had this negative sort of talent, right?\\n\\n That\u0027s right. Nobody could see into my mind. But... as you can see, it died with me.\\n\\n Harry shook his head. Maybe it didn\u0027t. You see, what we\u0027re doing now isn\u0027t the same. It isn\u0027t telepathy but deadspeak. You control it yourself. You don\u0027t have to speak to me if you don\u0027t want to. That other thing you had was uncontrollable. You didn\u0027t even know it was there. If someone hadn\u0027t noticed it - hadn\u0027t discovered that your mind was a stone wall - you still wouldn\u0027t know you\u0027d ever had it. Am I right?\\n\\n I suppose you are. But what are you getting at?\\n\\n I\u0027m not sure, said Harry. I\u0027m not even sure if it\u0027s possible. But it would be one hell of a bonus if I had that talent of yours!\\n\\n Well, obviously it would, Wellesley answered. But as you\u0027ve just pointed out, it wasn\u0027t a talent. It was some kind of negative charge. It was there all the time, working on its own, without my knowledge or assistance.\\n\\n Maybe so, but somewhere in your mind there\u0027s the mechanism that governed it. I\u0027d just like to see how it works, that\u0027s all. Then, if I could sort of imitate it, learn how to switch it on and off at will...\\n\\n You want to have a look inside my mind? Are you saying there\u0027s a way you can do that?\\n\\n Maybe there is, said Harry, with your help. And maybe that\u0027s why no one else ever could: because you just kept them out... Now tell me, did you ever read my file?\\n\\n Of course, Wellesley gave a wry chuckle. At the time I thought it was fantastic. I remember one of the espers seeing your file lying on my desk, and telling me: \u0027I wouldn\u0027t be caught dead speaking to that guy!\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s not at all bad! Harry laughed. But he was serious again in a moment. And did you read about Dragosani, and how he stole Max Batu\u0027s evil eye?\\n\\n That, too, Wellesley answered. But he cut it out of his heart, read it in his guts, tasted it in his blood.\\n\\n Yes, he did, Harry nodded, but it doesn\u0027t have to be that way. You see, that\u0027s always been the difference between me and Dragosani\u0027s sort. It\u0027s the difference between a necromancer and a Necroscope. He would take what he wanted by force. He would torture for it. But me, I only ask.\\n\\n Anything I have, I give it willingly, Wellesley told him.\\n\\n Again Harry nodded. Well, that will go a long way with the dead, he said.\\n\\n So how will you do it? Wellesley was eager now.\\n\\n Actually, said Harry, it\u0027s you who has to do it.\\n\\n Really? So tell me how.\\n\\n Just let your mind go blank and invite me in, Harry answered. Just relax like I was a hypnotist putting you to sleep, and say to me: enter of your own free will.\\n\\n As easily as that?\\n\\n The first part, anyway, said Harry.\\n\\n Very well, Wellesley was committed. So let\u0027s try it... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iv-deadspeak-necroscope-4/page-14.html","bookId":2437,"book":{"id":2437,"title":"Necroscope IV: Deadspeak (Necroscope #4)","description":"Storyline: Several years after his return to earth Harry Sr. is trouble by nightmares of resurgent Vampires.
