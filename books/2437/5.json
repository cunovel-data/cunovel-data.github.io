{"id":78830,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"5\\n\\n Harry Keogh Now: Ex-Necroscope\\n\\n Harry woke up knowing that something was happening or about to happen. He was propped up in the huge old bed where he\u0027d nodded off, his head against the headboard, a fat, black-bound book open in his slack hands. The Book of the Vampire: a so-called \u0027factual treatise\u0027 which examined the elemental evil of the vampire down through all the ages to modern times. It was light reading for the Necroscope, and many of its \u0027well-authenticated cases\u0027 little more than grotesque jokes; for no one in the world - with one possible exception - knew more about the legend, the source, the truth of vampirism than Harry Keogh. That one exception was his son, also called Harry, except that Harry Jnr didn\u0027t count because in fact he wasn\u0027t \u0027in\u0027 this world at all but... somewhere else.\\n\\n Harry had been dreaming an old, troubled dream: one which mingled his life and loves of fifteen years gone by with those of the here and now, turning them into a surreal kaleidoscope of eroticism. He had dreamed of loving Helen, his first groping (mental as well as physical) sexual experience; and of Brenda, his first true love and the wife of his youth; so that however strange and overlapping, these had been sweet and familiar dreams, and tender. But he had also dreamed of the Lady Karen and her monstrous aerie in the world of the Wamphyri, and it seemed likely that this was the dreadful dream which had started him awake.\\n\\n But somewhere in there had been dreams of Sandra, too, his new and - he hoped - lasting love affair, which because of its freshness was more vivid, real and immediate than the others. It had taken the sting of poignancy from some of the dream, and the cold clutch of horror from the rest of it.\\n\\n That was what he had been dreaming about: making love to the women he had known, and to one he knew now. And also of making love to the Lady Karen, whom mercifully he had never known - not in that way.\\n\\n But Sandra... they\u0027d made love before on several occasions - no, on many occasions, though rarely satisfactorily - always at her place in Edinburgh, in the turned-down green glow of her bedside lamp. Not satisfactory for Harry, anyway; of course he couldn\u0027t speak for Sandra. He suspected, though, that she loved him dearly.\\n\\n He had never let her know about his - dissatisfaction? Not merely because he didn\u0027t want to hurt her, more especially because it would only serve to highlight his own deficiency. A deficiency, yes, and yet at the same time something of a paradox. Because by comparison with other men (Harry was not so naive as to believe there had been no others) he supposed that to Sandra he must seem almost superhuman.\\n\\n He could make love to her for an hour, sometimes longer, before bringing himself to climax. But he was not superhuman, at least not in that sense. It was simply that in bed he couldn\u0027t seem to get switched on to her. When he came, always it was with some other woman in his mind\u0027s eye. Any other woman: the friend of a friend or some brief, chance encounter; some cover girl or other; even the small girl Helen from his childhood, or the wife Brenda from his early manhood. A hell of a thing to admit about the woman you think you love, and who you\u0027re fairly sure loves you!\\n\\n His deficiency, obviously, for Sandra was very beautiful. Indeed, Harry should consider himself a lucky man - everybody said so. Maybe it was the cool, green, subdued lighting of her bedroom that turned him off: he didn\u0027t really care for green. And her eyes were greenish, too. Or a greeny-blue, anyway.\\n\\n That\u0027s why her part of this dream had been so different: in it they had made love and it had been good. He had been close to climax when he woke up ... when he\u0027d come awake knowing that something was about to happen.\\n\\n He woke up in his own bed, in his own country house near Bonnyrig, not far out of Edinburgh, with the book still in his hands. And feeling its weight there ... so maybe that\u0027s what had coloured his dreams. Vampires. The Wamphyri. Not surprising, really: they\u0027d coloured most of his dreams for several years now.\\n\\n Outside, dawn was on the brink; faint streamers of light, grey-green, filtered through the narrow slits of his blinds; they tinted the atmosphere of his bedroom with a faint watercolour haze, a wash of subdued submarine tints.\\n\\n Half-reclining there, becoming aware, coming back to life, he felt a tingle start up in his scalp. His hair was standing up on end. So was his penis, still throbbing from the dream. He was naked, electrically erect - and now aware and intent.\\n\\n He listened intently: to murmuring plumbing sounds as the central heating responded to its timer, to the first idiot twitterings of sleepy birds in the garden, to a world stretching itself in the strengthening dawn outside.\\n\\n Rarely sleeping more than an hour or two at a stretch, dawn was Harry\u0027s favourite time - normally. It was always good to know that the night was safely past, a new day underway. But this time he felt that something was happening, and he gazed intently through the faint green haze, turning his eyes to stare at the open bedroom door.\\n\\n Drugged by sleep, his eyes saw everything with soft edges, fuzzy and indistinct. There was nothing sharp in the entire room. Except his inexplicable intentness, which seemed odd when matched against his blurred vision.\\n\\n Anyone who ever started awake after a good drunk would know how he felt. You half-know where you are, you half-want to be somewhere special, you are half-afraid of not being where you should be; and even when you know where you are, you\u0027re still not quite sure you\u0027re there, or even that you are you. Part of the \u0027never again\u0027 syndrome.\\n\\n Except that Harry had not been drinking - not that he could remember, anyway.\\n\\n The other thing that invariably affected him on those occasions when he woke up like this - the thing which had used to frighten him a great deal, but which he\u0027d thought he was used to - was his paralysis. The fact that he could not move. It was only the transition from sleep to waking, he knew that, but still it was horrible. He had to force gradual movement into his limbs, usually starting with a hand or a foot. He was paralysed now, with only his eyes to command of all his various parts. He made them stare through the open bedroom door into the shadows beyond.\\n\\n Something was happening. Something had awakened him. Something had robbed him of the satisfaction of spilling himself into Sandra and enjoying it for once. Something was in the house...\\n\\n That would account for his tingling scalp, his hair standing erect at the back of his neck, his wilting hard-on. A perfume was in the air. Something moved in the shadows beyond the bedroom door: a movement sensed, not heard. Something came closer to the door, paused just out of sight in darkness.\\n\\n Harry wanted to call out: \u0027Who\u0027s there?\u0027 but his paralysis wouldn\u0027t let him. Perhaps he gurgled a little. A shape emerged partly from the shadows. Through the submarine haze he saw a navel, the lower part of a belly with its dark bush of pubic hair, the curve of soft feminine hips and the tops of thighs where they might show above dark stockings. She stood (whoever she was) just beyond the door, her flesh soft in the filtered light. As he watched she transferred her weight from one unseen foot to the other, her thighs moving, her hip jutting. Above the belly, soft in the shadows, there would be breasts large and ripe. Sandra had large breasts.\\n\\n It was Sandra, of course.\\n\\n Harry\u0027s voice still refused to work, but he could now move the fingers of his left hand. Sandra must be able to see him, see how she was affecting him. His dream was about to become reality. The blood coursed in his veins and began to pound once more. In the back of his mind, faintly, he asked himself questions. And answered them:\\n\\n Why had she come?\\n\\n Obviously for sex.\\n\\n How had she got in?\\n\\n He must have given her a key. He didn\u0027t remember doing so.\\n\\n Why didn\u0027t she come forward more clearly into view?\\n\\n Because she wanted to see him fully aroused first. Perhaps she had not wished to wake him until she was in bed with him.\\n\\n Why had she waited so long to show him that she could be sexually aggressive? She\u0027d taken the initiative before, certainly, but never to this extent.\\n\\n Maybe because she sensed his uncertainty - feared that he might be having second thoughts - or perhaps because she suspected he had never fully enjoyed her.\\n\\n Well, and maybe she was right.\\n\\n Staring was causing his right eye to jump, both eyes to water. It was the poor light. Harry willed his left hand to move, stretched it out, pulled the cord that closed the window shutters - to shut out a little more of the faint, greeny-grey light. That left the room in near-darkness -thin dim green stripes on a black velvet background. And that was what she\u0027d been waiting for.\\n\\n Now she moved forward, olive-fleshed. She must be wearing stockings; a T-shirt, too, rolled up to show her navel. Sexy, dismembered by darkness, her thighs, belly and navel floated towards him, hips moving languidly, green-striped. She got onto the bed, kneeling, her thighs opening, and inched forward. The dark cleft was visible in her bush of pubic hair. She was so silent. And so light. The bed did not sink in where she crept towards him. Harry wondered: how does she do that?\\n\\n She began to lower herself onto him - slowly, so slowly - the dark cleft widening as her body settled to its target. He arched his back, straining up towards her... but why couldn\u0027t he feel her knees gripping his hips? Why was she so weightless?\\n\\n Then, suddenly and without warning, his flesh was crawling. Lust fled him in a moment. For somehow -instinctively, intuitively - he knew that this was not Sandra. And worse, he knew that he couldn\u0027t rightly say what it was!\\n\\n His left hand fumblingly found the light cord, pulled it.\\n\\n Light flooded the room blindingly.\\n\\n At the same time the cleft in her bush of pubic hair sprang open like a mechanical thing. White-gleaming, yawning jaws of salivating needle teeth set in bulging, obscenely glistening pink gums shot down from the gaping lips to snap shut on him in a vice of shearing agony!\\n\\n Harry screamed, rammed himself backwards in his bed, banged his head savagely on the headboard. Galvanized, his hands stabbed out, striking murderously for a face, a throat - striking instinctively at features... which weren\u0027t there!\\n\\n Above the navel, nothing! And below the upper thighs, nothing!\\n\\n She - it - was a lower abdomen, a disembodied vagina with cannibal teeth which were chomping on him! And his blood hot and red and spurting as the thing feasted on his genitals and munched them up like so much slop. And a crimson eye that snapped suddenly open, glaring at Harry from the orbit which he had mistaken for a navel!\\n\\n \u0027And that\u0027s it, Harry?\u0027 Dr David Bettley, an E-Branch empath retired early for the sake of his shaky heart, gazed at his visitor from beneath half-lowered, bushy eyebrows.\\n\\n \u0027Isn\u0027t it enough?\u0027 the other answered, with some animation. \u0027Christ, it was enough for me! It scared the living daylights out of me. Yes, even out of me! I mean, don\u0027t think I\u0027m bragging but that\u0027s no easy thing to do. It\u0027s just that this damn dream was so ... so real! We all have nightmares, but this one...\u0027He shook his head, gave an involuntary shudder.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I can see how badly it affected you,\u0027 said Bettley, concernedly. \u0027But when I say \"that\u0027s it\", it isn\u0027t to make light of your experience. I\u0027m simply asking, was there any more?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Harry shook his head, \u0027for that\u0027s when I actually came awake. But if you mean more reaction to it? You\u0027d better believe there was! Look, I was weak as a kitten. I\u0027m sure I was in shock. I felt physically sick, almost threw up. Also, I emptied my bowels - and I\u0027m not ashamed to admit that I only just made it to the toilet! I don\u0027t mean to be crude, but that dream literally scared the shit out of me!\u0027 He paused, slumped back in his chair and lost a little of his animation. He looked tired, Bettley thought.\\n\\n But eventually he struggled upright again and continued. \u0027Afterwards ... I prowled the house with all the lights blazing, with a meat cleaver in my hand. I searched for the thing everywhere. For an hour, two, until full daylight. And most of that time I was shaking like a leaf. It was only when I\u0027d stopped shaking that I finally convinced myself it was a dream.\u0027 He suddenly laughed, but his laughter was shaky even now. \u0027Hey! - I nearly called the police. Can you picture that? I mean, you\u0027re a psychiatrist, but how do you think they\u0027d have taken my story, eh? Maybe I\u0027d have been in to see you a day or two earlier!\u0027\\n\\n Dr Bettley steepled his fingers and stared deep into the other\u0027s eyes. Harry Keogh was maybe forty-three or -four (his body, anyway) but looked five years younger. Except Bettley knew that his mind was in fact five years younger again! It was a weird business dealing with - even looking at - a man like Harry Keogh. For Bettley had known this face and body before, when it belonged to Alec Kyle.\\n\\n The doctor shook his head and blinked, then deliberately avoided Harry\u0027s eyes. It was just that sometimes they could be so very soulful, those eyes of his.\\n\\n As for the rest of him:\\n\\n Harry\u0027s body had been well-fleshed, maybe even a little overweight, once. With its height, however, that hadn\u0027t mattered a great deal. Not to Alec Kyle, whose job with E-Branch had been in large part sedentary. But it had mattered to Harry. After that business at the Chateau Bronnitsy - his metempsychosis - he\u0027d trained his new body down, got it to a peak of perfection. Or at least done as best he could with it, considering its age. That\u0027s why it looked only thirty-seven or -eight years old. But better still if it was only thirty-two, like the mind inside it. A very confusing business, and the doctor shook his head and blinked again.\\n\\n \u0027So what do you make of it?\u0027 Keogh asked. \u0027Could it be part of my problem?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your problem?\u0027 Bettley repeated him. \u0027Oh, I\u0027m sure it is. I\u0027m sure it could only be part of your problem - unless of course you haven\u0027t put me fully in the picture.\u0027\\n\\n Harry raised an eyebrow.\\n\\n \u0027About your feelings towards Sandra. You\u0027ve mentioned a certain ambivalence, a lack of desire, even a slackening of potency. It could be that you\u0027re taking your loss out on her - mentally, inside your head - blaming her for the fact that you\u0027re no longer...\u0027 He paused.\\n\\n \u0027A Necroscope?\u0027 Harry prompted.\\n\\n \u0027Possibly,\u0027 Bettley shrugged. \u0027But ... on the other hand you also seem ambivalent towards your loss. I have to tell you that sometimes I get the feeling you\u0027re glad it\u0027s gone, glad you can no longer talk to... to...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To the dead,\u0027 said Harry, sourly. And: \u0027Well, you\u0027re half-right. Sometimes it\u0027s good to be just normal, ordinary. Let\u0027s face it, most people would consider me a freak, even a monster. So you\u0027re half-right. But you\u0027re also half-wrong.\u0027 He lay back in the chair again, closed his eyes and stroked his brow.\\n\\n Bettley went back to studying him.\\n\\n Grey streaks, so evenly spaced as to seem deliberately designed or affected, were plentiful in Harry\u0027s russet-brown, naturally wavy hair. It wouldn\u0027t be too many years before the grey overtook the brown; even now it loaned him a certain erudite appearance, gave him the look of a scholar. Ah, but in what strange and esoteric subjects? And yet Harry wasn\u0027t like that at all. What, a black magician? A 20th-century wizard? A necromancer? No, just a Necroscope, a man who talked to the dead - or used to.\\n\\n Of course, he had other talents, too. Bettley looked at him sitting there, so tired-looking, his hand to his brow. The places this man had been! The means he\u0027d used to go there, and to return. What other man had ever used an obscure mathematical concept as a ... a spaceship, or a time-machine?\\n\\n Harry opened his eyes and caught Bettley staring at him. He said nothing, merely stared back. That\u0027s what he was here for: to be stared at, to be examined. And Bettley was good at his job, and discreet. Everybody said so. He had many admirable qualities. Must have, else INTESP would never have taken him on. And again Harry wondered: is he still working for them? Not that it would matter a great deal, for Bettley was easy to talk to. It was just that Harry so hated subterfuge.\\n\\n The doctor continued to stare into Harry\u0027s eyes. They were soulful as ever, and somehow defensive; but at the same time it seemed that Harry needed this close contact. Honey-brown, those eyes; very wide, very intelligent, and (strange beyond words) very innocent! Genuinely innocent, Bettley knew. Harry Keogh had not asked to be what he was, or to be called upon to do the things he\u0027d done.\\n\\n Bettley forced himself back to the job in hand. \u0027So I\u0027m half-wrong,\u0027 he said. \u0027You would like your talents back, to be a \"freak\" again - your words, Harry. But what will you do with those talents if they do return to you? How will you use them?\u0027\\n\\n Harry gave a wry smile. His teeth were good and strong, not quite white, a little uneven; they were set in a mouth which was usually sensitive but could tighten, becoming caustic and even cruel. Or perhaps not so much cruel as unyielding, single-minded.\\n\\n \u0027You know, I scarcely knew my mother,\u0027 he dreamily answered. \u0027I was too young, just a baby, when she died. But I got to know her... later. And I miss her. A boy\u0027s best friend is his mum, you know? And... well, I have a lot of friends down there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In the ground?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Hell, we had some good conversations!\u0027\\n\\n Bettley almost shuddered, fought it down. \u0027You miss talking to them?\u0027\\n\\n \"They had their problems, wanted to air their views, wondered how things had gone in the world of the living. Some of them worried a lot, about people they\u0027d left behind. I was able to reassure them. But most were merely lonely. Merely! But I knew what it was like for them. I could feel it. It was hell to be that lonely. They needed me; I was somebody to them; and I suppose I miss them needing me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But none of this explains your dream,\u0027 the doctor mused. \u0027Maybe it has no explanation - except fear. You\u0027ve lost your friends, your skills, those parts of yourself that made you unique. And now you\u0027re afraid of losing your manhood.\u0027\\n\\n Harry narrowed his eyes a little and began to pay more attention; he looked at Bettley more piercingly. \u0027Explain.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But isn\u0027t it obvious? A disembodied female Thing - a dead thing, a vampire thing - devours your core, the parts of you that make you a man. She was Fear, your fear, pure but not so simple. Her vampire nature was straight out of your own past experience. You don\u0027t like being normal and the more you have to endure it the more afraid of it you get to be. It\u0027s all tied up to your past, Harry: it\u0027s all the things you\u0027ve lost until you\u0027re afraid of losing anything else. You lost your mother when you were a child, lost your own wife and child in an unreachable place, lost so many friends and even your own body! And finally you\u0027ve lost your talents. No more M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum, no more talking to the dead, no more Necroscope...\u0027\\n\\n Harry was frowning now. \u0027What you said about vampires made me remember something,\u0027 he said. \u0027Several things, in fact.\u0027 He went back to rubbing his brow.\\n\\n \u0027Go on,\u0027 Bettley prompted him.\\n\\n \u0027I have to start some way back,\u0027 Harry continued, \u0027when I was a kid at Harden Modern Boys. That\u0027s a school. I was a Necroscope even then, but it wasn\u0027t something I much liked. It used to make me dizzy, sick even. I mean it came naturally to me, but I knew it wasn\u0027t. I knew it was very unnatural. But even before that I used to ... well, see things.\u0027\\n\\n Bettley was an empath; now he felt something of what Harry felt and the short hairs began to rise at the back of his neck. This was going to be important. He glanced down at a button on his side of the desk: it was still red, the tape was still running. \u0027What sort of things?\u0027 he asked, hiding his eagerness.\\n\\n \u0027I was an infant when my stepfather killed my mother,\u0027 the other answered. \u0027I wasn\u0027t on the scene, and even if I had been I wasn\u0027t old enough for it to impress me. I couldn\u0027t possibly have understood what was happening, and almost certainly I wouldn\u0027t have remembered it. And I couldn\u0027t have reconstructed it later from overheard conversations because Shukshin\u0027s account of the \"accident\" had been accepted. There was no question of his having murdered her - except from me. It was a nightmare I used to have: of him holding her there under the ice, until she drifted away. And I saw the ring on his finger: a cat\u0027s-eye set in a thick gold band. It came off when he drowned her and sank to the bottom of the river, and fifteen years later I knew where to go back and dive for it.\u0027\\n\\n Bettley felt a tingling in his spine. \u0027But you were a Necroscope - the Necroscope - and read it out of your dead mother\u0027s mind. Surely?\u0027\\n\\n Harry shook his head. \u0027No, because it was a dream I had from a time long before I first consciously talked to the dead. And in it I \"remembered\" something I couldn\u0027t possibly remember. It was a talent I\u0027d had without even recognizing it. You know my mother was a psychic medium, and her mother, too? Maybe it was something that came down from them. But as my greater talent - as a Necroscope - developed, so this other thing was pushed into the background, got lost.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you think all of this has something to do with this new dream of yours? In what way?\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s shrug was lighter, no longer defeatist. \u0027You know how when someone goes blind he seems to develop a sixth sense? And people handicapped from birth, how they seem to make up for their deficiencies in other ways?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 the doctor answered. \u0027Some of the greatest musicians the world\u0027s ever seen have been deaf or blind. But what...?\u0027 And then he snapped his fingers. \u0027I see! So you think that the loss of your other talents has caused this... this atrophied one to start growing again, is that it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe,\u0027 Harry nodded, \u0027maybe. Except I\u0027m not just seeing things from the past any more but from the future. My future. But vaguely, unformed except as nightmares.\u0027\\n\\n It was Bettley\u0027s turn to frown. \u0027A precog, is that what you think you\u0027re becoming? But what has this to do with vampires, Harry?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was my dream,\u0027 the other answered. \u0027Something I\u0027d forgotten, or hadn\u0027t wanted to remember, until you brought it back to me. But now I remember it clearly. I can see it clearly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just a little thing,\u0027 Harry shrugged again, perhaps defensively.\\n\\n \u0027But best if we have it out in the open, right?\u0027 Bettley spoke quietly, clearing the way for Harry without openly urging him on.\\n\\n \u0027Perhaps.\u0027 And in a sudden rush of words: \u0027I saw red threads! The scarlet life-threads of vampires!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In your dream?\u0027 Bettley shivered as gooseflesh crept on his back and forearms. \u0027Where in your dream?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In the green stripes where the light came through the blinds,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027The stripes on her belly and thighs, in the moment before that hellish thing fastened on me. They were green-tinted, almost submarine, but as my blood began to spurt they turned red. Red stripes streaming off her body into the dim past, and also into the future. Writhing red threads among the blue life-threads of humanity. Vampires!\u0027\\n\\n The doctor said nothing, waited, felt the other\u0027s horror - and fascination - washing out from him, welling into the study like a sick, almost tangible flood tide. Until Harry shook his head and cut off the flow. Then, abruptly, he stood up and headed a little unsteadily for the door.\\n\\n \u0027Harry?\u0027 Bettley called after him.\\n\\n At the door Harry turned. \u0027I\u0027m wasting your time,\u0027 he said. \u0027As usual. Let\u0027s face it, you could be right and I\u0027m frightened of my own shadow. Self-pity, because I\u0027m nothing special any more. And maybe scared because I know what could be out there waiting for me, but \u0027 probably isn\u0027t. But what the hell - what will be will be, we know that. And the time is long past when I could do anything about it or change any part of it.\u0027\\n\\n Bettley shook his head in denial. \u0027It wasn\u0027t a waste, Harry, not if we got something out of it. And it seems to me we got a lot out of it.\u0027\\n\\n The other nodded. \u0027Thanks anyway,\u0027 he said, and closed the door behind him. The doctor got up and moved to his window. Shortly, down below, Harry left the building and stepped out into Princes Street in the heart of Edinburgh. He turned up his coat collar against the squalling rain, tucked his chin in and angled his back to the bluster, then stepped to the kerb and hailed a taxi. A moment later and the car had whirled him away.\\n\\n Bettley returned to his desk, sat down and sighed. Now he was the one who felt weak; but Keogh\u0027s psychic essence - a near-tangible \u0027echo\u0027 of his presence - was already fading. When it had faded into nothing, the empath rewound his interview tape and dialled a special number at INTESP HQ in London. He waited until he got a signal, then placed the handset into a cradle on the tape machine under his desk. At the press of a button, Harry\u0027s interview began playing itself into storage at E-Branch.\\n\\n Along with all of his other interviews...\\n\\n In the back of the taxi on the way to Bonnyrig, Harry relaxed and closed his eyes, leaned his head against the seat and tried to recall something of that other dream which had bothered him on and off for the last three or four years, the one about Harry Jnr. He knew what the dream was in essence - what had been done to him, how and why - but its fine detail eluded him. The what and how part was obvious: by use of the Wamphyri art of fascination, hypnotism, Harry Jnr had made his father an ex-Necroscope, at the same time removing or cancelling his ability to enter and manoeuvre in the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. As to why he\u0027d done it:\\n\\n You would destroy me if you could, he heard his son\u0027s voice again, like a record played a hundred times, until he knew every word and phrase, every mood and emotion or lack of it, by heart. Don\u0027t deny it, for I can see it in your eyes, smell it on your breath, read it in your mind. I know your mind well, father. Almost as well as you do. I\u0027ve explored every part of it, remember?\\n\\n And now, under his breath, Harry answered again as he\u0027d answered then: \u0027But if you know that much, then you know I\u0027d never harm you. I don\u0027t want to destroy you, only to cure you.\u0027\\n\\n As you \"cured\" the Lady Karen? And where is she now, father? It hadn\u0027t been an accusation; there\u0027d been no sarcasm in it, no sourness; it was just a statement of fact. For the Lady Karen had killed herself, which Harry Jnr knew well enough.\\n\\n \u0027The thing had taken too strong a hold on her,\u0027 Harry had insisted. \u0027Also, she\u0027d been a peasant, a Traveller, without your understanding. She couldn\u0027t see what she\u0027d gained, only what she thought she\u0027d lost. She didn\u0027t have to kill herself. Maybe she was... unbalanced?\u0027\\n\\n You know she wasn\u0027t. She was simply Wamphyri. And you drove her vampire out and killed it. You thought it would be like killing a tapeworm, like lancing a boil or curing out a cancer. But it wasn\u0027t. You say she couldn\u0027t see what she\u0027d gained. Now tell me, father, what you think the Lady Karen had gained?\\n\\n \u0027Her freedom!\u0027 Harry had cried in desperation, and in sudden horror of himself. \u0027For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t prove me wrong in what I did! I\u0027m no bloody murderer!\u0027\\n\\n No, you\u0027re not. But you are a man with an obsession. And I\u0027m afraid of you. Or if not afraid of you, afraid of your goals, your ambitions. You want a world - your world-free of vampirism. An entirely admirable objective. But when you\u0027ve achieved that aim... what then? Will my world be next? An obsession, yes, which seems to be growing in you even as my vampire is growing in me. I\u0027m Wamphyri now, father, and there\u0027s nothing so tenacious as a vampire - unless it\u0027s Harry Keogh himself!\\n\\n Can\u0027t you see how dangerous you are to me? You know many of the secret arts of the Wamphyri, and how to destroy them; you can talk to the dead, travel in the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum - even in time itself, however ephemerally. I ran away from you, from your world, once. But now, in this world, I\u0027ve fought for my territories and earned them. They\u0027re mine now and I\u0027ll not desert them. I\u0027ll run no more. But I can\u0027t take the chance that you won\u0027t come after me, daren\u0027t accept the risk that you won\u0027t be satisfied. I\u0027m Wamphyri! I\u0027ll not suffer your experiments. I\u0027ll not be a guinea pig for any more \"cures\" you might come up with.\\n\\n \u0027And what of me?\u0027 Harry had spoken up then, even as he now whispered the words to himself. \u0027How safe will I be? I\u0027m a threat to you, you\u0027ve admitted as much. How long before your vampire is ascendant and you come looking for me?\u0027\\n\\n But that won\u0027t happen, father. I\u0027m not a peasant; I do have knowledge; I shall control myself as a clever addict controls his addiction.\\n\\n \u0027And if it gets out of control? You, too, are a Necroscope. And in the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum there\u0027s nothing you can\u0027t do, nowhere you can\u0027t go, and always carrying your contamination with you. What poor bastard will get your egg, son?\u0027\\n\\n At which Harry Jnr had sighed heavily and taken off his golden mask. His scars from the battle in the Garden had healed now; there was nothing much to be seen of them; his vampire had been busy repairing him, moulding his flesh as his father feared it would one day mould his will. So you see we\u0027re at stalemate, he\u0027d said. And his eyes had opened into huge crimson orbs.\\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027 Harry gasped out loud, now as he\u0027d gasped it then. Except that then it had been the last thing he\u0027d said for quite some time, until he\u0027d woken up at E-Branch HQ. Whereas now:\\n\\n \u0027Whazzat, Chief?\u0027 his dour-faced driver, puzzled and frowning, glanced back at him. \u0027But did ye no say Bonnyrig? Ah surely hope so, \u0027cos we\u0027re a\u0027most there!\u0027\\n\\n The real world crashed down on Harry. He was sitting upright, stiff and pale, with his bottom jaw hanging slightly open. He licked his dry lips and looked out through the taxi\u0027s windows. Yes, they were almost there. And:\\n\\n \u0027Bonnyrig, yes, of course,\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027I was ... I was daydreaming, that\u0027s all.\u0027 And he directed the other through the village and to his house.\\n\\n North London in late April 1989; a fairly rundown bottom-floor flat in the otherwise \u0027upwardly mobile\u0027 district of Highgate just off Hornsey Lane; two men, apparently relaxed, talking quietly over drinks in a large sitting-room lined with bookshelves full of books and many small items of foreign, mainly European bric-a-brac...\\n\\n Very untypical of his race, Nikolai Zharov was slender as a wand, pale as milk, almost effeminate in his affectations. He used a cigarette holder to smoke Marlboros with their filters torn off, spoke excellent English albeit with a slight lisp, and had in general a rather limp-wristed air. His eyes were dark, deep-set and heavy-lidded, giving him an almost-drugged appearance which belied the alert and ever calculating nature of his brain.\\n\\n His hair was thin and black, swept back, lacquered down with some antiseptic-smelling Russian preparation; under a thin, straight nose his lips were also thin in a too-wide mouth. A pointed chin completed his lean look; he appeared the sort who might easily bend but never break; \u0027real men\u0027 might be tempted to look at him askance but they wouldn\u0027t push their luck with him. Out in the city\u0027s streets Zharov would certainly warrant a second glance, following which the observer would very likely look away. The Russian tended to make people feel uneasy.\\n\\n He made Wellesley uneasy, for a fact, though the latter tried hard to conceal it. As owner of the flat, Wellesley was worried someone might have seen his visitor coming here, or even followed him. Which would be one hell of a difficult thing to explain away. For Wellesley was a player in the Intelligence Game, and so was Zharov, though ostensibly they worked for different bosses.\\n\\n At five feet eight inches tall Norman Harold Wellesley was some five or six inches shorter than the spindly Russian; he had more meat on him, too, and more colour in his face. Too much colour. But it wasn\u0027t his stature or mildly choleric mottling that put him at a disadvantage. His current mental agitation hailed not so much from physical or even cultural disparities of race and type as from fear pure and simple. Fear of what Zharov was asking him to do. In answer to which he had just this moment replied:\\n\\n \u0027But you must know that\u0027s plainly out of the question, not feasible, indeed little short of impossible!\u0027 Explosive-seeming words, yet uttered quietly, coldly, even with a measure of calculation. A calculated attempt to dissuade Zharov from his course, or perhaps re-route it a little, even knowing that he wasn\u0027t the author of the \u0027request\u0027 he\u0027d made but merely the delivery boy.\\n\\n And the Russian had obviously expected as much. \u0027Wrong,\u0027 he answered, just as quietly, but with something of a cold smile to counter the other\u0027s flush. \u0027Not only is it entirely possible but imperative. If as you have reported Harry Keogh is on the verge of developing new and hitherto unsuspected talents, then he must be stopped. It is as simple as that. He has been a veritable plague on Soviet ESPionage, Norman. A disaster, a mental hurricane ... a psiclone? Oh, our E-Branch survives, lives on despite all his efforts, but barely.\u0027 Zharov shrugged. \u0027On the other hand, perhaps we should be grateful to him: his, er, successes have made us more than ever aware of the power of parapsychology - its importance - in the field of spying. The problem is that as a weapon he gives your side far too much of an edge. Which is why he has to go.\u0027\\n\\n If Wellesley had been paying any real attention to Zharov\u0027s argument it hardly showed. \u0027You will recall,\u0027 he now started to reply, \u0027 -1 mean, you have probably been informed - that my initial liability was a small one? Very well, I owe your masters a small favour - I\u0027m in their debt, let\u0027s say - but not such a large debt even now. And their interest rates are way too high, my friend. Beyond my limited ability to pay. I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s my answer, Nikolai, which you must take back with you to Moscow.\u0027\\n\\n Zharov sighed, put down his drink and leaned back in his chair. He stretched his long legs, folded his arms across his chest and pursed his lips; he allowed his heavy eyelids to droop more yet. The pupils of his dark eyes glinted from their cores, and for several long moments he studied Wellesley where he was seated on the opposite side of a small occasional table.\\n\\n Wellesley\u0027s red hair was receding fast. At forty-five he was perhaps six or seven years the Russian\u0027s senior, and looked every day of it. A generally unattractive man, his one redeeming feature was his mouth: it was firm, well-shaped and housed an immaculate set of teeth. Other than that his nose was bulbous and fleshy, his watery blue eyes too round and staring, and his excess of colouring brought the large freckles of his forehead into glaring yellow prominence. Zharov concentrated on Wellesley\u0027s freckles a moment more before straightening up again.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, detente!\u0027 he tut-tutted. \u0027Glasnost! What have they brought us to when we must bargain with debtors? Why, in the good old days we would simply send in the debt-collectors! Or perhaps the bully-boys? But now ... the gentleman\u0027s way out: bankruptcy, receivership! Norman, I\u0027m very much afraid you\u0027re about to go bankrupt. Your cover is about to be - \u0027 he formed his mouth into a tube and puffed cigarette smoke through it in a series of perfect rings,\u0027 - blown!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cover?\u0027 Wellesley\u0027s eyes narrowed suspiciously and his colour deepened more yet. \u0027I have no cover. I am what I appear to be. Look, I made a mistake and I understand I must pay for it. Fine - but I\u0027m not about to kill for you! Oh, you\u0027d like that, wouldn\u0027t you - for me to turn a small debt into a massive great overdraft! But it\u0027s not on, Nikolai. So go ahead, Comrade, drop me in it. \"Bankrupt\" me, if that\u0027s the threat. I\u0027ll lose my job and maybe my liberty for a while, but not forever. But if I play your game I\u0027m a goner. I\u0027d be in even deeper. And what will it be next time, eh? More treachery? Another murder? What you\u0027re doing is blackmail and you know it, but I\u0027m not having any. So do your worst and kiss any \"favours\" I owe you goodbye forever!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bluff,\u0027 Zharov smiled. \u0027And nicely played, too. But bluff all the same.\u0027 His smile fell from his face and he stood up. \u0027Very well, I call: you are a mole, a sleeper!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A sleeper?\u0027 Wellesley\u0027s fists shook where he held them clenched at his sides. \u0027Well, and maybe I was - but never activated. I\u0027ve done nothing wrong.\u0027\\n\\n Zharov smiled again but it was more a grimace. He gave a small shrug of his thin shoulders and headed for the door. \u0027That will be your side of it, of course.\u0027\\n\\n Wellesley jumped to his feet and got to the door first. \u0027And where the hell do you think you\u0027re going?\u0027 he rasped. \u0027We\u0027ve resolved nothing!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have said all I had to say,\u0027 said the other, coming to a halt and standing perfectly still. After a moment\u0027s pause he carefully reached out and took his overcoat from a peg. \u0027And now - \u0027 his voice had deepened a little and his thin mouth twitched in one corner,\u0027 - now I am leaving.\u0027 He took thin, black leather gloves from a pocket of the overcoat and swiftly pulled them on. \u0027And will you try to stop me, Norman? Believe me, that would be something of an error.\u0027\\n\\n Wellesley had never been much for the physical side of things; he believed the other well enough. He backed off a little, said: \u0027So what will happen now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I shall report your reticence,\u0027 Zharov was forthright. \u0027I shall say you no longer consider your debt outstanding, that you wish it written off. And they shall reply: no, we wish him written off! Your file will be \"leaked\" to someone of responsibility in one of your own intelligence branches, and -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My file?\u0027 Wellesley\u0027s watery eyes began a rapid, nervous blinking. \u0027A few dirty pictures of me and a whore snapped through one-way glass in a grubby Moscow hotel all of twelve years ago? Why, in those days that sort of stuff was ten-a-penny! It was dealt with on a day-to-day basis. Tomorrow I shall go and make a clean breast of that old ... affair! And what will your side do then, eh? Moreover, I\u0027ll name names - yours specifically - and there\u0027ll be no more courier jobs for you, Nikolai!\u0027\\n\\n Zharov gave a small, sad shake of his head. \u0027Your file is somewhat thicker than that, Norman. Why, it\u0027s quite full of little tidbits of intelligence information you\u0027ve passed on to us over the years. Make a clean breast of it? Oh, I should think you\u0027ll be doing that - or at least trying to - for quite a few years to come.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tidbits of - ?\u0027 Wellesley was now almost purple. \u0027I\u0027ve given you nothing - not a thing! What tidbits of - ?\u0027\\n\\n Zharov watched him shaking like a leaf, shaking from a combination of rage and frustration; and slowly the Russian\u0027s smile returned. 7 know you\u0027ve given us nothing,\u0027 he said, quietly. \u0027Until now we haven\u0027t asked for anything. I also know you\u0027re innocent, more or less - but the people who count don\u0027t. And now, finally, we are asking for something. So you can either pay up, or ...\" And again his shrug. \u0027It\u0027s your life, my friend.\u0027\\n\\n As Zharov reached to open the door Wellesley caught at his arm. \u0027I need to think about it,\u0027 he gasped.\\n\\n \u0027Fair enough, only don\u0027t take too long.\u0027\\n\\n Wellesley nodded, gulped: \u0027Don\u0027t go out that way. Go out the back.\u0027 He led the way through the flat. \u0027How did you come here anyway? Christ, if anyone saw you, I - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027No one saw me, Norman. And anyway, I\u0027m not much known over here. I was at a casino in the Cromwell Road. I came by taxi and let him drop me off a few blocks away. I walked. Now I shall walk again, and eventually get another cab.\u0027\\n\\n Wellesley let him out the back door and went with him down the dark garden path to the gate. Before pulling the gate to behind him, Zharov took out a manila envelope from his overcoat pocket and handed it over. \u0027Some photographs you haven\u0027t seen before,\u0027 he said. \u0027Just a reminder that you shouldn\u0027t take too long making up your mind, Norman. We\u0027re in a bit of a hurry, as you see. And don\u0027t try to contact me; I shall be in touch with you. Meanwhile... I\u0027ll have a night or two to kill. I might even find myself a nice clean whore.\u0027 He chuckled dryly. \u0027And if your lot take any pictures of me with her... why, I\u0027ll just keep them as souvenirs!\u0027\\n\\n When he\u0027d gone Wellesley went shakily back indoors. He freshened up his drink and sat down, then took out the photographs from their envelope. To anyone who didn\u0027t know better they\u0027d seem to be blowups of simple snapshots. But Wellesley knew better, and so would just about any agent or officer of British Intelligence - or of any of the world\u0027s intelligence agencies, for that matter. The pictures were of Wellesley and a much older man. They wore overcoats and Russian fur hats, walked together, chatted in a scene where the spiral cupolas of Red Square were prominent over red-tiled rooftops, drank vodka seated on the steps of a dacha. Half-a-dozen shots in all, and it would seem they were bosom pals.\\n\\n Wellesley\u0027s older \u0027friend\u0027 would be in his mid-sixties: he was grey at the temples with a central stripe of jet-black hair swept back from a high, much-wrinkled brow. He had small eyes under bushy black eyebrows, lots of laughter lines in the corners of his eyes and lips, and a hard mouth in a face which was otherwise quite jolly. Well, and he had been a jolly sort of chap in his way -and jolly murderous in other ways! Wellesley\u0027s lips silently formed his name: Borowitz, then spoke it out loud: \u0027Comrade General Gregor Borowitz - you old bastard! God, what a fool I was!\u0027\\n\\n One picture was especially interesting, if only for its scenery: Wellesley and Borowitz standing in the courtyard of an old mansion or chateau, a place of debased heritage and mixed architectural antecedents. It had twin minarets jutting upwards like rotting phallus mushrooms from steeply-gabled end walls; their flaking spiral decorations and sagging parapets added to a general sense of decay and dereliction. But in fact the chateau had been anything but derelict.\\n\\n Wellesley had never been inside the place, hadn\u0027t even known what it housed, not then. But he knew well enough now. It was the Chateau Bronnitsy, Soviet mindspy HQ, an infamous place - until Harry Keogh had blown it to hell. It was a pity he hadn\u0027t done it just a couple of years earlier, that\u0027s all...\\n\\n The next morning, Darcy Clarke was late for work. A bad traffic accident on the North Circular, traffic-light failure in the centre of town, and finally some dumb bastard\u0027s rust-bucket parked in Darcy\u0027s space. He\u0027d been about to let the air out of the offender\u0027s tyres when he turned up, said, \u0027Fuck you!\u0027 to Clarke\u0027s raving and drove off.\\n\\n Still fuming, Clarke used the elevator discreetly placed at the rear of an otherwise perfectly normal-looking upmarket hotel to climb up to the top floor, which in its soundproof, burglar-proof, mundane-, mechanical-, and metaphysics-proofed entirety housed E-Branch, also known as INTESP. As he let himself in and shrugged out of his coat, last night\u0027s Duty Officer was just leaving for home.\\n\\n Abel Angstrom gave Clarke the once-over and said, \u0027Morning, Darcy. All hot and bothered, are you? You will be!\u0027\\n\\n Clarke grimaced and hung up his coat. \u0027Nothing can go wrong that hasn\u0027t already,\u0027 he grunted. \u0027What\u0027s up?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Boss,\u0027 Angstrom told him. That\u0027s what\u0027s up. He\u0027s been up since 6:30, locked in his office with the Keogh file. Drinking coffee by the gallon! He\u0027s watching the clock, too - been gripping each and every guy who\u0027s come in after 8:00 a.m. He wants you, so if I were you I\u0027d wear my flak-jacket!\u0027\\n\\n Clarke groaned, said, \u0027Thanks for the warning,\u0027 went to the gents and tidied himself up a little.\\n\\n Straightening his tie in a mirror, suddenly everything boiled over. To himself he rasped: \u0027What the bloody hell - ? Why do I bother? Dog\u0027s-bloody-body Clarke! And Himself wants to see me, does he? Shit and damnation - it\u0027s like being in the bloody Army!\u0027 He deliberately unstraightened his tie, mussed his hair, looked at himself again.\\n\\n There, that was better. And come to think of it, what did he have to fear anyway? Answer, nothing; for Clarke had a psi-talent no one had positively tagged yet; it kept him out of trouble, protecting him as a mother protects her child. He wasn\u0027t quite a deflector: fire a gun at him and your bullets wouldn\u0027t swerve, you\u0027d simply miss him. Or the firing-pin would come down on duds. Or he\u0027d somehow stumble at just the right moment. He was the opposite of accident-prone. He could walk through a minefield and come out unscathed... and yet he still switched off the current to change a light-bulb! Except this morning he wasn\u0027t in the mood for switching off anything. Let it all hang out, he thought, heading for the Sanctum Sanctorum.\\n\\n When he knocked on the door a surly voice said: \u0027Who?\u0027\\n\\n Arrogant bastard! he thought. \u0027Darcy Clarke.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come in, Clarke,\u0027 and as he passed inside: \u0027Where the hell have you been? I mean, do you work here or not?\u0027 And before he could answer: \u0027Sit down...\u0027\\n\\n But Clarke remained standing. He didn\u0027t need this. He\u0027d had it, taken all he could take of his new boss in the six months the man had been the head of E-Branch. Hell, there were other jobs; he didn\u0027t have to work for this overbearing bastard. And where was the continuity? Sir Keenan Gormley had been a gentleman; Alec Kyle a friend; under Clarke himself the Branch had been efficient and friendly - to its friends, anyway. But this bloke was... hell, a boor! Gauche! A primitive! Certainly as far as internal relationships - man management - were concerned. As for talents: so what was the guy? A scryer, telepath, deflector, locator? No, his talent was simply that his mind was impenetrable: telepaths couldn\u0027t touch him. Some would say that made him the ideal man for the job. Maybe it did. But it would be nice if he was human, too. After serving under such men as Gormley and Kyle, working for someone like Norman Harold Wellesley was �C\\n\\n Wellesley was seated at his desk. Without looking up he sighed, took a deep breath, and said: \u0027I said -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right, I heard you,\u0027 Clarke cut him short. \u0027Good morning to you, too.\u0027\\n\\n Now Wellesley looked up, and Clarke saw that he was his usual, florid self. He also saw the file on Harry Keogh spread every which way across the surface of Wellesley\u0027s desk. And for the first time he wondered what was going on.\\n\\n Wellesley saw Clarke\u0027s attitude at once, knew it wouldn\u0027t be wise to try riding roughshod over him this morning. Also, he knew there was a power-struggle coming up, that it had been in the wind ever since he took over here. But that was something he didn\u0027t need, not right now, anyway.\\n\\n \u0027All right, Darcy,\u0027 he said, tempering his tone a little, \u0027so we\u0027ve both been having a bad time. You\u0027re the second in command, I know that, and you believe you\u0027re due some respect. Fine, but when things go wrong - and while we\u0027re all running round being nice and respectful - I\u0027m the one who carries the can. However you feel about it, I still have to run this place. And with this kind of job... who needs an excuse to be ill-mannered? That\u0027s my story. So how come you got out of the wrong side of bed this morning?\u0027\\n\\n Clarice thought: What? When did he last call me Darcy? Is he actually trying to be reasonable, for Christ\u0027s sake?\\n\\n He allowed himself to be mollified, partly, and sat down. \u0027The traffic was hell and some clown stole my parking space,\u0027 he finally answered. \u0027That\u0027s just for starters. I\u0027m also expecting a call from Rhodes - from Trevor Jordan and Ken Layard - on that drugs job; Customs and Excise, and New Scotland Yard, will want to know how things are progressing. Add to that about a dozen unanswered requests from our Minister Responsible for esper support on unsolved major crimes, routine office admin, the Russian Embassy job I\u0027m supposed to be supervising, and -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, you can skip the embassy job for one,\u0027 Wellesley was quick to break in. \u0027It\u0027s routine, unimportant. A few extra Ivans in the country? A Russian delegation? So what? Christ, we\u0027ve more on our plate than mundane snooping! But even without all that... yes, I can see you\u0027re up to your neck.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Damn right,\u0027 said Clarke. \u0027And sinking fast! So you see I wouldn\u0027t think you rude - in fact I\u0027d probably thank you - if you simply told me to piss off and get on with my job. Except I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d have called me in here if there wasn\u0027t something on your mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, no one could ever accuse you of not getting straight to the point, could they?\u0027 said Wellesley. And for once his round eyes were unblinking and less than hostile where they searched the other out. What he saw was this:\\n\\n For all his weird talent, Clarke wasn\u0027t much to look at. No one would suppose that he\u0027d ever been the boss of anything, let alone head of the most secret branch of the British Secret Services. He was Mr Nondescript, the world\u0027s most average man. Well, maybe not that indistinct, but getting on that way, certainly. Middle-height, mousey-haired, with something of a slight stoop and a small paunch - and middle-aged to boot - Clarke was just about middle of the range in every way. He had hazel eyes in a face not much given to laughter, an intense mouth and generally downcast air. And the rest of him, including his wardrobe was... medium.\\n\\n But he had run E-Branch; he\u0027d been around through some pretty hairy stuff; he\u0027d known Harry Keogh.\\n\\n \u0027Keogh,\u0027 said Wellesley, the name coming off his lips like it tasted sour. \u0027That\u0027s what\u0027s on my mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027: as if Keogh were some kind of contraption or thing and not a person at all. Clarke raised an eyebrow. \u0027Something new on Harry?\u0027 Wellesley had been monitoring Bettley\u0027s reports himself - and keeping whatever they contained to himself.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe, and maybe not,\u0027 Wellesley answered. And rapidly, so as not to allow Clarke time to think: \u0027Do you know what would happen if he got his talents back?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 and even though Clarke did have time to think, he said it anyway: \u0027you\u0027d be out of a job!\u0027\\n\\n Unexpectedly, Wellesley smiled. But it quickly faded from his face. \u0027It\u0027s always good to know where one stands,\u0027 he said. \u0027So you think he\u0027d take over E-Branch, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027With his talents he could be E-Branch!\u0027 Clarke answered. And suddenly his face lit up. \u0027Are you saying he\u0027s got them back?\u0027\\n\\n For a moment Wellesley didn\u0027t answer. Then: \u0027You were his friend, weren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027His friend?\u0027 Clarke frowned, chewed his bottom lip, began to look a little worried. No, he couldn\u0027t honestly say he\u0027d ever been a friend of Harry\u0027s, or even that he\u0027d wanted to be. There\u0027d been a time, though, when he\u0027d seen some of Harry\u0027s friends in action - and he still had nightmares about it! But at last he answered: \u0027We were... acquainted, that\u0027s all. See, most of Harry\u0027s real friends were sort of, well, dead.\u0027 He gave a shrug. \u0027That\u0027s what qualified them, sort of.\u0027\\n\\n Wellesley stared harder at him. \u0027And he actually did what these documents credit him with doing? Talked to the dead? Called corpses out of their graves? I mean, I\u0027ll grant you telepathy: I\u0027ve seen it working in our test cubicles, and in all the criminal cases the branch has dealt with in the last six months. Even your own peculiar talent, Darcy, which is well documented even if I haven\u0027t yet seen it in action. But this?\u0027 He wrinkled his bulbous nose. \u0027A damned... necromancer?\u0027\\n\\n Clarke shook his head. \u0027A Necroscope. Harry wouldn\u0027t like you to call him a necromancer. If you\u0027ve been through his file you\u0027ll know about Dragosani. He was a necromancer. The dead were frightened of him; they loathed him. But they loved Harry. Yes, he talked to them, and called them up out of their graves when that was the only way to do what he had to do. But there was no pressure involved; just for them to know he was in dire straits was often sufficient.\u0027\\n\\n Wellesley was aware that Clarke\u0027s voice had gone very quiet, and that the man himself was now quite pale. But still he pressed on. \u0027You were there in Hartlepool at the end of the Bodescu affair. You actually saw this thing?\u0027\\n\\n Clarke shuddered. \u0027I saw many... things. I smelled them, too.\u0027 He shook his head, as if to clear it of unbearable memories, and pulled himself together. \u0027So what\u0027s your problem, Norman? OK, so during your time here we\u0027ve mainly been dealing with mundane stuff. Well, that is what we deal with, mainly. As for what Harry Keogh, Gormley, Kyle and all the others came up against that time... just hope and pray it\u0027s all done with, that\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n Still Wellesley seemed unconvinced. \u0027It couldn\u0027t have been mass hypnotism, mass illusion, some kind of trick or fraud?\u0027\\n\\n Again Clarke shook his head. \u0027I have this defence-mechanism thing, remember? You might be able to fool me but not it. It only gets scared when there\u0027s something there to be scared of. It doesn\u0027t run away from harmless illusions, only from real dangers. But it sure as hell propels me away from dead people and undead people and things that would chew my fucking head off!\u0027\\n\\n For a moment Wellesley seemed lost for an answer to that. Eventually he said: \u0027Would it surprise you to know that I was totally unaware of my own talent? All ray life, I mean, until I applied for a job here?\u0027 (This was a lie, but Clarke couldn\u0027t know it.) \u0027I mean, how does one know when one has a negative talent? If it was common everyday practice for people to read other people\u0027s minds, then I\u0027d be a freak, the odd man out who couldn\u0027t do it and couldn\u0027t have it done to him. But it isn\u0027t common practice and so I had no measure for it. I only knew - or thought - that I had an interest in parapsychology, the metaphysical. Which is why I mistakenly put in for a transfer here. And then you people checked me out for suitability and discovered I kept my mind in a safe.\u0027\\n\\n Clarke looked puzzled. \u0027What are you trying to say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure myself. I suppose I\u0027m trying to explain why, as the head of E-Branch, I have so much difficulty believing in what we\u0027re doing! And when you confront me with the reality of someone like Harry Keogh... Well, I mean, parapsychology is one thing, but this is supernatural!\u0027\\n\\n Clarke grinned one of his rare grins. \u0027So you\u0027re human after all,\u0027 he said. \u0027Did you think you were alone in your confusion? Why, there\u0027s not a man or woman ever worked here who hasn\u0027t known the same doubts. If I had a pound for every time I\u0027ve thought about it - its ambiguities, inconsistencies and head-on contradictions - hell, I\u0027d be rich! What, an outfit as weird as this is? Robots and romantics? Super-science and the supernatural? Telemetry and telepathy? Computerized probability patterns and precognition? Spy-satellites and scryers? Of course you\u0027re confused. Who isn\u0027t? But that\u0027s what it\u0027s all about: gadgets and ghosts!\u0027\\n\\n Wellesley was a little happier. He\u0027d managed to get Clarke on his side for once. And with what he had in mind, that\u0027s where he had to have him. \u0027And teleportation?\u0027 he said. \u0027Was that one of Keogh\u0027s talents, too?\u0027\\n\\n Clarke nodded. \"That\u0027s what we\u0027d call it,\u0027 he said, \u0027but it wasn\u0027t like that to Harry. He simply used doors no one else knew were there. He\u0027d step in a door here and... come out somewhere else. Just about anywhere else. When I wanted to recruit him in on the Perchorsk business, I went up to Edinburgh to see him. He said OK, he\u0027d take a chance if I would. That is, if he was going up against the unknown, he wanted me to taste a little of it too. And he brought me back here through a thing he calls the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. It was quite something, but nothing I\u0027d ever want to do again.\u0027\\n\\n Wellesley sighed again and said: \u0027I think you\u0027re right. If he got his talents back, we\u0027d have to offer him my job. You\u0027d like that, right?\u0027\\n\\n Clarke shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be coy, Darcy,\u0027 Wellesley nodded, knowingly. \u0027It\u0027s plain as day. You\u0027d rather have him - or anyone - as your boss than me. But what you don\u0027t seem to realize is that I\u0027m all for it! I don\u0027t understand you or the people who work here and I don\u0027t suppose I ever will. I want out, but I know our Minister Responsible won\u0027t let me go until there\u0027s someone to replace me. You? No, because that would make it look like they made a mistake replacing you in the first place. But Harry Keogh...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Harry\u0027s had the best help we can give him,\u0027 Clarke said. \u0027We\u0027ve hypnotized him, psychoanalysed him, damn near brainwashed him. But it\u0027s gone. So what can you do for him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s more what we can do for him, Darcy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Goon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Last night I had a long talk with the Markham girl up in Edinburgh, and -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If there\u0027s one part of this that I really hate,\u0027 Clarke heatedly cut in, \u0027it\u0027s that we\u0027ve done this to him!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - And she advised me to speak to David Bettley,\u0027 Wellesley continued, unperturbed, \u0027because she\u0027s worried about Keogh. Can you understand that? She does have genuine feelings for him. It may be just a job but she is worried about him. Or maybe you think he\u0027d be better off on his own? Well, whichever, she satisfies two needs: one in Keogh, and one in us. The need to know what\u0027s on his mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The tender art of the mindspy!\u0027 Clarke snorted.\\n\\n \u0027So I took her advice and spoke to Bettley. I got him out of bed to answer his telephone. I would have contacted him anyway, about some of his most recent reports and recordings; because in them he\u0027s given me cause to believe that Keogh is (a) about to develop some strange new talent, or (b) he\u0027s on the point of cracking up. Anyway, in the course of our conversation Bettley mentioned how Keogh first discovered this, er, M\u0026ouml;bius thing - ?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - Correct. He\u0027d apparently been on the verge of it but needed a spur. Which came when the East German GREPO found him talking to M\u0026ouml;bius in a Leipzig graveyard. That did it, triggered his mathematical genius. He teleported - or used the Continuum - to escape from them. That\u0027s why I have his file here: I wanted to check that I had it right. And it\u0027s also why I\u0027m double-checking with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So?\u0027\\n\\n \"The way I see it,\u0027 Wellesley continued, \u0027Keogh\u0027s like a computer that\u0027s suffered a power failure: the information he requires - and which E-Branch wants to use - is no longer accessible to him. Oh, it\u0027s probably still in there but it\u0027s jammed in limbo. And so far we haven\u0027t been able to shake it loose.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you propose?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m still working on it. But the way I see it, if we apply just the right spur... with a bit of luck it could be Leipzig all over again. You see, Keogh has been having some bad dreams lately; and if what you say of him is true - oh, I don\u0027t doubt it, but nevertheless if - then any dream awful enough to frighten him must be really bad. But perhaps not quite bad enough, eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You want to scare him silly?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I want to scare him almost to death. So close to death that he escapes into the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum!\u0027\\n\\n Clarke sat still and silent for long moments, until eventually Wellesley leaned forward and quietly said:\\n\\n \u0027Well, what do you think?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My honest opinion?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think it stinks. Also, I think that if you plan to fool with Keogh you\u0027d better take out extra insurance. And finally I think that it had better work, because if it doesn\u0027t I\u0027m up and gone. When this is finished, no matter how it works out, I won\u0027t be able to work with you any longer.\u0027\\n\\n Wellesley smiled thinly. \u0027But you do want me out of here, right? And so you won\u0027t... hinder me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, in fact I insist on being part of it. That way I can be sure that if Harry has any breaks coming, he\u0027ll get them.\u0027\\n\\n Wellesley continued to smile. Oh, he\u0027ll get his breaks, all right, he thought. Broken all the way through, in fact!\\n\\n And he was one of only a handful of men in the entire world who could think such things - especially here in E-Branch HQ - and be certain that no one could hear him doing it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iv-deadspeak-necroscope-4/page-5.html","bookId":2437,"book":{"id":2437,"title":"Necroscope IV: Deadspeak (Necroscope #4)","description":"Storyline: Several years after his return to earth Harry Sr. is trouble by nightmares of resurgent Vampires.
