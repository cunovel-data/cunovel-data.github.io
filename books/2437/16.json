{"id":78841,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"16\n Man to Man, Face to Face\n \u0027Harry!\u0027 Someone gave his shoulder an urgent shake. \u0027Harry, wake up!\u0027\n The Necroscope came instantly awake, almost like stepping through a M\u0026ouml;bius door from one existence to another, from dream to waking. He saw the Gypsy he had spoken to and shared food with, whose blanket lay across his legs. And his first thought was: How does he know my name? Following which he relaxed. Of course he would know his name. Janos had told it to him. He would have told all of his thralls and human servants and other minion creatures the name of his greatest enemy.\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 Harry sat up.\n \u0027You\u0027ve slept an hour,\u0027 the other answered. \u0027We\u0027ll soon be moving on. I\u0027m taking my blanket. Also, there is something you should see.\u0027\n \u0027Oh?\u0027\n The Gypsy nodded. His eyes were keen now, dark and sharp. \u0027Do you have a friend who searches for you?\u0027\n \u0027What? A friend, here?\u0027 Was it possible Darcy Clarke or one of the others had followed him here from Rhodes? Harry shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t think so.\u0027\n \u0027An enemy, then, who follows on behind? In a car?\u0027\n Harry stood up. \u0027You\u0027ve seen such a one? Show me.\u0027\n \u0027Follow me,\u0027 said the other. \u0027But keep low.\u0027\n He moved at a lope through the trees to a hedgerow. Harry followed him and was aware of the other Gypsies scattered here and there throughout the encampment. Each of them to a man was silent but tense in the dappled green shade of the trees. Their belongings were all packed away. They were ready to move.\n \u0027There,\u0027 said Harry\u0027s guide. He stood aside to let the Necroscope peer through the bushes.\n On the other side of the road a man sat at the wheel of an old beetle Volkswagen, looking at the entrance to the encampment. Harry didn\u0027t know him, but ... he knew him. Now that his attention had been focussed on him, he remembered. He\u0027d been on the plane, this man. And... in Mezobereny? Possibly. That cigarette holder was a dead giveaway. Likewise his generally snaky, effeminate style. And now Harry remembered, too, that earlier brush with the Securitatea in Romania. Had this man been their contact in Rhodes? An agent, perhaps, for the USSR\u0027s E-Branch?\n He glanced at the Gypsy beside him and said, \u0027An enemy - possibly.\u0027 But then he saw the knife ready in the other\u0027s hand, and raised an eyebrow. \u0027Oh?\u0027\n The other smiled, without humour. The Szgany don\u0027t much care for silent watchers.\u0027\n But Harry wondered: had the knife been for him, if he\u0027d tried to make a run for it? A threat, to bring him to heel? \u0027What now?\u0027 he said.\n \u0027Watch,\u0027 said the other.\n A Gypsy girl in a bright dress and a shawl crossed the road to the car, and Nikolai Zharov sat up straighter at the wheel. She showed him a basket filled with trinkets, knick-knacks, and spoke to him. But he shook his head. Then he showed her some paper money and in turn spoke to her, questioningly. She took the money, nodded eagerly, pointed through the forest. Zharov frowned, questioned her again. She became more insistent, stamped her foot, pointed again in the direction of Gyula, along the forest road.\n Finally Zharov scowled, nodded, started up his car. He drove off in a cloud of dust. Harry turned to the Gypsy and said: \u0027He was an enemy, then. And the girl has sent him off on a wild goose chase?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. Now we\u0027ll be on our way.\u0027\n \u0027We?\u0027 Harry continued to stare at him.\n The man sheathed his knife. \u0027We Travellers,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Who else? If you had been awake you could have eaten with us. But - \u0027 he shrugged,\u0027 - we saved you a little soup.\u0027\n Another man approached with a bowl and wooden spoon, which he offered to Harry.\n Harry looked at it.\n Don\u0027t! said a deadspeak voice in his head, that of the dead Gypsy king.\n Poison? Harry answered. Your people are trying to kill me?\n No, they desire you to be still for an hour or two. Only drink this, and you will be still!\n And sick?\n No. Perhaps a mild soreness in the head - which a drink of clean water will drive away. But if you drink the soup... then all is lost. Across the border you\u0027ll go, and up into the ageless hills and craggy mountains - which, as you know, belong to the Old Ferenczy!\n But Harry only smiled and grunted his satisfaction. So be it, he said, and drank the soup...\n Nikolai Zharov drove as far as Gyula and midway into the town, then finally paid attention to a small niggling voice in the back of his mind: the one that was telling him, more insistently with each passing moment, that he was a fool! Finally he turned his car around and drove furiously back the way he\u0027d come. If Keogh had gone to Gyula he could check it later. But meanwhile, if the Gypsy girl had been lying...\n The Traveller camp was empty - as though the Gypsies had never been there. Zharov cursed, turned left onto the main road and gunned his engine. And up ahead he saw the first of the caravans passing leisurely through the border checkpoint.\n He arrived in a skidding of tyres, jumped from the car and ran headlong into the one-room, chalet-style building. The border policeman behind his elevated desk picked up his peaked, flat-topped hat and rammed it on his head. He glared at Zharov and the Russian glared back. Beyond the dusty, fly-specked windows, the last caravan was just passing under the raised pole.\n \u0027What?\u0027 the Russian yelled. \u0027Are you some kind of madman? What are you, Hungarian or Romanian?\u0027\n The other was young, big-bellied, red-faced. A Transylvanian village peasant, he had joined the Securitatea because it had seemed easier than farming. Not much money in it, but at least he could do a bit of bullying now and then. He quite liked bullying, but he wasn\u0027t keen on being bullied.\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 he scowled, his piggy eyes startled.\n \u0027Clown!\u0027 Zharov raged. \u0027Those Gypsies - do they simply come and go? Isn\u0027t this supposed to be a checkpoint? Does President Ceausescu know that these riff-raff pass across his borders without so much as a by your leave? Get off your fat backside; follow me; a spy is hiding in those caravans!\u0027\n The border policeman\u0027s expression had changed. For all he knew (and despite the other\u0027s harsh foreign accent), Zharov might well be some high-ranking Securitatea official; certainly he acted like one. But what was all this about spies? Flushing an even brighter red, he hurried out from behind his desk, did up a loose button on his sweat-stained blue uniform shirt, nervously fingered the two-day-old stubble on his chin. Zharov led him out of the shack, got back into his car and hurled the passenger-side door open. \u0027In!\u0027 he snapped.\n Cramming himself into the small seat, the confused man blusteringly protested: \u0027But the Travellers aren\u0027t a problem. No one ever troubles them. Why, they\u0027ve been coming this way for years! They are taking one of their own to bury him. And it can\u0027t be right to interfere with a funeral.\u0027\n \u0027Lunatic!\u0027 Zharov put his foot down hard, skidded dangerously close to the rearmost caravan and began to overtake the column. \u0027Did you even look to see if they might be up to something? No, of course not! I tell you they have a British spy with them called Harry Keogh. He\u0027s a wanted man in both the USSR and Romania. Well, and now he\u0027s in your country and therefore under your jurisdiction. This could well be a feather in your cap - but only if you follow my instructions to the letter.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I see that,\u0027 the other mumbled, though in fact he saw very little.\n \u0027Do you have a weapon?\u0027\n \u0027What? Up here? What would I shoot, squirrels?\u0027\n Zharov growled and stamped on his brakes, skidding the car sideways in front of the first horse-drawn caravan. The column at once slowed and began to concertina, and as the dust settled Zharov and the blustering border policeman got out of the car.\n The KGB man pointed at the covered caravans, where scowling Gypsies were even now climbing down onto the road. \u0027Search them,\u0027 he ordered.\n \u0027But what\u0027s to search?\u0027 said the other, still mystified. \u0027They\u0027re caravans. A seat at the front, a door at the back, one room in between. A glance will suffice.\u0027\n \u0027Any space which would conceal a man, that\u0027s what you search!\u0027 Zharov snapped.\n \u0027But... what does he look like?\u0027 the other threw up his hands.\n \u0027Fool!\u0027 Zharov shouted. \u0027Ask what he doesn\u0027t look like! He doesn\u0027t look like a fucking Gypsy!\u0027\n The mood of the Travellers was ugly and getting worse as the Russian and his Securitatea aide moved down the line of caravans, yanking open their doors and looking inside. As they approached the last in line, the funeral vehicle, so a group of the Szgany put themselves in their way.\n Zharov snatched out his automatic and waved it at them. \u0027Out of the way. If you interfere I won\u0027t hesitate to use this. This is a matter of security, and grave consequences may ensue. Now open this door.\u0027\n The Gypsy who had spoken to Harry Keogh stepped forward. \u0027This was our king. We go to bury him. You may not go into this caravan.\u0027\n Zharov stuck the gun up under his jaw. \u0027Open up now,\u0027 he snarled, \u0027or they\u0027ll be burying two of you!\u0027\n The door was opened; Zharov saw two coffins lying side by side on low trestles where they had been secured to the floor; he climbed the steps and went in. The border policeman and Gypsy spokesman went with him. He pointed to the left-hand coffin, said: \u0027That one... open it.\u0027\n \u0027You are cursed!\u0027 said the Gypsy. \u0027For all your days, which won\u0027t be many, you are cursed.\u0027\n The coffins were of flimsy construction, little more than thin boards, built by the Travellers themselves. Zharov gave his gun to the mortified border policeman, who fully expected the next curse to be directed at him, and took out his bone-handled knife. At the press of a switch eight inches of steel rod with a needle point slid into view. Without pause Zharov raised his arm and drove the tool down and through the timber lid, so that it disappeared to the hilt into the space which would be occupied by the face of whoever lay within.\n Inside the coffin, muffled, someone gasped: \u0027Huh - huh - huh!\u0027 And there came a bumping and a scrabbling at the lid.\n The Gypsy\u0027s dark eyes bugged; he crossed himself, stepped back on wobbly legs; likewise the border policeman. But Zharov hadn\u0027t noticed. Nor had he noticed the high smell, which wasn\u0027t merely garlic. Grinning savagely, he yanked his weapon free and jammed its point under the edge of the lid, wrenching here and there until it was loose. Then he put the bone handle between his teeth, took the lid in both hands and yanked it half-open.\n And from within, someone pushed it the rest of the way... but it wasn\u0027t Harry Keogh!\n Then-\n - Even as the Russian\u0027s eyes stood out in his pallid face, so Vasile Zirra coughed and grunted in his coffin, and reached up a leathery arm to grasp Zharov and lever himself upright!\n \u0027God!\u0027 the KGB man choked then. \u0027G - G �C God!\u0027 His knife fell from his slack jaws into the coffin. The old dead Gypsy king took it up at once and drove it into Zharov\u0027s bulging left eye - all the way in, until it scraped the inside of his skull at the back. That was enough, more than enough.\n Zharov blew froth from his jaws and stepped woodenly back until he met the side of the caravan, then toppled over sideways. Falling, he made a rattling sound in his throat, and, striking the floor, twitched a little. And then he was still.\n But nothing else was still.\n At the front of the column a Gypsy drove Zharov\u0027s car into the ditch at the side of the road. The Securitatea lout was reeling back in the direction of his border post, shouting: \u0027It had nothing to do with me - nothing -nothing!\u0027 The Szgany spokesman stepped over Zharov\u0027s body, looked fearfully at his old king lying stiff and dead again in his coffin, crossed himself a second time and manhandled the cover back into place. Then someone shouted, \u0027Giddup!\u0027 and the column was off again at the trot.\n Half a mile down the road, where the roadside ditch was deep and grown with brambles and nettles, Nikolai Zharov\u0027s corpse was disposed of. It bounced from caravan to road to ditch, and flopped from view into the greenery...\n Even as Harry had drained the soup in the bowl to its last drop, drug and all, so he\u0027d brought Wellesley\u0027s talent into play and closed his mind off from outside interference. The Gypsy potion had been quick-acting; he hadn\u0027t even remembered being bundled into the funeral caravan and \u0027lain to rest\u0027 in the second coffin.\n But his mental isolation had disadvantages, too. For one, the dead could no longer communicate with him. He had of course taken this into account, weighing it against what Vasile Zirra had told him about the short-term effect of the Gypsy drug. And he\u0027d been sure he could spare an hour or two at least. What the old king hadn\u0027t told him was that only a spoonful or two of drugged soup would suffice. In draining the bowl dry, the Necroscope had dosed himself far too liberally.\n Now, slowly coming awake - half-way between the subconscious and conscious worlds - he collapsed Wellesley\u0027s mind-shield and allowed himself to drift amidst murmuring deadspeak background static. Vasile Zirra, lying only inches away from him, was the first to recognize Harry\u0027s resurgence.\n Harry Keogh? the dead old man\u0027s voice was tinged with sadness and not a little frustration. You are a brash young man. The spider sits waiting to entrap you, and you have to throw yourself into his web! Because you were kind to me - and because the dead love you - I jeopardized my own position to warn you off, and you ignored me. So now you pay the penalty.\n At the mention of penalties, Harry began to come faster awake. Even though he hadn\u0027t yet opened his eyes, still he could feel the jolting of the caravan and so knew that he was en route. But how far into his journey?\n You drank all of the soup, Vasile reminded him. Halmagiu is... very close! I know this land well; I sense it; the hour approaches midnight, and the mountains loom even now.\n Harry panicked a little then and woke up with something of a shock - and panicked even more when he discovered himself inside a box which by its shape could only be a coffin! Vasile Zirra calmed him at once:\n That must be how they brought you across the border. No, it isn\u0027t your grave but merely your refuge - for now. Then he told Harry about Zharov.\n Harry answered aloud, whispering in the confines of the fragile box: \u0027You protected me?\u0027\n You have the power, Harry, the other shrugged. So it was partly that, for you, and it was... partly for him.\n \u0027For him?\u0027 But Harry knew well enough who he meant. \u0027For Janos Ferenczy?\u0027\n When you allowed yourself to be drugged, you placed yourself in his power, in the hands of his people. The Zirras are his people, my son.\n Harry\u0027s answer was bitter, delivered in a tone he rarely if ever used with the dead: \u0027Then the Zirras are cowards! In the beginning, long before your time - indeed more than seven long centuries ago - Janos fooled the Zirras. He beguiled them, fascinated them, won them over by use of hypnosis and other powers come down to him from his evil father. He made them love him, but only so that he could use them. Before Janos, the true Wamphyri were always loyal to their Gypsy retainers, and in their turn earned the respect of the Szgany forever. There was a bond between them. But what has Janos given you? Nothing but terror and death. And even dead, still you are afraid of him.\u0027\n Especially dead! came the answer. Don\u0027t you know what he could do to me? He is the phoenix, risen from hell\u0027s flames. Aye, and he could raise me up, too, if he wished it, even from my salts! These old bones, this old flesh, has suffered enough. Many brave sons of the Zirras have gone up into those mountains to appease the Great Boyar; even my own son, Dumitru, gone from us these long years. Cowards? What could we do, who are merely men, against the might of the Wamphyri?\n Harry snorted. \u0027He isn\u0027t Wamphyri! Oh, he desires to be, but there\u0027s that of the true vampire essence which escapes him still. What could you do against him? If you had had the heart, you and a band of your men could have gone up to his castle in the mountains, sought him out in his place and ended it there and then. You could have done it ten, twenty, even hundreds of years ago! Even as I must do it now.\u0027\n Not Wamphyri? the other was astonished. But... he is!\n \u0027Wrong! He has his own form of necromancy, true -and certainly it\u0027s as cruel a thing as anything the Wamphyri ever used - but it is not the true art. He is a shape-changer, within limits. But can he form himself into an aerofoil and fly? No, he uses an aeroplane. He is a deceiver, a powerful, dangerous, clever vampire - but he is not Wamphyri.\u0027\n He is what he is, said Vasile, but more thoughtfully now. And whatever he is, he was too strong for me and mine.\n Harry snorted again. \u0027Then leave me be. I\u0027ll need to find help elsewhere.\u0027\n Smarting from Harry\u0027s scorn, the old Gypsy king said: Anyway, what do you know of the Wamphyri? What does anyone know of them?\n But Harry ignored him, shut him out, and sent forward his deadspeak thoughts into Halmagiu, to the graveyard there. And from there, even up to the ruined old castle in the heights...\n Black Romanian bats in their dozens flitted overhead, occasionally coming into the gleam of swaying, jolting lamplight where they escorted the jingling column of caravans through the rising, misted Transylvanian countryside. And the same bats flew over the crumbling walls and ruins of Castle Ferenczy.\n Janos was there, a dark silhouette on a bluff overlooking the valley. Like a great bat himself, he sniffed the night and observed with some satisfaction the mist lying like milk in the valleys. The mist was his, as were the bats, as were the Szgany Zirra. And in his way, Janos had communicated with all three. \u0027My people have him,\u0027 he said, as if to remind himself. It was a phrase he\u0027d repeated often enough through the afternoon and into the night. He turned to his vampire thralls, Sandra and Ken Layard, and said it yet again: \u0027They have the Necroscope and will bring him to me. He is asleep, drugged, which is doubtless why you can\u0027t know his whereabouts or read his mind. For your powers are puny things with severe limitations.\u0027\n But even as Janos spoke so his locator gave a sudden start. \u0027Ah!\u0027 Layard gasped. And: There... there he is!\u0027\n Janos grasped his arm, said: \u0027Where is he?\u0027\n Layard\u0027s eyes were closed; he was concentrating; his head turned slowly through an angle directed out over the valley to one which encompassed the mountain\u0027s flank, and finally the mist-concealed village. \u0027Close,\u0027 he said. \u0027Down there. Close to Halmagiu.\u0027\n Janos\u0027s eyes lit like lamps with their wicks suddenly turned high. He looked at Sandra. \u0027Well?\u0027\n She locked on to Layard\u0027s extrasensory current, followed his scan. And: \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said, slowly nodding. \u0027He is there.\u0027\n \u0027And his thoughts?\u0027 Janos was eager. \u0027What is the Necroscope thinking? Is it as I suspected? Is he afraid? Ah, he is talented, this one, but what use esoteric talents against muscle which is utterly ruthless? He speaks to the dead, yes, but my Szgany are very much alive!\u0027 And to himself he thought: Aye, he speaks to the dead. Even to my father, who from time to time lodges in his mind! Which means that just as I know the Necroscope, likewise the dog knows me! I cannot relax. This will not be over... until it is over. Perhaps I should have them kill him now, and resurrect him at my leisure. But where would be the glory, the satisfaction, in that? That is not the way, not if I would be Wamphyri! I must be the one to kill him, and then have him up to acknowledge me as his master!\n Sandra clung to Layard\u0027s arm and locked on to Harry\u0027s deadspeak signals... and in the next moment snatched herself back from the locator so as to collide with Janos himself. He grabbed her, steadied her. \u0027Well?\u0027\n \u0027He ... he speaks with the dead!\u0027\n \u0027Which dead? Where?\u0027 His wolf\u0027s jaws gaped expectantly.\n \u0027In the cemetery in Halmagiu,\u0027 she gasped. \u0027And in your castle!\u0027\n \u0027Halmagiu?\u0027 The ridges in his convoluted bat\u0027s snout quivered. \u0027The villagers have feared me for centuries, even when I was dust in a jar. No satisfaction for him there. And the dead in my castle? They are mainly Zirras.\u0027 He laughed hideously, and perhaps a little nervously. \u0027They gave their lives up to me; they will not hearken to him in death; he wastes his time!\u0027\n Sandra, for all her vampire strength, was still shaken. \u0027He ... he talked to a great many, and they were not Gypsies. They were warriors in their day, almost to a man. I sensed the merest murmur of their dead minds, but each and every one, they burned with their hatred for you!\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 For a moment Janos stood frozen - and in the next bayed a laugh which was more a howl. \u0027My Thracians? My Greeks, Persians, Scythians? They are dust, the veriest salts of men! Only the guards which I raised up from them have form. Oh, I grant you, the Necroscope may call up corpses to walk again - but even he cannot build flesh and bone from a handful of dust. And even if he could, why, I would simply put them down again! I have him; he is desperate and seeks to enlist impossible allies; let him talk to them.\u0027\n He laughed again, briefly, and turning towards the dark, irregular pile of his ruined castle, narrowed his scarlet eyes. \u0027Come,\u0027 he grunted then. \u0027There are certain preparations to be made.\u0027\n A handful of Szgany menfolk bundled Harry through the woods and past the outcropping knoll with its cairn of soulstones beneath the cliff. His hands were bound behind him and he stumbled frequently; his head ached miserably, as from some massive hangover; but as the group passed close to the base of the knoll, so he sensed the wispy wraiths of once-men all around.\n Harry let his deadspeak touch them, and knew at once that they were only the echoes of the Zirras he had spoken to in the Place of Many Bones deep in the ruins of the Castle Ferenczy. The knoll\u0027s base was lapped by a clinging ground mist, but its domed crest stood clear where the cairn of carved stones pointed at the rising moon. Men had carved those stones, their own headstones, before climbing to the heights and sacrificing themselves to a monster.\n \u0027Men?\u0027 Harry whispered to himself. \u0027Sheep, they were. Like sheep to the slaughter!\u0027\n His deadspeak was heard, as he had intended it should be, and from the castle in the heights was answered:\n Not all of us, Harry Keogh. I for one would have fought him, but he was in my brain and squeezed it like a plum. You may believe me when I say I did not go to the Ferenczy willingly. We were not such cowards as you think. Now tell me, did you ever see a compass point south? Just so easily might a Zirra, chosen by his master, turn away.\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 Harry inquired.\n Dumitru, son of Vasile.\n \u0027Well, at least you argue more persuasively than your father!\u0027 said Harry.\n One of the Gypsies prodded him where they bundled him unceremoniously up the first leg of the climb. \u0027What are you mumbling about? Are you saying your prayers? Too late for that, if the Ferenczy has called you.\u0027\n Harry, said Dumitru Zirra, if I could help you I would, in however small a measure. But I may not. Here in the Place of Many Bones, I was gnawed upon by one of the Grey Ones who serve the Boyar Janos. He had my legs off at the knees! I could crawl if you called me up, but I could never fight. What, me, a half-man of bone and leather and bits of gristle? But only say it and III do what I can.\n So, I\u0027ve found a man at last, Harry answered, this time silently, in the unique manner of the Necroscope. But lie still, Dumitru Zirra, for I need more than old bones to go against Janos.\n The way was harder now and the Gypsies sliced through the thongs binding Harry\u0027s wrists. Instead they put two nooses round his neck, one held by a man who stayed well ahead of him, and the other by a man to his rear. \u0027Only fall now, Englishman, and you hang yourself,\u0027 their spokesman told him. \u0027Or at very least stretch your neck a bit as we haul you up!\u0027 But Harry didn\u0027t intend to fall.\n He called out to M\u0026ouml;bius with his deadspeak: August? How\u0027s it coming?\n We\u0027re almost there, Harry! came the excited answer from a Leipzig graveyard. It could be an hour, two, three at the outside.\n Try thirty minutes, said Harry. I may not have much more than that left.\n Other voices crowded Harry\u0027s Necroscope mind. From the graveyard in Halmagiu:\n Harry Keogh ... we are shunned. Who named you a friend of the dead was a great liar!\n Taken off guard, he answered aloud. \u0027I asked for your help. You refused me. It\u0027s not my fault the world\u0027s teeming dead hold you in contempt!\u0027\n The Szgany where they laboured up the mountainside in the streaming moonlight looked at each other. \u0027Is he mad? Always he talks to himself!\u0027\n Harry opened all the channels of his mind - removed all barriers within and without - and at once Faethor was raging at him: Idiot! I am the only one who can help you, and yet you keep me hooded like some vicious bird in a cage. Why do you do this, Harry?\n Because I don\u0027t trust you, he answered silently. Your motives, your methods, you your black-hearted self! I don\u0027t trust a single thing you say or do, Faethor. You\u0027re not only a father of vampires but a father of liars, too. Still, you do have a choice.\n A choice? What choice?\n Get out of my mind and go back to your place in Ploiesti.\n Not until this thing is seen through -to- the - end! And how can I be sure you\u0027ll stick to that? You can\u0027t, Necroscope!\n Then sit in the dark, said Harry, closing him off again. And now the climb was half-way done...\n In Rhodes it was 1:30 a.m.\n Darcy Clarke and his team sat around a table in one of their hotel rooms. They had spent time recovering from their work, had eaten out as a group, had discussed their experiences and how they\u0027d been affected and probably would be affected for a long time to come. But in the back of their minds each and every one of them had known that their own part in the fight was minimal, and that without Harry Keogh\u0027s success everything else was cosmetic and the partial elation they felt now only the lull before the real storm.\n As they\u0027d returned from their late meal, so Zek had come up with an idea. She was a telepath and David Chung a locator. Together, they might be able to reach Harry and see what were his circumstances.\n Darcy had at once protested: \u0027But that\u0027s just what Harry didn\u0027t want! Look, if Janos got his mental hooks into you -\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve a feeling he\u0027ll be too much involved with Harry to be thinking about anything else,\u0027 Zek had cut in. \u0027Anyway, I want to do it. In the Lady Karen\u0027s stack - her aerie on Starside -1 had the job of reading the minds of a great many Wamphyri. Not one of them so much as suspected I was there, or if they did nothing came of it. That\u0027s the way I\u0027ll play it now.\u0027\n Still Darcy wasn\u0027t sure. \u0027I was only thinking about poor Trevor,\u0027 he said, \u0027and about Sandra...\u0027\n \u0027Trevor Jordan wasn\u0027t expecting trouble,\u0027 Zek had answered, \u0027and Sandra was inexperienced and her talent variable. I\u0027m not putting her down, just stating a fact.\u0027\n \u0027But -\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 and again she had cut him off. \u0027If David is willing, I want to do it. Harry means a lot to Jazz and me.\u0027\n At which Darcy had appealed to Jazz Simmons.\n Jazz had shaken his head. \u0027If she says she\u0027ll do it, then she\u0027ll do it,\u0027 he said. \u0027Hey, don\u0027t take my word for it! I\u0027m only married to her!\u0027\n And with reservations, finally Darcy had submitted. For the fact was that he as much as anyone else was interested to know Harry\u0027s circumstances.\n Now the three who weren\u0027t participants, Darcy, Jazz and Ben Trask, sat around the table and concentrated on what Zek and David were doing: the latter with his eyes closed, breathing deeply, his hands resting lightly on the stock and body of Harry\u0027s crossbow where it sat on the table, and Zek similarly disposed, her hand on one of his.\n They had been this way for a minute or two, waiting for Chung to locate the Necroscope through the medium of one of his own possessions. But as seconds ticked by in silence and the two participants grew even more still, so the watchers began to relax a little - even to fidget - and their thoughts to drift. And just at the moment that Jazz Simmons chose to scratch his nose, that was when contact was made.\n It was brief:\n David Chung uttered a long drawn-out sigh - and Zek snapped bolt upright in her chair. Her eyes remained closed for several long seconds while all the colour drained from her face. Then... they shot open and she snatched herself away from Chung, straightened to her feet and backed unsteadily away from the table.\n Jazz went to her at once. \u0027Zek?\u0027 his voice was anxious. \u0027Are you OK?\u0027\n For a moment she stared right through him, then at him, and accepted his arms. He felt her trembling, but at last she answered: \u0027Yes, I\u0027m all right. But Harry -\u0027\n \u0027You found him?\u0027 Darcy too had risen to his feet.\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 David Chung nodded. \u0027We found him. What did you read, Zek?\u0027\n She looked at him, looked at all of them, and freed herself from Jazz\u0027s arms. And said nothing.\n Darcy said, \u0027Is he OK?\u0027 And he held his breath waiting for her answer.\n Eventually she said, \u0027He\u0027s all right, yes, and he got there safely - to his destination, I mean. Also, I saw enough to know that it will all come to a head soon. But... something isn\u0027t right.\u0027\n Darcy\u0027s heart thudded in his chest. \u0027Not right? You mean he\u0027s already in trouble?\u0027\n She looked at him, and her look was so strange it was as if she gazed on alien things, in a world of ice beyond the times and places we know. \u0027In trouble? Oh, he\u0027s that, all right, but not necessarily the trouble you\u0027re thinking of.\u0027\n \u0027Can you explain?\u0027\n She straightened up and gave herself a shake, and hugged her elbows. \u0027No, I can\u0027t,\u0027 she said, shaking her head. \u0027Not yet. And anyway, I could be mistaken.\u0027\n \u0027But mistaken about what?\u0027 Darcy\u0027s frustration was mounting. \u0027Harry is going up against Janos Ferenczy personally, man to ... to thingl If he\u0027s in trouble before they even meet, his disadvantage could well be insurmountable!\u0027\n Again she gave him that strange look, and shook her head, and quietly said, \u0027No, not insurmountable. In fact on a one to one basis, I think you\u0027ll find that... that there\u0027s not a great deal to choose between them.\u0027\n Following which, and for quite a long time, she would say no more.\n With the misted valley far below and in the streaming moonlight of the heights, Harry knew the climb would soon be over and he\u0027d be face to face with hell. He had hoped to call up all the local dead into an army on his side, arid march with them on Janos\u0027s place. But even the dead were afraid. Now there was very little time left, and probably less hope. So the fact that he actually found himself anticipating what was to come was a very hard thing to explain. It could be of course that he\u0027d simply \u0027cracked\u0027 under the strain, but he didn\u0027t think so. He\u0027d never been the type.\n His mind was still open and M\u0026ouml;bius picked up his thoughts:\n A breakdown? You? No, never! And especially not now, when we\u0027re so close. I need to be into your mind, Harry.\n \u0027Enter, of your own free will,\u0027 he answered, almost automatically.\n The other was very quickly in and out, and he was excited as never before. It all fits! It all fits! he said. And the next time I come, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll be able to unlock those doors.\n \u0027But not right now?\u0027\n I\u0027m afraid not.\n \u0027Then there may not be time for a next time.\u0027\n Don\u0027t give in, Harry!\n \u0027I haven\u0027t. I\u0027m just facing facts.\u0027\n I swear we\u0027ll have the answer in minutes! And meanwhile you could try helping yourself.\n \u0027Help myself? How?\u0027\n Give yourself a problem in numbers. Set yourself a mathematical task. Prepare to re-establish your numeracy.\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t even know what a mathematical problem looked like.\u0027\n Then I\u0027ll set one for you. The great mathematician was silent for a moment, then said: Now listen. Stage one: I am nothing. Stage two: I am born and in the first second of my existence expand uniformly to a circumference of approximately 1,170,000 miles. Stage three: after my second second of uniform expansion my circumference is twice as great! Question: what am I?\n \u0027You\u0027re crazy,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027that\u0027s what you are! A minute ago I would have sworn it was me, but now I know that I\u0027m perfectly sane. Compared to you, anyway.\u0027\n Harry?\n Harry laughed out loud, causing the Gypsies who struggled up the final rise with him to jump. \u0027A madman,\u0027 they muttered, \u0027yes. The Ferenczy has driven him mad!\u0027\n The Necroscope used his deadspeak again: August, here\u0027s me who can\u0027t count his toes without getting nine, and you ask me to solve the riddles of the universe?\n Pretty close, Harry, M\u0026ouml;bius answered, pretty close. Just keep at it and I\u0027ll be back as soon as possible. His deadspeak faded and he was gone.\n Jesus! said Harry to himself, shaking his head in disgust. Jesus!\n But M\u0026ouml;bius\u0027s question had stuck in his head. He couldn\u0027t give it his attention right now, but he knew it was in there, lodged firmly in his mind.\n And now the party had reached the top of the cliffs; and somewhere here on this wind-blasted, sparsely-clad plateau, here lay the ruins of the Castle Ferenczy. That was where Janos waited; but right here and now, here at the top of the long climb... here something else waited. Seven somethings in all, or eight if one included the Grey One slinking in the moon-cast shadows. Harry\u0027s \u0027escort\u0027 to the lair of the undead vampire.\n The two leading Zirras saw them first, then Harry, finally the three Gypsies who panted where they laboured close behind. All drew back, startled and gasping, except the Necroscope himself. For Harry knew that he stood in the presence of dead men, which was common ground for him. What he and the others with him saw was this:\n Seven great Thracians, dead for more than two thousand years, raised up again from their burial urns to do Janos\u0027s bidding. They had the aspect of life at least, but there was a great deal of death in them, too. They wore helmets and some pieces of armour of their own period, but wherever their grey flesh showed naked it was scarred, disfigured. Their helmets were fearsome things, designed to terrify any beholder: they were domed, of gleaming bronze, with oval eye-holes dark in the flicker of their torches, and curved, downward-sweeping flanges to cover the jaws of the wearers.\n All seven were big men, but their leader stood a good four inches taller than the rest. He stepped forward, massive, but the eyes behind the holes in his mask were red - with sorrow.\n Bodrogk looked at Harry Keogh and the five who cowered behind him. \u0027Free him,\u0027 he said. His tongue was ancient but his meaning - the way his bronze sword touched Harry\u0027s ropes - couldn\u0027t be mistaken.\n The Szgany spokesman stepped cautiously to Harry\u0027s side and loosened the nooses a little around his neck. And to Bodrogk the Gypsy said: \u0027You are ... the Ferenczy\u0027s creatures?\u0027\n Bodrogk didn\u0027t understand. He looked this way and that, frowning, wondering what the man\u0027s question had been. Harry read his deadspeak confusion and answered: \u0027He wants to know if Janos sent you.\u0027 He spoke the words aloud, letting his deadspeak do the translating. And now Bodrogk\u0027s gaze centred on Harry alone.\n The massive Thracian paced forward and the Gypsies fell back. Bodrogk caught the ropes around Harry\u0027s neck and snapped them like threads. He grunted an introduction, then said: \u0027And so you are the Necroscope, beloved of all the world\u0027s dead.\u0027\n \u0027Not all of them,\u0027 Harry shook his head, \u0027for there are cowards among the dead even as there are among the living. If I can\u0027t know them - because they are afraid to know me - then I can\u0027t befriend them. And anyway, Bodrogk, I\u0027ve no great desire to be loved by thralls.\u0027\n Bodrogk\u0027s men had come forward, moving closer to the Gypsies on the bluff, herding them there. Now their huge leader took off his helmet and tossed it clanking aside. His neck was a bull\u0027s, his face full-bearded, fierce. But it was grey, that face, and, like the rest of his flesh, gaunt with an unspoken horror. His haggard, harried aspect told far better than any words the way in which Janos had dealt with him and his.\n \u0027I heard you talking to the dead,\u0027 said Bodrogk. \u0027You must know that all of Janos\u0027s thralls are not cowards.\u0027\n \u0027I know that the Thracians in the vaults of his castle are dust, and so can\u0027t help me. They told me they would but can\u0027t, because only Janos himself may call them up, for he alone has the words. On the other hand... you and your six are not dust.\u0027\n \u0027Are you calling us cowards?\u0027 Bodrogk\u0027s calloused hand fell upon Harry\u0027s shoulder close to his neck, and in his other hand a great bronze sword was lifted up a little.\n \u0027I only know that where some suffer Janos to live,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027I came to kill him and remove his taint forever.\u0027\n \u0027And are you a warrior, Harry?\u0027\n Harry lifted his head, gritted his teeth. He had never feared the dead, and would not now. \u0027Yes.\u0027\n Bodrogk smiled a strange, sad smile - which faded at once as he glanced beyond Harry. \u0027And these others with you? They captured you and brought you here, eh? A lamb to the sacrifice.\u0027\n \u0027They belong to the Ferenczy,\u0027 Harry nodded.\n The other looked at him and his eyes went into Harry\u0027s soul. \u0027A warrior without a sword, eh? Here, take mine,\u0027 He placed it in Harry\u0027s hands - then scowled at the Szgany and nodded to his men. The six Thracian lieutenants fell on the Gypsies with their swords, swept them from the bluff and over the edge of the cliff like chaff. It was so swift and sudden, they didn\u0027t even have time to scream. Their bodies went bumping, bouncing and clattering into the deep dark gorge.\n \u0027A friend at last,\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027I thought I might find a few, at least.\u0027\n \u0027It was you or them,\u0027 Bodrogk answered. \u0027To murder a worthy man, or slaughter a handful of dogs. Thralldom to the Ferenczy, or freedom - for as long as it may last. Not much of a choice. I made the only decision a man could make. But if I had paused a moment to think... then it might have gone the other way. For my wife\u0027s sake.\u0027 He explained his meaning.\n \u0027You\u0027ve taken an enormous chance,\u0027 Harry told him, giving back his sword.\n \u0027The dead called out to me,\u0027 Bodrogk answered. \u0027In their thousands they cried out, all of them begging your life. Aye, and one especially, whose tongue lashed like none other! Why, she might have been my own mother! But instead she was yours.\u0027\n Harry sighed, and thought: thank God for you, Ma!\n \u0027Your mother, yes,\u0027 said the other. \u0027She half-swayed me, and Sofia did the rest.\u0027\n \u0027Your wife?\u0027\n \u0027The same,\u0027 Bodrogk nodded, leading the way back towards the ruined castle in the heights. \u0027She said to me: \"Where is your honour now, you who once was mighty? Rather the applause and cold comforts of the teeming dead, and thralldom to Janos forever, than another urn filled with screaming ashes in the monster\u0027s vaults!\"\u0027\n Harry said, \u0027We have much in common then, your lady and I.\u0027 And, on impulse: ^Bodrogk, I already have my cause but she must be yours. Only fight with Sofia in mind, and you cannot lose,\u0027 And deep inside, unseen, unheard, he prayed it was true. Except: \u0027I have no plan,\u0027 he admitted.\n Bodrogk laughed, however grimly, and answered, \u0027A warrior without a sword, nor yet a plan of campaign!\u0027 But he grasped the Necroscope\u0027s shoulder and added: \u0027I have been dead a long time, Harry Keogh, but in my life I was a king of warriors, a general of armies. I was the Great Strategist of my race, and all the centuries flown between could not rob me of my cunning.\u0027\n Harry looked at the Thracian, striding gaunt, grim, dead and resurrected beside him. \u0027But will cunning suffice, when the vampire need only mutter a handful of words to return you to dust? I think you\u0027d better tell me how this magic of his works, and then something of your plan.\u0027\n \u0027The words of devolution may only be spoken by a Master, a Mage,\u0027 said Bodrogk. \u0027Janos is one such. He must direct his words, aim them like an arrow to their target. And to hit the target he must first see it. Wherefore ... we go up against him as individuals! You, me, my six, each man of us a unit in his own right. We approach and enter the castle from all sides. He cannot smite us all at once. And with mere words, even Words of Power, he can\u0027t smite you at all! Some of us shall fall, aye. What of it? We\u0027ve fallen before; we desire to fall, and to remain fallen! But while Janos deals with some of us, the others - especially you, Harry - may live long enough to deal with him.\u0027\n Harry nodded. \u0027It\u0027s as good a plan as any,\u0027 he said. \u0027But surely he isn\u0027t alone?\u0027\n \u0027He has his vampire thralls,\u0027 Bodrogk answered. \u0027Five of them. Three who were Szgany, and two but recently joined him. One of these is a woman with Powers -\u0027\n \u0027Sandra,\u0027 Harry breathed her name, felt sick in the knowledge of how it must be for her, and how it was yet to be.\n \u0027And the other a man likewise talented,\u0027 Bodrogk continued. \u0027Janos broke him to force his obedience. As for the woman: he did to her what he does to women, the dog!\u0027\n Then we have them to deal with, too.\u0027\n \u0027Indeed - and now!\u0027\n \u0027Now?\u0027\n They are waiting for us, there beneath the trees, beyond which lie those tumbled, cursed ruins. I am now supposed to give you into their hands, when they in turn will take you to their master.\u0027\n Harry looked, saw twisted, wind-blasted pines leaning towards the cliffs of the ultimate ridge. And in the shadows formed of their canopy, he also saw the yellow flames of vampire eyes, feral in the night. He reverted to true deadspeak, using only his mind to ask: Do you know how to deal with them?\n Do you? Question matched question.\n The stake, the sword, the fire, Harry answered, grimly.\n Swords we have, said Bodrogk. Fire too, in the torches which my men carry. And stakes? Aye... we cut a few while we waited for you at the cliff. For, you see, there were vampires in my day, too. So let\u0027s be at it.\n Janos\u0027s undead thralls came ghosting out of the trees. Their long arms reached for Harry; they smiled their ghastly smiles; not a one of them dreamed that Bodrogk had renegued. But even as they ringed the Necroscope about, so the Thracians fell on them and cut them down!\n It was butchery, and it was quick. All three vampires were beheaded, thrown to the ground and staked through their hearts. But only three? As Bodrogk\u0027s men took up the bodies of their victims and draped them across low branches, and set fire to the tinder-dry, resin-laden trees, Harry saw a crooked figure standing a little apart. And in the next moment Ken Layard stepped into view. \u0027Harry!\u0027 he sighed. \u0027Harry! Thank God!\u0027\n Moonlight turned his sallow flesh golden as he opened his arms wide, closed his eyes and turned his face up to the night sky. The Thracians looked at Harry; there was nothing he could do; he nodded and turned away -\n - And saw a tall, dark figure standing at the edge of the ruins, only a dozen paces away.\n Janos!\n Bodrogk\u0027s men had done with Layard now. They too saw the vampire there in the dark of the ruins, his scarlet eyes furiously ablaze. The Thracians began to melt quickly back into shadows, but not quickly enough for two of them who stood close together.\n Janos pointed at them, and his awful baying voice swelled out like a curse on the night air:\n \u0027OGTHROD AI\u0027F - GEB\u0027L EE\u0027H - YOG-SOTHOTH!\n There was more, but the effects of the rune of dissolution were already apparent. The two Thracians who were Janos\u0027s target had already cried out, fallen against each other, collapsed to insubstantial wraiths which, as he finished his devocation, drifted to the earth as dust!\n Harry glanced all about; Bodrogk and his remaining four were nowhere to be seen; another terror approached.\n The wolf - the Grey One which had also been part of his escort, but who had kept himself well back behind the party of Thracians - was now creeping up on him, shepherding him towards the castle\u0027s master. The Necroscope stooped, took up one of the bronze swords of the dematerialized Thracians, felt its great weight. Smaller than Bodrogk\u0027s sword, still it was no rapier. Harry knew he couldn\u0027t hope to wield this thing, but it was better than nothing.\n He looked for Janos, saw the monster\u0027s fleeting shadow moving back into the darkness of the ruins. A ploy, a feint: Harry\u0027s cue to pursue him. Well, and wasn\u0027t that what he was here for?\n As he followed after Janos, so the Grey One rushed up behind him and snapped at his heels. Harry stiffened his leg into a bar of flesh and bone and lashed out, and felt teeth crunch as his foot concertinaed the beast\u0027s slavering muzzle. He snarled at the creature and took up his sword two-handed... and astonishingly the wolf shrank back, whining!\n Before Harry could wonder at the meaning of this, Bodrogk and one of his remaining four stepped from cover and together fell on the animal. The sounds of their attack were brief and reminded Harry of nothing so much as a butcher\u0027s shop as they first crippled the beast, then cut short its yelping and howling by taking its head.\n Harry\u0027s eyes were more accustomed to the dark now; in fact his clarity of vision in the night was entirely remarkable and a wonder to him. But that was something else he had no time to consider. Instead he looked into the heart of the tumbled pile and saw Janos standing behind a toppled wall. The monster\u0027s gaze was fixed on a point beyond Harry - the Thracians, of course. But as he pointed his great talon of a hand, so the Necroscope shouted: \u0027Look out!\u0027\n \u0027OGTHROD AI\u0027F...\u0027 Janos commenced his crackling rune of devolution, and before he\u0027d finished another Thracian had cried out, sighed, and crumbled into smoking, drifting dust. One of the two had been saved at least, and Harry found himself hoping it was Bodrogk.\n But now the Necroscope went after Janos with a vengeance. Athletic, sure-footed even in the dark, he saw the vampire commence a descent apparently into the earth itself behind a mound of rubble. In the last moment before he disappeared he turned his freakish head and looked back, and Harry saw the crimson lamps of his eyes. There was a challenge written there which the Necroscope couldn\u0027t resist.\n He found the stone trapdoor raised above hollowed steps leading down, and almost without thought began his own descent - until a voice from behind stopped him. Looking back, he saw Bodrogk and his remaining warriors converging on him. \u0027Harry,\u0027 the great Thracian rumbled. \u0027You\u0027ll be first down. Go swiftly! Preserve my Sofia!\u0027\n He nodded, clambered down the spiralling stairwell - a wall of stone on one side and a chasm opening on the other - down to the first landing. But setting foot on the solid stone floor...\n Janos was waiting!\n The vampire came from nowhere, knocked the sword out of Harry\u0027s hands, hurled the Necroscope against the wall with such force that all the wind was hammered out of him. Before he could draw breath Janos towered over him, closed one huge hand over his face and slammed his head against the wall. Physically there was no match: Harry went out like a light.\n Harry... Haaarry! his mother cried out to him, a hundred mothers like her, an even larger number of friends and acquaintances, and all the dead in their graves across the world. Their voices soughed in the deadspeak aether, filled it, penetrated the threshold of Harry\u0027s subconscious mind and wrapped him in their warmth. Warmth, yes, for the minds of the dead are different from the common clay of their once-flesh.\n Ma? he answered through his pain and the struggle to rise up, back into the conscious world. Ma... I\u0027m hurt!\n I know, son, she said, her voice brimming over. I feel it... we all of us do. Lie still, Harry, and feel how we feel for you. Behind her, the wash of background deadspeak was building up to a crescendo, a wall of mental moaning.\n Lying still won\u0027t help, Ma, he said. Nor all the gnashing of teeth I hear going on there. I\u0027m going to have to shut you all out. I need to wake up. And when I\u0027ve done that I\u0027ll need help just to live.\n But the dead can help, Harry! she told him. There\u0027s one trying to contact you even now who has part of the answer.\n M\u0026ouml;bius? She had to be talking about M\u0026ouml;bius.\n No, not him, Harry sensed the shake of her head. Another, someone who is much closer to you. Except there\u0027s not much left of him, Harry. You won\u0027t hear him against all of this. Wait, and I\u0027ll see if I can quiet them.\n She retreated, spoke to others, passed on a message that spread outwards like ripples in a calm pond where a stone has been tossed, until it encompassed the world. The mental babble quickly faded away and an extraordinary silence followed. Out of which -- Harry?\n Whoever it was, his deadspeak was so weak that at first the Necroscope thought he must be imagining it. But:\n Are you looking for me? he answered, eventually. Who are you?\n I am nothing, the other sighed. Not even a whimper, not even a ghost. Or at very best a ghost even among ghosts. Why, even the dead have difficulty hearing my voice, Harry! My name was George Vulpe, and five years ago my friends and I discovered the Castle Ferenczy.\n Harry nodded. He killed you, right?\n He did more, worse, than that! the other moaned, his deadspeak thin as the slither of dry, dead leaves. He took my life, my body, and left me without... anything! Not even a place to rest.\n Harry felt that this was very important. Can you explain?\n I\u0027ve spoken to a great many Zirras in the Place of Many Bones, George Vulpe told him. When the Ferenczy lay in his urn, they were the ones who came to feed and refuel him with their blood. But I was different. On my hands there were only three fingers!\n Now Harry gasped. You were the one!\n He has my body, the other said again. And I can\u0027t rest. Ever.\n What was he? Harry wanted to know. I mean, how did he usurp you, drive you from your body?\n The other explained. My blood drew him up from his urn. I was a son of his sons, from the Zirra clan. But I didn\u0027t know that. Only my blood knew.\n He came from his urn? Harry pressed. As essential salts?\n My blood transformed him.\n Harry needed help to understand. He uncovered Faethor.\n Damn you, Harry Keogh! the incorporeal vampire at once raged.\n Be quiet! Harry told him. Explain what this man is saying to me.\n Faethor heard Vulpe\u0027s story, said: Why, isn\u0027t it obvious?\n Janos had taken precautions. When I reduced his brain and vampire both to ashes, his ever faithful Zirras hid him away in a secret place until he could perform this... this metempsychosis. But it wasn\u0027t merely a transfer of minds: Janos\u0027s leech was revived from its ashes. The creature itself entered this one\u0027s body! And now -\n But Harry at once closed him down again. And: George, he said, thanks for your help. I don\u0027t see what good it will do me, but thanks anyway.\n The only answer was a sigh, rapidly fading to nothing...\n Harry strove to rise up from unconsciousness, to revive himself, to wake up. And was on the verge of succeeding, then M\u0026ouml;bius came.\n Harry! M\u0026ouml;bius cried. We have it! We believe we have it! He entered the Necroscope\u0027s mind, and in another moment: Yes, yes - this must be right! But... are you ready?\n I\u0027ve never been so ready, Harry answered.\n That\u0027s not what I meant, said M\u0026ouml;bius. I mean, are you prepared mentally?\n Prepared mentally? August, what is this?\n The M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum, Harry. I can open those doors, but not if you\u0027re not ready for it. There\u0027s a different universe in there, doors opening on places undreamed. Harry, I wouldn\u0027t want you to get sucked into your own mind!\n Sucked into - ? Harry shook his head. I don\u0027t follow.\n Look... did you solve my problem?\n Problem? Suddenly Harry felt rage and frustration boiling up in him. Your fucking problem? What time do you think I\u0027ve had for solving fucking problems?\n Did you even think about it?\n No... Yes!... yes, I thought about it.\n And?\n Nothing.\n Harry, I\u0027m going to open one of those doors... now!\n The Necroscope felt nothing. Did it work?\n It worked, yes, M\u0026ouml;bius breathed. And if you have the equations, you should be able to do the rest yourself.\n But I don\u0027t feel any different.\n Did you ever? Before, I mean?\n No, but-\n I\u0027ll open another door. There!\n But this time Harry did feel it. A sharp white lance of agony, setting off fireworks in his head. It was something like the pain Harry Jnr had arranged for him if ever he should be tempted to use his deadspeak, but since he was already unconscious its effect was greatly reduced. And it served an entirely different purpose.\n Instead of blacking him out, it jabbed him awake -\n - He came awake, into a waking nightmare!\n Cold liquid burned his face, got into his throat and stung him, caused him to cough. It was - alcohol? Certainly it was volatile. It smoked, shimmering into vapour all around. And Harry was lying in it. He struggled to his hands and knees, tried not to breathe the fumes, which were rising up into some sort of flue directly overhead ... A blackened flue... Fire-blackened!\n Harry kneeled in a basin or depression cut from solid rock, kneeled there in this pool of volatile liquid. Impressions came very quickly. He must be in the very bowels of the castle, down in the bedrock itself ... a huge cave... and against the opposite wall where rough-hewn steps led up to the higher levels... there stood Janos watching him! He held a burning brand aloft, his scarlet eyes reflecting its fire.\n Their eyes met, locked, and Janos\u0027s lips drew back from his monstrous teeth in a hideous grin. \u0027And so you are awake, Necroscope,\u0027 he said. \u0027Good, for I desired that you should feel the fire which will make you mine forever!\u0027 He looked at the torch in his hand, then at the floor. Harry looked, too. At a shallow trough or channel where it had been cut in the rock. It ran from Janos\u0027s feet, across the floor, to the lip of the basin.\n Jesus! Harry lurched for the rim of the shallow pool, and his hands shot out from under him. He wallowed in the liquid, put one hand on the rim and drew himself up, heard Janos\u0027s mad laughter and saw him slowly lowering the brand to the floor!\n My problem, Harry! M\u0026ouml;bius was hysterical in his horror.\n Harry fought back terror to picture the thing, instinctively translating M\u0026ouml;bius\u0027s circumferences into diameters:\n And his intuitive mathematical talent, returned to him at last, did the rest.\n What am I? M\u0026ouml;bius howled, as the fire of Janos\u0027s torch descended to the liquid fuse.\n \u0027Light!\u0027 Harry cried aloud. \u0027What else can you be? Only light expands at twice the speed of light - from nothing to a diameter of 744,000 miles in two seconds!\u0027\n Fire whooshed, came racing across the floor of the cave in a blue-glaring blaze.\n Which light? M\u0026ouml;bius was frantic.\n \u0027You were nothing until you came into existence,\u0027 Harry yelled. \u0027Therefore... you are the Primal Light!\u0027\n Yes!!! M\u0026ouml;bius danced in Harry\u0027s mind. And my source was the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum! Welcome back, Harry!\n Computer screens opened in Harry\u0027s mind even as the bowl became an inferno. Searing heat roared up in a tongue of blue fire that belched into the chimney overhead. Liquid fire singed the hair from his head and face and set his clothes blazing. It lasted perhaps one tenth of a second - until Harry conjured a M\u0026ouml;bius door and toppled through it!\n He knew where to go, conjured a second door and fell out of the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum into a deep drift of snow at the roof of the world. He was scorched, yes, but alive. Alive as never before. Elation filled him, and more than elation. His laughter - hysterical as M\u0026ouml;bius\u0027s own -quickly died down, went out of him, became a growl that rumbled menacingly in his throat...\n Janos had seen him disappear, and in that moment had known that Harry Keogh was invincible. The Necroscope had gone... where? And he\u0027d be back... when? And what awesome Powers would he bring with him? Janos dared not wait to find out.\n He bounded up the stairs through the lower limits of the castle\u0027s labyrinth bowels, eventually emerging in the area of massively vaulted rooms which housed his urns and jars and lekythoi. And discovered Harry there ahead of him! Harry, Bodrogk and the remaining Thracians.\n Janos fell back to crouch against a wall, hissing, then straightened up to come forward again. \u0027You are dust!\u0027 he snarled at Bodrogk, and pointed his finger.\n The huge Thracian chief and two of his captains ducked through an arched door into another room, but the third was caught in the blast of Janos\u0027s devocation:\n \u0027OGTHROD AI\u0027F, GEB\u0027L - EE\u0027H,\n YOG-SOTHOTH, \u0027NGAH\u0027NG AI\u0027Y,\n ZHRO!\u0027\n The devolved man threw up his arms and sighed his last... and fell in a cloud of grey-green chemicals.\n Janos roared his mad laughter, leaped to take up the fallen warrior\u0027s sword. He advanced on Harry, sword raised high - and the Necroscope knew exactly what to do. For Harry was a mage, a master in his own right; and in his mind right now, crying out from all of their prisoning urns, a thousand deadspeak voices instructed him in the Words of Power!\n He pointed at the jars scattered all about, and turning in a circle uttered the rune of invocation:\n \u0027Y\u0027AI \u0027NG\u0027NGAH, YOG-SOTHOTH,\n H\u0027EE - L\u0027GEB, F\u0027AI THRODOG,\n UAAAH!\u0027\n The vaulted room filled with stench and purple smoke in a moment, obscuring Harry, Janos and all. And out of the rush and reek came the cries of the tortured. There had been no time for the mixing of chemicals; these resurrected Thracians, Persians, Scythians and Greeks would all be imperfect. But their lust for vengeance would be entirely in keeping.\n Janos knew it, too. He careened through their stumbling, groaning ranks as they shattered their jars and grew up like mushrooms out of nothing; but as fast as he could target a group and put them down again, so the Necroscope called them up! There was no way the vampire could win. He couldn\u0027t bellow his words fast enough, and the ranks of resurrected warriors were rapidly closing on him.\n Blasting a path of dust before him, he fled to the steps winding up to ruined regions above and passed from sight. The hideously incomplete army would follow after, but Harry cautioned them:\n \u0027Stay here. Your part is played. But this time when you go down, you know that you may rest in peace.\u0027 And they blessed him as he returned them all to their materia. All except the warrior king Bodrogk.\n And taking Bodrogk with him, he stepped through a M\u0026ouml;bius door... and out again into the ruins of Castle Ferenczy.\n They waited, and in a little while Janos came, grunting, whining and panting into the night. He saw them, choked on his terror, gagged and reeled as he stumbled away from them out of the ruins. He was spent; he had no breath; he tottered to the cliff behind the castle and climbed it along a path... and half-way up found Harry and Bodrogk waiting for him. The huge Thracian carried a battleaxe.\n There was nowhere left to run. Janos looked outwards to the night and his crimson eyes gazed on empty space. In all his life there\u0027d been only one Wamphyri art he never mastered or counterfeited, and now he must. He held up his arms and willed the change, and his clothing tore as his body wrenched itself into a great blanket, an aerofoil of flesh. And like a bat in the night, he launched himself from the cliffside path.\n He succeeded! - he flew! - with the tatters of his ripped clothing fluttering about him like strange wings. He flew... until Bodrogk\u0027s hurled battleaxe buried itself in his spine.\n Harry and Bodrogk returned to the ruins and found the monster writhing there where he\u0027d crashed down in the rubble. He choked and coughed up blood, but already he\u0027d worked the axe loose and his vampire flesh was healing him. The Necroscope kneeled beside him and looked him in the eye. Man to ... man? Face to terrifying, terrified face.\n \u0027Bastard Necroscope!\u0027 Janos\u0027s eyes bled where they bulged.\n \u0027You have a man\u0027s body,\u0027 Harry answered, without emotion, \u0027but your mind and the vampire within you were raised from ashes in an urn.\u0027 He pointed a steady hand and finger. \u0027Ashes to ashes, Janos, and dust to dust! OGTHROD AI\u0027F, GEB\u0027L - EE\u0027H.\u0027\n The vampire gave a shriek, wriggled frantically, choked, gagged and regained his man-shape.\n And the Necroscope continued: \u0027YOG-SOTHOTH, \u0027NGAH\u0027NGAI\u0027Y.\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 Janos howled. \u0027N-n-noooooooo!\u0027\n As Harry uttered the final word, \u0027Zhror, so Janos\u0027s entire body convulsed in instant, unbearable agony. He writhed frantically, vibrated, then grew still. Finally his head flopped back and his awful mouth flew open, and the lights went out in his eyes. Then -\n - His massive chest slowly deflated as he sighed his last, long sigh. No air escaped him but a cloud of red dust, drifting on the air. The rest of his body, even his head, must be full of the stuff. And as the dust of that devolved vampire leech settled, it reminded the Necroscope of nothing so much as the spores of those weird mushrooms at Faethor\u0027s place on the outskirts of Ploiesti.\n Which in turn served to remind him of something else as yet unfinished...\n Bodrogk\u0027s lady Sofia came up out of the ruins, and Sandra came with her.\n She came ghosting in the way of vampire thralls, her yellow eyes alive in the night, but Harry knew that she was less than Sandra now. Or more. Briefly, he remembered his precognitive glimpse back at the start of this whole thing: of an alien creature that came to him in the night and lusted after him, but only for his blood. Sandra was now an alien creature, who would lust after men for their blood.\n She flew into his arms and sobbed into his neck, and holding her tightly - as much to steady himself as to steady her - he looked over her sallow shoulder to where Bodrogk gathered up his wife. And he heard Sofia say:\n \u0027She saved me! The vampire girl found me where Janos had hidden me and set me free!\u0027\n And Harry wondered: her last free-will act, before the monstrous fever in her blood claims her for its own?\n Sandra\u0027s beautiful, near-naked body was cold as clay where it pressed against the Necroscope, and Harry knew there was no way he could ever warm it. A telepath, she \u0027heard\u0027 the thought as surely as if it had been spoken, and drew back a little. But not far enough.\n His thin sharp stake, a splinter of old oak, drove up under her breast and into her heart; she took one last breath, one staggering step away from him, and fell.\n Bodrogk, seeing Harry\u0027s anguish, did the rest... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iv-deadspeak-necroscope-4/page-16.html","bookId":2437,"book":{"id":2437,"title":"Necroscope IV: Deadspeak (Necroscope #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Several years after his return to earth Harry Sr. is trouble by nightmares of resurgent Vampires.
