{"id":78834,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"9\\n\\n Cat and Mouse\\n\\n \u0027I understand why you didn\u0027t trust me,\u0027 said Papastamos, \u0027but you should have. What? You think the Greeks are ignorant of these things? Greeks, of all people? Listen, I was a boy in Phaestos on the island of Crete, born and lived there until I was thirteen. Then I went to my sister in Athens. But I never forgot the myths of the islands, and I never forgot what I saw and heard there. Did you know that there are places in Greece even now where they put the silver coins on the eyes of the dead, to keep them closed? Hah! Those slits in the eyes of Layard. He kept opening his eyes!\u0027\\n\\n Darcy said to him: \u0027Manolis, how could we know? If you took a hundred people and told them you were hunting a vampire, how many do you think would believe you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here in Greece, in the Greek islands, ten or twenty,\u0027 the other answered. \u0027Not the young peoples, no, but the old ones who remember. And up in the mountains - in the mountain villages of Karpathos, for example, or Crete, or better still in Santorin - maybe seventy-five out of a hundred! Because the old ways die hard in such places. Don\u0027t you know where you are? Just look at a map. Six hundred miles away is Romania! And do you think the Romanian peoples don\u0027t know the Vrykoulakas, the vampire? No, no, we are not the innocent childrens, my friends!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027let\u0027s waste no more time. You know, you understand, you believe - we accept that. But still we warn you that myths and legends can be very different from the real thing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not so sure,\u0027 Manolis shook his head. \u0027And in any case I have had the experience of the real thing. When I was a boy thirty years ago there was a sickness. The children were growing weak. An old priest had lived on the island in a remote place in the stony hills. He had lived there, all alone, for many years. He said he was alone for his sins, and dared not surround himself with the people. Recently he had been found dead in his place and they had buried him there. But now the village priest went there with the people - with the fathers of the sick children - and dug him up. They found him fat and red and smiling! And how did they deal with him? I heard it later - with a wooden spear through the heart. I cannot be sure, no, but that night there was a big bonfire in the hills, and its light was seen for miles around.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think we should tell Manolis everything,\u0027 said Sandra.\\n\\n \u0027We will,\u0027 Harry nodded, \u0027but first he came here to tell us something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 Manolis gave a start and stood up. \u0027My God, but now this vampire you hunt - there are two of them!\u0027\\n\\n Harry groaned. \u0027Ken Layard!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course, the poor Ken. This morning, one hour ago, I get the call. It is the morgue. They have found the naked body of a mortician. He is dead with a broken neck. And Ken Layard\u0027s body has disappeared. And then - \u0027 he spoke directly to Harry,\u0027 - then I remember what you say about Layard being undead, and that you want him burned very quickly. And then I know. But this is not all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go on, Manolis,\u0027 Darcy prompted him.\\n\\n \u0027The Samothraki has been absent from the harbour since the night of the trouble under the old windmills, when I saved Layard from the sea. This morning the fishermen have brought in many pieces of burned wreckage. It is - it was - the Samothraki! And still there is more. A girl, a prostitute, died on the streets three, four nights ago. She has been examined. The doctor says it could have been anything: not eating - the, how do you say, malnutrition? - or perhaps she fainted and lay in the alley all night, and so died of the exposure. But most likely it is the anaemia. Hah! You know this anaemia? No blood in the body? My God - anaemia!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like a plague.\u0027 Harry groaned. \u0027She must be burned, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She will be,\u0027 Manolis promised. \u0027Today. Believe me, I will see to it!\u0027\\n\\n Sandra said: \u0027And still we\u0027re no closer to discovering who the vampire is, or what he\u0027s done to Ken. And I for one would like to know how those bats got in here...\u0027\\n\\n Harry indicated a domed wood-burning fireplace where its flue went up into a brick wall. \u0027At least there\u0027s no great mystery there,\u0027 he said. \u0027As to Layard: he\u0027s now in thrall to this thing and, depending how strong his will is, serving it faithfully. And the vampire\u0027s identity? Well, there\u0027s a clue I can follow up. I think I may know someone who has the answer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What clue?\u0027 Manolis faced him. \u0027Any clue - all clues -are for me. No more secrets. Also, I want to know about that word the bats made on the wall: what did it mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s the clue,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Faethor fixed it so that I couldn\u0027t mistake his meaning. He wants me to go and see him.\u0027\\n\\n Frowning, Manolis looked from face to face. \u0027This Faethor who fixes such things, and in such a way. He is... what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No more secrets?\u0027 said Harry, wrily. And: \u0027Manolis, even if we had an entire day to waste, still we couldn\u0027t tell you everything. And even you wouldn\u0027t believe it all if we did.\u0027\\n\\n Try me!\u0027 Manolis answered. \u0027But in the car. First you dress and I take you to breakfast, then to the police station in town. I think is the safest place. And meanwhile you tell me everything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very well, we will,\u0027 Darcy agreed. \u0027But we must be allowed to get on with this thing in our own way. And Manolis, we have to be sure that all of this will go no further than you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anything you say,\u0027 the other nodded. \u0027And anything I can help you with, I will. You are the experts. But please, we are wasting the time. Hurry now!\u0027\\n\\n They got dressed as quickly as they could...\\n\\n By mid-morning their plans were finalized, and by noon Manolis Papastamos had set them in action. Once he\u0027d known what was to be done, he wasted little time doing it.\\n\\n Harry Keogh was now the owner of a suitably worn and well-thumbed Greek passport, stamped with a visa for Romania. Ostensibly, its bearer was an \u0027international dealer in antiques\u0027 (a cover which had brought a wry smile to Harry\u0027s face), one \u0027Hari Kiokis\u0027, a name which shouldn\u0027t give him too much trouble. Sandra had been fixed up with a flight to Gatwick, London, leaving Rhodes at 9:10 that night, and Darcy would stay here and work with Manolis. E-Branch had been put as completely in the picture as possible, but for now Darcy hadn\u0027t called in any esper help. First he must ascertain the size of the problem, and after that he\u0027d call on help as required and available directly through Sandra.\\n\\n Harry\u0027s flight to Bucharest via Athens was at 2:30; with an hour to spare he and the others had lunch on the high balcony of a taverna overlooking Mandraki harbour. And it was there that one of the local policemen found them, with information for Papastamos.\\n\\n The man was fat and sweaty, scarred and bow-legged; if he hadn\u0027t been a policeman then he would\u0027ve had to be a brigand. He arrived in the road below their balcony on a tiny moped which his huge backside almost entirely obscured. \u0027Hey, Papastamos!\u0027 he shouted, waving a fat arm. \u0027Hey, Manolis!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on up,\u0027 Manolis called down to him. \u0027Have a beer. Cool down.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You won\u0027t feel so cool in a minute, Inspector!\u0027 the other called back, entering the taverna and panting his way upstairs.\\n\\n When he arrived Manolis offered him a chair, said: \u0027What is it?\u0027\\n\\n The other got his breath back, and in wheezing Greek told his story. \u0027Down at the mortuary, at the hospital,\u0027 he began. \u0027We were recording statements about the missing corpse - \u0027 He glanced at Manolis\u0027s company and quickly shrugged his apologies in the Greek fashion. \u0027I mean, about the circumstances in the case of your dead English friend. We took statements from everybody, like you said. There was this girl, a receptionist who was on duty the night you saved his life. She said in her statement that someone went to see him in the early hours of the morning. It was her description of this one that I found interesting. Here, read it yourself.\u0027\\n\\n He took a crumpled, sweat-stained official statement form from his shirt pocket and handed it over. Manolis quickly translated what he\u0027d been told, then read the statement. He read it a second time, more thoroughly, and his forehead creased into a frown. And: \u0027Listen to this,\u0027 he said, reading aloud.\\n\\n \u0027It must have been about six-thirty in the morning when this man came in. He said he was a Captain and one of his crew had gone missing. He\u0027d heard how someone had been rescued from the sea and wondered if it was his man. I took him to see Mr Layard in his room where he was sedated. The Captain said: \"Ah, no, this one is not mine. I have troubled you for nothing.\" I began to turn away but he didn\u0027t follow me.\\n\\n \u0027When I looked back he was standing with his hand on the bump on Layard\u0027s head, and he said: \"This poor man! Such an ugly wound! Still, I am glad he is not one of mine.\"\\n\\n \u0027I said he must not touch the patient and showed him out. It was strange: although he had said he was sorry for Layard, still he was smiling a very peculiar smile...\u0027\\n\\n Harry had slowly straightened up in his chair as he listened to this, and now he asked, \u0027And the description?\u0027\\n\\n Manolis read it out, and mused: \u0027A sea-Captain; very tall, slim, strange, and wearing dark glasses even in the dawn light. I think ... I think I know this one.\u0027\\n\\n The fat policeman nodded. \u0027I think so, too,\u0027 he said. \u0027And when we were watching that fleapit the Dakaris, we saw him come out of there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 Manolis thumped the table. \u0027The Dakaris? It\u0027s a spit away from where they found that poor whore!\u0027 And at once: \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Sandra.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who is he?\u0027 Harry demanded.\\n\\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Manolis looked at him. \u0027Who? Oh, I\u0027ll do even better than that and show you where. There he is!\u0027 And he pointed out across the harbour.\\n\\n The sleek white motor-cruiser was slicing her way out of the harbour through the deep-water channel, but the distance wasn\u0027t so great that Harry\u0027s keen eyes couldn\u0027t read her name. \u0027The Lazarus!\u0027 he breathed. \u0027And the name of the owner?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The same, almost,\u0027 said Manolis. \u0027Jianni Lazarides.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Jianni?\u0027 Harry\u0027s face was suddenly drawn, lined, grey.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny,\u0027 Manolis shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027John,\u0027 Harry echoed him. And in the back of his mind another voice - or the memory of one - said, Janos!\\n\\n \u0027Ahhhr Harry clasped his head as pain lanced through his skull. It was sharp but short, nothing so bad as a full-scale attack, a mere warning. But it confirmed his worst suspicions. For Janos could only be a name he\u0027d learned from the dead - perhaps from Faethor himself - with whom conversation had been forbidden. He unscrewed his eyes and let in the cruel sunlight and the concerned expressions of his friends. And: \u0027I know him,\u0027 he said, when he could speak. \u0027And now I know I\u0027m right to go and see Faethor.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But why, if we already know our man?\u0027 Darcy asked.\\n\\n \u0027Because we don\u0027t know him well enough,\u0027 Harry told him, as the pain quickly subsided. \u0027And since Faethor spawned him, he\u0027s the one most likely to know how to deal with him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing has changed,\u0027 said Harry as they drove into the airport in the car Manolis had provided. \u0027Everything stands. I go to Ploiesti, to see if I can learn anything from Faethor. I\u0027ll spend the entire night there, even sleep in the ruins of his place if I have to. It\u0027s the only sure way I can think of to contact him. Sandra goes back home tonight - definitely! Now that this \"Lazarides\", Janos Ferenczy, controls Ken Layard, he can locate anyone he wants to. Anyone associated with me will be in danger, and more especially so here in the vampire\u0027s own territory.\u0027 He paused and looked into each face in turn, then continued:\\n\\n \u0027Darcy, you stay here with Manolis, dig up everything you can on Lazarides, his crew, and the Lazarus. Go right back to the start of it, when they first appeared on the scene. Manolis can be of real assistance there; since Janos has chosen himself a Greek identity, it shouldn\u0027t be too hard for the Greek authorities to fill in his origins and background.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Manolis, looking at Harry in his driving mirror. \u0027One other thing. He has dual nationality, this one. Greek, yes - and Romanian!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, my God!\u0027 Sandra gasped at once. And: \u0027Harry, he can travel freely where you may only go with extreme caution!\u0027\\n\\n Harry pursed his lips, thought about it for a moment, and said: \u0027Well, and maybe I should have expected as much. But that doesn\u0027t change anything either. By the time he knows I\u0027m there, and if he tries to come after me, I\u0027ll be out again. Anyway, I\u0027ve no choice.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027God, I feel so helpless!\u0027 Manolis complained as he parked the car and they all climbed out. \u0027Inside, a voice says, \"arrest this monster aboard his ship!\" But I know that this is impossible. I understand we must not alert him until we know all about him. Also, Ken is in his hands, and-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Save it, about Ken,\u0027 Harry cut in, heading for the departure lounge. \u0027There\u0027s nothing anyone can do for him.\u0027 He turned his haunted eyes on Manolis. \u0027Except destroy him, which would be a mercy. And even then don\u0027t expect him to thank you for it. Thank you? God, no! He\u0027ll have your heart out first!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 Darcy told Manolis, \u0027you\u0027re absolutely right that we can\u0027t touch him yet. We\u0027ve told you about Yulian Bodescu; he was an innocent, a child, by comparison with Lazarides. Harry thinks so, anyway. But once he knew we were onto him ... we each of us lived in fear of hell until he was finally dead!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is all academic,\u0027 Manolis shrugged. \u0027What? I should go to the government and say, \"send our gunboats to sink a vampire in his ship!\" No, quite impossible. But when the Lazarus puts in to port again, I think I may be tempted to take out her crew one by one!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you could isolate them, positively identify them as vampires, and had a good back-up team who knew what to do and weren\u0027t frightened to do it, yes,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027But again this might be to tip Lazarides\u0027s hand, which in turn might precipitate something you couldn\u0027t even hope to control.\u0027\\n\\n Guiding Harry and the others to the passenger control desk, Manolis answered: \u0027Don\u0027t worry about it. I do nothing until I get your go-ahead. Is frustrating, that\u0027s all...\u0027\\n\\n Harry had only fifteen minutes to wait before being called forward. At the last minute, Sandra said, \u0027If we\u0027d thought of it, I could have gone on with you to Athens and flown home from there. But things have happened so quickly I ... I don\u0027t like seeing you go off like this, on your own, Harry.\u0027\\n\\n He held her very close and kissed her, then turned to Darcy and Manolis. \u0027Listen, I\u0027m coming back, I promise you. But if I should be delayed, go ahead and finish things as best you can. And good luck!\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s my middle name,\u0027 Darcy told him. \u0027Take care of yourself, Harry.\u0027\\n\\n Sandra hugged him again, and then he stood back, nodded, turned and followed the crowd out onto the dusty concourse, towards the landing strip.\\n\\n Among the many people there to see friends off, a man in flip-flops, bright Bermuda shorts and an open-necked white shirt watched Harry\u0027s plane take off. He was a Greek who ran the occasional errand for the Russians. Now all he had to do was discover Harry\u0027s destination and pass it on.\\n\\n Not too difficult. His brother worked at the passenger information desk.\\n\\n Harry made his Athens connection and landed in Bucharest at 5:45. The airport and its perimeter were thick with lightly armed soldiers in grey-green shirts, drab olive trousers and scuffed boots; but their presence seemed pointless and the men themselves aimless. This was a duty of long standing, out of which nothing had ever come. They didn\u0027t expect anything to come out of it and in all honesty weren\u0027t much interested. They were there because they\u0027d been told to be.\\n\\n As Harry passed through customs, the official stamping passports scarcely looked at him; all eyes were turned towards the three or four members of some foreign delegation or other, who were being given red-carpet treatment through the airport and out into the \u0027freedom\u0027 of Romania. Harry reckoned he was lucky.\\n\\n Manolis had fixed him up with one hundred and fifty American dollars, which he\u0027d sworn were good as gold. He caught a taxi, dumped his holdall on the back seat and told the driver: \u0027Ploiesti, please.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eh? Ploiesti?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You English?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Greek. But I don\u0027t speak your language.\u0027 And God, I hope you don\u0027t speak Greek!\\n\\n \u0027Hah! Is funny! We are both speaking English, yes?\u0027 The man was unkempt and his breath was bad, but he seemed amiable enough.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027it\u0027s funny. Er, do you take dollars? American?\u0027 He showed him some green.\\n\\n \u0027Eh? Eh? The dollars?\u0027 His eyes stood out. \u0027Sure, by gosh! I take it! Ploiesti is - I don\u0027t know - sixty kilometres? Is, er, ten dollars?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you asking?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is ten dollars,\u0027 he grinned, shrugged.\\n\\n \u0027Fine!\u0027 Harry handed over the money. \u0027Now I sleep,\u0027 he said, leaning back and closing his eyes. He didn\u0027t intend to sleep, but neither did he want to talk...\\n\\n The Romanian countryside was boring. Even in springtime merging with summer there wasn\u0027t anything much of green to be seen. Plenty of browns and greys: piles of sand and cement, cheap breeze-blocks and bricks. Enough building going on to rival all the coastal regions of Spain, Turkey and the Greek islands put together. Except that this had nothing to do with tourism, for there was plenty of wrecking, too. The grotesque, inhuman mechanics of Ceausescu\u0027s agro-industrial policy: save money by cramming more and more people under one roof, like cattle in pens. Goodbye to peasant autonomy, the picturesque settlements and village life; hello to the ugly, rearing tower blocks. And all the while the reins of political control drawn tighter.\\n\\n Through eyes three-quarters shuttered, Harry scanned the land as it sped by beyond the windows of the car. The roadside en route from Bucharest to Ploiesti looked like a landscape in the aftermath of war. Bulldozers worked in teams in the poisonous blue haze of their rumbling exhausts, erasing small farming communities wholesale to fashion empty, muddy acres in their place; while other machines stood idle or exhausted alongside huge iron diggers with their bucket heads lifted and stretching forward, almost as if watching. And where once there were villages, now there was only earth and rubble and desolation.\\n\\n \u0027More than ten thousand villages in old Romania,\u0027 Harry\u0027s driver, perhaps sensing that he was still awake, told him out of the corner of his mouth. \u0027But old President Nicholae reckons that\u0027s about five thousand too many. What a madman! Why, he\u0027d flatten the very mountains if someone would tell him how to go about it!\u0027\\n\\n Harry made no answer, continued to nod - but he wondered: and what of Faethor\u0027s place on the outskirts of Ploiesti? Will Ceausescu flatten that, too? Has he perhaps already flattened it?\\n\\n If so, then how might Harry find it again? The last time he was here he\u0027d come via the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum, homing in on Faethor\u0027s telepathic voice. (Or rather, his necroscopic voice, for it was only the dead Harry could speak to in this way; he wasn\u0027t a true telepath.) Faethor had spoken to him, and Harry had tracked him down. Now was different: he would only recognize Faethor\u0027s place, know it for sure, when he got there. As to its precise location: he knew only that the birds didn\u0027t sing there, and that the trees and bushes and brambles grew no flowers, developed no fruit. For the bees wouldn\u0027t go near them. The place was in itself Faethor\u0027s tombstone, bearing his epitaph which read:\\n\\n This Creature was Death! His Very\\n\\n existence was a Refutation\\n\\n of Life;\\n\\n wherefore he now lies Here,\\n\\n where Life Itself refuses to\\n\\n Acknowledge him.\\n\\n As the taxi passed a signpost stating that Ploiesti lay ten kilometres ahead, Harry shook himself, yawned, and pretended to come more properly awake. He looked at his driver.\\n\\n \u0027There were some rich old houses once on the outskirts of Ploiesti. The homes of the old aristocracy. Do you know where I mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Old houses?\u0027 The man squinted at him. \u0027Aristocracy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then the war came and they were bombed,\u0027 Harry continued. \u0027Reduced to so much rubble. The authorities never touched the place; it was left as a sort of memorial - until now, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah! I know it - or used to. But not on this road, no. On the old road, where it bends. Now tell me quick - is that where you want to go?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. Someone I know used to live there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Used to?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Still does, as far as I know,\u0027 Harry corrected himself.\\n\\n \u0027Hold on!\u0027 said the other, hauling his steering wheel hard right. They bumped off the road onto a cobbled avenue that wound away at a tangent under huge chestnuts.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s along here,\u0027 said Harry\u0027s driver. \u0027Another minute and I\u0027d passed it and would need to turn around and come back. Old houses, the old aristocracy, aye. I know it. But you came at the right time. Another year and it\u0027s gone. Your friend, too. They just knock \u0027em flat, these old places, and whoever lives there moves on or gets knocked down with \u0027em! Oh, the bulldozers will be here soon enough, wait and see...\u0027\\n\\n Half a mile down the road and Harry knew that this was it. The shells of old buildings began rising left and right behind the chestnuts, dilapidated places mainly, though a few of the chimneys still smoked. And: \u0027You can drop me here,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Getting out of the taxi and picking up his holdall, he asked, \u0027How about buses? I mean, if I stay with my friend overnight, how will I go about getting back into town tomorrow morning?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Walk back to the main road, towards Bucuresti,\u0027 the other told him. \u0027Cross over onto the right and keep walking. Every kilometre or so, there\u0027s a bus stop. You can\u0027t miss \u0027em. Except - don\u0027t go offering dollars! Here, you\u0027ve got some change coming. Banis, my Greek friend. Banis and leu - else people will wonder what\u0027s up!\u0027 And waving, he drove off in a cloud of dust.\\n\\n The rest of it was instinct; Harry just followed his nose; he would soon discover he\u0027d been a mile or so off target, but time and distance were passing quickly enough and he sensed he was walking in the right direction. He saw few signs of humanity: smoke from distant chimney-stacks, and an old peasant couple who passed him going in the opposite direction. They looked weary to the bone and pushed a cart piled high with sticks of furniture and personal belongings; without knowing them or their circumstances, still Harry felt sorry for them.\\n\\n Pretty soon he felt hungry, and remembering a pack of salami sandwiches and a bottle of German beer in his holdall, he left the road through a gate into an ancient cemetery. The graveyard didn\u0027t bother him; on the contrary, he felt at home there.\\n\\n It was as extensive as it was rundown, that old burial ground; Harry walked through the ranks of leaning, untended, lichen-crusted slabs until he reached the back wall, well away from the road. The old wall was two feet thick but crumbling in places; Harry climbed it where its stones had tumbled into steps and found himself a comfortable place to sit. The sunlight slanted onto him through the trees, reminding him that in just another hour the sun would be down. Before then he must be at Faethor\u0027s place. Still, he wasn\u0027t worried. He felt that he must be pretty close.\\n\\n Eating his sandwiches (which had kept remarkably well) and draining the sweet lager, he looked out over the sea of leaning slabs. There\u0027d been a time when the occupants of this place wouldn\u0027t have given him a minute\u0027s peace, and when he wouldn\u0027t have expected it. He\u0027d have been among friends here, all of them bursting to tell him what they\u0027d been thinking all these years. And it wouldn\u0027t matter at all that they were Romanian, for deadspeak -like its twin, telepathy - is universal. Harry would have understood them perfectly well, and to a man they\u0027d understand him.\\n\\n Ah, well... that was then and this was now. And now he was forbidden to speak with them. Except he must find a way to speak to Faethor.\\n\\n As that name crossed his mind so a cloud passed over the sun and the graveyard fell into shade. Harry shivered and for the first time turned and looked behind him, out of the cemetery. There were empty fields back there, criss-crossed with bramble-grown tracks and paths, where the land was humped in places and spotted with ruins, and the overgrown scars of old craters were still plainly visible. Closer to the main road a half-mile away, the ground had been made swampy where the bulldozers had been at work interfering with the natural drainage.\\n\\n Harry scanned the land with the eye of memory, superimposing the current scene and the scene remembered, and slowly the two pictures merged into one. And he knew that the taxi driver had been right: another year, maybe only a month, and he would be too late. For one of these crumbling piles was surely Faethor\u0027s, and pretty soon the bulldozers would level it, too, into the earth forever.\\n\\n Harry shivered again, got down from the wall on the other side and made his way from ruin to ruin, searching for the right one. And as evening turned to twilight he found and knew the place at once, just from its feel. The birds kept their distance, singing their muted evening songs in trees and bushes hundreds of yards away, so that they scarcely reached here at all; there were no bees or flying insects and the foliage bore neither flower nor fruit; even the common spiders kept well clear of Faethor\u0027s last place in all the world. It seemed a singular warning, and yet one which Harry must ignore.\\n\\n The place was not exactly as he remembered it. The absence of adequate drainage had threaded it with small, stagnant streams, where every slightest hollow had become a pool. A veritable swamp, normally it would be alive with mosquitoes, but of course it was not. At least Harry needn\u0027t worry about being bitten while he slept. But that (being bitten) was a thought he could well do without!\\n\\n In the deepening twilight he took out a sleeping-bag from his holdall and made down his bed on a grassy hump within low, ivy-clad walls. Before settling he answered the call of nature behind a crumbling mound of rubble some little way apart, and returning to his place saw that he wasn\u0027t entirely alone here. At least the small Romanian bats weren\u0027t afraid of this place; they flitted silently overhead, then swept away to do their hunting elsewhere. Perhaps in their way they paid homage to the ancient, evil Thing which had died here.\\n\\n Harry smoked one of his rare cigarettes, then tossed away the stub like a tiny meteorite in the night to sizzle out in a small pool of water. Finally he pulled up the zipper on his sleeping-bag and made himself as comfortable as possible, and prepared to face whatever his dreams would conjure...\\n\\n Harry? The monstrous, gurgling voice was there at once, touching upon his sleeping mind without preamble. So, and it would seem that you have come. It sounded as close and vibrant as if-a living person spoke to him, and Harry sensed no small measure of satisfaction in it. But in his dream, try as he may, he couldn\u0027t remember what he was doing here. Oh, he knew Faethor\u0027s mental voice well enough, but not why the vampire had chosen to seek him out. Unless it was to torment him. And so he kept silent, for the one thing he did remember was that he was forbidden to speak to the dead.\\n\\n What, all of that again? Faethor was impatient. Now listen to me, Harry Keogh: I didn\u0027t seek you out but the other way around. It is you who visits me here in Romania. And as for being forbidden to speak to me - or to the dead in general - surely that is why you are here, so that I may undo what has been done to you?\\n\\n \u0027But ... if I speak to you,\u0027 Harry paused and waited for the pain to strike him down, which it did not, \u0027there\u0027s this pain that comes and -\u0027\\n\\n And has it come? No, because you are asleep and dreaming. Conscious, you may not converse with me. But you are not conscious. Now tell me, pray, may we get on?\\n\\n Now Harry remembered: asleep, his deadspeak couldn\u0027t hurt him. Oh yes, he remembered that now -and more than that. \u0027I came ... to find out about Janos Ferenczy!\u0027\\n\\n Indeed, Faethor answered, that is one of the reasons why you are here. But it is not the only one. Before we consider all of that, however, first answer me this: did you come here of your own free will?\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m here out of necessity,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027because there are vampires in my world again.\u0027\\n\\n But did you come as a free man, as you yourself willed it? Or were you compelled by force, cajoled or coerced against your own natural desires?\\n\\n By now Harry was fully \u0027awake\u0027 in his dream and more surely aware of the vampire\u0027s wiles. Moreover, he\u0027d grown as skilled in their word-games as the Wamphyri themselves and knew that they were only a form of verbal manoeuvring. \u0027Compelled?\u0027 he said. \u0027Well, no one pushed me. Coerced? On the contrary, my friends would have kept me back! But cajoled? Only by you, old devil, only by you.\u0027\\n\\n By me? Faethor played the innocent. How so? You have a problem and I have the answer. Someone reached inside your head, grabbed up your brains and tied a knot in them. I can perhaps untie it - if I feel inclined. Which I may not, so long as you create obstacles and make these accusations! So tell me quickly now: how have I cajoled you? In what way?\\n\\n \u0027The way I understand it,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027the word \"cajole\" has several meanings. To coax or persuade with flattery; to wheedle; to make delusive promises. It is to allure or inveigle so as to derive a point of personal gain. These are the meanings of the word. Ah, but when a vampire cajoles... then the object of the exercise is far less clear. And the consequences frequently dire.\u0027\\n\\n Hah! Harry sensed Faethor\u0027s exasperation, and his astonishment that a mere human being should attempt to try him with one of his own games! But he also sensed the vampire\u0027s shrug of indifference, and perhaps of finality. And: Well, said Faethor, that says it all! You do not trust me. So be it; your journey is wasted; wake up and get yourself gone! I had thought we were friends, but I was mistaken. In which case... what care I that there are vampires in your world? To hell with your world, and with you, Harry Keogh!\\n\\n Harry wasn\u0027t about to fall for that one. He was supposed to plead now, for Faethor\u0027s audience. But Faethor would never have called him here just to dismiss him so casually. It was simply the way of vampires, that was all. A ploy to gain the upper hand. But just as some dreams are brilliantly clear and real as life, so this one was developing. Within it, Harry\u0027s wits were grown razor sharp.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s have it out in the open, Faethor,\u0027 he said, abruptly. \u0027For it suddenly dawns on me that while we\u0027ve talked now and then, you and I, we\u0027ve never actually met face to face. And I feel certain that if I could only see your earnest, honest face, why, then I\u0027d be that much more at ease in your presence - and not need to stay so firm on guard!\u0027\\n\\n Oh? said the other, as if surprised. And are you still here? But I could swear our conversation was at an end. Or perhaps you didn\u0027t understand me. Then let me make myself plain: GO AWAY!\\n\\n Harry\u0027s turn to shrug. \u0027Very well. And no great loss. For let\u0027s face it, I could never have relied on anything you said, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n What? Now Faethor was furious. And how many times have I assisted you, Harry Keogh? And how often have I borne you up, when 1 could - and should - have let you founder?\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve had this conversation before,\u0027 said Harry, unperturbed. \u0027Must we play it out again? If my memory serves me well, we agreed in a previous time that former liaisons had been to our \"mutual\" advantage: neither one of us gained more than the other.\" So come down off your high horse and tell me truly, why now do you insist on this sinister ritual that I should come to you of my own free will? And if I admit as much, under what obligation will I place myself, eh?\u0027\\n\\n Ahhh! sighed Faethor, after a moment. And if only it could have been you, Harry Keogh, instead of blood-crazed Thibor or that scheming, devious lout Janos! If only I had chosen my sons more carefully, eh? Why, such as you and I could have ruled the world together! But... too late now, for Thibor got my egg and Janos was my bloodson. And now there\u0027s neither spark nor spunk left of me to form another.\\n\\n \u0027If I thought for a moment there was, Faethor\u0027 (and\\n\\n even dreaming Harry shivered), \u0027then believe me I wouldn\u0027t be here!\u0027\\n\\n But you are here, and so I beg of you, observe the formalities, that ancient \u0027ritual\u0027 of which you speak so harshly and suspiciously.\\n\\n \u0027So now you beg of me,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027and still I ask myself; what\u0027s in it for you?\u0027\\n\\n Aye, and we\u0027ve had that conversation before, too! Faethor cried. Well then, if I must repeat myself: that bloodspawn of mine - that child of my human side, Janos - walks in the world of men again, and I cannot bear it! When Thibor was desperate to be up and about, who was it came to your aid in keeping him down, eh? I did, for I loathed the dog! And now it\u0027s the turn of Janos. What\u0027s in it for me, you ask? Well, when you destroy him, you might remember to tell, him how his father helped you, and even now lies laughing in his grave. That will be profit enough.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry, speaking (and thinking) slowly and very carefully. \u0027But surely that would be a lie, for nothing at all of you lies in any grave. You burned up in the fire that destroyed your house - didn\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n But you know I did! the other cried. But still I am here, in a manner of speaking, for how else could I talk to you? It is my ghost, my spirit, the echo of a voice long vanished, that you hear. It is your talent, your ability to speak with the dead, which in itself should be evidence enough of my extinction!\\n\\n Harry was silent a while. He knew that it was tit for tat, this for that, and that he\u0027d get nothing without first giving something. Faethor was eager, indeed insistent, that his rules should apply in any exchange here. And in the end it was plain the vampire would have his way, for Harry\u0027s cause was doomed without him. He thought these things, but yet contrived to hide such thoughts from Faethor.\\n\\n Ah-ha! And now I see it! the other finally burst out.\\n\\n You are afraid of me, Harry Keogh! Of me, a long-dead thing, burned up and melted away in a holocaust! But why now? What is different now? We are not strangers. This is not the first time we\u0027ve come together for a common cause.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027but it\u0027s certainly the first time I\u0027ve bedded down with you! I\u0027ve been here before, yes, but when I was awake. And other than that I\u0027ve only ever spoken to you across great distances, again via deadspeak, when there was no possible danger to me. And if there\u0027s one thing I\u0027ve learned about vampires, Faethor, it\u0027s that when they seem at their most vulnerable, that\u0027s when they\u0027re most dangerous.\u0027\\n\\n We\u0027re arguing at odds, getting nowhere, said the vampire, almost despairingly. But for all the \u0027fatigue\u0027 he displayed, still Harry guessed that Faethor wouldn\u0027t be moved from his stand in this matter. Which meant there remained only one way to break the deadlock.\\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 he said, \u0027and so one of us must give way. Perhaps I\u0027m a fool, but... yes, I came of my own free will.\u0027\\n\\n Good! the vampire grunted at once, and Harry could almost sense him smacking his lips. A most wise and agreeable decision. And why not? For if I\u0027m to observe your manners and customs, why should not you observe mine, eh? They loved to win, these creatures, even in so small a thing as a contest of words. Perhaps that was all to the good, for now Faethor might find room to give way in other matters. And as if he had read Harry\u0027s thoughts:\\n\\n And now we may face each other on equal terms. You desired to speak to me face to face? So be it.\\n\\n Until now the dream had been blank and grey and unyielding, a place without substance except in the exchange of thoughts. But now the grey took on a gently swirling motion and rapidly dissolved down to a thickly misted plain under a slender horned moon. Harry sat on a ruined wall with his feet dangling in the ground mist where it lapped at his ankles; and Faethor, seated upon a heap of rubble, was a dark figure in a shrouding robe, whose hood cast his face in shadows. Only his eyes burned in that hollow darkness, and they were like tiny scarlet lamps.\\n\\n And is this more to your liking, Harry Keogh?\\n\\n \u0027I know this place,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n Of course you do, for it is the same place but perceived as it shall be some small distance in the future. Oh yes, for that was one of my talents, too: to see a little way into the future. Alas, it was unreliable, else I\u0027d not have been here that night they dropped their bombs.\\n\\n \u0027I see that the bulldozers have been at work,\u0027 Harry looked all around. \u0027This place of yours seems the only place left!\u0027\\n\\n For the moment, aye, Faethor answered. A ruin on a low plain, surrounded by mud and debris, soon to become an industrial complex. And even if there were ears to hear me, who would listen to me then? What, through all of that hubbub and mechanical chaos? How are the mighty fallen, Harry Keogh, that I am reduced to this? And perhaps now you can understand why Thibor was made to suffer, and in the end destroyed; and why Janos must go the same way. They could have had it all, everything, and instead chose to defy me. And should I haunt this place, alone, unloved and unremembered, while one of them is returned to the world, perhaps to become a power? Perhaps The Power? No, I shall not rest, until I know that Janos is as little or even less than I am - which is nothing.\\n\\n \u0027And I\u0027m to be your instrument?\u0027\\n\\n Is it not what you want? Do not our objectives coincide?\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Harry agreed, \u0027except I want it for the safety of a world, and you want it for your own selfish spite. They were your sons, Thibor and Janos. Whatever it is in them which you hate, they got it from you. It\u0027s a strange father who\u0027ll murder his own sons because they take too well after him!\u0027\\n\\n Faethor gloomed on him and his voice turned sly and insinuating. Is it, Harry? Is it? And you\u0027re the expert, are you? Ah, but of course - certainly you would understand such things -for I\u0027ve heard it that you have a son, too...\\n\\n Harry was silent; he had no answer; perhaps he would destroy his son if he could, or at least change him. But hadn\u0027t he also tried to change the Lady Karen?\\n\\n Faethor took his silence as something else: a sign that perhaps he went too far. Now he was quick to change his tone. But there, the circumstances are different. And anyway, you are a man and I am Wamphyri. There can be no meeting point except in our dual purpose. So let\u0027s make an end of criticisms and accusations and such, for there\u0027s work to be done.\\n\\n Harry was pleased to change the subject. \u0027These are the simple facts,\u0027 he said. \u0027We both want Janos put down again, permanently. Neither one of us can do it on his own. For you it is absolutely impossible. Likewise for me, without my gift of deadspeak. You say you can return that talent to me; that since it was taken from me by a vampire, only a vampire can return it. Very well, I believe you. What will it entail?\u0027\\n\\n Faethor sighed and seemed to slump down a little where he sat. He turned his red-glowing eyes away and looked out over the plain of mist. And: We are come to that part from which I know you will shy most violently. And yet it is unavoidable.\\n\\n \u0027Say it,\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n The trouble lies in your head. A creature other than yourself has visited the labyrinth caves of your mind and wrought certain changes there. Let us say that within your house the furniture has been rearranged. Now another must go in and put the place in order.\\n\\n \u0027You want me to let you into my mind?\u0027\\n\\n You must invite me in, said Faethor, and I must enter of my own free will.\\n\\n Harry recalled to mind all he knew about vampires, and said, \u0027When Thibor entered Dragosani\u0027s mind, he tried to steer it his way. He interfered in Dragosani\u0027s affairs. When he touched the living foetus which would become Yulian Bodescu, that was sufficient to alter the child entirely and turn him into a monster. And again Thibor was in Yulian\u0027s mind, able to communicate with him and guide - or direct him - even over great distances. At this very moment a friend of mine on the island of Rhodes has a vampire, your bloodson Janos, in his mind, or at least controlling it. And my friend exists in a hell of terror and torment. And you want me to let you into my mind?\u0027\\n\\n I said you would shy from it.\\n\\n \u0027If I let it happen this once, how may I be sure it won\u0027t happen when I don\u0027t want it?\u0027\\n\\n I would remind you: distance removed Dragosani from danger. Even if what you suggest were possible, do you intend to stay here in Romania forever? No, for you have your own way to go, which will put you far beyond my reach. I would further remind you: Thibor was an undead thing in the ground - he was real, solid, intact in all his parts - while I am but a wraith, dead and gone forever. A ghost, aye: empty, immaterial, incorporeal, and of no consequence whatsoever.\\n\\n \u0027Except to a Necroscope.\u0027\\n\\n Except to you, Faethor\u0027s shade nodded its agreement, the man who talks to and befriends the dead. Or used to.\\n\\n \u0027So how do we go about it?\u0027 Harry asked. \u0027I\u0027m no telepath, with a mind like a book to be read.\u0027\\n\\n But in a way you are, Faethor told him. Is it not a form of telepathy, to be able to talk to the dead? Also, when you too were without body, did you not speak to the living?\\n\\n \u0027That was a strange time,\u0027 Harry agreed. \u0027It was my deadspeak. It worked in reverse. Being incorporeal, I had no voice, and so I could talk to the living - to those who had body - in the same way I talked to the dead!\u0027\\n\\n Again Faethor\u0027s nod. There\u0027s more to your mind than even you suspect, Harry Keogh. And I say I can be into it even as Thibor was into Dragosani\u0027s! - but without the complications.\\n\\n Harry sensed Faethor\u0027s eagerness. He was far too eager. But there was no way round it. \u0027What do I have to do?\u0027\\n\\n Nothing. Simply relax. Sleep a dreamless sleep. And I shall visit within your mind.\\n\\n Harry felt Faethor\u0027s beguilement - his hypnotism -working on him and resisted it. \u0027Wait! Three things I want. And if your mind-tricks work, perhaps a fourth, later.\u0027\\n\\n Name them.\\n\\n \u0027First, that you undo the mischief done to my mind and return my deadspeak, as agreed. Second, that you give me some sort of defence against Janos\u0027s telepathy, for I\u0027ve seen what he can do to minds such as mine. Third, that you look and see if there\u0027s any way I can regain access to the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. It\u0027s the ultimate weapon against Janos and would surely tilt the odds in my favour.\u0027\\n\\n And the fourth?\\n\\n \u0027When - if - I have my deadspeak back, I\u0027ll be able to find you again no matter where I am. And then, hopefully for the last time, I may ask for your help again. To free the mind of my friend Trevor Jordan, which Janos holds enthralled.\u0027\\n\\n As for this last thing, the vampire answered, if it can be done, then it shall be done in due course. But alas, access to this device of yours - teleportation? - we shall see what we shall see. However, I doubt it. It was not an art of mine; I know nothing of it; how may I unriddle something in a language I cannot speak? The language of mathematics is a stranger to me. On the other hand, your deadspeak is something I can surely put back to rights, for I understand it. Even when they were dead many hundred years, still my Szgany answered my call and got up from their graves! Lastly, you ask for some sort of defence against Janos\u0027s mindspells. Well, that is no simple thing; it\u0027s not any sort of gift I can will or bestow upon you. But later I shall describe to you how to fight fire with fire. Which may help... if you can stand the heat of it.\\n\\n \u0027Faethor,\u0027 Harry was almost completely resigned to his fate now, \u0027I wonder, will I thank you for this when it\u0027s done? Will there ever be thanks enough? Or will I curse you for all eternity, and will there ever be curses enough? Even now you could be plotting to destroy me, as you\u0027ve destroyed everything else you ever touched. And yet... it seems I\u0027ve no choice.\u0027\\n\\n These things are not entirely true, Harry, Faethor answered. Destroyed things? Aye, I\u0027ve done that - and brought a few into being, too. Nor are you without choice. Indeed it seems to me the very simplest matter. Trust me now as an ally tried and true, or begone from here and wait for Janos to seek you out - and when the time is come go up against him like a child, naked and innocent of all his ways and wiles.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve talked enough,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027And we both know there\u0027s only one course open to me. Let\u0027s waste no more time.\u0027\\n\\n And: Sleep, said Faethor, his mental voice deep and dark as a bottomless pool of blood. Sleep a dreamless sleep, Harry Keogh, leaving all the doors of your mind standing open to me. Sleep, and let me see inside. Ah, but even though you may will it freely, still I shall find certain doors closed to me - and closed to you! These are the ones which I must unlock. For beyond them lie all your talents, which your son has hidden from you.\\n\\n Sleep, Harry. We are the betrayed, you and I, by our own flesh and blood. We have this much in common, at least. Nay, more than this, for we\u0027ve both been powers in our time. And you shall be ... a power... again... Haaarry Keeooogh!\\n\\n The mist on the plain swirled as Faethor flowed to his feet and approached Harry where he slumped on the broken wall. The long dead vampire reached out a hand towards Harry\u0027s face... and the hand was white and skeletal, projecting from the fretted sleeve of his robe like a bundle of thin sticks. The bony fingers touched Harry\u0027s pale brow, and melted into his skull.\\n\\n And as the scarlet fires dimmed in the sockets of Faethor\u0027s eyes, so their light was transferred beneath Harry\u0027s lowered lids, like red candles behind frosted glass. Following which... the vampire was privy to Harry\u0027s most secret things: his thoughts and memories and passions, his very mind.\\n\\n Until, after what might have been moments or millennia:\\n\\n Wake up! said Faethor.\\n\\n Harry came out of the dream with a sneeze; and a second sneeze even as he realized he was truly awake. He rolled his head a little in the hood of his sleeping-bag, and something made a soft bursting sound close by. In the faint dawn light, he saw a ring of small black mushrooms or puffballs where they\u0027d grown up beside his bed in the night. Already they were rotting, bursting open at the slightest movement, releasing their spores in peppery clouds. Harry sneezed again and sat up.\\n\\n For a moment his dream was there in his mind, but already fading as most dreams do. He strove to remember it ... and it was gone. He knew he\u0027d conversed with the spirit of Faethor Ferenczy, but that was all. If anything had passed between them, Harry couldn\u0027t say what it had been. Certainly he felt no different from when he went to sleep.\\n\\n Oh? said Faethor. And are you sure of that, Harry Keogh?\\n\\n \u0027Jesus!\u0027 Harry jumped a foot. \u0027Who... ?\u0027 He looked all about, saw no one.\\n\\n And did you think I would fail you? said Faethor.\\n\\n \u0027Deadspeak!\u0027 Harry whispered.\\n\\n It is returned to you. There, see now how Faethor Ferenczy keeps his word.\\n\\n Harry had unzipped his sleeping-bag and scrambled to his feet in the dispersing morning mist. Now he sat down again, with something of a bump. There was no pain in his head; no one squirted acid in his mind; his talent seemed returned to him in full measure.\\n\\n All that remained was to try it out. And:\\n\\n \u0027Faethor?\u0027 he said, still wincing inside and expecting to be struck down. \u0027Was it... difficult?\u0027\\n\\n Difficult enough, aye, the dead vampire\u0027s voice sounded tired. What had been done to you was the work of an expert! All night I laboured to rid your house of his infestation, Harry. You may now gauge for yourself the measure of my success.\\n\\n Harry stood up again. With his heart in his mouth, he attempted to conjure a M\u0026ouml;bius door ... to no avail. The equations evolving, mutating and multiplying with awesome acceleration on the computer screens of his mind were completely alien to him; he couldn\u0027t fathom them individually, let alone as a total concept or entity. He sighed and said: \u0027Well, I\u0027m grateful to you - indeed, you\u0027ll never know just how grateful I am - but you weren\u0027t entirely successful.\u0027\\n\\n Faethor\u0027s answer, with his bodiless shrug sensed superimposed upon it, was half-apologetic: I warned you it might be so. Oh, I found the region of the trouble, be sure, and even managed to unlock several of its doors. But beyond them -\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n - There was nothing! No time, no space, nothing at all. Very frightening places, Harry, and strange to think that they exist right there in your mind - in your entirely human mind! I felt that to take one single step over those thresholds would mean being sucked in and lost forever beyond the boundaries of the universe. Needless to say, I took no such step. And in any case, no sooner had I opened these doors than they slammed themselves shut in my face. For which I was not ungrateful.\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027You looked in on the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum,\u0027 he said. And: \u0027When I\u0027ve finished here, I must try to find him. M\u0026ouml;bius, I mean. For just as you\u0027re the expert in your field, so he\u0027s the one true authority in his. Useless to seek him out until now, for without deadspeak I couldn\u0027t talk to him.\u0027\\n\\n Will you do it now, at once? Faethor was fascinated. I am interested in genius. There is a kinship in all true geniuses, Harry. For however far removed their various talents, into whichever spheres, still the obsession remains the same. They seek to eliminate all imperfections. Where this M\u0026ouml;bius has approached the very limits of pure numbers, I myself have searched for purest pure evil. We stand on the opposite sides of a great gulf, but still we are brothers of a sort. Yes, and it would be fascinating to meet such a one.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Harry automatically shook his head, and knew that Faethor would sense it, \u0027I won\u0027t look for him now.\\n\\n Eventually, but not now. After I\u0027ve practised a while and when I\u0027ve convinced myself that my deadspeak is as good as it used to be, maybe then.\u0027\\n\\n As you wish. And for the moment? Do you go now to seek out Janos?\\n\\n Harry rolled up his sleeping-bag and stuffed it into his holdall. \u0027That too, eventually,\u0027 he answered. \u0027But first I\u0027ll return to my friends in Rhodes and see how they\u0027re faring. And before any of that there are still things you must tell me. I still want to know all about Janos; the better a man knows his enemy, the easier it is to defeat him. Also, I need to know how to defend myself against him.\u0027\\n\\n Of course! said Faethor. Indeed! I had forgotten there was work still to be done. But only see how eager I am that you should be on your way. Ah, but I go too fast! And certainly you are right: you must have every possible weapon at your disposal, if you\u0027re to defeat him. As to how you may best defend yourself, that\u0027s not easy. This sort of thing is inherent in the Wamphyri, but difficult to teach. Even the keenest instinct would not suffice, for this is something borne in the blood. If we had an entire week together...\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 again Harry shook his head, \u0027out of the question. Can\u0027t you break it down into its simplest terms for me? If I\u0027m not too stupid I might just catch on.\u0027\\n\\n I can but try, said Faethor.\\n\\n Harry lit a cigarette, sat down on his stuffed holdall and said, \u0027Go ahead.\u0027\\n\\n Again Faethor\u0027s shrug, and he at once commenced: Janos is without doubt the finest telepath - which is to say beguiler, enchanter, fascinator - I have ever known. Wherefore he will first attempt an invasion of your mind. Now as I\u0027ve hinted, and as is surely self-evident, your mind is extraordinary, Harry. Well, of course it is: for you are the Necroscope! But where you have practised only good, Janos, like myself in my time, has practised only evil. And because you know he is evil, so you fear him and what he may do to you. Do you understand?\\n\\n \u0027Of course. None of this is new to me.\u0027\\n\\n To anyone less well versed in the ways of the Wamphyri, such is the awe - the sheer terror - Janos would inspire, that his victim would be paralysed. But you are not ignorant of our ways; indeed you are an expert in your own right. Do you know the saying, that the best form of defence is attack?\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve heard it, yes.\u0027\\n\\n I suspect that in this instance it would be true.\\n\\n \u0027I should attack him? With my mind?\u0027\\n\\n Instead of shrinking back from him when you sense him near, seek him out! He would enter your mind? Enter his! He will expect you to be afraid; be bold! He will threaten; brush all such threats aside and strike! But above all else, do not let his evil weaken you. When he yawns his great jaws at you, go in through them, for he\u0027s softer on the inside!\\n\\n \u0027Is that all?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If I say more, I fear it would only confuse you. And who knows? You may learn more about Janos from his story than from any measures of mine to forearm you. Moreover, I\u0027m weary from a long night\u0027s work. Ask me what has been, by all means, but not what is yet to be. True, I have been an observer of times, but as my current situation is surely witness, I was far too often in error.\\n\\n Harry thought about what he\u0027d learned: Faethor\u0027s \u0027advice\u0027 about how to deal with a mind-attack from Janos. Some might consider it suicidal to act in accordance with such instructions; the Necroscope wasn\u0027t so sure. In any case, it seemed very little to go on. But patently it was all he was going to get. Dawning daylight had apparently dampened the vampire\u0027s enthusiasm.\\n\\n Harry stood up, stretched and looked all around.\\n\\n The mist had thinned to nothing; a handful of gaunt houses stood beyond a hedge half a mile away; in the other direction, the silhouettes of diggers and bulldozers were like dinosaurs frozen on a grey horizon. Another hour and they\u0027d roar into destructive mechanical life, as if the sun had warmed their joints to clanking motion.\\n\\n Harry looked at the ground where he stood, the spot where Faethor had died on the night Ladislau Giresci cut off his head in the ruins of a bomb-blasted, burning house. He saw the now liquescent mushrooms there, their spores like red stains on the grass and soil; and in the eye of his mind he saw Faethor, too, the skeletal, shrouded thing he\u0027d been in his dream. \u0027Are you up to telling me Janos\u0027s story?\u0027 he asked, apparently of no one.\\n\\n That will be no effort at all but a pleasure, the other answered at once. It was my pleasure to spawn him, and it gave me the most exquisite pleasure to put him down again!\\n\\n But first... do you remember the story of Thibor in his early days? How he robbed me of my castle in the Khorvaty? And how I, most sorely injured, fled westwards? Let me remind you, then.\\n\\n This was how it was... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iv-deadspeak-necroscope-4/page-9.html","bookId":2437,"book":{"id":2437,"title":"Necroscope IV: Deadspeak (Necroscope #4)","description":"Storyline: Several years after his return to earth Harry Sr. is trouble by nightmares of resurgent Vampires.
