He looked at his change but didn\u0027t try to check it. It wouldn\u0027t make any sense to him anyway. They could rip him off every time and he just wouldn\u0027t know it.\\n\\n That was the other thing Harry Jnr had done to him: he was now innumerate. No way he could use the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum if he couldn\u0027t even calculate the change from a pack of cigarettes! Sandra saw to it that his bills were paid, or he\u0027d probably get that wrong, too. What price his \u0027instinctive mathematics\u0027 now, eh? The M\u0026ouml;bius equations? What the hell were they? What had they looked like?\\n\\n And again Harry wondered: was it a dream? Was that all it had been? A fantasy? A figment of his own imagination? Oh, he remembered how it had been, all right; but as he\u0027d tried to explain to Sandra, it was the way you remember a dream, or a book you read in childhood, fast fading now. Had he really, really, done all of those things? And if he had, did he really, really, want to be able to do them again? To talk to the teeming dead, and step through doors no one else guessed existed to travel swift as thought in the metaphysical M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum?\\n\\n Want it? Perhaps not, but what was there without it? What was he without it? Answer: Harry Keogh, nowhere man.\\n\\n Back home he went into the garden and looked at the stones again:\\n\\n KENL\\n\\n TJOR\\n\\n RH\\n\\n They meant nothing to him. But still he fixed their meaningless legend in his mind. Then he brought the wheelbarrow, loaded it up and wheeled the stones back to the wall where ... he paused a moment and stood frowning, before wheeling them back up to the lawn again. And there he left them, in the wheelbarrow.\\n\\n For if - just if - someone was trying to tell him something, well, why make things harder for them?\\n\\n Indoors again, Harry climbed stairs and then ladders to the attic room which no one else suspected was there -that large, dusty room with its sloping rear window, naked light-bulb hanging from a roof timber, and its rows and rows of bookshelves - which was now a shrine to his obsession, if the word \u0027shrine\u0027 were at all applicable. And of course the books themselves. All the facts and the fictions were here, all the myths and legends, all the \u0027conclusive condemnations\u0027 and \u0027indisputable evidences\u0027 for or against, proving, disproving or standing in the middle ground of Harry\u0027s studies. The history, the lore, the very nature ... of the vampire.\\n\\n Which was in itself a grim joke, for how could anyone ever fully understand the nature of the vampire? And yet if any man could, then it was Harry Keogh.\\n\\n But he hadn\u0027t come here today to look again at his books or delve a little deeper into the miasma of times, lands and legends long past. No, for he believed that time itself was well past for those things, for study and vain attempts at understanding. His dreams of red threads among the blue were immediate things, \u0027now\u0027 things, and if he\u0027d learned nothing else in his weird life it was to trust in his dreams.\\n\\n The Wamphyri have powers, father!\\n\\n An echo? A whisper? The scurry of mice? Or ... a memory?\\n\\n How long before they seek you out and find you?\\n\\n No, he wasn\u0027t here to look at his books this time. The time to study an enemy\u0027s tactics is before the onslaught. Too late if he\u0027s already come a-knocking at your door. Well, he hadn\u0027t, not yet. But Harry had dreamed things, and he trusted his dreams.\\n\\n He took down a piece of modern weaponry (yes, modern, though its design hadn\u0027t changed much through sixteen centuries) from the wall and carried it to a table where he laid it down on newspapers preparatory to cleaning, oiling and generally servicing the thing. There was this, and in the corner there a sickle whose semicircular blade gleamed like a razor, and that was all.\\n\\n Strange weapons, these, against a force for blight and plague and devastation potentially greater than any of Man\u0027s thermonuclear toys. But right now they were the only weapons Harry had.\\n\\n Better tend to them...\\n\\n The afternoon passed without incident; why shouldn\u0027t it? Years had passed without incident, within the parameters of the Harry Keogh mentality and identity. He spent most of the time considering his position (which was this: that he was no longer a Necroscope, that he no longer had access to the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum), and ways in which he might improve that position and recover his talents before they atrophied utterly.\\n\\n It was possible - barely, Harry supposed, considering his innumeracy - that if he could speak to M\u0026ouml;bius, then M\u0026ouml;bius might be able to stabilize whatever mathematical gyro was now out of kilter in his head. Except first he must be able to speak to him, which was likewise out of the question. For of course M\u0026ouml;bius had been dead for well over a hundred years, and Harry was forbidden to speak to the dead on penalty of mental agony.\\n\\n He could not speak to the dead, but the dead might even now be looking at ways in which they could communicate with him. He suspected - no, he more than suspected, was sure - that he spoke to them in his dreams, even though he was forbidden to remember or act upon what they had told him. But still he was aware that warnings had been passed, even if he didn\u0027t know what those warnings were about.\\n\\n One thing was certain, however: he knew that within himself and within every man, woman and child on the surface of the globe, a blue thread unwound from the past and was even now spinning into the future of humanity, and that he had dreamed - or been warned - of red threads amidst the blue.\\n\\n And apart from that - this inescapable mood or sensation of something impending, something terrible - the rest of it was a Chinese puzzle with no solution, a maze with no exit, the square root of minus one, whose value may only be expressed in the abstract. Harry knew the latter for a fact, even if he no longer knew what it meant. And it was a puzzle he\u0027d examined almost to distraction, a maze he\u0027d explored to exhaustion, and an equation he hadn\u0027t even attempted because like all mathematical concepts it simply wouldn\u0027t read.\\n\\n In the evening he sat and watched television, mainly for relaxation. He\u0027d considered calling Sandra, and then hadn\u0027t. There was something on her mind, too, he knew; and anyway, what right had he to draw her into... whatever this was, or whatever it might turn out to be? None.\\n\\n So it went; evening drew towards night; Harry prepared for bed, only to sit dozing in his chair. The dish in his garden collected signals and unscrambled their pictures onto his screen. He started awake at the sound of applause, and discovered an American chat-show host talking to a fat lady who had the most human, appealing eyes Harry could imagine. The show was called \u0027Interesting People\u0027 or some such and Harry had watched it before. Usually it was anything but interesting; but now he caught the word \u0027extrasensory\u0027 and sat up a little straighter. Naturally enough, he found ESP in all its forms entirely fascinating.\\n\\n \u0027So ... let\u0027s get this right,\u0027 the skeletally thin host said to the fat lady. \u0027You went deaf when you were eighteen months old, and so never learned how to speak, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 the fat lady answered, \u0027but I do have this incredible memory, and obviously I\u0027d heard a great many human conversations before I went deaf. Anyway, speech never developed in me, so I wasn\u0027t only deaf but dumb, too. Then, three years ago, I got married. My husband is a technician in a recording studio. He took me in one day and I watched him working, and I suddenly made the connection between the oscillating sensors on his machinery and the voices and instrument sounds of the group he was recording.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Suddenly, you got the idea of sound, right?\u0027\\n\\n That\u0027s correct,\u0027 the fat lady smiled, and continued: \u0027Now, I had of course learned sign-language or dactylology - which in my mind I\u0027d called dumbspeak - and I also knew that some deaf people could carry on perfectly normal conversations, which I termed \u0027deafspeak\u0027. But I hadn\u0027t tried it myself simply because I hadn\u0027t understood sound! You see, my deafness was total. Absolute. Sound didn\u0027t exist - except in my memory!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And so you saw this hypnotist?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Indeed I did. It was hard but he was patient - and of course it mightn\u0027t have been possible at all except he was able to use dumbspeak. So he hypnotized me and brought back all the conversations I\u0027d heard as a baby. And when I woke up -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - You could speak?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly as you hear me now, yes!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The hell you say! Not only fully articulate but almost entirely without accent! Mrs Zdzienicki, that\u0027s a most fascinating story and you really are one of the most Interrrresting People we\u0027ve ever had on this show!\u0027\\n\\n The camera stayed on his thin, smiling face and he nodded his head in frenetic affirmation. \u0027Yessiree! And now, let\u0027s move on to - \u0027\\n\\n But Harry had already moved, to switch off the set; and as the screen blinked out he saw how dark it had grown. Almost midnight, and the house temperature already falling as the timer cut power to the central heating system. It was time he was in bed ...\\n\\n ... Or, maybe he\u0027d watch just one more interview with one of these Interrrrresting People! He didn\u0027t remember switching the set on again, but as its picture formed he was drawn in through the screen where he found Jack Garrulous or whatever his name was adrift in the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum.\\n\\n \u0027Welcome to the show, Harry!\u0027 said Jack. \u0027And we just know we\u0027re going to find you verrry interesting! Now, I\u0027ve been sort of admiring this, er, place you\u0027ve got here. What did you say it was called?\u0027 He held out his microphone for Harry to speak into.\\n\\n \u0027This is the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum, Jack,\u0027 said Harry, a little nervously, \u0027and I\u0027m not really supposed to be here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The hell you say! But on this show anything goes, Harry. You\u0027re on prime-time, son, so don\u0027t be shy!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Time?\u0027 Harry said. \u0027But all time is prime, Jack. Is time what you\u0027re interested in? Well, in that case, take a look in here.\u0027 And grabbing Garrulous by the elbow he guided him through a future-time door.\\n\\n \u0027Interrrresting!\u0027 the other approved, as side by side they shot into the future, towards that far faint haze of blue which was the expansion of humanity through the three mundane dimensions of the space-time universe. \u0027And what are these myriad blue threads, Harry?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The life-threads of the human race,\u0027 Harry explained. \u0027See over there? That one just this moment bursting into being, such a pure, shining blue that it\u0027s almost blinding? That\u0027s a newborn baby with a long, long way to go. And this one here, gradually fading and getting ready to blink out?\u0027 He lowered his voice in respect. \u0027Well, that\u0027s an old man about to die.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The hell - you - say!\u0027 said Jack Garrulous, awed. \u0027But of course, you\u0027d know all about that, now wouldn\u0027t you, Harry? I mean, about death and such? For after all, aren\u0027t you the one they call a Necrowhatsit?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A Necroscope, yes,\u0027 Harry nodded. \u0027Or at least I was.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how\u0027s that for a talent, folks?\u0027 Garrulous beamed with teeth like piano keys. \u0027For Harry Keogh\u0027s the man who talks to the dead! And he\u0027s the only one they\u0027ll talk back to - but in the nicest possible way! See, they kind of love him. So,\u0027 (he turned back to Harry), \u0027what do you call that sort of conversation, Harry? I mean, when you\u0027re talking to dead folks? See, a little while ago we were speaking to this Mrs Zdzienicki who told us all about dumbspeak and deafspeak and -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Deadspeak,\u0027 Harry cut him short.\\n\\n \u0027Deadspeak? Really? The hell ... you ... say! Well, if you haven\u0027t been one of the most Interrrr...\u0027 And he paused, squinting over Harry\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Um?\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027One last question, son,\u0027 said Garrulous, urgently, his narrowing eyes fixed on something just outside Harry\u0027s sphere of vision. \u0027I mean, you told us about the blue life-threads sure enough, but what in all get-out\u0027s the meaning of a red one, eh?\u0027\\n\\n Harry\u0027s head snapped round; wide-eyed, he stared; and saw a scarlet thread, even now angling in towards him! And:\\n\\n \u0027Vampire? he yelled, rolling out of his armchair into the darkness of the room. And framed in the doorway leading back into the rest of the house, he saw the silhouette of what could only be one thing: that which he\u0027d known was coming for him!\\n\\n There was a small table beside his chair, which Harry had knocked flying. Groping in the darkness, his fingers found two things: a table-lamp thrown to the floor, and the weapon he\u0027d worked on earlier in the day. The latter was loaded. Switching on the lamp, Harry went into a crouch behind his chair and brought up his gleaming metal crossbow into view - and saw that his worst nightmare had advanced into the room.\\n\\n There was no denying the thing: the slate-grey colour of its flesh, its gaping jaws and what they contained, its pointed ears and the high-collared cape which gave its skull and menacing features definition. It was a vampire -of the comic-book variety! But even realizing that this wasn\u0027t the real thing (and he of all people should know), still Harry\u0027s finger had tightened on the trigger.\\n\\n It was all reaction. This body he\u0027d trained to a peak of perfection was working just as he\u0027d programmed it to work in a hundred simulations of this very situation. And despite the fact that he\u0027d come immediately awake - and that he knew this thing in his room with him was a fraud - still his adrenalin was flowing and his heart pounding, and his weapon\u0027s fifteen-inch hardwood bolt already in flight. It was only in the last split second that he\u0027d tried to avert disaster by elevating the crossbow\u0027s tiller up towards the ceiling. But that had been enough, barely.\\n\\n Wellesley, seeing the crossbow in Harry\u0027s hand, had blown froth through his plastic teeth in a gasp of terror and tried to back off. The bolt missed his right ear by a hair\u0027s breadth, struck through the collar of his costume cape and snatched him back against the wall. It buried itself deep in plaster and old brick and pinned him there.\\n\\n He spat out his teeth and yelled: \u0027Jesus Christ, you idiot, it\u0027s me!\u0027 But this was as much for the benefit of Darcy Clarke, back there somewhere in the dark house, as for Harry Keogh. For even as he was shouting, Wellesley\u0027s right hand reached inside the coat under his cape and grasped the grip of his issue 9 mm Browning. This was his main chance. Keogh had attacked him, just as he\u0027d hoped he would. It was self-defence, that\u0027s all.\\n\\n Harry, taking no chances, had nocked his bow, snatched the auxiliary bolt from its clips under the tiller of his weapon and placed it in the breech. In a sort of slow-motion born of the speed of his own actions, he saw Wellesley\u0027s arm straightening and coming up into the firing position; but he couldn\u0027t believe the man would shoot him. Why? For what reason? Or perhaps Wellesley feared he was going to use the crossbow again. That must be it, yes. He dropped his weapon into the armchair\u0027s well and threw up his arms.\\n\\n But now Wellesley\u0027s aim was unwavering, his eyes glinting, his knuckle turning white in the trigger-guard of the automatic. And he actually grinned as he shouted: \u0027Keogh, you madman - no! - nor\\n\\n Then... three things, happening almost simultaneously:\\n\\n One: Darcy Clarke\u0027s voice, which Harry recognized immediately, shouting, \u0027Wellesley, get out of there. Get the fuck out of there!\u0027 And his footsteps coming clattering down the corridor, and his cursing as he collided with a plant-pot and stand and knocked them over.\\n\\n Two: Harry throwing himself over backwards behind the armchair as finally Wellesley\u0027s intention became clear, and hearing the angry whirrr of the bullet as the first shot went wide by an inch. And levering himself up to make a grab for the crossbow again, just in time to see the look on Wellesley\u0027s face turn from a mixture of incomprehensible rage and murderous intent to one of sheerest horror as his eyes were drawn to something behind Harry, which caused them to flash wide and disbelieving in a moment.\\n\\n Three: the crash of shattering glass and snapping of thin wooden mullions inwards as something wet and heavy and clumsy came plunging through the locked patio doors into the room, something which drew Wellesley\u0027s fire from Harry to itself!\\n\\n \u0027Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!\u0027 the head of E-Branch screamed, emptying his gun over Harry\u0027s head, which he\u0027d now turned towards the shattered glass door. And there, staggering from the impact of the shots but somehow managing to keep its feet, Harry saw something - indeed, someone, though who exactly it would be hard to tell -which he\u0027d thought never to see again. And even though he didn\u0027t know this one, still he knew him or it for a friend. For in the old days, all of the dead had been Harry\u0027s friends!\\n\\n This one was bloated, wet, intact, not long dead - but long enough to smell very badly. And behind it came a second corpse, dusty, withered, almost mummified, stepping through the frame of the shattered door. They were in their crumbling burial sheets and each of them carried a stone, advancing on Wellesley where he stood pinned to the wall, still yanking on the trigger of his empty gun.\\n\\n And Harry could only crouch there watching, mouthing silent denials, as they drew close to the frenzied, maddened boss of E-Branch and began to raise their stones.\\n\\n That was when the corridor light came on and Darcy Clarke stumbled into the room. His talent for survival -unfelt except by Darcy himself - was shrieking at him to get the hell out of here, almost physically driving him back. But somehow he fought it; and after all, the hostility of the dead wasn\u0027t directed at him but at his boss. \u0027Harry!\u0027 he yelled, when he saw what was happening in the room. \u0027For God\u0027s sake call them off!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 Harry yelled back. \u0027You know I can\u0027t!\u0027 But at least he could put himself between them. He did that now, jumped forward and somehow got between the dead things and Wellesley where he gibbered and frothed. And there they stood with their stones upraised, and the soggy one seeking to put Harry gently to one side.\\n\\n He might have, too, but suddenly suicidal, Harry cried out: \u0027No! Go back where you belong! It\u0027s a mistake!\u0027 Or at least he tried to. But he only got as far as \u0027go back where - \u0027 For he was forbidden to speak to the dead. But fortunately for Wellesley, the dead weren\u0027t forbidden to heed him.\\n\\n As Harry clapped his hands to his head and cried out, jerking like a spastic puppet as he crumpled up, so the dead men let fall their stones and turned away, and went out again into the night.\\n\\n Strangled until now, Wellesley found his voice again; but it was a deranged voice if ever Darcy Clarke heard one. \u0027Did you see? Did you see?\u0027 Wellesley gibbered. \u0027I didn\u0027t believe it, but now I\u0027ve seen for myself. He called them up against me! He\u0027s a monster, by God, a monster! But it\u0027s the end of you, Harry Keogh\u0027\\n\\n He\u0027d freed the spent magazine from his gun and dropped it to the carpeted floor, and was in the process of bringing a fully loaded one out of his pocket when Clarke hit him with all the force he could muster. Gun and magazine went flying, and Wellesley hung there in his makeup, suspended from the crossbow bolt.\\n\\n Then there were more running footsteps, and in the next moment the two-man back-up team was there wondering what the hell was going on; and Darcy was down on the floor with Harry, holding him in his arms as the agonized man clutched at his head and gasped out his unbearable pain, and slid down into the deep, dark well of merciful oblivion...\\n\\n A great deal occurred in the nine hours it took Harry to sleep it off. A security-screened doctor was called in to look at him, also to give Wellesley a shot that would keep him down a while; Clarke got in touch with Sandra because he reckoned she should be in on this, and should have been from the start; and as dawn came and went and both Harry and Wellesley were beginning to show signs of regaining consciousness, so a call came through from the Duty Officer at E-Branch HQ.\\n\\n Darcy had of course already put HQ in the picture. He\u0027d contacted the DO right after the excitement had died down to report everything that had happened and what he\u0027d done, and at the same time to tender his resignation to the Minister Responsible. Also he\u0027d suggested that someone might like to start thinking about a replacement for Wellesley, who was obviously several kinds of flake. And looking back on Wellesley\u0027s plan to scare Harry Keogh into using the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum -which he, Darcy Clarke, had gone along with - Darcy reckoned he might be just a little on the flaky side himself!\\n\\n Sandra, when she\u0027d arrived looking worried as hell and after he\u0027d explained things to her, had said as much in no uncertain terms and probably would have said a lot more, except she could see that Darcy was taking it badly enough already. She didn\u0027t feel the need to blame him because he was so obviously blaming himself; so instead of ranting and raving and generally going to pieces, she\u0027d simply sat with Harry through what was left of the night and into the morning. And just a few minutes ago, when everyone was into his third cup of coffee, that was when the telephone rang and it was HQ asking to speak to Darcy Clarke. He took the call, which was a long one, and when he was through had to sit down a minute and think about it.\\n\\n They\u0027d stretched Wellesley out on Harry\u0027s bed upstairs, with one of the men from E-Branch watching him; Harry himself had a leather couch downstairs in the study where everything had happened, and where they\u0027d draped a blanket over the broken patio doors to keep out the night chill; Sandra, Darcy and the other E-Branch operative were all there with him, with nothing to do now except wait for him to wake up.\\n\\n Except that now, following this telephone call, Darcy had quite a bit more to do, and the speed with which circumstances had changed had left him breathless. But Sandra had seen the full range of rapidly changing expressions on his face as he\u0027d talked into the telephone; and now, catching a glimpse of the confusion in his mind - and the relief, and something of the shock, too? - she felt prompted to inquire:\\n\\n \u0027What was that all about?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy looked at her and his bleary eyes slowly focussed. Then he turned to the other agent and said, \u0027Eddy, go up and keep Joe company, eh? And when Wellesley wakes up, tell him he\u0027s under arrest!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 the other looked at him incredulously.\\n\\n Darcy nodded. That was the DO on the blower, and he had our Minister right there with him. It seems our pal Norman Harold Wellesley has been fooling around a little with a suspicious character from the Russian Embassy! He\u0027s suspended forthwith, and we\u0027re to deliver him to MIS a.s.a.p. - which puts me right back in the chair. For now, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n As Eddy left to go upstairs, Darcy told Sandra: \u0027Yes, but that\u0027s just part of it. It never rains but it pours. We have a big problem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We?\u0027 she said, shaking her head. \u0027No, for I\u0027m out of it, whatever it is. And I thought you were, too. Well, your resignation may have been turned down, but not mine. I\u0027m through with the Branch, as of now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I understand that,\u0027 he said, \u0027and I meant I have a problem rather than we. It\u0027s not only business but personal, too. And I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t quit until it\u0027s sorted out. But you don\u0027t want to hear about it, right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hearing won\u0027t hurt,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s Ken Layard and Trevor Jordan,\u0027 he began to explain. \u0027They were out in the Aegean, Rhodes, keeping tabs on a load of drugs being run through the Med. And now it seems they\u0027ve come unstuck. Badly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How badly?\u0027 Sandra had met the two men - in fact Jordan, the telepath, had been her sponsor - and she knew something of their talents and outstanding reputations.\\n\\n \u0027Very badly,\u0027 Darcy shook his head. \u0027And... it\u0027s weird! Something I\u0027m going to have to look into myself. These were two of my closest friends.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Weird?\u0027 she repeated him. \u0027Were?\u0027\\n\\n He nodded. \u0027Over the last few days Trevor\u0027s had a couple of minor problems. They thought it was overeating or drinking or something. Now apparently he\u0027s a raving madman ... or would be if he wasn\u0027t under sedation in a Rhodes asylum! And the night before last - no, the one before that; when I\u0027m tired like this my body-clock goes out of whack - Ken Layard was fished out of the harbour half-full of water and with a bump on his head where he\u0027d collided with something. Concussion, that\u0027s all. Except as yet there\u0027s no sign of a normal recovery. All of which smells very fishy to me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Harry Keogh, fumbling the word out of a mouth that tasted highly toxic as he tried to sit up.\\n\\n They sprang to his side, Darcy supporting him and Sandra hugging his head. \u0027Are you all right, Harry?\u0027 she stroked his hair, kissed his forehead.\\n\\n He freed himself, licked his lips and said, \u0027Be a love and make me a cup of coffee.\u0027 And as she left the room he focussed on Darcy.\\n\\n \u0027Names,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Eh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You mentioned the names of some people,\u0027 Harry said again, seeming to find some difficulty in getting his tongue round the words. \u0027People I\u0027ve heard of, and met, in E-Branch.\u0027 He pulled a face. \u0027God, my mouth tastes vile!\u0027 And then, suddenly remembering, his eyes went wide. \u0027That idiot was trying to shoot me! And then -\u0027 Abruptly, he struggled upright, his eyes searching every corner of the room.\\n\\n \u0027All that was last night, Harry,\u0027 Darcy told him, knowing what he was looking for. \u0027And... they\u0027ve gone now. They went when you told them to.\u0027\\n\\n Some of the anxiety went out of Harry\u0027s face, replaced by the bitter look of a man betrayed. \u0027You were here,\u0027 he accused, \u0027with Wellesley.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy didn\u0027t deny it. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, \u0027I was, but for the last time. I was following orders, or trying to, but that\u0027s no excuse. I was here, and shouldn\u0027t have been. But from here on in ... I have one more job to do, and then I\u0027m out of E-Branch for good. I don\u0027t think spying\u0027s my style, Harry. And I sure as hell know that shitting on my friends isn\u0027t! As for Wellesley: I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll be much trouble from now on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Harry went deathly pale in a moment. \u0027Don\u0027t tell me they - ?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy shook his head. \u0027No, they didn\u0027t hurt him. You told them to go and they went. And then you folded up.\u0027\\n\\n Sandra was back with Harry\u0027s coffee. \u0027What\u0027s this about names?\u0027 she said. -\\n\\n Harry took a mouthful of hot coffee, gave his head a tentative shake and said, \u0027Ow! God, my head!\u0027\\n\\n She took pills from her bag and gave them to him. He accepted them and washed them down. And: \u0027Names, yes,\u0027 he said yet again. \u0027The names of people in E-Branch. You were talking about them as I came to?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy told him about Layard and Jordan, and as he talked so Harry\u0027s face grew drawn, even haggard. Finally, when Darcy was done, Harry glanced at Sandra. \u0027Well?\u0027\\n\\n She shrugged, looked mystified. \u0027What are you getting at, Harry?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell him about the stones,\u0027 Harry said, \u0027in the garden.\u0027\\n\\n And seeing his meaning at once, she gasped: \u0027Ken L! And T. Jor!\u0027\\n\\n Now it was Darcy\u0027s turn to look dumb. \u0027Do you want to let me in on it?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Harry stood up, swayed a little, then headed for the patio doors. He was still in his pyjamas. \u0027Be careful!\u0027 Darcy cautioned him. \u0027There\u0027s still a lot of glass there. We didn\u0027t do much of a job of tidying up, I\u0027m afraid.\u0027\\n\\n Harry avoided the glass and took down the blanket, and they followed him into the garden. In his bare feet he crossed the lawn, pointed to a fresh series of stones where they\u0027d been laid out on the grass. \u0027There,\u0027 he said. \"That\u0027s what they were doing when Wellesley jumped me - which, incidentally, you might like to try explaining sometime when you\u0027ve a week or two to spare!\u0027 This was directed at both of them.\\n\\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 Sandra was quick to protest, \u0027I had nothing to do with it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you do work for the Branch.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not any more,\u0027 she said. And then, because she was afraid of losing him, she let it all out in a breathless rush. \u0027Try to understand, Harry. At first you were just a job, but different from any other they ever gave me. Also, what I was doing was for your benefit; that\u0027s what they told me. But they didn\u0027t plan - and I didn\u0027t plan - on my falling in love with you. That just happened, and now they can stuff their job.\u0027\\n\\n Harry smiled in his wan way, then staggered a little. She at once caught him, held him up. \u0027You shouldn\u0027t even be on your feet! You look terrible, Harry!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m still a bit dizzy, that\u0027s all,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Anyway, what you were saying: I heard all that, too, when I was waking up. And what the hell, I think I\u0027ve always known that you were one of theirs. You and Old Man Bettley. So what? So was I, once. And let\u0027s face it, I can use all the help I can get, right?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy was still looking at the stones, his forehead creased in a frown. \u0027Does this mean what I think it means-?\u0027 he asked. They all looked at the incomplete word:\\n\\n RHODF\\n\\n \u0027Rhodes,\u0027 said Harry, nodding. \u0027They didn\u0027t have time to finish the E and the S, that\u0027s all. And now it all adds up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But to what?\u0027 Sandra and Darcy said together.\\n\\n Harry looked at them and made no attempt to hide his fear. \u0027To something I\u0027ve been praying wouldn\u0027t happen, and yet half-expecting ever since I returned from Star-side,\u0027 he said. Then he shivered and added, \u0027Let\u0027s get inside.\u0027 And for the moment that was all he would say about it...\\n\\n When Wellesley woke up and Darcy told him it looked like he was in big trouble, at first he was full of bluster. But then he had to face down Harry, too, and that was when he caved in. He knew how lucky he was that he wasn\u0027t a murderer, knew too that Harry hadn\u0027t let his dead friends kill him, even though he\u0027d had the right and couldn\u0027t have been blamed for it. What\u0027s more, he knew what it had cost Harry to call them off. And so he told everything, the whole story: how he\u0027d been recruited by Gregor Borowitz because of his negative talent (the fact that his mind couldn\u0027t be read), and how he\u0027d been a sleeper until they tried to activate him.\\n\\n Harry had been their chief interest - though doubtless they would have got around to the rest of E-Branch, too, when they were satisfied that he was no longer a player -and so Wellesley had been feeding them details of his progress. But when it had seemed that Harry might be on the verge of new things, then they\u0027d wanted rid of him. Harry, with his old powers returned to him, or maybe new talents they hadn\u0027t even heard of, would be just too dangerous.\\n\\n Then Darcy had given his men their orders, to take the ex-head of the Branch back to London and hand him over, and finally he\u0027d spent a long session on the telephone talking to the Minister Responsible. One subject had been Nikolai Zharov, Wellesley\u0027s Russian contact. He was still loose somewhere, and alas would stay loose for the time being. Diplomatically immune, they couldn\u0027t even pick him up. Eventually a protest would be made to the Soviet Embassy, requiring Zharov\u0027s expulsion for the usual \u0027activities inconsistent with...\u0027 etc.\\n\\n By the time Darcy was through, Harry had a lot more coffee inside him and a bite of brunch, and was looking more his usual self. Not doleful, Darcy thought, just sort of placid and not entirely with it. He reminded him of nothing so much as a powerful hand torch minus its batteries. Fully charged he could really shine, but right now there wasn\u0027t even a spark.\\n\\n Or maybe there was.\\n\\n \u0027When are you going to Rhodes?\u0027 Harry asked him.\\n\\n \u0027Now, as soon as I can get a flight out. I\u0027d be out of here right now but I wanted to be sure you were OK first. I reckoned I owed you that at least, and probably a lot more. But I want to arrange to get Trevor and Ken out of there, if they can be moved. Also, I have to see if I can discover what they came up against. Their Greek liaison man is still out there and might be able to help me on that.\u0027 He looked at Harry speculatively. \u0027And I had hopes that you might be able to help me, too, Harry, what with these... messages you\u0027ve been getting, and all.\u0027\\n\\n Harry nodded. \u0027I have my suspicions,\u0027 he said, \u0027but we\u0027d all better pray I\u0027m wrong! See, I know the dead wouldn\u0027t harm me; they wouldn\u0027t deliberately risk hurting me. And yet this thing is so important to them, or to me, that it\u0027s almost as if they\u0027ve been tempting me into conversation! But my son did a hell of a good job on me. I don\u0027t remember my dreams in any detail - not the ones which they send me, anyway - and I can\u0027t try to clarify them. And as for the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum... God, I can\u0027t add two and two without it comes out five!\u0027\\n\\n Darcy Clarke had personal experience of the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. Harry had taken him there once, taken him through it. From here, this very house, to E-Branch HQ in London over three hundred miles away. And that had been a trip Darcy would never forget and, he hoped, never repeat, all the days of his life. Even now, these years later, it was printed on his memory in vivid detail.\\n\\n There had been Darkness on the M\u0026ouml;bius Strip, the Primal Darkness itself, as it was before the universe began. A place of negativity, yes, where Darkness lay upon the face of the deep. And Darcy had thought that this could well be that region from which God had commanded, Let There Be Light, and caused the physical universe to split off from the metaphysical void.\\n\\n There had been no air, but neither had there been time, so that Darcy didn\u0027t need to breathe. And without time there was likewise no space; both of these essentials of a universe of matter had been absent. But Darcy hadn\u0027t ruptured and flown apart, because there\u0027d been nowhere to fly to!\\n\\n Harry had been Darcy\u0027s single anchor on Sanity and Being and Humanity; he couldn\u0027t see him for there was no light, but he could feel the pressure of his hand. And perhaps because Darcy was himself psychically endowed, he\u0027d felt he had some small understanding of the place. For instance: he knew it was real because he was here, and with Harry beside him he\u0027d known he need not fear it because his talent hadn\u0027t prevented him from coming here. And so, even in the confusion of his near-panic, he\u0027d been able to explore his feelings about it.\\n\\n Lacking space it was literally \u0027nowhere\u0027, but by the same token lacking time it was every-where and -when. It was core and boundary both, interior and exterior, where nothing ever changed except by force of will. But there was no will, except it was brought here by someone like Harry Keogh. Harry was only a man, and yet the things he could do through the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum were... Godlike? And what if God should come here?\\n\\n And again Darcy had thought of The God, who wrought a Great Change out of a formless void and willed a universe. And then the thought had also occurred: We aren\u0027t meant to be here. This isn\u0027t our place.\\n\\n \u0027I understand how you feel,\u0027 Harry had told him then, \u0027for I\u0027ve felt it, too. But don\u0027t be afraid. Just let it happen and accept it. Can\u0027t you feel the magic of it? Doesn\u0027t it thrill you to your soul?\u0027\\n\\n And Darcy had had to admit it thrilled him - but it scared him witless, too!\\n\\n Then, so as not to prolong it, Harry had taken him to the threshold of a future-time door. Looking out, they\u0027d seen a chaos of millions, no, billions, of threads of pure blue light etched against an eternity of black velvet, like an incredible meteor shower, except the tracks didn\u0027t dim but remained printed on the sky - indeed, printed on Time! And the most awesome thing was this: that two of these twining, twisting streamers of blue light had issued from Darcy and Harry themselves, extruding from them and racing away into the future -\\n\\n The blue life-threads of humanity, of all Mankind, spreading out and away through space and time... But then Harry had closed that door and opened another, a door on the past.\\n\\n The myriad neon life-threads had been there as before but this time, instead of expanding into a misted distance, they\u0027d contracted and narrowed down, targeting on a faraway, dazzling blue core of origin.\\n\\n And in the main, that was what had most seared itself on Darcy\u0027s memory: the fact that he\u0027d seen the very birthlight of Mankind...\\n\\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 Harry\u0027s voice, decisive now, brought him back to the present, \u0027I\u0027m coming with you^ To Rhodes, I mean. You might need my advice.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy gazed at him in astonishment. He hadn\u0027t seen or heard him so positive in ... how long? \u0027You\u0027re coming with - ?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re my friends, too,\u0027 Harry blurted. \u0027Oh, maybe I don\u0027t know them like you do, but I trusted in them once and they trusted in me, in what I was doing. They were in on that Bodescu business. They have their talents, and they have invaluable experience of ... things. Also, well it seems to me the dead want me to go. And lastly, we really can\u0027t afford to have anything happen to people like those two. Not now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We can\u0027t afford it? What \"we\", Harry?\u0027 And suddenly Darcy was very tense, waiting for Harry\u0027s answer.\\n\\n \u0027You, me, the world.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is it that bad?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It could be. So I\u0027m coming with you.\u0027\\n\\n Sandra looked at them both and said: \u0027So am I.\u0027\\n\\n Darcy shook his head. \u0027Not if it\u0027s like he thinks it might be, you\u0027re not.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I\u0027m a telepath!\u0027 she protested. \u0027I might be able to help with Trevor Jordan. He and I used to be able to read each other like books. He\u0027s my friend, too, remember?\u0027\\n\\n Harry took her arm. \u0027Didn\u0027t you hear what Darcy said? Trevor\u0027s a madman. His mind has gone.\u0027\\n\\n She pulled a face and tut-tutted. \u0027What does that mean, Harry? Minds don\u0027t just \"go\", you of all people should know that. It hasn\u0027t \"gone\" anywhere - just gone wrong, that\u0027s all. I might be able to look in there and see what\u0027s wrong.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re wasting time,\u0027 Darcy was growing anxious. \u0027OK, so it\u0027s decided: we\u0027re all three going. How long will it take you to get ready?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m ready,\u0027 Harry answered at once. \u0027Five minutes to pack a few things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll need to pick up my passport on our way through Edinburgh,\u0027 Sandra shrugged. \u0027That\u0027s all. Anything else I need I\u0027ll buy out there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 said Darcy. \u0027You phone a taxi, and I\u0027ll help Harry pack. If we have time I can always put HQ in the picture from the airport. So let\u0027s go.\u0027\\n\\n And in their graves the teeming dead relaxed a little -for the moment, anyway. Harry, because he thought he\u0027d heard their massed sighing, gave a small shudder. It wasn\u0027t terror or dread or anything like that. It was just the frisson of knowing. But of course his friends - his living friends - knew nothing at all of that.\\n\\n Unbeknown to the three, Nikolai Zharov was at Edinburgh Airport to see them off. He had also been across the river with a pair of KGB-issue nite-lite binoculars when Wellesley broke into Harry\u0027s house in Bonnyrig. And he\u0027d seen what had left the garden to plod back to their riven plots in a cemetery half a mile away. He\u0027d seen and known what they were, and still looked haggard from knowing it.\\n\\n But that didn\u0027t stop Zharov coding a message and phoning it through to the KGB cell at the embassy. So that in a very short time indeed the Soviet intelligence agencies knew that Harry Keogh was en route to the Mediterranean.\\n\\n It was 6:30 p.m. local time at Rhodes Airport when Manolis Papastamos met them off their flight; during the taxi ride into the historic town, he told them in his frenetic fashion all he knew of what had transpired. But seeing no connection, he made no mention of Jianni Lazarides.\\n\\n \u0027What of Ken Layard now?\u0027 Darcy wanted to know.\\n\\n Papastamos was small, slender, all sinew and suntan and shiny-black, wavy hair. Handsome in a fashion, and usually full of zest, now he looked harassed and hagridden. \u0027I don\u0027t know what it is,\u0027 he gave a series of questioning, desperate shrugs, held out his hands palms up. \u0027I don\u0027t know, and blame myself because I don\u0027t know! But... they are not easy to understand, those two. Policemen? Strange policemen! They seemed to know so much - to be so sure of certain things - but never explained to me how they knew.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re very special,\u0027 Darcy agreed. \u0027But what about Ken?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He couldn\u0027t swim, had a bump on his head. I dragged him out of the harbour onto some rocks, got the salt water out of him, went for help. Jordan was no use to me: he just sat on the mole under the old windmills babbling to himself. He was suddenly... crazy! And he\u0027s stayed that way. But Layard, he was OK, I swear it! Just a bump on the head. And now...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Now?\u0027 said Harry.\\n\\n \u0027Now they say he may die!\u0027 Papastamos looked like he might cry. \u0027I did all I could, I swear it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t blame yourself, Manolis,\u0027 Darcy told him. \u0027Whatever happened wasn\u0027t your fault. But can we see him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course, we go to the hospital now. You can see Trevor, too, if you wish it. But,\u0027 and again he shrugged, \u0027you won\u0027t get much out of that one. My God, I am so sorry!\u0027\\n\\n The hospital was off Papalouca, one of the New Town\u0027s main roads. It was a big, sprawling place with a frontage all of a hundred yards long. \u0027One section - a ward, clinic and dispensary - is reserved mainly for the treatment of the tourists,\u0027 Papastamos explained as their taxi took them in through the gates. \u0027It\u0027s not much in use now, but in July and August the work doesn\u0027t stop. The broken bones, bad sunburns, heatstroke, stings, cuts and bruises. Ken Layard has a room of his own.\u0027\\n\\n He told their driver to wait, led the way into a side wing where a receptionist sat in her booth clipping her fingernails. As soon as she saw Papastamos she sprang to her feet and spoke to him in breathless, very much subdued Greek. Papastamos at once gasped and went pale. \u0027My friends, you are too late,\u0027 he said. \u0027He is ... dead!\u0027 He looked at Sandra, Darcy and Harry in turn, and shook his head. \u0027There is nothing I can say.\u0027\\n\\n They were too dumbstruck to answer for a moment, until Harry said: \u0027Can we see him anyway?\u0027\\n\\n Harry looked cool in a pale blue jacket, white shirt and slacks. He and the others had slept on the plane, catching up on a lot of lost sleep. And despite his travails of the night before, he seemed to have come through it better than them. His face was calm, resigned; unlike Sandra\u0027s and Darcy\u0027s, Papastamos saw no sorrow in it. And the Greek thought: A cold-blooded one, this Harry Keogh.\\n\\n But he was wrong: it was simply that Harry had learned to view death differently. Ken Layard might be finished \u0027here\u0027 - finished physically, materially, in the corporeal world - but he wasn\u0027t all dead. Not all of him. Why, for all Harry knew Ken might be seeking him out right now, desperate to engage him in deadspeak. Except Harry was forbidden to hear him, and forbidden to answer even if he did.\\n\\n \u0027See him?\u0027 Papastamos answered. \u0027Of course you can. But the girl tells me that first the doctor wishes to see us. His office is this way.\u0027 And he led them down a cool corridor where the light came slanting in through high, narrow windows.\\n\\n They found the doctor, a small bald man with thick-lensed spectacles perched on the end of his hook of a nose, in his tiny office room signing and stamping papers.\\n\\n When Papastamos introduced them to him, Dr Sakellarakis was at once the soul of concern, displaying his very genuine dismay at the loss of their friend. Speaking half-decent English and shaking his head sadly, he told them:\\n\\n \"This bump on the Layard\u0027s head - I \u0027fraid is much more than the simple bump, gentlemen, lady. There is perhaps the damage inside? This is not certain until the autopsy, naturally, but I thinks this one is causing the death. The damage, the blood clot, something.\u0027 Again he shook his head, gave a sad shrug.\\n\\n \u0027Can we see him?\u0027 Harry asked again. And as the doctor led the way: \u0027When is the autopsy?\u0027\\n\\n Again the Greek\u0027s shrug. \u0027One days, two - as soon as it can be arranged. But soon. Until then I am having him removed to the morgue.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And when did he die - exactly?\u0027 Harry was relentless.\\n\\n \u0027Exactly? To the minute? Is not known. One hour, I thinks. About... ah, 1800 hours?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Six o\u0027clock local time,\u0027 said Sandra. \u0027We were on the plane.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Does there have to be an autopsy?\u0027 Harry hated the thought of it; he knew the effect necromancy had on the dead, how much they feared it. Dragosani had been a necromancer, and oh how the dead had loathed and feared him! Of course, this wouldn\u0027t be the same; Layard would feel nothing at the hands of a pathologist, whose skills would be those of the surgeon as opposed to the torturer, but still Harry didn\u0027t like it.\\n\\n Sakellarakis held up his hands. \u0027It is the law.\u0027\\n\\n Layard\u0027s room was small, white, clean and pungently antiseptic. He lay full length on a trolley, covered head to toe by a sheet. The bed he\u0027d used had been made up again, and the window closed to keep out flies. Darcy carefully laid back the sheet to show Layard\u0027s face �C and drew back at once, wincing. Sandra, too. Layard\u0027s face wasn\u0027t in repose.\\n\\n \u0027Is the spasm,\u0027 Sakellarakis informed, nodding. \u0027The muscles, a contraction. The mortician is putting this one right. Then Layard, he is doing the correct sleeping.\u0027\\n\\n Harry hadn\u0027t drawn back. Instead he stood over Layard, looking down at him. The esper was grey, clay-cold, frozen in rigor mortis. But his face was fixed in something rather more than that. His jaws were open in a scream and his upper lip at the left had lifted up and away from the teeth, leaving them visible and shining. His entire face seemed pulled to the left in a sort of rictus, as if he screamed his denial of something unbelievable, unbearable.\\n\\n His eyes were closed, but in the eyelids under the brows Harry saw twin slits in the membranous skin. They were fine but dark and plainly visible against the overall pallor. \u0027He\u0027s been... cut?\u0027 Harry glanced at the Greek doctor.\\n\\n The spasm,\u0027 the other nodded. \"The eyes come open. It can happen. I make the small cuts in the muscles... no problem.\u0027\\n\\n Harry licked his lips, frowned, peered intently at the large blue lump showing on Layard\u0027s forehead and continuing into his hair. The shiny skin was broken in the centre, a small abrasion where flesh white as fishbelly showed through. Harry looked at the lump, reached out a hand as if to touch it, then turned away. And: \u0027That look on his face,\u0027 he said, under his breath. \u0027No muscular spasm that, but sheer terror!\u0027\\n\\n Darcy Clarke, for his part, had taken one look at Layard and drawn back first one pace, then another. But he hadn\u0027t stopped drawing back and was now out in the corridor. His face was drawn, eyes staring into the room at the figure on the trolley. Sandra joined him; Harry, too.\\n\\n \u0027Darcy, what is it?\u0027 Sandra\u0027s voice was hushed.\\n\\n Darcy only shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he gulped. \u0027But whatever it is, it\u0027s not right!\u0027 It was his talent working, looking out for him.\\n\\n Papastamos put back the sheet over Layard\u0027s face; he and Sakellarakis came out of the room into the corridor. \u0027Not the spasm, you say?\u0027 The doctor looked at Harry and cocked his head on one side. \u0027You are knowing about these things?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know some things about the dead, yes,\u0027 Harry nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Harry\u0027s ... an expert,\u0027 Darcy had himself under control now.\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Sakellarakis. \u0027A doctor!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 Harry took him by the arm, spoke earnestly to him. \u0027The autopsy must be tonight. And then he must be burned!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Burned? You are meaning cremated?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, cremated. Reduced to ashes. Tomorrow at the latest.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My God!\u0027 Manolis Papastamos burst out. \u0027And Ken Layard was your friend? Such friends I don\u0027t need! I thought you were the cold one but... you are not merely cold, you are as dead as he is!\u0027\\n\\n Cold sweat was beading Harry\u0027s forehead now and he was beginning to look sick. \u0027But that\u0027s just the point,\u0027 he said. \u0027I don\u0027t think he is dead!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t - ?\u0027 Dr Sakellarakis\u0027s jaw fell open. \u0027But I know this thing for sure! The gentleman, he is certain dead!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Undead!\u0027 Harry was swaying now.\\n\\n Sandra\u0027s eyes flew wide. So this was really it. But Harry had been caught off guard; he was shocked, saying too much. \u0027It\u0027s ... an English expression!\u0027 she quickly cut in. \u0027Undead: not dead but merely departed. Old friends simply... pass on. That\u0027s what he meant. Ken\u0027s not dead but in the hands of God.\u0027\\n\\n Or the devil! Harry thought. But he was steadier now and glad that she\u0027d come to his rescue.\\n\\n Darcy\u0027s mind was also working overtime. \u0027It\u0027s Layard\u0027s religion,\u0027 he said, \u0027which requires that he\u0027s burned -cremated - within a day of his dying. Harry only wants to be sure it will be the way he would want it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 Manolis Papastamos still wasn\u0027t sure, but he thought that at least he was beginning to understand. Then I have to apologize. I am sorry, Harry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s OK,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027Can we see Trevor Jordan now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll go right now,\u0027 Papastamos nodded. \"The asylum is in the Old Town, inside the old Crusader walls. It\u0027s off Pythagoras Street. The nuns run it.\u0027\\n\\n They used the taxi again and reached their destination in a little over twenty minutes. By now the sun was setting and a cool breeze off the sea brought relief from the heat of the day. During the journey Darcy asked Papastamos: \u0027Incidentally, can you fix us up with somewhere to stay? A decent hotel?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Better than that,\u0027 said the other. \u0027The tourist season is just starting; many of the villas are still empty; I found you a place as soon as I knew you were coming. After you have seen poor Trevor, then I take you there.\u0027\\n\\n At the asylum they had to wait until a Sister of Rhodos could be spared from her duties to take them to Jordan\u0027s cell. He was strait jacketed, seated in a deep, high-sided leather chair with his feet inches off the ground. In this position he could do himself no harm, but in any case he seemed asleep. With Papastamos to translate, the Sister explained that they were administering a mild sedative at regular intervals. It wasn\u0027t that Jordan was violent, more that he seemed desperately afraid of something.\\n\\n \u0027Tell her she can leave us with him,\u0027 Harry told the Greek. \u0027We won\u0027t stay long, and we know the way out.\u0027 And when Papastamos had complied and the Sister left: \u0027And you, too, Manolis, if you please.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eh?\u0027\\n\\n Darcy laid a hand on his arm. \u0027Be a good fellow, Manolis, and wait for us outside,\u0027 he told him. \u0027Believe me, we know what we\u0027re doing.\u0027\\n\\n The other shrugged, however sourly, and left.\\n\\n Darcy and Harry looked at Sandra. \u0027Do you feel up to it?\u0027 Darcy said.\\n\\n She was nervous, but: \u0027It should be easy,\u0027 she answered at last. \u0027We\u0027re two of a kind. I\u0027ve had plenty of practice with Trevor and know the way in.\u0027 But it was as if she spoke more to convince herself than anyone else. And as she took up a position behind Jordan, with her hands on the back of his chair, so the last rays of the sun began to fade in the tiny, high, recessed stained-glass windows of the cell.\\n\\n Sandra closed her eyes and the silence grew. Jordan sat locked in his chair; his chest rising and falling, his eyelids fluttering as he dreamed or thought whatever thoughts they were that troubled him; his left hand fluttering a little, too, where it was strapped down by his thigh. Harry and Darcy stood watching, aware now of the gathering dusk, the fading light...\\n\\n And without warning Sandra was in!\\n\\n She looked, saw, gave a strangled little cry and stumbled back away from Jordan\u0027s chair until she crashed into the wall. Jordan\u0027s eyes snapped open. They were terrified! His head swivelled left and right and he saw the two espers standing before him - and just for a moment, he knew them!\\n\\n \u0027Darcy! Harry!\u0027 he croaked.\\n\\n And as simply and suddenly as that Harry knew who had come to him in his dreams at Bonnyrig to beg his help!\\n\\n But in the next moment Jordan\u0027s white face began to twitch and shake in dreadful spasms of effort and agony. He tried to say something butwas denied the chance. The shuddering stopped, his fevered eyes closed and his head lolled, and he slumped down again. But even as he returned to his monstrous dreams, so he managed one last word:\\n\\n \u0027Ha-Ha-Haarrryr\\n\\n They rushed to Sandra where she stood half-fainting against the wall. And when she stopped gasping for air and was able to hold them off:\\n\\n \u0027What was it?\u0027 Harry asked her. \u0027Did you see?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I saw,\u0027 she nodded, swallowing rapidly. \u0027He\u0027s not mad, Harry, just trapped.\u0027\\n\\n Trapped?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In his own mind, yes. Like some innocent, cringing, terrified victim locked in a dungeon.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A victim of what?\u0027 Darcy wanted to know, slack-jawed as he gaped at her trembling in Harry\u0027s arms.\\n\\n \u0027Oh God! Oh God!\u0027 she whispered, her trembling threatening to shake Harry, too, as her eyes went fearfully back to Trevor Jordan lolling there unconscious in his chair. And Darcy felt his blood stiffen to ice in the haunted light of her eyes, as finally she answered: \u0027Of the monster who\u0027s in there with him! Of that Thing who\u0027s in there right now, talking to him, questioning him... about us!\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iv-deadspeak-necroscope-4/page-7.html","bookId":2437,"book":{"id":2437,"title":"Necroscope IV: Deadspeak (Necroscope #4)","description":"Storyline: Several years after his return to earth Harry Sr. is trouble by nightmares of resurgent Vampires.
