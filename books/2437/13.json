{"id":78838,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"13\n First Contact - the Challenge - Thralls\n Before he went to sleep, Harry tried again to contact M\u0026ouml;bius. It was useless; his deadspeak went out to M\u0026ouml;bius\u0027s grave in Leipzig, but no one answered. One of the reasons Harry had delayed pursuing Janos was that he\u0027d hoped (hope against hope) to regain his numeracy - and through it access to the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. This had been his plan but ... it was fading now, possibly into oblivion.\n Still worrying about it, eventually he slept.\n But his obsession of the moment was carried over into his dreams where, separated from the lesser problems and diversions of the waking world, Harry continued to transmit his thoughts across that Great Dark Gulf which men called Death. Many of the teeming dead in their graves heard him, would answer or comfort him, but dared not. None of them was the one he sought; communication for its own sake would be pointless; they knew that their commiserations, even their inevitable approbations, would only constitute obstructions in Harry\u0027s path. For the Necroscope had never been able to refuse conversation with the dead, whose suffering of solitude he alone of all living men understood.\n There was one among the dead, however, who - for all that she loved him more than the rest - stood much less in awe of him. Indeed, on a good many occasions she had chided him. The mothers of men are like that.\n Harry? her deadspeak touched him. Can you hear me, son?\n He sighed and abandoned his search for M\u0026ouml;bius. There had been that in her tone which commanded his attention. What is it, Ma?\n What is it? (He could picture her frown.) Is that how you speak to me, Harry?\n Ma, he sighed again, and tried to explain, I\u0027ve been busy. And what I\u0027m doing is important. You don\u0027t know how important.\n Do you think so? she answered. Do you really think I don\u0027t know? But who knows you better than me, Harry? Well, I know this much, anyway - that you\u0027re wasting your time!\n Harry\u0027s dreaming mind played with her words and found no explanation for them. Nor would he unless she was willing to supply one. She picked that up at once and flew at him in the closest she\u0027d ever come to a rage. What!? And would you take that attitude? Would you take your impatience out on me? Well, the dead might prize you, but they don\u0027t know you like I do. And Harry, you... are ... a ... trouble!\n Ma,I -\n You, you, you! Always you! And are you the only one? Who is this T you\u0027re always mentioning, Harry? And why is it you never speak of \u0027we\u0027? Why must you always think you\u0027re alone? Of all men you are not alone! For a million years men have died and lain silent in the dark, thinking their thoughts and following their solitary designs, each separate from the next but joined in the belief that death was an airless, lightless (oh, yes, and painless too!) but relentless prison... until a small bright light named Harry Keogh came along and said: \u0027Why don\u0027t you talk to me? I\u0027ll listen. And then you might like to try talking to each other!\u0027 Ahhh! A revelation!\n Harry remained silent, didn\u0027t know how to answer. Was she praising or chastising him? He had never heard her like this, not even when he was awake. She had never been so angry. And his Ma picked that up, too.\n Why am I angry? I don\u0027t believe it! For years you couldn\u0027t speak to me if you wanted to - not without killing yourself for it and finally when you can speak to me -\n Now he believed he understood, and knew that she was right, and hoped he also knew how to deal with it. Ma, he said, the others need to know about me, need to be reassured that there\u0027s more than just loneliness in death. And they need to know that there\u0027s safety in it, too. From such as Dragosani and the Ferenczys, and others of their sort. But there are so many of the dead - I have so many good friends amongst them - that I can\u0027t ever hope to speak to them all. Not until I\u0027m one of them, anyway. But you don\u0027t need to know these things because you already know! Yes, and you\u0027ve always known... that I love you, too, Ma. She was silent.\n So if there\u0027s ever a time I don\u0027t contact you, it\u0027s because something very, very important is getting in the way. And Ma, that\u0027s the way it\u0027s always going to be... Ma?\n She was full to the top, which was why she wasn\u0027t answering, but at least she wasn\u0027t crying. Harry hoped not, anyway. And eventually she said: Oh, I know that, son. It\u0027s just that I... I worry about you so. And the dead... they ask after you. Yes, and because they love you they go out of their way for you, too. Don\u0027t you know that? Can\u0027t you understand that we all want to help?-And don\u0027t you know that there are experts among us - in every field - whose talents you\u0027re wasting?\n What? Wasted talents? The dead wanted to help him?\n But didn\u0027t they always? What had she been up to? What\u0027s that, Ma? he said. About the dead? And what did you mean: I\u0027m wasting my time?\n In trying to contact M\u0026ouml;bius, that\u0027s what I mean, she immediately answered. If only you\u0027d stay in touch you\u0027d know! Why, we\u0027ve been trying to get hold of M\u0026ouml;bius for you ever since you got your deadspeak back!\n You what? But... how? M\u0026ouml;bius isn\u0027t here. He\u0027s out there somewhere. He could be anywhere. Literally anywhere!\n We know that, she answered, and also that anywhere\u0027s a big place. We haven\u0027t found him yet. But if and when we do he\u0027ll get your message and, we hope, get back to you. Meanwhile you needn\u0027t concern yourself about it. You can get on with other things.\n Ma, said Harry, you don\u0027t understand. Listen: M\u0026ouml;bius is probably in the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. The dead-even the massed thoughts of all the dead - couldn\u0027t possibly reach him there. It\u0027s a place that isn\u0027t of this universe. So you see it\u0027s not so much that I\u0027m wasting my time, but that you are wasting yours!\n He could sense her shaking her head. And: Son, she said, when Harry Jnr took away your deadspeak and your mathematical intuition, did he also addle your brains?\n Eh?\n When you use the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum, how much time do you actually spend in it?\n And he at once saw that she was right, and wondered: is logic linked with numeracy in the human mind? Has my son diluted my powers of reason, too? No time, he said. It\u0027s instantaneous. M\u0026ouml;bius wasn\u0027t in the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum - he merely used it to get wherever he was going.\n Exactly. So why waste your time aiming deadspeak thoughts at his grave in Leipzig, eh? It\u0027s like you said: he\u0027s out there somewhere. An astronomer in life, death hasn\u0027t changed him. So right now there are an awful lot of us directing our thoughts outwards to the stars! And if he\u0027s there we\u0027ll find him, eventually.\n Harry had to give in to her. Ma, what would I do without you?\n I was only putting you straight, Harry. Telling you that between times you should get on with other things.\n Such as?\n Harry, you have access to the most extensive library in the world, books which not only hold knowledge but can also impart it. The minds of the dead are like books for you to read, and their talents are all there to be learned. Just as you learned from M\u0026ouml;bius, so you can learn from the rest of us.\n But that was something Harry had long ago considered, and long since turned down. Dragosani had learned from the dead, too. Thibor Ferenczy had instructed him - in evil. Likewise, as a necromancer, Dragosani had stolen the talents of Max Batu, and the secrets of the Soviet E-Branch from Gregor Borowitz. And yet none of these things had helped him in the end. Indeed, Batu\u0027s evil eye had assisted in his destruction! No, there were certain things, like the future, which Harry preferred not to know. And these thoughts of his were deadspeak, which of course his mother read at once.\n Maybe you\u0027re right, she said, but still you should keep it in mind. There are talents here, Harry, and if and when you need them they\u0027re yours for the asking...\n Her voice was fading now, dwindling away into dreams. But at least this time Harry would remember their conversation. And at last, weary now in mind and body both, he relaxed, let go, sank down even deeper into dream and lay suspended there, simply sleeping. For a little while. Until -\n Haaarry? It was M\u0026ouml;bius! Harry would know his dead-speak anywhere. But even by dreaming standards Mobius\u0027s voice was... dreamy. For this was a very different M\u0026ouml;bius, a changed M\u0026ouml;bius.\n August Ferdinand? Is that you? I\u0027ve been looking for you. I mean, a great many of us have been searching for you everywhere.\n I know, Harry. I was... out there. But you were right and they were wrong. I was in the Continuum! For as long as I could bear it, anyway. The thoughts of your dead friends reached me as I emerged.\n Harry didn\u0027t understand. What\u0027s to bear? he asked. The M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum is what it is.\n Is it? M\u0026ouml;bius\u0027s voice was still mazed and wandering, like that of a sleepwalker, or a man in some sort of trance. Is it, Harry? Or is it much more than it appears to be? But... it\u0027s strange, my boy, so strange. I would have talked to you about it - I wanted to - but you\u0027ve been away so long, Haaarry.\n That wasn\u0027t my fault, Harry told him. I couldn\u0027t keep in touch, wasn\u0027t able to. Something had happened to me - to my deadspeak - and I was cut off from everyone. And that\u0027s one of the reasons why I had to contact you now. You see, it\u0027s not just that I\u0027d lost my deadspeak, but also my ability to use the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. And I need it like I never needed it before.\n The Continuum? Need it? Still M\u0026ouml;bius wasn\u0027t entirely himself, far from it. Oh, we all need it, Harry. Indeed, without it there\u0027s nothing! It is EVERYTHING! And... and... and I\u0027m sorry, Harry, but I have to go back there.\n That\u0027s all right, Harry desperately answered, feeling M\u0026ouml;bius\u0027s deadspeak sliding off at a tangent. And I swear I wouldn\u0027t be troubling you if it wasn\u0027t absolutely necessary, but-\n It... it talks to me! M\u0026ouml;bius\u0027s voice was an awestruck whisper, drifting, fading as his attention transferred itself elsewhere. And I think I know what it is. The only thing it can be. I have... to ... go... now... Haaarry.\n Another moment and he had gone, disappeared, and not even an echo remaining. So that Harry knew M\u0026ouml;bius had returned to the one place above all others which was now forbidden to him. Into the M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum.\n Finally Harry was left alone to sleep out a night which, for all that it was dreamless, was nevertheless uneasy...\n The next morning, on their way in Manolis\u0027s car to see Trevor Jordan, something which had been bothering Harry suddenly surfaced. \u0027Manolis,\u0027 he said, \u0027I\u0027m an idiot! I should have thought of it before.\u0027\n The Greek glanced at him. \u0027Thought of what, Harry?\u0027\n \u0027The KGB knew I was going to Romania. They knew it almost before I did. I mean, they were waiting for me when I landed - goons of theirs, anyway. So, someone must have told them. Someone here on Rhodes!\u0027\n For a moment Manolis looked blank, but then he grinned and slapped his thigh. \u0027Harry,\u0027 he said, \u0027you are the very strange person with the extremely weird powers - but I think you will never make the policeman! Yesterday, when you told us your story, I thought it was understood that I must arrive at this selfsame conclusion. And of course I did. My next step was to ask myself who knew you were going other than your immediate circle? Answer: no one - except the booking clerk at the airport itself! The local police are looking into it right now. If there is an answer, they will find it.\u0027\n \u0027Good!\u0027 said Harry. \u0027But the point I\u0027m making is this: the last thing I want is that someone should be waiting for me in Hungary, too. I mean, if it works out that I must go there.\u0027\n Manolis nodded. \u0027I understand your concern. Let\u0027s just hope the local boys turn something up.\u0027\n Neither Manolis, Harry, nor Darcy had any way of knowing that at that very moment the police were at the airport, talking to a man who worked on the passenger information desk; to him and to his brother, against whom they\u0027d long entertained certain grudges and suspicions of their own. Talking to them, and not much caring for the answers they were getting, but sure that eventually they\u0027d get the right ones.\n At the asylum a Sister met the three and took them to Jordan\u0027s room. He had a room now as opposed to a cell: a small place with high, barred windows, and a door with a peephole. The door was locked from the outside; obviously the doctors were still a little wary. The Sister looked through the peephole and smiled, and beckoned Harry forward. He followed her example and looked into the room. Jordan was striding to and fro in the confined space, his hands clasped behind his back. Harry knocked and the other at once stopped pacing and looked up. His face was alive now, alert and expectant.\n \u0027Harry?\u0027 he called out. \u0027Is that you?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, it is,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027Just give us a moment.\u0027\n The Sister unlocked the door and the three went in. She waited outside.\n Inside, Jordan took Darcy\u0027s hand and shook it; he slapped Manolis on the back, then stood stock still and slowly smiled Harry a greeting. \u0027So,\u0027 he said, \u0027and we have the Necroscope back on our team, eh?\u0027\n \u0027For a while,\u0027 Harry answered, returning his smile. And: \u0027You scared us, Trevor. We thought he\u0027d wrecked your mind.\u0027\n Darcy Clarke, after the initial handshake, had backed off a little, but unobtrusively. Now he mumbled: \u0027Will you excuse me a moment?\u0027 He went back out into the corridor, with Manolis following quickly on behind. In the corridor Darcy was standing beside the Sister - or rather, he was leaning against the wall. And his face was white!\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 Manolis hissed. \u0027I\u0027ve seen that look on your face before.\u0027\n \u0027Call Harry out of there,\u0027 Darcy whispered. \u0027Quickly!\u0027\n The Sister was beginning to look alarmed but Darcy cautioned her with a ringer to his lips.\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 Manolis\u0027s voice was casual as he leaned back into the room. \u0027Would you come out here a moment?\u0027\n \u0027Do you mind?\u0027 Harry lifted an eyebrow, glanced at Jordan.\n \u0027Not at all,\u0027 the other shook his head and smiled strangely, knowingly. Harry went out to the others.\n \u0027What is it?\u0027\n Darcy closed the door and turned the key. He looked at Harry and his Adam\u0027s apple was working. \u0027It\u0027s all wrong!\u0027 he said. \u0027There\u0027s something ... not right with him. In fact nothing\u0027s right with him!\u0027\n Harry\u0027s soulful eyes studied his drawn, trembling face. \u0027Your talent?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. That doesn\u0027t feel like Trevor. It looks like him, but it doesn\u0027t feel like him. Not to my guardian angel. My talent wouldn\u0027t let me stay in there.\u0027\n \u0027Harry?\u0027 came Jordan\u0027s voice from beyond the door. \u0027What\u0027s the delay? Look, I have something to tell you -but only you. Can\u0027t we talk, you and I, face to face?\u0027\n Manolis was quick off the mark. He showed the Sister his police identification, again warned her to silence as Darcy had done, with a finger to his lips, took out his Beretta and gave that to Harry. And: \u0027Leave the door ajar behind you, and we\u0027ll stay right here,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027But,\u0027 said Darcy, his voice wobbly, \u0027will that stop him?\u0027 He indicated the gun in Harry\u0027s hand.\n Harry nodded. \u0027He\u0027s not a vampire,\u0027 he said. He put the gun into an inside pocket of his jacket, unlocked the door and went through it. Inside the room Jordan had sat down in an armchair. There was another chair facing him and he beckoned Harry to take it. Harry sat down... but carefully, warily, never taking his eyes off the man opposite. \u0027Well,\u0027 he finally said, \u0027and here I am. So what\u0027s the big mystery, Trevor?\u0027\n \u0027All of a sudden,\u0027 said the other, still smiling his weird, knowing smile, \u0027you\u0027re not so concerned about me.\u0027 And Harry noticed how he formed his words slowly, carefully, making sure he got them right.\n Right there and then the Necroscope guessed what Jordan\u0027s trouble was and decided to put it to the test. \u0027Oh, I\u0027m concerned about you, all right,\u0027 he forced a smile onto his face. \u0027In fact you wouldn\u0027t believe just how concerned I am! Trevor, do you remember what you people at E-Branch used to call Harry Jnr when you looked after him that time?\u0027\n The strange, almost insinuating expression slid from Jordan\u0027s face. His features went slack and gaunt, his eyes blank, but just for a moment or two. Then... animation returned and he said: \u0027Oh, of course. The Boss, that\u0027s what we called him!\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right - \u0027 Harry nodded, and reached for the gun in his pocket, \u0027 - but you were much too slow in remembering. And you were the one who was always especially fond of him. It\u0027s not something you\u0027d need time to think about - or enquire about? - if you were you!\u0027\n As his gun started to come into view, so Jordan moved. Previously the man\u0027s movements had seemed slow to match his speech... but so are the movements of a chameleon before its tongue flickers into deadly life. And Janos\u0027s grip was strong on Jordan\u0027s mind. He moved like lightning, his left hand grabbing Harry\u0027s throat and his right bearing down on his gun hand, ramming it back inside his jacket. The Necroscope\u0027s reflexes took over. As Jordan straightened up from his chair, Harry kicked him hard between the legs... useless, for the mind which controlled Jordan\u0027s body simply turned the pain aside. In return, Jordan released Harry\u0027s throat and back-handed him with a clenched fist hard as iron! Before his eyes could focus from that, Jordan had lifted him half out of his chair and tried to butt him in the face. In the last moment Harry saw it coming and managed to turn his face aside, but even so the crushing hammer force of the man\u0027s head against his temple dazed and shook him. Before he could recover, Jordan let him fall back into his chair and dragged his gun hand into view. Then -\n The door burst open and Manolis hurled himself into the room. Darcy was right behind him, defying his leery talent\u0027s every effort to turn him back. Grunting his frustration, Jordan tried one last time, without effect, to wrench Harry\u0027s gun out of his hand before Manolis hit him. And the compact Greek policeman knew exactly how to hit. He shouldered Jordan back from Harry, drop-kicked him and knocked him down, then scrabbled his hands out from under him where he tried to push himself to his feet.\n Then Harry was between them, pointing his gun directly at Jordan\u0027s forehead. \u0027Don\u0027t make me!\u0027 he shouted at the possessed man, his words sharp as gravel chips. Jordan sat up and snarled at him, at all three of them.\n \u0027I was not the one to threaten!\u0027 he growled, his voice no longer that of the Jordan they had known. \u0027You threatened me!\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 Harry answered, \u0027you haven\u0027t threatened me personally, not yet, but you would sooner or later... Janos Ferenczy!\u0027 He made motions with his gun, indicating that the other should stand up.\n Janos, in Jordan\u0027s body, did so, and stood glowering at the three who ringed him in. And: \u0027Well then, Harry Keogh,\u0027 he finally grunted, \u0027and so you know me now. Very well, all subterfuge aside, we meet at last. But I wanted to know you, and I wanted you to know something of my power. You see how easily I have occupied this mind? Telepathy? Hah! Trevor Jordan was the veriest amateur!\u0027\n \u0027Your powers don\u0027t impress me,\u0027 Harry lied. \u0027The stench from a dead pig is likewise strong!\u0027\n \u0027You... you dare!\u0027 the other took a pace forward.\n Harry gritted his teeth and carefully aimed the gun right between Jordan\u0027s eyes -\n - And smiling crookedly, the possessed man came to a grudging halt. Then ... he staggered.\n Harry narrowed his eyes. \u0027What...?\u0027\n \u0027I ... I have pushed this weakling\u0027s flabby body too far,\u0027 Janos Ferenczy grunted from Jordan\u0027s throat. \u0027Allow me to sit down.\u0027\n \u0027Sit,\u0027 Harry told him. And as the other flopped into his chair, and sat there reeling, the Necroscope once more seated himself opposite. \u0027Now out with it, Janos,\u0027 he said. \u0027Why did you want to see me? To kill me?\u0027\n \u0027Kill you?\u0027 Janos laughed a baying laugh. \u0027If I were so desperate to have you dead, believe me you would be dead! But no, I want you alive!\u0027\n \u0027Wait!\u0027 Manolis came closer. \u0027Harry, are you saying that this is Janos Ferenczy? Is this really the Vrykoulakas?\u0027\n Janos! Jordan scowled at him. \u0027Greek, you are a fool!\u0027\n Manolis moved closer still, but Darcy took his arm. \u0027It\u0027s his mind,\u0027 he said, \u0027his telepathy, controlling Trevor\u0027s body.\u0027\n \u0027Kill him now!\u0027 Manolis said at once.\n \u0027That\u0027s just it,\u0027 Harry answered. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t be killing him but poor Jordan.\u0027\n Janos laughed again. \u0027You are helpless,\u0027 he said. \u0027Why, I could walk out of here! You are like small children!\u0027 Then he stopped laughing and scowled at Harry. \u0027And so you are the all-powerful Necroscope, eh? The man who talks to the dead, the famous vampire-killer. Well, I think you are nothing!\u0027\n \u0027Do you?\u0027 said Harry. \u0027And is that why you\u0027re here, to tell me that? Fine, so you\u0027ve told me. Now scurry off back to your Carpathian castle and get your filthy leech\u0027s mind out of my friend\u0027s head!\u0027\n The eyes in Jordan\u0027s head glared until they seemed about to leap from their orbits, and his hands trembled where they gripped the arms of the chair. But finally: \u0027It ... will ... be ... my ... my great pleasure to meet you again, Harry Keogh,\u0027 he said, grinding his teeth. \u0027But man to man, face to face.\u0027\n Harry was practised in the ways of the Wamphyri. He knew how to hurl weighty insults. \u0027Man to man?\u0027 he gave a snort of derision. \u0027You elevate yourself to ridiculous heights, Janos. And face to face? Why, there are cockroaches in this world who stand taller than you!\u0027\n Manolis got down on one knee beside Harry\u0027s chair, reached for his gun. \u0027Give it to me,\u0027 he said, \u0027and tell me what you want to know. And believe me, I will make him tell you!\u0027\n \u0027I go now - \u0027 Janos said, \u0027 - but I go knowing that you will come to me.\u0027 He opened his mouth and laughed, and wriggled his tongue as frantically and obscenely as a madman. \u0027I know it as surely as I know that tonight - ah tonight. - sweet Sandra will writhe in my bed, lathered with the froth of our fornication!\u0027\n He laughed, a great shout of a laugh, and fell limp in his chair. His eyes closed, his head leaned to one side and his jaw fell open. Foam dribbled from one corner of his mouth, and his left arm and hand vibrated a little where they hung down the side of the chair.\n Harry, Darcy and Manolis glanced at each other, and at last Harry half-released the Beretta into Manolis\u0027s hands - at which Jordan\u0027s eyes sprang open! He laughed again and leaped alert, and snatched the gun from between them. And: \u0027Ah, hah-hah!\u0027 he screamed. \u0027Children, mere children.\u0027\n And putting the gun to his right ear, he pulled the trigger.\n Harry had drawn back, forcing his chair backwards away from the action, but Darcy and Manolis were sprayed with blood and brains as the left side of Jordan\u0027s head flew apart. Yelping their horror, they started upright and back.\n Framed in the open doorway, a trio of Sisters of Mercy held their hands to their mouths and gasped. They had seen it all. Or the end of it, anyway. \u0027Oh, my G-G-God!\u0027 Darcy staggered from the room, leaving Harry and Manolis, mouths agape, staring at Jordan\u0027s bloody corpse...\n Harry and Darcy left Manolis to hand over to the local police (the case was a \u0027suicide\u0027 pure and simple, with plenty of witnesses to prove it) and walked back to their hotel.\n It wasn\u0027t yet 10:00 a.m. but already it was baking hot; the heat seemed to bounce off the cobbles in the narrow streets of the Old Town; Darcy dumped his bloodied jacket in the back of a refuse truck, and cleaned up as best he could in a drinking fountain along the way.\n At the hotel they showered and Harry saw to his bruises, and then for the best part of an hour they sat and did nothing at all ...\n A little before noon Manolis joined them. \u0027What now?\u0027 he wanted to know. \u0027Do we go ahead as planned?\u0027\n Harry had been thinking it over. \u0027Yes and no,\u0027 he answered. \u0027You two go ahead as planned: go to Halki, tomorrow, then Karpathos, and see what you can do. And you\u0027ll have the men from E-Branch to back you up from then on in. But I can\u0027t wait. I have to square it with that bastard. It was what he said at the end. I can\u0027t live with that. It has to be put right.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll go to Hungary?\u0027 Manolis looked washed out, exhausted.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027See, I thought that after Sandra was taken it wouldn\u0027t matter: she\u0027d simply be a vampire, beyond anyone\u0027s help. But I hadn\u0027t reckoned with how he might use her. Well, it could be that she herself is now past caring, but I\u0027m not. So ... I have to go. Not even for her sake anymore but for mine. I may not any longer have what it takes to get him, but I can\u0027t let her go on like that.\u0027\n Darcy shook his head. \u0027Not a good idea, Harry,\u0027 he said. \u0027Look, Janos was goading you, challenging you to take part in a duel he doesn\u0027t think you can win. And you\u0027ve fallen for it. You were right the first time: where Sandra is concerned what\u0027s done is done. Now\u0027s the time to steady up and start thinking ahead, the time for preparation and planning. But it isn\u0027t the time to go off half-cocked and get yourself killed! You know how difficult it\u0027s going to be just getting to Janos in the Carpathians; but you also know that if you simply leave him alone, then sooner or later he\u0027ll come looking for you where you can meet him on your terms. He\u0027ll have to, if he ever again wants to feel safe in the world.\u0027\n \u0027Harry,\u0027 said Manolis, \u0027I think maybe Darcy is right. I still don\u0027t know why that maniac killed himself and not you, but what you\u0027re planning now... it\u0027s like putting your head right back in the noose!\u0027\n \u0027Darcy probably is right,\u0027 Harry agreed, \u0027but I have to play it how I see it. As for Jordan killing himself: that was Janos, showing me how \"powerful\" he is! Yes, and hurting me at the same time. But kill me? No, for it\u0027s like he said: he wants me alive. I\u0027m the Necroscope; I have strange talents; there are secrets locked up in my head that Janos wants to get at. Oh, he can talk to some of the dead - poor bastards - in that monstrous, necromantic way of his, but he can\u0027t command their respect as I do. He\u0027d like to, though, for he\u0027s as vain as the rest of them, but he still doesn\u0027t feel that he\u0027s true Wamphyri. So ... he probably won\u0027t be satisfied until he\u0027s made himself the most powerful vampire the world\u0027s ever seen. And to that end, if he can find some way to steal my skills from me -\u0027 He let it tail off ...\n And immediately, in a lighter tone, continued:\n \u0027 - Anyway, you two are going to have plenty on your own plates. So stop worrying about me and start worrying about yourselves. Manolis, how about those spearguns? And I\u0027d also like you to book me a seat on the next plane for Athens - say sometime tomorrow morning? - with a Budapest connection. And Darcy - \u0027\n \u0027 - Whoa!\u0027 said Darcy. \u0027You changed the subject a bit fast there, Harry. And let\u0027s face it, there\u0027s really no comparison between what we\u0027ll be doing here in the islands and what you\u0027ll be going up against in the Carpathians. Also, Manolis and I, we have each other, and by tomorrow night there\u0027ll be a gang of us. But you\u0027ll be on your own all the way down the line.\u0027\n Harry looked at him with those totally honest, incredibly innocent eyes of his and said, \u0027On my own? Not really, Darcy. I have a great many friends in a great many places, and they\u0027ve never once let me down.\u0027\n Darcy looked at him and thought: God, yes! It\u0027s just that I keep forgetting who - what - you are.\n Manolis didn\u0027t know Harry so well, however. \u0027Friends?\u0027 the Greek said, having missed the point of the exchange. \u0027In Hungary, Romania?\u0027\n Harry looked at him. \u0027There, too,\u0027 he said, and shrugged. \u0027Wherever.\u0027 He stood up. \u0027I\u0027m going to my room now. I have to try and contact some people...\u0027\n \u0027Wherever?\u0027 Manolis repeated him, after he had gone.\n Darcy nodded, and for all the drowsy Mediterranean heat he shivered. \u0027Harry\u0027s friends are legion,\u0027 he explained. \u0027Right across the world, the graveyards are full of them.\u0027\n Harry tried again to contact M\u0026ouml;bius, with as little success as the teeming dead allies whom his Ma had recruited to that same task. He tried to speak with Faethor, too - to check on a certain piece of advice that the extinct vampire had given him, which now seemed highly suspect - and was likewise frustrated; it must be the scorching heat of the midday sun, shimmering in Romania just as it shimmered here, which deterred Faethor\u0027s Wamphyri spirit. Disappointed, finally Harry reached out with his thoughts to touch the Rhodes asylum, where Trevor Jordan now lay in the morgue, peaceful in the wake of his travails and well beyond the torments of the merely physical world. There, at last, he was successful.\n Is that you, Harry? Jordan\u0027s dead voice was at first tinged with anxiety, then relief as he saw that he was correct. But of course it is, for who else could it be? And eagerly: Harry, I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve come. I want you to know that it wasn\u0027t me. I mean, that I could never have -\n \u0027 - Of course you couldn\u0027t!\u0027 Harry cut him off, speaking out loud, as he was wont to do when time, circumstance and location permitted. \u0027I know that, Trevor. It\u0027s one of the reasons I wanted to speak to you: to put your mind at rest and let you know that we understand. It was Janos, using you to relay his thoughts - and that one godawful action - through to us. But,\u0027 (he was as frank as ever), \u0027it\u0027s a damned shame he had to murder you to be doubly sure I\u0027d go after him!\u0027\n Harry, said Jordan, it\u0027s done now and 1 know it can\u0027t be reversed. Oh, I suppose it will get to me later, when it sinks in how much I\u0027ve lost. I suppose they - I mean we - all have to go through that. But right now I\u0027m only interested in revenge. And let\u0027s face it, I haven\u0027t fared as badly as some. God knows I\u0027d rather be dead than undead, in thrall to that monster!\n \u0027Like poor Ken Layard.\u0027\n Yes, like Ken. And Harry felt the dead man\u0027s shudder.\n \u0027That\u0027s something else I have to try to put right,\u0027 the Necroscope sighed. \u0027Ken belongs to Janos now, his locator. But Trevor, Sandra is his, too...\u0027\n For a moment there was only a blank, horrified silence. Then: Oh, God, Harry... I\u0027m so sorry!\n Harry felt the other\u0027s commiserations, nodded, said nothing. And:\n God, it seems impossible! Jordan finally said, speaking to himself as much as to Harry. We came out to Greece to find a few drugs - and look what we found. Death, destruction, and a one-man plague who can burst out any time he\u0027s ready. And powerful? It\u0027s like Yulian Bodescu was a pocket-torch compared to a laser beam. You know, I scanned him by mistake? I was like a tiny spider who fell in a bathful of water, and some bastard pulled the plug! There was no fighting him. Harry, his mind is a great black irresistible whirlpool. And little old me?... I dived right in there head-first!\n \u0027That\u0027s the other thing I want to talk to you about,\u0027 Harry told him. \u0027This control he had over you, even at a distance. I mean, how could such a thing come about? You were a powerful telepath in your own right.\u0027\n Therein lies a tale, Jordan answered, bitterly. And: Harry, we\u0027re all of us like radio stations: our minds, I mean. Most of us operate on very personal channels, our own. We only talk to ourselves. We think to ourselves. Most of us. Telepaths, on the other hand, have this knack of tuning in to other people\u0027s wavelengths. But Janos is a superior and far more sophisticated station. Only let someone pick up his wavelength and he jams their transmission, tracks the signal home and literally takes over! The stronger their beam, the faster he homes in on them. Yes, and the harder they fall. It\u0027s as simple as that.\n \u0027You mean he got to you because you\u0027re a telepath? Ordinary people would be safe, then?\u0027\n I can\u0027t answer yes for a certainty, but I would think so. But one thing I am certain of: with a mind like that he has to be a powerful hypnotist, too. In fact he\u0027ll have all the usual - the unusual? - mental powers of the Wamphyri in spades!\n \u0027So I\u0027ve been told,\u0027 Harry nodded, gloomily. \u0027It makes a nonsense of something Faethor said to me.\u0027\n Faethor? You\u0027ve been talking to that black-hearted bastard again? Harry, he was Janos\u0027s father!\n \u0027I know that,\u0027 said Harry. \u0027But if you don\u0027t speak to them you can\u0027t know them. And that\u0027s my best weapon: knowing them.\u0027\n Well, I suppose you know best what you\u0027re doing. But Harry, never let him into your mind. Be sure to keep the bastard out of your mind. Because once he\u0027s in he\u0027s in for good!\n Which was the opposite of the advice Faethor had given him. \u0027I\u0027ll keep that in mind,\u0027 said Harry, but artlessly, without humour. And: \u0027Trevor, is there anything I can do for you? Any messages?\u0027\n I\u0027ve left a few friends behind. Given time I\u0027ll think of a couple of things to say. Not right now, though. Maybe you can get back to me. I hope so, anyway.\n Trevor, you were a telepath in life. Well, it doesn\u0027t stop there. You won\u0027t be alone, ever. See if I\u0027m not right. And there\u0027s one last thing.\u0027\n Yes?\n \u0027I... I want to make sure you\u0027re cremated. And then, if everything works out, I think I\u0027d like to keep your ashes.\u0027\n Harry, said Jordan in a little while, did anyone ever tell you you\u0027re morbid? Then he actually laughed, however shakily. Hell, I don\u0027t care what happens to my ashes! Though I suppose I\u0027d get to talk to you more often, right? I mean, from your mantelpiece?\n Harry had to grin to keep from crying. \u0027I suppose you would,\u0027 he said. .\n By mid-afternoon things were starting to shape up. Harry still couldn\u0027t contact M\u0026ouml;bius or Faethor, but Manolis and Darcy returned from an outing in the town with an armful of spearguns. They were the Italian \u0027Champion\u0027 models Manolis had recommended, with very powerful single rubber propulsion.\n \u0027I once saw a man accidentally shot in the thigh with one of these,\u0027 the Greek related. \u0027They had to open his leg up and cut the harpoon head right out of him! Our harpoons are being silvered right now. We pick them up tonight.\u0027\n \u0027And my flight to Athens?\u0027 Harry\u0027s resolve was as strong as ever.\n Manolis sighed. \u0027Same as last time. Tomorrow at 2:30. If there\u0027s no trouble with your connection, you\u0027ll be in Budapest by, oh, around 6:45. But we both wish you\u0027d change your mind.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 Darcy agreed. \u0027Tomorrow night our people from E-Branch will be out here. And they\u0027re trying to contact Zek Foener and Jazz Simmons in Zakinthos to see if they\u0027d like to be in on it. We\u0027ll have a hell of a good team, Harry. There\u0027s absolutely no reason why you should go off to Hungary on your own. Someone could go with you at least part of the way. A good telepath or prognosticator, say.\u0027\n \u0027Zek Foener?\u0027 Harry had turned to look sharply, frowningly at Darcy on hearing her name spoken. \u0027And Michael Simmons? Oh, they\u0027ll want to be in on it, all right!\u0027 So far there\u0027d been no chance to report what Trevor Jordan had told him about the vampire\u0027s superior ESP; now he did so, and finished up:\n \u0027Don\u0027t you realize who and what Zek Foener is? Only one of the most proficient telepaths in the world. Just let her mind so much as scrape up against Janos\u0027s and he\u0027d have her! And as for Jazz ... he was a hell of a man to have around on Starside, but this isn\u0027t Starside. The fact is I daren\u0027t take any of our talented people up against Janos. He\u0027d just take them out one by one and use them for his own. I mean, this is the very essence of why I have to handle my side of it alone. Too many good people have lived through too much already just to go risking their necks again now.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re right, of course,\u0027 Darcy nodded. \u0027But you\u0027re our best chance, Harry, our best shot. Which makes it doubly frustrating to simply say nothing and let you go risking your neck! I mean, without you... why, we\u0027d be left stumbling around in the dark!\u0027 Which seemed to say a lot for what he thought of Harry\u0027s chances. But:\n \u0027I won\u0027t argue with you,\u0027 Harry said, quietly. \u0027I\u0027m on my own.\u0027 And his voice held a note of finality, and of a determination which wouldn\u0027t be swayed...\n They hadn\u0027t eaten; that evening they went out to pick up their silvered harpoons and on the way back stopped off at a taverna for a meal and a drink. They ate in silence for a while, until Darcy said: \u0027It\u0027s all boiling up, I can feel it. My talent wishes to hell tomorrow wasn\u0027t coming, but it knows it is.\u0027\n Harry looked up from his large, rare steak. \u0027Let\u0027s just get through the night first, right?\u0027 There was a growl in his voice that Darcy wasn\u0027t used to. It had a hard, unaccustomed edge to it. Tension, he supposed, nerves. But who could blame Harry for that?\n Harry couldn\u0027t know it but he wasn\u0027t going to have a good night. Asleep almost before his head hit the pillows, he was at once assailed by strange dreams: \u0027real\u0027 dreams in the main, but vague and shadowy things which he probably wouldn\u0027t remember in the waking world.\n Ever since his Necroscope talents had developed as a child, Harry had known two sorts of dreams. \u0027Real\u0027 dreams, the subconscious reshuffling of events and memories from the waking world, which anyone might experience, and metaphysical \u0027messages\u0027 in the form of warnings, omens and occasionally visions or glimpses of real events long since over and done with and others yet to come. The latter had presaged his developing dead-speak, enabling the dead in their graves to infiltrate his sleeping mind. He had learned to separate the two types, to know which ones were important and should be remembered, and which to discard as meaningless. Occasionally they would overlap, however, when a conversation with a dead friend might drift into a \u0027real\u0027 dream or nightmare - such as when his Ma had become a shrieking vampire! Or it might just as easily work the other way, when a troubled dream would be soothed by the intervention of a dead friend.\n Tonight he would experience both types separate and intermingled, and all of them nightmarish.\n They started innocuously enough, but as the night progressed so he began to feel a certain mental oppression. If anyone had shared his room, they would have seen him tossing and turning as the weird clearing-house of his mind set up a series of strange scenarios.\n Eventually Harry\u0027s struggles wearied him and he drifted more deeply into dreams, and as was often the case soon found himself in a benighted graveyard. This was not in itself ominous: he need only declare himself and he knew he\u0027d find friends here. Contrary as dreams are, however, he made no effort to identify himself but instead wandered among the weed-grown plots and leaning headstones, all silvered under the moon.\n There was a ground mist which lapped at the humped roots of stunted trees and turned the well-trodden, compacted paths between plots to writhing ribbons of milk. Harry picked his way silently beneath the lunar lamp, and the mist curled almost tangibly about his ankles.\n Then... suddenly he knew he was not alone in this place, and he sensed such a coldness and a silent horror as he\u0027d never before known in any cemetery. He held his breath and listened, but even the beat of his own heart seemed stilled in this now terrible place. And in the next moment he knew why it was terrible. It wasn\u0027t just the preternatural cold and the silence, but the nature of the silence.\n The dead themselves were silent... they lay petrified in their graves, in terror of something which had come among them. But what?\n Harry wanted to flee the place, felt an unaccustomed urge to distance himself from what should be (to him) a sure haven in an uncertain dream landscape; but at the same time he was drawn towards a mist-shrouded corner of the graveyard, where rubbery vegetation grew green and lush and damp from the coiling vapours.\n The vapours of the tomb, he thought, like the cold breath of the dead, leaking upwards from all of these graves! It was an unusual thought, for Harry knew that there was no life in death... was there?\n No, of course not, for the two conditions of Man were quite separate: the living and the dead, distinct from each other as the two faces of a fathomless gorge, and Harry the only living person with the power to bridge the gap.\n Oh? And what of the undead?\n Something squelched underfoot with a sound like bursting bladders of seaweed, and Harry looked down. He stood at the very rim of the rank vegetation, beyond which unnatural mists boiled upwards presumably from some untended tomb. And at his feet ... a cluster of small black mushrooms or puffballs, releasing their scarlet spores even as he stepped amongst them.\n Whose grave was it, he wondered, out of which these fungi siphoned their putrid nourishment? He passed in through a curtain of damp, clinging green, where heavy leaves and clutching creepers seemed reluctant to admit him; but emerging from the other side ... it was as if he\u0027d passed into an entirely different region!\n No mausoleum here. No leaning, lichened tombstones or weedy plots but ... a morass?\n A swamp, yes. Harry stood on the rim of a vast, misted expanse of quag, rotting trees and rank vines; and all around, wherever there was semi-solid ground, the wrinkled black toadstools grew in diseased, ugly clumps, releasing their drifting red spores.\n He moved to turn, retreat, retrace his steps, only to discover himself rooted to the spot, fascinated by a sudden commotion in the leprous grey mire. Directly to the fore, the quag was shuddering, forming slow doughy ripples as if something huge stirred just below the surface, causing vile black bubbles to rise and belch and release their gases.\n And in another moment, up from the depths of the bog rose ... the steaming slab of a headstone, complete with its own rectangular plot of hideously quaking earth!\n Until now, however unquiet, Harry\u0027s dream had been languid as a strange slow-motion ballet - but the rest of it came with nerve-shattering speed and ferocity.\n Longing to turn and run but still rooted there, he could only watch as the mush of the bog slopped from the thrusting headstone and dripped from the rim of the risen tomb to reveal its true nature... indeed to reveal the identity of its dweller! The legend carved in the slab where the oozing quag gurgled from its grooves was hardly unfamiliar. It said, quite simply:\n HARRY KEOGH: NECROSCOPE\n Then-\n The mound of the burial plot burst open, hurling great clods of earth in all directions! And lying there in that open grave, like some morbid parasite in a wound, a semblance or grotesque caricature of Harry himself... but festooned in all its parts with ripening, spore-bearing mushrooms!\n Harry tried to scream and had no mouth; his likeness did the job for him; with a monstrous grunt it sat up in its gaping tomb, opened its yellow, pus-filled eyes, and screamed until it rotted down into a gurgling black stump!\n Harry put up a hand before his eyes to ward off the sight of the thing... and his hand was covered with black nodules, like monstrous melanomas, growing and sprouting from his flesh even as he stared aghast! And now he saw why he couldn\u0027t run: because he was rooted to the spot, was himself a hybrid fungus thing, whose tendril toes had hooked themselves into the bank of rotting soil above the quivering swamp!\n He turned up his face to the moon and screamed then, not with his puffball-spewing mouth but with his mind:\n Christ! Oh, Christ! Oh, Christ! And before the dry-rot fungus webbing crawled over his eyes to seal them, too, he saw that in fact the moon was a skull which laughed at him from a sky of blood! But before the sky could rain its red on him, the moon-skull reached down skeletal arms to gather him up, draw him from the sucking swamp and refashion his limbs back into a man-shape. And:\n Haarrry! the moon sang to him with Sandra\u0027s voice. Harry! Oh, why don\u0027t you answer me?\n The old dream receded apace with the new one\u0027s advance. Harry tossed in his bed and sweated, and sent out tremulous deadspeak thoughts into the dark of the night. But:\n No, no, Harry, came Sandra\u0027s urgent mental voice again. I don\u0027t need that for I\u0027m not dead. Better if I were, perhaps, but I\u0027m not. And only look at me now, Harry, only look at me now!\n He forced open his squeezed-shut eyes and looked, and tried to accept the strangeness of what he saw.\n The scene itself was weird and Gothic, and yet Harry knew the people in it well enough. Sandra, striding to and fro, to and fro, wringing her hands and tearing her hair; and Ken Layard, hunched over a wooden table, strangely slumped and crooked where he crushed his head between taloned hands and gazed feverishly on the unguessed caverns of his own mind. Sandra the telepath, and Layard the locator. Janos\u0027s creatures now.\n In their entirety?\n Harry was immaterial, incorporeal, without body. He knew it at once, that same non-feeling of unbeing which had been his lot in the strange times between the death of the physical Harry Keogh and his mind\u0027s incorporation with the brain-dead Alec Kyle. He was here not in the flesh but in spirit alone. Incredible, indeed impossible outside the scope of dreams and without the aid of the metaphysical M\u0026ouml;bius Continuum. And yet with his Necroscope\u0027s instinct, Harry knew that this was more than just a dream.\n He examined his surroundings.\n A huge bedchamber of a room, with a massive four-poster in an arched-over recess in a raw stone wall. Other than this the room contained a low cot with a straw-stuffed mattress and mouldy blankets, wide wooden chairs and a rough table, a great fireplace and blackened flue, and ancient tapestries rotting on the gaunt stone walls. There were no windows and only one door, which was of massive oak and iron-banded. It was closed and displayed neither doorknob nor handle; Harry guessed it would be bolted and barred from the outside.\n The only light came from a pair of squat candles wax-welded to the table where Layard sat hunched in his fever of concentration; they illuminated flickeringly a vaulted ceiling, with nitre crystals crusted in the mortar between massively carved keystone blocks. The floor was of stone flags, the atmosphere cold and unwelcoming, the entire scene fraught with the menace of a dungeon. The place was a dungeon, or as close as made no difference.\n A dungeon in the ruined castle of the Ferenczy.\n \u0027Harry?\u0027 Sandra\u0027s voice was a hushed, frightened whisper, kept low for fear of alerting... someone. She stopped pacing and hugged herself tightly as an involuntary shudder of terror - and then of sudden awareness -racked her body. Her mouth fell open in a gasp and she strained her face forward, staring at nothing. \u0027Harry, is that... you?\u0027\n Ken Layard at once looked up and said: \u0027Do you have him?\u0027 His face was gaunt, twisted from some unbearable agony, with cold sweat standing on his brow. But as he spoke, the scene began to waver and Harry, however unwillingly, to withdraw.\n \u0027Don\u0027t let it slip]\u0027 Sandra hissed. She rushed to the table, caught Layard\u0027s head in her hands, lent her will to his in bolstering whatever extrasensory feat it was which he performed. And the room grew solid again, and at last the incorporeal Necroscope understood.\n As yet they were not entirely in Janos\u0027s thrall. They were his, yes, but he must needs watch them, lock them up when he himself was not close by ... like now. And because they knew they were doomed to his service as undead vampires, so they combined their ESP in this one last effort to defy him, while still their minds were at least in part their own. Layard had used his talent to locate and \u0027fix\u0027 Harry in his bed in a Rhodes hotel, and Sandra had followed Layard\u0027s co-ordinates to engage the Necroscope in telepathic communication. But with their powers enhanced or amplified by the vampire stuff Janos had put into them, they had succeeded above their expectations. They had not only sought Harry out and contacted him, but given him telepathic and visual access to their dungeon prison!\n Sandra was dressed in some gauzy shift which let the light of the candles strike right through; she wore neither shoes nor underclothes; there were dark, angry blotches on her breasts and buttocks which could only be bruises. Layard\u0027s attire was little more substantial: a coarse blanket which he\u0027d belted into a sort of cassock. It would be bitterly cold down there in the secret core of the old castle, but Harry rightly supposed that the cold no longer affected them.\n \u0027Harry! Harry!\u0027 she hissed again, turning her gaze directly towards his unbodied presence where he viewed them. \u0027Harry, I know we have you! So why don\u0027t you answer me?\u0027 Her fear and frustration were obvious in the huge orbs of her eyes.\n \u0027You... you have me,\u0027 he finally spoke up. \u0027It took a moment to get used to, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n \u0027Harry!\u0027 her gasp made a plume of mist in the cold air. \u0027My God, we really do have you!\u0027\n \u0027Sandra,\u0027 he said, more animated now, \u0027I\u0027m asleep and, well, dreaming, sort of. But I can wake up, or be woken up, at any time. After that... we might still be in contact and we might not. You\u0027ve done this - got in touch with me - for a reason, so now it would be better if you just got on with it.\u0027\n His words - so cold, distant, empty - seemed to stun her. He wasn\u0027t how she\u0027d expected him to be. She went to the table and flopped into a chair alongside Layard. \u0027Harry,\u0027 she said, \u0027I\u0027ve been used, changed, poisoned. If you\u0027ve ever loved me - especially feeling what you\u0027d be feeling for me now - then I know you\u0027d be screaming. And Harry, you\u0027re not screaming.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m feeling nothing,\u0027 he said. \u0027I daren\u0027t feel anything! I\u0027m talking to you, that\u0027s all, but without looking inside. Don\u0027t ask me to look inside, too, Sandra.\u0027\n She put her head in her hands and sobbed raggedly. \u0027Cold, so cold. Were you ever, ever in your life warm, Harry?\u0027\n \u0027Sandra,\u0027 he said, \u0027you\u0027re a vampire. And though you probably don\u0027t know it, you\u0027re already displaying the traits of a vampire. They rarely converse but play word-games. They play on emotions they don\u0027t themselves share or understand, such as love, honesty, honour. And others which they understand only too well, like hate and lust. They seek to confuse issues, and so blunt the minds of their opponents. And to a vampire each and every other creature who is not a thrall is an opponent. You sought me out, doubtless because you had important things to tell me, but now the vampire in you delays and distracts you, causes you to deviate from your course.\u0027\n \u0027You never loved me!\u0027 she accused, spitting out the words and showing her altered teeth. And for the first time he saw how her eyes, and Ken Layard\u0027s, were yellow and feral. Later they would turn red... if he were to fail and let them have a later.\n And now Harry looked again, more closely, at these two prisoners of Janos, one who\u0027d been a lover and the other something of a friend, and saw how well the vampire had done his work on them. Apart from their eyes, their flesh had little of human life in it; they were undead, with more than their fair share of Janos himself in them. Sandra\u0027s beauty, hitherto natural, was now entirely unearthly; and Layard: he looked like a three-dimensional cardboard figure, which had been partly crushed.\n Harry\u0027s thoughts were as good as spoken words. \u0027But I was crushed, Harry!\u0027 Layard looked up and told him, speaking to the empty air. \u0027On Karpathos, in a moment when Janos was distracted, I broke a length of driftwood and tried to put its point through him. He called his men off the Lazarus and had me tied down on the beach, where they dropped boulders on me from the low cliffs! They only stopped when I was quite broken and buried. The vampire stuff in me is healing me now, but I\u0027ll never be straight again.\u0027\n Harry\u0027s pity welled up and threatened to engulf him, but he forced it down. \u0027Why did you call me here? To advise me, or to weaken me with remorse and regrets -and with fear for myself? Are you your own creatures, or are you now entirely his?\u0027\n \u0027At the moment,\u0027 Layard answered, \u0027we\u0027re our own. For how long... who can say? Until he returns. And after that... the change is working and can\u0027t be reversed. You are right, Harry: we are vampires. We want to help you, but the dark stuff in us obfuscates.\u0027\n \u0027We make no progress,\u0027 said Harry.\n \u0027Only say you loved me!\u0027 Sandra pleaded.\n \u0027I loved you,\u0027 Harry told her.\n \u0027Liar!\u0027 she hissed.\n Harry felt torn. \u0027I can\u0027t love,\u0027 he said, in something of desperation, and for the first time in his life realized it was probably true. Once upon a time, maybe, but no longer. Manolis Papastamos had been right after all: he was a cold one.\n Sandra shrank down into herself. \u0027No love in you,\u0027 she said. \u0027And should we advise you, so that you may kill us?\u0027\n \u0027But isn\u0027t that the point of all this?\u0027 said Layard. \u0027Isn\u0027t it what we want, while still we have a choice?\u0027\n \u0027Is it? Oh, is it?\u0027 She clutched one of his broken hands. And to Harry: \u0027I thought I no longer wanted to live, not like this. But now I don\u0027t know, I don\u0027t know. Harry, Janos has... has ... he has known me. He knows me! There\u0027s no cavity of my body he hasn\u0027t filled! I loathe him... and yet I want him, too! And that\u0027s the worst: to lust after a monster. But lust is part of life, after all, and I\u0027ve always loved life. So what if you win? Will it be for me as it was for the Lady Karen?\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 the thought repelled him. \u0027I couldn\u0027t do anything like that again. Not to you, not to anyone, not ever. If I win, it will be as easy for you as I can make it.\u0027\n \u0027Except you can\u0027t win!\u0027 Layard moaned. \u0027I only wish you could.\u0027\n \u0027But he might! He might!\u0027 Sandra jumped up. \u0027Perhaps Janos is wrong!\u0027\n \u0027About what?\u0027 Harry felt he\u0027d broken through and was now getting somewhere. \u0027Perhaps he\u0027s wrong about what?\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027s looked into the future,\u0027 Sandra said. \u0027It\u0027s one of his talents. He\u0027s read the future, and seen victory for himself.\u0027\n \u0027What has he seen? What, exactly?\u0027\n \u0027That you will come,\u0027 she answered, \u0027and that there will be fire and death and thunder such as to wake the dead. That the living and the dead and the undead shall all be embroiled in it: a chaos spawning only one survivor, the most terrible, most powerful vampire of all. Ah, and not merely a vampire but... Wamphyri!\u0027\n \u0027A paradox,\u0027 Layard sobbed. \u0027For now you know the reason why you must not come!\u0027\n Harry nodded (if only to himself), and said: \"That\u0027s always the way it is when you read the future.\u0027\n Then-\n - The dungeon\u0027s heavy door burst open! Janos stood there, handsome as the devil, evil as hell. And hell\u0027s fire burned in his eyes. And before the scene dissolved entirely and turned to darkness, Harry heard him say:\n \u0027So, give you enough rope and you hang yourselves. I knew you would contact him! Well, and what you have done for yourselves you can doubtless do for me. So be it!\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/necroscope-iv-deadspeak-necroscope-4/page-13.html","bookId":2437,"book":{"id":2437,"title":"Necroscope IV: Deadspeak (Necroscope #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Several years after his return to earth Harry Sr. is trouble by nightmares of resurgent Vampires.
