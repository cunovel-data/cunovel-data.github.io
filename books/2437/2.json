{"id":78827,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"2 Seekers Savirsin, Romania; evening of the first Friday in August 1983; the Gaststube of an inn perched on the steep mountainside at the eastern extreme of the town, where the road climbs up through many hairpin bends and out of sight into the pines. Three young Americans, tourists by their looks and rig, sat together at a chipped, ages-blackened, heavily-grained circular wooden table in one corner of the barroom. Their clothes were casual; one of them smoked a cigarette; their drinks were local beers, not especially strong but stinging to the palate and very refreshing. At the bar itself a pair of gnarled mountain men, hunters complete with rifles so ancient they must surely qualify as antiques, had guffawed and slapped backs and bragged of their prowess - and not only as hunters of beasts - for over an hour before one of them suddenly took on a surprised look, staggered back from the bar, and with a slurred oath aimed himself reeling through the door out into the smoky blue-grey twilight. His rifle lay on the bar where he\u0027d left it; the bartender, not a little gingerly, took it up and put it carefully away out of sight, then continued to wash and dry the day\u0027s used glasses. The departed hunter\u0027s drinking companion - and partner in crime or whatever - roared with renewed laughter; he slapped the bar explosively, finished off the other\u0027s plum brandy and threw back his own, then looked around for more sport. And of course he spied the Americans where they sat at their ease, making casual conversation. In fact, and until now, their conversation had centred on him, but he didn\u0027t know that. He ordered another drink - and whatever they were drinking for them at the table; one for the barman, too -and swayed his way over to them. Before filling the order the barman took his rifle, too, and placed it safely with the other. \u0027Gogosu,\u0027 the old hunter growled, thumbing himself in his leather-clad chest. \u0027Emil Gogosu. And you? Touristi, are you?\u0027 He spoke Romanian, the dialect of the area, which leaned a little towards Hungarian. All three, they smiled back at him, two of them somewhat warily. But the third translated, and quickly answered: Tourists, yes. From America, the USA. Sit down, Emil Gogosu, and talk to us.\u0027 Taken by surprise, the hunter said: \u0027Eh? Eh? You have the tongue? You\u0027re a guide for these two, eh? Profitable, is it?\u0027 The younger man laughed. \u0027God, no! I\u0027m with them -I\u0027m one of them - an American!\u0027 \u0027Impossible!\u0027 Gogosu declared, taking a seat. \u0027What? Why, J never before heard such a thing! Foreigners speaking the tongue? You\u0027re pulling my leg, right?\u0027 Gogosu was peasant Romanian through and through. He had a brown, weather-beaten face, grey bull-horn moustaches stained yellow in the middle from pipe-smoking, long sideburns curling in towards his upper lip, and penetrating grey eyes under bristling, even greyer brows. He wore a patched leather jacket with a high collar that buttoned up to the neck over a white shirt whose sleeves fitted snug at the wrist. His fur caciula cap was held fast under the right epaulet of his jacket; a half-filled bandolier passed under the left epaulet, crossed his chest diagonally, fed itself up under his right arm and across his back. A wide leather belt supported a sheath and hunter\u0027s knife, several pouches, and his coarsely-woven trousers which he wore tucked into his climber\u0027s pigskin calf-boots. A small man, still he looked strong and wiry. All in all, he was a picturesque specimen. \u0027We were talking about you,\u0027 their interpreter told him. \u0027Eh? Oh?\u0027 Gogosu looked from one face to the next all the way round. \u0027About me? So I\u0027m a figure of curiosity, ami?\u0027 \u0027Of admiration,\u0027 the wily American answered. \u0027A hunter, by your looks, and good at it - or so we\u0027d guess. You\u0027d know this country, these mountains, well?\u0027 \u0027There isn\u0027t a man knows \u0027em better!\u0027 Gogosu declared. But he was wily, too, and now his eyes narrowed a little. \u0027You\u0027re looking for a guide, eh?\u0027 \u0027We could be, we could be,\u0027 the other slowly nodded. \u0027But there are guides and there are guides. You ask some guides to show you a ruined castle on a mountain and they promise you the earth! The very castle of Dracula, they say! And then they take you to a pile of rocks that looks like someone\u0027s pigsty collapsed! Aye, ruins, Emil Gogosu, that\u0027s what we\u0027re interested in. For photographs, for pictures... for mood and atmosphere.\u0027 The barman delivered their drinks and Gogosu tossed his straight back. \u0027Eh? Eh? You\u0027re going to make one of those picture things, right? Moving pictures? The old vampire in his castle, chasing the girls with the wobbling breasts? God, yes, I\u0027ve seen \u0027em! The pictures, I mean, down in old Lugoj where there\u0027s a picture-house. Not the girls, no ... sod-all wobbly tits round here, I can tell you! Withered paps at best in this neck of the woods, my lads! But I\u0027ve seen the pictures. And that\u0027s what you\u0027re looking for, eh? Ruins Oddly, and despite the brandy he\u0027d consumed, the old boy seemed to have sobered a little. His eyes focussed more readily, became more fixed in their orbits as he studied the Americans each in his turn. First there was their interpreter. He was a queer one for sure, with his knowledge of the tongue and what all. He was tall, this one, a six-footer with inches to spare, long in the leg, lean in the hip and broad at the shoulders. And now that Gogosu looked closer, he could see that he wasn\u0027t just American. Not all American, anyway. \u0027What\u0027s your name, eh? What\u0027s your name?\u0027 The hunter took the young man\u0027s hand and made to tighten his grip on it ... but it was snatched back at once and down out of sight under the table. \u0027George,\u0027 the owner of the refused hand quickly replied, reclaiming Gogosu\u0027s startled-to-flight attention. \u0027George Vulpe.\u0027 \u0027Vulpe?\u0027 the hunter laughed out loud and slapped the table, making their drinks dance. \u0027Oh, I\u0027ve known a few Vulpes in my time. But George? What kind of a name is George to go with a name like Vulpe, eh? Now come on, let\u0027s be straight, you and I... you mean Gheorghe, don\u0027t you?\u0027 The other\u0027s dark eyes darkened more yet and seemed to brood a very little, but then they relaxed and exchanged grin for grin with the grey eyes of their inquisitor. \u0027Well, you\u0027re a sharp one, Emil,\u0027 their owner finally said. \u0027Sharp-eyed, too! Yes, I was Romanian once. There\u0027s a story to it, but it\u0027s not much...\u0027 The gnarled old hunter returned to studying him. \u0027Tell it anyway,\u0027 he said, giving Vulpe a slow once-over. And the young man shrugged and sat back in his chair. \u0027Well, I was born here, under the mountains,\u0027 he said, his voice as soft as his deceptively soft mouth. He smiled and flashed perfect teeth; so they should be, Gogosu thought, in a man only twenty-six or -seven years old. \u0027Born here,\u0027 Vulpe repeated, \u0027yes ... but it\u0027s only a dim and distant memory now. My folks were travellers, which accounts for my looks. You recognized me from my tanned skin, right? And my dark eyes?\u0027 \u0027Aye,\u0027 Gogosu nodded. \u0027And from the thin lobes of your ears, which would take a nice gold ring. And from your high forehead and wolfish jaw, which aren\u0027t uncommon in the Szgany. Oh, your origins are obvious enough, to a man who can see. So what happened?\u0027 \u0027Happened?\u0027 Again Vulpe\u0027s shrug. \u0027My parents moved to the cities, settled down, became \"workers\" instead of the drones they\u0027d always been.\u0027 \u0027Drones? You believe that?\u0027 \u0027No, but the authorities did. They gave them a flat in Craiova, right next to the new railway. The mortar was rotten and shaky from the trains; the plaster was coming off the walls; someone\u0027s toilet in the flat above leaked on us ... but it was good enough for workshy drones, they said. And until I was eleven that\u0027s where I\u0027d play, next to the tracks. Then... one night a train was derailed. It ploughed right into our block, took away a wall, brought the whole place crashing down. I was lucky enough to live through it but my people died. And for a while I thought I\u0027d be better off dead, too, because my spine had been crushed and I was a cripple. But someone heard about me, and there was a scheme on at the time - an exchange of doctors and patients, between American and Romanian rehabilitation clinics - and because I was an orphan I was given priority. Not bad for a drone, eh? So ... I went to the USA. And they fixed me up. What\u0027s more, they adopted me, too. Two of them did, anyway. And because I was only a boy and there was no one left back here,\u0027 (yet again, his shrug) \u0027why, I was allowed to stay!\u0027 \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Gogosu. \u0027And so now you\u0027re an American. Well, I\u0027ll believe you... but it\u0027s strange for Gypsies to leave the open road. Sometimes they get thrown out and go their own ways - disputes and what have you in the camps, usually over a woman or a horse - but rarely to settle in towns. What was it with your folks? Did they cross the Gypsy king or something?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. I was only a boy,\u0027 Vulpe answered. \u0027I think perhaps they feared for me: I was a weak little thing, apparently, a runt. At any rate, they left the night I was born, and covered their tracks, and never went back.\u0027 \u0027A runt?\u0027 Gogosu raised an eyebrow, looked Vulpe up and down yet again. \u0027Well, you\u0027d not know it now. But they covered their tracks, you say? That\u0027s it, then. Say no more. There\u0027d been trouble in the camp, for sure. I\u0027ll give you odds your father and mother were secret lovers, and she was promised to another. Then you came along so he stole her away. Oh, it happens.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s a very romantic notion,\u0027 Vulpe said. \u0027And who knows? - you could be right.\u0027 \u0027My God, we\u0027re ignorant!\u0027 Gogosu suddenly exploded, beckoning to the barman. \u0027Here\u0027s you and me chatting in this old tongue of ours, and your two friends bewildered and left out entirely. Now let me get you all another drink and then we\u0027ll have some introductions. I want to know why you\u0027re here, and what I can do to help, and how much you\u0027ll pay me to take you to some real ruins!\u0027 \u0027The drinks are on us,\u0027 said Vulpe. \u0027And no arguments. God, do you expect us to keep up with you, Emil Gogosu? Now slow down or you\u0027ll have us all under the table before we\u0027ve even got things sorted out! As for introductions, that\u0027s easy:\u0027 He clasped the shoulder of the American closest to him. \"This great gangly one is Seth Armstrong, from Texas. They build them tall there, Emil, as you can see. But then it\u0027s a big state. Why, your entire Romania would fit into Texas alone three times over!\u0027 Gogosu was suitably impressed. He shook hands with Armstrong and looked him over. The Texan was big and raw-boned, with honest blue eyes in an open face, sparse straw-coloured hair, arms and legs as long and thin as poles. His nose was long over a wide, expressive mouth and a heavy, bristly chin. Just a little short of seventy-eight inches, even seated Armstrong came up head and shoulders above the others. \u0027Hah!\u0027 said the hunter. \u0027This Texas would have to be big to accommodate such as him!\u0027 Vulpe translated, then nodded in the direction of the third member of his group. \u0027And this one,\u0027 he said, \u0027is Randy Laverne from Madison, Wisconsin. It mightn\u0027t be so mountainous up there, but believe me it can get just as cold!\u0027 \u0027Cold?\u0027 said Gogosu. \u0027Well, that shouldn\u0027t bother this one. I envy him all that good meat on his bones - and all the good meals it took to put it there - but it\u0027s not much use in climbing. Me, I\u0027m able to cling to the rocks snug as a lichen, in places where gravity would get him for sure.\u0027 Vulpe translated and Laverne laughed good-naturedly. He was the youngest and smallest (or at least the shortest) of the three Americans: twenty-five, freckle-faced, way overweight and constantly hungry. His face was round and topped with wavy red hair; his green eyes friendly and full of fun; the corners of his eyes and mouth running into mazes of laughter lines. But there was nothing soft about him: his huge hands were incredibly strong, a legacy of his blacksmith father. \u0027Very well,\u0027 said George Vulpe, \u0027so now we know each other. Or rather, you know us. But what about you, Emil? You\u0027re a hunter, yes, but what else?\u0027 \u0027Nothing else!\u0027 said Gogosu. \u0027I don\u0027t need to be anything else. I\u0027ve a small house and a smaller woman in Ilia; in the summer I hunt wild pig and sell meat to the butchers and skins to the tailors and boot makers; in the winter I take furs and kill a few foxes, and they hire me ,to shoot the occasional wolf. And so I make a living -barely! And now maybe I\u0027ll be a guide, too. Why not? -for I know the heights as well as the eagles who nest in \u0027em.\u0027 \u0027And the odd ruined castle? You can show us one of those, too?\u0027 \u0027Castles abound,\u0027 said Gogosu. \u0027But you told me there are guides and guides. Well, so are there castles and castles. And you\u0027re right: anyone can show you a tumble of old boulders and call it a castle. But I, Emil Gogosu, can show you a castle!\u0027 The Americans Armstrong and Laverne got the gist of this and became excited. Armstrong, in his Texas drawl, said: \u0027Hey, George, tell him what we\u0027re really doing here. Explain to him how close he was when he talked about Dracula and vampires and all.\u0027 \u0027In America,\u0027 Vulpe told the hunter, \u0027all over the world, in fact, Transylvania and the Carpatii Meridionali are famous! Not so much for their dramatic beauty or gaunt isolation as for their myths and legends. You talked of Dracula, who had his origins in a cruel Vlad of olden times... but don\u0027t you know that every year the tourists flock in their droves to visit the great Drakul\u0027s homeland and the castles where he\u0027s said to have dwelled? Indeed, it\u0027s big business. And we believe it could be even bigger.\u0027 \u0027Pah!\u0027 said Gogosu. \u0027Why, this whole country is steeped in olden lore and superstitious myths. This impaler Vlad\u0027s just a one of them.\u0027 He leaned closer, lowered his voice and his eyes went big and round. \u0027I could take you to a castle old as the mountains themselves, a shattered keep so feared that even today it\u0027s left entirely alone in a trackless place, like naked bones under the moon, kept secret in the lee of haunted crags!\u0027 He sat back and nodded his satisfaction with their expressions. \u0027There!\u0027 After Vulpe had translated, Randy Laverne said, \u0027Wow!\u0027 And more soberly: \u0027But... do you think he\u0027s for real?\u0027 And the hunter knew what he\u0027d said. He stared straight and frowning into Laverne\u0027s wide eyes and instructed Vulpe: \u0027You tell him that I shot the last man who called me a liar right in his backside. And you can also tell him this: that in these ruins I know, there\u0027s a great grey wolf keeps watch even today. And that\u0027s a fact, for I\u0027ve tried to shoot him, too!\u0027 Vulpe began to translate, but in the middle of it the hunter started to laugh. \u0027Hey! Hey!\u0027 he said. \u0027Not so serious! And don\u0027t take my threats too much to heart. Oh, I know my story\u0027s a wild-sounding thing but it\u0027s true all the same. Pay me for my time and trouble and come see for yourselves. Well, what do you say?\u0027 Vulpe held up a cautionary hand and Gogosu looked at it curiously in the moment before it was withdrawn. It had felt strange, that hand, when he\u0027d grasped it. And there\u0027d been something not quite right about it when Vulpe had clasped the gangling Armstrong\u0027s shoulder. Also, Vulpe seemed shy about his hands and kept them out of sight most of the time. \u0027Now wait,\u0027 said the young expatriate Romanian, reclaiming the hunter\u0027s attention. \u0027Let\u0027s first see if we\u0027re talking about the right place.\u0027 \u0027The right place?\u0027 said Gogosu, puzzled. \u0027And just how many such places do you think there are?\u0027 \u0027I meant,\u0027 Vulpe explained, \u0027let\u0027s see if maybe we\u0027ve heard of this castle of yours.\u0027 \u0027I doubt it. You\u0027ll not find it on any modern maps, and that\u0027s for sure. I reckon the authorities think that if they leave it alone - if they just ignore it for long enough -then maybe it\u0027ll finally crumble away! No, no, you\u0027ve not heard of this place, I\u0027m sure.\u0027 \u0027Well, let\u0027s check it out anyway,\u0027 said Vulpe. \u0027You see, the deeds, territories and history of the original Dracula -I mean of the Wallachian prince from whom Dracula took his name - are well chronicled and absolutely authentic. An Englishman turned the fact into fiction, that\u0027s all, and in so doing started a legend. Then there was a famous Frenchman who also wrote about a castle in the Carpathians, and possibly started a legend or two of his own. And finally an American did the same thing. \u0027Now the thing is, this American - his name would mean nothing to you - has since become very famous. If we could find his castle ... it could be the Dracula story all over again! Tourists? Ah, but you\u0027d see some touristi then, Emil Gogosu! And who knows but that you\u0027d be chief guide, eh?\u0027 Gogosu chewed the centre of his moustache. \u0027Huh!\u0027 he finally snorted; but his eyes had grown very bright and not a little greedy. He rubbed his nose, finally said: \u0027Very well, so what do you want to know? How can we decide if the castle I know and the one you\u0027re looking for is one and the same, eh?\u0027 \u0027It might be simpler than you think,\u0027 said Vulpe. \u0027For example, how long has this place of yours been a ruin?\u0027 \u0027Oh, it blew up before my time,\u0027 Gogosu answered with a shrug - and was at once astonished to see Vulpe give a great start! \u0027Eh?\u0027 But already the American was translating to his friends, and astonishment and wonder were mirrored in their faces, too. Finally Vulpe turned again to the hunter. \u0027Blew up, you say? You mean... exploded?\u0027 \u0027Or bombed, yes,\u0027 said Gogosu, frowning. \u0027When a wall falls it falls, but some of these walls have been blasted outwards, hurled afar.\u0027 Vulpe was very excited now, but he tried not to show it. \u0027And did it have a name, this castle? What of its owner before it fell? That could be very important.\u0027 \u0027Its name?\u0027 Gogosu screwed up his face in concentration. He tapped his forehead, leaned back in his chair, finally shook his head. \u0027My father\u0027s father had old maps,\u0027 he said. \u0027The name of the place was on them. That\u0027s where I first saw it and when I first decided to go and see it. But its name... it\u0027s gone now.\u0027 Vulpe translated. \u0027Maps like this one?\u0027 said Armstrong. He produced a copy of an old Romanian map and spread it on the table. It soaked up a little beer but otherwise was fine. \u0027Like this one, aye,\u0027 Gogosu nodded, \u0027but older, far older. This is just a copy. Here, let me see.\u0027 He smoothed the map out, stared at it in several places. \u0027Not shown,\u0027 he said. \u0027My castle is not shown. Just a blank space. Well, that\u0027s understandable enough. Gloomy old place. It\u0027s like I said: they\u0027d like to forget it. Legends? You don\u0027t know the half of it!\u0027 And a moment later: \u0027Ahhhr he jerked back in his seat and clutched at his forehead with both hands. \u0027Jesusr cried Laverne. \u0027Is he OK?\u0027 \u0027OK, yes ... OK!\u0027 said Emil Gogosu. And to Vulpe: \u0027Now I remember, Gheorghe. It was... Ferenczy!\u0027 Vulpe\u0027s bottom jaw, and those of his friends, fell open. \u0027Jesus!\u0027 said Laverne again, this time in a whisper. \u0027The Castle Ferenczy?\u0027 Armstrong reached over and grabbed the hunter\u0027s forearm. Gogosu nodded. \u0027That\u0027s it. And that\u0027s the one, eh?\u0027 Vulpe and the others fell back in their seats, gaped at each other; they acted bewildered, confused or simply astonished. But at last Vulpe said, \u0027Yes, that\u0027s the one. And you\u0027ll take us to it? Tomorrow?\u0027 \u0027Oh, be sure I will - \u0027 said Gogosu,\u0027 - for a price!\u0027 And he looked at Vulpe\u0027s hands where he\u0027d spread them on the table, holding down the map. Vulpe saw where the hunter was looking but this time made no attempt to hide his hands away. Instead, he merely raised an eyebrow. \u0027An accident?\u0027 the old Romanian asked him. \u0027If so, they patched you up rather cleverly.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Vulpe answered, \u0027no accident. I was born like this. It\u0027s just that my parents always taught me to hide them away, that\u0027s all. And so I do, except from my friends...\u0027 Because of the mountains, the sun seemed a little late in rising. When it did it came up hot and smoky. At eight-thirty the three Americans were waiting for Gogosu on the dusty road outside the inn, their packs at their feet, peaked caps on their heads with tinted visors to keep out the worst of the sun. The old hunter had told them he\u0027d \u0027collect\u0027 them here, at this hour, though they hadn\u0027t been sure exactly what he\u0027d meant. Randy Laverne had just drained a small bottle of beer and put it down to one side of the inn\u0027s doorstep when they heard the rattle and clatter of a local bus. These were so rare as to be near-fabulous; certainly the arrival of one such demanded a photograph or two; Seth Armstrong got out his camera and started snapping as the beaten-up bus came lurching out of the pines and down the serpentine road towards the inn. The thing was a wonderful contraption: bald tyres, bonnet vibrating to a blur over the back-firing engine, windows bleary and fly-specked. The driver\u0027s window was especially bloody, from the eviscerations of a thousand suicided insects; and Emil Gogosu was leaning out of the folding doors at the front with a huge grin stamped on his leathery face, waving at them, indicating they should get aboard. The bus shuddered to a halt; the driver grinned, nodded and held up a roll of brown tickets; Gogosu stepped down and helped the three strap their packs to running-boards which went the full length of this ancient vehicle. Then they were aboard, paid their fare, collapsed or were shaken into bone-jarring seats as the driver engaged a low gear to let the one-in-five downward slope do the work of his engine. George Vulpe was seated beside Gogosu. \u0027OK,\u0027 he said, when he\u0027d recovered his breath, \u0027so where are we going?\u0027 \u0027First the payment,\u0027 said the hunter. \u0027Old man,\u0027 Vulpe returned, \u0027I\u0027ve this feeling you don\u0027t much trust us!\u0027 \u0027Not so much of the \"old\" - I\u0027m only fifty-four,\u0027 said Gogosu. \u0027I weather easy. But even so, I didn\u0027t get this old without learning that it\u0027s sometimes best to collect your pay before the fact! Trust has nothing to do with it. I don\u0027t want you falling off a mountain with my wages in your pocket, that\u0027s all!\u0027 And he burst into laughter at Vulpe\u0027s expression. But in another moment: \u0027We\u0027re going down to Lipova where we\u0027ll pick up a train to Sebis. Then we\u0027ll try to hitch a ride on a cart to Halmagiu village. And then we start climbing! Actually it\u0027s a longcut. You know what that is? The opposite to a shortcut. You see, the castle is only, oh, maybe fifty kilometres from here as the crow flies - but we\u0027re not crows. So instead of crossing the Zarundului we\u0027re going round \u0027em. Can\u0027t cross \u0027em anyway; no roads. And Halmagiu is a good base camp for the climb. Now don\u0027t go getting all worried: it\u0027s not that much of a climb, not in daylight. If an \"old man\" like me can do it, you young \u0027uns should shoot up there like goats!\u0027 \u0027Couldn\u0027t we have taken the train from Savirsin all the way?\u0027 Vulpe wanted to know. \u0027If there was one scheduled. But there isn\u0027t. Don\u0027t be so eager. We\u0027ll get there. You did say you had six days left before you have to be in Bucuresti to catch your plane? So what\u0027s the hurry? The way I reckon it we should be in Sebis before noon - if we make the connection in Lipova. There may be a bus from Sebis to Halmagiu, which would get us there by, oh, two-thirty at the latest. Or we hitch rides ... on trucks, carts, what have you. So we could get in late, and have to put up there for the night. Any time after four is too late - unless you maybe fancy sleeping on the mountain?\u0027 \u0027We wouldn\u0027t fancy that, no.\u0027 \u0027Hah!\u0027 Gogosu snorted. \u0027Fair-weather climbers! But in fact the weather is fair. Too damned warm for me! There\u0027d be no problems. A big tin of Hungarian sausages in brine - they come in cheap from across the border - a loaf of black bread, a cheap bottle of plum brandy and a few beers. What? ... a night under the stars in the lee of the crags, with a campfire burning red and the smell of resin coming up off the pines, would do you three the world of good. Your lungs would think they\u0027d died and gone to lung heaven!\u0027 He made it sound good. \u0027We\u0027ll see,\u0027 said Vulpe. \u0027Meanwhile, we\u0027ll pay you half now and the rest when we see these ruins you\u0027ve promised us.\u0027 He took out a bundle of leu and counted off the notes - probably more money than Gogosu would normally see in a month, but very little to him and his companions -then topped up the hunter\u0027s cupped palms with a pile of copper banis, \u0027shrapnel\u0027 or \u0027scrap metal\u0027 to the three Americans. Gogosu counted it all very carefully and finally tucked it away, tried to keep a straight face but couldn\u0027t hold it. In the end he grinned broadly and smacked his lips. That\u0027ll keep me in brandy for a while,\u0027 he said. And more hurriedly: \u0027A short while, you understand.\u0027 Vulpe nodded knowingly: \u0027Oh, yes, I understand,\u0027 and smiled as he settled back in his half of the seat. From behind, the strident, excited voices of Armstrong and Laverne grew loud to compensate for the rumble and clatter of the bus; in front an old woman sat with a huge wire cage of squabbling chicks in her lap; a pair of hulking young farmers were hunched on the other side of the central aisle, discussing fowl-pest or some such and arguing over a decades-browned copy of Romanian Farming Life. There was a family group in the rear of the bus - all very smart, incongruous, uncomfortable and odd-looking in almost-modern suits and dresses - possibly on their way to a wedding or reunion or whatever. To Vulpe\u0027s American companions it must all seem very weird and wonderful, but to Gheorghe �C to George - himself it was... like home. Like coming home, yes. And yet as well as poignant it was also puzzling. He\u0027d felt it ever since they got off the plane a fortnight ago, something he\u0027d thought burned out of him in the fifteen long years since his doctor had taken him to America and come back without him. He\u0027d wanted it to be burned out, too, that bitterness which had come with being orphaned. For in those first years in America he had hated Romania and couldn\u0027t even be reminded of his origins without retreating into black depression. It was one of the reasons he\u0027d come back now, he supposed: to be able to shrug off the shroud of the place and finally say, \u0027There was nothing here for them... nothing here for me ... I escaped!\u0027 In short he had expected the place, the entire country, to depress him and make him bitter all over again - but for the last time - and that afterwards he really would be free of it, glad that it was gone and finally forgotten. He had felt that he\u0027d be able to get down out of that plane, look around and shrug and say to himself: \u0027Who needs it?\u0027 But he\u0027d been wrong. What pain there\u0027d been had quickly drained away; instead of feeling alienated it was as if Romania had at once taken hold of him and told him: \u0027You were a part of this. You were part of the blood of this ancient land. Your roots are here. You know this place, and it knows you!\u0027 Especially here on these dusty roads and tracks under the mountains, these lanes and forest ways and high passes, these valleys and crags and forbidding desolations of sky-piercing rock. These dark woods and rearing aeries. Such places were in his blood, yes. If he listened hard enough he could hear them surging there like a tide on a distant shore, calling to him. Something was calling to him, certainly... \u0027Tell me again,\u0027 said Gogosu, digging him in the ribs. Vulpe started and was back in the bus, drawn down from his flight of fancy. If that\u0027s what it had been. \u0027What? Tell you what?\u0027 \u0027Why you\u0027re here. What it\u0027s all about. I mean, I\u0027m damned if I can understand you vampire-fanciers!\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Vulpe, shaking his head, \u0027that\u0027s why they are here.\u0027 He tilted his head back, indicating the two in the seats behind. \u0027But it\u0027s only one of my reasons. Actually... well, I suppose I really wanted to know where I was born. I mean, I lived in Craiova as a boy, but that\u0027s not the same as being under the mountains. But up here... I guess this is it. And now I\u0027ve seen it and I\u0027m satisfied. I know what it\u0027s about and what I\u0027m about. I can go away now and not worry about it any more.\u0027 The other reason you\u0027re here, then,\u0027 the hunter insisted. \u0027This thing about ruined castles and what all.\u0027 Vulpe shrugged, sighed, then gave it his best shot: \u0027It has to do with romance. Now that\u0027s something you should understand easily enough, Emil Gogosu. What, you? A Romanian? Speaking a Romance language, in a land as full of romance as this one? Oh, I don\u0027t mean the romance of boy and girl -1 mean more the romance of mystery, of history, of myths and legends. The shiver in our spines when we consider our past, when we wonder who we were and where we came from. The mystery of the stars, worlds beyond our ken, places the imagination knows but can\u0027t name or conjure except from old books or scraps of mouldering maps. Like when you suddenly remembered the name of your castle. \u0027It\u0027s the romance of tracking down legends, and it infects people like a fever. Scientists go to the Himalayas to seek the Yeti, or hunt for Bigfoot in the North American woods. There\u0027s a lake in Scotland - do you know where I mean? - where every year they sweep the deep water with echo-sounders as they seek evidence of a survivor out of time. \u0027It\u0027s the fascination in a fossil, the proof that the world was here and that creatures lived in it before we did. It\u0027s this love man has for tracking things down, for leaving no stone unturned, for chipping away at coincidence until it\u0027s seen that nothing is accidental and everything has not only a cause but a result. It\u0027s a synchronicity of soul. It\u0027s the mystique of stumbling across the unknown and making it known, of being the first to make a connection. \u0027Scientists study the fossil remains of a fish believed to be extinct for sixty million years, and pretty soon discover that the same species is still being fished today in the deep waters off Madagascar! When people got interested in the fictional Dracula they were astonished to discover there\u0027d been a real-life Vlad the Impaler... and they wanted to know more about him. Why, he might well have been forgotten except that an author - whether intentionally or otherwise - gave him life. And now we know more about him than ever. \u0027In England in the 6th Century there might have been a King Arthur - and people are still looking for him today! Searching harder than ever for him. And it\u0027s possible he was just a legend. \u0027Right now in America - right across the world, in fact - there are societies dedicated to researching just such mysteries. Me, Armstrong and Laverne, we\u0027re members of one of these groups. Our heroes are the old-time writers of books of horror whose like you don\u0027t much find these days, people who felt a sense of wonder and tried to transfer it to others through their writing. \u0027Well, fifty years ago there was an American author who wrote a novel of dark mystery. In it he mentioned a Transylvanian castle, which he called the Castle Ferenczy. According to the story the castle was destroyed by unnatural forces in the late 1920s. My friends and I came out here to see if we could find just such a pile. And now you tell us it\u0027s real and you can actually show us the tumbled boulders. It\u0027s a perfect example of the kind of synchronicity I\u0027ve been talking about. \u0027But if you\u0027ve romance in your soul... well, perhaps it\u0027s more than just that. Oh, we know that the name Ferenczy isn\u0027t uncommon in these parts. There are echoes from the past; we know there were Boyars in Hungary, Wallachia and Moldavia with the name of Ferenczy. We\u0027ve done a little research, you see? But to have found you was ... it was marvellous! And even if your castle isn\u0027t really what we expect, still it will have been marvellous. And what a story we\u0027ll have to tell our society when we all meet up again back home, eh?\u0027 Gogosu scratched his head, offered a blank stare. \u0027You understand?\u0027 \u0027Not a word,\u0027 said the old hunter. Vulpe sighed deeply, leaned back and closed his eyes. It was obvious he\u0027d been wasting his time. Also, he hadn\u0027t slept too well last night and believed he might try snatching forty winks on the bus. \u0027Well, don\u0027t worry about it,\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027Oh, I won\u0027t!\u0027 Gogosu was emphatic. \u0027Romance? I\u0027m done with all that. I\u0027ve had my share and finished with it. What? Long-legged girls with their wobbly breasts? Hah! The evil old blood-sucking Moroi in their gloomy castles can take the lot of \u0027em for all I care!\u0027 Vulpe began to breathe deeply and said, \u0027Umm...\u0027 \u0027Eh?\u0027 Gogosu looked at him. But already the young American was asleep. Or appeared to be. Gogosu snorted and looked away. Vulpe opened one eye a crack and saw the old hunter settle down, then closed it again, relaxed, let his mind wander. And in a little while he really was asleep... The journey passed quickly for George Vulpe. He spent most of it oblivious to the outside world, locked in the land of his dreams... strange dreams, in the main, which were forgotten on the instant he opened his eyes in those several places where the journey was broken. And the closer he drew to his destination, the stranger his dreams became; surreal, as dreams usually are, still they seemed paradoxically \u0027real\u0027. Which was even more odd, for they were not visual but entirely aural. It had been Vulpe\u0027s thought that the land itself called to him, and in the back of his sleeping mind that idea remained uppermost; except that now it was not so much Romania as a whole (or Transylvania in its own right) which was doing the calling but a definite location, a specific genius loci. The source of that mental attraction was Gogosu\u0027s promised castle, of course, which now seemed provisioned with a dark and guttural (and eager?) voice of its own: I know you are near, blood of my blood, flesh of my flesh, child of my children. I wait as I have waited out the centuries, feeling the brooding mountains closing me in. But... there is now a light in my darkness. A quarter-century and more gone by since first that candle flickered into being; it came when you were born, and it strengthened as you grew. But then... I knew despair. The candle was withdrawn afar; its light diminished; it dwindled to a distant sputtering speck and was extinguished. I thought your flame dead! Or perhaps... not put out but merely placed beyond my reach? And so I put myself to the effort, reached out in search of you, and found you faintly gleaming in a distant land - or so it was my fond preference to believe. But I could not be sure, and so I waited again. Ah! It\u0027s easy to wait when you\u0027re dead, my son, and all hope flown. Why, there\u0027s precious little else to do! But harder when you\u0027re undead and trapped between the pulsing tumult of the living and the vacuous silence of a shunned and dishonoured grave, tenant neither of one nor the other, denied the glory of your own legend; aye, even denied your rightful place in the nightmares of men... For then the mind becomes a clock which ticks away all the lonely hours, and one must learn to modulate the pendulum lest it go out of kilter. Oh, indeed, for the mind is finely balanced. Only let it race and it will soon shake itself to shards, and in the end wind down to madness. And yes, I have known that terror: that I should go mad in my loneliness, and in so doing forsake forever all dreams of resurrection, all hope of... of being, as once I was. Ah! Have I frightened you? Do I sense a shrinking? But no, this must not be! An ancestor, a grandfather... nay, your very father is what I am! That selfsame blood which runs in your veins once ran in mine. It is the river of life\u0027s continuity. There can be no gulf- except perhaps the gulf of ages flown - between such as you and I. Why, we might even be as one! Oh, yes! And indeed - we - shall - be ... friends, you\u0027ll see. \u0027Friends... with a place?\u0027 Vulpe mumbled in his sleep. \u0027Friends with ... the spirit of a place?\u0027 The spirit of...? Ah! I see! You think that I\u0027m an echo from the past! A page of history torn forever from the books by timorous men. A dark rune scored through, defaced from the marble menhir of legends and scattered as dust - because it wasn\u0027t pretty. The Ferenczy is gone and his bones are crumbled away; his ghost walks impotent amid the scattered ruins, the vastly tumbled masonry of his castle. The king is dead - long live the king! Hah! You cannot conceive that I am, that I... remain! That I sleep like you and only require awakening. \u0027You\u0027re a dream,\u0027 said Vulpe. \u0027I\u0027m the one who needs waking up!\u0027 \u0027A dream? Oh, yes! Oh, ha-haa! A dream which reached out across the world to draw you home at last. A powerful dream, that, my son - which may soon become reality, Gheorrrghe... \u0027Gheorghe!\u0027 Emil Gogosu elbowed him roughly. \u0027God, what a man for sleeping!\u0027 \u0027George!\u0027 Seth Armstrong and Randy Laverne finally shook him awake. \u0027Jesus, you\u0027ve slept most of the day!\u0027 \u0027What? Eh?\u0027 Vulpe\u0027s dream receded like a wave, leaving him stranded in the waking world. Just as well, for he\u0027d feared it was beginning to suck him under. He\u0027d been talking to someone, he remembered that much, and it had all seemed very real. And yet now ... he couldn\u0027t even be sure what it had been about. He shook his head and licked his lips, which were very dry. \u0027Where are we?\u0027 \u0027Almost there, pal,\u0027 said Armstrong. \u0027Which is why we woke you up. You sure you\u0027re OK? You haven\u0027t got a fever or something? Some local bug?\u0027 Vulpe shook his head again, this time in denial. \u0027No, I\u0027m OK. Just catching up on a load of missed sleep, I suppose. And a bit disorientated as a result.\u0027 Memories came flooding in: of catching a train in Lipova, hitching a ride on the back of a broken-down truck to Sebis, paying a few extra bani to loll on a pile of hay in a wooden-wheeled, donkey-hauled cart straight out of the dark ages, en route for Halmagiu. And now: \u0027Our driver\u0027s going thataway,\u0027 said Laverne, pointing along a track through the trees. \u0027To Virfurileo, home and the end of the line for him. And Halmagiu\u0027s thataway,\u0027 he pointed along a second track. \u0027Seven or eight kilometres, that\u0027s all,\u0027 said Gogosu. \u0027Depending on how fast you\u0027re all willing to crack along, we could be there in an hour. And plenty of time left over to shake off the dust, eat a meal, moisten our throats a bit and climb a mountain before nightfall - if you\u0027re up to it. Or we could take our food with us, make camp, eat and sleep in the ruins. And how would that be for a story to take back home to America, eh? Anyway, it\u0027s up to you.\u0027 They brushed straw from their clothes, climbed into their packs and waved the driver of the cart farewell as he creaked from sight around a bend in the forest track. And then they too got underway. Randy Laverne uncapped a bottle of beer, took a swig and passed it to Vulpe, who used it to wash his mouth out. \u0027Almost there,\u0027 Armstrong sighed, gangling along pace for pace with the sprightly Gogosu. \u0027And if this place is half of what it\u0027s cracked up to be...\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure it will be,\u0027 said Vulpe, quietly. And he frowned, for in fact he really was sure it would be. \u0027Well, we\u0027ll know soon enough, George,\u0027 said Laverne, his short legs hurrying to keep up. And from some secret cave in the back of Vulpe\u0027s mind: Oh, yes. Soon now, my son. Soon now, Gheorrrghe... At something less than five miles, the last leg of their journey wasn\u0027t much at all; in the previous week the Americans had trekked close to twenty times that distance. They got into Halmagiu in the middle of the afternoon, found lodgings for the following night (not for tonight because Gogosu had already talked them into spending it on the mountain), washed up, changed their footwear, and had a snack alfresco on the open wooden balcony of their guesthouse where it overlooked the village\u0027s main street. \u0027What you have to remember,\u0027 their guide had told them in an aside as they negotiated the price of their rooms, \u0027is that these people are peasants. They\u0027re not sophisticated like me and used to the ways of foreigners, city-dwellers and other weird types. They\u0027re more primitive, suspicious, superstitious! So let me do the talking. You\u0027re climbers, that\u0027s all. No, not even that, you\u0027re... ramblers! And we\u0027re not going walking up in the Zarun-dului but the Metalici.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s the difference?\u0027 Vulpe asked him later, when they were eating. \u0027Between the Zarundului and the Metalici, I mean?\u0027 The old hunter pointed north-west over the rooftops, to a serrated jaw of smoky peaks, gold-rimmed with sunlight. \u0027Them\u0027s the Metalici,\u0027 he said. \u0027The Zarundului are behind us. They\u0027re grey... always. Grey-green in the spring, grey-brown in the autumn, grey in the winter. And white, of course. The castle is right up on the tree line, backed up to a cliff. Aye, a cliff at its back and a gorge at its front. A keep, a stronghold. In the old days, one hell of a place to crack!\u0027 \u0027I meant,\u0027 Vulpe was patient, \u0027why shouldn\u0027t the locals know we\u0027re going there?\u0027 Gogosu wriggled uncomfortably. \u0027Superstitious, like I said. They call those heights the \"Szgany Mountains\", because the travelling folk are so respectful of them. The locals don\u0027t go climbing up there themselves, and they probably wouldn\u0027t like us doing it, neither.\u0027 \u0027Because of the ruins?\u0027 Again Gogosu wriggled. \u0027Can\u0027t say, don\u0027t know, don\u0027t much care. But a couple of winters ago when I tried to shoot an old wolf up there... why, these people treated me like a leper! There are foxes in the foothills that raid the farms, but they won\u0027t hunt or trap \u0027em. They\u0027re funny that way, that\u0027s all. The grandfathers tell ghost stories to keep the young \u0027uns away, you know? The old wampir in his castle?\u0027 \u0027But they\u0027ll see us headed that way, surely?\u0027 \u0027No, for we\u0027ll skirt round.\u0027 Vulpe was wary. \u0027I mean, we\u0027re not moving onto government property or something, are we? There isn\u0027t a military training area or anything like that up there, is there?\u0027 \u0027Lord, no!\u0027 Gogosu was getting annoyed now. \u0027It\u0027s like I said: stupid superstition, that\u0027s all. You have to remember: if a young \u0027un dies up here, and no simple explanation for it, they still put a clove of garlic in his mouth before they nail the lid down on him! Aye, and sometimes they do a lot more than that, too! So leave it be before you get me frightening myself, right?\u0027 Seth Armstrong spoke up: \u0027I keep hearing this word Szgany. What\u0027s it mean?\u0027 Gogosu didn\u0027t need an interpreter for that one. He turned to Armstrong and in broken English said, \u0027In the Germany is \"Zigeuner\", da? Here is Szgany. The road-peoples.\u0027 \u0027Gypsies,\u0027 said Vulpe, nodding. \u0027My kind of people.\u0027 He turned and looked back into the dusty yellow interior of the inn\u0027s upper levels, looked into the rooms, across the stairwell and out through the rear wall. It was as if his gaze was unrestricted by the matter of the inn. Tilting his head back he \u0027looked\u0027 at the grey, unseen mountains of the Zarundului where they reared just a few miles away, and pictured them frowning back at him. And thought to himself: Maybe the locals are right and there are places men shouldn\u0027t go. And unheard (except perhaps as an expression of his own will, his own intent, which it was not) a chuckling, secretive, dark and sinister voice answered him: Oh, there are, my son. But you will, Gheorrrghe, you will... The climb was easy at first. Almost 5.00 p.m. and the sun descending steadily towards the misted valley floor betwen Mount Codrului and the western extremity of the Zarandului range; but Gogosu was confident that they\u0027d reach the ruins before twilight, find a place to camp inside a broken wall, get a fire going, eat and eventually sleep there in the lee of legends. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t do it on my own,\u0027 he admitted, picking his way up a stepped ridge towards a chimney in a crumbling buttress of cliff. \u0027Lord, no! But four of us, hale and hearty? What\u0027s to fear?\u0027 Vulpe, the last in line, paused to translate and look around. The others couldn\u0027t see it but his expression was puzzled. He seemed to recognize this place. Deja vu? He let his companions draw away from him. Armstrong, directly behind their guide, asked: \u0027Well, and what is there to fear?\u0027 He reached back to give Laverne a hand where he puffed and panted. \u0027Only one\u0027s own imagination,\u0027 said Gogosu, understanding the question from its modulation. \u0027For it\u0027s all too ready to conjure not only warrior-ghosts out of the past but a whole heap of mundane menaces from the present, too! Aye, the mind of man\u0027s a powerful force when he\u0027s on his own; there\u0027s plenty of scope up ahead for wild imaginings, I can tell you. But apart from that ... in the winter you might observe the occasional wolf, wandering down here from the northern Carpatii.\u0027 His tone of voice contained a careless shrug. \u0027They\u0027re safe enough, the Grey Ones, except in packs.\u0027 The old hunter paused at the base of the chimney, turning to see how the others were progressing where they laboured in his tracks. But Vulpe had skirted the ridge and was moving along the base of the cliffs to a point where they cut back out of sight around a corner. \u0027Oh?\u0027 the old hunter hailed him. \u0027And where are you off to, then, Gheorghe?\u0027 The young American looked up and back. His face was pale in the shadow of the cliff and his forehead furrowed in a frown of concentration. \u0027You\u0027re making hard work of it, my friend,\u0027 he called out, his voice echoing from crag to crag. \u0027Why climb when you can walk, eh? There\u0027s an old track here that\u0027s simplicity itself to follow. The way may be longer but it\u0027s faster, too - and a sight kinder to your hands and knees! I\u0027ll meet you where your route and mine come together again half-way up.\u0027 \u0027Where our routes - ?\u0027 Gogosu was baffled at first, then annoyed and not a little sarcastic. \u0027Oh, I see!\u0027 he yelled. \u0027And you\u0027ve been this way before, eh?\u0027 But Vulpe had already turned into the re-entry and out of sight. \u0027No,\u0027 his voice came echoing. \u0027It\u0027s just instinct, I suppose.\u0027 \u0027Huh!\u0027 Gogosu snorted. \u0027Instinct!\u0027 But then, as he started in to tackle the chimney, he gave a chuckle. \u0027Oh, let him go,\u0027 he said. \u0027He\u0027ll double back soon enough, when the track runs out and the shadows start to creep. Mark my words, it won\u0027t be long before he\u0027s seeing wolves in every shrub - and by God, how he\u0027ll hurry to catch up then!\u0027 But he was wrong. An hour later when the way was steeper and the light beginning to fail, they reached the broad ledge of a false plateau and found Vulpe stretched out, chewing on a twig, waiting for them. He\u0027d been there some time, it seemed. He nodded when he saw them, said: \u0027The rest of the way\u0027s easy.\u0027 Gogosu scowled and Anderson merely returned Vulpe\u0027s nod, but Laverne was hot and angry. Taking a bit of a chance there, weren\u0027t you, George?\u0027 he growled. \u0027What if you\u0027d got lost?\u0027 Vulpe seemed surprised by the testiness in his friend\u0027s voice. \u0027Lost? I ... I didn\u0027t even consider it. Fact is, I seem to be something of a natural at this sort of thing.\u0027 Nothing more was said and they all rested for a few minutes. Then Gogosu stood up. \u0027Well,\u0027 he said, \u0027half an hour more and we\u0027re there.\u0027 He bowed stiffly to Vulpe from the waist and added: \u0027If you\u0027d care to lead the way... ?\u0027 His sarcasm was wasted; Vulpe took the lead and made easy going of the final climb; they reached the penultimate crest just as the sun sank down behind the western range. The view was wonderful: blue-grey valleys brimming with mist, and the mountains rising out of it, and smoke from the villages smudging the sky where the distant peaks faded from gold to grey. The four men stood on the rim of a pine-clad saddle or shallow fold between marching rows of peaks. Gogosu pointed. \u0027Along there,\u0027 he said. \u0027We follow the rising ground through the trees until we hit the gorge. There, where the mountain is split, set back against the cliff -\u0027 \u0027The ruins of the Ferenczy\u0027s castle,\u0027 Vulpe anticipated him. The hunter nodded. \u0027And just enough light to settle in and get a fire going against the fall of night. Are we all ready, then?\u0027 But George Vulpe was already leading the way. As they went, the eerie cry of a wolf came drifting on the resin-laden air, gradually fading into mournful ululations. \u0027Damn me!\u0027 Gogosu cursed as he stumbled to a halt. He cocked his head on one side, sniffed at the air, listened intently. But there was no repeat performance. Unslinging his rifle from behind his back, he said: \u0027Did you hear that? And can you credit it?
