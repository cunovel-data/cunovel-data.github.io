Mac would have said it out loud if he thought it would help.\n He turned his head over, fighting the sick waves of pain rolling over him from the lashing. Violet stood at the entrance to the dungeon in casual street clothes.\n \"You\u0027re not dressed for the occasion,\" Kiera said, her gaze and the gun swinging toward Violet as his pixie made her way, one casual step at a time, down the stairs.\n \"I had thought to change upstairs, but I wanted to come down here and see what I was missing. Apparently, quite a lot.\"\n \"You stop right at the bottom, and you keep your hands where I can see them. You ruined it, Mac,\" Kiera said, though she never took her eyes off of Violet. \"If you hadn\u0027t made me pull the gun, we could have had some fun first.\n \"I want you to take off your clothes,\" she told Violet. \"Strip down to your underwear, so I can be sure you\u0027re not carrying anything, and move slowly. I hate to order a Mistress, but I\u0027ve got to see this through, you see?\" She backed up as Violet reached the bottom of the stairs, keeping the gun trained on the smaller woman at chest level. That fragile network of curves, flesh and muscle, the vital organs beneath. Panic gripped Mac, caught him up as it hadn\u0027t since he was an unarmed rookie in the middle of a domestic fight, a baby in a crib two feet away while the drunk father waved a loaded .38 at the teenaged mother. He had managed that. He would manage this. He would not let Kiera kill Violet. It wasn\u0027t going to happen. He made it so in his mind, made it so in his resolve, let it coat him like armor.\n \"There are only the dungeons for us, Violet.\" Kiera\u0027s eyes were expressive, appealing. \"We\u0027re like medieval torturers who can only live with the prisoners, dispensing pain and release, never letting the world above see who we all really are because they can\u0027t bear our truth.\"\n \"Wrong.\" Violet took the final step down. \"I want Mac. In The Zone, out of The Zone. I want to eat dinner with him, watch him shave in the morning, listen to him yell at the political pundits on TV. I want to nag him to mow the yard, and wake up curled up next to him in the early morning.\" Her glance went to Mac, lingered on his back, the hot fury of her reaction piercing through him, though she kept her voice admirably even. \"I want that as much as I want to have him chained for my pleasure in a bedroom.\n I want him to be there for me, with me. I want him to take care of me, and I want to take care of him. Don\u0027t you want that, Mac?\"\n He locked gazes with her. \"Absolutely, sugar.\" For a remarkable second, it was just the two of them in the room, all the danger, blood and restraints gone. Then they came back, as Violet shifted her attention to Kiera.\n \"The dungeon is only one part of it, Kiera, as Mac told you. You had one situation that went bad. You could have found someone else if you hadn\u0027t given up.\"\n \"He won\u0027t accept you that way. He\u0027s a cop. He can\u0027t take you out into the light of a normal relationship.\"\n \"Wrong,\" Mac said. \"I can, and I have.\"\n \"Your shirt,\" Kiera snapped. \"Now.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have to do this,\" Violet said, slowly toeing off her shoes, pulling her shirt out of her waistband of her jeans. \"This can\u0027t end well, Kiera. It\u0027s gotten out of your control.\"\n \"Oh, please,\" Kiera chuckled. \"If there\u0027s anyone who understands the presence or absence of control, it\u0027s Mistresses like us. I\u0027ve been neck deep in the practice of it since I was a teenager. You\u0027re a rank amateur.\"\n \"A Mistress is born, not made,\" Violet returned. \"You\u0027re not a Mistress, Kiera. You never were. You\u0027re your sister\u0027s sub, which makes me the one in the room with the true control. If you give me the gun, it will be over and there won\u0027t be any more hurting.\"\n \"This is the last time I\u0027m going to tell you. Take off your shirt,\" Kiera snapped.\n \"And save your pathetic two-hour class in police psychology.\" Her finger had moved off the guard back to the trigger. Mac heaved against the bench, heard wood groan.\n Kiera shot him a glance. \"Give it up, Mac. This is over. If she hadn\u0027t been a cop, if she hadn\u0027t known, we could have had so much fun with you gagged. I was going to let her play, let her get you and her off one more time. We might even have let Jonathan do you like I promised. You don\u0027t understand. But you will. You\u0027ll understand when I shoot. I\u0027ll see it in your eyes, and we\u0027ll all know I\u0027ve done the right thing. Now, Violet,\" she snarled.\n \"Fine.\" Violet yanked the shirt over her head, pulled it off her arms and flung it into the air between them, a projectile of cloth aimed for Kiera\u0027s face.\n Kiera\u0027s trigger finger jerked, and the gun went off. Eyes locked on the muzzle, Mac saw the gun kick high. She was going to miss. Violet rammed into the taller woman, sending them crashing over a heavy wooden chair, taking it with them in a tangle of arms and legs. The bullet hit the wall as the gun spun away out of Kiera\u0027s hands.\n Violet had police training, but Kiera worked out in a gym regularly and had her in strength and weight. When she rolled to her feet and took a martial arts stance, leaped forward and tackled Violet before she could go for the gun, she demonstrated she\u0027d had contact training as well. The two women made it to their feet. Violet landed a punch, but Kiera knocked her back with a hard kick. Undeterred, his fiery Mistress rolled, rammed forward, slamming them against Jonathan\u0027s cross. Powell grabbed a generous handful of Kiera\u0027s hair, and she screamed, turning on him as Violet yanked a gun out of an ankle holster.\n Kiera shoved her elbow into Powell\u0027s stomach, gaining her release, and flung herself on Violet before she could get the gun up. She rolled Violet over with another hard kick to her mid-section, taking her wind and making her drop the gun. Violet spun and grabbed her, and they went over Mac, tumbling to the other side of him. Violet landed on the bottom, her head hitting the wall. Kiera struck her, rolled off and scrabbled away.\n When they rolled over, the bench groaned, and the significance of that exploded in Mac\u0027s mind. As Kiera scrabbled for the gun and Violet tried to orient herself, he heaved against the bench. Not up and back this time. Left, then right, left, then right.\n The anchoring had been designed for the pull of an aroused sub, resistance anticipated forward and back. He snarled, heaved again, side to side, fast as the pumping of a piston, every muscle screaming, demanding release, despite the awkward positioning of his legs. The floorboard cracked, twisted.\n He roared, using the sound to galvanize him to further action. The floor ripped in response. The right side of the bench came loose abruptly, unbalancing him. Mac rolled with it, using the momentum to tear the bench free and coming to his feet, face to face with Kiera, who had just claimed the gun and leveled it at Violet. The roll put him squarely in the middle of them. He kept going, a forward charge, the bench anchored to his front like a Roman wooden shield.\n Violet screamed his name. The gun fired. Kiera shrieked as he took her down under him. One wooden leg drove into her left breast, the other under her right arm. The impact to the breast caused a scream of pain. Still manacled to the bench, he had no mobility in his hands, and she still had the gun, but then Violet was there, stomping on her wrist, knocking it away, while Kiera abandoned all training and went after his face with teeth and nails.\n \"Roll off,\" Violet shouted. Mac obeyed slowly, fighting through a haze of pain roaring through his body as if his insides were on fire, but his sense of self-preservation galvanized him to get him away from those wicked nails. Violet swung down with the P99 and clipped Kiera\u0027s temple, stunning her, but the woman lunged forward nevertheless.\n \"Watch your feet,\" he managed hoarsely, but it was too late.\n Kiera caught Violet\u0027s ankle, yanked, making her land with a heavy thud on her back. Violet\u0027s foot caught her squarely in the mouth, snapping her head back, and then Mac was back on her, adrenaline filling in as his body weakened. He aimed better this time. When he landed, the four-by-four solid polished leg of the bench went directly into Kiera\u0027s face, caving in her skull with a sickening crunch.\n There was no finesse to it, nothing but clear, brute strength, messy and final. Kiera\u0027s body went slack. Mac closed his eyes as the burning in his back merged with the burning in his gut. God, he was going to throw up after all.\n \"Let me out of here!\" Powell screamed.\n \"Shut up,\" Violet snarled, not bothering to look at him while she freed Mac from his manacles and chains and moved him off the mangled bench onto his back. Onto blissfully cool tile that gave him a second\u0027s respite from the fire in his gut.\n \"Mac. Oh, Mac.\"\n Fuck. He hurt. His hands automatically went to his abdomen, where the bullet had punched through the board and into his body.\n He heard a heavy thud above them and started up, but she slid her arms around him. \"That will be the local police. We\u0027re here!\" she shouted as the footsteps continued above them.\n \"Likely... soundproof,\" he reminded her.\n She bounced up, loosed Jonathan with three quick jerks, threw a robe at him. He caught it automatically, but before he could bolt, she caught his cock barehanded and twisted hard enough to turn him white, a maneuver Mac remembered had been very effective on him.\n \"You go up and show them how to get down here. Tell them we have an officer down and we need EMTs now. Right now, you\u0027re just an idiot on a questionable kidnapping charge. You run, and I\u0027ll have you marked on the attempted murder of two cops, you got me? I\u0027ll make sure you get a prison cell with the meanest son of a bitch Master you\u0027ve ever met in your life, whose idea of a bedtime lullaby each night is making you scream in pain.\"\n Powell bolted for the stairs, but she was already kneeling by Mac again. He was covered in something wet. His own sweat, he realized, though he was trembling uncontrollably. The pain was enormous, sick waves of it.\n \"Afraid you\u0027re not seeing me at my best,\" he said, through clenched teeth.\n Her eyes darkened, \"Jesus, Mac, if this isn\u0027t your best, I\u0027ll be overwhelmed when I finally do see it. You took a bullet for me, you jerk.\"\n \"Can\u0027t...couldn\u0027t...have to protect you. Keep you.\" Her hands were light, like the touch of angel wings on his flesh. \"Sorry I involved you...but you did it.\"\n \"We did it, Mac. Mac...Mackenzie,\" she snapped sharply.\n He pulled himself out of the pleasant white haze enveloping him.\n \"Mackenzie.\" She was very close to him now, her lips just above his. She had the most beautiful eyes, even when they narrowed as they did now, telling him she meant business, and there\u0027d be hell to pay if she wasn\u0027t obeyed. \"I absolutely forbid you to die.\n Do you hear me?\"\n \"Yes...Mistress.\"\n \"So all that sappy stuff you agreed to, about wanting to be with me forever, letting me nag you, you just said that to buy us time and save your ass, right?\" He managed a smile. \"You bet.\"\n She eased her hand under his shoulder, trying to avoid the torn flesh from the scourging, but Violet could tell all his focus was on the lethal agony in his midsection.\n He didn\u0027t even flinch when her fingernails accidentally caught in a welt, reopened a half clotted wound on his shoulder.\n \"Oh, Mac.\"\n \"You shouldn\u0027t...have come. Could have killed you.\"\n \"Don\u0027t make me slap you around in your current condition,\" she said, trying to keep her voice steady, though fury and fear were pumping through her in equal measures. \"You\u0027d be dead, she\u0027d be gone and we\u0027d have had to run her down before she got someone else. I was at my mother\u0027s late, didn\u0027t start here until about 7:30 because I couldn\u0027t raise Tyler on the phone.\"\n Had almost not checked her messages, God help her. She kept talking, knowing he wasn\u0027t hearing half of it, but hoping he could hold onto her voice like a lifeline. \"I knew he had left for his tour, so I figured T\u0026K were in the dungeons with you, waiting on me like he said. Though I couldn\u0027t understand for the life of me why you would have agreed to go alone with them without waiting for me, unless...\" her voice caught. \"I thought you set it up as some sort of surprise for me. To make me feel better.\"\n \"Not brave enough...for that. They...twins...always scared the shit out of me.\" She fought tears with the smile. \"I was pulling up the driveway at about five after nine when your sergeant called me, said you hadn\u0027t reported in. I figured something was up. Mac. Mac!\"\n \"Wh - What?\" He blinked his eyes back open, but the pupils were dilated, no focus.\n Where the hell were the EMTs? She put her hand over his, over the wound, let him feel her touch over the source of his pain. \"Mackenzie, I mean it. You\u0027re going to obey me, because you\u0027ve told me over and over there\u0027s nothing you\u0027ll refuse me. You understand? I don\u0027t care how much you hurt, you will not wimp out on me. You hear me? Mac?\" She shouted it, and he jerked.\n His silver eyes focused on her for the barest fraction of a moment, enough that she saw he acknowledged her words, lingered on her face in a way that made the tears win, roll down her cheeks. His hand brushed her leg, rested on her thigh. \"Yes, Mistress,\" he repeated. Then he lost consciousness.\n They airlifted him to Tampa General. When the copter touched down on the pad, Violet jumped down, a step ahead of the gurney. She stayed out of the way, but refused to be pushed back as the EMTs ran Mac across the ground to the ER doors. Nurses and a doctor burst out, sprinted to meet them, falling in with the rapid procession headed through the double doors to the prep area.\n The doctor was young, reminding her this was one of Tampa\u0027s teaching hospitals, but she was reassured by his quick fire of orders to place an emergency call for the surgeon on duty. He tapped the bracelet on Mac\u0027s wrist. \"Get this off of him and get him ready for Dr. Hilaman.\"\n \"We\u0027ll need to cut it off,\" the EMT responded. \"It\u0027s got a key lock.\"\n \"No,\" Violet shouldered forward, yanked the key from the thin silver chain around her neck, snapping it. \"I\u0027ve got it.\"\n They gave her room, and she didn\u0027t waste time, lifting his wrist and fitting the key to the discreet locking mechanism. Mac twisted his hand away, bringing up the other hand to fend her off. Even unconscious, he didn\u0027t want her to take it.\n The emotional reaction overwhelmed her, made her vision gray around the edges, the fear of losing him rushing into that vulnerable opening he\u0027d torn in her heart. But she kept it together, leaned over him, shoving the nurse off her. \"I\u0027ve got it, baby,\" she whispered. \"It\u0027s me. Let me take care of it.\"\n She felt the speculative looks of the medical personnel around her, but then Mac\u0027s grip slackened and she had the bracelet in her hand.\n \"You\u0027re going to have to stay out here, sugar.\" The big black nurse was nudging her back with kind but determined intent. \"Go give his information to the ER desk.\n That\u0027s how you can help now.\"\n \"Don\u0027t call me that,\" Violet said, her voice trembling. But the nurse was already gone, behind swinging gray doors that sealed Mac away from her.\n \"I need to speak to a member of Detective Nighthorse\u0027s family.\" With his thinning hair and unfashionably plain black frame glasses, Dr. Hilaman looked more like a computer nerd than a surgeon, unless one looked through the lenses of those glasses and saw the hard, direct look to his eyes. They swept the waiting room, took stock of all the police waiting there.\n \"You\u0027re looking at them,\" Darla said quietly. \"Mac doesn\u0027t have any living family, doctor. I\u0027m Sergeant Darla Rowe, his boss. I signed the surgical waiver. And this is Violet Siemanski. She\u0027s his...\" She looked toward Violet, standing next to her.\n \"I\u0027m his,\" Violet said simply. \"Is he... has he...\" She couldn\u0027t force herself to finish it, not without a hint of hope visible in Dr. Hilaman\u0027s countenance.\n It had been eight hours since Mac had disappeared into the surgery. She felt Darla\u0027s frozen stillness beside her, of those behind them. His immediate coworkers, Detectives Consuela \"Connie\" Ramsey and Martin Suarez, and a waiting room full of cops. It seemed like Mac\u0027s entire squad had emptied out to share the vigil. As if by being present, they could convince Fate to swing in the fallen man\u0027s favor.\n \"No,\" Dr. Hilaman said, but there was no easing of his expression, no reassurance of any kind to be found there. He studied them, his gaze shifting between Violet\u0027s face and Darla Rowe. \"I\u0027ll talk to the two of you, then, privately, about his condition. If you\u0027ll follow me.\"\n Violet walked at Darla\u0027s side, not looking at her, not doing anything but focusing on Dr. Hilaman\u0027s back and putting one foot in front of the other. She didn\u0027t want to hear his prognosis. She had a sudden, desperate and irrational thought that if she didn\u0027t hear it, her will alone could make him survive this night.\n Stop it, Violet. He needs you. Don\u0027t lose it now.\n She remembered the night Mac had held her in the tub, after the shooting. How he had kept the demons from taking her over. Well, she owed him the same. She\u0027d hear Dr. Hilaman describe them, and then figure out how to put herself between Mac and whatever threatened him, drive them off and keep him with her.\n Instead of taking them into one of the small anterooms, Dr. Hilaman took them down a hallway closer to the surgery, into an X-ray room, dim except for the series of films placed up on display on the lighted view screens. Dr. Hilaman stopped on the other side of them, leveled his somber eyes on Sergeant Rowe. \"I know I don\u0027t have to tell you that Detective Nighthorse is in extremely serious condition.\"\n \"Violet is a police officer as well, Doctor. We both understand what kind of injury this is.\"\n He nodded. \"All right then.\" He directed their attention to an overlay chart of the human body, pinned up on the wall next to the X-rays. Violet had a difficult time shifting her gaze away from the stark black and white of those X-rays, the shadows and light of Mac\u0027s body, to the garish colors of a cartoon-like depiction.\n \"This is the entry point, through the small intestine. The bullet came in at an angle, and it did significant trauma to the pancreas. The spleen was completely compromised.\n We removed it. The pancreas are a difficult area to work on, because of the spongy quality of the organ, but we were able to stitch it back together. See this vein here?\" He motioned with his pen. \"This is the splenic vein. It\u0027s a tributary into which a number of veins flow from the spleen, pancreas and parts of the stomach. It, too, was badly damaged and had to be repaired, as well as a whole series of smaller arteries.\"\n \"He\u0027s not out of the woods yet.\" Darla spoke in a wooden voice.\n \"Not by a long shot.\" It was clear that Dr. Hilaman had a learned opinion of Mac\u0027s chances, and Violet watched, her tension building, as he measured their capacity to hear it.\n \"You don\u0027t think he\u0027ll make it,\" she said. Her voice wasn\u0027t her own. It was hollow, as if it echoed out of the aching chambers of her heart.\n \"He\u0027s tough, and in good condition, but the overall health of the body has little to do with the prognosis for this kind of injury. The bullet and the debris that it forced into his body - wood splinters, fiber stuffing - they made a mess of one of the most closely knit areas of the human anatomy. The next several days will be critical. If he comes through them, there will still be a long and difficult recovery period. A dangerous one.\n With this type of injury, late complications could arise. Complications that could cause a serious setback, even death.\n \"If he makes it through post-surgery period,\" Dr. Hilaman said steadily, \"he will need home care, a nurse. A long period of recuperation, likely six months or more, time for his body to heal from the trauma.\"\n \"He\u0027ll have whatever he needs,\" Violet said. \"Can I see him? I want to see him.\" Need to see him. Touch him.\n The doctor looked toward Violet. She put everything she could into her expression to convince him. To make him understand that Mac needed her near, that the connection between them, her strength, her presence, was vital.\n \"You may sit with him,\" he said at last. \"And you - \" He turned to Sergeant Rowe.\n \" - You may look in and satisfy yourself that he\u0027s alive and getting the best of care.\n Ordinarily I\u0027d allow no visitors, but I suspect you both would be in there the moment I turn my back.\"\n \"And we are armed,\" Rowe pointed out, without a trace of a smile.\n \"There is that.\"\n Violet sat in the ICU, watching lights blink, listening to machines beep, to soft-soled shoes slap with varying levels of urgency up and down the hall. The stench of antiseptic filled her nostrils. She hated it. Hated the wait.\n Her hand stayed on Mac\u0027s, her fingers tight on his wrist, so every thready pulse beat was answered by the sure sound of her own. Though she didn\u0027t trust the beeps from the machines, she marked every tone of them as well, jumping at the slightest variation.\n The nurse came in as she did every half-hour, laid a hand on her shoulder. \"I\u0027m going to need you to give me a few minutes with him this time, Officer. We need to take some readings. And you need a few minutes\u0027 break. Go get some coffee.\" Violet knew by the tone of the nurse\u0027s voice she would brook no resistance. Since she was allowed here only as long as the nurses passed on good behavior reports to Dr.\n Hilaman, she knew she had to obey.\n Still, she had to set her jaw and firm her resolve for several moments before she could release his hand. The power and virility was leeched from his skin, making him look like he belonged in a coffin. \"I\u0027ll be right back,\" she whispered to him, pressing a quick kiss to his forehead, savoring the taste of his skin, still living, albeit far too cool.\n At the end of the hallway there was a cramped nook with a couple of chairs and a side table with old magazines. Violet assumed it was provided for those, like her, who were temporarily ousted from their loved one\u0027s side for tests or procedures. Darla Rowe sat in one of the chairs. Violet didn\u0027t want coffee, didn\u0027t want to be any farther from Mac than she had to be, so she walked the twenty steps down the tiled hallway and took a seat across from her. \"Are they all still here?\"\n \"Some of them had to go back to work, or home to their families, but they\u0027re taking shifts in the cafeteria on the third floor. I\u0027ve been getting the reports when the nurse comes out, taking that down to them. How\u0027s he look?\" Violet met her gaze. \"He\u0027s still here.\"\n Rowe nodded.\n The two women said very little, but as the moments passed, Violet felt the other woman\u0027s regard become more intent upon her, and the weight of unspoken words building between them. She liked the look of Mac\u0027s boss, and under normal circumstances would have gone out of her way to be nice, but she wasn\u0027t really feeling nice at the moment. Perhaps it was that hostility emanating off of her adding to the rising tension, as much as something similar coming off of Darla Rowe.\n \"I\u0027ve been fortunate,\" the police sergeant said at last, her voice a quiet murmur. \"I haven\u0027t had to do this that often. But when I have, I\u0027ve always wondered how platoon leaders do it in war zones. Watch their men go down, knowing that if they\u0027d done one thing or another, it wouldn\u0027t have happened. Even when you send them out in the line of duty, you still did the sending.\"\n Violet lifted her head. The early afternoon light was coming through the window in the nook, throwing Rowe\u0027s profile into relief. She was hearing a tone of voice she was sure the woman rarely used, because a sergeant couldn\u0027t afford to second guess herself, not with a squad of men and women depending on her confidence. But the quiet of this out-of-the-way part of the ICU against the boiling activity just outside it, the strain of keeping watch here in separate solitude for hour upon hour, left time only for contemplation and bitter hindsight, apparently for both of them. Violet was glad for the distraction, she realized, because her own thoughts were eating her alive.\n \"There were other ways he could have conducted this case,\" Darla mused. \"He was pushing himself to the forefront from the beginning. He said he wasn\u0027t her target victim, but I think he expected to be made by her, so he could make himself her target.\n He didn\u0027t seem at all surprised when she left a note on the last body, telling him he was next.\"\n \"She...what?\"\n \"The bitch addressed it to him.\"\n \"And you didn\u0027t pull him off the case, then?\"\n \"No, I didn\u0027t.\" Darla leaned forward in the chair, propping her elbows on her knees, looked steadily at Violet. \"I trust my people\u0027s judgment, Officer.\" Violet saw her high regard for Mac in her face, heard the pride. \"What I didn\u0027t see, however, was that he was pushing too hard, and he was already tired. He was way overdue for vacation time. I trusted his instincts, but in this case, you\u0027re right, I should have pulled him off the case. He knew what he was doing the whole time, and knew this could happen. It had become too personal.\"\n \"Yes, it had,\" Violet said abruptly. \"He was determined not to have another person\u0027s trust betrayed, their life taken. And you couldn\u0027t have stopped him from trying, exactly because it was so personal.\" She was furious, knowing Mac had taken the risk, but she understood him enough to know he wouldn\u0027t have let it go down any other way. He was that damn stubborn.\n \"Well, I expect he\u0027ll get that vacation now.\" Her voice cracked slightly. She tightened her jaw, looked toward the window.\n \"Yes, he will.\" Darla leaned back in her chair, studying Violet in that way that was starting to get on her nerves, so she turned her head, met the sergeant\u0027s look head on.\n \"Is there a problem?\"\n \"My niece has converted to the Wiccan faith.\"\n Violet blinked. \"Excuse me?\"\n Darla shifted, uncrossed her legs, re-crossed them with the right leg on top this time. \"I\u0027m fond of her, and so of course I did some reading on it. It\u0027s a very alternative type religion, if you\u0027re familiar with it at all?\" Violet nodded, drawing her brow together in confusion.\n \"It attracts some nasty fringe elements, as the road less traveled often will. But at its core, it\u0027s a lovely faith, with principles that draw from...\" A smile touched her lips that Violet did not understand. \"...From natural law. People live in a very unnatural world, Violet. Those who walk outside the lines of that unnatural world, seeking their natural place, the way their instincts call them to be, they often walk a road of high risks for themselves. Doesn\u0027t make them wrong, just a bit braver, or perhaps more foolish, than most of us.\" She let her gaze travel down the hall, toward the open door to Mac\u0027s room.\n \"I don\u0027t claim to understand the path that calls to the two of you, but I do know it\u0027s a hell of a risky lifestyle for two cops.\"\n \"All relationships have risks, Sergeant Rowe,\" Violet said at last, not sure what the woman was after, but giving her the simplest, most honest answer she had.\n \"So they do.\" Darla rose, her expression unreadable. \"I\u0027m going to go make my rounds, see who\u0027s still around, give them a status. What should I tell them?\"\n \"Tell him he\u0027s an oak. And oaks survive what no one else can.\" Darla reached out, closed her hand on Violet\u0027s. Turning her hand over so their palms met, Violet laced her fingers with the sergeant\u0027s, gripped hard. She closed her eyes, unable to bear the emotional connection and eye contact as well. She just squeezed, and Darla squeezed back, a silent communication of what the man twenty feet away meant to both of them.\n Then she pulled away. Violet waited until Darla\u0027s footsteps retreated to raise her lids, which she suspected gave both of them the necessary time to compose themselves.\n Her timing was good, for as she opened her eyes, the nurse came out of the room, nodded at her. No change, a good thing at this point.\n Violet rose, went back to the room. She paused in the doorway a moment, looking at him there. He was such a big man, his feet all the way at the end of the bed, those long arms lying pale and unmoving on the covers. That beautiful chest, the hair she loved completely shaved from it for surgery. But that didn\u0027t matter. Sinking down by his side, gripping his hand again, she imagined that the strength and love she\u0027d felt in Darla Rowe\u0027s touch would soak into him with her own, reinforce the fight going on inside to keep him with them all.\n In the raw clarity that the strain of the past hours had brought to her, Violet knew why she\u0027d been so determined to have him the first time she\u0027d seen him, when she\u0027d sensed he was a cop. A part of her had believed it was a sign, that she\u0027d found the fairy tale, someone who would share her life as well as her bed, someone who understood what she was, who she was. All the corners and rooms. Now, denied his strength, she still wanted him with all her heart, wanted him to live, to be with her, to see if they could make a go of it.\n The mother who had held her son through the night when he first had to take a life had died several years ago. The brother had been killed in the line of duty a decade past. She knew they were here, sitting in this room, helping Mac find his way back to her. His living family was right here. Her fingers tightened on him.\n She was so tired, but she couldn\u0027t close her eyes. Each time she did, she saw it in slow motion, Kiera knocking her on her ass, her head hitting the wall. The struggle to stagger to her feet, her head ringing from the impact. The squeezing panic in her chest, knowing she was going to be too late. She\u0027d thought the terrifying roaring had been in her head, but then Mac had ripped the bench loose by throwing his body to the side and rolled, coming to his feet. That gorgeous mangled broad back shielding her as he charged forward. She\u0027d heard the scream tear from her throat, knew it was not going to stop him. The jerk of his body was the only pause he made, and she saw the bullet punch out of his back, no more than an inch away from his spine, and thud into the wall by her head.\n At the time her mind had shut down, refusing to acknowledge it, because she\u0027d needed all her adrenaline to focus on taking down Kiera. But in the helicopter she had seen it replay over and over in her mind, and waves of terror came with every rewind, until she was praying silently over and over for a miracle, praying for the copter to go faster. Praying to go back in time so she could be faster and make it not happen.\n There was no worse place to be shot. Dr. Hilaman knew it. Every cop knew it. But she believed in Mac more than in medical science. She believed in his indomitable will, which had resisted her so strongly from the first and yet kept him fused to her, despite his fears of accepting his true nature. Knowing the alternative was unthinkable, she had to believe he would survive.\n She knew now that he wanted her as much as she wanted him. At that moment when she had answered Kiera, when her eyes had locked with his, there had been nothing but the truth of their hearts. No time, no shields, nothing but the simple honesty of two lives stripped down to the last breathing moment together.\n \"Mackenzie.\" She laid her cheek on his large hand, rubbing against the coarse hair, the rough knuckles. \"Wake up. I need you so much.\" The tone of the monitor stumbled, made her heart jump three beats. She straightened to glance at the machine. In her peripheral vision, she saw the nurse in her blue scrubs standing in the doorway.\n \"I think it was just a skip,\" Violet said. \"Damn thing keeps scaring the shit out of me, every time it goes irregular.\"\n \"Well, let\u0027s see if we can\u0027t make it a bit more flat line.\" Violet spun.\n It was Tamara, not a nurse, standing in the doorway. Kiera\u0027s sister, composed as a cold statue, leveled a .38 directly at Mac\u0027s chest. Her finger squeezed the trigger.\n It was ten feet to the door. There wasn\u0027t time for Violet to reach for her ankle piece or do anything but throw her body over Mac\u0027s upper torso, curling herself over his chest and head, her own skull an obstacle the bullet would have to shoot through to get to his.\n The first bullet ripped through her shirt at the waist, burning her. Violet flinched at the staccato sounds of shots, her heart hammering so loudly against her chest she couldn\u0027t tell whether it was her own heart making her jerk, or slugs tearing through her flesh. Mac\u0027s hands moved, confused, scrabbling, his subconscious responding to shots the way any conscious cop did, even if he didn\u0027t have the physical ability to protect himself. He found her body, gripped, and she held onto him, kept him covered, unable to move even as she heard shouting, running feet, thuds.\n \"Officer Siemanski! Violet! Violet! Get off him, move off! He\u0027s gone flat line.\" She heard the horrible whine of the monitor, would have wanted to cease living herself at the sound if her hand hadn\u0027t been curled around his throat, feeling his pulse pounding against her fingertips.\n \"No, the unit\u0027s been hit,\" a nurse called out above the din. \"Get a new one in here, stat. Get a cuff on him. Officer, you have to move.\" A variety of voices, calling at her from different directions, the hands of the nurse, then Suarez and Connie, prying her tight fingers off him.\n Pull it together, Siemanski.\n Letting go of Mac was the hardest thing she\u0027d ever done in her life, but she managed it, rolled away, let the doctors and nurses swarm over him.\n Falling back to the wall, she assessed the scene. Sergeant Rowe was checking her weapon, returning her service pistol to her shoulder holster. She stood just beyond Tamara\u0027s body, which was collapsed in the doorway, a macabre sight with nurses and medical personnel stepping hastily back and forth over her while a doctor checked her vitals, confirming that she was dead. Uniforms hovered just behind him, waiting to lift the corpse out of the way. There\u0027d been no time to wound. The sergeant had taken Tamara straight through the chest cavity, twice, and dropped her. Two Styrofoam cups floated in a pool of brown liquid running across the hospital floor, on a direct course to intercept the trail of blood that leaked from Tamara.\n Darla\u0027s gaze met Violet\u0027s. \"Thought you could use some coffee,\" the sergeant said.\n Violet nodded, a jerk of her head. The shock and terror were wearing off, leaving anger. Deep, tear-the-ass-off-the-nearest-fool-willing-to-get-close-enough-to-her anger.\n \"Why wasn\u0027t she being watched?\"\n Consuela Ramsey, standing at Rowe\u0027s side, stiffened at the tone. \"Early this morning, a uniform informed her that her sister had been killed. She told him that she was going to their parents\u0027 place to break the news. She wasn\u0027t a suspect, Officer Siemanski.\"\n \"So someone was careless enough to let her know Mac was here? Did they just pull their heads out of their asses yesterday? And how the hell did a woman who was a dead ringer for the woman who put Mac in this bed walk through a hospital of cops without a single fucking one of them noticing?\"\n \"Officer,\" Rowe said sharply. \"They were in - \"\n \"Why didn\u0027t anyone recognize that she didn\u0027t belong on this floor?\" Violet snarled.\n \"What, Charles Manson could throw on blue scrubs and waltz right through the children\u0027s ward here?\"\n She had started low, vicious, her teeth gritting over the words, but when she finished, she was one step below an enraged scream, bringing a momentary stunned silence to the room, the hallway, and likely to everyone on the entire floor. The doctor on call opened his mouth to snap at her, order her to get the hell out, she was sure, but before he could, someone else spoke.\n \"Singing... Beautiful sound.\"\n She whirled on her heel. Past the arm of the nurse checking his blood pressure, Mac\u0027s eyes were half open, looking at her through a haze of pain and drugs. In them she saw a hint of that frightening distance that people teetering on the edge of life and death had. But they were open.\n Violet circled the nurse, barely managing not to knock her out of the way, and put her hand against his face. \"Mackenzie, you hear singing?\" She groped to change gears, had a terrifying, hysterical thought. \"Do you hear angels?\" She looked around wildly to see if they had him hooked up to a new unit yet, so they could be sure that great heart wasn\u0027t grinding to a halt.\n He made a noise, bringing her attention back to his face. There was something else in his expression, something it took a moment for her to recognize. Amusement.\n Amusement with her. His voice was a broken rumble.\n \"Just one, sugar.\"\n She closed her eyes, put her forehead to his, both hands to his face. She felt his arm move weakly to the edge of the bed, brush against her leg.\n \"What...happened? Shots.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\" She stroked his cheek, bent close so all he could see was her. She felt the press of the medical personnel against her, wanting to get her out of there. But this was important, as important to his survival as anything they were doing.\n \"You just have to rest, and get better, because there\u0027s a lot I want from you, Mackenzie Nighthorse. I\u0027m not going to let you keep your ass in this bed forever.\"\n \"You could...come put your ass in it with me.\"\n Violet brushed her lips lightly over his, nearly broke into tears at the slight pressure of response. The nurse\u0027s touch on her arm had become an insistent clamp. \"Soon, baby.\n But let them take care of you. I\u0027ll be right here.\" He nodded, already slipping off again, but his finger caressed her leg once more. A promise that he\u0027d be back. A promise he would keep, or she\u0027d go yank him out of hell itself.\n Violet moved back to the door as the new monitoring unit was brought in with several more nurses to get him hooked back up. Tamara\u0027s body was being lifted onto a gurney. A clean-up crew was moving in to handle the rest, the coffee and blood, as other staff members shooed the cops who had responded to the shots back toward the elevators. She thought to look down at herself, and discovered the bullet that had passed so close to her side and through the mattress had only burned the upper layer of skin, nothing serious. Glancing back into the room at the wall, she verified that Tamara had only gotten off two shots. The one that had nearly hit them, and then the one that had gone wild, hitting the unit, when apparently Rowe had put the first shot into her back.\n Violet stepped outside of the room, looked down at the bloodstained floor. \"I don\u0027t know whether to scream at you some more or thank you,\" she said at last to Mac\u0027s boss and Connie, both standing on the other side of the grisly puddle.\n Darla put a restraining hand on Consuela\u0027s arm when Mac\u0027s co-worker curled back her lip to snap. \"Easy. We\u0027ve all had a tough day. Detective Ramsey, please go with the body to the morgue, make sure everything is handled by the book.\" Consuela blew out a breath, nodded, giving Violet a curt look that Violet returned with venom. She knew Darla was right. It didn\u0027t make her any less pissed.\n \"I\u0027ll put a man on the door,\" Sergeant Rowe said mildly, though Violet noticed the fingers of her gun hand were quivering slightly, held close to her leg. \"I assume Mac\u0027s in no further danger, but the hell with it. I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027d just feel better knowing the protection\u0027s there.\"\n Violet looked at that shaking hand, lifted her eyes to Darla\u0027s face. \"Have you ever - \"\n \"Not in over twenty years on the force. This is my first.\" Darla gave a shaky laugh.\n \"My nerves are shot to shit. But I\u0027m glad as hell, if I had to finally do it, that it was to protect one of my own. I\u0027m going to go for that coffee and then deal with this mess.\n Want to come?\"\n \"I\u0027d suggest decaf,\" Violet said, casting a pointed look at her fingers. \"But I\u0027ll stick here. Maybe you could bring me back a cup, though. When you\u0027re done.\" She hesitated, brought a couple of dollars out of her back jeans pocket, reached over and put them in Darla\u0027s hand, met her gaze. \"My treat.\"\n Darla closed her fingers over Violet\u0027s, held there a moment. Nodded and turned toward the elevators.\n \"Oh.\" She stopped halfway there, turned back. \"You know, that was an amazing and selfless thing you did in there. You better have a good pair of running shoes.\"\n \"How\u0027s that?\"\n The sergeant cocked a brow. \"Knowing Mac, when he gets out of that bed and finds out what you did to protect him, he\u0027s going to chase you down and have your hide.\"\n \"He won\u0027t have far to go,\" Violet said, managing a tired smile. \"I\u0027ll be right here.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/natural-law-nature-of-desire-2/page-21.html","bookId":1907,"book":{"id":1907,"title":"Natural Law (Nature of Desire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Natural Law (Nature of Desire #2) \n Mackenzie \"Mac\" Nighthorse is a highly respected homicide detective and a career cop.
