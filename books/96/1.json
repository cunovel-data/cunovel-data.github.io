[bbe] Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 1:3 [hgb] 愿 颂 赞 归 与 我 们 的 主 耶 稣 基 督 的 父 神 ， 就 是 发 慈 悲 的 父 ， 赐 各 样 安 慰 的 神 。 [kjv] Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; [bbe] Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort; 1:4 [hgb] 我 们 在 一 切 患 难 中 ， 他 就 安 慰 我 们 ， 叫 我 们 能 用 神 所 赐 的 安 慰 ， 去 安 慰 那 遭 各 样 患 难 的 人 。 [kjv] Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. [bbe] Who gives us comfort in all our troubles, so that we may be able to give comfort to others who are in trouble, through the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 1:5 [hgb] 我 们 既 多 受 基 督 的 苦 楚 ， 就 靠 基 督 多 得 安 慰 。 [kjv] For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. [bbe] For as we undergo more of the pain which Christ underwent, so through Christ does our comfort become greater. 1:6 [hgb] 我 们 受 患 难 呢 ， 是 为 叫 你 们 得 安 慰 得 拯 救 。 我 们 得 安 慰 呢 ， 也 是 为 叫 你 们 得 安 慰 。 这 安 慰 能 叫 你 们 忍 受 我 们 所 受 的 那 样 苦 楚 。 [kjv] And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. [bbe] But if we are troubled, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which takes effect through your quiet undergoing of the same troubles which we undergo: 1:7 [hgb] 我 们 为 你 们 所 存 的 盼 望 是 确 定 的 。 因 为 知 道 你 们 既 是 同 受 苦 楚 ， 也 必 同 得 安 慰 。 [kjv] And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation. [bbe] And our hope for you is certain; in the knowledge that as you take part in the troubles, so you will take part in the comfort. 1:8 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 们 不 要 你 们 不 晓 得 ， 我 们 从 前 在 亚 西 亚 遭 遇 苦 难 ， 被 压 太 重 ， 力 不 能 胜 ， 甚 至 连 活 命 的 指 望 都 绝 了 。 [kjv] For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: [bbe] For it is our desire that you may not be without knowledge of our trouble which came on us in Asia, that the weight of it was very great, more than our power, so that it seemed that we had no hope even of life: 1:9 [hgb] 自 己 心 里 也 断 定 是 必 死 的 ， 叫 我 们 不 靠 自 己 ， 只 靠 叫 死 人 复 活 的 神 。 [kjv] But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: [bbe] Yes, we ourselves have had the answer of death in ourselves, so that our hope might not be in ourselves, but in God who is able to give life to the dead: 1:10 [hgb] 他 曾 救 我 们 脱 离 那 极 大 的 死 亡 ， 现 在 仍 要 救 我 们 ， 并 且 我 们 指 望 他 将 来 还 要 救 我 们 。 [kjv] Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us; [bbe] Who gave us salvation from so great a death: on whom we have put our hope that he will still go on to give us salvation; 1:11 [hgb] 你 们 以 祈 祷 帮 助 我 们 ， 好 叫 许 多 人 为 我 们 谢 恩 ， 就 是 为 我 们 因 许 多 人 所 得 的 恩 。 [kjv] Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf. [bbe] You at the same time helping together by your prayer for us; so that for what has been given to us through a number of persons, praise may go up to God for us from all of them. 1:12 [hgb] 我 们 所 夸 的 ， 是 自 己 的 良 心 ， 见 证 我 们 凭 着 神 的 圣 洁 和 诚 实 ， 在 世 为 人 ， 不 靠 人 的 聪 明 ， 乃 靠 神 的 恩 惠 ， 向 你 们 更 是 这 样 。 [kjv] For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. [bbe] For our glory is in this, in the knowledge which we have that our way of life in the world, and most of all in relation to you, has been holy and true in the eyes of God; not in the wisdom of the flesh, but in the grace of God. 1:13 [hgb] 我 们 现 在 写 给 你 们 的 话 ， 并 不 外 乎 你 们 所 念 的 ， 所 认 识 的 ， 我 也 盼 望 你 们 到 底 还 是 要 认 识 。 [kjv] For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; [bbe] For in our letters we say no other things to you, but those which you are reading, and to which you give agreement, and, it is my hope, will go on doing so to the end: 1:14 [hgb] 正 如 你 们 已 经 有 几 分 认 识 我 们 。 以 我 们 夸 口 ， 好 像 我 们 在 我 们 主 耶 稣 的 日 子 ， 以 你 们 夸 口 一 样 。 [kjv] As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus. [bbe] Even as you have been ready, in part, to say that we are your glory, in the same way that you are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus. 1:15 [hgb] 我 既 然 这 样 深 信 ， 就 早 有 意 到 你 们 那 里 去 ， 叫 你 们 再 得 益 处 。 [kjv] And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit; [bbe] And being certain of this, it was my purpose to come to you before, so that you might have a second grace; 1:16 [hgb] 也 要 从 你 们 那 里 经 过 ， 往 马 其 顿 去 ， 再 从 马 其 顿 回 到 你 们 那 里 ， 叫 你 们 给 我 送 行 往 犹 太 去 。 [kjv] And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea. [bbe] And by way of Corinth to go into Macedonia, and from there to come back again to you, so that you might send me on my way to Judaea. 1:17 [hgb] 我 有 此 意 ， 岂 是 反 复 不 定 吗 ？ 我 所 起 的 意 ， 岂 是 从 情 欲 起 的 ， 叫 我 忽 是 忽 非 吗 ？ [kjv] When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? [bbe] If then I had such a purpose, did I seem to be changing suddenly? or am I guided in my purposes by the flesh, saying, Yes, today, and, No, tomorrow? 1:18 [hgb] 我 指 着 信 实 的 神 说 ， 我 们 向 你 们 所 传 的 道 ， 并 没 有 是 而 又 非 的 。 [kjv] But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay. [bbe] As God is true, our word to you is not Yes and No. 1:19 [hgb] 因 为 我 和 西 拉 ， 并 提 摩 太 ， 在 你 们 中 间 所 传 神 的 儿 子 耶 稣 基 督 ， 总 没 有 是 而 又 非 的 ， 在 他 只 有 一 是 。 [kjv] For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. [bbe] For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we were preaching among you, even I and Silvanus and Timothy, was not Yes and No, but in him is Yes. 1:20 [hgb] 神 的 应 许 ， 不 论 有 多 少 ， 在 基 督 都 是 是 的 ， 所 以 借 着 他 也 都 是 实 在 的 ， （ 实 在 原 文 作 阿 们 ） 叫 神 因 我 们 得 荣 耀 。 [kjv] For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. [bbe] For he is the Yes to all the undertakings of God: and by him all the words of God are made certain and put into effect, to the glory of God through us. 1:21 [hgb] 那 在 基 督 里 坚 固 我 们 和 你 们 ， 并 且 膏 我 们 的 ， 就 是 神 。 [kjv] Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; [bbe] Now he who makes our faith strong together with you, in Christ, and has given us of his grace, is God; 1:22 [hgb] 他 又 用 印 印 了 我 们 ， 并 赐 圣 灵 在 我 们 心 里 作 凭 据 。 （ 原 文 作 质 ） 。 [kjv] Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. [bbe] And it is he who has put his stamp on us, even the Spirit, as the sign in our hearts of the coming glory. 1:23 [hgb] 我 呼 吁 神 给 我 的 心 作 见 证 ， 我 没 有 往 哥 林 多 去 ， 是 为 要 宽 容 你 们 。 [kjv] Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth. [bbe] But God is my witness that it was in pity for you that I did not come to Corinth at that time. 1:24 [hgb] 我 们 并 不 是 辖 管 你 们 的 信 心 ， 乃 是 帮 助 你 们 的 快 乐 。 因 为 你 们 凭 信 才 站 立 得 住 。 [kjv] Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand. [bbe] Not that we have authority over your faith, but we are helpers of your joy: for it is faith which is your support.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165/2255.html","bookId":96,"book":{"id":96,"title":"哥林多后书 2 Corinthians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 奉 神 旨 意 ， 作 基 督 耶 稣 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， 和 兄 弟 提 摩 太 ， 写 信 给 在 哥 林 多 神 的 教 会 ， 并 亚 该 亚 遍 处 的 众 圣 徒 。 [kjv] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
