{"id":2438,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 把 神 赐 给 马 其 顿 众 教 会 的 恩 告 诉 你 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; \\n\\n [bbe] And now we give you news, brothers, about the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia; \\n\\n 8:2 [hgb] 就 是 他 们 在 患 难 中 受 大 试 炼 的 时 候 ， 仍 有 满 足 的 快 乐 ， 在 极 穷 之 间 ， 还 格 外 显 出 他 们 乐 捐 的 厚 恩 。 \\n\\n [kjv] How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. \\n\\n [bbe] How while they were undergoing every sort of trouble, and were in the greatest need, they took all the greater joy in being able to give freely to the needs of others. \\n\\n 8:3 [hgb] 我 可 以 证 明 他 们 是 按 着 力 量 ， 而 且 也 过 了 力 量 ， 自 己 甘 心 乐 意 的 捐 助 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; \\n\\n [bbe] For I give them witness, that as they were able, and even more than they were able, they gave from the impulse of their hearts, \\n\\n 8:4 [hgb] 再 三 地 求 我 们 ， 准 他 们 在 这 供 给 圣 徒 的 恩 情 上 有 分 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. \\n\\n [bbe] Seriously requesting us that they might have a part in this grace of being servants to the needs of the saints: \\n\\n 8:5 [hgb] 并 且 他 们 所 作 的 ， 不 但 照 我 们 所 想 望 的 ， 更 照 神 的 旨 意 ， 先 把 自 己 献 给 主 ， 又 归 附 了 我 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. \\n\\n [bbe] And going even farther than our hope, they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us after the purpose of God. \\n\\n 8:6 [hgb] 因 此 我 劝 提 多 ， 既 然 在 你 们 中 间 开 办 这 慈 惠 的 事 ， 就 当 办 成 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also. \\n\\n [bbe] So that we made a request to Titus that, as he had made a start before, so he might make this grace complete in you. \\n\\n 8:7 [hgb] 你 们 既 然 在 信 心 ， 口 才 ， 知 识 ， 热 心 ， 和 待 我 们 的 爱 心 上 ， 都 格 外 显 出 满 足 来 ， 就 当 在 这 慈 惠 的 事 上 ， 也 格 外 显 出 满 足 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also. \\n\\n [bbe] And that as you are full of every good thing, of faith, of the word, of knowledge, of a ready mind, and of love to us, so you may be full of this grace in the same way. \\n\\n 8:8 [hgb] 我 说 这 话 ， 不 是 吩 咐 你 们 ， 乃 是 借 着 别 人 的 热 心 ， 试 验 你 们 爱 心 的 实 在 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love. \\n\\n [bbe] I am not giving you an order, but using the ready mind of others as a test of the quality of your love. \\n\\n 8:9 [hgb] 你 们 知 道 我 们 主 耶 稣 基 督 的 恩 典 。 他 本 来 富 足 ， 却 为 你 们 成 了 贫 穷 ， 叫 你 们 因 他 的 贫 穷 ， 可 以 成 为 富 足 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. \\n\\n [bbe] For you see the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, how though he had wealth, he became poor on your account, so that through his need you might have wealth. \\n\\n 8:10 [hgb] 我 在 这 事 上 把 我 的 意 见 告 诉 你 们 ， 是 与 你 们 有 益 。 因 为 你 们 下 手 办 这 事 ， 而 且 起 此 心 意 ， 已 经 有 一 年 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. \\n\\n [bbe] And in this I give my opinion: for it is to your profit, who were the first to make a start a year before, not only to do this, but to make clear that your minds were more than ready to do it. \\n\\n 8:11 [hgb] 如 今 就 当 办 成 这 事 。 既 有 愿 作 的 心 ， 也 当 照 你 们 所 有 的 去 办 成 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have. \\n\\n [bbe] Then make the doing of it complete; so that as you had a ready mind, you may give effect to it as you are able. \\n\\n 8:12 [hgb] 因 为 人 若 有 愿 作 的 心 ， 必 蒙 悦 纳 ， 乃 是 照 他 所 有 的 ， 并 不 是 照 他 所 无 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. \\n\\n [bbe] For if there is a ready mind, a man will have God\u0027s approval in the measure of what he has, and not of what he has not. \\n\\n 8:13 [hgb] 我 原 不 是 要 别 人 轻 省 ， 你 们 受 累 ， \\n\\n [kjv] For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: \\n\\n [bbe] And I am not saying this so that others may get off free, while the weight comes on you: \\n\\n 8:14 [hgb] 乃 要 均 平 。 就 是 要 你 们 的 富 余 ， 现 在 可 以 补 他 们 的 不 足 ， 使 他 们 的 富 余 ， 将 来 也 可 以 补 你 们 的 不 足 ， 这 就 均 平 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality: \\n\\n [bbe] But so that things may be equal; that from those things of which you have more than enough at the present time their need may be helped, and that if you are in any need they may be a help to you in the same way, making things equal. \\n\\n 8:15 [hgb] 如 经 上 所 记 ， 多 收 的 也 没 有 余 ， 少 收 的 也 没 有 缺 。 \\n\\n [kjv] As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack. \\n\\n [bbe] As it says in the Writings, He who had taken up much had nothing over and he who had little had enough. \\n\\n 8:16 [hgb] 多 谢 神 ， 感 动 提 多 的 心 ， 叫 他 待 你 们 殷 勤 ， 像 我 一 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. \\n\\n [bbe] But praise be to God, who puts the same care for you into the heart of Titus. \\n\\n 8:17 [hgb] 他 固 然 是 听 了 我 的 劝 。 但 自 己 更 是 热 心 ， 情 愿 往 你 们 那 里 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. \\n\\n [bbe] For while he gladly gave ear to our request, he was interested enough to go to you from the impulse of his heart. \\n\\n 8:18 [hgb] 我 们 还 打 发 一 位 兄 弟 和 他 同 去 。 这 人 在 福 音 上 得 了 众 教 会 的 称 赞 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; \\n\\n [bbe] And with him we have sent a brother whose praise in the good news has gone through all the churches; \\n\\n 8:19 [hgb] 不 但 这 样 ， 他 也 被 众 教 会 挑 选 ， 和 我 们 同 行 ， 把 所 托 与 我 们 的 这 捐 赀 送 到 了 ， 可 以 荣 耀 主 ， 又 表 明 我 们 乐 意 的 心 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind: \\n\\n [bbe] And not only so, but he was marked out by the churches to go with us in the grace of this giving which we have undertaken to the glory of the Lord and to make clear that our mind was ready: \\n\\n 8:20 [hgb] 这 就 免 得 有 人 因 我 们 收 的 捐 银 很 多 ， 就 挑 我 们 的 不 是 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: \\n\\n [bbe] And so that no man might be able to say anything against us in the business of this giving which has been put into our hands: \\n\\n 8:21 [hgb] 我 们 留 心 行 光 明 的 事 ， 不 但 在 主 面 前 ， 就 在 人 面 前 ， 也 是 这 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. \\n\\n [bbe] For the business has been so ordered by us as to have the approval, not only of the Lord, but of men. \\n\\n 8:22 [hgb] 我 们 又 打 发 一 位 兄 弟 同 去 。 这 人 的 热 心 ， 我 们 在 许 多 事 上 ， 屡 次 试 验 过 ， 现 在 他 因 为 深 信 你 们 ， 就 更 加 热 心 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. \\n\\n [bbe] And we have sent with them our brother, whose ready spirit has been made clear to us at times and in ways without number, but it is now all the more so because of the certain faith which he has in you. \\n\\n 8:23 [hgb] 论 到 提 多 ， 他 是 我 的 同 伴 ， 一 同 为 你 们 劳 碌 的 。 论 到 那 两 位 兄 弟 ， 他 们 是 众 教 会 的 使 者 ， 是 基 督 的 荣 耀 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ. \\n\\n [bbe] If any question comes up about Titus, he is my brother-worker, working with me for you; or about the others, they are the representatives of the churches to the glory of Christ. \\n\\n 8:24 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 务 要 在 众 教 会 面 前 ， 显 明 你 们 爱 心 的 凭 据 ， 并 我 所 夸 奖 你 们 的 凭 据 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf. \\n\\n [bbe] Make clear then to them, as representatives of the churches, the quality of your love, and that the things which we have said about you are true. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165/2262.html","bookId":96,"book":{"id":96,"title":"哥林多后书 2 Corinthians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 奉 神 旨 意 ， 作 基 督 耶 稣 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， 和 兄 弟 提 摩 太 ， 写 信 给 在 哥 林 多 神 的 教 会 ， 并 亚 该 亚 遍 处 的 众 圣 徒 。 [kjv] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
