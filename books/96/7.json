{"id":2437,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"7:1 [hgb] 亲 爱 的 弟 兄 阿 ， 我 们 既 有 这 等 应 许 ， 就 当 洁 净 自 己 ， 除 去 身 体 灵 魂 一 切 的 污 秽 ， 敬 畏 神 ， 得 以 成 圣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. \\n\\n [bbe] Because God, then, will give us such rewards, dear brothers, let us make ourselves clean from all evil of flesh and spirit, and become completely holy in the fear of God. \\n\\n 7:2 [hgb] 你 们 要 心 地 宽 大 收 纳 我 们 。 我 们 未 曾 亏 负 谁 ， 未 曾 败 坏 谁 ， 未 曾 占 谁 的 便 宜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man. \\n\\n [bbe] Let your hearts be open to us: we have done no man wrong, no man has been damaged by us, we have made no profit out of any man, \\n\\n 7:3 [hgb] 我 说 这 话 ， 不 是 要 定 你 们 的 罪 。 我 已 经 说 过 ， 你 们 常 在 我 们 心 里 ， 情 愿 与 你 们 同 生 同 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you. \\n\\n [bbe] It is not with the purpose of judging you that I say this: for I have said before that you are in our hearts for life and death together. \\n\\n 7:4 [hgb] 我 大 大 地 放 胆 向 你 们 说 话 。 我 因 你 们 多 多 夸 口 ， 满 得 安 慰 。 我 们 在 一 切 患 难 中 分 外 的 快 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. \\n\\n [bbe] My words to you are without fear, I am full of pride on account of you: I have great comfort and joy in all our troubles. \\n\\n 7:5 [hgb] 我 们 从 前 就 是 到 了 马 其 顿 的 时 候 ， 身 体 也 不 得 安 宁 ， 周 围 遭 患 难 ， 外 有 争 战 ， 内 有 惧 怕 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears. \\n\\n [bbe] For even when we had come into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; there were fightings outside and fears inside. \\n\\n 7:6 [hgb] 但 那 安 慰 丧 气 之 人 的 神 ， 借 着 提 多 来 安 慰 了 我 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus; \\n\\n [bbe] But God who gives comfort to the poor in spirit gave us comfort by the coming of Titus; \\n\\n 7:7 [hgb] 不 但 借 着 他 来 ， 也 借 着 他 从 你 们 所 得 的 安 慰 ， 安 慰 了 我 们 。 因 他 把 你 们 的 想 念 ， 哀 恸 ， 和 向 我 的 热 心 ， 都 告 诉 了 我 ， 叫 我 更 加 欢 喜 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. \\n\\n [bbe] And not by his coming only, but by the comfort which he had in you, while he gave us word of your desire, your sorrow, your care for me; so that I was still more glad. \\n\\n 7:8 [hgb] 我 先 前 写 信 叫 你 们 忧 愁 。 我 后 来 虽 然 懊 悔 ， 如 今 却 不 懊 悔 。 因 我 知 道 那 信 叫 你 们 忧 愁 ， 不 过 是 暂 时 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though it were but for a season. \\n\\n [bbe] For though my letter gave you pain, I have no regret for it now, though I had before; for I see that the letter gave you pain, but only for a time. \\n\\n 7:9 [hgb] 如 今 我 欢 喜 ， 不 是 因 你 们 忧 愁 ， 是 因 你 们 从 忧 愁 中 生 出 懊 悔 来 。 你 们 依 着 神 的 意 思 忧 愁 ， 凡 事 就 不 至 于 因 我 们 受 亏 损 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing. \\n\\n [bbe] Now I am glad, not that you had sorrow, but that your sorrow was the cause of a change of heart; for yours was a holy sorrow so that you might undergo no loss by us in anything. \\n\\n 7:10 [hgb] 因 为 依 着 神 的 意 思 忧 愁 ， 就 生 出 没 有 后 悔 的 懊 悔 来 ， 以 致 得 救 。 但 世 俗 的 忧 愁 ， 是 叫 人 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. \\n\\n [bbe] For the sorrow which God gives is the cause of salvation through a change of heart, in which there is no reason for grief: but the sorrow of the world is a cause of death. \\n\\n 7:11 [hgb] 你 看 ， 你 们 依 着 神 的 意 思 忧 愁 ， 从 此 就 生 出 何 等 的 殷 勤 ， 自 诉 ， 自 恨 ， 恐 惧 ， 想 念 ， 热 心 ， 责 罚 （ 或 作 自 责 ） ， 在 这 一 切 事 上 你 们 都 表 明 自 己 是 洁 净 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. \\n\\n [bbe] For you see what care was produced in you by this very sorrow of yours before God, what clearing of yourselves, what wrath against sin, what fear, what desire, what serious purpose, what punishment. In everything you have made it clear that you are free from sin in this business. \\n\\n 7:12 [hgb] 我 虽 然 从 前 写 信 给 你 们 却 不 是 为 那 亏 负 人 的 ， 也 不 是 为 那 受 人 亏 负 的 ， 乃 要 在 神 面 前 ， 把 你 们 顾 念 我 们 的 热 心 ， 表 明 出 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you. \\n\\n [bbe] So though I sent you a letter, it was not only because of the man who did the wrong, or because of him to whom the wrong was done, but so that your true care for us might be made clear in the eyes of God. \\n\\n 7:13 [hgb] 故 此 我 们 得 了 安 慰 ， 并 且 在 安 慰 之 中 ， 因 你 们 众 人 使 提 多 心 里 畅 快 欢 喜 ， 我 们 就 更 加 欢 喜 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. \\n\\n [bbe] So we have been comforted: and we had the greater joy in our comfort because of the joy of Titus, for his spirit had been made glad by you all. \\n\\n 7:14 [hgb] 我 若 对 提 多 夸 奖 了 你 们 什 么 ， 也 觉 得 没 有 惭 愧 。 因 我 对 提 多 夸 奖 你 们 的 话 ， 成 了 真 的 。 正 如 我 对 你 们 所 说 的 话 ， 也 都 是 真 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth. \\n\\n [bbe] For I was not put to shame in anything in which I may have made clear to him my pride in you; but as we said nothing to you but what was true, so the good things which I said to Titus about you were seen by him to be true. \\n\\n 7:15 [hgb] 并 且 提 多 想 起 你 们 众 人 的 顺 服 ， 是 怎 样 恐 惧 战 兢 地 接 待 他 ， 他 爱 你 们 的 心 肠 就 越 发 热 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. \\n\\n [bbe] And his love to you is the more increased by his memory of you all, how you gave way to his authority, and how you took him to your hearts with fear and honour. \\n\\n 7:16 [hgb] 我 如 今 欢 喜 ， 能 在 凡 事 上 为 你 们 放 心 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things. \\n\\n [bbe] It gives me great joy to see you answering to my good opinion of you in every way. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165/2261.html","bookId":96,"book":{"id":96,"title":"哥林多后书 2 Corinthians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 奉 神 旨 意 ， 作 基 督 耶 稣 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， 和 兄 弟 提 摩 太 ， 写 信 给 在 哥 林 多 神 的 教 会 ， 并 亚 该 亚 遍 处 的 众 圣 徒 。 [kjv] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
