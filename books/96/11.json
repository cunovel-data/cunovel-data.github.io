{"id":2441,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"11:1 [hgb] 但 愿 你 们 宽 容 我 这 一 点 愚 妄 。 其 实 你 们 原 是 宽 容 我 的 。 \n [kjv] Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me. \n [bbe] Put up with me if I am a little foolish: but, truly, you do put up with me. \n 11:2 [hgb] 我 为 你 们 起 的 愤 恨 ， 原 是 神 那 样 的 愤 恨 。 因 为 我 曾 把 你 们 许 配 一 个 丈 夫 ， 要 把 你 们 如 同 贞 洁 的 童 女 ， 献 给 基 督 。 \n [kjv] For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. \n [bbe] For I have a very great care for you: because you have been married by me to one husband, and it is my desire to give you completely holy to Christ. \n 11:3 [hgb] 我 只 怕 你 们 的 心 或 偏 于 邪 ， 失 去 那 向 基 督 所 存 纯 一 清 洁 的 心 ， 就 像 蛇 用 诡 诈 诱 惑 了 夏 娃 一 样 。 \n [kjv] But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. \n [bbe] But I have a fear, that in some way, as Eve was tricked by the deceit of the snake, your minds may be turned away from their simple and holy love for Christ. \n 11:4 [hgb] 假 如 有 人 来 ， 另 传 一 个 耶 稣 ， 不 是 我 们 所 传 过 的 。 或 者 你 们 另 受 一 个 灵 ， 不 是 你 们 所 受 过 的 。 或 者 另 得 一 个 福 音 ， 不 是 你 们 所 得 过 的 。 你 们 容 让 他 也 就 罢 了 。 \n [kjv] For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him. \n [bbe] For if anyone comes preaching another Jesus from the one whose preachers we are, or if you have got a different spirit, or a different sort of good news from those which came to you, how well you put up with these things. \n 11:5 [hgb] 但 我 想 ， 我 一 点 不 在 那 些 最 大 的 使 徒 以 下 。 \n [kjv] For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. \n [bbe] For in my opinion, I am in no way less than the most important of the Apostles. \n 11:6 [hgb] 我 的 言 语 虽 然 粗 俗 ， 我 的 知 识 却 不 粗 俗 。 这 是 我 们 在 凡 事 上 ， 向 你 们 众 人 显 明 出 来 的 。 \n [kjv] But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. \n [bbe] But though I am rough in my way of talking, I am not so in knowledge, as we have made clear to all by our acts among you. \n 11:7 [hgb] 我 因 为 白 白 传 神 的 福 音 给 你 们 ， 就 自 居 卑 微 ， 叫 你 们 高 升 ， 这 算 是 我 犯 罪 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? \n [bbe] Or did I do wrong in making myself low so that you might be lifted up, because I gave you the good news of God without reward? \n 11:8 [hgb] 我 亏 负 了 别 的 教 会 ， 向 他 们 取 了 工 价 来 ， 给 你 们 效 力 。 \n [kjv] I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service. \n [bbe] I took money from other churches as payment for my work, so that I might be your servant; \n 11:9 [hgb] 我 在 你 们 那 里 缺 乏 的 时 候 ， 并 没 有 累 着 你 们 一 个 人 。 因 我 所 缺 乏 的 ， 那 从 马 其 顿 来 的 弟 兄 们 都 补 足 了 。 我 向 来 凡 事 谨 守 ， 后 来 也 必 谨 守 ， 总 不 至 于 累 着 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself. \n [bbe] And when I was present with you, and was in need, I let no man be responsible for me; for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, gave me whatever was needed; and in everything I kept myself from being a trouble to you, and I will go on doing so. \n 11:10 [hgb] 既 有 基 督 的 诚 实 在 我 里 面 ， 就 无 人 能 在 亚 该 亚 一 带 地 方 阻 挡 我 这 自 夸 。 \n [kjv] As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. \n [bbe] As the true word of Christ is in me, I will let no man take from me this my cause of pride in the country of Achaia. \n 11:11 [hgb] 为 什 么 呢 ？ 是 因 我 不 爱 你 们 吗 ？ 这 有 神 知 道 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. \n [bbe] Why? because I have no love for you? let God be judge. \n 11:12 [hgb] 我 现 在 所 作 的 ， 后 来 还 要 作 ， 为 要 断 绝 那 些 寻 机 会 人 的 机 会 ， 使 他 们 在 所 夸 的 事 上 ， 也 不 过 与 我 们 一 样 。 \n [kjv] But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. \n [bbe] But what I do, that I will go on doing, so that I may give no chance to those who are looking for one; so that, in the cause of their pride, they may be seen to be the same as we are. \n 11:13 [hgb] 那 等 人 是 假 使 徒 ， 行 事 诡 诈 ， 装 作 基 督 使 徒 的 模 样 。 \n [kjv] For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. \n [bbe] For such men are false Apostles, workers of deceit, making themselves seem like Apostles of Christ. \n 11:14 [hgb] 这 也 不 足 为 怪 。 因 为 连 撒 但 也 装 作 光 明 的 天 使 。 \n [kjv] And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. \n [bbe] And it is no wonder; for even Satan himself is able to take the form of an angel of light. \n 11:15 [hgb] 所 以 他 的 差 役 ， 若 装 作 仁 义 的 差 役 ， 也 不 算 希 奇 。 他 们 的 结 局 ， 必 然 照 着 他 们 的 行 为 。 \n [kjv] Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. \n [bbe] So it is no great thing if his servants make themselves seem to be servants of righteousness; whose end will be the reward of their works. \n 11:16 [hgb] 我 再 说 ， 人 不 可 把 我 看 作 愚 妄 的 。 纵 然 如 此 ， 也 要 把 我 当 作 愚 妄 人 接 纳 ， 叫 我 可 以 略 略 自 夸 。 \n [kjv] I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. \n [bbe] I say again, Let me not seem foolish to anyone; but if I do, put up with me as such, so that I may take a little glory to myself. \n 11:17 [hgb] 我 说 的 话 ， 不 是 奉 主 命 说 的 ， 乃 是 像 愚 妄 人 放 胆 自 夸 。 \n [kjv] That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. \n [bbe] What I am now saying is not by the order of the Lord, but as a foolish person, taking credit to myself, as it seems. \n 11:18 [hgb] 既 有 好 些 人 凭 着 血 气 自 夸 ， 我 也 要 自 夸 了 。 \n [kjv] Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. \n [bbe] Seeing that there are those who take credit to themselves after the flesh, I will do the same. \n 11:19 [hgb] 你 们 既 是 精 明 人 ， 就 能 甘 心 忍 耐 愚 妄 人 。 \n [kjv] For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. \n [bbe] For you put up with the foolish gladly, being wise yourselves. \n 11:20 [hgb] 假 若 有 人 强 你 们 作 奴 仆 ， 或 侵 吞 你 们 ， 或 掳 掠 你 们 ， 或 悔 慢 你 们 ， 或 打 你 们 的 脸 ， 你 们 都 能 忍 耐 他 。 \n [kjv] For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. \n [bbe] You put up with a man if he makes servants of you, if he makes profit out of you, if he makes you prisoners, if he puts himself in a high place, if he gives you blows on the face. \n 11:21 [hgb] 我 说 这 话 ， 是 羞 辱 自 己 。 好 像 我 们 从 前 是 软 弱 的 。 然 而 人 在 何 事 上 勇 敢 ， （ 我 说 句 愚 妄 话 ） 我 也 勇 敢 。 \n [kjv] I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. \n [bbe] I say this by way of shaming ourselves, as if we had been feeble. But if anyone puts himself forward (I am talking like a foolish person), I will do the same. \n 11:22 [hgb] 他 们 是 希 伯 来 人 吗 ？ 我 也 是 。 他 们 是 以 色 列 人 吗 ？ 我 也 是 。 他 们 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 吗 ？ 我 也 是 。 \n [kjv] Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. \n [bbe] Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they of Israel? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. \n 11:23 [hgb] 他 们 是 基 督 的 仆 人 吗 ？ （ 我 说 句 狂 话 ） 我 更 是 。 我 比 他 们 多 受 劳 苦 ， 多 下 监 牢 ， 受 鞭 打 是 过 重 的 ， 冒 死 是 屡 次 有 的 。 \n [kjv] Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. \n [bbe] Are they servants of Christ? (I am talking foolishly) I am more so; I have had more experience of hard work, of prisons, of blows more than measure, of death. \n 11:24 [hgb] 被 犹 太 人 鞭 打 五 次 ， 每 次 四 十 ， 减 去 一 下 。 \n [kjv] Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. \n [bbe] Five times the Jews gave me forty blows but one. \n 11:25 [hgb] 被 棍 打 了 三 次 ， 被 石 头 打 了 一 次 ， 遇 着 船 坏 三 次 ， 一 昼 一 夜 在 深 海 里 。 \n [kjv] Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; \n [bbe] Three times I was whipped with rods, once I was stoned, three times the ship I was in came to destruction at sea, a night and a day I have been in the water; \n 11:26 [hgb] 又 屡 次 行 远 路 ， 遭 江 河 的 危 险 ， 盗 贼 的 危 险 ， 同 族 的 危 险 ， 外 邦 人 的 危 险 ， 城 里 的 危 险 ， 旷 野 的 危 险 ， 海 中 的 危 险 ， 假 弟 兄 的 危 险 。 \n [kjv] In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; \n [bbe] In frequent travels, in dangers on rivers, in dangers from outlaws, in dangers from my countrymen, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the town, in dangers in the waste land, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brothers; \n 11:27 [hgb] 受 劳 碌 ， 受 困 苦 ， 多 次 不 得 睡 ， 又 饥 又 渴 ， 多 次 不 得 食 。 受 寒 冷 ， 赤 身 露 体 。 \n [kjv] In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. \n [bbe] In hard work and weariness, in frequent watchings, going without food and drink, cold and in need of clothing. \n 11:28 [hgb] 除 了 这 外 面 的 事 ， 还 有 为 众 教 会 挂 心 的 事 ， 天 天 压 在 我 身 上 。 \n [kjv] Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. \n [bbe] In addition to all the other things, there is that which comes on me every day, the care of all the churches. \n 11:29 [hgb] 有 谁 软 弱 ， 我 不 软 弱 呢 ？ 有 谁 跌 倒 ， 我 不 焦 急 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? \n [bbe] Who is feeble and I am not feeble? who is in danger of falling, and I am not angry? \n 11:30 [hgb] 我 若 必 须 自 夸 ， 就 夸 那 关 乎 我 软 弱 的 事 便 了 。 \n [kjv] If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. \n [bbe] If I have to take credit to myself, I will do so in the things in which I am feeble. \n 11:31 [hgb] 那 永 远 可 称 颂 之 主 耶 稣 的 父 神 ， 知 道 我 不 说 谎 。 \n [kjv] The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. \n [bbe] The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be praise for ever, is witness that the things which I say are true. \n 11:32 [hgb] 在 大 马 色 亚 哩 达 王 手 下 的 提 督 ， 把 守 大 马 色 城 要 捉 拿 我 。 \n [kjv] In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: \n [bbe] In Damascus, the ruler under Aretas the king kept watch over the town of the people of Damascus, in order to take me: \n 11:33 [hgb] 我 就 从 窗 户 中 ， 在 筐 子 里 从 城 墙 上 被 人 缒 下 去 ， 脱 离 了 他 的 手 。 \n [kjv] And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands. \n [bbe] And being let down in a basket from the wall through a window, I got free from his hands. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165/2265.html","bookId":96,"book":{"id":96,"title":"哥林多后书 2 Corinthians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 奉 神 旨 意 ， 作 基 督 耶 稣 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， 和 兄 弟 提 摩 太 ， 写 信 给 在 哥 林 多 神 的 教 会 ， 并 亚 该 亚 遍 处 的 众 圣 徒 。 [kjv] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
