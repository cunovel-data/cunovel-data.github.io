\n [bbe] For if I give you sorrow, who then will make me glad, but he who is made sad by me? \n 2:3 [hgb] 我 曾 把 这 事 写 给 你 们 ， 恐 怕 我 到 的 时 候 ， 应 该 叫 我 快 乐 的 那 些 人 ， 反 倒 叫 我 忧 愁 。 我 也 深 信 ， 你 们 众 人 都 以 我 的 快 乐 为 自 己 的 快 乐 。 \n [kjv] And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all. \n [bbe] And I said this very thing in my letter, for fear that when I came I might have sorrow from those from whom it was right for me to have joy; being certain of this, that my joy is the joy of you all. \n 2:4 [hgb] 我 先 前 心 里 难 过 痛 苦 ， 多 多 地 流 泪 ， 写 信 给 你 们 。 不 是 叫 你 们 忧 愁 ， 乃 是 叫 你 们 知 道 我 格 外 的 疼 爱 你 们 。 \n [kjv] For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you. \n [bbe] For out of much trouble and pain of heart and much weeping I sent my letter to you; not to give you sorrow, but so that you might see how great is the love which I have to you. \n 2:5 [hgb] 若 有 叫 人 忧 愁 的 ， 他 不 但 叫 我 忧 愁 ， 也 是 叫 你 们 众 人 有 几 分 忧 愁 ， 我 说 几 分 ， 恐 怕 说 得 太 重 。 \n [kjv] But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. \n [bbe] But if anyone has been a cause of sorrow, he has been so, not to me only, but in some measure to all of you (I say this that I may not be over-hard on you). \n 2:6 [hgb] 这 样 的 人 ， 受 了 众 人 的 责 罚 ， 也 就 够 了 。 \n [kjv] Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many. \n [bbe] Let it be enough for such a man to have undergone the punishment which the church put on him; \n 2:7 [hgb] 倒 不 如 赦 免 他 ， 安 慰 他 ， 免 得 他 忧 愁 太 过 ， 甚 至 沉 沦 了 。 \n [kjv] So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. \n [bbe] So that now, on the other hand, it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you, for fear that his sorrow may be over-great. \n 2:8 [hgb] 所 以 我 劝 你 们 ， 要 向 他 显 出 坚 定 不 移 的 爱 心 来 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him. \n [bbe] For which cause my desire is that you will make your love to him clear by your acts. \n 2:9 [hgb] 为 此 我 先 前 也 写 信 给 你 们 ， 要 试 验 你 们 ， 看 你 们 凡 事 顺 从 不 顺 从 。 \n [kjv] For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. \n [bbe] And for the same reason I sent you a letter so that I might be certain of your desire to do my orders in all things. \n 2:10 [hgb] 你 们 赦 免 谁 ， 我 也 赦 免 谁 ， 我 若 有 所 赦 免 的 ， 是 在 基 督 面 前 为 你 们 赦 免 的 。 \n [kjv] To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; \n [bbe] But if you give forgiveness to anyone, I do the same: for if I have given forgiveness for anything, I have done it because of you, in the person of Christ; \n 2:11 [hgb] 免 得 撒 但 趁 着 机 会 胜 过 我 们 。 因 我 们 并 非 不 晓 得 他 的 诡 计 。 \n [kjv] Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. \n [bbe] So that Satan may not get the better of us: for we are not without knowledge of his designs. \n 2:12 [hgb] 我 从 前 为 基 督 的 福 音 到 了 特 罗 亚 ， 主 也 给 我 开 了 门 。 \n [kjv] Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ\u0027s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, \n [bbe] Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ, and there was an open door for me in the Lord, \n 2:13 [hgb] 那 时 因 为 没 有 遇 见 兄 弟 提 多 ， 我 心 里 不 安 ， 便 辞 别 那 里 的 人 往 马 其 顿 去 了 。 \n [kjv] I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. \n [bbe] I had no rest in my spirit because Titus my brother was not there: so I went away from them, and came into Macedonia. \n 2:14 [hgb] 感 谢 神 ， 常 帅 领 我 们 在 基 督 里 夸 胜 ， 并 借 着 我 们 在 各 处 显 扬 那 因 认 识 基 督 而 有 的 香 气 。 \n [kjv] Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. \n [bbe] But praise be to God who makes us strong to overcome in Christ, and makes clear through us in every place the value of the knowledge of him. \n 2:15 [hgb] 因 为 我 们 在 神 面 前 ， 无 论 在 得 救 的 人 身 上 ， 或 灭 亡 的 人 身 上 ， 都 有 基 督 馨 香 之 气 。 \n [kjv] For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: \n [bbe] For we are a sweet perfume of Christ to God in those who are getting salvation and in those who are going to destruction; \n 2:16 [hgb] 在 这 等 人 ， 就 作 了 死 的 香 气 叫 他 死 。 在 那 等 人 ， 就 作 了 活 的 香 气 叫 他 活 。 这 事 谁 能 当 得 起 呢 ？ \n [kjv] To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things? \n [bbe] To the one it is a perfume of death to death; to the other a perfume of life to life. And who is enough for such things? \n 2:17 [hgb] 我 们 不 像 那 许 多 人 ， 为 利 混 乱 神 的 道 。 乃 是 由 于 诚 实 ， 由 于 神 ， 在 神 面 前 凭 着 基 督 讲 道 。 \n [kjv] For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ. \n [bbe] For we are not like the great number who make use of the word of God for profit: but our words are true, as from God, being said as before God in Christ. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165/2256.html","bookId":96,"book":{"id":96,"title":"哥林多后书 2 Corinthians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 奉 神 旨 意 ， 作 基 督 耶 稣 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， 和 兄 弟 提 摩 太 ， 写 信 给 在 哥 林 多 神 的 教 会 ， 并 亚 该 亚 遍 处 的 众 圣 徒 。 [kjv] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
