{"id":2440,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"10:1 [hgb] 我 保 罗 就 是 与 你 们 见 面 的 时 候 是 谦 卑 的 ， 不 在 你 们 那 里 的 时 候 向 你 们 是 勇 敢 的 ， 如 今 亲 自 借 着 基 督 的 温 柔 和 平 ， 劝 你 们 。 [kjv] Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: [bbe] Now I, Paul, myself make request to you by the quiet and gentle behaviour of Christ, I who am poor in spirit when with you, but who say what is in my mind to you without fear when I am away from you: 10:2 [hgb] 有 人 以 为 我 是 凭 着 血 气 行 事 ， 我 也 以 为 必 须 用 勇 敢 待 这 等 人 ， 求 你 们 不 要 叫 我 在 你 们 那 里 的 时 候 ， 有 这 样 的 勇 敢 。 [kjv] But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. [bbe] Yes, I make my request to you, so that when I am with you I may not have to make use of the authority which may be needed against some to whom we seem to be walking after the flesh. 10:3 [hgb] 因 为 我 们 虽 然 在 血 气 中 行 事 ， 却 不 凭 着 血 气 争 战 。 [kjv] For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: [bbe] For though we may be living in the flesh, we are not fighting after the way of the flesh 10:4 [hgb] 我 们 争 战 的 兵 器 ， 本 不 是 属 血 气 的 ， 乃 是 在 神 面 前 有 能 力 可 以 攻 破 坚 固 的 营 垒 ， [kjv] (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) [bbe] (For the arms with which we are fighting are not those of the flesh, but are strong before God for the destruction of high places); 10:5 [hgb] 将 各 样 的 计 谋 ， 各 样 拦 阻 人 认 识 神 的 那 些 自 高 之 事 ， 一 概 攻 破 了 ， 又 将 人 所 有 的 心 意 夺 回 ， 使 他 都 顺 服 基 督 。 [kjv] Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; [bbe] Putting an end to reasonings, and every high thing which is lifted up against the knowledge of God, and causing every thought to come under the authority of Christ; 10:6 [hgb] 并 且 我 已 经 预 备 好 了 ， 等 你 们 十 分 顺 服 的 时 候 ， 要 责 罚 那 一 切 不 顺 服 的 人 。 [kjv] And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled. [bbe] Being ready to give punishment to whatever is against his authority, after you have made it clear that you are completely under his control. 10:7 [hgb] 你 们 是 看 眼 前 的 吗 ？ 倘 若 有 人 自 信 是 属 基 督 的 ， 他 要 再 想 想 ， 他 如 何 属 基 督 ， 我 们 也 是 如 何 属 基 督 的 。 [kjv] Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ\u0027s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ\u0027s, even so are we Christ\u0027s. [bbe] Give attention to the things which are before you. If any man seems to himself to be Christ\u0027s, let him keep in mind that we are as much Christ\u0027s as he is. 10:8 [hgb] 主 赐 给 我 们 权 柄 是 要 造 就 你 们 ， 并 不 是 要 败 坏 你 们 。 我 就 是 为 这 权 柄 稍 微 夸 口 ， 也 不 至 于 惭 愧 。 [kjv] For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: [bbe] For though I might take pride in our authority (which the Lord gave for building you up, and not for your destruction), it will not be a cause of shame to me: 10:9 [hgb] 我 说 这 话 免 得 你 们 以 为 我 写 信 是 要 威 吓 你 们 。 [kjv] That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. [bbe] That I may not seem to have the desire of causing you fear by my letters. 10:10 [hgb] 因 为 有 人 说 ， 他 的 信 ， 又 沉 重 ， 又 利 害 。 及 至 见 面 ， 却 是 气 貌 不 扬 ， 言 语 粗 俗 的 。 [kjv] For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible. [bbe] For his letters, they say, have weight and are strong; but in body he is feeble, and his way of talking has little force. 10:11 [hgb] 这 等 人 当 想 ， 我 们 不 在 那 里 的 时 候 ， 信 上 的 言 语 如 何 ， 见 面 的 时 候 ， 行 事 也 必 如 何 。 [kjv] Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present. [bbe] Let those who say this keep in mind that, what we are in word by letters when we are away, so will we be in act when we are present. 10:12 [hgb] 因 为 我 们 不 敢 将 自 己 和 那 自 荐 的 人 同 列 相 比 。 他 们 用 自 己 度 量 自 己 ， 用 自 己 比 较 自 己 ， 乃 是 不 通 达 的 。 [kjv] For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. [bbe] For we will not make comparison of ourselves with some of those who say good things about themselves: but these, measuring themselves by themselves, and making comparison of themselves with themselves, are not wise. 10:13 [hgb] 我 们 不 愿 意 分 外 夸 口 ， 只 要 照 神 所 量 给 我 们 的 界 限 ， 构 到 你 们 那 里 。 [kjv] But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. [bbe] We will not give glory to ourselves in over-great measure, but after the measure of the rule which God has given us, a measure which comes even to you. 10:14 [hgb] 我 们 并 非 过 了 自 己 的 界 限 ， 好 像 构 不 到 你 们 那 里 。 因 为 我 们 早 到 你 们 那 里 ， 传 了 基 督 的 福 音 。 [kjv] For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ: [bbe] For we have no need to make ourselves seem more than we are, as if our authority did not come as far as to you: for we came even as far as you with the good news of Christ: 10:15 [hgb] 我 们 不 仗 着 别 人 所 劳 碌 的 ， 分 外 夸 口 。 但 指 望 你 们 信 心 增 长 的 时 候 ， 所 量 给 我 们 的 界 限 ， 就 可 以 因 着 你 们 更 加 开 展 ， [kjv] Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men\u0027s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, [bbe] Not taking credit to ourselves for what is not our business, that is, for the work of others; but having hope that, with the growth of your faith, we may get the credit for an increase which is the effect of our work, 10:16 [hgb] 得 以 将 福 音 传 到 你 们 以 外 的 地 方 ， 并 不 是 在 别 人 界 限 之 内 ， 借 着 他 现 成 的 事 夸 口 。 [kjv] To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man\u0027s line of things made ready to our hand. [bbe] So that we may be able to go on and take the good news to countries still farther away than you are, and not take credit for another man\u0027s work in making things ready to our hand. 10:17 [hgb] 但 夸 口 的 当 指 着 主 夸 口 。 [kjv] But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. [bbe] But whoever has a desire for glory, let his glory be in the Lord. 10:18 [hgb] 因 为 蒙 悦 纳 的 ， 不 是 自 己 称 许 的 ， 乃 是 主 所 称 许 的 。 [kjv] For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. [bbe] For the Lord\u0027s approval of a man is not dependent on his opinion of himself, but on the Lord\u0027s opinion of him.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165/2264.html","bookId":96,"book":{"id":96,"title":"哥林多后书 2 Corinthians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 奉 神 旨 意 ， 作 基 督 耶 稣 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， 和 兄 弟 提 摩 太 ， 写 信 给 在 哥 林 多 神 的 教 会 ， 并 亚 该 亚 遍 处 的 众 圣 徒 。 [kjv] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/165","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
