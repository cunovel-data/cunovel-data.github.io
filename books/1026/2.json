{"id":36695,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II","content":"Laura Childs came into the quiet, fire-lit room like a little whirl of fresh wind. The young man, looming up behind her in the doorway, clean-shaven, square-jawed, honest-eyed, gave a sunshiny grin of general friendliness and said he hoped Mrs. Payton would forgive him for butting in, but Fred had told him to call for some book she wanted him to read, and the maid didn\u0027t know anything about it. \n \n \"I thought perhaps she had left it with you,\" he said. \n \n Mrs. Payton, conscious, as were the other two, of having talked about the speaker only a minute before, expressed flurried and embarrassed concern. She was so sorry! She couldn\u0027t imagine where the book was! She got up, and fumbled among the Flowers of Peace. \"You don\u0027t remember the title?\" \n \n He shook his head. \"Awfully sorry. I\u0027m so stupid about all these deep books Fred\u0027s so keen on. Something about birth-rate and the higher education, I think.\" \n \n Mrs. Payton stiffened visibly. \"I don\u0027t know of any such book,\" she said; then murmured, perfunctorily, that he must have a cup of tea. \n \n Again Mr. Maitland was sorry,—\"dreadfully sorry,\"—but he had to go. He went; and the two ladies looked at each other. \n \n [Pg 20] \n \n \"Do you suppose he heard us?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe he did!\" \n \n \"Nice chap,\" said Mr. Weston. \n \n On the way down-stairs the nice chap was telling Laura that he had caught on, the minute he got into that room, that it wasn\u0027t any social whirl, so he thought he\u0027d better get out. \n \n \"They\u0027re sitting on Freddy, I\u0027m afraid,\" Laura said, soberly; \"poor old Fred!\" \n \n \"Well, I put one over when I asked for that book! I bet even old Weston\u0027s never read it! Neither have I. But Fred can give us all cards and spades on sociology.\" \n \n \"She\u0027s great,\" Laura agreed; \"but the book isn\u0027t so awfully deep. Well, I\u0027m going back to root for her!\" \n \n She ran up to the sitting-room again, and demanded tea. Her face, under her big black hat, was like a rose, and her pleasant brown eyes glanced with all the sweet, good-natured indifference of kindly youth at the three troubled people about the tea-table. Somehow, quite unreasonably, their depression lightened for a moment.... \n \n \"No! No sugar, Aunt Nelly.\" \n \n \"Do you want to be as thin as I am, Miss Laura?\" Arthur Weston remonstrated, watching her rub her cool cheek against her mother\u0027s, and kiss her aunt, and \"hook\" a sandwich from the tea-table. One had to smile at Laura; her mother smiled, even while she thought of the walk home, and realized, despairingly, that the car was coming—coming—and would be gone in a minute or two! \n \n \"My dear, your father says all this fuss about exercise is perfect nonsense. Really, I think we\u0027d better ride,\"[Pg 21] she pleaded with the pretty creature, who was asking, ruthlessly, for lemon, which meant another delay. \n \n \"I\u0027ll ring, Auntie; Flora will get it in a minute. Mama, I bet you haven\u0027t walked an inch this day! I knew you\u0027d take the car if I didn\u0027t come and drag you on to your legs,\" she ended, maliciously; but it was such pretty malice, and her face was so gayly amiable that her mother surrendered. \"The only thing that reconciles me to Billy-boy\u0027s being too poor to give us an auto,\" Laura said, gravely, \"is that Mama would weigh a ton if she rode everywhere. I bet you\u0027ve eaten six cream-cheese sandwiches, Mama? You\u0027ll gain a pound for each one!\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll be the death of me, Lolly,\" her mother sighed. \"I only ate three. Well, I\u0027ll stay a little longer, Ellen, and walk part way home with this child. She\u0027s a perfect tyrant,\" she added, with tender, scolding pride in the charming young creature, whose arch impertinence was irresistible. \n \n \"Take off your coat, my dear,\" Mrs. Payton said, patting her niece\u0027s hand, \"and go and look at my puzzle over on the table. Five hundred pieces! I\u0027m afraid it will take me a week yet to work it out;\"—then, in an aside: \"Laura, I\u0027m mortified that I should have asked Mr. Maitland the title of that book before you,\"—Laura opened questioning eyes;—\"so indelicate of Fred to tell him to read it! Oh, here\u0027s Flora with the lemon. Thank you, Flora.... Laura, do you know what Freddy is thinking of doing now?\" \n \n \"Yes, the real-estate business. It\u0027s perfectly corking! Howard Maitland says he thinks she\u0027s simply great to[Pg 22] do it. I only wish I could go into business and earn some money!\" \n \n \"My dear, if you will save some money in your own home, you will be just as well off,\" Mrs. Childs said, dryly. \n \n \"Better off,\" Mr. Weston ventured, \"but you won\u0027t have so much fun. This idea of Fred\u0027s is a pretty expensive way of earning money.\" \n \n \"You know about it?\" Mrs. Payton said, surprised. \n \n \"Oh, yes; she broke it to me yesterday.\" \n \n \"Just what is her idea?\" Mrs. Childs asked, with mild impatience. \n \n \"Let me explain it,\" Frederica\u0027s man of business said ... and proceeded to put the project into words of three letters, so to speak. Fred had hit on the fact that there are many ladies—lone females, Mr. Weston called them; who drift about looking for apartments;—\"nice old maids. I know two of them at this minute, the Misses Graham, cousins of mine in Grafton. They are going to spend the winter in town, and they want a furnished apartment. It must be near a drug-store and far enough from an Episcopal church to make a nice walk on Sundays—fair Sundays. And it must be on the street-car line, so that they can go to concerts, with, of course, a messenger-boy to escort them; for they \u0027don\u0027t mean to be a burden to a young man\u0027; that\u0027s me, I\u0027ll have you know! \u0027A young man\u0027! When a chap is forty-six that sounds very well. Fred proposes to find shelters for just such people.\" \n LET ME EXPLAIN IT \n \n \"LET ME EXPLAIN IT,\" FREDERICA\u0027S MAN OF BUSINESS SAID ... AND \n PROCEEDED TO PUT THE PROJECT INTO WORDS OF THREE LETTERS \n \n The two ladies were silent with dismay and ignorance. Laura, sucking a piece of lemon, and seeing a chance to[Pg 23] \"root,\" said, \"How bully to have an office! I\u0027m going to make her take me as office boy.\" \n \n \"The Lord only knows how she got the idea,\" Arthur Weston went on, \"but it isn\u0027t entirely bad. I confess I wish her ambition would content itself with a post-office address, but nothing short of a real office will satisfy her. She has her eye on one in the tenth story of the Sturtevant Building; I am on the third, you know. But I think she can do it all on her allowance, though rent and advertising will use up just about all her income.\" \n \n \"I will never consent to it,\" Mrs. Payton said, angrily. \"It is absurd, anyhow! Freddy, to hunt up houses for elderly ladies—Freddy, of all people! She knows no more about houses, or housekeeping, than—than that fire-screen! Just as an instance, I happened to tell her that I couldn\u0027t remember whether I had seventy-two best towels and eighty-four ordinary towels, or the other way round; I was really ashamed to have forgotten which it was, and I said that as soon as I got time I must count them. (Of course, I have the servants\u0027 towels, too; five dozen and four, with red borders to distinguish them.) And Freddy was positively insulting! She said women whose minds had stopped growing had to count towels for mental exercise. When I was a girl, I should have offered to count the towels for my mother! As for her finding apartments for elderly ladies, I would as soon trust a—a baby! Do you mean the Mason Grahams, Mr. Weston? Miss Eliza and Miss Mary? Mama knows them. You\u0027ve met them, too, haven\u0027t you, Bessie? Well, I can only say that I should be exceedingly mortified to have the Misses[Pg 24] Graham know that any Payton girl was behaving in such an extraordinary manner. The real-estate business! She might as well go out as a servant.\" \n \n \"She would make more money as a cook,\" he admitted. But he could not divert the stream of hurt and angry objections. Once Mrs. Childs said to tell Fred her uncle William would say it was perfect nonsense; and once Laura whispered to Mr. Weston that she thought it would be great sport to hunt flats for flatlings; to which he whispered back: \"Shoal. \u0027Ware shoal, Laura.\" \n \n There were many shoals in the distressed argument that followed, and even Arthur Weston\u0027s most careful steering could not save some bumps and crashes. In the midst of them the car came clattering down the street, and after a while went clattering back; and still the three elders wrangled over the outlaw\u0027s project, and Laura, sitting on the arm of her mother\u0027s chair, listened, giggling once in a while, and saying to herself that Mr. Weston was a perfect lamb—for there was no doubt about it, he, too, was \"rooting\" for Fred. \n \n \"I must go,\" Mrs. Childs said, at last, in a distressed voice. \"No, Lolly, we haven\u0027t time to walk; we must take the car. Oh, Ellen, I meant to ask you: can\u0027t you join my bridge club? There\u0027s going to be a vacancy, and I\u0027m sure you can learn—\" \n \n \"Oh, my dear, I couldn\u0027t possibly! I\u0027m so busy; I haven\u0027t a minute—\" \n \n \"Well, think it over,\" Mrs. Childs urged. \"And, Nelly dear, I know it will be all right about Fred. I\u0027m sure William would say so. Don\u0027t worry!\" \n \n [Pg 25] \n \n But when the door closed upon the escaping aunt and the sympathizing cousin, poor Mrs. Payton\u0027s worry overflowed into such endless details that at last her hearer gave up trying to comfort her. When he, too, made his escape, he was profoundly fatigued. His plea that Frederica should be allowed to burn her fingers so that she might learn the meaning of fire had not produced the slightest effect. To everything he said Mrs. Payton had opposed her outraged taste, her wounded love, her fixed belief in the duty of youth to age. When he ventured to quote that \n \"... it was better youth \n Should strive, through acts uncouth, \n Towards making, than repose on aught found made,\" \n \n she said poetry was all very well, but that, perhaps, if the poet or poetess who wrote that had had a daughter, they would think differently. When she was reminded that she, too, had had different ideas from those of her parents, she said, emphatically, never!—except in things where they had grown a little old-fashioned. \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe, when I was a girl, I ever crossed Mama in anything more important than in little matters of dress or furnishings.... Oh, do look at my puzzle before you go!\" \n \n But Arthur Weston, almost dizzy with the endless words, had fled. Down-stairs, while he hunted for his hat and coat, he paused to draw a long breath and throw out his arms, as if he would stretch his cramped mind, as well as his muscles, stiffened by long relaxing among the cushions of the big arm-chair. \n \n [Pg 26] \n \n \"Is there anything in this world duller than the pronunciamento of a dull woman!\" he said to himself. On the street, for sheer relief of feeling the cool air against his face, instead of the warm stillness of Mrs. Payton\u0027s sitting-room, he did not hail the approaching car, but strolled aimlessly along the pavement, sticky with fog. \n \n \"I wonder if she talks in her sleep?\" he said. \"I don\u0027t believe she ever stops! How can Fred stand it?\" He knew he couldn\u0027t stand it himself. \"I\u0027d sell pop-corn on the street corner, to get away from it—and from Andy\u0027s old stovepipe!\" It occurred to him that the ideals set forth in Mrs. Payton\u0027s ceaseless conversation were of the same era as the hat. \"But the hat would fit Fred best,\" he thought—\"Hello!\" he broke off, as, straining back on the leash of an exasperated Scotch terrier, a girl came swinging around the corner of the street and caromed into him so violently that he nearly lost his balance. \n \n \"Grab him, will you?\" she gasped; and when Mr. Weston had grabbed, and the terrier was sprawling abjectly under the discipline of a friendly cuff on his nose, she got her breath, and said, panting, \"Where do you spring from?\" \n \n It was Frederica Payton, her short serge skirt splashed with mud, and a lock of hair blown across her eyes. \"He\u0027s a wretch, that pup!\" she said. \"I\u0027ll give him to you for a present.\" \n \n \"I wouldn\u0027t deprive you of him for the world!\" he protested, in alarm. \"Here, let me have the leash.\" \n \n She relinquished it, and they walked back together toward Payton Street, Zip shambling meekly at their heels. \n \n [Pg 27] \n \n \"Well,\" she said, thrusting a confiding arm in his, \"were you able to move her? Or did she turn Aunt Bessie loose on you, too? I knew Aunt Bessie was to be asked to the funeral. I suppose she talked anti-suffrage, and quoted \u0027my William\u0027 every minute? Aunt Bessie hasn\u0027t had an idea of her own since the year one! Isn\u0027t it queer what stodgy minds middle-aged women have? I suppose you are about dead?\" \n \n \"I have felt more lively. Fred, why can\u0027t you see your mother\u0027s side of it?\" \n \n \"Why can\u0027t she see my side of it?\" \n \n \"But she thinks—\" \n \n \"But I think! What I object to in Mother is that she wants me to think her thoughts. Apart from the question of hypocrisy, I prefer my own.\" As she spoke, the light of a street lamp fell full on her face—a wolfish, unhumorous young face, pathetic with its hunger for life; he saw that her chin was twitching, and there was a wet gleam on one flushed cheek. \"Besides,\" she said, \"I simply won\u0027t go on spending my days as well as my nights in that house. You don\u0027t know what it means to live in the same house with—with—\" \n \n \"I wish you were married,\" he said, helplessly; \"that\u0027s the best way to get out of that house.\" \n \n She laughed, and squeezed his arm. \"You want to get off your job?\" she said, maliciously; \"well, you can\u0027t. I\u0027m the Old Man of the Sea, and you\u0027ll have to carry me on your back for the rest of your life. No marriage in mine, thank you!\" \n \n They were sauntering along now in the darkness, her[Pg 28] arm still in his, and her cheek, in her eagerness, almost touching his shoulder; her voice was flippantly bitter: \n \n \"I don\u0027t want a man; I want an occupation!\" \n \n \"But it isn\u0027t necessary, Fred. And besides, there are home duties.\" \n \n \"In our house? Name \u0027em! Shall I make the soap, or wait on the table and put Flora out of a job? Where people have any money at all, \u0027home duties,\u0027 so far as girls are concerned, are played out. Machinery is the cuckoo that has pushed women out of the nest of domesticity. I made that up,\" she added, with frank vanity. \"I haven\u0027t a blessed thing to do in my good home—I suppose you heard that I had a \u0027good home\u0027? which means a roof, and food, so far as I can make out. But as there is something besides eating and sleeping in this life, I am going to get busy outside of my \u0027good home\u0027!\" \n \n He thought of the towels, but only murmured vaguely that there were things a girl could do which were not quite so—so— \n \n \"\u0027Unwomanly\u0027? That\u0027s Mother\u0027s word. Grandmother\u0027s is \u0027unladylike.\u0027 No, sir! I\u0027ve done all the nice, \u0027womanly\u0027 things that girls who live at home have to do to kill time. I\u0027ve painted—can\u0027t paint any more than Zip! And I\u0027ve slummed. I hate poor people, they smell so. And I\u0027ve taken singing lessons; I have about as much voice as a crow. My Suffrage League isn\u0027t work, it\u0027s fun. I might have tried nursing, but Grandmother had a fit; that \u0027warm heart\u0027 she\u0027s always handing out couldn\u0027t stand the idea of relieving male suffering. \u0027What!\u0027 she said, \u0027see a [Pg 29]gentleman entirely undressed, in his bed!\u0027 I said, \u0027It would be much more alarming to see him entirely dressed in his bed\u0027!\" She paused, her eyes narrowing thoughtfully; \"it\u0027s queer about Grandmother—I don\u0027t really dislike her. She makes me mad, because she\u0027s such an awful old liar; but she\u0027s no fool.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s a concession. I hope you\u0027ll make as much for me.\" \n \n \"They were poor when she was a girl, and she had to do things—household things, I mean; really had to. So she has stuff in her; and, in her way, she\u0027s a good sport. But she is narrow and coarse. \u0027See a gentleman in his bed!\u0027 And she thinks she\u0027s modest! But poor dear Mother simply died on the spot when I mentioned nursing. So I gave that up. Well, I have to admit I wasn\u0027t very keen for it; I don\u0027t like sick people, dressed or undressed.\" \n \n \"They don\u0027t like themselves very much, Fred.\" \n \n \"I suppose they don\u0027t,\" she said, absently. \"Well, nursing really wasn\u0027t my bat, so I have nothing against Mother on that lay. But you see, I\u0027ve tried all the conventional things, and I\u0027ve made up my mind to cut \u0027em out. Business is the thing for me. Business!\" \n \n \"But isn\u0027t there a question of duty?\" he said. \n \n \"Do you mean to Mortimore? Poor wretch! That\u0027s what Mother harps on from morning to night. What duty have I to Mortimore? I\u0027m not responsible for him. I didn\u0027t bring him here. Mother has a duty to him, I grant you. She owes him—good Lord! how much she owes him! Apologies, to begin with. What right had she and \u0027old Andy Payton\u0027 to bring him into the world?[Pg 30] I should think they would have been ashamed of themselves. Father was old and dissipated; and there was an uncle of his, you know, like Mortimore. His \u0027intellect was there,\u0027 too, but it was very decidedly \u0027veiled\u0027! I suppose Mother worked the \u0027veiled intellect\u0027 off on you?\" \n \n They had reached the Payton house by this time, and Frederica, her hand on the gate, paused in the rainy dusk and looked into Arthur Weston\u0027s face, with angry, unabashed eyes. \"Don\u0027t talk to me about a duty to Mortimore!\" \n \n \"I meant a duty to your mother. Think of what you owe your mother.\" \n \n \"What do I owe her? Life! Did I ask for life? Was I consulted? Before I am grateful for life, you\u0027ve got to prove that I\u0027ve liked living. So far, I haven\u0027t. Who would, with Mortimore in the house? When I was a child I couldn\u0027t have girls come and see me for fear he would come shuffling about.\" He saw her shoulders twitch with the horror of that shuffling. \"It makes me tired, this rot about a child\u0027s gratitude and duty to a parent! It\u0027s the other way round, as I look at it; the parent owes the child a lot more than the child owes the parent. Did \u0027old Andy\u0027 and Mama bring me into this world for my pleasure? You know they didn\u0027t. \u0027Duty to parents\u0027—that talk won\u0027t go down,\" she said, harshly, and snapped the gate shut between them. \n \n He looked at her helplessly. She was wrong, but much of what she had said was right,—or, rather, accurate. But when, in all the history of parenthood, had there been a time when children accused their fathers and mothers[Pg 31] of selfishness, and cited their own existence as a proof of that selfishness! \"Your mother will be very lonely,\" he said. \n \n She shook her head. \"Mother doesn\u0027t need me in the least. A puzzle of a thousand pieces is a darned sight more interesting than I am.\" \n \n \"You are a puzzle in one piece,\" he said. \n \n \"I\u0027m not as much use to Mother as Father\u0027s old silk hat down in the hall; I never scared a burglar yet. I tell you what, Mother and I have about as much in common as—as Zip and that awful iron dog! Mother thinks she is terribly noble because she devotes herself to Mortimore. Mr. Weston, she enjoys devoting herself! She says she\u0027s doing her duty. I suppose she is, though I would call it instinct, not duty. Anyhow, there\u0027s nothing noble about it. It\u0027s just nature. Mother is like a cat or a cow; they adore their offspring. And they have a perfect right to lick \u0027em all over, or anything else that expresses cat-love. But you don\u0027t say they are \u0027noble\u0027 when they lick \u0027em! And cows don\u0027t insist that other cows shall lick calves that are not theirs. Mortimore isn\u0027t mine. Yes; that\u0027s where Mother isn\u0027t as sensible as a cow. She can give herself up all she wants to, but she sha\u0027n\u0027t give me up. I won\u0027t lick Mortimore!\" She was quivering, and her eyes were tragic. \"Why, Flora has more in common with me than Mother, for Flora is at least dissatisfied—poor old Flora! Whereas Mother is as satisfied as a vegetable. That\u0027s why she\u0027s an anti. No; she isn\u0027t even a vegetable; vegetables grow! Mother\u0027s mind stopped growing when her first baby was born. Mother[Pg 32] and I don\u0027t speak the same language. I don\u0027t suppose she means to be cruel,\" she ended, \"but she is.\" \n \n \"Did it ever occur to you that you are cruel?\" \n \n She winced at that; he saw her bite her lip, and for a moment she did not speak. Then she burst out: \"That\u0027s the worst of it. I am cruel. I say things—and then, afterward, I could kick myself. Yet they are true. What can I do? I tell the truth, and then I feel as if I had—had kicked Zip in the stomach!\" \n \n \"Stop kicking Zip anywhere,\" he admonished her; \"it\u0027s bad taste.\" \n \n \"But if I don\u0027t speak out, I\u0027ll bust!\" \n \n \"Well, bust,\" he said, dryly; \"that\u0027s better than kicking Zip.\" \n \n Her face broke into a grin, and she leaned over the gate to give his arm a squeeze. \"I don\u0027t know how I\u0027d get along without you,\" she told him. \"Darn that pup!\" she said, and dashed after Zip\u0027s trailing leash. \n \n Arthur Weston, looking after her, laughed, and waved his hand. \"How young she is! Well, I\u0027ll put the office business through for her.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1821/52851.html","bookId":1026,"book":{"id":1026,"title":"The Rising Tide","description":"简介： A single car-track ran through Payton Street, and over it, once in a while, a small car jogged along, drawn by two mules.
