{"id":36694,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I","content":"A single car-track ran through Payton Street, and over it, once in a while, a small car jogged along, drawn by two mules. Thirty years ago Payton Street had been shocked by the intrusion upon its gentility of a thing so noisy and vulgar as a street-car; but now, when the rest of the town was shuttled with trolleys and clamorous with speed, it seemed to itself an oasis of silence. Its gentility had ebbed long ago. The big houses, standing a little back from the sidewalk, were given over to lodgers or small businesses. Indeed, the Paytons were the only people left who belonged to Payton Street\u0027s past—and there was a barber shop next door to them, and a livery-stable across the street. \"Rather different from the time when your dear father brought me here, a bride,\" Mrs. Payton used to say, sighing. Her daughter agreed, dryly: \"I hope so! Certainly nobody would live on Payton Street now, if they could afford to buy a lot in the cemetery.\" Yet the Paytons, who could have bought several lots[Pg 2] in the cemetery (or over on the Hill, either, which was where they belonged!), did not leave the old house—a big, brownstone cube, with a belvedere on top of it that looked like a bird-cage. The yard in front of the house was so shaded by ailanthus-trees that grass refused to grow there, and an iron dog, guarding the patch of bare earth, was spotted with mold. The street was very quiet,—except when the barber\u0027s children squabbled shrilly, or Baker\u0027s livery-stable sent out a few funeral hacks, or when, from a barred window in the ell of the Payton house, there came a noisy laugh. And always, on the half-hour, the two mules went tinkling along, their neat little feet cupping down over the cobblestones, and their trace-chains swinging and sagging about their heels. The conductor on the car had been on the route so long that he knew many of his patrons, and nodded to them in a friendly way, and said it was a good day, or too cold for the season; occasionally he imparted information which he thought might be of interest to them. On this October afternoon of brown fog and occasional dashes of rain he enlightened a lady with a vaguely sweet face, who signaled him to stop at No. 15. \"Miss Payton\u0027s out,\" he said, pulling the strap over his head and bringing his car to a standstill; \"but her ma\u0027s at home. I brought the old lady back on my last trip, just as Miss Freddy was starting off with that pup of hers.\" \"It\u0027s the \u0027old lady\u0027 I\u0027ve come to see,\" his fare said, smiling, and, gathering up her skirts, stepped down into[Pg 3] the Payton Street mud. The bell jangled and the mules went clattering off over the cobblestones. Mrs. William Childs, picking her way to the sidewalk, said to herself that she almost wished Freddy and her dog were at home, instead of the \"old lady.\" \"Poor dear Ellen,\" she thought, in amiable detachment from other people\u0027s troubles; \"she\u0027s always asking me to sit in judgment on Fred—and there\u0027s nothing on earth I can do.\" It occurred to her as she passed under the dripping ailanthus-trees and up the white marble door-steps that Payton Street was a gloomy place for a young creature like Frederica to live. \"Even my Laura would kick,\" she thought; her thoughts were often in her Laura\u0027s vernacular. In the dark hall, clutching at the newel-post on which an Egyptian maiden held aloft a gas-burner in a red globe, she extended a foot to a melancholy mulatto woman, who removed her rubbers and then hung her water-proof on the rack beside a silk hat belonging to the late Mr. Payton—kept there, Mrs. Childs knew, to frighten perennially expected burglars. \"Thank you, Flora,\" she said. \"Has Mr. Weston come yet?\" When Flora explained that Mr. Weston was not expected until later, she started up-stairs—then hesitated, her hand on the shoulder of the Egyptian maiden: \"Mr. Mortimore—he\u0027s not about?\" \"Land, no, Mis\u0027 Childs!\" the woman reassured her; \"he don\u0027t ever come down \u0027thout his ma or Miss Carter\u0027s along with him.\" Mrs. Childs nodded in a relieved way, and went on up[Pg 4] to the sitting-room where, as she had been warned, she and Mr. Arthur Weston, one of the trustees of what was popularly known as \"the old Andy Payton estate,\" were to \"sit in judgment.\" \"It is hard for Fred to have Mortimore in the house,\" she thought, kindly; \"poor Freddy!\" The sitting-room was in the ell, and pausing on the landing at the steps that led up to it, she looked furtively beyond it, toward another room at the end of the hall. \"I wonder if Ellen ever forgets to lock the door on her side?\" she thought;—\"well, Nelly dear, how are you?\" she called out, cheerfully. Mrs. Payton, bustling forward to meet her, overflowed with exclamations of gratitude for her visit. \"And such unpleasant weather, too! I do hope you didn\u0027t get your feet damp? I always tell Freddy there is no surer way to take cold than to get your feet damp. Of course she doesn\u0027t believe me, but I\u0027m used to that! Is William\u0027s cold better? I suppose he\u0027s glad of an excuse to stay indoors and read about Bacon and Shakespeare; which was which? I never can remember! Now sit right down here. No, take this chair!\" The caller, moving from one chair to another, was perfectly docile; it was Ellen\u0027s way, and Mrs. Childs had long ago discovered the secret of a peaceful life, namely, always, so far as possible, to let other people have their own way. She looked about the sitting-room, and thought that her sister-in-law was very comfortable. \"Laura would have teased me to death if I had kept my old-fashioned things,\" she reflected. The room was feminine as well as old-fashioned; the deeply upholstered chairs[Pg 5] and couches were covered with flounced and flowery chintz; on a green wire plant-stand, over-watered ferns grew daily more scraggy and anemic; the windows were smothered in lambrequins and curtains, and beadwork valances draped corner brackets holding Parian marble statuettes; of course there was the usual womanish clutter of photographs in silver frames. On the center-table a slowly evolving picture puzzle had pushed a few books to one side—pretty little books with pretty names, Flowers of Peace and Messages from Heaven, most of them with the leaves still uncut. It was an eminently comfortable room; indeed, next to her conception of duty, the most important thing in Mrs. Andrew Payton\u0027s life was comfort. Just now, she was tenaciously solicitous for Mrs. Childs\u0027s ease; was she warm enough? Wasn\u0027t the footstool a little too high? And the fire—dear me! the fire was too hot! She must put up the screen. She wouldn\u0027t make tea until Mr. Weston came; yes, he had promised to come; she had written him, frankly, that he had simply got to do something about Freddy. \"He\u0027s her trustee, as well as mine, and I told him he simply must do something about this last wild idea of hers. Now! isn\u0027t it better to have the screen in front of the fire?\" Mrs. Childs said the screen was most comfortable; then added, in uncertain reminiscence, \"Wasn\u0027t Mr. Weston jilted ages ago by some Philadelphia girl?\" \"Oh, dear, yes; so sad. Kate Morrison. She ran off with somebody else just a week before they were to be married. Horribly awkward for him; the invitations all[Pg 6] out! He went to Europe, and was agent for Payton\u0027s until dear Andrew died. You are quite sure you are not too warm?\" \"No, indeed!\" Mrs. Childs said. \"How is Mortimore?\" It was a perfunctory question, but its omission would have pained Mortimore\u0027s mother. \"Very well!\" Mrs. Payton said; her voice challenging any one to suspect anything wrong with Mortimore\u0027s health. \"He knew Freddy to-day; he was in the hall when she went out; he can\u0027t bear her dog, and he—he scolded a little. I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t blame him! I hate dogs, myself. But he knew her; Miss Carter told me about it when I came in. I was so pleased.\" \"That was very nice,\" her visitor said, kindly. There was a moment\u0027s silence; then, glancing toward a closed door that connected the sitting-room with that room at the end of the ell, she said, hesitatingly: \"Nelly dear, don\u0027t you think that perhaps Freddy wouldn\u0027t be so difficult, if poor Mortimore were not at home? William says he thinks—\" \"My son shall never leave this house as long as I am in it myself!\" Mrs. Payton interrupted, her face flushing darkly red. \"But it is unpleasant for Fred, and—\" \"\u0027Unpleasant\u0027 to have her poor afflicted brother in the house? Bessie, I wouldn\u0027t have thought such a thing of you! Let me tell you, once for all, as I\u0027ve told you many, many times before—never, while I live, shall Mortimore be treated cruelly and turned out of his own home!\" [Pg 7] \"But William says they are not cruel, at—at those places; and Mortimore, poor boy! would never know the difference.\" \"He would! He would! Didn\u0027t I tell you he recognized his sister to-day? His sister, who cares more for her dog than she does for him! And he almost always knows me. Bessie, you don\u0027t understand how a mother feels—\" she had risen and was walking about the room, her fat, worn face sharpening with a sort of animal alertness into power and protection. The claws that hide in every maternal creature slipped out of the fur of good manners: \"We\u0027ve gone all over this a hundred times; I know that you think I am a fool; and I think that you—well, never mind! The amount of it is, you are not a mother.\" \"My dear! What about my three children?\" \"Three healthy children! What do you know of the real child, the afflicted child, like my Mortimore? Why, I\u0027d see Freddy in her grave before I\u0027d—\" She stopped short. \"I—I love both my children exactly the same,\" she ended, weakly. Then broke out again: \"You and I were brought up to do our duty, and not talk about it whether it was pleasant or unpleasant. And let me tell you, if Freddy would do her duty to her brother, as old Aunt Adelaide did to her invalid brother, she\u0027d be a thousand times happier than she is now, mixing up with perfectly common people, and talking about earning her own living! Yes, that\u0027s the last bee in her bonnet,—Working! a girl with a good home, and nothing on earth to do but amuse herself. She uses really vulgar words[Pg 8] about women who never worked for their living; you and me, for instance. \u0027Vermin\u0027—no, \u0027parasites.\u0027 Disgusting! Yes; if Freddy was like her great-aunt Adelaide—\" Mrs. Payton, sinking into a chair bubbly with springs and down, was calmer, but she wiped her eyes once or twice: \"Aunt Adelaide gave up her life to poor Uncle Henry. Everybody says she had lots of beaux! I heard she had seven offers. But she never dreamed of getting married. She just lived for her brother. And they say he was dreadful, Bessie; whereas my poor Mortimore is only—not quite like other people.\" Mrs. Childs gasped. \"When Morty was six months old,\" Mrs. Payton said, in a tense voice, \"and we began to be anxious about him, Andrew said to the doctor, \u0027I suppose the brat\u0027 (you know men speak so frankly) \u0027has no brains?\u0027 and Dr. Davis said, \u0027The intellect is there, Mr. Payton, but it is veiled.\u0027 That has always been such a comfort to me; Morty\u0027s intellect is there! And besides, you must remember, Bessie, that even if he isn\u0027t—very intelligent, he\u0027s a man, so he\u0027s really the head of the family. As for Freddy, as I say, if she would follow her aunt Adelaide\u0027s example, instead of reading horrid books about things that when I was a young lady, girls didn\u0027t know existed, she\u0027d be a good deal more comfortable to live with. Oh, dear! what am I going to do about her? As I wrote to Mr. Weston, when I asked him to come in this afternoon, what are we going to do about her?\" \"What has poor Fred done now?\" Fred\u0027s aunt asked, trying patiently to shut off the torrent of talk. Mrs. Payton drew a long breath; her chin was still[Pg 9] unsteady. \"It isn\u0027t so much this last performance, because, of course, in spite of what Mama says, everybody who knows Freddy, knows that there was—nothing wrong. But it\u0027s her ideas, and the way she talks. Really, Bessie—\" \"My dear, they all talk most unpleasantly!\" Mrs. Payton shook her fair head. \"Your Laura doesn\u0027t. I never heard Lolly say the sort of things Freddy does. She calls her father \u0027Billy-boy,\u0027 I know, but that\u0027s only fun—though in our day, imagine us calling our fathers by a nickname! No, Bessie, it\u0027s Freddy\u0027s taste. It\u0027s positively low! There is a Mrs. McKenzie, a scrubwoman out at the Inn, and she is—you know? It will be the seventh, and they really can hardly feed the six they have. And Freddy, a young girl, actually told Mrs. McKenzie she ought not to have so many children!\" \"Well, Ellen, if there are too many now, it does seem—\" \"But, Bessie! A girl to speak of such things! Why, you and I, before we were married, didn\u0027t know—still, there\u0027s no use harking back to our girlhood. And as for the things she says!... Yesterday I was speaking of the Rev. Mr. Tait, and she said: \u0027I haven\u0027t any use for Tait; he has no guts to him.\u0027\" Mrs. Childs was mildly horrified. \"But it\u0027s only bad taste,\" she excused her niece. She was fond of this poor, troubled sister-in-law of hers—but really, what was the use of fussing so over mere bad taste? Over really serious things, such as keeping that dreadful Mortimore about, Ellen didn\u0027t fuss at all! \"How queer she is,\" Mrs. Childs reflected, impersonal, but kindly; then murmured that if[Pg 10] she had been unhappy about her children\u0027s slang, she\u0027d have been in her grave by this time; \"You should hear my boys! And, after all, Ellen, Fred\u0027s a good child, in spite of this thing she\u0027s done (you haven\u0027t told me what it is yet). She\u0027s merely like all the rest of them—thinks she knows it all. Well, we did, too, at her age, only we didn\u0027t say so. Sometimes I think they are more straightforward than we were. But I made up my mind, years ago, that there was no use trying to run the children on my ideas. Criticism only provoked them, and made me wretched, and accomplished nothing. So, as William says, why fuss?\" \"Fred is my daughter, so I have to \u0027fuss.\u0027\" \"Well,\" said Mrs. Childs, patiently, \"what is it?\" \"Hasn\u0027t Laura told you? Mama says everybody is talking about it.\" \"No; she hasn\u0027t said anything.\" \"My dear, Freddy spent the night at the Inn, with Howard Maitland.\" \"What!\" \"His car broke down—\" \"Oh, an accident? You can\u0027t blame Fred for that. But why didn\u0027t they take the trolley?\" \"They just missed the last car.\" \"Well, they were two careless children, but you wouldn\u0027t have had them walk into town, twelve miles, at twelve o\u0027clock at night?\" \"I certainly would! Freddy is always telling me I ought to walk to keep my weight down—so why didn\u0027t she walk home? And as for their being children, she is twenty-five and I am sure he is twenty-seven.\" [Pg 11] She paused here to wonder about Mr. Maitland: curious that he liked to live alone in that big house on the hill! Pity he hadn\u0027t any relatives—a maiden aunt, or anybody who could keep house for him. His mother was a sweet little thing. Nice that he had money. \"He ought to marry,\" said Mrs. Childs. \"Of course,\" said Mrs. Payton; and dropped young Maitland to go back to the Inn escapade: \"Mama was so shocked when she heard about it that she thought William ought to go and see Mr. Maitland and tell him he must marry her. Of course, that is absurd—Mama belongs to another generation. Freddy did take the trouble to telephone me; but Flora took the message—poor Flora! she\u0027s so dissatisfied and low-spirited. I wish she\u0027d \u0027get religion\u0027—that keeps servants contented. Miss Carter says she\u0027s in love with one of the men at the livery-stable. But he isn\u0027t very devoted. Well, I was in bed with a headache (I\u0027ve been dreadfully busy this week, and pretty tired, and besides, I had worked all the evening on a puzzle, and I was perfectly worn out); so Flora didn\u0027t tell me, and I didn\u0027t know Freddy hadn\u0027t come home until the next morning. It appears she was advising Mrs. McKenzie as to the size of her family, and when Mr. Maitland found he couldn\u0027t make his motor go, and told her they must take the trolley, she just kept on instructing Mrs. McKenzie! So they missed the car. She admitted that it was her fault. Well, then—oh, here is Mr. Weston!\" He came into the room, dusky with the fog that was pressing against the windows, like a slender shadow; a[Pg 12] tall, rather delicate-looking man in the late forties, with a handsome, whimsical face, which endeavored, just now, to conceal its boredom. \"Criminal not present?\" he said, shaking hands with the two ladies and peering near-sightedly about. \"Oh, she\u0027s off with her dog, walking miles and miles, to keep from getting fat,\" Mrs. Payton said. She sat down at her tea-table, and tried, fussily, to light the lamp under the kettle. \"It\u0027s wicked to be fat, you know,\" she ended, with resentful sarcasm; \"I wish you could hear Fred talk about it!\" \"I wish I could,\" Frederica\u0027s man of business said, lifting a humorous eyebrow; \"I always like to hear Fred talk. Let me fix that lamp for you, Mrs. Payton. I hope I\u0027m thin enough to be moral?\" The two ladies regarded him with maternal eyes, and Mrs. Childs recommended a glass of milk at bedtime. \"Be sure it is pasteurized,\" she warned him; \"my William always says it\u0027s perfect nonsense to fuss about that—but I say it\u0027s only prudent.\" \"Must I pasteurize my whisky, too?\" he said, meekly; \"I sometimes take that at bedtime.\" It occurred to him that when he had the chance he would tell Freddy that what with pasteurized milk, and all the other improvements upon Nature, her children would be supermen; \"they\u0027ll say they were evolved from us,\" he reflected, sipping his tea, and listening to his hostess\u0027s outpourings about her daughter, \"as we say we were evolved from monkeys.\" Not that Mrs. Payton—telling him, with endless [Pg 13]illustrations, just how \"impossible\" her Freddy was—looked in the least like a monkey; she was a large, fair, dull lady, of fifty-seven or thereabouts, who never took any exercise, and credited the condition of her liver to Providence; but she was nearly as far removed from Miss Frederica Payton as she was from those arboreal ancestors, the very mention of whom would have shocked her religious principles, for Mrs. Payton was very truly and humbly religious. \"And church—Freddy never goes to church,\" she complained. \"She plays tennis all Sunday morning. Rather different from our day, isn\u0027t it, Bessie? We children were never allowed even to read secular books on Sunday. Well, I think it was better than the laxity of the present. We always wore our best dresses to church, and—\" \"May I have some more tea, Mrs. Payton?\" her auditor murmured, and, the tide of reminiscence thus skilfully dammed, Freddy\u0027s offense was finally revealed to him. \"Well,\" he said,—\"yes, cream please; a great deal! I hope it\u0027s pasteurized?—they were stupid to lose the car. Fred told me all about it yesterday; it appears she was talking to some poor woman about the size of her family\"—the two ladies exchanged horrified glances;—\"of course, Maitland ought to have broken in on eugenics and hustled her off. But an accident isn\u0027t one of the seven deadly sins, and—\" \"Oh,\" Fred\u0027s mother interrupted, \"of course there was nothing wrong.\" Mr. Weston looked at her admiringly; she really conceived it necessary to say such a thing! Those denied[Pg 14] ancestors of hers could hardly have been more direct. It occurred to him, reaching for another lump of sugar, that Frederica came by her talent for free speech honestly. \"With her mother, it is free thought. Fred goes one better, that\u0027s all,\" he reflected, dreamily. Once or twice, while the complaints flowed steadily on, he roused himself from his amused abstraction to murmur sympathetic disapproval: \"Of course she ought not to say things like that—\" \"She is impossible!\" Mrs. Payton sighed. \"Why, she said \u0027Damn,\u0027 right out, before the Rev. Mr. Tait!\" \"Did she damn Tait? I know him, and really—\" \"Well, no; I think it was the weather. But that is nothing to the way she talks about old people.\" \"About me, perhaps?\" \"Oh no; really, no! About you?\" Mrs. Payton stammered; \"why—how could she say anything about you?\" Arthur Weston\u0027s eyes twinkled. (\"I\u0027ll make her tell me what it was,\" he promised himself.) \"As for age,\" Mrs. Childs corroborated, \"she seems to have no respect for it. She spoke quite rudely to her uncle William about Shakespeare and Bacon. She said the subject \u0027bored\u0027 her.\" Mr. Weston shook his head, speechless. \"And she said,\" Mrs. Childs went on, her usual detachment sharpening for a moment into personal displeasure, \"she said the antis had no brains; and she knows I\u0027m an anti!\" \"Oh, my dear,\" Fred\u0027s mother condoled, \"I\u0027m an anti, and she says shocking things to me; once she said the[Pg 15] antis were—I really can\u0027t say just what she said before Mr. Weston; but she implied they were—merely mothers. And as for her language! I was saying how perfectly shocked my dear old friend, Miss Maria Spencer, was over this Inn escapade; Miss Maria said that if it were known that Freddy had spent the night at the Inn with Mr. Maitland her reputation would be gone.\" Mr. Weston\u0027s lips drew up for a whistle, but he frowned. \"I told Freddy, and what do you suppose she said? Really, I hesitate to repeat it.\" \"But dear Ellen,\" Mrs. Childs broke in, \"it was horrid in Miss Spencer to say such a thing! I don\u0027t wonder Freddy was provoked.\" \"She brought it on herself,\" Mrs. Payton retorted. \"Have another sandwich, Bessie? What she said is almost too shocking to quote. She said of my dear old friend—Miss Spencer used to be my school-teacher, Mr. Weston—\u0027What difference does it make what she said about me? Everybody knows Miss Spencer is a silly old ass.\u0027 \u0027A silly old ass.\u0027 What do you think of that?\" Mrs. Payton\u0027s voice trembled so with indignation that she did not hear Mr. Weston\u0027s gasp of laughter. But as she paused, wounded and ashamed, he was quick to console her: \"It was abominably disrespectful!\" \"There is no such thing as reverence left in the world,\" said Mrs. Childs; \"my William says he doesn\u0027t know what we are coming to.\" \"Youth is very cruel,\" Mr. Weston said. Mrs. Payton\u0027s eyes filled. \"Freddy is cruel,\" she said,[Pg 16] simply. The wounded look in her worn face was pitiful. They both tried to comfort her; they denounced Freddy, and wondered at her, and agreed with Mr. Childs that \"nobody knew what we were coming to.\" In fact, they said every possible thing except the one thing which, with entire accuracy, they might have said, namely, that Miss Spencer was a silly old ass. \"When I was a young lady,\" Mrs. Payton said, \"respect for my elders would have made such words impossible.\" \"Even if you didn\u0027t respect them, you would have been respectful?\" Mr. Weston suggested. \"We reverenced age because it was age,\" she agreed. \"Yes; in those happy days respect was not dependent upon desert,\" he said, ruefully. (Mrs. Childs looked at him uneasily; just what did he mean by that?) \"It must have been very comfortable,\" he ruminated, \"to be respected when you didn\u0027t deserve to be! This new state of things I don\u0027t like at all; I find that they size me up as I am, these youngsters, not as what they ought to think I am. One of my nephews told me the other day that I didn\u0027t know what I was talking about.\" \"Oh, my dear Mr. Weston, how shocking!\" Mrs. Payton sympathized. \"Well, as it happened, I didn\u0027t,\" he said, mildly; \"but how outrageous for the cub to recognize the fact.\" \"Perfectly outrageous!\" said his hostess. \"But it\u0027s just as Bessie says, they don\u0027t know the meaning of the word \u0027respect.\u0027 You should hear Freddy talk about her grandmother. The other day when I told her that my[Pg 17] dear mother said that if women had the ballot, chivalry would die out and men wouldn\u0027t take off their hats in elevators when ladies were present,—she said, \u0027Grandmother belongs to the generation of women who were satisfied to have men retain their vices, if they removed their hats.\u0027 What do you think of that! I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know what Freddy\u0027s father would have said if he had heard his daughter say such a thing about his mother-in-law.\" Mr. Weston, having known the late Andy Payton, thought it unwise to quote the probable comment of the deceased. Instead, he tried to change the subject: \"Howard Maitland is a nice chap; I wonder if—\" he paused; there was a scuffle on the other side of the closed door, a bellowing laugh, then a whine. Mrs. Childs bit her lip and shivered. Mr. Weston\u0027s face was inscrutable. \"I wonder,\" he continued, raising his voice—\"if Fred will smile on Maitland? By the way, I hear he is going in for conchology seriously.\" \"Mortimore is nervous this afternoon,\" Mrs. Payton said, hurriedly; \"that horrid puppy worried him. Conchology means shells, doesn\u0027t it? Freddy says he has a great collection of shells. I was thinking of sending him that old conch-shell I used to use to keep the parlor door open. Do you remember, Bessie? Yes, Mr. Maitland is attentive, but I don\u0027t know how serious it is. Of course, I\u0027m the last person to know! Rather different from the time when a young man asked the girl\u0027s parents if he might pay his addresses, isn\u0027t it? Well, I want to tell you what she said when I spoke to her about this plan of[Pg 18] earning her living (that\u0027s her latest fad, Mr. Weston), and told her that, as Mama says, it isn\u0027t done; she—\" \"Oh, dear! There\u0027s the car coming,\" Mrs. Childs broke in, as the tinkle of the mules\u0027 bells made itself heard. \"Do hurry and tell us, Nelly; I\u0027ve got to go.\" \"But you mustn\u0027t! I want to know what you think about it all,\" Mrs. Payton said, distractedly; \"wait for the next car.\" \"I\u0027m so sorry, dear Ellen, but I really can\u0027t,\" her sister-in-law declared, rising. \"Cheer up! I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll settle down if she cares about Mr. Maitland. (I\u0027m out of it!\" she was thinking.) But even as she was congratulating herself, she was lost, for from the landing a fresh young voice called out: \"May I come in, Aunt Nelly? How do you do, Mr. Weston! Mama, I came to catch you and make you walk home. Mama has got to walk, she\u0027s getting so fat! Aunt Nelly, Howard Maitland is here; I met him on the door-step and brought him in.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1821/52850.html","bookId":1026,"book":{"id":1026,"title":"The Rising Tide","description":"简介： A single car-track ran through Payton Street, and over it, once in a while, a small car jogged along, drawn by two mules.
