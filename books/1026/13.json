{"id":36706,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII","content":"On the first of June Frederica transferred herself and a somewhat reluctant Flora from Payton Street to Lakeville. \n \n \"Flora thinks her beau won\u0027t go out there to see her,\" Miss Carter explained. \n \n \"Nonsense!\" Fred said. \"If he wants to see her he\u0027ll come, and if he doesn\u0027t want to see her she\u0027d better find it out now.\" But she was not entirely unsympathetic, and told Flora there would be a piano in the cottage so that the music lessons could be continued—which raised the cloud a little. \n \n A day or two later Mrs. Holmes called at No. 15 to bid Mrs. Payton good-by for the summer, and the next week the Childses dropped in, in the evening, for the same purpose. They all made their annual remark: \"How can you stay in town in the hot weather?\" And Mrs. Payton made her annual reply: \"I hate summer resorts. I\u0027m much more comfortable in my own house.\" Nobody asked the real question, \"How can you stay here with Morty?\" And Mrs. Payton never gave the real explanation: \"My life is perfectly empty except for Mortimore; that\u0027s why I stay with him.\" \n \n When they had all left town Mrs. Payton, who changed[Pg 146] her under-flannels and packed up her winter blankets by the calendar, put the stuffed furniture into linen covers, and told Anne to keep the shutters bowed all over the house—except in the ell; the sun was never shut out of the room with the iron bars over the windows. Then summer sleepiness took possession of the household. No one disturbed the quiet except when, occasionally, Arthur Weston, bored and kindly, dropped in to ask for a cup of tea. He told himself once, after a dull hour of drinking very hot tea and listening to plaintive details of Freddy\u0027s behavior, that he was going to leave directions in his will to have inscribed upon his tombstone, \"He seen his duty, and he done it.\" It occurred to him that he would not wait for the tombstone to suggest that same duty to Frederica.... \n \n As the Payton house fell into somnolence, Payton Street woke up. The air, stagnant between sun-baked brick walls, was a medley of noises that sometimes sank to a rumbling diapason, or sometimes stabbed the ear in single discords: the jangle of mule-bells, the bumping of the car on the switch, the jolt of milk-wagons over the cobblestones. In the provision-store all day long a parrot vociferated; from the livery-stable came the monotonous pounding of hoofs, or, when Mr. Baker sent out a hearse and some funeral hacks, the screech of grating wheels. Hand-organs came and went. Fruit-dealers cried their wares—\"Strawberries! Strawberries! Strawb—\" The ailanthus-shaded pavements swarmed with shrill-voiced children; they summoned one another to pull the parrot\u0027s tail or to look at the hearse; they assailed the ice-carts,[Pg 147] reveling in the drip from the tail-boards and sucking what bits of ice they could scrape up. Sometimes they squabbled raucously, sometimes wept; sometimes, hushing their betraying giggles, crept into Mrs. Payton\u0027s front yard and climbed up on the iron dog \"to play circus\"—until Mrs. Payton, always on the watch, discovered them and sent Miss Carter down to drive them away. \n \n Except for skirmishes with the marauding children, Mrs. Payton\u0027s days were very placid. She worked out new puzzles and dozed through stories in the magazines. She wrote twice a week dutiful letters to her mother, pausing occasionally to think of something to say or to listen, absently, to the swish of the watering-cart along the street; she liked the wet smell of the watered cobblestones mingling with the heavy odor of the blossoming ailanthus. There never seemed to be anything to tell Mrs. Holmes, except that she had been dreadfully busy, and that the \"accommodating\" waitress didn\u0027t keep her sink clean, and that the barber\u0027s children were very trying. Every fine afternoon, sitting opposite Miss Carter and Morty, she drove out to the park and home again. Once she summoned up all her energy and went to Lakeville to spend a day with Fred. She thought that if she didn\u0027t go, Freddy would believe she preferred to stay with Morty. (\"Oh, if I only hadn\u0027t told her I loved him best!\" she used to reproach herself.) It was a bitter thing to Mrs. Payton to pass through Laketon and see the place where a Payton girl ought to be, \"instead of living with all kinds of people in Lakeville!\" When Fred met her at the station and brought her to the ugly little cottage—its garish interior[Pg 148] vivid, now, with yellow pennons—she tried, for the sake of peace, to restrain her disapproval of everything she saw, but she couldn\u0027t help saying she wondered how Fred could stand the solferino lamp-shade. \n \n \"Hideous,\" Frederica said, carelessly, \"so why look at it? I never look at our Iron Virgin.\" \n \n \"There is some difference in value,\" Mrs. Payton reproved her. \n \n \"No, only in cost,\" her daughter said; then saw the color mount into her mother\u0027s face, and gritted her teeth. (\"I needn\u0027t have said that—but it\u0027s true! Darn it, I am like him!\") After that she tried to think of something pleasant to say, but what was there to talk about?—only the waitress, and the heat, and the barber\u0027s dirty children. Indeed, it would have been difficult to decide which found that visit to the bungalow the most trying, the mother or the daughter. Certainly it was a relief to both of them when it was over. \n \n \"Mother came out to the camp and I wasn\u0027t a bit nice to her,\" Fred bemoaned herself, one day, to Arthur Weston, when he met her entering No. 15 just as he was leaving it. He turned back and followed her into the parlor. \n \n \"And nobody can be so un-nice as you, when you put your mind on it,\" he said, genially. \n \n She laughed. \"You never talk through your hat to me; you\u0027re straight. That\u0027s why I like you.\" \n \n \"Then you\u0027ll like me more, for I\u0027m going to be very straight,\" he warned her. He looked about for any kind of a cool seat, but subsided into a linen-covered feather-bed of a chair, close to the bust of Mr. Andrew Payton;[Pg 149] his eye-glasses on their black ribbon dangling in a thread of sunshine, sent faint lights back and forth on the ceiling. \"Life is very dull for your mother,\" he said, fanning himself with his hat; \"why don\u0027t you come in oftener?\" \n \n Frederica, on the piano-stool, struck a careless octave. \"Life dull? Why, I think it\u0027s wildly exciting! As for coming in, I\u0027m too busy.\" \n \n \"Reforming the world? You might begin the reformation by making things happier here. Happiness is a valuable reformatory agent. You could cheer Mrs. Payton up, but you prefer \u0027being busy.\u0027\" \n \n Fred colored. He had spoken to her once before in this same peremptory way, and she had been angry; now she was embarrassed. \"I\u0027m on my job. I\u0027ve started a suffrage league—\" \n \n \"There are other people who can start leagues. There is only one person who can make your mother happy.\" \n \n \"Mr. Weston, the relative value of picture puzzles and the emancipation of women—\" \n \n That made him really indignant; he stopped fanning himself and looked at her with hard eyes. \"The doing of the immediate duty by each individual woman will emancipate the sex a good deal quicker than talking! You needn\u0027t stop your suffrage work to do your duty as a daughter. Did you ever hear anything about bearing one another\u0027s burdens?\" \n \n \"Sounds like the Bible,\" Fred said. \n \n \"It is. I commend the book as a course in sociology.\" \n \n \"But,\" she defended herself, \"I do come home quite[Pg 150] often. I\u0027m going to be here to-night. I\u0027m going to a dinner dance at the Country Club, and I\u0027m coming back here to stay all night.\" \n \n \"Yes, you will come for your own convenience, not your mother\u0027s pleasure. See here, Fred! You once asked me if you were like your father,\"—involuntarily she raised her hand, as if to fend off a blow—\"I had great respect for Mr. Payton in many ways, but he had the selfishness of power. So have you. Whew!\" he ended, rising, \"I believe it\u0027s a hundred in the shade!\" \n \n Fred was silent. \n \n \"I am coming out to Lakeville in a day or two. Got my new car yesterday, and I am burning to display it.\" \n \n Still she was silent. A watering-cart lumbered by and some children squealed in a sudden cold splash. \n \n \"Until now,\" he said, \"I have believed that you were a good sport.\" \n \n \"And now you think I\u0027m not?\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t seem to know what the word Duty means;—which is another way of saying that you don\u0027t play the game.\" \n \n \"If the game is to make things pleasant for Mortimore, and put picture puzzles together, I don\u0027t care to play it,\" she said, cockily. She followed him to the front door and stood there as he went down the steps. But when he reached the gate she darted after him and clapped a frank hand on his shoulder. \"You\u0027re a dead game sport! I don\u0027t know any other man who\u0027d have biffed me right in the face like that.\" \n \n \"I skinned my own knuckles,\" he admitted, with a[Pg 151] droll gesture of rubbing a bruised hand. \"Still, I don\u0027t mind, if it does you good.\" \n \n \"Cheer up! Maybe it will,\" she said, and, laughing, threw a kiss to him and vanished into the house. He laughed, too—then frowned. \"She wouldn\u0027t have kissed her hand to Maitland. I don\u0027t count,\" he thought. As he walked off, hugging the shady side of the street, he added, \"I am a fool!\" \n \n Frederica had not the slightest intention of becoming immediately domestic, but as she went up-stairs to dress she happened to glance down the little corridor in the ell, and there, outside Morty\u0027s door, was poor, faithful Miss Carter. Her one night off a week, when Mrs. Baker, from the livery-stable, took her place, did not suffice to lessen very much the burden of Morty\u0027s perpetual society, and that and the heat had obviously worn upon her. \n \n \"Miss Carter, why don\u0027t you go to the theater?\" Frederica called to her, impulsively. \"I\u0027ll stay with Morty to-night. I suppose we can\u0027t get Mrs. Baker on such short notice?\" \n \n \"No, she can\u0027t come except on her regular night; and you are going to a dance, Miss Freddy,\" the tired woman objected, rather faintly. \n \n \"Nonsense! I don\u0027t care about dancing. Go ahead. Get a ticket for \u0027Heels and Toes.\u0027 It\u0027s corking.\" \n \n Her mother followed her into her room to thank her. \"That\u0027s very sweet of you, Freddy. Not that Morty needs anybody when he once gets to sleep; so far as that goes, I don\u0027t need to go to the expense of having Mrs.[Pg 152] Baker here on Miss Carter\u0027s evenings out; but I like to feel there\u0027s some one near, you know.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s less lonely for you,\" Fred said, with unwonted insight. \n \n \"Yes,\" Mrs. Payton agreed, wistfully. \"She\u0027s somebody to talk to. You needn\u0027t sit in Morty\u0027s room; outside the door will do. And I\u0027ll sit with you.\" \n \n \"I want to read, so I\u0027ll sit inside by the light.\" \n \n \"Well, don\u0027t be nervous. He won\u0027t stir.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m not in the least nervous,\" Fred said; \"I\u0027m only—disgusted.\" \n \n Mrs. Payton\u0027s chin quivered. \"You ought not to speak so about your brother. Remember, even if he isn\u0027t—bright, he\u0027s a man, and the head of the family.\" Fred looked at her with genuine curiosity; how could she say a thing like that! \"Besides,\" Mrs. Payton added, \"Doctor Davis always said his intellect was there; it isn\u0027t his fault that it is veiled.\" \n \n \"No, it isn\u0027t his fault,\" Frederica said, significantly. She took her book into the bare room, which could not be carpeted or curtained because of the poor, destroying hands that sometimes had to be tied for fear they would claw and snatch, even at Miss Carter\u0027s heavy chair or at the table, screwed down to the floor. There was a drop-light over the table, and Frederica turned it on and opened her book; but she did not read much; the snoring breath from the bed disturbed her. Instead, she fell to thinking about Howard Maitland—sometimes she was impatient with herself for thinking of him so constantly! But the warm satisfaction that took possession of her[Pg 153] whenever he came into her mind, was an irresistible temptation. She did not often speculate upon his feeling for her. \"He\u0027s fond of me,\" she told herself, once in a while, contentedly. That some time he would tell her he was fond of her was a matter of course. Just now, she fell to calculating how soon her last letter would reach him. One from him, acknowledging the receipt of some suffrage literature, had come that morning. \"I don\u0027t believe one woman in fifty has your brains,\" he had written. Fred smiled; when he came home in November she would show him those \"brains\"! Apparently, Mr. Arthur Weston did not take much stock in them—\"He prefers the domestic virtues,\" she thought, with a flash of amusement. \"I wonder if I\u0027m domestic enough to suit him, to-night? I suppose he would think it was better to sit with an idiot than to try to move the world along!\" But the next minute she was contrite. \"He can\u0027t help being old. I suppose this is the sort of thing his generation calls \u0027Duty\u0027!\" \n \n She might have reflected further upon the foolishness of the past generation, if just then Mrs. Payton had not come stealthily along the hall. She stood in the doorway, raising a cautioning finger. \n \n \"Oh, you can\u0027t wake him,\" Frederica said, in her natural voice. But Mrs. Payton spoke in a whisper. \n \n \"Freddy, isn\u0027t your cottage damp—so near the lake? There\u0027s no surer way to take cold than—\" \n \n \"Not a bit damp!\" \n \n \"Does Flora make good coffee for you?\" \n \n \"Bully.\" \n \n [Pg 154] \n \n \"I hope she\u0027s more contented. Miss Carter says the whole trouble with Flora is she wants to get married, but she makes herself so cheap the men won\u0027t look at her.\" \n \n Fred frowned. That word \"cheap\" always irritated her. \n \n \"Miss Carter is a good woman,\" Mrs. Payton went on, \"but she\u0027s a little coarse once in a while.\" \n \n \"I suppose Flora wants a home of her own,\" Fred said, yawning; \"when women have no brains they have to marry for homes.\" \n \n \"All women want homes, whether they have brains or not,\" said Mrs. Payton; \"where would they have their babies if they didn\u0027t have homes? Freddy, it must be very lonely for you in Lakeville. Your Uncle William is really shocked about it. He says there are no people of our class there.\" \n \n \"Billy-boy is correct. I had two people of the better class in to supper last night—workers. Mother, one of the things the women\u0027s vote is going to do, besides giving the Floras of the world a chance to be independent of men, is to obliterate class lines.\" \n \n \"Then it will have to obliterate life,\" Mrs. Payton whispered. \"Women need men to take care of them. And as for class, God makes a difference in people. You can\u0027t vote God down.\" \n \n It was so unusual for Mrs. Payton to set her opinion against her daughter\u0027s that Frederica laughed, in spite of herself. Mrs. Payton laughed a little, too; then they both looked at the bed, but the heavy breathing went steadily on. \n \n [Pg 155] \n \n \"Your grandmother thinks,\" Mrs. Payton said, impulsively, \"that you would have more beaux if we lived up on the Hill.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s like her.\" \n \n \"Freddy dear, you know I have to stay here on account of Morty? Not that I\u0027d do more for him than for you—I love you both just the same! But I couldn\u0027t take him up on the Hill.\" \n \n \"\u0027Course you couldn\u0027t! Mother, for the Lord\u0027s sake, don\u0027t listen to Grandmother! She\u0027s one of the type that keeps the world back.\" \n \n \"She doesn\u0027t like change, that\u0027s all,\" Mrs. Payton explained. She came in and sat down at the table. \n \n \"Yes; she doesn\u0027t like change,\" Fred agreed. \"If Nature had listened to Grandmother we\u0027d all be protoplasm still. Probably the grandmother of the first worm that sprouted legs, kicked. No, she couldn\u0027t kick,\" Fred said, chuckling, \"because she didn\u0027t have the legs she despised; she just said, \u0027It isn\u0027t done!\u0027\" \n \n Mrs. Payton looked perfectly blank. \n \n \"I\u0027m going to use that idea in my paper,\" Fred said, with satisfaction. \n \n \"Do you think Howard Maitland likes you to write papers, dear?\" \n \n \"Likes me to? Why shouldn\u0027t he? It wouldn\u0027t make a bit of difference to me whether he did or not, but as he has ordinary garden sense, I am sure he doesn\u0027t dislike it.\" \n \n \"Men,\" Mrs. Payton said, timidly, \"don\u0027t like clever women.\" \n \n [Pg 156] \n \n \"Clever men do.\" \n \n \"Your dear father was clever—but he married me.\" \n \n The simplicity of that was touching, even to Frederica. \n \n \"You were a thousand times too good for him!\" \n \n Mrs. Payton was pleased, but she made the proper protest: \"Oh, my dear! I had a letter from your grandmother yesterday; she thinks it\u0027s shocking—your living in Lakeville alone.\" \n \n \"Go on!\" Frederica said, contemptuously. \n \n \"Hush-sh!\" Mrs. Payton cautioned her. \n \n Fred shrugged her shoulders. \"You can\u0027t wake—That. Talk about being shocked,—I suppose it never occurred to Uncle William or Grandmother that their ideas of what is and isn\u0027t shocking, produced That?\" \n \n Mrs. Payton shrunk away as if her daughter had struck her; she murmured, chokingly, some wounded remonstrance, then tiptoed through the shadowy hall into the sitting-room. At the table, spread with an unfinished game of Canfield, she sat down, drearily. This was what always happened; they simply could not get along together! Whenever she held out empty hands, begging for love, they were slapped. She began to shuffle the cards, wondering painfully if it was because Freddy was still brooding over that thing she said about loving Mortimore best. \"I\u0027m afraid she\u0027s jealous,\" Mrs. Payton sighed. \n \n Frederica, alone, reflected upon her mother\u0027s assertion that men disliked clever women. It annoyed her, not because there was any truth in it, but because it reminded her of Woman\u0027s cowardly acquiescence in Man\u0027s estimate of her intelligence. Of course it was all right about[Pg 157] Howard; Howard had sense! But men generally—did they really dislike clever women? If so, it merely meant that they were afraid of Truth. They wanted women to be timid, and pretty, and useless: to be slaves and playthings!—so they fooled them into the belief that silliness was attractive, and that slavery and virtue were the same thing. It was men who had taught women to believe that awful thing her mother had said about Morty\u0027s being \"the head of the family\"; had taught them to believe that a man—not because he was good, or wise, or strong, but because he was a man—was the one to rule! \n \n \"No wonder we are slaves; we\u0027ve swallowed that lie since Adam. Well, there\u0027ll be none of it in mine!\" she said. What was going to be in \"hers\"? Business, to begin with. She was going to make a success of her business. Her books had shown a better month—they should show a still better month, if she wore her shoes out walking about town to please clients! Yes, Success! It was not a personal ambition: there was no self-seeking in Fred Payton; she wanted to succeed because her success would show what women could do; show that a woman was as able as a man—as wise, as good (\"better! better!\" she told herself); show that a woman could rule, could achieve, could be \"the head of the family\"! The thing that was to be \"in hers\" was work to free women from the shackles of the old ideals, from content in sex slavery, with all its ignorances and futilities, its slackness of purpose and shameful timidities, that a man-made world had called \"duties.\" And Howard, who was not \"afraid of clever women,\" would help her! A passion of consecration to[Pg 158] the woman\u0027s cause rose in her heart like a wave. For the next hour she walked up and down the dimly lighted room, planning what she was going to do for women. \n \n It was nearly twelve when Miss Carter\u0027s ponderous step told her she was free. She laughed good-naturedly at the thanks the refreshed woman was eager to give, but just as she was leaving the room Miss Carter\u0027s last word caught her ear: \n \n \"I\u0027ve had such a pleasant time, Miss Freddy. I\u0027ll do my work better for it.\" \n \n \u0027Do her work better.\u0027... In her eagerness to do her own work Fred had never thought very much of other people\u0027s; but what a different world it would be if everybody did their work better! \"If every woman did her best on her job, even if it were only taking care of Mortimores, it would help things along,\" she told herself. \"It\u0027s slackness on the job that holds the world back.\" Looked at from that angle, then—the bettering of Miss Carter\u0027s work—perhaps it did count to make things pleasant at Payton Street? The idea put a new light on Mr. Weston\u0027s call-down. Bearing other people\u0027s burdens had seemed not in the least worth while; but if cheering people up helped them to do their work—work which, after all, had to be done, somehow!—why, then there was sense in it. She saw no sense in \"cheering\" her mother, for her mother did nothing at all. Frederica had no dutiful illusions; Mrs. Payton was an absolutely useless human being—and her daughter was perfectly aware of it. \"She has no burden to bear,\" Fred thought, carelessly. \"But to give old fat Carter a hand by just amusing her,—that[Pg 159] helps the doing of work; and that counts! I\u0027ll come in oftener,\" she decided. \n \n So, in her own fashion, by a back door, so to speak, Frederica Payton entered into the old idea of Duty. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1821/52862.html","bookId":1026,"book":{"id":1026,"title":"The Rising Tide","description":"简介： A single car-track ran through Payton Street, and over it, once in a while, a small car jogged along, drawn by two mules.
