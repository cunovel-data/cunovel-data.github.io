{"id":36701,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII","content":"Mr. Weston, riding home in the taxi, was not without some astonishment at himself. Why was he so keenly annoyed at Fred\u0027s bad taste? Why had he such an ardent desire to kick Maitland? He might have gone further in his self-analysis and discovered that, though he wanted to kick Howard, he did not want to haul him over the coals, as a man of his years might well have done—merely to give a friendly tip as to propriety to a youngster whom he had seen put into breeches. Had he discovered this reluctance in himself, Arthur Weston might have decided that his indignation was based on a sense of personal injury—which has its own significance in a man of nearly fifty who concerns himself in the affairs of a woman under thirty. The fact was that, though he thought of himself only as her grandfatherly trustee, Frederica Payton was every day taking a larger place in his life. She amused him, and provoked him, and interested him; but, most of all, the pain of her passionate futilities roused him to a pity that made him really suffer. He could not bear to see pain. Briefly, she gave him something to think about. His displeasure evaporated overnight, and when he went up to her office the next morning he was ready to[Pg 91] apologize for his words in the taxi. But it was not necessary. Fred, in the excitement of receiving a letter asking her fee for hunting up rooms, had quite forgotten that she had been scolded. \"I think I\u0027d better advertise in all the daily papers!\" she announced, eagerly. \"You\u0027re a good fellow,\" he said; \"you take your medicine and don\u0027t make faces.\" \"Make faces? Oh, you mean because you called me down last night? Bless you, if it amuses you, it doesn\u0027t hurt me!\" The sense of her youth came over him in a pang of loneliness, and with it, curiously enough, an impulse of flight, which made him say, abruptly: \"I shall probably go abroad in January. Can I trust you not to advertise yourself into bankruptcy before I get back?\" \"Oh, Mr. Weston,\" she said, blankly; \"how awful! Don\u0027t go!\" \"You don\u0027t need me,\" he assured her; but a faint pleasure stirred about his heart. \"Need you? Why, I simply couldn\u0027t live without you! In the first place, my business would go to pot, without your advice; and then—well, you know how it is. You are the only person who speaks my language. Grandmother talks about my vulgarities, and Aunt Bessie talks about my stomach, and the Childs cousins talk about my vices—but nobody talks about my interests, except you. Don\u0027t go and leave me,\" she pleaded with him. The glow of pleasure about his heart warmed into actual happiness. \"Please don\u0027t think I approve of you!\" [Pg 92] She looked at him with her gray, direct eyes, and nodded. \"I know you don\u0027t. But I don\u0027t mind;—you understand.\" \"But,\" he said, raising a rueful eyebrow, \"how shall I make Cousin Mary \u0027understand\u0027 your performances?\" \"By staying at home and keeping me in order! Don\u0027t go away.\" It was the everlasting feminine: \"I need you!\" There was no \"new woman\" in it; no self-sufficiency; nothing but the old, dependent arrogance that has charmed and held the man by its flattering selfishness ever since the world began. He was opening the office door, but she laid a frankly anxious hand on his arm. \"Promise me you won\u0027t go!\" He would not commit himself. \"It depends; if you get married, and shut up shop, you won\u0027t want a business adviser.\" \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t get married!\" she said, and blushed to her temples. Mr. Weston saw the color, and his face, as he closed her door and stood waiting for the elevator, dulled a little. \"She\u0027s head over ears in love with him. Well, he\u0027s a very decent chap; it\u0027s an excellent match for her,—Oh,\" he apologized to the elevator boy, on suddenly finding himself on the street floor; \"I forgot to get off! You\u0027ll have to take me up again.\" In his own office he was distinctly curt. \"I am very busy,\" he said, checking his stenographer\u0027s languid remark about a telephone call; \"I am going to write letters. Don\u0027t let any one interrupt me\"—and the door of his private office closed in her face. [Pg 93] \"What\u0027s the matter with him?\" the young lady asked herself, idly; then took out her vanity glass and adjusted her marcel wave. Arthur Weston put his feet on his desk, and reflected. Why had he said what he did about going to Europe? When he went up to see Fred, nothing had been farther from his mind than leaving America. Well, he knew why he had said it.... Flight! Self-preservation! \"Preposterous,\" he said, \"what am I thinking of? I\u0027m fond of her, and I\u0027m confoundedly sorry for her, but that\u0027s all. Anyhow, Maitland settles the question. And if he wasn\u0027t in it—she\u0027s twenty-five and I\u0027m forty-six.\" He got up and walked aimlessly about the room. \"I\u0027ve cut my wisdom teeth,\" he thought, with a dry laugh, and wondered where the lady was who had superintended that teething. For Kate\u0027s sake he had taken a broken heart to Europe. The remembrance of that heartbreak reassured him; the feeling he had about Fred wasn\u0027t in the least like his misery of that time. He gave a shrug of relief; it occurred to him that he would go and see some Chinese rugs which had been advertised in the morning paper; \"might give her one for a wedding present?—oh, the devil! Haven\u0027t I anything else to think of than that girl?\" He stood at the window for a long time, his hands in his pockets, looking at three pigeons strutting and balancing on a cornice of the Chamber of Commerce. \"She interests me,\" he conceded; then he smiled,—\"and she wants me to stay at home and \u0027take care of her\u0027!\" Well, there was nothing he would like better than to take care of Fred. The first thing he would do would be to[Pg 94] shut up that ridiculous plaything of an \"office\" on the tenth floor. Billy Childs put it just right: \"perfec\u0027 nonsense!\" Then, having removed \"F. Payton\" from the index of the Sturtevant Building, they—he and Fred—would go off, to Europe. He followed this vagrant thought for a moment, then reddened with impatience at his own folly: \"What an idiot I am! I\u0027m not the least in love with her, but I\u0027ll miss her like the devil when she marries that cub Maitland. She\u0027s a perpetual cocktail! She\u0027d be as mad as a hornet if she knew that I never took her seriously.\" He laughed, and found himself wishing that he could take her in his arms, and tease her, and scold her, and make her \"mad as a hornet.\" Again the color burned in his cheeks; he would do something else than tease her and scold her; he would most certainly kiss her. \"Oh, confound it!\" he said to himself, angrily; \"I\u0027m getting stale.\" He did not want to kiss her! He only wanted to make her happy, and be himself amused. \"That is the difference between now and ten years ago,\" he analyzed. \"Kate never \u0027amused\u0027 me; oh, how deadly serious it all was!\" He speculated about Kate quite comfortably. She was married; very likely she had half a dozen brats. Again he contrasted his feeling for Fred with that brief madness of pain, and was cheered; it was so obvious that he was merely fond of her. How could he help it—she was so honest, so unselfconscious! Besides, she was pathetic. Her harangues upon subjects of which she was (like most of mankind) profoundly ignorant, were funny, but they were touching, too, for her complacent certainties would so inevitably bring her into bruising[Pg 95] contact with Life. \"She thinks \u0027suffrage\u0027 a cure-all,\" he thought, amused and pitiful,—\"and she\u0027s so desperately young!\" In her efforts to reform the world, she was like some small creature buffeting the air. In fact, all this row that women were making was like beating the air. \"What\u0027s it about, anyhow?\" he thought. \"What on earth do they want—the women?\" It seemed to him, looking a little resentfully at the ease and release from certain kinds of toil that had come to women in the last two or three decades, that they had everything that reasonable creatures could possibly want. \"Think how their grandmothers had to work!\" he said to himself. \"Now, all that these ridiculous creatures have to do is to touch a button—and men\u0027s brains do the rest.\" Certainly there is an enormous difference in the collective ease of existence; women don\u0027t have to make their candles, or knit their stockings, as their grandmothers did:—\"yet, nowadays, they are making more fuss than all the women that ever lived, put together! What\u0027s the matter with \u0027em?\" He grew quite hot over the ingratitude of the sex. His old Scotch housekeeper, reading her Bible, and sewing from morning to night, was far happier than these restless, dissatisfied creatures, who, in the upper classes, flooded into schools of design and conservatories of music—not one in a hundred with talent enough to cover a five-cent piece!—and in the lower classes pulled down wages in factories and shops. \"Amateur Man,\" he said, sarcastically. \"Suppose we tried to do their jobs?\" Then he paused to think what Fred\u0027s job, for instance, would be. Not discovering it offhand, he told himself again that if[Pg 96] women would keep busy, like their grandmothers—his contemptuous thought stopped, with a jerk; how could women do the things their grandmothers did? What was it Fred had got off—something about machinery being the cuckoo which had pushed women out of the nest of domesticity? \"Why,\" he was surprised into saying, \"she\u0027s right!\" He came upon the deduction so abruptly that for a moment he forgot his sore feeling about Frederica\u0027s youth. Suppose the women should suddenly take it into their heads to be domestic, and flock out of the mechanical industries, back to the \"Home\"? Arthur Weston whistled. \"Financially,\" said he, candidly, \"we would bu\u0027st in about ten minutes.\"... \"Do you want to give me those prices to Laughlin before I go out to lunch?\" a flat voice asked in the outer office; he slid into his desk-chair as the door opened. \"I haven\u0027t had time to look them up yet. Don\u0027t wait.\" He took up his pen, but only made aimless marks on his blotting-paper; the interruption jarred him back into irritated denial of possibilities: \"She amuses me, that\u0027s all; I\u0027m not in the least—in love.\" Suddenly, with a spring of resolution, he took down the telephone receiver and called up a number. The conversation was brief: \"Hello! Jim?... Yes; I\u0027m Arthur. Look here, I want to break away for a week.... Yes—break away. B-r-e-a-k. I\u0027m stale. Can\u0027t you go down to the marshes with me, for ducks?... What? Oh, come on! You\u0027re not as important as you think.... What?... I\u0027ll do the work—you just come along!\" [Pg 97] There followed a colloquy of some urgency on his part, and then a final, satisfied \"Good boy! Wednesday, then, on the seven-thirty.\" He had hardly secured his man before he regretted it; the mere prospect of the arrangements he must make for the trip began to bore him. However, he sat there at his desk and made some memoranda, conscious all the time of a nagging self-questioning in the back of his mind. \"I\u0027m not!\" he said, again and again. \"I\u0027ll get some shooting and clear my brain up.\" But by the time he had sent a despatch or two, and called Jim Jackson up a second time to decide some detail, he knew that shooting would not help him much. The nag had settled itself: he had accepted the revelation that he was \"interested\" in Freddy Payton. With the contrast between the pain of the old wound and the new, he would not use the word \"love,\" but \"interest\" committed him to an affection, tender almost to poignancy. Of course there was nothing to do about it. He must just take his medicine, as Fred took hers, \"without making faces.\" There was nothing to strive for, nothing to avoid, nothing to expect. She was as good as engaged to Howard Maitland, and it would be a very sensible and desirable match;—to marry a man of forty-six would be neither sensible nor desirable! No; the only thing left to her trustee was to take every care of her that her eccentricities would permit, guard her, play with her, and correct her appalling taste. \"Lord! what bad taste she has!\" Also, while he and Jackson were wading about on the marshes for the next week, kick some sense into himself! [Pg 98] That very evening, dropping in to the Misses Graham\u0027s and partaking of a bleakly feminine meal, he laid his lance in rest for her. Miss Mary was full of flurried apologies at the meagerness of the supper-table, but old Miss Eliza said, with spirit, that bread and milk would be good for him! \"Now, tell us about that child, Arthur,\" she commanded. \"You mean Fred Payton, I suppose?\" he said, raising an annoyed eyebrow. \"I don\u0027t call her a \u0027child.\u0027\" \"You are quite right,\" Miss Mary agreed, in her little neutral voice; \"she is certainly old enough to know how to behave herself.\" \"It\u0027s merely that she wants to reform the world,\" Miss Eliza said, soothingly. \"Reformers have no humor, and, of course, no taste;—or else they wouldn\u0027t be reformers!\" \"Your dear cousin Eliza is too kind-hearted,\" Miss Mary said; but her own kind, if conventional, heart made her listen sympathetically enough to the visitor\u0027s excusing recital of the hardships of Fred\u0027s life. Once, she interrupted him by saying that it was, of course, painful—the afflicted brother. And once she said she hoped that Miss Payton was a comfort to her mother—\"though I don\u0027t see how she can be, off every day at what she calls her \u0027office\u0027—a word only to be applied, it seems to me, to places where gentlemen conduct their business. When I was young, Arthur, a girl\u0027s first duty was in her home.\" \"Perhaps there is nothing for her to do at home,\" Miss Eliza said. [Pg 99] \"There is always something to do, in every properly conducted household. Let her dust the china-closet.\" \"I\u0027d as soon put a tornado into a china-closet as that girl! She ought to be turning a windmill,\" Miss Eliza said. Her cousin gave her a grateful look, but the other lady was very serious. \"I thought her manner to her grandmother most unpleasant. Youth should respect Age—\" \"Not unless Age deserves respect!\" cried Miss Eliza, tossing her old head. Arthur Weston had seen that same flash in Fred\u0027s eyes. (\"How young she is!\" he thought.) But her sister was plainly shocked. \"Oh, my dear Eliza!\" she expostulated. \"I am not drawn to Mrs. Holmes myself, but—\" \"Neither is Fred drawn to her,\" Weston interrupted; \"and she is so sincere that she shows her feelings. The rest of us don\u0027t. That\u0027s the only difference.\" \"It is a very large difference,\" Miss Graham said; \"this matter of showing one\u0027s feelings is as apt to mean cruelty as sincerity. It\u0027s the reason the child has no charm.\" \"I think she has charm,\" he said, frowning. There was a startled silence; then Miss Eliza said, heartily: \"Don\u0027t worry about her! Just now she thinks it\u0027s smart to put her thumb to her nose and twiddle her fingers at Life—but she\u0027ll settle down and be a dear child!\" Miss Mary shook her head. \"If I were a friend of the young lady, I should worry very much. Maria Spencer called on us yesterday, and told us a most unpleasant[Pg 100] story about her. She spent the night at an inn with this same young man that she smoked with here. Oh, an accident, of course; but—\" \"Miss Spencer is the town scavenger,\" Weston said, angrily. Miss Mary did not notice the interruption. \"I cannot help remarking that I do not think that such a young woman would make any man happy.\" (\"It was difficult to bring the remark in,\" she told her sister, afterward; \"but I felt it my duty.\") \"The man who gets Fred will be a lucky fellow,\" her cousin declared. \"You know her very well, I infer,\" Miss Mary murmured. \"I observe you use her first name.\" \"Oh, very well! And I knew her father before her. But the use of the first name is one of the new customs. Everybody calls everybody else by their first name. Queer custom.\" \"Very queer,\" said Miss Mary. \"Very sensible!\" said Miss Eliza. \"Ah, well, we must just accept the fact that girls are not brought up as they were when—when we were young\"—Arthur Weston paused, but no one corrected that \"we.\" He sighed, and went on: \"The tide of new ideas is sweeping away a lot of the old landmarks; myself, I think it is better for some of them to go. For instance, the freedom nowadays in the relations of boys and girls makes for a straightforwardness that is rather fine.\" \"Well,\" said Miss Mary, \"I don\u0027t like what you call \u0027new ideas.\u0027 \u0027New\u0027 things shock me very much.\" [Pg 101] \"I\u0027m rather shocked, myself, once in a while,\" he agreed, good-naturedly. \"What will you do, Mary, when the \u0027new\u0027 heaven and the \u0027new\u0027 earth come along?\" Miss Eliza demanded. The younger sister lifted disapproving hands. \"As for the girls smoking,\" Weston said, \"I don\u0027t like it any better than you do. In fact, I dislike it. But my dislike is ?sthetic, not ethical.\" \"I hope you don\u0027t think smoking is a sign of the \u0027new\u0027 heaven,\" Miss Mary said;—but her sister\u0027s aside—\"the Other Place, more likely!\"—disconcerted her so much that for a moment she was silenced. \"I never could see,\" said Miss Eliza, \"that it was any wickeder for a lady to smoke than for a gentleman; but, as I told the child, a girl\u0027s lips ought to be sweet.\" \"Her smoking is far less serious than other things,\" said the younger sister, sitting up very straight and rigid. \"I do not wish to believe ill of the girl, so I shall only repeat that I do not think she will make any man happy.\" \"She will,\" Miss Eliza said, \"if he will beat her.\" \"Oh, my dear Eliza!\" Miss Mary remonstrated. Then she tried to be charitable: \"However, perhaps she is engaged to this Maitland person, in which case, though her taste would be just as bad, her meeting him here would be less shocking.\" \"If she isn\u0027t now, she will be very soon,\" Frederica\u0027s defender said. \"Well,\" said Miss Mary, grimly, \"let us hope so, for her sake; although, as I say, I do not feel that she—\" Miss Eliza looked at her cousin, and winked; he choked[Pg 102] with laughter. Then, with the purpose of saving Freddy, he began to dissect Freddy\u0027s grandmother—her powder and false hair; her white veil, her dog-collar—\"that\u0027s to keep her double chin up,\" he said. \"Yes! She is very lively for her age!\" He wished he could say that old Mrs. Holmes was in the habit of meeting gentlemen in empty apartments—anything to draw attention from his poor Fred! When he left his cousins, promising to come again as soon as he got back from his shooting trip, and declaring that he hadn\u0027t had such milk toast in years, he knew that he had not rehabilitated Frederica. \"But Cousin Mary feels that she has done her duty in warning me. Cousin Eliza would gamble on it, and give her to me to-morrow,\" he thought; \"game old soul! But even if Howard wasn\u0027t ahead of the game, the odds would be against me—forty-six to twenty-five—and, besides, what could I offer her? Ashes! Kate trampled out the fire.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1821/52857.html","bookId":1026,"book":{"id":1026,"title":"The Rising Tide","description":"简介： A single car-track ran through Payton Street, and over it, once in a while, a small car jogged along, drawn by two mules.
