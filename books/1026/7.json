{"id":36700,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII","content":"At the jar of the banging door, Andy Payton\u0027s hat moved slightly on the hat-rack, and something snarled at the head of the stairs. \"It\u0027s nothing, Morty—only sister,\" a motherly voice said; and Miss Carter leaned over the baluster: \"I\u0027m just bringing him down to his supper; he\u0027s a little nervous this evening.\" \"Oh,\" Fred said, shortly; \"well, wait till I get out of the way, please.\" She stepped into the unlighted parlor, and stood there in the darkness, between the piano and the bust of Mr. Andrew Payton; as she waited, her hand fell on the open keyboard, and she struck a jangling chord. \"Flora has been playing on the sly,\" she thought; \"poor old Flora!\" Then for a moment her fingers were rigid on the keys—the scrabbling procession was passing through the hall down to the room where Mortimore\u0027s food was given to him. When the door closed behind him she drew a breath of relief. She never looked at her brother when she could avoid it. As she went up-stairs she paused on the landing to call out, \"Hello, Mother!\" Mrs. Payton answered from the sitting-room: \"Don\u0027t you want some tea, dear?\" [Pg 83] Frederica hesitated; she didn\u0027t want any tea, but—\"I suppose it pleases her,\" she thought, resignedly; and went into the pleasant, fire-lit room, with its bubbling teakettle and fragrance of Roman hyacinths blooming on the window-sills. \"Finished your puzzle?\" she asked, good-naturedly. Mrs. Payton, grateful for a little interest, said: \"No; I\u0027ve been doing up Christmas presents most of the afternoon. I\u0027m pretty tired! Tying all those ribbons is dreadfully hard work,\" she ended, with an air of achievement that was pathetic or ridiculous, as one might happen to look at it. Her daughter, glancing at the array of white packages tied with gay ribbons, did not see the pathos. That slightly supercilious droop of the lip which always made Mrs. Payton draw back into herself, showed Fred\u0027s opinion of the \"hard work\"; but she only said, laconically: \"Mr. Weston took me to call on the old maids. No, I don\u0027t want any tea, thank you.\" \"You oughtn\u0027t to call them \u0027old maids\u0027; it isn\u0027t respectful.\" \"It\u0027s what they are—at least, the younger one is. The other one is very nice. But they are both of \u0027em of the vintage of 1830.\" Mrs. Payton was sufficiently acquainted with her daughter\u0027s picturesque, but limited, vocabulary to know what \"vintage\" meant, so she said: \"Oh, no; they are not so old as that. I don\u0027t think Miss Graham is much over seventy.\" \"I waked Miss Mary up!\" Frederica said, joyfully. [Pg 84] \"I am sorry for that,\" Mrs. Payton sighed. Fred shrugged her shoulders. \"Grandmother will tattle,—yes, she was there; deaf as a post, and all dolled up like a plush horse;—so I suppose I might as well tell you just what happened.\" She told it, lightly enough. \"Old Weston threw fits in the taxi, coming home,\" she ended. \"I should think he might! Freddy, really—\" Her daughter looked at her with narrowing but not unkind eyes. \"I wish I knew why people fuss so over nothing,\" she said. Mrs. Payton put her empty cup back on the tray with a despairing sigh: \"If you can\u0027t see the impropriety—\" \"Oh, of course, I see what you call \u0027impropriety\u0027; what I don\u0027t see is why you call it \u0027improper.\u0027 What constitutes impropriety? The fact that, as Grandmother says, \u0027it isn\u0027t done\u0027? I could mention a lot of things that are done, that I would call improper! Wearing nasty false fronts, as Grandmother does, and silly tight shoes. A thing is true, or it\u0027s a lie. That distinction is worth while. But what you call \u0027impropriety\u0027 isn\u0027t worth bothering about.\" \"Truth and falsehood are not the only distinctions in the world. Things are fitting, or—not.\" \"Howard and I talked, in an empty flat,\" Fred said; \"I suppose if it had been in our parlor, with the Egyptian virgin out in the hall chaperoning us, it would have been \u0027fitting\u0027?\" Mrs. Payton wiped her eyes. \"There\u0027s no use discussing anything with you. When I was a young lady, if my mother had reproved—\" [Pg 85] Fred made a discouraged gesture: \"Oh, don\u0027t let\u0027s go back to the dark ages. As for Howard—I\u0027ll see him at my office, if it makes you any happier.\" \"Why can\u0027t he call on you in your own house? You cheapen yourself by—\" \"Mother, there\u0027s no use! I couldn\u0027t stand it. Mortimore—\" \"Frederica!\" Mrs. Payton\u0027s gesture of command was inescapable. Involuntarily Fred\u0027s lips closed; when her mother spoke to her in that tone, the childish habit of obedience asserted itself. But it was only for a moment: \"Of course you don\u0027t mind him,\" she said; \"you are fond of him. But you can\u0027t expect me to feel as you do.\" She drew in her breath with a shiver of disgust. \"I love you both just the same!\" Mrs. Payton said, emphatically. Frederica was not listening. \"Oh, by the way,\" she said, \"I\u0027ve heard of a little bungalow, at that camp place, Lakeville—you know?—that I can rent for twenty-five dollars a month. I\u0027m going to hire it for next summer—rather ahead of time, but somebody might grab it. I want to have a place to go, when I have two or three days off. I hope you\u0027ll come out sometimes. And—and Miss Carter can bring Morty,\" she ended, with generous intention. Mrs. Payton was silent. She was saying to herself, despairingly, \"She\u0027s jealous!\" \"Well, I must go and dress,\" Frederica said, and got herself out of the room, acutely conscious of her mother\u0027s averted face. \"\u0027Cheapening\u0027 myself—how silly!\" she[Pg 86] thought, as she closed her own door. When she took her cigarette-case out of her pocket, Miss Graham\u0027s words came into her mind and she smiled; but she lighted a cigarette and, standing before her mirror, practised knocking off the ashes. Was it this way? Was it that way? How does the \"kid boy\" do it? She tried a dozen ways; but she could not remember the entirely unconscious gesture which had pleased Howard Maitland. \"How funny and old-fashioned old Miss Graham was! But quite sweet,\" she thought. It occurred to her, as she took out her hair-pins, that Miss Graham\u0027s antiquated ideas did not irritate her, and her mother\u0027s did. For a moment she pondered this old puzzle of humanity: \"Why are members of your family more provoking than outsiders?\" After all, Miss Graham, with her \"roses,\" was just as irrational as Mrs. Payton with her fuss about propriety and \"cheapness\"—or Arthur Weston, gassing about \"relations which are not markedly intellectual.\" She was angry at him, but that phrase made her giggle. She sat down on the edge of her bed, her brush in her hand, her hair hanging about her shoulders; it had been very interesting, that \"cheap\" and entirely \"intellectual\" hour alone with Howard in the darkening flat.... She put her elbow on her knee, her chin in her hand, and smiled. Of course she knew what her mother, and Mr. Weston—\"poor old boy!\"—and her grandmother, and the Misses Graham all had in the back of their minds. \"Idiots\" she said, good-naturedly. If they could have heard the plain, straight, man-to-man talk in the empty apartment, they would have discovered that nowadays men and[Pg 87] girls are not interested in those unintellectual relations at which her man of business had hinted. She remembered Howard\u0027s look when he said he would rather talk to her than to any man he knew—and she lifted her head proudly! No girly-girly compliment could have pleased her as that did. It was just as she had always said, the right kind of man knows that a woman wants him to talk horse sense to her, not gush. If the tabbies, and Mr. Weston, and her mother had heard that talk, they wouldn\u0027t worry about sentiment! Suddenly, she recalled that strange feeling she had had below her breastbone as she looked at Howard sprawling in the arm-chair. She remembered her curious impulse to touch him, and the rosy warmth that seemed to go all over her, like a wave; she thought of that pang of pleasure when his hand crushed hers so that the seal ring had cut into the flesh and hurt her. \"I wonder—?\" she said; and bit her lip. Then her face reddened sharply; she flung her head up like a wild creature who feels the grip of the trap. Love? For an instant she felt something like fright. \"Of course not! He\u0027s just a bully fellow, and I like him. Nothing more; I don\u0027t—\" She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, and the image held her eye. The vivid, smiling face, a little thin, with the color hot, just now, on the high cheek-bones; dark, wavy hair, falling back from a charming brow which, pathetically enough (for she was only twenty-five), had lines in it. \"Heavens!\" she said, \"I believe I do!\" She laughed, and, jumping to her feet, shook the mane of hair over her eyes. But before she began to[Pg 88] brush it she lifted the hand Howard Maitland had gripped, and kissed it hard, once—twice! \"I do—care,\" she said; \"I didn\u0027t know it was like this!\" She glowed all over. \"I am in love,\" she repeated, amazed. While she tumbled the soft, dark hair into a loose knot on the top of her head she tried to whistle, but her lips were unsteady. She did not know herself with this quiver all through her, and the sudden stinging in her eyes, and something swelling and tightening in her throat. She forgot the shocked old maids, and the disgusted trustee. She was in love! She began to sing, but broke off at a faint knock. \"Dinner\u0027s ready, Miss Freddy.\" \"Come in, Flora,\" Frederica called out; \"and hook me up.\" She smiled so gaily at the silent creature, not even scolding when the slim, cold finger-tips touched her warm shoulder, that the woman smiled a little, too. \"I thought this was your afternoon out?\" Fred said, kindly. \"I \u0027ain\u0027t got no place in partic\u0027lar to go. Anyway, I knew your ma wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to be in, and—\" \"I bet you played on the piano,\" Frederica said, smiling at herself in the glass. \"Well, yes\u0027m, I did,\" the woman confessed. \"I picked out the whole of \u0027Rock of Ages.\u0027\" \"Flora! Don\u0027t look so low-spirited; I believe you\u0027re in love. Have you got a new beau? I\u0027ve been told that people are always low-spirited when they\u0027re in love.\" Flora simpered; \"Ah, now, Miss Freddy!\" \"Come! Who is he? You\u0027ve got to tell me!\" \"Well, Mr. Baker\u0027s got a new man on. That there snide[Pg 89] Arnold\u0027s been bounced. Good riddance! He never did \u0027mount to nothing. Me, I\u0027m sorry for the girl he married; she\u0027ll just slave and git no wages. That\u0027s what marryin\u0027 Arnold\u0027ll do for her!\" \"That\u0027s what marrying any man does for a woman,\" Miss Payton instructed her; \"a wife is a slave.\" But Flora\u0027s face had softened into abject sentimentality. \"This here new man, Sam, he\u0027s something like. Light, he is; and freckled.\" Then her face fell: \"Anne says he\u0027s got a girl on the Hill. Don\u0027t make no difference to me, anyhow. It\u0027s music I want. If I was young, I\u0027d git an education, and go to one of them conservmatories and learn to play on the piano.\" \"I\u0027ll give you some lessons, one of these days,\" Fred promised her, good-naturedly. \"Poor old Flora,\" she said to herself, as the maid, like a fragile brown shadow, slipped out of the room. \"\u0027He\u0027s got a girl on the Hill\u0027! I wonder how I\u0027d feel if Howard had \u0027a girl on the Hill\u0027?\" Again the tremor ran through her; she could not have said whether it was pain or bliss. \"I certainly must teach Flora her notes,\" she said, trying to get back to the commonplace. Then she forgot Flora, and, bending forward, looked at herself in the glass for a long moment. \"I\u0027ll get that hat at Louise\u0027s,\" she said, turning out the gas; \"it\u0027s the smartest thing I\u0027ve struck in many moons.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1821/52856.html","bookId":1026,"book":{"id":1026,"title":"The Rising Tide","description":"简介： A single car-track ran through Payton Street, and over it, once in a while, a small car jogged along, drawn by two mules.
