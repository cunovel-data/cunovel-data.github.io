{"id":36708,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV","content":"Except for the Lakeville ladies, so looked down upon by Flora, Fred had very few visitors that summer. Even Laura did not come very often, though Lakeville was only five miles from Laketon. Perhaps she was afraid of being asked questions. In September both girls were invited by a school friend to come to the seashore for two or three weeks, but Laura waited to know that Fred had declined the invitation (\"I can\u0027t fool with Society. I\u0027m on my job!\" said Fred) before she, Laura, accepted it. \n \n There was, however, one formal call which gave Frederica great joy; her grandmother and Miss Eliza Graham came over from the Laurels to see her—and she never behaved more outrageously! She told Mr. Weston afterward that she had had the time of her life joshing Mrs. Holmes. He assured her that she was an imp, but that he would gladly have paid the price of admission if he had only known that the circus was going to take place. He asked his cousin about it afterward, but her description of the scene was not so funny as Fred\u0027s. Indeed, it was rather pathetic—poor Freddy, fighting her grandmother, while Miss Eliza stood outside the ring, so to speak, and watched, pityingly. \n \n \"For there\u0027s nothing one can do for her, Arthur,\" Miss[Pg 173] Eliza told him; \"she\u0027s got to get some very hard knocks before she\u0027ll give up advising the Creator how to manage His world.\" \n \n She and Mr. Weston had found a deserted spot on the veranda at the Laurels, and she told him what she thought of Freddy. \"It\u0027s a sort of violent righteousness that possesses the child,\" she said. \"Where does she come from, Arthur? That mother! That grandmother! She must be a foundling.\" \n \n \"Her father had power. His righteousness was not very violent, but his temper was.\" \n \n \"She must make her mother very unhappy.\" \n \n \"Yeast makes dough uncomfortable, I suppose,\" he admitted. \n \n \"She\u0027s an unscrupulous truth-teller,\" Miss Graham said, and repeated some of the impertinently accurate things that Frederica, sitting in her ugly little living-room, with the Japanese fans on the walls, and yellow \"Votes for Women\" pennons over the doors, had flung at Mrs. Holmes. \"Her grandmother said the \u0027women of to-day cheapened themselves\u0027; to which she replied that \u0027the women of yesterday were dear at any price\u0027!\" \n \n \"She told me she had merely been truthful,\" Mr. Weston said. \"Justifying herself on the ground of Truth is Fred\u0027s form of repentance. But the girl suffers, Cousin Eliza!\" \n \n \"She\u0027ll have to suffer a good deal before she\u0027ll amount to anything,\" Miss Eliza said, dryly; \"I wanted to shake her! Arthur, if you had any missionary spirit, you would marry her.\" \n \n [Pg 174] \n \n \"But Cousin Mary says she is \u0027not a young woman who is calculated\u0027—\" \n \n They both laughed. \"Nonsense! If she gets a master, she\u0027ll make him happy. A good-natured boy won\u0027t do. The gray mare would be the better horse. Marry her and beat her.\" \n \n \"Maitland will have to do the beating,\" he said. But he could not evade her. \n \n \"Don\u0027t be a fool. Take her! I know you want her.\" \n \n \"I do,\" he confessed. \"But the little matter of her not wanting me seems to be an obstacle.\" \n \n Miss Eliza, her old eagle head silhouetted against the dazzle of the lake, meditated; then she said, \"Is she engaged to Mr. Maitland?\" \n \n \"No, but she\u0027s going to be. Besides, dear lady, I am forty-seven and she is twenty-six. Youth calls to Youth! Please don\u0027t suggest that she might prefer to be an \u0027old man\u0027s darling.\u0027\" \n \n \"You\u0027re not an old man. But the average young man—if he fell in love with her—would be under her thumb.\" \n \n \"Why do you say \u0027if\u0027? Maitland has fallen in love with her, head over heels! He can\u0027t stop talking about her brains for five minutes at a time!\" \n \n Miss Eliza gave him a keen look. \"Well, perhaps human nature has changed since my time. Then, a boy didn\u0027t fall in love with a girl\u0027s brains, though a grown man sometimes did. Cleverness in a girl is like playfulness in a kitten; it amuses a middle-aged man. The next thing he knows, he\u0027s in love!\" \n \n \"Amuses!\" Arthur Weston broke in, cynically; \"to[Pg 175] \u0027amuse\u0027 a middle-aged man doesn\u0027t seem a very satisfying occupation for a girl. Don\u0027t you think she\u0027d rather have a boy\u0027s ridiculously solemn devotion?\" \n \n \"But don\u0027t I tell you?—Love comes next! And I know you are in love, because you are so foolish. Arthur, I\u0027m ashamed of you! Do have some spunk. Get her! Get her! I don\u0027t believe she\u0027s in love with that boy.\" \n \n He gave a rather hopeless laugh. \"Oh, yes, she is. I haven\u0027t the ghost of a chance; besides—\" he paused, took off his glasses, and put them on again, with deliberation—\"besides, if I had a chance, I\u0027d be a cur to take it. As you know, I had a blow below the belt. A man never quite gets his wind again, after a little affair like mine. It would be great luck for me to have Fred, but what sort of luck would it be for her to spend her life \u0027amusing\u0027 me?\" \n \n \"Nonsense! I won\u0027t listen to such—\" she paused, while three girls, romping along, arm in arm, swept past them, down the veranda. \"Pretty things, aren\u0027t they?\" she said, looking after them with tender old eyes; \"how lovely Youth is!—even when it does its best to be ugly as to clothes and manners, like two of those youngsters. They didn\u0027t even see us, they were so absorbed in being young, bless their hearts! The outside one who bowed is a Wharton girl. She is a charming child, charming! And doing wonderfully at college. But those others—!\" \n \n \"Awful,\" he agreed. \"Cousin Eliza, what\u0027s the matter with women, nowadays?\" \n \n \"Perfectly simple. They are drunk!\" \n \n \"Drunk?\" \n \n \"With the sudden sense of freedom. My dear boy,[Pg 176] reflect: When you were born—no, you\u0027re too young\"—he waved a deprecating hand, but he liked the phrase—\"when I was born—that\u0027s seventy-three years ago—women were dependent upon your delightful sex; so, of course, they were cowards and you were bullies. Oh, yes; there were exceptions! There were courageous women, and henpecked men. And, of course, cowardice didn\u0027t always know it was cowardly, and bullying was often nothing but kindness. But you can say what you please, women were not free! They had to do what their men wanted—or quarrel with their families, and strike out for themselves! And what was there for them to do to earn their living? Outside of domestic service, nothing but teaching, sewing, and Sairey Gamp nursing! When I was a girl I did not know enough to teach and I hated sewing. So, if I had wanted to do anything my father and mother didn\u0027t approve of, I couldn\u0027t have kicked up my heels and said, \u0027I\u0027ll support myself!\u0027 Besides, I shouldn\u0027t have dared. The Fifth Commandment was still in existence when I was young. But now,\" she ended, \"that\u0027s all changed. Girls can kick up their heels whenever they feel like it!\" \n \n He laughed, and said that Fred Payton had kicked entirely over the traces. \n \n \"She\u0027s not the only one,\" Miss Graham said; \"those three girls who passed us have done it. That nice Wharton child is going to study law, if you please! Yes, Freedom! It\u0027s gone to their heads; it\u0027s champagne on empty stomachs. Empty only for the last two generations—before that there were endless occupations to fill our stomachs.[Pg 177] (My metaphors are a little mixed!) When I was a girl, the daughters of a house, even when people were as well off as Father, always had things to do—\u0027Duties,\u0027 we called them. But nowadays there\u0027s not enough housework to go round; so if girls are rich, they play at work in—in anything, just to kill time! Like your Miss Freddy.\" \n \n \"Fred is making a success of her real-estate business,\" he said; \"I hadn\u0027t a particle of faith in it, but she\u0027s making it go.\" \n \n \"It doesn\u0027t matter whether you have faith or not; the change has come: she had to have something to do! That\u0027s the secret of the situation, and there\u0027s no use kicking against it. You men have just got to accept the fact of the change. All you can do is to fall back on the thing that hasn\u0027t changed, and never can change, and never will change. Give girls that and they will get sober!\" \n \n He looked puzzled. \n \n \"My dear boy, let them be women, be wives, be mothers! Then being suffragists, or real-estate agents, or anything else, won\u0027t do them the slightest harm. Marry them, Arthur, marry them!\" \n \n \"All of them?\" he protested, in alarm. \n \n She laughed, but held her own. \"I always tell Mary that all that nice, bad child, your Freddy Payton, needs, is a husband. Which Mary thinks is very indelicate in me. But it\u0027s true. As for suffrage that the women are all cackling about, I don\u0027t care a—a—\" \n \n \"Damn?\" he suggested. \n \n \"Copper,\" she reproved him. \"I don\u0027t care a copper about it! I\u0027ve always called myself an anti, but I never[Pg 178] really gave it much thought, one way or the other, until I went to an anti-suffrage meeting last year; that made me a suffragist! I declare, the foolishness of some of their arguments against voting went a long ways toward proving that perhaps they really haven\u0027t the brains to vote! Somebody said—Bessie Childs, I believe it was—that the ballot would take woman out of the Home. I reflected that Bridge took Bessie out of her home, for three or four hours once a week, and voting would take her out for three or four minutes, once a year. But I kept quiet until somebody intimated that the \u0027hand that rocks the cradle\u0027 is not competent, if you please, to deposit a ballot! Then I stood right up in meeting, and said, \u0027I\u0027m only a poor old maid, but to my way of thinking, if the hand is as incompetent as that, it is far more dangerous to trust a cradle to it than a ballot!\u0027\" \n \n \"What did they say to that?\" \n \n \"They said a cradle was every woman\u0027s first duty. \u0027But it would be most improper in me to have a cradle!\u0027 I said. I know they thought me coarse.\" \n \n \"So you are a suffragist?\" \n \n \"Indeed I\u0027m not! I went to a suffrage meeting, and really, Arthur, I was ashamed of my sex; such violence! such conceit! such shallowness! such impropriety! One of them said that any married woman whose husband did not believe in suffrage should leave him or else have branded on her forehead a word—I cannot repeat to you the word she used. And another of them said that all the antis were \u0027idiotic droolers.\u0027 I thought of my dear sister, and I just couldn\u0027t stand that! I said, \u0027Well, ladies, if[Pg 179] the women who don\u0027t want the vote are idiots, is it wise to thrust it upon them? Will idiots make good voters?\u0027\" \n \n \"You had \u0027em there.\" \n \n \"No; they just said \u0027the vote would educate women.\u0027 And as for women not wanting it—\u0027why, we\u0027ll cram it down their throats,\u0027 one of them said. Nice idea of democracy, wasn\u0027t it? She explained that some slaves hadn\u0027t wanted freedom, but that was no reason for not abolishing slavery! And, of course, she was right. The suffragists have brains, you know, Arthur. Well, as a result of a dose of each party, I\u0027m nothing at all—very much.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re agin\u0027 \u0027em both?\" he suggested. \n \n \"Oh, I still call myself an anti, because the antis are, at least, harmless; but I really don\u0027t care much, one way or the other. No; the thing that troubles me isn\u0027t suffrage or non-suffrage; it\u0027s the fact that somehow women seem to be fighting Nature. That worries me. I know that Nature can be depended upon to spank them into common sense when she gets hold of them, but, unfortunately, men won\u0027t help Nature out. They don\u0027t like girls like Miss Payton—I mean, the young men don\u0027t. They don\u0027t like girls who are cleverer than they are; but no girl is cleverer than you! Do \u0027come out of the West, Lochinvar, come out of the West\u0027!\" \n \n He laughed and shook his head. \"My dear cousin, I am dead in love with you, so don\u0027t try to turn my affections in another direction. Besides, Howard Maitland is coming home the end of November.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1821/52864.html","bookId":1026,"book":{"id":1026,"title":"The Rising Tide","description":"简介： A single car-track ran through Payton Street, and over it, once in a while, a small car jogged along, drawn by two mules.
