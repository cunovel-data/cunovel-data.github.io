The guy with her had been wearing a somber black suit.\\n\\n Funeral, he realized suddenly.\\n\\n He shook his head, stopped in the street. From the corner to his right, a rock band hammered out a Stones tune. From the other corner, he could hear jazz. Somewhere down the street, a blues guitar was belting out an indiscernible tune.\\n\\n He swore softly.\\n\\n New Orleans.\\n\\n Hell, welcome home.\\n\\n Oh, yeah. It was just great to be here.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going off the deep end, Nikki,\" Julian said. \"That was just great. Throwing yourself into a group of drunks. What were you expecting? And don\u0027t even think about giving me a lecture on how no one deserves to be attacked. You went flying into a sludge of inebriated testosterone in its sweet young prime, so what were you expecting?\"\\n\\n \"I saw him!\" she said, finding the catch on the gate and pushing it open herself. Julian\u0027s words made her feel guilty—he was a good friend, and he would have defended her to the death, which, considering the drunken mood of the rowdy gang, just might have been the sad finale if it hadn\u0027t been for their strange savior—but he couldn\u0027t begin to understand how she was feeling. \"Julian, I\u0027m sorry, but… I saw him,\" she repeated.\\n\\n \"Yeah, and I saw him, too, whoever the hell he was, and I have to admit, it was a damn good thing he showed up when he did. I\u0027m not much brighter than you are, apparently, since I got it into my head to defend you from a pack of wolves.\"\\n\\n She waved a hand in the air. \"Not him,\" she said, though the \"him\" to whom Julian was referring had been almost as disturbing as the man she had first seen. \"Not… not the guy who came along and broke the whole thing up. I mean, I saw the man who was in the coffee shop that day. The day before Andy was killed.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, okay, so you saw him,\" Julian said, hurrying behind her to the door. \"Some bum who was in the coffee shop. You saw him. Great. But… so what? Nikki, I\u0027m sorry to say that we have tons of drunks and addicts in this city. You saw a loser in a coffee shop, and tonight you saw him again. Hell, I run into the same people I don\u0027t really know day after day. And as to this guy—you can\u0027t really think that he followed you all day, through a tour, into the night… and then went after Andy?\"\\n\\n She had reached her door and was suddenly so irritated that she nearly twisted her key in half unlocking the door. Before letting Julian in, she spun on him. \"You don\u0027t understand. Julian, Andy said something about him.\"\\n\\n \"When? At Madame\u0027s?\" he demanded. \"Was he someone she knew? What exactly did she say?\"\\n\\n Fiercely, she shook her head. \"She didn\u0027t know him, or at least I don\u0027t think she did. And she didn\u0027t say anything about him in the café. It was… in the dream. Julian, she said something about him being dead. And I… I think it\u0027s important somehow.\"\\n\\n He stared at her wide-eyed for a moment, then caught her by the shoulders and pushed her forward, into the parlor of her apartment. Once they were inside, he closed and locked the door, then looked at her sternly. \"Nikki, you had a dream. A nightmare. Weird? Yes. The mind plays tricks, but I think you\u0027re just feeling guilty about the fact that Andrea was murdered. People do feel that way—why her, why not me? Nikki, what happened was terrible, tragic things happen on a daily basis. It\u0027s just that usually bad things don\u0027t occur so close to us. So think about it—under these circumstances, it\u0027s a very normal thing that your mind might play tricks. People don\u0027t remember their dreams in detail, so you don\u0027t really know what you dreamed. Listen to yourself. You\u0027re telling me that Andy said the guy was dead, but now you\u0027re certain you saw him on the street. It\u0027s one or the other, Nikki. You\u0027ve got to get a grip.\"\\n\\n \"Julian, what if—\"\\n\\n \"I know a doctor, Nikki. A good one.\"\\n\\n She stared back at him, her mouth open, no sound coming out. At last she found her voice. \"I don\u0027t need a doctor, Julian. I need some faith here.\"\\n\\n \"Nikki, I\u0027m sorry, but… \" He stopped with a sigh, then walked into the living room, hit the light switch and sat down on the Victorian sofa. \"Okay, you really believe that you had a dream, and Andy was in it—right when she was dying.\"\\n\\n \"Or being killed.\"\\n\\n Julian sighed. \"Or being killed. She was talking about the guy you\u0027d seen at Madame\u0027s. Now, tonight, you saw the guy. What you need to do, logically, is go to the police. I think you\u0027ll feel better if you stress to Detective Massey the fact that you\u0027ve seen this guy, this kind of scary bum or junkie, on the street again. Massey can hunt him down and question him.\"\\n\\n She had been standing angrily, her arms crossed over her chest, frowning. But his words made sense.\\n\\n \"Well?\" he demanded.\\n\\n \"All right. I\u0027ll go see Detective Massey. I think I can describe the man fairly well. Maybe they can do a sketch of him. And if they find him and question him… well, I\u0027ll feel better.\"\\n\\n She was startled to realize that Julian was frowning.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" she asked.\\n\\n He shook his head, stared at her. \"Nikki… say that the guy in the coffee shop was a junkie. Hard up. And maybe a psycho to boot. And… what if he did follow us around all day?\"\\n\\n \"What are you getting at?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" he replied quickly.\\n\\n \"What do you mean, nothing?\" she demanded. \"Dammit, Julian, I know you. Tell me what you were going to say.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll only worry you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m worried now.\"\\n\\n Still, Julian hesitated. She didn\u0027t intend to let him off the hook. \"Julian, what?\"\\n\\n He sighed. \"All right, you saw this guy… and who knows, maybe he did know Andy from before.\"\\n\\n \"No, she didn\u0027t recognize him.\"\\n\\n \"She didn\u0027t admit that she recognized him.\"\\n\\n \"No, I really don\u0027t think she recognized him.\"\\n\\n \"But he might have recognized her.\"\\n\\n \"You mean… from sometime before in her life?\"\\n\\n \"Or even from the flyers.\"\\n\\n \"You mean, the business flyers we hand out?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"The minute you saw Andy, you called Max about using her for a new flyer, remember?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m at fault in this somehow,\" Nikki whispered, sinking down on the sofa beside him.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" Julian said firmly. \"Only the killer is at fault. What I\u0027m saying is… well, we might have a psychotic who had a thing for Andy and had been watching her. Or knew about her past. And maybe he knows that you\u0027re suspicious and won\u0027t stop hunting. And if so… well, you could be in danger, too.\"\\n\\n She glared at him, feeling as if her flesh were beginning to crawl.\\n\\n \"I told you, I didn\u0027t want to worry you. And it\u0027s not like you were ever a junkie, but still, you should be careful.\"\\n\\n She groaned, leaning back. Then she jumped up and ran around the house, checking every window to see that it was latched, and making doubly certain that the glass doors that led to the balcony from her bedroom were secured.\\n\\n Julian followed her, double-checking everything.\\n\\n They met in the living room and stared at one another.\\n\\n \"I told you I shouldn\u0027t have said anything,\" he told her.\\n\\n \"No… no, it\u0027s good to be careful,\" she said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m really sorry, Nikki,\" Julian said, running his fingers through his hair. \"Most likely what happened to Andy was… random. I mean, seriously, think about it. All that\u0027s happened is that you saw a guy the day before she died, and you\u0027ve seen him again. That doesn\u0027t mean anything at all. The police will probably just humor us when we go in—I mean, it\u0027s so far from any concrete evidence that anyone could base anything on. You\u0027d have to suspect just about everyone in the city.\"\\n\\n Nikki nodded. \"Right.\" But she didn\u0027t agree. She couldn\u0027t shake the dream. \"All right, well, it seems that we\u0027re locked up tight for the night. I\u0027m going to bed,\" she told him.\\n\\n She leaned over and kissed his cheek, and started for the stairs.\\n\\n \"You want to leave the lights on down here?\" Julian asked.\\n\\n \"Hell, yes,\" she told him.\\n\\n Upstairs, he headed toward the guest bedroom, and she headed toward her own. She paused at the door. \"Hey, Julian.\"\\n\\n \"Um?\"\\n\\n \"Thanks for staying.\"\\n\\n \"Not a problem,\" he assured her.\\n\\n In her room, Nikki quickly changed for bed. No sooner was she under the covers, with the light out, than she jumped up and turned it back on. She was angry with herself, and maybe even a little angry with Julian. The first nights after Andy\u0027s death, he\u0027d stayed with her. But she hadn\u0027t been afraid.\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t thought that she might be stalked.\\n\\n Now…\\n\\n She turned the television on. The first show that popped up was about forensic files. She switched stations. The next show was about cold cases that investigators were going back into.\\n\\n She tried the news, but it was no better. There was a local politician on, the man with the improbable name of Billy Banks, and he was crusading against violent crime in New Orleans, swearing that he would clean it up. He was young, in his early thirties, with the kind of personal charisma a politician prayed for. He talked about cleaning up the image of New Orleans, making it a better destination for families. The man had something, Nikki thought. Not the kind of self-righteousness that people would find offensive, but a determination to make the city better. He might well win the election, she thought; he seemed to have what it would take to breathe excitement into city government. He was a good speaker, and Nikki found herself intrigued by his speech. But then he went on to say that if he were elected, he would see to it that drugs were taken off their local streets, and then they wouldn\u0027t have tragic deaths, like that of the young woman Andrea Ciello.\\n\\n Nikki hit the button on the remote and changed the channel.\\n\\n The next channel she came to was playing a biography of Ted Bundy.\\n\\n She swore, and at last found a kids\u0027 channel that ran old sitcoms at night. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-12.html","bookId":2268,"book":{"id":2268,"title":"Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2)","description":"Storyline: Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2) \\n Nikki DuMonde\u0027s newest employee is standing at the end of her bed at four o\u0027clock in the morning begging for help.
