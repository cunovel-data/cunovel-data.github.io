He\u0027d had the cash to start up the business, she\u0027d had the ability and the knowledge. When he\u0027d hired her, she\u0027d suggested bringing in Julian, who\u0027d been her best friend forever. As they\u0027d prospered, they\u0027d added the rest.\n Nikki was Max\u0027s number two. She was responsible for hiring new guides, then for training them. It worked out well, since Max didn\u0027t particularly like to stick around and run the business. Max liked his money and having other people work for him, so he could travel the globe. At the moment he was hiking in Colorado.\n \"That took long enough,\" Patricia said as they approached the table.\n \"Nikki was flirting,\" Andy teased.\n \"Oh?\" Patricia Broussard had been born and bred in Cajun country, and, like Andy, she had long dark hair. Her eyes were equally dark, and her grin was entirely impish. \"Nikki\u0027s got a guy?\"\n \"Very mysterious,\" Andy said.\n \"I gave a bum a dollar,\" Nikki said, shaking her head.\n \"She gave him a twenty,\" Andy corrected.\n \"He looked like he needed it,\" Nikki said quickly as Julian stared at her in surprise.\n \"Actually, he looked like he might be pretty handsome if you cleaned him up a bit,\" Andy said.\n \"You gave a bum a twenty?\" Mitch, their out-of-towner, a blonde from Pittsburgh, demanded. \"Wow… you\u0027re making a lot more in tips than I am.\"\n \"She\u0027s cuter,\" Patricia told him.\n \"He just seemed really needy,\" Nikki explained. \"So let\u0027s get past this moment, shall we?\"\n \"No, I like this conversation. All work and no play, Nikki… \" Nathan, who was living with Patricia, teased.\n \"Actually,\" Patricia said, eyeing Julian and then Nikki, \"most people think you two are a couple.\"\n \"Ugh,\" Julian said.\n \"Thanks,\" Nikki told him.\n \"No, no, that wasn\u0027t about you,\" Julian protested quickly.\n \"I know,\" Nikki assured him. She stared at Patricia. \"It\u0027s just that we\u0027ve known each other forever. It\u0027s like a brother/sister thing. Now can we get down to business?\"\n But Nathan grinned, leaning forward. \"Nikki, forget business. We\u0027ve got to get you set up with someone.\"\n She sighed deeply. \"I do not want to be set up with anyone.\"\n \"Her last excursion into amore didn\u0027t go so well,\" Julian said with a dramatic sigh. \"But, then, I did tell her not to date the creep.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never seen you date,\" Patricia told her.\n \"That\u0027s because she hasn\u0027t in nearly a year,\" Julian informed them.\n \"What? Why, that\u0027s… un-American,\" Mitch protested.\n Nikki groaned, clenching her teeth. \"He wasn\u0027t a creep. He just wanted to go off to Hollywood and get rich and famous.\"\n \"And he wanted Nikki to come along and support him while he did,\" Julian said dryly.\n \"We had different agendas,\" Nikki said firmly. \"I love this business and I love New Orleans. I like California, but I want to live here. He really wasn\u0027t a jerk.\"\n \"Not a total jerk,\" Patricia interjected. \"He was really good looking, and he could be really sweet.\"\n \"Sweet?\" Mitch queried politely.\n \"Flowers, opening doors… the little things. But in the big things, he wanted his own way.\"\n \"See, I just don\u0027t think that she felt that thing for him, you know? Good-looking guy, charming… but when it\u0027s just not there, it\u0027s just not there,\" Nathan said.\n \"Yeah, but if you always had to wait for it to be there,\" Mitch laughed, \"I\u0027d spend a lot more nights alone than I already do. No wonder you\u0027re so tense, Nikki.\"\n \"I\u0027m not tense,\" Nikki said.\n \"Yeah, and if you don\u0027t get off it, she\u0027ll talk to Max and see that your ass is fired,\" Patricia warned sweetly.\n \"Ouch!\" Mitch said.\n \"Guys, please,\" Nikki said. \"I\u0027m busy, and I\u0027m discerning, and I take my time, okay? And right now we need to worry about work, okay?\"\n Julian turned to Andy. \"Just how decent would this bum of hers be if we cleaned him up?\"\n \"Pretty decent,\" Andy said thoughtfully. \"He just looked… down on his luck.\"\n \"Okay, guys, playtime over,\" Nikki said firmly. \"Julian, Greg wasn\u0027t that much of a creep, just a little self-centered. I had no intention of going anywhere with him, so it was fun, but it\u0027s over. And thanks, but I don\u0027t want to date the bum. I\u0027m fine. I love my apartment, love my work and enjoy my friendship with all you guys. I\u0027m normal, not tense, and when I want to date, I will.\"\n \"Maybe she\u0027s working the strip clubs at night under an alias,\" Mitch teased. She shot him a glare from blue-green eyes. He lifted his hands. \"I\u0027m going to behave now. Really.\"\n \"Okay, guys, I\u0027ve got notes from Max. Mitch, you\u0027re welcome to introduce any new story, as long as you validate it first. Julian, if anyone makes you feel uncomfortable on the walks, tell them you\u0027re married.\"\n \"What?\" Julian said, startled.\n Nikki shrugged. \"That\u0027s what Max said to tell you. He said it works for him all the time.\"\n \"Oh, really? Who would be trying to pick up old Max?\" Julian demanded.\n \"Oh, come on,\" Patricia protested. \"Max is cute—in a creepy kind of way.\"\n \"Great. I say I\u0027m married, then when the right person comes along… they think that I\u0027m married or a liar,\" Julian said. \"There goes my social life.\" He groaned. \"I\u0027ll end up like Nikki.\"\n \"Oh, come on, will you guys please, please leave me alone?\" Nikki demanded.\n \"That bum is looking better and better,\" Julian said to Nathan.\n \"You didn\u0027t even see him,\" Nikki protested, irritated.\n \"We\u0027re just trying to help,\" Nathan said.\n \"I don\u0027t want to be helped,\" Nikki snapped. \"Hey—work on Andy for a while, huh?\"\n On cue, they all turned to stare at Andy. She laughed. \"Nikki, they don\u0027t know me as well. I won\u0027t be nearly as much fun to torture.\"\n \"Besides, Andy is a flirt,\" Nathan said with a dismissive wave of his hand.\n \"Really?\" Andy said.\n \"Yeah, really,\" Mitch assured her.\n Andy giggled. \"Okay… I am a flirt. I admit it.\"\n \"You can flirt with me anytime,\" Julian teased.\n \"And if he\u0027s not around, and you\u0027re looking for a good solid Yankee boy… \" Mitch suggested.\n \"Never play where you work, that\u0027s what Mom always said,\" Andy told them with a sad shake of her head.\n \"Well, you could just sleep with me,\" Mitch said. \"We wouldn\u0027t have to play at all.\"\n \"Hey! Go back to torturing Nikki, will you?\" Andy demanded.\n \"If you all don\u0027t quit, tomorrow night\u0027s off,\" Nikki said.\n \"The tour is off?\" Julian asked, puzzled.\n \"Of course not,\" Nikki said patiently. \"If you\u0027d all just behave like adults and listen… We had a record month. Max is going to pay for a celebration at Pat O\u0027Brien\u0027s. Dinner and drinks on him, tomorrow, after the night tour.\"\n \"All right!\" Mitch cried happily.\n At that moment Madame D\u0027Orso made one of her sweeping appearances, bearing her elegant coffeepot, chatting with her guests.\n And they were special guests. Their tours met in front of her place, bringing her lots of business.\n \"It\u0027s calmed down out here some, huh?\" Nikki asked her.\n \"Yes. Not that I complain about business, but we had a busy late lunch crowd today,\" she told them, pouring them more coffee. At her place, it was premixed. Café au lait meant café au lait.\n \"Hey,\" Mitch said to her, setting a friendly hand on her back, just above her waist. The gesture wasn\u0027t flirtatious, just affectionate. Mitch was in his late twenties. Madame was in her late… well, hard to tell, but she was a few decades older. \"Should Nikki date the bum who was in your place?\"\n \"What bum?\"\n \"You didn\u0027t see him?\" Andy asked.\n \"Honey, I wouldn\u0027t have noticed if Robert E. Lee stopped in. It was busy in there today. As if this parish isn\u0027t nutty enough, it\u0027s election time. Campaigners, do-gooders and politicians everywhere, thick as flies. There\u0027s those trying to clean up the place, make New Orleans a \u0027family\u0027 destination. And then there\u0027s those trying to keep her wild, wicked and free.\" She removed Mitch\u0027s hand, grinned and moved on.\n \"Damn. Wish I\u0027d seen the bum. Then I\u0027d know if we could clean him up enough or not,\" Mitch said with a wink.\n \"Drop it. Or there will be no free meal for you tomorrow night,\" Nikki warned him.\n \"It\u0027s dropped,\" he assured her.\n Nikki rose. She could see a tour group gathering out front. \"Julian, it\u0027s showtime. Andy, you\u0027re following along. Patricia, Nathan, don\u0027t forget you\u0027re on tonight.\"\n With a last long swallow of her café au lait, Nikki started off with a smile to meet the growing crowd. Twenty minutes later, she was standing in front of the Bourbon Street bar, once a blacksmith\u0027s shop, that the pirate turned patriot Jean Lafitte was said to haunt. She found the story of the man a fascinating puzzle, and focused her speech on his enigmatic history, along with a mention that there were definitely \"spirits\" of all sorts to be found there—many of them behind the bar.\n Her smile was as enigmatic as her story. She was certain that Jean Lafitte\u0027s ghost loved to have his story told. She could feel the mischief in the air, something a little wicked, and yet benign.\n She always told the story of the man with affection, and she knew that she always gave her audience a few delightful chills.\n Ghosts filled the streets here, between the neon lights that advertised Girls! Girls! Girls! and the shop fronts offering voodoo charms, the ever-present music, the mimes on the street, the antique shops, the boutiques and the T-shirt shops that also sold pralines and potions. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-2.html","bookId":2268,"book":{"id":2268,"title":"Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2) \n Nikki DuMonde\u0027s newest employee is standing at the end of her bed at four o\u0027clock in the morning begging for help.
