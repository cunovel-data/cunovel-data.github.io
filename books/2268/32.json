She gave us your name.\"\n He groaned.\n \"You know her, right?\" Massey said.\n \"Yes. She was on the tour yesterday. But the cemetery was closed and locked. Surely she and her friends knew to stay out of the area.\"\n \"Apparently not. One of her friends had some book on conjuring up the spirits of the deceased. She wanted to do some ritual and apologize to the slaves on behalf of her ancestors.\"\n Brent shook his head, both sorry and angry. When the hell would people learn?\n \"How badly is she hurt?\"\n \"Conk on the head, a few bruises and scratches. When rocks started flying, her friends crawled back over the gate. They screamed, got the cops on patrol. This girl, Marie McManus, didn\u0027t see or hear anyone. She just got it from behind. But she wanted to talk to you. And who the hell knows, you might be able to find something out.\"\n \"Sure. I\u0027m happy to see her,\" Brent said.\n Marie McManus looked frightened and bruised. She was anxious to leave the hospital, but was being kept twenty-four hours for observation. She had brushed her hair, but she wasn\u0027t wearing makeup, and she looked young and really scared.\n \"Hi. Thanks for coming,\" she said.\n She was in a small private room, barely allowing enough room for both him and McManus.\n \"What on earth were you doing?\" Brent asked her. \"I told you last night that it was dangerous to go anywhere near the cemeteries at night.\"\n She flushed, looking downward. \"Honestly, we weren\u0027t going to vandalize the place or anything. I\u0027d gotten some candles at one of the voodoo shops… a little silver cross, some herbs. We were just going to sneak in and say a little prayer. But then someone started throwing rocks, and someone bashed me in the head. The next thing I knew, I was here, at the hospital.\"\n Brent glanced at Massey and discreetly shrugged. \"Marie, you\u0027re lucky you weren\u0027t killed.\"\n \"I know that now,\" she murmured. She flashed a glance at Massey. \"The detective told me that it\u0027s going to be almost impossible for them to find who did this.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure what makes you think I can help you, then,\" Brent said.\n She shook her head. \"I… know. I didn\u0027t really want you to help me, I guess… I guess I felt that I needed to apologize.\"\n He shook his head and spoke gently. \"Marie, you were the victim. Some hood needs to apologize to you. But if you want to help in the future, help the cops. Stay out of areas where they warn you that it\u0027s dangerous to be, okay?\"\n She nodded. \"You said you had information on my ancestor, Archibald McManus. May I have it?\"\n \"You can probably find out more than I did at the library, but I\u0027ll be happy to give you what I\u0027ve got. I\u0027ll try to get back out here sometime soon.\"\n \"No, no… We\u0027re staying in the French Quarter—Josie, Sarah and me. If you wouldn\u0027t mind just dropping it at my hotel, I\u0027d really appreciate it.\"\n \"All right. And you swear you won\u0027t go near that cemetery again without lots of people in tow?\"\n \"I swear,\" she told him.\n He wished her well, Massey did the same, and they left. \"What do you make of it?\" Massey asked him.\n Brent shrugged. \"I think she\u0027s lucky that all she came out with were a few bruises.\"\n \"Yeah, my take exactly. She didn\u0027t see anything.\" He sighed with disgust. \"They never see anything. Well, if you can think of any thing… let me know. Where shall I drop you?\"\n Brent glanced at his watch. Not a lot of time before he needed to be in the Garden District, but all he had to do was run up the street from St. Louis Number 1 to the trolley, and he wouldn\u0027t need more than a few minutes to reach Lafayette Number 1.\n \"The cemetery. I\u0027ll take a look around myself this morning.\"\n \"We\u0027ve already pulled the crime tape, and tourists are moving around in there.\"\n He nodded. \"I\u0027ll take a quick look anyway.\"\n \"Think one of your ghostly buddies can help?\" Massey asked.\n Brent looked at him. He wasn\u0027t sure if Massey was mocking him, or if he was just beginning to feel desperate.\n \"I just wouldn\u0027t mind taking a look around,\" he said. \"I hear there\u0027s a political debate in Jackson Square today. You boys will be busy.\"\n \"The uniforms will have a tough time, yeah,\" Massey agreed.\n A few minutes later he dropped Brent off right at the gates. Brent promised to keep him advised regarding anything he learned.\n There were several tour groups going through, but they seemed to be massing at the tomb of Marie Laveau. Brent chose the back wall, by the oven vaults.\n He waited a second, watched the last of a group walk around a tomb, and said in a low but heated voice, \"Huey, you get your sorry ass out here right now.\"\n A moment later, pale and gray, barely substantial at all, Huey appeared. \"My sorry ass? Who the hell are you to talk about my sorry ass?\"\n \"Huey, you hurt that girl.\"\n \"You\u0027re puffed full of cotton, son, and that\u0027s putting it nicely. What the hell do you want, Injun boy?\" he demanded. There was a guilty tone in his voice. Guilty and defiant.\n \"Huey, you\u0027ve gotten real powerful in here. You can pretty much do things I\u0027ve never seen another ghost manage.\"\n \"Spirit or essence, that\u0027s what we liked to be called these days,\" Huey cackled. \"Well, that\u0027s what one o\u0027 dem wise-talking rangers said.\"\n \"Great. Now you\u0027re going to start being politically correct? The \u0027essence\u0027 who calls me Injun boy all the time?\"\n \"It offend you?\" Huey asked.\n \"No. What offends me is violence. There was no reason for you to hurt that girl.\"\n Huey hung his head, then looked up, his eyes flashing. \"Actually, I didn\u0027t mean to go hurting her. Honest Injun,\" he said, and laughed at his own pun. \"And I wasn\u0027t the one who did hurt her, not unless it was by accident or she got hurt running out of here.\"\n \"You threw something at her by accident?\"\n \"Nah… these fellas were in here again last night. Bad seeds, real bad seeds, I just know it.\"\n \"What fellas?\"\n Huey waved a hand in the air. \"Junkies. And not junkies. Folks giving stuff to other folks to make some money. They don\u0027t care about the cemetery. They got no respect for the dead. Hell, they ain\u0027t got no respect for the living, either. Them girls… \" He shook his head with sad but tolerant impatience. \"They\u0027re just silly. Don\u0027t know what folks think… don\u0027t know what gets into \u0027em. They shouldn\u0027t be in this place after dark, and that\u0027s a known fact. They just got in the way. Bad folks are in the cemetery after dark. Them girls were lucky they weren\u0027t kilt, and that\u0027s a plain fact.\"\n \"I need to know who those bad seeds are, Huey. If I can get them, catch them in the act, the cops can put them away, and you won\u0027t have to worry about them anymore.\"\n Huey shrugged. \"Don\u0027t know if I could rightly point them out to you—not if they walked in on a tour this minute. Don\u0027t it just beat all? Eighteen million degrees in the shade, and them guys wear knit masks.\"\n \"Do they come every night?\"\n Huey looked around, shaking his head. \"Not every night. I never know exactly when they\u0027ll come. But… they\u0027ve been coming.\"\n \"A while now?\"\n \"Hell, yeah. Weeks… maybe even a month or more. Every few nights… I never know.\"\n \"Thanks. I\u0027ll be back around. You still haven\u0027t seen the FBI guy, huh? Tom Garfield.\"\n Huey shook his head. \"Now how the hell would I know? We dead folk don\u0027t just go around introducing ourselves to one another, you know. We\u0027ve got our own things to do. I mean, you don\u0027t go saying who you are to everyone on the street now, do you?\"\n \"Try to help me, Huey, please. And by the way, that McManus girl was trying to say prayers for you.\"\n \"All right, all right… if\u0027n I can help, I will. And hey, I\u0027m telling you God\u0027s truth. I didn\u0027t hurt that girl.\" He hesitated. \"I think I helped her. I did do some rock throwing, but I was aiming at the bad guys.\"\n \"Good man, Huey.\"\n \"She\u0027s still a McManus.\" Huey sniffed.\n \"Not her fault, Huey. I\u0027m going to get the cops watching the cemetery, looking out for your junkies, Huey.\"\n Huey cocked his head, looking at Brent. \"I\u0027d be careful on that. I mean, if you really want to catch these fellows. They see cops… they\u0027ll just move on over somewhere else. There\u0027s plenty of dark corners in N\u0027Awlins for them folks to find. You want to catch \u0027em, better not spook \u0027em out of here.\"\n \"Good point, Huey, thanks.\"\n A tour director was coming around the corner of one of the majestic society vaults. Huey faded away.\n Brent slipped past the group and exited the cemetery. As he came out onto the sidewalk, he was startled when a man almost collided with him.\n He looked up.\n It was the FBI man, Haggerty. Today he was in a baseball cap, sunglasses, jeans and a tailored shirt. Seeing Brent in his way, he swore. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" he growled.\n \"Visiting the cemetery.\"\n Haggerty swore again. Brent assessed his appearance. The man was good. He no longer looked like a stereotypical agent.\n Haggerty came closer to him. \"Look, you idiot, don\u0027t screw me up. I work alone, I keep away from others, you got it? I don\u0027t like talking to other cops—even other feds—when I\u0027m working. A man can get killed that way. So I sure as hell don\u0027t want to see you. Now get the hell out of my way, and never, ever act like you know me.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-32.html","bookId":2268,"book":{"id":2268,"title":"Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2) \n Nikki DuMonde\u0027s newest employee is standing at the end of her bed at four o\u0027clock in the morning begging for help.
