She\u0027s gone and in God\u0027s hands.\"\\n\\n \"Do you believe that? Really believe that?\"\\n\\n \"Do I believe in God? Yes. And that after death, we can\u0027t be hurt anymore? Yes.\" She couldn\u0027t see his face clearly, but the rich tone of his voice was reassuring. He sighed softly, smoothing back her hair. \"Patricia, you should think of Andy now as being in heaven, looking after us.\"\\n\\n He pulled her close then, spooning himself around her. For a second, a fleeting second, she longed to break free.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s going to take all of us time to get over it,\" he murmured. Then he yawned. \"Especially Nikki. She still doesn\u0027t look… \"\\n\\n \"Good?\" Patricia suggested.\\n\\n He was quiet for a minute. \"Sane,\" he said. He pulled her closer against his body. \"We\u0027ve all gotta keep an eye on her.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh,\" Patricia murmured.\\n\\n \"If she acts too strange around you, tell me, huh?\"\\n\\n Patricia inched away a bit. \"What do you mean, too strange?\"\\n\\n \"You know. Strange.\"\\n\\n \"Well, of course, I—\"\\n\\n \"Shh… \"\\n\\n His hand crept from its gentle hold around her midriff so that his finger rested against her lips. \"No more for now. We\u0027ve got to move on now.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t help but think—\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll stop you thinking,\" he murmured.\\n\\n He rolled her around so that she faced him. He didn\u0027t bring his lips against her mouth, but straight against her throat. He allowed his tongue a slow easy slide down to her rib cage.\\n\\n \"Nathan, I… \"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re alive,\" he said, his voice muffled against her flesh. \"And we\u0027re going to keep on living.\"\\n\\n \"Nathan… \"\\n\\n No slow teasing. Nathan slid his length down against her, lips going straight between her thighs, startling, forceful, sensuous.\\n\\n She swallowed, felt instant arousal shooting through her. Her fingers tore into his hair; his hands lifted her higher still.\\n\\n \"Nathan… just do… \"\\n\\n \"Just do what?\"\\n\\n \"Me.\"\\n\\n Another day.\\n\\n Owen Massey lay in bed, staring at the dust motes that played in the air. He\u0027d left the drapes an inch open; the morning light showed the shabbiness of his little house out on I—10.\\n\\n He might work the Quarter, but he couldn\u0027t afford to live in it.\\n\\n \"Yeah, another day,\" he muttered.\\n\\n After a moment, he rolled over, crawled out of bed. He could hear the wheeze and whine of his old air-conditioning system. It could wheeze and whine as much as it wanted, just so long as it didn\u0027t break down. The summer heat was coining on. Killer heat. That was what they called it.\\n\\n People snapped when it was too hot. But when someone just snapped, there were usually witnesses.\\n\\n No cover-up.\\n\\n Another day.\\n\\n He walked into the kitchen, glad he\u0027d invested in a good coffeemaker. Every day, at six forty-five, it automatically started brewing his coffee. Every day, when he came out at seven o\u0027clock, it was ready for him.\\n\\n He poured a cup, found his cigarettes—a no-no in the department, even in New Orleans, these days. But this was his house. Shabby it might be, but he owned it. He lit his cigarette. \"So there,\" he said to no one and everyone.\\n\\n Another day. Another stinking hot day.\\n\\n No matter how someone had wanted it to appear, the death of Andrea Ciello had not been an accident. His gut agreed with Blackhawk. The man had made him feel like an idiot. Two people dead, the same way. Joulette would realize the truth of it soon enough.\\n\\n Another day.\\n\\n Massey rubbed his eyes. Another day of staring at what they had. Of trying desperately to find another angle. Not that the FBI were doing any better with the death of one of their own. Something had to break soon. A straight-as-an-arrow guy, suddenly dead of an overdose. No fingerprints found but his own. A girl—albeit a onetime junkie—dead the same way. Not a hair, not a fiber… no psychotic was that organized.\\n\\n Everyone going in circles.\\n\\n Except for the ghost guy.\\n\\n The one person who\u0027d seen clearly from the get-go that the two crimes were related.\\n\\n Hell!\\n\\n Massey crushed out his cigarette and rose, standing in front of the wheezing air conditioner and letting the cooling draft wash over him.\\n\\n Just how much could the ghost guy see?\\n\\n It seemed like a good morning.\\n\\n Nikki didn\u0027t remember when she had slept so well, though when she awoke she had to wonder if she was really in her right mind, having asked a stranger to spend the night.\\n\\n But sleeping so well had been wonderful. Now, aware of her physical attraction to the man, she showered, dressed and did her makeup before leaving her room, even to put the coffee on.\\n\\n But she needn\u0027t have worried about the coffee. Her guest had started the pot.\\n\\n She poured a cup and found him out in the courtyard.\\n\\n \"Good morning,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Good morning.\" Those eyes of his were instantly on her. She decided to get a firm grip on the physical-attraction thing, she thought. He studied her gravely, as if he were a zoologist and she were a rare species—but nothing else. And yet…\\n\\n There was something going on. She liked the feeling of being with him, of having him near her.\\n\\n \"Sleep well?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Perfectly. You? Julian complains about the bed in there all the time.\"\\n\\n He arched a brow. \"It\u0027s not so bad.\" He sipped the coffee he had fixed himself. Then she wondered if there wasn\u0027t just the slightest change in his eyes as he frowned. \"So Julian… is he gay?\"\\n\\n She shook her head, smiling. It was strange that people either made the assumption that there was something between them or else Julian had to be gay.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n She laughed aloud then and realized that the sound was good. \"Sleeping with Julian would be like sleeping with my brother. It\u0027s as simple as that. I\u0027ve heard that it\u0027s impossible for a man and woman to be friends without one of them wanting more, but we really are just friends, and always have been.\"\\n\\n \"I see.\"\\n\\n She wondered exactly how much he saw.\\n\\n \"Tell me about the people who work with you,\" he said. \"And who the hell is Max, and where is he in all this?\"\\n\\n \"Max has money and bankrolled the business. He\u0027s also a genius when it comes to delegating work. He has me, so he can travel. I don\u0027t know where he is right now. Colorado or someplace. And the others… tell you what about them?\"\\n\\n \"You know. Who they are, how you met them, what their relationships are with one another, how long you\u0027ve known them… all that.\"\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t sure why, but she was instantly on the defensive. \"You\u0027re asking because of Andy?\" she said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m asking because I\u0027m trying to get a better picture of the situation.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re nice people, all of them,\" she said angrily.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not saying they\u0027re not,\" he told her, green eyes on her. \"I\u0027m just trying to get a sense of things.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you were supposed to be helping with the murder of the FBI agent,\" she said sharply.\\n\\n \"I am. But I\u0027m convinced that Andrea Ciello was a murder victim, and that the murders are related. Otherwise, I can\u0027t begin to imagine why you keep seeing the both of them. Not to mention the obvious. Two overdoses. Heroin. Needle marks in the same place in the arm.\"\\n\\n \"But Andy used to be a junkie.\"\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t matter. You know she didn\u0027t do it to herself.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027m insane. Dealing with delusions because of misplaced guilt. And maybe you\u0027re in an even worse delusional state. Totally out of your mind,\" she informed him. He didn\u0027t rise to anger; he just kept looking at her with those eyes that seemed far too wise and compelling.\\n\\n She looked away. He\u0027d made her angry, but that only increased her urge to touch him, which made her angrier still.\\n\\n \"You want to know my tour guides? Let\u0027s head over to Madame\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Madame D\u0027Orso\u0027s? That\u0027s where you first saw Garfield.\"\\n\\n \"I thought he was a bum.\"\\n\\n He made a face. \"I need to, uh, shower and change. I\u0027ll have to head back to my bed-and-breakfast first.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you just shower and change here? Julian has some clothes in the closet, and you\u0027re about the same size.\"\\n\\n \"I hate to take his things.\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t mind. It\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n He hesitated. She was still feeling the tension of anger, but she didn\u0027t want him leaving, no matter how much he got to her.\\n\\n \"Really. He\u0027s a nice guy, and he dresses well. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll find something.\"\\n\\n He lifted his hands, then let them fall to his sides. \"All right.\"\\n\\n Nikki decided not to go in with him; he could fend for himself. She had to keep some distance. She barely knew him, despite the fact she\u0027d invited him to sleep at her house. She was sure that this pathetic urge to throw herself at the man had to be some strange psychosis seizing her because of what had happened.\\n\\n And it wasn\u0027t as if he had attempted to knock down her door last night. As far as she knew, she thought dryly, he hadn\u0027t come near it.\\n\\n \"Go ahead, shower, take what you need. I\u0027ll be out here.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" he said, still looking at her strangely.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing, sorry. I\u0027ll get ready.\"\\n\\n She nodded.\\n\\n A few minutes later he came back down, smelling of soap and shampoo and faintly of aftershave, and appearing even more attractive in his slightly damp state.\\n\\n \"Lock up,\" he told her gravely.\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n The café was busy, but Madame greeted Nikki with her customary friendliness, despite the line that stretched along the counter.\\n\\n \"Nikki, good morning, you\u0027re the first to arrive. Just take your usual table.\" She smiled at Brent. \"Hi, I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve been properly introduced. I\u0027m Madame D\u0027Orso. Everyone just calls me Madame,\" she said, a slight smile curving her lips. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-24.html","bookId":2268,"book":{"id":2268,"title":"Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2)","description":"Storyline: Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2) \\n Nikki DuMonde\u0027s newest employee is standing at the end of her bed at four o\u0027clock in the morning begging for help.
