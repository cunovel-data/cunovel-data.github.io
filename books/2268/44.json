Before she could answer him, she found herself looking around the bar. But she didn\u0027t see anyone who looked suspicious, or even anyone she knew.\n \"New Orleans.\"\n \"Really?\" Max said. \"I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve never seen him before.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure there are a lot of people here who never cross our paths,\" Nikki said. \"And he hasn\u0027t lived here, not for a while.\"\n \"So he just kind of appeared at the right time, huh?\" Max asked.\n Julian started to speak. Not at all sure why, Nikki kicked him. He managed to keep quiet, but he shot her a look that said it was time she saw the psychiatrist again.\n \"He definitely appeared at the right time,\" Nikki said.\n Julian added, \"I\u0027ll tell you this, Max, he knows his stuff.\"\n \"So, Max, tell us more about the shrimpers,\" Nikki said, anxious to turn the conversation in some other direction.\n Max warmed to his cause so much so that Nikki found herself drawn in, despite the fact that she\u0027d expected to be unable to think of anything but the coming night. As she listened, though, she found herself growing indignant for the people who worked so hard, and decided that from now on she would eat only home-caught shrimp.\n Even so, at the back of her mind raced a single question.\n Where had Brent gone now?\n And why?\n At his bed-and-breakfast, Brent put through a call to Adam.\n He would never know how the man managed to do it, but within twenty minutes he was able to report that Haggerty was a bona fide agent, and yes, he was known for being a loner.\n Adam also managed to access the recent expenditures of Max Dupuis.\n Brent ran over his expenses during the last two weeks.\n There hadn\u0027t been a single charge made in the parish of New Orleans for over two weeks. He moved on, pulling up the dossiers that Adam had managed to acquire on Julian and the others. There wasn\u0027t a criminal record in the lot.\n Well, except for Andrea Ciello. She had been busted and jailed several times. But she had cleaned up and made it through school. And there hadn\u0027t been a mark on her record in several years. She had attended rehab, and since then, she\u0027d been clean.\n He\u0027d expected nothing else.\n Studying everything that he had, albeit quickly, he couldn\u0027t find anything to suggest that any of Andy\u0027s close circle might have gotten involved in a major drug operation.\n Julian and Nikki had indeed attended the same schools; Julian had been a year ahead of her. He\u0027d been a theater major, an honor student. He\u0027d done his share of work as a bartender, spent a few months in Europe, and he had performed a one-man show at a small local theater before working with the tour group.\n Nothing there.\n He stared at everything, shook his head and called Adam back. \"Get me what you can on the two cops, Marc Joulette and Owen Massey. Oh… and anything more you can find out about the FBI agent, Haggerty. And a café, a place called Madame D\u0027Orso\u0027s. Check out the woman who owns it, while you\u0027re at it.\" He thought quickly, then asked for whatever Adam could get on the voodoo shop that Nikki liked. \"Contessa Moodoo\u0027s Hoodoo Voodoo.\"\n \"I can get you some records pretty quickly. Getting anything deeper on the cops and especially the fed may take a little longer.\"\n \"Do what you can,\" Brent said, and thanked him.\n A few minutes later he was studying the newest records Adam sent, but, as Adam had warned him, there wasn\u0027t much there. Brent looked at the grainy images of the men as they appeared on his screen. In a hundred years, he would never have recognized Massey in me youthful picture he had. Joulette\u0027s image was pretty good; Haggerty must have had a hair-and-makeup artist for his official picture.\n Madame D\u0027Orso, nee Debra Smith, had come from the North about fifteen years ago. She\u0027d gotten financing through a local bank, and was apparently paying back her loan in a timely manner.\n The voodoo shop had previously been a toy store. Before she took over the location, Contessa had operated in downtown New Orleans. Having become extremely successful, she had moved to her present location, with its high overhead, nearly four years ago.\n Frustrated, he logged off. He strapped on his ankle holster and snub-nosed Smith \u0026 Wesson, grabbed the packet he had acquired on Archibald McManus and hurried out.\n He had to pass Marie\u0027s hotel, so he figured he would just leave the material with the concierge. But Marie exited the elevator just as he was approaching the desk. She came running toward him, took the packet and thanked him profusely.\n \"You\u0027re doing all right?\" he asked her.\n She was still bruised, but she flushed and smiled. \"I\u0027m fine. I was lucky, and you know what else?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I think there are ghosts.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"I think the ghost of that old slave may have saved me, and I\u0027m going to try to do something for him.\"\n \"Marie, he\u0027s dead. He\u0027s been dead for over a hundred years. Don\u0027t go near that cemetery.\"\n She laughed. \"I know, but I\u0027m still going to find something to do for him. And when I have it figured out, I\u0027ll call you first.\" She hesitated. \"You know, there\u0027s something bad going on in that area.\"\n \"Don\u0027t go back at night. In fact, don\u0027t go back at all without a ranger or a group.\"\n \"I won\u0027t. I swear.\"\n He wished Nikki would be as careful, but in a way, he understood. There was no way he would refuse to fight back if he knew that someone was after him.\n He glanced at his watch and hurried on.\n On a sidewalk just a few blocks away, he waited in the shadows. In time he saw Patricia and Nathan leaving her apartment, heading for Madame\u0027s. He followed them, keeping a discreet distance, doing his best to listen in on their conversation.\n It was casual. Patricia said that she wanted to lead the tour that night, and Nathan said she was more than welcome to, because he was exhausted.\n When Patricia went into Madame\u0027s for coffee, Brent slid into the chair opposite Nathan.\n Startled, Nathan began to greet him, then went silent when he saw the look in Brent\u0027s eyes.\n \"I\u0027m running out of time,\" Brent said flatly.\n \"Excuse me?\"\n \"I\u0027ve seen you at night,\" Brent lied. \"But I haven\u0027t quite figured out where you\u0027ve been going.\"\n Nathan immediately flushed a deep red. \"I—I don\u0027t know what the hell you\u0027re talking about.\"\n \"It won\u0027t take Patricia long to buy coffee. And I\u0027ll be happy to ask the question with her here.\"\n Nathan stared at him, his color deepening even further. Finally he leaned closer over the table. \"If you\u0027re suggesting that I would have hurt Andy in any way, that I would deal in drugs—\"\n \"I\u0027m not suggesting anything. I want the truth. And I hope it\u0027s something you can prove.\"\n Brent glanced toward the windows. He could see Patricia at the counter. Madame wasn\u0027t there; a pretty young girl was taking Patricia\u0027s money.\n \"Ticktock, she\u0027ll be here any second.\"\n Patricia had paid. She was heading toward the door.\n \"Good God, yes, it was another woman,\" Nathan blurted quickly. \"But it\u0027s over. Really over. Please… I don\u0027t know what I was doing. I\u0027d rushed into this living-together thing, and I was feeling trapped and—\"\n \"Not good enough,\" Brent said.\n \"I met her at the bar,\" Nathan said, looking over Brent\u0027s shoulder. \"Her name is Varina White. She\u0027s from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and she\u0027s gone, but I have a phone number. For the love of God—\"\n \"If I find out you\u0027re lying… \" Brent said softly, letting the threat hang unspoken in the air, then he jumped up. \"Patricia,\" he said, and pulled out a chair.\n \"Brent, I didn\u0027t know you were here. I would have gotten you a coffee.\"\n \"It\u0027s all right. I just saw Nathan and thought I\u0027d say hi. I\u0027ve got to get going. Hey, I didn\u0027t even tell Nathan yet. Max is back. Got to meet him today.\"\n \"Cool,\" Patricia said, looking slightly anxious.\n \"Strange guy, huh?\" Brent said.\n \"Strange, definitely. But he\u0027s a good guy. Into different causes all the time,\" Nathan said. He looked shaky as he poured sugar into his coffee.\n \"Sure you won\u0027t join us?\" Patricia asked.\n \"No, I\u0027ll leave you two lovebirds alone. Stick close, okay?\" he said. \"After what happened to Nikki… \"\n \"I intend to stick to Nathan like glue,\" she said.\n \"Good thing. See ya.\"\n He turned and walked away. He\u0027d learned to be a pretty good judge of character. He would bet his life that Nathan had been telling him the truth, but at the same time, he was wondering how he had managed to bully the man into doing it quite so easily.\n He glanced at his watch. It was growing late. There was nothing more he could do this evening.\n Swearing, he hurried toward Nikki\u0027s.\n \"Well, kids, stuff to do,\" Max said, yawning. \"And sleep. I haven\u0027t done much of that lately.\" He turned serious suddenly, looking at Nikki. \"Thanks. And I\u0027m sorry. I guess I\u0027ve dumped a lot on you lately. And I should have come back for the funeral. I\u0027m more selfish than I knew. You\u0027ve been great, keeping everything going for me.\"\n Nikki shrugged. \"Hey, you always said that you were the moneyman, that you believed in delegation.\"\n \"You should make her a partner in the business,\" Julian said.\n Max frowned. \"Hey, I just bought you drinks and a session at the raw bar,\" he protested. He kissed Nikki on the cheek. \"Okay, major meeting tomorrow, for real,\" he said, looking at Julian. \"I\u0027m going to actually do some work myself. I promise,\" he said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-44.html","bookId":2268,"book":{"id":2268,"title":"Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2) \n Nikki DuMonde\u0027s newest employee is standing at the end of her bed at four o\u0027clock in the morning begging for help.
