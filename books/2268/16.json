They\u0027re good, I understand. They do history tours, with an emphasis on ghosts and spooky stuff. And she\u0027s a native,\" Massey told him. \"Of New Orleans, I mean,\" he added hastily. He frowned suddenly. \"What the hell made you show her Tom\u0027s picture, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"Just a hunch,\" Brent said.\\n\\n \"Tom was dead. She couldn\u0027t have seen him last night,\" Massey said. \"Tell me you don\u0027t really believe she could have seen a ghost?\"\\n\\n \"She saw something,\" Brent said evenly.\\n\\n \"You really are one of those psychics, huh?\" Massey said.\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m not a psychic,\" Brent told him.\\n\\n \"Then… ?\" Joulette asked.\\n\\n \"A researcher.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" Joulette pressed. \"What kind?\"\\n\\n Brent smiled, shaking his head. \"Let\u0027s just say \u0027different\u0027 for now, huh? I don\u0027t want to alienate you before we get started. I get the feeling you\u0027re both good at what you do. I\u0027ll bet your CSI folks are good at what they do, too. I just come at things from a different angle.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got plenty of voodoo in New Orleans already,\" Joulette drawled, challenging him.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t practice voodoo,\" Brent said evenly.\\n\\n Both detectives studied him, and Massey said, \"Whoever or whatever you are, your boss is apparently in with me bigwigs. We have the FBI in on this, too. Lots of agents, one main liaison between the departments. Guy\u0027s name is Haggerty. And he says you\u0027re definitely not a fed. In fact, he has his panties in a knot about you being here.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\" Brent said. He wasn\u0027t surprised that the FBI had men on the case—they\u0027d lost one of their own.\\n\\n \"Yeah, Vince Haggerty isn\u0027t into mumbo jumbo,\" Massey responded.\\n\\n Brent ignored the mumbo-jumbo part. \"You\u0027re conducting separate investigations?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Not really,\" Joulette said. \"Haggerty has access to everything we\u0027ve got. But the guy is a real loner. He wants to work on his own, and doesn\u0027t want to share what he has. He will give us whatever he\u0027s got eventually. If we can find him. You\u0027d think Owen and I grew up in the bayou and never went to school, the way he acts. Or,\" he added bitterly, \"that I should still be saying \u0027Massuh\u0027 when I talk to the guy.\"\\n\\n \"So, here we are,\" Massey said. \"Marc and I working two cases… and in neither case do we have so much as a semisolid lead to anything. At least in Garfield\u0027s case we can hit the clubs, get some help from the narcs. As to the Andrea Ciello case, well, I\u0027d hoped Nikki DuMonde would be able to give us something solid. All she did was hand us a ghost.\"\\n\\n Brent was silent for a moment, then lifted his shoulders and let out a sigh. \"I think I\u0027ll take one of Miss DuMonde\u0027s tours,\" he said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s how you\u0027re going to find a killer?\" Joulette said skeptically.\\n\\n \"I think your murders have something to do with one another,\" Brent said flatly.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t even know that the girl\u0027s death was a murder. What makes you think the two deaths are connected?\" Massey said. \"A fed, undercover, and a former junkie. What motive could connect them?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. But you\u0027re looking at two heroin overdoses.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, he\u0027s a psychic,\" Joulette told Massey.\\n\\n \"Look, guys—\" Brent began.\\n\\n But Joulette started to laugh. \"Hey, go for it, man.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, you do what you have to do,\" Massey said.\\n\\n Brent arched a brow.\\n\\n \"We actually kinda like you,\" Joulette explained. \u0027\"Cause you\u0027re not some superior fed.\"\\n\\n \"Next to him, hell, you can bring in all the ghost busters, voodoo priestesses, palm readers… whatever. You want \u0027em, you bring \u0027em on,\" Massey said.\\n\\n \"Great. Well, then, gentlemen, let me get to it. And I swear, what I know, you\u0027ll know,\" Brent promised.\\n\\n Brent left the station thinking the two of them were probably laughing at his expense.\\n\\n But what the hell, they liked him.\\n\\n Things could be worse.\\n\\n Dr. Boulet was a man of about forty. He was pleasant, nicely dressed and comfortable to talk to.\\n\\n He did have a couch, but he also had an easy chair.\\n\\n \"Am I supposed to lie down?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"If you like. Or just take a seat.\"\\n\\n She chose the chair.\\n\\n \"So what\u0027s the problem?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m seeing dead people.\"\\n\\n \"Do you want to give me a few details?\"\\n\\n She waved a hand in the air. \"Ghosts.\"\\n\\n \"Have you always seen ghosts?\" he asked, not blinking.\\n\\n She smiled, lowering her head. \"Only since my friend died. Or maybe right before she died.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you tell me the story from the beginning.\"\\n\\n She did, and he paid rapt attention, his expression grave. He took notes.\\n\\n When she had explained it all—starting with the man in the café and ending with her recent shock at the police station—he quit writing and waited.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Do you really believe in ghosts?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I must—I\u0027m seeing them now.\"\\n\\n His smile deepened. \"But you didn\u0027t—before all this?\"\\n\\n \"Um… no.\"\\n\\n \"Even though you give ghost tours for a living?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve always had a… sense, I guess you\u0027d call it.\"\\n\\n \"A sense?\"\\n\\n She waved a hand vaguely in the air. \"I don\u0027t know how to explain it. When… I\u0027m in certain places, I can feel past events… even see something like a mist.\"\\n\\n \"Aha.\" He started to write.\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s not an aha!\" Nikki protested. \"I\u0027ve never actually seen a ghost before, and sure as hell, one never talked to me before.\"\\n\\n \"Someone important to you died tragically,\" he reminded her softly.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Well, the mind is far more incredible than any computer. You might have imagined your dream, you see. It might have been implanted when you heard what happened, or even when the policeman came up to you. Take déjà vu for instance. We go somewhere, and we know we\u0027ve never been there, but it\u0027s familiar. So… were we there in another lifetime? Or has the brain given us a memory that doesn\u0027t exist?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re asking me?\" Nikki said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m giving you suggestions. When someone close to us is killed, mere\u0027s often a matter of guilt. Survivor\u0027s guilt, it\u0027s called. She\u0027s dead, I\u0027m not.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t feel guilty. I don\u0027t feel that I should be dead. I\u0027m horrified that Andy died, and I\u0027m angry. I\u0027m furious that someone could do that to her.\"\\n\\n At that point, he looked at his watch.\\n\\n The sigh he gave then was everything she would have imagined, as were his next words.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re out of time. You might want to think about the things I\u0027ve said. And schedule an appointment for next week with my secretary. Do you want something to help you sleep?\"\\n\\n \"Pills?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n \"Positive, thank you.\"\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027ll meet again. And we\u0027ll get to the bottom of this,\" he assured her cheerfully.\\n\\n \"So… I\u0027m not exactly… crazy?\" she asked pleasantly.\\n\\n \"The mind, as I said, is incredible. You\u0027ve been through a terrible trauma. You want answers. You want an explanation for how something so terrible happened. There could be many reasons.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe ghosts really exist,\" she suggested.\\n\\n \"In our minds, of course they do. When we love someone and lose them, they\u0027re always with us, in a way.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t love a stranger I never saw before,\" Nikki said.\\n\\n \"No… but the memory of having seen him not long before Andy\u0027s death might be confusing the picture.\"\\n\\n \"A logical explanation for everything,\" Nikki murmured.\\n\\n \"It can take some time to get all the ghosts out of our minds,\" he said, glancing at his watch again.\\n\\n Nikki rose. \"Thanks,\" she managed to say.\\n\\n Julian was pacing the waiting room when she came out. He rushed quickly to her side. \"Well? Do you feel better?\"\\n\\n \"No, not really.\"\\n\\n \"Did he say you were having delusions or… well, what the hell did he say?\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t call me crazy. He talked about the mind playing tricks, and how I might be dealing with survivor\u0027s guilt.\"\\n\\n \"There you go.\"\\n\\n \"Right—and that explains why I saw a dead man? I still don\u0027t even know who he is—only that the guy who showed up at the right time showed me a picture of him. I\u0027m hungry. Let\u0027s get something to eat.\"\\n\\n \"Nikki, you are going to see the doctor again, right?\" He sighed. \"You need help.\"\\n\\n \"Sure. I\u0027ll see him again. Can we eat?\"\\n\\n A little later, over po\u0027boys at Madame D\u0027Orso\u0027s, Julian said, \"Maybe you should take some time off.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" she demanded, staring at him.\\n\\n \"Well, we actually do ghost tours, no matter what we call them.\"\\n\\n \"We talk about history, and history includes the superstitions and rumors that have sprung up through the years.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but don\u0027t you think that may be bad for you right now?\"\\n\\n \"No!\"\\n\\n He sighed, sitting back. \"Well, you\u0027re on for the eight o\u0027clock tour tonight. You sure you\u0027re up to it?\"\\n\\n \"Of course. Who\u0027s on with me?\"\\n\\n \"Me. We can rotate, you know. I can lead the tour.\"\\n\\n She smiled, shaking her head. \"I\u0027m not going to let the monster who did this to Andrea ruin my life, as well.\"\\n\\n Julian was silent. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-16.html","bookId":2268,"book":{"id":2268,"title":"Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2)","description":"Storyline: Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2) \\n Nikki DuMonde\u0027s newest employee is standing at the end of her bed at four o\u0027clock in the morning begging for help.
