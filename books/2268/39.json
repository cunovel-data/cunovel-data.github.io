Girls! Girls! do you?\" \"You do look a little worn.\" She laughed. He groaned. \"She never sleeps.\" \"I\u0027ll do the talking. You just trail behind, how\u0027s that?\" she asked him. He frowned. \"You\u0027re looking chipper. How is it that you\u0027re so happy when I seriously doubt you\u0027re getting any more sleep than I am?\" She grinned in return. \"It\u0027s just that I\u0027m getting quality sleep,\" she assured him. \"Hey, look. That\u0027s Harold Grant inside again, isn\u0027t it?\" As Julian turned, she studied the man inside Madame\u0027s, buying coffee at the counter. She was surprised to feel a pang of pity for him, and she wondered why. He was a stalwart politician. To the best of her knowledge, he tried to keep his promises. And he hadn\u0027t lost the election. Not yet, anyway. \"He looks tired, too, huh?\" she said to Julian. \"Why not? Billy Banks is yapping right at his heels.\" The man walked out of the coffee shop, two of his aides in tow. Passing their table, he smiled at them absently and hurried on. \"He didn\u0027t even tell us to vote for him,\" Julian said. \"You think it makes all that much difference, who\u0027s in and who\u0027s out?\" Julian shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know that much about politics and local government,\" he said, \"but the guy looks tired. I wouldn\u0027t want the job. I can\u0027t imagine where in the world it would be harder to create a climate of honesty and ethics than here, in the land of Girls! Girls! Girls! People love New Orleans because there\u0027s a sense you can do what you want to do here—short of the obviously illegal, of course. If someone could come in and maintain that, and still wipe out the stuff that comes with it—you know, murder, hard-core drugs, child porn, all that stuff—I\u0027d vote for him in a minute. Maybe that is Harold Grant. And maybe we need Billy Banks, although he seems to me like a Bible-thumper who doesn\u0027t show up in church come Sunday.\" Julian shrugged. \"I\u0027ll probably be voting for old Harold. He looks worn but tough. You know, like a good old bulldog.\" Nikki rose. \"Our customers are starting to arrive.\" \"Where\u0027s lover boy this morning?\" Julian asked. \"Off somewhere.\" \"Good heavens, the romance can\u0027t be over already?\" She smiled. \"We didn\u0027t turn into one person,\" she told him. He inched his sunglasses up. \"No? Just about. It seems as if you don\u0027t need me anymore.\" She kissed his cheek. \"I\u0027ll always need you. You\u0027re my best friend. But… well, looks like you\u0027ve got your barracuda.\" He groaned. \"You\u0027re not going to believe this—and if you repeat it, I\u0027ll call you a liar and wash your mouth out with soap—but I can\u0027t keep up with her.\" Nikki laughed. \"So where is she now?\" \"Back at my place.\" He shook his head. \"Nikki, I may have to move. Hey… maybe I could have to work late tonight, huh? We could have a planning meeting or something.\" \"Hey, I\u0027m not the boss.\" \"Oh, convenient. Push us all around in his absence, then, when I need help, pretend that Max cares.\" \"I think he does care.\" \"Not enough to be here,\" Julian said. \"He knows what\u0027s going on,\" Nikki said. \"He can be generous when he wants. And I\u0027m willing to bet he knows everything that\u0027s happening.\" \"So call him. Tell him we need a planning meeting.\" \"Julian, be a big boy. Tell her that you have a life. Now come on. Those people over there are looking for a tour guide.\" Julian nodded and followed her over to the group that was forming. The most striking thing about Nancy Griffin was her resemblance to Nikki, at least from the back. She was the same height, and she had very similar hair. Her eyes were different, a deep brown, but she was attractive, about the same weight, and she moved in the same easy, naturally sensual way. She met Brent at Café du Monde. He knew who she was the second he saw her coming. \"Mr. Blackhawk?\" she asked, coming over to the table. He had risen. \"Yes, and thanks for meeting me.\" She shrugged. \"The police have basically said that they can\u0027t do anything about it. I\u0027ve already canceled my cards.\" She sighed. \"What I\u0027m really sorry about are the pictures, some of nieces and nephews that I probably can\u0027t replace. One of my sister and me as little kids… well, you know. I lost some cash, but hey, that can be replaced.\" \"They may still find your discarded purse somewhere,\" Brent told her. \"I hope so. Are you some kind of special agent?\" she asked. She flushed slightly. \"The only reason I\u0027m meeting you is that you called me from the police station.\" \"Smart girl. You checked that out?\" \"Caller ID.\" She laughed. \"Luckily, my cell was in my pocket. Anyway—\" She broke off as their impatient waiter came to the table. \"Miss?\" \"Café au lait, please,\" she said. \"No beignets?\" Brent asked. She smiled again. \"I\u0027m on a diet. Eternally. You can gain some mean weight in New Orleans. So… what can I tell you? It was night, and I was pretty much so an idiot. I saw the bum—that police officer did a perfect sketch of him—and a minute later, my purse was gone.\" \"From what I understand, you didn\u0027t actually see the person who lifted your bag.\" She shook her head and thanked the waiter as he delivered her coffee. \"No, I was standing by an alley.\" \"Off Royal?\" \"Yes. I felt a tug, and it was gone. That\u0027s all there is to it. What else can I tell you?\" she asked. \"I\u0027m curious about the rest of your day,\" he told her. \"Before your purse was stolen.\" She frowned. \"Why?\" \"You might have been followed.\" \"Why would anyone follow me?\" Because you look just like someone else, he thought. \"You never know,\" he told her. \"I may not be able to get your pictures or anything else back for you, but… \" He shrugged. \"I can try.\" \"Let\u0027s see… I came here for breakfast. I went to the Civil War museum, and then the new museum on World War II.\" \"Go on. Did you take any tours… go into the cemeteries, anything like that?\" \"Not that day. I came here, went to the museums… and we—my girlfriends and I—were shopping in the French Quarter. It was night by then. Oh, we ate hamburgers that night at a place on the fringe of the old area… lunch was at the hotel. That\u0027s about it.\" \"You weren\u0027t in any of the cemeteries, you\u0027re certain?\" \"I\u0027m certain.\" Brent was disappointed; he had been sure he would find a connection to Nikki, especially once he had seen Nancy. He didn\u0027t show his disappointment. \"I\u0027ll do anything I can to help find your pictures,\" he assured her. \"Thanks,\" she said, and asked, sounding puzzled, \"Are you a cop?\" \"No, I\u0027m with a private agency, and what happened to you may be connected to a few other things going on,\" he told her. \"Ah.\" She lingered with her coffee cup, looking down at it for a minute, then back at him. \"You\u0027re nicer than the cops. They just seemed tired. I guess they get too much of this kind of thing.\" \"Maybe.\" \"Well, feel free to call me if you need anything more.\" \"Thank you.\" He set a bill on the table and rose. She did the same. \"Seriously, feel free to call me any time,\" she told him. He smiled. Not long ago, he might have been happy to pick up on the obvious invitation. \"I will.\" \"You\u0027re not from here, I take it?\" she said. \"Actually, I am.\" \"Are you married?\" she asked bluntly. \"No. But… \" \"Involved,\" she said with a sigh, and smiled, a dimple showing. \"All the good ones are. Ignore me. And thanks. And if you can get those pictures back, great.\" She started to walk away, hesitated, then turned back. \"Actually,\" she said with a frown, \"now that I think about it, we didn\u0027t come here for breakfast that morning. It was another little place. I can\u0027t think of the name of it. But you\u0027d asked me about tours. Tour groups meet there. It was called… \" \"Madame D\u0027Orso\u0027s?\" he suggested. She snapped her fingers. \"That\u0027s it! That\u0027s where we ate. Anyway, good luck.\" With a wave, she was gone. \"Marie Laveau,\" Nikki said, \"has the reputation of being the voodoo queen of New Orleans, though there were those in power before her and those who came after her. Actually, at the end of her life, she returned to being a devout Catholic, and throughout her practice, Marie combined gris-gris with statues of saints. There were those who said she was in league with the devil—Papa Las Bas, as he was known—and there were those who thought that she had divine connections. What she definitely had was an uncanny ability to listen. As she did the hair of the rich, she eavesdropped. She was careful to learn everything she could about everybody. She was definitely a woman who wanted power and knew how to achieve it. \"She died in 1881. We\u0027re here now at her grave. Many people come here now, some with their own beliefs—and others because it\u0027s the thing to do,\" Nikki said, smiling. \"As you can see, there are exes and crosses marked on her grave… and someone left an offering of a po\u0027boy! Interesting. The cemetery insects are going to be very happy. As to Marie\u0027s spirit, many believe that it rises every June 23, St. John\u0027s Eve. They believe that she reigns over a magnificent ritual carried out on that night.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-39.html","bookId":2268,"book":{"id":2268,"title":"Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2)","description":"Storyline: Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2) Nikki DuMonde\u0027s newest employee is standing at the end of her bed at four o\u0027clock in the morning begging for help.
