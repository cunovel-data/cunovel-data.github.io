Huey wasn\u0027t here, and the junkies working the cemetery weren\u0027t coming tonight. He\u0027d had such high hopes. Catch one person involved, and they might begin to unravel the whole mystery.\\n\\n He tried to get himself to think logically. Fact: An undercover FBI agent was dead. The cops knew he\u0027d been onto something, but no one knew what. He\u0027d been working the clubs. He\u0027d met Nikki and Andy in Madame D\u0027Orso\u0027s, and then Andy had died.\\n\\n The exact way. But Andy had once been a junkie, so her death could have been an accident, even though Nikki was certain it had been murder.\\n\\n Fact: Andy was appearing to Nikki.\\n\\n Fact: Tom Garfield was doing the same.\\n\\n Fact: There was a purse snatcher at work in New Orleans. Tom Garfield\u0027s ghost had been witnessed before at least two of the attackers.\\n\\n So where was the key?\\n\\n Back at Madame D\u0027Orso\u0027s? With one of the tour guides?\\n\\n For that matter, where was the elusive Max Dupuis, who owned the tour company?\\n\\n Tomorrow he had to talk to the other woman who had seen the dead FBI agent.\\n\\n Suddenly his introspection was interrupted as something slammed against his thigh. His eyes flew open, and he looked up.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not afraid of ghosts. I\u0027m not afraid of ghosts. I\u0027m not afraid of ghosts,\" Nikki chanted.\\n\\n She had thought she was fine with the idea of seeing ghosts. That she had become accustomed to it.\\n\\n That it was much better to believe in ghosts and her own ability to communicate with them than to believe she was out of her mind and involved with someone who was just as nuts.\\n\\n And she was involved. Deeply. He\u0027d barely come into her life, and suddenly…\\n\\n He was her life.\\n\\n Good God, it wasn\u0027t that serious.\\n\\n Yes, it was. She\u0027d never felt anything like being with him.\\n\\n Every light in the apartment was on, so there was nothing to fear from the shadows, because there weren\u0027t any shadows.\\n\\n She had actually considered going back to bed when Brent had first left. But the mind played tricks. It teased and tormented.\\n\\n So she wasn\u0027t going back to bed. She had no intention of waking from a deep sleep to find Andy was staring at her again.\\n\\n She stayed downstairs, turned on the flat-screen television in the living room, making sure she was tuned to a sitcom, and nothing about forensics, cold cases, haunted America, haunted Europe or even historical tragedy. With the television blaring, she put me water on for tea.\\n\\n Brent wouldn\u0027t be gone that long. He had said so.\\n\\n The teakettle began to whistle. She forced herself to hum loudly as she made the tea.\\n\\n Cup in hand, she returned to the living room.\\n\\n There was an old episode of Cheers on, and she quickly found herself laughing. She just had to keep her mind off…\\n\\n Don\u0027t think. Don\u0027t allow fear to slip in.\\n\\n She was fine. She would be just fine until Brent got back.\\n\\n Then…\\n\\n She felt a prickling sense of unease wash over her, as if it had crept in slowly at first, taking her unaware. The teacup began to rattle in her hands. A deluge of dread began to sweep through her, and with her peripheral vision, she could see…\\n\\n She turned, and her scream lodged in her throat.\\n\\n \"Huey,\" Brent said, shaking his head. The old ghost had given him one good fright.\\n\\n \"Injun boy, you\u0027re late,\" Huey told him.\\n\\n \"I know. Sorry. It was a really busy day.\"\\n\\n Huey shook his head, grinning. \"Don\u0027t matter none. It wasn\u0027t one of those nights. Told ya, I don\u0027t rightly know when they is and when they isn\u0027t gonna be here. But we\u0027re watching the place, the lot of us.\"\\n\\n \"I noticed.\"\\n\\n Huey grinned broadly. \"You noticed nothin\u0027. I crept up on you like as if you was one of them usual fools.\" Huey\u0027s grin deepened then faded. \"Hey, Injun boy, it\u0027s one thing if I creep up on you, but don\u0027t you be so easy when you\u0027re in here again late at night.\"\\n\\n Brent rose, dusting his hands on his pants. \"I promise. You taught me a good lesson.\"\\n\\n \"Go home, boy,\" Huey said. \"They ain\u0027t coming tonight.\"\\n\\n \"All right. But I\u0027ll be back. And I won\u0027t be so late,\" Brent promised.\\n\\n As he headed for the easiest place to jump out, he hesitated, turning back. \"Hey, Huey, have you had any purse snatchers in here lately?\"\\n\\n \"Purse snatchers?\" Huey said. \"Boy, them are drug runners in here now.\"\\n\\n \"Right. But that doesn\u0027t mean a purse snatcher couldn\u0027t come in here, too.\"\\n\\n Huey shook his head. \"Haven\u0027t seen any such thing lately. Maybe out on the streets, but in here… no. There\u0027s always suspicious folks around, some of \u0027em I could swear I see walking around the streets, just like you and me, and them thinking they\u0027re all different, masquerading when they pull off their shit in the cemetery.\"\\n\\n \"Who?\" Brent demanded. \"You have a description for me?\"\\n\\n \"Some cops are good and some ain\u0027t!\"\\n\\n \"Massey? Joulette?\"\\n\\n \"When I know something, I\u0027ll be telling you.\"\\n\\n \"Huey—\"\\n\\n \"When I got something, I\u0027ll tell you. Right now… just a feeling in my bones. Or… well, hell, where I used to have bones.\"\\n\\n \"All right. Thanks, Huey.\"\\n\\n \"You be back here, you hear?\"\\n\\n \"You bet, Huey.\"\\n\\n Brent started back the way that he had come along the streets, where people still wandered, just not as thickly as they did during the day.\\n\\n A saxophone played a sad lament.\\n\\n A drum beat out the rhythm of a rock tune.\\n\\n On the corner, the girl still played her flute, the tune plaintive and beautiful.\\n\\n He started down Nikki\u0027s street. And stopped.\\n\\n He was suddenly certain that he had been followed. He turned around slowly.\\n\\n There were discarded flyers for the contenders in the day\u0027s political debate strewn on the ground. Cleanup crews hadn\u0027t gotten around to picking them up yet. The wind picked up a piece of paper, and cast it back down again. A group of giggling young women went by, talking about the next club they were heading to.\\n\\n No one seemed to be following him.\\n\\n But New Orleans was full of shadows.\\n\\n He started walking again, senses heightened. Had he heard footsteps? Real footsteps, set down by the living?\\n\\n Or…\\n\\n He heard the sound again. The footsteps had been real. He spun around. No one there.\\n\\n The girls had moved on. He was well past the flute player. A middle-aged couple, arm in arm, was coming toward him. They smiled and wished him a pleasant evening.\\n\\n He wished them the same.\\n\\n He had been followed. He was sure of it.\\n\\n He walked back in the same direction he\u0027d come from, cut over a block and kept walking. He listened, waited.\\n\\n But no one was behind him now.\\n\\n Unease filled him. He had been almost back to Nikki\u0027s. Now she was there alone. He quickly turned and headed back toward her place.\\n\\n He began to run.\\n\\n When he reached the old house, he saw that all her lights were on. He quickly opened the gate and hurried to her door. Without bothering with the key, he slammed on the door, hard.\\n\\n \"Nikki! Nikki, it\u0027s me. Brent. I\u0027m back. Let me in!\"\\n\\n For a moment there was nothing. He felt fear cloud his heart. Then the door opened.\\n\\n He let out a sigh of relief when Nikki opened the door. She was in the long flannel robe she had donned before he had left. She stared at him in silence. She was pale, and her eyes seemed far too wide.\\n\\n \"Nikki?\" he said, worried, and he grabbed her shoulders, ready to push past her, determined to meet whatever might have threatened her from within.\\n\\n She touched his face then, quickly. \"I\u0027m all right,\" she told him.\\n\\n \"Then, what… ?\"\\n\\n She caught his hand, clasping it warmly in her own, then taking the time to close and lock the door behind him before she started for the living room.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t alone.\\n\\n There was a beautiful young woman, or the essence of a young woman, seated on the couch.\\n\\n Dark and lovely, she stared at him like a frightened doe.\\n\\n Her hand flew to her throat.\\n\\n She started to rise, started to fade.\\n\\n \"No, no, Andy, don\u0027t go. Please don\u0027t go,\" Nikki said. \"I want to introduce the two of you properly. Brent, this is Andy, Andrea Ciello. Andy, this is Brent, and there\u0027s no reason to be afraid of him. I\u0027ve been telling you all about him.\"\\n\\n Brent\u0027s heart thundered. He stepped forward, offering his hand. He felt the touch of mist. The slightest sensation as Andy offered her hand.\\n\\n She stopped fading and managed a grin for Brent.\\n\\n \"How do you do—wow, Nikki. He\u0027s something,\" she said.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to be afraid of me,\" he said softly.\\n\\n \"Well… \" Nikki said, \"We could all sit down, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"I should leave,\" Andy said quickly, giving them a subtly knowing look.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you dare leave,\" Nikki said.\\n\\n \"Please… you have to tell us what happened,\" Brent said.\\n\\n Andy let out a sigh. \"No, you have to tell me what happened,\" she said firmly.\\n\\n But she sat.\\n\\n And it was evident that she intended to stay.\\n\\n Chapter 16\\n\\n \"You have to believe me,\" Andy told Brent. \"I was a junkie, but I\u0027m not a junkie now. I was a junkie. Well, I\u0027m not anything now, am I?\" she murmured bitterly. \"But I was clean when I was killed.\"\\n\\n Nikki couldn\u0027t believe that she was sitting in her living room, in the dead of night—no pun intended, she told herself—listening to Andy\u0027s ghost try to explain herself to Brent.\\n\\n It was cold, she realized. Ice cold with Andy here. Had she noticed that before?\\n\\n Walking the streets, feeling ghosts, getting a sense of the past… no, she had never realized before that it got icy cold in a room with a ghost.\\n\\n She felt as if she were dreaming, playing a part in some kind of theater of the absurd.\\n\\n At the same time, she was proud of herself.\\n\\n Andy had appeared again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-37.html","bookId":2268,"book":{"id":2268,"title":"Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2)","description":"Storyline: Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2) \\n Nikki DuMonde\u0027s newest employee is standing at the end of her bed at four o\u0027clock in the morning begging for help.
