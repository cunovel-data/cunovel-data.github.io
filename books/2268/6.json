He avoided New Orleans like the plague. Not that he disliked the city. It was full of wonderful people, great food, incredible music.\\n\\n But it was one of the places a man such as himself should never go.\\n\\n \"New Orleans,\" he muttered bitterly. He stared at Adam, shoving his hands into his pockets. \"I\u0027m supposed to be back at the Pine Ridge Reservation on Tuesday,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re needed?\" Adam said.\\n\\n \"Every man is needed,\" Brent told him.\\n\\n Adam smiled, looking away from the area where the festival was taking place, out to the rich areas of saw-grass that seemed to stretch forever, though the road, the Tamiami Trail, was really within a few hundred feet.\\n\\n \"Your eyes are green,\" Adam commented, looking at him again.\\n\\n \"And what is that supposed to mean?\" Brent asked.\\n\\n \"Well, I just listened to you give the most marvelous speech to those children. About acceptance.\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n Adam smiled. \"Heritage is a wonderful thing. The Irish arrived after a potato famine. Italians poured into the country in the 1920s. Cubans and South Americans and immigrants from the Caribbean all came to South Florida. You know what happens after we\u0027re all here a while? We become Americans.\"\\n\\n Brent had to smile. \"And… ?\"\\n\\n \"My point is the one you were just making. We\u0027re all many things. You\u0027re more Irish than you are Lakota. You\u0027re just an American.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So you should support your heritage—all of it. You teach, you counsel… and then you have your special gifts. Your mother was full-blooded Irish, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Is that a comment on my \u0027gift\u0027?\" Brent asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a comment on the fact that you\u0027re a mongrel, like most people. And right now the mixed-up ail-American part of you is needed,\" Adam said.\\n\\n \"In New Orleans?\"\\n\\n Adam looked away for a moment. \"Look, I know how you feel about New Orleans. I wouldn\u0027t ask you if I didn\u0027t believe this was important.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s where Tania died,\" Brent said quietly.\\n\\n \"I know. I said that I wouldn\u0027t have asked you if it weren\u0027t important.\"\\n\\n \"A lot of things are important.\"\\n\\n \"I need you, Brent.\"\\n\\n \"You have other people.\"\\n\\n Adam hesitated. \"You know I always weigh what I need to do very carefully. And in this circumstance, I need you.\"\\n\\n \"I assume you\u0027re going to explain?\"\\n\\n \"The government lost an agent.\"\\n\\n Brent was still puzzled, and he said softly, \"I\u0027m not without sympathy, Adam, but agents put their lives on the line. And sometimes they die.\"\\n\\n \"This agent was seen walking around—after he\u0027d been killed,\" Adam said.\\n\\n Brent arched a brow. \"All right,\" he said after a moment. \"I guess you\u0027re going to tell me all of it?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to tell you everything I know.\" Adam assured him solemnly.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m going to guess that I already have a plane ticket?\"\\n\\n \"You leave tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"The new Storyville district is a great place to visit,\" Nikki assured the crowd around her. \"As in the past, there\u0027s music and great food, but you won\u0027t find the same… business that flourished years ago. Alderman Sydney Story knew he couldn\u0027t get rid of the oldest profession as it\u0027s been called, but he was hoping to control it. I can\u0027t imagine he was happy when the red light district he worked so hard to contain was named Storyville, after him. The district limited prostitution and, in time, other vices to the area from the south side of Customhouse Street to the north side of St. Louis Street, from the lower side of North Basin Street to the lower side of Robertson Street.\"\\n\\n \"There are endless tales to go with the area. The bordellos ranged from the poor and ragged to the rich and classy, the girls from young and green to long in the tooth. But the true reigning queen of Storyville was Josie. She was born just about the end of the Civil War, raised by a very religious family, and seduced at an early age into the arms of a fancy man. But at heart, Josie was an entrepreneur. In her early days, she was red-haired and wild-tempered, and her place was known for some of the fiercest and most entertaining catfights to be seen anywhere. Then, when the brawling became too much even for Josie, she reinvented herself and ran ads for ladies of the highest rank. She managed to make a fortune and buy herself a splendid home in an affluent quarter of the city. Eventually she became obsessed with death. Not that she seemed to be terribly worried about her immortal soul. She was consumed, however, with concern regarding her physical remains. She wanted to be as grand in death as she presumed herself to be in life. So she had a tomb built, a truly magnificent tomb. It incorporated pilasters and urns and torches. And a beautiful sculpture of a woman, one foot on a step, her hand reaching for the door.\\n\\n \"In time Josie died and was entombed. But an heir squandered away her money. Her house was sold, as was her tomb. The new owners did not want her remains, so they were removed. In New Orleans, after a year and a day, that\u0027s no problem. Where they lie today… it\u0027s one of the best-kept secrets of the cemetery. But it\u0027s often said that Josie\u0027s spirit slips into the statue of the woman that still stands at the entry to her former tomb. Is she trying to get into heaven? Or merely beckoning others to follow her? If you happen to see the elegant statue moving, don\u0027t be afraid. Josie had a temper, but she was also a social creature, and it\u0027s said that she\u0027s merely visiting gentlemen callers who happened to have ended their days in the same cemetery.\"\\n\\n \"Where is the tomb?\" a slender woman called to her.\\n\\n \"Metairie. It\u0027s featured on another of our tours, and we hope you\u0027ll join us for it,\" Nikki replied. \"Well, folks, that\u0027s it for the evening, except that my colleagues—the tall, dark handsome fellow there, Julian, and the beautiful young woman to my right, Andrea—will join me in answering any questions you might have. And thank you so much for joining us. There are many tour groups here in New Orleans, so we hope we\u0027ve fulfilled your expectations, and enlightened and entertained you.\"\\n\\n The usual round of questions followed. Nikki never minded, but that night, she knew, she was glancing at her watch. At last she was able to extricate herself from the last family eager to learn more.\\n\\n It had been a good evening. In fact, it had been a good day. Her ridiculous sense of foreboding hadn\u0027t meant a thing. When she finished with the family, she waved to Andy and Julian, and they headed off for Pat O\u0027Brien\u0027s.\\n\\n \"Man, I have never seen so many posters up before an election,\" Julian commented as they passed the wooden barricade around a construction site. The posters advertised the current sensation, an older man named Harold Grant. \"He looks like you, Nikki. Far too serious,\" Julian teased. \"Maybe we need new blood running the place. Have you seen all the posters for what\u0027s-his-name?\"\\n\\n \"Billy Banks,\" Andy reminded him. \"Yeah, and he\u0027s a cutie. Have you seen him, Nikki? Vibrant guy, lots of charisma. Poor old Harold probably doesn\u0027t have a chance against him.\"\\n\\n \"Some people don\u0027t vote for a candidate because he\u0027s cute,\" Nikki said.\\n\\n Julian shrugged. \"They\u0027re both swearing they\u0027re the one who can clean up crime in the parish,\" he said. \"Politicians. Who do you believe?\"\\n\\n \"None of them,\" Andy said.\\n\\n \"Hey… lots of people out tonight,\" Julian said, forgetting politics as they neared their destination.\\n\\n Despite the popularity of the place—an absolute must for tourists—they were able to garner a table. It was almost as if Max could see them in his mind\u0027s eye from wherever he was, because they had just started on their first round of Hurricanes when Nikki\u0027s cell rang.\\n\\n \"Drunk yet?\" Max asked her.\\n\\n \"Funny,\" she told him.\\n\\n A soft chuckle came over the phone. \"Come on, kid. Celebrate. Let yourself go. Drop down among the mortals and do a little sinning, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Who is it?\" Mitch asked, over the din.\\n\\n \"Is it Max?\" Julian demanded.\\n\\n She nodded, pressing the phone closer to her ear and mouthing, \"He wants to know if we\u0027re drunk yet. He\u0027s telling us to celebrate.\"\\n\\n \"Tell him I\u0027m on my way to happily inebriated—since he\u0027s picking up the tab,\" Nathan yelled, slipping an arm around Patricia\u0027s shoulder. \"And Tricia\u0027s doing fine, too.\"\\n\\n \"Hot time tonight, huh?\" Julian asked.\\n\\n Patricia laughed. \"Like he needs to get me drunk at this point.\"\\n\\n \"Just… perky,\" Nathan teased, hugging her.\\n\\n \"Would you guys quit with the sex thing? At least until you see the rest of us coupled up for the night, huh?\" Mitch said. \"By the way, Nikki, make sure you\u0027re hearing Max correctly. He\u0027s telling you to celebrate, not to be celibate.\"\\n\\n \"Funny, Mitch,\" she mouthed.\\n\\n \"What was that Mitch said?\" Max asked. He said something else, but the music was playing and there were voices all around.\\n\\n Nikki waved a hand at them, frowning. \"I can\u0027t hear you, Max,\" she said.\\n\\n The others ignored her.\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t see me coupled up—not in the near future,\" Andy said. \"A voodoo queen warned me to watch out for strangers,\" she assured them.\\n\\n \"Max?\" Nikki said, narrowing her eyes fiercely at the others.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here, Nick,\" he said. \"I just called to say that you\u0027re doing a great job—one of the travel magazines just rated us as the top tour bargain in the Big Easy. So tell Nathan to drink himself silly. And you do the same.\"\\n\\n She realized that the idea actually appealed to her. What had it been? The weird junkie at Madame\u0027s yesterday? That sense of foreboding this morning? The back-to-back tours she had done that day? She needed to take it a little easier. Once Max got back, she was going to tell him that they needed to hire more people. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-6.html","bookId":2268,"book":{"id":2268,"title":"Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2)","description":"Storyline: Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2) \\n Nikki DuMonde\u0027s newest employee is standing at the end of her bed at four o\u0027clock in the morning begging for help.
