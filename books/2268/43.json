He waited until Max and Julian had entered into conversation, then took the moment to catch Nikki\u0027s arm and draw her close as they walked. \"What\u0027s bothering you?\" he demanded.\\n\\n She looked at him, eyes wide. Then she shrugged. \"Oh… a friend died, I think she was murdered, I\u0027m seeing ghosts… conversing with them, actually. And I\u0027m beginning to be glad that I can talk to them. Max is weird, Julian is weirder… and… \" She glanced at him seriously. \"I really don\u0027t know who you are.\"\\n\\n \"You know all you need to know. This has nothing to do with me.\"\\n\\n She smiled. \"You couldn\u0027t care less if Max keeps you on or not, because it isn\u0027t really your job.\"\\n\\n He frowned. \"Nikki, you\u0027re not worried about your job. Max has a gold mine in you, and he knows it. What\u0027s the truth?\"\\n\\n She let out a sigh. \"I don\u0027t know. But… you know how it seemed like someone had been in my apartment? How I just had a feeling? Well, once I started to talk to Andy, I figured it had to be her. But… I just got that feeling in the office, too. If I wasn\u0027t in there, no one should have been. Except for Max, of course, but he hasn\u0027t been here.\"\\n\\n \"Was anything missing?\" Brent asked.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Changed around?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" She flushed. \"But I\u0027m one of those organization freaks. I know exactly how I left the papers on the desk, and they were just a little askew.\"\\n\\n \"Rats?\" he suggested lightly.\\n\\n She frowned at him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll check into it, Nikki.\"\\n\\n \"How?\"\\n\\n \"Trust me. I\u0027ll find a way.\"\\n\\n She studied him seriously. \"You will, won\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n He nodded. She watched him closely then. \"Your turn. Why are you so keyed up and tense?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not.\"\\n\\n She laughed. \"Not usually, but you are now. You\u0027ve glanced at your watch about ten times.\"\\n\\n \"I need to go out at dark.\"\\n\\n She still watched him intently. \"Again?\"\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re not going to tell me where, are you?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"Nikki, even I think I might be on a wild-goose chase tonight.\"\\n\\n \"But why are you so tense?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to leave you alone.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not alone. Julian is desperate to stay with someone he works with, and Max is back now.\"\\n\\n He was silent.\\n\\n She groaned. \"I\u0027ve known Julian all my life. And I keep Max\u0027s business running while he trots all over, doing whatever he wants.\"\\n\\n He let out a soft sigh. \"Nikki, I know you\u0027re going to get angry, but… \"\\n\\n \"But what?\"\\n\\n His clenched his jaw. \"I can\u0027t betray a confidence that may have no bearing whatsoever on what\u0027s happening. But I\u0027m not the only one wondering about your group, okay?\"\\n\\n She stared straight ahead. \"I\u0027ll go home alone then.\"\\n\\n \"But—\"\\n\\n \"I was afraid because of Andy. But I\u0027m not afraid of her anymore.\"\\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t go. I should just let the cops—\"\\n\\n \"No!\" she said sharply, her beautiful eyes full of resolve. \"I want you to go, to do what you have to. Do you understand? I\u0027m comfortable in my own home. I\u0027m kind of hoping for a visit from Andy.\"\\n\\n His eyes narrowed. \"Nikki… you\u0027re up to something.\"\\n\\n \"Shh,\" Nikki said.\\n\\n Their path through the Quarter had taken them past Madame\u0027s. The woman was outside with her coffeepot and stopped dead when she saw Max, smiling. \"As I live and breathe. The master is returned from parts unknown.\"\\n\\n \"Hi, Madame,\" Max said, planting a kiss on the woman\u0027s cheek.\\n\\n She smiled, patted his face and said, \"Looks as if you\u0027ve been roughhousing a bit.\" She glanced at the others. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"Brent tried to beat him up,\" Julian said lightly.\\n\\n Max laughed. \"Do I really look beat up? How embarrassing.\"\\n\\n \"No, there\u0027s just a smudge of dirt on your chin,\" Madame said.\\n\\n Max looked at the others. \"Thanks for telling me, guys.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t see it, honestly,\" Nikki said.\\n\\n \"Why did you try to beat up Max, dear?\" Madame asked Brent. She turned to Max before Brent even had a chance to answer. \"You could fire him, you know.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027d care. Besides, I hear nobody does a cemetery tour like this guy. He\u0027s as familiar with them as Nikki is. Maybe he slides into the tombs at night and gets to know the ghosts, huh?\" Max teased.\\n\\n \"There are no such things as ghosts,\" Madame said with a wave of her hand.\\n\\n Madame\u0027s buxom figure had been blocking the table directly behind her. A familiar voice suddenly sounded from around her derriere. \"Ah, Madame, you are mistaken. Many things exist that we don\u0027t see.\"\\n\\n Contessa rose, having finished her coffee. Her marble eyes touched Nikki with warmth and concern. She spoke very seriously. \"But spirits are seldom evil. The cemeteries, when they are locked down and it is deep and dark and mists rise… they are safe, sad places. But when they are used by the living, that\u0027s when evil reigns.\"\\n\\n \"Contessa,\" Madame said with a laugh. \"You\u0027re good, you\u0027re really good. No wonder I send people to your shop all the time. And, of course, you send your customers to me.\" She looked back to Max. \"Well, have you come for café au lait? In celebration of your return, I\u0027ll bring it out for you, on the house.\"\\n\\n \"Very kind, Madame,\" Julian said. \"But Max is buying—and we\u0027re going to find a different kind of spirit, if you know what I mean.\"\\n\\n \"Sure you don\u0027t want coffee?\" Max asked.\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re not going all cheap on us. Alcohol,\" Julian insisted.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re heading out, I guess, but thanks for the offer, Madame,\" Nikki said. She smiled warmly at both Madame and Contessa.\\n\\n Contessa stared at Nikki oddly. \"Cemeteries are no place for the living at night,\" she murmured, then walked away.\\n\\n \"Strange lady, even for New Orleans,\" Madame said.\\n\\n \"Well, we\u0027ll see you later,\" Max said, and they started walking again.\\n\\n Once again Brent made a point of lagging behind with Nikki. \"Out with it, what the hell is going on? And why did Contessa say that to you?\"\\n\\n \"No reason.\"\\n\\n \"Nikki, don\u0027t be an idiot.\"\\n\\n She hesitated, eyes searching his, apparently deep in a mental dilemma. Then she blurted, \"I\u0027m going to the cemetery tonight. I saw Tom Garfield today, and I think he said I should come there tonight. He tried to talk to me, but I couldn\u0027t hear the rest of what he said. I believe he knows something about what happened to him—about what happened to Andy. I have to go.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Brent nearly shouted, he was so astounded. She\u0027d planned on him leaving, because she meant to head to the cemetery herself.\\n\\n \"Are you insane? Do you know how dangerous going there is under the best of circumstances? You weren\u0027t going to tell me about this? And you saw Garfield? You talked to him? Nikki, you swore you\u0027d tell me—\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t exactly had a chance, have I?\"\\n\\n \"You were going to go to the cemetery alone?\"\\n\\n \"I just meant to see what was happening. Don\u0027t you understand? For some reason he trusts me. I have to find out what he was trying to say, what he was trying to tell me. He doesn\u0027t trust anyone else. I didn\u0027t have any intention of becoming a one-woman assault team. I wasn\u0027t going to attack anyone. I was just going to be there, hidden. Max was right I do know where to hide in that cemetery. I\u0027m willing to bet I know it better than you do.\"\\n\\n He started to answer her, still furious that she hadn\u0027t realized her own personal danger, men bit his tongue.\\n\\n Julian and Max had paused, waiting for them to catch up. Max was assessing him anew, Brent realized, which meant that Julian had probably been describing his relationship with Nikki.\\n\\n \"Something wrong?\" Julian called sharply, sounding like a wary older brother.\\n\\n \"No, we\u0027re with you,\" Nikki called, and sounded perfectly casual.\\n\\n She looked at Brent. It was a very regal look. She simply didn\u0027t intend to be frightened, victimized or dismissed. She intended to fight.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll talk later,\" Brent said beneath his breath.\\n\\n She gazed at him, judging the distance between themselves and Max and Julian. She smiled as she walked, but her words were biting. \"And where were you going? The cemetery?\"\\n\\n \"The cops are going to be there, Nikki. You don\u0027t have to be.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I do.\"\\n\\n \"No. Nikki, dammit, I\u0027m trying to keep you safe.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to sit around and wait. I saw Tom, and he\u0027s trying to tell me something. And I\u0027m not waiting. I\u0027m not going to be like Andy.\"\\n\\n \"Nikki, you can\u0027t be there.\"\\n\\n She glanced his way sharply. \"You need me there.\"\\n\\n \"Nikki—\"\\n\\n \"Dammit, you need me there. I\u0027m the one Tom Garfield trusts, remember?\" And with that, she hurried on ahead of him, smiling as she linked arms with Julian.\\n\\n Chapter 18\\n\\n Nikki was startled when Brent suddenly declined to join their group.\\n\\n He was really angry, and he had no right. She really hadn\u0027t had a chance to tell him that Tom Garfield had appeared again.\\n\\n She herself felt furious at being afraid, at feeling she was a target, that someone might come after her.\\n\\n But before Brent took off, he looked at her and said, \"I\u0027ll pick you up just before eight, okay?\"\\n\\n So she nodded and listened as he told Max that it had been a pleasure to meet him, sorry about the way it had happened, he would get his work papers taken care of, thanks for the drink offer, but he had a few things to attend to.\\n\\n Then he was gone.\\n\\n But his eyes touched hers before he left, more eloquent than any words. I\u0027ll come for you. Be there. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2/page-43.html","bookId":2268,"book":{"id":2268,"title":"Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2)","description":"Storyline: Ghost Walk (Harrison Investigation #2) \\n Nikki DuMonde\u0027s newest employee is standing at the end of her bed at four o\u0027clock in the morning begging for help.
