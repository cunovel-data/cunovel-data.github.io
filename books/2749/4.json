There was seemingly abandoned gardener\u0027s shed on an estate in Scotland, an apartment with a view of Big Ben, a cottage in Wales, and something that could best be described as a small castle, which came complete with a suit of armor and a peacock. Every morning we would drive. Every second there were guards. Sure, you might think that full access to that many covert strongholds would have made Bex and me the envy of the entire student body; but as a rule, we Gallagher Girls don\u0027t envy anything that involves guards (when you\u0027re the guardee) and spiders (and MI6 safe houses have a lot of spiders.) On the sixth night I woke in a narrow bed to the peaceful sound of Bex\u0027s breathing and something else - a muffled word: \"Caven.\" For a moment, I lay there, then I slipped out of the lower bunk. The floorboards were surprisingly quiet beneath my feet. It was freezing, but I didn\u0027t stop to rummage through the duffel bags and suitcases that sat open but neatly packed, ready for a quick escape. Instead, I walked out to the hall and eased toward the narrow, crooked staircase that led from the second story to the small landing outside the kitchen. Perched on the landed, I could see Mr. Baxter\u0027s legs as he sat at the kitchen table, shifting slightly as he spoke. \"Have you seen Rachel?\" \"Yes,\" a woman said in a hoarse whisper. \"I\u0027m surprised that was possible,\" Mrs. Baxter said. The woman laughed softly. \"Well I wasn\u0027t in the mood to hear that it was impossible.\" \"I see,\" Mrs. Baxter said. \"Grace, how is she?\" the woman asked. \"Fine,\" Mrs. Baxter said. \"Should I go get her?\" \"No.\" I stood in the dark listening, while the wind blew and the castle moaned and the woman said, \"Let the squirt have her sleep.\" There was only one person in the world who ever called me Squirt, so I didn\u0027t think - I just stood, ready to bolt down the narrow stairs toward my aunt Abby. But then an arm was around my waist, and a hand clasped over my mouth. I glanced over my shoulder and saw Bex\u0027s wide eyes gleaming in the dark. She shook her head once, quickly. No, she was telling me. Think. We might not get this chance again. My best friend\u0027s smile was especially mischievous (which believe me, is saying something) as she whispered, \"I have a better idea.\" Three minutes later I was standing on the top floor of the castle, looking at a small wooden box and a less-than-sturdy-rope, listening to my best friend insist, \"You should do it.\" \"Why me?\" I whispered, watching as the ancient box dangled in midair over a dark, empty shaft that disappeared into the cold stone of the castle walls. \"You\u0027re shorter,\" Bex said. (Which I am.) \"And I\u0027m stronger,\" she said. (Which she totally could be.) \"And I\u0027m . . .\" \"Afraid of spiders?\" I guessed. But Bex plowed on, \" . . . still a little deaf from the percussion grenade incident during final week.\" So, yeah, that\u0027s how I ended up in the dumbwaiter. I felt myself descending through the castle walls, lower and lower, while the noises in the kitchen grew louder and clearer. \"Are you sure you don\u0027t want some tea?\" Bex\u0027s father asked. \"No thanks, Abe.\" My aunt\u0027s voice sounded weak - almost frail. \"I haven\u0027t been sleeping all that well, to tell you the truth.\" \"Neither have we,\" Bex\u0027s mother added. The kettle began to whistle. A chair scrapped across the floor. \"How close was it really, Grace?\" Aunt Abby asked. \"Was she in any danger?\" \"Cammie is in contest danger,\" Mrs. Baxter said as the whistling stopped. \"You saw him, Abe?\" Abby asked. Even though there wasn\u0027t a doubt who he was, it seemed to take forever for Mr. Baxter to answer. \"Yes.\" \"How was he?\" Abby asked. \"Desperate,\" Bex\u0027s father answered. \"Do you believe it?\" Abby asked. \"This is the way the Circle has worked for more than a hundred years . . .\" Mr. Baxter started. \"But, Abe, we knew him,\" Abby pressed again. After another long pause, Mr. Baxter said, \"I believe Joe Solomon is the sort of man that no one will ever truly know.\" Three seasoned and decorated operatives sat on the other side of the wall. Between them they\u0027d probably mastered a hundred identities in a dozen countries. Names were just covers. Just legends. Hanging in the darkness, I wondered if anything about Joe Solomon was ever real at all. It felt as if the truth were slipping away from me, falling, until . . . Wait, I realized too late, I was slipping - literally. Through a crack in the top of the dumbwaiter, I could see Bex holding the fraying rope, trying hard to pull me back up, but the rope slipped again. Outside, the adults kept talking. I heard Mrs. Baxter saying, \"We can\u0027t tell Cammie until we\u0027re absolutely certain . . .\" \"We can never tell Cammie,\" Aunt Abby said. \"Hold on!\" Bex\u0027s frantic whisper echoed down the shaft as the dumbwaiter dipped again. This is not good, I told myself. This is not . . . But outside the shaft, Mrs. Baxter\u0027s voice was calm. \"She\u0027s almost seventeen, Abby. And the more she knows, the safer she\u0027ll -\" \"Cammie will never be safe!\" Abby said, and I remembered that a semi-stable dumbwaiter was the least of my problems. \"Hang on, Cam,\" Bex whispered from above. \"I\u0027m -\" \"We don\u0027t know that Cammie would do something foolish,\" Mrs. Baxter went on. \"Of course she would,\" Aunt Abby laughed. \"I would. Trust me, Grace, Abe. Cammie can never know -\" Before she could finish, I felt the bottom of the dumbwaiter dropping out from under me as, ten feet up the shaft, the old rope broke and I went hurling toward the kitchen floor. \"What the -\" Mr. Baxter started to yell. With a groan, I rolled over and found myself staring at a pair of gorgeous high-heeled boots, long legs, and a familiar face looking down at me, saying, \"Hey, Squirt.\" Chapter Seven \"Cammie can never know what?\" I asked. Bex was sitting beside me, the two of us in the hard, straight-backed chairs, looking up at her parents and my Aunt Abby. Bex\u0027s hands were rope burned. My elbow was bleeding. But my only concern was what had brought my mother\u0027s only sister to England and, most important . . . \"Cammie can never know what?\" \"See?\" Abby said, gesturing at the two of us. \"This is exactly what I\u0027m talking about.\" \"It\u0027s true.\" Mr. Baxter crossed his arms and eyed us both. His voice wasn\u0027t even a little bit playful as he finished, \"They are a liability.\" \"What cant Cammie know?\" Bex asked, choosing, I guess, to let the liability thing slide for the time being. \"Go to bed, Cammie,\" my aunt ordered, sounding exactly like my mother. \"No,\" I said, sounding exactly like my aunt. I was pretty sure there was about to be a hole in the space time continuum, when Abby snapped, \"Cameron!\" I was already on my feet. \"So you know what you would do if you were me, and you knew this big secret . . .\" I leaned across the table, almost daring her as I finished, \"Now, imagine what you\u0027d do if there was something you didn\u0027t know.\" As threats go, it was a good one. I could see it in Abby\u0027s eyes. After a moment, she pulled out the chair on the other side of the table and sank into it. I tried not notice the stiffness in the movement or the way she held one arm carefully by her side. I tried not to think about the fact that she\u0027d almost died. She\u0027d almost died. She\u0027d almost died. \"We caught one of them.\" Abby\u0027s voice brought me back. \"Election night . . . you were out, and I was . . .\" She trailed off. She\u0027d almost died. \"From the grab team that came for you, we caught one.\" My aunt gestured to the place where she\u0027d been shot. \"We caught the one who did this. A week ago he decided to start talking.\" Beside me, I felt Bex shaking, her impatience coming to a boil. \"What\u0027s this have to do with Mr. Solomon?\" Her father warned, \"Rebecca,\" and Abby carried on. \"The Circle works in cells - small, isolated groups. Two Circle operatives could be sitting right beside each other and not know it. So the man in custody has some knowledge of cell operatives, but he doesn\u0027t know much. He doesn\u0027t even know why they want you, Cammie.\" She looked right at me, and I felt my heart fall. \"He only knows the people he\u0027s worked directly with and . . .\" As my aunt trailed off, I saw Mrs. Baxter tense. Mr. Baxter brought his hand to his mouth as if he couldn\u0027t bear to say the words aloud. \"And he knows the people he was recruited with,\" Abby said slowly. Her gaze fell to the floor. \"When he was Blackthorn.\" For days I\u0027d wanted answers - I\u0027d begged and pleaded for the truth. But now we were there and I didn\u0027t want to hear it. \"No. That\u0027s just what MI6 thinks, for some reason, but they\u0027re wrong. There\u0027s been some kind of mistake.\" I tried to push away, but Abby leaned closer. \"Joe\u0027s a double agent, Cam. He was recruited by the Circle a really long time ago.\" \"How could you say that?\" I snapped back. \"He\u0027s your friend.\" \"He was also friends with the man who did this!\" she yelled, pointing to her injured shoulder. She looked so angry and betrayed, and when she spoke again her voice was more like a plea. \"We have to believe it, Cammie. You of all people need to believe it.\" \"But . . . he was CIA . . .\" It sounded childish, and yet I had to say it. I was, after all, still a child. \"He was our teacher. He couldn\u0027t have been working for the Circle.\" Mrs. Baxter was calm as she took the seat next to Abby. \"Think about it, girls. You know having operatives deep inside the Agency would be a high priority for the Circle. And an operative at the Gallagher Academy - an operative with so much access to Cammie . . .\" \"You\u0027re wrong,\" Bex said. \"It\u0027s an old and effective practice,\" Mrs. Baxter said softly. \"Recruit operatives who are young, encourage them to spend their breaks training with the Circle, working with the Circle. And then send them back to school.\" She was so poised - so good and wise and beautiful that it was almost impossible to doubt her as she looked at us both and said, \"But make no mistake, girls. We know what Joe Solomon did over his summer vacation.\" \"What if he\u0027s changed?\" Bex challenged. \"People change. Maybe he\u0027s not working with them anymore.\" \"It\u0027s not the Boy Scouts,\" Abby answered. \"It\u0027s not that easy to just walk away.\" We sat in silence for a long time before I finally turned back to my Aunt Abby. \"Why did you come here tonight?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/only-the-good-spy-young-gallagher-girls-4/page-4.html","bookId":2749,"book":{"id":2749,"title":"Only the Good Spy Young (Gallagher Girls #4)","description":"Storyline: Only the Good Spy Young (Gallagher Girls #4) When Cammie Morgan enrolled at the Gallagher Academy, she knew she was preparing for the dangerous life of a spy.
