Wake up.\"\\n\\n Chapter Thirty-Four\\n\\n There are many ways a self respecting (not to mention sane) teenage girl might react to having a teenage boy suddenly appear in her bedroom in the middle of the night.\\n\\n Hit.\\n\\n Panic.\\n\\n Flail.\\n\\n Freeze.\\n\\n But I didn\u0027t do any of them. Not right then, because I was lying tangled in the sheets and Zach\u0027s arms. Tears streamed down my face as I thought of my father and Mr. Solomon and Gilly - for a split second I knew what it felt like to be Gilly.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay, Gallagher Girl.\" He smoothed my hair. \"It was just a bad -\"\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" I whispered.\\n\\n Two feet away, Liz shivered and rolled over. In the corner, Bex was starting to snore.\\n\\n Macey lay perfectly still on her back, her dark hair splayed across her pillow like Sleeping Beauty. I jerked my head in their direction.\\n\\n \"Tell me why I shouldn\u0027t wake them?\" I whispered. \"Tell me why I shouldn\u0027t push that?\"\\n\\n I pointed to the panic button on the wall.\\n\\n He smiled. \"Now, where would be the fun in that?\"\\n\\n \"Zach,\" I hissed, and let my hand creep closer to the button.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" he said, reaching out to gently take that very hand. \"I\u0027m here because we need to take a walk.\"\\n\\n When we were in the tenth grade, Zach went to my school for an entire semester. We\u0027d shared the hall as classmates. As equals. But walking into Madame Dabney\u0027s empty tearoom, the playful look he\u0027d had in his eyes that semester was completely gone. I\u0027m not sure what kind of look I had in my eyes, because I totally avoiding my own reflection in the gilt-framed mirrors. (Now was not the time to be worried about pillow-cheek wrinkles and middle-of-the-night crazy hair.) instead, I studied him.\\n\\n \"Do I want to know how you got in here?\" I asked.\\n\\n He shook his head. \"I only broke a few laws.\" He held his fingers a half inch apart. \"Little ones\"\\n\\n Dim chandeliers hung from an ornate ceiling. Our feet were quiet against the polished parquet floors. Almost a year ago we\u0027d stood in this very spot while Madame Dabney ordered us to dance, but Zach didn\u0027t reach for me this time. I didn\u0027t feel like swaying anymore.\\n\\n \"Does the Circle really have him?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Zach\u0027s voice was flat as he ran his hand through his hair and dropped onto one of Madame Dabney\u0027s silk-covered fainting couches. He looked entirely out of place.\\n\\n \"Why? I mean, if he isn\u0027t working with them -\"\\n\\n \"They weren\u0027t exactly doing him a favor. A cozy little CIA prison is probably looking pretty good to him right about now.\"\\n\\n I walked to the tall windows and stared out over the grounds. Zach\u0027s reflection stared back at me in the dark window. Somehow it was easier not to face him.\\n\\n \"People don\u0027t leave the Circle easily, Gallagher Girl.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Anyone who knows how they work or where they work - anyone who knows anything . . .\" As he trailed off, there was something new in his voice. He sounded tired in a way that had nothing to do with the hour.\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re tying up loose ends.\"\\n\\n I tried to focus my eyes on the forest outside, the way the sun was just starting to color the sky. \"Is that what I am?\"\\n\\n Zach stood and moved to my side at the window. Tears stung my eyes, and I kept my gaze on anything but him.\\n\\n \"Gallagher Girl,\" he said softly, reaching for me. \"I don\u0027t know. But I promise we will find out.\"\\n\\n A feeling swept through me when I thought back on the last year: Zach on a train racing through the Pennsylvania countryside; Zach lying beneath the bleachers in Ohio. And finally Zach gripping my hand, leading me away from a white van on a dark street in Washington, D.C. Zach standing between me and an attacker\u0027s gun, the attacker looking at the boy beside me and saying, \"You?\"\\n\\n \"You should be dead, Zach.\" I looked down and saw the way my shadow stretch across the floor between us. \"That night - in D.C. - he had a clear shot. I should be gone and you should be dead.\"\\n\\n \"Gallagher Girl . . .\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t he shoot you?\"\\n\\n \"Everything that night happened so fast, Gallagher Girl.\"\\n\\n \"My name is Cammie!\" I didn\u0027t think about all the people I could have woken, all the alarms that might have gone off. I just snapped, \"How did you know about Boston? Why are you working with Mr. Solomon now? Are you my friend or are you my enemy, Zach?\\n\\n Or, wait, let me guess, you can\u0027t tell me.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why they want you. And for the rest . . . it\u0027s better if you don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n Need-to-know basis is a real thing. It exists for real reasons. But that doesn\u0027t mean I have to like it - and, coming from Zach, it sounded a whole lot different than it did coming from my mother.\\n\\n \"Why do you get to know?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter, Gallagher Girl? Jealous?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I yelled, even though I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027d be kidding. \"I am.\"\\n\\n \"Cammie -\"\\n\\n \"Time\u0027s up, Zach,\" I said. \"Tell me when you know or -\"\\n\\n \"Or what?\" he reached for me. \"You\u0027re not going to hurt me.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t,\" I said, then risked a glance toward the door at the three angriest Gallagher Girls I had ever seen. \"But they might.\"\\n\\n Chapter Thirty-Five\\n\\n PROS AND CONS OF HAVING REALLY CUTE\\n\\n BOYS SNEAK INTO YOUR SCHOOL TO SEE YOU\\n\\n CON: it\u0027s a little creepy.\\n\\n PRO: When someone else sneaks in, you get a lot more sleep than when you have to sneak out.\\n\\n CON: Impromptu visits by boys significantly increase the chance that they\u0027ll see you in your least cute pajamas.\\n\\n PRO: Almost everyone looks good in moonlight.\\n\\n CON: Five hours of very deep sleep is almost guaranteed to do very unfortunate things to your hair.\\n\\n PRO: Waking up in the middle of the night means . . . well . . . waking up.\\n\\n CON: Eventually, whether you like it or not, your roommates are going to find out about it.\\n\\n \"Hello, Zachary,\" Macey said, striding in. \"You\u0027re looking well.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Macey.\" Zach turned to the shortest and blondest of us and tipped an imaginary hat. \"Liz.\" And then finally, he looked back at Bex. \"Rebecca.\"\\n\\n If the use of Bex\u0027s full name was supposed to make her angry, it was entirely too late. She stood by the door, leaning against the frame with her arms crossed. Someone who didn\u0027t know her might have thought she was still tired, but I knew better. She was guarding the exit.\\n\\n \"We were talking about Mr. Solomon, I said.\\n\\n Macey raised her eyebrows. \"Oh, is that what you were doing?\"\\n\\n Bex kept her eyes on Zach. \"What have you heard?\" She asked.\\n\\n Zach shook his head. \"Not much more than you have. The Circle broke him out. The CIA is saying its because he\u0027s with the Circle, but really -\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s because he\u0027s against them,\" Bex finished.\\n\\n Zach nodded. \"In almost two hundred years no one has come closer to bringing down the Circle than Mr. Solomon.\" Zach cut his eyes at me. \"And your dad.\" He waited, as if I might burst into tears or something, but I didn\u0027t. \"The Circle needs to know what Joe knows, and what he\u0027s told others.\"\\n\\n \"Like me?\" I guessed.\\n\\n Zach nodded slowly. \"I\u0027m willing to bet they\u0027re going to have a lot of questions about you.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" Bex said. \"That means they\u0027ll keep him alive.\"\\n\\n I turned back to the window, stood staring out at the shadowy grounds. They need him alive.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to get him back. We have to get him back.\" I felt my roommates looking at me like was crazy, but I turned to Zach. \"Where would they take him?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t lie to me, Zach. Don\u0027t tell me you don\u0027t know things, because you do. Now where would they take him?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know! Do you think I\u0027d be here if I knew?\"\\n\\n I\u0027ve seen Zach in a lot of lights, but in the early morning haze, I saw him as he really was: a scared, parentless boy with absolutely no place to turn.\\n\\n \"What about the man the CIA has in custody - the one who shot Abby?\" Macey asked.\\n\\n \"He might know.\"\\n\\n But Bex was shaking her head. \"He\u0027s compromised. No way the Circle is using anything he ever knew about.\"\\n\\n \"So that\u0027s just . . . it?\" Liz asked. I could see it weighing on her. There were no databases to crack, no satellites to hack into. I thought about Mr. Solomon and his insistence that technology is a crutch, and a real spy should always be able to walk without it.\\n\\n \"Mr. Solomon would know,\" I admitted softly. \"I wish we could ask him.\"\\n\\n The room was quiet in the gray light of early morning. The school still slept. No one was jogging across the grounds. We were alone when Zach whispered, \"Maybe we can.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean there is a second journal?\" Bex asked ten minutes later. She was looking at Zach, and Zach was looking afraid.\\n\\n \"The one Mr. Solomon hid in Sublevel Two was your dad\u0027s Cammie. If anything ever happened . . . it was supposed to go to you. It was your dad\u0027s, so now it\u0027s yours. But Joe kept one too. It goes all the way back to his time with Circle - all the way back to Blackthorne.\"\\n\\n Zach stood at the windows, squinting against the slowly rising sun.\\n\\n \"No one had ever known more about the Circle than Joe. He started writing everything down as soon as they recruited him. And then when he realized what they were, he kept writing because . . . well . . . he knew something like this would happen eventually. He said if I ever needed it, I should go get it.\"\\n\\n \"Go where?\" Macey asked.\\n\\n Zach looked at the four of us for a long time before taking a deep breath. \"Blackthorne.\"\\n\\n I know it will sound crazy. I know you won\u0027t believe me. But I that split second I ran through every scenario I knew - calculated all the odds. It was an informed decision that made me say, \"We\u0027ll go get it - right now. Before everyone is up. \"We\u0027ll -\"\\n\\n \"We?\" Bex cut me off. \"You think we should . . . what? Jump into Liz\u0027s van, drive all night, break into a top secret facility, and, oh yeah, take you away from the safest place in the world?\"\\n\\n \"Think about this, Cam,\" Liz said. \"We don\u0027t have to go anywhere. All we have to do is tell your mom, and she\u0027ll call the CIA and -\"\\n\\n \"My mom\u0027s not here, remember? And you read Dad\u0027s reports - you know the Circle has people at every level of the CIA. Mr. Solomon knew he couldn\u0027t trust just anyone with this, and neither can we.\"\\n\\n Bex shook her head. \"No. It\u0027s too risky.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that risky. We drive up, get the journal, and see if it has any clues about where Mr. Solomon is. It\u0027s not like we\u0027re going to break him out by ours -\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Bex and I snapped at the exact same time, turning to stare at Zach, who was giving us the oddest look.\\n\\n \"Nothing.\" He crossed his arms and shrugged. \"I was just wondering when the two of you switched bodies is all.\"\\n\\n It was true. Bex was not supposed to be the cautious one, the careful one. But then again, a lot of things had changed on that bridge.\\n\\n \"I have to do this for him, Bex. I have to do something.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/only-the-good-spy-young-gallagher-girls-4/page-21.html","bookId":2749,"book":{"id":2749,"title":"Only the Good Spy Young (Gallagher Girls #4)","description":"Storyline: Only the Good Spy Young (Gallagher Girls #4) \\n When Cammie Morgan enrolled at the Gallagher Academy, she knew she was preparing for the dangerous life of a spy.
