{"id":1580,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2 Basil’s Vision","content":"Basil and Decius paced together a garden alley, between a row of quince-trees and a hedge of Christ’s-thorn; at one end was a fountain in a great basin of porphyry, at the other a little temple, very old and built for the worship of Isis, now an oratory under the invocation of the Blessed Mary. The two young men made a singular contrast, for Basil, who was in his twenty-third year, had all the traits of health and vigour: a straight back, lithe limbs, a face looking level on the world, a lustrous eye often touched to ardour, a cheek of the purest carnation, a mouth that told of fine instincts, delicate sensibilities, love of laughter. No less did his costume differ from the student’s huddled garb; his tunic was finely embroidered in many hues, his silken cloak had a great buckle of gold on the shoulder; he wore ornate shoes, and by his waist hung a silver-handled dagger in a sheath of chased bronze. He stepped lightly, as one who asks but the occasion to run and leap. In their intimate talk, he threw an arm over his companion’s neck, a movement graceful as it was affectionate; his voice had a note frank and cordial. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yet Basil was not quite his familiar self today; he talked with less than his natural gaiety, wore a musing look, fell into silences. Now that Aurelia had come, there was no motive for reserve on that subject with Decius, and indeed they conversed of their kinswoman with perfect openness, pitying rather than condemning her, and wondering what would result from her presence under one roof with the rigid Petronilla. Not on Aurelia’s account did Basil droop his head now and then, look about him vacantly, bite his lip, answer a question at hazard, play nervously with his dagger’s hilt. All at once, with an abruptness which moved his companion’s surprise, he made an inquiry, seemingly little relevant to their topic. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Heard you ever of a Gothic princess—a lady of the lineage of Theodoric—still living in Italy?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Never,’ responded Decius, with a puzzled smile. ‘Is there such a one?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I am told so—I heard it by chance. Yet I know not who she can be. Did not the direct line of Theodoric end with Athalaric and his sister Matasuntha, who is now at the Emperor’s court?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘So I believed,’ said Decius, ‘though I have thought but little of the matter.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I too, trust me,’ let fall Basil, with careful carelessness; no actor he. ‘And the vile Theodahad—what descendants did he leave?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘He was a scholar,’ said the other musingly, ‘deep read in Plato.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘None the less a glutton and a murderer and a coward, who did well to give his throat to the butcher as he ran away from his enemies. Children he had, I think—but—’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Basil broke off on a wandering thought. He stood still, knitted his brows, and sniffed the air. At this moment there appeared in the alley a serving man, a young and active fellow of very honest visage, who stood at some yards’ distance until Basil observed him. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘What is it, Felix?’ inquired his master. \\n\\n \\n\\n The attendant stepped forward, and made known that the lord Marcian had even now ridden up to the villa, with two followers, and desired to wait upon Basil. This news brought a joyful light to the eyes of the young noble; he hastened to welcome his friend, the dearest he had. Marcian, a year or two his elder, was less favoured by nature in face and form: tall and vigorous enough of carriage, he showed more bone and sinew than flesh; and his face might have been that of a man worn by much fasting, so deep sunk were the eyes, so jutting the cheek-bones, and so sharp the chin; its cast, too, was that of a fixed and native melancholy. But when he smiled, these features became much more pleasing, and revealed a kindliness of temper such as might win the love of one who knew him well. His dress was plain, and the dust of Campanian roads lay somewhat thick upon him. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘By Bacchus!’ cried his friend, as they embraced each other, ‘fortune is good to me today. Could I have had but one wish granted, it would have been to see Marcian. I thought you still in Rome. What makes you travel? Not in these days solely to visit a friend, I warrant. By Peter and Paul and as many more saints as you can remember, I am glad to hold your hand! What news do you bring?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Little enough,’ answered Marcian, with a shrug of the shoulders. The natural tune of his voice harmonised with his visage, and he spoke as one who feels a scornful impatience with the affairs of men. ‘At Rome, they wrangle about goats’ wool, as is their wont. Anything else? Why, yes; the freedman Chrysanthus glories in an exconsulate. It cost him the trifle of thirty pounds of gold.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Basil laughed contemptuously, half angrily. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘We must look to our honours,’ he exclaimed. ‘If Chrysanthus be exconsul, can you and I be satisfied with less than exPraetorian–Prefect? What will be the price, think you? Has Bessas hung out a tariff yet in the Forum?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘He knows better than to fix a maximum, as long as a wealthy fool remains in the city—though that won’t be much longer, I take it.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Why come you hither, dear my lord?’ urged Basil, with more seriousness. \\n\\n \\n\\n Regarding him with a grave eye, his friend replied in an undertone: \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘To spy upon you.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Ha!—In very truth?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You could wish me a more honourable office,’ Marcian went on, smiling sadly. ‘Yet, if you think of it, in these days, it is some honour to be a traitor to both sides. There has been talk of you in Rome. Nay, who knows how or why! They have nothing to do but talk, and these victories of the Goth have set up such a Greek cackle as was never heard since Helen ran away to Troy,—and, talking of Greek, I bear a letter for you from Heliodora.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Basil, who had been listening gravely, started at this name and uttered an idle laugh. From a wallet hanging at his girdle, Marcian drew forth the missive. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘That may wait,’ said Basil, glancing indifferently at the folded and sealed paper before he hid it away. ‘Having said so much, you must tell me more. Put off that sardonic mask—I know very well what hides beneath it—and look me in the eye. You have surprised some danger?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I heard you spoken of—by one who seldom opens his lips but to ill purpose. It was not difficult for me to wade through the shallows of the man’s mind, and for my friend’s sake to win his base confidence. Needing a spy, and being himself a born traitor, he readily believed me at his beck; in truth he had long marked me, so I found, for a cankered soul who waited but the occasion to advance by infamy. I held the creature in my hand; I turned him over and over, and he, the while, thinking me his greedy slave. And so, usurping the place of some other who would have ambushed you in real enmity, I came hither on his errand.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Marcian,’ said the listener, ‘I could make a guess at that man’s name.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Nay, I doubt if you could, and indeed it matters nothing. Enough that I may do you some little service.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘For which,’ replied Basil, ‘I cannot pay you, since all my love is already yours. And she—Heliodora,’ he added, with a careless gesture, ‘knows of your mission?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Of my mission, no; but of my proposed journey. Though indeed she may know more than I suppose. Who shall say what reaches the ear of Heliodora—?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You have not heard perhaps that her husband is dead?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘The Prefect dead?’ exclaimed Basil. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Three weeks ago.—Rather suddenly—after supper. An indigestion, no doubt.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Marcian spoke with peculiar dryness, averting his eyes from the listener. Upon Basil’s face came a deep flush; he took out the folded paper again, and held it at arm’s length. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You mean—? You think—?’ he stammered. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘About women I think not at all,’ said the other, ‘as you well know. There is talk, talk—what care I?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Basil tore the letter open. It contained a lock of raven-black hair, tied with gold thread, and on the paper was written, in Greek, ‘I am free.’ Again his cheek flushed; he crushed paper and hair together in his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Let us never again speak of her,’ he exclaimed, moving away from the spot. ‘Before I left Rome, I told you that I would gladly see her no more, and you smiled dubiously. Believe me now. I abhor the thought of her. If she ask you for my reply, repeat those words.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Nay, dear my lord, in that I will beg to be excused,’ replied Marcian with his melancholy smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were walking silently, side by side, when the servant Felix again presented himself before them. Maximus, having heard of the arrival of Marcian from Rome, requested that he and Basil would grant him a moment of their leisure. At once the young men turned to obey this summons. On the way, Basil communicated to his friend in a whisper the event of the day. A couple of hours having passed since Aurelia’s coming, the Senator had in some degree recovered from his agitation; he lay now in a room which opened upon the central court of the villa, a room adorned with rich marbles and with wall-paintings which were fading under the hand of time. Deathly pale, scarce able to raise his head from the cushion of the couch, he none the less showed a countenance bright with joyous emotion. His quivering voice strove to welcome the visitor cheerily. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘What news from the city, dear lord Marcian? How are all our friends? Do they begin to forget us?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Not so, Illustrious,’ answered the young man, with head bent. ‘You are much desired in the Senate, where grave counsel is just now greatly in demand.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘The Senate, the Senate,’ murmured Maximus, as if reminded of something he had long forgotten. ‘They must needs lack my voice, I fear. What do men say of the Gothic king?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Marcian threw a glance at Basil, then towards the curtained portals of the room; lastly, his eyes turned upon the sick man, whom he regarded steadily. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘They say much—or little,’ fell from his lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I understand you,’ replied the Senator, with a friendly movement of the head. ‘Here we may speak freely. Does Totila draw near to Rome?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘He is still in Tuscany, and rumours come from his army that he will pass into Samnium. All the strongholds of Umbria are his; all the conquests of Belisarius from Ariminum to Spoletium.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Where are the Roman captains?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Each in his city of the far north, holding the plunder he has got, and looking for the chance of more. In Rome—’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Marcian paused significantly, and the Senator took up his words. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘In Rome rules Bessas.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘The Thracian,’ remarked Basil bitterly. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘And in Ravenna,’ added the sick man, ‘Alexandros—the coin-clipper.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n The eyes of Basil and of Marcian encountered. Between them came no shadow of distrust, the smile they exchanged told of loyal affection. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘This Totila,’ pursued Marcian, ‘seems to be not only a brave and capable commander, but a shrewd politician. Everywhere he spares the people; he takes nothing by force; his soldiers buy at market; he protects the farmer against the taxing Greek. As a result, his army grows; where he passes, he leaves a good report, and before him goes a welcome. At this rate he will soon make all Italy his own. And unless the Patricius returns—’ \\n\\n \\n\\n By this title men were wont to speak of Belisarius. Hearing it, Basil threw up an arm, his eyes flashing. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘The Patricius!’ he exclaimed fervently. ‘There is the man who might have saved us!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘By the holy Laurentius!’ murmured Maximus, looking sadly at his nephew, ‘I have all but come to think as you do.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Who that knew him,’ cried Basil, ‘but must have seen him, in thought—not King, for only the barbarians have kings—but Emperor—Emperor of the West, ruling at Rome as in the days gone by! There lives no man more royal. I have seen him day by day commanding and taking counsel; I have talked with him in his privacy. In the camp before Ravenna there was but one voice, one hope, as to what should follow when the city opened its gates, and the Goths themselves only surrendered because they thought to be ruled by him. But for the scruple of his conscience—and should not that have yielded to the general good?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Is breach of faith so light a thing?’ fell from Marcian, under his breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Nay,’ answered the other, with drooping head, ‘but he did break faith with us. We had his promise; we saw him Emperor—’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You should have won Antonina,’ said Marcian, with a return to his sarcastic humour. ‘She must have mused long and anxiously, weighing the purple against Theodora’s fury. The Patrician’s fidelity stood by his wife’s prudence.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘The one blot upon his noble nature,’ uttered Basil, with a sigh. ‘His one weakness. How,’ he cried scornfully, ‘can the conqueror of half the world bend before such a woman?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Fatigued already by the conversation, Maximus had lain back and closed his eyes. Very soon the two young men received his permission to withdraw, and, as they left the room, the physician entered. Obedient to this counsellor the invalid gave several hours to repose, but midway in the afternoon he again summoned his daughter, with whom he had a long and agitating conversation. He besought Aurelia to cast off her heretical religion, putting before her all the perils to which she exposed herself, by abandonment of the true faith, in this world and the next. His life was hurrying to its end; hour by hour he felt the fever wasting what little strength remained to him; and when he was gone who would protect her against the enmities to which religion and avarice would expose her? Aurelia’s resistance was sullen rather than resolute; her countenance, her words, suggested that she was thinking more of what it would cost her pride to become a penitent than of any obstacle in conscience. At length she declared plainly that never would she humiliate herself before her aunt Petronilla, who had offered her no greeting and held scornfully apart. Here, as Maximus too well knew, lay the great difficulty of the situation; these women hated each other, and their hate would only be exasperated by Aurelia’s conversion. He spoke of the deacon Leander, now on his way hither—begged Aurelia to listen to the reverend man, and gave solemn assurance that, the moment she abjured her errors, he would place her in a position of wealth and authority far above that of Petronilla. So utterly did he exhaust himself in entreaty and argument that he fell into a fainting fit. The physician was called for, and Aurelia, she too overcome with violent emotions, again retired to the part of the villa which had been assigned to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Anicii of a bygone time, who took their solace here when marbles and mosaics, paintings and tapestries, were yet new, would have looked with consternation on halls so crumbling and bare, chambers so ill-appointed, as these in which the guests of the Senator Maximus had their dwelling. Space there was in abundance, but of comfort in the guest-rooms little enough; and despite her brother’s commands, Petronilla had seen to it that Aurelia was not luxuriously lodged. Better accommodation awaited the deacon Leander, whose arrival was announced an hour before sunset by a trotting courier. His journey from Salernum had so wearied the ecclesiastic that he could but give a hand to be kissed by his hostess, and straightway retire into privacy; the repast that was ready for him had to be served beside his couch, and soon after night had fallen, Leander slumbered peacefully. Meanwhile Basil and Decius and their friend from Rome had supped together, making what cheer they might under the circumstances; the Surrentine wine was a little acrid, falling short of its due age, but it sufficed to animate the talk. Presently Decius withdrew, to study or to meditate through some hours of the night, for he slept ill; the others, going apart to a gallery lighted by the full moon, sat wrapped in thick, hooded cloaks, to converse awhile before they slept. With their voices mingled the soft splash of a fountain. \\n\\n \\n\\n Basil was telling of his journey to Cumae, and of the difficulty he had had in persuading Aurelia to visit her father. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Does she live alone there?’ inquired Marcian. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a pause before the reply, and when Basil spoke his voice fell to a note of half-hesitating confidence. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Alone? yes,’ he said, ‘in the sense that no relative abode with her; but she had a companion—a lady—very young.’ And here he again paused, as if in some embarrassment. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘A Roman?’ was Marcian’s next question, carelessly thrown out for he had little interest in Aurelia, and was half occupied with other thoughts. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘No,’ answered Basil, his voice subdued. ‘A Goth; and, she says, of the royal blood, of the line of Theodoric.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n His friend became attentive. ‘A Gothic princess? Whose daughter, then?’ asked Marcian. And Basil, who desired nothing more than to speak on this subject, little by little threw off his hesitancy, grew rapid and eager in narration. He told how, on his first introduction to Aurelia’s presence, he had found sitting with her a young girl, whose aspect proclaimed her of the Gothic race. In a second interview with his cousin, alone, Aurelia had spoken of this companion, bestowing much praise upon her, and declaring that they were united by an affection which nothing could diminish. She was of Amal blood; more than that Aurelia seemed unwilling to reveal. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Did you not learn her name?’ asked the listener. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Veranilda.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Marcian echoed the melodious syllables, but they told him nothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘And did you make no inquiry of those with whom you spoke?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I conversed as little as might be with strangers, and purposely held apart from our acquaintances in the town; this was my uncle’s express command.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You had no second sight of her?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Indeed I had; and talked with her moreover. Marcian, how can I describe her to you? The words which suffice for common beauty sound meaningless when I would use them to depict Veranilda. Shall I tell you that she has hair of the purest gold, eyes brighter than the sky at noon, lips like the flower of the pomegranate, a cheek so fair, so soft—nay, you may well laugh at these idle phrases—’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Not your phrases,’ said Marcian, ‘but your voice as it utters them sets me smiling. Talk on. The chaste goddess who beams above us inspire you with worthy terms!’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘There you speak to the point,’ pursued Basil ardently. ‘For Veranilda is chaste as she is beautiful. Blessed saints! how my heart shrank in abhorrence when I saw that letter this morning; and how fain I would blot from my memory that baseness of the past! O Marcian, truest of friends, I slighted your counsel, scoffed at your warnings, but now I know how wisely and how honestly you spoke.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Be that as it may,’ said the other. ‘But is it possible that, on a mere glimpse, this Gothic maiden should so have vanquished you?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘It had been more prudent to hold my peace. But you know me of old. When I am moved, I must needs unbosom myself; happy that I have one whom I can trust. Her voice, Marcian! This whisper of the night breeze in the laurels falls rudely upon the ear after Veranilda’s speech. Never have I heard a tone so soft, so gentle. The first word she spoke thrilled through me, as never did voice before; and I listened, listened, hoping she would speak again.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Who may she be? Has not the lady Aurelia adorned her origin? Golden hair and blue eyes are no rarity among daughters of the Goths.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Had you seen her!’ exclaimed Basil, and grew rapturous again. Whilst he exhausted language in the effort to prove how remote was Veranilda from any shape of loveliness easily presented by memory or imagination, Marcian pondered. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I can think of but one likelihood,’ was his quiet remark, when his friend had become silent. ‘King Theodahad had a daughter, who married the Gothic captain, Ebrimut.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘The traitor,’ murmured Basil uneasily. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Or friend of the Romans, as you will. He delivered Rhegium to Belisarius, and enjoys his reward at Byzantium. What if he left a child behind him?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Basil repulsed the suggestion vehemently. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Not that! I had half thought of it myself; but no. Aurelia said of the house of Theodoric.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Why so would be a daughter of Ebrimut, through her mother—who was the daughter of Theodahad, who was the son of Amalafrida, who was the sister of Theodoric himself.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘She could not have meant that,’ protested Basil. ‘Child of a mercenary traitor, who opened Italy to his people’s foe! Not that! Had you seen her, you would not believe it.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Oh, my good Basil,’ laughed the other, ‘do you think I should see her with your eyes? But perhaps we conjecture idly quite missing the mark. What does it matter? You have no intention, I hope, of returning to Cumae?’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Basil opened his lips to reply, but thought better of it, and said nothing. Then his friend turned to speak of the ecclesiastical visitor who had that evening arrived, and, the subject not proving very fruitful, each presently betook himself to his night’s repose. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1396/41770.html","bookId":54,"book":{"id":54,"title":"Veranilda","description":"简介： Seven years long had the armies of Justinian warred against the Goths in Italy.
