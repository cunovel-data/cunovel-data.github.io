Though cramped, main control was complex and expensive: it had cost $2,000,000, the most costly single room in the Wildfire installation. But it was vital to the functioning of the entire laboratory.\n Main control served as the first step in scientific examination of the capsule. Its chief function was detection-the room was geared to detect and isolate microorganisms. According to the Life Analysis Protocol, there were three main steps in the Wildfire program: detection, characterization, and control. First the organism had to be found. Then it had to be studied and understood. Only then could ways be sought to control it.\n Main control was set up to find the organism.\n Leavitt and Stone sat side by side in front of the banks of controls and dials. Stone operated the mechanical hands, while Leavitt manipulated the microscopic apparatus. Naturally it was impossible to enter the room with the capsule and examine it directly. Robot-controlled microscopes, with viewing screens in the control room, would accomplish this for them.\n An early question had been whether to utilize television or some kind of direct visual linkup. Television was cheaper and more easily set up; TV image-intensifiers were already in use for electron microscopes, X-ray machines, and other devices. However, the Wildfire group finally decided that a TV screen was too imprecise for their needs; even a double-scan camera, which transmitted twice as many lines as the usual TV and gave better image resolution, would be insufficient. In the end, the group chose a fiber optics system in which a light image was transmitted directly through a snakelike bundle of glass fibers and then displayed on the viewers. This gave a clear, sharp image.\n Stone positioned the capsule and pressed the appropriate controls. A black box moved down from the ceiling and began to scan the capsule surface. The two men watched the viewer screens:\n \"Start with five power,\" Stone said. Leavitt set the controls. They watched as the viewer automatically moved around the capsule, focusing on the surface of the metal. They watched one complete scan, then shifted up to twenty-power magnification. A twenty-power scan took much longer, since the field of view was smaller. They still saw nothing on the surface: no punctures, no indentations, nothing that looked like a small growth of any kind.\n \"Let\u0027s go to one hundred,\" Stone said. Leavitt adjusted the controls and sat back. They were beginning what they knew would be a long and tedious search. Probably they would find nothing. Soon they would examine the interior of the capsule; they might find something there. Or they might not. In either case, they would take samples for analysis, plating out the scrapings and swabs onto growth media.\n Leavitt glanced from the viewing screens to look into the room. The viewer, suspended from the ceiling by a complex arrangement of rods and wires, was automatically moving in slow circles around the capsule. He looked back to the screens.\n There were three screens in main control, and all showed exactly the same field of view. In theory, they could use three viewers projecting onto three screens, and cover the capsule in one third the time. But they did not want to do that-- at least not now. Both, men knew that their interest and attention would fatigue as the day wore on. No matter how hard they tried, they could not remain alert all the time. But if two men watched the same image, there was less chance of missing something.\n The surface area of the cone-shaped capsule, thirty-seven inches long and a foot in diameter at the base, was just over 650 square inches. Three scans, at five, twenty, and one hundred power, took them slightly more than two hours. At the end of the third scan, Stone said, \"I suppose we ought to proceed with the 440 scan as well.\"\n \"But?\"\n \"I am tempted to go directly to a scan of the interior. If we find nothing, we can come back outside and do a 440.\"\n \"I agree.\"\n \"All right,\" Stone said. \"Start with five. On the inside.\"\n Leavitt worked the controls. This time, it could not be done automatically; the viewer was programmed to follow the contours of any regularly shaped object, such as a cube, a sphere, or a cone. But it could not probe the interior of the capsule without direction. Leavitt set the lenses at five diameters and switched the remote viewer to manual control. Then he directed it down into the scoop opening of the capsule.\n Stone, watching the screen, said, \"More light.\"\n Leavitt made adjustments. Five additional remote lights came down from the ceiling and clicked on, shining into the scoop.\n \"Better?\"\n \"Fine.\"\n Watching his own screen, Leavitt began to move the remote viewer. It took several minutes before he could do it smoothly; it was difficult to coordinate, rather like trying to write while you watched in a mirror. But soon he was scanning smoothly.\n The five-power scan took twenty minutes. They found nothing except a small indentation the size of a pencil point. At Stone\u0027s suggestion, when they began the twenty-power scan they started with the indentation.\n Immediately, they saw it: a tiny black fleck of jagged material no larger than a grain of sand. There seemed to be bits of green mixed in with the black.\n Neither man reacted, though Leavitt later recalled that he was \"trembling with excitement. I kept thinking, if this is it, if it\u0027s really something new, some brand new form of life...\"\n However, all he said was, \"Interesting.\"\n \"We\u0027d better complete the scan at twenty power,\" Stone said. He was working to keep his voice calm, but it was clear that he was excited too.\n Leavitt wanted to examine the fleck at higher power immediately, but he understood what Stone was saying. They could not afford to jump to conclusions-- any conclusions. Their only hope was to be grindingly, interminably thorough. They had to proceed methodically, to assure themselves at every point that they had overlooked nothing.\n Otherwise, they could pursue a course of investigation for hours or days, only to find it ended nowhere, that they had made a mistake, misjudged the evidence, and wasted time.\n So Leavitt did a complete scan of the interior at twenty power. He paused, once or twice, when they thought they saw other patches of green, and marked down the coordinates so they could find the areas later, under higher magnification. Half an hour passed before Stone announced he was satisfied with the twenty-power scan.\n They took a break for caffeine, swallowing two pills with water. The team had agreed earlier that amphetamines should not be used except in times of serious emergency; they were stocked in the Level V pharmacy, but for routine purposes caffeine was preferred.\n The aftertaste of the caffeine pill was sour in his mouth as Leavitt clicked in the hundred-power lenses, and began the third scan. As before, they started with the indentation, and the small black fleck they had noted earlier.\n It was disappointing: at higher magnification it appeared no different from their earlier views, only larger. They could see, however, that it was an irregular piece of material, dull, looking like rock. And they could see there were definitely flecks of green mined on the jagged surface of the material.\n \"What do you make of it?\" Stone said.\n \"If that\u0027s the object the capsule collided with,\" Leavitt said, \"it was either moving with great speed, or else it is very heavy. Because it\u0027s not big enough--\"\n \"To knock the satellite out of orbit otherwise. I agree. And yet it did not make a very deep indentation.\"\n \"Suggesting?\"\n Stone shrugged. \"Suggesting that it was either not responsible for the orbital change, or that it has some elastic properties we don\u0027t yet know about.\"\n \"What do you think of the green?\"\n Stone grinned. \"You won\u0027t trap me yet. I am curious, nothing more.\"\n Leavitt chuckled and continued the scan. Both men now felt elated and inwardly certain of their discovery. They checked the other areas where they had noted green, and confirmed the presence of the patches at higher magnification.\n But the other patches looked different from the green on the rock. For one thing, they were larger, and seemed somehow more luminous. For another, the borders of the patches seemed quite regular, and rounded.\n \"Like small drops of green paint, spattered on the inside of the capsule,\" Stone said.\n \"I hope that\u0027s not what it is.\"\n \"We could probe,\" Stone said.\n \"Let\u0027s wait for 440.\"\n Stone agreed. By now they had been scanning the capsule for nearly four hours, but neither man felt tired. They watched closely as the viewing screens blurred for a moment, the lenses shifting. When the screens came back into focus, they were looking at the indentation, and the black fleck with the green areas. At this magnification, the surface irregularities of the rock were striking-- it was like a miniature planet, with jagged peaks and sharp valleys. It occurred to Leavitt that this was exactly what they were looking at: a minute, complete planet, with its life forms intact. But he shook his head, dismissing the thought from his mind. Impossible.\n Stone said, \"If that\u0027s a meteor, it\u0027s damned funny-looking.\"\n \"What bothers you?\"\n \"That left border, over there.\" Stone pointed to the screen. \"The surface of the stone-- if it is stone-- is rough everywhere except on that left border, where it is smooth and rather straight.\"\n \"Like an artificial surface?\"\n Stone sighed. \"If I keep looking at it,\" he said, \"I might start to think so. Let\u0027s see those other patches of green.\"\n Leavitt set the coordinates and focused the viewer. A new image appeared on the screens. This time, it was a close-up of one of the green patches. Under high magnification the borders could be seen clearly. They were not smooth, but slightly notched: they looked almost like a gear from the inside of a watch.\n \"I\u0027ll be damned,\" Leavitt said.\n \"It\u0027s not paint. That notching is too regular.\"\n As they watched, it happened: the green spot turned purple for a fraction of a second, less than the blink of an eye. Then it turned green once more.\n \"Did you see that?\"\n \"I saw it. You didn\u0027t change the lighting?\"\n \"No. Didn\u0027t touch it.\"\n A moment later, it happened again: green, a flash of purple, green again.\n \"Amazing.\"\n \"This may be--\"\n And then, as they watched, the spot turned purple and remained purple. The notches disappeared; the spot had enlarged slightly, filling in the V-shaped gaps. It was now a complete circle. It became green once more.\n \"It\u0027s growing,\" Stone said.\n ***\n They worked swiftly. The movie cameras were brought down, recording from five angles at ninety-six frames per second. Another time-lapse camera clicked off frames at half-second intervals. Leavitt also brought down two more remote cameras, and set them at different angles from the original camera.\n In main control, all three screens displayed different views of the green spot.\n \"Can we get more power? More magnification?\" Stone said.\n \"No. You remember we decided 440 was the top.\"\n Stone swore. To obtain higher magnification, they would have to go to a separate room, or else use the electron microscopes. In either case, it would take time.\n Leavitt said, \"Shall we start culture and isolation?\"\n \"Yes. Might as well.\"\n Leavitt turned the viewers back down to twenty power. They could now see that there were four areas of interest, three isolated green patches, and the rock with its indentation. On the control console, he pressed a button marked CULTURE, and a tray 4t the side of the room slid out, revealing stacks of circular, plastic-covered petri dishes. Inside each dish was a thin layer of growth medium.\n The Wildfire project employed almost every known growth medium. The media were jellied compounds containing various nutrients on which bacteria would feed and multiply. Along with the usual laboratory standbys-- horse and sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, simplex, Sabourad\u0027s medium-- there were thirty diagnostic media, containing various sugars and minerals. Then there were forty-three specialized culture media, including those for growth of tubercule bacilli and unusual fungi, as well as the highly experimental media, designated by numbers: ME-997, ME-423, ME-A12, and so on.\n With the tray of media was a batch of sterile swabs. Using the mechanical hands, Stone picked up the swabs singly and touched them to the capsule surface, then to the media. Leavitt punched data into the computer, so that they would know later where each swab had been taken. In this manner, they swabbed the outer surface of the entire capsule, and went to the interior. Very carefully, using high viewer magnification, Stone took scrapings from the green spots and transferred them to the different media.\n Finally, he used fine forceps to pick up the rock and move it intact to a clean glass dish.\n The whole process took better than two hours. At the end of that time, Leavitt punched through the MAXCULT computer program. This program automatically instructed the machine in the handling of the hundreds of petri dishes they had collected. Some would be stored at room temperature and pressure, with normal earth atmosphere. Others would be subjected to heat and cold; high pressure and vacuum; low oxygen and high oxygen; light and dark. Assigning the plates to the various culture boxes was a job that would take a man days to work out. The computer could do it in seconds.\n When the program was running, Stone placed the stacks of petri dishes on the conveyor belt. They watched as the dishes moved off to the culture boxes.\n There was nothing further they could do, except wait twenty-four to forty-eight hours, to see what grew out.\n \"Meantime,\" Stone said, \"we can begin analysis of this piece of rock-- if it actually is rock. How are you with an EM?\"\n \"Rusty,\" Leavitt said. He had not used an electron microscope for nearly a year.\n \"Then I\u0027ll prepare the specimen. We\u0027ll also want mass spectrometry done. That\u0027s all computerized. But before we do that, we ought to go to higher power. What\u0027s the highest light magnification we can get in Morphology?\"\n \"A thousand diameters.\"\n \"Then let\u0027s do that first. Punch the rock through to Morphology.\"\n Leavitt looked down at the console and pressed MORPHOLOGY. Stone\u0027s mechanical hands placed the glass dish with the rock onto the conveyor belt.\n They looked at the wall clock behind them. It showed 1100 hours; they had been working for eleven straight hours.\n \"So far,\" Stone said, \"so good.\"\n Leavitt grinned, and crossed his fingers.\n 16. Autopsy\n BURTON WAS WORKING IN THE AUTOPSY room. He was nervous and tense, still bothered by his memories of Piedmont. Weeks later, in reviewing his work and his thoughts on Level V, he regretted his inability to concentrate.\n Because in his initial series of experiments, Burton made several mistakes.\n According to the protocol, he was required to carry out autopsies on dead animals, but he was also in charge of preliminary vector experiments. In all fairness, Burton was not the man to do this work; Leavitt would have been better suited to it. But it was felt that Leavitt was more useful working on preliminary isolation and identification.\n So the vector experiments fell to Burton.\n They were reasonably simple and straightforward, designed to answer the question of how the disease was transmitted. Burton began with a series of cages, lined up in a row. Each had a separate air supply; the air supplies could be interconnected in a variety of ways.\n Burton placed the corpse of the dead Norway rat, which was contained in an airtight cage, alongside another cage containing a living rat. He punched buttons; air was allowed to pass freely from one cage to the other.\n The living rat flopped over and died.\n Interesting, he thought. Airborne transmission. He hooked up a second cage with a live rat, but inserted a Millipore filter between the living and dead rat cages. This filter had perforations 100 angstroms in diameter-- the size of a small virus.\n He opened the passage between the two cages. The rat remained alive.\n He watched for several moments, until he was satisfied. Whatever it was that transmitted the disease, it was larger than a virus. He changed the filter, replacing it with a larger one, and then another still larger. He continued in this way until the rat died.\n The filter had allowed the agent to pass. He checked it: two microns in diameter, roughly the size of a small cell. He thought to himself that he had just learned something very valuable indeed: the size of the infectious agent.\n This was important, for in a single simple experiment he had ruled out the possibility that a protein or a chemical molecule of some kind was doing the damage. At Piedmont, he and Stone had been concerned about a gas, perhaps a gas released as waste from the living organism.\n Yet, clearly, no gas was responsible. The disease was transmitted by something the size of a cell that was very much bigger than a molecule, or gas droplet.\n The next step was equally simple-- to determine whether dead animals were potentially infectious.\n He took one of the dead rats and pumped the air out of its cage. He waited until the air was fully evacuated. In the pressure fall, the rat ruptured, bursting open. Burton ignored this.\n When he was sure all air was removed, he replaced the air with fresh, clean, filtered air. Then he connected the cage to the cage of a living animal.\n Nothing happened.\n Interesting, he thought. Using a remotely controlled scalpel, he sliced open the dead animal further, to make sure any organisms contained inside the carcass would be released into the atmosphere.\n Nothing happened. The live rat scampered about its cage happily.\n The results were quite clear: dead animals were not infectious. That was why, he thought, the buzzards could chew at the Piedmont victims and not die. Corpses could not transmit the disease; only the bugs themselves, carried in the air, could do so.\n Bugs in the air were deadly.\n Bugs in the corpse were harmless.\n In a sense, this was predictable. It had to do with theories of accommodation and mutual adaptation between bacteria and man. Burton had long been interested in this problem, and had lectured on it at the Baylor Medical School.\n Most people, when they thought of bacteria, thought of diseases. Yet the fact was that only 3 percent of them produced human disease; the rest were either harmless or beneficial. In the human gut, for instance, there were a variety of bacteria that were helpful to the digestive process. Man needed them, and relied upon them.\n In fact, man lived in a sea of bacteria. They were everywhere-- on his skin, in his ears and mouth, down his lungs, in his stomach. Everything he owned, anything he touched, every breath he breathed, was drenched in bacteria. Bacteria were ubiquitous. Most of the time you weren\u0027t aware of it.\n And there was a reason. Both man and bacteria had gotten used to each other, had developed a kind of mutual immunity. Each adapted to the other.\n And this, in turn, for a very good reason. It was a principle of biology that evolution was directed toward increased reproductive potential. A man easily killed by bacteria was poorly adapted; he didn\u0027t live long enough to reproduce.\n A bacteria that killed its host was also poorly adapted. Because any parasite that kills its host is a failure. It must die when the host dies. The successful parasites were those that could live off the host without killing him.\n And the most successful hosts were those that could tolerate the parasite, or even turn it to advantage, to make it work for the host.\n \"The best adapted bacteria,\" Burton used to say, \"are the ones that cause minor diseases, or none at all. You may carry the same single cell of Strep. viridians on your body for sixty or seventy years. During that time, you are growing and reproducing happily; so is the Strep. You can carry Staph. aureus around, and pay only the price of some acne and pimples. You can carry tuberculosis for many decades; you can carry syphilis for a lifetime. These last are not minor diseases, but they are much less severe than they once were, because both man and organism have adapted.\"\n It was known, for instance, that syphilis had been a virulent disease four hundred years before, producing huge festering sores all over the body, often killing in weeks. But over the centuries, man and the spirochete had learned to tolerate each other.\n Such considerations were not so abstract and academic as they seemed at first. In the early planning of Wildfire, Stone had observed that 40 per cent of all human disease was caused by microorganisms. Burton had countered by noting that only 3 per cent of all microorganisms caused disease. Obviously, while much human misery was attributable to bacteria, the chances of any particular bacteria being dangerous to man were very small. This was because the process of adaptation-- of fitting man to bacteria-- was complex.\n \"Most bacteria,\" Burton observed, \"simply can\u0027t live within a man long enough to harm him. Conditions are, one way or another, unfavorable. The body is too hot or too cold, too acid or too alkaline, there is too much oxygen or not enough. Man\u0027s body is as hostile as Antarctica to most bacteria.\"\n This meant that the chances of an organism from outer space being suited to harm man were very slim. Everyone recognized this, but felt that Wildfire had to be constructed in any event. Burton certainly agreed, but felt in an odd way that his prophecy had come true.\n Clearly, the bug they had found could kill men. But it was not really adapted to men, because it killed and died within the organism. It could not be transmitted from corpse to corpse. It existed for a second or two in its host, and then died with it.\n Satisfying intellectually, he thought.\n But practically speaking they still had to isolate it, understand it, and find a cure.\n ***\n Burton already knew something about transmission, and something about the mechanism of death: clotting of the blood. The question remained-- How did the organisms get into the body?\n Because transmission appeared to be airborne, contact with skin and lungs seemed likely. Possibly the organisms burrowed right through the skin surface. Or they might be inhaled. Or both.\n How to determine it?\n He considered putting protective suitings around an experimental animal to cover all but the mouth. That was possible, but it would take a long time. He sat and worried about the problem for an hour.\n Then he hit upon a more likely approach.\n He knew that the organism killed by clotting blood. Very likely it would initiate clotting at the point of entrance into the body. If skin, clotting would start near the surface. If lungs, it would begin in the chest, radiating outward.\n This was something he could test. By using radioactively tagged blood proteins, and then following his animals with scintillometer scans, he could determine where in the body the blood first clotted.\n He prepared a suitable animal, choosing a rhesus monkey because its anatomy was more human than a rat\u0027s. He infused the radioactive tagging substance, a magnesium isotope, into the monkey and calibrated the scanner. After allowing equilibration, he tied the monkey down and positioned the scanner overhead.\n He was now ready to begin.\n The scanner would print out its results on a series of human block outlines. He set the computer printing program and then exposed the rhesus to air containing the lethal microorganism.\n Immediately, the printout began to clatter out from the computer:\n [graphic of disease spread in human body]\n It was all over in three seconds. The graphic printout told him what he needed to know, that clotting began in the lungs and spread outward through the rest of the body.\n But there was an additional piece of information gained. Burton later said, \"I had been concerned that perhaps death and clotting did not coincide-- or at least did not coincide exactly. It seemed impossible to me that death could occur in three seconds, but it seemed even more unlikely that the total blood volume of the body-five quarts-could solidify in so short a period. I was curious to know whether a single crucial clot might form, in the brain, perhaps, and the rest of the body clot at a slower pace.\"\n Burton was thinking of the brain even at this early stage of his investigation. In retrospect, it is frustrating that he did not follow this line of inquiry to its logical conclusion. He was prevented from doing this by the evidence of the scans, which told him that clotting began in the lungs and progressed up the carotid arteries to the brain one or two seconds later.\n So Burton lost immediate interest in the brain. And his mistake was compounded by his next experiment.\n ***\n It was a simple test, not part of the regular Wildfire Protocol. Burton knew that death coincided with blood clotting. If clotting could be prevented, could death be avoided?\n He took several rats and injected them with heparin, an anticoagulating drug-- preventing blood-clot formation. Heparin was a rapid-acting drug widely used in medicine; its actions were thoroughly understood. Burton injected the drug intravenously in varying amounts, ranging from a low-normal dose to a massively excessive dose.\n Then he exposed the rats to air containing the lethal organism.\n The first rat, with a low dose, died in five seconds. The others followed within a minute. A single rat with a massive dose lived nearly three minutes, but he also succumbed in the end.\n Burton was depressed by the results. Although death was delayed, it was not prevented. The method of symptomatic treatment did not work.\n He put the dead rats to one side, and then made his crucial mistake. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-andromeda-strain/page-14.html","bookId":1577,"book":{"id":1577,"title":"The Andromeda Strain","description":"Storyline: \n The United States government is given a warning by the pre-eminent biophysicists in the country: current sterilization procedures applied to returning space probes may be inadequate to guarantee uncontaminated re-entry to the atmosphere. \n Two years later, seventeen satellites are sent into the outerfringes of space to \"collect organisms and dust for study.\" One of them falls to earth, landing in a desolate area of Arizona. \n Twelve miles from the landing site, in the town of Piedmont, a shocking discovery is made: the streets are littered with the dead bodies of the town\u0027s inhabitants, as if they dropped dead in their tracks.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-andromeda-strain.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-andromeda-strain.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:53 PM"}}
