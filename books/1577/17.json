The wall clock told him it was now 1500 hours-- three in the afternoon. He suddenly realized he was tired. He punched in instructions to the computer to wake him when analysis was finished. Then he went off to bed. *** In another room, Leavitt was carefully feeding similar chips into a different machine, an amino-acid analyzer. As he did so, he smiled slightly to himself, for he could remember how it had been in the old days, before AA analysis was automatic. In the early fifties, the analysis of amino acids in a protein might take weeks, or even months. Sometimes it took years. Now it took hours-- or at the very most, a day-- and it was fully automatic. Amino acids were the building blocks of proteins. There were twenty-four known amino acids, each composed of a half-dozen molecules of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. Proteins were made by stringing these amino acids together in a line, like a freight train. The order of stringing determined the nature of the protein-- whether it was insulin, hemoglobin, or growth hormone. All proteins were composed of the same freight cars, the same units. Some proteins had more of one kind of car than another, or in a different order. But that was the only difference. The same amino acids, the same freight cars, existed in human proteins and flea proteins. That fact had taken approximately twenty years to discover. But what controlled the order of amino acids in the protein? The answer turned out to be DNA, the genetic-coding substance, which acted like a switching manager in a freightyard. That particular fact had taken another twenty years to discover. But then once the amino acids were strung together, they began to twist and coil upon themselves; the analogy became closer to a snake than a train. The manner of coiling was determined by the order of acids, and was quite specific: a protein had to be coiled in a certain way, and no other, or it failed to function. Another ten years. Rather odd, Leavitt thought. Hundreds of laboratories, thousands of workers throughout the world, all bent on discovering such essentially simple facts. It had all taken years and years, decades of patient effort. And now there was this machine. The machine would not, of course, give the precise order of amino acids. But it would give a rough percentage composition: so much valine, so much arginine, so much cystine and proline and leucine. And that, in turn, would give a great deal of information. Yet it was a shot in the dark, this machine. Because they had no reason to believe that either the rock or the green organism was composed even partially of proteins. True, every living thing on earth had at least some proteins-- but that didn\u0027t mean life elsewhere had to have it. For a moment, he tried to imagine life without proteins. It was almost impossible: on earth, proteins were part of the cell wall, and comprised all the enzymes known to man. And life without enzymes? Was that possible? He recalled the remark of George Thompson, the British biochemist, who had called enzymes \"the matchmakers of life.\" It was true; enzymes acted as catalysts for all chemical reactions, by providing a surface for two molecules to come together and react upon. There were hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of enzymes, each existing solely to aid a single chemical reaction. Without enzymes, there could be no chemical reactions. Without chemical reactions, there could be no life. Or could there? It was a long-standing problem. Early in planning Wildfire, the question had been posed: How do you study a form of life totally unlike any you know? How would you even know it was alive? This was not an academic matter. Biology, as George Wald had said, was a unique science because it could not define its subject matter. Nobody had a definition for life. Nobody knew what it was, really. The old definitions-- an organism that showed ingestion, excretion, metabolism, reproduction, and so on-- were worthless. One could always find exceptions. The group had finally concluded that energy conversion was the hallmark of life. All living organisms in some way took in energy-- as food, or sunlight-- and converted it to another form of energy, and put it to use. (Viruses were the exception to this rule, but the group was prepared to define viruses as nonliving.) For the next meeting, Leavitt was asked to prepare a rebuttal to the definition. He pondered it for a week, and returned with three objects: a swatch of black cloth, a watch, and a piece of granite. He set them down before the group and said, \"Gentleman, I give you three living things.\" He then challenged the team to prove that they were not living. He placed the black cloth in the sunlight; it became warm. This, he announced, was an example of energy conversion-radiant energy to heat. It was objected that this was merely passive energy absorption, not conversion. It was also objected that the conversion, if it could be called that, was not purposeful. It served no function. \"How do you know it is not purposeful?\" Leavitt had demanded. They then turned to the watch. Leavitt pointed to the radium dial, which glowed in the dark. Decay was taking place, and light was being produced. The men argued that this was merely release of potential energy held in unstable electron levels. But there was growing confusion; Leavitt was making his point. Finally, they came to the granite. \"This is alive,\" Leavitt said. \"It is living, breathing, walking, and talking. Only we cannot see it, because it is happening too slowly. Rock has a lifespan of three billion years. We have a lifespan of sixty or seventy years. We cannot see what is happening to this rock for the same reason that we cannot make out the tune on a record being played at the rate of one revolution every century. And the rock, for its part, is not even aware of our existence because we are alive for only a brief instant of its lifespan. To it, we are like flashes in the dark.\" He held up his watch. His point was clear enough, and they revised their thinking in one important respect. They conceded that it was possible that they might not be able to analyze certain life forms. It was possible that they might not be able to make the slightest headway, the least beginning, in such an analysis. But Leavitt\u0027s concerns extended beyond this, to the general problem of action in uncertainty. He recalled reading Talbert Gregson\u0027s \"Planning the Unplanned\" with close attention, poring over the complex mathematical models the author had devised to analyze the problem. It was Gregson\u0027s conviction that: All decisions involving uncertainty fall within two distinct categories-- those with contingencies, and those without. The latter are distinctly more difficult to deal with. Most decisions, and nearly all human interaction, can be incorporated into a contingencies model. For example, a President may start a war, a man may sell his business, or divorce his wife. Such an action will produce a reaction; the number of reactions is infinite but the number of probable reactions is manageably small. Before making a decision, an individual can predict various reactions, and he can assess his original, or primary-mode, decision more effectively. But there is also a category which cannot be analyzed by contingencies. This category involves events and situations which are absolutely unpredictable, not merely disasters of all sorts, but those also including rare moments Of discovery and insight, such as those which produced the laser, or penicillin. Because these moments are unpredictable, they cannot be planned for in any logical manner. The mathematics are wholly unsatisfactory. We may only take comfort in the fact that such situations, for ill or for good, are exceedingly rare. *** Jeremy Stone, working with infinite patience, took a flake of the green material and dropped it into molten plastic. The plastic was the size and shape of a medicine capsule. He waited until the flake was firmly imbedded, and poured more plastic over it. He then transferred the plastic pill to the curing room. Stone envied the others their mechanized routines. The preparation of samples for electron microscopy was still a delicate task requiring skilled human hands; the preparation of a good sample was as demanding a, craft as that ever practiced by an artisan-- and took almost as long to learn. Stone had worked for five years before he became proficient at it. The plastic was cured in a special high-speed processing unit, but it would still take five hours to harden to proper consistency. The curing room would maintain a constant temperature of 61 deg C. with a relative humidity of 10 per cent. Once the plastic was hardened, he would scrape it away, and then flake off a small bit of green with a microtome. This would go into the electron microscope. The flake would have to be of the right thickness and size, a small round shaving 1,500 angstroms in depth, no more. Only then could he look at the green stuff, whatever it was, at sixty thousand diameters magnification. That, he thought, would be interesting. In general, Stone believed the work was going well. They were making fine progress, moving forward in several promising lines of inquiry. But most important, they had time. There was no rush, no panic, no need to fear. The bomb had been dropped on Piedmont. That would destroy airborne organisms, and neutralize the source of infection. Wildfire was the only place that any further infection could spread from, and Wildfire was specifically designed to prevent that. Should isolation be broken in the lab, the areas that were contaminated would automatically seal off. Within a half-second, sliding airtight doors would close, producing a new configuration for the lab. This was necessary because past experience in other laboratories working in so-called axenic, or germ-free, atmospheres indicated that contamination occurred in 15 per cent of cases. The reasons were usually structural-- a seal burst, a glove tore, a seam split-- but the contamination occurred, nonetheless. At Wildfire, they were prepared for that eventuality. But if it did not happen, and the odds were it would not, then they could work safely here for an indefinite period. They could spend a month, even a year, working on the organism. There was no problem, no problem at all. *** Hall walked through the corridor, looking at the atomic-detonator substations. He was trying to memorize their positions. There were five on the floor, positioned at intervals along the central corridor. Each was the same: small silver boxes no larger than a cigarette packet. Each had a lock for the key, a green light that was burning, and a dark-red light. Burton had explained the mechanism earlier. \"There are sensors in all the duct systems and in all the labs. They monitor the air in the rooms by a variety of chemical, electronic, and straight bioassay devices. The bioassay is just a mouse whose heartbeat is being monitored. If anything goes wrong with the sensors, the lab automatically seals off. If the whole floor is contaminated, it will seal off, and the atomic device will cut in. When that happens, the green light will go out, and the red light will begin to blink. That signals the start of the three-minute interval. Unless you lock in your key, the bomb will go off at the end of three minutes.\" \"And I have to do it myself?\" Burton nodded. \"The key is steel. It is conductive. The lock has a system which measures the capacitance of the person holding the key. It responds to general body size, particularly weight, and also the salt content of sweat. It\u0027s quite specific, actually, for you.\" \"So I\u0027m really the only one?\" \"You really are. And you only have one key. But there\u0027s a complicating problem. The blueprints weren\u0027t followed exactly; we only discovered the error after the lab was finished and the device was installed. But there is an error: we are short three detonator substations. There are only five, instead of eight.\" \"Meaning?\" \"Meaning that if the floor starts to contaminate, you must rush to locate yourself at a substation. Otherwise there is a chance you could be sealed off in a sector without a substation. And then, in the event of a malfunction of the bacteriologic sensors, a false positive malfunction, the laboratory could be destroyed needlessly.\" \"That seems a rather serious error in planning.\" \"It turns out,\" Burton said, \"that three new substations were going to be added next month. But that won\u0027t help us now. Just keep the problem in mind, and everything\u0027ll be all right.\" *** Leavitt awoke quickly, rolling out of bed and starting to dress. He was excited: he had just had an idea. A fascinating thing, wild, crazy, but fascinating as hell. It had come from his dream. He had been dreaming of a house, and then of a city-- a huge, complex, interconnecting city around the house. A man lived in the house, with his family; the man lived and worked and commuted within the city, moving about, acting, reacting. And then, in the dream, the city was suddenly eliminated, leaving only the house. How different things were then! A single house, standing alone, without the things it needed-- water, plumbing, electricity, streets. And a family, cut off from the supermarkets, schools, drugstores. And the husband, whose work was in the city, interrelated to others in the city, suddenly stranded. The house became a different organism altogether. And from that to the Wildfire organism was but a single step, a single leap of the imagination... He would have to discuss it with Stone. Stone would laugh, as usual-- Stone always laughed-- but he would also pay attention. Leavitt knew that, in a sense, he operated as the idea man for the team. The man who would always provide the most improbable, mind-stretching theories. Well, Stone would at least be interested. He glanced at the clock. 2200 hours. Getting on toward midnight. He hurried to dress. He took out a new paper suit and slipped his feet in. The paper was cool against his bare flesh. And then suddenly it was warm. A strange sensation. He finished dressing, stood, and zipped up the one-piece suit. As he left, he looked once again at the clock. 2210. Oh, geez, he thought. It had happened again. And this time, for ten minutes. What had gone on? He couldn\u0027t remember. But it was ten minutes gone, disappeared, while he had dressed-- an action that shouldn\u0027t have taken more than thirty seconds. He sat down again on the bed, trying to remember, but he could not. Ten minutes gone. It was terrifying. Because it was happening again, though he had hoped it would not. It hadn\u0027t happened for months, but now, with the excitement, the odd hours, the break in his normal hospital schedule, it was starting once more. For a moment, he considered telling the others, then shook his head. He\u0027d be all right. It wouldn\u0027t happen again. He was going to be just fine. He stood. He had been on his way to see Stone, to talk to Stone about something. Something important and exciting. He paused. He couldn\u0027t remember. The idea, the image, the excitement was gone. Vanished, erased from his mind. He knew then that he should tell Stone, admit the whole thing. But he knew what Stone would say and do if he found out. And he knew what it would mean to his future, to the rest of his life, once the Wildfire Project was finished. Everything would change, if people knew. He couldn\u0027t ever be normal again-- he would have to quit his job, do other things, make endless adjustments. He couldn\u0027t even drive a car. No, he thought. He would not say anything. And he would be all right: as long as he didn\u0027t look at blinking lights. *** Jeremy Stone was tired, but knew he was not ready for sleep. He paced up and down the corridors of the laboratory, thinking about the birds at Piedmont. He ran over everything they had done: how they had seen the birds, how they had gassed them with chlorazine, and how the birds had died. He went over it in his mind, again and again. Because he was missing something. And that something was bothering him. At the time, while he had been inside Piedmont itself, it had bothered him. Then he had forgotten, but his nagging doubts had been revived at the noon conference, while Hall was discussing the patients. Something Hall had said, some fact he had mentioned, was related, in some off way, to the birds. But what was it? What was the exact thought, the precise words, that had triggered the association? Stone shook his head. He simply couldn\u0027t dig it out. The clues, the connection, the keys were all there, but he couldn\u0027t bring them to the surface. He pressed his hands to his head, squeezing against the bones, and he damned his brain for being so stubborn. Like many intelligent men, Stone took a rather suspicious attitude toward his own brain, which he saw as a precise and skilled but temperamental machine. He was never surprised when the machine failed to perform, though he feared those moments, and hated them. In his blackest hours, Stone doubted the utility of all thought, and all intelligence. There were times when he envied the laboratory rats he worked with; their brains were so simple. Certainly they did not have the intelligence to destroy themselves; that was a peculiar invention of man. He often argued that human intelligence was more trouble than it was worth. It was more destructive than creative, more confusing than revealing, more discouraging than satisfying, more spiteful than charitable. There were times when he saw man, with his giant brain, as equivalent to the dinosaurs. Every schoolboy knew that dinosaurs had outgrown themselves, had become too large and ponderous to be viable. No one ever thought to consider whether the human brain, the most complex structure in the known universe, making fantastic demands on the human body in terms of nourishment and blood, was not analogous. Perhaps the human brain had become a kind of dinosaur for man and perhaps, in the end, would prove his downfall. Already, the brain consumed one quarter of the body\u0027s blood supply. A fourth of all blood pumped from the heart went to the brain, an organ accounting for only a small percentage of body mass. If brains grew larger, and better, then perhaps they would consume more-- perhaps so much that, like an infection, they would overrun their hosts and kill the bodies that transported them. Or perhaps, in their infinite cleverness, they would find a way to destroy themselves and each other. There were times when, as he sat at State Department or Defense Department meetings, and looked around the table, he saw nothing more than a dozen gray, convoluted brains sitting on the table. No flesh and blood, no hands, no eyes, no fingers. No mouths, no sex organs-- all these were superfluous. Just brains. Sitting around, trying to decide how to outwit other brains, at other conference tables. Idiotic. He shook his head, thinking that he was becoming like Leavitt, conjuring up wild and improbable schemes. Yet, there was a sort of logical consequence to Stone\u0027s ideas. If you really feared and hated your brain, you would attempt to destroy it. Destroy your own, and destroy others. \"I\u0027m tired,\" he said aloud, and looked at the wall clock. It was 2340 hours-- almost time for the midnight conference. 21. The Midnight Conference THEY MET AGAIN, IN THE SAME ROOM, IN THE SAME way. Stone glanced at the others and saw they were tired; no one, including himself, was getting enough sleep. \"We\u0027re going at this too hard,\" he said. \"We don\u0027t need to work around the clock, and we shouldn\u0027t do so. Tired men will make mistakes, mistakes in thinking and mistakes in action. We\u0027ll start to drop things, to screw things up, to work sloppily. And we\u0027ll make wrong assumptions, draw incorrect inferences. That mustn\u0027t happen.\" The team agreed to get at least six hours sleep in h c twenty-four-hour period. That seemed reasonable, Since there was no problem on the surface; the infection at Piedmont had been halted by the atomic bomb. Their belief might never have been altered had not Leavitt suggested that they file for a code name. Leavitt stated that they had an organism and that it required a code. The others agreed. In a corner of the room stood the scrambler typewriter. It had been clattering all day long, typing out material sent in from the outside. It was a two-way machine; material transmitted had to be typed in lowercase letters, while received material was printed out in capitals. No one had really bothered to look at the input since their arrival on Level V. They were all too busy; besides, most of the input had been routine military dispatches that were sent to Wildfire but did not concern it. This was because Wildfire was one of the Cooler Circuit substations, known facetiously as the Top Twenty. These substations were linked to the basement of the White House and were the twenty most important strategic locations in the country. Other substations included Vandenberg, Kennedy, NORAD, Patterson, Detrick, and Virginia Key. Stone went to the typewriter and printed out his message. The message was directed by computer to Central Codes, a station that handled the coding of all projects subsumed under the system of Cooler. The transmission was as follows: open line to transmit UNDERSTAND TRANSMIT STATE ORIGIN stone project wildfire STATE DESTINATION central codes UNDERSTAND CENTRAL CODES message follows SEND have isolated extraterrestrial organism secondary to return of scoop seven wish coding for organism end message TRANSMITTED There followed a long pause. The scrambler teleprinter hummed and clicked, but printed nothing. Then the typewriter began to spit out a message on a long roll of paper. MESSAGE FROM CENTRAL CODES FOLLOWS UNDERSTAND ISOLATION OF NEW ORGANISM PLEASE CHARACTERIZE END MESSAGE Stone frowned. \"But we don\u0027t know enough.\" However, the teleprinter was impatient: TRANSMIT REPLY TO CENTRAL CODES After a moment, Stone typed back: message to central codes follows cannot characterize at this time but suggest tentative classification as bacterial strain end message MESSAGE FROM CENTRAL CODES FOLLOWS UNDERSTAND REQUEST FOR BACTERIAL CLASSIFICATION OPENING NEW CATEGORY CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO ICDA STANDARD REFERENCE CODE FOR YOUR ORGANISM WILL BE ANDROMEDA CODE WILL READ OUT ANDROMEDA FILED UNDER ICDA LISTINGS AS 053.9 [UNSPECIFIED ORGANISM] FURTHER FILING AS E866 [AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT] THIS FILING REPRESENTS CLOSEST FIT TO ESTABLISHED CATEGORIES Stone smiled. \"It seems we don\u0027t fit the established categories.\" He typed back: understand coding as andromeda strain accepted end message TRANSMITTED \"Well,\" Stone said, \"that\u0027s that.\" Burton had been looking over the sheaves of paper behind the teleprinter. The teleprinter-wrote its messages out on a long roll of paper, which fell into a box. There were dozens of yards of paper that no one had looked at. Silently, he read a single message, tore it from the rest of the strip, and handed it to Stone. 1134/443/KK/Y-U/9 INFORMATION STATUS TRANSMIT TO ALL STATIONS CLASSIFICATION TOP SECRET REQUEST FOR DIRECTIVE 7-12 RECEIVED TODAY BY EXEC AND NBC-COBRA ORIGIN VANDENBERG/WILDFIRE CORROBORATION NASA/AMC AUTHORITY PRIMARY MANCHEK, ARTHUR, MAJOR USA","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-andromeda-strain/page-17.html","bookId":1577,"book":{"id":1577,"title":"The Andromeda Strain","description":"Storyline: The United States government is given a warning by the pre-eminent biophysicists in the country: current sterilization procedures applied to returning space probes may be inadequate to guarantee uncontaminated re-entry to the atmosphere.
