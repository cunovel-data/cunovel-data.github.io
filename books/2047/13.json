{"id":109866,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Chapter 22 A Nod to the Queen of the Damned It only took five minutes to convince the police that Tommy had been at work all night and had seen nothing. Simon had done most of the talking. Tommy was so shocked to see his book in the cop\u0027s hand that he couldn\u0027t find the answers to even the simplest questions. He was, however, able to convince the cop that his shocked state came from a body having been found outside his apartment. Sometimes it paid to play on the \"I just fell off the turnip truck from Indiana\" image. They hauled the turtles up the steps and set the crates on the floor in the kitchen area. \"Where\u0027s the little woman?\" Simon asked, eyeing the huge chest freezer. \"Probably still sleeping,\" Tommy said. \"Grab yourself a beer out of the fridge. I\u0027ll check on her.\" Tommy palmed open the bedroom door, then slipped through and closed it behind him. He thought, I\u0027ve got to keep Simon out of here. He\u0027s going to want Jody to get up and... The bed was empty. Tommy ran to the bathroom and looked in the tub, thinking that Jody might have been caught there at sunrise, but except for a rust ring, the tub was empty. He looked under the bed, found nothing but an old sock, then tore open the closet door and pushed the hanging clothes aside. Panic rose in his throat and came out in a scream of \"No!\" \"You okay in there?\" Simon said from the kitchen. \"She\u0027s not here!\" Simon opened the door. \"You got a nice crib here, Flood. You inherit some money or something?\" Simon said. Then he spotted the panic on Tommy\u0027s face. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"She\u0027s not here.\" \"So, she probably went out early to get a doughnut or something.\" \"She can\u0027t go out during the day,\" Tommy said before he realized what he was saying. \"I mean, she never goes out early.\" \"Don\u0027t sweat it. I thought you were going to teach me to read. Let\u0027s drink some beers and read some fucking books, okay?\" \"No, I have to go look for her. She could be out in the sun...\" \"Chill, Flood. She\u0027s fine. The worst that could happen is she\u0027s out with another guy. You might be a free man.\" Simon picked up a book from the stack by the bed. \"Let\u0027s read this one. What\u0027s this one?\" Tommy wasn\u0027t listening. He was seeing Jody\u0027s burned body lying in a gutter somewhere. How could she let it happen? Didn\u0027t she check the almanac? He had to look for her. But where? You can\u0027t search a city the size of San Francisco. Simon threw the book back on the stack and headed out of the bedroom, \"Okay then, Slick, I\u0027m out of here. Thanks for the beer.\" \"Okay,\" Tommy said. Then the idea of spending the day alone, waiting, threw him into another wave of panic. \"No, Simon! Wait. We\u0027ll read.\" \"That one on the top of the stack,\" Simon said. \"What\u0027s that one?\" Tommy picked it up. \"The Vampire Lestat, by Anne Rice. I hear it\u0027s good.\" \"Then grab a beer and let\u0027s get literate.\" Rivera, bleary-eyed and looking as if he had slept in his suit, sat at his desk looking over his notes. No matter how he shuffled them, they didn\u0027t make sense, didn\u0027t show a pattern. The only link between the victims was the way they had died: no motive. They wouldn\u0027t get the autopsy report for another twelve hours, but there was no doubt that the same person had done the killings. Nick Cavuto came through the squad room door carrying a box of doughnuts and a copy of the San Francisco Examiner. \"They fucking named him. The Examiner is calling him the Whiplash Killer. Once they name the killer, our problems double. You got anything?\" Rivera waved to the notes spread over his desk and shrugged. \"I\u0027m out of it, Nick. I can\u0027t even read my own writing. You take a look.\" Cavuto took a maple stick from the box and sat down across from Rivera. He grabbed a handful of papers and began leafing through them, then stopped and flipped back. He looked up. \"You talked to this Flood kid this morning, right?\" Rivera was looking at the doughnuts. His stomach lurched at the thought of eating one. \"Yeah, he lives across the street from where we found the body. He works at the Marina Safeway - was working at the time of the murder.\" Cavuto raised an eyebrow. \"The kid was staying at the motel where we found the old lady.\" \"You\u0027re kidding.\" Cavuto held out the notes for Rivera to read. \"List of guests. A uniform talked to the kid, said he was at work, but no one confirmed it.\" Rivera looked up apologetically. \"I can\u0027t believe I missed that. The kid was a little squirrelly when I talked to him. His friend did most of the talking.\" Cavuto gathered up the papers. \"Go home. Shower and sleep. I\u0027ll call the manager of the Safeway and make sure the kid was working at the time of the murders. We\u0027ll go there tonight and talk to the kid.\" \"Okay, then let\u0027s ask him how he\u0027s getting the blood out of the bodies.\" Tommy had spent two hours trying to explain the difference between vowels and consonants to Simon before he gave up and sent the cowboy home to wax his truck and watch \"Sesame Street.\" Maybe Simon wasn\u0027t meant to read. Maybe he was meant to be all instinct and no intelligence. In a way, Tommy admired him. Simon didn\u0027t worry, he took things at face value as they happened. Simon was like the strong, free and easy Cassady to Tommy\u0027s introspective, overanalytical Kerouac. Maybe he would put Simon in his story of the little girl growing up in the South. The story he would be working on if he weren\u0027t worrying about Jody. He sat all day on the couch, reading The Vampire Lestat until he couldn\u0027t concentrate anymore, then he paced the apartment, checking his watch and railing to Peary, who listened patiently from the freezer. \"You know, Peary, it\u0027s inconsiderate of her not to leave me a note. I don\u0027t have any idea what she does while I\u0027m at work. She could be having a dozen affairs and I wouldn\u0027t even know.\" He checked the almanac eight times for the time the sun would set. \"I know, I know, until I met Jody, nothing really ever happened to me. That\u0027s why I came here, right? Okay, I\u0027m being unfair, but maybe I\u0027d be better off with a normal woman. Jody just doesn\u0027t understand that I\u0027m not like other guys. That I\u0027m special. I\u0027m a writer. I can\u0027t handle stress as well as other guys - I take it personal.\" Tommy heated up a frozen dinner and left the freezer lid open so Peary could hear him better. \"I have to look to the future, you know. When I\u0027m a famous writer I\u0027m going to have to go on book tours. She can\u0027t go with me. What can I say, \u0027No, I\u0027m sorry, but I can\u0027t go. If I go away my wife will starve to death\u0027?\" He paced around the turtles, who were struggling in their crates. One of them raised his spiny head and considered Tommy. \"I know how you guys feel. Just waiting for someone to eat you. You think I don\u0027t know how that feels?\" When he could no longer look them in the eye, he carried the turtles into the bathroom, then returned to the living room and tried to get through a few more chapters of The Vampire Lestat. \"This is wrong,\" he said to Peary. \"It says that vampires don\u0027t have sex after they are turned. Of course it only talks about male vampires. What if she\u0027s been faking? You know, she could be frigid except for when she drinks my blood.\" He was working himself into a frenzy of sexual insecurity - something that felt familiar and almost comfortable - when the phone rang. He yanked it off the cradle. \"Hello.\" A woman\u0027s voice, surprised but trying to not to show it, said, \"Hello. I\u0027d like to speak to Jody, please.\" \"She\u0027s not here,\" Tommy said. \"She\u0027s at work,\" he added quickly. \"I called her at work and they said she left her job over a month ago.\" \"Uh, she has a new job. I don\u0027t know the number.\" \"Well, whoever you are,\" the woman said, losing the pretense of politeness, \"would you tell her that she still has a mother. And tell her that it is common courtesy to tell your mother when you change your phone number. And tell her that I need to know what she is going to do for the holidays.\" \"I\u0027ll tell her,\" Tommy said. \"Are you the stockbroker? What was it... Kurt?\" \"No, I\u0027m Tommy.\" \"Well, it\u0027s only two weeks until Christmas, Tommy, so if you\u0027re still around, we\u0027ll be meeting.\" \"I\u0027ll look forward to it,\" Tommy said. Like I look forward to a root canal, he thought. Jody\u0027s mom hung up. Tommy put down the phone and checked his watch. Only an hour to sunset. \"She\u0027s alive,\" he said to Peary, \"I\u0027m sure of it. If she survived her mother, she can survive anything.\" She heard steam rushing through pipes, rats scurrying in shredded paper, the spinnerets of spiders weaving webs, the footsteps of a heavy man, and the padding and panting of dogs. She opened her eyes and looked around. She was on her back on the basement floor, alone. Cardboard boxes were scattered about the room. Moonlight and sounds of movement spilled through the broken window. She got up and stepped up on a crate to look out the window. She was met by a yap and a snort and the growling countenance of a bug-eyed dog with a pan strapped to his head. \"Ack!\" She wiped the slime from her cheek. The Emperor fell to his knees and reached through the window. \"Oh goodness, are you all right, dear?\" \"Yes, I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m fine.\" \"Are you injured? Shall I call the police?\" \"No, thank you. Could you give me a hand?\" She would have leaped through the window, but it wasn\u0027t a good idea in front of the Emperor. She took his hand and let him pull her through the window. Once on her feet in the alley, she dusted off her jeans. Bummer had fallen into a yapping fit. The Emperor picked up the little dog and stuffed him into his oversized coat pocket. \"I must apologize for Bummer\u0027s behavior. There\u0027s no excuse for it, really, but he is a victim of inbreeding. Being royalty myself, I make allowances. If it\u0027s any consolation, it was only on Bummer\u0027s insistence that we ventured down this alley and found you.\" \"Well, thanks,\" Jody said. \"I don\u0027t know exactly what happened.\" \"Check your valuables, dear. You\u0027ve obviously been accosted by some ne\u0027er-do-well. Perhaps we should find you some medical attention.\" \"No, I\u0027m just a little shaken up. I just need to get home.\" \"Then please allow me and my men to escort you to your door.\" \"No, that\u0027s okay. My loft is just at the end of the alley.\" The Emperor held up his finger to caution her. \"Please, my dear. Safety first.\" Jody shrugged. \"Well, all right. Thanks.\" Bummer was squirming and snorting inside the Emperor\u0027s buttoned pocket like - well, like a pocketful of dog. \"Can he breathe in there?\" \"Bummer will be fine. He\u0027s just a bit overexcited since we\u0027ve gone to war. His first time in the field, you know.\" Jody eyed the Emperor\u0027s cruelly pointed wooden sword. \"How goes the battle?\" \"I believe we are closing in on the forces of evil. The fiend will be vanquished and victory will soon be ours.\" \"That\u0027s nice,\" Jody said. When Tommy heard her coming up the stairs he threw his book across the room, ran to the loft door, and yanked it open. Jody was standing on the landing. \"Hi,\" she said. Tommy was torn between taking her in his arms and pushing her down the steps. He just stood there. \"Hi,\" he said. Jody kissed him on the cheek and walked passed him into the loft. Tommy stood there, trying to figure out how to react. \"Are you okay?\" Once he was sure she wasn\u0027t hurt, he\u0027d tear into her for staying out all day. She fell onto the futon like a bag of rags. \"I had a really bad night.\" \"Where were you?\" \"I was in a basement, about half a block from here. I would have called, but I was dead.\" \"That\u0027s not funny. I was worried. They found a body out front last night.\" \"I know, I saw the cops all over the place outside, just before dawn. That\u0027s why I couldn\u0027t get back.\" \"The cops had my copy of On the Road in an evidence bag. I think I\u0027m in trouble.\" \"Was your name in it?\" \"No, but obviously my fingerprints were all over it. How did it get there?\" \"The vampire put it there, Tommy.\" \"How did he get it? It was here in the loft.\" \"I don\u0027t know. He\u0027s trying to freak us out. He\u0027s leaving the bodies near us so the police will connect us to the killings. He doesn\u0027t have to leave bodies at all, Tommy. He\u0027s killing these people in a way that leaves evidence.\" \"What do you mean, he doesn\u0027t have to leave bodies at all?\" \"Tommy, come here. Sit down. I have to tell you something.\" \"I don\u0027t like the tone of your voice. This is bad news, isn\u0027t it? This is the big letdown, isn\u0027t it? You were with another guy last night.\" \"Sit down and shut up, please.\" Tommy sat and she told him. Told him about the killing, about the body turning to dust, and about being dragged into the basement. When she had finished, Tommy sat for a moment looking at her, then moved away from her on the futon. \"You took the guy\u0027s money?\" \"It seemed wrong to throw it away.\" \"And killing him didn\u0027t seem wrong?\" \"No, it didn\u0027t. I can\u0027t explain it. It felt like I was supposed to.\" \"If you were hungry you should have told me. I don\u0027t mind, really.\" \"It wasn\u0027t like that, Tommy. Look, I don\u0027t know how to file this - emotionally, I mean. I don\u0027t feel like I killed someone. The point I\u0027m trying to make is that the body crumbled to dust. There was no body. The people the vampire is killing aren\u0027t dying from his bite. He\u0027s breaking their necks before they die. He\u0027s doing all this on purpose to scare me. I\u0027m afraid he might hurt you to get at me. I\u0027ve suspected it for a long time, but I didn\u0027t want to say anything to you. If you want to leave, I\u0027ll understand.\" \"I didn\u0027t say anything about leaving. I don\u0027t know what to do. How would you feel if I told you I had killed someone?\" \"It would depend. This guy wanted to die. He was in pain. He was going to die anyway.\" \"Do you want me to leave?\" \"Of course not. But I need you to try and understand.\" \"I am trying. That\u0027s all I\u0027ve been doing. Why do you think I\u0027ve been doing all these experiments? You act like this is easy for me. I\u0027ve been a mess all day worrying about you and you\u0027re in a basement a few steps away. What about that? Who dragged you into the basement?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Whoever it was saved your life. Was it the vampire?\" \"I said, I don\u0027t know.\" Tommy went across the room and pick up the paperback of The Vampire Lestat. \"This guy, Lestat, he can tell when there\u0027s another vampire around. He can sense it. Can\u0027t you sense it?\" \"Right, and that\u0027s why we have a dead guy in the freezer. No, I can\u0027t sense it.\" Tommy held up the book. \"There\u0027s a whole history of the vampire race in here. I think this Anne Rice knows a real vampire or something.\" \"That\u0027s what you thought about Bram Stoker, too. And I spent an hour standing on a chair trying to turn into a bat.\" \"No, this is different. Lestat isn\u0027t evil, he likes humans. He only kills murderers that are without remorse. He knows when there are other vampires around. Lestat can fly.\" Jody jumped up and ripped the book out of his hand. \"And Anne Rice can write, Tommy, but I\u0027m not throwing that in your face.\" \"You don\u0027t have to get personal.\" \"Look, Tommy, maybe there\u0027s some truth in one of these books that you\u0027re reading, but how do we know which one? Huh? Nobody gave me a fucking owner\u0027s manual when I got these fangs. I\u0027m doing the best that I can.\" Tommy looked away from her, then at his shoes. \"You\u0027re right, I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m confused and I\u0027m a little scared. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing either. Hell, Jody, you might have AIDS now, we don\u0027t know.\" \"I don\u0027t have AIDS. I know I don\u0027t.\" \"How do you know? It\u0027s not like we can send you down to the clinic to test you or anything.\" \"I know it, Tommy. I could feel it if I did. Except for sunlight and food, I\u0027m not even allergic to anything anymore. Hand lotions and soaps I couldn\u0027t get near before without breaking into a rash don\u0027t affect me. I\u0027ve done a few experiments of my own. My body won\u0027t let anything hurt me. I\u0027m safe. Besides...\" Jody paused and grinned, waiting for him to ask. \"Besides what?\" \"He was wearing a condom.\" Tommy resumed staring at his shoes, said nothing, then looked up at her and laughed. \"That\u0027s incredibly sick, Jody.\" She nodded and laughed. \"I love you,\" he said, moving to her and taking her in his arms. \"Me too,\" she said, hugging him back. \"That\u0027s really sick, you know that?\" \"Yep,\" she said. \"Tommy, I don\u0027t want to break this beautiful moment, but I have to take a shower.\" She kissed him and pushed him away gently, then headed into the bathroom. \"Uh, Jody,\" he called after her, \"I got a present for you in Chinatown today.\" There\u0027s an explanation for this, she thought, standing in the bathroom, looking at the turtles. There is a perfectly good reason why there are two huge snapping turtles in my tub. \"Do you like them?\" Tommy was standing in the doorway behind her. \"These are for me, then?\" She tried to smile. She really did. \"Yeah, Simon helped me get them home. I didn\u0027t think I could carry them on the bus. Aren\u0027t they great?\" Jody looked in the tub again. The turtles were trying to crawl on top of each other. Their claws screeched on the porcelain when they moved. \"I don\u0027t know what to say,\" Jody said. \"I thought that we could feed them fish and stuff, and you\u0027d have a blood supply right here at home. Besides me, I mean.\" She turned and regarded Tommy. Yes, he was serious. He was really serious. \"You haven\u0027t...\" \"Their names are Scott and Zelda. Zelda is missing a toe on her back foot. That\u0027s how you tell them apart. Do you like them? You seem a little reticent.\" A little, she thought. You couldn\u0027t have brought me flowers or jewelry, like most guys. You had to say it with reptiles. \"I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any chance that you saved the receipt?\" Tommy\u0027s face avalanched into disappointment. \"You don\u0027t like them.\" \"No, they\u0027re fine. But, I really wanted to take a shower. I\u0027m not sure I want to be naked in front of them.\" \"Oh,\" Tommy said, brightening. \"I\u0027ll take them into the living room.\" He pulled a towel off the rod and began maneuvering over the tub, trying to get a drop on Zelda. \"You have to be careful; they can take off a finger in those jaws.\" \"I see,\" Jody said. But she didn\u0027t see at all. The idea of biting one of the spiny creatures in the tub gave her an industrial-size case of the creeps. Tommy lunged and came up with Zelda, wrapped in swaddling clothes and snapping at his face. \"She hates being picked up.\" Zelda\u0027s claws tore at the towel and Tommy\u0027s shirt as she attempted to swim through midair. He set the turtle on her back on the bathroom floor and readied the towel to lunge into the tub for Scott. \"Lestat can call animals to him when he\u0027s hungry. Maybe you can train them.\" \"Stop it with the Lestat stuff, Tommy. I\u0027m not sucking turtles.\" He turned to her and slipped, falling into the tub. Scott snapped, barely missing Tommy\u0027s arm, and latched on to the sleeve of his denim shirt. \"I\u0027m okay. I\u0027m okay. He didn\u0027t get me.\" Jody pulled him from the tub. Scott was still attached to his sleeve and was determined not to let go. Turtles hate heights. They don\u0027t even like being a few feet off the ground. It\u0027s the main reason they have resisted evolution for so long - fear of heights. Turtle thinking goes thus: Sure, first our scales turn into feathers and the next thing you know we\u0027re flying and chirping and perching on trees. We\u0027ve seen it happen. Thanks, but we\u0027re staying right here in the mud where we belong. You\u0027re not going to see us flying full-tilt boogie into a sliding glass door. Scott was not letting go of the sleeve, not as long as Tommy was standing. \"Help me,\" Tommy said. \"Pry him off.\" Jody looked for a place on the turtle to grab - reached out and pulled back several times. \"I don\u0027t want to touch him.\" The phone rang. \"I\u0027ll get it,\" Jody said, running out of the bathroom. Tommy dragged Scott to the doorway, keeping his feet safely away from Zelda\u0027s jaws. \"I forgot to tell you...\" \"Hello,\" Jody said into the phone. \"Oh, hi, Mom.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodsucking-fiends-a-love-story-a-love-story-1/page-13.html","bookId":2047,"book":{"id":2047,"title":"Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story (A Love Story #1)","description":"Storyline: Here\u0027s something different: a vampire novel that\u0027s light, funny, and not at all hackneyed.
