{"id":2047,"title":"Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story (A Love Story #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Here\u0027s something different: a vampire novel that\u0027s light, funny, and not at all hackneyed. Between scenes of punks bowling frozen turkeys on the graveyard shift in a supermarket, or snapping turtles loose in a loft and gnawing on designer shoes, this novel has comic charm to spare. But it also packs an appealingly downbeat message about the consumer culture: Becoming a vampire has given the twentysomething heroine \"a crampless case of rattlesnake PMS\"--a grumpy mood in which she realizes that she can dress to the nines as a \"Donner Party Barbie\" and still end up disillusioned and unhappy, just another slacker doing her own laundry and watching sucky TV \u0027til the sun rises.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/bloodsucking-fiends-a-love-story-a-love-story-1.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":23,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
