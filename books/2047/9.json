The second time was less urgent and they tried to impress each other with their respective repertoires of mattress tricks. Jody was careful not to appear too experienced and Tommy pulled on everything he had ever read, from Penthouse to National Geographic, trying not to appear too naive, while fighting the urge to shout \"Gee whiz\" with her every move. There was entirely too much thinking involved on both their parts and they finished thinking, Well, that was pretty okay. Jody\u0027s fangs stayed safely sheathed behind her canines.\n She said, \"What was that you shouted at the end?\"\n \"It was a Bantu love cry. I think it translates, \u0027Oh baby, polish my lip saucer. \u0026raquo;\n \"Interesting,\" Jody said.\n They lay there for a while, not talking, feeling uncomfortable and a little embarrassed. Whatever intimacy they shared physically was not echoed emotionally. They were strangers.\n Tommy felt that he should confess something personal, something to match the outrageous trust she had put in him by telling him her secret. At the same time he was curious, and a little bit afraid. It wasn\u0027t as if she had shown him a hidden tattoo. She was a vampire. How do you match that? How do you file that? Under \"Adventure,\" he thought. I wanted adventure, and here it is.\n \"Tommy,\" she said, not looking at him, talking more or less to the ceiling, \"I\u0027ll understand if you don\u0027t want to stay, but I\u0027d like you to.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never lived with anyone before. This is all new to me. I mean, you probably have a lot more experience than I do at this.\"\n \"Well, not exactly like this. I\u0027ve lived with a few guys.\"\n \"A few?\"\n \"Ten, I think. But not under these circumstances.\"\n \"Ten? You must be ancient. No offense. I mean, I knew that you were older, but I thought it was just a few years. Not centuries.\"\n She rolled over and looked him in the eye. \"I\u0027m twenty-six.\"\n \"Sure, you look twenty-six. But you\u0027ve probably looked this way for years. You probably have pictures of yourself with Abraham Lincoln and stuff, right?\"\n \"No, I\u0027m twenty-six. I\u0027ve been twenty-six for about six months.\"\n \"But how long... I mean... Were you born like...\"\n \"I\u0027ve been a vampire for four days.\"\n \"So you\u0027re twenty-six.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been telling you.\"\n \"And you\u0027ve lived with ten guys?\"\n She got out of bed and started gathering her clothes. \"Look, I don\u0027t use the best judgment when it comes to relationships. Okay?\"\n He turned away from her. \"Well, thanks a lot.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t mean you. I meant in the past.\"\n He sat on the edge of the bed and hung his head. \"I feel so used.\"\n \"Used?\" She leaped over the bed and stood in front of him. \"Used?\" She put her finger under his chin and lifted it until he was looking at her. \"I\u0027ve trusted you with the biggest secret I have. I\u0027ve offered to share my life with you.\"\n \"Oh, like that\u0027s an exclusive privilege.\" He pulled away from her and resumed pouting.\n Jody snatched a shoe off the floor and prepared to whack him with it, then remembered what she had done to Kurt and dropped it. \"Why are you being such an asshole?\"\n \"You drank my blood!\"\n \"Yeah, well, I\u0027m sorry about that.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t even ask.\"\n \"And you didn\u0027t protest, either.\"\n \"I thought it was a sex thing.\"\n \"It was.\"\n \"It was?\" He stopped pouting and looked up at her. \"Does that turn you on?\"\n Jody thought, Why are men never prepared for the toxic radiation of afterglow? Why can\u0027t they ride it through without becoming detached whiners or aggressive jerks? They don\u0027t get it, that cuddling afterward has nothing to do with warm, fuzzy feelings; it\u0027s just the most intelligent way to ride the wave of post-coital depression.\n \"Tommy, I came so hard, my toes curled. No man has ever made me feel like that before.\" How many times have I said that? she thought.\n \"Yeah?\"\n She nodded.\n He smiled, feeling proud of himself. \"Let\u0027s do it again.\"\n \"No, we need to talk.\"\n \"Okay. But then...\"\n \"Put on your clothes.\"\n Tommy scampered naked out of the bedroom to get a fresh pair of jeans from his suitcase. As he dressed, the infinite possibilities of life swam through his head. Only a week ago he had been staring down the barrel of a life spent in a factory town - of a union job, of a series of financed Fords, a mortgage, too many kids, and a wife who\u0027d go to fat. Sure, there was a certain nobility in being responsible and raising a family - seeing that they never did without. But when his father told him on his eighteenth birthday that he needed to start planning his retirement, he felt his future tighten on him like an anaconda. His father had made it clear that the money for college wasn\u0027t there - so after he went to the City and starved, he could come home and get a job down at the factory and get down to the business of being an adult. But not now. He was a City guy now, part of the world; he was involved with a vampire, and the danger of living a normal, boring life had passed completely. He knew he should be afraid, but he was too elated to think about it.\n He slid into his jeans and ran back to the bedroom, where Jody was getting dressed. \"I\u0027m hungry,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s go out and get something to eat.\"\n \"I can\u0027t eat,\" she said.\n \"Not at all?\"\n \"Not as far as I know. I can\u0027t even keep a glass of water down.\"\n \"Wow. Do you have to have blood every day?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"Does it have to be - I mean, can you use animals, or does it have to be people?\"\n Jody thought about the moth she had eaten and felt as if she\u0027d just downed a cocktail mixed of two parts shame and five parts disgust, with a twist of nausea. \"I don\u0027t know, Tommy. I didn\u0027t exactly get an instruction book.\"\n He was bouncing around the room like a hyperactive child. \"How did it happen? Did you sell your soul to Satan? Am I going to turn into a vampire? Are you in a coven or something?\"\n She wheeled on him. \"Look, I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know anything. Let me get dressed and we\u0027ll go get something for you to eat. I\u0027ll explain then, okay?\"\n \"Well, you don\u0027t have to bite my head off.\"\n \"Maybe I do,\" she snarled, surprised at the acid in her voice.\n Tommy backed away from her, his eyes wide with fear. She felt horrible. Why did I say that? This was happening too often, this loss of control - showing her burned hand to the bum on the bus, knocking Kurt out, eating the moth, and now threatening Tommy; none of it seemed to be by choice. It was as if vampirism carried with it a crampless case of rattlesnake PMS.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Tommy. This has been hard.\"\n \"It\u0027s okay.\" He picked up the jeans she had destroyed and began emptying the pockets. \"I guess these are done for.\" He pulled out the business card that the motel manager had given him. \"Hey, I forgot to tell you. This cop wants to talk to you.\"\n Jody stopped in the middle of tying her shoes. \"Cop?\"\n \"Yeah, an old lady was killed at the motel last night. There were a zillion cops around when I got there this morning. They wanted to talk to everyone that was staying in the motel.\"\n \"How was she killed, Tommy? Do you know?\"\n \"Somebody broke her neck and...\" He stopped and stared at her, backing away again toward the bathroom.\n \"What?\" she demanded. \"Her neck was broken and what?\"\n \"She\u0027d lost a lot of blood,\" he whispered. \"But there weren\u0027t any wounds.\" He bolted into the bathroom and shut the door.\n Jody could hear him throw the lock. \"I didn\u0027t kill her, Tommy.\"\n \"That\u0027s fine,\" he said.\n \"Open the door. Please.\"\n \"I can\u0027t, I\u0027m peeing.\" He turned on the water.\n \"Tommy, come out, I\u0027m not going to hurt you. Let\u0027s go get you something to eat and I\u0027ll explain.\"\n \"You go ahead,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll catch up to you. Wow, I really had to go. Must have been all that coffee I drank today.\"\n \"Tommy, I swear I didn\u0027t know anything about this until you told me.\"\n \"Look at this,\" he said through the door, \"I found that crucifix I lost last week. And what\u0027s this? My lucky vial of holy water.\"\n \"Tommy, stop it. I\u0027m not going to hurt you. I don\u0027t want to hurt anybody.\"\n \"Oh, my garlic wreath. I wondered where I\u0027d put that.\" Jody grabbed the door knob and yanked. The doorjamb splintered and the door came away in her hand. Tommy dived into the tub and peeked over the edge at her.\n She said, \"Let\u0027s go get you something to eat. We need to talk.\" He pulled himself up slowly, ready to dive down the drain if she made a move. She backed away.\n He looked at the ruined doorjamb. \"We\u0027re going to lose our deposit now; you know that, right?\" Jody threw the door aside and offered her hand to help him out of the tub. \"Can I buy you some fries? I\u0027d really like to watch you eat some French fries.\"\n \"That\u0027s weird, Jody.\"\n \"Compared to what?\"\n They walked to Market Street where, even at ten o\u0027clock, the sidewalks were crowded with bums and hustlers and teams of podiatrists who had escaped the Moscone Convention Center to seek out burgers, pizzas, and beer in the heart of the City. Jody watched the heat ghosts trailing the street people while Tommy handed out coins like a meter-maid angel trying to atone for a lifetime of giving chickenshit tickets.\n He dropped a quarter into the palm of a half-fingered glove worn by a woman who was pretending to be a robot, but who looked more like a golem newly shaped from gutter filth. Jody noticed a black aura around the woman, as she had seen around the old man on the bus; she could smell disease and the rawness of open lesions and she almost pulled Tommy away.\n A few steps away she said, \"You don\u0027t have to give them all money just because they ask, you know.\"\n \"I know, but if I give them money I don\u0027t see their faces when I\u0027m about to fall asleep.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t really help. She\u0027ll just spend it on booze or drugs.\"\n \"If I was her, so would I.\"\n \"Good point,\" Jody said. She took his arm and led him into a burger joint named No Guilt: orange Formica tables over industrial-gray carpet, giant backlit transparencies of food glistening with grease, and families gleefully clogging their arteries together. \"Is this okay?\"\n \"Perfect,\" Tommy said.\n They took a table by the window and Jody trembled while Tommy ordered a brace of burgers and a basket of fries.\n She said, \"Tell me about the woman who was killed.\"\n \"She had a dog, a little gray dog. They found them both in the dumpster at the motel. She was old. Now she\u0027ll always be old.\"\n \"Pardon?\"\n \"People always stay the age that they died at. My big brother died of leukemia when I was six. He was eight. Now when I think of him, he\u0027s always eight, and he\u0027s still my big brother. He never changes, and the part of me that remembers him never changes. See. What about you?\"\n \"I don\u0027t have any brothers or sisters.\"\n \"No, I mean, are you going to stay the same? Will you always look like this now?\"\n \"I haven\u0027t thought about it. I guess it could be true. I know I heal really fast since it happened.\"\n The waitress brought Tommy\u0027s food. He squirted ketchup on the fries and attacked. \"Tell me,\" he said around a mouthful of burger.\n Jody started slowly as she watched his every bite with envy, telling him first about her life before the attack, of growing up in Monterey and dropping out of community college when her life didn\u0027t seem to be moving fast enough. Then of moving to San Francisco, of her jobs and her loves and the few life lessons she had learned. She told him about that night of the attack in too much detail, and in the telling she realized how little she understood about what had happened to her. She told him about waking up, and of how her strength and senses had changed, and it was here that words began to fail her - there were no words to describe some of the things she had seen and felt. She told him about the call at the motel and about being followed by the other vampire. When she had finished she felt more confused than when she had started.\n Tommy said, \"So you\u0027re not immortal. He said that you could be killed.\"\n \"I guess; I don\u0027t seem to change. All my childhood scars are gone, the lines on my face. My body seems to have lifted a little.\"\n Tommy grinned. \"You do have a great body.\"\n \"I could lose five pounds,\" Jody said. She inhaled sharply and her eyes went wide, as if she\u0027d just remembered some explosives she\u0027d left in the oven. \"Oh my God!\"\n \"What?\" Tommy looked around, thinking she had seen something frightening, something dangerous.\n \"This is horrible.\"\n \"What is it?\" Tommy insisted.\n \"I just realized - I\u0027m always going to be a pudgette. I have jeans I\u0027ll never get into. I\u0027m always going to need to lose five pounds.\"\n \"So what, every woman I\u0027ve ever known thought she needed to lose five pounds.\"\n \"But they have a chance, they have hope. I\u0027m doomed.\"\n \"You could go on a liquid diet,\" Tommy said.\n \"Very funny.\" She pinched her hip to confirm her observation. \"Five pounds. If he\u0027d only waited another week to attack. I was on the yogurt-and-grapefruit diet. I would have made it. I\u0027d be thin forever.\" She realized that she was obsessing and turned her attention to Tommy. \"How\u0027s your neck, by the way?\"\n He rubbed the spot where she had bitten him. \"It\u0027s fine. I can\u0027t even feel a mark.\"\n \"You don\u0027t feel weak?\"\n \"No more than usual.\"\n Jody smiled. \"I don\u0027t know how much I... I mean, I don\u0027t have any way of measuring or anything.\"\n \"No, I\u0027m fine. It was kind of sexy. I just wonder how I healed so fast.\"\n \"It seems to work that way.\"\n \"Let\u0027s try something.\" He held his hand by her face. \"Lick my finger.\"\n She pushed his hand away. \"Tommy, just finish eating and we can go home and do this.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s an experiment. My cuticles get split from cutting boxes at the store. I want to see if you can heal them.\" He touched her lower lip. \"Go ahead, lick.\"\n She snaked out a tentative tongue and licked the tip of his finger, then took his finger in her mouth and ran her tongue around it.\n \"Wow,\" Tommy said. He pulled his finger out and looked at it. His cuticle, which had been split and torn, had healed. \"This is great. Look.\"\n Jody studied his cuticle. \"It worked.\"\n \"Do another.\" He thrust another finger in her mouth.\n She spit it out. \"Stop that.\"\n \"Come on.\" He pushed at her lips. \"Pleeeeze.\"\n A big guy in a Forty-Niners sweatshirt leaned over from the table next to them and said, \"Buddy, do you mind? I\u0027ve got my kids here.\"\n \"Sorry,\" Tommy said, wiping vampire spit on his shirt. \"We were just experimenting.\"\n \"Yeah, well, this isn\u0027t the place for it, okay?\"\n \"Right,\" Tommy said.\n \"See?\" Jody whispered. \"I told you.\"\n \"Let\u0027s go home,\" Tommy said. \"I\u0027ve got a blister on my big toe.\"\n \"No fucking way, writer-boy.\"\n \"It\u0027s low in calories,\" Tommy coaxed, prodding her foot with his sneaker. \"Good, and good for you.\"\n \"Not a chance.\"\n Tommy sighed in defeat. \"Well, I guess we\u0027ve got more to worry about than my toe or your weight problem.\"\n \"Like what?\"\n \"Like the fact that last night I saw a guy in the store parking lot that I think was the other vampire.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodsucking-fiends-a-love-story-a-love-story-1/page-9.html","bookId":2047,"book":{"id":2047,"title":"Bloodsucking Fiends: A Love Story (A Love Story #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Here\u0027s something different: a vampire novel that\u0027s light, funny, and not at all hackneyed.
