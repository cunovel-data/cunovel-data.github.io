{"id":45035,"no":30,"title":"V A FRESCO OF SIGNORELLI","content":"A week later Father Gondo was in Rome. He was granted an interview with the old man in the Vatican and told him how he had found Antichrist in the likeness of Christ, how the former had entangled the people of Diamante in worldliness, and how he, Father Gondo, had wished to burn him. He also told how he had not been able to lead the people back to God. Instead, all Diamante had fallen into unbelief and socialism. No one there cared for his soul; no one thought of heaven. Father Gondo asked what he should do with those unfortunate people. \\n\\n \\n\\n The old pope, who is wiser than any one now living, did not laugh at Father Gondo’s story; he was deeply distressed by it. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You have done wrong; you have done very wrong,” he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n He sat silent for a while and pondered; then he said: “You have not seen the Cathedral in Orvieto?”—“No, Holy Father.”—“Then go there now and see it,” said the pope; “and when you come back again, you shall tell me what you have seen there.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Father Gondo obeyed. He went to Orvieto and saw the most holy Cathedral. And in two days he was back in the Vatican. \\n\\n \\n\\n [374] \\n\\n \\n\\n “What did you see in Orvieto?” the pope asked him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Father Gondo said that in one of the chapels of the Cathedral he had found some frescoes of Luca Signorelli, representing “The Last Judgment.” But he had not looked at either the “Last Judgment” or at the “Resurrection of The Dead.” He had fixed all his attention on the big painting which the guide called “The Miracles of Antichrist.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “What did you see in it?” asked the pope. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I saw that Signorelli had painted Antichrist as a poor and lowly man, just as the Son of God was when he lived here on earth. I saw that he had dressed him like Christ and given him Christ’s features.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “What more did you see?” said the pope. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The first thing that I saw in the fresco was Antichrist preaching so that the rich and the mighty came and laid their treasures at his feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The second thing I saw was a sick man brought to Antichrist and healed by him. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The third thing I saw was a martyr proclaiming Antichrist and suffering death for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The fourth thing I saw in the great wall-picture was the people hastening to a great temple of peace, the spirit of evil hurled from heaven, and all men of violence killed by heaven’s thunderbolts.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “What did you think when you saw that?” asked the pope. \\n\\n \\n\\n “When I saw it, I thought: ‘That Signorelli was mad. Does he mean that in the time of Antichrist evil shall be conquered, and the earth become holy as a paradise?’” \\n\\n \\n\\n [375] \\n\\n \\n\\n “Did you see anything else?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “The fifth thing I saw depicted in the painting was the monks and priests piled up on a big bonfire and burned. \\n\\n \\n\\n “And the sixth and last thing I saw was the Devil whispering in Antichrist’s ear, and suggesting to him how he was to act and speak.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “What did you think when you saw that?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I said to myself: ‘That Signorelli is not mad; he is a prophet. Antichrist will certainly come in the likeness of Christ and make a paradise of the world. He will make it so beautiful that the people will forget heaven. And it will be the world’s most terrible temptation.’” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Do you understand now,” said the pope, “that there was nothing new in all that you told me? The Church has always known that Antichrist would come, armed with the virtues of Christ.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Did you also know that he had actually come, Holy Father?” asked Father Gondo. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Could I sit here on Peter’s chair year after year without knowing that he has come?” said the pope. “I see starting a movement of the people, which burns with love for its neighbor and hates God. I see people becoming martyrs for the new hope of a happy earth. I see how they receive new joy and new courage from the words ‘Think of the earth,’ as they once found them in the words ‘Think of heaven.’ I knew that he whom Signorelli had foretold had come.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Father Gondo bowed silently. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Do you understand now wherein you did wrong?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Holy Father, enlighten me as to my sin.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The old pope looked up. His clear eyes looked[376] through the veil of chance which shrouds future events and saw what was hidden behind it. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Father Gondo,” he said, “that little child with whom you fought in Diamante, the child who was merciful and wonder-working like Christ, that poor, despised child who conquered you and whom you call Antichrist, do you not know who he is?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No, Holy Father.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And he who in Signorelli’s picture healed the sick, and softened the rich, and felled evil-doers to the earth, who transformed the earth to a paradise and tempted the people to forget heaven. Do you not know who he is?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No, Holy Father.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Who else can he be but the Antichristianity, socialism?” \\n\\n \\n\\n The monk looked up in terror. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Father Gondo,” said the pope, sternly, “when you held the image in your arms you wished to burn him. Why? Why were you not loving to him? Why did you not carry him back to the little Christchild on the Capitolium from whom he proceeded? \\n\\n \\n\\n “That is what you wandering monks could do. You could take the great popular movement in your arms, while it is still lying like a child in its swaddling clothes, and you could bear it to Jesus’ feet; and Antichrist would see that he is nothing but an imitation of Christ, and would acknowledge him his Lord and Master. But you do not do so. You cast Antichristianity on the pyre, and soon he in his turn will cast you there.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Father Gondo bent his knee. “I understand, Holy Father. I will go and look for the image.” \\n\\n \\n\\n [377] \\n\\n \\n\\n The pope rose majestically. “You shall not look for the image; you shall let him go his way through the ages. We do not fear him. When he comes to storm the Capitol in order to mount the throne of the world, we shall meet him, and we shall lead him to Christ. We shall make peace between earth and heaven. But you do wrong,” he continued more mildly, “to hate him. You must have forgotten that the sibyl considered him one of the redeemers of the world. ‘On the heights of the Capitol the redeemer of the world shall be worshipped, Christ or Antichrist.’” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Holy Father, if the miseries of this world are to be remedied by him, and heaven suffers no injury, I shall not hate him.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The old pope smiled his most subtle smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Father Gondo, you will permit me also to tell you a Sicilian story. The story goes, Father Gondo, that when Our Lord was busy creating the world, He wished one day to know if He had much more work to do. And He sent San Pietro out to see if the world was finished. \\n\\n \\n\\n “When San Pietro came back, he said: ‘Every one is weeping and sobbing and lamenting.’ \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Then the world is not finished,’ said Our Lord, and He went on working. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Three days later Our Lord sent San Pietro again to the earth. \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Everyone is laughing and rejoicing and playing,’ said San Pietro, when he came back. \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Then the world is not finished,’ said Our Lord, and He went on working. \\n\\n \\n\\n “San Pietro was dispatched for the third time. \\n\\n \\n\\n [378] \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Some are weeping and some are laughing,’ he said, when he came back. \\n\\n \\n\\n “‘Then the world is finished,’ said Our Lord. \\n\\n \\n\\n “And so shall it be and continue,” said the old pope. “No one can save mankind from their sorrows, but much is forgiven to him who brings new courage to bear them.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1787/52043.html","bookId":1081,"book":{"id":1081,"title":"The Miracles of Antichrist","description":"简介： It happened once upon a time that a very great and holy night sank down over the earth.
