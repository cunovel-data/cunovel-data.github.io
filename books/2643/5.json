{"id":103501,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Chapter 5 Well, it worked, I finally got the angel to leave the room. It went like this: Raziel called down to the front desk and asked him to send Jesus up. A few minutes later our Latin pal stood at attention at the foot of the angel\u0027s bed. Raziel said, \"Tell him I need a Soap Opera Digest.\" In Spanish, I said, \"Good afternoon, Jesus. How are you today?\" \"I am well, sir, and you?\" \"As good as can be expected, considering this man is holding me prisoner.\" \"Tell him to hurry,\" said Raziel. \"He doesn\u0027t understand Spanish?\" Jesus asked. \"Not a word of it, but don\u0027t start speaking Hebrew or I\u0027m sunk.\" \"Are you really a prisoner? I wondered why you two never left the room. Should I call the police?\" \"No, that won\u0027t be necessary, but please shake your head and look apologetic.\" \"What is taking so long?\" Raziel said. \"Give him the money and tell him to go.\" \"He said he is not allowed to buy publications for you, but he can direct you to a place where you can purchase them yourself.\" \"That\u0027s ridiculous, he\u0027s a servant, isn\u0027t he? He will do as I ask.\" \"Oh my, Jesus, he has asked if you would like to feel the power of his manly nakedness.\" \"Is he crazy? I have a wife and two children.\" \"Sadly, yes. Please show him that you are offended by his offer by spitting on him and storming out of the room.\" \"I don\u0027t know, sir, spitting on a guest...\" I handed him a handful of the bills that he\u0027d taught me were appropriate gratuities. \"Please, it will be good for him.\" \"Very well, Mister Biff.\" He produced an impressive loogie and launched it at the front of the angel\u0027s robe, where it splatted and ran. Raziel leapt to his feet. \"Well done, Jesus, now curse.\" \"You fuckstick!\" \"In Spanish.\" \"Sorry, I was showing off my English. I know many swear words.\" \"Well done. Spanish please.\" \"Pendejo!\" \"Splendid, now storm out.\" Jesus turned on his heel and left the room, slamming the door behind him. \"He spit on me?\" Raziel said, still not believing it. \"An angel of the Lord, and he spit on me.\" \"Yes, you offended him.\" \"He called me a fuckstick. I heard him.\" \"In his culture, it is an affront to ask another man to buy a Soap Opera Digest for you. We\u0027ll be lucky if he ever brings us a pizza again.\" \"But I want a Soap Opera Digest.\" \"He said you can buy one just down the street, I will be happy to go get one for you.\" \"Not so fast, Apostle, none of your tricks. I\u0027ll get it myself, you stay here.\" \"You\u0027ll need money.\" I handed him some bills. \"If you leave the room I will find you in an instant, you know that?\" \"Absolutely.\" \"You cannot hide from me.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t dream of it. Hurry now.\" He sort of shuffled sideways toward the door. \"Don\u0027t try to lock me out, I\u0027m taking a key with me. Not that I need it or anything, being an angel of the Lord.\" \"Not to mention a fuckstick.\" \"I don\u0027t even know what that means.\" \"Go, go, go.\" I shooed him through the door. \"Godspeed, Raziel.\" \"Work on your Gospel while I\u0027m gone.\" \"Right.\" I slammed the door in his face and threw the safety lock. Raziel has now watched hundreds of hours of American television, you\u0027d think he would have noticed that people wear shoes when they go outside. The book is exactly as I suspected, a Bible, but written in a flowery version of this English I\u0027ve been writing in. The translation of the Torah and the prophets from the Hebrew is muddled sometimes, but the first part seems to be our Bible. This language is amazing - so many words. In my time we had very few words, perhaps a hundred that we used all the time, and thirty of them were synonyms for guilt. In this language you can curse for an hour and never use the same word twice. Flocks and schools and herds of words, that\u0027s why I\u0027m supposed to use this language to tell Joshua\u0027s story. I\u0027ve hidden the book in the bathroom, so I can sneak in and read it while the angel is in the room. I didn\u0027t have time to actually read much of the part of the book they call the New Testament, but it\u0027s obvious that it is the story of Joshua\u0027s life. Or parts of it, anyway. I\u0027ll study it later, but now I should go on with the real story. I suppose I should have considered the exact nature of what we were doing before I invited Maggie to join us. I mean, there is some difference between the circumcision of an eight-day-old baby boy, which she had seen before, and the same operation on the ten-foot statue of a Greek god. \"My goodness, that is, uh, impressive,\" Maggie said, staring up at the marble member. \"Graven image,\" Joshua said under his breath. Even in the moonlight I could tell he was blushing. \"Let\u0027s do it.\" I pulled a small iron chisel from my pouch. Joshua was wrapping the head of his mallet with leather to deaden its sound. Sepphoris slept around us, the silence broken only by the occasional bleat of a sheep. The evening cook fires had long since gone to coals, the dust cloud that stirred through the city during the day had settled, and the night air was clean and still. From time to time I would catch a sweet whiff of sandalwood coming from Maggie and I would lose my train of thought. Funny the things you remember. We found a bucket and turned it upside down for Joshua to stand on while he worked. He set the tip of my chisel on Apollo\u0027s foreskin and ventured a light tap with the mallet. A tiny fragment of marble flaked away. \"Give it a good whack,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t, it will make too much noise.\" \"No, it won\u0027t, the leather will cover it.\" \"But I might take the whole end of it off.\" \"He can spare it,\" Maggie said, and we both turned to her with our mouths hanging open. \"Probably,\" she added quickly. \"I\u0027m only guessing. What do I know, I\u0027m just a girl. Do you guys smell something?\" We smelled the Roman before we heard him, heard him before we saw him. The Romans covered themselves with olive oil before they bathed, so if the wind was right or if it was an especially hot day you could smell a Roman coming at thirty paces. Between the olive oil they bathed with and the garlic and dried paste of anchovies they ate with their barley, when the legions marched into battle it must have smelled like an invasion of pizza people. If they\u0027d had pizzas back then, which they didn\u0027t. Joshua took a quick swipe with the mallet and the chisel slipped, neatly severing Apollo\u0027s unit, which fell to the dirt with a dull thud. \"Whoops,\" said the Savior. \"Shhhhhhhh,\" I shushed. We heard the hobnails of the Roman\u0027s boots scraping on stone. Joshua jumped down from the bucket and looked frantically for a place to hide. The walls of the Greek\u0027s bathhouse were almost completed around the statue, so really, except for the entrance where the Roman was coming, there was no place to run. \"Hey, what are you doing there?\" We stood as still as the statue. I could see that it was the legionnaire that had been with Justus our first day in Sepphoris. \"Sir, it\u0027s us, Biff and Joshua. Remember? The kid from the bread?\" The soldier moved closer, his hand on the haft of his half-drawn short sword. When he saw Joshua he relaxed a bit. \"What are you doing here so early? No one is to be about at this hour.\" Suddenly, the soldier was yanked backward off of his feet and a dark figure fell on him, thrusting a blade into his chest over and over. Maggie screamed and the figure turned to us. I started to run. \"Stop,\" the murderer hissed. I froze. Maggie threw her arms around me and hid her face in my shirt as I trembled. A gurgling sound came from the soldier, but he lay still. Joshua made to step toward the murderer and I threw an arm across his chest to stop him. \"That was wrong,\" Joshua said, almost in tears. \"You are wrong to kill that man.\" The murderer held his bloody blade up by his face and grinned at us. \"Is it not written that Moses became a prophet only after killing an Egyptian slave driver? No master but God!\" \"Sicarii,\" I said. \"Yes boy, Sicarii. Only when the Romans are dead will the Messiah come to set us free. I serve God by killing this tyrant.\" \"You serve evil,\" Joshua said. \"The Messiah didn\u0027t call for the blood of this Roman.\" The assassin raised his blade and came at Joshua. Maggie and I leapt back, but Joshua stood his ground. The assassin grabbed him by the front of his shirt and pulled him close. \"What do you know of it, boy?\" We could clearly see the murderer\u0027s face in the moonlight. Maggie gasped, \"Jeremiah.\" His eyes went wide, with fear or recognition, I don\u0027t know which. He released Joshua and made as if to grab Maggie. I pulled her away. \"Mary?\" The anger had left his voice. \"Little Mary?\" Maggie said nothing, but I could feel her shoulders heave as she began to sob. \"Tell no one of this,\" the murderer said, now talking as if he were in a trance. He backed away and stood beside the dead soldier. \"No master but God,\" he said, then he turned and ran into the night. Joshua put his hand on Maggie\u0027s head and she immediately stopped crying. \"Jeremiah is my father\u0027s brother,\" she said. Before I go on you should know about the Sicarii, and to know about them, you have to know about the Herods. So here you go. About the time that Joshua and I were meeting for the first time, King Herod the Great died after ruling Israel (under the Romans) for over forty years. It was, in fact, the death of Herod that prompted Joseph to bring his family back to Nazareth from Egypt, but that\u0027s another story. Now you need to know about Herod. Herod wasn\u0027t called \"the Great\" because he was a beloved ruler. Herod the Great, was, in fact, a fat, paranoid, pox-ridden tyrant who murdered thousands of Jews, including his own wife and many of his sons. Herod was called \"the Great\" because he built things. Amazing things: fortresses, palaces, theaters, harbors - a whole city, Caesarea, modeled on the Roman ideal of what a city should be. The one thing he did for the Jewish people, who hated him, was to rebuild the Temple of Solomon on Mount Moriah, the center of our faith. When H. the G. died, Rome divided his kingdom among three of his sons, Archelaus, Herod Philip, and Herod Antipas. It was Antipas who ultimately passed sentence on John the Baptist and gave Joshua over to Pilate. Antipas, you sniveling fuckstick (if only we\u0027d had the word back then). It was Antipas whose toady pandering to the Romans caused bands of Jewish rebels to rise up in the hills by the hundreds. The Romans called all of these rebels Zealots, as if they were all united in method as well as cause, but, in fact, they were as fragmented as Jews of the villages. One of the bands that rose in Galilee called themselves the Sicarii. They showed their disapproval of Roman rule by the assassination of Roman soldiers and officials. Although certainly not the largest group of Zealots by number, they were the most conspicuous by their actions. No one knew where they came from, and no one knew where they went to after they killed, but every time they struck, the Romans did their best to make our lives hell to get us to give the killers up. And when the Romans caught a Zealot, they didn\u0027t just crucify the leader of the band, they crucified the whole band, their families, and anyone suspected of helping them. More than once we saw the road out of Sepphoris lined with crosses and corpses. My people. We ran through the sleeping city, stopping only after we had passed through the Venus Gate, where we fell in a heap on the ground, gasping. \"We have to take Maggie home and get back here for work,\" Joshua said. \"You can stay here,\" Maggie said. \"I can go by myself.\" \"No, we have to go.\" Joshua held his arms out to his sides and we saw the bloody handprints the killer had left on his shirt. \"I have to clean this before someone sees it.\" \"Can\u0027t you just make it go away?\" Maggie asked. \"It\u0027s just a stain. I\u0027d think the Messiah could get a stain out.\" \"Be nice,\" I said. \"He\u0027s not that good at Messiah stuff yet. It was your uncle, after all...\" Maggie jumped to her feet. \"You were the one who wanted to do this stupid thing...\" \"Stop!\" Joshua said, holding his hand up as if he were sprinkling us with silence. \"If Maggie hadn\u0027t been with us, we might be dead now. We may still not be safe when the Sicarii realize that three witnesses live.\" An hour later Maggie was home safe and Joshua emerged from the ritual bath outside the synagogue, his clothes soaked and rivulets running out of his hair. (Many of us had these mikvehs outside of our homes - and there were hundreds outside the Temple in Jerusalem - stone pits with steps leading down both sides into the water so one might walk in over one\u0027s head on one side, then out on the other after the ritual cleansing was done. According to the Law, any contact with blood called for a cleansing. Joshua thought it would be a good opportunity to scrub the stain out of his shirt as well.) \"Cold.\" Joshua was shivering and hopping from foot to foot as if on hot coals. \"Very cold.\" (There was a small stone hut built over the baths so they never got the direct light of the sun, consequently they never warmed up. Evaporation in the dry Galilee air chilled the water even more.) \"Maybe you should come to my house. My mother will have a breakfast fire going by now, you can warm yourself.\" He wrung out the tail of his shirt and water cascaded down his legs. \"And how would I explain this?\" \"Uh, you sinned, had an emergency cleansing to do.\" \"Sinned? At dawn? What sin could I have done before dawn?\" \"Sin of Onan?\" I said. Joshua\u0027s eyes went wide. \"Have you committed the sin of Onan?\" \"No, but I\u0027m looking forward to it.\" \"I can\u0027t tell your mother that I\u0027ve committed the sin of Onan. I haven\u0027t.\" \"You could if you\u0027re fast.\" \"I\u0027ll suffer the cold,\" Joshua said. The good old sin of Onan. That brings back memories. The sin of Onan. Spilling the old seed on the ground. Cuffing the camel. Dusting the donkey. Flogging the Pharisee. Onanism, a sin that requires hundreds of hours of practice to get right, or at least that\u0027s what I told myself. God slew Onan for spilling his seed on the ground (Onan\u0027s seed, not God\u0027s. God\u0027s seed turned out to be my best pal. Imagine the trouble you\u0027d be in if you actually spilled God\u0027s seed. Try explaining that). According to the Law, if you had any contact with \"nocturnal emissions\" (which are not what come out of your tailpipe at night - we didn\u0027t have cars then), you had to purify yourself by baptism and you weren\u0027t allowed to be around people until the next day. Around the age of thirteen I spent a lot of time in and out of our mikveh, but I fudged on the solitary part of penance. I mean, it\u0027s not like that was going to help the problem. Many a morning I was still dripping and shivering from the bath when I met Joshua to go to work. \"Spilled your seed upon the ground again?\" he\u0027d ask. \"Yep.\" \"You\u0027re unclean, you know?\" \"Yeah, I\u0027m getting all wrinkly from purifying myself.\" \"You could stop.\" \"I tried. I think I\u0027m being vexed by a demon.\" \"I could try to heal you.\" \"No way, Josh, I\u0027m having enough trouble with laying on of my own hands.\" \"You don\u0027t want me to cast out your demon?\" \"I thought I\u0027d try to exhaust him first.\" \"I could tell the scribes and they would have you stoned.\" (Always trying to be helpful, Josh was.) \"That would probably work, but it is written that \u0027when the oil of the lamp is used up, the wanker shall light his own way to salvation.\u0027\" \"That is not written.\" \"It is too. In, uh, Isaiah.\" \"Is not.\" \"You need to study your Prophets, Josh. How are you going to be the Messiah if you don\u0027t know your Prophets?\" Joshua hung his head. \"You are right, of course.\" I clapped him on the shoulder. \"You\u0027ll have time to learn the Prophets. Let\u0027s cut through the square and see if there are any girls gathering water.\" Of course it was Maggie I was looking for. It was always Maggie. By the time we got back to Sepphoris the sun was well up, but the stream of merchants and farmers that normally poured through the Venus Gate was not there. Roman soldiers were stopping and searching everyone who was trying to leave the city, sending them back the way they came. A group of men and women were waiting outside the gate to go in, my father and some of his helpers among them. \"Levi!\" my father called. He ran to us and herded us to the side of the road. \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked, trying to look innocent. \"A Roman soldier was murdered last night. There will be no work today, now you both go home and stay there. Tell your mothers to keep the children in today. If the Romans don\u0027t find the killer there\u0027ll be soldiers in Nazareth before noon.\" \"Where is Joseph?\" Joshua asked. My father put his arm around Joshua\u0027s shoulder. \"He\u0027s been arrested. He must have come to work very early. They found him at first light, near the body of the dead soldier. I only know what has been shouted from inside the gate, the Romans aren\u0027t letting anyone in or out of the city. Joshua, tell your mother not to worry. Joseph is a good man, the Lord will protect him. Besides, if the Romans thought he was the killer he would have been tried already.\" Joshua backed away from my father in stiff, stumbling steps. He stared straight ahead, but obviously saw nothing. \"Take him home, Biff. I\u0027ll be along as soon as I can. I\u0027m going to try to find out what they\u0027ve done with Joseph.\" I nodded and led Joshua away by the shoulders. When we were a few steps down the road, he said, \"Joseph came looking for me. He was working on the other side of the city. The only reason he was near the Greek\u0027s house is that he was looking for me.\" \"We\u0027ll tell the centurion we saw who killed the soldier. He\u0027ll believe us.\" \"And if he believes us, believes it was Sicarii, what will happen to Maggie and her family?\" I didn\u0027t know what to say. Joshua was right and my father was wrong, Joseph was not fine. The Romans would be questioning him right now, maybe torturing him to find out who his accomplices were. That he didn\u0027t know anything would not save him. And a testimony from his son not only wouldn\u0027t save him, but would send more people to the cross to join him. Jewish blood was going to be spilled one way or the other over this. Joshua shook off my hands and ran off the road into an olive grove. I started to follow, but he suddenly spun on me and the fury of his gaze stopped me in midstride. \"Wait,\" he said. \"I need to talk to my father.\" I waited by the road for nearly an hour. When Joshua walked out of the olive grove he looked as if a shadow had fallen permanently on his face. \"I am lost,\" he said. I pointed over my shoulder. \"Nazareth that way, Sepphoris the other way. You\u0027re in the middle. Feel better?\" \"You know what I mean.\" \"No help from your father, then?\" I always felt strange asking about Joshua\u0027s prayers. You had to see him pray, especially in those days, before we had traveled. There was a lot of strain and trembling, like someone trying to force a fever to break by sheer will. There was no peace in it. \"I am alone,\" Joshua said. I punched him in the arm, hard. \"Then you didn\u0027t feel that.\" \"Ouch. What\u0027d you do that for?\" \"Sorry, no one around to answer you. You\u0027re soooooooo alone.\" \"I am alone!\" I wound up for a full-body-powered roundhouse punch. \"Then you won\u0027t mind if I smite the bejeezus out of you.\" He threw up his hands and jumped back. \"No, don\u0027t.\" \"So you\u0027re not alone?\" \"I guess not.\" \"Good, then wait here. I\u0027m going to go talk to your father myself.\" I tramped off into the olive grove. \"You don\u0027t have to go in there to talk to him. He is everywhere.\" \"Yeah, right, like you know. If he\u0027s everywhere then how are you alone?\" \"Good point.\" I left Joshua standing by the road and went off to pray. And thus did I pray: \"Heavenly Father, God of my father and my father\u0027s father, God of Abraham and Isaac, God of Moses, who did lead our people out of Egypt, God of David and Solomon - well, you know who you are. Heavenly Father, far be it from me to question your judgment, being as you are all powerful and the God of Moses and all of the above, but what exactly are you trying to do to this poor kid? I mean, he\u0027s your son, right? He\u0027s the Messiah, right? Are you pulling one of those Abraham faith-test things on him? In case you didn\u0027t notice, he\u0027s in quite a pickle here, having witnessed a murder and his stepfather under arrest by the Romans, and in all likelihood, a lot of our people, who you have mentioned on more than one occasion are your favorites and the chosen (and of which I am one, by the way) are going to be tortured and killed unless we - I mean he - does something. So, what I\u0027m saying here is, could you, much as you did with Samson when he was backed into a corner weaponless against the Philistines, throw the kid a bone here? \"With all due respect. Your friend, Biff. Amen.\" I was never very good at prayer. Storytelling, I\u0027m fine with. I, in fact, am the originator of a universal story that I know has survived to this time because I have heard it on TV. It begins: \"Two Jews go into a bar...\" Those two Jews? Me and Josh. No kidding. Anyway, I\u0027m not good at prayer, but before you think I was a little rough on God, there\u0027s another thing you need to know about my people. Our relationship with God was different from other people and their Gods. Sure there was fear and sacrifice and all, but essentially, we didn\u0027t go to him, he came to us. He told us we were the chosen, he told us he would help us to multiply to the ends of the earth, he told us he would give us a land of milk and honey. We didn\u0027t go to him. We didn\u0027t ask. And since he came to us, we figure we can hold him responsible for what he does and what happens to us. For it is written that \"he who can walk away, controls the deal.\" And if there\u0027s anything you learn from reading the Bible, it\u0027s that my people walked away a lot. You couldn\u0027t turn around that we weren\u0027t off in Babylon worshiping false gods, building false altars, or sleeping with unsuitable women. (Although the latter may be more of a guy thing than a Jewish thing.) And God pretty much didn\u0027t mind throwing us into slavery or simply massacring us when we did that. We have that kind of relationship with God. We\u0027re family. So I\u0027m not a prayer-master, so to speak, but that particular prayer couldn\u0027t have been that bad, because God answered. Well, he left me a message, anyway. As I emerged from the olive grove, Joshua held out his hand and said, \"God left a message.\" \"It\u0027s a lizard,\" I said. It was. Joshua was holding a small lizard in his outstretched hand. \"Yes, that\u0027s the message, don\u0027t you see?\" How was I to know what was going on? Joshua had never lied to me, never. So if he said that this lizard was a message from God, who was I to dispute him? I fell to my knees and bowed my head under Josh\u0027s outstretched hand. \"Lord have mercy on me, I was expecting a burning bush or something. Sorry. Really.\" Then to Josh, I said, \"I\u0027m not so sure you should take that seriously, Josh. Reptiles don\u0027t tend to have a great record for getting the message right. Like for instance, oh, let\u0027s see, that Adam and Eve thing.\" \"It\u0027s not that kind of message, Biff. My father hasn\u0027t spoken in words, but this message is as clear as if his voice had come down from the heavens.\" \"I knew that.\" I stood up. \"And the message is?\" \"In my mind. When you had been gone only a few minutes this lizard ran up my leg and perched on my hand. I realized that it was my father giving me the solution to our problem.\" \"And the message is?\" \"You remember when we were little, the game we used to play with the lizards?\" \"Sure I do. But the message is?\" \"You remember how I was able to bring them back to life.\" \"A great trick, Josh. But getting back to the message...\" \"Don\u0027t you see? If the soldier isn\u0027t dead, then there was no murder. If there was no murder, then there is no reason for the Romans to harm Joseph. So all we have to do is see that the soldier is not dead. Simple.\" \"Of course, simple.\" I studied the lizard for a minute, looking at it from a number of different angles. It was brownish green and seemed quite content to sit there on Joshua\u0027s palm. \"Ask him what we\u0027re supposed to do now.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lamb-the-gospel-according-to-biff-christ-s-childhood-pal/page-5.html","bookId":2643,"book":{"id":2643,"title":"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ\u0027s Childhood Pal","description":"Storyline: A childhood pal of the savior is brought back from the dead to fill in the missing 30-year \"gap\" in the Gospels in Moore\u0027s latest, an over-the-top festival of sophomoric humor that stretches a very thin though entertaining conceit far past the breaking point.
