{"id":103520,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Chapter 25\n Philip, who was called the new guy, asked that we go to Cana by way of Bethany, as he had a friend there that he wanted to recruit to follow along with us. \"I tried to get him to join with John the Baptist,\" Philip said, \"but he wouldn\u0027t stand for the eating-locusts, living-in-pits thing. Anyway, he\u0027s from Cana, I\u0027m sure he\u0027d love to have a visit home.\"\n As we came into the square of Bethany, Philip called out to a blond kid who was sitting under a fig tree. He was the same yellow-haired kid that Joshua and I had seen when we first passed through Bethany over a year ago.\n \"Hey, Nathaniel,\" Philip called. \"Come join me and my friends on the way to Cana. They\u0027re from Nazareth. Joshua here might be the Messiah.\"\n \"Might be?\" I said.\n Nathaniel walked out into the street to look at us, shading his eyes against the sun. He couldn\u0027t have been more than sixteen or seventeen. He barely had the fuzz of a beard on his chin. \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" he said.\n \"Joshua, Biff, Bartholomew,\" Philip said, \"this is my friend Nathaniel.\"\n \"I know you,\" Joshua said. \"I saw you when we last passed through here.\"\n Then, inexplicably, Nathaniel fell to his knees in front of Joshua\u0027s camel and said, \"You are truly the Messiah and the Son of God.\"\n Joshua looked at me, then at Philip, then at the kid, prostrating himself on camel\u0027s feet. \"Because I\u0027ve seen you before you believe that I\u0027m the Messiah, even though a minute ago nothing good could come out of Nazareth?\"\n \"Sure, why not?\" said Nathaniel.\n And Josh looked at me again, as if I could explain it. Meanwhile Bartholomew, who was on foot along with his pack of doggie followers (whom he had disturbingly begun to refer to as his \"disciples\"), went over to Nathaniel and helped the boy to his feet. \"Stand up, if you\u0027re coming with us.\"\n Nathaniel prostrated himself before Bartholomew now. \"You are truly the Messiah and the Son of God.\"\n \"No, I\u0027m not,\" Bart said, lifting the kid to his feet. \"He is.\" Bart pointed to Joshua. Nathaniel looked to me, for some reason, for confirmation.\n \"You are truly a babe in the woods,\" I said to Nathaniel. \"You don\u0027t gamble, do you?\"\n \"Biff!\" Joshua said. He shook his head and I shrugged. To Nathaniel he said, \"You\u0027re welcome to join us. We share the camels, our food, and what little money we have.\" Here Joshua nodded toward Philip, who had been nominated to carry the communal purse because he was good at math.\n \"Thanks,\" said Nathaniel, and he fell in behind us.\n And thus we became five.\n \"Josh,\" I said in a harsh whisper, \"that kid is as dumb as a stick.\"\n \"He\u0027s not dumb, Biff, he just has a talent for belief.\"\n \"Fine,\" I said, turning to Philip. \"Don\u0027t let the kid anywhere near the money.\"\n As we headed out of the square toward the Mount of Olives, Abel and Crustus, the two old blind guys who\u0027d helped me over Maggie\u0027s wall, called out from the gutter. (I\u0027d learned their names after correcting their little gender mistake.)\n \"Oh son of David, have mercy on us!\"\n Joshua pulled up on the reins of his camel. \"What makes you call me that?\"\n \"You are Joshua of Nazareth, the young preacher who was studying under John?\"\n \"Yes, I am Joshua.\"\n \"We heard the Lord say that you were his son with whom he was well pleased.\"\n \"You heard that?\"\n \"Yes. About five or six weeks ago. Right out of the sky.\"\n \"Dammit, did everyone hear but me?\"\n \"Have mercy on us, Joshua,\" said one blind guy.\n \"Yeah, mercy,\" said the other.\n Then Joshua climbed down from his camel, laid his hands upon the old men\u0027s eyes, and said, \"You have faith in the Lord, and you have heard, as evidently everyone in Judea has, that I am his son with whom he is well pleased.\" Then he pulled his hands from their faces and the old men looked around.\n \"Tell me what you see,\" Joshua said.\n The old guys sort of looked around, saying nothing.\n \"So, tell me what you see.\"\n The blind men looked at each other.\n \"Something wrong?\" Joshua asked. \"You can see, can\u0027t you?\"\n \"Well, yeah,\" said Abel, \"but I thought there\u0027d be more color.\"\n \"Yeah,\" said Crustus, \"it\u0027s kind of dull.\"\n I stepped up. \"You\u0027re on the edge of the Judean desert, one of the most lifeless, desolate, hostile places on earth, what did you expect?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Crustus shrugged. \"More.\"\n \"Yeah, more,\" said Abel. \"What color is that?\"\n \"That\u0027s brown.\"\n \"How about that one?\"\n \"That would be brown as well.\"\n \"That color over there? Right there?\"\n \"Brown.\"\n \"You\u0027re sure that\u0027s not mauve.\"\n \"Nope, brown.\"\n \"And - \"\n \"Brown,\" I said.\n The two former blind guys shrugged and walked off mumbling to each other.\n \"Excellent healing,\" said Nathaniel.\n \"I for one have never seen a better healing,\" said Philip, \"but then, I\u0027m new.\"\n Joshua rode off shaking his head.\n When we came into Cana we were broke and hungry and more than ready for a feast, at least most of us were. Joshua didn\u0027t know about the feast. The wedding was being held in the courtyard of a very large house. We could hear the drums and singers and smell spiced meat cooking as we approached the gates. It was a large wedding and a couple of kids were waiting outside to tend to our camels. They were curly haired, wiry little guys about ten years old; they reminded me of evil versions of Josh and me at that age.\n \"Sounds like a wedding going on,\" Joshua said.\n \"Park your camel, sir?\" said the camel-parking kid.\n \"It is a wedding,\" said Bart. \"I thought we were here to help Maggie.\"\n \"Park your camel, sir?\" said the other kid, pulling on the reins of my camel.\n Joshua looked at me. \"Where is Maggie? You said she was sick?\"\n \"She\u0027s in the wedding,\" I said, pulling the reins back from the kid.\n \"You said she was dying.\"\n \"Well, we all are, aren\u0027t we? I mean, if you think about it.\" I grinned.\n \"You can\u0027t park that camel here, sir.\"\n \"Look, kid, I don\u0027t have any money to tip you. Go away.\" I hate handing my camel over to the camel-parking kids. It unnerves me. I\u0027m always sure that I\u0027m never going to see it again, or it\u0027s going to come back with a tooth missing or an eye poked out.\n \"So Maggie isn\u0027t really dying?\"\n \"Hey, guys,\" Maggie said, stepping out of the gate.\n \"Maggie,\" Joshua said, throwing his arms up in surprise. Problem was, he was so intent on looking at her that he forgot to grab on again, and off the camel he went. He hit the ground facedown with a thump and a wheeze. I jumped down from my camel, Bart\u0027s dogs barked, Maggie ran to Josh, rolled him over, and cradled his head in her lap while he tried to get his breath back. Philip and Nathaniel waved to people from the wedding who were peeping through the gate to see what all the commotion was about. Before I had a chance to turn, the two kids had leapt up onto our camels and were galloping around the corner off to Nod, or South Dakota, or some other place I didn\u0027t know the location of.\n \"Maggie,\" Joshua said. \"You\u0027re not sick.\"\n \"That depends,\" she said, \"if there\u0027s any chance of a laying on of hands.\"\n Joshua smiled and blushed. \"I missed you.\"\n \"Me too,\" Maggie said. She kissed Joshua on the lips and held him there until I started to squirm and the other disciples started to clear their throats and bark \"get a room\" under their breaths.\n Maggie stood up and helped Joshua to his feet. \"Come on in, guys,\" she said. \"No dogs,\" she said to Bart, and the hulking Cynic shrugged and sat down in the street amid his canine disciples.\n I was craning my neck to see if I could see where our camels had been taken. \"They\u0027re going to run those camels into the ground, and I know they won\u0027t feed or water them.\"\n \"Who?\" asked Maggie.\n \"Those camel-parking boys.\"\n \"Biff, this is my youngest brother\u0027s wedding. He couldn\u0027t even afford wine. He didn\u0027t hire any camel-parking boys.\"\n Bartholomew stood and rallied his troops. \"I\u0027ll find them.\" He lumbered off.\n Inside we feasted on beef and mutton, all manner of fruits and vegetables, bean and nut pastes, cheese and first-pressed olive oil with bread. There was singing and dancing and if it hadn\u0027t been for a few old guys in the corner looking very cranky, you\u0027d never have known that there wasn\u0027t any wine at the party. When our people danced, they danced in large groups, lines and circles, not couples. There were men\u0027s dances and women\u0027s dances and very few dances where both could participate, which is why people were staring at Joshua and Maggie as they danced. They were definitely dancing together.\n I retreated to a corner where I saw Maggie\u0027s sister Martha watching as she nibbled at some bread with goat cheese. She was twenty-five, a shorter, sturdier version of Maggie, with the same auburn hair and blue eyes, but with less tendency to laugh. Her husband had divorced her for \"grievous skankage\" and now she lived with her older brother Simon in Bethany. I\u0027d gotten to know her when we were little and she took messages to Maggie for me. She offered me a bite of her bread and cheese and I took it.\n \"She\u0027s going to get herself stoned,\" Martha said in a slightly bitter, moderately jealous, younger sister tone. \"Jakan is a member of the Sanhedrin.\"\n \"Is he still a bully?\"\n \"Worse, now he\u0027s a bully with power. He\u0027d have her stoned, just to prove that he could do it.\"\n \"For dancing? Not even the Pharisees - \"\n \"If anyone saw her kiss Joshua, then...\"\n \"So how are you?\" I said, changing the subject.\n \"I\u0027m living with my brother Simon now.\"\n \"I heard.\"\n \"He\u0027s a leper.\"\n \"Look, there\u0027s Joshua\u0027s mother. I have to go say hello.\"\n \"There\u0027s no wine at this wedding,\" Mary said.\n \"I know. Strange, isn\u0027t it?\"\n James stood by scowling as I hugged his mother.\n \"Joshua is here too?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Oh good, I was afraid that you two might have been arrested along with John.\"\n \"Pardon me?\" I stepped back and looked to James for explanation. He seemed the more appropriate bearer of bad news.\n \"You hadn\u0027t heard? Herod has thrown John in prison for inciting people to revolt. That\u0027s the excuse anyway. It\u0027s Herod\u0027s wife who wanted John silenced. She was tired of having John\u0027s followers refer to her as \u0027the slut.\u0027\"\n I patted Mary\u0027s shoulder as I stepped away. \"I\u0027ll tell Joshua that you\u0027re here.\"\n I found Joshua sitting in a far corner of the courtyard playing with some children. One little girl had brought her pet rabbit to the wedding and Joshua was holding it in his lap, petting its ears.\n \"Biff, come feel how soft this bunny is.\"\n \"Joshua, John has been arrested.\"\n Josh slowly handed the bunny back to the little girl and stood. \"When?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure. Shortly after we left, I guess.\"\n \"I shouldn\u0027t have left him. I didn\u0027t even tell him we were leaving.\"\n \"It was bound to happen, Joshua. I told him to lay off Herod, but he wouldn\u0027t listen. You couldn\u0027t have done anything.\"\n \"I\u0027m the Son of God, I could have done something.\"\n \"Yeah, you could have gone to prison with him. Your mother is here. Go talk to her. She\u0027s the one that told me.\"\n As Joshua embraced Mary, she said, \"You\u0027ve got to do something about this wine situation. Where\u0027s the wine?\"\n James tapped Joshua on the shoulder. \"Didn\u0027t bring any wine with you from the lush vineyards of Jericho?\" (I didn\u0027t like hearing sarcasm being used by James against Joshua. I had always thought of my invention as being used for good, or at least against people I didn\u0027t like.)\n Joshua gently pushed his mother away. \"You shall have wine,\" he said, then he went off to the side of the house where drinking water was stored in large stone jars. In a few minutes he returned with a pitcher of wine and cups for all of us. A shout went through the party and suddenly everything seemed to step up a level. Pitchers and cups were filled and drained and filled again, and those who had been near the wine jars started declaring a miracle had been performed, that Joshua of Nazareth had turned water into wine. I looked for him, but he was nowhere to be found. Having been free of sin all of his life, Joshua wasn\u0027t very good at dealing with guilt, so he had gone off by himself to try to numb the guilt he felt over John\u0027s arrest.\n After a few hours of subterfuge and guile, I was able to get Maggie to sneak out the back gate with me.\n \"Maggie, come with us. You talked to Joshua. You saw the wine. He\u0027s the one.\"\n \"I\u0027ve always known he was the one, but I can\u0027t come with you. I\u0027m married.\"\n \"I thought you were going to be a fisherman.\"\n \"And I thought you were going to be a village idiot.\"\n \"I\u0027m still looking for a village. Look, get Jakan to divorce you.\"\n \"Anything he can divorce me for he can also kill me for. I\u0027ve seen him pass judgment on people, Biff. I\u0027ve seen him lead the mobs to the stonings. I\u0027m afraid of him.\"\n \"I learned to make poisons in the East.\" I raised my eyebrows and grinned. \"Huh?\"\n \"I\u0027m not going to poison my husband.\"\n I sighed, an exasperated sigh that I\u0027d learned from my mother. \"Then leave him and come away with us, far from Jerusalem where he can\u0027t reach you. He\u0027ll have to divorce you to save face.\"\n \"Why should I leave, Biff? So I can follow around a man who doesn\u0027t want me and wouldn\u0027t take me if he did?\"\n I didn\u0027t know what to say, I felt like knives were twisting in fresh wounds in my chest. I looked at my sandals and pretended to have something caught in my throat.\n Maggie stepped up, put her arms around me, and laid her head against my chest. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said.\n \"I know.\"\n \"I missed both of you, but I missed just you too.\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"I\u0027m not going to sleep with you.\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"Then please stop rubbing that against me.\"\n \"Sure,\" I said.\n Just then Joshua stumbled through the gate and crashed into us. We were able to catch ourselves and him before anyone fell. The Messiah was holding the little girl\u0027s pet bunny, hugging it to his cheek with the big back feet swinging free. He was gloriously drunk. \"Know what?\" Josh said. \"I love bunnies. They toil not, neither do they bark. Henceforth and from now on, I decree that whenever something bad happens to me, there shall be bunnies around. So it shall be written. Go ahead Biff, write it down.\" He waved to me under the bunny, then turned and started back through the gate. \"Where\u0027s the friggin\u0027 wine? I got a dry bunny over here!\"\n \"See,\" I said to Maggie, \"you don\u0027t want to miss out on that. Bunnies!\"\n She laughed. My favorite music.\n \"I\u0027ll get word to you,\" she said. \"Where will you be?\"\n \"I have no idea.\"\n \"I\u0027ll get word to you.\"\n It was midnight. The party had wound down and the disciples and I were sitting in the street outside of the house. Joshua had passed out and Bartholomew had put a small dog under his head for a pillow. Before he had left, James had made it abundantly clear that we weren\u0027t welcome in Nazareth.\n \"Well?\" said Philip. \"I guess we can\u0027t go back to John.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t find the camels,\" Bartholomew said.\n \"People teased me about my yellow hair,\" said Nathaniel.\n \"I thought you were from Cana,\" I said. \"Don\u0027t you have family we can stay with?\"\n \"Plague,\" said Nathaniel.\n \"Plague,\" we all said, nodding. It happens.\n \"You\u0027ll probably be needing these,\" came a voice out of the darkness. We all looked up to see a short but powerfully built man walking out of the darkness, leading our camels.\n \"The camels,\" said Nathaniel.\n \"My apologies,\" said the man, \"my brother\u0027s sons brought them home to us in Capernaum. I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s taken so long to get them back to you.\"\n I stood and he handed the camel\u0027s reins to me. \"They\u0027ve been fed and watered.\" He pointed to Joshua, who was snoring away on his terrier. \"Does he always drink like that?\"\n \"Only when a major prophet has been imprisoned.\"\n The man nodded. \"I heard what he did with the wine. They say he also healed a lame man in Cana this afternoon. Is that true?\"\n We all nodded.\n \"If you have no place to stay, you can come home with me to Capernaum for a day or two. We owe you at least that for taking your camels.\"\n \"We don\u0027t have any money,\" I said.\n \"Then you\u0027ll feel right at home,\" said the man. \"My name is Andrew.\"\n And so we became six. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lamb-the-gospel-according-to-biff-christ-s-childhood-pal/page-25.html","bookId":2643,"book":{"id":2643,"title":"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ\u0027s Childhood Pal","description":"Storyline: \n A childhood pal of the savior is brought back from the dead to fill in the missing 30-year \"gap\" in the Gospels in Moore\u0027s latest, an over-the-top festival of sophomoric humor that stretches a very thin though entertaining conceit far past the breaking point.
