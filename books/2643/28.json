{"id":103523,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"Chapter 28 Joshua\u0027s ministry was three years of preaching, sometimes three times a day, and although there were some high and low points, I could never remember the sermons word for word, but here\u0027s the gist of almost every sermon I ever heard Joshua give. You should be nice to people, even creeps. And if you: a) believed that Joshua was the Son of God (and) b) he had come to save you from sin (and) c) acknowledged the Holy Spirit within you (became as a little child, he would say)(and) d) didn\u0027t blaspheme the Holy Ghost (see c), then you would: e) live forever f) someplace nice g) probably heaven. However, if you: h) sinned (and/or) i) were a hypocrite (and/or) j) valued things over people (and) k) didn\u0027t do a, b, c, and d, then you were: l) fucked Which is the message that Joshua\u0027s father had given him so many years ago, and which seemed, at the time, succinct to the point of rudeness, but made more sense after you listened to a few hundred sermons. That\u0027s what he taught, that\u0027s what we learned, that\u0027s what we passed on to the people in the towns of Galilee. Not everybody was good at it, however, and some seemed to miss the point altogether. One day Joshua, Maggie, and I returned from preaching in Cana to find Bartholomew sitting by the synagogue at Capernaum, preaching the Gospel to a semicircle of dogs that sat around him. The dogs seemed spellbound, but then, Bart was wearing a flank steak as a hat, so I\u0027m not sure it was his speaking skills that held their attention. Joshua snatched the steak off of Bartholomew\u0027s head and tossed it into the street, where a dozen dogs suddenly found their faith. \"Bart, Bart, Bart,\" Josh said as he shook the big man by the shoulders, \"don\u0027t give what\u0027s holy to dogs. Don\u0027t cast your pearls before swine. You\u0027re wasting the Word.\" \"I don\u0027t have any pearls. I am slave to no possessions.\" \"It\u0027s a metaphor, Bart,\" Joshua said, deadpan. \"It means don\u0027t give the Word to those who aren\u0027t ready to receive it.\" \"You mean like when you drowned the swine in Decapolis? They weren\u0027t ready for it?\" Joshua looked at me for help. I shrugged. Maggie said, \"That\u0027s exactly right, Bart. You got it.\" \"Oh, why didn\u0027t you say so?\" Bart said. \"Okay guys, we\u0027re off to preach the Word in Magdala.\" He climbed to his feet and led his pack of disciples toward the lake. Joshua looked at Maggie. \"That\u0027s not what I meant at all.\" \"Yes it is,\" she said, then she took off to find Johanna and Susanna, two women who had joined us and were learning to preach the gospel. \"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" Joshua said to me. \"Have you ever won an argument with her?\" He shook his head. \"Then say amen and let\u0027s go see what Peter\u0027s wife has cooked up.\" The disciples were gathered around outside of Peter\u0027s house, sitting on the logs we had arranged in a circle around a fire pit. They were all looking down and seemed to be caught in some glum prayer. Even Matthew was there, when he should have been at his job collecting taxes in Magdala. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" asked Joshua. \"John the Baptist is dead,\" said Philip. \"What?\" Joshua sat down on the log next to Peter and leaned against him. \"We just saw Bartholomew,\" I said. \"He didn\u0027t say anything about it.\" \"We just found out,\" said Andrew. \"Matthew just brought the news from Tiberius.\" It was the first time since he\u0027d joined us that I\u0027d seen Matthew without the light of enthusiasm in his face. He might have aged ten years in the last few hours. \"Herod had him beheaded,\" he said. \"I thought Herod was afraid of John,\" I said. It was rumored that Herod had kept John alive because he actually believed him to be the Messiah and was afraid of the wrath of God should the holy man perish. \"It was at the request of his stepdaughter,\" said Matthew. \"John was killed at the behest of a teenage slut.\" \"Well, jeez, if he wasn\u0027t dead already, the irony would have killed him,\" I said. Joshua stared into the dirt before him, thinking or praying, I couldn\u0027t tell. Finally he said, \"John\u0027s followers will be like babes in the wilderness.\" \"Thirsty?\" guessed Nathaniel. \"Hungry?\" guessed Peter. \"Horny?\" guessed Thomas. \"No, you dumbfucks, lost. They\u0027ll be lost!\" I said. \"Jeez.\" Joshua stood. \"Philip, Thaddeus, go to Judea, tell John\u0027s followers that they are welcome here. Tell them that John\u0027s work is not lost. Bring them here.\" \"But master,\" Judas said, \"John has thousands of followers. If they come here, how will we feed them?\" \"He\u0027s new,\" I explained. The next day was the Sabbath, and in the morning as we all headed to the synagogue, an old man in fine clothes ran out of the bushes and threw himself at Joshua\u0027s feet. \"Oh, Rabbi,\" he wailed, \"I am the mayor of Magdala. My youngest daughter has died. People say that you can heal the sick and raise the dead, will you help me?\" Joshua looked around. A half-dozen local Pharisees watched us from different points around the village. Joshua turned to Peter. \"Take the Word to the synagogue today. I am going to help this man.\" \"Thank you, Rabbi,\" the rich man gushed. He hurried off and waved for us to follow. \"Where are you taking us?\" I asked. \"Only as far as Magdala,\" he said. To Joshua I said, \"That\u0027s farther than a Sabbath\u0027s journey allows.\" \"I know,\" Joshua said. As we passed through all of the small villages along the coast on the way to Magdala, people came out of their houses and followed us for as long as they dared on a Sabbath, but I could also see the elders, the Pharisees, watching as we went. The mayor\u0027s house was large for Magdala, and his daughter had her own sleeping room. He led Joshua into the bedchamber where the girl lay. \"Please save her, Rabbi.\" Joshua bent down and examined the girl. \"Go out of here,\" he said to the old man. \"Out of the house.\" When the mayor was gone Joshua looked at me. \"She\u0027s not dead.\" \"What?\" \"This girl is sleeping. Maybe they\u0027ve given her some strong wine, or some sleeping powder, but she is not dead.\" \"So this is a trap?\" \"I didn\u0027t see this one coming either,\" Joshua said. \"They expect me to claim that I raised her from the dead, healed her, when she\u0027s only sleeping. Blasphemy and healing on the Sabbath.\" \"Let me raise her from the dead, then. I mean, I can do this one if she\u0027s only sleeping.\" \"They\u0027ll blame me for whatever you do as well. You may be their target too. The local Pharisees didn\u0027t devise this themselves.\" \"Jakan?\" Josh nodded. \"Go get the old man, and gather as many witnesses as you can, Pharisees as well. Make a ruckus.\" When I had about fifty people gathered in and around the house, Joshua announced, \"This girl isn\u0027t dead, she\u0027s sleeping, you foolish old man.\" Joshua shook the girl and she sat up rubbing her eyes. \"Keep watch on your strong wine, old man. Rejoice that you have not lost your daughter, but grieve that you have broken the Sabbath for your ignorance.\" Then Joshua stormed out and I followed him. When we were a ways down the street he said, \"Do you think they bought it?\" \"Nope,\" I said. \"Me either,\" Joshua said. In the morning a Roman soldier came to Peter\u0027s house with messages. I was still sleeping when I heard the shouting. \"I can only speak to Joshua of Nazareth,\" someone said in Latin. \"You\u0027ll speak to me or you\u0027ll never speak again,\" I heard someone else say. (Obviously someone who had no desire to live a long life.) I was up and running in an instant, my tunic waving unbelted behind me. I rounded the corner at Peter\u0027s house to see Judas facing down a legionnaire. The soldier had partially drawn his short sword. \"Judas!\" I barked. \"Back down.\" I put myself between them. I knew I could disarm the soldier easily, but not the legion that would follow him if I did. \"Who sends you, soldier?\" \"I have a message from Gaius Justus Gallicus, commander of the Sixth Legion, for Joshua bar Joseph of Nazareth.\" He glared at Judas over my shoulder. \"But there is nothing in my orders to keep me from killing this dog while delivering it.\" I turned to face Judas, whose face was on fire with anger. I knew he carried a dagger in his sash, although I hadn\u0027t told Joshua about it. \"Justus is a friend, Judas.\" \"No Roman is the friend of a Jew,\" said Judas, making no effort whatever to whisper. And at that point, realizing that Joshua hadn\u0027t reached our new Zealot recruit with the message of forgiveness for all men, and that he was going to get himself killed, I quickly reached up under Judas\u0027 tunic, clamped onto his scrotum, squeezed once, rapidly and extremely hard, and after he blasted a mouthful of slobber on my chest, his eyes rolled in his head and he slumped to his knees, unconscious. I caught him and lowered him to the ground so he didn\u0027t hit his head. Then I turned to the Roman. \"Fainting spells,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s go find Joshua.\" Justus had sent us three messages from Jerusalem: Jakan had indeed divorced Maggie; the Pharisees\u0027 full council had met and they were plotting to kill Joshua; and Herod Antipas had heard of Joshua\u0027s miracles and was afraid that he might be the reincarnation of John the Baptist. Justus\u0027 only personal note was one word: Careful. \"Joshua, you need to hide,\" said Maggie. \"Leave Herod\u0027s territory until things settle down. Go to Decapolis, preach to the gentiles. Herod Philip has no love for his brother, his soldiers won\u0027t bother you.\" Maggie had become a fiercely dedicated preacher herself. It was as if she had channeled her personal passion for Joshua into a passion for the Word. \"Not yet,\" said Joshua. \"Not until Philip and Thaddeus return with John\u0027s followers. I will not leave them lost. I need a sermon, one that can serve as if it was my last, one that will sustain the lost while I\u0027m gone. Once I deliver it to Galilee, I\u0027ll go to Philip\u0027s territory.\" I looked at Maggie and she nodded, as if to say, Do what you have to, but protect him. \"Let\u0027s write it then,\" I said. Like any great speech, the Sermon on the Mount sounds as if it just happened spontaneously, but actually Joshua and I worked on it for over a week - Joshua dictating and me taking notes on parchment. (I had invented a way of sandwiching a thin piece of charcoal between two pieces of olive wood so that I could write without carrying a quill and inkwell.) We worked in front of Peter\u0027s house, out in the boat, even on the mountainside where he would deliver the sermon. Joshua wanted to devote a long section of the sermon to adultery, largely, I realize now, motivated by my relationship with Maggie. Even though Maggie had resolved to stay celibate and preach the Word, I think Joshua wanted to drive the point home. Joshua said, \"Put in \u0027If a man even looks at a woman with lust in his heart, he has committed adultery.\u0027\" \"Really, you want to go with that? And this \u0027If a divorced woman remarries she commits adultery\u0027?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Seems a little harsh. A little Pharisee-ish.\" \"I had some people in mind. What do you have?\" \"\u0027Verily I say unto you\u0027 - I know you like to say \u0027verily\u0027 when you\u0027re talking about adultery - anyway, \u0027Verily I say unto you, that should a man put oil upon a woman\u0027s naked body, and make her go upon all fours and bark like a dog, while knowing her, if you know what I mean, then he has committed adultery, and surely if a woman do the same thing right back, well she has jumped on the adultery donkey cart herownself. And if a woman should pretend to be a powerful queen, and a man a lowly slave boy, and if she should call him humiliating names and make him lick upon her body, then surely they have sinned like big dogs - and woe unto the man if he pretends to be a powerful queen, and - \u0027\" \"That\u0027s enough, Biff.\" \"But you want to be specific, don\u0027t you. You don\u0027t want people to walk around wondering, \u0027Hey, is this adultery, or what? Maybe you should roll over.\u0027\" \"I\u0027m not sure that being that specific is a good idea.\" \"Okay, how \u0027bout this: \u0027Should a man or a woman have any goings-on with their mutual naughty bits, then it is more than likely they are committing adultery, or at least they should consider it.\u0027\" \"Well, maybe more specific than that.\" \"Come on, Josh, this isn\u0027t an easy one like \u0027Thou shalt not kill.\u0027 Basically, there you got a corpse, you got a sin, right?\" \"Yes, adultery can be sticky.\" \"Well, yes...Look, a seagull!\" \"Biff, I appreciate that you feel obliged to be an advocate for your favorite sins, but that\u0027s not what I need here. What I need is help writing this sermon. How we doing on the Beatitudes?\" \"Pardon me?\" \"The blesseds.\" \"We\u0027ve got: Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness; blessed are the poor in spirit, the pure in heart, the whiners, the meek, the - \" \"Wait, what are we giving the meek?\" \"Let\u0027s see, uh, here: Blessed are the meek, for to them we shall say, \u0027attaboy.\u0027\" \"A little weak.\" \"Yeah.\" \"Let\u0027s let the meek inherit the earth.\" \"Can\u0027t you give the earth to the whiners?\" \"Well then, cut the whiners and give the earth to the meek.\" \"Okay. Earth to the meek. Here we go. Blessed are the peacemakers, the mourners, and that\u0027s it.\" \"How many is that?\" \"Seven.\" \"Not enough. We need one more. How about the dumbfucks?\" \"No, Josh, not the dumbfucks. You\u0027ve done enough for the dumbfucks. Nathaniel, Thomas - \" \"Blessed are the dumbfucks for they, uh - I don\u0027t know - they shall never be disappointed.\" \"No, I\u0027m drawing the line at dumbfucks. Come on, Josh, why can\u0027t we have any powerful guys on our team? Why do we have to have the meek, and the poor, the oppressed, and the pissed on? Why can\u0027t we, for once, have blessed are the big powerful rich guys with swords?\" \"Because they don\u0027t need us.\" \"Okay, but no \u0027Blessed are the dumbfucks.\u0027\" \"Who then?\" \"Sluts?\" \"No.\" \"How about the wankers? I can think of five or six disciples that would be really blessed.\" \"No wankers. I\u0027ve got it: Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness\u0027 sake.\" \"Okay, better. What are you going to give them?\" \"A fruit basket.\" \"You can\u0027t give the meek the whole earth and these guys a fruit basket.\" \"Give them the kingdom of heaven.\" \"The poor in spirit got that.\" \"Everybody gets some.\" \"Okay then, \u0027share the Kingdom of Heaven.\u0027\" I wrote it down. \"We could give the fruit basket to the dumbfucks.\" \"NO DUMBFUCKS!\" \"Sorry, I just feel for them.\" \"You feel for everyone, Josh. It\u0027s your job.\" \"Oh yeah. I forgot.\" We finished writing the sermon only a few hours before Philip and Thaddeus returned from Judea leading three thousand of John\u0027s followers. Joshua had them gather on a hillside above Capernaum, then sent the disciples into the crowd to find the sick and bring them to him. He performed miracles of healing all morning, then coming into the afternoon he gathered us together at the spring below the mountain. Peter said, \"There\u0027s at least another thousand people from Galilee on the hill, Joshua, and they are hungry.\" \"How much food do we have?\" Joshua asked. Judas came forward with a basket. \"Five loaves and two fish.\" \"That will do, but you\u0027ll need more baskets. And about a hundred volunteers to help distribute the food. Nathaniel, you, Bartholomew, and Thomas go into the crowd and find me fifty to a hundred people who have their own baskets. Bring them here. By the time you get back we\u0027ll have the food for them.\" Judas threw down his basket. \"We have five loaves, how do you think - \" Joshua held up his hand for silence and the Zealot clammed up. \"Judas, today you\u0027ve seen the lame walk, the blind see, and the deaf hear.\" \"Not to mention the blind hear and the deaf see,\" I added. Joshua scowled at me. \"It will take little more to feed a few of the faithful.\" \"There are but five loaves!\" shouted Judas. \"Judas, once there was a rich man, who built great barns and granaries so he could save all of the fruits of his wealth long into his old age. But on the very day his barns were finished, the Lord said, \"Hey, we need you up here.\" And the rich man did say, \"Oh shit, I\u0027m dead.\" So what good did his stuff do him?\" \"Huh?\" \"Don\u0027t worry about what you\u0027re going to eat.\" Nathaniel, Bart, and Thomas started off to their assigned duty, but Maggie grabbed Nathaniel and held him fast. \"No,\" she said. \"No one does anything until you promise us that you\u0027ll go into hiding after this sermon.\" Joshua smiled. \"How can I hide, Maggie? Who will spread the Word? Who will heal the sick?\" \"We will,\" Maggie continued. \"Now promise. Go into the land of the gentiles, out of Herod\u0027s reach, just until things calm down. Promise or we don\u0027t move.\" Peter and Andrew stepped up behind Maggie to show their support. John and James were nodding as she spoke. \"So be it,\" said Joshua. \"But now we have hungry people to feed.\" And we fed them. The loaves and the fish were multiplied, jars were brought in from the surrounding villages and filled with water, which was carried to the mountainside, and all the while the local Pharisees watched and growled and spied, but they hadn\u0027t missed the healings, and they didn\u0027t miss the Sermon on the Mount, and word of it went back to Jerusalem with their poison reports. Afterward, at the spring by the shore, I gathered up the last of the pieces of bread to take home with us. Joshua came down the shore with a basket over his head, then pulled it off when he got to me. \"When we said we wanted you to hide we meant something a little less obvious, Joshua. Great sermon, by the way.\" Joshua started helping me gather up the bread that was strewn around on the ground. \"I wanted to talk to you and I couldn\u0027t get away from the crowd without hiding under the basket. I\u0027m having a little trouble preaching humility.\" \"You\u0027re so good at that one. People line up to hear the humility sermon.\" \"How can I preach that the humble will be exalted and the exalted will be humbled at the same time I\u0027m being exalted by four thousand people?\" \"Bodhisattva, Josh. Remember what Gaspar taught you about being a bodhisattva. You don\u0027t have to be humble, because you are denying your own ascension by bringing the good news to other people. You\u0027re out of the humility flow, so to speak.\" \"Oh yeah.\" He smiled. \"But now that you mention it,\" I said, \"it does seem a little hypocritical.\" \"I\u0027m not proud of that.\" \"Then you\u0027re okay.\" That evening, when we had all gathered again in Capernaum, Joshua called us to the fire ring in front of Peter\u0027s house and we watched the last gold of the sunlight reflecting on the lake as Joshua led us in a prayer of thanks. Then he made the call: \"Okay, who wants to be an apostle?\" \"I do, I do,\" said Nathaniel. \"What\u0027s an apostle?\" \"That\u0027s a guy who makes drugs,\" I said. \"Me, me,\" said Nathaniel. \"I want to make drugs.\" \"I\u0027ll try that,\" said John. \"That\u0027s an apothecary,\" said Matthew. \"An apothecary mixes powders and makes drugs. Apostle means \u0027to send off.\u0027\" \"Is this kid a whiz, or what,\" I said, pointing a thumb at Matthew. \"That\u0027s right,\" said Joshua, \"messengers. You\u0027ll be sent off to spread the message that the kingdom has come.\" \"Isn\u0027t that what we\u0027re doing now?\" asked Peter. \"No, now you\u0027re disciples, but I want to appoint apostles who will take the Word into the land. There will be twelve, for the twelve tribes of Israel. I\u0027ll give you power to heal, and power over devils. You\u0027ll be like me, only in a different outfit. You\u0027ll take nothing with you except your clothes. You\u0027ll live only off the charity of those you preach to. You\u0027ll be on your own, like sheep among wolves. People will persecute you and spit on you, and maybe beat you, and if that happens, well, it happens. Shake off the dust and move on. Now, who\u0027s with me?\" And there was a roaring silence among the disciples. \"How about you, Maggie?\" \"I\u0027m not much of a traveler, Josh. Makes me nauseous. Disciple\u0027s fine with me.\" \"How \u0027bout you, Biff?\" \"I\u0027m good. Thanks.\" Joshua stood up and just counted them off. \"Nathaniel, Peter, Andrew, Philip, James, John, Thaddeus, Judas, Matthew, Thomas, Bartholomew, and Simon. You\u0027re the apostles. Now get out there and apostilize.\" And they all looked at each other. \"Spread the good news, the son of man is here! The kingdom is coming. Go! Go! Go!\" They got up and sort of milled around. \"Can we take our wives?\" asked James. \"Yes.\" \"Or one of the women disciples?\" asked Matthew. \"Yes.\" \"Can Thomas Two go too?\" \"Yes, Thomas Two can go.\" Their questions answered, they milled around some more. \"Biff,\" Joshua said. \"Will you assign territories for everybody and send them out?\" \"Okey-dokey,\" I said. \"Who wants Samaria? No one? Good. Peter, it\u0027s yours. Give \u0027em hell. Caesarea? Come on, you weenies, step up...\" Thus were the twelve appointed to their sacred mission. The next morning seventy of the people who we\u0027d recruited to help feed the multitude came to Joshua when they heard about the appointing of the apostles. \"Why only twelve?\" one man asked. \"You all want to cast off what you own, leave your families, and risk persecution and death to spread the good news?\" Joshua asked. \"Yes,\" they all shouted. Joshua looked at me as if he himself couldn\u0027t believe it. \"It was a really good sermon,\" I said. \"So be it,\" said Joshua. \"Biff, you and Matthew assign territories. Send no one to his hometown. That doesn\u0027t seem to work very well.\" And so the twelve and the seventy were sent out, and Joshua, Maggie, and I went into Decapolis, which was the territory of Herod\u0027s brother, Philip, and camped and fished and basically hid out. Joshua preached a little, but only to small groups, and although he did heal the sick, he asked them not to tell anyone about the miracles. After three months hiding in Philip\u0027s territory, word came by boat from across the lake that someone had intervened on Joshua\u0027s behalf with the Pharisees and that the death warrant, which had never really been formal, had been lifted. We went home to Capernaum and waited for the apostles to return. Their enthusiasm had waned some after months in the field. \"It sucks.\" \"People are mean.\" \"Lepers are creepy.\" Matthew came out of Judea with more news of Joshua\u0027s mysterious benefactor from Jerusalem. \"His name is Joseph of Arimathea,\" said Matthew. \"He\u0027s a wealthy merchant, and he owns ships and vineyards and olive presses. He seems to have the ear of the Pharisees, but he is not one of them. His wealth has given him some influence with the Romans as well. They are considering making him a citizen, I hear.\" \"What makes him want to help us?\" I asked. \"I talked to him for a long time about the kingdom, and about the Holy Ghost and the rest of Joshua\u0027s message. He believes.\" Matthew smiled broadly, obviously proud of his powerful convert. \"He wants you to come to his house for dinner, Joshua. In Jerusalem.\" \"Are you sure it\u0027s safe for Joshua there?\" asked Maggie. \"Joseph has sent this letter guaranteeing Joshua\u0027s safety along with all who accompany him to Jerusalem.\" Matthew held out the letter. Maggie took the scroll and unrolled it. \"My name is on this too. And Biff\u0027s.\" \"Joseph knew you would be coming, and I told him that Biff sticks to Joshua like a leech.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"I mean, that you accompany the master wherever he travels,\" Matthew added quickly. \"But why me?\" Maggie asked. \"Your brother Simon who is called Lazarus, he is very sick. Dying. He\u0027s asked for you. Joseph wanted you to know that you would have safe passage.\" Josh grabbed his satchel and started walking that moment. \"Let\u0027s go,\" he said. \"Peter, you are in charge until I return. Biff, Maggie, we need to make Tiberius before dark. I\u0027m going to see if I can borrow some camels there. Matthew, you come too, you know this Joseph. And Thomas, you come along, I want to talk to you.\" So off we went, into what I was sure were the jaws of a trap. Along the way Joshua called Thomas to walk beside him. Maggie and I walked behind them only a few paces, so we could hear their conversation. Thomas kept stopping to make sure that Thomas Two could keep up with them. \"They all think I\u0027m mad,\" Thomas said. \"They laugh at me behind my back. Thomas Two has told me.\" \"Thomas, you know I can lay my hands upon you and you will be cured. Thomas Two will no longer speak to you. The others won\u0027t laugh at you.\" Thomas walked along for a while without saying anything, but when he looked back at Joshua I could see tears streaking his cheeks. \"If Thomas Two goes away, then I\u0027ll be alone.\" \"You won\u0027t be alone. You\u0027ll have me.\" \"Not for long. You don\u0027t have long with us.\" \"How do you know that?\" \"Thomas Two told me.\" \"We won\u0027t tell the others quite yet, all right, Thomas?\" \"Not if you don\u0027t want me to. But you won\u0027t cure me, will you? You won\u0027t make Thomas Two go away?\" \"No,\" Joshua said. \"We may both need an extra friend soon.\" He patted Thomas on the shoulder, then turned to walk on ahead to catch up with Matthew. \"Well, don\u0027t step on him!\" Thomas shouted. \"Sorry,\" said Joshua. I looked at Maggie. \"Did you hear that?\" She nodded. \"You can\u0027t let it happen, Biff. He doesn\u0027t seem to care about his own life, but I do, and you do, and if you let harm come to him I\u0027ll never forgive you.\" \"But Maggie, everyone is supposed to be forgiven.\" \"Not you. Not if something happens to Josh.\" \"So be it. So, hey, once Joshua heals your brother, you want to go do something, get some pomegranate juice, or a falafel, or get married or something?\" She stopped in her tracks, so I stopped too. \"Are you ever paying attention to anything that goes on around you?\" \"I\u0027m sorry, I was overcome by faith there for a moment. What did you say?\" When we got to Bethany, Martha was waiting for us in the street in front of Simon\u0027s house. She went right to Joshua and he held out his arms to embrace her, but when she got to him she pushed him away. \"My brother is dead,\" she said. \"Where were you?\" \"I came as soon as I heard.\" Maggie went to Martha and held her as they both cried. The rest of us stood around feeling awkward. The two old blind guys, Crustus and Abel, whom Joshua had once healed, came over from across the street. \"Dead, dead and buried four days,\" said Crustus. \"He turned a sort of chartreuse at the end.\" \"Emerald, it was emerald, not chartreuse,\" said Abel. \"My friend Simon truly sleeps, then,\" Joshua said. Thomas came up and put his hand on Joshua\u0027s shoulder. \"No, master, he\u0027s dead. Thomas Two thinks it may have been a hairball. Simon was a leopard, you know?\" I couldn\u0027t stand it. \"He was a LEPER, you idiot! Not a leopard.\" \"Well, he IS dead!\" shouted Thomas back. \"Not sleeping.\" \"Joshua was being figurative, he knows he\u0027s dead.\" \"Do you guys think you could be just a little more insensitive?\" said Matthew, pointing to the weeping sisters. \"Look, tax collector, when I want your two shekels I\u0027ll ask - \" \"Where is he?\" Joshua asked, his voice booming over the sobs and protests. Martha pushed out of her sister\u0027s embrace and looked at Joshua. \"He bought a tomb in Kidron,\" said Martha. \"Take me there, I need to wake my friend.\" \"Dead,\" said Thomas. \"Dead, dead, dead.\" There was a sparkle of hope amid the tears in Martha\u0027s eyes. \"Wake him?\" \"Dead as a doornail. Dead as Moses. Mmmph...\" Matthew clamped his hand over Thomas\u0027s mouth, which saved me having to render the twin unconscious with a brick. \"You believe that Simon will rise from the dead, don\u0027t you?\" asked Joshua. \"In the end, when the kingdom comes, and everyone is raised, yes, I believe.\" \"Do you believe I am who I say I am?\" \"Of course.\" \"Then show me where my friend lies sleeping.\" Martha moved like a sleepwalker, her exhaustion and grief driven back just enough for her to lead us up the road to the Mount of Olives and down into the Kidron Valley. Maggie had been deeply shaken by the news of her brother\u0027s death as well, so Thomas and Matthew helped her along while I walked with Joshua. \"Four days dead, Josh. Four days. Divine Spark or not, the flesh is empty.\" \"Simon will walk again if he is but bone,\" said Joshua. \"Okey-dokey. But this has never been one of your better miracles.\" When we got to the tomb there was a tall, thin, aristocratic man sitting outside eating a fig. He was clean-shaven and his gray hair was cut short like a Roman\u0027s. If he hadn\u0027t worn the two-striped tunic of a Jew I would have thought him a Roman citizen. \"I thought you would come here,\" he said. He knelt before Joshua. \"Rabbi, I\u0027m Joseph of Arimathea. I sent word through your disciple Matthew that I wanted to meet with you. How may I serve?\" \"Stand up, Joseph. Help roll away this stone.\" As with many of the larger tombs carved into the side of the mountain, there was a large flat stone covering the doorway. Joshua put his arms around Maggie and Martha while the rest of us wrestled with the stone. As soon as the seal was broken I was hit with a stench that gagged me and Thomas actually lost his supper in the dirt. \"He stinks,\" said Matthew. \"I thought he would smell more like a cat,\" said Thomas. \"Don\u0027t make me come over there, Thomas,\" I said. We pushed the stone as far as it would go, then we ran away gasping for fresh air. Joshua held his arms out as if waiting to embrace his friend. \"Come out, Simon Lazarus, come out into the light.\" Nothing but stench came out of the tomb. \"Come forth, Simon. Come out of that tomb,\" Joshua commanded. And absolutely nothing happened. Joseph of Arimathea shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot. \"I wanted to talk to you about the dinner at my house before you got there, Joshua.\" Joshua held up his hand for silence. \"Simon, dammit, come out of there.\" And ever so weakly, there came a voice from inside the tomb. \"No.\" \"What do you mean, \u0027no\u0027? You have risen from the dead, now come forth. Show these unbelievers that you have risen.\" \"I believe,\" I said. \"Convinced me,\" said Matthew. \"A no is as good as a personal appearance, as far as I\u0027m concerned,\" said Joseph of Arimathea. I\u0027m not sure any of us who had smelled the stench of rotting flesh really wanted to see the source. Even Maggie and Martha seemed a little dubious about their brother\u0027s coming out. \"Simon, get your leprous ass out here,\" Joshua commanded. \"But I\u0027m...I\u0027m all icky.\" \"We\u0027ve all seen icky before,\" said Joshua. \"Now come out into the light.\" \"My skin is all green, like an unripe olive.\" \"Olive green!\" declared Crustus, who had followed us into Kidron. \"I told you it wasn\u0027t chartreuse.\" \"What the hell does he know? He\u0027s dead,\" said Abel. Finally Joshua lowered his arms and stormed into the tomb. \"I can\u0027t believe that you bring a guy back from the dead and he doesn\u0027t even have the courtesy to come out - WHOA! HOLY MOLY!\" Joshua came backing out of the tomb, stiff-legged. Very calmly and quietly, he said, \"We need clean clothes, and some water to wash with, and bandages, lots of bandages. I can heal him, but we have to sort of get all of his parts stuck back together first.\" \"Hold on, Simon,\" Joshua shouted to the tomb, \"we\u0027re getting some supplies, then I\u0027ll come in and heal your affliction.\" \"What affliction?\" asked Simon.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lamb-the-gospel-according-to-biff-christ-s-childhood-pal/page-28.html","bookId":2643,"book":{"id":2643,"title":"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ\u0027s Childhood Pal","description":"Storyline: A childhood pal of the savior is brought back from the dead to fill in the missing 30-year \"gap\" in the Gospels in Moore\u0027s latest, an over-the-top festival of sophomoric humor that stretches a very thin though entertaining conceit far past the breaking point. The action starts in modern America, specifically in a room at the Hyatt in St. Louis, where the angel who shepherds \"Levi who is called Biff\" has to put Christ\u0027s outrageous sidekick under de facto house arrest to get him to complete his task.
