{"id":42663,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V.","content":"Sir John Wetheral\u0027s conference with Julia was of long duration, for he found her prepared with a hundred arguments, which bore down every objection: it was Samson stoning the Philistine, and every blow told upon her antagonist. It was in vain he urged Julia to pause ere she committed herself, and became the wife of a sickly husband. \"My child, consider your own health, and the health of the unborn: beware of undertaking the situation of nurse at your age, and subjecting yourself to the irritable chidings of a man weighed down with disease, and prostrated in mind by its effects.\" \"My dear papa, that is one material reason for my acceptance; I am very much interested in poor Lord Ennismore\u0027s sufferings, and you [102] would not wish me to desert an unfortunate man because Providence has afflicted him.\" \"You cannot be aware of its results, Julia.\" \"Oh! papa, I am perfectly aware of all consequences, and fully prepared to meet them. Lord Ennismore is ill—I will nurse him. He is irritable, I know, but I will bear with him.\" \"I will not press his health, Julia, as the most objectionable point; there are still more powerful ones. I consider Lord Ennismore\u0027s intellect enfeebled by disease, and his temper affected too strongly for your happiness.\" \"I do not consider his intellects below par, papa: Tom Pynsent is ten times louder, and less agreeable than Lord Ennismore: there must be some disagreeables in every body.\" \"Lord Ennismore\u0027s mind is not a gentlemanly mind, Julia; I have observed his actions and sentiments. He is exclusively selfish: a selfish man can never be an agreeable companion for a young wife.\" \"Time will improve him in that respect, papa. I do not see how Lord Ennismore\u0027s selfish feelings can interfere with me; his fortune will command any wishes he may form; I shall not oppose them. As to his temper, I shall neither [103] see nor hear its display; he must be selfish and violent with his servants.\" \"And are these the notions you seriously entertain with respect to matrimony, Julia?\" \"My notions, papa, are really serious, and I know I shall find them serviceable. I have quite made up my mind to marry Lord Ennismore, and say now, papa, you do not object. Mamma says you will not and cannot object to a match so splendid; now, papa, say yes, and don\u0027t fidget about ill-health and temper.\" Julia took her father\u0027s hand, and kissed it with a gaiety altogether astonishing. Sir John smiled at the action, and involuntarily drew her towards him. Julia took advantage of the movement. \"That\u0027s my dear, good papa, I knew you meant to give me pleasure: silence is more expressive than words, and I am Lady Ennismore in prospect, am I not?\" \"I offer you counsel, my dear girl,\" replied her father, gently and gravely, \"I can do no more; the world may suppose you high and happy, but, mark me, Julia, you will be the veriest wretch on earth if you marry Ennismore, and, at that moment, my advice will be useless, and my presence impossible—a husband commands [104] you, and supersedes your father. Listen to me, Julia: Ennismore is governed by his imperious and overbearing mother, whose wishes are masked by apparent mildness and great fascination of manner.\" \"A mother\u0027s influence must give way to that of a wife,\" exclaimed Julia, earnestly. \"Lady Ennismore\u0027s influence will give way to no one, and you must succumb to its power if you hope for peace. Her stronghold is the very selfishness she has fostered in her son: all his intentions, every word and action of his, have reference to his mother, who has so long ministered to his besetting sin.\" \"I flatter myself I shall be able to compete with my husband\u0027s mother,\" said Julia, in a tone slightly tinged with contempt. \"I should consider myself strangely altered, if my husband turned from me, to consult his mother. No, papa, I have no fear of that insult—Ennismore has too much affection for me.\" \"Ennismore is not capable of affection, Julia.\" \"Well, papa, you are saying the most unkind things possible of Lord Ennismore, and, indeed, excuse me if I say you are quite wrong in accusing [105] him of want of affection.\" A burst of tears followed poor Julia\u0027s hurried speech. Sir John again repeated his strong objections to the match, and endeavoured to point out the fallacy of attempting to win Lord Ennismore\u0027s confidence—the confidence of a man whose mind nearly approached to imbecility, but who was linked to his mother by the strong force of long habit; and her control over his actions, fixed by constant and unceasing attention to his selfish wants. In vain he placed before his daughter\u0027s mind the misery she must endure when the veil should be torn from her eyes, and she woke to the certainty of being united for life to a man she despised—a man inferior to herself in head and heart, yet possessing neither respect nor affection for the woman he had married. In vain he painted her longing for the home she had quitted, when all its pleasures, its tranquillity, would be of no avail; when she could never more claim or enjoy them—all was in vain! Julia could not, would not, admit a doubt of her power over Ennismore\u0027s heart, and she disclaimed all observations relative to the weakness of his capacity. \"It was easy enough,\" she said, \"to fix incapacity [106] upon a young man whom Providence had afflicted with illness, but the proof was insufficient. She would rather say Providence had raised her up to watch over Lord Ennismore, and smooth the rough path he was destined to tread: certainly every disagreeable remark that could be devised was brought up in array before her, yet she could not feel alarmed: she was prepared to meet the trials which her mamma told her belonged to matrimony, especially where poverty presided: poverty would not be the case in this instance, and she must be allowed to say she could not resign Lord Ennismore upon what had been alleged against him. If her papa positively forbade the match, she would submit, but nothing short of his decided prohibition would induce her to renounce a man she liked and approved. \"I would rather follow you to the grave, Julia, than see you the wife of Ennismore!\" exclaimed her father. \"The grave, then, papa, will be my portion, if you are determined to be unkind to poor Lord Ennismore, whom you invited yourself to Wetheral.\" The father was moved: true, his own hand had penned the invitation, and it availed nothing that [107] such a step had been taken against his own better judgment. He had brought the evil to his own door, and the consequence was falling upon him even now. Julia perceived her advantage, and again, in gentle entreaty, besought his consent to her marriage. Self-accusation softened her father\u0027s heart, as he viewed Julia pleading for a destiny his own error had prepared, and she wrung from his lips a slow and reluctant assent. \"You have forced me, Julia, to say words which will seal both our misery,\" he said, as Julia clung fondly round him, \"and you will one day upbraid me for my weakness.\" \"Never, dear papa, never! you cannot know Lord Ennismore as I know him; and, in days to come, you will smile at the list of grievances you brought against that poor, suffering, innocent creature.\" \"I have done that which I shall repent of for ever, Julia; but I yet tell you my judgment has yielded to affection. I warn you to pause ere you marry a man your father disapproves—before you commit your peace of mind into the hands of a selfish-hearted husband—before you quit for ever the home which shelters you! You have drawn from me an unwilling consent, because [108] I cannot give pain—because I have myself drawn this blank, for I allowed the intimacy; but, Julia, I have said, and I say again, I do not like the man.\" \"You have said every thing, papa, to dissuade me, and upon me be the misery you suggest, and which I cannot believe will arise from my marriage with Lord Ennismore. Think no more of me, papa, and do not reproach yourself for having made me happy. A few months will prove the mistake of your statements, and you will rejoice in having given me to Ennismore: indeed, papa, you will!\" and Julia stroked his hand with a smile so bright, and eyes sparkling with such deep happiness, that her father could only feel it impossible to check her dream of hope. Lady Wetheral at that moment opened the door. \"What an eternity of time you have been closeted! I fancied something was wrong, and a mother\u0027s feelings are uncontrollable: ah, Julia, I see all is right by your bright eyes—I see \u0027trousseau\u0027 written legibly on your forehead, and a splendid one it will prove, I am sure. Of course, Lady Ennismore must have family jewels, which she will present to you. I will resign mine with [109] pleasure, that my daughter Ennismore may appear in great brilliance.\" \"You have other daughters, Gertrude,\" said Sir John, gravely. \"But none, love, that are likely to marry peers. Anna Maria, I am sure, will not marry now: she has let every opportunity pass by. Clara is beautiful, but peers are not plentiful in our neighbourhood. Perhaps a season at Cheltenham—. But where is Lord Ennismore, Julia? Let me congratulate and receive my son: I always admired and thought well of dear Ennismore: indeed, I may consider it quite my own match, for you know, Julia, I always said he must be my son-in-law!\" Lord Ennismore was sought by Julia, and presented in form, to receive each parent\u0027s benediction: it was distinctly uttered by Sir John Wetheral, and formed a strong contrast to his lady\u0027s melodious and \"holyday\" terms. As Lord Ennismore advanced, his attenuated form, pallid countenance, and lack-lustre grey eyes, struck Sir John\u0027s mind with disgust and regret, which he could with difficulty repress. \"My lord, I am called upon, by my daughter Julia, to accept you as a near relation. I have [110] stated my sentiments to her freely; and as she allows no objections to take effect upon her own judgment, I have only to wish you happy in proportion to the kindness and indulgence you bestow upon your wife.\" Lady Wetheral saluted his lordship as a man of many virtues. \"My dearest lord, I cannot but felicitate myself and family upon our new and very dear accession to its number. If your health is preserved to us, we shall have no wish ungratified; and I trust my Julia will long enjoy the happiness which must arise from this grateful and flattering connexion.\" Lord Ennismore bowed to each, but not one ray of expression lighted up his heavy countenance, or ruffled the leaden stillness of his ensemble. Julia\u0027s smiling face lent increased dullness to her lover\u0027s looks as he spoke. \"I am very proud to meet your approbation, Sir John, and yours, Lady Wetheral; I expect my mother in a few days, who will arrange things for me. She wished me very much to marry, and I am sure Julia will be very happy in her acquaintance.\" \"I am sure I shall love her, Ennismore, if it was only for your sake,\" said Julia. [111] \"She manages every thing for me,\" replied his lordship, \"and I have nothing to do but amuse myself; I think she must be here on Wednesday, and then she will arrange all things for our marriage. I hope to receive you very soon at Bedinfield, Sir John, and you, Lady Wetheral; I shall have great pleasure in showing the lions there, and my mother will explain every thing to you.\" \"Oh! I look forward to that visit with such anxious pleasure, my dear lord!\" replied Lady Wetheral. \"I have heard so much of Bedinfield, so much of its magnificence, and so much more of the excellent taste displayed in its internal comforts! I shall, indeed, pay you and dear Julia a visit with pleasure, and I am sure with profit, for the elegances of Bedinfield will suggest many improvements for Wetheral.\" Lord Ennismore bowed repeatedly during Lady Wetheral\u0027s eulogium, and once more, when the eulogium closed:— \"My mother has done much towards beautifying the family estate; and I am sure your approbation will give her gratification, Lady Wetheral; as also yours, Sir John.\" Sir John bent forward, in token of polite notice, [112] but he remained silent; his lady had already poured forth a stream of compliment, sufficient for all the exigencies of the case. Lord Ennismore turned to Julia, and addressed her in his best and most prosy manner. \"I have happiness in thinking my mother will approve my choice; she has long proposed my marrying, and I am sure she will tell me I have done right. I will now despatch a letter to say I am accepted. I should not like the circumstance to transpire through any other means, and she will be then enabled to form her own plans for our future establishment. I am sure she will think I have done right.\" Thus did Julia become engaged to Lord Ennismore, and thus did she give herself away to a man perfectly disgusting, had he been unsupported by station and wealth. Sir John did not allude to the affair after he had undergone the painful task of accepting him in the light of a son; but Lady Wetheral did not affect to conceal the triumph of her heart; it revelled in her expression, and lighted up her countenance with unusual brilliance. Julia must be a peeress—the young and lovely Lady Ennismore!—had she now a wish ungratified?—all was absorbed in Julia. [113] Lady Ennismore\u0027s arrival broke through Lady Wetheral\u0027s day-dream, and demanded her attention; it was necessary for a time to generalize her feelings and thoughts; to withdraw them from resting exclusively on Julia, and to be again the polite and attractive hostess. The youthful peeress expectant had not attained her honours, and another personage was yet to be consulted and won. Lady Wetheral applied herself to her task with energy and tact. Lady Ennismore had been many years a widow, and her person retained a considerable portion of beauty and youthful appearance. Her manner was irresistible to those whom she considered it her interest to attach; to all it was fascinating; but to the very few who were destined to be near her, and who became the involuntary agents of her will, to them Lady Ennismore\u0027s seductive attractions became a spell, which none could withstand, and from whose magnetic influence no talisman could free their spirit. Lord Ennismore\u0027s thoughts and sentiments had their rise in his mother\u0027s suggestions, though he believed his actions to be the offspring of his own free will; but her ascendency, silent and wily in its nature, was deeply and immoveably [114] fixed in his mind—a wife might never hope to share it. Lady Wetheral could not equal her guest in diplomatic talents, but she followed Lady Ennismore\u0027s lead with excellent tact, and managed her husband\u0027s distaste to her ladyship, with great skill. The ladies became intimate upon their first meeting, and were rarely separate during Lady Ennismore\u0027s stay at Wetheral. Julia was soon bound heart and soul to her future mother-in-law; her young imagination speedily allowed every virtue to manners so flattering, and she believed herself captivated by excellence, and the irresistible force of kindness as sincere as it was delightful. Every member at Wetheral, save its proprietor, adored the amiable and conciliating Lady Ennismore. Lady Ennismore held an interesting conversation with her son, soon after her arrival at the castle. They were alone, in her ladyship\u0027s private sitting-room. \"My dear Ennismore, do you take your medicines regularly?\" \"Yes, I take three pills every night.\" \"And your powders, my love?\" \"Three times a day, just as I do at Bedinfield.\" [115] \"Julia is a sweet girl, Ennismore; I hope she will not forget your health, or overlook the necessity of attending to your medicines.\" \"I am sure she will be very attentive,\" replied his lordship, laying down the book of patterns, which he was copying for Clara. \"I am sure she means it, Ennismore; but a fine young creature like Julia may forget occasionally, and it is so necessary your system should be attended to.\" \"Julia says she shall seldom leave Bedinfield; therefore, all things will go on as regularly as usual.\" \"My dear Ennismore, Julia must go into public as your wife; she must be often in society, and she must receive company; her station in life requires some sacrifices, but, should you often be compelled to remain alone, I should be very anxious about your health. I hate the venal attentions of servants; they might poison you.\" \"But you will be with us?\" observed the young lord, in an anxious tone. \"My dear Ennismore, I would make any sacrifice to establish your comfort, but I dare say such a step is unnecessary. Julia is a dear, delightful [116] creature, just the very daughter-in-law I would have selected. I am sure her tenderest cares will be devoted to your health. If, in her gay or occupied hours, she should display an occasional oversight, remember her youth and beauty, and the difficulties of her situation, Ennismore.\" \"But who will attend to my medicines, and myself?\" asked his lordship; \"I never can be left alone, you know; who will play cribbage with me in the evenings, as you have always done?\" \"Leave that to me, my son; time and circumstance will do much for us. You have chosen the flower of the Wetherals for your wife. Julia loves me, and is guided by me in every thing which relates to yourself; Lady W. is a ladylike goose, and her eldest daughter resembles the automaton in stillness and insipidity. Clara is very handsome, but I see already the germs of violence in her temper. You have done very wisely in choosing Julia; between ourselves, she is easily guided by the person she loves, and she loves me for your sake, Ennismore.\" \"I am very glad I have given you satisfaction; altogether, I am greatly pleased I am [117] going to be married, since you like Julia, and wished me to settle. I am sure she is an excellent person, and will take great care of me, but I can\u0027t think I shall get on well without you, mother!\" \"My dear son, do you really wish to be plagued with a mother, when a young and handsome woman becomes your companion? Cannot you allow for a little present discomfort, till Julia becomes accustomed to your methods? Your poor fond mother will be a millstone round your neck, dear Augustus.\" \"I can never be happy without you, mother, to give me all my things in proper time. I have been so accustomed to have every thing done for me, and Julia cannot remember every thing at once, as you do. You will stay with us at Bedinfield?\" \"Your affection to me is extremely flattering, Ennismore, and your mother will never be far from you; but consider the opinion of the world, and, believe me, we must conform in some measure to its expectations. I will retire to my jointure-house with proper humility; how long I continue there, will depend upon yourself.\" [118] \"But Julia does not know my ways; who will give me my pills?\" \"Your young wife, Ennismore.\" \"Mother, I can\u0027t marry, unless you will stay by me, and take care of me, as you have always done. Julia does not know I take so much medicine; she knows nothing about illness; I always expected you would live with me when I married.\" \"You will be very happy at Bedinfield, Augustus, with Julia.\" \"I know I shall be very ill, mother.\" \"Hush!\" whispered her ladyship, as the door opened, and Julia appeared, fresh and fair as Venus, when she first presented her bright form before the admiring gods; the joyous expression of her face formed a painful contrast with the leaden torpidity of her lover\u0027s dreary countenance. \"I am come to announce another gay meeting at Lady Spottiswoode\u0027s this day week; all our party must, positively, attend, Lady Spottiswoode says, for her rooms are to boast particular attractions. The celebrated Adonis, Mr. Vyvyan, and the still more celebrated Captain Jekyl, are borrowed for the occasion. Here are notes for each, and all.\" [119] \"And who is Mr. Vyvyan, Julia?\" asked Lady Ennismore. \"Every body knows, or has heard of Captain Jekyl, but I am ignorant of the existence of Mr. Vyvyan; comes he from Cornwall?\" \"I do not know, but he is staying with the Pynsents, and every body is wild about him. You will obey the summons, dear Lady Ennismore?\" Her ladyship demurred. \"Oh, then, I shall have no pleasure in the thing at all,\" exclaimed Julia, \"and I am sure Ennismore will not care about it if you are absent; therefore, we will remain together at home.\" \"Dear flattering girl,\" said her ladyship, smiling, and pressing Julia\u0027s hand; \"am I so seriously included in your scheme of happiness? I will not hear of your absence from so much gaiety: now is the natural and proper period for enjoyment, Julia, and, since you are silly enough to prefer an old lady\u0027s society, I must and will with pleasure sacrifice my own wishes. I will attend you to Lady Spottiswoode\u0027s, and witness your triumphs.\" \"My greatest triumph will arise in having [120] won your consent to accompany us, dearest Lady Ennismore,\" replied Julia; and her beaming eyes proved the sincerity of her feelings. Julia, artless and affectionate, was incapable of disguise; and the parentally kind and watchful attention of her ladyship won the whole soul of the object to whom it was addressed. Julia rarely quitted the society of her future mother; and certainly her attachment amounted to adoration in its effects; but, little accustomed to expressions of regard and fondness from her own parent, and sensibly alive to kindness, no wonder the charm was felt, and its influence yielded to, by one so keenly feeling. The attachment of Lord Ennismore, however coldly manifested, and the fascinating sweetness of Lady Ennismore\u0027s manners, opened visions of happy futurity to Julia\u0027s mind; and she drank copiously of the cup of delightful hope presented to her lips. All was to her a scene of enchantment. Christobelle was now admitted to range freely through the apartments once so impervious to her sisters, till their fourteenth anniversary allowed them the entrée, in form, to the delights of society. Upon Julia\u0027s engagement to Lord Ennismore, Clara was inducted into her rights and privileges; [121] and Christobelle, under cover of her father\u0027s protection, was allowed to glide silently among the personages filling the present busy scene. Lady Wetheral was too much occupied in \"arrangements\" concerning the forthcoming marriage to heed her appearance; and if a kind remark from Lady Ennismore betrayed her presence, Lady Wetheral observed \"it was only Bell, Sir John\u0027s pet, and concern, altogether—not hers;\" and she was allowed to roam about unnoticed. \"Bell\" remembered, in after years, how Julia was evermore seated near Lady Ennismore, fixing her eyes in admiration upon her ladyship\u0027s fine countenance, and listening to her conversation with eager attention. She remembered Lord Ennismore employed almost constantly by Clara in copying music, or drawing patterns for fancy-work, and Miss Wetheral occupied in drawing, with pale cheeks and humid eyes. She remembered distinctly her mother\u0027s gratified look and manner, as she passed from Lady Ennismore to her dull son, with the proud feeling that Julia would soon link her name with that of a baron of the united kingdom. Young as Christobelle then was, she could observe the [122] difference between Julia\u0027s happy, beaming eyes, and the melancholy expression of her eldest sister\u0027s countenance, pale as her own white dress, till an allusion to Hatton, or the name of Pynsent, suffused her cheek with a passing blush. She saw and observed much, which became a subject of meditation in after life. Lady Ennismore demanded an audience of Sir John Wetheral, previous to Lady Spottiswoode\u0027s ball, and the interview took place in his study, with every appropriate ceremony and mystery. Lady Ennismore then, in behalf of her son, offered to arrange the settlements, and enter upon the little momentous prelude which usually preceded matrimonial vows. Sir John expressed his surprise that his lordship should require an interpreter and agent in a matter concerning his own affairs. Lady Ennismore was never wanting to herself. \"My dear Sir John, young people are shy of entering into affairs which involve much consideration. Perhaps I have laid the foundation of indolence in my son\u0027s mind by acting according to his wishes, instead of compelling him to become his own homme d\u0027affaires; but my son\u0027s health must prove his excuse, and I shall be truly [123] happy to resign the reins into Julia\u0027s hand in a very few weeks.\" \"Your ladyship must have enervated his capacity for business, since my lord is unequal to make a settlement upon his wife,\" observed Sir John, drily. Lady Ennismore appeared absorbed in calculation, as she ran up quickly a sum pencilled upon a slip of paper, which she held in her hand. The employment prevented her from comprehending the purport of the speech, or it allowed her ladyship a plea for momentary absence of mind. She turned suddenly from her calculation. \"My dear sir, Ennismore\u0027s income allows him to settle three thousand a year upon his lady.\" Sir John bowed. \"Her jointure will be three thousand pounds,\" continued Lady Ennismore, \"and five hundred pounds yearly pin-money: does that allowance appear too little, my dear Sir John?\" \"It may not be too large an allowance for Lady Ennismore,\" he replied; \"but it is a large sum for Julia Wetheral. I trust my daughter [124] will manage her affairs with prudence and credit to herself.\" \"I do not doubt her excellence in any point,\" said her ladyship, in winning tones. \"Julia will be the pride of the family who are fortunate enough to receive her.\" A father\u0027s tender feelings were touched; they were easily roused on the subject of his wife and children. He bowed to Lady Ennismore with more conciliation of manner than he had yet displayed towards her ladyship. \"I believe my daughter\u0027s heart to be excellent, and I am sure she will act uprightly in every situation.\" \"Ennismore and myself justly value our treasure, Sir John, and I shall retire from Bedinfield with the happy certainty of leaving my son in the possession of every earthly comfort. Young people should live to themselves, and I hold it good policy, on every account, to retire. Do you not think with me, Sir John?\" \"I agree with your ladyship. I should not wish to be domesticated with young people upon their marriage. They are entering upon life as we have done before them; and the experience of old people is offensive to the unsuspicious. [125] They must win, through suffering, the knowledge we have acquired: we did so, Lady Ennismore.\" \"I flatter myself, Sir John, we think alike on many subjects. I shall retire to tranquillity and repose in my cottage of gentility, and the young people will make the walls of Bedinfield ring with festivity. I trust we may claim your daughter in a very short time. The settlements will not be long in my agent\u0027s hands, and Ennismore is so anxious to present his lady in Staffordshire! May I make interest to salute my real daughter in a month? I am now equally anxious to make my own arrangements; and my first wish must be to secure my son\u0027s comfort, before I allow myself to consider my own gratifications.\" Sir John admitted that suspense was useless when both parties understood the nature of their engagements; and the marriage was fixed to take place as soon as the settlements should be ready for signature. There was great ceremony in presenting jewels; and Lady Wetheral was the head and front of every thing. There was immense preparation in the wardrobe department, far exceeding, in extent and expense, the ample and handsome dresses prepared for Mrs. [126] Boscawen. Her ladyship explained the necessity of a very distinct line of demarkation in the wardrobe of the sisters. \"Julia marries a peer, consequently she will require a certain style of magnificence in her appearance. Isabel married a man of considerable wealth, but still the young wife of an elderly commoner is not of material importance in society. Isabel must nurse Boscawen, who is scarcely ever free from ague since he visited Holland, and these splendid silks would be useless, fading at Brierly; it would have been worse than folly to have given a peeress\u0027s trousseau to poor Isabel, but they will both attend your marriage, my dear Julia. It will be a proud day to us all, when you become the wife of Ennismore, a young nobleman possessing peculiar steadiness of character; and, though slightly delicate, his mind is elastic, and his love strongly developed towards you. Independently of his rank and title, I should prefer Ennismore to the young men of the present day. The necklace he presented to you so gallantly are diamonds of the first water.\" \"Lady Ennismore presented them to Julia, mamma,\" observed Clara, with simplicity. \"Fiddle faddle! they were presented in excellent taste. Isabel has no jewels, poor girl.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1964/56299.html","bookId":734,"book":{"id":734,"title":"The Manoeuvring Mother Vol. I.","description":"简介： Sir John and Lady Wetheral were blessed with four fine little girls, who promised to be all the fond heart of a parent could wish; for, as her ladyship observed with pride, their forms were perfect, and their features were faultless.
