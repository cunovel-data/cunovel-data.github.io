The silence of the vision over St. Peter\u0027s Square sang louder than any chorus of angels.\\n\\n As he stared up at Camerlegno Ventresca, Mortati felt the paralyzing collision of his heart and mind. The vision seemed real, tangible. And yet... how could it be? Everyone had seen the camerlegno get in the helicopter. They had all witnessed the ball of light in the sky. And now, somehow, the camerlegno stood high above them on the rooftop terrace. Transported by angels? Reincarnated by the hand of God?\\n\\n This is impossible...\\n\\n Mortati\u0027s heart wanted nothing more than to believe, but his mind cried out for reason. And yet all around him, the cardinals stared up, obviously seeing what he was seeing, paralyzed with wonder.\\n\\n It was the camerlegno. There was no doubt. But he looked different somehow. Divine. As if he had been purified. A spirit? A man? His white flesh shone in the spotlights with an incorporeal weightlessness.\\n\\n In the square there was crying, cheering, spontaneous applause. A group of nuns fell to their knees and wailed saetas. A pulsing grew from in the crowd. Suddenly, the entire square was chanting the camerlegno\u0027s name. The cardinals, some with tears rolling down their faces, joined in. Mortati looked around him and tried to comprehend. Is this really happening?\\n\\n Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca stood on the rooftop terrace of St. Peter\u0027s Basilica and looked down over the multitudes of people staring up at him. Was he awake or dreaming? He felt transformed, otherworldly. He wondered if it was his body or just his spirit that had floated down from heaven toward the soft, darkened expanse of the Vatican City Gardens... alighting like a silent angel on the deserted lawns, his black parachute shrouded from the madness by the towering shadow of St. Peter\u0027s Basilica. He wondered if it was his body or his spirit that had possessed the strength to climb the ancient Stairway of Medallions to the rooftop terrace where he now stood.\\n\\n He felt as light as a ghost.\\n\\n Although the people below were chanting his name, he knew it was not him they were cheering. They were cheering from impulsive joy, the same kind of joy he felt every day of his life as he pondered the Almighty. They were experiencing what each of them had always longed for... an assurance of the beyond... a substantiation of the power of the Creator.\\n\\n Camerlegno Ventresca had prayed all his life for this moment, and still, even he could not fathom that God had found a way to make it manifest. He wanted to cry out to them. Your God is a living God! Behold the miracles all around you!\\n\\n He stood there a while, numb and yet feeling more than he had ever felt. When, at last, the spirit moved him, he bowed his head and stepped back from the edge.\\n\\n Alone now, he knelt on the roof, and prayed.\\n\\n 127\\n\\n The images around him blurred, drifting in and out. Langdon\u0027s eyes slowly began to focus. His legs ached, and his body felt like it had been run over by a truck. He was lying on his side on the ground. Something stunk, like bile. He could still hear the incessant sound of lapping water. It no longer sounded peaceful to him. There were other sounds too - talking close around him. He saw blurry white forms. Were they all wearing white? Langdon decided he was either in an asylum or heaven. From the burning in his throat, Langdon decided it could not be heaven.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s finished vomiting,\" one man said in Italian. \"Turn him.\" The voice was firm and professional.\\n\\n Langdon felt hands slowly rolling him onto his back. His head swam. He tried to sit up, but the hands gently forced him back down. His body submitted. Then Langdon felt someone going through his pockets, removing items.\\n\\n Then he passed out cold.\\n\\n Dr. Jacobus was not a religious man; the science of medicine had bred that from him long ago. And yet, the events in Vatican City tonight had put his systematic logic to the test. Now bodies are falling from the sky?\\n\\n Dr. Jacobus felt the pulse of the bedraggled man they had just pulled from the Tiber River. The doctor decided that God himself had hand-delivered this one to safety. The concussion of hitting the water had knocked the victim unconscious, and if it had not been for Jacobus and his crew standing out on the shore watching the spectacle in the sky, this falling soul would surely have gone unnoticed and drowned.\\n\\n \"e Americano,\" a nurse said, going through the man\u0027s wallet after they pulled him to dry land.\\n\\n American? Romans often joked that Americans had gotten so abundant in Rome that hamburgers should become the official Italian food. But Americans falling from the sky? Jacobus flicked a penlight in the man\u0027s eyes, testing his dilation. \"Sir? Can you hear me? Do you know where you are?\"\\n\\n The man was unconscious again. Jacobus was not surprised. The man had vomited a lot of water after Jacobus had performed CPR.\\n\\n \"Si chiama Robert Langdon,\" the nurse said, reading the man\u0027s driver\u0027s license.\\n\\n The group assembled on the dock all stopped short.\\n\\n \"Impossibile!\" Jacobus declared. Robert Langdon was the man from the television - the American professor who had been helping the Vatican. Jacobus had seen Mr. Langdon, only minutes ago, getting into a helicopter in St. Peter\u0027s Square and flying miles up into the air. Jacobus and the others had run out to the dock to witness the antimatter explosion - a tremendous sphere of light like nothing any of them had ever seen. How could this be the same man!\\n\\n \"It\u0027s him!\" the nurse exclaimed, brushing his soaked hair back. \"And I recognize his tweed coat!\"\\n\\n Suddenly someone was yelling from the hospital entryway. It was one of the patients. She was screaming, going mad, holding her portable radio to the sky and praising God. Apparently Camerlegno Ventresca had just miraculously appeared on the roof of the Vatican.\\n\\n Dr. Jacobus decided, when his shift got off at 8 A.M., he was going straight to church.\\n\\n The lights over Langdon\u0027s head were brighter now, sterile. He was on some kind of examination table. He smelled astringents, strange chemicals. Someone had just given him an injection, and they had removed his clothes.\\n\\n Definitely not gypsies, he decided in his semiconscious delirium. Aliens, perhaps? Yes, he had heard about things like this. Fortunately these beings would not harm him. All they wanted were his -\\n\\n \"Not on your life!\" Langdon sat bolt upright, eyes flying open.\\n\\n \"Attento!\" one of the creatures yelled, steadying him. His badge read Dr. Jacobus. He looked remarkably human.\\n\\n Langdon stammered, \"I... thought...\"\\n\\n \"Easy, Mr. Langdon. You\u0027re in a hospital.\"\\n\\n The fog began to lift. Langdon felt a wave of relief. He hated hospitals, but they certainly beat aliens harvesting his testicles.\\n\\n \"My name is Dr. Jacobus,\" the man said. He explained what had just happened. \"You are very lucky to be alive.\"\\n\\n Langdon did not feel lucky. He could barely make sense of his own memories... the helicopter... the camerlegno. His body ached everywhere. They gave him some water, and he rinsed out his mouth. They placed a new gauze on his palm.\\n\\n \"Where are my clothes?\" Langdon asked. He was wearing a paper robe.\\n\\n One of the nurses motioned to a dripping wad of shredded khaki and tweed on the counter. \"They were soaked. We had to cut them off you.\"\\n\\n Langdon looked at his shredded Harris tweed and frowned.\\n\\n \"You had some Kleenex in your pocket,\" the nurse said.\\n\\n It was then that Langdon saw the ravaged shreds of parchment clinging all over the lining of his jacket. The folio from Galileo\u0027s Diagramma. The last copy on earth had just dissolved. He was too numb to know how to react. He just stared.\\n\\n \"We saved your personal items.\" She held up a plastic bin. \"Wallet, camcorder, and pen. I dried the camcorder off the best I could.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t own a camcorder.\"\\n\\n The nurse frowned and held out the bin. Langdon looked at the contents. Along with his wallet and pen was a tiny Sony RUVI camcorder. He recalled it now. Kohler had handed it to him and asked him to give it to the media.\\n\\n \"We found it in your pocket. I think you\u0027ll need a new one, though.\" The nurse flipped open the two-inch screen on the back. \"Your viewer is cracked.\" Then she brightened. \"The sound still works, though. Barely.\" She held the device up to her ear. \"Keeps playing something over and over.\" She listened a moment and then scowled, handing it to Langdon. \"Two guys arguing, I think.\"\\n\\n Puzzled, Langdon took the camcorder and held it to his ear. The voices were pinched and metallic, but they were discernible. One close. One far away. Langdon recognized them both.\\n\\n Sitting there in his paper gown, Langdon listened in amazement to the conversation. Although he couldn\u0027t see what was happening, when he heard the shocking finale, he was thankful he had been spared the visual.\\n\\n My God!\\n\\n As the conversation began playing again from the beginning, Langdon lowered the camcorder from his ear and sat in appalled mystification. The antimatter... the helicopter... Langdon\u0027s mind now kicked into gear.\\n\\n But that means...\\n\\n He wanted to vomit again. With a rising fury of disorientation and rage, Langdon got off the table and stood on shaky legs.\\n\\n \"Mr. Langdon!\" the doctor said, trying to stop him.\\n\\n \"I need some clothes,\" Langdon demanded, feeling the draft on his rear from the backless gown.\\n\\n \"But, you need to rest.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m checking out. Now. I need some clothes.\"\\n\\n \"But, sir, you - \"\\n\\n \"Now!\"\\n\\n Everyone exchanged bewildered looks. \"We have no clothes,\" the doctor said. \"Perhaps tomorrow a friend could bring you some.\"\\n\\n Langdon drew a slow patient breath and locked eyes with the doctor. \"Dr. Jacobus, I am walking out your door right now. I need clothes. I am going to Vatican City. One does not go to Vatican City with one\u0027s ass hanging out. Do I make myself clear?\"\\n\\n Dr. Jacobus swallowed hard. \"Get this man something to wear.\"\\n\\n When Langdon limped out of Hospital Tiberina, he felt like an overgrown Cub Scout. He was wearing a blue paramedic\u0027s jumpsuit that zipped up the front and was adorned with cloth badges that apparently depicted his numerous qualifications.\\n\\n The woman accompanying him was heavyset and wore a similar suit. The doctor had assured Langdon she would get him to the Vatican in record time.\\n\\n \"Molto traffico,\" Langdon said, reminding her that the area around the Vatican was packed with cars and people.\\n\\n The woman looked unconcerned. She pointed proudly to one of her patches. \"Sono conducente di ambulanza.\"\\n\\n \"Ambulanza?\" That explained it. Langdon felt like he could use an ambulance ride.\\n\\n The woman led him around the side of the building. On an outcropping over the water was a cement deck where her vehicle sat waiting. When Langdon saw the vehicle he stopped in his tracks. It was an aging medevac chopper. The hull read Aero-Ambulanza.\\n\\n He hung his head.\\n\\n The woman smiled. \"Fly Vatican City. Very fast.\"\\n\\n 128\\n\\n The College of Cardinals bristled with ebullience and electricity as they streamed back into the Sistine Chapel. In contrast, Mortati felt in himself a rising confusion he thought might lift him off the floor and carry him away. He believed in the ancient miracles of the Scriptures, and yet what he had just witnessed in person was something he could not possibly comprehend. After a lifetime of devotion, seventy-nine years, Mortati knew these events should ignite in him a pious exuberance... a fervent and living faith. And yet all he felt was a growing spectral unease. Something did not feel right.\\n\\n \"Signore Mortati!\" a Swiss Guard yelled, running down the hall. \"We have gone to the roof as you asked. The camerlegno is... flesh! He is a true man! He is not a spirit! He is exactly as we knew him!\"\\n\\n \"Did he speak to you?\"\\n\\n \"He kneels in silent prayer! We are afraid to touch him!\"\\n\\n Mortati was at a loss. \"Tell him... his cardinals await.\"\\n\\n \"Signore, because he is a man...\" the guard hesitated.\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"His chest... he is burned. Should we bind his wounds? He must be in pain.\"\\n\\n Mortati considered it. Nothing in his lifetime of service to the church had prepared him for this situation. \"He is a man, so serve him as a man. Bathe him. Bind his wounds. Dress him in fresh robes. We await his arrival in the Sistine Chapel.\"\\n\\n The guard ran off.\\n\\n Mortati headed for the chapel. The rest of the cardinals were inside now. As he walked down the hall, he saw Vittoria Vetra slumped alone on a bench at the foot of the Royal Staircase. He could see the pain and loneliness of her loss and wanted to go to her, but he knew it would have to wait. He had work to do... although he had no idea what that work could possibly be.\\n\\n Mortati entered the chapel. There was a riotous excitement. He closed the door. God help me.\\n\\n Hospital Tiberina\u0027s twin-rotor Aero-Ambulanza circled in behind Vatican City, and Langdon clenched his teeth, swearing to God this was the very last helicopter ride of his life.\\n\\n After convincing the pilot that the rules governing Vatican airspace were the least of the Vatican\u0027s concerns right now, he guided her in, unseen, over the rear wall, and landed them on the Vatican\u0027s helipad.\\n\\n \"Grazie,\" he said, lowering himself painfully onto the ground. She blew him a kiss and quickly took off, disappearing back over the wall and into the night.\\n\\n Langdon exhaled, trying to clear his head, hoping to make sense of what he was about to do. With the camcorder in hand, he boarded the same golf cart he had ridden earlier that day. It had not been charged, and the battery-meter registered close to empty. Langdon drove without headlights to conserve power.\\n\\n He also preferred no one see him coming.\\n\\n At the back of the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati stood in a daze as he watched the pandemonium before him.\\n\\n \"It was a miracle!\" one of the cardinals shouted. \"The work of God!\"\\n\\n \"Yes!\" others exclaimed. \"God has made His will manifest!\"\\n\\n \"The camerlegno will be our Pope!\" another shouted. \"He is not a cardinal, but God has sent a miraculous sign!\"\\n\\n \"Yes!\" someone agreed. \"The laws of conclave are man\u0027s laws. God\u0027s will is before us! I call for a balloting immediately!\"\\n\\n \"A balloting?\" Mortati demanded, moving toward them. \"I believe that is my job.\"\\n\\n Everyone turned.\\n\\n Mortati could sense the cardinals studying him. They seemed distant, at a loss, offended by his sobriety. Mortati longed to feel his heart swept up in the miraculous exultation he saw in the faces around him. But he was not. He felt an inexplicable pain in his soul... an aching sadness he could not explain. He had vowed to guide these proceedings with purity of soul, and this hesitancy was something he could not deny.\\n\\n \"My friends,\" Mortati said, stepping to the altar. His voice did not seem his own. \"I suspect I will struggle for the rest of my days with the meaning of what I have witnessed tonight. And yet, what you are suggesting regarding the camerlegno... it cannot possibly be God\u0027s will.\"\\n\\n The room fell silent.\\n\\n \"How... can you say that?\" one of the cardinals finally demanded. \"The camerlegno saved the church. God spoke to the camerlegno directly! The man survived death itself! What sign do we need!\"\\n\\n \"The camerlegno is coming to us now,\" Mortati said. \"Let us wait. Let us hear him before we have a balloting. There may be an explanation.\"\\n\\n \"An explanation?\"\\n\\n \"As your Great Elector, I have vowed to uphold the laws of conclave. You are no doubt aware that by Holy Law the camerlegno is ineligible for election to the papacy. He is not a cardinal. He is a priest... a chamberlain. There is also the question of his inadequate age.\" Mortati felt the stares hardening. \"By even allowing a balloting, I would be requesting that you endorse a man who Vatican Law proclaims ineligible. I would be asking each of you to break a sacred oath.\"\\n\\n \"But what happened here tonight,\" someone stammered, \"it certainly transcends our laws!\"\\n\\n \"Does it?\" Mortati boomed, not even knowing now where his words were coming from. \"Is it God\u0027s will that we discard the rules of the church? Is it God\u0027s will that we abandon reason and give ourselves over to frenzy?\"\\n\\n \"But did you not see what we saw?\" another challenged angrily. \"How can you presume to question that kind of power!\"\\n\\n Mortati\u0027s voice bellowed now with a resonance he had never known. \"I am not questioning God\u0027s power! It is God who gave us reason and circumspection! It is God we serve by exercising prudence!\"\\n\\n 129\\n\\n In the hallway outside the Sistine Chapel, Vittoria Vetra sat benumbed on a bench at the foot of the Royal Staircase. When she saw the figure coming through the rear door, she wondered if she were seeing another spirit. He was bandaged, limping, and wearing some kind of medical suit.\\n\\n She stood... unable to believe the vision. \"Ro... bert?\"\\n\\n He never answered. He strode directly to her and wrapped her in his arms. When he pressed his lips to hers, it was an impulsive, longing kiss filled with thankfulness.\\n\\n Vittoria felt the tears coming. \"Oh, God... oh, thank God...\"\\n\\n He kissed her again, more passionately, and she pressed against him, losing herself in his embrace. Their bodies locked, as if they had known each other for years. She forgot the fear and pain. She closed her eyes, weightless in the moment.\\n\\n \"It is God\u0027s will!\" someone was yelling, his voice echoing in the Sistine Chapel. \"Who but the chosen one could have survived that diabolical explosion?\"\\n\\n \"Me,\" a voice reverberated from the back of the chapel.\\n\\n Mortati and the others turned in wonder at the bedraggled form coming up the center aisle. \"Mr.... Langdon?\"\\n\\n Without a word, Langdon walked slowly to the front of the chapel. Vittoria Vetra entered too. Then two guards hurried in, pushing a cart with a large television on it. Langdon waited while they plugged it in, facing the cardinals. Then Langdon motioned for the guards to leave. They did, closing the door behind them.\\n\\n Now it was only Langdon, Vittoria, and the cardinals. Langdon plugged the Sony RUVI\u0027s output into the television. Then he pressed Play.\\n\\n The television blared to life.\\n\\n The scene that materialized before the cardinals revealed the Pope\u0027s office. The video had been awkwardly filmed, as if by hidden camera. Off center on the screen the camerlegno stood in the dimness, in front of a fire. Although he appeared to be talking directly to the camera, it quickly became evident that he was speaking to someone else - whoever was making this video. Langdon told them the video was filmed by Maximilian Kohler, the director of CERN. Only an hour ago Kohler had secretly recorded his meeting with the camerlegno by using a tiny camcorder covertly mounted under the arm of his wheelchair.\\n\\n Mortati and the cardinals watched in bewilderment. Although the conversation was already in progress, Langdon did not bother to rewind. Apparently, whatever Langdon wanted the cardinals to see was coming up...\\n\\n \"Leonardo Vetra kept diaries?\" the camerlegno was saying. \"I suppose that is good news for CERN. If the diaries contain his processes for creating antimatter - \"\\n\\n \"They don\u0027t,\" Kohler said. \"You will be relieved to know those processes died with Leonardo. However, his diaries spoke of something else. You.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno looked troubled. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"They described a meeting Leonardo had last month. With you.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno hesitated, then looked toward the door. \"Rocher should not have granted you access without consulting me. How did you get in here?\"\\n\\n \"Rocher knows the truth. I called earlier and told him what you have done.\"\\n\\n \"What I have done? Whatever story you told him, Rocher is a Swiss Guard and far too faithful to this church to believe a bitter scientist over his camerlegno.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, he is too faithful not to believe. He is so faithful that despite the evidence that one of his loyal guards had betrayed the church, he refused to accept it. All day long he has been searching for another explanation.\"\\n\\n \"So you gave him one.\"\\n\\n \"The truth. Shocking as it was.\"\\n\\n \"If Rocher believed you, he would have arrested me.\"\\n\\n \"No. I wouldn\u0027t let him. I offered him my silence in exchange for this meeting.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno let out an odd laugh. \"You plan to blackmail the church with a story that no one will possibly believe?\"\\n\\n \"I have no need of blackmail. I simply want to hear the truth from your lips. Leonardo Vetra was a friend.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno said nothing. He simply stared down at Kohler.\\n\\n \"Try this,\" Kohler snapped. \"About a month ago, Leonardo Vetra contacted you requesting an urgent audience with the Pope - an audience you granted because the Pope was an admirer of Leonardo\u0027s work and because Leonardo said it was an emergency.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno turned to the fire. He said nothing.\\n\\n \"Leonardo came to the Vatican in great secrecy. He was betraying his daughter\u0027s confidence by coming here, a fact that troubled him deeply, but he felt he had no choice. His research had left him deeply conflicted and in need of spiritual guidance from the church. In a private meeting, he told you and the Pope that he had made a scientific discovery with profound religious implications. He had proved Genesis was physically possible, and that intense sources of energy - what Vetra called God - could duplicate the moment of Creation.\"\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n \"The Pope was stunned,\" Kohler continued. \"He wanted Leonardo to go public. His Holiness thought this discovery might begin to bridge the gap between science and religion - one of the Pope\u0027s life dreams. Then Leonardo explained to you the downside - the reason he required the church\u0027s guidance. It seemed his Creation experiment, exactly as your Bible predicts, produced everything in pairs. Opposites. Light and dark. Vetra found himself, in addition to creating matter, creating antimatter. Shall I go on?\"\\n\\n The camerlegno was silent. He bent down and stoked the coals.\\n\\n \"After Leonardo Vetra came here,\" Kohler said, \"you came to CERN to see his work. Leonardo\u0027s diaries said you made a personal trip to his lab.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno looked up.\\n\\n Kohler went on. \"The Pope could not travel without attracting media attention, so he sent you. Leonardo gave you a secret tour of his lab. He showed you an antimatter annihilation - the Big Bang - the power of Creation. He also showed you a large specimen he kept locked away as proof that his new process could produce antimatter on a large scale. You were in awe. You returned to Vatican City to report to the Pope what you had witnessed.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno sighed. \"And what is it that troubles you? That I would respect Leonardo\u0027s confidentiality by pretending before the world tonight that I knew nothing of antimatter?\"\\n\\n \"No! It troubles me that Leonardo Vetra practically proved the existence of your God, and you had him murdered!\"\\n\\n The camerlegno turned now, his face revealing nothing.\\n\\n The only sound was the crackle of the fire.\\n\\n Suddenly, the camera jiggled, and Kohler\u0027s arm appeared in the frame. He leaned forward, seeming to struggle with something affixed beneath his wheelchair. When he sat back down, he held a pistol out before him. The camera angle was a chilling one... looking from behind... down the length of the outstretched gun... directly at the camerlegno.\\n\\n Kohler said, \"Confess your sins, Father. Now.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno looked startled. \"You will never get out of here alive.\"\\n\\n \"Death would be a welcome relief from the misery your faith has put me through since I was a boy.\" Kohler held the gun with both hands now. \"I am giving you a choice. Confess your sins... or die right now.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno glanced toward the door.\\n\\n \"Rocher is outside,\" Kohler challenged. \"He too is prepared to kill you.\"\\n\\n \"Rocher is a sworn protector of th - \"\\n\\n \"Rocher let me in here. Armed. He is sickened by your lies. You have a single option. Confess to me. I have to hear it from your very lips.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno hesitated.\\n\\n Kohler cocked his gun. \"Do you really doubt I will kill you?\"\\n\\n \"No matter what I tell you,\" the camerlegno said, \"a man like you will never understand.\"\\n\\n \"Try me.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno stood still for a moment, a dominant silhouette in the dim light of the fire. When he spoke, his words echoed with a dignity more suited to the glorious recounting of altruism than that of a confession.\\n\\n \"Since the beginning of time,\" the camerlegno said, \"this church has fought the enemies of God. Sometimes with words. Sometimes with swords. And we have always survived.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno radiated conviction.\\n\\n \"But the demons of the past,\" he continued, \"were demons of fire and abomination... they were enemies we could fight - enemies who inspired fear. Yet Satan is shrewd. As time passed, he cast off his diabolical countenance for a new face... the face of pure reason. Transparent and insidious, but soulless all the same.\" The camerlegno\u0027s voice flashed sudden anger - an almost maniacal transition. \"Tell me, Mr. Kohler! How can the church condemn that which makes logical sense to our minds! How can we decry that which is now the very foundation of our society! Each time the church raises its voice in warning, you shout back, calling us ignorant. Paranoid. Controlling! And so your evil grows. Shrouded in a veil of self-righteous intellectualism. It spreads like a cancer. Sanctified by the miracles of its own technology. Deifying itself! Until we no longer suspect you are anything but pure goodness. Science has come to save us from our sickness, hunger, and pain! Behold science - the new God of endless miracles, omnipotent and benevolent! Ignore the weapons and the chaos. Forget the fractured loneliness and endless peril. Science is here!\" The camerlegno stepped toward the gun. \"But I have seen Satan\u0027s face lurking... I have seen the peril...\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about! Vetra\u0027s science practically proved the existence of your God! He was your ally!\"\\n\\n \"Ally? Science and religion are not in this together! We do not seek the same God, you and I! Who is your God? One of protons, masses, and particle charges? How does your God inspire? How does your God reach into the hearts of man and remind him he is accountable to a greater power! Remind him that he is accountable to his fellow man! Vetra was misguided. His work was not religious, it was sacrilegious! Man cannot put God\u0027s Creation in a test tube and wave it around for the world to see! This does not glorify God, it demeans God!\" The camerlegno was clawing at his body now, his voice manic.\\n\\n \"And so you had Leonardo Vetra killed!\"\\n\\n \"For the church! For all mankind! The madness of it! Man is not ready to hold the power of Creation in his hands. God in a test tube? A droplet of liquid that can vaporize an entire city? He had to be stopped!\" The camerlegno fell abruptly silent. He looked away, back toward the fire. He seemed to be contemplating his options.\\n\\n Kohler\u0027s hands leveled the gun. \"You have confessed. You have no escape.\"\\n\\n The camerlegno laughed sadly. \"Don\u0027t you see. Confessing your sins is the escape.\" He looked toward the door. \"When God is on your side, you have options a man like you could never comprehend.\" With his words still hanging in the air, the camerlegno grabbed the neck of his cassock and violently tore it open, revealing his bare chest.\\n\\n Kohler jolted, obviously startled. \"What are you doing!\"\\n\\n The camerlegno did not reply. He stepped backward, toward the fireplace, and removed an object from the glowing embers.\\n\\n \"Stop!\" Kohler demanded, his gun still leveled. \"What are you doing!\"\\n\\n When the camerlegno turned, he was holding a red-hot brand. The Illuminati Diamond. The man\u0027s eyes looked wild suddenly. \"I had intended to do this all alone.\" His voice seethed with a feral intensity. \"But now... I see God meant for you to be here. You are my salvation.\"\\n\\n Before Kohler could react, the camerlegno closed his eyes, arched his back, and rammed the red hot brand into the center of his own chest. His flesh hissed. \"Mother Mary! Blessed Mother... Behold your son!\" He screamed out in agony.\\n\\n Kohler lurched into the frame now... standing awkwardly on his feet, gun wavering wildly before him.\\n\\n The camerlegno screamed louder, teetering in shock. He threw the brand at Kohler\u0027s feet. Then the priest collapsed on the floor, writhing in agony.\\n\\n What happened next was a blur.\\n\\n There was a great flurry onscreen as the Swiss Guard burst into the room. The soundtrack exploded with gunfire. Kohler clutched his chest, blown backward, bleeding, falling into his wheelchair.\\n\\n \"No!\" Rocher called, trying to stop his guards from firing on Kohler.\\n\\n The camerlegno, still writhing on the floor, rolled and pointed frantically at Rocher. \"Illuminatus!\"\\n\\n \"You bastard,\" Rocher yelled, running at him. \"You sanctimonious bas - \"\\n\\n Chartrand cut him down with three bullets. Rocher slid dead across the floor.\\n\\n Then the guards ran to the wounded camerlegno, gathering around him. As they huddled, the video caught the face of a dazed Robert Langdon, kneeling beside the wheelchair, looking at the brand. Then, the entire frame began lurching wildly. Kohler had regained consciousness and was detaching the tiny camcorder from its holder under the arm of the wheelchair. Then he tried to hand the camcorder to Langdon.\\n\\n \"G-give...\" Kohler gasped. \"G-give this to the m-media.\"\\n\\n Then the screen went blank. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/angels-demons-robert-langdon-1/page-36.html","bookId":2228,"book":{"id":2228,"title":"Angels Demons (Robert Langdon #1)","description":"Storyline: World-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist. What he discovers is unimaginable: a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church by a centuriesold underground organization - the Illuminati.
