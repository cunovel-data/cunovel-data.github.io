The fresh air felt like a drug as it flowed into Langdon\u0027s lungs. The purple spots in his vision quickly faded. The guilt, however, did not. He had just been accomplice to stealing a priceless relic from the world\u0027s most private vault. The camerlegno had said, I am giving you my trust.\n \"Hurry,\" Vittoria said, still holding the folio in her hand and striding at a half-jog across Via Borgia in the direction of Olivetti\u0027s office.\n \"If any water gets on that papyrus - \"\n \"Calm down. When we decipher this thing, we can return their sacred Folio 5.\"\n Langdon accelerated to keep up. Beyond feeling like a criminal, he was still dazed over the document\u0027s spellbinding implications. John Milton was an Illuminatus. He composed the poem for Galileo to publish in Folio 5... far from the eyes of the Vatican.\n As they left the courtyard, Vittoria held out the folio for Langdon. \"You think you can decipher this thing? Or did we just kill all those brain cells for kicks?\"\n Langdon took the document carefully in his hands. Without hesitation he slipped it into one of the breast pockets of his tweed jacket, out of the sunlight and dangers of moisture. \"I deciphered it already.\"\n Vittoria stopped short. \"You what?\"\n Langdon kept moving.\n Vittoria hustled to catch up. \"You read it once! I thought it was supposed to be hard!\"\n Langdon knew she was right, and yet he had deciphered the segno in a single reading. A perfect stanza of iambic pentameter, and the first altar of science had revealed itself in pristine clarity. Admittedly, the ease with which he had accomplished the task left him with a nagging disquietude. He was a child of the Puritan work ethic. He could still hear his father speaking the old New England aphorism: If it wasn\u0027t painfully difficult, you did it wrong. Langdon hoped the saying was false. \"I deciphered it,\" he said, moving faster now. \"I know where the first killing is going to happen. We need to warn Olivetti.\"\n Vittoria closed in on him. \"How could you already know? Let me see that thing again.\" With the sleight of a boxer, she slipped a lissome hand into his pocket and pulled out the folio again.\n \"Careful!\" Langdon said. \"You can\u0027t - \"\n Vittoria ignored him. Folio in hand, she floated beside him, holding the document up to the evening light, examining the margins. As she began reading aloud, Langdon moved to retrieve the folio but instead found himself bewitched by Vittoria\u0027s accented alto speaking the syllables in perfect rhythm with her gait.\n For a moment, hearing the verse aloud, Langdon felt transported in time... as though he were one of Galileo\u0027s contemporaries, listening to the poem for the first time... knowing it was a test, a map, a clue unveiling the four altars of science... the four markers that blazed a secret path across Rome. The verse flowed from Vittoria\u0027s lips like a song.\n From Santi\u0027s earthly tomb with demon\u0027s hole,\n \u0027Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold.\n The path of light is laid, the sacred test,\n Let angels guide you on your lofty quest.\n Vittoria read it twice and then fell silent, as if letting the ancient words resonate on their own.\n From Santi\u0027s earthly tomb, Langdon repeated in his mind. The poem was crystal clear about that. The Path of Illumination began at Santi\u0027s tomb. From there, across Rome, the markers blazed the trail.\n From Santi\u0027s earthly tomb with demon\u0027s hole,\n \u0027Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold.\n Mystic elements. Also clear. Earth, Air, Fire, Water. Elements of science, the four Illuminati markers disguised as religious sculpture.\n \"The first marker,\" Vittoria said, \"sounds like it\u0027s at Santi\u0027s tomb.\"\n Langdon smiled. \"I told you it wasn\u0027t that tough.\"\n \"So who is Santi?\" she asked, sounding suddenly excited. \"And where\u0027s his tomb?\"\n Langdon chuckled to himself. He was amazed how few people knew Santi, the last name of one of the most famous Renaissance artists ever to live. His first name was world renowned... the child prodigy who at the age of twenty-five was already doing commissions for Pope Julius II, and when he died at only thirty-eight, left behind the greatest collection of frescoes the world had ever seen. Santi was a behemoth in the art world, and being known solely by one\u0027s first name was a level of fame achieved only by an elite few... people like Napoleon, Galileo, and Jesus... and, of course, the demigods Langdon now heard blaring from Harvard dormitories - Sting, Madonna, Jewel, and the artist formerly known as Prince, who had changed his name to the symbol\n Angels \u0026 Demons\n causing Langdon to dub him \"The Tau Cross With Intersecting Hermaphroditic Ankh.\"\n \"Santi,\" Langdon said, \"is the last name of the great Renaissance master, Raphael.\"\n Vittoria looked surprised. \"Raphael? As in the Raphael?\"\n \"The one and only.\" Langdon pushed on toward the Office of the Swiss Guard.\n \"So the path starts at Raphael\u0027s tomb?\"\n \"It actually makes perfect sense,\" Langdon said as they rushed on. \"The Illuminati often considered great artists and sculptors honorary brothers in enlightenment. The Illuminati could have chosen Raphael\u0027s tomb as a kind of tribute.\" Langdon also knew that Raphael, like many other religious artists, was a suspected closet atheist.\n Vittoria slipped the folio carefully back in Langdon\u0027s pocket. \"So where is he buried?\"\n Langdon took a deep breath. \"Believe it or not, Raphael\u0027s buried in the Pantheon.\"\n Vittoria looked skeptical. \"The Pantheon?\"\n \"The Raphael at the Pantheon.\" Langdon had to admit, the Pantheon was not what he had expected for the placement of the first marker. He would have guessed the first altar of science to be at some quiet, out of the way church, something subtle. Even in the 1600s, the Pantheon, with its tremendous, holed dome, was one of the best known sites in Rome.\n \"Is the Pantheon even a church?\" Vittoria asked.\n \"Oldest Catholic church in Rome.\"\n Vittoria shook her head. \"But do you really think the first cardinal could be killed at the Pantheon? That\u0027s got to be one of the busiest tourist spots in Rome.\"\n Langdon shrugged. \"The Illuminati said they wanted the whole world watching. Killing a cardinal at the Pantheon would certainly open some eyes.\"\n \"But how does this guy expect to kill someone at the Pantheon and get away unnoticed? It would be impossible.\"\n \"As impossible as kidnapping four cardinals from Vatican City? The poem is precise.\"\n \"And you\u0027re certain Raphael is buried inside the Pantheon?\"\n \"I\u0027ve seen his tomb many times.\"\n Vittoria nodded, still looking troubled. \"What time is it?\"\n Langdon checked. \"Seven-thirty.\"\n \"Is the Pantheon far?\"\n \"A mile maybe. We\u0027ve got time.\"\n \"The poem said Santi\u0027s earthly tomb. Does that mean anything to you?\"\n Langdon hastened diagonally across the Courtyard of the Sentinel. \"Earthly? Actually, there\u0027s probably no more earthly place in Rome than the Pantheon. It got its name from the original religion practiced there - Pantheism - the worship of all gods, specifically the pagan gods of Mother Earth.\"\n As a student of architecture, Langdon had been amazed to learn that the dimensions of the Pantheon\u0027s main chamber were a tribute to Gaea - the goddess of the Earth. The proportions were so exact that a giant spherical globe could fit perfectly inside the building with less than a millimeter to spare.\n \"Okay,\" Vittoria said, sounding more convinced. \"And demon\u0027s hole? From Santi\u0027s earthly tomb with demon\u0027s hole?\"\n Langdon was not quite as sure about this. \"Demon\u0027s hole must mean the oculus,\" he said, making a logical guess. \"The famous circular opening in the Pantheon\u0027s roof.\"\n \"But it\u0027s a church,\" Vittoria said, moving effortlessly beside him. \"Why would they call the opening a demon\u0027s hole?\"\n Langdon had actually been wondering that himself. He had never heard the term \"demon\u0027s hole,\" but he did recall a famous sixth-century critique of the Pantheon whose words seemed oddly appropriate now. The Venerable Bede had once written that the hole in the Pantheon\u0027s roof had been bored by demons trying to escape the building when it was consecrated by Boniface IV.\n \"And why,\" Vittoria added as they entered a smaller courtyard, \"why would the Illuminati use the name Santi if he was really known as Raphael?\"\n \"You ask a lot of questions.\"\n \"My dad used to say that.\"\n \"Two possible reasons. One, the word Raphael has too many syllables. It would have destroyed the poem\u0027s iambic pentameter.\"\n \"Sounds like a stretch.\"\n Langdon agreed. \"Okay, then maybe using \u0027Santi\u0027 was to make the clue more obscure, so only very enlightened men would recognize the reference to Raphael.\"\n Vittoria didn\u0027t appear to buy this either. \"I\u0027m sure Raphael\u0027s last name was very well known when he was alive.\"\n \"Surprisingly not. Single name recognition was a status symbol. Raphael shunned his last name much like pop stars do today. Take Madonna, for example. She never uses her surname, Ciccone.\"\n Vittoria looked amused. \"You know Madonna\u0027s last name?\"\n Langdon regretted the example. It was amazing the kind of garbage a mind picked up living with 10,000 adolescents.\n As he and Vittoria passed the final gate toward the Office of the Swiss Guard, their progress was halted without warning.\n \"Para!\" a voice bellowed behind them.\n Langdon and Vittoria wheeled to find themselves looking into the barrel of a rifle.\n \"Attento!\" Vittoria exclaimed, jumping back. \"Watch it with - \"\n \"Non sportarti!\" the guard snapped, cocking the weapon.\n \"Soldato!\" a voice commanded from across the courtyard. Olivetti was emerging from the security center. \"Let them go!\"\n The guard looked bewildered. \"Ma, signore, e una donna - \"\n \"Inside!\" he yelled at the guard.\n \"Signore, non posso - \"\n \"Now! You have new orders. Captain Rocher will be briefing the corps in two minutes. We will be organizing a search.\"\n Looking bewildered, the guard hurried into the security center. Olivetti marched toward Langdon, rigid and steaming. \"Our most secret archives? I\u0027ll want an explanation.\"\n \"We have good news,\" Langdon said.\n Olivetti\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"It better be damn good.\"\n 56\n The four unmarked Alpha Romeo 155 T-Sparks roared down Via dei Coronari like fighter jets off a runway. The vehicles carried twelve plainclothed Swiss Guards armed with Cherchi-Pardini semiautomatics, local-radius nerve gas canisters, and long-range stun guns. The three sharpshooters carried laser-sighted rifles.\n Sitting in the passenger seat of the lead car, Olivetti turned backward toward Langdon and Vittoria. His eyes were filled with rage. \"You assured me a sound explanation, and this is what I get?\"\n Langdon felt cramped in the small car. \"I understand your - \"\n \"No, you don\u0027t understand!\" Olivetti never raised his voice, but his intensity tripled. \"I have just removed a dozen of my best men from Vatican City on the eve of conclave. And I have done this to stake out the Pantheon based on the testimony of some American I have never met who has just interpreted a four-hundred-year-old poem. I have also just left the search for this antimatter weapon in the hands of secondary officers.\"\n Langdon resisted the urge to pull Folio 5 from his pocket and wave it in Olivetti\u0027s face. \"All I know is that the information we found refers to Raphael\u0027s tomb, and Raphael\u0027s tomb is inside the Pantheon.\"\n The officer behind the wheel nodded. \"He\u0027s right, commander. My wife and I - \"\n \"Drive,\" Olivetti snapped. He turned back to Langdon. \"How could a killer accomplish an assassination in such a crowded place and escape unseen?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Langdon said. \"But the Illuminati are obviously highly resourceful. They\u0027ve broken into both CERN and Vatican City. It\u0027s only by luck that we know where the first kill zone is. The Pantheon is your one chance to catch this guy.\"\n \"More contradictions,\" Olivetti said. \"One chance? I thought you said there was some sort of pathway. A series of markers. If the Pantheon is the right spot, we can follow the pathway to the other markers. We will have four chances to catch this guy.\"\n \"I had hoped so,\" Langdon said. \"And we would have... a century ago.\"\n Langdon\u0027s realization that the Pantheon was the first altar of science had been a bittersweet moment. History had a way of playing cruel tricks on those who chased it. It was a long shot that the Path of Illumination would be intact after all of these years, with all of its statues in place, but part of Langdon had fantasized about following the path all the way to the end and coming face to face with the sacred Illuminati lair. Alas, he realized, it was not to be. \"The Vatican had all the statues in the Pantheon removed and destroyed in the late 1800s.\"\n Vittoria looked shocked. \"Why?\"\n \"The statues were pagan Olympian Gods. Unfortunately, that means the first marker is gone... and with it - \"\n \"Any hope,\" Vittoria said, \"of finding the Path of Illumination and additional markers?\"\n Langdon shook his head. \"We have one shot. The Pantheon. After that, the path disappears.\"\n Olivetti stared at them both a long moment and then turned and faced front. \"Pull over,\" he barked to the driver.\n The driver swerved the car toward the curb and put on the brakes. Three other Alpha Romeos skidded in behind them. The Swiss Guard convoy screeched to a halt.\n \"What are you doing!\" Vittoria demanded.\n \"My job,\" Olivetti said, turning in his seat, his voice like stone. \"Mr. Langdon, when you told me you would explain the situation en route, I assumed I would be approaching the Pantheon with a clear idea of why my men are here. That is not the case. Because I am abandoning critical duties by being here, and because I have found very little that makes sense in this theory of yours about virgin sacrifices and ancient poetry, I cannot in good conscience continue. I am recalling this mission immediately.\" He pulled out his walkie-talkie and clicked it on.\n Vittoria reached across the seat and grabbed his arm. \"You can\u0027t!\"\n Olivetti slammed down the walkie-talkie and fixed her with a red-hot stare. \"Have you been to the Pantheon, Ms. Vetra?\"\n \"No, but I - \"\n \"Let me tell you something about it. The Pantheon is a single room. A circular cell made of stone and cement. It has one entrance. No windows. One narrow entrance. That entrance is flanked at all times by no less than four armed Roman policemen who protect this shrine from art defacers, anti-Christian terrorists, and gypsy tourist scams.\"\n \"Your point?\" she said coolly.\n \"My point?\" Olivetti\u0027s knuckles gripped the seat. \"My point is that what you have just told me is going to happen is utterly impossible! Can you give me one plausible scenario of how someone could kill a cardinal inside the Pantheon? How does one even get a hostage past the guards into the Pantheon in the first place? Much less actually kill him and get away?\" Olivetti leaned over the seat, his coffee breath now in Langdon\u0027s face. \"How, Mr. Langdon? One plausible scenario.\"\n Langdon felt the tiny car shrink around him. I have no idea! I\u0027m not an assassin! I don\u0027t know how he will do it! I only know -\n \"One scenario?\" Vittoria quipped, her voice unruffled. \"How about this? The killer flies over in a helicopter and drops a screaming, branded cardinal down through the hole in the roof. The cardinal hits the marble floor and dies.\"\n Everyone in the car turned and stared at Vittoria. Langdon didn\u0027t know what to think. You\u0027ve got one sick imagination, lady, but you are quick.\n Olivetti frowned. \"Possible, I admit... but hardly - \"\n \"Or the killer drugs the cardinal,\" Vittoria said, \"brings him to the Pantheon in a wheelchair like some old tourist. He wheels him inside, quietly slits his throat, and then walks out.\"\n This seemed to wake up Olivetti a bit.\n Not bad! Langdon thought.\n \"Or,\" she said, \"the killer could - \"\n \"I heard you,\" Olivetti said. \"Enough.\" He took a deep breath and blew it out. Someone rapped sharply on the window, and everyone jumped. It was a soldier from one of the other cars. Olivetti rolled down the window.\n \"Everything all right, commander?\" The soldier was dressed in street clothes. He pulled back the sleeve of his denim shirt to reveal a black chronograph military watch. \"Seven-forty, commander. We\u0027ll need time to get in position.\"\n Olivetti nodded vaguely but said nothing for many moments. He ran a finger back and forth across the dash, making a line in the dust. He studied Langdon in the side-view mirror, and Langdon felt himself being measured and weighed. Finally Olivetti turned back to the guard. There was reluctance in his voice. \"I\u0027ll want separate approaches. Cars to Piazza della Rotunda, Via delgi Orfani, Piazza Sant\u0027Ignacio, and Sant\u0027Eustachio. No closer than two blocks. Once you\u0027re parked, gear up and await my orders. Three minutes.\"\n \"Very good, sir.\" The soldier returned to his car.\n Langdon gave Vittoria an impressed nod. She smiled back, and for an instant Langdon felt an unexpected connection... a thread of magnetism between them.\n The commander turned in his seat and locked eyes with Langdon. \"Mr. Langdon, this had better not blow up in our faces.\"\n Langdon smiled uneasily. How could it?\n 57\n The director of CERN, Maximilian Kohler, opened his eyes to the cool rush of cromolyn and leukotriene in his body, dilating his bronchial tubes and pulmonary capillaries. He was breathing normally again. He found himself lying in a private room in the CERN infirmary, his wheelchair beside the bed.\n He took stock, examining the paper robe they had put him in. His clothing was folded on the chair beside the bed. Outside he could hear a nurse making the rounds. He lay there a long minute listening. Then, as quietly as possible, he pulled himself to the edge of the bed and retrieved his clothing. Struggling with his dead legs, he dressed himself. Then he dragged his body onto his wheelchair.\n Muffling a cough, he wheeled himself to the door. He moved manually, careful not to engage the motor. When he arrived at the door he peered out. The hall was empty.\n Silently, Maximilian Kohler slipped out of the infirmary. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/angels-demons-robert-langdon-1/page-17.html","bookId":2228,"book":{"id":2228,"title":"Angels Demons (Robert Langdon #1)","description":"Storyline: \n World-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist.
