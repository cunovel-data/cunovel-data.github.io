He stared up in terror at the dark figure looming over him. \"What do you want!\" \"La chiave,\" the raspy voice replied. \"The password.\" \"But... I don\u0027t - \" The intruder pressed down again, grinding the white hot object deeper into Vetra\u0027s chest. There was the hiss of broiling flesh. Vetra cried out in agony. \"There is no password!\" He felt himself drifting toward unconsciousness. The figure glared. \"Ne avevo paura. I was afraid of that.\" Vetra fought to keep his senses, but the darkness was closing in. His only solace was in knowing his attacker would never obtain what he had come for. A moment later, however, the figure produced a blade and brought it to Vetra\u0027s face. The blade hovered. Carefully. Surgically. \"For the love of God!\" Vetra screamed. But it was too late.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/angels-demons-robert-langdon-1/page-1.html","bookId":2228,"book":{"id":2228,"title":"Angels Demons (Robert Langdon #1)","description":"Storyline: World-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist.
