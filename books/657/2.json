It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n And rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently Peter sneezed—\u0027Kertyschoo!\u0027 Mr. McGregor was after him in no time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. He went back to his work. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can. \\n\\n \\n\\n After a time he began to wander about, going lippity—lippity—not very fast, and looking all round. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1526/45554.html","bookId":657,"book":{"id":657,"title":"The Tale of Peter Rabbit","description":"简介： The Tale of Peter Rabbit first appeared in 1902 and made its author, Beatrix Potter, a household name.
