{"id":1393,"no":37,"title":"Chapter 36","content":"Tiresias Tiresias was a blind，darkseeing prophet of Thebes．Hewas struck with blindness in his youth，because he had spied unwittingly on the goddess Athena．He was wandering in the woods one day when quite unexpectedly he saw anaked maiden bathing in a placid lake ．Little did he know that he had offended the virgin goddess．Taken unaware and scarlet with wrath，the goddess exclaimed that whoever had the boldness to steal a glance at her naked body was doomed to perpetual blindness．But when she learned later that the offence was unintentional ，it was too late for her to take back what she had said．Taking pity on the poor youth for the loss of his sight，she obtained from Zeus an exceptional long life for him，and from Apollo a divine power of prophecy．Besides，she provided him with a marvellous sharpness of ear，so that he could under stand the voices of all birds．And she filled his mind with mystic knowledge of things past and of things to come．In short shegave him quite an amount of her own wisdom．He was the firstto recognise and welcome Dionysus，god of feast and wine，on the The ban land．When the infant Heracles caught Hera\u0027s two serpents in its hands，it was Tiresias who cast the child\u0027s fortune and revealed the divine origin and destiny of the boy ．When Oedipus abused Tiresias as having had a hand in themurder of Laius，Tiresias had the fearless courage to tell thetruth that Oedipus was the murderer．Even in the lower world he continued to prophesy．There he helped Odysseus when the hero came to him for advice．Alive，he was highly respected byall；dead，he enjoyed the generous air and rosy light in the land of the Blest． 36 泰瑞西斯 泰瑞西斯是位只能看见黑暗的底比斯先知。由于他年轻时不小心窥见了女神雅典娜，他的双目失明。一天，他在森林里漫步时，意外地看见一位全身裸露的仙女正在平静的湖水中沐浴。他不知道他已经冒犯了这位贞洁的女神。因莫名其妙地被人看了个一清二楚，女神勃然大怒。她诅咒道：谁胆敢偷看她的玉体，谁就必将永远变瞎。但当后来她得知泰瑞西斯并非有意冒犯她时，再想收回她的咒语已经不可能了。出于怜悯，她从宙斯那里替这位贫穷的，丧失了视力的年轻人争取到了长寿；又从阿波罗那里要来了神圣的预言本领；并且，她赋予他神奇敏锐的双耳，这样他就可以明白各种鸟语。此外，雅典娜给了他魔术般的本领，使他既知过去，也能预测未来。总而言之，她使他拥有了她自身智慧中的很大一部分。在底比斯，是泰瑞西斯第一个认出了宴会神、也是酒神的狄俄尼索斯，并向他表示欢迎。当海格克斯还是个婴儿，用手抓起赫拉的两条毒蛇时，也正是泰瑞西斯卜算出了这个孩子的未来并预示出他的出身及其命运。当奥狄浦斯指责泰瑞西斯参与谋杀了拉伊俄斯时，泰瑞西斯勇敢地讲出了事实真相：奥狄浦斯才是凶手。即使到了地狱，他依然预测未来。在那儿，当奥德修斯前去征求他的意见时，泰瑞西斯帮助了他。活着的时候，他受到人们的普遍敬重；死后，在不莱斯特这块土地上，他享受着无比清新的空气和玫瑰般绚丽多彩的阳光。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/923/28620.html","bookId":49,"book":{"id":49,"title":"Ancient Greek Myths 古希腊神话","description":"简介： 希腊神话即口头或文字上一切有关古希腊人的神、英雄、自然和宇宙历史的神话。原始氏族社会的精神产物，欧洲最早的文学形式。大约产生于公元前8世纪以前，它在希腊原始初民长期...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/923","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
