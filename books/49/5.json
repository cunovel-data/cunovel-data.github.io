{"id":1361,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"5 Nereus and Proteus\n \n Of all the small sea divinities Nereus and Proteus stood out as Peculiar sea-gods．Nereus，known as“the Old Man of the sea”，represented the pleasant aspect of ocean waters．He lived beneath the sea with his fifty lovely daughters，of whom the most famous were Amphritrite，Thetis，Galate a and Panope．It was Nereus who advised Heracles to seek Prometheus in the hero\u0027s search of the golden apples．\n Proteus was Poseidon\u0027s herdsman. He was well known for two qualities：the gift of prophecy and the power to take various forms．At one time he was a lion with a curly wavy hairs；at another he appeared in the shape of a wild boar；and still another he stood a stately tree covered with rich leaves．When，after all these and many other changes，he failed to get rid of his questioner， the god offered detailed answers．\n \n 在所有的小海神中，纳鲁斯和普鲁吐斯异常独特。纳鲁斯是人们熟知的“海中的老人”。他代表了海水友善的一面。他和50个可爱的女儿一起生活在海中。她们当中最著名的有；安菲瑞垂托、塞提丝、盖拉蒂和潘诺珀。在勇敢地寻觅金苹果的时候，纳鲁斯建议赫格立斯寻找普罗米修斯。\n 普鲁吐斯是波塞冬的牧羊人。他有两种非凡的能力：他能预言，他还能够变成不同的动物。有时他是一头狮子，有着波浪般的卷发。有时他是一头凶猛的野猪。而有时他又是一棵枝叶繁茂、外表威严的大树。经过这些变化之后，当他无法摆脱询问者时，神就替他作出详尽的回答。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/923/3974.html","bookId":49,"book":{"id":49,"title":"Ancient Greek Myths 古希腊神话","description":"简介： 希腊神话即口头或文字上一切有关古希腊人的神、英雄、自然和宇宙历史的神话。原始氏族社会的精神产物，欧洲最早的文学形式。大约产生于公元前8世纪以前，它在希腊原始初民长期...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/923","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
