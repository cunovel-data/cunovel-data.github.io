在新婚宴会上，不和女神厄里斯抛出一只写有“献给最美丽的人”字样的金苹果。赫拉、阿芙罗狄蒂和雅典娜都希望得到这只金苹果。她们被送到帕里斯那里以做出裁决。帕里斯是爱达山上的一个牧羊人，他把金苹果判给了阿芙罗狄蒂，因为她答应帮他得到世上最美丽女子的爱。 帕里斯是特洛伊国王皮安姆的儿子。他出生时，他的母亲赫尔犹巴王后梦到自己手握一根燃木；因此，人们认为帕里斯很可能会给城市带来毁灭。一个很偶然的机会，他被遗弃在爱达山上，在那经受了风吹、雨淋和日晒。后来，他被那里的牧民救了下来并抚养成人。这次，在阿芙罗狄蒂的授意下，他下山参加在特洛伊城举办的集会。在那里，他是如此的出众，国王皮安姆和王后赫尔犹巴兴高采烈地接纳了他，他重新成为王室家族的一员。 不久，他被任命为船队首领，并被派往希腊。他来到斯巴达，因为阿芙罗狄蒂曾经告诉他，当时最美的女子——海伦就住在那儿。海伦的丈夫，墨涅劳斯国王热情地款待了帕里斯，但他却恩将仇报。趁着国王不在，帕里斯说服海伦与他一起私奔到特洛伊城。为了报仇雪恨，希腊人民拿起了武器，特洛伊战争爆发了。 当希腊舰队停驻在奥利斯海港时，风向一直不顺。一位先知告诉远征军的统帅阿伽门农，让他牺牲自己的女儿伊菲革涅亚，把她献给阿耳特弥斯。伊菲革涅亚被摆到了女神祭坛上。但是阿耳特弥斯在最后关头将她带走了，并将一只鹿放到她的位置上。阿伽门农的妻子克吕泰涅斯特拉对丈夫的残忍深感愤怒。 战争持续了十年。在这段时间里，双方损失惨重。阿伽门农与阿基里斯争夺一位俘获的公主。暴怒之下，阿基里斯拒绝继续参战。阿基里斯的朋友，普特洛克勒斯借走了他的盔甲以扭转战局。很不幸，他死在了皮安姆的大儿子海克特的手下。阿基里斯一心一意要为朋友报仇，他不再与阿伽门农斗气。披上赫斐斯塔司为他赶制的新盔甲，他出征了。他杀死了海克特，拖着尸体绕特洛伊城跑了三圈。但很快，阿基里斯又被帕里斯射中了脚跟，死在战场上。帕里斯也没活多久，他又被阿基里斯的朋友杀死了。由于阿基里斯遗言要把他的盔甲送给希腊最勇敢的战士，在两位得此称号的勇士间展开了激烈的争夺。当盔甲最后判定应奖给奥德修斯时，另一位勇士埃杰克斯郁郁寡欢，羞愧万分地结束了他的生命。 当仗打到第九年年底的时候，一位先知预言，只要城里的雅典娜神像在，特洛伊城就永远不会被攻陷。于是，奥德修斯就和狄俄墨得斯伪装入城，偷偷地将神像盗了出来。随后，希腊人精心制作了一匹庞大的木马，一些希腊士兵藏进了马腹。与此同时，希腊军队假装撤兵，并散布谣言：这匹马是雅典娜送来的。信以为真的特洛伊人欢天喜地地将马拖进城里。夜幕降临，隐藏的希腊士兵们蹑手蹑脚地从马肚里钻出来，使整个城市陷入一片混乱之中。特洛伊城被洗劫一空。国王皮安姆被杀，赫克犹巴王后，她的女儿卡珊德拉及儿媳安德洛玛切都被充作了奴隶。海伦和墨涅劳斯重归于好，到西方隐居了起来。阿伽门农返回锡尼，却不幸遭到自己妻子的谋杀。他的儿子杀死了自己的母亲，又被愤怒女神追捕。奥德修斯历尽艰难险阻，与大风大浪搏击着，直到他最终到达伊塞沙，与忠实的妻子珀涅罗珀团聚在一起。特洛伊城的一位王子埃厄安斯幸免于难。很长一段时间，他从一个国家流浪到另一个国家。最后，他创建了罗马民族。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/923/28638.html","bookId":49,"book":{"id":49,"title":"Ancient
