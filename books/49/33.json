{"id":1389,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"32 Artemis\n \n Apollo drove his golden carriage across the heavens during the day，admired as the sun-god．Artemis also raced across the sky in solemn style at night，respected as the moon-goddess．Sitting in an airy carriage drawn by milk white horses，“the queen of wide air” gave off silver light all over the sleeping world below．Though she remained single all her life，the maiden heart of the goddess was at least for once excited as she saw the beautiful youth Endymion sleeping．\n She was pure and fair and calm．She was the example of maiden modesty and grace．Just as Apollo represents manly beauty，so Artemis stands for feminine purity and virginity ．As their patron goddess she took it as her duty to protect marrying girls and young women in trouble．It was her altar that those maidens turned for love and happiness．\n The twin sister of Apollo was also the goddess of hunting and wild life ．Dressed in a short hunting-suit coming up to the knee and followed by a team of noisy lovely fairy maidens，Artemis had always her bow of pearl and shining arrow with her and travelled in the woods in search of wild animals．When she felt hot and tired she would retire to a spring to take a bath．It was here that young Actaeon accidentally came and suffered cruel treatment at the hands of the goddess．Indeed，the goddesscould be thoroughly heartless and stopped to be lovely as soon as the bad side of her nature got the upper hand in her．The sadthing of Niobe was just a case in point．\n \n 32 阿尔特弥斯\n \n 白天阿波罗驾驶着金色战车穿越天空，被仰慕为太阳神。晚上，阿尔特弥斯以庄重的姿态飞越夜空，被敬仰为月亮女神。坐在乳白色战马驱动的空中马车中，这位“广阔天空的王后”向沉睡的大地散发出银色的光芒。她终身未嫁，但至少有一次当她看到英俊的恩底弥翁酣睡时，女神萌发了爱慕之情。\n 阿尔特弥斯心灵纯洁，容貌娟秀安祥。她是少女端庄娴雅的楷模。如果说阿波罗代表了男性美，那么她则象征着女性美——贞洁。作为守护神，她把保护困境之中的待嫁女子当作自己义不容辞的责任。少女们都来到她的圣坛前祈求爱情与幸福。\n 作为阿波罗的孪生妹妹，她也是狩猎女神。她身穿及膝的短猎装，有喧闹可爱的仙女尾随身后。阿尔特弥斯总是手持珍珠色的弓和发亮的箭，在林中漫游，寻找猎物。当她又累又热时，就来到泉水旁沐浴。而当阿卡同无意间来到这里时，却遭到了女神的虐待。事实上，当凶残的一面占了上风时，女神就会变得残酷无情。阿卡同的遭遇正说明了这一点。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/923/4002.html","bookId":49,"book":{"id":49,"title":"Ancient Greek Myths 古希腊神话","description":"简介： 希腊神话即口头或文字上一切有关古希腊人的神、英雄、自然和宇宙历史的神话。原始氏族社会的精神产物，欧洲最早的文学形式。大约产生于公元前8世纪以前，它在希腊原始初民长期...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/923","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
