{"id":1397,"no":41,"title":"Chapter 40","content":"Baucis and Philemon As was the common practice with the gods of Olympus，Zeus and Hermes were visiting the world in disguise．One day they came to a village．At a thousand house sthey knocked，and a thousand times they were refused rest and food and drink．At last they arrived at a humble cottage，where the old couple Baucis and her husband Philemon lived．Poor but at peace with world，they made the best of what life could offer them ，and felt truly grateful to the gods above．When the two travellers entered the hut，the old couple were glad with lively happiness．They offered their guests their best seat，and immediately set about preparing dinner for them．With no small difficulty they made fire，brought in a fresh cabbage，cut a fat piece of their long kept meat and put them over the fire to cook．The one single goose they were ready to kill for the visitors，but it was saved at the last minute by the guests．The dining bench was a makeshift ，poor and patched but the best they had．The table was supported by a brick．The feast was quite modest，eggs and wine and cot tage cheese，and a variety of newly pickedfruit．The old couple humbly waited on the visiting guests withsincere looks and eager goodwill．Moved at the hospitality ofthe house，the gods told their true identity．“We are gods”，saidZeus．“While the neigh bour hood pays the penalty for itswickedness you shall be free from misfortune．Coming along with us”．When they were near the top of the hill，Bancis and Phile mon looked back and saw all the village below covered by amarsh ，and that among the general ruin and destruction their old cottage alone survived，changed into a grand temple．At their request they were made the guardians of the sacred place of Zeus．When their span of worldly life came to an end they were turned into an ash and linden，standing side by side in front of the temple． 40 鲍西丝和费莱蒙 奥林波斯山上的神都喜欢乔装改扮到人间察看。有一天，宙斯和海尔墨斯乔装来到一个村子里。他们敲了许多人家的门，希望能歇歇脚，讨点食物，却一次又一次地被拒之门外。最后他们来到一间简陋的小茅屋前，这里住着鲍西丝和她的老伴费莱蒙，老俩口虽一贫如洗，却也乐天知足，与世无争。他们享尽了生活所赋予的一切，并对上天充满了感激之情。当二神来到他们家时，老俩口满怀喜悦，笑逐颜开。他们将二神视为稀客，并立刻开始为他们准备晚餐。他们点燃火，摘回一棵白菜，又切下一块贮存很久的咸肥肉，放在火上烤。正当他们宰杀仅剩的一只鹅时，客人婉言地阻止了他们。餐凳只是临时的代用品，陈旧不堪，到处是修补的痕迹，但对他们来说已是最好的了。桌子是用一块砖头撑着。饭菜非常普通，有鸡蛋、葡萄酒和土制奶酪，以及多种新鲜水果。二老笑容可掬、殷勤备至地服待天神用饭。两位天神深深地被他们的盛情款待所感动，说明了自己的真实身分。“我们是天神”宙斯说，“你们将脱离不幸，但你们的邻人们将因他们的邪恶受到惩罚。跟我们走吧！”当他们快到奥林波斯山顶时，鲍西丝和费莱蒙回头看见整个村庄淹没在一片沼泽之中；而他们的旧茅屋却始终完好无损，并且变成了一座金碧辉煌的神殿。出于二老的要求，他们被指派为宙斯所住宫殿的看护者。随着俩个凡人生活的结束，他们变成了白蜡树和菩提树，并肩站在神殿前。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/923/28624.html","bookId":49,"book":{"id":49,"title":"Ancient Greek Myths 古希腊神话","description":"简介： 希腊神话即口头或文字上一切有关古希腊人的神、英雄、自然和宇宙历史的神话。原始氏族社会的精神产物，欧洲最早的文学形式。大约产生于公元前8世纪以前，它在希腊原始初民长期...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/923","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM"}}
