Judging by his own interpretation of the discovery our hero was not surprised that his captor should be incensed. He retraced his steps, and found himself once more in the subterranean chamber facing an angry man. \"What took you in there?\" demanded Colonel Johnson. \"Curiosity, I suppose,\" answered Grit composedly. He felt that he was in a scrape, but he was not a boy to show fear or confusion. \"How did you happen to discover the entrance?\" \"It was quite accidental. I was pacing the floor to see how wide the room was, when my hand touched the spring.\" \"Why did you want to know the width of the room?\" asked Johnson suspiciously. \"I didn\u0027t care much to know, but the time hung heavily on my hands, and that was one way of filling it up.\" Colonel Johnson eyed the boy attentively. He was at a loss to know whether Grit really suspected the nature and meaning of his [Pg 275]discovery, or not. If not, he didn\u0027t wish to excite suspicion in the boy\u0027s mind. He decided to insinuate an explanation. \"I suppose you were surprised to find the passageway,\" he remarked. \"Yes, sir.\" \"As you have always lived in the country, that is natural. Such arrangements are common enough in the city.\" \"I wonder whether trap doors are common,\" thought Grit, but he did not give expression to his thought. \"The room into which you looked is under the house of my brother-in-law, and the passage affords an easy mode of entrance.\" \"I should think it would be easier going into the street,\" thought Grit. \"Still I am annoyed at your meddlesome curiosity, and shall take measures to prevent your gratifying it again. I had a great mind when I first saw you to shut you up in the passage. I fancy you wouldn\u0027t enjoy that.\" \"I certainly shouldn\u0027t,\" said Grit, smiling. \"I will have some consideration for you, and put a stop to your wanderings in another way.\" As he spoke he drew from his pocket a thick, stout cord, and directing Grit to hold his hands together, proceeded to tie his wrists.[Pg 276] This our hero naturally regarded as distasteful. \"You need not do this,\" he said. \"I will promise not to go into the passage.\" \"Humph! Will you promise not to attempt to escape?\" \"No, sir, I can\u0027t promise that.\" \"Ha! you mean, then, to attempt to escape?\" \"Of course!\" answered Grit. \"I should be a fool to stay here if any chance offered of getting away.\" \"You are candid, young man,\" returned Johnson. \"There is no earthly chance of your escaping. Still, I may as well make sure. Put out your feet.\" \"You are not going to tie my feet, too, are you?\" asked Grit, in some dismay. \"To be sure I am. I can\u0027t trust you after what you have done this morning.\" It was of no use to resist, for Colonel Johnson was a powerful man, and Grit, though strong, only a boy of sixteen. \"This doesn\u0027t look much like escaping,\" thought Grit. \"I hope he won\u0027t search my pockets and discover my knife. If I can get hold of that, I may be able to release myself.\" Colonel Johnson had just completed tying the last knot when the door, which had been[Pg 277] left unbolted, was seen to open, and the half-witted boy, Daniel, entered hastily. \"How now, idiot!\" said Johnson harshly. \"What brings you here?\" \"There\u0027s a gentleman up-stairs wants to see you, master,\" said Daniel, with the scared look with which he always regarded his tyrant. \"A gentleman!\" repeated Johnson hastily. \"Who let him in?\" \"I did, sir.\" \"You did!\" thundered Johnson. \"How often have I told you to let in nobody? Do you want me to choke you?\" \"I—forgot,\" faltered the boy. \"Besides, he said he wanted to see you particular.\" \"All the more reason why I don\u0027t want to see him. What does he look like?\" \"He\u0027s a small man, sir.\" \"Humph! Where did you leave him?\" \"Room above, sir.\" \"I\u0027ll go up and see him. If it\u0027s somebody I don\u0027t want to see, I\u0027ll choke you.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Daniel humbly. As Johnson went out, Daniel lingered a moment, and, in a hoarse whisper, said to Grit: \"It\u0027s him.\" \"Who is it?\" asked Grit puzzled. \"It\u0027s the man you sent me to.\" [Pg 278] \"Good! You\u0027re a trump, Daniel,\" said Grit joyfully. A minute after a confused noise was heard in the room above. Daniel turned pale. \"Tell him where I am, Daniel,\" said Grit, as the boy timidly left the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81881.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
