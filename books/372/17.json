{"id":10955,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. AN UNWELCOME VISITOR.","content":"Mrs. Brandon was laying the cloth for dinner when she heard a scuffling sound, as of footsteps, in the entry. \"Who is with Mr. Brandon?\" she thought. \"It can\u0027t be Grit. They wouldn\u0027t be likely to come home together.\" Her uncertainty was soon at an end, for the door was opened, and her husband reeled in, sinking into the nearest chair, of necessity, for his limbs refused to support him. Just behind him was Mr. Thomas Travers, who was also under the influence of his recent potations, but not to the same extent as his companion. \"How do, Mrs. B.?\" said her liege lord. \"Mrs. B., I have the pleasure of introducin\u0027 my frien\u0027 Travers. Come in, Travers.\" Mrs. Brandon surveyed the two with a look of disgust, and did not speak. \"I hope I see you well, ma\u0027am,\" said Travers, rather awkwardly, endeavoring, with some difficulty, to maintain an erect attitude. \"Sorry to intrude, but my old friend Brandon insisted.\" [Pg 120] \"You can come in if you like,\" said Mrs. Brandon coldly. \"I say, Mrs. B., is dinner almost ready? My frien\u0027, Mr. Travers, is hungry, an\u0027 so\u0027m I.\" \"Dinner is nearly ready. I suppose, Mr. Brandon, you have just come from the tavern.\" \"Yes, Mrs. B., I\u0027ve come from the tavern,\" hiccoughed Brandon. \"Have you anything to say against it?\" \"I would say something if it would do any good,\" said his wife despondently. \"If you think—hic—that I\u0027ve been drinking Mrs. B., you\u0027re mistaken; ain\u0027t she, Travers?\" \"You didn\u0027t drink enough to hurt you, Brandon,\" said his companion, coming to his assistance. Mrs. Brandon looked at Travers, but did not deign to answer him. It was clear that his assurance possessed no value in her eyes. She continued her preparations, and laid the dinner on the table. Then she went to the door, and, shading her eyes, looked out, hoping to see Grit on his way home. But she looked in vain. Just as he was about fastening his boat, or, rather, the boat he had borrowed, two passengers came up and wished to be conveyed across the river. [Pg 121] \"My dinner can wait,\" thought Grit. \"I must not disappoint passengers.\" So his coming home was delayed, and Brandon and his friend had the field to themselves. When dinner was ready, Brandon staggered to the table and seated himself. \"Sit down, Travers,\" he said. \"You\u0027re in my house, and you must make yourself at home.\" He said this a little defiantly, for he saw by Mrs. Brandon\u0027s expression that she was not pleased with his friend\u0027s presence. \"I\u0027m glad to hear it,\" said Travers, with a knowing smile. \"I was told that the house belonged to your wife.\" \"It\u0027s the same thing, isn\u0027t it, Mrs. B.?\" returned Brandon. \"Not quite,\" answered his wife bitterly. \"If it were, we should not have a roof over our heads.\" \"There you go again!\" said Brandon fiercely, pounding the table with the handle of his knife. \"Don\u0027t let me hear no more such talk. I\u0027m master here, d\u0027ye hear that?\" \"That\u0027s the talk, Brandon!\" said Travers approvingly. \"I like to hear a man show proper independence. Of course you\u0027re master here.\" [Pg 122] Mrs. Brandon was of a gentle nature, but she was roused to resentment by this rudeness. Turning to Travers, she said: \"I don\u0027t know who you are, sir, but your remarks are offensive and displeasing.\" \"I\u0027m the friend of my friend Brandon,\" said Travers insolently, \"and as long as he don\u0027t complain of my remarks, I shall remark what I please. What d\u0027ye say, Brandon?\" \"Quite right, Travers, old boy! You\u0027re in my house, and I expect you to be treated accordingly. Mrs. B., you will be kind enough to remember that this gen\u0027leman is a frien\u0027 of mine,\" and Brandon closed the sentence with a drunken hiccough. \"I think it necessary to say that this house belongs to me,\" said Mrs. Brandon, \"and that no one is welcome here who does not treat me with respect.\" \"Spunky, eh?\" said Travers, laughing rudely. \"Yes, she\u0027s spunky,\" said Brandon, \"but we\u0027ll cure her of that, eh, Travers?—the same way as I cured that boy of hers.\" \"That was good!\" laughed Travers. \"He\u0027s an impudent young rascal.\" Mrs. Brandon was alarmed. What did they mean by these references? What had been[Pg 123] done to Grit, and how had he been served? Was it possible that Brandon had dared to use violence to the boy? The very thought hardened her, and gave her courage. \"Mr. Brandon,\" she said, with flashing eyes, \"what do you mean? What have you done to Grit? Have you dared to illtreat him? If you have, it will be a bad day\u0027s work for you.\" \"Ha! She threatens you, Brandon. Now, brace up, man, and show your spunk,\" said Travers, enjoying the scene. \"I\u0027m not accountable to you, Mrs. B.,\" stammered Brandon, in what he essayed to make a dignified tone. \"Grit is my stepson, and I\u0027m his natural guardian.\" \"Mr. Brandon, what have you done to Grit?\" persisted his wife, with flashing eyes. \"Have you dared to lay a finger upon him?\" \"I\u0027ll lay two fingers, three fingers, on him, if I like,\" said Brandon doggedly. \"He\u0027s a sassy puppy, Mrs. B.\" Mrs. Brandon became more and more anxious. Generally, Grit was home by this time, and his failure to appear led the anxious mother to conclude that he had been injured by her husband. \"Where is Grit?\" she asked, with startling emphasis. [Pg 124] \"He\u0027s all right,\" stammered Brandon. \"He\u0027s all right, but he isn\u0027t happy,\" said Travers, laughing. \"That was a good move of yours, selling his boat.\" \"Did you sell Grit\u0027s boat, Mr. Brandon?\" demanded his wife quickly. \"Yes, I did, Mrs. B. Have you got anything to say against it?\" \"I say that it was a mean, contemptible, dishonest act!\" said Mrs. Brandon warmly. \"You have taken away the poor boy\u0027s means of living, in order to gratify your love of drink. The food which you are eating was bought with his earnings. How do you expect to live, now that you have taken away his boat?\" \"He\u0027ll get along; he\u0027s got sixty dollars,\" said Brandon thickly. \"Sixty dollars won\u0027t last forever. To whom did you sell the boat?\" \"Phil Courtney.\" \"He was just the boy to buy it. Little he cared for the harm he was doing my poor Grit. How much did he pay you?\" \"Five dollars.\" \"And how much of the money have you got left?\" Brandon drew out two silver half-dollars from his pocket. [Pg 125] \"That\u0027s all I\u0027ve got left,\" he said. \"And you have actually squandered four dollars on liquor, you and your friend!\" said Mrs. Brandon—\"nearly the whole sum you received for my poor boy\u0027s boat!\" \"Hush up, Mrs. B.! It\u0027s none of your business,\" said Brandon. \"That\u0027s the way to talk, Brandon!\" said Travers, surveying the scene with boorish delight. \"I like to see a man show the proper spirit of a man. I like to see a man master in his own house.\" \"You would not insult me so if Grit were here!\" said Mrs. Brandon, with a red spot on either cheek. \"Mr. Brandon, I tolerate your presence here, because I was foolish enough to accept you as my husband. As for this man whom you have brought here, he is unwelcome. He has dared to insult me while sitting at my table, and I ask him in your presence to leave the house.\" \"Travers is my frien\u0027; he will stay here, Mrs. B., and don\u0027t you forget it!\" Brandon pounded the table as he spoke, and nodded his head vigorously. \"Sorry to disappoint you, Mrs. Brandon,\" said Travers impudently, \"but when my friend Brandon tells me to stay, stay I must. If you[Pg 126] don\u0027t enjoy my being here, let me suggest to you, in the politest manner, to go and take a walk. Eh, Brandon?\" \"Yes, go take a walk!\" said Brandon, echoing his friend\u0027s remark. \"I\u0027ll have you to know, Mrs. B., that this is my house, an\u0027 I am master here. My frien\u0027 Travers will stay here as long as he pleases.\" \"That\u0027s the talk, Brandon. I knew you weren\u0027t under petticoat government. You\u0027re too much of a man for that.\" \"Yesh, I\u0027m too much of a man for that,\" said Brandon sleepily. Travers took from his pocket a clay pipe, and, deliberately filling the bowl with tobacco, began to smoke. As he leaned back in his chair, winking insolently at Mrs. Brandon, the poor woman cried: \"Will no one relieve me from this insolent intruder?\" The words caught the ears of Grit, who entered at this moment. He looked from one to the other of the two men who sat at his mother\u0027s table, and his eyes flashed, and his boyish form dilated with passion. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81859.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
