{"id":10963,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. MRS. BRANDON IS MYSTIFIED.","content":"When Grit explained to his mother that he was going away for a day or two on a journey, she was naturally surprised, and asked for particulars. \"I should like to tell you, mother,\" said the young boatman, \"but there are reasons why I cannot. It is a secret mission, and the secret is not mine.\" \"That is perfectly satisfactory, Grit,\" said Mrs. Brandon. \"I have full confidence in you, and know I can trust you.\" \"After I return I shall probably be able to tell you all,\" said Grit. \"Meanwhile, I shall, no doubt, be paid better than if I were ferrying passengers across the river.\" \"At any rate, I shall be glad to see you back. We have not been separated for a night for years, or, indeed, since you were born.\" [Pg 183] The next day, Mr. Brandon, taught by experience that he need not look for his meals at home, went over to the tavern to breakfast. He felt unusually independent and elated, for he had money in his pocket, obtained from Colonel Johnson, and he expected soon to receive the handsome sum of five thousand dollars. A shrewder man, in order to avert suspicion, would have held his tongue, at least until he had performed the service for which he was to be so liberally paid; but Brandon could not forego the opportunity to boast a little. \"It is quite possible, Mrs. B.,\" he said, in the morning, \"that I may leave you in a day or two, to be gone a considerable time.\" Mrs. B. did not show the expected curiosity, but received the communication in silence. \"You don\u0027t inquire where I am going,\" said Brandon. \"Where do you propose to go?\" asked his wife, whose chief feeling was that she and Grit would now be left to their old quiet and peace. \"I may go to Europe,\" said Mr. Brandon, in an important tone. \"Isn\u0027t this a new plan?\" asked Mrs. Brandon, really surprised. \"Yes, it is new. I shall go on business,[Pg 184] Mrs. B. My friend Travers and I will probably go together. You and Grit made a great mistake when you treated him with rudeness. It is through him that I am offered most remunerative employment.\" \"I don\u0027t enjoy the society of your friend,\" said Mrs. Brandon. \"If he is likely to give you a chance to earn something, I am glad, but that does not excuse the rudeness with which he treated me.\" \"My friend Travers is a gentleman, Mrs. B., a high-toned gentleman, and if you had treated him with the respect which is his due, you would have had nothing to complain of. As it is, you may soon discover that you have made a mistake, and lost a great pleasure. I had not intended to tell you, but I am tempted to do so, that but for your impoliteness to Travers, I might have taken you and Grit with me on a European tour.\" Mr. Brandon watched his wife, to see if she exhibited severe disappointment at the dazzling prospect which was no sooner shown than withdrawn, but she showed her usual equanimity. \"Grit and I will be quite as happy at home,\" she answered. \"Sour grapes!\" thought Brandon, but he was wrong. A tour of Europe taken in his[Pg 185] company would have no attractions for his wife. \"Very well,\" said Brandon. \"You and Grit are welcome to the charms of Pine Point. As for me, it is too small and contracted for a man of my business capacity.\" \"I wonder whether there is any truth in what he says,\" thought Mrs. Brandon, puzzled. \"Your business seems a profitable one,\" she ventured to remark. \"It is, Mrs. B.,\" answered her husband. \"It is of an unusually delicate nature, and requires business talents of a high order.\" \"Your friend Travers does not impress one as a man possessed of a high order of business talent,\" said Mrs. Brandon. \"That is where you fail to appreciate him, but I cannot say more. My business is secret, and cannot be revealed.\" So saying, Brandon took his hat, and with a jaunty step walked to the hotel. \"More secrecy!\" thought Mrs. Brandon. \"Grit tells me that his mission is a secret one, and now Mr. Brandon says he, too, is engaged in something that cannot be revealed. I know that it is all right with Grit, but I do not feel so sure about Mr. Brandon.\" The day passed as usual. Grit plied his[Pg 186] boat on the river, and did a fair day\u0027s work. But about four o\u0027clock he came home. \"You are home early, Grit,\" said his mother. \"Yes, for I must get ready to go.\" He had not yet mentioned to his mother when he was to start. \"Do you go to-morrow morning?\" asked Mrs. Brandon. \"I go to-night, and may be away for a couple of days, mother.\" Mrs. Brandon uttered an exclamation of surprise. \"I suppose I must not ask you where you are going,\" said his mother. \"I cannot tell, for it is somebody else\u0027s secret. One thing more, will you take care to say as little as possible about my going away? I would rather Mr. Brandon should not know of it.\" \"I will do as you wish, Grit. By the way, Mr. Brandon tells me he is soon going to Europe.\" Grit smiled. He knew where the money was to come from, which his stepfather depended upon to defray the expenses of a foreign journey. \"I don\u0027t feel sure about his going, mother,\" he answered. [Pg 187] \"He said he would have taken you and me if we had treated his friend Travers more politely.\" \"Well, mother, we must reconcile ourselves as well as we can to staying at home.\" \"Home will be happy while I have you with me, Grit.\" \"And Mr. Brandon away,\" added the young boatman. \"Yes; I can\u0027t help hoping that he will be able to carry out his purpose, and go to Europe, or somewhere else as far off.\" \"I think it very likely we sha\u0027n\u0027t see him again for some time,\" said Grit, \"though I don\u0027t think he will be traveling in Europe.\" \"As you and Mr. Brandon are both to be engaged in business of a secret nature,\" said Mrs. Brandon, smiling, \"I don\u0027t know but I ought to follow your example.\" \"I have full confidence in you, mother, whatever you undertake,\" said Grit, with a laugh, repeating his mother\u0027s own words. Evening came on, and Grit stole out of the house early, lest his stepfather might by some chance return home, and suspect something from his unusual journey. He need not have been alarmed, for Brandon did not leave the tavern till ten o\u0027clock,[Pg 188] though he, too, expected to leave town the next morning. When he returned he didn\u0027t inquire for Grit, whom he supposed to be abed and asleep. \"Mrs. B.,\" he said, \"I must trouble you to wake me at seven o\u0027clock to-morrow morning. I am going to take the early train to Portland.\" \"Very well.\" \"And as it will be rather inconvenient for me to go out to breakfast, I would be glad if you would give me some breakfast before I go.\" \"I will do so,\" said his wife. \"It may be some time before I see you again, as I am to go away on business.\" \"I hope you may be successful,\" said Mrs. Brandon. Brandon laughed queerly. \"If the old lady knew that I was going to steal some government bonds, she would hesitate a little before she wished me success,\" he thought, but he said: \"Thank you, Mrs. B., your good wishes are appreciated, and I may hereafter be able to show my appreciation in a substantial way. I suppose Grit is asleep.\" Mrs. Brandon did not answer, finding the question an embarrassing one. [Pg 189] The next morning Brandon, contrary to his wont, showed considerable alacrity in dressing, and did justice to the breakfast his wife had set before him. \"Well, good-bye, Mrs. B.,\" he said, as he took his hat and prepared to leave the house. \"Perhaps I had better go up-stairs and bid good-by to Grit, as I may not see him again for some time.\" \"Grit is out,\" said Mrs. Brandon hastily, for she did not wish her husband to go up to Grit\u0027s room, as he would discover that his bed had not been slept in. \"Out already?\" said Brandon. \"He\u0027s made an early start. Well, bid him good-by for me.\" \"It\u0027s very strange,\" repeated Mrs. Brandon, as she cleared away the breakfast dishes; \"there\u0027s Grit gone, I don\u0027t know where, and now Mr. Brandon has started off on some mysterious business. What can it all mean?\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81867.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
