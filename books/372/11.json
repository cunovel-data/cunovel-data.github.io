{"id":10949,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI. THE MIDNIGHT VISIT.","content":"Grit was not aware that Brandon had discovered his secret, but still was not unprepared for a night visit. As we already know, he had but ten cents left of the two dollars he had reserved, and this coin he put into a small leather purse, which he usually carried. [Pg 79] \"If Mr. Brandon searches for money, he will be disappointed,\" he said to himself, with a quiet smile. \"He won\u0027t find enough to pay him for his trouble.\" Grit was not anxious enough about his money to keep awake. When, therefore, his stepfather entered his chamber, he was fast asleep. Brandon listened for a moment to the deep breathing of the boy, and felt that there was no need of caution. He therefore boldly advanced, candle in hand, to the bedside. The candle he set on the bureau, and then took up Grit\u0027s clothes, which hung over a chair, and proceeded to examine the pockets. His countenance changed as he continued the search. At last he came to the purse, but it felt empty, and he did not open it with much confidence. Thrusting in his finger, he drew out the solitary dime which it contained. \"Only ten cents!\" he exclaimed, with intense disappointment. \"It isn\u0027t worth taking. On second thoughts, I\u0027ll take it, though, for it will pay for a drink.\" He pocketed the coin, and resumed his search. [Pg 80] \"The boy must have a pocketbook somewhere,\" he muttered. \"He wouldn\u0027t carry bank-bills in a purse. Where can he keep it?\" Once more he explored the pockets of his stepson, but he met with no greater success than before. It is a curious circumstance that sometimes in profound sleep a person seems vaguely aware of the presence of an intruder, and the feeling is frequently strong enough to disturb slumber. Grit was a sound sleeper, but, however we may account for it, whether it was the instinctive feeling I have mentioned, or the glare of the candle, he woke up, and his glance rested on the kneeling figure of his stepfather rummaging his pockets. Instantly Grit realized the situation, and he felt more amused than indignant, knowing how poorly the searcher would be rewarded. Brandon\u0027s back was turned to him, and our hero felt inclined to try the effect of a practical joke. In a deep, sepulchral voice, he called out: \"What are you doing there?\" Brandon, taken by surprise, started as if he had been shot, and sprang to his feet in confusion. Turning to the bed, he saw Grit [Pg 81]surveying him calmly. Then his natural hardihood restored his self-possession. \"Where do you keep your money, you young cub?\" he demanded. \"Where do I keep it? I suspect you know well enough. Haven\u0027t you looked into my purse?\" \"Yes, and I only found ten cents.\" \"Did you take it?\" asked Grit. \"Yes.\" \"Then it\u0027s lucky I had no more in it.\" \"Where is the rest of your money?\" demanded Brandon. \"What do you mean by the rest of my money?\" \"I mean the sixty dollars you had with you to-day.\" Grit whistled. \"So you heard I had sixty dollars?\" he said. \"Yes.\" \"It is in a safe place.\" \"Ha! You own that you had so much money. You wanted to keep it from me, did you?\" demanded Brandon, with a frown. \"Yes, I did,\" admitted Grit. \"Did Phil Courtney tell you I had it?\" \"No matter how I heard. I know that you[Pg 82] are trying to conceal a large sum of money, which ought to be in my hands.\" \"Indeed! How do you make that out?\" \"I am your stepfather and natural guardian. I am the best person to take care of your money.\" \"I don\u0027t think so, and I propose to keep it myself,\" said Grit firmly. \"Do you defy me?\" demanded Brandon angrily. \"If you call my refusing to give you my own money by that name, then I do.\" \"Boy, you don\u0027t know me!\" said Brandon, in a tone intended to strike terror into the heart of his stepson. \"Hitherto you have had only your mother to look after you, and she has been foolishly indulgent. Now you have a man to deal with. Once more, will you hand me that money?\" \"I decline,\" said Grit firmly. \"Then on your head be the consequences,\" said Brandon. \"You will hear from me again, and soon.\" So saying, he stalked majestically from the chamber. \"I wonder what he means to do?\" thought Grit. But the thought did not keep him awake. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81853.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
