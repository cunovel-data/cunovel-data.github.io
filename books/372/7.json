{"id":10945,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII. GRIT ASTONISHES PHIL.","content":"Grit was not wholly without curiosity, and, as was natural, he speculated as to the amount which the wallet contained. When Mr. Jackson and Willie had left him, he took it out of his pocket and opened it. He extracted a roll of bills and counted them over. There were ten five-dollar bills, and ten dollars in notes of a smaller denomination. \"Sixty dollars!\" ejaculated Grit, with a thrill of pleasure. \"I never was so rich in all my life.\" He felt that the sum was too large for him to accept, and he was half tempted to run after Mr. Jackson and say so. But quick reflection satisfied him that the generous New Yorker wished him to retain it, and, modest though[Pg 46] he was, he was conscious that in saving the little boy\u0027s life he had placed his passenger under an obligation which a much larger sum would not have overpaid. Besides, he saw two new passengers walking toward his boat, who doubtless wished to be ferried across the river. They were Phil Courtney and Marion Clarke. \"We are just in time, Mr. Grit,\" said the young lady, smiling. \"Yes, my good fellow,\" said Phil condescendingly, \"we will employ you again.\" \"You are very kind,\" answered Grit, with a smile of amusement. \"I like to encourage you,\" continued Phil, who was not very quick to interpret the looks of others. Grit looked at Marion, and noticed that she, too, looked amused. \"Have you had any passengers since we came over?\" asked Phil, in a patronizing tone. He was quite ready to employ his old schoolmate, provided he would show proper gratitude, and be suitably impressed by his condescension. \"I have been across several times,\" answered Grit briefly. [Pg 47] \"And how much have you made now?\" asked Phil, with what he intended to pass for benevolent interest. If Phil had been his friend, Grit would not have minded telling him; but he had the pride of self-respect, and he objected to being patronized or condescended to. \"I haven\u0027t counted up,\" he answered. \"I might have brought my own boat,\" said Phil, \"but I like to encourage you.\" \"Really, Phil, you are appearing in a new character,\" said Marion. \"I never should have taken you for a philanthropist before. I thought you told your mother it would be too much bother to row over in your own boat.\" \"That was one reason,\" said Phil, looking slightly embarrassed. \"Besides, I didn\u0027t want to interfere with Grit\u0027s business. He is poor, and has to support his mother out of his earnings.\" This was in bad taste, and Grit chafed against it. \"That is true,\" he said, \"but I don\u0027t ask any sympathy. I am prosperous enough.\" \"Oh, yes; you are doing well enough for one in your position, I don\u0027t doubt. How much[Pg 48] would you give, now, to have as much money as I carry in this pocketbook?\" asked Phil boastfully. He had just passed his birthday, and had received a present of ten dollars from his father, and five dollars each from his mother and an aunt. He had spent a part of it for a hat and in other ways, but still he had seventeen dollars left. \"Perhaps I have as much money,\" answered Grit quietly. \"Oho! That\u0027s a good joke,\" said Phil. \"No joke at all,\" said Grit. \"I don\u0027t know how much money you have in your pocketbook, but I presume I can show more.\" Phil\u0027s face grew red with anger. He was one of those disagreeable boys who are purse-proud, and he was provoked at hearing such a ridiculous assertion from a poor boy who had to earn his own living. Even Marion regarded Grit with some wonder, for she happened to know how much money her cousin carried, and it seemed to her very improbable that the young boatman should have as much in his possession. \"Don\u0027t make a fool of yourself, Grit!\" said Phil sharply. [Pg 49] \"Thank you; I don\u0027t propose to.\" \"But you are doing it.\" \"How?\" \"Didn\u0027t you say you had more money than I?\" \"I think I have.\" \"Hear him talk!\" said Phil, with a glance of derision. By this time the young boatman\u0027s grit was up, if I may use the expression, and he resolved to surprise and mortify his young adversary. \"If you are not afraid to test it,\" he said, \"I will leave it to the young lady to decide. Let her count the money in your pocketbook, and I will then give her my wallet for the same purpose.\" \"Done!\" said Phil promptly. Marion, wondering a little at Grit\u0027s confidence, took her cousin\u0027s pocketbook, and counted the contents. \"Well, Marion, how much is there?\" said Phil exultingly. \"Seventeen dollars and thirty-seven cents,\" was the announcement of the fair umpire. Phil smiled triumphantly. \"You didn\u0027t think I had so much—eh, Grit?\" he said. [Pg 50] \"No, I didn\u0027t,\" Grit admitted. \"Now hand over your wallet.\" \"With pleasure, if Miss Marion will take the trouble,\" answered the young boatman, with a polite bow. When Marion opened the wallet, and saw the roll of bills, both she and Phil looked astonished. She proceeded to count the bills, however, and in a tone of serious surprise announced: \"I find sixty dollars here.\" \"That is right,\" said Grit quietly, as he received back his wallet, and thrust it into his pocket. Phil hardly knew whether he was more surprised or mortified at this unexpected result. But a thought struck him. \"Whose money is that?\" he demanded abruptly. \"It is mine.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it. You are carrying it over to some one in Chester.\" \"Perhaps I am; but, if so, that some one is my mother.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say that you have sixty dollars of your own?\" [Pg 51] \"Yes, I do. You didn\u0027t think I had so much money—eh, Phil?\" he retorted, with a smile. \"I don\u0027t believe a word of it,\" returned Phil crossly. \"It is ridiculous that a boy like you should have so much money. It can\u0027t be yours.\" \"Do you doubt it, Miss Marion?\" asked Grit, turning to the young lady. \"No; I believe that it is yours since you say so.\" \"Thank you.\" \"If it is yours, where did you get it?\" asked Phil, whose curiosity overcame his mortification sufficiently to induce him to ask the question. \"I don\u0027t feel called upon to tell you,\" answered Grit. \"Then I can guess.\" \"Very well. If you guess right, I will admit it.\" \"You found it, and won\u0027t be long before finding the owner.\" \"You are wrong. The money is mine, and was paid me in the course of business.\" Phil did not know what to say, but Marion said pleasantly: [Pg 52] \"Allow me to congratulate you, Mr. Grit, on being so well off. You are richer than either of your passengers. I never had sixty dollars of my own in my life.\" By this time they had reached the other side of the river, and the two passengers disembarked. \"Well, Phil, you came off second best,\" said his cousin. \"I can\u0027t understand how the boy came into possession of such a sum of money,\" said Phil, frowning. \"Nor I; but I am sure of one thing.\" \"What is that?\" \"That he came by it honestly.\" \"Don\u0027t be too sure of that,\" said Phil, shaking his head. \"Phil, you are too bad,\" said Marion warmly. \"You seem to have taken an unaccountable prejudice against Grit. I am sure he seems to me a very nice boy.\" \"You\u0027re welcome to the young boatman\u0027s society,\" said Phil, with a sneer. \"You seem to be fond of low company.\" \"If you call him low company, then perhaps I am. I never met Grit before this[Pg 53] morning, but he seems a very polite, spirited boy, and it is certainly to his credit that he supports his mother.\" \"I can tell you something about him that may chill your ardor? His father is in jail.\" \"I heard that it was his stepfather.\" \"Oh, well, it doesn\u0027t matter which.\" \"In one sense, no. The boy isn\u0027t to blame for it.\" \"No, but it shows of what stock he comes.\" Meanwhile, Grit, having fastened his boat, made his way to the cottage on the bluff. He wanted to tell his mother of his good fortune. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81849.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
