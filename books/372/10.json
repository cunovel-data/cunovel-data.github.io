{"id":10948,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. BRANDON LEARNS GRIT\u0027S SECRET.","content":"\"I had no idea the boy had grown so much,\" said Brandon to himself, as he directed his course toward the tavern. \"I thought he was a little kid, but he\u0027s almost as big as I am. He\u0027s kind of obstinate, too, but he\u0027ll find out who\u0027s master before long. It\u0027s ridiculous, his expectin\u0027 to have the handlin\u0027 of all the money that comes into the house. Just as if he had any judgment—a boy of his age.\" The chances are that Grit\u0027s judgment in the matter would have proved better than Brandon\u0027s, since the latter proposed to spend a large portion of the money for drink. \"I expect the boy makes a good thing out of his boating,\" resumed Mr. Brandon. \"He owned up that he had almost two dollars, and it\u0027s likely he earned it all to-day.\" Presently Brandon reached the tavern, and entered the barroom. [Pg 71] He called for whisky, and swallowed it with gusto. \"You may charge it to me,\" said he carelessly; \"I\u0027ll pay once a week.\" \"We don\u0027t care to do business that way,\" said the barkeeper. \"You ain\u0027t afraid I won\u0027t pay you?\" said Brandon, in a tone of affected indignation. \"I don\u0027t know whether you would or not, but our terms are cash.\" \"Oh, well, if you\u0027re so strict as that, take it out of this quarter,\" said Brandon, throwing his sole remaining coin on the counter. Fifteen cents were returned to him, and in half an hour that sum was also expended at the bar. It might have been supposed that Brandon would be satisfied, but he was not. He made an attempt to obtain another drink on credit, but the barkeeper proved obdurate. Then he engaged in a game of cards, and about half-past nine set out to go home, in a better condition than if he had had more money to spend. \"This will never do!\" he muttered, in a discontented tone; \"I can\u0027t be kept so short as[Pg 72] this. It is humiliating to think of me, a grown man, going round without a cent in my pocket, while my stepson is reveling in money. I won\u0027t have it, and I\u0027ll let him understand it.\" A few feet in front of Brandon two boys were walking. One of them was Phil Courtney, and the other Dick Graham, a poor boy, who, by proper subserviency, had earned a position as chief favorite with his companion. Brandon could not help hearing their conversation. He heard Grit\u0027s name mentioned, and this made him listen attentively. \"I can\u0027t understand where Grit got his money,\" Phil was saying. \"How much did you say he had?\" inquired Dick. \"Sixty dollars!\" \"Whew!\" Brandon felt like saying \"Whew!\" too, for his amazement was great, but he wanted to hear more, and remained silent. \"Are you sure there were sixty dollars?\" \"Yes; my cousin Marion counted it.\" \"How did Grit happen to show his money?\" \"He was boasting that he had more money than I, and I challenged him to show his money.\" [Pg 73] \"I suppose he did show more?\" \"Yes, I had only seventeen dollars. But what I can\u0027t understand is, where did a common boatman pick up so much money?\" \"Perhaps he has been saving for a long time.\" \"Perhaps so, but I don\u0027t believe he could save so much,\" answered Phil. \"Perhaps he stole it.\" Phil didn\u0027t believe this, but he would like to have believed it true. \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder if he did, though I don\u0027t know where he could get the chance.\" \"I wonder if he\u0027d lend me five dollars,\" thought Dick Graham, though he did not care to let Phil know his thought. He resolved to be more attentive to Grit, in the hope of pecuniary favors. Meanwhile, he did not forget that Phil also was well provided. \"You were pretty well fixed, too,\" he said. \"I wonder how I\u0027d feel if I had seventeen dollars.\" \"What do I care about seventeen dollars?\" said Phil discontentedly, \"when a boy like Grit Morris can show more than three times as much.\" [Pg 74] \"Oh, well, he\u0027ll have to spend it. He won\u0027t keep it long. By the way, Phil, will you do me a favor?\" \"What is it?\" asked Phil cautiously. \"Won\u0027t you lend me two dollars? I want it the worst way. I haven\u0027t got a cent to my name.\" \"I can\u0027t spare it,\" said Phil curtly. \"It will leave you fifteen——\" \"I\u0027m going to use it all. Besides, it would be the same as giving it——\" \"No, I\u0027d pay you back in a week or two.\" \"You\u0027ve been owing me fifty cents for three months. If you\u0027d paid that up punctually, perhaps I would have lent you. You\u0027d better go to Grit.\" \"He isn\u0027t my friend, and I thought you might not like my going to him.\" \"Oh, you can borrow as much as you like of him—the more, the better!\" returned Phil, with a laugh. \"I\u0027ll try it, then. I shall have to pretend to be his friend.\" \"All right. The faster he gets rid of his money, the better it will suit me.\" Brandon heard no more of the conversation,[Pg 75] for the boys turned down a side street. But he had heard enough to surprise him. \"Grit got sixty dollars!\" he repeated to himself. \"Why, the artful young villain! Who\u0027d have thought it? And he coolly refuses to let his father have a cent. He\u0027s actually rolling in riches, while I haven\u0027t got a penny in my purse. And his mother aids and abets him in it, I\u0027ll be bound. It\u0027s the blackest ingratitude I ever heard of.\" What Grit had to be grateful to him for Mr. Brandon might have found it difficult to instance, but he actually managed to work himself into a fit of indignation because Grit declined to commit his money to his custody. Brandon felt very much like a man who has suddenly been informed that a pot of gold was concealed in his back yard. Actually, a member of his family possessed the handsome sum of sixty dollars. How was he to get it into his own hands? That was easier to ask than to answer. As he had said, Grit was a stout, strong boy, nearly his equal in size and strength, and he had already had sufficient acquaintance with his firmness, or obstinacy, as he preferred to[Pg 76] call it, to make sure that the boy would not give up the money without a struggle. If now he could get hold of the money by stratagem, it would be easier, and make less disturbance. Where did Grit keep the money? \"He may have given it to his mother,\" thought Brandon. \"If so, I can find it in one of her bureau drawers. She always used to keep money there. But it is more likely that the boy keeps it in his own pocket. I know what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll get up in the night, when he and his mother are asleep, and search his pockets. Gad, how astonished he\u0027ll look in the morning when he searches for it, and finds it missing!\" Brandon was very much amused by this thought, and he laughed aloud. \"Sixty dollars\u0027ll set me on my feet again,\" he reflected. \"Let me see. I\u0027ll go to Boston, and look round, and see if I can\u0027t pick up a job of some kind. There isn\u0027t anything to do here in this beastly hole. By the way, I wonder where the boy did get so much money. He must find boatin\u0027 more profitable than I had any idea of.\" At this point Brandon entered the little path that led to his wife\u0027s cottage. [Pg 77] \"Mrs. B. is sittin\u0027 up,\" he said, as he saw through the window the figure of his wife in a rocking-chair, apparently occupied with some kind of work. \"I\u0027ll get her off to bed soon, so that I can have a clear field.\" Mrs. Brandon looked up when her husband entered, and noticed, with a feeling of relief, that he was sober. That, however, was not owing to any intentional moderation on his part, but to his lack of funds. \"Sittin\u0027 up for me, Mrs. B.?\" asked Brandon. \"I generally sit up till past this hour,\" she answered. \"I feel rather tired myself,\" said Brandon, succeeding in yawning. \"It isn\u0027t on account of having done any work,\" thought his wife. \"I\u0027ve been walkin\u0027 round considerably, and got tired.\" \"Do you come from the tavern?\" asked Mrs. Brandon coldly. \"Yes, Mrs. B., I expected to meet a gentleman there on business, but he disappointed me. Where\u0027s Grit?\" \"He has gone to bed. He has got to get up[Pg 78] early in the morning, to help me, and then he spends the day in ferrying passengers across the river.\" \"That\u0027s a bright idea of Grit\u0027s. I approve it. He makes considerable money, doesn\u0027t he?\" \"Considerable for a boy. I don\u0027t know what I should do if it were not for Grit.\" \"Just so. But now I\u0027m home, and shall soon get into business. Then you won\u0027t need to depend on him. Of course, I shall need a little money to start with.\" Mrs. Brandon did not reply to this obvious hint. She prepared for bed. An hour later, Brandon, having ascertained that his wife was asleep, left the room cautiously, and stole into Grit\u0027s chamber. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81852.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
