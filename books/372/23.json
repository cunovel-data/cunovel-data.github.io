{"id":10961,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. GRIT GIVES IMPORTANT ADVICE.","content":"\"Let me hear your idea, Grit,\" said Mr. Graves courteously. \"I have little experience or knowledge of[Pg 168] the world,\" said Grit, \"as Mr. Courtney says, or means to say, but it occurs to me to ask whether you have full confidence in your messenger?\" \"Of course we have,\" said Mr. Courtney. \"What foolish idea have you got in your head?\" \"Tell me why this question occurs to you, Grit?\" asked the president. \"I thought it possible that this Colonel Johnson, who employs the conspirators, as you call them, may have learned from the messenger that he was to be entrusted with a valuable package of bonds.\" \"Why on earth should the messenger reveal this news to a stranger?\" demanded Mr. Courtney sharply. \"Because,\" said Grit quietly, not allowing himself to be disturbed by the sneering tone of the ex-president, \"he might be well paid for doing so.\" \"Nonsense!\" said Mr. Courtney, but the president of the bank said thoughtfully: \"There may be something in that.\" \"I am sure the messenger is faithful,\" asserted Mr. Courtney positively, but it may be remarked that his confidence sprang rather from a desire to discredit Grit\u0027s suggestion[Pg 169] than from any real belief in the integrity of the bank messenger. \"It isn\u0027t best to take this integrity for granted in a matter where a mistake would subject us to serious loss,\" observed President Graves. \"I hope he is reliable, but I do not shut my eyes to the fact that such a price as he might demand for conniving with these conspirators would be a strong temptation to a poor man like Ephraim Carver.\" \"What are you going to do about it?\" asked Courtney. \"For my part I am free to confess that I attach very little importance to the astounding discovery of this young man, who knows a good deal more, I presume, about managing a boat than managing a bank.\" \"You are right there, Mr. Courtney,\" said Grit good-naturedly. \"I don\u0027t want Mr. Graves to attach any more importance to my suggestion than he thinks it deserves.\" \"Whatever your suggestion may be worth, Grit,\" said the president of the bank, \"there can be no doubt that you have brought me news of great importance. I shall not forget the obligation the bank is under to you.\" Mr. Courtney shrugged his shoulders. \"The story looks to me very improbable,\" he said. \"If I were still president of the[Pg 170] bank, I should probably dismiss it as an idle fabrication.\" \"Then, Mr. Courtney,\" said Mr. Graves emphatically, \"permit me to say that you would be wanting in your duty to the bank and its interests.\" \"I understand the duties of a bank president at least as well as you, Mr. Graves,\" said Mr. Courtney stiffly. \"After that remark you will not be surprised if I bid you good evening.\" \"Good evening!\" said the president quietly, not attempting to call back or placate the offended director. \"Perhaps I had better go, too,\" said Grit, rising from his chair. \"No, Grit, stay a few minutes longer; I wish to inquire further into this affair.\" \"Certainly, Mr. Graves, I will stay, with pleasure.\" Mr. Courtney heard this fragment of conversation, and it led him to say with pointed sarcasm, as he stood with the knob of the door in his hand: \"Perhaps I had better resign my position, and suggest this young boatman as bank director in my place.\" \"I doubt whether Grit would consider himself competent to discharge the duties of a[Pg 171] director,\" said Mr. Graves, smiling. \"It may come in time.\" Mr. Courtney shut the door hastily, and left the room. \"Mr. Courtney is rather a peculiar man; you needn\u0027t mind him, Grit,\" said Mr. Graves, when the ruffled director was gone. \"He doesn\u0027t like me very much, nor Phil, either,\" said Grit. \"It is lucky you are president of the bank now, and not he, for there is no humbug about the news I bring you.\" \"I consider it highly important,\" said Mr. Graves, \"as I have already stated. I am a little puzzled as to what I ought to do in the matter. As you say, the messenger himself may be in the plot. By the way, what put that idea into your head?\" \"I didn\u0027t know how otherwise Colonel Johnson could have learned about the bonds being sent up to Boston.\" \"Frequently the messenger himself is ignorant of the service he is to render, but in this particular instance it happened that I told Mr. Carver that I should have occasion to send him to Boston this week, and for what purpose.\" \"I am sorry that one who is in any way connected with our family should be concerned in such a plot,\" said Grit. [Pg 172] \"Of course; that is natural. Still, you did your duty in telling me of it. Whatever consequences may follow, you have done right.\" \"I can\u0027t take much credit to myself for that,\" said Grit, \"since I don\u0027t like Mr. Brandon, and it would be a great relief both to my mother and myself if he were away.\" \"As I have already consulted you on this matter, Grit,\" said the bank president, after a pause, \"I am disposed to consult you further. Have you any advice to offer as to the best course to pursue?\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered Grit. \"As long as you don\u0027t think it presumption in me, I will tell you of a plan I thought of as I was coming here. In the first place, I would send the messenger as usual, without letting him know that he was suspected.\" \"But that would involve risks, wouldn\u0027t it Grit,\" objected Mr. Graves. \"We can\u0027t afford to lose the bonds.\" \"I did not intend that he should carry the bonds,\" continued Grit. \"I would make up a parcel, filled with old papers, of about the same size, and let him think he was carrying the bonds.\" \"So far, so good, but what of the bonds? They would still be here, when we want them delivered in Boston.\" [Pg 173] \"I have thought of that,\" said Grit promptly. \"Either a little before or a little afterward, I would send them by another messenger.\" \"Good, Grit! You\u0027re a trump!\" said the banker, his face lighting up. \"It\u0027s a capital plan. But one thing you have forgotten. We shall not in this way ascertain whether the messenger is in collusion with the conspirators—that is, not necessarily.\" \"I think you can, sir. As I understand, this is the way in which the theft will be accomplished: The conspirators will make up a bundle of the same shape as the messenger\u0027s, and slyly substitute it at some point on the route. They will not openly rob him, for there will be no chance of doing so without attracting attention.\" \"If the messenger is careful, they could not easily substitute a false for the true package.\" \"That is true, and that is the reason why I think the messenger is in league with them. If he is careless, the change can easily be made. I understand Brandon and Travers are to receive five thousand dollars each for their services, and Colonel Johnson may, perhaps, have offered the same sum to Mr. Carver.\" [Pg 174] \"It would be a great temptation to a man employed on a small salary like Carver,\" said Mr. Graves thoughtfully. \"What do you think of my plan, Mr. Graves?\" asked Grit. \"I think it a capital one. I shall adopt it in every detail. The only thing that remains is to decide whom to employ to carry the genuine package of bonds to Boston. Do you think of any one?\" Grit shook his head. \"No, sir, I don\u0027t know of any one.\" \"I do,\" said the president. \"Who is it?\" asked Grit, with considerable curiosity. \"I mean to send you!\" answered Mr. Graves. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81865.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
