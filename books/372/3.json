{"id":10941,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. THE LOST HAT.","content":"Grit complied with the request of his passenger, and rowed after Phil\u0027s hat. But there[Pg 20] was a strong current, and it was not without considerable trouble that he at last secured it. But, alas! the new hat, with its bright ribbon, was well soaked when it was fished out of the water. \"It\u0027s mean,\" ejaculated Phil, lifting it with an air of disgust. \"Just my luck.\" \"Are you so unlucky, then?\" asked his cousin Marion, with a half smile. \"I should say so. What do you call this?\" \"A wet hat.\" \"How am I ever to wear it? It will drip all over my clothes.\" \"I think you had better buy a common one in Portville, and leave this one here to dry.\" \"How am I going round Portville bareheaded?\" inquired Phil crossly. \"Shall I lend you my hat?\" asked Marion. \"Wouldn\u0027t I look like a fool, going round the streets with a girl\u0027s hat on?\" \"Well, you are the best judge of that,\" answered Marion demurely. Grit laughed, as the young lady glanced at him with a smile. \"What are you laughing at, you boatman?\" snarled Phil. [Pg 21] \"I beg your pardon,\" said Grit good-naturedly; \"I know it must be provoking to have your hat wet. Can I help you in any way? If you will give me the money, and remain in the boat, I will run up to Davis, the hatter\u0027s, and get you a new hat.\" \"How can you tell my size?\" asked Phil, making no acknowledgment for the offer. \"Then I will lend you my hat to go up yourself.\" Phil\u0027s lip curled, as if he considered that there would be contamination in such a plebeian hat. However, as Marion declared it would be the best thing to do, he suppressed his disdain, and, without a word of thanks, put Grit\u0027s hat on his head. \"Come with me, Marion,\" he said. \"No, Phil; I will remain here with Mr. ——,\" and she turned inquiringly toward the young boatman. \"Grit,\" he suggested. \"Mr. Grit,\" she said, finishing the sentence. \"Just as you like. I admire your taste,\" said Phil, with a sneer. As he walked away, Marion turned to the young boatman. [Pg 22] \"Is your name really Grit?\" she asked. \"No; people call me so.\" \"I can understand why,\" she answered with a smile. \"You look—gritty.\" \"If I do, I hope it isn\u0027t anything disagreeable,\" responded our hero. \"Oh, no,\" said Marion; \"quite the contrary. I like to see boys that won\u0027t allow themselves to be imposed upon.\" \"I don\u0027t generally allow myself to be imposed upon.\" \"What is your real name?\" \"Harry Morris.\" \"I suppose you and Phil know each other very well?\" \"We have known each other a long time, but we are not very intimate friends.\" \"I don\u0027t think Phil has any intimate friends,\" said Marion thoughtfully. \"He—I don\u0027t think he gets on very well with the other boys.\" \"He wants to boss them,\" said Grit bluntly. \"Yes; I expect that is it. He\u0027s my cousin, you know.\" \"Is he? I don\u0027t think you are much alike.\" \"Is that remark a compliment to me—or him?\" asked Marion, laughing. [Pg 23] \"To you, decidedly.\" \"Well, Phil can be very disagreeable when he sets out to be. I should not want to be that, you know.\" \"You couldn\u0027t,\" said Grit, with an admiring glance. \"That\u0027s a compliment,\" said Marion. \"But you\u0027re mistaken. I can be disagreeable when I set out to be. I expect Phil finds me so sometimes.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t.\" \"You know how to flatter as well as to row, Mr. Grit. It\u0027s true. I tease Phil awfully sometimes.\" By this time Phil came back with a new hat on his head, holding Grit\u0027s in the tips of his fingers, as if it would contaminate him. He pitched it into Grit\u0027s lap, saying shortly: \"There\u0027s your hat.\" \"Upon my word, Phil, you\u0027re polite,\" said his cousin. \"Can\u0027t you thank Mr. Grit?\" \"Mr. Grit!\" repeated Phil contemptuously. \"Of course I thank him.\" \"You\u0027re welcome,\" answered Grit dryly. \"Here\u0027s your fare!\" said Phil, taking out two dimes, and offering them to the young boatman. [Pg 24] \"Thank you.\" \"Phil, you ought to pay something extra for the loan of the hat,\" said Marion, \"and the delay.\" With evident reluctance Phil took a nickel from his vest pocket, and offered it to Grit. \"No, thank you!\" said Grit, drawing back, \"I wouldn\u0027t be willing to take anything for that. I\u0027ve found it very agreeable to wait,\" and he glanced significantly at Marion. \"I suppose I am to consider that another compliment,\" said the young lady, with a coquettish glance. \"What, has he been complimenting you?\" asked Phil jealously. \"Yes, and it was very agreeable, as I got no compliments from you. Good afternoon, Mr. Grit. I hope you will row us back by and by.\" \"I hope so, too,\" said the young boatman, bowing. \"Look here, Marion,\" said Phil, as they walked away, \"you take altogether too much notice of that fellow.\" \"Why do I? I am sure he is a very nice boy.\" [Pg 25] \"He is a common working boy!\" snapped Phil. \"He lives with his mother in a poor hut upon the bluff, and makes his living by boating.\" \"I am sure that is to his credit.\" \"Oh, yes, I suppose it is. So\u0027s a ditch-digger engaged in a creditable employment, but you don\u0027t treat him as an equal.\" \"I should be willing to treat Grit as an equal. He is very good-looking, don\u0027t you think so, Phil?\" \"Good-looking! So is a cow good-looking.\" \"I\u0027ve seen some cows that were very good-looking,\" answered Marion, with a mischievous smile. \"I suppose Grit and you are well acquainted.\" \"Oh, I know him to speak to him,\" returned Phil loftily. \"Of course, I couldn\u0027t be intimate with such a boy.\" \"I was thinking,\" said Marion, \"it would be nice to invite him round to the house to play croquet with us.\" \"Invite Grit Morris?\" gasped Phil. \"Yes, why not?\" \"A boy like him!\" \"Why, wouldn\u0027t he behave well?\" [Pg 26] \"Oh, I suppose he would, but he isn\u0027t in our circle.\" \"Then it\u0027s a pity he isn\u0027t. He\u0027s the most agreeable boy I have met in Chester.\" \"You say that only to provoke me.\" \"No, I don\u0027t. I mean it.\" \"I won\u0027t invite him,\" said Phil doggedly. \"I am surprised that you should think of such a thing.\" \"Propriety, Miss Marion, propriety!\" said the young lady, in a tone of mock dignity, turning up the whites of her eyes. \"That\u0027s just the way my governess used to talk. It\u0027s well I\u0027ve got so experienced a young gentleman to look after me, and see that I don\u0027t stumble into any impropriety.\" Meanwhile, Grit sat in his boat, waiting for a return passenger, and as he waited he thought of the young lady he had just ferried over. \"I can\u0027t see how such a fellow as Phil Courtney can have such a nice cousin,\" he said to himself. \"She\u0027s very pretty, too! She isn\u0027t stuck-up, like him. I hope I shall get the chance of rowing them back.\" He waited about ten minutes, when he saw a[Pg 27] gentleman and a little boy approaching the river. \"Are you the ferry-boy?\" asked the gentleman. \"Yes, sir.\" \"I heard there was a boy who would row me across. I want to go to Chester with my little boy. Can you take us over?\" \"Yes, sir; I shall be happy to do so.\" \"Are you ready to start?\" \"Yes, sir, just as soon as you get into the boat.\" \"Come, Willie,\" said the gentleman, addressing his little boy, \"won\u0027t you like to ride over in the boat?\" \"Oh, yes, papa,\" answered Willie eagerly. \"I hope you are well acquainted with rowing, and careful,\" said Mr. Jackson, for this was his name. \"I am rather timid about the water, for I can\u0027t swim.\" \"Yes, sir, I am as much at home on the water as on the land. I\u0027ve been rowing every day for the last three years.\" The gentleman and his little boy sat down, and Grit bent to his oars. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81845.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
