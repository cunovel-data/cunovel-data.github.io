{"id":10946,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. GRIT PUTS HIS MONEY AWAY.","content":"\"You seem to be in good spirits, Grit,\" said his mother, as our hero opened the outside door and entered the room where she sat sewing. \"Yes, mother, I have reason to be. Is—is Mr. Brandon home?\" \"Yes; he is up-stairs lying down,\" answered Mrs. Brandon, with a sigh. [Pg 54] Grit rose and closed the door. \"I don\u0027t want him to hear what I\u0027m going to tell you,\" he said. \"Mother, I have been very lucky to-day.\" \"I suppose Mr. Jackson was liberal.\" \"I should say he was. Guess how much money I have in this wallet, mother.\" \"Five dollars.\" \"Multiply that by twelve.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say that he gave you sixty dollars?\" inquired his mother quickly. \"Yes, I do. See here,\" and Grit displayed the roll of bills. \"You are, indeed, in luck, Grit. How much good this money will do us. But I forgot,\" she added, her expression changing to one of anxious solicitude. \"What did you forget, mother?\" \"That your father—that Mr. Brandon had returned.\" \"What difference will that make, mother? I suppose, of course, it will increase our expenses.\" \"If that were all, Grit.\" \"What is it, then, you fear, mother?\" \"That he will take this money away from you.\" [Pg 55] \"I should like to see him try it,\" exclaimed Grit, compressing his lips. \"He will try it, Grit. He said only an hour ago that you would have to account to him for your daily earnings.\" \"Doesn\u0027t he mean to do any work himself?\" \"I fear not. You know what sort of a man he is, Grit. He probably means to live on what we can earn, and spend his time and what money he can get hold of at the tavern.\" \"And he calls himself a man!\" said Grit disdainfully. \"I am afraid our quiet, happy life is at an end, Grit,\" sighed his mother. Grit did not answer for a moment, but he looked stern and determined. Finally, he answered: \"I don\u0027t want to make any disturbance, mother, or to act improperly, but I feel sure that we ought not to submit to such treatment.\" \"What can we do, Grit?\" \"If Mr. Brandon cares to stay here we will provide him a home, give him his board, but, as to supplying him with money, we ought not to do it.\" [Pg 56] \"I agree with you, Grit, but I don\u0027t see how we can help it. Mr. Brandon is a man, and you are only a boy. I don\u0027t want you to quarrel with him.\" \"I won\u0027t if I can help it. By the way, mother, I don\u0027t think it will be prudent to leave all this money in the house.\" \"What can we do with it?\" \"I will put it out of my hands. Perhaps I had better not tell you what I am going to do with it, for Mr. Brandon might ask you, and it is better that you should be able to tell him that you don\u0027t know.\" \"You are right, Grit.\" \"I will attend to that matter at once, mother. I will be back in half or three-quarters of an hour,\" and the young boatman hurried from the house. He bent his steps to the house of his particular friend, Fred Lawrence, the son of a lawyer in the village. Mr. Lawrence was rated as wealthy by the people in the village, and lived in a house quite as good as Mr. Courtney\u0027s, but his son Fred was a very different style of boy. He had no purse-pride, and it never occurred to him that Grit was unfit to[Pg 57] associate with, simply because he was poor, and had to earn a living for himself and his mother by ferrying passengers across the Kennebec. In fact, he regarded Grit as his most intimate friend, and spent as much time in his company as their differing engagements would allow. Phil Courtney, though he condescended to Grit, regarded Fred as his social equal, and wished to be intimate with him; but Fred did not fancy Phil, and the latter saw, with no little annoyance, that the young boatman\u0027s company was preferred to his. It displayed shocking bad taste on the part of Fred, but he did not venture to express himself to the lawyer\u0027s son as he would not scruple to do to the young ferryman. Naturally, when Grit felt the need of advice, he thought of his most intimate friend, and sought the lawyer\u0027s house. He met Fred on the way. \"Hello, Grit!\" said Fred cordially. \"Where are you going?\" \"I was going to your house.\" \"Then turn round, and we will go there.\" \"I can talk with you in the street. I want your advice and help.\" [Pg 58] \"My advice is probably very valuable,\" said Fred, smiling, \"considering my age and experience. However, my help you can rely upon, if I can give it.\" \"Did you hear that Mr. Brandon had got home?\" asked Grit abruptly. \"Your stepfather?\" \"Yes; I am sorry to say that there is that tie between us. I presume you know where he has spent the last five years?\" \"Yes,\" answered Fred. \"Of course, I am glad for his sake that he is free; but I am afraid he is going to give us trouble.\" \"How does he appear?\" \"I have not seen him yet.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"He only arrived to-day, and I was absent when he reached home.\" \"Does he mean to live here?\" \"I am afraid so; and, what is more, I am afraid he means that mother and I shall pay his expenses. He has already told mother that he shall require me to account to him for my daily earnings.\" \"That will be hard on you.\" [Pg 59] \"Yes; I need all I can make to pay our daily expenses, and I don\u0027t feel like letting mother suffer for the necessaries of life in order to supply Mr. Brandon with money for drink.\" \"You are right there, Grit. I sympathize with you; but how can I help it?\" \"That is what I am coming to. I want to deposit my money with you—that is, what I don\u0027t need to use.\" \"I suppose you haven\u0027t much. It might not be well to trust me too far,\" said Fred, smiling. \"I have sixty dollars here, which I would like to put in your hands—that is, all but two dollars.\" \"Sixty dollars! Where on earth did you get so much money, Grit?\" asked his friend, opening his eyes wide in astonishment. Grit told the story briefly, and received the warm congratulations of his friend. \"You deserve it all, Grit,\" he said, \"for your brave deed.\" \"Don\u0027t flatter me, Fred, or I may put on airs like Phil Courtney. But, to come back to business—will you do me this favor?\" \"Of course, I will. Father has a safe in his[Pg 60] office, and I will put the money in there. Whenever you want any of it, you have only to ask me.\" \"Thank you. That will suit me. I shan\u0027t break in upon it unless I am obliged to, as I would like to have it in reserve to fall back upon.\" \"Come and take supper with us, Grit, won\u0027t you?\" asked Fred cordially. \"Thank you, Fred; not to-night. I haven\u0027t seen Mr. Brandon yet, and I may as well get over the first interview as soon as possible. We shall have to come to an understanding, and it is better not to delay it.\" \"Good night, then; I shall see you to-morrow, for I am going to Portville, and I shall go over in your boat.\" \"Then we can have a chat together. Good night.\" Meanwhile, Mr. Brandon, having slept off his debauch, had come down-stairs. \"Where\u0027s the cub?\" he asked. \"I wish you wouldn\u0027t call him by that name,\" said his wife. \"He wouldn\u0027t like it.\" \"I shall call him what I please. Hasn\u0027t he been in?\" [Pg 61] \"Yes, Grit has been in.\" \"Grit?\" \"That\u0027s a nickname the boys have given him, and as everybody calls him so, I have got into that way.\" \"Oh, well, call him what you like. Has he been in?\" \"Yes.\" \"Where is he now?\" \"He went out for a short time. I expect him in every minute.\" \"Did he leave his day\u0027s earnings with you?\" \"No,\" answered Mrs. Brandon, with a troubled look. \"He has the best right to that himself.\" \"Has he, hey? We\u0027ll see about that. I, as his stepfather and legal guardian, shall have something to say to that.\" Mrs. Brandon was not called upon to reply, for the door opened just then, and the young boatman stood in the presence of his worthy stepfather. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81850.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
