A STORMY TIME.","content":"\"What does this mean?\" demanded Grit, in a stern voice. \"What have these men been doing?\" \"Oh, Grit, I am glad you are here!\" said his mother. \"Mr. Brandon has brought this man here against my will, and he has treated me rudely.\" Travers looked round and saw the boy. \"Hello, my young friend!\" he said. \"You didn\u0027t tell me that my friend Brandon was your stepfather.\" \"Because I was ashamed of it,\" answered Grit promptly. \"D\u0027ye hear that, Brandon?\" said Travers. \"The boy says he is ashamed of you.\" \"I\u0027ll settle with him when I feel better,\" said Brandon, who realized that he was not in a condition even to deal with a boy. \"He\u0027s a bad-mannered cub, an\u0027 deserves a floggin\u0027.\" \"You won\u0027t give it to me!\" said Grit contemptuously. \"What is the name of this man you have brought into the house?\" [Pg 128] \"He\u0027s my frien\u0027 Travers,\" answered Brandon. \"My frien\u0027 Travers is a gen\u0027l\u0027man.\" \"A gentleman isn\u0027t insolent to ladies,\" retorted Grit. \"Mr. Travers, if that is your name, my mother wishes you to leave the house.\" \"Couldn\u0027t do it,\" said Travers, leering. \"My frien\u0027 Brandon wants me to stay—don\u0027t you, Brandon?\" \"Certainly, Travers. This is my house, an\u0027 I\u0027m master of the house. Don\u0027t you mind what Mrs. B. or this cub says. Just stay where you are, and stand by me.\" \"I\u0027ll do it with pleasure,\" said Travers. \"My friend Brandon is the master of this house, and what he says I will do.\" \"Mr. Travers,\" said Grit firmly, \"you shall not stay here. This house belongs to my mother, and she wishes you to go. I suppose you can understand that?\" \"My dear boy, you may as well shut up. I shan\u0027t go.\" \"You won\u0027t!\" said Grit menacingly. \"Oh, Grit, don\u0027t get into any difficulty,\" said his mother, becoming alarmed. Travers puffed away at his pipe, surveying Grit with an insulting smile. [Pg 129] \"Listen to your mother, boy!\" he said. \"She talks sense.\" \"Mother,\" said Grit quietly, \"will you be kind enough to go up-stairs for five minutes? I will deal with these men.\" \"I will go if you think it best, Grit; but do be cautious. I am sure Mr. Travers will see the impropriety of his remaining here against my wishes.\" \"I may see it in a few days,\" said Travers insolently. \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself, ma\u0027am. The law is on my side, and I am the guest of my friend Brandon. Isn\u0027t that so, Brandon?\" \"To be sure, Travers,\" said Brandon, in a drowsy tone. \"Mr. Brandon\u0027s friends are not welcome here,\" said Grit, \"nor is he himself welcome.\" \"That\u0027s an unkind thing for your own boy to say,\" said Brandon, in a tone which he tried to make pathetic. \"Because I\u0027ve been unfortunate, my own family turn against me.\" \"If you had behaved decently, Mr. Brandon, we would have tolerated your presence,\" said Grit; \"but during the short time you have been here, you have annoyed and robbed my mother and myself, and spent the money you stole at the tavern. We have had enough of you!\" [Pg 130] \"Do you hear that, Travers?\" asked Brandon, by a ludicrous transition shedding maudlin tears. \"Do you hear that ungrateful boy?\" Meanwhile, Mrs. Brandon, in accordance with Grit\u0027s request, had left the room. Grit felt that the time had come for decisive measures. He was not a quarrelsome boy, nor was he given to fighting, but he had plenty of spirit, and he was deeply moved and provoked by the insolence of Travers. Some consideration he perhaps owed to his mother\u0027s husband; but to his disreputable companion, none whatever. \"Mr. Travers,\" he said, with cool determination, turning toward the intruder, \"did you hear me say that my mother desired you to leave the house?\" \"I don\u0027t care that for your mother!\" said Travers, snapping his fingers. \"My friend Brandon——\" He did not complete the sentence. Grit could not restrain himself when he heard this insolent defiance of his mother, and, without a moment\u0027s hesitation, he approached Travers, with one sweep of his arm dashed the pipe he was smoking into a hundred pieces, and, seizing the astonished visitor by the shoulders,[Pg 131] pushed him forcibly to the door and thrust him out. Travers was so astonished that he was quite unable to resist, nor indeed was he a match for the strong and muscular boy in his present condition. \"Well, that beats all I ever heard of!\" he muttered, as he stumbled into a sitting position on the door-step. Brandon stared at Grit and his summary proceeding in a dazed manner. \"Wha—what\u0027s all this, Grit?\" he asked, trying to rise from his chair. \"How dare you treat my friend Travers so rudely?\" Grit\u0027s blood was up. His cheeks were flushed, and his eyes sparkled with resentment. \"Mr. Brandon,\" he said, \"we have borne with you, my mother and I, but this has got to stop. When you bring one of your disreputable friends here to insult my mother, you\u0027ve got me to deal with. Don\u0027t you dare bring that man here again!\" This was, I admit, rather a singular tone for a boy of Grit\u0027s age to assume, but it must be considered what provocation he had. Circumstances had made him feel older than he really was. For nearly five years he had been his mother\u0027s adviser, protector, and dependence,[Pg 132] and he felt indignant through and through at the mean and dastardly course of his stepfather. \"Don\u0027t be sassy, Grit,\" said Brandon, slipping back into his chair. \"I\u0027m the master of this house.\" \"That is where you are mistaken, Mr. Brandon,\" said Grit. \"Perhaps you are,\" retorted Brandon, with mild sarcasm. \"This house has no master. My mother is the mistress and owner,\" said Grit. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to flog you, Grit, when I feel better.\" \"I\u0027m willing to wait,\" said Grit calmly. Here there was an interruption. The ejected guest rose from his sitting posture on the steps, and essayed to lift the latch and gain fresh admittance. He failed, for Grit, foreseeing the attempt, had bolted the door. Finding he could not open the door, Travers rattled the latch and called out: \"Open the door, Brandon, and let me in!\" \"Open the door, Grit,\" said his stepfather, not finding it convenient to rise. \"I refuse to do so, Mr. Brandon,\" said Grit, in a firm tone. [Pg 133] \"Why don\u0027t you let me in?\" was heard from the outside, as Travers rattled the latch once more. \"I\u0027ll have to open it myself,\" said Brandon, half rising and trying to steady himself. The attempt was vain, for he had already drunk more than was good for him when he met Travers, and had drunk several glasses on top of that. Instead of going to the door, he sank helpless and miserable on the floor. \"That disposes of him,\" said Grit, eying the prostrate form with a glance of disgust and contempt. \"I shall be able to manage the other one now with less trouble.\" \"Let me in, Brandon!\" repeated Travers, beginning to pound on the door. Grit went to a window on a line with the door, and, raising it, looked out at the besieging force. \"Mr. Travers,\" he said, \"you may as well go away; you won\u0027t get back into the house.\" \"My friend Brandon will let me in. You\u0027re only a boy. My friend Brandon is the master of the house. He will let me in.\" \"Your friend Brandon is lying on the floor, drunk, and doesn\u0027t hear you,\" said Grit. [Pg 134] \"Then I\u0027ll let myself in!\" said Travers, with an oath. He picked up a rock, and began to pound the door, to the imminent danger of breaking the panels. \"There\u0027s more than one way to get in. When I get in, I\u0027ll mash you!\" The time had come for decisive action. Drunk as he was, Travers would sooner or later break down the door, and then there would be trouble. Grit seized an old pistol which lay on the mantel-piece. It had long been disused, and was so rusty that it was very doubtful whether any use could have been made of it. Still it presented a formidable appearance, as the young boatman pointed it at Travers. \"Stop pounding that door, or I fire!\" Grit exclaimed, in a commanding tone. Travers turned quickly at the word, and as he saw the rusty weapon pointed at him, his small stock of courage left him, and he turned pale, for he was a coward at heart. \"For the Lord\u0027s sake, don\u0027t fire!\" he cried hastily.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81860.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
