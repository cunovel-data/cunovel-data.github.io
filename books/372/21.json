{"id":10959,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. MR. BRANDON LOSES HIS SUPPER.","content":"When Brandon and Travers had discussed the plan, and decided to accept the terms offered by Colonel Johnson, the latter, looking cautiously about, inquired: \"Where\u0027s the boy?\" \"Out with the boat, I expect,\" said Brandon. \"He\u0027s a little ruffian. I never saw such a desperate boy of his age.\" \"He managed you neatly,\" said Brandon, with a smile. \"Pooh!\" returned Travers, who did not like the allusion. \"I didn\u0027t want to hurt the boy.\" \"He didn\u0027t want to harm you,\" said Brandon, with an exasperating smile. \"I could wind him round my finger,\" said Travers disdainfully. \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m afraid of that half-grown cub, I hope.\" Grit heard this, and smiled to himself at the evident annoyance of Travers. \"As to winding me round his finger,\" thought the young boatman, \"I may have something to say about that.\" [Pg 152] Brandon did not continue his raillery, not wishing to provoke the friend who had secured him participation in so profitable a job. \"Where\u0027s the old lady?\" asked Travers, with a glance toward the staircase. \"I believe she\u0027s gone out, but I\u0027ll see.\" Brandon went to the foot of the stairs, and called: \"Mrs. B.!\" There was no response. \"Yes, she\u0027s gone, and the coast is clear. Where are you staying, Travers?\" \"I s\u0027pose I\u0027ll have to stay at the hotel, unless you can provide for me here.\" \"You\u0027d better go to the tavern, for there might be trouble about keepin\u0027 you here. Mrs. B. and the boy don\u0027t like you.\" \"I thought you were master of the house,\" said Travers, with mild sarcasm. \"So I am,\" answered Brandon, a little embarrassed, \"but I don\u0027t want to be in hot water all the time.\" \"You don\u0027t want me to stay to supper, I reckon.\" \"Well, I guess not to-night. Fact is, I don\u0027t know when we shall have supper. Mrs. B. ought to be here gettin\u0027 it ready.\" \"Come out and have a walk, Brandon. I[Pg 153] will introduce you to Colonel Johnson, and we can talk this thing over.\" \"All right. That\u0027ll take up the time till supper.\" The two men walked over to the tavern, and Colonel Johnson walked out with them. They had a conference together, but it is not necessary to give the details here. A little after six o\u0027clock Brandon directed his steps homeward. \"I\u0027ll be a little late to supper,\" he said to himself, \"but Mrs. B. will save some for me. I feel confoundedly hungry. Must be in the air. There\u0027s nothing like country air to give a man a good appetite.\" Brandon opened the door of the cottage, and went in. All was quiet and solitary, as he had left it. \"Well. I\u0027ll be blowed!\" he ejaculated. \"What does all this mean? Where\u0027s Mrs. B., and where\u0027s supper?\" He sat down, and looked about him in surprise and bewilderment. \"What has become of Mrs. B.?\" he thought. \"She hasn\u0027t gone and left me, just when I\u0027ve come home after an absence of five years? That boy can\u0027t have carried her off, can he?\" [Pg 154] Brandon did not have long to debate this question in his own mind, for the door opened, and Grit and his mother entered. Brandon was relieved, but he could not forbear expressing his vexation. \"Well, Mrs. B.,\" he said, \"this I call pretty goings on. Are you aware that it is nearly seven o\u0027clock, ma\u0027am?\" \"I supposed it was,\" answered his wife quietly. \"And you\u0027ve left me to starve here, ma\u0027am! This is a strange time for supper.\" \"We\u0027ve had supper,\" answered Grit coolly. \"Had supper!\" ejaculated Brandon, looking about him. \"I don\u0027t see any signs of supper.\" \"You won\u0027t see any signs of it here,\" continued Grit. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that mother and I have engaged board at Mrs. Sprague\u0027s. We have just had supper there.\" \"You have! Well, that\u0027s a new start. It doesn\u0027t matter much, though. I\u0027ll go over and get mine.\" \"We haven\u0027t made any arrangements for you,\" said Grit. \"I shall pay for mother\u0027s board and mine. You can make any bargain you like for your board.\" [Pg 155] \"Well, if that isn\u0027t the meanest treatment I ever received!\" exclaimed Brandon, in wrath and disgust. \"You actually begrudge me the little I eat, and turn me adrift in the cold world!\" \"That\u0027s one way of looking at it, Mr. Brandon,\" said Grit. \"Here\u0027s the other: You are a strong man, in good health, and able to work. Most men in your position expect to support a family, but you come to live upon my earnings, and expect me not only to provide you with board, but with money for the purpose of drink. That isn\u0027t all! You bring home one of your disreputable companions, and expect us to provide for him, too. Now, I am willing to work for mother, and consider it a privilege to do so, but I can\u0027t do any more. If you don\u0027t choose to contribute to the support of the family, you must at least take care of yourself. I am not going to do it.\" \"How hard and unfeeling you are, Grit!\" said Brandon, in the tone of a martyr. \"After all I have suffered in the last five years you treat me like this.\" \"As to the last five years, Mr. Brandon,\" said Grit, \"I should think you would hardly care to refer to them. It was certainly your own fault that you were not as free as I am.\" [Pg 156] \"I was a victim of circumstances,\" whined Brandon. \"We won\u0027t discuss that,\" said Grit. \"You had a fair trial, and were sentenced to five years\u0027 imprisonment. About the unkindness. I should like to know what you think of a man who deliberately takes away the means of earning a living from his stepson, who is filling his place, and supporting his family, in order to gratify his miserable love of drink.\" \"You drove me to it, Grit.\" \"How did I drive you to it?\" \"You would not give me from your overflowing hoards, when I felt sick and in need of a mild stimulus. You had sixty dollars, and would not spare me one.\" \"So you sold my boat for half price, and squandered nearly the whole proceeds in one forenoon!\" exclaimed Grit scornfully. \"Mr. Brandon, your reasoning is altogether too thin. We have decided to leave you to support yourself as you can.\" Here the glowing prospects offered by the plan suggested by Colonel Johnson occurred to Brandon, and his tone changed. \"You may find you have made a mistake, Grit, you and Mrs. B.,\" said Brandon [Pg 157]pompously. \"You have snubbed and illtreated me because you looked upon me as a poor, destitute, friendless man. It\u0027s the way of the world! But you may regret it, and that very soon. What will you say when I tell you that I have a chance to earn five thousand dollars in the next five days, eh?\" Mrs. Brandon looked surprised, for Grit had not thought it wise to confide to his mother what he had heard of the conversation between Travers and his stepfather. Grit, on the other hand, was immediately interested, for the compensation offered was one of the things he had not overheard. \"Five thousand dollars!\" he repeated, appearing to be surprised. \"Yes, five thousand dollars!\" repeated Brandon complacently. \"That\u0027s a thousand dollars a day! Perhaps you won\u0027t be so anxious to get rid of me when I am worth my thousands.\" \"That\u0027s pretty good pay,\" said Grit quietly. \"What have you got to do?\" \"That would be telling,\" said Brandon cunningly. \"It\u0027s a joint speculation of my friend Travers and myself—my friend Travers, whom you treated so badly. It\u0027s he that\u0027s brought me this fine offer, and you insult and order[Pg 158] him out of the house. You were just as bad as Grit, Mrs. B.\" \"You are welcome to all you make, Mr. Brandon,\" said Grit. \"Neither my mother nor myself will ask a penny of the handsome sum you expect to make. You can spend it all on yourself if you like. All we ask is, that you will take care of yourself, and leave us alone.\" \"I mean to do so,\" said Brandon independently, \"but, as I shan\u0027t get the money for three or four days, I should like to borrow five dollars, and I\u0027ll repay you double within a week.\" \"That\u0027s a very generous offer,\" said Grit, \"but I don\u0027t lend without better security.\" \"Isn\u0027t there anything to eat in the house, Mrs. B.?\" asked Brandon, changing the subject. \"I\u0027m famished.\" \"You will find some cold meat, and bread, and butter in the pantry.\" Brandon went to the pantry, and satisfied his appetite as well as he could. He then went out, and Grit soon followed. \"Mother,\" he said, \"I have an important call to make, but will be back soon.\" It will be remembered that Mr. Courtney had formerly been president of the bank, but proving unpopular in consequence of his [Pg 159]disposition to manage it in his own interest, Mr. Philo Graves, a manufacturer, was put in his place. To the house of Mr. Graves Grit directed his steps. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2972/81863.html","bookId":372,"book":{"id":372,"title":"Grit or The Young Boatman of Pine Point","description":"简介： The speaker was a sturdy, thick-set boy of fifteen, rather short for his age, but strongly made.
