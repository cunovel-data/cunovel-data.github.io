{"id":97241,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"And this would only add to a long list of challenges. With a final target class four times larger than the SPARTAN-IIs\u0027, a severely truncated training schedule, and the need for these Spartans in the war increasing every month, Kurt, in fact, expected a disaster. The Pelican jet transports swooped down on final approach and angled their thrusters. The sod on the parade field rippled like velvet. One by one they gingerly touched down. Although Kurt\u0027s MJOLNIR armor was not designed to bear rank insignia, he nonetheless felt the weight of his new lieutenant\u0027s bars. They pressed down on him as if they were a ton each, as if the weight of the entire war and future of humanity rested squarely upon his shoulders. \"Sir?\" a voice whispered into his COM. The voice belonged to the artificial intelligence Eternal Spring. It was officially assigned to the planetary survey team stationed in the northern section of this peninsula. Kurt wasn\u0027t sure why Colonel Ackerson had insisted that Camp Currahee be built next to the facility. He was sure, however, there had been a reason. \"Go ahead. Spring.\" \"Updated details on the candidates available,\" it said. \"Thanks.\" \"Thank me after your so-called test, sir.\" Eternal Spring terminated transmission with a hiss of static that sounded like angry bees. Cajoled by Section Three brass, Eternal Spring had agreed to devote 9 percent of its runtime to the SPARTAN-III project. The AI was of the \"smart\" variety, which meant there were no limits on its knowledge capacity or creativity. Despite its occasional theatrics, Kurt was happy for its help. Kurt blinked and accessed the candidates\u0027 data on his heads-up display. Each name had a serial number and linked to background files. There were 497 of them, a collection of four-, five-, and six-year-old children that he somehow had to forge into a fighting force unparalleled in the history of warfare. The hatch on the nearest Pelican opened with a hiss, and a tall man strode out. Mendez had aged well. His trim body looked chiseled from ironwood, but the hair was now silver, and there were deep creases around his eyes and a set of ragged scars that ran brow to chin. \"Chief.\" Kurt resisted the urge to snap to attention as Mendez saluted. As odd as it felt, Kurt was now his commanding officer. Kurt returned his salute. \"Senior Chief Petty Officer Mendez reporting for duty, sir.\" After the SPARTAN-II program, Chief Mendez had, at his request, been reassigned to active duty. He\u0027d fought the Covenant on five worlds, and been awarded two purple hearts. \"You were briefed on the flight?\" \"Completely,\" Mendez said. As he looked Kurt over in his MjOLNIR armor, emotions played over his face; awe, approval, and resolve. \"We\u0027ll get these new recruits trained, sir.\" This was precisely the response Kurt had hoped for. Mendez was a legend among the Spartans. He had tricked, trapped, and tortured them as children. They all hated, and then learned to admire the man. He had taught them how to fight—and how to win. \"Do they let Spartans drink now?\" Mendez asked. \"Chief?\" \"A bad joke, sir. We might both need one before this day is over,\" he said. \"The new trainees are, well, sir, a little wild. I don\u0027t know if either of us is ready for this.\" Mendez turned to the Pelicans, inhaled, and yelled, \"Recruits, fallout!\" Kids streamed off dropship ramps. Hundreds tromped onto the field, screaming, and throwing clumps of sod at one another. After being cooped up for hours, they went wild. A few, however, milled near the ships, dark circles under their eyes, and they huddled tighter. Adult handlers herded them onto the grass. \"You\u0027ve read Lord of the Flies, sir?\" Mendez muttered. \"I have,\" Kurt replied. \"But your analogy will not hold. These children will have guidance. They will have disciphne. And they have one thing no ordinary children have, not even the SPARTAN-II candidates. Motivation.\" Kurt linked to the camp\u0027s PA. He cleared his throat and the sound rumbled over the field like thunder. Nearly five hundred crazed children stopped in their tracks, fell silent, and turned amazed at the giant in the shining emerald armor \"Attention, recruits,\" Kurt said and stood akimbo. \"1 am Lieutenant Ambrose. You have all endured great hardships to be here. 1 know each of you has lost your loved ones on Jericho VII, Harvest, and Biko. The Covenant has made orphans of you all.\" Every kid stared at him, some with tears now gleaming in their eyes, others with pure burning hatred. \"1 am going to give you a chance to learn how to fight, a chance to become the best soldiers the UNSC has ever produced, a chance to destroy the Covenant. I am giving you a chance to be like me: a Spartan.\" The kids crowded before him, close… but none actually dared to touch the shimmering pale green armor. \"We cannot accept everyone, though,\" Kurt continued. \"There are five hundred of you. We have three hundred training slots. So tonight. Senior Chief Petty Officer Mendez\"—he nodded to the Chief—\"has devised a way to separate those who truly want this opportunity from those who do not.\" Kurt handed him a tablet reader. \"Chief?\" To his credit Mendez registered shock for only a split second. He scanned the tablet, frowned, but nodded. \"Yes, sir,\" he whispered. Mendez yelled at the children, \"You want to be Spartans? Then get back on those ships.\" They stood shocked, staring at him. \"No? I guess we found a few washouts. You.\" He pointed to one child at random. \"You. And you.\" The chosen kids looked at each other, at the ground, and then shook their heads. \"No?\" Mendez said. \"Then get on those Pelicans.\" They did so, and so did the others, a slow shuffling procession. \"Drill instructors,\" Mendez said. Three dozen NCOs snapped to attention. \"You will find Falcon Wing aerial descent units on the field. Load them ASAP and make sure your trainees are properly fit-led. Their safe deployment is now your responsibility.\" The DIs nodded and ran toward the bundled Falcon Wing backpacks. The Chief turned back to Kurt. \"You\u0027re going to make them drop?\" He raised both eyebrows in surprise. \"At night?\" \"The Falcons are the safest drop units,\" Kurt replied. \"With respect, sir, some of them are only four years old.\" \"Motivation, Chief. If they can do this, they\u0027ll be ready for what we have to put them through.\" Kurt watched the Pelicans fire their jets and scorch the grass. \"But just in case,\" he added, \"deploy all dropships to recover the candidates. There may be accidents.\" Mendez exhaled deeply. \"Yes, sir\" He started for the nearest Pelican. \"Chief,\" Kurt said, \"I\u0027m sorry that order had to come from you.\" \"I understand, sir,\" Mendez replied. \"You\u0027re their CO. You have to inspire and command their respect. I\u0027m their drill instructor. I get to be their worst nightmare.\" He gave Kurt a crooked smile and climbed aboard. Shane clung to the plastic loops on the side of the Pelican\u0027s hull. He stood shoulder to shoulder with the other kids—packed so close that he wouldn\u0027t have fallen if he let go. The roar of the Pelican\u0027s jets was deafening, but still he could hear his own heart racing in his chest. This was the end of a journey that had started years ago. He\u0027d heard jets like this when it started, the jets of the light freighter as it rocketed away from Harvest. It had been crowded on that ship, too… filled with refugees trying to get as far away, as fast as they could, from the monsters. Only one in six ships had made it. Sometimes Shane wished he hadn\u0027t lived and seen the monsters burn his family and home. When the Navy man had come to visit him in the orphanage and asked if Shane wanted to get even with them, he immediately volunteered. No matter what it took, he was going to kill all the Covenant. They had given him lots of tests, the written kind, blood tests, and then a month-long space trip as the Navy man collected more and more volunteers. Shane had thought the testing was over when they final got into the PeHcans and came to this new place, but he\u0027d barely touched the ground when they\u0027d been shoved back inside and sent back up into the air. He\u0027d gotten a glimpse of the one in charge. He wore armor like Shane had seen in fairy tale books: the Green Knight who fought dragons. That\u0027s what Shane wanted. He was going to wear armor like that one day and kill all the monsters. \"Check your straps,\" an old Navy man barked at him and the other kids. Shane tugged at the black backpack that they\u0027d put on him three minutes ago. It weighed almost as much as him, and the straps had been pulled so tight they cut into his ribs. \"Report any looseness,\" the man shouted over the roar of the engines. None of the twenty other kids said anything. \"Recruits, stand by,\" the man barked. He listened into his headphones and then a green light blinked on a panel near his head. The man punched numbers into a keypad. The back of the Pelican hissed open, the ramp lowered, and a tornado screamed around Shane. He yelled; so did the other kids. They all pushed and shoved to the front of the Pelican\u0027s bay. The old Navy man stood by the open bay door, unafraid that only a meter to his rear was open sky. He regarded the squirming kids with disgust. Behind him a dusky orange band marked the edge of the world. Twilight and lengthening shadows slipped over snowcapped mountains. \"You will form a line and jump,\" the man shouted. \"You will count to ten and pull this.\" He reached up to his left shoulder, grasped the bright red handle there, and made a pretend pull motion. \"Some confusion will be normal.\" The kids stared at him. No one moved. \"If you cannot do this,\" the man said, \"you cannot be a Spar-Ian. It\u0027s your choice.\" Shane looked at the other kids. They looked at him. A girl with pigtails and missing her front teeth stepped forward. \"I\u0027ll go first, sir,\" she yelled. \"Good girl,\" he said. \"Go right to the edge; hang on to the guide line.\" She took the tiniest baby steps to the edge of the Pelican, then froze. She took three deep breaths and then with a squeak, she jumped. The wind caught her. She vanished into the dark. \"Next!\" the old Navy man said. All the kids, Shane included, slowly formed a line. He couldn\u0027t believe they were doing this. It was nuts. The next boy got to the edge, looked down, and screamed. He fell backward, and scrambled away. \"No!\" he said. \"No way!\" \"Next!\" the man called, and didn\u0027t give the kid cowering on the deck another glance. The next boy jumped without even looking. And the next. Then it was Shane\u0027s turn. He couldn\u0027t move his legs. \"Hurry up, loser,\" the boy behind him said and gave him a shove. Shane stumbled forward—halting only a half step from the edge. He turned and stopped himself from shoving this kid back. The kid was a head taller than Shane, and his black hair fell into his eyes, making it seem like he was missing his forehead. Shane wasn\u0027t afraid of this creep. He turned back to face the night rushing past him. This was what he was afraid of. Shane\u0027s legs filled with freezing concrete. The rushing wind was so loud he couldn\u0027t hear anything else anymore, not even his hammering heart. He couldn\u0027t move. He was stuck on the edge. There was no way he could jump. But now he was so scared he couldn\u0027t even turn around and chicken out, either. If he sat down, though, and then slowly inched back— \"Go, dumbass!\" The creep kid behind him pushed. Hard. Shane fell off the ramp and into the night. He tumbled and screamed until he couldn\u0027t breathe. Shane saw flashes of the dimming sunset, black ground, the white caps of the mountains, and stars. He threw up. Some confusion will be normal. The red handle! He had to grab it. He reached up, but there was nothing there. He clawed at his shoulder until two fmgers found purchase. He tugged. There was a ripping sound and something unraveled from his pack. Shane jerked straight, his legs whipping after him, and his teeth snapped together from the sudden bone-jarring deceleration. The spinning world stopped. Gasping and blinking away his tears, Shane saw the last bit of amber light fade from the edge of the world, and the stars gently rock back and forth around him. Overhead the wind whistled and rippled though a black canopy. Ropes connected Shane to this wing, and his hands instinctively grabbed them. As he pulled, the wing turned and angled in that direction. The sudden motion made him dizzy again, so he let go. Shane squinted and made out shapes swimming around him: black on black like the bats on Harvest. Those had to be the other kids, gliding like he was. His face heated as he remembered how he\u0027d chickened out at the last minute in the Pelican… in front of everyone. Even that little girl had jumped. Shane never wanted to be scared like that again. Maybe if he imagined that he was already dead, then there would be nothing to be afraid of. It\u0027d be like he\u0027d died with his parents on Harvest. He mustered this mental image—dead and nothing to fear— and to test it, he looked down. Past his dangling feet there was a two-centimeter green square. After a moment, he realized it was the field where all the Pelicans had landed. Tiny lines snaked from the field illuminated by tiny firefly pinpoints, \"Nothing to be scared of,\" he whispered, trying to convince himself. He forced himself to pull the ropes, angle downward, and speed toward the green field. Wind whipped through the black silk wing, and tore at Shane\u0027s face. He didn\u0027t care. He wanted down fast. Maybe if he was the first one down, he\u0027d show everyone that he wasn\u0027t scared. Shane saw tiny people and scorch marks where the Pelicans had burned the grass. And no other parachutes yet. Good. He\u0027d be first, and he\u0027d land right in front of the Green Knight. Shane hit the ground. His knees pistoned into his chest and knocked the wind out of him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-7.html","bookId":1636,"book":{"id":1636,"title":"Halo: Ghosts of Onyx (Halo #4)","description":"Storyline: Halo: Ghosts of Onyx (Halo #4) Continuing the saga of the award-winning Xbox™ game!
