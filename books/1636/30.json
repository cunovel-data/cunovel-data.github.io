{"id":97263,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"During their Slipspace journey, Voro had made clear to his Ship Masters that they had to be willing to set aside their beliefs. Others had been blinded by the glory of Ring of the Gods, and subsequently destroyed by the human and the Flood infestations. They must be prepared for anything.\\n\\n \"Alert the fleet to make weapons ready,\" Voro ordered Y\u0027gar.\\n\\n \"Aye, sir.\"\\n\\n Voro wanted to believe the Forerunners had left this world to deliver them in their hour of greatest need… his instincts, however, told him not to trust anything but Sangheili blood.\\n\\n \"Far Sight Lost broadcasting on an open channel,\" Y\u0027gar said, and put it on bridge audio.\\n\\n \"… let us cast arms aside,\" Ship Master Qunu began the ritual greeting. \"… And like discard our wrath. Thou, in faith, will keep us safe. Whilst we find the path.\"\\n\\n The thousands of the tiny craft drifted in the central holographic display like a cloud of dust. They formed octahedral geometries, solidifying into crystals of gold and ruby in the dark of space, surrounding the Far Sight Lost.\\n\\n \"Incoming transmission,\" Y\u0027gar said. Both his eyes, sighted and blind, were wide with wonder. \"On the Prophets channel, sir.\"\\n\\n A flat voice, intoning perfectly the ancient dialect, rumbled over the bridge: \"Rescue phase concluded. Threat-analysis phase concluded. Reclaimant request for Shield World access… denied. Initiating outer defense program.\"\\n\\n \"Energy spikes detected,\" Y\u0027gar said. \"Frequencies shifting to resonate suites.\" He looked up. \"They\u0027re combining fire, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Fleetwide channel,\" Voro shouted. \"All Ship Masters make ready to fire. Link targeting control through the Incorruptible.\"\\n\\n Uruo monitored his console as the ships in their fleet linked into a single spiderweb network of firepower. \"Fleet fire control is now yours, sir,\" he told Voro.\\n\\n \"Target laser and energy projectors on these cluster formations,\" Voro said.\\n\\n Uruo smoothed his hands over the network, double-checking the numbers, and then said, \"Target solutions calculated, sir. On your order.\"\\n\\n A thousand tiny eyes blazed within the alien formations. Energy beams collimated into lances of golden light that painted the hull of the Far Sight Lost.\\n\\n The ship did not have its shields up. Beams sliced through armor and decks, piercing through and through, blasting cones of vaporized alloy into space.\\n\\n Voro quenched his rage and studied the carnage. Some advantage had to be gleaned from this tragedy.\\n\\n Individually the tiny craft could do no harm. Together, however, they were more than a match for the Far Sight Lost. Their octahedral structures shimmered with energy shields.\\n\\n Voro assumed their defensive strength multiplied when combined as well, \"Release weapons interlink safety locks,\" Voro ordered, and raised his hand.\\n\\n He prayed for the soul of Ship Master Qunu, who had revealed for them a new enemy.\\n\\n Penetrated by a dozen beams, the ventral decks of the Far Sight Lost exploded. The ship rolled over like a great beast in its death throes. The weapons cut through the aft section. The plasma core breached, and three plumes of blue fire erupted from the hull— heating the aft quarter of the vessel red-, yellow-, and then white-hot—before the vessel detonated.\\n\\n The crystalline geometry of the alien formations rippled and their shields flared.\\n\\n \"Now!\" Voro commanded. \"All laser and projectors fire.\"\\n\\n All ships under his command launched a barrage, and the deep night of space lit with crisscrossing lines of illumination. Hundreds of lasers painted the weakened alien shields and made them sputter with static. Ten microseconds later, energy-projector capacitors discharged and blasts of holy white radiation impacted the formations, overloaded the distressed shields, and scattered their coherence.\\n\\n Stripped of their protection, the tiny drone ships erupted into streams of superheated particles. Their central eyes blazed white-hot as if their fury alone could protect them.\\n\\n Explosions chained through the octahedral assembly.\\n\\n Lasers and projectors shut down and the space plunged again into dankness.\\n\\n Voro blinked.\\n\\n Within the holographic display the thousands of alien ships were scattered, most now cooling blobs of metal, tumbling disconnected rods and spheres. Those that had survived moved sluggishly as they attempted to realign for another attack.\\n\\n \"Eighty-three percent of the vessels destroyed,\" Y\u0027gar said.\\n\\n Over fleetwide COM Voro said, \"All ships break and attack. Annihilate the survivors with plasma charges before they regroup.\"\\n\\n The fleet accelerated to attack speed, burning all before them. The smaller alien craft were defenseless before this onslaught.\\n\\n Ship Master Qunu had been a hero. He had demonstrated for them all that the old ways of devout placation had no place in this new Age. The Sangeili would forge their own way, with their own blood, if need be.\\n\\n \"Contact the Absolution,\" Voro told Y\u0027gar. \"Have them make ready for a Slipspace transition in atmosphere. They will scout the northern polar region where these drones came from and determine if there are high-value targets our sensors have overlooked.\"\\n\\n \"Absolution hailed, sir,\" Y\u0027gar replied. \"Orders relayed.\" He paused listening, then said, \"The Absolution is yours to command, Fleet Master.\"\\n\\n Voro nodded, indicating they go.\\n\\n The space surrounding the sleek destroyer shimmered as their Slipspace capacitors discharged.\\n\\n \"Something on the planet surface, sir,\" Y\u0027gar said, and he bent closer, concentrating.\\n\\n \"Energy anomaly in the northern polar region.\"\\n\\n He waved his hand over his controls and the central viewer split, half filling with a view of the planet\u0027s ice caps, zooming closer to reveal a wind-whipped landscape of snow dunes. A kilometer off the ground, the air shimmered in the exact same pattern as the Absolution\u0027s Slipspace transition matrix.\\n\\n \"That should not be happening,\" Uruo remarked, and took a step closer to the image, intrigued. \"A Slipspace matrix only appears upon a ship\u0027s exit. The Absolution has yet to transition.\"\\n\\n \"Hail the Absolution,\" Voro said. \"Abort the jump.\"\\n\\n Y\u0027gar shook his head. \"Slipspace matrix interfering with our signal, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Move to intercept,\" Voro ordered.\\n\\n The Incorruptible tilted and accelerated toward the destroyer as it edged toward its Slipspace field.\\n\\n The view in the holographic display shifted. Above the north pole three new octahedral formations of alien ships materialized in the glow of the Slipstream exit field.\\n\\n \"They can jump?\" Voro whispered.\\n\\n That made no sense. If they had such a capacity then why hadn\u0027t they jumped into combat with the Far Sight Lost? Or for that matter jumped to avoid destruction from the rest of the battle group?\\n\\n Voro turned to Y\u0027gar, who understood Slipstream space better than any of his officers.\\n\\n \"Explain,\" he demanded.\\n\\n Y\u0027gar straightened. \"Sir, a Slipspace transition requires more power than ships that size can generate. I can only guess that they are somehow tapping into the Absolution\u0027s Slipspace field.\"\\n\\n \"Energy spikes,\" Uruo said. \"Northern polar region.\"\\n\\n The alien ships fired, hundreds of beams bounced within their linked geometry, combining and focused though their energy shields—directed into the center of the wrapping Slipspace.\\n\\n The Absolution vanished from high orbit— —reappeared in the center of the aliens\u0027 field of fire.\\n\\n The hull of the destroyer superheated to white—flash vaporized, flowering into a ball of ultraviolet fire.\\n\\n The alien vessels comprising the octahedral formations deformed from the overpressure wave. They then flew away on random trajectories from the cloud of smoke, which was all that remained of the Absolution.\\n\\n Voro watched stunned and then he regained his wits.\\n\\n \"Scan the surface of the planet,\" Voro told Y\u0027gar. \"And recheck the sensor log for anomalies just before those ships appeared.\" He opened the fleetwide channel. \"No vessels to initiate a Slipspace transition without my explicit order.\"\\n\\n His Ship Masters sent their acknowledgments, and twenty-one personal insignia lit his console.\\n\\n \"Energy signature detected,\" Y\u0027gar said. \"In our logs before the enemy ships appeared, scanners detected a burst of extremely low-frequency energy… a transmission from this location.\"\\n\\n On the central viewer a ring of mountains snapped into focus. There was motion along the rim. Voro zoomed in and saw one rod-and-sphere drone dart back into the shadows.\\n\\n Transmission? Coordinating orders perhaps? Or a central location where these drones had something worth protecting?\\n\\n \"That is our target,\" he said. Voro activated FLEETCOM. \"All ships to OVERARCH attack pattern and prepare for orbital descent. Charge lateral lines to full capacity.\"\\n\\n The Incorruptible took position on the starboard wing of the coalescing wing formation and led the battle group into the planet\u0027s atmosphere.\\n\\n Beneath them, air heated and rolled off their hulls in waves of convective fire.\\n\\n Voro watched as the clouds in the upper atmosphere parted before their combined bow wake… and lamented over the holes in their formation. Two ships lost. The fault was his. How could any continue to follow his orders after such errors?\\n\\n Yet Voro felt their confidence. Perhaps that was delusion, but they had followed him unquestioningly into battle. They knew that what happened here could determine the fate of all Sangheili. They had to succeed, even if it cost their lives.\\n\\n They swooped over the surface of the planet, over twilight-shrouded jungles, undulating plains of grass, and shadow-filled canyons. Flocks of birds and herd animals scattered before their ominous presence.\\n\\n No more alien craft rose to challenge them. Where were the hundreds they had seen at the northern pole? In reserve? Lurking in ambush?\\n\\n \"Come to dead slow,\" Voro commanded over FLEETCOM. \"Maintain battle conditions.\"\\n\\n As the fleet crossed the crater summit, a collection of drones appeared on the inner rim spewing earth and stone into the air.\\n\\n Three of his destroyers opened fire and left nothing but a surface of crackling glass.\\n\\n As the greater body of the fleet crossed into the crater, the light from their heated lateral lines illuminated the dark interior, revealing giant arches and pillars, steps that circled faceted silver domes. It was a city of magnificent proportions. The shapes were instinctively recognized by Voro from Holy Scriptures. Every line and curve, every symbol had been burned into his soul.\\n\\n This was a Forerunner city. Intact. Sacred. Untouched. It was what every member of the Covenant had dreamed of finding… if not in this life, then the next.\\n\\n Would it be so easy to claim their prize? The technological and theological treasures were close enough to touch. Voro\u0027s joints weakened and he wanted to drop and bow before the glory of it all.\\n\\n He stopped, ashamed. Such religious stupor would only blind him to the dangers.\\n\\n Voro must not bow to the Forerunner ghosts. He must be the sole authority here.\\n\\n He turned to the Lekgolo pair who ever remained at his back on the bridge.\\n\\n \"Prepare for battle,\" he told them.\\n\\n Although the Lekgolo could not smile, Voro sensed their \"faces\" flex in pleasure, a dozen eels squirmed and coiled over one another.\\n\\n They growled their assent, rose, saluted, and thundered off the bridge.\\n\\n Voro ran his hand over the command console. Ship Master Tano\u0027s blood still stained the edges, tingeing the holographic emitters blue. He lamented that his old mentor had not survived to witness this moment.\\n\\n \"Alien vessels accelerating from the surface,\" Uruo announced. \"Two dozen. Pair formation. On attack vectors.\"\\n\\n \"Destroy the craft,\" Voro said over FLEETCOM, \"and only the craft. Use lasers, pinpoint targeting.\"\\n\\n Tiny explosions lit the night as the drones were obliterated.\\n\\n He activated the SHIPCOM. \"Paruto, Waruna, during the ground assault take pains to minimize collateral damage.\"\\n\\n There was a double-growl response, and then Paruto asked, \"What target. Fleet Master?\"\\n\\n Voro surveyed the vast city. A complete search would take weeks.\\n\\n \"Pulse the Greeting of Ancients for a signal response,\" he told Y\u0027gar.\\n\\n \"Aye, Fleet Master.\" He broadcast the Covenant\u0027s universal handshake sequence, and waited then for a response.\\n\\n It was only a dream that any Forerunner were left to answer the call.\\n\\n \"Something…\" Y\u0027gar leaned closer to examine the wavering reply signal.\\n\\n Voro moved to his station.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s one of ours,\" Voro declared. \"Send it to the ship\u0027s Oracle for pattern match.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Y\u0027gar replied. \"Ship ID… DX class.\"\\n\\n \"A dropship? Identify the parent ship registry\"\\n\\n Y\u0027gar summoned the reference and his jaws dropped open in shock. \"Bloodied Spirit,\" he whispered.\\n\\n Voro narrowed his eyes at the wavering response signals. This came from the ship stolen by the human demons. They had beaten them here? Survived the Forerunners\u0027 defenses and infiltrated holy grounds? Anger boiled within him and clouded his mind, but he collected his rage… saved it.\\n\\n \"Triangulate the signal,\" he ordered.\\n\\n \"Yes, sir. There.\"\\n\\n The image shifted in the central viewer. A silver dome wavered into semisolidity. The apex of the structure faceted into seven planes, and on each, an arch opened to the interior… arches large enough for dropships to pass through.\\n\\n Voro returned to his command console. \"Paruto, Waruna, we have a target. Muster the reserves from every ship in the fleet.\"\\n\\n Paruto and Waruna replied simultaneously with a subsonic rumble of acknowledgment.\\n\\n \"You will, however, wait,\" Voro told him.\\n\\n There was silence over the COM.\\n\\n \"Wait\" was a word one dared not speak to a Lekgolo pair on the verge of battle.\\n\\n \"You shall wait for me to join you,\" Voro said. \"For I shall lead this assault.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO\\n\\n 2040 HOURS, NOVEMBER 3, 2552 (MILITARY CALENDAR) \\ SLIPSTREAM SPACE NEAR ZETA DORADUS SYSTEM \\ ABOARD UNSC PROWLER DUSK \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-30.html","bookId":1636,"book":{"id":1636,"title":"Halo: Ghosts of Onyx (Halo #4)","description":"Storyline: Halo: Ghosts of Onyx (Halo #4) \\n Continuing the saga of the award-winning Xbox™ game! \\n The Spartan-II program has gone public.
