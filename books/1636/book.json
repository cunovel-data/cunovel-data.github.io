Tales of super-soldiers fending off thousands of Covenant attacks have become the stuff of legend. \\n But just how many Spartans are left? \\n While the Master Chief defends a besieged Earth, and the myriad factions of the Covenant continue their crusade to eliminate humanity, an ultrasecret cell of the Office of Naval Intelligence known as \"Section Three\" devises a plan to buy the UNSC vital time. They\u0027re going to need hundreds of willing soldiers, though . . . and one more Spartan to get the job done. \\n The planet Onyx is virtually abandoned and the perfect place to set this new plan in motion.
