AFTER ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS OF CONTINUOUS AND RUINOUSLY EXPENSIVE RESEARCH WITHOUT A SINGLE NEW USEFUL TECHNOLOGY DISCOVERED, THE BUDGET OF THE ONYX INITIATIVE HAS BEEN REPRIORITIZED. ALTHOUGH THE ALIEN ARTIFACTS AND HIEROGLYPHICS CONTINUE TO BE OF INTEREST, RECENT REBEL ACTIVITIES IN THE OUTER COLONIES DEMAND THAT WE FACE REALITIES AND REALLOCATE OUR FINITE AI AND MILITARY PERSONNEL TO COUNTER THIS NEW THREAT.

IN THE MEANTIME, THE REST OF US HAVE A WAR TO FIGHT. /END/ Kurt never finished reading Endless Summer\u0027s flash transmission. An explosion darkened the horizon with a mushroom cloud of fire and dust, and the holographic page dissolved before Kurt could scan the rest of the files. The projector sputtered, sparked, and died. The intel Endless Summer had just sent swam through his mind. Alien ruins? Possible Covenant invasion? What did the AI mean by possible non-Covenant vectors? \"We have to get out of here,\" Kurt said. Chief Mendez continued to stare at the distant blast. \"Artillery. Maybe a missile strike?\" Kurt scrutinized the shape of the blast cloud. \"No, it\u0027s highly asymmetric. There are uneven heat blooms. I\u0027d guess a directed energy weapon.\" The Chief picked up the radio and again tried to raise the Agincourt. \"This is Camp Currahee C and C. Come in, over?\" Static. \"Try the squads,\" Kurt said. Mendez nodded. \"Saber, come in. Katana? Report, this is Chief Mendez. Gladius.\" He clicked the mic. This time, there wasn\u0027t even static, only dead air. \"You think\"—Mendez looked up at the sky—\"the Agincourt did something?\" The Chief crinkled his silver brows together, worried. It was an emotion Kurt had never before seen on the old man\u0027s features. Another detonation shook Zone 67. What had been a distant granite bluff turned into a disintegrating rain of dust. \"We\u0027ve received orders to defend Zone 67,\" Kurt said. Mendez sighed and shrugged. \"I\u0027ve got my M6 sidearm.\" He patted his holster. \"And a knife in my boot. You?\" Kurt held out his hands. \"Should be a fair fight then,\" Mendez remarked. He tried the radio again. \"Come in, Saber.\" His voice filtered through the speaker, crackling with pops and static. Kurt shook his head. \"Something\u0027s jamming the transmission. Our Spartans aren\u0027t going to fight with stun rounds and flash-bang grenades. They\u0027ll head to the armory at Camp Currahee.\" \"Tom and Lucy should already be there,\" Mendez said. He moved to the zip line that stretched from the tree house top to the jungle floor. He grabbed the line, wrapped slide casing on, and then jumped over the edge. For a man pushing sixty, the Chief moved like a soldier thirty years younger. It wasn\u0027t the first time Kurt had wondered what kind of Spartan he would have made. Kurt followed down the zip line, free-falling for a moment, then squeezing the line to brake; he landed hard. They ran for the Warthog parked on the dirt track at the base of the tree house. Kurt jumped into the driver\u0027s side, and turned the engine over. The vehicle coughed to life and purred. \"No BMP damage,\" Mendez said. \"Or the coil would have been fried.\" It was almost a disappointment. A nuke, Kurt could understand. Fissile materials were used only by the UNSC or rebels— human forces. He floored the accelerator and the Warthog fishtailed, and then the tires caught and they bumped down the dirt track. The day suddenly brightened, and an extra set of shadows crisscrossed the jungle floor. Kurt slowed the Warthog, and looked up at the sky The canopy obscured his view, so he turned off the track and drove into the jungle, bouncing over exposed roots, and then down the bank of the Twin Forks River. Here Kurt had a clear line of sight to the sky, and he noted the sun had moved to a new position lower in the sky. No, it hadn\u0027t moved. There were two suns. This new sun faded and a ring of smoke expanded around its center. This fireball seemed to pause, and then it shattered in a starburst of glittering molten metal. In high orbit, the Agincourt exploded. CHAPTER FOURTEEN 0715 HOURS, OCTOBER 31, 2552 (MILITARY CALENDAR) \\ ZETA DORADUS SYSTEM, NEAR ZONE 67, PLANET ONYX Ash ran for his life over the rocky ground. He wasn\u0027t sure how the thing was tracking him in his SPI suit, but it was. He looked over his shoulder and saw the three booms and single eye of the drone flash in the sunlight. It accelerated and skimmed over the ground in pursuit of Team Saber. \"Scatter!\" he ordered over TEAMCOM. That drone\u0027s beam weapon could melt through their armor in the blink of an eye. Ash wasn\u0027t going to take the chance of it wiping out his entire squad with a single shot. Mark and Dante broke left. Holly went right. Ash didn\u0027t see Olivia; she had to be stealthing. Ash decided to flat-out run straight ahead, hoping to draw its fire. He risked another glance back: the drone veered left after Holly. She sprinted up a slope. Ash saw this slope ended in a sheer cliff a hundred meters ahead of her. When she got there, she\u0027d be trapped. Even if she jumped, and survived, then the drone would still have her, firing from above. He wouldn\u0027t let that happen. He ran back. Holly skidded to a halt at the cliff\u0027s edge. The drone angled above her, and its central spherical eye burned red. Ash fired his MA5B assault rifle. A translucent gold energy shield shimmered around the drone, and the rubber rounds bounced off. The central eye continued to heat. He wasn\u0027t giving up that easily. Those shields weren\u0027t like Covenant shields, invisible until they interacted with projectile or energy. Ash had seen these pop into place just before his round had struck. He had to try something else. Ash picked up a rock and sidearmed it at the drone. It was nowhere near as fast as a bullet, but it was a great deal heavier. The stone hit, and spanged off one of its metal booms, scratching it. No shields this time. The drone hesitated, and one boom looked like it twitched. Ash noticed that the three booms were not connected to the center sphere. They all just floated there. What was this thing? It closed on Holly. She fired at it, but its shields snapped into place once again, deflecting the rounds. She looked over the cliff\u0027s edge and took a deep breath. She was going to jump. \"No way,\" Ash whispered. He grabbed a fist-sized chunk of onyx and hurled it with all his strength. It connected—dead center with the drone\u0027s spherical red eye. \"Yes!\" he cried. The drone rotated to face Ash. His elation instantly evaporated as the thing glided toward him, picking up speed. Ash turned and ran; he jinked right and then left. The ground exploded. Heat washed over him, and he flew head over heels. He landed flat on his back, slapping at the last moment to break the fall. Ash rolled, and with only a slight limp, he kept running. He hoped the other squads were having better luck. Olivia had picked up Katana squad\u0027s signal. They\u0027d reported they were being forced into Zone 67. They\u0027d lost their signal shortly thereafter. They\u0027d never gotten word from Gladius squad. Either they were dark or dead. He looked back: the drone was almost on top of him. Its single eye heated to a cherry- red cinder, preparing another blast of energy. Ahead there was a crevice in the rock, a sinuous two-meter channel that could have been a deep river a million years ago before this place dried up. He sprinted for it and dove. The channel was much deeper than he had imagined. He bounced off the walls and landed ten meters farther at the bottom. The shadow of the drone flashed overhead and vanished. Ash slowly got to his feet, and held his breath. Had he lost it? Maybe they had a chance after all to— The drone reappeared overhead. He could run down the channel, but with all its twists and turns, he\u0027d be slow. Besides, it didn\u0027t even have to hit him with its energy beam. One shot at the walls and he\u0027d be buried alive. Ash was trapped. So he stood absolutely still… hoping it could only detect motion. The drone dropped into the channel and stopped halfway down—staring directly at him. The eye glowed dull red, heating to molten golden. If Ash didn\u0027t know better he\u0027d say the machine looked angry. He needed to let the rest of Saber know where he was, at least know what he had discovered. Radio silence was no help now. He clicked on his COM, and turned up the gain to maximum.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-13.html","bookId":1636,"book":{"id":1636,"title":"Halo: Ghosts of Onyx (Halo #4)","description":"Storyline: Halo: Ghosts of Onyx (Halo #4) Continuing the saga of the award-winning Xbox™ game!
