{"id":109996,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"STEVE STIFFENED AS SOON as the spider bit him. His yells stopped dead in his throat, his lips turned blue, his eyes snapped wide open. For what seemed an eternity (though it couldn\u0027t have been more than three or four seconds), he tottered on his feet. Then he crumpled to the floor like a scarecrow.\\n\\n The fall saved him. As with the goat at the Cirque Du Freak show, Madam Octa\u0027s first bite knocked Steve out, but didn\u0027t kill him right away. I saw her moving along his neck before he fell, searching for the right spot, preparing for the second, killer bite.\\n\\n The fall disturbed her. She slipped from Steve\u0027s neck and it took her a few seconds to climb back up.\\n\\n Those seconds were all I needed.\\n\\n I was in a state of shock, but the sight of her emerging over his shoulder like some terrible arachnid sunrise spurred me back to life. I stooped for the flute, jammed it almost through the back of my throat, and blew the loudest note of my entire life.\\n\\n \"STOP!\" I screamed inside my head, and Madam Octa leaped about two feet into the air.\\n\\n \"Back inside the cage!\" I commanded, and she hopped down from Steve\u0027s body and sped across the floor. As soon as she passed the bars of the door, I lunged forward and slammed it shut.\\n\\n With Madam Octa taken care of, my attention turned to Steve. Annie was still screaming but I couldn\u0027t worry about her until I\u0027d seen to my poisoned friend.\\n\\n \"Steve?\" I asked, crawling close to his ear, praying for an answer. \"Are you okay? Steve?\" There was no reply. He was breathing, so I knew he was alive, but that was all. There was nothing else he could do. He couldn\u0027t talk or move his arms. He wasn\u0027t even able to blink.\\n\\n I became aware of Annie standing behind me. She\u0027d stopped screaming but I could feel her shaking.\\n\\n \"Is...is he...dead?\" she asked in a tiny voice.\\n\\n \"Of course not!\" I snapped. \"You can see him breathing, can\u0027t you? Look at his belly and chest.\"\\n\\n \"But...why can\u0027t he move?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s paralyzed,\" I told her. \"The spider injected him with poison that stops his limbs. It\u0027s like putting him to sleep, except his brain\u0027s still active and he can see and hear everything.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know if this was true. I hoped it was. If the poison had left the heart and lungs alone, it might also have skipped his brain. But if it had gotten into his skull...\\n\\n The thought was too terrible to consider.\\n\\n \"Steve, I\u0027m going to help you up,\" I said. \"I think if we move you around, the poison will wear off.\"\\n\\n I stuck my arms around Steve\u0027s waist and hauled him to his feet. He was heavy but I took no notice of the weight. I dragged him around the room, shaking his arms and legs, talking to him as I went, telling him he was going to be all right, there wasn\u0027t enough poison in one bite to kill him, he would recover.\\n\\n After ten minutes of this, there was no change and I was too tired to carry him any longer. I dropped him on the bed, then carefully arranged his body so he would be comfortable. His eyelids were open. His eyes looked weird and were scaring me, so I closed them, but then he looked like a corpse, so I opened them again.\\n\\n \"Will he be all right?\" Annie asked.\\n\\n \"Of course he will,\" I said, trying to sound positive. \"The poison will wear off after a while and he\u0027ll be fine. It\u0027s only a matter of time.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t think she believed me but she said nothing, only sat on the edge of the bed and watched Steve\u0027s face like a hawk. I began wondering why Mom hadn\u0027t been up to investigate. I crept over to the open door and listened at the top of the stairs. I could hear the washing machine rumbling in the kitchen below. That explained it: our washing machine is old and clunky. You can\u0027t hear anything over the noise it makes if you\u0027re in the kitchen and it\u0027s turned on.\\n\\n Annie was no longer on the bed when I returned. She was down on the floor, studying Madam Octa.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the spider from the freak show, isn\u0027t it?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I admitted.\\n\\n \"The poisonous one?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"How did you get it?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not important,\" I said, blushing.\\n\\n \"How did she get loose?\" Annie asked.\\n\\n \"I let her out,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You what?!\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t the first time,\" I told her. \"I\u0027ve had her for almost two weeks. I\u0027ve played with her lots of times. It\u0027s perfectly safe as long as there are no noises. If you hadn\u0027t come barging in when you did, she would have been...\"\\n\\n \"No you don\u0027t,\" she growled. \"You aren\u0027t laying the blame on me. Why didn\u0027t you tell me about her? If I\u0027d known, I wouldn\u0027t have come busting in.\"\\n\\n \"I was going to,\" I said. \"I was waiting until I was sure it was safe. Then Steve came and...\"I couldn\u0027t continue.\\n\\n I stuck the cage back in the closet, where I wouldn\u0027t have to look at Madam Octa. I joined Annie by the bed and studied Steve\u0027s motionless form. We sat silently for almost an hour, just watching.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s going to recover,\" she finally said.\\n\\n \"Give it more time,\" I pleaded.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think time will help,\" she insisted. \"If he was going to recover, he should be moving a little by now.\"\\n\\n \"What do you know about it?\" I asked roughly. \"You\u0027re a child. You know nothing!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" she agreed calmly. \"But you don\u0027t know any more about it than me, do you?\" I shook my head unhappily. \"So stop pretending you do,\" she said.\\n\\n She laid a hand on my arm and smiled bravely to show she wasn\u0027t trying to make me feel bad. \"We have to tell Mom,\" she said. \"We have to get her up here. She might know what to do.\"\\n\\n \"And if she doesn\u0027t?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Then we have to take him to a hospital,\" Annie said.\\n\\n I knew she was right. I\u0027d known it all along. I just didn\u0027t want to admit it.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s give it another fifteen minutes,\" I said. \"If he hasn\u0027t moved by then, we call her.\"\\n\\n \"Fifteen minutes?\" she asked uncertainly.\\n\\n \"Not a minute more,\" I promised.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" she agreed.\\n\\n We sat in silence again and watched our friend. I thought about Madam Octa and how I was going to explain this to Mom. To the doctors. To the police! Would they believe me when I told them Mr. Crepsley was a vampire? I doubted it. They\u0027d think I was lying. They might throw me in jail. They might say, since the spider was mine, I was to blame. They might charge me with murder and lock me away!\\n\\n I checked my watch. Three minutes to go. No change in Steve.\\n\\n \"Annie, I need to ask a favor,\" I said.\\n\\n She looked at me suspiciously. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want you to mention Madam Octa,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Are you crazy?\" she shouted. \"How else are you going to explain what happened?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I admitted. \"I\u0027ll tell them I was out of the room. The bite marks are tiny. They look like small bee stings and are going down all the time. The doctors might not even notice them.\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t do that,\" Annie said. \"They might need to examine the spider. They might...\"\\n\\n \"Annie, if Steve dies, I\u0027ll be blamed,\" I said softly. \"There are parts to this I can\u0027t tell you, that I can\u0027t tell anybody. All I can say is, if the worst happens, I\u0027ll be left holding the bag. Do you know what they do to murderers?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re too young to be tried for murder,\" she said, but sounded uncertain.\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not,\" I told her. \"I\u0027m too young to go to a real prison but they have special places for children. They\u0027d hold me in one of those until I turned eighteen and then...Please, Annie.\" I started to cry. \"I don\u0027t want to go to jail.\"\\n\\n She started crying, too. We held on to each other and sobbed like a couple of babies. \"I don\u0027t want them to take you away,\" she wept. \"I don\u0027t want to lose you.\"\\n\\n \"Then do you promise not to tell?\" I asked. \"Will you go back to your bedroom and pretend you saw and heard none of this?\"\\n\\n She nodded sadly. \"But not if I think the truth can save him,\" she added. \"If the doctors say they can\u0027t save him unless they find what bit him, I\u0027m telling. Okay?\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I agreed.\\n\\n She got to her feet and headed for the door. She stopped in the middle of the room, turned, came back, and kissed me on the forehead. \"I love you, Darren,\" she said, \"but you were a fool to bring that spider into this house, and if Steve dies, I think you are the one who should be blamed.\"\\n\\n Then she ran from the room, sobbing.\\n\\n I waited a few minutes, holding Steve\u0027s hand, begging him to recover, to show some sign of life. When my prayers weren\u0027t answered, I got to my feet, opened the window (to explain how the mystery attacker got in), took a deep breath, and then ran downstairs, screaming for my mother. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cirque-du-freak-the-saga-of-darren-shan-1/page-22.html","bookId":1570,"book":{"id":1570,"title":"Cirque du Freak (The Saga of Darren Shan #1)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #1 : Cirque du Freak \\n Cirque du Freak is the first novel in The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan.
