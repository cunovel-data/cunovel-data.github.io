I\u0027d come in near the end of English class, feeling sick. My teacher, Mr. Dalton, is great about things like that. He\u0027s smart and knows when you\u0027re faking and when you\u0027re being serious. He took one look at me when I raised my hand and said I was ill, then nodded his head and told me to go to the bathroom.\\n\\n \"Throw up whatever\u0027s making you sick, Darren,\" he said, \"then get your behind back in here.\"\\n\\n I wish every teacher was as understanding as Mr. Dalton.\\n\\n In the end, I didn\u0027t get sick, but still felt queasy, so I stayed on the toilet. I heard the bell ring for the end of class and everybody came rushing out on their lunch break. I wanted to join them but knew Mr. Dalton would be angry if he saw me in the yard so soon. He doesn\u0027t get mad if you trick him but he goes quiet and won\u0027t speak to you for a while, and that\u0027s almost worse than being shouted at.\\n\\n So, there I was, humming, watching my watch, waiting. Then I heard someone calling my name.\\n\\n \"Darren! Hey, Darren! Have you fallen in or what?\"\\n\\n I grinned. It was Steve Leopard, my best friend. Steve\u0027s real last name was Leonard, but everyone called him Steve Leopard. And not just because the names sound alike. Steve used to be what my mom calls \"a wild child.\" He raised hell wherever he went, got into fights, stole from stores. One day - he was still in a stroller - he found a sharp stick and prodded passing women with it (no prizes for guessing where he stuck it!).\\n\\n He was feared and despised everywhere he went. But not by me. I\u0027ve been his best friend since kindergarten, when we first met. My mom says I was drawn to his wildness, but I just thought he was a great guy to be with. He had a fierce temper and threw scary tantrums when he lost it, but I simply ran away when that happened and came back again once he\u0027d calmed down.\\n\\n Steve\u0027s reputation had softened over the years - his mom took him to see a lot of good counselors who taught him how to control himself but he was still a minor legend in the schoolyard and not someone you messed with, even if you were bigger and older than him.\\n\\n \"Hey, Steve,\" I called back. \"I\u0027m in here.\" I hit the door so he\u0027d know which one I was behind.\\n\\n He hurried over and I opened the door. He smiled when he saw me sitting down with my pants on. \"Did you puke?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Do you think you\u0027re gonna?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" I said. Then I leaned forward all of a sudden and made a sick noise. Bluurgh! But Steve Leopard knew me too well to be fooled.\\n\\n \"Give my boots a polish while you\u0027re down there,\" he said, and laughed when I pretended to spit on his shoes and rub them with a sheet of toilet paper.\\n\\n \"Did I miss anything in class?\" I asked, sitting up.\\n\\n \"Nah,\" he said. \"The usual crap.\"\\n\\n \"Did you do your history homework?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t have to be done until tomorrow, does it?\" he asked, getting worried. Steve\u0027s always forgetting about homework.\\n\\n \"The day after tomorrow,\" I told him.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" he said, relaxing. \"Even better. I thought...\"\\n\\n He stopped and frowned. \"Hold on,\" he said. \"Today\u0027s Thursday. The day after tomorrow would be...\"\\n\\n \"Got you!\" I yelled, punching him on the shoulder.\\n\\n \"Ow!\" he shouted. \"That hurt.\" He rubbed his arm but I could tell he wasn\u0027t really hurt. \"Are you coming out?\" he asked then.\\n\\n \"I thought I\u0027d stay in here and admire the view,\" I said, leaning back on the toilet seat.\\n\\n \"Quit joking,\" he said. \"We were down five-one when I came in. We\u0027re probably six or seven down now. We need you.\" He was talking about soccer. We play a game every lunchtime. My team normally wins but we\u0027d lost a lot of our best players. Dave Morgan broke his leg. Sam White transferred to another school when his family moved. And Danny Curtain had stopped playing soccer in order to spend lunch hanging out with Sheila Leigh, the girl he likes. Idiot!\\n\\n I\u0027m our best forward. There are better defenders and midfielders, and Tommy Jones is the best goalkeeper in the whole school. But I\u0027m the only one who can stand up front and score four or five times a day without fail.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said, standing. \"I\u0027ll save you. I\u0027ve scored a hat trick every day this week. It would be a pity to stop now.\"\\n\\n We passed the older guys smoking around the sinks as usual and hurried to my locker so I could change into my cleats. I used to have a great pair, which I won in a writing competition. But the laces snapped a few months ago and the rubber along the sides started to fall off. And then my feet grew! The pair I have now are okay, but they\u0027re not the same.\\n\\n We were down eight-three when I got on the field. It wasn\u0027t a real field, just a long stretch of grass with painted goalposts at either end. Whoever painted them was a total idiot. He put the crossbar too high at one end and too low at the other!\\n\\n \"Never fear, Hotshot Shan is here!\" I shouted as I ran onto the field. A lot of players laughed or groaned, but I could see my teammates picking up and our opponents growing worried.\\n\\n I made a great start and scored two goals inside a minute. It looked like we might come back to draw or win. But time ran out. If I\u0027d arrived earlier we\u0027d have been okay, but the bell rang just as I was hitting my stride, so we lost nine-seven.\\n\\n As we were leaving the field, Alan Morris ran toward us, panting and red-faced. They\u0027re my three best friends: Steve Leopard, Tommy Jones, and Alan Morris. We must be the weirdest four people in the whole world, because only one of us Steve has a nickname.\\n\\n \"Look what I found!\" Alan yelled, waving a soggy piece of paper around under our noses.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Tommy asked, trying to grab it.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s...\" Alan began, but stopped when Mr. Dalton shouted at us.\\n\\n \"You four! Inside!\" he roared.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re coming, Mr. Dalton!\" Steve roared back. Steve is Mr. Dalton\u0027s favorite and gets away with stuff that the rest of us couldn\u0027t do. Like when he uses swearwords sometimes in his stories. If I put in some of the words Steve has, I\u0027d have been kicked out long ago.\\n\\n But Mr. Dalton has a soft spot for Steve, because he\u0027s special. Sometimes he\u0027s brilliant in class and gets everything right, while other times he can\u0027t even spell his own name. Mr. Dalton says he\u0027s somewhat of an idiot savant, which mean he\u0027s a stupid genius!\\n\\n Anyway, even though he\u0027s Mr. Dalton\u0027s pet, not even Steve can get away with showing up late for class. So whatever Alan had, it would have to wait. We trudged back to class, sweaty and tired after the game, and began our next lesson.\\n\\n Little did I know that Alan\u0027s mysterious piece of paper was to change my life forever. For the worse! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cirque-du-freak-the-saga-of-darren-shan-1/page-2.html","bookId":1570,"book":{"id":1570,"title":"Cirque du Freak (The Saga of Darren Shan #1)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #1 : Cirque du Freak \\n Cirque du Freak is the first novel in The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan.
