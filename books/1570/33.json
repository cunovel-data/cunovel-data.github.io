It was him, sure enough, trying to look brave, but obviously terrified. \"Steve, what the...\" I began but he cut me short with a poke of the stake. \"Not a word!\" he hissed, crouching down behind the stone pillar. \"I don\u0027t want your friend overhearing.\" \"My...? Oh, you mean Mr. Crepsley,\" I said. \"Larten Crepsley, Vur Horston,\" Steve sneered. \"I don\u0027t care what you call him. He\u0027s a vampire. That\u0027s all that bothers me.\" \"What are you doing here?\" I whispered. \"Vampire hunting,\" he growled, prodding me again with the stake. \"And lookee here: seems like I found me a pair!\" \"Listen,\" I said, more annoyed than worried (if he was going to kill me, he would have done it immediately, not sat around talking first, like they do in the movies), \"if you\u0027re going to stick that thing in me, do it. If you want to talk, put it away. I\u0027m sore enough as it is without you making new holes in me.\" He stared, then pulled the stake back a few centimeters. \"Why are you here?\" I asked. \"How did you know to come?\" \"I was following you,\" he said. \"I followed you all weekend after seeing what you did to Alan. I saw Crepsley going into your house. I saw him toss you out the window.\" \"You\u0027re the one who sneaked into the living room!\" I gasped, remembering the mysterious late-night visitor. \"Yes.\" He nodded. \"The doctors were very quick to sign your death certificate. I wanted to check for myself, to see if you were still ticking.\" \"The piece of paper in my mouth?\" I asked. \"Litmus paper,\" he said. \"It changes color when you stick it on a damp surface. When you stick it on a living body. That and the marks on the fingers tipped me off.\" \"You know about the marks on the fingers?\" I asked, amazed. \"I read about it in a very old book,\" he said. \"The same one, in fact, that I found Vur Horston\u0027s portrait in. There was no mention of it anywhere else, so I thought it was just another vampire myth. But then I studied your fingers and...\" He stopped and cocked his head. I realized I could no longer hear digging sounds. For a moment there was silence. Then Mr. Crepsley\u0027s voice hissed across the graveyard. \"Darren, where are you?\" he called. \"Darren?\" Steve\u0027s face collapsed with fear. I could hear his heart beating and see the beads of sweat rolling down his cheeks. He didn\u0027t know what to do. He hadn\u0027t thought this through. \"I\u0027m fine,\" I shouted, causing Steve to jump. \"Where are you?\" Mr. Crepsley asked. \"Over here,\" I replied, standing, ignoring Steve\u0027s stake. \"My legs were weak, so I lay down for a minute.\" \"Are you all right?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m fine,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll rest a little longer, then try them again. Give me a shout when you\u0027re ready.\" I squatted back down so I was face to face with Steve. He didn\u0027t look so brave anymore. The tip of the stake was pointing down at the ground, a threat no more, and his whole body sagged miserably. I felt sorry for him. \"Why did you come here, Steve?\" I asked. \"To kill you,\" he said. \"To kill me? For heaven\u0027s sake, why?\" I asked. \"You\u0027re a vampire,\" he said. \"What other reason do I need?\" \"But you\u0027ve got nothing against vampires,\" I reminded him. \"You wanted to become one.\" \"Yes,\" he snarled. \"I wanted to, but you\u0027re the one who did. You planned this all along, didn\u0027t you? You told him I was evil. You made him reject me so that you could...\" \"You\u0027re talking nonsense.\" I sighed. \"I never wanted to become a vampire. I only agreed to join him in order to save your life. You would have died if I hadn\u0027t become his assistant.\" \"A likely story,\" he snorted. \"To think I used to believe you were my friend. Ha!\" \"I am your friend!\" I cried. \"Steve, you don\u0027t understand. I would never do anything to harm you. I hate what\u0027s happened to me. I only did it to...\" \"Spare me the sob story,\" he sniffed. \"How long were you planning this? You must have gone to him that night of the freak show. That\u0027s how you got Madam Octa, wasn\u0027t it? He gave her to you in return for your becoming his assistant.\" \"No, Steve, that\u0027s not true. You mustn\u0027t believe that.\" But he did believe it. I could see it in his eyes. Nothing I said was going to change his opinion. As far as he was concerned, I\u0027d betrayed him. I had stolen the life he felt should have been his. He would never forgive me. \"I\u0027m going now,\" he said, starting to crawl away. \"I thought I\u0027d be able to kill you tonight, but I was wrong. I\u0027m too young. I\u0027m not strong enough or brave enough. \"But heed this, Darren Shan,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll grow. I\u0027ll get older and stronger and braver. I\u0027m going to devote my entire life to developing my body and my mind, and when the day comes...when I\u0027m ready...when I\u0027m fully equipped and properly prepared... \"I\u0027m going to hunt you down and kill you\" he vowed. \"I\u0027m going to become the world\u0027s best vampire hunter and there won\u0027t be a single hole you can find that I won\u0027t be able to find, too. Not a hole or a rock or a cellar. \"I\u0027ll track you to the ends of the Earth if I have to.\" he said, his face glowing madly. \"You and your mentor. And when I find you, I\u0027ll drive steel-tipped stakes through your hearts, then chop off your heads and fill them with garlic. Then I\u0027ll burn you to ashes and scatter you across running water. I won\u0027t take any chances. I\u0027ll make sure you never come back from the grave again!\" He paused, produced a knife, and cut a small cross into the flesh of his left palm. He held it up so I could see the blood dripping from the wound. \"On this blood, I swear it!\" he declared, then turned and ran, disappearing in seconds into the shadows of the night. I could have run after him, following the trail of blood. If I\u0027d called Mr. Crepsley, we could have tracked him down and put an end to both Steve Leopard and his threats. It would have been the wise thing to do. But I didn\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t. He was my friend...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cirque-du-freak-the-saga-of-darren-shan-1/page-33.html","bookId":1570,"book":{"id":1570,"title":"Cirque du Freak (The Saga of Darren Shan #1)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #1 : Cirque du Freak Cirque du Freak is the first novel in The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan.
