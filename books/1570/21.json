Mom let him in and called me downstairs. I saw him when I was halfway down, paused, then shouted for him to come up.\\n\\n He gazed around my room as though he hadn\u0027t been there for months. \"I\u0027d almost forgotten what this place looks like,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be silly,\" I said. \"You were here a couple of weeks ago.\"\\n\\n \"It seems longer.\" He sat on the bed and turned his eyes on me. His face was serious and lonely. \"Why have you been avoiding me?\" he asked softly.\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" I pretended I didn\u0027t know what he was talking about.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been steering clear of me these past two weeks,\" he said. \"It wasn\u0027t obvious at first, but each day you\u0027ve been spending less time with me. You didn\u0027t even pick me when we were playing basketball in gym last Thursday.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not very good at basketball,\" I said. It was a lame excuse, but I couldn\u0027t think of a better one.\\n\\n \"I was confused at first,\" Steve said, \"but then I figured it out. You didn\u0027t get lost the night of the freak show, did you? You stuck around, up in the balcony probably, and saw what happened between me and Vur Horston.\"\\n\\n \"No, I didn\u0027t! \"I snapped.\\n\\n \"No?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"No,\" I lied.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t see anything?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t see me talking to Vur Horston?\"\\n\\n \"No!\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t...\"\\n\\n \"Look, Steve,\" I interrupted, \"whatever happened between you and Mr. Crepsley is your business. I wasn\u0027t there, didn\u0027t see it, don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. Now if...\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t lie to me, Darren,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not lying!\" I lied.\\n\\n \"Then how did you know I was talking about Mr. Crepsley?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Because...\" I bit my tongue.\\n\\n \"I said I was talking to Vur Horston.\" Steve smiled. \"Unless you were there, how would you know that Vur Horston and Larten Crepsley are one and the same?\"\\n\\n My shoulders sagged. I sat on the bed beside Steve. \"Okay,\" I said, \"I admit it. I was in the balcony.\"\\n\\n \"How much did you see and hear?\" Steve asked.\\n\\n \"Everything. I couldn\u0027t see what he was doing when he was sucking out your blood, or hear what he was saying. But apart from that...\"\\n\\n \"Everything,\" Steve finished with a sigh. \"That\u0027s why you\u0027ve been avoiding me: because he said I was evil.\"\\n\\n \"Partly,\" I said. \"But mostly because of what you said. Steve, you asked him to turn you into a vampire! What if he had turned you into one and you\u0027d come after me? Most vampires go after people they know first, don\u0027t they?\"\\n\\n \"In books and movies, yes,\" Steve said. \"This is different. This is real life. I wouldn\u0027t have hurt you, Darren.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" I said. \"Maybe not. The point is, I don\u0027t want to find out. I don\u0027t want to be friends with you anymore. You could be dangerous. What if you met another vampire and this one granted your wish? Or what if Mr. Crepsley was right and you\u0027re really evil and...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not evil!\" Steve shouted, and shoved me back on the bed. He leaped on my chest and stuck his fingers in my face. \"Take that back!\" he roared. \"Take that back, or so help me, I\u0027ll jerk your head off and...\"\\n\\n \"I take it back! I take it back!\" I shrieked. Steve was heavy on my chest, his face flushed and furious. I would have said anything to get him off.\\n\\n He sat perched on my chest a few seconds longer, then grunted and rolled off. I sat up, gasping, rubbing my face where he had poked it.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" Steve mumbled. \"That was over the top. But I\u0027m upset. It hurt, what Mr. Crepsley said, and you ignoring me at school. You\u0027re my best friend, Darren, the only person I can really talk to. If you break up our friendship, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do.\"\\n\\n He started to cry. I watched him for a few seconds, torn between fear and sympathy. Then my nobler self got the better of me and I put an arm around his shoulder. \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll still be your friend. C\u0027mon, Steve, quit crying, okay?\"\\n\\n He tried but it took a while for the tears to stop. \"I must look like a total fool,\" he finally sniffed.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"I\u0027m the fool. I should have stood by you. I was a coward. I never stopped to imagine what you must be going through. I was only thinking of myself and Madam...\" I made a face and stopped talking.\\n\\n Steve stared at me curiously. \"What were you going to say?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" I said. \"It was a slip of the tongue.\"\\n\\n He grunted. \"You\u0027re a bad liar, Shan. Always were. Tell me what it was you were about to let slip.\"\\n\\n I studied his face, wondering if I should tell him. I knew I shouldn\u0027t, that it could only mean trouble, but I felt sorry for him. Besides, I needed to tell someone. I wanted to show off my wonderful pet and the great tricks we could do.\\n\\n \"Can you keep a secret?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" he snorted.\\n\\n \"This is a big one. You can\u0027t tell anyone, okay? If I tell you, it has to stay between the two of us. If you ever talk...\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll talk about me and Mr. Crepsley,\" Steve said, grinning. \"You have me over a barrel. No matter what you tell me, you know I can\u0027t blab, even if I wanted to. What\u0027s the big secret?\"\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" I said. I got off the bed and opened the door to the room. \"Mom?\" I shouted.\\n\\n \"Yes?\" came her muffled reply.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m showing Steve my flute,\" I yelled. \"I\u0027m going to teach him how to play it, but only if we\u0027re not disturbed, okay?\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" she called back.\\n\\n I closed the door and smiled at Steve. He looked puzzled. \"A flute?\" he asked. \"Your big secret is a flute?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s part of it,\" I said. \"Listen, do you remember Madam Octa? Mr. Crepsley\u0027s spider?\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" he said. \"I wasn\u0027t paying much attention to her when she was on but I don\u0027t think anyone could ever forget a creature like that. Those hairy legs: brrrr!\"\\n\\n I opened the door to the closet while he was speaking and got out the cage. His eyes squinted when he saw it, then widened. \"That\u0027s not what I think it is, is it?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"That depends,\" I said, whipping off the cloth. \"If you think it\u0027s a deadly performing spider you\u0027re right!\"\\n\\n \"Oh man!\" he gasped, almost falling off the bed in shock. \"That\u0027s a...she\u0027s a...where did...Wow!\"\\n\\n I was delighted with his reaction. I stood over the cage, smiling like a proud father. Madam Octa lay on the floor, quiet as ever, paying no attention to me or Steve.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s awesome!\" Steve said, crawling closer for a better look. \"She looks just the same as the one in the circus. I can\u0027t believe you found one that looks so similar. Where\u0027d you get her? A pet shop? From a zoo?\"\\n\\n My smile slipped. \"I got her from the Cirque Du Freak, of course,\" I said uneasily.\\n\\n \"From the freak show?\" he asked, face crinkling. \"They were selling live spiders? I didn\u0027t see any. How much did she cost?\"\\n\\n I shook my head and said: \"I didn\u0027t buy her, Steve. I...Can\u0027t you guess? Don\u0027t you understand?\"\\n\\n \"Understand what?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not a similar spider,\" I said. \"That\u0027s the same one. It\u0027s Madam Octa.\"\\n\\n He stared at me, as though he hadn\u0027t heard what I\u0027d said. I was about to repeat it, but he spoke up before I could. \"The...same...one?\" he asked in a slow, trembling voice.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You mean...that\u0027s...Madam Octa? The Madam Octa?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said again, laughing at his shock.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s...Mr. Crepsley\u0027s spider?\"\\n\\n \"Steve, what\u0027s wrong? How many times do I have to say it for you to...\"\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" he snapped, shaking his head. \"If this is really Madam Octa, how did you get your hands on her? Did you find her outside? Did they sell her off?\"\\n\\n \"Nobody would sell a great spider like this,\" I said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I thought,\" Steve agreed. \"So how did...\" He left the question hanging in the air.\\n\\n \"I stole her,\" I said, puffing up proudly. \"I went back to the theater that Tuesday morning, crept in, found where she was, and snuck out with her. I left a note telling Mr. Crepsley not to come looking for her or I\u0027d report his being a vampire to the police.\"\\n\\n \"You...you...\" Steve was gasping. His face had turned white and he looked like he was about to collapse.\\n\\n \"Are you all right?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"You...imbecile!\" he roared. \"You lunatic! You moron!\"\\n\\n \"Hey!\" I shouted, upset.\\n\\n \"Idiot! Dumbo! Cretin!\" he yelled. \"Do you realize what you\u0027ve done? Do you have any idea what kind of trouble you\u0027re in?\"\\n\\n \"Huh? \"I asked, bewildered.\\n\\n \"You stole a vampire\u0027s spider!\" Steve shouted. \"You stole from a member of the undead! What do you think he\u0027s going to do when he catches up with you, Darren? Spank your bottom and scold you? Tell your parents and make them ground you? We\u0027re talking about a vampire! He\u0027ll rip out your throat and feed you to the spider! He\u0027ll tear you to pieces and...\"\\n\\n \"No, he won\u0027t,\" I said calmly.\\n\\n \"Of course he will,\" Steve replied.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said, \"he won\u0027t. Because he won\u0027t find me. I stole the spider the Tuesday before last, so he\u0027s had nearly two whole weeks to track me down, but there hasn\u0027t been a sign of him. He left with the circus and won\u0027t ever come back, not if he knows what\u0027s good for him.\"\\n\\n \"I dunno,\" Steve said. \"Vampires have long memories. He might return when you\u0027re grown up and have kids of your own.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll worry about that when and if it happens,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve gotten away with it for the time being. I wasn\u0027t sure I would I thought he\u0027d track me down and kill me but I did. So quit with the names, all right?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re something else.\" He laughed, shaking his head. \"I thought I was daring, but stealing a vampire\u0027s pet! I never would have thought you had it in you. What made you do it?\"\\n\\n \"I had to have her,\" I told him. \"I saw her onstage and knew I\u0027d do anything to get her. Then I discovered Mr. Crepsley was a vampire and realized I could blackmail him. It\u0027s wrong, I know, but he\u0027s a vampire, so it\u0027s not too bad, is it? Stealing from someone bad in a way it\u0027s a good thing, right?\"\\n\\n Steve laughed. \"I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s good or bad,\" he said. \"All I know is, if he ever comes looking for her, I wouldn\u0027t want to be in your shoes.\"\\n\\n He studied the spider again. He stuck his face up close to the cage (but not close enough for her to strike him) and watched her belly bulging in and out.\\n\\n \"Have you let her out of the cage yet?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Every day,\" I said. I picked up the flute and gave a toot. Madam Octa jumped forward a couple of centimeters. Steve yelped and fell back on his butt. I howled with laughter.\\n\\n \"You can control her?\" he gasped.\\n\\n \"I can make her do everything Mr. Crepsley did,\" I said, trying not to sound boastful. \"It\u0027s really easy. She\u0027s perfectly safe as long as you concentrate. But if you let your thoughts wander for even a second...\" I drew a finger across my throat and made a choking noise.\\n\\n \"Have you let her make a web over your lips?\" Steve asked. His eyes were shining brightly.\\n\\n \"Not yet,\" I said. \"I\u0027m worried about letting her in my mouth: the thought of her slipping down my throat terrifies me. Besides, I\u0027d need a partner to control her while she spun the web, and so far I\u0027ve been alone.\"\\n\\n \"So far.\" Steve grinned. \"But not anymore.\" He got up and clapped his hands. \"Let\u0027s do it. Teach me how to use that fancy tin whistle and let me at her. I\u0027m not afraid to let her in my mouth. C\u0027mon, let\u0027s go, let\u0027s go, let\u0027s go go go go GO!\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t ignore excitement like that. I knew it was unwise to involve Steve with the spider on such short notice I should have made sure he got to know her better but I ignored common sense and gave in to his wishes.\\n\\n I told him he couldn\u0027t play the flute, not until he\u0027d practiced, but he could play with Madam Octa while I was controlling her. I ran him through the tricks we were going to do and made sure he understood everything.\\n\\n \"Being quiet is vital,\" I said. \"Don\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n Don\u0027t even whistle loudly. Because if you disturb my attention and I lose control of her...\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, yeah,\" Steve sighed. \"I know. Don\u0027t worry. I can be quiet as a mouse when I want.\"\\n\\n When he was ready, I unlocked Madam Octa\u0027s cage and began playing. She moved forward at my order. I could hear Steve drawing in his breath, a little scared now that she was out in the open, but he gave no sign that he wanted to stop, so I went on blowing and started her off on her routine.\\n\\n I let her do a lot of stuff by herself before allowing her near Steve. We\u0027d developed a great understanding over the last week or so. The spider had grown used to my mind and the way it thought, and had learned to obey my commands almost before I finished sending them. I\u0027d learned that she could work from the shortest of instructions: I only had to use a few words to prompt her into action.\\n\\n Steve watched the show in total silence. He almost clapped a few times but caught himself before his hands could meet and produce a noise. Instead of clapping, he gave me the thumbs-up sign and mouthed the words \"great.\" \"super.\" \"awesome,\" and so on.\\n\\n When the time came for Steve to take part in the act, I gave him the nod that we had agreed upon. He gulped, took a deep breath, then nodded back. He rose to his feet and stepped forward, keeping to the side so I wouldn\u0027t lose sight of Madam Octa. Then he sank to his knees and waited.\\n\\n I played a new tune and sent a new set of orders. Madam Octa sat still, listening. When she knew what I wanted, she started creeping toward Steve. I saw him shivering and licking his lips. I was going to cancel the act and send the spider back to her cage, but then he stopped shaking and became calmer, so I continued.\\n\\n He gave a small shudder when she started crawling up the leg of his pants, but that was a natural response. I still got the shakes sometimes when I felt her hairy legs brushing against my skin.\\n\\n I made Madam Octa crawl up the back of his neck and tickle his ears with her legs. He giggled softly and the last traces of his fear vanished. I felt more confident now that he was calmer, so I moved the spider around to the front of his face, where she built small cobwebs over his eyes and slid down his nose and bounced off his lips.\\n\\n Steve was enjoying it and so was I. There were lots of new things I was able to do now that I had a partner.\\n\\n She was on his right shoulder, preparing to slide down his arm, when the door opened and Annie walked in.\\n\\n Normally Annie never enters my room before knocking. She\u0027s a great kid, not like other brats her age, and almost always knocks politely and waits for a reply. But that evening, by sheer bad luck, she happened to barge in.\\n\\n \"Hey, Darren, where\u0027s my...\" she started to say, then stopped. She saw Steve and the monstrous spider on his shoulder, its fangs glinting as though getting ready to bite, and she did the natural thing.\\n\\n She screamed.\\n\\n The sound alarmed me. My head turned, the flute slid from my lips, and my concentration snapped. My link to Madam Octa disintegrated. She shook her head, took a couple of quick steps closer to Steve\u0027s throat, then bared her fangs and appeared to grin.\\n\\n Steve roared with fear and surged to his feet. He swiped at the spider, but she ducked and his hand missed. Before he could try again, Madam Octa lowered her head, quick as a snake, and sank her poison-tipped fangs deep into his neck! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cirque-du-freak-the-saga-of-darren-shan-1/page-21.html","bookId":1570,"book":{"id":1570,"title":"Cirque du Freak (The Saga of Darren Shan #1)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #1 : Cirque du Freak \\n Cirque du Freak is the first novel in The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan.
