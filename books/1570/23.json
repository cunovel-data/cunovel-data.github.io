{"id":109997,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"THE AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS ASKED MY mother if Steve was diabetic or epileptic. She wasn\u0027t sure but didn\u0027t think so. They also asked about allergies and everything, but she explained that she wasn\u0027t his mother and didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n I thought they\u0027d take us with them in the ambulance, but they said there wasn\u0027t room. They got Steve\u0027s phone number and the name of his mom, but she wasn\u0027t home. One of the attendants asked my mother if she\u0027d follow them to the hospital, to fill out as many of the forms as she could, so they could make a start. She agreed and bundled me and Annie into the car. Dad still wasn\u0027t home, so she called him on his cell phone to explain where we\u0027d be. He said he\u0027d come right over.\\n\\n That was a miserable ride. I sat in the back, trying not to meet Annie\u0027s eye, knowing I should tell the truth, but too afraid to. What made it even worse was, I knew if I was the one lying in a coma, Steve would own up immediately.\\n\\n \"What happened in there?\" Mom asked over her shoulder. She was driving as fast as she could without breaking the speed limit, so she wasn\u0027t able to look back at me. I was glad: I don\u0027t think I could have lied straight to her face.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I said. \"We were chatting. Then I had to go to the bathroom. When I got back...\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t see anything?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"No,\" I lied, feeling my ears reddening with shame.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t understand it,\" she muttered. \"He felt so stiff and his skin was turning blue. I thought he was dead.\"\\n\\n \"I think he was bitten,\" Annie said. I almost gave her a dig in the ribs, but at the last second remembered I was depending on her to keep my secret.\\n\\n \"Bitten?\" Mom asked.\\n\\n \"There were a couple of marks on his neck,\" Annie said.\\n\\n \"I saw them,\" Mom said. \"But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it, dear.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" Annie asked. \"If a snake or a... spider got in and bit him...\" She glanced over at me and blushed a little, recalling her promise.\\n\\n \"A spider?\" Mom shook her head. \"No, dear, spiders don\u0027t go around biting people and sending them into shock, not around here.\"\\n\\n \"So what was it?\" Annie asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Mom replied. \"Maybe he ate something that didn\u0027t agree with him, or had a heart attack.\"\\n\\n \"Children don\u0027t have heart attacks,\" Annie retorted.\\n\\n \"They do,\" Mom said. \"It\u0027s rare, but it can happen. Still, the doctors will sort all that out. They know more about these things than we do.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t used to hospitals, so I spent some time looking around while Mom was filling out the forms. It was the whitest place I\u0027d ever seen: white walls, white floors, white uniforms. It wasn\u0027t very busy but there was a buzz to the place, a sound of bed springs and coughing, machines humming, doctors speaking softly.\\n\\n We didn\u0027t say much while sitting there. Mom said Steve had been admitted and was being examined but it might be a while before they discovered what was wrong. \"They sounded optimistic,\" she said.\\n\\n Annie was thirsty, so Mom sent me with her to get drinks from the machine around the corner. Annie glanced around while I was putting in the coins, to make sure nobody could overhear.\\n\\n \"How long are you going to wait?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Until I hear what they have to say,\" I told her. \"We\u0027ll let them examine him. Hopefully they\u0027ll know what sort of poison it is and be able to cure him by themselves.\"\\n\\n \"And if they can\u0027t?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Then I tell them,\" I promised.\\n\\n \"What if he dies before that?\" she asked softly.\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t,\" I said.\\n\\n \"But what if...\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t!\" I snapped. \"Don\u0027t talk like that. Don\u0027t even think like that. We have to hope for the best. We must believe he will pull through. Mom and Dad have always told us good thoughts help make sick people better, haven\u0027t they? He needs us to believe in him.\"\\n\\n \"He needs the truth more,\" she grumbled, but let the matter drop. We took the drinks back to the couch and drank in silence.\\n\\n Dad arrived not long after, still in his work clothes. He kissed Mom and Annie and squeezed my shoulder. His dirty hands left grease marks on my T-shirt, but that didn\u0027t bother me.\\n\\n \"Any news?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"None yet,\" Mom said. \"They\u0027re examining him. It could be hours before we hear anything.\"\\n\\n \"What happened to him, Angela?\" Dad asked.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know yet,\" Mom said. \"We\u0027ll have to wait and see.\"\\n\\n \"I hate waiting,\" Dad grumbled, but since he had no other choice, he had to, the same as the rest of us.\\n\\n Nothing else happened for a couple of hours, until Steve\u0027s mom arrived. Her face was white like Steve\u0027s, and her lips were pinched together. She made straight for me, grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me hard. \"What have you done to him?\" she screeched. \"Have you hurt my boy? Have you killed my Steve?\"\\n\\n \"Hey! Stop that!\" Dad gasped.\\n\\n Steve\u0027s mom ignored him. \"What have you done?\" she screamed again, and shook me even harder. I tried to say NNothing? but my teeth were clattering. \"What have you done? What have you done?\" she repeated, then suddenly stopped shaking me, let go, and collapsed to the floor, where she bawled like a baby.\\n\\n Mom got off the couch and crouched beside Mrs. Leonard. She stroked the back of her head and whispered soothing words to her, then helped her up and sat down with her. Mrs. Leonard was still crying, and was now moaning about what a bad mother she\u0027d been and how much Steve hated her.\"\\n\\n \"You two go and play somewhere else,\" Mom said to Annie and me. We started away. \"Darren,\" Mom called me back. \"Don\u0027t pay attention to what she was saying. She doesn\u0027t blame you. She\u0027s just afraid.\"\\n\\n I nodded miserably. What would Mom say if she knew Mrs. Leonard was right and I was to blame?\\n\\n Annie and me found a couple of video games to keep us busy. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d be able to play but after a few minutes I forgot about Steve and the hospital and got caught up in the games. It was nice to slip away from the worries of the real world for a while, and if I hadn\u0027t run out of quarters, I might have stayed there all night.\\n\\n When we returned to the waiting room, Mrs. Leonard had calmed down and was off with Mom, filling out forms, Annie and I sat and the waiting began all over again.\\n\\n Annie began yawning about ten o\u0027clock and that set me off, too. Mom took one look at us and ordered us home. I started to argue but she cut me short.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t do any good here,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll call as soon as I hear anything, even if it\u0027s the middle of the night, okay?\"\\n\\n I hesitated. This would be my final chance to mention the spider. I came very close to spilling the beans, but I was tired and couldn\u0027t find the words. \"Okay,\" I said glumly, then left.\\n\\n Dad drove us home. I wondered what he\u0027d do if I told him about the spider, Mr. Crepsley, and the rest. He would have punished me, I\u0027m sure, but that\u0027s not why I didn\u0027t tell him: I kept quiet because I knew he\u0027d be ashamed of the way I\u0027d lied and put my own well-being before Steve\u0027s. I was afraid he\u0027d hate me.\\n\\n Annie was asleep by the time we got home. Dad lifted her in from the backseat and took her to bed. I walked slowly up to my room and got undressed. I kept cursing myself under my breath.\\n\\n Dad looked in as I was putting my clothes away. \"Will you be okay?\" he asked. I nodded. \"Steve will recover,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sure of it. The doctors know their stuff. They\u0027ll bring him around.\"\\n\\n I nodded again, not trusting myself to answer. Dad stood in the doorway a moment longer, then sighed, left, and stomped downstairs to his study.\\n\\n I was hanging my pants up in the closet when I noticed Madam Octa\u0027s cage. Slowly, I pulled it out. She was lying in the middle, breathing easily, calm as ever.\\n\\n I studied the colorful spider and wasn\u0027t impressed by what I saw. She was bright, yes, but ugly and hairy and nasty. I began to hate her. She was the real villain, the one who bit Steve for no good reason. I had fed her and cared for her and played with her. This was how she repaid me.\\n\\n \"You stupid monster!\" I snarled, shaking the cage. \"You ungrateful creep!\"\\n\\n I gave the cage another shake. Her legs gripped the bars tightly. This made me madder and I yanked the cage roughly from side to side, trying to make her lose her grip, hoping to hurt her.\\n\\n I spun in a circle, whirling the cage around by the handle. I was swearing, calling her every name under the sun, wishing she was dead, wishing I\u0027d never set eyes on her, wishing I had the guts to take her out of the cage and squeeze her to death.\\n\\n Finally, as my rage reached its boiling point, I hurled the cage as far away from me as possible. I wasn\u0027t looking where I was throwing, and got a shock when I saw it sail through the open window and out into the night.\\n\\n I watched it flying away, then hurried after it. I was scared it would hit the ground and break open, because I knew if the doctors weren\u0027t able to save Steve by themselves, they might be able to with the help of Madam Octa: if they studied her, they might find out how to cure him. But if she escaped...\\n\\n I rushed to the window. I was too late to grab for the cage but at least I could see where it landed. I watched as it floated out and down, praying it wouldn\u0027t break. It seemed to take forever to fall.\\n\\n Just before it hit the ground, a hand darted out from the shadows of the night and snatched it from the air.\\n\\n A hand?!\\n\\n I leaned forward quickly for a better view. It was a dark night and at first I couldn\u0027t see who was down there. But then the person stepped forward and all was revealed.\\n\\n First, I saw his wrinkly hands holding the cage. Then his long red clothes. Then his cropped orange hair. Then his long ugly scar. And, finally, his sharp toothy grin.\\n\\n It was Mr. Crepsley. The vampire.\\n\\n And he was smiling up at me! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cirque-du-freak-the-saga-of-darren-shan-1/page-23.html","bookId":1570,"book":{"id":1570,"title":"Cirque du Freak (The Saga of Darren Shan #1)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #1 : Cirque du Freak \\n Cirque du Freak is the first novel in The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan.
