{"id":10554,"no":12,"title":"XI. WAYSIDE GOSSIP.","content":"This was the pedler\u0027s promised story about Mrs. Mudge. “The last time I was round that way, I stopped, thinking maybe they might have some rags to dispose of for tin-ware. The old lady seemed glad to see me, and pretty soon she brought down a lot of white rags. I thought they seemed quite heavy for their bulk,—howsomever, I wasn\u0027t looking for any tricks, and I let it go. By-and-by, when I happened to be ransacking one of the bags, I came across half a dozen pounds or more of old iron tied up in a white cloth. That let the cat out of the bag. I knew why they were so heavy, then, I reckon I shan\u0027t call on Mrs. Mudge next time I go by.” “So you\u0027ve run off,” he continued, after a pause, “I like your spunk,—just what I should have done myself. But tell me how you managed to get off without the old chap\u0027s finding it out.” Paul related such of his adventures as he had not before told, his companion listening with marked approval. “I wish I\u0027d been there,” he said. “I\u0027d have given fifty cents, right out, to see how old Mudge looked, I calc\u0027late he\u0027s pretty well tired with his wild-goose chase by this time.” It was now twelve o\u0027clock, and both the travelers began to feel the pangs of hunger. “It\u0027s about time to bait, I calc\u0027late,” remarked the pedler. The unsophisticated reader is informed that the word “bait,” in New England phraseology, is applied to taking lunch or dining. At this point a green lane opened out of the public road, skirted on either side by a row of trees. Carpeted with green, it made a very pleasant dining-room. A red-and-white heifer browsing at a little distance looked up from her meal and surveyed the intruders with mild attention, but apparently satisfied that they contemplated no invasion of her rights, resumed her agreeable employment. Over an irregular stone wall our travelers looked into a thrifty apple-orchard laden with fruit. They halted beneath a spreading chestnut-tree which towered above its neighbors, and offered them a grateful shelter from the noonday sun. From the box underneath the seat, the pedler took out a loaf of bread, a slice of butter, and a tin pail full of doughnuts. Paul, on his side, brought out his bread and gingerbread. “I most generally carry round my own provisions,” remarked the pedler, between two mouthfuls. “It\u0027s a good deal cheaper and more convenient, too. Help yourself to the doughnuts. I always calc\u0027late to have some with me. I\u0027d give more for \u0027em any day than for rich cake that ain\u0027t fit for anybody. My mother used to beat everybody in the neighborhood on making doughnuts. She made \u0027em so good that we never knew when to stop eating. You wouldn\u0027t hardly believe it, but, when I was a little shaver, I remember eating twenty-three doughnuts at one time. Pretty nigh killed me.” “I should think it might,” said Paul, laughing. “Mother got so scared that she vowed she wouldn\u0027t fry another for three months, but I guess she kinder lost the run of the almanac, for in less than a week she turned out about a bushel more.” All this time the pedler was engaged in practically refuting the saying, that a man cannot do two things at once. With a little assistance from Paul, the stock of doughnuts on which he had been lavishing encomiums, diminished rapidly. It was evident that his attachment to this homely article of diet was quite as strong as ever. “Don\u0027t be afraid of them,” said he, seeing that Paul desisted from his efforts, “I\u0027ve got plenty more in the box.” Paul signified that his appetite was already appeased. “Then we might as well be jogging on. Hey, Goliah,” said he, addressing the horse, who with an air of great content, had been browsing while his master was engaged in a similar manner. “Queer name for a horse, isn\u0027t it? I wanted something out of the common way, so I asked mother for a name, and she gave me that. She\u0027s great on scripture names, mother is. She gave one to every one of her children. It didn\u0027t make much difference to her what they were as long as they were in the Bible. I believe she used to open the Bible at random, and take the first name she happened to come across. There are eight of us, and nary a decent name in the lot. My oldest brother\u0027s name is Abimelech. Then there\u0027s Pharaoh, and Ishmael, and Jonadab, for the boys, and Leah and Naomi, for the girls; but my name beats all. You couldn\u0027t guess it?” Paul shook his head. “I don\u0027t believe you could,” said the pedler, shaking his head in comic indignation. “It\u0027s Jehoshaphat. Ain\u0027t that a respectable name for the son of Christian parents?” Paul laughed. “It wouldn\u0027t be so bad,” continued the pedler, “if my other name was longer; but Jehoshaphat seems rather a long handle to put before Stubbs. I can\u0027t say I feel particularly proud of the name, though for use it\u0027ll do as well as any other. At any rate, it ain\u0027t quite so bad as the name mother pitched on for my youngest sister, who was lucky enough to die before she needed a name.” “What was it?” inquired Paul, really curious to know what name could be considered less desirable than Jehoshaphat. “It was Jezebel,” responded the pedler. “Everybody told mother \u0027twould never do; but she was kind of superstitious about it, because that was the first name she came to in the Bible, and so she thought it was the Lord\u0027s will that that name should be given to the child.” As Mr. Stubbs finished his disquisition upon names, there came in sight a small house, dark and discolored with age and neglect. He pointed this out to Paul with his whip-handle. “That,” said he, “is where old Keziah Onthank lives. Ever heard of him?” Paul had not. “He\u0027s the oldest man in these parts,” pursued his loquacious companion. “There\u0027s some folks that seem a dyin\u0027 all the time, and for all that manage to outlive half the young folks in the neighborhood. Old Keziah Onthank is a complete case in p\u0027int. As long ago as when I was cutting my teeth he was so old that nobody know\u0027d how old he was. He was so bowed over that he couldn\u0027t see himself in the looking-glass unless you put it on the floor, and I guess even then what he saw wouldn\u0027t pay him for his trouble. He was always ailin\u0027 some way or other. Now it was rheumatism, now the palsy, and then again the asthma. He had THAT awful. “He lived in the same tumble-down old shanty we have just passed,—so poor that nobody\u0027d take the gift of it. People said that he\u0027d orter go to the poorhouse, so that when he was sick—which was pretty much all the time—he\u0027d have somebody to take care of him. But he\u0027d got kinder attached to the old place, seein\u0027 he was born there, and never lived anywhere else, and go he wouldn\u0027t. “Everybody expected he was near his end, and nobody\u0027d have been surprised to hear of his death at any minute. But it\u0027s strange how some folks are determined to live on, as I said before. So Keziah, though he looked so old when I was a boy that it didn\u0027t seem as if he could look any older, kept on livin,\u0027 and livin\u0027, and arter I got married to Betsy Sprague, he was livin\u0027 still. “One day, I remember I was passin\u0027 by the old man\u0027s shanty, when I heard a dreadful groanin\u0027, and thinks I to myself, \u0027I shouldn\u0027t wonder if the old man was on his last legs.\u0027 So in I bolted. There he was, to be sure, a lyin\u0027, on the bed, all curled up into a heap, breathin\u0027 dreadful hard, and lookin\u0027 as white and pale as any ghost. I didn\u0027t know exactly what to do, so I went and got some water, but he motioned it away, and wouldn\u0027t drink it, but kept on groanin\u0027. “\u0027He mustn\u0027t be left here to die without any assistance,\u0027 thinks I, so I ran off as fast I could to find the doctor. “I found him eatin\u0027 dinner—— “Come quick,” says I, “to old Keziah Onthank\u0027s. He\u0027s dyin\u0027, as sure as my name is Jehoshaphat.” “Well,” said the doctor, “die or no die, I can\u0027t come till I\u0027ve eaten my dinner.” “But he\u0027s dyin\u0027, doctor.” “Oh, nonsense. Talk of old Keziah Onthank\u0027s dyin\u0027. He\u0027ll live longer than I shall.” “I recollect I thought the doctor very unfeelin\u0027 to talk so of a fellow creetur, just stepping into eternity, as a body may say. However, it\u0027s no use drivin\u0027 a horse that\u0027s made up his mind he won\u0027t go, so although I did think the doctor dreadful deliberate about eatin\u0027 his dinner (he always would take half an hour for it), I didn\u0027t dare to say a word for fear he wouldn\u0027t come at all. You see the doctor was dreadful independent, and was bent on havin\u0027 his own way, pretty much, though for that matter I think it\u0027s the case with most folks. However, to come back to my story, I didn\u0027t feel particularly comfortable while I was waitin\u0027 his motions. “After a long while the doctor got ready. I was in such a hurry that I actilly pulled him along, he walked so slow; but he only laughed, and I couldn\u0027t help thinkin\u0027 that doctorin\u0027 had a hardinin\u0027 effect on the heart. I was determined if ever I fell sick I wouldn\u0027t send for him. “At last we got there. I went in all of a tremble, and crept to the bed, thinkin\u0027 I should see his dead body. But he wasn\u0027t there at all. I felt a little bothered you\u0027d better believe.” “Well,” said the doctor, turning to me with a smile, “what do you think now?” “I don\u0027t know what to think,” said I. “Then I\u0027ll help you,” said he. “So sayin\u0027, he took me to the winder, and what do you think I see? As sure as I\u0027m alive, there was the old man in the back yard, a squattin\u0027 down and pickin\u0027 up chips.” “And is he still living?” “Yes, or he was when I come along last. The doctor\u0027s been dead these ten years. He told me old Keziah would outlive him, but I didn\u0027t believe him. I shouldn\u0027t be surprised if he lived forever.” Paul listened with amused interest to this and other stories with which his companion beguiled the way. They served to divert his mind from the realities of his condition, and the uncertainty which hung over his worldly prospects. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2993/82567.html","bookId":319,"book":{"id":319,"title":"Paul Prescott\u0027s Charge","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, pompous-looking man, whose age appeared to verge close upon fifty.
