{"id":10564,"no":22,"title":"XXI. SMITH AND THOMPSON\u0027S YOUNG MAN.","content":"At seven o\u0027clock the next morning Paul stood before Smith \u0026 Thompson\u0027s store. As he came up on one side, another boy came down on the other, and crossed the street. “Are you the new boy?” he asked, surveying Paul attentively. “I suppose so,” said Paul. “I\u0027ve engaged to work for Smith \u0026 Thompson.” “All right. I\u0027m glad to see you,” said the other. This looked kind, and Paul thanked him for his welcome. “O.” said the other, bursting into a laugh, “you needn\u0027t trouble yourself about thanking me. I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve come, because now I shan\u0027t have to open the store and sweep out. Just lend a hand there; I\u0027ll help you about taking down the shutters this morning, and to-morrow you\u0027ll have to get along alone.” The two boys opened the store. “What\u0027s your name?” asked Paul\u0027s new acquaintance. “Paul Prescott. What is yours?” “Nicholas Benton. You may call me MR. Benton.” “Mr. Benton?” repeated Paul in some astonishment. “Yes; I\u0027m a young man now. I\u0027ve been Smith \u0026 Thompson\u0027s boy till now. Now I\u0027m promoted.” Paul looked at MR. Benton with some amusement. That young man was somewhat shorter than himself, and sole proprietor of a stock of pale yellow hair which required an abundant stock of bear\u0027s grease to keep it in order. His face was freckled and expressionless. His eyebrows and eyelashes were of the same faded color. He was dressed, however, with some pretensions to smartness. He wore a blue necktie, of large dimensions, fastened by an enormous breast-pin, which, in its already tarnished splendor, suggested strong doubts as to the apparent gold being genuine. “There\u0027s the broom, Paul,” said Mr. Benton, assuming a graceful position on the counter. “You\u0027ll have to sweep out; only look sharp about raising a dust, or Smith\u0027ll be into your wool.” “What sort of a man is Mr. Smith?” asked Paul, with some curiosity. “O, he\u0027s an out and outer. Sharp as a steel trap. He\u0027ll make you toe the mark.” “Do you like him?” asked Paul, not quite sure whether he understood his employer\u0027s character from the description. “I don\u0027t like him well enough to advise any of my folks to trade with him,” said Mr. Benton. “Why not?” “He\u0027d cheat \u0027em out of their eye teeth if they happened to have any,” said the young man coolly, beginning to pick his teeth with a knife. Paul began to doubt whether he should like Mr. Smith. “I say,” said Mr. Benton after a pause, “have you begun to shave yet?” Paul looked up to see if his companion were in earnest. “No,” said he; “I haven\u0027t got along as far as that. Have you?” “I,” repeated the young man, a little contemptuously, “of course I have. I\u0027ve shaved for a year and a half.” “Do you find it hard shaving?” asked Paul, a little slyly. “Well, my beard is rather stiff,” said the late BOY, with an important air, “but I\u0027ve got used to it.” “Ain\u0027t you rather young to shave, Nicholas?” asked Paul. “Mr. Benton, if you please.” “I mean, Mr. Benton.” “Perhaps I was when I begun. But now I am nineteen.” “Nineteen?” “Yes, that is to say, I\u0027m within a few months of being nineteen. What do you think of my moustache?” “I hadn\u0027t noticed it.” “The store\u0027s rather dark,” muttered Mr. Benton, who seemed a little annoyed by this answer. “If you\u0027ll come a little nearer you can see it.” Drawing near, Paul, after some trouble, descried a few scattering hairs. “Yes,” said he, wanting to laugh, “I see it.” “Coming on finely, isn\u0027t it?” asked Mr. Nicholas Benton, complacently. “Yes,” said Paul, rather doubtfully. “I don\u0027t mind letting you into a secret,” said Benton, affably, “if you won\u0027t mention it. I\u0027ve been using some of the six weeks\u0027 stuff.” “The what?” asked Paul, opening his eyes. “Haven\u0027t you heard of it?” inquired Benton, a little contemptuously. “Where have you been living all your life? Haven\u0027t you seen it advertised,—warranted to produce a full set of whiskers or moustaches upon the smoothest face, etc. I got some a week ago, only a dollar. Five weeks from now you\u0027ll see something that\u0027ll astonish you.” Paul was not a little amused by his new companion, and would have laughed, but that he feared to offend him. “You\u0027d better get some,” said Mr. Benton. “I\u0027ll let you just try mine once, if you want to.” “Thank you,” said Paul; “I don\u0027t think I want to have a moustache just yet.” “Well, perhaps you\u0027re right. Being a boy, perhaps it wouldn\u0027t be advisable.” “When does Mr. Smith come in?” “Not till nine.” “And the other clerks?” “About eight o\u0027clock. I shan\u0027t come till eight, to-morrow morning.” “There\u0027s one thing I should like to ask you,” said Paul. “Of course you won\u0027t answer unless you like.” “Out with it.” “How much does Mr. Smith pay you?” “Ahem!” said Benton, “what does he pay you?” “A dollar and a quarter a week.” “He paid me a dollar and a half to begin with.” “Did he? He wanted me to come first at a dollar.” “Just like him. Didn\u0027t I tell you he was an out and outer? He\u0027ll be sure to take you in if you will let him.” “But,” said Paul, anxiously, “he said he\u0027d raise it in a month or two.” “He won\u0027t offer to; you\u0027ll have to tease him. And then how much\u0027ll he raise it? Not more than a quarter. How much do you think I get now?” “How long have you been here?” “A year and a half.” “Five dollars a week,” guessed Paul. “Five! he only gives me two and a half. That is, he hasn\u0027t been paying me but that. Now, of course, he\u0027ll raise, as I\u0027ve been promoted.” “How much do you expect to get now?” “Maybe four dollars, and I\u0027m worth ten any day. He\u0027s a mean old skinflint, Smith is.” This glimpse at his own prospects did not tend to make Paul feel very comfortable. He could not repress a sigh of disappointment when he thought of this mortifying termination of all his brilliant prospects. He had long nourished the hope of being able to repay the good sexton for his outlay in his behalf, besides discharging the debt which his father had left behind him. Now there seemed to be little prospect of either. He had half a mind to resign his place immediately upon the entrance of Mr. Smith, but two considerations dissuaded him; one, that the sum which he was to receive, though small, would at least buy his clothes, and besides, he was not at all certain of obtaining another situation. With a sigh, therefore, he went about his duties. He had scarcely got the store ready when some of the clerks entered, and the business of the day commenced. At nine Mr. Smith appeared. “So you\u0027re here, Peter,” remarked he, as he caught sight of our hero. “Paul,” corrected the owner of that name. “Well, well, Peter or Paul, don\u0027t make much difference. Both were apostles, if I remember right. All ready for work, eh?” “Yes, sir,” said Paul, neither very briskly nor cheerfully. “Well,” said Mr. Smith, after a pause, “I guess I\u0027ll put you into the calico department. Williams, you may take him under your wing. And now Peter,—all the same, Paul,—I\u0027ve got a word or two to say to you, as I always do to every boy who comes into my store. Don\u0027t forget what you\u0027re here for? It\u0027s to sell goods. Take care to sell something to every man, woman, and child, that comes in your way. That\u0027s the way to do business. Follow it up, and you\u0027ll be a rich man some day.” “But suppose they don\u0027t want anything?” said Paul. “Make \u0027em want something,” returned Smith, “Don\u0027t let \u0027em off without buying. That\u0027s my motto. However, you\u0027ll learn.” Smith bustled off, and began in his nervous way to exercise a general supervision over all that was going on in the store. He seemed to be all eyes. While apparently entirely occupied in waiting upon a customer, he took notice of all the customers in the store, and could tell what they bought, and how much they paid. Paul listened attentively to the clerk under whom he was placed for instruction. “What\u0027s the price of this calico?” inquired a common-looking woman. “A shilling a yard, ma\u0027am,” (this was not in war times.) “It looks rather coarse.” “Coarse, ma\u0027am! What can you be thinking of? It is a superfine piece of goods. We sell more of it than of any other figure. The mayor\u0027s wife was in here yesterday, and bought two dress patterns off of it.” “Did she?” asked the woman, who appeared favorably impressed by this circumstance. “Yes, and she promised to send her friends here after some of it. You\u0027d better take it while you can get it.” “Will it wash?” “To be sure it will.” “Then I guess you may cut me off ten yards.” This was quickly done, and the woman departed with her purchase. Five minutes later, another woman entered with a bundle of the same figured calico. Seeing her coming, Williams hastily slipped the remnant of the piece out of sight. “I got this calico here,” said the newcomer, “one day last week. You warranted it to wash, but I find it won\u0027t. Here\u0027s a piece I\u0027ve tried.” She showed a pattern, which had a faded look. “You\u0027ve come to the wrong store,” said Williams, coolly. “You must have got the calico somewhere else.” “No, I\u0027m sure I got it here. I remember particularly buying it of you.” “You\u0027ve got a better memory than I have, then. We haven\u0027t got a piece of calico like that in the store.” Paul listened to this assertion with unutterable surprise. “I am quite certain I bought it here,” said the woman, perplexed. “Must have been the next store,—Blake \u0026 Hastings. Better go over there.” The woman went out. “That\u0027s the way to do business,” said Williams, winking at Paul. Paul said nothing, but he felt more than ever doubtful about retaining his place. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2993/82577.html","bookId":319,"book":{"id":319,"title":"Paul Prescott\u0027s Charge","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, pompous-looking man, whose age appeared to verge close upon fifty.
