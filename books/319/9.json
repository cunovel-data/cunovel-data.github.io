{"id":10551,"no":9,"title":"VIII. A FRIEND IN NEED.","content":"Our hero did not stop till he had put a good five miles between himself and the poorhouse. He knew that it would not be long before Mr. Mudge would discover his absence, and the thought of being carried back was doubly distasteful to him now that he had, even for a short time, felt the joy of being his own master. His hurried walk, taken in the fresh morning air, gave him quite a sharp appetite. Luckily he had the means of gratifying it. The night before he had secreted half his supper, knowing that he should need it more the next morning. He thought he might now venture to sit down and eat it. At a little distance from the road was a spring, doubtless used for cattle, since it was situated at the lower end of a pasture. Close beside and bending over it was a broad, branching oak, which promised a cool and comfortable shelter. “That\u0027s just the place for me,” thought Paul, who felt thirsty as well as hungry, “I think I will take breakfast here and rest awhile before I go any farther.” So saying he leaped lightly over the rail fence, and making his way to the place indicated, sat down in the shadow of the tree. Scooping up some water in the hollow of his hand, he drank a deep and refreshing draught. He next proceeded to pull out of his pocket a small package, which proved to contain two small pieces of bread. His long morning walk had given him such an appetite that he was not long in despatching all he had. It is said by some learned physicians, who no doubt understand the matter, that we should always rise from the table with an appetite. Probably Paul had never heard of this rule. Nevertheless, he seemed in a fair way of putting it into practice, for the best of reasons, because he could not help it. His breakfast, though not the most inviting, being simply unbuttered bread and rather dry at that, seemed more delicious than ever before, but unfortunately there was not enough of it. However, as there seemed likely to be no more forthcoming, he concluded in default of breakfast to lie down under the tree for a few minutes before resuming his walk. Though he could not help wondering vaguely where his dinner was to come from, as that time was several hours distant, he wisely decided not to anticipate trouble till it came. Lying down under the tree, Paul began to consider what Mr. Mudge would say when he discovered that he had run away. “He\u0027ll have to milk the cows himself,” thought Paul. “He won\u0027t fancy that much. Won\u0027t Mrs. Mudge scold, thought? I\u0027m glad I shan\u0027t be within hearing.” “Holloa!” It was a boy\u0027s voice that Paul heard. Looking up he saw a sedate company of cows entering the pasture single file through an aperture made by letting down the bars. Behind them walked a boy of about his own size, flourishing a stout hickory stick. The cows went directly to the spring from which Paul had already drunk. The young driver looked at our hero with some curiosity, wondering, doubtless, what brought him there so early in the morning. After a little hesitation he said, remarking Paul\u0027s bundle, “Where are you traveling?” “I don\u0027t know exactly,” said Paul, who was not quite sure whether it would be politic to avow his destination. “Don\u0027t know?” returned the other, evidently surprised. “Not exactly; I may go to New York.” “New York! That\u0027s a great ways off. Do you know the way there?” “No, but I can find it.” “Are you going all alone?” asked his new acquaintance, who evidently thought Paul had undertaken a very formidable journey. “Yes.” “Are you going to walk all the way?” “Yes, unless somebody offers me a ride now and then.” “But why don\u0027t you ride in the stage, or in the cars? You would get there a good deal quicker.” “One reason,” said Paul, hesitating a little, “is because I have no money to pay for riding.” “Then how do you expect to live? Have you had any breakfast, this morning?” “I brought some with me, and just got through eating it when you came along.” “And where do you expect to get any dinner?” pursued his questioner, who was evidently not a little puzzled by the answers he received. “I don\u0027t know,” returned Paul. His companion looked not a little confounded at this view of the matter, but presently a bright thought struck him. “I shouldn\u0027t wonder,” he said, shrewdly, “if you were running away.” Paul hesitated a moment. He knew that his case must look a little suspicious, thus unexplained, and after a brief pause for reflection determined to take the questioner into his confidence. He did this the more readily because his new acquaintance looked very pleasant. “You\u0027ve guessed right,” he said; “if you\u0027ll promise not to tell anybody, I\u0027ll tell you all about it.” This was readily promised, and the boy who gave his name as John Burgess, sat down beside Paul, while he, with the frankness of boyhood, gave a circumstantial account of his father\u0027s death, and the ill-treatment he had met with subsequently. “Do you come from Wrenville?” asked John, interested. “Why, I\u0027ve got relations there. Perhaps you know my cousin, Ben Newcome.” “Is Ben Newcome your cousin? O yes, I know him very well; he\u0027s a first-rate fellow.” “He isn\u0027t much like his father.” “Not at all. If he was”— “You wouldn\u0027t like him so well. Uncle talks a little too much out of the dictionary, and walks so straight that he bends backward. But I say, Paul, old Mudge deserves to be choked, and Mrs. Mudge should be obliged to swallow a gallon of her own soup. I don\u0027t know but that would be worse than choking. I wouldn\u0027t have stayed so long if I had been in your place.” “I shouldn\u0027t,” said Paul, “if it hadn\u0027t been for Aunt Lucy.” “Was she an aunt of yours?” “No, but we used to call her so, She\u0027s the best friend I\u0027ve got, and I don\u0027t know but the only one,” said Paul, a little sadly. “No, she isn\u0027t,” said John, quickly; “I\u0027ll be your friend, Paul. Sometime, perhaps, I shall go to New York, myself, and then I will come and see you. Where do you expect to be?” “I don\u0027t know anything about the city,” said Paul, “but if you come, I shall be sure to see you somewhere. I wish you were going now.” Neither Paul nor his companion had much idea of the extent of the great metropolis, or they would not have taken it so much as a matter of course that, being in the same place, they should meet each other. Their conversation was interrupted by the ringing of a bell from a farmhouse within sight. “That\u0027s our breakfast-bell,” said John rising from the grass. “It is meant for me. I suppose they wonder what keeps me so long. Won\u0027t you come and take breakfast with me, Paul?” “I guess not,” said Paul, who would have been glad to do so had he followed the promptings of his appetite. “I\u0027m afraid your folks would ask me questions, and then it would be found out that I am running away.” “I didn\u0027t think of that,” returned John, after a pause. “You haven\u0027t got any dinner with you?” he said a moment after. “No.” “Well, I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. Come with me as far as the fence, and lie down there till I\u0027ve finished breakfast. Then I\u0027ll bring something out for you, and maybe I\u0027ll walk along a little way with you.” “You are very kind,” said Paul, gratefully. “Oh, nonsense,” said John, “that\u0027s nothing. Besides, you know we are going to be friends.” “John! breakfast\u0027s ready.” “There\u0027s Nelson calling me,” said John, hurriedly. “I must leave you; there\u0027s the fence; lie down there, and I\u0027ll be back in a jiffy.” “John, I say, why don\u0027t you come?” “I\u0027m coming. You mustn\u0027t think everybody\u0027s got such a thundering great appetite as you, Nelson.” “I guess you\u0027ve got enough to keep you from pining away,” said Nelson, good-naturedly, “you\u0027re twice as fat as I am.” “That\u0027s because I work harder,” said John, rather illogically. The brothers went in to breakfast. But a few minutes elapsed before John reappeared, bearing under his arm a parcel wrapped up in an old newspaper. He came up panting with the haste he had made. “It didn\u0027t take you long to eat breakfast,” said Paul. “No, I hurried through it; I thought you would get tired of waiting. And now I\u0027ll walk along with you a little ways. But wait here\u0027s something for you.” So saying he unrolled the newspaper and displayed a loaf of bread, fresh and warm, which looked particularly inviting to Paul, whose scanty breakfast had by no means satisfied his appetite. Besides this, there was a loaf of molasses ginger-bread, with which all who were born in the country, or know anything of New England housekeeping, are familiar. “There,” said John, “I guess that\u0027ll be enough for your dinner.” “But how did you get it without having any questions asked?” inquired our hero. “Oh,” said John, “I asked mother for them, and when she asked what I wanted of them, I told her that I\u0027d answer that question to-morrow. You see I wanted to give you a chance to get off out of the way, though mother wouldn\u0027t tell, even if she knew.” “All right,” said Paul, with satisfaction. He could not help looking wistfully at the bread, which looked very inviting to one accustomed to poorhouse fare. “If you wouldn\u0027t mind,” he said hesitating, “I would like to eat a little of the bread now.” “Mind, of course not,” said John, breaking off a liberal slice. “Why didn\u0027t I think of that before? Walking must have given you a famous appetite.” John looked on with evident approbation, while Paul ate with great apparent appetite. “There,” said he with a sigh of gratification, as he swallowed the last morsel, “I haven\u0027t tasted anything so good for a long time.” “Is it as good as Mrs. Mudge\u0027s soup?” asked John, mischievously. “Almost,” returned Paul, smiling. We must now leave the boys to pursue their way, and return to the dwelling from which our hero had so unceremoniously taken his departure, and from which danger now threatened him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2993/82564.html","bookId":319,"book":{"id":319,"title":"Paul Prescott\u0027s Charge","description":"简介： The speaker was a tall, pompous-looking man, whose age appeared to verge close upon fifty.
