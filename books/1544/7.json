{"id":106698,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"CHAPTER SEVEN OLD NARNIA IN DANGER THE place where they had met the Fauns was, of course, Dancing Lawn itself, and here Caspian and his friends remained till the night of the great Council. To sleep under the stars, to drink nothing but well water and to live chiefly on nuts and wild fruit, was a strange experience for Caspian after his bed with silken sheets in a tapestried chamber at the castle, with meals laid out on gold and silver dishes in the anteroom, and attendants ready at his call. But he had never enjoyed himself more. Never had sleep been more refreshing nor food tasted more savoury, and he began already to harden and his face wore a kinglier look. When the great night came, and his various strange subjects came stealing into the lawn by ones and twos and threes or by sixes and sevens - the moon then shining almost at her full - his heart swelled as he saw their numbers and heard their greetings. All whom he had met were there: Bulgy Bears and Red Dwarfs and Black Dwarfs, Moles and Badgers, Hares and Hedgehogs, and others whom he had not yet seen - five Satyrs as red as foxes, the whole contingent of Talking Mice, armed to the teeth and following a shrill trumpet, some Owls, the Old Raven of Ravenscaur. Last of all (and this took Caspian\u0027s breath away), with the Centaurs came a small but genuine Giant, Wimbleweather of Deadman\u0027s Hill, carrying on his back a basketful of rather sea-sick Dwarfs who had accepted his offer of a lift and were now wishing they had walked instead. The Bulgy Bears were very anxious to have the feast first and leave the council till afterwards: perhaps till tomorrow. Reepicheep and his Mice said that councils and feasts could both wait, and proposed storming Miraz in his own castle that very night. Pattertwig and the other Squirrels said they could talk and eat at the same time, so why not have the council and feast all at once? The Moles proposed throwing up entrenchments round the Lawn before they did anything else. The Fauns thought it would be better to begin with a solemn dance. The Old Raven, while agreeing with the Bears that it would take too long to have a full council before supper, begged to be allowed to give a brief address to the whole company. But Caspian and the Centaurs and the Dwarfs overruled all these suggestions and insisted on holding a real council of war at once. When all the other creatures had been persuaded to sit down quietly in a great circle, and when (with more difficulty) they had got Pattertwig to stop running to and fro and saying \"Silence! Silence, everyone, for the King\u0027s speech\", Caspian, feeling a little nervous, got up. \"Narnians!\" he began, but he never got any further, for at that very moment Camillo the Hare said, \"Hush! There\u0027s a Man somewhere near.\" They were all creatures of the wild, accustomed to being hunted, and they all became still as statues. The beasts all turned their noses in the direction which Camillo had indicated. \"Smells like Man and yet not quite like Man,\" whispered Trufflehunter. \"It\u0027s getting steadily nearer,\" said Camillo. \"Two badgers and you three Dwarfs, with your bows at the - ready, go softly off to meet it,\" said Caspian. \"We\u0027ll settle \u0027un,\" said a Black Dwarf grimly, fitting a shaft to his bowstring. \"Don\u0027t shoot if it is alone,\" said Caspian. \"Catch it.\" \"Why?\" asked the Dwarf. \"Do as you\u0027re told,\" said Glenstorm the Centaur. Everyone waited in silence while the three Dwarfs and two Badgers trotted stealthily across to the trees on the northwest side of the Lawn. Then came a sharp dwarfish cry, \"Stop! Who goes there?\" and a sudden spring. A moment later a voice, which Caspian knew well, could he heard saying, \"All right, all right, I\u0027m unarmed. Take my wrists if you like, worthy Badgers, but don\u0027t bite right through them. I want to speak to the King.\" \"Doctor Cornelius!\" cried Caspian with joy, and rushed forward to greet his old tutor. Everyone else crowded round. \"Pah!\" said Nikabrik. \"A renegade Dwarf. A half-and-halfer! Shall I pass my sword through its throat?\" \"Be quiet, Nikabrik,\" said Trumpkin. \"The creature can\u0027t help its ancestry.\" \"This is my greatest friend and the saviour of my life,\" said Caspian. \"And anyone who doesn\u0027t like his company may leave my army: at once. Dearest doctor, I am glad to see you again. How ever did you find us out?\" \"By a little use of simple magic, your Majesty,\" said the Doctor, who was still puffing and blowing from having walked so fast. \"But there\u0027s no time to go into that now. We must all fly from this place at once. You are already betrayed and Miraz is on the move. Before midday tomorrow you will be surrounded.\" \"Betrayed!\" said Caspian. \"And by whom?\" \"Another renegade Dwarf, no doubt,\" said Nikabrik. \"By your horse Destrier,\" said Doctor Cornelius. \"The poor brute knew no better. When you were knocked off, of course, he went dawdling back to his stable in the castle. Then the secret of your flight was known. I made myself scarce, having no wish to be questioned about it in Miraz\u0027s torture chamber. I had a pretty good guess from my crystal as to where I should find you. But all day - that was the day before yesterday - I saw Miraz\u0027s tracking parties out in the woods. Yesterday I learned that his army is out. I don\u0027t think some of your - um - pure-blooded Dwarfs have as much woodcraft as might be expected. You\u0027ve left tracks all over the place. Great carelessness. At any rate something has warned Miraz that Old Narnia is not so dead as he had hoped, and he is on the move.\" \"Hurrah!\" said a very shrill and small voice from somewhere at the Doctor\u0027s feet. \"Let them come! All I ask is that the King will put me and my people in the front.\" \"What on earth?\" said Doctor Cornelius. \"Has your Majesty got grasshoppers - or mosquitoes - in your army?\" Then after stooping down and peering carefully through his spectacles, he broke into a laugh. \"By the Lion,\" he swore, \"it\u0027s a mouse. Signior Mouse, I desire your better acquaintance. I am honoured by meeting so valiant a beast.\" \"My friendship you shall have, learned Man,\" piped Reepicheep. \"And any Dwarf - or Giant - in the army who does not give you good language shall have my sword to reckon with.\" \"Is there time for this foolery?\" asked Nikabrik. \"What are our plans? Battle or flight?\" \"Battle if need be,\" said Trumpkin. \"But we are hardly ready for it yet, and this is no very defensible place.\" \"I don\u0027t like the idea of running away,\" said Caspian. \"Hear him! Hear him!\" said the Bulgy Bears. \"Whatever we do, don\u0027t let\u0027s have any running. Especially not before supper; and not too soon after it neither.\" \"Those who run first do not always run last,\" said the Centaur. \"And why should we let the enemy choose our position instead of choosing it ourselves? Let us find a strong place.\" \"That\u0027s wise, your Majesty, that\u0027s wise,\" said Trufflehunter. \"But where are we to go?\" asked several voices. \"Your Majesty,\" said Doctor Cornelius, \"and all you variety of creatures, I think we must fly east and down the river to the great woods. The Telmarines hate that region. They have always been afraid of the sea and of something that may come over the sea. That is why they have let the great woods grow up. If traditions speak true, the ancient Cair Paravel was at the river-mouth. All that part is friendly to us and hateful to our enemies. We must go to Aslan\u0027s How.\" \"Aslan\u0027s How?\" said several voices. \"We do not know what it is.\" \"It lies within the skirts of the Great Woods and it is a huge mound which Narnians raised in very ancient times over a very magical place, where there stood - and perhaps still stands - a very magical Stone. The Mound is all hollowed out within into galleries and caves, and the Stone is in the central cave of all. There is room in the mound for all our stores, and those of us who have most need of cover and are most accustomed to underground life can be lodged in the caves. The rest of us can lie in the wood. At a pinch all of us (except this worthy Giant) could retreat into the Mound itself, and there we should be beyond the reach of every danger except famine.\" \"It is a good thing we have a learned man among us,\" said Trufflehunter; but Trumpkin muttered under his breath, \"Soup and celery! I wish our leaders would think less about these old wives\u0027 tales and more about victuals and arms.\" But all approved of Cornelius\u0027s proposal and that very night, half an hour later, they were on the march. Before sunrise they arrived at Aslan\u0027s How. It was certainly an awesome place, a round green hill on top of another hill, long since grown over with trees, and one little, low doorway leading into it. The tunnels inside were a perfect maze till you got to know them, and they were lined and roofed with smooth stones, and on the stones, peering in the twilight, Caspian saw strange characters and snaky patterns, and pictures in which the form of a Lion was repeated again and again. It all seemed to belong to an even older Narnia than the Narnia of which his nurse had told him. It was after they had taken up their quarters in and around the How that fortune began to turn against them. King Miraz\u0027s scouts soon found their new lair, and he and his army arrived on the edge of the woods. And as so often happens, the enemy turned out stronger than they had reckoned. Caspian\u0027s heart sank as he saw company after company arriving. And though Miraz\u0027s men may have been afraid of going into the wood, they were even more afraid of Miraz, and with him in command they carried battle deeply into it and sometimes almost to the How itself. Caspian and other captains of course made many sorties into the open country. Thus there was fighting on most days and sometimes by night as well; but Caspian\u0027s party had on the whole the worst of it. At last there came a night when everything had gone as badly as possible, and the rain which had been falling heavily all day had ceased at nightfall only to give place to raw cold. That morning Caspian had arranged what was his biggest battle yet, and all had hung their hopes on it. He, with most of the Dwarfs, was to have fallen on the King\u0027s right wing at daybreak, and then, when they were heavily engaged, Giant Wimbleweather, with the Centaurs and some of the fiercest beasts, was to have broken out from another place and endeavoured to cut the King\u0027s right off from the rest of the army. But it had all failed. No one had warned Caspian (because no one in these later days of Narnia remembered) that Giants are not at all clever. Poor Wimbleweather, though as brave as a lion, was a true Giant in that respect. He had broken out at the wrong time and from the wrong place, and both his party and Caspian\u0027s had suffered badly and done the enemy little harm. The best of the Bears had been hurt, a Centaur terribly wounded, and there were few in Caspian\u0027s party who had not lost blood. It was a gloomy company that huddled under the dripping trees to eat their scanty supper. The gloomiest of all was Giant Wimbleweather. He knew it was all his fault. He sat in silence shedding big tears which collected on the end of his nose and then fell off with a huge splash on the whole bivouac of the Mice, who had just been beginning to get warm and drowsy. They all jumped up, shaking the water out of their ears and wringing their little blankets, and asked the Giant in shrill but forcible voices whether he thought they weren\u0027t wet enough without this sort of thing. And then other people woke up and told the Mice they had been enrolled as scouts and not as a concert party, and asked why they couldn\u0027t keep quiet. And Wimbleweather tiptoed away to find some place where he could be miserable in peace and stepped on somebody\u0027s tail and somebody (they said afterwards it was a fox) bit him. And so everyone was out of temper. But in the secret and magical chamber at the heart of the How, King Caspian, with Cornelius and the Badger and Nikabrik and Trumpkin, were at council. Thick pillars of ancient workmanship supported the roof. In the centre was the Stone itself - a stone table, split right down the centre, and covered with what had once been writing of some kind: but ages of wind and rain and snow had almost worn them away in old times when the Stone Table had stood on the hilltop, and the Mound had not yet been built above it. They were not using the Table nor sitting round it: it was too magic a thing for any common use. They sat on logs a little way from it, and between them was a rough wooden table, on which stood a rude clay lamp lighting up their pale faces and throwing big shadows on the walls. \"If your Majesty is ever to use the Horn,\" said Trufflehunter, \"I think the time has now come.\" Caspian had of course told them of his treasure several days ago. \"We are certainly in great need,\" answered Caspian. \"But it is hard to be sure we are at our greatest. Supposing there came an even worse need and we had already used it?\" \"By that argument,\" said Nikabrik, \"your Majesty will never use it until it is too late.\" \"I agree with that,\" said Doctor Cornelius. \"And what do you think, Trumpkin?\" asked Caspian. \"Oh, as for me,\" said the Red Dwarf, who had been listening with complete indifference, \"your Majesty knows I think the Horn - and that bit of broken stone over there and your great King Peter - and your Lion Aslan - are all eggs in moonshine. It\u0027s all one to me when your Majesty blows the Horn. All I insist on is that the army is told nothing about it. There\u0027s no good raising hopes of magical help which (as I think) are sure to be disappointed.\" \"Then in the name of Aslan we will wind Queen Susan\u0027s Horn,\" said Caspian. \"There is one thing, Sire,\" said Doctor Cornelius, \"that should perhaps be done first. We do not know what form the help will take. It might call Aslan himself from oversea. But I think it is more likely to call Peter the High King and his mighty consorts down from the high past. But in either case, I do not think we can be sure that the help will come to this very spot - \" \"You never said a truer word,\" put in Trumpkin. \"I think,\" went on the learned man, \"that they - or he will come back to one or other of the Ancient Places of Narnia. This, where we now sit, is the most ancient and most deeply magical of all, and here, I think, the answer is likeliest to come. But there are two others. One Lantern Waste, up-river, west of Beaversdam, where the Royal Children first appeared in Narnia, as the records tell The other is down at the river-mouth, where their castle of Cair Paravel once stood. And if Aslan himself comes, that would be the best place for meeting him too, for every story says that he is the son of the great Emperor-over-the-Sea, and over the sea he will pass. I should like very much to send messengers to both places, to Lantern Waste and the river-mouth, to receive them - or him or it.\" \"Just as I thought,\" muttered Trumpkin. \"The first result of all this foolery is not to bring us help but to lose us two fighters.\" \"Who would you think of sending, Doctor Cornelius?\" asked Caspian. \"Squirrels are best for getting through enemy country without being caught,\" said Trufflehunter. \"All our squirrels (and we haven\u0027t many),\" said Nikabrik, \"are rather flighty. The only one I\u0027d trust on a job like that would be Pattertwig.\" \"Let it be Pattertwig, then,\" said King Caspian. \"And who for our other messenger? I know you\u0027d go, Trufflehunter, but you haven\u0027t the speed. Nor you, Doctor Cornelius.\" \"I won\u0027t go,\" said Nikabrik. \"With all these Humans and beasts about, there must be a Dwarf here to see that the Dwarfs are fairly treated.\" \"Thimbles and thunderstorms!\" cried Trumpkin in a rage. \"Is that how you speak to the King? Send me, Sire, I\u0027ll go.\" \"But I thought you didn\u0027t believe in the Horn, Trumpkin,\" said Caspian. \"No more I do, your Majesty. But what\u0027s that got to do with it? I might as well die on a wild goose chase as die here. You are my King. I know the difference between giving advice and taking orders. You\u0027ve had my advice, and now it\u0027s the time for orders.\" \"I will never forget this, Trumpkin,\" said Caspian. \"Send for Pattertwig, one of you. And when shall I blow the Horn?\" \"I would wait for sunrise, your Majesty,\" said Doctor Cornelius. \"That sometimes has an effect in operations of White Magic.\" A few minutes later Pattertwig arrived and had his task explained to him. As he was, like many squirrels, full of courage and dash and energy and excitement and mischief (not to say conceit), he no sooner heard it than he was eager to be off. It was arranged that he should run for Lantern Waste while Trumpkin made the shorter journey to the river-mouth. After a hasty meal they both set off with the fervent thanks and good wishes of the King, the Badger, and Cornelius.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prince-caspian-the-chronicles-of-narnia-2/page-7.html","bookId":1544,"book":{"id":1544,"title":"Prince Caspian (The Chronicles of Narnia #2)","description":"Storyline: Prince Caspian (The Chronicles of Narnia (Publication Order) #2) A prince fights for his crown.
