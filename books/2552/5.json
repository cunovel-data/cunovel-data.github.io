{"id":111659,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"JOE . . . Father Joe gave the dirt on Zev\u0027s grave a final pat with his shovel, then tu rned away. He didn\u0027t know any of the Jewish prayers for the dead, so he\u0027d ma de up a prayer of his own to send his old friend on his way. Lacey walked beside him, a shovel across her shoulder. \"You were really clo se to him, weren\u0027t you.\" \"Like a brother. Closer than a brother. Brothers drag all sorts of baggage in to their relationship as adults. We had none of that. We didn\u0027t even share th e same culture.\" \"He seemed like a good man.\" \"He was. He had a kind, generous, gentle soul. I will miss him terribly.\" Joe\u0027s throat clenched. He still couldn\u0027t believe Zev was gone. He\u0027d feared h im dead after the vampires invaded, but hadn\u0027t really believed it. Now he ha d no choice. He looked around. Rifle- and shotgun-toting men stood at the corners of th e little church graveyard. Joe had found spots in the crowded soil for Zev and the four parishioners who\u0027d died during last night\u0027s fight, and this morning a crew of volunteers - Lacey among them - had started digging. He glanced at his niece, noting the sheen of perspiration on her bare arms, the nasty-looking bruise below her shoulder. It didn\u0027t seem to be botherin g her much this morning. She was in good shape and surprisingly strong. She\u0027d held her own with that shovel. The midday sun hung high and hot as they followed the walk around to the front of the church where half a dozen women were busy scrubbing the st eps. Two more armed men patrolled the sidewalk behind them. \"Good job, ladies,\" Joe said. The women smiled and waved. \"Sure looks better than it did this morning,\" Lacey said. Joe nodded. They\u0027d hurled the bodies of the vampires and the dead Vichy out the front door last night. In hindsight, that had been an error, because the morning sunlight created a terrible mess, reducing some of the undead cadav ers to a foul, brown goo that stained the steps and coated the Vichy bodies. Carl had found a front-end loader and the men used that to haul the stinking mess to a vacant lot where it was buried in a mass grave. Lacey stared at the stains. \"Lots of death last night.\" She turned to Joe, her eyes troubled. \"Why don\u0027t I feel bad?\" \"Maybe because this is war. A war like never before. In past wars the enem y gets propagandized into monsters, subhuman creatures. In this war we don\u0027t have to do that. They are subhuman monsters.\" \"And the Vichy?\" \"They\u0027re just subhuman.\" She continued to stare at him. \"This is not the Uncle Joe I knew.\" How right she was. He sensed that memories of last night\u0027s carnage and bl oodshed would keep him awake for months, maybe years. But he couldn\u0027t all ow himself to dwell on it. He had to move on. \"Thank God I\u0027m not. The old Father Joe would have tried to reason with the m. But I worry that many more scenes like last night will change us, make us more like them.\" \"So? Maybe we need to become more like them if we\u0027re to survive. In a war you have to submerge a lot of the decent impulses and empathy that made yo u a good partner or spouse or parent or neighbor. Especially in this war, because we\u0027re dealing with an enemy that has lost all decent impulses. You offer an olive branch and they\u0027ll shove it down your throat. Will we be c hanged by this? Look around you, Unk: we already are.\" He nodded. \"We\u0027ll all be either dead or permanently scarred when this is ove r. And so, in the unlikely event that we win, we\u0027ll still lose.\" He managed a smile for her. \"How\u0027s that for optimism?\" She shrugged. \"One thing\u0027s for sure. The Uncle Joe who used to say, \u0027Just hav e faith and everything will turn out fine\u0027 is gone.\" Yes, he is, Joe thought with a deep pang of regret. Gone forever. \"Do you miss him, Lacey?\" \"Yes and no. He was a great, easygoing guy, but he\u0027s not what we need now. And speaking of now, here comes the big question: what next?\" Good question. Joe had been thinking about that. He closed his eyes, lifted h is face to the sun, and watched the glowing red inner surface of his lids. The sun ... their greatest ally. As long as it was out, he and the parishio ners had a fighting chance. The Vichy, what remained of them, seemed cowed. A few had shown their faces in the vicinity but were quickly chased off wi thout offering even token resistance. Every so often Joe would spot one sku lking in the shadows a few blocks away, watching the church, but none ventu red close. But once the sun set, the balance would shift to the undead and their collabor ators. \"I think we should start a compound,\" he said. \"You mean, like a fort?\" \"Not so much a fort as a consolidation. Gather everyone close for mutual pr otection and pooling of resources.\" Lacey nodded. \"The Ben Franklin approach.\" \"Ben Franklin?\" \"Yeah. What he said at the signing of the Declaration of Independence: \u0027We m ust all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.\u0027 \" \"Declaration of Independence ... I guess we did that last night.\" \"Damn right. But with deeds instead of words on paper.\" \"But as for hanging together, that\u0027s the plan - and I don\u0027t mean by our necks. The living are scattered all over town now. That leaves us vulnerable to being picked off one by one. But if we use the church as a hub and bring ev erybody toward the center - \" \"Circle the wagons, in other words.\" \"Exactly. As of now we\u0027ve got the rectory, the convent, and the church itsel f. That\u0027ll house some people, but it\u0027s not enough. We need to expand.\" \"You got that right.\" By word of mouth and who knew how else, the news that someone was fightin g back had spread. A steady stream of newcomers, anxious to join the figh t, had been flowing to the church all morning. Many of them were not even Catholic. Jews, Protestants, even Muslims were showing up, wanting to kn ow how they could be part of what was happening. Joe had passed the word to welcome everyone. This was not a time for divisions. The arbitrary wal ls that had separated people in the past had to be knocked down. There co uld be only one belief system now: the living versus the undead and those who sided with them. \"There\u0027s an empty office building across the street from the back of the chur ch,\" Joe said, remembering the night he and Zev had spent there. Had it been only two nights since then? \"That should hold a lot of folks. We\u0027ll start the re.\" \"I passed a couple of furniture stores on the way here,\" Lacey said. She poin ted south. \"If I remember, they\u0027re just a few blocks that way.\" \"You\u0027re right,\" Joe said. \"I know the places.\" \"We can raid them for bedding.\" \"Great idea. Once we set that up, we\u0027ll take over the surrounding houses - assuming they\u0027re unoccupied.\" \"Pretty safe assumption,\" Lacey said. \"If the owners somehow survived, I c an\u0027t see them hanging around for long, considering what\u0027s been going down in the church.\" \"But first I want to start blocking off the surrounding streets - get old cars, line them up in the intersections. That\u0027ll fend off or at least slow down any blitzkrieg-style counterattacks.\" He felt Lacey\u0027s hand on his arm and turned to find her staring at him. \"You\u0027ve given this a lot of thought, haven\u0027t you.\" \"That\u0027s just it. I haven\u0027t. I\u0027m making it up as I go along. As I told you last night, my original intent was to hold the place for one night, say Mass, then m ove on.\" Lacey smiled. \"I was wondering what happened to that idea.\" \"It got lost in the crowd.\" Joe hadn\u0027t counted on drawing a crowd. Now that he had, what did he do wi th them? He couldn\u0027t perform the loaves-and-fishes miracle. How was he go ing to feed them? But seeing the desperate hope gleaming in their eyes th is morning, he couldn\u0027t simply walk out on them. \"So ...\" Lacey said slowly. \"Beyond a compound .. . what?\" \"I wish I knew.\" \"You realize, don\u0027t you, that we can\u0027t win.\" \"I don\u0027t realize any such thing.\" \"Hey, Unk,\" she said, her grip tightening on his arm. \"We\u0027re only a hundred people and there are millions of them. They\u0027ve got Europe, the Middle East, India, and most of Asia.\" \"But they haven\u0027t got the U.S. They hold the East Coast but the rest of the cou ntry is still alive.\" \"How can you be sure?\" \"I was talking to one of the newcomers this morning. His name\u0027s Gerald Vanc e and he\u0027s got a battery-powered shortwave radio. He told me he\u0027s been talk ing to people all over the country. Philadelphia\u0027s gone but Harrisburg and Pittsburgh have only seen an occasional vampire. Same with Rochester. Atlan ta fell but Alabama\u0027s fine. The Midwest and the West Coast are still in the hands of the living. So you see, it\u0027s not over.\" Lacey looked away. \"After seeing what\u0027s happened to the rest of the world, yo u could argue that it\u0027s just a matter of time.\" Joe lowered his voice. \"I\u0027d appreciate it if you wouldn\u0027t talk like that. Last night was the first good thing that\u0027s happened to these people in a long time, so if you don\u0027t mind ...\" Lacey held up a hand. \"Okay. \u0027Never is heard a discouraging word.\u0027 But if t hat\u0027s true about the rest of the country, then instead of staying here mayb e we should be thinking about throwing a convoy together and heading west.\" Joe shook his head. He\u0027d already thought of that. \"We\u0027re being watched. We start to assemble dozens of cars, they\u0027ll know what we\u0027re planning. They\u0027ll be waiting for us. We\u0027ll be sitting ducks on the ro ad.\" He\u0027d seen it play out in his mind\u0027s eye. He\u0027d envisioned a line of cars raci ng down Route 70 at dawn. But he\u0027d also envisioned a Vichy roadblock, gunfir e, bloodshed, disabled cars, the convoy stalled, blocked fore and aft, the s un going down, and then... massacre. \"We\u0027ve got a better chance here. I told Vance to get on his radio and spread the word of what we\u0027re doing here. Maybe it will spur others to do the same. Right now we\u0027ve set a fire. If we remain the only bonfire, I agree: we\u0027re doomed. But if we can start a trend, inspire a hundred, a thousand fires alo ng the coast, we\u0027ll no longer be the center of attention. We might have a ch ance.\" Lacey was nodding. \"And if the rest of the country gets the message that there is hope, that resistance is not futile ...\" She grinned and raised her fist. \"I always wanted to be a revolutionary.\" \"Well, you\u0027re going to get your wish.\" Joe yawned. When was the last time h e\u0027d slept? \"My wish is for forty winks.\" \"Why don\u0027t you bed down for a while in the rectory? You catch your forty wh ile I take some people over to that office building and check it out. We\u0027ll see how we can divide it up for living arrangements.\" Joe stared at her. Where did she get her energy? \"Aren\u0027t you tired?\" She shrugged. \"I\u0027ve never needed much sleep. Besides, I had a nap.\" \"When?\" She smiled. \"While you were saying Mass.\" Joe sighed. \"When are you going to face facts and admit - ?\" \"Hush.\" She put a finger to her lips. \"I\u0027m still not on board, but we\u0027ll argu e about this some other time. Right now, there\u0027s too much work to do.\" Joe watched her stride off, thinking that whoever said there are no atheists in foxholes obviously hadn\u0027t met Lacey. LACEY . . . Lacey gazed out the window at the lengthening shadows and rubbed her bur ning eyes. Tired. She hadn\u0027t found time for another nap yet. All she needed was twenty minutes and she\u0027d be good for hours more of activity. Her uncle and the rest were in the process of working out a sleep schedule, assigning shifts. Some of them were going to have to live undead style, slee ping in the day, up all night, while others would keep a more normal schedul e. Lacey figured she\u0027d volunteer for the undead shift since she tended to be a night person anyway. She turned away from the window and checked out the room behind her. The de sks had been pushed into a corner and a mattress and box spring placed in t he center of the floor. Not fancy but functional, and a helluva lot more co mfortable than trying to sleep on the church\u0027s stone floor. She stretched her aching muscles. A good workout today, driving pickup truc ks to the furniture stores, hauling bedding back, and lugging it up the ste ps to the upper floors. Toward the end of the afternoon she would have give n anything for a generator to power up the elevator. Back to the window for another look at the grand old Victorian next door. Ja ney had been so into Victorians, dragging Lacey around the city, pointing ou t this Second Empire and that Italianate until she\u0027d caught the bug too. The y\u0027d planned someday to come down to Asbury Park, buy a place like the three-story affair next door and renovate it, dress it up like those fabulous pain ted ladies they\u0027d salivated over on their trip to San Francisco last year. Lacey felt a lump grow in her throat. Janey... they\u0027d had such good times t ogether ... the best years of her life. She missed her. Losing her had left an cavity where she\u0027d once had a heart. Where are you, Janey? What did they do to you? Lacey knew in that instant which building she wanted added next to Uncle Joe\u0027s \"compound.\" Why not suggest it to him now? She ducked into the hall and started down the stairwell, only to have to bac k up to allow a couple of the parish men to pass with a queen-size mattress. \"I\u0027m heading over to the church to see Father Joe,\" she told them. \"Give us a minute and I\u0027ll escort you back,\" said a red-faced, heavyset man in a plaid shirt. Lacey waved him off. \"Don\u0027t be silly. It\u0027s a hundred feet away. And the stree t\u0027s blocked.\" Probably just wants a break from all the lifting and hauling, she thought as she stepped outside. She checked up and down the street. Nothing moving. No one in sight. As she started across the street she glanced again at the old house and figur ed, why not check it out first? If it wasn\u0027t habitable - say, a big hole in the roof or something like that - why waste her time? But she wasn\u0027t going in there alone. No way. She\u0027d seen enough horror mov ies to know you don\u0027t go into empty houses alone when there are bad guys about. She looked around, saw a short, muscular guy in a sleeveless T-shirt crossi ng the street, heading from the church toward the office building. What was his name? Enrico. Yeah, that was it. \"Hey, Enrico. Want to help me check out this place next door? See if we ca n move people in there?\" \"Sure,\" he said, grinning. \"Let\u0027s go.\" She waited for him to catch up, then together they headed for the front ste ps and climbed onto the porch. She tried the door, hoping it was unlocked - s he hated the thought of breaking one of those old windows to get in - and smi led as the latch yielded to the pressure of her thumb. All right! Enrico hung in the living room while Lacey hurried through the cool, dark, silent interior. The decor was not authentically Victorian - nowhere near c ramped and cluttered enough - but the place hadn\u0027t been vandalized. The two upper floors held five small bedrooms and one larger master bedroom, all f urnished with beds and dressers. The couch in the first-floor sun room cou ld sleep another, once all the dead house plants were removed. Perfect, she thought, feeling the best she had all day. This is a definite kee per. And I\u0027ve got first dibs on the master bedroom. She came down the main staircase - the house had a rear servants\u0027 stairway as well, running to and from the kitchen - and found the living room empty. \"Enrico?\" Maybe he\u0027d done a little exploring on his own. She headed for the kitchen an d stopped cold when she saw a pair of feet jutting toes-up from behind a cou nter. She wanted to run but knew she had to check. She hurried forward, took a look at the kitchen carving knife jutting from Enrico\u0027s bloody chest, at his dead, glazed eyes staring at the ceiling, then spun and ran. She didn\u0027t head for the front door. Instead she sprang for the French doors and leaped onto the verandah. There she ran into three waiting Vichy and h ad no time to react before something cracked against her skull, sending lig htning bolts through her suddenly darkening vision. She lashed out with her booted foot but struck only air, and then another blow to her head sent he r down. She had flashes of faces, one clean-shaven, one bearded, one with braided hair, snatches of voices . . . \"Got one!\"... \"Hey, she\u0027s fine! She\u0027s really fine!\" A feeling of being carried, then an impact as she was tossed into the rear of a van, the van starting to move, then more voices... \"We get major points for this - major!\"... \"Man, she\u0027s so fine! Shame to haf ta give her to the bloodsuckers.\"... \"Ay, yo, they only said they wanted a live one. Didn\u0027t say nothin \u0027bout havin to be a virgin, know\u0027m sayin?\" Laughter. \"Right! Fuckin-ay right!\" And then the feeling of her clothes being torn from her body . . . CAROLE . . . Sister Carole watched a beat-up old van race along the street. She couldn\u0027t see who was driving but it was coming from the direction of St. Anthony\u0027s. St. Anthony\u0027s... how she\u0027d wanted to step inside when she\u0027d passed by this morning. She\u0027d heard the voices drifting through the open front doors, respo nding to Father Joe during Mass, and they\u0027d tugged her up the steps to partic ipate and ... to see Father Joe\u0027s face once more. But she couldn\u0027t allow it. She was unworthy... too unworthy. She\u0027d seen the stains on the steps - blood and fouler substances - and had as ked one of the armed men guarding the front about them. He\u0027d told her abo ut what had happened during the night, how Father Palmeri and other undea d had been routed and killed along with their living helpers, how the chu rch was now a holy place again. Carole had walked on with her heart singing. Maybe what she\u0027d been doing w as not all for naught. Maybe there was a Divine Plan and she was part of i t. Then again, maybe not. Most likely not. The song in her heart had gasped and died. And so she\u0027d spent most of the rest of the day working around the house. She figured it was only a matter of time before she was caught and wanted t o be ready when the undead or their cowboys came for her. \"I wish they\u0027d come for you NOW, Carole. Then this shame, this monstro us sinfulness would he over and you\u0027d get what you DESERVE!\" \"That makes two of us,\" Sister Carole said. She didn\u0027t want to go out again tonight but knew she had to. Her only solace was the certainty that sooner or later it going to end - for he r. She set a few more wires, ran a few more strings, then headed up to the bedr oom to change into her padded bra, her red blouse, her black leather skirt. \"Not again! When is it going to END, Carole? When is this going to STOP?\" \"When they\u0027re all dead and gone,\" Sister Carole said aloud to the stranger in the bedroom mirror. \"Or when I am. Whichever comes first.\" GREGOR... Gregor frowned as he smeared makeup on his face to hide his pallor. He hoped it looked all right. Since he couldn\u0027t use a mirror he had to go by feel. I t would have made more sense to have one of his get apply it, but he wanted to keep his plan to himself. He sprayed himself with Obsession cologne. The living said the undead carr ied an unmistakable odor. He couldn\u0027t detect it himself, but this should m ask it. He rose and looked down at himself. A long-sleeved work shirt, scr uffy jeans, a crescent-on-a-chain earring, and now, a passably - he hoped - ru ddy complexion. \"Hey there,\" he said in the drawl he\u0027d been practicing since sundown, hopin g to disguise his own accent with another. \"Ahm new in these here parts.\" He slipped a cowboy hat onto his head to complete the picture. A good enough picture, he hoped, to decoy these vigilantes into picking on him as their next cowboy victim. Gregor smiled, baring his teeth. Then they\u0027d be in for a surprise. He could have sent someone else, could have sent out a number of decoys, bu t he wanted this hunt for himself. After all, Franco had his eye on the sit uation, and that mandated bold and extraordinary measures. Gregor needed to prove without a doubt that the vigilantes were separate from the insurgent s in the church. He stepped over the drained, beheaded corpse of the old man who\u0027d been br ought to him earlier - what had happened to all the young catde? - and checke d the map one last time. He\u0027d marked all six places where the dead cowboy s had been found. The X\u0027s formed a rough circle. Gregor\u0027s plan was to wan der the streets within that circle. Alone. An hour ago he\u0027d sent his get-guards upstairs to the main floor of the synag ogue, telling them he wanted to sup alone and be left undisturbed here in th e basement while he planned the night\u0027s sortie. Now he crept up the steps an d let himself out a side door and into the dark. Gregor took a deep, shuddering breath of the night air. Too long since he\u0027d d one this. Not since he\u0027d migrated out of Eastern Europe with the others. It f elt wonderful to be on the hunt again. JOE . . . Joe realized with a start that he hadn\u0027t seen Lacey since this morning. \"Has anybody seen my niece?\" he said to a group of men standing guard on t he front steps. \"Niece?\" one of them said, a big black man with gray stubble on his cheeks. \"I didn\u0027t know you had one. What\u0027s she look like, Father?\" \"Dark hair, tattoo on her arm about here, and she\u0027s - \" \"Sure,\" said another fellow. He jerked a thumb over his shoulder. \"She was w ith us back there across the street in the office building most of the day. Some kinda worker, that girl.\" \"That she is,\" Joe said, trying not to sound too obviously proud. \"But when d id you last see her? \" \"Late afternoon,\" said a big, red-faced man. \"Said she was coming back her e to see you about something.\" A jolt of alarm lanced though Joe. \"I haven\u0027t seen her. She never got to me!\" He tore back into the church, scanning expectant faces as he hurried throug h the nave - expectant because he was supposed to start saying evening Mass j ust about now. He ducked through the sanctuary and into the sacristy where he found Carl, getting ready for his altar boy duties. \"Carl! Have you seen Lacey?\" He shook his head. \"No, Fadda. Something wrong?\" \"She\u0027s missing. Gone.\" Joe\u0027s gut crawled. \"Get your gun and a couple of the men. We\u0027ve got to find her.\" \"But what about Mass?\" \"Forget about that. Lacey comes first.\" \"Y\u0027gotta say Mass, Fadda. Everyone\u0027s out there waiting for you.\" He stepped to the door and looked out into the nave. \"Let\u0027s do this: I\u0027ll tell some of the non-Catholic guys to look for her during Mass. They can look just as goo d as us. They\u0027ll find her. Chances are she\u0027s probably conked out in the conv ent or rectory catching up on her sleep.\" Joe prayed that was true. It seemed logical. Lacey could take care of herse lf, probably better than most of the men. She\u0027d made it all the way down he re from New York on her own, hadn\u0027t she? Still. . . not knowing where she was gnawed at him. GREGOR . . . Where are you? Gregor wanted to shout. I\u0027m right here in your kill zone. Come and get me! He had been walking these empty streets for what seemed like hours. It had n\u0027t been nearly that long, but his gnawing impatience made it feel that wa y. He\u0027d seen no one, living or undead. He fought the discouragement he sen sed creeping up on him, preparing to pounce on his back. He would not give up. He refused to return empty handed again. He was wondering if perhaps he should set himself up as bait in another ar ea when he heard a woman\u0027s voice call from the shadows. \"Hey, mister. Got any food?\" He jumped, not having to fake his surprise. How had she sneaked up on him l ike that? She was downwind, he realized, and had been hiding behind a thick tree trunk. Still, he should have sensed her presence. His senses were on full alert now. Were the prey taking the bait? Was this woman bait herself, placed here to lure an unsuspecting cowboy into a trap? He saw her clearly - a young woman in provocative clothes. Not that it prov oked him. Only one thing could do that, and it wasn\u0027t made of cloth. It w as red and warm and flowed and spurted. Gregor made a show of squinting into the darkness. No sense in giving his night vision away and scaring off her backup - if indeed she had backup. Hesensed no other living human nearby. \"Come on out where ah can see you, honey,\" he said, remembering to add th e drawl. The cow stepped out of the shadows into the moonlight. \"My, my, you sure are a purty one. What you doin out here alone?\" \"L-looking for some food. You got any you can spare?\" \"I might. What\u0027s in it for me?\" Didn\u0027t want to sound too anxious. \"What do you think?\" the woman said. Gregor nodded. \"I guess that\u0027s fair. Where do we make the trade?\" He felt his excitement fading. This was sounding more and more like some t awdry little sex-for-food deal. Not at all what he was looking for. Where were those vigilantes? Damn them! \"Anywhere you want,\" the cow said. \"I just have to check on my little girl fir st.\" Little girl? That renewed Gregor\u0027s interest. If it were true, well, he hadn\u0027t had really young blood in too long. And if it was a lie to entice some hap less cowboy looking to earn some bonus points, that was fine too. That was w hy he was here. \"I\u0027ll follow you home, then we\u0027ll go to my place.\" Her house was only a block and a half away. Gregor felt his tension mount as she led him up the front steps to the door. He wouldn\u0027t be able to cross the threshold uninvited. If he hesitated too long, she\u0027d guess the truth. He waited until she\u0027d opened the door. As soon as she stepped inside he said, \"This ain\u0027t some kinda trap, is it?\" She turned and faced him. \"What do you mean?\" \"Well, guys like me been dyin left and right lately. I don\u0027t wanna step throu gh that door and get jumped.\" \"Stop being silly and come in.\" Gregor stifled a laugh as he stepped forward. Stupid cow. She was already heading for the stairs when he crossed the threshold. \"Let me just take a quick peek,\" she said as she bounded up the steps, \"and then we can get going.\" Gregor watched her go, then closed his eyes, trying to sense other living p resences. He found none. His disappointment mounted. This cow wasn\u0027t connec ted to the vigilantes. She was here alone. Wait. Alone? What about the daughter she\u0027d mentioned? Why didn\u0027t he sens e her? Curious, Gregor moved toward the stairs. OLIVIA . . . Olivia stared at the woman captured near the church and wanted to scream. I f they weren\u0027t so short of serfs she would have bled out the three who\u0027d br ought her here. Look at her. Crumbled in the corner like a discarded mannequin. Naked, bat tered, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina, and rectum. And worst of all, unconscious. How could she get any information from this cow if she coul dn\u0027t speak? Had they beaten her into a coma? What if she never woke up? Ol ivia would then have to wait until they picked up another. And that would be much harder now because the church fold would be watching for it. This is what you get when you have to depend on scum. And what do you get when you depend on an egomaniac like Franco? Just a s much. Maybe less. Wasn\u0027t anything going to go right down here in this wasted little section of t he coast? Word had come from New York that Franco was refusing her request for a co ntingent of ferals and more experienced serfs. Franco was going to handle this matter himself, in his own way, whatever that meant. What it meant was a slap in the face not just to Gregor, but her as well. Damn him. Damn them all. If just once she could - One of her get-guards returned then with the bucket of water she\u0027d ordered. Olivia pointed to the cow on the floor. \"Pour it on her. See if that wakes her.\" The guard did as he was bid. The cow stirred and shivered but didn\u0027t open he r eyes. \"Damn! Get more!\" Just then one of the serfs, a tawdry blond woman, tried to step through the Post Office door. Olivia\u0027s guards restrained her. \"That\u0027s her!\" the woman screamed. A deep purple bruise ringed her left eye. \"That\u0027s the one who suckered me! Let me at her! Just five minutes!\" \"Get her out of here,\" Olivia said. \"No!\" the woman shrilled as she was shoved back into the night. \"I got a sco re to settle with her. She owes me!\" \"Out!\" Olivia screamed. With help like that, she thought, who needs enemies? How we came this far I\u0027ll never know. Another commotion at the door. \"If it\u0027s that serf cow again, slit her throat!\" \"It\u0027s Gregor\u0027s get,\" one of her guards said. \"All his guards.\" \"What does he want now? He\u0027s supposed to be hunting his beloved vigilante s.\" Her guard looked puzzled. \"He\u0027s not with them.\" Olivia stiffened with shock. Gregor\u0027s get without Gregor? What on - ? And then she smiled. Had Gregor gone off and done something foolish? Som ething reckless? Oh, she hoped so. It would look all the worse for him w hen he showed up empty handed again. \"By all means, send them in. But keep close watch on them.\" CAROLE . . . As Sister Carole changed out of her slutty clothes she had a feeling somethin g was wrong. She couldn\u0027t put her finger on it, but she sensed something stra nge about this one. He wore the earring, he\u0027d reacted just the way all the ot hers had, but he\u0027d been stand-offish, keeping his distance, as if afraid to g et too close. That bothered her. Could there be such a thing as a shy collabo rator? The ones she\u0027d met so far had been anything but. God willing, she thought, in a few moments it would be over. She\u0027d followed her usual routine, dashing upstairs, being sure to take the ste ps two at a time so it wouldn\u0027t look strange hopping over the first. Now she began rubbing off her makeup, all the while listening for the clank of the bear trap when it was tripped. Finally it came and she winced as she always did, anticipating the shrill, a wful cries of pain. But none came. She rushed to the landing and looked down. There she saw the cowboy ripping the restraining chain free from its nail, then reaching down and opening the jaws of the trap with his bare hands. With her heart pounding a sudden mad tattoo in her chest, Sister Carole real ized then that she\u0027d made a terrible mistake. She\u0027d expected to be caught so me day, but not like this. She wasn\u0027t prepared for one of them. \"Now you\u0027ve done it, Carole! Now you\u0027ve really DONE IT!\" Shaking, panting with fear, Sister Carole dashed back to the bedroom and f ollowed the emergency route she\u0027d prepared. GREGOR . . . Gregor inspected the dried blood on the teeth of the trap. Obviously it had b een used before. So this was how they did it. Clever. And nasty. He rubbed the already healing wound on his lower leg. The trap had hurt, st artled him more than anything else, but no real harm done. He straightened, kicked the trap into the opening beneath the faux step, and looked around. Where were the rest of the petty revolutionaries? There had to be more than this lone woman. Or perhaps not. The empty feel of the house persisted. One woman doing all this damage? Gregor could not believe it. And neither would Olivia. There had to be more to this. He headed upstairs, gliding this time, barely touching the steps. Another trap would slow him. He spotted the rope ladder dangling over the win-dows ill as soon as he entered the bedroom. He darted to the window and leaped through the opening. He landed lightly on the overgrown lawn and sniffed t he air. She wasn\u0027t far - He heard running footsteps, a sudden loud rustle, and saw a leafy branch fl ashing toward him. Gregor felt something hit his chest, pierce it, and knoc k him back. He grunted with the pain, staggered a few steps, then looked do wn. Three metal tines protruded from his sternum. The cow had tied back a sapling, fixed the end of a pitchfork to it, and cu t it free when he\u0027d descended from the window. Crude but deadly - if he\u0027d bee n human. He yanked the tines free and tossed them aside. Around the rear of the house he heard a door slam. She\u0027d gone back inside. Obviously she wanted him to follow. But Gregor de cided to enter his own way. He backed away a few steps, then ran and hurl ed himself through the dining room window. The shattered glass settled. Dark. Quiet. She was here inside. He sensed he r but couldn\u0027t pinpoint her location. Not yet. Only a matter of time - a very short time - before he found her. He was making his move toward the rear roo ms of the house when a bell shattered the silence, startling him. He stared incredulously at the source of the noise. The telephone? But how? The first things his nightbrothers had destroyed were the communication networks. Without thinking, he reached out to it - a reflex from days gone b y. The phone exploded as soon as he lifted the receiver. The blast knocked him against the far wall, smashing him into the beveled gla ss of the china cabinet. Again, just as with last night\u0027s explosion, he was b linded by the flash. But this time he was hurt as well. His hand... agony he couldn\u0027t remember ever feeling pain like this. Blind and helpless ... if s he had accomplices, he was at their mercy now. But no one attacked him, and soon he could see again. \"My hand!\" he groaned when he saw the ragged stump of his right wrist. Th e pain was fading, but his hand was gone. It would regenerate in time but - He had to get out of here and find help before she did something else to him. He didn\u0027t care if it made him look like a fool, this woman was dangerous! Gregor staggered to his feet and started for the door. Once he was outside in t he night air he\u0027d feel better, he\u0027d regain some of his strength. CAROLE . . . In the basement Sister Carole huddled under the mattress and stretched her a rm upward. Her fingers found a string that ran the length of the basement to a hole in one of the floorboards above, ran through that hole and into the pantry in the main hall where it was tied to the handle of an empty teacup t hat sat on the edge of the bottom shelf. She tugged on the string and the te acup fell. Sister Carole heard it shatter and snuggled deeper under her matt ress. GREGOR . . . What? Gregor spun at the noise. There. Behind that door. She was hiding in that cl oset. She\u0027d knocked something off a shelf in there. He\u0027d heard her. He had h er now. Gregor knew he was hurt - maimed - but even with one hand he could easily han dle a dozen cattle like her. He didn\u0027t want to wait, didn\u0027t want to go ba ck to Olivia without something to show for the night. And the cow was so close now. Bight behind that door. He reached out with his good hand and yanked it open. Gregor saw everything with crystal clarity then, and understood everything as it happened. He saw the string attached to the inside of the door, saw it tighten and pul l the little wedge of wood from between the jaws of the clothespin that was tacked to the third shelf. He saw the two wires - one wrapped around the upper jaw and leading back to a dry cell battery, the other wrapped around the lo wer and leading to a row of wax-coated cylinders standing on that third shel f like a collection of lumpy, squat candles with firecracker-thick wicks. As the wired jaws of the clothespin snapped closed, he saw a tiny spark leap t he narrowing gap. Gregor\u0027s universe exploded. LACEY . . . Lacey had been conscious for a while but kept her eyes closed, daring every so often to split her lids for a peek. It had taken all her reserve to keep from screaming when that bloodsucker had splashed a bucket of water on her. At least they\u0027d kept that Vichy broad, the one from under the boardwalk, fro m getting to her. Lacey didn\u0027t think she could handle any more pain. She hurt. .. oh, how she hurt. Everywhere. In places and in ways she\u0027d nev er imagined she could hurt. She didn\u0027t remember the details, but she knew those three Vichy must have worked her over good. Raped her every possible way. Lacey ground her teeth. Goddamn human animals ... male human animals, us ing their dicks as weapons. Then she remembered Enrico. They\u0027d used a knife on him. Maybe he was the lucky one. He\u0027d gone quickly. She\u0027d been brought here to be someone\u0027s mea l. After she was drained they\u0027d rip off her head and toss her body on a p ile somewhere to rot. But that was better than becoming one of them. But why were they trying to wake her? They didn\u0027t need her conscious to dra in her blood. Did they have another use for her in mind? Like using her to find out what was going on inside the church? A shiver ran through her. She was freezing here on this puddled marble floo r and couldn\u0027t keep her limbs from quaking. Had anybody seen? She split her lids and took a peek. Not much light. Only a few candles sputtering but it was enough to make ou t faces. The female vampire with the big hair had been ranting in French b efore, but now she stood silent with her six armed attendants. Guards? Lac ey had heard that some of the higher-up undead traveled around with what l ooked like bodyguards, but this was the first time she\u0027d seen it. Why did the undead think they needed guards, especially when everyone else around was undead? Four new undead males wearing machetes and pistols entered. They addresse d the female as Olivia and spoke in English. \" \u0027Ave you seen Gregor, Olivia?\" said a dark-haired guard with a British accen t. He looked dirty, all in black, his shirtfront crusted with old blood. Olivia replied in English. \"Not since before sunrise.\" A small smile played about her lips. \"Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve misplaced him.\" \"Bloody bastard gave us the slip. We found makeup and cologne in his quarter s. \u0027E\u0027s gone out on \u0027is own to find those vigilantes.\" Vigilantes? Lacey thought. This was interesting. She hadn\u0027t heard anything about vigilantes. But then, she\u0027d only arrived in town yesterday. Who was this Gregor and why was he hunting them? \"That seems rather reckless, don\u0027t you think?\" Olivia said. The Brit snarled at her. \"I\u0027m sure \u0027e\u0027d never be out there if you \u0027adn\u0027t driven\u0027im to it. We were \u0027oping \u0027e\u0027d come to see you first and we could intercept \u0027i m \u0027ere, but I see we\u0027re in the wrong place.\" \"You certainly are.\" \"Look, Olivia,\" the Brit said, his tone becoming conciliatory. \"If you\u0027ve any idea where \u0027e might be, please tell us. We\u0027ve got to find \u0027im. \u0027E could be in grave danger.\" Lacey was struck by the concern in the Brit\u0027s voice. The undead supposedly cared about only one thing: blood. But the Brit seemed genuinely worried about this Gregor. Lots more than Olivia. \"Well, if he is, it\u0027s his own doing.\" The Brit snarled again. \"If anything happens to Gregor ...\" \"You\u0027ll be the first to know.\" She laughed, showing her sharp teeth. \"Bitch!\" the Brit said and reached for the handle of his machete. Olivia\u0027s guards closed around her, reaching for their own. And then a thun derous boom rattled the windows and shook the floor beneath Lacey. As the sound of the blast faded, the Brit and the three other undead who\u0027d a rrived with him cried out and clutched their chests. One by one they dropped to their knees. Olivia\u0027s smile had vanished, replaced by a look of horror. Her voice rose in pitch, somewhere between a shout and a wail, as she rattled off a barrage o f French too rapid for Lacey to follow. Lacey recognized the name \"Gregor\" b ut that was it. Her guards looked as terrified as she as they encircled her, facing outwar d, machetes and pistols drawn. They were speaking French too, and again Gr egor was mentioned. What were they saying? Lacey wished now she\u0027d taken French instead of Sp anish. The Brit\u0027s friends lay writhing, kicking, and gasping on their backs and bellie s, but he was still on his knees, glaring at Olivia. \"You!\" His voice was faint, and sounded as if someone were strangling him. \"You did this! You\u0027re responsible!\" He began a faltering crawl toward her. \"Keep him away!\" Olivia said. The Brit pulled his machete from his belt and tried to use it as a crutch to re gain his feet. \"I\u0027ll see you - \" One of Olivia\u0027s guards stepped forward then and, holding his machete like a baseball bat, took a two-handed swing. The blade sliced through the Brit\u0027s n eck with an indescribable tearing sound, sending the head flying. But no gou t of blood sprayed the room as the body flopped forward onto its chest and l ay still next to the other three fallen undead, now equally still. And the head ... the head rolled toward Lacey\u0027s face. She shut her eyes, braci ng herself if it rolled against her. She couldn\u0027t allow herself to move, could n\u0027t give herself away, no matter what. What was happening here? Undead dropping dead, fighting and killing each other. What the hell was going on? It had something to do with someone named Gregor, but what? Lacey opened her eyes again and stifled a gasp as she found herself almost n ose to nose with the Brit. His eyelids blinked and his lips were moving, as if he was trying to tell her something. Bile rose in Lacey\u0027s throat and she squeezed her eyes shut again. GREGOR . . . I\u0027m awake! Gregor thought. I survived! He didn\u0027t know how long it had been since the blast. A few minutes? A few h ours? It couldn\u0027t have been too long - it was still night. He could see the m oonlight through the huge hole that had been ripped in the wall. He tried to move but could not. In fact, he couldn\u0027t feel anything. Anythin g. But he could hear. And he heard someone picking through the rubble towar d him. He tried to turn his head but could not. Who was there? One of his o wn kind - please let it be one of his own kind. When he saw the flashlight beam he knew it was one of the living. He began to despair. He was utterly helpless here. What had that explosion done to him? As the light came closer, he saw that it was the woman, the she-devil. She ap peared to be unscathed .. . And she wore the headpiece of a nun. She shone the beam in his face and he blinked. \"Dear sweet Jesus!\" she said, her voice hushed with awe. \"You\u0027re not dead y et? Even in this condition?\" He tried to tell her how she would pay for this, how she would suffer the to rtures of the damned and beg for death, but his jaw wasn\u0027t working right, an d he had no voice. \"So what are we going to do with you, Mister Vampire?\" she said. \"Your frie nds might show up and find a way to fix you up. Not that I can see how that\u0027d be possible, but I wouldn\u0027t put anything past you vipers.\" What was she saying? What did she mean? What had happened to him? \"If I had a good supply of holy water I could pour it over you, but I want to conserve what I\u0027ve got.\" She was quiet a moment, then turned and walked off. Had she decided to lea ve him here? He hoped so. At least that way he had a chance. But if she wanted to kill him, why hadn\u0027t she said anything about driving a s take through his heart? He tried to move but his body wouldn\u0027t respond. Somehow the blast had paral yzed him. He noticed his vision growing dim, his sense of hearing fading. What was happening? He felt as if he might be drifting toward true death ... No! That that couldn\u0027t be. He was only paralyzed. Through his misting vision Gregor saw her coming back. Her hands were bright yellow. How? Why? \"The only thing I can think of doing is to set you on the east end of the porc h and let the sun finish you.\" No! Please! Not that. The woman rested the flashlight on a broken timber and reached for his fac e. He saw now that she wore yellow rubber gloves. He tried to cringe away, but again - no response from his body. She grabbed him by his hair and . .. lifted him. How could she be so strong? Vertigo spun him around as she l ooked him in the face. \"You can still see, can\u0027t you? Maybe you\u0027d better take a look at yourself.\" Vertigo again as she twisted his head around, and then he saw the hallway, or what was left of it. Mass destruction... shattered timbers, the stairs blow n away, and . . . Pieces of his body - his arms and legs torn and scattered, his torso twisted a nd eviscerated, his intestines stretched and ripped, internal organs reduced to large, unrecognizable smears. As his vision faded to black in the final fall toward true death, Gregor wishe d his lungs were still attached. So he could scream. Just once. LACEY . . . A stink filled Lacey\u0027s nostrils as she noticed that Olivia\u0027s rapid-fire Fre nch seemed to be fading away. She dared another look. The Brit\u0027s face was s lack now and the flesh was starting to decompose. She lifted her head to lo ok beyond him and saw Olivia and her crew backing into a stairwell, heading down to what Lacey assumed was the basement. As soon as the door closed behind them, Lacey raised her head further and looked around. Except for the bodies of the four dead vampires, she was al one. She\u0027d been forgotten. But for how long? She struggled to rise, groaning with the pain in her joints and muscles, but especially in her pelvis. She slipped on the wet floor and banged her elbow a s she went down. She tried again, clinging to the wall, using it to steady he rself as the room spun about her. Clenching her teeth against a wave of nause a, she rose to her feet and hugged the wall. When the room steadied, she looked down at her bloody, naked body and wan ted to retch. What did they do to her? She\u0027d deal with that later. Right now she had to get out of here and back t o the church. But where was here} She knew from the signs on the wall that she was in a Post Office. But how did she find the church once she got out? First things first, she told herself. Get out of this undead nest, then worry about finding your way back. Still holding the wall, she edged toward the doors. She looked longingly at t he clothes on the corpses of the dead vampires, but their rot was already see ping through the fabric. She\u0027d rather be naked. She spotted a clock on the wall. It read 3:12. It couldn\u0027t be that late. Then she noticed the second hand was frozen at the half-minute mark. An electric clock, and the power had been off for a long, long time. Lacey pushed through the doors and the cool night air hit her, sending a co ld tremor through her body. She kept moving, padding across the moonlit con crete to the surrounding shadows. She needed some clothes, and not just for warmth; couldn\u0027t turn up in front of the people in the church, especially her Uncle Joe, looking like this. She had to find a house, go through one o f the closets - \"It\u0027s you!\" cried a voice behind her. \"How did you get away?\" Lacey turned and stared at the figure advancing toward her from the other si de of the street. The bottle blonde from the boardwalk, dressed in lowrider jeans and a cutaway denim jacket. Her boots thudded on the pavement. Lacey s aw a flash in her right hand, heard a clink, and realized she\u0027d just flipped open a knife. The stainless steel blade gleamed in the moonlight. Lacey said nothing. Her brain seemed sluggish. All she could think was, Not now ... I can\u0027t handle this now. \"Guess it doesn\u0027t matter how,\" the Vichy woman said with a throaty laugh as she reached the grass and kept coming. \"I\u0027m just glad you did. Because we got a score to settle, you and me.\" Lacey tried to remember some of the defense moves she\u0027d learned in her mar tial arts classes and couldn\u0027t come up with one. So she started backing aw ay. \"You can run but you can\u0027t hide,\" the blonde sing-songed. \"I don\u0027t care how much they want you alive, you ain\u0027t walkin away this time.\" She was closing in. Lacey held up her hands. \"No, wait...\" \"No waiting. Looks like a few of my friends had a party with you, now it\u0027s m y turn. I\u0027m gonna cut you, girl... cut you good!\" With that the blonde lunged forward with a vicious, face-high slash, and Lacey found her limbs responding on their own. She didn\u0027t need to remember the moves. Hour upon hour of practice had programmed them into her nervous system. Her right leg shot back and stiffened, her left knee bent, her ha nds darted forward, grabbing the blonde\u0027s knife arm at the wrist and elbow, pushing it aside, twisting it, using the woman\u0027s own weight and momentum against her to bring her down. Her Vichy earring flashed near Lacey\u0027s face and sudden visions of similar e arrings dangling over her while her three captors - Rage detonated in Lacey. Gritting her teeth she gave an extra twist to the falling woman\u0027s arm and was rewarded by a scream of pain as bones ground to gether, ligaments and tendons stretched, snapped. The woman screamed again, louder. She\u0027d be drawing a crowd soon. Lacey\u0027s hand flashed forward, landi ng a two-knuckle punch on her larynx. With a crunch of cartilage the scream ing cut off, replaced by strangled noises as the blonde began to kick and w rithe, clutching at her throat with her still-functioning left hand. Lacey picked up the knife from the grass and stepped back, looking around. Was anyone else coming after her? She and the blonde were alone in the sh adows. She watched her struggles, waiting for them to run their course. \"So,\" Lacey said. \"You were gonna cut me, huh? Cut me good. I don\u0027t think so.\" She checked the knife blade: tanto shaped with the front half of the cuttin g edge beveled and the rear half saw-toothed. Wicked. If Ms. Vichy had had her way, this blade would be jutting from Lacey\u0027s chest about now. The choking sounds faded, the kicking and writhing ebbed to twisting and twi tching. With a final spasm the hand clutching at her throat fell away and sh e lay limp and still. Lacey waited another minute, then dropped to her knees beside the dead wom an. Mastering her revulsion, she began unbuttoning her cutaway top . . . CAROLE . . . Sister Carole trudged through the inky blackness along the street, hugging t he curb, hurrying through the moonlit sections between the shadows of the tr ees, towing her red wagon behind her. She\u0027d loaded it with her Bible, her ro sary, her holy water, the blasting caps, her few remaining bombs, and other essentials. \"You\u0027re looking for ANOTHER place? And I suppose you\u0027ll be starting up t his same awful sinfulness again, won\u0027t you?\" \"I suppose I will,\" Sister Carole said aloud to the night. \"Hello?\" said a woman\u0027s voice from the darkness ahead. \"Is someone there?\" Carole froze, her hand darting into the pants pocket of her warm-up, finding the electric switch, flipping the cover, placing her thumb on the button. Wires ran from the button through a hole in the pocket to the battery and the cylindrical charge taped to her upper abdomen. God forgive her, but she would not be taken alive. She held her silence, barely breathing, waiting. She sensed movement in th e shadows ahead, and then a young woman stepped into a moonlight-dappled s ection of the sidewalk. She held an automatic pistol in each hand. \"I don\u0027t want trouble,\" the woman said. \"I just want to know how to get bac k to St. Anthony\u0027s Church.\" Carole looked around, wary. Were others lurking in the shadows? \"I think you already know the way,\" Carole said. \"No, really, I don\u0027t.\" Carole eyed her spiky hair. \"Don\u0027t try to fool me. You work for them.\" \"I don\u0027t, I swear.\" A plaintive note in the woman\u0027s voice struck Carole. \"You dress like one\" - although this one\u0027s clothes did not fit her well - \"and you\u0027re armed.\" \"The clothes are stolen. So are the guns. I\u0027ve already been attacked twice tod ay. It\u0027s not going to happen again.\" Again, the ring of truth. Carole squinted through the shadows. This woman d id look battered. \"Look,\" the woman said. \"I don\u0027t want to hurt you and you don\u0027t seem to wan t to hurt me, so can you just point me toward the church and we\u0027ll go our s eparate ways.\" Carole decided to trust her instincts. \"I\u0027m headed that way. You can come w ith me.\" \"Really? I don\u0027t remember seeing you there last night.\" \"I wasn\u0027t.\" Carole noticed that the woman was barefoot and limping. \"You sa id you were attacked. Did they . .. hurt you?\" The young woman nodded, then sobbed. \"They hurt me bad. Real bad.\" And then she was leaning against Carole and crying softly on her shoulder. Carole put her free arm around her and tried to soothe her, but kept her th umb on the button in her pocket. You never knew ... never knew ... After a few minutes the sobs stopped and the young woman stepped back. Sh e wiped her eyes with her bare arms. \"Sorry. It\u0027s just... it\u0027s been a long night.\" She pushed\\one of the pistols int o her waistband and stuck out a hand. \"Lacey. With an \u0027e.\u0027\" \"Carole,\" she said, shaking the hand and smiling, just a little. Something lika ble about her. \"With an \u0027e.\u0027 \" \"Were you a member of St. Anthony\u0027s parish?\" Lacey said as they started wa lking again. \"I was a nun in the convent.\" \"Get out! Then you must know my Uncle Joe. He\u0027s been a priest there for ye ars.\" Carole stopped walking and stared. Could this tough-looking tattooed youn g woman be related to Father Joe? \"You\u0027re Father Cahill\u0027s niece?\" She couldn\u0027t hide her disbelief. \"It\u0027s true, and I need to get back to him. He\u0027s got to have noticed I\u0027m missin g by now and he\u0027ll be worried sick.\" The genuine concern in Lacey\u0027s voice made Carole a believer, but sudden fe ar stabbed her. \"Hurry,\" Carole said. She flipped the safety cover closed on the button in h er pocket and broke into a fast walk. \"We\u0027ve got to get you back before he g oes out searching for you. Once he\u0027s away from the church he\u0027s in danger.\" JOE . . . They\u0027d started the search with the church grounds - the convent, the rectory, the graveyard - and then crossed the street to the office building. Finding that empty, Joe and the five other men in the search party, all armed to th e teeth, had moved through the surrounding houses and buildings. The discov ery of a man named Enrico stabbed to death in a neighboring Victorian had s haken them all, especially Joe. He\u0027d opened every door to every room in the old house with the expectation that he\u0027d find Lacey in the same condition. But no. No sign that she\u0027d ever been in the house. Lacey seemed to have van ished without a trace. Finally, at Joe\u0027s insistence, they\u0027d returned to the office building because t hat was the last place Lacey had been seen. Joe stood now at the head of the stairs in the dark third-floor hallway. He turned off his flashlight - to heighten his hearing as much as to save the bat teries - and called her name. \"Lacey! Lacey, can you hear me?\" He stood statue still and listened, but all he heard were the voices of the o ther members of the search party on the floors below. He felt numb, heartsick. Lacey... how had he let this happen? She\u0027d made it all the way down here from Manhattan on her own, and now she was gone, sna tched from under his protective wing. He could see how it had happened. She\u0027d felt safe here with other living around, armed with crosses and guns, re ady for anything. She\u0027d let her guard down, got careless . . . \"Lacey! Please!\" And then he heard it. A sound... scratching ... so soft it was barely aud ible. He opened his eyes, then squeezed them shut again, trying to locate th e sound. It seemed to come from everywhere at first, echoing off the walls o f the hallway, but as he concentrated he felt sure it was coming from somewh ere ahead and to his left. He opened his eyes and flicked on his flashlight. There. An open doorway with a red plaque saying something about AUT HORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY - ALARM WILL SOUND. No, it won\u0027t. It needed el ectricity for that. And besides, the door was already open. Joe played his beam along the concrete steps within. They ran one way: up. To the roof. The scratching sound was louder here. Definitely coming from t he top of the empty stairwell. Someone was scratching on the other side of the roof door. \"Lacey?\" he called as he took the steps two at a time. \"Lacey, is that you?\" He hesitated at the door, hand on the knob, afraid to turn it, afraid to see w hat was on the other side, afraid it might be Lacey, horribly injured. And afr aid it might not be Lacey. Might be one of them, lying in wait for a victim. He\u0027d hung his big silver cross around his neck before leaving tonight. He unsl ung it and held it ready, to wield as either club or firebrand. But still he h esitated. This was foolish. He should call for the others, go out there as a g roup. He turned and was about to call them when he heard the voice, a faint, agoni zed rasp. \"Help me... please. . . help\u0027\u0027 \"Lacey!\" Joe shoved the door open and stepped up onto the moonlit roof. Something he avy struck him at the base of his neck, sending shockwaves of pain down his arms and driving him to his knees. He lost his grip on the cross. Then a t hick quilted blanket was thrown over him. Before he could react he was knoc ked flat, rolled, and trussed up like an Oriental rug. Panicked, he kicked and twisted, but he was helpless. He shouted for the others but knew his cr ies were too muffled by the fabric to be heard. Joe felt himself lifted by his feet, dragged along the roof, and then he was f alling. They\u0027d thrown him off the roof! No. The cold, steely grip never released his ankles. And now he was rising in stead of falling, being carried through the air.

But with the fall of the Soviet Union, they began to spread across the continent, then the world, turning whole populations into vampires--or human cattle. Having overrun India, the far East, and the great cities of North and South America, the forces of Night are now spreading into the countryside to consolidate their conquest. In a town on the New Jersey shore, the vampires have just arrived, along with their human henchmen, the cowboys, who round up human cattle for the overlords in return for the promise of eternal life---later. For the vampires wish only a few of their own kind to rule, and feed. The rest of humanity are to be helpless herds, the source of the blood of life. Falsely accused of abuse, Father Joe is drunk in a basement waiting for the end. His superior has betrayed the local Catholic congregation and become a vampire. Sister Carole has become a formidable killer of cowboys and vampires. Dan\u0027s niece, escaped from the conquest of New York, has made her way south to find him. Brought together by Rabbi Zev Wolpin, who is shaken by the vampires\u0027 fear of the cross and holy water, they plan their resistance. Against all odds, they discover that there just might be a way for humanity to really fight back.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/midnight-mass.jpg","author":"F.
