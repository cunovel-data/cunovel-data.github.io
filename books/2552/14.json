{"id":111668,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"CAROLE . . .\n By Sunday evening they were ready to make their move.\n Fifty-three minutes before sundown, as soon as Joe was up and fed - Lacey\u0027s turn tonight - he got behind the wheel of the Navigator and drove down Bro adway. Lacey sat up front next to her uncle; Carole had the rear to herse lf.\n \"Are we ready for this?\" he said as they approached Thirty-fourth Street.\n Carole wasn\u0027t sure. She hoped so.\n They\u0027d learned through three days and three nights of steady surveillance t hat the Vichy - the more time she spent with Joseph and Lacey, the more Carol e found herself using that designation - stuck to a fairly rigid schedule of two shifts: a large contingent of perhaps twenty-five or thirty worked the days, while only a half dozen or so manned the entrance at night.\n They\u0027d taken over Houlihan\u0027s and turned the bar-restaurant into a cafeteri a of sorts. It served two meals a day - breakfast and dinner - at change of sh ift. Using binoculars, Carole and Lacey had watched from their perch acros s the street as the Vichy attacked heaps of scrambled eggs every morning - t he cook had to be using the powdered kind - and pots of some sort of stew ev ery evening.\n All three agreed that the meal break at shift change was the time to strike.\n All the Vichy were concentrated in Houlihan\u0027s then. They\u0027d settled on dawn, Monday, for their assault.\n But assault how?\n Joseph and Lacey had wanted to find a way to use the napalm, rig it someho w to explode and turn the restaurant into an inferno while the Vichy were eating their breakfast. But the \"somehow\" eluded them. And even if they di d manage to come up with a way to explode it, the napalm presented too man y chances for something to go wrong. If they were only partially successfu l - if they killed some but not all of the Vichy - they\u0027d have to abandon all hope of success. They couldn\u0027t win a fire fight with them, and from then o n the Vichy would be warned and on full alert.\n Carole had had a better idea. This was why she\u0027d brought along the canister of sodium fluorosilicate. She\u0027d had a feeling they might need a more silent form of death than bullets and napalm. She\u0027d found canisters of the chemical at one of the local municipal utility authorities where it was used to puri fy the water supply. At a few parts per million, sodium fluorosilicate was h armless. But ingestion of half a gram of the odorless and tasteless powder i nterfered with cellular metabolism, making you deathly ill. A gram caused co nvulsions and death. Not a pretty way to go, but probably better than being burned alive by napalm.\n Carole wished there were another way, one that could be delivered by someone else and not multiply the number of lives she\u0027d already taken. But there wa s nothing and no one. It was her idea, her responsibility. She couldn\u0027t shir k it off on someone else.\n The question was, how to get it into the Vichy? Obviously via their food.\n This evening\u0027s sortie would accomplish that - they hoped.\n Joseph turned the big SUV onto Thirty-fourth and said, \"Let\u0027s pray that th ose technicians I\u0027ve been watching don\u0027t eat with the rest of them tomorro w. We need them. And besides, they appear to be innocent. The three of the m seem older than the typical Vichy, they\u0027re unarmed, and dress like middl e managers. They arrive in a group every morning, flanked by two Vichy.\n They\u0027re not tied or manacled, but I get the impression they\u0027re prisoners of so me sort.\"\n \"But they could wind up sick or dead,\" Lacey said. \"Then what do we do?\"\n \"Please, God, don\u0027t let them,\" Carole said. She had blood on her hands, she was crimson to her elbows, but so far none of it was innocent.\n \"But what if they do?\" Lacey persisted.\n Joseph shook his head. \"I\u0027ve been watching three dawns in a row and not once have they eaten with the others. In fact, by the time they\u0027re brought in, bre akfast is just about done, and they\u0027re taken directly inside. Let\u0027s hope tomo rrow is no exception.\"\n Halfway between Sixth and Fifth Avenues, Joseph slowed the car to a crawl. Carole leaned forward, peering ahead between Joseph and Lacey toward th e lighted windows of Houlihan\u0027s, glowing like a beacon in the fading ligh t. She searched for signs of stray Vichy who\u0027d wandered away from the Fif th Avenue entrance around the corner where they usually hung out. But not hing was moving on the street except their car.\n \"Damn!\" Joseph said. \"The earring. Would somebody do the honor?\"\n Lacey fished the Vichy earring off the dashboard and punched it through his earlobe.\n \"Didn\u0027t feel a thing,\" he said. \"Are you ladies ready?\"\n \"Ready as I\u0027ll ever be,\" Lacey said. \"How about you, Carole?\"\n Carole could only nod. Her mouth was too dry for speech. They were entering the belly of the beast.\n Joseph swung the car into the curb and stopped. Houlihan\u0027s lit-up interior was empty. Dinner wasn\u0027t ready yet. The cook was back in the kitchen.\n \"I\u0027ll turn the car around and wait here. Hurry. And be careful.\"\n Carole watched Lacey shove a pair of steel bars she called \"nunchucks\" up th e left sleeve of her sweatshirt. She turned to Carole and took a deep, quave ring breath.\n \"Let\u0027s roll.\"\n Carole alighted with her backpack in her hand. She\u0027d removed the stakes an d crosses and hammer and replaced them with a football-size sack of sodium fluorosilicate. A pound of the stuff. Enough to kill the Empire State Bui lding\u0027s Vichy contingent a dozen times over.\n They hurried across the sidewalk, pushed through the revolving glass doors, and headed straight for the rear of the restaurant area. The air smelled sou r. The bar, tables, and floor were littered with paper plates, food scraps, and empty beer cans. Waves of glistening brown beetles scurried out of their way as they approached.\n \"Cockroaches,\" Carole whispered. \"I\u0027ve never seen so many.\"\n \"Maybe they feel some kinship with the clientele,\" Lacey replied.\n They paused outside the swinging doors to the kitchen. Light filtered thro ugh the two round, grease-smeared windows.\n \"Okay,\" Lacey said. \"I go first.\"\n She pushed through the doors; Carole followed. A fat, balding, cigar-chewing man in a bulging tank top stood before a stove, stirring a big pot. He look ed up as they entered.\n \"Who the fuck are you?\" he said.\n \"A couple of hungry ladies,\" Lacey said. \"Got any dinner you can spare?\"\n \"Yo.\" He grinned and grabbed his crotch. \"I got dinner right here.\"\n \"That\u0027s not exactly what we had in mind.\"\n \"You eat some of this, you get to eat some of what\u0027s cookin in the pot. Capi sce?\"\n While Lacey talked, Carole looked around the filthy mess of a kitchen. She didn\u0027t see a gun. The cook probably couldn\u0027t imagine he\u0027d need one. Immedia tely to her right she spotted the other thing she was looking for: half a d ozen ten-pound canisters of powdered eggs. One was open, its lid slightly a skew.\n \"I\u0027m kind of cranky right now,\" Lacey was saying. \"I\u0027m hungry, I\u0027ve got low blood sugar, and I\u0027m feeling premenstrual. You\u0027ll like me better when I\u0027m not hypoglycemic.\"\n \"Ay, this ain\u0027t no Let\u0027s Make A Deal.\" He jabbed a finger at Lacey. \"You d o me before you eat\" - then at Carole - \"and she does me after. Otherwise you can get the fuck outta here.\"\n Lacey sighed and took a step toward him. \"Oh, all right.\"\n He grinned and started loosening his belt. \"That\u0027s more like it!\"\n Lacey\u0027s hand darted to her sleeve and came up with her nunchucks. She whipp ed her hand around in a small circle, snapping her wrist and slamming one o f the steel bars against the side of the cook\u0027s head. He grunted and stagge red back, clutching his head. Lacey followed, swinging her nunchucks left, right, left, right, then vertically, connecting each time with either the m an\u0027s head or his raised elbows. With blood spurting from his face and scalp, the cook turned away, dropped to his knees, then fell forward, covering h is head with his hands and groaning.\n \"Stop, stop! Take what you want!\"\n \"Warned you I was cranky. Now get flat on your belly and stay there.\" He co mplied, leaving the patterned soles of his sneakers facing Carole. Lacey tu rned and gave her a nod.\n Carole knelt beside the open canister of powdered eggs and removed the lid.\n It was three-quarters full. A heavy metal scoop lay inside. She pulled the bag of sodium fluorosilicate out of her backpack and began scooping the eg g powder into its place.\n \"You could have been nice, you know,\" she heard Lacey saying. \"All we wan ted was something to eat. Didn\u0027t your mother ever teach you to share?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" the cook moaned. \"I\u0027m sorry!\"\n \"Now we\u0027ll have to take it.\"\n When Carole figured she\u0027d scooped out about two pounds of egg, she zipped up the backpack, then emptied the pound of sodium fluorosilicate into the canister. The chemical was white and the powdered egg was a pale yellow. She used the scoop to mix them into a consistent color, then replaced the l id.\n God forgive her. She\u0027d just sealed the fates and numbered the hours of doze ns of men. Vicious, evil men, but men nonetheless.\n \"All right,\" she told Lacey. \"I\u0027ve got the eggs.\"\n Lacey had the big chrome refrigerator door open and was peering inside.\n \"What have we here?\" she said. She reached in and removed what looked like a pepperoni and half a wheel of white cheese. \"Looks like cookie\u0027s got his own private stash!\" She turned to the cook and squatted beside him. \"All ri ght. We\u0027re leaving. Don\u0027t even think about moving or making a sound until w e\u0027re gone or I\u0027ll bust your head wide open and fry your brains on the grill. Capisce? \"\n The cook moaned and nodded.\n Lacey looked at Carole and waggled her eyebrows. \"Let go.\"\n JOE . . .\n Joe could see the kitchen doors through Houlihan\u0027s plate glass windows. He\u0027d watched Carole and Lacey push through them only a few minutes ago, bu t it seemed like an hour.\n \"Come on, ladies,\" he whispered. \"Come on.\"\n The idea was to make this look like a food raid - desperate people risking t heir lives to take food out, not leave something behind. That was why he\u0027d asked Lacey not to show a gun unless she had to. All it would take was on e shot to bring the Vichy running. Let them think the thieves who\u0027d hit th em were amateurs armed only with nunchucks and knives.\n Am I doing the right thing? he wondered for the thousandth time since they\u0027d arrived in New York. He had a feeling he wasn\u0027t.\n They were following his lead, trusting him with their lives. Was he, as the phrase went, exercising due diligence? He didn\u0027t know. All he knew was that once the idea of targeting Franco in his aerie had taken hold, he couldn\u0027t u proot it. He\u0027d considered other options, but none of them held a candle to t his. Because this was unquestionably the best tactic or because he\u0027d become fixated on Franco? Part of him argued that he should have sent either Carole or Lacey west, to try to cross into unoccupied territory with the secret. But a stronger part had countered that he needed both of them along to take Franco down, and that argument had prevailed.\n And he knew why. He had a secondary goal in mind, one he dared not tell Ca role and Lacey. They\u0027d never let him go through with it.\n But he had another concern. Joe was noticing wild mood swings. In life he\u0027d been prone to periodic lows that usually responded to a couple of stiff Scotches. Now he found himself experiencing surges of rage at the slightes t provocation. He\u0027d managed to control them so far. Like early this mornin g when Lacey had questioned him about some minor point in tonight\u0027s plan, he\u0027d had this sudden urge to grab her by the throat and scream at her to s top asking so many goddamned questions.\n He\u0027d managed to fight it off, but that urge still frightened him. Was it the stress, the responsibility of what they\u0027d planned, or was he edging closer to the darkness in his daymares? What if - ?\n Movement in the SUV\u0027s side mirror caught his attention. A Vichy, bearded and denimed like so many of them, had rounded the corner and was approach ing the Navigator with a raised pistol. Then Joe recognized him: the one who\u0027d been with the head Vichy in the Armani suit when Joe was dropped ou tside the front entrance.\n He\u0027ll recognize me! This will ruin -\n Wait. He won\u0027t recognize me.\n Joe had forgotten momentarily how his face had been disfigured by the sun.\n Easy to forget when you\u0027d never seen it, when mirrors gave back only a sm eary blur.\n \"What the fuck is this?\" the Vichy said, stepping up to the open driver wi ndow and leveling his semiautomatic at Joe. \"Who are you and what the fuck you think you\u0027re - shit! What happened to your face?\"\n That voice ... Joe remembered it taunting him in the long elevator ride to t he Observation Deck.\n I\u0027m glad I ain\u0027t you. Holy shit, am I glad I ain\u0027t you.\n \"Good morning,\" Joe said. \"Just waiting to pick up a friend. And the face? A n industrial accident.\"\n \"Who gives a shit. What\u0027re you doin here, man? You think this is some kinda taxi stand?\"\n Joe turned his head and showed his right earlobe. He flicked the dangly earri ng. \"Hey, I\u0027m in the club.\"\n \"That don\u0027t mean shit. Who you waitin for?\"\n Joe cudgeled his brain for the name of this guy\u0027s buddy, the one in the suit who\u0027d called him \"god-boy.\"\n \"Barrett,\" he said as it came back to him. \"He told me to meet him here at sundown.\"\n The Vichy\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Barrett\u0027s on night duty with me. Should be here any minute.\" He pulled open Joe\u0027s door. \"Let\u0027s go see about this.\"\n As Joe stepped out of the car, he saw movement in Houlihan\u0027s over the Vich y\u0027s shoulder: Carole and Lacey leaving the kitchen.\n Joe reached for the man\u0027s pistol and was surprised by how fast his hand mov ed. It darted out in a blur of motion; he grabbed the weapon and twisted it from his grasp. The Vichy jumped back with a shocked look and stared at hi s empty palm. Then he opened his mouth to shout but Joe\u0027s other hand reache d his throat first, fingers gripping the nape of his neck while the thumb j ammed against the windpipe. The man made a strangled sound. Joe pressed har der, hearing the cartilage crunch as it began to give way.\n Stop, he told himself.\n They\u0027d decided no killing tonight, it might rile the Vichy too much, send th em out hunting instead of staying close to Houlihan\u0027s and tomorrow\u0027s breakfa st.\n But this felt too, too good. And oh this man deserved dying for how he\u0027d ta unted him. Worse yet, he\u0027d seen too much.\n A crushed throat might raise too many alarms, though.\n With a heave Joe lifted him off his feet and hurled him head first toward the sidewalk. The back of his skull hit the concrete with a meaty crunch; his arms stiffened straight out to either side, then fell limp beside him.\n \"Joseph?\" It was Carole, stepping through the revolving door. She stared a t the body with the blood pooling around its head. \"What - ?\"\n \"Hey, Unk,\" Lacey said. \"I thought we said - \"\n \"In the car, both of you!\" he snapped. \"We\u0027ve wasted too much time already!\"\n Their fault. If they hadn\u0027t dawdled so damn long inside, this wouldn\u0027t have happened.\n The two women piled into the back seat as Joe slipped behind the wheel. He wanted to slam his foot against the accelerator and burn rubber out of here, but a quiet departure was best. When he reached Sixth he turned uptown on e block, then raced east on Thirty-fifth. Mostly pubs and parking garages a long this block. He pulled into a multi-level garage and parked far in the rear. If the Vichy went hunting for the thieves who stole their food and ki lled their man, they\u0027d never expect them to hide just one block away.\n As he shut off the engine he noticed a foul odor emanating from the back sea t.\n \"What is that?\" he said.\n \"Just some snack foods we picked up,\" Lacey said. \"A pepperoni and what l ooks like provolone.\"\n \"The pepperoni - does it have garlic in it?\"\n \"Probably, I - oops. Sorry about that.\"\n \"Throw it out.\"\n \"No way, Unk. We might never see another pepperoni again. But we\u0027ll eat it outside the car.\"\n Joe was halfway turned around, ready to grab the damn pepperoni and shove it down her throat when he stopped himself.\n He turned back and leaned his head against the steering wheel.\n What\u0027s happening to me? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/midnight-mass/page-14.html","bookId":2552,"book":{"id":2552,"title":"Midnight Mass","description":"Storyline: \n Vampires have always lived in Eastern Europe.
