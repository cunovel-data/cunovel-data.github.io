{"id":111663,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"JOE . . .\n He awoke in a snap. No lingering drowsiness, no stretching or yawning. Asle ep, then awake, with tentacles of a dream still clinging to him.\n The dream... more like a nightmare - or in this case, a daymare. He remembe red clinging to the lip of a rocky precipice, his feet dangling and kicking over an infinity of swirling darkness. But not empty darkness. This seemed a live, and it had been beckoning him, calling to him all day . . .\n The worst thing was that a part of him had longed to answer, tried to convinc e the rest of him to let go and tumble into that living abyss.\n He shook off the memory and pushed at the fabric enshrouding him. After an instant of panicked deja-vu - had he been buried again? - he remembered rolli ng himself in the bedspread this morning. He pulled his way free and found himself on the floor of the rear bedroom. The room was hot, stuffy, and d usty, but not dark. He lifted his head. Over the naked top of the double b ox spring he saw its mattress tilted against the west window. Orange sunli ght leaked around its edges. The sun was setting but not down yet.\n Not down yet...\n A sudden surge of excitement pushed him to his feet. He stepped closer to the mattress, surprised at not feeling stiff and sore after a whole day on woode n flooring. A ray of sunlight, dust motes swirling like fireflies along its p ath, was poking past the right edge to light up a square on the room\u0027s east w all. Hesitantly, Joe edged his hand toward the ray. This could hurt. This cou ld be like sticking his hand into a pot of boiling water.\n He gritted his teeth. Hell, what was he waiting for? Fast or slow, if he was going to burn, he was going to burn.\n He shot his hand forward and back, in and out of the ray. It felt hot but not hing like boiling water. He looked at his palm where the sun had licked it. No blisters. Not even red.\n He tried it again, this time holding his hand in the light. Hot, but bearable. Definitely bearable.\n Taking a breath, he tipped the mattress back, letting the light flood into th e room and bathe him. He gasped at the sudden blast of heat and squinted in t he brightness, but held his ground. He could do this. Yeah, he could do this.\n With jubilation spurring him, he hurried out into the front room where he f ound Carole asleep on the couch. He stopped and stared down at her, captiva ted. Her face in sleep had relaxed into a soft, gentle innocence, as if the last few months had never happened. This was the Carole he\u0027d known. He wan ted to wake her but couldn\u0027t bring himself to break the spell.\n He stepped back to the alcove and peeked in the front bedroom. Lacey lay h uddled under the covers.\n Okay, let them both sleep.\n Back to the front room where he slipped as quietly as possible through the broken door and out into the light. He walked a few steps north to where su nlight gushed between the bungalow and its neighbor. He bathed in its flow, spread his arms and dared it to harm him.\n \"Joseph? Are you all right?\"\n Carole\u0027s voice. He turned and saw her approaching across the boards. Her f eatures hadn\u0027t yet fully recomposed themselves into their harder, waking l ook. He wanted to throw his arms around her but knew that would be a mista ke.\n \"Yes. Fine. At least for now. How long till sunset do you think?\"\n She glanced at her watch. \"It set at 7:11 yesterday, so - \"\n \"Are you sure? I seem to remember the sun setting later than that in May.\"\n Carole shrugged. \"I guess I never got around to switching to Daylight Savin gs Time. Not much point, is there.\"\n \"I guess not. So you keep a log?\"\n \"In my head. It\u0027s very important to know when the sun is going to be around and when it\u0027s not.\"\n Of course it was. And he should have known that a former science teacher lik e Sister Carole would be methodical as all hell about it.\n \"When does it set tonight?\"\n \"About a minute later. Around forty-five minutes from now.\" She looked up f rom her watch. \"You seem to be able to tolerate the first and last hours of sunlight.\"\n \"Why is that, do you think?\"\n \"It may be due to your sun exposure before you turned. Maybe it burned some of the undead taint out of you, leaving you tolerant to the more attenuate d rays of the sun.\"\n \"Attenuated?\"\n \"As it nears the horizon, the sun\u0027s rays have to travel through more layers o f atmosphere to reach you. Those extra layers absorb and refract the light. I t\u0027s that same refraction that causes the sun and moon to look darker and larg er when they\u0027re low in the sky.\"\n \"Well, thank you, God, for refraction.\" He was glad he didn\u0027t have to face th e prospect of never seeing the sun again.\n \"Then again,\" Carole said, a faint smile playing about her lips, \"refraction may have nothing to do with it, and you should be thanking God directly.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Maybe He\u0027s given you these extra two hours as an edge over the undead. Two hours during which you can move about while they can\u0027t.\"\n Joe thought about that. Two hours ... if he was going to make a strike aga inst the undead, those two hours offered the perfect windows. He didn\u0027t kn ow about God Himself arranging this, but he knew a good thing when he saw it. He was not going to waste this advantage.\n \"I like the way you think, Carole. But first we need an agenda. And the first thing on that agenda should be contacting the church and letting those peopl e know I\u0027m still alive.\"\n \"But you can\u0027t let them see you like this, or let them know you - \"\n \"Absolutely not. We\u0027ll have to think of something that\u0027ll keep them together and fighting on without me. Because I\u0027ll be fighting my own war. I want to take the fight to the undead, get in their faces and hit them where it will really hurt: New York.\"\n Yes. Franco. He wanted to see that smug son of a bitch again - and when he d id, it would be on his terms, not Franco\u0027s.\n \"What\u0027s this about \u0027my\u0027 war?\" Lacey said. Joe turned to see her standing beh ind them, rubbing her eyes. \"This is our fight too, Unk.\"\n He smiled. \"I could use the help, but...\"\n The thought of either of these two precious people getting hurt because of him... he couldn\u0027t go there.\n \"But what?\" Lacey said. \"You\u0027re afraid we\u0027ll get killed or something? I figu re we\u0027re as good as dead if we do nothing, so we might as well go down doing something. Better than sitting on our asses and waiting for the ax to fall.\"\n Carole rolled her eyes. \"You have such a way with words.\"\n Lacey shrugged. \"Am I right or am I right?\"\n Joe had to admit she was right. He faced the reddened, swollen sun as it near ed the rooftops. He could look at it now, and it barely heated his skin.\n \"Okay then,\" he said. \"But we\u0027ll have to run this like a military operation.\"\n \"Does that mean you want to be made general?\" Lacey said through another yawn.\n \"No. Carole\u0027s the most experienced. She should be our general.\"\n Carole waved her hands. \"Oh, no. Not me.\"\n Lacey squinted at him. \"You know much about military operations?\"\n \"Not a thing. But I figure we need reconnaissance and intelligence. And mos t of all, we need to practice before we head for New York.\"\n Lacey nodded. \"Sort of like an out-of-town tryout before hitting Broadway, right?\"\n \"Right. And I think the local nests can provide just the sort of rehearsals we\u0027ll need.\"\n LACEY . . .\n \"We have to tell the parishioners something\" Joe said. \"Any ideas?\"\n Lacey watched him, looking for the first signs of what she knew must come. They were back in the bungalow, seated around the cocktail table in the same places as last night. A single candle set on the glass top lit their faces.\n \"Why don\u0027t we tell them the truth?\" Carole said.\n Lacey shook her head. \"This is one case where the truth shall not set them fre e. Besides, it\u0027s too . .. complicated.\"\n \"How about a form of the truth?\" Joe said. \"We\u0027ll tell them that the vampires attacked me, tried to turn me, but failed. I survived but I\u0027m badly hurt. I need time to recover and until I do... until I\u0027m back to my old self\" - which will be never, he thought grimly - \"I\u0027ve got to stay out of sight.\"\n \"Right,\" Lacey said, liking the idea. \"You\u0027re in hiding until you heal up becau se they\u0027re out there looking for you, trying to finish the job they started.\"\n \"Works for me,\" Joe said. \"How about you, Carole?\"\n \"Well...\" She frowned. \"It\u0027s not exactly true.\"\n \"But it\u0027s not exactly false,\" he said.\n She shrugged. \"I\u0027ve no objection, but if I were in their place I\u0027d be wonder ing why you wouldn\u0027t want to heal up among them ... safety in numbers and al l that.\"\n Joe didn\u0027t answer. All of a sudden he seemed distracted. Lacey watched his right hand trail down to his abdomen and press on it.\n Her heart sank. The hunger ... it was starting.\n She force-fed brightness into her tone. \"We\u0027ll just say that you feel it\u0027s sa fer to stay away. Your presence there might trigger an assault on the church, causing unnecessary casualties. When you\u0027re fully healed you\u0027ll return. But till then they must be brave and vigilant and keep up the fight, blah-blah-bl ah.\"\n Joe nodded absently, both hands over his stomach now. \"Good... sounds g ood.\"\n Carole said, \"Then the next question is, how do we get this message to them?\"\n Lacey kept her eyes on her uncle. \"How about a letter, hand written by their Father Joe himself? You and I could \u0027find\u0027 it and read it to the parishioners.\"\n Carole shook her head. \"They don\u0027t know his handwriting. Some of them will think it\u0027s a fake. Doubt will spread, ruining the whole plan.\"\n Carole was right. Lacey searched for an alternative. She thought of having Joe sneak up to the church at night and speak from the shadows to someone he trusted - Carl, maybe - but discarded the idea. Too chancy. Too many ways it could backfire, especially if anyone caught sight of his ruined face. They\u0027d think he was an impostor.\n Then it came to her, so obvious she kicked herself for not thinking of it imm ediately.\n \"We\u0027ll tape you! All we need is to get hold of a little cassette recorder and have you record your message. We leave it at the church for someone to find.\n It\u0027ll have a note saying it\u0027s from you. They\u0027ll play it and recognize your v oice. No doubters then.\"\n Carole nodded. \"Brilliant. I know a Radio Shack not far from here that ought to have a cassette recorder.\"\n Lacey looked at Joe. His teeth were clenched. He didn\u0027t seem to be listening.\n She grabbed the flashlight and headed for the bathroom. Not that there was a ny water pressure in the town\u0027s system to make the bathroom useful for its in tended functions, but she needed to be away from Carole. She placed the flash light on the glass shelf under the medicine cabinet. . . next to the steak kn ife she\u0027d left here earlier just for this purpose.\n Picking up the knife, she called, \"Uncle Joe? Could you come in here a sec?\"\n When she heard him approaching, she bit her lip and sliced the pad of her le ft index finger. She jumped with the pain, almost dropping the knife.\n Damn, that hurt!\n She placed the knife in the sink and cupped her right hand under the finger.\n \"Something wrong?\" Joe said as he came up behind her.\n \"Close the door, will you?\"\n When she heard it close she turned and held her bloody finger up to his lips. \"Here,\" she whispered. \"I know you need it.\"\n He turned his head and stepped back. \"No!\"\n Lacey stepped closer. \"I thought we settled this last night!\" she hissed. \"\n This is something you need and something I want to give. Don\u0027t do this, Unk. I\u0027m already cut and bleeding.\" She pushed her finger toward his mouth. \"Take what you need.\"\n With a groan he grabbed her hand and pressed her finger to his lips. He suc ked hungrily for an instant, then pushed her hand away.\n \"Enough!\" The word sounded as if it had been ripped from deep inside him.\n \"You\u0027re sure?\"\n He looked away and nodded. \"Look... I\u0027m going out. I need to do some recon noitering, see if I can locate a nest or two.\"\n \"Want us to come along?\" She opened the medicine cabinet and found a tin of Band-Aids.\n He shook his head. \"Better if I do this alone. I\u0027ll be less noticeable solo.\"\n He glanced at her, then away again. \"Lend me the car keys.\"\n \"Carole has them.\"\n \"Can you get them for me?\"\n \"Just ask - \"\n \"Please?\"\n Lacey bit back a remark. She wrapped a Band-Aid around her finger and retu rned to the front room.\n \"Is everything all right?\" Carole asked. Her eyes darted from Lacey\u0027s face, t o her bandaged finger then to her eyes again.\n \"He needs the car to go hunt up some targets. Where are the keys?\"\n Carole fished them out of her sweatsuit pants pocket. \"Alone?\"\n \"He thinks it\u0027ll be better that way.\"\n Lacey took the keys back to the bathroom. \"I don\u0027t understand you,\" she whis pered. \"I thought we straightened this out last night.\"\n \"We didn\u0027t.\" His voice was barely audible. \"I said we\u0027d see.\"\n \"Okay. We\u0027ve seen. And it was quick and simple. Now tell me, why wouldn\u0027t you get keys yourself?\"\n \"Because ... because Carole\u0027s in there. One look at me and she\u0027d know.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"Let\u0027s just drop it.\"\n \"No. Tell me.\"\n \"Because... because I can\u0027t bear being in her presence after doing this. I f eel so ... so diminished.\" He squeezed her hand. \"Got to go.\"\n You poor, poor man, she thought, staring at him. You\u0027ve got it bad, don\u0027t you. And this is tearing you apart.\n He squeezed past her and stepped into the front room. He turned right, headi ng for the rear of the bungalow.\n \"Good-bye, Carole,\" he said in a choked voice without looking at her. \"I\u0027ll be back around sunrise.\"\n Lacey leaned against the sink until she heard the back door open and close, t hen she returned to the front room. \"Carole,\" she said. \"We\u0027ve got to talk.\"\n JOE . . .\n Standing in the deep moon shadows, he watched the church from afar, listen ed to the hymns echoing from within, saw the daylight-bright glow gushing through the open front doors, and yearned to go inside.\n But that was not to be. The huge crucifix hanging over the sanctuary and t he dozens of crosses on the walls - crosses he\u0027d helped fashion with his own hands - would blind him now, make his presence there an ongoing agony. That part of his life was over. The simple comfort of kneeling in a pew and le tting the cool serenity of the church ease the cares and tensions from his soul would be forever denied him. And as for saying Mass . . .\n The longing pushed a sob to the back of his throat but he forced it down. In his other existence he might have felt tears running down his cheeks, but t hey remained dry. The undead don\u0027t have tears. Their hair doesn\u0027t grow. They don\u0027t progress or regress, they simply are.\n He was about to turn away when movement to his right caught his eye. His n ight vision picked out a figure - balding, with a ripe gut bulging over his belt - leaning behind a tree.\n Joe, it seemed, wasn\u0027t the only one watching the church.\n He bent into a crouch and moved a few yards closer. He caught the flash of a Vichy earring.\n Not surprising that the undead would want to keep an eye on the church. They had to be furious and more than a little unsettled by these defiant \"cattle.\"\n With a start Joe realized that they might be watching for him.\n Of course. Franco had expected him to rise from the dead in the rectory an d start feeding on the parishioners. He must know by now that that hadn\u0027t happened. He\u0027d want to know why. Never in a thousand years would he guess the truth.\n Franco had to be baffled. His beautiful plan had gone awry. More than awry, it had gone bust. He had to be furious.\n Joe cradled the thought, letting it warm him, feeling the best he\u0027d felt all nigh t.\n He found a place between a couple of waist-high shrubs where he could watch the watcher without being seen. He settled onto the ground. Despite his li ghtweight shirt and shorts, the damp earth and cool breeze didn\u0027t chill him. He felt perfectly comfortable. Extremes of temperature didn\u0027t seem to bot her him.\n What else wouldn\u0027t bother him? He had much to learn about, this new existen ce, this altered body he\u0027d be wearing into the future.\n The future... what did that mean anymore? How long could he exist? Would he go on indefinitely like the true undead? And beyond that hazy future, w hat of his salvation? What of his soul? Did he still have one?\n The possibility jolted him. What if his soul had departed after Devlin had torn him up? Was he an empty vessel now, marked and doomed to wander the earth like Cain, offensive to the sight of God and man?\n Joe shifted his gaze to the dark blotch of the graveyard to the left of the church. He could almost pick out Zev\u0027s grave among the shadows.\n Zev, he thought. Where are you, old friend?\n How he wished he were here tonight, sitting beside him. He longed for the c omfort of his wit, the honed edge of his Talmudic intellect. He wouldn\u0027t ha ve answers, but he\u0027d know the questions to ask, and together they might com e to understand this, or at least find a path toward understanding.\n Here, on his own, would he ever understand what he\u0027d become? Was there an yone else like him on earth? He doubted it. He was sui generis.\n The quote, Alone and afraid in a world he never made, trailed through his h ead. Whoever wrote that hadn\u0027t been thinking of Joe Cahill, but could have been.\n Joe watched the watcher through the night. When the sky started to lighten, t he Vichy slunk away from the tree and started walking south. Pistol in hand, the man kept to the center of the street, looking wary. Dear Carole, all on h er own, had filled their rotten hearts with terror.\n Joe paralleled his path, traveling through the backyards of the deserted hou ses lining the street, catching only occasional glimpses of him between the buildings, but that was enough.\n Although Joe\u0027s was a much more difficult route, hopping fences and ducking through hedges, he felt no sense of exertion. He wasn\u0027t even breathing hard.\n He stopped as he realized with a start that he wasn\u0027t breathing at all. He h ad to take in air in order to talk, but otherwise he didn\u0027t need to breathe.\n No blood, no respiration - what was powering his body? He didn\u0027t know, might never know.\n He\u0027d lost ground on the Vichy and hurried to catch up. The task of tailing him became dicier as he entered the business district. Too open, with no co ver. Joe had to settle for huddling in a doorway and watching him. After wh at Lacey had told him about her abduction, he had a good idea of where the man was headed.\n Sure enough, the Vichy stopped before the Post Office where he met with ano ther pair of his kind.\n And then, out of the shadows, a group of undead, seven males and a female, a ppeared as a group. Joe couldn\u0027t make out their faces from this distance. He couldn\u0027t hear their words, either, but he saw a lot of shaking heads and te nse, unhappy postures.\n He was more sure now than ever that they\u0027d been searching for him.\n With the arrival of another trio of Vichy, the first three left. The second th ree took up guard positions as all eight undead trudged up the Post Office ste ps. Joe noticed that six of the males clustered around the female while a lone male brought up the rear. Something familiar about that solitary figure, but Joe couldn\u0027t place it.\n No time to think about it either. He broke into a run. Dawn was coming and h e had to race the sun to the beach. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/midnight-mass/page-9.html","bookId":2552,"book":{"id":2552,"title":"Midnight Mass","description":"Storyline: \n Vampires have always lived in Eastern Europe.
