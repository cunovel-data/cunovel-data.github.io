{"id":111664,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"CAROLE . . . Soon. Carole sat on the bungalow\u0027s tiny rear deck and watched the sun\u0027s lazy fall toward the horizon. A beautiful end to the day. She might have enjoyed it bu t for the adrenaline buzzing through her. A good day ... as good as could be expected. In these times, a good day wa s when nothing unusually ugly occurred. Joseph had made it home just after sunrise. Before dropping into a deathlik e sleep in the rear bedroom, he\u0027d spoken into the cassette recorder Carole and Lacey had looted from the Radio Shack. Was it really looting? she wondered. Did taking something from a store that was never going to reopen make you a looter? It seemed like a silly thing to worry about, but she did. When Carole had asked Lacey what she thought, she\u0027d replied, \"Who gives a shit?\" Maybe Carole needed to adopt more of that attitude. Carole had returned to the church this morning and, when no one was watching, left the recorder on the front steps. It seemed to take forever, but event ually someone found it and played it for the congregation. Cheers and tears - that was the only way Carole could describe the reaction. A t least initially. It took a while for the anger to set in, but when it came it was fierce. The undead and their collaborators had tried to turn their Father Joe. A craven, cowardly, backstabbing act. The anger bound the parishi oners even more closely. They\u0027d stay on and fight harder. To the death if ne ed be. Carole tried to draw strength from the memory of their boisterous resolve. For soon she would have to do what she and Lacey had discussed. Part of h er hummed with anticipation while an equal part recoiled. Joseph had awakened a short while ago. He and Lacey were inside, talking. The indistinguishable murmur of their voices drifted through the open glass door, mixing with the thrum of the waves and the calls of the gulls. Her heart kicked up its tempo as their voices faded. That meant that they we re heading for the front bedroom. Soon ...too soon . . . \"Okay.\" Carole jumped and turned at the sound of Lacey\u0027s voice. \"Now?\" How inane. Of course now. That was why Lacey was here. Carole rose unsteadily. Did she have the nerve for this? Lacey pressed the steak knife into her hand. \"He\u0027s waiting.\" Carole nodded, took the knife, and headed for the bedroom. When she reache d the alcove she hesitated. She wiped a sweaty palm on the pants of her sw eatsuit, then forced herself forward. I can do this, she thought. I must do this. Joe was sitting on the bed, head down, hands clasped between his knees, loo king like a man on death row. He didn\u0027t look up as she entered. \"Okay,\" he said, his voice hoarse. \"Let\u0027s get this over - \" He must have sen sed something. His head snapped up. \"Carole? Sorry. I was expecting Lacey.\" Her tongue felt like flannel. \"It won\u0027t be Lacey today.\" Before he could understand, before he could protest, Carole clenched her tee th and jabbed the point of the knife into the center of her palm. She suppre ssed a gasp of pain as the blade pierced her skin. \"No!\" Joseph was on his feet. \"No, don\u0027t!\" \"It\u0027s already done,\" she said. \"Carole, I can\u0027t.\" He backed away a step. \"Not you.\" She held out her hand, cupping her palm to hold the pooling blood. \"Yes. Me. It\u0027s only fair. I don\u0027t want to be left out.\" That wasn\u0027t quite the way Lacey had put it last night after Joseph had left so abruptly. She\u0027d said that if the three of them were going to work together, be a team, then they\u0027d have to act and feel like a team. \"One for all and all for one, and all that shit,\" she\u0027d said. Which meant they had to feel at ease with each other, and that would never happen unless someone broke through the wall of shame that had sprung up between Carole and her uncle. Joseph couldn\u0027t do it. Only Carole had the p ower. Lacey had known one sure way for Carole to break through. It was radical, she\u0027d warned, something her uncle would balk at - and Carole wouldn\u0027t be too crazy about it either - but it had to be done. Joseph was shaking his head, his mouth working but saying nothing. She could read no expression in his scarred face, but his eyes looked terrified. Still cupping her hand, Carole sat on the bed. She placed the knife beside he r and tugged on his sleeve. \"Sit, Joseph,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve given so much, had so much stolen from yo u, let me give something to you.\" \"No!\" \"Why will you take it from Lacey but not from me? Do you think there\u0027s s omething wrong with my blood?\" \"No, of course not.\" \"They why not me?\" \"Because ...\" He shook his head. \"Please don\u0027t reject me.\" She felt a thickness in her throat, heard a catch in her voice. \"I couldn\u0027t bear it if you turned me away.\" Joseph must have heard it too. He slumped next to her. \"Carole . .. you don\u0027t have to do this.\" \"I do. I want to.\" That hadn\u0027t been quite true when she\u0027d stepped into the room, but now, this cl ose to him, feeling his anguish, she wanted to be part of this, she wanted thi s bond, terrible as it was. She held her cupped palm beneath his chin. \"Please?\" With a groan Joseph bent his head and pressed his lips against her palm. A s hiver ran through her as his tongue swirled against her skin. So close... she\u0027d never dreamed they\u0027d be this close. Carole felt him swallow, then with a sob he pushed her hand away and sagged against her, resting his head on her thighs, facing away. \"Oh, Carole, I\u0027m so sorry. So sorry.\" She made a fist over her cut palm to stanch the bleeding. Her other hand ros e of its own accord, hovered over his head for a few heartbeats, then droppe d and began stroking his hair. \"You have nothing to apologize for, Joseph,\" she said softly. \"This was not y our choosing. It\u0027s not your fault.\" He said nothing. For a moment she feared he might rise and leave the room, but he didn\u0027t move. She said, \"You almost told me why you didn\u0027t want to take my blood. You got as far as \u0027Because.\u0027 Can you tell me the rest?\" \"Because ...\" He took a breath. \"Because I love you.\" She gasped, her hand recoiling from him as if it had been burned. Joseph began to lift his head. \"I\u0027m sorry. I shouldn\u0027t have - \" \"No - no,\" she said, gently pushing his head back down. \"Don\u0027t move.\" She couldn\u0027t let him see her face right now, for she knew her heart must be shining in h er eyes. \"It\u0027s all right. It\u0027s... it\u0027s ...\" The intoxicating feelings bursting through her... she\u0027d never felt anythin g like this before. It was indescribable. Her words dried up and blew away li ke dead leaves. I love you... had he really said that? \"It\u0027s wonderful,\" she managed. \"I\u0027m not talking about love as for a fellow human being. I\u0027m saying that I l ove you as a woman.\" \"All the more wonderful,\" she said. \"Because I\u0027ve felt the same way about y ou.\" Now his head shot up and she couldn\u0027t stop it. He stared at her, mouth agap e. \"What?\" She could only nod. She felt tears brimming her eyelids and didn\u0027t trust herse lf to speak. \"That can\u0027t be,\" he said. She nodded again and forced the words past the swelling in her throat. \"I was taken with you the day you arrived to replace Father McMann. And as I came to know you, I came to love you.\" \"You mean \u0027loved,\u0027 don\u0027t you.\" \"No. I still do. More than ever.\" He looked away. \"You can\u0027t. That man is gone.\" She touched his scarred cheek. \"No. He\u0027s been changed, but he\u0027s not gone. He\u0027s still there, inside. I feel him when you\u0027re near, I hear him when you spe ak.\" \"Maybe he\u0027s there now, but I don\u0027t know much longer you can count on him being around.\" \"I have faith in you.\" \"I appreciate that, Carole but. . . I\u0027ve been having a dream, the same dream yesterday and today. Hanging from a precipice over this swirling darkness t hat\u0027s calling to me, beckoning to me.\" \"But - \" He held up a hand. \"I know what you\u0027re going to say, but this doesn\u0027t feel sy mbolic. This feels real. It bothers me that part of me wants to let go and fa ll into that abyss. But that\u0027s all right. I think I can handle that. What bot hers me more is there\u0027s no sense of light above me trying to draw me the othe r way. Only the darkness below.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"Where\u0027s the balance? The darkness seems to be in control with nothing oppo sing it. Nothing but us.\" \"God is out there, Joseph, working through us.\" \"Not working too well, I\u0027d say. Look what\u0027s happened to me.\" She wanted to tell him that what had happened to him might be all part of God\u0027s plan, but held back. Now was not the time. He shook his head. \"All those years at St. Anthony\u0027s... you loving me, I loving you, longing for you, and neither of us knew. Imagine if things had b een different... what a team we\u0027d have made, Carole.\" \"We\u0027re a team now, at least part of one.\" \"Yes, but the possibilities ... all gone now.\" He laid his head back on her th ighs. \"Gone for good.\" She began stroking his hair again. \"We\u0027re together now.\" \"But look what it took for us to find out how we felt about each other. You\u0027ve been through a living hell since Easter week, and I. . . I\u0027m not even hum an anymore.\" \"I don\u0027t care what you are. I know who you are.\" After a while he said, \"Sex is out of the question, you know.\" \"Yes. We both still have our vows.\" \"I don\u0027t mean that. I mean... one of the changes in me... one of the things they stole from me ... I don\u0027t think I ever can.\" Carole said nothing. It didn\u0027t matter. They stayed this way a long time, Joseph lying still against her thighs, Caro le stroking his hair, soothing him, murmuring to him. In the world outside th e horror still raged all about them, but here, in this moment, in this place, she\u0027d found a sliver of peace, the closest to heaven she\u0027d ever been. CAROLE . . . Lacey burst out laughing. She couldn\u0027t help it. Joe glanced up from where he sat across from her at the little dining room t able. \"What\u0027s so funny?\" \"I was just thinking what a cozy little domestic scene this is. Here\u0027s Pap a Joe, sharpening stakes to drive through undead hearts. There\u0027s Momma Car ole at the sink mixing up a batch of napalm. And here\u0027s baby Lacey cleanin g her 9mm pistols.\" She laughed again. \"We\u0027re the new nuclear family!\" Carole turned from the sink where she was stirring a strange mix with a lar ge wooden spoon, and gave her a wry smile. \"Nuclear... there\u0027s a thought.\" \"No, Carole,\" Joe said. \"Don\u0027t go there.\" What a change in Carole and Joe. Their meeting in the bedroom had transfor med them. They\u0027d come out leaning close to each other. Lacey wouldn\u0027t have been surprised if they started holding hands, but they didn\u0027t. Joe seemed so much more at ease in her presence, and Carole ... well, Carole positiv ely glowed. All because of me, Lacey thought. Did I have the situation and solution naile d or what? Am I brilliant or am I brilliant? After Joe had fed, they went their separate ways. Joe took the car to Lake-wood to work out a plan of attack on the Post Office. Carole walked down to the abandoned business district on Arnold Avenue to do what she termed some \"shopping.\" Lacey hoped that neither of them ran into Vichy along the way. Her own job was simpler. Armed with a makeshift siphon, she\u0027d been assigne d the task of finding gasoline. That had proved a cinch. Her first stop had been the garage behind the bunga low where she discovered an old Ford convertible with a full tank. She found a dusty five-gallon gas can, probably for a motorboat, and filled that. Carole returned later with a shopping cart loaded with boxes of different br ands of soap flakes, some lighter fluid, plus a bag of sundries from a party supply shop. She immediately set up in the kitchen and went to work filling the house with fumes. Lacey held up one of the 9mm rounds and showed it to Joe. \"Look at this. Hollow point. They\u0027re all hollow points.\" Joe shook his head. \"Nasty things. I hear they make a little hole going in an d a great big hole coming out.\" \"Why would the undead be carrying automatics loaded with these?\" \"To protect against humans, I imagine,\" Joe said. \"They\u0027re strong, they\u0027re f ast, but that\u0027s not enough if they\u0027re attacked by a mob.\" He pointed to the round. \"That\u0027s probably what the Vichy will be using against us this morning - if they get the chance.\" \"Let\u0027s go over the plan again,\" Lacey said. She wasn\u0027t crazy about it. As much as she respected her uncle\u0027s intelligence, he\u0027d had no military training, had never engaged in any sort of violent ac tivity. Lacey had at least studied martial arts. That wasn\u0027t much, but it ha d trained her on how to size up an opponent, how to look for strategic openi ngs. Joe\u0027s plan seemed to depend on too many variables. \"Okay,\" Joe said. \"The Vichy guards spend most of their time hanging around on the front steps. When they\u0027re not smoking they\u0027re sleeping. They\u0027re bor ed and don\u0027t take their job seriously. No one\u0027s ever attacked them on duty like that and they probably think no one ever will. We\u0027re going to change t hat.\" \"Hitting them at dawn I understand, but why napalm? Why don\u0027t we just sh oot them?\" \"Because we\u0027re not marksmen - or, excuse me, markswomen - and we can\u0027t afford a protracted gun battle because my clock will be running. If they hold out past my sun tolerance, we\u0027ll have lost more than the battle. We won\u0027t be able to take them by surprise again. But more than that, the more bullets flying, the greater chance of you or Carole getting hit.\" \"But how do we know the napalm will work?\" Joe\u0027s idea was for the three of them to climb to the roof of the building acr oss the street and each toss a napalm-filled balloon onto the Vichy as they l ounged on the Post Office steps below. The street wasn\u0027t wide and it was an e asy throw from the roof. Or so he said. \"Oh, it will work,\" Carole said from the sink. \"Have no fear of that.\" \"But it has to ignite.\" \"We\u0027ll make sure one of them\u0027s smoking before we toss.\" \"That doesn\u0027t guarantee it will light.\" Joe leaned back, staring at her. For a moment she thought he was angry but couldn\u0027t be sure. So hard to gauge emotions when a face has no expression. \"You\u0027re right,\" he said finally. \"It doesn\u0027t.\" He turned toward the kitchen. \"Do we have any gasoline left, Carole?\" \"A little. Why?\" \"Save half a dozen ounces or so. We\u0027re going to bring along a Molotov cock tail.\" He turned back to Lacey. \"Better?\" \"You mean throw that first, then the napalm?\" He nodded. \"Yeah,\" Lacey said. \"That\u0027ll work.\" JOE . . . \"Oh, no!\" Joe said as he heard a thwacking noise and the car began to vibra te. He slammed a fist against the steering wheel. \"Damn!\" They\u0027d left an hour before dawn. The plan had been to loop north of Lak ewood through Howell and approach downtown from the west. They were on Aldrich Road when the noise began. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Carole said. She sat next to him in the front, Lacey sat in th e rear with the arsenal. \"Can you believe it? We\u0027ve got a flat!\" He popped the trunk and jumped out. Of all times for something like this to happen. \"Can\u0027t we drive on the rim?\" Carole said. \"Any other time I\u0027d say fine, but we can\u0027t risk the racket it will make.\" He lifted the trunk lid and was relieved to find the spare present and inflated. Nearly half an hour later they were rolling again. \"That took too long,\" Carole said. \"Maybe we should put this off till tomorr ow.\" She\u0027s probably right, Joe thought. What\u0027s another day? But something inside wouldn\u0027t allow him to agree. He was primed and ready for a little payback. More than ready - aching. \"Let\u0027s see how things look,\" he said. \"If we can\u0027t do it the way we planned, we\u0027ll call it off.\" He looked at Carole and wanted to take her hand. He couldn\u0027t believe it. All these years she\u0027d been as attracted to him as he\u0027d been to her, and neither of them had had a clue. How sad, he thought. And how wonderful to be past t hat now. They reached Lakewood just as the sun was rising. They parked two blocks fro m the business district and lugged their milk crate full of bottles, balloon s, and guns between the buildings until they wound up in an alley across the street and half a block up from the Post Office. The three-man Vichy day sh ift was on the job, so to speak, smoking and lounging on the steps. One of t hem sat near a shotgun that leaned against a wall; the other two had holster ed pistols. Carole was looking at her watch. \"We\u0027ll have to call it off. By the time we ca rry all this stuff up to the roof and start the attack\" - she looked up at Joe - \"it will be too late for you.\" Joe looked at the brightening sky. Damn. She was right. \"All right. Let\u0027s head back to the car and - \" \"Wait,\" Lacey said. \"Give me a minute here.\" \"For what?\" Joe said. Her jaw was set and her eyes had gone flat and cold. She worked the slide on one of her pistols and stuck it into the waistband of her jeans at the small of her back. \"Lacey?\" Before Joe could stop her she stepped out onto the sidewalk and began walki ng toward the Vichy. He wanted to call her back but didn\u0027t dare reveal hims elf. With the sun lighting her back, she moved briskly, hips swaying, arms swinging at her sides. Joe could only peek around the corner and pray. She was halfway to the Post Office before they noticed her. \"Hey, girl,\" one of them said, shading his eyes as he squinted into the glar e. \"Where you goin?\" \"Just passing through,\" she told him. The two who\u0027d been stretched out on the steps were now on their feet, hands on hips, looking toward her and grinning. \"What\u0027s your hurry?\" said a big-bellied one. \"No hurry,\" she said. \"Just got places to go.\" Joe watched them move out into the street to intercept her. What is she do ing? he wondered. Has she gone crazy? \"Oh, I don\u0027t think so,\" said the first one. \"I think you\u0027re gonna stop and visit.\" Lacey was within half a dozen feet of them now. \"Been there, done that. He y, boys... don\u0027t you remember me?\" With that she reached behind her, ripped her pistol free, and began firing w ildly, pulling the trigger as fast as it would allow. Joe saw the one with t he shotgun take a round in the chest. His arms flew outward as the bullet pu nched him back. Lacey\u0027s second shot went wild but the third caught the fat o ne in the gut. The last Vichy was drawing his pistol when Lacey\u0027s fourth sho t caught him in the shoulder, spinning him around. Four shots, three hits, but she didn\u0027t stop there. She kept firing. Joe leaped out from the alley and dashed toward her as she stood over the three downed men and pumped round after round into their twitching bodies. He reached her as the slide on her pistol locked back on empty. He grabbed her shoulders and spun her to face him. \"Lacey! What - ?\" Then he saw the tears streaming down her cheeks. \"It was them, Uncle Joe,\" she sobbed. \"I recognized them. They\u0027re the ones who - \" She closed her eyes and took a deep, shuddering breath. Joe glanced at their blood-splattered remains. \"Lacey ... Jesus. . . are you - ? \"I\u0027m okay. That was for Enrico ... and me. Let\u0027s just get this done and get ou t of here, okay?\" Joe opened his mouth to speak - he figured he should say something - but his mind was blank. He settled for a curt nod. They could talk later. Carole arrived then with her book bag full of stakes and hammers. She took one look at the bodies, then put her arm around Lacey\u0027s shoulders. \"It\u0027s all right, Lacey. You did the Lord\u0027s work.\" Lacey irritably shrugged off her arm. \"That wasn\u0027t any lord\u0027s work - that wa s mine.\" Joe caught the flash of hurt in Carole\u0027s eyes and felt bad for her. Lacey\u0027s rough edges weren\u0027t getting any smoother. No time now to explain his niece t o Carole. He took the book bag from her and turned toward the Post Office. \"Let\u0027s go-He led the way up the steps. Once inside he looked around. Empty. Sunlight began to stream through the east windows. \"If there\u0027s a cellar, that\u0027s where they\u0027ll be.\" Lacey pointed to a door to the left of the clerk windows. \"I saw the woman and her entourage go through there.\" The door was locked. No problem. Joe kicked it open. Another door, unlocked, opened onto a flight of stairs leading down into a darker space. \"We\u0027ll do as many as we can in the time we have,\" he said, reaching into th e bag and handing out the flashlights. \"But we do the woman first. From wha t I\u0027ve seen, she seems to be in charge.\" He didn\u0027t need a light of his own. The stairwell appeared well lit to him. He hurried down to where the steps made a sharp right turn at the bottom i nto a dank, dusty space - - and there they were. He could see all eight of them in the cool darkness, st retched out on an assortment of beds and cots. Like a dormitory in hell. If t heir daysleep was anything like his the past two nights, it was like death. Joe looked around. Concrete walls, no windows, junk piled in the near-righ t corner. He spotted the woman\u0027s bed on the far side of the room next to t he wall and immediately moved toward her. Even if they managed to stake on ly one this morning, he wanted it to be her - to send a message back to Fran co that nobody he sent here was safe. Eventually he wanted Franco to know that not even he was safe. \"Hey,\" Lacey called from behind him. \"This guy\u0027s awake.\" \"This one too,\" Carole said. Joe had been so fixed on the woman that he\u0027d paid no attention to her six g uards, arrayed around her like spokes on a wheel. He looked down at the nea rest and nearly jumped when he saw wide dark eyes staring back at him, shar p teeth bared in a snarl. Joe didn\u0027t understand. How could they be awake? \"Forget them for now. The woman first.\" He stopped at her bedside and found her awake as well. She lay on her back, staring up at him in fear and wonder. \"This is really creepy,\" Lacey said. Joe had to agree. What was going on here? Unless.. . maybe the gunfire outs ide had roused them. At least none of them was able to get up. No time to waste. He dropped the book bag on her abdomen and pulled out t he heavy maul and one of the stakes. Carole stepped up beside him and pla yed her beam over the woman, illuminating the corner of the room like day light. Joe lifted the stake. This wasn\u0027t how he\u0027d expected this to go. He hadn\u0027t cou nted on his victims staring him in the face as he pounded stakes through thei r chests. But this was no time for squeamishness. Steeling himself, he placed the shar pened tip against her chest, just to the left of her breastbone. He\u0027d never done this before, but he imagined that was where the heart sat. As he raised the hammer, the woman hissed and grabbed the stake with both of her hands. Joe jumped back in surprise, releasing his own grip. \"Dear God!\" Carole gasped. \"She can move!\" Joe recovered and snatched the stake back from her grasp. He broke her grip easily. \"But she\u0027s weak,\" he said. A deafening blast echoed through the basement and Joe felt a stabbing impact, like a punch, in his back. A shot! Another blast as he half turned - another blow, this time to his shoulder. \"Get down!\" he shouted to Carole and Lacey. \"Way down!\" He feared the ricochets in this concrete box could be almost as deadly as a d irect hit. He turned and found the shooter, the pistol wavering in his hand a s he aimed another shot. Joe ducked to his left, darted to the man\u0027s side, an d snatched the gun from his hand. \"Hey!\" Lacey cried, popping her head up. She pointed to a guard near her. \"T his one\u0027s going for his gun too!\" \"Get it!\" Joe shouted. He turned and lunged for another of the woman\u0027s guar ds who was lifting his automatic, moving like someone in a slow-motion movi e. Joe tore it from his grasp. \"Get their guns! All of them.\" He saw Lacey struggling with her guard. She had a two-handed grip on the ba rrel. Joe was just about to step in and help when she twisted it from his g rasp. He turned and saw Carole pulling a pistol from another guard\u0027s belt b efore he could reach it. Joe disarmed two more, then stepped over to the se venth male, the one with the cot against the opposite wall, and found him u narmed. \"You!\" Joe cried when he spotted his ruined left eye. This was one of Franco\u0027s guards, the one who\u0027d stripped him naked before t aking him to his boss. What had Franco called him? \"Artemis!\" That was it. \"What are you doing here?\" The good eye widened. \"You know me?\" the vampire rasped. That surprised Joe for an instant, then he remembered that his face had be en changed by the sun. He wished he knew what he looked like. He jabbed one of the pistols at him. \"Too bad you didn\u0027t bring Franco with you. When we finish with the lady, you\u0027re next!\" This was perfect: the woman and Franco\u0027s right-hand man in one morning. He turned and stalked back toward the guards, snatching up a couple of mache tes as he reached them. \"Take their machetes too. Don\u0027t leave them with an ything that can be used against us.\" He tossed the pistols and machetes toward the foot of the steps. Carole and Lacey did the same. He was most relieved to have the guns out of play. The b ullets hadn\u0027t affected him, but Carole and Lacey\u0027s lives had been on the lin e. \"A little help over here,\" Lacey said. Her voice sounded strained. Joe looked and saw that the woman had turned over and was trying to crawl o ut of her bed. Lacey was struggling to hold her back. Carole leaned in to h elp. As Joe moved toward the women, one of the guards rolled out of bed and land ed on the floor in front of him. Another to his right did the same. Both st arted a slow-motion bellycrawl toward their mistress. Joe stepped on the ba ck of the one in front of him and rejoined Carole and Lacey. \"They\u0027re coming for us!\" Lacey said, an edge of panic in her voice. She was clutching the woman\u0027s right arm while Carole held the left from the other si de of the bed. The woman writhed slowly in their grasp. \"Let\u0027s do this and g et the hell out of here!\" \"Yes, Joseph,\" Carole said, calm but grave. \"You haven\u0027t much time.\" \"All right, all right.\" Wasn\u0027t anything going to go according to plan? He grabbed the stake and maul. No hesitation this time. He placed the point of the stake over the woman\u0027s writhing chest, raised the maul - Lacey let out a yelp and released the woman\u0027s right arm. \"Something just t ouched - damn! There\u0027s one here on the floor! He\u0027s trying to grab my leg!\" She half turned and began kicking at the guard who\u0027d crawled to their feet. Joe stared in shock, then looked around. Others were on their way, inching toward them along the floor. This kind of loyalty and devotion was almost u nimaginable, especially in the undead. \"Joseph,\" Carole said. She had both the woman\u0027s arms now. \"Do it. Now.\" Joe nodded. In a single swift move he placed the stake and hammered it home. The heavy steel head of the maul drove the point all the way through the woman and into the mattress beneath. She writhed, kicked, spasmed, then sti ffened and lay still. Done. No time to waste. Move on. First get the guard by Lacey, and then - \"What the hell - ?\" Lacey said. Joe looked down. The guard at Lacey\u0027s feet was writhing on the floor. The ot her five were doing the same. This lasted maybe ten seconds, and then they l ay as still as their mistress. Lacey nudged one with the toe of her shoe. \"Dead. They\u0027re all__\" She looked up at Joe, her eyes wide. \"Unk! This is what happened the oth er night, right upstairs. A bunch of undead guards - supposedly they belon ged to someone named Gregor - they suddenly dropped dead, just like these guys. It was right after we heard a boom and ...\" She turned to Carole. \"You told u s you killed a vampire that night. Blew him to bits, right?\" \"Right. But I never knew his name.\" Lacey nodded. \"I\u0027ll bet it was Gregor. You killed him across town, and his g uards died upstairs in the Post Office. We killed this one, and her guards d ie a few seconds later. What\u0027s the connection? Is there some sort of spell t hat binds the guards to their masters? A life-and-death bond that connects t hem? Is that why they\u0027re so loyal?\" Memories of the Empire State Building flashed through Joe\u0027s head. \"When I mentioned to Franco how loyal his guards seemed, he told me it wasn\u0027t out of selflessness or personal regard for him - it was self-preservation.\" \"That was his word?\" Lacey said. \"Self-preservation? Well then that\u0027s it. Tha t\u0027s how they bind their guards to them: if their master dies, they die.\" Joe shook his head. \"I\u0027ve got a feeling it\u0027s something more than that. Franc o mentioned a secret. \u0027A momentous secret we keep only to ourselves,\u0027 he sai d. If only - \" Artemis! Joe whirled and looked at the cot in the corner where he\u0027d left t he vampire. Had he died too? But his bed was empty. Where - ? \"Look!\" Carole said, pointing her flashlight beam at a doorway where a pai r of legs were crawling through. \"Someone\u0027s there!\" Joe hurried over, grabbed both ankles, and hauled Artemis back into the do rmitory. He flipped him onto his back and stood over him. \"Not so fast, Artemis. We have some questions.\" \"Fuck you!\" His voice was barely audible. \"Why did the guards die when we killed the woman?\" The vampire sneered up at him and said nothing. Joe realized he had nothing to bargain with. Artemis knew he wasn\u0027t going t o walk away from this, so he had no reason to tell them anything. Lacey came up beside Joe and played her light over Artemis. \"Can we bring him upstairs?\" \"I suppose so,\" Joe said. \"But why?\" She looked at him. \"Sunlight.\" Joe glanced from her to Artemis and saw the fear in his single eye. Joe grab bed his feet again and dragged him toward the stairs. \"Good idea!\" \"No!\" Joe didn\u0027t have time for threats or deals. He hauled Artemis up feet first t o the main floor. The vampire twisted away from the light and flung his arms over his eyes. Joe found the brightness uncomfortable but it hadn\u0027t reached the intolerable point yet. Pulling Artemis upright, he grabbed him by the c ollar and belt and walked him toward the front doors. The sunlight blazed th rough the glass like burning phosphorous. \"Now\u0027s your chance, pal. Speak or burn. What\u0027s the big secret?\" \"Fuck you! I\u0027ll be just as dead either way!\" Damn him, he was right. And a dead vampire told no tales. He spun Artemis and shoved him into a shadowed corner where he curled into a whimpering ball. Carole and Lacey stood in the cellar doorway staring at Joe. \"Any ideas, or do we just finish him and get out of here?\" he said. Lacey stepped closer to Artemis. She spoke slowly, softly. \"Tossing him out i n the sun will kill him. But what if just a part of him gets in the sunlight? What will that do?\" \"Yes!\" Joe said. Finally - leverage. \"Anyone have a knife?\" Lacey whipped out a stainless steel pocketknife. \"My butterfly\u0027s gone, but th is should do. Someone tried to kill me with it.\" Joe unfolded the blade and began slicing at the legs of the vampire\u0027s pants below the knees. He remembered how this creature had ripped the clothes fr om him a few long nights ago. \"What goes around, comes around, right, Artemis?\" he said through his teeth. He pulled off Artemis\u0027s shoes, then moved around by his shoulders. \"All right, ladies. Grab his feet and we\u0027ll move his legs into that patch of sun light over there.\" \"No!\" Artemis wailed. \"Joseph,\" Carole said, giving him an unsettled look. \"Do we really - ?\" \"Please, Carole. Time\u0027s a-wasting, and this is one of the undead who manh andled me in New York.\" Artemis directed his one fear-filled eye at Joe. \"New York? Who - ?\" \"What? You don\u0027t recognize me? I\u0027m the priest Franco tried to turn the other night. Only he failed.\" \"But that\u0027s - that\u0027s impossible!\" Carole still hadn\u0027t moved. Lacey stepped in front of her. \"Let\u0027s go. I\u0027ll handle it.\" She grabbed Artemis by both ankles. His feeble kicks lacked the power to fr ee him. Together she and Joe dragged the lower half of his body into the li ght. Immediately his flesh started to smoke and blister. Lacey made a disgusted noise and released his ankles. His screams echoed through the building. \"Okay! Yes! Please! I\u0027ll tell! Anything you want! I\u0027ll tell! Please!\" Joe pulled him back into the shadows. Artemis lay in a heap, writhing, pant ing, and sobbing, his hands hovering over but never touching the blackened, still-smoking flesh of his lower legs. Sickened by the sight, Joe turned a way for a moment. He sensed Carole watching him but could not meet her eyes. Finally he turned back and forced himself to kneel beside the vampire. He poked him roughly on the shoulder. \"What\u0027s the secret, Artemis? Why did those guards die when we staked the woman?\" \"They were her get,\" he gasped. \"When she died, all her get died, not just he r guards.\" \"What\u0027s \u0027get\u0027?\" Lacey said. Artemis sneered. \"People she turned. When Olivia died, all of her get, no ma tter where they were in the world, died with her.\" Joe knelt there, stunned. \"I don\u0027t believe you.\" \"Believe it, priest. It\u0027s the one thing we don\u0027t want the living to know about u s.\" \"But you\u0027re telling me.\" His smile was sickly. \"What do I care? It won\u0027t matter to me, will it.\" \"You\u0027re telling me that anyone, anywhere, that she turned at anytime since she became undead, is now dead?\" \"Yes. That\u0027s the big secret. That\u0027s why Olivia\u0027s guards did everything to prot ect their get-mother. Not for her sake. For their own.\" Lacey squatted on the opposite side. \"But that means that somewhere there\u0027s a vampire who\u0027s the ultimate source of this whole undead plague. If some one could get to him - \" Artemis was shaking his head. \"No, cow. There may have been a single Prime millennia ago, but now there are many. We undead aren\u0027t immortal; it only s eems that way. We age and die, but we last many centuries. Eventually rot c atches up to everything, including us. It hits suddenly and over the course of a week or so we crumble to dust. But this kind of true death does not a ffect the get. In fact it enhances them. Only premature death kills one\u0027s g et. Because we lived solitary existences for so long, we never knew about g et-death. But when an ancient Prime figured it out, and started the practic e of protecting getfathers, our numbers began to grow.\" \"Is Franco a Prime?\" Joe asked. Artemis nodded. \"And my get-father.\" His eye narrowed. \"You want him, do n\u0027t you.\" \"Oh, yeah. If he goes, how many go with him?\" \"Many. I can\u0027t give you a definite number, but every Nosferatu in the Empire State Building is his get. Not in the city, however. We\u0027ve learned to mix g ets within a region to avoid catastrophe. I hope you get him.\" \"Why?\" \"I didn\u0027t want to come down here, but he made me. He hasn\u0027t treated me right since a certain unfortunate accident, and now, because of him, I\u0027m done. Ar en\u0027t I?\" He shifted his gaze to Lacey and Carole. \"You wouldn\u0027t consider . .. ?\" \"Not a chance,\" Lacey said. Joe held out his hand. \"Carole?\" \"Not a stake!\" Artemis whined. \"I don\u0027t want to be staked!\" Lacey made a face. \"You rather be thrown out in the sun?\" \"No! That\u0027s even worse! Look, can\u0027t you let me go? I\u0027ve helped you. I\u0027ve tol d you a valuable secret. I - \" Joe shook his head, as much to clear a creeping fog as to emphasize that surv ival was not one of Artemis\u0027s options. \"We\u0027ll give you a choice: sun or stake. That\u0027s all you\u0027ve got.\" \"There\u0027s another way,\" Carole said. Joe looked up and saw her fishing something that looked like a candle out o f the front of her sweatshirt. He seemed to be viewing her through a mist. The waxy stick had wires attached. She bent and placed it under Artemis\u0027s n eck, then draped a wire over each of his shoulders. \"This is a high explosive,\" she said. \"You won\u0027t feel a thing.\" High explosive? Had she wired herself to explode? He wanted to ask but th e words wouldn\u0027t come. \"Just take the two wires ...\" Carole was saying. He watched Artemis reach up and take a wire in each hand. \"... and touch them - \" \"Fuck you all!\" Artemis cried as he jammed the two wires together. Joe managed to raise a leaden arm across his eyes and fall back - - but nothing happened. Carole looked down at Artemis, her expression a mask of dismay. \"You didn\u0027t let me finish.\" She held up a battery. \"You touch the wires to opposite ends of this.\" She shook her head. \"Your kind simply don\u0027t underst and mercy or compassion, do you.\" \"Damn right they don\u0027t,\" Lacey said. Joe saw that she held the maul and a stake in her hands. Before Artemis coul d react, she jabbed the point over his heart and slammed it home with two qu ick, hard strikes. The vampire arched his back, shuddered, then crumpled. Lacey pulled the explosive stick from behind Artemis\u0027s neck and handed it back to Carole. \"They don\u0027t deserve a break. Any of them.\" Joe was still half sitting, half lying on the floor. He tried to rise but hadn\u0027t the strength. He felt as if someone had pulled the plug on his energy. \"Something\u0027s wrong,\" he croaked. \"I can barely move.\" Carole looked at her watch. \"Dear Lord! It\u0027s past your time!\" Joe fought the lethargy stealing through him. Too tired to worry. It was all he could do to hold his head up. The world around him became a blur. He was dimly aware of voices mentioning\"back door\" and \"employee entrance\" and \"bring the car around.\" He felt hims elf dragged-carried outside into a shady area that was still blindingly brig ht, then lifted and folded into a small space ... a slam that sounded like a car trunk lid, then darkness.. . blessed darkness.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/midnight-mass/page-10.html","bookId":2552,"book":{"id":2552,"title":"Midnight Mass","description":"Storyline: Vampires have always lived in Eastern Europe. But with the fall of the Soviet Union, they began to spread across the continent, then the world, turning whole populations into vampires--or human cattle. Having overrun India, the far East, and the great cities of North and South America, the forces of Night are now spreading into the countryside to consolidate their conquest. In a town on the New Jersey shore, the vampires have just arrived, along with their human henchmen, the cowboys, who round up human cattle for the overlords in return for the promise of eternal life---later.

Falsely accused of abuse, Father Joe is drunk in a basement waiting for the end. His superior has betrayed the local Catholic congregation and become a vampire. Sister Carole has become a formidable killer of cowboys and vampires. Dan\u0027s niece, escaped from the conquest of New York, has made her way south to find him.

Against all odds, they discover that there just might be a way for humanity to really fight back.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/midnight-mass.jpg","author":"F.
