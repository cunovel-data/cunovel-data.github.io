{"id":25526,"no":1,"title":"PREFATORY INTRODUCTION.","content":"PREFATORY INTRODUCTION. \\n\\n BY THE HISTORIOGRAPHER \\n\\n \\n\\n In the following record of the explorations of the Teutonic corps of the R. H. B. Society of Berlin, dispatched for the classification of parasitical animalcul? peculiar to the vegetable productions of the tropics, I shall confine myself exclusively to the revelations of the day until the culmination of the corps discoveries, and then to Manatitlan dictation, either direct or through the medium of thought dictation. \\n\\n \\n\\n The discoveries, as verified, will undoubtedly tax “public credulity” to its utmost stretch; but as the absorptive power of human instinct for the marvelous is unlimited in its superstitious gullibility, it will peradventure receive—with perhaps an awkward spasm from the novelty of goodness—the practical experience adduced as worthy of disputatious consideration. Still we feel assured that there is a reasonable minority who will adopt the practical suggestions with joyful avidity. The facts related—although at present stranger than the instinctive fictions projected from the unreason of the stomach’s rule—will prove, to the affectionately disposed, of easy reconciliation with healthy digestion, and in vievery respect worthy of universal adoption by our race. Assuming the privilege of narrative relation in recording the progressive events, I shall only advert to the leading adventures of the scientific corps while en route toward their ultimate field of exploitation. But while in progress shall endeavor to render the characteristic peculiarities of the members sufficiently conspicuous for the clear exposition of their national traits, that the reader may realize the obstacles opposed, in degree, to their assimilation with the practical teachings of the Manatitlans demonstrated by Heraclean example. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucenhouck, in prophetic forecast, says, “Man, in the arrogance of his pride, believes that he is of a race separate and distinct from the lower orders of the animal creation. Assuming attributes of deity he has constituted himself arbitrator of his own destiny. Yet, with all his affectation of superiority, there is an approximation in his form and physical conformation that distinctly declares his relationship to the simia species; among which there is as great a variety in form and racial intelligence as with those of the genus to which he stands confessed. With the full development of microscopical power, future generations will learn that the wonders of Creation are beyond present conception, and that well defined organic humanity may yet be revealed on the utmost verge of atomic divisibility.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1802/52319.html","bookId":1052,"book":{"id":1052,"title":"The Manatitlans","description":"简介： In the following record of the explorations of the Teutonic corps of the R.
