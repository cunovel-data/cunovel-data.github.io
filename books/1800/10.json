Phil laughs and cuts up his chicken. “Oh, you haven’t been so bad. We are all going to miss you, I know that. Aren’t we, girls?” Both Megan and Janet agree, and I just smile as I eat my dinner. I know one pussy in this house is going to miss my bedtime stories, but I’m thinking we’ll find a way to still make that happen. “So, honey, have you decided about college yet? I know we keep bringing it up, but you’ve gotten all these acceptance letters and you’re graduating in four months. You really need to decide what you want to do.” I pause, my fork halfway to my mouth, as I look at Megan for her response. I can’t imagine her wanting to leave for college after what we’ve shared, but if she decides to go, I guess I’ll just have to follow her. It’s crazy how fast your priorities can change. She tucks her hair behind her ear and looks away from her mom and dad. “I’m not sure yet. I don’t think I’m ready to go. I’m graduating early, but I want to leave my options open for now until I decide what I want to do.” Phil reaches over, patting her hand until she looks up at him. “I completely understand, honey. I didn’t know what I wanted to do until I was already halfway through college and had to change majors. I wasted two years of time and money on something because my parents pushed me into it. You mom and I want you to be happy, so think about it, and when you’re ready, we can decide. You’re a smart girl, and we trust you’ll figure it out.” “When I was your age, I just wanted to have babies and be a stay-at-home mom,” Janet sighs wistfully, looking over at Phil, and I nearly choke on my beer. “I wish we could have had a dozen babies, my love,” Phil says, and they smile at one another. “Luckily we were able to have one, and she turned out to be enough of a pain in the ass for a dozen.” We all laugh, and Megan’s cheeks burn with embarrassment. Phil mentioned that Janet had to have a hysterectomy after giving birth to Megan. Something about complications with bleeding. Phil had almost lost both of them. I look at Megan and feel my heart ache. I can’t imagine losing her. I know that when she gets pregnant, I’ll make every doctor monitor her in case that problem should arise with her too. Megan gives me a look, and I see it there in her eyes. Need. She wants that too. She wants to be bred. She wants to give me babies. I feel my cock swell under the table as I think about sinking inside of her again. It’s been less than an hour, but I don’t know how much longer I can wait. “Maybe after dinner I can show Megan where my new place is. You guys have already seen it. It’s only fair she gets to see it too.” Janet beams. “That’s a great idea, Chris. You being here has been so great for Megan. She’s normally in her room all the time with her nose stuck in a book. You’ve really opened her up.” If she only knew. “Oh fuck, I’m so close but we’re almost there.” Megan pulls back from my cock and smiles at me from the passenger seat. “You can’t come in my mouth. That would be wasteful.” She said she wanted to tease me, and did that and more. As soon as we were out of the driveway, she leaned over the gear stick and undid my pants. Thankfully, the route to my house included some back roads, so we were safe. As she sucks my cock, I reach back and put a finger in her ass. I just need to get inside every part of her. I want all her young holes stretched only for me. I pull into my driveway and park in the garage. I look over at Megan, and put my finger in my mouth to suck it clean. Her eyes get big and her face goes bright red. “There’s not a part of you that isn’t sweet, baby girl.” I lean in and kiss her softly on the cheek. “Get out, baby.” It’s dark out, but we’re in the garage, and I don’t have any close neighbors. I get out and shut my door, going around to meet her. I grab her up and pin her to the side of the SUV. I can’t wait any longer. I don’t get the keys to the place until tomorrow, but I don’t need to take her inside. This is going to be hard and fast, and I can do that right here. Megan is wearing loose cut-off jean shorts and a baggy tank top that has a Stormtrooper on it and it reads, ‘I love a man in uniform’. She’s so fucking cute I can’t stand it. I love that she embraces what she loves, no matter what people might think. Some would see her as a nerd, but I see her as someone who loves what she loves, not caring what people think. I have her pinned to the side of my car, my face in her neck as I bite and suck, leaving another mark for that Croy motherfucker to see. He can tell anybody he wants he did it, but that little shit knows good and well she’s claimed. Someone else is getting her sweet cunt, not him. Not ever. I pull back and spin her around. “Put your hands on the hood, baby. I need to get off. You got me so worked up with that sweet mouth of yours, it’s gonna take me two seconds to nut.” “Just cum inside me, Chris. I don’t need to get off, but just make sure you get it all in there.” “Oh, you’ll get off.” I push her shorts down to her knees, and lift the back of her tank so I can see all of her ass. I unbutton my jeans and pull out my cock, already leaking and ready. She leans forward over the hood and sticks her ass out for me. I lube my cock at her opening, seeing that she’s soaked and ready too. Her horny cunt sucks me in slick and easy, without any resistance. I grab her hips with both hands and start to fuck her hard.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/coach-breeding-1/page-10.html","bookId":1800,"book":{"id":1800,"title":"Coach (Breeding #1)","description":"Storyline: Retiring from the NFL was the right decision, and at thirty years old, I\u0027ve done things most people could only dream of.
