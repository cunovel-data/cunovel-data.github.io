That’s all it takes, just the slightest touch, and I start to cum. I feel my pussy gripping him as he pounds into me from behind. The desk scoots across the floor from the force of his thrusts, and I’m cumming hard. I’m doing just as he asked and milking his cock. I feel his warm release splash into my body as he drops down onto my back, kissing my neck. His final twitches inside me are a sweet feeling as he whispers against my skin. “Thank you, baby.” “I think I should be thanking you.” I let out a giggle, and he leans back, pulling out of me. I feel him drop down, and he’s between my legs, pulling my panties the rest of the way down. “Love the skirt. Step out.” He indicates for me to lift my foot so he can pull them all the way off. “Don’t move, let me clean you.” Using my panties, he wipes between my legs while I watch him over my shoulder. I wait for him to tell me to step back into them, but when he doesn’t, I turn around and watch him put them in his pocket “For luck tonight.” He smiles, and I feel myself blush. How I could possibly still have anything left to blush about, I don’t know. Chris stands up, fixes his pants, and then he straightens my skirt. “Stay away from him, Megan.” I don’t have to ask who he’s talking about. “Stay away from her!” It’s a bratty comeback but I don’t care. “Who?” He legitimately looks confused, and it just adds to my irritation. “Miss Big Boobs, Kim Heart.” “She has tits?” I hate it, but his comment makes me smile, and then it turns into a laugh. He comes over to me, wrapping me up in a hug, and I nuzzle into him, wishing we could get out of here. “I won’t let you pretend to be with someone else just because we can’t be together yet.” “I know.” “Now go home and get ready for the game tonight. I need to see you in the stands, cheering me on.” I nod my head, and he leans down to kiss me. Feeling his warm lips against mine has me ready for more, but we don’t have time, and this isn’t exactly the best location. I’ll just have to do what we’ve been doing. Wait. 6 Chris We took down the Badgers in a blowout. I was nervous about it all coming together, but thankfully it turned out all right. The boys performed better than I expected, and I was right to push them so hard. There were scouts in the stands after the media came to film my first game. I even saw a few of my old coaches walking around and taking notes. It takes a couple of hours after the game to talk to everyone and have the locker room speech with the players. Afterwards I have to do some handshakes with the news and a few boosters to talk about the upcoming season. Overall, it’s a lot more politics than I bargained for, but it is what it is. I guess if I want to continue to coach, this side is the bullshit I have to deal with. The worst part about tonight was having to do an interview and having to watch helplessly as Croy went up to Megan after the game and put his hands on her. I had a news camera and a microphone in my face, so I kept it together. He reached out to touch her, but she just stood there with her arms crossed. Her big tits were perched on top of her folded arms, making them look obscene, and I’m sure that’s why Croy was hanging around. Phil and Janet were close by, and they looked like they were having a chummy conversation with him too. That fucking kid makes my blood boil, and I’m pissed off that there isn’t shit I can do about it while I’m his coach. I made it through the interview without incident, and as I walked past them to the locker room, Megan and I locked eyes. Her parents were so wrapped up in their conversation with Croy they didn’t see me signal to Megan to check her phone. When I get to my office, I grab my phone and text her. ME: TELL YOUR PARENTS YOU’RE STAYING WITH A FRIEND TONIGHT. MEGAN: WHAT FRIEND? ME: DOESN’T MATTER. TELL THEM I’LL GIVE YOU A RIDE SINCE IT’S NEAR MY HOUSE. I’LL DROP YOU OFF TOMORROW TOO BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO BACK AND GET MY STUFF. MEGAN: SO YOU AND ME ALL ALONE TONIGHT? ME: IF YOU TELL THAT FUCKER TO KEEP HIS HANDS OFF YOU. MEGAN: MEET YOU AT YOUR CAR XOXO \u003c3 I toss my phone in my bag and head out. I’m irritated, even though this should be a great night. Maybe it’s just different being on this side of things. When I was a player, the celebration started after the game, but it seems like I can’t get away from people wanting to do interviews and parents wanting to ask about playing time. All I want to do is get Megan and go home so I can sink inside her in peace. I got the keys for my new place from the builder this morning, but Megan still hasn’t seen the inside. I plan on showing her every square foot after I get her out of here. The thought causes me to smile, and as I’m not paying attention, I almost run right into Kim. “Hey, Coach Burns. Great win out there tonight.” “Thanks.” I start to sidestep her, but she follows me. “Listen, I know you said you’ve got to move tomorrow, but what about a celebratory drink tonight? I promise I know how to show you a good time, you know, you being new in town and all.” I look over her shoulder and see Megan standing there with her family and Croy. She’s pissed, and I am too. We’ve got to get away from all this shit. “Kim, I appreciate the offer, but I’m not interested. I have a standing policy to never date coworkers, and I’m sorry if I gave you any impression otherwise.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/coach-breeding-1/page-14.html","bookId":1800,"book":{"id":1800,"title":"Coach (Breeding #1)","description":"Storyline: Retiring from the NFL was the right decision, and at thirty years old, I\u0027ve done things most people could only dream of.

She\u0027s a student, she\u0027s barely legal, and she\u0027s my best friend’s daughter. I didn\u0027t know what desire was until Megan. I had no idea obsession could drive someone insane, until I saw her. I wasn\u0027t prepared for the fact that once I laid eyes on Megan my life would really begin. I have to have her, no matter what the cost. I have to breed her and bind her to me so tightly she can\u0027t ever get away. She\u0027ll be mine, even if I have to take her.
