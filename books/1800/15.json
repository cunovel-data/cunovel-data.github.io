I go over to everyone waiting for me. I speak to Croy first. He’s my biggest problem, and I need to get rid of him.\n “Hey, Chris, congratulations on the win!” Janet beats me to the punch and gives me a hug. I can’t help but smile. She would have made a great cheerleader. She’s beaming with pride.\n “Looks like you did an outstanding job of coaching our star quarterback as well.” Phil pats Croy on the back, and I try not to roll my eyes. He fucked up no less than a dozen plays tonight, but luckily my o-line is strong and saved the day.\n “Yeah,” is all I can manage to say as Croy beams, clearly taking the credit. It’s a big win for him, and I don’t want to cheat him out of it. But that kid needs some work if he wants to play college ball.\n “So, Megan said you’re going to be able to give her a ride tonight.”\n I nearly choke on my own spit at Janet’s question, but I just nod and smile.\n “Yeah, Mom. Coach said it was on the way to his new place, and then he could just bring me back in the morning when he comes to get the last of his stuff.”\n “Okay, sounds perfect, as long as he doesn’t mind. Your car is still in the shop getting new tires.” Janet looks at her phone distractedly. “You’ll just need to be back before noon so you can get your hair done for the dance.”\n “You’re going?” The words come out as an accusation. Croy answers, which just pisses me off further.\n “Yes, we finally worked out the details. I’m going to meet up with some of the guys tonight.” He turns, looking at Megan expectantly, and she just nods her head at him. “Okay, I’ll pick you up at five tomorrow. We can do dinner before.”\n Megan’s eyes go wide, but she doesn’t respond. Phil turns to Croy and shakes his hand, telling him he did a good job tonight. I give him a chin lift, and he heads out, leaving the four of us.\n “All right, husband, we’re kid-free tonight. Let’s go get wild.”\n “You mean ice cream, don’t you?”\n “You got it.”\n After Phil and Janet leave, I walk to my car, Megan trailing behind me. I hear her quick footsteps trying to keep up, and it’s all I can do not to turn around and throw her over my shoulder. I’m aggravated, pissed off, and horny. Not a good combination.\n I climb in the SUV and wait for Megan to get in and close the door. I crank it up and pull out of the parking lot, waving to people as we leave. Once we are away from school and on the road, I grip the steering wheel with both hands.\n “So you’re going with Croy? After I just said you needed to stay away from him?”\n “He put me on the spot in front of my parents. What was I supposed to say? ‘Sorry I have a boyfriend, and oh look, here he comes now. You guys might recognize him.’ No. My mom jumped at the chance for me to go to a dance. She wanted me to experience the last part of my high school years, and I guess that included Homecoming. You act like I had a choice.”\n I know she’s right, but I can’t think clearly when it comes to her. “Fuck.” It’s the only thing I can say. I feel like an asshole for putting us both in this position, but we’re stuck, and I can’t claim her out in the open. Yet.\n “Show me your pussy.”\n “What?”\n “You heard me, Megan. Pull your skirt up and show me your cunt. Let me see what’s mine.”\n I see her shaky fingers go her hem as she scoots her ass to the end of the seat. She pulls it up, spreading her legs wide. I can’t help myself. I reach over.\n “Spread your lips for me.”\n When she does, I rub two fingers over her wet clit, and then sink them deep inside her. I finger-fuck her for a few minutes, and then pull them out, licking them clean. Fuck, I love the taste of her teenage cunt.\n “Let me see your tits too.”\n “Chris.” She sounds shy, but I need it.\n “Show me, Megan. Now.”\n She lifts her shirt and pulls down the soft cups of her bra, letting her big tits bounce free. I reach over, pinching one hard nipple, and then the other. I want my mouth on them so bad, but I’ll have to wait a little longer.\n I reach down and undo my khakis, pulling my cock out. “Come suck me off before we get home. I want you too much right now, and I won’t last.”\n She crawls over to me, leaning over the center console, and starts sucking me right away. Feeling her hot little mouth on my dick is heaven. She’d never sucked a dick before mine, and fuck if that doesn’t make me love it more. She said she watched instructional videos on it, wanting to make it good for me. It’s working all right, because she gives the best head I’ve ever had. She reaches down, stroking my shaft down to my balls and teasing back up as she twirls her tongue around the head. Her warm wet mouth sucks and licks, begging for my cum. I pull over on a back road and grab her hair with both hands, pulling it back out of the way for her while she gets me off.\n I cum hard and fast, and goddamn, her sweet little mouth sucks it all down. “Oh God, baby. The best. Best.”\n I breathe heavily as she sits back against the passenger door, spreading her legs wide for me. Seeing her glistening pussy and how she got off on sucking me makes me start leaking cum all over again. I’ll never get enough of her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/coach-breeding-1/page-15.html","bookId":1800,"book":{"id":1800,"title":"Coach (Breeding #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Retiring from the NFL was the right decision, and at thirty years old, I\u0027ve done things most people could only dream of.
