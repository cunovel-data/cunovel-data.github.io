{"id":1800,"title":"Coach (Breeding #1)","description":"Storyline: Retiring from the NFL was the right decision, and at thirty years old, I\u0027ve done things most people could only dream of. After all I\u0027ve accomplished, coaching high school football should be easy...but when you\u0027ve got a distraction in the form of a nerdy girl with curves, things can get complicated. She\u0027s a student, she\u0027s barely legal, and she\u0027s my best friendâ€™s daughter. I didn\u0027t know what desire was until Megan. I had no idea obsession could drive someone insane, until I saw her. I wasn\u0027t prepared for the fact that once I laid eyes on Megan my life would really begin. I have to have her, no matter what the cost. I have to breed her and bind her to me so tightly she can\u0027t ever get away. She\u0027ll be mine, even if I have to take her. Warning: this book is ridiculous, over the top, completely unbelievable, and pretty much just about breeding the heroine. If you\u0027re okay with that, welcome to my dirty, dirty book! Just remember, I warned you.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/coach-breeding-1.jpg","author":"Alexa Riley","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":20,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
