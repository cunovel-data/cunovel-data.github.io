{"id":25502,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IV. Breaking Cover.","content":"Miss Grace Lambert! Who was she? The programme, of course, told nothing but her name, and when Miles Challoner turned to his companion for the purpose of inquiring further, he saw that his brows were knit, and his lips tightly clenched. Miles looked at Lord Sandilands in surprise, but forbore to question him. It was evident that the people in his immediate vicinity were equally unable to assuage his curiosity, as they were all talking and chattering together, and throwing glances towards the occupant of the platform, who stood totally unmoved. Then Sir Purcell Arne, looking round with a half-anxious, half-triumphant air, gave the customary three taps on his desk, and with a wave of his baton led the orchestra into the prelude. It was a simple English air--very simple--with a pathetic refrain, and out from the harmonious ensemble of the musicians came a soft sweet bird-like voice, beginning mellowly and low, then rising into a clear pure treble, a volume of lark-like utterance, a continuous ripple of sound, such as is seldom heard in human voice. Few notes had been uttered before their effect became visible on the whole assemblage--amongst the foreigners first; on the back benches, where were gathered the hirsute professionals honoured with the entrée to Lady Carabas\u0027 concerts, there was an immediate movement, a simultaneous pricking of ears and elevation of eyebrows, culminating into a general impossible-to-be-suppressed \"A--h!\" of intense delight. Then the enthusiasm spread. Impressible young girls with the nil-admirari breeding scarcely yet habitual to them, looked timidly towards their chaperones, as though pleading, \"For Heaven\u0027s sake, let us for one moment be natural, and give vent to the delight with which this girl has inspired us.\" Said chaperones, with some faint reminiscence of nature unbusked and unsteeled by conventionality, sought relief in faintly tapping their kidded palms with their fans. Old boys, dragged away from after-dinner maps, or cosy house-dinners at the clubs, to do family duty, and expecting nothing but driest musical classicalities, expressed their gratitude in strident \"bravas.\" Even the gilded youth of the period, surprised out of its usual inanity into a feeble semblance of life and earnestness, condescended to express its opinion of the singer, that she was not \"half bad, don\u0027t you know?\" And its component members inquired of each other, \"who the devil is she?\" On Lady Carabas\u0027 handsome face the hard-set look of anxiety had softened into the blandest smile of triumph; old Sir Purcell Arne\u0027s blond moustache bristled with delight; and at the conclusion of the ballad, when the singer, rising to the occasion, had sent a flood of melody surging through the room, now dying away in softest trills and most harmonious cadences, the enthusiasm could no longer be restrained, and amidst sonorous applause breaking forth from every side, the amateur instrumentalists leading the van, and Lady Carabas herself, regardless of appearances or of the value of three-buttoned gloves, clapping her hands with the ardour of the most zealous member of a professional claque,--Miss Grace Lambert, perfectly composed, and with the slightest bow in recognition of her triumph, laid her fingers daintily on Sir Purcell Arne\u0027s tremblingly-proffered arm, and disappeared from public view. Ten minutes\u0027 interval now, much needed. Impossible, after such a display, to keep the coterie quiet, and it breaks up at once into twenty little knots, all with the same refrain of praise, differently expressed: \"Das ist aber\u0027was Sch?nes!\" \"Tiens, tiens, Jules! v\u0027là donc un rossignol charmant!\" \"That\u0027s what I call good singing, for an Englishwoman, that is, Veluti! Capisco, signor!\" \"Tell you what it is, old fella; since poor Bosio, you know, never heard anything like that, don\u0027t you know?\" \"It\u0027s A1, don\u0027t you know?\" Frank testimonies these, from the male sex; chiming in with \"Dearest Lady Carabas, O, how I congratulate you! Where did you find such a treasure? Charmin\u0027, quite charmin\u0027; so ladylike, and all that kind of thing. Quite a nice-looking person, too!\" from the female portion of the audience. She had vanished, and Miles Challoner remained mute and dazed. Of beauty he had always had a keen appreciation--that is, beauty as he understood it--showing itself in tolerable regularity of feature, in grace and aristocratic tournure. Red-and-white women, were they duchesses or dairymaids--and it must be owned that when Nature alone is depended upon they are generally the latter--found no favour in Miles\u0027s eyes. He used to say he liked a \"bred\"-looking woman; and here was one who, so far as appearance went, might have been a Plantagenet. And her voice--good Heavens!--was there ever heard anything so completely enthralling! The blood yet danced in his veins with the delight excited when that low tremulous utterance, gradually rising into trills of lark-like melody, first stole upon his ear. No wonder that all in the room were talking loudly in her praise. All? No. Rapt in his own delight, Miles had forgotten to speak to Lord Sandilands, to whom he partly owed the pleasure he had just experienced, and he turned to repair his neglect. Lord Sandilands was sitting \"quiet as a stone.\" He had recovered his gloves, and his long shapely white hands were tightly clasped together on his knee. Despite the tight clasp, the hands twitched nervously, and on the old man\u0027s well-cut features Miles noticed a worn pinched look, such as he had never before observed. Lord Sandilands\u0027 eyes, too, were downcast, and he did not raise them even when Miles addressed him. \"Was there ever anything so charming as that young lady?\" \"She has a very sweet voice.\" \"Sweet! it is perfectly entrancing! I had no idea such sounds could be produced by human throat; and then her appearance so thoroughly ladylike, and such an exquisite profile! Why, even you, who go in so strictly for the classical, must have been satisfied with the profile!\" \"I scarcely observed her.\" \"Scarcely observed her! Why, my dear old friend, that is very unlike your usual habit when a pretty woman is in question, unless, indeed, you were so enthralled by her voice that you cared for nothing else.\" \"Ye-es; that was it, I suppose--I--\" The conversation was interrupted by the return of the other guests, who, summoned by Sir Purcell Arne\u0027s preliminary taps, came back to their seats to hear the rest of the concert. All rustle and talk and chatter still. \"Never was anything like it. I\u0027m sure I can\u0027t tell where you pick up these wonderful people, dear Lady Carabas. And what comes next, dear Lady Carabas? O, now we\u0027re to have Mr. Wisk\u0027s operetta--for the first time; never was played anywhere before. You know Ferdinand Wisk? clever creature! there he is, comin\u0027 to conduct it himself. Sh-h!\" That clever creature, Mr. Ferdinand Wisk, who was supposed to be a scion of the aristocracy, but whose real mission in life seemed to be to devote himself to the affairs, public and private, of every member of the musical world, English or foreign, advanced rapidly through the room, and took the baton which Sir Purcell handed to him amidst general applause. Mr. Wisk\u0027s operetta needs but little mention here; it was bright and sparkling, and would have been more original if the overture had not been cribbed from Auber, and the concerted pieces from Offenbach; but as it was, it did remarkably well, affording opportunities for two young ladies and two young gentlemen to sing very much out of tune; for the funny man of the company to convulse the audience with his drolleries; and for the audience generally to repay themselves for their silence during Miss Grace Lambert\u0027s ballad, by chatting without stint. Perhaps the only two persons in the room who did not avail themselves of this opportunity were Lord Sandilands and Miles Challoner. The former, having glanced at the programme, and noticed that Miss Lambert\u0027s name did not appear again therein, made a half-muttered apology to Lady Carabas about the \"heat,\" and left the room very shortly after the commencement of Mr. Wisk\u0027s performance; while the latter could not shake off the spell which held him, and which, during all the comic gentleman\u0027s funniments and all the others\u0027 bad singing, gave but Grace Lambert\u0027s voice to his ears, her face and figure to his eyes. To supper now, foreigners first,--making great running and leaving everyone else far behind; leaping on to edibles and dashing at potables with such vigour as to cause one to think they had not dined, as indeed many of them had not. And now, more congratulation amongst visitors, more \"Did you evers?\" a perfect whirlwind of \"Don\u0027t you knows?\" and \"only to think of dear Lady Carabas being so fortunate, and such a wonderful acquisition even to her set!\" Ferdinand Wisk, a little depressed at being thrown into the background by the superior attractions of Miss Lambert; and the funny man of the company feeling himself not sufficiently appreciated, and thirsting for Miss Lambert\u0027s blood--both, however, consoled by old Piccolo, the fashionable music-master, who is popularly supposed to have been allied with Auber and Offenbach in writing Mr. Wisk\u0027s operetta, and who tells them that Miss Lambert\u0027s triumph is a mere succès d\u0027estime, and that she will \"go out like that--pouf!\" Piccolo snapping his fingers and blowing out an imaginary candle in explanation. Foreigners having been fed, and a proper quantity of champagne and seltzer-water having been duly drunk, it enters into the minds of some of the younger guests that dancing would be a pleasant pastime for the remainder of the night, such exercise being sometimes permitted at the concerts, when Lady Carabas is in specially good temper, which is the case to-night apparently, for servants are instructed to clear the concert-room, a band is improvised, and the floor is soon covered with whirling couples. On these dancers Miles Challoner stood gazing with an abstracted air. At the conclusion of the concert he had moved with the rest, and on passing Lady Carabas had addressed to her a few words of compliment on the success of her evening; words which, although Miles did not remark it, were pleasantly received, for though Lady Carabas had come to that time of life when she was called an \"old thing\" by very young ladies, the epithet having \"dear\" or \"horrid,\" according to the speaker\u0027s tastes, attached to it, she still delighted in the admiration of men if they were clever or handsome, and purred under their praises with ineffable satisfaction. Whether Miles Challoner was clever, Lady Carabas had yet to learn; but she knew that he was undeniably handsome, and that he was a credit to her evening. Many other people in the rooms had thought so too; and though strange faces were more frequently seen at Carabas House than in any other frequented by the same set, Miles\u0027s tall figure and frank face had excited a certain amount of languid curiosity, and the \"new importation,\" as he was called by people who had been twice to the house, made a very favourable first impression. He was not the least conscious of it, though, nor, had he been, would he have particularly cared. When Lord Sandilands\u0027 brougham drew up under the portico of Carabas House, when Miles, after climbing up the staircase,--a unit in the throng of pretty women and distinguished men,-was presented to Lady Carabas, the young man felt that he was entering on a new and entrancing sphere of life, in which he was henceforth to move; and his thoughts, in the little time he allowed himself for thinking, were of a roseate hue. He had sufficient money to live easily with those people amongst whom Lord Sandilands\u0027 introduction would give him position, and place him at his ease. Emerging from the dull country-squire life to which he at first had imagined himself relegated, he should now mix on excellent footing with that society which he had always thought of with envy, but never thoroughly comprehended. In a word, when Sir Purcell Arne left the room for the purpose of fetching the new singer, there was not in England, perhaps, at that moment, a more thoroughly happy young man than Miles Challoner. But ever since Grace Lambert\u0027s voice had fallen on his ear, he had been a different man. As he listened to her, as he gazed upon her handsome face and elegant figure, he sat enthralled, spell-bound by her charm. And when she had gone, her voice remained ringing in his ears, her face and figure remained before his eyes, while a total change--to him entirely unaccountable--had come over his thoughts. What had sent his mind wandering back to the early days of his childhood? What had suddenly brought to his recollection his brother Geoffrey as he last saw him, a bright, bold, daring boy, persistent in carrying through whatever might be uppermost in his mind, and undeterred by fear of his tutor, or even of his stern father? He had just decided with delight upon the course of life which he would pursue in future; but now he wondered whether he had decided rightly, Ought he not, in his position as head of the Challoner family, to live down at the old place, as all his forefathers, save his uncle Howard, who was universally hated, had done? Was it not his bounden duty to be there, ready, when called upon, to give advice and assistance to his tenantry and poorer neighbours? And that thought of Geoffrey! Ought he not, even in spite of all his father had said, to have taken some steps to trace his brother\u0027s career from the time of his leaving home, at all events to endeavour to ascertain the reason of the fatal sentence of banishment which had been pronounced against him? Ought he not--and then he found himself wondering what connection Miss Grace Lambert\u0027s voice and face had with these thoughts, and then he roused himself from the reverie into which he had fallen, and things material took their proper shapes and forms to his eyes: he returned from the dim past to the bright present--from the play-room at Rowley Court to the ball-room of Carabas House. It was getting rather late now for the outer world and common people in general, but not for Carabas House, where the meaning of the word was unknown. The great hall-porter in his younger and slimmer days must have served his apprenticeship as boots at a railway hotel, the only position in which he could have acquired his faculty of sleeplessness. Men constantly spent what they were pleased to call the early part of the evening at Carabas House, went on to other balls which they \"saw out,\" and returned, certain to find \"someone left.\" The latest lounger at Pratt\u0027s, the most devoted attendant at the Raleigh, knew that during the season he should always be able to get his glass of sherry and seltzer in Beaumanoir-square, no matter what time of night it might be. The linkman, whose light had long since paled its ineffectual fire and gone out, seldom left before the milkman arrived, and the pair interchanged confidence about the house and its owners, as is the custom of such people. The dancing was not quite so animated as when Miles had last looked at it. Careful men who called themselves seven-and-twenty, and who were really five-and-thirty, mindful of all the outing they had before them during the season, had gone home to bed. Those who remained were very young men, and very determined girls, whose wearing chaperones sat blinking round the room, or solaced themselves with stabbing each other, and tearing to pieces the reputation of their common friends, on the landing. But Lady Carabas was not with these; she was standing at the far end of the room, surrounded by half-a-dozen men, with whom she was holding an animated conversation. One of them, to whom she appeared to pay particular attention, had his back turned to Miles, but seemed to be young and of a slight wiry figure. Miles noticed this man specially, partly from the evident enjoyment which Lady Carabas took in his conversation, and partly from a peculiarity in his appearance, so far as it could be gathered from a back-view, in the horsey cut of his clothes, and the slang attitude, rounded shoulders, and hands plunged deep into his trousers-pockets, in which he stood conversing with his hostess. Miles had not noticed this gentleman before, and was wondering who he was, when a valsing couple, looking tired and out of breath, stopped immediately in front of him. \"That was a grand spin,\" said the gentleman; \"the room\u0027s splendid just now. Got rid of all those awful people who can\u0027t dance a bit, don\u0027t you know? and do nothing but get in your way. You\u0027re in great feather to-night, Miss Grenville.\" \"Thanks very much,\" said the young lady, \"a compliment from you is quite the most charming thing possible; perhaps because it\u0027s so rare, Mr. Ashleigh.\" \"\u0027Gad, I don\u0027t know!\" replied the gentleman, who was two-and-twenty years of age, and who might have been two-and-sixty for calm self-possession and savoir faire, \"I\u0027m rather a good hand at saying nice things, I think.\" \"When you don\u0027t mean them, perhaps?\" \"No, no. Now you\u0027re down upon me too sharp, Miss Grenville; \u0027pon my word you are; and I can never say anything, nice or not nice, at this time of night. Let\u0027s finish the valse.\" \"I\u0027m afraid I must not stay any longer, Mr. Ashleigh! Really, it\u0027s quite too cruel to poor mamma; and we\u0027ve two dances to-morrow night that we must go to. Besides, Lady Carabas is dying to get rid of us.\" \"Don\u0027t look as if she was, does she, Miss Grenville? Laughing away; look at her. Wonderful woman, Lady Carabas!\" \"Who is the gentleman she is talking to?\" \"That? O, that\u0027s a man that\u0027s everywhere about.\" \"I\u0027m as wise as I was before. What is his name? where does he come from?\" \"His name! \u0027pon my word, Miss Grenville, I forget. I\u0027ll go and ask him, if you like. Ah, I know he\u0027s a great friend of Ticehurst\u0027s. You know Ticehurst?\" \"I have met Lord Ticehurst.\" \"Met him! O ah, yes; always know what ladies mean when they say they\u0027ve \u0027met\u0027 anybody; mean they hate \u0027em. Well, if you don\u0027t like Ticehurst, I don\u0027t think you\u0027d like that man; they\u0027re very much alike, specially Pompey, don\u0027t you know? Bad egg, and that kind of thing.\" \"You are enigmatic, but sufficiently expressive, Mr. Ashleigh. I think I comprehend you, at least. But if he is that kind of person, why is he admitted here?\" \"Dear Miss Grenville, it\u0027s exactly because he is that kind of person that they\u0027re glad to see him here. He\u0027s somebody in his line, don\u0027t you know; though it\u0027s a bad line. His name, which I forget, is always mentioned in Bell and the sporting-papers, and that kind of thing; and he\u0027s a--what do you call it--notoriety on the turf. By Jove! Coote is just going to make those fellows leave off. Do let\u0027s finish the valse.\" The couple whirled away to the last bars of the music; and Miles, who had perforce overheard this conversation, glanced across the room at the subject of it, who was still standing with his face averted, talking to Lady Carabas. \"A pleasant man that, if all my dancing friend said of him is true,\" said Miles to himself. \"I wonder what Lord Sandilands would think of him? Pshaw! he\u0027d take it like a man of the world; and--eh? there is the old gentleman, making his way over here; where can he have been all the evening?\" Whatever doubts Miles Challoner may have felt as to the line of conduct which Lord Sandilands would adopt towards the gentleman on whom Miles had bestowed so much observation, they were destined to be speedily set at rest. As Lord Sandilands passed the group at the other end of the room, Lady Carabas beckoned to him; and by the way in which he and the unknown bowed to each other, Miles easily divined that the ceremony of introduction had taken place. With a half-smile at the incongruity just perpetrated, Miles was making his way across the room, when a servant came up to him and said: \"I beg your pardon, sir, are you Mr. Lloyd?\" Miles had scarcely time to reply in the negative, when the groom of the chambers, a very solemn-looking personage, who was passing at the moment, and who heard the inquiry, said, \"That is Mr. Lloyd talking to her ladyship, James. What is wanted?\" \"Only Lord Ticehurst, sir, told me to tell Mr. Lloyd he couldn\u0027t wait any longer;\" and the man proceeded on his mission. Meanwhile Lady Carabas\u0027 quick eye had spied Miles approaching, and she advanced to meet him. \"Mr. Challoner,\" said she, with a gracious smile, \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ve had a horribly dull evening; been dreadfully bored, and all that kind of thing. O, don\u0027t deny it; I\u0027m sure of it. But the fact is I thought Lord Sandilands would tell you who people were, and introduce you, and all that; and now I find he has been poked away in the library all night, looking at some horrid old political caricatures. Ridiculous of him, I tell him, to strain his eyes over such nonsense. He looks quite pale and worn. You must come and help me to scold him. By the way, I must introduce you to a very charming friend of mine, who fortunately is still here.--Mr. Lloyd,\" touching him--with her fan, \"let me introduce Mr. Challoner.\" The young man addressed wheeled round when he felt the touch on his arm, and before the last words were uttered he confronted Miles Challoner as Lady Carabas pronounced the name; and at that instant the light died out of his small and sunken blue eyes, his cheeks became colourless, and his thin lips closed tightly under his long fair moustache. Simultaneously a bright scarlet flush overspread Miles Challoner\u0027s face. Both then bowed slightly, but neither spoke; and immediately afterwards Miles turned sharply on his heel, and wishing Lady Carabas a formal \"good-night,\" hurried from the room. \"My dear boy,\" said Lord Sandilands--they were in the brougham going home--\"you must pardon my saying that your treatment of Mr.--Mr. Lloyd was brusque to a degree. Supposing him even to be a highly objectionable person, the fact that you were introduced to him by Lady Carabas should have assured him a--well, a more gracious reception, to say the least of it. You--why, what the deuce is the matter, Miles? you\u0027re dead-white, and your hand shakes?\" \"Nothing, dear old friend. I shall be all right again directly. That man--was I rude to him? I scarcely knew what I said or did. That man is one whom it was my father\u0027s most urgent wish I should never meet or know.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3311/90505.html","bookId":405,"book":{"id":405,"title":"The Rock Ahead.","description":"简介： Hot in Brighton, very hot.
