{"id":25521,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER V. An Explosion.","content":"When Gilbert Lloyd awoke the next morning after an excellent night\u0027s rest, his first impression was that something disagreeable had happened on the previous evening, but it was some time before he could exactly recollect all the circumstances and pass them calml4y in review before him. Even when he had done so he felt by no means certain how far matters had gone. He had taken too much of that infernal brandy, he remembered with disgust--taken it because he had been brooding over that business at Brighton which happened years ago, it is true, but which some confounded fate seemed to have set people talking about lately. He had not thought about it, it had never troubled him, and now he found his mind continually running on that one subject. It must have been the constant reference made by those about him to--to his wife that must have turned his thoughts in that direction. Curses on that Sunday regulation of shutting the telegraph-offices! If he had only been able to send that telegram as he had originally intended early in the morning, it would have stopped her coming down, and prevented her having that fatal hold over him, of which she is well aware, and which she is determined to exercise if necessary. It was thinking last night of all these things combined that had sent him to the brandy-bottle, a dangerous habit, which seemed to be growing upon him, he thought, and which he must at once break himself of, as ruinous and destructive of all chances of keeping that clearness of brain which was to him a vital necessity. He was muddled the previous night; he felt it then; he only saw through a glass darkly what had happened, and the retrospect was by no means agreeable. Etchingham had annoyed him, he recollected that; and he had replied without measuring his language, and the result had been that they had agreed to part. O yes, now he remembered what Bobby Maitland had told Etchingham about him. What an idiot he had been to make a row about such a thing as that! He knew well enough that Bobby Maitland had been trying all he knew for years to supplant him in Etchingham\u0027s confidence, that he was awfully jealous of him, and would say or do anything to get a rise out of him. He must have taken an amount of brandy to have made such an ass of himself. It was a comfort to know that Etchingham was sure to be all right in the morning, and to be in a great fright at what had occurred. He knew his pupil well enough to be certain of that. No doubt his lordship had also dined, and had taken quite enough of Mr. Stackborough\u0027s wine. They were both of them excited, no doubt, but he must take care and stand on his dignity, and then Etchingham would come round at once. So, thinking over these things, Gilbert Lloyd took his cold sea-water bath, which got rid of most of the ill effects of the previous night, and having leisurely dressed himself, descended to the room where breakfast was laid. He was the first; Lord Ticehurst had not yet appeared. So Gilbert took up the newspaper, and after glancing at the state of the odds and the sporting-intelligence generally, remained expectant. He had not to wait very long. In a few minutes Lord Ticehurst, looking very white and seedy, and with his small eyes more tightly screwed up and sunk more deeply into his head than usual, entered the room. Gilbert bade him \"good-morning,\" which his lordship, walking round the table and flinging himself into an easy-chair, only answered by a short nod. He then rang the bell, and, on the waiter\u0027s appearing, ordered brandy and soda-water. This, Lloyd argued to himself, was merely the effect of the \"morning after,\" the result of too much indulgence in Stackborough\u0027s wines. His lordship\u0027s digestion was impaired and consequently his temper suffered: both would improve simultaneously. But after his brandy and soda-water, Lord Ticehurst pulled his chair to the table, and commenced and proceeded with a very excellent breakfast, during the discussion of which he said never a word to his anxiously-expectant confederate, while, at its finish, he lit a big cigar, and, still mute, armed himself with a telescope, flung open the window, and stepped into the balcony to inspect the exhibition of the naiads bathing in the foreground. For once in his life Gilbert Lloyd was nonplused. He had made perfectly certain that Etchingham would have cried peccavi, would have come to him begging to have their relations replaced on the old footing; and here was the recalcitrant apparently quite at ease, not taking the least notice of him, and obviously rather enjoying himself than otherwise. Had he been blind, or had Etchingham\u0027s character suddenly changed? One thing was quite certain, that all was going wrong, and that he must take prompt measures to set himself right. Gilbert Lloyd was not an adept at leek-swallowing. He had played his cards so well during the latter portion at least of his life that he had seldom been required to perform that humiliating feat, but he saw that he must do it now. Lord Ticehurst was, like most good-natured men, intensely obstinate and sulky when affronted, and though Lloyd had had no experience of this state of his pupil\u0027s mood so far as he was regarded, he had seen it evidenced against others. It was perfectly plain that one of these fits, and a very strong one, was on Lord Ticehurst at present, and Lloyd was compelled to acknowledge to himself that if he wanted to retain his position in the future he must knuckle under unreservedly and at once. He laid down the newspaper which he had made a pretence of reading, and looked towards the window. There, in the balcony, sat his lordship, the light-blue smoke from his cigar curling round his head, and his eye fixed at the telescope which he held in his hand Gilbert rose and went behind him, but Lord Ticehurst, although he must have heard the footstep, never moved. Then Gilbert laid his hand on his pupil\u0027s shoulder, and said, \"Etchingham!\" His lordship moved his eye from the telescope, and looked quietly at Lloyd. \"Well?\" said he, in a sufficiently sulky manner. \"I have come to ask your pardon. I--\" \"O, there, that\u0027s all right,\" said his lordship, preparing to recommence his performance with the telescope. \"No, it is not all right. You and I have been intimate allies for a very long time. Until last night there has never been a word of difference between us. Nor would there have been then but for the infernal meddling of people who--\" \"O, just look here! I didn\u0027t name any names, remember. It was you who said you knew Bobby Maitland had been making mischief.\" \"It was I; I acknowledge it. You are quite right. You are far too good a fellow to say a word against even such a bad lot as that. I lost my temper, and I spoke out. But why? Because I was in a tremendous rage at the impudence of that fellow Maitland daring to put his own words and his own sentiments into my mouth, and to pretend that I had said them. His own words and sentiments, I say, and no one else\u0027s.\" \"What! Do you mean to say that you never said--all that confounded stuff about the \u0027nurse,\u0027 and all that?\" \"I pledge you my word of honour I never said anything of the kind.\" Lord Ticehurst looked straight at him as he said these words, but Gilbert Lloyd met the look firmly, without the smallest increase of colour, without the movement of a muscle in his face. \"Well,\" said his lordship, after a momentary pause, \"of course after that I cannot say any more. I was most infernally riled when I heard you\u0027d been chaffing about me, I\u0027ll allow; because, after all, don\u0027t you know, when you and a fellow have lived together, and been regular pals, and that kind of thing--\" \"And you thought I could have been such a scoundrel as to do that? No, Etchingham, I don\u0027t pretend to be strait-laced, and I don\u0027t go in to be demonstrative and gushing in my affection for you, like those duffers who are always hanging about you in town, and whose game you see through perfectly, I know. My regard for you I endeavour to show in another way, in devoting myself heart and soul to the management of your affairs; and if you look into them I think you\u0027ll find that I am faithful and true to you.\" Into his voice, as he uttered these last words, Gilbert Lloyd threw a little tremulous touch of sentiment, which gave evidence of a hitherto undeveloped histrionic ability, and which was really excellent of its kind. It was so close an imitation of the genuine article that most people would have been taken in by it, and Lloyd looked to see a responsive twinkle in his pupil\u0027s eyes; but clever and telling as it was it failed to touch Lord Ticehurst. He said, \"All right, Gilbert, old fellow; of course I know that. Here, there\u0027s an end of it!\" and he stretched out his hand; but there was no heartiness, no enthusiasm in his tone, no warmth in the grasp he gave, and Gilbert Lloyd recognised all this, and began to feel a dim prescience that his hold on his lordship was beginning to wax faint, and that his position as chief manager of Lord Ticehurst\u0027s affairs was manifestly insecure. Was Gilbert Lloyd\u0027s luck really beginning to fail him? Had the devil, who had stood his friend so long, and aided him in his advancement so wonderfully, grown tired of and forsaken him? It seemed like it, he was forced to confess to himself. By nature cool, crafty, and clear-headed, and from long practice in matters in which the exercise of those qualities is constantly required, Lloyd was by no means a man to suffer himself to remain blind to any danger which might threaten him. There are men amongst us passing for sane, nay, even reputed to be clever, who obstinately shut their eyes against the sight of the chasm towards which they are pressing forward, who are obstinately deaf to the roar of the avalanche which in a few seconds must overwhelm them, when by merely striking out into a new path--not so pleasant indeed, and that is mostly what they look at--they might avoid their fate. These are the men who, Micawber-like, are always expecting something to turn up, who refuse to see the plainest portents, to listen to the most obvious warnings, who think that bills disregarded are payments indefinitely deferred, and who put away unpleasant-looking letters unopened with the idea that the bad news they bring will thereby be staved off, who go on quo Fata ducunt, and who are astonished when they find themselves involved in misery and ruin. Gilbert Lloyd was very different from this. Let a cloud, even though it were \"no bigger than a man\u0027s hand,\" appear above the horizon, and he took note of it instantly. He was specially observant of the slightest change in the character or demeanour of those with whom he was brought in contact, even of persons of inferior grade. In fact, although for a long time past his life had been one of comparative ease and undoubted luxury, he had never forgotten the habits acquired in the early days of poverty and shifting and scheming, when his hand was against every man and every man\u0027s hand against him, and he was prepared to go to the end of the world, or out of it altogether for the matter of that, if he saw plainly the necessity of absconding, or felt that his Fate had arrived. Was his luck going? Was his game nearly played out? There had been a great change lately, without a doubt; he must not shut his eyes to that. Etchingham was certainly changed. Very civil and acquiescent in all that was suggested to him, never referring to their dispute on that unlucky night, but still without a particle of the heartiness which formerly characterised him, and which was the salt of his otherwise unpleasant disposition. There had been a turn of luck, too, in turf-matters. Some of his own private speculations (for Gilbert had a book of his own in addition to the \"operations\" in which he had a joint interest with Lord Ticehurst, and was said also to do a great deal by anonymous commission) had been very unfortunate during the past season, and so far as he could see he was not likely to recoup himself by any success at Doncaster, where one of Lord Ticehurst\u0027s cracks had been disgracefully beaten for the Cup, while another, which had been one of the leading favourites for the Leger, had run down the scale in the most alarming manner, and was now, on the eve of the race, scarcely mentioned in the betting. Was his luck going? was his game nearly played out? Venit summa dies et ineluctabile fatum!Where had he heard that, Gilbert Lloyd wondered as he sat on the edge of his bed at the Angel Inn at Doncaster, turning all these things in his mind. Ineluctabile fatum.. He gave a half-shudder as he repeated the words, and he gulped down half the tumbler of brandy standing on the table by his side. He felt a frissonrun through him--that kind of creeping feeling which silly old women ascribe to the fact of someone \"walking over your grave\"--on which the brandy had no effect, and he stamped his foot in rage at his weakness. He was all wrong somehow; out of health, perhaps? But his clear sense refused to be deluded by that excuse. Ineluctabile fatum!that was it, the summa diesfor him was at hand; he felt it, he knew it, and found it in vain to struggle, impossible to make head against it. The roar of the crowd in the street came through the open window of the room in which he sat, that hideous roar which fills the streets of every country town at race-time, and which he knew so well, with its component parts of ribaldry, blasphemy, bestiality, and idiotcy. The day was bright and hot and clear--what did the noise outside and the bright day remind him of? Something unpleasant, he felt, but he could not exactly fix it in his memory. He rose, and his eyes fell on the big, heavy, old-fashioned four-post bedstead on which he had been seated, and on the table with the glass and bottles standing by it. And then in an instant what had been dimly haunting his memory flashed all bright across his brain: Brighton, the crowd of racing-men on the cliff in the hot, bright weather, and the lodging, with Harvey Gore dying on the bed! Gilbert Lloyd swallowed the remainder of the brandy, and hurried downstairs into the street. Immediately opposite the inn-door, and surrounded by a little crowd, a preacher--as is often to be seen on such occasions--was holding forth. The crowd mocked and jeered, but the preacher, secure in the stentorian powers of his lungs, never stopped in his attacks on the wickedness going on around him; and the first words which Lloyd heard as he issued from the inn were, \"Prepare to meet thy God!\" The gentlemen who had \"operated\" against Lord Ticehurst\u0027s horse in the betting-ring were, on the succeeding day, proved to be perfectly correct in their prognostications; that eminent animal being as far behind the winner of the Leger as his stable-companion had been in the race for the Cup. This result did not affect Lord Ticehurst much, so far as his betting losses were concerned; he had so much money that it mattered little to him whether he won or lost; but he did not like losing the prestigewhich had attached to his stable ever since Lloyd had succeeded poor old Dobbs and taken the stud in hand And he particularly disliked the half-pitying, half-chaffing way in which several men condoled with him about it. \"What\u0027s come to you, dear old Etchingham?\" said Bobby Maitland, who had been unable to withstand the fascinations of the Doncaster Meeting, and had accordingly persuaded Mr. Stackborough to leave the yacht at anchor off Dover while they came north; \"what\u0027s come to you, old man? The white jacket and cherry spots seem now always to be where the little boat was--all behind!\" \"We have not been very lucky lately, have we?\" replied his lordship, with an attempt at a grin--he writhed under Bobby\u0027s compassionate familiarity; \"but we did very well early in the year; and you can\u0027t have it always, don\u0027t you know.\" \"Ah yes, to be sure, you had some little things, I recollect,\" said Bobby Maitland more furtively than ever. \"Don\u0027t know what you call \u0027little things,\u0027 Maitland,\" said Lord Ticehurst, twitted out of his usual reticence; \"the One Thousand, and the Ascot Cup, with two of the best things at Stockbridge. That seems pretty good to me; but I suppose it\u0027s nothing to you. You never even won a donkey-race that I heard of.\" \"O yes, he did,\" said Gilbert Lloyd, who had come up to them unseen, and overheard the last remark; \"O yes; Bobby won a donkey-race once, and he was so proud of it, he always takes the animal about with him. He\u0027s somewhere in the neighbourhood now, I\u0027ll swear!\" There was a shout of laughter at this remark from all the men standing round, which was increased to a roar as Mr. Stackborough, dressed most elaborately, was seen approaching the group. It was always said that Bobby Maitland had never been seen to lose his temper. At that instant he was within an ace of it; but he controlled himself with an effort, and said, \"That\u0027s not bad, Lloyd; not at all bad, for you. When you order Lloyd\u0027s man\u0027s new livery, Etchingham, you must have a cap and bells added to it. \u0027Gad, you\u0027re like one of those great swells in the olden time, who used to keep a fool to amuse their friends!\" \"Haw, haw! Maitland had him there!\" shouted \"Barrel\" Moss, a fat, handsome Israelite, ex-gambling-house-keeper, now racehorse-proprietor and betting-man, admitted into the society of the highest patrons of the turf. \"What are you grinning at, Barrel?\" retorted Gilbert. \"You may thank your stars you did not live in the days of those \u0027great swells of the olden time.\u0027 Why, when Jews wouldn\u0027t pay, they used to pull their teeth out; and what would have become of you when you were posted in Teddington\u0027s year? Why you wouldn\u0027t have had a single grinder left!\" Once more the laugh was on Lloyd\u0027s side, and taking advantage of his triumph he pushed through the knot gathered round him, and, taking Lord Ticehurst by the arm, moved off towards the hotel. The colloquy between the two, as they walked along, was brief. His lordship was more than a little \"out of sorts.\" His rejection by Miss Lambert yet rankled in his mind; his recent want of success on the turf upset and annoyed him. He was fidgety and fretful, and when Gilbert asked him what they should do, and where they should go to next, he confessed as much, and said that he did not care so long as he was \"out of the whole d--d thing!\" Such a state of mind rather coinciding with Gilbert Lloyd\u0027s own feelings at the time, that astute counsellor, instead of opposing his patron\u0027s unmistakable though oddly expressed views, fell in with them at once; declared that everything from British Dan to British Beersheba was barren, and suggested that they should go abroad for a month or two, lie fallow, and pick up health. Lord Ticehurst fully agreed with the idea of going abroad, but \"would not have any of your touring;\" he had had enough of Switzerland, thank you; and as for any of those dead-alive old cribs where fellows poked about among pictures and those kind of things, well, he would as soon cut his throat offhand! He did not mind going to Hombourg or Baden, or one of those places where there was something to be done, and plenty of people to be seen. It was Gilbert\u0027s policy just at that time to keep his pupil in good-humour if possible, so that even if the notion of a visit to Baden had not happened to be agreeable to him, he would doubtless have suppressed his own feelings and assented with a good grace. But situated as he was, wanting a thorough change, and yet so ill at ease as to fear being left alone to his own resources in a dull place, the gaiety of a foreign watering-place was exactly what he would have chosen. So, two days after, the Morning Postrecorded that \"the Earl of Ticehurst and Mr. Gilbert Lloyd passed through town yesterday en routefor Baden.\" Men of middle age, who recollect Baden before the fatal facility of travel, or the invention of Mr. Cook and his excursionists, must look back with deep regret upon the pleasant days when comparatively few English people found their way along the newly-opened railway that crept along the bank of the Oos. The place was known, of course; but the difference between the visitors then and nowadays was as great as between the visitors to the gardens of Hampton Court on any ordinary fine day in early spring or on Easter Monday. The style of the company, despite the importing of many of the great British aristocracy who in former years never visited the place, but now find it much cheaper and more amusing than \"entertaining\" for partridge-shooting at home, has gradually been decaying; but since the establishment of the races it has received a large proportion of that very worst ingredient, the sporting-cad. When Lord Ticehurst and Lloyd arrived, the races were just about to take place, and there was a strong muster of the \"professionals\" of high and middle grade, the worst being kept away by the difficulty of obtaining means of transport from England, which is a mercy of which the Germans are not sufficiently aware to be properly thankful for. The lowest order of sporting-man is the lowest order of anything. If anyone wishes to be impressed with the depth of degradation to which the human species can be successfully reduced, he has only to go into the Strand on a day when some great \"event\" is coming off, and observe the persons gathered round the office of the great sporting-newspaper about four in the afternoon. He will see a crowd of men of all ages--wizened old creatures, big burly roughs, shambling knock-kneed hobbledehoys, in battered hats, in greasy, close-fitting caps, most of them shirt-collarless, but with belcher handkerchiefs twisted round their thick throats; many of them have the long, flat thieves\u0027 curl on the side of the face; nearly all have the hair cut close round the nape of the neck: costermongers, butchers, the scum and refuse of the population; dirty, half-starved, in clothes whose looped and windowed raggedness would be dear at half-a-crown for the whole lot. These be the gallant sporting-men, without the slightest knowledge of or care for sport, who, in order to enable them to bet their half-crowns on a race, empty tradesmen\u0027s tills, burst into our houses, and \"put the hug\" on us in the open street. Of course this class was unrepresented in the great gathering at Baden; but there was a large influx of people who had never been seen there before. They filled the hotels and lodging-houses; they swaggered over the promenades; they lounged about the Kursaal, outraging the dignity of the officials by talking and laughing loudly; and they played at the tables, slapping their coins down with a ring, or motioning and calling to the grave croupiers \"just to hook \u0027em that louy they\u0027d left behind.\" They were a cause of great offence to Tommy Toshington, on whom Gilbert lighted on the morning after his arrival at the springs, where the old gentleman was holding a tumbler of very nasty water with a very shaky hand, and, in default of having anyone to talk to, was vainly endeavouring for the five-hundredth time to find out the meaning of some very tremendous frescoes in front of him. \"I\u0027ve been in the habit of comin\u0027 to this place for an immense number of years, and thought I could go on till I died. Devilish comfortable quarters I\u0027ve got at the Roossy, and nice amusin\u0027 place I\u0027ve always found it; but I must give it up, by George! I can\u0027t stand the set of racin\u0027-fellows that come here now, \u0027pon my soul I can\u0027t! God knows who they are, my good fellow. You, who go about to all these what-do-you-call-\u0027em meetings, you may know some of \u0027em; but I, who only toddle down to the Derby and Ascot on Sumphington\u0027s drag, and get over to Goodwood when the Dook\u0027s good enough to ask me--I\u0027ve never set eyes on any of \u0027em before.\" \"Well, but how do they annoy you, Toshington?\" asked Gilbert, who was rather amused at this outbreak on the old gentleman\u0027s part. \"They don\u0027t actually annoy me, except by bein\u0027 such a dam low-bred lot, yahooin\u0027 all over the place. And to think of \u0027em comin\u0027 just now, when we were so pleasant. It\u0027s rather late in the season, to be sure; but there\u0027s a very nice set of people here. My Lady Carabas is here, but that youknew, of course; and the Dook and Duchess of Winchester, and the Dashwoods, and the Grevilles, and the Alsagers, and Tom Gregory and half the First. It\u0027s monstrous pleasant, you can\u0027t think!\" \"It must be,\" said Gilbert quietly. \"So new and fresh and charming. Such a change, too, for you all, not to see anybody you are accustomed to meet in London,--it must be delightful. Goodbye, Toshington; I\u0027m going in for rusticity, and intend to have a turn before breakfast.\" Although Mr. Toshington\u0027s sense of humour was very slight, and although he took most things au pied de la letter, he detected some sarcasm in Gilbert\u0027s remarks, and looked after him from under scowling brows. \"That\u0027s another of \u0027em,\" he muttered; \"another of your horse-racin\u0027 customers, though he is in society, and all that. Damme if I know how they let \u0027em in; I don\u0027t, by George! They\u0027d as soon have thought of lettin\u0027 a fiddler, or a painter, or a fellow of that sort into society when I was a young man. But it\u0027s best to keep in with this one; he has the orderin\u0027 of everything at Etchingham\u0027s, and might leave me out of many a good thing if he chose to be disagreeable.\" So saying, the old worldling finished his second glass of Brunnenwasser, paid his kreutzers, audibly cursed the coinage of the country in a select mixture of the English and German languages prepared expressly by him for his own use, and departed. Mr. Toshington was perfectly right in stating that the Marchioness of Carabas was enthroned in great state at Baden, but wrong in imagining that Gilbert Lloyd was aware of that fact. Truth to tell, there had been a slight misunderstanding, what is vulgarly but intelligibly called a \"tiff,\" between her ladyship and Lloyd, and for a few weeks past he had not been enlightened as to her movements. The fact was, that when Lloyd had sufficiently used the grand dameas a means to various business ends, as a stepping-stone to certain objects which without her aid he would have been unable to reach, he began to find his position rather a wearying one. It was pleasant to be the custodian and hierophant of the Soul while it served his purpose, but it was dreary work when that purpose was achieved, and his interest in the Soul\u0027s owner was consequently gone. He attended at the shrine as regularly as ever for reasons of policy, but his policy was not sufficiently strong to keep him from occasionally gaping and betraying other signs of weariness. Lady Carabas was too observant a woman not to mark this immediately on its first occurrence, but she thought it might be accidental, and determined to wait a repetition of it before speaking. The repetition very shortly afterwards took place, and even then her ladyship did not speak. After a little reflection she determined on adopting another plan. She resolved upon taking to herself someone else who should be admitted into the mysteries of the Soul. This, she thought, would capitally answer a double purpose; it would tend to her amusement--and she was beginning to feel the want of a little novelty, she confessed to herself--and would probably have the effect of rendering Gilbert Lloyd jealous. A little time showed the result. In the turf-idiom which she had learned of Lloyd, and which she sometimes used in self-communion, she acknowledged that \"while the first event had come off all right, the second had gone to grief;\" which, being interpreted, meant that while she (Lady Carabas) was thoroughly amused, and indeed at the height of one of her Platonic flirtations with the new possessor of the Soul (a young man in the Foreign Office, with lovely hair parted in the middle, charming whiskers, and brilliant teeth), he (Gilbert Lloyd) had not shown the smallest symptom of jealousy. On the contrary, Gilbert Lloyd was unfeignedly glad to find that his place had been satisfactorily filled up, and that he would no longer be constantly required to be on escort-duty. And when Lady Carabas found that this was the case--and she discovered it very quickly, being a woman of great worldly penetration and tact--she made up her mind that the best thing for her to do was to accept the position at once, and give Lloyd his liberty. This accordingly she did; and when they met at Baden, \"They seemed to those who saw them meet, Mere casual friends of every day;\" as Lord Houghton says in a very charming little poem, though there was an echo of bygone tenderness, of the voice of the Soul, in fact, pervading her ladyship\u0027s tones for many a day after. Meantime she was the queen of a very pleasant little coterie. Half the frequenters of Carabas House did a little passing homage at her ladyship\u0027s temporary court at Baden on their way to and from the other watering-places. The promenade contained types of all the people usually seen seated on the Hyde-Park chairs, with a large sprinkling of others never seen in that aristocratic locality. For though H.R.H. the Duke of Brentford, the captains and commanders and mighty men of valour, the senators, the clerks in the government offices, and the nothing-doers have plenty of time to lounge about in London, the working-bees--the judges and barristers, the doctors, the civil-engineers, the cunning workers in ink and pigment, all of whom grind their brains to make their bread--have no such opportunity when in town, and are only seen idling in daylight during their brief autumn holiday. \"Society\"--except that Carabas-House set, which knew them very well--stared very much at most of these people, and called Jack Hawkes of the F. O. to its aid to explain who they were; and Jack Hawkes, who was only too delighted to act as cicerone to society when it had a handle to its name, explained, \"Tall man with the round high shoulders and the long gray hair is great lady\u0027s doctor, don\u0027t you know? uses up three pair of horses a-day whippin\u0027 about town; that\u0027s his wife and daughter with him--think her pretty, the daughter? nice-lookin\u0027 they call her. The man with the red face, not him in the white hat--that\u0027s Kollum the portrait-painter; that one in the wideawake is Sir Blewson Bagge, one of the judges--say he knows more law than any other three men in England The fat man with the cigar is Protheroe, and the man talkin\u0027 to him dressed all in black is Tuberville; they\u0027re great engineers--one laid out the John o\u0027 Groat\u0027s and Land\u0027s End Extension Line, and the other designed the Channel-Islands Submarine Railway. Wonderful how they stick together, those railway fellows; if one knows a good thing he tells the other of it, and they hunt in couples to keep other fellows off the game. Tuberville\u0027s son has married Protheroe\u0027s daughter; and the money that\u0027s there passes all count. There are two writin\u0027 chaps comin\u0027 this way; they belong to the Kresse, that blackguard paper that attacks everybody, don\u0027t you know? Don\u0027t look bad fellows, do they? and they\u0027re always laughin\u0027 and keepin\u0027 it up at the Badischer. Who\u0027s the little round fat fellow they\u0027ve stopped and are talkin\u0027 to?--that\u0027s Bellows of the Old-Bailey Bar; first-rate in his business, and such good company; and the man with him of course you know? No! Why that\u0027s Finchington, the light comedian of the Minerva. Yes, he does look different in the daylight, as you say. These? No, these are people who have come over for the races, and I don\u0027t know anything about them. We must get Lloyd to give us that information.--Here, Lloyd, come and tell her grace who are these odd people who are coming this way; they\u0027re turf-people, I suppose, so you\u0027ll know all about them.\" But Gilbert Lloyd, objecting very much to be patronised either by Mr. Hawkes or the great people to whom that social barnacle had temporarily attached himself, declared his inability to perform the duties assigned to him, and took himself off with a bow. It was the night before the first race-day, and all the Baden world was enjoying itself on the promenade in front of the Kursaal. There had been a grand excursion-party that day to the Favourite, a party of which Lady Carabas had been the reigning star, and after a delightful outing they had returned, and were now formed into a large group, laughing and talking loudly. Gilbert Lloyd carefully avoided these people, and steered equally clear of another group in the midst of which the Duchess of Winchester was enthroned. These two great ladies had never much liked each other, and when they met at Baden their antagonism was patent, and their rivalry openly declared. Each had her circle of admirers, and whatever one did the other tried to outdo. The Winchester faction having heard that the Carabas people were going that day to the Favourite, had themselves had a picnic at Eberstein Schloss, and both were now planning their next day\u0027s diversion at the races. Gilbert Lloyd was in no humour to join either of these parties at that moment, though each would have been glad to have secured him as an adherent. He was in a bad temper, having just had some sharp words with Lord Ticehurst on a question on which that young nobleman a few weeks since would not have dared to offer an opinion. Just before they left town for Doncaster, Lloyd had dismissed a groom; the man appealed to Lord Ticehurst in a letter. This letter Lloyd opened, read, and contemptuously threw into the fire. The man heard of this, and made a fresh appeal to his lordship, setting forth the treatment his former letter had received, and defying Lloyd to deny it. This letter was forwarded to Lord Ticehurst at Baden, and made him exceedingly angry. He went at once to Lloyd, and spoke very plainly, said that he would not be treated like a child, that all letters addressed to him--no matter on what subject--should be brought to him, and even hinted that on their return to England Lloyd\u0027s position and responsibility must be more exactly defined. \"It was that infernal Maitland\u0027s hint that he can\u0027t swallow,\" said Lloyd, as he seated himself at an empty table on the verge of the crowd and ordered some brandy. \"He referred to it just now when he said he wouldn\u0027t be treated like a child. O he\u0027s never spoken to me like that since we\u0027ve been together.--Here!\" to the waiter who brought the brandy, \"encore; another of these carafons.. What\u0027s the good of a drop like that to a man!--He\u0027s never been the same since that night he dined with those fellows, after he had been over to that place to-- Lord! I forgot--to propose to her!Of course shemust be mixed up in everything that\u0027s unlucky for me! How I wish I\u0027d never set eyes on her! how I wish--What the devil does this fellow want!\" \"This fellow\" was a short, square-built man of about fifty years of age, with sunken eyes, a sharp-pointed nose, and a close-cut beard, the original red colour of which was fast fading into gray. His seedy clothes were of a foreign and fantastic cut, and round his neck he wore a long, dirty-white cravat, folded quite flat, and wonderfully neatly tied, and fastened in front with a flashy mock pin. \"This fellow\" had been hanging round the table for some time, dodging in and out so as to get a better view of its occupant in the dim light. At length, when Gilbert Lloyd raised his head and looked up at the strange figure, \"this fellow\" seemed to be satisfied, and shambling up to the table, placed his hands upon it, leaned over, and said in a thick, husky voice, \"Gilbert Lloyd!\" Lloyd looked at him steadily, and then said, \"That\u0027s my name; who are you?\" \"I thought you would not know me,\" said the stranger with a laugh, \"none of my old pals do; at least, most don\u0027t, and some won\u0027t, so it don\u0027t make much--\" \"Stay,\" interrupted Lloyd; \"I know you now; knew you directly you threw your head back and I saw your cravat. There\u0027s only one man in the world can tie a neckerchief like that, or get its folds to lie as flat. You\u0027re Foxey Walker.\" \"I am that same,\" said the stranger; \"at least, I was when I was alive, for I\u0027m nothing but a blessed old ghost now, I verily believe.--Here, you fellow, bring some brandy; Cognac, you know!--I ain\u0027t of much \u0027count now, Lloyd, and that\u0027s a fact.\" He was shabby and bloated and shaky, altogether very different from the tight, trim little Foxey, who was found leaning over the rails on Brighton Esplanade at the commencement of this story. \"Ah, I remember,\" said Lloyd; \"you came to grief the Derby before last, in the Prior\u0027s year?\" \"I did so. Went a regular mucker. That was a bad business, sir; a regular bad business. I could show you my book now. There were men that I dropped my money to over that Epsom Meetin\u0027 that had owed me hundreds--ay, hundreds on other events. I\u0027d always given them time, much as they wanted, I had; but when I asked \u0027em for it then--for I had a rattlin\u0027 good book for Ascot, and some good things later on in the season--O no, not a bit of it! \u0027Pay up,\u0027 they says, \u0027pay up!\u0027 All devilish fine; I couldn\u0027t pay up--so I bolted.\" \"Ah, recollect perfectly your being proclaimed a defaulter,\" said Lloyd pleasantly. \"It made rather a talk at the time, you were so well known. What have you been doing since?\" \"Well, I\u0027ve been cadgin\u0027 about on the Continent, doin\u0027 what I could to keep body and soul together.--You\u0027re goin\u0027 to pay for this brandy, you know? I suppose you don\u0027t mind standin\u0027 another go? all right.--But there\u0027s little enough to be done. I ain\u0027t much good at cards; and, besides, there\u0027s nothing to be done with them unless you get among the swells in the clubs and that, and that\u0027s not likely; and there\u0027s not much to be picked up off the foreigners at billiards, let alone their not playing our game. I\u0027ve won a little on the red and black here and there, and I\u0027ve come across an old friend now and again who\u0027s helped me with a fiver or so.\" \"You don\u0027t speak in riddles, Foxey,\" said Lloyd with a half-laugh. \"You make your meaning tolerably clear. I must not be worse than the others, I suppose; so here, catch hold;\" and he took a couple of bank-notes from his pocket-book and handed them to his companion. \"Thank\u0027ee, Lloyd,\" said Foxey, pocketing the money. \"I ain\u0027t proud, and hadn\u0027t need to be. Besides, you\u0027ve become a tremendous swell since you got hold of young Ticehurst, eh? I see your name regular in Bell amongst the nobs. Rather different from what we reck\u0027lect in the old days: \u0027Ten to one, bar one!\u0027--don\u0027t you remember?\" and Foxey put his hand to the side of his mouth and shouted loudly in imitation of the worthies of the outer ring. \"Ye-es,\" said Lloyd, who did not at all relish being told that he had \"got hold of\" anybody, and who was much disgusted by Foxey\u0027s recollections and performance. \"Yes,\" said he, rising from his chair as he spoke; \"I think I must go now.\" \"Must you?\" said Foxey, who had become very much flushed and invigorated by the brandy; \"must you? That\u0027s a bore, that is, for I had somethin\u0027 very particular to say to you; somethin\u0027 that concerns you much more than it does me; somethin\u0027,\" added Foxey, looking hazily at his companion, \"that would be d--d awkward for you if it got blown. Don\u0027t you fear for me! I\u0027m as close as wax, I am; only--however, I\u0027ll see you about it to-morrow or next day. Good-night, old fellow; compliments to my lord.\" \"Something that concerns me more than it does him? That would be awkward for me if it got blown? What the devil does he mean?\" said Lloyd to himself, as he walked down the allée.. \"Awkward for me?--the old brute was drunk, and did not know what he said. Probably a plant to get more money out of me. He couldknow nothing that would have the slightest bearing on me or my affairs. I daresay he\u0027ll try it on again when I see him next; but he\u0027ll find it difficult to draw me of any more money, more especially if he attempts to bounce me out of it.\" The next day was bright and cheerful, and the little racecourse, though much sneered at by the \"talent,\" served its purpose very well, and was thronged with a merry, animated crowd. The natives, to be sure, did not understand very much what it was all about. The women cried, \"Ach, Herr Je!\" at the sight of the tight little English jocks stripping off their outer coats and appearing in all the glory of flashing silk; and the men took their pipes from their mouths and swore \"Donnerwetter!\" as the horses went thundering by. The Winchester and Carabas faction had each one side of the little stand, the leaders exchanged sweet hand-kissings, the followers bowed and grinned and nodded with all the warmth and sincerity which form the basis of our social relations. Lady Carabas, as usual, wore pink; the Duchess of Winchester, who was very fair and petite, wore blue; and the retainers followed suit. Mr. Toshington was as much divided in his allegiance and as much perplexed to know which colour to sport as a London cabman on the morning of the University boat-race. He had enjoyed the hospitality of both houses, and indeed had earned many a good dinner by carrying tattle from one to the other; but up to this time he had never been called upon to make his election, to say \"under which queen;\" and those who were in the secret, in which category was included everyone present, were greatly amused to see the difficulty which the old gentleman had in trimming his sails and steering his course in safety. There were some who, unlike Tommy Toshington, were independent, who sided with neither party, but were friendly and familiar with both. Among those were Lord Ticehurst--who, though bound by family ties to Lady Carabas, never allowed his clanship to \"mix him up in any of her ladyship\u0027s rum starts,\" as he phrased it--and Gilbert Lloyd, whose worn and haggard appearance was the cause of much solicitude and anxious inquiry from Lady Carabas. Lloyd appeared rather annoyed at the prononcémanner which her ladyship adopted towards him, and at which some of the most daring followers smiled, more especially when the reigning favourite, the gentleman in the Foreign Office, looked very much displeased. He seemed very much happier when at a later period in the day he found himself seated by the Duchess of Winchester, who rallied him with much piquancy on his defection. \"I am astonished at you, Mr. Lloyd, quite astonished,\" she said laughingly. \"Do you know we used to call you the Undying One!\" \"Well, you could not call Toshington that, could you, Duchess?\" said Gilbert; \"look how very purple his whiskers are in the sunlight.\" \"No, no, of course I don\u0027t mean that; how can you be so absurd? You know our dear friend opposite is like somebody in old time I read of once, who used to kill her admirers regularly at the end of a certain time. It\u0027s a notorious fact that--over there--no flirtation lasts longer than twelve months, and we call you the Undying One because you have held undisputed sway over that Soul for--O, it must be years! And now, after all this, you have the baseness to shut your ears to the voice of the charmer--we saw the spell tried on an hour ago--and to come over here!\" \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much harm done, Duchess, even if all were as you say, which I am very far from admitting. Calypso is the only instance on record of a woman who \u0027ne pouvait se consoler après le depart\u0027 of anyone she liked. I am certain that no lady of modern days would be so weak.\" \"Ah, I know what you mean; you mean Mr. Pennington. Well, he\u0027s very good-looking, certainly, in his own red-and-white way, but he\u0027s insufferably stupid; and a stupid man, however handsome he may be, always bores me to death. I-- Who is this dreadful man down here? Is it to you or to me he\u0027s making those horrible grimaces?\" Lloyd looked over in the direction in which the Duchess pointed, and to his horror saw Mr. Foxey Walker, who apparently had had a great deal too much to drink, whose fantastic clothes looked infinitely shabbier and seedier in the daylight than they had on the previous evening, and who was throwing up his arms, endeavouring to attract the attention of someone in the stand. Foxey no sooner saw that Gilbert Lloyd had recognised him than he approached the stand, and called out, \"Hi, Lloyd! hollo there, Lloyd! Just come and pass me up there, will you? I want to speak to you.\" \"It\u0027s to you he\u0027s calling, Mr. Lloyd!\" said the Duchess, arching her pretty eyebrows and making a little moueof astonishment. \"What a strange-looking creature! who in the world is he?\" \"He\u0027s a poor half-witted fellow, an old friend of mine, Duchess,\" said Lloyd with the utmost calmness. \"He is a man of family, and once had a large fortune; but he lost every sixpence on the turf, and that quite turned his brain. He\u0027s eccentric, as you see, but perfectly harmless; a few of us make him a little allowance, on which he lives, and he thinks this gives him a claim upon us, poor fellow! I--Yes, yes; I\u0027m coming!\" he called to Mr. Foxey, for that gentleman had recommenced bellowing, \"Hi, Lloyd!\" with redoubled vehemence; \"I\u0027m coming!--I think I had better go down and calm him, Duchess, if you will excuse me.\" And with a bow Gilbert Lloyd leisurely retreated from the stand. He smiled so pleasantly--he knew he was still under observation--at Mr. Foxey, who was waiting for him in front, that that worthy, who had been somewhat doubtful of the wisdom of the course he had pursued, felt perfectly reassured and said, \"Hallo, Gil., my boy! sorry to call you away from such stunnin\u0027 company; but I want a word with you.\" It was not until they had walked a few paces and were well out of sight of the people in the stand that Lloyd caught his companion tightly by the arm, and said, \"You infernal drunken old idiot, how dare you come and annoy me when you saw me with my friends?\" \"Come, I say, drop that,\" said Foxey, \"you\u0027re pullin\u0027 my arm off; don\u0027t you hear?\" \"You scoundrel, I\u0027ll have your head off if you don\u0027t take care! What fool\u0027s game is up now? What do you want with me? Have you anything really to say, or is it only to repeat the rubbish of last night?\" \"What rubbish? what did I say last night? I didn\u0027t--no, of course I didn\u0027t; I recollect now. I know what I\u0027m doin\u0027 fast enough, and what I can do.\" \"And I know what I can do, and what I will do too, if you interrupt me again when I\u0027m talking with friends, and that is, have you moved off the course by the gend\u0027armes as a drunken nuisance.\" \"O, that\u0027s it, is it?\" said Foxey, glowering at him, and speaking in a dull thick voice. \"Moved off the course! a drunken nuisance, eh? You\u0027ll sing a very different toon to this, Master Lloyd, before I\u0027ve done with you. O, you can\u0027t come the high jeff over me,\" he continued, raising his tone; \"for all your standin\u0027 in with big swells now; we know what you were once; we know--\" \"Will you be quiet, you old fool, and say what you want?\" said Gilbert, turning fiercely upon him. \"What I want? Ah, that\u0027s more like it! What I want? Well, that\u0027s easily told, and that\u0027s more than most people can say. What I want is money.\" \"I gave you money last night--more than you can have spent, or ought to have spent.\" \"Ah, that\u0027s more like it: what I canspend--Well, no matter. However, that\u0027s not the way I mean in which I want money. Look here, Gilbert Lloyd; I\u0027m tired of this cadging life; I\u0027m sick of hikin\u0027 up and down from one gamblin\u0027-place to another; I\u0027m disgusted with the Continent, and the foreigners, all the lot of \u0027em.\" \"O, you are, eh?\" said Lloyd with a sneer; \"I should scarcely have thought it.\" \"Yes,\" replied Foxey, in perfect good faith, \"I am thoroughly. What I long for is to get back to England, to see my old pals, to lead my old life.\" \"Indeed,\" sneered Gilbert again; \"but from what I understand from you there would be some difficulty in carrying out that pleasant little arrangement.\" \"None that you couldn\u0027t help me to settle at once. They all think their money\u0027s clean gone; but if I\u0027m to come on the turf again, it would never do for me to come out as a welsher, so I must pay \u0027em something; but ever so little would square it. Then, if I just had a little trifle in hand to start with, and you gave me the office when you knew of a good thing--and you must hear lots, havin\u0027 the management of that young swell\u0027s stable--well, I should do as right as ninepence.\" There was a minute\u0027s pause, and then Lloyd said: \"You are a great creature, Mr. Walker, a very great creature, and your power of sketching out a happy future is something wonderful. But to my great astonishment I find that I play a part in this notable scheme of your life, and that its being carried out successfully wholly depends upon me. Now, we may as well understand each other clearly, and at once. From me you\u0027ll never get another sixpence.\" Foxey started, looked hard at his companion, and said, \"You mean that?\" \"No,\" said Lloyd, \"I don\u0027t mean it literally; I\u0027ll give you another ten pounds on the day I leave this place.\" It was Foxey\u0027s turn to sneer now. \"That\u0027s generous of you,\" he said, \"regular generous; but you always were a free-handed fellow with your money, Lloyd. I reck\u0027lect we used to say in the old days how pleased you always were to have to part. Now look here,\" he cried, changing his tone; \"I will have all I\u0027ve asked from you: the money to square it with those fellows, the sum to start fresh with the straight tips from young Ticehurst\u0027s stable; I\u0027ll have this, or else--\" \"Or what else?\" asked Gilbert Lloyd, without any alteration in his usual calm manner. \"Or else I\u0027ll ruin you, root and branch; horse and foot; stock, lock, and barrel! You laugh and sneer; you think I can\u0027t do it? I tell you I can.\" \"You tell me a pack of lies and blather. You begun last night, and you\u0027ve done nothing else for the last half-hour. How can you do it?\" \"By blowing the gaff on you; by telling something I know which would make all these swells cut you and hunt you out of society; which would--\" \"There, there\u0027s enough of this!\" cried Lloyd, interrupting him; \"my time\u0027s too valuable to waste over such trash. It\u0027s the old game of hush-money for a secret, after all. I should have thought you would have known some better dodge than that, Master Foxey, after all the life you\u0027ve seen. If you were going in for the extortion-of-money business in your old age, you might have learned something fresher than that very stale device. Now, be off, and give me a wider berth for the future, if you\u0027re wise. Your drunken stupidity--for I suppose you would not have acted thus if you had not taken to drink--has lost you ten pounds. Take care it does not get you a horsewhipping.\" As he said these words he turned shortly on his heel and strode away. Foxey looked after him, his face lit up with rage and disappointment. \"All right, my fine-fellow,\" he muttered, shaking his fist at the fast-receding figure; \"all right; you will have it, and you shall. It will be quite enough to cook your goose as it is; but if I\u0027d only had time to learn a little more, I think I could have hanged you.\" There was a little extra excitement in the rooms that night. Count Nicolaeff, a Russian nobleman who had on two previous occasions broken the bank, had returned to Baden, and was playing with a boldness and success which augured the repetition of the feat. A crowd was gathered round him as he sat, calm and composed, quietly gathering the rouleauxwhich the croupiers pushed across to him. In this crowd was Lloyd; the qualities which the Russian was displaying were just those to excite his admiration, and he was watching every movement and trying to account for each calculation of the gambler, when he felt a tap on his shoulder. He looked round and saw Dolly Clarke, the sporting-lawyer, who beckoned him away. Gilbert was annoyed at the interruption. \"Not just now,\" he said impatiently; \"I\u0027ll come to you later.\" \"Come this instant,\" said Dolly Clarke; and there was something in his tone that made Gilbert Lloyd leave the table and follow him into the open space outside. By the lamp-light Lloyd saw that Clarke was very pale; noticed also that he stood back as if avoiding contact with him. \"What is it?\" asked Lloyd. \"It should be something special by your tone and manner, Clarke?\" \"It is something special,\" replied Clarke; \"it is a matter of life or death for you. Do you know a man called Foxey Walker?\" \"Pshaw! is that all?\" said Lloyd, whose heart had failed him at the solemnity of his companion\u0027s manner, and whose courage now as suddenly revived. \"Is that all? Yes, I know him; a defaulting ring-man, a mere common \u0027welsher.\u0027 I saw him on the course to-day, and he threatened me that if I did not give him money he would expose something in my past life--some trick or dodge I practised, I suppose, when I was in the ring, and had to be a sharp practitioner to hold my own with my fellows. That\u0027s all, eh?\" \"No,\" said Clarke earnestly, \"nothing of the sort; the man has made a revelation, but not of the kind you imagine--a thousand times more serious. There\u0027s never been much love lost between you and me, Lloyd, and you may wonder why I\u0027m here to counsel and help you; so understand at once, it\u0027s for Ticehurst\u0027s sake; you\u0027re so mixed up with him that any public exposéwould be the deuce and all for him.\" \"What do you mean by public exposé, Mr. Clarke? what do you--\" \"Stop; don\u0027t bounce--it won\u0027t do. Do you remember when we dined at Richmond six weeks ago, you answered me very sharply because I asked why you never went to Brighton now? I\u0027ve always had my own opinion on that matter; but I don\u0027t chatter, and I kept it to myself. This man Walker stopped Ticehurst and me as we were coming from the course, and begged so earnestly for an interview that Ticehurst listened to him. I need not go into all he said; it appears he had his suspicions too, and determined to trade on them; went the next year to your old lodgings, pumped the landlady; saw the doctor who attended Harvey Gore; has been working it since he left England through friends; and has made up a case which, if not positive, is at all events infernally suspicious.\" \"What--what did Etchingham say about it?\" asked Lloyd. \"I never saw a fellow so completely knocked over in all my life. You know he is not strong-minded, and he--well, he funks death, and that kind of thing, and--\" \"Does he believe it? what does he say about me?\" \"He does believe it fully, and he says he will never set eyes on you again. I see--your eyes are blazing--you see there\u0027s nothing proved, and your place is too good a one to give up on mere suspicion? You\u0027ll say you\u0027ll have the matter sifted, and all that. Don\u0027t; take my advice--given as a lawyer who sees queer things in his practice--drop it, clear out of this at once, get over to England, make up Ticehurst\u0027s accounts, and then get away to Australia, America--anywhere!\" \"Thank you; and leave my \u0027place,\u0027 as you call it, to you, eh?\" It was the last remaining touch of bravado in his voice, bravado belied by the ashy paleness of his face, and the set rigidity of his mouth. \"To me! I\u0027m a lawyer, not a turfite. Pshaw! don\u0027t try to humbug any longer--you\u0027re too clever a man. You can post over to Carlsruhe to-night, and get straight through to-morrow. I\u0027ll come with you to the hotel; I promised Ticehurst I\u0027d see you off. Come.\" Gilbert Lloyd saw that there was no use in fighting the question any longer. He felt as though his career was at its close, as though he should drop as rapidly as he had risen. He turned on his heel and walked towards the hotel, Dolly Clarke walking by his side. It was all over, then? The position he had gained for himself amid the envy and hatred of all his compeers was shattered at its base, and-- No! Before he reached the hotel-door, he had carefully searched his hand, and found in it one last trump-card, which he determined on playing directly he arrived in England.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3311/90524.html","bookId":405,"book":{"id":405,"title":"The Rock Ahead.","description":"简介： Hot in Brighton, very hot.
