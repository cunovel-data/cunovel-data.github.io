{"id":8371,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. NICK HOLDEN\u0027S CALL.","content":"Philip had never liked Nick Holden. He was a coarse, rough-looking boy, his reddish face one mass of freckles, and about as unattractive as a person could be, without absolute deformity. This, however, was not the ground for Philip\u0027s dislike. With all his unattractiveness, Nick might have possessed qualities which would have rightly made him popular. So far from this, however, he was naturally mean, selfish, and a bully, with very slight regard for truth. Will it be believed that, in spite of his homely face, Nick really thought himself good-looking and aspired to be a beau? For this reason he had often wished that he possessed Philip\u0027s accomplishment of being able to play upon the violin. His conversational powers were rather limited, and he felt at a loss when he undertook to make himself fascinating to the young ladies in the village. If he could only play on the violin like Philip he thought he would be irresistible. He had therefore conceived the design of buying Philip\u0027s instrument for a trifle, judging that our hero would feel compelled to sell it. The reader will now understand the object which led to Nick\u0027s call so soon after the funeral of Mr. Gray. He was afraid some one else might forestall him in gaining possession of the coveted instrument. When Philip saw who his visitor was, he was not overjoyed. It was with reluctance that he rose and gave admission to Nick. “I thought I would call around and see you, Phil,” said Nick, as he sat down in the most comfortable chair in the room. “Thank you,” responded Phil coldly. “The old man went off mighty sudden,” continued Nicholas, with characteristic delicacy. “Do you mean my father?” inquired Philip. “Of course I do. There ain\u0027t any one else dead, is there!” “I had been expecting my poor father\u0027s death for some time,” said Philip gravely. “Just so! He wa\u0027n\u0027t very rugged. We\u0027ve all got to come to it sooner or later. I expect dad\u0027ll die of apoplexy some time-he\u0027s so awful fat,” remarked Nicholas cheerfully. “If he does, it\u0027s lucky he\u0027s got me to run the business. I\u0027m only eighteen, but I can get along as well as anybody. I\u0027m kinder smart in business.” “I am glad you are smart in anything,” thought Philip; for he knew that Nick was a hopeless dunce in school duties. “I hope your father\u0027ll live a good while,” he said politely. “Yes, of course,” said Nick lightly. “I\u0027d be sorry to have the old man pop off; but then you never can tell about such a thing as that.” Philip did not relish the light way in which Nick referred to such a loss as he was suffering from, and, by way of changing the subject, said: “I believe you said you came on business, Nicholas?” “Yes; that\u0027s what I wanted to come at. It\u0027s about your fiddle.” “My violin!” said Philip, rather surprised. “Oh, well, fiddle or violin! what\u0027s the odds? I want to buy it.” “What for?” “To play on, of course! What did you think I wanted it for?” “But you can\u0027t play, can you?” “Not yet; but I expect you could show me some—now, couldn\u0027t you?” “What put it into your head to want to play on the violin?” asked Philip, with some curiosity. “Why, you see, the girls like it. It would be kind of nice when I go to a party, or marm has company, to scrape off a tune or two-just like you do. It makes a feller kinder pop\u0027lar with the girls, don\u0027t you see?” said Nick, with a knowing grin. “And you want to be popular with the young ladies!” said Philip, smiling, in spite of his bereavement, at the idea being entertained by such a clumsy-looking caliban as Nick Holden. “Of course I do!” answered Nick, with another grin. “You see I\u0027m gettin\u0027 along-I\u0027ll be nineteen next month, and I might want to get married by the time I\u0027m twenty-one, especially if the old man should drop off sudden.” “I understand all that, Nicholas—” “Call me Nick. I ain\u0027t stuck up if I am most a man. Call me pet names, dearest.” And Nicholas laughed loudly at his witty quotation. “Just as you prefer. Nick, then, I understand your object. But what made you think I wanted to sell the violin?” It was Nick\u0027s turn to be surprised. “Ain\u0027t there goin\u0027 to be an auction of your father\u0027s things?” he said. “Yes; but the violin is mine, and I am not going to sell it.” “You\u0027ll have to,” said Nick. “What do you mean by that, Nicholas Holden?” said Philip quickly. “Because you\u0027ll have to sell everything to pay your father\u0027s debt. My father said so this very morning.” “I think I know my own business best,” said Philip coldly. “I shall keep the violin.” “Maybe it ain\u0027t for you to say,” returned Nick, apparently not aware of his insolence. “Come, now, I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. My father\u0027s got a bill against yours for a dollar and sixty-four cents. I told father I had a use for the fiddle, and he says if you\u0027ll give it to me, he\u0027ll call it square. There, what do you say to that?” Nicholas leaned back in his chair and looked at Philip through his small, fishy eyes, as if he had made an uncommonly liberal offer. As for Philip, he hardly knew whether to be angry or amused. “You offer me a dollar and sixty-four cents for my violin?” he repeated. “Yes. It\u0027s second-hand, to be sure, but I guess it\u0027s in pretty fair condition. Besides, you might help me a little about learnin\u0027 how to play.” “How much do you suppose the violin cost?” inquired Philip. “Couldn\u0027t say.” “It cost my father twenty-five dollars.” “Oh, come, now, that\u0027s too thin! You don\u0027t expect a feller to believe such a story as that?” “I expect to be believed, for I never tell anything but the truth.” “Oh, well, I don\u0027t expect you do, generally, but when it comes to tradin\u0027, most everybody lies,” observed Nick candidly. “I have no object in misrepresenting, for I don\u0027t want to sell the violin.” “You can\u0027t afford to keep it! The town won\u0027t let you!” “The town won\u0027t let me?” echoed Philip, now thoroughly mystified. “Of course they won\u0027t. The idea of a pauper bein\u0027 allowed a fiddle to play on! Why, it\u0027s ridiculous!” “What do you mean?” demanded Philip, who now began to comprehend the meaning of this thick-witted visitor. “What have I got to do with the town, or with paupers?” “Why, you\u0027re goin\u0027 to the poorhouse, ain\u0027t you?” “Certainly not!” answered Philip, with flashing eyes. “I guess you\u0027re mistaken,” said Nick coolly. “Squire Pope was over to our shop this mornin\u0027, and he told dad that the seleckmen were goin\u0027 to send you there after the auction.” Philip\u0027s eyes flashed angrily. He felt insulted and outraged. Never for a moment had he conceived the idea that any one would regard him as a candidate for the poorhouse. He had an honorable pride in maintaining himself, and would rather get along on one meal a day, earned by himself in honest independence, than be indebted to public charity even for a luxurious support. “Squire Pope doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s talking about,” retorted Philip, who had to exercise some self-restraint not to express himself more forcibly “and you can tell him so when you see him. I am no more likely to go to the poorhouse than you are!” “Come, that\u0027s a good one,” chuckled Nick. “Talk of me goin\u0027 to the poorhouse, when my father pays one of the biggest taxes in town! Of course, it\u0027s different with you.” “You\u0027ll have to excuse me now,” said Philip, determined to get rid of his disagreeable companion. “I have something to do.” “Then you won\u0027t sell me the fiddle, Phil?” “No, I won\u0027t,” answered our hero, with scant ceremony. “Then I\u0027ll have to bid it off at the auction. Maybe I\u0027ll get it cheaper.” And Mr. Nicholas Holden at length relieved Philip of his company. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015/83327.html","bookId":276,"book":{"id":276,"title":"The Young Musician or, Fighting His Way","description":"简介： As for the boy, said Squire Pope, with his usual autocratic air, I shall place him in the poorhouse.But, Benjamin, said gentle Mrs. Pope, who had a kindly and sympathetic heart, isn\u0027t that a little hard?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
