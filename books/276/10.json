{"id":8378,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. BAD TIDINGS.","content":"Leaving Philip for a short time in the hands of his captor, we will follow Zeke on his errand. He didn\u0027t have to go as far as Mr. Dunbar\u0027s house, for he met Frank Dunbar about a quarter of a mile this side of it. Now, between Frank Dunbar and Zeke Tucker there was no love lost. There had been a difficulty between them, originating at school, which need not be particularly referred to. Enough that it led to Zeke\u0027s cordially disliking Frank, while the latter, who was a frank, straightforward boy, could not see anything in Mr. Tucker\u0027s promising son to enlist either his respect or his liking. There was a small river running through Norton, which crossed the main thoroughfare, and had to be bridged over. Frank Dunbar, fishing-line in hand, was leaning over the parapet, engaged in luring the fish from their river home. He looked up, when he saw Zeke approaching him. Not having any particular desire to hold a conversation with him, he withdrew his eyes, and again watched his line. Zeke, however, approached him with a grin of anticipated enjoyment, and hailed him in the usual style: “Hello, Frank!” “Oh, it\u0027s you, is it?” said Frank Dunbar indifferently. “Yes it\u0027s me. I suppose you thought it was somebody else,” chuckled Zeke, though Frank could see no cause for merriment. “Well, I see who it is now,” he responded. “Where is Phil Gray?” inquired Zeke, chuckling again. “Do you want to see him?” asked Frank, rather surprised. “Oh, no! I shall see him soon enough.” And again Zeke chuckled. Frank looked up. He was expecting Philip to join him, and was, in fact, waiting for him now. Zeke\u0027s mysterious merriment suggested that he might have met Philip—possibly bore some message from him. “Do you know anything about Phil?” asked Frank, looking fixedly at his visitor. “I reckon I do. I know all about him,” said Zeke, with evident enjoyment. “Well. If you have any message from him, let me hear it.” “You can\u0027t guess where he is,” blurted out Zeke. “He isn\u0027t in any trouble, is he?” asked Frank quickly. “No; he\u0027s safe enough. But you needn\u0027t expect to see him tonight.” “Why not?” demanded Frank, not yet guessing what was likely to detain his friend. “Because he\u0027s at our house,” chuckled Zeke. “Dad and Squire Pope have carried him to the poorhouse, and he\u0027s goin\u0027 to stay there for good.” This was a surprise. In his astonishment, Frank nearly let go his rod. He was eager now to question Zeke further. “You don\u0027t mean to say Phil has been carried to the poorhouse against his will?” he exclaimed. “I reckon he was anxious to go,” said Zeke. “Where was he when your father and Squire Pope committed this outrage?” said Frank indignantly. “I thought you\u0027d be mad,” said Zeke, with the same unpleasant chuckle. “Answer my question, or I\u0027ll pitch you into the river,” said Frank sternly. He did not mean what he said, but Zeke drew back in alarm. “Quit now! I didn\u0027t have nothin\u0027 to do with it,” said Zeke hastily. “Me and him was over in Haywood\u0027s pasture when dad come along with the squire in his wagon. Well, they made Phil get in, and that\u0027s all of it, except I promised I\u0027d come and tell your folks, so you needn\u0027t get scared or nothin\u0027 when he didn\u0027t come back to-night.” “He will come back to-night,” said Frank. “He won\u0027t stay in the poorhouse.” “Yes, he will. He can\u0027t help himself. Dad\u0027s goin\u0027 to lock him up in the attic. I guess he won\u0027t jump out of the window. Where you go-in\u0027! You ain\u0027t got through fishin\u0027, be you?” “Yes, I\u0027m through,” answered Frank, as he drew his line out of the water. “Just tell Phil when you go home that he\u0027s got friends outside who won\u0027t see him suffer.” “Say, ain\u0027t you goin\u0027 to give me nothin\u0027 for comin\u0027 to tell you!” asked Zeke, who was always intent on the main chance. Frank flung a nickel in his direction, which Zeke picked up with avidity. “I guess it pays to run errands when you can get paid twice,” he reflected complacently. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015/83334.html","bookId":276,"book":{"id":276,"title":"The Young Musician or, Fighting His Way","description":"简介： As for the boy, said Squire Pope, with his usual autocratic air, I shall place him in the poorhouse.But, Benjamin, said gentle Mrs. Pope, who had a kindly and sympathetic heart, isn\u0027t that a little hard?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
