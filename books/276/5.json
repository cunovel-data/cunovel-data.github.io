{"id":8373,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. AN ALLIANCE AGAINST PHILIP.","content":"Squire Pope was not a bad man, nor was he by nature a tyrant, but he was so fully convinced of his own superior judgment that he was in all things obstinately bent on having his own way. He had persuaded himself that our young hero, Philip, would be better off in the poorhouse than in a place where he could earn his own living, and no one could convince him to the contrary. As to the boy\u0027s feelings on the subject, he considered those of no importance. He had good reason to know that Philip would object to being an inmate of the almshouse, but he was determined that he should go there. In like manner, before the auction was over, he saw clearly that it would realize a sum more than sufficient to pay the funeral expenses of the late Mr. Gray and the few small bills outstanding against his estate, and that there was no necessity that Philip\u0027s violin should be sold, but none the less he resolved that it should be sold. “Shall I allow a young lad to dictate to me?” Squire Pope asked himself, in irritation. “Certainly not! I know better what is right than he. It is ridiculous that a town pauper should own a violin. Why, the next thing, we shall have to buy pianos for our almshouses, for the use of the gentlemen and ladies who occupy them. A violin, indeed!” This Squire Pope regarded as irresistible logic and withering sarcasm combined. He saw Philip go out of the cottage, but, as the sale was not over, he was unable to follow him. “Never mind, I\u0027ll fix him as soon as I have time,” he said to himself. “Back so soon? Is the auction over!” asked his friend, Frank Dunbar, who was engaged in splitting wood in the rear of the house. “No, Frank, not quite; but it\u0027s almost over..Who do you think bid on father\u0027s gold watch?” “I don\u0027t know.” “Nick Holden.” “He didn\u0027t get it, did he?” “I am glad to say not. Your father bought it.” “Did he! Why, he\u0027s got one watch already.” “I am glad he\u0027s got it. I couldn\u0027t bear to think of Nick Holden carrying my father\u0027s watch. He was disappointed about one thing besides.” “What was that?” “The violin. He went to Squire Pope, and complained that it was not in the sale.” “That\u0027s just like his impudence. What did the squire say?” “He came to me and ordered me to get it, so that it might be sold.” “Shall I get it for you, then?” “Not much!” answered Philip emphatically. “It is mine, as I have already told you. If the auction doesn\u0027t bring in enough to settle up everything, I may agree to sell it for a fair price; but I am sure, from the prices, that it won\u0027t be necessary.” “Squire Pope\u0027s a dreadful obstinate man,” said Frank doubtfully. “He may insist upon your selling the violin.” “Let him do it!” said Philip contemptuously. “I should like to see him get it. Where have you put it, Frank?” “Where Squire Pope won\u0027t be apt to find it—in an old chest up in the garret. It\u0027s full of old clothes, belonging to my grandfather, and hasn\u0027t been looked into by any one except me for years. I put it away under all the clothes at the bottom. No one knows where it is except you and me, not even mother.” “That\u0027s good. I guess we can defy the squire, then.” Half an hour later, Mr. Dunbar came home from the auction. Philip went to meet him. “Thank you for buying father\u0027s watch,” he said. “But for you, Nick Holden would have had it, and I should have been sorry for it.” “He was badly disappointed,” said Mr. Dunbar smiling. “But I didn\u0027t buy the watch for myself, Philip.” “For whom, then?” asked Philip, in some surprise. “For the one that has the best right to it—for you,” and the farmer took the watch from his pocket, and handed it to Philip. “But I haven\u0027t the money to pay for it, Mr. Dunbar,” said our hero. “Then I give it to you as a present,” said Mr. Dunbar. “I am very grateful,” said Philip; “but I ought not to accept it. You are too kind to me.” “Let me be the judge of that.” “Besides, it wouldn\u0027t be safe for me to take it. Squire Pope will try to get my violin away from me in order to sell it, and he would be sure to try to do the same by the watch if he found that I had it.” “But, Philip, I don\u0027t need the watch myself.” “Then, Mr. Dunbar, will you be kind enough to keep it for me, and when I can afford to pay for it, and there is no danger of its being taken from me, I will ask you for it. I shall be very glad, indeed, when I am older, to carry my father\u0027s watch, for I have seen it in his hands so often that it will constantly remind me of him.” “Perhaps that will be the best arrangement,” said Mr. Dunbar. “You might have it stolen from you, if you carried it yourself just at present. As you request, I will keep it, subject to your order; but I would rather let it be a gift from me, and not require you to pay for it.” “We won\u0027t talk about that now,” said Philip, smiling. “At any rate, you must let me thank you for your great kindness to me.” “Don\u0027t speak of that, Phil,” said the farmer kindly. “I had a great respect and liking for your father, and I verily believe my Frank loves you as well as if you were his own brother. So, come what may, you have a friend in our family.” “I indorse all that father says,” Frank said. And he extended his hand to Philip, who grasped it heartily. It warmed his heart to think that he had such good friends, though he was an orphan and alone in the world. After supper, Mr. Dunbar went to the village store, while Frank and Philip remained at home. Suddenly Frank said: “Philip, you are going to have a visitor, I guess.” “A visitor!” “Yes; I saw Squire Pope stumping along the road, nourishing his gold-headed cane. He is headed this way, and it\u0027s likely he is going to honor you with a call. He\u0027s got somebody with him, too. Who is it!” Philip shaded his eyes with his hand, for the Sun was near its setting, and shining with dazzling brightness from the quarter toward which he was looking. “It\u0027s Nick Holden!” he said. “So it is! What can he want?” “I understand very well. He wants my violin. He couldn\u0027t get it at the sale, so he has come here to see if he can\u0027t make me give it to him.” “And will you?” “You ought to know me better than to ask, Frank,” said Philip firmly. “Nick might as well have stayed away, for he won\u0027t accomplish anything.” Nick, however, held a different opinion. After Philip left the cottage, he had gone to Squire Pope, and cunningly asked: “Are you going to let Philip keep his fiddle in spite of you, squire?” “What do you mean, Nicholas?” demanded the squire, in a stately way. “Why, seems to me he\u0027s kinder settin\u0027 up his will agin yours. You say the fiddle shall be sold, and he says it shan\u0027t. He told me he didn\u0027t care what you said, he should keep it.” “Did he say that, Nicholas?” asked the squire, who felt that his dignity was outraged by such insolence. “I\u0027m sartain he did. He\u0027s pretty big feelin\u0027, Phil is. He always wants to have his own way.” “He will find that he can\u0027t defy me with impunity,” said the squire stiffly. “Just so. Then you\u0027ll sell me the fiddle?” “I will!” said the squire emphatically. “You won\u0027t ask too much, will you?” asked Nick anxiously. Now Squire Pope, who knew nothing of the price of violins, and had a very inadequate idea of their value, after some haggling on the part of Nick, agreed to sell him the instrument for two dollars and a half, and to see that it was delivered that evening. “Do you know where it is, Nicholas?” he asked. “Why, Phil is staying over at Frank Dunbar\u0027s, and I guess he\u0027s got it there somewhere. I guess we\u0027d better go over there and get it.” “Very well, Nicholas. After supper, if you will come to my house, I will go over there, and see that you have the instrument.” “All right, squire!” said Nick gleefully, “Phil will find that he can\u0027t have his own way this time.” “I apprehend he will,” said the squire complacently. Now the reader understands how it happened that Squire Pope and Nick Holden made a call on Philip. As to what passed at the interview, we must refer him to the next chapter.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015/83329.html","bookId":276,"book":{"id":276,"title":"The Young Musician or, Fighting His Way","description":"简介： As for the boy, said Squire Pope, with his usual autocratic air, I shall place him in the poorhouse.But, Benjamin, said gentle Mrs. Pope, who had a kindly and sympathetic heart, isn\u0027t that a little hard?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
