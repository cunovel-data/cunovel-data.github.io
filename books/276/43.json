{"id":8411,"no":43,"title":"CHAPTER XLIII. A WELCOME LETTER.","content":"Alexander Taylor, a Wall Street broker, sat at breakfast in his fine house on Madison Avenue. His daughter, Jennie, about thirteen years old, was the only other person at the table. “Papa, have you heard nothing of Henry?” asked the little girl anxiously. “Only that the boy who got started with him on his foolish tramp got back three days since.” “Is Tom Murray back, then?” “Yes; he showed himself more sensible than Henry.” “Oh, I\u0027m afraid something\u0027s happened to him, papa! Why don\u0027t you advertise for him, or send out a detective, or something?” “I will tell you, Jennie,” said Mr. Taylor, laying down the morning paper. “I want your brother to stay away long enough to see his folly.” “But perhaps he may get out of money, and not be able to get anything to eat. You wouldn\u0027t want him to starve, papa?” “There isn\u0027t much chance of it. If he is in danger of that, he will have sense enough to ask for food, or to write to me for help. I rather hope he will have a hard time.” “Oh, papa!” “It will do him good. If I sent for him and brought him back against his will, he would probably start off again when he has a good chance.” Jennie could not quite follow her father in his reasoning, and was inclined to think him hard and unfeeling. She missed her brother, who, whatever his faults, treated her tolerably well, and was at any rate a good deal of company, being the only other young person in the house. Just then the servant entered with three letters, which he laid down beside his master\u0027s plate. Mr. Taylor hastily scanned the addresses. “Here is a letter from Henry,” he said, in a tone of satisfaction. “Oh, read it quick, papa!” This was the letter which Mr. Taylor read aloud, almost too deliberately for the impatience of his daughter: “Dear Father: I am alive and well, and hope to see you in a few days. I guess I made a mistake in running away, though I didn\u0027t think so at the time, for I wanted to see life, and have adventures. I don\u0027t know how I should have got along if I hadn\u0027t met Philip Gray. He\u0027s a tip-top fellow, and is paying my expenses. I told him you would pay him back. He has got me off the idea of going West to kill Indians.” “Oh, papa!” exclaimed Jennie, opening her eyes wide. “I didn\u0027t know that was what Henry went for.” “I don\u0027t think the Indians would have felt very much frightened if they had heard of his intention. However, I will proceed: “I was all out of money when Philip met me, and I hadn\u0027t had anything to eat since morning, he bought me some supper, and is paying my expenses. He is a poor boy, coming to New York to get a place, if he can. He has got a violin, and he plays beautifully. He earned all the money he has by giving concerts.” “I should like to see Philip,” said Jennie, with interest. “I asked him if he wouldn\u0027t go out West with me, but he wouldn\u0027t. He told me he wouldn\u0027t do anything for me unless I would agree to come home.” “He is a sensible boy,” commented Mr. Taylor, in a tone of approval. “We thought at first of coming right home on the cars, but I wanted to walk and see something of the country, and Philip said he didn\u0027t mind. He told me I must write and tell you, so that you needn\u0027t feel anxious. “You will see us in a few days. I will bring Philip to the house. Your son, HENRY TAYLOR.” “Is that all?” asked Jennie. “Yes; I consider it a very fair letter. It is evident Henry has made the acquaintance of a sensible boy. I shall take care that he doesn\u0027t let it drop.” \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015/83367.html","bookId":276,"book":{"id":276,"title":"The Young Musician or, Fighting His Way","description":"简介： As for the boy, said Squire Pope, with his usual autocratic air, I shall place him in the poorhouse.But, Benjamin, said gentle Mrs. Pope, who had a kindly and sympathetic heart, isn\u0027t that a little hard?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
