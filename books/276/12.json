{"id":8380,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. A PAUPER\u0027S MEAL","content":"Half an hour later Philip heard a pounding on the door of his room. He was unable to open it, but he called out, loud enough for the outsider to hear: “Who is it?” “It\u0027s me—Zeke,” was the answer that came back. “Did you tell the Dunbars where I was?” asked Philip eagerly. “Yes.” “I shouldn\u0027t think you had time to go there and back,” said Philip, fearing that Zeke had pocketed his money and then played him false. But, as we know, he was mistaken in this. “I didn\u0027t go there,” shouted Zeke. “I met Frank on the bridge.” “What did he say?” “He was mad,” answered Zeke, laughing. “I thought he would be.” “Did he send any message to me?” asked Philip. “No; he stopped fishin\u0027 and went home.” Here the conversation was interrupted. The loud tones in which Zeke had been speaking, in order to be heard through the door, had attracted attention below. His father came to the foot of the attic stairs and demanded suspiciously: “What you doin\u0027 there, Zeke?” “Tryin\u0027 to cheer up Phil Gray,” answered Zeke jocosely. “He don\u0027t need any cheerin\u0027 up. He\u0027s all right. I reckon you\u0027re up to some mischief.” “No, I ain\u0027t.” “Come along down.” “All right, dad, if you say so. Lucky he didn\u0027t hear what I was sayin\u0027 about seein\u0027 Frank Dunbar,” thought Zeke. “He\u0027d be mad.” Presently there was another caller at Philip\u0027s room, or, rather, prison. This time it was Mr. Tucker himself. He turned the key in the lock and opened the door. Philip looked up inquiringly. “Supper\u0027s ready,” announced Joe. “You can come down if you want to.” Philip was provided with an appetite, but he did not relish the idea of going downstairs and joining the rest of Mr. Tucker\u0027s boarders. It would seem like a tacit admission that he was one of their number. Of course, he couldn\u0027t do without eating, but he had a large apple in his pocket when captured, and he thought that this would prevent his suffering from hunger for that night, at least, and he did not mean to spend another at the Norton poorhouse. The problem of to-morrow\u0027s supply of food might be deferred till then. “I don\u0027t care for any supper,” answered Philip. “Perhaps you expect your meals will be brought up to you?” said Mr. Tucker, with a sneer. “I haven\u0027t thought about it particularly,” said Philip coolly. “You may think you\u0027re spitin\u0027 me by not eatin\u0027 anything,” observed Mr. Tucker, who was rather alarmed lest Philip might have made up his mind to starve himself. This would be embarrassing, for it would make an investigation necessary. “Oh, no,” answered Philip, smiling; “that never came into my mind.” “I don\u0027t mind bringin\u0027 you up your supper for once,” said Tucker. “Of course, I can\u0027t do it reg\u0027lar, but this is the first night.” “I suppose I shall be better able to make my escape if I eat,” thought Philip. “Probably the most sensible thing is to accept this offer.” “How much are you to get for my board, Mr. Tucker?” he asked. “Only sixty cents,” grumbled Tucker. “It ain\u0027t enough, but the town won\u0027t pay any more. You\u0027ve no idea what appetites them paupers has.” “You made a mistake when you agreed to take me,” said Philip gravely. “I\u0027m very hearty, you\u0027ll be sure to lose money on me.” Mr. Tucker looked uneasy. “Well, you see I expect to have you earn part of your board by doin\u0027 chores,” he said, after a pause. “That will give me a good chance to run away,” remarked Philip calmly. “You\u0027ll have to let me out of this room to work, you know.” “You wouldn\u0027t dare to run away!” said Tucker, trying to frighten Philip by a blustering manner. “That shows you don\u0027t know me, Mr. Tucker!” returned our hero. “I give you fair warning that I shall run away the first chance I get.” Philip\u0027s tone was so calm and free from excitement that Mr. Tucker could not help seeing that he was in earnest, and he looked perplexed. “You don\u0027t look at it in the right light,” he said, condescending to conciliate his new boarder. “If you don\u0027t make no trouble, you\u0027ll have a good time, and I\u0027ll let you off, now an\u0027 then, to play with Zeke. He needs a boy to play with.” Philip smiled, for the offer did not attract him very much. “You are very kind,” he said, “but I don\u0027t think that even that will reconcile me to staying here with you. But, if you\u0027ll agree to let me pay you for the supper, you may bring me up some.” “The town will pay me,” said Tucker. “That\u0027s just what I don\u0027t want the town to do,” said Philip quickly. “I will make you an offer. At sixty cents a week the meals for one day will not cost over ten cents. I\u0027ll pay you ten cents for supper and breakfast.” “You\u0027re a cur\u0027us boy,” said Tucker. “You want to pay for your vittles in a free boardin\u0027-house.” “It isn\u0027t free to me. At any rate, I don\u0027t want it to be. What do you say?” “Oh, I ain\u0027t no objections to take your money,” said Tucker, laughing. “I didn\u0027t know you was so rich.” “I am not rich, but I think I can pay my board as long as I stay here.” This Philip said because he had decided that his stay should be a very brief one. “Just as you say!” chuckled Mr. Tucker. As he went downstairs he reflected: “I can take the boy\u0027s money and charge his board to the town, too. There\u0027s nothin\u0027 to hen-der, and it\u0027ll be so much more in my pocket. I wish the rest of the paupers would foller his example.” He went downstairs and explained to Mrs. Tucker that he wanted Philip\u0027s supper. “Tell him to come down to the table like the rest of the folks!” retorted Mrs. Tucker. “He ain\u0027t too lazy, is he?” “No; but it\u0027s safer to keep him in his room for the first twenty-four hours. He\u0027s a desperate boy, but I reckon he\u0027ll get tamed after a while.” “I\u0027ll desperate him!” said Mrs. Tucker scornfully. “I don\u0027t believe in humorin\u0027 him.” “Nor I, Abigail. He\u0027d like to come down, but I won\u0027t let him. We can manage him between us.” “I should smile if we couldn\u0027t,” said Mrs. Tucker. “If you want any supper for him, you can get it yourself. I\u0027ve got too much to do. No, Widder Jones, you can\u0027t have another cup of tea, and you needn\u0027t beg for it. One clip\u0027s plenty for you, and it\u0027s all we can afford.” “Only this once,” pleaded the poor old woman. “I\u0027ve got a headache.” “Then another cup of tea would only make it worse. If you\u0027ve got through your supper, go back to your seat and give more room for the rest.” While Mrs. Tucker was badgering and domineering over her regular boarders, her husband put two slices of dry bread on a plate, poured out a cup of tea, not strong enough to keep the most delicate child awake, and surreptitiously provided an extra luxury in the shape of a thin slice of cold meat. He felt that, as he was to receive double price, he ought to deal generously by our hero. He carried this luxurious supper to the third story, and set it down before Philip. Philip promptly produced a dime, which Mr. Tucker pocketed with satisfaction. He waited till his young guest had finished his repast, in order himself to carry down the dishes. There was no butter for the bread, and the tea had been sweetened scantily. However, Philip had the appetite of a healthy boy, and he ate and drank everything that had been provided. “I\u0027ll be up in the morning,” said Mr. Tucker. “We go to bed early here. The paupers go to roost at seven, and me and my wife and Zeke at eight. You\u0027d better go to bed early, too.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015/83336.html","bookId":276,"book":{"id":276,"title":"The Young Musician or, Fighting His Way","description":"简介： As for the boy, said Squire Pope, with his usual autocratic air, I shall place him in the poorhouse.But, Benjamin, said gentle Mrs. Pope, who had a kindly and sympathetic heart, isn\u0027t that a little hard?...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3015","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
