{"id":42610,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. RED RALPH.","content":"The man who entered was of medium height, thickset, and his hair and beard were red. His face was far from prepossessing. He looked at the visitors, and then at his wife inquiringly. \"So you have company?\" he said. \"Yes, Ralph,\" answered the woman, rather nervously. \"I told them we didn\u0027t keep a hotel, but they offered me five dollars to take care of them and the horse till morning.\" The man\u0027s face lost its scowl. The sum offered made an impression. \"You did right,\" he said. \"I am willing to accommodate. Where\u0027s the horse?\" \"We put him in the barn.\" \"All right. And where may you be from?\" he asked, addressing the earl. \"I am an Englishman.\" \"Are you in any business?\" [Pg 228] \"Not at present.\" \"But you have money?\" This remark was accompanied by a look of keen curiosity. \"I have some,\" answered the earl, cautiously. \"He is going to buy out a store in Buffalo,\" put in the woman. \"What sort of a store?\" \"I haven\u0027t decided yet,\" replied the earl, who did not choose to take the man into his confidence. \"It takes a power of money to buy a store.\" \"It depends on the nature of the business, I should think.\" \"About how much do you mean to invest?\" \"Really, the fellow is getting impertinent,\" thought his guest. \"I don\u0027t think I can answer that question,\" he answered. Their host took from a shelf a dirty clay pipe, filled it with tobacco, and began to smoke. The fumes were far from pleasant, and the earl, rising from his chair, signaled to Scott to go outside with him. \"Where are you going?\" asked the red-haired man. \"We are going to take a walk.\" [Pg 229] \"Has he paid you the five dollars?\" asked the man, addressing his wife. \"No.\" \"Then you may as well hand it over,\" said the host. \"Certainly, if you wish it now.\" \"That is safest. You might take your horse and give us the slip. Then we\u0027d be so much out.\" \"What do you take us for?\" demanded the earl, indignantly. \"I don\u0027t know anything about you. You may be gentlemen, or——\" \"This will settle the question,\" and the earl took out his wallet, and from a thick roll of bills picked out a five-dollar note, and handed it to the woman. \"Give it here to me, Sarah,\" said her husband, sharply. \"I take charge of the money.\" With meek obedience she passed the bill to him. He scrutinized it closely, but the result of his inspection seemed to be favorable, and he put it away in his vest pocket. Scott noticed that he had regarded the roll of bills with a covetous glance, and he felt that the earl had been imprudent in making such a display of his money. [Pg 230] \"It\u0027s all right,\" their host said, slowly. \"You\u0027re an honest man. You pay your bills.\" The earl smiled, and opening the outer door, went out, followed by Scott. \"What do you think of our host, Scott?\" he asked. \"I distrust him, Mr. Grant. I am sorry you showed him that roll of bills.\" \"It may have been imprudent, but I don\u0027t think there is any danger of his attempting to rob me.\" \"He was curious to learn your business. I wonder what his is.\" \"To-morrow we shall leave the house, and we are never likely to meet him again,\" said the earl, indifferently. \"So it is hardly worth thinking about.\" They strolled along in a leisurely way, and sat down under a tree, about a mile distant from their home. Under the same tree reclined a young man who looked like a farmer or a farmer\u0027s assistant. \"Good-evening,\" said the earl, courteously. \"Good-evening, sir.\" \"Do you live hereabouts?\" \"Yes, I am working for my uncle, who owns a farm not far from here. You are a stranger, are you not?\" [Pg 231] \"Yes, my friend and myself are staying at Niagara. We were taking a long drive, but the horse went lame, and we engaged lodgings for the night about a mile from here.\" \"At what house?\" asked the young man. \"I will tell you, and you can perhaps tell me something of the man who occupies it.\" The young man listened to the description, and when it was finished shrugged his shoulders. \"I shouldn\u0027t care to be in your place,\" he said. \"Why not?\" \"Red Ralph doesn\u0027t have a very good reputation,\" he explained. \"Is that what he is called?\" \"Yes. You noticed his profusion of red hair. His real name is Moody, I believe, but everybody calls him Red Ralph.\" \"How long has he lived in this neighborhood?\" \"About three years.\" \"What is his business, or, rather, how does he make his living?\" \"That is hard to tell. I believe he trades in horses to some extent.\" \"Is nothing known of his history before he came here?\" \"It is reported that he has been in jail. A[Pg 232] man who saw him there said that he was quite confident he had seen him in a visit to Joliet prison.\" \"Is his life reputable? Has he ever been in any trouble since he came here?\" \"Nothing has been proved against him, but more than one rough-looking man has been seen in his house.\" \"Decidedly, Scott,\" said the earl, \"we have not been fortunate in our selection of a lodging house. However, it is only for one night.\" \"Have you much money with you?\" asked their new acquaintance. \"A tolerably large sum,\" answered the earl. \"Then, I advise you to bolt your door when you retire.\" \"I shall do so. Without knowing anything of our worthy host, I had formed an unfavorable opinion of him before I spoke with you.\" \"He will bear watching,\" said the young man, briefly. \"What could have been his object in establishing himself here? If he is a rogue, I don\u0027t see what opportunities he has of practicing dishonesty.\" \"Bear in mind that this house is not many miles from the border. If he committed a robbery in[Pg 233] the States, he could easily take refuge in his Canadian home, where he would be safe from arrest.\" \"There is something in that.\" \"If you don\u0027t care to remain in his house overnight, I think I could insure you a welcome from my uncle, who lives not far away.\" \"Thank you, but it would be awkward to make a change at this late hour. Besides, what explanation could we give?\" \"Still, if you distrust him——\" \"There is another consideration. We have paid in advance,\" suggested Scott. \"I should not mind forfeiting five dollars,\" said the earl. \"There is one thing I should mind more.\" \"What is that?\" \"To leave now would be a confession of cowardice. We ought—the two of us—to be a match for Red Ralph.\" \"I will do my share,\" said Scott, smiling. \"Yes, you look like a brave boy.\" Then, turning to the young man, \"I thank you for your kind offer, but I think we will stay with Red Ralph for this one night.\" Already it was getting dark, and the air was chill. \"Let us go back, Scott,\" said the earl. \"It is[Pg 234] not very late, but I feel sleepy, and I think I shall retire early.\" \"Very well, sir.\" It was not quite nine o\u0027clock when they entered the farmhouse. There was a fire of logs in the fireplace, and before it, with his legs stretched out, sat Red Ralph. But he was not alone. A man of dark complexion sat opposite him. He was tall and swarthy, and, though differing in appearance seemed a fitting companion for Red Ralph. Both had pipes in their mouths, and the room was pervaded by the fumes of bad tobacco. \"Well, stranger, you took a long walk,\" said Red Ralph, turning in his chair. \"We sat down under a tree to rest,\" responded the earl. \"Can we have a candle?\" The woman got up from her chair at the back of the room and lighted one. \"Come with me,\" she said, \"and I will show you your chamber.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2037/57989.html","bookId":614,"book":{"id":614,"title":"The Young Salesman","description":"简介： Halfway across the Atlantic the good ship Arcturus was making her way from Liverpool to New York.
