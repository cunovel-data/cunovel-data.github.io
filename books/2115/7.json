{"id":92583,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"I SEE THE Vegas entertainment scene has gotten dark and dangerous,\" Helena Burnside commented as the cab dropped us off at the Inferno entrance at 9:00 P.M.\n Manny was there to sweep open the SUV\u0027s sliding door for us.\n \"Welcome back, Miss Street. I\u0027m sorry to see Dolly has not accompanied you.\"\n \"Dolly?\" Helena asked after I\u0027d tipped Manny and we were walking inside. \"And just what is that parking valet\u0027s, ah... derivation?\"\n \"A low-order demon, usually harmless. Not that he wouldn\u0027t snap up a careless soul if he could.\"\n \"And... Dolly is a friend of yours?\"\n \"My car. Demons love classic cars and Dolly is choice.\"\n She eyed me hard. \"You named your car Dolly?\"\n \"She\u0027s an estate-sale cream puff, a \u002756 Caddy Biarritz with pointed chrome bumper bullets up front that could take out a tank nest.\"\n \"Oh? Oh. My, this town is colorful, and so are you.\"\n \"As you noted, my stuffy outfit was for the benefit of the resident D.C. bureaucrat.\"\n \"I bet you show my boy a whole different side.\"\n \"He\u0027s shown me a whole different side of myself.\"\n \"It\u0027s that way. I see. What should I expect with him, Delilah?\"\n By then we were in the elevator wafting upward.\n \"That\u0027s why I went to you. He\u0027s been healing well but is still comatose. I think his mental state needs expert addressing.\"\n \"You aren\u0027t the person he\u0027d most respond to?\"\n I couldn\u0027t say that he\u0027d already responded to me way above and beyond the call of mortality just by staying alive.\n \"He\u0027s gone so deep inside himself the present is lost. I think he needs to come back from his past.\"\n \"A rather profound analysis, Delilah. Thanks for getting me here.\"\n \"Thanks for coming.\"\n We smiled at each other outside the suite.\n \"Bridal Suite,\" she read aloud from the embossed gold plaque beside the double doors. \"Is this a portent of the future?\"\n \"It\u0027s what the hotel owner had free and big enough to accommodate around-the-clock nursing care.\"\n \"A most accommodating hotel owner. Any reason why?\"\n \"Christophe is quite a... prominent figure around Vegas. It\u0027s hard to know what his motives are.\"\n \"Yet you accepted his generosity.\"\n The statement, although true, grated on my sense of independence.\n \"I didn\u0027t have a choice. Ric wouldn\u0027t want his condition made public and paparazzi always stake out Vegas hospitals hunting celebrities and sensational stories. Human hyenas. That could compromise Ric\u0027s government consulting work and he\u0027d hate that.\"\n She nodded. \"So would Philip.\" I saw Helena gather herself, despite her formidable poise. \"Well, shall we see the patient?\"\n \"I\u0027M SO GLAD you\u0027re back, Miss Street,\" a frazzled nurse said. \"Our patient is getting fractious about having a sponge bath and your dog is not having any of it either.\"\n Sponge bath? In a way that was a good sign. It showed that Ric\u0027s deeply ingrained reflexes to keep people from seeing his disfigured back were still operative.\n \"This is Mr. Montoya\u0027s mother,\" I said. \"She\u0027s a doctor.\" So I was fudging between a medical and academic title...\n \"Dr. Helena Troy Burnside, Georgetown University.\" His mother extended a hand. \"Thank you for taking such good care of my boy.\"\n \"Of course we would. To see such a young and handsome man so unmoving...\" She choked up, perhaps envisioning Ric through a mother\u0027s eyes.\n Helena Troy Burnside actually was doing that, but was married to sterner stuff and quashed the emotion. \"Forget the sponge bath for today. I\u0027d like to examine him first myself, then spend some time evaluating his condition.\"\n The nurse nodded, swept open one of the double doors to the bedroom suite, and stood back.\n Quicksilver waited inside, muzzle lifted over his intimidating teeth like a black awning. He thrust up his snout to verify my and the nurse\u0027s familiar scents, and assign one to Helena.\n \"It\u0027s okay, Quick,\" I told him. \"Ric\u0027s mother is here to see him.\"\n The dog backed off to the side but remained alert. Even Helena lost her eternal composure enough to sidle past, eyes averted. She\u0027d be very steadying to distraught and disoriented patients.\n Once she glimpsed the hospital bed accessorized by metal medical equipment poles and tangled cords, she moved tensely forward, leaning over Ric.\n \"Delilah,\" she said without looking over her shoulder, \"you probably keep more comfortable clothes here. Go ahead and change while I see what\u0027s what with Ric.\" She sank onto the chair\u0027s edge, setting her belongings on the floor and leaning forward to take his hand in both of hers.\n With Helena here to fend off unwanted back exposure and Quicksilver on guard, I slipped away, yearning to switch my confining fifties clothes for low-heeled mules, low-riding jeans, and a simple knit top.\n The bridal suite offered separate bedrooms for overnight relatives. I\u0027d chosen the nearest one. I changed fast and skittered back into the main area to find Snow there. Rats! We\u0027d arrived right between his 7:30 and 10:00 P.M. shows.\n \"Where have you been?\" he asked.\n I wanted to snap, None of your business, but since he was providing everything Ric needed, I bridled my tongue and thoughts.\n \"I fetched Ric\u0027s mother. She\u0027s a famous psychologist.\"\n \"A medium might do more good,\" Snow suggested. \"So he\u0027s still comatose?\"\n I nodded.\n \"May I meet the mother or do you want to stand there glaring at me all night?\"\n Looking him over, I weighed whether a skintight be-jeweled leather jumpsuit was too much glitter-rock macho for a dignified middle-aged professional woman. I finally nodded permission. It would do Snow good to meet a formidable female who wasn\u0027t rock idol bait.\n He shook his mane of white hair. \"I don\u0027t know whether you or your dog is the fiercer bodyguard.\"\n \"Someone who uses a white tiger for a security chief is hardly one to talk.\"\n He passed me without further comment and entered the bedroom, me following and wondering how Ric\u0027s mother would handle a long-haired albino wearing sunglasses.\n At our approach she looked up, then gave a little coo and said, \"Oh, my God! It\u0027s Cocaine. I saw your farewell show in D.C. when the Sins were still touring. Helena Troy Burnside.\"\n You could have picked my tongue off the floor and rolled it up like a very long cigarette paper.\n \"They were fabulous,\" she gurgled on. \"You were fabulous.\"\n Helena Troy Burnside a Snow groupie?\n He smiled politely, an expression I\u0027d never seen before.\n \"I own the Inferno now. The road life gets old. I\u0027ll get you mosh-pit passes to the show.\" He turned to regard me over his shoulder. \"I\u0027m sure Miss Street would love to accompany you, and her dog is all the security your son needs, believe me.\"\n \"Oh, I believe you,\" she answered, while I ground my teeth at their incredible coziness. Snow was a very unreliable witness on all counts as far as I was concerned.\n \"Meanwhile,\" he said, \"consider yourself a guest of the Inferno, with the use of an adjoining bedroom. Anything from the hotel restaurants and shops that you need or desire may be charged to the room, gratis.\"\n \"Anything that I desire?\"\n She let the question hang to the point of flirtation. I supposed Snow could use that Ole White Magic anytime, on any woman. Except me.\n \"I desire my son\u0027s recovery,\" she added with a smile. \"I won\u0027t need to stay long but much appreciate your princely hospitality. Delilah didn\u0027t tell me who our host was.\"\n \"She probably didn\u0027t want to ruin the surprise. She\u0027s that way. Likes to keep things to herself to tease and intrigue and enchant others.\"\n \"Really?\" Helena let her clear blue gaze rest on me. It was as demandingly honest as Quicksilver\u0027s. \"She\u0027s something of a magician. But then, so is a charismatic stage performer like you. If I need to stay overnight, I\u0027ll try to make your show, but I doubt I will. Ric seems to be doing well under your generous care.\"\n He nodded and left without another glance at me, although with those dark sunglasses who could be sure?\n \"I had no idea,\" I told her, \"that you were a fan.\"\n \"Oh, I wasn\u0027t. My resident fifteen-year-old boy, though, wanted to impress a girl who was, so I provided wheels and chaperoning.\"\n \"Did he-?\"\n \"Who, Ric?\"\n \"No, Snow.\"\n \"\u0027Snow?\u0027 Oh, of course. A natural nickname. You must know him well.\"\n \"Can anybody really know a man who wears sunglasses all the time?\"\n \"His albino eyes must be ultrasensitive to light.\"\n Yeah, like the \"light of truth.\"\n \"Did Snow give the so-called Brimstone Kiss to the mosh-pit groupies then?\" I finally asked.\n \"Oh, yes. Ric\u0027s would-be girlfriend was suitably impressed. She jumped higher than all the other teenyboppers, and some pretty mature women, in fact, to snag a kiss. Funny, that reminds me that they never dated after that. Guess Ric didn\u0027t like the competition.\"\n Or the girl had no time for fifteen-year-old Ric after getting the Brimstone Kiss. That, at least, wasn\u0027t going to happen to me. I still would rather hiss and spit at Snow than kiss him. Maybe I was exaggerating my anger to ensure my independence. Whatever worked.\n I turned the conversation back to Ric. \"You sound like you\u0027re not staying long.\"\n \"Don\u0027t have to. I\u0027ve already established a deep suggestive state in Ric.\"\n \"You used hypnotism on him?\"\n \"Long ago, yes. Now, I just have to draw on our common memory bank, as it were, and run the images through my mind. I\u0027m rebooting his consciousness, you could say, overpowering the evil done to him with a speed-reading course in good nostalgia. He\u0027ll awaken and act normally soon. He\u0027ll slowly recall what happened to him only when his subconscious fully ramps up over the next several days. The shock will be muted, like a bad dream. The pain will be distant.\"\n She bent over to lay her cheek on his hand, then straightened with a happy sigh.\n \"Since you\u0027ve bonded with him, you should be able to do something of the sort too. Just sit by him, remembering the happy times. You can even remember the hot times.\" She laughed to see my latest blush. \"Men respond very strongly to such stimuli. He could do worse than come to consciousness again with a wet dream. This is a bridal suite, after all.\n \"I\u0027d suggest you reinstitute sex with him before he\u0027s totally himself again. That immediate and pleasant sensory memory will do more to override the ugliness than anything I can do.\"\n Imagine. A guy\u0027s \"mother\" prescribing sex to his girlfriend. Helena Troy Burnside was a cool lady, just like Irma said.\n She stood and gazed down on him. \"I\u0027m so proud of him. He overcame so much to become the strong, confident, well-adjusted man you fell in love with. This won\u0027t knock him down again now that he has you. Trust me.\"\n \"You\u0027re leaving? You told Snow you might not-\"\n \"I could hardly tell a rock idol that I don\u0027t have time to accept a personal invitation to his show. I\u0027ll instruct the nurses not to disturb Ric until tomorrow.\"\n She eyed me oddly. \"I have a feeling that you can heal Ric more than I can. Sit by him for the night. I\u0027ve opened his mind and senses to pleasant things. Your love is what he needs now. Don\u0027t be afraid to give it no matter what form it takes.\"\n \"But-\"\n \"Philip will be anxious for a firsthand report. I\u0027ll catch a cab outside. This is Las Vegas. Getting in and out of town is a snap, particularly with a private plane waiting. Call me anytime to report or ask questions. I\u0027ve left my card on the bedside table. Perhaps Ric will bring you home for Thanksgiving.\"\n She embraced me lightly at the door, her smooth, mineral-powdered cheek brushing mine. For an instant after she\u0027d left, I felt a sickening replay of interviews at the group home with prospective adoptive parents who never returned after that first meeting with me. I felt abandoned and swallowed a lump of concrete in my throat.\n Get a grip, Irma told me. Be glad she\u0027s not the clingy mother type. She\u0027s a smart one. You saved Ric\u0027s life, now you get to have him to yourself and be the light of his eyes when he comes fully conscious. Enjoy, Street! You so do not get that part of things.\n I walked to the wall of windows. The Strip was lighting up as the sun had set and blackness pooled over the valley. It was that magic twilight time just past sunset when Vegas\u0027s garish self-advertisement felt easy and muted.\n A deep breath cleared my mind and emotions but I was still tired. I put Quicksilver on guard in the main room, where his food and water dishes were kept, and walked back to the double doors and up the single step to Ric\u0027s bed.\n The nurses had settled down in their rooms and one would give Quicksilver his evening walk, she told me.\n That must be a sight on the Strip!\n I sat in the chair Helena Burnside had left, watching Ric. His mother was confident he\u0027d be all right, why couldn\u0027t I be? Maybe because I feared the Resurrection Kiss as much as I\u0027d feared the Brimstone Kiss. Or more. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-sunrise-delilah-street-3/page-7.html","bookId":2115,"book":{"id":2115,"title":"Vampire Sunrise (Delilah Street #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Sunrise (Delilah Street #3) \n Werewolf mobsters and vampires run Vegas, but that\u0027s yesterday\u0027s news for Delilah Street, paranormal investigator.
