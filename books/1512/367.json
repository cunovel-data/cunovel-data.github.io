He didn’t consider the twists and turns of the roads. Bugs were fortunately little here. He hadn’t seen one yet as he followed the road in between the fungi.\\n\\n Sizz! Zero instinctively rolled forward. A silver light pierced through a fungus and headed toward his location. He was in his mid-roll when the light passed by barely touching him. It continued onward piercing through all the fungi on the way. Zero could heard the collapses of those fungi.\\n\\n “Stop hiding. You aren’t going to make it. Just let me kill you in one shot. That will make you suffer less. If you make me lose this bet, I will burn you inch by inch from toe to head with my Silver Blaze. Make your choice. Either die in an instant or from torture. Tell me, swine!” His voice came from the outside of this area. Another silver light shot through along with his words. However, it missed Zero by a meter this time.\\n\\n Zero noted this shot. He understood such long distance sniping couldn’t be completed solely by psyche scan. The scan gave you the target’s location but not being able to see the distance with your eyes would introduce some error. This was why he chose such an environment.\\n\\n Zero immediately raised his rifle at the direction where the silver light came from and fired. Bang! Was the sound from the Gauss sniper rifle then it was immediately followed by a Dong! The sound of striking a bell with a rock. Both sounds were so out of place in this underground world. Zero instantly continued to run deep into the fungi forest.\\n\\n Two seconds after he started running, a silver light crossed his previous location just like he had expected. The man roared with rage like when a cat had its tail stepped on. His tolerance was thin and he started firing like a maniac. Several more shots later, he stepped into the ruin he caused and walked to where Zero was. He gave a cold smile. “Fine. I will burn you to nothingness inch by inch!”\\n\\n Bang! Dong!\\n\\n Another loud shot. The powerful bullet went straight for Nick. A golden light formed an ancient bell and enveloped him inside. The bullet could only strike the bell ineffectively.\\n\\n “Are you an idiot? How many times do I have to tell you this is a BB defensive item? Your sci-fi weapon can’t damage me even one bit. It will only expose your location!” He gave a cold laugh then drew his bow and fired at the fungi forest ahead. A circulating light filled the silver bow. The light then concentrated on its string. When he released the string, a silver light fired out.\\n\\n Yet, this shot was as useless as the previous ones. Zero dodged the light before it hit. Nick grew more enraged and started cursing. The end of five minutes was coming near. Nick was also getting impatient.\\n\\n “I get it, swine! You forced me to do this! I thought to give you an easy death but it seems like you have to get torn to pieces!” Nick shouted.\\n\\n He brought out a silver coin from his pocket and put it on the string of the bow. The coin fused with the circulating light as he drew the string. He released the string with a shout. Numerous light beams fired from the bow. The single puddle of silver light from before changed into tiny beams. There were at least ten thousand beams that devoured the fungi in front of him.\\n\\n Zero was still running. His sense of danger raised to an extreme when Nick changed his shot. Zero glanced behind with his peripheral vision and saw the light beams coming at him. The number of these beams gave him a sense that it was unavoidable. I remained abnormally calm at this critical moment. The beams’ path covered the area around him and the area in front of him. He turned around and ran back without a moment of thought.\\n\\n The beams were an AOE ability that covered up to a hundred meters. Their only flaw was a decrease in speed. The first beam reached Zero after he took four steps. Time seemingly froze for him. Zero felt the world slowed down. His movements also slowed down. It looked like there was no way to avoid being hit by the beams.\\n\\n Less than a meter left. Zero eyes defocused. He had no time to change any movement from the running. His foot kicked on the root of a fungus then he used this force to throw himself forward on the ground. The beams flew over his head and back, almost touching them. He could feel the heat so clearly. Time was slow during this moment. As soon as all the beams flew by, he immediately jumped up.\\n\\n This was the first time Zero experienced this feeling of near omniscience. Endless information from the surrounding streamed into his head. He could see the condition of his body, his strength, his stamina, his speed, the power of those beams, and even what action he should take next. He immediately brought out a Gauss explosive bullet without hesitation.\\n\\n Nick was a few hundred meters away from Zero. He was closing in but Zero was safe switching to this bullet. He fired back at where the light beams came from. The same bang as regular bullets. The same sound of striking a bell. Zero got back down on the ground after firing. A heat wave swept over him.\\n\\n Nick was waiting for the notification from God. However, it never came to his irritation. What came back was a shot from the Gauss sniper rifle. He cursed to himself and thought, did this person from team China also had a defensive item? One high ranked enough to defend against magical weapons?\\n\\n The bullet that struck the bell didn’t drop to the ground this time. It flashed brilliantly instead. Nick heard a loud sound followed by violent vibrations and the wavering of the bell. The bell protected him from damage but the ground couldn’t withstand the explosion. He was blasted up dozens of meters into the sky. The heat waves from the explosion then threw him back down into the fungi like a bullet. He was struck several meters into the ground.\\n\\n Zero immediately ran toward the densely populated fungi forest afterward. He heard about the pain of unlocking the genetic constraint for the first time. If this shot didn’t kill the man, he had to suffer through this pain in a hidden place before continuing the fight, continue until he killed the enemy!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-14-chapter-24-03","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
