To be accurate, it was a Western fantasy movie, with knights, swords, magic and giant dragons. It was a wholly Western fantasy world, and this movie world was exactly the one team China was entering now.\\n\\n From the analysis of the two brains of team China, this movie world wasn’t difficult. At least to the current team China, it didn’t pose much difficulty. So why did such an easy movie suddenly appear at this time? The verdict of the two brains was shockingly unanimous… The final battle was coming, and God wanted to supplement the rest of team China’s battle power, such as the young dragon they had obtained long ago.\\n\\n In the Jurassic Park movie, team China had met a real Western dragon, with a colossal body as long as a hundred metres. Everytime it breathed out flames, it had destructive power on par with a miniature nuclear bomb. If Zheng hadn’t risked his life as he fought at that time and used the extraordinarily destructive power of Destruction, team China at that time may have all died under that giant dragon’s mouth.\\n\\n Eragon was indeed a movie world portraying giant dragons. The giant dragons inside naturally couldn’t compare to the giant dragon team China had faced. They were at most ten metres long, like large lizards, and completely couldn\u0027t compare to that one hundred metre long giant dragon with fire breath as destructive as miniature nuclear bombs and immunity to long range high tech weapons. In this movie, this lizard-like dragon could instantaneously mature into a large dragon, and maturing was exactly what team China’s young dragon needed!\\n\\n “Although that’s the case, but if it really does mature, how are we supposed to bring a hundred metre long dragon into the horror movie worlds? Using the Tamer Medallion you mentioned that needs a rank B reward to exchange? Can a non-humanoid be put inside? What is it…” Cheng Xiao was carrying a small badge, his expression strange as he asked.\\n\\n That badge was actually something Zheng had exchanged. After he had obtained the leader position, the search authority had returned. When he had been researching how to bring in a hundred metre long dragon into the movie worlds, he had found an item named Tamer’s Medallion among the exchangeable equipment. Allegedly, it was an equipment for strengthening Tamers, to complement the Tamer enhancement that God had. When Tamers were enhanced to the Grandmaster Tamer, they could summon non-human life forms as their magical pets. This medallion was exactly an equipment for storing large non-human organisms.\\n\\n “That’s right.” Zheng took the badge, and looked at the young dragon sleeping lazily in his embrace. “This little dragon treats me as its family, so there’s no need to exchange the Tamer enhancement to control it. What I’m worried about isn’t this. What I’m worried is that this almost overly rushed method of helping it grow may harm it… Even if we want this battle power, I really don’t want to harm it. This little dragon as pure as a baby. Things regarding slaughter are still very far off for it.”\\n\\n At this moment, everyone was in Eragon, and the time period was when the main character had just obtained the dragon egg, and the movie had just started.\\n\\n Eragon was a standard Western fantasy movie. The plot was that in an unknown country, there had been a corps of Dragon Riders. They had possessed great power due to their mounts, and had become the true owners of this country. This situation had come to an end when a certain Dragon Rider appeared. This Dragon Rider had possessed the strongest giant dragon and was treacherous and vicious. He was also crafty, and under his schemes, the entire kingdom was embroiled in the chaos of war. Dragon Riders fought each other, to the extent where large numbers of them and their mounts fell. The strongest Dragon Rider became the king of this entire country, and used military force and magic to rule the entire kingdom. To ensure his rule lasted long, he began to hunt and kill the remaining Dragon Riders. In reality, there wasn’t even one Dragon Rider left in this movie world except for the king. All that was left was one dragon egg. The entire movie was a story about the youth who picked up the dragon egg maturing step by step until he became a qualified Dragon Rider.\\n\\n The place everyone appeared in was the small village where the protagonist stayed at the very beginning. It was a poor village with population not exceeding a hundred, with a few wandering warriors. Generally, this village was a more peaceful one, and the battles between Dragon Riders seemed very far off. They appeared at the fringe of the village, and were already used to the pattern for this kind of fantasy movies. When the movie started, Zheng brought everyone to hide in the forest outside the village. Thus, even though two days had already passed in the movie world, they hadn’t yet been discovered by the people of the movie world. \\n\\n “Zero, what’s the matter? Has the main character Eragon obtained the dragon egg?” Zheng looked at Zero and Yingkong who had returned from the village. Having these two, one close combat and one long distance, as team China’s scouts wasn’t bad. With their fighting capabilities, they wouldn’t attract the attention of the people in the village. Even without a psyche force user, they had easily scouted out the main character Eragon’s situation.\\n\\n Zero silently nodded his head. “Yes. He’s obtained the dragon egg. Just like in the movie plot, he doesn’t know it’s a dragon egg, but thinks it’s just a strange rock… What should we do? Snatch that dragon egg now? Until when it hatches, and let that young dragon bring our young dragon along in maturing?”\\n\\n Zheng silently considered for a while. He then shook his head and spoke. “No. Eragon is a fantasy movie. Many things can’t be explained with science or logic. What if that dragon egg can’t hatch? We’ll follow how the movie showed it, and let that egg hatch. We only need to appear when that young dragon matures. We won’t discuss this for the time being. Have you all already confirmed if technological weapons work?\\n\\n Zero nodded and hadn’t spoken when Xuan at the side actually took the initiative to speak. “That’s right, technological weapons work. Want me to test the application of the Magic Cannon for you?”\\n\\n “... No need…”\\n\\n Zheng and the surrounding people were all breaking out in cold sweat. Xuan ignored them, and only minded his own business, taking out a set of documents and silently looking through it. Although he was looking silently, the emotions in his eyes became more fanatical with the documents being taken out. Xuan in this condition was too strange, such that Zero, who had originally standing close to him subconsciously distanced himself several metres away.\\n\\n “Although I don’t want to admit it, don’t you think Xuan in this condition is very horrifying? Supposedly he’s researching Cultivation techniques, and plans to let me cultivate these techniques to safely use Chaos, Genesis Splitter… It’s just, can his expression not keep it’s indifference? Looking at this fanatical him, I don’t know why but I feel very apprehensive…”\\n\\n Zheng looked as Xuan walked further and further away, and spoke softly to the remaining people. Everyone else had an expression of complete agreement. It looked like it wasn’t only Zheng feeling apprehensive in his heart. Facing Xuan’s fanatic expression, it was only right that everyone else felt similarly apprehensive.\\n\\n (It’s not just expression… Although Xuan didn’t overcome the heart’s devil in Independence Day, but that cannon blast still benefited him a lot. At least from his current behaviour, he was only one step from possessing emotions. I hope he gets it all before the final battle, or else…)\\n\\n Zheng hiddenly sighed. The final battle. These three words were like a mountain weighing upon his heart… Although he had said it in a way pleasing to the ears, Zheng also knew the meaning of the final battle for team China. It represented that at least half of team China would die in battle. It would be a true death. They couldn’t revive again, having already been revived once. This was also the best possibility. The other greatest possibility was… team China could very likely be wiped!\\n\\n (I hope Xuan can obtain feelings and senses before the final battle. I hope Yingkong can end her grudge with Zhao Zhuikong. I hope Heng can obtain Ming Yanwei’s forgiveness. I hope Lan… i hope we can all live on, and go back to the real world, and fulfill our dreams alive…)\\n\\n Of course, reality was always more cruel than imagination. Although Zheng continuously thought about leading everyone to live on, but when a certain someone knew about his thoughts, he could always dampen his enthusiasm.\\n\\n “... Er, you want to lead everyone to live on? Talk AFTER you’ve woken up those sleeping.”\\n\\n Hearing that Zheng wanted to lead everyone to live on, Xuan didn’t even lift his head up. While fanatically pouring over those documents, he pointed at the several members lying behind him, who were the sleeping Lan and the rest.\\n\\n Zheng immediately no longer had any momentum. He opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but didn’t in the end. Seeing this expression, Honglu sighed and interjected. “Zheng, don’t overly obsess over whether we’ll still be alive… Although living is important, some things are more important. The final battle cannot be avoided. It’s not your fault, nor is it your fault for being too weak. This is the fate decided by God. Although it’s cruel, we’re all already mentally prepared, and have the awareness of dying in the final battle.”\\n\\n Everyone else silently nodded. Even Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun nodded nonstop. Zheng breathed in deeply and turned around, and only murmured then, “Being alongside all of you… is the greatest honour in my lifetime!”\\n\\n As the words fell, everyone suddenly heard that unique voice of God. New information appeared on the watch that had not had any words on it since entering the movie.\\n\\n “Breach the capital of Alagaesia within three days! Massacre all living things within the capital! Every member will gain 3000 points upon completing the mission within three days. 1000 points will be deducted for every day the mission is not complete after the three days. If the mission is not complete within thirty days, the team will be wiped!”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-21-chapter-3-1","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
