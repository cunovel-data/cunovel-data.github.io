{"id":58372,"no":651,"title":"Vol 20 Chapter 13-1","content":"The actual aliens did not have much screen time in the original movie. They were mostly in spaceships and the Destroyers in the battles and their ground forces were few. However, the aliens in this movie had air dominance and the spider like machines on the ground, which were better fitting to the name of Harvesters, a race that drove other species to extinction.\n Zheng unleashed his attacks the instant the spaceship landed. He worried the space outside was a vacuum but since Xuan had left the spaceship already, the environment should be suitable for survival. Indeed, he stepped into an environment with air, although this air smell absolutely foul. It was still breathable and could keep them alive.\n The spaceship stopped on top of a spacious platform lined with numerous spider machines on the sides. The aliens inside the machines obviously didn\u0027t react to Zheng\u0027s appearance for a second, allowing him to dash in front of a machine with Soru before the rest of them raised their guns. Zheng sliced through the five-meter-tall spider machine with his crimson sword. The machine collapsed into metal pieces and the pieces exploded in the next second. The fire from the explosion spread out to a ten-meter area then gradually died down. A one meter deep and three-meter-wide hole was left in the center of the explosion.\n (It seems like every machine carries a large energy reserve and will explode when you destroy them. That\u0027s what enabled even regular machines to possess energy barriers. That attack took forty percent of my power to break through the barrier. Destroying a hundred of them would expend over half my refined Qi.)\n Zheng had been attempting to master control over Tiger\u0027s Soul through Magic since the last battle at the Cultivators\u0027 inheritance site. It could grant Tiger\u0027s Soul an absurd level of power but with great power came increased burden. Zheng could at most swing the sword five times in his Dragon Transformation before his whole arm would fall apart and his Magic would backfire within. So, he still used refined Qi in normal situations. He was able to use refined Qi much like how he used Qi and Blood Energy despite the lack of Cultivation techniques to utilize it.\n The spider machines were harder than Zheng imagined. Tiger\u0027s Soul was extremely sharp when powered by refined Qi but it still took Zheng forty percent of his strength to destroy one. Any other normal object would have been pulverized upon contact with the sword. Forty percent strength might not sound like a lot but hundreds of attacks at this level would empty his refined Qi.\n Zheng had to give up his plan of causing a big ruckus. He destroyed several machines then lifted a red one, which was the biggest spider machine on the platform. He activated Destruction and threw the machine into the crowd. There were so many of them on the platform and they were standing too close together. The throw knocked away dozens of machines. Zheng took this opportunity to dash off the platform.\n At the same time, a sandstorm swept out from the spaceship. The energy attacks penetrated the sandstorm and hit the steel walls, causing mini explosions. The sandstorm quickly swirled away and disappeared through a turn in the passageway.\n (Imhotep\u0027s most useful in sci-fi movies like this. His existence is nearly undying. Only energy attacks that counter him can damage him. With Imhotep on the defense and Heng on offense, they are strong enough. This leaves with… team Pacific! I am waiting!)\n Zheng saw numerous transparent tube passageways after he leaped off the platform. Inside the tubes were small vessels two to three meters in length floating half a meter above the floor. These vessels were probably the normal transportation tools of the aliens. Rays of energy shots chased after Zheng as the spider machines clustered the rim of the platform. Only those standing on the outer layer could fire. These machines weren\u0027t able to fly. Zheng blocked several shots while he dashed on top of a tube. The crimson sword sliced through it and he dropped inside in the next second.\n (Xuan has the laptop but you can\u0027t even tell if he\u0027s dead or alive after he disappeared. The dude\u0027s obnoxious. Whatever, I will walk around and find a place for the battle against team Pacific. Maybe see if I can find the rest of team Pacific left in the mothership.)\n Zheng decided on a direction and charged ahead. He swung the sword on his way, causing a series of explosions and driving the area into chaos.\n At the top layer of the atmosphere in the Earth, another spaceship was flying toward the alien mothership. This spaceship belonged to team Pacific. They defeated and abducted team China\u0027s second group then drove the spaceship after team China\u0027s spaceship.\n (It\u0027s strange. I keep feeling that I missed a detail. What is it?) Julian sat on the floor with his eyes closed. He was tapping his forehead with his finger. There was no evidence but a feeling of unease lingered inside him. It felt as though he overlooked something but when he recalled his memories, everything seemed as they should have been. There was nothing he didn\u0027t know. The biggest variable would be the strength of team China\u0027s leader.\n (If they are trying to delay until their leader comes to rescue them, I can only label them as stupid and don\u0027t live up to my expectation of them. God\u0027s realm contains a near infinite number of abilities. No one ability is the most powerful. Each ability has its use and damage. Their safety will hinder Zheng Zha\u0027s strength and he won\u0027t be able to exert his full power. Even if he does, can he defeat the three of us? He\u0027s not the same person that\u0027s in team Devil. The win rate is seventy percent… our win rate.)\n Julian turned his head toward Lionheart. His special senses allowed him to see without his eyes. This man was smiling as he looked at team China\u0027s members. He appeared gentle but that was only his attitude toward the weak. The gentleness was his pride and contempt toward the weak.\n Julian shook his head. His lips curled in a seemingly smile then it faded away. He fell back into his thoughts.\n (I have to admit this guy is an idiot. He calls himself royal blood and should have the chance to be the main character of a story with a name like that… Still, his strength is decent. The undying attribute lets him live even when he encounters people stronger than him. With the addition of my psyche force abilities and the Avalon he has, we might not lose against that man in team Devil.)\n Time slowly passed while Julian was deep in his thoughts. The spaceship approached the alien mothership and entered a gap just like team China\u0027s spaceship did. It soon landed on a platform.\n \"What\u0027s the situation outside?\" Lionheart turned to ask Julian.\n Julian\u0027s psyche force extended outward and printed the environment in his mind. He smiled. \"Surrounded by spider machines. Looks like our conjecture is correct. The aliens will attack us once the time is up. Fortunately, we found a spaceship to leave the mothership. What are we going to do now, leader?\" His lips twitched when he called Lionheart leader.\n Lionheart ran his fingers through his hair then glanced over at Anck-Su-Namun. \"Your psyche force abilities are effective against the aliens. Hypnotize them. We are not bothering wasting energy on minions. Then we will find team China\u0027s leader and kill him! Haha.\"\n Julian\u0027s mouth moved as though he was uttering \"how could it be so simple\". His eyes opened a slim gap for just an instant. Everyone in this area felt that they saw numerous Buddhas and Dharmachakra appeared. The images lasted for only an instant and the area returned normal.\n \"Done. Twenty percent power of The Treasures of Heavens. What about these people?\" Julian breathed out then asked.\n Lionheart glanced at Anck-Su-Namun again who glared at him with expressionless face. He shook his head and said. \"Hypnotize them. Team China doesn\u0027t have a psyche force user so just hypnotize them. We will take care of them after we kill their leader… And do we still have two slots to take in people from other teams?\"\n \"Uh. We do.\" Julian nodded. He turned to look at HongLu and thought for a second. \"Leave that question for later and finish this movie first. We don\u0027t have to fight team China\u0027s leader as soon as we find him. We can choose a spot beneficial to us. I can also control the aliens to aid us. Let\u0027s go.\"\n Lionheart glanced over at Anck-Su-Namun again before turning around and walking out the spaceship in a laughter. The hundreds of spider machines outside had collapsed and the aliens inside them knocked out, all due to Julian\u0027s ability.\n A few moments later, Julian and the Caucasian also came out from the spaceship. Julian nodded. \"They are all hypnotized aside from the person controlling the bombs. Not that it\u0027s meaningful to hypnotize them anyway. We are in the alien mothership and the spaceship has been set to my psyche force\u0027s frequency. There\u0027s no way for them to return to the Earth. Once we kill Zheng Zha, they won\u0027t be able to run or hide without a psyche force user… Leader. If you want women, you can create them at any time. Why must you insist on that one? We only have two slots left.\"\n Lionheart blushed then said in a fury. \"Fuck. You wanted this guy with the sheath that does nothing but protect you from attacks. I only want a slot and you are complaining. It\u0027s decided. Who\u0027s the leader here?\"\n Julian clenched his teeth then said with a smile. \"Fine. We do as you said. It\u0027s just a slot. It\u0027s fine, you are the leader.\"\n (Leader? A leader who doesn\u0027t listen. Is it time to change to another one?) Julian shrugged. He extended his psyche force outward. It split into countless thin strings in this huge mothership and spread like tentacles. In under a minute, he detected movement from very far away. There were explosions, and numerous spider machines swarming at the same direction.\n Julian\u0027s lips twitched then he said. \"Zheng Zha is over there. Be prepared for the fight… leader.\"\n He took the lead and ran toward the direction of explosions.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-20-chapter-13-01","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
