{"id":58384,"no":663,"title":"Vol 21 Chapter 1-1","content":"A feeling akin to that of being simultaneously dreaming and awake. When everyone opened their eyes, what was before them was no longer the world of steel and iron that was the alien headquarters. It was God’s Realm. Dark and bright, illusionary and real, an infinitely large world that was indescribable. Everyone was momentarily dazed in the instant they opened their eyes. It was only about a second later that Zheng abruptly shouted.\\n\\n “Damn it, Xuan you idiot! Wasn’t that too vicious? God, full body repair! Deduct the points from me!”\\n\\n Although Zheng was shouting, he was still calling for a full body repair with a clear mind. Although his injuries had already fully recovered after fusing with the Guide, the other team members were more or less injured. Especially was Heng’s group, whose breath had become extremely weak. He didn’t know what the so called energy absorption Lionheart used was. Could it turn people into servants like the vampires in legends? Thus, the usual full body repair was a necessity.\\n\\n Just as he had imagined, the time Heng and the others, who had been drained dry of energy, spent suspended in the air had even exceeded the time spent to repair their genes after unlocking the genetic constraint. Only after a long time did they fall down from mid-air. When they reached the ground, Anck-Su-Namun cried as she pounced on Imhotep. The handsome bald man was actually at a slight loss at this. After all, Anck-Su-Namun in the past was an icy beauty, so this type of situation occurring were too few.\\n\\n Wang Xia, Cheng Xiao and Heng all understandingly smiled at this. Heng immediately looked at Ming Yanwei subconsciously. However, she simply didn\u0027t even look at him, and seemed completely indifferent. This action made Heng’s heart feel cold, and he bitterly laughed. He looked silently at the rest of his comrades. Of course… he didn’t know about her expression before at the alien headquarters...\\n\\n At this moment, on the other side among the team members, Zheng was holding Xuan by the collar. The furious man raised his hand and was about to hit Xuan. Unexpectedly, an ancient bell sounded suddenly. A small brass bell appeared on Xuan’s head. Zheng, who was originally about to hit Xuan, fell to the ground. His entire body spasmed continuously, as if he was suffering some great pain.\\n\\n “Does it hurt?” Xuan held the small brass bell in his palm, quietly asking Zheng.\\n\\n Zheng shouted as he spasmed on the ground. “Damn it, what toy is that! Why does it hurt so much? I can’t possibly not even be able to endure pain with my body constitution right? What did you do, Doraemon? Could that small bell be…”\\n\\n “Hmm… yes. It is indeed the Bell of the East Emperor… But why is it so different? This fluctuation can directly stimulate the sense of pain. Even you are in so much pain. So, why can I still not feel?”\\n\\n Xuan looked at his palm, then shut his eyes for a very long time. After he had opened his eyes, the surrounding people had already encircled him, including Zheng who had fallen on the ground after being attacked with pain. Compared to anything else, what everyone cared about the most was whether Xuan had overcome his heart’s devil.\\n\\n Xuan indifferently shook his head. “I didn’t overcome the heart’s devil, but I did suppress it. It seems I still need to…”\\n\\n Hearing that, all the surrounding people felt their entire body shiver, as if Xuan was about to attack them next. Also, what was most terrifying weren’t his attacks, but his endless schemes that were hard to guard against. They didn’t want to go through it again… They really didn’t want to go through the feeling of being schemed by their head strategist, especially this man Chu Xuan.\\n\\n “...I’ll have to switch to another method.”\\n\\n Xuan was shaking his head. “I originally thought that the heart’s devil could be overcome by using this type of forceful method to breakthrough. It wasn’t easy to find a chance to scheme against God, which was why I had to borrow this chance to finish this matter. Who would have expected that I could only suppress it like before? Although the suppression is very thorough, and I wouldn’t be afraid of it flaring up when I use the power of an early fourth stage… There isn’t much difference between this and using the Lambda Driver to suppress it apart from the probability decreasing,. So, I still need another method to overcome it.”\\n\\n As Xuan was talking, Zheng suddenly hit the back of his head, causing this utterly cold man to stagger. Zheng directly grabbed his collar and spoke. “Damn it, was I farting before? I said that whenever there’s something going on, say something! Just say something? Will you die if you say something? Did you think I would disagree with your scheme and plan?”\\n\\n Xuan didn’t mind Zheng’s actions. He pushed up his spectacles as he spoke. “If you knew about it beforehand… would you have agreed to my scheme and plans this time?”\\n\\n “Of course I won’t agree!”\\n\\n It was almost unimaginable… Zheng’s answer just happened to be resolute and unhesitating. To the surrounding people, the result of them conversing was exactly the same as not speaking.\\n\\n Xuan seemed to know Zheng would answer thus. He only placed that small ancient bell on the ground, before speaking. “After I found out you no longer possess the leader status, I have been waiting for this opportunity… My heart’s devil probably appeared in the Transformers movie. At that time, I knew I was nearing the mid fourth stage. Although I don’t know why, I had a feeling that if I broke through this obstacle, I would obtain what I’ve always wanted…”\\n\\n “Based on information obtained in the past, God will create a new Guide to enter the team when the team leader dies. The team members will then be tested in a certain horror movie. When the team leader is determined, the entire horror movie will be stopped…”\\n\\n “Wait.” Honglu suddenly interjected. “How could you be sure that the movie would be stopped when the ascertained team leader was in danger? Or if the movie was stopped as soon as the team leader was determined, wouldn’t your heart\u0027s devil plan be unusable? To be honest, I only have a confidence of about sixty percent. How are you so sure?”\\n\\n “Mhm…” Xuan indifferently took a tomato from his chest area and took a bite. “I’ve never been sure…”\\n\\n (That’s right. I nearly forgot about this fellow’s deep rooted bad habit. He will dare to bet on anything as long as the probability exceeds fifty percent. Although he hasn’t lost any so far… He’s really a gambler through and through!)\\n\\n Everyone shivered in aversion within their hearts, while Xuan continued to speak as he ate his tomato. “The basic situation is like that. Based on all the information collated, there are two possibilities after the Guide has determined the team leader. First is that the team safely completes the movie world. The second is that the team doesn’t finish the movie world safely. Ignoring how the first scenario would go for now, if we use Jie’s example to analyse it, we can at least confirm that for the second scenario, the Guide will likely stop the whole movie world when the team meets great danger. That was why Jie would say what he did at that time. Even though the situation then made him feel safe, and he still died after that, that should have nothing to do with the environment. It should instead have to do with the special circumstances he met. Thus, I have reason to believe that the Guide stopped the movie since Jie had already been determined as the leader, and was the only one left to die. In other words, the Guide would only stop the entire movie world when the team leader meets danger!”\\n\\n “If you think along this direction, the plan to use force to overcome the heart’s devil could be realised. Since the goal of the plan was to kill everyone, to do it after the Guide had ascertained the leader, and to also have the leader be one of the dead, there was only one place I could think of to scheme with these preconditions. That was the horror movie world where the new leader is selected…”\\n\\n Everyone silently listened to Xuan’s words. When he finally finished his speech, Cheng Xiao curiously asked a question. “Er, I won’t get into the intricacies of the scheme for now. We have the weirdo you, and the little weirdo Honglu for that after all... What I want to ask is, how did you distinguish who the Guide is between the two newbies? I could tell that Honglu and you were very confident.”\\n\\n Honglu coughed lightly, and held the hair in front of his forehead as he laughed. “Let me answer that question… As a Guide, even if it’s a half Guide, half team member like Zhang Jie, there is one thing to always take note of. Even if it’s Jie who breaks it, God will also raise the difficulty of the movie. That is that no matter what, they cannot interfere with the progress of the movie. This means they cannot meddle in the changes to the movie or the survival of team members and cannot attack members of other teams… Only Yang Xuelin among the two newbies had never done these from the start. Lin Juntian however, wanted to change the progress of the movie from the start. So, the Guide was instead the easiest to determine… Apart from this were the intricacies of the scheme. Ever since I discovered the situation Xuan left for me, I’ve been completely following his arrangements, and setting up this scheme…”\\n\\n “Wait just a moment.” Zheng suddenly asked a question. “That just now was… the Bell of the East Emperor right? You can use this Cultivation treasure?”\\n\\n “Impossible.” Xuan replied extremely directly. “Remember what I told you before? The Bell of the East Emperor’s initial usages can be obtained directly. However, it requires large amounts of energy to sustain. My Lambda Driver can still act as the processor to control the Bell of the East Emperor. To provide this enormous energy… it can only be obtained from the alien headquarters. That’s right. Before, the Bell of the East Emperor was stealing the energy from the alien headquarters. That pain stimulation just now was the last of the energy. Wait until you get ten thousand times stronger before you use this… if you want to use the Bell of the East Emperor, it’s still too early for the current you. Before all that, why not tell me…”\\n\\n “The specific data regarding Chaos, Genesis Splitter.”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-21-chapter-1-1","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
