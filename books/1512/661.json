{"id":58382,"no":661,"title":"Vol 20 Chapter 16-2","content":"Lionheart was in a good mood. Especially when he had absorbed two people’s energies, this happiness had peaked. It also happened that his Vampire genes had advanced in level at the same time. The strongest the Vampire bloodline could get to was the Prince rank. These Vampires also still weren’t strengthened to the limit yet. They needed to continuously become stronger to complete these genes. But when they reached this stage of evolved genes, they would possess an innate enhancement, which was to absorb energy and genes of others to reach perfection. This was the true meaning of the ‘Bloodkin’. Although Lionheart had an extremely strong body constitution, his team battle experience was still pitiful as team Pacific was the type of team which enslaved their team like cattle. He thus didn’t have much chance to absorb the genes and power of powerful combatants, making it such that this seemingly strong ability really didn’t end up being of much use. Honestly speaking, team China’s main combatants actually possessed great strength. Whether it was body constitution or the level of their genetic constraint, it was something other teams had difficulty matching. Most likely only the two teams of team Celestial and team Devil could compare. Thus Lionheart casually absorbing the energies of a few people was already enough for a large increase of his power. There was also Heng, the strong combatant that few in team China were equal to. Finally, his Vampire genes began to undergo an evolution. “How pleasurable. Is this the feeling of the evolution of genes? It’s as if everything is being trampled under my feet…” Lionheart roared towards the skies. That pair of wings on his back aggressively extended, and the blood coloured rune words that adorned his wings looked extremely mysterious and unfathomable. At the same time a dark crimson flame appeared on that man’s body, and the scintillating light made him seem like a devil out of hell, powerful to the point of being undefeatable. “Perfect! If I continue to strengthen like this, I perhaps may truly be able to become a god or devil! Haha, this rate of evolution is truly unimaginable. Team China… excellent. These are the stepping stones that have appeared for me to become a god. Team China, haha, what a beautiful term. I’m simply too happy! Not a single one of you shall escape!” Lionheart madly cried out, and he seemed to have once again sunk into a state of insanity. He raised his hand as he shouted, and a cloud of dust rose outwards, and those lying on the ground were all pushed ten metres away. That power was extremely great, and it was difficult to imagine this person possessed this power. Lionheart froze. He exaggeratedly looked at his hands, then began to laugh. “Too powerful. The power after undergoing this evolution is truly too great. I want to destroy or kill someone. If I use this power to face your team leader, that Zheng Zha that looks to be so strong? Who do you say will win? Hahaha…” As he spoke, he suddenly raised his hand, and Heng who was lying far away from him suddenly floated up, before floating towards him. When Heng landed in his hands, he suddenly frowned. He lifted Heng up for a long time, before viciously throwing him onto the ground. “Useless. The energy has already all been drained dry… I’ll just kill the whole lot of you, then wait for the remaining members of team China to come. Perhaps I should leave some of you alive… Haha, I know you all surely must be unsatisfied in your hearts, but what can you do? This is a world where the strong devour the weak after all…” A clump of dark crimson flame appeared in Lionheart’s hand. In a moment it would slowly float towards Heng, who was lying down on the ground. With the power it had, this fireball would definitely burn Heng to ashes with ease. As for whether the Heng now had enough strength to resist this flame, he didn’t even have the strength to turn over his body. He could only lie prone on the ground gasping nonstop, and allow that flame to near him. At this moment, far off in the passageway, Honglu and the rest were doing their all to rush over here. The petite shadow in the lead that was swiftly charging over was Zhao Yingkong. She was even carrying Excalibur already. It was only that they were simply too far from Lionheart. Even with Yingkong’s speed she wouldn’t be able to stop that flame from flying towards Heng. With the great distance apart, there wasn’t enough time even if Zero took out his Gauss sniper rifle immediately... “Heng!” The far off Ming Yanwei cried out pitifully. As she had run too anxiously, she fell onto the ground. Her delicate lips also hit the ground. When she raised her head again, the distant Lionheart was laughing maniacally again, and that flame was already less than half a metre from Heng. Then... BOOM! Suddenly, a giant shadow fell down from above Lionheart’s head. This giant shadow was in fact the ceiling above crashing down. Within the blink of an eye, Lionheart, who had greatly strengthened his body, jumped away with a single step. And Heng, who had been left there, was about to be crushed by that ceiling, only for another black shadow to land on the ground first with an inconceivable speed. The shadow picked up Heng. Then, the ceiling crushed the shadow’s head under it... It was another violent booming sound. The ceiling was actually rend apart with the shadow at the centre. And only now, did everyone see the identity of the black shadow. It was Zheng, who had rushed over frenziedly with Julian in hand. With such a far distance in between them, he had inconceivably rushed over at a speed that surpassed the Sky Stick by far. Lionheart’s performance was worthy of praise. He elegantly floated far away, then snapped his fingers. “Rushed over? Want to save your teammates? What a pity, I’ve already drained their energy. Even if it’s you, for the me who has absorbed this energy…” Before Lionheart had even finished speaking, a stream of psyche force entered his mind. This stream of psyche force was extremely hasty and sudden, and only contained a single word. “FLEE!’ “Eh?” In the next moment, Lionheart’s head had already collapsed into pieces, and his remains was sent flying over a hundred metres by an enormous force. It violently slammed in a metal wall, and the metal wall actually caved in with him as the centre. The surrounding hundred metres of the metal wall became a giant hole, with Lionheart’s remains as the centre. This situation was too terrifying. Zheng had simply stood there unmoving, and no one had seen him do anything. Not even Zhao Yingkong that had been closely looking there could. Everyone came to a stop. They all dully looked on at all this. At the same time, Zheng’s skin suddenly tore open, and fresh flood began to flow out continuously. This state was just like how it if he overused Destruction when his body was still weak in the past. It was only that Destruction couldn’t cause this scene, or damage his body, that had undergone the Dragon Transformation, to this extent. “That was… Chaos! Genesis Splitter… Still not dead yet? You can survive even without a head?” Zheng inhaled a breath, before lightly jumping up. His entire body was in midair, and all that could be seen was a single leg kicking backwards. It was a speed that the naked eye had trouble following, but the power of this kick had torn apart the air. Ripples in the air visible to the naked eye struck the wall behind. This leg had merely kicked backwards through the air, and the wall sunk in with the ripple as the centre. It even produced ruptures and explosions. This kick possessed unimaginable power, and borrowing the force of this mid air kick, Zheng shot like a cannonball towards Lionheart, who was buried in the wall. Within an instant, violent tremors and explosions were let off. With just the inconceivably powerful kick, more destruction was actually caused than tactical nukes. After the kick, that entire wall had disappeared, and all that was left was a deep hole that was difficult to see through, directly connecting to a distant passageway... “Too, too terrifying…” Liu Yu was stupefied seeing this as he murmured. The rest were similarly stupefied. Only Honglu shouted, flustered. “Zero! Kill the person Zheng brought! You must kill him! It doesn\u0027t matter even if you use your Mystic Eyes!” Zero froze when he heard that. He didn’t reply, and only silently raised the Gauss sniper rifle. Honglu had already started to talk to himself. “If Explosion can be said to be the superficial energy collision of qi and blood energy, Destruction is to to turn it all into destructive power. Zheng definitely mixed those two energies together… Damn it, Xuan! You have to quickly fire off the cannon, or else it’ll all be too late!” At this moment, Zero’s Gauss sniper rifle had already sounded. Before the sound of the gun firing erupted, the white light around the distant Julian had already flashed suddenly. Only when the sound of the gun rang out, did Julian abruptly turn around, and his eyes opened once again! “You dare!” A noise suddenly rang out from that hole. Zheng was standing silently in midair. The wings on his back flapped as if nothing had happened. It was only that his entire body was covered in fresh blood, and looked extremely wretched. However, no one at this time felt as if he looked wretched. Instead… for all of those who had seen clone Zheng before, they only felt as if they were seeing that man. “There’s no such thing as dare or don\u0027t dare. I know this power of yours definitely can’t be maintained for long. You would have become a god long ago otherwise. So you will definitely kill me before you weaken. If I must die, I will drag someone down with me no matter what!” Julian had a hideous expression as he howled. His eyes were already wide open, and he was already planning to use the Arayashiki on team China. Zheng inhaled a deep breath. A strong gale rushed past, and he had already appeared next to Julian in the next instant. His leg was already kicking towards Julian’s head. Within less than a second, Julian would definitely die. At this time, an ancient bell suddenly rang out. Without knowing why, Zheng’s powerful kick actually paused in mid-air. Then, a powerful energy beam of light from far off bombarded them, and everyone was enveloped inside...
