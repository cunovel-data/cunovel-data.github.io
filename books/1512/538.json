It was not due to fear but the person whom this voice came from. “Is that… you?” Lan’s voice was shaking. She couldn’t move a finger as the warmth approached her from behind. She didn’t even use Psyche Scan. This voice alone nearly crippled her. “It’s me and not me. Freddy’s power allows me to appear for a short moment. The only thing I can do… is hold you again.” A figure embraced Lan from behind and the warmth enveloped this crying woman. It was a warmth that had nearly faded from her memories but deep down in her soul, she had never forgotten this feeling. Lan basked in this feeling quietly. Tears continued rolling down her cheeks. She knew he had died long ago. She knew he couldn’t be here even if he were still alive. This was an illusion, an illusion created by Freddy. But this feeling was so real. She wanted to relive this experience again, even if this was merely an illusion. The words that came from the figure was nothing gentle like the embrace. “You betrayed me, didn’t you? You fell in love with someone else, didn’t you? You are not the woman waiting to marry me anymore… you betrayed me!” Lan cried. She felt her heart cracking. It was as though something very important within her shattered. She clenched her teeth then said. “Please no… Freddy. Please. Kill me… don’t toy with my heart!” The figure’s words remained ugly. “You… are not a virgin anymore, aren’t you? You have been soiled. Hahaha.” The figure spread out and enclosed Lan in her entirety. The two disappeared, like Lan had never been here. The rest of the team were running toward the toilet. They heard a loud bang similar to the sound of a wall breaking from an impact. They looked at each other then hurried their steps. YinKong jumped out the window to take the shortcut. The others followed her. WangXia was running at the front so he didn’t see the others taking the shortcut. By the time he looked around, he had already arrived at the toilet. He placed his hand on the doorknob, pushed the door open, and rushed in. The door closed behind him. Behind the door was not the toilet. It was an old and slightly weathered house. WangXia stared around the house with a bit of uncertainty. Then he spread his arms and activated this demon energy. “Freddy! So you’ve come for me!” WangXia shouted. “Come! I will not fear you! I don’t know how you replicated my old home but did you think a simple house could break apart my will? Did you think my heart will waver? Come! Come and face me if you dare!” WangXia channeled his demon energy onto the plasma grenades by his waist. He would attack at the instant Freddy appeared close. No one, not even Zheng could escape from this attack without damage at such close distance. An old man’s voice came through the door. “Is it my nephew, WangXia? Have you returned?” WangXia became silent. He recognized this voice very well. The man was a distant relative in the village who looked after his family since he was a child. Before he replied, an old man carrying a walking stick walked into the house. Tears began to roll down the old man’s face as he hit WangXia with the walking stick. WangXia hesitated even though knew he couldn’t let down his guard once Freddy caught him. The gap in his heart was the thinnest compared to the rest of the team. He entered the world through hypnosis so he was confident on taking Freddy. However, when a elder he knew appeared, he didn’t know how to react. The beating from the walking stick wasn’t anything painful fortunately so he just let it go on. The old man spoke as he wept. “You unfilial child! Your mother raised you and watched you go off with silver hair. Yet, no one was there when she died. How could she give birth to such an unfilial child. I am going to beat you on behalf of your mother…” WangXia grabbed onto the walking stick and shouted. “Mother… Wasn’t she healthy when I left? The army said they would look after her. How in such a short period of time? How did she pass away? That’s impossible. Right. You’re Freddy! This is all just a dream!” WangXia was going to throw the grenade at the weeping old man. Yet, he couldn’t do it despite knowing this was merely a dream. He was wrong. His mother was the weakness that he had in his heart. That woman with silver hair. The old man pointed the stick at the ancestor altars behind WangXia. That was when he noticed his mother’s name. He was the only person left in this family. Redness overtook WangXia’s eyes. He dropped to his knees and knocked his head against the floor repeatedly. Blood stained the floor. WangXia finally broke down and cried. He couldn’t contain the tears of a man. Something approached him from behind. Not the old man’s walking stick but a scissor like glove. It grasped WangXia by the neck… Zheng leaped up abruptly and looked around. The scene was peaceful. He didn’t notice anything abnormal. Several members were standing next to him, looking worried. “You alright? You fell asleep last night. Fortunately, Xuan found out and took over the night watch. We would have been in danger otherwise.” ChengXiao asked him. Zheng was stunned for a moment before he yelled. “Shit. I fell into a dream again? How? Why did I fall asleep as soon as I went near Freddy? Fuck it! How are we supposed to kill him?” The rest of the team looked confused. Kampa patted Zheng on the shoulder and said, “Don’t worry. It was safe last night. The seven of us have been in the house the whole night.” “Seven?” There was no time to feel angry. Zheng quickly searched around. He had confirmed the death of the two newbies. But Zero, Lan, and WangXia were also missing. They disappeared as though they never existed. The team had forgotten about them. Zheng pushed Kampa to the side and ran over to the table. He picked up the piece of paper that recorded their names. All he could feel was ice cold. There were only seven names. He wrote down fourteen names but there were only seven names. Seven disappeared. Even the words that he wrote down disappeared! The rest of the team heard Zheng mumbling, “Zero, Lan, WangXia, Heng, HongLu. We can forget about the newbies but the five of them fought alongside us! How can I ever forget them? How can I? Freddy… I am going to kill you!” A wave of killing intent surged from Zheng. He almost couldn’t contain himself from picking up Tiger’s Soul and killing stuff. He could take on anything in a direct fight. All these movies he had been to didn’t take him down. However, the helplessness, the disappearances one by one, and the possibility of forgetting his comrades struck him. How could he forget those who had fought with him, who had traveled to hell and made it back together? “There’s definitely a solution to this movie. There must be!” Zheng clenched his teeth and roared. “God wouldn’t give a movie without a solution! There has to be a solution to this movie! Xuan… help me!” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-18-chapter-9-01","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
