{"id":58368,"no":647,"title":"Vol 20 Chapter 11-2","content":"Zheng was strong both physically and mentally after surviving countless life and death battles, enduring through the deaths of many comrades, and overcoming his heart\u0027s devil. He had nearly patched up his flaws in every aspect. He wasn\u0027t strong enough to completely disregard other teams yet, but he could be crowned as non-human by the other teams.\\n\\n Still, Zheng wasn\u0027t omnipotent.\\n\\n A hero alone could not carry a team through God\u0027s realm. Individual heroism usually equated to idiocy in the realm and could only get by against ordinary teams. Any team with a decent strategist on the level of Neos, or perhaps even Julian could kill this heroism along with the person\u0027s team. The only exception was when this team\u0027s strength achieved a limit where wit no longer had any effect on it, just like the current team Devil.\\n\\n A team, as it suggested, required talents from multiple fields. The strategist, the psyche force user, close and long-range combatants, researchers, medics, etc… A complete team required the cooperation of too many people. Team China was a rare case where they had a variety of talents, including the researcher who tended to have the least self-sustain. Furthermore, their researcher was also a strategist with unfathomable strength. A lot of times, he gave off a sense of being stronger than Zheng.\\n\\n Zheng looked at the comrades standing beside him. These were the people who had fought along him on the edge of hell. They were all strong. They were his pride and weakness. His comrades were like his life and he whole heartedly believed in them.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s decided then. Xuan, Heng, Imhotep, XueLin and I will ride the spaceship to the alien mothership. HongLu will command the rest of you. Zero, WangXia, and YinKong are strong fighters. If the other team finds you while I am away, please protect everyone.\" Zheng said to his team while the American military staffs were cleaning up the spaceship in the distance.\\n\\n Everyone who first saw the spaceship rushed near it for a closer look. However, a stench that came from the spaceship nearly fainted them. The smell originated from the bio-suit the aliens wore. It was unbearable to humans and seemed to be slightly toxic. Team China had no choice but to wait for the spaceship to be cleaned before they could board it. During this time, Zheng reminded the team of things to look out for and how to deal with assaults from team Pacific. Things were easier said than done. One mistake by the team and they would be taken out one by one by team Pacific.\\n\\n (We also split up when we fought team Devil and the outcome was… I am scared that this battle will be another collapse of the team. Sigh. This bad feeling has been lingering on my mind. Am I overthinking it?)\\n\\n Zheng gave a good look at Xuan and HongLu. The two people\u0027s images gradually overlapped. There were still many differences between the two, but they seemed to have the same devil\u0027s tail on their backs. They were equally obnoxious when it came to hiding information. Zheng wondered if it was a habit for all smart people to do things that no one understood.\\n\\n \"I know you are hiding something from me, HongLu. I can\u0027t see through this mist but it probably has to do with team Pacific. Maybe even the heart\u0027s devil of Xuan. I don\u0027t know what scheme you have in plan. One thing I know is you are a member of team China. You won\u0027t forego the interest of the team. I have always believed that. You were right that we believe in Xuan too much and have forgotten that he has his own issues. This movie could be the turning point of our perception. You are also team China\u0027s strategist. You are also strong!\" Zheng stood in front of HongLu with his back to him and said.\\n\\n (Everyone is growing. He hasn\u0027t figured out what I have been doing but he can guess the crucial points. Keep growing. If one day, Xuan and I and most of the team are gone, you can still climb to the top.)\\n\\n HongLu exhaled and laughed. \"Of course, everything I do is with the team in mind. It\u0027s too early to claim this since we can still fail, but believe in me. I might not be at Xuan\u0027s height but I won\u0027t disappoint you.\"\\n\\n Zheng nodded and didn\u0027t say anything after. The team watched the staffs clean up the spaceship.\\n\\n As the cleaning came to an end, Zheng took out ten pieces of silver plates from his ring. \"This are the things we used in The Mummy. They should work anywhere within the atmosphere. However, Xuan said their effectiveness will reduce once you leave the atmosphere due to magnetic fields. I don\u0027t know if we will be able to keep in contact after the boarded the spaceship. So, all of you keep one in hand and use them if we get split up.\"\\n\\n Zheng reiterated the things to keep in mind almost like a parent figure. The ominous feeling lingering drove him to repeat himself again and again. Only when the cleaning was finished did he stop.\\n\\n Xuan and XueLin walked into the spaceship one after the other. Heng gave a good gaze at YanWei before walking away. He didn\u0027t say anything and she only put up a cold smile on her face. Never did he notice how fake and unnatural that smile was.\\n\\n Imhotep kissed Anck-Su-Namun until she was running out of breath like the romantic guy that he was. She was a woman attractive enough to seduce the high priest to betray the pharaoh. The two newbies couldn\u0027t put their eyes on her when she blushed and breathed heavily. Imhotep let go of her afterward then headed into the spaceship.\\n\\n \"Haha. Not like you\u0027re going to hell…\" ChengXiao patted Zheng on the shoulder. \"Leave now so you can be back sooner. We will be watching the fireworks from Earth. Make the fireworks blaze more dazzling than ever!\"\\n\\n Zheng laughed and exhaled. He followed the other four people into the spaceship.\\n\\n Team China spent quite a lot of talking to obtain the spaceship\u0027s usage instead of letting the American government seize it for research. Even after the five-people boarded the spaceship, the government staffs were still trying to persuade those who were staying behind to put a nuclear bomb in the spaceship and detonate it once the spaceship got inside the mothership.\\n\\n However, HongLu firmly denied their request. He stated that the ride was dangerous enough on its own as they were betting on the alien to act as they predicted. If the alien had a mean to detect nuclear weapons, having one on the spaceship would declare death to everyone inside. HongLu would not allow the American government to put a nuclear weapon to get rid of that possibility. The strength of these five people was powerful enough to kill their way through the mothership once they got inside.\\n\\n (It feels kind of sad that I started learning Xuan\u0027s ways. I am taking bets in my plans, betting on the aliens\u0027 actions and betting on Xuan to have control of the pace. If even one step in the plan goes wrong, the team will fall into an abyss and can never climb out.)\\n\\n The spaceship levitated and wavered in the air. After it gained stability, it rose faster and faster then shot up to the sky at an unbelievable speed in front of everyone. The spaceship disappeared beyond the clouds.\\n\\n \"Whew. They finally left.\" HongLu exhaled. His hand stealthily grasped the silver plate that Zheng left to him. While people were still staring at the sky, his voice sounded in their minds.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t look surprised or any other expression. Continue looking up and listen. I am going to fill you in the details of our plan. First thing is the battle that will come upon our group.\"\\n\\n Their expression didn\u0027t look any different but if one were to look closely, they could notice the nervousness on LiuYu, JunTian, and Anck-Su-Namun\u0027s faces. Anck-Su-Namun\u0027s eyes moving as if she were contemplating something.\\n\\n \"… That\u0027s the assignment for our group. All the unconscious members are placed in the American military base. There\u0027s risk of the alien air force attacking the group but our operation is only more dangerous in comparison. The only thing we can do is pray for the end of the movie to come sooner.\"\\n\\n HongLu paused before continuing. \"If the plan Xuan and I set up proceeds perfectly, this movie should end in twelve hours at the most. There is less than a thirty percent chance the military base gets attacked. We have to take this bet… Now, on to Xuan\u0027s part of the plan…\"\\n\\n This plan was jointly set up by Xuan and HongLu. Xuan initiated the plan and continued until his heart\u0027s devil was on the brink of emerging. Then HongLu woke up. He couldn\u0027t know the details of Xuan\u0027s plan so he had to continue with what was left to him… The end result was the final plan team China had in Independence Day.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the basic situation. Uh, this line… Anyway, that\u0027s the plan Xuan and I set up. There is a seventy percent chance team Pacific will attack us. I only have one request for YinKong. Use your current strength and not her strength. You can\u0027t use her strength until we are inside the mothership. We will be captured but the chance of them killing us immediately is almost zero because the other group will hear a notification if someone dies during a team battle. Assaulting us means that team Pacific is decently smart and confident at wiping our whole team. They are afraid of Zheng running around with the spaceship after he heard a notification, so they wouldn\u0027t be able to kill him. Once they defeat us, don\u0027t fight back with your lives. Get captured at just the right level of retaliation and our lives are safe.\"\\n\\n HongLu sighed. \"The next battle will be inside the mothership. And our plan is…\"\\n\\n It had been two minutes and the group was still staring at the sky. The Americans were getting impatient but just then, a tiny object appeared in the distance and was growing bigger and bigger. A spaceship loomed in on the people. They thought Zheng\u0027s group returned on the spaceship but when it came within three hundred meters, they realized this spaceship was at least three times bigger than a normal one. There were several barrels equipped. The armament seemed much more powerful.\\n\\n People\u0027s eyes fixed on the spaceship that slowly landed on a few hundred meters away. The American politicians and soldiers let out a sigh of relief when they saw three humans walked out. The members of team China on the other hand tensed their bodies as they stared at the three people.\\n\\n The person walking in the front was the leader of team Pacific whom Zheng met, Lionheart. He showed a bright smile as soon as he stepped out of the spaceship. He was sparkling with his shiny blond hair and handsome look. The man said. \"What are you waiting for, players of team China? Put down your weapons and surrender. I am a gentleman. There won\u0027t be tortures on captives… especially for beautiful women.\" He smiled at Anck-Su-Namun.\\n\\n Zero raised the sniper rifle without a word and no scope fired at Lionheart. A rippling wave emerged in front of Lionheart the moment a bang was heard. A visible barrier stopped the bullet. Lionheart reached out his hand and grabbed the long and narrow bullet with his hand.\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah. A Gauss sniper rifle. This thing is powerful and a great value. We had a member who used this weapon and he was cloned into team Devil for his potential. I never thought team China has so many talents, especially a sniper.\" Lionheart said with a smile.\\n\\n His eyes sharpened for a moment as he flicked his thumb. A piercing sound whistled followed by the sound of impact. Zero flew back half a meter. There was a thumb sized hole on his right shoulder when he dropped back on the ground. The bullet Lionheart flicked was powerful enough to pierce a person shoulder blade at over fifty meters away!\\n\\n (Zheng is probably the only one who can do that with pure strength. Maybe the other YinKong too.) HongLu thought.\\n\\n The other members of team China rushed at Lionheart when they saw Zero fell in blood. The man with closed eyes who were standing behind Lionheart shook his head and said. \"It\u0027s no use. Team Celestial has given us information about your team. The only people with the power to fight back are your sniper at a distance, this little girl, and your leader, who is extremely strong. However, he\u0027s not here. Give up. Do you know why we didn\u0027t attack you with the weapons on the spaceship? It has limited energy. We don\u0027t have to waste so much energy on you guys. That\u0027s reserved to catch up to your leader. Surrender.\"\\n\\n (YinKong has only just obtained that power. Team Celestial doesn\u0027t know of her strength. Zheng said Zero killed the only Cultivator in God\u0027s realm during the Lord of the Rings. They are bound to remember him. The question is why didn\u0027t team Celestial warn them of the most dangerous person? Putting Zheng aside, there\u0027s still Xuan. Adam lost in the battle of wits so he shouldn\u0027t forget that monster. Unless… team Celestial wants to get rid of team Pacific through our hands.)\\n\\n While HongLu contemplated, YinKong performed a slash motion using the invisible Excalibur. Lionheart glanced at her with contempt. When the air pressure was near him, his eyes changed expression and the sword glided across from his left shoulder, cutting him in halves. Yet, there was no blood. The two halves of his body transformed into palm size bats that swarmed beyond YinKong. They assembled into a human form and transformed back into Lionheart, unharmed.\\n\\n This was an ability once used by clone Zheng.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-20-chapter-11-02","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
