Zheng followed the curator\u0027s advice to split the gold into three portions and sold them separately to banks of England, the U.S., and France under an Egyptian civil organization. This was a rather well known organization but underneath it was the Medjai. Zheng gave them a cubic meter of gold as thanks. \"Even though we are descendants of the Pharaohs who were known for wealth, but most of our people are living on the borderline of hunger. We can\u0027t help it. This is the desert. There\u0027s no land suitable for production. I thank you on behalf of my people, my friend.\" Ardeth came with several elders in robes. The elders widened their eyes the moment they saw the gold then immediately agreed to the excavation and protect the workers and supply line. If Zheng wasn\u0027t aware of the plot knowing they were people would would die for their cause, he would have assumed they were merchants. As Ardeth explained, Zheng said. \"I understand. This is nothing to be ashamed about. Plus, there\u0027s a large quantity of gold buried in Hamunaptra. Your people\u0027s living condition will certainly change for the better once you get the gold.\" Ardeth shook his head with a bitter smile then said. \"I heard you have learned of the Scorpion King\u0027s treasure. There\u0027s a good news and a bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?\" Zheng paused. There were only two things that affected his future in this world, the Scorpion King\u0027s treasure and the excavation of Hamunaptra. Aside for these, he didn\u0027t even care if the three banks went bankrupt. He shook his head and said. \"Bro, just say it. I don\u0027t know what can be considered good or bad news for me.\" \"The good news is, our people are discussing whether you should go search for the Scorpion King\u0027s treasure. Since we can delay you for a bit but not every time. So the elders might want to eliminate the Scorpion King once and for all. We don\u0027t want the Scorpion King to revive under some scheme in the future. In contrast, if your strength can gain the elders\u0027 acknowledgement and obtain the Spear of Osiris, we will agree to the search for the treasure.\" Zheng was excited and said loudly. \"That\u0027s great. It\u0027s fortunate to gain your help!\" \"The bad news is the Spear had disappeared for over 2000 years already. The last time it appeared was during a war between the Pharaoh and invaders. The Pharaoh pierced the heart of the leader of the invaders then the spear was lost. My apologies but without the spear, the elders won\u0027t agree to you searching for the Scorpion King.\" Zheng\u0027s face looked bitter. In the plot of The Mummy Returns, the spear first appeared in Jonathan but the movie never mentioned how he obtained it. There was also no mention of where in the tomb was the bracelet. Everything seemed like an illusion. It was very likely that he couldn’t find the Scorpion King\u0027s treasure. He didn’t know how his clone completed this mission in the first Mummy movie. \"Ay, true. We don\u0027t even have the bracelet. Not to mention the Spear of Osiris. This already seem impossible.\" Zheng muttered. Ardeth laughed. \"We know the whereabouts of the bracelet. It\u0027s hidden in the tomb. Unfortunately, we lost the key to open it, the key that opens the Book of Amun-Ra and the Book of the Dead. Otherwise, we could have first obtained the bracelet. So that even if you can\u0027t find the spear, we can hide the bracelet and keep it safe.\" Zheng took out the key from his ring. \"Well, I have the key but not the spear. I don’t think you can defeat the Scorpion King with normal firearms. So let\u0027s talk about the excavation first.\" The Medjai had been wanting to excavate Hamunaptra for quite some time but they didn\u0027t have the funds to sustain the operation. They dreaded the curse of Imhotep before the first movie happened and didn\u0027t enter the tomb. However, after the first movie, it was already too late when Hamunaptra collapsed. The gold inside was also buried. When they learned of Zheng willing to excavate Hamunaptra, they were delighted and therefore became agreeable to searching for the Scorpion King. Zheng sighed at this world after learning everything from Ardeth. Money was the most power item in the world. At least more useful than he imagined. Yet, he was lacking so many things but gold. Anyway, with the help of the Medjais, he sent a telegraph to O\u0027Connell then began hiring workers using the organization\u0027s name. The pay was the best of it\u0027s kind so everything was set within a week. Three thousand workers and a thousand camels carrying tools and some machines headed toward Hamunaptra. The expenses were through the roof since this took place in a desert. Zheng traded three more cubic meters of gold and let the curator handle the money. He went to Hamunaptra with Ardeth. Ardeth looked at the crowd in front and said. \"You are overemphasizing. Our people are experienced in this kind of excavations. It would only take a group two hundred people half a year to clear a site. You didn\u0027t really have to hire so many people. It was too wasteful.\" Zheng laughed. \"I don\u0027t have the time. The curator probably told you already that I am not from this world. My comrades died in another mission so I can\u0027t waste any time. I have to pay a price to come back here. And because the price is so high, I only have three months. The excavation must complete within three months at any cost. I need the Book of Amun-Ra to revive my comrades. That\u0027s why I asked you for help. I am too weak by myself. I need you.\" Ardeth gritted his teeth and said. \"Understood. Men of the desert won\u0027t forget a favor! I will use my power to influence the elders\u0027 decision. Some of our men said the Spear of Osiris appeared in a small country in Africa. However, it was stolen away afterward. I will sent people to investigate. Let us finish what\u0027s in front of us first. Don\u0027t worry, you will obtain the Book of Amun-Ra within three months. If the excavation isn\u0027t going fast enough, I will let our men help.\" Zheng suddenly thought of a possibility. Even though it seemed absurd but perhaps it was a coincidence. \"Hope the heaven will bless me.\" Zheng muttered as he looked out to the sky.
