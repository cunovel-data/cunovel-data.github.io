{"id":58308,"no":587,"title":"Vol 19 Chapter 8-3","content":"Silver light arrows spanned across the sky in two arcs. A careful count could realize there were over a thousand arrows. The arcs were slowly curving out as if an angel’s wings were spreading open. However, underneath the breathtaking sight was looming death!\n The men on the ground suddenly noticed the light wings descending as they spread. Before anyone could react, strands of energy blasted down and lighted the ground with silver sparkles. Each explosion covered a two meter area. Steel melted under the burst of energy and humans burned to ashes. The thousand strands of light landed in the mist of the crowded army and caused nearly three thousand casualties.\n A slight feeling of emptiness arose in his body. The rain of arrows drained all the energy from the energy stone and did not take anything from his Elven energy. The vast amount of energy was what enabled the huge area of effect. However, the user needed to expend energy to control the technique. This expenditure was large enough to give him the feeling of emptiness.\n (Looks like I am not suited for group battles. I am probably better at target focused ranged combat. Zero said there are various types of bullets for the Gauss sniper rifle in the exchange system. Some that requires ranked rewards possess huge AOE. Then there should be more than just enchanted arrows in the system. There must be AOE type arrows that are more powerful than this.)\n The thoughts merely lasted for an instant in Heng’s mind. There was something more important at the moment. He had to accomplish a feat he never even dared to dream of, to challenge twenty thousand people by himself. If he were to complete his mission, he could be awarded the legendary title, Slayer of ten thousand.\n The army fell into disorder after receiving such an unbelievable attack. The modernized army and military technologies in this world were limited to ground force, navy, and air force. Each type of army had their own systems and branches. The Japanese army during World War II was among the most powerful force in Asia. But even at this height, this army had never witnessed anything similar. With the silver lights taking away thousands of lives and mechanical objects, the soldiers lost their logical senses.\n The disorder persisted for over a minute before the officers regained control over the army. The crowd gradually calmed down then thoughts of retaliation arose. Yet, anti-air weapons during this time were crude when the altitude reached several hundred meters. Missiles and anti-air guns lacked both power and accuracy. The Sky Stick was a small target and moved incredibly fast. So even with hundreds of anti-air guns firing, their effect was minimal. Furthermore, there were still the Dragonshard barrier.\n “Can you tolerate this speed, YanWei?” Heng asked while controlling the Sky Stick to dodge.\n The whistling from the air ached YanWei’s ears. The Sky Stick was moving too fast. She barely heard Heng’s voice and tried to talk. Cold wind filled her mouth the moment she opened it. This in addition to the flying bullets scared her. Her arms tightly wrapped around Heng’s waist. She could no longer keep any distance from him.\n Heng was relieved when he felt the force from her arms. He put all his attention into the fight, or more accurately, battle. A battle between one man and twenty thousand.\n (I had only used tier D energy stones up until now. Tier C energy stones are as powerful as expected. Though the Elven energy I have doesn’t seem enough. I am not suited for larger scale battles right now.)\n Four waves of huge AOE light arrows later, over ten thousand Japanese soldiers had fallen. Most of the heavy firearms in this army were destroyed. Heng targeted the heavy firearms and transportation vehicles with Two Arrow Explosive Shots. Thus, nearly all the heavy firearms were destroyed.\n The Japanese army had exceptional perseverance after being brainwashed by Bushido. Over eighty percent of the soldiers were assimilated into the army. The fear from the huge number of deaths got buried under their hearts. The majority of Japanese soldiers in this era did not fear death. They overcame all types of disadvantages as displayed in the Battle of Midway and the Battle of Iwo Jima after a defeat on the ocean. However, the brainwash at the same time turned them into demons who massacred civilians and entertained themselves with tortures. Two other armies in Europe at this time and one army that was going to appear in China possessed similar traits. However, one of the army in Europe and the army in China achieved their perseverance and courage through different means. They also overcame the cruel and inhuman side that came along. Unfortunately, this Chinese army had yet to appear in the early days of World War II.\n Heng was battling a Japanese army that wouldn’t back off even one step after losing over half their men and nearly all the heavy firearms. Their rifles fired at the sky in futile. Machines guns and anti-air guns chased the Sky Stick. The shooting never once paused even as the light arrows continued to descend on these soldiers. They seemed to have no fear for death. Merely ten percent of the soldiers attempted to run but were quickly shot down by their comrades. The whole army went berserk.\n Heng still had enough energy to use the rain of arrows. However, he didn’t want to deplete all the Elven energy and didn’t want to spend the tier C energy stones. The Sky Stick dived to the ground. He seized a machine gun then sprayed against the ground. The Japanese soldiers fell in rows. Once he fired all the bullets, he dived down to seize another machine gun.\n “— That’s the situation. A Japanese army division received a devastating attack from us. Twenty thousand people either died or injured. This division no longer exist. All the air force that arrived for support were destroyed, totaling thirty aircraft.” Xuan said with a silver plate on his hand. “I believe the facts should be easy to verify. The destroyed division was not far from the front line. Or have you received report from the front line already?”\n A brief silence came from the other end. A man’s voice said, “I did receive expedited message from the front line stating the Japanese army’s retreat. However, destroying a whole division —“\n “You afraid to believe it or can’t believe?” Xuan massaged his temples. He picked up a piece of paper with his other hand and looked over it. “Logically and scientifically, my words are absurd lies to you. However, the fact is you received message of the Japanese army’s retreat from the front line and the disappearance of a division. You question what is this series of wars for. If gods and Xians exist in China, if flying swords and legendary items exist, we could have eliminated the Japanese army the day they invaded us. Or even early at the Battle of the Yalu River, the Eight-Nation Alliance, the First Opium War, the Manchu Conquest. Why did so many tragedies and humiliation wrote the Chinese history if we exist. Is that what you are thinking? Perhaps you wish this to be true so that China will finally rise. Perhaps you wish it to be fake because it’s impossible and we did not stand by and watch as your country suffered. Right? Mr. Chiang Kai-shek.”\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-8-03","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
