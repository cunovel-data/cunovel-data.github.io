Since you aren\u0027t immune to bullets right? Plus, my expertise is planting mines and setting traps. See if you can find these weapons.\"\n \n \n Zheng originally said the words with the intention of just giving a try. He didn\u0027t expect such an answer. He laughed bitterly because the people who attacked him with were comrades under Jie\u0027s control. They were people he could entrust his safety with. Planting mines and setting traps? Did he think this was some military exercise?\n \n \n Zheng immediately said. \"No, don\u0027t go through so much trouble. I need you to fight along side me, but I don\u0027t need the mines and traps, at least not now. So what\u0027s the situation over there?\"\n \n \n WangXia gave a bitter laugh and said. \"You just teased us. We can\u0027t eat the gold as food and we also don\u0027t know how to sell the gold. Furthermore, this is the U.S., we don\u0027t have a green card, or any documents of identification. We are afraid to even go to a park. Everyone\u0027s tired and hungry. We are now waiting under a bridge. If you didn\u0027t contact us, we were planning to contact you.\"\n \n \n Zheng was surprised, then as he thought about it, he laughed out loud. Even though WangXia was in the army, he still didn\u0027t have the power to threaten a bar owner and live comfortably like he did. These newbies were also in a horror movie for the first time so they probably felt anxious and at a loss. It was difficult for them to come up with a solution at their current state. \"Haha, don\u0027t worry. Which bridge are you at? I will send people to bring you over here. Although you\u0027re still going to die but I won\u0027t let you starve before then.\"\n \n \n He could hear a sigh of relief over the device. A moment later, there were cheers. It seemed like they were indeed very hungry.\n \n \n What followed were easy to take care of. Zheng determined their approximate location via the device then ordered a few thugs to fetch them. Four men and two women. They all looked like they had been through some difficult situations. Their clothes were dirty and the first thing they did was picking up a bottle of water until half the bottle was empty. Then they looked over the room.\n \n \n Zheng felt a little funny but also guilty. Even though they were just newbies but as the leader, he should take some responsibility for them. He sighed then pointed to the food on the table. \"You\u0027re all hungry right? Eat something first.\"\n \n \n The six of them were starving. Three of the men ran over to the table without delay and they all went for the roast chicken. A woman in suit cursed some words then carefully helped the blind woman over. She handed her some food with a mild laugh then also began to devour the food.\n \n \n WangXia though was rather calm. He looked over the room carefully then at Zheng\u0027s wound with a surprise. \"This wound is probably from a week ago? Is it an injury from the last movie?\"\n \n \n Zheng touched the scab and shook his head. \"Go eat something first. Human can\u0027t go without eating. Everything else can come after.\"\n \n \n WangXia nodded and sat over to the table. He feasted on a rate as fast as everyone else.\n \n \n Zheng was staggered by the sight. He had the owner prepare enough food for ten people before they arrived. Since it was three in the morning, quality food was difficult to obtain but there were fast food restaurants that open throughout the night. So they bought ten servings of burgers, roast chickens, colas. Yet, judging from their expressions, it seemed as though they were eating a most delicious meal.\n \n \n When the six newbies finished eating, all ten servings were gone but they still seemed only half full. Zheng didn\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry at this.\n \n \n \"Before I tell you what\u0027s happening, as usual I want to ask for your name and occupation. Please don\u0027t hide anything. I will assign your roles based on your situation or have people lacking in competence stay in the back.\" Zheng sat on the sofa and sipped a cup of tea.\n \n \n WangXia replied first. \"My name is WangXia. I was member of the special force. Codename Greedy Wolf, specialized in reconnaissance, counter-reconnaissance, planting mines and setting traps.\"\n \n \n Zheng looked at him with surprise. He thought WangXia was just a soldier, didn\u0027t expect him to be in the special force. If what he said was true, then he was a rare first tier player. His abilities should be comparable to Yinkong when she first entered.\n \n \n The woman in suit was rather open. \"Huang Lilin. I worked in a periodical office. Hm, half editor, half freelancer.\"\n \n \n An average salaried man said. \"Li Laoshi. Plumber. I started as an apprentice since fourteen and have been working in this field for twenty years.\"\n \n \n The man in glasses gave a laugh. \"Zheng Xue. Hoho, we stem from the same root. My occupation was a lawyer. Currently working in Hong Kong.\"\n \n \n The skinny and pale skin teenager said shyly. \"Wang Xiaohao. Uh. Don-don\u0027t have a job yet.\" He was either timid or hadn\u0027t spoke in a long time.\n \n \n Everyone then turned to the blind woman. She also knew it was her turn and smiled. \"Zhu Wen. I have sight mutation, not blindness. The world through my eyes looks strange so it\u0027s difficult to find a job. I worked as a fortune teller.\"\n \n \n The others showed an odd expression though she was rather indifferent, as if she didn\u0027t care for how others think. She sipped a cup of tea. That gentle feeling she gave off was so soothing.\n \n \n Zheng suddenly asked. \"What do you mean by fortune telling? Simply discussing a person\u0027s fate?\"\n \n \n ZhuWen smiled. \"No, I was hit by a car when I was a child. My optic nerves mutated so I can see an air of death that surrounds people who are about to die, or you can think of it as a sixth sense. I heard there are others with such optic nerves mutation, and the numbers were quite a few.\"\n \n \n Zheng immediately thought of Honglu, but Honglu had his whole brain mutated while hers was limited to optic nerves. However, did that mean she could sense Death\u0027s attacks? It would be the best way to guard against Death.\n \n \n Zheng said to her. \"Open your eyes and take a look at us. See who\u0027s most likely going to die.\"\n \n \n ZhuWen hesitated then muttered. \"I... I am afraid I will scare you. My eyes look horrifying. People usually get nightmares from seeing them.\"\n \n \n The others were shocked, because the conversation was going in the supernatural direction. The woman in suit was the first to respond. She laughed openly. \"You\u0027re such a beautiful woman. No reason to be scared. Hehe, don\u0027t worry. I have a brave soul.\"\n \n \n The others all agreed. The men were rather interested in this beautiful woman and no one wanted to admit cowardice at this moment.\n \n \n ZhuWen sighed. She slowly opened her eyes then looked at everyone. They were shocked the moment they saw her eyes. Those eyes were all white and protruded a bit. That combined with her long hair gave her beauty a ghastly feeling. If it was anyone alone looking at her, the person would probably scream.\n \n \n She was shocked and bewildered as she looked over everyone. Then she carefully looked around the room. After quite a while, she closed her eyes and sighed. \"It\u0027s dark. The surrounding is extremely dark, like we are standing inside the smoke that arose from the burning of corpses. We are going to die at any moment. Everyone is facing the same danger, like next second is the end of our lives. This is the first time I\u0027ve seen something like this.\"\n \n \n Zheng sighed. He knew the situation was critical but didn\u0027t expect it to be so bad. The six newbies could indeed die at any moment. Death\u0027s threat was ubiquitous. So She wasn\u0027t lying. She was a special talent.\n \n \n Just then, Zheng\u0027s communication device rang. He turned it on with curiosity and heard a young man\u0027s voice. The man cried. \"Save me. I don\u0027t want to die. Save me. Lu Chichuan died. I don\u0027t want to die yet. Ah...\" His voice stopped here then it was silent.\n \n \n No, there was still some noise coming through the device, the sound of blood spraying out. It sounded like an old man\u0027s ghastly laughter. So hideous, so terrifying, as if Death was laughing through the device.\n End of Volume 7: Final Destination of Despair\n Next, Volume 8: Final Destination of Despair II\n \n \n \n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-7-chapter-8-02","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
