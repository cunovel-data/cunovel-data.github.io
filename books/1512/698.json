{"id":58419,"no":698,"title":"Vol 22 Chapter 5-1","content":"As the ship headed towards Pearl Harbour, the two newbies had began to worry. After all, their strength wasn’t that great yet, and their bodies weren’t much stronger than ordinary humans. If several soldiers shot at them, Juntian would definitely die, except for Liu Yu, who might survive if he managed to luckily summon a card.\n That was why they were worried about dying from a stray shot while seizing the warship. Even with the protection of the dragonshard necklace, they would die if America no longer wanted the warships, and wanted them to die there and then, and fired an anti-ship missile at them. So, they worrisomely asked Zheng.\n “Although I don’t want to admit it… but isn’t this what we usually do?” Zheng was slightly astonished in response. After saying those words, he recalled after a long time that these two fellows were rookies, or basically semi-rookies. Their strength was weak amongst team China, and their experience wasn’t great. Their courage hadn’t yet been cultivated either. Thus, it was unavoidable to have some slight panic when meeting such a situation. After all, who in the real world would dare seize a country’s warship? Even terrorists wouldn’t dare. Only the God’s Realm teams, not of this world, would dare.\n (We don’t just dare. If Xuan were in charge, he wouldn’t consider it a big deal to destroy the world. Isn’t this what we do often?)\n Thinking to this point, Zheng laughed bitterly. The veterans of team China did indeed have a thinking completely transformed to that of a God’s Realm team. Survival and the preservation of a team’s power were the foremost priorities above all.\n Accurately speaking, every person’s mentality would experience a process of change upon entry to God’s Realm. They first needed to change from a normal person to a member of a God’s Realm team. Their mentality needed to change from that of the comfortable and peaceful real world, to either a bloody cruelty or courage in God’s Realm. One had to choose between these two mentalities, thereafter raising their personal strength, be it through unlocking the genetic constraint, getting more and better enhancements, or self-creating abilities. These were all the second step of their mental transformation.\n After these two steps, the third step, that would truly make a God’s Realm team whole was to wholeheartedly maintain the team’s power, letting the entire team continue on. In other words, they would continue developing. That was because in this stage, a team was incomparably important, whether for team battles, for the foundation of the final battle, someone to revive you after death, or someone to remember you.\n No matter what, although these two were rookies, they would one day mature, whether in power of mentality, until they could the bear their responsibilities in team China. They would then would become true members of team China.\n Zheng earnestly consoled them with a few sentences, saying that they had crossed bigger hurdles before. After all, if you think about it, during the counterattack in Independence Day, wasn’t it basically just seizing a warship? It was only that it was a space warship belonging to aliens. That had been much worse than provoking America, so there was no need to worry about something as small as provoking America.\n Seeing the two rookies walk off, sweating, Zheng laughed bitterly. The ship was nearing Pearl Harbour. Xuan suddenly took out several small tools, alone in the cabin as he hammered away at something. Everyone who saw him noticed the fanatical expression on his face, which looked so… yes, hideous would be the word to describe it.\n Just as Zheng dismissed the newbies, he saw Xuan come out from the cabin with a metal helmet. Xuan immediately walked over when he spotted Zheng, making Zheng immediately shout out, “Don’t even think about it! Don’t think about making me wear that! Dammit, what are you playing at this time?”\n Xuan ignored his fierce shouts, only indifferently saying, “I just completed the translations for the scientific techniques regarding the ‘soul’, as well as the research about the consciousness. This is a tool created based on the scientific techniques in the manual. It can connect two people’s consciousness. Although it’s only the outermost layer of the consciousness, its safety is greater than the time you saved Yingkong. There aren’t any side-effects. It’s usable on those that haven’t entered the fourth stage… probably.”\n A bad premonition suddenly formed in Zheng’s heart. He hurriedly asked, “What’s probably? What if there are side-effects using it?”\n Xuan turned his head away. “Merely some some problems in the consciousness.”\n “If you say it’s just some small problems, why are you turning your head away?”\n Zheng was truly exasperated. He immediately rejected. “Don’t give me that. Don’t even think you can make me wear that. We’re also right about to capture team East Sea’s psyche force user. Do you think I’m omnipotent, when you want to send me, a non-psyche force user, into someone’s consciousness?” \n Xuan frowned. He sighed, “I’ll roughly explain to you about this matter. A human’s conscious exists in their brain, or it can be said that the operation of the brain created a consciousness. This matter’s explanation is too complicated, and I can’t explain it to you with your intelligence. As an analogy, the consciousness would be a water bottle. It can basically be divided into the ego and subconscious. If we take the ego as the liquid in the bottle, the subconscious would be the bottle in place to protect our ego.”\n Xuan was however, very patient. He actually found a spot to sit down and continue.\n “A normal person’s consciousness is roughly like a water bottle. As every consciousness is different, the size of the bottle would be different. So, some would become easy to hypnotise, while some people hard. Similarly, the liquid’s quality and various other factors would determine whether or not an organism is a psyche force user. Alright, I’ve finished my explanation of a human’s consciousness in general. Next, we’ll move onto the proper things.”\n “First, a person’s conscious would usually take place at the surface of the liquid, which can be called outer surface of the mind. The part where hypnosis takes place in is the middle level of the liquid, the inner mind, or the non-memory consciousness. There’s also one more, a level of the consciousness untouchable through science, and the bottommost layer of the consciousness. I call this the Anima, which is the level for the Light of the Soul, or abilities like the A.T. field you spoke of before.”\n “For those sleeping now, their conscious is roughly between the middle layer and bottom layer. The longer they sleep, the more their consciousness sinks within the liquid, until it’s unsavable. If we don’t capture team East Sea’s psyche force user this time, they’re dead whether or not there’s a final battle.”\n “At the same time, the quality of the bottle and liquid will improve the further the genetic constraint is unlocked. The defense would also be higher, if something external invades and attacks. This was why I could let you save Yingkong before. She’s unlocked a very high stage of the genetic constraint, so you could forcefully breakthrough. However, that wasn’t the case for the rest. If you did it forcefully did it, there was an over forty percent chance of their consciousness collapsing and them becoming a vegetable. So, there’s a need for you to find their consciousness in the sea of consciousness, and slowly guide them out of the heart’s devil state. Although you can’t wake them up, you can bring them to the middle layer so that a psyche force user can use forceful methods to wake them up. The probability of success then would be eighty percent.”\n So it turned out that he was to be the bridge between the psyche force user and the one being saved? Also, it was to help Xuan test his new creation...\n Zheng laughed bitterly. The result of this was the same as before. Although he was sure Xuan had some conspiracy within, he couldn’t reject the trap everytime. Xuan was just too crafty.\n Whatever the case, Zheng finally agreed to Xuan’s request. He wore the strange thing and entered Lan’s and the rest’s consciousness. In his eyes, that fellow Xuan had a devil’s tail behind him swinging to and fro. Although the fellow was peacefully eating an apple, this appearance would make anyone’s hair stand on end.\n (You’d best pray you don’t land in my hands, or else…)\n In truth, Xuan hadn’t landed in his hands yet. As Zheng muttered internally, his vision blacked out, and he lost consciousness.\n “We’ve almost reached Pearl Harbour. Prepare for battle.” Xuan no longer looked at Zheng, and threw the finished apple overboard. He proceeded to the cabin everyone was gathered in.\n At the same time, in an area of the sea far from team China, a vessel was braving the raging waves, with the Senkaku Islands as its destination.\n “How far are we from Senkaku Islands?”\n A man stood at the prow of the ship. His face was filled with strange, black runes. The falling rain actually didn’t wet his body, merely vanishing when it got within half a metre of his head. From far off, a hemisphere could be seen around his body.\n “About four more days. Team China probably shouldn\u0027t be able to chase up to us.” Behind him, a stunning young lady, wearing a very traditional Japanese kimono, was currently holding a wooden parasol.\n The man sighed hearing this. “Whether or not they chase up to us, all we can do now is do our best to rush over to Senkaku Islands. Dammit! We obviously have such a strong opponent, but all we can do is run! How humiliating.”\n The young woman sighed softly as well. “Although that’s the case, we really can’t tangle with team China. This team is the second strongest team that defeated team Celestial. We simply can’t beat them. So, why not we give our best in fleeing, and stand together with team Celestial in the final battle? That way, we still have a chance of survival.”\n The man shut his eyes. He howled loudly, abruptly drawing the longsword sheathed at his right waist. Brandishing it with his two hands, he slashed towards the sea. A streak of radiance swept past, parting the rain and creating an area of vacuum twenty centimetres thick. This light blade then landed on the sea, completely disappearing.\n “Tell the captain full speed ahead! Destination! Senkaku Islands!”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-22-chapter-5-1","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
