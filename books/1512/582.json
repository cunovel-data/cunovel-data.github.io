{"id":58303,"no":582,"title":"Vol 19 Chapter 7-1","content":"Zheng was quick to respond. He dashed toward Jonathan the moment he heard the voice. Zheng had not let his guard down the past day and night because the distribution of power among this party was heavily skewed. He was among the most powerful players in the whole realm, but TengYi was not a combatant, LiuYu was still a newbie, and the rest were unconscious. The only two people in this party with the ability to fight were him and Imhotep.\\n\\n Jonathan ran incredibly fast at a speed that could win a gold metal at international sprint competitions with ease. However, the Yellow Turbans were faster. In just a few steps of running, a huge hand smacked down from above. This smack would make him one with the ground no matter how much miracle he could pull.\\n\\n Dong! A sound echoed from behind him a split second before his life was over. Zheng used Soru in Instant Destruction to flash forward and blocked this attack.\\n\\n The Yellow Turbans’ arrival was too unexpected. he did not activate enough Qi and Blood Energy at once. A majority of the usable Qi and Energy was consumed by Instant Destruction so when he finally clashed with the hand, he was mostly using strength from the body. The hand that held Tiger’s Soul turned numb and sore. He was sent flying several meters back.\\n\\n (Their strength increased by 50%. These Yellow Turbans are evolving type monsters. Their strength increases with each resurrection… Does that mean we can become invincible in team battles if we obtained their crafting recipe?)\\n\\n Zheng was knocked flying due to a lack of preparation. He was still in the third stage during this time. Qi and Blood Energy began to accelerate in his body as his thoughts flew. He stepped on the ground and dashed at the Yellow Turbans again. It had not retrieved the huge hand at this time. Tiger’s Soul sliced across. The mist-like light blade shredded the huge body to bits. Zheng entered Instant Destruction again to use Soru and appeared next to another Yellow Turban. The next second, his blade sliced across…\\n\\n “Not looking good.” Zheng said with a serious tone.\\n\\n The whole fight lasted less than twenty seconds. The Yellow Turbans were huge and possessed enormous destructive force. However, none of them took Zheng more than one strike under his overwhelming power. The light blade easily shredded the Yellow Turbans which relaxed the rest of the party relaxed when they saw how easy the fight went. So they looked to Zheng with confusion from hearing his words.\\n\\n Zheng said, “It has only been a little over twenty hours since I last destroyed them in Shanghai. Their previous resurrections probably took longer than that right?”\\n\\n Jonathan said, “Uh, yeah. It took at least several days before.”\\n\\n Zheng nodded and twirled his hair. “I believe their resurrection length and growth are related to the last person who destroys them. Which means the more powerful this person is, the shorter it takes for them to resurrect, and the stronger they become. They are like an intelligent system that adapts to the enemies… I tested their growth just now. They are about 50% stronger. If the pattern persists, the following six days will become our most difficult trial!”\\n\\n The Yellow Turbans would eventually surpass Zheng as they continued to grow without limitation. Furthermore, they couldn’t be killed.\\n\\n (That’s impossible. There is no absolute force in this world. The more powerful the force, the more constraints are placed on it. The Yellow Turbans would have been the most powerful weapon if this resurrection and growth are limitless. And the Saints and Cultivators wouldn’t have disappeared. There must be a flaw to the Yellow Turbans. I just need to find the flaw.)\\n\\n “Still awake?” While Zheng was pondering, TengYi suddenly sat up and said to him.\\n\\n Zheng laughed, “Aren’t you awake too? Hoho. I am thinking of some things. What’s it?”\\n\\n TengYi hesitated for a moment before taking a piece of paper out from his pocket. “I have been helping Xuan translate the documents you brought back from the Lord of the Rings. I have a bad feeling about this bonus mission. The God it mentioned might be more powerful than we imagined.”\\n\\n Zheng was surprised. “Why do you say that? Did you discover something?”\\n\\n TengYi nodded. “The word God is a special noun in the documents we translated. Gods are weapons developed by the Cultivators called Xian. It takes a human or a Xian’s soul as its consciousness and possess a genetically engineered body. Its energy is drawn from Soul Force. God is the ultimate weapon developed during the height of the war between the Saints and Cultivators… Have you seen the anime Evangelion?”\\n\\n “Uh?” Zheng pinched his hair and said. “Yes. I have seen it.”\\n\\n TengYi continued, “Xuan made a hypothesis regarding the crafting process of the God in the dimension after achieving this translation. He thinks our God is the fusion of the souls of the Saints and Xians. All the enhancements, genetics, and manuals in the exchange system once belonged to man. Perhaps the previous players created them, or perhaps the creators of God inserted the information. If the mentioned God from the mission is a bio-weapon, it should be exchangeable from the exchange system. The truth is, Xuan has found it.”\\n\\n Zheng was dumbfounded. “The exchange he deduced to be God… it couldn’t be that thing right?”\\n\\n “Yes. It takes a rank S reward, the Eva units. All the units from the anime aside from the most expensive Test Type are in the system. Xuan believes those are the Gods the Xians developed.”\\n\\n Zheng pulled a strand of hair from his forehead and said, “Are you sure you remembered it correctly? Is it Xuan’s hypothesis or the translation of the documents?”\\n\\n TengYi said, “Xuan deduced that Eva is another name for God. The rest are from the documents.”\\n\\n “I get it.” Zheng exhaled. “If Gods are the ultimate weapon the Cultivators developed, they should have prototypes before achieving the final Gods, or something that led to the development of the Gods. The Yellow Turbans are probably the experimental subjects or in a sense, an incomplete God. I think I understand the intention of the Cultivators who created this mission. They want us to adapt to the God’s power step by step. That’s why the Yellow Turbans are attacking the person with the Buddha head. So once we enter the Sky Tower, we won\u0027t get killed for being unprepared. However, the Saints of the West modified the Yellow Turbans to be able to resurrect and grow indefinitely, or at least up to a certain point.”\\n\\n TengYi sighed. “Be careful. A bad feeling lingers within me just like the time before I entered this realm. The last tomb I entered gave me the same feeling and unfortunate events happened.”\\n\\n Zheng laughed lightly and patted him on the shoulder. “Don’t worry. I am much stronger than you think. I can protect you guys. But you’re right. You could be in danger if God is so powerful and the Yellow Turbans attack us at the same time… Let’s get YinKong awake. Xuan gave me a useful item.” He took out the glasses from the ring, an item Xuan wanted to him to put on YinKong.\\n\\n “I have a feeling that Xuan’s items are dangerous but… let’s test its function. Hehe.” Zheng laughed as he looked at YinKong.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-7-01","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
