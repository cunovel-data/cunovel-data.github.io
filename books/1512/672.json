Apart from the time the main character rode his dragon mount to go save princess Arya, a description of the royal capital hadn’t really appeared. This Eragon was also no longer a movie, but a truly rational world, with a capital more colossal and magnificent than in the movie. It could also possibly have an existence that far surpassed the Eragon movie...\\n\\n “This is what I’ve been worried about. Logically speaking, nothing should really make Imhotep scared. Although energy weapons and magical items can indeed harm him, his personal strength should be sufficiently strong. Even the magician in the original plot won’t necessarily be able to beat him. If Imhotep can’t win, he would definitely still be able to flee. What exactly is this power that is making him fearful?”\\n\\n Zheng jumped off the stone pillar, while using the silver metal piece to talk to Xuan.\\n\\n “Hmm…” The consciousness on the other side seemed to be absent-minded, and only going through the motions when it replied.\\n\\n Zheng didn’t take offence, but continued talking. “If I didn’t guess wrongly, I feel that this movie shouldn’t be as simple as we imagined. It should have something that exceeds the scope of Eragon’s plot, which should be that power that made Imhotep fearful… What do you feel? Xuan, I’m talking to you! Put down the documents in your hands!”\\n\\n Even if Zheng didn’t look, he knew that Xuan should be researching those Cultivation techniques up in the sky. He didn’t know exactly how many screws this fellow had loose. Recently, Xuan had been researching Cultivation techniques as if he no longer cared about life. The rarely seen fanatical expression had now become commonplace. Those around who had seen this had gotten goosebumps, with Zheng feeling apprehensive himself.\\n\\n Xuan on the other end put down his documents helplessly, before showing an indifferent expression. “What do you want to ask? We’ve encountered things that exceeds the plot many times in other movie worlds. Every movie likely has something that exceeds normal, and these usually pose a great threat to teams. It’s not as if you don\u0027t know this. What’s the point of making a fuss?”\\n\\n “That’s not what I mean…” Zheng shook his head. “As we’re getting closer and closer to the final battle, especially with Honglu and you sure that it will come in one or two movies, don’t you think that God will tell us something in this situation?”\\n\\n Xuan sighed upon hearing this. After a long time, he continued speaking, “I originally didn’t plan to analyse this for you. That’s right. God indeed hasn’t told us many mysteries yet. So, in the remaining movies, there will likely be mysteries that God will hide within them. But this isn’t what you should worry about or go understand. Your only goal now should be to raise your strength. Since you can’t win in mental state over your clone, then you can’t lose in strength too much. Do you know what I’ve been doing?”\\n\\n “Er, what have you been doing?” Zheng asked, baffled.\\n\\n Xuan snapped his fingers. “I’ve been trying to research Cultivation techniques as fast as possible. Perhaps you yourself didn’t notice, but your power level, or so to say the future you have chosen, has surpassed the paths that God set for us. You’re neither a possessor of Cultivation techniques, nor are you someone who purely relies on unlocking the genetic constraint to get stronger. Or, you can think of it as that you’ve combined the specialties of the Saints and Cultivators. Although we can’t see anything special so far, but that’s because you don’t possess true Cultivation techniques. Perhaps all the groundwork laid before… is for the sake of a metamorphosis in the final battle! This is why I’m so anxious to understand Cultivation techniques. So, even if this movie world truly has something left behind by God, use the Magic Cannon to resolve it if it’s too dangerous. Before the final battle, I hope not to lose powerful chess pieces or combat power that can be used to scheme. Understood?”\\n\\n (The scheme for the final battle. Although that “powerful chess piece” sounds grating, this should be a special address Xuan said as he doesn\u0027t know how to express his feelings towards his comrades. This dishonest fellow, he was researching Cultivation techniques specially for the final battle?)\\n\\n Zheng sighed. “Understood. Under the condition that my strength can deal with it, I will probe this thing that exceeds the Eragon plot. If my strength can’t deal with it, I will decisively use the Magic Cannon, so as to not bring danger to everyone else. All is for the sake of the final battle, is that what you mean?”\\n\\n “Correct.” Xuan looked at the documents in his hand once again as he spoke. “Even if it means giving up on abandoning the heart’s devil… I will let team China safely pass the final battle, and let team China ascend to the apex of all the teams. Even if only one person is left, team China definitely shall not be exterminated!”\\n\\n (Xuan…)\\n\\n Since very long ago, roughly when they were fighting the giant dragon in Jurassic Park and the others had thought Zheng had died after he used Destruction for the first time, he had suspected that Xuan already had emotions. Or, perhaps to say, the emotions hidden in his heart were finally starting to surface from the deepest levels of his subconscious. Every movie after that had deepened those emotions of his. This seemingly unfeeling man was actually as pure as a blank sheet of paper. Or perhaps, he was a boy, as his inner heart seemed to have stopped since childhood. In truth, the emotions he had always been seeking had always been buried deep in his heart ever since his father had brought him to see the stars...\\n\\n (So, just like the dedications that have persisted throughout his life, whether it’s the dedication towards the unknown, towards the largest probability, towards emotions, towards the senses… It can be said that, second only to emotions, team China is the thing he is most dedicated to in his life. Since we called him a comrade, since he became a comrade of ours, everything he has done has been him working hard for his dedication. Is that why, even if only one person is left, team China must survive? Xuan…)\\n\\n Zheng didn’t know what he was feeling. When he switched off the silver coloured metal piece, his mind continuously recalled all his experiences after entering the realm since Resident Evil. Xuan dying, Zero dying, Jie dying… till the great changes in Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Then until continuously reviving everyone, then Explosion, Destruction and the battles of wit. Everything he had experienced in his time in this realm seemed extremely long and profound compared to what he had experienced in the decades before. This was where he battled and survived!\\n\\n (I understand! Even if there’s only one person left, team China must stand at the apex amongst the teams in the realm. Team China must live on! Definitely... Eh?)\\n\\n Zheng contemplated as he walked, and was so engrossed that when he turned around a bend, he ended up colliding into a two metre tall red-skinned Urgal. These Urgals were King Galbatorix’s standard troops, a savage race with battle prowess surpassing humans. This group of ten plus Urgals had superior equipment, and actually looked to have the fierce impression of a king’s guard.\\n\\n Zheng and that Urgal froze at the same time. Then, that Urgal’s head was directly blown off. The powerful force not only easily caused the head to collapse, but also sent the corpse flying over ten metres away, sending the two Urgals behind him crashing into a wall together with him. Those two Urgals immediately turned into a bloody pulp, while the Urgal whose head had exploded more or less had his body torn to pieces and his bones crushed.\\n\\n “Since we’ve already met by accident, I won’t be polite then.” Zheng kneaded his fingers, coldly smiling as he walked slowly towards the Urgals before his eyes.\\n\\n A minute later, the passageway was fully covered with the corpses of Urgals. Only two Urgals, their arms broken by Zheng, were rolling about nonstop on the ground. However, they didn’t dare to shout out loudly. Just now, any Urgal who had let out noise had been instantly turned into a bloody pulp by punches that couldn’t be caught by the eye. As Zheng’s attack speed was too fast and that enormous force demonstrated an overwhelming dominance, these Urgals didn’t even display the most basic resistance. It could be said that Zheng already existed at a level of power above them. It was a completely different level of power, just like how humans overlooked the ants on the ground.\\n\\n “Do you know where princess Arya is being locked up?” Zheng smiled coldly, asking the two Urgals.\\n\\n The two Urgals were in abit of a daze. They obviously hadn’t recovered from the shock of losing. An elite team of beastmen soldiers actually hadn’t even been able to touch their opponent’s clothes. This human’s strength was simply too great. Was he a Dragon Rider?\\n\\n BANG!\\n\\n A boom echoed out. Zheng’s punch went through one of the Urgal’s head to his waist, and his entire upper body was smashed into pieces. Zheng had overused his strength. Ever since he had used Chaos, Genesis Splitter and hadn’t died from it, a certain change had naturally occurred in his body. In the time since then, Zheng’s control over his strength had largely weakened. Actually, it wasn\u0027t that his control had weakened, but that his power and speed had once again substantially increased, together with his body strengthening once again.\\n\\n (At this rate, am I going to become a monster? Or, have I already long since been an inhuman monster to others?\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-21-chapter-5-1","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
