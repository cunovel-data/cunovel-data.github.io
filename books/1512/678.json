{"id":58399,"no":678,"title":"Vol 21 Chapter 7-1","content":"“Why?” Zheng’s heart found it strange, but his eyes stared at the hundreds of millions of reptiles, not understanding why so many reptiles would mutually massacre each other. After a short while, a quarter had been eaten by the rest, and the number of reptiles was continuously decreasing.\\n\\n “Because these words can’t be said. Even knowing about it isn’t allowed. I’m afraid that when the two of us step onto Earth, a large number of organisms from other planes will appear on Earth, and the calamity they’ll cause will lead to massive casualties amongst humans. Human society will radically change… What good calculations and schemes. So, it turned out God’s Realm was like this…” Xuan sighed, then said. \\n\\n “What does that mean? Why can’t I understand you?” Zheng thought about it himself, but couldn’t understand what these words of Xuan meant.\\n\\n Xuan shook his head. “They didn’t leave behind a complete last message probably to remind us of something. The box creators can use a certain method to know if we discover their existence. Or perhaps when the existence of the box is discovered, they’ll erase us. This is similar to how we are erased when memories of leaking information about God’s Realm appears in our mind, when we return to the real world from God’s Realm. The box’s creators won’t directly erase us, but instead send organisms from the infinite other planes to attack Earth. Some of these organisms from the infinite planes would be like those that’s appeared in the movies we’ve gone to through God’s Realm. Perhaps there may be mechanical organisms like from Transformers, genetic organisms like Aliens, giant dragons of the mythological and magical type, or ghosts like from the Grudge. This is one of the purposes for God’s Realm’s existence. Apart from training powerful evolved humans, it would also familiarise us with various unknown monstrous threats through the various worlds. That’s why only after we become strong can we resist these planar crossing monsters.”\\n\\n “The second use is to be humanity’s stronghold. When humanity can’t resist these organisms, they can escape into and temporarily rest in God’s Realm. And through the devastation of this monster tribulation, more evolved individuals will appear among humanity, after resting in God’s Realm. Even if the creators outside the box discover the existence of God’s Realm, they would need to expend more effort to enter as it’s a box within a box. By then, we would have long since become strong. If it still doesn’t work out, the powerful humans can create ANOTHER box within to continue hiding and conserving strength. Good scheme. The Saints and Cultivators then already thought through humanity’s path of retreat. It’s just that…”\\n\\n “Is the final battle really the end?”\\n\\n Xuan shook his head but didn’t speak. He only lowered his head and observed the magic runes on the door, and said, “Wait there for a while, and try your best to stop those organisms from crawling out of the hole. If they enter the fourth floor, they’ll be counted as within the castle boundary, and we’ll have to kill these monsters. Zheng, the battle has begun. That is the price for answers.”\\n\\n “What does that mean? Can these reptiles harm me?” Zheng asked, baffled.\\n\\n Without even mentioning he was over a thousand metres from the ground, with his strength he wouldn’t fear these reptiles even if he was on the ground. Before the reptiles could surround him, he would have long escaped their attack range. How could there be any mortal danger? As for Xuan mentioning about not letting these monsters get to the cave entrance, that was even more outrageous. How could these monsters get to the cave entrance ten thousand metres above the ground when they couldn’t even fly?\\n\\n But, what happened next astonished him. The reptiles below had already massacred each other till there was only a fifth of them left. An outer layer of skin formed over their skin. This outer layer of skin bound them within and formed countless cocoons, quietly set up on the blood red ground… It had truly become blood red ground by now. Not only was the colour of the soil blood red, but there was also the fresh blood from countless reptiles on top.\\n\\n These meat cocoons started breaking apart several tens of seconds later, and various organisms ranging from one to two metres in height appeared. They all had blood red bodies, but differed in shape. Some were monsters with multiple legs like a spider. Some monsters were like dogs, possessing four legs and sharp teeth. There were some shaped like a fat human, and many indescribable disgusting abominations. The multitudinous monsters were several tens of millions in number, and were densely packed, completely covering the ground till infinitely far off. Even if Zheng was a thousand metres in the sky, he still felt incessantly nauseated watching the ground. These numbers were simply too terrifying.\\n\\n Something even more horrifying then began. Those organisms actually began to massacre each other again, mutually devouring one another as before. It was even more brutal this time, with only one in a hundred surviving. Then, those monsters who had eaten their fill transformed into cocoons once again, except the cocoons were much bigger this time. Several tens of thousands of giant cocoons were on the ground. The blood coloured ground was the colour of fresh blood as always, only that the colour was much deeper.\\n\\n “I see. I’m afraid there’s one more thing the Saints and Cultivators wanted to let us know. The enemy can also evolve the same way we teams do, or at least, similarly. They will breakthrough on the edge of life and death…” Zheng was finally serious. Ignoring everything else, the numbers below was enough to make him serious.\\n\\n The evolution this time went much slower, and the organisms only gradually succeeded in their evolution several minutes later. Their build was much bigger than before, and their forms had a greater range of evolution. There were several a few metres large beasts with three heads and sharp teeth, giant demons with wings grown on their back, ferocious giant lizards, and incomparably fat multi-handed and multi-legged monsters. The forms of these monster were truly in accordance to demons of the Abyss in Dungeons and Dragons. Perhaps, God had guided modern humans into creating the rules of Dungeons and Dragons.\\n\\n Those giant demons with wings grown on their back were several thousand in number. Their power obviously surpassed that of those monsters in their surroundings. All that could be seen was them pulling over the surrounding monsters, biting at and devouring them. Those monsters were unable to even resist, and were torn into shreds and entered the mouths of these three metre plus demons. When they had eaten their fill, these demons actually extended their wings and flew towards the hole on the sky. The remaining monsters didn\u0027t seem aware of it yet, and started their massacre and devouring once again.\\n\\n These demons didn’t fly too fast, and were far from comparable to the Sky Stick, and their flight seemed slightly jerky. Even so, the dense and dark mass of several thousand giant demons flying over was breath-taking. At the entrance of the hole, Zheng was alone in blocking it, and was the first to be attacked, with several tens of giant demons in the lead nearing Zheng.\\n\\n There was a soft noise, and Zheng already had Tiger’s Soul in hand. Although he didn’t know how powerful these giant demons were, he immediately activated Explosion to stop any from flying into the hole. The Sky Stick’s speed far exceeded that of the demons, and in the blink of an eye, tens of demons in the lead were sliced into pieces, like a knife going through tofu. Zheng didn’t pause, and was like a wolf among sheep as he charged into the throng of demons. Within an instant, hundreds of demons were already injured. It seemed that they looked more impressive than they actually were.\\n\\n (...No. Just based on physical strength, all these giant demons don’t lose out to Aliens. They’re even slightly stronger than ordinary Aliens. Within a short time, there are now already several thousand of them. If they go to the real world, there will really likely be a city destroyed…)\\n\\n It was unknown how long it would take for those giant demons to fly to the giant hole ten thousand metres in the sky. Zheng had long since completely killed everything that was on his way here. When he exterminated this wave of giant demons, he discovered another hundred plus meat cocoons formed on the ground. These giant meat cocoons were seven or eight metres tall, and were all blood coloured.\\n\\n (Although those previous giant demons possessed great power, they couldn’t use energy. These monsters are at most of greater numbers and strength. Eliminating them isn’t hard, and that hole is ten thousand metres up in the air. The ordinary monsters can’t even fly out. Those that can, I can easily kill them off. Unless… these monsters can evolve to even stronger than me, or can come in an unending stream until I’m exhausted to death?)\\n\\n Just as Zheng faced those countless monsters, as well as their evolution, Xuan was currently hurriedly taking action. No one was clearer than him on the horror of these monsters, as based on his speculations, the Saints and Cultivators wouldn’t easily hand over this information to them, especially when the box creators would immediately start attacking those in the know after they found out. If the weak were allowed to find out this important information and bring it back to the real world, humanity would immediately meet a calamity. Perhaps they wouldn’t immediately become extinct, but they wouldn’t be far off from it...\\n\\n So, the Saints and Cultivators would definitely test the strength of those who obtained the information, and it would be through an extremely brutal method. Surviving would give the right to possess this information. Failure to survive would lead to everyone dying in this movie world, so they couldn’t go back to the real world and cause a disaster for others.\\n\\n (Thus, there’s no longer any need to consider the young dragon’s growth. This movie world has already become an extremely extremely terrifying world. We have to live on, IF we can survive this…)\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-21-chapter-7-1","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
