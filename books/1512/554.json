{"id":58275,"no":554,"title":"Vol 18 Chapter 12-10","content":"\"Amazing!\" The three men gasped. TengYi and WangXia were also suspicious. They had seen YinKong use The Shining Air Wave but that power was definitely far away from this attack. Its range also did not extend up to two hundred meters.\n (If I can use this ability to its fullest potential, the range should be at least five hundred meters. This body isn\u0027t strong enough. It had been dead for so many years after all. The unlocked mode also only goes up to the lowest level of fourth stage. It\u0027s up to Xuan now. Hope he has a way to make me alive again.)\n YinKong looked at the men with a smile and said, \"I suddenly want to live. There are some things only the living can do. Death takes all the burden away but you also won\u0027t be able to do anything, whether it is to weep or repay for your sin. Even suffering will only continue when you are alive.\"\n No one understood what YinKong meant. They thought she was expressing her feeling toward the desperate situation they were in so no one said anything in reply. The party fixed their eyes at the incoming helicopter.\n The helicopter stopped at a thousand meters away and then fired another air-to-ground missile.\n After YinKong blasted the missile with the Air Wave again, WangXia said, \"Can the Air Wave reach further? The helicopter is about a thousand meters away!\"\n YinKong\u0027s eyes remained cold as ice and sharp as a blade. She replied with a smile, \"It can\u0027t hit so far. But if I throw the sword up..\" Her arm moved with a throwing action.\n They did not see anything being thrown but they knew she had thrown the invisible sword.\n It might had been an illusion, WangXia and TengYi thought they saw black ancient characters surfaced on YinKong\u0027s arm. In just a blink of an eye, her arm returned to normal and they thought their eyes just lost focus for that moment. At the same time, the front window on the helicopter exploded as if something smashed the helicopter from the front. The helicopter wavered for a few seconds until it finally dropped to the ground. The helicopter exploded in a loud boom.\n \"See? All good now. It\u0027s an armed helicopter this round. If we continue to stay in this world, he will eventually come back with a force that not even I can fight against.\" YinKong said. \"When the time comes, we are dead.\"\n The three who were in an excitement after witnessing YinKong easily shot down a helicopter sighed. Freddy was growing more powerful by the second. Who could tell how powerful he would get? What if ten, a hundred, a thousand armed helicopters swarm them?\n YinKong was going to say something when she suddenly looked to the distance. The men\u0027s eyes followed.\n In the open space far away, ChengXiao was carrying Heng on his back and running toward them. He could barely catch his breath. \"YinKong. Haha. I saw my YinKong…\"\n There was no overreaction from YinKong as she used to had. Her smile remained warm and gentle and so was those cold eyes. As the two people approached, she flashed over to behind their backs.\n ChengXiao and Heng were both surprised. Heng immediately turned his vision around while raising his bow to aim. However, YinKong put her hand on the bow and said, \"Good, it\u0027s Heng and ChengXiao. Sorry I have to test you in case you are Freddy.\"\n \"That\u0027s the right thing to do… Anyway.\" ChengXiao said, \"I don\u0027t know why but I suddenly find myself liking you more than before. Is the gap in your heart a lack of feminen attractiveness? And you gained it when you overcame it?\"\n YinKong winked at him. ChengXiao was completely stunned and in the next second, he was flying backward. He fell on the ground after flying for ten meters then immediately jumped back up. Judging by how he was only rubbing his butt, YinKong had controlled her force. Heng wasn\u0027t injured so she grabbed a hold of him before knocking ChengXiao away.\n \"So Xuan has gotten so powerful already?\" YinKong asked.\n ChengXiao was putting his full attention on piercing needles onto Heng\u0027s legs.\n Heng clenched his teeth at the tingling sensation then replied with a bitter smile, \"That\u0027s probably not even Xuan\u0027s real strength. I can feel his power is still growing. Furthermore, he still can\u0027t use gun-kata and the Lambda Driver at the same time. Otherwise, we would have been dead.\"\n \"Is that so?\" YinKong blinked her eyes and suddenly laughed. \"We will leave the four arrow Explosive Shot for next time. Can you show me the three arrow shot? I want to see its power.\"\n Heng looked at his fingers. All five fingers were red and swollen. The four arrow Explosive Shot damaged his tissues. He had to heal every time he practiced this shot in God\u0027s dimension. So even though YinKong requested it, he wasn\u0027t in the condition to use even the two arrow shot.\n ChengXiao stabbed two needles into his arm and wrist. He twirled the needles and said, \"Dude, it\u0027s impolite to refuse a beautiful girl\u0027s request. Not to mention a big breasts baby face…\"\n YinKong knocked his head with a giggle. ChengXiao was overjoyed and reached out for her little hand but at the next moment, he was flying again. Though he quickly got up and ran back like a cockroach.\n Heng paid no attention to ChengXiao. He circulated the nearly depleted energy in his body. The swelling had subsided in just ten seconds after stimulation from the needles and his energy, which enabled him to use his bow for a brief period. He placed three +4 enchanted arrows on the bow and fired at a big tree a thousand meters away.\n Pah-pah. The arrows collided midway. The final arrow accelerated to a speed that not even YinKong could catch with her eyes. That smile on her face turned to a more serious expression because the arrow cut the tree in half and continued flying for several thousand meters.\n \"Not even this three arrow Explosive Shot could break the Lambda Driver\u0027s barrier?\" YinKong sighed.\n Heng nodded. \"The theory behind the Explosive Shot is to merge the forces of multiple arrows into one through collision. The final arrow\u0027s force grows exponentially by the number of arrows. However, gun-kata is probably a counter to this technique. It does not rely on his eyes to catch the arrows. The calculated shots in every direction tend to shoot down the arrows before collision. I could only use this shot when he was unable to use gun-kata. If he\u0027s still alive, he probably gained the power to use both gun-kata and Lambda Driver by now… I won\u0027t be able to hit him anymore even if I can use the four arrow Explosive Shot again.\"\n Neither ChengXiao nor Heng wanted to have YinKong fight Xuan after they witnessed Xuan\u0027s power. YinKong was a strong fighter in the team but her chance of winning was almost nonexistent. The only person stronger than this Xuan at the moment was only Zheng.\n YinKong nodded then stopped talking. She sat there and waited. The other five people began to discuss a way to beat Xuan.\n (The stronger the power, the more restrictions it has. Xuan in the real world is definitely not an issue. I just have to wait for the five minutes of Lambda Driver to be over and I can kill him in an instant. However, without this time limit, is the Xuan in this world invincible?)\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-18-chapter-12-010","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
