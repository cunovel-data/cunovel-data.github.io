{"id":58361,"no":640,"title":"Vol 20 Chapter 8-1","content":"In some ways, the United States of this era was the most prosperous country in the world. Its economy, military, and technological advancement peaked over every other country. Military and technology alone might not win a war but the United States was the most prepared to execute a counterattack after the aliens\u0027 first strike on the Earth. It had more fighter jets in reserve than pilots, which led to the awkward situation of insufficient pilots in mankind\u0027s second counterattack after the first one failed and most pilots died.\n Air Force One glided through the golden wave of daybreak. Most people in the plane had recovered after a night of rest. No longer did anyone appear as distressed as they had right after the escape yesterday. However, the groomed appearance did not represent a similar state of the mind. When reports of the lasers\u0027 destructiveness came in, the American politicians blanched.\n In the sky within the United States territory, three Destroyers floated. The three laser strikes wiped an equal number of big cities from the geography of the U.S. and destroyed all surrounding towns and freeways. The economic damage was unfathomable and the casualties suffered were in the tens of millions.\n \"Sir. The air force is ready for launch.\"\n In the command center of the Air Force One, only those who stayed unconscious and those who didn\u0027t serve a critical role in this situation were able to sleep. Garrisoned troops and soldiers in vacation were assembled in urgency through the night. The people in this room were planning their grand counterattack. The night was long but when everything was finished, Venus was high up the sky. Everyone was exhausted.\n Team China\u0027s reputation surged after the great escape from yesterday. Security cameras on the Air Force One recorded Zheng\u0027s transformation and boost of strength and speed outside the plane. The crack he tore open and the footprints he left on the tail of the plane were evidence of his shift away from mortals. With these, the story team China told had a much higher probability of being true, which also illustrated the extend of extraterrestrial technology. The aliens had achieved a height that mankind never dreamed of. One step further and mankind would believe them as gods and legends, just like how Cultivation was viewed.\n The president looked at the people in the room with a worn-out face. That was when he finally noticed everyone held the same wearied look. He lightly coughed to grab the people\u0027s attention. \"Order the air force to launch our first counterattack. Order the army to approach the three ruined cities and rescue survivors… if there are any.\"\n This was the first of two counterattacks mankind would launch against the aliens. The outcome of the first attack was utter disaster. Only one fighter jet managed to shoot down an alien ship by luck and survived. The majority of jet pilots died in the battle which resulted in a lack of pilots during the second battle. That was the movie director\u0027s way of portraying an emotionally moving plot and passionate characters. The United States government in an actual movie world probably wouldn\u0027t go so far.\n Team China did not express any advice during the meeting. Not that they had no advice to give since they had full knowledge of the outcome of this counterattack. A prophecy at this time was pointless and would only serve to create suspicion among the American politicians. The counterattack would proceed and the outcome would not change in any meaningful way. Furthermore, this loss was the prerequisite for the team to reach Area 51.\n \"One point I am curious about is was it your full strength you used to save us yesterday?\" The president was resting in the room next to the command center. The outcome would arrive in a few more hours. The president planned to have a conversation with team China during this time.\n Zheng contemplated. \"No, it wasn\u0027t. The plane would crumple if I used any more strength. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what you want to see. You wouldn\u0027t be thinking I can defeat a bunch of City Destroyers by myself?\"\n The president chuckled. He picked up a few cigarettes and handed one to Zheng then threw the rest to the other men from team China. \"How do you feel about this counterattack?\"\n Before Zheng got to answer him, the president continued. \"You don\u0027t have to tell me. Our chances are pessimistic when the aliens have such advanced technology. I am prepared to receive the message of our loss. Frankly, the gap between our technological level is too big to be compensated by men, geography, and environmental factors. This is a war that determines the future of mankind… You might feel unbelievable at what I am about to say. A thought lingered in my mind after I witnessed the power you displayed yesterday. Is it possible to form an assault squad with your group? Ride a rocket into the enemy\u0027s base and infiltrate the aliens. They won\u0027t be able to deal with you without utilizing big weapons given the power you possess. However…\"\n The president weighted his words then sighed. \"It almost certainly equates to death. The only glimmer of light you would see is if the Nords smile at you. Even after the mission is completed, it would be nearly impossible to return. I can\u0027t bring myself to propose this plan.\"\n \"A rocket.\" Zheng murmured. He gave the president a bitter smile. \"If it\u0027s a rocket you are thinking, I apologize I will not let my comrades throw away their lives. Do you think a rocket can fly into the aliens\u0027 base? That\u0027s impossible… On the other hand, if it\u0027s an alien ship that you struck down and can function, we might be able to cosplay aliens and infiltrate them.\"\n The president also laughed bitterly. Neither could he imagine a rocket flying into the alien base. That would only happen if everyone in team China could survive without oxygen, could fly in outer space, had powerful bodies that no weapon could damage. Only if they were Superman.\n \"An alien ship that has fallen. Sigh. Let\u0027s wait for the outcome of our first counterattack. Maybe by then we will have obtained a functional spaceship.\"\n (Functional spaceship? They are going all to be functional when you can\u0027t even strike one down.)\n The plot changed but it changed for the worse for mankind. The president headed to the command center after the conversation with team China. He quietly waited for the fighter jets to arrive at their destination. An unexpected message but one still within the bounds of reason arrived. Mass alien army appeared. Those were not the aliens\u0027 air force. They were spider like infantry units with six legs, a length of over ten meters and stood eight meters tall. Approximately a thousand spiders were unloaded from each Destroyer. Even without witnessing their power, the size and figure of the spiders could allow them to look down on the human forces.\n The second bad news was the spiders moved out from the ruins and had already captured numerous civilians. Fortunately, the aliens only killed those who retaliated with firearms and no massacre happened yet. The air force squads finally arrived at their destinations. Contact with the alien forces would commence in two more minutes.\n \"Washington squad and New York squad have locked onto targets.\"\n An officer by the receiver turned around and said to a general that looked about fifty years old.\n \"Fire at will.\"\n \"Fire at will!\" Several officers shouted at their mics. Then those on the receiving end transmitted the order to the pilots in the front line. Thus, a cruel battle commenced where those in the command center could not see. All they had was the screen of a radar and all they could do was speculate based on the screen. The communication officers soon blanched as messages came back from the front line. Fighter jets were dropping one after another. The pilots reported their inability to penetrate the Destroyers\u0027 defenses. Visible barriers emerged as missiles flew near the Destroyers and blocked off all attempted attacks. Numerous saucers that were two to three times bigger than fighter jets flew out from the Destroyers. These saucers were also protected by the same barriers. And so, the human air force lost over seventy percent within minutes while the alien air force remained intact. The losses were growing by the second.\n \"Retreat… we have lost.\"\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-20-chapter-8-01","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
