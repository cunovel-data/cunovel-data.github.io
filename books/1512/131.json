Isn\u0027t this too much?\" Zheng had lost himself. It seemed like he was totally shocked by these points and rewards. \\n\\n \\n\\n Honglu finished the spider legs, leaving its body and head and laughed. \"It isn\u0027t too much, at least about a thousand points less than I guessed. Hehe. But it\u0027s still a lot. If I am not wrong then the amount of points God gives out is correlated with the difficulty of the movie. The more difficult it is, and more likely you are to die, the more points he gives out. This is probably it.\" Then he took out a worm from the basket. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two women couldn\u0027t look straight at him anymore. Yinkong was better off but Lan\u0027s face was pale and she kept massaging her stomach. She forced a smile and said. \"But the Alien movie we went through was more difficult than The Mummy, yet we received less points and rewards than this one. Is that because of the team battle?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Honglu finished the worm by now and put his hand into the basket again. Everyone\u0027s gaze was fixed on his hand until he took out a sandwich before they let out a sigh of relief. \\n\\n \\n\\n Honglu said. \"Don\u0027t you feel that we are very fortunate during this team fight with team India? To be honest, I had prepared to die in the beginning but we survived with six people at the end. We are very lucky that we countered them. Think about it, they have a strong team. Their psyche force user could monitor the whole battlefield and control our weaker members. We were fighting under their radar. They had information of our every move, every word we said, even our plans. They would at least not lose even if they were against a team stronger than us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then, everyone realized it was not a normal sandwich but filled with centipedes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This psyche force user could also cooperate with the needle user for an unbeatable pair. Unless the opposing team had something like a defensive shield, they could just stay in distance and kill everyone off. That\u0027s the power of a team. We don\u0027t have such complementary powers in our team. This is also what I am confused about. Team India was strong but not overpowered, otherwise we wouldn\u0027t have beat them. But how did they learn to choose complementing enhancements like this? Why didn\u0027t we do so? I think our team is missing something, or someone that guides us to what we should enhance. I\u0027ll call this person the leader.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Honglu put his hand into the basket and took out a can of cola. Just a normal can of cola. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So we were fortunately to survive with such a disorganized team, and had just the right powers to counter them. It is fate that let us live, or you can call it luck. We should be proud.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Honglu took a sip and pulled a string of hair. \"Their strongest psyche force user was countered by someone in our team. And judging by the fact she didn\u0027t appear toward the end, she was probably killed. Then Zero was almost invincible in such a large battlefield. In fact, it was Zero\u0027s existence that held team India back the most.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then God determined we were the weaker team and gave us the Book of the Dead. Oh right, Zheng, did you take the book from the movie?\" Honglu asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n Zheng immediately activated the ring and took out the book. This book actually came out of the movie with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Honglu nodded. \"This is the last deciding power of our victory, the Book of the Dead. Furthermore, someone from our team could actually read it. I have to say it was extremely lucky.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll also have to mention the stupidity of team India.\" Honglu sneered. \"Perhaps I don\u0027t understand how foreigners think or were they just stupid? I don\u0027t get why they didn\u0027t go all out in a fight in the beginning. If they had done so from the start, we would have been wiped, although it would probably cost them a few lives. And now? How should I describe it? They didn\u0027t have the determination of a player!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Honglu got on the ground and frowned. After a while he asked Zheng. \"Was there any movie that was easy in the ones you\u0027ve been through? Oh and can you know what the next movie is?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Zheng paused for a moment. \"It can\u0027t be easy right? We were on the brink of death several times. To be honest, if it wasn\u0027t being so close to death, I wouldn\u0027t have reached the second stage of the unlocked mode. As to knowing the next movie, how is it possible?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Honglu snapped his fingers. \"Bingo! That\u0027s right! Had you noticed the clothes team India was wearing? Aside from a select few, almost everyone of them were in robes suitable for the desert. Maybe it was a coincidence since there was an Arabic but I am more pronged to believe they knew what the next movie was. That was why they could exchange weapons and enhancements suitable for each movie. If that was so, then why don\u0027t we have such ability?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Simple deduction leads me to believe that 1. we didn\u0027t do something. Like if this was a game, we forgot to talk to some NPC or didn\u0027t obtain a quest item, or didn\u0027t go to a specific place, and the progress of the game is stuck. So God didn\u0027t activate some options and we couldn\u0027t know what the next movie is. 2. Lan said that their leader ran away in the end of the fight. I think someone that had reached the second stage of the unlocked mode wouldn\u0027t be so weak mentally. He should be someone that has the courage to face death and fight for his life, yet he ran away. I can only believe that team India was stronger than us only because the movies they experienced were easier and could obtain more points. While we have to struggle for a chance to live every time. That made us weaker but also gave us the courage to fight. So my question is, what didn\u0027t we do? Why did we have to struggle so hard every time?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Zheng looked at Lan and also noticed her gaze. They both thought of a name, Jie. The only one that could tell them something was Jie. \\n\\n \\n\\n Honglu looked at Zheng and smiled. \"I\u0027ll leave that to you. Leader. Hoho, you\u0027re the leader after all. So I\u0027ll leave diplomacy to you. We will move on to the next topic. You\u0027ve so many points and rewards this time, so have you thought about what to exchange yet?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Zheng smiled. \"This is the most I\u0027ve seen since I entered this world. I am planning to get my Vampire bloodline to rank B then it should increase my blood energy pool by a lot. I haven\u0027t thought about the other enhancements yet. Do you have any suggestion?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Buy mini surface to surface missiles.\" He laughed. \"One that can destroy all lives within a kilometer. I checked it, it\u0027s only 2000 points. Inexpensive and powerful. What do you think?\" Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-7-chapter-1-02","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
