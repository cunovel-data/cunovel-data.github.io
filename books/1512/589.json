{"id":58310,"no":589,"title":"Vol 19 Chapter 9-1","content":"While Xuan\u0027s party was working against the clock to get in touch with all the powers for the Buddha statue, the countdown for the next wave of Yellow Turbans were looming near. The first group contained barely any combat strength aside from Zheng. This was decided during the split since he was the strongest member of the team. Imhotep could count as strength but his abilities were mostly effective against living organisms and ineffective against spiritual beings like the Yellow Turban. Furthermore, spiritual and magical attacks could break through his defense. The Yellow Turbans were the bane of his existence. The only outcome that awaited the group if Zheng wouldn\u0027t wake up before the Yellow Turbans came was a wipe.\\n\\n \"Is this really going to work? They said the time in the dream has gotten faster but the only thing I see is Zheng frowning more frequently. Why isn\u0027t he waking up after so long?\" Jonathan asked.\\n\\n No one had the faintest idea. TengYi showed a bitter smile, \"WangXia didn\u0027t make it clear what time will he wake up, what he is actually doing, or what we should do. We can\u0027t just wait here, do we? We will die if the Yellow Turbans attack us.\"\\n\\n Everyone\u0027s expressions shifted. LiuYu said with a hint of hesitation, \"Xuan should know of our situation here. Why didn\u0027t he send someone to help us? TengYi, you said he\u0027s insanely intelligent.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. He is...\" TengYi confirmed him. \"He\u0027s too intelligent that we are insignificant in comparison. We can\u0027t know what he\u0027s thinking. Maybe the rest of the Buddha statue is more important than our lives to him. This isn\u0027t a team battle so our deaths will not weigh down on the team.\"\\n\\n LiuYu shivered. He was baffled. \"He wouldn\u0027t do that right? Aren\u0027t we comrades?\"\\n\\n TengYi smiled bitterly. \"I can prove that he\u0027s not doing it on purpose. Way back when our team was still weak, we experienced the movie The Grudge. He turned himself into a chess piece in that movie and died. His death brought the team an important piece of information to survive the movie. Perhaps in his mind, that information was more important than his own life… With that being said, it is possible that he currently thinks the statue\u0027s pieces are more important than our lives.\"\\n\\n The three movie characters weren\u0027t familiar with Xuan so they did not react. LiuYu on the other hand still had a boy\u0027s mentality and was shocked. Once the excitement from entering this realm had gone, the realistic issue of surviving was presented in front of him.\\n\\n \"I want to go home. I miss my parents.\" LiuYu cried out. \"I want to go home. I really want to go home!\"\\n\\n The adults looked to each other at a loss. TengYi patted his shoulder and said, \"Don\u0027t cry. You are not the only one that wants to go home.\\n\\n \"... We all want to go home.\"\\n\\n Home… only those who had traveled away from home would come to realize it was the place they longed to return to the most.\\n\\n Zheng also wanted to go home, to the one in the real world. There was no need to worry about surviving in that place, no need to anxiously await the next movie world, no need to fear the death of his comrades...\\n\\n Of course, the chance of him returning to the real world was impossible in YinKong\u0027s dream. Though he thought YinKong\u0027s group hadn\u0027t returned to their home for quite a long time.\\n\\n It had been a long time since he entered this dream. He didn\u0027t count the days but he estimated it to be at least half a year. He worried about the safety of TengYi\u0027s group and the incoming attack from the Yellow Turbans during the first month. But as time passed and there was no sign of the dream ending, he left their destiny to fate. He was still alive after half a year so that meant time was moving extremely slow outside the dream. Maybe it would be just the blink of an eye after he woke up. With this in mind, he focused his attention on YinKong.\\n\\n YinKong\u0027s background shocked him after he heard the Assassin\u0027s Clan\u0027s secrets. This girl was so strong before she even entered the realm. Though the more important question was the clan had a connection to God\u0027s Realm. The secrets also answered the question was there ever anyone who left the realm? The answer was yes.\\n\\n Here came another question… The people who left God\u0027s Realm probably gained unimaginable powers, unlocked to the fourth or even fifth stage, all kinds of enhancements, abilities, technologies, magical items that wouldn\u0027t exist in the real world. A single dead player at the fourth stage and a genetic related technology created this group of unlocked kids. What about the rest of the players who left the realm? What were they doing?\\n\\n The more Zheng learned, the more he things he learned that he didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n Zheng tried to wake himself from the dream during this half year. However, it failed no matter how much he used his Qi, Blood Energy, Refined Qi, and all his abilities. He did discover a secret though. When he emulated YinKong\u0027s mode of thinking, it seemed as though he could influence the YinKong in the dream. He was still experimenting this discovery. If he managed to get in contact with this YinKong, he might be able to make it out of the dream.\\n\\n YinKong and the other kids had been living on this uninhabited island for the past half year. They never once left the island as if the clan had forgotten about them, leaving them to die on this place.\\n\\n Zheng learned from the kids\u0027 conversations that the clan elders who designed this project wanted and at the same time feared the kids\u0027 power, which turned into this situation. The kids were allowed to return home for two months every year. Three more months before they could return again. This rule applied to everyone who were moved here, including YinKong.\\n\\n Zheng was quietly observing YinKong as usual. She was swimming in the sea to catch fish. The speed, precision and strength disproportionate to her little body that were bestowed by the fourth stage made even catching sharks a possible task.\\n\\n Zheng watched the slender girl swam in the sea. Her nude body was as beautiful as a mermaid, a beauty beyond mortal women. Though she was not exactly a kid anymore as her body was starting to mature. Zheng\u0027s eyes wavered away in embarrassment. YinKong suddenly sped up. A sharp tree branch that was held in her hand pierced into a large fish\u0027s stomach. She pushed the fish and knocked it out of the water. YinKong also leaped out out the water like a dolphin and kicked the fish tens of meters away onto the beach.\\n\\n (Incredible control over her strength. Her raw strength is still weak. She doesn\u0027t have Qi nor Blood Energy like I do. Nor does she have any special ability. I can defeat her if I were to use Destruction. The Mystic Eyes, the Lambda Driver or Heng\u0027s bow could also put her in a disadvantageous position… However, her control over her strength is simply incredible, even stronger than mine.)\\n\\n Zheng had been marveled several times already. The same feeling kept repeating itself every time he witnessed the girl using her strength. Because he knew that strength could come easier than control over the same strength. Infinitesimal control was the state of absolute control over strength. YinKong was exerting this control at its maximum.\\n\\n (Why did she become so weak if she\u0027s so strong at this time? Furthermore, her past is completely different from this dream when I revived her. Was her memory altered? Who altered it?)\\n\\n While Zheng was scratching his head, YinKong swam to the shore. She dried herself with a towel on the beach then started to get dressed. But as soon as she put her clothes on, her body trembled and her knees dropped on the beach. Her hands dug into the sand. Blood like redness saturated her eyes.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-9-01","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
