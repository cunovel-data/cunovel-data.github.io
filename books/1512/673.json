Without waiting for him to continue speaking, the remaining Urgal’s entire body had already gone limp and he fell kneeling to the ground, and he began to say all he knew in an unceasing torrent.\\n\\n “Lord magician is controlling that elf princess. Yes, only magicians can deal with magicians. No, you can too…” This Urgal had already been scared silly. Not only was he stammering, there was also some incoherence.\\n\\n Zheng frowned, He naturally knew after watching Eragon that that so-called magician was king Galbatorix’s number one subordinate, a magician who could summon creatures from the demon world. In the original movie, he was a powerful magic user who was even better than elf princess Arya who also used magic. In the final segment of the movie, he had almost killed Eragon, and could be said to be one of the rare powerhouses in Eragon.\\n\\n “That’s alright as well. Directly disposing of him is fine…” Zheng softly whispered. He then said to the Urgal, “Bring me to the residence of this magician. Don’t play any tricks. I don’t know how many guards that disturbance just now attracted. It’s very easy to abandon you and find someone else to lead the way.”\\n\\n The Urgal nodded continuously in terror. He reluctantly stood up from the ground, his entire body trembling. He drew strength from some unknown place, and simply continued to go down this passageway. On the way, they continuously met Urgal guards that were hurrying over. Of course, them coming only just added to the corpses on the ground. The current Zheng was like how Xuan had spoken of before, an overwhelmingly powerful strength that could completely disregard the so-called ‘influence’ and ‘wisdom’!\\n\\n This city looked magnificent from the outside, as it was after all built against a mountain. It looked rather like the ancient castles of Europe’s Middle Ages. But it wasn’t too large, and simply couldn’t compare to the giant cities of ancient China. However, when Zheng stepped into this city, he realized their previous estimations had been wrong. This castle was bigger than they had thought, as this castle continued deep downwards. What was shown of the entire underground castle from outside wasn’t even a tenth of the actual body.\\n\\n “Oh? You all are only the guards for the outer perimeter? What living things are inside? That’s right, where’s your king, Galbatorix?” Zheng asked as he walked. The Urgal leading the way was the one he had captured before. After the massacre on the way, this Urgal had long since killed off the notion of escaping. After all, he had personally witnessed Zheng bare-handedly killing over a hundred Urgals. This strength simply wasn’t something a human should possess, so this human before him had already been determined to be a demon by him long ago.\\n\\n “Inside are the creatures from the demon world that Lord magician and His Highness summoned. The maximum we can go to is the second underground floor. The soldiers guarding there are Black Knights. We don’t know any more after that. Lord magician stays at the third underground floor. As for the king, he seems to stay at the lowest floor of the castle…” The Urgal replied carefully.\\n\\n (As expected. This castle does have power that exceeds Eragon’s plot. Why does it sound so familiar though? Dragon Riders, underground castle, magicians, giant dragons, Black Knights… Isn’t this just Dungeons and Dragons? With endless rules, and countless gods. Wizards and demons fill and walk the world. Whatever planes of existence, whatever demon world… Planes? That’s it! Planes of existence!)\\n\\n Zheng’s thoughts suddenly moved. He thought of the planes of existence in Dungeons and Dragons’s rules. Every plane had its own laws, as well as different coordinates and sizes. The universe was filled with an infinite number of planes… wasn’t this similar to God’s Realm? Every world was different. It was either the power of magic that was prevalent, or the power of technology. There was even a countless number of monsters and other living things. Wasn’t all this exactly what God’s Realm exhibited?\\n\\n (Could it be that the true meaning of this Eragon movie is at the bottommost floor of this castle?)\\n\\n Zheng thought as he walked, the Urgal and him slowly making their way down a set of stairs again. Suddenly, for some unknown reason, his entire body began to shiver the moment he stepped onto this floor. The Qi and Blood Energy within his body began to churn, with his Qi especially, beginning to automatically flow, the same way it would when he exercised.\\n\\n The Urgal’s body began to shiver all over as well. It looked like it wasn’t due to fear, but a natural reaction of the body. This floor was obviously much cooler than the floor above. No, accurately speaking, it should be a kind of negative energy that made people feel a faint coldness.\\n\\n “We aren’t allowed to go further down from here onwards. We’ll only be allowed to move things to the third floor when Lord magician occasionally needs heavy things moved.” The Urgal said as he shivered.\\n\\n (He’s no longer familiar with the next part of the road. I should catch a Black Knight. I don’t know what kind of creature that is, so I might as well estimate its battle prowess at the same time.)\\n\\n Zheng frowned as he looked at the Urgal with broken arms in front of him. The Urgal seemed to sense something, and looked in terror at Zheng. After a long time, Zheng sighed, “Go. Run away as far as you can. I can’t recognise you anyways, so the next time I see you I’ll be making my move instantly. Understand? You’re on your own, good luck.” Finished speaking, Zheng ignored the Urgal and proceeded to the depths of the passageway.\\n\\n Each floor became larger the deeper down the castle you went, appearing to be an inverted funnel shape. Coupled with the simple and unadorned stone floor and that gloomy passageway, this underground castle really had that queer flavour of Dungeons and Dragons. However, Zheng didn’t have the mood to sightsee and examine anything. He randomly walked all over the place following his senses. After a short while, he slowly became clearer about the topography here.\\n\\n “Xuan, this is the second underground level. I’ll continue downwards. Yingkong, continue to explore the upper levels. See if there are any strange places. Imhotep, have you obtained any useful news from the merchants in the market?” Zheng searched for a short while and finally found a staircase leading down. Standing at the staircase area, he opened the silver metal plate, fulfilling his duties as the leader as he asked the other two their situations.\\n\\n “No important information. However, they seemed very afraid of discussing the matter of the elf princess Arya… Right, there’s an interesting piece of information. I heard them talk about a myth in this world. Supposedly, a long time ago mankind and dragons didn’t fight side by side, and Dragon Riders didn’t exist. Then, demons invaded the world. Dragons or humans alone couldn’t resist those demons. Thus, they cooperated and formed the Dragon Rider battle team. After a long battle, they forced the demons back to hell, and sealed the entrance to hell… right below this capital. How do you find this information?” Imhotep replied.\\n\\n “The entrance to hell? That’s an important piece of information. I’m now at the entrance to the underground castle. I don’t know what’s down there, so leave it to me to check it out first to be safe. We’ll do it like this. Everyone, do your own job. Xuan, pay attention to the situation over at Zero’s side. If anything happens, notify me. Understand?” Zheng said seriously to Xuan. In the end, there was only silence. That fellow, Xuan, was engrossed in Cultivation techniques again.\\n\\n “Whatever. I won’t pay attention to that idiot. We’ll just do our own jobs.” Zheng closed the silver coloured metal piece, rubbing his head as he walked into the third underground floor.\\n\\n There wasn\u0027t much difference between the second and third underground floor, but the aura of that negative energy being thicker. As Zheng was confident due to his skill, he casually walked in the passageway, unafraid of any possible traps or other living things. Before a minute or two had passed, the clanking sounds of armour resounded from a distance. Sure enough, when Zheng turned a corner, a group of black armoured soldiers appeared.\\n\\n The bodies of these black armoured soldiers were completely covered in the armour, and that armour continuously let off a greyish-black aura. Their appearance actually had some similarities to the nine Ringwraiths in Lord of the Rings, only that their armour wasn\u0027t as shocking or luxurious.\\n\\n “Black Knights? They really do look mighty.” Zheng looked at the group of Black Knights twenty metres away. The group was about twenty strong, and were orderly arranged in formation. When they saw Zheng’s existence, they had practically the same speed and posture as they withdrew the two-handed giant swords from their waist. If they weren’t formed up in succession, they would have looked like mirror reflections of one another.\\n\\n The width of the passageway was around three metres. If they swung around two-handed heavy swords, only two Black Knights could attack him. However, this was enough, as the Black Knights had sufficient might. The foremost Black Knight swung his sword when he was several metres from him, actually generating wind blades that sliced at him. Although it wasn’t too powerful, there would definitely be blood if it were an ordinary person.\\n\\n Zheng frowned. His foot stepped down, and he charged at this Black Knight. While it still hadn’t withdrawn its two-handed heavy sword, he directly struck out with a punch at the Black Knight’s chest. The sound of metal colliding burst out. Shockingly, only the chest of the Black Knight sank in from the punch, and it pushed several Black Knights behind it several metres away. Then, it walked onwards as if nothing had happened. \\n\\n April Fools guys! JK, this ain\u0027t the real chapter. Did you really think we would randomly have DnD in Terror Infinity?
