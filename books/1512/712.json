{"id":58433,"no":712,"title":"Vol 22 Chapter 9-2","content":"Overall, the initiative lay with team East Sea in this engagement. After all, they had a psyche force user, and they at least wouldn’t be ambushed while moving. They also had mental and physical preparation before combat. In such a battle, if there wasn’t too much of a disparity in strength, the side without a psyche force user would almost surely lose, especially when it was a two on one.\n However, this was if there wasn’t too much of a disparity in power...\n Yingkong’s walking speed wasn’t too fast. She looked incomparably relaxed, going at a trot and her hands making the posture of holding a sword. When the distance between team East Sea and her was one corridor, she suddenly waved her hands, and the invisible heavy sword in her hands slashed towards the side of the corridor.\n There was a soft tearing sound. The transparent heavy sword ripped through metal like it was paper, a horizontal slash actually cleaving apart the walls of the passageway. It directly crossed the wall, chopping towards the two outside the passageway.\n Before Koinu Maosu could respond, Miyata Kuraki’s expression abruptly changed greatly. He suddenly pushed Koinu Maosu down, while his unsheathed his katana, moving it upwards. The sound of metal colliding rang out and the katana nearly shattered. However the force still sent him and Koinu Maosu sliding several metres back, only stopping after they slammed into the wall.\n “So strong…”\n Miyata Kuraki jumped up from the ground. He grasped his katana tightly, reciting something under his breath. Then, he anxiously said mentally, “Koinu Maosu! Transform quickly! This is an extremely powerful person! This is the moment our life and death will be decided…”\n As his words fell, the delicate figure of a girl emerged from the side of the passageway. Her footsteps were light, her hands seemingly weaponless. However, her hands grasped the air, seeming to be holding some kind of special weapon. She didn\u0027t look particularly intimidating.\n Koinu Maosu had originally been anxious, but he immediately jumped up from the ground upon seeing the current situation. “Kuraki, this is the so strong you spoke of? What a joke.”\n “Fool…” Miyata Kuraki didn\u0027t even dare look at Koinu Maosu. He merely mumbled, “Her killing intent are like vast waves, and it’s the first time I’ve seen one so dense. Can you not sense a single thing?”\n Obviously, Koinu Maosu indeed couldn\u0027t sense it. The disparity was so utterly vast that he couldn\u0027t even sense Yingkong’s level of strength. However, he could still be considered to be obedient to Miyata Kuraki’s words. He howled when he heard the order, the muscles all over his body swelling up as if they were alive, until his entire self swelled up by fifty percent, actually reaching two metres in height. He looked like a small giant.\n “HAH!” The muscles on Koinu Maosu’s body had finished swelling up. He pounced at Yingkong with a roar.\n Yingkong wasn’t flustered, charging forward to welcome the two. She raised Excalibur aloft, chopping downwards. She easily cut the muscles on Koinu Maosu’s body. Unexpectedly, the heavy sword only dug three tenths into his muscles. The muscles were as tough as steel, and Koinu Maosu closed in in the instant he was injured. The heavy sword was stuck in place, and Koinu Maosu had already crashed into her with a howl.\n Koinu Maosu’s enhancement should be similar to that man from team India in the past, or even the same. The Yingkong then wouldn\u0027t necessarily have been able to dodge this level of attack, and would have suffered some light injuries even if she had dodged. However, she had still entered God’s Realm for a long time after all.\n Her strength had risen by a large amount, especially with the resurgence of her main personality. In the instant Koinu Maosu crashed into her, the little girl placed her palm on the front of his body, and leapt up with a step. She passed over his head like he was a wall and jumped behind him. In the same moment she passed over, her two legs went in opposite directions and hooked his throat. It seemed that she wanted to use the momentum from passing over to snap his neck.\n However, it wasn\u0027t just Koinu Maosu present. Miyata Kuraki followed after hot on his heels. He wordlessly used the katana in his hand to slash as Yingkong’s neck like lightning. The strike was completely traceless, and as Miyata Kuraki’s swords arts had already reached a certain standard, even Yingkong had to abandon the attack on Koinu Maosu. She could only raise Excalibur to forcibly block this strike. With another clang, Yingkong used the force to retreat several metres away.\n (Not good, the gap from her is still so large…) Yingkong sighed slightly internally. If it had been her main personality just now, Koinu Maosu would surely have become a corpse lying there with its head snapped. The difference in strength was so large, the disparity remaining as wide as before even with her great improvements.\n “Again!” Yingkong shouted lovably. She charged forward once more, holding Excalibur. The first to be attacked was Koinu Maosu. The baldie had been frightened just now and was sweating buckets. His neck had been wrenched slightly, and was still secretly very painful. When Yingkong charged forward again, his right fist shot out with a loud howl. It came crashing towards Yingkong with enormous force, but just as the fist shot out halfway, Yingkong unexpectedly didn’t use her word to slash at him, but instead used her hands to grab his wrist. She went along with his momentum and jerked backwards, and the wrist was directed downwards.\n Koinu Maosu immediately howled miserably and subconsciously kicked at Yingkong. However, it let her push against it with a palm, allowing her to narrowly avoid an incoming slash. It was a close call, with the katana practically brushing against her hair as it passed. Only when she had retreated several metres did her hair slowly drift down. This time, even Yingkong was breaking out in cold sweat.\n (It’s too difficult. The other me’s strength has gone through an unknown amount of tempering, and has the fourth stage infinitesimal control to help. Only then can she handle difficult battles with ease and be peerless in close combat. My strength is still too inferior compared to her in the end…) Yingkong complained internally.\n She still had a stubborn disposition and wasn\u0027t the kind to give up. She shouted lovable again, “Again!”\n Finished speaking, she charged at the two again. Looking at her, it was as if she felt she had suffered some grievances. However, the two before her were quaking with terror. In actuality, her mentality wasn\u0027t much different from Zheng’s. She was using the two to test her techniques.\n “Maosu! Go all-out! This girl is incredibly skilled. We’ll die sooner or later if she holds us up here!” Miyata Kuraki shouted mentally at Koinu Maosu. At the same time, he made a backhand cut on his arm. He then unexpectedly began using his blood to rub all over his body. The odd runes all over his skin and face began to gradually emit a black light when the blood was rubbed over, and Miyata Kuraki’s entire body was shrouded within a layer of faint black light within a moment.\n “Team China’s combatant. The two of us fighting you is already a betrayal of the warrior code. If we weren\u0027t in a God’s Realm team, I would have faced you fair and square. My enhancement is the Ghost Knight [1], one who borrows the strength of ghosts and demons to achieve power. My companion’s is the Younger Toguro’s 90% Muscle Mass Enhancement [2]. We bear the shame of fighting two on one, and the burden of the lives of all the members of team East Sea… We need to capture you this day!”\n “Ghost Slash!”\n ***\n Zheng descended from the deck to the ship’s hold. As he ran over, he intended to pincer attack team East Sea together with Yingkong.\n His ears suddenly caught the sound of gunshots from not far off. He was intimately familiar with these gunshots. They were the gunshots of Gauss pistols, and his heart instantly jumped. His foot stepped down and he rushed over to Xuan’s room. Not only was the Bell of the East Emperor controlling Xuan there, so were the sleeping members and rookies. If they were captured, it would be difficult for them to extricate themselves.\n After running through several passageways, Zheng directly barged into the room. He was prepared to enter a battle with a stranger, only to see everyone sitting there safe and sound. There was only the addition of a corpse of a slender and tall man with an astonished expression lying there. His body was punctured with dozens of needle sized holes, marks of being struck by the Gauss pistol.\n “Xuan! Didn\u0027t you say you can’t move? You couldn\u0027t even go patrol, so how could you kill this team East Sea member? Don\u0027t tell me you tricked me again!” Zheng couldn\u0027t help but ask, after rushing over anxiously only to see a corpse.\n “Yes, I can\u0027t move about. But moving my hands aren\u0027t very difficult.” Xuan didn\u0027t even lift his head, muttering as he read his documents.\n “You…” Before Zheng could say anything, he heard a violent boom from a distance. The entire destroyer even trembled, then several more booms resounded. Zheng couldn’t say anything in time, and brilliance abruptly shone around his body. He borrowed this force to speed towards the place the booms came from.\n Zheng’s speed was incredible, and he had crossed several passageway in the blink of an eye. Footprints were left behind in his wake, and the passageway the booms had come from had caved in by the time he reached. A current of warm air rushed towards him, and much metal had already melted. However, there wasn’t a soul left in the passageway. Zheng didn’t hesitate to turn and leave for the ship’s hold.\n This back and forth didn’t even take ten seconds. When he rushed there, he saw three men and the unconscious Yingkong. They were currently riding on a giant eagle of length ten metre with its wings extended. The giant eagle extended its wings and brought the four flying away with an unordinary speed.\n Zheng’s Soru could naturally catch up to the three. However, when he saw that Yingkong wasn\u0027t hurt, merely unconscious, he finally slowed down and came to a halt on the deck. The three looked back, with a muscular baldie especially laughing hard. His hand grabbed Yingkong’s neck and lifted her up.\n “... Want to die?” Zheng’s eyes turned grim. He howled, a sound that the three naturally caught. They saw Zheng pull the railing next to him over, and snap off a metal rod.\n Without making any stance, he simply exerted force and threw it at the three.\n Before the three could recover from their shock, the metal rod had already embedded itself in the arm the muscular baldie was using to hold Yingkong. The force directly ripped his arm off, and the giant eagle was already several hundred metres away from the destroyer at this point. Gradually, the three and the giant eagle disappeared into the endless night...\n [1] Ghost Knight, alternatively named Male Slayer, is a class from the MMO, Dungeon Fighter Online.
