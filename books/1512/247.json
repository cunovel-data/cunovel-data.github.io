The sphere had an uneven surface, as if a huge hand knitted the metal together. The wall was gone and became a part of this sphere. \"Isn\u0027t this too powerful?\" Zheng looked at the destruction in shock. \"True. This is a different type of destruction from explosions. Explosions affect a larger radius but those outside the center usually don\u0027t take too much damage. The fatality area is within 10 meters. However, anyone within the area of effect of the gravity mine will die. You are no exception.\" Xuan said. Zheng felt a shiver down his spine. If he wasn\u0027t decisive and used Explosion immediately, he might have became a part of the sphere by now. That force of attraction might be able to reach beyond 200 meters. The gravity mine indeed belonged to a tier D sci-fi weapon. Xuan said to WangXia. \"The force of the mine is immense. It can even destroy military grade structures so you must be careful when handling it. You can take out a large pack of dinosaurs at once in this movie. If they provide rewards, you will earn the most out of us.\" WangXia was dazed as he stared at the sphere. He muttered. \"Damn. It was only a little ball. I wonder how powerful it can be if the mine was bigger.\" Zheng laughed. \"There\u0027s one called a Continental gravity bomb. It requires a rank S reward and 40,000 points. I can\u0027t say how powerful it is but most definitely beyond that of a nuclear bomb.\" Kampa and WangXia had no words for it. Xuan then said. \"My pistols don\u0027t need any testing. Gauss weapons wouldn\u0027t be too weak. Let\u0027s talk about your combat training.\" Zheng was confused for a moment and pointed at himself. \"My combat training? I didn\u0027t exchange any new weapons or abilities. I don\u0027t think combat training is necessary. I just have to keep practicing my blood energy and qi.\" Xuan took out a piece of paper. \"I calculated your movement speed and strength during Explosion and concluded there\u0027s room for improvement. Once you reach a limit, the power from Explosion will increase to an astounding degree that\u0027s able to take on the majority of movies.\" Zheng knew Xuan wouldn\u0027t say any empty words. If he said it was possible, then it would probably be the truth. He didn\u0027t know how Explosion could be improved so he listened to Xuan with full attention. \"This limit is the sonic barrier.\" Xuan adjusted his glasses. \"Have you ever felt that air became thicker when you run at full speed? Like air had increased in density or became a liquid? This slows you down. You have such strength and reaction speed yet you still need six seconds to run a hundred meters. This is proof that air has became an obstacle to you. You just haven\u0027t realized it.\" \"I did felt the change in air but what does it have to do with Explosion?\" Xuan said. \"It\u0027s actually about increasing your overall strength instead of just the Explosion. Have you ever seen One Piece? A group of normal people called CP9 mastered a technique called Rokushiki and became superhuman in close combat. Of course, that\u0027s just anime. I am not asking you to exchange the technique. However, through my analysis, if you are a bit stronger, faster and break the sonic barrier, you can make use of air.\" \"You can totally learn the underlying principle of Geppou and change your direction mid air. Or Soru to gain extreme speed. Or compress air to attack those further away. Your attacks will have a much wider variety which effectively increases your overall power by ten folds under Explosion.\" Zheng became excited. He was almost powerless against his clone. He could feel that the clone wasn\u0027t even using all his strength, perhaps not even half. That fight was over before the clone entered unlocked mode. If Zheng could master what Xuan said, then he would regain confidence to fight his clone again. \"Great! Let\u0027s try it now.\" Zheng ran up the basement stairs then exited the room. He connected with God to heal the injury caused by using Explosion. Then hurried back to the basement. Everyone else was still taking a break when they saw Zheng came back. He walked to an empty area then entered the Explosion mode. The hair thin blood vessels started to burst. And Zheng disappeared from everyone\u0027s sight, leaving two footprints embedded into this alloy floor. Almost instantaneously, an explosion happened in another place. Zheng appeared for an instant then disappeared again. The air rippled visibly like water. The world through Zheng\u0027s eyes was getting bloody as the blood vessels in his eyes burst. However, he finally broke through the sonic barrier. The air thickened when he used Explosion. He continued compressing the energy inside him until the air density felt like real liquid. When his strength and speed reached a point where he could break through this liquid, he stepped on them and ran up to the air. He suddenly swept his leg with enough force to break apart the liquid air. It created a vacuum blade where the tip of his foot passed through. The vacuum blade flew straight ahead and sliced into the floor. Before Zheng could see its effect, all the energy within him had depleted. The air turned from liquid to thicker to normal and he fell from midair. His skin began bursting apart and blood shot out from the wounds, painting him with blood. There was not a single place of intact on his body aside from several major blood vessels. All he could feel was pain and itch that he almost fainted. The other three people carried him up to the platform and healed through God. None of them got to see a two meter deep mark left by the vacuum blade. That was only the power through air.
