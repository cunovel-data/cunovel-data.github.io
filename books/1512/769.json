Strange numbers appeared on the computer screen, similar to the text Xuan gave Honglu. They were all random numbers without order to them, but that was only to the people behind Xuan. It seemed Xuan had grasped the meaning behind this string of numbers.\n “What does it mean? What is this all about?” Zheng suddenly asked curiously.\n Xuan frowned for a long time before suddenly asking, “Are any of team Africa still alive? What happened to their corpses?”\n “Haaaah. No survivors. It seems team Africa’s strength didn’t increase by much. They were actually wiped by just those two. Some even died horribly.” Zheng sighed.\n “In other words, their corpses are still around?” Xuan frowned again, before thinking about it and saying, “I can tell you the information I know already, but with a dangerous precondition.”\n “Dangerous… precondition?” Zheng immediately sensitively noticed the word dangerous. In fact, getting Xuan to say this word wasn’t easy. It wasn’t just difficult, it was a rare thing. He wouldn’t say it out no matter how dangerous it was, so as soon as he called something that, it was surely something stupefyingly dangerous.\n “Yes, correct. I already know more or less what’s going on, including what you can’t say, Luo Yinglong. But, it’s not that I don’t want to say, it’s that I can’t. Something dangerous will happen as soon as I say it.” Xuan looked at everyone.\n Luo Yinglong’s mouth twitched. “Isn’t that exactly the same as me then? What’s the point even if you know it?”\n “That’s why I said, there’s a dangerous precondition. But it’s not destruction.” Xuan suddenly said, “I suspect Adam has laid a scheme that has tricked all those who knew about the situation, whether you, my clone or I. Although I don’t know what he did, I have a fifty to sixty confidence in asserting this.”\n “Wait wait. Does your so-called ‘It’s not that I don’t want to say, it’s that I can’t’ refers to saying something out would let us get wiped directly by God? Like the restrictions whenever we return to the real world?” Zheng immediately understood what Xuan meant, and asked seriously.\n “Approximately that. But that’s just what everyone thinks. Everyone, including my clone, firmly believes that if they say it, they’ll disappear.”\n Xuan pushed up his spectacles. “From what we know of God’s wipe for the real world, we’ll be killed as soon as we say certain key words. Yet, based on the information I have and the flow of events, Neos died after leaving the information behind. This presents a contradiction. He didn’t get wiped for leaving behind the information, but was instead killed by that member of team Devil. This is different from the wipe we know of. Thus, I have reason to believe that the wipe you all think exists doesn\u0027t actually exist.”\n “Speak slower. We don’t have a brain that works as well as yours.” Zheng rubbed his temples. “You mean that God’s wipe is a lie and we can actually return to the real world without any qualms and do anything we want?”\n “That’s not what I said. If you want to die you can test out that different guess. What I mean is that the possibility of a wipe that they believe in does not exist. It may be false that they’ll be wiped if they say something out.”\n Xuan looked at Luo Yinglong and said. “I want to ask you a question. Have you personally witnessed Adam fighting with enemies before? I mean personally witnessing it. Any enemy would do, whether enemies from the movie world or other teams.”\n “What a joke. Do you think team Celestial is weak? Although we’re few in number, every person was an ex-leader. Even the weakest are of the second stage. There are also various enhancements and self-created skills. Just take me for instance. I’m the only true Cultivator of this realm, right? And my strength…”\n Luo Yinglong had a disposition of not stopping once he started talking. Zheng, who was standing besides him, shook his head, “The main point, the main point!”\n ‘The main point is no. Team Celestial’s strength was enough to complete any of his taskings, assuming they were reasonable of course. So, I haven’t seen him need to take action himself yet… No, wait. It seems that was one time.”\n Just as Luo Yinglong wanted to shake his head in denial, he was suddenly lost in thought, He spoke as he recalled, “In the War of the Dragons movie, we followed his plan to bury nukes… Cough, roughly something like that. He was staying with two of the rear service members outside the city. They unexpectedly ran into several monsters that attacked from underground. When we got the news from the psyche force user, they had already been attacked by the monsters. At that time, I, who had the greatest speed in the team, rushed over.”\n “When I rushed over, those monsters had already died, while the three of them weren’t the slightest bit harmed. The three of them all claimed that one of the rear service members did it, but I’m familiar with that person. He didn’t have such powerful offensive skills, and he wouldn’t be able to let the monster die seemingly without any wounds on its body. If you must know, this is the only time I found it strange.” Luo Yinglong said seriously.\n “Is that so?” Xuan frowned for a long time while Zheng stimulated Honglu to think. It was just that no matter how he thought about it, he couldn’t understand what Xuan meant by that. What did that mean?\n “Zheng let me ask you a question.” Xuan asked after thinking for a while. “If you don’t wants someone to know about your hidden depths, what would you do?”\n “Er. hide it? I’ll conceal everything I don’t want people to know about.” Zheng said without thinking about it.\n “If you want someone to believe some misinformation in order to guide him into doing wrong, what would you do?” Xuan asked again.\n “...Lie. What do these questions have to do with this? This is all simple logic, right?” Zheng asked with a frown as he looked seriously as Xuan. Although he didn’t know how to explain it, he intuitively knew something was strange about Xuan.\n \"If there was a lie that could let people firmly believe it was real, it wouldn’t be a lie… You can take the lie as the truth to a certain extent. In other words, when everyone firmly believes the false is the truth, then it IS the truth in their hearts, even if it doesn’t exist.” Xuan looked at Luo Yinglong. “I believe you all have been tricked by Adam. That restriction where you’ll be killed if you talk about the ruins or the movies does not exist. This, I assert with a fifty to sixty percent confidence.”\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-23-chapter-13-1","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
