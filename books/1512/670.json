{"id":58391,"no":670,"title":"Vol 21 Chapter 4-1","content":"The capital of Alagaesia was actually not far off from the main character’s small village. If one galloped nonstop on horseback, one could reach that small village in about ten hours. In reality, this so-called country was extremely small. At the very least, it was far from comparable to the national size of China in ancient times. If they were to be compared, calling it a prefecture was already being very generous. This country should instead be compared to the national size of medieval European countries, and it would be the size of a duchy even then. The Sky Stick was countless times faster than a horse. Within less than an hour, everyone had reached the capital from the village. It was an imposing city built against a mountain. Although the main buildings of the city weren’t too big, several villages existed at its periphery. These villages also weren’t too large, but it looked like they still had a large population when put together. “Adding together the villages, the markets outside the villages, as well as the people and army troops in the capital, there should be over fifty thousand people. But this location is nicely concentrated. One shot of the Magic Cannon will definitely destroy everything.” Wangxia sat on the Sky Stick, saying as he looked down at the ground from the sky. Zheng sighed. “We don’t need to do it so soon. The young dragon there hasn’t matured yet. As soon as we finish the mission, we’ll return to God’s Realm and our most important goal in this movie world will no longer be achieved. Since we’ve already decided to start the whole plot ourselves, then we’ll handle the mission by not chasing down and killing those who leave the capital. We don’t actually need to kill that many people. At the very least, we don’t need to kill indiscriminately to handle it. If it’s just destroying the capital, we have many ways to do it. For example, Imhotep, you can do it yourself alone. It’s just that you’ll need to spend some time on it.” Imhotep however, had a complicated expression on his face as he looked at the royal palace below. After a long time, he spoke, “It’s not that simple. I can sense some things inside that seem to be stronger than me… Also, it’s a forested, mountainous and snowy area… My magic can’t be displayed to its fullest here. I don’t know if I could destroy it alone.” Hearing this, Zheng rode the Sky Stick to besides Imhotep. Patting Imhotep’s shoulder, he said, “Relax. There’s still us. We’re comrades, how could we possibly let you fight alone? This capital ought to be strong. God definitely wouldn’t give out a movie world that let people farm points as you wished and be carefree. This movie’s difficulty is at least at the team wipe difficulty. Also, according to Xuan’s power formula, what we will face… will definitely not merely be just a single giant dragon.” A team’s strength was based on its members. The stronger each member was, the stronger the team was overall. God’s evaluation of the team’s strength wasn’t only determined by the team members. One, it was through the difficulty of movies completed prior by the team. If a weak team completed an extremely difficult movie, the evaluation of this team would immediately become very high. Secondly, it was decided using the power of the enhancements all the team members exchanged. If you exchanged a very strong enhancement, God’s evaluation of you would rise. But if you created an ability or unlocked the genetic constraint, God’s evaluation wouldn’t rise, as this was your personal power, not something obtained from God. For example, the current Zheng, if solely based on enhancements, would definitely not have too high an evaluation. But his self-created abilities and power were too overly powerful, so he far surpassed the range of God’s evaluation. “So, based on this calculation, this movie may have difficulty, but definitely not one we can’t handle. Moreover, high tech weapons can be used. In other words, even if we can’t win we can use the Magic Cannon to destroy everything. This movie definitely won’t pose a problem for us.” Only when Zheng finished speaking did he deeply exhale. The Xuan besides him suddenly took out a fresh red apple and took a bite of it. Suddenly, he smiled coldly. “A mortal’s wisdom… But you’ve finally improved from idiocy to a mortal’s wisdom? You’ve only spoken of one aspect. Let me ask you, is it only our team who has surpassed our evaluations?” Zheng froze for a while. “Mm, surpassed our evaluations? We should count those who have self-created abilities, even that idiot vampire of team Pacific. Team Celestial, team Devil, and even Neos’s team. What do you mean? Just say it directly. I admit I have a mortal’s wisdom, alright? Xuan didn’t stop smiling coldly and took another bite of the apple. “In other words, the final battle is no longer a question of when. God has no choice but to start the final battle. Do you still not understand? Based on your previous analysis, this movie’s difficulty is actually very high. This capital surely hides power that can wipe an entire team. However, to us who possess the Magic Cannon, even if we don’t use it, you can destroy the whole capital yourself. God’s evaluation no longer holds much use. If things progress like this further, us several teams can just farm points no matter what movie we face. This realm has already lost the purpose it should have. At that time, what thoughts do you think God can think of, but the coming of the final battle! A mortal’s wisdom.” “So what?” Zheng was slightly ashamed into anger. “Mortal wisdom this and mortal wisdom that. Then, you show some Xuan’s wisdom!” Xuan gave a sidelong glance at Zheng. Pushing up his spectacles, he said, “Your third stage stimulation can already let you see the trajectory of some things behind the scenes. So why not ponder over some questions more. I can’t possibly always be by your side. In the future… Anyways, this movie still has some things you’re still not clear about, like its side quests.” “Side quests?” Everyone attached great importance to these two words. After all, these two words represented points and ranked rewards, or perhaps even the existence of certain secret treasures. So, side quests had to be completed when they were discovered. “As you said just now, God wouldn’t give an easy world that let you farm points, nor will it give you a team wipe movie. This difficulty in the middle is defined using God’s evaluation you mentioned just now. Us of team China definitely won’t have too high an evaluation. At least for Independence Day we didn’t destroy the alien headquarters but relied on the Guide to complete the movie. And with the rating deduction from the previous leader death, our evaluation should at a high ranked team, but definitely incomparable to team Celestial and team Devil. Based on the principle that God won’t give a team wipe mission, the capital massacre mission must have a side quest!” Zheng suddenly had a bad premonition. He curiously asked, “What kind of side quest? It’s massacring the capital anyways. Don’t tell me there will be some kind of helper assisting us? “There is. For example, letting those who leave the capital become free men who don’t need to be chased down by us. This way, we can then complete God’s mission within three days.” Xuan ate the apple as if nothing had happened. The mission God gave was to massacre all living things in the capital within three days. But these words instead easily created some ambiguity. First was to massacre all living things in the capital, with those that leave the capital not included. Second was to massacre all living things in the capital, with those that leave to be chased down. Based on these two meanings, different endings and methods of handling it could be created, which was exactly what Zheng was worried about. “You… Didn’t you say both situations was possible? I decided to take the bet because I heard your suggestion!” Zheng finally understood what that bad premonition was. “Er, I lied to you.” Xuan bit into his apple as if nothing had happened. “... Don’t hold me back! Wangxia and Imhotep, scram! I’m going to kill this idiot!” The disturbance in the sky didn’t arouse anyone’s attention. In this world, few could fly in the sky. Apart from Dragon Riders, there were only magic users, but they wouldn’t be as bored as to fly ten thousand metres into the sky to fight. “The basic situation is like that. From God’s wording, God wants the massacre of all living things in the capital. If the living things in the capital are too many, but their individual strength isn’t high, then it could be just a massacre of all living things in the capital, with those that leave the capital not included. But if the living things in the capital aren’t many, but their individual strength is high, or if a certain few have great strength, then it’ll definitely be the other possibility. As long as these living things were once inside the capital, then we’ll have to chase them to the end no matter how far they go in order to complete this mission!” Xuan rubbed his slightly swelled up face. Zheng frowned. “Why? Is there some difference? It should be all the living things WITHIN the capital, right?” “The scope of battle!” Xuan coldly laughed. “How much activity do you think is needed to kill a weak living thing such as normal humans or the gnomes in European fantasy movies? With a technological weapon, a single bullet is enough! But how much activity would there be if it’s a giant dragon, giants, or the Ringwraiths and Balrogs we met back in Lord of the Rings? It’s possible to go out from inside and end up killing them outside. If it’s a hundred metres long giant dragon? A single flight will be kilometres away. Do you think this would still count as within the capital, or outside? So, when Imhotep felt that there were organisms below stronger than him… God’s mission was ascertained. All the living things inside need to be killed. Any that runs out needs to be chased down and killed, until all living things are dead. Unless… we become aware of the sole opportunity for life that God left inside, which is also the side quest I referred to!” “In the original movie, the princess, who in order to steal the dragon egg, was captured by the magician sent by the king… If it’s her rallying, how many civilians and soldiers will leave with her? If my deduction is correct, saving her is the single path of survival God gave. At that time she will rally them to leave the capital, and those that leave the capital won’t need to be chased down and killed by us. At that time, our enemies will only be those living things left defending the capital… as well as the giant dragon of the king!” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-21-chapter-4-1","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
