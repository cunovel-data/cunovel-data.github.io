{"id":58302,"no":581,"title":"Vol 19 Chapter 6-6","content":"The tactical nukes by themselves possessed enormous force. The Demon Energy’s enhancement further raised them to a force to be reckoned with, both for a modern army and for player teams. A WangXia with Demon Energy and high explosive bombs had the power to pose a threat to Zheng.\n The harbor was almost completely destroyed after the explosions. The tens of meters high tidal waves crushed the smaller ships to ashes. As the people who stood nearest to the ocean, team China and the influential leaders were exposed under the gigantic tidal wave.\n Xuan slid his fingers across his glasses when the tidal waves and ruins of ships were under twenty meters away. Such a short distance shouldn’t take the waves more than a second to consume the people at their approaching speed. Everyone opened their mouths and screamed soundlessly. They had lost the ability to utter any sounds.\n Dong~! The waves crashed into a unique colored glowing barrier in front of Xuan. It was a wrecked ship that collided with the barrier.\n (I can block it! I can block it!)\n The glasses’ hypnosis activated and brought Xuan into the perfect state to utilize the Lambda Driver. The Lambda driver then activated with his thought. The power of faith turned into a barrier and separated everyone from the tidal waves. It was the ultimate shield given the toughness it displayed. The waves and wrecked ships crashing into the barrier did not even manage to reduce the barrier’s intensity. Everything crumpled upon touching the barrier, including huge rocks and steel. There was obviously more to the barrier than its defensive power.\n The waves came and went fast. The people were standing some slight distance away from the ocean and on a raised platform so the flood did not get to their height. Once the initial waves subsided, the rest only could reach less and less distance from the ocean and eventually all the waves returned to the ocean. With the tidal waves gone, the people finally got to see the ruins left behind. Beyond the harbor were the mushroom clouds still roiling. Huge quantity of water were vaporized, resulting in a layer of fog on the ocean. The wind blowing from the ocean was still hot but everyone could was frozen with their eyes and mouths wide open. Their minds stopped at the moment the Japanese navy were destroyed.\n “This is the destructive power of a tiny piece of the Buddha statue. The rest of the Buddha will explode in the same manner after six days. The chain reaction from all explosions will multiply their destructiveness over ten thousand folds and bring the world to an end.” Xuan massaged his determined eyes that were a result of the hypnosis then said to the people.\n WangXia descended with the Sky Stick. Using Demon Energy on three tactical nukes at the same time nearly drained him of all energy. Fortunately, his physical fitness allowed him to remain standing. Though he was not any stronger than a normal person at this point.\n Xuan stepped in front of WangXia casually and said to the rest of the people here, “Tell me of your decision from the choices I have given you — Give me the information systems you have to find the Buddha statue or I will kill you now, or wait for the destruction of the world after six days.”\n Xuan’s words shocked these people awake. They looked to each other with unbelievable expressions. A mafia leader scratched his head and said, “Is this some short of illusion? It looks realistic but if you want to use all of Qingbang’s informants with just this…”\n A light glided across his neck horizontally before he could finish talking. His head flew up two meters. Blood spurted from the neck as his head came back down and splattered the people near him. Their minds went blank for several seconds before the terror struck.\n Xuan looked at them calmly. “This isn’t a request nor demand. This is an order. I don’t know if you have heard of complete authority, which is what I am doing. Cooperate with me if you wish to live. I will reward you appropriately afterward. Refuse and your life, the power you represent, and your family will disappear… I will ask once more. Do you want to cooperate with the information systems in your hands?”\n Complete authority was using the advantage of high standing and power to bully other people. Just as Xuan had said, when strength exceeded a limit, they could take actions without consideration of the situation.\n “… That’s the situation if my deduction from emulating HongLu is correct. Xuan can only use this tactic to find the Buddha statue. We have too little time, only six days. We aren’t in the twenty first century where information is explosive across the globe. Communication and transportation are limiting factors here. In order to investigate all the major powers in six days, we will need the Sky Sticks and huge sources of information. Without the information, we won’t know where the enemies lie no matter how fast we can fly. It would be nothing short of committing suicide, right?” Zheng sat on a boulder and twirled the hair in front of his forehead.\n The second night since receiving the mission had fallen. Zheng’s party still hadn’t received another message from Xuan this whole day. The other end was quiet as a rock that sank to the bottom of the ocean. Slowly but surely, a hint of panic brewed within TengYi and LiuYu. But as Zheng deduced their situation through the third stage, the two gradually calmed down.\n “Speaking of which,” LiuYu suddenly laughed. “That’s the situation. Isn’t that Xuan’s line? When did you begin to copy him? Or were you emulating him instead?”\n Zheng smiled with a sigh. “I want to emulate his thinking process but unfortunately, I still can’t do it after reaching mid-fourth stage. It’s incredibly strange if you think about it. I can’t figure out why… Perhaps his way of thinking isn’t even human. Only psychopaths could think like that. I suppose if normal people like us try to emulate him, we will turn into men with three -less traits.”\n “Three less traits?” LiuYu asked curiously.\n “Expressionless, wordless, emotionless. That’s the state of Xuan. Haha.” Zheng laughed.\n They joked for a bit then Zheng turned to Imhotep. “Have you decided to come with us to God’s dimension? If you did then I will go back to exchange the bracelet after this event. That can bring the two of you to God’s dimension.”\n The only non players here were Imhotep and Anck-Su-Namun. No one knew where Jonathan went off to.\n Imhotep replied, “If this tomb does not have the elixir of immortality, we will go with you to God’s dimension. However, I have one last question. Will it be dangerous to Anck-Su-Namun?”\n Zheng exhaled and pondered for a moment. “Danger is proportional to gain. The more danger it is the more gain accompanies it. You might be able to live thousands of years but she’s a normal human. Age and diseases will follow her life. The only guarantee I can make to you is God’s realm has the elixir of immortality. At the same time, it’s extremely dangerous, both to her, to you, and me. I won’t lie to you but even with my strength, I could die in some movie all of a sudden. So you have to think through it carefully.”\n Imhotep hesitated. He stared at the gorgeous woman sitting next to him with such intense and serious expression. Time slowly passed without him taking his eyes away. Finally, the lust that he saw on her face brought his head to a nod. “If this tomb does not have the elixir of immortality, we will go with you to God’s dimension… I have a little wish. Please protect her as much as you can. Protect her until she becomes as strong as you. Can you?”\n Zheng nodded. “Of course. You will be our comrade once you joined team China. Just don’t betray the team and I will do my best to protect you. Welcome to team China.”\n Imhotep smiled and was about to speak when he heard a blood-curling scream echoed from the distance. That was Jonathan’s voice. Shortly after, they saw him running out from behind the trees and crying, “Run! The Yellow Turbans have revived!”\n Five huge monsters followed him out from the trees. Their bodies were one size bigger than the last time they met in Shanghai. The monsters grew again.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-6-06","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
