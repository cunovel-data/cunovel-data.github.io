{"id":58386,"no":665,"title":"Vol 21 Chapter 2-1","content":"About five days had passed since the return from Independence Day to God’s Realm. In this time everyone had already rested completely apart from the newbies who had just entered the movie worlds. Even the Eragon plot and countermeasures had already been planned. Everyone wasn’t too worried about the next movie world, as there was no team battle, and was likely to be one of the rare easy movies that God gave. What really made them worried was the deduction that Honglu made.\n Was the final battle nearing? Had team China completed their preparations?\n Perhaps Zheng had already done his preparations to welcome the the final battle from his power to understanding, and from his mentality to plans. But what about the rest of team China? Including Xuan, everyone more or less had this type of question. If it wasn’t not being powerful enough, then it was an incorrect mental state, or just being in the sleeping state. In any case, challenging team Devil, that man known as as the strongest in the realm, Xuan’s clone as well a whole group of terrifying clones in this imperfect state… Could they really do it?\n “This already isn’t up to us about whether we’re can do it or not. Since God has already arranged that the final battle is nearing, instead of wondering whether we can do it, we should instead think about how to live on, and how to beat the other teams.” Zheng spoke to the team members before him, looking at Xuan. That man was currently calculating something out in a journal, his face filled with fanaticism...\n Normally, Xuan being in this state was unusual and infrequent. For this man who lacked emotions or the senses, his thirst for knowledge was his only desire. At present, those secret Cultivation manuals were the unknown articles that he wanted to analyse and decipher the most. So in the past two days, this man had been maintaining this fanatical look, which only made the other’s hair stand on end. Everyone felt that, if possible, that cold as ice expression of his was actually not that bad.\n (Is this fellow really listening? I told him yesterday to think of a way to raise everyone’s morale. Today I’m the one instead giving a speech… I really want to give this guy a violent beating!)\n Zheng wanted to find a way to raise everyone’s morale, because the majority of the team members before him had low morale. Thus, he found Honglu to discuss this issue. The root cause they found was that the overall power of the team was insufficient. If they could get some breakthrough in power from Xuan, then their morale would naturally be able to suddenly rise. Otherwise, team China’s morale would likely not have much change until the final battle.\n Without any alternative, Zheng could only enter that dangerous room of Xuan. He then entered the even more dangerous underground testing room to find Xuan and discuss a solution.\n His luck this time was good however. Xuan happened to come out from his room to exchange something from God, and Zheng hastily grabbed him. He hurriedly asked him questions for a period of time, and told all the things he was considering to that man.\n “...The basic situation is like that. For now, let’s not discuss whether we have completed the preparations for the final battle, and whether Honglu’s deduction is correct. I feel like the current state of team China won’t do. If we persistently keep testing them on the situation during the final battle, we’ll instead restrict their power…” Zheng spoke about all his misgivings.\n Xuan laughed coldly as he said, “This is your responsibility as leader. You can’t keep asking me to scheme and plan, then think of methods to create equipment, then think of methods to obtain Cultivation techniques AND then think of methods to comfort those team members. What do you take me for?”\n “Doraemon…”\n “In short, team Devil is just a team. You really wasted the A Nightmare on Elm Street movie world, if you really can’t pass even this kind of obstacle because of a single team wipe and because you take all those rumours as legend.”\n Having finished speaking, Xuan turned around to walk back to his room. Behind him, Zheng was already shouting about what he was going to say for the next day’s speech.\n In the end, the only one who truly thought of a method on the second day was still Zheng. That bastard, Xuan, had a fanatical expression on his face as he researched from the time he appeared to now. This strange him had made the surrounding people instinctively stay ten metres away from him. It wasn’t that he was definitely dangerous, but that their instincts made them feel that being beside him was a type of danger in itself.\n Zheng got angrier the more he looked at this. Finally, he wasn’t able to help but start shouting. “Xuan! You should say something whatever the case, alright? And don’t keep showing that fanatical expression. Don’t you feel like you’re scaring people?”\n Hearing that, Xuan rubbed his facial expression. The rubbed face suddenly changed from one of fanaticism to one of cool indifference. This process made everyone sweat profusely, while he nonchalantly spoke. “Do you all feel team Devil is easy to deal with? How is team Celestial compared to them?”\n Zheng opened his mouth as he wanted to speak. Xuan shook his head at him strangely, then that man turned to the other members of team China. Everyone else had gone silent as they thought about it, with only Honglu shaking his head. “I’ve never clashed with team Celestial before, so I don’t know their special characteristics and team composition. I only heard that they have the sole true Cultivator among all the teams, right? His strength seems to be stronger than Zheng using Destruction. He also doesn\u0027t seem to be the strongest in the team, which means the power of the team shouldn’t be weak.”\n “It’s not just not bad.” Zero suddenly broke the silence. He nodded. “Accurately speaking, they are extremely strong. If we clash directly with them, given our strength, it would end in a team wipe. If our luck is good, it may be a pyrrhic victory.... If not for Xuan, there would definitely have been casualties in our team!”\n In actual fact, the one most likely to die was Zheng. If not for Xuan’s schemes and arrangements, Zheng would definitely have died!\n The rest secretly nodded. Only Xuan shook his head. “Do you know why team Celestial cannot contend with team Devil? It is because team Devil has an unsurpassable apex. From the information we know, clone Zheng once challenged team Celestial alone and obtained victory. Although we don’t know whether it was a pyrrhic victory, but this piece of news is enough. He is someone whom no one can match!” \n “Then…” Xuan spoke to Zheng again. “If we don’t talk about Chaos, Genesis Splitter, and we rate your power as 100 during Lord of the Rings, how much has your strength risen since, after breaking through to the mid fourth stage?”\n “Hmm…” Zheng considered it. “It should be rated as about 300 to 500. After overcoming the heart’s devil, my strength increased by a great amount. Even without Chaos, Genesis Splitter, my strength has still increased by three to five times. If I battle with Luo Yinglong with his strength at that time, I definitely won’t lose. No, it should be that I will kill him after giving him light to serious wounds!”\n “That’s right!” Xuan snapped his fingers. “You all have always had a misconception. Whether a team is strong or weak is indeed looked at using the overall team strength. For example, it needs a psyche force user, a long range sniper, someone with large scale firepower, melee combatants and the team’s brains. These are all completely necessary. If both sides have all these members, then what will decide the survival of the team will be how much their actual power is… Let me make a comparison, team Devil’s power is 5500, and clone Zheng takes up 5000 of this. This is a table I made based on the information we have. There are other teams we have faced inside…”\n Xuan took a table from a pile of documents. Inside was team Forest, team Pacific, team India, team Celestial and team Devil… this series had all the teams team China had faced before inside. Team Devil ranked first, and indeed had the number 5500. The known team Devil members were all recorded inside, and solely clone Zheng took up 5000 of this rating.\n “Is there something wrong with this table? Why is team Celestial’s rating lower than us? It’s only 2100, while we are at 3700. That fellow, Zheng, is 3000 himself? It’s not possible.” Cheng Xiao had a strange expression on his face, speaking as he looked at it. Everyone else’s eyes were filled with doubt.\n Xuan laughed coldly instead. “Nothing is impossible. This table refers to when the team is whole, and doesn’t include those who were raised like cattle. With the condition that both teams are fully gathered, then what the two sides will compete in are schemes and power. If their schemes are equal, then they will compete in power and conviction. Based on my information, if team Devil all dies out and only clone Zheng is left alive, team Devil will not be wiped. His power has already exceeded the level of schemes and the constraints of the environment. Thus, his 5000 rating is enough to challenge a powerful team…”\n “Then Zheng. That’s not much to say. After overcoming the heart’s devil, your power approaches that of your clone. You still lack something however… I’ll go into that later. I’ll only say that your current strength isn’t on the same level as your clone. At least, when you use Chaos, Genesis Splitter, you can decimate team Celestial, but you will die in the end. So, after you obtained Chaos, Genesis Splitter, I gave you a rating of 3000. As for team Celestial’s power, I based it on Lord of the Rings. Unless Luo Yinglong in their team continued to rise in power, they won’t be able to go against us of team China and team Devil…”\n “Next is the crux of the matter. If team Devil is just based on the power of their ordinary members, they actually won\u0027t surpass us by much. The truly terrifying one is that man who stands at the apex of power in the entire realm… If we can kill him? If we kill that man, team Devil isn’t some insurmountable obstacle! That is why, my plan for the final battle is… a battle of kings! King versus King!” \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-21-chapter-2-1","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
