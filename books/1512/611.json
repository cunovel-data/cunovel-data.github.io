Is this going to be okay?” Heng frowned.\\n\\n Team China was standing on the deck of a ship. The Magic Cannon was secured into four small holes. Once the ship adjusted its position, the Magic Cannon would face the Pacific coast of the United States. At that point, all the team needed to do was fill the cannon with energy stones and then boom! It would put a dent on the map of the United States.\\n\\n ChengXiao patted Heng’s shoulder without waiting for Xuan’s reply. “Relax. See the cannon balls? They are still far from us. Do you think they can reach us in a short period of time? You will lose your sense of reasoning when you care too much, which is how you are right now. Girls dislike this type of people.” He pointed at YanWei who was leaning her feeble body against the wall. The long flight had taken a toll on her but her fortitude kept her standing, clenching her teeth. She didn’t utter a word of complain the whole way.\\n\\n Heng blushed. He was indeed worried about YanWei. He and the other team members wouldn’t be concerned of mere warships and cannons. Their power had reached a level where they could overlook such threats. YanWei was different. Her strength was not much different from a normal person who had just entered the realm. A shot on the ship they were standing on would probably impact her.\\n\\n She gave a him cold smile then turned to look at the Magic Cannon.\\n\\n The cannon was as weird looking as it had always been. The dissonant horse legs and the sci-fi cannon on top of the horse legs were so unseemly. Yet, who would have known this was a weapon capable of destroying the world?\\n\\n Xuan filled the cannon with energy stones then touched his glasses. He looked through the glasses at the silhouette of the continent that was still far away.\\n\\n WangXia joked. “Did you completely overhauled the glasses? Can they mark enemy locations and power levels like the ones from sci-fi movies?”\\n\\n “Uh… yes.”\\n\\n “... Uh? Yes? What the heck are you kidding?” ChengXiao yelled in shock. “Who do you think you are to modify the glasses to this extend? The real Doraemon?”\\n\\n Xuan ignored him as he pressed the buttons on the Magic Cannon. Several seconds later, he looked to the other members and said. “Let’s start.”\\n\\n “Message from the United States two hours ago. The land spanning from east of San Francisco to the border of Nevada has sunk into the Pacific Ocean. The impact has reached Mount Jefferson. An initial estimate of millions of deaths.”\\n\\n Zheng received the message from Kuomintang. Once he learned that the Kuomintang officials had a piece of the silver plate, he contacted them before long. He had scruples knowing Xuan was heading to the United States. By the time he received the message, the map of the United States had already be redrawn. Strangely, the second part of the message mentioned the group split up, heading to different directions. Xuan continued advancing inward to the United States. WangXia went south to South America. ChengXiao flew toward Europe. And Heng was going to the Soviet Union. There was only one Magic Cannon that he knew of. Could Xuan had created a second one? Yet, the team only had a single One Ring.\\n\\n “Anyway. It’s clear we have become the role models for the demons of this world. No worse beings ever existed in human history. Some races massacred tens of millions but no one ever erased a piece of land from the map. We are the exception in history.” Zheng said with a bitter laughter.\\n\\n Zero, YinKong, TengYi, LiuYu, Imhotep, Anck-Su-Namu, and Jonathan sat in front of him.\\n\\n Zero was fighting a difficult battle when he woke up. He protected the group for the past few days using his long range snipes. The Yellow Turbans were such marvelous beings, their power grew more than double during this period and their speed exceeded how fast Zero could kill them before they approached him. Zero was kiting using the burst speed of the Sky Stick and sniping without scope, and saved the group a few times.\\n\\n However, the last fight was going to be the end if Zheng didn’t wake up. The Yellow Turbans blinked faster than the Sky Stick could fly away. Zero had to rely on instincts under the unlocked mode to survive the attacks. Though the Yellow Turbans still seemed fragile when faced against Zheng. He easily destroyed them.\\n\\n YinKong also woke up at the same time as him. She was still the quiet girl with an ice cold face that they had known. She didn’t change. Zheng was the only one who knew of what happened in her past. The battle on the island was the worst nightmare she experienced. Her dearest sister, the boy she loved, and the comrades who grew up with her were taken away in that battle, leaving behind only a scar in her heart and an ego that had died.\\n\\n The YinKong that was strong enough to rival Zheng, the most talented assassin had gone. She couldn’t bear nor accept the pain and regrets of what happened. When RuiKong erased her memory and sealed her strength in the final moment of her life, this YinKong also fell into a deep sleep. What became of the new YinKong was a second ego, a cold girl who was in search of comrades.\\n\\n (So the original ego can’t come out. Why do I have a feeling that she’s escaping? These glasses can allow her to come out for five minutes. It will take one to two years before the two egos fuse into one… I think she’s trying to end it all with ZhuiKong and then leave this world in peace. Has she lost the reason to live?)\\n\\n Zheng sighed. He gaze toward YinKong suddenly felt gentle. When she noticed Zheng looking at her, she blushed and turned her head to the side.\\n\\n “Zheng?” Zero’s voice interrupted Zheng’s thoughts.\\n\\n Zheng clapped his face then said. “What’s it?”\\n\\n Zero continued. “I am asking what level are you at right now? I am well aware of the Yellow Turban’s strength but you still slashed through two of them in one hit. I wish to know how strong you are right now.”\\n\\n “Uh.” Zheng pondered for a moment. “It’s difficult to answer this question. The truth is Tiger’s Soul counters the Yellow Turbans. Though I believe I should be able to easily take them down in a direct fight.”\\n\\n Zheng touched his own face. “My strength has reached a similar level to my clone. This is only my speculation since I don’t know how far my clone has gotten. Secondly, we haven’t encountered a situation where I have to use my full strength. So I don’t even know my limit. I am confident though that if we were to meet the same team Celestial as the one in the Lord of the Rings, I can wipe them by myself as long as Xuan can keep up with Adam in strategy.”\\n\\n “Oh.” Zero was as calm as always.\\n\\n “Ohhh!” TengYi cried. Even YinKong glanced at him multiple times. LiuYu looked confused as he didn’t know what it meant. Given Zheng’s personality, the statement wouldn’t be far from the truth.\\n\\n “Just that… when I think deeper, I think I am still not as strong as my clone.” Zheng smiled bitterly. “My techniques are all throwing my life on the line. Explosion, Destruction, Dragon Transformation, and even the one I am hypothesizing is the same way. My clone’s techniques take a different path. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to hold back when they battled team Celestial. I can’t do the same. It’s either I kill them all or I die. There’s still a gap between us.”\\n\\n The silver plate signaled incoming message. Zheng immediately unfolded it. His expression took a roller coaster and in the end, he looked thrilled.\\n\\n “The final piece is found. The Soviet Union has it.”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-13-07","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
