{"id":58315,"no":594,"title":"Vol 19 Chapter 10-3","content":"WangXia participated in the battle against the Japanese army outside Japan and annihilated Japanese ships with tactical nukes so he had a decent idea of his own strength. In contrast to Heng and ChengXiao, his power was meant for group battles. Demon Energy wasn’t effective on its own as bombs materialized by Demon Energy had limited destructiveness, unlike plasma bombs and tactical nukes which could have a coverage of thousands of meters. His power came from manipulating high-tech bombs using Demon Energy, powerful but considered a sci-fi attack. As a result, anyone in team China wearing the Dragonshard Necklace could easily take him down after they defended the first wave of attack from WangXia. His attacks were large AOEs but impotent on single target focused fights. WangXia was fond of reading fantasy novels. He used to imagine himself as an invincible hero who could save the world. It was the reason he asked Zheng to teach him Qi. The outcome wasn’t desireable but he gained a sense of becoming stronger. Eventually, he obtained hi-explosive bombs, gravity bombs, plasma bombs, and tactical nukes. These bombs he had access to became more and more powerful. His Demon Energy also granted him new ways to utilize the bombs as his enhancement ranked up. WangXia’s growth was linked to team China. The stronger team China became, the stronger he would be because only as a team could they obtain access to more and more powerful bombs. WangXia was rather forthright as a person and he entered God’s realm as a soldier with hot blood. His motive was the purest and most noble among all others who entered the realm. Everyone else either gave up on life or the real world, or came to seize the treasures of the realm after learning of its existence. WangXia came to fulfill his responsibility as a soldier and had retained the conduct of a soldier… ChengXiao was an exception. Xuan was also an exception given his indifferent personality. (Well then… let’s begin!) WangXia looked down at the fleet below. He recalled the details of the mission Xuan explained to him. His priority was to obtain the Buddha statue piece. Otherwise, attacking the fleet could sink the statue piece into the ocean along with the ships. Therefore, WangXia had to sneak into the fleet and control someone who was aware of the location of the statue piece. This person should be a high ranking officer. The method he would use to control a person was device Xuan used on Haotian. The device didn’t break after they killed Haotian. Seeing the effectiveness of the device, Xuan crafted two more afterward. If it weren’t for the resources team China seized from team Celestial, Xuan wouldn’t have been able to craft the extras given how expensive the device cost. The target wearing the device would become a slave to the person holding the control. Haotian possessed Nen but he was unable to resist before his death. Xuan handed a device to WangXia before he departed for the fleet and informed him another way to use the device. He could knock out the target then put the device on to bypass the need for the target to willingly put it on. He recalled a joke about a dealer who sold rat poison. The dealer boasted how effective his rat poison was. Then people asked how to use the poison and he replied you would catch the rat then stuff the poison into its mouth. There was no way for the rat to survive. The direction for the device sounded similar to the dealer’s method. WangXia left Shanghai immediately after he received the order. He contacted Xuan twice on the way but he didn’t question much. His mind was occupied with completing the mission. The Sky Stick descended quietly in the dark sky. It was the most tiring time of the day for a person. WangXia sneaked into a carrier without encountering any trouble. He sneaked behind a guard, knocked him out, then put the device on his head. The guard told everything he knew about the high ranking officers and their locations in this ship. WangXia accompanied the guard to a cabin where one of the high ranking officer resided. “I am sorry. We are both soldiers.” WangXia placed his hand on the back of the guard’s head. A small boom followed as the guard’s neck was blasted. The device fell onto a pool of blood, still intact. WangXia sighed. He picked up the device without a moment of hesitation then walked to the cabin door. He entered the unlocked mode during this short walk. Even though he was only at the first stage, the unlocked mode gave him much better control over his Demon Energy. He placed his hands on the door and it fell forward after a small explosion. The Demon Energy materialized bomb blasted the door without any difficulty. WangXia was careful to not cause too much noise up to this point because it could hinder him from capturing a high ranking officer. Now that he found a target, he didn’t have to worry anymore. All he needed to do was follow Xuan’s order of brute forcing through the mission! Behind the door was a standard officer cabin with few furnitures and a single bed. A man immediately sat up from the bed when WangXia barged in. However, WangXia punched him unconscious before he could utter a sound. WangXia carefully put the device on the officer then filled a pot of cold water from the bathroom. He poured the water on the officer’s face, waking him up. The officer jumped at once but the confused looked on his face indicated he was not completely awake. “Tell me, where is the Buddha statue piece you got from the Chinese government?” Holding on the control, WangXia asked in a low voice. A brief confusion later, panic filled the officer’s face as he tried to yell. Yet, the words that came out told the location of the Buddha statue. It was placed in a safe in a concealed room at the lower level of the carrier. The room required a passcode to access. WangXia asked, “Do you have the passcode to the room? What will happen if someone breaks into the room with force? Will it destroy the things inside?” The officer replied without emotions, “Why would we destroy the things inside? The room is sealed by steel walls. It was built as a safe for gold so we wouldn’t destroy the gold inside. The only way you can break into the room without a passcode is by using artillery.” WangXia realized they were in 1940 where the modern anti-theft systems did not exist. The best anti-theft systems in this era were basically consisted of a passcode lock and tough walls. He was over thinking when he took into account the ways people used to protect classified items in the future. There wasn’t anything left to worry after recognizing the lack of risk from obtaining the Buddha statue. WangXia lifted the officer off the bed, asked for the specific location of the room, then took out the Sky Stick. His Demon Energy excited as he stepped onto the Sky Stick. Several plasma bombs under the Demon Energy’s effect surfaced around him. The officer was shocked to see the floating bombs. WangXia held up his hand then a bomb flew out to the corridor. An intense light flashed. Heated air blew against their faces. The plasma bomb burned a hole through the floor and ceiling.
