{"id":58380,"no":659,"title":"Vol 20 Chapter 15-3","content":"The scene changed over to that of the other side a few minutes ago. Zheng and Julian confronted each other. Although Julian had already sealed off Zheng’s three most important senses in battle amongst the five senses, he still seemed unwilling to get nearer to Zheng. Because although it was only just Zheng standing there quietly, his power was already sufficient to make Julian unwilling to face it. Even with the protection of the sheath, facing Zheng was simply too dangerous. (His strength and speed have already reached the limits of an ordinary organism’s body. Assuming he was that traitor Cultivator of team Celestial that would still be slightly better. But he’s not. To reach this level relying only on the body is truly… unimaginable.) Julian stood at his original position rubbing his injuries. He shook his head, laughing bitterly, before pondering inwardly again. (I made the same mistake as Lionheart. I underestimated the power of team China’s leader. Although I still haven’t used the Arayashiki, it’s still unknown if it can have any use against someone who overcame the heart’s devil. I definitely can’t let any other members of team China come over at this time, or else I can only flee…) Julian immediately laughed bitterly again. Originally, he had wanted to let the other members of team China rush over. But based on the current situation, they wouldn’t rush over to be killed, but instead surround him. That situation definitely couldn’t be permitted to happen. Also, Lionheart on the other side seemed to have absorbed the power of two of team China. To avoid him continuing to become even more powerful, Julian had no choice but to change his original objective and planned to use psyche force to draw the remaining members of team China over to Lionheart. To send a made-up situation, especially through the method of a psyche force scan to send it to the remaining people, was of course of no difficulty to Julian with his high level of psyche force. After easily sending out the fake scene, he then lured Honglu and the rest to where Lionheart was. It was just that they were very far from where the pair of Wangxia was, and they would be late by several minutes even if they rushed over... When this was done, Julian finally put all his focus on Zheng. Until now, this man was quietly standing there, as if he was a normal person who had lost his sight, touch and hearing. No, strictly speaking apart from his calmness being unlike normal people, all other aspects seemed to be like a normal person, and he just stood there unmoving. (Something’s wrong. He’s too overly quiet… Whatever the case he’s still Zheng Zha. Was he so easily made useless with his three senses sealed? I have some uneasiness in my heart…) Julian inhaled deeply. He slowly walked towards Zheng, walking straight until he reached about twenty metres from him before stopping. Julian then waved his hand, and that middle-aged Caucasian walked towards Zheng without even thinking about it. At the same time that sheath in his hand released a faint white light. That middle-aged Caucasian walked until he was ten metres away from Zheng. But just as he was about to take another step, a pressure that was dangerous to the utmost directly attacked. Zheng who was originally standing there quietly abruptly turned around to face him. It could only be seen that Zheng lightly kicked out. An invisible wind blade sliced towards that middle-aged Caucasian. This was Zheng’s ‘Rankyaku’ of the six styles. Although its strength wasn’t considered to be too great, its attack speed was first rate. Before the middle-aged Caucasian had recovered from his shock, that wind blade had already sliced at the white light surrounding half a metre around his body. This white light had real toughness and durability. Even though it collided with the white light all of a sudden, the white light actually didn’t seem to be exhausted in the slightest, and that middle-aged Caucasian had been knocked back over ten metres by the force of the wind blade. Even though the white light had blocked the might of the wind blade, it couldn’t completely offset the force of that strike. It was clear that the power of that wind blade was very great. (He can sense it? Why? Without sight or hearing, he simply shouldn’t be able to see or hear anything in his surroundings. Similarly, even his sense of touch has been sealed. He can’t even feel the flow of the wind… the sixth sense? Even though the higher the genetic constraint unlocked, the higher the chances of the triggering of instincts and the sixth sense, those two feelings aren’t standard sensory organs. There’s an element of luck to them. He can’t just suddenly explode when you get ten metres near him. That attack just now definitely had had energy being stored for very long. Unless there’s internal sensory organs? Psyche force scanning?) Julian wasn’t a boor. Upon seeing that Zheng had preparations, he didn’t intend to immediately attack. In any case his Ring of Heaven’s Treasure could seal the senses for at least over ten minutes. Even if Zheng broke out of the sealing, he would at least not be in any danger. With Avalon, the Everdistant Utopia, he could be at ease as he fearlessly searched for an opportunity to completely defeat Zheng. (It’s not psyche force. I can’t sense any leaking of his psyche force. But that’s of course. No matter how strong he is, first of all he’s not a psyche force user. Secondly, he didn’t go to the deep layers of the consciousness while overcoming the heart’s devil, so of course he can’t use psyche force to fight… In that case, it seems that his battle style has always been to use his body? It’s just that when a body is strong to a certain level, they no longer belong to those who use energy to battle. (Note: This seems contextually wrong, or am I misinterpreting this sentence? Considering the next sentence as well, shouldn’t it be that people of a certain body strength use energy to battle?) That’s right. Simply relying on the stamina stored in the body isn’t enough to sustain that intensive consumption of his. He definitely has energy enhancements, only that I don’t know whether it’s only Blood Energy…) Julian thought about it. Then he directly picked up a piece of metal block of rubble the size of a hand from the ground. He casually threw it at Zheng. That metal block suffered an attack when it was ten metres from Zheng. All that could be seen was him suddenly turning around, and his fist punching out. The speed of the fist was difficult to catch with the naked eye, and the wind from the punch easily reduced the metal block to dust, and all the metal fragments were all sent flying at Julian. Julian stood at his position unmoving. He allowed the white light to flash past and block the attack. Only then did he slightly frown. He had actually placed a psyche force imprint on the metal block just now. This psyche force imprint was also a type of energy, formed from psyche force. It was an ability he used specially to test out the energy enhancements of others. And in the test just now, he had indeed discovered the existence of a strange energy around Zheng. The most important part was that it possessed a strong energy corrosion property. Within an instant, his psyche force imprint had actually become completely corroded. It seemed that Zheng was indeed relying on this energy to sense his surroundings. Zheng was indeed using energy to sense his surroundings. This was an ability he had discovered in the past. For example, when Qi and Blood Energy were released outside of the body, they could be used to scan the surroundings. It was only that the energy had the characteristics of dissipating faster the further it was from the body. Even with the energy storage mithril rings, he couldn’t squander energy this way. Thus, after he made a few tests, he changed the energy source of this type of technique to Refined Qi and Magic. Refined Qi and Magic were the products of the condensation of Qi and Blood Energy. Once these two energies were formed, it usually wouldn’t dissipate by itself unless it was used up completely or depleted completely. It was the same even if it left the body, as if the energy had condensed into matter. Otherwise, the Refined Qi and Magic on cultivation treasures couldn’t have lasted the passage of countless years intact. Zheng himself didn’t have any Cultivation techniques or Magic techniques. He was also unable to use these two powerful energies as the foundational energies for battle. In accordance with the principles of making use of wasted materials, after several tests he discover of method of usage. The purpose was only to use it as an energy probe. (It’s truly lucky. I just wanted to test it for fun at that time. I didn’t expect it would actually save my life at this time.…) Zheng secretly considered nonstop. After being deprived of the three senses, the most important senses to him as a combatant were completely gone. The remaining taste and smell were basically unrelated to battle for him. At the very least he hadn’t learnt to rely on on his taste to distinguish and seek out his opponents. In this situation, although it was only a bit of Magic spread out over an area of ten metres, this was more than enough for him. “It’s really unimaginable. This ability to seal the five senses is actually this scary…” Zheng silently sighed. He then appeared within an instant not far from where Julian was. He punched out with several fists that couldn’t be caught with the naked eye. Although the white light of the sheath blocked the destructive power of these punches, but the force of the punches still sent Julian flying far off, crashing to the ground over ten metres away. But Zheng didn’t even pause, vanishing in a flash again. However, the direction he headed in was wrong this time, and he directly crashed into a wall over ten metres away from Julian, actually leaving a human shaped impression in the wall. Julian was flabbergasted seeing this. Only when Zheng came out from that wall and stand at his original position in a daze as if nothing had happened did he bitterly laugh. (I understand, he’s completely guessing. He’ll use an extreme speed to charge towards whatever direction an attack comes from. Using the sensing of the surrounding ten metres around him, he’ll then attack anyone in that area. Although his attacks can’t break open the defense of the sheath, being pushed away by his force still hurts…) After he laughed bitterly for a long while, Julian still couldn\u0027t come up with any methods. This Zheng Zha was even more terrifying than a tortoise with thorns on it. He couldn’t be beaten and couldn’t be hit. In short, he felt difficult to deal with. If he had known earlier on it would be like this, he should have had long since exchanged for a sci-fi weapon. After he turned Zheng blind and deaf, he could directly attack him from a distance using the sci-fi weapon. (There’s no choice. It’s time to use the Arayashiki!) Julian’s expression became serious. He suddenly opened his eyes completely. In the instant he opened his eyes, the originally quiet and unmoving Zheng suddenly turned towards his direction. Although there was no attack yet, Zheng’s entire attention was focused towards that direction. “Noticed it? Although it’s not being used yet, you can still feel this pressure, right? That’s right, this is my final trump card, Arayashiki. It’s also known as the Six Paths of Samsara. This is power I obtained from entering deep into the depths of the heart and the consciousness after using the ‘Shaka’ enhancement that I exchanged…” Julian laughed coldly. At the same time, he charged towards Zheng, snapping his finger. The fingers let out a sound, and at the same time, Zheng felt the Qi and Blood Energy in his body rumble and churn. Zheng almost couldn’t prevent his energy from going berserk. Even then he received some small internal injuries, and a small amount of blood leaked out of a corner of his lips. (That’s right, this is… Light of the Soul!) Light of the Soul, telekinesis, force of the soul, A.T. Field. These terms all referred to the same thing, where one would comprehend a certain power after unlocking the fourth stage of the genetic constraint and overcoming the heart’s devil. For example, Zheng’s Light of the Soul was the Dragon Transformation. Although it was the change of a material body, this was how his Light of the Soul manifested itself. Another example, the Light of the Soul of Zhao Yingkong’s main personality was energy absorption. That black light could cut open energy. And there was also that psyche force user Zheng saw in Zhao Yingkong’s memories, Zhao Ruikong. Her Light of the Soul was hypnotism of a deep layer of the consciousness. The so-called Arayashiki by that Julian before him was an ability of that type. Not only could it hypnotise and control living organisms, it could also hypnotise and control the genes, thus causing the collapse and destruction of the human body. This was an overbearing and terrifying power. If one hadn’t unlocked the fourth stage of the genetic constraint or above, it could be said that there was basically nothing one could do to counterattack. Of course, the price to possess this kind of Light of the Soul was also very great. Apart from being a psyche force user, one also had to completely sink to the deepest depths of the consciousness and transform into a devil there... “I didn’t think… you’ll actually have this level of strength.” Zheng exhaled. He then suddenly roared, and his genetic constraint began to unlock at high speed. It rose nonstop from the second stage of the genetic constraint. When it reached the fourth stage, Julian’s expression finally changed. Zheng seemed to not care. He continued to unlock the genetic constraint, and finally… the mid fourth stage of the genetic constraint! The product of his Light of the Soul, the Dragon Transformation appeared! With a crash, that pair of dragon wings of Zheng’s abruptly spread out, tearing his clothes to shreds. At the same time, his figure and appearance continuously changed. By the final change, Julian had long since retreated a hundred metres away. It wasn’t that he was scared, but that the mighty pressure around Zheng at that moment was too extreme. Staying next to Zheng was like having Mt.Tai bearing down. “You’re too dangerous. This level of strength isn’t suitable to appear in the real world. I originally thought you only knew how to do some sealing of the senses and some simple hypnotism. But you actually can use this move… You’re too dangerous for my comrades. I can’t let you get near them. I need to get rid of you here… We’ll cancel the bet from before. I’m giving up on the plans to use you…” Julian laughed coldly. He was confident of not being killed with the protection of the ‘Everdistant Utopia’. He thus wasn’t worried of dying at this point, only using his consciousness to speak, “You’re aware of the existence of the Arayashiki? This is an ability that I can’t completely control at my current rank. But did you know the edge it gives me is already extremely obvious? I also call the Arayashiki a seed. I bury the psyche force imprint of the Arayashiki into a person’s consciousness. Before long that person’s consciousness will be completely eroded by my seed. That person will then become my puppet, like this sheath user… Perhaps you don’t know? I have already implanted seeds into your comrade’s consciousness. Only yours is too strong. Those who’ve overcome the heart’s devil really aren’t ordinary. But I just need to defeat you, and I’ll take over your comrades from you… That’s right. Perhaps your clone has the complete Arayashiki. Otherwise, how could even ‘God’ be unable to repair them? One day, I’ll reach that level as well hahaha…” Zheng ignored him, and suddenly changed the Magic outside his body into the shape of a long whip. It transformed from an area of ten metres to a long whip extending to a hundred metres. Then with him as the centre it begun to revolve. The first to be touched by this whip was the middle-aged Caucasian standing not far off. After feeling where the middle-aged Caucasian was, Zheng suddenly rushed towards that direction, kicking him right in the chest and sending that middle-aged Caucasian over a hundred metres away. When Zheng kicked that middle-aged Caucasian, that white light flashed past as before, and completely offset the destructive power of that kick. But it couldn’t dispel the force, and that middle-aged Caucasian still flew over a hundred metres away before standing up safe and sound. Julian laughed coldly upon seeing this, before saying, “Apart from the attack of the Arayashiki you know of, there’s another attacking method. A pity that I definitely won’t use this move on myself…” Finished speaking, he snapped his fingers again. When the snapping sounded, all the muscles on that middle-aged Caucasian suddenly started to swell violently. Those muscles seemed to have a life of their own as it wriggled nonstop, and actually tore themselves out of the body within a short time, chaotically moving nonstop as if they were tentacles. The man’s body also swelled, only stopping when it reached three metres tall. The person combined with those tentacle like muscles looked disgusting and terrifying. The only curious thing was that despite this person’s muscles and skin having already been torn to this extent, he had yet to bleed, as if his body had already been like this originally. Zheng actually hadn’t seen all this. In the instant his magic whip came into contact with the middle-aged Caucasian, he rushed over again. This time when he punched out, the destructive power of his fists was still offset by that white light. The middle-aged Caucasian only faintly shook this time and didn’t even retreat in the slightest. Then, multiple thick muscles coiled up, violently lashing out at Zheng. There was a loud slapping sound, and those strips of muscle were blocked by Zheng’s arm. Although Zheng didn’t even shake, the steel floor beneath their feet was torn open. The enormous force could only flow into the ground from their legs. At this time Zheng singlehandedly held those strips of meat. That white light suddenly appeared, making it such that he couldn’t damage those strips of muscles no matter how he pinched. Julian laughed coldly. “Don’t try any longer, you’re just a sandbag now. Only we can hit you. You simply cannot hurt us…” Just as these words fell, a giant crimson blade suddenly appeared in Zheng’s hand. When the Magic surrounding Zheng’s body suddenly gathered, in the next second, that thick band of muscles were evenly cut off, and that white light… seemed to be unable to block the Tiger’s Soul that had gathered Magic!
