{"id":58404,"no":683,"title":"Vol 21 Chapter 8-4","content":"Putting aside the rookie’s battle temporarily and going to the other side, just as Honglu decimated the whole outer perimeter soldiers and Chengxiao courageously lured over the Shade due to his power, Zheng was also fighting bravely in the Abyss far below the capital. “Dammit, are you really not done over there yet, Xuan?” Zheng howled at the metal plate, “I really can’t hold on much longer on my side!” In the Abyss, countless reptiles had appeared once again on the ground in the time since the five super monsters hatched. Half of them didn’t begin devouring each other, instead overlaying on each other and forming a pillar. The pillar had a diameter of forty metres and an ever increasing height. The remaining four super monsters didn’t devour those small reptiles and all walked to the pillar. They then walked along the throng of reptiles, the pillar, up to the hole in the sky. At the start, Zheng had still waited for a while and hadn’t paid much attention to it. Although it looked extremely thick, the pillar was constructed from flesh and blood after all. Three of the monsters couldn’t fly, and when they reached a up high, the pillar would snap in half. He refused to believe those monsters could survive a several thousand metres fall. But what happened next exceeded his expectations. The reptiles didn’t have much attack power, but their bodies were tough and tenacious, even exceeding that of the first kind of giant flying demon. How could it be described? The pillar these reptiles formed was like those very sticky kinds of rubber. Every sabre strike would gouge out a large hole from the pillar, but the pillar didn’t fall, instead continuing to rise stably. Since the pillar couldn\u0027t be chopped down, Zheng focused his concentration on those giant demons instead. The three demons looked not to be trifled with, and the pitch black bone dragon flew up from the ground at this moment. The twenty metre long body didn’t look that overwhelming. However, the Qi within Zheng\u0027s body began to flow automatically as the bone dragon drew near. Obviously, the pitch black aura around its body wasn’t anything good. Zheng wanted to launch an attack a few times, but when he saw those countless reptiles still devouring and evolving, it was hard to avoid hesitation springing up in his heart. After all, he didn’t know how long Xuan needed to complete the side quest and how long he himself needed to hold on for. If he depleted his energy completely too soon, the battle after would be very lopsided. That was why until that bone dragon flew up to protect the pillar, Zheng’s attacks had been quite weak. The bone dragon’s pitch black aura stimulated him however. The pillar was already over a thousand metres as of this moment, and half of the reptiles on the ground were gone. The other half were mutually devouring each other, merging together into a giant blood cocoon. It looked to have an approximate diameter of sixty metres. At one glance, it was obviously a monster stronger than the Balrog. He saw reptiles once again gradually bubblling forth from the ground. Just as another hundred of millions of reptiles seemed about to appear, Zheng finally decided to counterattack. He had to suppress that pillar at the very least. Block! A clear clanging sound. Zheng blocked a tail attack the bone dragon had swung over. He didn’t know what material this bone dragon was made from. It’s hardness wasn’t inferior to Tiger’s Soul, and the bone dragon also possessed tremendous force. Under that collision, Zheng couldn’t bear it with his Explosion-class power and was sent flying several tens of metres backwards before stopping. “So, you’ll take me for a sick cat if I don’t show you the might of a tiger?” Zheng was struck into a rage, and loudly roared, entering Destruction once again. He could no longer be caught by the naked eye. After slapping Zheng away with a tail attack, the bone dragon had planned to follow up with a breath attack. But, the far off Zheng had already disappeared just as it opened its mouth. In the next instant, Zheng had appeared on its head. He violently kicked down from above its head, sending the bone dragon crashing towards the pillar. With a tearing sound, this ball of black aura actually scattered the pillar into several sections, like a knife going through tofu. Then, the pillar collapsed in mid-air! ‘Destruction’ lived up to its name. Its strength couldn’t be increased further, and the bone dragon’s skull couldn’t even withstand a simple kick. After being sent flying a hundred metres, its skull began to crack open, its body then gradually following. But before this skeleton could completely scatter, eight hands suddenly extended from the pillar. Each hand grasped and pulled out a rib bone. In the instant the skeleton broke apart, an eight armed three headed female demon burst out. Like eight bone swords, the eight rib bones slashed towards Zheng from different directions. That speed was only slower than Zheng in destruction by a slight fraction. The sound of clanging rang out once again. Zheng’s kick was forced to a stop, but he casually chopped down with a sabre strike. It was the so-called breaking through technique with force. He didn’t even need to pay attention to the bone swords from eight directions, and just chopped down normally at one of the bone swords. The enormous force instantaneously shattered the bone sword and sent the female demon crashing into the pillar. The violent wind blade formed even shaved several metres of height off the pillar, until a giant three headed dog appeared from amongst the meat and blood below. One head bit hold of Tiger’s Soul, while another bit at Zheng’s legs. The final head opened its mouth wide. Lightning flashed within the last head, and during that crackling, Zheng had already been viciously struck by the lightning. He was blown away ten metres up. His clothes had already been long since charred black. He forcefully stepped down on thin air, charging back down. Misty sabre light appeared around the Tiger’s Soul in his hand… “Dammit, are you really not done over there yet, Xuan?” Minutes before, this had echoed out from Xuan’s metal piece, but Xuan ignored it. He only wholeheartedly focused on adjusting the magic formation under his fingers. Yingkong was calmly standing beside him, protecting him. “Is it really fine? We don\u0027t need to respond to Zheng?” For a long time, Yingkong went back and forth between speaking and not speaking. In the end, she was finally being unable to resist speaking. “Hmm? Yes, there’s no need to respond.” Xuan’s face was expressionless as he continued looking down. “He’s a qualified combatant. Accurately speaking, team China can no longer keep up with him. He’s too strong. This kind of strength may sometimes bring harm, but he is the sole person that can save our team at this moment.” Yingkong asked curiously, “What monsters are below? Are the numbers very great, or are they very strong?” Xuan gave her a brief look. He pushed up his spectacles. His head lowered, he said, “Their numbers are great and their power is also great. With the passing of time, the monster’s power will continuously rise. The one thing we can do is finish this side quest within the fastest time, then finish this movie. Otherwise… we will all die in this world.” Yingkong immediately went quiet. This girl should currently be in her secondary personality. Although she had a cold exterior, she was fierily passionate within. She was quiet for a long while, before suddenly asking, “Can you really not tell me this secret? What secret did you all obtain below?” “Impossible.” Xuan wasn’t impatient and evenly said, “Even I don’t have the qualifications to know this secret. Practically no one does, unless they have unlocked the fifth stage of the genetic constraint or have a complete and developed Cultivation technique. Otherwise, we don’t have the qualification to touch this secret. Fortunately, we have an item with power on par with the fifth stage and complete, developed Cultivation techniques. I wouldn’t know how to prevent a team wipe otherwise.” (An item of fifth stage-class power or complete, developed Cultivation techniques? Isn’t that the Magic Cannon?) Yingkong secretly pondered continuously. However, she quickly quietened down. However, a question in her heart remained unanswered. How had they not achieved the qualification ls to obtain this answer with how close the final battle was? Then, when would they obtain the qualifications? Just as this young girl’s heart was secretly filled with misgivings, the magic formation below abruptly shone. The magic runes then gradually dimmed. When all the runes completely disappeared, the room door behind the formation softly opened. The distinctive intonation of God resounded within her mind. “Eragon side quest begins. Rescue Arya. As well as all who protect and are willing to follow her, bring them all out of the capital. All team members will obtain 5000 points and a rank B reward. If Arya dies, all members will be deducted 10000 points and two rank B rewards.” “Eragon mission, destroy Alagaesia’s capital!” Xuan silently rose from the ground. He was quiet for about two or three seconds, before saying to Yingkong, “Come. Save Arya and let her bring those villagers away. Zheng should be able to last for about ten minutes more. We’ll complete the movie within ten minutes. Otherwise, a monster that exceeds us in power may appear below.” Below in the Abyss, even lower than where Zheng was battling, that giant cocoon had already swelled up to a size of a hundred metres. The blood coloured blood cocoon radiated a bloody light, while countless reptiles continued to merge within it as before...
