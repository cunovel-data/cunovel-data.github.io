{"id":58381,"no":660,"title":"Vol 20 Chapter 16-1","content":"Zheng’s original plan was to capture the psyche force user of team Pacific alive. He would then either search for his remaining comrades or wait for Xuan’s plan to finish, before seeing whether it was possible to wake up the remaining unconscious members of team China. He was instead helpless in the end. This psyche force user was stronger than he had imagined, and didn’t seem to be like those who enslaved their teams like cattle. He possessed extraordinary intellect and powerful strength. Especially was that Julian, who had yet to reach the fourth stage, actually possessed Light of the Soul, and one that was related to psyche force at that. This was too dangerous. If he got near the other members of team China, it would definitely result in heavy casualties. Thus, Zheng directly chose to use the most direct and violent method, and even used the Tiger’s Soul blade. He directly used the method he had used to break the prototype god’s A.T. Field at that time. He used Magic to chop out with the blade. Although the toughness of that white light was surprising, the Tiger’s Soul filled with Magic actually still required exertion before it could chop apart the white light. But it still chopped apart the white light, and Zheng knew that this pair was definitely finished. Julian was scared stupid himself. He had never expected the ‘Everdistant Utopia’ would have a time when it was broken through. This feeling made his thinking come to a halt. Based on the situation he knew, the ‘Everdistant Utopia’ was close to a perfect and flawless defense. This was because it was no longer just an energy based type of defense, but one formed from spatial distortion. This had already neared the domain of ‘god’. Spatial and spatial distortion techniques were a characteristic of SS class and above defensive equipment. “Dodge, QUICKLY DODGE IT!” Julian froze for a long time and he loudly shouted when he saw Zheng raise Tiger’s Soul once again. But his words obviously weren’t faster than the chopping attack of Tiger’s Soul. A crimson coloured light flashed past lightly. A large majority of that monster’s tentacles outside his body had already disappeared. The might of the light blade of Tiger’s Soul was extremely great. Mist-like saber light brushed past, and with Zheng and the monster as the centre, the metal ground in the surrounding ten metres became powder, and that white light surrounding the monster remained tough. (Is that so? It’s not possible to break through the white light without gathering magic… This defense is really tough. Perhaps it has already surpassed the maximum defense of that prototype god?) Zheng sighed endlessly in his heart, and his hand moved continuously. That monster was suppressed by layers upon layers of those crimson light blades piled up upon each other. That monster, which had seemingly been unafraid of Zheng before, was really agile now as it began to flee. As Zheng had lost his direct senses, there was a slight lag for his actions. He had no choice but to use force to stop it, and forcefully suppress the monster in the light blades. Julian no longer paid attention to the battle after he shouted. He instead wholeheartedly began to think through how to solve the situation before him. This was originally the performance he had been the most pleased of. He could trap Zheng, who had the strongest battle power. Killing him or subduing him were all within the realms of possibility. This was the scheme he was most pleased with. Who would know that the situation would suddenly reverse, and Zheng could kill all living things before him within an instant. This situation had already become a dire situation from the difficult situation in the beginning, and it was a dire situation that was directed at him! (His strength has already exceeded the limits of wisdom. Has he reached the stage where he can overcome wisdom with force? No matter how ingenious my schemes are, as long as he takes out that sabre of his, I have no way of killing him… As expected, when strength reaches a certain level, wisdom is no longer enough to harm this strength. Or is my wisdom just not enough?) Julian laughed bitterly as he contemplated nonstop. As he contemplated, that monster far off had already been chopped in half by Zheng. That white light protecting the body seemed unable to block the Tiger’s Soul filled with Magic, just like how snow would directly thaw when it met the blazing sun. Although only the battling Zheng could know this feeling, but based on the current battle situation, this body protecting white light was truly weak. Julian finally made a certain decision. (I don’t care anymore! Protecting my life is the most important thing. Nothing can be compared to my life...) Without saying anything further, Julian directly used psyche force to connect with Zheng’s mind. He also used a psyche force scan at the same time on the extremely far off area where Lionheart was battling. There, Zheng’s comrades had already reached a desperate stage. Lionheart with his nearly invulnerable body hadn’t been killed, while the members of team China had been sucked dry of energy. A large group of team China members were heading there. But as they didn’t know the specifics, it seemed as if they wouldn’t be able to stop Lionheart from killing the three members of team China. That was the rough gist of the situation. “Zheng Zha, I’m right here. You can kill me anytime. But from the beginning, I haven’t had much ill will towards you… On the other side, your comrades are in the dire straits of being at death’s door. As long as you promise not to kill me, and let me leave here, I’ll stop Lionheart and save your comrades. How about it? Let me go!” Zheng bisected the monster in one strike, before Tiger’s Soul flashed again. It chopped it up into pieces of meat, and at the same time an image was sent to his consciousness through psyche force. In the image, Heng, Wangxia, Chengxiao and Imhotep had all been sucked dry of their energy, lying on the ground listlessly. Lionheart, however, was covered in blood coloured light that soared to the skies. The bat wings on his back began to become larger, and some blood coloured rune words even appeared on the wings. It currently seemed to be in the midst of an evolution, which was why he wasn’t free to pay attention to the team China members lying on the ground. Otherwise, they would mostly likely have been wiped out in one move. “Lionheart possesses an absorption ability. Thus, he will become stronger and stronger in the team battles, and will one day surpass everyone in all the teams sooner or later. This was also why I chose him before… Zheng, Zheng Zha?” Julian was originally talking to himself. However, he discovered that Zheng was violently trembling all over. His dragon wings then suddenly thrust out, while at the same time his figure began to expand. Before Julian could respond, he faced an unknown aura that frenziedly rushed over head on. His position was enveloped in this aura in an instant. In the next second, a giant hand grabbed his neck and lifted him up. “Lead the way… or die!” Julian only felt like a giant vise was clamping down on his neck. Don’t even talk about breathing, even his mind instantly sank into a dizzy state as the main arteries in his neck were being crushed. Fortunately, his reaction was fast. His psyche force immediately sent a message of agreement to Zheng. His neck was finally loosened, and only then could he gasp in large mouthfuls of air and start coughing. Julian was truly straightforward. As he no longer had any basis for negotiations anyways, he straightforwardly removed the the seals on Zheng’s senses. He returned his sight, hearing and touch to him. Not only that, but he also shut his eyes once more. Apart from searching through the monster corpse for the sheath, he didn’t do anything else. That was why Zheng allowed him to take the sheath. “Alright. I roughly understand your power… This is already power we can’t imagine. Most likely only those few of team Celestial, as well as your legendary clone from team Devil can match you. I no longer have any doubts towards your strength… But how will you get there? Even if you rush there with your previous speed, it would probably still take over a minute. Your members would most likely already be…” Julian hugged the sheath, slightly relaxing as he spoke to Zheng. “Know why I let you retrieve this sheath? This thing isn’t inferior to SS class defensive equipment after all, so why would I let you take it?” Zheng said coldly. “It’s not that I have confidence in killing you easily. Even with this confidence, I’m also lazy to let you take back the sheath before I kill you. It’s because you will need the sheath soon… I said this before, who do you think I am? I’m THE Zheng Zha! To deal with me, please either call an entire team or an entire army! Understand?” As he spoke, Zheng began to shout madly, and his Blood Energy began to rush downwards from his head region, while his Qi rose upwards from his dantian. Two streams of energy violently collided intensely at the area of his heart. Those energies that mixed as well as oil and water abruptly exploded, surging wildly towards all the parts of his body. If it was an ordinary person’s body, they would have been killed in an instant by the backlash of these energies. Only Zheng with the strong fleshy body of his Dragon Transformation could suppress these energies, and let these energies collide and explode continuously. “This is ‘Destruction\u0027!” Zheng shouted loudly, and charged towards a certain wall with Julian in one arm. A crimson coloured light blade then flashed past, and this metal alloy wall was sliced apart like tofu. Zheng stepped down, and his entire figure had already suddenly charged through. Julian smiled bitterly as he grasped the sheath tightly. The white coloured light wrapped him up in a cocoon, and metal fragments and wind assaulted him continuously from all sides. It was indeed impossible for his constitution to block these assaults. It was no wonder Zheng returned him the sheath. If he had known earlier Zheng possessed such a terrifying level of strength, honestly speaking, he would have carefully chosen his battle strategy. “But even with this level of power, you still won’t be able to get to Lionheart so fast, right? Need my help?” Julian asked curiously. “Scan the topography from here to there and send it to me, then… this is…” Zheng’s body suddenly sank. Two streams of energy that had never been used before and had always lain dormant began to squirm. It then collided at his heart area like how Blood Energy and Qi did… “This is … Chaos!
