{"id":58356,"no":635,"title":"Vol 20 Chapter 5-3","content":"Zheng moved along the road carrying Juntian on his hand. His physical prowess was extraordinary and allowed him to leap from car to car relying on only his physical strength. Furthermore, the most basic movement technique he exchanged eased this task even more. He barely broke a sweat on his way to the White House at a speed that wasn\u0027t much slower than a sedan driving on a highway at full speed. Juntian on the other hand wasn\u0027t so well. Cold air stuffed his mouth when he opened it so he had to keep his lips closed. Zheng wasn\u0027t aware of Juntian\u0027s condition. He repeatedly asked him for the direction while he ran. After a while of no response from Juntian, he finally looked down and found the man\u0027s eyes were rolling over. It shocked him to quickly stop by a black sedan and carefully channel Qi into his body. Juntian nearly fell unconscious at the time. The Qi felt like a stream of warmth that rushed into his body and stopped by the navel area. This stimulation brought him back from the unconsciousness. The first thing he did was saying, \"stop,\" then he breathed heavily. Zheng said apologetically. \"Sorry I forgot you haven\u0027t received any enhancements. You\u0027re still a normal person. You probably couldn\u0027t stand the speed I was running. Are you okay?\" Juntian forced a smile on his face. \"Is this the strength of a member in this realm? Hoho, that was beyond my expectation. Like a scene taken from a sci-fi or Wuxia movie. Was that the lightness martial art? It was impressive, felt like I riding a car at full speed.\" Zheng chuckled then asked. \"Which direction is the White House at? Hoho. Sorry for that. I will channel Qi into your body when I run so it won\u0027t happen again.\" Juntian\u0027s thoughts paused for an instant when he heard the noun Qi. He quickly pulled his mind back to the present then looked left and right. He pointed at a building and said. \"That way. With the speed that you were going, it should be about thirty minutes from here. Can we come to an agreement? Your speed is too hard to bear. Why don\u0027t you let me down and I can walk…\" Before he finished talking, Zheng had picked him up and begun to run. The cold air blowing at his face forced him to close his eyes. However, he didn\u0027t feel the suffocation that he experienced before and he could open a slim gap with his eyes. That was when he finally noticed a stream of warmth coming from Zheng\u0027s hand that entered and stimulated his body. The unbearable feeling was gone and a comfortable sensation replaced it. \"Is this Qi? I couldn\u0027t imagine the things from Wuxia novels are actually real.\" Juntian said with surprise. Zheng laughed. \"This is God\u0027s Realm. God has a lot of inconceivable things you can exchange, from eastern mythology, to western mythology, to future technology, from movies to anime to comic. Even veterans like us still haven\u0027t figured out how many things you can exchange from God. It\u0027s almost infinite. Anyway, you will have to survive first. Then become stronger, until you are strong enough to live in this realm. Then you can return to the real world.\" Juntian felt tempted, especially after he experienced the marvelous Qi. A desire for God\u0027s dimension took root in his heart. Though the state he was in halted his thoughts. The cold air still felt sharp to the skin despite the Qi. He had to put all his effort on keeping his eyes open to distinguish the direction. While Zheng ran, he also talked. \"The White House… is there.\" Zheng ran down from the highway following Juntian\u0027s direction. He made a turn on a street and a long, straight path lay in front of him. At the end of the path was where the president of the United States resided, the White House. Countless civilians surrounded the White House causing a ruckus. Some people held up banners and cried slogans. Some attempted to rush into the White House. The numerous guards and fences stopped these civilians but they couldn\u0027t stop the noises. Having failed to achieve their goals, the civilians cried even louder. Another group of people was pointing at the dish floating in the sky. A thousand meters above the ground, and under the sky fortress was a dish stopped there quietly. \"Whew. We made it in time. Team Pacific didn\u0027t blast the White House in one shot or we would have to run for the next several days like Xuan said.\" Zheng let out a sigh of relief when he saw the White House still stood intact. He put down Juntian. The two slowly walked toward the White House but were stopped by the packed crowd. Zheng had no choice but to pick Juntian up again and forced his way through the crowd. In just a second, they carved a path in the crowd. Zheng suddenly put Juntian down and said in a low volume. \"Hide among the crowd. The other team\u0027s psyche force user has detected us. Keep yourself hidden. Don\u0027t show any abnormality from normal people. You should be able to hide with so many people here.\" He jumped on top of several normal people and leaped again from their heads. By the time these people noticed, Zheng had already crossed the metal fences and through the wall into the White House. A person gliding in the air looked exactly like kungfu from Chinese Wuxia novels. This person was stepping on people\u0027s heads but no one suffered any harm. Zheng safely landed on the ground and the crowd around him was shocked. For a few seconds, the noises halted and then the crowd erupted again. Zheng didn\u0027t bother to pay attention to the crowd. He held Tiger\u0027s Soul in his hand and was prepared to strike the dish with the technique he had only just discovered. A thousand meters weren\u0027t impossible, even though that technique would leave him critically injured. This technique that he hadn\u0027t tested yet could be a double-edged sword. The federal police from the White House quickly came over and drew their guns at Zheng. Their nerves were tensed upon seeing the large crimson sword he was holding. At a time when the aliens were invading the Earth and society was in a turmoil, important political figures being attacked by psychopaths would be catastrophic. If Zheng were to show even a hint of abnormal behavior, these police would open fire. (Right, high tech weapons. The weapons the aliens use are also high-tech weapons so the Dragonshard necklace should serve some degree of defense. It just wouldn\u0027t defend against the main weapon of the fortress.) Zheng looked at the police and their guns then ignored them. His eyes moved to the dish above, pondering if he should enter Dragon transformation and fly up to attack. The dragon form was his only method to come into close range with the dish after the Sky Sticks became forbidden. While he was pondering, the dish lowered itself and stopped at a hundred meters above the ground. A blue light shone down from a port on the center of its underside onto an area ten meters in front of Zheng. (Fire? Looks similar to the fire from the Destroyer in the movie. Didn\u0027t know this little dish can use the same attack. Should I attack? In the movie, attacking the Destroyer while it is firing will trigger intense explosions. Aren\u0027t these people from team Pacific scared?) Zheng was thinking if he should attack. The blue light rippled like water. When the light returned to still, a Caucasian with blonde hair was standing in the light. He looked about twenty-four years old with an extremely attractive face and over six feet tall. Such a person in the real world could easily become a top celebrity. However, he would be seemed flaunting in God\u0027s Realm. The Caucasian was dressed in a classic duke\u0027s attire that one would associate with European vampires. A red velvet cape draped over his back. The slightly gloomy expression on top of his face and clothes made him look even more like a vampire in legends. He was holding a rose that was wilting at visible pace. Zheng looked at Juntian then at the vampire cosplay Caucasian. He said in a low volume. \"Traitors are no match for real westerners. Authentic westerners are the real flaunt.\" The Caucasian said. \"I am the leader of team Pacific, Lionheart Grims. You can call me Lionheart.\" (An equally flaunting name. Reminds me of some invincible main characters in novels. That sparkling blonde hair and attractive face… did he altered his appearance through God?) Zheng thought with malicious intent. He stared at the blonde Caucasian and said in a serious tone. \"Leader of team China, Zheng Zha.\" Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-20-chapter-5-03","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
