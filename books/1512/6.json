{"id":57727,"no":6,"title":"Vol 1 Chapter 3-2","content":"Zombies kept swarming in from all sides. Even though they looked scary, the zombies actually moved rather slow. Under Zheng\u0027s full concentration, the zombies couldn\u0027t get close to them. But as the number of zombies that died under his gun increased, he was only left with one magazine. On the other side, the mercenaries opened the door leading to a laboratory. However, a bunch of zombies suddenly swarmed out and pulled the mercenary who opened the door inside. His last scream was horrifying. As said before, you may not think much of this when watching a movie, but when the same thing happened next to you, that horror was indescribable. One shouted, \"Back to the Red Queen\u0027s room! Back there!\" Before long over ten zombies had moved in between Zheng\u0027s group and the mercenaries. As they were stumbling towards Zheng, the three could smell that stink. Xiaoyi couldn\u0027t help but yell, \"Zheng, shoot them, hurry!\" As the viewers knew, anyone who got bit or clawed by the zombies will get infected. The only vaccines were still in the train. They would die before getting to the train. They were still only normal people after all. Zheng was getting anxious as he saw the mercenaries get further away. More zombies were appearing through the corner yet his ammo was getting lower. \"Ten, nine, eight...\" Zheng silently counted the bullets in his gun. Then suddenly the zombies in front of him were dropping down one by one. Jie appeared behind them and shouted, \"What are you doing? Didn\u0027t I tell you to follow them? Haven\u0027t you seen the movie? A Licker will appear here.\" Jie kept on shooting, and without taking another look at the three, he ran towards where the mercenaries went. Zheng, Lan and Xiaoyi followed. (His speed is about 20% faster than us. He probably enhanced his muscles.) Zheng was inspecting Jie when they ran. He found that his body couldn\u0027t catch up with his thinking speed or reaction speed. It was most prominent when he was shooting. With the addition of Jie, the four of them finally arrived at the central computer room. Then with a loud bang, the door was shut and the zombies were blocked outside. Everyone suddenly dropped to the floor. Aside from Jie, they were panting heavily, gasping for air. Even when their lungs were filled with air, the terror kept them breathing heavily. It took a while for the three to calm down. \"That was not bad.\" Jie put his gun on the waist and laughed at Zheng. \"What do you mean?\" Jie turned around to look at the mercenaries. They were looking at the corpses in that laser corridor. Then he said in a low voice. \"The most dangerous time for a newbie is usually the first movie. Mentality is the most important. First you have to understand your situation. I have seen many people who thought this was some illusion or a TV program so they died the fastest. But the three of you quickly adjusted your mentalities. Especially you and Lan. You were the best out of all the newbies I\u0027ve met. Not only did you adjust your mentality quickly but also overcame your fears.\" \"Secondly, overcoming your fears isn\u0027t enough to live. You are still only a normal person in the first movie. Even if you know the plot, it\u0027s still easy to die. So the first movie also heavily depends on luck. As long as you lived through the first movie, you can enhance yourself and exchange weapons; like my gun.\" After saying all this, Jie took out a pack of cigarettes and handed one to Zheng. \"Congratulations, newbies. How does it feel to be alive? Hahaha.\" Xiaoyi came over, \"Jie, give me one too.\" Jie glanced at him, \"Don\u0027t think I can\u0027t smell it. You do not have a hint of cigarette scent on you. If you don\u0027t want to die then follow us.\" Xiaoyi lowered his head, \"Jie, I am already at negative ten points. What should I do?\" Jie laughed and said, \"You lost ten points instead of earning any? Your luck is better than average. Don\u0027t worry, you will get 1000 points at the end; but remember, if you are still in the negative after that 1000 points, you will be erased from the world.\" Then someone knocked on the door. Alice\u0027s voice came from outside the room. \"Open the door. Hurry!\" The mercenaries came over and Jie opened a crack for Alice and Matt to get in. One asked them, \"How is it outside? Can we go back the way we came?\" Alice shook her head, \"They are all over the place.\" Everyone fell to a silence. Kaplan broke down. \"We can\u0027t escape. There\u0027s no other path in the Red Queen\u0027s room. We\u0027re done!\" Then Spence said, \"Couldn\u0027t we stay here? Once the outside finds out we are missing, they will send backup. I think we\u0027re safe here. I don\u0027t want to go out and fight those undead.\" But the mercenaries looked embarrassed, Spence asked curiously, \"Did I say something wrong?\" Kaplan replied, \"There probably isn\u0027t anymore backup.\" Spence was irritated and grabbed his collar. \"What do you mean no backup?\" One sighed, \"Our orders were to bring back the Red Queen\u0027s main circuit and isolate the Hive from the outside. Remember the path that goes from the building to the Hive? If we\u0027re not back there by three hours the gate will shut, thus isolating the Hive. F*ck the corporation, I understand why we received such orders.\" Zheng\u0027s group looked at each other. They also knew what the timer meant on their watches. They had to survive until that gate shut. And before that they couldn\u0027t get injured by the zombies, couldn\u0027t fight too many zombies at once, and–with just a desert eagle–couldn\u0027t fight a Licker. Spence let go of Kaplan but he was panicking, \"No! They can\u0027t do this. Are they trying to kill us all down here?\" Rain said, \"This is the safest way to keep the secret of their research. If we all die down here then no one can leak anything out.\" Her hand was bloody where it was bit. People were silent, then Spence got more irritated. \"Why are you telling me this now? Why didn\u0027t you say this before everything happened?\" Then Alice intervened, \"Stop arguing. Let\u0027s find a way out. We will first find a way out of this room.\" She picked up the Red Queen\u0027s main circuit and went into the Red Queen\u0027s room. \"What\u0027re you doing.\" One asked. \"Turning her back on.\" As the mercenaries went away, Zheng asked Jie, \"Aren\u0027t we going to take a look?\" \"What is there to look at? Not like you haven\u0027t seen the movie. You\u0027re better off saving your stamina here and killing a few more zombies later.\" Lan touched her forehead, \"Oh right, Jie, I have a question. How are we going to go back to God\u0027s place? Does it shine a light on you? We slowly fade away? Or a path appear in front of us?\" Jie said, \"I don\u0027t know how we get back. Every time after the mission was over, I\u0027m in the lobby of God\u0027s place the next moment. You don\u0027t have to worry about not being able to go back when the time comes. As long as you are alive–even if you got infected by the T-virus or something–as long as you still have your consciousness everything will go away. Similarly, if you lose an arm or a leg you can repair it with just some points.\" Lan frowned then asked, \"You mentioned mission?\" \"Of course, I said we\u0027re merely struggling to survive. Like when we just got here and couldn\u0027t leave One. That was a special mission. So that\u0027s how it is, sometimes we have to complete some special missions, that\u0027s God\u0027s way of increasing difficulty.\" Lan sighed, \"That\u0027s unfortunate. I originally wanted to... nevermind.\" \"What did you want to do?\" Zheng interrupted, \"You mean let us stay here?\" Lan smiled at Zheng, \"Right. That\u0027s what I wanted to do. Like Jie said we will leave here instantly when the time comes, so we can be at any place unlike the cast. Then why not stay here? I remember in the plot they will go into an underground tunnel and almost get killed by a Licker. Even after they get into the train they are still not safe, then what about this place?\" Zheng and Jie were surprised at Lan. \"You\u0027re afraid God will give us some mission later? Like make us follow another cast? And if we aren\u0027t near them we will die?\" \"Right, this is the safest place if we don\u0027t consider that possibility.\" Jie took a smoke and thought for a bit. \"Okay, we will stay here. God won\u0027t give us impossible missions. Like when the mercenaries go away and we have to be within 300 feet of them. Since it\u0027s decided, we will stay here.\" The three were surprised. Zheng said to Jie, \"You don\u0027t have to stay here like us. We are still normal people but you have a gun and enhanced yourself. Why not go kill zombies for rewards? And if you happen to kill a Licker that\u0027s a hundred points! We\u0027re only staying here because we have to.\" Jie forced a smile, \"To be honest, who the heck wants to be in this place. Anyone will break down from going from one movie to another. This is my fourth one and sometimes I\u0027ve thought about just killing myself.\" \"And I want you guys to live. Sometimes you can\u0027t survive by yourself. If there are some experienced survivors other than myself, then our chances of surviving will be higher. Okay then, we will stay here. Think of what to say to the cast.\" The four of them started discussing until the cast came out. Then they went over to the cast with a smile. Zheng understood. Not only he wanted to live. Everyone else was the same.
