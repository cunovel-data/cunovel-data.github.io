If Xuan were standing in front of him at this moment, he would beat the crap out of him. The man was vexatious. Zheng had fallen into danger again.\n (It’s more strange than actually dangerous. Damn it.) Zheng thought as he looked ahead. He was inside YinKong’s consciousness.\n Zheng suddenly had the idea of waking YinKong during his conversation with TengYi. YinKong was a major force in the team after all. Her contribution couldn’t be overlooked. And so he put Xuan’s glasses on her then attached the metallic pieces linked to the glasses onto his temples. He immediately lost consciousness.\n By the time he woke up, he was standing next to a little girl. His existence in this place was ghost-like. No one could see him nor touch him. Neither could he affect anyone. He existed as an observer for three days in this world. Although time flowed differently in a dream, he was afraid what if time in the real world and this dream world flowed at the same rate? Half the team would then get wiped by the Yellow Turbans.\n Zheng had no choice but to accept things as they came despite his worry. This situation was not new to him. The fact was he just went through the same thing in the previous movie. The strangeness and terror of A Nightmare On Elm Street were not something he wished to experience again. He could feel he was inside YinKong’s dream.\n This dream took place on an uninhabited island. Zheng followed the cute little girl for the past three days. She was about eleven or twelve with an apathetic look on her face. It was like a female Xuan. Little YinKong was handsome at such a young age, leaning toward a metrosexual look. Her body had began development. Judging by the bulges on her chests, she definitely wrapped a piece of cloth around the chest.\n (Man, she’s been this cold since she was young. The babyface and big breasts also came at such a young age.) Zheng exclaimed.\n He witnessed her life for the past three days. Everything aside from that cold expression were commendable. She survived comfortably on this uninhabited island. Food was never a worry for her. She caught snakes, insects, beasts, and fish. She would climb the only tall mountain on the island to obtain water from snow. The little creek that was a result of melted snow was the only source of water on this island.\n (Is this really YinKong? How did she become so strong?)\n Zheng finally confirmed this Yinkong possessed strength way beyond what he previously knew of her after the three days of observation. Although he did not underwent any systematic combat training, the fourth stage and all the fighting experiences he gained so far trained his eyes accurately judge a person’s strength. He had an idea of YinKong’s strength thus far. That was — strong. As strong as when he initially entered the fourth stage.\n YinKong was no more than twelve in this dream and she hadn’t entered God’s realm yet. In other words, she achieved this strength in the real world through physical training and techniques. Zheng simply couldn’t believe it. When YinKong climbed a steep mountain to get water on the second day, he confirmed YinKong had at the least unlocked the second stage.\n He didn’t know how she managed to achieve this feat. But young YinKong was stronger than the first time he met her in God’s realm. Something must have happened to her in her childhood.\n (I get it. She didn’t break free from her heart’s devil in A Nightmare on Elm Street. That’s why she’s still asleep. The glasses are an item to bring me into her dream. But — I only exist as an observer here. How can an observer influence the people in the dream? Doesn’t this just trap me here? Shit.)\n There was no use worrying so he continued to watch the little girl. Loli YinKong was very pretty, especially her being alone often brought up alluring scenes. With this, time wasn’t too difficult to get by.\n Afternoon of day four. Zheng finally saw people other than YinKong. Most these children were between fourteen and fifteen. There were both boys and girls totaling ten children. Eleven with YinKong included. The children cheerfully chatted and brought out the food they found. They obviously had exceptional wilderness survival skills given how abundant the food was.\n Zheng could see several children who unlocked the first and second stages. He also saw ZhuiKong to his surprise. The boy looked about seventeen here but his strength was not notable among the other kids. Compared to YinKong’s fourth stage, he was still in the first stage.\n (These kids are strong. Seven people in addition to YinKong unlocked the genetic constraint. She’s the strongest here. There’s another girl between the second and fourth stages. The rest are between first and second stages. Did these kids really never entered God’s realm? It’s almost impossible that the Assassin’s Clan trained them through training in the real world. Otherwise, what do you even need the players for?)\n Zheng was confused by the absurdity. Unlocking the genetic constraint meant the evolution that had stopped awakened once more. Humans who unlocked the constraint ascended to a higher life form. A team’s strength was directly related to the unlock stages its members reached. Yet, only a small fraction of players could unlock the genetic constraint in the nightmarish movies. It was inconceivable that a clan had seven such people among their kids.\n YinKong smiled gently, totally different than the cold expression she had when she was alone. Though the smile did not take away the coldness inside her eyes. This expression was similar to the ZhuiKong in the future.\n “YinKong! You know what? The beach in group C’s area has oysters. Brother and I ambushed two of their members and found it through their words. Why don’t we catch some oysters later?” A twelve years old girl cheerfully said. She was the second strongest person in this group.\n YinKong’s eyes softened up when she looked at the girl. She patted her head and said, “You shouldn’t eat those oysters carelessly, Rui-Kong. Raw seafood can give you diarrhea. And if you get sick in this island, you are likely going to die.”\n Rui-Kong giggled and pushed YinKong’s hand away. “It’s fine. I stepped into that stage right after you. I am not scared of any disease. You just have to modify —“\n YinKong put her hand over the girl’s lips and sighed. “Fine. We will catch oysters tomorrow. Happy now?”\n Rui-Kong cheered as she hugged YinKong and kissed her. Unlike YinKong, she acted like an actual child. YinKong lightly patted her head as a big sister would.\n The boys and girls ate their meals and chatted until the night came before they fell asleep. An hour later, YinKong got up and quietly walked into the forest.\n “Your sister is asleep. Don’t worry, ZhuiKong.” YinKong said to a figure in the dark. “What is the result of the investigation? Can we suppress the genetic constraint? If this condition continues — I am afraid I can no longer suppress it and get consumed by my heart’s devil. Your sister is in a worse condition. Tell me, what came out from investigating the leaders?”\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-7-02","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
