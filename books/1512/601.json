{"id":58322,"no":601,"title":"Vol 19 Chapter 11-6","content":"The tides of a battle were constantly changing. Zheng attentively observed. The berserk of Li-Kong was unexpected. He made a rough estimate and concluded that Li-Kong was still quite a bit weaker than YinKong. He decided not to appear and interfere at the time. It was a difficult task to explain where he came from.\\n\\n When YinKong one shot Li-Kong with ease, he cheered for a second before he saw Li-Kong was still alive and smashed YinKong on the waist with a punch. She coughed up blood and was sent flying. Without any delay, Zheng entered the third stage then emulated YinKong’s thinking process.\\n\\n Li-Kong grabbed his head and neck with his hands then twisted it back to place. Ka-cha~ The bones inside this section of the neck were fractured and his head was in an abnormal position. As Zheng surfaced in the dream world, the skin and flesh on Li-Kong’s neck squirmed like a worm, gradually correcting the distortion.\\n\\n The rest of the people here cried. The girls recovered from the mind control and looked at the scene at a lost. Only a few remained calm. They were still children after all. When a man suddenly appeared, those still composed simultaneously surrounded him.\\n\\n The man was no other than Zheng. His eyes stayed fixed at Li-Kong who was deviating from human with each passing second. Li-Kong’s broken neck slowly recovered. Maybe the bones within were still fractured and the hardened and scaly skin and muscle held his neck in place. Li-Kong walked toward YinKong.\\n\\n (Is that the hibernating genes in his body? Most people in the fourth stage appeared human like. Only those with the genes of the unknown organisms from ancient times will take such a form. This guy… could his ancestor be a lizard or dragon?)\\n\\n Random thoughts flew through Zheng’s head. Zheng had made it through many battlefields and never stopped fighting for his life since entering this realm. His experience came from the many life and death situations. As the children approached him, he gave a shout and unlocked the genetic constraint further into the fourth stage. A wave of killing intent emitted from him and shocked the children in place. Li-Kong also turned his head around abruptly, staring at Zheng with a pair of crimson eyes.\\n\\n “YinKong! I know you can still move! Leave the monster to me. Do what you must do!” Once Zheng grabbed Li-Kong’s attention, he yelled.\\n\\n YinKong was feigning unconsciousness under the tree like he expected. The damage she suffered was big but shouldn’t have knocked her out. To a person in the fourth stage, willpower alone could keep him or her alive.\\n\\n YinKong jumped up from the ground. She looked at Zheng with surprise then dashed toward Rui-Kong.\\n\\n Taking his eyes off YinKong, Zheng focused his attention at the monster in front. He had the confidence to take out Li-Kong with ease but any little bit of detail could turn around the tide of the fight, just like the assassination technique YinKong used on Li-Kong. Martial arts were a tool by created the weak to rival the strong. He was stronger than Li-Kong but techniques had always been his weakness. He could only hope that the lack of rationality Li-Kong was in also took away the assassination techniques. It would be a shame to get killed by a technique.\\n\\n “Come. Show me the power of a berserk fourth stage assassin.” Zheng calmly said. He beckoned with his finger. Blood Energy and Qi began to circulate within. He was ready to activate Explosion the moment Li-Kong came near and deny him the chance to utilize any technique.\\n\\n The frenzy had stripped Li-Kong of his awareness. He didn’t know who he was fighting. Instinct seeked the strongest person he sensed. He finally felt a sense of danger when Zheng surfaced. An instinctive danger like when a beast met a more dangerous beast. He snarled as he walked toward Zheng. His face still looked insane but his steps were cautious.\\n\\n “Hoho. So you can still sense the gap between our strength even in a frenzy.” Zheng glanced over YinKong who had reached Rui-Kong. He breathed out then walked toward Li-Kong with a smile.\\n\\n Li-Kong stopped at five meters from Zheng. His muscle enlarged as if to make a show of strength. Instinct was sending him signals of danger and death if he lingered any longer. He might have ran from this pressure if he didn’t went berserk.\\n\\n Zheng wouldn’t spare him any chances, whether it was the chance to run or to attack. Blood Energy and Qi fused into Explosion and he vanished from everyone’s sights. A trace of a shadow flashed across then a heavy thump followed. Zheng’s fist struck the center of Li-Kong’s chest. Li-Kong’s chest sunk in from the front and protruded from his back. Zheng then kicked him off the ground, scraping a layer off the ground surface in the process.\\n\\n “Is that it? It’s only just started!” Zheng gave a shout. His fists struck Li-Kong’s chest numerous times at unseeable speed. Within a few breaths time, he crushed Li-Kong’s chest. If Li-Kong wasn’t in the air which buffered the attacks, Zheng could have broken him in halves. Still, his heart, lungs, and other pivotal organs were destroyed. He was a goner unless his whole body had transformed into a monster.\\n\\n (I finally get what Luo YinLong meant when he said those words. Stage does not equate to strength. Stage increases naturally just like how we age. However, strength encompasses much more, like techniques and abilities. If I don’t have Explosion, this fight would have taken an hour.)\\n\\n Zheng stood beside the dead body as he recalled his conversation with Luo YinLong in the Lord of the RIngs. Suddenly, he felt a rock flying toward him. He stood there and took the hit then turned around. YinKong was staring at him with a cold expression.\\n\\n “Wait. Am I not helping you?” Zheng thought YinKong loathed him for killing Li-Kong and explained. “I had no choice but to kill him. He was attacking you. Whatever, there’s no point in explaining. I --” He stopped. Something was not right.\\n\\n YinKong’s eyes were bloody red. Her facial expression wasn’t twisted but it appeared that she went berserk.\\n\\n Rui-Kong stood behind YinKong. She pointed at YinKong with one hand then at the other children with the other. Her eyes weren’t red but instead, over eighty percent of the eyes were white.\\n\\n (Did the violent lust consume her mind? So she is in the heart’s devil state?)\\n\\n Zheng knew that the first time a person encountered the heart’s devil, they could usually survive after venting out the insanity. Back in Resident Evil, he killed hundreds of Lickers but he didn’t die from exhaustion. However, the violent lust that poured into the mind at the time wasn’t much less than the actual encounter of the heart’s devil.\\n\\n Rui-Kong had just sustained the mental impact from YinKong. The wave of violent lust from Li-Kong when she wasn’t prepared consumed her mind and pushed her into an encounter with the heart’s devil. This was the other method to bypass the heart’s devil that Zheng thought of, trading one person’s life for another.\\n\\n The people that was running over finally arrived at the battlefield. They were YinKong’s team. And the person leading the team was ZhuiKong.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-11-06","bookId":1512,"book":{"id":1512,"title":"Terror Infinity","description":"“Want to know the meaning of life?
