However, the moment the Charged Shot fixed its target at Sauron, he pulled the mace back in front of his body with unbelievable speed. A magic circle emerged in the air between him and the arrow. The magic circle rotated. The mysterious symbols radiated with a black light. On the far end of the battlefield, SongTian looked down with complicated feelings. His broken arm had stopped bleeding. However, smoking was coming off the wound as if it was being corroded. “... Team China. Their potential is even higher than team Devil’s.” He said with worry. Adam sat beside him. He was doing calculations on a piece of paper. He replied without taking his eyes off the paper. “Yes. Team China has higher potential. Their specializations complement each other. They are still weak but once they grow, they will have a talented individual in every field. Didn’t Luo YingLong say he was killed by a physical bullet from a sci-fi weapon? Even the most powerful weapon, Space Compression Cannon, cannot break through his defensive magical item and kill him in an instant unless there is a unique ability in addition to the sci-fi weapon. If this is the case, the user of this sci-fi weapon must be an individual of extremes in both strong and weak. However, as long as Zheng Zha exists in this team, he will not be held back by his weakness. Similarly, this archer is even more powerful in mid-range distance.” “So.” Adam raised his head and said in a serious manner. “The only ones worth noting in team China are Zheng Zha and Chu Xuan. Every other member is a typical player who possesses critical flaws. However, their potential does exceed team Devil’s potential in a sense.” SongTian sighed as he turned to Adam then to the blonde woman behind Adam. The woman was playing with a glob of light. The light changed shapes as she kneaded it like a liquid. It even tried to change by itself to please her. Luo YingLong seemed rather miserable. “What about us?” SongTian sighed. Adam lowered his head again. “We didn’t suffer much loss. Given you and Luo YingLong’s strength, we can quickly gain a large amount of points and rewards by heading back to our previous movies. However, these are not that useful to us anymore. We lost at ‘influence’ this movie. We no longer have the chips to go against team Devil until we can defeat team China the next time we meet. SongTian, be prepared for a long journey. You have to keep growing. Same to Luo YingLong. He might be our strongest force in the future. Stronger than you…” SongTian turned his head away quietly. “Yes. He has taken off on a different path. If absolute power is a Dao (path), we are walking the enlightenment path. We comprehend all that exist to achieve this path. His path is one of force. A force beyond all that exists, beyond the path itself. He will become the path.” Team Celestial did not react too strongly. Adam’s plan failed in the end but no damage was done to the foundation of their team. None of the core members died. Even though they obtained little in terms of rewards, they also obtained information about other teams. An accurate perception of team China from their own perspective was especially important. Adam had begun his calculations ever since he obtained these information. He kept his head down at the paper and no one knew what he was calculating. Team Celestial could still talk to each other. Team East America was left with only two people. ZhuiKong spared Zheng and his group so he went back to Xuan and retrieved two of his team members. Well, for the retrieval, he killed one of his own member right in front of Xuan and left with the head while laughing. His expression and actions sent chills right into people’s guts. Kampa and WangXia pulled out their weapons as a sign of vigilance at once. Gando was shaking from the shock and urged WangXia to take out his robot. “Relax. I am not in a good mood… I probably won’t kill anymore until the end of this movie. Well then, let us meet again in the next team battle, team China.” ZhuiKong turned back and gave them a smile. He then left with the other team East America member, who also could barely stand from the scare yet still followed behind ZhuiKong. Once the two people left, ZhuiKong stopped on a hillside that could see into the battlefield. He stared at Sauron until YinKong appeared. A smile crept up his face. “Grow. Keep growing. Until we meet again, then…” He covered his face with his hand and laughed. A liquid flowed out between his fingers, just a little that could barely get noticed. On the other end, Sauron was aimed by two bows. Neither Heng nor Legolas fired yet because the mace blocked the arm that wielded the One Ring. They could not fire even if they wanted to. The riders charged at Sauron without regard for their own lives. Their king had died in this battle. The riders’ loyalty overcame their fear of Sauron. It was these brave riders who broke the stalemate. Sauron could not move freely as he showed worry for Heng and Legolas. He used non-physical attacks when the riders charged at him. The rotating magic circles were his best defence. They corroded any rider who ran into the circles into withered bones, and then into ashes. Yet, this appalling scene did not stop the riders. As thousands of them charged, Gandalf began his chanting. Gandalf’s chanting concluded and several translucent barrier walls emerged in the air. The walls collided onto the magic circles. Both of these magics dissolved. The first hundred riders in the front charged at Sauron as they cried, which forced Sauron to use his mace. He raised the hand wielding the one ring. A misty cloud filled his palm. Heng and Legolas fired their arrows at the same time, both targeting the arm that wielded the ring. These two arrows hit the arm one after the other. The arrows pierced into the black mist enveloping Sauron’s arm. The mist consumed Legolas’s arrow. The powerful corrosiveness of the mist corroded the life force and the arrow at once. Sauron merely trembled for a moment. A large portion of the mist dissipated but no damage was done to him. However, the following Charged Shot penetrated the arm at a speed beyond the eyes could capture. It then disappeared in the distance. Heng collapsed after he fired the arrow. He no longer had the ability to participate in the rest of the battle. In contrast, Legolas’s arm was shaking but he managed to placed three more arrows on his bow and aimed them at Sauron. Sauron lost two thirds of his arm. It was kept on his body by a piece of the armor. The black mist extended down from his arm seemingly in an attempt to repair the armor. The front line of the riders reached Sauron. Their spears and swords struck his body, causing ding-dongs from the armor. Yet, they were unable to damage Sauron. A black light radiated from the ring he was holding in the air. Black mist surged from the ring and consumed the riders attacking him. The mist kept expanding, reaching the riders and archers further away. Two seconds later, a thousand meter area of the battlefield was covered in the mist. “YinKong!” Zheng was shocked then he shouted. Qi and Blood Energy rushed through his body. He seemed to have disregarded his injuries and wanted to charge into the battlefield because YingKong was sneaking behind Sauron. She had been inside the mist the whole time. Before Zheng could make his next move, he saw the light behind Sauron became distorted. It was the phenomenon of uneven air density, which was a sign of... The Shining Air Wave! The movements in the Shining state pushed the black mist away from her body. YinKong attacked at the instant where Sauron’s attack reached its peak. The Air Wave sliced off the remaining part of Sauron’s arm. There was no time to worry about the corrosion. YinKong jumped into the black mist and grabbed the torn off arm. Then… the half awake and half dreamy feeling struck. As Zheng opened his eyes, the bright sphere of light floated in front of him. To his side, YinKong’s left arm was corroding away. Her right arm was holding onto the torn off arm.
