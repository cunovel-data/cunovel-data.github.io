He wondered if this man created a similarly powerful ability or one even stronger? “You will see after a fight. You also said that there was no need to say much. When your team attacked us with the intention to wipe us, the word mercy was thrown out of this battle. Imagine that if we were the ones who lost, would you spare the innocent people in our team? Everyone who entered this realm has their stories. No one is completely innocent. Can you say that this girl never participated in our battle?” Zheng stared at the man and said calmly. “Since you attempted to obtain a lucrative reward, you have to bear risks of similar level. You failed right now so don’t wish for unfair mercy. Defeat me and use me to threaten the others in my team. It can protect your team. Or you can accept your fate of failure.” Richard hadn’t shown a response. The Caucasian screamed and charged at Zheng. His physical stats were about three to five times that of normal people. As he approached Zheng, he gradually calmed down. His eyes defocused and he entered the unlocked mode completely when he was ten meters away. Electricity and the sound of thunder enveloped his hands at the same time, sending off a shocking aura. Zheng’s gaze felt cold as he watched the man move closer. He suddenly pulled out Tiger’s Soul from his ring. Such an attention drawing weapon made Richard and the Caucasian’s hearts skip a beat. They had heard Neos’ analysis on the weapons available in God’s dimension. The magical weapons were especially powerful, which this sword looked like from every direction. The Caucasian felt terrified before he even attacked. Fortunately, he was still in the unlocked mode. He jumped backward at once and dodged the slash by a hair. His face was turning paler by the second and he asked in a rush. “What is this weapon? My sense of danger tells me if I get close to it…” He heard the sound of flesh and bone separating. He watched in a daze as his arm was slashed off with a clean cut. The slash also cut two inches into the bottom of his chest, almost injuring his lungs. The man grabbed his arm and screamed in pain. “Why? I didn’t get hit! Is this a weapon that controls the wind like how I control electricity? F*ck. Richard, you wont live for much longer if I die. We need to attack together!” Richard was watching Zheng’s movements closely the whole time. He said. “It wasn’t wind. He channeled energy into the sword just then. It was an invisible energy. Hawfor! Drain the flagship’s energy. We won’t have a chance if you don’t do it now. He’s horrifying. His strength way surpasses the both of us combined. We can’t afford to consider too much. Let us give it one last fight!” A double bladed axe appeared in Richard hand. This axe was over twice the size of Tiger\u0027s Soul, approaching that of a grown man. It looked like he was holding a man in his hand. Hawfor covered the wound on his bleeding arm and screamed. “My Goro Goro no Mi hasn’t reached the final AA rank yet. I won’t be able to turn more energy into electricity no matter how much I drain. And draining more than I can take will make my body explode. Are you trying to kill me? F*ck, my arm hurts.” Richard sighed and didn’t say anything. He gave a shout. A golden light emerged from his body and enveloped him. He suddenly looked like a golden statue. The double bladed axe also glowed in gold. As time passed, this light was slowly absorbed into his body. His muscles were wriggling visibly and he started groaning in pain. Zheng watched with curiosity. He didn’t know if this was the self created ability. His Explosion and Destruction had immense after effects but their usage wasn’t so painful. Or did the man made a mistake while using his ability? Hawfor yelled with a sense of being terrified. “F*ck. Don’t use Berserker without saying a word! I don’t want to die yet. I get it, drain the flagship’s energy right? Team China’s leader, just you wait. I will show you the terror of the Goro Goro no Mi. Hahaha.” He laughed out as he charged toward the exit of the room. Zheng watched Hawfor ran out of the room quietly. His attention was focused on Richard. As Richard’s muscle stopped wriggling, a peculiar pressure formed between him and Zheng. This prevented Zheng from attacking the Caucasian. He was staying cautious and was prepared to use Explosion at any moment. Richard raised his head to look at Zheng again. What Zheng saw was a pair of bloody eyes. The only emotion left in those eyes was an insane thirst for blood. Richard’s conscious and self restrain were completely gone. He kicked the floor to jump forward. It created a small pit on the alloy floor. Zheng could feel the trembling from the floor. The ten meters of distance in between them was closed in an instant. The axe was hacking down at him realized it. (Can’t back! This speed is almost on par with my speed in Explosion. His strength even surpasses it. Isn’t this a mutation to Explosion?) This thought flashed across his mind then he raised Tiger\u0027s Soul at the double bladed axe. Zheng thought to himself that the axe was probably a magical item but the sharpness from the light blade should cut it in half. However, the result wasn’t what he had expected. Richard’s movements seemed crazy but it wasn’t actually so. His movements were much more acute. He rotated the axe slightly right before the two weapons came in contact. The axe hit the side of Tiger\u0027s Soul, pushing it off path. Then it slid along the blade of Tiger\u0027s Soul into Zheng’s arm and cut a long opening. Zheng had entered the second stage. He saw Richard waving the axe toward his head after the cut and jumped up. He gave a kick at Richard’s chest before the axe hit him and sent Richard back several meters. He also used the momentum to back off, increasing the distance between them. A stream of blood gushed out from his chest. Tiger’s Soul was pushed to the side just then but the light blade still cut an opening on Richard’s chest. It didn’t cut him in two but it damaged his organs. There should be a large cut on his lungs. Richard didn’t even take a look at the wound. It seemed like he didn’t even feel it. He raised the axe and charged at Zheng again. His speed and strength became stronger with the injury and loss of blood. Zheng could keep up with his previous speed in the unlocked mode but the speed now surpassed him. He only had the chance hold Tiger\u0027s Soul in front to block the axe. A hit from the axe knocked him into the wall. Richard continued hacking at him before he could act. Dozens of hits in just a few seconds. The force broke the alloy wall and blasted Zheng through. Zheng was still holding Tiger\u0027s Soul but the webbing between his thumb and index finger cracked. The axe also had ice attribute. A thick layer of ice formed on the cut on his arm and inhibited his flexibility. Tiger\u0027s Soul was also covered with ice from the impact. Seeing that Richard charged at him again, Zheng gave a shout and activated Explosion.
