{"id":42870,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. A SCAMP ON HIS DIGNITY.","content":"\"THIS yere is the mean chap that done it all,\" continued the trapper. \"Thar\u0027s none of us that\u0027ll ever see Frank ag\u0027in. He\u0027s gone round on t\u0027other side of the \u0027arth, an\u0027 some dark night, when he\u0027s sailin\u0027 along thinkin\u0027 of nothing, one of them big quids (the sailors had called the cuttle-fish \u0027squids\u0027) will rise outen the water all on a sudden, wrap his arms, two hundred feet long, all about the ship, an\u0027 that\u0027ll be the last of Frank. When be you goin\u0027 to hang this feller, cap\u0027n?\" Dick had an interested and anxious crowd of listeners. The officers of the schooner and the boys stood ranged in a circle in front of him, and behind were the sailors, who at first invaded the sacred precincts[100] of the quarter-deck with much hesitation, holding their caps in their hands and momentarily expecting an order to retire; but growing bolder by degrees, when they found that the captain, although he looked their way now and then, had nothing to say to them, they crowded up close behind the trapper, so that they could hear every word. There were also two other listeners—the men with the bludgeons, who had followed Dick Lewis in the hope of rescuing his prisoner. When these two worthies first came up, they acted as if they were about to board the vessel without ceremony; but changed their minds when they saw half a dozen broad-shouldered seamen, in obedience to a sign from the officer of the deck, move up into the waist to receive them. The sailors, who had a pretty good idea of what had been going on, even before they had heard the trapper\u0027s story, would have been delighted to have the opportunity to toss these men ashore neck and heels; and the latter must have seen it in their countenances, for they backed away from the edge of the wharf and took up a position from which they could[101] hear and see all that passed on the Stranger\u0027s deck. Had Frank been as safe out of his troubles as Dick Lewis was, the boys would have been highly amused by the latter\u0027s description of the scenes through which he had passed; but it was far from being a laughing matter now. Frank had been kidnapped (\"shanghaied\" the sailors called it) by the captain of the Tycoon or his agent, and there was no knowing what might become of him. Perhaps the hard fare and harder treatment he was certain to receive, might drive him to do something desperate. Uncle Dick Gaylord, however, was not troubled by any such misgivings. He knew that Frank possessed courage and prudence in no ordinary degree, and besides there were Lucas and Barton, the coxswain, on the same vessel. The former was an old whaleman, and the assistance he could render Frank in the way of teaching him his duties, might enable the boy to keep out of any very serious difficulties. But could he help him in any way? That was the momentous question, and Uncle[102] Dick walked up and down his quarter-deck with his hands behind his back while he pondered upon it. \"Every word this man has uttered, as far as it concerns me and my doings, is false from head to tail,\" declared the bogus captain. This was the first time he had spoken since he was brought on board the vessel. At first he was badly frightened, but while the trapper was telling his story, he had time to think over his situation and determine upon his line of defence. \"I don\u0027t know anything about this man and the other fellow he speaks of,\" he continued; \"I never seen him before this morning, and I never tried to pass myself off as the captain of any ship.\" Dick Lewis eyed him savagely while he was speaking, and when he ceased drew back his clenched hand. In a moment more the man would have measured his length on the deck, had not the captain interposed. \"Get ashore!\" said he, shortly. \"O no, cap\u0027n,\" replied the man, with an impudent smile. \"This is a nice way you have of doing[103] business, I do think! One of your friends commits an assault on me and drags me away from my peaceful home, and then you wash your hands of the matter by telling me to go ashore. That won\u0027t go down, by no means. Twenty dollars for damages will get rid of me, but not a cent less!\" \"I can bring a dozen witnesses to prove that that man wasn\u0027t once outside of his house last night,\" said one of the ruffians on the dock. \"I\u0027m one of \u0027em, for I was with him all the evening and know everything he done.\" \"Rodgers!\" exclaimed Uncle Dick. \"Here, sir,\" came the prompt response. A stalwart sailor stepped quickly out from among his companions, and dashing his cap upon the deck stood behind the bogus captain pushing back his sleeves. A simple look from Uncle Dick would have sent the man flying over the schooner\u0027s side as if he had been thrown from a catapult. \"This is the last time I shall speak to you,\" continued Uncle Dick. \"Get ashore!\" The bogus captain thought it best to obey, and[104] that too without a moment\u0027s hesitation. Once on the dock he was safe, and there he stopped long enough to say a parting word to Uncle Dick. \"This matter will be settled in the court-room,\" said he, with a threatening shake of his head. \"That man shall be arrested before he is an hour older.\" With these words he walked off, followed by his companions. The boys looked first at him, then at the captain and finally at Dick Lewis, who stood the very picture of astonishment. \"Why didn\u0027t you set the law a-goin\u0027?\" the trapper managed to ask at last. \"It would have been of no use,\" answered the master of the schooner. \"Didn\u0027t you hear what that man on the dock said? That indicated the defence they would bring up. We would find a court-room full of witnesses to prove an alibi—that is, that this man was somewhere else when the kidnapping was done.\" \"But it wouldn\u0027t be true, Uncle Dick,\" said Archie, who, like all the rest of the Club, invariably addressed the old sailor by this affectionate title. \"If they swore to that, they would be guilty of perjury,[105] and that is a state prison offence. Dick has told the truth.\" \"I know it. I am just as certain that everything he has described to us really happened, as I would be had I seen it all with my own eyes; but a justice would not take his unsupported word against that of a dozen men. And as for perjury, how would you fasten the crime upon these false witnesses that would be produced? If Frank, Lucas and Barton were here, we would have the game in our own hands; but they are miles away. This man knows we can prove nothing, and that is what makes him so impudent.\" \"I wish you had told Rodgers to throw him overboard, or else let Dick knock him down,\" said Eugene. \"And afterward had the satisfaction of paying a fine and costs,\" said the old sailor, with a laugh. \"By the time your hair is as white as mine, Eugene, perhaps you will have learned something. I\u0027ve got one fine to pay now.\" \"Why, how is that?\" asked all the boys at once. [106] \"Didn\u0027t you hear what that man said just as he went away? There\u0027ll be a policeman down here directly.\" The boys looked toward the trapper. The expression of alarm which they had so often seen of late, had settled on his face again. He backed up against the rail for support, and looked wildly about as if he had half a mind to take to his heels. He stood more in fear of the law than he did of a grizzly bear. He had always thought that there was something wrong about it, and now he was firmly convinced of the fact. The law, as he understood it, was to restrain bad people, who were disposed to take advantage of their neighbors whenever an opportunity was offered; but he found that it was likely to prove a means of punishment to the innocent. It would have been just as impossible to give him a clear idea of its workings, as it would to make him understand the causes of the trade-winds or the theory of the ocean-currents. \"I\u0027ve said a million times, an\u0027 Frank says that more\u0027n a thousand, that I\u0027d never put my old moccasins[107] inside a city again, an\u0027 now I say it onct more an\u0027 I\u0027ll stick to it,\" said the trapper, solemnly, raising his hand toward the mast-head to give emphasis to his words. \"I get skeared to death by cars an\u0027 steamboats, an\u0027 something\u0027s allers happenin\u0027.\" \"Shoulder your rifle an\u0027 kit, Dick, an\u0027 let\u0027s be off,\" said old Bob, who up to this time had been a silent and amazed spectator and listener. \"I\u0027m afeared.\" \"So am I, Bob, but I dasen\u0027t. I dasen\u0027t go; the law will ketch me. I wish I was to the ole Bar\u0027s Hole, so\u0027t I could crawl in an\u0027 hide myself.\" Dick leaned back against the rail again, rubbing his hands together and groaning as men sometimes do when they are sadly troubled in spirit. The boys tried hard to set his mind at rest. They assured him that no harm should come to him, for they and Uncle Dick were not only able but ready and willing to stand between him and all difficulties; but the trapper said he didn\u0027t want them to do it. If anybody was to go to jail (thrusting people into jail and hanging them Dick thought were the only punishments[108] in vogue in civilized communities) it should be himself and nobody else. Furthermore, he did not see why it was necessary that any one should be called upon to stand between him and difficulty. He had only been following out his natural impulses in trying to bring the bogus captain to justice, and now he must suffer for it. He shook his head, refusing to be comforted, and showed a desire to be alone with his own thoughts; so the boys left him and turned to Uncle Dick, who was once more pacing his quarter-deck, after holding a short consultation with his officers. \"I know what you want,\" said the old sailor, as the boys approached him in a body. \"You are anxious to know what I am going to do for Frank. I can only guess at the best plan, and follow it out to the best of my judgment. What do you think ought to be done?\" The boys had no suggestions to offer. One thing was certain, and that was that Frank would not long submit to harsh treatment. A young man who had commanded a fine vessel in Uncle Sam\u0027s navy would[109] not consent to take rank next below the captain\u0027s dog, as the sailors in the Tycoon\u0027s forecastle had assured him he would do as long as he remained in that ship. If the opportunity were ever offered, he would lay his case before the consul of the first port at which the vessel touched; and failing that he would probably be driven to desert. In either case the boys did not expect to see him again. If the consul protected him, he would be sent to the nearest port in the United States free of expense, and he had money enough in his pocket—about twenty dollars, Archie thought—to support him until he could receive a remittance from home. If he was compelled to desert he would probably ship on the first vessel he could find, just as Chase had done, and she might take him to the remotest corner of the earth. All this would sadly interfere with the Club\u0027s arrangements. They thought as much of Frank as his cousin did—so much that they one and all declared that they did not care to continue their voyage without him. They couldn\u0027t enjoy themselves, for they would worry about him all the[110] while, and if they were to be separated from him they would rather go home and stay there. If their pleasant party and their cruise were to be broken up, they had the boarding-house keeper to thank for it, and Walter declared that there was no punishment known to the law half severe enough for him. Uncle Dick listened while the boys were talking, and said he fully agreed with them. \"Even if Frank should succeed in escaping from the Tycoon, and had a vessel at his command or money enough to take him just where he wanted to go, he would not know which way to steer to find us,\" said he, \"for you boys will remember that you did not decide upon anything definite, and Frank doesn\u0027t know whether we are going to Alaska or Japan.\" \"And all through my foolishness,\" said Eugene, bitterly. \"I wish I had given up, and gone where the others wanted to go.\" \"So do I,\" said Bab. \"Don\u0027t reproach yourselves,\" replied Uncle Dick. \"You had plenty of sport during your debates, and you were not supposed to know that such an emergency[111] as this was about to arise. But perhaps we can do something by following the Tycoon.\" \"Yes, if we only knew where she is going.\" \"I have an idea that I do know. She is bound for the Japan station, so the sailors in her forecastle told Dick Lewis. Well, now, she is short-handed. She must be, for her mate released Dick from his irons and brought him on deck to help make sail. She\u0027ll never go on her station without a full crew, and the nearest place at which she can get it is the Sandwich Islands. There she will undoubtedly ship Kanakas enough to make up her complement. Then she\u0027ll go out for a three or four months\u0027 cruise, and come back and fit out for the Japan station. Now, if we can reach Honolulu before she leaves, we shall probably be able to effect the release of our men. If it were not for this incident that has just happened I would sail at once.\" \"Why can\u0027t you do it any way?\" asked Walter, who did not like to waste even a moment. \"Because we must see Lewis out of his trouble. If he goes ashore without some one to protect him,[112] he will be sure to fall into the hands of those sharpers, who will frighten him out of the last article of value he\u0027s got.\" \"Cap\u0027n,\" said Dick, suddenly, \"will you take us with you—me and Bob?\" The old sailor looked in astonishment, and so did the boys. \"I\u0027m afeared to go ashore,\" continued the trapper, who had been holding a council of war with his chum, \"an\u0027 so is Bob. \u0027Sides it\u0027s a thing we never done yet—run off an\u0027 leave Frank in trouble, an\u0027 we\u0027ve knowed him too long to do it now!\" \"My good fellow,\" said Uncle Dick, with a smile, \"if Frank were lost in the woods, you and Bob would be just the men to assist him; but you can\u0027t help him in any way now.\" \"Mebbe we can, cap\u0027n. An\u0027 even if we can\u0027t, we don\u0027t want to go back hum without knowing what\u0027s come on him. We shouldn\u0027t see no peace of mind.\" Uncle Dick did not speak for several minutes. He knew just how much these rude men thought of Frank, and told himself that their desire to see him[113] safe among friends again before they took leave of him for ever, was perfectly natural; but there were the dangers they expected to meet on the \"under side of the earth\"—the Flying Dutchman, the whales, the monstrous \"quids\"—could they stand all these? \"Lewis,\" said he, suddenly, \"have you and your companion fully made up your minds on this point?\" \"Yes, an\u0027 we won\u0027t never change \u0027em nuther. We allers stand to what we say.\" \"That settles the matter. Mr. Baldwin, while I am gone to the custom house, hail the first tug you see and stand by to get under way.\" The boys would have been delighted by this arrangement a few hours before, but their feelings were different now. They had something to think of besides the amusement they expected the trappers to furnish them. Uncle Dick went ashore and walked rapidly away, leaving the boys to themselves. Although they were impatient to be off, the time did not hang heavily[114] on their hands, for they had much to talk about. They fully expected the trappers to change their minds when they saw the preparations that were being made for getting under way, but Dick and Bob were not that sort. There was a dogged expression on their faces, such as might have been seen there had the backwoodsmen been in the power of savage foes who were making ready to torture them at the stake. It said that they fully realized the dangers before them, and were prepared to meet them like men who had never shown the white feather. \"Now, if Frank were only here, and if Dick and Bob would get rid of some of their foolish notions, we could look forward to some fun, couldn\u0027t we?\" said Eugene. \"If and if!\" said Walter. \"It is surprising how often that little word stands in our way.\" \"I have been thinking that Dick\u0027s short sojourn on the Tycoon has made matters worse for Frank than they would otherwise have been,\" said Bob, anxiously. \"The three principal officers have felt[115] the weight of his arm, and of course they\u0027ll have to take satisfaction out of somebody.\" \"Dick,\" said Archie, suddenly, \"why don\u0027t you encourage us by saying that Frank will be sure to come out all right? That\u0027s what you used to tell us whenever he got into trouble.\" \"But he was on the prairie then, an\u0027 now he\u0027s among civilized folks,\" replied the trapper. \"Which means, I suppose, that this is the worst scrape he ever got into.\" Dick nodded his head. \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" said George Le Dell. \"I think if he had his choice, he would rather be where he is now than in the prison at Shreveport, if he had to go through what he did when he made his escape. Frank has been in some tight places, but somehow he has always managed to squeeze through without much trouble.\" \"And he never was hurt that I remember, except when he burned that house in which Colonel Harrison made his headquarters,\" said Archie. \"When you burned it, you mean,\" said George.[116] \"You did that, and if you had been a line instead of a staff officer, you would have got another stripe around your arm for it, too. I told the Colonel all about it after you left our house.\" \"Why did you do that?\" exclaimed Archie, hastily. \"Now I shall never dare to meet him again.\" \"Ha! ha!\" laughed George. \"Why, he is one of your warmest friends. I told him because I wanted him to know that the boy who killed that bear and beat Somers in a fair race through the woods, had something in him. The Colonel scolded me for not telling him before. He said if he had known it while you were in our neighborhood, you wouldn\u0027t have got away from his house for one good long month at least. He would have kept you if he\u0027d had to put a guard over you.\" \"Well, I shouldn\u0027t have enjoyed the visit.\" \"You couldn\u0027t have helped yourself, if plenty of hunting, riding and good company are aids to enjoyment.\" From this subject the boys gradually got back to[117] the one that occupied the most of their minds and thoughts, and that was Frank\u0027s sudden disappearance. They asked the trapper a multitude of questions, but learned nothing new, for he had already told his story in detail. While they were talking Uncle Dick returned, and the tug being alongside and the pilot aboard, the lines were cast off and the Stranger swung slowly around until her bow pointed toward the headlands at the entrance to the bay. In the bustle and hurry that followed the boys found time to turn an eye toward the trappers now and then, but they saw no signs of regret or alarm on their faces; and when the lines that held the tug were let go, and the steamer with a farewell shriek of her whistle turned back toward the city, and the schooner unfolded her white wings one after the other, and the Golden Gate was passed, and the broad expanse of the Pacific was fairly spread out before them, there were still no signs of backing out. But it was too late now. The die was cast, and Dick and old Bob were bound for the \"under side of the earth!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1671/49249.html","bookId":1190,"book":{"id":1190,"title":"Frank Nelson in the Forecastle","description":"简介： We certainly did.
