{"id":42866,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. \"MAN OVERBOARD.\"","content":"THE trappers were badly frightened, there could be no doubt about that, and it was a spectacle the Club had never expected to witness. That these two men, who had time and again faced death in almost every shape in which he presents himself on shore, who had lived in the very midst of danger from their youth up, and who sought and delighted in perilous exploits, should be so nearly overcome with terror by hearing of things with which every schoolboy is familiar, was surprising; and there was something so ludicrous in the manner in which they exhibited their alarm, that the boys could scarcely restrain their laughter until they could get out of sight. Old Bob glared wildly about him, seemingly on the point of jumping overboard and swimming[25] ashore, and Dick Lewis leaned against the rail, drawing his breath in quick gasps and looking altogether as if he did not yet fairly understand the startling discovery he had made. Uncle Dick Gaylord took one glance at him and then went to the stern and looked over into the water, while the boys dived down into the cabin and threw themselves into chairs, or leaned up in corners, holding their handkerchiefs over their mouths—all except Archie, who never could control himself when he wanted to laugh. He ran into his state-room, shut the door and buried his head in the pillows. The funny part of it was, that Dick should suppose, that those who attempted the reckless task of sailing around the world, should be obliged to take a magnet with them, in order to keep themselves and their vessel from falling off when they reached the \"under side of the earth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At the end of five minutes Archie made an attempt to come out into the cabin, but he was still bubbling over with laughter, and the sight of him created a fresh explosion, and set Archie himself to[26] going again at such a rate that he was obliged to go back. It is hard to tell how long it would have been before the boys could have controlled themselves sufficiently to talk the matter over, had it not been that a commotion which suddenly arose on deck, drew their attention to other affairs. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fore rigging, there,\" exclaimed Uncle Dick. \"What do you see?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A man overboard, sir,\" replied the voice of the boatswain\u0027s mate. \"He jumped off that whaler, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And he\u0027s swimming this way, sir,\" said another voice, \"and making signals of distress.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have the cutter called away, Mr. Baldwin,\" said Uncle Dick, to his first mate, \"and send a crew out to pick him up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys waited to hear no more. They crowded up the companion ladder with such haste that they ran some risk of sticking fast in the narrow passageway, and reached the deck just as the crew of the cutter were tumbling into their boat which lay along side moored to a swinging boom, man-of-war fashion. \\n\\n \\n\\n [27] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where is Mr. Parker?\" said Uncle Dick, looking around for his second officer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, let me go in charge of the boat, Uncle,\" exclaimed Eugene, snatching Fred\u0027s hat from his head, for he had left his own in the cabin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Away you go, then,\" said the old sailor. \"Don\u0027t let him sink before you reach him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re sending out a boat from the whaler, sir,\" said the foremast hand, who was at work in the forward rigging, and who had been the first to discover the man in the water. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does he appear to be all right?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, yes, sir. He swims like a duck, but he\u0027s waving his hand to us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hold on a minute, Eugene.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Uncle Dick sprang upon the rail and supporting himself by the shrouds looked towards the man, and then toward the boat that was coming out to pick him up, while the boys, all except Eugene, who stood ready to take his place in the cutter at a moment\u0027s warning, swarmed up the rigging and looked on with no little interest. They saw at once that[28] the man had no trouble in keeping afloat, for he swam over the waves as buoyantly as a cork. They saw, too, that he did not want to be overtaken by the whaler\u0027s boat, if he could help it, for he looked back at her occasionally to see if she was gaining on him, and then redoubled his efforts to reach the schooner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is trying to desert,\" said Uncle Dick, \"and I think we had better have nothing to do with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quartermaster, pass up that spy-glass,\" said Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n The petty officer handed the instrument to Featherweight, who happened to be lowest in the shrouds, and he passed it to George Le Dell, who handed it up to Frank. The latter mounted to the crosstrees and levelled the glass at the swimmer. He held it to his eye for a few minutes, and then passing it back to George, said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That man has either met with a severe accident, or been roughly handled. His face is bleeding.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Help! help!\" cried a faint voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n [29] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go and pick him up,\" said Uncle Dick. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shove off,\" commanded Eugene, before he was fairly seated in the stern-sheets of the cutter. \"Remember, men, that you are racing with a whale-boat, and that you don\u0027t want to be beaten.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The cutter swung around with her bow toward the swimmer, and propelled by eight strong oarsmen, who seemed to lift her fairly out of the water at every stroke, flew over the waves like a duck. A boat race was something in which Eugene took especial delight, but the one that came off that morning between the cutter and the whale-boat was not as exciting or as closely contested as he had hoped it would be. In fact it was no race at all; for when the officer, whoever he was, who had charge of the deck of the whaler, saw that the cutter was likely to reach the swimmer first, he hailed his boat, which turned around and went back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In bow,\" commanded the coxswain of the cutter, who was sitting just behind Eugene. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two sailors who were seated in the bow raised their oars from the water, placed them on the[30] thwarts between them, and then one stood up with the boat-hook in his hand, while the other threw himself flat on his face and extended his arm out over the water. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Way enough! Toss, and stand by,\" said the coxswain. \\n\\n \\n\\n The other oars were all thrown up into the air at the same moment, laid upon the thwarts, and every man leaned over the side to be ready to seize the swimmer as the cutter moved past him. She retained steerage-way enough to carry her within a few feet of him, and then the coxswain, with one movement of the tiller, turned the bow aside, and the boat-hook was thrust out within reach of his hands. It was a matter of some difficulty to haul the rescued man aboard, for he was too nearly exhausted to help himself, and his clothing, being thoroughly saturated with water, was as heavy as so much lead. Besides, his forehead was badly cut and bruised, and no doubt he was suffering from the hurt. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rescuing the Deserter. \\n\\n \\n\\n [31] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you fall overboard?\" asked Eugene, after the man had been pulled into the boat and had taken his seat in the bow. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir; I jumped overboard on purpose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You hit your head against something, didn\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The cap\u0027n hit it for me, sir. It was a belaying pin that made that mark.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Eugene looked wonderingly at the coxswain, who nodded his head, as if to say that he didn\u0027t doubt it at all. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, the officers aboard our vessel don\u0027t find it necessary to do such things,\" said Eugene. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But all vessels ain\u0027t like the Stranger, sir, nor are all shipmasters like Cap\u0027n Gaylord,\" said the coxswain. \"Do you s\u0027pose there\u0027s a sailorman aboard of us that would do what this chap has done—try to desert? No, sir, you couldn\u0027t kick \u0027em off if you wanted to. When we get back to Bellville we\u0027ll have every man we brought away with us, unless some of \u0027em are in Davy\u0027s locker.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The cutter was soon alongside the schooner, and the rescued man, by dint of hauling from above and[32] pushing from below, was got upon the deck. He was a pitiable object when one came to look at him, and Uncle Dick\u0027s first order was: \"Take him below, some of you, and give him something fit to put on. Be in a hurry about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The sailors were only too glad to obey. They led the dripping man into the forecastle, from which he emerged a few minutes later with a clean face, a suit of dry clothes, and a handkerchief bound about his forehead. In his appearance, which was very much improved, he would have compared favorably with any of the seamen on board the Stranger, and they were the very best that Uncle Dick could find in the port of New Orleans. He had evidently had plenty of time to tell at least a portion of his story, for the faces of the sailors were as black as so many thunder clouds. \\n\\n \\n\\n The rescued man at once made his way aft, accompanied by the boatswain\u0027s mate, who, presuming for this once upon his captain\u0027s good-nature, and his own position as ranking petty officer on board the Stranger, took the liberty to go where he knew he[33] had no right except he was in performance of his duties. The men saluted, removed their caps and waited for Uncle Dick to speak to them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Lucas, what do you want here?\" asked the old sailor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ax your pardon, cap\u0027n, for coming on the quarter-deck at this time without an invite,\" replied the boatswain\u0027s mate, \"but I just wanted to say to you, sir, that this man is black and blue from his head to his feet, so he is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did he get that way?\" asked Uncle Dick, while the boys ranged themselves behind him so that they could hear all that passed, \"and why is he trying to desert?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The mate stepped back and moved his hand toward the rescued man, as if to say that he would tell his own story, and the latter said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to desert my ship, cap\u0027n. I am an able seaman, know my duty and am ready to do it, if I can only have plenty to eat and am allowed a wink of sleep now and then. I am trying to get ashore for protection ag\u0027in\u0027 them tyrants aboard the[34] Tycoon, and I hope you won\u0027t send me back to them, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go on,\" said Uncle Dick. \"What has happened aboard that ship?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is nearly two years out of Nantucket, on a whaling course, sir,\" said the man, \"and there isn\u0027t a foremast hand aboard of her that she brought out with her. They\u0027ve all deserted. She has to get a new crew at every port, and when she can\u0027t get \u0027em honest, she kidnaps \u0027em, sir. I shipped aboard of her, along with a lot of others, at Callao. We\u0027ve been out only four months, and two of the men jumped overboard rather than stand the hard treatment they received. On the first day out the officers began on us and never let up. They kept us at work till we were ready to drop, brought us out of bed at night and made us walk the deck, and if we fell asleep as we walked, they knocked us down with a handspike or belaying-pin. They starved us almost to death, and then, because my boat\u0027s crew were too weak to save a whale we made[35] fast to, they put us all in irons and pounded us with ropes\u0027 ends till we were insensible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was only the introduction to the long story the man had to tell, and to which his auditors listened with breathless interest. According to his account, the Tycoon was a horrible place, and the cruelties that were practised by the officers upon the defenceless seamen, were shocking. The man certainly bore unmistakable evidence of brutal treatment, and added weight to his story by declaring that he was not only willing but anxious to meet his persecutors in a court of justice. Everybody who listened to him was indignant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The men on board that vessel have a remedy in their own hands—two of them, if they only knew it,\" said Frank. \"Why didn\u0027t they demand an interview with the American consul at the first port at which they touched?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It wouldn\u0027t have done no good, sir,\" said the sailor. \"The cap\u0027n wouldn\u0027t never let \u0027em see him, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He couldn\u0027t help himself,\" returned Frank.[36] \"The law compels him to allow his men to go ashore at every port at which the ship may touch to lay their complaints, if they have any, before our representative; or, if there is any good reason why the men cannot go ashore, the captain must bring the consul aboard to see them, if they demand it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n If there was anything in which Frank was particularly well posted, it was the law governing the duties of consuls, as some of our representatives in foreign countries are called. The attorney with whom he had been studying in Lawrence, had political aspirations, and had at one time expected to be appointed consul for some port in the Mediterranean. If he had succeeded in his object Frank would have gone with him as assistant and clerk. He did not wish to accept any situation with whose duties and responsibilities he was not familiar, and in order to fit himself for it, he had obtained a copy of the Consular Regulations, which he had thoroughly mastered. It is a part of the consul\u0027s duty to care for destitute, discharged and deserting seamen, to[37] stand between foremast hands and tyrannical officers, to protect officers from and punish mutinous sailors, and Frank knew the law bearing upon every case that could possibly arise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The consul is obliged to listen to any and all complaints,\" continued Frank. \"He measures them by the law bearing upon them, and he can discharge the crew on complaint of the officers, or he can discharge the officers themselves on a well-founded complaint from the crew.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The sailors opened their eyes and looked at one another. They had never dreamed that they had so many rights, or that there was a law enacted on purpose to protect them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then the whale-boat came in sight again, rounding the stern of the Tycoon. She turned her bow toward the Stranger, and the quartermaster, after looking at her through his spy-glass, said there was a man in the stern-sheets dressed in gray. \"That\u0027s the cap\u0027n,\" exclaimed the deserter, in great alarm. \"You won\u0027t let him take me back, sir?\" he added, in a pleading voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n [38] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t prevent your lawful captain from taking you wherever he may find you,\" answered Uncle Dick; \"but hold on, now, till I get through,\" he added, as the man began to back toward the rail as if he were about to take to the water again. \"I\u0027ll give you a chance to save yourself. Call away the cutter, Mr. Baldwin, and send this man ashore.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, cap\u0027n, thank you,\" said the sailor gratefully, and with tears in his eyes. \"A prosperous and pleasant voyage to you and your mates, sir. What shall I do when I get ashore, sir?\" he continued, looking at Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go to the nearest justice and take out a warrant against those officers for assault and battery,\" was the reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n The boatswain\u0027s mate and the rescued man looked as if they did not quite understand. \"You must know, sir,\" said the latter, doubtfully, \"that all this beating and pounding was done on the high seas.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, what of it? When one man, without any provocation, handles another as roughly as you[39] have been handled, he is answerable to the law, no matter whether the offence was committed on the high seas or on the land.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come now, off you go, my man,\" said Uncle Dick. \"The cutter is ready, and you\u0027ve no time to lose. Yes, go with him and take charge of the boat, Lucas,\" he added, anticipating the request that the old boatswain\u0027s mate was about to make. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And whatever you do, don\u0027t let those blubber-hunters catch you,\" said Eugene, in a low voice. He wanted to say it aloud, so that the cutter\u0027s crew could hear it; but knowing that Uncle Dick did not allow any interference with his men, he checked himself just in time. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cutter\u0027s crew were all in their places, and there was a determined look on each man\u0027s face which said as plainly as words that the \"blubber-hunters,\" even if they succeeded in overhauling them—which was not at all unlikely, seeing that the whale-boat was built for speed, and was pulled by a crew who were kept in excellent training by almost daily practice at the oars—the deserter[40] should never be taken from them. Uncle Dick seemed to read the thoughts that were passing through their minds, and as he looked at the sturdy fellows, who had thrown off their caps and rolled up their sleeves in preparation for a long, hard pull, he remarked to Frank that he would not care to be in that whale-boat if she succeeded in coming up with the cutter. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1671/49245.html","bookId":1190,"book":{"id":1190,"title":"Frank Nelson in the Forecastle","description":"简介： We certainly did.
