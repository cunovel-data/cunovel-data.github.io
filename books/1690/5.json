{"id":64284,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"THE LIQUIDATION OF ANACHRONISMS\\n\\n ALMOST before Jane had finished putting clean sheets on Mark\u0027s bed, Mrs. Dimble arrived. \"You\u0027re an angel to have me,\" she said. \"We\u0027d tried every hotel in Edgestow I believe. All full up with the hangers-on and camp followers of this detestable N.I.C.E. Secretaries here- typists there-commissioners of works-the thing\u0027s outrageous. If Cecil hadn\u0027t had a room in College I really believe he\u0027d have had to sleep in the waiting-room at the station. I only hope that man in College has aired the bed.\"\\n\\n \"But what on earth\u0027s happened?\" asked Jane. \"Turned out, my dear!\"\\n\\n \"But it isn\u0027t possible, Mrs. Dimble. I mean, it can\u0027t be legal.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what Cecil said. . Just think of it, Jane. The first thing we saw when we poked our heads out of the window this morning was a lorry on the drive and a small army of what looked like criminals with picks and spades. There was an odious little man in a peaked cap who said they\u0027d have no objection to our remaining in possession (of the house, mind you, not the garden) till eight o\u0027clock tomorrow morning. No objection!\"\\n\\n \"But surely-surely-it must be some mistake.\"\\n\\n \"Of course Cecil rang up your Bursar. And of course your Bursar was out, and by that time the big beech had been cut down. At last Cecil did get Mr. Busby, who said there must be some misunderstanding, but it was out of his hands now, and we\u0027d better get on to the N.I.C.E. at Belbury. Of course it turned out to be quite impossible to get them. But by lunchtime we saw that one simply couldn\u0027t stay there.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"My dear, you\u0027ve no conception what it was like. Great lorries and traction engines roaring past all the time. Why, our own tradesmen couldn\u0027t get through it. The milk didn\u0027t arrive till eleven o\u0027clock. We\u0027d the greatest difficulty in getting into town ourselves. Flares and noise everywhere and the road practically ruined. And the people! Such horrid men. I didn\u0027t know we had workpeople like that in England.\"\\n\\n \"And what are you going to do?\" asked Jane.\\n\\n \"Heaven knows!\" said Mrs. Dimble.\"Cecil has been at Rumbold the solicitor\u0027s. Rumbold doesn\u0027t seem to know where he is. He keeps on saying the N.I.C.E. are in a very peculiar position legally. There\u0027s no question of trying to live on the far side of the river any longer, even if they\u0027d let us. All the poplars are going down. All those nice little cottages by the church are going down. I found poor Ivy-that\u0027s your Mrs. Maggs, you know-in tears. Poor things! They do look dreadful when they cry on top of powder. She\u0027s being turned out too; she\u0027s had enough troubles in her life without this. I was glad to get away. The men were so horrible. Three big brutes came to the back door asking for hot water and went on so that they frightened Martha out of her wits. A sort of special constable sent them away. What? Oh yes, there are dozens of what look like policemen all over the place, and I didn\u0027t like the look of them either. Cecil and I both thought the same thing: we thought it\u0027s almost as if we\u0027d lost the war. Oh, good girl, tea! That\u0027s just what I wanted.\"\\n\\n \"You must stay here as long as you like, Mrs. Dimble,\" said Jane. \"Mark\u0027ll just have to sleep in College.\"\\n\\n \"Well, really,\" said Mother Dimble, \"I feel at the moment that no Fellow of Bracton ought to be allowed to sleep anywhere! As a matter of fact, I shan\u0027t have to. Cecil and I are to go out to the Manor at St. Anne\u0027s. We have to be there so much at present, you see.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Jane involuntarily, as her own story flowed back on her mind.\\n\\n \"Why, what a selfish pig I\u0027ve been,\" said Mother Dimble. \"Here have I been quite forgetting that you\u0027ve been out there and are full of things to tell me. Did you see Grace? And did you like her?\"\\n\\n \"Is \u0027Grace\u0027 Miss Ironwood?\" asked Jane.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I saw her. I don\u0027t know if I liked her or not. But I don\u0027t want to talk about all that. I can\u0027t think about anything except this outrageous business of yours. It\u0027s you who are the real martyr, not me.\"\\n\\n \"No, my dear,\" said Mrs. Dimble, \"I\u0027m not a martyr. I\u0027m only an angry old woman with sore feet and a splitting head (but that\u0027s beginning to be better). After all, Cecil and I haven\u0027t lost our livelihood as poor Ivy Maggs has. It doesn\u0027t really matter leaving the old house, all those big rooms which we thought we should want because we were going to have lots of children, and then we never had. Jane, that\u0027s the third time you\u0027ve yawned. You\u0027re dropping asleep and I\u0027ve talked your head off. It comes of being married for thirty years. Husbands were made to be talked to. It helps them to concentrate on what they\u0027re reading.\"\\n\\n Jane found Mother Dimble an embarrassing person to share a room with because she said prayers. One didn\u0027t know where to look.\\n\\n \"Are you awake now?\" said Mrs. Dimble\u0027s voice, quietly, in the middle of the night.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Jane. \"I\u0027m so sorry. Did I wake you up? Was I shouting?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. You were shouting out about someone being hit on the head.\"\\n\\n \"I saw them killing a man . . .a man in a big car driving along a country road. Then he came to a crossroads and there was someone standing in the middle of the road waving a light to stop him. I couldn\u0027t hear what they said; I was too far away. They must have persuaded him to get out of the car somehow, and there he was talking to one of them. The light fell full on his face. He wasn\u0027t the same old man I saw in my other dream. He hadn\u0027t a beard, only a moustache. And he had a very quick, kind of proud, way. He didn\u0027t like what the man said to him and presently he put up his fists and knocked him down. Another man behind him tried to hit him on the head with something, but the old man was too quick and turned round in time. Then it was rather horrible, but rather fine. There were three of them at him and he was fighting them all. I\u0027ve read about that kind of thing in books, but I never realised how one would feel about it. Of course they got him in the end.\"\\n\\n \"Without a doubt,\" thought Mark, \"this must be the Mad Parson that Bill the Blizzard was talking of.\" The committee at Belbury did not meet till 10.30, and ever since breakfast he had been walking with the Reverend Straik in the garden, despite the raw and misty weather of the morning. At the very moment when the man had first buttonholed him, the threadbare clothes and clumsy boots, the frayed clerical collar, the dark, lean, tragic face, gashed and ill-shaved and seamed, and the bitter sincerity of his manner, had struck a discordant note. It was not a type Mark had expected to meet in the N.I.C.E.\\n\\n \"Do not imagine,\" said Mr. Straik, \"that I indulge in any dreams of carrying out our programme without violence. There will be resistance. They will gnaw their tongues and not repent. We face these disorders with a firmness which will lead traducers to say that we have desired them. In a sense we have. It is no part of our witness to preserve that organisation of ordered sin which is called Society.\"\\n\\n \"Now that is what I meant,\" said Mark, \" when I said that your point of view and mine must, in the long run, be incompatible. The preservation, which involves the thorough planning, of society is just precisely the end I have in view. I do not think there is or can be any other end. The problem is quite different for you because you look forward to something better than human society, in some other world.\"\\n\\n \"With every thought and vibration of my heart,\" said Mr. Straik, \"I repudiate that damnable doctrine. The Kingdom of God is to be realised here-in this world. And it will be. At the name of Jesus every knee shall bow.\\n\\n \"Bother!\" said Jane: and added, without much interest in the reply, \"What is she doing, do you know?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s gone out to St. Anne\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Has she got friends there?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s gone to the Manor, along with Cecil.\"\\n\\n \"Do you mean she\u0027s got a job there?\"\\n\\n \"Well, yes. I suppose it is a job.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Dimble left at about eleven. She also, it appeared, was going to St. Anne\u0027s, but was first to meet her husband and lunch with him at Northumberland. Jane walked down to the town with her and they parted at the bottom of Market Street. It was just after this that Jane met Mr. Curry.\\n\\n \"Have you heard the news, Mrs. Studdock?\" said Curry.\\n\\n \"No. What\u0027s wrong?\" said Jane. She thought Mr. Curry a pompous fool and Mark a fool for being impressed by him. But as soon as Curry began speaking her face showed all the wonder and consternation he could have wished. The murder of Hingest had already become Curry\u0027s property. The \"matter\" was, in some indefinable sense, \"in his hands\", and he was heavy with responsibility. At another time Jane would have found this amusing. She escaped from him as soon as possible and went into Blackie\u0027s for a cup of coffee. She felt she must sit down.\\n\\n The death of Hingest in itself meant nothing to her. But the certainty that she herself in her dream had witnessed a real murder shattered the consoling pretences with which she had begun the morning. It came over her with sickening clarity that the affair of her dreams, far from being ended, was only beginning. It would drive her mad, she thought, to face it alone. The other alternative was to go back to Miss Ironwood. But that seemed to be only a way of going deeper into all this darkness. She didn\u0027t want to get drawn in. It was unfair. It wasn\u0027t as if she had asked much of life. All she wanted was to be left alone.\\n\\n Cosser-the freckle-faced man with the little wisp of black moustache-approached Mark as he was coming away from the committee.\\n\\n \"You and I have a job to do,\" he said. \"Got to get out a report about Cure Hardy.\"\\n\\n Mark was very relieved to hear of a job. But he was a little on his dignity.\\n\\n \"Does that mean I am to be in Steele\u0027s department after all?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" said Cosser.\\n\\n \"The reason I ask,\" said Mark, \"is that neither he nor you seemed particularly keen on having me. I don\u0027t want to push myself in, you know. I don\u0027t need to stay at the N.I.C.E. at all if it comes to that.\"\\n\\n \"Well, don\u0027t start talking about it here,\" said Cosser. \"Come upstairs.\"\\n\\n They were in the hall and Mark noticed Wither pacing thoughtfully towards them. \"Wouldn\u0027t it be as well to speak to him?\" he suggested. But the Deputy Director, after coming within ten feet of them, had turned in another direction. He was humming to himself under his breath and seemed so deep in thought that Mark felt the moment unsuitable for an interview. Cosser apparently thought the same, and Mark followed him up to an office on the third floor.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s about the village of Cure Hardy,\" said Cosser, when they were seated. \"You see, all that land at Bragdon Wood is going to be little better than a swamp once they get to work. Why the hell we wanted to go there I don\u0027t know. Anyway, the latest plan is to divert the Wynd: block up the old channel through Edgestow altogether. Look. It\u0027s to be diverted and brought down an artificial channel-here, to the east, where the blue line is-and rejoin the old bed down here.\"\\n\\n \"The university will hardly agree to that,\" said Mark.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got the university by the short hairs,\" said Cosser. \"The point is that the new Wynd must come right through Cure Hardy in this narrow little valley. The idea is to dam the valley at the southern end and-make a big reservoir.\"\\n\\n \"But what happens to Cure Hardy?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s another advantage. We build a new model village four miles away.\"\\n\\n \"I say, there\u0027ll be the devil of a stink about this. Cure Hardy is famous. It\u0027s a beauty spot.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s where you and I come in. We\u0027ve got to make a report on Cure Hardy. We\u0027ll run out and have a look round to-morrow, but we can write most of the report today. It ought to be pretty easy. If it\u0027s a beauty spot, you can bet it\u0027s insanitary. Then we\u0027ve got to get out some facts about the population. I think you\u0027ll find it consists chiefly of undesirable elements-small rentiers and agricultural labourers.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s easy enough,\" said Mark, \"but before I get down to it I\u0027d like to be a bit clearer about my position. Oughtn\u0027t I to go and see Steele?\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t do that,\" said Cosser.\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Well, for one thing, Steele can\u0027t prevent you if the D.D. backs you up. For another, Steele is rather a dangerous man. There\u0027s another thing, too. I don\u0027t think things can go on in this department in the way they are at present.\"\\n\\n Mark understood. Cosser was hoping to get Steele out of the department altogether.\\n\\n \"I got the impression,\" said Mark, \"that you and Steele hit it off together rather well.\"\\n\\n \"The great thing here,\" said Cosser, \"is never to quarrel with anyone.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Mark. \"By the way, if-we go to Cure Hardy tomorrow I might as well run in to Edgestow and spend the night at home.\"\\n\\n For Mark a good deal hung on the answer to this. But Cosser merely said, \"Oh,\" leaving Mark in doubt whether no one needed leave of absence or whether Mark was not sufficiently established as a member of the Institute for his absence to be of any consequence. Then they went to work on their report.\\n\\n Next day they drove to Cure Hardy, and walked about the village for two hours and saw all the abuses and anachronisms they came to destroy. They saw the backward labourer and heard his views on the weather. They met the wastefully supported pauper shuffling across the courtyard of the alms-houses to fill a kettle, and the elderly rentier in conversation with the postman. It did not quite escape Mark that the face of the labourer was rather more interesting than Cosser\u0027s and his voice a great deal more pleasing to the ear. But all this did not influence his sociological convictions, for his education had had the effect of making things that he read and wrote more real to him than things he saw. Statistics about agricultural labourers were the substance: any real ditcher, ploughman, or farmer\u0027s boy, was the shadow. In his own way, he believed as firmly as any mystic in the superior reality of the things that are not seen.\\n\\n On their way back Cosser dropped him near Edgestow station, and as he walked home Mark began to think of what he would say to Jane about Belbury. You will misunderstand him if you think he was consciously inventing a lie; his misgiving and uneasiness quickened his desire to cut a good figure in the eyes of his wife. Almost without noticing it, he decided not to mention Cure Hardy; Jane cared for old buildings and all that sort of thing. When Jane heard the door opening and looked round and saw Mark, she saw a rather breezy Mark. Yes, he was almost sure he\u0027d got the job. The salary wasn\u0027t fixed, but he\u0027d be going into that to-morrow. But he had already got on to the real people there.\\n\\n Jane decided to tell him nothing about the dreams or St. Anne\u0027s. Men hated women who had things wrong with them, specially queer, unusual things. Her resolution was easily kept, for Mark full of his own story, asked her no questions. She was not, perhaps, entirely convinced by what he said. Very early in the conversation she said in a sharp, frightened voice (she had no idea how he disliked that voice), \"Mark, you haven\u0027t given up your Fellowship at Bracton?\" He said of course not, and went on.\\n\\n That evening the Fellows of Bracton sat in Common Room over their wine and dessert. Feverstone and Curry were sitting together. Until that night for about three hundred years this Common Room had been one of the pleasant quiet places of England, and at this hour and season the windows were, of course, shut and curtained. But from beyond them came such noises as had never been heard in that room before-shouts and curses and the sound of lorries heavily drumming past or harshly changing gear, rattling of chains, drumming of mechanical drills, clanging of iron, whistles, thuddings, and an all-pervasive vibration. Beyond those windows, scarcely thirty yards away on the other side of the Wynd, the conversion of an ancient woodland into an inferno of mud and steel and concrete was already going on. Several members even of the Progressive Element had already been grumbling about it. Curry was doing his best to brazen it out, and though his conversation with Feverstone had to be conducted at the top of their voices, he made no allusion to this inconvenience.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s quite definite, then,\" he bawled, \"that young Studdock is not coming back?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, quite,\" shouted Feverstone. \"When will he send a formal resignation?\"\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t an earthly!\"\\n\\n \"We must begin thinking about the vacancy at once.\"\\n\\n \"Does his successor have to be a sociologist? I mean is the Fellowship tied to the subject?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, not in the least. I say, Feverstone, oughtn\u0027t we to give this new subject a leg up?\"\\n\\n \"What new subject?\"\\n\\n \"Pragmatometry.\"\\n\\n \"Well, now, it\u0027s funny you should say that, because the man I was beginning to think of has been going in a good deal for pragmatometry. One could call it a fellowship in social pragmatometry, or something like that.\"\\n\\n \"Who is the man?\"\\n\\n \"Laird-from Leicester, Cambridge.\"It was automatic for Curry, though he had never heard of Laird, to say \"Ah, Laird. Just remind me of the details.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Feverstone, \"as you remember, he was in bad health at the time of his finals, and came rather a cropper. The Cambridge examining is so bad nowadays that one hardly counts that. He used to edit The Adult.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, to be sure. That Laird. But I say, Dick . . .\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not quite happy about his bad degree. Of course I don\u0027t attach a superstitious value to examination results any more than you do. Still . . . we have made one or two unfortunate elections lately.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to be at Cambridge next week,\" Feverstone said, \" in fact I\u0027m giving a dinner. I\u0027d as soon it wasn\u0027t mentioned here, because, as a matter of fact, the P.M. may be coming, and one or two big newspaper people and Tony Dew. What? Oh, of course you know Tony. That little dark man from the Bank. Laird is going to be there. He\u0027s some kind of cousin of the P.M.\u0027s. I was wondering if you could join us.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it would be very difficult. It rather depends on when old Bill\u0027s funeral is to be. Was there anything about the inquest on the six-o\u0027clock news?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t hear,\" yelled Feverstone. \"Is this noise getting worse? Or am I getting deaf?\"\\n\\n \"I say, Sub-Warden,\" shouted Ted Raynor from beyond Feverstone, \"what the devil are your friends outside doing?\"\\n\\n \"Listen!\" said Glossop suddenly, \"that\u0027s not work. Listen to the feet.\"\\n\\n Next moment nearly everyone in the room was on his feet. \"They\u0027re murdering someone,\" said Glossop. \"There\u0027s only one way of getting a noise like that out of a man\u0027s throat.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" asked Curry.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to see what\u0027s happening,\" said Glossop. \"I shouldn\u0027t go out if I were you,\" said Feverstone, \"it sounds as if the police, or something, was there already.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Listen. There!\"\\n\\n \"I thought that was their infernal drill.\"\\n\\n \"Listen!\"\\n\\n \"My God . . . you really think it\u0027s a machine-gun?\"\\n\\n \"Look out! Look out!\" said a dozen voices, as a splintering of glass became audible and a shower of stones fell on to the Common Room floor. A moment later several of the Fellows had made a rush for the windows and put up the shutters. Glossop had a cut on the forehead, and on the floor lay the fragments of that famous east window on which Henrietta Maria had once cut her name with a diamond. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/that-hideous-strength-space-trilogy-3/page-5.html","bookId":1690,"book":{"id":1690,"title":"That Hideous Strength (Space Trilogy #3)","description":"Storyline: That Hideous Strength (Space Trilogy #3) \\n The third novel in the science-fiction trilogy by C.S.
