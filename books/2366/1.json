The two men and the woman were dressed casually, attempting to blend in with the summer tourists strolling along the cobbled streets in the early morning, but it was difficult to remain inconspicuous in a place as small as the fortified village of St.-Paul-de-Vence. Harry Stanford had first noticed them because they were too casual, trying too hard not to look at him. Wherever he turned, one of them was in the background. Harry Stanford was an easy target to follow. He was six feet tall, with white hair lapping over his collar and an aristocratic, almost imperious face. He was accompanied by a strikingly lovely young brunette, a pure-white German shepherd, and Dmitri Kaminsky, a six-foot four-inch bodyguard with a bulging neck and sloping forehead. Hard to lose us, Stanford thought. He knew\u0027who had sent them and why, and he was filled with a sense of imminent danger. He had learned long ago to trust his instincts. Instinct and intuition had helped make him one of the wealthiest men in the world. Forbes magazine estimated the value of Stanford Enterprises at six billion dollars, while the Fortune 500 appraised it at seven billion. The Wall Street Journal, Barron\u0027s, and the Financial Tbnes had all done profiles on Harry Stanford, trying to explain his Mystique, his amazing sense of timing, the ineffable acu- men that had created the giant Stanfofd Enterprises. None had fully succeeded. What they all agreed on was that he had an almost palpable, manic energy. He was inexhaustible. His philosophy was simple: A day without making a deal was a day wasted. He wore, out his competitors, his staff, and everyone else who came in contact with him. He was a phenomenon, larger than life. He thought of himself as a religious man. He believed in God, and the God he believed in wanted him to be rich and successful, and his enemies dead, Harry Stanford was a public figure, and the press knew everything about him. Harry Stanford was a private figure, and the press knew nothing about him. They had written about his charisma, his lavish life-style, his private plane and his yacht, and his legendary homes in Hobe Sound, Morocco, Long Island, London, the South of France, and of course his 4 magnificent estate, Rose Hill, in the Back Bay area of Boston. But the real Harry Stanford remained an enigma. \u0027 are we going?\u0027 the woman asked. He was too preoccupied to answer. The couple on the other side of the street was using the cross-switch technique, and they had just changed partners again. Along with his sense of danger, Stanford felt a deep anger that they were invading his plivacy. They had dared come to him in this place, his secret haven from the rest of the world. St.-Paul-de-Vence is a picturesque, medieval village, weaving its ancient magic on a hilltop in the Alps Maritimes, situated inland between Cannes and Nice. it is surrounded by a spectacular and enchanting landscape of hills and valleys covered with flowers, orchards, and pine forests:-The village itself, a cornu- copia of artists\u0027 studios, galleries and wonderful antique shops, is a magnet for tourists from all over the world. Harry Stanford and his group turned onto the Rue Grande. Stanford turned to the woman Sophia, \u0027 you like museums?\u0027 4yes, caro.\u0027 She was eager to please him. She had never met anyone like Harry Stanford. Wait until I fell my giry\u0027friends about hbm I didn\u0027t think there was \u0027\u0027 anything left for me to learn about sex, but my God, he\u0027s so creative! He\u0027s wearing me out! They went up the hill to the Fondation maeght art museum, and browsed through its renowned collection Of Paintings by Bonnard and Chagall and many other contemporary artists. When Harry Stanford casually glanced around, he observed the woman at the other end Of the gallery, earnestly studying a Mir6. Stanford turned to Sophia. \"Hungry?\". If you are.\u0027 Must not be pushy. \u0027. We\u0027ll have lunch at La Colombe d\u0027Or.\u0027 La Colombe d\u0027Or was one of Stanford\u0027s favorite restaurants, a sixteenth-century house at the entrance to the old village, converted into a hotel and restaurant. Stanford and Sophia sat at a table in the garden, by the pool, where Stanford could admire the Braque and Calder. Prince, the white German shepherd, lay at his feet, ever watchful. The dog was Harry Stanford\u0027s trademark. Where Stanford went, Prince went. it was rumored that at Harry Stanford\u0027s command, the animal would tear out a person\u0027s throat. No one, wanted to test that rumor. Dmitri sat by himself at a table near the hotel entrance, carefully observing the other patrons as they came and went., Stanford turned to Sophia. \u0027 I order for you, my deart 611lease.1 Harry Stanford prided himself on being a gourmet. He ordered a green salad andfricass,6e de lotte for both of them. As they were being served their main course, Danielle Roux, who ran the hotel with her husband, Franr, ois, approached the table and smiled. \u0027. Is everything all right, Monsieur Stanfordt \u0027, Madame Roux.\u0027 And it was going to be. They are pygmies, trying to fell a giant. They\u0027re in for a big disappointment. Sophia said, \u0027\u0027ve never been here before. It\u0027s such a lovely village-\u0027 Stanford turned his attention to her. Dmitri had picked her up for him in Nice a day earlier. \u0027. Stanford, I brought someone for you.\" problemt. Stanford had asked. Dmitri had grinned. \u0027.\" He had seen her in the lobby of the Hotel Negresco, and had approached her. \u0027 me, do you speak English?\".\u0027 She had a lilting Italian accent. \u0027 man I work for would like you to have dinner with him.\u0027 She had been indignant. \u0027\u0027m not a puttana! I\u0027m an actress she had said haughtily. n fact, she had had a walk-on part in Pupi Avati\u0027s last film, and a role with two lines of dialogue in a Giuseppe Tornatore film. \u0027 would I have dinner with a stranger?\u0027 Dmitri had taken out a wad of hundred-dollar bills. He pushed five into her hand. \u0027 friend is very generous. He has a yacht, and he is lonely.\u0027 He had watched her expression go through a series of changes from indignation, to curiosity, to interest. \u0027 it happens, I\u0027m between pictures.\u0027 She smiled. \u0027 would probably do no harm to have dinner with your friend.\" \"Good. He will be pleased.\" is he?\".-Paul-de-Vence.\u0027 Dmitri had chosen well. Italian. In her late twenties. A sensuous, catlike face. Full-breasted figure. Now, looking at her across the table, Harry Stanford made a decision. \u0027 you like to travel, Sophia?\" adore it.\" \"Good. We\u0027ll go on a little trip. Excuse me a moment.\u0027 Sophia watched as he walked into the restaurant and to a public telephone outside the men\u0027s room. Stanford put ajeton in the slot and dialed. \u0027 operator, please.\u0027 Seconds later, a voice said, \u0027 lop6atrice maritime.\" want to put in a call to the yacht Blue Skies. Whiskey bravo lima nine eight zero ...\u0027 The conversation lasted five -minutes, and when Stanford was finished, he dialed the airport at Nice. The conversation was shorter this time. When Stanford was through talking, he spoke to Dmitri, who rapidly left the restaurant. Then he returned to Sophia. \u0027 you ready?\". \u0027\u0027s take a walk.\u0027 He needed time to work out a plan. It was a perfect day. The sun had splashed pink clouds across the horizon and\u0027rivers of silver light ran through the streets.. They strolled along the Rue Grande, past the tgjise, the beautiful twelfth-century church, and stopped at the boulangerie in front of [email protected] Arch to buy some fresh baked bread \u0027. When they came out, one of the three watchers \u0027 standing outside, busily studying the church. Dmitri was also waiting for them. Harry Stanford handed the bread to Sophia. \u0027 don\u0027t you take this up to the house? I\u0027ll be along in a few minutes! \u0027 right! She smiled and said softly, \u0027, caro! Stanford watched her leave, then motioned to Dm itri. \u0027 did you find ouff \"The woman and one of the men are staying at Le Hameau, on the road to La Colle! Harry Stanford knew the place.-. It was a whitewashed farmhouse with an orchard a mile west of St.-Paul-de-Vence. \u0027 the other onet \u0027 Le Mas d\u0027Artigny.\u0027 Le Mas d\u0027Artigny was a Provenw mansion on a hillside two miles west of St.-Paul-de-Vence. \u0027 do you want me to do with them, sirt \u0027. I\u0027ll take care of them.\u0027 Harry Stanford\u0027s villa was on the Rue de Casette, next to the mairie, in an area of narrow cobblestone streets and very old houses. The villa was a five-level house made of old stone and plaster. Two levels below the main house were a garage and an old cave used as a wine cellar. A stone staircase led to upstairs bedrooms, an office, and a tiled-roof terrace. The entire house was furnished in French antiques and filled with flowers. When Stanford returned to the villa, Sophia was in his bedroom, waiting for him. She was naked. \u0027 took you so long?\u0027 she whispered. In order to survive, Sophia Matteo, often picked up money between film assignments as a call girl, and she was used to faking orgasms to please her clients, but with this man, there was no need to pretend. He was insatiable, and she found herself climaxing again and again. When they were finally exhausted, Sophia put her 10 arms around him and murmured happily, \u0027 could stay here forever, caro.\u0027 I wish I could, Stanford thought, grimly. a They had dinner at Le C66 de la Place in Plaza du General-de-Gaulle, near the entrance to the village. The dinner was delicious, and for Stanford the danger added spice to the meal. When they were finished, they made their way back to the villa. Stanford walked slowly, to make certain his pursuers followed. At one A. m., a man standing across the street \u0027 the lights in the villa being, turned off, one by one, until the building was in total darkness. At four thirty in the morning, Harry Stanford went into the guest bedroom where Sophia slept. He shook her gently. \u0027 ... T She opened her eyes and looked up at him, a smile of anticipation on her face, then frowned. He was fully dressed* She sat up. \u0027 something wrong?\", MY dear. Everything is fine. You said you liked to travel. Well, were going to take a little trip.\u0027 She was wide awake now. \u0027 this hourr \u0027. We must be very quiet.\"@i .. ! \u0027.\u0027 Fifteen minutes later, Harry Stanford, Sophia, Dmitri, and Prince were moving down the stone.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/morning-noon-and-night/page-1.html","bookId":2366,"book":{"id":2366,"title":"Morning, Noon and Night","description":"Storyline: Cruising on his yacht, Harry Stanford, one of the world\u0027s wealthiest men, drowns under mysterious circumstances.
