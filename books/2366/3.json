One moment Harry Stanford was in a terrible hurry, and the next moment he seemed to have all the time in the world. And the radio shut down? Unheard of! Pazzo. When Blue Skies dropped anchor in the outer harbor, Stanford, Sophia and Dmitri took the yacht\u0027s launch ashore. The small seaport was charming, with a variety of amusing shops and outdoor trattorie lining the single road that led up to the hills. A dozen or so small fishing boats were pulled up onto the pebbled beach. Stanford turned to Sophia. \u0027\u0027ll be lunching at the hotel on top of the hill. There\u0027s a lovely view from there.\u0027 He nodded toward a taxi stopped beyond the docks. \u0027 a taxi up there, and I\u0027ll meet you in a few minutes.\u0027 He handed her some lire. \u0027 well, caro.\" His eyes followed her as she walked away; then he turned to Dmitri. \u0027 have to make a call.\u0027 But notfrom the ship, Dmitri thought.

We have a little problem.\u0027 Stanford closed the door to the booth. He was speaking very fast, and Dmitri could not hear what he was saying. At the end of the conversation, Stanford replaced the receiver and opened the door. \u0027 everything -all right, Mr. Stanford?\" Dmitri asked. \u0027\u0027s get some lunch.\u0027 The Splendido is the crown jewel of Portofino, a hotel with a magnificent panoramic view of the emerald bay below.

When they had finished lunch, Stanford looked at Sophia and grinned. \u0027\u0027s get back to the yacht.\", yes!\u0027 Harry Stanford was a protean lover, passionate and .. His enormous ego made him more concerned about satisfying a woman than about satisfying himself He knew how to excite a woman\u0027s erotic zones, and he orchestrated his lovemaking in a sensuous symphony that brought his lovers-to heights they had never achieved before. They spent the afternoon in Stanford\u0027s suite, and when they we finished making love, Sophia was exhausted.
