I ... \"I\u0027m not talking about the accident. I\u0027m talking about you! The big successful wife who was too busy to find time for her husband.\u0027 It was as though he had slapped her. \u0027\u0027s not true. I ...\" you ever thought about was yourself, Kendall. Everywhere we went, you were always the star. You let me tag along like a pet poodle.\"\u0027s not fair!\u0027 she said. \u0027\u0027t it? You go off to your fashion shows all over the world so you can get your picture in the papers, and I\u0027m sitting here alone, waiting for you to return. Do you think I liked being \"Mr. Kendall?\" I wanted a wife. Don\u0027t worry, my darling Kendall. I consoled myself with other women while you were gone.\u0027 Her face was ashen. \u0027 were real flesh-and-blood women, who had time for me. Not some damned made-up empty shell.\u0027 \"Stop it!\u0027 Kendall cried. \u0027 you told me about the accident, I saw a way to become free of you. Do you want to know some- thing, my dear? I enjoyed watching you squirm when you read those letters. It paid me back a little for all the humiliation I\u0027ve gone through.\"\u0027s enough! Pack your bags and get out of here. I never want to see you again!\u0027 Marc grinned. \u0027\u0027s very little chance of that. By the way, do you still plan to go to the police?\" out!\" Kendall said. \u0027!\"\u0027m leaving. I think I\u0027D go back to Paris. And, darling, I won\u0027t tell if you won\u0027t. You\u0027re safe.\u0027 An hour later, he was gone. At nine o\u0027clock in the morning, Kendall put in a call to Steve Sloane. \u0027 morning, Mrs. Renaud. What can I do for YOUT \u0027\u0027m returning to Boston this afternoon,\u0027 Kendall said. \u0027 have a confession to make.\" She was seated across from Steve, looking pale and drawn. She sat there frozen, unable to begin. Steve prompted her. \u0027 said you had a confession to make.\". I ... I killed someone.\u0027 She began to cry.\n \"It was an accident, but ... I ran away.\u0027 Her face was a C, of anguish. \u0027 ran away . and left her there: T Ake it easy,\u0027 Steve said. \u0027 at the beginning., She began to talk. Thirty minutes later, Steve looked out his window, thinking about what he had just heard. \u0027 you want to go to the police?\u0027. \u0027. It was what I should have done in the first place. I ... I don\u0027t care what they ao\u0027 to me anymore.\u0027 Steve said thoughtfully,\u0027Since you\u0027re giving yourself up voluntarily and it was an accident, I think the court will be lenient.\u0027 She was trying to control herself \u0027 just want it over with.\" about your husbandt She looked up. \u0027 about him?\" is against the law. You have the number of the account in Switzerland where you sent the money he stole from you. All you have to do is press charges and -\"!\u0027 Her tone was fierce. \u0027 don\u0027t want anything more to do with him. Let him go on with his life. I want to get on with mine.\u0027 Steve nodded. \u0027 you say. I\u0027m going to take you down to police headquarters. You. may have to spend the night in jail, but I\u0027ll have you bailed out very quickly.\u0027 Kendall smiled wanly. \u0027 I can do something I\u0027ve never done before.\u0027 \u0027\u0027s thatt \"Design a dress in stripes.\u0027 That evening, when he got home, Steve told Julia what had happened. Julia was horrified. \u0027 own husband was blackmailing her? That\u0027s terrible.\u0027 She studied him for a long moment. \u0027 think it\u0027s wonderful that you spend your life helping people in trouble.\u0027 Steve looked at her and thought, rm the one m trouble. Steve Sloane was awakened by the aroma of fresh coffee and the smell of cooking bacon. He sat up in bed, startled. Had the housekeeper come in today? He had told her not to. Steve put on his robe and slippers, and hurried down to the kitchen. Julia was in there, preparing breakfast. She looked up as Steve entered. \u0027 morning,\u0027 she said cheerfully. \u0027 do you like your eggst \u0027 ... scrambled.\".\n Scrambled eggs and bacon are my specialty. As a matter of fact, my one specialty. I told you, I\u0027m a terrible cook.\u0027 Steve smiled. \u0027 don\u0027t have to cook. If you wanted to, you could hire a few hundred chefs.\" I really going to get that much money, Stevet \u0027\u0027s right. Your share of the estate will be over a billion dollars.\u0027 She found it difficult to swallow. \u0027 billion. ? I don\u0027t believe id\"\u0027s true.\"\n \"There\u0027s not that much money in the world, Steve.\", your father had most of what there was.\" ... I don\u0027t know what to say.\" may I say something?, \u0027 course.\" eggs are burning.\"! Sorry.\u0027 She quickly took them off the stove. \u0027\u0027ll make another batch.\"\u0027t bother. The burned bacon will be enough., She laughed. \u0027\u0027m sorry.\" Steve walked over to the cabinet and took out a box of cereal. \u0027 about a nice cold breakfast?\",\u0027 Julia said. He poured some cereal into a bowl for each of them, took the milk out of the refrigerator, and they sat down at the kitchen table. \u0027\u0027t you have someone to cook for yout Julia asked. \u0027 mean, am I involved with anyonet She blushed. \u0027 like that.\u0027 . \u0027. I was in a relationship for two years, but it didn\u0027t work out.\"\u0027m sorry.\" about yout Steve asked. 525 She thought of Henry Wesson. \u0027 don\u0027t think so. He looked at her, curious. \u0027 aren\u0027t sure?\"\u0027s difficult to explain. One of us wants to get married,\u0027 she said tactfully, \u0027 one of us doesn\u0027t.\" see. When this is over, will you be going back to Kansas?\u0027 - \u0027 honestly don\u0027t know. It seems so strange, being here. My mother talked to me so often about Boston. She was born here, and loved it. In a way, it\u0027s like coming home. I wish I could have known my father.\u0027 No, you don\u0027t, Steve thought. \u0027 you know him?\". He dealt only with Simon Fitzgerald.\u0027 They sat there talking for more than an hour, and there was an easy camaraderie between them. Steve filled Julia in on what had hippened earlier - the arrival of the stranger who called herself Julia Stanford, the empty. grave and Dmitri Kaminsky\u0027s disappearance. \u0027\u0027s incredible!\u0027 Julia said. \u0027 could be behind thist \u0027 don\u0027t know, but I\u0027m trying to find out,\u0027 Steve assured her. \u0027 the meantime, you\u0027ll be safe here. Very safe.\u0027 She smiled, and said, \u0027 feel safe here. Thank you.\u0027 He started to say something, then stopped.\n He looked at his watch. \u0027\u0027d better get dressed and get down to the office. I have a lot to do.\u0027 Steve was meeting with Fitzgerald. \u0027 progress yeff Fitzgerald asked. Steve shook his head. \u0027\u0027s all smoke.\n Whoever planned this is a genius. I\u0027m trying to trace Dmitri Kaminsky.\n He flew from Corsica to-Paris to Australia. I spoke to the Sydney police. They were stunned to learn that Kaminsky is in their country.\n There\u0027s a circular out from Interpol, and they\u0027re looking for him. I think Harry Stanford signed his own death warrant when he called here and said he wanted to change his will. Someone decided to stop him. The only witness to what happened on the yacht that night is Dmitri Kaminsky. When we find him, we\u0027ll know a lot more.\u0027, \u0027 wonder if we should bring our police in on thist Fitzgerald suggested. Steve shook his head. \u0027 we know is all circumstantial, Simon. The only crime we can prove is that someone dug up a body - and we don\u0027t even know who did that.\" about the detective they hired, who verified the\u0027woman\u0027s fingerprints?\" Timmons. I\u0027ve left three messages for him. If I don\u0027t hear back from him by six o\u0027clock tonight, I\u0027m going to fly to Chicago. I believe he\u0027s deeply involved.\u0027 \u0027 do you suppose was meant to happen to the shires of the estate that the impostor was going to gett \u0027 hunch is that whoever planned this had her sign her share over to them. The person probably used some dummy trusts to hide it. I\u0027m convinced that we\u0027re looking for a member of the family ... I think we can eliminate Kendall as a suspect.\u0027 He told Fitzgerald about the conversation he had had with her. \u0027 she were behind this, she wouldn\u0027t have come forth with a confession, not at this time, anyway. She would have waited until the estate was settled and she had the money. As far as her husband is concerned, I think we can eliminate Marc. He\u0027s a small-time blackmailer. He isn\u0027t capable of setting up anything like this.\" about the otherst - \u0027 Stanford. I talked to a friend of mine with the Chicago Bar Association. My friend says everyone thinks very highly of Stanford. In fact, he\u0027s just been appointed chief judge.\n Another thing in his favor: Judge Stanford was the one who said that the first Julia who appeared was a fraud, and he was the one who insisted on a DNA test. I doubt he\u0027d do something like this. Woody interests me. I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s on drugs, and that\u0027s an expensive habit. I checked on his wife, Peggy. She isn\u0027t smart enough to be behind this scheme. But there\u0027s a rumor she has a brother who\u0027s bad business. I\u0027m going to look into it.\u0027 Steve spoke to his secretary on the intercom. \u0027 get me Lieutenant Michael Kennedy of the Boston police., A, few minutes later, she buzzed Steve. \u0027 Kennedy is on line one.\u0027 Steve picked up the phone. \u0027. Thank you for taking my call. I\u0027m Steve Sloane with Renquist, Renquist, \u0026 Fitzgerald. We\u0027re trying to locate a relative in the matter of the Harry Stanford estate.\". Sloane, I\u0027d be glad to help if I can.\", you please check with the New York City police to see if they have any files on Mrs. Woodrow Stanford\u0027s brother. His name is Hoop Malkovich. He works in a bakery in the Bronx.\" problem. I\u0027ll get back to you.\".\u0027 After lunch, Simon Fitzgerald stopped by Steve\u0027s office. \u0027\u0027s the investigation going?\u0027 he asked. \u0027 slow to suit me. Whoever planned this covered his or her tracks pretty thoroughly.\" is Julia holding upt Steve smiled. \u0027\u0027s wonderful.\u0027 There was something in the tone of his voice that made Simon Fitzgerald take a closer look at him. \u0027\u0027s a very attractive young lady.\" know,\u0027 Steve said wistfully. \u0027 know.\u0027 An hour later, the call came in from Australia. \u0027. Sloanet \u0027. \u0027 Inspector Mcphearson here from Sydney.\", Chief Inspector.\" found your man.\u0027 Steve felt his heart jump. \u0027\u0027s wonderful! I\u0027d like to arrange immediate extradition to bring him ...\", I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any hurry. Dmitri Kaminsky is dead.\u0027 Steve felt his heart sink.\n \u002791hat?\" found his body a little while ago. His fingers had been chopped off, and he had been. shot several times.\" Russian gangs have a quaint custom. First they chop off your fingers, then they let you bleed, and then they shoot you.\" see. Thank you, inspector! Dead end Steve sat there, staring at the wall. All his leads were disappearing.\n He realized how heavily he had been counting on Dmitri Kaminsky\u0027s testimony. Steve\u0027s secretary interrupted his thoughts. \u0027\u0027s a Mr. Timmons for you on line three.\u0027 Steve looked at his watch. It was 5:55 P.m. He picked up the telephone. \u0027. Timmonst \u0027 ... I\u0027m sorry I couldn\u0027t return your calls earlier. I\u0027ve been out of town for the past two days. What can I do for yout A lot, Steve thought. You can tell me how youfaked thosefingerprints. Steve chose his words carefully. \u0027\u0027m calling about Julia Stanford. When you were in Boston recently, you checked out her fingerprints and .. \u0027. Sloane ...\" \u0027\u0027ve never been in Boston.\u0027 Steve took a deep breath. \u0027. Timmons, -according to the register at the Holiday Inn, you were here on .. \u0027 has been using my name.\u0027 Steve listened, stunned. It was the final dead end, the last lead. \u0027 don\u0027t suppose you have any idea who it is?, \u0027, it\u0027s very strange, Mr. Sloane. A woman claimed that I was in Boston and that I could identify her as Julia Stanford. I\u0027d never seen her before in my life.\u0027 Steve felt a surge of hope. \u0027 you know who she 1st \u0027. Her name is Posner. Margo Posner.\u0027 Steve picked up a pen. \u0027 can I reach hert \u0027\u0027s at the Reed Mental Health Facility in Chicago., \u0027 a lot. I really appreciate this.\"\u0027s keep in touch. I\u0027d like to know what\u0027s going on myself. I don\u0027t like people going around impersonating me.\".\u0027 Steve replaced the receiver. Margo Posner. When Steve got home that evening, Julia was waiting to greet him. \u0027 fixed dinner,\" she told him. \u0027, I didn\u0027t exactly fix it. Do you like Chinese foodt He smiled. \u0027 it!\". We have eight cartons of it.\u0027 When Steve walked into the dining room, the\u0027table was set with flowers and candles, \"Is there any newst Julia asked. Steve said cautiously, \u0027 may have gotten our first break. I have the name of a woman who seems to be involved in this. I\u0027m flying to Chicago in the morning to talk with her.\n I have a feeling we may have all the answers tomorrow.\" would be wonderful!\u0027 Julia said excitedly. \u0027\u0027ll be so glad when this is over.\" \"So will I,\u0027 Steve told her. Or will P She\u0027ll be a real part of the Stanford fainfly - way out of my reach. Dinner lasted two hours, and they were not even aware of what they were eating. They talked about everything and they talked about nothing, and it was as though they had known each other forever. They discussed the past and the present, and they carefully avoided talking about the future. There is nofuturefor us, Steve thought unhappily. Finally, reluctantly, Steve said, \u0027, we\u0027d better go to bed., She looked at him with raised eyebrows, and they both burst out laughing. \u0027 I meant ...\" know what you meant.\n Good night, Steve.\" nigh t, Julia.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/morning-noon-and-night/page-30.html","bookId":2366,"book":{"id":2366,"title":"Morning, Noon and Night","description":"Storyline: \n Cruising on his yacht, Harry Stanford, one of the world\u0027s wealthiest men, drowns under mysterious circumstances.
