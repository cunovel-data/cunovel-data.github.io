Woody said. \u0027 reading is supposed to be tomorrow.\"\u0027s someone I want you to meet,\u0027 Steve told them. \" sister.\u0027 They were both staring at him. \u0027\u0027ve already met her,\u0027 Kendall said. Steve pressed a button on the intercom. \u0027 you ask her to come in, pleaset Kendall and Woody looked at each other, puzzled. The door opened, and Julia Stanford walked into the office. Steve stood up. \u0027 is your sister, Julia.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell are you talking aboutt Woody exploded. \u0027 are you trying to pulff \u0027 me explain,\u0027 Steve said quietly. He spoke for fifteen minutes, and finished by saying, \u0027 Winger confirmed that her DNA matches your father\u0027s.\u0027 When he was through, Woody said, \"Tyler! I can\u0027t believe it!\" it.\" don\u0027t understand. The other woman\u0027s fingerprints prove that she is Julia,\u0027 Woody said. \u0027 still have the fingerprmt card.\u0027 Steve felt his pulse pounding. \u0027 dot \"Yeah. I kept it as kind of a joke,-\" want you to do me a favor,\" Steve said. At ten o\u0027clock the next morning, a large group was gathered in the conference room of Renquist, Renquist \u0026 Fitzgerald. Simon Fitzgerald sat at the head of a table. In the room were Kendall, Tyler, Woody, Steve, and Julia. In addition, there were several strangers present. Fitzgerald introduced two of them. \u0027 is William Parker and Patrick Evans. They\u0027re with the law firms that represent Stanford Enterprises. They\u0027ve brought with them the financial report on the company. I\u0027ll discuss the will first, then they can take over the meeting.\"\u0027s get on with it,\u0027 Tyler said impatiently. He was sitting apart from the others. I\u0027m not only going to get the money, but Im going to destroy you bastards. Simon Fitzgerald nodded. \u0027 well.\u0027 In front of Fitzgerald was a large file marked HARRY STANFORD - LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT. \u0027\u0027m going to give each of you a copy of the will so it won\u0027t be necessary to wade through all the technicalities. I 9ve already told you that Harry Stanford\u0027s children ill equally inherit the estate.\u0027 Julia glanced over at Steve, a look of bemusement on her face.\\n\\n Fm gladfor her, Steve thought. Even though it puts her way out of my reach. Simon Fitzgerald was going on. \u0027 are a dozen or so bequests, but they\u0027re all minor.\u0027 Tyler was thinking, Lee will be here this afternoon. I want to be at the airport to meet him \u0027 you were told earlier, Stanford Enterprises has assets of approximately six billion dollars.\u0027 Fitzgerald nodded toward William Parker.\u0027I\u0027ll let Mr. Parker take it from here.\u0027 William Parker opened a briefcase and spread some papers out on the conference table. \u0027 Mr. Fitzgerald said, there are six billion dollars in assets. However ... 9 , was a pregnant pause. He looked around the room. \u0027 Enterprises is in debt in excess of fifteen billion dollars.\u0027 Woody was on his feet. \u0027 the hell are you sayine.\u0027 Tyler\u0027s face turned ashen. \u0027 this some kind of macabre joket \u0027 has to be!\u0027 Kendall said hoarsely. Mr. Parker turned to one of the men in the room. \u0027. Leonard Redding is with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I\u0027ll let him explain.\u0027 Redding nodded. \u0027 the last two years, Harry Stanford was convinced that interest rates were going to fall. In the past, he had made millions by betting on that. When interest rates started to rise, he was still convinced they would drop again, and he kept leveraging his bets. He did massive borrowing to buy long-term bonds, but the interest rates went up and his borrowing costs jumped, while the value of the bonds tumbled. The banks were willing to do business with him because of his reputation and his vast fortune, but when he tried to recoup his losses by starting to invest in high-risk securities, they began to get worried. He made a series of disastrous investments. Some of the money he borrowed was pledged by securities he had bought with borrowed money as collateral for\u0027 further borrowing.\" other words,\u0027 Patrick Evans interjected, \u0027 was pyramiding his debts, operating illegally.\" is correct.\\n\\n Unfortunately for him, interest rates underwent one of the steepest climbs in financial history. He had to keep borrowing money to cover the money he had already borrowed. It was a vicious circle.\u0027 They sat there, hanging on Redding\u0027s every word. \u0027 father gave his personal guarantee to the company\u0027s pension plan and illegally used that money to buy more stock. When the banks began to question what he was doing, he set up decoy companies and provided false records of solvency and fake sales of his properties to drive up the value of his paper. He was committing fraud. In the end, he was counting on a consortium of banks to bail him out of trouble., They refused. When they told the Securities and Exchange Commission what was happening, Interpol was brought into the picture.\u0027 Redding indicated the man seated next to him.\\n\\n \"This is Inspector Patou, with the French Sftret6. Inspector, would you explain the rest of it, pleaset Inspector Patou spoke English with a slight French accent. \u0027 the request of Interpol, we traced Harry Stanford to St.-Paul-de-Vence, and I sent three detectives there to follow him. He managed to elude them. Interpol had put out a green code to all police departments that Harry Stanford was under suspicion and should be watched. If they had known the extent of his crimes, they would have circulated a red code, or top priority, and we would have apprehended him.\u0027 Woody -was in a state of -shock. \u0027\u0027s why he left us his estate. Because there was nothing in it!\u0027 William Parker said, \"You\u0027re right about that. You were all in your father\u0027s will because the banks refused to go along with him and he knew that, in essence, he was leaving you nothing. But he spoke to Ren6 Gautier at Cr6dit Lyonnais, who promised to help him. The moment Harry Stanford thought that he was solvent again, he planned to change his will to cut you out of it., \"But what about the yacht, and the plane, `:4\u003c3\u0027 and the housest Kendall asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 Parker said. \u0027 will be sold to pay off part of the debt.\u0027 Tyler sat there, numb. It was a nightmare beyond imagining.\\n\\n He was no longer Tyler Stanford, Multibillionaire. He was merely a judge. Tyler got up to leave, shaken. \u0027 I don\u0027t know what to say.\\n\\n If there\u0027s nothing else.. He had to get to the airport quickly to meet Lee and try to explain what had happened. Steve spoke up. \u0027 is something else.\u0027 He turned. \u0027?\u0027 Steve nodded to a man standing at the door. The door opened, and Hal Baker walked in. \u0027, judge-\u0027 The breakthrough had come when Woody told Steve that he had the fingerprint card. \u0027\u0027d like to see it,\u0027 Steve told him. Woody had been puzzled.\\n\\n \"Why? It just has the woman\u0027s two sets of fingerprints on it, and they matched. We all checked it.\" the man who called himself Frank Timmons took the fingerprints, right?\".\" if he touched the card, his fingerprints will be on it.\u0027 Steve\u0027s hunch had proved to be right. Hal Baker\u0027s prints were all over the card, and it had taken less than thirty minutes for the computers to reveal his identity. Steve had telephoned the district attorney in Chicago. A warrant was issued, and two detectives had appeared at Hal Baker\u0027s house. He was in the yard playing catch with Billy. \u0027. Bakert \u0027.\u0027 The detectives showed their badges. \u0027 district attorney would like to talk to you.\". I can\u0027t.\u0027 He was indignant. \u0027 I ask whyt one of the detectives asked.\\n\\n \"You can see why, can\u0027t you? I\u0027m playing ball with my son!\u0027 The district attorney had read the transcript of Hal Baker\u0027s trial. He looked at the man seated in front of him and said, \u0027 understand you\u0027re a family man.\" \"That\u0027s right,\u0027 Hal Baker said proudly. \u0027\u0027s what this country is all about. If every family could -\". Baker. He leaned forward. \u0027\u0027ve been working with Judge Stanford.\" don\u0027t know any Judge Stanford.\"\\n\\n \"Let me refresh your memory. He put you on parole. He used you to impersonate a private detective named Frank Timmons, and we have reason to believe he also asked you to kill a Julia Stanford.\" don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\u0027 \u0027 I\u0027m talking about is a sentence of ten to twenty years. I\u0027m going to push for the twenty.\u0027 Hal Baker turned pale. \u0027 can\u0027t do that! Why, my wife and kids would ...\". On the other hand,\u0027 the district attorney said, \u0027 you\u0027re willig to turn state\u0027s evidence, I\u0027m prepared to arrange for you-to get off very lightly.\u0027 Hal Baker was beginning to pefspire. \u0027 ... what do I have to dot - \u0027 to me.\u0027 Now, in the conference room of Renquist, Renquist \u0026 Fitzgerald, Hal Baker looked at Tyler, and said, \u0027 are you, judget Woody looked up and exclaimed, \u0027! It\u0027s Frank Timmons!\u0027 Steve said to Tyler, \u0027 is the man you ordered to break into our offices to get you a copy of your father\u0027s will, to dig up your father\u0027s body, and to kill Julia Stanford.\u0027 It took a moment for Tyler to find his voice. \u0027\u0027re crazy! He\u0027s a convicted felon. No one is going to take his word against mine!\" one has to take his word,\u0027 Steve said. \u0027 you seen this man beforet \u0027 course. He was tried in my court.\"\u0027s his namet \"His name is ...\u0027 Tyler saw the trap. \u0027 mean ... he probably has a lot of aliases.\u0027 \u0027 you tried him in your courtroom, his name was Hal Baker.\" ... that\u0027s right.\" when he came to Boston, you introduced him as Frank Timmons.\u0027 Tyler was floundering. \u0027, I ... I ... \u0027 had him released into your custody, and you used him to try to prove that Margo Posner was the real Julia.\"! I had nothing to do with that. I never met that woman until she showed up here.\u0027 Steve turned to Lieutenant Kennedy. \u0027 you get that, Lieutenant?\".\" Steve turned back to Tyler. \u0027 checked on Margo Posner. She was also tried in your courtroom and released into your custody. The district attorney in Chicago issued a search warrant-this morning for your safe-deposit box. He called a little while ago to tell me that they found a document giving you Julia Stanford\u0027s share of your father\u0027s estate. The document was signed five days before the supposed Julia Stanford arrived in Boston.\u0027 Tyler was breathing hard, trying to regain his wits. \u0027 ... I ... This is preposterous!\u0027 Lieutenant Kennedy said, \"I\u0027m placing you under arrest, Judge Stanford, for conspiracy to commit murder. We\u0027ll arrange for extradition papers. You\u0027ll be sent back to Chicago.\u0027 Tyler stood there, his world collapsing around him. \u0027 have the right to remain silent. If you choose to give up this right anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present with you while you are being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning, if you yvish one. Do you understandt Lieutenant Kennedy asked. \u0027.\u0027 And then a slow triumphant smile lit his1ace. I know how to beat them! he thought happily. \u0027 you ready, judget He nodded and said calmly, \u0027. I\u0027m ready. I\u0027d like to go back to Rose. Hill to pick up my things.\"\u0027s fine. We\u0027ll have these two policemen accompany you.% Tyler turned to look at Julia, and there was so much hatred in his eyes that it made her shudder. Thirty minutes later, Tyler and the two policemen reached Rose Hill. They walked into the front hall. , will take me only a few minutes to pack,\u0027 Tyler said. They watched as Tyler went up the staircase to his room. In his room, Tyler walked over to the bureau containing the revolver and loaded it. The sound of the shot seemed to reverberate forever. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/morning-noon-and-night/page-34.html","bookId":2366,"book":{"id":2366,"title":"Morning, Noon and Night","description":"Storyline: Cruising on his yacht, Harry Stanford, one of the world\u0027s wealthiest men, drowns under mysterious circumstances.
