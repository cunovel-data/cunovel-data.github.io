Do Ifeel guilty because I never tried to get in touch with him, or do I feel angry because he never tried to find me? It doesn\u0027t matter anymore, she thought. He\u0027s gone. Her father had been dead to her all her life, and now he had died again, cheating her out of something she had no words for. Inexplicably, she felt an overwhelming sense of loss. Stupid!

The eyes. have the same deep gray eyes. Julia went into her bedroom closet, removed a battered cardboard box, and from it lifted a leather-bound scrapbook. She sat on the edge of her bed and opened the box. For the next two hours, she pored over its familiar contents. There were countless photographs of her mother in her governess\u0027s uniform, with Harry Stanford and Mrs. Stanford and their three young children. Most of the pictures had been taken on their yacht, atkose Hill, or at the Hobe Sound villa. Julia picked up the yellowed newspaper clippings recounting the scandal that had happened so many years before in Boston. The faded headlines were lurid: LOVE NEST ON BEACON HILL BILLIONAIRE HARRY STANFORD IN SCANDAL TYCOON\u0027S WIFE COMMITS SUICIDE GOVERNESS ROSEMARY NELSON DISAPPEARS There were dozens of gossip columns filled with innuendos. Julia sat there for a long time, lost in the past. She had been born at St. Joseph\u0027s Hospital in Milwaukee. Her earliest memories were of living in dreary walk-up apartments and constantly moving from city to city. There were, times when there was no money at all, and little to eat. Her mother was continually ill, and it had been difficult for her to find steady work.\n The young girl quickly learned never to ask for toys or new dresses. 112 Julia started school when she was five, and her classmates would mock her because she wore the same dress \"\u0027and scruffy shoes every day.\n When the other children\n [email protected]\n /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */\n ,teased her, Julia fought them. She was a rebel, and she *as always being brought up before the principal. Her teachers didn\u0027t know what to do with her. She was in tonstant trouble.\n She might have been expelled except for one thing: she was the brightest student in her class. Her mother had told Julia that her father was dead, and she had accepted that. But when Julia was twelve years old, she stumbled across a picture album filled with photographs of her mother with a group of Strangers. \u0027 are these people?\u0027 Julia asked.\n And Julia\u0027s mother decided that the time had come. \u0027 down, my darling.\u0027 She took Julia\u0027s hand and held it tightly. There was no way to break the news tactfully.-\u0027That is your father, and your half sister, and your two half brothers.\u0027 Julia was , looking at her, puzzled. \u0027 don\u0027t understand.\u0027 The truth had finally come out, shattering Julia\u0027s peace of mind. Her father was alive! And she had a half sister and two half brothers. It was too much to comprehend.\u0027Why ... why did you lie to me?\" were too young to understand. Your father and I ... had an affair. He was married, and I ... I had to leave, to have you.\" hate him!\u0027 Julia said. 113 \u0027 mustn\u0027t hate him.\" could he have done this to yout she demanded. \u0027 happened was my fault as much as his.\" Each word was agony. \u0027 father was a very attractive man, and I was young and foolish. I knew that nothing could ever come of our affair. He told me he loved me ... but he was married and had a family. And ... and then I became pregnant.\u0027 It was difficult for her to go on. \u0027 reporter got hold of the story and it was in all the newspapers. I ran away. I intended for you and me to go back to him, but his wife killed herself, and I ... I could never face him or the children again. It was my fault you see. So don\u0027t blame him.\u0027 But there was a part of the story Rosemary never revealed to her daughter. When the baby was born, the clerk at the hospital said, \u0027\u0027re filling out the birth certificate. The baby\u0027s name is Julia Nelsont Rosemary had started to say yes, and then she thought fiercely, No! She\u0027s Harry Stanford\u0027s daughter. She\u0027s entitled to his name, and his support. \u0027 daughter\u0027s name is Julia Stanford.\u0027 She had written to Harry Stanford, telling him about Julia, but she had never had a reply. Julia was fascinated by the idea that she had a family she had not known about, and also by the fact that they were famous enough to be written about in the pre ss. She went to the public library and looked up 114 everything she Could, about Harry Stanford. There , dozens of articles about him. He was a billionaire, \"and he lived in another world, a world that Julia and her mother were totally excluded from. one day, when one of Julia\u0027s classmates teased her , being poor, Julia said defiantly, \u0027\u0027m not poor! My father is one of the- richest men in the world. We have a yacht and an airplane, and a dozen beautiful ,.\u0027 Her teacher heard her. \u0027, come up here.\u0027 Julia approached the teacher\u0027s desk. \u0027 must not ttell a lie like that.\"\n \"It\u0027s not a lie,\u0027 Julia retorted. \u0027 father is a billionaire! He knows presidents and kings!\u0027 The teacher looked at the young girl standing before her in her shabby cotton dress and said, \u0027, that\u0027s not [email protected] \u0027 1st\u0027 Julia said stubbornly. She was sent to the principal\u0027s office. She never mentioned her father at school again. , Julia learned that the reason she and her mother kept moving from city to city was because of the news media. Harry Stanford was constantly in the press, and the gossip newspapers and magazines kept digging up the old scandal. Investigative reporters would eventually discover who Rosemary Nelson was and where she arrived, and she would have to take Julia and flee. 115 Julia read every newspaper story that appeared about Harry Stanford, and each time, she was tempted to telephone him. She wanted to believe that during all those years he had been desperately searching for her mother. I\u0027ll call and say, \u0027 is your daughter. If you want to see us . And he would come to them and fall in love all over again, and marry her mother, and they would all live happily together. Julia Stanford grew into a beautiful young woman. She had lustrous dark hair, a laughing, generous mouth, the luminous gray eyes of her father, and a gently curved figure. But when she smiled, people forgot about everything else but that smile. Because they were forced to move so often, Julia went to schools in five different states. During the summers she worked as a clerk in -a department store, behind the counter in a drugstore, and as a receptionist. She was always fiercely independent.\n They were living in Kansas City, Kansas, when Julia finished college on a scholarship. She was not sure what she wanted to do with her life.\n Friends, impressed by her beauty, suggested that she become a movie actress. \u0027\u0027d be a star overnight!\u0027 Julia had dismissed the idea with a casual, \u0027 wants to get up that early every morning?\u0027 But the real reason she was not interested was 116 use she wanted, above all, her privacy. It seemed to Julia that all their lives, she and her mother had been @hoiinded by the press because of what had happened so many years earlier. Julia\u0027s dream of one day uniting her mother and father ,,ended the day her mother died. Julia felt an overpowering sense of loss.\n Myjather has to know, Julia thought. Mother was a part of his life. She looked up the telephone number of his business headquarters in Boston. A receptionist answered. \u0027 morning, Stanford Enterprises.\u0027 Julia hesitated. \u0027 Enterprises. Hello? May I help yout Slowly Julia replaced the receiver. Mother wouldn\u0027t have wanted me to make that call.\n She was alone now. She had no one. Julia buried her mother at Memorial Park Cemetery in Kansas City. There were no mourners. Julia stood at the graveside and thought, It isn\u0027tfair, Mama You made one mistake andpaidjor it-the rest of your life. I wish I could have taken some of your pain away. I love you very much, Mama. I\u0027ll always love you. All she had left of her mother\u0027s years on earth was a collection of old photographs and clippings. With her mother gone, Julia\u0027s thoughts turned to the Stanford family. They were rich. She could go to them 117 _LL- for help. Never, she decided. Not after the way Harry Stanford treated my mother. But she had to earn a living. She was faced with a career decision. She thought wryly, Maybe I\u0027ll become a brain surgeon. Or a painter? Opera singer? Physicist? Astronaut? She settled for a secretarial course at night school at Kansas City, Kansas, Community College. The day after Julia finished the course, she visited an employment agency. There were a dozen applicants waiting to see the employment counselor. Sitting next to Julia was an attractive woman her age. \u0027! I\u0027m Sally Connors.\" Stanford.\"\u0027ve got to get a job today,\u0027 Sally moaned. \u0027\u0027ve been kicked out of my apartment.\u0027 Julia heard her name called. \u0027 luck!\u0027 Sally said. \u0027.\u0027 Julia walked into the office of the employment counselor. \u0027 down, please.\" you.\" see from your application that you have a college education and summer work experience. And you have a high recommendation from the secretarial school.\u0027 118 she looked at the dossier on her desk. \u0027 take short. hand at ninety words per minute, and type at sixty ,..,words per minutet \u0027, ma\u0027am.\" might have just the thing for you. There\u0027s a small firm of architects that\u0027s looking for a secretary. The -salary isn\u0027t very large, I\u0027m afraid.\"\u0027s okay,\u0027 Julia said quickly. \u0027 well. I\u0027m going to send [email protected] over there.\u0027 She handed Julia a slip of paper with a typed name and address on it. \u0027\u0027ll interview you at noon tomorrow.1 Julia smiled happily. \u0027 you.\u0027 She was filled with a sense of excitement. When Julia came out of the office, Sally\u0027s name was being called. \u0027 hope you get something,\u0027 Julia said. \u0027! On an impulse, Julia decided to stay and wait. Ten minutes later, when Sally came out of the inner office, she was grinning. \u0027 got an interview! She telephoned, and I\u0027m going to the American Mutual Insurance Company, tomorrow for a receptionist job. How did you dot \u0027\u0027ll know tomorrow, too.\"\u0027m sure we\u0027ll make it. Why don\u0027t we have lunch together and celebratet \u0027.\u0027 119 At lunch they talked, and their friendship clicked instantly. @ \u0027 looked at an, apartment in Overland Park,\u0027 Sally said. \u0027\u0027s a two-bedroom and bath, with a kitchen and living room. It\u0027s really nice. I can\u0027t afford it alone, but if the two of us.. Julia smiled. \u0027\u0027d like that.\u0027 She crossed her fingers. \u0027 I get the job.\"\n \"You\u0027ll get it!\u0027 Sally assured her. On the way to the offices of Peters, Eastman \u0026 Tolkin, Julia thought, This could be my big opportunity. This could lead anywhere. I mean, this isn\u0027t just a job. r1l be working for architects. Dreamers who build and shape the city\u0027s skyline, who create beauty and magic out of stone. Maybe ril study architecture myse#@,\u0027 so that I can help them and be a part of that dream. The office was in a dingy old commercial building on Amour Boulevard. Julia took the elevator to the third floor, got off and stopped at a scarred door marked PETERS, EASTMAN \u0026 TOLKIN, ARCHITECTS. She took a deep breath to calm herself and entered. \u0027 men were waiting for her in the reception room, examining her as she walked in the door. \u0027\u0027re here for the secretarial jobt \u0027, sir.\"\u0027m Al Peters.\u0027 The bald -one.\n \"Bob Eastman.\u0027 The ponytail. 120 \u0027 Tolkin.\u0027 The potbelly. They all appeared to be somewhere in their forties. \u0027 understand this is your first secretarial job,\u0027 Al Peters said. \u0027, it is,\u0027 Julia replied.\n Then quickly she added, \u0027 I\u0027m a fast learner. I\u0027ll work very hard.\u0027She decided not to me ntion her idea about going to school to study yet. She would wait unt\u0027il they got to know her better. \u0027 right, we\u0027ll try you out,\u0027 Bob Eastman said,\u0027and see how it goes.\u0027 Julia felt a sense of exhilaration. \u0027, thank you! You won\u0027t be - 9 \u0027 the salary,\u0027 Max Tolkin said. \u0027\u0027m afraid we can\u0027t pay very much at the beginning.\"\u0027s all right,\u0027 Julia said. \u0027 ...\" hundred a week,\u0027 A] Peters tqld her. They were right. It was not much money. Julia made a quick decision. \u0027\u0027ll take it.\u0027 They looked at one another and exchanged smiles. \u0027!\u0027 Al Peters said. \u0027 me show you around.\u0027 The tour took only a few seconds. There was the little reception room and three small offices that looked as though they had been furnished by the Salvation Army. The lavatory was down the hall. They were all architects, but Al, Peters was the businessman, Bob Eastman was the salesman, and Max Tolkin handled construction. \u0027\u0027ll be working for all of us,\u0027 Peters told her. 121 \u0027.\u0027 Julia knew she was going to make herself indispensable to them. Al Peters looked at his watch. \u0027\u0027s twelve thirty. How about some lunch?\u0027 Julia felt a little thrill. She was part of the team now. they\u0027re inviting me to lunch. He turned to Julia. \u0027\u0027s a delicatessen down the block. I\u0027ll have a corned beef sandwich on rye with mustard, potato salad, and a Danish.\".\u0027 So much for \u0027\u0027re inviting me to lunch.\u0027 Tolkin said, \u0027\u0027ll have a pastrami and some chicken soup: \u0027, sir.\u0027 Bob Eastman spoke, up. \u0027\u0027ll have the pot roast platter and a soft drink.\", make sure the corned beef is lean,\u0027 Al Peters told her. \u0027 corned beef.\u0027 Max Tolkin said, \u0027 sure that the soup is hot.\". Soup hot.\u0027 Bob Eastman said, \u0027 my soft drink a diet cola.\" cola.\"\u0027s some money.\u0027Al Peters handed her a twentydollar bill. Ten minutes later, Julia was in the delicatessen, talking to the man behind the counter. \u0027 want one lean corned beef sandwich on rye with mustard, potato salad, and a Danish. A pastrami sandwich and very 122 hot chicken soup. And a pot roast platter and diet cola., he man nodded. \u0027 work for Peters, Eastman, A Tolkin, huh?\u0027 and Sally moved into the apartment in Overland the following week.\n The apartment consisted of ro small bedrooms, a living room with furniture that \u0027 seen too many tenants, a kitchenette, dinette, and a bathroom. 7hey\u0027ll never confuse this place with the AM, Julia thought.\n \"We\u0027ll take turns at cooking,\u0027 Sally suggested. \u0027.\u0027 Sally prepared the first meal, and it was delicious. The next night was Julia\u0027s turn.\n Sally took one bite of the dish that Julia had made and said, \u0027, I don\u0027t have a lot of life insurance. Why don\u0027t I do the cooking and you do the cleaning?\u0027 The two roommates got along well. On weekends they would go to see movies at the Glenwood 4, and shop at the Bannister Mall. They bought their clothes at the Super Flea Discount House. One night a week they went out to an inexpensive restaurant for dinner - Stephenson\u0027s Old Apple Farm or the cafe Max for Mediterranean specialties. When they could afford it, they would drop in at Charlie Charlies to hear jazz. 123 Julia enjoyed working for Peters, Eastman \u0026 Tolkin. To say that the firm was not doing well was an understatement.\n Clients were scarce. Julia felt that she wasn\u0027t doing much to help build the skyline of the city, but she enjoyed being around her three bosses.\n They were like a surrogate family, and each one confided his problems to Julia. She was capable and efficient, and she very quickly reorganized the office. Julia decided to do something about the lack of clients. But what? She soon had the answer. There was an item in the Kansas City Star about a luncheon for a new executive secretary organization. The chairperson was Susan Bandy. The following day, at noon-, Julia said to Al Peters, \u0027 may be a little late coming back from lunch.\u0027 . He smiled.\n \"No problem, Julia.\u0027 He thought how lucky they were to have her. Julia arrived at the Plaza Inn and went to the room where the luncheon was being given. The woman seated at the table near the door said, \u0027 I help Your \u0027. I\u0027m here for the Executive Women\u0027s luncheon.\" name?\" Stanford.\u0027 The woman looked at the list in front of her.\n \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t see your -\u0027 Julia smiled. \u0027\u0027t that just like Susan? I\u0027ll have to 124 have a talk with her. I\u0027m the executive secretary with Peters, Eastman, \u0026 Tolkin.\u0027 The woman looked uncertain.\n \"Well .. \u0027\u0027t worry about it. I\u0027ll just go in and find ,.\u0027 In the banquet room was a group of well-dressed women chatting among themselves. Julia approached one of them. \u0027 one is Susan Bandy?\"\n \"She\u0027s over there.\u0027 She indicated, a tall, striking looking woman in her forties. Julia went up to her. \u0027. I\u0027m Julia Stanford.\".\"\u0027m with Peters, Eastman, \u0026 Tolkin. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve heard of them.\", I ...\"\u0027re the fastest growing architectural firm in Kansas City.\" 41 see.1 \u0027 don\u0027t have a lot of time to spare, but I would like to contribute whatever I can to the organization.\", that\u0027s very kind of you, Miss ... \u0027.\u0027 That was the beginning. The Executive Women\u0027s organization represented most of the top firms in Kansas City, and in no time at all, Julia was networking with them. She had lunch with one or more of the individual members at least once a week.\n 125 \u0027 company is going to put up a new building in Olathe.\u0027 And Julia would immediately report back to her bosses. @ \u0027. Hanley wants to build a summer home in Tonganoxie.\u0027 And before anyone else found out about it, Peters, Eastman \u0026 Tolkin had the jobs. Bob Eastman called Julia in one day and said, \u0027 deserve a raise, Julia. You\u0027re doing a great job.\n You\u0027re one hell of a secretary!\" you do me a favort Julia asked.\n \"Sure.\" me an executive secretary. It will help my credibility.\" From time to time, Julia would read newspaper articles about her father, or watch him being interviewed on television. She never mentioned him to Sally or to her employers. When Julia was younger, one of her daydreams had been that, like Dorothy, she would one day be whisked away from Kansas to some beautiful, magical place. It would be a place filled with yachts and private planes and palaces. But now, with the news of her father\u0027s death, that dream was ended forever. Welli I got the Kansas part right, she thought wryly. I have nofamily left. But I do, Julia corrected herself. I have two halfbrothers and a ha#sister. They\u0027refamily.\n Should I go visi t them? Good idea? Bad idea? I wonder how we wouldfeel about one another? Her decision turned out to be a matter of life or death. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/morning-noon-and-night/page-11.html","bookId":2366,"book":{"id":2366,"title":"Morning, Noon and Night","description":"Storyline: \n Cruising on his yacht, Harry Stanford, one of the world\u0027s wealthiest men, drowns under mysterious circumstances.
