I probably shouldn\u0027t have come,\u0027 she said.\n \"You\u0027re damn right!\u0027 Woody said. \u0027 the hell are YOUT \u0027\u0027m Julia Stanford.\u0027 She was, almost stammering in her nervousness. \u0027. I mean who are you really?\u0027 She started to say something, then shook her head.\n \"I ... My mother was Rosemary Nelson. Harry Stanford was my father.\u0027 The group looked at one another. \u0027 you have any proof of that Tyler asked. 151 She swallowed. \u0027 don\u0027t think I have any real proof.\" course you don\u0027t,\u0027 Woody snapped. \u0027 do you have the nerve to -T Kendall interrupted. \u0027 is rather a shock to all of us, as you can imagine. If what you\u0027re saying is true, then you\u0027re ... you\u0027re our half sister.\u0027 Julia nodded. \u0027\u0027re Kendall.\u0027She turned to Tyler. \u0027\u0027re Tyler.\u0027 She turned to Woody. \u0027 you\u0027re Woodrow. They call you Woody.\"\n \"As People Magazine could have told you,\u0027 Woody said sarcastically.\n Tyler spoke up. \u0027\u0027m surd you can understand our position, Miss ... er ...

I came here hoping to meet my family: v Kendall was studying her. \u0027 is your mothert \u0027 passed away. When I read that our father died .. \u0027 decided to look us up,\u0027Woody said mockingly.\n Tyler spoke. \u0027 say you have no legal proof of who you are.\"9l ... I suppose not. I didn\u0027t even think about 152 t. But there are things. I couldn\u0027t possibly know about unless I had heard them from my mother.\" examplet Marc said. She stopped to think. \u0027 remember my mother used to talk about 4 greenhouse in the back. She loved plants and flowers, and she would spend hours there.\u0027 Woody spoke up. \u0027 of that greenhouse were in a lot of magazines.\" else did your mother tell\n [email protected]!\u0027\n Tyler asked. \u0027, there were so many things! She loved to talk about all of you and the good times you used to have.\u0027 She thou t for a moment. \u0027 was the day s - gh he took you on the swan boats when you were very young. One of you almost fell overboard. I don\u0027t remember which one.\u0027 Woody and Kendall looked over at Tyler. \u0027 was the one,\u0027 he said. \u0027 took you shopping at Filene\u0027s. One of you got lost, and everyone was in a panic.\u0027 Kendall said slowly, \u0027 got lost that day.\"?

She looked at Woody. \u0027 and Mother went to the Charlestown Navy Yard to see the USS Constitution, and you wouldn\u0027t leave. She had to drag you away.\u0027 She turned to Kendall. \u0027 in the Public 153 Garden one day, you picked some flowers and were almost arrested.\u0027 Kendall swallowed. \u0027\u0027s right! They were all listening to her intently now, fascinated. \u0027 day, Mother took all of you to the Natural History museum, and you were terrified of the mastodon and sea serpent skeleton.\u0027 Kendall said slowly, \u0027 of us slept that night.\u0027 Julia turned to Woody. \u0027 Christmas, she took you skating. You fell down and broke a tooth. When you were seven years old, you fell out of a tree and had to have your leg stitched up. You had a scar.\u0027 Woody said reluctantly, \u0027 still do.\u0027 , She turned to the others.\n \"One of you was bitten by a dog. I forgot which one. My mother rushed you to the emergency room at Massachusetts General.\u0027 Tyler nodded. \u0027 had to have- shots against rabies.\u0027 Her words were coming out in a torrent now. \u0027, when you were eight years old, you ran away. You were going to Hollywood to become an actor. Your father was furious with you. He made you go to your room without -dinner. Mother sneaked some food up to your room.\u0027 Woody nodded, silent. \u0027 ... I don\u0027t know what else I can tell you. I ... She suddenly remembered something. \u0027 have a photograph in my purse.\u0027 She opened her purse and took it out. She handed the picture to Kendall. 154 They all gathered around to look at it. It was a picture of the three of them when they were children, standing next to an attractive young woman in a governess\u0027s uniform.\n \"Mother gave me that.\u0027 Tyler asked, \u0027 she leave you anything else?\" She shook her head. \u0027. I\u0027m sorry. She didn\u0027t want anything around that reminded. her of Harry Stanford.\" you, of course,\u0027 Woody said.\n She turned to him, defiantly. \u0027 don\u0027t care whether you believe me or not. You don\u0027t understand ... I ... I was so hoping -\u0027 Slid, broke off.\n Tyler spoke. \u0027 my sister said, your sudden appearance is rather a shock for us. I mean ... someone appearing out of nowhere and claimingto be a member of the family ... you can see our problem. I think we need a littl e time to discuss this.\" course, I understand.\" are you staying?, \u0027 the Tremont House.\" don\u0027t you go back there,? We\u0027ll have a car take you. And we\u0027ll be in touch shortly.\u0027 She nodded. \u0027 right.\u0027 She looked at each of them for a moment, and then said softly, \"No matter what you think - you\u0027re my family.\"\u0027ll walk you to the door,\u0027 Kendall said. She smiled. \u0027\u0027s all right. I can find my own way. I feel as-if I know every inch of this house.\u0027 155 They watched her turn and walk out of the room. Kendall said,\u0027Welll It ... it looks as though we have a sister.\u0027 11 don\u0027t believe it,\u0027 Woody retorted. \u0027 seems to me ... \u0027 Marc began. They were -all talking at once. Tyler raised a hand. \u0027 isn\u0027t getting us anywhere. Let\u0027s look at this logically. In a sense, this person is on trial here and we\u0027re her jurors. It\u0027s up to us to determine her innocence or guilt. In a jury trial, the decision must be unanimous. We must all agree.\u0027 Woody nodded.\n \"Right.\u0027 Tyler said, \u0027 I would like to cast the first vote. I think the lady is a fraud! \u0027 fraud? How can she be?\u0027Kendall demanded. \u0027 couldn\u0027t possibly know all those intimate details about us if she weren\u0027t real.\u0027 Tyler turned to her. \u0027 how many servants worked in this house when we were childrent Kendall looked at him, puzzled.\n \"Why?\", right? And some -of them would have known everything this young lady told us. Over the years, there have been maids, chauffeurs, butlers, chefs. Any one of them could have given her that photograph as well.\" mean ... she could be in league with someone?2 \"One or more,\u0027 Tyler said. \u0027\u0027s not forget that there\u0027s an enormous amount of money involved.\u0027 156 \u0027 says she doesn\u0027t want the money.\n Marc reminded them. Woody nodded. \u0027, that\u0027s what she says.\u0027 He looked at Tyler. \"But how do we prove she\u0027s a fake? There\u0027s no way that - \u0027 is a way,\u0027 Tyler said thoughtfully. They all turned to him.\n \"How?\u0027 Marc asked. \u0027\u0027ll,,have the answer for you tom6rrow.\u0027 Simon Fitzgerald said slowly, \u0027 you saying that Julia Stanford has appeared after all these yearst - \u0027 woman who claims she\u0027s Julia Stanford has appeared.\u0027 Tyler corrected him. \u0027 you don\u0027t believe hert Steve asked.\n \"Absolutely not. The only so-called -proof of her identity that she offered were some incidents from our childhood that at least a dozen former employees could have been aware of and an old photograph that really doesn\u0027t prove a thing. She could be in league with any one of them. I intend to prove she\u0027s a fraud.\u0027 Steve frowned. \u0027 do you. propose to do that?\" I t s ve I \u0027 ry simple. I want a DNA test done.\u0027 Steve Sloane was surprised. \u0027 would mean exhuming your father\u0027s body.\".\u0027 Tyler turned to Simon Fitzgerald. \u0027 that be a problemt \u0027 the circumstances, I could probably obtain an exhumation order. Has she agreed to this test?\u0027 157 \u0027 haven\u0027t asked her yet. If she refuses, it\u0027s an affirmation that she\u0027s afraid of the results! He hesitated. \u0027 have to confess that I don\u0027t like doing this. But I think it\u0027s the only way we can determine the truth.\u0027 Fitzgerald was thoughtful for a moment.\u0027Very well.\u0027 He turned to Steve, \u0027 you handle thist \u0027 c9urse.\u0027 He looked at Tyler. \u0027\u0027re probably familiar with the procedure. The next of kin - in this case, any of the deceased\u0027s children - has to apvly to the coroner\u0027s office for an exhumation permit. You\u0027ll have to tell them the reason for the request. If it\u0027s approved, the coroner\u0027s office will contact the funeral home and give them permission to go ahead. Someone from the coronees office has to be present at the exhumation! \u0027 long will this take?\u0027 Tyler asked. \u0027\u0027d say three or four days to get an approval. Today is Wednesday. We should be able to exhume the body on Monday.\"! Tyler hesitated. \u0027\u0027re going to need. a DNA expert, someone who will be convincing in a courtroom, if it ever goes that far. I was hoping you might know someone! . Steve said, J know just the man. His name is Perry Winger.\n He\u0027s here in Boston. He\u0027s given expert testimony in trials all over the country. I\u0027ll call him.\"\u0027d appreciate it. The sooner we get this over with, the better it will be for all of us! 158 -ten O\u0027clock the following morning, Tyler walked to the Rose Hill library, where Woody, Peggy, Kendall and Marc were waiting. At Tyler\u0027s side was a stranger. 61 want you to meet Perry Winger,\u0027 Tyler said. \u0027 is hetwoody asked.\n \"He\u0027s our DNA expert.\u0027 Kendall looked at Tyler. \u0027 in the world do we need a DNA expert fort Tyler said, \u0027 prove that this stranger, who so conveniently appeared out of nowhere, is an impostor. I have no intention of letting her get away with this.\u0027 [email protected] re going to dig the old man upon\u0027Woody asked. \u0027\u0027s right. I have our attorneys working on the exhumation order now. If the woman is our half sister, the DNA will prove it. If she\u0027s not - it will prove that, too. Marc said, \u0027\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t understand about this DNA.\u0027 Perry Winger cleared his throat.\n \"Simply put, deoxyribonucleic acid - or DNA - is the molecule of heredity. It contains each individual\u0027s unique genetic code., it be extracted from traces of blood, semen, saliva, hair roots, and even bone. Traces of it can last in a corpse for more than fifty years.\" see. So it is really quite simple,\u0027 Marc said. Perry Winger frowned.\n \"Believe me, it is not. There are two types of DNA testing. A PCR test, which takes three days to get results, and the more complex RFLP 159 test, which takes six to eight weeks. For our purposes, the simpler test will be sufficient.\" do you do the test?\u0027 Kendall asked. \u0027 are several steps. First, the sample is collected and the DNA is cut into fragments. The fragments are sorted by length by placing them on a bed of gel and applying an electric current. The DNA, which is negatively charged, moves toward the positive and, several hours later, the fragments have arranged themselves by length.\u0027 He was just getting warmed up. \u0027 chemicals are used to split the DNA fragments apart, then the fragments are transferred to a nylon sheet, which is immersed in a bath, and radioactive probes -\u0027 The eyes of his listeners were beginning to glaze over. \u0027 accurate is this testt Woody interrupted. \u0027\u0027s one hundred percent accurate in deteriniffing if the man is not the father. If the test is positive, it\u0027s ninety-nine point nine percent aecurate. Woody turned to his brother. \u0027, you\u0027re a judge. Let\u0027s say for the sake of argument that she really is Harry Stanford\u0027s child. Her mother and our father were never married. Why should she be entitled to anything?\" the law,\u0027 Tyler explained, \u0027if our father\u0027s paternity is established, she would be entitled to an equal share with the rest of us.\" I say let\u0027s go ahead with the damned DNA test and expose her!\u0027 160 0\",Tyler, Woody, Kendall, Marc and Julia were seated a table in the dining-room restaurant at the Tremont House. Peggy remained behind at Rose Hill. \u0027 this talk about digging up a body gives me the creeps,\u0027 she said. Now the group was facing the woman claiming to -be Julia Stanford. 11 don\u0027t understand. what you\u0027re asking me to do.\"\u0027s really very simple,\u0027 Tyler informed her. \u0027 doctor will take a skin sample from you to compare with our father\u0027s. If the DNA molecules match, it\u0027s positive proof that you\u0027re really his daughter. On the other hand, if you\u0027re not willing to take the test ..\n \"I ... I don\u0027t like it.\u0027 Woody closed in. \u0027 nott \u0027 don\u0027t know.\u0027 She shuddered. \u0027 idea of digging up my father\u0027s body to ... to ...\" prove who you are.\u0027 She looked into each of their faces. \u0027 wish all of you would - \u0027?\"\u0027s no way I can convince you, is theret \u0027,\" Tyler said. \u0027 to take this test.\u0027 There was a long silence. \u0027 right. I\u0027ll do it.\u0027 t The exhumation order had been more difficult to obtain than anyone had anticipated. Simon Fitzgerald had spoken to the coroner personally. 161 \u0027! For God\u0027s sake, Simon! I can\u0027t do that! Do you know what a stink that would cause? I mean, we aren\u0027t dealing with John Doe here; we\u0027re dealing with Harry Stanford. If this ever leaked out, the media would have a field day!\", this is important.\n Billions of dollars are at stake here. So you make sure it doesn\u0027t leak out.\"\u0027t there some other way you can ... T \u0027\u0027m afraid not. The woman is very convincing.\u0027 .\u0027But the family is not convinced.\".\" you think she\u0027s a fraud, Simont \u0027, I don\u0027t know. But my opinion doesn\u0027t matter. In fact, none of our opinions matters. A court will demand proof, and the DNA test will provide that.\u0027 The coroner shook his head. \u0027 knew old Harry Stanford. He would have hated this. I really shouldn\u0027t let ...\u0027 - \u0027 you will.\u0027 The coroner sighed. \u0027 suppose so.\n Would you do me a favort \u0027 course.\" this quiet. Let\u0027s not have a media circus.\" have my word. Top secret. I\u0027ll have just the family there.\" do you want to do thist \u0027 would like to do it on Monday.\u0027 162 The coroner sighed again. \u0027 right. I\u0027ll call the neral home. You owe me one, Simon.\" won\u0027t forget this.\u0027 At nine o\u0027clock Monday morning, the entrance to the section of Mount Auburn Cemetery where Harry Stanford\u0027s body was buried was temporarily closed off \u0027 maintenance repairs\u0027. No strangers were allowed into the grounds. Woody, Peggy, Tylei\u0027, Kendall, Marc, Julia, Simon Fitzgerald, Steve Sloane, and Dr. Collins, a representative from the coroner\u0027s office, stood at the site of Harry Stanford\u0027s grave, watching four employees of the cemetery raise , his coffin. Perry Winger waited off to the side. When the coffin reached ground level, the foreman turned to the group. \u0027 do you want us to do nowt \u0027 it, please,\u0027 Fitzgerald said. He turned to Perry Winger. \u0027 long will this taket \u0027 more than a minute. I\u0027ll just get a quick skin sample.\u0027 I \u0027 right,\u0027 Fitzgerald said.\n He nodded to the foreman. \u0027 ahead.\u0027 The foreman and his assistants began to unseal the coffin. I \u0027 don\u0027t want to see this,\u0027 Kendall said.\n \"Do we have tot \u0027!\u0027 Woody told her. \u0027 really do.\u0027 They all watched, fascinated, as the lid of the coffin 163 was slowly removed and pushed to one side. They stood there, staring down. \u0027, my God!\u0027 Kendall exclaimed.
