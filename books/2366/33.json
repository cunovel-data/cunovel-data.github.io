The woman is insane. She\u0027s carrying on so badly that they have to have her locked away in the violent ward.\u0027 Tyler felt a sharp sense of relief. \u0027\u0027m sorry to hear that.\", I wanted to ease your mind and let you know that she\u0027s no longer any danger to you or your family! I appreciate that,\u0027 Tyler said. And he did. Tyler went to his room and telephoned Lee. There was a long delay before Lee answered. \u0027?\u0027 Tyler could hear voices in the background. 61-\u003d?V \"Who is this?\"\u0027s Tyler.\", yeah. Tyler.\u0027 He could hear the tinkling of glasses. \u0027 you having a party, Leet \u0027-huh. Do you want to join just Tyler wondered who was at the party. \u0027 wish I could. I\u0027m calling to tell you to get ready to go on that trip we talked about.\" Lee laughed. \u0027 mean, on that great big white yacht to St. Tropez?\" \"That\u0027s right.\". I can be ready anytime,\u0027 he said mockingly. \u0027, I\u0027m serious.\", come off it, Tyler. Judges don\u0027t have yachts. I have to go now. My guests are calling me.\" a minute!\u0027 Tyler said desperately. \u0027 you know who I am?\", you\u0027re -\"\u0027m Tyler Stanford. My father was Harry Stanford.\u0027 There was a moment of silence. \"Are you kidding me?9 \u0027. I\u0027m in Boston now, settling up the estate.\" \"My God! You\u0027re that Stanford. I didn\u0027t know. I\u0027m sorry. I ... I\u0027ve been hearing stuff on the news, but I didn\u0027t pay much attention. I never figured it was you., \u0027\u0027s all right.\" really meant it about taking me to St. Tropez, didn\u0027t you?\" course I did. We\u0027re going to do a lot of things together,\u0027 Tyler said. \u0027 is, if you-want to.\" certainly dop Lee\u0027s voice was suddenly filled with enthusiasm. \u0027, Tyler, this is really great news ...\u0027 When Tyler replaced the receiver, he was smiling. Lee was taken care of. Now, he thought, it\u0027s time to take care of my ha4(sister. Tyler went into the library where Harry Stanford\u0027s gun collection was kept, opened the case, and removed a mahogany box. From a drawer below the case, he took out some ammunition. He put the ammunition in his pocket and carried the wooden box upstairs to, his bedroom, locked the door behind him and opened the box. Inside were two matching Ruger revolvers, Harry Stanford\u0027s favorites. Tyler removed one, carefully loaded it, and then placed the extra ammunition and the box containing the other revolver in his bureau drawer. One shot will do it, he thought. They had taught him to shoot well at the military school his father had sent him to. Thank you, Father. Next, Tyler picked up a telephone directory and looked for Steve Sloane\u0027s home address. 280 Newbury Street, Bostom Tyler made his way to the garage, where there were half a dozen cars. He chose the black Mercedes as being the least conspicuous. He opened the garage door and listened to see if the noise had disturbed anyone. There was only silence. On the drive to Steve Sloane\u0027s house, Tyler thought about what he was about to do. He had never physically committed a murder before. But this time he had no choice. Julia Stanford was the last obstacle between him and his dreams. With her gone, his problems would be over. Forever, Tyler thought. He drove slowly, careful not to attract attention. When he reached Newbury Street, Tyler cruised past Steve\u0027s address. A few cars were parked on the street, but no pedestrians were around. He parked the cat a block away and walked back to the house. He rang, the doorbell and waited. Julia\u0027s voice came through the door. \u0027 is iff \u0027\u0027s Judge Stanford.\u0027 Julia opened the door. She looked at him in surprise. \u0027 are you doing here? Is anything [email protected]\" \u0027, not at all,\u0027 he said easily. \u0027 Sloane asked me to have a talk with you. He told me you were here. May I come int \u0027, of course.\u0027 Tyler walked into the hall and watched Julia close the door behind him. She led the way into the living room. \u0027 isn\u0027t here,\u0027 she said. \u0027\u0027s on his way to San Remo.\" know.\u0027 He looked around. \u0027 YOU alone? Isn\u0027t there a housekeeper or someone to stay with yout \u0027. I\u0027m safe here. May I offer you something?, \u0027, thanks.\" did you want to talk to me abouff \u0027 came to talk about you, Julia. I\u0027m disappointed in you.\" ... T \u0027 should never havecome here. Did you really think you could walk in and try to collect a fortune that doesn\u0027t belong to yout She looked at him a moment. \u0027 I have a right to -, \u0027 have a right to nothing!\u0027 Tyler snapped. \u0027 were you all those years when we were being humiliated and punished by our father? He went out of his way to hurt us every chance he got. He put us through hell. You didn\u0027t have to go through any of that. Well, we did, and we deserve the money. Not you.\" ... what do you want me to dot Tyler gave a short laugh. \u0027 do I want you to do? Nothing. You\u0027ve done it already. You damned . spoiled everything, do you know that \u0027 don\u0027t understand.\u0027 \u0027\u0027s really quite simple.\u0027 He took out the revolver. \u0027\u0027re going to disappear.\u0027 She took a step back. \u0027 I ... \u0027\u0027t say anything. Let\u0027s not waste time. You and I are going on a little trip.\u0027 She stiffened. \"What if I won\u0027t go?\", you\u0027ll be going. Dead or alive. Suit yourself.\u0027 In the moment of silence that followed, Tyler heard his voice boom out from the next room. \u0027, you\u0027ll be going- Dead or alive.

Steve was holding a tape recorder. Lieutenant Kennedy said, \u0027 me the gun, judge.\u0027 Tyler froze for an instant, then he forced a smile. \"Of course. I was just trying to scare this woman into getting out of here. She\u0027s a firmid, you know.\u0027 He put the gun in the detective\u0027s outstretched hand. \u0027 tried to claim part of the Stanford estate. Well, I wasn\u0027t about to let her get away with it. So I .. \u0027\u0027s over, judge,\u0027 Steve said. ,\u0027What are you talking about? You said Woody was responsible for ...\" wasn\u0027t up to planning anything as clever as this, and Kendall was already very successful. So I started checking up on you. Dmitri Kaminsky was killed in Australia, but the Australian police found your telephone number in his pocket. You used him to murder your father. You\u0027re the one who brought in Margo Posner and then insisted she was an impostor to throw suspicion off yourself. You\u0027re the one who insisted on the DNA test and arranged to have the body removed. And you\u0027re the one who put in the phony call to Timmons. You hired Margo Posner to impersonate Julia, then had her committed to a psychiatric ward.\u0027 Tyler looked around the room, and when he spoke, his voice was dangerously calm. \u0027 a phone nwnber on a dead man is yourevidence? I can\u0027t believe this! You set up your pitiful little trap based. on that? You don\u0027t have a shred of proof. My telephone number was in Dmitri\u0027s pocket because I thought my father might be in danger. I told Dmitri to be careful. Obviously, he wasn\u0027t careful enough. Whoever killed my father probably killed Dmitri. That\u0027s who the police should be looking for. I called Timmons because I wanted him to find out the truth. Someone impersonated him. I have no idea who. And unless you can find him and tie him to me, you have nothing. As far as Margo Posner is concerned, I really believed that she was our sister. When she suddenly went crazy, going on a buying spree and threatening to kill us all, I persuaded her to go to Chicago. Then I arranged to have her picked up and committed. I wanted to keep all this out of the press to protect the family.\u0027 Julia said, \u0027 you came here to kill me.\u0027 Tyler shook his head. \u0027 had no intention of killing you. You\u0027re an impostor. I just wanted to scare you away- \u0027\u0027re lying.\u0027 He turned to the others. \"There\u0027s something else you might consider. IVs possible that none of the family is involved. It could be some insider who\u0027s manipulating this, someone who put in an impostor and planned to convince the family she was genuine and then split a share of the estate with her. That didn\u0027t occur to any of you, did iff He turned to Simon Fitzgerald. \u0027\u0027m going to sue you both for slander, and I\u0027m going to take away everything you\u0027ve got. These are my witnesses. Before I\u0027m through with you, you\u0027llwish you had never heard of me. I control billions, and I\u0027m going to use them to destroy you.\u0027 He looked at Steve. \u0027 promise you that your last act as a lawyer will be the reading of the Stanford will. Now, unless you want to charge me with carrying an unlicensed weapon, I\u0027ll be leaving.\u0027 The group looked at one another uncertainly. \u0027? Well, good evening, then.\u0027 They watched helplessly as he walked out the door. Lieutenant Kennedy was the first one to find his voice. \u0027 Goff he said. \"Do you believe that \u0027\u0027s bluffing,\u0027Steve said slowly.\u0027But we can\u0027t prdve it. He\u0027s right. We need proof. I thought he would crack, but I underestimated him.\u0027 Simon Fitzgerald spoke. \u0027 looks like our little plan backfired. Without Dmitri Kaminsky or the testimony of the Posner woman, we have nothing but suspicions.\" about the threat on my life?, Julia protested. Steve said, \u0027 heard what he said. He was just trying to, scare you because he thought you were an impostor. \u0027 wasn\u0027t just trying to scare me,\u0027 Julia said. \u0027 intended to kill me.\" \"I know. But there isn\u0027t a thing we can do. Dickens had it right: \"The law is a ass ... \" We\u0027re right back where we started.\u0027 Fitzgerald frowned. \"It\u0027s worse than that, Steve. Tyler meant what he said about suing us. Unless we canprove our charges, we\u0027re in trouble.\u0027 When the others had left, Julia said to Steve, \u0027\u0027m so sorry about all this. I feel responsible in a\u0027way. If I hadn\u0027t come ...\"\u0027t be silly,\u0027 Steve said. \"But he said he\u0027s going to ruin you. Can he do that Steve shrugged. \"We\u0027ll have to see.\u0027 Julia hesitated. \u0027, I\u0027d [email protected] to help you: He looked at her, puzzled. \u0027 do you mean?\", I\u0027m going to have a lot of money. I\u0027d like to give you enough so you can -\u0027 . He put his hands on her shoulders. \u0027 you, Julia. I can\u0027t take your money. I\u0027ll be fine.\" ... I \u0027\u0027t worry about it., She shuddered. \u0027\u0027s an evil man.\u0027 `It was very brave of you to do what you did.\" said there was no way to get him, so I thought if you sent him here, that could be the way to trap him.\" looks as though were the ones who fell into the trap, doesn\u0027t iff That night, Julia lay in her bed, thinking about Steve and wondering how she could protect him. I shouldn\u0027t have come, she thought, but if I hadn\u0027t come, I wouldn\u0027t have met him In the next room, Steve lay in bed, thinking about Julia. It was frustrating to think that she was lying in her bed with only a thin wall between them. What am I talking about? That wall is a billion dollars thick. Tyler was in an exuberant mood. On the way home, he thought about what had just taken place, and how he had outwitted them. They\u0027re pygmies trying to fell a giant, he thought. And he had no idea that these were once his father\u0027s thoughts. When Tyler reached Rose Hill, Clark greeted him. \u0027 evening, Judge Tyler. I hope you\u0027re well this evening.\" better, Clark. Never better.\" I get you anythingt \"Yes.
