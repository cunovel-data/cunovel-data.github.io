The cemetery certainly doesn\u0027t want that kind of bad pubficity. The coroner has ordered Dr. Collins to keep his mouth shut, and Perry Winger can be trusted not to talk.\u0027 @ Woody wasn\u0027t paying any attention. \u0027 don\u0027t know how the bitch did it!\u0027 he said. \u0027 she isn\u0027t going to get away with it!\u0027 He glared at the others. \u0027 suppose you don\u0027t think she arranged itt Tyler said slowly, \u0027\u0027m afraid I have to agree with you, Woody. No one else, possibly could have had a reason for doing this. The woman is clever and resourceful, and she\u0027s obviously pot working alone. I\u0027m not sure exactly what we\u0027re up against.\" are we going to do now?\u0027 Kendall asked. Tyler shrugged.\\n\\n \"Frankly, I don\u0027t know. I wish I did* I\u0027m sure she plans to go to court to contest the wilu \u0027 she have a chance of winning?\u0027 Peggy asked timidly. 165 \u0027\u0027m afraid she does. She\u0027s very persuasive. She had -some of us convinced.\" must be something we can do,\u0027 Marc exclaimed.\\n\\n \"What about bringing the police in on this?, \u0027 says they\u0027re already looking into the disappearance of the body, and they\u0027ve come to a dead end. No pun intended,\u0027 Tyler said. \u0027\u0027s more, the police want this kept quiet, or they\u0027ll have every weirdo in town turning up a body.\" can ask them to investigate this phony!\u0027 Tyler shook his head. \u0027 is not a police matter. It\u0027s a private -\u0027 He stopped for a moment, then said thoughtfully, \u0027 know ...\"?\" could hire a private investigator to try to expose her.\"\u0027s not a bad idea. Do you know onet \u0027, not locally. But we could ask Fitzgerald to find someone. Or ...\u0027 He hesitated. \u0027\u0027ve never met him, but I\u0027ve heard about a private detective the district attorney in Chicago uses a great deal.\\n\\n He has an excellent reputation.\u0027 Marc spoke up. \u0027 don\u0027t we find out if we can hire him?\u0027 Tyler looked around. \u0027\u0027s up to the rest of you.\" can we loset Kendall asked. \u0027 could be expensive,\u0027 Tyler warned. Woody snorted. \u0027? We\u0027re talking about billions of dollars.\u0027 166 Tyler nodded. \u0027 course. You\u0027re right.\"\u0027s his namet Tyler frowned. \u0027 can\u0027t remember. Simpson. Simmons ... No, that\u0027s not it. It sounds something like that. I can call the district attorney\u0027s office in Chicago.\u0027 The group watched as Tyler picked up the telephone @on the console and dialed a number. Two minutes later, he was speaking to an assistant district attorney. \u0027 is Judge Tyler Stanford. I xifiderstand that your office retains a private detectivelrom, time to time who does excellent work for you. His name is something like Simmons or \u003d\u0027 The voice on the other end said, \u0027, you must mean Frank Timmons.\"! Yes, that\u0027s it.\u0027 Tyler looked at the others and smiled. \u0027 wonder if you could give me his telephone number so I can contact him directly?\u0027 After he wrote down the telephone number, Tyler replaced the receiver. He turned to the group, and said, \"Well., then, if we all agree, I\u0027ll try to reach him.\u0027 Everyone nodded.\\n\\n The following afternoon, Clark came into the drawing room, where the group was waiting. \u0027. Timmons is here.\u0027 He was a man in his forties, with a pale complexion and the solid build of a boxer. He had a broken nose and bright, inquisitive eyes. He looked from Tyler to 167 Marc and Woody, questioningly. \u0027 Stanford?\u0027 Tyler nodded. \u0027\u0027m Judge Stanford.\" Timmons,\u0027 he said. \u0027 have a seat, Mr. Timmons.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\u0027 He sat down. \u0027\u0027re the one who telephoned, right?\".\"\\n\\n \"To be honest, I don\u0027t know what I can do for you. I don\u0027t have any official connections here.\" is purely unofficial,\u0027 Tyler assured him. \u0027 merely want to trace the background of a young woman.\" told me on the phone she claims to be your half sister, and there\u0027s no way of running a DNA test.\"\u0027s right,\u0027 Woody said. He looked at the group. \u0027 you don\u0027t believe she\u0027s your half sistert There was a moment\u0027s hesitation. \u0027 don\u0027t,\u0027 Tyler told him. \u0027 the other hand, it\u0027s just possible that she is telling the truth. What we want to hire you to do is provide irrefutable evidence that she is either genuine or a fraud.\" enough. It will cost you a thousand dollars a day and -expenses.\u0027 Tyler said, \u0027 thousand ... T \u0027\u0027ll pay it.\u0027 Woody cut in.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll need all the information you have on this woman.\u0027 Kendall said, \"There doesn\u0027t seem to be very much.\u0027 168 IQ\\n\\n [email protected]\\n\\n /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */\\n\\n spoke up. \u0027 has no proof of any kind.

Woody spoke up. \u0027 had an air with our father and got pregnant. She ran away and had a baby girl.\u0027 He shrugged.\\n\\n \"She disappeared.\" see. And this woman claims to be her child?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\u0027s not a lot to go on.\u0027 He sat there, thinking.\\n\\n Finally he looked up. \u0027 right. I\u0027ll see what I can do.\"\u0027s all we ask,\u0027 Tyler said. The first move he made was to go to the Boston Public Library and read all the microfiche about the twenty-six-year-old scandal involving Harry Stanford, the governess, and Mrs. Stanford\u0027s suicide. There was enough material for a novel. His next step was to visit Simon Fitzgerald. \u0027 name is Frank Timmons. I\u0027m \u0027 know who you are,. Mr. Timmons. Judge Stanford asked me to cooperate with you. What can I do for yout \u0027 want to trace Harry Stanford\u0027s illegitimate daughter. She\u0027d be about twenty-eight, right?\u0027 169 \u0027. She was born August ninth, 1969, at St. Joseph\u0027s Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her mother named-her Julia.\u0027 He shrugged. \u0027 disappeared. I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s all the information we have.\"\u0027s a beginning,\u0027 he said. \u0027\u0027s a beginning.\u0027 Mrs. Dougherty, the superintendent at St. Joseph\u0027s Hospital in Milwaukee, was a gray-haired woman in her sixties. \u0027, of course, I remember,\u0027 she said. \u0027 could I ever forget it? There was a terrible scandal. There were stories in all the newspapers. The reporters here found out who she was, and they wouldn\u0027t leave the poor girl alone.\"\\n\\n \"Where did she go when she and the baby left heret \u0027 don\u0027t know. She left no forwarding address.\" she pay her bill in full before she left, Mrs. Dougherty?\" a matter of fact ... she didn\u0027t.\" do you happen to remember thatt .\u0027Because it was so sad. I remember she sat in that very chair you\u0027re sitting in, and she told me that she could pay only part of her bill, but she promised to send me the money for the r9st of it. Well, that was against hospital rules, of course, but I felt so sorry for her, she was so ill when -she left here, and I said yes.\"\\n\\n \"And did she send you the rest of the moneyt \u0027 certainly did. About two months later. Now 170 I recall she had gotten a job at some secretarial service.\" wouldn\u0027t happen to remember where that was, would yout \u0027. Goodness, that was about twenty-five years ago, Mr. Timmons.\". Dougherty, do you keep all your patients\u0027 records on filet \u0027 course.\u0027 She looked up at him. \u0027 you want me to go through the recordst He smiled pleasantly. \u0027 you wouldn\u0027t mind.\" it help Rosemaryt \u0027 could mean a great deal to her.\" you\u0027ll excuse me.\" Mrs. Dougherty left the office. She returned fifteen minutes later, holding a paper in her hand. \u0027 it is. Rosemary Nelson. The return address is, The Elite Typing Service. Omaha, Nebraska.\u0027 The Elite Typing Service was run by a Mr. Otto Broderick, a man in his sixties. \u0027 hire so many temporary employees,\u0027 he protested. \u0027 do you expect me to remember someone who worked here that long agot \u0027 was a rather special case. She was a single woman, in her late twenties, in poor health. She had just had a baby and \u0027!\"\u0027s right. Why do you remember hert 171 \u0027, I like to associate things, Mr. Timmons. Do you know what mnemonics 1st \u0027.\", that\u0027s what I use. I associate words. There was a movie out called Rosemary\u0027s Baby. So when Rosemary came in and told me she had a baby, I put the two things together and * * *\" long was Rosemary Nelson with yout \u0027, about a year, I guess.\\n\\n Then the press found out who she was, somehow, and they wouldn\u0027t leave her alone. She left town in the middle of the night to get away from them.\". Broderick, do you have any idea where Rosemary Nelson went when she left here?\", I think. She wanted a warmer climate. I recommended her to an agency I knew there.\" I have the name of that agencyt \u0027. It\u0027s the Gale Agency. I can remember it becauge I associated it with the big storms they have down in Florida every year.\" Ten days after his meeting with the Stanford family, he returned to Boston. He had telephoned ahead, and the family was waiting for him.\\n\\n They were seated in a semicircle, facing him as he entered the drawing room at Rose Hill. \u0027 said you had some news for us, Mr. Timmons,\" Tyler said. \u0027\u0027s right.\u0027 He opened a briefcase and pulled out 172 papers. \u0027 has been a most interesting case,\u0027 e said. \u0027 I began \"Cut to the chase,\u0027 Woody said impatiently. \u0027 she \",a fraud or noff He looked up. \u0027 you don\u0027t mind, Mr. Stanford, I y uld like to present this in in own way.\u0027 Tyler gave Woody a warning look. \u0027\u0027s fair enough. Please go ahead.\u0027, They watched him consult his noiis. \u0027 Stanford governess, Rosemary Nelson, had a female child sired by Harry Stanford. She and the child went to Omaha, Nebraska, where she went to work for The Elite Typing Service. Her employer told me that she had difficulty with the weather. \u0027, I traced her and her daughter to Florida, where she worked for the Gale Agency. They moved around a great deal. I followed the trail to San Francisco, where they were living up to ten years ago. That was the end of the trail. After that, they disappeared! \u0027 looked up. \u0027\u0027s it, Timmonst Woody demanded. \u0027 lost the trail ten years agot \u0027, that is not it! He reached into his briefcase and took out another paper. \u0027 daughter, Julia, applied for a driver\u0027s license when she was seventeen! \u0027 good is that Marc asked. \u0027 the state of California d rivers are required to have their fingerprints taken.\u0027 He held up a card. \u0027 are the real Julia Stanford\u0027s fingerprints! 173 Tyler said, excitedly, \u0027 see! If they match -\u0027 ,\u0027Then she would really be our sister.\u0027 Woody interrupted. He nodded. \u0027\u0027s right. I brought a portable fingerprint kit with me, in case you want to check her out now. Is she heret Tyler said, \u0027\u0027s at a local hotel. I\u0027ve been talking to her every morning, trying to persuade her to stay here until we get this resolved.\"\u0027ve got her!\u0027 Woody said. \u0027\u0027s get over there!\u0027 Half an hour later, the group was entering a hotel room at the Tremont House. As they walked in, she was packing a suitcase. \u0027 are you going?\u0027 Kendall asked. She turned to face them.\\n\\n \"Home. It was a mistake for me to come here in the first place.\u0027 Tyler said, \u0027 can\u0027t blame us for ... T She turned on him, furious. \u0027 since I arrived, I\u0027ve been met with nothing but suspicion. You think rcame here to take some money away from you. Well, I didn\u0027t. I came because I wanted to find my family. I ... never mind.\u0027 She returned to her packing. _Tyler said, \u0027 is Frank Timmons. He\u0027s a private detective.\u0027 She looked up. \u0027 what? Am I being arrested?\", ma\u0027am.\\n\\n Julia, Stanford obtained a driver\u0027s license in San Francisco when she was seventeen years old.\u0027 174 : stopped. \u0027\u0027s right. Is that against the law?\", ma\u0027am. The point is \u0027 point is\u0027- Tyler interrupted -\u0027that Julia Stan- \u0027,\u0027ford\u0027s fingerprints are on that license.\u0027 She looked at them. \u0027 don\u0027t understand. What ... T Woody spoke up. \u0027 want to check them against your fingerprints.\u0027 Her lips tightened. \u0027! I won\u0027t allow id\" you saying that you won\u0027t kf us take your fingerprintst \u0027\u0027s right.\" not?\u0027 Marc asked. Her body was rigid. \u0027 all of you make me feel like I\u0027m some kind of criminal. Well, I\u0027ve had enough! I want you to leave me alone.\u0027 Kendall said gently, \u0027 is your chance to prove who you really are. We\u0027ve been as upset by all this as you have. We would like to settle it.\" She stood there, looking into their faces, one by one. Finally she said wearily, \u0027 right. Let\u0027s get this over with.\".\". Timmons ..\\n\\n . `:4\u003c3\" Tyler said. \u0027.\u0027 He took out a small fingerprint kit and set it up on the table. He opened the ink pad. \u0027, if you\u0027ll just step over here, please.\u0027 The others watched as she walked over to the table. He picked up her hand and, one by one, pressed her fingertips onto the pad.\\n\\n Next, hepressed them onto a 175 piece of white paper. \u0027. That wasn\u0027t so bad, was itt He placed the drivees license next to the fresh fingerprints. The group walked over to the table and looked down at the two sets of prints. They were identical. Woody\u0027 was the first to speak.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re ... the ... same.\u0027 Kendall was looking at her with a mixture of feelings. \u0027 really are our sister, aren\u0027t yout She was smiling through her tears. \u0027\u0027s what I\u0027ve been trying to tell you.\u0027 Everybody -was suddenly talking at once. \u0027\u0027s incredible ... !\" all these years .. \u0027 didn\u0027t your mother ever come back ... T \u0027\u0027m sorry we gave you such a bad time.\u0027 Her smile lit up the room. \u0027? s all right.\\n\\n Everything\u0027s all right now.\u0027 Woody picked up the fingqrprint card and looked at it in awe. \u0027 God! This is a billion-dollar card.\u0027 He put the card in his pocket. \u0027\u0027m going to have it bronzed.\u0027 Tyler turned, to the group. \u0027 calls for a real celebration! I suggest we all go back to Rose Hill.\u0027 He turned to her and smiled. \u0027\u0027ll give you a welcome home party. Let\u0027s get you checked out of here.\u0027 She looked around at them, and her eyes were 176 shining. It, s like a dream come true. I finally have a family!\u0027 Half an hour later they were back at Rose Hill, and she was settling into her new room. The others were downstairs, talking excitedly. \u0027 must feel as though she\u0027s just been through the Inquisition,\u0027 Tyler mused. \u0027 has,\u0027 Peggy replied. \u0027 dodi know how she stood it.\u0027 Kendall said, \u0027 wonder how she\u0027s going to adjust to her new life.\" same way we\u0027re all going to adjust,\u0027 Woody said dryly.\\n\\n \"With a lot of champagne and caviar.\u0027 Tyler rose. \u0027, for one, am glad it\u0027s finally settled. Let me go up and see if she needs any help.\u0027 He went upstairs and walked along the corridor to her room. He knocked at her door and called loudly, \"\u0027s open. Come in.\u0027 He stood in the doorway, and, they stared silently at each other. And then Tyler carefully closed the door, held out his hands, and broke into a slow grin. When he spoke, he said, \u0027 did it, Margo!
