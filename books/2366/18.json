Steve sighed. \u0027\u0027m not sure. It\u0027s the Stanford family.\\n\\n They puzzle me! Simon Fitzgerald snorted. \u0027 the club.\" keep coming back to the same question, Simon, but I can\u0027t find the answer to it-.\"\u0027s the question?\" family was anxious to exhume Harry Stanford\u0027s body so they could check his DNA against the woman\u0027s. So I think we have to assume that the only possible motive for getting rid of the body would be to ensure that the woman\u0027s DNA could not be checked against Harry Stanford\u0027s. The only one who could have anything to gain from that would be the woman herself, if she were a fraud! \u0027.\" yet this private detective, Frank Timmons - I 212 checked with the district attorney\u0027s -)ffice in Chicago, and he has a great reputation - ca ie up with fingerprints that prove she is the real 3ulia Stanford., My question is, who the hell dug up Harry Stanford\u0027s body and whyt \"That\u0027s a billion-dollar question.

I The line went dead.\\n\\n Tyler sat there a moment. Then he thought, He wouldn\u0027t have said he missed me if he didn\u0027t mean it. With the exception of Woody and Peggy, the family was gathered in the drawing room at Rose Hill. Steve studied their faces. Judge Stanford seemed very relaxed. Steve Slanced at Kendall. She seemed unnaturally tense. Her husband had come up from New York the day before for the meeting. Steve looked over at Marc. The Frenchman was good-looking, a few years younger than his wife. And then there was Julia. She seemed to be taking her acceptance into the family very calmly. I would have expected someone who had just inherited a billion dollars or so to be a little more excited, Steve thought. He glanced at their faces again, wondering if one of them was responsible for having Harry Stanford\u0027s body stolen, and if so, which one? And why\u0027?\\n\\n Tyler was speaking. \u0027. Sloane, I\u0027m familiar with the probate laws in Illinois, but I don\u0027t know how much they differ from the laws in Massachusetts. We 214 were wondering whether there - wasn\u0027t some way to expedite the procedure.\u0027 Steve smiled to himself. I should have made Sinwn take that bet. He turned to Tyler. \u0027\u0027re already working on it, Judge Stanford.\u0027 Tyler said pointedly, \u0027 Stanford name might be useful in speeding things up.\u0027 He\u0027s right about that, Steve thought. He nodded. \u0027\u0027ll do everything I can. If it\u0027s at all possible to There were voices from the staircase. \u0027 shut up, you stupid bitch! I don\u0027t want to hear another word. Do you understandt Woody and Peggy came down the stairs and into the room. Peggy\u0027s face was badly swollen, and she had a black eye. Woody was grinning, and his eyes were bright. \u0027, everybody. I hope the party\u0027s not over.\u0027 The group was looking at Peggy in shock. Kendall rose. \u0027 happened to yout \u0027. I ... I bumped into a door.\u0027 Woody took a seat. Peggy sat next to him. Woody patted her hand and asked solicitously, \u0027 you all right, my deart Peggy nodded, not trusting herself to speak. \u0027.\u0027 Woody turned to the others. \u0027, what did I miss?\u0027 Tyler looked at him disapprovingly. \u0027 just asked Mr. Sloane if he could expedite the probating of the will.\u0027 Woody grinned.\\n\\n \"That would be nice.\u0027 He turned to 215 Peggy. \u0027\u0027d like some new clothes, wouldn\u0027t you, darlingt \u0027 don\u0027t need any new clothes,\u0027 she said timidly. \u0027\u0027s right.

She doesn\u0027t have anything to talk about, do yout Peggy got up and ran out of the room. \u0027\u0027ll see if she\u0027s all right,\u0027 Kendall said. She rose and hurried after her. My Godf Steve thought. If Woody behaves like this in front of others, what must it be like when he and his wife are alone? Woody turned to Steve. \u0027 long have you been with Fitzgerald\u0027s law firmt, \u0027 years.\" they could stand working for my father, I\u0027ll never know.\u0027 Steve said carefully, \u0027 undeistand your father was ... could be difficult.\u0027 Woody snorted.\\n\\n .\u0027Difficult? He was a two-legged monster. Did you know he had nicknames for all of us? Mine was Charlie. He named me after Charlie Mccarthy, a dummy that a ventriloquist named Edgar Bergen had. He called my sister Pony, because he said she had a face like a horse. Tyler was called ..\\n\\n .\u0027 Steve said, uncomfortably, \u0027 really don\u0027t think you should -\u0027 Woody grinned. \u0027\u0027s all right. A billion dollars heals a lot of wounds.\u0027 216 Steve rose. \u0027, if theres nothing else, I think I had better be going.\u0027 He could not wait to get outside, into the fresh air. Kendall found Peggy in the bathroom, putting a cold cloth to her swollen cheek.\\n\\n \"Peggy9 Are you all right?\u0027 Peggy turned. \u0027\u0027m fine. Thank you. I ... I\u0027m sorry about what happened down there.\u0027 -- \u0027\u0027re apologizing?. You should be furious. How long has he been beating YOUT \u0027 doesn\u0027t beat me,\u0027 Peggy said obstinately. 11 bumped into a door.\u0027 Kendall moved closer to her. \u0027, why do you put up with this? You don\u0027t have to, you know.\u0027 There was a pause. \u0027, I do.\u0027 Kendall looked at her, puzzled. \u0027 She tumea. \u0027 I love him.\u0027 She went on, the words pouring out. \u0027 loves me, too. Believe me, he doesn\u0027t always act like this. The thing is, he - some- times he\u0027s not himself.\" mean, when he\u0027s on drugs.\u0027 6NO3 \u0027 .. \u0027!\" .. Peggy hesitated. \u0027 suppose so.\" did it startt \u0027 ... right after we got married.\" Peggy\u0027s voice 217 was ragged. \u0027 started because of a polo game. Woody fell off his pony and was badly hurt. While he was in the hospital, they gave him drugs to help with the pain. Aey got him started.\u0027 She looked at Kendall, pleadingly. \u0027 you see, it wasn\u0027t his fault, was it? After Woody got out of the hospital, he ... he kept on using drugs. Whenever I tried to get him to quit, he would ... beat me.\", for God\u0027s sake!\\n\\n He needs help! Don\u0027t you see that? You can\u0027t do this alone. He\u0027s a drug addict. What does he take? Cocamet \u0027.\u0027 There was a small silence.\\n\\n \"Heroin.\" God! Can\u0027t you make him get some help?\"\u0027ve tried.\u0027 Her voice was a whisper. \u0027 don\u0027t know how I\u0027ve tried! He\u0027s gone to three rehabilitation hospitals.\u0027 She shook her head. \u0027\u0027s all right for a while, and then ... he starts again. He ... he can\u0027t help it.\u0027 Kendall put her arms around Peggy. \u0027\u0027m so sorry,\u0027 she said. Peggy forced a smile. \u0027\u0027m sure Woody will be all tight. He\u0027s trying hard. He really is.\u0027 Her face lit up. \u0027 we were first married, he was so much fun to be with. We used to laugh all the time. He would bring me little presents and Her eyes filled with tears. \u0027 love him so much!\" there\u0027s anything I can do.. \u0027 you,\u0027 Peggy whispered. \u0027 appreciate that.\u0027 Kendall squeezed her hand. \u0027\u0027ll talk again.\u0027 218 Kendall started down the stairs to jo . the others. She was thinking, When we were children, bef6re Mother died, we made such wonderful pkms \u0027\u0027re going to be a famous designer, Sis, and rm going to be the world\u0027s greatest athlete!\u0027 And the sad part of it, Kendall thought, is that he could have been. And now this. - Kendall was not sure if she felt-more sorry for Woody or for Peggy. As Kendall reached the bottom of the stairs, Clark approached her, carrying a tray with a letter on, it.\\n\\n \"Excuse me, Miss. Kendall. A messenger just delivered this for you.\u0027 He handed her the envelope. Kendall looked at it in surprise. \u0027 ... T She nodded. \u0027 you, Clark.\u0027 Kendall opened the envelope, and as she began to read the letter, she turned pale. \u0027!\u0027 she said, under her breath. Her heart was pounding, and she felt a wave of dizziness. She stood there, bracing herself against a table, trying to catch her breath. After a moment, she turned and walked into the drawing, room, her face pale. The meeting was breaking up. \u0027 ...\u0027 Kendall forced herself to appear calm. \u0027 I see you for a momentt - He looked at her, concerned. \u0027, certainly.\u0027 Tyler asked Kendall, \u0027 you all right?\" She forced a smile. \u0027\u0027m fine, thank you.\u0027 She took Marc\u0027s hand and led-him upstairs. When 219 they entered the bedroom, Kendall closed the door. Marc said, \u0027 is iff Kendall handed him the envelope. The letter read: Dear Mrs. [email protected] Congratulations! Our Wild Animal Protection Association was delighted to read of your good fortune. We know how interested you are in the work we are doing, and we are counting on your further support. Therefore, we would appreciate it if you would deposit I million US dollars in our, numbered bank account in Zurich within the next ten days We look forward to hearing from you shortly. As in the other letters, all the Es were broken. \u0027 bastards!\u0027 Marc exploded. - \u0027 did they know I was heret Kendall asked. Marc said bitterly, \u0027 they had to do was pick up a newspaper.\u0027 He read the letter again and shook his head. \u0027 aren\u0027t going to quit. We have to go to the police.\"!\u0027Kendall cried.\u0027Wecan\u0027t! It\u0027s too late! Don\u0027t you see? It would be the end of everything. Everything!\u0027 Marc took her in his arms and held her tightly. \u0027 right. We\u0027ll find a way.\u0027 But Kendall knew that there was no way. 220 It had happened a few months earlier, on what had started out to be a glorious spring day. Kendall had gone to a friend\u0027s birthday party in Ridgefield, Connecticut. It had been a wonderful party, and Kendall had chatted with old friends. She had had a glass of champagne. In the middle of a conversation, she had suddenly looked at her watch. \u0027, no! I had no idea it was so late.\\n\\n Marc is waiting for me.\u0027 There were hasty good-byes, and Ketiaall had gotten into her car and driven off. Driving back to New York, she had decided to take a winding country road over to 1684.1 She was traveling at almost fifty miles per hour as she rounded a sharp curve and spotted a car parked on the right side of the road. Kendall automatically swerved to the left. At that moment, a woman carrying a handful of freshly picked flowers started to cross the narrow road. Kendall tried frantically to avoid her, but it was too late. Everything seemed to happen in a blur. She heard a sickening thud as she hit the woman with her left front fender. Kendall brought the car to a screeching stop, her whole body trembling violently. She ran back to where the woman was lying in the road, covered with blood. Kendall stood there, frozen.\\n\\n Finally she bent down and turned the woman over, and looked into her sightless eyes. \u0027, my God!\u0027 Kendall whispered. - She felt the bile rising in her throat. She looked up, desperate, not knowing what to do.\\n\\n She swung around in a panic. There were no cars in sight. She\u0027s dead, Kendall 22j, thought. I can\u0027t help her. This was not my fault, but they\u0027ll accuse me of reckless dnink driving. My blood will show alcohol.\\n\\n hi go to prison!\u0027 She took one last look at the body of the woman, then hurried back to her car. The left front fender was dented, and there were blood spots on it. I\u0027ve got to put the car away in a garage, Kendall thought. The police will be searching for it. She got into the car and drove off. For the rest of the drive into New York, she kept looking into the rearview mirror, expecting to see flashing red lights and to hear the sound of a siren. She drove into the garage on Ninety-sixth Street where she kept her car. Sam, the owner of the garage, was talking [email protected] Red, his mechanic. Kendall got out of the car.\\n\\n \"Evenin\u0027, Mrs. Renaud,\u0027 Sam said. \u0027 ...

The two men were staring at the fender. When Kendall got home and told Marc about the terrible thing that had happened, he took her in his arms and said,\u0027Oh, my God! Darling, how could ... T Kendall was sobbing.\\n\\n \"I ... I could(In\u0027t help it. She started across the road right in front of me. She ... she had been picking flowers and \u0027!

You should have seen her face. It was awful.\u0027 He held her for a long time, until she quieted down. When Kendall spoke, she said tentatively, \u0027 ... do we have to go to the policet He frowned. \u0027 do you men?\u0027 She was fighting hysteria. \u0027, it\u0027s over, isn\u0027t it? Nothing can bring her back. What good would it do for them to punish me? I didn\u0027t mean to do it. Why couldn\u0027t we just pretend it never happenedt \u0027, if they ever traced -\u0027 - \u0027 can they? There was no one around..\" about your car? Was it damagedt 223 \u0027\u0027s a dent.

I\u0027d lose my business, everything I\u0027ve built up all these years, and for what? For something that\u0027s already done! It\u0027s over!\u0027 She began to sob again. He held her close. \u0027! We\u0027ll see. We\u0027ll see.\u0027 The morning papers gave the story a big play. What gave it added drama was the fact that the dead woman had been on her way to Manhattan to be married. The New York Times covered it as a straight news story, but the Daily News and Newsday played it up as a heart-tugging drama: Kendall bought a copy of each newspaper, and she became more and more horrified at what she had done. Her mind was filled with all the terrible ifs. if I hadn\u0027t gone to Connecticut-for my-friends birthday ... If I had stayed home that day ... If I hadn\u0027t had anything to drink.\\n\\n . If the woman had picked the flowers a few seconds earlier or a few seconds later ... rm responsible for murdering another human being!\\n\\n Kendall thought of the terrible grief she had caused the woman\u0027s family, and her franck\u0027s family, and she felt sick to her stomach again.\\n\\n According to the newspapers, the police were asking 224 for information from anyone who might have a clue about the hit-and-run. They have no way offinding me, Kendall thought. All I have to do is act as if nothing happened.\u0027 When Kendall went to the garage to pick up her car the next morning, Red was there. 11 wiped the blood off the car,\u0027 he-.said. \u0027 you want me to fix the dentt . Of course! She should have thought of it sooner. \u0027, please.\u0027 Red was looking at her strangely. Or was it her imagination? \u0027 and I talked about it last night,\u0027 he said. It\u0027s funny, you know. A deer should have done a lot more damage. 9 1 .\\n\\n Kendall\u0027s heart began to beat wildly. Her mouth was Isuddenly so dry she could hardly speak..\u0027It was ... a small deer.\u0027 Red nodded laconically.\u0027Must have been real small.\u0027 Kendall could feel his eyes on her as she drove out of the garage. When Kendall walked into her office her secretary, Nadine, took one look at her and said, \u0027 happened to yout Kendall froze. \u0027 ... what do you meant \u0027 look shaky. Let me get you some coffee.\".\u0027 225 Kendall walked over to the mirror.\\n\\n Her face looked pale and drawn. They\u0027re going to know just by looking at me! Nadine came into the office with a cup of hot coffee. \u0027. This will make you feel better.\u0027 She looked at Kendall curiously. \u0027 everything all right?\" ... I had a little accident yesterday,\" Kendall said. \u0027? Was anyone hurt?\u0027 In her mind, she could see the face of the dead woman. \u0027. I ... I hit a deer.\" about your car?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s being repaired.\"\u0027ll call your insurance company.\", no, Nadine, please don\u0027t.\u0027 Kendall saw the surprised look in Nadine\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n It was two days later that the first letter came: Dear Mrs. Ren\u003d4 rm the chairman of the Wild Animal Protection Association, which is in desperate need, I\u0027m sure that you would like to help us out.

I would strongly suggest that the money be there within the nextfive days. 226 It was unsigned. All the Es in the letter were broken. Enclosed in the envelope was a newspaper clipping about the accident. Kendall read the letter twice. The threat was unmistakable. She agonized over what to do. Marc was right, she thought. I should have gone to the police. But now everything was worse.\\n\\n She was a fugitive. If they found her now, it would mean prison and disgrace, as well as the end of her business. At lunchtime, she went to her bank. \u0027 want to wire fifty thousand dollars to Switzerland.\u0027 When Kendall got home that evening, she showed the letter to Marc. He was stunned. \u0027 God!\u0027 he said. \u0027 could have sent thist \u0027 ... nobody knows.\u0027 She was trembling. \u0027, someone knows.\u0027 Her body was twitching. \u0027\"here was no one around, Marc!

The report of the accident has been in all the newspapers. Someone has put two and two together. I think the letter was a bluff, testing you.
