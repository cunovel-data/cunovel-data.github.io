The pilot pressed the microphone button. \u0027. Boeing eight nine five Papa is cleared for takeoff.

We\u0027ve lost them.\".\u0027 Harry Stanford leaned back in his seat and r .. There was nothing to worry about. They would be tracking the plane. He reviewed the situation 15 in his mind. It was really a question of what they knew and when they knew it. They were jackals following the trail of a lion, hoping to bring him down. Harry Stanford smiled to himself. They had underestimated the man they were dealing with. Others who had made that mistake had paid dearly for it. Someone would also pay this time. He was Harry Stanford, the confidant of presidents and kings, powerful and rich enough to make or break the economies of a dozen countries. The 727 was in the skies over Marseilles. The pilot spoke into the microphone. \u0027, Boeing eight nine five Papa is with you, climbing out of flight level one nine zero for flight level two three zero.\".\u0027 The R \u0027 reached San Remb shortly after dawn. Harry Stanford had fond memories of the city, but it had changed drastically. He remembered a time when it had been an elegant town with first-class hotels and restaurants, and a casino where black tie was required and where fortunes could be lost or won in an evening. Now it had succumbed to tourism, with loud-mouthed patrons gambling in their shirtsleeves. The Renault was approaching the harbor, twelve miles from the French-Italian border. There were two marinas at the harbor, Marina Porto Sole to the east, and Porto Communale to the west. In Porto Sole, a 16 marine attendant directed the berthing. In Porto Communale, there was no attendant. \u0027 one?\" Dmitri asked. \u0027 Communale,\u0027 Stanford directed. Ae fewer people around, the better. \u0027, sir.\u0027 A few minutes later, the Renault pulled up next to the Blue Skies, a sleek hundred-and7zghty-foot motor yacht.\n Captain Vacarro and the crew of twelve were lined UP on deck. The captain burned down the gangplank to greet the new arrivals. \u0027 morning, Signor Stanford,\u0027 Captain Vacarro said. \u0027\u0027ll take your luggage, and .. \u0027 luggage.

Our cabin boy got sick in Capri, and we took on this one. He\u0027s highly -\" rid of him,\u0027 Stanford ordered. The captain looked at him, puzzled. \u0027 ... ?\" him off.\n Let\u0027s get out of here.\u0027 Captain Vacaffo nodded. \u0027, sir.\u0027 Looking around, Harry Stanford was filled with an increasing -sense of foreboding. He could almost reach out and touch it. He did not want any strangers near him. Captain Vacarro, and his crew had been with him for years. He could trust them. He turned to look at the girl. Since Dmitri had picked her up at random, 17 here was no danger there. And as for Dmitri, his faithful bodyguard had saved his life. more than once.\n Stanford turned to Dmitri.-\u0027Stay close to me.\", sir.\u0027 Stanford took Sophia\u0027s arm. \u0027\u0027s go aboard, my dear.\u0027 - Dmitri Kaminsky stood on deck, watching the crew prepare to cast off. He scanned the harbor, but he saw nothing to be alarmed about. At this time of the morning, there was very little activity. The yacht\u0027s huge generators burst into life, and the vessel got under weigh. The captain approached Harry Stanford.\n \"You didn\u0027t say where we were heading, Signor Stanford.\u0027 ,, I didn\u0027t, did 1, captaint He thought for a moment. \u0027.\", sir.\" the way, I want you to maintain strict radio silence.\u0027 Captain Vacarro frowned. \u0027 silence? Yes, sir, but what if ... T Harry Stanford said, \"Don\u0027t worry about\u0027it. Just do it. And I don\u0027t want anyone using the satellite phones.\", sir. Will we be laying over in Portofinot \"I\u0027ll let you know, captain.\u0027 Harry Stanford took Sophia on a tour of the yacht. It was one of his prized possessions, and he enjoyed 18 vessel. It had a 91 Sbowm\u0027 it off. It was a breathtaking luxuriously appointed master suite with a sitting room and an office. The office was spacious and comfortably hirnished with a couch, several easy chairs, and a desk, , which was enough equipment to run a small town. On the wall was a large electronic map with a small moving boat showing the current position of the yacht. Sliding glass doors opened from the master suite onto an outside veranda deck furnished with a chaise longue and a table with four chairs. A tea k railing ran along the outside. On balmy days, it was Stanford\u0027s custom to have breakfast on the veranda.\n There were six guest staterooms, each with hand painted silk panels, picture windows, @and a bath with a Jacuzzi. The large library was done in koa wood. The dining room could seat sixteen guests. A fully equipped. fitness salon was on the lower deck. The yacht also contained a wine cellar and a theater that was ideal for running films. Harry Stanford had one of the world\u0027s greatest libraries of pornographic movies. T\"he furnishings throughout the vessel were exquisite, and the paintings -would have made any museum proud- \u0027, now you\u0027ve seen most of it,\u0027 Stanford told Sophia at the end of the tour. \u0027\u0027ll show you the rest tomorrow.1 She was awed. \u0027\u0027ve never seen anything like it! It\u0027s ... it\u0027s like a city!\u0027 Harry Stanford smiled at her enthusiasm. \u0027 19 steward will show you to your cabin. Make yourself comfortable. I have some work to do.\u0027 Harry Stanford returned to his office and checked the electronic map on the wall for the location of the yacht. Blue Skies was in the Ligurian Sea, heading northeast. 7hey won\u0027t know where Fve gone, Stanford thought. They\u0027ll be waiting for me at JFK When we get to Portofino, F11 straighten everything out. Thirty-five thousand feet in the air, the pilot of the 727 was getting new instructions. \u0027 eight nine five Papa, you are cleared directly to Delta India November upper route forty as filed.\". Boeing eight nine five Papa is cleared direct Dinard upper route forty as filed.\u0027 He turned to the copilot. \u0027 clear.\u0027 The pilot stretched, got up, and walked to the cockpit door. He looked into the cabin. \"How\u0027s our passenger doing?\u0027 the copilot asked. \u0027 looks hungry to me.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/morning-noon-and-night/page-2.html","bookId":2366,"book":{"id":2366,"title":"Morning, Noon and Night","description":"Storyline: \n Cruising on his yacht, Harry Stanford, one of the world\u0027s wealthiest men, drowns under mysterious circumstances.
