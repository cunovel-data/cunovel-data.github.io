The ballroom- was packed. Every seat was occupied, and there were standees in the rear. Backstage there was a stir, and Kendall turned to see what was happening. Two uniformed policemen were making their way toward her.\n Kendall\u0027s heart began to race. One of the policemen said, \u0027 you Kendall Stanford Renaudt \u0027.\"I\u0027m placing you under arrest for the murder of Martha Ryan.\"!\u0027 she screamed.1 didn\u0027t mean to do it! It was an accident! Please! Please! Please ... !\u0027 She woke up in a panic, her body trembling. It was a recurring nightmare. I can\u0027t go on like this, Kendall thought. I can\u0027d I have to do something. She wanted desperately to talk to Marc. He had reluctantly returned to New York. \u0027 have a job to dop darling. They won\u0027t let me take any more time off.\" understand, Marc. I\u0027ll be back there in a few days. I have to get a show ready.\u0027 Kendall wits leaving for New York that morning, but before she went there was something she felt she had to do. The conversation with Woody had been very disturbing. He\u0027s blaming his problems on Peggy. Kendall found Peggy on the veranda. \u0027 morning,\" Kendall said. \u0027 morning.\u0027 Kendall took a seat opposite her. \u0027 have to talk to you.\" It was awkward. \u0027 had a talk with Woody. He\u0027s in bad shape. He ... he thinks that you\u0027re the one who\u0027s been supplying him with heroin.\" told you thatt There was a long pause. \u0027, it\u0027s true.\u0027 Kendall stared at her in disbelief. \u0027? I ... I don\u0027t understand. You told me you were trying to get him off drugs. Why would you want to keep him addictedt IL ou really don\u0027t understand, do yout Her tone was bitter. \u0027 live in your own little god damned world. Well, let me tell you something, Miss. Famous Designer!, I was a waitress when Woody got me pregnant. I never expected Woodrow Stanford to marry me. And do you know why he did? So he could feel he was better than his father. Well, Woody married me, all right. And everybody treated me like dirt. When my brother, Hoop, came down for the wedding, they acted like he was some kind of trash.\". \u0027 tell you the truth, I was dumbfounded when your brother said he wanted to marry me. I didn\u0027t even know if it was his baby. I could have been a good wife to Woody, but no one even gave me a chance. To them I was still a waitress. I didn\u0027t lose the baby, I had an abortion. I thought maybe Woody would divorce me, but he didn\u0027t. I was his token symbol of how democratic he was. Well, let me tell you something, lady. I don\u0027t need that. I\u0027m as good as you or anyone else.\u0027 Each word was a blow. \u0027 you ever love Woody?\u0027 Peggy shrugged. \u0027 was good-looking and fun, but then he had that bad fall during the polo game, and everything changed. The hospital gave him drugs, and when he got out, they expected him to stop taking them. One night, he was in pain, and I said, \"I have a little treat for you.\" And after that, whenever he was in pain, I gave him his little treat. Pretty soon he needed it, whether he was in pain or not. My brother is a pusher, and I was able to get all the heroin I needed. I made Woody beg me for it. And sometimes I\u0027d tell I was out of it just to watch him sweat and cry - oh, how Mr. Woodrow Stanford needed me! He wasn\u0027t so ig \u0027hi hand mighty then! I goaded him into hitting me, and then he\u0027d feel terrible about what he had done, and he\u0027d come crawling back to me with gifts. You sm. when Woody is off dope, I\u0027m nothing. When he\u0027s on it, I\u0027m the one who has the power. He may be a Stanford, and maybe I was only a waitress, but I control him.\u0027 Kendall was staring at her in horror.\n \"Your brother\u0027s tried to quit, all right. When it got real bad, his friends would get him into a detox center, and I\u0027d go visit him and watch the great Stanford suffer the agonies of hell. And each time he came out, I\u0027d be waiting for him with my little treat. It was payback time.\u0027 Kendall was finding it hard to breathe. \u0027\u0027re a monster,\u0027 she said slowly. \u0027 want you to leave.\" bet! I can\u0027t wait to get out of this place.\u0027 She grinned. \u0027 course, I\u0027m not leaving for nothing. How much of a settlement will I gett \u0027 it is,\u0027 Kendall said; \u0027 will be too much. Now get out of here.\".\u0027 Then she added with an affected tone, \u0027\u0027ll have my lawyer call your lawyer.\"\u0027s really leaving met \u0027.\" means ...\u0027 \u0027 know what it means, Woody. Can you handle it?\u0027 He looked at his sister and smiled. \u0027 think so. Yes. I think I can.\"\u0027m sure of it.\u0027 He took a deep breath. \u0027, Kendall.\n I would never have had the courage to get rid of her.\u0027 She smiled. \u0027 are sisters fort That afternoon, Kendall left for New York. The fashion showing would be in one week. Clothing is the single biggest business in New York. A successful fashion designer can have an effect on the economy all around the world. A designer\u0027s whim has a far-flung impact on everyone from cotton pickers in India to Scottish weavers to silkworms in China and Japan. It has an effect on the wool industry and the silk industry. The Donna Karans and Calvin Kleins and Ralph Laurens are a major economic influence, and Kendall had arrived in that category. It was ru- mored that she was about to be named the Women\u0027s Wear Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, the most prestigious award a designer could receive.. Kendall Stanford Renaud led a busy life. In September she looked at large assortments of fabrics, and in October she selected the ones she wanted for her new designs. December and January were devoted to designing the new fashions, and February to refining \"\"Iheni In April, she was ready to show her fall coi- lection. Kendall Stanford Designs was located at 550 Seventh Avenue, sharing the building with Bill Blass and Oscar de la Renta. Her next showing was going to be at the Bryant Park tent, which could seat up to a thousand people. When Kendall arrived at her office, Nadine said, 619 ve got good news. The showing is completely booked\" \u0027 you,\u0027 Kendall said absently. Her mind was on other things. \u0027 the way, there\u0027s a letter marked urgent for you on your desk. It was just delivered by messenger.\u0027 The words sent a jolt through Kendall\u0027s body. She walked over to, her desk and looked at the envelope.\n The return address was Wild Animal Protection Association, Park Avenue, New York, New York She stared at it for a long time. There was no 3000 Park Avenue. Kendall opened the letter with trembling fingers.\n Dear Mrs. Renaud, My Swiss banker informs me that he has not yet received the million dollars that my association requested In view of your delinquency, I must inform you that our needs have been increased to 5 million dollars. If thispayment is made, Ipromise we will not bother you again. You have fifteen days to deposit the money in our account.\n Ifyoufail to do so, I regret that we shall have to communicate with the appropriate authorities. It was unsigned. Kendall stood there in a panic, reading it over an dover, again and again. Five million dollars!\n It\u0027s impossible, she\n [email protected]\n I can never raise that kind of money that quickly. What a fool I was! When Marc came home that night, Kendall showed him the letter. \u0027 million dollars!\u0027 he exploded. \u0027\u0027s ridiculous! Who do they think you aret \u0027 know who I arn,\u0027 Kendall said. \u0027\u0027s the problem. I\u0027ve got to get hold of some money quickly.\n But howt \u0027 don\u0027t know ... I suppose a bank would loan you money against your inheritance, but I don\u0027t, like the idea of ...\", it\u0027s my life I\u0027m talking about. Our fives. I\u0027m going to see about getting that loan.\u0027 George Meriwether was the vice president in charge of the New York Union Bank. He was in his forties and had worked his way up from a junior teller. He \u0027 ambitious man. One day I\u0027ll be on the board of \"s an [email protected],,zkrectors, he thought, and after that ... who knows? His thoughts were interrupted by his secretary. \u0027. Kendall Stanford is here to see you.\u0027 He felt a small frisson of pleasure. She had been a good customer as a successful designer, but now she was one of the wealthiest women in the world. He had tried for several years to get Harry Stanford\u0027s account, without success. And now ... \u0027 her in,\" Meriwether told his secretary. When Kendall walked into his office, Meriwether rose and greeted her with a smile and a warm handshake. \u0027\u0027m so pleased to see you,\u0027 he said. \u0027 sit down. Some coffee, or something strongert \u0027. thanks,\u0027 Kendall said. \u0027 want to offer my condolences on the death of your father.\u0027 His voice was suitably grave. \u0027 you.\"\n \"What can I do for yout He knew what she was going to say. She was going to turn her billions over to him to invest ... \u0027 want to borrow some money.\u0027 He blinked. \u0027 beg your pardont \u0027 need five million dollars.\" He thought rapidly. According to the newspapers, her share of the estate should be more than a billion dollars. Even with taxes ... He smiled.\n \"Well, I don\u0027t think there will be any problem.

She was gone. When Kendall returned to the office, Nadine said excitedly, \u0027 have to talk to you.\u0027 She was in no mood to hear Nadine\u0027s problems. \u0027 is itt Kendall asked. \u0027 husband called me a few minutes ago. His company is transferring him to Paris. So, I\u0027ll be leaving.\"\u0027re go ... going to Parist Nadine beamed. \u0027! Isn\u0027t that wonderful? I\u0027ll be sorry to leave you. But don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll stay in touch.\u0027 So it was Nadine. But there\u0027s no way to prove it. First the mink coal and now Paris. With five million dollars, she can afford to live anywhere in the world How do I handle this? Ifilellher that Iknow, she\u0027lldeny it. Maybe she\u0027ll demand more. Marc will know what to do.\n \"Nadine.. One of Kendall\u0027s assistants came in. \u0027! I have to talk to you about the bridge collection. I don\u0027t think we have enough designs for Kendall could bear no more. \u0027 me. I don\u0027t feel well.

When Kendall walked into her apartment, it was empty. Marc was working late. Kendall looked around at all the beautiful things in the room, and thought, They\u0027ll never stop until they take everything. They\u0027re going to bleed me dry.\n Marc was right. I should have gone to the police that night. Now I\u0027m a criminal. I\u0027ve got to confess. Now, while I have the courage. She sat there, thinking about what this was going to do to her, to Marc, and to her family. There would be lurid headlines, and a trial, and probably prison. It would be. the end of her career. But I can\u0027t go on like this, Kendall thought. rfl go crazy. Almost in a daze, she got up and walked into Marc\u0027s den. She remembered that he kept his typewriter on a shelf in the closet. She took it down and put it on the desk. She rolled a sheet of paper into the platen and began to type. To Whom It May Concern: My name is Kendall She stopped.
