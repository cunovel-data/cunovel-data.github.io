It was the first time since he had met Judge Tyler Stanford that his hand had not itched. It was a wonderful feeling of freedom. Still whistling, he pulled into the garage, and walked into the kitchen. Helen was waiting for him. \u0027 had a telephone call,\u0027 she said. \u0027 Mr. Jones. He said it was urgent.9 His hand began itching. 1w, Re had hurt some people, but he had done it for the love of his kids. He had committed some crimes, but \"At was for the -family.

When he had returned the phone call, he had protested. \u0027 can\u0027t do that, judge.\\n\\n You\u0027ll have to find someone else.\u0027 265 There had been a silence. And then, \u0027\u0027s the family?\u0027 The flight to Kansas City was uneventful.\\n\\n Judge Stanford had given him detailed instructions. \u0027 name is Julia Stanford You have her address and apartment number. She won\u0027t be expecting you. All you have to do is go there and handle her.\u0027 He took a taxi from the Kansas City Downtown Airport to downtown Kansas City.\\n\\n \"Beautiful day,\u0027 the taxi driver said. \u0027.\" did you come in from?\" York.

Would you come this way, pleaset The knife was a thing of beauty, about six inches long, with a sharp pointed end and serrated edges.\\n\\n \"Will this do?\"\u0027m sure it will,\u0027 Hal Baker said. \u0027 that be cash or charget \u0027.\u0027 His next stop was at a stationery store. Hal Baker studied the apartment building at 1425 Metcalf Avenue for five minutes, examining exits and entrances. He left and returned at 8 P. m., when it began to get dark. He wanted to make sure that if Julia Stan- ,ford had a job, she would be home from work. He had noted that the apartment building had no doorman. There was an elevator, but he took the stairs. It was not smart to be in small enclosed places. They were traps. He reached the third floor. Apartment 3B was down the hall on the left. The knife was taped to the inside pocket of his jacket. He rang the doorbell. A moment later, the door opened, and he found himself facing an attractive woman. \u0027.\u0027, She had a nice smile. \u0027 I help yout She was younger than he had expected, and he wondered fleetingly why Judge Stanford wanted her killed.

Hal Baker telephoned Tyler Stanford. \u0027\u0027m in Kansas City, but the girl is gone.\" do you mean, gonet \u0027 roommate says she left.\u0027 He was silent for a moment. \u0027 have a feeling she\u0027s headed for Boston.
