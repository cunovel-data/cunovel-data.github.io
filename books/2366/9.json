{"id":68993,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"it was raining in Paris, a warm July rain that sent pedestrians racing along the street for shelter or looking for nonexistent taxis. Inside the auditorium of a large gray building on a comer of Rue Faubourg St. Honor6, there was panic. A dozen half-naked models were running around in a kind of mass hysteria, while ushers finished setting, up chairs and carpenters pounded away at last-minute bits of carpentry. @veryone was screaming and gesticulating wildly, and the noise level \u0027 painful. In the eye of the hurricane, trying to bring order out of chaos,,was the maitresse herself, Kendall Stanford Renaud. Four hours before the fashion show 4s scheduled to begin, everything Nyas falling apart. Catastrophe: John Fairchild. of Wwas unexpectedly going to be in Paris, and there was no seat for him. Tragedy: the speaker system was not working. Disaster: one of the top models was ill. Emergency: two of the make-up artists were fighting backstage and were far behind schedule. 75 Calamity: all the seams on the cigarette skirts were tearing. In other words, Kendall thought wryly, everything is normal Kendall Stanford Renaud could have been mistaken for one of the models herself, and at one time she had been a model. She exuded carefully plotted elegance from her golden chignon to her Chanel pumps. Everything about her - the curve of her arm, the shade of her nail polish, the timbre of her laugh - bespoke well-mannered chic. Her face, if stripped of its careful make-up, was actually plain, but Kendall took pains to see that no one ever realized this, and no one ever did. She was everywhere at once. \"Who lit that runway, Ray Charlest \u0027 want a blue backdrop ...\" lining is showing. Fix it!\" don\u0027t want the models doing their hair and make-up in the holding area. Have Lulu find them a dressing room!\" Kendall\u0027s venue manager came hurrying up to her. \u0027, thirty minutes is too long! Too long! The show should be no more than twenty-five minutes.\u0027 She stopped what she was doing. \u0027 do you suggest, Scott?\" could cut a few of the designs and \u0027. I\u0027ll have the models move faster.\u0027 76 She heard her name called again, and turned. \"Kendall, we can\u0027t locate Pia. Do you want Tami to switch to the charcoal gray jacket with the trouserst \u0027. Give that to Dana. Give the cat suit and tunic to Tami.\" about the dark gray jersey?\" \"Monique. And make sure she wears the dark gray stockings.\u0027 Kendall looked at the board holding a set of Polaroid pictures of the models in a variety of gowns. When they were set, the pictures would be placed in a precise order. She ran a practiced eye over the board. \u0027\u0027s change this. I want the beige cardigan, out first, then the separates, followed by the strapless silk jersey, then the taffeta evening gown, the afternoon dresses W) th matching jackets ...\u0027 Two of her assistants hurried up to her. \u0027, we\u0027re having an argument about the seating. Do you want the retailers together, or do you want to mix them with the celebritiest The other assistant spoke up. \u0027 we could mix the celebrities and press together.\u0027 . Kendall was hardly listening. She had been up for two nights, checking everything to make sure nothing would go wrong. \u0027 it out yourselves,\u0027 she said. She looked around at all the activity and thought about the show that was about to begin, and the famous names from all over the world who would be there to applaud what she had created. I should thank 77 my father for all this. He told me I would never succeed ... She had always known that she wanted to be a designer. From the time she was a little girl, she had had a natural sense of style. Her dolls had the trendiest outfits in town. She would show off her latest creations for her mother\u0027s approval. Her mother would hug her and say, \u0027\u0027re very talented, darling. Someday you\u0027re going to be a very important designer.\u0027 And Kendall was sure of it. In school, Kendall studied graphic design, structural drawing, spatial conceptions, and color coordination. \u0027 best way to begin,\u0027 one of her teachers had advised her, \u0027 to become a model yourself. That way, you will meetall the top designers, and if you keep your eyes open, you will learn from them.\u0027 When Kendall had mentioned her dream to her father, he had looked at her and said, \u0027? A model! You must be joking!\u0027 When Kendall finished school, she returned to Rose Hill. Father needs me to run the house, she thought. There were a dozen servants, but no one was really in charge. Since Harry Stanford was away a good deal of the time, the staff was left to its own devices. Kendall tried to organize things. She scheduled the household activities, served as hostess for her father\u0027s parties, and did everything she could to make him comfortable. 78 She was longing for his approval. Instead, she suffered a barrage of criticisms. \u0027 hired that damned chef? Get rid of him.\" don\u0027t like the new dishes you bought. Where the hell\u0027is your taste ... 9\" told you you could redecorate my bedroom? Keep the hell out of there.\u0027 No matter what Kendall did, it was never good enough. __1 It was her father\u0027s domineering cruelty that finally drove her out of the house. It had always been a loveless household, and her father had paid no attention to his children, except to try to control and discipline them. One night, Kendall overheard her father saying to a visitor, \u0027 daughter has a face like a horse. She\u0027s going to need a lot of money to hook some poor sucker.\u0027 It was the final straw. The following, day, Kendall left Boston and headed for New York. Alone in her hotel room, Kendall thought, All right. Here I am in New York. How do I become a designer? How do I break into the fashion industry? How do I get anyone even to notice me? She remembered her teacher\u0027s advice. I\u0027ll start as a model. That\u0027s the way to begin. The following morning, Kendall looked through the yellow pages, copied a list of modeling agencies, and began making the rounds. I have to be honest with 79 them, Kendall thought. r1l tell them that I can stay with them only temporarily, until Iget started designing. She walked into the office of the first agency on her list. A middle-aged woman behind a desk said, \u0027 I help yout \u0027. I want to be a model.\" do I, dearie. Forget it.\"?\"\u0027re too tall.\u0027 Kendall\u0027s jaw tightened. \u0027\u0027d like to see whoever is in charge here.\"\u0027re looking at her. I own this joint.\u0027 The next half a dozen stops were no more successful. \u0027\u0027re too short.\" thin.\" fat.\" young.\" old.\" type.\u0027 By the end of the week, Kendall was getting desperate. There was one more name on her list. Paramount Models was the top modeling agency in Manhattan. There was no one at the reception desk. A voice from one of the offices said, \u0027\u0027ll be available next Monday. But you can have her for only one day. She\u0027s booked solid for the next three weeks.\u0027 Kendall walked over to the office and peered inside. 80 A \"Man in a tailored suit was talking on the phone. \u0027. I\u0027ll see what I can do.\u0027 Roxanne Marinack replaced the receiver and looked up. \u0027, we aren\u0027t looking for your type.\" Kendall said desperately, \u0027 can be any type you want me to be. I can be taller or I can be shorter. I can be younger or older, thinner Roxanne held up her hand. \u0027 it.\" I want is a chance. I really need this.\u0027 Roxanne hesitated. There was an appealing eagerness about the girl and she did have an exquisite figure. She was not beautiful, but possibly with the right make-up ... \u0027 you had any experiencet \"Yes. I\u0027ve been wearing clothes all my life.\u0027 Roxanne laughed. \u0027 right. Let me see your portfolio..\u0027 Kendall looked at her blankly. \u0027 portfolio?\u0027 Roxanne sighed. \u0027 dear girl, no self-respecting model walks around without a portfolio. It\u0027 s your bible. It\u0027s what your prospective clients are going to look at.\u0027 Roxanne sighed again. \u0027 want you to get two head shots - one smiling and one, serious. Turn around.\" \"Right.\u0027 Kendall began to turn. \u0027.\u0027 Roxanne studied her. \u0027 bad. I want a photo of you in a bathing suit or lingerie, whatever is the most flattering for your figure.\"\u0027ll get one of each,\u0027 she said eagerly. Roxanne had to smile at her earnestness. \u0027 right. 81 You\u0027re ... er ... different, but you might have a shot.\" you.\"\u0027t thank me too soon. Modeling for fashion magazines isn\u0027t as simple as it looks. It\u0027s a tough business.\"\u0027m ready for it.\"\u0027ll see. I\u0027m going to take a chance on you. I\u0027ll send you out on some go-sees.\"\u0027m sorry?, \u0027 go-see is where clients catch up on all the new models. There will be models from other agencies there, too. It\u0027s kind of a cattle call.\" can handle it.\u0027 That had been the beginning. Kendall went on a dozen go-sees before a designer was interested in having her wear his clothes. She was so tense, she almost spoiled her chances by talking too much.\" really love your dresses, and I think they would look good on me. I mean, they would look good on any woman, of course. They\u0027re wonderful! But I think they\u0027ll look especially good on me.\u0027 She was so nervous that she was stammering. The, designer nodded sympathetically. \"This is your first job, isn\u0027t itt \u0027, sir.\u0027 He had smiled. \u0027 right. I\u0027ll try you. What did you say your name wast \u0027 Stanford.\" She wondered if he would make 82 the connection between her and the Stanfords, but of course, there was no reason for him to. Roxanne had been right. Modeling was a toujlh business. Kendall had to learn to accept constant rejdction, go-sees that led nowhere, and weeks without work. When she did work, she was in make-up at six A. M., finished a shoot; went on to the next, and often didn\u0027t get through until after midnighl,, One evening, after a long day\u0027s shoot with half a dozen other, models, Kendall looked in a mirror and groaned, 11 won\u0027t be able to work tomorrow. Look how puffy my eyes are!\u0027 One of the models said, \"Put cucumber slices over your eyes. Or you can put some camomile tea bags in hot water, let them cool, and put them over your eyes for fifteen minutes.\u0027 In the morning, the puffiness was gone. Kendall envied [email protected] models who were in constant demand. She would hear Roxanne arranging their bookings: \u0027 originally gave Scaasi a secondary on Michelle. Call and tell them that she will be available, so I\u0027m moving them up to a tentative.\u0027 Kendall quickly learned never to criticize the clothes she was modeling. She became acquainted with some of the top photographers in the business, and had a photo composite made to go with her portfolio. She carried a model\u0027s bag filled with necessities - clothes, 83 make-up, a nail-care bag, and jewelry. She learned to blow-dry her hair upside down to give it more body, and to add curl to her hair with heated rollers. There was a lot more to learn. She was a favorite of the photographers, and one of them pulled her aside to give her some advice. \"Kendall, always save your smiling shots for the end of the shoot. That way, your mouth will have less creasing.\u0027 Kendall was becoming more and more popular. She was not the conventional drop-dead beauty that was the hallmark of most models, but she had something more, a graceful elegance. \u0027\u0027s got class,\u0027 one of the advertising agents said. And that summed it up. She was also lonely. From time to time she went out on dates, but they were meaningless. She was working steadily, but she felt she was no nearer to her goal than she was when she had first arrived in New York. I have to find a way to make contact with the top designers, Kendall thought. \u0027 have you booked for the next four weeks,\" Roxanne told her. \u0027 loves you.\" ...\", Kendall?\" \"I don\u0027t want to do this anymore.\u0027 Roxanne stared at her disbelievingly. \"What!\" want to do runway modeling.\u0027 84 Runway modeling was what most models aspired to. It was the most exciting and the most lucrative form of modeling. Roxanne was dubious. \u0027\u0027s almost impossible to break into and \u0027\u0027m going to.\u0027 Roxanne studied her. \u0027 really mean it, don\u0027t you?\".\u0027 Roxanne nodded. \u0027 right. If you\u0027fe serious about this, the first thing you have to do is learn to walk the beam.\" Roxanne explained. That afternoon, Kendall bought a six-foot narrow wooden beam, sandpapered it to avoid splinters, and placed it on her floor. The first few times she tried to walk on it, she fell off. This is not going to be easy, Kendall decided. But I\u0027m going to do it\u0027 Each morning she got up early and practiced walking the beam on the balls of her feet. Lead with the pelvis. Feel with the toes. Lower the heel. Day by day her balance improved. She strode up and back in front of a full-length mirror, with music playing. She learned to walk with a book on her head. She practiced changing rapidly from sneakers and shorts to high heels and an evening gown. 85 When Kendall felt that she was ready, she went back to Roxanne. \u0027\u0027m sticking my neck out for you,\u0027 Roxanne told her. \u0027 is looking for a runway model. I recommended you. He\u0027s going to give you a chance.\u0027 Kendall was thrilled. Ungaro was one of the most brilliant designers in the business. The following week, Kendall arrived at the show. She tried to seem as casual as the other models. Ungaro handed Kendall the first outfit she was to wear and smiled. \u0027 luck.\" \"Thanks.\u0027 When Kendall went out on the runway, it was as though she had been doing it all her life. Even the other models were impressed. The show was a big success, and from that time on- Kendall was a member of the elite. She started working with the giants of the fashion industry - Yves Saint Laurent, Halston, Christian Dior, Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, St. John. Kendall was in constant demand, traveling to shows all over the world. In Paris, the haute couture shows took place in January and July. In Milan, the peak months were March, April, May and June, while in Tokyo, shows peaked in April and October. It was a hectic, busy life, and she loved every minute of it. 86 Kendall kept working and she kept learning. She modeled the clothes of famous designers and thought about the changes she would make if she were the designer. She learned how clothes were supposed to fit, and how fabric was supposed to move and swing around the body. She learned about cuts and drapes and tailoring, and what body parts women wanted to hide, and what parts they wanted to show. She made sketches at home, and the ideas seemed to. flow. One day, she took a portfolio of her sketches to the head buyer at I Magnin\u0027s. The buyer was impressed. \u0027 designed theset she asked. , did! \u0027\u0027hey\u0027re good. They\u0027re very good! Two weeks later, Kendall went to work for Donna Karan as an Issistant and began to learn the business side of the garment trade. At home, she kept designing clothes. One year later, she had her first fashion show. It was a disaster. The designs were ordin4ry and nobody cared. She gave a second show, and no one came. I\u0027m in the wrong profession, Kendall thought. One day you\u0027re going to be a very famous designer. What am I doing wrong? Kendall wondered. The epiphany came in the middle of the night. Kendall awakened and lay in bed, thinking, I\u0027m designing dresses for models -to wear. I should be designing for real women with realjobs and realfamilies. Smari, but comfortable. Chic, but practical. 87 It took Kendall about a year to get her next show on, but it was an instant success. Kendall rarely returned to Rose Hill, and when she did, the visits were dreadful. Her father had not changed. If anything, he had gotten worse. \u0027\u0027t hooked anybody yet,, eh? Probably never will.\u0027 It was at a charity ball that Kendall met Marc Renaud. He worked at the international desk of a New York brokerage house, where he dealt with foreign currencies. Five years younger than Kendall, he was an attractive Frenchman, tall and lean. He was charming and attentive, and Kendall was immediately attracted to him. He asked her to dine the next evening, and that night Kendall went to bed with him. They were together every night after that. - One evening, Marc said,\u0027Kendall, I\u0027m madly in love with you, you know.\u0027 She said softly, \u0027\u0027ve been looking for you all my life, Marc.\" is a serious problem. You are a big success. I don\u0027t make anywhere near as much money as you. Perhaps one day -\" Kendall had put her finger to his lips. \u0027 it. You\u0027ve given me more than I could ever have hoped for.\u0027 On Christmas Day, Kendall took Marc to Rose Hill to meet her father. \u0027\u0027re going to marry him?\u0027 Harry Stanford exploded. \u0027\u0027s a nobody! He\u0027s marrying you for the money he thinks you\u0027re going to get.\u0027 If Kendall had needed any further reason to marry Marc, that would have been it. They got married in Connecticut the following day. And Kendall\u0027s marriage to Marc gave her happiness she had never known before. \u0027 mustn\u0027t let your father bully you,\u0027 he had told Kendall. \u0027 his life, he has used his money as a weapon. We don\u0027t need his money.\u0027 And Kendall had loved him for that. Marc was a wonderful husband - kind, considerate, and caring. I have everything, Kendall thought happily. The past is dead. She had succeeded in spite of her father. In a few hours, the fashion world was going to be focused on her talent. The rain had stopped. It was a good omen. The show was stunning. At its end, with music playing and flash bulbs popping, Kendall walked out onto the runway, took a bow and received an ovation. Kendall wished that Marc could have been in Paris with her to share her triumph, but his brokerage house had refused to give him the time off. 89 When the crowd had left, Kendall went back to her office, feeling euphoric. Her assistant said, \u0027 letter came for you. It was hand-delivered.\u0027 Kendall looked at the brown envelope her assistant handed her, and she felt a sudden chill. She knew what it was about before she opened it. The letter read: Dear Mrs. Renaud, I regret to inform you that the Wild Animal Protection Association is short Of funds again. We will need $100,000 immediately to cover our expenses. The money should be wired to account number 804072-A at the Cr6dit Suisse bank in Zurich. There was no signature. Kendall sat there, staring at it, numb. It\u0027s never go M*g to stop. The blackmail is never going to stop. Another assistant * came hurrying into the office. \u0027! I\u0027m so sorry. I just heard some terrible news.\u0027 I can\u0027t bear any more terrible news, Kendall thought. \u0027 ... what is it?\" was an announcement on Radio-T616 Luxembourg. Your father is ... dead. He drowned.\u0027 It took Kendall a moment for it to sink in. Her first thought was, I wonder what would have made him prouder? My success or the fact that I\u0027m a murderer?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/morning-noon-and-night/page-9.html","bookId":2366,"book":{"id":2366,"title":"Morning, Noon and Night","description":"Storyline: Cruising on his yacht, Harry Stanford, one of the world\u0027s wealthiest men, drowns under mysterious circumstances.
