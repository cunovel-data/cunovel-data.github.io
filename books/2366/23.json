{"id":69013,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"it was because of Kendall that Julia decided to go to Boston. Returning from lunch one day, Julia passed an exclusive dress shop, and in the window was an original design by Kendall. Julia looked at it for a long time. That\u0027s my sister, Julia thought. I can\u0027t blame her for what happened to my mother. And I can\u0027t blame my brothers. And suddenly she was filled with an overpowering desire to see them, to meet them; to talk to them, to have a family at last. When Julia returned to the office, she told. Max Tolkin that she would be gone for a few days. Embarrassed, she said, \u0027 wonder if I could have an advance on my salaryt Tolkin smiled. \u0027. You have a vacation coming. Here. Have a good time.\u0027 Will I have a good time? Julia wondered. Or am I making a terrible mistake? When Julia returned home, Sally had not arrived yet. I can\u0027t wait for her, Julia decided. If I don\u0027t go now, I\u0027ll never go. She packed her suitcase and left a note.. On the way to the bus terminal, Julia had second thoughts. What am I doing? Why did I make this sudden decision? Then she thought wryly, Sudden? It\u0027s taken me fourteen years! She was filled with an enormous sense of excitement. What was her family going to be like? She knew that one of her brothers was a judge, the other was a famous polo player, and her sister was a famous designer. It\u0027s afwnily of achievers, Julia thought, and who am P I hope they don\u0027t look down on me. Merely thinking about what lay ahead made Julia\u0027s heart skip a beat. She boarded a Greyhound bus and was on her way. When the bus arrived at South Station in Boston, Julia found a taxi. \u0027 to, ladyt the driver asked. And Julia completely lost - her nerve. She had intended to say, \u0027 Hill.\u0027 Instead, she said, T don\u0027t know.\u0027 The taxi driver turned around to look at her. \u0027, I don\u0027t know, either.\" you just drive around? I\u0027ve never been to Boston before.\u0027 He nodded. \u0027.\u0027 They drove west along Summer Street until they reached the Boston Common. The driver said, \u0027 is the oldest public park in the United States. They used to use it for hangings! And Julia could hear her mother\u0027s voice. V used to take the children to the Common in the winter to iceskate. Woody was a natural athlete. I wish you could have met him, Julia He was such a handsome boy. I always thought he was going to be the successful one in thefwnily.\u0027 It was as though her mother were with her, sharing this moment. They had reached Charles Street, the entrance to the Public Garden. The driver said, \u0027 those bronze ducklings? Believe it or not, they\u0027ve all got names.\" used to have picnics in the Public Garden. There are cute bronze ducklings at the entrance. They\u0027re named Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack.\u0027 Julia had thought that was so funny that she had made her mother repeat the names over an dover again. Julia looked at the meter. The drive was getting expensive. \u0027 you recommend an inexpensive hotelt \u0027. How about the Copley Square Hoteff \u0027 you take me there, pleaset \u0027.\u0027 Five minutes later, they pulled up in front of the hotel. \u0027 Boston, lady.\" you.\u0027 Am I going to enjoy it, or will it be a disaster? Julia paid the driver and went into the hotel. She approached the young clerk behind the desk. \u0027,\" he said. \u0027 I help you? \u0027\u0027d like a room, Please.\" \u0027. \u0027 long will you be staying?\u0027 She hesitated. An hour? Ten years? \u0027 don\u0027t know.\".\u0027 He checked the key rack. \u0027 have a nice single for you on the fourth floor.\" you.\u0027 She signed the register in a neat hand- Julia Stanford. The clerk handed her a key. \u0027 you are. Enjoy your stay., The room was small, but neat and clean. As soon as Julia unpacked, she telephoned Sally. \u0027? My God! Where are you?, \u0027\u0027m in Boston.\" you all rightt She sourided hysterical. \u0027. Whyt \"Someone came to the apartment, looking for you, and I think he wanted to kill you!\" are you talking about?\" had a knife and ... you should have seen tho look on his face - ..\u0027She was gasping for breath. \"When he found out I wasn\u0027t you, he ran!\" don\u0027t believe it!\" said he was with A.C. Nielsen, but I called their\u0027 office, and they never heard of him! Do you know anyone who would want to harm yout \u0027 course not, Sally! Don\u0027t be ridiculous! Did you call the police?\" did. Butthere wasn\u0027t much they could do except tell me to be more careful.\", I\u0027m just fine, so don\u0027t worry.\u0027 She heard Sally take a deep breath. \u0027 right. As long as you\u0027re okay. Juliat \u0027.\" careful, will you?\" course.\u0027 Sally and her inuiginatiorli Who in the world would want to kill me? \u0027 you know when you\u0027re coming back?\u0027 The same kind of question the clerk had asked her. \u0027.\"\u0027re there to see your family, aren\u0027t yout \u0027.\" I uck.\", Sally.\" in touch.\" will.\u0027 Julia replaced the receiver. She stood there, wondering what to do next. If I had any brains, I would get back on the bus and go, home. I\u0027ve been stalling. Did I come to Boston to see the sights? No. Icame here to meet my family. Am I going to meet them? No ... Yes ... She sat on the edge of the bed, her mind in a turmoil. What if they hate me? I must not think that. They\u0027re ing to love me, and Im going to love them. She looked the telephone and thought, Maybe it would be better see I called them. No. Then they might not want to me. She went to the closet and selected her best dress. If I don It do it now, I\u0027ll never do it, Julia decided. Thirty minutes later, she was in a taxi on her way to Rose Hill to meet her family.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/morning-noon-and-night/page-23.html","bookId":2366,"book":{"id":2366,"title":"Morning, Noon and Night","description":"Storyline: Cruising on his yacht, Harry Stanford, one of the world\u0027s wealthiest men, drowns under mysterious circumstances.
