Simon Fitzgerald was still very much alive, and at seventy-six, he was the dynamo that powered the office, with sixty attorneys working under him. He was perilously thin, with a full mane of white hair, and he walked with the sternly straight carriage of a military man. At the moment, he was pacing back and forth, his mind in a turmoil. He stopped in front of his secretary. \u0027 Mr. Stanford telephoned, didn\u0027t he give any indication of what he wanted to see me about so urgently?\", sir. He just said he wanted you to be at his house at nine o\u0027clock Monday morning, and to bring his will and a notary.\" you.

A Harvard Law School graduate in his forties, he was tall and lean, with blond hair, amusedly inquisitive blue eyes, and an easy, graceful 44 He was the troubleshooter for the firm, and Fitzgerald\u0027s choice to take over one day.

Sit down, Steve. We have a problem.\u0027 Steve sighed. \u0027 else is new?\"\u0027s about Harry Stanford.\u0027 Harry Stanford was one of their most prestigious clients. Half a dozen other law firms handled various Stanford Enterprises subsidiaries, but Renquist, Renquist \u0026 Fitzgerald handled his personal affairs. Except for Fitzgerald, none of the members of the firm had ever met him, but he was a legend around the office. \"What\u0027s Stanford done now?\u0027 Steve asked. \u0027\u0027s gotten himself dead.\" Steve looked at him, shocked. \u0027\u0027s whatt \u0027 just received a fax from the. French police in Corsica. Apparently Stanford fell off his yacht and drowned yesterday.\" God!\" know you\u0027ve never met him, but I\u0027ve represented him for more than thirty years. He was a difficult man.\" Fitzgerald leaned back in his chair, thinking about the past. \u0027 were really two Harry Stanfords - the 45 public one who could coax the birds off the money tree, and the sonofabitch who took pleasurelin destroying people. He was a charmer, but he could turn on you like a cobra. He had a split personality - he was both the snake charmer and the snake.\" fascinating.\" was about thirty years ago - thirty-one, to be exact - when I joined this law firm. Old Man Renquist handled Stanford then. You know how people use the phrase \"larger than life\"? Well, Harry Stanford was really larger than life. If he didn\u0027t, exist, you couldn\u0027t have invented him. He was a colossus. He had an Ing energy and ambition. He was a great athlete. He boxed in college and was a ten-goal polo player. But even when he was young, Harry Stanford was impossible. He was the only man I\u0027ve ever known who wag totally without compassion. He was sadistic and vindictive, and he had the instincts of a vulture. He loved forcing his competitors into bankruptcy. It was rumored that there was more than one suicide because of him.\" sounds like a monster.\" the one hand, yes. On the other hand, he founded an orphanage in New Guinea and a hospital in Bombay, and he gave millions to charity - anonymously. No one ever knew what to expect next.\" did he become so wealthyt \u0027\u0027s your Greek mythologyt \u0027\u0027m a -little rusty.\u0027 46 of Oedipust \u0027 know the story Steve nodded. \u0027 killed his father to get his mother.\". Well, that was Harry Stanford. Only he killed his father to get his mother\u0027s vote.\u0027 Steve was staring at him. \u0027 Fitzgerald leaned forward. \u0027 the early thirties, E\"\"Harry\u0027s father had a grocery store here in Boston. It did so well that he opened a second one, and pretty soon he had a small chain of grocery stores. When H411M finished college, his father brought him into the business as a partner and put him on the board of directors. As I said, Harry was ambitious. He had big reams Instead of buying meat from packing houses, he wanted the chain to raise its own livestock. He wanted it to buy land, and grow its own vegetables, can its own goods. His father disagreed, and they fought a lot. \u0027 Harry had his biggest brainstorm of all. He told his father he wanted the company to build a chain of supermarkets that sold everything from automobiles to furniture to life insurance, at a discount, and charge customers a membership fee. Harry\u0027s father thought he was crazy, and he turned down the idea. But Harry didn\u0027t intend to let anything get in his way. He decided he had to get rid of the old man. He persuaded his father to take a long vacation, and while he was away, Harry went to work charming the board of directors. \u0027 was a brilliant salesman and he sold them on 47 his,-concept. He persuaded his aunt and uncle, who were on the board, to vote for him. He romanced the other members of the board. He took them to lunch, went fox hunting with one, golfing with another. He slept with a board membees wife who had influence over her husband. But it was his mother who held the largest block of stock and had the final vote. Harry persuaded her to give it to him and to vote against her husband.\u0027, \"Mat\u0027s unbelievable!\" Harry\u0027s father returned, he learned that his family had voted him out of the company.\u0027 GMy God! s \u0027\u0027s more. Harry wasn\u0027t satisfied with that. When his father tried to get into his own office, he found that he was barred from the building. And, remember, Harry was only in his thirties then. His nickname around the company was the Iceman. But credit where credit is due, Steve. He single-handedly built. Stanford Enterprises into one of the biggest privately held conglomerates in the world. He expanded the company to include timber, chemicals, communications, electronics, and a staggering amount of real estate. And he wound up with. all the stock.\" must have been an incredible man,\u0027 Steve said. \"He was. To men - and to wornen.\" he marriedt Simon Fitzgerald sat there for a long time, remembering. When he finally spoke he said, \"Harry Stanford 48 married to one of the most beautiful women I\u0027ve ,\u0027,,4ver seen. Emily Temple. They had three children, two boys and a girl. Emily came from a very social family \"\"In Hobe Sound, Florida. She adored Harry, and she to close her eyes to his cheating, but one day it C. tot to be too much for her. She had a governess for 4he children, a woman named Rosemary Nelson. Young and attractive. What made her even more 4ttractive to Harry Stanford was the fact that she refused to go to bed with him. It drove him crazy. He wasn\u0027t used to rejection. Well, when Harry Stanford turned on the charm, he was irresistible. He finally got Rosemary into bed. He got her pregnant, and she went to see a doctor. Unfortunately, the doctor\u0027s son-in-law @was a columnist, and he got hold of the story and printed it. There was one hell of a scandal. You know Boston. It, was all over the newspapers. I still have clippings about it somewhere.\" she get an abortiont Fitzgerald shook his head. \u0027. Harry wanted her to have one, but she refused. They had a terrible scene. He told her he loved her and wanted to marry her. Of course, he had told that to dozens ofwomen. But Emily overheard their conversation, and in the middle of that same night she committed suicide.\"\u0027s awful. What happened to the governess?\" Nelson disappeared. We know that she had a daughter she named Julia, at St. Joseph\u0027s Hospital in Milwaukee. She sent a note to Stanford, but, I 49 don\u0027t believe he even bothered to reply. By then, he was involved with someone new. He wasn\u0027t interested in Rosemary anymore.\" ... \" \"The real tragedy is what happened later. The children rightfully blamed their father for their mother\u0027s suicide. They were ten, twelve, and fourteen at the time. Old enough to feel the pain, but too young to fight their father. They hated him. And Harry\u0027s greatest fear was that one day they would do to him what he had done to his own father. So he did everything he could to make sure that never happened. He sent them away to different boarding schools and summer camps, and arranged for his children to see as little of one another as possible. They received no money from him. They lived on the small trust that their mother had left them. All their lives he used the carrot-and stick approach with them. He held out his fortune as the caffot, then withdrew it if they displeased him.\"\u0027s happened to the children?\" is a judge in the circuit court in Chicago. Woodrow doesn\u0027t do anything.

The office was crowded, filled with reporters from television and news services from all over the globe. Everyone seemed to be speaking at the same time. \u0027, why was he out in a storm when ... ?\" could he fall off a yacht in the middle of ...

If I handle this properly, it will mean a big promotion and - The sergeant interrupted his thoughts. \u0027.\u0027 52 ,,He whispered in Durer\u0027s ear and handed him Steve Sloane\u0027s card. Capitaine Durer studied it and frowned. \u0027 can\u0027t see him now,\u0027 he snapped. \u0027 him to come back tomorrow at ten o\u0027clock.\", sir.\" Capitaine Durer watched thoughtfully as the sergeant left the room. He had no intention of -letting anyone take away his moment of glory. He turned back to the reporters and smiled. \u0027, what were you asking ... T I In the outer office, the sergeant was saying to Sloane, \u0027 am sorry, but Capitaine Durer is very busy immediately. He would like you to expose yourself here tomorrow morning at ten o\u0027clock. Steve Sloane looked at him in dismay. \u0027 morning? That\u0027s ridiculous - I don\u0027t want to-wait that long.\u0027 The sergeant shrugged. \u0027 is of your chosen, monsieur.\u0027 Steve frowned. \u0027 well. I don\u0027t have a hotel reservation.

In Durer\u0027s office, the capitaine was happily coping with the barrage of reporters\u0027 questions. 53 A television reporter asked, \u0027 can you be sure it was an accidentt , Durer looked into the lens of the camera. \u0027, there was an eyewitness to this terrible event. Monsieur Stanford\u0027s cabin has an open veranda. Apparently some important papers flew out of his hand, onto the terrace, and he ran to retrieve them. When he reached out, he lost his balance and fell into the water. His bodyguard saw it happen and immediately called for help. The ship stopped, and they were able to retrieve the body.\" did the autopsy showt \u0027 is a small island, gentlemen. We are not properly equipped to do a full autopsy. However, our medical examiner reports that the cause of death was drowning. We found seawater in his lungs.

One of the photographers said, \u0027 you mind if we take a picture of you, capitainet Capitaine Durer hesitated for a dramatic moment. \u0027. Please, gentlemen, do what you must.\u0027 And the cameras began to flash. He had lunch at La Fontana on Rue NOtre Dame, and with the rest of the day to kill, started exploring the town. 54 -Ajaccio was a colorful Mediterranean town that still basked in the glory of having been Napoleon Bonaparte\u0027s birthplace. I think Harry Stanford would have -identfied with this place, Steve thought. it was the tourist season in Corsica, and the streets were crowded with visitors chatting away in French, Italian, German and Japanese. That evening Steve had an Italiaii\u0027dinner at Le Boccaccio and returned to his hotel. \u0027 messagest he asked the room clerk, optimistically. \u0027, monsieur.\u0027 He lay in bed haunted by what Simon Fitzgerald had told him about Harry Stanford. Did she get an abortion? No. Harry wanted her to have one, but sherefused They had a terrible scene. He told her he loved her and wanted to marry her. Of course, he had told that to dozens of women. But Emily overheard their conversation, and in the middfe of that same night she commit- ted suicide. Steve wondered how she had done it. He finally fell asleep. At ten o\u0027clock the following morning, Steve Sloane appeared again at the Pr6fecture. The same sergeant was seated behind the desk. \u0027 morning,\u0027 Steve said. 55 \u0027, monsieur. Can I help to assist yout Steve handed the sergeant another business card. \u0027\u0027m here to see Capitaine Durer.\" moment.\u0027 The sergeant got up, walked into the inner office, and closed the door behind him. Capitaine Durer, dressed in an impressive new uniform, was being interviewed by an RAI television crew from Italy. He was looking into the camera. \u0027 I took charge of the case, the first thing I did was to make certain that there was no foul play involved in Monsieur Stanford\u0027s death.\u0027 The interviewer asked, \u0027 you were satisfied that there was none, capitainet \"Completely satisfied. There is no question but that it was an unfortunate accident.\u0027 The director said, \u0027. Let us cut to another angle and a closer shot.\u0027 The sergeant took the opportunity to hand Capitaine Durer Sloane\u0027s business card. \u0027 is outside.\" is the matter with yout Durer growled. \u0027\u0027t you see I\u0027m busy? Have him come back tomorrow.\u0027 He had just received word that there were a dozen more reporters on their way, some from as far away as Russia and South Africa. \u0027.\".\" you ready, capitaine?\u0027 the director asked. Capitaine Durer smiled. \u0027\u0027m ready.\u0027 The sergeant returned to the outer office. \u0027 am sorry, monsieur. Capitaine Durer is out of business today.\u0027 56 \u0027 am I,\u0027 Steve snapped. \u0027 him that all he has to do is sign a paper authorizing the release of Mr. Stanford\u0027s body, and I\u0027ll be on my way. That\u0027s not too much to ask, is itt - \u0027 am afraid, yes. The capitaine has many responsibilities, and \u0027\u0027t someone else give me the authorizationt \u0027, no, monsieur. Only the capitaine can do the authority-, ISteve Sloane stood there, seething. \u0027 can I see himt \u0027 suggest if you try again tomorrow morning. The phrase \u0027 again\u0027 grated on Steve\u0027s ears. \u0027\u0027ll do that,\u0027he said. \u0027 the way, I understand there was an eyewitness to the accident - Mr. Stanford\u0027s bodyguard, a Dmitri Kaminsky.\".

Could you tell me where he\u0027s staying. \u0027.\" that a hoteff \u0027, monsieur.\u0027 There was pity in his voice. \u0027 is a country., Steve\u0027s voice rose an octave. \"Are you telling me that the only witness to Stanford\u0027s death was allowed by the police to leave here before anyone could interrogate himt \u0027 Drurer interrogated him.\u0027 Steve took a deep breath. \"Thank you.\u0027 57 \"No problems, monsieur.\u0027 [email protected] Steve returned to his hotel, he reported back to Simon Fitzgerald. \u0027 looks like I\u0027m going to have to stay another night here.9 \u0027\u0027s going on, Stevet \"The man in charge seems to be very busy. It\u0027s the tourist season. He\u0027s probably looking for some lost purses. I should be out of here by tomorrow.\" \"Stay in touch.\u0027 In spite of his irritation, Steve found the island of Corsica enchanting. It had almost a thousand miles of coastline, with soaring, granite mountains that stayed snow-topped until July. The island had been ruled by the Italians until France took it over, and the combination of the two cultures was fascinating. During his dinner at the Cr8perie U San Carlu, he remembered how Simon Fitzgerald had described Harry Stanford. He was the only man I\u0027ve ever known who was totally without compassion ... a sadistic and vindictive man. Well, Harry Stanford is causing a hell of a lot of trouble even in death, Steve thought. On the way to his hotel, Steve stopped at a news- stand to pick up a copy of the International Herald Tribune. The headline read: WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE STANFORD EMPIRE? He paid for the newspaper, and as he turned to leave, his eye was caught by the headlines 58 [email protected] some of the foreign papers on the Stand. He picked them up and looked through them, stunned. Every tories about the single newspaper had front-page s death of Harry Stanford, and in each one of them, his photocapitaine Durer was prominently featured aravh beaming from the pages. So that\u0027s what\u0027s keeping him so busy! We\u0027ll see about that. At nine forty-five the followini\u0027 morning, Steve returned to Capitaine Durer\u0027s reception office. The sergeant was not at his desk, and the door to the inner office was ajar. Steve pushed it open and stepped inside. The capitaine was changing into a new uniform, preparing for his morning press interviews. He looked up as Steve enteread. \"Quest-ce que vous jaites ici? Cest un bureau privo Allez-vous-en!\"\u0027m with the New York Times\" Steve Sloane said. Instantly, Durer brightened. \"Ali, come in, come in. You said your name is ... T \u0027. John Jones.\" \"Can I offer you something, perhaps? Coffee? Cognac?\", thanks\" Steve said. \u0027, please, sit down.\u0027 Durer\u0027s voice became somber. \"You are here, of course, about the terrible tragedy that has happened on our little island. Poor Monsieur Stanford.\u0027 59 \u0027 do you plan to release the body9\u0027Steve asked. Capitaine Durer sighed. \u0027, I am afraid not for many, many days. There are a great number of forms to fill out in the case of a man as important as Monsieur Stanford. There are protocols to be followed, you understand.\" think I do,\u0027 Steve said. \"Perhaps ten days. Perhaps, two weeks.\u0027 By then the interest of the press will have cooled down. \u0027\u0027s my card,\u0027 Steve said. He handed Capitaine Durer a card. The capitaine glanced at it, then took a closer look. \u0027 are an attorney. You are not a reportert \u0027. I\u0027m Harry Stanford\u0027s attorney.\u0027 Steve Sloane rose. \u0027 want your authorization to release his body.\", I wish I could give it to you,\u0027 Capitaine Durer said, regretfully. \u0027,.my hands are tied. I do not see how \"Tomorrow.\" is impossible! There is no way ...\" suggest that you get in touch with your superiors in Paris. Stanford Enterprises has several very large factories in France. It would be a shame if our board of directors decided to close all of them down and build in other countries.\u0027 Capitaine Durer was staring at him. \u0027 ... I have no control over such matters, monsieur.\" I do,\u0027 Steve assured him. \u0027 will see that Mr. 60 Stanford, s body is released to me tomorrow, or you\u0027re going to find yourself in more trouble than you can possibly imagine.\" Steve turned to leave. \u0027!
