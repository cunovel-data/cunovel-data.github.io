Family - that\u0027s what it\u0027s all about. Without family values, this country would be up the creek even worse than it is. All these young kids are living together without being married, -and having babies. It\u0027s shocking. No wonder there\u0027s so much crime. If Dan Quayle ever runs for president, he\u0027s sure got my vote.\u0027 It was a shame, he thought, that he couldn\u0027t vote because of a stupid law, but, regardless, he was behind Quayle all the way.. He had four children: Billy, eight, and the girls - Amy, Clarissa, and Susan, ten, twelve, and fourteen.\\n\\n They were wonderful children, and his greatestjoy was spending what he liked to call quality time with them. His weekends were totally devoted.\\n\\n to the children. He barbecued for them, played with them, took them to movies and ball games, and helped them with their homework. All the youngsters in the neighborhood adored him. He repaired their bikes and toys, and 31 invited them on picnics with his family. They gave him the nickname of Papa. On a sunny Saturday morning, he was seated in the bleachers, watching the baseball game. it was a picture-perfect day, with warm sunshine and fluffy cumulus clouds dappling the sky. His eight-year-old son, Billy, was at bat, looking very professional and grown up in his Little League uniform. Papa\u0027s three girls and his wife were at his side. It doesn\u0027t get any better than this, he thought happily. Why can\u0027t all fwnifies be like ours? It was the bottom of the eighth inning, the score was tied, with two outs and the bases loaded.\\n\\n Billy was at the plate, three balls and two strikes against him. Papa called out, encouragingly,\u0027Get\u0027em, Billy! Over the fence!\u0027 Billy waited for the pitch. It was fast and low, and Billy swung wildly and missed.\\n\\n The umpire yelled, \u0027 threel\u0027 The inning was over. \u0027 were groans and cheers from the crowd of parents and family friends. Billy stood there disheartened, watching the teams change sides. Papa called out, \u0027\u0027s all right, son. You\u0027ll do it next time!\u0027 Billy tried to force a smile. John Cotton, the team manager, was waiting for Billy. \u0027\u0027re outta the game!\u0027 he said. 32 ut, Mrcotton ...\u0027 @Go on. Get off the field.\u0027 Billy\u0027s father watched in hurt amazement as his son the field.\\n\\n He can\u0027t do that, he thought.

I was planning a nice barbecue for us tomorrow., His wife took his hand and said lovingly, \u0027\u0027t worry about it. Your work is more important.\u0027 Not as important as my family, he thought stubbornly. Dan Quayle would understand His hand began to itch fiercely and he \u003datched it. Why does it do that? he wondered. r1l have to see a dermatologist one of these days. John Cotton was the assistant manager at the local supermarket. A burly man in his fiffies, he had agreed 33 to manage the Little League team because his son was a ballplayer. His.\\n\\n team had lost that afternoon because of young Billy. The supermarket had closed, and John Cotton was in the parking lot, walking toward his car, when a stranger approached him, carrying a package. \u0027 me, Mr. Cotton.\"?\" wonder if I could talk to you for a moment?\u0027 `1The store is closed.\", it\u0027s not that.

He said pleadingly, \"This is the bat that Billy used. You can see that it\u0027s chipped, so it isn\u0027t fair to punish him because -\", mister, I don\u0027t give a damn about the bat. Your son is out!\u0027 Billy\u0027s father sighed unhappily.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sure you won\u0027t change your -mind?\u0027 34 \u0027 chance.\u0027 As Cotton reached for the door handle of his car, Billy\u0027s father swung the bat against the rear window, gmashing it.

He had just enough time to catch the next flight to Boston. His hand @6egan to itch again. At seven o\u0027clock Sunday morning, dressed in a vested sint and carrying an expensive leather briefcase, he walked past Vendome, through Copley Square, and on to Stuart Street. A half block past the Park Plaza Castle, he entered the Boston Trust Building and approached the guard. With dozens of tenants in the 35 huge building, them would be no way the guard at the rcception desk could identify him. Good morning,\u0027 the man said. \u0027 morning, sir. May I help yout He sighed. \u0027 God can\u0027t help me.

The office he was looking for was on the fifth floor. He took the elevator to the sixth floor, walked down a flight, and moved down the corridor. The legend on the door read, RENQuist, RENQuis-r \u0026 Fffz- GMALD, ATMRNEYS AT LAw. He looked around to make certain the corridor was deserted, then opened his briefcase and took out a small pick and a tension tool. It took him five seconds to open the locked door. He stepped inside and closed the door behind him.\\n\\n The reception room was furnished in old-fashioned, conservative taste, as befitted one of Boston\u0027s top law firms. The man stood there a moment, orienting himself, then moved toward the back, to a filing room where records were kept. Inside the room was a bank of steel cabinets with alphabetical labels on the front. He tried the cabinet marked R-S. It was locked. From his briefcase, he removed a blank key, a file, and a pair of pliers. He pushed the blank key inside 36 sma cabinet lock, gently turning it from side to side. After a moment, he withdrew it and examined @\u0027:jbe black markings on it. Holding the key with the pliers, he carefully filed off the black spots. put the key into the lock again, and repeated the ure. He was humming quietly to himself as he the lock, and he smiled as he suddenly realized he was humming: \u0027 Away.\\n\\n Places\u0027. I\u0027ll take \",;fty family on vacation, he thought happily. A real I\u0027ll bet the kidy w6uld love Hawaii. \u0027 cabinet drawer came open, and he pulled it toward him. It took only a moment to find the folder he wanted. He removed a small, Pentax camera from @;,his briefcase and went to work. Ten minutes later he was finished. He took several pieces of Kleenex from the briefcase, walked over to the water cooler, and wet them. He returned to the filing room and wiped up the steel shavings on the floor. He locked the file cabinet, made his way out to the corridor, locked. the front door to the offices, and left the building. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/morning-noon-and-night/page-4.html","bookId":2366,"book":{"id":2366,"title":"Morning, Noon and Night","description":"Storyline: Cruising on his yacht, Harry Stanford, one of the world\u0027s wealthiest men, drowns under mysterious circumstances.
