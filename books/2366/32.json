Let\u0027s pick it up before it sinks something.\u0027 The log turned out to be a body, and even more startling, a body that had been embalmed. The policemen stared down at it and said, \u0027 the hell did an embalmed body get into the Charles Rivert Lieutenant Michael Kennedy was talking- to the coroner. \u0027 you sure of that?\u0027 The coroner replied, \u0027.

They handled it through their attorney, Simon Fitzgerald.\u0027 I think I\u0027ll have a talk with Mr. Fitzgerald.\u0027 When Steve returned to Boston from Chicago, he went directly to Simon Fitzgerald\u0027s office. \u0027 look beat,\" Fitzgerald said. \u0027 beat - beaten. The whole thing is falling apart, Simon. We had three possible leads: Dmitri Kaminsky, Frank Timmons, and Margo Posner. Well, Kaminsky is dead, it\u0027s the wrong Timmons, and Margo Posner is locked away in an asylum. We have nothing to The voice of Fitzgerald\u0027s secretary came over the intercom. \u0027 me.

When Fitzgerald, was finished, Kennedy said, \u0027 have no idea who it was that posed as this investigator, Timmons. \u0027. I talked to Timmons. He has no idea, either.\u0027 Kennedy sighed. \u0027 gets curiouser and curiouser.\" is Harry Stanford\u0027s body nowt Steve asked. \u0027\u0027re keeping him at the morgue for the present. I hope he doesn\u0027t disappear again.\u0027 11 do, too,\u0027 Steve said.\n \"We\u0027ll have Perry Winger run DNA test on Julia.\u0027 When Steve called Tyler to tell him that his father\u0027s body had been found, Tyler was genuinely shocked. \u0027\u0027s terrible!\u0027 he said. \u0027 could have done a thing like thatt \u0027\u0027s what we\u0027re trying to find out,\u0027 Steve told him. Tyler was furious. That incompetent idiot, Baker! He\u0027s going to pay for this. I have to get this settled before it gets out of hand \u0027. Fitzgerald, as you may be aware, I\u0027ve been appointed chief judge of Cook County. I have a very heavy caseload, and they\u0027re pressuring me to return. I can\u0027t delay much longer. I\u0027d appreciate it if you could do. something to get the probate finished quickly.\" put in a call this morning,\u0027 Steve told him. It should be closed within the next three days.\" will be fine. Keep me informed, please.\"\u0027ll do that, judge.\u0027 Steve sat in his office reviewing the events of the past few weeks. He recalled the conversation he had had with Chief Inspector Mcphearson. I Wejound his body a little while ago. Hisfingers had been chopped off and he had been shot several tines.\u0027 But wait, Steve thought. There\u0027s something he didn\u0027t tell me. He picked up the telephone and put in another call to Australia. The voice on the other end of the telephone said, \u0027 is Chief Inspector Mcphearson.\u0027 gym, inspector. This is Steve Sloane. I forgot to ask you a question. When you found Dmitri Kaminsky\u0027s body, were there any papers on him?... I see ... that\u0027s fine. Thank you very much.\u0027 When Steve hung up the phone, his secretary\u0027s voice came over the intercom. \u0027 Kennedy holding on line two.\u0027 Steve punched the phone buttion. \u0027. Sorry to keep you waiting. I was on an overseas call.\" NYPD gave me some interesting information on Hoop Malkovich. He seems to be quite a slippery character.\u0027 Steve picked up a pen. \u0027 ahead.\" police believe that the bakery he works for is a front for a drug ring.\u0027 The lieutenant paused, then continued.\n \"Malkovich is probably a drug pusher. But he\u0027s clever. They haven\u0027t been able to nail him yet.\" else?\u0027 Steve asked. \u0027 police believe the operatio , is tied into the French mafia with a connection thr, ugh Marseilles. If I learn anything else, I\u0027ll call.\", Lieutenant. That\u0027s very helpful.\u0027 Steve put down the phone and headed out the office door. When Steve arrived home, filled with anticipation, he called, \u0027?\u0027 There was no answer. He began to panic. \u0027!\" She\u0027s been kidnapped or killed, he thought, and he felt a sudden sense of alarm. Julia appeared at the top of the stairs. \u0027?\u0027 He took a deep breath. \u0027 thought ...\u0027 He was pale. \u0027 you all right?\u0027 6yes.1 She came down the stairs. \u0027 things go well\u0027in Chicago?\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027\u0027m afraid not.\u0027 He told her what had happened. \u0027\u0027re going to have a reading of the will on Thursday, Julia. That\u0027s only three days from now. Whoever is behind this has to get rid of you by then or his - or her - plan can\u0027t work.\u0027 She swallowed. \u0027 see. Do you have any idea who it is?, \u0027 a matter of fact ...\u0027The telephone rang. \u0027 me.\n 9Steve picked up the telephone. \u0027?\" is Dr. Tichner in Florida.\n Sorry I didn\u0027t call earlier, but I\u0027ve been away.\u0027 \u0027.

I\u0027m not asking this out of curiosity. It\u0027s very important .\n ..\"\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t .. \u0027 did have him admitted to the Harbor Group Clinic in Jupiter, didn\u0027t yout There was a long hesitation. \u0027.\n That\u0027s a matter of record.\" you, doctor. That\u0027s all I needed to know.\u0027 Steve replaced the receiver \u0027 stood there a moment. \u0027\u0027s unbelievable!\" Julia asked. \u0027 down.\u0027 Thirty minutes later, Steve was in his car headed for Rose Hill. All the pieces had finally fallen into place. He\u0027s brilliant. It almost worked. It could still work if anything happened to Julia, Steve thought. At Rose Hill, Clark answered the door. \u0027 evening, Mr. Sloane.\" evening, Clark. Is Judge Stanford int \u0027\u0027s in the library. I\u0027ll tell him you\u0027re here.\"\n \"Thank you.\u0027 He watched Clark walk off. A minute later, the butler returned. \u0027 Stanford will see you now.\" you.\u0027 Steve walked into the library. Tyler was sitting in front of a chess board, concentrating. He looked up as Steve walked in. \u0027 wanted to see met \"Yes. I believe the young woman who came to see you several days ago is the real Julia. The other Julia was a fake.\" that\u0027s not possible.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s true, and I\u0027ve found out who\u0027s behind all this.\u0027 There was a momentary silence. Then Tyler said slowly, \u0027 havet \u0027. I\u0027m afraid this is going to shock you. it\u0027s your brother, Woody., Tyler was looking up at Steve in amazement. Are you saying that Woody is responsible for what\u0027s been happening?\"\u0027s right.\" ... I can\u0027t believe it.\u0027. \u0027 could 1, but it all checks out. I talked to his doctor in Hobe Sound. Did you know your brother is on drugst \u0027 ... I\u0027ve suspected it., \u0027 are expensive. Woody isn\u0027t working. He needs money, and he was obviously looking for a bigger share of the estate. He\u0027s the one who hired the fake Julia, but when you came to us and asked for a DNA test, he panicked and had your father\u0027s body removed from the coffin because he couldn\u0027t afford to have that test made.\n That\u0027s what tipped me off. And I suspect that he sent someone to Kansas City to have the real Julia killed. Did you know that Peggy has a brother who\u0027s tied into the mob? As long as Julia\u0027s alive and there are two Julias around, his plan can1t work.\" you sure of all thist \"Absolutely. There\u0027s something\u0027else, judge.\u0027 4Yest \u0027 don\u0027t think your father fell off his yacht. I believe that Woody had your father murdered. Peggy\u0027s brother could have arranged that too. I\u0027m told he has connections with the Marseilles mafia. They could easily have paid a crew member to do it. I\u0027m flying to Italy tonight to have a talk with the captain of the yacht.\u0027 Tyler was listening intently. When he spoke, he said approvingly, \u0027\u0027s a good idea.\u0027 Captain Vacarro knows nothing. \u0027\u0027ll try to be back by Thursday for the reading of the will.\" - Tyler said, \u0027 about the real Julia? ...
