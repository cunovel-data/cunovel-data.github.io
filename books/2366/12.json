{"id":68996,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"It was the gathering of a clan of strangers. It had been years since they had seen or communicated with one another. Judge Tyler Stanford arrived in Boston by plaiie Kendall Stanford Renaud flew in from Paris. Marc Renaud took the tram from New York. Woody Stanford and Peggy drove up from Hobe Sound. The heirs had been notilied that the funeral services would take place at King\u0027s Chapel. The street outside the church was barricaded, and there were policemen to hold back the crowd that had gathered to watch - the dignitaries arrive. The vice president of the United States was there, as well as senators and ambassadors and statesmen from as far away as Turkey and Saudi Arabia. During his lifetime, Harry Stanford had cast a large shadow, and all seven hundred seats in the chapel would be occupied. 128 \u0027.Tyler and Woody and Kendall, with their spouses, met inside the vestry. It was an awkward meeting. They were alien to one another, and the only thing they had . common was the body of the man in the hearse outside the church. \u0027 is my husband, Marc,\u0027 Kendall said. \u0027 is my wife, Peggy. Peggy, my sister, Kendall, . my brother, Tyler.\u0027 There were polite exchanges of hellos. They stood there, uncomfortably studying one another, until an usher came up to the group. \u0027 me,\u0027 he said in a hushed voice. \u0027 services are about to begin. Would you follow me, please?\u0027 He led them to a reserved pew at the front of the chapel- They took their seats and waited, each preoccupied with his or her own thoughts. I To Tyler, it felt strange to be back in Boston. The only good memories he had of it were when his mother and Rosemary were alive. When he was eleven, Tyler had seen a print of the famous Goya painting Saturn Devouring His Son, and he had always identified it with his father. And now, Tyler, looking over at his father\u0027s coffin as it was carried into the church by the pallbearers, thought, Saturn is dead. V know your dirty little secret.\u0027 The minister stepped into the chapel\u0027s historic wineglass shaped pulpit. - 129 \"\u0027Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.\"\u0027 Woody was feeling exhilarated. He had taken a hit of heroin before coming to the church, and it had not worn off yet. He glanced over at his brother and sister. Tyler has put on weight. He looks like a judge. Kendall has turned into a beauty, but she seems to be under a strain. I wonder if it\u0027s because Father died? No. She hatedhim as much as Idid. He looked at his wife, seated next to him. Im sorry I didn\u0027t get to show her off to the old man. He would have died of a heart attack. The minister was speaking. \"\u0027Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.\"\u0027 Kendall was not listening to the service. She was thinking about the red dress. Her father had telephoned her in New York one afternoon. \"So you\u0027ve become a big-shot designer, have you? Well, let\u0027s see how good you are. I\u0027m taking my new gir#\u0027riend to a charity ball Saturday night. She\u0027s your size. I want you to design a dress for her.\" \"Saturday? I can\u0027t, Father. I.. \u0027\u0027ll do it.\u0027 130 @And she had designed the ugliest dress she could conceive of. It had a large black bow in front and yards of ribbons and lace. It was a monstrosity. She had sent it to her father, and he had telephoned her again. \u0027 got the dress. By the way, my giry\u0027riend can\u0027t make it Saturday, so you\u0027re going to be my date, and you\u0027re going to wear that dress.\" And then the terrible phrase: \u0027 don\u0027t want to dbgppoint me, do yotc?\u0027 I And she had gone, not daring to change the dress, and had spent the most humiliating evening of her life. 4,For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away;blessed be the name of the Lord!\"\u0027 Peggy Stanford was uncomfortable. She was awed by the splendor of the huge church and the elegantlooking people in it. She had never been to Boston before, and to her it meant the world of Stanfords, with all its pomp and glory. These people were so much better than she was. She took her husband\u0027s hand. \"\u0027All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field ... The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.\" 131 Marc was thinking about the blackmail letter that his wife had received. It had been worded very carefully, very cleverly. It would be impossible to find out who was behind it. He looked at Kendall, seated next to him, pale and tense. How much more can she take? he wondered. He moved closer to her. \"\u0027Unto God\u0027s gracious mercy and protection we commit you. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you. The Lord lift up the light of his countenance upon you and give you peace, now and forever. Amen.\"\u0027 With the service finished, the minister announced, The burial services will be private - family members only.* Tyler looked at the coffin and thought about the body inside. Last night, before the casket was secured, he had gone straight from Boston\u0027s Logan International Airport to the viewing at the funeral home. He wanted to see his father dead. Woody watched as the coffin was carried out of the church past the staring mourners, and he. smiled: Give the peopk what they want. The graveside ceremony at the old Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge was brief. The family watched Harry Stanford\u0027s body being lowered to its final resting place, and as the dirt was being thrown onto the casket 132 the minister said, \"There\u0027s no need for you to stay any longer if you don\u0027t wish to.\u0027 Woody nodded. \u0027.\u0027 The effect of the heroin was beginning to wear off, and he was starting to feel -Jittery. \u0027\u0027s get the hell out of here.\u0027 Marc said, \u0027 are we going?\u0027 Tyler turned to the group. \u0027\u0027re staying at Rose Hill. It\u0027s all been arranged.,We\u0027ll stay there until the estate is settled.\" few minutes later, they were in limousines on their way to the house. Boston had a strict social hierarchy. The nouveaux riches lived on Commonwealth Avenue, and the social climbers on Newbury Street. Less affluent old families lived on Marlborough Street. Back Bay was the city\u0027s newest and most prestigious address, but Beacon Hill was still the citadel for Boston\u0027s oldest and wealthiest families. It was a rich mixture. of Victorian townhouses and brownstones, old churches and chid shopping areas. Rose Hill, the Stanford estate, was a beautiful old Victorian house that stood amid three acres of land on Beacon Hill. The house that the Stanford children had grown-up in was filled with unpleasant memories. When the limousines arrived in front of the house, the passengers got out and stared up at the old mansion. \u0027 can\u0027t believe Father isn\u0027t going to be inside, waiting for us,\u0027 Kendall said. 133 Woody grinned. \u0027\u0027s too busy trying to run things In hell.\u0027 Tyler took a deep breath. \u0027\u0027s go.\u0027 As they approached the front door it opened, and Clark, the butler, stood there. He was in his seventies, a dignified, capable servant who had \u0027 at Rose Hill for more than thirty years. He had watched the children grow up, and had lived through all the scandals. Clark\u0027s face lit up as he saw the group. \u0027 afternoon!\u0027 Kendall gave him a warm hug. \u0027, ifs so good to see you again-\" been a long time, Miss. Kendall.\"\u0027s Mrs. Renaud now. This is my husband, Marc.\" do you do, sir?\u0027 \"My wife has told me a great deal about you.\" too terrible I hope,\u0027sir.\u0027 , the contrary. She has only fond memories of YOU. \u0027 you, sir.1 Clark turned to Tyler. \u0027 afternoon, Judge Stanford.\", Clark.\u0027 . \u0027\u0027s a pleasure to see you, sir.\" you. You\u0027re -looking very well.\" are you, sir. I\u0027m so sorry about what has happened.\" you. Are you set up here to take care of all of us?\u0027 134 Goh, yes. I think we can make everyone comfortable. \u0027 I in my old room?\u0027 Clark smiled. \u0027 right.\u0027 He turned to Woody. 411m pleased to see you, Mr. Woodrow. I want to -\u0027 Woody grabbed Peggy\u0027s arm. \u0027 on,\u0027 he said curtly. \u0027 want to get freshened up.\u0027 The others watched as Woody pushed past them \u0027 took Peggy upstairs. The rest of the group walked into the huge drawing room. The room was dominated by a pair of massive Louis XIV armoires. Scattered around the room were a giltwood console table with a molded marble top, and an array of exquisite period chairs and couches. An olu chandelier hung from the high ceiling. On the walls were dark medieval paintings. Clark turned to Tyler. \u0027 Stanford, I have a message for you. Mr. Simon Fitzgerald would like you to telephone him to tell him when it would be convenient to arrange a meeting with the family.\" is Simon Fitzgeraldt Marc asked. Kendall replied. \u0027\u0027s the family attorney. Father has been with him forever but we\u0027ve never met him.\" presume he wants to discuss the disposition of the estate,\u0027 Tyler said. He turned to the others. \u0027 it\u0027s all right with all of you, I\u0027ll. arrange for him to meet us here tomorrow morning.\" w;ll be fine,\u0027 Kendall said. 135 \u0027 chef is preparing dinner,\u0027Clark told them.\u0027Will eight o\u0027clock be satisfactory?\",\u0027 Tyler said. \u0027 you.\" and Millie will show you to your rooms.\u0027 Tyler turned to his sister and her husband. \u0027\u0027ll meet down here at eight, shall we?\u0027 As Woody and Peggy entered their bedroom upstairs, Peggy asked, \u0027 you all right?\"\u0027m fine,\u0027 Woody snapped. \u0027 me alone.\u0027 She watched him go into the bathroom and slam the door shut. She stood there, waiting. Ten minutes later, Woody came out. He was smiling. \u0027, baby.\".\" \"Well, how do you like the old house?\"\u0027s ... it\u0027s enormous.\"\u0027s a monstrosity.\u0027 He walked over to the bed and put his arms around Peggy. \"This is my old room. These walls were covered with sports posters - the Bruins, the Celtics, the Red Sox. I wanted to be an athlete. I had big dreams. In my senior year in boarding school, I was captain of the football team. I got offers of admission from half a dozen college coaches.\" one did you take?\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027 of them. My father said they were only interested in the Stanford name, that they just wanted money from him. He sent me to an engineering school where they didn\u0027t play football.\u0027 136 He was silent for a moment. Then he mumbled, \u0027 could\u0027a been a contenda .. She looked at him puzzled. \"Whaff He looked up. \u0027\u0027t you ever see On the Waterfront?\u0027 6NO. t \u0027 was a line that Marlon Brando said. It means we both got screwed.\" father must have been touih.\u0027 Woody gave a short, derisive laugh. \"That\u0027s the nicest thing anyone has ever said about him. I remember when I was just a kid, I fell off a horse. I wanted to get back on and ride again. My father wouldn\u0027t let Ine..You\u0027ll never be a rider,\" he said. \"You\u0027re too clumsy.\"\u0027 Woody looked up at her. \u0027\u0027s why I became a nine-goal polo player.\u0027 They came together at the dinner table,,strangers to one another, seated in an uncomfortable silence, their only connection childhood traumas. Kendall looked around the room. Terrible memories mingled with an appreciation for its beauty. The dining table was classical French, an early Louis XV, surrounded by Directoire walnut chairs. In one comer was a blue-and-cream. painted . French provincial comer armoire. On the walls were drawings by Watteau and Fragonard. Kendall turned to Tyler. \u0027 read about your decision in the Rorello case. He deserved what you gave him.\u0027 137 \u0027 must be exciting being a judge,\u0027 Peggy said. \u0027 it is.\" kind of cases do you handlet Marc inquired. \u0027 cases - rapes, drugs, murder.\u0027 Kendall turned pale and started to say something, and Marc grabbed her hand and squeezed it as a warning. Tyler said politely to Kendall, \u0027\u0027ve become a successful designer.\u0027 Kendall was finding it hard to breathe. \u0027.\" fantastic,\u0027 Marc said. \u0027 Marc, what do you do?\"\u0027m with a brokerage house.\", you\u0027re one of those young Wall Street millionaires.\", not exactly, judge. I\u0027m really just getting started.\u0027 Tyler gave Marc a patronizing look. \u0027 guess it\u0027s lucky you have a successful wife.\u0027 Kendall blushed and whispered in Marc\u0027s ear, \u0027 no attention. Remember I love you.\u0027 Woody was beginning\u0027to feel the effect of the drug. He turned to look at his wife. \"Peggy could use some decent clothes,\u0027 he said. \u0027 she doesn\u0027t care how she looks.\u0027Do you, angelt Peggy sat there, embarrassed, not knowing what to say. \u0027 a little waitress costume?\u0027Woody suggested. 138 said, \u0027 me.\u0027 She got up from the table Red upstairs. They were all staring at Woody. He grinned. \u0027\u0027s oversensitive. So, we\u0027re having a discussion about the will tomorrow, eh?\"\u0027s right,\u0027 Tyler said. \"I\u0027ll make you a bet the old man didn\u0027t leave us one dime.\u0027 Marc said, \"But there\u0027s so much money in the A*ate .. Woody snorted. \u0027 didn\u0027t know our father. He probably left us his old jackets and a box of cigars. He liked to use his money to control us. His favorite, line was I I You don\u0027t want to disappoint me, do yotc? \" And we all behaved like good little children because, as you said, there was so much money. Well, I\u0027ll bet the old man found a way to take it with him.\u0027 Tyler said, \"We\u0027ll know tomorrow, won\u0027t we?\u0027 Early the following morning, Simon Fitzgerald and Steve Sloane arrived. Clark escorted them into the library. \u0027\u0027ll inform the family that you\u0027re here,\u0027he said. \u0027 you.\" They watched him leave. The library was huge and opened onto a garden through two large French doors. The room was paneled in dark-stained oak, and the walls were lined with bookcases filled with handsome leather-bound volumes. There was a scattering of comfortable chairs and Italian reading lamps. In one comer stood a 139 customized beveled-glass and ormolu-mounted mahogany cabinet that displayed Harry Stanford\u0027s enviable gun collection. Special drawers had been designed beneath the display case to house the ammunition. \u0027\u0027s going to be an interesting morning,\u0027 Steve said. \u0027 wonder how they\u0027re going to react.\"\u0027ll find out soon enough.\u0027 Kendall and Marc came into the room first. Simon Fitzgerald said,\" Good morning. I\u0027m Simon Fitzgerald. This is my associate, Steve Sloane.\"\u0027m Kendall Renaud, and this is my husband, Marc.\u0027 The men shook hands. Woody and Peggy entered the room. Kendall said, \u0027, this is Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Sloane.\u0027 Woody nodded. \u0027. Did you bring the cash with YOUT \u0027, we really ...\"\u0027m only kidding! This is my wife, Peggy.\u0027 Woody looked at Steve. \u0027 the old man leave me anything or ...

It was Steve who arranged to have your father\u0027s body brought back from Corsica.\u0027 Tyler turned to Steve. \u0027 appreciate that. We\u0027re not 140 what happened exactly. The press has had so many different versions of the story. Was there foul @\u0027.`play involved?\u0027 7. \u0027. It seems to have been an accident.

By the time I arrived in Corsica, he had left.\u0027 Fitzgerald said, \u0027 captain of the yacht had advised your father not to sail into that storm, but for he was in a hurry to return here. He had some reason arranged for a helicopter to bring him back. There was some kind of urgent problem-\u0027 Tyler asked, \u0027 you know what the problem wast back here. \u0027. I cut short my vacation to meet him 1 don\u0027t know what Woody interrupted. \u0027\u0027s all very interesting, but it\u0027s ancient history, isn\u0027t it? Let\u0027s talk about the will. Did he leave us anything or nott His hands were twitching. \u0027 don\u0027t we sit down?\u0027 Tyler suggested. They took chairs. Simon Fitzgerald sat at the desk, 141 facing them. He opened a briefcase and started to take out some papers. Woody was ready to explode. \u0027? For God\u0027s sake, did he or didn\u0027t het Kendall said, Woody ...\" know the answer,\u0027Woody said angrily. \u0027 didn\u0027t leave us a damn cent.\u0027 Fitzgerald looked into the faces of the children of Harry Stanford. \u0027 a matter of fact,\u0027 he said, \u0027 of you will share equally in the estate.\u0027 Steve could feel the sudden euphoria that swept through the room. Woody was staring at Fitzgerald, openniouthed. \u0027? Are you seriousr Hejumped to his feet. \u0027\u0027s fantastic!\u0027 He turned to the others. \u0027 you hear that? The old bastard finally came through!\" He looked at Simon Fitzgerald. \u0027 much money are we talking abouff \u0027 don\u0027t have the exact figure. According to the latest issue of Forbes magazine, Stanford Enterprises is worth six billion dollars. Most of it is invested in various corporations, but there is roughly four hundred million dollars available in liquid assets.\u0027 Kendall was listening, stunned. \u0027\u0027s more than a hundred million dollars for each of us. I can\u0027t believe it!\u0027 Fmfree, she thought. I can pay them off and be rid of themforever. She looked at Marc, her @ace shining, and squeezed his hand. \u0027,\u0027 Marc said. He knew more than 142 1.1be others what the money would mean. Simon Fitzgerald spoke up. \u0027 you know, ninety-nine percent of the shares in Stanford Enterprises was held by your father. So those shares will be divided . among you. Also, now that his father is deceased, Judge Stanford owns outright that other one percent that had been held in trust. Of course, there will be certain formalities. Furthermore, I should inform you that there is a possibility of another heir being involved.\" heirt Tyler asked. \"Your father\u0027s will specifically provides that the estate is to be divided equally among his issue.\u0027 Peggy looked puzzled. \u0027 ... what do you mean by issuet Tyler spoke up. \u0027-born descendants and legally adopted descendants.\u0027 Fitzgerald nodded. \u0027 is correct. Any descendant born out of wedlock is deemed a descendant of the mother and the father, whose protection is established under the law of the jurisdiction.? , - \u0027 are you saying?\u0027 Woody -asked impatiently. \u0027\u0027m saying that there may be\u0027another claimant.\u0027 Kendall looked at him. \u0027 Simon Fitzgerald hesitated. There was no way to be tactful. \u0027\u0027m sure that you are all aware of the fact that a number of years ago, your father sired a child by a governess who worked here.\" Nelson,\" Tyler said. 143 \u0027. Her daughter was born at St. Joseph\u0027s Hospital in- Milwaukee. She named her Julia.\u0027 The room was thick with silence. \"Hey!\" Woody exclaimed. \u0027 was twenty-five years ago-P \u0027-six, to be exact., Kendall asked, \u0027 anyone know where she is?\u0027 Simon Fitzgerald could hear Harry Stanford\u0027s voice: \u0027 wrote to tell me that it was a girl. Well, ifshe thinks she\u0027s going to get a dirne out of me, she can go to hell.\",\u0027 Fitzgerald said slowly. \u0027 one knows where she is.\" \"Then what the hell are we talking about?\u0027 Woody demanded. \u0027 just wanted all of you to be aware that if she does appear, she will be entitled to an equal share of the estate.\" don\u0027t think we have anything to worry about,\u0027 Woody said confidently. \u0027 probably never even knew who her father was.\u0027 Tyler turned to Simon Fitzgerald. \u0027 say you don\u0027t know the exact amount of the estate. May I ask why not?\" \"Because our firm handles only your father\u0027s personal affairs. His corporate affairs are represented by two other law firms. I\u0027ve been in touch with them and have asked them to prepare financial statements as soon as possible.\" kind of time frame are we talking aboutt 144 @\u0027p Xendall asked anxiously. We will need $100.000 immediately to cover our expenses. \u0027 two to three months.\u0027 Marc saw the consternation on his wife\u0027s face. He Wrned to Fitzgerald. \u0027\u0027t there some way to hurry ,.,things along?\u0027 Steve Sloane answered. \u0027\u0027m afraid not. The will has io go through probate court, and their calendar is rather heavy right now.\" is a probate court?\u0027 Peggy asked. \u0027 is from the past participle of probare - to prove. it\u0027s the act of -\" didn\u0027t ask you for a damned English lesson!\u0027 Woody exploded. \u0027 can\u0027t we just wrap things up no Tyler turned to his brother. \u0027 law doesn\u0027t work that way. When there\u0027s a death, the will has to be filed in the probate court. There has to be an appraisal of all assets - real estate, closely held corporations, cash, jewelry - then an inventory has to be prepared and filed in the court. Taxes have to be taken care of, and specific bequests paid. After that,- a petition is filed for permission to distribute the balance of the estate to the beneficiaries.\u0027 Woody grinned, \u0027 the hell. I\u0027ve waited almost forty years to be a millionaire. I guess I can wait another month or two.\u0027 Simon Fitzgerald stood up. \u0027 from your father\u0027s bequests to you, there are some minor gifts, 145 but they don\u0027t affect the bulk of the estate.\" Fitzgerald looked around the room. \u0027, if there\u0027s nothing else .. Tyler rose. \u0027 think not. Thank you, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Sloane. If there are any problems, we\u0027ll be in touch.\u0027 Fitzgerald nodded to the group. %adies and gentlemen.\u0027 He turned and went toward the door, Steve Sloane following him. Outside, in the driveway, Simon Fitzgerald turned to Steve. \u0027, now you\u0027ve met the family. What do you think?\" was more like a celebration than a mourning. I\u0027m puzzled by something, Simon. If their father hated them as much as they seem to hate him, why did he leave them all that money?\u0027 Simon Fitzgerald shrugged. \u0027\u0027s something we\u0027ll never know. Maybe that\u0027s why he was coming to see me, to leave the money to someone else.\u0027 None of the group was able to sleep that night-, each lost in his or her own thoughts. Tyler was thinking, It\u0027s happened. It\u0027s really happenedl I can afford to give Lee the world Anything! Everything! Kendall was thinking, As soon as I get the money, ru find a way to buy them off permanently, and I\u0027ll make sure they never bother me again. Woody was thinking, I\u0027m going to have the best string 146 of polo ponies in the world. No more borrowing other people\u0027s ponies. rm going to be ten goals! He glanced over at Peggy, sleeping at his side. Thefirst thing I\u0027ll do is get rid of this stupid bitch. Then he thought, No, I can\u0027t do that ... He got out of bed and went into the bathroom. When he came out, he was feeling wonderful. The atmosphere at breakfast the next morning was exuberant. \u0027,\u0027 Woody said happily, \u0027 suppose all of you have been making plans.\u0027 Marc shrugged. \u0027 does one plan for something like this? It is an unbelievable amount of money.\u0027 Tyler looked up. \u0027\u0027s certainly going to change all ur live.. Woody nodded. \u0027 bastard should have given it to us while he was alive, so we could have enjoyed it then. If it\u0027s not impolite to hate the dead, I have to tell you something ...\u0027 Kendall said reproachfully, \"Woody ...\", let\u0027s not be hypocrites.- We all despised him, and he deserved it. Just look what he tried to -\u0027 Clark came into the room. He stood there, apologetically, \u0027 me,\u0027 he said.- \u0027 is a Miss.
