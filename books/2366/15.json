Lee was warm and sensitive and caring, and Tyler felt a closeness to him that he had never had with any other human being. He was flooded With emotions he had not known existed. By morning, Tyler was madly in love. In the past, he had picked up young men at the Cairo and the Bijou Theater and several other gay hangouts in Chicago, but now he knew that all that was going to change. From now on, he wanted only Lee. In the morning, while Tyler was preparing breakfast, he said, \u0027 would you like to do tonightt Lee looked at him in surprise. \u0027. I have a date tonight.\" Tyler felt as though he had been hit in the stomach. \u0027, Lee, I thought that you and I ...\", dear, I\u0027m a very valuable piece of merchandise. I go to the highest bidder. I like you, but I\u0027m afraid you really can\u0027t afford me.\" can give you anything you want,\u0027 Tyler said. Lee smiled lazily. \u0027? Well, what I want is a trip to St. Tropez on a beautiful white yacht. Can you afford thatt \u0027, I\u0027m richer than all your friends put together.\u0027 182 \u0027? I thought you said you are a judge..\", I am, yes, but I\u0027m going to be rich. I mean ... very rich.\u0027 Lee put his arm around him. \u0027\u0027t fret, Tyler. I\u0027m free a week from Thursday. Those eggs, look delicious.\u0027 That was the beginning. Money had been important to Tyler before, but now it became an obsession. He needed it for Lee. He could not get him out of his mind. The thought of him making 16-4e with other men was unbearable. rve got to have him for my own. From the age of twelve, Tyler had known that he was homosexual. One day, his father had caught him fondling and kissing a boy from his school, and Tyler had borne the full brunt of his father\u0027s fury. \u0027 can\u0027t believe I have a son, who\u0027s a faggot! Now that I know your dirty little secret, I\u0027m going to keep a close eye on you, sister.\u0027 Tylet\u0027s marriage was a cosmic joke, perpetrated by a god with a macabre sense of humor. \u0027\u0027s someone I want you, to meet,\u0027 Harry Stanford said. It was Christmas and Tyler was at Rose Hill for the holidays. Kendall and Woody had already made their departures and Tyler was planning his when the bombshell dropped. \u0027\u0027re going to get married.\"? That\u0027s out of the question! I don\u0027t .. 183 \u0027 to me, sister. People are beginning to talk about you, and I can\u0027t have that. It\u0027s bad for my reputation. If you get married, that will shut them UP-0 Tyler was defiant. \u0027 don\u0027t care what people say. This is my life.\" I want it to be a rich life for you, Tyler. I\u0027m getting older. Pretty soon ...\u0027- He shrugged. The carrot and the stick. Naomi Schuyler was a plain-looking woman, from a middle-class family, whose flaming desire in life was to\u0027better\u0027herself. She was so impressed by Harry Stanford\u0027s name that she would probably have married his son if he were pumping gas instead of being a judge. Harry Stanford had taken Naomi to bed once. When someone asked him why, Stanford replied, \u0027 she was there.\" She quickly bored him, and he decided she would be perfect for Tyler. What Harry Stanford wanted, Harry Stanford got. The wedding took place two months later. It was a small wedding - one hundred and fifty people - and the bride and groom went to Jamaica for their honeymoon. It was a fiasco. On their wedding night Naomi said, \u0027 kind of man have I married, for God\u0027s sake? What have you got a dick fort 184 Tyler tried to reason with her. \u0027 don\u0027t need sox. We can live separate lives. We\u0027ll stay together, but we\u0027ll each have our own ... friends.\"\u0027re damned right, we will!\u0027 Naomi took out her vengeance on him by becoming a black-belt shopper. She bought everything at the most expensive stores in the city, and took shopping trips to New York. 11 can\u0027t afford your extravagances on my income,5 Tyler protested. \u0027 get a raise. I\u0027m your wife. I\u0027m entitled to be 5 supported. Tyler went to his father and explained the situation. Harry Stanford grinned. \u0027 can be damned expensive, can\u0027t they9 You\u0027ll just have to handle it.\", Father, I need some - 5 \u0027 you\u0027ll have all the money in the world.\u0027 Tyler tried to explain it to Naomi, but she had no intentions of waiting until \u0027\u0027. She sensed that that \u0027\u0027 might never come. When Naomi had squeezed what she could out of Tyler, she sued for divorce, settled for what was left of his bank account, and disappeared. , When Harry Stanford heard the news, he said,\u0027Once a faggot, always a faggot.\u0027 And that was the end of that. His father went out of his way to demean Tyler. One day, when Tyler was on the bench, in the middle of a 185 trial, his bailiff came up to him and whispered, \u0027 me, Your Honor ...\u0027 Tyler had turned to him, impatiently. \"\u0027s a telephone call for you.\"? What\u0027s the matter with you? I\u0027m in the middle of -\"\u0027s your father, Your, Honor. He says it\u0027s very urgent and he must talk to you immediately.\u0027 Tyler was furious. His father had no right to interrupt him. He was tempted to ignore the call. But on the other hand, if it was that urgent..\u0027. Tyler stood up. \u0027 is recessed for fifteen minutes.\u0027 Tyler hurried into his chambers and picked up the telephone. \" hope I\u0027m not disturbing you, Tyler.\u0027 There was malice in his voice. \u0027 a matter of fact, you are. I\u0027m in the middle of a trial and -\", give him a traffic ticket and forget it.\" .. \u0027 need your help with a serious problem.\" kind of problemt \u0027 chef is stealing from me.\u0027 Tyler could not believe what he was hearing. He was so angry he could hardly speak. \u0027 called me off the bench because ... T \u0027\u0027re the law, aren\u0027t you? Well, he\u0027s breaking the law. I want you to come back to Boston and 186 check out my whole staff. They\u0027re robbing me blind!\u0027 It was all Tyler could do to keep from exploding. \u0027 ...\" just can\u0027t trust those damn employment agencies.\"\u0027m in the middle of a trial. I cantpossibly go to Boston now.$ There was a moment of ominous silence. \u0027 did YOU\u0027 sayt \u0027 said ...\" aren\u0027t to disappoint me again, are you, 90mg Tyler? Maybe I should talk to Fitzgerald abodt some changes in my will.\u0027 And there was the carrot again. The money. His share of the billions of dollars waiting for him when his father died. Tyler cleared his throat. \u0027 you could send your plane for me ...\", no! If you play your cards right, judge, that plane will belong to you one day. Just think about that. Meanwhile, fly commercial like everyone else. But I want you to get your ass back here!\u0027 The Fine went dead. Tyler sat there, filled with humiliation. My father has done this to me all my life. To hell with him! I won\u0027t go. I won\u0027t go.. Tyler flew to Boston that evening. 187 Harry Stanford employed a staff of twenty-two. There was a phalanx of secretaries, butlers, housekeepers, maids, chefs, chauffeurs, gardeners, and a bodyguard. \u0027, every damned one of them,\u0027 Harry Stanford complained to Tyler. \u0027 you\u0027re so worried, why don\u0027t you hire a private detective or go to the policet \u0027 I have you,\u0027 Harry Stanford said. \u0027\u0027re a judge, right? Well, you judge them for me.\u0027 It was pure malevolence. Tyler looked around the huge house with its exquisite furniture and paintings, and he thought of the dreary little house he lived in. This is what I deserve to have, he thought. And one day, r1l have it. Tyler talked to the butler, Clark, and other senior members of the staff. He interviewed the servants, one by one, and checked their resumes. Most of the employees were fairly new because Harry Stanford was an impossible man to work for. The staff turnover at the house was extraordinary. Some of them lasted only a day or two. A few new employees were guilty of petty pilfering, and one was an alcoholic, but other than that, Tyler could see no problem. Except for Dmitri Kaminsky. Dmitri Kaminsky had been hired by his father as a bodyguard and masseur. -Sitting on the bench \u0027 had made Tyler a good judge of character, and there was 188 something about Dmitri that Tyler instantly mistrusted - He was the most recent employee. Harry Stanford\u0027s former bodyguard had quit -, Tyler could imagine why - and he had recommended Kaminsky. The man was huge, with a barrel chest and large, muscular arms. He spoke English with a thick Russian accent. \u0027 want to see met \u0027.\u0027 Tyler gestured to a chair. \u0027, down.\u0027 He had looked at the man\u0027s employment record, and it had told him very little, except that Dmitri had come from Russia recently. \u0027 were born in Russiat \u0027.\u0027 He was watching Tyler warily. \u0027 part?\".\" \"Why did you leave Russia to come to Americat Kaminsky shrugged. \u0027 is more opportunity here.\u0027 Opportunity for what? Tyler wondered. There was something evasive _about the man\u0027s manner. They spoke for twenty minutes, and at the end of -that time , was convinced that Dmitri Kaminsky was concealing something. Tyler telephoned Fred Masterson, an acquaintance of his with the FBI. \u0027, I want you to do me a favor.\" \"Sure. If I\u0027m ever in Chicago, will you fix my traffic ticketst \u0027\u0027m serious.\u0027 189 \u0027.\" want you to check on a Russian who came over here six months ago.\" a minute. You\u0027re talking CIA, aren\u0027t yout \"Maybe, but I don\u0027t know anyone at CIA.\" do U \u0027, if you could do this for me, I would really be grateful.\u0027 Tyler heard a sigh. \"Okay. What\u0027s his namet \u0027 Kaminsky.\"\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I know someone at the Russian Embassy in DC. I\u0027ll see if he has any information on Kaminsky. If not, I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help you.\"\u0027d appreciate it.\u0027 That evening, Tyler had dinner with his father. Subconsciously, Tyler had hoped that his father would have aged, would have become more fragile, more vulnerable with time. Instead, Harry Stan *ford looked hale and hearty, in his prime. He\u0027s going to live forever. Tyler thought despairingly. He\u0027ll outlive all of us. The conversation at dinner was completely one sided. \u0027 just closed a deal to buy the\u0027power company in Hawaii ... - \u0027\u0027m flying over to Amsterdam next week to straighten out some GATT complication ... 190 \u0027 secretary of state has invited me to accompany him to China-\u0027 Tyler scarcely got in a word. At the end of the meal, his father rose. \u0027 are you coming along with the servant problem?\"\u0027m still checkin g them out, Father.\", don\u0027t take forever,\u0027 his father growled, and walked out of the room. The following morning, Tyler received a call from Fred Masterson at the FBI. \"Tyler?\".\" picked a real beauty.\u0027 40ht \u0027 Kaminsky was a hit man for polgoprudnenskaya.\"\u0027 [email protected] /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */ hell is that \u0027\u0027ll explain.

Instead of carrying out the contract, Kaminsky went to him to make a better deal. The polgoprudnenskaya found out about it and put out a contract on Kaminsky. Gangs have a quaint custom over there.

If you know where he is, they\u0027d love to have that information.\u0027 Tyler was thoughtful for a moment. He could not afford to get involved in this. It could mean giving testimony and wasting a lot of tirne. \u0027 have no idea. I was just checking him out for a Russian friend. Thanks, Fred.\u0027 Tyler found Dmitri Kaminsky in his room, reading a hardcore porno magazine. Dmitri rose as Tyler walked into the room. \u0027 want you to pack your things and get out of here.\u0027 Dmitri stared at him. \u0027\u0027s the mattert Tm giving you a choice. You\u0027re either out of here by this afternoon, or I\u0027ll tell the Russian police where you are.\u0027 Dmitri\u0027s face turned pale. \u0027 you understand?\". I understand.\u0027 Tyler went to see his father. He\u0027s going to be pleased, he thought. rve done him a realfavor. He found him in the study. 192 \u0027 checked on all the staff,\u0027 Tyler said, \u0027 ... \" \"I\u0027m im.

The first pawn had been movea d. That had been two years earlier. From time to time, Dmitri had passed on information to Tyler. It was mostly unimportant gossip about Harry Stanford\u0027s latest romance or bits of business that Dmitri had overheard. Tyler had begun to think he had made a ims-, take, that he should have turned Dmitri in to the police. And then the fateful telephone call had come from Sardinia, and the gamble had paid off. \u0027\u0027m with your father on his yacht. He just called his attorney. He\u0027s meeting On in Boston Monday to change his will.\u0027 Tyler thought of all the humiliations his father hadd heaped on him through the years, and he was filled with a terrible rage.
