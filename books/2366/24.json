That was the last thing he wanted . I\u0027ll handle it. Send her into the library.\", sir.\u0027 Tyler\u0027s mind was racing. So the real Julia Stanford had finally showed up. It was fortunate that none of the other members of the family was. home at the moment. He would have to get rid of her immediately. Tyler walked into the library. Julia was standing in the middle of the room, looking at a portrait of Harry Stanford. Tyler stood there a moment, studying the woman. She was beautiful. Jt was too bad that ... \u0027 Julia turned around and saw him. \u0027.\u0027 cyou\u0027re Tyler.\"\u0027s right. Who are yout Her smile faded. \u0027\u0027t ... ? I\u0027m Julia Stanford.\"?

I just assumed - He moved closer to her.\n \"How did you happen to come heregg \u0027 decided that it was time to meet my family.\" twenty-six yearst \u0027.\u0027 Looking at her, listening to her speak, there was no question in Tyler\u0027s mind. She was genuine, dangerous, and would have to be disposed of quickly. Tyler forced a smile. \u0027, you can imagine what a shock this is to me. I mean, for you to appear here out of the blue and. 11 know. I\u0027m sorry. I probably should have called first.\u0027 Tyler asked casually, \u0027 came to Boston alonet \u0027.\u0027 His mind was racing. \u0027 anyone else know you\u0027re heret \"No. Well, my roommate, Sally, in Kansas City.\u0027 \u0027 are you staying?\u0027 . \u0027 the Copley Square Hotel.\"\u0027s a nice hotel. What room are you int \u0027 nineteen.\" right. Why don\u0027t you go back to your hotel and wait there for us? I want to prepare Woody and Kendall for this. They\u0027re going to be as surprised as I was.\u0027 [email protected] in sorry. I should have \u0027 problem. Now that we\u0027ve met, I know that everything is going to be just fine.\" you, Tyler.\"\u0027re welcome\u0027 - he almost choked on the word. \u0027. Let me call a taxi for you.\u0027 Five minutes later, she was gone. Hal Baker had just returned to his hotel room in downtown Boston when the telephone call came. He picked it up. \u0027 \"I\u0027m-sorry. I have no news yet, judge. I\u0027ve combed this whole town. I went to the airport and \u0027\u0027s here, stupid!\" \u0027\u0027s here in Boston. She\u0027s staying at -the Copley Square Hotel, room four nineteen. I want her taken care of tonight. And I don\u0027t want any more bungling, do you understandt \u0027 happened was not my \u0027 you understandt 4Yes, sir.\" do id\u0027 Tyler slammed down the receiver. He went to find Clark. \u0027, about that young woman who was here pretending she was my sistert \u0027, sirt \u0027 wouldn\u0027t say anything about it to the other members of the family. It would just upset them.\" understand, sir.\n You\u0027re very thoughtful.\u0027 Julia walked over to the Ritz-Carlton for dinner. The hotel was beautiful, just as her mother had described it. On Sunday, I used to take the children there for brunch. Julia sat in the dining room and visualized her mother there at a table with young Tyler, Woody and Kendall. I wish I could have grown up with them,-Julia thought. But at least rm going the meet them now. She wondered whether her mother would have approved of what she was doing. Julia had been taken aback by Tyler\u0027s reception. He had seemed ... cold. But that\u0027s only natural, Julia thought. A stranger walks in and says, \u0027 your sister.\u0027 Of course he would be suspicious. But rm sure I can convince them. When the check came, Julia stared at it in shock. I have to be careful, she thought. I have to have enough money left to take the bus back to Kansas. As she stepped outside the Ritz-Carlton, a tour bus was getting ready to leave. On an impulse, she boarded it- She wanted to see as much of her mother\u0027s city as she could. Hal Baker strode into the lobby of the Copley Square Hotel as though he belonged there and took the stairs to the fourth floor. This time there would be no mistake.\n Room 419 was in the middle of the corridor. Hal Baker scanned the hallway to make sure no one was around, and knocked on the door. There was no answer. He knocked again. \u0027. Stanfordt Still no answer. He took a small case from his pocket and selected a pick. It took him only seconds to open the door. Hal Baker stepped inside, closing the door behind him. The room was empty. \u0027. Stanfordt He walked into the bathroom. Empty. He went back into the bedroom. He took a knife out of his pocket, moved a chair in back of the door, and sat in the dark, waiting. It was one hour later when he heard someone approaching. Hal Baker rose quickly and stodd behind the door, the knife in his hands. He heard the key turn in the lock, and the door started to\u0027swing open* \u0027 He raised the knife high over his head, ready to strike. Julia Stanford stepped in and pressed the light switch on. He heard her say, \u0027 well. Come in.\u0027 A crowd of reporters poured into the room. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/morning-noon-and-night/page-24.html","bookId":2366,"book":{"id":2366,"title":"Morning, Noon and Night","description":"Storyline: \n Cruising on his yacht, Harry Stanford, one of the world\u0027s wealthiest men, drowns under mysterious circumstances.
