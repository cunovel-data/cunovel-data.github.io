She had had a bad marriage and had sworn never to get involved with a man again. Julia wasn\u0027t sure what Sally\u0027s definition of never was, because she seemed to be out with a different man every week. \u0027 men are the best,\u0027 Sally philosophized. \u0027 feel guilty, so they\u0027re always buying you presents. With a single man, you have to-ask yourself, why is he still singlet She said to Julia, \u0027 aren\u0027t dating anyone, are YOUT \u0027.\u0027 Julia thought of the men who had wanted to take her out. \u0027 don\u0027t want to go out just for the sake of going out, Sally.

His hair was thick and dark, and his smile exploded disarmingly as he looked at Julia. \u0027 wasn\u0027t exaggerating. You\u0027re a knockout!\" you,\u0027 Julia said. She felt a little shiver of pleasure. \u0027 you ever been to Houston\u0027st - It was one of the finest restaurants in Kansas City. \u0027.\u0027 The truth was that she could not afford to eat at Houston\u0027s. Not even with the raise she had been given.\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s where we have a reservation.\u0027 At dinner, Tony talked mostly about himself, but Julia did not mind. He was entertaining and charming. \u0027\u0027s drop-dead gorgeous,\u0027 Sally had said. And he was. The dinner was delicious. For dessert, Julia had ordered chocolate souffl6and Tony had ice cream. As they were Imigering over coffee, Julia thought, Is he going to ask me to his apartment, and if he does, will I go? No. I can\u0027t do that. Not on the first date.

I\u0027m rather shy myself, so I know. how you must feel, Julia.\u0027 234 She liked him immediately. They went to the Evergreen Chinese Restaurant on State Avenue for dinner.\\n\\n \"You work for an architectural firm. That must be exciting.

She smiled. \u0027 couldn\u0027t agree with you more.\u0027 The evening was delightful, and the more they talked, the more Julia liked him.

Two or three mornings a week, Julia would find herself in the elevator with him.. He seemed. a pleasant enough man. He was in his thirties, quietly intelligentlooking, sandy-haired, and he wore black-rimmed glasses. The acquaintance began with polite nods, then, \u0027 morning,\u0027 then, \u0027\u0027re looking very well today,\u0027 and after a few months, \u0027 wonder if you\u0027d like to have dinner with me some evenine.\u0027 He was 235 watching her eagerly, waiting for an answer. Julia smiled. \u0027 right.\u0027 It was -instant love on Henry\u0027s part. On their first date, he took Julia to EBT, one of the top restaurants in Kansas City. He was obviously thrilled to be out with her. He told her a little about himself. \u0027 was born right here in good old KC. My father was born here, too. The acorn doesn\u0027t fall far from the oak. You know what I meant Julia knew what he meant. \u0027 always knew I wanted to be an accountant. When I got out of school, I went to work for the Bigelow \u0026 Benson Financial Corporation.\\n\\n Now I have my own firm.\"\u0027s nice,\u0027 Julia said. \u0027\u0027s about all there is to tell about me.

I\u0027m an heiress to his estate. She looked around the elegant room. I could buy this restaurant, if I wanted to. I couldprobably buy this whole town, if I wanted to. Henry was staring at her. \u0027?\"! I ... I\u0027m sorry. I was born in Milwaukee. My . my father died when I was young. My mother and I traveled around the country a great deal. When she 236 passed away, I decided to stay here and get a job.\u0027 I hope my nose isn\u0027t growing- Henry Wesson put a hand over hers. \u0027 you\u0027ve never had a man to take care of you.\u0027 He leaned forward and said earnestly, \u0027 would like to take care of YOU for the rest of your life.\u0027 Julia looked at him in surprise. \u0027 don\u0027t mean to sound like Doris Day, but we hardly know each other.\" want to change that.\u0027 When Julia got home, Sally was waiting for her.\u0027Well?\u0027 she asked. \u0027 did your date got Julia said, thoughtfully, \u0027\u0027s very sweet, and .. \u0027\u0027s crazy about you!\u0027 Julia smiled. \u0027 think he proposed.\u0027 Sally\u0027s, eyes widened. \u0027 think he proposed?

Marry him! Quick! M arry him before he changes his mind!\u0027 Julia laughed. \u0027\u0027s the hurry?\"\\n\\n \"Listen to me. Invite him over here for dinner. I\u0027ll cook it,, and you tell him you made it.\u0027 Julia laughed. \u0027 you. No. When I find the man I want to marry, we may be. eating Chinese food out 237 of cartons, but believe me, the dinner table will be beautifully set with flowers and candlelight.\u0027 On their next date, Henry said, \u0027 know, Kansas City is a great place to bring up kids.\", it is.\u0027 Julia\u0027s only problem was that she wasn\u0027t sure that she wanted to bring up his children. He was reliable, sober, decent, but.. She discussed it with Sally. \u0027 keeps asking me to marry him,\u0027 Julia said. \u0027\u0027s he liket She thought for a moment, trying to think of the most romantic and exciting things she could say about Henry Wesson. \u0027\u0027s reliable, sober, decent ... \" Sally looked at her a moment. \u0027 other words, he\u0027s dull.\u0027 Julia said defensively, \u0027 isn\u0027t exactly dull.\u0027 Sally nodded, knowingly. \u0027\u0027s dull. Marry him.\" \u0027 him. Good dull husbands are hard to find.\u0027 Getting from one payday to the next was a financial minefield.\\n\\n There were paycheck deductions, and rent, and automobile expenses, and groceries, and clothes to buy. Julia owned a Toyota Tercel, and it seemed to her that she spent more on it than she did on herself. She was constantly borrowing money from Sally. 238 One evening, when Julia was getting dressed, Sally said, \u0027\u0027s another big Henry night, huh? Where\u0027s he taking you tonigliff \u0027\u0027re going to Symphony Hall. Cleo Laine is performing.\" old Henry proposed against Julia hesitated. The truth was that Henry proposed every time they were together. She felt pressured, but she could not bring herself to say i6s. \u0027\u0027t lose him,\" Sally warned. Sally is Probably right, Julia thought. Henry Wesson would make, a good husband He\u0027s ... She hesitated. Be\u0027s sober, reliable, decent ... Is that enough? As Julia was going out the door, Sally called, Can I borrow your black shoest \u0027.\u0027 And Julia was gone. Sally went into Julia\u0027s bedroom and opened the closet door- The pair of shoes she wanted was on the top shelf As she reached for them, a cardboard box that was sitting precariously on the shelf fell down, and its contents spilled out all over the floor. \u0027!\u0027 Sally bent down to, gather up the papers.\\n\\n They consisted of dozens of newspaper clippings, photographs, and articles, and they were all about the Harry Stanford family. There seemed to be hundreds of them. Suddenly, Julia came hurrying back into the room. \u0027 forgot my -\u0027 She stopped as she saw the papers on the floor. \u0027 are you doing?\u0027\\n\\n [email protected]\\n\\n /* */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t\u003ddocument.currentScript||function(){for(t\u003ddocument.getElementsByTagName(\u0027script\u0027),e\u003dt.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(\u0027data-cfhash\u0027))return t[e]}();if(t\u0026\u0026(c\u003dt.previousSibling)){p\u003dt.parentNode;if(a\u003dc.getAttribute(\u0027data-cfemail\u0027)){for(e\u003d\u0027\u0027,r\u003d\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(0,2)|0,n\u003d2;a.length-n;n+\u003d2)e+\u003d\u0027%\u0027+(\u00270\u0027+(\u00270x\u0027+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* */\\n\\n sorry,\u0027 Sally apologized. \u0027 box fell down.\u0027 239 Blushing, Julia bent down and started putting the papers back in the box. \u0027 had no idea you were so interested in the rich and famous,\u0027 Sally said. Silently, Julia kept shoving the papers into the box. As she gathered a handful of photographs, she came across a small gold heart-shaped locket ; her mother had given her before she died. Julia put the locket aside. Sally was studying-her, puzzled.\\n\\n \"Juliat \u0027.\" are you so interested in Harry Stanfordt \u0027\u0027m not. I ...
