He had come on duty at six o\u0027clock that evening, and had automatically checked the hotel register, When he came across the name of Julia Stanford, he stared at it in surprise.\\n\\n Ever since Harry Stanford had died, the newspapers had been full of stones about the Stanford family. They had dredged up the ancient scandal of Stanford\u0027s affair with the children\u0027s governess and the suicide of Stanford-s wife. Harry Stanford had an illegitimate daughter named Julia. There were rumors that she had come to Boston in secret.\\n\\n Shortly after going on a shopping spree, she had reportedly left for South America. Now, it seemed that she was back. And she\u0027s staying at my hotel! Gordon Wellman thought excitedly. He turned to the front-desk clerk. \u0027 you know how much publicity this could mean for the hotelt A minute later, he was on the telephone to the press. When Julia arrived back at the hotel after her sightseeing tour, the lobby was filled with reporters, - eagerly awaiting her. As soon as she walked into the lobby, they pounced. \u0027. Stanford! I\u0027m from the Boston Globe.\\n\\n We\u0027ve been looking for you, but we heard that you had left town. Could you tell us.. I T A television camera was pointed at her. \u0027. Stanford, I\u0027m with WCVB-TV. We\u0027d like to get a statement from you ...\". Stanford, I\u0027m from the Boston Phoenix. We want to know your reaction to.\\n\\n - .\" this way, Miss. Stanford! Smile! Thank you.\u0027 Flashes were popping. Julia stood there, filled with confusion. Oh, my God, she thought. Thefainfly is going to think that rm some kind of publicity hound. She turned to the reporters. \u0027\u0027m sorry. I have nothing to say.\" She fled into the elevator. They piled in after her. \u0027 magazine wants to do a story on your life, and what it feels like to be estranged from your family for over twenty-five years.\u0027 -Ve heard you had gone to South America.\" you planning to live in Boston ... T \u0027 aren\u0027t you staying at Rose Hill ... T She got out of the elevator at the fourth floor and hurried down the corridor. They were at her heels.\\n\\n There was no way to escape them. Julia took out her key and opened the door to her room. She stepped inside and turned on the light. \u0027 well. Come in.\u0027 Hidden behind the door, Hal Baker was caught by surprise, the knife in his raised hand. As the reporters shoved past him, he quickly put the knife back in his pocket and mingled with the group..Julia turned to the reporters. \u0027 right. One question at a time, please.\u0027 Frustrated, Baker backed toward the door and slipped out.\\n\\n Judge Stanford was not going to be pleased. For the next thirty minutes, Julia answered questions as best she could. Finally, they were gone.\\n\\n Julia locked the door and went to bed. In the morning, the television stations and newspapers featured stories about Julia Stanford. Tyler read the papers and was furious. Woody and Kendall joined him at the breakfast table. \u0027\u0027s all this nonsense about some woman calling herself Julia Stanfordt Woody asked. \u0027? s a phony,\u0027 Tyler said glibly.\\n\\n \"She came to the door yesterday, demanding money, and I sent her away. I didn\u0027t expect her to pull a cheap publicity stunt like this. Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll take care of her.\u0027 He put in a call to Simon Fitzgerald.\\n\\n \"Have you seen the morning paperst \u0027.\u0027 she\u0027T\u0027shisurconistaerrtist is going around town claiming that Fitzgerald said, \u0027 you want me to have her arrested?\"! That would only create more publicity\". I want you to get her out of town.\" right. I\u0027ll take care, of it, Judge Stanford.\" you.\u0027 Simon Fitzgerald sent for\u0027Steve Sloane. \u0027\u0027s a problem,\u0027 he said. Steve nodded. \u0027 know. I\u0027ve heard the morning news and seen the papers. Who is shet \u0027 someone who thinks she can horn in on the family fortune. Judge Stanford suggested we get her out of town. Will you handle hert \u0027 pleasure,\u0027 Steve said grimly. One hour later, Steve was knocking on Julia\u0027s hotel room door. When Julia opened the door and saw him standing there she said, \u0027\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m not talking to any more reporters. I \u0027\u0027m not a reporter. May I come int \"Who are yout \u0027 name is Steve Sloane. I\u0027m with the law firm representing the Harry Stanford estate.\". I see. Yes. Come in.\" Steve walked into the room. \u0027 you tell the press that you are Julia Stanford?\"\u0027m afraid I was caught off guard. I didn\u0027t expect them, you see, and. - .\" you didclaim to be Harry Stanford\u0027s daughtert \u0027. I am his daughter.\u0027 He looked at her and said cynically, \"Of course, you have proof of that.\", no,\u0027 Julia said slowly. \u0027 don\u0027t.\" on,\u0027 Steve insisted. \u0027 must have some proof.\u0027 He intended to nail her with her own lies. \u0027 have nothing,\u0027 she said. He studied her, surprised. She was not what he had expected. There was a disarming frankness about her. She seems intelligent. How could she have been stupid enough to come here claiming to be ffarry Stanford\u0027s daughter without any proof? \u0027\u0027s too bad,\u0027 Steve said. \u0027 Stanford wants you to get out of town.\u0027 Julia\u0027s eyes widened. \u0027 \"That\u0027s right.\" ... I don\u0027t understand. I haven\u0027t even met my other brother or sister.\u0027 So she\u0027s determined to keep up the bluff, Steve thought. \u0027, I don\u0027t know who you are, or what your game is, but you could go to jail for this. We\u0027re giving you a break. What you\u0027re doing is against the law. You have a choice. Either you can get out of town and stop bothering the family, or we can have you arrested.\u0027 Julia stood there in shock. \u0027? I ... I don, t know what to say.\"\u0027s your decision.\" don\u0027t even want to see met Julia asked numbly. \u0027\u0027s putting it mildly.\u0027 She took a deep breath. \u0027 right. If that\u0027s what they want, I\u0027ll go back to Kansas. I promise you, they\u0027ll never hear from me again.\u0027 Kansas. You came a long way to pull your little scam.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s very wise.\u0027 He stood there a moment, watching her, puzzled.\\n\\n \"Well, good-bye.\u0027 She did not reply. Steve was in Simon Fitzgerald\u0027s office. \u0027 you see the woman, Stevet \u0027. She\u0027s going back home.\u0027 He seemed distracted. \u0027. I\u0027ll tell Judge Stanford. He\u0027ll be pleased.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know what\u0027s bugging me, Simont \" dog didn\u0027t bark.\" beg your pardont \u0027 Sherlock Holmes story. The clue was in what didn\u0027t happen.\", what does that have to do with \u0027 came here without any proof. I Fitzgerald looked at him, puzzled. \u0027 don\u0027t understand.\\n\\n That should have convinced you.\" the contrary. Why would she come here, all the way from Kansas, claiming to be Harry Stanford\u0027s daughter, and not have a single thing to back it upt \u0027 are a lot of weirdos out there, Steve.\"\u0027s not a weirdo. You should have seen her. And there are a couple of other things that bother me, Simon.\"\\n\\n \"Yes?\" Stanford\u0027s body disappeared. When I went to talk to Dmitri Kaminsky, the only witness to Stanford\u0027s accident, he had disappeared ... And no one seems to know where the first Julia Stanford suddenly disappeared to.\u0027 Simon Fitzgerald was frowning. \u0027 are you s . T aying. Steve said, slowly, \u0027\u0027s something going on that needs to be explained. I\u0027m going to have another talk with the lady.\u0027 Steve Sloane walked into the lobby of the Copley Square Hotel and approached the desk clerk. \u0027 you ring Miss. Julia Stanford, pleaset The clerk looked up.\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry. Miss. Stanford has checked out.\" she leave a forwarding address?\", sir. I\u0027m afraid not.\u0027 Steve stood there, frustrated. There was nothing more he could do. Well, maybe I was wrong, he thought philosophically. Maybe she really is an impostor. Now we\u0027ll never know. He turned and went out into the street. The doorman was ushering a couple into a taxi. \u0027 me,\u0027 Steve said. The doorman turned. \u0027, sir?\". I want to ask you a question. Did you see Miss. Stanford come out of the hotel this morning?.\" certainly did.\\n\\n Everybody was staring at her. She\u0027s quite a celebrity. I got a taxi for her.\" don\u0027t suppose you know where she went?\u0027 He found that he was holding his breath. \u0027. I told the cab driver where to take her.\" \"And where was that Steve asked impatiently. \u0027 the Greyhound bus terminal at South Station. I thought it was strange that someone as rich as that would ...\" do want a taxi.\u0027 Steve walked into the crowded Greyhound bus terminal and looked around. Julia was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\n She\u0027s gone, Steve thought despairingly. A voice on a loudspeaker was calling out the departing buses. He heard the voice say, \u0027... and Kansas City,\u0027 and Steve hurried out to the loading platform. Julia was just starting to get on the bus. \u0027 it!\u0027 he called. She turned, startled. Steve hurried up to her. \u0027 want to talk to you.\u0027 She looked at him, angry. \u0027 have nothing more to say to you.\u0027 She turned to go.\\n\\n IRL He grabbed her arm. \u0027 a minute! We really have to talk.\" bus is leaving.\"\u0027ll be another one.\" suitcase is on it.\" Steve turned to a porter. \u0027 woman is about to have a baby. Get her suitcase out of there. Quick!\u0027 The porter looked at Julia in surprise.\\n\\n \"Right.\u0027 He hurriedly opened the luggage compartment. \u0027 is yours, lady?\u0027 Julia turned to Steve, puzzled. \u0027 you know what you\u0027re doing?\"\\n\\n \"No,\u0027 Steve said. She studied him a moment, then made a decision. She pointed to, her suitcase. \u0027 one.\u0027 The porter pulled it out. \u0027 you want me to get you an ambulance or anything?\"\\n\\n \"hank you. I\u0027ll be fine.\" Steve picked up the suitcase, and they headed for the exit. \u0027 you had breakfastt \u0027\u0027m not hungry,\u0027 she said coldly. \u0027\u0027d better have something. You\u0027re eating for two now, you know.\u0027 They had breakfast at Julien. Julia sat across from Steve, her body rigid with anger. When they had ordered, Steve said, \u0027\u0027m curious about something. What made you think you could claim part of the Stanford estate without any proof at all of your identity?\u0027 She looked at him indignantly. \u0027 didn\u0027t go there to claim part of the Stanford estate. My father wouldn\u0027t have left anything to me. I wanted to meet my family. Obviously they didn\u0027t want to meet me.\" you have any documents ... any kind of proof at all of who you are?\u0027 She thought of all the clippings piled up in her apartment and shook her head. \u0027. Nothing.\"\u0027s someone I want you to talk to.\" is Simon Fitzgerald.\u0027 Steve hesitated. \u0027 ... \u0027 Stanford.\u0027 Fitzgerald said skeptically, \u0027 down, miss.\u0027 Julia sat on the edge of a chair, ready to get up and walk out. Fitzgerald was studying her. She had the Stanford deep gray eyes, but so did lots of other people. \u0027 claim you\u0027re Rosemary Nelson\u0027s daughter.\" don\u0027t claim anything. I am Rosemary Nelson\u0027s daughter.\" where is your mother?\" died a number of years ago.\", I\u0027m sorry to hear that.\\n\\n Could you tell us about her?\",\u0027Julia said. \u0027 really would rather not.\u0027She stood up. \u0027 want to get out of here.\", we\u0027re trying to help you,\u0027 Steve said. She turned on him. \u0027 you? My family doesn9t want to see me. You want to turn me over to the police. I don\u0027t need that kind of help.\u0027 She started toward the door. Steve said, \u0027!\\n\\n If you are who you say you are, you must have something that will prove you\u0027re Harry Stanford9s daughter.\" told you, I don\u0027t,\u0027 Julia said.\\n\\n \"My mother and I shut Harry Stanford out of our lives.\" did. your mother look liket Simon Fitzgerald asked. \u0027 was beautiful,\u0027 Julia said. Her voice softened. \u0027 was the loveliest ...\u0027 She remembered something. \u0027 have a picture of her.\u0027 She took a small gold heart shaped locket from around her neck and handed it to Fitzgerald. He looked at her a moment, then opened the locket. On one side was a picture of Harry Stanford, and on the other side a picture of Rosemary Nelson. The inscription read TO R.N. wrrh LOVE, H.s. The date was 1969. Simon Fitzgerald stared at the locket for a long time. When he looked up, his voice was husky. \u0027 owe you an apology, my dear.\u0027 He turned to Steve.\\n\\n \"This is Julia Stanford.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/morning-noon-and-night/page-25.html","bookId":2366,"book":{"id":2366,"title":"Morning, Noon and Night","description":"Storyline: Cruising on his yacht, Harry Stanford, one of the world\u0027s wealthiest men, drowns under mysterious circumstances.
