You should see how lovely the campus is. \\n\\n I think you might come and look at it for yourself. Master Jervie \\n\\n dropped in again last Friday--but he chose a most unpropitious time, \\n\\n for Sallie and Julia and I were just running to catch a train. \\n\\n And where do you think we were going? To Princeton, to attend a dance \\n\\n and a ball game, if you please! I didn\u0027t ask you if I might go, \\n\\n because I had a feeling that your secretary would say no. But it \\n\\n was entirely regular; we had leave-of-absence from college, and Mrs. \\n\\n McBride chaperoned us. We had a charming time--but I shall have to \\n\\n omit details; they are too many and complicated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Saturday \\n\\n \\n\\n Up before dawn! The night watchman called us--six of us--and we \\n\\n made coffee in a chafing dish (you never saw so many grounds!) \\n\\n and walked two miles to the top of One Tree Hill to see the sun rise. \\n\\n We had to scramble up the last slope! The sun almost beat us! \\n\\n And perhaps you think we didn\u0027t bring back appetites to breakfast! \\n\\n \\n\\n Dear me, Daddy, I seem to have a very ejaculatory style today; \\n\\n this page is peppered with exclamations. \\n\\n \\n\\n I meant to have written a lot about the budding trees and the new \\n\\n cinder path in the athletic field, and the awful lesson we have in \\n\\n biology for tomorrow, and the new canoes on the lake, and Catherine \\n\\n Prentiss who has pneumonia, and Prexy\u0027s Angora kitten that strayed \\n\\n from home and has been boarding in Fergussen Hall for two weeks \\n\\n until a chambermaid reported it, and about my three new dresses-- \\n\\n white and pink and blue polka dots with a hat to match--but I am \\n\\n too sleepy. I am always making this an excuse, am I not? But a girls\u0027 \\n\\n college is a busy place and we do get tired by the end of the day! \\n\\n Particularly when the day begins at dawn. \\n\\n Affectionately, \\n\\n Judy \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59775.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
