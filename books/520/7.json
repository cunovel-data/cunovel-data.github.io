It\u0027s blue and mahogany with little streaks of orange. Julia Pendleton tried for the team, but she didn\u0027t get in. Hooray! You see what a mean disposition I have. College gets nicer and nicer. I like the girls and the teachers and the classes and the campus and the things to eat. We have ice-cream twice a week and we never have corn-meal mush. You only wanted to hear from me once a month, didn\u0027t you? And I\u0027ve been peppering you with letters every few days! But I\u0027ve been so excited about all these new adventures that I MUST talk to somebody; and you\u0027re the only one I know. Please excuse my exuberance; I\u0027ll settle pretty soon. If my letters bore you, you can always toss them into the wastebasket. I promise not to write another till the middle of November.
