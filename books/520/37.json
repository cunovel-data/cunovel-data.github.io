{"id":44703,"no":37,"title":"11th April","content":"Dearest Daddy, \n \n Will you please forgive me for the letter I wrote you yesterday? \n After I posted it I was sorry, and tried to get it back, but that \n beastly mail clerk wouldn\u0027t give it back to me. \n \n It\u0027s the middle of the night now; I\u0027ve been awake for hours \n thinking what a Worm I am--what a Thousand-legged Worm-- \n and that\u0027s the worst I can say! I\u0027ve closed the door very softly \n into the study so as not to wake Julia and Sallie, and am sitting \n up in bed writing to you on paper torn out of my history note-book. \n \n I just wanted to tell you that I am sorry I was so impolite \n about your cheque. I know you meant it kindly, and I think you\u0027re \n an old dear to take so much trouble for such a silly thing as a hat. \n I ought to have returned it very much more graciously. \n \n But in any case, I had to return it. It\u0027s different with me than \n with other girls. They can take things naturally from people. \n They have fathers and brothers and aunts and uncles; but I can\u0027t \n be on any such relations with any one. I like to pretend that you \n belong to me, just to play with the idea, but of course I know you \n don\u0027t. I\u0027m alone, really--with my back to the wall fighting the world-- \n and I get sort of gaspy when I think about it. I put it out of my mind, \n and keep on pretending; but don\u0027t you see, Daddy? I can\u0027t accept \n any more money than I have to, because some day I shall be wanting \n to pay it back, and even as great an author as I intend to be won\u0027t \n be able to face a PERFECTLY TREMENDOUS debt. \n \n I\u0027d love pretty hats and things, but I mustn\u0027t mortgage the future \n to pay for them. \n \n You\u0027ll forgive me, won\u0027t you, for being so rude? I have an awful \n habit of writing impulsively when I first think things, and then \n posting the letter beyond recall. But if I sometimes seem thoughtless \n and ungrateful, I never mean it. In my heart I thank you always \n for the life and freedom and independence that you have given me. \n My childhood was just a long, sullen stretch of revolt, and now I am \n so happy every moment of the day that I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s true. \n I feel like a made-up heroine in a story-book. \n \n It\u0027s a quarter past two. I\u0027m going to tiptoe out to post this \n off now. You\u0027ll receive it in the next mail after the other; \n so you won\u0027t have a very long time to think bad of me. \n Good night, Daddy, \n I love you always, \n Judy \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59759.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
