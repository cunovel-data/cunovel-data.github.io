{"id":44698,"no":32,"title":"4th February","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, Jimmie McBride has sent me a Princeton banner as big as one end of the room; I am very grateful to him for remembering me, but I don\u0027t know what on earth to do with it. Sallie and Julia won\u0027t let me hang it up; our room this year is furnished in red, and you can imagine what an effect we\u0027d have if I added orange and black. But it\u0027s such nice, warm, thick felt, I hate to waste it. Would it be very improper to have it made into a bath robe? My old one shrank when it was washed. I\u0027ve entirely omitted of late telling you what I am learning, but though you might not imagine it from my letters, my time is exclusively occupied with study. It\u0027s a very bewildering matter to get educated in five branches at once. `The test of true scholarship,\u0027 says Chemistry Professor, `is a painstaking passion for detail.\u0027 `Be careful not to keep your eyes glued to detail,\u0027 says History Professor. `Stand far enough away to get a perspective of the whole.\u0027 You can see with what nicety we have to trim our sails between chemistry and history. I like the historical method best. If I say that William the Conqueror came over in 1492, and Columbus discovered America in 1100 or 1066 or whenever it was, that\u0027s a mere detail that the Professor overlooks. It gives a feeling of security and restfulness to the history recitation, that is entirely lacking in chemistry. Sixth-hour bell--I must go to the laboratory and look into a little matter of acids and salts and alkalis. I\u0027ve burned a hole as big as a plate in the front of my chemistry apron, with hydrochloric acid. If the theory worked, I ought to be able to neutralize that hole with good strong ammonia, oughtn\u0027t I? Examinations next week, but who\u0027s afraid? Yours ever, Judy","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59754.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
