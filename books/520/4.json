{"id":44670,"no":4,"title":"Wednesday","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, I\u0027ve changed my name. I\u0027m still `Jerusha\u0027 in the catalogue, but I\u0027m `Judy\u0027 everywhere else. It\u0027s really too bad, isn\u0027t it, to have to give yourself the only pet name you ever had? I didn\u0027t quite make up the Judy though. That\u0027s what Freddy Perkins used to call me before he could talk plainly. I wish Mrs. Lippett would use a little more ingenuity about choosing babies\u0027 names. She gets the last names out of the telephone book-- you\u0027ll find Abbott on the first page--and she picks the Christian names up anywhere; she got Jerusha from a tombstone. I\u0027ve always hated it; but I rather like Judy. It\u0027s such a silly name. It belongs to the kind of girl I\u0027m not--a sweet little blue-eyed thing, petted and spoiled by all the family, who romps her way through life without any cares. Wouldn\u0027t it be nice to be like that? Whatever faults I may have, no one can ever accuse me of having been spoiled by my family! But it\u0027s great fun to pretend I\u0027ve been. In the future please always address me as Judy. Do you want to know something? I have three pairs of kid gloves. I\u0027ve had kid mittens before from the Christmas tree, but never real kid gloves with five fingers. I take them out and try them on every little while. It\u0027s all I can do not to wear them to classes. (Dinner bell. Goodbye.)","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59726.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
