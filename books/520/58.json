{"id":44724,"no":58,"title":"3rd October","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, Back at college and a Senior--also editor of the Monthly. It doesn\u0027t seem possible, does it, that so sophisticated a person, just four years ago, was an inmate of the John Grier Home? We do arrive fast in America! What do you think of this? A note from Master Jervie directed to Lock Willow and forwarded here. He\u0027s sorry, but he finds that he can\u0027t get up there this autumn; he has accepted an invitation to go yachting with some friends. Hopes I\u0027ve had a nice summer and am enjoying the country. And he knew all the time that I was with the McBrides, for Julia told him so! You men ought to leave intrigue to women; you haven\u0027t a light enough touch. Julia has a trunkful of the most ravishing new clothes--an evening gown of rainbow Liberty crepe that would be fitting raiment for the angels in Paradise. And I thought that my own clothes this year were unprecedentedly (is there such a word?) beautiful. I copied Mrs. Paterson\u0027s wardrobe with the aid of a cheap dressmaker, and though the gowns didn\u0027t turn out quite twins of the originals, I was entirely happy until Julia unpacked. But now--I live to see Paris! Dear Daddy, aren\u0027t you glad you\u0027re not a girl? I suppose you think that the fuss we make over clothes is too absolutely silly? It is. No doubt about it. But it\u0027s entirely your fault. Did you ever hear about the learned Herr Professor who regarded unnecessary adornment with contempt and favoured sensible, utilitarian clothes for women? His wife, who was an obliging creature, adopted `dress reform.\u0027 And what do you think he did? He eloped with a chorus girl. Yours ever, Judy PS. The chamber-maid in our corridor wears blue checked gingham aprons. I am going to get her some brown ones instead, and sink the blue ones in the bottom of the lake. I have a reminiscent chill every time I look at them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59780.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
