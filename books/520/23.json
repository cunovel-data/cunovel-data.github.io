{"id":44689,"no":23,"title":"LOCK WILLOW, 12th July","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n How did your secretary come to know about Lock Willow? \\n\\n (That isn\u0027t a rhetorical question. I am awfully curious to know.) \\n\\n For listen to this: Mr. Jervis Pendleton used to own this farm, \\n\\n but now he has given it to Mrs. Semple who was his old nurse. \\n\\n Did you ever hear of such a funny coincidence? She still calls him \\n\\n `Master Jervie\u0027 and talks about what a sweet little boy he used to be. \\n\\n She has one of his baby curls put away in a box, and it is red-- \\n\\n or at least reddish! \\n\\n \\n\\n Since she discovered that I know him, I have risen very much \\n\\n in her opinion. Knowing a member of the Pendleton family \\n\\n is the best introduction one can have at Lock Willow. \\n\\n And the cream of the whole family is Master Jervis-- \\n\\n I am pleased to say that Julia belongs to an inferior branch. \\n\\n \\n\\n The farm gets more and more entertaining. I rode on a hay \\n\\n wagon yesterday. We have three big pigs and nine little piglets, \\n\\n and you should see them eat. They are pigs! We\u0027ve oceans \\n\\n of little baby chickens and ducks and turkeys and guinea fowls. \\n\\n You must be mad to live in a city when you might live on a farm. \\n\\n \\n\\n It is my daily business to hunt the eggs. I fell off a beam in the \\n\\n barn loft yesterday, while I was trying to crawl over to a nest that \\n\\n the black hen has stolen. And when I came in with a scratched knee, \\n\\n Mrs. Semple bound it up with witch-hazel, murmuring all the time, \\n\\n `Dear! Dear! It seems only yesterday that Master Jervie fell off \\n\\n that very same beam and scratched this very same knee.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The scenery around here is perfectly beautiful. There\u0027s a valley \\n\\n and a river and a lot of wooded hills, and way in the distance \\n\\n a tall blue mountain that simply melts in your mouth. \\n\\n \\n\\n We churn twice a week; and we keep the cream in the spring house \\n\\n which is made of stone with the brook running underneath. \\n\\n Some of the farmers around here have a separator, but we don\u0027t \\n\\n care for these new-fashioned ideas. It may be a little harder \\n\\n to separate the cream in pans, but it\u0027s sufficiently better to pay. \\n\\n We have six calves; and I\u0027ve chosen the names for all of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n 1. Sylvia, because she was born in the woods. \\n\\n \\n\\n 2. Lesbia, after the Lesbia in Catullus. \\n\\n \\n\\n 3. Sallie. \\n\\n \\n\\n 4. Julia--a spotted, nondescript animal. \\n\\n \\n\\n 5. Judy, after me. \\n\\n \\n\\n 6. Daddy-Long-Legs. You don\u0027t mind, do you, Daddy? He\u0027s pure \\n\\n Jersey and has a sweet disposition. He looks like this--you can \\n\\n see how appropriate the name is. \\n\\n \\n\\n I haven\u0027t had time yet to begin my immortal novel; the farm \\n\\n keeps me too busy. \\n\\n Yours always, \\n\\n Judy \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. I\u0027ve learned to make doughnuts. \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. (2) If you are thinking of raising chickens, let me recommend \\n\\n Buff Orpingtons. They haven\u0027t any pin feathers. \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. (3) I wish I could send you a pat of the nice, fresh butter \\n\\n I churned yesterday. I\u0027m a fine dairy-maid! \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. (4) This is a picture of Miss Jerusha Abbott, the future \\n\\n great author, driving home the cows. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59745.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
