Of course we\u0027re pleased-- \n but oh, if we could only beat the juniors! I\u0027d be willing to be black \n and blue all over and stay in bed a week in a witch-hazel compress. \n \n Sallie has invited me to spend the Christmas vacation with her. \n She lives in Worcester, Massachusetts. Wasn\u0027t it nice of her? \n I shall love to go. I\u0027ve never been in a private family in my life, \n except at Lock Willow, and the Semples were grown-up and old and \n don\u0027t count. But the McBrides have a houseful of children (anyway two \n or three) and a mother and father and grandmother, and an Angora cat. \n It\u0027s a perfectly complete family! Packing your trunk and going \n away is more fun than staying behind. I am terribly excited at \n the prospect. \n \n Seventh hour--I must run to rehearsal. I\u0027m to be in the \n Thanksgiving theatricals. A prince in a tower with a velvet \n tunic and yellow curls. Isn\u0027t that a lark? \n Yours, \n J. A. \n \n Saturday \n \n Do you want to know what I look like? Here\u0027s a photograph of all \n three that Leonora Fenton took. \n \n The light one who is laughing is Sallie, and the tall one with her \n nose in the air is Julia, and the little one with the hair blowing \n across her face is Judy--she is really more beautiful than that, \n but the sun was in her eyes. \n \n \n \n `STONE GATE\u0027, \n WORCESTER, MASS., \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59750.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
