{"id":44688,"no":22,"title":"LOCK WILLOW FARM, Saturday night","content":"Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs, I\u0027ve only just come and I\u0027m not unpacked, but I can\u0027t wait to tell you how much I like farms. This is a heavenly, heavenly, HEAVENLY spot! The house is square like this: And OLD. A hundred years or so. It has a veranda on the side which I can\u0027t draw and a sweet porch in front. The picture really doesn\u0027t do it justice--those things that look like feather dusters are maple trees, and the prickly ones that border the drive are murmuring pines and hemlocks. It stands on the top of a hill and looks way off over miles of green meadows to another line of hills. That is the way Connecticut goes, in a series of Marcelle waves; and Lock Willow Farm is just on the crest of one wave. The barns used to be across the road where they obstructed the view, but a kind flash of lightning came from heaven and burnt them down. The people are Mr. and Mrs. Semple and a hired girl and two hired men. The hired people eat in the kitchen, and the Semples and Judy in the dining-room. We had ham and eggs and biscuits and honey and jelly-cake and pie and pickles and cheese and tea for supper-- and a great deal of conversation. I have never been so entertaining in my life; everything I say appears to be funny. I suppose it is, because I\u0027ve never been in the country before, and my questions are backed by an all-inclusive ignorance. The room marked with a cross is not where the murder was committed, but the one that I occupy. It\u0027s big and square and empty, with adorable old-fashioned furniture and windows that have to be propped up on sticks and green shades trimmed with gold that fall down if you touch them. And a big square mahogany table-- I\u0027m going to spend the summer with my elbows spread out on it, writing a novel. Oh, Daddy, I\u0027m so excited! I can\u0027t wait till daylight to explore. It\u0027s 8.30 now, and I am about to blow out my candle and try to go to sleep. We rise at five. Did you ever know such fun? I can\u0027t believe this is really Judy. You and the Good Lord give me more than I deserve. I must be a very, very, VERY good person to pay. I\u0027m going to be. You\u0027ll see. Good night, Judy PS. You should hear the frogs sing and the little pigs squeal and you should see the new moon! I saw it over my right shoulder.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59744.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
