{"id":44710,"no":44,"title":"25th August","content":"Well, Daddy, Master Jervie\u0027s here. And such a nice time as we\u0027re having! At least I am, and I think he is, too--he has been here ten days and he doesn\u0027t show any signs of going. The way Mrs. Semple pampers that man is scandalous. If she indulged him as much when he was a baby, I don\u0027t know how he ever turned out so well. He and I eat at a little table set on the side porch, or sometimes under the trees, or--when it rains or is cold--in the best parlour. He just picks out the spot he wants to eat in and Carrie trots after him with the table. Then if it has been an awful nuisance, and she has had to carry the dishes very far, she finds a dollar under the sugar bowl. He is an awfully companionable sort of man, though you would never believe it to see him casually; he looks at first glance like a true Pendleton, but he isn\u0027t in the least. He is just as simple and unaffected and sweet as he can be--that seems a funny way to describe a man, but it\u0027s true. He\u0027s extremely nice with the farmers around here; he meets them in a sort of man-to-man fashion that disarms them immediately. They were very suspicious at first. They didn\u0027t care for his clothes! And I will say that his clothes are rather amazing. He wears knickerbockers and pleated jackets and white flannels and riding clothes with puffed trousers. Whenever he comes down in anything new, Mrs. Semple, beaming with pride, walks around and views him from every angle, and urges him to be careful where he sits down; she is so afraid he will pick up some dust. It bores him dreadfully. He\u0027s always saying to her: `Run along, Lizzie, and tend to your work. You can\u0027t boss me any longer. I\u0027ve grown up.\u0027 It\u0027s awfully funny to think of that great big, long-legged man (he\u0027s nearly as long-legged as you, Daddy) ever sitting in Mrs. Semple\u0027s lap and having his face washed. Particularly funny when you see her lap! She has two laps now, and three chins. But he says that once she was thin and wiry and spry and could run faster than he. Such a lot of adventures we\u0027re having! We\u0027ve explored the country for miles, and I\u0027ve learned to fish with funny little flies made of feathers. Also to shoot with a rifle and a revolver. Also to ride horseback--there\u0027s an astonishing amount of life in old Grove. We fed him on oats for three days, and he shied at a calf and almost ran away with me. Wednesday We climbed Sky Hill Monday afternoon. That\u0027s a mountain near here; not an awfully high mountain, perhaps--no snow on the summit--but at least you are pretty breathless when you reach the top. The lower slopes are covered with woods, but the top is just piled rocks and open moor. We stayed up for the sunset and built a fire and cooked our supper. Master Jervie did the cooking; he said he knew how better than me and he did, too, because he\u0027s used to camping. Then we came down by moonlight, and, when we reached the wood trail where it was dark, by the light of an electric bulb that he had in his pocket. It was such fun! He laughed and joked all the way and talked about interesting things. He\u0027s read all the books I\u0027ve ever read, and a lot of others besides. It\u0027s astonishing how many different things he knows. We went for a long tramp this morning and got caught in a storm. Our clothes were drenched before we reached home but our spirits not even damp. You should have seen Mrs. Semple\u0027s face when we dripped into her kitchen. `Oh, Master Jervie--Miss Judy! You are soaked through. Dear! Dear! What shall I do? That nice new coat is perfectly ruined.\u0027 She was awfully funny; you would have thought that we were ten years old, and she a distracted mother. I was afraid for a while that we weren\u0027t going to get any jam for tea. Saturday I started this letter ages ago, but I haven\u0027t had a second to finish it. Isn\u0027t this a nice thought from Stevenson? The world is so full of a number of things, I am sure we should all be as happy as kings. It\u0027s true, you know. The world is full of happiness, and plenty to go round, if you are only willing to take the kind that comes your way. The whole secret is in being PLIABLE. In the country, especially, there are such a lot of entertaining things. I can walk over everybody\u0027s land, and look at everybody\u0027s view, and dabble in everybody\u0027s brook; and enjoy it just as much as though I owned the land--and with no taxes to pay! It\u0027s Sunday night now, about eleven o\u0027clock, and I am supposed to be getting some beauty sleep, but I had black coffee for dinner, so--no beauty sleep for me! This morning, said Mrs. Semple to Mr. Pendleton, with a very determined accent: `We have to leave here at a quarter past ten in order to get to church by eleven.\u0027 `Very well, Lizzie,\u0027 said Master Jervie, `you have the buggy ready, and if I\u0027m not dressed, just go on without waiting.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll wait,\u0027 said she. `As you please,\u0027 said he, `only don\u0027t keep the horses standing too long.\u0027 Then while she was dressing, he told Carrie to pack up a lunch, and he told me to scramble into my walking clothes; and we slipped out the back way and went fishing. It discommoded the household dreadfully, because Lock Willow of a Sunday dines at two. But he ordered dinner at seven--he orders meals whenever he chooses; you would think the place were a restaurant-- and that kept Carrie and Amasai from going driving. But he said it was all the better because it wasn\u0027t proper for them to go driving without a chaperon; and anyway, he wanted the horses himself to take me driving. Did you ever hear anything so funny? And poor Mrs. Semple believes that people who go fishing on Sundays go afterwards to a sizzling hot hell! She is awfully troubled to think that she didn\u0027t train him better when he was small and helpless and she had the chance. Besides--she wished to show him off in church. Anyway, we had our fishing (he caught four little ones) and we cooked them on a camp-fire for lunch. They kept falling off our spiked sticks into the fire, so they tasted a little ashy, but we ate them. We got home at four and went driving at five and had dinner at seven, and at ten I was sent to bed and here I am, writing to you. I am getting a little sleepy, though. Good night. Here is a picture of the one fish I caught. Ship Ahoy, Cap\u0027n Long-Legs! Avast! Belay! Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum. Guess what I\u0027m reading? Our conversation these past two days has been nautical and piratical. Isn\u0027t Treasure Island fun? Did you ever read it, or wasn\u0027t it written when you were a boy? Stevenson only got thirty pounds for the serial rights--I don\u0027t believe it pays to be a great author. Maybe I\u0027ll be a school-teacher. Excuse me for filling my letters so full of Stevenson; my mind is very much engaged with him at present. He comprises Lock Willow\u0027s library. I\u0027ve been writing this letter for two weeks, and I think it\u0027s about long enough. Never say, Daddy, that I don\u0027t give details. I wish you were here, too; we\u0027d all have such a jolly time together. I like my different friends to know each other. I wanted to ask Mr. Pendleton if he knew you in New York--I should think he might; you must move in about the same exalted social circles, and you are both interested in reforms and things--but I couldn\u0027t, for I don\u0027t know your real name. It\u0027s the silliest thing I ever heard of, not to know your name. Mrs. Lippett warned me that you were eccentric. I should think so! Affectionately, Judy PS. On reading this over, I find that it isn\u0027t all Stevenson. There are one or two glancing references to Master Jervie.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59766.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
