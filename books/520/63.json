{"id":44729,"no":63,"title":"March Fifth","content":"Dear Mr. Trustee, Tomorrow is the first Wednesday in the month--a weary day for the John Grier Home. How relieved they\u0027ll be when five o\u0027clock comes and you pat them on the head and take yourselves off! Did you (individually) ever pat me on the head, Daddy? I don\u0027t believe so-- my memory seems to be concerned only with fat Trustees. Give the Home my love, please--my TRULY love. I have quite a feeling of tenderness for it as I look back through a haze of four years. When I first came to college I felt quite resentful because I\u0027d been robbed of the normal kind of childhood that the other girls had had; but now, I don\u0027t feel that way in the least. I regard it as a very unusual adventure. It gives me a sort of vantage point from which to stand aside and look at life. Emerging full grown, I get a perspective on the world, that other people who have been brought up in the thick of things entirely lack. I know lots of girls (Julia, for instance) who never know that they are happy. They are so accustomed to the feeling that their senses are deadened to it; but as for me--I am perfectly sure every moment of my life that I am happy. And I\u0027m going to keep on being, no matter what unpleasant things turn up. I\u0027m going to regard them (even toothaches) as interesting experiences, and be glad to know what they feel like. `Whatever sky\u0027s above me, I\u0027ve a heart for any fate.\u0027 However, Daddy, don\u0027t take this new affection for the J.G.H. too literally. If I have five children, like Rousseau, I shan\u0027t leave them on the steps of a foundling asylum in order to insure their being brought up simply. Give my kindest regards to Mrs. Lippett (that, I think, is truthful; love would be a little strong) and don\u0027t forget to tell her what a beautiful nature I\u0027ve developed. Affectionately, Judy","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59785.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
