{"id":44711,"no":45,"title":"10th September","content":"Dear Daddy, He has gone, and we are missing him! When you get accustomed to people or places or ways of living, and then have them snatched away, it does leave an awfully empty, gnawing sort of sensation. I\u0027m finding Mrs. Semple\u0027s conversation pretty unseasoned food. College opens in two weeks and I shall be glad to begin work again. I have worked quite a lot this summer though--six short stories and seven poems. Those I sent to the magazines all came back with the most courteous promptitude. But I don\u0027t mind. It\u0027s good practice. Master Jervie read them--he brought in the post, so I couldn\u0027t help his knowing--and he said they were DREADFUL. They showed that I didn\u0027t have the slightest idea of what I was talking about. (Master Jervie doesn\u0027t let politeness interfere with truth.) But the last one I did--just a little sketch laid in college-- he said wasn\u0027t bad; and he had it typewritten, and I sent it to a magazine. They\u0027ve had it two weeks; maybe they\u0027re thinking it over. You should see the sky! There\u0027s the queerest orange-coloured light over everything. We\u0027re going to have a storm. It commenced just that moment with tremendously big drops and all the shutters banging. I had to run to close the windows, while Carrie flew to the attic with an armful of milk pans to put under the places where the roof leaks and then, just as I was resuming my pen, I remembered that I\u0027d left a cushion and rug and hat and Matthew Arnold\u0027s poems under a tree in the orchard, so I dashed out to get them, all quite soaked. The red cover of the poems had run into the inside; Dover Beach in the future will be washed by pink waves. A storm is awfully disturbing in the country. You are always having to think of so many things that are out of doors and getting spoiled. Thursday Daddy! Daddy! What do you think? The postman has just come with two letters. 1st. My story is accepted. $50. ALORS! I\u0027m an AUTHOR. 2nd. A letter from the college secretary. I\u0027m to have a scholarship for two years that will cover board and tuition. It was founded for `marked proficiency in English with general excellency in other lines.\u0027 And I\u0027ve won it! I applied for it before I left, but I didn\u0027t have an idea I\u0027d get it, on account of my Freshman bad work in maths and Latin. But it seems I\u0027ve made it up. I am awfully glad, Daddy, because now I won\u0027t be such a burden to you. The monthly allowance will be all I\u0027ll need, and maybe I can earn that with writing or tutoring or something. I\u0027m LONGING to go back and begin work. Yours ever, Jerusha Abbott, Author of When the Sophomores Won the Game.
