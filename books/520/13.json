{"id":44679,"no":13,"title":"Chapter","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, This is an extra letter in the middle of the month because I\u0027m rather lonely tonight. It\u0027s awfully stormy. All the lights are out on the campus, but I drank black coffee and I can\u0027t go to sleep. I had a supper party this evening consisting of Sallie and Julia and Leonora Fenton--and sardines and toasted muffins and salad and fudge and coffee. Julia said she\u0027d had a good time, but Sallie stayed to help wash the dishes. I might, very usefully, put some time on Latin tonight but, there\u0027s no doubt about it, I\u0027m a very languid Latin scholar. We\u0027ve finished Livy and De Senectute and are now engaged with De Amicitia (pronounced Damn Icitia). Should you mind, just for a little while, pretending you are my grandmother? Sallie has one and Julia and Leonora each two, and they were all comparing them tonight. I can\u0027t think of anything I\u0027d rather have; it\u0027s such a respectable relationship. So, if you really don\u0027t object--When I went into town yesterday, I saw the sweetest cap of Cluny lace trimmed with lavender ribbon. I am going to make you a present of it on your eighty-third birthday. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! That\u0027s the clock in the chapel tower striking twelve. I believe I am sleepy after all. Good night, Granny. I love you dearly.
