{"id":44679,"no":13,"title":"Chapter","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n This is an extra letter in the middle of the month because I\u0027m \n rather lonely tonight. It\u0027s awfully stormy. All the lights are \n out on the campus, but I drank black coffee and I can\u0027t go to sleep. \n \n I had a supper party this evening consisting of Sallie and Julia \n and Leonora Fenton--and sardines and toasted muffins and salad \n and fudge and coffee. Julia said she\u0027d had a good time, but Sallie \n stayed to help wash the dishes. \n \n \n I might, very usefully, put some time on Latin tonight but, \n there\u0027s no doubt about it, I\u0027m a very languid Latin scholar. \n We\u0027ve finished Livy and De Senectute and are now engaged with De \n Amicitia (pronounced Damn Icitia). \n \n Should you mind, just for a little while, pretending you are \n my grandmother? Sallie has one and Julia and Leonora each two, \n and they were all comparing them tonight. I can\u0027t think of \n anything I\u0027d rather have; it\u0027s such a respectable relationship. \n So, if you really don\u0027t object--When I went into town yesterday, \n I saw the sweetest cap of Cluny lace trimmed with lavender ribbon. \n I am going to make you a present of it on your eighty-third birthday. \n \n ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! \n \n That\u0027s the clock in the chapel tower striking twelve. I believe \n I am sleepy after all. \n Good night, Granny. \n I love you dearly. \n Judy \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59735.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
