{"id":44713,"no":47,"title":"30th September","content":"Dear Daddy, \\n\\n \\n\\n Are you still harping on that scholarship? I never knew a man \\n\\n so obstinate, and stubborn and unreasonable, and tenacious, \\n\\n and bull-doggish, and unable-to-see-other-people\u0027s-point-of-view, \\n\\n as you. \\n\\n \\n\\n You prefer that I should not be accepting favours from strangers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Strangers!--And what are you, pray? \\n\\n \\n\\n Is there anyone in the world that I know less? I shouldn\u0027t recognize \\n\\n you if I met you in the street. Now, you see, if you had been a sane, \\n\\n sensible person and had written nice, cheering fatherly letters to your \\n\\n little Judy, and had come occasionally and patted her on the head, \\n\\n and had said you were glad she was such a good girl--Then, perhaps, \\n\\n she wouldn\u0027t have flouted you in your old age, but would have obeyed \\n\\n your slightest wish like the dutiful daughter she was meant to be. \\n\\n \\n\\n Strangers indeed! You live in a glass house, Mr. Smith. \\n\\n \\n\\n And besides, this isn\u0027t a favour; it\u0027s like a prize--I earned it by \\n\\n hard work. If nobody had been good enough in English, the committee \\n\\n wouldn\u0027t have awarded the scholarship; some years they don\u0027t. Also-- \\n\\n But what\u0027s the use of arguing with a man? You belong, Mr. Smith, \\n\\n to a sex devoid of a sense of logic. To bring a man into line, \\n\\n there are just two methods: one must either coax or be disagreeable. \\n\\n I scorn to coax men for what I wish. Therefore, I must be disagreeable. \\n\\n \\n\\n I refuse, sir, to give up the scholarship; and if you make any \\n\\n more fuss, I won\u0027t accept the monthly allowance either, but will \\n\\n wear myself into a nervous wreck tutoring stupid Freshmen. \\n\\n \\n\\n That is my ultimatum! \\n\\n \\n\\n And listen--I have a further thought. Since you are so afraid that by \\n\\n taking this scholarship I am depriving someone else of an education, \\n\\n I know a way out. You can apply the money that you would have spent \\n\\n for me towards educating some other little girl from the John Grier Home. \\n\\n Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s a nice idea? Only, Daddy, EDUCATE the new \\n\\n girl as much as you choose, but please don\u0027t LIKE her any better than me. \\n\\n \\n\\n I trust that your secretary won\u0027t be hurt because I pay so little \\n\\n attention to the suggestions offered in his letter, but I can\u0027t \\n\\n help it if he is. He\u0027s a spoiled child, Daddy. I\u0027ve meekly given \\n\\n in to his whims heretofore, but this time I intend to be FIRM. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yours, \\n\\n With a mind, \\n\\n Completely and Irrevocably and \\n\\n World-without-End Made-up, \\n\\n \\n\\n Jerusha Abbott \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59769.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
