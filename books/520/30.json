{"id":44696,"no":30,"title":"6.30, Saturday","content":"Dear Daddy, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n We started to walk to town today, but mercy! how it poured. \\n\\n I like winter to be winter with snow instead of rain. \\n\\n \\n\\n Julia\u0027s desirable uncle called again this afternoon--and brought \\n\\n a five-pound box of chocolates. There are advantages, you see, \\n\\n about rooming with Julia. \\n\\n \\n\\n Our innocent prattle appeared to amuse him and he waited for a later \\n\\n train in order to take tea in the study. We had an awful lot of \\n\\n trouble getting permission. It\u0027s hard enough entertaining fathers \\n\\n and grandfathers, but uncles are a step worse; and as for brothers \\n\\n and cousins, they are next to impossible. Julia had to swear \\n\\n that he was her uncle before a notary public and then have the \\n\\n county clerk\u0027s certificate attached. (Don\u0027t I know a lot of law?) \\n\\n And even then I doubt if we could have had our tea if the Dean \\n\\n had chanced to see how youngish and good-looking Uncle Jervis is. \\n\\n \\n\\n Anyway, we had it, with brown bread Swiss cheese sandwiches. \\n\\n He helped make them and then ate four. I told him that I had \\n\\n spent last summer at Lock Willow, and we had a beautiful gossipy \\n\\n time about the Semples, and the horses and cows and chickens. \\n\\n All the horses that he used to know are dead, except Grover, \\n\\n who was a baby colt at the time of his last visit--and poor Grove \\n\\n now is so old he can just limp about the pasture. \\n\\n \\n\\n He asked if they still kept doughnuts in a yellow crock with a blue \\n\\n plate over it on the bottom shelf of the pantry--and they do! \\n\\n He wanted to know if there was still a woodchuck\u0027s hole under the pile \\n\\n of rocks in the night pasture--and there is! Amasai caught a big, \\n\\n fat, grey one there this summer, the twenty-fifth great-grandson \\n\\n of the one Master Jervis caught when he was a little boy. \\n\\n \\n\\n I called him `Master Jervie\u0027 to his face, but he didn\u0027t appear \\n\\n to be insulted. Julia says she has never seen him so amiable; \\n\\n he\u0027s usually pretty unapproachable. But Julia hasn\u0027t a bit of tact; \\n\\n and men, I find, require a great deal. They purr if you rub them the \\n\\n right way and spit if you don\u0027t. (That isn\u0027t a very elegant metaphor. \\n\\n I mean it figuratively.) \\n\\n \\n\\n We\u0027re reading Marie Bashkirtseff\u0027s journal. Isn\u0027t it amazing? \\n\\n Listen to this: `Last night I was seized by a fit of despair \\n\\n that found utterance in moans, and that finally drove me to throw \\n\\n the dining-room clock into the sea.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n It makes me almost hope I\u0027m not a genius; they must be very wearing \\n\\n to have about--and awfully destructive to the furniture. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mercy! how it keeps Pouring. We shall have to swim to chapel tonight. \\n\\n Yours ever, \\n\\n Judy \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59752.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
