{"id":44693,"no":27,"title":"17th October","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n Supposing the swimming tank in the gymnasium were filled full \n of lemon jelly, could a person trying to swim manage to keep \n on top or would he sink? \n \n We were having lemon jelly for dessert when the question came up. \n We discussed it heatedly for half an hour and it\u0027s still unsettled. \n Sallie thinks that she could swim in it, but I am perfectly sure \n that the best swimmer in the world would sink. Wouldn\u0027t it be funny \n to be drowned in lemon jelly? \n \n Two other problems are engaging the attention of our table. \n \n 1st. What shape are the rooms in an octagon house? \n Some of the girls insist that they\u0027re square; \n but I think they\u0027d have to be shaped like a piece of pie. Don\u0027t you? \n \n 2nd. Suppose there were a great big hollow sphere made of \n looking-glass and you were sitting inside. Where would it stop \n reflecting your face and begin reflecting your back? The more \n one thinks about this problem, the more puzzling it becomes. \n You can see with what deep philosophical reflection we engage our leisure! \n \n Did I ever tell you about the election? It happened three weeks ago, \n but so fast do we live, that three weeks is ancient history. \n Sallie was elected, and we had a torchlight parade with \n transparencies saying, `McBride for Ever,\u0027 and a band consisting \n of fourteen pieces (three mouth organs and eleven combs). \n \n We\u0027re very important persons now in `258.\u0027 Julia and I come in \n for a great deal of reflected glory. It\u0027s quite a social strain \n to be living in the same house with a president. \n \n Bonne nuit, cher Daddy. \n Acceptez mez compliments, \n Tres respectueux, \n je suis, \n Votre Judy \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59749.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
