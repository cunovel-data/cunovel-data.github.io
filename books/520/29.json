{"id":44695,"no":29,"title":"31st December","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n I meant to write to you before and thank you for your Christmas cheque, \\n\\n but life in the McBride household is very absorbing, and I don\u0027t \\n\\n seem able to find two consecutive minutes to spend at a desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n I bought a new gown--one that I didn\u0027t need, but just wanted. \\n\\n My Christmas present this year is from Daddy-Long-Legs; my family \\n\\n just sent love. \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027ve been having the most beautiful vacation visiting Sallie. \\n\\n She lives in a big old-fashioned brick house with white trimmings set \\n\\n back from the street--exactly the kind of house that I used to look \\n\\n at so curiously when I was in the John Grier Home, and wonder what it \\n\\n could be like inside. I never expected to see with my own eyes-- \\n\\n but here I am! Everything is so comfortable and restful and homelike; \\n\\n I walk from room to room and drink in the furnishings. \\n\\n \\n\\n It is the most perfect house for children to be brought up in; \\n\\n with shadowy nooks for hide and seek, and open fire places for pop-corn, \\n\\n and an attic to romp in on rainy days and slippery banisters with a \\n\\n comfortable flat knob at the bottom, and a great big sunny kitchen, \\n\\n and a nice, fat, sunny cook who has lived in the family thirteen years \\n\\n and always saves out a piece of dough for the children to bake. \\n\\n Just the sight of such a house makes you want to be a child all \\n\\n over again. \\n\\n \\n\\n And as for families! I never dreamed they could be so nice. \\n\\n Sallie has a father and mother and grandmother, and the sweetest \\n\\n three-year-old baby sister all over curls, and a medium-sized brother \\n\\n who always forgets to wipe his feet, and a big, good-looking brother \\n\\n named Jimmie, who is a junior at Princeton. \\n\\n \\n\\n We have the jolliest times at the table--everybody laughs and jokes \\n\\n and talks at once, and we don\u0027t have to say grace beforehand. \\n\\n It\u0027s a relief not having to thank Somebody for every mouthful you eat. \\n\\n (I dare say I\u0027m blasphemous; but you\u0027d be, too, if you\u0027d offered as \\n\\n much obligatory thanks as I have.) \\n\\n \\n\\n Such a lot of things we\u0027ve done--I can\u0027t begin to tell you about them. \\n\\n Mr. McBride owns a factory and Christmas eve he had a tree for \\n\\n the employees\u0027 children. It was in the long packing-room which was \\n\\n decorated with evergreens and holly. Jimmie McBride was dressed \\n\\n as Santa Claus and Sallie and I helped him distribute the presents. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dear me, Daddy, but it was a funny sensation! I felt as benevolent \\n\\n as a Trustee of the John Grier home. I kissed one sweet, \\n\\n sticky little boy--but I don\u0027t think I patted any of them on the head! \\n\\n \\n\\n And two days after Christmas, they gave a dance at their own house \\n\\n for ME. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the first really true ball I ever attended--college doesn\u0027t \\n\\n count where we dance with girls. I had a new white evening gown \\n\\n (your Christmas present--many thanks) and long white gloves \\n\\n and white satin slippers. The only drawback to my perfect, \\n\\n utter, absolute happiness was the fact that Mrs. Lippett \\n\\n couldn\u0027t see me leading the cotillion with Jimmie McBride. \\n\\n Tell her about it, please, the next time you visit the J. G. H. \\n\\n Yours ever, \\n\\n Judy Abbott \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. Would you be terribly displeased, Daddy, if I didn\u0027t turn \\n\\n out to be a Great Author after all, but just a Plain Girl? \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59751.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
