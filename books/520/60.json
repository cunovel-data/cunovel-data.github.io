{"id":44726,"no":60,"title":"14th December","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, I dreamed the funniest dream last night. I thought I went into a book store and the clerk brought me a new book named The Life and Letters of Judy Abbott. I could see it perfectly plainly-- red cloth binding with a picture of the John Grier Home on the cover, and my portrait for a frontispiece with, `Very truly yours, Judy Abbott,\u0027 written below. But just as I was turning to the end to read the inscription on my tombstone, I woke up. It was very annoying! I almost found out whom I\u0027m going to marry and when I\u0027m going to die. Don\u0027t you think it would be interesting if you really could read the story of your life--written perfectly truthfully by an omniscient author? And suppose you could only read it on this condition: that you would never forget it, but would have to go through life knowing ahead of time exactly how everything you did would turn out, and foreseeing to the exact hour the time when you would die. How many people do you suppose would have the courage to read it then? or how many could suppress their curiosity sufficiently to escape from reading it, even at the price of having to live without hope and without surprises? Life is monotonous enough at best; you have to eat and sleep about so often. But imagine how DEADLY monotonous it would be if nothing unexpected could happen between meals. Mercy! Daddy, there\u0027s a blot, but I\u0027m on the third page and I can\u0027t begin a new sheet. I\u0027m going on with biology again this year--very interesting subject; we\u0027re studying the alimentary system at present. You should see how sweet a cross-section of the duodenum of a cat is under the microscope. Also we\u0027ve arrived at philosophy--interesting but evanescent. I prefer biology where you can pin the subject under discussion to a board. There\u0027s another! And another! This pen is weeping copiously. Please excuse its tears. Do you believe in free will? I do--unreservedly. I don\u0027t agree at all with the philosophers who think that every action is the absolutely inevitable and automatic resultant of an aggregation of remote causes. That\u0027s the most immoral doctrine I ever heard-- nobody would be to blame for anything. If a man believed in fatalism, he would naturally just sit down and say, `The Lord\u0027s will be done,\u0027 and continue to sit until he fell over dead. I believe absolutely in my own free will and my own power to accomplish-- and that is the belief that moves mountains. You watch me become a great author! I have four chapters of my new book finished and five more drafted. This is a very abstruse letter--does your head ache, Daddy? I think we\u0027ll stop now and make some fudge. I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t send you a piece; it will be unusually good, for we\u0027re going to make it with real cream and three butter balls. Yours affectionately, Judy PS. We\u0027re having fancy dancing in gymnasium class. You can see by the accompanying picture how much we look like a real ballet. The one at the end accomplishing a graceful pirouette is me--I mean I.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59782.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
