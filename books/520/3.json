{"id":44669,"no":3,"title":"10th October","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Did you ever hear of Michael Angelo? \\n\\n \\n\\n He was a famous artist who lived in Italy in the Middle Ages. \\n\\n Everybody in English Literature seemed to know about him, and the \\n\\n whole class laughed because I thought he was an archangel. He sounds \\n\\n like an archangel, doesn\u0027t he? The trouble with college is that you \\n\\n are expected to know such a lot of things you\u0027ve never learned. \\n\\n It\u0027s very embarrassing at times. But now, when the girls talk about \\n\\n things that I never heard of, I just keep still and look them up \\n\\n in the encyclopedia. \\n\\n \\n\\n I made an awful mistake the first day. Somebody mentioned \\n\\n Maurice Maeterlinck, and I asked if she was a Freshman. \\n\\n That joke has gone all over college. But anyway, I\u0027m just \\n\\n as bright in class as any of the others--and brighter than some of them! \\n\\n \\n\\n Do you care to know how I\u0027ve furnished my room? It\u0027s a symphony \\n\\n in brown and yellow. The wall was tinted buff, and I\u0027ve bought \\n\\n yellow denim curtains and cushions and a mahogany desk (second hand \\n\\n for three dollars) and a rattan chair and a brown rug with an ink \\n\\n spot in the middle. I stand the chair over the spot. \\n\\n \\n\\n The windows are up high; you can\u0027t look out from an ordinary seat. \\n\\n But I unscrewed the looking-glass from the back of the bureau, \\n\\n upholstered the top and moved it up against the window. It\u0027s just \\n\\n the right height for a window seat. You pull out the drawers like \\n\\n steps and walk up. Very comfortable! \\n\\n \\n\\n Sallie McBride helped me choose the things at the Senior auction. \\n\\n She has lived in a house all her life and knows about furnishing. \\n\\n You can\u0027t imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real \\n\\n five-dollar bill and get some change--when you\u0027ve never had more than \\n\\n a few cents in your life. I assure you, Daddy dear, I do appreciate \\n\\n that allowance. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sallie is the most entertaining person in the world--and Julia \\n\\n Rutledge Pendleton the least so. It\u0027s queer what a mixture \\n\\n the registrar can make in the matter of room-mates. Sallie thinks \\n\\n everything is funny--even flunking--and Julia is bored at everything. \\n\\n She never makes the slightest effort to be amiable. She believes \\n\\n that if you are a Pendleton, that fact alone admits you to heaven \\n\\n without any further examination. Julia and I were born to be enemies. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now I suppose you\u0027ve been waiting very impatiently to hear \\n\\n what I am learning? \\n\\n \\n\\n I. Latin: Second Punic war. Hannibal and his forces pitched camp \\n\\n at Lake Trasimenus last night. They prepared an ambuscade for \\n\\n the Romans, and a battle took place at the fourth watch this morning. \\n\\n Romans in retreat. \\n\\n \\n\\n II. French: 24 pages of the Three Musketeers and third conjugation, \\n\\n irregular verbs. \\n\\n \\n\\n III. Geometry: Finished cylinders; now doing cones. \\n\\n \\n\\n IV. English: Studying exposition. My style improves daily \\n\\n in clearness and brevity. \\n\\n \\n\\n V. Physiology: Reached the digestive system. Bile and the pancreas \\n\\n next time. Yours, on the way to being educated, \\n\\n Jerusha Abbott \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. I hope you never touch alcohol, Daddy? It does dreadful \\n\\n things to your liver. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59725.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
