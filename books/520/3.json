{"id":44669,"no":3,"title":"10th October","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, Did you ever hear of Michael Angelo? He was a famous artist who lived in Italy in the Middle Ages. Everybody in English Literature seemed to know about him, and the whole class laughed because I thought he was an archangel. He sounds like an archangel, doesn\u0027t he? The trouble with college is that you are expected to know such a lot of things you\u0027ve never learned. It\u0027s very embarrassing at times. But now, when the girls talk about things that I never heard of, I just keep still and look them up in the encyclopedia. I made an awful mistake the first day. Somebody mentioned Maurice Maeterlinck, and I asked if she was a Freshman. That joke has gone all over college. But anyway, I\u0027m just as bright in class as any of the others--and brighter than some of them! Do you care to know how I\u0027ve furnished my room? It\u0027s a symphony in brown and yellow. The wall was tinted buff, and I\u0027ve bought yellow denim curtains and cushions and a mahogany desk (second hand for three dollars) and a rattan chair and a brown rug with an ink spot in the middle. I stand the chair over the spot. The windows are up high; you can\u0027t look out from an ordinary seat. But I unscrewed the looking-glass from the back of the bureau, upholstered the top and moved it up against the window. It\u0027s just the right height for a window seat. You pull out the drawers like steps and walk up. Very comfortable! Sallie McBride helped me choose the things at the Senior auction. She has lived in a house all her life and knows about furnishing. You can\u0027t imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real five-dollar bill and get some change--when you\u0027ve never had more than a few cents in your life. I assure you, Daddy dear, I do appreciate that allowance. Sallie is the most entertaining person in the world--and Julia Rutledge Pendleton the least so. It\u0027s queer what a mixture the registrar can make in the matter of room-mates. Sallie thinks everything is funny--even flunking--and Julia is bored at everything. She never makes the slightest effort to be amiable. She believes that if you are a Pendleton, that fact alone admits you to heaven without any further examination. Julia and I were born to be enemies. And now I suppose you\u0027ve been waiting very impatiently to hear what I am learning? I. Latin: Second Punic war. Hannibal and his forces pitched camp at Lake Trasimenus last night. They prepared an ambuscade for the Romans, and a battle took place at the fourth watch this morning. Romans in retreat. II. French: 24 pages of the Three Musketeers and third conjugation, irregular verbs. III. Geometry: Finished cylinders; now doing cones. IV. English: Studying exposition. My style improves daily in clearness and brevity. V. Physiology: Reached the digestive system. Bile and the pancreas next time. Yours, on the way to being educated, Jerusha Abbott PS. I hope you never touch alcohol, Daddy? It does dreadful things to your liver.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59725.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
