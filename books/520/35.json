{"id":44701,"no":35,"title":"7th April","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n Mercy! Isn\u0027t New York big? Worcester is nothing to it. Do you \n mean to tell me that you actually live in all that confusion? \n I don\u0027t believe that I shall recover for months from the bewildering \n effect of two days of it. I can\u0027t begin to tell you all the amazing \n things I\u0027ve seen; I suppose you know, though, since you live \n there yourself. \n \n But aren\u0027t the streets entertaining? And the people? And the shops? \n I never saw such lovely things as there are in the windows. \n It makes you want to devote your life to wearing clothes. \n \n Sallie and Julia and I went shopping together Saturday morning. \n Julia went into the very most gorgeous place I ever saw, white and \n gold walls and blue carpets and blue silk curtains and gilt chairs. \n A perfectly beautiful lady with yellow hair and a long black silk \n trailing gown came to meet us with a welcoming smile. I thought we \n were paying a social call, and started to shake hands, but it seems \n we were only buying hats--at least Julia was. She sat down in front \n of a mirror and tried on a dozen, each lovelier than the last, \n and bought the two loveliest of all. \n \n I can\u0027t imagine any joy in life greater than sitting down in front \n of a mirror and buying any hat you choose without having first \n to consider the price! There\u0027s no doubt about it, Daddy; New York \n would rapidly undermine this fine stoical character which the John \n Grier Home so patiently built up. \n \n And after we\u0027d finished our shopping, we met Master Jervie \n at Sherry\u0027s. I suppose you\u0027ve been in Sherry\u0027s? Picture that, \n then picture the dining-room of the John Grier Home with its \n oilcloth-covered tables, and white crockery that you CAN\u0027T break, \n and wooden-handled knives and forks; and fancy the way I felt! \n \n I ate my fish with the wrong fork, but the waiter very kindly gave \n me another so that nobody noticed. \n \n And after luncheon we went to the theatre--it was dazzling, \n marvellous, unbelievable--I dream about it every night. \n \n Isn\u0027t Shakespeare wonderful? \n \n Hamlet is so much better on the stage than when we analyze it in class; \n I appreciated it before, but now, clear me! \n \n I think, if you don\u0027t mind, that I\u0027d rather be an actress than \n a writer. Wouldn\u0027t you like me to leave college and go into a \n dramatic school? And then I\u0027ll send you a box for all my performances, \n and smile at you across the footlights. Only wear a red rose \n in your buttonhole, please, so I\u0027ll surely smile at the right man. \n It would be an awfully embarrassing mistake if I picked out the wrong one. \n \n We came back Saturday night and had our dinner in the train, \n at little tables with pink lamps and negro waiters. I never heard \n of meals being served in trains before, and I inadvertently said so. \n \n `Where on earth were you brought up?\u0027 said Julia to me. \n \n `In a village,\u0027 said I meekly, to Julia. \n \n `But didn\u0027t you ever travel?\u0027 said she to me. \n \n `Not till I came to college, and then it was only a hundred \n and sixty miles and we didn\u0027t eat,\u0027 said I to her. \n \n She\u0027s getting quite interested in me, because I say such funny things. \n I try hard not to, but they do pop out when I\u0027m surprised-- \n and I\u0027m surprised most of the time. It\u0027s a dizzying experience, \n Daddy, to pass eighteen years in the John Grier Home, and then \n suddenly to be plunged into the WORLD. \n \n But I\u0027m getting acclimated. I don\u0027t make such awful mistakes as I did; \n and I don\u0027t feel uncomfortable any more with the other girls. I used \n to squirm whenever people looked at me. I felt as though they saw \n right through my sham new clothes to the checked ginghams underneath. \n But I\u0027m not letting the ginghams bother me any more. Sufficient unto \n yesterday is the evil thereof. \n \n I forgot to tell you about our flowers. Master Jervie gave us each \n a big bunch of violets and lilies-of-the-valley. Wasn\u0027t that sweet \n of him? I never used to care much for men--judging by Trustees-- \n but I\u0027m changing my mind. \n \n Eleven pages--this is a letter! Have courage. I\u0027m going to stop. \n Yours always, \n Judy \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59757.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
