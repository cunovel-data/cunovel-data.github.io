{"id":44692,"no":26,"title":"Chapter","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Behold me--a Sophomore! I came up last Friday, sorry to leave \\n\\n Lock Willow, but glad to see the campus again. It is a pleasant \\n\\n sensation to come back to something familiar. I am beginning to feel \\n\\n at home in college, and in command of the situation; I am beginning, \\n\\n in fact, to feel at home in the world--as though I really belonged \\n\\n to it and had not just crept in on sufferance. \\n\\n \\n\\n I don\u0027t suppose you understand in the least what I am trying to say. \\n\\n A person important enough to be a Trustee can\u0027t appreciate the \\n\\n feelings of a person unimportant enough to be a foundling. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now, Daddy, listen to this. Whom do you think I am rooming with? \\n\\n Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton. It\u0027s the truth. \\n\\n We have a study and three little bedrooms--VOILA! \\n\\n \\n\\n Sallie and I decided last spring that we should like to room together, \\n\\n and Julia made up her mind to stay with Sallie--why, I can\u0027t imagine, \\n\\n for they are not a bit alike; but the Pendletons are naturally \\n\\n conservative and inimical (fine word!) to change. Anyway, here we are. \\n\\n Think of Jerusha Abbott, late of the John Grier Home for Orphans, \\n\\n rooming with a Pendleton. This is a democratic country. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sallie is running for class president, and unless all signs fail, \\n\\n she is going to be elected. Such an atmosphere of intrigue you should \\n\\n see what politicians we are! Oh, I tell you, Daddy, when we women get \\n\\n our rights, you men will have to look alive in order to keep yours. \\n\\n Election comes next Saturday, and we\u0027re going to have a torchlight \\n\\n procession in the evening, no matter who wins. \\n\\n \\n\\n I am beginning chemistry, a most unusual study. I\u0027ve never seen \\n\\n anything like it before. Molecules and Atoms are the material employed, \\n\\n but I\u0027ll be in a position to discuss them more definitely next month. \\n\\n \\n\\n I am also taking argumentation and logic. \\n\\n \\n\\n Also history of the whole world. \\n\\n \\n\\n Also plays of William Shakespeare. \\n\\n \\n\\n Also French. \\n\\n \\n\\n If this keeps up many years longer, I shall become quite intelligent. \\n\\n \\n\\n I should rather have elected economics than French, but I \\n\\n didn\u0027t dare, because I was afraid that unless I re-elected \\n\\n French, the Professor would not let me pass--as it was, \\n\\n I just managed to squeeze through the June examination. \\n\\n But I will say that my high-school preparation was not very adequate. \\n\\n \\n\\n There\u0027s one girl in the class who chatters away in French as fast \\n\\n as she does in English. She went abroad with her parents when she \\n\\n was a child, and spent three years in a convent school. You can \\n\\n imagine how bright she is compared with the rest of us--irregular verbs \\n\\n are mere playthings. I wish my parents had chucked me into a French \\n\\n convent when I was little instead of a foundling asylum. Oh no, \\n\\n I don\u0027t either! Because then maybe I should never have known you. \\n\\n I\u0027d rather know you than French. \\n\\n \\n\\n Goodbye, Daddy. I must call on Harriet Martin now, \\n\\n and, having discussed the chemical situation, \\n\\n casually drop a few thoughts on the subject of our next president. \\n\\n Yours in politics, \\n\\n J. Abbott \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59748.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
