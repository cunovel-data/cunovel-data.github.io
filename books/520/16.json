Please forget about that dreadful letter I sent you last week-- I was feeling terribly lonely and miserable and sore-throaty the night I wrote. I didn\u0027t know it, but I was just sickening for tonsillitis and grippe and lots of things mixed. I\u0027m in the infirmary now, and have been here for six days; this is the first time they would let me sit up and have a pen and paper. The head nurse is very bossy. But I\u0027ve been thinking about it all the time and I shan\u0027t get well until you forgive me. Here is a picture of the way I look, with a bandage tied around my head in rabbit\u0027s ears. Doesn\u0027t that arouse your sympathy? I am having sublingual gland swelling. And I\u0027ve been studying physiology all the year without ever hearing of sublingual glands. How futile a thing is education! I can\u0027t write any more; I get rather shaky when I sit up too long. Please forgive me for being impertinent and ungrateful. I was badly brought up. Yours with love, Judy Abbott","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59738.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
