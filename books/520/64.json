{"id":44730,"no":64,"title":"LOCK WILLOW, 4th April","content":"Dear Daddy, Do you observe the postmark? Sallie and I are embellishing Lock Willow with our presence during the Easter Vacation. We decided that the best thing we could do with our ten days was to come where it is quiet. Our nerves had got to the point where they wouldn\u0027t stand another meal in Fergussen. Dining in a room with four hundred girls is an ordeal when you are tired. There is so much noise that you can\u0027t hear the girls across the table speak unless they make their hands into a megaphone and shout. That is the truth. We are tramping over the hills and reading and writing, and having a nice, restful time. We climbed to the top of `Sky Hill\u0027 this morning where Master Jervie and I once cooked supper-- it doesn\u0027t seem possible that it was nearly two years ago. I could still see the place where the smoke of our fire blackened the rock. It is funny how certain places get connected with certain people, and you never go back without thinking of them. I was quite lonely without him--for two minutes. What do you think is my latest activity, Daddy? You will begin to believe that I am incorrigible--I am writing a book. I started it three weeks ago and am eating it up in chunks. I\u0027ve caught the secret. Master Jervie and that editor man were right; you are most convincing when you write about the things you know. And this time it is about something that I do know--exhaustively. Guess where it\u0027s laid? In the John Grier Home! And it\u0027s good, Daddy, I actually believe it is--just about the tiny little things that happened every day. I\u0027m a realist now. I\u0027ve abandoned romanticism; I shall go back to it later though, when my own adventurous future begins. This new book is going to get itself finished--and published! You see if it doesn\u0027t. If you just want a thing hard enough and keep on trying, you do get it in the end. I\u0027ve been trying for four years to get a letter from you--and I haven\u0027t given up hope yet. Goodbye, Daddy dear, (I like to call you Daddy dear; it\u0027s so alliterative.) Affectionately, Judy PS. I forgot to tell you the farm news, but it\u0027s very distressing. Skip this postscript if you don\u0027t want your sensibilities all wrought up. Poor old Grove is dead. He got so that he couldn\u0027t chew and they had to shoot him. Nine chickens were killed by a weasel or a skunk or a rat last week. One of the cows is sick, and we had to have the veterinary surgeon out from Bonnyrigg Four Corners. Amasai stayed up all night to give her linseed oil and whisky. But we have an awful suspicion that the poor sick cow got nothing but linseed oil. Sentimental Tommy (the tortoise-shell cat) has disappeared; we are afraid he has been caught in a trap. There are lots of troubles in the world!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59786.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
