{"id":44712,"no":46,"title":"26th September","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Back at college again and an upper classman. Our study is better \\n\\n than ever this year--faces the South with two huge windows and oh! \\n\\n so furnished. Julia, with an unlimited allowance, arrived two days \\n\\n early and was attacked with a fever for settling. \\n\\n \\n\\n We have new wall paper and oriental rugs and mahogany chairs-- \\n\\n not painted mahogany which made us sufficiently happy last year, \\n\\n but real. It\u0027s very gorgeous, but I don\u0027t feel as though I belonged \\n\\n in it; I\u0027m nervous all the time for fear I\u0027ll get an ink spot in the \\n\\n wrong place. \\n\\n \\n\\n And, Daddy, I found your letter waiting for me--pardon--I mean \\n\\n your secretary\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n Will you kindly convey to me a comprehensible reason why I should \\n\\n not accept that scholarship? I don\u0027t understand your objection \\n\\n in the least. But anyway, it won\u0027t do the slightest good for you \\n\\n to object, for I\u0027ve already accepted it and I am not going to change! \\n\\n That sounds a little impertinent, but I don\u0027t mean it so. \\n\\n \\n\\n I suppose you feel that when you set out to educate me, you\u0027d like to \\n\\n finish the work, and put a neat period, in the shape of a diploma, \\n\\n at the end. \\n\\n \\n\\n But look at it just a second from my point of view. I shall owe my \\n\\n education to you just as much as though I let you pay for the whole of it, \\n\\n but I won\u0027t be quite so much indebted. I know that you don\u0027t want me \\n\\n to return the money, but nevertheless, I am going to want to do it, \\n\\n if I possibly can; and winning this scholarship makes it so much easier. \\n\\n I was expecting to spend the rest of my life in paying my debts, \\n\\n but now I shall only have to spend one-half of the rest of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n I hope you understand my position and won\u0027t be cross. The allowance \\n\\n I shall still most gratefully accept. It requires an allowance \\n\\n to live up to Julia and her furniture! I wish that she had been \\n\\n reared to simpler tastes, or else that she were not my room-mate. \\n\\n \\n\\n This isn\u0027t much of a letter; I meant to have written a lot--but I\u0027ve \\n\\n been hemming four window curtains and three portieres (I\u0027m glad you \\n\\n can\u0027t see the length of the stitches), and polishing a brass desk \\n\\n set with tooth powder (very uphill work), and sawing off picture \\n\\n wire with manicure scissors, and unpacking four boxes of books, \\n\\n and putting away two trunkfuls of clothes (it doesn\u0027t seem believable \\n\\n that Jerusha Abbott owns two trunks full of clothes, but she does!) \\n\\n and welcoming back fifty dear friends in between. \\n\\n \\n\\n Opening day is a joyous occasion! \\n\\n \\n\\n Good night, Daddy dear, and don\u0027t be annoyed because your \\n\\n chick is wanting to scratch for herself. She\u0027s growing up \\n\\n into an awfully energetic little hen--with a very determined \\n\\n cluck and lots of beautiful feathers (all due to you). \\n\\n Affectionately, \\n\\n Judy \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59768.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
