{"id":44678,"no":12,"title":"Sunday","content":"Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n I have some awful, awful, awful news to tell you, but I won\u0027t begin \n with it; I\u0027ll try to get you in a good humour first. \n \n Jerusha Abbott has commenced to be an author. A poem entitled, \n `From my Tower\u0027, appears in the February Monthly--on the first page, \n which is a very great honour for a Freshman. My English instructor \n stopped me on the way out from chapel last night, and said it was \n a charming piece of work except for the sixth line, which had too \n many feet. I will send you a copy in case you care to read it. \n \n Let me see if I can\u0027t think of something else pleasant-- \n Oh, yes! I\u0027m learning to skate, and can glide about quite \n respectably all by myself. Also I\u0027ve learned how to slide down \n a rope from the roof of the gymnasium, and I can vault a bar \n three feet and six inches high--I hope shortly to pull up to four feet. \n \n We had a very inspiring sermon this morning preached by the Bishop \n of Alabama. His text was: `Judge not that ye be not judged.\u0027 \n It was about the necessity of overlooking mistakes in others, \n and not discouraging people by harsh judgments. I wish you might \n have heard it. \n \n This is the sunniest, most blinding winter afternoon, with icicles \n dripping from the fir trees and all the world bending under a weight \n of snow--except me, and I\u0027m bending under a weight of sorrow. \n \n Now for the news--courage, Judy!--you must tell. \n \n Are you SURELY in a good humour? I failed in mathematics and \n Latin prose. I am tutoring in them, and will take another examination \n next month. I\u0027m sorry if you\u0027re disappointed, but otherwise I don\u0027t \n care a bit because I\u0027ve learned such a lot of things not mentioned \n in the catalogue. I\u0027ve read seventeen novels and bushels of poetry-- \n really necessary novels like Vanity Fair and Richard Feverel \n and Alice in Wonderland. Also Emerson\u0027s Essays and Lockhart\u0027s \n Life of Scott and the first volume of Gibbon\u0027s Roman Empire \n and half of Benvenuto Cellini\u0027s Life--wasn\u0027t he entertaining? \n He used to saunter out and casually kill a man before breakfast. \n \n So you see, Daddy, I\u0027m much more intelligent than if I\u0027d just stuck \n to Latin. Will you forgive me this once if I promise never to fail again? \n Yours in sackcloth, \n Judy \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59734.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
