{"id":44675,"no":9,"title":"19th December","content":"19th December \\n\\n Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n You never answered my question and it was very important. \\n\\n \\n\\n ARE YOU BALD? \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n I have it planned exactly what you look like--very satisfactorily-- \\n\\n until I reach the top of your head, and then I AM stuck. I can\u0027t \\n\\n decide whether you have white hair or black hair or sort of sprinkly \\n\\n grey hair or maybe none at all. \\n\\n \\n\\n Here is your portrait: \\n\\n \\n\\n But the problem is, shall I add some hair? \\n\\n \\n\\n Would you like to know what colour your eyes are? They\u0027re grey, \\n\\n and your eyebrows stick out like a porch roof (beetling, they\u0027re \\n\\n called in novels), and your mouth is a straight line with a tendency \\n\\n to turn down at the corners. Oh, you see, I know! You\u0027re a snappy \\n\\n old thing with a temper. \\n\\n (Chapel bell.) \\n\\n 9.45 p.m. \\n\\n \\n\\n I have a new unbreakable rule: never, never to study at night no matter \\n\\n how many written reviews are coming in the morning. Instead, I read \\n\\n just plain books--I have to, you know, because there are eighteen \\n\\n blank years behind me. You wouldn\u0027t believe, Daddy, what an abyss \\n\\n of ignorance my mind is; I am just realizing the depths myself. \\n\\n The things that most girls with a properly assorted family and a home \\n\\n and friends and a library know by absorption, I have never heard of. \\n\\n For example: \\n\\n \\n\\n I never read Mother Goose or David Copperfield or Ivanhoe or \\n\\n Cinderella or Blue Beard or Robinson Crusoe or Jane Eyre or Alice \\n\\n in Wonderland or a word of Rudyard Kipling. I didn\u0027t know that Henry \\n\\n the Eighth was married more than once or that Shelley was a poet. \\n\\n I didn\u0027t know that people used to be monkeys and that the Garden \\n\\n of Eden was a beautiful myth. I didn\u0027t know that R. L. S. stood \\n\\n for Robert Louis Stevenson or that George Eliot was a lady. \\n\\n I had never seen a picture of the `Mona Lisa\u0027 and (it\u0027s true but you \\n\\n won\u0027t believe it) I had never heard of Sherlock Holmes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now, I know all of these things and a lot of others besides, \\n\\n but you can see how much I need to catch up. And oh, but it\u0027s fun! \\n\\n I look forward all day to evening, and then I put an `engaged\u0027 on the \\n\\n door and get into my nice red bath robe and furry slippers and pile \\n\\n all the cushions behind me on the couch, and light the brass student \\n\\n lamp at my elbow, and read and read and read one book isn\u0027t enough. \\n\\n I have four going at once. Just now, they\u0027re Tennyson\u0027s poems and \\n\\n Vanity Fair and Kipling\u0027s Plain Tales and--don\u0027t laugh--Little Women. \\n\\n I find that I am the only girl in college who wasn\u0027t brought up on \\n\\n Little Women. I haven\u0027t told anybody though (that WOULD stamp me \\n\\n as queer). I just quietly went and bought it with $1.12 of my last \\n\\n month\u0027s allowance; and the next time somebody mentions pickled limes, \\n\\n I\u0027ll know what she is talking about! \\n\\n \\n\\n (Ten o\u0027clock bell. This is a very interrupted letter.) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Saturday \\n\\n Sir, \\n\\n \\n\\n I have the honour to report fresh explorations in the field of geometry. \\n\\n On Friday last we abandoned our former works in parallelopipeds \\n\\n and proceeded to truncated prisms. We are finding the road rough \\n\\n and very uphill. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Sunday \\n\\n \\n\\n The Christmas holidays begin next week and the trunks are up. \\n\\n The corridors are so filled up that you can hardly get through, \\n\\n and everybody is so bubbling over with excitement that studying is \\n\\n getting left out. I\u0027m going to have a beautiful time in vacation; \\n\\n there\u0027s another Freshman who lives in Texas staying behind, \\n\\n and we are planning to take long walks and if there\u0027s any ice-- \\n\\n learn to skate. Then there is still the whole library to be read-- \\n\\n and three empty weeks to do it in! \\n\\n \\n\\n Goodbye, Daddy, I hope that you are feeling as happy as am. \\n\\n Yours ever, \\n\\n Judy \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. Don\u0027t forget to answer my question. If you don\u0027t want \\n\\n the trouble of writing, have your secretary telegraph. He can \\n\\n \\n\\n just say: \\n\\n Mr. Smith is quite bald, \\n\\n \\n\\n or \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Smith is not bald, \\n\\n \\n\\n or \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Smith has white hair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n And you can deduct the twenty-five cents out of my allowance. \\n\\n \\n\\n Goodbye till January--and a merry Christmas! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59731.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
