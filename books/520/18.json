{"id":44684,"no":18,"title":"8th hour, Monday","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n I hope you aren\u0027t the Trustee who sat on the toad? It went off-- \n I was told--with quite a pop, so probably he was a fatter Trustee. \n \n Do you remember the little dugout places with gratings over them \n by the laundry windows in the John Grier Home? Every spring when the \n hoptoad season opened we used to form a collection of toads and keep \n them in those window holes; and occasionally they would spill over \n into the laundry, causing a very pleasurable commotion on wash days. \n We were severely punished for our activities in this direction, \n but in spite of all discouragement the toads would collect. \n \n And one day--well, I won\u0027t bore you with particulars--but somehow, \n one of the fattest, biggest, JUCIEST toads got into one of those \n big leather arm chairs in the Trustees\u0027 room, and that afternoon \n at the Trustees\u0027 meeting--But I dare say you were there and recall \n the rest? \n \n Looking back dispassionately after a period of time, I will say \n that punishment was merited, and--if I remember rightly--adequate. \n \n I don\u0027t know why I am in such a reminiscent mood except that \n spring and the reappearance of toads always awakens the old \n acquisitive instinct. The only thing that keeps me from starting \n a collection is the fact that no rule exists against it. \n \n \n \n After chapel, Thursday \n \n What do you think is my favourite book? Just now, I mean; I change \n every three days. Wuthering Heights. Emily Bronte was quite young \n when she wrote it, and had never been outside of Haworth churchyard. \n She had never known any men in her life; how COULD she imagine a man \n like Heathcliffe? \n \n I couldn\u0027t do it, and I\u0027m quite young and never outside the John \n Grier Asylum--I\u0027ve had every chance in the world. Sometimes a \n dreadful fear comes over me that I\u0027m not a genius. Will you be \n awfully disappointed, Daddy, if I don\u0027t turn out to be a great author? \n In the spring when everything is so beautiful and green and budding, \n I feel like turning my back on lessons, and running away to play with \n the weather. There are such lots of adventures out in the fields! \n It\u0027s much more entertaining to live books than to write them. \n \n Ow ! ! ! ! ! ! \n \n That was a shriek which brought Sallie and Julia and (for a \n disgusted moment) the Senior from across the hall. It was caused \n by a centipede like this: only worse. Just as I had finished the \n last sentence and was thinking what to say next--plump!--it fell off \n the ceiling and landed at my side. I tipped two cups off the tea \n table in trying to get away. Sallie whacked it with the back of my \n hair brush--which I shall never be able to use again--and killed \n the front end, but the rear fifty feet ran under the bureau and escaped. \n \n This dormitory, owing to its age and ivy-covered walls, is full \n of centipedes. They are dreadful creatures. I\u0027d rather find \n a tiger under the bed. \n \n \n Friday, 9.30 p.m. \n \n Such a lot of troubles! I didn\u0027t hear the rising bell this morning, \n then I broke my shoestring while I was hurrying to dress and \n dropped my collar button down my neck. I was late for breakfast \n and also for first-hour recitation. I forgot to take any blotting \n paper and my fountain pen leaked. In trigonometry the Professor \n and I had a disagreement touching a little matter of logarithms. \n On looking it up, I find that she was right. We had mutton stew \n and pie-plant for lunch--hate \u0027em both; they taste like the asylum. \n The post brought me nothing but bills (though I must say that I \n never do get anything else; my family are not the kind that write). \n In English class this afternoon we had an unexpected written lesson. \n This was it: \n \n I asked no other thing, \n No other was denied. \n I offered Being for it; \n The mighty merchant smiled. \n \n Brazil? He twirled a button \n Without a glance my way: \n But, madam, is there nothing else \n That we can show today? \n \n \n That is a poem. I don\u0027t know who wrote it or what it means. It \n was simply printed out on the blackboard when we arrived and we \n were ordered to comment upon it. When I read the first verse \n I thought I had an idea--The Mighty Merchant was a divinity \n who distributes blessings in return for virtuous deeds-- \n but when I got to the second verse and found him twirling a button, \n it seemed a blasphemous supposition, and I hastily changed my mind. \n The rest of the class was in the same predicament; and there we \n sat for three-quarters of an hour with blank paper and equally \n blank minds. Getting an education is an awfully wearing process! \n \n But this didn\u0027t end the day. There\u0027s worse to come. \n \n It rained so we couldn\u0027t play golf, but had to go to gymnasium instead. \n The girl next to me banged my elbow with an Indian club. I got \n home to find that the box with my new blue spring dress had come, \n and the skirt was so tight that I couldn\u0027t sit down. Friday is \n sweeping day, and the maid had mixed all the papers on my desk. \n We had tombstone for dessert (milk and gelatin flavoured with vanilla). \n We were kept in chapel twenty minutes later than usual to listen to \n a speech about womanly women. And then--just as I was settling down \n with a sigh of well-earned relief to The Portrait of a Lady, a girl \n named Ackerly, a dough-faced, deadly, unintermittently stupid girl, \n who sits next to me in Latin because her name begins with A (I \n wish Mrs. Lippett had named me Zabriski), came to ask if Monday\u0027s \n lesson commenced at paragraph 69 or 70, and stayed ONE HOUR. \n She has just gone. \n \n Did you ever hear of such a discouraging series of events? \n It isn\u0027t the big troubles in life that require character. \n Anybody can rise to a crisis and face a crushing tragedy with courage, \n but to meet the petty hazards of the day with a laugh--I really \n think that requires SPIRIT. \n \n It\u0027s the kind of character that I am going to develop. I am \n going to pretend that all life is just a game which I must play \n as skilfully and fairly as I can. If I lose, I am going to shrug \n my shoulders and laugh--also if I win. \n \n Anyway, I am going to be a sport. You will never hear me \n complain again, Daddy dear, because Julia wears silk stockings \n and centipedes drop off the wall. \n Yours ever, \n Judy \n \n Answer soon. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59740.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
