{"id":44715,"no":49,"title":"7th December","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, Thank you for permission to visit Julia--I take it that silence means consent. Such a social whirl as we\u0027ve been having! The Founder\u0027s dance came last week--this was the first year that any of us could attend; only upper classmen being allowed. I invited Jimmie McBride, and Sallie invited his room-mate at Princeton, who visited them last summer at their camp--an awfully nice man with red hair--and Julia invited a man from New York, not very exciting, but socially irreproachable. He is connected with the De la Mater Chichesters. Perhaps that means something to you? It doesn\u0027t illuminate me to any extent. However--our guests came Friday afternoon in time for tea in the senior corridor, and then dashed down to the hotel for dinner. The hotel was so full that they slept in rows on the billiard tables, they say. Jimmie McBride says that the next time he is bidden to a social event in this college, he is going to bring one of their Adirondack tents and pitch it on the campus. At seven-thirty they came back for the President\u0027s reception and dance. Our functions commence early! We had the men\u0027s cards all made out ahead of time, and after every dance, we\u0027d leave them in groups, under the letter that stood for their names, so that they could be readily found by their next partners. Jimmie McBride, for example, would stand patiently under `M\u0027 until he was claimed. (At least, he ought to have stood patiently, but he kept wandering off and getting mixed with `R\u0027s\u0027 and `S\u0027s\u0027 and all sorts of letters.) I found him a very difficult guest; he was sulky because he had only three dances with me. He said he was bashful about dancing with girls he didn\u0027t know! The next morning we had a glee club concert--and who do you think wrote the funny new song composed for the occasion? It\u0027s the truth. She did. Oh, I tell you, Daddy, your little foundling is getting to be quite a prominent person! Anyway, our gay two days were great fun, and I think the men enjoyed it. Some of them were awfully perturbed at first at the prospect of facing one thousand girls; but they got acclimated very quickly. Our two Princeton men had a beautiful time--at least they politely said they had, and they\u0027ve invited us to their dance next spring. We\u0027ve accepted, so please don\u0027t object, Daddy dear. Julia and Sallie and I all had new dresses. Do you want to hear about them? Julia\u0027s was cream satin and gold embroidery and she wore purple orchids. It was a DREAM and came from Paris, and cost a million dollars. Sallie\u0027s was pale blue trimmed with Persian embroidery, and went beautifully with red hair. It didn\u0027t cost quite a million, but was just as effective as Julia\u0027s. Mine was pale pink crepe de chine trimmed with ecru lace and rose satin. And I carried crimson roses which J. McB. sent (Sallie having told him what colour to get). And we all had satin slippers and silk stockings and chiffon scarfs to match. You must be deeply impressed by these millinery details. One can\u0027t help thinking, Daddy, what a colourless life a man is forced to lead, when one reflects that chiffon and Venetian point and hand embroidery and Irish crochet are to him mere empty words. Whereas a woman--whether she is interested in babies or microbes or husbands or poetry or servants or parallelograms or gardens or Plato or bridge--is fundamentally and always interested in clothes. It\u0027s the one touch of nature that makes the whole world kin. (That isn\u0027t original. I got it out of one of Shakespeare\u0027s plays). However, to resume. Do you want me to tell you a secret that I\u0027ve lately discovered? And will you promise not to think me vain? Then listen: I\u0027m pretty. I am, really. I\u0027d be an awful idiot not to know it with three looking-glasses in the room. A Friend PS. This is one of those wicked anonymous letters you read about in novels.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59771.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
