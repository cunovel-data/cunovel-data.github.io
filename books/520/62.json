{"id":44728,"no":62,"title":"12th Jan.","content":"Dear Mr. Philanthropist, \\n\\n \\n\\n Your cheque for my family came yesterday. Thank you so much! \\n\\n I cut gymnasium and took it down to them right after luncheon, \\n\\n and you should have seen the girl\u0027s face! She was so surprised \\n\\n and happy and relieved that she looked almost young; and she\u0027s only \\n\\n twenty-four. Isn\u0027t it pitiful? \\n\\n \\n\\n Anyway, she feels now as though all the good things were coming together. \\n\\n She has steady work ahead for two months--someone\u0027s getting married, \\n\\n and there\u0027s a trousseau to make. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Thank the good Lord!\u0027 cried the mother, when she grasped the fact \\n\\n that that small piece of paper was one hundred dollars. \\n\\n \\n\\n `It wasn\u0027t the good Lord at all,\u0027 said I, `it was Daddy-Long-Legs.\u0027 \\n\\n (Mr. Smith, I called you.) \\n\\n \\n\\n `But it was the good Lord who put it in his mind,\u0027 said she. \\n\\n \\n\\n `Not at all! I put it in his mind myself,\u0027 said I. \\n\\n \\n\\n But anyway, Daddy, I trust the good Lord will reward you suitably. \\n\\n You deserve ten thousand years out of purgatory. \\n\\n Yours most gratefully, \\n\\n Judy Abbott \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 15th Feb. \\n\\n May it please Your Most Excellent Majesty: \\n\\n \\n\\n This morning I did eat my breakfast upon a cold turkey pie \\n\\n and a goose, and I did send for a cup of tee (a china drink) \\n\\n of which I had never drank before. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don\u0027t be nervous, Daddy--I haven\u0027t lost my mind; I\u0027m merely quoting \\n\\n Sam\u0027l Pepys. We\u0027re reading him in connection with English History, \\n\\n original sources. Sallie and Julia and I converse now in the language \\n\\n of 1660. Listen to this: \\n\\n \\n\\n `I went to Charing Cross to see Major Harrison hanged, \\n\\n drawn and quartered: he looking as cheerful as any man could \\n\\n do in that condition.\u0027 And this: `Dined with my lady who is \\n\\n in handsome mourning for her brother who died yesterday of spotted fever.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Seems a little early to commence entertaining, doesn\u0027t it? A friend \\n\\n of Pepys devised a very cunning manner whereby the king might pay \\n\\n his debts out of the sale to poor people of old decayed provisions. \\n\\n What do you, a reformer, think of that? I don\u0027t believe we\u0027re so bad \\n\\n today as the newspapers make out. \\n\\n \\n\\n Samuel was as excited about his clothes as any girl; he spent \\n\\n five times as much on dress as his wife--that appears to have \\n\\n been the Golden Age of husbands. Isn\u0027t this a touching entry? \\n\\n You see he really was honest. `Today came home my fine Camlett \\n\\n cloak with gold buttons, which cost me much money, and I pray God \\n\\n to make me able to pay for it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Excuse me for being so full of Pepys; I\u0027m writing a special topic \\n\\n on him. \\n\\n \\n\\n What do you think, Daddy? The Self-Government Association has \\n\\n abolished the ten o\u0027clock rule. We can keep our lights all night \\n\\n if we choose, the only requirement being that we do not disturb others-- \\n\\n we are not supposed to entertain on a large scale. The result is a \\n\\n beautiful commentary on human nature. Now that we may stay up as long \\n\\n as we choose, we no longer choose. Our heads begin to nod at nine \\n\\n o\u0027clock, and by nine-thirty the pen drops from our nerveless grasp. \\n\\n It\u0027s nine-thirty now. Good night. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Sunday \\n\\n \\n\\n Just back from church--preacher from Georgia. We must take care, he says, \\n\\n not to develop our intellects at the expense of our emotional natures-- \\n\\n but methought it was a poor, dry sermon (Pepys again). It doesn\u0027t \\n\\n matter what part of the United States or Canada they come from, \\n\\n or what denomination they are, we always get the same sermon. \\n\\n Why on earth don\u0027t they go to men\u0027s colleges and urge the students \\n\\n not to allow their manly natures to be crushed out by too much \\n\\n mental application? \\n\\n \\n\\n It\u0027s a beautiful day--frozen and icy and clear. As soon as dinner \\n\\n is over, Sallie and Julia and Marty Keene and Eleanor Pratt (friends \\n\\n of mine, but you don\u0027t know them) and I are going to put on short \\n\\n skirts and walk \u0027cross country to Crystal Spring Farm and have a fried \\n\\n chicken and waffle supper, and then have Mr. Crystal Spring drive \\n\\n us home in his buckboard. We are supposed to be inside the campus \\n\\n at seven, but we are going to stretch a point tonight and make it eight. \\n\\n \\n\\n Farewell, kind Sir. \\n\\n I have the honour of subscribing myself, \\n\\n Your most loyall, dutifull, faithfull and obedient \\n\\n servant, \\n\\n J. Abbott \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59784.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
