{"id":44725,"no":59,"title":"17th November","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Such a blight has fallen over my literary career. I don\u0027t know \\n\\n whether to tell you or not, but I would like some sympathy-- \\n\\n silent sympathy, please; don\u0027t re-open the wound by referring to it \\n\\n in your next letter. \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027ve been writing a book, all last winter in the evenings, and all \\n\\n the summer when I wasn\u0027t teaching Latin to my two stupid children. \\n\\n I just finished it before college opened and sent it to a publisher. \\n\\n He kept it two months, and I was certain he was going to take it; \\n\\n but yesterday morning an express parcel came (thirty cents due) \\n\\n and there it was back again with a letter from the publisher, a very nice, \\n\\n fatherly letter--but frank! He said he saw from the address that I \\n\\n was still at college, and if I would accept some advice, he would \\n\\n suggest that I put all of my energy into my lessons and wait until I \\n\\n graduated before beginning to write. He enclosed his reader\u0027s opinion. \\n\\n Here it is: \\n\\n \\n\\n `Plot highly improbable. Characterization exaggerated. \\n\\n Conversation unnatural. A good deal of humour but not always \\n\\n in the best of taste. Tell her to keep on trying, and in time \\n\\n she may produce a real book.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Not on the whole flattering, is it, Daddy? And I thought I was \\n\\n making a notable addition to American literature. I did truly. \\n\\n I was planning to surprise you by writing a great novel before \\n\\n I graduated. I collected the material for it while I was at \\n\\n Julia\u0027s last Christmas. But I dare say the editor is right. \\n\\n Probably two weeks was not enough in which to observe the manners \\n\\n and customs of a great city. \\n\\n \\n\\n I took it walking with me yesterday afternoon, and when I came \\n\\n to the gas house, I went in and asked the engineer if I might borrow \\n\\n his furnace. He politely opened the door, and with my own hands \\n\\n I chucked it in. I felt as though I had cremated my only child! \\n\\n \\n\\n I went to bed last night utterly dejected; I thought I was never \\n\\n going to amount to anything, and that you had thrown away your \\n\\n money for nothing. But what do you think? I woke up this morning \\n\\n with a beautiful new plot in my head, and I\u0027ve been going about \\n\\n all day planning my characters, just as happy as I could be. \\n\\n No one can ever accuse me of being a pessimist! If I had a husband \\n\\n and twelve children swallowed by an earthquake one day, I\u0027d bob \\n\\n up smilingly the next morning and commence to look for another set. \\n\\n Affectionately, \\n\\n Judy \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59781.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
