{"id":44732,"no":66,"title":"LOCK WILLOW, 19th June","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m educated! My diploma is in the bottom bureau drawer with my \\n\\n two best dresses. Commencement was as usual, with a few showers \\n\\n at vital moments. Thank you for your rosebuds. They were lovely. \\n\\n Master Jervie and Master Jimmie both gave me roses, too, but I left \\n\\n theirs in the bath tub and carried yours in the class procession. \\n\\n \\n\\n Here I am at Lock Willow for the summer--for ever maybe. The board \\n\\n is cheap; the surroundings quiet and conducive to a literary life. \\n\\n What more does a struggling author wish? I am mad about my book. \\n\\n I think of it every waking moment, and dream of it at night. All I \\n\\n want is peace and quiet and lots of time to work (interspersed with \\n\\n nourishing meals). \\n\\n \\n\\n Master Jervie is coming up for a week or so in August, and Jimmie \\n\\n McBride is going to drop in sometime through the summer. \\n\\n He\u0027s connected with a bond house now, and goes about the country \\n\\n selling bonds to banks. He\u0027s going to combine the `Farmers\u0027 National\u0027 \\n\\n at the Corners and me on the same trip. \\n\\n \\n\\n You see that Lock Willow isn\u0027t entirely lacking in society. \\n\\n I\u0027d be expecting to have you come motoring through--only I know now \\n\\n that that is hopeless. When you wouldn\u0027t come to my commencement, \\n\\n I tore you from my heart and buried you for ever. \\n\\n Judy Abbott, A.B. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59788.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
