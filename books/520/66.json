{"id":44732,"no":66,"title":"LOCK WILLOW, 19th June","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, I\u0027m educated! My diploma is in the bottom bureau drawer with my two best dresses. Commencement was as usual, with a few showers at vital moments. Thank you for your rosebuds. They were lovely. Master Jervie and Master Jimmie both gave me roses, too, but I left theirs in the bath tub and carried yours in the class procession. Here I am at Lock Willow for the summer--for ever maybe. The board is cheap; the surroundings quiet and conducive to a literary life. What more does a struggling author wish? I am mad about my book. I think of it every waking moment, and dream of it at night. All I want is peace and quiet and lots of time to work (interspersed with nourishing meals). Master Jervie is coming up for a week or so in August, and Jimmie McBride is going to drop in sometime through the summer. He\u0027s connected with a bond house now, and goes about the country selling bonds to banks. He\u0027s going to combine the `Farmers\u0027 National\u0027 at the Corners and me on the same trip. You see that Lock Willow isn\u0027t entirely lacking in society. I\u0027d be expecting to have you come motoring through--only I know now that that is hopeless. When you wouldn\u0027t come to my commencement, I tore you from my heart and buried you for ever.
