They belong to a sort of club on a lovely little \n lake in the middle of the woods. The different members have houses \n made of logs dotted about among the trees, and they go canoeing \n on the lake, and take long walks through trails to other camps, \n and have dances once a week in the club house--Jimmie McBride is \n going to have a college friend visiting him part of the summer, \n so you see we shall have plenty of men to dance with. \n \n Wasn\u0027t it sweet of Mrs. McBride to ask me? It appears that she \n liked me when I was there for Christmas. \n \n Please excuse this being short. It isn\u0027t a real letter; it\u0027s just \n to let you know that I\u0027m disposed of for the summer. \n Yours, \n In a VERY contented frame of mind, \n Judy \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59761.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
