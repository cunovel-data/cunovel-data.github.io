{"id":44720,"no":54,"title":"15th May","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Is it good manners when you get into a car just to stare straight \\n\\n ahead and not see anybody else? \\n\\n \\n\\n A very beautiful lady in a very beautiful velvet dress got \\n\\n into the car today, and without the slightest expression sat \\n\\n for fifteen minutes and looked at a sign advertising suspenders. \\n\\n It doesn\u0027t seem polite to ignore everybody else as though you \\n\\n were the only important person present. Anyway, you miss a lot. \\n\\n While she was absorbing that silly sign, I was studying a whole car \\n\\n full of interesting human beings. \\n\\n \\n\\n The accompanying illustration is hereby reproduced for the first time. \\n\\n It looks like a spider on the end of a string, but it isn\u0027t at all; \\n\\n it\u0027s a picture of me learning to swim in the tank in the gymnasium. \\n\\n \\n\\n The instructor hooks a rope into a ring in the back of my belt, and runs \\n\\n it through a pulley in the ceiling. It would be a beautiful system \\n\\n if one had perfect confidence in the probity of one\u0027s instructor. \\n\\n I\u0027m always afraid, though, that she will let the rope get slack, \\n\\n so I keep one anxious eye on her and swim with the other, \\n\\n and with this divided interest I do not make the progress that I \\n\\n otherwise might. \\n\\n \\n\\n Very miscellaneous weather we\u0027re having of late. It was raining \\n\\n when I commenced and now the sun is shining. Sallie and I are going \\n\\n out to play tennis--thereby gaining exemption from Gym. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n A week later \\n\\n \\n\\n I should have finished this letter long ago, but I didn\u0027t. You \\n\\n don\u0027t mind, do you, Daddy, if I\u0027m not very regular? I really \\n\\n do love to write to you; it gives me such a respectable feeling \\n\\n of having some family. Would you like me to tell you something? \\n\\n You are not the only man to whom I write letters. There are \\n\\n two others! I have been receiving beautiful long letters this \\n\\n winter from Master Jervie (with typewritten envelopes so Julia won\u0027t \\n\\n recognize the writing). Did you ever hear anything so shocking? \\n\\n And every week or so a very scrawly epistle, usually on yellow \\n\\n tablet paper, arrives from Princeton. All of which I answer \\n\\n with business-like promptness. So you see--I am not so different \\n\\n from other girls--I get letters, too. \\n\\n \\n\\n Did I tell you that I have been elected a member of the Senior \\n\\n Dramatic Club? Very recherche organization. Only seventy-five \\n\\n members out of one thousand. Do you think as a consistent Socialist \\n\\n that I ought to belong? \\n\\n \\n\\n What do you suppose is at present engaging my attention in sociology? \\n\\n I am writing (figurez vous!) a paper on the Care of Dependent Children. \\n\\n The Professor shuffled up his subjects and dealt them out promiscuously, \\n\\n and that fell to me. C\u0027est drole ca n\u0027est pas? \\n\\n \\n\\n There goes the gong for dinner. I\u0027ll post this as I pass the box. \\n\\n Affectionately, \\n\\n J. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59776.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
