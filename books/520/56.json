{"id":44722,"no":56,"title":"19th August","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n My window looks out on the loveliest landscape--ocean-scape, rather-- \n nothing but water and rocks. \n \n The summer goes. I spend the morning with Latin and English \n and algebra and my two stupid girls. I don\u0027t know how Marion is \n ever going to get into college, or stay in after she gets there. \n And as for Florence, she is hopeless--but oh! such a little beauty. \n I don\u0027t suppose it matters in the least whether they are stupid \n or not so long as they are pretty? One can\u0027t help thinking, though, \n how their conversation will bore their husbands, unless they \n are fortunate enough to obtain stupid husbands. I suppose that\u0027s \n quite possible; the world seems to be filled with stupid men; \n I\u0027ve met a number this summer. \n \n In the afternoon we take a walk on the cliffs, or swim, if the tide \n is right. I can swim in salt water with the utmost ease you see \n my education is already being put to use! \n \n A letter comes from Mr. Jervis Pendleton in Paris, rather a short \n concise letter; I\u0027m not quite forgiven yet for refusing to follow \n his advice. However, if he gets back in time, he will see me \n for a few days at Lock Willow before college opens, and if I \n am very nice and sweet and docile, I shall (I am led to infer) \n be received into favour again. \n \n Also a letter from Sallie. She wants me to come to their camp \n for two weeks in September. Must I ask your permission, or haven\u0027t \n I yet arrived at the place where I can do as I please? Yes, I am \n sure I have--I\u0027m a Senior, you know. Having worked all summer, \n I feel like taking a little healthful recreation; I want to see \n the Adirondacks; I want to see Sallie; I want to see Sallie\u0027s brother-- \n he\u0027s going to teach me to canoe--and (we come to my chief motive, \n which is mean) I want Master Jervie to arrive at Lock Willow and find \n me not there. \n \n I MUST show him that he can\u0027t dictate to me. No one can dictate \n to me but you, Daddy--and you can\u0027t always! I\u0027m off for the woods. \n Judy \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59778.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
