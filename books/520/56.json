{"id":44722,"no":56,"title":"19th August","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, My window looks out on the loveliest landscape--ocean-scape, rather-- nothing but water and rocks. The summer goes. I spend the morning with Latin and English and algebra and my two stupid girls. I don\u0027t know how Marion is ever going to get into college, or stay in after she gets there. And as for Florence, she is hopeless--but oh! such a little beauty. I don\u0027t suppose it matters in the least whether they are stupid or not so long as they are pretty? One can\u0027t help thinking, though, how their conversation will bore their husbands, unless they are fortunate enough to obtain stupid husbands. I suppose that\u0027s quite possible; the world seems to be filled with stupid men; I\u0027ve met a number this summer. In the afternoon we take a walk on the cliffs, or swim, if the tide is right. I can swim in salt water with the utmost ease you see my education is already being put to use! A letter comes from Mr. Jervis Pendleton in Paris, rather a short concise letter; I\u0027m not quite forgiven yet for refusing to follow his advice. However, if he gets back in time, he will see me for a few days at Lock Willow before college opens, and if I am very nice and sweet and docile, I shall (I am led to infer) be received into favour again. Also a letter from Sallie. She wants me to come to their camp for two weeks in September. Must I ask your permission, or haven\u0027t I yet arrived at the place where I can do as I please? Yes, I am sure I have--I\u0027m a Senior, you know. Having worked all summer, I feel like taking a little healthful recreation; I want to see the Adirondacks; I want to see Sallie; I want to see Sallie\u0027s brother-- he\u0027s going to teach me to canoe--and (we come to my chief motive, which is mean) I want Master Jervie to arrive at Lock Willow and find me not there. I MUST show him that he can\u0027t dictate to me. No one can dictate to me but you, Daddy--and you can\u0027t always! I\u0027m off for the woods.
