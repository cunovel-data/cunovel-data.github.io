{"id":44677,"no":11,"title":"On the Eve","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n You should see the way this college is studying! We\u0027ve forgotten we \n ever had a vacation. Fifty-seven irregular verbs have I introduced \n to my brain in the past four days--I\u0027m only hoping they\u0027ll stay \n till after examinations. \n \n Some of the girls sell their text-books when they\u0027re through with them, \n but I intend to keep mine. Then after I\u0027ve graduated I shall have \n my whole education in a row in the bookcase, and when I need to use \n any detail, I can turn to it without the slightest hesitation. \n So much easier and more accurate than trying to keep it in your head. \n \n Julia Pendleton dropped in this evening to pay a social call, \n and stayed a solid hour. She got started on the subject of family, \n and I COULDN\u0027T switch her off. She wanted to know what my \n mother\u0027s maiden name was--did you ever hear such an impertinent \n question to ask of a person from a foundling asylum? I didn\u0027t \n have the courage to say I didn\u0027t know, so I just miserably plumped \n on the first name I could think of, and that was Montgomery. \n Then she wanted to know whether I belonged to the Massachusetts \n Montgomerys or the Virginia Montgomerys. \n \n Her mother was a Rutherford. The family came over in the ark, \n and were connected by marriage with Henry the VIII. On her father\u0027s \n side they date back further than Adam. On the topmost branches \n of her family tree there\u0027s a superior breed of monkeys with very \n fine silky hair and extra long tails. \n \n I meant to write you a nice, cheerful, entertaining letter tonight, \n but I\u0027m too sleepy--and scared. The Freshman\u0027s lot is not a happy one. \n Yours, about to be examined, \n Judy Abbott \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59733.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
