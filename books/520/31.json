{"id":44697,"no":31,"title":"20th Jan.","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, Did you ever have a sweet baby girl who was stolen from the cradle in infancy? Maybe I am she! If we were in a novel, that would be the denouement, wouldn\u0027t it? It\u0027s really awfully queer not to know what one is--sort of exciting and romantic. There are such a lot of possibilities. Maybe I\u0027m not American; lots of people aren\u0027t. I may be straight descended from the ancient Romans, or I may be a Viking\u0027s daughter, or I may be the child of a Russian exile and belong by rights in a Siberian prison, or maybe I\u0027m a Gipsy--I think perhaps I am. I have a very WANDERING spirit, though I haven\u0027t as yet had much chance to develop it. Do you know about that one scandalous blot in my career the time I ran away from the asylum because they punished me for stealing cookies? It\u0027s down in the books free for any Trustee to read. But really, Daddy, what could you expect? When you put a hungry little nine-year girl in the pantry scouring knives, with the cookie jar at her elbow, and go off and leave her alone; and then suddenly pop in again, wouldn\u0027t you expect to find her a bit crumby? And then when you jerk her by the elbow and box her ears, and make her leave the table when the pudding comes, and tell all the other children that it\u0027s because she\u0027s a thief, wouldn\u0027t you expect her to run away? I only ran four miles. They caught me and brought me back; and every day for a week I was tied, like a naughty puppy, to a stake in the back yard while the other children were out at recess. Oh, dear! There\u0027s the chapel bell, and after chapel I have a committee meeting. I\u0027m sorry because I meant to write you a very entertaining letter this time. Auf wiedersehen Cher Daddy, Pax tibi! Judy PS. There\u0027s one thing I\u0027m perfectly sure of I\u0027m not a Chinaman.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59753.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
