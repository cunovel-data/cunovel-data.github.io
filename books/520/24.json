{"id":44690,"no":24,"title":"Sunday","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, Isn\u0027t it funny? I started to write to you yesterday afternoon, but as far as I got was the heading, `Dear Daddy-Long-Legs\u0027, and then I remembered I\u0027d promised to pick some blackberries for supper, so I went off and left the sheet lying on the table, and when I came back today, what do you think I found sitting in the middle of the page? A real true Daddy-Long-Legs! I picked him up very gently by one leg, and dropped him out of the window. I wouldn\u0027t hurt one of them for the world. They always remind me of you. We hitched up the spring wagon this morning and drove to the Centre to church. It\u0027s a sweet little white frame church with a spire and three Doric columns in front (or maybe Ionic--I always get them mixed). A nice sleepy sermon with everybody drowsily waving palm-leaf fans, and the only sound, aside from the minister, the buzzing of locusts in the trees outside. I didn\u0027t wake up till I found myself on my feet singing the hymn, and then I was awfully sorry I hadn\u0027t listened to the sermon; I should like to know more of the psychology of a man who would pick out such a hymn. This was it: Come, leave your sports and earthly toys And join me in celestial joys. Or else, dear friend, a long farewell. I leave you now to sink to hell. I find that it isn\u0027t safe to discuss religion with the Semples. Their God (whom they have inherited intact from their remote Puritan ancestors) is a narrow, irrational, unjust, mean, revengeful, bigoted Person. Thank heaven I don\u0027t inherit God from anybody! I am free to make mine up as I wish Him. He\u0027s kind and sympathetic and imaginative and forgiving and understanding--and He has a sense of humour. I like the Semples immensely; their practice is so superior to their theory. They are better than their own God. I told them so-- and they are horribly troubled. They think I am blasphemous-- and I think they are! We\u0027ve dropped theology from our conversation. This is Sunday afternoon. Amasai (hired man) in a purple tie and some bright yellow buckskin gloves, very red and shaved, has just driven off with Carrie (hired girl) in a big hat trimmed with red roses and a blue muslin dress and her hair curled as tight as it will curl. Amasai spent all the morning washing the buggy; and Carrie stayed home from church ostensibly to cook the dinner, but really to iron the muslin dress. In two minutes more when this letter is finished I am going to settle down to a book which I found in the attic. It\u0027s entitled, On the Trail, and sprawled across the front page in a funny little-boy hand: Jervis Pendleton if this book should ever roam, Box its ears and send it home. He spent the summer here once after he had been ill, when he was about eleven years old; and he left On the Trail behind. It looks well read--the marks of his grimy little hands are frequent! Also in a corner of the attic there is a water wheel and a windmill and some bows and arrows. Mrs. Semple talks so constantly about him that I begin to believe he really lives--not a grown man with a silk hat and walking stick, but a nice, dirty, tousle-headed boy who clatters up the stairs with an awful racket, and leaves the screen doors open, and is always asking for cookies. (And getting them, too, if I know Mrs. Semple!) He seems to have been an adventurous little soul-- and brave and truthful. I\u0027m sorry to think he is a Pendleton; he was meant for something better. We\u0027re going to begin threshing oats tomorrow; a steam engine is coming and three extra men. It grieves me to tell you that Buttercup (the spotted cow with one horn, Mother of Lesbia) has done a disgraceful thing. She got into the orchard Friday evening and ate apples under the trees, and ate and ate until they went to her head. For two days she has been perfectly dead drunk! That is the truth I am telling. Did you ever hear anything so scandalous? Sir, I remain, Your affectionate orphan, Judy Abbott PS. Indians in the first chapter and highwaymen in the second. I hold my breath. What can the third contain? `Red Hawk leapt twenty feet in the air and bit the dust.\u0027 That is the subject of the frontispiece. Aren\u0027t Judy and Jervie having fun?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59746.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
