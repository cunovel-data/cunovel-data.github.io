{"id":44668,"no":2,"title":"215 FERGUSSEN HALL 24th September","content":"Dear Kind-Trustee-Who-Sends-Orphans-to-College, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Here I am! I travelled yesterday for four hours in a train. \\n\\n It\u0027s a funny sensation, isn\u0027t it? I never rode in one before. \\n\\n \\n\\n College is the biggest, most bewildering place--I get lost whenever \\n\\n I leave my room. I will write you a description later when I\u0027m \\n\\n feeling less muddled; also I will tell you about my lessons. \\n\\n Classes don\u0027t begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night. \\n\\n But I wanted to write a letter first just to get acquainted. \\n\\n \\n\\n It seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you don\u0027t know. \\n\\n It seems queer for me to be writing letters at all--I\u0027ve never \\n\\n written more than three or four in my life, so please overlook it \\n\\n if these are not a model kind. \\n\\n \\n\\n Before leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very \\n\\n serious talk. She told me how to behave all the rest of my life, \\n\\n and especially how to behave towards the kind gentleman who is doing \\n\\n so much for me. I must take care to be Very Respectful. \\n\\n \\n\\n But how can one be very respectful to a person who \\n\\n wishes to be called John Smith? Why couldn\u0027t you \\n\\n have picked out a name with a little personality? \\n\\n I might as well write letters to Dear Hitching-Post or Dear Clothes-Prop. \\n\\n \\n\\n I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer; having \\n\\n somebody take an interest in me after all these years makes me \\n\\n feel as though I had found a sort of family. It seems as though I \\n\\n belonged to somebody now, and it\u0027s a very comfortable sensation. \\n\\n I must say, however, that when I think about you, my imagination \\n\\n has very little to work upon. There are just three things that \\n\\n I know: \\n\\n \\n\\n I. You are tall. \\n\\n \\n\\n II. You are rich. \\n\\n \\n\\n III. You hate girls. \\n\\n \\n\\n I suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater. Only that\u0027s rather \\n\\n insulting to me. Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that\u0027s insulting \\n\\n to you, as though money were the only important thing about you. \\n\\n Besides, being rich is such a very external quality. Maybe you \\n\\n won\u0027t stay rich all your life; lots of very clever men get smashed \\n\\n up in Wall Street. But at least you will stay tall all your life! \\n\\n So I\u0027ve decided to call you Dear Daddy-Long-Legs. I hope you won\u0027t mind. \\n\\n It\u0027s just a private pet name we won\u0027t tell Mrs. Lippett. \\n\\n \\n\\n The ten o\u0027clock bell is going to ring in two minutes. Our day is \\n\\n divided into sections by bells. We eat and sleep and study by bells. \\n\\n It\u0027s very enlivening; I feel like a fire horse all of the time. \\n\\n There it goes! Lights out. Good night. \\n\\n \\n\\n Observe with what precision I obey rules--due to my training \\n\\n in the John Grier Home. \\n\\n Yours most respectfully, \\n\\n Jerusha Abbott \\n\\n To Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 1st October \\n\\n Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n I love college and I love you for sending me--I\u0027m very, very happy, \\n\\n and so excited every moment of the time that I can scarcely sleep. \\n\\n You can\u0027t imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home. \\n\\n I never dreamed there was such a place in the world. I\u0027m feeling \\n\\n sorry for everybody who isn\u0027t a girl and who can\u0027t come here; I am \\n\\n sure the college you attended when you were a boy couldn\u0027t have been \\n\\n so nice. \\n\\n \\n\\n My room is up in a tower that used to be the contagious ward \\n\\n before they built the new infirmary. There are three other girls \\n\\n on the same floor of the tower--a Senior who wears spectacles \\n\\n and is always asking us please to be a little more quiet, and two \\n\\n Freshmen named Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton. \\n\\n Sallie has red hair and a turn-up nose and is quite friendly; \\n\\n Julia comes from one of the first families in New York and hasn\u0027t \\n\\n noticed me yet. They room together and the Senior and I have singles. \\n\\n Usually Freshmen can\u0027t get singles; they are very scarce, but I got \\n\\n one without even asking. I suppose the registrar didn\u0027t think it would \\n\\n be right to ask a properly brought-up girl to room with a foundling. \\n\\n You see there are advantages! \\n\\n \\n\\n My room is on the north-west corner with two windows and a view. \\n\\n After you\u0027ve lived in a ward for eighteen years with twenty \\n\\n room-mates, it is restful to be alone. This is the first chance \\n\\n I\u0027ve ever had to get acquainted with Jerusha Abbott. I think I\u0027m \\n\\n going to like her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Do you think you are? \\n\\n \\n\\n Tuesday \\n\\n \\n\\n They are organizing the Freshman basket-ball team and there\u0027s \\n\\n just a chance that I shall get in it. I\u0027m little of course, \\n\\n but terribly quick and wiry and tough. While the others are hopping \\n\\n about in the air, I can dodge under their feet and grab the ball. \\n\\n It\u0027s loads of fun practising--out in the athletic field in the \\n\\n afternoon with the trees all red and yellow and the air full of \\n\\n the smell of burning leaves, and everybody laughing and shouting. \\n\\n These are the happiest girls I ever saw--and I am the happiest \\n\\n of all! \\n\\n \\n\\n I meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things I\u0027m learning \\n\\n (Mrs. Lippett said you wanted to know), but 7th hour has just rung, \\n\\n and in ten minutes I\u0027m due at the athletic field in gymnasium clothes. \\n\\n Don\u0027t you hope I\u0027ll get in the team? \\n\\n \\n\\n Yours always, \\n\\n Jerusha Abbott \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. (9 o\u0027clock.) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Sallie McBride just poked her head in at my door. This is what \\n\\n she said: \\n\\n \\n\\n `I\u0027m so homesick that I simply can\u0027t stand it. Do you feel that way?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n I smiled a little and said no; I thought I could pull through. \\n\\n At least homesickness is one disease that I\u0027ve escaped! I never heard \\n\\n of anybody being asylum-sick, did you? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59724.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
