{"id":44687,"no":21,"title":"9th June","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Happy day! I\u0027ve just finished my last examination Physiology. \\n\\n And now: \\n\\n \\n\\n Three months on a farm! \\n\\n \\n\\n I don\u0027t know what kind of a thing a farm is. I\u0027ve never been on \\n\\n one in my life. I\u0027ve never even looked at one (except from the car \\n\\n window), but I know I\u0027m going to love it, and I\u0027m going to love \\n\\n being FREE. \\n\\n \\n\\n I am not used even yet to being outside the John Grier Home. \\n\\n Whenever I think of it excited little thrills chase up and down \\n\\n my back. I feel as though I must run faster and faster and keep \\n\\n looking over my shoulder to make sure that Mrs. Lippett isn\u0027t after \\n\\n me with her arm stretched out to grab me back. \\n\\n \\n\\n I don\u0027t have to mind any one this summer, do I? \\n\\n \\n\\n Your nominal authority doesn\u0027t annoy me in the least; you are too \\n\\n far away to do any harm. Mrs. Lippett is dead for ever, so far as I \\n\\n am concerned, and the Semples aren\u0027t expected to overlook my moral \\n\\n welfare, are they? No, I am sure not. I am entirely grown up. Hooray! \\n\\n \\n\\n I leave you now to pack a trunk, and three boxes of teakettles \\n\\n and dishes and sofa cushions and books. \\n\\n Yours ever, \\n\\n Judy \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. Here is my physiology exam. Do you think you could have passed? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59743.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
