Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times. \n Your flowers make the first real, true present I ever received in \n my life. If you want to know what a baby I am I lay down and cried \n because I was so happy. \n \n Now that I am sure you read my letters, I\u0027ll make them much \n more interesting, so they\u0027ll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape \n around them--only please take out that dreadful one and burn it up. \n I\u0027d hate to think that you ever read it over. \n \n Thank you for making a very sick, cross, miserable Freshman cheerful. \n Probably you have lots of loving family and friends, and you don\u0027t \n know what it feels like to be alone. But I do. \n \n Goodbye--I\u0027ll promise never to be horrid again, because now I \n know you\u0027re a real person; also I\u0027ll promise never to bother you \n with any more questions. \n \n Do you still hate girls? \n Yours for ever, \n Judy \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59739.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
