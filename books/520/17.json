{"id":44683,"no":17,"title":"THE INFIRMARY 4th April","content":"Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs, Yesterday evening just towards dark, when I was sitting up in bed looking out at the rain and feeling awfully bored with life in a great institution, the nurse appeared with a long white box addressed to me, and filled with the LOVELIEST pink rosebuds. And much nicer still, it contained a card with a very polite message written in a funny little uphill back hand (but one which shows a great deal of character). Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times. Your flowers make the first real, true present I ever received in my life. If you want to know what a baby I am I lay down and cried because I was so happy. Now that I am sure you read my letters, I\u0027ll make them much more interesting, so they\u0027ll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape around them--only please take out that dreadful one and burn it up. I\u0027d hate to think that you ever read it over. Thank you for making a very sick, cross, miserable Freshman cheerful. Probably you have lots of loving family and friends, and you don\u0027t know what it feels like to be alone. But I do. Goodbye--I\u0027ll promise never to be horrid again, because now I know you\u0027re a real person; also I\u0027ll promise never to bother you with any more questions. Do you still hate girls? Yours for ever, Judy","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59739.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
