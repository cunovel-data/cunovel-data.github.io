{"id":44706,"no":40,"title":"5th June","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Your secretary man has just written to me saying that Mr. Smith \\n\\n prefers that I should not accept Mrs. McBride\u0027s invitation, \\n\\n but should return to Lock Willow the same as last summer. \\n\\n \\n\\n Why, why, WHY, Daddy? \\n\\n \\n\\n You don\u0027t understand about it. Mrs. McBride does want me, \\n\\n really and truly. I\u0027m not the least bit of trouble in the house. \\n\\n I\u0027m a help. They don\u0027t take up many servants, and Sallie an I can do lots \\n\\n of useful things. It\u0027s a fine chance for me to learn housekeeping. \\n\\n Every woman ought to understand it, an I only know asylum-keeping. \\n\\n \\n\\n There aren\u0027t any girls our age at the camp, and Mrs. McBride wants \\n\\n me for a companion for Sallie. We are planning to do a lot of \\n\\n reading together. We are going to read all of the books for next \\n\\n year\u0027s English and sociology. The Professor said it would be a great \\n\\n help if we would get our reading finished in the summer; and it\u0027s \\n\\n so much easier to remember it if we read together and talk it over. \\n\\n \\n\\n Just to live in the same house with Sallie\u0027s mother is an education. \\n\\n She\u0027s the most interesting, entertaining, companionable, charming woman \\n\\n in the world; she knows everything. Think how many summers I\u0027ve \\n\\n spent with Mrs. Lippett and how I\u0027ll appreciate the contrast. \\n\\n You needn\u0027t be afraid that I\u0027ll be crowding them, for their house is \\n\\n made of rubber. When they have a lot of company, they just sprinkle \\n\\n tents about in the woods and turn the boys outside. It\u0027s going to be \\n\\n such a nice, healthy summer exercising out of doors every minute. \\n\\n Jimmie McBride is going to teach me how to ride horseback and paddle \\n\\n a canoe, and how to shoot and--oh, lots of things I ought to know. \\n\\n It\u0027s the kind of nice, jolly, care-free time that I\u0027ve never had; \\n\\n and I think every girl deserves it once in her life. Of course I\u0027ll \\n\\n do exactly as you say, but please, PLEASE let me go, Daddy. I\u0027ve never \\n\\n wanted anything so much. \\n\\n \\n\\n This isn\u0027t Jerusha Abbott, the future great author, writing to you. \\n\\n It\u0027s just Judy--a girl. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59762.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
