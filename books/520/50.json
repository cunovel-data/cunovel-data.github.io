{"id":44716,"no":50,"title":"20th December","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n I\u0027ve just a moment, because I must attend two classes, pack a trunk \n and a suit-case, and catch the four-o\u0027clock train--but I couldn\u0027t \n go without sending a word to let you know how much I appreciate \n my Christmas box. \n \n I love the furs and the necklace and the Liberty scarf and the gloves \n and handkerchiefs and books and purse--and most of all I love you! \n But Daddy, you have no business to spoil me this way. I\u0027m only human-- \n and a girl at that. How can I keep my mind sternly fixed on a \n studious career, when you deflect me with such worldly frivolities? \n \n I have strong suspicions now as to which one of the John Grier \n Trustees used to give the Christmas tree and the Sunday ice-cream. \n He was nameless, but by his works I know him! You deserve to be \n happy for all the good things you do. \n \n Goodbye, and a very merry Christmas. \n Yours always, \n Judy \n \n \n PS. I am sending a slight token, too. Do you think you would \n like her if you knew her? \n \n \n 11th January \n \n I meant to write to you from the city, Daddy, but New York \n is an engrossing place. \n \n I had an interesting--and illuminating--time, but I\u0027m glad I don\u0027t \n belong to such a family! I should truly rather have the John Grier \n Home for a background. Whatever the drawbacks of my bringing up, \n there was at least no pretence about it. I know now what people \n mean when they say they are weighed down by Things. The material \n atmosphere of that house was crushing; I didn\u0027t draw a deep breath \n until I was on an express train coming back. All the furniture \n was carved and upholstered and gorgeous; the people I met were \n beautifully dressed and low-voiced and well-bred, but it\u0027s the truth, \n Daddy, I never heard one word of real talk from the time we arrived \n until we left. I don\u0027t think an idea ever entered the front door. \n \n Mrs. Pendleton never thinks of anything but jewels and dressmakers \n and social engagements. She did seem a different kind of mother from \n Mrs. McBride! If I ever marry and have a family, I\u0027m going to make them \n as exactly like the McBrides as I can. Not for all the money in the \n world would I ever let any children of mine develop into Pendletons. \n Maybe it isn\u0027t polite to criticize people you\u0027ve been visiting? \n If it isn\u0027t, please excuse. This is very confidential, between you \n and me. \n \n I only saw Master Jervie once when he called at tea time, \n and then I didn\u0027t have a chance to speak to him alone. \n It was really disappointing after our nice time last summer. \n I don\u0027t think he cares much for his relatives--and I am sure they \n don\u0027t care much for him! Julia\u0027s mother says he\u0027s unbalanced. \n He\u0027s a Socialist--except, thank Heaven, he doesn\u0027t let his hair grow \n and wear red ties. She can\u0027t imagine where he picked up his queer ideas; \n the family have been Church of England for generations. He throws \n away his money on every sort of crazy reform, instead of spending it \n on such sensible things as yachts and automobiles and polo ponies. \n He does buy candy with it though! He sent Julia and me each a box \n for Christmas. \n \n You know, I think I\u0027ll be a Socialist, too. You wouldn\u0027t mind, \n would you, Daddy? They\u0027re quite different from Anarchists; \n they don\u0027t believe in blowing people up. Probably I am one by rights; \n I belong to the proletariat. I haven\u0027t determined yet just which \n kind I am going to be. I will look into the subject over Sunday, \n and declare my principles in my next. \n \n I\u0027ve seen loads of theatres and hotels and beautiful houses. \n My mind is a confused jumble of onyx and gilding and mosaic floors \n and palms. I\u0027m still pretty breathless but I am glad to get back \n to college and my books--I believe that I really am a student; \n this atmosphere of academic calm I find more bracing than New York. \n College is a very satisfying sort of life; the books and study \n and regular classes keep you alive mentally, and then when your \n mind gets tired, you have the gymnasium and outdoor athletics, \n and always plenty of congenial friends who are thinking about the \n same things you are. We spend a whole evening in nothing but talk-- \n talk--talk--and go to bed with a very uplifted feeling, as though we \n had settled permanently some pressing world problems. And filling \n in every crevice, there is always such a lot of nonsense--just silly \n jokes about the little things that come up but very satisfying. \n We do appreciate our own witticisms! \n \n It isn\u0027t the great big pleasures that count the most; it\u0027s making \n a great deal out of the little ones--I\u0027ve discovered the true \n secret of happiness, Daddy, and that is to live in the now. \n Not to be for ever regretting the past, or anticipating the future; \n but to get the most that you can out of this very instant. \n It\u0027s like farming. You can have extensive farming and intensive \n farming; well, I am going to have intensive living after this. \n I\u0027m going to enjoy every second, and I\u0027m going to KNOW I\u0027m enjoying \n it while I\u0027m enjoying it. Most people don\u0027t live; they just race. \n They are trying to reach some goal far away on the horizon, and in the \n heat of the going they get so breathless and panting that they lose \n all sight of the beautiful, tranquil country they are passing through; \n and then the first thing they know, they are old and worn out, \n and it doesn\u0027t make any difference whether they\u0027ve reached the goal \n or not. I\u0027ve decided to sit down by the way and pile up a lot \n of little happinesses, even if I never become a Great Author. \n Did you ever know such a philosopheress as I am developing into? \n Yours ever, \n Judy \n \n PS. It\u0027s raining cats and dogs tonight. Two puppies and a kitten \n have just landed on the window-sill. \n \n Dear Comrade, \n \n Hooray! I\u0027m a Fabian. \n \n That\u0027s a Socialist who\u0027s willing to wait. We don\u0027t want the social \n revolution to come tomorrow morning; it would be too upsetting. \n We want it to come very gradually in the distant future, when we \n shall all be prepared and able to sustain the shock. \n \n In the meantime, we must be getting ready, by instituting industrial, \n educational and orphan asylum reforms. \n Yours, with fraternal love, \n Judy \n Monday, 3rd hour \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59772.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
