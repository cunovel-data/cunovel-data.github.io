{"id":44721,"no":55,"title":"4th June","content":"Dear Daddy, Very busy time--commencement in ten days, examinations tomorrow; lots of studying, lots of packing, and the outdoor world so lovely that it hurts you to stay inside. But never mind, vacation\u0027s coming. Julia is going abroad this summer-- it makes the fourth time. No doubt about it, Daddy, goods are not distributed evenly. Sallie, as usual, goes to the Adirondacks. And what do you think I am going to do? You may have three guesses. Lock Willow? Wrong. The Adirondacks with Sallie? Wrong. (I\u0027ll never attempt that again; I was discouraged last year.) Can\u0027t you guess anything else? You\u0027re not very inventive. I\u0027ll tell you, Daddy, if you\u0027ll promise not to make a lot of objections. I warn your secretary in advance that my mind is made up. I am going to spend the summer at the seaside with a Mrs. Charles Paterson and tutor her daughter who is to enter college in the autumn. I met her through the McBrides, and she is a very charming woman. I am to give lessons in English and Latin to the younger daughter, too, but I shall have a little time to myself, and I shall be earning fifty dollars a month! Doesn\u0027t that impress you as a perfectly exorbitant amount? She offered it; I should have blushed to ask for more than twenty-five. I finish at Magnolia (that\u0027s where she lives) the first of September, and shall probably spend the remaining three weeks at Lock Willow-- I should like to see the Semples again and all the friendly animals. How does my programme strike you, Daddy? I am getting quite independent, you see. You have put me on my feet and I think I can almost walk alone by now. Princeton commencement and our examinations exactly coincide-- which is an awful blow. Sallie and I did so want to get away in time for it, but of course that is utterly impossible. Goodbye, Daddy. Have a nice summer and come back in the autumn rested and ready for another year of work. (That\u0027s what you ought to be writing to me!) I haven\u0027t any idea what you do in the summer, or how you amuse yourself. I can\u0027t visualize your surroundings. Do you play golf or hunt or ride horseback or just sit in the sun and meditate? Anyway, whatever it is, have a good time and don\u0027t forget Judy. 10th June Dear Daddy, This is the hardest letter I ever wrote, but I have decided what I must do, and there isn\u0027t going to be any turning back. It is very sweet and generous and dear of you to wish to send me to Europe this summer--for the moment I was intoxicated by the idea; but sober second thoughts said no. It would be rather illogical of me to refuse to take your money for college, and then use it instead just for amusement! You mustn\u0027t get me used to too many luxuries. One doesn\u0027t miss what one has never had; but it\u0027s awfully hard going without things after one has commenced thinking they are his-- hers (English language needs another pronoun) by natural right. Living with Sallie and Julia is an awful strain on my stoical philosophy. They have both had things from the time they were babies; they accept happiness as a matter of course. The World, they think, owes them everything they want. Maybe the World does--in any case, it seems to acknowledge the debt and pay up. But as for me, it owes me nothing, and distinctly told me so in the beginning. I have no right to borrow on credit, for there will come a time when the World will repudiate my claim. I seem to be floundering in a sea of metaphor--but I hope you grasp my meaning? Anyway, I have a very strong feeling that the only honest thing for me to do is to teach this summer and begin to support myself. MAGNOLIA, Four days later I\u0027d got just that much written, when--what do you think happened? The maid arrived with Master Jervie\u0027s card. He is going abroad too this summer; not with Julia and her family, but entirely by himself I told him that you had invited me to go with a lady who is chaperoning a party of girls. He knows about you, Daddy. That is, he knows that my father and mother are dead, and that a kind gentleman is sending me to college; I simply didn\u0027t have the courage to tell him about the John Grier Home and all the rest. He thinks that you are my guardian and a perfectly legitimate old family friend. I have never told him that I didn\u0027t know you--that would seem too queer! Anyway, he insisted on my going to Europe. He said that it was a necessary part of my education and that I mustn\u0027t think of refusing. Also, that he would be in Paris at the same time, and that we would run away from the chaperon occasionally and have dinner together at nice, funny, foreign restaurants. Well, Daddy, it did appeal to me! I almost weakened; if he hadn\u0027t been so dictatorial, maybe I should have entirely weakened. I can be enticed step by step, but I WON\u0027T be forced. He said I was a silly, foolish, irrational, quixotic, idiotic, stubborn child (those are a few of his abusive adjectives; the rest escape me), and that I didn\u0027t know what was good for me; I ought to let older people judge. We almost quarrelled--I am not sure but that we entirely did! In any case, I packed my trunk fast and came up here. I thought I\u0027d better see my bridges in flames behind me before I finished writing to you. They are entirely reduced to ashes now. Here I am at Cliff Top (the name of Mrs. Paterson\u0027s cottage) with my trunk unpacked and Florence (the little one) already struggling with first declension nouns. And it bids fair to be a struggle! She is a most uncommonly spoiled child; I shall have to teach her first how to study--she has never in her life concentrated on anything more difficult than ice-cream soda water. We use a quiet corner of the cliffs for a schoolroom--Mrs. Paterson wishes me to keep them out of doors--and I will say that I find it difficult to concentrate with the blue sea before me and ships a-sailing by! And when I think I might be on one, sailing off to foreign lands-- but I WON\u0027T let myself think of anything but Latin Grammar. The prepositions a or ab, absque, coram, cum, de e or ex, prae, pro, sine, tenus, in, subter, sub and super govern the ablative. So you see, Daddy, I am already plunged into work with my eyes persistently set against temptation. Don\u0027t be cross with me, please, and don\u0027t think that I do not appreciate your kindness, for I do--always--always. The only way I can ever repay you is by turning out a Very Useful Citizen (Are women citizens? I don\u0027t suppose they are.) Anyway, a Very Useful Person. And when you look at me you can say, `I gave that Very Useful Person to the world.\u0027 That sounds well, doesn\u0027t it, Daddy? But I don\u0027t wish to mislead you. The feeling often comes over me that I am not at all remarkable; it is fun to plan a career, but in all probability I shan\u0027t turn out a bit different from any other ordinary person. I may end by marrying an undertaker and being an inspiration to him in his work.
