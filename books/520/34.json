And she\u0027s a Sophomore! \n The contestants are mostly Seniors. When I saw my name posted, \n I couldn\u0027t quite believe it was true. Maybe I am going to be an author \n after all. I wish Mrs. Lippett hadn\u0027t given me such a silly name-- \n it sounds like an author-ess, doesn\u0027t it? \n \n Also I have been chosen for the spring dramatics--As You Like It \n out of doors. I am going to be Celia, own cousin to Rosalind. \n \n And lastly: Julia and Sallie and I are going to New York next Friday \n to do some spring shopping and stay all night and go to the theatre \n the next day with `Master Jervie.\u0027 He invited us. Julia is going \n to stay at home with her family, but Sallie and I are going to stop \n at the Martha Washington Hotel. Did you ever hear of anything \n so exciting? I\u0027ve never been in a hotel in my life, nor in a theatre; \n except once when the Catholic Church had a festival and invited \n the orphans, but that wasn\u0027t a real play and it doesn\u0027t count. \n \n And what do you think we\u0027re going to see? Hamlet. Think of that! \n We studied it for four weeks in Shakespeare class and I know it \n by heart. \n \n I am so excited over all these prospects that I can scarcely sleep. \n \n Goodbye, Daddy. \n \n This is a very entertaining world. \n Yours ever, \n Judy \n \n \n PS. I\u0027ve just looked at the calendar. It\u0027s the 28th. \n \n Another postscript. \n \n I saw a street car conductor today with one brown eye and one blue. \n Wouldn\u0027t he make a nice villain for a detective story? \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59756.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
