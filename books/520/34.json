{"id":44700,"no":34,"title":"24th March, maybe the 25th","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, I don\u0027t believe I can be going to Heaven--I am getting such a lot of good things here; it wouldn\u0027t be fair to get them hereafter too. Listen to what has happened. Jerusha Abbott has won the short-story contest (a twenty-five dollar prize) that the Monthly holds every year. And she\u0027s a Sophomore! The contestants are mostly Seniors. When I saw my name posted, I couldn\u0027t quite believe it was true. Maybe I am going to be an author after all. I wish Mrs. Lippett hadn\u0027t given me such a silly name-- it sounds like an author-ess, doesn\u0027t it? Also I have been chosen for the spring dramatics--As You Like It out of doors. I am going to be Celia, own cousin to Rosalind. And lastly: Julia and Sallie and I are going to New York next Friday to do some spring shopping and stay all night and go to the theatre the next day with `Master Jervie.\u0027 He invited us. Julia is going to stay at home with her family, but Sallie and I are going to stop at the Martha Washington Hotel. Did you ever hear of anything so exciting? I\u0027ve never been in a hotel in my life, nor in a theatre; except once when the Catholic Church had a festival and invited the orphans, but that wasn\u0027t a real play and it doesn\u0027t count. And what do you think we\u0027re going to see? Hamlet. Think of that! We studied it for four weeks in Shakespeare class and I know it by heart. I am so excited over all these prospects that I can scarcely sleep. Goodbye, Daddy. This is a very entertaining world. Yours ever, Judy PS. I\u0027ve just looked at the calendar. It\u0027s the 28th. Another postscript. I saw a street car conductor today with one brown eye and one blue. Wouldn\u0027t he make a nice villain for a detective story?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59756.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
