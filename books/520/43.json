{"id":44709,"no":43,"title":"10th August","content":"Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n SIR: I address you from the second crotch in the willow tree \n by the pool in the pasture. There\u0027s a frog croaking underneath, \n a locust singing overhead and two little `devil downheads\u0027 \n darting up and down the trunk. I\u0027ve been here for an hour; \n it\u0027s a very comfortable crotch, especially after being upholstered \n with two sofa cushions. I came up with a pen and tablet hoping to \n write an immortal short story, but I\u0027ve been having a dreadful time \n with my heroine--I CAN\u0027T make her behave as I want her to behave; \n so I\u0027ve abandoned her for the moment, and am writing to you. \n (Not much relief though, for I can\u0027t make you behave as I want \n you to, either.) \n \n If you are in that dreadful New York, I wish I could send you some \n of this lovely, breezy, sunshiny outlook. The country is Heaven \n after a week of rain. \n \n Speaking of Heaven--do you remember Mr. Kellogg that I told you about \n last summer?--the minister of the little white church at the Corners. \n Well, the poor old soul is dead--last winter of pneumonia. I went \n half a dozen times to hear him preach and got very well acquainted \n with his theology. He believed to the end exactly the same things \n he started with. It seems to me that a man who can think straight \n along for forty-seven years without changing a single idea ought to \n be kept in a cabinet as a curiosity. I hope he is enjoying his harp \n and golden crown; he was so perfectly sure of finding them! There\u0027s a \n new young man, very consequential, in his place. The congregation \n is pretty dubious, especially the faction led by Deacon Cummings. \n It looks as though there was going to be an awful split in the church. \n We don\u0027t care for innovations in religion in this neighbourhood. \n \n During our week of rain I sat up in the attic and had an orgy \n of reading--Stevenson, mostly. He himself is more entertaining \n than any of the characters in his books; I dare say he made himself \n into the kind of hero that would look well in print. Don\u0027t you \n think it was perfect of him to spend all the ten thousand dollars \n his father left, for a yacht, and go sailing off to the South Seas? \n He lived up to his adventurous creed. If my father had left me ten \n thousand dollars, I\u0027d do it, too. The thought of Vailima makes \n me wild. I want to see the tropics. I want to see the whole world. \n I am going to be a great author, or artist, or actress, or playwright-- \n or whatever sort of a great person I turn out to be. I have a \n terrible wanderthirst; the very sight of a map makes me want to put \n on my hat and take an umbrella and start. `I shall see before I die \n the palms and temples of the South.\u0027 \n \n \n \n Thursday evening at twilight, \n sitting on the doorstep. \n \n Very hard to get any news into this letter! Judy is becoming \n so philosophical of late, that she wishes to discourse largely \n of the world in general, instead of descending to the trivial \n details of daily life. But if you MUST have news, here it is: \n \n Our nine young pigs waded across the brook and ran away last Tuesday, \n and only eight came back. We don\u0027t want to accuse anyone unjustly, \n but we suspect that Widow Dowd has one more than she ought to have. \n \n Mr. Weaver has painted his barn and his two silos a bright pumpkin yellow-- \n a very ugly colour, but he says it will wear. \n \n The Brewers have company this week; Mrs. Brewer\u0027s sister and two \n nieces from Ohio. \n \n One of our Rhode Island Reds only brought off three chicks \n out of fifteen eggs. We can\u0027t imagine what was the trouble. \n Rhode island Reds, in my opinion, are a very inferior breed. \n I prefer Buff Orpingtons. \n \n The new clerk in the post office at Bonnyrigg Four Corners drank \n every drop of Jamaica ginger they had in stock--seven dollars\u0027 \n worth--before he was discovered. \n \n Old Ira Hatch has rheumatism and can\u0027t work any more; he never saved \n his money when he was earning good wages, so now he has to live \n on the town. \n \n There\u0027s to be an ice-cream social at the schoolhouse next \n Saturday evening. Come and bring your families. \n \n I have a new hat that I bought for twenty-five cents at the post office. \n This is my latest portrait, on my way to rake the hay. \n \n It\u0027s getting too dark to see; anyway, the news is all used up. \n Good night, \n Judy \n \n \n \n Friday \n \n Good morning! Here is some news! What do you think? You\u0027d never, \n never, never guess who\u0027s coming to Lock Willow. A letter to Mrs. \n Semple from Mr. Pendleton. He\u0027s motoring through the Berkshires, \n and is tired and wants to rest on a nice quiet farm--if he climbs \n out at her doorstep some night will she have a room ready for him? \n Maybe he\u0027ll stay one week, or maybe two, or maybe three; he\u0027ll see \n how restful it is when he gets here. \n \n Such a flutter as we are in! The whole house is being cleaned and \n all the curtains washed. I am driving to the Corners this morning \n to get some new oilcloth for the entry, and two cans of brown floor \n paint for the hall and back stairs. Mrs. Dowd is engaged to come \n tomorrow to wash the windows (in the exigency of the moment, we waive \n our suspicions in regard to the piglet). You might think, from this \n account of our activities, that the house was not already immaculate; \n but I assure you it was! Whatever Mrs. Semple\u0027s limitations, \n she is a HOUSEKEEPER. \n \n But isn\u0027t it just like a man, Daddy? He doesn\u0027t give the remotest \n hint as to whether he will land on the doorstep today, or two weeks \n from today. We shall live in a perpetual breathlessness until he comes-- \n and if he doesn\u0027t hurry, the cleaning may all have to be done over again. \n \n There\u0027s Amasai waiting below with the buckboard and Grover. \n I drive alone--but if you could see old Grove, you wouldn\u0027t be \n worried as to my safety. \n \n With my hand on my heart--farewell. \n Judy \n \n \n PS. Isn\u0027t that a nice ending? I got it out of Stevenson\u0027s \n letters. \n \n \n \n Saturday Good \n morning again! I didn\u0027t get this ENVELOPED yesterday before \n the postman came, so I\u0027ll add some more. We have one mail a day \n at twelve o\u0027clock. Rural delivery is a blessing to the farmers! \n Our postman not only delivers letters, but he runs errands for us \n in town, at five cents an errand. Yesterday he brought me some \n shoe-strings and a jar of cold cream (I sunburned all the skin \n off my nose before I got my new hat) and a blue Windsor tie and a \n bottle of blacking all for ten cents. That was an unusual bargain, \n owing to the largeness of my order. \n \n Also he tells us what is happening in the Great World. \n Several people on the route take daily papers, and he reads them as he \n jogs along, and repeats the news to the ones who don\u0027t subscribe. \n So in case a war breaks out between the United States and Japan, \n or the president is assassinated, or Mr. Rockefeller leaves a million \n dollars to the John Grier Home, you needn\u0027t bother to write; \n I\u0027ll hear it anyway. \n \n No sign yet of Master Jervie. But you should see how clean our \n house is--and with what anxiety we wipe our feet before we step in! \n \n I hope he\u0027ll come soon; I am longing for someone to talk to. \n Mrs. Semple, to tell you the truth, gets rather monotonous. \n She never lets ideas interrupt the easy flow of her conversation. \n It\u0027s a funny thing about the people here. Their world is just \n this single hilltop. They are not a bit universal, if you know \n what I mean. It\u0027s exactly the same as at the John Grier Home. \n Our ideas there were bounded by the four sides of the iron fence, \n only I didn\u0027t mind it so much because I was younger, and was so \n awfully busy. By the time I\u0027d got all my beds made and my babies\u0027 \n faces washed and had gone to school and come home and had washed their \n faces again and darned their stockings and mended Freddie Perkins\u0027s \n trousers (he tore them every day of his life) and learned my lessons \n in between--I was ready to go to bed, and I didn\u0027t notice any lack \n of social intercourse. But after two years in a conversational college, \n I do miss it; and I shall be glad to see somebody who speaks \n my language. \n \n I really believe I\u0027ve finished, Daddy. Nothing else occurs to me \n at the moment--I\u0027ll try to write a longer letter next time. \n Yours always, \n Judy \n \n \n PS. The lettuce hasn\u0027t done at all well this year. It was so dry \n early in the season. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59765.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
