{"id":44736,"no":70,"title":"LOCK WILLOW, 3rd October","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n Your note written in your own hand--and a pretty wobbly hand!-- \n came this morning. I am so sorry that you have been ill; I wouldn\u0027t \n have bothered you with my affairs if I had known. Yes, I will tell you \n the trouble, but it\u0027s sort of complicated to write, and VERY PRIVATE. \n Please don\u0027t keep this letter, but burn it. \n \n Before I begin--here\u0027s a cheque for one thousand dollars. \n It seems funny, doesn\u0027t it, for me to be sending a cheque to you? \n Where do you think I got it? \n \n I\u0027ve sold my story, Daddy. It\u0027s going to be published serially \n in seven parts, and then in a book! You might think I\u0027d be wild \n with joy, but I\u0027m not. I\u0027m entirely apathetic. Of course I\u0027m glad \n to begin paying you--I owe you over two thousand more. It\u0027s coming \n in instalments. Now don\u0027t be horrid, please, about taking it, \n because it makes me happy to return it. I owe you a great deal \n more than the mere money, and the rest I will continue to pay all \n my life in gratitude and affection. \n \n And now, Daddy, about the other thing; please give me your most \n worldly advice, whether you think I\u0027ll like it or not. \n \n You know that I\u0027ve always had a very special feeling towards you; \n you sort of represented my whole family; but you won\u0027t mind, will you, \n if I tell you that I have a very much more special feeling for \n another man? You can probably guess without much trouble who he is. \n I suspect that my letters have been very full of Master Jervie for a \n very long time. \n \n I wish I could make you understand what he is like and how entirely \n companionable we are. We think the same about everything-- \n I am afraid I have a tendency to make over my ideas to match his! \n But he is almost always right; he ought to be, you know, \n for he has fourteen years\u0027 start of me. In other ways, though, \n he\u0027s just an overgrown boy, and he does need looking after-- \n he hasn\u0027t any sense about wearing rubbers when it rains. He and I \n always think the same things are funny, and that is such a lot; \n it\u0027s dreadful when two people\u0027s senses of humour are antagonistic. \n I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s any bridging that gulf! \n \n And he is--Oh, well! He is just himself, and I miss him, and miss him, \n and miss him. The whole world seems empty and aching. I hate the \n moonlight because it\u0027s beautiful and he isn\u0027t here to see it with me. \n But maybe you\u0027ve loved somebody, too, and you know? If you have, \n I don\u0027t need to explain; if you haven\u0027t, I can\u0027t explain. \n \n Anyway, that\u0027s the way I feel--and I\u0027ve refused to marry him. \n \n I didn\u0027t tell him why; I was just dumb and miserable. I couldn\u0027t \n think of anything to say. And now he has gone away imagining \n that I want to marry Jimmie McBride--I don\u0027t in the least, \n I wouldn\u0027t think of marrying Jimmie; he isn\u0027t grown up enough. \n But Master Jervie and I got into a dreadful muddle of misunderstanding \n and we both hurt each other\u0027s feelings. The reason I sent him \n away was not because I didn\u0027t care for him, but because I cared \n for him so much. I was afraid he would regret it in the future-- \n and I couldn\u0027t stand that! It didn\u0027t seem right for a person \n of my lack of antecedents to marry into any such family as his. \n I never told him about the orphan asylum, and I hated to explain \n that I didn\u0027t know who I was. I may be DREADFUL, you know. \n And his family are proud--and I\u0027m proud, too! \n \n Also, I felt sort of bound to you. After having been educated \n to be a writer, I must at least try to be one; it would scarcely \n be fair to accept your education and then go off and not use it. \n But now that I am going to be able to pay back the money, I feel \n that I have partially discharged that debt--besides, I suppose I could \n keep on being a writer even if I did marry. The two professions \n are not necessarily exclusive. \n \n I\u0027ve been thinking very hard about it. Of course he is a Socialist, \n and he has unconventional ideas; maybe he wouldn\u0027t mind marrying into \n the proletariat so much as some men might. Perhaps when two people are \n exactly in accord, and always happy when together and lonely when apart, \n they ought not to let anything in the world stand between them. \n Of course I WANT to believe that! But I\u0027d like to get your \n unemotional opinion. You probably belong to a Family also, and will \n look at it from a worldly point of view and not just a sympathetic, \n human point of view--so you see how brave I am to lay it before you. \n \n Suppose I go to him and explain that the trouble isn\u0027t Jimmie, \n but is the John Grier Home--would that be a dreadful thing for me \n to do? It would take a great deal of courage. I\u0027d almost rather \n be miserable for the rest of my life. \n \n This happened nearly two months ago; I haven\u0027t heard a word from him \n since he was here. I was just getting sort of acclimated to the \n feeling of a broken heart, when a letter came from Julia that stirred \n me all up again. She said--very casually--that `Uncle Jervis\u0027 \n had been caught out all night in a storm when he was hunting in Canada, \n and had been ill ever since with pneumonia. And I never knew it. \n I was feeling hurt because he had just disappeared into blankness \n without a word. I think he\u0027s pretty unhappy, and I know I am! \n \n What seems to you the right thing for me to do? \n Judy \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59792.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
