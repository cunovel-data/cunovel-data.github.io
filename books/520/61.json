{"id":44727,"no":61,"title":"26th December","content":"My Dear, Dear, Daddy, Haven\u0027t you any sense? Don\u0027t you KNOW that you mustn\u0027t give one girl seventeen Christmas presents? I\u0027m a Socialist, please remember; do you wish to turn me into a Plutocrat? Think how embarrassing it would be if we should ever quarrel! I should have to engage a moving-van to return your gifts. I am sorry that the necktie I sent was so wobbly; I knit it with my own hands (as you doubtless discovered from internal evidence). You will have to wear it on cold days and keep your coat buttoned up tight. Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times. I think you\u0027re the sweetest man that ever lived--and the foolishest! Judy Here\u0027s a four-leaf clover from Camp McBride to bring you good luck for the New Year. 9th January Do you wish to do something, Daddy, that will ensure your eternal salvation? There is a family here who are in awfully desperate straits. A mother and father and four visible children-- the two older boys have disappeared into the world to make their fortune and have not sent any of it back. The father worked in a glass factory and got consumption--it\u0027s awfully unhealthy work-- and now has been sent away to a hospital. That took all their savings, and the support of the family falls upon the oldest daughter, who is twenty-four. She dressmakes for $1.50 a day (when she can get it) and embroiders centrepieces in the evening. The mother isn\u0027t very strong and is extremely ineffectual and pious. She sits with her hands folded, a picture of patient resignation, while the daughter kills herself with overwork and responsibility and worry; she doesn\u0027t see how they are going to get through the rest of the winter--and I don\u0027t either. One hundred dollars would buy some coal and some shoes for three children so that they could go to school, and give a little margin so that she needn\u0027t worry herself to death when a few days pass and she doesn\u0027t get work. You are the richest man I know. Don\u0027t you suppose you could spare one hundred dollars? That girl deserves help a lot more than I ever did. I wouldn\u0027t ask it except for the girl; I don\u0027t care much what happens to the mother--she is such a jelly-fish. The way people are for ever rolling their eyes to heaven and saying, `Perhaps it\u0027s all for the best,\u0027 when they are perfectly dead sure it\u0027s not, makes me enraged. Humility or resignation or whatever you choose to call it, is simply impotent inertia. I\u0027m for a more militant religion! We are getting the most dreadful lessons in philosophy--all of Schopenhauer for tomorrow. The professor doesn\u0027t seem to realize that we are taking any other subject. He\u0027s a queer old duck; he goes about with his head in the clouds and blinks dazedly when occasionally he strikes solid earth. He tries to lighten his lectures with an occasional witticism--and we do our best to smile, but I assure you his jokes are no laughing matter. He spends his entire time between classes in trying to figure out whether matter really exists or whether he only thinks it exists. I\u0027m sure my sewing girl hasn\u0027t any doubt but that it exists! Where do you think my new novel is? In the waste-basket. I can see myself that it\u0027s no good on earth, and when a loving author realizes that, what WOULD be the judgment of a critical public? Later I address you, Daddy, from a bed of pain. For two days I\u0027ve been laid up with swollen tonsils; I can just swallow hot milk, and that is all. `What were your parents thinking of not to have those tonsils out when you were a baby?\u0027 the doctor wished to know. I\u0027m sure I haven\u0027t an idea, but I doubt if they were thinking much about me. Yours, J. A. Next morning I just read this over before sealing it. I don\u0027t know WHY I cast such a misty atmosphere over life. I hasten to assure you that I am young and happy and exuberant; and I trust you are the same. Youth has nothing to do with birthdays, only with ALIVEDNESS of spirit, so even if your hair is grey, Daddy, you can still be a boy.
