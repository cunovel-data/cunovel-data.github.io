{"id":44676,"no":10,"title":"Exact date unknown","content":"Towards the end of \\n\\n the Christmas vacation. \\n\\n Exact date unknown \\n\\n \\n\\n Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Is it snowing where you are? All the world that I see from my tower \\n\\n is draped in white and the flakes are coming down as big as pop-corns. \\n\\n It\u0027s late afternoon--the sun is just setting (a cold yellow colour) \\n\\n behind some colder violet hills, and I am up in my window seat \\n\\n using the last light to write to you. \\n\\n \\n\\n Your five gold pieces were a surprise! I\u0027m not used to receiving \\n\\n Christmas presents. You have already given me such lots of things-- \\n\\n everything I have, you know--that I don\u0027t quite feel that I \\n\\n deserve extras. But I like them just the same. Do you want to know \\n\\n what I bought with my money? \\n\\n \\n\\n I. A silver watch in a leather case to wear on my wrist and get me \\n\\n to recitations in time. \\n\\n \\n\\n II. Matthew Arnold\u0027s poems. \\n\\n \\n\\n III. A hot water bottle. \\n\\n \\n\\n IV. A steamer rug. (My tower is cold.) \\n\\n \\n\\n V. Five hundred sheets of yellow manuscript paper. (I\u0027m going \\n\\n to commence being an author pretty soon.) \\n\\n \\n\\n VI. A dictionary of synonyms. (To enlarge the author\u0027s vocabulary.) \\n\\n \\n\\n VII. (I don\u0027t much like to confess this last item, but I will.) \\n\\n A pair of silk stockings. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now, Daddy, never say I don\u0027t tell all! \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a very low motive, if you must know it, that prompted the \\n\\n silk stockings. Julia Pendleton comes into my room to do geometry, \\n\\n and she sits cross-legged on the couch and wears silk stockings \\n\\n every night. But just wait--as soon as she gets back from vacation \\n\\n I shall go in and sit on her couch in my silk stockings. You see, \\n\\n Daddy, the miserable creature that I am but at least I\u0027m honest; \\n\\n and you knew already, from my asylum record, that I wasn\u0027t perfect, \\n\\n didn\u0027t you? \\n\\n \\n\\n To recapitulate (that\u0027s the way the English instructor begins every \\n\\n other sentence), I am very much obliged for my seven presents. \\n\\n I\u0027m pretending to myself that they came in a box from my family \\n\\n in California. The watch is from father, the rug from mother, \\n\\n the hot water bottle from grandmother who is always worrying for fear \\n\\n I shall catch cold in this climate--and the yellow paper from my \\n\\n little brother Harry. My sister Isabel gave me the silk stockings, \\n\\n and Aunt Susan the Matthew Arnold poems; Uncle Harry (little Harry is \\n\\n named after him) gave me the dictionary. He wanted to send chocolates, \\n\\n but I insisted on synonyms. \\n\\n \\n\\n You don\u0027t object, do you, to playing the part of a composite family? \\n\\n \\n\\n And now, shall I tell you about my vacation, or are you only interested \\n\\n in my education as such? I hope you appreciate the delicate shade \\n\\n of meaning in `as such\u0027. It is the latest addition to my vocabulary. \\n\\n \\n\\n The girl from Texas is named Leonora Fenton. (Almost as funny \\n\\n as Jerusha, isn\u0027t it?) I like her, but not so much as Sallie McBride; \\n\\n I shall never like any one so much as Sallie--except you. I must \\n\\n always like you the best of all, because you\u0027re my whole family \\n\\n rolled into one. Leonora and I and two Sophomores have walked \u0027cross \\n\\n country every pleasant day and explored the whole neighbourhood, \\n\\n dressed in short skirts and knit jackets and caps, and carrying shiny \\n\\n sticks to whack things with. Once we walked into town--four miles-- \\n\\n and stopped at a restaurant where the college girls go for dinner. \\n\\n Broiled lobster (35 cents), and for dessert, buckwheat cakes and maple \\n\\n syrup (15 cents). Nourishing and cheap. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was such a lark! Especially for me, because it was so awfully \\n\\n different from the asylum--I feel like an escaped convict every \\n\\n time I leave the campus. Before I thought, I started to tell \\n\\n the others what an experience I was having. The cat was almost \\n\\n out of the bag when I grabbed it by its tail and pulled it back. \\n\\n It\u0027s awfully hard for me not to tell everything I know. I\u0027m a very \\n\\n confiding soul by nature; if I didn\u0027t have you to tell things to, \\n\\n I\u0027d burst. \\n\\n \\n\\n We had a molasses candy pull last Friday evening, given by the \\n\\n house matron of Fergussen to the left-behinds in the other halls. \\n\\n There were twenty-two of us altogether, Freshmen and Sophomores and \\n\\n juniors and Seniors all united in amicable accord. The kitchen is huge, \\n\\n with copper pots and kettles hanging in rows on the stone wall-- \\n\\n the littlest casserole among them about the size of a wash boiler. \\n\\n Four hundred girls live in Fergussen. The chef, in a white cap \\n\\n and apron, fetched out twenty-two other white caps and aprons-- \\n\\n I can\u0027t imagine where he got so many--and we all turned ourselves \\n\\n into cooks. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was great fun, though I have seen better candy. When it was \\n\\n finally finished, and ourselves and the kitchen and the door-knobs \\n\\n all thoroughly sticky, we organized a procession and still in our \\n\\n caps and aprons, each carrying a big fork or spoon or frying pan, \\n\\n we marched through the empty corridors to the officers\u0027 parlour, \\n\\n where half-a-dozen professors and instructors were passing \\n\\n a tranquil evening. We serenaded them with college songs and \\n\\n offered refreshments. They accepted politely but dubiously. \\n\\n We left them sucking chunks of molasses candy, sticky and speechless. \\n\\n \\n\\n So you see, Daddy, my education progresses! \\n\\n \\n\\n Don\u0027t you really think that I ought to be an artist instead \\n\\n of an author? \\n\\n \\n\\n Vacation will be over in two days and I shall be glad to see the \\n\\n girls again. My tower is just a trifle lonely; when nine people occupy \\n\\n a house that was built for four hundred, they do rattle around a bit. \\n\\n \\n\\n Eleven pages--poor Daddy, you must be tired! I meant this to be \\n\\n just a short little thank-you note--but when I get started I seem \\n\\n to have a ready pen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Goodbye, and thank you for thinking of me--I should be perfectly \\n\\n happy except for one little threatening cloud on the horizon. \\n\\n Examinations come in February. \\n\\n Yours with love, \\n\\n Judy \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. Maybe it isn\u0027t proper to send love? If it isn\u0027t, please excuse. \\n\\n But I must love somebody and there\u0027s only you and Mrs. Lippett \\n\\n to choose between, so you see--you\u0027ll HAVE to put up with it, \\n\\n Daddy dear, because I can\u0027t love her. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59732.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
