{"id":44708,"no":42,"title":"LOCK WILLOW FARM, 3rd August","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n It has been nearly two months since I wrote, which wasn\u0027t nice of me, \\n\\n I know, but I haven\u0027t loved you much this summer--you see I\u0027m \\n\\n being frank! \\n\\n \\n\\n You can\u0027t imagine how disappointed I was at having to give up \\n\\n the McBrides\u0027 camp. Of course I know that you\u0027re my guardian, \\n\\n and that I have to regard your wishes in all matters, but I couldn\u0027t \\n\\n see any REASON. It was so distinctly the best thing that could \\n\\n have happened to me. If I had been Daddy, and you had been Judy, \\n\\n I should have said, `Bless yo my child, run along and have a \\n\\n good time; see lots of new people and learn lots of new things; \\n\\n live out of doors, and get strong and well and rested for a year \\n\\n of hard work.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n But not at all! Just a curt line from your secretary ordering me \\n\\n to Lock Willow. \\n\\n \\n\\n It\u0027s the impersonality of your commands that hurts my feelings. \\n\\n It seems as though, if you felt the tiniest little bit for me the \\n\\n way I feel for you, you\u0027d sometimes send me a message that you\u0027d \\n\\n written with your own hand, instead of those beastly typewritten \\n\\n secretary\u0027s notes. If there were the slightest hint that you cared, \\n\\n I\u0027d do anything on earth to please you. \\n\\n \\n\\n I know that I was to write nice, long, detailed letters without ever \\n\\n expecting any answer. You\u0027re living up to your side of the bargain-- \\n\\n I\u0027m being educated--and I suppose you\u0027re thinking I\u0027m not living up \\n\\n to mine! \\n\\n \\n\\n But, Daddy, it is a hard bargain. It is, really. I\u0027m so awfully lonely. \\n\\n You are the only person I have to care for, and you are so shadowy. \\n\\n You\u0027re just an imaginary man that I\u0027ve made up--and probably \\n\\n the real YOU isn\u0027t a bit like my imaginary YOU. But you did once, \\n\\n when I was ill in the infirmary, send me a message, and now, \\n\\n when I am feeling awfully forgotten, I get out your card and read \\n\\n it over. \\n\\n \\n\\n I don\u0027t think I am telling you at all what I started to say, \\n\\n which was this: \\n\\n \\n\\n Although my feelings are still hurt, for it is very humiliating \\n\\n to be picked up and moved about by an arbitrary, peremptory, \\n\\n unreasonable, omnipotent, invisible Providence, still, when a man \\n\\n has been as kind and generous and thoughtful as you have heretofore \\n\\n been towards me, I suppose he has a right to be an arbitrary, \\n\\n peremptory, unreasonable, invisible Providence if he chooses, and so-- \\n\\n I\u0027ll forgive you and be cheerful again. But I still don\u0027t enjoy \\n\\n getting Sallie\u0027s letters about the good times they are having in camp! \\n\\n \\n\\n However--we will draw a veil over that and begin again. \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027ve been writing and writing this summer; four short stories \\n\\n finished and sent to four different magazines. So you see I\u0027m \\n\\n trying to be an author. I have a workroom fixed in a corner of the \\n\\n attic where Master Jervie used to have his rainy-day playroom. \\n\\n It\u0027s in a cool, breezy corner with two dormer windows, and shaded \\n\\n by a maple tree with a family of red squirrels living in a hole. \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027ll write a nicer letter in a few days and tell you all the farm news. \\n\\n \\n\\n We need rain. \\n\\n Yours as ever, \\n\\n Judy \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59764.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
