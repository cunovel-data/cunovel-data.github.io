{"id":44733,"no":67,"title":"24th July","content":"Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs, Isn\u0027t it fun to work--or don\u0027t you ever do it? It\u0027s especially fun when your kind of work is the thing you\u0027d rather do more than anything else in the world. I\u0027ve been writing as fast as my pen would go every day this summer, and my only quarrel with life is that the days aren\u0027t long enough to write all the beautiful and valuable and entertaining thoughts I\u0027m thinking. I\u0027ve finished the second draft of my book and am going to begin the third tomorrow morning at half-past seven. It\u0027s the sweetest book you ever saw--it is, truly. I think of nothing else. I can barely wait in the morning to dress and eat before beginning; then I write and write and write till suddenly I\u0027m so tired that I\u0027m limp all over. Then I go out with Colin (the new sheep dog) and romp through the fields and get a fresh supply of ideas for the next day. It\u0027s the most beautiful book you ever saw--Oh, pardon--I said that before. You don\u0027t think me conceited, do you, Daddy dear? I\u0027m not, really, only just now I\u0027m in the enthusiastic stage. Maybe later on I\u0027ll get cold and critical and sniffy. No, I\u0027m sure I won\u0027t! This time I\u0027ve written a real book. Just wait till you see it. I\u0027ll try for a minute to talk about something else. I never told you, did I, that Amasai and Carrie got married last May? They are still working here, but so far as I can see it has spoiled them both. She used to laugh when he tramped in mud or dropped ashes on the floor, but now--you should hear her scold! And she doesn\u0027t curl her hair any longer. Amasai, who used to be so obliging about beating rugs and carrying wood, grumbles if you suggest such a thing. Also his neckties are quite dingy--black and brown, where they used to be scarlet and purple. I\u0027ve determined never to marry. It\u0027s a deteriorating process, evidently. There isn\u0027t much of any farm news. The animals are all in the best of health. The pigs are unusually fat, the cows seem contented and the hens are laying well. Are you interested in poultry? If so, let me recommend that invaluable little work, 200 Eggs per Hen per Year. I am thinking of starting an incubator next spring and raising broilers. You see I\u0027m settled at Lock Willow permanently. I have decided to stay until I\u0027ve written 114 novels like Anthony Trollope\u0027s mother. Then I shall have completed my life work and can retire and travel. Mr. James McBride spent last Sunday with us. Fried chicken and ice-cream for dinner, both of which he appeared to appreciate. I was awfully glad to see him; he brought a momentary reminder that the world at large exists. Poor Jimmie is having a hard time peddling his bonds. The `Farmers\u0027 National\u0027 at the Corners wouldn\u0027t have anything to do with them in spite of the fact that they pay six per cent. interest and sometimes seven. I think he\u0027ll end up by going home to Worcester and taking a job in his father\u0027s factory. He\u0027s too open and confiding and kind-hearted ever to make a successful financier. But to be the manager of a flourishing overall factory is a very desirable position, don\u0027t you think? Just now he turns up his nose at overalls, but he\u0027ll come to them. I hope you appreciate the fact that this is a long letter from a person with writer\u0027s cramp. But I still love you, Daddy dear, and I\u0027m very happy. With beautiful scenery all about, and lots to eat and a comfortable four-post bed and a ream of blank paper and a pint of ink--what more does one want in the world? Yours as always, Judy PS. The postman arrives with some more news. We are to expect Master Jervie on Friday next to spend a week. That\u0027s a very pleasant prospect--only I am afraid my poor book will suffer. Master Jervie is very demanding.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59789.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
