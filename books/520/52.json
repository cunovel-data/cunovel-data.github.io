{"id":44718,"no":52,"title":"5th March","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n President Cuyler made a speech this evening about the modern \\n\\n generation being flippant and superficial. He says that we are \\n\\n losing the old ideals of earnest endeavour and true scholarship; \\n\\n and particularly is this falling-off noticeable in our disrespectful \\n\\n attitude towards organized authority. We no longer pay a seemly \\n\\n deference to our superiors. \\n\\n \\n\\n I came away from chapel very sober. \\n\\n \\n\\n Am I too familiar, Daddy? Ought I to treat you with more dignity \\n\\n and aloofness?--Yes, I\u0027m sure I ought. I\u0027ll begin again. \\n\\n \\n\\n My Dear Mr. Smith, \\n\\n \\n\\n You will be pleased to hear that I passed successfully my mid-year \\n\\n examinations, and am now commencing work in the new semester. I am \\n\\n leaving chemistry--having completed the course in qualitative analysis-- \\n\\n and am entering upon the study of biology. I approach this subject with \\n\\n some hesitation, as I understand that we dissect angleworms and frogs. \\n\\n \\n\\n An extremely interesting and valuable lecture was given in the \\n\\n chapel last week upon Roman Remains in Southern France. I have \\n\\n never listened to a more illuminating exposition of the subject. \\n\\n \\n\\n We are reading Wordsworth\u0027s Tintern Abbey in connection with our \\n\\n course in English Literature. What an exquisite work it is, \\n\\n and how adequately it embodies his conceptions of Pantheism! \\n\\n The Romantic movement of the early part of the last century, \\n\\n exemplified in the works of such poets as Shelley, Byron, Keats, \\n\\n and Wordsworth, appeals to me very much more than the Classical \\n\\n period that preceded it. Speaking of poetry, have you ever read \\n\\n that charming little thing of Tennyson\u0027s called Locksley Hall? \\n\\n \\n\\n I am attending gymnasium very regularly of late. A proctor \\n\\n system has been devised, and failure to comply with the rules \\n\\n causes a great deal of inconvenience. The gymnasium is equipped \\n\\n with a very beautiful swimming tank of cement and marble, the gift \\n\\n of a former graduate. My room-mate, Miss McBride, has given me \\n\\n her bathing-suit (it shrank so that she can no longer wear it) \\n\\n and I am about to begin swimming lessons. \\n\\n \\n\\n We had delicious pink ice-cream for dessert last night. \\n\\n Only vegetable dyes are used in colouring the food. The college \\n\\n is very much opposed, both from aesthetic and hygienic motives, \\n\\n to the use of aniline dyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n The weather of late has been ideal--bright sunshine and clouds \\n\\n interspersed with a few welcome snow-storms. I and my companions \\n\\n have enjoyed our walks to and from classes--particularly from. \\n\\n \\n\\n Trusting, my dear Mr. Smith, that this will find you in your usual \\n\\n good health, \\n\\n I remain, \\n\\n Most cordially yours, \\n\\n Jerusha Abbott \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59774.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
