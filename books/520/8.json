{"id":44674,"no":8,"title":"15th November","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Listen to what I\u0027ve learned to-day. \\n\\n \\n\\n The area of the convex surface of the frustum of a regular pyramid \\n\\n is half the product of the sum of the perimeters of its bases \\n\\n by the altitude of either of its trapezoids. \\n\\n \\n\\n It doesn\u0027t sound true, but it is--I can prove it! \\n\\n \\n\\n You\u0027ve never heard about my clothes, have you, Daddy? Six dresses, \\n\\n all new and beautiful and bought for me--not handed down from \\n\\n somebody bigger. Perhaps you don\u0027t realize what a climax that marks \\n\\n in the career of an orphan? You gave them to me, and I am very, very, \\n\\n VERY much obliged. It\u0027s a fine thing to be educated--but nothing \\n\\n compared to the dizzying experience of owning six new dresses. \\n\\n Miss Pritchard, who is on the visiting committee, picked them out-- \\n\\n not Mrs. Lippett, thank goodness. I have an evening dress, pink mull \\n\\n over silk (I\u0027m perfectly beautiful in that), and a blue church dress, \\n\\n and a dinner dress of red veiling with Oriental trimming (makes \\n\\n me look like a Gipsy), and another of rose-coloured challis, \\n\\n and a grey street suit, and an every-day dress for classes. \\n\\n That wouldn\u0027t be an awfully big wardrobe for Julia Rutledge Pendleton, \\n\\n perhaps, but for Jerusha Abbott--Oh, my! \\n\\n \\n\\n I suppose you\u0027re thinking now what a frivolous, shallow little \\n\\n beast she is, and what a waste of money to educate a girl? \\n\\n \\n\\n But, Daddy, if you\u0027d been dressed in checked ginghams all your life, \\n\\n you\u0027d appreciate how I feel. And when I started to the high school, \\n\\n I entered upon another period even worse than the checked ginghams. \\n\\n \\n\\n The poor box. \\n\\n \\n\\n You can\u0027t know how I dreaded appearing in school in those miserable \\n\\n poor-box dresses. I was perfectly sure to be put down in class \\n\\n next to the girl who first owned my dress, and she would whisper \\n\\n and giggle and point it out to the others. The bitterness \\n\\n of wearing your enemies\u0027 cast-off clothes eats into your soul. \\n\\n If I wore silk stockings for the rest of my life, I don\u0027t believe \\n\\n I could obliterate the scar. \\n\\n \\n\\n LATEST WAR BULLETIN! \\n\\n \\n\\n News from the Scene of Action. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n At the fourth watch on Thursday the 13th of November, Hannibal routed \\n\\n the advance guard of the Romans and led the Carthaginian forces \\n\\n over the mountains into the plains of Casilinum. A cohort of light \\n\\n armed Numidians engaged the infantry of Quintus Fabius Maximus. \\n\\n Two battles and light skirmishing. Romans repulsed with heavy losses. \\n\\n I have the honour of being, \\n\\n Your special correspondent from the front, \\n\\n J. Abbott \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. I know I\u0027m not to expect any letters in return, and I\u0027ve \\n\\n been warned not to bother you with questions, but tell me, Daddy, \\n\\n just this once--are you awfully old or just a little old? And are \\n\\n you perfectly bald or just a little bald? It is very difficult \\n\\n thinking about you in the abstract like a theorem in geometry. \\n\\n \\n\\n Given a tall rich man who hates girls, but is very generous to one \\n\\n quite impertinent girl, what does he look like? \\n\\n \\n\\n R.S.V.P. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59730.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
