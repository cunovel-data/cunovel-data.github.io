{"id":44714,"no":48,"title":"9th November","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \n \n I started down town today to buy a bottle of shoe blacking and some \n collars and the material for a new blouse and a jar of violet cream \n and a cake of Castile soap--all very necessary; I couldn\u0027t be happy \n another day without them--and when I tried to pay the car fare, \n I found that I had left my purse in the pocket of my other coat. \n So I had to get out and take the next car, and was late for gymnasium. \n \n It\u0027s a dreadful thing to have no memory and two coats! \n \n Julia Pendleton has invited me to visit her for the Christmas holidays. \n How does that strike you, Mr. Smith? Fancy Jerusha Abbott, \n of the John Grier Home, sitting at the tables of the rich. \n I don\u0027t know why Julia wants me--she seems to be getting quite \n attached to me of late. I should, to tell the truth, very much \n prefer going to Sallie\u0027s, but Julia asked me first, so if I \n go anywhere it must be to New York instead of to Worcester. \n I\u0027m rather awed at the prospect of meeting Pendletons EN MASSE, \n and also I\u0027d have to get a lot of new clothes--so, Daddy dear, \n if you write that you would prefer having me remain quietly at college, \n I will bow to your wishes with my usual sweet docility. \n \n I\u0027m engaged at odd moments with the Life and Letters of Thomas Huxley-- \n it makes nice, light reading to pick up between times. Do you know \n what an archaeopteryx is? It\u0027s a bird. And a stereognathus? \n I\u0027m not sure myself, but I think it\u0027s a missing link, like a bird \n with teeth or a lizard with wings. No, it isn\u0027t either; I\u0027ve just \n looked in the book. It\u0027s a mesozoic mammal. \n \n I\u0027ve elected economics this year--very illuminating subject. \n When I finish that I\u0027m going to take Charity and Reform; then, \n Mr. Trustee, I\u0027ll know just how an orphan asylum ought to be run. \n Don\u0027t you think I\u0027d make an admirable voter if I had my rights? \n I was twenty-one last week. This is an awfully wasteful country to \n throw away such an honest, educated, conscientious, intelligent citizen \n as I would be. \n Yours always, \n Judy \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59770.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
