{"id":44686,"no":20,"title":"30th May","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs, \\n\\n \\n\\n Did you ever see this campus? (That is merely a rhetorical question. \\n\\n Don\u0027t let it annoy you.) It is a heavenly spot in May. All the \\n\\n shrubs are in blossom and the trees are the loveliest young green-- \\n\\n even the old pines look fresh and new. The grass is dotted with yellow \\n\\n dandelions and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses. \\n\\n Everybody is joyous and carefree, for vacation\u0027s coming, and with \\n\\n that to look forward to, examinations don\u0027t count. \\n\\n \\n\\n Isn\u0027t that a happy frame of mind to be in? And oh, Daddy! \\n\\n I\u0027m the happiest of all! Because I\u0027m not in the asylum any more; \\n\\n and I\u0027m not anybody\u0027s nursemaid or typewriter or bookkeeper (I \\n\\n should have been, you know, except for you). \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m sorry now for all my past badnesses. \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m sorry I was ever impertinent to Mrs. Lippett. \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m sorry I ever slapped Freddie Perkins. \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m sorry I ever filled the sugar bowl with salt. \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m sorry I ever made faces behind the Trustees\u0027 backs. \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m going to be good and sweet and kind to everybody because I\u0027m \\n\\n so happy. And this summer I\u0027m going to write and write and write \\n\\n and begin to be a great author. Isn\u0027t that an exalted stand \\n\\n to take? Oh, I\u0027m developing a beautiful character! It droops \\n\\n a bit under cold and frost, but it does grow fast when the sun shines. \\n\\n \\n\\n That\u0027s the way with everybody. I don\u0027t agree with the theory that \\n\\n adversity and sorrow and disappointment develop moral strength. \\n\\n The happy people are the ones who are bubbling over with kindliness. \\n\\n I have no faith in misanthropes. (Fine word! Just learned it.) \\n\\n You are not a misanthrope are you, Daddy? \\n\\n \\n\\n I started to tell you about the campus. I wish you\u0027d come \\n\\n for a little visit and let me walk you about and say: \\n\\n \\n\\n `That is the library. This is the gas plant, Daddy dear. \\n\\n The Gothic building on your left is the gymnasium, and the Tudor \\n\\n Romanesque beside it is the new infirmary.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Oh, I\u0027m fine at showing people about. I\u0027ve done it all my life at \\n\\n the asylum, and I\u0027ve been doing it all day here. I have honestly. \\n\\n \\n\\n And a Man, too! \\n\\n \\n\\n That\u0027s a great experience. I never talked to a man before (except \\n\\n occasional Trustees, and they don\u0027t count). Pardon, Daddy, I don\u0027t \\n\\n mean to hurt your feelings when I abuse Trustees. I don\u0027t consider \\n\\n that you really belong among them. You just tumbled on to the Board \\n\\n by chance. The Trustee, as such, is fat and pompous and benevolent. \\n\\n He pats one on the head and wears a gold watch chain. \\n\\n \\n\\n That looks like a June bug, but is meant to be a portrait of any \\n\\n Trustee except you. \\n\\n \\n\\n However--to resume: \\n\\n \\n\\n I have been walking and talking and having tea with a man. \\n\\n And with a very superior man--with Mr. Jervis Pendleton of the House \\n\\n of Julia; her uncle, in short (in long, perhaps I ought to say; \\n\\n he\u0027s as tall as you.) Being in town on business, he decided to run \\n\\n out to the college and call on his niece. He\u0027s her father\u0027s \\n\\n youngest brother, but she doesn\u0027t know him very intimately. It seems \\n\\n he glanced at her when she was a baby, decided he didn\u0027t like her, \\n\\n and has never noticed her since. \\n\\n \\n\\n Anyway, there he was, sitting in the reception room very proper \\n\\n with his hat and stick and gloves beside him; and Julia and Sallie \\n\\n with seventh-hour recitations that they couldn\u0027t cut. So Julia \\n\\n dashed into my room and begged me to walk him about the campus \\n\\n and then deliver him to her when the seventh hour was over. \\n\\n I said I would, obligingly but unenthusiastically, because I don\u0027t \\n\\n care much for Pendletons. \\n\\n \\n\\n But he turned out to be a sweet lamb. He\u0027s a real human being-- \\n\\n not a Pendleton at all. We had a beautiful time; I\u0027ve longed \\n\\n for an uncle ever since. Do you mind pretending you\u0027re my uncle? \\n\\n I believe they\u0027re superior to grandmothers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Pendleton reminded me a little of you, Daddy, as you were twenty \\n\\n years ago. You see I know you intimately, even if we haven\u0027t \\n\\n ever met! \\n\\n \\n\\n He\u0027s tall and thinnish with a dark face all over lines, and the \\n\\n funniest underneath smile that never quite comes through but just \\n\\n wrinkles up the corners of his mouth. And he has a way of making \\n\\n you feel right off as though you\u0027d known him a long time. \\n\\n He\u0027s very companionable. \\n\\n \\n\\n We walked all over the campus from the quadrangle to the athletic grounds; \\n\\n then he said he felt weak and must have some tea. He proposed that \\n\\n we go to College Inn--it\u0027s just off the campus by the pine walk. \\n\\n I said we ought to go back for Julia and Sallie, but he said he didn\u0027t \\n\\n like to have his nieces drink too much tea; it made them nervous. \\n\\n So we just ran away and had tea and muffins and marmalade and \\n\\n ice-cream and cake at a nice little table out on the balcony. \\n\\n The inn was quite conveniently empty, this being the end of the month \\n\\n and allowances low. \\n\\n \\n\\n We had the jolliest time! But he had to run for his train \\n\\n the minute he got back and he barely saw Julia at all. She was \\n\\n furious with me for taking him off; it seems he\u0027s an unusually rich \\n\\n and desirable uncle. It relieved my mind to find he was rich, \\n\\n for the tea and things cost sixty cents apiece. \\n\\n \\n\\n This morning (it\u0027s Monday now) three boxes of chocolates came by \\n\\n express for Julia and Sallie and me. What do you think of that? \\n\\n To be getting candy from a man! \\n\\n \\n\\n I begin to feel like a girl instead of a foundling. \\n\\n \\n\\n I wish you\u0027d come and have tea some day and let me see if I like you. \\n\\n But wouldn\u0027t it be dreadful if I didn\u0027t? However, I know I should. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bien! I make you my compliments. \\n\\n `Jamais je ne t\u0027oublierai.\u0027 \\n\\n Judy \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n PS. I looked in the glass this morning and found a perfectly \\n\\n new dimple that I\u0027d never seen before. It\u0027s very curious. \\n\\n Where do you suppose it came from? \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59742.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
