{"id":44671,"no":5,"title":"Friday","content":"What do you think, Daddy? The English instructor said that my last \\n\\n paper shows an unusual amount of originality. She did, truly. \\n\\n Those were her words. It doesn\u0027t seem possible, does it, \\n\\n considering the eighteen years of training that I\u0027ve had? The aim \\n\\n of the John Grier Home (as you doubtless know and heartily approve of) \\n\\n is to turn the ninety-seven orphans into ninety-seven twins. \\n\\n \\n\\n The unusual artistic ability which I exhibit was developed at an early \\n\\n age through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs. Lippett on the woodshed door. \\n\\n \\n\\n I hope that I don\u0027t hurt your feelings when I criticize the home \\n\\n of my youth? But you have the upper hand, you know, for if I become \\n\\n too impertinent, you can always stop payment of your cheques. \\n\\n That isn\u0027t a very polite thing to say--but you can\u0027t expect me \\n\\n to have any manners; a foundling asylum isn\u0027t a young ladies\u0027 \\n\\n finishing school. \\n\\n \\n\\n You know, Daddy, it isn\u0027t the work that is going to be hard in college. \\n\\n It\u0027s the play. Half the time I don\u0027t know what the girls are \\n\\n talking about; their jokes seem to relate to a past that every one \\n\\n but me has shared. I\u0027m a foreigner in the world and I don\u0027t understand \\n\\n the language. It\u0027s a miserable feeling. I\u0027ve had it all my life. \\n\\n At the high school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me. \\n\\n I was queer and different and everybody knew it. I could FEEL \\n\\n `John Grier Home\u0027 written on my face. And then a few charitable \\n\\n ones would make a point of coming up and saying something polite. \\n\\n I HATED EVERY ONE OF THEM--the charitable ones most of all. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nobody here knows that I was brought up in an asylum. I told \\n\\n Sallie McBride that my mother and father were dead, and that a kind \\n\\n old gentleman was sending me to college which is entirely true \\n\\n so far as it goes. I don\u0027t want you to think I am a coward, \\n\\n but I do want to be like the other girls, and that Dreadful Home \\n\\n looming over my childhood is the one great big difference. \\n\\n If I can turn my back on that and shut out the remembrance, I think, \\n\\n I might be just as desirable as any other girl. I don\u0027t believe \\n\\n there\u0027s any real, underneath difference, do you? \\n\\n \\n\\n Anyway, Sallie McBride likes me! \\n\\n Yours ever, \\n\\n Judy Abbott \\n\\n (Nee Jerusha.) \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59727.html","bookId":520,"book":{"id":520,"title":"DADDY-LONG-LEGS 长腿叔叔","description":"简介： 主要讲述了 茱迪从小在孤儿院里长大，年轻的她不得不负担起众多沉重的工作，而不能享受普通女孩子拥有的家庭乐趣。有一天，她的命运被传奇般地改变了，一位自称约翰-史密斯的理事因为她出色的作文而将她送进了大学，她开始了完全不同的生活，她亲昵地叫这位理事长腿叔叔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:53 AM"}}
