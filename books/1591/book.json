On the run for a murder he didn’t commit, he tries to hide out by selling himself at an auction for love slaves.

When Ryan gets off the transport bringing him to Blayde, however, he’s startled at Blayde’s violent reaction once he touches him. Dominant Blayde has recognized Ryan as his mate, and now Blayde has to figure out not only how he can possibly convince the young man to stay with him, and allow him to teach him proper behavior, but also how he’ll manage to keep Ryan alive long enough to save him from his powerful enemies.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/most-wanted-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-1.jpg","author":"Shannon West","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":24,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
