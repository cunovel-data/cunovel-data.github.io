{"id":84785,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Mila I love the night. I love everything about it. I love how the blackness hides things that I might not want to see, yet at the same time exposes things that I wouldn\u0027t see in the light of day. I love the stars and the moon and the velvety wetness against my skin. I love how Lake Michigan turns black in the dark and shimmers like shattered onyx glass in the moonlight. It always feels a little bit dangerous. Maybe that\u0027s why I like it, too. I grip my camera as I step over the soft, damp sand of the beach. The breeze is always cool here, but it\u0027s just because the air is cold as it blows in from the lake. The water is always frigid, summer or winter, like God dumped a big glass of ice water into it. I wrap my sweater more tightly around me before I look through the lens again. The moon is full tonight and it hangs just at the edge of the horizon, right where the water meets the sky. It\u0027s got a reddish tint to it, something that we don\u0027t get to see very often. The sailors call it a Blood Moon and I can see why. It\u0027s ethereal and beautiful; haunting, actually. It\u0027s why I\u0027m here tonight. I start snapping pictures; kneeling, standing, then kneeling again. When a large wisp of fog floats partially in front of the moon, I gasp. I\u0027ve never seen a more perfect picture. It will make an amazing painting. And the framed print will look good, too. Either way works for me since I\u0027ve got customers for both. I take at least a hundred pictures before I\u0027m finally satisfied with the light, the luminosity and the angle. As I tuck my camera into its bag, I take a huge breath of the fresh, crisp lake air and enjoy my walk back along the beach. I love the way my bare feet sink into the thick silvery sand and I take care not to trip over random pieces of jagged driftwood. It\u0027s a good night to let my thoughts drift. The air is so still and the silence is enormous. Even the seagulls have gone to sleep, so there is no one here to bother me. Complete and perfect solitude. As the breeze blows my hair away from my face, I absently think of my to-do list in my studio and what I need to order tomorrow when I re-stock my supplies. I also wonder if I remembered to lock my house, although it won\u0027t be a huge issue if I didn\u0027t. In a larger city, I\u0027d have to be more careful about that, and definitely more careful about walking alone at night. But here in Angel Bay, I\u0027m as safe as I\u0027m going to get. We have a crime rate here that belongs in a 1950\u0027s Mayberry kind of town. The most crime we see is jaywalking during peak tourist season. As I climb over a dune and into the parking lot where I left my car, I\u0027m surprised to find a black, glistening muscle car facing the lake. It hadn\u0027t been here when I arrived earlier. I sigh. My solitude has been interrupted. But honestly, it doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m leaving anyway. Slipping my shoes back on, I pad across the pavement toward my car, but as I do, I notice that the other car\u0027s door is standing wide open. I can hear the dinging sound from here. Apparently, the keys are still in the ignition. That\u0027s strange and I pause, staring at the lonely car. I\u0027m uncertain, because it\u0027s dark and I\u0027m alone. But the insistent buzzing ding of the open car door pulls me to it. I can only hope that the owner isn\u0027t a mass murderer. I curl my fingers around the cell phone in my pocket, as if it could actually shield me from danger. Regardless of the ridiculousness of that thought, I keep the phone planted firmly in my palm. As I draw closer, I see a black battered boot dangling through the doorsill of the car. It isn\u0027t moving. Normally, I wouldn\u0027t think anything of it. I\u0027d think that the person attached to the black boot was just asleep. But something seems wrong here. Something tangibly ominous seems to hang about like a cloud. Not many people could sleep with that annoying buzz coming from the open door. I creep up on the car and gaze inside, covering my mouth with my hand as I do. There is an overpowering stench of vomit and I immediately see the reason. The guy in the driver\u0027s seat has passed out in a large pool of orangey-red puke. His mouth is slack, hanging open, and sticky tendrils of vomit stretch from his chin to his chest. I shudder. It\u0027s definitely not this guy\u0027s finest hour. He\u0027s very, very still, but I know he\u0027s breathing because he\u0027s making strange gurgling noises. The tiny snorts vibrate through the cartilage of his nose, muffled by the vomit bubbling around his mouth. That can\u0027t be good. I gag from the smell and shake his shoulder. His head lolls loosely around and hangs to his chest. I shake him again, but he doesn\u0027t come to, his head just jerks limply from side to side, like a doll with a broken neck. Holy crap. I feel more panicky by the minute, my heart thrumming like a hummingbird trapped inside my ribcage. I\u0027m not sure what to do. He could\u0027ve just passed out from drinking too much. In fact, I see a bottle of whiskey on the floorboard that could attest to that. But there\u0027s something wrong. Something that I can\u0027t put my finger on, but my gut is screaming at me now. So I do the first thing that I think of. I pull out my phone and call 9-1-1. They answer on the second ring and ask what my emergency is. I stare at the young guy. \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I say uncertainly. \"But my name is Mila Hill and I\u0027m down on Goose Beach in the parking lot. There\u0027s a guy here, passed out in his car. I can\u0027t wake him up. I think something\u0027s wrong with him.\" \"Is he breathing?\" the woman on the phone asks calmly. I check again, then tell her yes. \"That\u0027s good,\" she tells me. \"Do you feel comfortable waiting there until help arrives?\" \"Yes,\" I tell her. \"I\u0027ll wait with him.\" Knowing that help is on the way calms me down. I move a couple steps away and watch the unconscious man. He still isn\u0027t moving, except for the slow, ragged rise and fall of his chest. I swallow hard as I glance over the rest of him. He\u0027s got tattoos on his toned bicep and a jagged scar in the shape of an X at the base of his thumb. I know this, because his arm is now dangling outside of the car. Vomit runs down his forearm and drips onto the pavement. I cringe and move back to him, lifting his hand and placing it on his stomach. His stomach is hard and flat. And covered in vomit. If he weren\u0027t lying in that vomit, he\u0027d be handsome. That much is certain, even in the dark. He looks to be in his mid to late twenties. He\u0027s wearing black jeans, a black t-shirt and has brownish-blonde hair. He\u0027s got day old stubble and I find myself really wishing that he\u0027d open his eyes. \"Wake up,\" I tell him. I don\u0027t know him, but I definitely want him to be okay. I\u0027ve seen friends pass out from drinking before. This isn\u0027t that. This is far worse. The strange gurgling coming from his nose is proof of that. I glance at his car again. I\u0027ve seen it around town, but I don\u0027t know him. I\u0027ve never bumped into him before...until now. And this isn\u0027t a great first impression. I am trying to wake him again when I hear a woman\u0027s angry voice. \"Pax, you fucking asshole. I\u0027m not walking into town, so you\u0027re going to take me. I fucking mean it.\" I startle, then straighten up to come face-to-face with the owner of the less-than-pleasant words. She\u0027s as startled as I am. I\u0027ve seen her before. She\u0027s a rough-around-the-edges woman who hangs out all day in a bar on Main Street. Since my shop is only a few blocks away, I\u0027ve seen her walking around. Right now, she\u0027s wearing a tight-tight mini skirt and a shirt that is so low cut, I can practically see her navel. She\u0027s covered in old, faded tattoos and her make-up is smeared. Classy. \"Who the fuck are you?\" she demands as she stomps up to the car. Her brown hair is tousled and tangled. She looks harsh. And then she starts screaming when she sees the guy in the car. \"Pax!\" she screams, as she rushes to him. \"Oh my god. Wake up. Wake up! I shouldn\u0027t have left you. Holy fuck, holy fuck.\" \"What\u0027s wrong with him?\" I ask her quickly. \"I called 9-1-1 because I couldn\u0027t wake him.\" She yanks her face away from his. \"You called the police?\" she snaps. \"Why would you do that?\" I\u0027m incredulous. Clearly, her way of thinking is much different than my own. Her priorities are definitely in a different place. \"Because he needs help,\" I tell her. \"Obviously. An ambulance is on the way.\" She starts to glare at me again, but the guy in the car, Pax, starts gurgling again. And then he abruptly stops. He is still, his chin buried in his chest which is no longer moving. The woman and I look at each other. \"He\u0027s not breathing!\" she cries as she grabs him. \"Pax! Wake up!!\" She\u0027s shaking him so hard now that his teeth are rattling. I grab her arm. \"That\u0027s not going to help,\" I tell her urgently. Holy crap. She\u0027s right though, he\u0027s not breathing. My mind is buzzing as I try to figure out what to do and before I can decide on a plan of action, my body is moving with a mind of its own. I shove the woman out of the way and pull on Pax\u0027s arm with all of my might. He only comes partway out of the car, dangling half in, half out. He slumps over, his head almost grazing the concrete. His legs are firmly tangled beneath the steering wheel and we are now both covered in his smelly vomit. \"Help me,\" I bark at the motionless woman. She snaps out of her hysteria and between the two of us, we drag the man out of the car and onto the sandy pavement. I kneel beside him and feel for a heartbeat. He\u0027s got one, but it\u0027s faint and thready. And since he\u0027s not breathing, I know it won\u0027t last long. Shit. I try to remember the details of CPR, fail and then just do the best I can. I pinch his nose closed, tilt his head back and breathe into his mouth. He tastes like ashes, Jack Daniels and vomit. I fight the urge to gag, fail, and dry heave to the side. Then I square my shoulders and give him a couple more breaths. I gag again as I pause and listen at his chest. Nothing. He\u0027s still not breathing. \"Do something,\" the woman hisses. I tune her out and breathe into Pax\u0027s mouth again. And again. And again. Nothing. What the hell do I do now? I am past being repulsed at the taste in his mouth. I\u0027m only focused on trying to keep his lungs filled with oxygen, trying to make him take his own breaths. But it\u0027s not working. He\u0027s not breathing. I am frantic and on the verge of hysteria myself, when I give him two last futile breaths. And then I have to lunge out of the way as he chokes, then coughs, then vomits in a geyser-like fountain of orange puke. I quickly shove him onto his side so he doesn\u0027t choke on it. By this point, he and I are both completely covered in his vomit. It isn\u0027t pleasant, but at least he\u0027s breathing now. It\u0027s ragged and slow, but he\u0027s breathing. His eyes are still closed, but I can see them moving now, rapidly, behind his eyelids. And then he starts convulsing. Oh my God. I don\u0027t know what to do. \"What do we do?\" I cry out to the girl behind me. I don\u0027t even look at her, I am just focused on the orange foam coming from this guy\u0027s mouth. It billows out and upward, soaking into his nostrils and smearing everywhere as he flails. Bits of it fly off of him in orange flecks and land on my sweater. I grab his arm and hold it down. He\u0027s strong, even in this state and it takes all of my weight to keep him immobile. I practically lie across his chest, his arm folded beneath me. After a moment, his convulsions stop and he\u0027s limp. But he\u0027s still breathing. I can hear the rattle of his chest. It seems like every breath he takes is an effort. I am on the verge of crying, simply from not knowing what to do, when I see red and blue lights flashing against his car. I exhale a breath of relief. Help has arrived. Thank God. \"Run over and bring them here,\" I tell the girl. I turn, only to find her gone. What the hell? I peer into the darkness and see her running away, up and over the nearest sand dune. Apparently, she doesn\u0027t want to be here when the authorities arrive. Interesting. It takes the paramedics only a minute or so to leap from their ambulance and begin administering help to the prone man in front of me. I\u0027m not sure what to do, so I shrink back to the periphery and limply wait. I watch as they shove a breathing tube down his throat. And then I watch as they do chest compressions, which can only mean one thing. His heart stopped. At that realization, mine feels like it stops as well. I don\u0027t know why. I don\u0027t even know him. But being thrown into this intense situation makes me feel connected to him. It\u0027s a stupid notion, but I can\u0027t help feeling it. Even though the only thing I really know about him is his name. Pax. I can hear the sickening sound of his bones cracking and bending while the paramedics thrust hard against his chest, trying to force his heart into beating again. It makes me cringe and I look away, trying to tune it out. It\u0027s at this moment, while my eyes are squeezed shut, that a police officer approaches me and asks me some questions. Do I know him? What was I doing here? How did I find him? Was he alone? DoyouknowhowlonghewashereDoyouknowwhathetookDoyouknowhowmuchhedrank? The cop\u0027s monotone runs together and I answer as best as I can. By the time he is done, the EMTs are loading Pax into the ambulance. They run to the front and jump in, their tires squealing as they lurch from the parking lot and onto the road leading to town. Their siren and lights are on. That\u0027s got to be a good thing. That means he is still alive. Right? I\u0027m frozen in place and shaky as I stare at the car, as I watch the policeman search through it. He puts some items into plastic baggies and shakes his head. \"I don\u0027t know why I bother. His dad will get him off, just like he did last time.\" The cop is muttering and I\u0027m not sure if he\u0027s talking to me or to himself. So I ask. He smiles grimly. \"Either of us, I guess. The situation is just frustrating. Here\u0027s a kid who could have the world on a string, but he seems to be dead set on fucking himself up. Pardon my language, miss. But he needs to land himself in jail or rehab, in order to straighten himself out. But he comes from money and his father is some big shot attorney in Chicago, so he always gets a pass. One of these times, though, someone\u0027s gonna take him away in a body bag. He\u0027s just lucky that you found him in time tonight or today would have been the day.\" Lucky. I picture the orange foam that erupted from his mouth as Pax had convulsed on the rough pavement in front of me and I\u0027m not so sure that I\u0027d use that word. Whatever he is, lucky doesn\u0027t seem to be it. I\u0027m shaken now as I head to my car and drop onto the seat. I am covered in vomit and my mouth tastes like an ashtray from the seediest bar in the world. I grab a bottle of water and gulp at it, swishing it around inside my mouth and then spitting it out on the ground. What the hell just happened? I had come here to get some shots of the beautiful, tranquil full moon and had ended up saving someone\u0027s life. Unless he dies. And in that case, then I guess I ended up doing nothing at all...except acquiring a horrible taste of someone else\u0027s vomit in my mouth and seeing images that I am sure will haunt my dreams for some time to come. I take another shaky drink of water and turn the key in my ignition. I hope he doesn\u0027t die. I really do.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-2.html","bookId":2758,"book":{"id":2758,"title":"If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1)","description":"Storyline: If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1) 24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole.
