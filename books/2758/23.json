What he does know is that he and his dad are left alone and with more issues than they can count. \n As Pax grew up, he tried to be the kid his father always wanted; the perfect golden boy, but it didn’t work. His dad couldn’t overcome his grief long enough to notice and Pax couldn’t keep up the impossible perfect façade. \n So he slipped far, far from it. \n Now, he uses drugs and women to cope with the ugliness, the black void that he doesn’t want to deal with. If he pretends that the emptiness isn’t there, then it isn’t, right? \n Wrong. \n And it’s never more apparent than when he meets Mila. \n Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart. He doesn’t know how to not hurt her, but he quickly realizes that he’s got to figure it out because he needs her to breathe. \n When memories of his mother’s death resurface from where he’s repressed them for so long, Mila is there to catch him when the guilt starts making sense. Mila is the one…the one who can save him from his broken troubled heart; from his issues, from the emptiness. \n But only if he can stop being an asshole long enough to allow it. \n He knows that. And he’s working on it. \n But is that enough to make her stay?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1.jpg","author":"Courtney Cole","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:27 PM"}}
