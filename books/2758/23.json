If I can\u0027t feel, then nothing hurts. So I keep it that way. If I wake, I drink myself back to sleep with a Xanax chaser. It isn\u0027t long before I\u0027m in the black again, drifting pointlessly along, sleeping without nightmares. Only blackness. I sigh. This is where I belong, where the dark is timeless. Painless. The light is painful. The light is where I see her face and know how I failed her. I\u0027ll stay far away from the light. Forever. It isn\u0027t worth it. I start to close my eyes but realize that they are already closed, so I smile. This is where I belong.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-23.html","bookId":2758,"book":{"id":2758,"title":"If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1)","description":"Storyline: If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1) 24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole. Seriously. He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. But he’s got his reasons. His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why. What he does know is that he and his dad are left alone and with more issues than they can count. As Pax grew up, he tried to be the kid his father always wanted; the perfect golden boy, but it didn’t work. His dad couldn’t overcome his grief long enough to notice and Pax couldn’t keep up the impossible perfect façade. So he slipped far, far from it. Now, he uses drugs and women to cope with the ugliness, the black void that he doesn’t want to deal with. If he pretends that the emptiness isn’t there, then it isn’t, right? Wrong. And it’s never more apparent than when he meets Mila. Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart. He doesn’t know how to not hurt her, but he quickly realizes that he’s got to figure it out because he needs her to breathe. When memories of his mother’s death resurface from where he’s repressed them for so long, Mila is there to catch him when the guilt starts making sense. Mila is the one…the one who can save him from his broken troubled heart; from his issues, from the emptiness. But only if he can stop being an asshole long enough to allow it. He knows that. And he’s working on it. But is that enough to make her stay?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1.jpg","author":"Courtney Cole","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:27 PM"}}
