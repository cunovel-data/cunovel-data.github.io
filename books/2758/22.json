All I know is that I can\u0027t turn the emotions off and I can\u0027t un-see the memories that are in my head now.\n My father tries to call, but I don\u0027t speak with him. Mila answers and turns to me but I look away. I don\u0027t want to hear from him. Fuck him.\n Dr. Tyler tries to call. But I won\u0027t speak with him, either. Mila asks, then she turns away, speaking softly to the doctor. But I don\u0027t give a fuck about that, either. They can say what they want.\n And Mila.\n Fuck.\n My stomach clenches at the thought of Mila. I\u0027m causing her pain, too. Because I can\u0027t be the person she needs me to be right now. I can\u0027t drive back to the doctor\u0027s and sit with her while we discuss my feelings. Instead, I\u0027m an asshole. Because that\u0027s who I am. That\u0027s what I do best. There for a while, I tried to pretend that I wasn\u0027t, but my true colors are showing now.\n I\u0027m a fucking dick.\n Nothing I\u0027ve done so far, though, has caused her to leave. I don\u0027t want to talk, I pace instead of sleep, I drink too fucking much and I even angry-fucked her. She didn\u0027t leave. She just looked at me, so understanding and soft, and said she wanted to help me however she could.\n What the fuck?\n My stomach clenches. As angry as I am at life, I don\u0027t want to hurt her.\n I turn to her now, to where she is curled up on the couch reading.\n \"Mila, you really should leave,\" I tell her abruptly. \"I\u0027m not fit company. I think it would be best if you went back to your place while I work through this.\"\n She looks at me, wounded. And my gut clenches again. I know I have to do this. I\u0027m only going to hurt her in the long run anyway. I might as well do it in one fell swoop. A clean break. She starts to protest, but I interrupt.\n \"It\u0027s fine to leave me. I\u0027m through the worst of it. You have a life to get back to, a job. Your sister needs you. Please. I need time alone. You can call me tonight.\"\n She looks uncertain and my heart twinges.\n Fuck, how I hate this.\n But this is what I deserve. I don\u0027t deserve someone like her.\n She stands up, reaching up to touch my face. I close my eyes for just a minute, but then steel my resolve and open them again.\n I stare down at her and remove her hand. That hurts her, I can see it.\n It\u0027s for the best.\n She finally nods.\n \"Okay. If that\u0027s what you need,\" she says uncertainly. \"But call me if you need anything. And I\u0027ll come back tonight after I close my shop and check in with my sister.\"\n I nod. I walk away before I stop her from leaving.\n I hear her car pulling out of the drive and I throw my glass of water at the wall. It shatters and I replace it with a bottle of Jack.\n This is what I deserve.\n My chest feels like it is crushing me and I fight to swallow. There is just so much to deal with. I don\u0027t know where to start. So fuck it.\n I grab the bottle of Xanax from the counter and head to the couch with my whiskey. I drop into a heap and pop the top off the pill bottle, taking several and washing them down with the Jack.\n I drink the rest of the bottle.\n I close my eyes and for once, there is nothing there but blackness. I breathe a sigh of relief and I finally sleep.\n When I wake, it is morning.\n I know that because morning sunlight pours through the windows.\n I wince and sit up, rubbing my temples.\n I slept through the night. With no nightmares, no thoughts of my mother. I smile, my lips stretching tightly. Suddenly, it\u0027s clear. I can\u0027t handle the issues on my own. I need my old friend, Jack. And my new friend, Xanax.\n X marks the spot.\n I pick up my phone and glance at it. Three missed calls, three voicemails and twelve texts, all from Mila.\n Are you alright?\n Pax, answer your phone.\n Please answer your phone.\n I\u0027m worried about you, Pax. This isn\u0027t fair. Answer your phone.\n They pretty much all say the same thing. I punch in one answer.\n Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m fine.\n After I get a fresh bottle of whiskey from the kitchen, I pop more pills in my mouth, three of them. Then I add two more.\n It isn\u0027t long before the blackness comes back. I welcome it with open arms. I sing to it, I croon to it. I cradle it in my arms. I do whatever the fuck I want to do to it because it\u0027s blackness, the darkest of nights, and it doesn\u0027t care. If I am alone in the dark, nothing matters. I can\u0027t hurt anyone but myself and I fucking deserve it.\n I close my eyes and let the darkness cradle me. It can fuck me for all I care.\n Mila\n I can\u0027t think straight. I accidentally didn\u0027t charge a customer at the store. So after that, I gave up and turned my sign to Closed.\n I sit by the window of my store, staring out at the happy people walking down the sidewalk. They don\u0027t know how good they have it. Their lives are so easy.\n I try to text Pax again, but like the four days prior, there isn\u0027t any answer. I\u0027ve driven out there, pounded on the door, called him, even cussed into his voicemail.\n No answer.\n Only once. Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m fine.\n He\u0027s not fine. And no one seems to care but me.\n I\u0027ve thought about calling the police to have them check on him, but I doubt they would. He\u0027s not doing anything illegal, so what can they do? It\u0027s not illegal to drink yourself into a stupor. And the only thing he has in the house, to my knowledge, is the prescription Xanax. I once again wonder at the wisdom of prescribing that to Pax.\n When I had asked Dr. Tyler about it, he explained that he had prescribed it because Pax isn\u0027t an addict.\n \"He\u0027s not addicted to any substance,\" the doctor had said. \"He simply hasn\u0027t formed proper coping mechanisms for stress. If he feels like he can\u0027t cope, I\u0027d rather him take a Xanax during the short term while we\u0027re working on these issues rather than seek out illegal drugs. Plus, you\u0027ll be there with him. Everything will be fine, Mila.\"\n But I\u0027m not there anymore. And things aren\u0027t fine.\n I see an image of Jill\u0027s open, dead eyes and shudder.\n That could have been Pax. And I\u0027m terrified that if someone doesn\u0027t do something, that will be Pax.\n With shaking fingers, I pick up the phone and do the only thing I can think of to do.\n I call his father. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-22.html","bookId":2758,"book":{"id":2758,"title":"If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1)","description":"Storyline: \n If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1) \n 24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole. \n Seriously. \n He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. \n But he’s got his reasons. \n His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why. What he does know is that he and his dad are left alone and with more issues than they can count. \n As Pax grew up, he tried to be the kid his father always wanted; the perfect golden boy, but it didn’t work. His dad couldn’t overcome his grief long enough to notice and Pax couldn’t keep up the impossible perfect façade. \n So he slipped far, far from it. \n Now, he uses drugs and women to cope with the ugliness, the black void that he doesn’t want to deal with. If he pretends that the emptiness isn’t there, then it isn’t, right? \n Wrong. \n And it’s never more apparent than when he meets Mila. \n Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart. He doesn’t know how to not hurt her, but he quickly realizes that he’s got to figure it out because he needs her to breathe. \n When memories of his mother’s death resurface from where he’s repressed them for so long, Mila is there to catch him when the guilt starts making sense. Mila is the one…the one who can save him from his broken troubled heart; from his issues, from the emptiness. \n But only if he can stop being an asshole long enough to allow it. \n He knows that. And he’s working on it. \n But is that enough to make her stay?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1.jpg","author":"Courtney Cole","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:27 PM"}}
