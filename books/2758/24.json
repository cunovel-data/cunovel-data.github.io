{"id":84807,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"I open my eyes blearily, trying to focus. I look around at the room. I\u0027m in the living room and I seem to be wearing the same clothes that I\u0027ve been wearing for a while. What woke me? It\u0027s dark outside, so it wasn\u0027t the sun.\n I reach for my whiskey, but find that the bottle is empty.\n Fuck.\n That means I\u0027m out. I\u0027ll have to make a trip to town.\n And then I hear what woke me. Pounding on the door.\n My heart twinges. I know it\u0027s probably Mila. She\u0027s been here a hundred times this week, trying to get me to open the door, but I never get off the couch to do it. She doesn\u0027t need to see me this way. She doesn\u0027t deserve to be here like this.\n The pounding gets louder, very loud.\n Fuck. She\u0027s pissed now. I\u0027m impressed with the strength she\u0027s using on that door.\n And then, there\u0027s a loud crack and something breaks.\n What the fuck?\n I stand up and the room spins. I haven\u0027t been on my feet in a couple of days. I steady myself and re-open my eyes. When I do, I find my father standing in front of me. He is clean and shaven and dressed in jeans.\n \"What are you doing here?\" I ask him. \"Did you just break down my fucking door?\"\n My father\u0027s jaw clenches. \"That\u0027s what happens when you don\u0027t answer it for a week. Your girlfriend called me because she was worried. Get in the shower. We\u0027re going to talk.\"\n I glare at him. \"Fuck you. The time to talk was years ago. In fact, you\u0027ve had any number of chances over the years to talk. But you didn\u0027t. And now I don\u0027t want to talk. Get over it.\"\n I try to shove past him, to walk through to the kitchen, but he grabs my arm.\n His grip is strong and determined.\n \"Take a shower,\" he says slowly and deliberately. \"You smell like piss. Get clean clothes on and come back out here. We\u0027re going to talk. Now. Today.\"\n I stare at him and he stares back. He\u0027s not backing down. And I do smell like piss. Finally, I look away.\n \"Whatever. I do need a shower.\"\n I leave the room without looking back. I step into my shower and let the water run over me while my fucking head pounds. I can\u0027t remember if I drank any water this week at all. I actually don\u0027t remember much at all about this week. Every time I woke up, I simply took more pills and drank more whiskey.\n I wash, shave and get dressed.\n Then I make my way to the kitchen, where I chug two bottles of water. Even after that, my mouth is still dry so I must be pretty dehydrated. I take another bottle of water with me to the living room, where my father is waiting for me.\n He\u0027s cleaned the place up while he waited, picking up the empty bottles of whiskey from the floor. He\u0027s sitting in a chair now.\n He stares at me as I enter.\n He\u0027s grim and sober and I find that I suddenly don\u0027t want to have this conversation.\n \"Fuck this,\" I tell my dad. \"We haven\u0027t talked about this in years. I don\u0027t see the reason to talk about it now. The damage is done.\"\n My father looks at me.\n \"The damage has been done,\" he agrees. \"But there\u0027s no reason to make it worse. Let\u0027s talk.\"\n I sit down and take a swig of water.\n \"Fine. Why didn\u0027t you force me to talk about what happened?\"\n If we\u0027re going to talk, we might as well cut to the chase.\n My father stares at me, then his gaze drops to the floor.\n \"Because it was easier that way. I took you to a therapist and you wouldn\u0027t talk. I tried to get you to talk about it myself, you refused. And then I decided that maybe I really didn\u0027t want to know what happened. If it had scarred you so badly, then I wasn\u0027t sure that I could deal with it either. So I stopped trying. And then the therapist told me that he thought you had actually suppressed the memories, so it seemed to be for the best.\"\n I take another drink. My tongue feels thick from dehydration.\n \"Did they ever catch him?\"\n I cringe when my dad shakes his head. \"No. They didn\u0027t have a description to go on. None of the neighbors saw anything, they didn\u0027t see anyone coming or going. The police didn\u0027t have anything to work with.\"\n Fuck. Yet another reason to feel guilty. I could have given them a description.\n \"What happened that day?\" my dad asks. \"I need to know. There was gun residue on your hands. And you had that cut. But the police couldn\u0027t determine what happened, except your mother wasn\u0027t sexually violated. She had epithelial cells in her mouth, but no trace of semen. There was no match to the DNA sample in the police database. I know this is hard to think about or talk about. But what did you see?\"\n I close my eyes, squeezing them hard before I open them again. My dad is still staring at me, still waiting for answers.\n \"I heard mom crying. I found the guy in your room with a gun held to mom\u0027s side. The guy forced her to give him a blowjob. I tried to help, but when I did, I bumped the gun and it went off. She\u0027s dead because I tried to help. If I hadn\u0027t, she would still be here today.\"\n My father chokes a little and I try to swallow the fucking lump that keeps forming in my throat. He looks at me.\n \"Do you really think he would have left her alive?\" Dad finally says. \"Think about that, Pax. She knew what he looked like. If he told you that he wouldn\u0027t have killed her, he was lying.\"\n \"He left me alive,\" I tell him limply. \"Maybe he would have left her, too.\"\n My dad shakes his head, his cheeks flushed. \"No. He wouldn\u0027t have. He probably couldn\u0027t bring himself to kill a kid in cold blood and he felt confident enough that he\u0027d scared you into silence. Your mom never stood a chance, Pax. There wasn\u0027t anything you could\u0027ve done about it.\"\n He turns away now, staring out the window.\n \"But there\u0027s something you can do now. Now that you remember, come with me. Let\u0027s fly to Connecticut right now and sit down with the detective who handled the case. You can give him the description. What did the guy look like, anyway?\"\n I feel a chill run through me as I picture the guy\u0027s sneering face. \"He was skinny, with a gray ponytail and yellow teeth. Really yellow teeth. He was wearing a blue striped shirt.\"\n My father is frozen.\n \"I know who you are talking about. That was our mailman. I\u0027d never forget that gray ponytail or those horrible teeth. Pax, go pack a bag. We\u0027re going to Connecticut.\"\n \"The mailman?\" I am incredulous. \"I don\u0027t remember the mail man at all.\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t, would you?\" my dad answers. \"You were only seven. I used to tease your mother that he would find silly reasons to bring the mail to the door instead of leaving it in the box. I used to joke with her that he had a thing for her. We laughed about it. We thought he was just a little strange and lonely. I had no idea...\"\n Dad\u0027s voice chokes off and he looks away for a minute and pulls himself together before he looks back at me.\n \"Get your things, Pax. That sick bastard deserves to pay.\"\n The idea that I might find just a bit of redemption spurs me and I do get off the couch and go pack a bag. As I\u0027m cramming my toothbrush into my overnight case, I see a ring laying on the counter. I pick it up. Mila must\u0027ve left it. Her mother\u0027s wedding ring. I slide it onto my pinkie and finish packing.\n In my haste, I leave my cellphone in the house and don\u0027t realize it until we are speeding away toward Chicago.\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" my dad says. \"If you need a phone, you can use mine. We won\u0027t be gone that long anyway. Maybe a couple of days. This is huge, Pax. That fucking guy will finally get what he deserves. All they\u0027ll need to do is match his DNA. This is huge.\"\n My dad is more animated now than I\u0027ve ever seen him. There is life in his eyes. I look at him.\n \"Dad, why did you think it might be best if I never remembered? What did you mean? Best for me? Or best for you?\"\n My dad glances at me with a sober look before returning his eyes to the road.\n \"Maybe for both of us. I knew the memories would shatter you. And after they found the gunpowder residue on your hands, I didn\u0027t think I wanted to know what happened. I couldn\u0027t begin to imagine, but I wasn\u0027t in a good place. And if I\u0027d found out that you had a hand in her death, even accidentally, I didn\u0027t know if I could get past it.\"\n \"But I was a kid,\" I choke out. \"I was trying to help her.\"\n \"Yes,\" my dad says, leveling a gaze at me. \"You were. I\u0027m glad you realize that. But I was in a bad way then. Grief does that to a person. And so I coped in the only way I knew how. I threw myself into work. And when that didn\u0027t stop the pain, I packed us up and moved us across the country.\"\n \"Did that stop the pain?\" I ask him.\n He looks at me. \"No.\"\n I glance down at my hands and stare at the ring on my finger. I take it off, spinning it round and round in my hands. The inside has words inscribed. I peer closer to read them. Love Never Fails.\n I gulp.\n Sometimes, love does fail. I\u0027ve certainly proven that. I\u0027ve failed everyone. I failed my mother. I failed my father when I repressed the memories and couldn\u0027t tell anyone what the killer looked like. And I\u0027ve certainly failed Mila. I know I\u0027ve ripped her heart out and I doubt I can ever put it back together again.\n I close my eyes to soothe the stinging in them.\n I nap in the airport until our plane takes off, then I nap on the plane. I think about trying to call Mila, but decide that I\u0027d better not. Our conversation isn\u0027t one for the phone. I\u0027ll need to see her, face-to-face. In the meantime, I have something important to do.\n When we touch down in Hartford, we check into a hotel. Our dinner in the posh hotel restaurant is fairly silent.\n I watch my father swirling his scotch absently in his glass for a long time before I finally speak up.\n \"It wasn\u0027t your fault, either, dad.\"\n He looks up at me.\n \"No? Pax, we joked about that guy. The fucking mailman. I thought he was a joke. But he took my life away. Or he might as well have. Some joke. I guess he got the last laugh.\"\n The bitter agony on my father\u0027s face is apparent and as pissed as I am at him, I can\u0027t help but feel terrible for him at the same time. I can\u0027t imagine what he must feel like.\n \"Dad,\" I attempt again. But he interrupts.\n \"Pax, you don\u0027t understand. You can\u0027t imagine how many times over the years I\u0027ve wondered...what if I had left work early that day? What if I\u0027d not stopped for gas? What if I\u0027d hit one less red light? If any of those things had happened, maybe I could have stopped it. The constant not-knowing was terrible. But now, to find out that the fucking mailman took her life...my guilt is ten thousand times worse than it ever was. Because if I\u0027d taken him seriously- if I\u0027d recognized him for the perverted fuck that he was, your mother would be alive today. That\u0027s an unarguable fact.\"\n I gulp down the rest of my water before I answer.\n \"Dad, mom must not have realized how fucked up he was, either. You said you both joked about it. That means that he hid it pretty well. You can\u0027t feel guilty for someone else\u0027s mental illness. There\u0027s no way that you could have known.\"\n I can tell my father doesn\u0027t believe me, though and we finish our meal in silence. To be honest, I think we both are happy to be alone with our thoughts.\n After a fairly sleepless night, we go the police station first thing in the morning. The detective is more than happy to hear from us.\n \"This case has haunted me for years,\" he admits to me, his mouth tight. \"I\u0027d never seen anything like it. I\u0027ve never forgotten it, or the sight of your little face. Your eyes were so big and sad. You\u0027d seen the unimaginable. I\u0027m glad to see you\u0027ve grown up so well.\"\n So well. Huh. That\u0027s debatable.\n He takes my official statement and assures us that they will be pursuing a warrant to collect DNA evidence from our old mailman as soon as they can get a name from Post Office records. I feel a feeling of intense satisfaction as we walk down the steps of the station and out into the brisk, fresh air.\n Justice might finally be served. My mom might finally be vindicated. It\u0027s only taken seventeen years.\n \"Where is she buried?\" I ask my father as we climb into the car. He looks at me.\n \"Let\u0027s stop and get some flowers, and I\u0027ll show you.\"\n So we do exactly that. We stop and get two dozen roses apiece and we drive to a beautiful, silent cemetery. It is lined with trees and the ice hangs on the branches, sparkling in the winter sun. It\u0027s serene. I decide that if you must be buried, it might as well be here in this tranquil place.\n As we walk among the graves, I feel as though I\u0027ve been here before and I know that I have. I have fleeting glimpses of her funeral, of the casket being lowered into the ground. I remember the intense feeling of sadness that I had felt watching it.\n I swallow hard.\n Ahead of us, I see a statue of an angel and I recognize it. It is lying across a slab, weeping into its hands and I know that it sits next to my mother\u0027s grave. I remember it.\n \"Your grandfather had the statue brought in,\" my father says, nodding toward it.\n \"It seems fitting,\" I answer. And it does.\n My mother\u0027s headstone sits next to the angel, made from white marble. It\u0027s gleaming and bright. I turn to my dad. \"Someone\u0027s been taking care of it.\"\n He nods. \"Of course. I pay someone.\"\n Of course.\n I stare down.\n Susanna Alexander Tate\n Beloved wife and mother\n She walked in beauty,\n She sleeps in peace.\n The cold wind blows gently against my face and once again, a knot forms in my throat. I am flooded with guilt that I haven\u0027t been here to visit her in years. I kneel to place my flowers by her name and for the first time in as long as I can remember; I feel a tear streaking my cheek. I wipe it away.\n \"Do you think she is? At peace?\"\n My father looks at me.\n \"Son, you were your mother\u0027s peace. You brought her so much peace and joy from the very first time she held you, that she knew she had to name you Pax. Your mother loved you more than anything in the world. She would have gladly given her life a hundred times over to keep you safe. Whatever you do, just live a good life for her. She had so many hopes for you. But when it boils down to it, all she would want is for you to be happy.\"\n The tears flow freely now and my father wraps his arms around me. And just like that, two grown men stand embracing in front of a lonely headstone.\n It is a few minutes before he pulls away and I see that he is crying too.\n \"I love you, too, Pax. I hope you know that.\"\n I nod, too choked up to speak. I feel as though someone has twisted my guts in their hands and shoved them back down my throat into all the wrong places. Everything hurts. But for the first time, the pain is okay. The pain feels normal, like it\u0027s the kind I should feel. It doesn\u0027t feel like the shameful pain that I felt as a kid, back when I couldn\u0027t save my mom.\n The old void in my heart is gone. It has been replaced with a quiet sort of acceptance. My life is what it is. My mom died a violent death and I watched it happen. I\u0027ve got to get past it and move forward. It\u0027s what she would want me to do.\n Standing here, in front of her grave in this serene place, I know now that I couldn\u0027t have saved her. I was seven years old. My father was right. The intruder would\u0027ve killed her regardless. It was his plan all along or he wouldn\u0027t have even brought the gun.\n We ride back to the airport in silence.\n Finally, my father speaks. \"You should call Mila. She\u0027s been very worried about you.\"\n I look at him in surprise. \"She said that to you?\"\n He nods. \"She\u0027s the reason I came to your house, remember? She called me or I wouldn\u0027t have known that things were so bad. She loves you, Pax. And if there\u0027s anything that you should take away from this is that you need to live for today. Tomorrow is not promised to you.\"\n \"I don\u0027t deserve her,\" I tell him honestly. \"I\u0027ve been an asshole. All I\u0027ve done is hurt her.\"\n My father looks at me doubtfully. \"If that were true, then she wouldn\u0027t love you so much. She\u0027s waiting for you. She\u0027s checked on you a hundred times and has asked me a million questions that I don\u0027t know the answers to. Only you do. You need to answer them for her.\"\n \"Such as?\"\n \"Such as, are you coming back? Are you going to be okay? How are you handling things now? Things that you don\u0027t talk about so I don\u0027t know. You\u0027re going to have to get some help figuring out how to deal with uncomfortable things. You can\u0027t keep burying things in drugs and whiskey. You know that.\"\n I nod. And it\u0027s painful because it\u0027s true.\n \"I\u0027ve fucked up,\" I say simply.\n \"Yes,\" my father agrees. \"But haven\u0027t we all?\"\n I don\u0027t answer. I slip away into my thoughts and continue to twirl Mila\u0027s ring on my finger. As we make our way through the airport, dad turns to me.\n \"I\u0027m going to tell your grandfather that you remember. It\u0027s one of the reasons that he stopped talking to us. He didn\u0027t agree with me not forcing you to think about it because he wanted your mother\u0027s killer found. When I refused to try and force you, he couldn\u0027t bring himself to go along with the lies that I told you, that your mother died in a car-crash. His absence isn\u0027t his fault, it\u0027s mine. The blame rests on my shoulders. And I\u0027m sorry.\"\n I nod. To be honest, I\u0027ll worry about that later. It\u0027s the last thing I\u0027m worried about right now. There\u0027s only one face in my mind and it is beautiful and soft and has wide, green eyes.\n Our plane touches down in Chicago and my father drives me home.\n \"I hope things will get better for us now, Pax,\" he tells me in my driveway and I can see that he is sincere. I nod.\n \"I hope so too,\" I answer. I find that I mean it. It will take a while, I\u0027m sure. We can\u0027t fix years of damage to our relationship in a minute. But at least it\u0027s a start. If we keep at it, maybe someday we\u0027ll be okay again.\n He backs out and I watch until I can no longer see his red taillights before I drop into Danger and speed for town. I can only think of one thing.\n Her.\n I burst into the door of her shop and she looks up in surprise from the counter. She is alone and seems to be studying a portfolio. As I walk in and she recognizes me, at first her expression leaps. In joy.\n But it quickly becomes guarded and I feel the sting of that all the way into the center of my heart. I did that to her. I taught her to be guarded and protective around me because I might crush her. That knowledge kills me.\n I stride across the store, not stopping, not hesitating. I step around the counter and smash her to me tightly.\n \"Please,\" I tell her. \"Please forgive me. I\u0027m so sorry that I hurt you. I\u0027m so sorry that I\u0027ve been an asshole and that I shut you out. I didn\u0027t know how to handle things without being self-destructive. Self-destruction is all I\u0027ve ever known. Deep down, it\u0027s what I felt like I deserved.\"\n I pause and look down. She\u0027s staring up at me with her gorgeous, clear eyes and my gut clenches.\n \"Give me another chance,\" I ask urgently. \"I will do anything that you want me to do if you just tell me that we can start again. I know I don\u0027t deserve it, but I\u0027m asking anyway. I honestly don\u0027t know if I can breathe without you. Please. I love you, Mila. Please tell me we can work it out.\"\n I stare into her eyes and she seems uncertain and I feel a moment of panic.\n \"I don\u0027t want to start over again,\" she says slowly. \"I like what we had. I don\u0027t want to re-do it. I love you, Pax. But I don\u0027t know if I can handle it if you leave me like that again. You shut me out and I couldn\u0027t help you. That\u0027s not what people do when they love someone. You ripped my heart out and stomped on it.\"\n \"I know,\" I agree. \"I know that. You have no idea how sorry I am. I\u0027m just not that good at relationships. I haven\u0027t had any practice. But if you stay with me, if you stay... I promise that I will never leave you again. I will never shut you out again. I\u0027ll put in the work and I\u0027ll fix what is broken. I promise.\"\n \"I want to believe you,\" she says slowly, her eyes still frozen on mine. \"But I\u0027m too afraid, Pax. You scared me. A lot. How do I know that you won\u0027t shut me out like that again? How do I know that the next difficult thing we come across won\u0027t send you into another tailspin and I\u0027ll find you on the back yard, like we found Jill?\"\n She pauses, her eyes pleading, wanting me to say something, wanting me to argue that she\u0027s wrong. But I don\u0027t know that she is. So I can\u0027t say anything.\n \"Jill\u0027s two babies are in foster care now, Pax. Their whole lives have been shattered. I don\u0027t know that I can trust you not to do that to me. I haven\u0027t slept in days and when I do sleep, I have horrible nightmares. I\u0027m a wreck, Pax. And I don\u0027t want to go through this again. I just don\u0027t think I can.\"\n Her words terrify me and I pull off the ring, holding it out with a shaking hand.\n \"Love never fails, Mila. That\u0027s what your parents believed. And because of you, it\u0027s what I believe now, too. You stuck by me and loved me when I didn\u0027t deserve it. All I want is a chance to prove that I can be worthy of it. Your parents were sort of fucked up in their own way, like me, and they never got the help that they needed. But I will. I promise. I will put the work in. I will learn how to cope with painful things and I will never leave you again. Just tell me that you\u0027ll stay with me.\"\n I stare at her, waiting, holding my breath.\n \"Please,\" I whisper.\n Finally, finally, she takes the ring from my hand and leans on her tiptoes, pressing her lips to mine, ever so softly.\n \"I love you so much,\" she whispers. \"I love you so much. But I can\u0027t. Not right now.\"\n A vice-grip crushes my heart as I stare at her; at the face that is so beautiful and delicate, at the woman who has seen me at my worst but is still standing in front of me today without judgment or derision. My chest tightens and my eyes burn. I feel utterly empty.\n \"I know,\" I tell her, honestly. \"I understand.\"\n And I do.\n It is a truth so raw and honest that it hurts. But I haven\u0027t given her a reason to stay so there is no way that she should. There\u0027s only one thing that I can do...give her one.\n I swallow hard, willing the lump in my throat to dissipate.\n \"I\u0027ll give you a reason,\" I tell her, my voice raw. \"I promise. If you give me the chance, I will give you a reason to be with me.\"\n She kisses me again and I fight the urge to inhale her, to crush her to my chest and never let go, to force her to stay.\n \"I\u0027m counting on that,\" Mila murmurs as she steps away. \"I just need some time Pax; time for you to show that you are serious about this, about putting the work in. That\u0027s all I need.\"\n I know this is as hard for her as it is for me and I hate that I did this to her. I hate that I put that hurt on her face.\n I nod slowly and the movement seems painful.\n \"You can have all the time that you need, Mila. I\u0027ll wait forever if I have to.\"\n A tear slips down her cheek and she looks away. My gut feels like a cement block as I use my thumb to wipe her tear, then to pull her chin up.\n I kiss her cheek. \"I love you,\" I murmur into her ear.\n And then I gather every ounce of my strength, because that\u0027s what it takes to walk away from her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-24.html","bookId":2758,"book":{"id":2758,"title":"If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1)","description":"Storyline: \n If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1) \n 24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole. \n Seriously. \n He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. \n But he’s got his reasons. \n His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why.
