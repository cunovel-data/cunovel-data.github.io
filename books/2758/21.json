{"id":84804,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Pax\\n\\n I am numb. Utterly frozen as I watch the doctor write out another prescription for Xanax and hand it to Mila. She promises to have it filled in case I need it. He tells her that I shouldn\u0027t be alone and she agrees. She won\u0027t leave me, she says.\\n\\n I can\u0027t imagine why not- not after what she heard today. I\u0027ve always told her that I\u0027m fucked up. But this... this is fucked up.\\n\\n The doctor spent an extra hour talking with me after I woke up, but I can\u0027t remember anything that he said. It was all words and blurs and noise. Static. It doesn\u0027t matter. There\u0027s nothing that he can say that will help. He has to know that.\\n\\n Mila grasps my elbow. \"Ready?\"\\n\\n I nod and we walk silently out to the car. My feet feel wooden.\\n\\n \"Want me to drive?\" she asks as she looks up at me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m good,\" I tell her as I open her door automatically. I\u0027m on auto-pilot now. I\u0027m moving, but not feeling. Mila slides in and looks up at me again. I don\u0027t know what she\u0027s waiting for. I close the door.\\n\\n I buckle in and sit still for a second, staring at the snow in front of us. Everything seems to be a blur to me. Blurs of movement, blurs of shapes. Colors that bleed into each other. Nothing makes sense.\\n\\n \"Pax,\" Mila whispers. I can feel her eyes on me, waiting for something. What the fuck is she waiting for? But I don\u0027t ask. She leans over and embraces me, wrapping her arms around my shoulders and burying her face in my neck. I don\u0027t feel her warmth. I\u0027m too numb.\\n\\n \"It will be okay,\" she finally whispers as she pulls away. She\u0027s wiping her tears away and I wonder why I\u0027m not crying. I\u0027m the one who should be, but my emotions seem to be gone. I can\u0027t feel a thing.\\n\\n As I start the car up and drive, the silence yawns between Mila and I. I keep my eyes on the road, unable to focus or concentrate. I feel numb, every bit as numb as I felt after I dove in the lake after Mila. My heart is like a block of ice; frozen, suspended.\\n\\n \"Pax,\" she murmurs, staring at me. I can feel her gaze, her soft expression. I don\u0027t want to see it though, so I don\u0027t look. I don\u0027t deserve it. I don\u0027t deserve her goodness.\\n\\n \"We should talk about this.\" Her voice is soft, but insistent.\\n\\n She puts her hand on my leg. Her fingers are cold. Normally, I would grasp it, hold it, tuck it into mine to warm it. Not now. I don\u0027t deserve to touch her with the same hands that killed my mother. So, I keep mine clenched on the steering wheel and I stare at my scar. It is jagged and deep, the edges of it white.\\n\\n I have marked you.\\n\\n In my head, I remember the man with the yellow teeth tracing my mother\u0027s blood into the cut. My mother\u0027s blood is literally on my hands. It\u0027s engrained in my skin forever. I have marked you.\\n\\n I swallow. \"I killed my mother. There\u0027s nothing else to say. In my dreams, I kept thinking that she was begging me to do something. But she wasn\u0027t. She was begging for me. For my life.\"\\n\\n Everything seems like it is closing in on me and I suddenly feel incredibly hot. I breathe deeply, sucking in air. The white of the snow and the sky seem to be swirling around me and I can\u0027t see straight. I pull over and crack my window, and then I stare into the distance as I try to get things under control; my heart beat, my breathing, my thoughts.\\n\\n Mila is silent.\\n\\n I can tell she doesn\u0027t know what to do.\\n\\n \"Pax,\" she tries. \"There\u0027s everything to say. You know it wasn\u0027t your fault. He was the one with the gun, the one who was forcing a violent act upon your mother. It wasn\u0027t you. I love you. I\u0027ll do anything you need me to do. Just name it. We can get through this.\"\\n\\n Her words fade away and I stare into the silent winter day.\\n\\n I can\u0027t believe the world is going on just the same as it was this morning, like nothing happened. Crows are perched in a nearby tree and I can hear them cawing. I briefly wonder why they haven\u0027t flown south, but I really don\u0027t give a fuck. The snow drifts across the road; and down the way, I see a snowplow coming slowly, it\u0027s yellow lights blinking in the slush. People are bundled up on the sidewalk, leaning into the cold winter. Everything is cold. The day, the wind, the lump in my throat.\\n\\n I swallow hard, but it won\u0027t go down.\\n\\n I shake my head and start the car again, driving to my house. The road passes behind us in a gray blur.\\n\\n After my tires crunch on the snow in my driveway, I turn to Mila.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to be good company today. I think I should probably just be alone.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s already shaking her head.\\n\\n \"Not on your life. I won\u0027t bother you, Pax. But the doctor said you shouldn\u0027t be alone. So you do whatever you\u0027d like. You think about things, you process it however you\u0027d like, but I\u0027m staying. I\u0027m just going to run into town and get your prescription filled and I\u0027ll be right back.\"\\n\\n I nod curtly, and go into the house. I don\u0027t look back, even though I can feel Mila staring at me.\\n\\n I stand in the middle of my living room, limply. I don\u0027t know what to do. I don\u0027t know how to process this. How would anyone process this?\\n\\n And then, all of a sudden, I think about my father and a white-hot rage passes through me, overcoming the numbness.\\n\\n He knew about this. He\u0027s known all of these years and he didn\u0027t tell me. He allowed me to suppress the memories. He had to know what it would do to me.\\n\\n But everything makes sense now. No wonder he had stayed at work for such long hours after mom died. He didn\u0027t want to see me. How in the world could he have looked into my face knowing that I had killed his wife? Or even if he didn\u0027t realize the part I played, at the very least he knows that I didn\u0027t save her.\\n\\n But even still. I was a kid. My logical thought tells me that Mila is right. It wasn\u0027t my fault. But I was the one who was there. It was my hand that bumped the man\u0027s gun. And it was my father who allowed me to hide it all of these years.\\n\\n I punch his number into my house phone, but of course, he doesn\u0027t pick up. I leave him a voice mail.\\n\\n \"I know what happened to mom,\" I say icily. \"Call me.\"\\n\\n I hang up and throw my phone against the wall. It shatters into pieces. I guess if he wants to call, he\u0027ll have to call my cell.\\n\\n Self-loathe floods through me, swirling with the anger that I feel toward my father. All of a sudden, I am consumed with so much emotion that I don\u0027t know what to do with it all. It\u0027s overwhelming. And it fucking hurts.\\n\\n I head to the kitchen and grab a bottle of whiskey. I glance into the cabinet and see that I have two more. Thank god I re-stocked the other day. I gulp a few drinks, then a few more. Thankfully, the familiar haze soon descends upon me, the quiet numbness that I enjoy so much. But it\u0027s not enough.\\n\\n The ache is still there.\\n\\n Fuck. This.\\n\\n I take the stairs two at a time and change into sweats, a sweatshirt and running shoes. Without another thought, I dart out the back of the house, jogging down the path to the beach. The sand is packed and frozen into hard ripples that hurt the bottom of my feet.\\n\\n I don\u0027t care. I deserve it.\\n\\n I jog at a fast clip, sucking in the cold air that burns my lungs.\\n\\n I don\u0027t care. I deserve it.\\n\\n The lake swirls and crashes against the shore on my right as my feet beat angrily on the rigid beach. The wind blowing from the water is frigid and wet and I suck it in, inhaling it into numb body. Flecks of the icy water hit my face and drip onto my shirt, freezing there.\\n\\n I stare into the distance, not noticing as the beach falls away under my feet. I don\u0027t even know how far I go, until at last I can no longer breathe. My fucking lungs hurt so much and there is still a fucking lump in my throat, lodged so tightly that no amount of swallowing or running or heavy breathing will move it.\\n\\n \"Fuuuuccckkkkk!\"\\n\\n I turn and shout at the lake, screaming as loud as I can. The vibration of it rips against my vocal chords, bruising them in the cold.\\n\\n But I don\u0027t care. I fucking deserve it. I shout again and again, until my voice grows hoarse. And then I drop onto the beach, leaning against a big piece of driftwood. I am limp and spent. My forehead is somehow sweaty, even though it is cold outside. The cold wind blows against it, giving me chills.\\n\\n But I don\u0027t care.\\n\\n I fucking deserve it.\\n\\n I deserve to get pneumonia and die out here in the cold.\\n\\n I stare blankly at the lake now, trying to tune out rational thought or logic or memories or emotion. I don\u0027t even know how long I\u0027ve been here or how much time passes before I see someone making their way down the beach. I see a flash of red and a long coat.\\n\\n Mila.\\n\\n I can just barely see the neck of her red turtleneck sweater poking out of her heavy coat. She trudges along the beach, her slim form bent against the wind. I can tell when she sees me because her pace quickens and it only takes her a minute more to reach me.\\n\\n \"Pax,\" she shouts. \"Oh my god. Thank god. What are you thinking? It\u0027s cold out here. You\u0027re going to get pneumonia.\"\\n\\n I stare up at her. It\u0027s the weirdest feeling, but I simply don\u0027t care about anything. I don\u0027t care if I catch pneumonia. It wouldn\u0027t bother me at all.\\n\\n She leans down and grabs my hand, pulling me to my feet.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" she tells me. \"We\u0027re going back to the house. You don\u0027t even have a coat on.\"\\n\\n And I don\u0027t care. But I don\u0027t tell Mila that. I just let her lead me to the house, up the stairs and into the kitchen.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re frozen,\" she says, turning to me. Her face is stricken as she strips off her coat and tosses it onto a chair. \"I\u0027m going to run you a hot bath. You have to warm up.\"\\n\\n She disappears down the hall and I remain standing limply in place.\\n\\n Nothing matters.\\n\\n Not anymore.\\n\\n I know now what the void was that was always in me. It was this. This horrible knowledge. Even though my mind was concealing it, deep down in a hidden place, I knew. It\u0027s why I\u0027ve always felt empty, why I always welcomed oblivion.\\n\\n Only now, the void isn\u0027t empty. It\u0027s filled with overwhelming pain and guilt. And I don\u0027t know what to do about it. I feel like I\u0027m being pulled under.\\n\\n Mila comes back and seems surprised that I haven\u0027t moved. She looks at me uncertainly, her green eyes liquid. She doesn\u0027t say anything though. She just grabs my hand and tugs me to the bathroom. She pulls off my clothes and kicks them into a pile on the floor.\\n\\n \"Get in,\" she instructs me firmly. \"Your skin is bright red.\"\\n\\n I obediently step into the tub, even though I haven\u0027t taken a bath since I was small. The hot water sends a thousand needles prickling through my limbs, but I don\u0027t care. I settle into the tub and close my eyes, blocking out everything.\\n\\n \"Pax,\" Mila begins. But then she changes her mind. \"Never mind. I\u0027ll check on you soon. I have your prescription, but since you drank so much whiskey, I don\u0027t think you should take it.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n When I open my eyes a moment later, she is gone. I close them again.\\n\\n The problem is, when my eyes are closed, I see her face. My mother\u0027s.\\n\\n Her eyes are wide open and staring at me. Dead. I did that to her. It was me. The guy wasn\u0027t going to kill her - I bumped his finger on the trigger.\\n\\n It was all my fault.\\n\\n Pain rips through me and I lurch to my feet, punching the tiled wall. I don\u0027t even feel that pain- the pain in my chest far overshadows it. I grab a towel and dry off, pulling my underwear on.\\n\\n I\u0027ve got to do something.\\n\\n I can\u0027t live like this.\\n\\n Mila\\n\\n As Pax soaks, I put some water on for tea. As I do, his cell phone rings on the counter. I glance at it and see Paul Tate\u0027s name. I reach for it hesitantly. Should I answer it? My gut says yes.\\n\\n \"Hello?\" I am still uncertain.\\n\\n \"Hello,\" a surprised Paul Tate answers. \"Is Pax available? This is his father.\"\\n\\n \"Just a moment,\" I tell him. I want to say so much more, but I don\u0027t. I just climb the stairs to the bathroom and open the door, only to find the room empty. The tub is still full of water, but Pax isn\u0027t here.\\n\\n Hell.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not where I thought he was,\" I tell his dad. \"I\u0027ll have to find him.\"\\n\\n I start walking down the hall, but Paul interrupts me.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" he says. \"How is he? I received a voicemail from him. He said he\u0027s remembered what happened to his mother.\"\\n\\n Anger rips through me. This man concealed this stuff from Pax for years. He had to know that it was going to come bubbling to the surface at some point. Didn\u0027t he care about that? Didn\u0027t he care what it was doing to Pax all along?\\n\\n \"How do you think he\u0027s doing?\" I ask coolly. \"Not well. Nobody would handle it well.\"\\n\\n There is a loud sigh on the other end.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve always been afraid of this day,\" Paul admits and he sounds distant and sad. \"I\u0027ve never known what to do, how to prevent it.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t prevent it,\" I tell him incredulously. \"Pax saw something tragic and devastating. He should have dealt with it years ago with the help of a therapist. To allow him to suppress it was unforgivable. I\u0027m sorry. I don\u0027t know you and I\u0027m sorry to judge, but I know him. And he didn\u0027t deserve this. Any of this.\"\\n\\n There is a long silence. Finally Paul speaks again.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand. After Susanna died, Pax refused to speak of it. I did hire a therapist and Pax refused to speak to him. He had nightmares, but he would never describe them or tell me what they were about. I couldn\u0027t help him because he wouldn\u0027t let me.\"\\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t talk about it because the man who killed your wife threatened Pax. He told him that he would hunt him down and kill him, that if he spoke of it to anyone, that Pax would go to jail for killing his own mother. As you can imagine, he\u0027s not dealing with it well. At all.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think I should come?\" Paul sounds hesitant. I am appalled and shocked. If it was me and Pax was my child, I would be here immediately. I wouldn\u0027t ask, I wouldn\u0027t take no for an answer. But Paul Tate is hesitating. I can\u0027t believe it.\\n\\n \"You do whatever you feel you need to,\" I tell him angrily before I hang up on him. I know I didn\u0027t make the best first impression with Pax\u0027s father, but I don\u0027t care. How can he be so selfish?\\n\\n As I gather my wits, I hear a thumping sound, loud and frequent.\\n\\n Whump.\\n\\n Whump.\\n\\n Whump.\\n\\n I crane my ears and follow the noise. It\u0027s coming from downstairs in the basement. Curious, I pad lightly down the wooden stairs and find Pax in his underwear, punching a punching bag that is hanging from a ceiling beam. I didn\u0027t even know it was down here. But then, I\u0027ve never had a reason to be down here before.\\n\\n He\u0027s sweaty and his muscles bulge and flex as he repeatedly punches at the bag. Over and over, with all of his strength. He doesn\u0027t even notice that I\u0027m standing here watching him. He\u0027s focused solely in front of him.\\n\\n Whump.\\n\\n Whump.\\n\\n Whump.\\n\\n My heart feels shredded and I suck in a breath. I don\u0027t know what to do. I don\u0027t know how to help him. I tiptoe back up the stairs and slide to the floor, sitting against the wall. I can hear him still, punching. Over and over and over. I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s going to hurt himself, or tear a muscle. But I know he won\u0027t stop, not even if I ask him.\\n\\n I sit for at least another hour, my elbows on my knees, my face in my hands. And then the pounding finally stops. There is silence and then there are footsteps on the stairs.\\n\\n I look up just as Pax emerges.\\n\\n He looks down at me, then bends down and scoops me up.\\n\\n He\u0027s sweaty, but I don\u0027t care. I lean my face against his chest.\\n\\n Wordlessly, he carries me up the stairs and into the bedroom where he strips off his underwear and reaches for me. I\u0027m surprised, but I fold into his arms. If this is the way he needs comforted, then so be it. I\u0027ll do anything to take the hurt off of his face.\\n\\n His lips crush mine, hard. I kiss him back, but I quickly realize that this isn\u0027t going to be our normal sex. This is hard and primal. Anguished. He bends me onto the bed, and slides into me from behind with no foreplay. I wince just a bit, but it doesn\u0027t take long until I am wet.\\n\\n He slides in and out; hard, rough, fast.\\n\\n He grips my ass and thrusts harder.\\n\\n My hands grip the comforter on the bed and I stare at it. Pax isn\u0027t really here with me. This isn\u0027t him. This is just him trying to block everything out. I know that, even if he isn\u0027t telling me.\\n\\n It doesn\u0027t take long before he shudders against me; straining, pushing.\\n\\n He falls with me to the bed and when I look at him, for just a second, it is Pax again. His eyes are open and wide.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he tells me softly, clutching me. \"I\u0027m so sorry. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know who he is really apologizing to, me or maybe even his mom. I just don\u0027t know. But I don\u0027t care. I stroke his back as he shakes until he finally is still. He lies there for the longest time before he climbs out of bed and closes the bedroom door behind him.\\n\\n I don\u0027t follow. I know he wants to be alone. And for the life of me, I don\u0027t know how to help him. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-21.html","bookId":2758,"book":{"id":2758,"title":"If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1)","description":"Storyline: If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1) \\n 24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole. \\n Seriously. \\n He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. \\n But he’s got his reasons. \\n His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why.
