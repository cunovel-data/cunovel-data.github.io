{"id":84810,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Twelve Months Later Mila The letter that I hold in my hands is old and yellowed and precious. Tears blur my vision as I read it and I slowly wipe them away, careful not to smudge my makeup. I set it aside and look up at my sister. \"So much has happened this year,\" I say softly. Maddy nods in agreement. \"Yeah,\" she agrees with a laugh. \"Who would have thought that I\u0027d actually grow to love Pax?\" I roll my eyes. \"How could you not? He\u0027s amazing. He\u0027s done everything that he promised he would.\" And he did. True to his word, Pax continued to see Dr. Tyler. He put in so much work on changing the way he handles things and communicates that I couldn\u0027t be prouder of him, and our relationship couldn\u0027t be more healthy or whole. He\u0027s beautiful, inside and out. He completely gave up whiskey and drugs. The only thing he touches now is wine at dinner, with me. \"I can\u0027t believe he gave up Jack Daniels,\" Madison says wryly, shaking her head. \"That blew me away. Especially when all of that legal stuff was going on with his mother\u0027s killer. It was so stressful. But he never even blinked. He didn\u0027t mess up once. I have to say, I\u0027m impressed with him, Sis. Truly.\" I nod absently, thinking about how hard that \u0027legal stuff\u0027 had been for Pax to deal with. Leroy Ellison is the name of the mail man who violated Susanna Tate. DNA evidence proved it within a 99.900% level of accuracy and Pax identified him in a line-up, in addition to describing the snake tattoo on Leroy\u0027s hip. Leroy is in jail now, awaiting trial. The Tate family attorneys don\u0027t expect the trial to last long, since the evidence is conclusive. \"And then, for his grandpa to turn up and try to make amends... Pax had so much pressure from every direction. I thought for sure he\u0027d slip up. But he didn\u0027t,\" Madison says, staring at me. I have to admit, I had been a little nervous too. When William Alexander had showed up at Pax\u0027s lake house and wanted to talk, I thought all kinds of shit was going to hit the fan. But he and Pax had taken a walk and talked through things. And over the course of the past year, as Pax\u0027s head became clearer and less clouded by his past hurt, he had decided to take an interest in the family company. He will someday take it over when his grandfather dies. In the meantime, he is working from a home-office at the lake. He is learning the business and has met with his grandfather several times. In one of those meetings, his grandfather gave him an old box of letters, written from his mother to Pax, beginning with the day he was born. Maddy nods toward the letter sitting beside me. \"What\u0027s the deal with that letter, anyway?\" \"Apparently,\" I explain, \"When Paul moved Pax to Chicago, he left a bunch of Susanna\u0027s stuff in their old house. He just couldn\u0027t bring himself to throw it out. Pax\u0027s grandfather sorted through it for him and when he did, he found a box of letters in Susanna\u0027s closet. \"I guess, when she was pregnant, she got emotional and hormonal and had decided to start writing Pax letters for special occasions in his life, in case anything ever happened to her. Paul said he teased her about it, but she did it anyway. It turned out, her foresight was a good idea.\" \"Oh my god,\" Maddy breathes. \"That gives me goose bumps. It\u0027s amazing.\" I nod. \"I know. William kept them for Pax all of these years.\" \"Why did Pax want me to bring you that one this morning?\" Maddy asks curiously. I flip it over and hold it up for her to see. She obviously hadn\u0027t looked at it when she carried it in to me. The envelope is labeled, For Pax on his wedding day. His wedding day is today. Maddy\u0027s eyes widen. \"Oh, wow. What does it say?\" My fingers shake as I read through the elegant writing once again, this time aloud for Madison. I struggle not to cry, because the words are just so beautiful. To my beautiful son, Looking at you now, as you toddle about my garden collecting caterpillars, I can\u0027t imagine a day when you will be grown, when you will be a man. I can\u0027t imagine a day when your tiny chubby hands will grow into big, slender ones like your father\u0027s and that you will be one day be big enough to find a woman that you love. But I know that day will come, because days like that always do. You will be big and strong and beautiful and your wife will be lucky to have you. And you will be lucky to have her, too. Because anyone who captures your heart will be beautiful and amazing, as well. You will suit each other in every way. That is my hope for you. If you\u0027re reading this, then I am not there with you. But I want you to know that my heart is there. My love is there. My love will always live on in you. And when you hold your children and your grandchildren, my love will pass through you to them, because love is never-ending. It goes on and on and on. My beautiful son, I love you. I hope that your married life is full of wonder and laughter and love. You deserve all of that and more. Please know that I am very proud of the man you have become. I know that even now, even as you are still a boy. I know it because of the potential that I already see in your eyes. Pax, don\u0027t be upset that I\u0027m gone. I believe in heaven, in a wonderful place full of forgiveness and love, and because of that, I know that I will see you again someday. Until that day, may your wife keep you happy and safe and loved. All my love, Forever, Your mother My tears drip onto the fragile paper and I yank it away. I can\u0027t ruin this letter. It has to be put away and saved, so that our children can read it someday. Love never fails. It is a sentiment that has become a pledge for Pax and me. In fact, it is inscribed in our weddings rings that we will exchange today. And in this most perfect of letters, his mom has echoed that thought. His mother, the woman who gave her life to protect her son because she loved him that much. And I do too. I recognize that truth as I put the letter away and adjust my veil in the mirror. I love Pax more than life itself. Like his mother, I would protect him with my life. Wherever Susanna Tate is, I hope she knows that. \"Are you okay?\" Madison asks quietly as I wipe away the little smudge under my eye. I nod. \"I\u0027m fine. It\u0027s just beautiful. I hope that I live up to her expectations of me.\" Madison smiles and adjusts my dress. \"Of course you will. You\u0027re amazing, just like she said you would be.\" Warmth wells up in me and as I\u0027m hugging my sister, Tony sticks his head in the door. He\u0027s wearing a tux...to walk me down the aisle in lieu of my dad. \"Are you ready?\" he asks as he holds out his elbow. I nod and Madison kneels to gather my long, white train. Of course I\u0027m ready. I\u0027ve never been more ready. As we position ourselves in the back of the church, the church that I have seen so many times in my dreams, I am filled with hope and boundless joy. This church that housed my parents\u0027 funeral is also hosting my wedding, illustrating once again that life is full of all kinds of good and bad. Pax and I have been through it all and we\u0027ll continue to go through it, because that\u0027s how life works. I stare at Pax and suddenly, I am filled with peace. Like his mother before me, he is my peace now. His eyes meet mine and he smiles, beautiful and radiant in the morning sunshine as he waits for me at the front. He\u0027s so handsome, so tall and strong, that it takes my breath away. I take a breath. The music starts. Each step that I take brings me closer to him. And when I finally get there, his fingers entwine with mine. I look up into his eyes, eager to become his. I repeat my vows after the minister and end with, \"I will love you all of the days of my life.\" And I know that I will. Because true love never fails. It never dies. It just goes on and on and on. Forever.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-27.html","bookId":2758,"book":{"id":2758,"title":"If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1)","description":"Storyline: If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1) 24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole. Seriously. He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. But he’s got his reasons. His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why. What he does know is that he and his dad are left alone and with more issues than they can count. As Pax grew up, he tried to be the kid his father always wanted; the perfect golden boy, but it didn’t work. His dad couldn’t overcome his grief long enough to notice and Pax couldn’t keep up the impossible perfect façade. So he slipped far, far from it. Now, he uses drugs and women to cope with the ugliness, the black void that he doesn’t want to deal with. If he pretends that the emptiness isn’t there, then it isn’t, right? Wrong. And it’s never more apparent than when he meets Mila. Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart. He doesn’t know how to not hurt her, but he quickly realizes that he’s got to figure it out because he needs her to breathe. When memories of his mother’s death resurface from where he’s repressed them for so long, Mila is there to catch him when the guilt starts making sense. Mila is the one…the one who can save him from his broken troubled heart; from his issues, from the emptiness. But only if he can stop being an asshole long enough to allow it. He knows that. And he’s working on it. But is that enough to make her stay?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1.jpg","author":"Courtney Cole","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:27 PM"}}
