{"id":84789,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Pax \"Little Red Riding Hood?\" Mila cocks an eyebrow at me, a whisper of a smile flitting across her full lips. I nod. \"For some reason, that\u0027s how I think of you,\" I admit to her. \"You were strolling out on the beach, all alone, and came along just when I needed you.\" My eyes are glued on her face. I know that there is someone else in the room, but to me, it\u0027s just me and Mila. She stares at me uncertainly. \"That would make you the Big Bad Wolf,\" she points out. I laugh. \"Now you\u0027re catching on,\" I tell her. Her gaze remains locked with mine, her eyes clear and dark. My gut wrenches at the sight of her clean and clear expression. There is no drug induced haze in her eyes, a marked difference from my usual companions. It\u0027s both refreshing and terrifying. I\u0027m not sure how to interact with her. But since I woke up this morning craving her company, I knew I had to seek it out. So here I am. \"Is this for me?\" Mila motions toward the shopping bag and I nod. She delves into it with interest and then her face lights up when she sees all of the sweaters. \"They\u0027re all red,\" she laughs. \"Every one of them.\" I feel my lip twitch. \"Of course they are. I have to keep you in character somehow, don\u0027t I? I didn\u0027t know what style you liked, so I bought you a bunch of them. I wanted you to be fully stocked the next time you come along and save me.\" She visibly startles and stares at me, her movements frozen, her fingers dangling limply at her sides. I can\u0027t help but notice her slender hourglass figure. She\u0027s proportioned absolutely right to drive a man crazy. Full tits, tiny waist, lush hips. My groin tightens. Fuck. I quickly think of dead puppies, nuns and cold pork. It seems to do the trick and my dick calms down. For now. Mila is still staring at me, an intense, charged gaze. \"Do you need saving?\" she asks quietly. The air between us practically crackles with energy as we stare each other down. Her eyes are fathomless and deep, the kind of eyes that a man could fall into and lose himself. Permanently. I am flustered for a moment, trying to find the words to answer her when the other person in the room clears her throat. An escape. Thank you, God. I turn gratefully to find another woman there, a pretty blonde woman that I\u0027ve seen before, but I can\u0027t place where. She seems to be waiting for an introduction, but Mila isn\u0027t giving her one. I hold my hand out. \"Hi,\" I tell her. \"I\u0027m Pax Tate.\" She shakes my hand firmly. Perhaps a little too firmly. \"Madison Hill,\" she answers. \"Mila\u0027s sister.\" Oh. Then her stern handshake makes sense. Big sister is looking out for little sister, trying to protect Mila from the Big Bad Wolf. I can\u0027t really blame her. Madison is staring at me now with blue eyes that are nothing like her sister\u0027s. In fact, nothing about her resembles Mila, except for maybe the shape of her nose. She\u0027s tall and blonde, while Mila is petite and dark. Mila is sexier, although for some reason, I\u0027m guessing that she doesn\u0027t think so. She\u0027s quiet now, allowing her sister to do the talking. It is clear that she is used to her sister taking charge. \"So are you feeling better?\" Madison cocks an eyebrow, her question a not-so-subtle way of telling me that she knows that I OD\u0027d the other night. That she thinks I\u0027m a fuck-up who isn\u0027t good enough for her sister. I can see that in her icy blue eyes. The thing that she doesn\u0027t understand, though, is that I don\u0027t give a shit what she thinks. She doesn\u0027t know me and that is my biggest pet peeve- when people judge me without knowing what the fuck they\u0027re talking about. \"I am, thank you,\" I tell her. I smile pleasantly. I won\u0027t bow to her. She\u0027s crazy if she thinks that. \"Your sister was a lifesaver.\" Literally. Madison doesn\u0027t know how to respond. I can see that she wants to say more, but there\u0027s really no way she can without seeming completely rude. She\u0027s disgruntled as she turns and kisses Mila on the cheek. \"I\u0027ve got to get back to The Hill. I\u0027ll see you tomorrow, okay?\" she looks pointedly at her sister, as if to silently warn her away from me. Then she glances at me. \"It was...nice to meet you.\" And then she walks out, her stylish boots clicking on the tiled floor. The bells above the door jingle and then she\u0027s gone. I look at Mila. \"I don\u0027t think your sister likes me much.\" It\u0027s a statement, not a question. And even I can hear the ambivalence in my voice. It\u0027s obvious that I don\u0027t care. Mila actually smiles. \"Well, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re not all broken up about it.\" I shrug. \"I\u0027m used to it.\" Mila studies me quietly. \"Why are you really here?\" she asks. \"I didn\u0027t need for you to bring me a sweater. Or six.\" She chuckles. \"Obviously I\u0027ll be all set in red sweaters for Christmas though. So thank you.\" She pauses and looks at me and her face is very delicate. I hadn\u0027t noticed before how delicate she is. I can\u0027t imagine her trying to pull me out of a car. I must outweigh her by a hundred pounds. \"So?\" She raises an eyebrow and I realize that I haven\u0027t answered her question. I don\u0027t exactly know what to say, so I decide to simply tell the truth. It\u0027s a novel concept for me. \"I couldn\u0027t remember if I thanked you for what you did,\" I tell her. \"And I can\u0027t get you out of my head.\" Her breath freezes on her lips. I can hear the startled little intake of breath and I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s a good thing or not. Did the truth scare her? Or has she been thinking about me too? I look at her. And for a moment, we are suspended in the moment. She drags her bottom lip into her teeth and her green eyes are liquid. She turns her face slightly, the curve of her cheek catching the sunlight from the window. We are frozen. And then she breaks the spell. \"You\u0027ve been thinking about me?\" she whispers. \"Why?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" I tell her honestly. \"Maybe I feel like I owe you.\" \"You don\u0027t,\" she answers quickly, her voice clear and sure. \"You don\u0027t owe me anything. I\u0027m glad I was there to help, but it was purely coincidence and anyone would have done the same. \" Her hands flutter around her nervously as she shuffles paper on the counter. I shake my head and smile. \"Not everyone would have done that,\" I tell her. \"Not at all.\" She\u0027s hesitant now, probably remembering that night and how I had apparently puked all over her. Finally, she smiles too. \"Okay, fine. Not everyone would have given you mouth to mouth. Maybe you do owe me. What are you going to do about it?\" Her sassy words seem to startle her as much as they startle me. She looks surprised as soon as they are out of her mouth. But she\u0027s nowhere near as surprised as I am. Is she flirting? With me? My, what big teeth I have. I once again feel like the wolf as I smile at her, as I turn on my charm. I have it, I just seldom care enough to use it. I\u0027m baffled as to why I\u0027m using it now. But I am. Because her sassiness was an invitation. \"Hmm,\" I answer, grinning my best flirtatious grin. \"What would you like? A pint of blood?\" She laughs, nervous and musical, before she shakes her head. \"No, I gave up drinking blood a long time ago. I developed an allergy.\" Warmth floods through me before I can stop it. She has a sense of humor. I love that in a woman. I grin back. \"Okay, noted. No blood for you. Okay, I\u0027ve got it. Clearly, you\u0027re an artist who likes to feature the lake in your work. I happen to have one of the best views in Angel Bay from my beach. It\u0027s private and quiet and no one will bother you. You can use it whenever you\u0027d like. How about that?\" I don\u0027t know why I just offered that. There is utter silence and I can feel my heart pound as I wait for her to respond. Why do I care what she says? But I wait, holding my breath, until she speaks. \"That\u0027s quite an offer,\" she finally says, her gaze still holding mine. We seem to be doing a lot of staring today. \"Do you live alone? I\u0027d hate to disturb anyone.\" I\u0027m more relieved by her answer than I care to admit. And then I\u0027m amused. She\u0027s fishing. \"You\u0027re very direct,\" I answer, my lip twitching again. \"Most girls try to be more subtle when they ask if I have a girlfriend. But the answer is no. I\u0027m not married. And I don\u0027t have a girlfriend. You won\u0027t be disturbing anyone.\" She blushes now, a faint pink that spreads from her cheeks down to her chest. I like it. It\u0027s seems very soft, very feminine. Once again, I fight the urge to reach out and trace the delicate color with my thumb. What the fuck is wrong with me? I jam my hand into my pocket instead. \"Hmm,\" she answers. \"It seems a shame to waste a view like that on one person. I bet sunrises are amazing there. Something like that should be shared.\" I laugh now, loudly. She completely just walked into this and I\u0027m pretty sure she didn\u0027t mean to. \"You don\u0027t have to beat around the bush about it, Mila. If you want to be there at sunrise, just pack an overnight bag when you come out.\" No one could miss my suggestive tone. And she doesn\u0027t. She blushes again, her cheeks bright red. \"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" she mumbles. She\u0027s embarrassed and I like it. \"No?\" I ask, my eyebrow still cocked. \"Because I can certainly arrange a sleepover.\" \"I\u0027m sure,\" she says wryly. \"But no. Thank you for the invite, though.\" She\u0027s laughing now, her blush fading. \"Truly, thank you for the offer of your beach. I can paint the lake from memory, but it\u0027s always nice to actually be there looking at it. A new view will be great. Artists are visual people.\" The air seems to whoosh out of me for some reason and I don\u0027t even know why. Perhaps it is the thought of her sleeping over. Or maybe it is the sound of her voice. It seems to have a profound effect on me. I step toward her and she looks uncertain, but she doesn\u0027t move away. \"Men are visual too,\" I tell her softly, my eyes frozen on hers. \"So I understand. But there is something that bothers me, something that puts me at a disadvantage. And I really don\u0027t like feeling disadvantaged.\" \"What is it?\" she asks, her eyes not leaving mine. \"You\u0027ve seen me at my worst. Maybe you should see me at my best.\" My words hang between us, heavy and charged, and I don\u0027t know what the fuck I am doing. \"When are you at your best?\" she asks hesitantly. And I can see from the determined look on her face that she is trying hard not to feel intimidated. I\u0027m impressed. She\u0027s like a kitten standing up to a lion. \"In bed.\" My answer is simple. And her eyes shoot sparks in response. \"You\u0027re kind of arrogant, aren\u0027t you?\" she demands, her hands on her slender, paint-spattered hips. \"A simple Thank you for saving my life would suffice. I don\u0027t need for you to carry me off to your bed to show your gratitude.\" I pause for a minute before I try to smooth her ruffled feathers. \"Calm down,\" I tell her quietly. \"I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s a habit. I was just joking. Sometimes I have an inappropriate sense of humor. Thank you for the other night. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t say it before.\" She purses her lips and then sighs. \"It\u0027s okay,\" she answers. \"And you did say it in the hospital. You didn\u0027t need to come here and say it again. I have been wondering though...\" and her voice trails off. It\u0027s her turn to stare at me now and her gaze is contemplative. I stare back unflinching. \"What?\" I prompt. \"What have you been wondering?\" \"Why did you do it?\" she asks softly. \"Why would you do that? It seems like you have a wonderful life.\" I\u0027m surprised again. This girl is very direct and doesn\u0027t hesitate to say what she\u0027s thinking. And she thinks that I purposely tried to kill myself. What the fuck? On the one hand, her direct attitude is refreshing. I have a feeling that she doesn\u0027t play games. But on the other hand, it\u0027s annoying as hell. Because sometimes I like to get lost in games so that I don\u0027t have to provide any real answers. But I have a feeling that Mila doesn\u0027t tolerate bullshit. \"It was an accident,\" I shrug. \"I was being careless. It won\u0027t happen again.\" She\u0027s still staring at me and I fight the urge to flinch. It\u0027s like she\u0027s looking inside of me, trying to pick me apart and examine me. I don\u0027t like it. \"Really?\" she asks. She sounds doubtful, unsure. \"I hope not. If you\u0027re lying, I hope you get help. I might not be there next time to save you.\" She turns on her heel and heads for the back room. And just like that, Mila the artist with the wholesome smile walks out of my life. I\u0027m surprised by how much I don\u0027t like the feeling.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-6.html","bookId":2758,"book":{"id":2758,"title":"If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1)","description":"Storyline: If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1) 24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole. Seriously. He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. But he’s got his reasons.

And it’s never more apparent than when he meets Mila. Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart.
