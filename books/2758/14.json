{"id":84797,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Pax\n I lie awake, staring at Mila\u0027s painting of me. She finished it a couple days after she started it and I had brought it to my house and hung it next to my bed. It\u0027s amazing, but it\u0027s a bit too personal to hang in the living room. Even though it\u0027s an abstract, you can still tell that I\u0027m naked.\n The bronzes and golds of my body are contoured into curved muscles, tightly coiled. My tats are blurs of color, more conceptual than real. My eyes are closed and my head is bowed as though I\u0027m thinking. It\u0027s incredible and I\u0027m touched as hell that she actually finished it for me. Nobody has ever done something like that for me before.\n I study it, wondering what the Painted Me is thinking.\n The Real Me is thinking that I\u0027m fucking hungry.\n I swing my legs out of bed and make my way to the kitchen to grab a slice of cold pizza for breakfast. Mila and I had ordered it last night after our third \"official\" date. This time, we had watched a movie here at my place, and this time, the movie was my choice. It was no chick flick. It was completely made up of gunfire and gore. A man\u0027s movie. Mila watched it like a trooper, thumping her chest and pretending to scratch her imaginary balls.\n I am chuckling at the memory when my phone rings. My mouth is full of pizza, but I answer it anyway because I see Mila\u0027s name.\n \"Hey,\" she says and she sounds a bit breathless. I immediately imagine her breathing like that into my ear with her legs wrapped around my hips. And just like that, I\u0027m hard as hell.\n \"Hey,\" I answer, adjusting my erection. \"Good morning.\"\n I smile into the phone because I can\u0027t help it. This girl makes me smile like an idiot.\n \"I was just calling to remind you of the therapist appointment this morning,\" she tells me. \"I figured you\u0027d forget. Or change your mind.\"\n Pause.\n Fuck.\n She\u0027s right. I don\u0027t want to go. But I\u0027m willing to go for two reasons. One) I want to stop dreaming about my mother because it\u0027s freaking me the fuck out. And two) I think it will help put Mila at ease. I know she\u0027s struggling with the idea of dating me. She thinks I\u0027m going to stomp on her heart. To be completely honest, I\u0027m afraid I accidentally will. So off to therapy I go. I can do this. I\u0027m no pussy.\n \"Whatever,\" I tell her, rolling my eyes. \"Oh, ye of little faith. I haven\u0027t forgotten. I\u0027m all showered and everything.\"\n She laughs.\n \"Oh, really? You mean you aren\u0027t standing at the windows with bedhead and in your underwear? And eating a slice of pizza?\"\n Startled, I look down and find Mila standing in my driveway. She holds up a white paper bag and grins.\n \"I brought you doughnuts,\" she says into the phone. \"Come answer your door.\"\n I shake my head, but honestly, I\u0027m happy she\u0027s here. Fucking ecstatic, actually. I had been disappointed when she didn\u0027t want to sleep over last night, curled up on my couch with me. She was afraid that she couldn\u0027t trust herself not to move too fast.\n This might make me a pussy, but she\u0027s been the first thing I\u0027ve thought of every morning this week when I woke up. And she\u0027s the last thing I think about when I go to sleep. Not that I\u0027d ever admit that to anyone.\n I try not to break my neck as I hurry to the door and open it. Before Mila can even say a word, I grab her and kiss her hard, smashing her against my chest. I hear the crinkle of a paper bag as we smash it between us. Her arms come up and wrap around me, pulling me closer. She smells like flowers and vanilla. And winter.\n \"I missed you,\" she murmurs against my neck. She\u0027s cold from the outdoors and I pull her inside.\n \"You just saw me last night,\" I remind her as I nibble at her lip. She smiles against me and I add, \"But I missed you too.\"\n I really did.\n And that scares the shit out of me.\n But of course I don\u0027t say that. Instead, I just pull her into my kitchen where we eat smashed doughnuts, perched atop breakfast bar stools.\n Mila eyes hers. \"I guess it still tastes the same,\" she shrugs. \"Even though you flattened it.\"\n She raises an eyebrow and takes a huge bite of her chocolate drizzled roll. She licks her finger, which causes my gut to clench.\n \"What time was my appointment?\" I ask, looking away from her tongue and glancing at the clock.\n \"It\u0027s in thirty minutes,\" she tells me. \"Dr. Nate Tyler. He\u0027s in town. I texted you the address.\"\n I nod. \"I\u0027ve still got it. Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m going to jump in the shower and then I\u0027m out of here.\"\n She stares at me. \"I really just wanted to tell you good luck. And that I\u0027m proud of you for doing this. I know you don\u0027t like to talk about personal stuff.\"\n \"You got that right, sister,\" I mutter as I swing around on my stool. I drop a kiss on her cheek. \"I\u0027ve got to get moving if I don\u0027t want to be late. Want to join me?\"\n She grins wickedly. \"I would. If we were two months further into our relationship.\" She shrugs. \"But as it is... no.\"\n I raise an eyebrow. \"So you can paint naked in front of me, but you can\u0027t shower with me?\"\n She slugs me lightly on the arm, rolling her eyes. \"Now you\u0027re getting it.\"\n I smile. \"Good. I\u0027m just trying to get all of these dating rules down. It\u0027s sort of complicated. Confusing, really.\"\n Mila grins, wide and beatific. \"It\u0027s not that hard. I still like to look, even if I\u0027m not ready to touch yet. But good things come to those who wait, mister.\"\n I shake my head and start off for my bedroom. \"I hope so,\" I call over my shoulder. \"My hand\u0027s getting tired.\"\n I can still hear her laughing as I step into the shower and let the water beat down on me. I was only partially joking. My hand is getting tired. But that doesn\u0027t stop me from using it.\n \"Tell me about your drug use,\" Dr. Tyler instructs me. He is using the calm monotone that I always think of psychiatrists using. The one that says, If I talk slowly and quietly enough, I\u0027ll keep the psychos at bay.\n I shift my weight from one hip to the other in an ugly-as-fuck blue plaid chair. The doctor is older, graying at his temples and he\u0027s wearing reading glasses even though he isn\u0027t reading. I sigh. I really don\u0027t want to be here. I feel like a bug under a microscope and the dark paneling of this doctor\u0027s study seems to be closing in on me.\n \"My drug use isn\u0027t the problem,\" I tell him. \"The dreams that I\u0027ve been having are my problem. They\u0027re fucked up. I\u0027m sorry,\" I quickly correct. \"They\u0027re messed up.\"\n Dr. Tyler smiles a bit as he makes some sort of note on his notepad.\n \"Why do you think your dreams are messed up?\" he probes, his dark eyes assessing me. \"Have you ever dreamt them before?\"\n I shake my head. \"They\u0027re about my mother. And I haven\u0027t dreamed about her since I was small. As an adult, I make a conscious effort to not think of her. I\u0027ll admit it, I try to avoid painful things.\"\n The doctor nods as he takes notes. \"That\u0027s not unusual,\" he tells me. \"Avoidance is human nature. But tell me more about these dreams.\"\n So I do. I tell him how my mother is pleading. And how I am scared but I can\u0027t see and how my mother has turned into Mila in them.\n The doctor studies me yet again. \"It sounds like you are somehow associating Mila with your mother. Was your mother like Mila in some way?\"\n I think on that. And even though it\u0027s been a very long time since I\u0027ve seen it, I can still remember my mother\u0027s smile.\n \"My mother had a pretty smile,\" I tell him. \"It was very warm, like Mila\u0027s. Maybe that\u0027s it.\"\n The doctor scribbles. \"Anything else?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I muse. \"Mila seems soft and graceful. I think my mother was the same way. My mother was actually a ballet dancer, before she retired when I was born. Mila is an artist...so they are both artistic types.\"\n More scribbling.\n \"Was your mother very accepting of you? She loved you unconditionally?\"\n I stare at him. \"I was only seven when she died. But I\u0027m guessing that, yes, that was the case.\"\n \"Is Mila very accepting of you?\" Dr. Tyler asks quietly, his pen paused above his pad. I stare back at him. He might have hit upon something.\n \"Yes,\" I tell him. \"For whatever reason, she\u0027s been very patient with me.\"\n \"Just like your mother,\" the doctor says pointedly.\n \"Yes.\" I agree, my heart pounding for a reason that I don\u0027t understand. My hands are sweaty, too. I wipe them on my jeans.\n \"Tell me about the drug use,\" Dr. Tyler says now, without looking up. I sigh again.\n \"You\u0027re not going to give up on that drug use thing, are you?\"\n He smiles and shakes his head.\n \"People use drugs for many different reasons,\" Dr. Tyler says. \"I\u0027d like to uncover yours.\"\n I try to hide my annoyance. I want to get to the root of my current issue, not dig into something useless. But I do my best to humor him.\n \"I started taking sleeping pills when I was little, after my mother died. My therapist prescribed them because I couldn\u0027t sleep without nightmares. As the years went on, I realized that I liked the way I could take them and slip away from reality. I starting using different kinds of drugs. I\u0027ve never stopped, until recently.\"\n Dr. Tyler stops scribbling and looks up.\n \"You\u0027ve stopped using? Why?\"\n I nod. \"I dumped everything out this past week. I don\u0027t want to feel numb right now. Like I keep telling everyone, I\u0027m not an addict. This isn\u0027t a big deal.\"\n He lays his pen down and studies me. \"You don\u0027t consider drug use a big deal?\"\n I exhale and fiddle with my hands. \"Of course it isn\u0027t legal and it isn\u0027t healthy. But what I meant is that I\u0027ve never been addicted. I\u0027ve barely craved anything since I dumped everything down the drain.\"\n The doctor nods. \"Some people do have more addictive personalities than others. It must be harder for you to become physically addicted to narcotics than others. That\u0027s in your favor. But I\u0027d like to talk about why you\u0027ve done drugs for so long if you haven\u0027t been addicted. You\u0027ve just told me that you know it isn\u0027t healthy. So why would you inflict that kind of thing on your body if you could\u0027ve stopped at any time?\"\n I stare at the floor, at my feet, at the patterned rug.\n \"I don\u0027t know. Because I craved oblivion, I guess. Because it\u0027s easier to fade out of reality than face it. My reality as a kid wasn\u0027t that great. My mother was dead and my father might as well have been, because he sure as hell checked out when my mother died.\"\n The doctor nods. \"It sounds like you\u0027re a little angry about the way he handled things.\"\n I think about that. \"Yes. I\u0027m angry about it. He had a little kid to raise and not only did he pretty much neglect me and spend every waking hour at work, but he uprooted me and moved me across the country to live in a place where I didn\u0027t know anyone. He couldn\u0027t have made a worse choice. I needed normalcy, I needed to be around people that knew and loved me. But instead, I got nothing.\"\n \"So, you took drugs to cope?\"\n \"I guess,\" I answer. \"Although that makes it sound like a cop-out.\"\n Dr. Tyler looks up. \"It\u0027s not a cop out. Everyone has their reasons. Is that yours?\"\n \"I suppose,\" I admit, and the feeling of admitting it is huge. I don\u0027t know why. But there is something freeing about saying it out loud. \"I took drugs to cope with the void that I feel.\"\n Does that make me a pussy, after all?\n Dr. Tyler looks interested. \"Did it help? Did it fill the void?\"\n I stare at my hands. \"Yes.\"\n \"When the drugs wore off, did the void come back?\"\n \"Yes,\" I answer quietly.\n \"Is the void still there?\" The doctor is definitely interested now, his dark eyes staring into mine. I look away, at the wall, at the clock.\n \"Yes,\" I answer honestly.\n It\u0027s quiet now, the only noise coming from Dr. Tyler\u0027s pen scratching across the page. I have the urge to reach over and grab it, to snap it into two. But I obviously don\u0027t. That would be crazy and I have no reason. I don\u0027t know where my sudden anger is coming from. I flex my fingers against my knee.\n \"You don\u0027t like talking to me, do you?\" Dr. Tyler observes without lifting up his head.\n \"No, I don\u0027t.\"\n \"Then why are you here?\"\n I think about that, trying to come up with a somewhat polite answer.\n \"Because Mila asked me. And because I\u0027m tired of the messed up dreams.\"\n The doctor looks at me, his eyes kind. \"What exactly bothers you the most about the dreams? It must be something substantial to get you to come see me.\"\n My foot bounces up and down with nervous energy.\n \"I don\u0027t know. I think it\u0027s because my mom seems to want something and I\u0027m not able to give it to her and it seems important. And because she turns into Mila and that freaks me out.\"\n The doctor smiles. \"I wouldn\u0027t worry about that aspect. Many people associate others in their dreams and it doesn\u0027t mean anything significant, at least regarding that person. Most of the time, it\u0027s symbolic of something else entirely. If I had to guess and at this point, it\u0027s an early guess, but if I had to guess, I would say that your mother turns into Mila because you have a deep-seeded fear that Mila is going to leave you like your mother did.\"\n Shock slams into me and I suck in my breath. It\u0027s quite a concept and one that I hadn\u0027t thought of.\n \"My mother didn\u0027t leave me,\" I manage to answer. \"She died. There\u0027s a difference.\"\n \"Yes, there is. But to a seven-year old boy who has been uprooted from everything he knows, there\u0027s not much difference. And it was at that point, when you were seven, that that idea was formed. In your head, she left you. And it was perfectly normal to feel angry about that. It\u0027s one of the normal phases of grief, actually. But since you blocked it out and didn\u0027t deal with it, you\u0027ve never successfully gone through those stages. You might be stuck in the anger phase.\"\n \"Fuck,\" I breathe.\n \"Indeed,\" the doctor answers. \"You\u0027ve got some work ahead of you.\"\n He scribbles some more and I pull at my collar as the room seems to get hotter and hotter. Then thankfully, my hour is over.\n On the way out, the doctor scribbles something on a little paper and hands it to me.\n \"It\u0027s for Xanax,\" he says. \"If you get the urge to use something again, to block out the stress or anger, get this filled instead.\"\n I give him a hard look.\n \"I told you. I don\u0027t need this.\" I start to hand it back, but he holds up his hand.\n \"Take it,\" he urges me. \"Just in case.\"\n I roll my eyes.\n \"Whatever.\" I crumple it as I shove it into my pocket. \"See you next week.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-14.html","bookId":2758,"book":{"id":2758,"title":"If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1)","description":"Storyline: \n If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1) \n 24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole. \n Seriously. \n He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. \n But he’s got his reasons. \n His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why.
