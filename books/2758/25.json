As if that will happen. My heart constricts at the memory of what Pax has been through.\\n\\n Ever since he walked away from me last week, ever since I watched the rejection ripple over his face, the hurt and angst, I have played that moment over and over in my mind. Regretting it, beating myself up over it. But there\u0027s nothing else I could have done.\\n\\n He has to know that every action has a consequence. And even though he says he will change, that he realizes he needs to change, I\u0027m pretty sure he needs a reason to actually change. If I take him back like he didn\u0027t hurt me, he won\u0027t have a very good reason.\\n\\n Except for the one where his entire life has imploded around him, you idiot, I tell myself. Pax has every reason in the world to change, reasons that don\u0027t even include me. If only he is strong enough to see it.\\n\\n Against my better judgment, I reach for my phone. It has been a week since I have seen him or spoken with him. My heart just wants to hear from him, to know that he\u0027s okay. Maybe then I can sleep.\\n\\n I\u0027m thinking about you. I hope you\u0027re okay.\\n\\n I send the text and wait with the phone in my fingers. There is no answer. Although I probably deserve that.\\n\\n I waver back and forth in my conviction. Maddy agrees that I had no other choice but to send him away when he came to my shop. But part of me, an increasingly more insistent part, doubts it. I love him. I love him more than anything. And isn\u0027t part of love standing next to him through thick and thin?\\n\\n Love never fails. I gulp.\\n\\n But then again, sometimes love has to put boxing gloves on and be tough in order to survive. Sometimes, you have to do the harder thing - the thing where you let someone grow on their own.\\n\\n I fall asleep with tears on my cheek and my phone in my hands. When I wake up, there is a text waiting for me.\\n\\n I\u0027m thinking about you, too. And I\u0027m getting there.\\n\\n His words make my heart smile. And it is somehow easier to get up and face my day.\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027re losing weight,\" Maddy announces, as she prances through my shop in her new boots and a take-out sack.\\n\\n I look up from where I am framing a print of the night sky and roll my eyes.\\n\\n \"First, I thought you said we had to tighten our belts this winter?\" I ask with my eyebrow raised as I stare pointedly at her boots.\\n\\n She looks sheepish. \"That was true. But things are perking up now that spring is rolling around.\"\\n\\n \"February isn\u0027t spring,\" I tell her wryly. She rolls her eyes.\\n\\n \"A mere technicality. It\u0027s late February. Almost spring. Now that people aren\u0027t snowed in, business is picking up. But you\u0027re deflecting. You haven\u0027t been eating right. I bet you\u0027ve lost ten pounds - and you didn\u0027t have it to lose, Slim.\"\\n\\n I would say something, but I wouldn\u0027t have a leg to stand on. She\u0027s right. I\u0027ve lost weight and I didn\u0027t have it to lose.\\n\\n \"Did you bring me something to eat?\" I ask instead. She nods, plunking the sack unceremoniously down on my picture.\\n\\n \"Grilled cheese and a bowl of minestrone. Tony said to eat it all and you\u0027ll get dessert. He also said you\u0027re getting chicken legs.\"\\n\\n I shake my head, and can\u0027t help but smile. Tony loves us in his own gruff way. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it was his idea that Maddy brought me the food.\\n\\n \"I saw Pax\u0027s car parked in front of Dr. Tyler\u0027s office,\" Maddy mentions as she curls herself into a sleek red chair. \"He\u0027s been there a lot lately. Have you talked to him?\"\\n\\n I chew a bite of my sandwich and swallow hard to get it to go down. \"No. Not in a month. Has he been in to The Hill?\"\\n\\n Maddy shakes her head. \"No. And I haven\u0027t seen his car at the bar, either. He\u0027s pretty much been out of sight, except for when he\u0027s with Dr. Tyler.\"\\n\\n She stares at me.\\n\\n I ignore it.\\n\\n \"Well?\" she finally demands, her ice blue gaze on mine. \"He\u0027s respecting your space and he\u0027s putting in the effort so that he can move forward. Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s time that you took the initiative to speak with him?\"\\n\\n I almost drop my sandwich. \"Who are you and what have you done with my sister?\" I demand. \"You don\u0027t like Pax. You\u0027ve never liked Pax. You\u0027ve told me a hundred times that he\u0027s not worth my time, that he\u0027ll never be boyfriend material.\"\\n\\n I am beyond shocked at her.\\n\\n Maddy has the grace to look sheepish.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she admits. \"I can\u0027t explain why I feel differently. I just do. My gut instincts are telling me that he deserves a second chance. I really think he\u0027s trying, Mi. To be honest, not only have I not seen his car at the bar, but when I was in there the other day for a drink, I asked Mickey if he\u0027s seen him. He hasn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n She stares at me again, hard and long. I sigh.\\n\\n \"Madison, just because he hasn\u0027t been in the Bear\u0027s Den doesn\u0027t mean that he\u0027s stopped drinking. Or doing worse things. For all we know, he\u0027s holed up in his house with whiskey and drugs. We don\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing.\"\\n\\n There is a pause while Madison fidgets.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing,\" she finally says hesitantly. \"Because you haven\u0027t talked with him. But I have.\"\\n\\n I do drop my sandwich this time, right into my soup.\\n\\n \"What?\" I ask, as my stomach plummets into my feet. \"You lied? You said you haven\u0027t spoken with him.\"\\n\\n For some strange reason, my fingers shake as I wait for her answer, as my heart beats loudly against my ribcage.\\n\\n Madison looks uncertain now. \"I didn\u0027t lie. I said he hasn\u0027t been in The Hill. And he hasn\u0027t. But he called me a couple of weeks ago. Apparently, he\u0027s been keeping an eye on you and he noticed that you\u0027ve still been picking up a lot of shifts for me and he wanted to help.\"\\n\\n \"He. What?\" I ask stiltedly, trying to wrap my mind around this new turn of events. My icy sister has been speaking to Pax behind my back?\\n\\n \"He wanted to help,\" she repeats. \"He told me that he knows how much The Hill means to us since it was our parents\u0027 dream and he wanted to make sure that we don\u0027t lose it. He paid off our renovation loan and then he sent one of his own business advisors to talk to me. We sat down and wrote out an updated business plan and now The Hill is back on track. It appears that I needed to make a few changes and so I did. And also, apparently, I needed to make a few changes in my personal life, too, like not judging someone that I don\u0027t even know. I didn\u0027t know Pax. I had no right to tell you stay away from him.\"\\n\\n I am stunned beyond words. I feel like something is sitting on my chest, weighing down my lungs as I stare at my sister. I can\u0027t breathe.\\n\\n I grab my water and take a drink, then another.\\n\\n \"Pax did that?\" I finally manage to croak. Maddy nods.\\n\\n \"But I was sworn to secrecy. He doesn\u0027t want you to know what he did. He was very adamant that when you finally give him another chance, it will be because he earned it on his own merit, not because of this.\"\\n\\n \"Do you know how he\u0027s doing?\" I whisper. \"Is he okay?\"\\n\\n Madison nods. \"I went to his house to meet with his business advisor. He and I chatted for a while. His main concern was you. He wanted to make sure that you\u0027re okay. He feels like such an ass for hurting you and he\u0027s afraid he\u0027s never going to redeem himself for that. But otherwise, he\u0027s okay. He looks healthy and he\u0027s been seeing Dr. Tyler two times a week. He even said that he and his dad are working things out. I think those are huge strides, Mi.\"\\n\\n And they are. She really has no idea. She wasn\u0027t there to see the look on Pax\u0027s face when he found out that his dad had hidden everything for years. The gut-wrenching betrayal that lived in his eyes. I really wasn\u0027t sure that he\u0027d ever be able to forgive his father.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m supposed to do,\" I finally admit to her in a whisper, collapsing onto the chair with my sister. She wraps a slender arm around me.\\n\\n \"Do you love him?\" she asks, staring into my eyes. Without hesitation, I nod.\\n\\n \"Is he worth the heartache and the effort?\"\\n\\n Her face is grave and somber as she brushes the hair out of my eyes.\\n\\n I nod again.\\n\\n \"Pax is worth anything.\"\\n\\n Madison smiles. \"I thought you would say that. My advice to you then, little sister, is that you go talk to him. He\u0027s trying very hard. I admire that. I have to respect it. And I know he loves you.\"\\n\\n I am frozen. Utterly frozen. I can practically feel my heart beating in my ears.\\n\\n \"What are you waiting for?\" Maddy asks me gently, pushing at my shoulder. \"Go.\"\\n\\n So I do.\\n\\n The drive to Pax\u0027s house has never taken so long before. But even still, I sit in my car for a couple of minutes after I pull into his drive. Danger is parked in front of me, so I know he is home. I am filled with both breathless anticipation and utter anxiety as I slosh through the muddy snow to his door.\\n\\n What if he doesn\u0027t want me anymore? What if I took too long to get to this point? What if it\u0027s too late?\\n\\n I take a few deep breaths as I stand on Pax\u0027s front porch.\\n\\n Deep breath in, deep breath out.\\n\\n Repeat.\\n\\n I ring the doorbell, then knock. I am suddenly overwhelmed by the need to see his face, to see him healthy and strong. I want to see his eyes without pain in them. My stomach clenches again and again as I wait. It seems to take forever and when the door finally opens, I am breathless.\\n\\n For the first time in a month, Pax is standing in front of me, filling up the doorframe.\\n\\n He is so beautiful in jeans and a black shirt. No one can carry off casual like he can.\\n\\n My knees feel weak.\\n\\n His eyes widen when he sees me, but then he smoothes his expression out. He\u0027s casual now, friendly. But cautious. Clearly cautious.\\n\\n \"Hi, Red,\" he says quietly, watching my face. Waiting for me to say something. I am the one who came to see him, after all. I swallow. I have to restrain myself from vaulting into his arms.\\n\\n \"Hi.\"\\n\\n Oh my god. I want to say a thousand things and all I say is hi? I\u0027m a lunatic.\\n\\n \"Can I come in?\" I quickly add. Pax smiles and gestures with his arm.\\n\\n \"Of course. Anytime. You know that. Can I get you something to drink? A water, maybe?\"\\n\\n Why is he being so formal? My heart twinges a bit. Did I wait too long? Has he moved on?\\n\\n The thought practically paralyzes me, but I still manage to decline the water and follow him into his living room. I glance around as I sit. He hasn\u0027t changed his house any. It is still light and airy, a modern loft, perfectly neat and clean. A part of me deep down is relieved. If he hasn\u0027t changed his house, maybe he hasn\u0027t changed his feelings for me.\\n\\n Even I know that thought is irrational as hell. But I think I\u0027m grasping at straws.\\n\\n \"How are you?\" I ask, staring at him. \"Are you okay?\"\\n\\n He thrums his long fingers against his denim-clad thigh. He\u0027s still working out. That much is apparent. I can see the hard muscle through the fabric. I gulp.\\n\\n He smiles. \"I\u0027m doing really well. I won\u0027t lie, though. It\u0027s been hard as hell to wrap my mind around everything. But it\u0027s given me perspective. And this past month, I\u0027ve sort of isolated myself and just focused on things I need to change. I wanted to make sure that I gave you a reason to want to be with me.\"\\n\\n He pauses.\\n\\n And my heart pauses as he looks at me. His golden eyes are so warm and vibrant. How had I ever thought they were cold?\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve done a lot of thinking, Mila. And you were right to turn me away a month ago. You really were. I\u0027ve spent a lot of time worrying that I\u0027d completely fucked up with you, that you\u0027d never forgive me. Or that I\u0027d hurt you so badly that you\u0027d never want to look at me again.\"\\n\\n I start to interrupt, but he holds up his hand. \"Please. Just let me finish. I\u0027ve thought about what I would say to you a hundred times. I\u0027m so happy to have the chance to say it.\"\\n\\n I close my mouth and nod. He smiles gently.\\n\\n \"Mila, I\u0027ve said this before, but you are the most beautiful thing I\u0027ve ever seen. You are beautiful inside and out. I don\u0027t deserve to have met you. I don\u0027t deserve you in any way. But there\u0027s nothing I want more than to be with you. To wake up beside you for the rest of my life. I am so grateful that you stuck by me for as long as you did. And all I want to know now is what I can do to make you stick with me again? You name it and I\u0027ll do it. Anything.\"\\n\\n He waits, his eyes glued to mine and I feel overwhelmed by emotion, completely choked up.\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t waited too long?\" I finally manage to say. Pax looks surprised.\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" he asks bewilderedly. \"Of course not. I said I would wait forever for you. I meant it.\"\\n\\n Tears are streaming down my cheeks as I launch myself into his arms. We fold into each other and I bury myself against his chest. He smells the same, like the outdoors and the fresh air. I inhale him and then he tilts my chin up, his lips meeting mine.\\n\\n As I lose myself in his kiss, I know that I never want to be anywhere but here, wrapped in Pax\u0027s arms.\\n\\n It\u0027s where I belong. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-25.html","bookId":2758,"book":{"id":2758,"title":"If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1)","description":"Storyline: If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1) \\n 24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole. \\n Seriously. \\n He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. \\n But he’s got his reasons. \\n His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why.
