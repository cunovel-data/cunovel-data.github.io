That would take a toll on anyone.\"\n He pauses and looks at me. I\u0027ve already been here for thirty minutes and to be honest, I don\u0027t know why I came. Except that I don\u0027t know what to do with everything that is happening in my life. I feel a little like I\u0027m floundering, like I\u0027ve lost control. That was one thing about using. It always made me feel as though I was in control...even when I wasn\u0027t.\n \"Of course it was horrible,\" I answer. \"There was a dead person at my house. It was startling.\"\n Dr. Tyler stares at me. \"There was a dead person at your house whom you have been sexually involved with. She tried to contact you prior to dying. You have more than a passing interest in this, Pax. You need to deal with whatever you are feeling about it. Can you tell me what you feel?\"\n \"I\u0027m pissed, actually,\" I glare at him. \"Why did she have to come to my house to overdose? Was it to prove a point? I told her that we were done, not that there was ever a we. We fulfilled a purpose for each other. That\u0027s all. I didn\u0027t even know her last name.\"\n Dr. Tyler stares at me thoughtfully and I feel like he is trying to look inside of me.\n \"Are you really angry because she died at your house?\" he finally answers. \"Or are you angry that you weren\u0027t there with her? Or for her when she tried to ask you for help? Do you know what her texts said? Or did you throw your phone overboard before you read them?\"\n I\u0027m pissed now, mainly because he\u0027s right. I\u0027ve wondered about those very things.\n \"Are you trying to imply that this is my fault because I didn\u0027t answer her texts? The girl was psycho. She was an addict who needed help. I told her to get help, but she chose not to.\"\n The doctor holds his hand up.\n \"Of course I\u0027m not saying it was your fault,\" he says soothingly. \"It wasn\u0027t. She is responsible for her own actions. I was just wondering if you were able to read any of her messages to you? It might provide you with some sort of explanation, so that you are able to get closure. I\u0027m guessing that you are feeling some guilt and maybe even the urge to use. I want to help you deal with that.\"\n I shake my head.\n \"I don\u0027t need closure. Someone that I know died. I didn\u0027t love her. I read a couple of her messages. She wanted drugs and she sounded desperate. I have no idea where she found the drugs that she overdosed with. The only guilt that I feel is based on the fact that I didn\u0027t cut her off a long time ago. I contributed to her state of mind by giving her drugs for the past two years. That\u0027s something that I am responsible for. I feel badly for her that she wasn\u0027t able to quit, but that\u0027s all. And I haven\u0027t felt the urge to use. Far from it, actually. I\u0027m tired of talking about this now. Can we get back to my issues?\"\n \"In a moment,\" Dr. Tyler answers. \"I\u0027m curious about Mila. How has this affected her?\"\n I pause and I feel my heart quicken. Every day this week since the incident, as I\u0027ve been referring to it, I\u0027ve felt panicky when I pictured the look on Mila\u0027s face that morning. It was a look like she somehow thought it was all my fault, like I might end up like Jill. And like she wasn\u0027t prepared for any of it.\n I swallow and my throat is so dry I can hear it.\n \"Mila is a trooper,\" I reply. \"She stayed while the police asked their questions and she was worried about Jill\u0027s kids. She\u0027s got a soft heart.\"\n \"So, she didn\u0027t draw any parallels between you and Jill?\" The doctor sounds doubtful. I get the sudden urge to punch him in the face.\n \"Of course she did. She told me that it could\u0027ve been me. And then I promised her that it never would be.\"\n \"And did she accept that answer?\" Dr. Tyler\u0027s pen pauses.\n I pause, too.\n \"I don\u0027t know. She seemed to. But she\u0027s been quiet this week, reserved. I don\u0027t know if she is processing it or what.\"\n \"Does it scare you that she might not be able to return to where you were before this happened?\"\n More than anything in the world.\n But I don\u0027t say that.\n Instead, I simply say, \"Yes.\"\n The doctor looks at his paper and scribbles. Someday, I\u0027d like to see exactly what he is writing.\n \"I\u0027d like to change the subject now,\" I tell him firmly. I\u0027m done talking about Mila.\n I steel my gaze and stare at the doctor. He sighs and nods.\n \"Okay. Let\u0027s change the subject. Have you had any more dreams?\n I nod. \"Yes. Several times this week. They are still the same. I\u0027m in a dark room and I can\u0027t see very well. But I can hear my mom. It sounds like she\u0027s pleading with me. I can\u0027t seem to get past that point in the dream. It\u0027s frustrating, because I feel like there is more to see.\"\n The doctor studies me, his fingers rolling his pen around on his lap.\n \"Sometimes, a person\u0027s mind protects itself as best it can. It does that by building barriers and suppressing memories. If I had to guess, I would say that this dream is a memory. And your mind doesn\u0027t want you to remember the rest of it because it will be very painful.\"\n I stare at him. \"You think that I\u0027m dreaming something that really happened?\"\n He nods. \"I\u0027m guessing that is true. I could be wrong. But the only way to find out, is to let your dream play out.\"\n I shake my head, frustrated. \"It won\u0027t. It only goes up to that point, where I\u0027m in a dark place and I can hear my mother. And then I wake up. Usually in a cold sweat.\"\n The doctor nods. \"There is another way, if you\u0027re open to it.\"\n I wait, not sure if I want to know.\n \"Have you ever been hypnotized?\" the doctor asks and I scoff.\n \"Fuck no. No. I\u0027m not getting hypnotized. What kind of quack practice are you running?\"\n I start to stand up, but the doctor holds up his hand.\n \"Wait, Pax. Hypno-therapy is a very valid and useful tool available to us. It isn\u0027t quackery. It\u0027s simply guided relaxation techniques that allow the patient to focus intensely on something, blocking everything else out. Most psychiatrists are trained at using it and in fact, it is a specialty of mine. If you really want to know what you are dreaming about, it is the best way to find out. It strips away the barriers that your mind has put in place, allowing you to see what you are trying to hide from yourself.\"\n Fuck.\n He just had to phrase it that way, didn\u0027t he? Because he has to know that I\u0027m dying to know what my mind is trying to hide.\n I settle back into my seat.\n \"How long will it take?\" I ask uncertainly.\n \"It\u0027s not that time consuming,\" he reassures me. \"And I think it might be good for you.\"\n He stares at me, waiting. Finally, I sigh.\n \"Fine,\" I mutter. \"I\u0027ll do it. But you\u0027d better not trick me into barking like a dog or anything. I don\u0027t want to do it today, but I\u0027ll do it soon.\"\n Dr. Tyler smiles. \"That only happens in movies,\" he tells me. \"And we can do it anytime you\u0027d like. I\u0027ll plan on it for next time, unless you tell me otherwise.\"\n He scribbles a bit more in his notepad.\n \"Have you filled the Xanax prescription?\" he asks, glancing up at me.\n I shake my head. \"No. I told you I didn\u0027t need it.\"\n \"Good for you,\" the doctor commends me. \"You have strong fortitude. It\u0027s encouraging. It seems you really do want to change things around for the better.\"\n I nod and for the first time today, I feel good about something that I\u0027ve done. The quack doctor is right. I really am changing things around for the better. I might be going about it wrong, but at least I\u0027m going about it.\n Mila\n It\u0027s funny how days blend into each other when you aren\u0027t paying attention.\n It\u0027s been weeks since Jill died. Weeks since the misgivings and doubts crept in. Weeks that Pax has given me nothing at all to doubt him for. He\u0027s been perfect. Amazingly, unbelievably perfect. So perfect, in fact, that I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. And so far, it hasn\u0027t.\n I pull into my parents\u0027 driveway, or I guess I should say Madison\u0027s, since she lives here now. But to be honest, this will always be my parents\u0027 house. I think Madison actually feels the same way and I wouldn\u0027t blame her if she wanted to sell it at some point and get a new house of her own.\n I yank the keys out of the ignition and make my way up the icy sidewalk to the door. Maddy opens the door before I even get a chance to knock.\n \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here,\" she tells me, without even saying hello. \"Try this.\"\n She shoves a hot mug into my hand and I sniff it as I step into the house, knocking the snow from my boots on the doorsill.\n \"Hot chocolate?\"\n She nods. \"The best hot chocolate you\u0027ve ever had,\" she says confidently. \"Thick Italian hot chocolate. I\u0027m trying it out for the restaurant. It\u0027s literally so thick the spoon will stand up in it.\"\n I sip at it and the thick, creamy chocolate slides down my throat like pudding.\n \"Holy cow, that\u0027s good,\" I tell her. \"You\u0027ve got a winner.\"\n She tries to grab it back, but I yank it away. \"Not on your life.\"\n She rolls her eyes. \"Fine. Now what was it that you wanted to look for today? I forget.\"\n I take my coat off. \"I just wanted to browse through mom\u0027s memento drawer. I\u0027m feeling a bit sentimental and I miss them. So I thought I\u0027d look through her trinkets.\"\n Madison looks at me sympathetically. \"I know how you feel. I was like that last week. I miss them so much.\"\n Her eyes turn watery, but she moves away, toward the kitchen. Madison isn\u0027t much of a crier. She waves her hand. \"You know where to find it. I\u0027ll be in the kitchen.\"\n She leaves me alone and I pad down the hall to our parent\u0027s bedroom. Even though it\u0027s the master bedroom, Maddy couldn\u0027t bring herself to clean it out and sleep in there. She\u0027s kept her old bedroom, keeping mom and dad\u0027s exactly as it was.\n As I walk in, it is so quiet that it seems almost reverent. If I close my eyes, I try to pretend that I can smell my mom\u0027s perfume lingering here. But of course I can\u0027t. They died several years ago. Her scent is long gone.\n But her memories aren\u0027t.\n I slide open the top drawer of her dresser and pull it out, carrying it to the bed. As I sit on the flowered bedspread, I can remember so many afternoons after school spent in here with her, sitting on the bed as she readied for work at The Hill. She\u0027d sit at her vanity and curl her hair, spritz on perfume and talk with me about my day.\n God, I miss her.\n I sift through the pictures in her drawer first. They are in informal stacks, held together with old rubber-bands. Black and white ones from her youth, faded ones from mine. My favorite picture is here, the one of my dad and I both holding up huge fish that we\u0027d caught in Lake Michigan on one perfect summer day. I was eight years old and had a chocolate mustache and he\u0027s wearing his floppy fishing hat.\n I smile at the memory.\n That was a really good day. Mom and Maddy had sat on the beach because they were squeamish about the fish and bait. Dad had slugged me on the shoulder and we had fished for hours. I had felt so important because I had a strong-stomach and could be his companion.\n I put it back in the pile and replace the worn rubber band.\n I finger through old love letters from my father to her, and even old letters from my grandmother. My mother kept everything and was a sentimental at heart. At times like this, I\u0027m so thankful for that.\n As I move the drawer, I hear a rolling sound. I feel around and find a ring in the corner. It\u0027s a wide band made from rose-colored gold and on the inside, Love Never Fails is inscribed. My chest tightens. I remember this ring. It was mom\u0027s original wedding ring. She had to stop wearing it after she had Maddy because it became too small. And then Daddy had gotten her a fancy diamond and she started wearing that instead.\n But now, holding this simple ring in my hand, I feel buoyed somehow. Love never fails. What a strong sentiment. Just holding the cool metal in my hand makes me feel good, connected to my parents somehow. I slip it onto the ring finger of my right hand. It\u0027s a perfect fit.\n I slide the drawer back into the dresser and find Maddy in the kitchen.\n \"Do you mind if I keep this?\" I ask her, holding out my hand. \"It\u0027s mom\u0027s original wedding band.\"\n Maddy shakes her head. \"Of course not. You gave me her diamond. It\u0027s only fair.\" She smiles at me now with her best big-sister grin and I can\u0027t help but give her a hug.\n \"I love you, you know,\" I tell her as we settle into her kitchen chairs, our elbows propped on the table. \"Mom and dad would be really proud of you.\"\n She smiles at me again and sips her chocolate. \"Thank you. They\u0027d be proud of you, too. They always were.\"\n I lean into her and try to steal her cup and she slaps my hand away.\n \"How many of those have you had, anyway?\" I demand jokingly. \"Surely you can spare one cup for me.\"\n \"I already did,\" she answers. \"And I\u0027ve probably had enough. But can you ever really have too much chocolate?\" She waggles her eyebrows and laughs and we chat for what seems like forever.\n After we talk about The Hill, Tony, my shop, Madison\u0027s new car and the dog that she is thinking of getting, she turns to me and looks thoughtful.\n \"How are things with Pax?\"\n I roll my eyes. \"As if you care.\"\n \"I do,\" she insists. \"I\u0027m still worried, but I\u0027m less worried now than I was. He seems to make you happy. And I really do want you to be happy, little sis.\"\n She wraps her slender arm around my shoulder and squeezes. I sniff at her.\n \"Did you put deodorant on today? Because you kind of smell.\"\n We giggle and she slugs me and all feels right in the world.\n We sit in her kitchen and talk until dark. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/if-you-stay-beautifully-broken-1/page-18.html","bookId":2758,"book":{"id":2758,"title":"If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1)","description":"Storyline: \n If You Stay (Beautifully Broken #1) \n 24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole. \n Seriously. \n He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. \n But he’s got his reasons. \n His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why.
