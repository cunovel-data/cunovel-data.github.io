And Pully and Skwish will have announced your return. Taloned toes are tapping the floorboards, I would wager.’\\n\\n ‘Go down there,’ she commanded, facing the inn. ‘Escort them back here-I will be in the tavern.’\\n\\n ‘And if the tavern is not big enough?’\\n\\n An odd concern. She began walking towards the entrance. ‘Then they can perch on shoulders like the crows they are, Yedan.’\\n\\n ‘Twilight.’\\n\\n She half turned.\\n\\n Yedan was tightening the straps of his helm once again. ‘Do not do it.’\\n\\n ‘Do not do what?’\\n\\n ‘Send us to war, sister.’\\n\\n She studied him.\\n\\n But he said nothing more, and a moment later he had turned away and set off down towards the village.\\n\\n She resumed her walk, while her soldiers led the mounts towards the stable, the beasts’ hoofs slipping on the slick logs of the courtyard. They had ridden hard, these last horses drawn from a virtually empty garrison fort just north of Tulamesh-reports of bandits had sent the squads into the countryside and they’d yet to return. Yan Tovis believed they would never do so.\\n\\n At the entranceway she paused, looking down at the slab of stone beneath her boots, on which were carved Shake runes.\\n\\n ‘This Raised Stone honours Teyan Atovis, Rise, who was claimed by the Shore 1113th Year of the Isle. Slain by the Letherii for Debts Unremitted.’\\n\\n Yan Tovis grunted. One of her kin, no less, dead a thousand years now. ‘Well, Teyan,’ she muttered, ‘you died of drink, and now your stone straddles the threshold of a tavern.’ True, some list of mysterious, crushing debts had invited his ignoble fall to alcohol and misery, but this grand commemoration had taken a slanted view on the hands guiding the man’s fate. And now… Brullyg would be Rise. Will you wear the crown as well as Teyan did?\\n\\n She pushed open the door and strode inside.\\n\\n The low-ceilinged room was crowded, every face turned to her.\\n\\n A familiar figure pushed into view, her face a mass of wrinkles twisted into a half-smile.\\n\\n ‘Pully,’ Twilight said, nodding. ‘I have just sent the Watch down to the village to find you.’\\n\\n ‘Be well he’ll find Skwish and a score others. They be well weaving cob to web on th’ close sea beyond the shore, Queen, an’ all the truths writ there. Strangers-’\\n\\n ‘I know,’ Yan Tovis interjected, looking past the old hag and scanning the other witches and warlocks, the Shoulderfolk of the Old Ways. Their eyes glittered in the smoky gloom, and Twilight could now smell these Shake elders-half-unravelled damp wool and patchy sealskin, fish-oil and rank sweat, the breath coming from mouths dark with sickened gums or rotting teeth.\\n\\n If there was a proprietor to this tavern he or she had fled. Casks had been broached and tankards filled with pungent ale. A huge pot of fish soup steamed on the centre hearth and there were countless gourd-shell bowls scattered on the tables. Large rats waddled about on the filthy floor.\\n\\n Far more witches than warlocks, she noted. This had been a discernible trend among the demon-kissed-fewer and fewer males born bearing the accepted number of traits; most were far too demonic. More than two hundred of the Shoulderfolk. Gathered here.\\n\\n ‘Queen,’ Pully ventured, ducking her head. ‘Cob to web, all of Shake blood know that you now rule. Barring them that’s on the Isle, who only know that your mother’s dead.’\\n\\n ‘So Brullyg is there, anticipating…’\\n\\n ‘Aye, Twilight, that be well he will be Rise, King of the Shake.’\\n\\n Errant take me. ‘We must sail to the Isle.’\\n\\n A murmur of agreement amidst the eager quaffing of ale.\\n\\n ‘You intend, this night,’ Yan Tovis said, ‘a ritual.’\\n\\n ‘We are loosening the chains as they say, Queen. There are nets be strung across the path of the world, t’see what we catch.’\\n\\n ‘No.’\\n\\n Pully’s black eyes narrowed. ‘What’s that?’\\n\\n ‘No. There will be no ritual tonight. Nor tomorrow night, nor the next. Not until we are on the Isle, and perhaps not even then.’\\n\\n Not a sound in the tavern now.\\n\\n Pully opened her mouth, shut it, then opened it again. ‘Queen, the shore be alive wi’ voices as they say and the words they are for us. These-these they be the Old Ways, our ways-’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-217.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
