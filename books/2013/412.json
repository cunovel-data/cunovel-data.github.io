Onrack and Trull. Go!’\\n\\n The taller man snorted. ‘Enough, Hedge. That oaf understands you just fine.’\\n\\n ‘Oh, so why ain’t he listening to me?’\\n\\n ‘How should I know?’\\n\\n Ulshun waited a moment longer, fixing into his memory the faces of these two men, so that death would not take all of them. He hoped they were doing the same with him, although of course they might well not understand the gift, nor even that they had given it.\\n\\n Imass knew many truths that were lost to those who were, in every sense, their children. This, alas, did not make Imass superior, for most of those truths were unpleasant ones, and these children could not defend themselves against them, and so would be fatally weakened by their recognition.\\n\\n For example, Ulshun Pral reminded himself, he had been waiting for this time, understanding all that was coming to this moment, all the truths bound within what would happen. Unlike his people, he had not been a ghost memory. He had not lived countless millennia in a haze of self-delusion. Oh, his life had spanned that time, but it had been just that: a life. Drawn out to near immortality, not through any soul-destroying ritual, but because of this realm. This deathless realm.\\n\\n That was deathless no longer.\\n\\n He set out, then, leaving these two brave children, and made his way towards the cave.\\n\\n It might begin here, beneath this empty sky. But it would end, Ulshun Pral knew, before the Gates of Starvald Demelain.\\n\\n Where a Bentract Bonecaster had failed. Not because the wound proved too virulent, or too vast. But because the Bonecaster had been nothing more than a ghost to begin with. A faded, pallid soul, a thing with barely enough power to hold on to itself.\\n\\n Ulshun Pral was twenty paces from the entrance to the cave when Onrack the Broken emerged, and in Ulshun’s heart there burgeoned such a welling of pride that tears filled his eyes.\\n\\n ‘So I take it,’ Hedge said, locking the foot of his crossbow, ‘that what we were both thinking means neither of us is much surprised.’\\n\\n ‘She gave in too easily.’\\n\\n Hedge nodded. ‘That she did. But I’m still wondering, Quick, why didn’t she grab that damned Finnest a long time ago? Squirrel it away some place where Silchas Ruin would never find it? Answer me that!’\\n\\n The wizard grunted as he moved out to the crest of the slope. ‘She probably thought she’d done just as you said, Hedge.’\\n\\n Hedge blinked, then frowned. ‘Huh. Hadn’t thought of that.’\\n\\n ‘That’s because you’re thick, sapper. Now, if this goes the way I want it to, you won’t be needed at all. Keep that in mind, Hedge. I’m begging you.’\\n\\n ‘Oh, just get on with it.’\\n\\n ‘Fine then. I will.’\\n\\n And Ben Adaephon Delat straightened, then slowly raised his arms.\\n\\n His scrawny arms. Hedge laughed.\\n\\n The wizard glared back at him over a shoulder. ‘Will you stop that?’\\n\\n ‘Sorry! Had no idea you were so touchy.’\\n\\n Quick Ben cursed, then turned and walked back to Hedge.\\n\\n And punched him in the nose.\\n\\n Stunned, eyes filling with tears, the sapper staggered back. Brought a hand to his face to stem the sudden gushing of blood. ‘You broke my damned nose!’\\n\\n ‘So I did,’ the wizard answered, shaking one hand. And look, Hedge, you’re bleeding.’\\n\\n ‘Is it any surprise? Ow-’\\n\\n ‘Hedge. You are bleeding.’\\n\\n I’m-oh, gods.\\n\\n ‘Get it now?’\\n\\n And Quick turned and walked back, resumed his stance at the crest.\\n\\n Hedge stared down at his bloody hand. ‘Shit!’\\n\\n Their conversation stopped then.\\n\\n Since the three dragons were now no longer tiny specks.\\n\\n Menandore’s hatred of her sisters in no way diminished her respect for their power, and against Silchas Ruin that power would be needed. She knew that the three of them, together, could destroy that bastard. Utterly. True, one or two of them might fall. But not Menandore. She had plans to ensure that she would survive.\\n\\n Before her now, minuscule on the edge of that rise, a lone mortal-the other one was crouching as if in terror, well behind his braver but equally stupid companion-a lone mortal, raising his hands.\\n\\n Oh, mage, to think that will be enough.\\n\\n Against us!\\n\\n Power burgeoned within her and to either side she felt the same-sudden pressure, sudden promise.\\n\\n Angling downward now, three man-heights from the basin’s tawny grasses, huge shadows drawing closer, yet closer. Sleeting towards that slope. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-412.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
