Living, breathing, farting… He reached out and cuffed the man in the side of the head.\\n\\n ‘Hey, what’s that for?’\\n\\n ‘No reason, but I’m sure I was owed doing that at least once.’\\n\\n ‘Who saved your skin in the desert? And under the city?’\\n\\n ‘Some ghost up to no good,’ Fiddler replied.\\n\\n ‘Hood, that white beard makes you look ancient, Fid, you know that?’\\n\\n Oh, be quiet.\\n\\n ‘Crossbows loaded, everyone? Good. Lead on, Cuttle, but slow and careful, right?’\\n\\n They were five paces into the corridor when a side entrance ahead and to their right was suddenly filled with figures. And mayhem was let loose once more.\\n\\n Tarr saw the old man first, the one in the lead, or even if he didn’t see him first, he got off his shot before anyone else. And the quarrel sank into the side of the man’s head, dead in the centre of his left temple. And everything sprayed out the other side.\\n\\n Other quarrels caught him, at least two, spinning his scrawny but nice-robed body round before it toppled.\\n\\n A handful of guards who had been accompanying the old man reeled back, at least two stuck good, and Tarr was already rushing forward, drawing his shortsword and bringing his shield round. He bumped hard against Corabb who was doing the same and swore as the man got in front of him.\\n\\n Tarr raised his sword, a sudden, overwhelming urge to hammer the blade down on the bastard’s head-but no, save that for the enemy-\\n\\n Who were throwing down their weapons as they backed down the corridor.\\n\\n ‘For Hood’s sake!’ Quick Ben shouted, dragging at Tarr to get past, then shoving Corabb to one side. ‘They’re surrendering, damn you! Stop slaughtering everyone!’\\n\\n And from the Letherii group, a woman’s voice called out in Malazan, ‘We surrender! Don’t kill us!’\\n\\n That voice was enough to draw everyone up.\\n\\n Tarr swung round, as did the others, to look at Fiddler.\\n\\n After a moment, the sergeant nodded. ‘Take ‘em prisoner, then. They can lead us to the damned throne room.’\\n\\n Smiles ran up to the body of the old man and started pulling at all his gaudy rings.\\n\\n A Letherii officer stepped forward, hands raised. ‘There’s no-one in the throne room,’ he said. ‘The Emperor is dead-his body’s in the arena-’\\n\\n ‘Take us there, then,’ Quick Ben demanded, with a glare at Fiddler. ‘I want to see for myself.’\\n\\n The officer nodded. ‘We just came from there, but very well’\\n\\n Fiddler waved his squad forward, then scowled over at Smiles. ‘Do that later, soldier-’\\n\\n She bared her teeth like a dog over a kill, then drew out a large knife and, with two savage chops, took the old man’s pretty hands.\\n\\n Trull Sengar stepped out onto the sand of the arena, eyes fixed on the body lying near the far end. The gleam of coins, the head tilted back. He slowly walked forward.\\n\\n There was chaos in the corridors and chambers of the Eternal Palace. He could search for his parents later, but he suspected he would not find them. They had gone with the rest of the Tiste Edur. Back north. Back to their homeland. And so, in the end, they too had abandoned Rhulad, their youngest son.\\n\\n Why does he lie unmoving? Why has he not returned?\\n\\n He came to Rhulad’s side and fell to his knees. Set down his spear. A missing arm, a missing sword.\\n\\n He reached out and lifted his brother’s head. Heavy, the face so scarred, so twisted with pain that it was hardly recognizable. He settled it into his lap.\\n\\n Twice now, 1 am made to do this. With a brother whose face, there below me, rests too still. Too emptied of life. They look so… wrong.\\n\\n He would have tried, one last time, a final offering of reason to his young brother, an appeal to all that he had once been. Before all this. Before, in foolish but understandable zeal, he had grasped hold of a sword on a field of ice.\\n\\n Rhulad would then, in another moment of weakness, pronounce Trull Shorn. Dead in the eyes of all Tiste Edur. And chain him to stone to await a slow, wasting death. Or the rise of water.\\n\\n Trull had come, yes, to forgive him. It was the cry in his heart, a cry he had lived with for what seemed for ever. You were wounded, brother. So wounded. He had cut you down, laid you low but not dead. He had done what he needed to do, to end your nightmare. But you did not see it that way. You could not.\\n\\n Instead, you saw your brothers abandon you.\\n\\n So now, my brother, as I forgive you, will you now forgive me? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-463.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
