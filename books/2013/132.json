Chancellor or no, I will have his answer.’ ‘I did not think we’d take the whore yet,’ Tanal said, retrieving his own wine. He watched over the rim of the goblet as Karos pulled the soaked cloth away, revealing the terrible assault done on his face as he gingerly sipped at the wine-wincing as the alcohol bit into gashes and cuts. ‘Perhaps the Edur should have been first. Bruthen Trana-he did not seem such a viper. He said not a word, revealed nothing-’ ‘Of course not. Nor would I in his place. No. Wait, observe, then strike without warning. Yes, I underestimated him. Well, such a failing occurs but once. Tonight, Tanal Yathvanar, a war has begun. And this time the Letherii will not lose.’ Another sip. ‘I am relieved,’ he then said, ‘that you got rid of that academic-too bad you did not get Nisall to play with, but I needed to act quickly. Tell me how you disposed of her-the academic. I need some satisfying news for a change…’ Tanal stared at the man. If not you… From the corridor, rushing feet. The healers had arrived. ‘Commander,’ K’ar Penath said as he hurried alongside Bruthen Trana, ‘do we seek audience with the Emperor?’ ‘No. Not yet. We will watch all of this play out for a time.’ And the bodies?’ ‘Hide them well, warlock. And inform Hannan Mosag that I wish to speak to him. As soon as possible.’ ‘Sir, he is not in the Emperor’s favour at the moment-’ You misunderstand me, warlock. This has nothing to do with Rhulad. Not yet. We conquered this empire. It seems rhe Letherii have forgotten that. The time has come to stir the Tiste Edur awake once more. To deliver terror, to make our displeasure clear. This night, K’ar, the weapons are drawn.’ ‘You speak of civil war, Commander.’ ‘In a manner of speaking, although I expect nothing overt from the Chancellor or Invictad. A war, yes, but one waged behind the Emperor’s back. He will know nothing-’ ‘Commander-’ ‘Your shock at my words does not convince me. Hannan Mosag is no fool-nor are you or any of his other warlocks. Tell me now you anticipated nothing… ah, I thought as much.’ ‘I fear we are not ready-’ ‘We aren’t. But neither were they. This taking Nisall-this murder-tells me something gave them reason to panic. We need to find out what. Something has happened, or is happening even now, that forced matters to a head. And that is the trail Hannan Mosag must pursue-no, I do not presume to command him-’ ‘I understand, Bruthen Trana. You speak as a Tiste Edur. I will support your advice to the Warlock King with all my zeal.’ ‘Thank you.’ ‘Tonight, Commander,’ K’ar Penath said, ‘in witnessing you… I was proud. We are… awakened, as you said. This civilization, it is a poison. A rot upon our souls. It must be excised.’ And now I hear Hannan Mosag speaking through you, warlock. Answering other… suspicions. So be it. Nisall. First Concubine, I am sorry. But know this, 1 will avenge you in truth. As I will avenge my brave warrior-Sister take me, that was careless- ‘The Chancellor will speak to the Emperor-’ ‘Only if he is stupid,’ Bruthen Trana said, ‘or inclined to panic. He is neither. No, he needs to be pushed, kept off balance-oh, we will deliver panic, yes, and sooner or later he will do as you say. Speak to Rhulad. And then we will have him. And Invictad. Two snakes in the same basket-a basket soaked in oil. And it will be Triban Gnol himself who strikes the spark.’ ‘How?’ ‘You will see.’ Tehol stared down through the roof hatch in unmitigated horror. ‘That was a mistake,’ he said. Leaning beside him, also looking down, Bugg nodded. ‘It was an act of mercy, Master. Twelve hens in a sack, half crushing each other, jostled about in fetid darkness. There was the risk of suffocation.’ ‘Precisely! Peaceful demise, remote, unseen. No wringing of necks required! But now look at them! They’ve taken over our room! My house. My abode, my very hearth-’ ‘About that-seems one of them has caught fire, Master.’ ‘It’s smouldering, and too brainless to care. If we wait we can dine on roast chicken for breakfast. And which one laid that egg?’","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-132.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
