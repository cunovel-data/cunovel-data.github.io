Allow us to introduce ourselves…\\n\\n Trull Sengar gently lifted Seren’s arms and stepped back from her embrace. She almost sagged forward, not wanting the moment to end, and something cold formed a fist in her stomach. Wincing, she turned away.\\n\\n ‘Seren-’\\n\\n She waved a hand, then met his eyes once more.\\n\\n ‘My brother. My parents.’\\n\\n ‘Yes,’ she said.\\n\\n ‘I cannot pretend that they are not there. That they mean nothing to me.’\\n\\n She nodded, not trusting herself to speak.\\n\\n He crossed the dusty room, kicking through rubbish-the place had been stripped of virtually everything, no matter how worthless. They had lain together on their cloaks, watched by spiders in the corners near the ceiling and bats slung in a row beneath a window sill. He picked up the Imass spear from where it leaned against a wall and faced her, offering a faint smile. ‘I can protect myself. And alone, I can move quickly-’\\n\\n ‘Go, then,’ she said, and felt anguish at the sudden hardness in her voice.\\n\\n His half-smile held a moment longer, then he nodded and walked into the corridor that led to the front door.\\n\\n After a moment Seren Pedac followed. ‘Trull-’\\n\\n He paused at the doorway. ‘I understand, Seren. It’s all right.’\\n\\n No it’s not all right! ‘Please,’ she said, ‘come back.’\\n\\n ‘I will. I can do nothing else. You have all there is of me, all that’s left.’\\n\\n ‘Then I have all I need,’ she replied.\\n\\n He reached out, one hand brushing her cheek.\\n\\n And then was gone.\\n\\n Emerging from the pathway crossing the yard, Trull Sengar, the butt of the spear ringing like the heel of a staff on the cobbles, walked out into the street.\\n\\n And set off in the direction of the Eternal Domicile.\\n\\n From the shadows of an alley opposite, the Errant watched him.\\n\\n ‘I feel much better.’\\n\\n Brys Beddict smiled across at his brother. ‘You look it. So, Tehol, your manservant is an Elder God.’\\n\\n ‘I’ll take anybody I can find.’\\n\\n ‘Why are your eyes two different colours now?’\\n\\n ‘I’m not sure, but I think Bugg may be colour blind. Blue and green, green and blue, and as for brown, forget it.’\\n\\n Said manservant who happened to be an Elder God walked into the room. ‘I found her.’\\n\\n Tehol was on his feet. ‘Where? Is she alive?’\\n\\n ‘Yes, but we’ve work to do… again.’\\n\\n ‘We need to find that man, that Tanal-’\\n\\n ‘No need for that,’ Bugg replied, eyes settling on the corpse of Karos Invictad.\\n\\n Brys did the same. A two-headed insect was slowly making its way towards the spilled entrails. ‘What in the Errant’s name is that?’\\n\\n And Bugg hissed through his teeth. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘he’s next.’\\n\\n Outside, in the compound, in the street beyond, a mass of citizens were gathering. Their sound was like an advancing tide. There had been some thunderous explosions, and the unmistakable roar of sorcery, from the direction of the Eternal Domicile, but that had all been short-lived.\\n\\n Tehol faced Bugg, ‘Listen to that mob. We going to be able to leave here alive? I’m really not in the mood for a Drowning. Especially my own.’\\n\\n Brys grunted. ‘You’ve not been paying attention, brother. You’re a hero. They want to see you.’\\n\\n ‘I am? Why, I never imagined that they had it in them.’\\n\\n ‘They didn’t,’ Bugg replied, with a sour expression. ‘Ormly and Rucket have spent a fortune on criers.’ Brys smiled. ‘Humbled, Tehol?’\\n\\n ‘Never. Bugg, take me to Janath. Please.’ At that, Brys Beddict’s brows rose. Ah, it is that way, then. Well. Good.\\n\\n A surviving officer of the city garrison formally surrendered to the Adjunct just inside the west gate, and now Tavore led her occupying army into Letheras.\\n\\n Leaving Fist Blistig in charge of the main force, she assembled the five hundred or so surviving marines, along with Fist Keneb, and her own troop of mounted cavalry, and set out for the imperial palace. This ill-named ‘Eternal Domicile’.\\n\\n Sinn, riding behind Lostara Yil, had cried out when the dragon had appeared over the city; then had laughed and clapped her hands when at least two cussers and then wave after wave of ferocious sorcery routed the creature.\\n\\n Captain Faradan Sort’s advance squads were still active-that much had been made abundantly clear. And they were at the palace, or at least very close. And they were in a mood. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-460.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
