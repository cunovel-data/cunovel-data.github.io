You cruel, heartless-’\\n\\n ‘The observation was made regarding all mortals, actually.’\\n\\n ‘He didn’t take it that way!’\\n\\n Janath spoke from where she sat sipping from her own chipped clay cup. ‘All those alarms ringing through the city are because of you, Tehol Beddict?’\\n\\n ‘They will be on the lookout now,’ Bugg observed, ‘for a man wearing a blanket.’\\n\\n ‘Well,’ Tehol retorted, ‘there must be plenty of those, right?’\\n\\n There was no immediate reply.\\n\\n ‘There must be,’ Tehol insisted, a little wildly even to his iown ears. He hastened on in a more reasonable tone. ‘The ever growing divide between the rich and the poor and all that. Why, blankets are the new fashion among the destitute. I’m sure of it.’\\n\\n Neither listener said anything, then both sipped from their cups.\\n\\n Scowling, Tehol said, ‘What’s that you’re drinking?’\\n\\n ‘Hen tea,’ Bugg said.\\n\\n ‘Soup, you mean.’\\n\\n ‘No,’ said Janath. ‘Tea.’\\n\\n ‘Wait, where are all the chickens?’\\n\\n ‘On the roof,’ Bugg said.\\n\\n ‘Won’t they fall off?’\\n\\n ‘One or two might. We do regular rounds. So far, they have displayed uncharacteristic cleverness. Rather unique for this household.’\\n\\n ‘Oh right, kick the exhausted fugitive why don’t you? They probably caught poor old Ublala.’\\n\\n ‘Maybe. He did have a diversion in mind.’\\n\\n Tehol’s eyes narrowed on his manservant. ‘Those wisps above your ears need trimming. Janath, find me a knife, will you?’.\\n\\n ‘No.’\\n\\n ‘You would side with him, wouldn’t you?’\\n\\n ‘Bugg is actually a very capable man, Tehol. You don’t deserve him, you know.’\\n\\n ‘I assure you, Scholar, the undeservedness is mutual.’\\n\\n ‘What does that mean?’\\n\\n ‘You know, from the smell I think I could make a strong argument that hen tea is no different from watery chicken soup, or, at the very least, broth.’\\n\\n ‘You never could grasp semantics, Tehol Beddict.’\\n\\n ‘I couldn’t grasp much of anything, I seem to recall. Yet I will defend my diligence, my single-minded lust for seductive knowledge, the purity of true academic… uh, pursuit-why, I could go on and on-’\\n\\n ‘Ever your flaw, Tehol.’\\n\\n ‘-but I won’t, cursed as I am with an unappreciative audience. So tell me, Bugg, why was Ublala so eager to talk to this true blood Tarthenal?’\\n\\n ‘He wishes to discover, I imagine, if the warrior is a god.’\\n\\n ‘A what?’\\n\\n ‘A new god, I mean. Or an ascendant, to be more precise. I doubt there are worshippers involved. Yet.’\\n\\n ‘Well, Tarthenal only worship what terrifies them, right? This is just some warrior doomed to die by the Emperor’s sword. Hardly the subject to inspire poor Ublala Pung.’\\n\\n To that Bugg simply shrugged.\\n\\n Tehol wiped sweat from his brow. ‘Give me some of that hen tea, will you?’\\n\\n ‘With or without?’\\n\\n ‘With or without what?’\\n\\n ‘Feathers.’\\n\\n ‘That depends. Are they clean feathers?’\\n\\n ‘They are now,’ Bugg replied.\\n\\n All right, then, since I can’t think of anything more absurd. With.’\\n\\n Bugg reached for a clay cup. ‘I knew I could count on you, Master.’\\n\\n She woke to a metallic clang out in the corridor.\\n\\n Sitting up, Samar Dev stared into the darkness of her room.\\n\\n She thought she could hear breathing, just outside her door, then, distinctly, a muted whimper.\\n\\n She rose, wrapping the blanket about her, and padded to the doorway. Lifted the latch and swung the flimsy barrier aside.\\n\\n ‘Karsa?’\\n\\n The huge figure spun to face her.\\n\\n ‘No,’ she then said. ‘Not Karsa. Who are you?’\\n\\n ‘Where is he?’\\n\\n ‘Who?’\\n\\n ‘The one like me. Which room?’\\n\\n Samar Dev edged out into the corridor. She looked to the left and saw the motionless forms of the two palace guards normally stationed to either side of the corridor’s entranceway. Their helmed heads were conspicuously close together, and those iron pots were both severely dented. ‘You killed them?’\\n\\n The huge man glanced over, then grunted. ‘They were looking the wrong way.’\\n\\n ‘You mean they didn’t see you.’\\n\\n ‘Maybe my hands.’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-164.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
