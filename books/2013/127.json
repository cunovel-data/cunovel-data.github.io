{"id":104240,"no":127,"title":"Page 127","content":"The emotions commanding him were similarly simple and straightforward. He feared what he could not understand, and he despised what he feared. But acknowledging fear did not make him a coward-for he had proclaimed for himself an eternal war against all that threatened him, be it a devious wife who had raised walls round her soul, or conspirators against the empire of Lether. His enemies, he well understood, were the true cowards. They thought within clouds that obscured all the harsh truths of the world. Their struggles to ‘understand’ led, inevitably, to seditious positions against authority. Even as they forgave the empire’s enemies, they condemned the weaknesses of their own homeland-not recognizing that they themselves personified such weaknesses.\n An empire such as Lether was ever under siege. This had been the first statement uttered by Karos Invictad during the recruitment and training process, and Sirryn Kanar had understood the truth of that with barely a moment’s thought. A siege, inside and out, yes-the very privileges the empire granted were exploited by those who would see the empire destroyed. And there could be no room for ‘understanding’ such people-they were evil, and evil must be expurgated.\n The vision of Karos Invictad had struck him with the force of revelation, yielding such perfect clarity and, indeed, peace in what had been, at times, a soul in turmoil-battered and assailed on occasion by a world blurry with confusion and uncertainty-that all that raged within him settled out as certainty arrived, blazing and blinding in its wondrous gift of release.\n He now lived an untroubled life, and so set an example to his fellow agents in the palace. In their eyes he had seen, again and again, the glimmer of awe and fear, or, equally satisfying, a perfect reflection of his own-flat, remorseless, as impervious to every deceit the enemy might attempt as he himself was.\n Untroubled, then, he gestured to two burly Patriotists who stepped forward and kicked in the door. It virtually flew off its flimsy hinges, crashing down into the opulent chamber beyond. A scream, then another, from the gloom to the left-where the handmaidens slept-but already the lead agents were crossing the room to the door opposite. More violence, wood splintering beneath heavy boots.\n Sprawled in the hallway behind Sirryn was the corpse of a Tiste Edur-someone had set a guard. Curious, but of little consequence. Poisoned quarrels had proved both quick and virtually silent. Already two of his men were preparing to carry the corpse away-just one more Edur who mysteriously vanished.\n Sirryn Kanar positioned himself in the centre of the first chamber, as another agent arrived with a hooded lantern to stand off to one side, shedding just enough light. Too much would not do-the shadows needed to be alive, writhing, confusion on all sides. Sirryn delighted in precision.\n His men emerged from the inner room, a figure between them-half naked, hair tousled, a look of disbelief-No. Sirryn Kanar’s eyes narrowed. Not disbelief. Resignation. Good, the traitor knew her fate, knew she could never escape it. Saying nothing, he gestured for his agents to take her out.\n Three handmaidens, weeping now, huddled against the wall, near their sleeping pallets. ‘Attend to them,’ Sirryn commanded, and four from his squad moved towards them. ‘The senior one will be questioned, the other two disposed of immediately.’\n He looked around, pleased at the ease of this operation, barely noticing the death-cries of two women.\n In a short while, he would deliver his two prisoners to the squad waiting at a side postern of the palace, who would move quickly through the night-alone on the streets this long after curfew-to the headquarters of the Patriotists. Deliver the two women into interrogation cells. And the work would begin, the only release from the ordeal full confession of their crimes against the empire.\n A simple, straightforward procedure. Proven effective. Traitors were invariably weak of will.\n And Sirryn Kanar did not think the First Concubine would be any different. If anything, even more flimsy of spirit than most.\n Women delighted in their airs of mystery, but those airs vanished before the storm of a man’s will. True, whores hid things better than most-behind an endless succession of lies that never fooled him. He knew they were contemptU’ ous of him and men like him, believing him weak by simple virtue of his using them-as if that use came from actual, genuine need. But he had always known how to wipe the smirks from their painted faces.\n He envied the interrogators. That bitch Nisall-she was no different from his wife, he suspected.\n Our enemies are legion, Karos lnvictad had said, so you must understand, all of you-this war, it will last for ever. For ever.\n Sirryn Kanar was content with that notion. Kept things simple. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-127.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: \n All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
