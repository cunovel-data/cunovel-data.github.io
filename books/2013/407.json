She fixed on them her hardest glare as she drew up to the edge of the crest. ‘You two are pathetic. Why stand here-do you know who approaches? Do you know they will come from the south? Meaning that you two will be the first they see. And so, the first they kill.’ The taller, darker-skinned one turned slightly, then said, ‘Here comes your son, Menandore. With Ulshun Pral.’ He then frowned. ‘That’s a familiar walk… Wonder why I never noticed that before.’ Walk? Familiar walk? He is truly mad. ‘I have summoned them,’ she said, crossing her arms. ‘We must prepare for the battle.’ The shorter one grunted, then said, ‘We don’t want any company. So pick somewhere else to do your fighting.’ ‘I am tempted to crush your skull between my hands,’ Menandore said. ‘Doesn’t work,’ the wizard muttered. ‘Everything just pops back out.’ The one with the crossbow gave her a wide smile. Menandore said, ‘I assure you, I have no intention of being anywhere near you, although it is my hope I will be within range to see your grisly deaths.’ ‘What makes you so sure they’ll be grisly?’ the wizard asked, now studying one pebble in particular, holding it up to the light as if it was a gem of some sort, but Menandore could see that it was not a gem. Simply a stone, and an opaque one at that. ‘What are you doing?’ she demanded. He glanced across at her, then closed his hand round the stone and brought it down behind his back. ‘Nothing. Why? Anyway, I asked you a question.’ ‘And I am obliged to answer it?’ She snorted. Rud Elalle and Ulshun Pral arrived, halting a few paces behind the wizard and his companion. Menandore saw the hard expression in her son’s face. Could I have seen anything else? No. Not for this. ‘Beloved son-’ ‘I care nothing for the Finnest,’ Rud Elalle said. ‘I will not join you in your fight, Mother.’ She stared, eyes widening even as they filled with burning rage. ‘You must! I cannot face them both!’ ‘You have new allies,’ Rud Elalle said. ‘These two, who even now guard the approach-’ ‘These brainless dolts? My son, you send me to my death!’ Rud Elalle straightened. ‘I am taking my Imass away from here, Mother. They are all that matters to me-’ ‘More than the life of your mother?’ ‘More than the fight she chooses for herself!’ he snapped. ‘This clash-this feud-it is not mine. It is yours. It was ever yours! I want nothing to do with it!’ Menandore flinched back at her son’s fury. Sought to hold his eyes, then failed and looked away. ‘So be it,’ she whispered. ‘Go then, my son, and take your chosen kin. Go!’ As Rud Elalle nodded and turned away, however, she spoke again, in a tone harder than anything that had come before. ‘But not him.’ Her son swung round, saw his mother pointing towards the Imass at his side. Ulshun Pral. Rud Elalle frowned. ‘What? I do not-’ ‘No, my son, you do not. Ulshun Pral must remain. Here.’ ‘I will not permit-’ And then the Bentract leader reached out a hand to stay Rud Elalle-who was moments from veering into his dragon form, to lock in battle with his own mother. Menandore waited, outwardly calm, reposed, even as her heart thudded fierce in her chest. ‘She speaks true,’ Ulshun Pral said. ‘I must stay.’ ‘But why?’ ‘For the secret I possess, Rud Elalle. The secret they all seek. If I go with you, all will pursue. Do you understand? Now, I beg you, lead my people away from here, to a safe place. Lead them away, Rud Elalle, and quickly!’ ‘Will you now fight at my side, my son?’ Menandore demanded. ‘To ensure the life of Ulshun Pral?’ But Ulshun Pral was already pushing Rud Elalle away. ‘Do as I ask,’ he said to Menandore’s son. ‘I cannot die fearing for my people-please, lead them away.’ The wizard then spoke up, ‘We’ll do our best to safeguard him, Rud Elalle.’ Menandore snorted her contempt. ‘You risk such a thing?’ she demanded of her son. Rud Elalle stared across at the wizard, then at the smiling one with the crossbow, and she saw a strange calm slip over her son’s expression-and that sliver of disquiet returned to her, stinging. ‘I shall,’ Rud Elalle then said, and he reached out to Ulshun Pral. A gentle gesture, a hand resting lightly against one side of the Imass’s face. Rud Elalle then stepped back, swung round, and set off back for the camp.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-407.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
