Besides,’ he added, ‘what ails him isn’t entirely natural.’\\n\\n Silchas Ruin, facing the trail they would climb this day, said, ‘He speaks true. Old sorcery fills this fetid air.’\\n\\n ‘What kind?’ Seren asked.\\n\\n ‘It is fragmented. Perhaps… K’Chain Che’Malle-they rarely used their magic in ways easily understood. Never in battle. I do recall something… necromantic’\\n\\n And is that what this is?’\\n\\n ‘I cannot say, Acquitor.’\\n\\n ‘So why is Udinaas the one afflicted? What about the rest of us?’\\n\\n No-one ventured a response, barring another broken laugh from Udinaas.\\n\\n Rings clacked. ‘I have made my suggestion,’ Clip said.\\n\\n Again, the conversation seemed to die. Kettle walked over to stand close to Udinaas, as if conferring protection.\\n\\n The small campfire was finally alight, if feebly so. Seren collected a tin pot and set out to find some clean snow, which should have been a simple enough task. But the rotted patches were foul with detritus. Smears of decaying vegetation, speckled layers of charcoal and ash, the carcasses of some kind of ice-dwelling worm or beetle, wood and pieces of countless animals. Hardly palatable. She was surprised they weren’t all sick.\\n\\n She halted before a long, narrow stretch of ice-crusted snow that filled a crack or fold in the rock. She drew her knife, knelt down and began pecking at it. Chunks broke away. She examined each one, discarding those too dis-coloured with filth, setting the others into the pot. Not much like normal glaciers-those few she had seen up close. After all, they were made of successive snowfalls as much as creeping ice. Those snowfalls normally produced relatively pristine strata. But here, it was as if the air through which the snow fell had been thick with drifting refuse, clogging every descending flake. Air thick with smoke, ash, pieces of once living things. What could have done that? If just ash then she could interpret it as the result of some volcanic eruption. But not damned fragments of skin and meat. What secret hides in these mountains?\\n\\n She managed to dig the knife-point deep into the ice, j then settled her weight on it. The entire remaining slab of ice lifted suddenly, prised away from the crack. And there, lying beneath it, a spear.\\n\\n The shaft, long as Seren was tall, was not wood. Polished, mottled amber and brown, it looked almost… scaled. The broad head was of one piece, blade and stem, ground jade, milky smooth and leaf-shaped. No obvious glue or binding held the socket onto the shaft.\\n\\n She pulled the weapon loose. The scaled texture, she saw, was created by successive, intricate layering of horn, which explained the mottled appearance. Again, she could discern no indication of how the layers were fixed. The spear was surprisingly heavy, as if the shaft had mineralized.\\n\\n A voice spoke behind her. ‘Now that is an interesting find.’\\n\\n She turned, studied Clip’s mocking expression, and felt a flash of irritation. ‘In the habit of following people around, Clip?’\\n\\n ‘No, mostly I lead them. I know, that task serves to push you to one side. Leaves you feeling useless.’\\n\\n ‘Any other bright observations you want to make?’\\n\\n He shrugged, spinning the damned chain back and forth. ‘That spear you found. It’s T’lan Imass.’\\n\\n ‘Is that supposed to mean something to me?’\\n\\n ‘It will.’\\n\\n ‘It’s not a weapon you fight with, is it?’\\n\\n ‘No. And I don’t hide in trees and throw fruit either.’\\n\\n She frowned.\\n\\n He laughed, turning away. ‘I was born in Darkness, Acquitor.’\\n\\n And?’\\n\\n He paused, glanced back at her. ‘Why do you think I am rhe Mortal Sword of the Black-Winged Lord? My good looks? My charming personality? My skill with these blades here?’\\n\\n ‘Well,’ she replied, ‘you’ve just exhausted my list of reasons.’\\n\\n ‘Ha ha. Hear me. Born in Darkness. Blessed by our Mother. The first in thousands of years-she turned away, you know. From her chosen sons. Thousands of years? More like tens of thousands. But not from me. I can walk the Darkness, Acquitor.’ He waved his chain-spinning hand back towards the others. ‘Not even Silchas Ruin can make that claim.’\\n\\n ‘Does he know?’\\n\\n ‘No. This is our secret for as long as you choose.’\\n\\n And why would I choose to not tell him this, Clip?’\\n\\n ‘Because I am the only one here who can keep him from killing you. You and Udinaas-the two he considers most useless. Indeed, potential enemies.’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-172.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
