It’s my belief in my own efficacy that has taken a beating.’\\n\\n ‘We spin and swirl on the currents of fate, do we?’\\n\\n ‘If you like.’ She sighed. ‘Very well, I’ve seen enough. Besides, it will be curfew soon, and I gather guards kill lawbreakers on sight.’\\n\\n ‘You have seen-but you explain nothing!’\\n\\n ‘Sorry, Taxilian. All of this requires… some thought. If I reach any spectacular conclusions any time soon.I will be sure to let you know.’\\n\\n ‘Do I deserve such irony?’\\n\\n ‘No, you don’t. Alas.’\\n\\n Bugg finally made his way round the corner, emerging from the alley’s gloom then pausing in the sunlit street. He glanced over at Tehol, who stood leaning against a wall, arms crossed beneath his blanket, which he had wrapped about him like a robe. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘why do you hesitate now?’\\n\\n ‘Me? Why, this only appears to be hesitation. You know, you could have let me help you carry that.’\\n\\n Bugg set the heavy sack down. ‘You never offered.’\\n\\n ‘Well, that would be unseemly. You should have insisted.’ Are you sure you have that right, Master?’\\n\\n ‘Not in the least, but some graciousness on your part would have helped us move past this awkward moment.’ From the bag came soft clucking sounds. Tehol blinked down at it. ‘Bugg, you said retired hens, Correct?’\\n\\n ‘I did. In exchange for some modest repairs to a water trough.’\\n\\n ‘But… they’re not dead.’\\n\\n ‘No, Master.’\\n\\n ‘But… that means one of us has to kill them. Wring their necks. See the light of life dim in their beady eyes. You are a hard man, Bugg.’\\n\\n ‘Me?’\\n\\n ‘Retired-their egg-laying days over. Isn’t there some kind of pasture awaiting them? Some well-strewn pecking ground?’\\n\\n ‘Only the one in the sky, Master. But I see your point. About killing them, I mean.’\\n\\n ‘Blood on your hands, Bugg-I’m glad I’m not you.’\\n\\n ‘This is ridiculous. We’ll figure something out when we get back home.’\\n\\n ‘We could build us a coop on the roof, as mad folk do for pigeons. That way the birds could fly in and out, back and forth, and see something of this fine city.’\\n\\n ‘Chickens can’t fly, Master.’\\n\\n ‘Beats wringing their necks, though, don’t you think?’\\n\\n ‘Seeing the city?’\\n\\n ‘Well, momentarily.’\\n\\n Clearly satisfied with his solution, Tehol adjusted his blanket then walked out onto the street. Sighing, Bugg collected the sack with its dozen hens and followed at a somewhat slower pace.\\n\\n ‘Well,’ he said as he joined Tehol in front of the ruin, ‘at least that foreign witch is gone.’\\n\\n ‘She was a foreign witch? Rather pretty, in a stolid, earthy way. All right, handsome, then, although I assure you I would never say that to her face, knowing how women are so easily offended.’\\n\\n ‘By a compliment?’\\n\\n ‘Absolutely. If it is the wrong compliment. You have been… inactive far too long, dear Bugg.’\\n\\n ‘Possibly. I am also reticent when it comes to compliments. They have a way of coming after you.’\\n\\n Tehol glanced over at him, brows lifted. ‘Sounds like you’ve been married once or twice.’\\n\\n ‘Once or twice,’ Bugg replied, grimacing. Glancing up at the ruined Scale House, he went very still. ‘Ah, I see now what she no doubt saw.’\\n\\n ‘If what you are seeing is the source for making the hairs of my neck stand on end every time I come here, then I would be pleased if you explained.’\\n\\n ‘For someone to step inside,’ Bugg said, ‘of necessity there must be a door. And if one does not exist, one must be made.’\\n\\n ‘How can a collapsed building be a door, Bugg?’\\n\\n ‘I begin to comprehend what is coming.’\\n\\n ‘Sufficient to suggest a course of action?’\\n\\n ‘In this matter, Master, the best course is to do nothing.’\\n\\n ‘Hold on, Bugg, that particular conclusion seems to crop up rather often with you.’\\n\\n ‘We’d best get home before curfew, Master. Care to take a turn with this sack?’\\n\\n ‘Errant’s blessing, have you lost your mind?’\\n\\n ‘I thought as much.’\\n\\n There was little in Sirryn Kanar’s thoughts that reached down to the depths of his soul-he had a sense of that, sufficient to make him recognize that he was blessed with a virtually untroubled life. He possessed a wife frightened enough to do whatever he told her to do. His three children held him in the proper mixture of respect and terror, and he had seen in his eldest son the development of similar traits of dominance and certainty. His position as a lieutenant in the Palace Cell of the Patriotists did not, as far as he was concerned, conflict with his official title of Sergeant of the Guard-protection of the powerful demanded both overt and covert diligence, after all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-126.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
