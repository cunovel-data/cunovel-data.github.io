The other woman has been beheaded.’\\n\\n Bruthen Trana carefully rolled the sheet of vellum and slipped it beneath his hauberk. Then he reached out and dragged Karos Invictad to his feet.\\n\\n He struck the man again, then again. Gouts of blood, broken teeth, threads of crimson spit.\\n\\n Again. Again.\\n\\n The reek of urine.\\n\\n Bruthen Trana took handfuls of the silk beneath the flaccid neck and shook the Letherii, hard, watching the head snap back and forth. He kept shaking him.\\n\\n Until a hand closed on his wrist.\\n\\n Through a red haze, Bruthen Trana looked over, met the calm eyes of K’ar Penath.\\n\\n ‘Commander, if you continue so with this unconscious man, you will break his neck.’\\n\\n ‘Your point, warlock?’\\n\\n ‘The First Concubine is dead, by his hand. Is it for you to exact this punishment?’\\n\\n ‘Sister take you,’ Bruthen Trana growled, then he flung Karos Invictad to the floor. ‘Both bodies come with us.’\\n\\n ‘Commander, the Chancellor-’\\n\\n ‘Never mind him, K’ar Penath. Wrap well the bodies. We return to the Eternal Domicile.’\\n\\n ‘What of the dead Letherii below?’\\n\\n ‘His guards? What of them? They chose to step into our path, warlock.’\\n\\n ‘As you say. But with their healer dead, some of them will bleed out unless we call upon-’\\n\\n ‘Not our concern,’ Bruthen Trana said. K’ar Penath bowed. ‘As you say, Commander.’\\n\\n Half blind with terror, Tanal Yathvanar approached the entrance to the headquarters. She was gone. Gone, from that place, that most hidden place-her shackle snapped, the iron bent and twisted, the links of the chain parted as if they were nothing but damp clay.\\n\\n Karos lnvictad, it was your work. Again. Yet another warn-ing to me-do as you command. You know all, you see all. For you, nothing but games, ones where you make certain you always win. But she was not a game. Not for me, you bastard. I loved her-where is she? What have you done with her?\\n\\n Slowly, it registered upon him that something was amiss. Guards running in the compound. Shouts, wavering torchlight. The front entrance to the building yawned wide-he saw a pair of boots, attached to motionless legs, prone across the threshold.\\n\\n Errant take us, we have been attacked!\\n\\n He hurried forward.\\n\\n A guard emerged, stepping over the body.\\n\\n ‘You!’ shouted Tanal. ‘What has happened here?’\\n\\n A rough salute. The man’s face was pale. ‘We have called for healers, sir-’\\n\\n ‘What has happened, damn you?’\\n\\n ‘Edur-a vicious ambush-we did not expect-’\\n\\n ‘The Master?’\\n\\n Alive. But beaten badly. Beaten, sir, by a Tiste Edur! The liaison-Trana-Bruthen Trana-’\\n\\n Tanal Yathvanar pushed past the fool, into the hallway, to the stairs. More bodies, guards cut down without so much as their weapons drawn. What initiated this from the Edur? Did they catch word of our investigations? Bruthen Trana does his file remain? Damn him, why didn’t he just kill the bustard? Choke the life from him-make his face as red as those damned silks? Oh, I would run this differently indeed. Given the chance-\\n\\n He reached the office, stumbled to a halt upon seeing the spattered blood on the walls, the pools of it on the floor. The reek of piss was heavy in the air. Looking small and broken, Karos Invictad sat hunched in his oversized chair, stained cloths held to his swollen, bruised face. In the man’s eyes, a rage as sharp as diamonds. Fixing now upon Tanal Yathvanar.\\n\\n ‘Master! Healers are on the way-’\\n\\n From mashed lips, muffled words: ‘Where were you?’\\n\\n ‘What? Why, at home. In bed.’\\n\\n ‘We arrested Nisall tonight.’\\n\\n Tanal looked about. ‘I was not informed, sir-’\\n\\n ‘No-no-one could find you! Not at your home-not anywhere!’\\n\\n ‘Sir, has Bruthen Trana retrieved the whore, then?’\\n\\n A hacking, muffled laugh. ‘Oh yes. Her cold flesh-but not her spirit. But he carries her written confession-by the Holds, it hurts to speak! He broke my face!’\\n\\n And how many times did your fist do the same to a prisoner? ‘Will you risk some wine, sir?’\\n\\n A glare above the cloths, then a sharp nod.\\n\\n Tanal went quickly to the cabinet. Found a clay jug containing undiluted wine. A better smell than-the piss of your terror, little man. He poured a goblet, then hesitated-and poured another for himself. Damn you, why not? ‘The healers will be here soon-I informed the guards that any delay risks their lives.’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-131.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
