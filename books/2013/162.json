I dare not.’\n ‘Am I to travel alone?’\n ‘For you to decide, Bruthen Trana. But before all else, you must get something-an item-from the Letherii slave. Feather Witch-she hides beneath the Old Palace-’\n ‘I know those tunnels, Warlock King. What is this item?’\n Hannan Mosag told him.\n He studied the twisted warlock for a moment longer-the avid gleam in Hannan Mosag’s eyes bright as fever-then spun round and strode from the chamber.\n Bearing lanterns, the squad of guards formed a pool of lurid yellow light that glimmered along the waters of Quillas Canal as they trudged, amidst clanking weapons and desultory muttering, across the bridge. Once on the other side, the squad turned right to follow the main avenue towards the Creeper district.\n As soon as the glow trundled away, Tehol nudged Ublala and they hurried onto the bridge. Glancing back at the half-blood, Tehol scowled, then hissed, ‘Watch me, you fool! See? I’m skulking. No-hunch down, look about suspiciously, skitter this way and that. Duck down, Ublala!’\n ‘But then I can’t see.’\n ‘Quiet!’\n ‘Sorry. Can we get off this bridge?’\n ‘First, let me see you skulk. Go on, you need to practise.’\n Grumbling, Ublala Pung hunched low, his beetled brow rippling as he looked first one way, then the other.\n ‘Nice,’ Tehol said. ‘Now, hurry up and skulk after me.’\n ‘All right, Tehol. It’s just that there’s the curfew, and I don’t want trouble.’\n They reached the other side and Tehol led the way, thirty paces into the wake of the guards, then an abrupt cut to the left, coming within sight of the Tolls Repository. Into an alley, where he crouched, then gestured frantically for Ublala to do the same.\n ‘All right,’ he whispered, ‘do you know which wing?’\n Ublala blinked in the gloom. ‘What?’\n ‘Do you know where this Tarthenal is quartered?’\n ‘Yes. With all the other champions.’\n ‘Good. Where is that?’\n ‘Well, it must be somewhere.’\n ‘Good thinking, Ublala. Now, stay close to me. I am, after all, a master of this thieving skulduggery.’\n ‘Really? But Bugg said-’\n ‘What? What did my miserable manservant say? About me? Behind my back?’\n Ublala shrugged. ‘Lots of things. I mean, nothing. Oh, you misheard me, Tehol. I didn’t say anything. You’re not a clumsy oaf with a head full of grander delusions, or anything. Like that.’ He brightened. ‘You want me to box him about the ears again?’\n ‘Later. Here’s what I think. Near the Imperial Barracks, but a wing of the Eternal Domicile. Or between the Eternal Domicile and the Old Palace.’\n Ublala was nodding.\n ‘So,’ Tehol continued, ‘shall we get going?’\n ‘Where?’\n ‘Somehow I don’t think this night is going to go well. Never mind, just stay with me.’\n A quick peek into the street, up one way, down the other, then Tehol moved out, keeping low against the near wall. As they drew closer to the Eternal Domicile, the shadows diminished-lantern poles at intersections, broader streets, and there soldiers positioned at postern gates, outside corner blockhouses, soldiers, in fact, everywhere.\n Tehol tugged Ublala into the last usable alley, where they crouched once more in gloom. ‘This looks bad,’ he whispered. ‘There’s people, Ublala. Well, listen, it was a good try. But we’ve been bested by superior security and that’s that.’\n ‘They’re all standing in their own light,’ Ublala said. ‘They can’t see nothing, Tehol. Besides, 1 got in mind a diversion.’\n ‘A diversion like your usual diversions, Ublala? Forget it. Shurq Elalle’s told me about that last time-’\n ‘Yes, like that. It worked, didn’t it?’\n ‘But that was to get her inside the Gerrun Estate-her, not you. Aren’t you the one who wants to talk to this champion?’\n ‘That’s why you’re doing the diversion, Tehol.’\n ‘Me? Are you mad?’\n ‘It’s the only way.’\n They heard the scuff of boots from the street, then a loud voice: ‘There! Who’s skulking in that alley?’\n Ublala flinched down. ‘How did he know?’\n ‘We better run!’\n They bolted, as a spear of lantern-light lanced across the alley mouth; then, pursued by shouting soldiers, the two fugitives reached the far end of the alley. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-162.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: \n All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
