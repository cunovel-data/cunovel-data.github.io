And if that’s not misery enough, they know it, too.’\\n\\n ‘You need clout,’ he said.\\n\\n ‘Clever man.’\\n\\n ‘Even as a child, you were prone to sarcasm.’\\n\\n ‘Sorry.’\\n\\n ‘The answer, I think, will be found with these Tiste Andii.’\\n\\n She looked across at him. ‘What do you mean?’\\n\\n ‘Who knows more of our past than even the witches? Who knows it as a clean thing? A thing not all twisted by generations of corruption, of half-remembrances and convenient lies?’\\n\\n ‘Your tongue runs away with you, Yedan.’\\n\\n ‘More sarcasm.’\\n\\n ‘No, I find myself somewhat impressed.’\\n\\n The jaw bunched as he studied her.\\n\\n She laughed. Could not help it. ‘Oh, brother, come-the foreigners are gone and probably won’t be back-ever.’\\n\\n ‘They sail to their annihilation?’\\n\\n ‘What do you think?’\\n\\n ‘I’m not sure, Twilight. That child mage, Sinn…’\\n\\n ‘You may be right. News of her imminent departure had Pully and Skwish dancing.’\\n\\n ‘She destroyed a solid wall of ice half as long as Fent Reach. I would not discount these Malazans.’\\n\\n ‘The Adjunct did not impress me,’ Yan Tovis said.\\n\\n ‘Maybe because she didn’t need to.’\\n\\n Twilight thought about that, then thought about it some more.\\n\\n Neither spoke as they turned away from the glittering bay and the now-distant foreign ships.\\n\\n The morning sun was actually beginning to feel warm-the final, most poignant proof that the ice was dead, the threat past. The Isle would live on.\\n\\n On the street ahead the first bucket of night-soil slopped down onto the clean cobbles from a second-storey window, forcing passers-by to dance aside.\\n\\n ‘The people greet you, Queen.’\\n\\n ‘Oh, be quiet, Yedan.’\\n\\n Captain Kindly stood by the port rail, staring across the choppy waves to the Silanda. Soldiers from both of the squads on that haunted ship were visible on the deck, a handful gathered about a game of bones or some such nefarious activity, whilst the sweeps churned the water in steady rhythm. Masan Gilani was up near the steering oar, keeping Sergeant Cord company.\\n\\n Lucky bastard, that Cord. Lieutenant Pores, positioned on Kindly’s right, leaned his forearms on the rail, eyes fixed on Masan Gilani-as were, in all likelihood, the eyes of most of the sailors on this escort, those not busy readying the sails at any rate.\\n\\n ‘Lieutenant.’\\n\\n ‘Sir?’\\n\\n ‘What do you think you are doing?’\\n\\n ‘Uh, nothing, sir.’\\n\\n ‘You’re leaning on the gunnel. At ease. Did I at any time say “at ease”, Lieutenant?’\\n\\n Pores straightened. ‘Sorry, sir.’\\n\\n ‘That woman should be put up on report.’\\n\\n Aye, she’s not wearing much, is she?’\\n\\n ‘Out of uniform.’\\n\\n ‘Damned distracting, isn’t it, sir?’\\n\\n ‘Disappointing, you mean, surely, Lieutenant.’\\n\\n ‘Ah, that’s the word I was looking for, all right. Thank you, sir.’\\n\\n ‘The Shake make the most extraordinary combs,’ Kindly said. ‘Turtleshell.’\\n\\n ‘Impressive, sir.’\\n\\n ‘Expensive purchases, but well worth it, I should judge.’\\n\\n ‘Yes sir. Tried them yet?’\\n\\n ‘Lieutenant, do you imagine that to be amusing?’\\n\\n ‘Sir? No, of course not!’\\n\\n ‘Because, as is readily apparent, Lieutenant, your commanding officer has very little hair.’\\n\\n ‘If by that you mean on your head, then yes sir, that is, uh, apparent indeed.’\\n\\n ‘Am I infested with lice, then, that I might need to use a comb elsewhere on my body, Lieutenant?’\\n\\n ‘I wouldn’t know, sir. I mean, of course not.’\\n\\n ‘Lieutenant, I want you to go to my cabin and prepare the disciplinary report on that soldier over there.’\\n\\n ‘But sir, she’s a marine.’\\n\\n ‘Said report to be forwarded to Fist Keneb when such communication is practicable. Well, why are you still standing here? Get out of my sight, and no limping!’\\n\\n ‘Limp’s long gone, sir!’\\n\\n Pores saluted then hurried away, trying not to limp. The problem was, it had become something of a habit when he was around Captain Kindly. Granted, a most pathetic attempt at eliciting some sympathy. Kindly had no sympathy. He had no friends, either. Except for his combs. And they’re all teeth and no bite,’ he murmured as he descended to Kindly’s cabin. ‘Turtleshell, ooh!’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-345.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
