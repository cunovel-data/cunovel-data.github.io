I stay as I am, suitably attractive-’\\n\\n ‘Outwardly, yes.’\\n\\n ‘And have you taken the time to look inward, Banaschar?’\\n\\n ‘I would not do such a thing without your permission.’\\n\\n ‘I give it. Delve deep, High Priest.’\\n\\n His gaze fixed on her, but slowly surrendered its focus. A moment passed, then he paled, blinked and stepped back. ‘Gods below, what is that V\\n\\n ‘I don’t know what you mean, good sir.’\\n\\n ‘There are… roots… filling your entire being. Every vein and artery, the thinnest capillaries… alive…’\\n\\n ‘My ootooloo-they said it would take over, eventually. Its appetites are’-she smiled-‘boundless. But I have learned to control them, more or less. It possesses its own rigour, yes?’\\n\\n ‘You are dead and yet not dead, not any more-but what lives within you, what has claimed your entire body, Shurq Elalle, it is alien. A parasite!’\\n\\n ‘Beats fleas.’\\n\\n He gaped.\\n\\n She grew impatient with his burgeoning alarm. ‘Errant take your rituals. I am content enough as I am, or will be once I get scoured out and some new spices stuffed-’\\n\\n ‘Stop, please.’\\n\\n ‘As you like. Is there something else you wanted to discuss? Truth is, I have little time for high priests. As if piety comes from gaudy robes and self-righteous arrogance. Show me a priest who knows how to dance and I might bask in his measure, for a time. Otherwise…’\\n\\n He bowed. ‘Forgive me, then.’\\n\\n ‘Forget trying to resurrect your faith, Banaschar, and try finding for yourself a more worthy ritual of living.’\\n\\n He backed away, and very nearly collided with the Adjunct and Tavore’s ever-present bodyguard, Lostara Yil. Another hasty bow, then flight down the steps.\\n\\n The Adjunct frowned at Shurq Elalle. ‘It seems you are upsetting my other passengers, Captain.’\\n\\n ‘Not my concern, Adjunct. I would be of better service if I was on my own ship.’\\n\\n ‘You lack confidence in your first mate?’\\n\\n ‘My incomplete specimen of a human? Why would you imagine that?’\\n\\n Lostara Yil snorted, then pointedly ignored the Adjunct’s quick warning glance.\\n\\n ‘I will have many questions to ask you, Captain,’ Tavore said. ‘Especially the closer we get to Letheras. And I will of course value your answers.’\\n\\n ‘You are being too bold,’ Shurq Elalle said, ‘heading straight for the capital.’\\n\\n ‘Answers, not advice.’\\n\\n Shurq Elalle shrugged. ‘I had an uncle who chose to leave Letheras and live with the Meckros. He wasn’t much for listening to advice either. So off he went, and then, not so long ago, there was a ship, a Meckros ship from one of their floating cities south of Pilott-and they told tales of a sister city being destroyed by ice, then vanishing-almost no wreckage left behind at all-and no survivors. Probably straight down to the deep. That hapless city was the one my uncle lived on.’\\n\\n ‘Then you should have learned a most wise lesson,’ Lostara Yil said in a rather dry tone that hinted of self-mockery.\\n\\n ‘CM*\\n\\n ‘Yes. People who make up their minds about something never listen to advice-especially when it’s to the contrary.’\\n\\n ‘Well said.’ Shurq Elalle smiled at the tattooed woman. ‘Frustrating, isn’t it?’\\n\\n ‘If you two are done with your not very subtle complaints,’ the Adjunct said, ‘I wish to ask the captain here about the Letherii secret police, the Patriotists.’\\n\\n ‘Ah well,’ Shurq Elalle said, ‘that is not a fun subject. Not fun at all.’\\n\\n ‘I am not interested in fun,’ Tavore said.\\n\\n And one look at her, Shurq Elalle reflected, was proof enough of that.\\n\\n With twelve of his most loyal guards from the Eternal Domicile, Sirryn marched up Kravos Hill, the west wall of Letheras two thousand paces behind him. The tents of the\\n\\n ¦\\n\\n Imperial Brigade dominated in the midst of ancillary companies and lesser brigades, although the Tiste Edur encampment, situated slightly apart from the rest, to the north, looked substantial-at least two or three thousand of the damned savages, Sirryn judged.\\n\\n Atop Kravos Hill stood half a dozen Letherii officers and a contingent of Tiste Edur, among them Hanradi Khalag. Sirryn withdrew a scroll and said to the once-king, ‘I am here to deliver the Chancellor’s orders.’\\n\\n Expressionless, Hanradi reached out for the scroll, then passed it on to one of his aides without looking at it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-348.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
