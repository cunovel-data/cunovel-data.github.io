He returned to where his soldiers waited, catching their breaths in the centre of the flat rooftop. ‘All right,’ he said, setting down his crossbow and opening his satchel, ‘there’s a gate that I can take out with a cusser from here. Then down we go and straight across and straight in, fast and mean. Kill everyone in sight, understood?’ He drew out his cusser quarrel and carefully loaded the crossbow. Then resumed his instructions. ‘Tarr takes up the rear crossing the street. Bottle, keep everything you got right at hand-’ ‘Sergeant-’ ‘Not now, Corabb. Listen! We’re heading for the throne room. I want Cuttle out front-’ ‘Sergeant-’ ‘-with sharpers in hand. Koryk, you’re next-’ ‘Sergeant-’ ‘What in Hood’s name is it, Corabb?’ The man was pointing. Northward. Fiddler and the others all turned. To see an enormous white dragon bearing down on them. An infrequent scattering of cut-down Letherii soldiers and small fires left behind by munitions had provided enough of a trail for Quick Ben and Hedge, and they were now crouched at the foot of a door to a burnt-out building. ‘Listen,’ Hedge was insisting, ‘the roof here’s right opposite the gate. I know Fid and I’m telling you, he’s on that Hood-damned roof!’ ‘Fine, fine, lead on, sapper.’ Quick Ben shook his head. Something… I don’t know… They plunged inside. The stench of smoke was acrid, biting. Charred wreckage lay all about, the detritus of a ruined empire. ‘There,’ Hedge said, then headed on into a corridor, down to a set of stairs leading upward. Something…oh, gods! ‘Move it!’ Quick Ben snarled, shoving the sapper forward. ‘What-’ ‘Hurry!’ The huge dragon angled down, straight for them. Fiddler stared for a moment longer, seeing the beast opening its mouth, knowing what was coming, then he raised his crossbow and fired. The bolt shot upward. A hind limb of the dragon snapped out to bat the quarrel aside. And the cusser detonated. The explosion flattened the marines on the rooftop, sent Fiddler tumbling backward. The roof itself sagged beneath them with grinding, crunching sounds. Fiddler caught a glimpse of the dragon, streaming blood, its chest torn open, sliding off to one side, heading towards the street below, shredded wings flailing like sails in a storm. A second bolt flew out to intercept it. Another explosion, sending the dragon lurching back, down, into a building, which suddenly folded inward on that side, then collapsed with a deafening roar. Fiddler twisted round- – and saw Hedge. – and Quick Ben, who was running towards the roof’s edge, his hands raised and sorcery building round him as if he was the prow of a ship cutting through water. Fiddler leapt to his feet and followed the wizard. From the wreckage of the building beside the Eternal Domicile, the dragon was pulling itself free. Lacerated, bones jutting and blood leaking from terrible wounds. And then, impossibly, it rose skyward once more, rent wings flapping-but Fiddler knew that it was sorcery that was lifting the creature back into the air. As it cleared the collapsed building, Quick Ben unleashed his magic. A wave of crackling fire crashed into the dragon, sent it reeling back. Another. And then another-the dragon was now two streets away, writhing under the burgeoning assault. Then, with a piercing cry, it wheeled, climbed higher, and flew away, in full retreat. Quick Ben lowered his arms, then fell to his knees. Staring after the fast-diminishing dragon, Fiddler leaned his crossbow onto his shoulder. ‘This ain’t your fight,’ he said to the distant creature. ‘Fucking dragon.’ Then he turned and stared at Hedge. Who, grinning, stared back. ‘No ghost?’ ‘No ghost. Aye, Fid, I’m back.’ Fiddler scowled, then shook his head. ‘Hood help us all.’ Then he turned to Quick Ben. ‘And where in the Abyss have you been?’ Picking himself up from the buckled rooftop, Bottle stared across at those three soldiers. Didn’t know one of them except that he was a sapper. And a damned Bridgeburner. Beside him, Koryk groaned, then spat. ‘Look at ‘em,’ he said. Bottle nodded. And, oddly enough, for all the soldiers in the squad, nothing more about it needed saying.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-459.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
