You no longer interest me.’\\n\\n ‘Good, can I go now?’\\n\\n ‘Yes.’ Karos rose, tapping the sceptre onto one shoulder. ‘And I, alas, must needs escort you.’\\n\\n ‘Good help is hard to keep alive these days.’\\n\\n ‘Stand up, Tehol Beddict.’\\n\\n The man had some difficulty following that instruction, but the Invigilator waited, having learned to be patient with such things.\\n\\n As soon as Tehol fully straightened, however, a look of astonishment lit his features. ‘Why, it’s a two-headed insect! Going round and round!’\\n\\n ‘To the door now,’ Karos said.\\n\\n ‘What’s the challenge?’\\n\\n ‘It is pointless-’\\n\\n ‘Oh now, really, Invigilator. You claim to be smarter than me, and I’m about to die-1 like puzzles. I design them, in fact. Very difficult puzzles.’\\n\\n ‘You are lying. I know all the designers and you do not number among them.’\\n\\n ‘Well, all right. I designed just one.’\\n\\n ‘Too bad, then, you will be unable to offer it to me, for my momentary pleasure, since you are now returning to your cell.’\\n\\n ‘That’s all right,’ Tehol replied. ‘It was more of a joke than a puzzle, anyway.’\\n\\n Karos Invictad grimaced, then waved Tehol towards the door with the sceptre.\\n\\n As he slowly shuffled over, Tehol said, ‘I figured out the challenge, anyway. It’s to make the bug stop going round and round.’\\n\\n The Invigilator blocked him with the sceptre. ‘I told you, there is no solution.’\\n\\n ‘I think there is. I think I know it, in fact. Tell you what, sir. I solve that puzzle there on your desk and you postpone my Drowning. Say, by forty years or so.’\\n\\n ‘Agreed. Because you cannot.’ He watched Tehol Beddict walk like an old man over to the desk. Then lean over. ‘You cannot touch the insect!’\\n\\n ‘Of course,’ Tehol replied. And leaned yet farther over, lowering his face towards the box.\\n\\n Karos Invictad hurried forward to stand beside him. ‘Do not touch!’\\n\\n ‘I won’t.’\\n\\n ‘The tiles can be rearranged, but I assure you-’\\n\\n ‘No need to rearrange the tiles.’\\n\\n Karos Invictad found his heart pounding hard in his chest. ‘You are wasting more of my time.’\\n\\n ‘No, I’m putting an end to your wasting your time, sir.’ He paused, cocked his head. ‘Probably a mistake. Oh well.’\\n\\n And lowered his face down directly over the box, then gusted a sharp breath against one of the tiles. Momentarily clouding it. And the insect, with one of its heads facing that suddenly opaque, suddenly non-reflective surface, simply stopped. Reached up a leg and scratched its abdomen. As the mist cleared on the tile, it scratched once more, then resumed its circling.\\n\\n Tehol straightened. ‘I’m free! Free!’\\n\\n Karos Invictad could not speak for ten, fifteen heartbeats. His chest was suddenly tight, sweat beading on his skin, then he said in a rasp, ‘Don’t be a fool.’\\n\\n ‘You lied? Oh, I can’t believe how you lied to me! Well then, piss on you and your pissy stupid puzzle, too!’\\n\\n The Invigilator’s sceptre swept in an arc, intersecting with that box on the desk, shattering it, sending its wreckage flying across the room. The insect struck a wall and stayed there, then it began climbing towards the ceiling.\\n\\n ‘Run!’ whispered Tehol Beddict. ‘Run!’\\n\\n The sceptre swung next into Tehol’s chest, snapping ribs.\\n\\n ‘Pull the chain tighter on my ankles,’ Janath said. ‘Force my legs wider.’\\n\\n ‘You enjoy being helpless, don’t you?’\\n\\n ‘Yes. Yes!’\\n\\n Smiling, Tanal Yathvanar knelt at the side of the bed.\\n\\n The chain beneath ran through holes in the bed frame at each corner. Pins held the lengths in place. To tighten the ones snaring her ankles all he needed to do was pull a pin on each side at the foot of the bed, drawing the chain down as far as he could, and, as he listened to her moans, replace the pins.\\n\\n Then he rose and sat down on the edge of the bed. Stared down at her. Naked, most of the bruises fading since he no longer liked hurting her. A beautiful body indeed, getting thinner which he preferred in his women. He reached out, then drew his hand away again. He didn’t like any touching until he was ready. She moaned a second time, arching her back.\\n\\n Tanal Yathvanar undressed. Then he crawled up onto the bed, loomed over her with his knees between her legs, his hands pressing down on the mattress to either side of her chest. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-436.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
