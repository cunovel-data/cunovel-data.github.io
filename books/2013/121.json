She closed her eyes-then, at a ragged sigh from Varat Taun, opened them again, to see her second in command’s limbs slowly unfold, the fierce clutch of muscles on his neck visibly ease as the man, blinking, slowly lifted his head.\n And saw her.\n ‘Varat Taun.’\n A faint smile, worn with sorrow-but a natural sorrow. Atri-Preda. We made it back, then…’\n She frowned, then nodded. ‘You did. And since that time, Lieutenant, the fleet has come home.’ She gestured at the room. ‘You are in the Domicile’s Annexe, in Letheras.’\n ‘Letheras? What?’ He struggled to rise, pausing a moment to look wonderingly at the Cabalhii monk; then, using the wall behind him, he straightened and met Twilight’s eyes. ‘But that is impossible. We’d two entire oceans to cross, at the very least-’\n ‘Your escape proved a terrible ordeal, Lieutenant,’ Yan Tovis said. ‘You have lain in a coma for many, many months. I expect you are feeling weak-’\n A grimace. ‘Exhausted, sir.’\n ‘What do you last recall, Lieutenant?’\n Dread filled his wan features and his gaze fell away from hers. ‘Slaughter, sir.’\n ‘Yes. The barbarian known as Taralack Veed survived, as did the Jhag, Icarium-’\n Varat Taun’s head snapped up. ‘Icarium! Yes-Atri-Preda, he-he is an abomination!’\n ‘A moment!’ cried the Senior Assessor, eyes now piercing as he stared at the lieutenant. ‘Icarium, the Jhag Warrior? Icarium, Lifestealer?’\n Suddenly frightened, Yan Tovis said, ‘Yes, Cabalhii. He is here. Like you, he will challenge the Emperor-’ She stopped then, in shock, as the monk, eyes bulging, flung both hands to his face, streaking across the thick paint, and, teeth appearing to clench down hard on his lower lip, bit. Until blood spurted. The monk reeled back until he struck the wall beside the doorway-then, all at once, he whirled about and fled the room.\n ‘Errant take us,’ Varat Taun hissed, ‘what was all that about?’\n Forbidden laughter? She shook her head. ‘I don’t know, Lieutenant.’\n ‘Who… what…?’\n A healer,’ she replied in a shaky voice, forcing herself to draw a steadying breath. ‘The one who awakened you, Varat. A guest of the Emperor’s-from Uruth’s fleet.’\n Varat Taun licked chapped, broken lips. ‘Sir.’\n ‘Yes?’\n ‘Icarium… Errant save us, he must not be awakened. Taralack knows, he was there, he saw. The Jhag… have him sent away, sir-’\n She approached him, boots hard on the floor. ‘The Gral’s claims are not exaggerated, then? He will bring destruction?’\n A whisper: ‘Yes.’\n She could not help herself then, and reached out, gloved hands grasping the front of Varat’s ragged shirt, dragging him close. ‘Tell me, damn you! Can he kill him? Can Icarium kill him?’\n Horror swirled in the soldier’s eyes as he nodded.\n Errant’s blessing, maybe this time… ‘Varat Taun. Listen to me. I am leading my company out in two days. Back to the north. You will ride with me, as far up the coast as necessary then you ride east-to Bluerose. I am assigning you to the Factor’s staff there, understood? Two days.’\n ‘Yes sir.’\n She released him, suddenly embarrassed at her own outburst. Yet her legs were weak as reeds beneath her still. She wiped sweat from her eyes. ‘Welcome back, Lieutenant,’ she said in a rough voice, not meeting his gaze. ‘Are you strong enough to accompany me?’\n ‘Sir. Yes, I shall try.’\n ‘Good.’\n Emerging from the room, they came face to face with the Gral barbarian. Breath hissed from Varat Taun.\n Taralack Veed had halted in the corridor and was staring at the lieutenant. ‘You are… recovered. I did not think-’ He shook his head, then said, ‘I am pleased, soldier-’\n ‘You warned us again and again,’ Varat Taun said.\n The Gral grimaced and seemed ready to spit, then decided otherwise. Gravely, he said, ‘I did. And yes, I was foolish enough to be an eager witness…’\n ‘And next time?’ The question from Varat Taun was a snarl.\n ‘You do not need to ask me that.’\n The lieutenant stared hard at the savage, then he seemed to sag, and Yan Tovis was astonished to see Taralack Veed move forward to take Varat’s weight. Ah, it is what they have shared. It is that. That.\n The Gral glared over at her. ‘He is half dead with exhaustion!’ \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-121.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: \n All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
