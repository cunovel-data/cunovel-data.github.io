{"id":104507,"no":399,"title":"Page 399","content":"Arising in the body of another man should have given him all that a new life promised. But inside, he had remained Toe the Younger. Who had once been a soldier, but was one no longer. Life with the Grey Swords had not altered that. They had travelled to this land, drawn by the Wolves with gifts of faint visions, murky prophecies born in confused dreams: some vast conflagration awaited them-a battle where they would be needed, desperately needed. Not, it had turned out, alongside the Awl. A most fatal error in judgement. The wrong allies. The wrong war. Toc had never trusted the gods anyway. Any god. In truth, his list of those whom he did trust was, after all he had been through, pathetically short. Tatter sail. Ganoes Paran. Gruntle. Tool. A sorceress, a mediocre captain, a caravan guard and a damned T’lan Imass. Would that they were with him now, riding at his side. His horse’s charge was slow, turgid, slewing. Perched over the press of his knees against the beast’s shoulders, Toc sent arrow after arrow towards the skirmishers-though he knew it was hopeless. He could barely see, so jostled was he atop the saddle, with mud flying up on all sides as the horse careered in a wild struggle to stay upright. As he drew closer, he heard screams. With but two arrows left, he rose higher still on his stirrups, drawing on his bowstring- His arrows, he saw with astonishment, had not missed. Not one. Eight skirmishers were down. He sent another hissing outward, saw it take a man in the forehead, the stone point punching through bronze and then bone. Last arrow. Gods- He was suddenly among the Letherii. Driving his last arrow at near point-blank range into a woman’s chest. A spear tore into his left leg, cut through and then gouged along his horse’s flank. The beast screamed, launched itself forward- Tossing the bow away, Toc unsheathed his scimitar-damn, should’ve brought a shield-and hacked from side to side, beating away the thrusting spears.- His horse pulled through into the clear. And would have rushed on, straight into the Letherii ranks two hundred paces ahead, but Toc grasped the reins and swerved the animal round. Only to find a dozen or so skirmishers right behind him-pursuing on foot. Two spears drove into his mount, one skidding off a shoulder blade, the other stabbing deep into the animal’s belly. Squealing piteously, the horse foundered, then fell onto its side, hind legs already fouled with spilled out intestines, each frantic kick tearing more loose from the body cavity. Toc, with legs still drawn high, was able to throw himself from the beast, landing clear. Skidding in the mud, struggling to regain his feet. A spear drove into his right hip, lifting him from the muck before throwing him onto his back. He hacked at the shaft. It splintered and the pressure pinning him down vanished. Slashing blindly, Toc fought his way back onto his feet. There was blood pouring down both legs. Another lunging attack. He parried the spear thrust, lurched close and chopped his scimitar into the side of the soldier’s neck. A point slammed into his back, punched him forward. And onto a shortsword that slid up under his ribs, cutting his heart in half. Toe Anaster sank down onto his knees, and, releasing his last breath, would have fallen forward into the mud, but for a hand grasping him, yanking him back. The flash of a knife before his lone eye. Sudden heat along the line of his jaw- Torrent watched as the Letherii skirmisher cut away Toc Anaster’s face. One more trophy. The task was quick, well-practised, and then the soldier pushed his victim away, and the red wound that had once been Toe’s face plunged down into the mud. The children were crying, and yes, he realized-in watching, in waiting, he had perhaps condemned them all to the Letherii knives. Still, they could- Torrent turned round- And found strangers before him. Not Ak’rynnai. Not D’rhasilhanii. No, he had never before seen such people. The clans of the White Face Barghast approached the scene of the battle-a battle nearing its grisly end. Who won, who lost, was without meaning to them. They intended to kill everyone. Two hundred paces ahead of the ragged lines was their vanguard, walking within a stream of the Tellann Warren, which was strong in this place, where beneath the silts of the ancient shoreline could be found stone tools, harpoons made of antler, bone and ivory, and the hulks of dugout canoes. And out here, on the old seabed, there were offerings buried deep now in the silts. Polished stones, pairs of antlers locked together, animal skulls daubed in red ochre – countless gifts to a dwindling sea.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-399.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
