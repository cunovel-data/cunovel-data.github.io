Not through the grotesque creature that was Hannan Mosag, the Warlock King. The very man who had started the Edur down this path of dissolution. Ambition, greed and betrayal-it was all Bruthen could manage to stand still before Hannan Mosag, rather than strangle the life from the Warlock King.\\n\\n Yet from that twisted mouth had come… hope. It seemed impossible. Macabre. Mocking Bruthen Trana’s visions of heroic salvation. Rhidad falls-the whole Sengar bloodline obliterated-and then… Hannan Mosag. For his crimes. Honour can be won-1 will see to that.\\n\\n This is how it must be.\\n\\n He was not unduly worried over the Letherii. The Chancellor would not live much longer. The palace would be purged. The Patriotists would be crushed, their agents slain, and those poor prisoners whose only crime, as far as he could tell, was to disagree with the practices of the Patriotists-those prisoners, Letherii one and all, could be freed. There was no real sedition at work here. No treason. Karos Invictad used such accusations as if they encompassed a guilt that needed no proof, as if they justified any treatment of the accused he desired. Ironically, in so doing he subverted humanity itself, making him the most profound traitor of all.\\n\\n But not even that mattered much. Bruthen Trana did not like the man, a dislike that seemed reason enough to kill the bastard. Karos Invictad took pleasure in cruelty, making him both pathetic and dangerous. If he were permitted to continue, there was the very real risk that the Letherii people would rise up in true rebellion, and the gutters in every city of the empire would run crimson. No matter. I do not like him. For years I was witness to his contempt for me, there in his eyes. I will brook the affront no longer.\\n\\n This, more than anything else, dismayed Bruthen Trana. Hannan Mosag’s insisting he leave immediately-for some place where the sun dies. West. But no, not west. The Warlock King misunderstood his own vision-\\n\\n A sudden thought, slowing his steps as he made his way down into the subterranean corridors and chambers beneath the Old Palace. Who answered his prayers? Who showed him this path? He suggested it was not this Crippled God. Father Shadow? Has Scabandari Bloodeye returned to us?\\n\\n No, he has not. Then… who?\\n\\n A moment later, Bruthen Trana scowled, then cursed under his breath and resumed his journey. I am given hope and what do I do? Seek to kill it with my own hands. No, I understand the path-better than Hannan Mosag himself.\\n\\n Where the sun dies is not to the west.\\n\\n It is beneath the waves. In the depths.\\n\\n Did not a demon of the seas retrieve his body? No, Hannan Mosag, you dare not name him. He is not even Tiste Edur. Yet he must be our salvation.\\n\\n He reached the sloping tunnel that would take him to the slave’s supposedly secret abode. These Letherii were indeed pathetic.\\n\\n We each carry a whisper of Emurlahn within us-each and every Tiste Edur. This is why no slave among the tribes could escape us.\\n\\n Except for one, he corrected himself. Udinaas. But then, the K’risnan knew where he was-or so Bruthen Trana suspected. They knew, yet chose to do nothing.\\n\\n It was no wonder Rhulad did not trust them.\\n\\n Nor do I.\\n\\n He could smell the stench of bitter magic as he drew nearer, and he heard her muttering in her chamber, and knew that something had changed. In the one named Feather Witch. In the power she possessed.\\n\\n Well, he would give her no time to prepare.\\n\\n Feather Witch looked up in fear and alarm as the Tiste Edur warrior strode in. Squealing, she backed away until brought short by a wall, then sank down and covered her face.\\n\\n The stark intent in the warrior’s face was fierce.\\n\\n He grasped her by the hair and yanked her to her feet, then higher, the pain forcing a shriek from her.\\n\\n With his other hand he grasped the small leather pouch between her breasts. When he tore it loose, the thong cut like wire across the back of her neck and behind one ear. She could feel blood. She thought that her ear had very nearly been cut loose, that it hung by a strand of-\\n\\n He flung her back down. Her head cracked against the stone of the wall. She slumped onto the floor, ragged sobbing erupting from her heaving chest.\\n\\n And listened-beyond the close roar of blood in her skull-to his dwindling footsteps.\\n\\n He had taken the severed finger.\\n\\n He goes to find the soul of Brys Beddict.\\n\\n Tehol staggered into the single room, collapsed down near the hearth.

Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
