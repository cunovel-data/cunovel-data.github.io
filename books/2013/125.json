She started, glared about, sensed a presence behind her and spun round-no-one.\\n\\n ‘Who is here?’ she demanded.\\n\\n ‘Beware the gathering of names… it is… premature…’\\n\\n ‘Name yourself, ghost! I command it.’\\n\\n ‘Oh, compulsion is ever the weapon of the undeserving. Let us instead bargain in faith. That severed finger you keep round your neck, Caster, what do you intend with it?’\\n\\n She clutched at the object. ‘I will not tell you-’\\n\\n ‘Then I in turn will reveal to you the same-nothing.’\\n\\n She hesitated. ‘Can you not guess?’\\n\\n ‘Ah, and have I guessed correctly?’\\n\\n ‘Yes.’\\n\\n ‘Premature.’\\n\\n ‘I am biding my time, ghost-I am no fool.’\\n\\n ‘No indeed,’ the ghost replied. ‘Even so, let us extend the bargain-’\\n\\n ‘Why? You have revealed nothing of yourself-’\\n\\n ‘Patience. Caster of the Tiles, await my… encouragement. Before you do what you intend. Await me, and I will assist you.’\\n\\n She snorted. ‘You are a ghost. You have no power-’\\n\\n ‘I am a ghost, and that is precisely why I have power. For what you seek, that is.’\\n\\n ‘Why should I believe you? Why should I agree to anything you suggest?’\\n\\n ‘Very well, my part of the bargain. You speak now with Kuru Qan, once Ceda to King Ezgara Diskanar.’\\n\\n ‘Slain by Trull Sengar…’\\n\\n Something like a chuckle. ‘Well, someone needed to thrust the spear…’\\n\\n ‘You knew it was coming?’\\n\\n ‘Knowing and being able to do something about it are two different matters, Caster of the Tiles. In any case, lay the true blame at the Errant’s feet. And I admit, I am of a mind to call him out on that, eventually. But like you, I understand the necessity of biding one’s time. Have we a bargain?’\\n\\n She licked her lips, then nodded. ‘We have.’\\n\\n ‘Then I shall leave you to your education. Be careful when casting your tiles-you risk much by so revealing your talents as a seer.’\\n\\n ‘But I must know-’\\n\\n ‘Knowing and being able to do something about it-’\\n\\n ‘Yes,’ she snapped, ‘I heard you the first time.’\\n\\n ‘You lack respect, girl.’\\n\\n ‘And be glad of it.’\\n\\n ‘You may have a point there. Worth some consideration, I think.’\\n\\n ‘Do you now intend to spy on me my every moment down here?’\\n\\n ‘No, that would be cruel, not to mention dull. When I come here, you shall be warned-the wind, the mist, yes? Now, witness its vanishing.’\\n\\n She stared down at the swirling cloud, watched as it faded, then was gone.\\n\\n Silence in the chamber, the air still beyond her own breath. Kuru Qan, the Cedal See how I gather allies. Oh, this shall be sweet vengeance indeed!\\n\\n The waning sun’s shafts of dusty light cut across the space where the old temple had stood, although the wreckage filling the lower half of that gap was swallowed in gloom. Fragments of facade were scattered on the street-pieces of rats in dismaying profusion. Edging closer, Samar Dev kicked at the rubble, frowning down at the disarticulated stone rodents. ‘This is most… alarming,’ she said.\\n\\n ‘Ah,’ Taxilian said, smiling, ‘now the witch speaks. Tell me, what do you sense in this fell place?’\\n\\n ‘Too many spirits to count,’ she murmured. And all of them… rats.’\\n\\n ‘There was a D’ivers once, wasn’t there? A terrible demonic thing that travelled the merchant roads across Seven Cities-’\\n\\n ‘Gryllen.’\\n\\n ‘Yes, that was its name! So, do we have here another such… Gryllen?’\\n\\n She shook her head. ‘No, this feels older, by far.’\\n\\n And what of that bleeding? Of power?’\\n\\n ‘I’m not sure.’ Glancing around, she saw a tall, cloaked man leaning against a wall on the other side of the street, watching them. ‘Some things, long ago grinding to a halt, should never be reawakened. Alas…’\\n\\n Taxilian sighed. ‘You use that word a lot. “Alas”. You are too resigned, Samar Dev. You flee from your own curiosity-I do not think you were always like this.’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-125.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
