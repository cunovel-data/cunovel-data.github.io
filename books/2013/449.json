Mosag, Menandore, Sukul Ankhadu, blah blah.’ He waved one hand. ‘But we’re here, sweetness. We got its name, y’see.’\\n\\n The Jaghut cocked her head. ‘Then, I am not needed.’\\n\\n ‘Well, that’s true enough. Unless you care for a drink?’ He tugged the jug free of Pinosel’s grip, raised it.\\n\\n The Jaghut stared a moment longer, then she said, ‘A pleasing offer, thank you.’\\n\\n The damned sun was up, but on this side the city’s wall was all shadow. Except, Sergeant Balm saw, for the wide open gate.\\n\\n Ahead, Masan Gilani did that unthinkable thing again and rose in her stirrups, leaning forward as she urged her horse into a gallop.\\n\\n From just behind Balm, Throatslitter moaned like a puppy under a brick. Balm shook his head. Another sick thought just popping into his head like a squeezed tick. Where was he getting them from anyway? And why was that gate open and why were they all riding hard straight for it?\\n\\n And was that corpses he saw just inside? Figures moving about amidst smoke? Weapons?\\n\\n What was that sound from the other side of that gate?\\n\\n ‘Sharpers!’ Deadsmell called out behind him. ‘Keneb’s in! He’s holding the gate!’\\n\\n Keneb? Who in Hood’s name was Keneb?\\n\\n ‘Ride!’ Balm shouted. ‘They’re after us! Ride for Aren!’\\n\\n Masan Gilani’s rising and lowering butt swept into the shadow of the gate.\\n\\n Throatslitter cried out and that was the sound all right, when the cat dives under the cartwheel and things go squirt and it wasn’t his fault he’d hardly kicked at all. ‘It dived out there, Ma! Oh, I hate cities! Let’s go home-ride! Through that hole! What’s it called? The big false-arched canti-levered hole!’\\n\\n Plunging into gloom, horse hoofs suddenly skidding, the entire beast slewing round beneath him. Impact. Hip to rump, and Balm was thrown, arms reaching out, wrapping tight round a soft yielding assembly of perfected flesh-and she yelped, pulled with him as he plunged past dragging Masan Gilani from her saddle.\\n\\n Hard onto cobbles, Balm’s head slamming down, denting and dislodging his helm. Her weight deliciously flattening him for a single exquisite moment before she rolled off.\\n\\n Horses stumbling, hoofs cracking down way too close. Soldiers rushing in, pulling them clear.\\n\\n Balm stared up into a familiar face. ‘Thorn Tissy, you ain’t dead?’\\n\\n The ugly face spread into a toad’s grin-toad under a brick oh they smile wide then don’t they-and then a calloused hand slapped him hard. ‘You with us, Balm? Glad you arrived-we’re getting pressed here-seems the whole damned city garrison is here, tryin’ to retake the gate.’\\n\\n ‘Garrison? What’s Blistig thinking? We’re on his side! Show me the famous dancing girls of Aren, Tissy, that’s what I’m here to see and maybe more than see, hey?’\\n\\n Thorn Tissy dragged Balm onto his feet, set the dented helm back onto Balm’s head, then he took him by the shoulders and turned him round.\\n\\n And there was Keneb, and there, just beyond, barricades of wreckage and soldiers crouching down reloading crossbows while others hacked at Letherii soldiers trying to force a breach. Somewhere to the right a sharper detonated in an alley mouth where the enemy had been gathering for another rush. People screamed.\\n\\n Fist Keneb stepped up to Balm. ‘Where are the rest, Sergeant?’\\n\\n ‘Sir?’\\n\\n ‘The Adjunct and the army!’\\n\\n ‘In the transports, sir, where else? Worst storm I’ve ever seen and now all the ships are upside down-’\\n\\n Behind Balm Deadsmell said, ‘Fist, they should be on the march.’\\n\\n ‘Get Masan Gilani back on her horse,’ Keneb said and Balm wanted to kiss the man, ‘and I don’t care if she kills the beast but I want her to reach the Adjunct-they need to step it up. Send their cavalry ahead riding hard.’\\n\\n ‘Yes sir.’\\n\\n ‘We’re running low on munitions and quarrels and there’s more of the Letherii gathering with every damned breath and if they find a decent commander we won’t be able to hold.’\\n\\n Was the Fist talking to Balm? He wasn’t sure, but he wanted to turn round to watch Masan Gilani jump with her legs spread onto that horse’s back, oh yes he did, but these hands on his shoulders wouldn’t let him and someone was whimpering in his ear- \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-449.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
