{"id":104330,"no":220,"title":"Page 220","content":"A dragon through fire, a ship riding flames-his first sight of a Tiste Edur: dead, pinned to his chair by a giant’s spear. Oar benches where sat decapitated rowers, hands resting on the sweeps, and their severed heads heaped in a pile round the mainmast, eyes blinking in the sudden light, faces twisting into appalling expressions-\n So who built twelve wells in a forest? That’s what I want to know.\n Maybe.\n He recalled a knock at the door, and opening it to see, with absurd delight, a drenched T’lan Imass whom he recognized. Stormy, it’s for you. And aye, I dream of moments like this, you red-haired ox. And what did that say about Gesler himself? Wait, I’m not that curious.\n ‘There you are.’\n Gesler looked up. ‘Stormy. I was just thinking of you.’\n ‘Thinking what?’\n He waved at the well’s black hole. ‘If you’d fit, of course. Most of you would go, but not, alas, your head.’\n ‘You keep forgetting, Gesler,’ the corporal said as he drew nearer, ‘I was one of the ones who punched back.’\n ‘Got no recollection of that at all.’\n ‘Want me to remind you?’\n ‘What I want is to know why you’re bothering me.’\n ‘We’re all gettin’ ready to head out.’\n ‘Stormy.’\n ‘What?’\n ‘What do you think about all this?’\n ‘Someone liked building wells.’\n ‘Not this. I mean, the war. This war, the one here.’\n ‘I’ll let you know once we start busting heads.’\n ‘And if that never happens?’\n Stormy shrugged, ran thick fingers through his knotted beard. ‘Just another typical Bonehunter war, then.’\n Gesler grunted. ‘Go on, lead the way. Wait. How many battles have we fought, you and me?’\n ‘You mean, with each other?’\n ‘No, you damned idiot. I mean against other people. How many?’\n ‘I lost count.’\n ‘Liar.’\n ‘All right. Thirty-seven, but not counting Y’Ghatan since I wasn’t there. Thirty-eight for you, Gesler.’\n And how many did we manage to avoid?’\n ‘Hundreds.’\n ‘So maybe, old friend, we’re just getting better at this.’\n The huge Falari scowled. ‘You trying to ruin my day, Sergeant?’\n Koryk tightened the straps of his bulky pack. ‘I just want to kill someone,’ he growled.\n Bottle rubbed at his face then eyed the half-blood Seti.\n ‘There’s always Smiles. Or Tarr, if you jump him when he’s not looking.’\n ‘You being funny?’\n ‘No, just trying to deflect your attention from the weakest guy in this squad. Namely, me.’\n ‘You’re a mage. Sort of. You smell like one, anyway.’\n ‘What does that mean?’\n ‘If I kill you, you’d just curse me with your last breath, then I’d be miserable.’\n ‘So what would change, Koryk?’\n ‘Having a reason to be miserable is always worse than having no reason but being miserable anyway. If it’s just a way of life, I mean.’ He suddenly drew out the latest weapon in his arsenal, a long-knife. ‘See this? Just like the kind Kalam used. It’s a damned fast weapon, but I can’t see it doing much against armour.’\n ‘Where Kalam stuck them there wasn’t no armour. Throat, armpit, crotch-you should give it to Smiles.’\n ‘I grabbed it to keep it from her, idiot.’\n Bottle looked over to where Smiles had, moments earlier, disappeared into the forest. She was on her way back, the placid expression on her face hiding all sorts of evil, no doubt. ‘I hope we’re not expected to stand against Edur the way heavies are,’ he said to Koryk while watching Smiles. ‘Apart from you and Tarr, and maybe Corabb, we’re not a big mailed fist kind of squad, are we? So, in a way, this kind of war suits us-subterfuge, covert stuff.’ He glanced over and saw the half-blood glaring at him. Still holding the long-knife. ‘But maybe we’re actually more versatile. We can be half mailed fist and half black glove, right?’\n ‘Anyway,’ Koryk said, resheathing the weapon, ‘when I said I wanted to kill someone I meant the enemy.’\n Tiste Edur.’\n ‘Letherii bandits will do-there must be bandits around here somewhere.’\n ‘Why?’\n ‘What do you mean, why? There’s always bandits in the countryside, Bottle. Led by moustached rogues with fancy names. Zorala Snicker, or Pamby Doughty-’ \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-220.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: \n All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
