He’ll not even look at the Emperor, until Rhulad draws closer, until the two of them begin.\n Not overconfident. Not indifferent. Not even contemptuous. No easy explanations for this Toblakai warrior. He would be within himself, entirely within himself, until it was time… to witness.\n But nothing would turn out right, Samar Dev knew. Not all of Karsa Orlong’s prowess, nor that ever-flooding, ever-cascading torrent that was the Toblakai’s will; nor even this host of spirits trapped in the knife she now held, and those others who trailed the Toblakai’s shadow-souls of the slain, desert godlings and ancient demons of the sands and rock-spirits that might well burst forth, enwreathing their champion god (and was he truly that? A god? She did not know) with all their power. No, none of it would matter in the end.\n Kill Rhulad Sengar. Kill him thrice. Kill him a dozen times. In the end he will stand, sword bloodied, and then will come lcarium, the very last.\n To begin it all again.\n Karsa Orlong, reduced to a mere name among the list of the slain. Nothing more than that. For this extraordinary warrior. And this is what you whisper, Fallen One, as your holy credo. Grandness and potential and promise, they all break in the end.\n Even your great champion, this terrible, tortured Tiste Edur-you see him broken again and again. You fling him back each time less than what he was, yet with ever more power in his hands. He is there, yes, for us all. The power and its broken wielder broken by his power.\n Karsa Orlong sat up. ‘Someone has left,’ he said.\n Samar Dev blinked. ‘What?’\n He bared his teeth. ‘lcarium. He is gone.’\n ‘What do you mean, gone? He’s left? To go where?’\n ‘It does not matter,’ the Toblakai replied, swinging round to settle his feet on the floor. He stared across at her. ‘He knows.’\n ‘Knows what, Karsa Orlong?’\n The warrior stood, his smile broadening, twisting the crazed tattoos on his face. ‘That he will not be needed.’\n ‘Karsa-’\n ‘You will know when, woman. You will know.’\n Know what, damn you? ‘They wouldn’t have just let him go,’ she said. ‘So he must have taken down all the guards. Karsa, this is our last chance. To head out into the city. Leave all this-’\n ‘You do not understand. The Emperor is nothing. The Emperor, Samar Dev, is not the one he wants.’\n Who? Icarium? No-‘Karsa Orlong, what secret do you hold? What do you know about the Crippled God?’\n The Toblakai rose. ‘It is nearly dawn,’ he said. ‘Nearly time.’\n ‘Karsa, please-’\n ‘Will you witness?’\n ‘Do I have to?’\n He studied her for a moment, and then his next words shocked her to the core of her soul: ‘I need you, woman.’\n Why?’ she demanded, suddenly close to tears.\n ‘To witness. To do what needs doing when the time comes.’ He drew a deep, satisfied breath, looking away, his chest swelling until she thought his ribs would creak. ‘I live for days like these,’ he said.\n And now she did weep.\n Grandness, promise, potential. Fallen One, must you so share out your pain?\n ‘Women always get weak once a month, don’t they?’\n ‘Go to Hood, bastard.’\n ‘And quick to anger, too.’\n She was on her feet. Pounding a fist into his solid chest.\n Five times, six-he caught her wrist, not hard enough to hurt, but stopping those swings as if a manacle had snapped tight.\n She glared up at him.\n And he was, for his sake, not smiling.\n Her fist opened and she found herself almost physically pulled up and into his eyes-seeing them, it seemed, for the first time. Their immeasurable depth, their bright ferocity and joy.\n Karsa Orlong nodded. ‘Better, Samar Dev.’\n ‘You patronizing shit.’\n He released her arm. ‘I learn more each day about women. Because of you.’\n ‘You still have a lot to learn, Karsa Orlong,’ she said, turning away and wiping at her cheeks.\n ‘Yes, and that is a journey I will enjoy.’\n ‘I really should hate you,’ she said. ‘I’m sure most people who meet you hate you, eventually.’\n The Toblakai snorted. ‘The Emperor will.’\n ‘So now I must walk with you. Now I must watch you die.’\n From outside there came shouts.\n ‘They have discovered the escape,’ Karsa Orlong said, collecting his sword. ‘Soon they will come for us. Are you ready, Samar Dev?’ \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-439.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: \n All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
