I almost remember what you did.’ She drew out her flask and drank down a mouthful. ‘So be careful, Urb. Now, everybody who loosed quarrels go find them and that means all of them!’ She looked back down at the two dead Edur by the entrance.\\n\\n ‘Think we’re the first to draw blood?’ Tavos Pond asked, crouching to clean the blade of his sword on the cloak of the older Edur.\\n\\n ‘Big fat war, Tavos Pond. That’s what we got ourselves here.’\\n\\n ‘They weren’t so hard, Sergeant.’\\n\\n ‘Wasn’t expecting nothing either, were they? You think we can just ambush our way all the way to Letheras? Think again.’ She drank a couple more mouthfuls, then sighed and glowered over at Urb. ‘How soon before they’re the ones doing the ambushin’? That’s why I mean for us to ride-we’re gonna stay ahead of the bad news ‘s long as we can. That way we can be the bad news, right? The way it’s s’posed t’be.’\\n\\n Corporal Reem walked up to Urb. ‘Sergeant, we got us twelve horses.’\\n\\n ‘So we get one each,’ Hellian said. ‘Perfect.’\\n\\n ‘By my count,’ said Reem with narrowed eyes, ‘someone’s going to have to ride double.’\\n\\n ‘If you say so. Now, let’s get these bodies dragged away-they got any coin? Anybody checked?’\\n\\n ‘Some,’ said Maybe. ‘But mostly just polished stones.’\\n\\n ‘Polished stones?’\\n\\n ‘First I thought slingstones, but none of them’s carrying slings. So, aye, Sergeant. Polished stones.’\\n\\n Hellian turned away as the soldiers set off to dispose of the Edur corpses. Oponn’s pull, finding this keep, and finding nobody in it but one freshly dead Letherii in the hallway. Place had been cleaned out, although there’d been some foodstocks in the cold-rooms. Not a drop of wine or ale, the final proof, as far as she was concerned, that this foreign empire was a mess and useless besides and pretty much worth destroying down to its very last brick.\\n\\n Too bad they weren’t going to get a chance to do so.\\n\\n But then, it does a body good to misunderstand orders on occasion. So, let’s go hunting Edur heads, Hellian faced the courtyard again. Damn this darkness. Easy enough for the mages, maybe. And these grey-shins. ‘Urb,’ she said in a low voice.\\n\\n He edged closer, warily. ‘Hellian?’\\n\\n ‘We need us to arrange our ambushes for dusk and dawn.’\\n\\n ‘Aye. You’re right. You know, I’m glad our squads were paired up.’\\n\\n ‘Of course you are. You unnerstand me, Urb. You’re the only one who does, you know.’ She wiped her nose with the back of one hand. ‘It’s a sad thing, Urb. A sad thing.’\\n\\n ‘What? Killing these Tiste Edur?’\\n\\n She blinked at him. ‘No, you oaf. The fact that nobody else unnerstands me.’\\n\\n ‘Aye, Hellian. Tragic’\\n\\n ‘That’s what Banaschar always said to me, no matter what I was talking about. He’d just look at me, like you did there, and say tragic. So what’s all that about?’ She shook the flask-still half full, but another mouthful means I’m running it down, so’s I’ll need to top it up. Gotta be measured about these things, in case something terrible happens and I can’t get a fast refill. ‘Come on, it’s time to ride.’\\n\\n And if we run into a troop of Letherii?’\\n\\n Hellian frowned. ‘Then we do as Keneb told us. We talk to ‘em.’\\n\\n And if they don’t like what we say?’\\n\\n ‘Then we kill ‘em, of course.’\\n\\n And we’re riding for Letheras?’\\n\\n She smiled at Urb. Then tapped the side of her slightly numb head with one finger. ‘I memmored th’map-ized, memmized the map. There’s towns, Urb. An’ the closer we get t’Letheras, the more of them. Wha’s in towns, Urb? Taverns. Bars. So, we’re not takin’ a straight, pre-dic-table route.’\\n\\n ‘We’re invading Lether from tavern to tavern?’\\n\\n Aye/\\n\\n ‘Hellian, I hate to say this, but that’s kind of clever.’\\n\\n Aye. And that way we can eat real cooked food, too. It’s the civilized way of conductin’ war. Hellian’s way.’\\n\\n The bodies joined the lone Letherii in the latrine pit. Half naked, stripped of valuables, they were dumped down into the thick, turgid slop, which proved deeper than anyone had expected, as it swallowed up those corpses, leaving not a trace. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-224.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
