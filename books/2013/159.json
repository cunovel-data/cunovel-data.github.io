What I’m supposed to be like.’\n ‘You once told me you did not compel, you did not bind. You bargained.’\n ‘Ah, that. Well, yes, given the choice. Seems that being in your company crushes under heel the privilege of choice, Toblakai.’\n ‘You blame me for your greed?’\n ‘Not greed. More like an overwhelming need for power.’\n ,’To oppose me?’\n ‘You? No, I don’t think so. To stay alive, I think. You are dangerous, Karsa Orlong. Your will, your strength, your… disregard. You present the quaint and appalling argument that through wilful ignorance of the laws and rules of the universe you cannot suffer their influence. As you might imagine, your very success poses evidence of that tenet, and it is one I cannot reconcile, since it runs contrary to a lifetime of observation.’\n ‘Too many words again, Samar Dev. State it plain.’\n ‘Fine,’ she snapped. ‘Everything about you terrifies me.’\n He nodded. ‘And fascinates as well.’\n ‘Arrogant bastard. Believe what you like!’\n He turned back to the doorway. Collecting his sword, he said over one shoulder, ‘The Seguleh has unsheathed her swords for me, witch.’\n Then he was gone.\n Samar Dev remained on her cot for another dozen heartbeats, then, ‘Damn him!’ And she rose, hurrying to arrive before the bout began. Damn him!\n The sun had crawled far enough to one side of the sky to leave the compound in shadow. As she emerged from the covered colonnade Samar Dev saw the Seguleh standing in the middle of the exercise area, a thin-bladed longsword in each gloved hand. Her dark hair hung in greasy strands down her shoulders, and through the eye-holes of the mask her midnight gaze tracked Karsa Orlong as he strode to join her in the sand-floored clearing.\n A full score of champions looked on, indicating that word had travelled, and Samar Dev saw-with shock-the Gral, Taralack Veed, and, behind him, Icarium. Gods below, the name, the Jhag… all that I know, all that 1 have heard. Icarium is here. A champion.\n He will leave this city a heap of rubble. He will leave its citizens a mountain of shattered bones. Gods, look at him! Standing calm, so deep in shadow as to be almost invisible-Karsa does not see him, no. The Toblakai’s focus rests on the Seguleh, as he circles her at a distance. And she moves like a cat to ever face him.\n Oh, she is a fighter all right.\n And Karsa will throw her over the damned wall.\n If she dares close. As she must. Get inside that huge flint sword.\n Over the wall. Or through it.\n Her heart pounded, the beat rapid, disturbingly erratic.\n She sensed someone at her side and saw, with a jolt of alarm, a Tiste Edur-and she then recognized him. Preda… Tomad. Tomad Sengar.\n The Emperor’s father.\n Karsa, you don’t want this audience-\n An explosion of motion as the two contestants closed-afterwards, none could agree on who moved first, as if some instinctive agreement was reached between the Seguleh and Karsa, and acted upon faster than thought itself.\n And, as iron rang on stone-or stone on iron-Karsa Orlong did something unexpected.\n Pounded down with one foot. Hard onto the packed sand.\n In the midst of the Seguleh’s lithe dance.\n Pounded down, hard enough to stagger onlookers as the entire compound floor thundered.\n The Seguleh’s perfect balance… vanished.\n No doubt it was but a fraction, the dislodging so minor few would even register it, and no doubt her recovery was as instantaneous-but she was already reeling back to a savage blow with the flat of Karsa’s blade, both wrists broken by the impact.\n Yet, as she toppled, she twisted, one foot lashing upward towards the Toblakai’s crotch.\n He caught her kick with one hand, blocking the blow, then boldly lifted her into the air.\n She swung the other foot.\n And the Toblakai, laughing, released his sword and snagged that leg as well.\n And held her there.\n Dangling.\n Behind Taralack Veed, there was a soft sigh, and the Gral, blinking, turned round.\n Icarium smiled. Then said in a low voice, ‘We have met, I think. He and I. Perhaps long ago. A duel that was interrupted.’\n By Mappo. Has to be. Mappo, who saw a storm coming between these two. Oh, Trell…\n Taralack licked dry lips. ‘Would you resume that duel, Icarium?’\n The Jhag’s brows lifted fractionally. Then he shook his head, leaving that as his answer. Thank the spirits.\n From Preda Tomad Sengar, a grunt. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-159.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: \n All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
