And, Seren Pedac, you are not welcome there.’ He pushed himself upright. ‘You have been warned.’ Then he looked up, one hand settling on Kettle’s shoulder. His eyes, suddenly bright, avid, scanned Seren, Fear, and then moved up the trail, to where Silchas Ruin and Clip now stood side by side, regarding those downslope. ‘Here’s a most telling question-the kind few dare utter, by the way. Which one among us, friends, is not haunted by a death wish? Perhaps we ought to discuss mutual suicide…’\\n\\n No-one spoke for a half-dozen heartbeats. Until Kettle said, ‘I don’t want to die!’\\n\\n Seren saw the ex-slave’s bitter smile crumble, a sudden collapse into undeniable grief, before he turned away.\\n\\n ‘Trull was blind to his own truth,’ Fear said to her in a quiet voice. ‘I was there, Acquitor. I know what I saw.’\\n\\n She refused to meet his eyes. Expedience. How could such a warrior proclaim his love for me? How could he even believe he knew me enough for that?\\n\\n And why can I see his face as clear in my mind as if he stood here before me? 1 am haunted indeed. Oh, Udinaas, you were right. Fear is an honourable man, so honourable as to break all our hearts.\\n\\n But, Fear, there is no value in honouring one who is dead.\\n\\n ‘Trull is dead,’ she said, stunning herself with her own brutality as she saw Fear visibly flinch. ‘He is dead.’ And so am I. There is no point in honouring the dead. I have seen too much to believe otherwise. Grieve for lost potential, the end of possibilities, the eternally silent demise of promise. Grieve for that, Fear Sengar, and you will understand, finally, how grief is but a mirror, held close to one’s own face.\\n\\n And every tear springs from the choices we ourselves did not make.\\n\\n When 1 grieve, Fear, I cannot even see the bloom of my own breath-what does that tell you?\\n\\n They resumed walking. Silent.\\n\\n A hundred paces above the group, Clip spun his chain and rings. ‘What was all that about?’ he asked.\\n\\n ‘You have lived in your tidy cave for too long,’ the white-skinned Tiste Andii said.\\n\\n ‘Oh, I get out often enough. Carousing in Bluerose-the gods know how many bastards have been brewed by my seed. Why-’\\n\\n ‘One day, Mortal Sword,’ Silchas Ruin interrupted, ‘you will discover what cuts deeper than any weapon of iron.’\\n\\n ‘Wise words from the one who smells still of barrows and rotting cobwebs.’\\n\\n ‘If the dead could speak, Clip, what would they tell you?’\\n\\n ‘Little, I expect, beyond complaints about this and that.’\\n\\n ‘Perhaps, then, that is all you deserve.’\\n\\n ‘Oh, I lack honour, do I?’\\n\\n ‘I am not sure what you lack,’ Silchas Ruin replied, ‘but I am certain I will comprehend before we are done.’\\n\\n Rings and chain snapped taut. ‘Here they come. Shall we continue onward and upward?’\\n\\n There was so much that Toe the Younger-Anaster, Firstborn of the Dead Seed, the Thrice-blinded, Chosen by the Wolf Gods, the Unlucky-did not wish to remember.\\n\\n His other body for one; the body he had been born into, the first home to his soul. Detonations against Moon’s Spawn above the doomed city of Pale, fire and searing, blazing heat-oh, don’t stand there. Then that damned puppet, Hairlock, delivering oblivion, wherein his soul had found a rider, another force-a wolf, one-eyed and grieving.\\n\\n How the Pannion Seer had lusted for its death. Toc recalled the cage, that spiritual prison, and the torment as his body was broken, healed, then broken yet again, a procession seemingly without end. But these memories and pain and anguish persisted as little more than abstract notions. Yet, mangled and twisted as that body had been, at least it was mine.\\n\\n Strip away years, course sudden in new blood, feel these strange limbs so vulnerable to cold. To awaken in another’s flesh, to start against muscle memories, to struggle with those that were suddenly gone. Toc wondered if any other mortal soul had ever before staggered this tortured path. Stone and fire had marked him, as Tool once told him. To lose an eye delivers the gift of preternatural sight. And what of leaving a used-up body for a younger, healthier one? Surely a gift-so the wolves desired, or was it Silverfox?\\n\\n But wait. A closer look at this Anaster-who lost an eye, was given a new one, then lost it yet again. Whose mind-before it was broken and flung away-was twisted with terror, haunted by a mother’s terrible love; who had lived the life of a tyrant among cannibals-oh yes, look closely at these limbs, the muscles beneath, and remember-this body has grown with the eating of human flesh. And this mouth, so eager with its words, it has tasted the succulent juices of its kin-remember that? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-144.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
