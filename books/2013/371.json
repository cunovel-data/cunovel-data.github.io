Did you know he’s saving himself for a woman of royal blood?’\n ‘That’s not what the men inclined that way are saying.’\n ‘Where’d you hear that?’\n ‘Besides, you’re hardly royal blood, Smiles. Queen of shell-shuckers won’t cut it.’\n ‘That’s why I need you to lie for me. I was a Kanese princess-sent into the Malazan Army to keep the Claw from finding me-’\n ‘Oh, for Hood’s sake!’\n ‘Shh! Listen, the rest in the squad said they’d be happy to lie for me. What’s wrong with you?’\n ‘Happy… ha, that’s good. Very good.’ He then turned to study her. ‘You’re eager for Skulldeath to take one of those flying leaps straight between your legs? You want to get pregnant with some prince from some Seven Cities flying squirrel tribe?’\n ‘Pregnant? Aye, when dolphins walk and fish nest in trees. I won’t get pregnant,’ she pronounced. ‘Bottle’s giving me some herbs to take care of that. My beloved Skulldeath can empty gallons of his seed into me for Hood-damned ever and there won’t be any little jackrabbits jumping round.’;\n ‘He’s got the face of a girl,’ Koryk said. ‘And the men say he kisses like one, too.’\n ‘Who’s telling you all this?’\n ‘Saving his seed, that’s a laugh.’\n ‘Listen, those men, they don’t mean nothing. Now, am I a Kanese princess or not?’\n ‘Oh, aye. Rival to the empire’s throne, in fact. Be the fly-ing fish to the flying squirrel and make your nest in some tree, Smiles. When all’s done what’s needed doing.’\n She surprised him with a bright smile. ‘Thanks, Koryk. You’re a true friend.’\n He stared after her as she hurried off. Poor lass. The squirrel’s saving his seed because he doesn’t know what to do with it, is my guess.\n A figure walked past in the gloom and Koryk squinted until he recognized the man’s gait. ‘Hey, Bottle.’\n The young mage halted, looked over, then, feet dragging, approached.\n Koryk said, ‘You’re supposed to be asleep.’\n ‘Thanks.’\n ‘So you’re giving Smiles special herbs, are you. Why do you-’\n ‘I’m what?’\n ‘Herbs. So she won’t get pregnant.’\n ‘Look, if she doesn’t want to get pregnant, she should just stop straddling every-’\n ‘Hold on, Bottle! Wait. I thought she’d talked to you. About herbs which you promised to give her-’\n ‘Oh, those herbs. No, you got it all wrong, Koryk. Those aren’t to keep her from getting pregnant. In fact, it’s some concoction of my grandmother’s and I’ve no idea if it even works, but anyway, it’s got nothing to do with not getting pregnant. Why, if she’d asked me about that kind of stuff, sure, there’s some very reliable-’\n ‘Stop! What-what does this concoction you’re giving her do to her, then?’\n ‘She’d better not be taking it! It’s for a man-’\n ‘For Skulldeath?’\n ‘Skulldeath? What…’ Bottle stared down for a long moment. ‘Do you know what skulldeath is, Koryk? It’s a plant that grows on Malaz Island and maybe Geni, too. You see, normally there’s male plants and there’s female plants and that’s how you get fruit and the like, right? Anyway, not so with the sweet little skulldeath. There’s only males-no females at all. Skulldeaths loose their-well, they spill it all out into the air, and it ends up somehow getting into the seeds of other plants and just riding along, hiding, until that seed sprouts, then it takes over and suddenly, another nice skulldeath with that grey flower that’s not really a flower at all, just a thin sack filled with-’\n ‘So, that concoction Smiles asked for-what does it do?’\n ‘Supposed to change a man who prefers other men into one who prefers women. Does it work? I have no idea.’\n ‘Skulldeath may be a plant,’ Koryk said, ‘but it’s also the name for a soldier in Primly’s squad. A pretty one.’\n ‘Oh, and that name…’\n ‘Is obviously very appropriate, Bottle.’\n ‘Oh. Poor Smiles.’\n The Factor’s house might have looked nice, but it might as well have been made of straw, the way it fell down. Astonishing that no-one had died beneath all that wreckage. Urb at the least was certainly relieved by that, though his mood wilted somewhat after Hellian was through yelling at him. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-371.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: \n All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
