And you, as well.’\\n\\n ‘Why is that?’\\n\\n The mage named Widdershins spoke up, ‘Those refugees of hers, Adjunct. One big squall of witches and warlocks. Oh, squiggily stuff for the most part-fouling water and cursin’ us with the runs and boils and the like. Mind, they could get together and work nastier rituals…’\\n\\n Shurq Elalle stared at the strange man. Squiggily?\\n\\n ‘Yes,’ said Yan Tovis. ‘They could become troublesome.’\\n\\n Gait grunted. ‘So saving all their lives don’t count for nothing?’\\n\\n ‘It does, of course. But, like all things, even gratitude wanes in time, soldier. Especially when the deed hangs over us like an executioner’s axe.’\\n\\n Gait’s scowl deepened, then he prodded Yedan Derryg with his sword. ‘I need to keep this here?’ he asked.\\n\\n The bearded, helmed soldier seemed to chew on his reply before answering, ‘That is for my Queen to decide.’\\n\\n ‘Belay my last order,’ Yan Tovis said. ‘We can deal with Brullyg later.’\\n\\n ‘Like demon-spawn you will!’ Brullyg drew himself up. Adjunct Tavore Paran, I hereby seek your protection. Since I have co-operated with you from the very start, the least you can do is keep me alive. Sail me to the mainland if that suits. I don’t care where I end up-just not in that woman’s clutches.’\\n\\n Shurq Elalle smiled at the fool. Only everything you don’t deserve, Brullyg. Mercy? In the Errant’s fart, that’s where you’ll find that.\\n\\n Tavore’s voice was suddenly cold. ‘Shake Brullyg, your assistance is duly noted, and you have our gratitude, although I do seem to recall something about this island’s imminent destruction beneath a sea of ice-which we prevented and continue to prevent. It may please the Queen that we do not intend to remain here much longer.’\\n\\n Brullyg paled. ‘But what about that ice?’ he demanded. ‘If you leave-’\\n\\n ‘As the season warms,’ Tavore said, ‘the threat diminishes. Literally.’\\n\\n ‘So what holds you here?’ Yan Tovis demanded.\\n\\n ‘We seek a pilot to the Lether River. And Letheras.’\\n\\n Silence again. Shurq Elalle, who had been gleefully observing Brullyg’s emotional dissolution, slowly frowned. Then looked round. All eyes were fixed on her. What had the Adjunct just said? Oh. The Lether River and Letheras.\\n\\n And a pilot to guide their invasion fleet.\\n\\n ‘What’s that smell?’ Widdershins suddenly asked.\\n\\n Shurq scowled. ‘The Errant’s fart, is my guess.’\\n\\n Chapter Eighteen\\n\\n The view thus accorded was a vista to answer my last day in the mortal world. The march down of hewn stones, menhirs and rygoliths showed in these unrelieved shadows the array of stolid faces, the underworld grimaces and hisses, bared teeth to threaten, the infinite rows of rooted gods and spirits stretching down the slope, across hill after hill, all the way, yes, to the limitless beyond sight, beyond the mirror of these misshapen, squinting eyes. And in these stalwart belligerents, who each in their day of eminence reached out clawed, grasping hands, the crimson touch of faith in all its demands on our time, our lives, our loves and our fears, were naught but mystery now, all recognition forgotten, abandoned to the crawl of remorseless change. Did their lost voices ride this forlorn wind? Did I tremble to the echo of blood beseechings, the tearing of young virgin flesh and the worider of an exposed heart, the bemused last beats of insistent outrage? Did I fall to my knees before this ghastly succession of holy tyranny, as might any-ignorant cowerer in crowded shadows?\\n\\n The armies of the faithful were gone. They marched away in lifted waves of dust and ash. Priests and priestesses, the succumbers to hope who conveyed their convictions with the desperate thirst of demons hoarding fearful souls in their private meanings of wealth, they remained couched in the cracks of their idols, bits of crumbling bone lodged in the stone’s weaknesses, that and nothing more.\\n\\n The view thus accorded, is the historian’s curse. Lessons endless on the pointlessness of games of intellect, emotion and faith.\\n\\n The only worthwhile historians, I say, are those who conclude their lives in succinct acts of suicide.\\n\\n – Sixth Note, Volume 11, Collected Suicide Notes , Historian Brevos (the Indecisive)\\n\\n His mother had loved his hands. A musician’s hands. A sculptor’s hands. An artist’s hands. Alas, they had belonged on someone else, for Chancellor Triban Gnol was without such talents. Yet his fondness for his hands, tainted as it might be by the mockery of a physical gift without suitable expression, had grown over the years. They had, in a sense, become his own works of art. When lost in thought, he would watch them, their sinuous movements filled with grace and elegance. No artist could capture the true beauty of these pointless instruments, and although there was darkness to such appreciation, he had long since made peace with that. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-295.html","bookId":2013,"book":{"id":2013,"title":"Reaper\u0027s Gale (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #7)","description":"Storyline: All is not well in the Letherii Empire. Rhulad Sengar, the Emperor of a Thousand Deaths, spirals into madness, surrounded by sycophants and agents of his Machiavellian chancellor, while the Letherii secret police conduct a campaign of terror against its own people. The Errant, once a farseeing god, is suddenly blind to the future. Conspiracies seethe throughout the palace, as the empire - driven by the corrupt and self-interested - edges ever-closer to all-out war with the neighbouring kingdoms. And the great Edur fleet - its warriors selected from countless peoples - draws ever closer. Amongst them are Karsa Orlong and Icarium Lifestealer - each destined to cross blades with the emperor himself. That yet more blood is to be spilled is inevitable... Against this backdrop, a band of fugitives seek a way out of the empire, but one of them, Fear Sengar must find the soul of Scabandari Bloodeye. It is his hope that it might help halt the Tiste Edur, and so save his brother, the emperor. Yet, travelling with them is Scabandari\u0027s most ancient foe: Silchas Ruin, brother of Anomander Rake. And his motives are anything but certain - for the wounds he carries on his back, made by the blades of Scabandari, are still fresh. Fate decrees that there is to be a reckoning, for such bloodshed cannot go unanswered - and it will be a reckoning on an unimaginable scale... \\n A brutal, harrowing novel of war, intrigue and dark, uncontrollable magic, this is epic fantasy at its most imaginative, storytelling at its most thrilling.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:14 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:21 PM"}}
