{"id":8932,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XI","content":"When Cicely Winslow was parted from her cousin she went at once to seek a lodging in the house of Master Thomas Lane, one of the most flourishing wool-merchants of Taunton. For many years the Winslows had purchased their stuffs from the house of Lane, in fact ever since the time when the founder after a long and devoted service at the Manor House had established himself in business at Taunton. Therefore, when Cicely presented herself at the house of the worthy merchant she met with a hearty though respectful welcome, and felt confident of all possible assistance. But though comforted by the warmth of her welcome, Cicely was not slow to perceive that while the long business connection betwixt the two families assured to her every consideration and respect, yet the political opinions of her family met with anything but approval from her host. For, indeed, the Lanes, unlike the majority of the townsfolk of Taunton, were the staunchest of Tories. They had ever stood firm for the King, and having suffered considerably for their opinions during Monmouth\u0027s brief reign of power in the West, it was perhaps but natural that now they should feel harshly disposed towards those who had favoured the Duke in his rebellion against their lawful sovereign. The household was about to sit down to supper when Cicely arrived, but they waited respectfully until she was ready to join them in the large lofty room, where, according to the fashion of the day, it was the custom for master and family to sup in company with the apprentices and others forming the household. Knowing well the differences of opinion which existed between themselves and their guest, Master Lane and his good wife endeavoured to avoid all reference to current events, but the all-pervading topic would not be stayed from creeping into the conversation, and so at length Master Lane deemed it best boldly to set their relations on a more definite and clear footing. \"You are heartily welcome, Lady Cicely,\" he began gravely, \"and I will gladly render you what help I can; at the same time I cannot disguise from you, indeed it were not right to do so, how heartily I disapprove of the step young Sir Rupert has taken. So much opposed to what I am sure his father would have wished. Sir Rupert in thus wilfully aiding rebellion against his lawful sovereign has proved himself unworthy of his noble name, and of the high and honourable position he should hold in the country.\" Cicely\u0027s eyes filled with tears at this unexpected attack. She had not Barbara\u0027s spirit, and could not enter into eager discussion with her sedate and solemn host, as her cousin would doubtless have done under similar circumstances. She had no full knowledge of the questions which stirred men\u0027s hearts at the time, only to her, what Rupert did was right, and now in her loneliness it tried her sadly to hear his actions thus ruthlessly condemned, and that, moreover, by one whose opinions she could not but respect. But the good merchant was quite oblivious to her distress. He knew nothing of the close relations between her and Sir Rupert, and was intent only upon removing any misapprehension on her part as to what were his real feelings, while at the same time he deeply pitied the misfortunes which had overtaken the family with which he had been long honourably associated. \"The late Duke of Monmouth,\" he continued solemnly, \"set foot in this realm in open rebellion; not only so, but he and those under him deliberately invented and spread abroad scandal concerning the religion, the honourable intentions, and the virtue of our noble sovereign. Moreover, he had the effrontery actually to declare himself, here at Taunton, lawful King of Britain, thereby seeking to depose his own uncle. Furthermore, he hath since proved himself coward, not alone by his conduct upon the field of Sedgemoor, but also by the manner of his meeting death. That men should be so ready to turn from allegiance to their king, to support the claims of such an one, so worthless and so base, betrays a condition of mind unstable and untrustworthy. For howsoever they may choose to prate of religion and justice, they show but shallow reasoning. For religion and justice are protected by our lord, the King, and need no other defender, and the alleged dangers threatening the Protestant Church are but the inventions of fools. \u0027Tis no regard for religion and justice which directs such men, but a love of excitement or a hope to escape from patient, honest toil by a chance turn of events in the fortune of war.\" Here he cast a severe glance down the table in the direction of his apprentices. \"For Mistress Barbara,\" he continued, \"I will, if only for her honoured father\u0027s sake, do what I can, and I have small fear but that all severe punishment may be averted. But a woman hath no reason to interfere in such affairs, and she must not be surprised if she meet her reward. I rejoice, for his sake, that Sir Rupert hath escaped, and pray that his misfortunes and hardships may tame his hot blood. \u0027Tis indeed a sad business.\" So the old man droned on solemnly, his wife from time to time nodding approval, till Cicely choked over her meat, and felt she could endure no more, but must scream aloud to stop this dreary tirade, every word of which was a sword-thrust in her over-wrought heart. But diversion came from an unexpected quarter. Among the apprentices at the lower end of the table sat a broad-shouldered, long-legged youth, whose sharp, eager face was surmounted by a shock of fiery red hair. Throughout this discourse he had evinced the utmost restlessness, shaking his head, clenching his fists, half-rising from his seat, and showing all the signs of entire dissension from the speaker. At length he could restrain himself no longer, but bidding defiance to all custom and etiquette at his master\u0027s table, he leaned forward eagerly and broke into the conversation. \"An it please you, sir, \u0027tis not so, and I must speak,\" he exclaimed desperately. \"\u0027Tis unjust to talk thus of those who fought for Monmouth, unjust and untrue. We—they—\u0027twas not a search merely for excitement; \u0027twas not for evasion of lawful duties, but was to uphold the sacred cause of justice; \u0027tis—\u0027tis a slander to say else. Indeed, sir, would men risk their lives, their homes, for a jest? Would they fight, as the Duke\u0027s men fought, for a mere whimsey? \u0027Tis false to say they had no reason, nor grievance. When religion is endangered and when justice is o\u0027erthrown men have grievance enow! You urge the King\u0027s justice,\" he continued with scorn. \"We hear enow of the King\u0027s justice in these times from Exeter or from Dorchester. We shall watch it this week in Taunton an I mistake not. But for the Duke\u0027s men, \u0027tis unfair to speak of them as though they had been a band of rowdies. They were true men, gallant men, and I would I had been among them.\" He stopped as suddenly as he had begun, crimsoned to the roots of his flaming hair, and glanced around him with a look of dogged recklessness, as of one who had said his say and cared nothing for what should befall him. There had been a sudden astonished silence, all eyes fixed upon the lad who had dared thus to beard Master Lane at his own table. The elders regarded him with horror, the younger apprentices with awe not untouched with a certain admiration. For Master Robert Wilcox\u0027s opinions were well known. It was also well known that he had intended to join the rebel army had he not been forcibly detained by his godfather, Master Lane, who at the first sign of rebellion had packed the fiery lad off to Portsmouth, where he had remained safe under the sharp eye of his uncle, a retired shipmaster, till the danger had passed. But despite the fact that Master Robert was a somewhat privileged person and, notwithstanding his turbulent spirit, a favourite with his godfather, that he should have dared to enter into public discussion with his master, and upon such a subject, passed the bounds of previous belief. All held their breath in expectation of the sharp reprimand which they knew must follow, and which was, indeed, hovering on Master Lane\u0027s lips, when he was once again interrupted, this time by a member of his own family, a traitor, so it seemed to him, on his very hearth. The Lanes had two daughters. The elder, Deborah, was the image of her mother, a solemn, staid, and eminently practical maiden, not, indeed, without a certain love of excitement, but yet in most points a typical burgher maid. Of the younger girl, Prudence, \u0027twas a matter of constant wonder how such a madcap could spring from a family so grave, so unemotional, as were the Lanes. Pretty, spoiled, saucy, mischievous, she was the delight of her father; adventurous and romantic to a degree, she was the plague of her mother; and in every respect she was a constant alarm and puzzle to her duller-witted sister Deborah. Now she chose to electrify her family by taking up the theme where Master Wilcox had left it. First casting a bright, approving glance in his direction, which caused that ardent youth to blush more crimson than before, she proceeded to expound her views upon the subject with a directness that amused the apprentices mightily and horrified her mother and sister. \"Rob is right, dad. \u0027Tis mighty unfair to speak thus of the Duke\u0027s men because they fell into the Bussex Rhine instead of winning the victory. For all the world knows they had won if—if they had not been defeated. For my part, I am for the Duke and for all who rode with him. And I think \u0027twas splendid of Sir Rupert,\" she added, with a bright glance at Lady Cicely, who could not resist a grateful smile in return, at her saucy defender. Mistress Lane frowned sharply, but the merchant only shook his head indulgently at his spoiled daughter. \"What! here is a traitor indeed. Has my little Prue turned political?\" \"Nay, dad, I care naught for politics, I only say \u0027tis finer to risk life and fortune and all for—for principles, whatever they be, than to sit year in and year out among ledgers and wool bales and to care nothing for country and church, but think only how to keep a whole skin and get money enow to live at ease and grow fat. \u0027Tis contemptible. Nay, daddie, I meant not you,\" she added penitently. \"You have fought, I know well. I spake but of younger men who had as lief see their country go to rack and ruin as risk a crown of their wealth or a scratch to their finger to set it to rights.\" She paused out of breath with her torrent of indignation. Her father laid his hand on hers tenderly and shook his head gravely at her words. \"Nay, Prudence, Robert, children both, you know nought of the matter. Perchance I spake unkindly of the rebels. I would not be unjust. But I am growing an old man, I have passed through one civil war, and I pray Heaven night and day that England may never see another. Had you been living as was I through those terrible years, had you seen the country devastated, families divided, brother against brother, aye, father even drawing sword upon his own son; homes ruined, wives widowed, children left fatherless through the whole length and breadth of the land—had you seen these things, my children, you would understand better why I speak thus harshly of those who raise the standard of rebellion within our fair realm. Men may use all just, all peaceful means of redressing their grievances, but should they fail, then, I say, \u0027twere better to endure those grievances, aye, even injustice, in silence, than bring the curse of civil war upon their country.\" There was silence for a space. Then Prudence, whom no solemnity could long depress, again broke out merrily: \"For all that, daddie, the Duke\u0027s a main handsome man, and one worthy to be followed.\" \"Why, Prue?\" exclaimed her sister teasingly, \"methought you cared for none save brave men. How canst speak thus of such a proved coward?\" \"The Duke is no coward,\" exclaimed Prue hotly. \"They be but lying knaves who say otherwise. He is worthy to be followed and,\" with a saucy glance at her father, \"when he comes again I\u0027ll follow him myself.\" \"When he comes again!\" cried Deborah in blank astonishment. \"La! child, where be thy wits? Dost not know he was beheaded on Tower Hill, two months since?\" \"Aye, so they say in London,\" answered the little rebel scornfully. \"But what should they know on\u0027t there? Here in the West \u0027tis known that the Duke escaped, and that \u0027twas his servant, dressed in his coat, and as like him as pea to pea, whom the soldiers took. He died in his master\u0027s place as would many another, and the Duke will return again to venge himself upon this bloody King.\" Deborah stared in blank astonishment at the exposition of this astounding theory which, notwithstanding its extravagance, did not lack many believers other than the pretty Prudence. But Mistress Lane would endure no more, and interrupted her daughter sharply. \"Prudence, you give your tongue too much license, as I have told you oft. Go to your room and rest there till you be of a better mind. Nay, Thomas, \u0027tis for the child\u0027s own good; who can say what trouble may befall her if she will not curb that saucy spirit? To your room instantly, Prudence; three days with bread and water will tame you, let us hope, and let us hear no more of this nonsense.\" Prudence rose slowly with pouting lips, and cast glances of entreaty in the direction of her father, who resolutely refused, however, to meet the eyes of the daughter whom as he knew too well he spoiled. Robert Wilcox\u0027s countenance assumed terrible contortions in its endeavour to express at the same time admiration of Prue\u0027s bravery and indignation at Mistress Lane\u0027s severity, but he dared make no more outspoken remonstrance. Prue saw no escape and was leaving the room to go to her imprisonment when Cicely intervened. \"Prithee, Mistress Lane,\" she pleaded gently, \"forgive her. I make no doubt \u0027twas but consideration for me made her speak so rashly, she will be more careful hereafter. Nay, an you will forgive her, I will be her surety for the next three days that no word of folly pass her lips. You will grant me this, else shall I feel that I have brought dissension into your household, and that would grieve me indeed.\" She pleaded gently, but urgently, and Mistress Lane could not refuse so honoured a guest. So Prudence was forgiven, after receiving a lecture upon the virtue of silence in the presence of her elders. But so ardent were the looks of gratitude for her interference which Cicely received from the red-headed apprentice, that she learned at least one secret that evening, and intercepting a glance or two \u0027twixt him and the pretty Prudence, she suspected that she had learned yet another. The Lanes were an early household, and when Cicely rose in the morning, having slept late after her journey of the previous day, she found they had long been about their duties of the day. Nor had her affairs been forgotten. Master Lane had been early to the prison to ascertain of Mistress Barbara\u0027s comfort, but discovered, to his chagrin, that admission was strictly forbidden. He had next sought out the governor, hoping an exception might be made in favour of so staunch a Tory as himself, but the governor informed him, courteously enough, that such a favour was impossible. Hitherto a visit to the prisoners had been an easy matter to compass, but in consequence of the escape of some of the prisoners who accompanied the train of the chief justice on the road to Exeter, an order had been issued that no access should be allowed to the prisoners on any pretext whatever. The governor expressed his regret at being obliged to refuse the request, but he could make no exceptions. He consented, however, to convey a hamper of fruits and other dainties to Mistress Winslow, and promised to do all in his power to promote her comfort. So Master Lane was obliged to content himself by despatching a consignment of delicacies to relieve the ordinary prison fare, which, however, owing to the occupation of the governor, busy with a thousand prisoners on his hands, and the venality of gaolers, never reached its destination. It had been with a twinge of remorse that he had ascertained, amongst other details, that Barbara was confined in the very shed which he had himself lent to the government; still he had done his utmost to prove his interest in her cause and having brought Cicely news of his mission with a further promise to do what he could to influence the authorities in Barbara\u0027s behalf, he went to his work leaving her to pass the day as best she could. Long and wearisome were the hours to the tender heart of Cicely as she sat over Mistress Lane\u0027s tambour frame, seeking by such occupation to drive from her mind the ever rising fear of what the morrow might bring. Mistress Lane was busy about her household duties, Deborah helping her, but Prudence brought her work to the window-seat where Cicely had seated herself and soon her busy tongue broke through the thin veneer of shyness which she felt towards this lady, so beautiful, so unhappy, and in her eyes, so eminently interesting, and she was presently chattering busily, her work neglected on her lap. Her eagerness and admiration banished Cicely\u0027s reserve, poor Cicely, so anxious for sympathy, and Prudence had soon learned the whole story of the betrothal to Sir Rupert, of their last meeting, and of Barbara\u0027s daring escapade. Prudence was charmed. \u0027Twas so romantic, so venturesome, so brave. She listened eagerly to Cicely\u0027s description of her lover, of his reckless daring and his tenderness. With all the ready passion of an emotional nature she worshipped the heroine of so distressful a love-story and with the eagerness of a romantic child espoused her cause. Cicely was grateful for this ready sympathy and the mutual confidence thus inspired induced her companion to tell her story too. \"Yes—\u0027tis true, Robert saith he loves me, and though he be but a \u0027prentice, he is brave and—and splendid, and methinks I care for him also, though \u0027twould not do to let him know how dearly. He is not as the others. You marked him, perchance, at supper yester e\u0027en. How he spake his mind! He would be a soldier, an he had his way, he but bides here to please my father, and and——\" \"Perchance to see thee at times?\" questioned Cicely, smiling. \"It may be so,\" was the demure answer. \"But he will not be a wool-merchant all his days, Lady Cicely. He means to be a great man, perchance to be in the Parliament; think on\u0027t, to rule the kingdom, and he could do it well, though I would not tell him so. But, indeed, I care not what he be, so that he love me truly,\" she added na?vely. \"And what saith Master Lane to this?\" \"Oh, dad likes him well, I doubt not. But we have not thought fit to trouble him with the matter yet.\" Cicely shook her head, but could not find it in her heart to be severe with such an outspoken admirer of Rupert. She won Prue\u0027s heart more completely still by her kindly wishes for the future, and a few commendatory remarks concerning Master Wilcox\u0027s appearance, and the younger girl\u0027s tongue once loosened on the subject she chattered busily until they were joined by Mistress Lane, who cast a severe glance at her daughter\u0027s neglected work. The morning passed slowly away, but noon brought a visitor for Cicely in the person of Peter Drew, the smith. He had ridden that morning from Durford to offer his services to his ladies, and Cicely could not but rejoice to see his honest, friendly face, though she was conscious of the dangers of so sturdy a supporter of her family wandering unrestrained in the streets of Taunton, and doubtless speaking his mind to whomsoever he met. Indeed, a large bruise on his forehead and a certain dishevelled appearance about his garments, betokened that he had already met with a dissentient acquaintance. Cicely questioned him closely on the subject and he reluctantly confessed that such had indeed been the case. \"\u0027Twere but a mon at Inn where I left Black Beauty,\" he explained calmly. \"Muzt needs ask my biznez, which I told un, arl vair and pleazant. But a muzt needz zay \u0027twere waizer to keep fra mixing wi\u0027 rebels and zuch laike, zo I told un my lady were no rebel. And a zaying it appeared her were, I ga?ve un a tap on head to quiet un. But host and others, zo plaize your ladyship, coom at me thereupon wi\u0027 bezoms, whereat I knocked two flat, and others zhowing little ztomach to te?ste my cudgel, I oop on Black Beauty and rid awai. \u0027Twere but a mizunderztanding, zee, and none hurt, but a zhould laive an honest mon to do her biznez in pace.\" Though fain to laugh at the smith\u0027s bold narrative, Cicely saw clearly that she could not keep him in Taunton without hourly risk of the recurrence of such an episode. She therefore gently told him that, grateful though she was for his visit, he would yet serve her better by remaining quietly at Durford and helping Phoebe to look after the Manor House. And she prayed him return thither as speedily as possible, and remain there till she sent for his assistance. Peter was terribly disappointed. He shook his head, sighed, moved restlessly in his seat. Then he rose and made a slow tour of the room, peering cautiously behind every curtain and under every article of furniture, and having ascertained to his satisfaction that he and Cicely were alone, he approached her with an air of deep mystery, and exclaimed in a loud whisper: \"An\u0027t plaize your ladyship, carn\u0027t her ezca?pe.\" \"What, Peter!\" exclaimed Cicely, astonished. \"Beggin\u0027 your ladyzhip\u0027s pardon, but \u0027twere last naight at the Royal Ja?mes. A were there, a-talkin\u0027 o\u0027 Mistress Barbara i\u0027 gaol, and \u0027twere zaid, why couldn\u0027t her ezca?pe? If it be but a matter o\u0027 boltz and barz, I be a zmith by tra?de, and they be zoon broken. I would na interfere wi\u0027 king\u0027s justice i\u0027 the main, but vor Mistress Barbara, \u0027tiz but raight her be freed at once. And zo I be coom hither to do it.\" \"\u0027Twas very kind of you, Peter,\" answered Cicely, repressing a smile; \"but I fear it could not be done. You see there be sentinels guarding the prison. We could not elude them.\" Peter\u0027s face fell; he scratched his head for some moments in dubious silence. Suddenly he slapped his leg in delight. \"A boggart!\" he cried; \"a boggart. \u0027Tis the very thing. I mind wull my vayther tull me that when a were clapped i\u0027 gaol over te Cannington vor—vor zome matter of stalin\u0027 a pig, brother skeered gaoler wi\u0027 a boggart and a coom awai. Now an thee wull be a boggart and skeer t\u0027zentinels, I wull look to barz and boltz and Miztress Barbara will be vree by mud-naight.\" Cicely gasped. She pictured herself dressed as a ghost, hopping about the streets of Taunton, a terror to the soldiery, while Peter in the meanwhile broke patiently thro\u0027 the bars that shut in Barbara from freedom. She broke into hysterical laughter. Peter was crestfallen at this reception of his plan. \"I zim to think of nought elze,\" he muttered disconsolately. \"There be many weays o\u0027 ezca?pe, Miztress Barbara herzell a told me, could I but bring un to maind. There have been zome as pazzed vor prizoners to let un ezca?pe, but I could zcarce paz vor Mistress Barbara, and you, \u0027twere zmall good to vree her if your ladyship were left behaind. Then there be a ta?l o\u0027 a mon let down i\u0027 a bazket, but I zee not raightly how to do that. And there be birds wi\u0027 pa?pers under wings, and loaves o\u0027 bread wi\u0027 a rope inzaide. My waife could ba?ke one, if your ladyship thinks well on\u0027t. Tho\u0027 fai,\" he added doubtfully, \"\u0027twould need be a maighty big one.\" But Cicely could not allow the loyal fellow further to tax his inventive powers, she knew it was indeed kinder at once to crush his hopes. \"No, Peter, it will not do. \u0027Tis true such plans have succeeded once, but they could little avail us now. We must wait. Wait till to-morrow, I doubt not she will then be freed. If she be not,\" she added with a sudden shudder, as the fear of the alternative rose in her breast, \"why, Peter, if she be not, I will send for thee, and together we will free her somehow, tho\u0027 it cost us our lives.\" Peter begged to be allowed to stay in Taunton till the morrow, but Cicely dared not risk it. She was firm in her resolution that he must return, and return at once, and at length he reluctantly departed, still mourning over his shattered dream of rescuing his beloved lady from her prison, and bearing her back to Durford in triumph, even as did the heroes of old whose deeds she so admired, and with stories of whom she had so often dazzled his bewildered brain. The day passed, and as evening drew near, Cicely was seized with an irresistible fit of restlessness. This patient waiting was straining her nerves past endurance; she longed to be doing something, anything so it be definite action towards the release of her cousin. She could tolerate the quiet house no longer, she must out. Hearing that the lord chief justice and his suite were to enter the town that evening, she expressed her intention of going into the streets to see them pass. She longed to see this man of whom she had heard so much, the man upon whose lips hung the fate of her cousin, the fate of the thousand prisoners who lay that evening in the city awaiting their trial. Mistress Lane opposed the wish, but Cicely was resolved; she was obstinate, even irritable, in combating the good lady\u0027s arguments against such a course. She scarce understood herself this eagerness to see the judge\u0027s entry, she only knew that she must go out, must be interested, distracted, or she should go mad with the thoughts she could not banish from her brain. So Mistress Lane left her to go her way, and allowed Prudence to accompany her, tho\u0027 \u0027twas with many misgivings that she watched them set out. The two girls went their way and took up their position in the East street. The streets were very full, many people having come out to see the entry of the judges. Groups stood at the corners, gravely discussing the impending trial, men and women wandered aimlessly up and down waiting—waiting, they knew not for what. Everywhere was a spirit of restlessness, of suspense, and over all hung the great hush of expectation. Men spake for the most part in subdued voices, nowhere sounded the customary cries and cheerful noises of the streets. There were few outward tokens of grief; sorrow and anxiety had so long oppressed the people they had grown accustomed to their burden. To-night, however, the thought of the dark morrow looming threateningly before their sight had driven them out into the streets to wander restlessly to and fro seeking to escape from that fear which would not be shaken off, but followed ever behind them, whispering in the ear its dread suggestions. The spirit of that terrible tribunal moved on before; already the shadow of its presence darkened their hearts. As they waited in the East street, acquaintances of Prudence passed the girls, but none stopped to speak. Despite their kindness of heart the Lanes were not popular with their fellow-townsmen, who, perhaps naturally, felt suspicious of this prosperous Tory merchant. Presently Robert Wilcox approached and encouraged by a smile from Cicely he joined them, and the three strolled up and down the street together. A sense of loneliness oppressed Cicely as she watched the covert glances and whispers of the lovers. She tried to forget her own sorrows, tried not to listen to the dismal conversations of the passers by, but in vain. She could not escape from her thoughts, could not dismiss from her mind that dreaded verdict, heard on the lips, written on the faces of all around her, \"There is no hope.\" But at length a roll of kettle-drums announced the approach of the judges; and as the procession turned into East street, everyone paused instinctively to watch it pass. Dragoons, halberdiers, and carriages all went slowly past, and last of all came the great coach of the Chief Justice, Lord Jeffreys himself reclining carelessly on his cushions within. Cicely leaned forward eagerly to gaze at the man of whom she had heard so much, and gave an exclamation of astonishment when her eyes rested on his face. Where was the brutal, the ferocious judge of whom so many terrible rumours had reached her ears? Where was that monster of cruelty at whose name even the rough soldiers trembled? Surely not here. This man so wonderfully handsome, this man with the lofty brow, the noble expression, the sad, weary eyes, this could not be the terrible Jeffreys. Yet if it were indeed he, if it were—— Why surely then—— Her heart leaped high with hope. Surely then these stories must be false, base calumnies of the rebels even such as those which were told of Duke Monmouth by the supporters of the King. And then a confusion at the street corner, a trooper\u0027s horse down upon the cobbles, caused the procession to halt, the coach of the chief justice was stationary but two yards from where she stood. With a sudden wild impulse, born of new hope in her breast, Cicely darted into the roadway, pushing to right and left the astonished men, who would have barred her passage: darted quickly to the side of the coach and laid her hand on the shoulder of Lord Jeffreys as he reclined among his scarlet cushions. \"Mercy, my lord, mercy for my cousin,\" she cried, scarce knowing what she did. The occupant of the coach started from his reverie and turned to her, bewildered for the moment at the suddenness of her address. He had, in truth, been almost asleep, worn out with his painful journey over the rough country roads. \"What is it, woman? What did you say?\" he snarled sharply. \"Mercy, my lord, I entreat,\" she gasped nervously. \"\u0027Tis for one of the prisoners, my cousin, Mistress Barbara Winslow. She is indeed innocent enough, and, oh! my lord, she is so young.\" The judge gave a sudden harsh laugh, a laugh so full of needless cruelty that Cicely shuddered. She looked in his face and shrank back in dread, wondering could this be indeed the same man whose noble expression had so melted her, he was on a sudden so hideously transformed. All the ferocity of his violent nature, all the brutality of a pitiless heart were stamped upon his features. He was, indeed, at that moment, suffering acutely from the effects of his journey, and his mind, at no time tending greatly towards mercy and tenderness, was now warped and disfigured by weakness and pain into a very hell of cruelty. \"Mercy!\" he jeered. \"Mercy! Nay, there shall be no mercy. They shall all suffer, not one shall escape, not one. I will exterminate them all. Verily, I will make an example of these turbulent townsfolk, I will teach them a lesson they shall not soon forget. Mercy, aye, they shall have mercy, even such mercy as they have deserved. A merciful death.\" \"Ah, no, my lord! But for this girl,\" pleaded Cicely; desperately, \"surely for her.\" \"Drive on,\" shouted Jeffreys fiercely. Then seeing the coachman hesitate and glance doubtfully at Cicely, who clung to the coach door, he rapped out a string of oaths and roared to the man to whip up his horses and proceed. The coach moved on. But Cicely, desperate, still clung to the door of the coach, sobbing out her appeal. \"Ah, no, my lord! on this one at least have pity. No no, not death, my lord, not death.\" Then the chief justice, livid with fury, rose in his coach, and shouted to his coachman to lash at her with his whip, and drive her away. Terrified, the man obeyed, striking at her blindly. The lash stung across her hands and with a sharp cry she sank on to her knees on the road as the coach rolled onwards, Jeffreys lying back shuddering on his pillows, his face livid with agony, but the bitter smile still upon his lips.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1875/54236.html","bookId":805,"book":{"id":805,"title":"Barbara Winslow, Rebel","description":"简介： Whether James, Duke of Monmouth, would have succeeded in his enterprise had a different fortune attended his army at Sedgemoor, is a favourite subject for speculation among historians and others who interest themselves in the consideration of such st...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1875","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM"}}
