{"id":8939,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII","content":"Not until evening did Barbara emerge from her retirement. She found Sir Ralph seated by the spring, mightily refreshed with his sleep, but gazing somewhat gloomily at his surroundings. He greeted her appearance, however, enthusiastically. \"Ah! Barbara, that is well,\" he cried joyously. \"Methought you had vanished entirely. Come, sit here and talk. I have a thousand things to say to thee, now we are alone. This is like old times again, is it not?\" Barbara assented absently. She was wondering whither Captain Protheroe had vanished. She paid small heed to the look of admiration in her companion\u0027s eyes. \"You haven\u0027t forgotten the old days, have you, Barbara?\" he questioned, with a suspicion of tenderness in his voice. \"Of course not,\" she answered gaily. \"My memory is scarce so short. Why \u0027tis but five years since you were with us.\" \"And I have thought on you every day since we parted, Barbara,\" he continued softly. Barbara started, there was no doubt as to the tenderness of the tone. She was on her guard. \"Indeed, a most profitless proceeding,\" she answered sharply. There was a pause during which Ralph feasted his eyes upon his companion\u0027s face. Then he continued in a meditative voice. \"Do you remember, Barbara, how Rupert and I were wont to play we were knights tilting for our lady\u0027s favour? You were ever my mistress then.\" \"You had no choice,\" she answered laughing. \"Rupert took all others unto himself.\" \"Yet had you still been mine, Barbara, were there a thousand others, you alone. I wore your favour, and vowed to serve thee all my days. You have not forgotten that, Barbara? The day I took my vow?\" \"Alack-a-day,\" murmured Barbara to herself. \"Here now is Ralph gone crazy. Ah, me! what shall I do? And \u0027tis five years since we met. Can a man indeed remain so faithful?\" She looked at him doubtfully, but the look in his eyes left no room for doubt. Then she grew angry at the folly and the wilfulness of man, who seeks ever for love where it may not be found. Yet her anger was slight, seeing no woman is ever angry at love, however unsought, and she pitied him and liked him the more for his love. So she answered lightly, striving to drive him from his course. \"We played many games in those days, Ralph, I cannot mind them all.\" But he leaned across and laid his hand upon hers. \"\u0027Twas not merely a game to me, Barbara, surely you know that? You knew that when we parted, Barbara.\" Then springing to his feet, he burst out eagerly: \"Oh! Barbara, I swear I have thought on you each day these five long years. And now to find you again! You were lovely as a child, and I loved you. You are ten times more lovely now; why may I not love you still? And loving you, why may I not tell you so, as in the old days.\" \"Because—because—Oh! \u0027tis folly. We were but children then, and——\" \"Then let us be children again, Bab,\" he answered softly. \"See, the forest has brought us together again, and——\" But Barbara sprang to her feet, too angry with herself and shamed for having conjured up, in former days, this love which she could not still, and womanlike, angry with him for persisting in a love which pained her. For even the best of women look upon the heart of man as an unbreakable toy. They tread upon it unthinkingly. \"Indeed the forest has done nothing of the sort,\" she retorted angrily. \"Do not be so foolish, Ralph, or I will talk with you no more. \u0027Tis unfair to tease me with matters that are past and done with.\" He looked at her gravely. \"I am not foolish, Bab, and \u0027tis not past and done with yet,\" he answered stubbornly. \"Then, \u0027tis high time it was. Look you, Ralph, I am glad you are here, \u0027tis good to see you again, but an you pester me with such talk, I shall—I shall—— I won\u0027t have it, Ralph; \u0027tis unfair.\" He looked at her doubtfully, not knowing what to make of her anger. Then he submitted with a quietness that surprised her. Yet he deemed his cause not hopeless, only unripe. \"I am sorry I angered you, Barbara,\" he answered quietly. \"We will talk no more on the matter. Yet, perchance I seemed somewhat sudden. But I have always longed for you, Barbara, and when you came to me suddenly, in the wood, \u0027twas as tho\u0027 Paradise had opened to me again.\" Barbara answered nothing. She had seated herself again by the stream and was now plucking the grass and dropping it bit by bit into the rippling water, pondering the while why love may not beget love, and blaming herself for her ungracious acceptance of a constancy of homage a woman should be proud to win. Presently Ralph sat down again by her side, and eyeing her for a minute doubtfully, he began with some hesitation: \"Barbara!\" \"Well?\" \"Who is this fellow?\" \"What fellow, pray?\" \"Why, this Protheroe. Where did you meet with him, eh!\" \"I—I knew him first at Durford. He was quartered there with some troops, and rendered us some courtesy.\" \"Hum! I like him not.\" \"\u0027Tis a pity,\" she answered drily. \"No,\" he continued gravely; \"and I like not that you should be wandering thus in his company. Why not send him away now, Barbara?\" \"Certainly not.\" \"But wherefore not?\" he urged. \"Because I do not choose,\" she answered tartly. \"Besides \u0027twould be foul ingratitude. He saved me from prison.\" \"That is no reason why you should burden him with your protection now I am here. Indeed, Barbara, \u0027twere wiser to—to thank him, and leave him now.\" \"I will not. \u0027Twere most ungracious. And, prithee, how should we fare without him?\" \"Well enow, I warrant. See here, Barbara, he may be honourable enow——\" \"He is.\" \"Yes, but he is not one of us. He is but a soldier of fortune, and I like not that you should have to do with such an one. \u0027Twas vastly unseemly that you and he should be trapesing the country alone together, and I only hope no harm comes o\u0027t.\" \"And \u0027tis vastly impertinent of you, Ralph Trevellyan, to suppose that I cannot guard my honour and my own good name,\" she broke out hotly; for the suggestion in his words startled her, and stung her to the quick. \"How dare you speak thus? Upon my word, Ralph, you may be an old friend, but, certes, you presume on the fact.\" \"Good Heavens! Barbara. What is the matter? I only suggested——\" \"Then do not do so again. Captain Protheroe is a most honourable gentleman. \u0027Tis base of you to distrust him.\" \"Well! Don\u0027t be angry, Barbara,\" he pleaded quickly. \"You know in Rupert\u0027s absence——\" \"You put yourself in Rupert\u0027s place, eh? It suits you ill. Rupert hath both greater knowledge of me, and greater trust in me than thou hast, it would appear.\" \"Now, Barbara, dear—— Damnation!\" He dropped her hand and turned aside angrily, for a rustling of leaves and crackling of twigs announced the return of the third member of the party. Barbara greeted him brightly; she was relieved at his return. \"Whither have you wandered, sir? You have been absent for hours.\" \"I have been fishing, madame; behold my success.\" He crossed to her side, and with an air of deep pride laid before her three tiny trout. \"Is that all?\" she asked doubtfully, fearing lest a smile might hurt his feelings. \"All!\" he cried indignantly. \"Why, what would you more? There is one apiece.\" \"Assuredly, but——\" then she noted the twinkle in his eyes and burst into a merry laugh. \"Indeed, sir; you have kept your promise nobly. Yet I think we must thank the fates that we are not entirely dependent for our supper upon your skill.\" \"Ingratitude, thy name is woman! Here have I lain, arm deep in water, for three mortal hours, to catch these—er—tempting morsels, and all I meet with is contempt. Never again, Mistress Barbara.\" \"And have you not even the story of some monster who hath escaped you, to comfort your heart?\" she queried solemnly. \"I believe Rupert ever derived much solace from such illusions when he could produce no more substantial triumph.\" \"Alas, madame, I fear illusions are but little to my taste. But since you scorn my offerings, we had best make as good a meal as we can of the somewhat stale viands which remain to us, and then if you are rested, we ought to make a move.\" So they supped, and bidding farewell to the hollow, presently set out on their tramp. Their way led for some time through the wood, and when they finally emerged in the open country the night had already fallen. But Captain Protheroe knew the country well, he led them unerringly through meadows and along lonely and deserted bye-lanes, never pausing to doubt his path. They were, in truth, an ill-assorted party, these three, so strangely thrown together by Fortune, to tramp the night through. For the two men were divided by every difference of life, rank, opinion, and character; they were followers of different leaders, supporters of widely opposed causes, and but two months before they had been adversaries in one of the bloodiest battles of their time. And to this was yet added that fatal gulf twixt man and man, which even a lifelong friendship can scarce hope to bridge across—love for the same woman. By all tokens they should have hated each other, and assuredly they did. And Barbara? She had in hand a task which called for all the gentleness and tact of her nature. For with her lay the task of keeping these two at least in outward friendship, seeing from the one she could not, from the other she would not part. And yet, with neither, was her heart at ease. She could not rebuff Ralph, lest he in despair be again driven to desperate ends; moreover, the affection of a lifelong friendship, the gratitude for a constant love, above all, the loneliness of her position, forbade her be ungracious to one who loved so well. Yet even while she showed him kindness, her heart reproached her, knowing she was but leading him to hope for more. For \u0027tis ever so with women, their tenderness towards all misery leading them to be kind when they should be cruel, far more often than cruel when they should be kind. \u0027Twixt Captain Protheroe and herself, checking the free flow of her spirit, lay the ever-widening barrier of her pride. For when she discerned the tenderness in his voice, or worship in his eyes, while her heart leaped towards him in the sweet simplicity of her love, her pride cried to her to beware, telling her that it was nought but pity for her weakness. The words of Ralph had done their part, bringing, like the words of the serpent, evil to the breast of Eve. For an it were in truth so unseemly, this wandering with him alone which before had seemed to her so sweet, so natural, what then would men say of that embrace in the prison, given, indeed, in all simplicity, yet given unsought? Nay, but what mattered it what men said? what would he think? Would he think her light o\u0027 love? Her heart burned at the thought. So she mused ever, growing morbid in her weariness, with the strain of those last fearful days. So she mused, scorning him in a fierce defiance lest perchance he deem her simple, shrinking from him in a fierce shame, lest he deem her unashamed. Thus her troubled thoughts strove within her brain, but to all outward seeming she was as before, gay, gracious, natural as a child. Only in her terror lest she seem to ask for love, she devoted herself more and more to Sir Ralph, whose love was assured, chatting with him of days gone by, laughing over the remembrance of childish mischiefs. And for a time Captain Protheroe submitted to be set aside, striding on ahead in gloomy silence, thinking on the journey of the previous night, and cursing the Fates for sending them this interloper to part their company. But after a while his heart accused him of cowardice, thus to stand aside and leave to a mere foolish boy, so he deemed their guest, the winning of a treasure that he yearned to make his own. Truly he had not over-many pleasant recollections to recall to her mind, yet one he had sweet to him, since the knowledge of it lay between their two hearts alone. So suddenly, as they walked, he fell back a pace or two, and in a pause turned to her with the question: \"Where learned you the art of fence, Mistress Barbara?\" She started and blushed. Then answered with a spice of mischief: \"My master is beside me. Ralph initiated me in the art, and hath even greater skill than I, but we cannot all be experts,\" with a saucy glance. \"Of late years I have practised mostly with Rupert.\" He saw the mischief in her face, but forgave it freely. \"Methought I recognised a trick or two of Jules Berin when we crossed blades. Has your brother studied with him?\" \"No, but of his pupil. What know you of Jules Berin?\" she asked quickly, a note of suspicion in her voice. He laughed, and answered unheeding: \"Faith, I have been often to Paris, and we always have a bout together. For a soldier picks up many tricks in his wanderings, and, indeed, I have studied the art both in France, Italy, and the Low Countries. \u0027Tis one of the finest pleasures in the world\"—he continued with enthusiasm—\"to be pitted against a skilled adversary, straining every effort of wrist, eye and nerve.\" There was a moment\u0027s silence. Then Barbara demanded quietly: \"Then where learned you the trick of disarming yourself, sir?\" He started. \"Madame?\" \"Was it a trick or no? I had not deemed it so before, yet now I fear—— Confess, sir.\" He laughed softly. \"Alas, madame, you have entrapped me. I must confess to the trick. I learned it then, madame, when I learned many other matters \u0027twould scarce interest you to hear of.\" Barbara sighed and smiled. \"See how we poor women may be deceived by our own vanity. For ever since our meeting I have deemed myself a most excellent swordswoman, and gloried in my skill.\" \"But so indeed you are,\" he protested eagerly. \"And when we have the opportunity, I will teach you passes that perchance none save I and half a dozen others understand.\" But here Barbara must turn again to Ralph, who was listening jealously to the conversation which he could in no wise comprehend. Skilfully she drew him on to talk, and presently the two men were engaged in a deep discussion of their favourite pastime, waxing for the nonce almost friendly over their eager comparison of rival styles of fence. So they talked, merrily enough, well-nigh forgetting they were fugitives in fear of their lives. For brave hearts do not brood on distresses, but rather despise them, defying the oppressions of crabbed Fortune, and reaping gladness even from the sorrows she has sown. They walked the night through, halting at times to rest, jet for the most part pushing on as rapidly as possible, that their wanderings might be the sooner ended. Many a time, when the night had grown old, and the silence of weariness had fallen upon them, did Captain Protheroe glance anxiously at the girl at his side, for he knew nothing of the powers of a woman, and doubted whether he were not pushing her strength too far. But she answered him ever with a bright smile and quickened pace, though her limbs ached and her body was heavy with fatigue. For she would in no wise endure to be a drag upon his purpose, and he, marvelling at her endurance, let her be. Yet he was very tender towards her, wrapping her in his cloak whenever they halted for a rest, fetching her fresh water to drink, doing all in his power to ease her journey; and all without question or explanation, but with a gentle, quiet courtesy that softened even her pride, and led her to submit to his ministrations with a sweet gladness. Onward they journeyed, until with the first grey tinge of morning light they found themselves upon a wide moor, intersected by deep ditches, stretching wild and drear before them in the cold light of the dawning. Here and there on the wide expanse loomed dark and shadowy the outline of some village, the clustering houses pressing round the sheltering tower of the church. Here and there the light gleamed coldly on the dead waters of some still dank morass; it was a scene well suited to the corpse-like grey of dawn, a scene of utter desolation. The two men glanced quickly at one another as the growing light revealed each minute more distinctly their surroundings. Then with one accord they turned to Barbara. She was gazing about her in astonishment. \"What place is this?\" she questioned. \"\u0027Tis like a field of the dead.\" \"And so it is, Barbara,\" answered Ralph quietly. \"This is Sedgemoor.\" She shuddered fearfully. \"Truly a scene well fitted to the death of such a cause,\" she muttered. \"One would call it the haunt of devils. Why did you bring me here?\" Captain Protheroe shrugged his shoulders. \"It lay upon our way, madame, and I fear I thought no more on the matter. The world has many battlefields——\" \"But none as this one—to us.\" Then she continued more brightly, \"Whither go we, then?\" Captain Protheroe pointed across the plain to one oil the villages just emerging from the mist. \"Yonder is our destination, Mistress Barbara. \u0027Tis the village of Chedzey. In that village is an inn, an inn so atrocious that neither officer nor man of the royal troops would ever willingly put head inside the door. I lay there once, in ignorance, and had hoped never again to be so led astray. But times have changed, and it must be our refuge.\" \"But how? Surely the folk will suspect. Our dress——\" \"I purpose to go there as an officer of the royal army, who hath made an important capture of two desperate rebels, yourself and Sir Ralph, to wit. The capture was made this morning before daybreak. I have sent my men on to Wells to fetch an escort; we remain all day at the inn, and at night, our escort not arriving, we set out to meet them on foot. What think you of the scheme?\" \"\u0027Tis a mighty lame story,\" muttered Sir Ralph scornfully. \"Zounds, man, then devise a better,\" was the angry retort. \"What matter the story an we carry it off with a high hand? These rustics are simple enow, and they know better than to carp or question the words of an officer of the king. Besides, we cannot lie out here all day, and Mistress Barbara requires rest and food before she set off on another tramp.\" \"As you will then,\" answered Ralph somewhat sulkily, \"But the danger is great.\" \"Of course the danger is great. What then? In a great game a man must play high if he stands in to win. What say you, madame?\" \"That I fear you are a gambler, sir,\" she answered quickly, eager to dispel the quarrel. \"But since there seems no alternative, why talk further? Let us to Chedzey and trust to fortune.\" \"We must needs wait a little space. \u0027Tis somewhat early hours for calling.\" So they sat to rest, and watched the golden light sweep up the sky and shade softly into the pale rose of the sunrise. Presently Barbara turned to Captain Protheroe. \"Tell me a little how the battle was ordered,\" she commanded. \"Faith, madame, that is no easy task,\" he laughed. \"A man hath little time to note much of a fight save his own men and those immediately opposing him. And the greater part was fought in darkness, to boot. But—yonder at Chedzey lay our camp, the militia was at Middlezey and the cavalry with the general over there at Western Zeyland. \u0027Twas a night attack, you must know, and should have been a surprise, but the Duke\u0027s army, being stopped by the Bussex Rhine—yonder it lies.\" \"What! That little ditch to stop an army?\" \"Aye! But \u0027twas flooded then, full twenty feet across. And they made such a to-do being held up by a strange river that our outposts discovered them and we soon turned out. We couldn\u0027t get across at them, but drew up our men on the far side of the ditch and fired across. We were twenty feet apart, mind you, but their fellows fired too high and there was small slaughter on our side the ditch. Later we bridged the Rhine and got fairly at them, and then our cavalry came round from Western Zeyland and then \u0027twas soon over. There was no doubt of victory from the beginning, and but for the darkness and some confusion at first the fight had not lasted so long. The peasants fought bravely enow, I confess,—I would I had the training of some of them,—but the attack was bungled. Nothing was provided for, their guides led them astray, their ammunition was lost, they had no competent leaders, and not knowing whether to advance or retire, they stood still and were cut down like grass. The leadership was a disgrace. Lord Grey and the cavalry ran away, at the first shot, and the Duke and most of his officers directly after.\" \"By Heavens, sir! I will endure no more.\" Sir Ralph stood beside them, his hand clapped to his sword-hilt, his face crimson, his eyes blazing with fury. \"I will endure no more o\u0027 this!\" he cried. \"Is it not enough, sir, that you force yourself upon this lady\u0027s company, but you must needs poison her ears with lies concerning your damned victory, with dastardly slanders against myself and my friends? By Heaven, sir, but you shall answer for those words ere the world be a day older.\" Captain Protheroe stared for a moment in amazement. Then he gave a quick exclamation of annoyance and embarrassment. \"Peste!\" he muttered. \"I had entirely forgotten you were o\u0027 the other party.\" \"Maybe, sir, but that is no excuse for your words.\" The officer rose to his feet, looking annoyed and troubled. \"My words! I am sorry they offend you. Had I but remembered your presence I had not spoken so rashly, perchance. But—the words are spoken, and\"—with a shrug, \"i\u0027 faith, I cannot alter facts.\" \"Facts! The whole story is a dastardly lie.\" \"Sir!\" \"And you shall give me satisfaction.\" \"With the greatest pleasure, sir, as soon as I can come by a sword. I shall enjoy nothing more.\" Barbara gazed desperately from one angry man to the other, hesitating what best to do. Then she stepped between them with quiet dignity. \"Ralph! Captain Protheroe! Gentlemen! You forget yourselves, I think.\" Captain Protheroe flushed and bowed stiffly. \"Your pardon, madame,\" he said coldly. Sir Ralph looked moodily at the girl. The danger was not yet past. \"Captain Protheroe,\" she continued, with the same quiet air of command, \"I have dropped my—my kerchief in yonder ditch, I think. Will you have the goodness to go in search of it.\" He stared at the audacity of the request, for as Barbara had never approached the place she indicated, his search promised to be a somewhat fruitless one. But meeting her resolute glance he turned without a word, and strode down into the deep tangle of gorse and bracken that covered the bottom of that dried-up ditch. Then Barbara turned to Ralph, and used all her arts to bring him to a more peaceable frame of mind. \"Indeed, Ralph,\" she urged, \"\u0027tis sheer folly to be so enraged; you could scarce be more so had you run away in good truth. He meant not to offend thee, I am sure on\u0027t. He spoke but what he knew. Doubtless all the royal side think thus of the fight.\" \"But \u0027tis a sheer lie to say we ran away at the first shot, or for that matter, ran away at all. A foul, dastardly lie.\" \"Oh, hush, Ralph. He speaks but as he has heard, and doubtless he believes it to be true. Anyhow, \u0027tis nought to fight about.\" \"You don\u0027t understand, Barbara,\" persisted the enraged man impatiently. \"What should you know of a man\u0027s honour, and when it behooves him to fight for it? I tell you he must answer for his words.\" \"And I tell you you must not fight. Think, Ralph, suppose you killed each other, I should be alone.\" There were tears of desperation in her eyes; he was moved to pity. \"There, there! Barbara, don\u0027t you be troubled,\" he said, patting her hand with an air of humouring kindness. \"I promise you we will not fight yet, not at least till you are in safety. I doubt not \u0027twill need both our wits to get out of this pother. A quarrel does not stale with delay, we\u0027ll postpone it till more favourable date.\" And with that Barbara was for the present content. She had staved off the fight; who could tell what the future might bring? So they turned to seek Captain Protheroe, but he was not in sight, neither did he answer to their call. But hurrying to the edge of the fosse they peered down and saw him, on his knees, in a tangle of bracken, all his attention riveted upon a small packet which he held in his hands. Barbara called to him eagerly. \"I have found my kerchief, \u0027tis needless to seek further. What have you there?\" Then he rose to his feet, and climbed up to her side. The two on the bank stared at him in amazement; his eyes blazed with a strange light, and his voice trembled with excitement. \"Mistress Barbara! Sir Ralph! What think you I have found? Nay, you would never dream it. \u0027Tis a miracle of wonder. \u0027Tis well-nigh inconceivable.\" \"But what is it? What mean you?\" they cried in amaze. His hand shook with eagerness as he held out his prize. \u0027Twas a small letter-case in green silk, richly embroidered in gold; a maze of scrolls, in the centre of which were the letters J. M. entwined beneath a coronet sewn with pearls. Barbara looked at it in doubt; what might be there to cause such desperate eagerness. \"J. M.,\" she questioned. \"That is——\" \"James, Duke of Monmouth, madame, who else? And were there a doubt, the contents dispel it.\" \"The contents?\" \"Aye. I have already searched it. It contains five letters, so precious, madame, that it would seem he bore them ever about his person. How they came here is a mystery; he must have lost them in the hurry of his flight. \u0027Twas indeed irony of fate that he should lose them just in the time of need.\" \"But what are these letters?\" interrupted Ralph impatiently. \"Three are from Lady—from a woman.\" \"You did not read them!\" interposed Barbara quickly. \"Nay, madame, they are sacred. We will leave them to the grave Nature herself has prepared.\" He tore them in pieces and scattered them slowly into the ditch. Then as the last scrap of paper settled into the shadow of the gorse, he muttered softly: \"There lies, I doubt not, the story of a hopeless love.\" \"But the others!\" interposed Ralph sharply. \"The others!\" Here Captain Protheroe laughed quickly, all the excitement returning to his face. \"Ah! the old fox, how he duped us! These other letters are from no less a person than George Jeffreys, Lord Chief Justice of England.\" \"From Jeffreys, and to the Duke?\" \"Even so. Faith! I knew the scare at the Duke\u0027s invasion was great, but I never dreamed \u0027twas so serious as to lead so cautious a toad as Jeffreys thus far to commit himself.\" \"Read!\" commanded Barbara, in a maze of thought. So Captain Protheroe again unfolded the letters and read their contents aloud, while his companions listened with breathless eagerness. To his Grace the Duke of Monmouth by the hand of my Secretary Stephen Jewars: YOUR GRACE.—Concerning the matters upon which Mr. Ferguson hath already spoken with me, I do assure your Grace that I am your Grace\u0027s most devoted servant in this affair, and I do earnestly pray that your Grace\u0027s present undertaking may meet with success. The time is well nigh ripe for the attempt. The nation hath been much discontented with the manner of the late elections, and the speech of Master Edward Seymour (of which doubtless your Grace hath heard), is the subject of conversation throughout the town, having awakened much thought in the minds of the people. His present Majesty sits but unsteadily upon the throne, and his power will be yet more greatly shaken when he hath carried out that which is in his mind. For \u0027tis his fixed intention to forward by all means the cause of the Papish religion so abhorrent to the people of England, and to this end he purposeth as soon as may be to seek to bring about the repeal of the Habeas Corpus and the abolition of the Test Act. It needeth but the introduction of such measures to awaken in all power the indignation of this people, and to turn their eyes at once to him who alone is at hand to save them from tyranny and oppression, your Grace\u0027s self. Therefore, your Grace, I do most humbly beseech you to delay yet a little while, this undertaking, till His Majesty shall have so deeply committed himself in defence of his religion that his person shall have become abhorred of all the people, and your Grace shall indeed be welcomed as the saviour of an unhappy nation. And to this end, I will with all diligence seek to abuse the mind of His Majesty with regard to the will of his subjects, and so urge him more speedily on his course. I rely upon your Grace\u0027s sacred promise, to preserve this letter a secret even from your Grace\u0027s most intimate followers, for rumour is many tongued, and as you will readily conceive should a breath of suspicion light upon me, my power to assist your Grace with information of the Council Chamber will be forever destroyed. Ever your Grace\u0027s most devoted servant, GEORGE JEFFREYS. \"This second is dated June, written after the Duke\u0027s landing, when all London was in a ferment as to what should befall.\" YOUR GRACE.—I do greatly rejoice to hear what manner of welcome hath been accorded your Grace. Only a consciousness that I may better serve your Grace in my present post holds me back from hastening to your side. But I must warn your Grace that many preparations are about to be made to withstand your progress. General Feversham will start for the West in three days, and with him all the forces collected in this neighbourhood; General Churchill hath already departed thither with the Blues. His Majesty hath further summoned home such regiments as are at present abroad in the Dutch service, but their loyalty is greatly questioned, and \u0027tis also feared that the militia of Devon and Somerset will at the first encounter go over to the side of your Grace. It were wise, an it meet with your Grace\u0027s approval to strike rapidly for London, avoiding encounter with General Feversham (of whose route I will keep your Grace informed). For here be few troops and those of doubtful loyalty, and the late arrests in the City have won for your Grace many waverers. Again relying upon your Grace\u0027s promise to keep this matter secret I remain deeply grateful to your Grace for your most generous offers, and I pray Heaven to send your Grace all success in this undertaking. Ever your Grace\u0027s most devoted servant, GEORGE JEFFREYS. \"So they run. Treason clear enow, is\u0027t not?\" \"Pah! the traitor!\" cried Ralph furiously. \"And now, having himself conspired against the King, yet he goes free and sits high, judging his fellow conspirators.\" \"And such judgments,\" cried Barbara. \"Such wicked, brutal judgments. Oh! \u0027tis unbearable.\" \"And yet, Mistress Barbara, methinks his lordship is himself in no very enviable position. I doubt not he would give much to know the whereabouts of these letters. And when he sits in court, and rolls out his bloody sentences, I dare swear his own head feels somewhat unsteady on his shoulders.\" \"That which we overheard in the inn at Taunton, was not that also part of his treachery?\" \"By Heavens, yes. This explains his dealings with Ferguson. Doubtless Ferguson acted as go-between; he knew the secret and he is no man to spare his friend an he can use him. It was indeed highly important Ferguson should leave the country in safety.\" \"But why did not Duke Monmouth betray him?\" asked Barbara. \"Because the Duke was no traitor,\" answered Ralph sharply. \"Possibly,\" answered the captain drily. \"And otherwise, he had lost the proofs. Men say the Duke wrote to his Majesty, claiming to have some secret to confide in him after his arrest; is\u0027t possible he referred to this treachery of Jeffreys? But \u0027twould have been useless to bring such accusation without proof.\" \"Well, here are the proofs. Now what were best to do?\" began Ralph eagerly. \"Nothing.\" \"Nothing! What! when you hold in your hands such perfect revenge, wouldest leave the scoundrel free to guard his neck in safety?\" \"The safety of Jeffreys\u0027 neck is a matter of small importance to me compared with the safety of my own. Jeffreys is a man in power. There are, certainly, other men in power, who would give substantial consideration for the possession of this knowledge and who would joyfully work his ruin. Sunderland or my Lord Halifax, for example. There are such men, I say, but unfortunately, it is—er—far from convenient for me to appear before them at present. No, we are outlaws flying from the justice of the country, and the faster we fly, the wiser we shall be.
