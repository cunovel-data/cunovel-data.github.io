{"id":8941,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XX","content":"Mistress Fitch was a quiet old dame who, unlike the majority of her kind, concerned herself but little with her neighbours. Her connection with the Protheroe family had imbued her with a certain show of pride, and the gossips in their turn—finding that she displayed a disposition to resent their advances, and finding, moreover, that the old lady\u0027s uneventful existence furnished no scope for their curiosity—had ceased to interest themselves in her and her affairs. She lived in a house larger, indeed, than her needs, where one room was ever kept prepared for the occupation of her beloved Master Miles, should he chance to be in the neighbourhood. The main feature of her life indeed was a devotion to her foster-son; nothing he could do ever came amiss to her, and she had the most absolute confidence in his judgments. Accordingly, when he and his companions arrived late one night, and abruptly informed the old lady that they must take up their abode with her for a while, it required only a word or two of explanation of the circumstances of their position to satisfy the old lady, and to cause her to set about her preparations for their accommodation. They found but little difficulty in concealing their presence in the house. Lest an arrival had been noted, Mistress Fytch was instructed, if questioned, to speak of a visit from her nephew and niece from Taunton; but their entry into the house had been at a late hour, when the neighbours had already retired to rest, and as a matter of fact none had marked them. They dared not venture forth save after nightfall and then with extreme caution, but, although at times the hours hung somewhat heavily on their hands, the rest and the peaceful atmosphere of the house were very welcome after the turmoil of the past week. Barbara soon found full occupation for her time. With intent to relieve Mistress Fytch, she took into her own hands the greater part of the housework, and busied herself about parlour and kitchen with all the delight of a child engaged in a new amusement. She had certainly slight knowledge of the art of cookery, but it was never her nature to anticipate difficulties, and she applied herself to her new tasks with the same grave resolution, the same hopeful self-confidence that she was ever wont to bring to bear upon all her undertakings. Some of her experiments certainly horrified poor Mistress Fytch, but the old lady speedily grew to love the girl, despite her whimsies, and despairing of controlling so determined an assistant, she let her have her way. But Barbara had also another task to her hand. For Ralph, his strength exhausted by exposure and starvation, was laid low with a fever, and for two days lay delirious, dependent on her care. She nursed him with unwearying tenderness, though the duty was no light one, and she shrank in dread at his raving, which wrung her heart sorely. For ever his talk was of Barbara, Barbara his perfect woman, Barbara whom he worshipped with his heart and soul. And as she listened to his words, and learned the story of his years-long devotion, her heart grew heavy with pity and she redoubled her tenderness towards him, crying to herself that she was cruel, cruel, to have nought to give him in return. Even when the delirium passed, and he was on the speedy road to recovery, her self-reproach, her gratitude, led her in cruel kindness still to continue her tender ministrations, and as he watched her waiting upon him, hovering over him, ever watchful to supply his wants, it seemed to him that Mistress Fytch\u0027s simple rooms were changed to a veritable paradise, and those few short days passed like a glimpse of heaven. But for Miles Protheroe life during those days was alternate heaven and hell. For howsoever rapturously a man may love a woman, regarding constantly her courage, her beauty or even her disdain, yet is his love made more devout when he may watch her, moving simple, gracious, sweet, about her household work. Then first is revealed to him the full influence of her nature. No haughty queen, no unapproachable goddess she, but the bright light of a man\u0027s life, the very homemaker, glorifying by the beauty of her gracious presence the humblest tasks. Captain Protheroe thus day by day grew to love Barbara more, but with the growth of his love his despair increased at sight of her devotion to Sir Ralph. As she listened perforce to the sick man\u0027s ravings, he would steal from the room with despairing heart and maddened thought, that another could pour out to her so freely the words which he might not speak. So the days passed, until preparation for their escape from the country could be perfected. Captain Protheroe had not been idle in searching for news of a vessel bound for Holland. There was a certain old shipmaster, John Quelch, whom he had known since boyhood, and to him he resolved to turn for help, for Master Quelch, he knew well, was a frequent visitor to Wells, where his sister kept an inn. Accordingly at the inn he ventured secretly to seek news of him, and there, luck being with him, he discovered the man himself, and confided to him his difficulties. Master Quelch owed something to the captain\u0027s kindness in former days, and having readily promised his help, two days later brought the welcome news that his brother\u0027s vessel, the Roaring George, was shortly to sail from Listoke and the skipper would take them on board. He further suggested that they journey to the coast as his companions, and thus there would be less danger of interruption on their way, since such journeys of seamen and their relatives were frequent betwixt Wells and the sea, and he was a man well known upon the road. The fugitives accepted the offer right willingly, and this matter being arranged, time again hung heavily on Captain Protheroe\u0027s hands until the day arrived for departure. It was easy for Barbara to wait, busy with her many duties; it was easy for Ralph, still weak from his fever; but he had nought to do save sit hour-long watching Barbara at her work, and wondering wherein exactly lay the magic of her charm. All her ways fascinated him, and he could not keep his eyes from following her every movement. This persistent watch upon her doings for a time annoyed and embarrassed Barbara. She felt sadly conscious of a want of habitude in her work, and feared lest a critical brain lurked behind his observant glance. She endeavoured to appear perfectly confident even with the results of her cookery, but \u0027twas at times a trying effort. Yet, finding no comments were offered, and her failures passed unnoticed, she grew emboldened to meet him glance for glance, and what she read in his eyes was so unmistakable that it brought the blush to her cheek, and the mischievous smile to her lips, and, for women are at best but mortal, sent her about her work with added daintiness and allurement. But at length he could no longer satisfy himself with watching in silence; the force of his love, hopeless though he feared it to be, overpowered his prudence; he could not restrain his tongue. Barbara was in the kitchen, concerned with the making of a pasty. She was alone, nor aware of his presence in the next room, and as she worked she sang a plaintive little song concerning the mystery of love. Thus it ran: \"Oh! what is love? Some say it is but sorrow, Passion unholden, joy a three-part pain. Here for to-day but gone for aye to-morrow, Leaving behind a memory and a stain, If this be so, my heart it shall not move. Let me not love. Let me not love. \"Oh! what is love? Some say \u0027tis but a dreaming Born in the Spring-time of a single sigh. Blazing in glory, earth an Eden seeming, Dying of passion as the roses die. If this be so, if love a vision prove, Let me not love. Let me not love. \"Oh! what is love? A worship all undying. Faith looks to faith, and heart to heart has fled. Faith is fulfilled, no more the soul goes sighing. Love is for aye, and time itself is dead. If this be so, if earth a heaven may prove. Ah! give me love. Ah! give me love.\" Scarcely was the song ended when Captain Protheroe strode abruptly into the room, and crossing to her side seized her almost roughly by the arm. \"Mistress Barbara,\" he asked hoarsely, \"know you aught of what you sing?\" She paused, silent, wondering at his tone. \"Ah! Mistress Barbara,\" he continued more gently; \"would it were mine to teach you the meaning of your words.\" But, though she dearly loved to read that look upon his face, yet at his words a spirit of mischief possessed her; and, maiden-like, loving him she loved to show him cruelty that she might hereafter prove the kinder in atonement. So drawing from him she turned to place her pasty in the oven, at the same time asking mischievously: \"What! Wouldest teach me that love is sorrow, sir?\" He smiled at her and shook his head. \"Nay, that was not all your song, Mistress Barbara.\" \"A worship all undying,\" she repeated softly. Then she turned to him demurely. \"Captain Protheroe, how long is\u0027t since you saw the lady of whom you spake to me in the forest, she who was once your queen?\" He started back angrily. \"Mistress Barbara! Who hath been spreading scandalous stories concerning me?\" he cried in a fury of indignation. She stared at him in amazement. \"Nay, sir, none that I know on,\" she faltered. \"Then what——\" \"I did but wonder how long a man\u0027s \u0027worship undying\u0027 lives,\" she answered mischievously. He eyed her keenly for a moment, then he laughed. \"Sure a man can scarce be writ down inconstant because he remain not true to his childhood\u0027s love.\" \"Yet some men have proved themselves so constant,\" she murmured softly. \"That should be easy, madame, to one who hath known you all his life,\" he answered quickly, disarming her by his gallantry. Then he continued: \"\u0027Twould indeed go hard with me, must I forfeit all other loves for that one, seeing the lady hath been wed for more than ten years.\" \"She is wed! Ah!\" Then she looked at him curiously. \"You loved her once?\" she asked gently. \"Love!\" he cried quickly. \"What should a boy of eighteen know of love? Oh! he may dream he loves, but he knows nought of life; to him all women are angels. But when a man loves, a man who knows his world, who hath seen both what is good and evil in woman, who hath outgrown his illusions; when he loves—— Ah! madame, what must a man feel, who, having learned to detect the flaw in every gem, yet finds one perfect pearl; who, having come to fear that purity in woman is but a dream of youth, yet meets one to restore to him his hope. Ah! truly, a boy may love a perfect woman, but a man must worship her with all his soul.\" There was silence between them. Presently he continued more lightly. \"That, Mistress Barbara, is a man\u0027s love; what do you know of a woman\u0027s?\" \"A woman\u0027s love!\" she began dreamily. Then on a sudden she sprang to her feet with a sudden cry. \"Oh! my pasty, my pasty! I had altogether forgot it.\" She flew to open the oven-door, but alas! it was too late, the pasty was a cindered crust. She drew it out and laid it on the table, then turned to Captain Protheroe with a look of deep reproach. To her indignation he was laughing heartily at the disaster. \"Oh! \u0027tis too bad!\" she cried indignantly. \"\u0027Twas you who made me forget it.\" \"\u0027Pon my honour, Mistress Barbara, I am very sorry,\" he answered penitently; \"is\u0027t indeed ruined. Could we not scrape it or—or in some other means——\" \"No,\" she answered in melancholy tone; \"\u0027tis useless. I must e\u0027en set to work upon another.\" \"But I may stay and talk to you?\" he pleaded. \"Certes, no,\" she cried sharply; \"\u0027twould but cause me to forget again. Prithee, leave me alone, I do better so. Indeed I will not have you here. Go!\" She frowned angrily, and he fled from her in despair, nor marked the blank look of disappointment on her face when he obeyed her, nor the sigh with which she turned again to work. For man will never understand that he was not born to obey woman, and that woman, true to nature, does not require obedience at his hands. \u0027Twas that same evening. Ralph was rapidly recovering health and spirits, and the three were seated together in his room, chatting merrily. Presently Mistress Fytch climbed the stair, and entered the room, her face beaming with pleasure. \"Mistress Barbara, my dearie,\" she began. \"There is a pedlar below.\" \"A pedlar!\" cried Barbara, springing up with an alacrity that drew a laugh from both her companions; \"a pedlar!\" \"Aye, dearie. \u0027Twas Master Miles here bid me find one, saying you had need of matters for your journey. This fellow hath but just come to town, and they tell me he hath some rare stuffs to show, so I e\u0027en bade him bring them here to-night.\" \"Oh! Nannie, how good, how—how heavenly of you,\" cried Barbara with shining eyes. \"I will go to him on the instant, I will buy of his best, I will. Oh! how I have grown to hate the very sight of this gown! To think that I need no longer wear it!\" She clapped her hands in sheer delight. \"Don\u0027t buy the whole pack, Barbara,\" cried Ralph cheerily as she hurried away; \"or we must charter a special vessel to carry your wardrobe to Holland!\" \"You grow well too fast, Ralph,\" was the laughing reply. \"I must needs put you on bread and water an you wax too impertinent.\" She shut the door behind her, and tripped down the stairs humming a merry tune, all a woman\u0027s inexplicable joy of purchase dancing in her eyes. The visitor was in the parlour, into which opened alike the door of the staircase and the door of the street. He was standing with his back towards her, busily unstrapping his pack, but turned upon her entrance. On a sudden her cheeks grew white as her kerchief, and her eyes filled with fear. It was none other than Simon!—For a moment she hoped wildly that he might not recognise her or, even recognising her, might not be aware of her arrest and trial, but the hope was destined soon to fade. For an instant the man stared at her in amazement, then a quick gleam of satisfaction flashed across his face, and he broke into a low chuckle. \"Mistress Barbara Winslow!\" he cried with an ugly grin at the trembling girl. \"I come from Taunton, Mistress Winslow, from Taunton, where there be those who mightily desire your presence. There\u0027s an empty cell in Taunton gaol for your ladyship, there\u0027s an idle whipping-post awaiting you there, Mistress Barbara Winslow!\" Again he chuckled and rubbed his hands with malicious glee. Barbara\u0027s first impulse was to cry for help, and so bring down the two men from above stairs to her aid. But with an effort she controlled herself, for she perceived on the instant what must be the result. The pedlar was but a step from the street door; at her first alarm he would make his escape, and returning speedily with the guard, would secure not herself alone, but her friends. Her wit seemed to desert her now, in her greatest need; she could devise no plan of escape to insure the safety of the three. As yet the others might be safe, the man knew nothing of their presence in the house. Was it not better, braver, to go with him at once, surrender herself, since clearly Heaven willed not her escape, and so shield her companions from the danger that threatened them? For had Captain Protheroe rescued her from prison (she gave poor Rob little credit for his share) only that she should, by cowardice, betray him now? And Ralph! Had she saved him from death in the forest, only to insure for him a death a thousand times more horrible? Ralph, so weak, so lightly despairing, who loved her so truly. Yes, she might still save these two who had done so much for her. She would not shrink from the sacrifice. Her mind was made up. \"God wills it,\" she said. \"You have found me. I will go with you.\" \"That is wisdom, mistress,\" grinned the man. \"\u0027Tis not here as at Durford.\" Quickly he put up again his pack, and shouldering it, laid his hand upon her arm. Firm and unflinching Barbara followed him to the door. Simon laid his hand upon the latch, another moment and they would have been in the street. Suddenly he paused. He turned his head to listen, and a smile of low cunning crept slowly into his eyes. For they heard the opening of a door, and a man\u0027s cheery whistle sounded in the room above. Barbara gave a quick gasp of terror, she felt the pedlar\u0027s eyes were fixed upon her face. \"Quick, quick,\" she cried losing her wits in her excitement; \"let us be off. Someone is coming.\" \"Aye,\" said the man slowly; \"someone is coming. And there are two rewards to be won in Taunton.\" He released her arm, and still with his hand upon the latch, turned to confront the newcomer. Barbara could do no more. With a sigh of desperation she sank into a chair and covered her face with her hands. The door opened and Captain Protheroe appeared. For a moment the two men stood staring at each other, then the truth flashed to the brain of the soldier and he made a spring forward to secure the pedlar. But the man was too quick for him; he darted through the already opened door, into the street, slamming the door behind him. Captain Protheroe was about to follow, but recognising the hopeless folly of such action, he stopped, and having fastened the door turned to where Barbara sat, white and trembling. \"The fellow knew you?\" he asked sharply. \"Yes, he was about to take me to the guardhouse,\" she answered, trembling. \"Good Heavens! why didn\u0027t you cry for help? We might have seized him perchance.\" \"I—I feared, an I did so, he would discover that you and Ralph were here,\" she stammered. \"\u0027Twould have undone all three. And Ralph——\" \"You would have gone without a word?\" Barbara hesitated. \"I—I could not bear that Ralph should be taken,\" she muttered, shy even then, of confessing her fear for his capture too. He looked down at her for a moment with deep pain in his eyes: \"I see,\" he said gently; \"I—I understand.\" She knew that he did not understand but she could not tell him so, and indeed he gave her no time. In an instant he was alert, ready for action. \"No time to lose, Mistress Barbara,\" he said cheerily. \"We must be out of this directly. I\u0027ll give your friend a quarter of an hour to tell his tale and return with the guard.\" \"But how! Where?\" she cried desperately. \"Ralph can\u0027t travel yet.\" \"He must. You don\u0027t know, Mistress Barbara, what can be done when it\u0027s a case of do it or hang. Come.\" They hurried upstairs, summoned Mistress Fytch, and quickly told their story. Ralph was up in an instant. \"I\u0027m ready,\" he cried abruptly. \"What are the orders?\" He had learned much during the past ten days. Despite his jealousy of Captain Protheroe he knew him as one to be relied on, and his love for Barbara forbade him do aught that would increase the difficulties of the one man who could save her. \"We\u0027ve little time to consider ways and means now,\" muttered Captain Protheroe, striding about the room as was his wont when in deep thought. \"You\u0027ll take Mistress Barbara at once out by the north gate (twill not yet be closed) and go by the fields to Mallet, \u0027tis but a mile hence. Nannie must go too—\u0027tis safe here for her no longer; and she knows the road.\" The old dame was called and matters quickly explained to her. \"Very good, Master Miles,\" she answered, as calmly as though he had bidden her serve his supper. She had implicit faith in her foster-son in all matters save those appertaining to the care of his health. \"To Mallet then, and wait there. Is Johnny Dean still living, Nannie?\" \"Why, for sure he is, Master Miles, why not? Shall I take the young mistress thither?\" \"Yes, go to Johnny Dean\u0027s and wait me there.\" \"But you? What will you do?\" cried Barbara suspiciously. \"Why, Mistress Barbara,\" he answered, smiling and drawing from his breast the green silk letter-case found in the Sedgemoor ditch. \"I purpose to see an these letters will fetch their price.\" \"But how? Of whom?\" \"Of whom but the man most likely to pay it, my Lord Jeffreys.\" \"What? you would go there, to him, alone! Oh, no, no, you must not, indeed you must not. \u0027Tis too rash, \u0027tis madness. Better risk all than that you—you should—— Oh! Captain Protheroe, we can\u0027t leave you behind.\" Her voice trembled, her eyes were full of tears. For a moment he hesitated, gazing at her with surprise, with a faint, wondering hope; but he shook his head. \"Do not be afraid, Mistress Barbara,\" he said lightly; \"I have faith in the power of these bits of paper. Trust me, I\u0027ll join you ere two hours are passed.\" Somewhat comforted by his words, Barbara said no more. She had learned to know by his face when he had made up his mind, and recognised that further argument would but waste time. When the two women had left the room in search of cloaks, Captain Protheroe turned abruptly to his companion. \"Look you, Sir Ralph, this is a desperate strait. You can await me at Mallet till nine o\u0027clock. If by that time I have not come, then go north, make for Listoke, try to get aboard the Roaring George. And, look you, take these letters (I have made copies of them). If you are ta\u0027en, get them to Churchill, or, better still, Rochester. They may save you yet, even if I fail.\" \"But, Heavens, man! if you fail it\u0027s death for you. Why not come with us, and try to win to Holland? Why go to Jeffreys at all?\" \"Because, tho\u0027 a desperate chance, \u0027tis worth risking. Zounds! man, you don\u0027t think. What hope have two women and a man weak with fever of escaping the royal troops? Practically none, unless I can buy free pardons for all and a safe conduct into Holland from Jeffreys.\" The women being now ready to set out, Captain Protheroe went with them to the door at the back of the house, from whence a short labyrinth of streets led to one of the gates of the town. There he turned to the girl who stood beside him, her dark eyes gleaming in the shadow of her hood. It was a crimson hood and reminded him of the night he first met her in the country lane at Durford. \"Good-bye, Mistress Barbara,\" he said wistfully. A sudden fear awoke in her eyes. \"But you will come after us, you will see me again?\" she cried quickly. \"Assuredly, Mistress Barbara,\" he answered softly; \"if there be pity in Heaven I shall see you again.\" She looked at him doubtfully, but urged him no more. \"God keep you,\" she said gently. Captain Protheroe watched them disappear in the darkness. But he failed to note a dark figure flit from the shadow of a neighbouring house, and follow them on their way.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1875/54245.html","bookId":805,"book":{"id":805,"title":"Barbara Winslow, Rebel","description":"简介： Whether James, Duke of Monmouth, would have succeeded in his enterprise had a different fortune attended his army at Sedgemoor, is a favourite subject for speculation among historians and others who interest themselves in the consideration of such st...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1875","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM"}}
