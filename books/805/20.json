{"id":8940,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX","content":"The village of Chedzey was little more than a collection of mean cottages, the largest of which was the inn. The inhabitants were already stirring, and the wife of the innkeeper was standing at her door when the party approached. She stared in amazement and pity at Barbara\u0027s tattered garments and weary face, and cast a scowl in the direction of the officer whom she recognized as one of the hated Tangiers regiment, lately the scourge of the countryside. To his demand for beds and breakfast she answered sulkily that he must seek further, the house could provide him nothing, and even when he sharply urged his commands, she advanced grumbling objections and refused to move from the doorway. But upon this her husband appeared, in fear at sight of the officer, and sharply bade her hold her peace, and let the strangers enter. \"Art mad, wife?\" he whispered. \"Wouldest have the house burned about our ears, that thou darest to thwart one o\u0027 Kirke\u0027s officers? Stand by, and let him have his way.\" \"Thou wast ever a chicken-hearted fool, John,\" retorted the woman scornfully. \"This is an honest house, and not for such wastrels as they o\u0027 the royal army. But have your way and don\u0027t blame me an you like not your customers.\" \"Pardon, your honour,\" cried the man, bowing low before the captain. \"The woman\u0027s tongue runs out of all holding. Peace, jade, and get you in, or \u0027twill be the worse for you.\" With an angry glance at her husband the woman withdrew, and the host led the way upstairs into a poorly-furnished parlour, where after some little delay breakfast was served, no very tempting meal, but welcome indeed to the famished travellers. Judging that where most is told, least is surmised, Captain Protheroe gave mine host a detailed account of the capture of his prisoners, adding such realistic details as most appealed to his sense of fitness. His horse, he said had been shot by the rebel, hence his journeying to the village on foot, his only trooper having been despatched to Wells for fresh horses and escort. Barbara and Ralph listened with great interest to the dramatic account of the latter\u0027s desperate struggle, with difficulty refraining from applause at the close of his picturesque statement. But the woman\u0027s eyes filled with tears, when she learned the nature of her guests, and when later she conducted Barbara to her chamber, she hung over her with a thousand tender offices, bathing her tired feet, brushing out her tossed hair, doing all in her power to increase the comfort of the weary girl. \"Eh! my dearie, my dearie,\" she cried pityingly. \"What will they do to thee? And so young, too, as thou art. But \u0027tis a black-hearted crew they are, and no denying it. My heart bleeds for thee, my beauty. Curse them! Curse them to hell, say I. Nay, my tongue runs wildly, I know, but who could help it. Look you, my pretty, I have a son, even such as thy brother yonder, but younger by some years. To the fight he would go, I could not hold him back. And I sat here all that bloody night, hearkening to the firing, dreaming that each shot bore his death. He came not back. Then I went out to search; I sought night and day among the slain, but he was not there. So I blessed Heaven, and waited his return. But he comes not, nor sends, and I know not where he lies; at times \u0027twould seem I can bear no more, but must e\u0027en go seek him through the world, till I find him. Ah, my lamb! my son, my bonny son, where art thou?\" Thus she wailed, and Barbara, despite her weariness, comforted her as best she might, praying to Heaven for pity on this sorrow no earthly hand could soothe. Presently the woman recovered, and with many apologies, rose to leave the room, yet she turned once again before she reached the door. \"My dearie, it seems not possible to aid thee, yet be sure, an I can do aught for thee, I will do it. And who can say? A chance may offer. I will watch. Now sleep, I will weary thee no more.\" In order to give more realism to the story of his capture, and also to prevent their disturbance, Captain Protheroe chose to rest in the parlour, out of which both the sleeping chambers led. As luck would have it, they were the sole visitors to the inn, a little-frequented place, and were consequently left to sleep in peace throughout the day. They were full wearied, and it was not until five in the evening that Captain Protheroe roused his companions, and summoning mine host, gave orders that dinner be presently served. The three adventurers were thoroughly refreshed by their long rest, their spirits were high, and when they assembled at the meal they were all prepared to play to the utmost advantage their several parts in the game of chance upon which they had embarked. Therefore, while mine host prepared the table, Captain Protheroe, remembering his story, enquired most particularly whether his escort had not yet arrived, expressing great indignation when he learned that it was yet to be expected. Barbara laughed mockingly behind mine host\u0027s fat back while this conversation was toward. Her amusement increased as the game proceeded. She longed to add dramatic touches of her own, but prudently refrained. Nevertheless, she challenged the officer mischievously with her eyes, and he, accepting the challenge, cursed the lazy trooper roundly, rated mine host, and bade him keep sharp lookout lest the escort, missing the house, ride past unheeding. So they sat down to dinner, mocking at Fortune, jesting over the gulf which yawned at their feet. And Fortune, in revenge for their confidence, turned her wheel. For, as danger oft shows least when nearest to hand, scarcely had they commenced their meal when the sound of approaching horses broke upon their ears, and two minutes later after a confusion of shouts, the door was burst open, and mine host hurried into the room. \"Your honour!\" he cried joyously. \"All is well. Your honour\u0027s escort has arrived.\" Ralph dropped his knife with a rude clatter, and half started from his seat, while a quick gasp of fear escaped from Barbara\u0027s white lips. Captain Protheroe paused for a moment, his glass to his lips; cool soldier though he was, his hand trembled and the red wine splashed over the brim and stained his sleeve. Then he turned on mine host with a sudden oath: \"What mean you by this intrusion, blockhead?\" he thundered. \"Shut the door and say your say. What is\u0027t?\" \"The escort, your honour,\" stammered mine host. \"\u0027Twas even as your honour supposed. They had mistaken the place, and would have ridden past, had I not hailed them, saying your honour was even here. They wait in the street below.\" \"Let them wait, we cannot set out yet, before we have dined,\" retorted the captain sharply. \"See the men have drink, and leave us. Shut the door behind you,\" he shouted as mine host left the room, \"\u0027tis most infernally cold here.\" Directly the door was closed, all three sprang to the window. \u0027Twas even as the man had said. In the street below six mounted troopers were drawn up; but their leader was not in sight, he stood talking to mine host at the door. \"Heaven help us!\" cried Ralph desperately. \"What to do now, I wonder. What in heaven and earth can we do?\" Barbara was silent, her eyes fixed on Captain Protheroe\u0027s face. He strode the room fiercely as his custom was, in thought. Then he gave a short laugh. \"So much for vainglorious boastings,\" he muttered. \"Out of our own mouths we are betrayed. Certes, the game is against us now. We could hold the room—but that were folly. And escape is not to be thought on. Yet—Pah! what a fool! No. I see nought to be done, save wear a bold countenance, and play out the game to the end. \u0027Tis a wise maxim when the luck turns. And it may be the men have not yet heard——\" Again the door was opened and mine host entered once more; the joyous importance had died from his face; he looked depressed and dubious. \"Your honour!\" he began nervously, \"I seem, in my zeal to obey your commands, to have mistaken the matter. These men are not your honour\u0027s escort, but a party of dragoons riding from Bridgewater to Wells. Nevertheless, seeing the escort does not yet arrive, and learning your honour\u0027s difficulty, they put themselves at your honour\u0027s service. And their honourable commander craves the honour of waiting upon your honour in your honour\u0027s room.\" A moment\u0027s perceptible silence, then with a curt \"\u0027Tis well, bring him here,\" mine host was dismissed. The three fugitives waited in silence for the man\u0027s return. Only when the soldier\u0027s footstep sounded on the stairs, Captain Protheroe leaned forward and laid his hand on Barbara\u0027s arm. \"Do not be afraid, Mistress Barbara.\" he said quickly. \"We will win safe through this somehow. Trust us.\" And Barbara, with trembling lips, smiled bravely back at him. \"I am not afraid,\" she said simply. Then mine host, with many obsequious bows, ushered in the visitor. The officer was a big, blustering fellow, coarse of face, and rough in manner. He strode noisily into the room, and on seeing the captain burst into a boisterous laugh. \"Ha, Protheroe, my boy! Well met. The fellow below couldn\u0027t tell me your name or I warrant you I\u0027d have been up here long before. What\u0027s all this about your escort, eh? Lost your horse, two captures, and the fool of a trooper not yet returned. Ha, ha! Protheroe, you go well to work. \u0027Tis good I came this way, you\u0027d scarce fancy passing the night here, eh? We are riding to Wells and can take you on with us.\" \"Good!\" answered the captain quickly. \"But we\u0027ve no hurry to start yet awhile. Sit down and drink, man, the night\u0027s young enough yet, and my men may still come. Look you, fellow,\"—to mine host,—\"set out more wine, and then begone and see to the men below. And harkee, don\u0027t come crashing in like a wild bull again; if we want you I will call. And if my men arrive, let them wait below. Now begone.\" Then he turned to his guest. \"Come, Jonas, sit down, and drink; there\u0027s no need to start for another hour.\" Captain Jonas was standing in the centre of the room, hat in hand, bowing elaborately to Barbara, and ogling her the while with his great protruding eyes. \"By Jove, Protheroe!\" he drawled, \"is this your capture. Zounds! What a prize. You\u0027re a hard man to keep such a beauty in limbo. Best put yourself under my protection, mistress; I\u0027ll keep you safe. I\u0027ll not swear to set you free, but at least I\u0027ll wager that pretty face shall never waste in prison.\" Checking swiftly an angry movement from Ralph, Barbara curtsied with quiet dignity, and moved again to her seat at the table. \"Oh, ho! a lady, eh? Who is she, Protheroe?\" asked Captain Jonas in an audible whisper. Captain Protheroe shrugged his shoulders. \"Pah! Only a rebel. Come, drink, man, and tell Us news. Where do you hail from?\" \"Bridgewater! As dead and drear a hole as ever man was quartered in. Praise be to the devil we\u0027re moving on to Wells, and in a month we\u0027ll be quit o\u0027 this cursed west country, where there is neither a pretty woman—saving your presence, madame—nor a decent bottle of wine for a man to solace himself withal. I thought you were at Taunton, Protheroe!\" \"I was—till yesterday. Is there no news from your way?\" \"By-the-way, Protheroe!\" he exclaimed with a sudden burst of laughter, setting down his glass and slapping his knee. \"How could I have forgot it! I\u0027 faith there is news, news o\u0027 the queerest, and you are the very man it concerns.\" \"Ah! What then?\" \"A fellow came over from Taunton yesterday morning with the wildest tale. Some cock-and-bull story of your arrest, and then later of a prison-breaking, and your disappearance with some woman. But \u0027twas but a half-drunk trooper, and as I was over in Taunton on Monday and heard nought o\u0027 the matter, I beat the fellow as a slanderer of the King\u0027s service. \u0027Twas all a lie, I suppose.\" Captain Protheroe glanced quickly at the speaker. Then he leaned across the table and poured out a fresh glass of wine. \"Well, no, not entirely a lie,\" he answered coolly. \"I was arrested, a jest of the colonel\u0027s, some wager with my Lord Jeffreys. I was released in the morning, of course. The prison-breaking is true, too, \u0027twas the same night. But a tale grows like a mushroom in the telling. Heard any news from town?\" \"What should I hear in a hole like Bridgewater?\" answered Captain Jonas indignantly. Then he turned to Barbara, at whom he had been staring with insulting openness ever since his entrance. \"I could swear I have seen your face before, madame, but I can\u0027t for the life of me recollect where. \u0027Tisn\u0027t a face one forgets soon, neither,\" he continued, ogling her afresh. \"My poor face is honoured by your recollection, sir,\" answered the girl coolly. \"It must be some time ago that we met. Since my escape I have necessarily had little converse with the King\u0027s officers.\" The man laughed loudly. \"I don\u0027t doubt it, madame. Your escape, eh? So you broke prison, did you? Was that long since?\" Barbara bit her lip in irritation at her slip. \"Some while since, sir. But few words make least mischief, so, an\u0027t please you, I\u0027ll keep my story for the crown lawyers to devise. You can hear it then, an you care to attend my trial.\" \"By Jove, madame, you have courage,\" laughed the man admiringly. \"Come, what is your name?\" \"That also, sir, \u0027tis the lawyer\u0027s business to discover,\" she answered calmly. The soldier laughed once more, and turning to Captain Protheroe, he entered forthwith into a keen discussion as to the merits of the new regiments the King was then raising and the possibility of the formation of a large standing army in the country. The three conspirators drew sighs of relief at the change of subject, and for some little time there was peace, while the new arrival chattered, drank, and ogled Barbara, and they waited with anxious hearts for the next move in the game. Suddenly Captain Jonas broke off abruptly in the middle of a dissertation concerning the absolute demand for more careful training of cavalry, and after staring for a moment fixedly at the girl, he burst into a quick laugh. \"By Jove! I have it,\" he shouted. \"\u0027Twas in court at Taunton, I saw you, madame, and not later than Monday last. I saw your trial. What a fool I am! And the name, the name? What was it now? Ha, ha! madame, I\u0027ll have it in a minute, we\u0027ll not leave it to the lawyers to devise.\" \"Well! Lydia Philbeg, an you must have it,\" answered Barbara calmly. But Captain Jonas shook his head. \"Softly, madame, it ran not so. Philbeg! No, I swear that was not the name.\" \"What a pother about a name,\" interrupted Captain Protheroe impatiently. \"Leave the girl in peace, an she wishes to be unknown. Fill your glass, man, and pass the bottle. \u0027Tis poor stuff, but what can one expect in such a hole? Where are you quartered in Wells, eh?\" \"We put up at the Green Buck. \u0027Tis not much of a place, but the wine is fair, and old Dame Barbara has—By Heavens! the very name. That\u0027s queer now. Barbara——Barba—Barbara Winslow or I\u0027m a Dutchman! Your health, Mistress Barbara Winslow. Ha, ha! I knew I\u0027d remember it soon. We toasted you after the trial, before I rode back to quarters. Lydia Philbeg, forsooth! Ha, ha! madame, I\u0027ve got you now!\" \"\u0027Well, I hope to goodness you\u0027re satisfied now, Jonas,\" answered the Captain impatiently. \"What a man you are for hunting a hare to death!\" But a sudden gravity had come over Captain Jonas. \"Barbara Winslow!\" he muttered. \"Zounds! Protheroe, that\u0027s queer. \u0027Tis the very name of the woman they said you had run off with from Taunton gaol.\" Captain Protheroe set down his glass suddenly. He saw suspicion dawning in his companion\u0027s eyes. \"Hang it all, Jonas! The fellow must have been a d—— an infernal fool. Mistress Winslow escaped indeed, and I was posted after her in pursuit, and caught her this morning. That\u0027s the length of the story. Why, devil take you, man, if I had run off with her, should I be here now? Not unless I was a greater fool than—than you are.\" But suspicion still hardened in the soldier\u0027s eyes. \"Then did the lady escape alone?\" he questioned cunningly. \"I bore Mistress Winslow company,\" interrupted Ralph quietly. Captain Jonas turned to him sharply. \"You?\" he asked contemptuously. \"And who may you be?\" The youth drew himself up haughtily. \"I am Sir Ralph Trevellyan,\" he answered, eyeing the captain defiantly. \"Ralph Trevellyan. Why that\u0027s the name o\u0027 the fellow who escaped us at Burrows\u0027 Farm, four days syne. Burrows\u0027 son told me so himself, under the whip. You never saw the inside of Taunton gaol, my friend.\" \"Tut! man,\" interposed Captain Protheroe lightly. \"Let them have their little romance. We can prove their identity well enow, so a lie more or less is no matter, and seems to cheer their spirits mightily. Fill your glass, and tell us the latest about the fair Arabella.\" Captain Jonas darted a sharp glance at the speaker. Captain Protheroe leaned back in his chair, and met the suspicious glance with a lazy smile. But behind his nonchalant demeanour his wits worked shrewdly, and he never for an instant took his eyes from his companion\u0027s face. There was a slight pause. Then in an altered voice Captain Jonas asked: \"Where did you take them, Protheroe?\" \"Peste! What a man you are for detail. If you must have the story, I ran them to earth between four and five this morning, in hiding in Mart Mill three miles south of Bridgewater.\" A strange light crept into Captain Jonas\u0027 eyes. There was dead silence for a moment before he answered in a strange voice: \"That is strange, Protheroe. I drew that cover myself this morning at four o\u0027clock, and I\u0027ll be sworn it was empty.\" Then suddenly dashing down his glass, he sprang to his feet. \"By Heavens, Protheroe!\" he shouted fiercely, \"I believe you\u0027ve been lying to me from beginning to end.\" But he got no further. Ere Captain Protheroe could snatch his sword from its sheath, Ralph was at the man\u0027s throat, burying his fingers deep in the soft flesh. Captain Jonas was a strong man, and despite the suddenness of the attack, he fought with desperate fury. They swayed together, tottered, fell; rolling over in a wild indistinguishable mass of struggling limbs. There was no sound, save only Ralph\u0027s quick breathing and now and again a choking, inarticulate cry from Captain Jonas. Over again they rolled, and now the man\u0027s struggles were weaker. Ralph\u0027s grip had told. \"Oh! are you killing him?\" whispered Barbara, watching the struggle in horror. \"No, he\u0027s not dead yet,\" gasped Ralph. \"Out of the way, Barbara, while we finish him.\" \"Ah, no! You will not kill him now!\" she gasped. \"There will be no need if he is quiet,\" answered the captain quickly. \"But we must get him out of the way as soon as we can. Give me a cloth to gag him.\" Quickly Barbara tore off her kerchief, and together the men gagged his mouth, and strapped his arms with his own sword-belt. They rifled his pockets of money, and took sword and pistol, for necessity knows no law. Meanwhile Captain Protheroe devised his plan. \"We must get out of here as soon as possible,\" he urged, \"or these cursed troopers will be down on us. And \u0027twere useless to slip away secretly, \u0027twould but arouse suspicion, and bring mine host to the search. We must play high again and carry it off by a bold show. What then? The gallant captain is drunk, he would have been so in another hour, had he been left in peace. We will put him to bed, and bid the men leave him undisturbed. Then we take three of the troopers\u0027 horses and ride off, leaving them to follow. when their officer is returned to his senses. What say you?\" \"But is there no risk——\" began Barbara. \"Good Heavens! madame, of course there are, a thousand risks, but we have no time to stop and count them. Once let the men discover us, and it\u0027s all over. Now to bed with this gentleman. We must wait a little to give him a reasonable time to get drunk, and then—away.\" They carried Captain Jonas into one of the bed chambers, tied him securely to the bed with one of the sheets, and covering him over well, they left him, locking the door behind them. Then they sat down to wait, their hearts leaping at every footstep, watching the light fade in the west, and listening to the distant sounds of the troopers carousing at the back of the house. But after half an hour they could endure no more. Ralph\u0027s nerves were shaken by the struggle, for his strength was not yet returned after his wound, and Barbara was trembling from head to foot. So Captain Protheroe resolved to wait no longer, but to make their escape while they could. Accordingly they descended the stairs, and summoning mine host, they paid their reckoning generously, telling him at the same time that the captain had gone to sleep and must in no wise be disturbed. Mine host showed no surprise. He knew his wines, and doubtless was accustomed to the speedy overthrow of his guests. Moreover, it was not often that his house met with such patrons, and he blessed Heaven secretly for his good fortune in sending him a second officer in need of a night\u0027s shelter. Then, with some misgivings Captain Protheroe summoned one of the troopers, and bade him bring up three of the horses. But the man was half-fuddled with drink, and only stared stupidly at the officer. So they thrust him aside and unhitched the horses themselves, and the cool, leisurely manner in which they went about the business disarmed suspicion, and none made a motion to gainsay them. Captain Protheroe lifted Barbara into the saddle. She was perforce obliged to ride astride. He felt her tremble in his arms, but her face was calm and firm. The woman came out of the house with a cloak and wrapped it round her. Barbara stooped down quickly. \"The troopers!\" she whispered; \"keep them here. I may escape from him, but from the troopers never.\" The woman patted her hand tenderly. \"Trust me, my dearie,\" she answered softly. \"An wine can make them drunk they shan\u0027t move till morning. God keep thee safe, my dearie.\" \"And bring your son to you again.\" \"I ride to Wells,\" said Captain Protheroe as he mounted. \"If my men arrive send them after me. Tell Captain Jonas I hope to meet him there anon. Good-even.\" They clattered off into the darkness. \"Was that wise?\" whispered Barbara when they had left the village behind them. \"Will they not seek us in Wells?\" The captain smiled sagely. \"Truth is often expedient, Mistress Barbara, because no one believes it. Captain Jonas is one if those crafty fools who if they would ride secretly to Wells say loudly: \u0027I ride to Taunton,\u0027 and follow the road a mile or so before they double back, chuckling at their wisdom. I trust him to judge me by himself.\" \"Is not horse-stealing a capital offence?\" queried Ralph cheerfully. Captain Protheroe laughed. \"I\u0027 faith, I have committed so many capital offences during the last three days, that one more or less is of small moment. Prison-breaking, petty larceny, assault and robbery, and horse-stealing; \u0027tis a lively record.\" \"We are well out of the last danger,\" sighed Barbara. \"By Heavens! Yes. I thought not to get off so easily. My only plan was to make the fellow drunk, or to lead Mistress Barbara to feign illness when \u0027twas time to set out, and so we remain behind. But the stars are on our side, we have not only routed the enemy, but got off with their supplies and transport, into the bargain. We should be at Wells by nine o\u0027clock.\" \"And what then? How shall we enter? Will not the gates be shut?\" \"I think not. An they be \u0027tis no great matter to have them opened. They make small difficulty of letting any enter, \u0027tis in getting out the trouble lies.\" \"Aye! \u0027tis ever easier to go into a trap than to get out again,\" muttered Ralph doubtfully. \"Oh, Ralph! what words of ill omen!\" cried Barbara with a shudder. \"In truth, I see not why we should go to Wells at all. Why not ride straight to the coast?\" he queried, discontentedly. \"Simply because Mistress Barbara cannot lie out in any hole and corner, until we have the luck to find a vessel bound for Holland. She is not as we are,\" answered Captain Protheroe sharply. \"In Wells she will be at least comfortably housed.\" \"But indeed I am strong. I can endure hardship,\" cried Barbara eagerly. \"Think not of that. Let us to the coast an it be indeed the safer plan.\" \"On my honour, Mistress Barbara, I believe the boldest plan is ever the safest. I know that the coast is strictly guarded, escape in these garments would be impossible; we have \u0027fugitive\u0027 writ large upon us. But who would dream of seeking us in Wells? Where should we be safer than under the protecting care of my Lord Jeffreys himself?\" So they acquiesced, and galloped on rapidly through the gathering darkness. But half-a-mile from the town they halted, and dismounting, drove their horses into the fields, deeming it wiser to enter the town on foot. Half-an-hour later they were safely sheltered in an old rambling house, situated in the lower part of the towns where Mistress Fytch dwelt.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1875/54244.html","bookId":805,"book":{"id":805,"title":"Barbara Winslow, Rebel","description":"简介： Whether James, Duke of Monmouth, would have succeeded in his enterprise had a different fortune attended his army at Sedgemoor, is a favourite subject for speculation among historians and others who interest themselves in the consideration of such st...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1875","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM"}}
