Only the kitchen stood between him and her, the pathway delineated by the preparation/cooking area to his left and an older, sturdily built wood table to his right.\n Her shirt was already off and her arms were reaching behind her, unclasping a sensible bra that was notable only for its color—black—and the saucy red bow that nestled between her small breasts. “Are you going to stand out there all night, Deputy?”\n She was running in overdrive. Christ. Not that he minded, but…\n Actually, he did mind. He was too wound up to just fuck her into a good time and get shown the door. He wanted his fill, needed it, so he could get his damn brain out of his pants and back in the game.\n His T-shirt was already clearing his head when he crossed into the house and kicked the back door closed. He threw the dead bolt and turned back to her, tossing the condoms on the dining table before dealing with his holster, badge, and belt.\n Darcy continued to strip while he did, her movements rushed and without artifice yet still sexy as hell. Those heavy-lidded eyes…the flushed cheeks…the glistening parted lips…\n Everything about her screamed “sex” to him. He almost tripped in the process of toeing out of his boots, and forced himself to stand still while he tore open the button fly of his jeans. The freeing of his engorged cock was such a relief he groaned, a sound he repeated with more vehemence when she kicked off her panties and set her hands on her hips. Waiting. Naked. Ready.\n He grabbed one of the two boxes of condoms and ripped it open, snagging a string of foil-wrapped packages in grasping fingers. Prowling forward, Jared separated one square and caught the rest between his teeth, deftly suiting up as he closed the distance between them.\n Wide-eyed, she backed away. Her chest heaved with panting breaths; her tongue darted out to wet dry lips. He pursued her to the couch, watching as the backs of her legs hit the edge of the cushions and she sprawled into them.\n He shoved the coffee table aside with a push of his foot, his focus solely on her and the feminine hunger that poured off her in waves of near-tangible heat. She stared at his dick with an avarice that made his balls tighten. His jaw unclenched on a deep inhale, releasing the condoms to fall to the floor.\n Crowding her into the corner, Jared caught the back of the sofa with his left hand and cupped her pussy with his right, looming over her.\n “Oh!” she gasped in that little girl voice that drove him crazy.\n “Good,” he growled, his fingertips gliding through silky moisture. “You’re wet and hot. Primed for fucking.”\n Her neck arched back as he parted the lips of her cunt and massaged her clit. “Yes. Do it.”\n Bending his head, he caught her upraised lips before he thought about it. Kissing wasn’t an act he much cared for himself. Or so he’d thought. But then his mind had shut off at some point between the unhooking of her bra and the removal of her panties. He was eating at her mouth as if he could sate his hunger that way, devouring her, delving into the silken recesses with a greed he couldn’t control.\n Her low moan only goaded his ferocious need. He sucked on her tongue as she licked into his mouth, sliding the circle of his lips up and down the slender protrusion, relishing the way she shivered and slickened the hand massaging her pussy.\n With eyes half lidded with desire, Jared lifted his head and watched her as he pushed two fingers into her, watched the way her swollen lips parted on a gasp. He penetrated her slowly, deliberately, holding her gaze with his so that he owned her pleasure. He took her to the knuckles, then withdrew, biting his lower lip at how tight and plush she felt. How slick and hot.\n “Umm,” he purred, his dick aching with the need to be where his fingers were. “Open your legs wide, Darcy. Let me get to you.”\n Her lithe thighs spread gracefully, her heels lifting to the couch and her knees falling open. Presented with a beautifully pink and depilated pussy, Jared felt his tenuous control slipping by the moment. He pumped his fingers deep and fast, over and over, fucking her pretty juicy cunt until she was grinding her hips into his hand and making sexy little noises. She cupped her tits in a kneading grip, her fingers tugging at the hard little nipples, her breath escaping her arched throat in mewling pants.\n All the while he hovered over her mouth, teasing her with tantalizing flicks of his tongue, staying just far enough out of reach that she couldn’t have the deep French kiss they both craved. It would be too much, he’d lose his mind and his restraint, and he needed her to come first. Needed to ease the desperate tightness of her pussy. Because once he got into her, all bets were off.\n “Yes.” She gasped, her slim torso glistening with perspiration. “Yes, I’m going to come…Oh, God…”\n Darcy fell into climax with a violent full-body shudder, her cunt clutching at his working fingers with a strength that nearly set him off. He dropped to his knees, his mouth replacing his hand, his tongue spearing through her tender convulsing tissues. He consumed her like a man possessed, burying his face in her silky wet core, tonguing her cunt until she came again. And again. Her short nails clawing at the sofa as she cried out words he couldn’t hear over the rushing of blood in his ears. He couldn’t get enough. Needed more of her taste, her pleasure, her surrender.\n Her damp palm pressed to his sweat-slick forehead, pushing him away. “Jared…Jesus…I’m going to pass out before you get inside me.”\n Fuck that. He’d eat more of her pussy later, when she was too wiped out to argue and his dick wasn’t throbbing like a son of a bitch. Damned if she’d check out before he got his cock in her.\n Wiping his mouth on her inner thigh, Jared rose and caught the back of her leg over his arm. He pulled it high and wide, opening her completely.\n She grasped him in both hands, making him wince as the pleasure of her touch threatened to send him over the edge. Her gaze stayed with his as she positioned him at her opening, sliding the crown around in her wetness before notching him into her tiny slit.\n “God, Darcy. This is gonna be so fucking good.”\n The weight of his body was the force behind his entry. As his cock sank into her cushioning pussy, his breath hissed out in agonized pleasure. He’d never been so hard or his body so tense.\n Whimpering, she writhed beneath him. “Jared.”\n The way she said his name, in that breathless girly voice, did him in. He dug his feet into the floor and he drove deep, spearing into her with a mindless thrust. Her back bowed, crushing her small breasts into his chest. The feel of her pressed against him was like a punch to the gut. His abdomen clenched, his blood raged, and his adrenaline spiked. Her cunt quivered around him, massaging his tormented dick, stealing any possibility that he might’ve reined himself in.\n He groaned, his hips churning against hers. “You feel amazing…so damn tight and plush…”\n Darcy’s teeth sank into his shoulder, her hands clutching at his waist. The bite of pain was perfect, enough to jolt him out of the haze of near-painful pleasure and goad him into moving.\n Shoving his arms beneath her, Jared caught her to him, crushing her against him from shoulder to hip. With her pelvis tilted up to cradle him and her body completely restrained by the bands of his arms, he possessed her completely. He gave a tentative thrust, withdrawing partway, then shoving back inside her.\n She released his shoulder, her head falling back to once again arch over the armrest. She moaned. “Do that again.”\n “All night,” he promised darkly, taking her with another fierce stroke, watching the need flare higher in the depths of her jade green eyes. “You won’t remember what it felt like to go without my cock inside you.”\n Darcy’s cunt clenched around him and he broke. Rearing back, he lunged hard and deep. His tempo increased, faster and faster, until he was riding her relentlessly. Pounding into her. Nailing her to the couch with powerful drives of his hips.\n In a distant part of his mind, he knew he was taking her too roughly, working her snug pussy too hard, but she was taking everything he had to give her and demanding more.\n “Harder,” she gasped, throwing her hips at him. “Deeper. Ah…you’re so big. It’s so good…”\n It was beyond good. She was killing him with her enthusiasm—the raking of her nails across his back, her heels in the backs of his thighs spurring him on, her silky tissues rippling up and down his aching cock. And her voice, which rivaled the rhythmic slap of his heavy balls against her damp flesh as the most erotic thing he’d ever heard.\n “You’re driving me crazy,” he growled, unable to stop fucking her, needing to get deeper inside her. He was bottoming out with every plunge, filling every inch of her, his eyes rolling back because she was deliciously tight and scorching hot. The softly feminine smell of her skin was going to his head, intoxicating him, making him dizzy. Just when he thought he might blow it and go off without her, she began to tense.\n “Oooh.” She shivered violently. “I’m going to come again.”\n “Do it.” Jared bit down on her shoulder, relishing the way she jerked and tightened around him in response. He grunted as she pulsed in tiny spasms. “Just like that…Milk my cock. Ah, hell…”\n She climaxed with a cry, the delicate tissues that hugged him tightening into a velvet fist before convulsing in the milking grip he’d demanded of her. Pinning her shoulders, he held her immobile and jackhammered through her orgasm, his own spiraling like molten metal down his spine and pooling in his balls.\n His head fell back on a serrated groan, his body bowing as her pleasure fueled his, enflaming him. Cum spurted from the tip of his cock with a ferocity that rocked him, stinging his eyes and tightening his throat. His straining muscles burned and quaked, his entire body rigid as he emptied himself into the condom.\n He might have lost his sanity in that mind-blowing moment if not for Darcy. She was right there with him, meeting him stroke for stroke.\n Chapter four\n Despite the sweat that ran in rivulets down her overheated body, Darcy missed Jared’s weight and the feeling of him inside her the moment he rolled away. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/on-fire-shadow-stalkers-4/page-5.html","bookId":1921,"book":{"id":1921,"title":"On Fire (Shadow Stalkers #4)","description":"Storyline: \n On Fire (Shadow Stalkers #4) \n Every time she opened her mouth, his mind went straight into the gutter… \n When Deputy US Marshal Jared Cameron started investigating a series of arson attacks in the small seaside town of Lion’s Bay, he had no idea that the biggest blast of heat would come from the fire inspector.
