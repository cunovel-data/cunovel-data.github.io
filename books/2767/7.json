{"id":86001,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\"Phone sex?\"\n \"Yeah. Touch yourself, Brit. And then tell me what you\u0027re doing. It\u0027ll totally turn me on.\"\n \"While I\u0027m touching myself, what\u0027ll you be doing?\" I ask him.\n \"Choking the gopher. What\u0027d you think I\u0027d do, my homework?\"\n I laugh. Mostly it\u0027s a nervous laugh because we haven\u0027t seen each other in a couple of months, we haven\u0027t talked all that much, and now he wants to go from \"hi, nice to see you after a summer apart\" to \"touch yourself while I choke the gopher\" in one day. I feel like I\u0027m in the middle of a Pat McCurdy song.\n \"Come on, Brit,\" Colin says. \"Think of it as practice before we do the real thing. Take off your shirt and touch yourself.\"\n \"Colin . . . ,\" I say.\n \"What?\"\n \"Sorry, but I\u0027m not into it. Not now, at least.\"\n \"You sure?\"\n \"Yeah. You mad?\"\n \"No,\" he says. \"I thought it\u0027d be fun to spice up our relationship.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know we were boring.\"\n \"School . . . football practice . . . hanging out. I guess after a summer away I\u0027m sick of the same old routine. The entire summer I\u0027ve been waterskiing, wakeboarding, and off-roading. Things that get your heart racing and blood pumping, you know? Pure adrenaline rush.\"\n \"Sounds awesome.\"\n \"It was. Brit?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"I\u0027m ready for that adrenaline rush . . . with you.\"\n CHAPTER 8 Alex\n I push the guy up against a sweet, shiny black Camaro, one that probably cost more than my mom makes in a year. \"Here\u0027s the deal, Blake,\" I say. \"You either pay up now, or I break somethin\u0027 of yours. Not a piece of furniture or your fuckin\u0027 car . . . somethin\u0027 you\u0027re permanently attached to. Get it?\"\n Blake, skinnier than a telephone pole and as pale as a ghost, is looking at me as if I just handed him his death sentence. He should have thought about that before he took the Big 8 and bounced without paying up.\n As if Hector would ever let that happen.\n As if I would ever let that happen.\n When Hector sends me to collect, I do it. I may not like doing it, but I do it. He knows I won\u0027t do drug deals or break into people\u0027s homes or businesses to steal shit. But I\u0027m good at collecting . . . debts, mostly. Sometimes it\u0027s people, but those get to be messy affairs, especially because I know what\u0027s gonna happen to them once I haul them back to the warehouse to face Chuy. Nobody wants to face Chuy. It\u0027s way worse than facing me. Blake should feel lucky I\u0027m the one assigned to look for him.\n To say I don\u0027t live a squeaky-clean life is an understatement. I try not to dwell on it, the dirty job I\u0027m doing for the Blood. And I\u0027m good at it. Scaring people into paying us what\u0027s ours is my job. Technically my hands are clean of drugs. Okay, so drug money does touch my hands quite frequently, but I just hand it over to Hector. I don\u0027t use it, I just collect it.\n It makes me a pawn, I know. As long as my family is safe, I don\u0027t care. Besides, I\u0027m good at fighting. You can\u0027t imagine how many people break down with the threat of their bones breaking. Blake is no different than the other guys I\u0027ve threatened, I can tell by the way he\u0027s trying to act cool while his spindly hands are shaking uncontrollably.\n You\u0027d think Peterson would be afraid of me, too, but that teacher wouldn\u0027t fear me even if I shoved a live grenade into her hands.\n \"I don\u0027t got the money,\" Blake blurts out.\n \"That answer ain\u0027t gonna cut it, man,\" Paco chimes in from the sidelines. He likes coming with me. He thinks of it as playing good cop/ bad cop. Except we play bad gang member/worse gang member.\n \"Which limb you want me to break first?\" I ask. \"I\u0027ll be nice and let you choose.\"\n \"Just smoke his sorry ass, Alex, and get this over with,\" Paco says lazily.\n \"No!\" Blake shouts. \"I\u0027ll get it. I promise. Tomorrow.\"\n I shove him against the car, my forearm pressing on his throat just enough to scare him. \"As if I\u0027m gonna take your word for it. You think we\u0027re stupid? I need collateral.\"\n Blake doesn\u0027t answer.\n I eye his car.\n \"Not the car, Alex. Please.\"\n I take my gun out. I\u0027m not going to shoot him. No matter who I am and what I\u0027ve become, I\u0027d never kill anyone. Or shoot anyone. Blake doesn\u0027t have to know this, though.\n At the first glance of my Glock, Blake holds out his keys. \"Oh, God. Please, no.\"\n I snatch the keys out of his hand. \"Tomorrow, Blake. Seven o\u0027clock behind the old tracks on Fourth and Vine. Now get outta here,\" I say, waving my gun in the air for him to run off on foot.\n \"I\u0027ve always wanted a Camaro,\" Paco says after Blake is out of sight.\n I toss the keys to him. \"It\u0027s yours--until tomorrow.\"\n \"You really think he\u0027ll come up with four G\u0027s in a day?\"\n \"Yeah,\" I tell him, totally confident. \" \u0027Cause that car is worth way more than four G\u0027s.\"\n Back at the warehouse, we give Hector the update. He\u0027s not happy we haven\u0027t collected, but he knows it\u0027ll happen. I always come through.\n At night, I\u0027m in my room unable to sleep because of my little brother Luis\u0027s snoring. By the way he sleeps so soundly, you\u0027d think he didn\u0027t have a care in the world. As much as I don\u0027t mind threatening loser drug dealers like Blake, I wish to hell I was fighting for things worth fighting for.\n A week later I\u0027m sitting on the grass in the school courtyard eating lunch by a tree. Most of the students at Fairfield eat outside until late October, when the Illinois winter forces us to sit in the cafeteria during lunch period. Right now we\u0027re soaking up every minute of sun and fresh air while it\u0027s still decent outside.\n My friend Lucky, with his oversized red shirt and black jeans, slaps me on the back as he parks his butt next to me with a cafeteria tray balanced on his hand. \"You geared up for next period, Alex? I swear Brittany Ellis hates you like the plague, man. It\u0027s hilarious watchin\u0027 her move her stool as far as she can from you.\"\n \"Lucky,\" I say. \"She might be a mamacita, but she ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 on this hombre.\" I point to myself.\n \"Tell your mama that,\" Lucky says, laughing. \"Or Colin Adams.\"\n I lean back against the tree and cross my arms. \"I had phys. ed. with Adams last year. Believe me, he\u0027s got nada to brag about.\"\n \"You still pissed off \u0027cause he trashed your locker freshman year after you smoked him in the relay in front of the entire school?\"\n Hell, yeah, I\u0027m still pissed. That one incident cost me a shitload of money having to buy new books. \"Yesterday\u0027s news,\" I tell Lucky, keeping up the cool facade I always do.\n \" \u0027Yesterdays news\u0027 is sittin\u0027 right over there with his hot girlfriend.\"\n One look at Little Miss Perfecta and my defenses go up. She thinks I\u0027m a drugged-out user. Every day I\u0027ve dreaded having to deal with her in chem class. \"That chick has a head full of air, man,\" I say.\n \"I heard that ho was dissin\u0027 you to her friends,\" a guy named Pedro says as he and a bunch of other guys join us carrying either trays from the cafeteria or food they brought from home.\n I shake my head, wondering what Brittany said and how much damage control I\u0027ll have to do. \"Maybe she wants me and doesn\u0027t know any other way to get my attention.\"\n Lucky laughs so hard everyone within a few yards stares at us. \"There\u0027s no way Brittany Ellis would get within two feet of you on her own free will, giley, let alone date you,\" he says. \"She\u0027s so rich the scarf around her neck last week pro\u0027bly cost as much as everythin\u0027 in tu casa.\"\n That scarf. As if the designer jeans and top weren\u0027t fashionable enough, she\u0027d probably added the scarf to showcase how rich and untouchable she is. Knowing her, she had it professionally dyed to match the exact shade of her sapphire eyes.\n \"Hell, I bet you my RX-7 you can\u0027t get into her panties before Thanksgiving break,\" Lucky challenges me, breaking my wayward thoughts.\n \"Who\u0027d want those panties?\" I say. They\u0027re probably designer, too, with her initials embroidered on the front.\n \"Every single dude in this school.\"\n Do I need to state the obvious? \"She\u0027s a snow girl.\" I\u0027m not into white chicks, or spoiled chicks, or chicks whose idea of hard labor is painting their long fingernails a different color each day to match their designer outfits.\n I pull a cigarette from my pocket and light it, ignoring Fairfield\u0027s no-smoking policy. I\u0027ve been smoking a lot lately. Paco pointed it out yesterday night when we hung out.\n \"So what if she\u0027s white? Come on, Alex. Don\u0027t be an idiot. Look at her.\"\n I take a glance. I admit she\u0027s got it goin\u0027 on. Long, shiny hair, aristocratic nose, slightly tanned arms with a hint of muscle in her biceps to make you wonder if she works out, full lips that when she smiles you think world peace is possible if everyone had her smile.\n I shove those thoughts from my mind. So what if she\u0027s hot? She\u0027s a first-degree bitch. \"Too skinny,\" I blurt out.\n \"You want her,\" Lucky says, leaning back on the grass. \"You just know, like the rest of us Mexicanos from the south side, that you can\u0027t have her.\"\n Something inside me clicks on. Call it my defense mechanism. Call it cockiness. Before I can switch it off, I say, \"In two months I could have a piece of that ass. If you really wanna bet your RX-7, I\u0027m in.\"\n \"You\u0027re trippin\u0027, man.\" When I don\u0027t answer, Lucky frowns. \"You serious, Alex?\"\n The guy will back down, he loves his car more than his mama. \"Sure.\"\n \"If you lose, I get Julio,\" Lucky says, his frown turning into a wicked grin.\n Julio is my most prized possession, an old Honda Nighthawk 750 motorcycle. I rescued it from a dump and turned it into a sleek ride. Rebuilding the bike took me forever. It\u0027s the only thing in my life I\u0027ve made better instead of destroying.\n Lucky is not backing down. Time to either back down myself or play the game. The problem is, I\u0027ve never backed down . . . not once in my life.\n The most popular white chick at school would sure as hell learn a lot by hanging with me. Little Miss Perfecta said she\u0027d never date a gang member, but I bet no Latino Blood ever tried to get into those designer pants.\n Easy as a fight between Folks and People--rival gangs on a Saturday night.\n I bet all it\u0027ll take for Brittany to come around is a bit of flirting. You know, that give-and-take wordplay that heightens your awareness of the opposite sex. I can kill two birds with one stone: get back at Burro Face by taking his girl and get back at Brittany Ellis for having me called into the principal\u0027s office and dissin\u0027 me in front of her friends.\n Might even be fun.\n I imagine the entire school witnessing the pristine white chick drooling over the Mexicano she vowed to hate. I wonder how hard she\u0027ll fall on that tight white ass when I\u0027m done with her.\n I hold out my hand. \"Deal.\"\n \"You gotta show proof.\"\n I take another drag of my cigarette. \"Lucky, what do you want me to do? Pluck out one of her fuckin\u0027 pubes?\"\n \"How\u0027d we know it\u0027s hers?\" Lucky responds. \"Maybe she\u0027s not a real blond. Besides, she pro\u0027bly gets one of those Brazilian wax jobs. You know, where every thin\u0027 is--\"\n \"Take a picture,\" Pedro suggests. \"Or video. I bet we could make muchos billetes on that thing. We can title it Brittany Goes South of the Border.\"\n It\u0027s trash-talkin\u0027 times like these that give us a bad rep. Not that rich kids don\u0027t talk trash, I\u0027m sure they do. But when my friends go at it, it\u0027s no-holds-barred. To be honest, I think my friends are damn entertaining when they\u0027re ragging on someone else. When they\u0027re ragging on me, I don\u0027t find it half as funny. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-7.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) \n A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers. \n When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \u0027perfect\u0027 life is about to unravel before her eyes.
