{"id":86014,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"As I pull her kick-ass car into the dark library parking lot, I say, \"Thanks for, you know, lettin\u0027 me kidnap you. I guess I\u0027ll see you around.\" Taking my keys out of my front pocket, I wonder if I\u0027ll ever be able to afford a car that isn\u0027t rusted, used, or old. After I step out of her car, I pull out Colin\u0027s picture from my back pocket and toss it on the seat I just vacated.\n \"Wait!\" Brittany calls out as I\u0027m walking away.\n I turn around and she\u0027s right in front of me. \"What?\"\n She smiles seductively as if she\u0027s wanting something more than a truce. Way more. Shit, is she gonna kiss me? I\u0027m taken off guard here, which usually doesn\u0027t happen. She bites her bottom lip, as if she\u0027s contemplating her next move. I\u0027m totally game to making out with her.\n As my brain goes through every scenario, she steps closer to me.\n And snatches my keys out of my hand.\n \"What do you think you\u0027re doin\u0027?\" I ask her.\n \"Getting you back for kidnapping me.\" She steps back and with all her might whips my keys into the woods.\n \"You did not just do that.\"\n She backs up, facing me the entire time, as she moves toward her car. \"No hard feelings. Payback\u0027s a bitch, ain\u0027t it, Alex?\" she says, trying to keep a straight face.\n I watch in shock as my chem partner gets into her Beemer. The car drives out of the lot without a jolt, jerk, or hitch. Flawless start.\n I\u0027m pissed off because I\u0027m going to have to either crawl around in the dark woods trying to find my keys or call Enrique to pick me up.\n I\u0027m also amused. Brittany Ellis bested me at my own game.\n \"Yeah,\" I say to her even though she\u0027s probably a mile away and can\u0027t hear me. \"Payback is a bitch.\"\n CHAPTER 25 Brittany\n The sound of my sister\u0027s heavy breathing beside me is the first thing I hear as early morning sunlight pours into her room. I\u0027d gone to Shelley\u0027s room and laid next to her for hours, watching her sleep peacefully before drifting off myself.\n When I was little, I would hurry to my sister\u0027s room whenever there was a thunderstorm. Not to comfort Shelley, but so she could comfort me. I would hold Shelley\u0027s hand and somehow my fears would fade.\n Watching my older sister sleep soundly, I can\u0027t believe my parents want to send her away. Shelley is a big part of who I am; the thought of living without her seems so--wrong. Sometimes I feel Shelley and I are connected in a way few people understand. Even when our parents can\u0027t figure out what Shelley is trying to say, or why she\u0027s so frustrated, I usually know.\n That\u0027s why it devastated me when she pulled my hair. I never really thought she\u0027d do it to me.\n But she did.\n \"I won\u0027t let them take you away,\" I say softly to my sleeping sister. \"I\u0027ll always protect you.\"\n I ease myself off Shelley\u0027s bed. There is no way I can spend time with Shelley without her suspecting I\u0027m upset. So I get dressed and leave the house before she wakes up.\n I confided in Alex yesterday and the sky didn\u0027t fall. I actually felt better after telling him about Shelley. If I can do it with Alex, surely I can try it with Sierra and Darlene.\n As I sit in front of Sierra\u0027s house in my car, my thoughts turn to my life.\n Nothing is going right. Senior year is supposed to be a blast--easy and fun. So far it\u0027s been anything but. Colin is pressuring me, a guy in a gang is more than my chemistry partner, and my parents are going to send my sister far from Chicago. What else can go wrong?\n I notice movement coming from Sierra\u0027s second-story window. First legs, then a butt. Oh, God, it\u0027s Doug Thompson trying to jump to the trellis.\n Doug must see me, because Sierra\u0027s head pops out of the window. She waves and motions for me to wait.\n Doug\u0027s foot still hasn\u0027t reached the trellis. Sierra is holding onto his hand to steady him. He finally reaches the thing, but the flowers distract him and he falls, flinging his body in all directions. He\u0027s fine, though, I realize after he gives Sierra a thumbs-up before jogging off.\n I wonder if Colin would climb trellises for me.\n Sierra\u0027s front door opens three minutes later and she steps out in her underwear and tank top. \"Brit, what are you doing here? It\u0027s seven o\u0027clock. In the morning. You do realize it\u0027s a teacher in-service and we have no school.\"\n \"I know, but my life is spinning out of control.\"\n \"Come inside and we\u0027ll talk,\" she says, opening my car door. \"I\u0027m freezing my butt off here. Oh, why don\u0027t the Chicago summers last longer?\"\n Inside, I take off my shoes so I won\u0027t wake up her parents.\n \"Don\u0027t worry, they left for the health club an hour ago.\"\n \"Then why was Doug escaping out your window?\"\n Sierra winks. \"You know, to keep the relationship exciting. Guys love adventure.\"\n I follow Sierra into her spacious bedroom. It\u0027s decorated in fuchsia and apple green, the colors her mother\u0027s decorator picked out for her. I plunk myself down on the extra bed as Sierra calls Darlene. \"Dar, come over. Brit\u0027s in crisis mode.\"\n Darlene, in her pj\u0027s and slippers, arrives a few minutes later since she lives only two houses down.\n \"Okay, spill,\" Sierra demands when we\u0027re all together.\n Suddenly, with all eyes on me, I\u0027m not so sure this sharing thing is such a good idea. \"It\u0027s not really anything.\"\n Darlene straightens. \"Listen, Brit. You got me out of bed at seven a.m. Dish the dirt.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Sierra says. \"We\u0027re your friends. If you can\u0027t share with your friends, who can you share with?\"\n Alex Fuentes. But I\u0027d never tell them that.\n \"Why don\u0027t we watch old movies,\" Sierra suggests. \"If Audrey Hepburn doesn\u0027t get you to spill your guts, nothing will.\"\n Darlene groans. \"I can\u0027t believe you got me up for a non-crisis and old movies. You guys seriously need to get a life. The least you can do is give me gossip. Anyone have any?\"\n Sierra leads us to the living room and we all sink into the cushions on her parents\u0027 sofa. \"I heard Samantha Jacoby was found kissing someone in the custodian closet on Tuesday.\"\n \" Whoop-de-doo,\" Darlene says, totally unimpressed.\n \"Did I mention it was Chuck, one of the custodians?\"\n \"Now that is good gossip, Sierra.\"\n Is that how it\u0027s going to be if I share anything, turning my misery into gossip for everyone to laugh about?\n In Sierra\u0027s living room four hours, two movies, popcorn, and a tub of Ben \u0026 Jerry\u0027s Confection Connection ice cream later, I\u0027m feeling better. Maybe it was Audrey Hepburn as Sabrina, but somehow I think everything is possible. Which makes me think about . . .\n \"What do you guys think of Alex Fuentes?\" I ask.\n Sierra pops a piece of popcorn in her mouth. \"What do you mean \u0027what do we think of him?\u0027\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I say, unable to stop thinking about the intense, undeniable attraction that is always between us. \"He\u0027s my chemistry partner.\"\n \"And . . . ?\" Sierra urges, waving her hand in the air as if saying, \"So what\u0027s your point?\"\n I grab the remote control and pause the movie. \"He\u0027s hot. Admit it.\"\n \"Eww, Brit,\" Darlene says, pretending to stick her finger down her throat and gagging.\n Sierra says, \"Okay, so I admit he\u0027s cute. But he\u0027s not someone I would ever date. He\u0027s, you know, a gang member.\"\n \"Half the time he comes to school high,\" Darlene chimes in.\n \"I sit right next to him, Darlene, and I\u0027ve never noticed him high at school.\"\n \"Are you kidding, Brit? Alex does drugs before school, and in the guys\u0027 bathroom when he ditches study hall. And I\u0027m not just talking about pot. He\u0027s into the hard stuff,\" Darlene states like it\u0027s fact.\n \"Have you seen him do drugs?\" I challenge.\n \"Listen, Brit. I don\u0027t have to be in the room with him to know he snorts or shoots up. Alex is dangerous. Besides, girls like us don\u0027t mix with Latino Bloods.\"\n I lean into the plush cushions of the couch. \"Yeah, I know.\"\n \"Colin loves you,\" Sierra says, changing the subject.\n Love, I sense, is a far cry from what Colin felt for me at the beach, but I don\u0027t even want to go there.\n Three times my mom tries to contact me. First on my cell, although turning it off didn\u0027t deter her because she called Sierra\u0027s house twice.\n \"Your mom\u0027s coming over if you don\u0027t talk to her,\" Sierra says, the phone dangling from her fingers.\n \"If she does, I\u0027m leaving.\"\n Sierra hands me the phone. \"Me and Darlene are going outside so you can have some privacy. I don\u0027t know what this is all about, but talk to her.\"\n I hold the phone to my ear. \"Hello, Mother.\"\n \"Listen, Brittany, I know you\u0027re upset. We finalized the plans about Shelley last night. I know it\u0027s hard on you, but she\u0027s been more and more frustrated lately.\"\n \"Mom, she\u0027s twenty years old and gets upset when people can\u0027t understand her. Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s normal?\"\n \"You\u0027re going to college next year. It\u0027s not fair to keep her home anymore. Stop being so selfish.\"\n If Shelley is being sent away because I\u0027m going to college, it is my fault. \"You\u0027re going to do this no matter how I feel about it, aren\u0027t you?\" I ask.\n \"Yes. It\u0027s a done deal.\"\n CHAPTER 26 Alex\n When Brittany walks into Mrs. P.\u0027s class on Friday I\u0027m still thinking about how I\u0027m going to get back at her for throwing my keys into the woods last weekend. It took me forty-five minutes to find the suckers, and all the while I was cursing Brittany. Okay, so I give her props for dishing it out. I also have her to thank for helping me talk about the night of my papa\u0027s death. Because of it, I\u0027ve called older OG\u0027s in the Blood, asking them if they know who might have had a grudge against my dad.\n Brittany has been wary this whole week. She\u0027s waiting for me to play a joke on her, to get her back for tossing my keys into the woods. After school, as I\u0027m at my locker picking books to take home, she storms up to me wearing her sexy pom uniform.\n \"Meet me in the wrestling gym,\" she orders.\n Now I can do two things: meet her like she told me to or leave the school. I take my books and enter the small gym. Brittany is standing, holding out her keychain without keys dangling from it.\n \"Where have my keys magically disappeared to?\" she asks. \"I\u0027m going to be late for the game if you don\u0027t tell me. Ms. Small will kick me off the squad if I\u0027m not at the game.\"\n \"I tossed them somewhere. You know, you should really get a purse that has a zipper. You never know when someone will reach in and grab somethin\u0027.\"\n \"Glad to know you\u0027re a klepto. Wanna give me a hint as to where you\u0027ve hidden them?\"\n I lean against the wall of the wrestling gym, thinking about what people would think if they caught us in here together. \"It\u0027s in a place that\u0027s wet. Really, really wet,\" I say, giving her a clue.\n \"The pool?\"\n I nod. \"Creative, huh?\"\n She tries to push me into the wall. \"Oh, I\u0027m going to kill you. You better go get them.\"\n If I didn\u0027t know her better, I\u0027d think she was flirting with me. I think she likes this game we have going on. \"Mamacita, you should know me better than that. You\u0027re all on your own, like I was when you left me in the library parking lot.\"\n She cocks her head, gives me sad eyes, and pouts. I shouldn\u0027t concentrate on her pouty lips, it\u0027s dangerous. But I can\u0027t help it.\n \"Show me where they are, Alex. Please.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-20.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) \n A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers. \n When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \u0027perfect\u0027 life is about to unravel before her eyes.
