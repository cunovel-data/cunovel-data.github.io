{"id":86012,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Mario, a guy in my class whose brother died in a drive-by last year, slaps me on the back. \"Wanna play goalie, Alex?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I have what you call an offensive personality. In soccer, and in life.\\n\\n \"Paco, what about you?\"\\n\\n Paco agrees and takes his position, which is sitting on his ass in front of the goal line. As usual, my lazy friend sits until the ball rolls to his side of the field.\\n\\n Most of the guys playing are from my neighborhood. We\u0027ve grown up together . . . played on this playground since we were kids and even got initiated into the Latino Blood at the same time. Before I was jumped in I remember Lucky telling us how being in a gang was like having a second family ... a family who would be there for you when your own family wasn\u0027t. They would offer protection and security. It sounded perfect to a kid who\u0027d lost his father.\\n\\n Over the years, I\u0027ve learned to block out the bad stuff. The beatings, the dirty drug deals, the shootings. And I\u0027m not just talking about guys on the other side. I know of guys who tried to get out, guys who were found dead or beaten so badly by their own gang they probably wished they were dead.\\n\\n To be honest, I block it out \u0027cause it scares the shit out of me. I\u0027m supposed to be tough enough not to care, but I do.\\n\\n We take our positions on the field. I imagine the ball holds a jackpot. If I keep it away from everyone else and kick it into the goal, I\u0027ll magically transform into a rich and powerful guy who can take my family (and Paco) away from this hellhole neighborhood.\\n\\n There\u0027s a lot of good players on each team. The other side has an advantage because we have Paco as our goalie, scratching his balls on the other end of the field.\\n\\n \"Yo, Paco. Stop playin\u0027 with yourself!\" Mario yells.\\n\\n Paco\u0027s answer is making a huge point of grabbing his balls and juggling them in his hands. Chris shoots the ball right past him and scores.\\n\\n Mario picks up the ball from inside the goal and chucks it at Paco. \"If you were as interested in the game as you are in your huevos, they wouldn\u0027t have scored.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t help it if they itch, man. Your girlfriend must have given me crabs last night.\"\\n\\n Mario laughs, not believing for a second his girlfriend would cheat on him. Paco tosses the ball to Mario, who passes to Lucky. Lucky brings the ball downfield. He passes it to me and I have my chance. I dribble down the makeshift field, pausing only to gauge how far I have to go before I kick it into the goal.\\n\\n Faking to the left, I pass to Mario and he passes it back. With one swift kick, the ball soars right and we\u0027ve scored.\\n\\n \"Goooaaaallll,\" our team sings as Mario gives me a high five.\\n\\n Our celebration is short-lived, though. A blue Escalade is creeping suspiciously down the street.\\n\\n \"Recognize it?\" Mario asks, tensing.\\n\\n The game stops as guys realize there\u0027s something not cool. \"Maybe it\u0027s retaliation,\" I say.\\n\\n My eyes never leave the car window. When the car stops, we\u0027re all waiting for a glimpse of either someone or something to emerge from the car. When it does, we\u0027ll be ready.\\n\\n But I\u0027m not. My brother Carlos steps out of the car with a guy named Wil. Wil\u0027s ma is in the Blood and recruits new members. My brother better not be one of those recruits. I\u0027ve worked too damn hard making sure he knows I\u0027m in the Blood so he doesn\u0027t have to be. If one family member is in, the rest are protected. I\u0027m in. Carlos and Luis aren\u0027t, and I\u0027ll do anything to make sure they stay that way.\\n\\n I put on a game face and walk over to Wil, soccer completely forgotten. \"New car?\" I ask him, eyeing his wheels.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my mom\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Nice.\" I turn to my brother. \"Where have you guys been hangin\u0027?\"\\n\\n Carlos leans against the car, as if hanging with Wil is no big deal. Wil got initiated recently and now he thinks he\u0027s the shit. \"At the mall. They\u0027ve got this cool new guitar store. Hector met us there and--\"\\n\\n Did I hear right? \"Hector?\" The last thing I want is my brother hanging around Hector.\\n\\n Wil, with his big shirt hanging over his pants, whacks Carlos on the shoulder to shut him up. My brother closes his mouth as if something was about to fly in it. I swear I\u0027ll kick his ass from here to Mexico if he even thinks about joining the Blood.\\n\\n \"Fuentes, you in or out?\" someone yells from the field.\\n\\n Keeping my anger hidden, I turn to my brother and his friend, who\u0027s capable of luring him to the dark side. \"Wanna play?\"\\n\\n \"Nah. We\u0027re gonna hang at my house,\" Wil says.\\n\\n I shrug nonchalantly, not feeling the least bit nonchalant. Que me importa!\\n\\n I walk to the field, even if I have the urge to grab Carlos by the ear and drag him home. I can\u0027t afford to cause a scene that might get back to Hector, who might start questioning my loyalty.\\n\\n Sometimes I feel my life is one big lie.\\n\\n Carlos leaves with Wil. That, combined with the fact that I can\u0027t get Brittany out of my mind, is driving me nuts. On the field, when the game starts back up, I\u0027m restless. Suddenly, it\u0027s like the players on the other team aren\u0027t guys I know, but enemies in the way of everything I want. I charge the ball.\\n\\n \"Foul!\" a cousin of one of my friends yells at me when I slam into him.\\n\\n I put up my hands. \"That was not a foul.\"\\n\\n \"You pushed me.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be a panocha,\" I say, knowing I\u0027m blowing it out of proportion.\\n\\n I want to get in a fight. I\u0027m asking for it. He knows it. The guy is about my height, my weight. My adrenaline is running high.\\n\\n \"You want a piece of me, pendejo?\" he says, holding his arms out wide like a bird in flight.\\n\\n Intimidation doesn\u0027t work with me. \"Come and get it.\"\\n\\n Paco runs in between us. \"Alex, cool down, man.\"\\n\\n \"Either fight or play!\" someone shouts.\\n\\n \"He said I made a foul,\" I tell Paco, my veins pumping.\\n\\n Paco shrugs casually. \"You did.\"\\n\\n Okay, now when my own best friend doesn\u0027t back me up, I know I\u0027ve lost it. I look around. Everyone is waiting to see what I\u0027m going to do. My adrenaline is in overdrive, matching their heightened anticipation. Do I want to fight? Yeah, if only to get this raw energy out of my body. And to forget, even for a minute, that my chem partner\u0027s number is cued up in my cell. And my brother is on the Blood radar to be recruited.\\n\\n My best friend shoves me away from the guy wanting to rip my head off and pushes me to the side of the field. He calls out for subs to take our place in the game.\\n\\n \"What\u0027d you do that for?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"To save your hide, man. Alex, you\u0027ve lost it. Completely.\"\\n\\n \"I can take that guy.\"\\n\\n Paco looks straight at me and says, \"You\u0027re the one actin\u0027 like a panocha.\"\\n\\n I shrug his hands off my shirt and stalk off not knowing how, in the matter of a few weeks, I\u0027ve gotten my life screwed up so badly. I need to fix it. I\u0027ll deal with Carlos when he comes home tonight. He\u0027s gonna get an earful from me. And Brittany . . .\\n\\n She didn\u0027t want me to drive her home from Isa\u0027s house because she didn\u0027t want to be seen with me. Fuck that shit. Carlos isn\u0027t the only one who deserves an earful from me.\\n\\n I flip open my cell and cue Brittany\u0027s number.\\n\\n \"Hello?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Alex,\" I tell her, although she has caller ID and knows damn well it\u0027s me. \"Meet me at the library. Now.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n This is not the Brittany Ellis Show. It\u0027s the Alex Fuentes Show now. \"Here\u0027s the deal, mamacita,\" I say as I reach my house and straddle my motorcycle. \"You either show up at the library in fifteen minutes or I\u0027m bringin\u0027 five friends to your house and we\u0027re campin\u0027 out on your front lawn tonight.\"\\n\\n \"How dare you--\" she starts to say, but I close the phone before she can finish her sentence.\\n\\n Revving the engine to block out thoughts of last night when she snuggled into my lap, I realize I don\u0027t have a game plan.\\n\\n I wonder if the Alex Fuentes Show will end up being a comedy or, more likely, a tragedy. Either way, it\u0027ll be a reality show worth not missing.\\n\\n CHAPTER 23 Brittany\\n\\n I\u0027m steaming mad as I pull into the library parking lot and park next to the woods at the far end of the lot. The last thing on my mind is our chemistry project.\\n\\n Alex is waiting for me, leaning against his motorcycle. I take the keys out of the ignition and storm over to him. \"How dare you order me around!\" I yell. My entire life is full of people trying to control me. My mom . . . Colin. And now Alex. I\u0027m done with it. \"If you think you can threaten me into--\"\\n\\n Without saying anything Alex snatches my keys out of my hand and sits in the driver\u0027s seat of my Beemer.\\n\\n \"Alex, what do you think you\u0027re doing?\"\\n\\n \"Get in.\"\\n\\n The engine roars. He\u0027s going to drive off and leave me stranded in the library parking lot.\\n\\n Clenching my fists, I stomp to the passenger side. When I\u0027m in, Alex revs the engine.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s my picture of Colin?\" I ask, eyeing my dashboard. It was taped up there a minute ago.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll get it back. I don\u0027t have the stomach to look at it while I\u0027m drivin\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"Do you even know how to drive a stick?\" I bark out.\\n\\n Without blinking or looking down, he puts the car into first gear and the car screeches out of the lot. My Beemer follows his lead as if the car and Alex are completely in sync.\\n\\n \"This is carjacking, you know.\" Silence. \"And kidnapping,\" I add.\\n\\n We\u0027re stopped at a light. I look at the cars around us, glad the top is up so no one can see us.\\n\\n \"Mira, you got in on your own free will,\" he says.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my car. What if someone sees us?\"\\n\\n My words really piss him off, because the tires screech angrily when the light turns green. He\u0027s purposely ruining my car.\\n\\n \"Stop it!\" I order. \"Take me back to the library.\"\\n\\n But he doesn\u0027t. He\u0027s silent as he winds my car through unknown towns and deserted roads, just like people do in the movies when they drive to meet dangerous drug dealers.\\n\\n Great. I\u0027m going on my first drug deal. If I get arrested, will my parents come bail me out? I wonder how my mom\u0027s going to explain that one to her friends. Maybe they\u0027ll send me away to some military boot camp for delinquents. I bet they\u0027d like that. . . making Shelley go to a facility and me to boot camp.\\n\\n My life would suck even more.\\n\\n I will not be a part of anything illegal. I am the ruler of my destiny, not Alex. I grab the handle to the door. \"Let me out of here or I swear I\u0027m jumping out.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wearin\u0027 a seatbelt.\" He rolls his eyes. \"Relax. We\u0027ll be there in two minutes.\" He shifts into a lower gear and slows the car as we enter an old, deserted airport. \"Okay, we\u0027re here,\" he says as he pulls up the parking brake.\\n\\n \"Yeah, okay. But where is here? I hate to tell you but the last inhabited place was, like, three miles back. I\u0027m not getting out of the car, Alex. You can do your drug deals on your own.\"\\n\\n \"If I had any doubts you were a true blond, you\u0027ve squelched them,\" he says. \"As if I\u0027d take you on a drug deal. Get out of the car.\"\\n\\n \"Give me one good reason why I should?\"\\n\\n \"Because if you don\u0027t, I\u0027m gonna drag you out. Trust me, mujer.\"\\n\\n He puts my keys in his back pocket and steps out of my car. Seeing no other options, I follow him. \"Listen, if you wanted to discuss our hand warmers we could have done it over the phone.\"\\n\\n He meets me around the back of my car. We\u0027re standing, toe to toe, in the middle of nowhere. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-18.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) \\n A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers. \\n When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \u0027perfect\u0027 life is about to unravel before her eyes.
