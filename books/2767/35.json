{"id":86029,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\"Come and fight me, geek,\" Sam calls out.\n I step forward, getting in the middle. \"Sam, what\u0027s your problem?\"\n \"This pendejo took my parkin\u0027 spot,\" Sam says, pointing past me to White Guy.\n \"So what? Did you find another spot?\"\n Sam stands stiffly, ready to kick White Guy\u0027s ass. Sam can do it, no problem.\n \"Yeah, I found another spot.\"\n \"Then leave the guy alone. I know him. He\u0027s cool.\"\n Sam raises an eyebrow. \"You know this guy?\"\n \"Listen,\" I say, taking one look at White Guy and am glad he\u0027s wearing a blue button-down instead of his coral shirt. It\u0027s still geek city, but at least I can keep a straight face when I say, \"This guy\u0027s been in jail more times than me. He might look like a complete pendejo, but underneath that fucked-up hair and lame shirt he\u0027s a complete badass.\"\n \"You\u0027re fuckin\u0027 with me, Alex,\" Sam says.\n I step out of the way and shrug. \"Don\u0027t say I didn\u0027t warn you.\"\n White Guy steps forward, attempting to look tough. I bite my lower lip to keep from laughing and cross my arms around my chest as if waiting for the ass-kicking to start. My LB buddies also wait, ready to see Sam get his ass kicked by a white geek.\n Sam looks from Alex to White Guy and back. \"If you\u0027re fuckin\u0027 with me, Alex--\"\n \"Check his police record. Grand theft auto is his specialty.\"\n Sam contemplates his next move. White Guy doesn\u0027t wait. He walks over to me, holding out his fist. \"You need anything, Alex, you know who\u0027s got your back.\"\n My fist connects with White Guy\u0027s. He\u0027s gone a second later and I\u0027m thankful nobody noticed his fist shaking in fear.\n I catch White Guy at his locker between first and second period. \"Did you mean it? That if I needed anythin\u0027 you\u0027d help?\"\n \"After this morning, I owe you my life,\" White Guy says. \"I don\u0027t know why you stuck up for me, but I was scared shitless.\"\n \"That\u0027s rule number one. Don\u0027t let them see you scared shitless.\"\n White Guy snorts. I guess it\u0027s his laugh--either that or he has a really bad sinus infection. \"I\u0027ll try and remember that the next time a gang member threatens my life.\" He holds out his hand for me to shake. \"I\u0027m Gary Frankel.\"\n I grab his hand and give it a shake. \"Listen, Gary,\" I say. \"My court date is next week and I\u0027d rather not rely on a public defender. You think your mom can help?\"\n Gary smiles. \"I think so. She\u0027s really good. If it\u0027s your first offense, she could probably get you a short probation.\"\n \"I can\u0027t afford--\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about the money, Alex. Here\u0027s her card. I\u0027ll tell her you\u0027re a friend of mine and she\u0027ll do it pro bono.\"\n As Gary walks down the hallway, I think of how funny it is that the most unlikely person sometimes becomes your ally. And how a blond girl can make you think futures are something to look forward to.\n CHAPTER 45 Brittany\n After the game on Saturday afternoon, a game we won due to Doug\u0027s touchdown pass with four seconds to go in the game, I\u0027m talking to Sierra and the M-factors on the side of the field. We\u0027re trying to figure out where we want to go celebrate the victory.\n \"How about Lou Malnati\u0027s?\" Morgan calls out.\n Everyone agrees, because it\u0027s the best pizza place in town. Megan is on a diet and is craving their special house salad, so it\u0027s a done deal.\n As we\u0027re figuring out the logistics, I look over at Isabel talking to Maria Ruiz. I walk over to them. \"Hey, guys,\" I say. \"You want to come to Lou Malnati\u0027s with us?\"\n Maria\u0027s eyebrows are furrowed in confusion. Isabel\u0027s aren\u0027t, though. \"Sure,\" Isabel says.\n Maria looks from Isabel to me, then back. She says something to Isabel in Spanish, then says she\u0027ll meet us at the restaurant.\n \"What did she say?\"\n \"She wanted to know why you\u0027d ask us to hang with you and your friends.\"\n \"What did you tell her?\"\n \"I told her that I\u0027m one of your friends, although as a hint my friends call me Isa, not Isabel.\"\n I lead her over to the rest of my friends, then look over at Sierra, who admitted to being jealous of my friendship with Isabel not too long ago. But instead of acting cold, she smiles at Isabel and asks her to show her how she does the double back flip in one of our routines. It just reinforces why she\u0027s my best friend. Madison seems as stunned as Maria was when I inform everyone that Maria and Isabel will be joining us at Lou Malnati\u0027s, but she doesn\u0027t say anything.\n Maybe, just maybe, this is a small step toward what Dr. Aguirre calls \"bridging the gap.\" I\u0027m not naive enough to think I can change Fairfield overnight, but over the past weeks my perceptions of certain people have changed. I hope their perceptions of me have changed, too.\n At the restaurant, I\u0027m sitting next to Isabel. A bunch of guys from the football team have come in, so the restaurant has been taken over by Fairfield High students. Darlene walks in with Colin. He\u0027s got his arm around her as if they\u0027re a couple.\n Sierra, on the other side of me, says, \"Tell me she doesn\u0027t have her hand in his back pocket. That is so lame.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care,\" I tell her, easing any worries she might have about me being upset. \"If they want to date, all the more power to them.\"\n \"She\u0027s only doing it because she wants everything you had. It\u0027s a competition thing with her. First taking your position on the squad, now putting her claws into Colin. Next thing you know she\u0027ll want to change her name to Brittany.\"\n \"Very funny.\"\n \"You say that now,\" she says, then moves in close and whispers, \"it won\u0027t be so funny if she wants Alex next.\"\n \"Now that\u0027s not funny.\"\n Doug walks in and Sierra waves him over. He can\u0027t squeeze into a chair so Sierra gives up her seat then sits on his lap. They start making out, and that\u0027s my cue to turn away and talk to Isabel.\n \"How are things progressing with you-know-who?\" I ask, knowing I can\u0027t bring up Paco\u0027s name because she doesn\u0027t want Maria to know she has the hots for him.\n She sighs. \"They\u0027re not.\"\n \"Why not? Didn\u0027t you have the talk with him like I told you to?\"\n \"No. He\u0027s been acting like a pendejo, completely ignoring the fact that we got together that one night. I\u0027m thinking he doesn\u0027t bring it up because he doesn\u0027t want it to go farther.\"\n I think of me breaking up with Colin and going for it with Alex. Every time I break out of what is expected of me and finally do what feels right, I feel stronger. \"Take a risk, Isa. I guarantee it\u0027s worth it.\"\n \"You just called me Isa.\"\n \"I know. Is that okay?\"\n She pushes my shoulder playfully. \"Yeah, Brit. It\u0027s fine.\"\n Talking to Isa about Paco makes me feel adventurous, and feeling adventurous makes me think of Alex. As soon as we\u0027re done eating, and everyone starts leaving, I call Alex on my cell as I\u0027m walking to my car. \"Do you know where Club Mystique is?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"Meet me there tonight at nine.\"\n \"Why? What\u0027s up?\"\n \"You\u0027ll see,\" I say, then hang up but realize Darlene is right behind me. Did she hear me talking to Alex?\n \"Hot date tonight?\" she asks.\n That answers my question. \"What have I done to you to make you hate me so much? We\u0027re friends one minute, and the next I feel you\u0027re plotting against me.\"\n Darlene shrugs, then flips her hair back. The gesture alone is a sign I can no longer consider her my friend. \"I guess I\u0027m sick of living in your shadow, Brit. It\u0027s time to give up your reign. You\u0027ve played Fairfield High\u0027s princess for so long. It\u0027s time to give someone else a chance to be in the spotlight.\"\n \"You can have the spotlight. Enjoy it,\" I tell her. She has no clue I never wanted it in the first place. If anything, I just used the spotlight to enhance the show I put on for everyone else.\n When I get to Club Mystique at nine, Alex sneaks up behind me outside. I turn around and wrap my arms around his neck.\n \"Whoa, girl,\" he says, taken aback. \"I thought we were keepin\u0027 this thing between us a secret. I hate to tell you, but a bunch of north siders from Fairfield are right over there. And they\u0027re starin\u0027 at us.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care. Not anymore.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"You only live once.\"\n He seems to like my answer, because he takes my hand in his and leads me to the back of the line. It\u0027s cold outside, so he opens his leather jacket and envelopes me in his warmth while we wait to get in.\n I look up at him, our bodies pressed together. \"Are you going to dance with me tonight?\" I ask.\n \"Hell, yeah.\"\n \"Colin never wanted to dance with me.\"\n \"I\u0027m not Colin, querida, and never will be.\"\n \"Good. I\u0027ve got you, Alex. I realize it\u0027s all I need and I\u0027m ready to share it with the world.\"\n Inside the club, Alex immediately heads for the dance floor with me. I ignore the gawking stares from Fairfield students from my side of town as I pull Alex close to me and we move as one to the beat.\n We move together as if we\u0027ve been a couple forever, every movement in sync with each other. For the first time I\u0027m not afraid of what people think of me and Alex together. Next year, in college, it won\u0027t matter who came from what side of town.\n Troy, a boy I danced with the last time I came to Club Mystique, taps me on the shoulder as the music makes the dance floor vibrate. \"Who\u0027s the new stud?\" he asks.\n \"Troy, this is my boyfriend, Alex. Alex, this is Troy.\"\n \"Hey, man,\" Alex says as he holds out his hand and quickly shakes Troy\u0027s.\n \"I have a feeling this guy won\u0027t make the same mistake the other one did,\" Troy says to me.\n I don\u0027t answer, because I feel Alex\u0027s hands around my waist and back and it feels so right to have him here with me. I think he liked me calling him my boyfriend, and it felt so good to say it out loud. I lean my back against his chest and close my eyes, letting the rhythm of the music and the movement of our bodies mold together.\n After we\u0027ve been dancing awhile and need a breather, we walk off the dance floor. I whip out my cell and say, \"Pose for me.\"\n The first picture I take is of him trying to pose like a cool bad boy. It makes me laugh. I take another one before he can strike a pose this time.\n \"Let\u0027s take one of the both of us,\" he says, pulling me close. I press my cheek against his while he takes my cell and puts it as far away as he can reach, then freezes this perfect moment with a click. After the picture is taken, he pulls me into his arms and kisses me.\n Leaning against Alex, I scan the crowd. On the first floor, right by the balcony, is Colin--the last person I thought would be here. Colin hates it here; he hates to dance.\n His angry eyes meet mine, then he makes a big show of kissing the girl standing next to him. It\u0027s Darlene. And she\u0027s kissing him back with all she\u0027s got while he grabs her butt and grinds against her. She knew I\u0027d be here tonight with Alex, and she obviously planned this.\n \"You want to go?\" Alex asks as he catches sight of Colin and Darlene.\n I turn to face him and once again I\u0027m breathless just looking at his beautiful, strong features. \"Nope. But it\u0027s so hot in here. Take off your jacket.\"\n He hesitates before saying, \"I can\u0027t.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n He winces. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-35.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) \n A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers. \n When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \u0027perfect\u0027 life is about to unravel before her eyes.
