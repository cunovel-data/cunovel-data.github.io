You know, the Golden Couple. Get it?\" I stare at her in disbelief. That is beyond fucked up. \"I get it. I just can\u0027t believe I\u0027m hearin\u0027 it. Does bein\u0027 perfect mean that much to you?\" There\u0027s a long, brittle silence. I catch a flicker of sadness in those sapphire eyes, but then it\u0027s gone. In an instant her expression stills and grows serious. \"I haven\u0027t been doing a bang-up job at it lately, but yes. It does,\" she finally admits. \"My sister isn\u0027t perfect, so I have to be.\" That is the most pathetic shit I\u0027ve ever heard. I shake my head in disgust and point to Julio. \"Get on and I\u0027ll take you back to school to get your car.\" Silently, Brittany straddles my motorcycle. She holds herself so far away from me I can barely feel her behind me. I almost take a detour to make the ride last longer. She treats her sister with patience and adoration. God knows I wouldn\u0027t be able to spoon-feed one of my brothers and wipe his mouth. The girl I once accused of being self-absorbed is not one-dimensional. Dios mio, I admire her. Somehow, being with Brittany brings something to my life that\u0027s missing, something ... right. But how am I going to convince her of that? CHAPTER 33 Brittany I\u0027m going to forget the kiss with Alex happened even though I was up all night replaying it in my head. As I\u0027m driving to school the day after the kiss that never happened, I wonder if I should ignore Alex. Although that\u0027s not an option because we have chemistry together. Oh, no. Chemistry class. Will Colin suspect something? Maybe someone saw us drive off together yesterday and told him. Last night I turned off my cell so I didn\u0027t have to talk to anyone. Ugh. I wish my life wasn\u0027t so complicated. I have a boyfriend. Okay, so my boyfriend\u0027s been acting pushy lately, interested only in sex. And I\u0027m sick of it. But Alex as my boyfriend would never work. His mom already hates me. His ex-girlfriend wants to kill me--another bad sign. He even smokes, which is totally not cool. I could make a huge list of all the negatives. Okay, so there might be some positives. A few minor ones too insignificant to mention. He\u0027s smart. He has eyes so expressive they give a hint to more than what he portrays. He\u0027s dedicated to his friends, family, and even his motorcycle. He touched me as if I were made of glass. He kissed me as if he\u0027d savor it for the rest of his life. The first time I see him is during lunch. As I\u0027m waiting in the cafeteria food line, Alex is two people in front of me. This girl, Nola Linn, is in between us. And she\u0027s not moving down the line fast enough. Alex\u0027s jeans are faded and torn at the knee. His hair is falling into his eyes and I\u0027m itching to push it back. If Nola wouldn\u0027t be so wishy-washy about her choice of fruit . . . Alex caught me checking him out. I quickly focus my attention on the soup of the day. Minestrone. \"Want a cup or bowl, hon?\" Mary, the lunch lady, asks me. \"Bowl,\" I say, pretending to be totally interested in the way she ladles the soup into the bowl. After she hands it to me, I hurry past Nola and stand by the cashier. Right behind Alex. As if he knows I\u0027m stalking him, he turns around. His eyes pierce mine and for a moment I feel as if the rest of the world is closed out and it\u0027s just the two of us. The urge to jump into his arms and feel the warmth of them surrounding me is so powerful, I wonder if it\u0027s medically possible to be addicted to another human being. I clear my throat. \"Your turn,\" I say, motioning to the cashier. He moves forward with his tray, a slice of pizza on it. \"I\u0027ll pay for hers, too,\" he says, pointing to me. The cashier waves her finger at me, \"What\u0027d you get? Bowl of minestrone?\" \"Yeah, but. . . Alex, don\u0027t pay for me.\" \"Don\u0027t worry. I can afford a bowl of soup,\" he says defensively, handing over three dollars. Colin barges into the line and stands next to me. \"Move along. Get your own girlfriend to stare at,\" he snaps at Alex, then shoos him off. I pray Alex doesn\u0027t retaliate by telling Colin we kissed. Everyone in line is watching us. I can feel their stares on the back of my neck. Alex takes his change from the cashier and without a backward glance heads for the outside courtyard off the cafeteria where he usually sits. I feel so selfish, because I want the best of both worlds. I want to keep the image I\u0027ve worked so hard to create. That image includes Colin. I also want Alex. I can\u0027t stop thinking about having him hold me again and kiss me until I\u0027m breathless. Colin says to the cashier, \"I\u0027ll pay for hers and mine.\" The cashier looks at me in confusion. \"Didn\u0027t that other boy pay for you already?\" Colin waits for me to correct her. When I don\u0027t, he gives me a disgusted look and stomps out of the cafeteria. \"Colin, wait!\" I say, but he either can\u0027t hear me or is ignoring me. The next time I see him is in chemistry class, but Colin walks in just as the bell rings so we don\u0027t talk. During chemistry, it\u0027s another experiment/observation. Alex swirls test tubes full of silver nitrate and potassium chloride liquids. \"Looks like they\u0027re both water to me, Mrs. P.,\" Alex says. \"Looks are deceiving,\" Mrs. Peterson replies. My gaze travels to Alex\u0027s hands. Those hands that are now busy measuring the right amount of silver nitrate and potassium chloride are the same ones that traced my lips intimately. \"Earth to Brittany.\" I blink my eyes, snapping out of my daydream. Alex is holding a test tube full of clear liquid out to me. Which reminds me I should help him pour the liquids together. \"Uh, sorry.\" I pick up one test tube and pour it into the tube he\u0027s holding. \"We\u0027re supposed to write down what happens,\" he says, using the stirring rod to mix the chemicals together. A white solid magically appears inside the clear liquid. \"Hey, Mrs. P.! I think we found the answer to our problems for the ozone layer depletion,\" Alex teases. Mrs. Peterson shakes her head. \"So what do we observe in the tube?\" he asks me, reading off of the sheet Mrs. Peterson handed out at the start of class. \"I\u0027d say the watery liquid is probably potassium nitrate now and the white solid mass is silver chloride. What\u0027s your assumption?\" As he hands me the tube, our fingers brush against each other. And linger. It leaves a tingling sensation I can\u0027t ignore. I glance up. Our eyes meet, and for a minute I think he\u0027s trying to send me a private message but his expression turns dark and he looks away. \"What do you want me to do?\" I whisper. \"You\u0027re gonna have to figure that one out yourself.\" \"Alex . . .\" But he won\u0027t tell me what to do. I guess I\u0027m a bitch to even ask him for advice when he can\u0027t possibly be unbiased. When I\u0027m close to Alex I feel excitement, the way I used to feel on Christmas morning. As much as I\u0027ve tried to ignore it, I look over at Colin and know . . . I know our relationship isn\u0027t what it used to be. It\u0027s over. And the sooner I break it off with Colin, the sooner I can stop wondering why I\u0027m still with him. I meet Colin after school by the back door to the school. He\u0027s dressed for football practice. Unfortunately Shane is standing next to him. Shane holds up his cell. \"You two want to do a repeat performance of the other night? I can capture the moment forever and e-mail it to you. It\u0027d be a great screen saver or, better yet, a You Tube video.\" \"Shane, get the fuck out of my sight before I lose it,\" Colin says, then gives Shane a stare until he leaves. \"Brit, where were you last night?\" When I don\u0027t answer, Colin says, \"You can save your breath, \u0027cause I already have a clue,\" This isn\u0027t going to be easy. I now know why people break up in e-mails and text messages. Doing it face-to-face is so hard because you have to stand in front of the person and witness their reaction. Face their wrath. I\u0027ve spent so much time avoiding arguments and smoothing relationships with the people around me, this confrontation is painful. \"You and I both know this isn\u0027t working,\" I say as gently as I can. Colin narrows his eyes at me. \"What are you saying?\" \"We need a break.\" \"A break, or a breakup?\" \"Breakup,\" I say gently. \"This is because of Fuentes, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Since you came back from summer break, our entire relationship is about fooling around. We never talk anymore, and I\u0027m sick of feeling guilty for not ripping my clothes off and spreading my legs to prove I love you.\" \"You don\u0027t want to prove anything to me.\" I keep my voice low so other students can\u0027t hear me. \"Why would you want me to? Just the fact that you need me to prove I love you is probably a clue it isn\u0027t working.\" \"Don\u0027t do this.\" He tosses his head back and moans. \"Please don\u0027t do this.\" We filled the football star/pom-pom captain stereotypical box everyone put us in. For years we fit the mold. Now we\u0027re going to be under a microscope for the breakup, with rumors swirling around us. Just the thought of it makes my skin crawl. But I can\u0027t pretend it\u0027s working anymore. The decision will probably haunt me. If my parents can send my sister away because it\u0027s good for them, and Darlene can fool around with every guy she comes in contact with because it makes her feel better, why can\u0027t I do what\u0027s right for me? I put my hand on Colin\u0027s shoulder, trying not to focus on his watering eyes. He shrugs my hand off. \"Say something,\" I urge. \"What do you want me to say, Brit? That I\u0027m thrilled you\u0027re breaking up with me? Sorry, but I\u0027m not feeling it.\" He wipes his eyes with his palms. It makes me want to cry, too, and my eyes start tearing. It\u0027s the end of something we thought was real but ended up being just another one of the roles we were thrust into. That\u0027s what makes me so sad. Not the breakup, but what our relationship stood for . . . my weakness. \"I had sex with Mia,\" he blurts out. \"This summer. You know, that girl in the picture.\" \"You\u0027re saying that to hurt me.\" \"I\u0027m saying it because it\u0027s the truth. Ask Shane.\" \"Then why did you come back here and pretend we were still the Golden Couple?\" \"Because that\u0027s what everyone expected. Even you. Don\u0027t deny it.\" His words sting, but they\u0027re the truth. Now I\u0027m done playing the \"perfect\" girl and living by everyone else\u0027s rules, including my own. It\u0027s time I start getting real. The first thing I do after Colin and I part is tell Ms. Small I need to take time off from poms. It feels like a weight is lifted off my shoulders. I go home, spend time with Shelley, and do homework. After dinner I call Isabel Avila. \"I should be surprised you\u0027re calling me. But I\u0027m not,\" she says. \"How was practice?\" \"Not great. Darlene isn\u0027t a great captain, and Ms. Small knows it. You shouldn\u0027t quit.\" \"I\u0027m not. I\u0027m just taking a break for a little while. But I didn\u0027t call to talk about poms. Listen, I wanted you to know I broke up with Colin today.\" \"And you\u0027re telling me because . . .\" That\u0027s a good question, one I normally wouldn\u0027t have answered. \"I wanted to talk with someone about it, and I know I have friends who I can call, but I kinda wanted to go to someone who wouldn\u0027t gossip about it. My friends have big mouths.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-26.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.
