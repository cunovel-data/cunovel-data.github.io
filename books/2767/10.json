{"id":86004,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\"No hay problema.\" Enrique clears his throat. \"You know, Hector was lookin\u0027 for you yesterday.\"\\n\\n Hector. Hector Martinez, the guy who runs the Latino Blood from behind the scenes. \"Sometimes I hate . . . you know.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re stuck in the Blood,\" Enrique says. \"Like the rest of us. Never let Hector hear you question your commitment to the Blood. If he suspects you\u0027re disloyal you\u0027ll become the enemy so fast your head\u0027ll spin. You\u0027re a smart kid, Alex. Play it safe.\"\\n\\n Enrique is an OG--an Original Gangster--because he\u0027d proven himself to the Latino Blood a long time ago. He paid his dues, so now he can sit back while the younger LB members are on the front lines. According to him, I\u0027ve just gotten my feet wet and have a long time to go before my friends and I get OG status.\\n\\n \"Smart? I bet my motorcycle I could get Brittany Ellis to sleep with me,\" I tell him.\\n\\n \"Scratch what I said.\" Enrique points to me with a smirk on his face. \"You\u0027re a dumbass. And you\u0027ll soon be a dumbass without a ride. Girls like that don\u0027t look at guys like us.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m beginning to think he\u0027s right. How the hell did I ever think I could lure the very beautiful, very rich, and very white Brittany Ellis into my very poor, very Mexican, and very dark life?\\n\\n Diego Vasquez, a guy from school, was born on the north side of Fairfield. Of course, my friends consider him a white guy even though his skin is darker than mine. They also think Mike Burns, a white guy who lives on the south side, is Mexican even though he doesn\u0027t have any Mexican blood in his body. Or Latino blood, for that matter. Yet he\u0027s considered one of us. In Fairfield, where you were born defines who you are.\\n\\n A horn beeps loudly in front of the garage.\\n\\n Enrique presses the button to raise the large garage door.\\n\\n Javier Moreno\u0027s car screeches inside. \"Close the door, Enrique,\" Javier orders breathlessly. \"La policia are lookin\u0027 for us.\"\\n\\n My cousin slams his fist on the button again and turns off the lights to the shop. \"What the hell did you guys do?\"\\n\\n Carmen is in the backseat, her eyes bloodshot from either drugs or alcohol; I can\u0027t tell which. And she\u0027s been messing around with whoever is back there with her, because I know all too well what Carmen looks like when she\u0027s been messing around.\\n\\n \"Raul tried to smoke a Satin Hood,\" Carmen slurs, sticking her head out of the car window. \"But he\u0027s got lousy aim.\"\\n\\n Raul turns to her and yells at her from the front passenger seat, \"Puta, you try and shoot a movin\u0027 target while Javier\u0027s driving.\"\\n\\n I roll my eyes as Javier steps out of the car. \"You dissin\u0027 my driving, Raul?\" he says. \" \u0027Cause if you are, I have a fist here that I\u0027ll ram into your face.\"\\n\\n Raul steps out of the car. \"You want a piece of me, culero?\"\\n\\n I step in front of Raul and hold him back.\\n\\n \"Shit, guys. La policia are right outside.\" These are the first words out of Sam, the guy who Carmen must have been with tonight.\\n\\n Everyone in the garage ducks as the police shine their flashlights through the windows. I crouch behind a large tool drawer, holding my breath. The last thing I need is attempted murder on my record. I\u0027ve miraculously avoided getting arrested, but one day my luck is bound to run out.\\n\\n A gang member rarely avoids the cops. Or jail time.\\n\\n Enrique\u0027s face shows what he\u0027s thinking. He finally saved enough to open this shop, and now four high school punks could ruin his dream if anyone makes a sound. The cops will take my cousin, with his old LB tattoos on the back of his neck, in right along with the rest of us.\\n\\n And he\u0027ll be out of business within a week.\\n\\n The door to the shop jiggles. I wince and pray please be locked.\\n\\n The cops give up on the door, then shine their flashlights in the garage again. I wonder who tipped them off--nobody in this neighborhood would narc. A secret code of silence and affiliation keeps families safe.\\n\\n After what seems like forever, the cops drive away.\\n\\n \"Shit, that was close,\" Javier says.\\n\\n \"Too close,\" Enrique agrees. \"Wait ten minutes, then get outta here.\"\\n\\n Carmen steps out of the car--actually, trips out. \"Hiya, Alex. I missed you tonight.\"\\n\\n My gaze rests on Sam. \"Yeah, I see how much you missed me.\"\\n\\n \"Sam? Oh, I don\u0027t really like him,\" she coos, coming close. I can smell the mota radiating off her. \"I\u0027m waiting for you to come back to me.\"\\n\\n \"Not gonna happen.\"\\n\\n \"Is it because of your stupid chemistry partner?\" She grabs ray chin, trying to force me to look at her, her long nails digging into my skin.\\n\\n I grab both her wrists and pull them aside, all the time wondering how my tough-as-nails ex-girlfriend turned into a tough-as-nails bitch. \"Brittany has nothin\u0027 to do with you and me. I hear you\u0027ve been talkin\u0027 shit to her.\"\\n\\n \"Did Isa tell you that?\" she asks, her eyes narrowed into slits.\\n\\n \"Just back off,\" I say, ignoring her question, \"or you\u0027ll have a lot more to deal with than a bitter ex-boyfriend.\"\\n\\n \"Are you bitter, Alex? Because you don\u0027t act bitter. You act like you don\u0027t give a shit.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s right. After I found her sleeping around, it took me a while to get over it, get over her. I wondered what other guys were giving her that I couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"I used to give a shit,\" I tell her. \"I don\u0027t now.\"\\n\\n Carmen slaps me. \"Fuck you, Alex.\"\\n\\n \"Lovers\u0027 quarrel?\" Javier drawls from the hood of the car.\\n\\n \"Collate,\" Carmen and I say simultaneously.\\n\\n Carmen whips around, stalks back to the car, and slides into the backseat. I watch as she pulls Sam\u0027s head toward her. The sounds of heavy kissing and moaning fill the auto shop.\\n\\n Javier calls out, \"Enrique, open the door. We\u0027re outta here.\"\\n\\n Raul, who\u0027d taken a leak in the bathroom, asks me, \"Alex, you comin\u0027? We need you, man. Paco and this Satin Hood are gonna fight at Gilson Park tonight. The Hood never fight fair, you know.\"\\n\\n Paco didn\u0027t tell me about the fight, probably because he knew I\u0027d try to talk him out of it. Sometimes my best friend gets into situations he can\u0027t get out of.\\n\\n And sometimes he exposes me to situations I can\u0027t help but get into.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in,\" I say, then jump into the front seat so Raul is stuck in back with the two lovebirds.\\n\\n We slow down a block before we reach the park. The tension in the air is thick, I can feel it in my bones. Where is Paco? Is he getting the shit kicked out of him in the back of an alley?\\n\\n It\u0027s dark. Shadows move, making my hair stand on end. Everything looks menacing, even the trees blowing in the wind. During the day, Gilson Park resembles any other suburban park . . . except for the LB graffiti on the buildings surrounding the park. This is our territory. We\u0027ve marked it.\\n\\n We\u0027re in the Chicago suburbs, ruling our \u0027hood and the streets that lead here. It\u0027s a street war, where other suburban gangs fight us for territory. Three blocks away are mansions and million-dollar houses. Right here, in the real world, the street war rages on. The people in the million-dollar houses don\u0027t even realize a battle is about to begin less than a half mile from their backyards.\\n\\n \"There he is,\" I say, pointing to two silhouettes standing a few feet away from the park swings. The streetlights shining on the park are out, but I can tell which one is Paco right away because of his short body and trademark stance resembling that of a wrestler about to start a match.\\n\\n As one silhouette pushes the other, I jump out of the car even though it\u0027s still moving. Because walking down the street are five more Hoods. Ready to fight with my best friend, I push away thoughts that this confrontation could end with all of us in the morgue. If I go into a fight with confidence and fire, without thinking of the consequences, I win. If I think too much about it, it\u0027ll be my doom.\\n\\n I rush toward Paco and the Satin Hood before the rest of his friends reach them. Paco is putting up a good fight, but the other guy is like a worm, squirming away from Paco\u0027s grasp. I roughly grab the Hood\u0027s shirt and pull him up, then my fists do the rest.\\n\\n Before he\u0027s able to stand and face me, I glare at Paco.\\n\\n \"I can take him, Alex,\" Paco says as he wipes blood off his lip.\\n\\n \"Yeah, but what about them?\" I say, my gaze focused on the five Hoods behind him.\\n\\n Now that I have a closer look, I realize these guys are all fresh. New members, full of piss and vinegar and not much else. New members I can take. But new members who pack heat are dangerous.\\n\\n Javier, Carmen, Sam, and Raul stand next to me. I have to admit we\u0027re an intimidating bunch, even Carmen. Our homegirl can hold her own in a fight, and her fingernails are downright deadly.\\n\\n The guy I pulled off Paco stands up and points to me. \"You\u0027re dead.\"\\n\\n \"Listen, enano,\" I say. Little guys hate when you make fun of their height and I can\u0027t resist. \"Go back to your own turf and leave this shit-hole to us.\"\\n\\n Enano points to Paco. \"He stole my steerin\u0027 wheel, man.\"\\n\\n I look over at Paco, knowing it\u0027s just like him to taunt a Satin Hood by stealing something so stupid. When I glance back at Enano, I notice he\u0027s now wielding a switchblade in his hand. And he\u0027s aiming it right at me.\\n\\n Oh, man. After I fight these Hoods, I\u0027m gonna kill my best friend.\\n\\n CHAPTER 13 Brittany\\n\\n My chemistry partner hasn\u0027t been in school since we received our projects. A week later he finally struts into class. It pisses me off, because no matter how bad my home life is, I come to school.\\n\\n \"Nice of you to show up,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Nice of you to notice,\" he says as he pulls off his bandanna.\\n\\n Mrs. Peterson walks into class. When she sees Alex, I think she seems relieved. Squaring her shoulders, she says, \"I was going to give you a pop quiz today. But instead I\u0027ll have you work with your partners in the library. Rough outlines are due in two weeks.\"\\n\\n Colin and I hold hands as we walk to the library. Alex is behind us somewhere, talking with his friends in Spanish.\\n\\n Colin squeezes my hand. \"Wanna get together after practice?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t. After poms I have to go home.\"\\n\\n Baghda quit on Saturday and my mom freaked out. Until she hires someone else I have to help out more.\\n\\n He stops and pulls his hand from mine. \"Shit, Brit. You gonna make some time for me, or what?\"\\n\\n \"You can come over,\" I offer.\\n\\n \"So I can watch you take care of your sister? No thanks. Not to be a prick, but I want alone time . . . just you and me.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I do, too.\"\\n\\n \"What about Friday?\"\\n\\n I should be with Shelley, but my relationship with Colin is rocky and I can\u0027t let him think I don\u0027t want to be with him. \"Friday works for me.\"\\n\\n Before we seal our plans with a kiss, Alex clears his throat in front of us. \"No PDA. School rules. Besides, she\u0027s my partner, dickhead. Not yours.\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Fuentes,\" Colin mutters, then joins Darlene.\\n\\n I put my hand on my hip and glare at Alex. \"Since when are you so concerned with school rules?\"\\n\\n \"Since you became my chem partner. Outside chemistry, you\u0027re his. In chemistry, you\u0027re mine.\"\\n\\n \"Want to find your club and pull me by my hair into the library?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a Neanderthal. Your boyfriend is the ape, not me.\"\\n\\n \"Then stop acting like one.\" All of the work tables in the library are taken, so we\u0027re forced to find a corner in the back of the library in the secluded nonfiction section and sit on the carpet. I set my books down and realize Alex is staring at me, almost as if he stares long enough he might be able to see the real me. No chance of that because I hide my true self from everyone. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-10.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) \\n A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers. \\n When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \u0027perfect\u0027 life is about to unravel before her eyes.
