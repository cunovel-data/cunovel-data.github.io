{"id":86034,"no":40,"title":"Page 40","content":"If I\u0027d known . . . if I had any idea tonight would be \"the night\" . . . I would have been prepared. I guess I never wholeheartedly thought this would be a reality with Brittany. She reaches into her coat pocket and a dozen condom packages spill onto the blanket.\\n\\n \"You plannin\u0027 on makin\u0027 this an all-nighter?\"\\n\\n Embarrassed, she puts her hands over her face. \"I just grabbed a bunch.\"\\n\\n I remove her hands and touch my forehead to hers. \"I\u0027m jokin\u0027, Don\u0027t be shy with me.\"\\n\\n Slipping the jacket off her shoulders, I know I\u0027m going to hate leaving her tonight. I wish we could have an all-nighter. But wishes are only granted in fairy tales.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t. . . aren\u0027t you going to take your jeans off?\" she asks.\\n\\n \"Soon.\" I wish I could take my time and make this night last forever. It\u0027s like being in heaven and knowing the next stop is hell. I slowly trace kisses down her neck and shoulders.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a virgin, Alex. What if I do everything wrong?\"\\n\\n \"There is no wrong here. This isn\u0027t a test in Peterson\u0027s class. This is you and me. The rest of the world is shut out right now, okay?\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" she says softly. Her eyes are glistening. Is she crying?\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t deserve you. You know that, querida, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"When are you gonna realize you\u0027re one of the good guys?\" When I don\u0027t answer, she pulls my head down to hers. \"My body is yours tonight, Alex,\" she whispers against my lips. \"Do you want it?\"\\n\\n \"God, yes.\" As we make out, I shrug off my jeans and briefs and hug her tight, devouring the softness and warmth of her body against mine. \"Are you scared?\" I whisper in her ear when she\u0027s ready and I\u0027m ready and I can\u0027t wait any longer.\\n\\n \"A little, but I trust you.\"\\n\\n \"Relax, preciosa.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying.\"\\n\\n \"This won\u0027t work unless you relax.\" I pull away and reach for a condom, my hands shaking. \"You sure about this?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Yes, yes, I\u0027m sure. I love you, Alex,\" she says. \"I love you,\" she says again, saying it almost desperately this time.\\n\\n I let her words seep into my body and hold myself back, not wanting to hurt her. Who am I kidding? The first time for a girl hurts, no matter how careful a guy is.\\n\\n I want to tell her how I feel, tell her how much she\u0027s become the center of my being. But I can\u0027t. The words won\u0027t come.\\n\\n \"Just do it,\" she says, sensing my hesitation.\\n\\n So I do, but when she sucks in a breath, I just wish I could take the pain away from her.\\n\\n She sniffs and wipes a tear that\u0027s running down her cheek. Seeing her that emotional is my undoing. For the first time since I saw my dad lying dead in front of me, a tear drops from my eye.\\n\\n She holds my head in her hands and kisses my tear away. \"It\u0027s okay, Alex.\"\\n\\n But it\u0027s not. I need to make this perfect. Because I may never get another chance and she needs to know how good it can be.\\n\\n I focus on her completely, desperate to make it special. Afterward, I pull her close. She nestles into me while I stroke her hair, both of us content to stay in our private world for as long as possible.\\n\\n I can\u0027t believe she shared her body with me. I should feel victorious. Instead, me siento una mierda.\\n\\n It\u0027ll be impossible to protect Brittany for the rest of her life from all the other guys who want to be near her, to see her as I\u0027ve seen her. Touch her as I\u0027ve touched her. Man, I never want to let her go.\\n\\n But it\u0027s too late. I can\u0027t waste more time. After all, she isn\u0027t mine forever and I can\u0027t pretend she is. \"You okay?\" I ask her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine. More than fine.\"\\n\\n \"I really gotta go,\" I say, glancing at the digital clock sitting crooked on one of the tool carts.\\n\\n Brittany rests her chin on my chest. \"You\u0027re going to quit the Blood now, right?\"\\n\\n My body stiffens. \"No,\" I say, my voice filled with torment. Hell, why\u0027d she go and ask me that?\\n\\n \"Everything\u0027s different now, Alex. We made love.\"\\n\\n \"What we did was great. But it doesn\u0027t change anythin\u0027.\"\\n\\n She stands, collects her clothes, and starts dressing in the corner. \"So I\u0027m just another girl you can add to the list of girls you\u0027ve slept with?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t say that.\"\\n\\n \"Why not? It\u0027s true, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Then prove it to me, Alex.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t.\" I wish I could tell her something different. She has to know it\u0027ll always be like this, I\u0027ll have to leave her for the Blood time and time again. This white girl who loves with her heart and soul so intensely is like an addictive drug. She deserves better. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say after I step into my jeans. What else is there to say?\\n\\n She averts her eyes and walks to the garage\u0027s exit like a robot.\\n\\n When I hear tires screeching, my protective senses kick in. A car is heading our way . . . Lucky\u0027s RX-7.\\n\\n This is not good. \"Get in your car,\" I order.\\n\\n But it\u0027s too late; Lucky\u0027s RX carrying a bunch of guys from the Blood comes to a screeching halt in front of us.\\n\\n \"No lo puedo creer, ganaste la apuesta!\" Lucky yells out the window.\\n\\n I attempt to hide Brittany behind me, but it\u0027s no use. Plain as day they can spot her sexy, bare legs sticking out of her coat.\\n\\n \"What is he saying?\" she asks.\\n\\n I have the urge to take my pants off and give them to her. If she finds out about the bet, she\u0027ll think that\u0027s why I slept with her. I have to get her out of here fast.\\n\\n \"Nothin\u0027. He\u0027s trash talkin\u0027,\" J say. \"Get in the car. \u0027Cause if you don\u0027t I\u0027m gonna put you in there.\"\\n\\n I hear the creak of Lucky\u0027s car door at the same time Brittany opens hers.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be mad at Paco,\" she says, then slides into the driver\u0027s seat.\\n\\n What is she talking about? \"Go,\" I order, not having time to ask what she means. \"We\u0027ll talk later.\"\\n\\n She speeds away.\\n\\n \"Shit, man,\" Lucky says, eyeing the back of her BMW with appreciation. \"I had to find out if Enrique was shittin\u0027 me. You really did screw Brittany Ellis, didn\u0027t you? Did you videotape it?\"\\n\\n My answer is a savage punch to Lucky\u0027s gut, making him fall to his knees. I straddle my motorcycle and rev the engine. When I see Enrique\u0027s Camry, I stop by his car.\\n\\n \"Listen, Alejo,\" Enrique says to me through the open window. \"Lo siento mucho--\"\\n\\n \"I quit,\" I interrupt before throwing the keys to the shop at Enrique and riding away.\\n\\n As I drive home, my thoughts turn to Brittany and how much she means to me.\\n\\n The reality hits me.\\n\\n I\u0027m not doing the drug deal.\\n\\n Now I understand all those chick flicks I make fun of. \u0027Cause now I\u0027m the sappy dork willing to risk it all for the girl. Estoy enamorado . . . I\u0027m in love.\\n\\n Fuck the Blood. I can protect my family and be true to myself first. Brittany was right. My life is too important to throw away on a drug deal. The truth is, I want to apply to college and make something good out of my life.\\n\\n I\u0027m not like my father. My father was a weak man who took the easy way out. I\u0027ll take the challenge required to leave the Blood, forget the risk. And if I survive, I\u0027ll go back to Brittany a free man. ;Lo juro!\\n\\n I\u0027m not a drug dealer. I\u0027m letting Hector down, but my reasons for being in the gang were to help protect my neighborhood and family, not deal drugs. Since when did dealing become a necessity?\\n\\n Since I got pulled over, it snowballed from there. I got arrested, then Hector bailed me out. Right after I asked questions of other OG\u0027s about the night my father died, Hector and my mom got in a heated discussion. She had bruises on her. After that, Hector was all over me about the drug deal.\\n\\n Paco tried to warn me; he was convinced something wasn\u0027t right.\\n\\n Racking my brain, the pieces slowly come together. Dios, was the truth right in front of my face? There\u0027s one person who can tell me the truth about the night my dad died.\\n\\n I storm into my house and find mi\u0027ama in her room. \"You know who killed Papa.\"\\n\\n \"Alejandro, don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"It was someone in the Blood, wasn\u0027t it? The night at the wedding, Hector and you were talkin\u0027 about it. He knows who it is. You know, too.\"\\n\\n Tears start welling in her eyes. \"I\u0027m warning you, Alejandro. Don\u0027t do this.\"\\n\\n \"Who was it?\" I ask, ignoring her plea.\\n\\n She looks away from me.\\n\\n \"Tell me!\" I scream at the top of my lungs. My words make her flinch.\\n\\n For so long I just wanted to take the hurt away from her, I didn\u0027t think to ask what she knew about my father\u0027s murder. Or maybe I didn\u0027t want to know, because I was afraid of the truth. I can\u0027t let it go any longer.\\n\\n Her breathing is slow and jerky as she puts her hand to her mouth. \"Hector ... it was Hector.\" While the truth sinks in, dread, shock, and pain spread through my body like wildfire. My mom looks up at me with sad eyes. \"I just wanted to protect you and your brothers, That\u0027s all. Your papa wanted out of the Blood, and got killed for it. Hector wanted you to replace him. He threatened me, Alejandro, and said if you didn\u0027t get jumped in, the whole family would end up like your father--\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t listen anymore. Hector set me up to get arrested so I\u0027d owe him. And he set up the drug deal, duping me to think it\u0027s a step up when it was only a step into his trap. He probably suspected someone would spill the truth, and soon. I hurry to my dresser, my mind set on what I need to do--confront my father\u0027s killer.\\n\\n The gun is gone.\\n\\n \"Did you go in my drawer?\" I growl at Carlos, grabbing him by the collar as he\u0027s sitting on the living room couch.\\n\\n \"No, Alex,\" Carlos says. \"!Creeme! Paco was here earlier, and he went to our room, but he said it was just to borrow one of your jackets.\"\\n\\n Paco took my gun. I should have known. But how did Paco know I wouldn\u0027t be home to catch him?\\n\\n Brittany.\\n\\n Brittany stalled me tonight on purpose. She said not to be mad at Paco. They were both trying to protect me, because I was too stupid and cowardly to stick up for myself and face the facts that were right in front of my face.\\n\\n Brittany\u0027s words as she got in her car ring in my ears. Don\u0027t be mad at Paco.\\n\\n I hurry to mi\u0027ama\u0027s room. \"If I don\u0027t come back tonight, you\u0027ve got to take Carlos and Luis to Mexico,\" I tell her.\\n\\n \"But, Alejandro--\"\\n\\n I sit on the edge of her bed. \"Mama, Carlos and Luis are in danger. Save them from my fate. Please.\"\\n\\n \"Alex, don\u0027t talk like that. Your father talked like that.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m just like Papa, I want to say, and made the same mistakes. I won\u0027t let it happen to my brothers. \"Promise me. I need to hear you say it. I\u0027m dead serious.\"\\n\\n Tears are streaming down her face. She kisses my cheek and hugs me tight. \"I promise ... I promise.\"\\n\\n I hop on Julio and call someone I never thought I\u0027d call for advice--Gary Frankel. He urges me to do something I\u0027d never thought I\u0027d do--call the cops and inform them what\u0027s going down.\\n\\n CHAPTER 53 Brittany\\n\\n I\u0027ve been sitting in Sierra\u0027s driveway for five minutes. I still can\u0027t believe Alex and I did it. I don\u0027t regret a single minute of it, but I still don\u0027t believe it.\\n\\n Tonight I sensed desperation in Alex, though, as if he wanted to prove something to me through actions instead of words. I\u0027m mad at myself for getting emotional, but I couldn\u0027t help it. The tears streamed out from joy, happiness, love. And when I saw a tear escape from his eye, I kissed it. ... I wanted to save that tear forever because it was the first time Alex let me see him like that. Alex doesn\u0027t cry; he doesn\u0027t let himself get that emotional about anything. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-40.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) \\n A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers. \\n When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \u0027perfect\u0027 life is about to unravel before her eyes.
