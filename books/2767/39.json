Because if I was home alone, I\u0027d go nuts thinking about everything.\\n\\n My grip on the riveter in my hand loosens and it drops smack in the middle of my forehead. I don\u0027t get pissed off at myself, I blame Brittany. And by eight o\u0027clock I\u0027m as angry as anything with my little chem partner, whether it\u0027s warranted or not.\\n\\n CHAPTER 51 Brittany\\n\\n I\u0027m standing in front of Enrique\u0027s Auto Body, doing deep-breathing exercises to keep from being nervous. Enrique\u0027s Camry is nowhere in sight, so I know Alex is alone.\\n\\n I\u0027m going to seduce Alex.\\n\\n If what I\u0027m wearing doesn\u0027t capture his attention, nothing will. I\u0027m giving this my all. . . bringing out all the artillery. I rap on the door, then close my eyes tight and pray this goes as planned.\\n\\n I open my long, silver satin jacket and the cool night air rushes onto my exposed skin. When the creak of the door alerts me to Alex\u0027s presence, I slowly open my eyes. But it\u0027s not Alex\u0027s black eyes staring at my scantily clad body. It\u0027s Enrique--who\u0027s staring at my pink lace bra and pom-pom skirt as if he\u0027s won the lottery.\\n\\n Ripped with embarrassment, I wrap my coat around myself. If I could wrap it around twice, I would.\\n\\n \"Uh, Alex,\" Enrique laughs. \"There\u0027s a trick-or-treater here to see you.\"\\n\\n My face is probably beet red, but I\u0027m determined to see this through. I\u0027m here to show Alex I\u0027m not going to desert him.\\n\\n \"Who is it?\" comes Alex\u0027s voice from somewhere inside the garage.\\n\\n \"I was just leavin\u0027,\" Enrique says, slipping past me. \"Tell Alex to lock up. Adios.\"\\n\\n Enrique walks across the darkened street, humming to himself.\\n\\n \"Yo, Enrique. ;Quien esta ahi?\" Alex\u0027s voice fades when he reaches the front of the shop. He looks at me with contempt. \"Need directions or your car fixed?\"\\n\\n \"None of the above,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Trick-or-treatin\u0027 on my side of town?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s over, mujer. ;Me oyes? Why do you keep droppin\u0027 into my life and fuckin\u0027 with my head? Besides, aren\u0027t you supposed to be at the Halloween dance with some college guy?\"\\n\\n \"I blew him off. Can we talk?\"\\n\\n \"Listen, I\u0027ve got a shitload of work that still needs to get done. What did you come here for? And where\u0027s Enrique?\"\\n\\n \"He, uh, left,\" I say nervously. \"I think I scared him away.\"\\n\\n \"You? I don\u0027t think so.\"\\n\\n \"I showed him what I was wearing under my coat.\"\\n\\n Alex\u0027s eyebrows shoot up.\\n\\n \"Let me in before I freeze out here. Please.\" I look behind me. The darkness seems inviting right now as my blood pumps harder. Pulling the coat tighter around me, my skin puckers with goose bumps. I shiver.\\n\\n Sighing, he leads me into the body shop and locks the door. There\u0027s a space heater in the middle of the shop, thank goodness. I stand by it and rub my hands together.\\n\\n \"Listen, truth is I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here. But didn\u0027t we break up?\"\\n\\n \"I want to give us another try. Pretending we\u0027re just chemistry partners in class has been torture. I miss you. Don\u0027t you miss me?\"\\n\\n He looks skeptical. His head is cocked to the side, as if he\u0027s not quite sure he\u0027s hearing correctly. \"You know I\u0027m still in the Blood.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I\u0027ll take whatever you can give me, Alex.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll never be able to meet your expectations.\"\\n\\n \"What if I tell you I won\u0027t have any expectations?\"\\n\\n He takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. I can tell he\u0027s thinking hard about this, because his expression turns serious. \"I\u0027ll tell you what,\" he says. \"You keep me company while I finish my dinner. I won\u0027t even ask you what you have ... or don\u0027t have . . . under that coat. Deal?\"\\n\\n I smile tentatively and smooth down my hair. \"Deal.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to do that for me,\" he says, gently taking my hand away from my hair. \"I\u0027ll get a blanket so you don\u0027t get dirty.\"\\n\\n I wait until he pulls a clean light green fleece blanket out of a closet.\\n\\n We sit on the blanket and Alex looks at his watch. \"Want some?\" he asks, pointing to his dinner.\\n\\n Maybe eating will calm my nerves. \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"Enchiladas. Mi\u0027ama makes kick-ass enchiladas.\" He stabs a small portion with a fork and holds it out to me. \"If you\u0027re not used to this kind of spicy food--\"\\n\\n \"I love spicy,\" I interrupt, taking it into my mouth. I start chewing, enjoying the blend of flavors. But when I swallow, my tongue slowly catches on fire. Somewhere behind all the fire there\u0027s flavor, but the flames are in the way.\\n\\n \"Hot,\" is all I can say as I attempt to swallow.\\n\\n \"I told you.\" Alex holds out the cup he\u0027d been drinking from. \"Here, drink. Milk usually does the trick, but I only have water.\"\\n\\n I grab the cup. The liquid cools my tongue, but when I finish the water it\u0027s as if someone stokes it again. \"Water . . . ,\" I say.\\n\\n He fills another cup. \"Here, drink more, though I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll help much. It\u0027ll subside soon.\"\\n\\n Instead of drinking it this time, I stick my tongue in the cold liquid and keep it there. Ahhh . . .\\n\\n \"You okay?\"\\n\\n \"To I wook otay?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"With your tongue in the water like that, actually, it\u0027s erotic. Want another bite?\" he asks mischievously, acting like the Alex I know.\\n\\n \"Mo mank ooh.\"\\n\\n \"Your tongue still burnin\u0027?\"\\n\\n I lift my tongue from the water. \"It feels like a million soccer players are stomping on it with their cleats.\"\\n\\n \"Ouch,\" he says, laughing. \"You know, I heard once that kissin\u0027 reduces the fire.\"\\n\\n \"Is that your cheap way of telling me you want to kiss me?\"\\n\\n He looks into my eyes, his dark gaze capturing mine. \"Querida, I always want to kiss you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid it won\u0027t be that easy, Alex. I want answers. Answers first, then kissing.\"\\n\\n \"Is that why you came here naked underneath that jacket?\"\\n\\n \"Who says I\u0027m naked underneath?\" I say, leaning close.\\n\\n Alex sets down his plate.\\n\\n If my mouth is still burning, I hardly notice. Now is my time to get the upper hand. \"Let\u0027s play a game, Alex. I call it Ask a Question, Then Strip. Every time you ask a question, you have to remove an article of clothing. Every time I ask, I have to remove one.\"\\n\\n \"I figure I can ask seven questions, querida. How many you got?\"\\n\\n \"Take it off, Alex. You asked your first question.\"\\n\\n He nods in agreement and kicks off his shoe.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you start with your shirt?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"You do realize you asked a question. I think that\u0027s your cue--\"\\n\\n \"I did not ask a question,\" I insist.\\n\\n \"You asked me why I don\u0027t start with my shirt.\" He grins.\\n\\n My pulse quickens. I pull down my pom skirt, keeping my long jacket tightly closed. \"Now it\u0027s four.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s trying to stay aloof, but his eyes show a hunger I\u0027ve seen before. And that silly grin is definitely gone as he licks his lips.\\n\\n \"I need a cigarette bad. It\u0027s too bad I quit again. Four you say?\"\\n\\n \"That sounded suspiciously like a question, Alex.\"\\n\\n He shakes his head. \"No, smart-ass, that wasn\u0027t a question. Nice try, though. Um, let\u0027s see. What\u0027s the real reason you came here?\"\\n\\n \"Because I wanted to show you how much I love you,\" I say.\\n\\n Alex blinks a couple of times, but beyond that he shows me no emotion. This time he lifts his shirt over his head. He flings it to the side, baring his bronzed, washboard stomach.\\n\\n I kneel next to him, hoping to tempt him and throw him off balance. \"Do you want to go to college? The truth.\"\\n\\n He hesitates. \"Yes. If my life was different.\"\\n\\n I kick off a sandal.\\n\\n \"Did you ever have sex with Colin?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n He takes off his right shoe, his eyes never leaving mine.\\n\\n \"Did you ever do it with Carmen?\" I ask.\\n\\n He hesitates. \"You don\u0027t want to hear this.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I do. I want to know everything. How many people you\u0027ve been with, the first person you slept with ...\"\\n\\n He rubs the back of his neck, as if there\u0027s a tension knot there he\u0027s trying to relieve. \"That\u0027s a lot of questions.\" He hesitates. \"Carmen and I ... so, um, yeah, we had sex. The last time was in April, before I found out she was sleepin\u0027 around. Before Carmen is a bit of a blur. That\u0027s when I went through a year-long period where it felt like I dated a different girl every few weeks. And slept with most of \u0027em. It was fucked up.\"\\n\\n \"Did you always use protection?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me about the first time?\"\\n\\n \"My first time was with Isabel.\"\\n\\n \"Isabel Avila?\" I ask, totally stunned.\\n\\n He nods. \"It\u0027s not what you think. It happened the summer before freshman year and we both wanted to get the virgin thing over with and find out what all the hype about sex was. It sucked. I fumbled around while she laughed most of the time. We both agreed doin\u0027 it with a friend who you treated like a sibling was the worst idea. Okay, I\u0027ve told you everythin\u0027. Now please take that jacket off.\"\\n\\n \"Not yet, muchacho. If you\u0027ve slept with so many people, how do I know you didn\u0027t catch a disease? Tell me you got tested.\"\\n\\n \"At the clinic when I got the staples in my arm, they tested me. Trust me, I\u0027m clean.\"\\n\\n \"I am, too. Just in case you were wondering.\" I remove my other sandal, glad he didn\u0027t make me feel stupid or give me crap for asking more than one question. \"Your turn.\"\\n\\n \"Do you ever think about makin\u0027 love to me?\" He slides off a sock before I even answer his question.\\n\\n CHAPTER 52 Alex\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she answers. \"Do you think about making love with me?\"\\n\\n I lie awake most nights, fantasizing about sleeping next to her ... loving her. \"Right now, muneca, makin\u0027 love to you is the only thing on my mind.\" I check my watch. I\u0027ve got to go soon. Drug dealers don\u0027t give a shit about your personal life. I can\u0027t be late, but I want Brittany so damn bad. \"Your coat\u0027s next. You sure you want to keep goin\u0027?\"\\n\\n I slip off my other sock. The only things preventing me from being naked are my jeans and briefs.\\n\\n \"Yes, I want to keep going.\" She smiles wide, her beautiful pink lips glistening in the light. \"Turn off the lights before I . . . take my coat off.\"\\n\\n I turn off the shop lights, watching as she stands on the blanket and unbuttons her coat with trembling fingers. I\u0027m in a trance, especially when she looks at me with those clear eyes shining with desire.\\n\\n As she opens her coat slowly, my eyes are fixed on the present inside. She walks toward me, then trips on a discarded shoe.\\n\\n I catch her, then place her on the soft blanket and settle atop her.\\n\\n \"Thanks for breaking my fall,\" she says breathlessly.\\n\\n I brush a strand of hair from her face, then move beside her. When she wraps her arms around my neck, all I want to do is protect this girl for the rest of my life. I ease her jacket open and lean away. A pink lace bra stares back at me. Nothing else.\\n\\n \"Como un angel,\" I whisper.\\n\\n \"Is our game over?\" she asks nervously.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s definitely over, querida. \u0027Cause what we\u0027re gonna do next is no game.\"\\n\\n Her manicured fingers are on my chest. Can she feel my heart beating against her palm? \"I brought protection,\" she says. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-39.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) \\n A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers. \\n When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \u0027perfect\u0027 life is about to unravel before her eyes.
