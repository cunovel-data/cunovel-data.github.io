{"id":86035,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"Tonight changed him, whether he wants to face that fact or not. I\u0027ve changed, too. I walk into Sierra\u0027s house. Sierra is sitting on her living room couch. My father and mother are sitting across from her. \"This looks suspiciously like an intervention,\" I tell them. Sierra says, \"Not an intervention, Brit. A talk.\" \"Why?\" \"Isn\u0027t it obvious?\" my dad says. \"You\u0027re not living at home.\" I stand in front of both my parents, wondering how we got to this point. My mother is in a black pants suit and her hair is in a bun, as if she\u0027s dressed for a funeral. My dad is wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, and his eyes are bloodshot. He\u0027s been up all night, I can tell. And maybe my mom has, too, but she\u0027d never show it. She\u0027d put in Visine to mask it all. \"I can\u0027t play the perfect daughter anymore. I\u0027m not perfect,\" I say calmly and evenly. \"Can you accept that?\" My dad\u0027s eyebrows come together, as if he\u0027s struggling to keep his composure. \"We don\u0027t want you to be perfect. Patricia, tell her how you feel.\" My mom shakes her head, as if she can\u0027t comprehend why I\u0027m making a big deal about this. \"Brit, this has gone on long enough. Stop pouting, stop rebelling, stop being selfish. Your father and I don\u0027t want you to be perfect. We want you to be the best you can be, that\u0027s all.\" \"Because Shelley, no matter how hard she tries, can\u0027t possibly live up to your expectations?\" \"Don\u0027t bring Shelley into this,\" my dad says. \"It\u0027s not fair.\" \"Why not? This is all about Shelley.\" I\u0027m feeling defeated, like no matter how many words come out of my mouth to try and explain it, it\u0027ll never come out right. I plop myself down in one of the plush, velvet chairs in front of them. \"For the record, I didn\u0027t run away. I\u0027m staying at my best friend\u0027s house.\" My mom brushes away a piece of lint on her thigh. \"Thank goodness for her. She\u0027s been telling us what\u0027s been going on with you, giving us daily reports.\" I look over at my best friend, still sitting in the corner as a witness to the Ellises\u0027 meltdown. Sierra puts her hands up guiltily as she heads for the door to hand out candy to late trick-or-treaters who just rang the bell. My mom sits up straight on the edge of the couch. \"What will it take for you to come home?\" I want so much from my parents, probably more than they\u0027re capable of giving. \"I don\u0027t know.\" My dad puts his hand on his forehead, as if he has a headache. \"Is it that bad at home?\" \"Yeah. Well, not bad. But stressful. Mom, you stress me out. And Dad, I hate it when you come and go like the house is your hotel. We\u0027re all strangers living in the house. I love you both, but I don\u0027t want to always be \u0027the best I can be.\u0027 I just want to be me. I want to be free to make my own decisions and learn from my mistakes without freaking out, feeling guilty, or worrying that I\u0027m not living up to your expectations.\" I choke back tears. \"I don\u0027t want to let you two down. I know Shelley can\u0027t be like me. I\u0027m so sorry . . . please don\u0027t send her away because of me.\" My dad kneels beside me. \"Don\u0027t be sorry, Brit. We\u0027re not sending her away because of you. Shelley\u0027s disability isn\u0027t your fault. It\u0027s nobody\u0027s fault.\" My mom is silent and still, staring at the wall as if she\u0027s in a trance. \"It\u0027s my fault,\" she says. Everyone focuses on my mom because those are the last words we expected to come out of her mouth. \"Patricia?\" my dad says, trying to get her attention. \"Mom, what are you talking about?\" I ask. She\u0027s looking straight ahead. \"All these years I\u0027ve blamed myself.\" \"Patricia, it\u0027s not your fault.\" \"When I had Shelley, I took her to playgroups,\" my mom says in a soft voice as if she\u0027s talking to herself. \"I admit I envied the other moms with the normal kids who could keep their heads up on their own and grasp things. Most of the time I got the pity stares. I hated that. I became obsessed with thinking I could\u0027ve prevented her from being disabled by eating more vegetables and exercising more--I blamed myself for her condition even when your father insisted it wasn\u0027t my fault.\" She looks at me and smiles wistfully. \"Then you came along. My blond-haired, blue-eyed princess.\" \"Mom, I\u0027m no princess and Shelley\u0027s not someone to pity. I\u0027m not always going to date the guy you want me to date, I\u0027m not always going to dress the way you want me to dress, and I\u0027m definitely not always going to act the way you want. Shelley isn\u0027t going to live up to your expectations either.\" \"I know.\" \"Will you ever be okay with it?\" \"Probably not.\" \"You\u0027re so critical. Oh, God, I\u0027d do anything for you to stop blaming me for every little thing that goes wrong. Love me for who I am. Love Shelley for who she is. Stop focusing on the bad stuff because life is just too damn short.\" \"You don\u0027t want me being concerned because you\u0027ve decided to date a gang member?\" she asks. \"No. Yes. I don\u0027t know. If I didn\u0027t feel like you\u0027d be judgmental, I\u0027d share it with you. If you could meet him . . . he\u0027s just sooo much more than people see on the outside. If you want me to sneak around just so I can be with him, I\u0027ll do it.\" \"He\u0027s a gang member,\" my mom says dryly. \"His name is Alex.\" My dad leans back. \"Knowing his name doesn\u0027t change the fact that he\u0027s in a gang, Brittany.\" \"No, it doesn\u0027t. It\u0027s a step in the right direction, though. Would you rather have me be truthful, or sneaking around?\" It took us an hour until my mom agreed to try and stop hovering so much. And for my dad to agree to come home twice a week from work before six. I agreed to have Alex come by the house so they could meet him. And to tell them where I\u0027m going and who I\u0027m going with. They haven\u0027t agreed to approve or like my choice in boyfriends, but it\u0027s a start. I want to try making things right because picking up the pieces is way better than leaving them the way they are. CHAPTER 54 Alex The deal is supposed to happen here, at the forest preserve in Busse Woods. The parking lot and area beyond are dark, with a sliver of moonlight to guide me. The place is deserted, except for a blue sedan with its lights on. I walk farther into the woods and catch a glimpse of a dark figure lying on the ground. I run while dread washes over me. I recognize my jacket the closer I get. It\u0027s like seeing my own death in front of me. Kneeling on the ground, I slowly turn the body over. Paco. \"Oh, shit,\" I cry as I feel his hot, wet blood soak my hands. Paco\u0027s eyes are glazed, but he moves his hand slowly and grabs onto my arm. \"I fucked up.\" I rest Paco\u0027s head on my thighs. \"I told you to stop interferin\u0027 with my life. Don\u0027t die on me, you better not die on me,\" I choke out. \"Holy shit, you\u0027re bleedin\u0027 all over.\" Bright red blood streams out of his mouth. \"I\u0027m scared,\" he whispers, then winces in pain. \"Don\u0027t leave me. Hold on and it\u0027ll be fine.\" I hold Paco tightly, knowing I just lied to him. My best friend is dying. There\u0027s no going back. I feel his pain as if it\u0027s my own. \"Lookie here, it\u0027s pretend Alex and his sidekick, the real Alex. Some Halloween night, ain\u0027t it?\" I turn to the sound of Hector\u0027s voice. \"It\u0027s too bad I couldn\u0027t tell it was Paco I was shooting at,\" he continues. \"Man, you two look so different in daylight. I guess I should get my eyes checked.\" He pulls a gun on me. I\u0027m not scared. I\u0027m angry. And I need answers. \"Why did you do this?\" \"If you must know, it\u0027s your father\u0027s fault. He wanted out of the Blood. But there is no out, Alex. He was the best we had, your padre. Right before he died, he tried to quit. That last drug deal was his challenge, Alex. Father-son drug deal. You both make it out alive, he wins.\" He laughs, a cackling sound reverberating in my ears. \"The stupid motherfucker never had a chance. You\u0027re too much like your old man. I thought I could train you to take his place as a great drug and gun dealer. But no, you really are like your old man. A quitter ... un rajado.\" I look down at Paco. He\u0027s hardly breathing, the air barely making it out of his lungs. Looking down at his blood-stained chest, the growing red bull\u0027s-eye reminds me of my papa. This time, though, I\u0027m not six years old. Everything is crystal clear. My eyes meet Paco\u0027s for an intense second. \"The Latino Blood betrayed us both, man,\" are the last words Paco says before his eyes glaze over and he falls limp in my arms. \"Put him down, already! He\u0027s dead, Alex. Just like your old man. Get up and face me!\" Hector yells, waving his gun in the air like a lunatic. I gently lay Paco\u0027s lifeless body on the ground and stand, ready to fight. \"Put your hands on your head so I can see \u0027em. You know, when I killed el viejo you cried like an escuincle, a baby, Alex. You cried in my arms, the guy who killed him. Ironic, huh?\" I was only six. If I\u0027d known it was Hector, I wouldn\u0027t have joined the Blood. \"Why\u0027d you do it, Hector?\" \"Boy, you\u0027ll never learn, will you? You see, tu papa thought he was better than me. I showed him, didn\u0027t I? He bragged that the south side of Fairfield was a cut above since the high school was in a rich hood. Said in Fairfield there were no gangs. I changed that, Alex. Got my guys to go in and make every household belong to me. It was either come to me, or lose everything. That, my boy, is what makes me el jefe.\" \"It makes you a madman.\" \"Madman. Genius. Same thing.\" Hector pushes me with the gun. \"Now get on your knees. I think this is a good place for you to die. Right here in the woods, like an animal. You want to die like an animal, Alex?\" \"You\u0027re the animal, asshole. You could at least look me in the eye when you murder me, like you did to my father.\" When Hector walks around me, I finally have a chance. Grabbing Hector\u0027s wrist, I force him to the ground. Hector swears and is fast to his feet, the gun still in his hand. I use his disorientation to my advantage and kick him in the side. Whirling around, Hector knocks the side of my head with the butt of his gun. I fall on my knees, cursing the fact that I\u0027m not invincible. Thoughts of mi papa and Paco give me the strength to fight back through the blur. I\u0027m all too aware Hector is trying to get a good shot at me. When I kick Hector back, I scramble to my feet. Hector\u0027s Clock is pointed directly at my chest. \"This is the Arlington Heights police! Drop your weapons and put your hands in the air where we can see them!\" Through the woods and the haze, I can barely see red and blue lights flashing in the distance. I raise my hands. \"Drop it, Hector. The game is over.\" Hector holds the gun steady, aimed at my chest. \"Put the gun down,\" the police call out. \"Now!\" Hector\u0027s eyes are wild. I feel his rage from the five feet separating us. _I know he\u0027s going to do it. Es un cabron. He\u0027s going to pull the trigger. \"You\u0027re wrong, Alex,\" he says. \"The game has just begun.\" The whole thing happens fast. I move to the right as the shots ring out. Pop. Pop. Pop. Stumbling backward, I know I\u0027m hit. The bullet burns through my skin as if someone is pouring Tabasco on it. Then my world goes black.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-41.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.
