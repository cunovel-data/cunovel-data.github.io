{"id":86022,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"\"Here, take this.\" Hector pulls a pistol out from under his car seat. \"El policia confiscated yours.\"\\n\\n I hesitate, remembering when the police asked me if I had any weapons on me. Dios mio, it was humiliating having a gun pointed at my chest as they removed the Glock. But refusing Hector\u0027s gun would be considered disrespectful, and I\u0027d never dis Hector. I take the gun and stick it in the waistband of my jeans.\\n\\n \"I heard you\u0027ve been asking questions about your papa. My advice is to let it go, Alex.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t. You know that.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if you find anything out, let me know. I always have your back.\"\\n\\n \"I know. Thanks, man.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s quiet in the house. I walk into my bedroom, where both of my brothers are sleeping. Opening my top drawer, I bury the gun under the wooden board where nobody can accidentally find it. It\u0027s a trick Paco taught me. I lie on my bed and cover my eyes with my forearm, hoping I can get some sleep tonight.\\n\\n Yesterday flashes before my eyes. The image of Brittany, her lips on mine, her sweet breath mixed with my own, is the only picture that lingers in my mind.\\n\\n As I drift off, her angelic face is the only image that keeps the nightmare of my past away.\\n\\n CHAPTER 35 Brittany\\n\\n Rumors are flying furiously through Fairfield that Alex got arrested. I have to find out if it\u0027s true. I find Isabel between first and second period. She\u0027s talking with a bunch of her friends but leaves them and pulls me aside.\\n\\n She tells me Alex was arrested yesterday but made bail. She has no clue where he is, but she\u0027ll ask around and meet me between third and fourth period at my locker. I hurry to my locker between third and fourth, craning my neck in anticipation. Isabel is waiting for me.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell anyone I gave this to you,\" she says, and slips me a folded sheet of paper.\\n\\n Pretending to look in my locker, I unfold it. It has an address on it.\\n\\n I\u0027ve never ditched school before. Of course a boy I kissed has never been arrested before, either.\\n\\n This is about me being real. To myself. And now I\u0027m going to be real to Alex, like he\u0027s always wanted. It\u0027s scary, and I\u0027m not convinced I\u0027m doing the right thing. But I can\u0027t ignore this magnetic pull that Alex has over me.\\n\\n I plug in the address on my GPS. It leads me to the south side, to a place called Enrique\u0027s Auto Body. A guy is standing in front. His mouth drops open the minute he sees me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m looking for Alex Fuentes.\"\\n\\n The guy doesn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n \"Is he here?\" I ask, feeling awkward. Maybe he doesn\u0027t speak English.\\n\\n \"What do you want with Alejandro?\" the guy finally asks.\\n\\n My heart is pumping so hard I can see my shirt move with each beat. \"I need to talk to him.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be better off if you leave him alone,\" the guy says.\\n\\n \"Esta bien, Enrique,\" a familiar voice booms. I turn to Alex, leaning against the auto body\u0027s front door with a shop towel hanging out of his pocket and a wrench in his hand. The hair peeking out of his bandanna is mussed and he looks more masculine than any guy I\u0027ve ever seen.\\n\\n I want to hold him. I need him to tell me it\u0027s okay, that he\u0027s not going to jail ever again.\\n\\n Alex keeps his eyes fixed on mine.\\n\\n \"I guess I\u0027ll leave you two alone,\" I think I hear Enrique say, but I\u0027m too focused on Alex to hear clearly.\\n\\n My feet are glued to the same spot so it\u0027s a good thing he saunters toward me.\\n\\n \"Urn,\" I start. Please let me get through this. \"I, uh, heard you got arrested. I had to see if you\u0027re okay.\"\\n\\n \"You ditched school to see if I was okay?\"\\n\\n I nod because my tongue won\u0027t work.\\n\\n Alex steps back. \"Well, then. Now that you\u0027ve seen I\u0027m okay, go back to school. I gotta, you know, get back to work. My bike was impounded last night and I need to make money to get it back.\"\\n\\n \"Wait!\" I yell. I take a deep breath. This is it. I\u0027m going to spill my guts. \"I don\u0027t know why or when I started falling for you, Alex. But I did. Ever since I almost ran over your motorcycle that first day of school I haven\u0027t been able to stop thinking about what it would be like if you and I got together. And that kiss ... God, I swear I never experienced anything like that in my life. It did mean something. If the solar system didn\u0027t tilt then, it never will. I know it\u0027s crazy because we\u0027re so different. And if anything happens between us I don\u0027t want people at school to know. Not that you\u0027ll agree to have a secret relationship with me, but I at least have to find out if it\u0027s possible. I broke up with Colin, who I had a very public relationship with and I\u0027m ready for something private. Private and real. I know I\u0027m babbling like an idiot, but if you don\u0027t say something soon or give me a hint of what you\u0027re thinking then I\u0027ll--\"\\n\\n \"Say it again,\" he says.\\n\\n \"That whole drawn-out speech?\" I remember something about a solar system, but I\u0027m too light-headed to recite the entire thing all over again.\\n\\n He steps closer. \"No. The part about you fallin\u0027 for me.\"\\n\\n My eyes cling to his. \"I think about you all the time, Alex. And I really, really want to kiss you again.\"\\n\\n The sides of his mouth turn up.\\n\\n Unable to face him, I look at the ground. \"Don\u0027t make fun of me.\" I can take anything but that right about now.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t turn away from me, mamacita. I\u0027d never make fun of you.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want to like you,\" I admit, looking back up at him.\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"This probably won\u0027t work,\" I tell him.\\n\\n \"Probably not.\"\\n\\n \"My home life\u0027s not so perfect.\"\\n\\n \"That makes two of us,\" he says.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m willing to find out what this thing is going on between us. Are you?\"\\n\\n \"If we weren\u0027t outside,\" he says, \"I\u0027d show you--\"\\n\\n I cut him off by grabbing the thick hair at the base of his neck and pulling that gorgeous head of his down. If we can\u0027t exactly have privacy right now, I\u0027ll settle for being real. Besides, everyone who we need to keep this a secret from is in school.\\n\\n Alex keeps his hands at his side, but when I part my lips, he groans against my mouth and his wrench drops to the ground with a loud clink.\\n\\n His strong hands wrap around me, making me feel protected. His velvet tongue mingles with mine, creating an unfamiliar melting sensation deep within my body. This is more than making out, it\u0027s . . . well, it feels like a lot more.\\n\\n His hands never stop moving; one circles my back while the other plays with my hair.\\n\\n Alex isn\u0027t the only one exploring. My hands are roving all over him, feeling his muscles tense beneath my hands and heightening my awareness of him. I touch his jaw and the roughness of a day\u0027s growth scratches my skin.\\n\\n A loud clearing of Enrique\u0027s throat tears us apart.\\n\\n Alex looks at me with intense passion. \"I have to get back to work,\" he says, his breathing ragged.\\n\\n \"Oh. Well, sure.\" Suddenly embarrassed at our PDA, I step back.\\n\\n \"Can I see you later today?\" he asks.\\n\\n \"My friend Sierra is coming over for dinner.\"\\n\\n \"The one who looks in her purse a lot?\"\\n\\n \"Urn, yeah.\" I need to change the subject or I\u0027ll be tempted to invite him, too. I can see it all now--my mom seething in disgust at Alex and his tattoos.\\n\\n \"My cousin Elena is gettin\u0027 married on Sunday. Go with me to the wedding,\" he says.\\n\\n I look at the ground. \"I can\u0027t have my friends know about us. Or my parents.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t tell \u0027em.\"\\n\\n \"What about people at the wedding? They\u0027ll all see us together.\"\\n\\n \"Nobody from school will be there. Except my family, and I\u0027ll make sure they keep their mouths shut.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t. Lying and sneaking around has never been my strong point. I push him away. \"I can\u0027t think when you\u0027re standing that close.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Now about that wedding.\"\\n\\n God, looking at him makes me want to go. \"What time?\"\\n\\n \"Noon. It\u0027ll be an experience you won\u0027t forget. Trust me. I\u0027ll pick you up at eleven.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say \u0027yes\u0027 yet.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, but you were about to,\" he says in his dark, smooth voice.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t I meet you here at eleven,\" I suggest, gesturing to the body shop. If my mom finds out about us, all hell will break loose.\\n\\n He lifts my chin up to face him. \"Why aren\u0027t you afraid of bein\u0027 with me?\"\\n\\n \"Are you kidding? I\u0027m terrified.\" I focus on the tattoos running up and down his arms.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t pretend to live a squeaky-clean life.\" He holds up my hand so it\u0027s palm against palm with his. Is he thinking about the difference in the color of our skin, his rough fingers against the nail polish on the tips of mine? \"In some ways we\u0027re so opposite,\" he says.\\n\\n I thread my fingers through his. \"Yeah, but in other ways we\u0027re so similar.\"\\n\\n That gets a smile out of him, until Enrique clears his throat again.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll meet you here at eleven on Sunday,\" I say.\\n\\n Alex backs away, nods, and winks. \"This time it\u0027s a date.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 36 Alex\\n\\n \"Man, she was kissin\u0027 you like it was the last kiss of her life. If she kisses like that, I wonder how she--\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Enrique.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s gonna ruin you, Alejo,\" Enrique continues, calling me by my Spanish nickname. \"Look at you already, spendin\u0027 time in jail last night and cuttin\u0027 school to get your motorcycle back. Granted, she\u0027s got a buena torta, but is she worth it?\"\\n\\n \"I gotta get back to work,\" I say, my mind whirling with Enrique\u0027s words. And as I work under a Blazer for the remainder of the evening, all I want to do is make out with my mamacita again and again.\\n\\n Yes, she\u0027s definitely worth it.\\n\\n \"Alex, Hector is here. With Chuy,\" Enrique says at six o\u0027clock when I\u0027m ready to head home.\\n\\n I wipe my hands on my work pants. \"Where are they?\"\\n\\n \"In my office.\"\\n\\n A feeling of dread washes over me as I approach the room. When I open the door, Hector stands there as if he owns the place. Chuy is in the corner, a not-so-innocent bystander.\\n\\n \"Enrique, this is a private matter.\"\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t noticed Enrique behind me, acting as my ally should I need one. I give a nod to my cousin. I\u0027ve been loyal to the Blood, there\u0027s no reason Hector should doubt my commitment. Chuy\u0027s presence makes this meeting a big deal. If it was just Hector, I wouldn\u0027t be this tense.\\n\\n Alex,\" Hector says the moment Enrique is out of sight. \u0027Ain\u0027t it good to meet here instead of the courthouse?\"\\n\\n I give him a weak smile and shut the door.\\n\\n Hector motions to the small, ripped couch on the far side of the room. \"Sit down.\" He waits until I take a seat. \"I need you to do me a favor, amigo.\"\\n\\n There\u0027s no use in delaying the inevitable. \"What kind of favor?\" \"A shipment needs to be delivered October thirty-first.\" That\u0027s over a month and a half away. Halloween night. \"I don\u0027t deal drugs,\" I cut in. \"You knew that from day one.\"\\n\\n I eye Chuy like a pitcher in baseball does when a guy leads too far off base.\\n\\n Hector stands over me and puts his hand on my shoulder. \"You\u0027ve got to get over what happened to your old man. If you want to lead the Blood, you\u0027ve got to deal drugs.\"\\n\\n \"Then count me out.\"\\n\\n Hector\u0027s hand tightens and Chuy steps forward. A silent threat.\\n\\n \"I wish it were that simple,\" Hector says. \"I need you to do this for me. And, quite honestly, you owe me.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-28.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) \\n A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers. \\n When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \u0027perfect\u0027 life is about to unravel before her eyes.
