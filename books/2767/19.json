{"id":86013,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"There\u0027s been something nagging at me all day. As long as I\u0027m here with him, I might as well ask. \"Did we kiss last night?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Well, it wasn\u0027t memorable because I have no recollection of it.\"\\n\\n He laughs. \"I was kiddin\u0027. We didn\u0027t kiss.\" He leans in. \"When we kiss you\u0027ll remember it. Forever.\"\\n\\n Oh, God. I wish his words didn\u0027t leave my knees weak. I know I should be scared, alone with a gang member in a deserted place talking about kissing. But I\u0027m not. Deep in my soul I know he wouldn\u0027t intentionally hurt me or force me to do anything.\\n\\n \"Why did you kidnap me?\" I ask.\\n\\n He grabs my hand and leads me to the driver\u0027s side. \"Get in.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m teachin\u0027 you how to drive this car properly, before the engine falls out from abuse.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you were mad at me. Why are you helping me?\"\\n\\n \"Because I want to.\"\\n\\n Oh. I wasn\u0027t expecting that at all. My heart is starting to thaw, because it\u0027s been a long time since someone cared enough to do something just to help me. Although . . . \"This isn\u0027t because you want me to pay you back with favors, is it?\"\\n\\n He shakes his head.\\n\\n \"For real?\"\\n\\n \"For real.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re not mad at me because of anything I said or did?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m frustrated, Brittany. About you. About my brother. About a lot of shit.\"\\n\\n \"Then why take me here?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t ask questions you\u0027re not ready to hear the answer to. Cool?\"\\n\\n \"Cool.\" I slide into the driver\u0027s seat and wait for him to sit beside me.\\n\\n \"You ready?\" he asks when he\u0027s settled and buckled in the passenger seat.\\n\\n \"Yep.\"\\n\\n He leans over and puts the keys in the ignition. When I release the parking brake and start the car, it dies.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t put it in neutral. If you don\u0027t have your foot on the clutch, it\u0027s gonna die if you\u0027re in gear.\"\\n\\n \"I knew that,\" I say, feeling totally stupid. \"You\u0027re just making me nervous.\"\\n\\n He puts the stick into neutral for me. \"Put your left foot on the clutch, your right foot on the brake, and go into first,\" he instructs.\\n\\n Putting my foot on the gas and letting up on the clutch, the car jerks forward.\\n\\n He braces himself with his hand on the dash. \"Stop.\"\\n\\n I stop the car and put it in neutral.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to find the sweet spot.\"\\n\\n I look at him. \"The sweet spot?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. You know, when the clutch catches.\" He\u0027s using his hands when he talks, pretending his hands are the pedals. \"You release it too fast. Get that balance and stay there . . . feel it out. Try again.\"\\n\\n I put the car in first again and let up on the clutch as I press on the gas.\\n\\n \"Hold it . . . ,\" he says. \"Feel the sweet spot. Linger there.\"\\n\\n I let out the clutch and hold down the gas pedal but don\u0027t push down on it all the way. \"I think I got it.\"\\n\\n \"Let go of the clutch now, but don\u0027t gun the gas.\"\\n\\n I try, but the car jerks, then stalls.\\n\\n \"You popped the clutch. Don\u0027t release the clutch too fast. Try again,\" he says, totally unfazed. He\u0027s not upset, frustrated, or itching to give up. \"You needed to give it more gas. Don\u0027t gun it, but give it enough juice to start movin\u0027.\"\\n\\n I do the same steps, but this time the car moves forward without jerking. We\u0027re on the runway, moving up to ten miles an hour.\\n\\n \"Press in the clutch,\" he instructs, then puts his hand over mine on the stick and helps me shift into second. I try to ignore his gentle touch and the warmth of his hand, so contradictory to his personality, and attempt to focus on the task.\\n\\n He\u0027s very patient as he instructs in detail how to downshift until we\u0027ve come to a stop at the end of the runway. His fingers are still wrapped around mine.\\n\\n \"Lesson over?\" I ask.\\n\\n Alex clears his throat. \"Um, yeah.\" He takes his hand off mine, then weaves his fingers through his black mane, strands falling loosely across his forehead.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I say.\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, my ears were bleedin\u0027 every time I heard your engine rev in the lot at school. I didn\u0027t do it to be a good guy.\"\\n\\n I cock my head to the side and try and get him to look at me. He doesn\u0027t. \"Why is it so important that you\u0027re perceived as a bad boy, huh? Tell me.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 24 Alex\\n\\n For the first time we\u0027re having a civilized discussion. Now I\u0027ve got to come up with something to break that defensive wall of hers.\\n\\n Oh, man. I need to reveal something that makes me vulnerable. If she sees me as vulnerable instead of an asshole, maybe I can make some headway with her. And somehow I know she\u0027ll be able to tell if I\u0027m bullshitting.\\n\\n I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m doing this for the bet, for the chemistry project, or for me. In fact, I\u0027m totally cool with not analyzing that part of what\u0027s happening here.\\n\\n \"My dad was murdered in front of me when I was six,\" I tell her.\\n\\n Her eyes go wide. \"Really?\"\\n\\n I nod. I don\u0027t like talking about it, not sure I can even if I want to.\\n\\n Her manicured hands cover her mouth. \"I didn\u0027t know that. Oh, God, I\u0027m so sorry. That must have been horrible.\"\\n\\n \"Yep.\" It feels good to let it out, to make myself talk about it out loud. My dad\u0027s nervous smile turning into shock right before he was shot.\\n\\n Wow, I can\u0027t believe I remembered the expression on his face. Why would his smile be replaced by shock? That detail was totally forgotten until now. I\u0027m still confused as I turn to Brittany. \"If I care too much about shit and it\u0027s taken away, I\u0027ll feel like I did the day my dad died. I never want to feel that way, so instead I make myself care about nothin\u0027.\"\\n\\n Her face is full of regret, sorrow, and sympathy. I can tell it\u0027s not an act.\\n\\n Her brow is still furrowed when she says, \"Thanks for, you know, telling me. But I can\u0027t imagine you can actually make yourself care about nothing. You can\u0027t program yourself like that.\"\\n\\n \"Wanna bet?\" Suddenly I\u0027m desperate to change the subject. \"Your turn to share.\"\\n\\n She looks away. I don\u0027t push her to say anything for fear she\u0027ll come to her senses and want to leave.\\n\\n Could it be harder for her to share even a glimpse into her world? My life has been so fucked up, it\u0027s damn hard to believe her life could possibly be any worse. I watch as a lone tear escapes from her eye and she quickly wipes it away.\\n\\n \"My sister--,\" she starts. \"My sister has cerebral palsy. And is mentally delayed. \u0027Retarded\u0027 is the term most people use. She can\u0027t walk, she uses what\u0027s called verbal approximations and nonverbal cues instead of words because she can\u0027t talk. . . .\" With that, another tear escapes. This time she lets it fall without wiping it away. I have the urge to wipe them for her but sense she needs to be left untouched. She takes a deep breath. \"And she\u0027s been angry about something, but I don\u0027t know what. She started pulling hair, and yesterday she pulled mine so hard a clump came out. My head was bleeding and my mom was freaking out on me.\"\\n\\n So that\u0027s where the mysterious patch of baldness came from. Not a drug test.\\n\\n For the first time, though, I feel sorry for her. I imagined her life as a fairy tale; the worst thing that could possibly happen would be a pea under her mattress keeping her up at night.\\n\\n I guess that\u0027s not the case.\\n\\n Something is happening. I sense a change in the wind ... a mutual understanding of each other. I haven\u0027t felt this way in forever. I clear my throat, then say, \"Your mom probably blows up at you the most because she knows you can take it.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. You\u0027re probably right. Better me than my sister.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s no excuse, though.\" I\u0027m being real now, and hope she is, too. \"Listen, I don\u0027t want to be an asshole to you,\" I say. So much for the Alex Fuentes Show.\\n\\n \"I know. It\u0027s your image, what Alex Fuentes is all about. It\u0027s your brand, your logo . . . dangerous, deadly, hot and sexy Mexican. I wrote the book on creating an image. I wasn\u0027t exactly aiming for the blond bimbo look, though. More like the perfect, untouchable look.\"\\n\\n Whoa. Rewind. Brittany called me hot and sexy. I was not expecting that at all. Maybe I have a chance of winning that stupid bet. \"You do realize you called me hot.\"\\n\\n \"As if you didn\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know Brittany Ellis considered me hot. \"For the record, I thought you were untouchable. But now that I know you think I\u0027m a hot, sexy, Mexican god ...\"\\n\\n \"I never said the word \u0027god.\u0027\"\\n\\n I put my finger to my lips. \"Shh, let me enjoy the fantasy for one minute.\" I close my eyes. Brittany laughs, this sweet sound that echoes in my ears.\\n\\n \"In some deranged way, Alex, I think I understand you. Although I\u0027m really pissed off at you for being such a Neanderthal.\" When I open my eyes, I find her watching me. \"Don\u0027t tell anyone about my sister,\" she says. \"I don\u0027t like people knowing anything about me.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re actors in our lives, pretendin\u0027 to be who we want people to think we are.\"\\n\\n \"So you understand why I\u0027d freak out if my parents find out we\u0027re . . . friends.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d get in trouble? Shit, you\u0027re eighteen. Don\u0027t you think you can be friends with who you want to by now? The umbilical cord\u0027s been cut, you know.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"Try me.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you want to know so much?\"\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t chem partners supposed to know a lot about each other?\"\\n\\n She gives a short laugh. \"I hope not.\"\\n\\n Truth is, this girl isn\u0027t what I thought she\u0027d be. From the moment I told her about my dad, it was as if her entire body sighed in relief. As if someone else\u0027s misery comforted her, made her feel as if she wasn\u0027t alone. I still can\u0027t understand why she cares so much, why she chooses the Tam-flawless facade to show the world.\\n\\n Looming over my head is The Bet. I have to get this girl to fall for me. And while my body says go for it, the rest of me is thinking You\u0027re a complete bastard because she\u0027s vulnerable.\\n\\n \"1 want the same things out of life you do,\" I admit. \"I just go about them in a different way. You adapt to your environment, I adapt to mine.\" I put my hand back on hers. \"Let me show you I\u0027m different. Oye, would you ever date a guy who couldn\u0027t afford to take you to expensive restaurants and buy you gold and diamonds?\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely.\" She slips her hand out from under mine. \"But I have a boyfriend.\"\\n\\n \"If you didn\u0027t, would you give this Mexicano a chance?\"\\n\\n Her face turns a deep shade of pink. I wonder if Colin ever makes her blush like that. \"I\u0027m not answering that,\" she says.\\n\\n \"Why not? It\u0027s a simple question.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, please. Nothing about you is simple, Alex. Let\u0027s not even go there.\" She puts the car in first gear. \"Can we go now?\"\\n\\n \"Si, if you want. Are we cool?\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n I hold my hand out for her to shake. She eyes the tattoos on my fingers, then extends her hand toward mine and shakes it, her enthusiasm apparent. \"To hand warmers,\" she says with a smile on her lips.\\n\\n \"To hand warmers,\" I agree. And sex, I add silently.\\n\\n \"Do you want to drive back? I don\u0027t know the way.\"\\n\\n I drive her back in comfortable silence while the sun sets. Our truce brings me closer to my goals: graduating, the bet. . . and something else I\u0027m not ready to admit. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-19.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) \\n A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers. \\n When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \u0027perfect\u0027 life is about to unravel before her eyes.
