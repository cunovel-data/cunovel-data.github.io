{"id":85996,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"Would it matter?\" I mumble as I pick up a tortilla. I look up, trying to gauge her reaction.\\n\\n Her back is to me as she cleans dishes in the sink. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Alex wants to pretend he\u0027s white,\" Carlos chimes in. \"You can change your name, bro, but nobody\u0027d mistake you for anythin\u0027 other than Mexicano.\"\\n\\n \"Carlos, collate la boca,\" I warn. I don\u0027t want to be white. I just don\u0027t want to be associated with my father.\\n\\n \"Por favor, you two,\" our mother pleads. \"Enough fighting for one day.\"\\n\\n \"Mojado,\" Carlos sings, egging me on by calling me a wetback.\\n\\n I\u0027ve had enough of Carlos\u0027s mouth; he\u0027s gone too far. I stand, my chair scraping the floor. Carlos follows and steps in front of me, closing the space between us. He knows I could kick his ass. His overblown ego is gonna get him in trouble with the wrong person one of these days.\\n\\n \"Carlos, sit down,\" mi\u0027ama orders.\\n\\n \"Dirty beaner,\" Carlos drawls at me in a fake deep accent. \"Better yet, es un Ganguero.\"\\n\\n \"Carlos!\" mi\u0027ama reprimands sharply as she comes forward, but I get in between them and grab my brother\u0027s collar.\\n\\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s all anyone will ever think of me,\" I tell him. \"But you keep talkin\u0027 trash and they\u0027ll think that of you, too.\"\\n\\n \"Brother, they\u0027ll think that of me anyway. Whether I want them to or not.\"\\n\\n I release him. \"You\u0027re wrong, Carlos. You can do better, be better.\"\\n\\n \"Than you?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, better than me and you know it,\" I say. \"Now apologize to mi\u0027ama for talkin\u0027 smack in front of her.\"\\n\\n One look in my eyes and Carlos knows I\u0027m not kidding around. \"Sorry, Ma,\" he says, then sits back down. I don\u0027t miss his glare, though, as his ego got knocked down a peg.\\n\\n Mi\u0027amd turns and opens the fridge, trying to hide her tears. Damn it, she\u0027s worried about Carlos. He\u0027s a sophomore and the next two years are either going to make him or break him.\\n\\n I pull on my black leather jacket, needing to get out of here. I give mi\u0027ama a peck on the cheek with an apology for ruining her breakfast, then walk outside wondering how I\u0027m going to keep Carlos and Luis away from my path while steering them toward a better one. Oh, the fucking irony of it all.\\n\\n On the street, guys in the same color bandannas flag the Latino Blood signal: right hand tapping twice on their left arm while their ring finger is bent. My veins fire up as I flag right back before straddling my motorcycle. They want a tough-as-nails gang member, they got one. I put on a hell of a show to the outside world; sometimes I even surprise myself.\\n\\n \"Alex, wait up,\" a familiar female voice calls out.\\n\\n Carmen Sanchez, my neighbor and ex-girlfriend, runs up to me.\\n\\n \"Hey, Carmen,\" I mutter.\\n\\n \"How about giving me a ride to school?\"\\n\\n Her short black skirt shows off her incredible legs, and her shirt is tight, accentuating her small but perky chichis. Once I would have done anything for her, but that was before I caught her in another guy\u0027s bed over the summer. Or car, as it was.\\n\\n \"Come on, Alex. I promise not to bite . . . unless you want me to.\"\\n\\n Carmen is my Latino Blood homegirl. Whether we\u0027re a couple or not, we still have each other\u0027s backs. It\u0027s the code we live by. \"Get on,\" I say.\\n\\n Carmen hops on my motorcycle and deliberately places her hands on my thighs while pressing against my backside. It doesn\u0027t have the effect she was probably hoping for. What does she think, that I\u0027ll forget the past? No way. My history defines who I am.\\n\\n I try to focus on starting my senior year at Fairfield, the here and now. It\u0027s damn difficult because, unfortunately, after graduation my future will likely be as screwed up as my past.\\n\\n CHAPTER 3 Brittany\\n\\n \"My hair gets all frizzy in this car, Sierra. Every time I put the top down, my hair looks like I\u0027ve walked through a tornado,\" I say to my best friend as I drive on Vine Street toward Fairfield High in my new silver convertible.\\n\\n \"Outward appearances mean everything.\" My parents taught me the motto that rules my life. It\u0027s the sole reason I didn\u0027t comment about the BMW when my dad gave me the extravagant birthday present two weeks ago.\\n\\n \"We live a half hour from the Windy City,\" Sierra says, holding her hand in the wind as we drive. \"Chicago isn\u0027t exactly known for its calm weather. Besides, you look like a blond, Grecian goddess with wild hair, Brit. You\u0027re just nervous about seeing Colin again.\"\\n\\n My gaze wanders to the heart-shaped picture of me and Colin taped to my dashboard. \"A summer apart changes people.\"\\n\\n \"Distance makes the heart grow fonder,\" Sierra throws back. \"You\u0027re the captain of the pom squad and he\u0027s captain of the varsity football team. You two have to date or the solar system would go out of alignment.\"\\n\\n Colin called a few times during the summer from his family\u0027s cabin, where he was hanging out with his buddies, but I don\u0027t know where our relationship stands now. He just got back last night.\\n\\n \"I love those jeans,\" Sierra says, eyeing my faded Brazilian pants. \"I\u0027ll be borrowing them before you know it.\"\\n\\n \"My mom hates them,\" I tell her, smoothing my hair at a stoplight, trying to tame my blond frizzies. \"She says it looks like I got them at a used clothing store.\"\\n\\n \"Did you tell her vintage is in?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, like she\u0027d even listen. She was hardly paying attention when I asked her about the new caretaker.\"\\n\\n No one understands what it\u0027s like at my house. Luckily, I have Sierra. She might not understand, but she knows enough to listen and keep my home life confidential. Besides Colin, Sierra is the only one who\u0027s met my sister.\\n\\n Sierra flips open my CD case. \"What happened to the last caretaker?\"\\n\\n \"Shelley pulled a chunk of her hair out.\"\\n\\n \"Ouch.\"\\n\\n I drive into the high school parking lot with my mind more on my sister than on the road. My wheels screech to a stop when I almost hit a guy and girl on a motorcycle. I thought it was an empty parking space.\\n\\n \"Watch it, bitch,\" Carmen Sanchez, the girl on the back of the motorcycle, says as she flips me the finger.\\n\\n She obviously missed the Road Rage lecture in Driver\u0027s Ed.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" I say loudly so I can be heard over the roar of the motorcycle. \"It didn\u0027t look like anyone was in this spot.\"\\n\\n Then I realize whose motorcycle I almost hit. The driver turns around. Angry dark eyes. Red and black bandanna. I sink down into the driver\u0027s seat as far as I can.\\n\\n \"Oh, shit. It\u0027s Alex Fuentes,\" I say, wincing.\\n\\n \"Jesus, Brit,\" Sierra says, her voice low. \"I\u0027d like to live to see graduation. Get outta here before he decides to kill us both.\"\\n\\n Alex is staring at me with his devil eyes while putting the kickstand down on his motorcycle. Is he going to confront me?\\n\\n I search for reverse, frantically moving the stick back and forth. Of course it\u0027s no surprise my dad bought me a car with a stick shift without taking the time to teach me how to master driving the thing.\\n\\n Alex takes a step toward my car. My instincts tell me to abandon the car and flee, as if I was stuck on railroad tracks with a train heading straight for me. I glance at Sierra, who\u0027s desperately searching through her purse for something. Is she kidding me?\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t get this damn car in reverse. I need help. What are you looking for?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"Like . . . nothing. I\u0027m trying not to make eye contact with those Latino Bloods. Get a move on, will ya?\" Sierra responds through gritted teeth. \"Besides, I only know how to drive an automatic.\"\\n\\n Finally grinding into reverse, my wheels screech loud and hard as I maneuver backward and search for another parking spot.\\n\\n After parking in the west lot, far from a certain gang member with a reputation that could scare off even the toughest Fairfield football players, Sierra and I walk up the front steps of Fairfield High. Unfortunately, Alex Fuentes and the rest of his gang friends are hanging by the front doors.\\n\\n \"Walk right past them,\" Sierra mutters. \"Whatever you do, don\u0027t look in their eyes.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s pretty hard not to when Alex Fuentes steps right in front of me and blocks my path.\\n\\n What\u0027s that prayer you\u0027re supposed to say right before you know you\u0027re going to die?\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a lousy driver,\" Alex says with his slight Latino accent and full-blown I-AM-THE-MAN stance.\\n\\n The guy might look like an Abercrombie model with his ripped bod and flawless face, but his picture is more likely to be taken for a mug shot.\\n\\n The kids from the north side don\u0027t really mix with kids from the south side. It\u0027s not that we think we\u0027re better than them, we\u0027re just different. We\u0027ve grown up in the same town, but on totally opposite sides. We live in big houses on Lake Michigan and they live next to the train tracks. We look, talk, act, and dress different. I\u0027m not saying it\u0027s good or bad; it\u0027s just the way it is in Fairfield. And, to be honest, most of the south side girls treat me like Carmen Sanchez does . . . they hate me because of who I am.\\n\\n Or, rather, who they think I am.\\n\\n Alex\u0027s gaze slowly moves down my body, traveling the length of me before moving back up. It\u0027s not the first time a guy has checked me out, it\u0027s just that I never had a guy like Alex do it so blatantly . . . and so up-close. I can feel my face getting hot.\\n\\n \"Next time, watch where you\u0027re goin\u0027,\" he says, his voice cool and controlled.\\n\\n He\u0027s trying to bully me. He\u0027s a pro at this. I won\u0027t let him get to me and win his little game of intimidation, even if my stomach feels like I\u0027m doing one hundred cartwheels in a row. I square my shoulders and sneer at him, the same sneer I use to push people away. \"Thanks for the tip.\"\\n\\n \"If you ever need a real man to teach you how to drive, I can give you lessons.\"\\n\\n Catcalls and whistles from his buddies set my blood boiling.\\n\\n \"If you were a real man, you\u0027d open the door for me instead of blocking my way,\" I say, admiring my own comeback even as my knees threaten to buckle.\\n\\n Alex steps back, pulls the door open, and bows like he\u0027s my butler. He\u0027s totally mocking me, he knows it and I know it. Everyone knows it. I catch a glimpse of Sierra, still desperately searching for nothing in her purse. She\u0027s clueless.\\n\\n \"Get a life,\" I tell him.\\n\\n \"Like yours? Cabrona, let me tell you somethin\u0027,\" Alex says harshly. \"Your life isn\u0027t reality, it\u0027s fake. Just like you.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s better than living my life as a loser,\" I lash out, hoping my words sting as much as his words did. \"Just like you.\"\\n\\n Grabbing Sierra\u0027s arm, I pull her toward the open door. Catcalls and comments follow us as we walk into the school.\\n\\n I finally let out the breath I must have been holding, then turn to Sierra.\\n\\n My best friend is staring at me, all bug-eyed. \"Holy shit, Brit! You got a death wish or something?\"\\n\\n \"What gives Alex Fuentes the right to bully everyone in his path?\"\\n\\n \"Uh, maybe the gun he has hidden in his pants or the gang colors he wears,\" Sierra says, sarcasm dripping from every word.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not stupid enough to carry a gun to school,\" I reason. \"And I refuse to be bullied, by him or anyone else.\" At school, at least. School is the one place I can keep up my \"perfect\" facade; everyone at school buys it. Suddenly pumped about starting my last year at Fairfield, I shake Sierra\u0027s shoulders. \"We\u0027re seniors now,\" I say with the same enthusiasm I use for pom-pom routines during football games. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-2.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) \\n A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers. \\n When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created \u0027perfect\u0027 life is about to unravel before her eyes.
