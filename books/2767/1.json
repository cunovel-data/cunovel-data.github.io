{"id":85995,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"CHAPTER 1 Brittany Everyone knows I\u0027m perfect. My life is perfect. My clothes are perfect. Even my family is perfect. And although it\u0027s a complete lie, I\u0027ve worked my butt off to keep up the appearance that I have it all. The truth, if it were to come out, would destroy my entire picture-perfect image. Standing in front of my bathroom mirror while music blares from my speakers, I wipe away the third crooked line I\u0027ve drawn beneath my eye. My hands are shaking, damn it. Starting senior year of high school and seeing my boyfriend after a summer apart shouldn\u0027t be so nerve-racking, but I\u0027ve gotten off to a disastrous start. First, my curling iron sent up smoke signals and died. Then the button on my favorite shirt popped off. Now, my eyeliner decides it has a mind of its own. If I had any choice in the matter, I\u0027d stay in my comfy bed and eat warm chocolate chip cookies all day. \"Brit, come down,\" I faintly hear my mom yelling from the foyer. My first instinct is to ignore her, but that never gets me anything but arguments, headaches, and more yelling. \"I\u0027ll be there in a sec,\" I call down, hoping I can get this eyeliner to go on straight and be done with it. Finally getting it right, I toss the eyeliner tube on the counter, double and triple check myself in the mirror, turn off my stereo, and hurry down the hallway. My mom is standing at the bottom of our grand staircase, scanning my outfit. I straighten. I know, I know. I\u0027m eighteen and shouldn\u0027t care what my mom thinks. But you haven\u0027t lived in the Ellis house. My mom has anxiety. Not the kind easily controlled with little blue pills. And when my mom is stressed, everyone living with her suffers. I think that\u0027s why my dad goes to work before she gets up in the morning, so he doesn\u0027t have to deal with, well, her. \"Hate the pants, love the belt,\" Mom says, pointing her index finger at each item. \"And that noise you call music was giving me a headache. Thank goodness it\u0027s off.\" \"Good morning to you, too, Mother,\" I say before walking down the stairs and giving her a peck on the cheek. The smell of my mom\u0027s strong perfume stings my nostrils the closer I get. She already looks like a million bucks in her Ralph Lauren Blue Label tennis dress. No one can point a finger and criticize her outfit, that\u0027s for sure. \"I bought your favorite muffin for the first day of school,\" Mom says, pulling out a bag from behind her back. \"No, thanks,\" I say, looking around for my sister. \"Where\u0027s Shelley?\" \"In the kitchen.\" \"Is her new caretaker here yet?\" \"Her name is Baghda, and no. She\u0027s coming in an hour.\" \"Did you tell her wool irritates Shelley\u0027s skin? And that she pulls hair?\" She\u0027s always let it be known in her nonverbal cues she gets irritated by the feeling of wool on her skin. Pulling hair is her new thing, and it has caused a few disasters. Disasters in my house are about as pretty as a car wreck, so avoiding them is crucial. \"Yes. And yes. I gave your sister an earful this morning, Brittany. If she keeps acting up, we\u0027ll find ourselves out of another caretaker.\" I walk into the kitchen, not wanting to hear my mother go on and on about her theories of why Shelley lashes out. Shelley is sitting at the table in her wheelchair, busily eating her specially blended food because, even at the age of twenty, my sister doesn\u0027t have the ability to chew and swallow like people without her physical limitations. As usual, the food has found its way onto her chin, lips, and cheeks. \"Hey, Shell-bell,\" I say, leaning over her and wiping her face with a napkin. \"It\u0027s the first day of school. Wish me luck.\" Shelley holds jerky arms out and gives me a lopsided smile. I love that smile. \"You want to give me a hug?\" I ask her, knowing she does. The doctors always tell us the more interaction Shelley gets, the better off she\u0027ll be. Shelley nods. I fold myself in her arms, careful to keep her hands away from my hair. When I straighten, my mom gasps. It sounds to me like a referee\u0027s whistle, halting my life. \"Brit, you can\u0027t go to school like that.\" \"Like what?\" She shakes her head and sighs in frustration. \"Look at your shirt.\" Glancing down, I see a large wet spot on the front of my white Calvin Klein shirt. Oops. Shelley\u0027s drool. One look at my sister\u0027s drawn face tells me what she can\u0027t easily put into words. Shelley is sorry. Shelley didn\u0027t mean to mess up my outfit. \"It\u0027s no biggie,\" I tell her, although in the back of my mind I know it screws up my \"perfect\" look. Frowning, my mom wets a paper towel at the sink and dabs at the spot. It makes me feel like a two-year-old. \"Go upstairs and change.\" \"Mom, it was just peaches,\" I say, treading carefully so this doesn\u0027t turn into a full-blown yelling match. The last thing I want to do is make my sister feel bad. \"Peaches stain. You don\u0027t want people thinking you don\u0027t care about your appearance.\" \"Fine.\" I wish this was one of my mom\u0027s good days, the days she doesn\u0027t bug me about stuff. I give my sister a kiss on the top of her head, making sure she doesn\u0027t think her drool bothers me in the least. \"I\u0027ll see ya after school,\" I say, attempting to keep the morning cheerful. \"To finish our checker tournament.\" I run back up the stairs, taking two steps at a time. When I get to my bedroom, I check my watch. Oh, no. It\u0027s ten after seven. My best friend, Sierra, is gonna freak out if I\u0027m late picking her up. Grabbing a light blue scarf out of my closet, I pray it\u0027ll work. Maybe nobody will notice the drool spot if I tie it just right. When I come back down the stairs, my mother is standing in the foyer, scanning my appearance again. \"Love the scarf.\" Phew. As I pass her, she shoves the muffin into my hand. \"Eat it on the way.\" I take the muffin. Walking to my car, I absently bite into it. Unfortunately it isn\u0027t blueberry, my favorite. It\u0027s banana nut, and the bananas are overdone. It reminds me of myself--seemingly perfect on the outside, but the inside is all mush. CHAPTER 2 Alex \"Get up, Alex.\" I scowl at my little brother and bury my head under my pillow. Since I share a room with my eleven- and fifteen-year-old brothers, there\u0027s no escape except the little privacy a lone pillow can give. \"Leave me alone, Luis,\" I say roughly through the pillow. \"No estes chingando.\" \"I\u0027m not fuckin\u0027 with you. Mama told me to wake you so you won\u0027t be late for school.\" Senior year. I should be proud I\u0027ll be the first family member in the Fuentes household to graduate high school. But after graduation, real life will start. College is just a dream. Senior year for me is like a retirement party for a sixty-five-year-old. You know you can do more, but everyone expects you to quit. \"I\u0027m all dressed in my new clothes,\" Luis\u0027s proud but muffled voice comes through the pillow. \"The nenas won\u0027t be able to resist this Latino stud.\" \"Good for you,\" I mumble. \"Mama said I should pour this pitcher of water on you if you don\u0027t get up.\" Was privacy too much to ask for? I take my pillow and chuck it across the room. It\u0027s a direct hit. The water splashes all over him. \"Culero!\" he screams at me. \"These are the only new clothes I got.\" A fit of laughter is coming through the bedroom door. Carlos, my other brother, is laughing like a frickin\u0027 hyena. That is, until Luis jumps him. I watch the fight spiral out of control as my younger brothers punch and kick each other. They\u0027re good fighters, I think proudly as I watch them duke it out. But as the oldest male in the house, it\u0027s my duty to break it up. I grab the collar of Garlos\u0027s shirt but trip on Luis\u0027s leg and land on the floor with them. Before I can regain my balance, icy cold water is poured on my back. Turning quickly, I catch mi\u0027ama dousing us all, a bucket poised in her fist above us while she\u0027s wearing her work uniform. She works as a checker for the local grocery store a couple blocks from our house. It doesn\u0027t pay a whole heck of a lot, but we don\u0027t need much. \"Get up,\" she orders, her fiery attitude out in full force. \"Shit, Ma,\" Carlos says, standing. Mi\u0027amd takes what\u0027s left in her bucket, sticks her fingers in the icy water, and flicks the liquid in Carlos\u0027s face. Luis laughs and before he knows it, he gets flicked with water as well. Will they ever learn? \"Any more attitude, Luis?\" she asks. \"No, ma\u0027am,\" Luis says, standing as straight as a soldier. \"You have any more filthy words to come out of that boca of yours, Carlos?\" She dips her hand in the water as a warning. \"No, ma\u0027am,\" echoes soldier number two. \"And what about you, Alejandro?\" Her eyes narrow into slits as she focuses on me. \"What? I was tryin\u0027 to break it up,\" I say innocently, giving her my you-can\u0027t-resist-me smile. She flicks water in my face. \"That\u0027s for not breaking it up sooner. Now get dressed, all of you, and come eat breakfast before school.\" So much for my you-can\u0027t-resist-me smile. \"You know you love us,\" I call after her as she leaves our room. After a quick shower, I walk back to my bedroom with a towel wrapped around my waist. I catch sight of Luis with one of my bandannas on his head and my gut tightens. I yank it off him. \"Don\u0027t ever touch this, Luis.\" \"Why not?\" he asks, his deep brown eyes all innocent. To Luis, it\u0027s a bandanna. To me, it\u0027s a symbol of what is and will never be. How the hell am I supposed to explain it to an eleven-year-old kid? He knows what I am. It\u0027s no secret the bandanna has the Latino Blood colors on it. Payback and revenge got me in and now there\u0027s no way out. But I\u0027ll die before I let one of my brothers get sucked in. I ball the bandanna in my fist. \"Luis, don\u0027t touch my shit. Especially my Blood stuff.\" \"I like red and black.\" That\u0027s the last thing I need to hear. \"If I ever catch you wearin\u0027 it again, you\u0027ll be sportin\u0027 black and blue,\" I tell him. \"Got it, little brother?\" He shrugs. \"Yeah. I got it.\" As he leaves the room with a spring in his step, I wonder if he really does get it. I stop myself from thinking too hard about it as I grab a black T-shirt from my dresser and pull on worn, faded jeans. When I tie my bandanna around my head, I hear mi\u0027ama\u0027s voice bellowing from the kitchen. \"Alejandro, come eat before the food gets cold. De prisa, hurry up.\" \"I\u0027m comin\u0027,\" I call back. I\u0027ll never understand why food is such an important part of her life. My brothers are already busy chowing down on their breakfast when I enter the kitchen. I open the refrigerator and scan its contents. \"Sit down.\" \"Ma, I\u0027ll just grab--\" \"You\u0027ll grab nothing, Alejandro. Sit. We\u0027re a family and we\u0027re going to eat like one.\" I sigh, close the refrigerator door, and sit beside Carlos. Sometimes being a member of a close family has its disadvantages. Mi\u0027ama places a heaping plate of huevos and tortillas in front of me. \"Why can\u0027t you call me Alex?\" I ask, my head down while I stare at the food in front of me. \"If I wanted to call you Alex, I wouldn\u0027t have bothered to name you Alejandro. Don\u0027t you like your given name?\" My muscles tense. I was named after a father who is no longer alive, leaving me the responsibility of being the designated man of the house. Alejandro, Alejandro Jr., Junior . . . it\u0027s all the same to me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-1.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.
