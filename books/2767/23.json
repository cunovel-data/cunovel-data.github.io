{"id":86017,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"Except Brittany. I scan the area, but she\u0027s not around. \"I didn\u0027t do it,\" Lucky is quick to say. Everyone else murmurs they didn\u0027t do it, either. Then murmurs of who it could be race through the crowd. \"Colin Adams, Greg Hanson . . .\" I\u0027m not listening, because I know full well who the culprit is. It\u0027s my chem partner, the one who ignored me today. I yank off the streamers with a jerk of my hand, then unscrew the pink rubber horn. Pink. I wonder if it was hers once upon a time. \"Get out of my way,\" I tell the crowd. They disperse pretty quick, thinking my rage level is high and they don\u0027t want to be caught in the crossfire. Sometimes playing the part of a badass does have its advantages. The truth? I\u0027ll use the pink horn and streamers as an excuse to talk to Brittany again. After everyone is out of sight, I walk to the side of the football field. The pom squad is there, practicing as usual. \"Looking for someone?\" I turn around to Darlene Boehm, one of Brittany\u0027s friends. \"Is Brittany around?\" I ask. \"Nope.\" \"Know where she is?\" Alex Fuentes asking the whereabouts of Brittany Ellis? I expect her to say it\u0027s none of my business. Or that I should leave her alone. Instead her friend says, \"She went home.\" Murmuring a \"thanks,\" I turn and walk back to Julio while I dial my cousin\u0027s number. \"Enrique\u0027s Auto Body.\" \"It\u0027s Alex. I\u0027m gonna be late for work today.\" \"You get another detention?\" \"No, nothin\u0027 like that.\" \"Well, make sure you work on the Lexus for Chuy. I told him he could pick it up at seven and you know how Chuy is when you don\u0027t come through for him.\" \"No problem,\" I tell him as I think of Chuy\u0027s role in the Blood. He\u0027s the guy you never want to mess with, the guy who was born without an empathy chip in his brain. If someone is disloyal, Chuy is responsible for either making them loyal or making sure they never narc. By any means possible, even if they\u0027re screaming for their life. \"I\u0027ll be there.\" Knocking on the Ellises\u0027 door ten minutes later with the pink horn and streamers in hand, I try to put on the I-am-a-cool-motherfucker pose. When Brittany opens the door wearing a baggy T-shirt and shorts, I\u0027m floored. Her pale blue eyes open wide. \"Alex, what are you doing here?\" I hold out the horn and streamers. She snatches them from my hand. \"I can\u0027t believe you came here because of some prank.\" \"We\u0027ve got some things to discuss. Besides pranks.\" She swallows nervously. \"I\u0027m not feeling great, okay? Let\u0027s just talk at school.\" She tries to close the door. Shit, I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m going to do this like a stalker guy in the movies. I push open the door. Que mierda! \"Alex, don\u0027t.\" \"Let me in. For a minute. Please.\" She shakes her head, those angelic curls swaying back and forth across her face. \"My parents don\u0027t like when I have people over.\" \"Are they home?\" \"No.\" She sighs, then opens the door hesitantly. I step inside. The house is even bigger than it looks from the outside. The walls are painted bright white, reminding me of a hospital. I swear dust wouldn\u0027t have the nerve to land on their floors or counters. The two-story foyer boasts a staircase that rivals the one I saw in The Sound of Music, which we were forced to watch in junior high, and the floor is as shiny as water. Brittany was right. I don\u0027t belong here. It doesn\u0027t matter, because even if I don\u0027t belong in this place, she\u0027s here and I want to be where she is. \"Well, what did you want to talk about?\" she asks. I wish her long, lean legs weren\u0027t sticking out from her shorts. They\u0027re a distraction. I look away from them, desperate to keep my wits. So what if she has sexy legs? So what if she has eyes as clear as glass marbles? So what if she can take a prank like a man and give it right back? Who am I kidding? I have no reason for being here other than the fact that I want to be near her. Screw the bet. I want to know how to make this girl laugh. I want to know what makes her cry. I want to know what it feels like to have her look at me as if I\u0027m her knight in shining armor. \"Bwiee!\" a distant voice echoes through the house, breaking the silence. \"Wait here,\" Brittany orders, then hurries down a hallway to the right. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" I\u0027m not about to stand here like a jackass in the foyer. I follow her, knowing I\u0027m about to get a glimpse into her private world. CHAPTER 29 Brittany I\u0027m not ashamed of my sister\u0027s disability. But I don\u0027t want Alex to judge her. Because if he laughs, I couldn\u0027t take it. I whip around. \"You\u0027re not good at following directions, are you?\" He grins as if saying, I\u0027m a gang member, what did you expect? \"I have to check on my sister. Do you mind?\" \"Nope. It\u0027ll give me a chance to meet her. Trust me.\" I should kick him out, tattoos and all. I should, but I don\u0027t. Without another word, I lead him into our dark, mahogany-paneled library. Shelley is sitting in her wheelchair, her head awkwardly slumped to the side as she watches television. When she realizes she has company, her gaze shifts from the television to me to Alex. \"This is Alex,\" I explain, shutting off the TV. \"A friend from school.\" Shelley gives Alex a crooked smile and hits her specialized keyboard with her knuckles. \"Hello,\" says a feminine, computerized voice. She hits another button. \"My name is Shelley,\" the computer continues. Alex kneels down to Shelley\u0027s level. The simple act of respect tears at something suspiciously like my heart. Colin always ignores my sister, treating her as if she\u0027s blind and deaf as well as physically and mentally disabled. \"What\u0027s up?\" Alex says, taking Shelley\u0027s stiff hand in his and shaking it. \"Cool computer.\" \"It\u0027s a personal communication device or PCD,\" I explain. \"It helps her communicate.\" \"Game,\" the computer voice says. Alex moves beside Shelley. I hold my breath as I watch her hands, making sure they\u0027re nowhere near his thick head of hair. \"You have games on there?\" he asks. \"Yeah,\" I answer for her. \"She\u0027s become a checkers fanatic. Shelley, show him how it works.\" While Shelley slowly taps the screen with her knuckles, Alex watches, seemingly fascinated. When the checkers screen comes up, Shelley nudges Alex\u0027s hand. \"You go first,\" he says. She shakes her head. \"She wants you to go first,\" I tell him. \"Cool.\" He taps the screen. I watch, getting all mushy inside, as this tough guy plays quietly with my big sister. \"Do you mind if I make a snack for her?\" I say, desperate to leave the room. \"Nah, go ahead,\" he says, his concentration on the game. \"You don\u0027t have to let her win,\" I say before leaving. \"She can hold her own in checkers.\" \"Uh, thanks for the vote of confidence, but I am tryin\u0027 to win,\" Alex says. He has a genuine grin on his face, without trying to act cocky or cool. It makes me even more desperate to escape. When I walk into the library with Shelley\u0027s food a few minutes later, he says, \"She beat me.\" \"I told you she was good. But enough games for now,\" I say to Shelley, then turn to Alex. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind me helping to feed her.\" \"Go for it.\" He sits in my dad\u0027s favorite leather chair as I place a tray in front of Shelley and feed her applesauce. It\u0027s a messy affair, as usual. Tilting my head, I catch Alex watching as I wipe the side of my sister\u0027s mouth with a towel. \"Shelley,\" I say. \"You should\u0027ve let him win. You know, to be polite.\" Shelley\u0027s response is a shake of her head. Applesauce drips on her chin. \"That\u0027s the way it\u0027s going to be, huh?\" I say, hoping the scene doesn\u0027t gross Alex out. Maybe I\u0027m testing him, to see if he can handle a glimpse of my home life. If so, he\u0027s passing. \"Wait until Alex leaves. I\u0027ll show you who the checkers champion is.\" My sister smiles that sweet, crooked smile of hers. It\u0027s like a thousand words put into one expression. For a moment I forget Alex is still watching me. It\u0027s so weird having him inside my life and my house. He doesn\u0027t belong, yet he doesn\u0027t seem to mind being here. \"Why were you in a crappy mood in chem class?\" he asks. Because my sister is going to be sent away and yesterday I got caught with my boobs exposed while Colin had his pants down right in front of me. \"I\u0027m sure you heard the gruesome rumors.\" \"Nope, haven\u0027t heard a thing. Maybe you\u0027re just paranoid.\" Maybe. Shane saw us, but he has a big mouth. Every time someone looked my way today, I imagined they knew. I look at Alex. \"Sometimes I wish there were Do Over Days.\" \"Sometimes I wish there were Do Over Years,\" he responds seriously. \"Or Fast Forward Days.\" \"Unfortunately, real life doesn\u0027t have a remote control.\" When Shelley is done eating, I sit her in front of the TV, then lead Alex to the kitchen. \"My life doesn\u0027t seem so perfect after all, does it?\" I ask while I take drinks out of the fridge for both of us. Alex looks at me curiously. \"What?\" He shrugs. \"I guess we all have stuff to deal with. I\u0027ve got more demons than a horror movie.\" Demons? Nothing bothers Alex. He never complains about his life. \"What are your demons?\" I ask. \"Oye, if I told you about my demons, you\u0027d run like hell away from me.\" \"I think you\u0027d be surprised what I\u0027d run from, Alex.\" Chimes from our grandfather clock echo through the house. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. \"I gotta go,\" Alex says. \"How about studying tomorrow, after school. At my house.\" \"Your house?\" On the south side? \"I\u0027ll show you a glimpse into my life. You game?\" he asks. I swallow. \"Sure.\" Game on. As I lead him to the door, I hear a car drive up to my house. If it\u0027s my mom, I\u0027m in big trouble. No matter if we had the most innocent meeting, she\u0027ll go ballistic. I peek through the windows by the front door and recognize Darlene\u0027s red sports car. \"Oh, no. My friends are here.\" \"Don\u0027t panic,\" he tells me. \"Open the door. It\u0027s not like you can pretend I\u0027m not here. My motorcycle is parked in your driveway.\" He\u0027s right. I can\u0027t hide the fact that he\u0027s here. I open the door and walk outside. Alex is right behind me as I face Darlene, Morgan, and Sierra walking up the sidewalk. \"Hey, guys!\" I say. Maybe if I act all innocent they won\u0027t make a big deal about Alex being here. I touch Alex\u0027s elbow. \"We were just discussing our chemistry project. Right, Alex?\" \"Right.\" Sierra\u0027s eyebrows are raised. I think Morgan is about to pull out her cell, no doubt to inform the other M\u0027s she saw Alex Fuentes walking out of my house. \"Should we go so you guys can be alone?\" Darlene asks. \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" I say too quickly. Alex steps toward his motorcycle, his shirt outlining his perfect, muscular back and his jeans outlining his perfect, muscular-- He points at me after putting on his helmet. \"See ya tomorrow.\" Tomorrow. His house.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-23.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.
