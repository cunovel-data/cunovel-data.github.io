{"id":86038,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"Letting my sister choose her own path was hard, but I did it. And I didn\u0027t freak out. Knowing it was Shelley\u0027s choice made me feel so much better. But now I\u0027m alone. Alex took a piece of my heart with him when he left. I\u0027m guarding what I have left with a vengeance. I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that the only life I\u0027m going to control is my own. Alex chose his path. It didn\u0027t include me. I ignore Alex\u0027s friends at school, and they ignore me. We all pretend the beginning of senior year didn\u0027t actually happen. Except Isabel. We talk sometimes, but it\u0027s painful. We have a silent understanding between us, and it\u0027s helped make me feel like I have someone going through the same sort of pain I\u0027m dealing with. Opening my locker before chemistry class in May, I notice a pair of hand warmers hanging on the hooks inside. The worst night of my life comes crashing back to me full force. Has Alex been here? Did he place the hand warmers in the locker himself? As much as I want to forget him, I can\u0027t. I read that goldfish have a memory of five seconds. I envy them. My memory of Alex, my love for him, will last my lifetime. I clutch the soft hand warmers to my chest and kneel beside my locker, crying. Ugh. I\u0027m a shell of a person. Sierra stands at my feet. \"Brit, what\u0027s wrong?\" I\u0027m unable to move. Unable to pull myself together. \"Come on,\" Sierra says, pulling me up. \"Everybody\u0027s watching.\" Darlene walks by us. \"Seriously, isn\u0027t it time you got over your gang-banger boyfriend who dumped you? You\u0027re starting to look pathetic,\" she says, making sure the crowd gathering around us hears her. Colin appears beside Darlene. He scowls at me. \"Alex deserved what he got,\" he hisses. Whether it\u0027s right or wrong, fight for what you believe in. My hands are already in fists when I swing at him. He dodges the punch, then grabs my wrist and twists it behind my back. Doug steps forward. \"Let her go, Colin.\" \"Stay out of this, Thompson.\" \"Dude, humiliating her because she dumped you for another guy is plain lame.\" Colin pushes me aside and pulls up his sleeves. I can\u0027t allow Doug to fight my battle. \"If you want to fight him, you\u0027ll have to get past me first,\" I say. To my surprise, Isabel steps in front of me. \"And you\u0027ll have to get past me to get to her.\" Sierra takes a place beside Isabel. \"And me, too.\" A Mexican guy named Sam pushes Gary Frankel next to Isabel. \"This guy can break your arm with one snap, asshole. Get out of my sight before I sic him on you,\" Sam says. Gary, who\u0027s wearing a coral shirt and white pants, growls to look tough. It doesn\u0027t work. Colin looks left and right for support but can\u0027t find any. I blink in disbelief. Maybe the universe was in disarray before, but now it\u0027s back in alignment. \"Come on, Colin,\" Darlene orders. \"We don\u0027t need these pathetic lame-o\u0027s anyway.\" They walk off together. I almost feel sorry for them. Almost. \"I\u0027m so proud of you, Douggie,\" Sierra says, throwing herself on him. They start making out immediately, not caring who\u0027s watching or about Fairfield\u0027s PDA policy. \"I love you,\" Doug says when they come up for air. \"I love you, too,\" Sierra coos in a baby voice. \"Get a room,\" another classmate calls out. But they keep kissing until music plays from the loudspeakers. The crowd disperses. I\u0027m still clutching the hand warmers. Isabel kneels next to me. \"I never told Paco how I felt, you know. I never took the risk, and now it\u0027s too late.\" \"I\u0027m so sorry, Isa. I took the risk and lost Alex anyway, so maybe you\u0027re better off.\" She shrugs, and I know she\u0027s trying to keep it together so she doesn\u0027t break down at school. \"I suppose I\u0027ll get over it one day. It\u0027s not likely, but I can hope, can\u0027t I?\" She straightens her shoulders and stands, putting on a brave front. I watch as she walks to class, wondering if she talks about it with her other friends or if she confides only in me. \"Come on,\" Sierra says, unlocking herself from Doug\u0027s embrace and pulling me toward the school exit. I wipe my eyes with the back of my hand and sit on the curb beside Sierra\u0027s car, not caring that I\u0027m ditching class. \"I\u0027m fine, Sierra. Really.\" \"No, you\u0027re not fine. Brit, I\u0027m your best friend. I\u0027ll be here before and after your boyfriends. So spill your guts. I\u0027m all ears.\" \"I loved him.\" \"No shit, Sherlock. Tell me something I don\u0027t know.\" \"He used me. He had sex with me to win a bet. And I still love him. Sierra, I am pathetic.\" \"You had sex and didn\u0027t tell me? I mean, I thought it was a rumor. You know, of the untrue kind.\" I lean my head in my hands in frustration. \"I\u0027m just kidding. I don\u0027t even want to know. Okay, I do, but only if you want to tell me,\" Sierra says. \"Forget about that now. I saw the way Alex always looked at you, Brit. That\u0027s why I laid off you for liking him. There was no way he was acting. I don\u0027t know who told you about a supposed bet--\" I look up. \"He did. And his friends confirmed it. Why can\u0027t I let him go?\" Sierra shakes her head, as if erasing the words I\u0027ve said. \"First things first.\" She grabs my chin and forces me to look at her. \u0027Alex had feelings for you, whether he admitted it to you or not, whether there was a bet or not. You know that, Brit, or you wouldn\u0027t be clutching those hand warmers like that. Second of all, Alex is out of your life and you owe it to yourself, to his goofy friend Paco, and to me to keep plugging along even if it\u0027s not easy.\" \"I can\u0027t help but think he pushed me away on purpose. If I could only talk to him, I can get answers.\" \"Maybe he doesn\u0027t have the answers. That\u0027s why he left. If he wants to give up on life, to ignore what\u0027s right in front of him, so be it. But you show him that you\u0027re stronger than that.\" Sierra is right. For the first time I feel I can make it through the rest of senior year. Alex took a piece of my heart that night we made love, and he\u0027ll forever hold it. But that doesn\u0027t mean my life has to be on hold indefinitely. I can\u0027t run after ghosts. I\u0027m stronger now. At least, I hope I am. Two weeks later I\u0027m the last one in the locker room to change for gym. The click of heels makes me look up. It\u0027s Carmen Sanchez. I don\u0027t freak out. Instead, I stand and look right at her. \"He was back in Fairfield, you know,\" she tells me. \"I know,\" I say, remembering the hand warmers in my locker. But he left. Like a whisper, he was there and then disappeared. She looks almost nervous, vulnerable. \"You know those giant stuffed-animal prizes at the carnival? The kind practically nobody wins, except the lucky few? I\u0027ve never won one.\" \"Yeah. I\u0027ve never won one, either.\" \"Alex was my giant prize. I hated you for taking him away,\" she admits. I shrug. \"Yeah, well, stop hating me. I don\u0027t have him, either.\" \"I don\u0027t hate you anymore,\" she says. \"I\u0027ve moved on.\" I swallow and then say, \"Me, too.\" Carmen chuckles. Then, just as she walks out of the room, I hear her mumble, \"Alex sure as hell hasn\u0027t.\" What\u0027s that supposed to mean? Brittany Five Months Later The smell of August in Colorado is definitely different from the smell in Illinois. I shake out my new, short hairstyle, not even bothering to smooth the frizzies down as I attempt to unpack boxes in my dorm room at the university. My roommate, Lexie, is from Arkansas. She\u0027s like a little pixie, short and sweet; she could definitely pass for one of Tinkerbell\u0027s descendents. I swear I\u0027ve never seen her frown. Sierra, at the University of Illinois, wasn\u0027t so lucky with her roommate, Dara. The girl has divided the closet and room into separate quarters and gets up at 5:30 a.m. every day (even weekends) to work out in their dorm room. Sierra is miserable, but she\u0027s spending most of her time in Doug\u0027s dorm room so it\u0027s not too bad. \"Ya sure you don\u0027t want t\u0027go with us?\" Lexie asks me, her Southern drawl flowing from each word. She\u0027s going with a bunch of other freshman girls to the quad, where there\u0027s some kind of welcome party. \"I\u0027ve got to finish unpacking, then I\u0027m going to see my sister. I promised her I\u0027d visit as soon as I unpacked.\" \"Okay,\" Lexie says, pulling out and trying on clothes to get the \"perfect look\" for tonight. When she finds an outfit, she fixes her hair and touches up her makeup. It makes me think of the old me, the one who tried so hard to meet everyone\u0027s expectations. When Lexie leaves a half hour later, I sit on my bed and pull out my cell phone. Flipping it open, I stare at the picture of Alex and me. I hate myself for having the urge to look at it. So many times I\u0027ve tried to force myself to delete the pictures, erase the past. But I can\u0027t. I reach into my desk drawer and pull out Alex\u0027s bandanna, fresh and clean and folded up neatly into a square. I touch the smooth material, remembering when Alex gave it to me. To me, it doesn\u0027t represent the Latino Blood. It represents Alex. My cell rings, bringing me back to the present. It\u0027s someone from Sunny Acres. When I answer it, a woman\u0027s voice is on the other end of the line. \"Is this Brittany Ellis?\" \"Yes.\" \"This is Georgia Jackson, from Sunny Acres. Everything is just fine with Shelley, but she wanted to know if you\u0027d be here before or after dinner.\" I look at my watch. It\u0027s four thirty. \"Tell her I\u0027ll be there in fifteen minutes. I\u0027m leaving now.\" After I hang up, I place the bandanna back in my desk drawer and shove the phone into my purse. Taking the bus to the other side of town doesn\u0027t take long, and before I know it I\u0027m walking toward the lounge at Sunny Acres where the receptionist said my sister was. I spot Georgia Jackson first. She\u0027s been the link between Shelley and me when I call to ask about her every few days. Her friendly and warm welcome greets me. \"Where\u0027s Shelley?\" I ask, scanning the room. \"Playing checkers, as usual,\" Georgia says, pointing to the corner. Shelley isn\u0027t facing me, but I recognize the back of her head and her wheelchair. She\u0027s squealing, a hint that she won the game. As I get closer to her, I catch a glimpse of who\u0027s playing against her. The dark hair should have been a clue that my life is about to be turned upside down, but it doesn\u0027t fully register. I freeze. It can\u0027t be. My imagination must be going berserk. But when he turns around and those familiar dark eyes pierce mine, reality zings up my spine like a lightning bolt. Alex is here. Ten steps away from me. Oh, God, every feeling I\u0027ve ever had for him comes rushing back like a tidal wave. I don\u0027t know what to do or say. I turn back to Georgia, wondering if she knew Alex was here. One look at her hopeful face tells me she did. \"Brittany\u0027s here,\" I hear him tell Shelley before he stands and carefully turns her wheelchair around so she can face me. Like a robot, I walk toward my sister and wrap her in a hug. When I release her, Alex is standing in front of me, wearing khaki chinos and a blue-checkered button-down shirt. I can only stare at him, my stomach doing weird flip-flops, making me queasy. The world recedes at the edges, and all I can see is him. I finally find my voice. \"A-Alex . . . ? W-what are you doing here?\" I ask, all tongue-tied. He shrugs. \"I promised Shelley a rematch, didn\u0027t I?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-44.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.
