{"id":86028,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"Oh, please. What bullshit. Perry puts his arm around her and I\u0027m tempted to pick a fight in the middle of the gallery. \"I can tell you\u0027re very deep.\" Deep, my ass. He wants to get into her pants . . . pants he\u0027s never going near if I have anything to say about it. \"Alex, what do you think?\" Brittany asks, turning to me. \"Well ...\" I rub my chin as I stare at the painting. \"I think the entire collection is worth a buck fifty, two tops.\" Sierra\u0027s eyes go wide and her hand covers her mouth in shock. Doug is coughing up his drink. And Brittany? I look at my \"let\u0027s see what happens\" girlfriend. \"Alex, you owe Perry an apology,\" Brittany says. Yeah, right after he apologizes for asking me about wasabi. Not a chance in hell. \"I\u0027m outta here,\" I say, then turn my back on all of them and walk out the gallery door. Me voy. Outside, I bum a cigarette from a waitress across the street who\u0027s on break. All I can think about is how Brittany looked as she ordered me to apologize. I do not take orders well. Damn, I hated watching that asshole artist put his arm around my girl. I\u0027m sure every guy wants to put his hands on her in some way, to claim they\u0027ve touched her. I want to touch her, too, but I also want her to want only me. Not order me around like some puppy dog and only hold hands with me when she\u0027s not putting on a show. This is definitely not turning out like it\u0027s supposed to. \"I saw you come out of the gallery. Only hoiteys go in there,\" the waitress says after I hand back her lighter. Wasabi. Now hoiteys. Seriously, you\u0027d think I really didn\u0027t know English. \"Hoiteys?\" \"Hoitey-toitey types. You know, white-collar stiffs.\" \"Yeah, well, I\u0027m definitely not one of those. More like a blue collar who followed a bunch of hoiteys in there.\" I take a long drag, thankful for nicotine. I feel calmer immediately. Okay, so my lungs are probably shriveled up, but I have a good idea I\u0027ll probably die before my lungs decide to quit on me. \"I\u0027m Blue-Collar Mandy,\" the waitress says, holding out her hand and flashing me a smile. She\u0027s got light brown hair streaked with purple. She\u0027s cute, but she\u0027s no Brittany. I shake her hand. \"Alex.\" She eyes my tattoos. \"I\u0027ve got two. Wanna see?\" Not really. I have a feeling she got drunk one night and tattooed her chest... or ass. \"Alex!\" Brittany yells my name from the front of the gallery. I\u0027m still smoking and trying to forget that she brought me here because I\u0027m her dirty little secret. I don\u0027t want to be a fucking secret anymore. My pseudo-girlfriend crosses the street. Her designer shoes click on the pavement, reminding me she\u0027s a class above. She eyes Mandy and me, the two blue collars, smoking together. \"Mandy here was about to show me her tattoos,\" I tell Brittany to piss her off. \"I\u0027ll bet she was. Were you going to show her yours, too?\" She eyes me accusingly. \"I\u0027m not into drama,\" Mandy says. She throws down her cigarette and smashes it with the tip of her gym shoe. \"Good luck, you two. God knows you need it.\" I take another drag while wishing Brittany didn\u0027t tempt me like she does. \"Go back to the gallery, querida. I\u0027ll take a bus home.\" \"I thought we\u0027d have a nice day together, Alex, in a town where nobody knows us. Don\u0027t you want to be anonymous sometimes?\" \"You think it\u0027s nice havin\u0027 that little piece of shit artist thinkin\u0027 I\u0027m the busboy? I\u0027d rather be known as the gangbanger than the immigrant busboy.\" \"You didn\u0027t even give it a chance. If you\u0027d relax and take that chip off your shoulder, you could fit in. You can be one of them.\" \"Everyone is plastic in there. Even you. Wake up, Miss Omigod! I don\u0027t want to be one of them. Get it? !Entiendes?\" \"Loud and clear. For your information, I am not plastic. You can call it that, but we call it considerate and polite.\" \"In your social circles, not mine. In my circles, we tell it like it is. And never, ever order me to apologize like you\u0027re my mother. I swear, Brittany, the next time you do that we\u0027re done.\" Oh, man. Her eyes are getting all glassy. She turns her back to me and I want to kick myself for hurting her. I put out my cigarette. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to be a dickhead. Well, I did. But that\u0027s \u0027cause I didn\u0027t feel comfortable in there.\" She\u0027s not looking at me. Reaching out to rub her back, I\u0027m thankful she doesn\u0027t shy away from me. I continue talking. \"Brittany, I love hangin\u0027 with you. Shit, when I get to school I scan the halls lookin\u0027 for you. As soon as I catch sight of these angelic streaks of sunshine,\" I say, fingering her hair, \"I know I can make it through the day.\" \"I\u0027m no angel.\" \"You are to me. If you forgive me, I\u0027ll go back and apologize to that artist guy.\" She opens her eyes. \"Really?\" \"Yeah. I don\u0027t want to do it. But I will ... for you.\" Her mouth curves into a small smile. \"Don\u0027t do it. I appreciate you saying you\u0027ll do it for me, but you\u0027re right. His art did suck.\" \"There you guys are,\" Sierra says. \"We\u0027ve been looking all over for you lovebirds. Let\u0027s hit the road and get to the cabin already.\" At the cabin, Doug claps his hands together. \"Hot tub or movie?\" he asks. Sierra walks over to the window overlooking the lake. \"I\u0027ll fall asleep if we put a movie on.\" I\u0027m sitting with Brittany on the couch in the living room, reeling over the fact that this huge house is Doug\u0027s second home. It\u0027s bigger than the one house I live in. And a hot tub? Jeez, rich people have it all. \"I don\u0027t have a bathin\u0027 suit,\" I tell them. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Brittany says. \"Doug probably has one in the pool house you can wear.\" In the pool house, Doug looks through a drawer searching for suits. \"There\u0027s only two here.\" Doug picks up a skimpy Speedo and holds it out to me. \"This okay for you, big guy?\" \"That wouldn\u0027t fit my right testicle. Why don\u0027t you wear it and I\u0027ll take this one,\" I say, reaching around Doug and grabbing a boxer-type suit. I notice the girls are gone. \"Where\u0027d they go?\" \"To change. And to talk about us, I\u0027m sure.\" In the small changing room as I strip and get into the suit, I think about my life back home. Here, in Lake Geneva, it\u0027s easy to forget about home life for a while. Not having to worry about who\u0027s got my back. When I step out of the changing room, Doug says, \"She\u0027ll take a lot of shit by being with you, you know. People are already starting to talk.\" \"Listen, Douggie. I like that girl more than I can remember likin\u0027 anything in my life. I\u0027m not about to give her up. I\u0027ll start carin\u0027 about what other people think when I\u0027m six feet under.\" Doug smiles and holds out his arms. \"Ah, Fuentes, I think we just had a male bonding moment. Wanna hug?\" \"Not on your life, white boy.\" Doug slaps me on the back, then we walk to the hot tub. Despite everything, I think we do have, if not a bonding, then at least an understanding. Either way, I\u0027m still not hugging him. \"Very sexy, babe,\" Sierra says, eyeing Doug\u0027s Speedo. Doug is walking like a penguin, waddling while trying to get comfortable. \"I swear to God I\u0027m taking these off as soon as I get in the hot tub. They\u0027re choking my balls.\" \"TMI,\" Brittany chimes in, covering her ears with her palms. She\u0027s wearing a yellow bikini, leaving very little to the imagination. Does she realize she looks like a sunflower, ready to rain sunshine on all who look down upon her? Doug and Sierra climb into the tub. I hop into the tub and sit beside Brittany. I\u0027ve never been in a hot tub before, and am not sure about hot-tub protocol. Are we going to sit here and talk, or do we break off into couples and make out? I like the second option, but Brittany looks nervous. Especially when Doug tosses his Speedo out of the tub. I wince. \"Come on, man.\" \"What? I want to be able to have kids one day, Fuentes. That thing was cutting off my circulation.\" Brittany hops out of the tub and pulls a towel around her. \"Let\u0027s go inside, Alex.\" \"You guys can stay in here,\" Sierra says. \"I\u0027ll make him put the marble bag back on.\" \"Forget it. You two enjoy the tub. We\u0027ll be inside,\" Brittany says. When I\u0027m out of the tub, Brittany hands me an extra towel. I put my arm around her as we walk to the cabin. \"You okay?\" \"Absolutely. I was thinking you were upset.\" \"I\u0027m cool. But. . .\" Inside, I pick up a blown-glass figurine and study it. \"Seein\u0027 this house, this life ... I want to be here with you, but I look around and realize this will never be me.\" \"You\u0027re thinking too much.\" She kneels on the carpet and pats the floor. \"Come here and lie on your stomach. I know how to give Swedish massages. It\u0027ll relax you.\" \"You\u0027re not Swedish,\" I say. \"Yeah, well, neither are you. So if I do it wrong you\u0027ll never know the difference.\" I lie next to her. \"I thought we were gonna take this relationship slow.\" \"A back rub is harmless.\" My eyes roam over her kick-ass bikini-covered bod. \"I\u0027ll have you know I\u0027ve been intimate with girls wearin\u0027 a lot more.\" She slaps me on the butt. \"Behave yourself.\" When her hands move over my back, I let out a groan. Man, this is torture. I\u0027m trying to behave, but her hands feel too damn good and my body has a mind of its own. \"You\u0027re tense,\" she says in my ear. Of course I\u0027m tense. Her hands are all over me. My answer is another groan. After a few minutes of Brittany\u0027s mind-numbing massage, loud moaning, groaning, and grunting from the hot tub floats into the room. Doug and Sierra have obviously skipped the back rub portion of the evening. \"Do you think they\u0027re doing it?\" she asks. \"Either that, or Doug\u0027s a very religious guy,\" I say, referring to the guy screaming Oh, God! every two seconds. \"Does it make you horny?\" she sings quietly into my ear. \"No, but you keep massagin\u0027 me like that and you can forget about that goin\u0027 slow bullshit.\" I sit up and face her. \"What I can\u0027t figure out is if you know you\u0027re a tease and are fuckin\u0027 with me or whether you really are innocent.\" \"I\u0027m not a tease.\" I cock an eyebrow, then look down at my upper thigh where she\u0027s parked her hand. She snatches it away. \"Okay, I didn\u0027t mean to put my hand there. Well, I mean, not really. It just kinda . . . wh . . . what I mean to say is--\" \"I like it when you stutter,\" I say as I pull her down next to me and show her my own version of a Swedish massage until we\u0027re interrupted by Sierra and Doug. Two weeks later, I get word that I have a court date for my gun possession charge. I hide the info from Brittany, because she\u0027d freak out. She\u0027d probably go on and on about how a public defender isn\u0027t as good as a private lawyer. The thing is, I can\u0027t afford a fancy lawyer. As I\u0027m worrying about my fate while I\u0027m hanging by the front doors before school, I\u0027m suddenly sideswiped by someone and almost lose my balance. \"What the hell?\" I push back. \"Sorry,\" the guy says nervously. I realize the guy is none other than White Guy from the jail cell.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-34.html","bookId":2767,"book":{"id":2767,"title":"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1)","description":"Storyline: Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry #1) A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.
