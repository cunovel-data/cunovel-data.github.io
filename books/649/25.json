{"id":11091,"no":25,"title":"SECTION 24.","content":"The time came for Mary to take her departure, and Hal got up, wincing with pain, to escort her home. She regarded him gravely, having not realised before how seriously he was suffering. As they walked along she asked, “Why do ye do such work, when ye don\u0027t have to?” “But I do have to! I have to earn a living!” “Ye don\u0027t have to earn it that way! A bright young fellow like you—an American!” “Well,” said Hal, “I thought it would be interesting to see coal mining.” “Now ye\u0027ve seen it,” said the girl—“now quit!” “But it won\u0027t do me any harm to go on for a while!” “Won\u0027t it? How can ye know? When any day they may carry you out on a plank!” Her “company manner” was gone; her voice was full of bitterness, as it always was when she spoke of North Valley. “I know what I\u0027m tellin\u0027 ye, Joe Smith. Didn\u0027t I lose two brothers in it—as fine lads as ye\u0027d find anywhere in the world! And many another lad I\u0027ve seen go in laughin\u0027, and come out a corpse—or what is worse, for workin\u0027 people, a cripple. Sometimes I\u0027d like to go and stand at the pit-mouth in the mornin\u0027 and cry to them, \u0027Go back, go back! Go down the canyon this day! Starve, if ye have to, beg if ye have to, only find some other work but coal-minin\u0027!\u0027” Her voice had risen to a passion of protest; when she went on a new note came into it—a note of personal terror. “It\u0027s worse now—since you came, Joe! To see ye settin\u0027 out on the life of a miner—you, that are young and strong and different. Oh, go away, Joe, go away while ye can!” He was astonished at her intensity. “Don\u0027t worry about me, Mary,” he said. “Nothing will happen to me. I\u0027ll go away after a while.” The path was irregular, and he had been holding her arm as they walked. He felt her trembling, and went on again, quickly, “It\u0027s not I that should go away, Mary. It\u0027s yourself. You hate the place—it\u0027s terrible for you to have to live here. Have you never thought of going away?” She did not answer at once, and when she did the excitement was gone from her voice; it was flat and dull with despair. “\u0027Tis no use to think of me. There\u0027s nothin\u0027 I can do—there\u0027s nothin\u0027 any girl can do when she\u0027s poor. I\u0027ve tried—but \u0027tis like bein\u0027 up against a stone wall. I can\u0027t even save the money to get on a train with! I\u0027ve tried it—I been savin\u0027 for two years—and how much d\u0027ye think I got, Joe? Seven dollars! Seven dollars in two years! No—ye can\u0027t save money in a place where there\u0027s so many things that wring the heart. Ye may hate them for being cowards—but ye must help when ye see a man killed, and his family turned out without a roof to cover them in the winter-time!” “You\u0027re too tender-hearted, Mary.” “No, \u0027tis not that! Should I go off and leave me own brother and sister, that need me?” “But you could earn money and send it to them.” “I earn a little here—I do cleanin\u0027 and nursin\u0027 for some that need me.” “But outside—couldn\u0027t you earn more?” “I could get a job in a restaurant for seven or eight a week, but I\u0027d have to spend more, and what I sent home would not go so far, with me away. Or I could get a job in some other woman\u0027s home, and work fourteen hours a day for it. But, Joe, \u0027tis not more drudgery I want, \u0027tis somethin\u0027 fair to look upon—somethin\u0027 of my own!” She flung out her arms suddenly like one being stifled. “Oh, I want somethin\u0027 that\u0027s fair and clean!” Again he felt her trembling. Again the path was rough, and having an impulse of sympathy, he put his arm about her. In the world of leisure, one might indulge in such considerateness, and he assumed it would not be different with a miner\u0027s daughter. But then, when she was close to him, he felt, rather than heard, a sob. “Mary!” he whispered; and they stopped. Almost without realising it, he put his other arm about her, and in a moment more he felt her warm breath on his cheek, and she was trembling and shaking in his embrace. “Joe! Joe!” she whispered. “You take me away!” She was a rose in a mining-camp, and Hal was deeply moved. The primrose path of dalliance stretched fair before him, here in the soft summer night, with a moon overhead which bore the same message as it bore in the Italian gardens of the leisure-class. But not many minutes passed before a cold fear began to steal over Hal. There was a girl at home, waiting for him; and also there was the resolve which had been growing in him since his coming to this place—a resolve to find some way of compensation to the poor, to repay them for the freedom and culture he had taken; not to prey upon them, upon any individual among them. There were the Jeff Cottons for that! “Mary,” he pleaded, “we mustn\u0027t do this.” “Why not?” “Because—I\u0027m not free. There is some one else.” He felt her start, but she did not draw away. “Where?” she asked, in a low voice. “At home, waiting for me.” “And why didn\u0027t ye tell me?” “I don\u0027t know.” Hal realised in a moment that the girl had ground of complaint against him. According to the simple code of her world, he had gone some distance with her; he had been seen to walk out with her, he had been accounted her “fellow.” He had led her to talk to him of herself—he had insisted upon having her confidences. And these people who were poor did not have subtleties, there was no room in their lives for intellectual curiosities, for Platonic friendships or philanderings. “Forgive me, Mary!” he said. She made no answer; but a sob escaped her, and she drew back from his arms—slowly. He struggled with an impulse to clasp her again. She was beautiful, warm with life—and so much in need of happiness! But he held himself in check, and for a minute or two they stood apart. Then he asked, humbly, “We can still be friends, Mary, can\u0027t we? You must know—I\u0027m so sorry!” But she could not endure being pitied. “\u0027Tis nothin\u0027,” she said. “Only I thought I was going to get away! That\u0027s what ye mean to me.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3238/88707.html","bookId":649,"book":{"id":649,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： Upton Sinclair is one of the not too many writers who have consecrated their lives to the agitation for social justice, and who have also enrolled their art in the service of a set purpose.
