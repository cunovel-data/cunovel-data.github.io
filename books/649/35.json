{"id":11101,"no":35,"title":"SECTION 5.","content":"This business of conspiracy was grimly real to men whose living came out of coal; but Hal, even at the most serious moments, continued to find in it the thrill of romance. He had read stories of revolutionists, and of the police who hunted them. That such excitements were to be had in Russia, he knew; but if any one had told him they could be had in his own free America, within a few hours\u0027 journey of his home city and his college-town, he could not have credited the statement. The evening after his visit to Edstrom, Hal was stopped on the street by his boss. Encountering him suddenly, Hal started, like a pick-pocket who runs into a policeman. “Hello, kid,” said the pit-boss. “Hello, Mr. Stone,” was the reply. “I want to talk to you,” said the boss. “All right, sir.” And then, under his breath, “He\u0027s got me!” “Come up to my house,” said Stone; and Hal followed, feeling as if hand-cuffs were already on his wrists. “Say,” said the man, as they walked, “I thought you were going to tell me if you\u0027d heard any talk.” “I haven\u0027t heard any, sir.” “Well,” continued Stone, “you want to get busy; there\u0027s sure to be kickers in every coal-camp.” And deep within, Hal drew a sigh of relief. It was a false alarm! They came to the boss\u0027s house, and he took a chair on the piazza and motioned Hal to take another. They sat in semi-darkness, and Stone dropped his voice as he began. “What I want to talk to you about now is something else—this election.” “Election, sir?” “Didn\u0027t you know there was one? The Congressman in this district died, and there\u0027s a special election three weeks from next Tuesday.” “I see, sir.” And Hal chuckled inwardly. He would get the information which Tom Olson had recommended to him! “You ain\u0027t heard any talk about it?” inquired the pit-boss. “Nothing at all, sir. I never pay much attention to politics—it ain\u0027t in my line.” “Well, that\u0027s the way I like to hear a miner talk!” said the pit-boss, with heartiness. “If they all had sense enough to leave politics to the politicians, they\u0027d be a sight better off. What they need is to tend to their own jobs.” “Yes, sir,” agreed Hal, meekly—“like I had to tend to them mules, if I didn\u0027t want to get the colic.” The boss smiled appreciatively. “You\u0027ve got more sense than most of \u0027em. If you\u0027ll stand by me, there\u0027ll be a chance for you to move up in the world.” “Thank you, Mr. Stone,” said Hal. “Give me a chance.” “Well now, here\u0027s this election. Every year they send us a bunch of campaign money to handle. A bit of it might come your way.” “I could use it, I reckon,” said Hal, brightening visibly. “What is it you want?” There was a pause, while Stone puffed on his pipe. He went on, in a business-like manner. “What I want is somebody to feel things out a bit, and let me know the situation. I thought it better not to use the men that generally work for me, but somebody that wouldn\u0027t be suspected. Down in Sheridan and Pedro they say the Democrats are making a big stir, and the company\u0027s worried. I suppose you know the \u0027G. F. C.\u0027 is Republican.” “I\u0027ve heard so.” “You might think a congressman don\u0027t have much to do with us, way off in Washington; but it has a bad effect to have him campaigning, telling the men the company\u0027s abusing them. So I\u0027d like you just to kind o\u0027 circulate a bit, and start the men on politics, and see if any of them have been listening to this MacDougall talk. (MacDougall\u0027s this here Democrat, you know.) And I want to find out whether they\u0027ve been sending in literature to this camp, or have any agents here. You see, they claim the right to come in and make speeches, and all that sort of thing. North Valley\u0027s an incorporated town, so they\u0027ve got the law on their side, in a way, and if we shut \u0027em out, they make a howl in the papers, and it looks bad. So we have to get ahead of them in quiet ways. Fortunately there ain\u0027t any hall in the camp for them to meet in, and we\u0027ve made a local ordinance against meetings on the street. If they try to bring in circulars, something has to happen to them before they get distributed. See?” “I see,” said Hal; he thought of Tom Olson\u0027s propaganda literature! “We\u0027ll pass the word out,—it\u0027s the Republican the company wants elected; and you be on the lookout and see how they take it in the camp.” “That sounds easy enough,” said Hal. “But tell me, Mr. Stone, why do you bother? Do so many of these wops have votes?” “It ain\u0027t the wops so much. We get them naturalised on purpose—they vote our way for a glass of beer. But the English-speaking men, or the foreigners that\u0027s been here too long, and got too big for their breeches—they\u0027re the ones we got to watch. If they get to talking politics, they don\u0027t stop there; the first thing you know, they\u0027re listening to union agitators, and wanting to run the camp.” “Oh yes, I see!” said Hal, and wondered if his voice sounded right. But the pit-boss was concerned with his own troubles. “As I told Si Adams the other day, what I\u0027m looking for is fellows that talk some new lingo—one that nobody will ever understand! But I suppose that would be too easy. There\u0027s no way to keep them from learning some English!” Hal decided to make use of this opportunity to perfect his education. “Surely, Mr. Stone,” he remarked, “you don\u0027t have to count any votes if you don\u0027t want to!” “Well, I\u0027ll tell you,” replied Stone; “it\u0027s a question of the easiest way to manage things. When I was superintendent over to Happy Gulch, we didn\u0027t waste no time on politics. The company was Democratic at that time, and when election night come, we wrote down four hundred votes for the Democratic candidates. But the first thing we knew, a bunch of fellers was taken into town and got to swear they\u0027d voted the Republican ticket in our camp. The Republican papers were full of it, and some fool judge ordered a recount, and we had to get busy over night and mark up a new lot of ballots. It gave us a lot of bother!” The pit-boss laughed, and Hal joined him discreetly. “So you see, you have to learn to manage. If there\u0027s votes for the wrong candidate in your camp, the fact gets out, and if the returns is too one-sided, there\u0027s a lot of grumbling. There\u0027s plenty of bosses that don\u0027t care, but I learned my lesson that time, and I got my own method—that is not to let any opposition start. See?” “Yes, I see.” “Maybe a mine-boss has got no right to meddle in politics—but there\u0027s one thing he\u0027s got the say about, and that is who works in his mine. It\u0027s the easiest thing to weed out—weed out—” Hal never forgot the motion of beefy hands with which Alec Stone illustrated these words. As he went on, the tones of his voice did not seem so good-natured as usual. “The fellows that don\u0027t want to vote my way can go somewhere else to do their voting. That\u0027s all I got to say on politics!” There was a brief pause, while Stone puffed on his pipe. Then it may have occurred to him that it was not necessary to go into so much detail in breaking in a political recruit. When he resumed, it was in a good-natured tone of dismissal. “That\u0027s what you do, kid. To-morrow you get a sprained wrist, so you can\u0027t work for a few days, and that\u0027ll give you a chance to bum round and hear what the men are saying. Meantime, I\u0027ll see you get your wages.” “That sounds all right,” said Hal; but showing only a small part of his satisfaction! The pit-boss rose from his chair and knocked the ashes from his pipe. “Mind you—I want the goods. I\u0027ve got other fellows working, and I\u0027m comparing \u0027em. For all you know, I may have somebody watching you.” “Yes,” said Hal, and grinned cheerfully. “I\u0027ll not fail to bear that in mind.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3238/88717.html","bookId":649,"book":{"id":649,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： Upton Sinclair is one of the not too many writers who have consecrated their lives to the agitation for social justice, and who have also enrolled their art in the service of a set purpose.
