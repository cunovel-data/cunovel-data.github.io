{"id":11116,"no":50,"title":"SECTION 19.","content":"Hal took a minute or so to ponder the situation. “Mr. Cotton,” he said, at last. “I know how to spell better than that. Also my handwriting is a bit more fluent.” There was a trace of a smile about the marshal\u0027s cruel lips. “I know,” he replied. “I\u0027ve not failed to compare them.” “You have a good secret-service department!” said Hal. “Before you get through, young fellow, you\u0027ll discover that our legal department is equally efficient.” “Well,” said Hal, “they\u0027ll need to be; for I don\u0027t see how you can get round the fact that I\u0027m a check-weighman, chosen according to the law, and with a group of the men behind me.” “If that\u0027s what you\u0027re counting on,” retorted Cotton, “you may as well forget it. You\u0027ve got no group any more.” “Oh! You\u0027ve got rid of them?” “We\u0027ve got rid of the ring-leaders.” “Of whom?” “That old billy-goat, Sikoria, for one.” “You\u0027ve shipped him?” “We have.” “I saw the beginning of that. Where have you sent him?” “That,” smiled the marshal, “is a job for your secret-service department!” “And who else?” “John Edstrom has gone down to bury his wife. It\u0027s not the first time that dough-faced old preacher has made trouble for us, but it\u0027ll be the last. You\u0027ll find him in Pedro—probably in the poor-house.” “No,” responded Hal, quickly—and there came just a touch of elation in his voice—“he won\u0027t have to go to the poor-house at once. You see, I\u0027ve just sent twenty-five dollars to him.” The camp-marshal frowned. “Really!” Then, after a pause, “You did have that money on you! I thought that lousy Greek had got away with it!” “No. Your knave was honest. But so was I. I knew Edstrom had been getting short weight for years, so he was the one person with any right to the money.” This story was untrue, of course; the money was still buried in Edstrom\u0027s cabin. But Hal meant for the old miner to have it in the end, and meantime he wanted to throw Cotton off the track. “A clever trick, young man!” said the marshal. “But you\u0027ll repent it before you\u0027re through. It only makes me more determined to put you where you can\u0027t do us any harm.” “You mean in the pen? You understand, of course, it will mean a jury trial. You can get a jury to do what you want?” “They tell me you\u0027ve been taking an interest in politics in Pedro County. Haven\u0027t you looked into our jury-system?” “No, I haven\u0027t got that far.” The marshal began blowing rings of smoke again. “Well, there are some three hundred men on our jury-list, and we know them all. You\u0027ll find yourself facing a box with Jake Predovich as foreman, three company-clerks, two of Alf Raymond\u0027s saloon-keepers, a ranchman with a mortgage held by the company-bank, and five Mexicans who have no idea what it\u0027s all about, but would stick a knife into your back for a drink of whiskey. The District Attorney is a politician who favours the miners in his speeches, and favours us in his acts; while Judge Denton, of the district court, is the law partner of Vagleman, our chief-counsel. Do you get all that?” “Yes,” said Hal. “I\u0027ve heard of the \u0027Empire of Raymond\u0027; I\u0027m interested to see the machinery. You\u0027re quite open about it!” “Well,” replied the marshal, “I want you to know what you\u0027re up against. We didn\u0027t start this fight, and we\u0027re perfectly willing to end it without trouble. All we ask is that you make amends for the mischief you\u0027ve done us.” “By \u0027making amends,\u0027 you mean I\u0027m to disgrace myself—to tell the men I\u0027m a traitor?” “Precisely,” said the marshal. “I think I\u0027ll have a seat while I consider the matter,” said Hal; and he took a chair, and stretched out his legs, and made himself elaborately comfortable. “That bench upstairs is frightfully hard,” said he, and smiled mockingly upon the camp-marshal. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3238/88732.html","bookId":649,"book":{"id":649,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： Upton Sinclair is one of the not too many writers who have consecrated their lives to the agitation for social justice, and who have also enrolled their art in the service of a set purpose.
