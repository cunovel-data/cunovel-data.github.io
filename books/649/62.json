{"id":11128,"no":62,"title":"SECTION 31.","content":"Mary forced herself to go on. “This is how I\u0027ve worked it out, Joe! I said to meself, \u0027Ye love this man; and it\u0027s his love ye want—nothin\u0027 else! If he\u0027s got a place in the world, ye\u0027d only hold him back—and ye\u0027d not want to do that. Ye don\u0027t want his name, or his friends, or any of those things—ye want him!\u0027 Have ye ever heard of such a thing as that?” Her cheeks were flaming, but she continued to meet his gaze. “Yes, I\u0027ve heard of it,” he answered, in a low voice. “What would ye say to it? Is it honest? The Reverend Spragg would say \u0027twas the devil, no doubt; Father O\u0027Gorman, down in Pedro, would call it mortal sin; and maybe they know—but I don\u0027t! I only know I can\u0027t stand it any more!” Tears sprang to her eyes, and she cried out suddenly, “Oh, take me away from here! Take me away and give me a chance, Joe! I\u0027ll ask nothing, I\u0027ll never stand in your way; I\u0027ll work for ye, I\u0027ll cook and wash and do everything for ye, I\u0027ll wear my fingers to the bone! Or I\u0027ll go out and work at some job, and earn my share. And I\u0027ll make ye this promise—if ever ye get tired and want to leave me, ye\u0027ll not hear a word of complaint!” She made no conscious appeal to his senses; she sat gazing at him honestly through her tears, and that made it all the harder to answer her. What could he say? He felt the old dangerous impulse—to take the girl in his arms and comfort her. When finally he spoke it was with an effort to keep his voice calm. “I\u0027d say yes, Mary, if I thought it would work.” “It would work! It would, Joe! Ye can quit when ye want to. I mean it!” “There\u0027s no woman lives who can be happy on such terms, Mary. She wants her man, and she wants him to herself, and she wants him always; she\u0027s only deluding herself if she believes anything else. You\u0027re over-wrought now, what you\u0027ve seen in the last few days has made you wild—” “No!” she exclaimed. “\u0027Tis not only that! I been thinkin\u0027 about it for weeks.” “I know. You\u0027ve been thinking, but you wouldn\u0027t have spoken if it hadn\u0027t been for this horror.” He paused for a moment, to renew his own self-possession. “It won\u0027t do, Mary,” he declared. “I\u0027ve seen it tried more than once, and I\u0027m not so old either. My own brother tried it once, and ruined himself.” “Ah, ye\u0027re afraid to trust me, Joe!” “No, it\u0027s not that; what I mean is—he ruined his own heart, he made himself selfish. He took everything, and gave nothing. He\u0027s much older than I, so I\u0027ve had a chance to see its effect on him. He\u0027s cold, he has no faith, even in his own nature; when you talk to him about making the world better he tells you you\u0027re a fool.” “It\u0027s another way of bein\u0027 afraid of me,” she insisted. “Afraid you\u0027d ought to marry me!” “But, Mary—there\u0027s the other girl. I really love her, and I\u0027m promised to her. What can I do?” “\u0027Tis that I\u0027ve never believed you loved her,” she said, in a whisper. Her eyes fell and she began picking nervously again at the faded blue dress, which was smutted and grease-stained, perhaps from her recent effort with Mrs. Zamboni\u0027s brood. Several times Hal thought she was going to speak, but she shut her lips tightly again; he watched her, his heart aching. When finally she spoke, it was still in a whisper, and there was a note of humility he had never heard from her before. “Ye\u0027ll not be wantin\u0027 to speak to me, Joe, after what I\u0027ve said.” “Oh, Mary!” he exclaimed, and caught her hand, “don\u0027t say I\u0027ve made you more unhappy! I want to help you! Won\u0027t you let me be your friend—your real, true friend? Let me help you to get out of this trap; you\u0027ll have a chance to look about, you\u0027ll find a way to be happy—the whole world will seem different to you then, and you\u0027ll laugh at the idea that you ever wanted me!” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3238/88744.html","bookId":649,"book":{"id":649,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： Upton Sinclair is one of the not too many writers who have consecrated their lives to the agitation for social justice, and who have also enrolled their art in the service of a set purpose.
