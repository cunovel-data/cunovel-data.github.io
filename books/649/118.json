{"id":11184,"no":118,"title":"SECTION 29.","content":"Mary\u0027s voice had dropped low, and Hal thought how rich and warm it was when she was deeply moved. She went on: “I lived all me life in minin\u0027 camps, Joe Smith, and I seen men robbed and beaten, and women cryin\u0027 and childer hungry. I seen the company, like some great wicked beast that eat them up. But I never knew why, or what it meant—till that day, there at the Minettis\u0027. I\u0027d read about fine ladies in books, ye see; but I\u0027d never been spoke to by one, I\u0027d never had to swallow one, as ye might say. But there I did—and all at once I seemed to know where the money goes that\u0027s wrung out of the miners. I saw why people were robbin\u0027 us, grindin\u0027 the life out of us—for fine ladies like that, to keep them so shinin\u0027 and soft! \u0027Twould not have been so bad, if she\u0027d not come just then, with all the men and boys dyin\u0027 down in the pits—dyin\u0027 for that soft, white skin, and those soft, white hands, and all those silky things she swished round in. My God, Joe—d\u0027ye know what she seemed to me like? Like a smooth, sleek cat that has just eat up a whole nest full of baby mice, and has the blood of them all over her cheeks!” Mary paused, breathing hard. Hal kept silence, and she went on again: “I had it out with meself, Joe! I don\u0027t want ye to think I\u0027m any better than I am, and I asked meself this question—Is it for the men in the pits that ye hate her with such black murder? Or is it for the one man ye want, and that she\u0027s got? And I knew the answer to that! But then I asked meself another question, too—Would ye be like her if ye could? Would ye do what she\u0027s doin\u0027 right now—would ye have it on your soul? And as God hears me, Joe, \u0027tis the truth I speak—I\u0027d not do it! No, not for the love of any man that ever walked on this earth!” She had lifted her clenched fist as she spoke. She let it fall again, and strode on, not even glancing at him. “Ye might try a thousand years, Joe, and ye\u0027d not realise the feelin\u0027s that come to me there at the Minettis\u0027. The shame of it—not what she done to me, but what she made me in me own eyes! Me, the daughter of a drunken old miner, and her—I don\u0027t know what her father is, but she\u0027s some sort of princess, and she knows it. And that\u0027s the thing that counts, Joe! \u0027Tis not that she has so much money, and so many fine things; that she knows how to talk, and I don\u0027t, and that her voice is sweet, and mine is ugly, when I\u0027m ragin\u0027 as I am now. No—\u0027tis that she\u0027s so sure! That\u0027s the word I found to say it; she\u0027s sure—sure—sure! She has the fine things, she\u0027s always had them, she has a right to have them! And I have a right to nothin\u0027 but trouble, I\u0027m hunted all day by misery and fear, I\u0027ve lost even the roof over me head! Joe, ye know I\u0027ve got some temper—I\u0027m not easy to beat down; but when I\u0027d got through bein\u0027 taught me place, I went off and hid meself, I ground me face in the dirt, for the black rage of it! I said to meself, \u0027Tis true! There\u0027s somethin\u0027 in her better than me! She\u0027s some kind of finer creature.—Look at these hands!” She held them out in the moonlight, with a swift, passionate gesture. “So she\u0027s a right to her man, and I\u0027m a fool to have ever raised me eyes to him! I have to see him go away, and crawl back into me leaky old shack! Yes, that\u0027s the truth! And when I point it out to the man, what d\u0027ye think he says? Why, he tells me gently and kindly that I ought to be sorry for her! Christ! did ye ever hear the like of that?” There was a long silence. Hal could not have said anything now, if he had wished to. He knew that this was what he had come to seek! This was the naked soul of the class-war! “Now,” concluded Mary, with clenched hands, and a voice that corresponded, “now, I\u0027ve had it out. I\u0027m no slave; I\u0027ve just as good a right to life as any lady. I know I\u0027ll never have it, of course; I\u0027ll never wear good clothes, nor live in a decent home, nor have the man I want; but I\u0027ll know that I\u0027ve done somethin\u0027 to help free the workin\u0027 people from the shame that\u0027s put on them. That\u0027s what the strike done for me, Joe! The strike showed me the way. We\u0027re beat this time, but somehow it hasn\u0027t made the difference ye might think. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to make more strikes before I quit, and they won\u0027t all of them be beat!” She stopped speaking; and Hal walked beside her, stirred by a conflict of emotions. His vision of her was indeed true; she would make more strikes! He was glad and proud of that; but then came the thought that while she, a girl, was going on with the bitter war, he, a man, would be eating grilled beefsteaks at the club! “Mary,” he said, “I\u0027m ashamed of myself—” “That\u0027s not it, Joe! Ye\u0027ve no call to be ashamed. Ye can\u0027t help it where ye were born—” “Perhaps not, Mary. But when a man knows he\u0027s never paid for any of the things he\u0027s enjoyed all his life, surely the least he can do is to be ashamed. I hope you\u0027ll try not to hate me as you do the others.” “I never hated ye, Joe! Not for one moment! I tell ye fair and true, I love ye as much as ever. I can say it, because I\u0027d not have ye now; I\u0027ve seen the other girl, and I know ye\u0027d never be satisfied with me. I don\u0027t know if I ought to say it, but I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 ye\u0027ll not be altogether satisfied with her, either. Ye\u0027ll be unhappy either way—God help ye!” The girl had read deeply into his soul in this last speech; so deeply that Hal could not trust himself to answer. They were passing a street-lamp, and she looked at him, for the first time since they had started on their walk, and saw harassment in his face. A sudden tenderness came into her voice. “Joe,” she said; “ye\u0027re lookin\u0027 bad. \u0027Tis good ye\u0027re goin\u0027 away from this place!” He tried to smile, but the effort was feeble. “Joe,” she went on, “ye asked me to be your friend. Well, I\u0027ll be that!” And she held out the big, rough hand. He took it. “We\u0027ll not forget each other, Mary,” he said. There was a catch in his voice. “Sure, lad!” she exclaimed. “We\u0027ll make another strike some day, just like we did at North Valley!” Hal pressed the big hand; but then suddenly, remembering his brother stalking solemnly in the rear, he relinquished the clasp, and failed to say all the fine things he had in his mind. He called himself a rebel, but not enough to be sentimental before Edward!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3238/88800.html","bookId":649,"book":{"id":649,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： Upton Sinclair is one of the not too many writers who have consecrated their lives to the agitation for social justice, and who have also enrolled their art in the service of a set purpose.
