{"id":11183,"no":117,"title":"SECTION 28.","content":"Hal wanted a chance to talk to Mary Burke; they had had no intimate talk since the meeting with Jessie Arthur, and now he was going away, for a long time. He wanted to find out what plans Mary had for the future, and—more important yet—what was her state of mind. If he had been able to lift this girl from despair, his summer course in practical sociology had not been all a failure! He asked her to go with him to say good-bye to John Edstrom, whom he had not seen since their unceremonious parting at MacKellar\u0027s, when Hal had fled to Percy Harrigan\u0027s train. Downstairs in the lobby Hal explained his errand to his waiting brother, who made no comment, but merely remarked that he would follow, if Hal had no objection. He did not care to make the acquaintance of the Hibernian Joan of Arc, and would not come close enough to interfere with Hal\u0027s conversation with the lady; but he wished to do what he could for his brother\u0027s protection. So there set out a moon-light procession—first Hal and Mary, then Edward, and then Edward\u0027s dinner-table companion, the “hardware-drummer!” Hal was embarrassed in beginning his farewell talk with Mary. He had no idea how she felt towards him, and he admitted with a guilty pang that he was a little afraid to find out! He thought it best to be cheerful, so he started to tell her how fine he thought her conduct during the strike. But she did not respond to his remarks, and at last he realised that she was labouring with some thoughts of her own. “There\u0027s somethin\u0027 I got to say to ye!” she began, suddenly. “A couple of days ago I knew how I meant to say it, but now I don\u0027t.” “Well,” he laughed, “say it as you meant to.” “No; \u0027twas bitter—and now I\u0027m on my knees before ye.” “Not that I want you to be bitter,” said Hal, still laughing, “but it\u0027s I that ought to be on my knees before you. I didn\u0027t accomplish anything, you know.” “Ye did all ye could—and more than the rest of us. I want ye to know I\u0027ll never forget it. But I want ye to hear the other thing, too!” She walked on, staring before her, doubling up her hands in agitation. “Well?” said he, still trying to keep a cheerful tone. “Ye remember that day just after the explosion? Ye remember what I said about—about goin\u0027 away with ye? I take it back.” “Oh, of course!” said he, quickly. “You were distracted, Mary—you didn\u0027t know what you were saying.” “No, no! That\u0027s not it! But I\u0027ve changed my mind; I don\u0027t mean to throw meself away.” “I told you you\u0027d see it that way,” he said. “No man is worth it.” “Ah, lad!” said she. “\u0027Tis the fine soothin\u0027 tongue ye have—but I\u0027d rather ye knew the truth. \u0027Tis that I\u0027ve seen the other girl; and I hate her!” They walked for a bit in silence. Hal had sense enough to realise that here was a difficult subject. “I don\u0027t want to be a prig, Mary,” he said gently; “but you\u0027ll change your mind about that, too. You\u0027ll not hate her; you\u0027ll be sorry for her.” She laughed—a raw, harsh laugh. “What kind of a joke is that?” “I know—it may seem like one. But it\u0027ll come to you some day. You have a wonderful thing to live and fight for; while she”—he hesitated a moment, for he was not sure of his own ideas on this subject—“she has so many things to learn; and she may never learn them. She\u0027ll miss some fine things.” “I know one of the fine things she does not mean to miss,” said Mary, grimly; “that\u0027s Mr. Hal Warner.” Then, after they had walked again in silence: “I want ye to understand me, Mr. Warner—” “Ah, Mary!” he pleaded. “Don\u0027t treat me that way! I\u0027m Joe.” “All right,” she said, “Joe ye shall be. \u0027Twill remind ye of a pretty adventure—bein\u0027 a workin\u0027 man for a few weeks. Well, that\u0027s a part of what I have to tell ye. I\u0027ve got my pride, even if I\u0027m only a poor miner\u0027s daughter; and the other day I found out me place.” “How do you mean?” he asked. “Ye don\u0027t understand? Honest?” “No, honest,” he said. “Ye\u0027re stupid with women, Joe. Ye didn\u0027t see what the girl did to me! \u0027Twas some kind of a bug I was to her. She was not sure if I was the kind that bites, but she took no chances—she threw me off, like that.” And Mary snapped her hand, as one does when troubled with a bug. “Ah, now!” pleaded Hal. “You\u0027re not being fair!” “I\u0027m bein\u0027 just as fair as I\u0027ve got it in me to be, Joe. I been off and had it all out. I can see this much—\u0027tis not her fault, maybe—\u0027tis her class; \u0027tis all of ye—the very best of ye, even yeself, Joe Smith!” “Yea,” he replied, “Tim Rafferty said that.” “Tim said too much—but a part of it was true. Ye think ye\u0027ve come here and been one of us workin\u0027 people. But don\u0027t your own sense tell you the difference, as if it was a canyon a million miles across—between a poor ignorant creature in a minin\u0027 camp, and a rich man\u0027s daughter, a lady? Ye\u0027d tell me not to be ashamed of poverty; but would ye ever put me by the side of her—for all your fine feelin\u0027s of friendship for them that\u0027s beneath ye? Didn\u0027t ye show that at the Minettis\u0027?” “But don\u0027t you see, Mary—” He made an effort to laugh. “I got used to obeying Jessie! I knew her a long time before I knew you.” “Ah, Joe! Ye\u0027ve a kind heart, and a pleasant way of speakin\u0027. But wouldn\u0027t it interest ye to know the real truth? Ye said ye\u0027d come out here to learn the truth!” And Hal answered, in a low voice, “Yes,” and did not interrupt again.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3238/88799.html","bookId":649,"book":{"id":649,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： Upton Sinclair is one of the not too many writers who have consecrated their lives to the agitation for social justice, and who have also enrolled their art in the service of a set purpose.
