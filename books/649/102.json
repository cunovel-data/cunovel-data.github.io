{"id":11168,"no":102,"title":"SECTION 12.","content":"Hal sat staring in front of him, silent. Was it a fact that every man had something in his life which palsied his arm, and struck him helpless in the battle for social justice? When he spoke again, it was in a low voice. “Edward, I\u0027m thinking about a young Irish boy who works in these mines. He, too, has a father; and this father was caught in the explosion. He\u0027s an old man, with a wife and seven other children. He\u0027s a good man, the boy\u0027s a good boy. Let me tell you what Peter Harrigan has done to them!” “Well,” said Edward, “whatever it is, it\u0027s all right, you can help them. They won\u0027t need to starve.” “I know,” said Hal, “but there are so many others; I can\u0027t help them all. And besides, can\u0027t you see, Edward—what I\u0027m thinking about is not charity, but justice. I\u0027m sure this boy, Tim Rafferty, loves his father just exactly as much as I love my father; and there are other old men here, with sons who love them—” “Oh, Hal, for Christ\u0027s sake!” exclaimed Edward, in a sort of explosion. He had no other words to express his impatience. “Do you expect to take all the troubles in the world on your shoulders?” And he sprang up and caught the other by the arm. “Boy, you\u0027ve got to come away from here!” Hal got up, without answering. He seemed irresolute, and his brother started to draw him towards the door. “I\u0027ve got a car here. We can get a train in an hour—” Hal saw that he had to speak firmly. “No, Edward,” he said. “I can\u0027t come just yet.” “I tell you you must come!” “I can\u0027t. I made these men a promise!” “In God\u0027s name—what are these men to you? Compared with your own father!” “I can\u0027t explain it, Edward. I\u0027ve talked for half an hour, and I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve even heard me. Suffice it to say that I see these people caught in a trap—and one that my whole life has helped to make. I can\u0027t leave them in it. What\u0027s more, I don\u0027t believe Dad would want me to do it, if he understood.” The other made a last effort at self-control. “I\u0027m not going to call you a sentimental fool. Only, let me ask you one plain question. What do you think you can do for these people?” “I think I can help to win decent conditions for them.” “Good God!” cried Edward; he sighed, in his agony of exasperation. “In Peter Harrigan\u0027s mines! Don\u0027t you realise that he\u0027ll pick them up and throw them out of here, neck and crop—the whole crew, every man in the town, if necessary?” “Perhaps,” answered Hal; “but if the men in the other mines should join them—if the big union outside should stand by them—” “You\u0027re dreaming, Hal! You\u0027re talking like a child! I talked to the superintendent here; he had telegraphed the situation to Old Peter, and had just got an answer. Already he\u0027s acted, no doubt.” “Acted?” echoed Hal. “How do you mean?” He was staring at his brother in sudden anxiety. “They were going to turn the agitators out, of course.” “What? And while I\u0027m here talking!” Hal turned toward the door. “You knew it all the time!” he exclaimed. “You kept me here deliberately!” He was starting away, but Edward sprang and caught him. “What could you have done?” “Turn me loose!” cried Hal, angrily. “Don\u0027t be a fool, Hal! I\u0027ve been trying to keep you out of the trouble. There may be fighting.” Edward threw himself between Hal and the door, and there was a sharp struggle. But the elder man was no longer the athlete, the young bronzed god; he had been sitting at a desk in an office, while Hal had been doing hard labour. Hal threw him to one side, and in a moment more had sprung out of the door, and was running down the slope. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3238/88784.html","bookId":649,"book":{"id":649,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： Upton Sinclair is one of the not too many writers who have consecrated their lives to the agitation for social justice, and who have also enrolled their art in the service of a set purpose.
