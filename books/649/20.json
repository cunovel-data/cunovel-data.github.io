What\u0027s the good of throwin\u0027 away your job?” He lowered his voice. “Would you seriously like to have a union here?” “Seriously?” said she. “Didn\u0027t ye see Mr. Rafferty—what a coward he is? That\u0027s the way they are! No, \u0027twas just a burst of my temper. I\u0027m a bit crazy to-night—something happened to set me off.” He thought she was going on, but apparently she changed her mind. Finally he asked, “What happened?” “Oh, \u0027twould do no good to talk,” she answered; and they walked a bit farther in silence. “Tell me about it, won\u0027t you?” he said; and the kindness in his tone made its impression. “\u0027Tis not much ye know of a coal-camp, Joe Smith,” she said. “Can\u0027t ye imagine what it\u0027s like—bein\u0027 a woman in a place like this? And a woman they think good-lookin\u0027!” “Oh, so it\u0027s that!” said he, and was silent again. “Some one\u0027s been troubling you?” he ventured after a while. “Sure! Some one\u0027s always troublin\u0027 us women! Always! Never a day but we hear it. Winks and nudges—everywhere ye turn.” “Who is it?” “The bosses, the clerks—anybody that has a chance to wear a stiff collar, and thinks he can offer money to a girl. It begins before she\u0027s out of short skirts, and there\u0027s never any peace afterwards.” “And you can\u0027t make them understand?” “I\u0027ve made them understand me a bit; now they go after my old man.” “What?” “Sure! D\u0027ye suppose they\u0027d not try that? Him that\u0027s so crazy for liquor, and can never get enough of it!” “And your father?—” But Hal stopped. She would not want that question asked! She had seen his hesitation, however. “He was a decent man once,” she declared. “\u0027Tis the life here, that turns a man into a coward. \u0027Tis everything ye need, everywhere ye turn—ye have to ask favours from some boss. The room ye work in, the dead work they pile on ye; or maybe \u0027tis more credit ye need at the store, or maybe the doctor to come when ye\u0027re sick. Just now \u0027tis our roof that leaks—so bad we can\u0027t find a dry place to sleep when it rains.” “I see,” said Hal. “Who owns the house?” “Sure, there\u0027s none but company houses here.” “Who\u0027s supposed to fix it?” “Mr. Kosegi, the house-agent. But we gave him up long ago—if he does anything, he raises the rent. Today my father went to Mr. Cotton. He\u0027s supposed to look out for the health of the place, and it seems hardly healthy to keep people wet in their beds.” “And what did Cotton say?” asked Hal, when she stopped again. “Well, don\u0027t ye know Jeff Cotton—can\u0027t ye guess what he\u0027d say? \u0027That\u0027s a fine girl ye got, Burke! Why don\u0027t ye make her listen to reason?\u0027 And then he laughed, and told me old father he\u0027d better learn to take a hint. \u0027Twas bad for an old man to sleep in the rain—he might get carried off by pneumonia.” Hal could no longer keep back the question, “What did your father do?” “I\u0027d not have ye think hard of my old father,” she said, quickly. “He used to be a fightin\u0027 man, in the days before O\u0027Callahan had his way with him. But now he knows what a camp-marshal can do to a miner!” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3238/88702.html","bookId":649,"book":{"id":649,"title":"King Coal","description":"简介： Upton Sinclair is one of the not too many writers who have consecrated their lives to the agitation for social justice, and who have also enrolled their art in the service of a set purpose.
