{"id":95405,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Epilogue: The exact provenance of the word Kentucky is a matter of dispute. The popular translation used by Civil War historians that the word means \"dark and bloody ground\" is almost certainly false.\\n\\n For purposes of this history of Vampire Earth, it may be most appropriate to use the alleged Iroquoi-Wyandot phrase \"land of tomorrow.\" What began to take shape at what Lambert called the heart of North America\u0027s great rivers as summer came on hot and dry and lush, was the first sprout of the new world that would have to take shape, should the Kurians be overthrown.\\n\\n Man and Grog, ratbit and Reaper, horse and legworm, radio and newspaper, clattering petro-fueled engine and brown-water-churning propeller, community and its defenders came together that spring in something the world hadn\u0027t seen before, at least at the scale envisioned by Brother Mark. Like the ingredients in a stew, each took on some flavor from the other after the heat of action.\\n\\n Kentucky would see more violence. Atlanta wouldn\u0027t give up their plans for the conquest and incorporation easily. Kentucky lived up to its misnomer as a dark and bloody ground in the following years, but like a vigorous new hybrid, its thrived in the churned-up soil.\\n\\n After false starts in the swamps of Arkansas, the plains of Central Asia, the shores of Lake Victoria in Africa, and the islands and coasts of Japan and Alaska, the seeds of the future at last fell on fertile ground in Kentucky. Fate and the necessities of duty would soon separate some of the actors who gave what would become the Great Rivers Freehold its vigorous birth from their newborn republic.\\n\\n But most would return, in time.\\n\\n For now, we shall return briefly to the last few steps of a series of weary marches and passages by our no-longer-so-young major.\\n\\n David Stuart Valentine felt each of his thirty years as he walked back up from the river landing to Fort Seng. His leg and back hurt. An old pain, one he hadn\u0027t had since a Reaper nearly took his head off during the escape from Xanadu, throbbed at his jawline.\\n\\n Even echoes of the stomping he\u0027d taken in a jail cell in Haiti courtesy of Boul brought a dull ache to his ribs.\\n\\n Fort Seng buzzed as he crossed the old highway on its west border, at the edge of the thick woods on that side. The Kurian Missionary\u0027s doughnut stand had been turned upside down, looking like an odd mushroom with its tacked-together wood-pallet foundation.\\n\\n He smelled cordite and shell everywhere. Clearly, there\u0027d been some kind of action.\\n\\n The fragrant smell of dough in hot fat set his saliva running.\\n\\n \"Kur bless you, Major,\" the missionary said.\\n\\n Fort Seng looked like a whirlwind had hit it. It was the air raid all over again, redoubled. Headquarters was more or less intact, but looked scorched with several windows blown out and a hole in the roof.\\n\\n The road to the fort was lined with cheering Bears and a healthy smattering of Wolves, drawn up in neater company lines. Valentine had never seen so many Hunters gathered in one place before.\\n\\n The barbecue pits were ringed by furry lumps of hair, muscle, and weapons clothed in the ragged mix of Reaper cloth, Kevlar, leather, chain, and pig iron that passed for Bear duty uniforms-rumor had it that the entire Bear regiment had only three A uniforms, cleaned, swapped and returned as needed like a rental tux.\\n\\n A rough count numbered them in the hundreds.\\n\\n \"Stevens, acting captain, Company A, First Bear regiment,\" a bearded little man said, stepping forward with a rather abashed and bootless Major Grace behind. \"Only why it\u0027s called the first when there\u0027s only one nobody ever told me, Major. Elements of Companies C and D. Bravo\u0027s still down around Houston. Them Texans said they\u0027d leave the UFR if the Bears got pulled out of the fighting line.\"\\n\\n \"Acting?\"\\n\\n \"Formerly top sergeant,\" Connoly said.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re here without orders?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I got you beat on that, Major. We\u0027re here specifically against orders. Written, verbal, signal flags, smoke signals. I think they tried everything.\"\\n\\n \"Except shooting at us,\" another Bear called.\\n\\n \"Nobody dared.\"\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027re volunteers,\" Valentine said.\\n\\n \"Men who want to fight. Seems like you\u0027re the one piece of Southern Command still in this war to win it. Though when we got here we were a bit surprised to find the place turned over to them Atlanta jaspers. Major Grace here was in the middle of surrendering it to a crew of them. We lit our fires and ran \u0027em off.\"\\n\\n \"Hear tell it, you\u0027re gunning to take on Atlanta,\" a Bear corporal with a strange facial hair pattern-he\u0027d shaved off one eyebrow and half of his pencil mustache on the opposite side-put in. \"We thought we\u0027d get the ball rolling for you.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll be glad to have you at Fort Seng.\"\\n\\n \"Infestations of Quislings is pract\u0027lly our speciality,\" a Bear chimed in. He tightened a hook-studded leather glove.\\n\\n Lambert greeted him in front of the bullet-riddled headquarters, Ediyak at her knees keeping order among the messengers reporting in and asking for instructions. The elegant old mansion had fire damage around two windows and smoke still trickled up from one glassless window frame. Lambert had an interesting dirt pattern about her eyes and smelled of sweat and gunfire. No one could accuse her of being unbloodied in battle ever again.\\n\\n \"Hail the man who opened up the Missouri-Ohio junction,\" Lambert said. \"My map\u0027s looking better and better.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad we have something to come back to, sir.\"\\n\\n He saw Gamecock and a couple of Bears stacking captured weapons and equipment in the parking lot. There were several Pooters and some new light armor vehicles parked there, not much the worse for battle damage. Blood caked on the window of one.\\n\\n \"Atlanta rolled the dice. They almost won, too. Most of the Evansville milita collapsed-there was another air attack, and I don\u0027t think anyone expected them to be able to fight helicopter gun-ships. But half the Lifeweaver-trained hunters of Southern Command showed up at an opportune moment, and nobody objected to attacking without knowing much about the opposition. Luckily it was just recon stuff backed up with garrison troops.\"\\n\\n He could tell she was holding something back.\\n\\n \"Who did we lose?\" Valentine asked, suddenly anxious. \"Where\u0027s Captain Patel?\"\\n\\n \"Patel\u0027s fine, according to his last transmission. He\u0027s handling the pursuit with some Wolves and legworm riders.\"\\n\\n \"Then what?\"\\n\\n \"From the very top, Valentine,\" Lambert said. \"I just received new orders. I guess Major Grace gave us the thumbs down right before he surrendered the joint.\"\\n\\n She handed him the communication tech\u0027s transcription. Block pencil lettering had a date, time, and code confirmation. Below that were the bare words:WITHDRAW TO RALLY BASE. AT ONCE.\\n\\n CONFIRM SOONEST.\\n\\n (S) MARTINEZ, GHQ\\n\\n Valentine didn\u0027t know whether to retch, faint, or shoot himself. Gamecock, up to show him a vintage combat shotgun, steadied him with an arm. \"After all this? The river\u0027s open now. Between the Goliath and the boats, we can hold the river, now.\"\\n\\n \"Not \u0027defensive stance\u0027 enough,\" Duvalier said, appearing from nowhere, in her usual style.\\n\\n \"What about the Golden Ones?\" Valentine asked. \"We\u0027ll just abandon them here?\"\\n\\n \"Must have been garbled. Doesn\u0027t make any sense,\" Lambert said. She turned to her communications staff. \"The equipment must be to blame. Find the fault in our long-range gear. Take it all apart if you have to, and go over it piece by piece. I don\u0027t care if it takes a year to finish the job.\"\\n\\n \"That transmission was confirmed received,\" Valentine said. \"Somebody might call that mutiny. They can shoot you for that.\"\\n\\n \"You seem to be healthy enough with a death sentence,\" Lambert said. \"Operation Javelin\u0027s going to succeed. Maybe it\u0027ll just take a couple tries. But if they want me to stop, they\u0027ll have to drag me out by the heels.\"\\n\\n \"Us by the heels, suh,\" Gamecock said.\\n\\n \"Dots Lambert ignoring orders,\" Valentine marveled.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t withdraw anyway,\" Ediyak put in. \"We\u0027re in action.\"\\n\\n \"And will be the rest of the summer, I expect,\" Lambert said.\\n\\n They watched Fort Seng fill.\\n\\n The Golden Ones filed in, walking in the football-shaped formations of the fighting Grog march. A ratbit rode on broad, faun-colored shoulders here and there. The Gray Baron led his Grogs in, Snake Arms dancing with her reptiles at their head to Bear whistles, the warriors perhaps not as orderly as they\u0027d been at the Gray Stronghold, but time would improve them from war band into soldiers.\\n\\n What fascinating pieces to a yet-unknown future mosaic, Valentine thought. Smelly, disorderly, ragged-like Kentucky, with a full year of warfare washing over it. But toughened and slowly coming together, and unlike the silent, oppressed masses to the south, every one of them could be trusted with a gun and a knife.\\n\\n He almost felt pity for the Kurian Order. He certainly felt it for the poor bastards who\u0027d be sent up against them. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/march-in-country-vampire-earth-9/page-14.html","bookId":2590,"book":{"id":2590,"title":"March in Country (Vampire Earth #9)","description":"Storyline: March in Country (Vampire Earth #9) \\n The race is on to claim the area between the Ohio River and Tennessee.
