You\u0027re assuming that because you never heard of him that there\u0027s nothing to hear.\"\n \"Like you, Georgios.\" The speaker was wearing lightweight leather armor studded with iron.\n \"You\u0027re as bad as Regimus,\" Georgios snapped. \"You and Regimus and Kyrillos and Daidalos and Urien are all the same; just because you\u0027ve been here longest, you think that means you\u0027re the only ones with any knowledge of war and battle.\"\n \"That\u0027s right,\" said the armored man. \"And you\u0027ve yet to show me I\u0027m wrong.\" He indicated Linos. \"Is he any indication of what they\u0027re sending us now?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Belisarius. \"I don\u0027t have a list of men being sent yet. I won\u0027t see it until we join Hyperion.\"\n \"Children,\" scoffed another of the older men—possibly one of those Georgios had named—\"they\u0027re sending us children to lead the soldiers. Is the Emperor trying to win the war with youth instead of force of arms, do you think?\"\n \"Urien,\" Belisarius said sharply, \"it isn\u0027t for us to question the decisions of the Emperor.\"\n \"Does that mean you never doubt the wisdom of what Justinian does?\" asked Urien. \"I never thought you were a fool before, Belisarius, but perhaps I was wrong. If you don\u0027t wonder what Justinian is trying to do, then you are being duped.\"\n Belisarius was standing very straight now and his features were severe. \"That is enough. Every man is entitled to his doubts, but no one is permitted to question what the Emperor does or why he does it. Do you all understand this? I do not want to have another set of replacement officers, but I will not oppose what Justinian commands. Is that clear?\"\n The men said nothing but their expressions were eloquent.\n Linos felt suddenly very awkward, like a man who had walked into a house during an argument. He coughed once and said, \"There are new officers being posted here, of course. Most of you will be sent home or to other garrisons. The Emperor is increasing the number of his troops in Alexandria.\"\n \"Alexandria,\" said one of the men in disgust. \"Egypt! What use is that?\"\n \"The Emperor has decided that there are dangers in Egypt. He believes that there may be attempts to end the strength of Byzantium there.\" Linos spoke with authority now, having spent much of the last month hearing of these things. \"The Emperor wishes to increase the soldiers in Egypt so that those who might be plotting against us will see how foolish they are and desist.\"\n \"It might make them more determined,\" said Belisarius in a distant tone. \"But there is no way to be certain of that until the action has been taken.\"\n \"Does this mean you do not think that the Emperor has been wise?\" Linos was indignant at the suggestion; he glared at Belisarius. \"You are his General. How can you question what he does?\"\n \"I\u0027m not questioning it, and I don\u0027t doubt his decisions. Christos! if I did, I would not continue this campaign under the conditions we have faced; I could not ask it of my men.\" Belisarius looked around him, meeting the eyes of each officer in turn. \"I only wonder, occasionally, how the Emperor\u0027s decisions are seen by others, especially those around him.\"\n One of the officers, a young man with rough bandages covering a large area of festering abrasion, looked directly at Linos with pain-hardened eyes. \"If the Emperor thinks that the officers have been taking advantage of him and have used the war to increase their positions, have him come here himself and see how we fare; share our food and our tents with us.\"\n Belisarius held up his hand to silence this objection. \"I have tried in my reports to make our predicament clear, but we are not the only ones seeking the aid of the Emperor, and he must answer the needs of all his people, not just his army in Italy.\"\n \"And you never doubt him?\" Linos inquired.\n \"Of course; I\u0027ve said so. But the Emperor is the Emperor and he must be the final authority for all of us.\" He indicated the poor condition of his men and the camp. \"If you were here, riding with us, eating with us—\"\n \"When we eat,\" muttered one of the officers but Linos did not know who.\n \"—and living with us, you would have to question what the Emperor commanded us to do. Any sensible man would. But that does not give any of us the right to refuse what the Emperor commands us to do. Is that plain?\" Belisarius was more tired than angry, and his words carried little challenge.\n \"I will see that your sentiments are mentioned in my report,\" Linos promised stiffly.\n \"Oh, for the Grace of Angels!\" Belisarius brought his fist down on a heap of damaged saddlery. \"I am not telling you this for your report. I want you to understand what we are facing here, and why there are problems and discontent, not what you may or may not have to say when you send back your impressions.\"\n The officers moved uneasily and a number of them whispered things to each other without any inclination to include Linos in their observations.\n \"If you have such uncertainty, then perhaps you would recommend another man command in Italy,\" said Linos.\n \"No, I would not.\" His irritation was changing to wrath. \"I have been entrusted with this task and—\"\n \"Yes, entrusted, and you have failed to do what you have been ordered to do,\" Linos said, made bold by the young officers standing around him.\n \"Anyone who thinks that this is deliberate has not been here,\" stated one of the Captains and was seconded by nods and words from the others. \"We have nothing, and we cannot go to war with nothing.\"\n Belisarius stopped the man. \"Never mind, Gnousos. There is no way to explain this to him.\" He turned away abruptly and strode back to his tent.\n \"You might have orders to question the General,\" said Gnousos when Belisarius was out of earshot, \"but you did it as badly as I have ever seen anyone do it. What made you think that you could challenge Belisarius in front of his officers?\"\n \"The Emperor believes that Belisarius is making a force of his own here and that the purpose of these delays is to strengthen himself so that he can march not on Roma but on Constantinople as well and attempt to bring down the government and the Emperor to his own glory and benefit. I am saying this,\" he went on, \"so that any of you who might be aware of such a nefarious plan might clear his conscience by informing me or Captain Hyperion of this and thereby earn not only pardon for yourself but the appreciation of the Emperor for your loyalty.\" He had been worried what reaction this announcement might receive and was pleasantly surprised when two men gave him quick, penetrating looks. Most of the others were hostile.\n \"You would do well to keep such announcements to yourself, youngster,\" said the scarred officer, although he was not much older than Linos. \"Here we do not take well to having the General compromised.\"\n \"All of you?\" Linos asked sharply.\n \"If there are those who disagree, they know better than to speak of it.\"\n This warning struck home. Most of the officers turned away and on one pretext or another left Linos to himself.\n Gnousos asked a question for all of them when he turned back and addressed the messenger in his most casual manner. \"If the Emperor did decide to post another General to Italy, who would it be, do you know?\"\n \"It\u0027s only a rumor,\" hedged Linos.\n \"Who?\"\n \"They say that Narses would be the one to replace Belisarius.\"\n This was met with disbelief and derision. \"Narses? The man\u0027s a eunuch. What does he know about a long campaign like the one we have here? Who suggested Narses?\"\n \"My uncle, among others,\" said Linos stiffly. \"Narses might not have his generative parts but there is nothing wrong with his brain.\"\n \"Narses!\" The officer folded his arms and spat. \"Gnousos, how would you like serving under him?\"\n \"It\u0027s got to be a mistake,\" Gnousos dismissed the notion. \"They might talk about it around the palace, but no one is foolish enough actually to send the fellow here.\"\n \"Narses is the first choice,\" Linos persisted. He looked at the men. \"And the Emperor is convinced that there is a plot among Belisarius and some of his officers to seize power. You might keep that in mind when you rush to defend him.\"\n There was a low sound from the officers like a growl, but they all resumed their departure, taking care to pay very little attention to Linos, who gave an exasperated sigh and settled back to wait for one of the more ambitious officers to come forth with information about Belisarius\u0027 activities.\n Text of a letter from Eugenia to Chrysanthos.\n To the officer Chrysanthos who holds the rank of Captain at the Holy Communion barracks.\n What can I have said or done that made you think I would be willing to accompany you to Africa under any circumstances whatever? What convinces you that your suit was anything more than a dalliance between us? How could you think that I would be willing to marry you?\n You suggest that losing the fortune left to me by my late husband would be compensated by your battle fees and favors you believe will be forthcoming as part of the rewards of your station. How absurd you are. You have little funds now and if you should be killed in battle or maimed, then you would have nothing and I would have sacrificed what little I possess for no reason other than the dubious advantage of a bed partner. That is readily available to me; my late husband\u0027s fortune is all that stands between me and penury, and you have nothing to offer in compensation that would have any use to me. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-25.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
