I hope you have not decided to do this out of devotion to Drosos\u0027 memory. You tell me that you want to find out what is left of the Library and to try to salvage any of the texts that might have escaped the fires. That, I probably need not remind you, is dangerous work; high risk for a dubious reward.\\n\\n You told me once that Drosos called you a monster and that you did not know how to convince him you are not. Olivia, he was right. We are are monsters, Olivia, never forget that. But we need not be monsters simply because we are.\\n\\n Some time soon, I, too, hope you can return to Roma. I know how hard it is to be drawn by your native earth. Why else would I be in a place like Naissus? In less than a month I will be back in my native mountains, and they will restore me in ways I need not explain to you.\\n\\n I am pleased to know that Niklos Aulirios is still with you.
