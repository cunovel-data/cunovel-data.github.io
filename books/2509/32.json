{"id":107718,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"\n You were wise to break off with Chrysanthos when you did, but of course you will see him here at the celebration. If there should be any trace of awkwardness, you have only to seek me out and I will deal with him appropriately.\n At my husband\u0027s request, I have asked Olivia Clemens to come, and she has accepted. We will do what we can for her, but she insists that she is not searching for a husband. But then, she has taken Drosos for her lover, and doubtless for the time being she has little need of one. If her sponsor should question her choice, then it might be different, for she could find her money withheld on the grounds that she is using it immorally. That might prove drastic, and all she need do then would be to marry Drosos and put her fortune in his hands instead of her sponsor\u0027s, but so far she has shown herself reluctant to do this.\n I want to advise you to wear something in light red with a good deal of gold and pearls. Not only is this most fitting in terms of the occasion, but I have learned that Justinian has said that he considers wearing pearls to be a tribute to his wife, and if that is the case, we are in an excellent position to make the most of this without seeming to be courting favor. Also, have your hair dressed with restraint; it is sometimes thought frivolous of widows to be too extravagant, at least that is what Theodora told me the last time we spoke, which was ten days ago. She had some very good advice that I will pass along to you. She said that few men really admire caprice except in a brief infatuation. If a woman seeks to secure a marriage contract then she must show herself sensible and determined for the good of her husband and those around him. We have discussed this before, of course, but I think that you do not always bear it in mind, and that is a mistake, my dear Eugenia. You continue to put men to the test with sudden and outrageous demands, and this cannot help you in your search. Try to be a little less fanciful in your dealings with men, especially these men, for it serves you ill to imagine more than has been offered. You might see if Drosos is willing to become intimate with you, for if he is not going to marry Olivia, he might as well marry you, for he stands in my husband\u0027s good favor and is a man of promise as well as some little fortune of his own.\n We will speak of this further when you come, and in the meantime, select your most luxurious clothes of red and gold, and let me advise you to wear the pearl-inlaid tablion, the large one with the rubies in the sigil of Christ.\n This by messenger at midafternoon with my affection,\n Antonina\n wife of General Belisarius\n 12\n By sunset Pope Sylvestros had reached Ostia, and as he waited to pass through the Porta Romana, he watched the carrion birds feast on the bodies of Ostrogoths hanging from the city walls.\n \"Name?\" demanded a grizzled officer, grubby, unshaven and red-eyed.\n \"Pope Sylvestros,\" he answered. \"From Constantinople.\"\n \"Business, Priest?\"\n \"I am here to speak with a ship owner,\" Pope Sylvestros answered vaguely.\n \"Pass,\" grunted the officer.\n At another time Pope Sylvestros might have taken time to criticize the laxness shown by the officer, but not now; he was not eager to be more closely questioned about his purpose here in Ostia. Meekly he did as he was ordered, and found himself in the narrow streets of the old port city.\n At the far end of the old wharves there was a tavern known as The Seagull. It had been there more than three hundred years and had established its own particular fame among the sailors who made up its patrons.\n Pope Sylvestros waited there at an evil-smelling table by the smaller fireplace. He held a cup of wine which he had been nursing long enough to earn him several nasty glances from the landlord, but he refused to buy more and fuddle his wits before his meeting with Ghornan, whose ship was supposed to have made port with the incoming tide. He felt in his sleeve for the fiftieth time for the lists he would offer the Captain.\n \"Food, Priest?\" snarled the landlord.\n \"I am correctly addressed as \u0027Pope.\u0027\" He wished God had bestowed a more impressive face upon him, but knew that his very ordinary features aided him in his work.\n \"Pope or priest, you have the same appetites as the rest of us; you\u0027re as venal as the next man, but you wrap it in homilies.\"\n \"I pray God will forgive your impiety,\" said Pope Sylvestros, his nervousness making his words sharp.\n \"Impiety!\" jeered the landlord. He lifted a large cup to his mouth and drank deeply. From the rosy state of his nose and cheeks, this was a habit with him. \"You meeting a Byzantine ship?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Totila gives rewards to those who sink Byzantine ships,\" the landlord said with satisfaction, adding as he watched Pope Sylvestros bless himself, \"You priests are all alike. You think that prayers and gestures make a difference. Any idiot can mumble—most of \u0027em do—but no one thinks that God does more than look after them in their affliction. Except for the likes of you.\" He started to laugh at his own bitter humor.\n \"In Constantinople you would not dare to speak so disrespectfully of the servants of God.\" Pope Sylvestros was deeply indignant and he was not willing to overlook the landlord\u0027s challenge.\n \"If I pour you another tot of wine, will you turn it into water to spite me?\" suggested the landlord.\n \"That\u0027s blasphemy, even in Italy.\"\n The landlord filled his own cup with the dark, raw wine that was standard fare at The Seagull. \"Who\u0027s to report me—you?\"\n In order to silence the landlord—and because he was growing increasingly anxious—Pope Sylvestros tossed him a silver coin and ordered more wine.\n \"Been away from home long?\" Now that he had money in his hand again, the landlord assumed a mendacious cordiality. He tested the coin in his teeth and counted out half a dozen dissimilar copper coins in change, flipping them in the air and showing the stumps of his teeth as Pope Sylvestros scrabbled to retrieve them. He was still hunkered down on the floor when the door to the tavern swung open and a squat-bodied sailor surged into The Seagull. He bellowed for wine and looked quickly around the room as if expecting to find armed men behind the tables and benches.\n \"I am Ghornan,\" he announced to the room, daring anyone to contradict him.\n \"That is your good fortune,\" was the landlord\u0027s laconic response. He poured wine into a large-sized cup and held it out to the newcomer. \"Three standard copper pieces; I don\u0027t care where they came from if the weight is right.\"\n Ghornan pulled the coins from the folds of the narrow pallium wound around his waist. \"Here. And this had better not be watered.\" He slammed down the coins, and without waiting for the landlord to put them in the small scale at the end of the counter, he trod the width of the room to stare down hard at Pope Sylvestros. \"Are you the one I\u0027m supposed to meet?\"\n \"I am Pope Sylvestros,\" he admitted, his voice going higher with each word.\n \"You\u0027ve lost flesh. I was told you were portly. You ought to go home to your wife.\" He straddled the bench. \"The Bishop of Roma doesn\u0027t like his clergy to marry. So far, he hasn\u0027t been able to stop it.\" He stared hard at Pope Sylvestros. \"What information do you have for me?\"\n \"I…\" He touched his sleeve but also inclined his head toward the landlord. \"If we were more private…\"\n \"Oh, you needn\u0027t worry about Gordius here. He knows that if he repeats a word of what he overhears, he\u0027ll have a second smile by morning.\" He drew his fingers across his own throat to illustrate his meaning.\n \"But there might be others who would pay to know what I tell you and that could lead to…\"\n With an ostentatious display of exhaustion—a yawn, a rubbing of his large, firm belly, a scratching of his chest—the landlord left his post behind the counter and made his way out of the taproom.\n \"You peawit,\" said Ghornan. \"Now he\u0027s suspicious and there\u0027s no telling what he might decide to do with what you tell me.\" He gestured with disgust and drank off his wine. \"He\u0027ll listen now, or his slaves will. Either way, I\u0027ll have to kill him before I leave.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t intend—\" Pope Sylvestros started.\n \"Whatever you intended, the harm\u0027s done now.\" He slammed his cup down. \"What you have had better be worth the trouble you\u0027re causing; that\u0027s all I can say.\"\n \"It is, Captain.\" Reluctantly Pope Sylvestros drew his lists from his sleeve and spread the sheets out on the table. Though the light in the tavern was poor and the pope\u0027s handwriting spidery at best, the two men poured over the pages and at the end of reading the first sheet, Pope Sylvestros could see the greedy interest in Captain Ghornan\u0027s eyes. \"There is something worth a risk or two here, don\u0027t you think?\" he could not resist prodding.\n \"True,\" agreed Ghornan as he got to his feet and poured himself another generous serving of wine. \"How far are these villas, did you say?\"\n \"The nearest is half a day\u0027s walk, the walls are still standing, and although the north side of it was put to the torch, most of the building is intact, including everything inside it.\" He had lowered his voice, leaning forward so that Captain Ghornan could hear everything he said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-32.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
