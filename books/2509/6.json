{"id":107693,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\n Regarding the alterations that this widow requires, it will take the workers a period of five months to accomplish most of the construction, and until it is complete arrangements may be made for this great lady to be the guest of the family of her sponsor, that is, the General Belisarius, and this will allow the majordomo Niklos Aulirios to oversee the construction to the satisfaction of his mistress.\n Witnessed by the Pope Phillipos and the Pope Alexis at Konstantinoupolis in the presence of myself, Andros Trachi, and the freedman Thalkas, who will be the one in charge of the construction to be done on the property changing hand.\n Prosperity, long life, and the favor of God to our great Emperor Justinian, who defends the honor of God on earth.\n An appended note, addressed to Olivia.\n Great lady,\n For the time you are in Konstantinoupolis, you may find that some of the customs are strange to you, and so that you do not fall into error, I, Andros Trachi, offer the advice of my wife to guide you in your first ventures here. Doubtless, since Romans are more lax than we, you have grown accustomed to a level of license that might ill-prepare you for the more decorous and dignified life of this great city. Doubtless you will not want to make yourself conspicuous with actions that are repugnant to those of breeding and distinction. What can be thought charming and eccentric in Roma could give offense in Konstantinoupolis, and lead to unpleasantness which you must wish to avoid.\n I look forward to being of service to you in this matter, and I am honored to have so great a lady purchasing the property that the General Belisarius has arranged for you to own.\n In Christian friendship,\n Andros Trachi\n 3\n Each footfall produced echoes, and both Olivia and Niklos had to resist the urge to tiptoe through the vast, empty rooms of the house that Olivia had purchased.\n \"And I did purchase it,\" she insisted to Niklos after they had endured the obsequious greeting of Andros Trachi. \"It\u0027s barbaric, their insistence that all negotiations be done by men.\"\n \"You mean, it isn\u0027t Roman.\"\n \"Not that Roma is much better, now,\" Olivia said quietly. \"Even a century ago, it was not so bad.\" She looked around the great gloomy vestibule. \"I suppose I\u0027ll grow accustomed to it.\"\n \"It is austere,\" said Niklos with a trace of amusement.\n \"It is tomblike,\" she said, her nose wrinkling. \"I expect it to smell of mold.\"\n \"But it doesn\u0027t; it smells of paint,\" said Niklos, indicating one of the walls where work had already begun.\n \"I trust that they will be finished soon; as much as I am grateful to Belisarius\u0027 cousin, I don\u0027t know how much longer I can endure to remain under the same roof with her. At least I had the opportunity of her hospitality so that I would not have to accept the kind offer\"—her voice was sweet with sarcasm—\"of that unctuous Trachi. I can think of few things I would have wanted less.\"\n \"And there are other considerations, are there not?\" said Niklos with genuine sympathy.\n Olivia did not answer at once; she paced down the room, peering at the ceiling as she went, then stopped and turned to Niklos again. \"Yes. Yes, there are.\"\n \"And you are not prepared. You have done nothing to prepare yourself,\" said Niklos in his most blunt manner. His warm brown eyes, almost reddish in cast, bored into hers.\n \"There was not much time,\" she began, then sighed. \"That\u0027s my excuse, of course, nothing more.\" She stared, unseeing, at the empty room. \"I had such hopes for Drosos. The first time he came to me, I remembered what it was I wanted most, and for a time, I had it again.\" Now her face softened and she laughed once, sadly. \"How rarely have my lovers cared more for me than themselves. Drosos truly enjoyed me, and I relished him.\"\n \"And the rest of it?\" asked Niklos, with a warning gesture to her to keep her voice low.\n \"Ah, yes, the rest of it. For now there is no risk from the rest of it,\" she reminded him. \"In time, there might be, but who is to say if there will be time? Drosos is still in Roma and I am here—in Constantinople.\" She was more adept than he at indirect speaking. \"Certainly something will have to be arranged in the interim, but I am not as concerned about that as you are. It is always possible to find something that will do for a while, even here.\"\n \"You, cynical?\" Niklos teased her with affection.\n \"I, practical. I, resigned, my friend, not cynical.\" She pulled the long folds of her bronze-colored paenula more closely around her. \"I don\u0027t care if they say this city is hot; I am chilled. There is a darkness here, a coldness that has nothing to do with the sun.\"\n \"Olivia, mistress, be careful who hears you complain. This place is different from Roma in many, many ways,\" said Niklos, once again looking toward the shadowed room that joined the vestibule.\n \"Romans, luckily, are expected to be impulsive and capricious. Didn\u0027t that dreadful Andros Trachi tell me so at length?\" She was moving restlessly once more. \"Everyone knows that we can accept no city but Roma as home, and that for us she is the center of the earth.\"\n Niklos followed her as she rushed into the larger of the two reception rooms that opened onto the vestibule. \"Nevertheless,\" he persisted, \"don\u0027t be too condemning. We are here on sufferance, and from what I can tell, we are not going to be accorded too much of that.\"\n \"Yes; yes. But from what I have seen, a mere widow, with or without a fortune, is hardly worth any attention, and one from Roma is little more than an amusement. It\u0027s our manner, you know, and our lack of propriety.\" There was not much annoyance in the tone of her voice, but the expression on her face was enough to make Niklos change the subject.\n \"Will you accept the invitation of Antonina? She is determined to fulfill her obligations to you for Belisarius\u0027 sake, if not your own. She has said she will introduce you to the best society of the city.\"\n \"And who can guess why,\" said Olivia as she made a swift inspection of the changes that were being wrought in the room. \"I suppose we have to have those dreary Saints everywhere, don\u0027t we? I already asked for an ikonostasis in my private rooms—so it will be understood that I am pious—is it really necessary to have another, do you think?\"\n \"The Emperor is a religious man, and his court follows his example,\" Niklos pointed out. \"And you are a sensible woman.\"\n \"At my age, I had better be,\" she said, and laughed again, this time with genuine mirth. \"Very well; see that we have another screen to load up with bad art, and a few more of those horrid hanging braziers for incense. And while you are being so protective, send a messenger to Antonina. I will call upon her later this afternoon if she is receiving anyone.\"\n \"And if she is not?\" inquired her majordomo.\n \"Then discover when she is prepared to have my company for an hour or so, and we will then arrange things to that purpose.\" She shrugged. \"I suppose I must do this eventually: why not now?\"\n Niklos did not answer, but his relief was apparent in the speed with which he carried out his orders.\n By the time the slave had been sent as a messenger to the enormous house of Belisarius, Olivia had completed her rounds of the house she had purchased and was ready to dress for the forthcoming visit. Since her last banquet in Roma, she had continued to choose subdued clothing and modest-but-costly ornaments to wear, sensing that this would offset some of the adverse attitudes the Byzantines had toward Romans.\n Still, she balked at the enclosed palanquin that Niklos had arranged for her transportation to Belisarius\u0027 house. \"I don\u0027t like being enclosed,\" she said as Niklos assisted the slaves in drawing the draperies around her.\n \"You are in Constantinople, and women of good reputation do not show themselves on the street except in going to the hippodrome and the market squares. The penitential processions also require that all women show themselves, but cover their faces for the Sin of Eve and the Fall of Man.\" He was stern with her, needing her to use her wits more than she had been willing to do.\n \"I might as well immure myself and be done with it—and I have done that already and found it appalling.\" She pulled the silken hanging closed with her own hands. \"If I do not speak to you when I return, it is your own fault, Greek.\"\n Since Olivia only called Niklos Greek when she was displeased with him, he did not respond, but stepped back and permitted the bearers to start off with their Roman burden.\n Belisarius\u0027 house was one hill over—although Olivia refused to think of such bumps as hills—and in a street that was made narrow with the extensive reconstruction and rebuilding that was the passion of Justinian. By the time the bearers set the palanquin down, they were sweating and blowing hard as dray beasts for the added effort of lifting the vehicle around the heaps of masonry and over piles of rubble that littered the streets increasingly as they neared the palace of the Emperor and his most ambitious project—the expansion of the Basilica of the Most Sacred Wisdom.\n Four armed guards uniformed in the manner of Belisarius personal soldiers flanked the door to the house as Olivia was helped from the palanquin. All the men watched her closely, each with a hand on the hilt of his sword. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-6.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
