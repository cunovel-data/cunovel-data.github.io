{"id":107721,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\"Yes; Niklos Aulirios,\" he said with a gesture that indicated he was willing to permit Simones to purchase the fish. \"Oh, that\u0027s right. You\u0027re Greek. I think the reason I didn\u0027t place you at first was that I can\u0027t remember that you aren\u0027t as Roman as your mistress.\" He handed over the coins to the fisherman without haggling and told the man where the sole was to be delivered. \"See that you send it at once; my mistress wishes to serve it this evening and it must be properly prepared.\" \"You\u0027re part of Belisarius\u0027 household, aren\u0027t you?\" asked Niklos as he moved away from the front of the booth. He shaded his eyes against the spring sun and watched as the eunuch made his way to his side. \"Yes. It is not so great an honor as it once was, but what slave is free to choose his master?\" The philosophical tone was belied by the discontented set of his mouth. \"Or what bondsman, if it comes to that?\" retorted Niklos as he indicated a booth where chilled wine mixed with honey and fruit juice was being sold. \"I have a few pieces of copper. Join me.\" \"You\u0027re being generous to a stranger,\" said Simones, hardly able to believe that their meeting was going so well. \"I am the stranger here. And I am curious about your mistress. Olivia Clemens has not had the pleasure of entertaining your mistress recently, and I was curious why.\" He found a bench and sat down so that the shadow of the nearest wall fell across him. \"My mistress has not gone out much since… recent events.\" Simones sighed. \"Even her good friend Eugenia has not been in the great lady\u0027s presence of late.\" \"Has the General returned yet?\" asked Niklos politely, although he knew that Belisarius had come back to Konstantinoupolis more than a week ago. \"Yes; at the Emperor\u0027s insistence, there was no official welcome.\" Simones ran his tongue over his lips, then wiped his brow with the cuff of his sleeve. \"From the rumors, welcome would not be the word for it,\" Niklos suggested, raising his hand to signal one of the serving slaves of the wine merchant. \"Sadly there is a rift between the General and the Emperor,\" said Simones at his most neutral. \"The Emperor fears that the General has become too used to command and wishes to expand his conquests.\" He watched Niklos carefully. \"Those who are Belisarius\u0027 friends are of interest to the Emperor, of course.\" \"Why of course?\" asked Niklos innocently, although he knew the answer before he asked his question. \"Because the Emperor wishes to know that he is secure,\" said Simones, doing his best to control his impatience. \"Bring us two of your nectars,\" said Niklos to the slave who approached them. \"And if there are any of those little cakes, one or two of them would be welcome, wouldn\u0027t they?\" This last was to Simones. \"They are tasty,\" he said curtly, wanting to guide Niklos back to the matter at hand. \"It is good of you to offer.\" \"Nonsense. It is good to find someone who is so cordial.\" In a Konstantinoupolitan Simones would have suspected that so gracious a remark hid sarcasm, but coming from Olivia\u0027s bondsman, he was confident that there was no ulterior message in the few words. \"I would be your friend, Niklos, if you would allow it. There are real advantages in my friendship.\" \"Are there?\" He took the two cups the serving slave brought and handed the youth three copper coins. \"For the drink and for your trouble.\" \"You Romans are always very free with money for slaves,\" Simones observed critically. \"It is a Roman custom, and my mistress keeps to Roman ways.\" He gave the larger cup to Simones. \"Long life and favor to the Emperor and our mistresses,\" toasted Niklos, though he only tasted the nectar before he set the cup down. \"Of course,\" Simones seconded, taking a deep draught of his drink. He wanted to resume control of their conversation without appearing too obvious. \"About your mistress. She knew Belisarius in Roma, didn\u0027t she?\" \"Yes. She gave him the use of her villa when she left and she received much assistance from your mistress for this.\" He looked at Simones. \"And surely you know this.\" \"Some of it. A man in my position cannot question his owner too closely.\" He tried to be self-effacing, but did not succeed entirely. \"Then you are aware that the friendship had its origins in Roma,\" Niklos declared. \"And you must know that my mistress owes your master a debt of gratitude for all he has done to assist her now that she lives in this city.\" \"I would have thought that such an honor belonged more to Drosos,\" said Simones with asperity before he could stop himself. \"Well, Drosos is Belisarius\u0027 Captain, isn\u0027t he?\" \"Yes,\" Simones agreed with polite savagery. He brought his rising temper under control. \"Does that mean that Belisarius took her as a lover?\" \"Saint Stephanos, no,\" Niklos said with a laugh, his dark, reddish eyes dancing. \"My mistress rarely consorts with men who have wives. There have been very few exceptions to the rule in all the time I have been with her.\" \"And that has been for a while, I gather,\" Simones prompted smoothly. \"Longer than you would think possible,\" Niklos confirmed with a touch of irony in his voice. \"And… you must forgive me for asking this, but I do not mean disrespect.\" He stared down into the cup. \"She is actually a widow, is she, and not simply a courtesan who has taken a convenient lie to cover her sins.\" His face grew sharp, almost predatory, but he did not realize that Niklos saw. \"She was widowed before I became her bondsman,\" said Niklos truthfully, not adding that he had been with her for more than two hundred years. \"Her husband was found guilty of treason and other crimes. For that reason alone, she was not eager to marry again.\" \"Such acts stick to wives, don\u0027t they?\" Simones said with a contemptuous turn of his mouth. Niklos said nothing but signaled for a second drink for Simones. \"Forgive me if I do not have another,\" he said to Antonina\u0027s eunuch slave. \"I have a poor head for wine.\" \"Sensible to know your limits,\" Simones said as if he approved; he made a note of this weakness with a sense of satisfaction. \"So my mistress tells me.\" He gave two more coins to the slave and waved the youth away. \"About your mistress,\" Simones continued ruthlessly, \"how is it that she prefers to live as she does?\" \"She is a Roman, my Greek friend, and she lives as a Roman woman of the highest class lives. If she would rather not be a wife, that does not make her a whore because she is not a religious.\" He smiled at reminiscences Simones could not share. \"There were times when her life would have been religious, but these things change.\" \"Do not say that where officers of the Court Censor can hear you. Kimon Athanatadies is not known for his sense of humor.\" Now Simones took a firmer stance with Niklos. \"You apparently are not aware of how different things are here in Konstantinoupolis. In Roma perhaps it is not a serious matter to question the ways of the Church. Here, the Emperor is no cynic whose faith is an act of politics. He is a man of true devotion, and his court is the same. If you wish to pass unscathed, then you will have to mend your ways.\" \"Is that what you have been trying to tell me?\" asked Niklos with an appreciative grin. \"I have been wondering what is your purpose in talking with me. You are worried that my mistress might say or do something unwise, and I am grateful that you, or more correctly your mistress, I suppose, are concerned on her behalf.\" As he spoke, letting himself rattle on foolishly, he watched Simones, looking for some indication of what Antonina\u0027s slave actually sought. \"Yes, I suppose my mistress is a little stubborn about how she lives. Romans are like that, you know. They must always be Roman, no matter how inappropriate it might be. I have wondered myself if it would be best to keep to the old ways here, but I am a bondsman, and it is not my place to correct the behavior of my mistress. Still, if things are as you imply, then I must do something to encourage her to reconsider.\" He stopped and pointed to the second cup. \"You\u0027re not drinking, Simones. Isn\u0027t this to your liking?\" \"It is pleasant,\" snapped Simones, his patience almost exhausted. \"You seem to think that this is nothing but an entertainment.\" \"Oh, no; I wouldn\u0027t make so grave an error,\" he said with mockery in the back of his eyes. \"You are trying to give me a message that has to do with my mistress. I realize that.\" Simones started to rise, then thought better of it. \"You have a little of the jist of it,\" he said with no attempt to make his words cordial. \"But you don\u0027t grasp the ramifications. If your mistress continues as she is now, she might well come under close scrutiny. Those who have been of assistance in any inquiry will escape the worst of the results of such scrutiny. If she is questioned, your prior assistance will be weighed in determining what culpability you share with her.\" Niklos stared, amazed at the blatant threat Simones offered. He had expected pressure but not coercion. \"I am a bondsman, and there are laws that limit what I may do,\" he said cautiously.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-35.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
