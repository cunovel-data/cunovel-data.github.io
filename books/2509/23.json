To be torn apart by wild beasts is hideous, but what of those women who were raped to death by wild asses?\" Olivia looked curiously at Antonina. \"What of them?\n \"They were not…\" Her words faded and she looked at Olivia with less distrust. \"What happened then could happen again, under different circumstances. There are those who lack all sympathy for those who insist on living apart from the world who do so for reasons that are not religious. And there is always great curiosity about such strange behavior. Don\u0027t you think so, Antonina?\"\n Antonina held a cube of broiled lamb over her mouth, but rather than eat, she set it aside, addressing Theodora with her most earnest demeanor. \"This is precisely what I have been trying to warn Olivia of, my most majestic Empress. It would appear that, so far, I have not been heeded, and that fills me with despair, for it is necessary that Olivia not be too lighthearted in her anticipation of these dangers.\"\n \"She\u0027s right,\" Theodora said, studying Olivia. \"You don\u0027t appreciate how dangerous these matters can be, and if you decide to ignore the danger, you are being foolish. From what I have heard of you, you are not a foolish creature, and so I must think that you are obstinate.\"\n \"There is some truth in that,\" Olivia allowed, her opinion of Theodora changing slightly.\n \"A Captain of the army has told me that you are not the sort of woman to permit herself to be taken advantage of, either through willful malice or through inept handling.\" She waited for Olivia to speak, and when her Roman guest said nothing, she continued, \"I think that it would be wise of you to take his warning to heart. He is not one to give himself pains except where he has given his fealty, and where that is given, it binds him unto death.\"\n \"I am aware of that, and I treasure it more than you know,\" said Olivia evenly.\n \"I thought that it was otherwise, that he had overestimated you through the depth of his feeling, but I think now that love has perhaps cleared rather than clouded his vision.\" Theodora sighed. \"As one who was not always where I am now, I know what dangers can stalk you. You do not wish to believe the warnings you have had. Let me tell you that they are given with affection and concern.\"\n \"Very well.\" Olivia turned her head so that she could meet Theodora\u0027s gaze evenly. \"I will not make light of any other warning, and I will take precautions, for the sake of the Captain of the army as well as for my own. I confess that your concern surprises me.\"\n \"It is as much for the Captain as for you, Roman lady. Also, you have not sought favor as many in your position have, and this intrigues me.\" She raised her head. \"Ah. They are about to start the second race. Watch! The grays are mine.\"\n As the next race started, Olivia sat back and wondered what the Empress Theodora might want for her warning; the things that occurred to her troubled her more than the warning had done.\n Text of a letter in Latin from Ragoczy Sanct Germain Franciscus.\n Hail to my treasured Olivia;\n I am relieved to learn of your decision to leave Roma. As difficult as it is to leave your native earth, there are times that it is the only sensible thing to do, and not simply because you are in the middle of a barbarian invasion. Remember that we cannot afford to attract too much attention to ourselves, for that often brings inquiry that is not to the advantage of those of our blood. As much as the restrictions of Constantinople infuriate you, they are preferable to being hacked to pieces by Totila\u0027s soldiers.\n The reason it has taken me so long to respond to your letter is that I am moving again. Your letter finally caught up with me after almost a year in coming. I write from Poetovio; I left Pons Saravi over a month ago and have had more difficulties and delays than any I can remember for four hundred years. At the moment I am bound for Trape-zus. I may remain there or go on to Rhagae in the Parthian Empire: this in case you decide to write again and are at a loss to know where to send the letter.\n Your Captain sounds remarkable and I wish you much joy with him, but I warn you not to withhold your secret too long, for if he is so cherished that you are willing to share blood with him, then he deserves to know what stakes he plays for—in any sense. I know how difficult this can be; I remember my own doubts before I told you what would happen at your death. He will need to prepare, as you prepared, my love. From what you have told me of Constantinople, this may not be easily done.\n Take care, Olivia. It would hurt me more deeply than you know if you should come to any harm. Know that you always may find a haven with me if I have one to offer, and know also that no matter where you are, my undying affection and care are with you.\n Sanct\u0027 Germain through the good offices of\n Huroghac, merchant from\n Mogontiacum traveling to\n Constantinople\n 9\n Belisarius looked up as the fourth dispatch rider in as many hours thundered into his camp on a lathered horse.\n One of his officers, an exhausted boy named Kylanthos, brought the rider to him. \"General Belisarius,\" he said, then took up his post at the entrance to the tent.\n The dispatch rider was not as scruffy as the previous three had been and this alone attracted Belisarius\u0027 attention. He rose from his narrow trestle table and came forward, \"I don\u0027t know you, do I?\"\n \"No, General,\" said the rider, his expression embarrassed.\n \"There have been so many changes of officers that I am not always sure.\" His apology was accompanied by a worn smile. \"I hope you bring me better news than the others have done, for I am not in a good humor to sustain more disappointments.\"\n \"I bring you news from Constantinople. I landed only yesterday and have been in the saddle most of the time since then.\" He spoke with the zeal of a newcomer and was privately shocked when this announcement did not produce the excitement he anticipated.\n \"What is it this time?\" Belisarius asked, hardly doing more than nodding once to show his respect for the Emperor. \"Don\u0027t be upset, young man. Most of the men here have been on campaign with short rations for the last five days and we are all feeling hungry and fatigued. What message do you bring me? More delays?\"\n The rider\u0027s enthusiasm did not include a denial of the poor provisioning Belisarius\u0027 troops had experienced and he could not pretend that the General lacked reason for his behavior. He stood a little straighter and faced the older man. \"I bring welcome news then; Captain Hyperion has landed at Rhegium with men, supplies and monies, and they are making their way northward to join with you in the attempt to take Roma from the invaders.\" He grinned, holding out his dispatches again. \"Read for yourself.\"\n Belisarius took the scrolls and broke the seals on all three of them. He read slowly, pausing once to say that his eyes hurt. \"I\u0027ve been on campaign too long, I think,\" he went on, glancing at the rider. \"There are days when by sundown my eyes burn in my head. But for news like this, I am willing to have them turn into living coals.\"\n The rider looked embarrassed. \"General…\"\n \"I say the same thing to my officers. Or I used to, when I could still remember who they were.\" He continued to read and shook his head. \"More replacements. And they are all unfamiliar to me. Why does the Emperor remove my officers so frequently? How am I supposed to fight with strangers?\"\n \"The Emperor,\" the rider reminded Belisarius stiffly, \"does not need to account to you. If he knows that this must be done, then his will is sufficient.\"\n \"Of course,\" Belisarius said. \"But when you have been in the field a while, you will want tested comrades beside you. All soldiers feel that, since those comrades are often all that stands between the soldier and death.\" He lifted the scroll. \"To have eight new officers is all well and good, but nine of my staff are being recalled. They none of them have been with me longer than a year, but they are the closest thing to a cadre that I have now. To learn the ways of the new ones, and for them to learn my ways will take time, and we have little of that.\" He finished reading the first scroll and set it aside. \"Very well, I will prepare for the new officers. This is from the Censor, and I will read the words of Justinian before the Censor\u0027s.\"\n The rider nodded, since anything else would be intolerable. \"The Censor is devoted to the Emperor.\"\n Belisarius hardly responded; his brows had drawn together and he tensed visibly as he read. \"How can!…\"he burst out once, but read the rest in silence.\n \"The Emperor is not truly pleased with the progress being made here,\" the rider said apologetically, revealing that he knew of the contents of the second dispatch.\n \"That is very much apparent,\" Belisarius said darkly. \"He has been at pains to explain to me.\"\n The rider folded his arms. \"General, the Emperor is concerned for what has been happening here.\"\n \"That, too, is obvious.\" He moved abruptly to the door flap of his tent. \"But it is not true that I deliberately lost Roma. If I had had the men and the supplies we could have held the city and moved Totila\u0027s army back to the north. But without men and supplies my hands were tied. If Justinian believes otherwise then he has poor advisors. Every officer who came to Italy with me was dedicated to winning back all of the old Roman Empire for Justinian. I vouch for every one of them. They desired to serve the Emperor in the field and were willing to give their lives if it were necessary to gain that end. But now, I hardly know the names of the men who carry out my orders, and we have had to wage war with insufficient food and equipment. No army can continue in that way!\" He paced the small confines of his tent. \"I cannot accept that Justinian does not understand this, but from what he has said to me, it is clear that he does not, or that he does not know how depleted we have been.\" He sighed abruptly. \"I should not say this, least of all to you. I am the Emperor\u0027s General, and it is my task to carry out his orders. I have not been able to, and the reasons hardly matter, do they?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-23.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
