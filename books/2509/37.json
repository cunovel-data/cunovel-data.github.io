I thought there would be good fellowship and sensible actions because we would grow wiser and more caring.\" She put the scroll back in its pigeon hole, then glanced over at the small ikonostasis. \"I feel as if all our time is spent in terrible darkness, and that if we are fortunate, from time to time we stumble into a little light. If we are not too frightened of what we see, we huddle around it, like traders in the desert at their fires. But most are terrified or blinded, and they seek the darkness again, preferring that to—\" She shook her head. \"Forgive me.\"\\n\\n \"Always,\" said Niklos, more moved by what she had said than he wanted to admit.\\n\\n This time her smile was genuine. \"You\u0027re too good to me, old friend.\"\\n\\n \"Me? Never.\" He came to her side, kissed her cheek, and went to the door. \"Zejhil, tomorrow morning.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"I suppose I must.\" She turned away and did not look back again when she heard him close the door.\\n\\n Text of a letter to Olivia from Sanct Germain.\\n\\n To my most cherished Olivia, hail from Perath.\\n\\n Your letter reached me after five months, which is good time, or so I am informed. For the next year I will be here at Perath and can be reached at the House of Foreign Scholars. I hope you will send me word of how you are, for you seemed unhappy with your life in Constantinople, and that saddens me. You have already endured so much, and to have that haven denied you grieves me more than I can tell you.\\n\\n How good to know that Drosos is with you. He may not be able to compensate for your vexation, but surely you find some consolation in his company. Love given so honestly is rare indeed, as you and I both have cause to know. It has been many, many years since I knew such intimacy; thinking back, I cannot recall such profound rapture since you and I were lovers. Treasure your Captain Drosos, Olivia.\\n\\n You say that you suspect Belisarius will be removed from command, and you believe that it is foolish. Of course it is. But are you surprised, you who saw the Year of the Four Caesars and knew Tigellinus? If Belisarius is the man you say he is, no Emperor could tolerate having him in power; as it is he is a living rebuke to Justinian.\\n\\n This hardly provides the comfort I wish I could give you, and for that I rely on your understanding. There are so few things I can offer at this distance, and that distresses me. Still, in spite of it all, this brings you my enduring love.\\n\\n Sanct Germain\\n\\n his seal, the eclipse\\n\\n by the good offices\\n\\n of Brother Petros\\n\\n on pilgrimage to Roma\\n\\n 2\\n\\n Captain Vlamos strove to hide his embarrassment. \"I have to take your sword as well, General,\" he said to Belisarius as he and his men waited in the vestibule of Belisarius\u0027 house.\\n\\n \"Why? Who is there for me to use it on but myself?\" Belisarius asked with a bitter laugh. \"Or is that Justinian\u0027s fear? Does he think I will deprive him of my shame?\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t wise to speak so to us, General,\" Vlamos said stiffly. \"The Emperor has given his orders and we are his sworn officers. There is nothing—\"\\n\\n Belisarius held up his hand to stop this confession. \"I am also his sworn officer, little as he believes it.\" He reached down and unbuckled his sword. \"Take it. It\u0027s only a symbol, but that is enough. The Emperor has already taken my personal guard, and he has restricted my movements.\"\\n\\n \"General.\" Vlamos held the sword as if he expected it to strike of its own accord.\\n\\n \"Well, he is Emperor and I am his General, no matter what he believes, and I will be his General unto death.\"\\n\\n He pinched the bridge of his nose and rubbed his eyes. \"I will do what I am able to, and I will strive to understand what it is that he wishes of me.\"\\n\\n \"He wishes your loyalty, General,\" said Vlamos, delivering this statement with the stiffness of one repeating a lesson by rote.\\n\\n \"Then he has his wish,\" said Belisarius, suddenly weary and out of patience with the ceremony. \"I have always been loyal, and I will always be loyal. It sorrows me that the Emperor is not aware of this, but I can do little but protest. Those who have told the Emperor anything else of me lie. Those who have sought to have me removed from command for fear that I might use my position against Justinian do so without justification.\" He folded his arms. \"Will you inform Justinian of this?\"\\n\\n \"We are to give our report to Kimon Athanatadies, and he will present a report to the Emperor,\" Vlamos said, being as meticulous as he could. \"I am only Captain of the Guard; I cannot address the Emperor directly.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s new,\" said Belisarius, surprised at the information. \"How long has this been the case?\"\\n\\n \"A year.\" He looked away from Belisarius, fixing his gaze on the murals of martyred saints. \"It has been determined that the Emperor requires… less interference from those who are not of true importance to the Empire.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a mistake, especially if the Censor thinks that the Captain of the Guard is not important to the Empire,\" said Belisarius dryly. \"He could come to regret that decision one day.\"\\n\\n \"Is that meant—\" Vlamos started.\\n\\n \"As a word of caution, nothing more. If a man does not think those who guard him are important, he invites problems. I was thinking of the Caesars who were overthrown by the Praetorian Guard, who watched over them.\"\\n\\n \"We are not Praetorians,\" Vlamos pointed out uneasily.\\n\\n \"No, but Justinian might err as the Caesars did,\" Belisarius said. \"It would grieve me if that were to happen.\" He glanced at the other officers with Vlamos. \"Is that all, or is there something more we must do before this is over?\"\\n\\n \"I must announce to your household what is and is not permitted here now that the Emperor has removed your command and your personal guard.\" Vlamos coughed, the only display of emotion he permitted himself.\\n\\n \"Must it be the whole household, or can I limit it to the majordomo, who will give orders to the rest?\" He thought it galling that he would have to face his slaves at this time; it was sufficiently degrading to be denounced before soldiers; to have the terms of his disgrace announced to his slaves was intolerable.\\n\\n Although Vlamos had been told to give the orders to every member of the household, he said, \"The family and majordomo will suffice.\" He would deal with his reprimand—and there would surely be one—later.\\n\\n \"Very well.\" He clapped his hands. \"Simones! Arius!\" The summons was sharp and loud as orders on a battlefield. \"Come here. Bring your mistress and her aunt. And my brother.\" For the first time in his life, he was grateful that he had no children, and that as a bastard, he could not directly dishonor his father.\\n\\n Vlamos and his men waited in silence while the summoned members of the household came to the vestibule and stood in front of the murals of the suffering holy men.\\n\\n Simones and Arius stood apart from the rest, both attentive, both curious. They knew that Antonina was consumed with rage at the way Justinian was treating her husband, and both wondered if she would be able to contain her wrath during the proceedings. Both slaves waited as Captain Vlamos prepared to recite the Emperor\u0027s mandate.\\n\\n \"General Belisarius,\" Vlamos declared with almost no inflection. \"You are required to give up your command and all claims to command. You are to surrender your personal guard and all personal support of those guards. You will be permitted to maintain your house and your fortune in the manner you wish as long as you do not have guards or the support of guards as part of it. You are not to receive any military officers without the presence of a pope or an officer of the Censor in attendance, and any defiance of this requirement will bring with it an assumption of treason on the part not only of General Belisarius but of the officer in question. If the General is as devoted to the Emperor as he insists, he will be at pains not to implicate his officers in any possible guilt. The members of General Belisarius\u0027 household may not consort with members of the households of other military officers but in the presence of a pope or an officer of the Censor. This restriction includes all female members of the household in their dealings with the females of other households.\"\\n\\n Antonina gave a short, stifled cry, but said nothing more. Her aunt, a little, wizened creature in a simple dark brown paenula, reached over and put her hand on Antonina\u0027s arm.\\n\\n \"There is not to be written communication of any kind between General Belisarius and any military officer,\" Captain Vlamos went on, \"except if it has been read and copied by an officer of the Court Censor. Any communication that is clandestine will be assumed to be treasonous, and will result in imprisonment of the officer involved in the communication.\"\\n\\n \"Is that all?\" Belisarius asked when Vlamos fell silent.\\n\\n \"For the time being,\" Vlamos answered. \"I\u0027m sorry, General. I have to say it that way.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry too, Captain,\" said Belisarius heavily. \"All right, you may tell whomever-it-is you report to that I have heard Justinian\u0027s strictures and I will abide by them, though I maintain now, as I have from the first of this regrettable misunderstanding, that there is no need for the Emperor to take these precautions, and I will pray God every day that the Emperor will come to know this for himself.\" He made a small reverence to Captain Vlamos. \"Thank you for discharging your duty.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-37.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \\n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
