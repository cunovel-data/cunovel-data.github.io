I know that our love cannot be what it was before I came into your life, but that does not mean I have to deny that I miss it. Perhaps, when the worst of this is over, there will be time to write more fully, to tell you things that I cannot yet put down in words. Until then, have care, my precious friend, my old love. This world would be far drearier than it already is if you were no longer in it. With my enduring love, and you alone appreciate my meaning, Olivia in Constantinople 4 Panaigios was more nervous than the last time he had spoken with Simones. His fingers moved almost constantly, now at his pallium, now at the hem of his sleeves, now at the large, pearl-encrusted cross he wore around his neck. He indicated a small, unpadded bench and waited while Simones sat, then cleared his throat. \"You have said that you have made a discovery?\" \"Yes,\" Simones replied without any aggrandizement to the secretary of the Censor. \"I sent you word of it three days ago.\" \"I have your note somewhere,\" Panaigios said, leafing through the sheets of vellum and parchment that lay on his writing table. There were even a few sheets of Egyptian paper which Simones found surprising. \"Here it is. You say here that you\"—he held up a strip of vellum—\"have found material that would be of great value to me and to the Censor and the Emperor. You say nothing more about what this material is. Since you describe this as material, I have assumed that you have come upon a document of some sort that has some bearing on the investigation the Censor has been pursuing in regard to your master. Have I erred in any of these assumptions?\" \"Not very much, no,\" said Simones. \"I have also assumed that you have some reason for withholding the material itself—would it be missed?\" He braced his elbows on the table and leaned forward. \"If that is the trouble, it is possible that a writ to search the house of Belisarius could be obtained from the Emperor. He is eager to learn of anything bearing on the conspiracy that Belisarius claims he has not participated in. Would this material be related to that question?\" He was speaking fast and in breathless little spurts, and when he finished, he coughed once. Simones leaned back. \"I am prepared to show you something that would establish my master\u0027s role in the conspiracy. It isn\u0027t necessary to get a writ and search the house. I can put my hands on the thing at any time, and if I choose when it is to be shown, it will not be missed.\" He folded his hands and caught them around his knee. \"I want to be certain of my position in this before I go any further. Denouncing my master is a dangerous thing, and I do not want to place myself in the position of a sacrifice.\" He nodded at the startled glance Panaigios threw him. \"Oh, yes, I have wondered if you were going to use me as the means to be rid of Belisarius and then you would be rid of me, as well.\" \"It…it isn\u0027t the way the Censor… manages these things,\" said Panaigios with unconvincing sincerity. \"I doubt that,\" Simones said. \"I have heard of slaves who disappear with their masters when the masters have been shown to be enemies of the Emperor. I would not say the names, for they aren\u0027t to be spoken, are they?\" \"You are insolent,\" Panaigios snapped. \"Certainly.\" Simones showed his teeth. \"I am serving two masters, which means that I must weigh my own interests.\" \"Insolent slaves suffer for it.\" Panaigios held up the vellum. \"I have this, and it places you as my agent, if I am willing to say that you have worked on my authority. If I do not say you have my authority, then you are a slave who has betrayed his master. I will have no more insolence from you.\" He slammed the palm of his hand on the writing table for emphasis. There was a faint sheen of sweat on his brow. Simones straightened up. \"I have other notes from you; I have kept them. They give instructions and they have your name on them.\" He folded his arms. \"I have two things to discuss. I have mentioned the material about the conspiracy. I also want to inform you that my mistress continues to suffer declining health and it is not likely she will live more than a year given her problem.\" \"Poison,\" said Panaigios. \"Yes. It continues to be administered. The man who gives her the poison still does not know who has required her death. He thinks it is someone in the household, but he does not suspect me. In fact, he once asked me who might wish ill on Antonina.\" He leaned forward. \"I have enrolled the aid of Eugenia, who was once the close friend of my mistress, to observe her and learn from her.\" \"You said that you had the support of a friend; was this what you meant?\" Panaigios tapped his fingers on the piled sheets on his writing table. \"Yes. When I reported my intentions, you encouraged me. I have tried to be useful to you.\" His eyes hardened. \"I want you to be useful to me, as well.\" Panaigios dismissed this with a wave of his hand. \"When we have learned all that we require, then a decision will be made regarding you, but not until that time.\" He waited. \"Tell me more about this material.\" \"It shows that my master was part of a conspiracy. I will be happy to produce it as soon as I am assured that I will not suffer the same fate as my master and his household. I want a promise of manumission and I want the assurance that I will be paid for what I supply.\" He leaned back. \"Until these things are arranged, I will not show you this material.\" Panaigios sighed. \"I cannot give you any such assurance. It isn\u0027t my place to do so. If you think that you must have some guarantee, then the Censor must be the one to decide it.\" He started to gather up the vellum sheets. \"I will speak of this to my master.\" \"If you do not give me the things I ask for, the material will disappear.\" Simones gave another of his lupine smiles. \"What?\" Panaigios stopped his work and stared at Simones. \"Are you threatening to destroy proof of treason?\" \"Unless I obtain what I want.\" Simones raised his head, his strong jaw more prominent than usual. Panaigios stacked all the sheets together, watching his hands as he did. \"Let me warn you, slave, that you are placing yourself in grave danger.\" Simones chuckled. \"I have been in danger from the start of this. It is nothing new to me.\" \"Then you have not considered your role in this. You have convinced yourself that you are indispensable to our investigation, and you are not. You are a slave and you have been convinced that your assistance—assistance, not direction—is needed in order to determine what your master\u0027s part has been in any plot against the Emperor. To imagine otherwise is a grave mistake. You are not the person who guides this inquiry, the Court Censor is, and all of us are his tools.\" He said the last in a lowered tone, but with an expression that was both severe and desolate. Simones heard this out with a mixture of impatience and rancor. \"You are his tool as well, of course,\" he said at last, intending to insult Panaigios. \"Certainly. We are all his tools, and he is the tool of the Emperor.\" Panaigios waited a moment, then said more briskly, \"If you have knowledge, not suspicion but knowledge, which can link Belisarius directly to a conspiracy, then you must give it to me at once, for to withhold it is a greater treason than the action that inspired it.\" \"What?\" Simones said, for the first time frightened of the Censor\u0027s secretary. Panaigios nodded twice. \"If you do not produce this material, whatever it is, and do so at once, then you are knowingly aiding those who oppose the Emperor, and that is a treasonable act.\" Simones drew back, disliking the firm attitude Panaigios was showing now. \"I… I am not quite certain that I can put my hands on the material.\" \"You had better be, or your accusations will be relayed to your master and he can deal with your insubordination.\" Panaigios stood up. \"You have two days to accomplish this. If you do not, then I will have to review your position with this investigation. Whatever the decision, you will not be permitted to act as independently as you have in the past, for it is obvious that like most slaves, you cannot handle any authority.\" \"You are wrong!\" Simones said with force as he got to his feet. His face had darkened and his eyes were huge. \"You came to me, and you gave me orders that required I act against my master. It was on your orders that I have done the things I\u0027ve done, and you are the one who must be responsible for whatever I have done and whatever I will do.\" He was breathing hard, as if he had just run a long way. \"You are a slave.\" Panaigios stepped back. \"I dismiss you until you have considered your situation closely and have made up your mind what you intend to do. I will not stop you from making any decision you wish, but I warn you now that there is very little chance you will be excused if it turns out that your allegations are false. The malice of slaves is well-known, and you are no exception to that rule.\" He indicated the outer door. \"I hope you will not dawdle.\" It took all the control Simones had learned over the years for him to leave the room without smashing his fist into Panaigios\u0027 face. He made a reverence and touched his collar in a gesture of submission, then turned sharply on his heel. \"I will find the material,\" he vowed, wishing now that he had taken the time to plant such a document within Belisarius\u0027 house. There might not be a chance now that the Censor\u0027s men were on the alert. He cursed Panaigios and himself as he strode from the palace of the Censor.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-72.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
