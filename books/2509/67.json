He scowled as the door opened. \"What—\" As soon as he saw who it was, he changed his attitude. \"Zejhil. What\u0027s the matter, girl? You look as if you\u0027ve dragged a bale of silk from Antioch to Damascus.\"\\n\\n She shut the door firmly and took a hesitant step toward him. \"You… you said that if I heard anything I was to tell you…\"\\n\\n Niklos was now very attentive. \"Yes. And you have been very good in that regard. What have you heard now?\" He got up from the tall stool and came toward her. \"Zejhil?\"\\n\\n \"I was in the garden,\" she said, motioning him away from her. \"I didn\u0027t think that anyone else was there, but they were.\"\\n\\n \"Who was there?\" His curiosity was turning to worry. \"What did you hear, Zejhil? What did you see?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t see anything,\" she said. She was bent over slightly, her arms crossed over her abdomen as if she were in pain. \"I only heard.\"\\n\\n \"Are you all right? Did anyone harm you?\" He ignored her warning and came to her side.\\n\\n \"Not harm, no. I said I didn\u0027t see them. They didn\u0027t do anything to me, but I heard them. I heard them.\" She looked up at him. \"There was a man I did not know. He was talking with Valerios.\"\\n\\n \"Valerios?\" said Niklos, more puzzled than before.\\n\\n \"He—the stranger—was offering Valerios money for information about our mistress. He said that if there was any trouble for him, the stranger would say that Valerios was acting for the Court Censor.\" She began to cry from terror. \"If it is so, if the Censor is trying to impugn our mistress, then there is no hope for us and we are all doomed.\"\\n\\n Niklos put his arm around Zejhil\u0027s shoulder and held her as he would have held a frightened child. \"No, no, Zejhil. If the Censor wishes to learn about Olivia, he will have to do more than spy on her slaves, or make spies of them. Even the Greek male slaves.\"\\n\\n \"The man was so… malignant.\" She trembled. \"I have not heard anyone speak so, not ever.\"\\n\\n \"There are malignant people in the world, Zejhil. It is a pity for everyone, but it is so.\" He smoothed her hair back from her face. \"But there have been no accusations made and until there are, even the Censor can do nothing. Olivia has kept to the laws; she has done what her sponsor has required of her, and if she—\"\\n\\n \"She is a friend of Belisarius and Drosos.\" She said this as if she expected castigation for speaking those two names aloud.\\n\\n \"Yes, and she will continue to be, if I know her,\" said Niklos. Without seeming to do so, he guided Zejhil across the room to a wooden chair. \"Sit, Zejhil.\"\\n\\n Obediently she did. She clasped her hands together in her lap and waited for what would come next. \"I am afraid,\" she said simply.\\n\\n \"I know,\" Niklos responded, and laid his hand on hers. \"I wish you would trust us. Neither Olivia or I will let any harm befall you. Olivia does not require her slaves to suffer for her. If there are charges brought against her, she will free all of you before she answers them.\"\\n\\n \"There won\u0027t be time. She will have to ask her sponsor to do that, and if she is accused, no sponsor will permit her to do that.\" Zejhil started to rise, then sank back.\\n\\n \"It is already arranged,\" Niklos said quietly. \"I rely on you to keep that to yourself.\"\\n\\n Zejhil stared at him. \"What do you mean, it is already arranged?\"\\n\\n \"She has the writs with her sponsor\u0027s approval in her documents. She has only to affix a date and sign them.\" He shook his head. \"I have said you could trust her. She knows that her position grows more precarious, and if she were permitted she would leave Konstantinoupolis.\"\\n\\n \"But she is not permitted?\" said Zejhil.\\n\\n \"Not yet,\" said Niklos. There were alternate plans he and Olivia had made, but they were to be used only when all other means were exhausted: of these he said nothing.\\n\\n \"Then the stranger I heard could—\"\\n\\n \"You have done very good work, for you have put us on our guard before the others are aware of it.\" He started to pace. \"I want you to speak with Olivia later tonight, after most of the others have gone to bed. I will give you an order while you have your evening meal so that none of the others will pay any attention to what you do.\"\\n\\n \"What should I do until then?\" She waited as if expecting revelation.\\n\\n \"What you usually do.\" He read confusion in her face and went on. \"If you change what you do, there are those who will notice, and if Valerios has truly been approached, it may be that others have, as well. In which case, everything should appear as normal as possible to keep any potential spy from suspecting that he has been found out.\" Niklos studied her reaction. \"I trust you will aid us?\"\\n\\n \"How could you doubt it?\" She rose out of the chair and came toward him. \"If anyone tried to hurt you—\"\\n\\n He stopped her with a swift, kind gesture. \"For that I am more grateful than you can imagine, Zejhil.\"\\n\\n Her angular face went crimson. \"I—\"\\n\\n \"You are a very good woman, Zejhil; before you are anything else, you are a very good woman.\" He took her hand. \"Now, go about your work, and know that our mistress and I thank you for what you have done.\"\\n\\n She nodded, the blush fading. \"I will. And when you summon me, I will be ready.\"\\n\\n \"Excellent. Now leave me alone. I have to think.\" He escorted her to the door and saw her go down the hallway; then, when she had turned the corner, he left the room and went in search of Valerios. It took some time for he was not where Niklos expected to find him.\\n\\n \"What—?\" Valerios burst out as Niklos stepped into the small room near the kitchen where furniture was made and repaired. He was wearing a leather apron and had a leather-headed mallet in his hand. Between his legs he held one of the cooks\u0027 benches, with two new legs just being fit into place.\\n\\n \"I thought you would be in the vestibule,\" Niklos said as if the two men were in the middle of a conversation. \"You were adding a new screen to the ikonostasis, weren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" He hammered the mallet down on the legs. \"But the cooks needed this urgently. Since the great lady wasn\u0027t as pressed for the new screen, I decided to—\" He interrupted himself with his work.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re an industrious fellow, Valerios. They breed you hardy in—where is it you are from?\" Niklos leaned on the doorframe, arms folded.\\n\\n \"Thessalonica,\" he said, accompanying the word with two heavy blows.\\n\\n \"A distinguished place with a long history,\" said Niklos, very much at his ease.\\n\\n \"So I\u0027ve heard.\" He tested one of the legs and glowered at it. \"Is there something I have to do? If there isn\u0027t, I want to get this finished for the cooks.\"\\n\\n Niklos crossed one leg over the other, resting the foot on the toe of his sandal. \"Yes, come to think of it, there is something you can do: you can answer a few questions.\"\\n\\n This time the mallet faltered in its descent. \"What questions?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing too difficult, I imagine.\" His mouth curved but there was no smile in his eyes. \"I understand that you had an interesting offer earlier today. Would you like to tell me about it, or would you rather I guess?\"\\n\\n The mallet struck awry, the force of the impact almost pulling the bench from the grip between his knees.\\n\\n Valerios cursed, then said, \"An offer? What sort of offer?\"\\n\\n \"I understand,\" Niklos said, unperturbed, \"that someone was willing to pay you for information. Someone wanted to know certain things about this household and for unknown reasons was not willing to approach either our mistress or me directly.\" He paused, sensing Valerios\u0027 tension. \"Why was that, Valerios?\"\\n\\n \"I…I know nothing about that. Whoever says such things is lying.\" His protest was far from convincing.\\n\\n \"Really? You mean no one came here, saying that you would not be blamed for any ill you did because you were working for the Court Censor?\" He asked this with innocence a cat would envy. \"I was told you refused.\"\\n\\n Valerios swung the mallet and then flung it to the far side of the room. \"All right!\" he shouted. \"All right. There was a man, a slave. He had been here before and asked about Captain Drosos. I told him that the Captain had been here. I didn\u0027t think that there was any harm in that. Everyone in the household knew about it and it\u0027s not as if the mistress has made a secret of her dealings with him.\"\\n\\n \"Did he pay you then?\" Niklos inquired sweetly.\\n\\n \"Two silver coins,\" Valerios admitted.\\n\\n \"You said nothing of it.\"\\n\\n Valerios shrugged defensively. \"I didn\u0027t think anything of it. There was nothing secret.\"\\n\\n \"Except the inquiry,\" Niklos pointed out. \"Who was this man? Other than a slave?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-67.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \\n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
