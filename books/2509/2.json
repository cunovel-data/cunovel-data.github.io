{"id":107689,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"And,\" the oldest went on with a nod to the others, \"there are those who need to find out what has been taken, what is missing, and where the thieves are taking their booty. The price of certain foods has already more than doubled, and I have spoken with the Guard Tribune who has said that they cannot stem the tide. With so many fleeing, all a thief has to say is that he bought an item from one of the Romans on the road; unless there is good reason to doubt him, no one will question such a statement. For one thing, no one has the time to carry on an investigation, and for another the Guard has more to do than inspect baggage for contraband and loot.\" A fourth man, very lean and wearing the most elaborate palmata wound over his tunica, spoke at last. \"There are slaves escaping, too. Some have killed their owners and taken treasure, confident that all they need do is remove their collars to be free of their state and the consequences of their acts.\" Absentmindedly Belisarius fingered the metal torque around his neck that indicated his rank, thinking—and not for the first time—that it was oddly appropriate that his rank and a slave\u0027s should be indicated by a collar. That his was studded with amber did not alter its impact for him. \"Most slaves are branded, aren\u0027t they? They can be rid of the collars, but not of the brands.\" Under his bracchae his legs were scarred, a General\u0027s brand, he told himself. \"But the brands are on the thigh or upper arm. It would mean another inspection,\" pointed out the oldest. \"I believe Lepidius is correct, that there are slaves taking advantage of this troubled time to flee, but there are others, certainly there are others legitimately seeking their owners and trying to conduct themselves according to the laws of God and man.\" \"It isn\u0027t practical to inspect every person coming through the city\u0027s gates,\" allowed the one monk in the group. \"It isn\u0027t practical to permit the kind of influx we have, but no one is concerned about that,\" said the one called Lepidius. \"What would be the point?\" asked Belisarius. \"The problem is already upon us, and there is nothing to change that. No one can ignore it, and for that reason, we must deal with it.\" He stretched out his legs and crossed them at the ankles, feeling the leather rub against his skin. Years ago he would have found blisters when his boots were removed, but now there were calluses on his hands and feet that prevented this. \"Let me say that it would not be wise to close the city tomorrow, no matter how sensible the plan may appear to you.\" \"Why not?\" demanded the youngest man. \"Are you unwilling to spare the men to aid us?\" His face darkened with the accusation. \"No,\" said Belisarius, although this was not completely true. \"No, I am thinking of what would happen when you opened the gates once more. There would be a riot at the least, for there are those outside the gates more desperate than you. They are without homes and they are hungry. Most of them would not hesitate to seize anything they needed from what they can find here, and the longer they are denied, the more forceful they will be when the chance is afforded them.\" \"And you think that troops would not deter them?\" asked the one with the darkest beard. \"I think that an army would not deter them,\" said Belisarius. \"They have nothing to lose. You have much at risk. Therefore they will do more than you to get what they need. What is the threat of a lance if you have not eaten for two days? At most it ends your hunger, at least it—\" \"We will close and bar our houses,\" the youngest assured the General. \"That will give protection of a kind for a while, until someone breaks down the door, and then there will be worse carnage than there might have been at first,\" Belisarius said. \"I have seen this before, and I will see it again many times before I die, if God grants me life.\" \"Does that mean you will do nothing?\" \"Lepidius,\" said Belisarius, grateful that he had one name he could use for this delegation. \"Listen to me. Most of those who are on the road outside the gates have left all they had behind. They are tired, they are hungry and they are filled with dread for tomorrow. You cannot change that. They will not stop, they will not go away no matter how much you wish they would, and they will not listen to you should you plead with them to spare you. No matter how sensible, how reasonable your requests may be, they will mean nothing to a man who has lost his fortune and his family. Do you understand that?\" \"But you are here with armed men. You can bring your army here to supervise the departure of the Romans. They are rabble, nothing more.\" The monk had a deep, stern voice and he used it now to good effect; the others nodded their support. \"Armed men, you say? Not prayers?\" Belisarius made no effort to keep the irony out of his voice. \"You are a man of God, your robes proclaim your calling, and yet you come to ask for an army to assist you.\" \"God favors those who are willing to act,\" said the monk. \"God demands our faith in Him and our use of the reason He gave us through our First Parents in Eden.\" The one with the darkest beard was the first to endorse the monk.. \"Listen to him, man. You think that you are aiding us, and yet we are facing the ruin of the city. This man—a man of God, as you say—has told us what must be done if we are to be spared, and he reminds us that God is not bought with empty prayers, but by firm action, showing the determination of our faith in Him.\" \"Of course,\" Belisarius said. \"And those outside the gates are convinced that God will approve the stealing of food to save the lives of children, or the killing of another man in order to get passage on a ship to Constantinople.\" He got slowly to his feet. \"I cannot spare the troops to do as you wish. Tomorrow I ride to Roma myself, to find out how severe the trouble is, how many have fled and what defenses remain there.\" The oldest man crossed his arms and looked outraged. \"How can you do this?\" he demanded. \"I have more responsibilities than this place alone,\" said the General with less accommodation than he had shown before. \"The Emperor has entrusted all of Italy to my care, and expects that I will do all that I can to save all of it from the invasion of Totila. I must answer to Justinian and God, as you answer to your city and your families. Therefore, much as I would want to spare your city or any city misfortune, I must do as I am commanded. I leave for Roma in the morning. Those of my men I leave behind are mandated to do what they can to aid in the transport of Romans to safe ports, and that much they will do. Beyond that, you must look to your own resources. I will fail my mandate if I permit your concerns to override all that has been entrusted to me.\" The monk raised his hand, making a gesture against the evil eye. \"You are a tool of the forces of Hell, not of the Emperor.\" Belisarius had been cursed by those more expert than this man, but he still disliked the feelings it awakened in him. \"I am no one\u0027s tool, good monk. I am the Emperor\u0027s General in Italy and will remain so for as long as he honors me with the position.\" \"You will fall,\" said the monk with deep satisfaction. \"That is for God and Justinian to determine,\" said Belisarius with a faint smile. \"I will authorize two of my Captains to do what they can to aid in controlling the people coming through the city, and if you wish, I will give them permission to deal with any disruptions in the most direct way possible.\" He saw the faint approval in the men\u0027s eyes and went on to warn them. \"Take care. You have had near-riots here for the last several days, and now there is no doubt that these Romans will need all the aid they can get or take. If you are too stringent with them, you may lose all that you seek to preserve through your rules and limitations.\" The monk lowered his eyes. \"We submit to the will of God.\" \"Once you have troops to protect you,\" said Belisarius. \"And you, proud man, you are fast coming to a time when all your might and all your battles and all your honor will avail you nothing.\" The monk glowered at the General. \"The Emperor listens to other voices than yours. Never forget that.\" \"He listens to his wife after God,\" said Belisarius, not adding that Theodora was a close friend of his Antonina; as long as the two women were close friends, Belisarius knew that his position was secure. \"If a man is led by a woman, he makes his own fall, as did Adam,\" said the man with the darkest beard. \"It is known that these women have given themselves more to the service of Satan than of God.\" \"Do not let the Emperor hear you say such things,\" suggested Belisarius. \"He says that the words of a virtuous woman are more worthy than the preaching of fools. He has gained much from his wise Empress.\" It was apparent that none of the men believed this, and Belisarius was too tired to pursue the matter any further. The tallest of the delegation, a man who had remained stubbornly silent, finally said, \"How many troops will you leave here, General?\" \"I can leave no more than two hundred foot soldiers and fifty cavalry. The rest must follow me to Roma before midday,\" he said, welcoming this apparent understanding from one of the men of Neapolis. \"I will be certain that the instructions are clear to these troops. You may choose one of your number to work with the men I leave behind, and that will in turn give you the opportunity to arrange the defenses you have in whatever way most suits your purposes.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-2.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
