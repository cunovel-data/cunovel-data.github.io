You must see that.\" She had no anger in her tone, and no hint of condemnation. \"You are a good and sensible person, and you have loyalty. These are very worthwhile and I am pleased to have someone in my household with your virtues, but if you cannot tell me what I need to know, then something will have to be arranged, something neither of us would like.\" From her manner, it appeared that Olivia was discussing the arrangements of furniture in a room or the pattern of a garden\u0027s flowers instead of a threat against her life.\n \"I mustn\u0027t tell you anything. They will not spare you if I do, and they will do terrible things to me.\" She put her knuckles against her teeth.\n \"Terrible things. They must be desperate, these unknown men.\" She glanced quickly at Niklos.\n \"They are very powerful,\" Zejhil admitted reluctantly. \"They insisted.\"\n \"And you are not in a position to resist them, are you?\" Olivia straightened up. \"And you are convinced that there is nothing I can do to prevent them taking action against you.\"\n \"You are a foreign woman,\" Zejhil said in a small voice.\n \"So are you,\" she pointed out. \"Or is that what you mean? that I am as much at their mercy as a slave is?\"\n Niklos snorted. \"More fools they.\"\n \"Hush, my friend,\" Olivia admonished him softly. \"Zejhil, do you think that these men are trying to be rid of me?\"\n \"One way or another,\" the slave admitted. \"Oh, mistress, I didn\u0027t want to do anything to help them. I didn\u0027t. I told them that they would do better asking someone else, but they were persistent and they said that if I did not help them, then the officers of the Censor would come here and you would be found to have possessions that are forbidden, and then you would be deprived of your house and the things that you own—\"\n \"But if I conveniently died, that would make it possible for the household to be without taint, or something of the sort,\" Olivia finished for her. \"They are doing this for a reason, and not simply because I am Roman.\"\n \"They think that you are aiding Belisarius. They insisted that I tell them of every visit he has made here, and what transpired during his visit.\" Now that she was speaking the worst of the fear was gone from her eyes. \"I told them that I would do everything they required, just so that they would not do… what they threatened to do.\"\n \"If they harmed my slave in any way whatever,\" Olivia said and there was steel in her words, \"they would answer for it, in law and in other ways.\"\n \"It isn\u0027t so simple,\" Zejhil objected. \"They knew I had been watching the staff for you, and they knew that I reported to you, and that meant that they had others telling them what I was doing.\"\n \"Yes, that much is obvious.\" Niklos had come nearer and was watching Zejhil with curiosity. \"What makes you speak now? Are you hoping to balance favor against favor until you find the best price?\"\n \"Niklos, for the love you bear me, stop it.\" Olivia\u0027s gaze rested on him and it appeared to calm him, for he fell silent, but without the ill-contained fury he had shown before. \"Do you have any notion as to who among my slaves is working for the Censor? And it is the Censor, isn\u0027t it?\" This last was addressed not to Niklos but to Zejhil.\n \"I never said that!\" Zejhil shrieked.\n \"It had to be someone high in government and by the sound of it someone who dislikes and distrusts Belisarius. Either the Emperor himself—which is very unlikely—or one of his courtiers had to be responsible. The courtier who has been most consistent in his actions against Belisarius is the Censor, who has no reason to trust me or anything of mine.\" She nodded as if to remind herself of her thoughts. \"I\u0027ve wondered if we would have trouble because of him, but I never thought it would be so extreme.\"\n \"Olivia,\" said Niklos in a warning tone.\n \"I am safe saying these things,\" she told him. \"Zejhil is not going to give me away. Are you?\"\n Zejhil was now sitting cross-legged on the floor, her back against the wall. She shook her head slowly. \"I will have to tell them something.\"\n \"So you will.\" Olivia rubbed her face with her fingertips. \"You will have to make them believe that you completed your task and that there is poison in the spice chest. That must be the start.\" She sighed. \"And then, if you are willing, find out what they are trying to prove. I wish I knew what I had done to place myself in such jeopardy.\"\n \"It may be nothing more than your friendship for Belisarius,\" suggested Niklos.\n \"Possibly, but it may also be more.\" Olivia stared down at her linked hands. \"And in any case, we must find a way to warn Belisarius about this. He knows of other actions, but he does not know how far the machinations extend.\" Once again she looked down at Zejhil. \"What did they threaten to do to you?\"\n \"I… I can\u0027t tell you.\" The Tartar slave was appalled.\n \"Of course you can.\" Olivia watched her. \"Undoubtedly rape. But what else?\"\n Zejhil shook her head, mute again.\n \"For the names of your ancestors, girl!\" Niklos burst out. \"Tell your mistress. She can do nothing if you will not let her. Tell her!\"\n \"Niklos, don\u0027t hector her.\" Olivia waited, then said in a soft voice, \"If you are frightened, I don\u0027t blame you. Only a fool is not frightened by real danger. But you need not be paralyzed by your fear. You can act against it.\" She remained still a short time, then sighed once more and got up. \"Very well.\"\n \"They said they would rape me with swords and cut out my vitals and leave me in the market for the curs to eat. They would make sure I was alive.\" She said it quickly, as if by getting the words out swiftly their impact would lessen.\n \"How charming,\" Olivia said bitterly.\n \"They would. They are that sort.\" Zejhil got to her feet. \"I was supposed to put the poison in the sweet spices, so that you would get a little of it every day. That way poison would not be suspected until it was too late. Even if you had someone sample your food, it would not prevent your death.\"\n To Zejhil\u0027s surprise, Olivia chuckled. \"Then I will have to give them some reason to think the plot was discovered without compromising you.\" She shook her head. \"Slow poison. In food. Magna Mater, I\u0027m glad I\u0027ve found out about this.\"\n Niklos grinned briefly. \"In the food.\"\n Zejhil was baffled, but could not bring herself to speak.\n Olivia answered for her. \"You must understand, Zejhil, that I have… a rare condition that requires I… limit my diet severely. If the Censor expects me to succumb to poisoned spices, he would wait a very long time. So, perhaps, it might be best to make it appear that the poison was discovered, but not the poisoner. Let me think about it awhile.\"\n \"They will want some results,\" Niklos warned.\n \"And I suppose they will have some,\" said Olivia. \"But this will take careful planning. I will have to think about what must be done, and then be certain that…\" The words trailed off. \"If Zejhil was given poison, who knows what the other slaves being used have been given or offered. Niklos, I want you to sleep outside my door at night.\"\n \"I will,\" he promised her.\n \"And Zejhil, I want you to listen more closely than ever to what you hear.\" She scowled. \"Why do they want to be rid of me; it keeps coming back to that.\"\n Zejhil stood with her head down. \"I know I must be punished for what I did. I accept that. But do not punish me in front of the others.\"\n \"Punish you?\" repeated Olivia, startled. \"Oh, for the poison, do you mean? Yes, I imagine something ought to be done.\"\n \"I\u0027ll get the whips,\" Niklos said without emotion.\n \"Don\u0027t be silly,\" Olivia told him. \"For punishment, I will insist that you replace Pentheus as the night keeper. I will expect you to patrol the house and the garden all through the night, and during the day, I want you to clean the reception rooms and the vestibule, starting with scrubbing the floors. Every day. Until I tell you otherwise. Is that clear?\"\n \"It is a light punishment,\" said Zejhil.\n \"Say that when ten days have gone by and I might agree.\" She stared at the door. \"You are to return to your quarters now and remain there. You will have no meal this evening.\" She waited while Zejhil made a deep reverence, then motioned to Niklos to let her out of the room.\n When Zejhil was gone, Niklos said, \"You did give her light punishment.\"\n \"Possibly. I am giving the agents of the Censor plenty of opportunity to approach her. If she cleans the vestibule, they can find her during the day, and if she is the night keeper, they can try after dark. And then, old friend, we can find out what it is they\u0027re really after.\" She paced the length of the room. \"For some reason, they\u0027re becoming desperate.\"\n \"And you are becoming lax,\" Niklos countered.\n \"If we weren\u0027t strangers here, I might do this another way. But we are here on sufferance, and they are already seeking reasons to be rid of us. I would prefer to be free of suspicion, but if that isn\u0027t possible, then—\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-52.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
