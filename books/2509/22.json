A man curious about such matters would correctly address your senior male relative, or, barring that, your sponsor. That way you need not be hampered by these considerations, which are not at all appropriate to you.\"\\n\\n \"Simply because I\u0027m a woman?\" Olivia marveled.\\n\\n \"It saves us all from much that is unpleasant.\" It was clear that Antonina did not intend to discuss the matter further.\\n\\n Olivia was not willing to concede her position quite yet. \"I see; a woman need not bother herself about her money or property. She need not know how much of either she has—which, in fact she does not have because she is not permitted to control it—or what is being done with it. There was a time in Roma, not so very long ago, that such things would be grounds for a lawsuit.\"\\n\\n Antonina sighed. \"Perhaps, in those days before the Church established itself, such protections were required. But no man who has confessed himself a Christian would profit from the labor of others, or abuse the trust of his—\"\\n\\n \"Inferiors,\" Olivia interrupted her. \"No wonder you have rescinded the rights of your slaves, since you have reduced your females to bonded servants.\" She held up her hands in mock submission. \"It will take time for me to learn these things. For a little while, you must be content to have me chafe at the bit.\"\\n\\n \"You worry for no purpose,\" said Antonina and would have gone on, but there was a discreet rap on the entrance to her box. \"Who is there?\"\\n\\n \"Themistokles,\" came the answer, and since Olivia assumed it was not the ancient Athenian, she looked to her hostess.\\n\\n \"Who is this person?\"\\n\\n \"The Empress\u0027 chief eunuch,\" said Antonina. She motioned to her two slaves flanking the door to open it. \"God send you great blessings,\" she greeted the huge man who stepped into the box.\\n\\n \"God has blessed me already, more than ever I deserved.\" His voice was high and sweet and very strong. His face, almost completely unlined, gave no indication of his age, but there was a slight tracing of gray in his auburn curls. He made a deep reverence to Antonina and then to Olivia. \"August lady, great lady,\" he said elegantly. \"It is my privilege to serve the most serene and elevated Empress Theodora, and she has mandated that I come here to ask that you bear her company for an hour while the races are conducted.\"\\n\\n It was a formal invitation, and as such would offer no delay in being accepted. Antonina inclined her head. \"It is a great honor that so majestic a lady should deign to accept the simple company of women such as we are. We are all alacrity to attend her.\" She had risen as she spoke, and she signaled to Pope Demosthenes. \"If it would not distress you to remain here, I will ask it of you.\"\\n\\n \"It would give me time to think,\" said the old pope, and he stared at the eunuch. \"I petition heaven to bless your mistress every day of my life, and I recount her praises every night.\"\\n\\n \"She is humbly grateful,\" said Themistokles. He indicated the open doorway. \"August lady? Great lady? if you will come with me?\"\\n\\n Antonina complied at once and gestured to Olivia to hasten when it appeared that the Roman woman was not going to leave the box at once. \"We are expected, Olivia,\" Antonina told her sharply.\\n\\n \"I was only trying to gather one or two cushions,\" Olivia protested, doing her best not to sound sharp.\\n\\n The crowd started to chant loudly, the rhythm rolling and pronounced, more compelling than any of the words they used.\\n\\n \"It appears that the chestnuts are overtaking the bays,\" said Themistokles and was puzzled when Antonina and Olivia exchanged quick glances. \"There are those who risked too much money on the event.\"\\n\\n \"How fortunate that women are not permitted to gamble,\" said Olivia with a submissive sweetness that was completely foreign to her nature.\\n\\n The sarcasm was lost entirely on the eunuch who only stood aside to allow Antonina and Olivia to step into the narrow hallway so that he could lead them to the Imperial box.\\n\\n The passage was guarded at intervals by officers in the chain-ornamented loricae of the Guard. The air reeked of fish and cooking lamb and humanity. There was a hint of the tang of horses as well, but it was not noticeable in all the rest. The noise made the narrow hallway echo and moan like an enormous seashell held to the ear.\\n\\n \"What does the Empress want of us?\" Olivia could not resist asking Belisarius\u0027 wife.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. She did not inform me that she would want my company during the races, which is most unusual for her. I saw her only yesterday; I should have thought that she might then have said something to me. Such is her habit, you see.\"\\n\\n Olivia was well-aware of Antonina\u0027s favored status with Theodora, but she checked the pointed observation that rose to her tongue. \"It might be news from your husband.\"\\n\\n \"General Belisarius has made arrangements for me to receive my messages directly from him through the good work of his officers, and therefore it is not likely that Theodora would have any information that I lack. However, yes, there may be news of the campaign that has not yet reached me. That\u0027s very likely the case.\" Her unruffled calm reasserted itself and she moved more easily, her confidence apparent in every aspect of her bearing.\\n\\n The Imperial box was more than twice the size of the one that Antonina occupied. It was all of pale green marble with the accents in gold. There were several marble chairs and three less imposing wooden chairs provided for those Theodora or Justinian summoned to the box. Theodora herself, resplendent in her jewels and gaudy silk, smiled at the reverence the two women offered her, then motioned to Themistokles. \"See that refreshment is provided for my guests.\"\\n\\n \"How kind of you,\" Antonina enthused. \"I was saying to Olivia that you provide the most tempting food for those you entertain.\"\\n\\n \"And I,\" Olivia said, doing her best to be diffident, \"said that I almost envied Antonina the delight of your table, and could curse my fortune that made my liver so easily upset that I dare not eat in the company of others for fear I will become ill.\"\\n\\n \"Ill?\" repeated Theodora, who was clearly not used to being refused, no matter how politely.\\n\\n Olivia hesitated, trying to recall all the good advice her best and kindest lover had offered her over the centuries. He had been able to refuse food and drink so gracefully that those offering had been complimented. Olivia wished now that she could bring some of those elegant phrases to mind. \"Most serene Empress,\" she began, \"I am not yet as versed in your ways, or in your language, that I can explain to you what anguish I feel. You have provided an honor I could not have anticipated; to have to limit my participation galls me, yet it would be far worse if I was forced to withdraw from here because I could not remain without disgracing myself.\"\\n\\n \"How unfortunate,\" said Theodora, her dark eyes raking over Olivia mercilessly. \"I am not used to such… intolerances.\"\\n\\n \"Then you are most fortunate, and I would thank God from my knees every hour if I could say the same thing. I pray that you never learn what I have had to learn, majestic lady.\" Flattery, especially such overstated and obvious flattery, appalled Olivia, but she could read a degree of approval in Theodora\u0027s narrow face.\\n\\n \"You must seek out an Egyptian physician; perhaps there is some medicament you have not yet encountered.\" She signaled to three of the young male slaves—eunuchs, also, by the look of them—to bring her meal. \"Antonina,\" she said, some of her formality relaxing, \"I decided that I did not want to pass the afternoon without company, and when I recalled that you would be here, I thought that you and your guest might be willing to spend your time here with me.\"\\n\\n \"We are overcome, Theodora,\" said Antonina, taking on a cozy manner. \"When you made no mention of the races the other day, I naturally supposed you would have other plans for the races.\"\\n\\n \"There were others who my beloved and exalted husband wished to attend, but it has turned out otherwise, and they are all occupied with matters of state.\" She smiled as low tables were brought.\\n\\n Below them, the chestnut team swept past the winning marker more than six lengths ahead of the bays. The crowd roared and the sound of feet thumping the stands made all conversation impossible for a short while. Theodora contented herself with watching her slaves offer food and drink to Antonina.\\n\\n Finally the bray of the buccinae quieted the stands and the Captain of the City Guard presented the winner with a brass wreath made to resemble large hedge roses with exaggerated thorns.\\n\\n \"The people like these displays,\" said Theodora. \"They see themselves winning. And when those they bet for lose, then it is a defeat that costs little more than the price of what was bet.\" She smiled at Olivia. \"I understand that since these wars began, there has been little racing in Roma.\"\\n\\n \"There has been little everything in Roma,\" Olivia corrected her quietly.\\n\\n \"That is unfortunate,\" said Theodora. \"And surely you must be overjoyed to see racing again.\"\\n\\n \"It makes me homesick,\" she told Theodora. \"Long ago, of course, we had much more than horse racing in Roma. The Ludi Maximi were marvels that no one has equaled. Thousands participated, and they went on for three or four days.\" Her hazel eyes darkened with memory. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-22.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \\n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
