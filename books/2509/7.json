Olivia found herself longing for the mosaics of her youth. Where, amid this vehement and abstracted suffering, was one dolphin, one dog worrying a bone, one cherub dangling a flute or a wine cup? These were the scenes she recalled most affectionately from those long-ago days when she grew up. In her father\u0027s villa there was one wall showing Jupiter turning into a bull, with a buxom Europa waiting for her lover with more enthusiasm than awe. There had been two swineherds in the corner of the fresco, off to the lower right-hand corner. They had been sharing a wineskin and bread, and they idly watched the transformation. One of them was forever in the act of tossing a scrap to a tabby cat. There had been nothing so everyday, so human in the art Olivia had seen here in Byzantium; even in Roma now, the touches she loved were disappearing.\n \"Great lady?\" repeated the eunuch, who had returned.\n Olivia looked up sharply. \"Oh; excuse me. These pictures—\" She indicated the walls.\n \"Antonina is a woman of much piety, and this is only the outward sign of it,\" said the eunuch, apparently favorably impressed by Olivia\u0027s interest. \"If you will condescend to follow me, I will bring you to Antonina.\"\n \"Thank you,\" said Olivia, falling into step behind the slave.\n \"You are not the only great lady to visit Antonina today,\" said the eunuch. His voice was low and mature: he had been emasculated after manhood. Because he had run to fat it was hard to say if he had ever been handsome, but there was a sweetness to his round face that could once have been more attractive than it was safe for a slave to be.\n \"What is your name, slave?\" asked Olivia.\n \"I am Arius,\" he told her, apparently surprised at the question.\n \"In Roma, I always wanted to know the names of those who did me service so that I would be able to leave some token of my appreciation for good service,\" she said, remembering how many slaves had once been able eventually to buy their freedom with those accumulated tokens. Olivia was still distressed that those laws had been changed.\n \"No token is necessary. This is Konstantinoupolis, great lady, not Roma, and here we give thanks to God, not to those whose place it is to serve.\" He had led the way down a long hall and now stopped at two tall doors. \"These are the reception apartments of the august lady Antonina.\"\n \"I am looking forward to the honor of meeting her,\" said Olivia, doing her best not to be impatient.\n Arius made his reverence as he opened the door. It was a graceful gesture, as formal and unnatural as the attitudes of the figures in the ikons that flanked the doors. \"August lady, this is the great lady Olivia,\" said the eunuch before he stepped aside to let Olivia enter.\n Antonina was seated on a silk-covered couch; she was a magnificent woman, all stark contrasts. Her hair, black as onyx, had two white streaks that only served to make the dark more impressive. Her eyes were large, rimmed with heavy lashes and accented by curving dark brows. Her skin was the lightest shade of peach that Olivia had ever seen. Her clothes were silken, the paenula so extensive that it surrounded and engulfed her in vast folds of shimmering red. At her shoulder, her tablion was the size of the palm of her hand, encrusted with garnets and gold. \"Welcome to my husband\u0027s house,\" she said, not rising.\n Olivia smiled without warmth. \"I am pleased to bring you his greetings and remembrances,\" she said, hoping that she had come close to the proper formula.\n \"And this\"—she indicated the other woman in the room—\"is Eugenia. She is the widow of Katalinus Hyakinthos, who was the bastard of Elezaros.\" This name was apparently supposed to mean something to Olivia, and Antonina waited for her response.\n \"There was a… naval commander, wasn\u0027t there?\" She hoped that her memory was correct; she sensed that neither woman would be forgiving of an error.\n \"My husband\u0027s father, yes. They were killed in the same storm.\" She was not as tall as Antonina, nor quite as richly dressed. Her body was rounder and softer, more yielding, and her posture was more inviting. She, too, wore an enormous paenula, hers of a deep sea-green shot with gold, and her tablion was not as large or as be jeweled as Antonina\u0027s.\n \"How unfortunate,\" said Olivia.\n \"My husband sends me word that you, too, are a widow.\" She pointed to another couch, making it clear she wished Olivia to sit there.\n \"For many years, yes,\" she answered candidly.\n \"Yet you are not ancient,\" said Antonina.\n \"I wear my years well,\" Olivia said.\n \"That may be fortunate,\" Antonina declared. \"Widows are not uncommon and it is not always the most simple thing to find them proper mates. There are men who prefer women who have never been married to those who have. I was fortunate, for my husband told me from the first that he was pleased that he had found me a widow, for that meant I knew men and I knew marriage. I was most pleased that he felt that way, and I told him then, as I have continued to tell him, that no woman can appreciate a marriage until her second one.\" She smiled, and it was clear she expected her two guests to smile as well.\n Realizing that this was likely to be more awkward than she had thought at first, Olivia said, \"That may be, and certainly I have no means to tell, but let me assure you, august lady—\"\n \"You must call me Antonina,\" she purred.\n \"You are all kindness,\" said Olivia, going on before she could be distracted. \"Let me assure you that I have not come to you with the hope that you will supply a husband upon request. I have had such experience of marriage that I am not in a hurry to resume my married state. For a time, I am content to be a widow, and if this does not exclude me from friendships and society, I will abide as I am.\" She folded her hands in her lap and gave what she hoped was a trusting and guileless look to her hostess.\n \"No woman has a distaste of marriage,\" Antonina said in a manner that would clearly tolerate no disputes.\n \"I have, I am afraid. My husband was a man of strange appetites which he imposed upon me and that has left me with a lack of trust of marriage.\" She regarded Eugenia, hoping she might find an ally. \"If your husband held you in respect and affection, then you have known two things I never had from my husband.\"\n \"It is not fitting to speak against the dead, let alone a dead husband,\" announced Antonina, but she relented. \"If what you say is true, then the Church failed you, for it is the responsibility of the priests to be certain that God\u0027s commands are obeyed on earth. As you are to be submissive to the will of your husband, so he is to give you care and comfort.\"\n Privately Olivia thought that the last characteristic she saw in Antonina was submission, but she made no comment about it. \"The priests… were not as apt to take a hand,\" she said, trusting that her vagueness would be seen as tact instead of the evasion it was.\n \"There are those who do not uphold the honor of their God as they ought,\" said Antonina, directing a hard glance at Eugenia. \"I have said that your priest was wrong in permitting you to travel to Cyprus without a guard to accompany you.\"\n \"He said that since there were others in the ship who were also visiting the shrine that it would be satisfactory,\" said Eugenia, clearly rehashing an old argument. \"My priest said that when the journey is a holy one, then it is necessary to leave all pomp behind in order to show humility in the proper manner.\" She smiled, her mouth turning up at the corners and making her look even more like a kitten than her angular face and pointed chin already did.\n \"Still, think of the insult if anything had occurred,\" Antonina persisted. \"It may be spiritually wise to make pilgrimages, but I do not believe that it is sensible to take such extreme risks.\"\n \"You have a General for a husband,\" said Olivia, deciding that she might as well discover as much as she could about what Antonina\u0027s opinions were since she would have to deal with them while she lived in Constantinople.\n \"Yes, and a very great man. He is filled with distinction and honor, and he does not use this for anything but his service to God and the Emperor.\" There was a faint regret in her words, as if Belisarius\u0027 integrity was a subtle disappointment to his spouse.\n Eugenia must also have been aware of the underlying lack of satisfaction in Antonina\u0027s voice, for she said, \"How it must please you to know that Belisarius is as stalwart as he is, and free from the taint of manipulation and intrigue that has compromised so many others.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-7.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
