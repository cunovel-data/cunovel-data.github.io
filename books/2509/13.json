He has consented to speak with you, bondsman of the Roman lady Clemens.\"\n \"I gather,\" said Taiko abruptly, \"that she\u0027s the widow everyone\u0027s talking about, the one who bought the house from Andros Trachi. They say that Antonina has entertained her three times since she arrived.\"\n \"That is so,\" said Niklos, a trifle taken aback by the man\u0027s behavior.\n \"She\u0027ll need a number of slaves to run that place, and from what I hear, she\u0027s made it even more elaborate than it was. Went and installed one of those heathenish Roman baths. The popes\u0027ll have something to say about that.\" He grinned once. \"They say she\u0027s rich.\"\n \"She is,\" said Niklos. \"My mistress has a large fortune.\"\n Where Pammez had laughed, Taiko guffawed. \"Fortune!\" he exclaimed when he could speak. \"A widow with a fortune.\"\n \"Why does this amuse you?\" demanded Niklos, who was growing indignant.\n Taiko bobbed his head twice and then spat. \"Well, I can\u0027t suppose you Romans understand that—though your name says you\u0027re Greek—and I\u0027ll explain it, but undoubtedly Antonina has already made this clear to your Roman lady. You speak as if she has money and property of her own, which belong directly and only to her. I guess they might do things that way in Roma, being so wild there. But here we are more in accord with the teachings of scripture, and we do not let women fend for themselves. Your Roman widow will have to have someone to manage her affairs for her, to purchase slaves and provide her with the housing she requires.\"\n \"What do you mean?\" asked Niklos.\n \"I hear that Belisarius himself arranged for the house, and that\u0027s a great honor for her, but now that she\u0027s here, she\u0027ll need a sponsor, preferably a pope since she\u0027s a widow and has no father or brother living here. These are the ones who will purchase the slaves and see them installed.\" He motioned to Pammez. \"Go and get my scribe. We will need to take down her requirements. I am sure we can see that she is given provisional purchase until something more correct can be arranged. She\u0027ll need slaves to keep that house going.\"\n Pammez hastened to obey, making a deep reverence to his master as he left the room.\n \"Have a seat, bondsman,\" offered Taiko, and dropped onto a long couch. \"This might take time.\"\n \"Why must there be a sponsor?\" asked Niklos as he chose a square-backed chair.\n \"She\u0027s a woman. She is hardly in a position to know what is best to do.\" He smiled abruptly. \"Maybe the Roman women have had less guidance. It wouldn\u0027t be so unusual, given what the Romans have shown themselves to be. They\u0027ve permitted women to do far too many things for themselves, and look! the whole country is in disarray.\"\n Listening to Taiko, Niklos was distressed. No wonder there had been so many difficulties since their arrival. \"Why would it not be possible for Antonina to serve as sponsor in her husband\u0027s absence?\" He hoped he had got the words right.\n Taiko shook his head. \"You Romans have no notion, have you? If the august lady Antonina were not so well-placed, I would not be able to provide even these make-shift arrangements until a churchman had approved them, but with Antonina so much a friend of Theodora, I am certain that a few changes will be overlooked if they are not too obvious or left unresolved for too long.\" He signaled to his majordomo, indicating Niklos and himself. \"If you will bring us honeycakes and wine?\"\n At once Niklos held up his hand. \"If you are getting this for me, I must decline. It would not be proper for a Roman bondsman to take such hospitality, because it would insult your offer. I have not learned your ways yet and keep to my own.\"\n Taiko looked at Niklos, then shrugged. \"Romans. You are an odd lot.\"\n \"You are strange to us, as well,\" Niklos said, doing his best to make light of this observation. \"My mistress has said so hourly since we came here.\"\n \"Alone as she is, with no one to act for her and no man to guide her, it must be very sad for her. How many women can endure this without aid?\" He addressed the question more to the air than to Niklos. \"You are the closest thing she has to a man in this world, if what has been said is true, and a bondsman is hardly more than a slave.\" He took a deep breath and let it out explosively. \"I suppose that I must do all that I can to assist you in this dreadful circumstance.\"\n \"I would appreciate it,\" said Niklos, wishing that Taiko were making a joke, and aware that he was not.\n \"Excellent,\" said the slave-merchant. \"I will show you what is available for running a household like your mistress\u0027, and you will select as you see fit. I will of course be willing to accept any slave returned within two days. You may not be satisfied with a selection until you determine how the slave goes in the household. A man may deal with recalcitrant slaves by might and by his order, but women are not able to do this.\" He indicated Pammez. \"He will see that all the slaves you select are healthy, and if they are not you will be notified. We cannot assure you that every slave is Christian, and if this is a requirement, it may take more time to staff the household to your satisfaction. Is it necessary that your slaves be Christian? I have found that some women insist that they have Christian slaves only.\"\n \"My mistress is not so fussy. In Roma we have learned to…\"He could not think of the word for tolerate, and this annoyed him more than he wanted to admit. \"In Roma,\" he began again, \"there are many of different faiths.\"\n \"And the Bishop of Roma has said that Roma is the center of the faith,\" scoffed Taiko. \"How can anyone believe that if there is such chaos?\"\n \"The Bishop of Roma knows Romans,\" said Niklos. \"And so does my mistress.\"\n This time Taiko nodded sagely. \"Yes, I understand your meaning here, bondsman. You must accommodate your mistress, and you are correct in taking such an attitude, but here in Konstantinoupolis, you need not fear for your beliefs. We protect those who are sincere, unlike the reprehensible cowardice of the Bishop of Roma, who has fled his city when it is most in danger. No wonder the world has moved to this place.\"\n \"The invaders are always a problem,\" said Niklos, doing his best to appear submissive.\n \"Come, then,\" said Taiko, getting up suddenly. \"I will show you what I have to offer and I will tell you what the slaves will cost. You, in turn, may do as you wish in making your selection. I have a full list of the accomplishments, skills and the full records of the slaves from their previous owners.\"\n Niklos followed him, aware that this man might easily decide to be offended by his visitor, which would stop the negotiations for some time, and which would not be useful to Olivia. He kept his manner subdued and respectful as he entered the quarters at the rear of the house and stood while Taiko called out names.\n Finally there were fourteen men and women lined up for Niklos\u0027 inspection. They ranged in age from twelve or thirteen to near thirty. Five of them were at least partly Asian, including one woman called Zejhil who had been brought from beyond Vagarshapat. There were two Egyptians, and the rest were of mixed Greek and African blood.\n \"This will be enough for a short time. There is no gardener, and there are only three kitchen slaves, but if it is as you say and your mistress has few requirements in that area, then these will suffice until a proper sponsor can be established for your mistress,\" said Taiko in his most confident manner; he had done this many times before.\n \"If you are willing, I would like to see two more, the Briton and the fellow from Ptolemais. They have skills that would be of great use to my mistress, and she wishes to have these skills in her household at once.\" Again he was hampered by his lack of skill with Greek, but he continued as best he could. \"I will inform my mistress of the aid you have given me.\"\n \"That\u0027s good to know. All right—the Briton and the Ptolemaisi.\" He clapped his hands and called out two more names. As the slaves came forward, he addressed them all. \"You have been selected for the household of the Roman lady Olivia Clemens. She will have two days to install you, and if you do not give satisfaction, she will return you to me, and I will deal with you accordingly. You are to be loyal and dutiful to her. God has given you your station in life and it is for you to bow your head to your fate.\"\n Most of the slaves made the sign of protection, but a few said nothing and remained still.\n \"You are to go with this bondsman, who will tell you what is required of you. Any deviation from his orders will be told to me and it will be part of your record. If you wish to live well, you will see that your record is kept clear of questions. Am I understandable to everyone?\"\n The Briton asked in halting Greek with a strong accent, \"If we are not… good speakers, what then?\"\n Niklos answered before Taiko could. \"My mistress, as this merchant has said, is Roman. She will do what she can to make all of you know what she says. And though I am Greek, I have lived most of my life in Roma, so my speech is not very good in Greek.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-13.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
