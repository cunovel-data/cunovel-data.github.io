In the meantime, if you find any other villas that are promising, and that have not been the headquarters for the army, make a note of them. I think that we might be fortunate if we can keep from becoming too greedy, or taking too much from one place. We must loot with discrimination.\" He belched laughter at his own humor. \"We are not looting,\" said Pope Sylvestros. \"No? What would you call it?\" He gave the pope a friendly thump on the shoulder. \"Conversion? Donation?\" This time he did not laugh. \"Whatever hypocritical reason you have, embrace it if it salves your conscience. And continue to find likely sites for our activities.\" Suddenly he lunged to his feet and battered open the nearest door. Beyond the landlord stood, his stained mantele caught in his hands, his face guilty. \"Well, well, well, what goes on here?\" \"Nothing, Captain. Nothing. I was only curious to know if you had finished your business so that I could resume business.\" \"For only the two of us? Your tavern isn\u0027t very popular these days. Could it be that you were hoping to augment your earnings by applying for a reward as an informant?\" \"Never!\" the landlord said stoutly as his ruddy face turned hideously pale. \"Ah!\" Ghornan was shorter than the landlord, and not as stout, but he was strong as the trunk of an oak tree, and he flung the man across the room with less effort than most would have thought possible. \"You craven. You don\u0027t even lie well.\" He strode over to the counter and helped himself to another cup of wine. As he drank, he regarded the landlord, saying at his most affable, \"You know, I once caught one of my sailors trying to sell off part of my cargo. I took some of the rope from the sails and I had it soaked in pitch, and then I stuffed it down his gullet and up his ass. It burned quite a while.\" The landlord was gulping for air, his eyes wild with terror. \"I swear, Captain, by the Mother of God, that I never intended to do—\" \"I think,\" Ghornan went on as if he had not heard the landlord, \"that this time I might wrap the rope around the body a couple of times, just to speed things up.\" The landlord scrambled to his feet. \"You would never do such a thing, not with a priest to watch you.\" \"What do you think this pope would do? How could he stop me if I decided to act?\" He glanced from the landlord to Pope Sylvestros and back again. \"How could he stop me?\" With a choking cry, the landlord bolted from the room. Pope Sylvestros had risen. \"He will inform against us.\" \"Oh, no he won\u0027t. I have four crewmen waiting outside; they\u0027ll catch him for us. I\u0027ll tend to him later.\" He came and sat back down opposite the pope. \"What… what will you do to him?\" he asked uncertainly. \"Do you really want me to tell you?\" was the sardonic response. When Pope Sylvestros faltered, Ghornan picked up the pages from the table. \"Come. Let\u0027s decide what we\u0027re going to take this time.\" Numbly Pope Sylvestros nodded and turned his mind away from the landlord\u0027s fate to the prospect of possible riches. Text of an announcement sent throughout the Byzantine Empire. To all subjects, citizens, and slaves of the Emperor Justinian; your attention, prayers, and devotions are required to mourn the death of the Empress Theodora, who passed from worldly travail into bliss on the feast day of Saint Felix of Nola, after enduring with fortitude the ravages of disease. Coming so soon after the Feast of the Nativity, her death in this world is seen as especially blessed and more than silences the calumnies that have been spoken of her while she lived and grew in grace as the beloved wife of Emperor Justinian. Any person so lost to faith and charity who believes and repeats all or any part of the lies that have been spread about the virtuous Empress Theodora risks his body in this life and his soul in the next. Empress Theodora rose from her obscure beginnings through her innate kindness and goodness, and it was God\u0027s approval that brought her to the throne and bed of the Emperor Justinian. Anyone discovered defaming the memory of this most blessed Empress will face the full weight of civil and ecclesiastical justice, and the only mercy that will avail so malignant a person then will be the Mercy of God. For one year the Byzantine Empire will mourn for Empress Theodora. Those who do not observe this period will come under rigorous scrutiny. By the order of Kimon Athanatadies Court Censor at the behest of the Emperor of Byzantion, Justinian I PART II Drosos Text of a letter from Antonina to her husband Belisarius. To my esteemed and beloved husband on the Eve of Good Friday, hail and embraces. With Theodora dead, there is nothing more I can do on your behalf with Justinian. He has refused to receive either me or those officers—notably Drosos and Chrysanthos—who have continued to support you, and in fact it appears that their constancy has fed his suspicions that you are gathering men around you for the purpose of overthrowing him and assuming the throne yourself. If you have any such plan, my husband, this is the time to act, for I would be astonished if you were permitted to remain in Italy until the end of Spring, given the Emperor\u0027s current state of mind. While you have never confided such ambitions to me, I would certainly support you in any advancement or endeavor you wish to undertake, and doubtless you have as worthy a claim to leadership as has Justinian. You have always been loyal, and I do not mean to impugn your loyalty, but there have been those in the past who have professed themselves loyal to the Empire and not to the Emperor. If this is truly the case with you, you are now at that time when action is necessary or you will lose the day and the chance you seek, should you seek it at all. I am gratified, naturally, that you depend on my affection for your strength, and your avowal of love and continuing passion is most flattering to a woman of my age, but for the moment, let us turn our attention to more pressing matters. There will be time enough later for tenderness and kisses. Now we must take care to minimize the damage that has been done so that you do not lose all credibility at court and thereby endanger yourself even more than is currently the case. You would do well to send word to all your officers, current and former, that you are devoted to the Emperor and his vision of a New Roma. That is essential if you are not to be implicated in treason before the year is over. When you have done that, I suggest that you do your utmost to expand the area you control in Italy and show your zeal when you do. This may not do much in the long run, and it could strain your supplies and men again, but you must believe me: Justinian demands a victory or he will hold you personally responsible. Once that happens your time in his good graces is over entirely. Let me tell you now that you are being foolish to plan to live quietly until the worst of this is past. You must not entertain such thoughts even for a moment. Without success and a great display of military prowess, all the lies that have been told of you will be accepted as true and you will be powerless indeed. If Justinian orders you back to Konstantinoupolis, you may be sure that it is to keep watch over you and to undermine any base of power you may have established. Yes, you may be confident that my care and affection continues unabated no matter what is thought of you. I would be a poor wife if I allowed anything else to color my conduct. If you are exiled, then it is fitting that I accept exile with you, or enter the Church, which I do not intend to do. I know that you will always be a good husband to me, and will never disgrace our union in any way. That, however, is not sufficient after all you have done for the Empire and the ungrateful Emperor who has chosen to assuage his grief for his beloved wife through measures even more stringent than ones he has taken previously. It is not wise to observe this, perhaps, but there is a severity in Justinian\u0027s nature that without Theodora\u0027s presence might prove to be a trial to us all. He is a demanding man and what he requires of his people is more extensive than most of them realize. Without any influence with the Emperor, you are the one he is going to vent his feelings upon, and it is time to prepare, one way or another, for that day. You have an opportunity granted to few. It is for you to act or to fail now, not in some later time when the issues are clearer, for then you will not have access to the men and supplies that are around you now. Do not reject my suggestions out of hand, my husband. They are made for love of you and the Empire. By my own hand Antonina 1 It was a contrived meeting, one that Simones had taken great pains to make appear both accidental and fortuitous. The fish market was so busy that everyone elbowed and shouted and shoved in an effort to reach the stalls where the various fishermen had set up slabs to show their catch. In such a setting, two important household slaves might expect to find each other trying to purchase the same sole. \"You are the majordomo to the Roman widow, aren\u0027t you?\" asked Simones, feigning doubt.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-34.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
