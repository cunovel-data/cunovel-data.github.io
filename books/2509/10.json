{"id":107697,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\"The Emperor honors me,\" said Belisarius as soon as he did not have to shout to be heard. There were now more than ten men in the courtyard, all gathered near the messenger. \"The Emperor tends to all those who are his subjects,\" said the messenger, sounding more fatigued than devoted. \"And I am to have words from him. I thank him and I thank God for this distinction.\" Belisarius longed to reach up and take the scroll from the man, but that would be intolerable to the man and to Justinian, so he waited until the slave finally arrived with a suitable stool so that the man could dismount in complete safety and not risk dropping the scroll he carried. Once that ceremony had been observed, Belisarius took the scroll and retired to the dining room that now served as the officers\u0027 chapel. He broke the seals in the presence of his officers and the two priests who accompanied them, and then read the scroll. \"Leonidas, Drosos, Savas, Hipparchos, Omerion, you are all being distinguished by the Emperor Justinian, who is ever the champion of God and his people. You are ordered to return to Constantinople in forty days, at which time you are to tender a complete and unbiased report of what has taken place here in Italy. Furthermore, each of you is instructed to keep daily records from now until your time of departure, and to tell no one of the contents of those records until such time as the Imperial Censor shall examine them for the August Majesty.\" He sighed; such orders did not bode well. The five officers all accepted their orders with enthusiasm, but Drosos tried to catch his General\u0027s eye as he did. \"I am required to make a catalogue of misdeeds of our soldiers here in Italy and see that it is placed in the files of the Imperial Censor, along with any record of punishment meted out for the action of the soldiers.\" That would cause more rancor than the daily reports, he knew, but he would not dispute a direct order from Justinian. \"If there are goods, chattels and other properties to be shipped back to Constantinople, the messenger must be informed so that proper allocation of space and slaves may be made. The messenger has the Emperor\u0027s mandate to see all of you are treated with greatest respect and attention, and you are assured that nothing of value need be discarded or left behind unless you would rather not be hampered by the material, in which case access to markets in Italy will be guaranteed by Justinian.\" He could not imagine how the Emperor could make such promises, and having made them, fulfill them, but he knew better than to question what Justinian said and did. He held out the scroll to the messenger. \"You have witnessed the notification of these officers. Is there anything more I need do while you are in my presence?\" \"No, General, not at the moment,\" said the messenger, who looked overcome with fatigue now that his actual duties had been discharged. \"Very well. You will be escorted to quarters here, if that is your wish, although we are about to move out. We can also arrange for you to travel in a litter or—\" All his life since he had become a soldier Belisarius had taken care to treat messengers well; they were far too important to ignore simply because they did no fighting. \"Any provision you make, General, will be acceptable. I am tired, but…\"He finished the thought with a shrug. \"Then we will order a litter, so that you may rest and not have to be jostled about on a horse.\" He clapped his hands and was gratified when one of the household slaves hurried up. \"This man needs food, and while he is eating, order a litter made ready for him, so that he can travel when we leave.\" He realized that in giving that order he had just pushed back their departure the better part of an hour, but he could think of no alternative. \"General?\" Leonidas asked. \"Yes?\" He waited while the young Captain ordered his thoughts. \"What is it?\" \"How long do you think we will be here? Not this place, but in the vicinity of Roma?\" \"That is hard to say, but since you are returning to Constantinople, there is no reason for you to be concerned about the army in Italy.\" He smiled to show that he had no opinions on the matter one way or the other. \"But what will this do to the plans we have been following?\" It was a question they all wanted to ask but had hesitated to bring to Belisarius\u0027 attention, for this change in officers would seriously alter the strength of his forces. \"That,\" Belisarius said slowly, \"will depend on what Justinian decides to do in regard to our men here. If he sends the troops he has said that he would, we will be able to maintain our positions; if he does not send the troops and supplies, or if they are not sent in time, then the situation becomes a great deal more grave. As you are aware, we are not at the advantage now, and to recover it will take time and real effort.\" \"And the troops?\" asked Drosos. \"If we have seasoned troops, good Roman and Greek fighters, we will be more likely to succeed than if the men are new to war or are from those peoples who delight in pillage. Some of the Italians are already abused by our men, and they resent this. If we continue in the same manner, then any support we might hope for will be lost.\" He shook his head once. \"We must strive to carry out the orders of the Emperor.\" \"How?\" was the reasonable question Drosos put forth for all of them. \"Ah, if I knew that, I would be one with the Saints and God. We will pray that if there can be victory, we will be shown the way to achieve it.\" He saw an odd look on the messenger\u0027s face, and then the man was following the slave into the villa. \"I say these orders bode ill for our campaign,\" announced Omerion, who was lean and tough as a ship\u0027s mast. \"That may be, but keep such thoughts to yourself, for your own protection,\" said Belisarius. \"There are those in Constantinople who would turn your sentiments to your disadvantage; the court is not the army. Here we may gossip, but there a few unguarded words can endanger your life.\" He gave a signal. \"All right. Everyone back to work. Assemble in front of the walls before midday and we will start then.\" That would be much later than he would have wished, but there was no chance now to move up their leaving. Cursing softly, Belisarius started away toward the stables, his attention more on the messenger than on the journey of the day. \"Belisarius,\" said Drosos behind him, half-running to catch up with the General. \"What is it, Drosos?\" He kept walking, but slowed his pace until the Captain was abreast of him. \"I want to know what you really think about the orders. I know you can\u0027t say much in front of the men, but, by the Horns of Moses, you can say more to me.\" They emerged from the hallway into haze-brilliant sunlight. Around them men were struggling to be prepared to march. The noise was tremendous, compounded of shouts and brays, of the sounds of hammers and winches and wagons. Belisarius strode along, careful to stay out of the way of the work, and Drosos dropped slightly behind him. \"Belisarius,\" Drosos insisted as they reached the tents where the saddlers and farriers kept their supplies. \"Yes, I know. What do I think about the orders. I don\u0027t know yet. I don\u0027t know what Justinian is preparing, but I am certain that he must be preparing something.\" He ducked through a tent flap and called out, \"Begoz.\" A gnarled old man answered the call. \"Here, master. I have been doing what I can since before dawn, but you—\" \"I am not criticizing you, Begoz,\" Belisarius assured him. \"I only want to know what progress you\u0027ve made.\" The old man shook his head and indicated the trunks half-filled and standing against the canvas wall. \"There\u0027s not been enough time, sir. Not enough at all. I want to do you credit, but to do that, I need several more hours, and it hasn\u0027t been possible, what with all the comings and goings.\" As he continued his recitation, his voice took on a whine that was irritating to both Belisarius and Drosos. \"You see, when someone orders something special, well, it means that I have to take extra care, and with some of these youngsters coming to me with worn girths and broken saddle-frames, what can I do? They need their tack for battle, don\u0027t they? and that means that such orders as yours must be postponed. You can see why this is so difficult for me.\" \"Yes,\" said Belisarius with more patience than he would have thought necessary. \"And I know that a craftsman of your skill is not going to make a saddle that is anything less than the best you can provide. However, I think you might be a little more vigilant.\" Begoz put his hands to his face. \"I didn\u0027t mean anything against you, General, and I wouldn\u0027t for a moment cause you to be displeased if there were any way I could prevent it.\" He approached, and it was apparent that he had a severe limp; one of his feet was malformed and the leg was twisted, as if a giant hand had taken a doll and tugged the limb out of line. \"No, of course not,\" said Belisarius, making a motion to keep Drosos from speaking out impulsively. \"But that will not prepare the saddle for Olivia, and I would like it to be sent with Drosos when he returns to Constantinople in the next few weeks. If the saddle is ready before he leaves, there will be an advantage for you.\" He reached into the leather pouch that depended from his wide, metal-studded belt. \"This\"—he held up a large gold coin with the image of the Emperor on it, his crown like a halo—\"is yours if the saddle can go with Drosos to Byzantium.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-10.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
