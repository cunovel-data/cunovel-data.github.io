{"id":107755,"no":69,"title":"Page 69","content":"\\n\\n Text of a letter from the physician Mnenodatos to the person who employed him to poison Antonina.\\n\\n To the man who has called himself my benefactor, the physician Mnenodatos sends his apologetic greetings and will try to explain why he must dissappoint this generous person.\\n\\n You have indicated that you are not satisfied with the rate of progress of my \"treatment\" of the August Lady Antonina and wish that she would show more signs of debilitation. If you insist, I am able to give her more of the poison you have instructed me to use, but I warn you that there are many others who would then recognize the nature of her malady and there is an excellent chance that I would be dismissed from the service of Belisarius and be accused, if not of poisoning her myself, of being so incompetent that I did not recognize that she is suffering from such treatment. If I were taken by officers of the magistrate, or by the Guard, I would have to reveal all that I know—which is not much, I admit—about the nature of the person who has engaged and paid me to do this thing.\\n\\n As to your request that a similar ill befall the General himself, I must caution you that one unaccountable illness in a household like this one occasions only sympathy; two would give rise to speculation that neither you nor I would like. It is one thing for a woman of Antonina\u0027s years and temperament to have fevers and aches and sicknesses that no physician can treat, but if her husband should succumb to the same thing, then there are those who will ask questions, and they will not be satisfied with easy answers or vague reassurances. To make the poisoning of the General acceptable, I would have to poison the entire household, slaves and myself included, so that it would appear that the food was tainted. I do not believe that this is a reasonable solution to your problem.\\n\\n If you are eager to be rid of the General, then there are others who will do the deed in any number of ways you might like. Enough gold will purchase far more than a physician\u0027s skill and conscience.\\n\\n Be aware that I am doing all that I may to keep my activities undetected. If I do more, it will go badly. Since you have been willing to wait this long, I ask you take the time required for the poison to do its work. There is no advantage to discovery for any of us, not even for Antonina, poor woman, for she has taken enough of the poison that she cannot be saved no matter what was done for her. I could leave here tomorrow, give her nothing more, and she would last for perhaps two years at the most, and they would not be pleasant years.\\n\\n I urge you to reconsider your request. I have done all that I can, and to undertake to do more would imperil the entire venture. I say this with authority and I ask that you respect my assertion—you respected my ability sufficiently to engage me on this filthy business.\\n\\n Mnenodatos\\n\\n physician\\n\\n 3\\n\\n By the time the Guard arrived to search her house, Niklos had managed to hide most of the incriminating volumes Olivia had not been able to be rid of; there were a few Roman objects that might be considered suspect, but Olivia had said that disposing of all of them might be construed as more suspicious than the possession of one or two Roman items.\\n\\n \"We are here on the order of the Emperor and the Court Censor,\" announced Captain Demitrios as he held out a scroll sealed in three places. \"Your scribe will read it to you.\"\\n\\n \"My Greek is not so bad that I cannot muddle my way through your writ,\" said Olivia as she accepted the document. \"You will watch me break the seals, Captain?\"\\n\\n Taken aback, Captain Demitrios exchanged glances with two of his men. \"If you like. Your sponsor should be here.\"\\n\\n Olivia regarded the Guard Captain evenly. \"My sponsor is General Belisarius. If one of you will go to his house and summon him, I am certain he will come.\"\\n\\n \"General Belisarius,\" repeated Captain Demitrios. \"He is your sponsor.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I turned over my villa outside Roma to him during his campaign and for that he has consented to be my sponsor.\" She was reasonably certain that Captain Demitrios knew something of this, but she was willing to go through the ritual. \"If you would rather, I will send one of my slaves to fetch him.\"\\n\\n \"He ought to be here,\" said Captain Demitrios uncertainly. \"The General—\"\\n\\n Olivia clapped her hands loudly. \"Niklos!\"\\n\\n He responded at once, coming from the smaller of the reception rooms. \"My mistress?\" He favored her with a full reverence that was not lost on the soldiers.\\n\\n \"These Guardsmen require that General Belisarius be here while they perform their duty. Will you ask him to join us. Perhaps, Captain, you will tell my majordomo what your errand is so that he may inform the General?\" She did her best to keep the irony out of her voice, but did not succeed entirely. \"I will ask one of my two cooks to give you wine and something to eat while you wait, Captain.\"\\n\\n The Captain straightened up. \"We will have to stand guard around the house until the General arrives. We cannot act until he has read the orders. It would be best if you did not break the seals; leave that to General Belisarius.\" He was clearly not satisfied with the arrangement but knew his duty.\\n\\n \"Just as you wish. My household is, naturally, at your disposal,\" said Olivia as she stepped back from the armed men. \"Come with me, Niklos, and I will write a note to the General for you to deliver.\"\\n\\n Niklos heard the anger in her tone and he hastened after her, hoping she would contain herself until they were in private. \"My mistress,\" he said as he opened the library to her, \"you have only to command me.\"\\n\\n As soon as the door was closed, Olivia turned her blazing eyes on Niklos. \"I am not allowed to authorize the searching of my own house! It is bad enough that they want to search it, but I cannot read the document! Hecate shrivel them, every one of them!\"\\n\\n \"Hush,\" Niklos warned her.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you—\" She broke off. \"You\u0027re right,\" she admitted after a moment. \"All right. Find me my ink tablet and something to write on. The mood I\u0027m in, I\u0027ll settle for a torn rag.\" She sat down, her shoulders still angular with rage. \"Hurry. I don\u0027t want the good Captain to get restive.\"\\n\\n \"Will Belisarius come?\" asked Niklos.\\n\\n \"I hope he will send a simple authorization, if that\u0027s possible. The whole thing is already intolerable.\" She was working the ink cake, mixing a little water with the square block, rubbing it with a small oval section of ivory until she had enough to write with. She accepted the vellum Niklos handed her and began to write, forming the letters awkwardly since she was not entirely used to the Greek alphabet yet.\\n\\n \"I will tell him what\u0027s going on,\" Niklos promised her.\\n\\n \"Including, no doubt, my state of mind,\" she said, shaking her head slowly. \"Here. Take this. Make sure you show it to that oaf of a Captain.\"\\n\\n \"I will,\" Niklos told her, folding the vellum once and tucking it into his wide belt. He left promptly, winking at her before he closed the door.\\n\\n Olivia sat alone among her shelves, a third of them empty now that the suspect texts had been removed. She forced herself to become calm. There had been other times over the centuries when she had faced worse than this, she reminded herself sternly, and she had been able to win free. She would do it again. If five centuries had taught her nothing else, she had learned a knack for survival. Much as she felt hampered by circumstances, she knew she would find a way; she always had. By the time she left the library, she was in command of herself.\\n\\n Captain Demitrios greeted her return with more respect than he had shown her at first. \"We are truly sorry for this\"—he paused, trying to find a delicate word for intrusion—\"necessity, but a soldier is the tool of the state.\"\\n\\n \"Yes; I am aware of that,\" said Olivia. \"Perhaps you might tell me what you are ordered to look for?\"\\n\\n \"There are a number of things,\" he answered evasively. \"It is spelled out in the writ. The General will explain it all to you when he gets here.\"\\n\\n Olivia bit back a sharp retort and forced herself to say, \"I trust that he will. I trust that someone will. For to be candid, Captain, I do not understand why I am being treated in this way. Everything I brought with me to Konstantinoupolis was on the shipping manifests, and they were approved when I arrived here. There were other items of mine that we found here being sold, which were identified as contraband. What else do you think I have?\"\\n\\n \"Great lady, it is not for me to discuss these matters. I have no knowledge of the reason the Censor wishes to have your house searched.\" He sounded so wooden and formal that Olivia wanted to kick him, to find out if he would feel it at all.\\n\\n \"Then how will you know if you find what the Censor—\" She interrupted herself. \"I suppose all that is in the document.\"\\n\\n Captain Demitrios set his jaw. \"Precisely.\"\\n\\n \"Then, if it is acceptable to you, I will leave you to withdraw to my quarters. Post your guards as you must. I hope it is permissible for me to have one of my slaves attend me while my majordomo is on his errand?\" She hated the sound of her voice and wanted to scream at herself for hypocrisy, at the same time knowing it was the most sensible thing to do.\\n\\n \"We will strive not to disturb you, great lady,\" said Captain Demitrios, relieved enough to show her a slight reverence. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-69.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \\n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
