Her physician came with the highest recommendation. Simones searched him out, and would not accept any but the most skilled for her.\" He touched her arm. \"I am grateful that you tell me what you fear, but I doubt that this case—\"\\n\\n \"Your doubt might speed her death,\" Olivia said directly. \"I do not want to distress you more than—\"\\n\\n \"I know. You are a sensible woman.\" He indicated the palanquin. \"I will send an escort home with you.\"\\n\\n \"That isn\u0027t necessary. If you wish to please me, do something about the physician attending your wife.\" She accepted his dismissal with philosophical grace. \"Thank you for hearing me out. I trust you will receive me again soon.\"\\n\\n \"When there is something to tell you, I will.\" He inclined his head in response to her slight reverence, then turned and went back into his house, his head still lowered, his steps heavy.\\n\\n Olivia watched him go, remorse tugging at her; she had wanted to aid Belisarius, but now she feared she had added to his distress. She got into the palanquin, for once relieved that the curtains had to be drawn.\\n\\n Text of a dispatch to the commanders of the Byzantine navy.\\n\\n To the valiant men who captain our warships, the Emperor sends his blessings and prayers for a successful encounter with the naval forces of the Ostrogoths.\\n\\n As we enter the Lenten season in the Lord\u0027s Year 551, all of the Empire puts its trust and faith in you, and prays that you will prevail over the ships that are being launched against us by the infamous Totila and his barbarians. It is fitting that at this time of the greatest sacrifice you undertake our defense, for surely in going to battle now, you emulate the courage of Our Lord in facing the trials that brought Him to the Cross.\\n\\n As He was raised up to glory, we are confident that you will also be raised up. As He passed through the rigors of Hell and fled the tomb, so we are filled with hope that you will pass through the battles that must be the test of your superior purpose and might to emerge without blemish to the acclaim and praise of all men within the bounds of the Empire.\\n\\n For those who have worried about the cost, fear not that this will impede you. Three new taxes have been levied and the popes and metropolitans have been urged to ask for additional donations to your efforts. If you are willing to risk your lives, then it is fitting that there are a few who will expend their wealth to aid you in your quest for victory.\\n\\n We admonish all of you to be stalwart in your faith and determined in your purpose. You are brave men, all of you, and it is fitting that you should go onto the ocean with the certainty and pride that sets you apart from others and reveals to you and to the Empire that there is no price we are not willing to pay to bring about your triumph.\\n\\n You are not only the officers of our Empire, you are the officers of God, for you fight against pagan barbarians who are attempting to rend the world into tatters where all will be cast into Hell. You save not only your ships and yourselves when you prevail, you save the Empire and the Kingdom of God on earth.\\n\\n Justinian\\n\\n Emperor of Byzantion\\n\\n 6\\n\\n A full moon rode at the crest of the night sky, its pallid shine turning Konstantinoupolis into a monochrome sketch of domes, walls and shadows. From one of the Basilian monasteries came the sound of chanting, and along the walls of the city the night Guard was changed. Those few men on the streets kept to the deepest darkness, their errands demanding concealment and surprise.\\n\\n Niklos was almost to the second square tower when he heard swift footsteps behind him. He slipped into a shallow doorway and waited while his pursuers came abreast of him.\\n\\n There were three men, one of them carrying a wooden cudgel and the other two holding knives. They moved efficiently, spread out in the street, their shoes tied in rags to muffle their sounds. The largest of the three men made a signal to the others and they slowed down, their actions more stealthy than before.\\n\\n When the three men were past his hiding place, Niklos stepped out and followed the men along the street; he carried a glavus in each hand, the wide-bladed weapons catching the shine of the moon on their newly honed edges.\\n\\n Just as the three men reached the entrance to the Church of the Resurrection, one of them turned. He saw Niklos and would have cried out to warn the others, but did not dare to alert the Guard to their presence. He crouched low, his knife swinging up as Niklos moved in, one glavus slicing toward the thief\u0027s shoulder. Deftly he turned the blade on the quillons of his knife, and he might have been able to attack if Niklos had carried only one weapon.\\n\\n As his right glavus swung away, the left cut in hard and low, catching the thief in the thigh, gouging through flesh and striking bone.\\n\\n The thief shrieked, and his companions turned, prepared to fight. The first man fell to the paving, narrowly missing a pile of dung. He clutched his leg in a fruitless attempt to stanch the blood that pumped from the deep wound he had been given.\\n\\n The man with the cudgel raised his weapon as he advanced, bringing it down in front of him, aiming not for Niklos\u0027 swords but for his arms and shoulders; this disabling blow ought to leave their opponent helpless.\\n\\n Niklos sprang backward, out of range of the cudgel, both glavi held ready to stop an attack.\\n\\n The second man with a knife was moving against the buildings on the other side of the street, sliding in the darkness, to outflank Niklos.\\n\\n As the man with the cudgel swung again, Niklos leaped at him, choosing the thief\u0027s most vulnerable instant—when his cudgel was low and he had not yet been able to swing it into position for another blow. His left glavus bit deep into the man\u0027s shoulder, penetrating just under the collarbone. The man howled and staggered away from the blade.\\n\\n The third man hesitated, and then, seeing his chance, rushed in, his knife held to strike Niklos low in the back. But he had forgot his comrade who lay bleeding, and in his haste, he tripped over the other\u0027s arm. Cursing, stumbling, he blundered into Niklos\u0027 right blade, taking it along his ribs.\\n\\n In the next street there was the sound of running, and Niklos did not wait to discover who might be approaching. He grasped his swords and raced away from the three wounded men.\\n\\n \"That was an impressive display,\" murmured the merchant from Tyre who had agreed to meet with Niklos that night.\\n\\n \"I thought they might have already found you,\" Niklos said as he stopped to wipe the blood away.\\n\\n \"Are you hurt?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing to speak of,\" Niklos assured him. \"But I want to get off the street.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" The merchant opened the door where he had been waiting and led Niklos into a courtyard. \"I have been given the use of this house by another merchant, a Konstantinoupolitan who is currently on a voyage to purchase fine cloth and copper. I have extended the same courtesy to him when he has been in Tyre.\"\\n\\n \"And when do you return to Tyre?\"\\n\\n \"I plan to leave in little less than a month. I was told that you might wish to travel with me at that time.\" He indicated a bench beside a fountain. \"Sit. We will discuss your requirements in comfort.\"\\n\\n Niklos made a reverence. \"You\u0027re gracious.\"\\n\\n \"It is not difficult to be gracious to a man who is willing to pay forty pieces of gold to leave the city.\" He smiled, his teeth blue-white in his gray-seeming face. \"It must be important.\"\\n\\n \"I and my… companion are eager to depart. There is a question of removing certain belongings that we are prepared to abandon for the opportunity to be gone.\" He waited. \"You have arranged such departures before, or so I have been told by those who are reliable in these matters.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" the merchant said slowly, relishing the word. \"But I am curious about the risk I might be taking. It is an easy thing to say that you are being treated unjustly; it might be that you are truly a criminal.\" He stroked his short beard and went on, musing aloud, \"It might be more sensible to inquire at the office of the Censor to learn why you are so willing to pay me to get you out of here.\"\\n\\n \"You may ask what you want, where you want. Surely I am not the only Roman who has decided to leave this city. Romans are not welcome here, and there are many who strive to make our presence a trial for everyone. Rather than wait for the Censor to determine what of my possessions are acceptable, I prefer to abandon the lot of them and seek refuge in a place that is less unfriendly. I have fled Roma already. I am prepared to leave Konstantinoupolis on the same terms.\" He deliberately let his Latin accent become stronger. \"There have been edicts of late that have resulted in the seizure of Roman goods. Before I have to give up what little I was able to save, I want to be away from here.\"\\n\\n \"You and your companion,\" said the merchant.\\n\\n \"Yes; I and my companion.\" He regarded the merchant steadily. \"If you are not prepared to help me, say so, and I will have to search out another.\"\\n\\n The merchant chuckled. \"Do you believe that you will find another? Don\u0027t you realize that you are under suspicion, as are all Romans?\" He toyed with a small dagger that depended from the wide leather belt that held his ample girth. \"You haven\u0027t yet accepted the seriousness of your position here, and for that you are going to suffer.\" He shook his head. \"No, no, my poor Roman friend, you have more to contend with. You say you want to leave because of a desire to retain a few possessions. If you do that, you will be fortunate indeed. You might well lose your life, and that makes our bargain a more critical one.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-77.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \\n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
