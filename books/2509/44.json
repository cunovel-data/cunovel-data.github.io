My guest would not be pleased to watch me eat with nothing for herself.\" \"Of course,\" said Simones, and made his reverence as he withdrew. \"He knows he went too far,\" Eugenia said as soon as the slave left the room. \"He\u0027s making amends, isn\u0027t he?\" \"He\u0027s trying,\" Antonina allowed. \"He also knows that if he were sold now, he would not find a master who would please him even as much as my husband does now in his current position.\" Eugenia helped herself to the wine. \"You must not see many visitors.\" \"Not welcome ones,\" Antonina confirmed darkly. \"Who calls on you?\" She was wondering how conspicuous her own visit would be, and how much of a risk she had taken in coming. \"A few of the officers call, but they must come with a pope with the Censor\u0027s approval. Drosos has been here most often. I have seen the widows of those officers who fell in Italy and Africa.\" She stared at the window, angry with the storm. \"The relatives who are not at court have visited me, and a few of my husband\u0027s mother\u0027s family have come. That Roman widow Olivia has been here three times. The four daughters of Aristinos Pavko have been here, but now that they are religious, they are bound by the rules of their community, and we have little we may discuss.\" \"That\u0027s all?\" Eugenia asked, horrified at the degree to which she had exposed herself to censure. \"All that are welcome. You see how things have changed here. A year ago I would not have been eager to listen to four young women tell me why it is heretical to believe that the nature of Christ was more divine than human.\" She finished the wine in her cup and filled it again. By the time Eugenia left her hostess, she was feeling reckless and light-headed. Her visit, which seemed the most terrible folly an hour before, now felt more pleasant, an adventure that had an air of heroism about it because of what it did for Antonina. Let others hesitate and worry and keep away for fear of what the Censor might say; she, Eugenia, would not be intimidated. She would visit her old friend and show that she had the same strength of purpose as Belisarius\u0027 officers. In this frame of mind, she was almost to the door, and thinking of a few pithy things to say to the Guards, when she noticed that Simones was waiting for her. \"Come to apologize to me?\" she asked, her words not quite as crisp as usual. \"Or do you want me to intercede for you and get you back into your mistress\u0027 favor?\" \"Neither,\" Simones said. \"I want to arrange a few things with you.\" Eugenia was too astonished to be affronted. \"With me? You?\" \"I have to find someone who will assist me, and you are the most promising. Antonina trusts you and she wants to see you. She believes that you will not desert her as most of the others have done, and you still can benefit from her favor, which none of her other friends could.\" He watched her, curious to see what her reaction would be. \"What if I go back to her right now and tell her what you have said?\" There was a speculative light in her eyes and she waited to hear what Simones would say. \"That would not be wise,\" said Simones. \"You might be rid of me, but another would come in my place and he might decide that Antonina is to be kept in isolation for the good of the Emperor.\" \"And you?\" asked Eugenia, curious and becoming apprehensive. \"I know that my mistress is distressed and lonely, which is unfortunate. I know that no matter what she says, she is eager for your company and wishes that you might continue to visit her in spite of the risk that such visits entail. You do not know how devastating this has been, and you do not know how much she has longed for the Emperor to relax the restrictions against this household. But that isn\u0027t going to happen for some time yet.\" He watched her. \"She depends upon you, although she does not know it.\" \"Why do you tell me this?\" She was aware that Simones had no reason to sacrifice so much to Antonina, and she suspected the level of dislike the slave had for his mistress. \"Because I need assistance,\" he said bluntly. \"I have been ordered\"—he used the word deliberately—\"to watch and make note of all that happens in this household. Certainly I do what I must because of the order of the Emperor and his Censor. I am in no position to do otherwise.\" \"And what if Antonina discovers your duplicity?\" Eugenia asked with malice in her smile. \"Why should she know anything of it?\" countered Simones with a distinct threat in his tone. \"Anything might happen. And then off to the copper mines?\" She shrugged. \"If I am sent to the copper mines, there will be others with me.\" He folded his arms. \"Why not assist one another? You could impress the Censor with your devotion and there is no reason that anything you said to me would compromise Antonina.\" Simones knew how to be persuasive. \"You would advance yourself and not add to Antonina\u0027s discredit. Think of the advantage that you could have. This would be one way you might return some of the favor Antonina has shown you over the years. You would be able to inform her of your actions when the Court Censor is satisfied that her husband is not guilty of any conspiracy or has supported any plots against the Emperor. Your activities on her behalf would be re-warded and you would show Antonina that you are to be trusted and respected.\" \"You wheedle and tempt, don\u0027t you?\" Eugenia asked, but there was a speculative turn to her face now and she did not move away from him or reprimand him for making such a suggestion. \"Hardly,\" he said. \"I only mention this so that we might both benefit and aid this household during its troubles.\" He resisted the urge to smile, knowing that she would be offended by smiles. \"A woman in my position cannot take risks, slave. I have no one who can sponsor me if I am questioned or accused. I have little money, and my husband\u0027s family has some influence but not enough to influence anyone near the Censor.\" \"And so it would be sensible of you to think about acting on your own behalf so that you have some position and protection. It would give you access to the court again, and with the gratitude of the Censor, you can be confident of his aid in attaining your ends. He will see your merit and wish to thank you.\" Simones saw that there were three household slaves approaching them, and he abandoned his efforts at once. \"I hope you will consider what I have said.\" \"I may,\" said Eugenia as she went toward the vestibule. Text of an Imperial edict. To all Christians living within the boundaries of our Empire, and to those of good conscience living elsewhere in the world, the greetings of Justinian and the Peace of God be with you. We have prayed long for divine guidance in the matter of unchristian works, and works of heresy. We are aware that the Christ admonished us to embrace our enemies and to be sparing in our judgment of others, yet He also stated that we must be free of the Devil\u0027s work if we are to be with Him in Heaven. To that end, we have considered the writings that are not of Orthodox Christian origin, which lead to dissension and confusion in our people, and we have consulted with our popes and metropolitans as well as other religious, and we have realized that these works, many of them well-intentioned, are the subtle and. dangerous works that lure men from Christ and damn the souls of many to everlasting suffering. For that reason alone the works stand condemned. But there are greater considerations: these works might easily contribute to sedition and other traitorous acts, which marks them as the tools of those without Grace. Books that purport to teach and have no thought of God and salvation in them are worse than lies and deception, for their treachery lies in their seeming innocence. Therefore we are requiring that all Christians examine their souls and review the books they possess. If what the books contain are not worthy of Christian study and if they are filled with heresies and lies, we ask that you show your devotion by burning these books and encouraging those around you to do the same with their books. We are certain that when this is done, much of the ambivalence that has caused such misfortune to the Christians of this Empire will be brought to an end, and the disputes that have led to so many unchristian sentiments and attitudes will be lessened. We are reminded that to aid those in need is the purpose of charity, and so if any of you are aware of those who are misguided and who seek to preserve their books, for whatever reason, no matter how sincere, that you attempt to persuade them to be rid of these sources of doubt and failing that leads inevitably to perdition and the perpetual torments of hell. With the concurrence of the Court Censor and the popes and metropolitans, we wish all of you Godspeed in these great spiritual acts that will purge us all of much evil.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-44.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
