{"id":107732,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"\"Yes. All sorts of furniture. I saw some vases and braziers as well, but nothing I could identify for certain.\" He gave a short sigh. \"Aha.\" She drummed her fingers on the table. \"So someone has helped themselves to what was left behind.\" \"It seems so,\" Niklos agreed. \"But who it is, I have no way of discovering yet—\" \"We will find out in due course,\" she said with determination. \"And when we do, there are steps to be taken.\" She got up suddenly and began to pace. \"I have been afraid this would happen. I sensed the possibility when we left. When Belisarius was recalled, I knew that any protection the villa might have had was lost. I\u0027ve almost expected it.\" She touched her hair, fidgeting with the ordered arrangement of pins. \"Olivia,\" Niklos said, sharing her indignation, \"tell me what you wish me to do.\" \"I suppose we had best find out how to make a complaint, and to whom. And you may be certain that you or a churchman or possibly even Belisarius will have to do the thing officially, since according to the law here, I cannot own property!\" She flung a small iron stylus across the room. Niklos retrieved it and held it out to her. \"You\u0027ll want this later.\" She was still too angry to be chagrined, but she took it and put it back on the table. \"They are so certain, aren\u0027t they, that they will look after the interests of their women, and they cannot conceive of a situation arising where their judgment is not superior. It comes from having all those male gods. And do not remind me,\" she went on more sharply, \"that they are all aspects of one god. I know Jupiter, Apollo and Mercury when I see them, no matter how they are got up.\" \"I wasn\u0027t going to say anything,\" Niklos assured her. This time she looked him straight in the eye. \"You\u0027re very clever, my friend, and I am grateful for that.\" \"You\u0027re not a dolt yourself,\" Niklos pointed out. \"And why does Drosos have to be gone now, I ask you. Why does he have to be on his way to Alexandria. After all those weeks of wanting to do something for me and not knowing what, he would have to be gone the one time I truly need him.\" She went and stared out her window; the oiled parchment had been moved aside and the scent of the garden drifted into the library. \"Then what shall it be?\" asked Niklos. \"Do you wish me to make inquiries?\" \"Yes, but first go to Belisarius. Or better yet, I will go, and I will speak with him. He was at the villa. He will want to know what has been taken in any case.\" She adjusted the drape of her paenula. \"I suppose I must use one of the palanquins, with the curtains drawn. It\u0027s exasperating.\" \"I will see that one is summoned,\" said Niklos. \"Yes. Thank you for that. And then arrangements will have to be made to have the stall searched thoroughly, and the storehouse of the merchant as well, I guess. What else should we do? What a tremendous amount of work.\" She sighed. \"Would you rather accept the losses?\" She rounded on Niklos. \"Magna Mater, no! And you know it.\" \"Then to Belisarius first?\" he suggested. \"Yes. Belisarius first.\" Now that she was set on a task, her manner changed. She moved with determination and there was no trace of doubt in her attitude. By the time Niklos had found a palanquin, Olivia had changed her dalmatica and paenula so that she was more formally attired. She had deliberately chosen Roman cloth and her most Roman jewels to wear on her visit. As she stepped into the palanquin, she said to Niklos, \"If there are questions from the Guard, you are to make this as official as you can. I came here with Belisarius\u0027 sponsorship, and now that my goods have been seized, I am requesting his aid in reclaiming them. They won\u0027t question that.\" \"As you say,\" Niklos concurred. The streets were still busy and it took some little time to go from one hill to the next. The noise was particularly loud near the places where the streets were being widened and old buildings were being torn down to make way for them. \"This is worse than Traianus,\" Olivia complained from inside the palanquin. \"What is it with men in power that they have sudden impulses to remake the world?\" \"It\u0027s not a bad idea,\" Niklos said. \"These streets are far too narrow for all the traffic and the stalls and shops as well.\" \"And so for the next year or two, no one can move along them at all,\" Olivia declared, then said a bit more contritely, \"If I weren\u0027t already irritated, it would not annoy me as much. Bear with me.\" She continued to speak in Latin. Niklos patted the drawn curtains. \"How long have I served you? Wasn\u0027t the beginning the same year that Commodus was murdered?\" He had taken a more playful tone with her, and now he chuckled. \"Roma was not yet a thousand years old.\" \"It wasn\u0027t, was it?\" Olivia asked, her voice less harsh than before. \"It was the last thing Sanct\u0027 Germain did before he went—\" She stopped. \"If he were here, he\u0027d deal with this and there would be no reason for us to be out here on the street going to Belisarius\u0027 house. And if we were in Roma, I could take care of the whole thing myself.\" A little of the gruff ness had returned, and she cleared her throat in a conscious effort to be rid of the sound. \"But he is not here, and we are not in Roma but in… Konstantinoupolis, and so we must proceed as the laws require us to proceed.\" \"Philosophy becomes you,\" Niklos teased gently. \"Oh, Niklos,\" she said, permitting herself a rare moment of despair, \"what has become of us?\" \"We\u0027re almost to Belisarius\u0027 house,\" Niklos warned, continuing in Greek. \"There are five Guards at the front of the house.\" \"Speak to the one who is highest in rank,\" said Olivia, also in Greek. \"And be very respectful. They put great store by subservience here.\" \"It\u0027s their way,\" Niklos agreed, and adopted a more humble manner than he usually had. \"Good Captain,\" he said when he had come near enough to be heard clearly, \"my mistress seeks a word with Belisarius.\" The Captain, a lanky young man with a narrow face and haughty attitude, regarded Niklos contemptuously. \"And who is your mistress that she comes here?\" \"The Roman widow, Atta Olivia Clemens. General Belisarius was her sponsor when she left Italy, and it is in that regard that she wishes to speak to him now.\" Niklos motioned to the chairmen to put the palanquin down. \"It is a matter of some urgency, good Guardsman, and one that requires the General\u0027s attention.\" The Captain laughed. \"What could that be?\" \"It concerns theft,\" Niklos said baldly. \"The losses are considerable and my mistress is in need of aid and advice.\" He knew that this was in accord with Byzantine propriety but he disliked the unnecessary complexity of fulfilling a simple request. \"The General might not be able to do much for your mistress,\" warned the Captain. \"Then he will have to direct her to those who can,\" Niklos said, becoming impatient. \"Good Captain, if you are going to refuse my mistress admittance here, then tell me at once so that we may seek out a pope at Hagia Sophia or Hagia Irene to give us the benefit of his counsel.\" The Captain moved aside from the door. \"What is the widow\u0027s name again?\" \"Atta Olivia Clemens, widow of Cornelius Justus Silius,\" Niklos said accurately. He did not add that her husband had been executed during the reign of the elder Titus Flavius Vespasianus, almost five hundred years ago. \"Clemens, Clemens,\" mused the Captain. \"Is that the one who lives alone in the house with two gardens?\" \"That is she,\" Niklos acknowledged, somewhat surprised that the Captain of the Guard would know of her. \"And she wishes to see Belisarius about a theft?\" \"Yes; I have said so already.\" Niklos covered his sharpness by adding, \"She is very angry and has been taking out her feelings on the backs of her household.\" The Captain grinned. \"Romans are excessive.\" He indicated the door. \"You and your mistress may enter, and Belisarius will be informed that you have come. If he says he wishes to see your mistress, then she will be given the chance to speak with him. Otherwise, you must leave at once. Is that understood?\" \"It\u0027s understood,\" said Niklos, bending to assist Olivia out of the palanquin. Simones was waiting for them just inside the door and he regarded Olivia speculatively as she came into the house behind Niklos. \"Great lady, I am surprised to see you here.\" \"I am a little surprised to be here,\" said Olivia loudly enough to have her words reach the Guard outside. \"But circumstances require that I speak with your master.\" Simones made a belated reverence to Olivia and ignored Niklos. \"I will inform him of your arrival. May I tell him why you have come?\" \"It concerns my villa near Roma. He stayed there some of the time during his campaign.\" She gave a direct, hard stare to the eunuch slave. \"That ought to be sufficient, Simones.\" After a second reverence, Simones hastened away, only to return promptly with word that Belisarius would wait upon Olivia in the larger reception room. \"I will claim the honor of escorting you there,\" he added when he had delivered the information.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-46.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
