Be certain you have proof, or drop it.\" He did not want any of the decisions he had made regarding heretics and sorcerers called into question now, for Justinian had already indicated that he wanted to be rid of all of them at once, as he had been rid of the pernicious books at Alexandria. As Censor, it would be his task to carry out such a command, but he feared that the confusion that would result, the charges and countercharges, would lead to an unrest that the Emperor did not appreciate, and he would be unable to explain. \"I do not want to be told that you have heard rumors, or that there are those who think she might be enchanting cats. Is that understood. You must be able to demonstrate your charge or you must remove it.\"\n From her place on the bench, Olivia said, \"You sound almost Roman, Censor.\"\n \"You do yourself no good speaking to me that way,\" Athanatadies told her, though he continued to look at Konstantos. \"In ten days, I will want to have word about this woman. If there is no word, you will have to give reason why you have not done what is required of you. And if you cannot, then you will have to answer to Belisarius.\" With that last ominous promise, he was gone.\n The reception chamber was silent; Panaigios shuffled papers.\n \"The earth shows worship and reverence to God,\" called Pope Sylvestros. \"In homage to the Might of God, the people are silent.\"\n \"Then you be silent, too,\" snapped Konstantos. He signaled to Captain Vlamos. \"You know where the detention rooms are. See that she has one of the better ones, with a good bed.\" He favored Olivia with a malicious smile. \"That is in case you wish to entertain friends.\"\n Olivia had been expecting some attack, and she did not respond to it. \"Captain Vlamos, lead the way.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, great lady,\" he said, \"but I must bind your hands and keep hold of the thongs.\"\n \"Of course.\" She held out crossed wrists. She wanted to lash out with her feet and hands, then flee, but that was worse than folly. \"Not too tight, I pray.\"\n As Captain Vlamos secured the thongs, he asked, \"Will this be too bad?\"\n \"No,\" she said honestly. As she was about to be led away, she glanced at the three men. \"When the day comes that this happens to you—and do not think that impossible—remember me.\" Then she nodded to Captain Vlamos and went out of the chamber toward the detention rooms at the other end of the enormous building.\n Text of a letter from Niklos to Belisarius.\n To the distinguished General who is sponsor to my mistress Olivia Clemens, my greetings and supplications.\n Six days ago my mistress was taken by the Guard to answer questions of the Censor\u0027s officers. She has not returned home since then, and all attempts to discover what has become of her have met with nothing.\n Since I am a bondsman and my mistress is a Roman there is little I can do beyond what has already been done. Therefore I have to ask that you act to find out what has happened to her and to take all measures to see that she is restored at once to her house and to your protection.\n I had a few words with a Captain Vlamos, who was one of those who came to take her to the Censor, and he told me that the Censor has an accusation of sorcery against my mistress, which is not only a defamation of her character, but it places her in gravest danger with no means to refute such a charge.\n Should you require it of me, I will place the resources of this household at your disposal to aid in any and all ways possible to secure the release and total exoneration of my mistress as well as demanding and receiving damages for what she has had to endure on these false and mendacious charges.\n It is my belief that those who have brought these charges did so with malicious intent, for everything they have said has served to divide her from her household, her goods, and your protection. Since you have not been called, I have assumed that you are likely to be implicated by these charges or be found to be the victim of what is alleged.\n Captain Vlamos has said that he will speak with you if you require it of him, for that is his responsibility as an officer of the Guard, since you are my mistress\u0027 sponsor here. I urge you to do so as soon as possible, for there is no telling what indignities might have been forced upon my mistress, who has already suffered enough in coming to this city. If the Captain will tell you what we need to know, then I will take action at once and do my utmost to save my mistress from any more travail.\n I must warn you that I have been informed that sorcerers are executed by being put into a sack and thrown into the sea. I do not want to make demands of you, great General, but I am certain that neither of us wish to have that happen to Olivia. Since those executions are carried out in secret, I am afraid that we have less time to discover her whereabouts and take action than we might have under other circumstances.\n While it pains me to intrude on your mourning and grief, I would rather do this than add to your losses, for that is what is likely to happen if you will not insist on some resolution of this dreadful business at once.\n The Censor\u0027s officers Konstantos and Panaigios are pursuing the case for the Censor and the Emperor. They will not answer me, but they must answer you. I beg you to approach them at once, for to tell truth, I fear for my mistress more than I ever have in my life.\n Niklos Aulirios\n bondsman to\n Atta Olivia Clemens\n P.S. The slave Zejhil has asked to be permitted to aid you in any way she can. She carries this letter, and I have given her permission to remain with you and to act in any capacity you deem necessary. Certainly you may do so as Olivia\u0027s sponsor, but in case the Censor decides that there is a valid charge and attempts to seize all of my mistress\u0027 household and goods, you will be able to retain Zejhil. Listen to her, Belisarius. She has been a great help to us. With this, I include Olivia\u0027s endorsement of Zejhil\u0027s writ of manumission, along with a request that she be given thirty gold pieces when she is freed. I trust you will honor my mistress\u0027 decision in regard to this slave.\n 9\n Shortly after Captain Vlamos left Belisarius\u0027 house, Simones requested permission to be gone for an hour, and so was not present when Eugenia arrived and begged to speak with the General.\n The eunuch slave Arius admitted her and told her that his master was not to be disturbed.\n \"I have to speak with him,\" Eugenia said, her eyes brimming with tears. \"He is my only hope, and if he won\u0027t see me, I have no other chance to save myself.\"\n Arius knew Eugenia from her friendship with Anto-nina, and for that reason he faltered. Belisarius might want to see this old friend of his dead wife, but then again, the presence of Eugenia might recall his loss. Weighing these two considerations only became more puzzling, and so at last he said, \"Wait here, great lady, and I will speak with my master.\"\n Eugenia looked about the vestibule a little wildly. \"Let me sit in the smaller reception room,\" she said, precariously near begging. \"I don\u0027t want… anyone to know I am here. The matter is confidential.\" She held out a silver coin. \"You must tell no one but your master that I have come. No one. No other member of this household.\"\n Arius took the coin, more out of surprise than greed. \"Of course, great lady.\" He tucked the coin under his belt and went to Belisarius\u0027 study.\n \"Tell her I\u0027m busy,\" said Belisarius, who was deep in conversation with the Tartar slave from the Roman woman\u0027s household.\n \"She is weeping, General,\" said Anus, who assumed he owed Eugenia that much for the coin.\n Belisarius sighed. \"Where is she?\"\n \"In the smaller reception room.\" Arms made a reverence to his master. \"She is very… upset.\"\n Zejhil rose and made her reverence. \"I have more than enough to do. I will be busy for the rest of the afternoon with the tasks you have set me. You must attend to your guest, of course.\" Without any fuss, she withdrew.\n \"All right,\" Belisarius said with a resigned hitch to his shoulders. \"Show me to her, Arius.\"\n Eugenia was seated in the darkest corner of the room, her back to the door, hunched over. She had dressed plainly and without any of her customary ornaments and jewels. As Arius came into the room, she started, then recovered herself and rose. \"I am very sorry to disturb you at this terrible time, General,\" she began with proper formality.\n \"If you disturbed me, it must be for something more than a consolation call,\" he said tersely, motioning to Arius to leave them alone. \"You have something you wanted to say to me.\"\n \"Yes,\" she said, color mounting in her face. \"It\u0027s very difficult. I don\u0027t know where to begin.\" She was hardly audible at these last words.\n Belisarius took his place on the padded bench. \"Shall I send for some refreshments?\"\n \"No!\" Her protest was a wail. \"No. I don\u0027t want anyone to know I am here, no one in your household.\" She caught the edge of her paenula and began to twist it in her fingers. \"I tried to tell you this before. If I could bring myself to write, it might have been easier to set it down, for I would not have to see your face while I told you.\" She cleared her throat, then coughed; neither effort raised her voice or her confidence. \"I… I\u0027ve tried to do this before, but I have been afraid.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-85.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
