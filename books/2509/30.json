{"id":107716,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"\"A sharp-tongued servant is a disgrace to a household,\" stated the larger eunuch with a significant nod toward the Guards who remained in the room. \"If you were a bondsman in this household, you would be whipped for your insolence.\"\n \"My mistress does not flog her servants except for criminal acts,\" said Niklos, attempting to show humility again. \"It is her practice to encourage our speaking out so that complaints may be dealt with before they become so significant an issue that they cannot be resolved.\"\n \"When that happens, the slave is sold,\" the smaller eunuch declared. \"That is how it is done here.\"\n \"But my mistress, as you have said and as I have said, is a Roman lady, and it is her practice to conduct herself as a Roman.\" Niklos looked at the Guards. \"Have either of you served in the Italian campaign?\"\n The Guard with scarred knuckles answered. \"I served there for a year.\"\n \"Then you will vouch for what I say,\" said Niklos. \"The Romans are not like you Konstantinoupolitans, and they have other standards for their dealings with their slaves and servants. I am used to those ways, as is Olivia Clemens, and we are not yet accustomed to the manners of this city.\" He looked to the Guard once more. \"You have seen Roma? You know how Romans live?\"\n \"I have seen Roma, but the people were leaving in droves and everyone said that the times were remarkable.\" He cleared his throat. \"Still, we heard enough and saw enough that I will agree with what you say; the Romans do manage servants and slaves in ways that we do not.\" He addressed the eunuchs. \"He is freespoken, but it is not so strange in a Roman.\"\n The larger eunuch glared. \"You may be correct, but that does not mean that suspicion is therefore diverted from the Roman woman, or from this bondsman.\" With that declaration, he folded his arms and fell silent.\n \"Why do you seek to defend your mistress?\" demanded the smaller eunuch, then stopped himself as the door opened and a tall, elegant man came into the room. He was partially bald and so thin that he appeared to be perpetually in profile, his body angling away from his hips as if he were slightly bent. His face was lined but expressionless. Both eunuchs made him a deep reverence.\n The tall man paid them no heed but directed all his attention to Niklos Aulirios. \"I am Konstantos Mardinopolis,\" he announced, as if the name carried impact.\n \"You are not the Censor,\" said Niklos.\n \"No, but I am his nearest associate,\" said the tall man. \"He has entrusted me with this inquiry.\" He indicated the eunuchs. \"You may be certain that these faithful servants will bear witness to what we discover.\"\n \"How fortunate,\" said Niklos, his face revealing nothing of his misgivings.\n \"In other circumstances we would conduct this through the eunuchs themselves, but since your mistress is a lady of dignity and fortune, it has been decided that my presence is required.\" He took a seat at the long table and ostentatiously unrolled a sheet of vellum. He then set out an inkstand and a stylus. \"I will make notes of what is said and the eunuchs will sign what I have written if they judge it to be accurate for what has passed between us.\"\n \"May I see your record, as well?\" asked Niklos.\n \"It will be read to you,\" Konstantos said. \"You will find that is enough protection.\" He looked up, his features still set and without any feeling. \"That will suffice, won\u0027t it?\"\n \"If you put down what is said accurately and completely, I do not see why it should not be.\" He straightened himself and waited. \"I am at your disposal.\"\n Konstantos did not speak at once, but took his time in writing the circumstances of the examination on the sheet before him, unaware that Niklos was able to read what was there. \"It has come to the attention of the Censor that your mistress has made the acquaintance of the Empress Theodora.\"\n This was not the question Niklos had anticipated, and he was startled enough to stammer when he answered. \"S-she has, through the wife of Belisarius.\"\n \"That would be Antonina,\" said Konstantos unnecessarily. \"And we are aware that when they met, the Empress Theodora made reference to enemies that might attempt to discredit your mistress. Perhaps you will tell us who these enemies are.\"\n \"If I knew, I would. I am my mistress\u0027 majordomo, but I do not share her confidences,\" he lied. \"If she has knowledge of enemies, she has not told me of them. I do know that she was surprised by the warning, and took it much to heart because it came from the Empress herself.\"\n \"If you do not know what enemies these are, why did your mistress heed the warning?\"\n \"Would you not heed a warning from the Empress?\" countered Niklos. \"To do less would be insulting to Theodora.\"\n \"That is true. Yet since your mistress has taken no additional action, we must assume that she does not believe that the warning was genuine.\" He stopped speaking to write. \"What can you say to that?\"\n \"I do not know what my mistress has decided. It is not for me to question her.\" He made a sign of protection.\n \"Why do you speak so?\" asked Konstantos as blandly as possible.\n \"To do anything else would be disrespectful and improper.\" He stared at the stylus as it moved over the vellum and he wanted to correct the words that appeared there, but dared not. \"It is important to remember that I am her bondsman,\" Niklos went on, still reading upside down. \"Here in Konstantinoupolis you are more stringent about these things than are most Romans; surely you know that I would be exceeding my station to require any explanation of my mistress in regard to her conduct in this or any other matter.\"\n \"Surely,\" murmured Konstantos.\n The questioning continued for most of the afternoon, and when Niklos was finally escorted back to Olivia\u0027s house he was more shaken than his demeanor revealed. He dismissed the Guards with aplomb that was far from genuine, and took care to wait a while before seeking out Olivia, for he was convinced that at least one of the household slaves was spying for the Censor or one of his officers.\n \"You were gone quite a while,\" said Olivia when\n Niklos finally answered her summons to wait upon her in her reception room.\n \"Yes,\" he agreed.\n \"For good reason, I suspect,\" she said casually, having caught his slight warning gesture as he entered the room.\n \"The officers of the Censor were seeking information,\" he said carefully.\n \"About me as well as you?\" She was certain of it but knew enough not to make this too apparent.\n \"Yes, and to discourage any comments on the early life of the Empress Theodora.\" This had been part of the inquiry and Niklos knew he was safe discussing it.\n \"Oh, you mean the rumors one hears about public dancing and harlotry,\" said Olivia with faint laughter. \"It is always thus, isn\u0027t it, when a woman who is not born noble catches the fancy of an Emperor. No one takes such gossip seriously.\"\n \"That is what I said,\" Niklos told her, making a sign to let her know that they were being overheard.\n \"I hope so. Think of all the tales you have heard about me over the years. You are my majordomo and you know how I spend my time, and with whom, and yet you have been told of my many lovers, most of whom I have never met. I trust you made it clear that I put no stock in such… speculations. I assume it comes from envious fools who do not know how fine a woman Theodora is, or how great is Justinian\u0027s love for her.\"\n Niklos nodded encouragement. \"I hope I conveyed some of your thoughts. There was also some concern about your life before you came here.\"\n \"The same questions as you were asked about Theodora?\" guessed Olivia.\n \"To some extent. The Court Censor is aware that Drosos is your lover, but there has been some hint that there are many others and that you are nothing more than a loose woman who has tricked everyone into believing you are noble.\" It was one of the questions that Konstantos had repeated in many forms and Niklos knew that it was important to still such speculation.\n \"Let them go to the tombs by the Via Appia and see those of the Clemens and my husband\u0027s family; Clemens and Silius are old and exalted names in the history of Roma, and I can show documents going back to the time of the Caesars that prove my claims.\" She sounded more indignant than she was—her greatest emotion was cold fear.\n \"Sadly, there have been so many records destroyed thanks to the raids of Totila\u0027s army it may be no longer possible to produce the proofs you mention,\" Niklos said, lifting one brow to let her know that this was the story he had held to. \"Ever since we learned that the villa had been gutted, I have lost all hope ever to find your family records again.\"\n \"Ah,\" she sighed, her relief more genuine than the distress she tried to show. \"It is sad to see so many things lost. The villa… how I will miss it.\"\n \"And the material you have lost—that is important, too.\" He leaned forward and said in an undervoice, \"Olivia, you are in danger. Be careful what you say.\"\n \"Yes, it is important,\" she said, cocking her head toward the door. \"There are other estates that I will probably never recover. How fortunate that my late husband will never learn of this, for he was a man of great pride, as were all the Silii.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-30.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
