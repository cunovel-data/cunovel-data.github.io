Let me point out one thing to you, and you may then do what you wish: the soldiers can create a corridor from gate to dockside, and can keep most of the people from spilling over into your city, if you will permit them to act in that way. It would be the best use of the men you have and it would limit the amount of damage you are apt to sustain during the time the Romans are in Neapolis.\"\n \"Are those your orders?\" asked the oldest suspiciously.\n \"No, those are my observations. You are free to do as you wish with the men so long as your orders do not contradict those of the Emperor.\" He stretched. \"It has been more than a full day since I slept, good citizens. Perhaps you will be content to leave this for another time?\"\n \"How can we leave this, when you will be gone tomorrow?\" asked the one with the darkest beard.\n \"There will be other men here. Most of my officers are experienced and will do what they can to make this a worthwhile time for all of you.\" He moved away from the narrow table. \"I will instruct them to guard the city from abuse. If you will let them do the work they are trained to do, everyone will benefit, even the unfortunates from Roma.\"\n \"And you will not have to answer for anything that goes wrong. You will be able to say that if there are problems, if there are those who are injured or in other ways harmed, that it was our actions, not yours, that brought this about. We have heard about the manner in which you of Constantinople conduct your affairs.\"\n \"Lepidius,\" said Belisarius, \"even if everything you say is true, and everything you believe is true and everything you deplore is true, nonetheless, Justinian is the Emperor and what he orders and demands is his by right of his rule. If you question that, you question the order of the world and the word of Heaven.\" He reached for a small mallet and struck a small, flat bell with it. \"You will be fed while you are here, if you wish. My slaves will see to it.\"\n \"And you?\" asked the monk, clearly not satisfied with the hospitality Belisarius offered.\n \"I will be attending to my duties with my officers so that they will be prepared to act for you tomorrow.\" He gestured to the slave who came through the door. \"These men are to be given every courtesy a guest can expect. Is Chrysanthos here, or has he already gone to his men?\"\n \"He is still here, Master,\" said the slave in Egyptian-accented Greek.\n \"Then let him dine with these citizens,\" said Belisarius in Greek.\n \"Does this man speak Latin?\" the youngest member of the delegation wanted to know.\n \"Yes, that is why I thought of him. You will be able to understand one another. I have three other officers who are fluent in Latin as well as Greek, and they are most in demand of the men I command in Italy.\" Belisarius indicated the slave. \"If you follow him, he will see that you are escorted to Chrysanthos.\"\n Most of the men were willing to depart, but the one with the darkest beard was inclined to linger, to press for more advantages than they had secured already. \"I wish your assurance that if there is any trouble, you will be willing to send your troops to quell any uprising that we may have to deal with.\"\n \"You\u0027ll have to arrange that with Chrysanthos; I will abide by the terms you make with him,\" said Belisarius.\n The other men did what they could to get their companion to leave with them, speaking a few words in low voices urging him to come with them to this new officer.\n \"If we are not satisfied, you will learn of it,\" said the oldest delegate as he left the room.\n \"I\u0027m certain of that,\" said Belisarius, watching the door even when it was empty, as if aware of a lingering presence like an odor or the echo of a scream.\n Text of a letter to Vigilius, Bishop of Roma and Pope of the Church.\n On the anniversary of the election of Your Holiness to the See of Santo Pietrus, the Priest Formosus of Ostia sends this report with the deepest faith and reverence.\n It has pleased Your Holiness to learn of the current state of the Church in her parent city of Roma, and it has fallen to this most unhappy of men to inform Your Holiness that the great devil and pagan Totila has made progress with his forces against this most venerable of all cities. It is his intent to tear the whole place down, or so he swears on his blasphemous gods. To this end, he has been harrying the merchants on the roads, stopping farmers bringing produce to the city, and attempting to cut the aqueducts that bring water to the people of Roma. All this has been seen and heard by many and is not the result of mere rumors and fears that are current with many of those still living within the walls of the city.\n It is of particular note that those who should be most stalwart in their duty—the religious of Roma—have fled in great numbers, and it would astonish me to find more than two hundred priests and monks in Roma to minister to the thousands of unfortunates who have remained faithful to their God and Roma.\n While there are many who look to the Byzantines to succor us before Totila can break through our defenses, Your Holiness must understand that it is only through their efforts that any semblance of defense has been maintained at the present, and it would not be unreasonable to prepare for worse to come, for although the great Belisarius brings his men to our aid, the force is smaller than the one that the Emperor of Constantinople promised to provide, and they are not as well-equipped as they had been represented to be. No one wishes to think of the ruin of this greatest of cities, but there can be little doubt that no matter how vigilant we are, there are many here who will suffer, and the city will not be spared entirely.\n I do not wish to make it appear that I am entirely without hope, for that would be a greater sin than the one the pagans intend to commit here. Yet I would be lax in my duty to you as a priest if I did not say it would be prudent to prepare for the worst, so that such things as sacred relics and objects of veneration may be hidden or otherwise protected from the possible ravages of the Ostrogothic warriors who are bent on destroying the city before the height of summer.\n Your Holiness would do well to fortify Monte Casino against the barbarians, and to make an official request of Belisarius to give you and your company the protection that was assured you by the Emperor Justinian more than three years ago. If the Church is to survive, it must have the aid and assistance of all who are devoted to Our Lord and His Church. Whether they are of Byzantium or of Roma, surely there can be no argument that the fate of Christianity is in the hands of those willing to take up the cause of Our Lord in the face of those who are determined to bring the Church and her city to their knees.\n What draws the pagans are the earthly treasures which have been stored up out of piety and devotion. But these are not the true riches of the Church, and while the pagans seek only silver and gold, they assault far more than walls to obtain it. If we fail to defend the outward gifts of the Church, it is only too likely that we will also fail to defend the spiritual ramparts as well. I pray every hour that none of this will come to pass, but while I pray, I seek out men of experience to aid in the earthly battle, and I admonish all I see to offer up their orisons to God and the Mother Maria for the salvation of our city and our souls.\n In all humility and faith, and with unswerving dedication to Your Holiness and our Church, I sign myself your most lowly Brother in Christ,\n Formosus\n Priest from Ostia\n currently with the Curia in Roma\n 2\n By late afternoon the first contingent of soldiers arrived, making camp around the old villa in fields and orchards that were just coming into blossom. For novelty the old baths were fired up and many of the men boisterously used them, marveling at the depravity of the old Romans with their passion for bathing.\n \"What do you think?\" Niklos Aulirios asked his owner as he stared out the windows at the camp that had grown up around them.\n From her writing desk, Olivia Clemens did not answer at first; she was putting the last touches on a writ of manumission for two more slaves. Only when she had affixed both her signature and her seal did she answer. \"What do I think about what?\"\n \"These Byzantines,\" her Greek majordomo replied. \"I\u0027m not sure they\u0027re better than the Ostrogoths.\"\n \"They are better because they don\u0027t intend to raze the city,\" she pointed out, rising and coming to join him at the window.\n \"But look at them. And you know what they have done to half the countryside. I realize that an army must eat, and that soldiers might not have the manners of saints, but that doesn\u0027t excuse the raiding and looting they\u0027ve done.\" He had folded his arms and was looking more stubborn than usual.\n \"I\u0027m not going to argue with you,\" said Olivia, faintly amused by his conduct. \"But this is not the first trouble we\u0027ve seen, is it?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-3.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
