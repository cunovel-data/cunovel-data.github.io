I am now going to strive to minimize the impact of your presence on my household.\" She gave him a brief, hard look, then turned and went down the hall. \"Zejhil!\" she shouted. \"I want you to come to my rooms!\"\\n\\n Most of the household slaves heard Olivia\u0027s order, and three of them took it upon themselves to find Zejhil for her, so that by the time the Tartar slave reached Olivia\u0027s apartments, she was worried that something more dreadful than the soldiers had happened to her mistress.\\n\\n Niklos returned a short while later accompanied not by Belisarius but by Captain Chrysanthos, who was visiting the General. \"He has authorization from Belisarius,\" said Niklos, who had already given Chrysanthos the benefit of his view of the situation.\\n\\n Captain Demitrios watched Chrysanthos open the document and listened while he read aloud the items that Olivia was suspected of having including a sizable list of banned books, several of which Niklos recognized as the volumes Olivia had found added to the ones in her shelves.\\n\\n \"This is quite an indictment, if it is accurate,\" Chrysanthos said when he had finished reading.\\n\\n \"There are those who have sworn that it is,\" said Captain Demitrios grimly.\\n\\n \"And if they are in error?\" Chrysanthos asked, adding, \"I am charged by General Belisarius to discover what will be done to anyone bringing false accusations against Olivia Clemens.\"\\n\\n \"I was not informed,\" said Captain Demitrios. \"It is not for me to know of that.\"\\n\\n \"Then perhaps you will be good enough to deliver this note from General Belisarius to the office of the Censor. As the great lady\u0027s sponsor, he is obligated to ask these things.\" It was one of Chrysanthos\u0027 gifts that he had a frank and open face, one that expressed good fellowship so easily that few noticed the acute, canny eyes that missed little.\\n\\n Captain Demitrios took the note and looked at the seal. \"I will report this to Panaigios when we return to the palace,\" he said, and was about to summon his men for the search when Chrysanthos detained him.\\n\\n \"I fear that the General has charged me with requiring you to deliver this to Kimon Athanatadies himself. You will do that, will you not?\" He waited until the Captain agreed.\\n\\n The search lasted until after sunset; in the end the soldiers carried away three ivory-inlaid chairs, two jeweled ikons, an antique table, a tall Egyptian lyre, four leather-bound books, two bolts of linen, and a marble portrait bust made more than three hundred years before of a man Olivia called her oldest friend.\\n\\n \"Things of value are always suspect,\" Olivia said to Captain Demitrios as he offered her a copy of the list of what had been removed. She made no attempt to hide her bitterness.\\n\\n \"I will provide Captain Chrysanthos with a copy of this list; he can take it to General Belisarius.\" Captain Demitrios paused awkwardly. \"It is true that the General is not in favor now, but there are those who first served under him, and we do not like to see the way in which he is treated. I am sorry that this new disgrace had to come to him, after all the other slights and indignities he has had to endure. You will tell him that, will you not?\"\\n\\n \"I?\" Olivia asked. \"Or would you prefer that Chrysanthos tell him?\"\\n\\n \"It… He is your sponsor and we have taken things from your house, which he is responsible for, and it is—\" He looked toward Chrysanthos. \"Can you explain this to her?\"\\n\\n \"I cannot explain it to myself,\" Chrysanthos said without losing his cordial manner. \"I am hoping that the Censor will be able to.\"\\n\\n The Captain of the Guard took the note as if he expected it to burst into flame. \"I will deliver this. What the Censor will have to say, I cannot guess.\"\\n\\n \"He will tell you that it was necessary to do this,\" said Olivia. \"And if it is done, then leave my house. My slaves are upset, I am upset, and you have taken some of my most treasured possessions on the pretext that they are dangerous.\" She indicated the door.\\n\\n \"The Emperor demands—\" Captain Demitrios began, but Chrysanthos indicated the door.\\n\\n \"It is late, Captain, and there is not going to be a satisfactory justification of these seizures now. You have done what you had to do. It would be best if you departed with your men.\" He saw a quick gesture of approval from Niklos.\\n\\n Captain Demitrios did not cavil. \"I will see to your requests as if they came from Belisarius himself.\" He saluted Chrysanthos and left, signaling his troops to come with him as he strode away from the house.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re nothing more than brigands with permission!\" Olivia accused the closed door.\\n\\n \"If you had said that to Captain Demitrios, he would have had to report it to the Censor, and that would have given him the excuse to summon you for formal questioning. I don\u0027t think that you want that to happen.\" Chrysanthos looked at her, waiting for her to master her temper. \"I know that Drosos would not want that to happen.\"\\n\\n She turned to him. \"Drosos.\"\\n\\n \"You know what he has been like…\" Chrysanthos said, his aplomb deserting him for the first time that day. \"There has been nothing either I or Belisarius could say that consoles him. You are the only one. If I felt no obligation to you, I feel one to him, and I do not want you to fall into the hands of the Censor while Drosos is in such trouble.\"\\n\\n Niklos indicated the hall toward the rear of the house. \"I will see about getting the slaves fed. That is if Urania and Xanthos are not wholly overwhelmed by what\u0027s happened.\" He put his hand on Olivia\u0027s shoulder briefly. \"Listen to the man, Olivia. He has good sense and he knows this place. You are a stranger here.\"\\n\\n She closed her eyes in acknowledgment. \"I will try,\" she said to her bondsman, and once he was gone, she indicated the smaller of the reception rooms. \"Will you sit? I think there are enough chairs left for that.\"\\n\\n Chrysanthos\u0027 easy smile had deserted him. \"That was unforgivable. I will tell Belisarius to petition for the return of your goods at once.\"\\n\\n Olivia looked weary as she sat down on the padded bench. \"I have asked for permission to leave Konstantinoupolis; did you know? So far I\u0027ve been refused, but I have continued to request permission.\"\\n\\n \"But where would you go? You cannot return to Roma, or Italy, for that matter.\"\\n\\n \"There are other places. I have a few friends left in the world and there are places I could go.\" She paused. \"If you want something from the kitchen it might take a while to get it, but you are more than welcome.\"\\n\\n He waved her offer aside. \"There\u0027s no need. You have enough to do without worrying about me. But you sidestepped an answer, great lady. Where would you go?\"\\n\\n Olivia took a long breath. \"I have thought I might go to Ptolemais. I have not visited Africa for a long time.\"\\n\\n \"The Copts are strong there,\" Chrysanthos pointed out.\\n\\n \"That doesn\u0027t worry me.\" She saw he was shocked and she said, \"Your Orthodox ways are not Roman ways, no matter how hard everyone tries to deny it. The Church I… grew up with is not the same as the Church you have here. You are all Christians, but the… emphasis is different.\"\\n\\n \"But the Copts are heretics,\" Chrysanthos said.\\n\\n \"For a sensible man, Captain, you have a few blind spots—as we all do. It doesn\u0027t matter to me that there are Copts in Ptolemais; it is not likely that my friend\u0027s house there will be searched and looted.\"\\n\\n \"Looted is quite an accusation.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, very selectively looted, I\u0027ll give you that, but looted nonetheless, and in such a way that my objections place me in a worse position than complying with what the soldiers have done.\" The ire was back in her voice at last and she slammed her fist into the padded seat of the bench. \"I wanted to fight them. I wanted to take one of the swords out of the stable, or the heaviest plumbatae I have and beat them, hurt them, for what they were doing.\"\\n\\n Chrysanthos held up a hand in warning. \"It isn\u0027t wise to say so, no matter how deeply you feel it, for there are times when such statements are repeated.\" He realized he had alarmed her, and he went on in a softer tone, \"I will say nothing. I would not speak of what you say, for I am here as the deputy of your sponsor. I would not repeat your words, in any case, for the friendship I bear to Drosos.\"\\n\\n Her expression softened. \"You\u0027re almost a Roman in some things, Chrysanthos. I thought Belisarius and Drosos were the only ones, but you…\" She reached out and picked up a small, bronze rushlight in the shape of a winged serpent. \"I\u0027m a little surprised they left this to me. I don\u0027t think they knew its value or they might have wanted it. It\u0027s Persian, very old.\" As she held it out, she said, \"Take it, please, as a token of my thanks.\"\\n\\n Chrysanthos was startled. \"Great lady, you have no reason to do this.\"\\n\\n \"But I do,\" she corrected him gently. \"You performed a great service for me and you\u0027ve been willing to do more than you were required to do. Take the rushlight. You can use it as an oil lamp if you have a bronzeworker alter it a little.\"\\n\\n \"I would not think of changing it,\" said Chrysanthos as he took the rushlight. \"I am… very, very grateful, great lady. I never thought you would make such an offer.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-70.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \\n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
