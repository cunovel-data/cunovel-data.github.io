{"id":107715,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\\n\\n As to volumes that could be considered questionable, there is a text in Persian, which I am told my master does not speak but which Andros reads well, on the practical treatment of wounds in battle and at field stations. The entire purpose of the work is to provide those reading it with methods to limit the damage of bleeding, broken bones, deep injuries and infection. Andros has said that the master has looked at it from time to time and once declared that it was superior in the matter of herbs for packing fresh wounds. If there are other reasons for this interest, I do not know what they are, nor do I imagine that they are significant.\\n\\n There are three books in Latin on the breeding and training of horses, with emphasis on quality of bones and hooves as compared to speed. Since General Belisarius has often expressed his opinions on the quality and condition of the horses he has purchased it is not surprising that he would keep this in his records, though the Censor has declared that the nature of the material covered is not fitting for a true Christian to read. It is my belief that if the General were aware of this, he would find less offensive texts in regard to horses.\\n\\n The Censor has indicated that books originating in the lands east of the Black Sea are especially questionable, and it is my understanding that there are four books in the library that were brought along the Old Silk Road, although I do not know which was their place of origin, nor have I been able to locate such volumes, although Andros has told me that they do exist and that they are valued by our master in that they have to do with the various methods of battle used by peoples inhabiting the lands that the Old Silk Road traverses. It is his opinion that he must be prepared to counter every possible attack, and for that reason he has actively sought out all material he can find on the subject of war and its conduct. He has prided himself on discovering more material than most of those other officers of his rank who serve the Emperor. Since I do not know which these are and if I did, I would not know how to study what they say, I can only take the word of Andros and repeat to you what I have been told.\\n\\n There are six Egyptian books, very ancient, on fortifications and the methods of siege which General Belisarius has had occasion to show to me in the past, and which I have asked Andros to indicate. I am aware that these are regarded as being more questionable than some of the others because of the heretical practices of the Egyptians who claim to be Christians. Since these texts are said to be older than the coming of the Lord, then it would seem to me that most of what they say is not so much colored by the vile distortions of the Egyptians as we know them today, but far more the product of the old Egyptians, who were the ones who held the people of Moses and so terribly abused the captive Israelites during the time they were made slaves of the Pharaoh Emperors, and this I can well imagine might be detrimental to true faith. Upon your order I will have these volumes removed and brought to you for examination and review so that any heresy that might have been taught in these writings may be identified and its influence expunged.\\n\\n In devotion of purpose, I am always at your service and the service of the Empire which all of us, including my master, serve.\\n\\n By my own hand\\n\\n Simones\\n\\n slave of the General Belisarius\\n\\n 11\\n\\n It was a sullen morning, with enormous dark clouds piling up over the water and crowding over the city. The air was heavy with them; the streets felt their weight.\\n\\n Three Guards surrounded Niklos Aulirios as they made their way through the breathless silence toward the grounds of the palace. They had said little since they presented themselves at Olivia\u0027s house, but it had been enough to fill the majordomo with gnawing fear.\\n\\n \"This is the bonded servant of the Roman woman,\" announced the oldest of the Guards as they brought him to one of the side gates in the palace walls.\\n\\n \"He is expected; bring him.\" The lavishly dressed eunuchs led the way into the palace, apparently taking delight in finding the darkest and most twisting corridors to reach their destination, and when they arrived at the vaulted room with an ikonostasis at both ends, they indicated the Guards should remain.\\n\\n \"It is always uncertain when one questions a foreigner,\" said the largest eunuch in a high, shrill voice.\\n\\n \"My name is Niklos Aulirios,\" he said a little too loudly. \"My name is Greek.\"\\n\\n \"And you admit that you have lived in Roma since you were a boy, and that you have no sense of being Greek,\" said the eunuch bluntly. \"It is fitting that we speak with you before we extend our inquiries to your mistress.\"\\n\\n Niklos fell silent at once, his mind working furiously as he tried to think of some way in which to warn Olivia. He dreaded what the next hour would bring and he could think of no way to divert the attention of the Censor from her. He lowered his head and took up the position he knew the Censor\u0027s staff would regard as prayer.\\n\\n \"It will not be long. If you are seeking solace, your prayers had better be short ones.\" That was the second eunuch, who had a face so beautiful that it was a shame it was wasted on him and not given to a girl.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Niklos with outward humility and concealed anger. \"I have faith that God will hear my petition no matter how brief it may be.\"\\n\\n \"Indeed.\" The second eunuch exchanged glances with his colleague. Both nodded once and the younger one stepped up close behind Niklos. \"What do you pray for?\"\\n\\n \"Compassion,\" he said. \"Deliverance.\"\\n\\n \"Deliverance? From the Court Censor who is the devoted son of the Church?\" mocked the eunuch, his horror tinged with malign glee.\\n\\n \"No, deliverance from my enemies and the enemies of my mistress,\" Niklos said, doing his best to keep his anger under control, remembering the many times he had given way to it and had bitterly regretted doing so later.\\n\\n \"What enemies does a simple majordomo have?\" asked the larger eunuch.\\n\\n \"I do not know; that is why I pray to God to deliver me from them since it would appear there is nothing I can do alone.\" He kept his head bowed over his hands.\\n\\n \"There is nothing we can do alone, ever. They teach you heresy in Roma, you Roman with a Greek name.\" The larger eunuch cocked his head to the side and regarded Niklos with expectant patience. \"Is your mistress similarly misled?\"\\n\\n \"I do not speak of faith to my mistress,\" said Niklos, holding himself more rigorously in check.\\n\\n \"Too presumptuous? It might save her soul, and what then? Does not the welfare of her soul exceed the bounds of propriety?\" The smaller eunuch was definitely enjoying himself now, goading Niklos with practiced ease.\\n\\n \"If I could be certain that what I had been taught of salvation was utterly true and that my understanding of it was perfect and my explanation of it was completely clear and without error on my part in telling of it and without error in what was heard, then I would not let the limitations of propriety keep me from addressing anyone, my mistress, any pope, the Emperor himself, with what I knew. But my knowledge is imperfect and I do not speak with the tongues of angels, and so I will remain as I am and strive to learn more that one day I might come to such understanding, if it is the will of God that I do.\" He wanted to rail at them, to accuse them of harassing him and his mistress, of conduct so improper that everyone would be disgusted if they knew of it, but that would only serve to put him in greater danger, as well as causing Olivia more distress than what she suffered already. He bowed his head and added, \"I therefore must commend myself to God and the Holy Spirit and pray that they will read what is in my heart since I doubt I can speak it clearly enough for you to comprehend it.\"\\n\\n \"Humility, and from a Roman,\" marveled the larger eunuch.\\n\\n \"From a Greek bondsman,\" corrected the other. \"You can tell he\u0027s Greek by the eloquence.\"\\n\\n One of the Guards giggled.\\n\\n \"Greek or Roman, I observe the dictates of Christianity,\" said Niklos sharply.\\n\\n \"Curious wording,\" observed the smaller eunuch. \"He observes the dictates of Christianity. He does not profess his faith.\"\\n\\n \"That is something that only God can know,\" said Niklos. \"I do what I can to live as a good Christian lives, I strive to do evil to none and to aid those I can, I pray for guidance, but does that make me a Christian? Not if what I have been taught is true, and only the state of my soul—which I cannot know, being a man—reveals whether or not I am Christian.\" He decided he had better not continue this argument, or he might be regarded with more hostility for daring to interpret Christianity and its teachings.\\n\\n \"Very facile,\" said the smaller eunuch. \"They are great politicians in Roma, aren\u0027t they? I hear that the Bishop of Roma has regular debates on doctrine, as if that were required of the popes of the Church.\"\\n\\n \"I am not privy to what the Bishop of Roma does or does not do,\" Niklos said. \"I listen to the priest who preaches, or who preached at the villa of my mistress, and from that I try to gain understanding.\"\\n\\n \"And favor?\" suggested the larger eunuch.\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t aware that such was the purpose of being a Christian, except the favor of God.\" It was a sharper answer than he had given before and as soon as he said it, he knew he had overstepped the bounds. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-29.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \\n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
