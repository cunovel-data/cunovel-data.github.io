What do we do?\"\\n\\n Niklos came and put his hands on her shoulders. \"This was supposed to be a haven.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said sadly. \"It was, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Text of a letter from the physician Mnenodatos to Belisarius.\\n\\n To the great General Belisarius, Mnenodatos sends thankful greetings and prayers for his well-being and the recovery of his wife.\\n\\n I confess that your offer of employment has come as a shock: most pleasant and welcome, but nonetheless a shock. I am at a loss to know how so distinguished a hero as you came to know of a physician of my station, but I bless the name of that person and I praise him for taking my interests so much to heart.\\n\\n It would afford me the greatest satisfaction to attend your wife and to serve as your household physician. Such employment is the dream of any man practicing the healing arts, and I am no different from any of my associates and colleagues who also long for the time they can be sure of their futures.\\n\\n From what little I have learned of your wife\u0027s condition, she will require fairly constant care. Those with such symptoms are never certain when they will once again be seized by the terrible cramping that you described and which I witnessed for myself yesterday. I certainly share your concern. To be candid, I am not sure there is much I can offer to relieve her of her suffering, but what I am able to do, you may be confident I will make every effort to do. In cases such as hers it is most important to alleviate the immediate suffering, but beyond that the cause must be determined and a course of treatment reached that will not in any way increase the symptoms of this or any other disease.\\n\\n Let me urge you to encourage all your household to pray for the speedy and complete recovery of your beloved wife, for as you are aware, nothing can happen without the aid of God. Such supplications may succeed where no medicine can.\\n\\n That is not to say that the case is hopeless and only the intervention of Heaven will save Antonina. This is far from the case; your wife\u0027s health is not good but she is not in danger of losing her life yet, and with prompt action and good attention, she may recover in good time and enjoy a long life free of pain and attendant distresses. Let me emphasize this to you: at this time I do not fear for her life. To be sure, if she continues as she is going now, then my view of the gravity of her case will change, and of course no illness that so prostrates a woman can be regarded lightly, but there is much room for hope and I want you to think of my treatment in this light.\\n\\n It is a great honor to have so distinguished a patient, but I trust you will not be offended in any way if I say that it would please me far more if there was no cause for us to meet. The illness of Antonina is not an opportunity for advancement, as many might see it, but an occasion for the best and most devoted service not only to the benefit of the august lady herself, but the office of physician which was elevated by having the Apostle Loukas at the head of its numbers.\\n\\n At your convenience I will take up temporary residence in your house in whatever quarters you see fit to assign to me. I confess I do not know your eunuch slave Simones, but if you say that his recommendation brought me to your attention, then I will seek him out eagerly to tender my gratitude for his kindness on my behalf.\\n\\n In the meantime, I ask you take what consolation you can in the knowledge that I will dedicate all my skills to ending the travail your wife currently endures, and I will strive to restore her health so that she may once again live as so august a lady ought to live.\\n\\n With my prayers and thanks, by my own hand,\\n\\n Mnenodatos\\n\\n physician\\n\\n 8\\n\\n Night hung over Alexandria, oppressive in its remoteness. There was a lazy breeze off the Mare Internum, blowing toward the swath of the Nile.\\n\\n Drosos stood in the window of his largest reception room staring out into the darkness. Although it was late, he was still in his short military dalmatica and formal, highly embossed lorica. Only his mussed dark hair gave any indication of the distress that consumed him: it was the Feast of the Circumcision and Epiphany was five days away.\\n\\n \"Captain?\" Chrysanthos had come into the room a short while before and was still waiting for Drosos to address him.\\n\\n \"I know,\" Drosos said distantly, not leaving the window.\\n\\n \"The Guard is waiting.\" Chrysanthos kept his words level and without feeling but this served only to mask his deep concern for his superior. \"You requested they accompany you.\"\\n\\n Drosos nodded, his broad back rigid under his ceremonial armor.\\n\\n \"It is after midnight,\" Chrysanthos said as tactfully as he could.\\n\\n \"The nights are long,\" Drosos remarked inconsequentially.\\n\\n \"It is the dark of the year,\" Chrysanthos agreed, staring at the whitewashed walls, noting the smudges above the braziers.\\n\\n \"The Copts are fasting tonight and tomorrow. They do not feast until Epiphany.\" He said the last word as if it were gall.\\n\\n \"Yes; I know.\"\\n\\n \"They say it\u0027s heretical of them.\" He stopped talking, his eyes fixed on the large buildings that loomed out of the jumble of darknesses that was the city. \"God,\" he whispered. \"He does not know what he is asking.\"\\n\\n Chrysanthos suddenly found it difficult to speak. \"Drosos. If it is so unendurable—\"\\n\\n \"I am Captain here,\" Drosos said in a still voice that silenced the other man. \"I have been given a command by the Emperor. I am sworn to carry it out.\"\\n\\n \"There are others who will do it if you give the word,\" Chrysanthos told Drosos, wishing that he would turn and face him.\\n\\n \"Would you!\" He asked it lightly but his hands closed into hard fists at his sides.\\n\\n Chrysanthos hesitated. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"You are the Emperor\u0027s officer, as I am.\" He looked up at the remote stars. \"They say God watches the stars as He watches men, to the end of the world.\" Under the metal of his lorica his chest was aching.\\n\\n \"Your escort—\" Chrysanthos reminded him.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" At last he turned away from the window and his face was blank with suffering. He crossed the room to Chrysanthos. \"I am ready.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re in the courtyard. Four of them, armed.\" Chrysanthos looked closely at Drosos, seeing how much he had changed from the man he knew on campaign in Italy. \"Are you all right, Captain?\"\\n\\n Drosos met Chrysanthos\u0027 eyes. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Is there—\"\\n\\n \"No. Nothing.\" Drosos moved past him, walking directly and purposefully to the door. He stopped there, and said without looking at Chrysanthos, \"If you want to leave, I understand.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Chrysanthos said, longing to take advantage of the offer. \"I will remain here for the time being.\"\\n\\n \"Um.\" Drosos nodded, unable to express the painful gratitude he felt at his subordinate\u0027s loyalty. \"When I return… share a skin of wine with me.\"\\n\\n \"If you like,\" Chrysanthos said carefully, thinking that he had never needed to guard his tongue as much as he did now.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll need a drink by then,\" Drosos said, and left the room. As he descended the stairs to the ground floor, he tried to calm his thoughts. He was the Emperor\u0027s officer and he had orders to carry out and there was nothing more to be said. He walked more quickly as he approached the escort waiting in the courtyard. \"Let\u0027s get this over with,\" he told them as he strode to the door, letting them scramble to keep up with him.\\n\\n The streets were almost empty and those few, furtive men who saw the soldiers hurried away from them, wanting nothing to do with anyone from the Byzantine garrison. Neither Drosos nor his Guard paid any attention to the others, going quickly to the enormous buildings Drosos had watched from his window.\\n\\n Two Greek scholars waited for Drosos at the gates to the Library, and they admitted him with deference.\\n\\n \"You are most welcome,\" the younger said to Drosos.\\n\\n \"Am I?\" Drosos asked, his words brittle and light. \"Well, I will strive to remember that.\"\\n\\n The older scholar regarded Drosos with curiosity and puzzlement. \"Captain?\"\\n\\n \"Pay no mind to what I say,\" Drosos told them. \"It\u0027s late and I want to get this settled as soon as possible. I must send a full report to the Censor before we… before we start the fires.\"\\n\\n \"May God aid our endeavors,\" said the younger, pious ardor in his face. \"This has been a long time coming. If the vision of the Emperor is to be fulfilled, we must see that temptation is expunged from the world so that we may better serve the cause of Heaven.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Of course.\" Drosos motioned to his four Guards to remain at the gates. \"Show me…\"He was not able to finish his request.\\n\\n Neither scholar appeared to notice this. \"Yes, there is much to see,\" said the older. \"If you will follow us, I will be pleased to explain this place to you.\"\\n\\n \"If you would,\" Drosos said, trying to be polite. He let the two scholars lead the way into the largest of the four buildings that surrounded the vast central courtyard.\\n\\n \"This,\" said the younger as they approached the largest building, \"is called the Mother. It is the oldest of the libraries and was built in the time before the birth of the Christ. It has two warehouses where materials not yet catalogued are stored. We have already determined that what is in them is not Christian, and so we need have no reluctance about burning them along with the Library itself.\" He stepped aside so that Drosos could enter ahead of them. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-53.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \\n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
