{"id":107770,"no":84,"title":"Page 84","content":"\"In effect, this miserable man has been offered a bribe if he will speak against me,\" said Olivia, turning toward Captain Vlamos. \"What do you think of this, Captain Vlamos? You have heard the allegations and you say nothing.\" \"It\u0027s not for me to say, one way or another. I am here to carry out the commands of the Censor, his officers, and the commands of the Emperor.\" He spoke woodenly, and he refused to look at Olivia. \"Tell me,\" Olivia said, addressing Panaigios, \"when you questioned my bondsman, did anything he said cause you to think that I might be as sinister a person as this… this pope has said?\" \"Your bondsman is your bondsman.\" Konstantos would not permit Panaigios to answer. \"And your witness is demented,\" Olivia said, her control slipping away. She dug her nails into the palms of her hands and concentrated on the pain in order to master herself. \"My bondsman has served me many years. He—if he were allowed to speak here, which he is not—might tell you otherwise. I admit I know some of the lore of herbs, as do most owners of villas in the country. Your own citizens probably have similar supplies, and for similar reasons. If you have decided that this is significant, there are many, much closer to the Emperor and the Censor, who must share suspicion with me.\" She thought, as she said it, that she might have inadvertently touched on the truth. \"You are being questioned now,\" Konstantos shouted. \"And you are not permitted to speak.\" \"Then send for my sponsor and let him know of your suspicions. Or would that interfere?\" Olivia got to her feet again. \"Belisarius is required by law to be present if there are formal charges laid against me, since he is responsible for me. Yet you refuse to send for him. Therefore you are not making formal charges. Or if you are making formal charges, you do so illegally.\" She looked at the three men in turn. \"You need to find someone to blame, and I am safest, for I have no family and I am a foreign woman. How convenient that I also have money that you will be entitled to claim.\" She turned to Captain Vlamos. \"Well?\" \"I must not speak with you, great lady,\" the Captain said in some embarrassment. \"Don\u0027t these proceedings seem irregular to you?\" When she received no answer from him, she went on, \"I know from Belisarius himself that you are considered an honorable soldier. I ask you now to inform him or my bondsman of what has taken place here, so that one or the other of them may begin to seek remedy for this… this travesty.\" She gave her attention to Konstantos once more. \"That is part of your purpose, isn\u0027t it? You want to find someone guilty for the death of Antonina so that there will be no more questions about it. You think that if you accuse me, Belisarius will ask nothing about me, and you will never have to answer for your acts.\" She wondered if perhaps Konstantos had guessed correctly, and Belisarius, overcome with grief, would refuse to pursue her interests. \"I have heard too much from you,\" Konstantos said in a low, deadly tone. \"You have been permitted more leeway because as a Roman we know you do not understand proper conduct. We will enter the testimony of Pope Sylvestros in our records, and we will send all to Belisarius for him to reply to the accusations. But you, you are to be detained until it is decided that there are grounds enough to review your case.\" He slapped the tabletop. \"O Lord, You strike in wrath and in thunder,\" intoned Pope Sylvestros, his hands pressed together. \"I listen and I hear the sound of Your destruction promised to the sinful world.\" \"Make him be quiet!\" Konstantos shouted, rounding on Panaigios, who had dropped the vellum sheets he held. \"I… I…\" Panaigios began, then said nothing more as he pulled on Pope Sylvestros\u0027 arm in a futile attempt to get his attention. \"The thunder of destruction and the thunder of creation fill all Heaven and shake the earth,\" Pope Sylvestros exulted. \"The tread of the Lord shakes the world and the cities fall before Him.\" \"If it is proven that you are a sorceress,\" Konstantos went on, doing his best to ignore Pope Sylvestros, \"then you will be tied in a sack and thrown in the sea, which is the fate of all sorcerers and sorceresses.\" \"Tied in a sack and thrown in the sea,\" Olivia repeated with fascination and horror. Water would not kill her, and she could not drown, but she would be immobilized until her flesh gave way or she was eaten. And for however long that took, she would be conscious. \"You condemn me to Hell,\" she said softly, with great feeling, for to her it was no more than the truth. \"It is your action that condemns you to Hell,\" said Konstantos with satisfaction, misunderstanding her. \"We are only instruments of the Emperor who seeks to emulate God on earth with wisdom and judgment.\" \"That might be thought prideful,\" Olivia said in a thoughtful voice. \"And as I recall, pride is a sin.\" \"You are not one to speak against the Emperor or the Lord God,\" Konstantos warned Olivia. He was about to go on when another man entered the room and approached him. Both Panaigios and Konstantos made a reverence to Kimon Athanatadies, and Panaigios held out the list of charges that he had read earlier. The Court Censor took the sheet and looked over them. \"Atta Olivia Clemens,\" he said. \"I recall we have had some questions about her. Sorcery. A grave charge.\" He looked at Pope Sylvestros. \"Who is that?\" \"A witness.\" Panaigios had the grace to look chagrined at this admission. \"He is Pope Sylvestros.\" \"I recall that name. He has been shown to have committed criminal acts.\" Athanatadies tapped the edge of the sheet. \"I trust that he is not your only witness.\" The cold expression in the Censor\u0027s eyes subdued Konstantos\u0027 zeal. \"We are trying to find others. We have information from those who cannot testify, and in time we will obtain access to those who can.\" \"See that you do,\" said Athanatadies. \"I must defend every decision made by my staff to the Emperor.\" He stared blankly at the far wall. \"The Emperor is determined to root out all wrongdoing in the Empire. We are mandated to act for him. But if we abuse his authority, then we are culpable.\" He slid his fingers over his moist palms. \"Have care that you do not exceed your authority, Konstantos. And you as well, Panaigios. If you do, you will have to answer for it.\" He handed the vellum back to Panaigios and looked toward Olivia. \"Where is your sponsor, woman?\" \"That is a question I have been asking since I was brought here, Censor,\" Olivia answered with asperity. \"Her sponsor is Belisarius and there is reason to think that this woman poisoned the General\u0027s wife,\" Konstantos said, not quite defiantly. \"Is that any reason not to have him here?\" Athanatadies asked, thinking what Justinian might require under these circumstances. \"He should be sent for.\" \"At once?\" Panaigios said. \"How do we explain to him?\" Konstantos said at the same time. Athanatadies did not want to make any more decisions; he had been upbraided for the last two and he was afraid of the Emperor\u0027s demands. He stared in silence at a place on the floor about halfway between him and Olivia. At last he said, \"Detain her.\" \"What?\" Olivia cried out, her reserve gone. \"By what right do you \u0027detain\u0027 me?\" She did not want to be kept in a cell again, lost to the world and conveniently forgotten. This had happened to her in the past, and in many ways it was worse than awakening in her tomb. In a cell, she had become ravenous, not only for blood but for intimacy, for the exchange that satisfied more than simple hunger. \"By right as the Court Censor,\" said Athanatadies, his expression rigid. \"You have been accused of serious acts. Until we have more to support these accusations, I remand you into the custody of Captain Vlamos. There are quarters in this building for those accused whose cases are being investigated; we maintain them for such as you.\" He studied Olivia for a little while. \"It will not be too unpleasant, if that is what troubles you.\" \"Locked up and isolated is always unpleasant, Censor,\" she said with hard intent. \"The trappings—\" She shrugged. \"There is the dungeon, if you prefer,\" Konstantos offered, gloating. Olivia ignored him, keeping her attention on Kimon Athanatadies. \"You will see that my sponsor is notified of your investigation and the charges against me.\" \"Yes; in due time.\" He cleared his throat and moved away from her. \"When is this \u0027due time\u0027 you speak of?\" Olivia asked, making no attempt to disguise her sarcasm. \"It is when it is,\" Athanatadies said without looking around, and spoke next to Konstantos and Panaigios. \"I want to be kept abreast of your findings. Do not think you are being excused from your work here. Something must be found, something more than that disgusting pope. He would be unreliable at best.\" \"Yes, Censor,\" said Konstantos. \"We will continue our work.\" \"And see that you find testimony from those who can give it; the gossip of slaves will not be welcome, even as supporting reports. Slaves always think ill of foreign masters, and you know that as well as I do.\" He started toward his side door, then turned back. \"You may be sure that Belisarius will begin asking questions in a few days. You had better have some answers. He may be in disgrace with the Emperor, but he is still a General and he has some authority.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-84.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
