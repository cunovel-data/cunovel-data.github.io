I know of no reason I cannot report this to you without harming my master. Rest assured that I will reveal all I learn of this to you whenever you wish to know of it.\"\n The two men regarded each other with new understanding. \"So,\" said Panaigios, drawing out the word.\n \"Very well; for a start you will report to me everyone who comes and goes from the house. You will tell me what they say and to whom, why they come and where they go when they leave. Find out what it is they want from Belisarius and his wife, and what they are offering for what they want. It is important that we learn these things.\"\n \"Important?\" said Simones. \"For them as well as my master.\"\n \"If you continue to think that Belisarius is blameless, you may discover that there is more than enough guilt in others to implicate him in some way. Do not withhold information from me or it might be impossible for me to continue to protect you, and once your master learns of your conduct, wellâ€”\"\n Simones nodded. \"Of course. And you are in a position to deny anything I might claim.\" He accepted this with relief. He knew now that he would have to be careful in all that he did.\n \"You are not unintelligent, slave, and you are dedicated. All that is required of you is that you maintain your dedication but to a higher purpose.\" He indicated the door. \"My slave will see you out. He will tell you when you will be admitted to the courtyard for your reports.\"\n For a moment, Simones stared contemptuously at Panaigios, then changed his demeanor so that he was once again submissive. \"I am in your hands, secretary of the Censor. You can shape my destiny as God controls the fate of Man.\"\n \"That could be considered blasphemy,\" said Panaigios, but there was a degree of delight in the warning.\n \"For a churchman, perhaps, but for a slave?\" He stepped back and opened the door. \"I will report to you soon, Panaigios, and whatever I tell you will be the truth. I care not what you do with it so long as you do not throw me to the .storm.\"\n \"I can\u0027t afford to do that, in any case,\" admitted Panaigios. \"You will come to believe that in time. Once you do, we will deal together much more effectively.\"\n Simones made him a deep reverence that bordered on insult. \"I await the opportunity to serve,\" he said, and left before Panaigios could say anything more.\n The Egyptian slave glared at Simones, but handed him a slip of parchment with a few instructions scribbled on it. \"You will receive the other items when you make your first report. Until then you must restrain yourself.\"\n \"I understand,\" muttered Simones. He was ready to argue with the Egyptian, but was not given the chance. Almost at once there was a household slave waiting to escort him to the main gate, and then the Captain of the Guard to send him on his way.\n As he walked back to the house of Belisarius, Simones let his mind have free rein. He was determined to turn all that he had learned to his advantage. Plots and posturing, he told himself, could be made to serve his ends as well as anyone else\u0027s. But for this he would need an ally, someone who could share his risk. It would be useless to speak to Antonina, for if she ever discovered what he was doing, she would have him flogged to death without hesitation. It had to be someone close to her, someone who would listen to him. There were the two widows, and one of them might be what he wanted. Eugenia was Byzantine, and that was a tremendous advantage. She knew how the power moved and who moved it, and she was greedy for it, he could tell from her eyes. If not Eugenia, then that Roman woman, the widow Olivia might have to be used, but Simones was uncertain about her. She was too foreign and had too much power for him to be able to manipulate her as he would like.\n A cart drawn by a single ox trundled by and Simones had to step to the far side of the road to avoid being injured. He called the might of heaven down on the drover\u0027s head, then resumed his progress along the noisy streets.\n As he neared the house of Belisarius, he made up his mind: he would approach Eugenia first, striving to convince her that he could give her power and an access to position that he did not currently have. He liked her better than Olivia in any case, for he could sense her rapacity, and he trusted it. He did not know what it was that Olivia longed for, and was not willing to take the risks he would have to take in order to find out.\n He entered the house by the side door and was informed that Antonina was waiting to speak with him, for she required his help in planning her next gathering. It was a simple matter, he decided, to make sure he remained an essential part of the household. It would satisfy both Antonina and Panaigios, which in turn would eventually satisfy Simones himself.\n A letter from Pope Sylvestros to the Bishop of the Church of the Patriarchs.\n To the most reverend, sanctified and august superiors and the Bishop, Pope Sylvestros submits this most humble request on the Evangelical Feast in the Lord\u0027s Year 546.\n From my prayers and other devotions, it has come to me that there are those in Italy who yearn for the consolation of true religion, and who toil under the burdens of war and apostasy. For that reason, I am petitioning you to permit me to travel to Italy to undertake the comfort of these unfortunates. It is not unlikely that I will remain some time among those who need me, and who will be grateful to have the opportunity to find the solace of faith.\n I am known to several of the sea captains who ply the waters between here and Ostia, and it would not be a great difficulty for me to secure passage with one or another of them. This will make my travels of little cost to the Church as well as providing yet another chance for me to reach those who are usually deprived of the offices of faith, for the captains would permit me to preach to the crew and anyone traveling with them to Italy.\n We have heard of the losses and disgraces suffered by our troops facing the forces of Totila, and it may be that the presence of one of true religion might inspire courage and greater dedication among the soldiers so that they will be moved to battle with more determination for the saving of the city of Roma as well as the rest of the countryside.\n Whatever your decision, I bow my head to your wisdom and your choice, and I profess myself wholly accepting of anything you permit me to do.\n In the name of the Savior, the\n Father and the Sacred Spirit,\n Pope Sylvestros\n Church of the Patriarchs\n 7\n By sundown the heat of the day faded and the first slow night breeze moved over the Black Sea to Konstantin-oupolis, its light touch heralding the coming darkness. The voices of bells brazen as the western sky called a farewell to the sun; the shouts and bustle from the wharves and markets gave way to the drone of chants from the churches.\n For Drosos, this was the familiar rhythm of home, one that he noticed only because he had so recently returned from the chaos of Italy. That campaign was still fresh in his mind, and often he had to remind himself that it was behind him. One thing he treasured from Italy waited for him now; he smiled as he trod up the gentle hill to the house where Olivia lived. It was his second visit since his return to Konstantinoupolis three weeks ago, and this time he hoped that their meeting would be more than the formal ritual that society required. His memory burned from the three nights they had spent together at her villa outside the walls of Roma, and he hungered now for more of her.\n Niklos opened the door to him, saluting instead of making a reverence. \"Welcome back, Captain.\"\n Grinning, Drosos returned the salute. \"I am happy to be here, Niklos.\" He glanced around the vestibule and saw no sign of other guests. \"What company this evening?\"\n \"Just you, Captain,\" said Niklos with a knowing look.\n \"For the entire evening?\" He was a bit surprised at the majordomo\u0027s bluntness.\n \"For the entire evening,\" Niklos confirmed, adding, \"My mistress waits for you in the garden.\"\n \"Will you take me there?\" He could find his way himself, but it would be taking a liberty that could easily be thought a serious breach of good conduct. \"You, or one of the household slaves.\"\n \"I will take you,\" said Niklos, indicating the hallway they should use and following a pace behind Drosos.\n \"How is your mistress?\" Drosos inquired, attempting to keep the tone of the evening properly reserved.\n \"She misses you, Captain,\" said Niklos, his candor putting aside the practiced phrases that Drosos expected.\n \"I have missed her,\" said Drosos, aware that it was not correct for him to discuss Olivia with her bondsman.\n Niklos gave Drosos an understanding nod. \"You wonder that I should say this to you, that I know so much about my mistress? It is because I have been with Olivia Clemens for a long time, and as her bondsman and majordomo, I know many things about her. She confides in me and has done so for many years.\" They had passed the dining room and Niklos indicated the small supper laid out for the Captain. \"Refreshments are waiting for you whenever you wish for them.\"\n \"Not yet, I think,\" said Drosos, his appetite whetted for something other than food.\n \"No,\" agreed Niklos, and opened the door to the garden. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-17.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
