They took the livestock, not the treasure.\" He cleared his throat. \"There isn\u0027t much furniture; I think the owners must have removed some of it when they fled. There is some jewelry, and quite a lot of personal items, such as mirrors and perfume jars. I noticed some garments in a press; I don\u0027t think any of Totila\u0027s men knew enough to look there—\"\n \"Too personal. They might be identified,\" Ghornan said, dismissing them.\n \"There are two chariots, wood covered with brass, very fine looking. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s practical to take them both, but if you brought mules we could harness them to one of the chariots and use it to carry some of the heavier goods.\"\n \"Such as?\" said Ghornan, revising his contemptuous opinion of Pope Sylvestros a little.\n \"The wine stored under the kitchen floor, for example. Some of it was taken, but a great deal remains, most of it in good condition. The owner had an excellent collection. And who is to say who owns what bottle of wine?\" He held out the first page for Ghornan\u0027s review and studied the second one. \"This villa is not very promising, but there are one or two good paintings that might be removed. There is also a good-sized alabaster vase that could bring a very high price.\"\n \"Paintings are usually not worth much,\" said Ghornan, not interested. \"And they\u0027re easily identified.\"\n \"These are old, and one of them shows the destruction of the lost city of Pompeü under Vesuvius. That ought to make it worth more than paint.\" Pope Sylvestros ran his finger down the page a little farther. \"Here\u0027s something quite remarkable: three rosewood chests, all in good condition, one with brass platters in it. I found them behind the tack room in the stables; I guess the owners had intended to pack them and then changed their minds.\"\n \"That\u0027s more the kind of thing I\u0027m looking for,\" said Ghornan with a speculative smile. \"Chests, furniture, household goods of special quality and workmanship. The chariots are tempting, and I think that if we can find chests of good value, it might be worth a little extra.\" He tapped the table, his hands hard on the planking.\n \"There was one villa, then, east of the city. I understand that General Belisarius himself stayed there for a while. It was owned by one of those imposing Roman widows, and must have several fortunes, judging by what was left there. Even after Totila\u0027s men went through the place, I found many treasures left in it.\" He coughed. \"It is a little farther away than you said you wished to travel, but I think you\u0027d find it more than justifies the additional time and effort. I made a partial inventory, in case you thought you\u0027d like to risk it.\"\n \"You know what they\u0027re doing to looters in Roma these days?\" Ghornan asked. \"You saw the Ostrogoths on the walls coming in, didn\u0027t you? I\u0027d just as soon keep my hands and my skin, thank you.\" He glared at the smoke-blackened beams. \"It would have to be really special for me to take that kind of chance.\" With a speculative lift to his brow, he waited for Pope Sylvestros to speak. \"Well?\"\n \"Look at the list for yourself,\" said Pope Sylvestros, sliding two of the sheets toward him. \"Everything I found is catalogued here, and you may be sure that there is more. This is superficial. There were over two hundred volumes in the library, and she must have taken many more with her. Some of them were very old, and that might—\"\n \"Books are dangerous,\" Ghornan reminded him. \"No telling when they might be banned, and then they become more hazardous than a scorpion.\" He ran his finger down the page, his lips moving as he read. \"If this plum is so ripe, what makes you think that we\u0027ll be the only one after it?\"\n \"Most of the folk who live near the villa will not enter it for any reason. They say that it has a strange reputation. Even those who do not dislike it treat the place with the greatest respect. The owner was said to be a sybil, and some of the very old peasants insist that she had lived there since they were children.\" He paused. \"I could say prayers for the repose of unquiet spirits. If there are ghosts, they will depart.\"\n \"We Copts,\" Ghornan exclaimed indignantly, \"have better sense than to rely on ceremonies for all eventualities. You Byzantines have complicated worship until it is nothing more than a theatrical performance. Chalices and ikons!\" He stopped his tirade with an effort. \"Still, if you would rather exorcise the villa before we loot it, I will not deter you. If this place has one half the booty you show here, one industrious night might be worth everything. And if the peasants think that it is an unwholesome place, that could be to our advantage. They will attribute what we do to whatever demon they think lurks there, and we will not be hampered.\" He rubbed his chin. \"In fact, let us take care to make it appear that there are restless spirits there. No sense in making this more risky than necessary.\"\n \"And if there are such spirits?\" Pope Sylvestros could not resist asking.\n \"We are good Christians, aren\u0027t we?\" Ghornan asked. \"What have we to fear from the Devil? I\u0027d worry more about the owners\u0027 wrath than what Hell might do.\"\n Pope Sylvestros blessed himself. \"Apostasy,\" he muttered. \"You risk worse than anything the magistrates might sentence.\"\n \"And what of the owner?\" asked Captain Ghornan with elaborate courtesy. \"This widow, where is she and what will she think if we help ourselves to her treasures?\"\n \"She has left Italy. They say that she went to Constantinople, and perhaps she did. No matter.\" Pope Sylvestros waved his hand to show what a minor consideration she was. \"Even if we are found out, what can a Roman widow do to us? I know that her sponsor is a pope and he will not act against another member of the Church simply because a few of her things were taken.\"\n \"You\u0027re counting on a lot,\" grumbled Ghornan.\n \"No, I\u0027m not,\" said Pope Sylvestros with intensity. \"In the very unlikely event she discovers what has happened here, how can she trace this to us? All we have to say is that we bought the goods from a reputable merchant, and there\u0027s an end to it.\"\n \"You hope,\" said Ghornan at his most daunting. \"And if she can convince someone that something must be done, where does that leave us?\"\n \"Who might she convince?\" asked Pope Sylvestros with genuine bewilderment.\n \"You said that General Belisarius used the villa. She might persuade him that something is amiss. Let me tell you right now that I have no intention of getting on his wrong side. My work is much too dependent on his—\"\n Pope Sylvestros interrupted Ghornan with a conspiratorial smirk. \"Word has it that the General will not be in Italy much longer. The rumors are that the Emperor is displeased with the progress of the campaign and suspicious of Belisarius\u0027 motivations and is going to remove him shortly.\"\n \"I have heard those rumors; Belisarius is still here.\" Ghornan finished his wine. \"There are others who will be on watch for contraband of all sorts. This could be a trap for us; did you ever consider that?\"\n \"Yes, but I don\u0027t think so. There are palaces in Roma that are bound to be traps, for their contents are famous and many would recognize them if anyone were foolish enough to take them. I have no desire to have my hands cut off and my arms flayed, either. So I say that we go to this villa and take what we want from it. I doubt if anyone would be able to prove that we had taken the items ourselves, and that is what would condemn us.\" He made a blessing over them. \"The magistrates are reluctant to accuse popes and monks of wrongdoing. If you are working with me, then you are shielded by my cloth.\"\n \"Are all popes as cynical as you?\" Ghornan asked with a hint of admiration.\n \"Not all of them are as poor, and few know how to take advantage of opportunity when it presents itself,\" said Pope Sylvestros severely. \"It is not as if I am helping you steal from Byzantines. These are Romans, and you know what godless pagans they are.\"\n \"And that is all the excuse we need?\" suggested Ghornan.\n \"It is not an excuse,\" Pope Sylvestros insisted. \"I would never assist anyone in taking goods from a true Christian, but these Romans still have temples to their gods, and they think to mislead us all by declaring that they are now churches. None of us are fooled.\"\n \"So you are actually helping the Church by seizing these goods?\" Ghornan laughed. \"Very well, tell me some more about this widow\u0027s villa. Is it all on the list here?\" He looked over the two sheets with more care, his eyes growing large with avarice. \"What\u0027s this?\" He pointed to an item on the second page of notes.\n Pope Sylvestros glanced at the entry in question. \"Oh. Yes, that was very strange. Fourteen chests filled with earth. One of the slaves told me that twenty just like them had been shipped to the widow in Constantinople.\" He scowled. \"I wonder what kind of pagan rites she enacts with that earth?\"\n \"Pagan rites?\" Ghornan asked, heavy brows rising.\n \"What else would she require it for?\" Pope Sylvestros twitched with indignation. \"Rites of fertility, no doubt, or some other abomination.\" He indicated another line on the list. \"This might interest you: twenty-eight platters of silver. They were in a storeroom along with those large brass tubs. Two barrels of sweet oil, and a whole chest filled with spices, which could be worth a great deal. The chest itself is an old one, all antique lacquerwork with brass fittings. It might be as much as four or five centuries old, and there are some who would like it for that reason alone.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-33.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
