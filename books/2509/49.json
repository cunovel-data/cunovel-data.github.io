{"id":107735,"no":49,"title":"Page 49","content":"\"I… I will make a few inquiries,\" said Panaigios, recovering himself enough to appear unaffected. \"And I wish to know who within the household is doing the actual administration. I am curious to discover who it is who is willing to risk the wrath of Belisarius to do this thing. Such a person might be of great use in the future, and will bear close watching in any case, since anyone willing to poison a woman of Antonina\u0027s stature is clearly a dangerous person.\" He tapped the tips of his fingers together. \"Do you think you can do this for me, Panaigios?\" \"Of course, of course,\" he gushed, hoping that his forced enthusiasm did not ring as hollow to Athanatadies\u0027 ears as it did to his own. \"I have already made a few inquiries in regard to the household and it is nothing to make a few more.\" \"You\u0027re more active than you were before,\" Athanatadies said reflectively. \"When did this come upon you?\" \"I have been active in your interests for years,\" Panaigios said, protesting with some emotion. \"You have given me the office to pursue certain of your interests on your behalf and I have done all that I might to fulfill your mandate.\" \"Now, there\u0027s no need to be huffy,\" Athanatadies soothed, his fingertips still meeting lightly. \"You are always alert to any criticism, and often this is against your better judgment. I said nothing to chide you now, merely to observe that your actions would at last appear to be gathering fruit. I assume that you have already made some inquiries into the workings of the household of Belisarius, since that was required of you many months ago. In the past you have complied with my instructions promptly and I can see no reason why this case should be any different, and I know of a great many why you might wish to be especially careful where Belisarius is concerned.\" Panaigios did his best to appear studious. \"You have honored me with many requests, Censor, and I have striven to comply with your requirements as best I can. Certainly there have been times when this was not easily accomplished, but there are other instances when I have done all that I might to see that your instructions were carried out to the fullest.\" \"Who is your man in Belisarius\u0027 household?\" The demand was casual, even offhanded, but Panaigios knew that if he did not answer it honestly and at once his life might easily be forfeit. \"My man there is the eunuch Simones.\" He tried to meet the hard gaze of Athanatadies and did not entirely succeed. \"One or two others, far less significant slaves, I assure you, are also being employed to watch in minor matters.\" \"This Simones, is he trustworthy?\" asked Athanatadies. \"What slave is trustworthy?\" Panaigios countered, buying a little time. \"I am asking about this Simones. Do you trust him?\" There was no suggestion in his tone that he would permit Panaigios to avoid answering him. \"To a degree, yes I do. But that is not saying a great deal.\" He paused, gathering his thoughts and desperately trying to guess what it was that Kimon Athanatadies wanted to know. \"I know that Antonina relies on him and that he has some power in the household. I know that he is regarded with… respect by other slaves in the household. He has been reasonably cooperative with me and has only hesitated when he has been pressed to act in a way against his master\u0027s or mistress\u0027 interests. How much of this is loyalty and how much is simple survival, I do not know and have no way of telling. He has brought me regular reports, and those of the other, lesser slaves have supported what he said. I am not God, and I do not read the hearts of those I employ. I am limited to assessing what they do and how well they do it, and in this case I believe that he is doing his best to accommodate me without compromising himself with Belisarius too badly.\" \"Serving the staff of the Court Censor does not compromise him,\" said Athanatadies with austerity, then added, \"but I suppose he does not yet believe this. It is a complicated thing for a slave to understand. They are simple creatures, which is why God appointed them to their role in life.\" He hesitated, his face so blank that he might have been one of the ikons on the wall. \"You know, Panaigios, a man in your position does well to show a little zeal.\" Caught off-guard by this shift in conversation, Panaigios could not keep from asking, \"A man in my position? Isn\u0027t it preferable that I be dedicated to the work I am given?\" \"Yes, but a man of vision and zeal might find a way to take on the tasks at their widest setting. For example, a man like you with those connections into the house of Belisarius might be in a position, now that there is a tragedy about to occur there, to seize the advantage of such sorrow and unearth the truth of this conspiracy against the Emperor. A man who guards his tongue at other times, when mourning his wife might say things that otherwise he would not. A man who was present, or whose agents were present, might then have information of vast significance that would be welcomed not only by me, but by Justinian himself.\" He regarded Panaigios. \"You have been searching for oracles: heed this one.\" \"I…\" Panaigios did not grasp all that Athanatadies was telling him, but he had sense enough to address the question directly. \"I… am to find evidence, by any means, that will at last implicate Belisarius in a conspiracy, and you suggest that I use the occasion of his wife\u0027s failing health and death as the means to secure it.\" \"That was not precisely what I said, but I would not stop you from interpreting my words in that way.\" He rose. \"We are in grave danger, Panaigios. There are plotters all around us and all desire to see the Emperor cast down. He himself has said to me that he fears enemies in every corner and that he is more certain than ever that only his timely recalling of Belisarius prevented the General from acting against him.\" \"Yes; of course.\" Panaigios made himself be silent for he knew he was dangerously near babbling. \"All that is lacking is actual confirmation of these plots. Once they are in the Emperor\u0027s hands, he will be relieved for there will be necessary action required by the proofs. You do understand the problem, don\u0027t you?\" He was walking away from Panaigios, his dalmatica almost dragging on the floor to hide the misshapen foot no one dared mention. \"Ah… I believe I do,\" Panaigios said cautiously. \"You want some letter or other document that would disclose all the men involved, and their general aims.\" \"That would be useful,\" Athanatadies said. \"As Antonina grows weaker, it is likely that Belisarius will be less careful, and a prudent slave might discover much. Find out for me how much longer we have to wait; remember.\" \"I will; I will.\" He was starting to sweat and his eyes stung. This was a morass, he feared, an abyss that he was sliding into that once in he would never escape. He recalled that all of Kimon Athanatadies\u0027 personal slaves were mutes and for the first time he felt the full impact of this. \"I will send for Simones and get all the information I can out of him. I will send a report to you within two days. I will make certain that if there is any information at all about Antonina\u0027s health and the cause of her illness that I discover everything I can about it.\" \"You know, it is not impossible that a desperate man might attempt many desperate things, such as poisoning his own wife.\" This was said with an air of speculation and hopefulness that filled Panaigios with dread. \"No, Censor,\" he said firmly. \"There are many things that Belisarius might do in his distress, but hurt his wife in any way is not one of them. You and I may think of Antonina as a difficult, demanding and manipulative woman, but Belisarius loves her to adoration, and he would rather run on his sword like a godless Roman than bring any harm to her. He is more anguished by her ailment than he is by his disgrace. There are many people who know this and you might persuade them that Zeus really brings rain more readily than convince them that Belisarius would have any part in hurting Antonina.\" \"It was a thought,\" said Athanatadies with a shrug. \"Pity. It would have saved so much effort.\" He walked a little farther. \"What about that Roman woman? The widow who\u0027s Belisarius\u0027 friend? What of her? Would she have a hand in this?\" \"There is nothing to link Olivia Clemens with Antonina\u0027s poor health. In the last year, Antonina has spent very little time with Olivia, and if there is opportunity for the Roman woman to give her anything poison, I know nothing of it, and I doubt it would be possible to make it appear that this was the case. Olivia occasionally visits Belisarius and often inquires after Antonina, but the two women never developed any closeness and therefore the household would not be likely to support the notion that she would harm Antonina.\" \"Not even to have Belisarius for herself?\" suggested Athanatadies. \"Captain Drosos is her lover. He has said that she has refused to marry him.\" He sighed, for he knew that Athanatadies did not like the answers he was providing. \"She was waiting for a better match,\" Athanatadies guessed. \"A disgraced General without soldiers, stripped of everything but rank and confined to the city?\" Panaigios shook his head. \"If she had been hankering for Belisarius, she had ample opportunity to pursue him in Roma, and all the officers say she did not. She has been enamored of Drosos from the first.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-49.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
