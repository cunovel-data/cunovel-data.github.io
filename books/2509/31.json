{"id":107717,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\"Will you make an effort to recover the estates?\" Niklos already knew the answer but wanted Olivia to answer it for the benefit of whoever was listening. \"I doubt if Totila will honor my request, but once his forces have been routed, then I hope that the Bishop of Roma will accept my petition and see that my lands are restored.\" She paused. \"At least in Roma I may still present such petitions in person. Here I would have to wait until my sponsor chose to act on my behalf.\" \"Mistress, I beg you, do not challenge the order here.\" He made a gesture to encourage her to go on. \"It is not for you to tell me what to do, Niklos, and you would do well to remember this. I have not made it any secret that I am dissatisfied with the restrictions that have been placed upon me since I left Roma, and I will not pretend that I have come to terms with the position in which I find myself. You may be right and it might be prudent for me to make my peace with the requirements of this city, but I cannot. I am a Roman woman, I am a nobleman\u0027s widow and I am not accustomed to the hindrance I find here.\" She saw Niklos motion for more, and so she went on. \"If there are no other means to regain my property, then I suppose I must accommodate the laws here but it galls me.\" \"Mistress, be cautious,\" said Niklos, again gesturing to her for more objections. \"Why? Because it is inconvenient for you, or for some of the Byzantines? What is it to me if there are popes in this city who believe that it is improper for women to have property of their own? You tell me to bide my time, but I wonder to what purpose. I hold your bond, Niklos, and as long as I do, you are beholden to me. I will not tolerate opposition and insolence from you.\" She brought her hand down on the small table beside her low chair. \"Keep that in mind, you arrogant Greek.\" Niklos gave her a thumbs-up as he said, \"Mistress, I think only of your welfare.\" \"You think only of your own welfare, you mean. You are trying to curry favor with the officers of the Court Censor. I will not have it.\" \"You\u0027re wrong, mistress,\" he said, flashing her a smile. \"I would never do such a—\" He broke off and moved silently to the door, waiting. \"Whoever it is has left.\" Olivia\u0027s manner changed as abruptly as Niklos\u0027. \"How bad is it?\" \"We must be very careful, and we must be always on guard. There are spies everywhere.\" He sat down opposite her. \"They are going to make inquiries about you in Roma.\" \"I have no worries there,\" said Olivia. \"There are enough people to testify that I have been living as a widow for some time, and I think that the Bishop of Roma has some of the old records on my land claims, since I have leased sections of it to the Church from time to time.\" She took a deep breath. \"I\u0027m glad I did that, now.\" \"The Court Censor is afraid that you might be part of a conspiracy,\" Niklos went on. \"Magna Mater, who could think such a thing?\" Olivia asked the ceiling. \"What would I gain from it, and who would I conspire against?\" \"They think that everyone associated with Belisarius might be aiding him in overthrowing the Emperor,\" said Niklos with a slow shake of his head. \"That\u0027s ridiculous,\" said Olivia. \"I can\u0027t take such ideas seriously.\" She hesitated. \"Yes, I can.\" \"Then do so,\" warned Niklos. \"And be aware that whatever you say might be reported.\" \"Accurately?\" she asked at once. \"I don\u0027t know,\" admitted Niklos. \"Most of what was recorded of the examination I had this afternoon was put down in more or less true form, but there was a slant to it, just in case. I think they are preparing material in case they need it.\" \"Why?\" said Olivia. \"Because they are trying to discredit Belisarius. He is too popular with the army and the Guard. Justinian is not a fighting man, and there are those who say that if the Empire is to be restored it will be through battles and conquest. For this they will have to have a soldier on the throne. At least that is what the Court Censor appears to think.\" He leaned back. \"These questions were slipped in between those about your genealogy and rumors about the Empress Theodora, and yet the answers I gave to them were more completely recounted than any others.\" \"Ah,\" said Olivia. Her hazel eyes grew tired. \"I wonder why—Who will benefit if Belisarius is discredited?\" \"Those close to the Emperor. In that I think your friend Drosos is correct. There are factions at court that strive for power that they cannot have if Belisarius remains where he is; he must be brought down so that they can gain access to the army through various officers. If the eunuch Narses does indeed replace Belisarius, then there are many who could take advantage of this change and see men of their family advance in the ranks and in military influence.\" Niklos rubbed his jaw. \"I used to think that Roma was bad, but they are amateurs compared to these Byzantines.\" Olivia got up from her chair and began to pace. \"I can\u0027t let them inquire too closely. If they ever found out all there is to know about me, they would have me stoned in the marketplace, and once my spine was broken, I would die the true death at last.\" \"We could leave Konstantinoupolis.\" The suggestion lacked any conviction. \"So soon after arriving? That would attract more attention than we have already.\" She halted, her eyes fastened on the ikonostasis. \"I wish I could find a way to profess my conversion to the religious life, but it isn\u0027t practical.\" Niklos laughed. \"No, a vampire is not often welcome in a religious retreat. And you would be noticed, after a while.\" Reluctantly Olivia joined in the laughter. \"And I doubt I could convince anyone it was my way of taking communion, although in a way, it is.\" \"That would be worse than the rest.\" He met her eyes seriously. \"You must be careful, Olivia. It grows more and more dangerous for you here.\" \"And elsewhere,\" she said. \"I wish we had not left Roma, but I know it was necessary.\" \"Yes,\" said Niklos. \"And while we are here, I will do what I can to be alert. If I knew who in the household was spying on you, I would do what I could to keep watch over that person and be sure that the information he got was carefully controlled.\" \"But you don\u0027t know, and neither do I. And if we are too obvious in trying to find out, it will only serve to make matters worse for us both.\" She touched his arm affectionately. \"We are strangers surrounded by enemies,\" she said softly. \"We must depend on one another more than ever.\" Niklos nodded gravely. \"You can rely on me, Olivia.\" \"And you can rely on me, Niklos.\" She gave a sudden, fleeting grin. \"What mere mortal has a chance against the two of us?\" \"Do you want me to make a list?\" he answered without a trace of humor. Outside there was a sudden shouting in the street and the rush of footsteps. Both Olivia and Niklos listened with hushed alarm. \"No,\" she said when the footfalls were gone. \"Nor I,\" he agreed. In a distant part of the house, they heard a door close softly. Text of a letter from Antonina to Eugenia. In anticipation of the festivities to come, Antonina sends her warmest greetings to Eugenia and wishes to tell her how pleased she is that Eugenia will be able to attend the celebration that will take place in eight days. Naturally, most of the guests will be officers of Belisarius, recently returned from the Italian campaign. It is appropriate that they have such distinction for their action on my husband\u0027s behalf, and doubtless I will be able to learn more of what has transpired since I had my last letter from my husband. Not to be too blatant, Eugenia, this will give you a wonderful opportunity to meet men of rank and ambition who are sensible to the realities of court life and the lives of those close to the court. There are certain to be officers who are of a good age to marry who seek a woman with some skill in court matters and proper conduct for the level of society to which they all aspire. There may be a few, also, with better connections than either of us may easily boast of. Those will be of special interest to you, I am sure, and you will do well to come a trifle early so that we may see who among those who have accepted will be most interesting to you. Since you are to serve as my companion, there is no bar to your addressing any of the guests, or to being the first to speak if that is what you wish to do. Lamentably, Empress Theodora will not be with us. Her health is not what it should be, and her physicians are forbidding her almost all public appearances. I have heard it said by certain malicious and unwise persons that she is paying the price of her early debauchery, and that the illness that is overtaking her is the result of all she did before she became the love of the Emperor. Even if this were true—and it is never wise to think the worst of the Empress, no matter who she is—it is most shortsighted of those speaking against her to do so, for if she recovers, or if Justinian learns of these allegations then the results might be severe. On that note, let me advise you to be very circumspect in what you say about Theodora. Not only are there spies everywhere, but considering the circumstances, you will be well advised to keep your opinions to yourself, no matter what they are, for until it is established how ill Theodora truly is, no statements about her can be thought safe.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-31.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
