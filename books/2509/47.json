Niklos will come with me.\" She did not give Simones a chance to argue, but went quickly to the room she had indicated.\n Belisarius looked exhausted when he joined Olivia there a little later. \"I\u0027ve missed you,\" he said. \"But with Antonina in poor health, and my condition being what it is, we do not often see anyone these days.\"\n \"Antonina is in poor health?\" Olivia repeated, startled at the news. \"When I saw her last, she was thriving.\"\n \"It has only been recently that she has suffered. Her pope tells her that it is the result of the continuing disfavor of Heaven, but I cannot believe it. I have brought so much misfortune on her, and if—\" He stopped abruptly. \"That isn\u0027t why you\u0027re here, is it?\"\n \"No,\" she admitted, her concern not forgotten. \"Niklos was in the market today and saw goods from my Roman villa offered for sale.\" She had not intended to state the problem so directly, but knowing now that Belisarius had many other troubles to plague him, she decided that speaking to the point was best.\n Belisarius looked at Niklos. \"You\u0027re certain?\"\n \"If you had served Olivia as long as I have, you would know these things as if they were your own,\" he said. \"I am certain.\"\n \"He would not have spoken to me unless he was sure,\" Olivia added.\n \"What specifically did you see?\" Belisarius asked.\n \"Two chests, antiques, with brass fittings. They\u0027re most unusual.\" He paused. \"I didn\u0027t look further. However, the stall in the market was filled with Roman goods.\"\n \"And so you assume that if the chests are there, other things may also be. You suspect that there has been some sort of a raid on the villa.\" Belisarius nodded heavily. \"And doubtless you have good reason to think so. My officers have brought me tales that do not bode well.\"\n \"You mean that Totila—\" Olivia began.\n \"Not only our enemies. There are Byzantines who want to pick the carcass before the Ostrogoths get there.\" His bitterness was ferocious and it was a moment before he could speak safely. \"I\u0027m sorry, Olivia. When I left Italy, I was told that my obligations would be honored by Narses and his officers, but… it appears otherwise.\"\n \"You\u0027ve heard of other complaints?\" It was not truly a question. She could read Belisarius\u0027 expression and knew that there had been others.\n \"Unfortunately.\" He lowered his head and rubbed his eyes. \"I am profoundly sorry to learn of this. I\u0027ll start an official inquiry at once, of course.\"\n \"But…\" Olivia regarded him with sympathy.\n \"Yes. You\u0027re right.\" Belisarius stared across the room at a blank spot on the wall. \"But as I am under suspicion of conspiracy and treason, I can make no promises for the success of the inquiry. The Court Censor is convinced that I have acted against the interests of the Emperor, and therefore everything I do and say is scrutinized for possible hidden significance.\" He tugged at the end of his pallium. \"It has even been implied that I have poisoned my own wife to direct suspicion elsewhere.\"\n \"Oh, my friend,\" Olivia said, and went to put her arm over his bowed shoulders.\n He shrugged her away. \"I am contaminated. Don\u0027t be tainted by me.\"\n \"But I already am,\" Olivia said at her most reasonable. \"I came here with your assistance, and I come to you for aid. You were my guest in Roma, and I have been yours here in… Konstantinoupolis. Doubtless if the Censor believes that women are capable of conspiracy—which I doubt—he will have long since decided that I am not to be trusted.\" This time when she put her arm around his shoulder, she did not permit him to break away from her. \"First, I think we must determine exactly how much has been taken from my villa, and what has already been sold.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t you hear me?\" Belisarius demanded.\n \"Yes. And now you will listen to me.\" She sat beside him and kept her arm across his back. \"I wish to discover what I have lost. Niklos has an inventory of the goods from the villa at my house here—which I thank you again for helping me to acquire—and a copy of this can be provided to… to whoever needs it.\"\n \"The magistrate for the Army,\" Belisarius muttered.\n \"Fine. Niklos, a copy of the inventory for the magistrate for the Army. Then it might be wise to inspect the stall and warehouse of the merchant where Niklos found the chest.\" Her strength surprised Belisarius when he tried once more to move away from her. \"Don\u0027t you agree?\"\n Capitulating, Belisarius turned to her. \"All right, Olivia. I\u0027ll try to arrange for the inspection. Is there anything else you want?\"\n Her laughter was sadder than any he had ever heard. \"Magna Mater, yes. The list is so long—\" She forced a half-smile back onto her lips. \"But for the time being, tell me what is wrong with Antonina. Perhaps I can help.\"\n Belisarius took her free hand in both of his. As he stared down at their interlaced fingers, he admitted, \"Christos, I hope so. I\u0027m frightened, Olivia: I\u0027m afraid.\"\n Text of a letter from the physician Mnenodatos to his unknown correspondent.\n On the Feast of the Armenian Martyrs, the physician Mnenodatos sends his greetings to his continuing friend.\n Your request for information regarding certain poisons, while no doubt necessary, nevertheless concerns me. Your generosity is most welcome, and I am grateful for all you have done for me, but I must inquire more closely into the use to which you have put this information, for if there has been any misuse of your knowledge gained through me, I am as culpable as you are, in fact, because I have given you the degree of information I have, I am more culpable in the eyes of the law.\n While I have no wish to lose your assistance and friendship, I find myself in a very awkward state, since I am now in a position where I am apt to be blamed for the misfortune of another. Not only do I not know who you are, I am in no position to know who it is you have acquired this information for and to what end it is being used, and I beseech you to tell me at least some portion of what I have requested so that I will not be entirely without protection.\n Your latest request comes with a most beneficent payment, one far exceeding the worth of what I have told you, and for that reason if no other, I dread what you might do. I have a wife and children to think of, good friend, and they might easily be made beggars tomorrow if you are not acting as honorably as I pray you are.\n At first, it did not trouble me that you did not say who you are or in what capacity you employ the information you have obtained from me. But that was before the riots last week, and now I am afraid that those who believe that the Empress Theodora met her end by poison might search out all of us who have some knowledge of the subject and inquire into their activity. At this time, I could not prevail if such an inquiry were made of me, and that fills me with the gravest foreboding.\n Come forth, I pray you, and reveal who you are and what you are doing. I give my word on the Most Holy Spear that I will not betray you, and I will accept your vow that you will not betray me. Until some such assurance is given me, I cannot provide you any more information or assistance, and I am convinced that if you examine your conscience, you will grant my requests as the reasonable protection they are.\n If you decide that you cannot do this, or that you will not contact me again, know that I have your various notes and letters which I will surrender to any officer of the court who makes any inquiry whatever of me. I might not be able to identify you for them, but I will reveal to what extent you have involved me in whatever scheme you are acting upon. Naturally I would rather not have to do this, and if you act promptly and in good faith, I will demonstrate my sincerity by surrendering all copies of your notes and letters to you for your disposal in any way you see fit.\n Mnenodatos\n Physician\n 6\n Thekla was over fifty and revered for her years as well as her long religious vocation. Since age eight, she had lived a virtual hermit in a cell scraped out of the city battlements facing the Sea of Marmara. It was said that the Emperor Theodosius II who had ordered the extension of Constantine\u0027s seaward battlements had intended to protect the city from the land as well as the sea, and Thekla was one of many who had brought her holiness to fortify the walls.\n \"But most holy woman,\" said Panaigios, leaning nearer the wall so that he would be able to hear the few, whispered words she would vouchsafe him, \"surely you know more of the dangers facing the Emperor from those who stand nearest to him.\"\n \"That is always the most dangerous,\" whispered the dry, ancient voice. \"Judas stood nearest Christos, they say. He kissed Him.\"\n \"But who stands nearest Justinian that might do such a thing?\" Panaigios demanded. His position with Kimon Athanatadies had slipped in the last year and he was growing desperate for the means to renew his situation.\n Thekla laughed, or so it seemed to Panaigios who heard the rustling sound with an emotion near awe. \"You do not want to know. The righteous are vilified and the vile are exalted.\"\n \"Do you mean that the Emperor Justinian is not entitled to rule?\" Panaigios gasped. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-47.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
