The Emperor is a stern man, an unforgiving man of strong principles and great determination. He seeks to purify his reign.\" He straightened up, looking toward the door. \"We are either his allies or his enemies, and he will regard us accordingly.\"\\n\\n \"I am not his enemy.\" Panaigios put down his cup, the wine untasted.\\n\\n \"I did not say you are. But you must persevere and be more stringent than ever.\"\\n\\n Panaigios swallowed hard. \"You said there are those who are not to be spoken of. What have they done that they are—\"\\n\\n \"They have displeased Justinian,\" said the Censor. \"They have been shown to be working against the Empire.\" He recalled the confessions he had read, and the petitions that had been made to the Emperor for the destruction of the families of the men.\\n\\n \"A great crime,\" said Panaigios, his tone a bit distracted. \"I… I know we are not to speak of them, but who are they?\" He faltered. \"Great Censor, what am I to do to defend the Empire if I do not know who these pernicious men are?\"\\n\\n Athanatadies cleared his throat. \"I will tell you once, Panaigios, and then you are not to speak of it again. I warn you, if you mention these men, you place yourself in great danger and there is little I can do to protect you should you have so great a transgression. The men are all Captains: Savas, Leonidas, Fortunos Ipakradies, and Hipparchos. They, and their families, are… expunged.\"\\n\\n \"They were Belisarius\u0027 officers, weren\u0027t they?\" Panaigios asked, wishing he could call the words back as soon as he had spoken them.\\n\\n \"Yes; Fortunos served with him in Africa, the others in the Italian campaign.\" He indicated the food. \"You\u0027re not eating.\"\\n\\n Obediently Panaigios took one of the dried figs stuffed with crushed almonds, but it had no taste and no savor.\\n\\n \"And Belisarius? What of him?\"\\n\\n \"The Emperor demands proof before he condemns, for he is a just man.\" He fell silent, then resumed. \"He has found no proof that makes the General part of a conspiracy.\"\\n\\n \"But his officers—\"\\n\\n \"They claim there is no conspiracy, but they are opposed to what the Emperor has done with the army and they do not endorse his plan to reestablish the Empire as it was in the days of Imperial Roma. That is reason enough to accuse them, and their actions have shown that they are the enemies of the Emperor, so he has declared that they are not only dead men, but men who never existed.\" He joined his hands, staring at his linked fingers to see if they still trembled. \"The Emperor has ordered me that where treason is discovered, it is to be eradicated, the traitor and all his blood, so that the poisonous growth of conspiracy may be ended.\"\\n\\n Panaigios paled. \"The families? What… how… Are they to be enslaved?\"\\n\\n \"That is for the Emperor to determine,\" said the Censor in a flat voice. He saw the dark, severe eyes boring into his once more, and heard that hard-edged voice issuing orders that made his skin prickle. \"I am the devoted servant of Justinian, and I will do all that he requires of me with a grateful heart and a dedicated mind.\"\\n\\n \"Amen, and God aid us in the endeavor,\" said Panaigios. He chose another dried fruit but could not bring himself to eat it. The fig felt as if it was lodged halfway down his gullet and if he ate anything more, it might choke him.\\n\\n \"I will beseech God to do so every day,\" Athanatadies stated. \"And I will depend upon you to be more diligent than ever. You hear many things and you have those who report to you; whatever you are told that might have any bearing on this, I must hear of it at once, so that I may inform the Emperor.\" There were others who would tell Justinian if Athanatadies was lax in performing his duties.\\n\\n What would befall him then he did not want to think about.\\n\\n \"Four Captains. That is very dangerous.\" Panaigios watched the Censor closely, searching for a clue to what Athanatadies expected of him, what he wanted from him. \"I will be certain that those whose aid I have required take extra care.\"\\n\\n \"I depend on you to do that,\" said Athanatadies, feeling very tired. \"You are to urge those you employ to be on the alert for anything that might point to treason. Tell them that no one is exempt from his duty to the Emperor and God.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, certainly,\" said Panaigios, determined to send for Simones before the night was over.\\n\\n \"Be careful of your sources, for a false accusation can be as dangerous as a true one left unspoken. The Emperor has warned me that he will not tolerate those seeking vengeance through lies. He will deal with such trickery as he would with treason.\" He wondered if Panaigios could hear the fright in his voice; he could smell himself again, that civetlike odor that came from fear.\\n\\n \"I will take care. I will examine all my assistants with care and I will do all that I can to determine the truth of what they say before I inform you of it.\"\\n\\n \"That is good,\" said Athanatadies. \"But do not be overcautious, or delay too long, or you and I might both be taken to task for our lack of dedication.\" His hands were moist; he let them drop to his sides.\\n\\n Panaigios took a long sip of the wine; it was no good, the fig would not budge. \"I… I will have to make a few arrangements, Athanatadies.\"\\n\\n \"Make them.\" Now that he had alerted his secretary, he wanted nothing more than to be left to pray before his next interview. He longed for the solace of his chapel, where he could prostrate himself before the altar and its jeweled and gilded ikons, to lose himself in the ritual of worship.\\n\\n \"At once,\" said Panaigios, thinking that he would have to find time to visit Thekla once again, to learn what he could from the old holy woman.\\n\\n \"You must discharge your commission with circumspection,\" said Athanatadies. \"The Emperor requires this of you, and if you are his true subject, you will be unstinting in your efforts on his behalf.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Panaigios had more of the wine.\\n\\n \"I will expect to speak with you the day after tomorrow. Have something of value for me then, Panaigios, and you will be well-rewarded for it.\"\\n\\n \"I will do my utmost,\" Panaigios assured him. He rose from his chair and made a reverence. \"I will renew my purpose with every prayer.\" As he left, he told himself that he would have to be more demanding of Simones. There had to be more information he could glean from the slave, and he feared that if he did not provide the Censor with what he demanded, he would fall into obscurity, and perhaps join the company of those who were no longer spoken of, who had ceased to exist.\\n\\n Text of a letter from Olivia to Chrysanthos, written in Latin.\\n\\n To Captain Chrysanthos, Olivia of Roma sends her greetings and makes a request of him: I know that you are in communication with your comrade Drosos, and that you have access to routes not generally open to the rest of the world. I ask that you send him my affections and my concerns, for what he has said to me troubles me, and I am worried that he is suffering.\\n\\n Please say to Drosos that my love for him is undimin-ished, and that while he is filled with conflict, I long only to help him end his turmoil. I do not want him to turn away from me because he is angry with himself. I feel no anger toward him, and I do not despise him, no matter what he has done. It is Drosos I love, not the acts he is compelled to do. It is Drosos I miss, not the officer of the Emperor. It is Drosos, always Drosos, who compels me, not the orders he follows. I am afraid he does not trust me enough, that he doubts I would be steadfast in the face of all that has happened. Let him know that he has no reason to question my faithfulness. He is what I love, and my love does not fail when circumstances are against us.\\n\\n I know you will be prudent in what you say to him, but I ask you to give him my love and my assurances. I want him to be certain that he is welcome when he returns and that he need not fear I will desert him.\\n\\n It may be that my own situation will become more difficult than it is now, and if that is the case, I ask you to tell Drosos to have patience. I will find a way to be with him once he is in this city again. Sadly, I cannot go to him, much as I would like to, for my petition for permission to establish a household in Alexandria has been denied by the Court Censor. For the time being it appears that I am confined to Konstantinoupolis. However, this house is always open to Drosos, at whatever time, in whatever circumstances, for whatever purpose he wishes.\\n\\n While it would not be wise to let this be known to any but Drosos, I trust to your discretion and prudence in how you inform him of what I have said. I am not permitted to write to him directly; I hope your friendship for your comrade-at-arms will extend to me in this case, and that you will find a way to pass these words to him.\\n\\n If you do not believe it is safe to write to him, or if in writing to him, you decide it is wisest not to mention me, let me know of it so that I may find another way to reach him. I dare not say much about my concern, but it is genuine and profound. There are few men who have moved me as Drosos has, and I cannot see him in travail without wanting to ease his burdens.\\n\\n Whatever your decision, I am grateful that you have read these words from \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-flame-in-byzantium-atta-olivia-clemens-1/page-63.html","bookId":2509,"book":{"id":2509,"title":"A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1)","description":"Storyline: A Flame in Byzantium (Atta Olivia Clemens #1) \\n Atta Olivia Clemens had received St. Germain\u0027s darkest gift.
