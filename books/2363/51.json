For the last two days, she had felt her life energy flowing out of her. I am going to die here on this planet. She drifted into what she thought would be her last sleep. And then, the rain came.

She stood up then, and raised her hands high, letting the water pour over her, giving her new strength, bringing her back to life. She let the rain water fill her body, absorbing it into her very essence, until she began to feel her tiredness vanish. She felt herself growing stronger and stronger, until finally, she thought, I am ready. I can think clearly. I know who can help me find my way back.
