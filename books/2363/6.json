{"id":68648,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Dustin (Dusty) Thornton, Acting Director of the Office of Naval Intelligence, had won his fame as one of the greatest athletes ever to come out of Annapolis. Thornton owed his present exalted position to a football game. An Army-Navy game, to be precise. Thornton, a towering monolith of a man, had played fullback as a senior at Annapolis, in the Navy\u0027s most important game of the year. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, with Army leading 13-0, two touchdowns and a conversion ahead, destiny stepped in and changed Dustin Thornton\u0027s life. Thornton intercepted an Army pass, pivoted around and charged through the Army phalanx for a touchdown. Navy missed on the extra point but soon scored a field goal. After the ensuing kick-off Army failed to make a first down and punted into Navy territory. The score stood at Army 13, Navy 9, and the clock was running. When play resumed, the ball was passed to Thornton, and he went down under a heap of Army uniforms. It took him a long time to get to his feet. A doctor came running out onto the field. Thornton angrily waved him away. With seconds left to play, signals were called for a lateral pass. Thornton caught it on his own ten-yard line, and took off. He was unstoppable. He charged through the opposition like a tank, knocking down everyone unlucky enough to get in his way. With two seconds to go, Thornton crossed the goal line for the winning touchdown and Navy scored its first victory against Army in four years. That, in itself, would have had little effect on Thornton\u0027s life. What made the event significant was that seated in a box reserved for VIPs were Willard Stone and his daughter, Eleanor. As the crowd rose to their feet, wildly cheering the Navy hero, Eleanor turned to her father and said quietly, \"I want to meet him.\" Eleanor Stone was a woman of large appetites. Plain-faced, she had a voluptuous body and an insatiable libido. Watching Dustin Thornton savagely plough his way down the football field, she fantasized what he would be like in bed. If his manhood was as big as the rest of his body ... She was not disappointed. Six months later, Eleanor and Dustin Thornton were married. That was the beginning. Dustin Thornton went to work for his father-in-law and was inducted into an arcane world he had not dreamed existed. Willard Stone, Thornton\u0027s new father-in-law, was a man of mystery. A billionaire with powerful political connections, and a past shrouded in secrecy, he was a shadowy figure who pulled strings in a dozen capitals of the world. He was in his late sixties, a meticulous man whose every movement was precise and methodical. He had razor-sharp features, with hooded eyes that revealed nothing. Willard Stone believed in wasting neither words nor emotions, and he was ruthless in obtaining what he wanted. The rumours about him were fascinating. He was reported to have murdered a competitor in Malaysia, and to have had a torrid affair with the favourite wife of an emir. He was said to have backed a successful revolution in Nigeria. The government had brought half a dozen indictments against him, but they were always mysteriously dropped. There were tales of bribes, and senators suborned, business secrets stolen, and witnesses who disappeared. Stone was an advisor to presidents and kings. He was raw, naked power. Among Stone\u0027s many properties was a large, isolated estate in the Colorado mountains, where every year scientists, captains of industry and world leaders gathered for seminars. Armed guards kept out unwanted visitors. Willard Stone had not only approved his daughter\u0027s marriage, he had encouraged it. His new son-in-law was brilliant, ambitious, and most important, malleable. Twelve years after the marriage, Stone arranged for Dustin to be appointed Ambassador to South Korea. Several years later, the President appointed him Ambassador to the United Nations. When Admiral Ralph Whittaker was suddenly ousted as Acting Director of ONI, Thornton took his place. That day, Willard Stone sent for his son-in-law. \"This is merely the beginning,\" Stone promised. \"I have bigger plans for you, Dustin. Great plans.\" And he had proceeded to outline them. Two years earlier, Robert had had his first meeting with the new Acting Director of ONI. \"Sit down, Commander.\" There was no cordiality in Dustin Thornton\u0027s voice. \"I see by your record that you\u0027re something of a maverick.\" What the hell does he mean? Robert wondered. He decided to keep his mouth shut. Thornton looked up. \"I don\u0027t know how Admiral Whittaker ran this office when he was in charge, but from now on we\u0027re doing everything by the book. I expect my orders to be carried out to the letter. Do I make myself clear?\" Jesus, Robert thought, what the hell are we in for here? \"Do I make myself clear, Commander?\" \"Yes. You expect your orders to be carried out to the letter.\" He wondered whether he was expected to salute. \"That\u0027s all.\" But it was not all. A month later, Robert was sent to East Germany to bring in a scientist who wanted to defect. It was a dangerous assignment because the Stasi, East Germany\u0027s Central Security Secret Police, had learned about the proposed defection and was watching the scientist closely. In spite of that, Robert had managed to smuggle the man across the border, to a safe house. He was making arrangements to bring him to Washington, when he received a call from Dustin Thornton, telling him that the situation had changed, and that he was to drop the assignment. \"We can\u0027t just dump him here,\" Robert had protested. \"They\u0027ll kill him.\" \"That\u0027s his problem,\" Thornton had replied. \"Your orders are to come back home.\" Screw you, Robert thought. I\u0027m not going to abandon him. He had called a friend of his in MI6, British Intelligence, and explained the situation. \"If he goes back to East Germany,\" Robert said, \"they\u0027ll chop him. Will you take him?\" \"I\u0027ll see what can be done, old chap. Bring him along.\" And the scientist had been given haven in England. Dustin Thornton never forgave Robert for disobeying his instructions. From that point on, there was open animosity between the two men. Thornton had discussed the incident with his father-in-law. \"Loose cannons like Bellamy are dangerous,\" Willard Stone warned. \"They\u0027re a security hazard. Men like that are expendable. Remember that.\" And Thornton had remembered. Now, walking down the corridor toward Dustin Thornton\u0027s office, Robert could not help thinking about the difference between Thornton and Whittaker. In a job like this, trust was the sine qua non. He did not trust Dustin Thornton. Thornton was seated behind his desk when Robert walked into his office. \"You wanted to see me?\" \"Yes. Sit down, Commander.\" Their relationship had never reached the \"Robert\" phase. \"I\u0027ve been told you\u0027ve been temporarily transferred to the National Security Agency. When you come back, I have a ...\" \"I\u0027m not coming back. This is my last assignment.\" \"What?\" \"I\u0027m quitting.\" Thinking about it later, Robert was not sure exactly what reaction he had expected. Some kind of scene. Dustin Thornton could have shown surprise, or he could have argued, or been angry, or relieved. Instead, he had merely looked at Robert and nodded. \"That\u0027s it then, isn\u0027t it?\" When Robert returned to his own office, he said to his secretary, \"Barbara, I\u0027m going to be away for a while. I\u0027ll be leaving in about an hour.\" \"Is there some place where you can be reached?\" Robert remembered General Milliard\u0027s orders. \"No.\" \"There are some meetings you ...\" \"Cancel them.\" He looked at his watch. It was time to meet Admiral Whittaker. They had breakfast in the centre yard of the Pentagon at the Ground Zero Cafe, so named because it was once thought that the Pentagon was where the first nuclear bomb attack against the United States would take place. Robert had arranged for a corner table where they would have a degree of privacy. Admiral Whit-taker was punctual, and as Robert watched him approach the table, it seemed to him that the Admiral looked older and smaller, as though semi-retirement had somehow aged and shrunk him. He was still a striking-looking man with strong features, a Roman nose, good cheekbones, and a crown of silvered hair. Robert had served under the Admiral in Vietnam and later in the Office of Naval Intelligence, and he had a high regard for him. More than a high regard, Robert admitted to himself. Admiral Whittaker was his surrogate father. The Admiral sat down. \"Good morning, Robert. Well, did they transfer you to NSA?\" Robert nodded. \"Temporarily.\" The waitress arrived and the two men studied the menu. \"I had forgotten how bad the food here was.\" Admiral Whittaker smiled. He looked around the room, his face filled with an unspoken nostalgia. He wishes he were back here, Robert thought. Amen. They ordered. When the waitress was out of earshot, Robert said, \"Admiral, General Hilliard is sending me on an urgent three-thousand-mile trip to locate some witnesses who saw a weather balloon crash. I find that strange. And there\u0027s something else that\u0027s even stranger. \u0027Time is of the essence,\u0027 to quote the General, but I\u0027ve been ordered not to use any of my intelligence contacts abroad to help me.\" Admiral Whittaker looked puzzled. \"I suppose the General must have his reasons.\" Robert said, \"I can\u0027t imagine what they are.\" Admiral Whittaker studied Robert. Commander Bellamy had served under him in Vietnam and had been the best pilot in the squadron. The Admiral\u0027s son, Edward, had been Robert\u0027s bombardier, and on the terrible day their plane had been shot down, Edward had been killed. Robert had barely survived. The Admiral had gone to the hospital to visit him. \"He\u0027s not going to make it,\" the doctors had told him. Robert, lying there in agonizing pain, had whispered, \"I\u0027m sorry about Edward ... I\u0027m so sorry.\" Admiral Whittaker had squeezed Robert\u0027s hand. \"I know you did everything you could. You\u0027ve got to get well, now. You\u0027re going to be fine.\" He wanted desperately for Robert to live. In the Admiral\u0027s mind, Robert was his son now, the son who would take Edward\u0027s place. And Robert had pulled through. \"Robert ...\" \"Yes, Admiral?\" \"I hope your mission to Switzerland is successful.\" \"So do I. It\u0027s my last one.\" \"You\u0027re still determined to quit?\" The Admiral was the only one Robert had confided in. \"I\u0027ve had enough.\" \"Thornton?\" \"It\u0027s not just him. It\u0027s me. I\u0027m tired of interfering with other people\u0027s lives.\" I\u0027m tired of the lies and the cheating, and the broken promises that were never meant to be kept. I\u0027m tired of manipulating people, and of being manipulated. I\u0027m tired of the games and the danger and the betrayals. It\u0027s cost me everything I ever gave a damn about. \"Do you have any idea what you\u0027re going to do?\" \"I\u0027ll try to find something useful to do with my life, something positive.\" \"What if they won\u0027t let you go?\" Robert said, \"They have no choice, have they?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-doomsday-conspiracy/page-6.html","bookId":2363,"book":{"id":2363,"title":"The Doomsday Conspiracy","description":"Storyline: OPERATION DOOMSDAY ...
