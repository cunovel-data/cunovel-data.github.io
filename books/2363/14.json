The older child was awakened by a shimmering yellow light shining through his bedroom window. When he got up to investigate, the light had disappeared.\\n\\n In the yard, Tozzi, their German shepherd, began barking furiously, awakening old man Lagenfeld. Reluctantly, the farmer got out of bed to quiet the animal, and when he stepped outside he heard the sound of frightened sheep crashing against their pen, trying to escape. As Lagenfeld passed the trough, which had been filled to the brim by the recent rainfall, he noticed that it was bone dry.\\n\\n Tozzi came running to his side, whimpering. Lagenfeld absently patted the animal on the head. \"It\u0027s all right, boy. It\u0027s all right.\"\\n\\n And at that moment, every light in the house went out. When the farmer returned to the house and picked up the telephone to call the power company, the phone was dead.\\n\\n If the lights had remained on a moment longer, the farmer might have seen a strangely beautiful woman walk out of his barnyard and into the field beyond. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-doomsday-conspiracy/page-14.html","bookId":2363,"book":{"id":2363,"title":"The Doomsday Conspiracy","description":"Storyline: OPERATION DOOMSDAY \\n ...
