He had had a late night entertaining a group of visiting senators from the United States. \"What\u0027s the problem, Billy?\"\n \"I just received a call from the radar tower, sir. Either all our equipment has gone crazy or we\u0027re having some strange visitors.\"\n General Shipley pushed himself out of bed. \"I\u0027ll be there in five minutes.\"\n The darkened radar room was filled with enlisted men and officers gathered around the lighted radar screens in the centre of the room. They turned and sprang to attention as the General entered.\n \"At ease.\" He walked over to the officer in charge, Captain Muller. \"What\u0027s going on here, Lewis?\"\n Captain Muller scratched his head. \"It beats me. Do you know any plane that can travel 22,000 miles per hour, stop on a dirne, and go into reverse?\"\n General Shipley was staring at him. \"What are you talking about?\"\n \"According to our radar screens, that\u0027s what\u0027s been going on for the last half hour. At first, we thought it might be some kind of electronic device that\u0027s being tested, but we checked with the Russians, the British and the French, and they\u0027re picking up the same thing on their radar screens.\"\n \"So, it couldn\u0027t be something in the equipment,\" General Shipley said heavily.\n \"No, sir. Not unless you want to assume that all the radar in the world has suddenly gone crazy.\"\n \"How many of these have appeared on the screen?\"\n \"Over a dozen. They move so fast that it\u0027s hard to even keep track of them. We pick them up and they disappear again. We\u0027ve eliminated atmospheric conditions, meteors, fireballs, weather balloons, and any kind of flying machine known to man. I was going to scramble some planes, but these objects - whatever they are -are flying so damned high that we\u0027d never be able to get near them.\"\n General Shipley walked over to one of the radar screens. \"Is anything coming in on your screens now?\"\n \"No, sir. They\u0027re gone.\" He hesitated a moment. \"But, General, I have a terrible feeling they\u0027ll be coming back.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-doomsday-conspiracy/page-30.html","bookId":2363,"book":{"id":2363,"title":"The Doomsday Conspiracy","description":"Storyline: \n OPERATION DOOMSDAY \n ...
