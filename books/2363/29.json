{"id":68671,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"Day Nine\\n\\n Fort Smith, Canada\\n\\n Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories, is a prosperous town of two thousand people, most of them farmers and cattle ranchers, with a sprinkling of merchants. The climate itself is demanding, with long and rigorous winters, and the town is living proof of Darwin\u0027s theory of the survival of the fittest.\\n\\n William Mann was one of the fit ones, a survivor. He had been born in Michigan, but in his early thirties he had passed through Fort Smith on a fishing trip and had decided that the community needed another good bank. He had seized the opportunity. There was only one other bank there, and it took William Mann less than two years to put his competitor out of business. Mann ran his bank the way a bank should be run. His god was mathematics, and he saw to it that the numbers always came out to his benefit. His favourite story was the joke about the man who went to a banker pleading for a loan so that his young son could have an immediate operation to save his life. When the applicant said he had no security, the banker told him to get out of his office.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go,\" the man said, \"but I want to tell you that in all my years, I\u0027ve never met anyone as coldhearted as you are.\"\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" the banker replied. \"I\u0027ll make you a sporting proposition. One of my eyes is a glass eye. If you can tell me which one it is, I\u0027ll give you the loan.\"\\n\\n Instantly, the man said, \"Your left one.\"\\n\\n The banker was amazed. \"No one knows that. How could you tell?\"\\n\\n The man said, \"That\u0027s easy. For a moment, I thought I detected a gleam of sympathy in your left eye, so I knew it must be your glass eye.\"\\n\\n That, to William Mann, was a good businessman\u0027s story. One did not conduct business based on sympathy. You had to look at the bottom line. While other banks in Canada and the United States were toppling like tenpins, William Mann\u0027s bank was stronger than ever. His philosophy was simple: no loans to start up businesses; no investments in junk bonds; no loans to neighbours whose children might desperately need an operation.\\n\\n Mann had a respect that bordered on awe for the Swiss banking system. The gnomes of Zurich were bankers\u0027 bankers. So, one day, William Mann decided to go to Switzerland to speak to some of the bankers there to learn if there was anything he was missing, any way he could squeeze more cents out of the Canadian dollar. He had been received graciously, but in the end he had learned nothing new. His own banking methods were admirable, and the Swiss bankers had not hesitated to tell him so.\\n\\n On the day he was to leave for home, Mann decided to treat himself to a tour of the Alps. He had found the tour boring. The scenery was interesting, but no prettier than the scenery around I; Fort Smith. One of the passengers, a Texan, had dared try to persuade him to make a loan on a ranch that was going into bankruptcy. He had laughed in the man\u0027s face. The only thing about the tour that was of any interest was the crash of the so-called flying saucer. Mann had not believed in the reality of that for an instant. He was sure it had been staged by the Swiss government to impress tourists. He had been to Disney World and he had seen similar things that looked real, but were faked. It\u0027s Switzerland\u0027s glass eye, he thought sardonically.\\n\\n William Mann was happy to return home.\\n\\n Every minute of the banker\u0027s day was meticulously scheduled, and when his secretary came in and said that a stranger wished to see him, Mann\u0027s first instinct was to dismiss him. \"What is it he wants?\"\\n\\n \"He says he wants to do an interview with you. He\u0027s writing an article about bankers.\"\\n\\n That was a different matter entirely. Publicity of the right kind was good for business. William Mann straightened his jacket, smoothed down his hair, and said, \"Send him in.\"\\n\\n His visitor was an American. He was well dressed, which indicated that he worked for one of the better magazines or newspapers.\\n\\n \"Mr Mann?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Robert Bellamy.\"\\n\\n \"My secretary tells me you want to do an article about me.\"\\n\\n \"Well, not entirely about you,\" Robert said. \"But you\u0027ll certainly be prominent in it. My newspaper ...\"\\n\\n \"Which newspaper is that?\"\\n\\n \"The Wall Street Journal.\"\\n\\n Ah, yes. This was going to be excellent.\\n\\n \"The Journal feels that most bankers are too isolated from what\u0027s going on in the rest of the world. They seldom travel, they don\u0027t go to other countries. You, on the other hand, Mr Mann, have the reputation of being very well travelled.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose I am,\" Mann said modestly. \"As a matter of fact, I came back from a trip to Switzerland just last week.\"\\n\\n \"Really? Did you enjoy it?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I met with several other bankers there. We discussed world economics.\"\\n\\n Robert had pulled out a notebook and was making notes. \"Did you have any time for pleasure?\"\\n\\n \"Not really. Oh, I took a little tour on one of those buses. I had never seen the Alps before.\"\\n\\n Robert made another note. \"A tour. Now that\u0027s exactly the kind of thing we\u0027re looking for,\" Robert said, encouragingly. \"I imagine you met a lot of interesting people on the bus.\"\\n\\n \"Interesting?\" He thought about the Texan who had tried to borrow money. \"Not really.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n Mann looked at him. The reporter obviously expected him to say more. You\u0027ll certainly be prominent in the article. \"There was this Russian girl.\"\\n\\n Robert made a note. \"Really? Tell me about her.\"\\n\\n \"Well, we got to talking, and I explained to her how backward Russia was and what terrible trouble they were heading for unless they changed.\"\\n\\n \"She must have been very impressed,\" Robert said.\\n\\n \"Oh, she was. Seemed like a bright girl. For a Russian, that is. They\u0027re all pretty insulated, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Did she mention her name?\"\\n\\n \"No. Wait. It was Olga something.\"\\n\\n \"Did she happen to say where she was from?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. She works as a librarian at the main branch in Kiev. It was her first trip abroad, I guess because of glasnost. If you want my opinion ...\" he stopped to make sure Robert was writing it down, \"Gorbachev sent Russia to hell in a hand basket. East Germany was handed to Bonn on a plate. On the political front Gorbachev moved too fast, and on the economic front he moved too slowly.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s fascinating,\" Robert murmured. He spent another half hour with the banker, listening to his opinionated comments on everything from the Common Market to arms control. He was able to get no further information about other passengers.\\n\\n When Robert returned to his hotel, he telephoned General Hilliard\u0027s office.\\n\\n \"Just a moment, Commander Bellamy.\"\\n\\n He heard a series of clicks, and then General Hilliard was on the line.\\n\\n \"Yes, Commander?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve traced another passenger, General.\"\\n\\n \"The name?\"\\n\\n \"William Mann. He owns a bank in Fort Smith, Canada.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you. I\u0027ll have the Canadian authorities speak to him right away.\"\\n\\n \"By the way, he gave me another lead. I\u0027ll be flying to Russia this evening. I\u0027ll need a visa from Intourist.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you calling from?\"\\n\\n \"Fort Smith.\"\\n\\n \"Stop at the Visigoth Hotel in Stockholm. There will be an envelope for you at the desk.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n FLASH MESSAGE\\n\\n TOP SECRET ULTRA\\n\\n NSA TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR CGHQ\\n\\n EYES ONLY\\n\\n COPY ONE OF (ONE) COPIES\\n\\n SUBJECT: OPERATION DOOMSDAY\\n\\n 7. WILLIAM MANN - FORT SMITH\\n\\n END OF MESSAGE\\n\\n At eleven o\u0027clock that evening William Mann\u0027s doorbell rang. He was not expecting anyone, and he disliked unannounced callers. His housekeeper had retired, and his wife was in her room upstairs, asleep. Annoyed, Mann opened the front door. Two men dressed in black suits stood in the doorway.\\n\\n \"William Mann?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n One of the men pulled out an identification card. \"We\u0027re from the Bank of Canada. May we come in?\"\\n\\n Mann frowned. \"What\u0027s this about?\"\\n\\n \"We would prefer to discuss that inside if you don\u0027t mind.\"\\n\\n \"Very well.\" He led the men into the living room.\\n\\n \"You were recently in Switzerland, were you not?\"\\n\\n The question threw him off guard. \"What? Yes, but what on earth ...?\"\\n\\n \"While you were gone we had your books audited, Mr Mann. Are you aware that there is a shortage in your bank of one million dollars?\"\\n\\n William Mann looked at the two men, aghast. \"What are you talking about? I check those books every week myself. There has never been one penny missing!\"\\n\\n \"One million dollars, Mr Mann. We think you\u0027re responsible for embezzling it.\"\\n\\n His face was turning red. He found himself sputtering. \"How ... how dare you! Get out of here before I call the police.\"\\n\\n \"That won\u0027t do you any good. What we want you to do is repent.\"\\n\\n He was staring at them now, confused. \"Repent? Repent what! You\u0027re crazy!\"\\n\\n \"No, sir.\"\\n\\n One of the men pulled out a gun. \"Sit down, Mr Mann.\"\\n\\n Oh, my God! I\u0027m being robbed. \"Look,\" Mann said, \"take whatever you want. There\u0027s no need for violence and ...\"\\n\\n \"Sit down, please.\"\\n\\n The second man walked over to the liquor cabinet. It was locked. He smashed the glass and pulled the cabinet open. He picked up a large water glass, filled it with scotch, and carried it over to where Mann was seated.\\n\\n \"Drink this. It will relax you.\"\\n\\n \"I ... I never drink after dinner. My doctor ...\"\\n\\n The other man put the gun to William Mann\u0027s temple. \"Drink it or the glass is going to be full of your brains.\"\\n\\n Mann understood now that he was in the hands of two maniacs. He took the glass in his shaking hand and took a sip.\\n\\n \"Drink it down.\"\\n\\n He took a larger swallow. \"What ... what is it you want?\" He raised his voice, hoping that his wife might hear and come downstairs, but it was a vain hope. He knew what a sound sleeper she was. The men were obviously here to rob the house. Why don\u0027t they just get on with it?\\n\\n \"Take anything,\" he said. \"I won\u0027t stop you.\"\\n\\n \"Finish up what\u0027s in the glass.\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t necessary. I ...\"\\n\\n The man punched him hard above his ear. Mann gasped with pain. \"Finish it.\"\\n\\n He swallowed the rest of the whisky in one gulp, and felt it burning as it went down. He was beginning to feel giddy. \"My safe is upstairs in the bedroom,\" he said. His words were beginning to slur. \"I\u0027ll open it for you.\" Maybe that would wake his wife and she could call the police.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no hurry,\" the man with the gun said. \"You have plenty of time for another drink.\"\\n\\n The second man went back to the liquor cabinet and filled the glass to the brim again. \"Here.\"\\n\\n \"No, really,\" William Mann protested. \"I don\u0027t want it.\"\\n\\n The glass was shoved into his hand. \"Drink it down.\"\\n\\n \"I really don\u0027t ...\"\\n\\n A fist slammed into the same spot above his ear. Mann almost fainted from the pain.\\n\\n \"Drink it.\"\\n\\n Well, if that\u0027s what they want, why not? The quicker this nightmare is over with, the better. He took a big swallow and gagged.\\n\\n \"If I drink any more, I\u0027m gonna be sick.\"\\n\\n The man said quietly, \"If you get sick, I\u0027ll kill you.\"\\n\\n Mann looked up at him and then at his partner. There seemed to be two of everybody.\\n\\n \"What do all of you want?\" he mumbled.\\n\\n \"We told you, Mr Mann. We want you to repent.\"\\n\\n William Mann nodded drunkenly. \"Okay, I repent.\"\\n\\n The man smiled. \"You see, that\u0027s all we ask. Now ...\" He put a piece of paper in Mann\u0027s hand. \"All you have to do is write, \u0027I\u0027m sorry. Forgive me.\u0027\"\\n\\n William Mann looked up blearily. \"Tha\u0027s all?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all. And then we\u0027ll leave.\"\\n\\n He felt a sudden sense of elation. So that was what this was all about. They were religious fanatics. As soon as they left he would call the police and have them arrested. I\u0027ll see to it that the bastards are hanged.\\n\\n \"Write, Mr Mann.\"\\n\\n It was difficult for him to focus. \"What did you say you want me to write?\"\\n\\n \"Just write, \u0027I\u0027m sorry. Forgive me.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" He had difficulty holding the pen. He concentrated very hard and began to write. I\u0027m sorry. Forgive me.\\n\\n The man took the paper from Mann\u0027s hand, holding it by the edges. \"That\u0027s very good, Mr Mann. See how easy that was?\"\\n\\n The room was beginning to spin around. \"Yeah. Thank you. I\u0027ve repented. Now would you leave?\"\\n\\n \"I see that you\u0027re left-handed.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re left-handed.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s been a lot of crime around here lately, Mr Mann. We\u0027re going to give you this gun to keep.\"\\n\\n He felt a gun being placed in his left hand.\\n\\n \"Do you know how to use a gun?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s very simple. You use it like this ...\" The man lifted the gun to William Mann\u0027s temple and squeezed Mann\u0027s finger on the trigger. There was a muffled roar. The bloodstained note dropped to the floor.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all there is to it,\" one of the men said. \"Good night, Mr Mann.\"\\n\\n FLASH MESSAGE\\n\\n TOP SECRET ULTRA\\n\\n CGHQ TO DEPUTY DIRECTOR NSA\\n\\n EYES ONLY\\n\\n COPY ONE OF (ONE) COPIES\\n\\n SUBJECT: OPERATION DOOMSDAY\\n\\n 7.
