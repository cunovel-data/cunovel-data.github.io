What\u0027s going on? They told me ...\"\n \"Never mind that now. I need your help, Admiral. Have you ever heard of the name Janus?\"\n Admiral Whittaker said slowly, \"Janus? No. I never heard of him.\"\n Robert said, \"I\u0027ve found out he\u0027s heading some kind of secret organization that\u0027s killing innocent people, and now he\u0027s trying to kill me. We have to stop him.\"\n \"How can I help?\"\n \"I need to get to the President. Can you arrange a meeting?\"\n There was a moment of silence. \"I\u0027m certain I can.\"\n \"There\u0027s more. General Hilliard is involved.\"\n \"What? How ...?\"\n \"And there are others. Most of the intelligence agencies in Europe are in it, too. I can\u0027t explain any more now. I want you to call Hilliard. Tell him I\u0027ve found an eleventh witness.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand. An eleventh witness to what?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Admiral, but I can\u0027t tell you. Hilliard will know. I want him to meet me in Switzerland.\"\n \"Switzerland?\"\n \"Tell him I\u0027m the only one who knows where the eleventh witness is. If he makes one wrong move, the deal is off. Tell him to go to the Dolder Grand in Zurich. There will be a note waiting for him at the desk. Tell him I also want Janus in Switzerland, ;.n person.\"\n \"Robert, are you certain you know what you\u0027re doing?\"\n \"No, sir, I\u0027m not. But this is the only chance I\u0027ve got. I want you to tell him my conditions are not negotiable. Number one, I want safe passage to Switzerland. Number two, I want General Milliard and Janus to meet me there. Number three, after that, I want a meeting with the President of the United States.\"\n \"I will do everything I can, Robert. How will I get in touch with you?\"\n \"I\u0027ll call you back. How much time will you need?\"\n \"Give me one hour.\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"And Robert ...\"\n He could hear the pain in the old man\u0027s voice. \"Yes, sir?\"\n \"Be careful.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry, sir. I\u0027m a survivor. Remember?\"\n One hour later Robert was speaking to Admiral Whittaker again.\n \"You have a deal. General Hilliard seemed shaken by the news of another witness. He\u0027s given me his word you will not be harmed. Your conditions will be met. He\u0027s flying to Zurich and will be there tomorrow morning.\"\n \"And Janus?\"\n \"Janus will be on the plane with him.\"\n Robert felt a surge of relief. \"Thank you, Admiral. And the President?\"\n \"I spoke to him myself. His aides will arrange a meeting for you whenever you\u0027re ready.\"\n Thank God!\n \"General Hilliard has a plane to fly you to ...\"\n \"No way.\" He was not going to let them get him into a plane. \"I\u0027m in Paris. I want a car and I\u0027ll drive it myself. I want it left in front of the Hotel Littre in Montparnasse within half an hour.\"\n \"I\u0027ll see to it.\"\n \"Admiral?\"\n \"Yes, Robert?\"\n It was difficult to keep his voice steady. \"Thank you.\"\n He walked down Rue Littre, moving slowly because of the pain. He approached the hotel cautiously. Parked directly in front of the building was a black Mercedes sedan. There was no one inside. Across the street was a blue and white police car, with a uniformed policeman behind the wheel. On the sidewalk, two men in civilian clothes stood watching Robert approach. French Secret Service.\n Robert found that he was having trouble breathing. His heart was pounding. Was he stepping into a trap? The only insurance he had was the eleventh witness. Did Hilliard believe him? Was it enough?\n He walked toward the sedan, waiting for the men to make a move. They stood there, silently watching him.\n Robert moved toward the driver\u0027s side of the Mercedes and looked inside. The keys were in the ignition. He could feel the eyes of the men fastened on him as he opened the door and slid into the driver\u0027s seat. He sat there a moment, staring at the ignition. If General Hilliard had double-crossed Admiral Whittaker, this was the moment when everything would end in a violent explosion.\n Here goes. Robert took a deep breath, reached down with his left hand and turned the key. The motor purred into life. The Secret Service men stood there, watching him drive away. As Robert approached the intersection, a police car pulled in front of his car, and for a moment, Robert thought he was going to be stopped. Instead, the police turned on their red flashing light, and the traffic seemed to melt away. They\u0027re giving me a fucking escort!\n Overhead Robert heard the sound of a helicopter. He glanced up. The side of the helicopter was marked with the insignia of the French National Police. General Hilliard was doing everything possible to see that he arrived in Switzerland safely. And after I show him the last witness, Robert thought grimly, he thinks he\u0027s going to kill me. But the General is in for a surprise.\n Robert reached the Swiss border at four o\u0027clock in the afternoon. At the border, the French police car turned back, and a Swiss police car became his escort. For the first time since the affair had started, Robert began to relax. Thank God Admiral Whittaker had friends in high places. With the President expecting a meeting with Robert, General Hilliard would not dare to harm him. His mind turned to the woman in white, and at that instant, he heard her voice. The sound of it reverberated through the car.\n Hurry, Robert. We are all waiting for you.\n All? Was there more than one? I\u0027ll find out soon enough, Robert thought.\n In Zurich, Robert stopped at the Dolder Grand Hotel and wrote a note at the desk for the General.\n \"General Milliard will ask for me,\" Robert told the clerk. \"Please give this to him.\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n Outside, Robert walked over to the police car that had been escorting him. He leaned down to talk to the driver. \"From here on in, I want to be on my own.\"\n The driver hesitated. \"Very well, Commander.\"\n Robert got back in his car and started driving toward Uetendorf and the scene of the UFO crash. As he drove, he thought of all the tragedies that had occurred because of it and all the lives that had been taken. Hans Beckerman and Father Patrinl; Leslie Mothershed and William Mann; Daniel Wayne and Otto Schmidt; Lash Bushfekete and Fritz Mandel; Olga Romanchanko and Kevin Parker. Dead. All of them dead.\n I want to see the face of Janus, Robert thought, and look into his eyes.\n The villages seemed to race by, and the pristine beauty of the Alps belied all the bloodshed and terror that had started here. The car approached Thun, and Robert\u0027s adrenalin began to flow. Ahead was the field where he and Beckerman had found the weather balloon, where the nightmare had begun. Robert pulled the car over to the side of the road and switched off the engine. He said a silent prayer. Then he got out of the car, crossed the highway and went into the field.\n A thousand memories flashed through Robert\u0027s mind. The phone call at four in the morning. You are ordered to report to General Milliard at National Security Agency Headquarters at Fort Meade at 0600 this morning. Is the message understood, Commander?\n How little he had understood it then. He recalled General Hilliard\u0027s words: You must find those witnesses. All of them. And the search had led from Zurich to Bern, London, Munich, Rome and Orvieto; from Waco to Fort Smith; from Kiev to Washington, and Budapest. Well, the bloody trail had finally come to an end, here, where it had all begun.\n She was waiting for him, as Robert had known she would be, and she looked exactly as she had appeared in his dream. They moved toward each other, and she seemed to be floating toward him, a radiant smile on her face.\n Thank you for coming, Robert.\n Had he actually heard her speak, or was he hearing her thoughts? How did one talk to an alien being?\n \"I had to come,\" he said simply. There was a totally unreal quality to the scene. I\u0027m standing here speaking with someone from another world! I should be terrified, but in my whole life, I\u0027ve never felt more at peace. \"I have to warn you,\" Robert said. \"Some men are coming here who want to harm you. It would be better if you left before they arrive.\"\n I cannot leave.\n And Robert understood. He reached in his pocket with his left hand and pulled out the small piece of metal containing the crystal.\n Her face lit up. Thank you, Robert.\n He handed it to her and watched her fit it into the piece she held in her hand.\n \"What happens now?\" Robert asked.\n Now I can communicate with my friends. They will be coming for me.\n Was there something ominous in that sentence? Robert recalled General Hilliard\u0027s words: They intend to take over this planet and make slaves of us. What if General Hilliard was right? What if the aliens did intend to take over the earth? Who was going to stop them? Robert looked at his watch. It was almost time for General Hilliard and Janus to arrive, and even as Robert thought it, he heard the sound of a giant Huey helicopter approaching from the north.\n Your friends are here.\n Friends. They were his mortal enemies, and he was determined to expose them as murderers, to destroy them.\n The grass and flowers in the field began to flutter wildly as the helicopter came to a landing.\n He was about to come face to face with Janus. The thought of it filled him with a murderous rage. The door of the helicopter opened.\n Susan stepped out. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-doomsday-conspiracy/page-53.html","bookId":2363,"book":{"id":2363,"title":"The Doomsday Conspiracy","description":"Storyline: \n OPERATION DOOMSDAY \n ...
