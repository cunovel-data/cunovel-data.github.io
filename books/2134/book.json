{"id":2134,"title":"A Little Night Magic (Nodaway Falls #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Little Night Magic (Nodaway Falls #1) \n She\u0027s been working at the same Nodaway Falls, New York, waffle house since she was a teenager; not a lot of upward mobility there. She\u0027s been in love with Tobias, the cook, for the last four years; he\u0027s never made a move. Every Saturday night, she gathers with her three best friends - Peach, Millie, and Stacy - and drinks the same margaritas while listening to the same old stories. Intent on shaking things up, she puts her house on the market, buys a one-way ticket to Europe, and announces her plans to her friends... but then she meets Davina Granville, a strange and mystical Southern woman who shows Olivia that there is more to her life than she ever dreamed. As Liv\u0027s latent magical powers come to the surface, she discovers that having an interesting life is maybe not all it\u0027s cracked up to be. The dark side of someone else\u0027s magic is taking over good people in town, and changing them into vessels of malevolence. Unwilling to cede her home to darkness, she battles the demons of her familial past and her magical present, with those she loves at her side... and in the cross fire. Can the most important things in life - friendship, love, magic, and waffles - get her through the worst that the universe can throw at her?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-little-night-magic-nodaway-falls-1.jpg","author":"Lucy March","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":21,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
