{"id":94819,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"After a breakfast of Betty\u0027s incredible conjured blueberry muffins and my adequate coffee, Tobias left to get some things from his apartment, and Cain went into the living room to do something - he grumbled a few gruff words about research. Betty and I sat at my linoleum table and drank coffee and ate muffins until finally, she couldn\u0027t take it anymore.\\n\\n \"I saw Tobias coming out of your room this morning,\" she said.\\n\\n I lowered my coffee mug. \"Seriously? Everything that\u0027s going on? This is what we\u0027re going to focus on?\"\\n\\n Betty grinned. \"You bet. The best cure for times of crisis is gossip. So, tell me ... what\u0027s going on with you two?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing.\" It was the truth. I\u0027d woken up in his arms, and there was a moment of awkwardness, and then we got up and started the day. \"He slept against the door. He\u0027s just being overprotective.\"\\n\\n I must have looked really unhappy, because the hungry glint left her expression, and she simply nodded and sipped her coffee. \"Oh. Well, that\u0027s good.\"\\n\\n The doorbell rang while Betty and I were cleaning up. We exchanged a wary glance, and then we headed into the foyer, only to be cut off by Cain darting in front of me from the living room. He put his hands on my shoulders to stop me where I was, then touched his fingers to his lips. He grabbed a Clorox spray bottle from a collection of them that were sitting in a cardboard box by the door.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s he going to do?\" Betty whispered in my ear as Cain stepped up to the door and looked through the peephole. \"Disinfect her?\"\\n\\n I chuckled a little, and then Cain jerked his head toward the door, motioning for me to check out whoever it was. I walked up to the peephole and there was Stacy Easter, looking impatient on my porch.\\n\\n I stepped back and nodded at him, feeling like I was in witness protection. \"It\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n He pulled the door open, looking like a deranged Merry Maid with the Clorox bottle that, I realized now, Cain had likely spent the night emptying of antibacterial solution and replacing with magical pepper spray, or something like it. Stacy stepped inside, her eyes taking in a full drink of Cain.\\n\\n \"Hel-lo,\" she said, putting a sultry tone in her voice.\\n\\n Cain grunted and stalked off into the kitchen. Stacy looked at me. \"Where have you been hiding him?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s...\" I glanced toward the kitchen, unable to figure out a word for what Cain was. I gave up and looked back at Stacy. \"Doesn\u0027t matter. What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n She pulled a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and handed it to me. \"Not much. Your father went missing ten years ago. His last known address was in Tennessee. There\u0027s been no sign of him since. Take that to a real detective, you might have more luck.\" She pointed to the paper as I unfolded it; it was a printout of a newspaper article, on which she\u0027d scribbled an address in Avery, Tennessee, into the margin. \"Sorry, that\u0027s all I got on him.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, so what\u0027s this?\"\\n\\n \"An article from the Avery Citizen-Times,\" she said carefully. \"Is that your sister?\"\\n\\n I looked at it, and the first thing I saw was a picture of a smiling woman with long, wavy brown hair, and underneath her picture, the caption: Avery Unified teacher Holly Monroe.\\n\\n I gasped and put my hand over my mouth, then absorbed the headline.\\n\\n LOCAL TEACHER FOUND DEAD\\n\\n My hand holding the printout started to shake, so I grabbed the other side with the other hand and tried to stabilize it enough to read. I absorbed it in bits, unable to take in the whole thing at once.\\n\\n \"Livvy?\" Betty said, but I didn\u0027t look up.\\n\\n Holly Monroe found ... unidentified companion unconscious ... while police won\u0027t give out details of the scene ... possible satanic rites ... thirty-one-year-old teacher was born in Avery, and taught at Avery Unified High School since ... authorities still looking for anyone who can identify the companion, who has been unable to respond to medical staff ... African-American woman in her late forties or early fifties ... was calling the name, \"Gabriel,\" when she was first brought in, before slipping into unconsciousness ...\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n When I looked up, Cain was standing in front of the kitchen door, looking grim. But to be fair, Cain always looked grim. He stalked over to me, and I handed him the printout. He glanced at it quickly; it was obvious he\u0027d seen it before. He shot a sharp look at Stacy.\\n\\n \"Who the hell are you? What do you know about this?\"\\n\\n Betty stepped closer. \"Cain, this is Stacy.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" He advanced on her, waving the printout. \"Where\u0027d you get this?\"\\n\\n Stacy widened her stance and met his eyes. \"None of your fucking business.\"\\n\\n I touched his arm, which was taut as a wire. \"I asked her to find my father.\"\\n\\n He shifted his focus to me. \"What the hell did you do that for?\"\\n\\n \"May I repeat?\" Stacy said, stepping closer to him and drawing to her full height, which was still a foot shorter than his. \"None. Of. Your. Fucking. Business.\"\\n\\n \"Cain.\" I touched his arm again. It took him a moment to look back at me, and when our eyes met, he softened a bit, but just a bit. There was still impotent fury in his expression, but he didn\u0027t seem quite as likely to act on it.\\n\\n \"You okay?\" he asked.\\n\\n I held my hand out for the article, and he gave it back to me. I looked at the picture, trying to find something in there that said sister to me. But it was just a black-and-white shot, taken probably for a school yearbook somewhere along the line. She was beautiful; a wide smile, dark eyes, and she seemed ... I don\u0027t know. Smart. If you can tell that from a picture.\\n\\n I looked back up at Cain. \"This is what happened?\"\\n\\n Angry eyes met mine, but I could tell they weren\u0027t angry with me. \"Yeah. I went to the hospital to get Davina, but she was gone by the time I got there. Been tracking her ever since. And now, you\u0027re up to date.\"\\n\\n Every muscle in my body felt suddenly weak. I had known the story, known I had a sister who had died, known that Davina had killed her. But there was something so ... visceral about seeing her, about seeing what could have been my fate. What could still be my fate.\\n\\n \"Liv,\" Betty said, putting her arm around me, \"you go sit down in the living room. Stacy, go sit with her. I\u0027m going to make some tea. Cain - \"\\n\\n But before she could give him any instructions, the front door was slamming behind him. Betty exchanged a look with Stacy, and Stacy walked with me to the living room, where we sat down on the couch. A moment later, I heard the kitchen door swing behind Betty.\\n\\n \"So, I take it that article means something then?\" she said, motioning toward the printout in my hand.\\n\\n I nodded. \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"You want my take on things?\"\\n\\n I smiled. \"I asked you, didn\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n \"Yep. But I\u0027d tell you anyway.\" She leaned forward. \"I think your father\u0027s alive.\"\\n\\n I felt my heart skip, and I stared at her. \"You think so?\"\\n\\n \"Look. People go missing for ten years without a sign, ten-to-one, they\u0027re buried in the cement foundation of a high-rise. But whoever it was in that forest with your sister was asking for Gabriel, and why would she call the name of a man who\u0027s been dead ten years?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"But then, I don\u0027t understand a lot of it.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t need to understand,\" Stacy said. \"What does your gut tell you?\"\\n\\n I thought about that for a minute, then said, \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus Christ, Liv. Sure you do. You asked me to find him. You think he\u0027s alive, too.\"\\n\\n Hope surged within me, and I tamped it down; I had no room in my heart for hope at the moment. \"Maybe. So, what do I do now?\"\\n\\n \"Hire a real detective, for one thing,\" she said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, you did pretty well for an amateur.\" I looked at her. \"You seen Peach?\"\\n\\n Her eyes darkened. \"I just came from there. She\u0027s still a little out of it because of the painkillers. Nick\u0027s with her.\"\\n\\n I nodded. \"Can I ask you something?\"\\n\\n \"Has permission ever stopped you?\"\\n\\n \"Millie ... do you think she was always a time bomb, just waiting to go off?\"\\n\\n Stacy leaned back, stretched one arm over the back of the couch, and looked thoughtful. \"Yeah, probably.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think we can get her back from this?\"\\n\\n Stacy looked at me, then slowly shook her head.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s over, isn\u0027t it?\" I said. \"The four of us?\"\\n\\n She sighed. \"It was always going to end eventually. Peach is getting married, Millie finally toppled over the edge, and you\u0027re going away. Me, I\u0027ll always be the townie slut. I\u0027m the anchor that will keep us marginally connected, at least.\"\\n\\n She grinned at me, but I didn\u0027t smile back. \"You\u0027re more than just the townie slut.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m not ashamed,\" she said. \"And speaking of shameless, I hope you don\u0027t take this the wrong way, but I think I\u0027m in love with that man.\"\\n\\n I was so surprised by the comment that I almost laughed. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m not gonna piss in your flowerpot again but\" - she waved her hand in front of her face, and then motioned to the front door where Cain had gone - \"he is something else.\"\\n\\n \"Go ahead and piss on him,\" I said. \"He\u0027s not my flowerpot.\"\\n\\n Her eyes widened. \"Really? Because you know, he\u0027s just my type.\"\\n\\n I laughed. \"The type that will screw you senseless, give you shit, and leave you stranded?\"\\n\\n She looked at me and shrugged. \"What can I say? Daddy issues.\" She gently took the article from my hands, and said, \"You know everything\u0027s gonna be okay, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah? How would I know that?\"\\n\\n \"Because, eventually,\" she said, leaning back, \"it always is.\"\\n\\n And then, the article in her hands burst into flames.\\n\\n It was quick, less like burning and more like disintegrating. A red ridge of fire rimmed the edges and consumed the whole thing with a zip sound, until there was nothing but pieces of ash floating to the ground. Stacy didn\u0027t seem surprised at all. She shook out her hand, and as she did, I saw flickers of red light dancing around her fingertips.\\n\\n \"Wow,\" she said, swallowing. It was the first time in my life I had ever seen Stacy even remotely flustered. \"That was weird, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, crap,\" I said. \"You, too?\"\\n\\n She looked at me for a moment, then said, \"Me, too, what?\"\\n\\n I reached over to the coffee table, picked up a cork coaster, and held it in my hands. I closed my eyes and concentrated, surprising myself with how easy it was this time to draw the energy through myself, to focus it. When I put the coaster back down on the table, it was a turtle, slowly making its way across the surface.\\n\\n Stacy blinked a few times, then looked at me. \"What the fuck is going on here, Liv?\"\\n\\n \"Stacy, I\u0027m so sorry. I didn\u0027t do it on purpose, I swear - \"\\n\\n She gave me a pointed look. \"You did this to me?\"\\n\\n \"I think ... maybe. I don\u0027t know how. Something happened at that last Confessional - \"\\n\\n And then I stopped. The coffee. That Saturday morning before the girls came over, when Davina had told me about my sister, she\u0027d given me a cup of coffee.\\n\\n And I drank it.\\n\\n \"Shit.\" I shot up from my chair. \"What an idiot!\"\\n\\n I headed for the door, Stacy following closely behind, and pushed my way through. I glanced both ways down the street and didn\u0027t see Cain, so I started down the street.\\n\\n \"Liv,\" Stacy said, on my heels. \"Wanna tell me what\u0027s going on here, babe?\"\\n\\n And then Cain darted out of the narrow space between my house and Dale Hibbert\u0027s, and grabbed me by the arm.\\n\\n \"Where the hell you think you\u0027re going?\"\\n\\n \"I was looking for you.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you found me.\" He shot a suspicious look at Stacy, then said, \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"Davina, she - \"\\n\\n Cain stepped out toward the street, putting me behind him. \"What? She here?\"\\n\\n \"No, last week. Listen.\" I stepped around him to face him again. \"She gave me a cup of coffee, and I drank it.\"\\n\\n Cain\u0027s expression got even more grim, if that was possible, and he said, \"What happened?\"\\n\\n \"It was right before the girls came over last week; she brought me coffee. Later that day, I touched Peach, and there was this static electricity shock between us. I didn\u0027t think it was a big deal, but then Peach has started making things ... I don\u0027t know. Kind of dance around? And I saw this pink light on her fingers, like the yellow light that I get, and the blue light that Betty gets. And now Stacy ... there was a moment when we had a static shock thing, too, right?\"\\n\\n I looked to Stacy, who nodded. \"I thought that was weird.\"\\n\\n Cain eyed her. \"So, what\u0027s your power?\"\\n\\n \"Intense heat, apparently.\" Stacy pulled her car keys out of her pocket. One of them was wavy, as though it had been thrown into the heart of a blazing fire and then shaped around someone\u0027s fingers. \"I don\u0027t have a normal goddamned spoon left in my house.\" She tucked her useless keys back into her pocket.\\n\\n I pulled on Cain\u0027s sleeve. \"Is there something you can do? Can you reverse it?\"\\n\\n He grunted a curse, and said, \"Hell if I know. I don\u0027t know what she gave you. What\u0027d it taste like?\"\\n\\n I thought about that for a moment and shrugged. \"Coffee?\"\\n\\n \"Great,\" he breathed, annoyed, and started back toward the house, me following close behind. \"Next time a conjurer gives you something to drink, pass.\"\\n\\n \"Davina said that normal people with magic ... she said it hurts them. Should I be worried?\"\\n\\n He climbed up the steps to the front door. \"No.\"\\n\\n I grabbed his arm, and turned him to face me. \"Cain, these are my friends. If they\u0027re going to be hurt because of me...\"\\n\\n His expression changed to something approaching sympathy, then he quickly shook his head. \"The magic Davina stole hurts her because she took all of it. If your friends just got a little bit, they\u0027re probably gonna be fine. Might even wear off after a while. She probably did it to make you freak out, turn to her for help.\" He shot a quick look at Stacy, then looked back at me. \"You\u0027d need to deliberately dose someone before they\u0027d be in serious trouble, and you\u0027re not there yet.\"\\n\\n Then he went inside. I stood on the porch with Stacy for a moment, absorbing the information, and then she touched me on the arm and said, \"Did he say magic?\"\\n\\n I opened the door for her and let her in first.\\n\\n It was going to be a long afternoon.\\n\\n An hour later, Stacy sat back on my couch, turning the coaster turtle around in her hand.\\n\\n \"Magic,\" she said finally, and set it back on the coffee table, where it slowly started moving. It tended to favor its right back leg, and moved in slow, aimless circles across the surface of the coffee table. \"All right. I think my mind\u0027s wrapped around it now.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help but laugh. \"Then you\u0027re doing better than I am.\"\\n\\n The front door opened and Cain - who\u0027d been sitting guard on the porch, although I think that was as much about not having to listen to me and Stacy as it was about security - came in with Tobias behind him. Tobias had a large army-navy duffel bag over his shoulder, which he dumped on the floor by the stairwell, and they both walked over to us in silence.\\n\\n \"Hey, Tobias,\" Stacy said casually, putting her feet up on the coffee table.\\n\\n Tobias looked at Stacy, then at me.\\n\\n \"Stacy\u0027s lighting things on fire,\" I said awkwardly.\\n\\n \"Again?\" Tobias asked.\\n\\n Stacy waved one hand at him in a dramatic flourish. \"Without matches this time.\" She angled her head at me. \"Courtesy of magical Typhoid Mary over here.\" She stood up. \"Anyone want a Diet Coke?\"\\n\\n Both Tobias and Cain just looked at her, then I said, \"No, thanks, we\u0027re fine.\" Stacy shrugged and went into the kitchen.\\n\\n \"Get rid of her,\" Cain said, stepping into the living room. \"We\u0027ve got stuff to do.\"\\n\\n \"I think she\u0027s part of the team,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" Cain narrowed his eyes at me. \"And who decided that?\"\\n\\n I sat back in my chair. \"She did.\"\\n\\n \"Well, tell her she\u0027s wrong and kick her out.\"\\n\\n I shared an amused look with Tobias. \"Spoken like a man who\u0027s never tried to tell Stacy Easter what to do.\"\\n\\n Cain gave me an annoyed stare for a minute, and then cursed, and stalked off to the kitchen. Tobias, a small smile on his face, settled down across from me on the couch.\\n\\n \"How are you feeling?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Good,\" I said. \"You know, considering.\"\\n\\n We held eye contact for a little longer than absolutely necessary, but didn\u0027t speak again. From the kitchen I could hear Stacy\u0027s defiant tones overwhelming Cain\u0027s annoyed ones, and Tobias and I shared a grin. A few moments later, both Stacy and Cain came back into the living room. Stacy settled on the couch next to Tobias, sipping her Diet Coke.\\n\\n \"So,\" she said, \"I guess we\u0027re having a meeting?\" She looked from me to Tobias to Cain. \"About how to take down the magical bitch?\"\\n\\n Cain ignored her, focusing on me. \"Where\u0027s Betty?\"\\n\\n \"Taking a nap,\" I said. \"Want me to get her?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do it.\" Stacy hopped up and headed up the stairs.\\n\\n After she was out of earshot, I raised an inquisitive eyebrow at Cain. He shot me an annoyed look and grumbled, \"Fire could come in handy.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say anything.\" I got up to go sit on the couch, and Tobias put his arm around me when I settled down next to him. A minute later, Betty and Stacy walked into the living room. Stacy seemed surprised for a moment at the sight of me and Tobias together, then shrugged and sat down on the other side of me.\\n\\n \"All right,\" Cain said once everyone was settled. \"Here\u0027s the plan. Davina\u0027s gonna be weakened for a while, but I say she makes a move tomorrow night, Friday at the latest. She\u0027s angry, she\u0027s desperate, and she\u0027s running out of cards to play, so the play\u0027s gonna get dirty.\"\\n\\n I tensed up. \"The play hasn\u0027t been dirty?\"\\n\\n Cain looked at me, but didn\u0027t answer. \"She\u0027s strong at night, so during the day, we won\u0027t find her if she doesn\u0027t want to be found. The only way to end this thing is to draw her out when she\u0027s feeling secure.\" Cain looked at me. \"That means, at night.\"\\n\\n My heart clutched in my chest. \"But I don\u0027t have any power at night.\"\\n\\n \"Do what I tell you, you won\u0027t need it. She needs to come after you when she thinks you\u0027re weak. That\u0027s at night. We send you out on your own to someplace, she follows you, tries to make her move and then...\" He looked grimly around the group. \"Then you let me take care of it.\"\\n\\n I felt a chill at the coldness in his voice. \"What do you mean, take care of it?\"\\n\\n He met my eye. \"That\u0027s my concern. Your job is getting her to me.\"\\n\\n \"So you can do what?\"\\n\\n Cain stayed quiet, and Stacy said, \"You\u0027re going to kill her.\" Cain turned his icy look on Stacy and she held it for a moment, then looked at me. \"Yeah, he\u0027s definitely going to kill her.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t,\" I said automatically. \"No.\"\\n\\n Cain looked at me, annoyed. \"She\u0027d break your neck without a second thought if it\u0027d get her what she wanted. What are you protecting her for?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not protecting her. But I\u0027m not a killer, either.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to be,\" he said. \"This is my thing, and I\u0027m gonna get her with or without you. Be easier with you, but either way, that woman is getting put down.\"\\n\\n The hardness in his eyes scared me. Cain had never been exactly fluffy, but all the rage simmering underneath was coming to the surface now, and I felt like things were getting quickly out of control. I looked at Betty.\\n\\n \"Is it just me who thinks talking about killing people is insane?\"\\n\\n Betty took in a deep breath and shook her head carefully. \"It\u0027s not just you.\"\\n\\n Stacy shrugged. \"I say the bitch started it, but then, I wanna kill someone at least twice a day, so...\"\\n\\n Betty looked at Cain. \"I know Holly was important to you, and I\u0027m sorry about what happened, but isn\u0027t there a way to protect Liv without killing anyone?\"\\n\\n Cain\u0027s cold eyes met hers. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe that,\" I said. \"If she could steal Holly\u0027s magic, maybe we can just ... I don\u0027t know. Steal it back. Then she\u0027d be relatively harmless.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027d still be a conjurer, and a damn powerful one at that,\" Cain said. \"Soon as she healed up, she\u0027d be back for you. You wanna spend the rest of your life with her on your tail?\"\\n\\n \"No, but - \"\\n\\n Cain slammed his hand down on the coffee table, sending a sharp report throughout the room.\\n\\n \"She killed Holly!\" His voice was full of rage and heartbreak, and while he pulled the emotion back in quickly, it was clear what his dog in this fight was, and it had nothing to do with protecting me. The room went quiet, and I had no idea what to say, but Tobias did.\\n\\n \"Have you ever killed anyone, Cain?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Cain said, a sharp bite in his tone as he turned angry eyes on Tobias. \"You?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Tobias said, and the room went silent. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-little-night-magic-nodaway-falls-1/page-16.html","bookId":2134,"book":{"id":2134,"title":"A Little Night Magic (Nodaway Falls #1)","description":"Storyline: A Little Night Magic (Nodaway Falls #1) \\n She\u0027s been working at the same Nodaway Falls, New York, waffle house since she was a teenager; not a lot of upward mobility there.
