{"id":94824,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"A week later, Betty moved in. \"Stop treating me like a damn invalid,\" she said when I carried the last of her things to her room, where I\u0027d made her sit on the bed while I puttered around her. \"I\u0027m fine.\" \"The doctor said you needed to rest for your first few days back.\" I set the suitcase of clothes Grace and Addie had rescued from her apartment down next to the bed. \"You rest, or so help me, I\u0027ll duct tape you to that bed. What do you want for lunch?\" \"I don\u0027t want lunch,\" she said. \"I want you to sit down for five minutes and talk to me.\" I hesitated for a moment. I\u0027d spent the last week keeping busy, managing Millie\u0027s funeral, visiting Betty in the hospital, preparing the house for her to move in. Ordinary, mundane tasks had been my lifeline, and the idea of sitting and talking didn\u0027t necessarily appeal. But, since I\u0027d never actually won an argument with Betty, I sat down at the desk chair and said, \"What do you want to talk about?\" \"I want to talk about you,\" she said. \"How are you doing?\" I smiled. \"I\u0027m fine.\" She stared at me, and I relented. \"I\u0027m okay. I\u0027m ... managing. The night magic takes a little getting used to, it\u0027s like it never turns off, you know?\" \"Have you slept?\" \"Sure.\" Not a full night, not more than a couple hours at a time, but I had slept. The nightmares were getting less and less frequent, so progress was being made. \"I\u0027m sleeping fine.\" She nodded, but I could tell she didn\u0027t believe me. We fell into a silence, and then she said, \"You know it\u0027s not your fault, right?\" Her expression tightened a bit, and she added, \"Everything that happened with Millie.\" \"I know.\" There was a noise down by my ankle, and I looked down to see Gibson bumping into the side of the bed. I glanced up to see Niles floating in circles above Gib, and I smiled as I picked Gibson up. \"Well, that\u0027s weird,\" Betty commented. \"They\u0027re inseparable,\" I said. \"I think it\u0027s sweet.\" \"It is sweet,\" she said. \"But your piece of paper\u0027s in love with your mug. It\u0027s also weird.\" I gave her a small nod. \"I concede the point.\" I got up, opened the empty bottom dresser drawer, and set Gibson into it to keep him safe for the time being. Niles floated down next to him and settled into the drawer as well. \"Weird.\" She sighed. \"Still no word from Cain?\" \"Nope, and I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll get any.\" By the morning after the showdown with Davina, Cain had disappeared. Stacy had talked about tracking him down, but I figured we wouldn\u0027t see him again until he wanted to be seen. I hoped that would happen someday, but who knew? Cain wasn\u0027t a terribly predictable kind of guy. \"So, what did you do with the body? Are we worried about Tobias going to jail? Do we need to find a good lawyer?\" I sat back down on the edge of the bed. \"You know, Betty, we don\u0027t have to discuss - \" \"I. Am. Not. An. Invalid,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve danced around this when I was in the hospital and I couldn\u0027t come after you because they had tubes in me. Now, however, I will hurt you.\" I sighed. \"It\u0027s possible that people might come around asking about Davina, but Cain said she didn\u0027t have any family, or friends, or any kind of employment that he was aware of, so if no one reports her missing, we\u0027re probably okay just not saying anything about it. But, just in case, Stacy took care of it.\" Betty\u0027s brows knit for a second. \"Stacy?\" And then her face cleared. \"Right. Fire. So she...?\" \"Cremated her. Right there in the forest, and didn\u0027t catch anything else on fire. The girl had talent.\" Betty raised her brow. \"Had?\" \"It was borrowed power, both her and Peach. Yesterday, Stacy had trouble lighting a match head.\" I remembered the disappointment on Stacy\u0027s face, and how she\u0027d stalked away after the failure. \"Possibly, that\u0027s a good thing.\" \"I think maybe,\" Betty said. \"And what about Millie?\" I sighed. Millie\u0027s death had been harder to explain. We brought her in, told the hospital that we\u0027d found her in the forest, and for lack of a better explanation for her injuries, they had deduced suicide by hanging. The note found at her apartment, written in Millie\u0027s careful hand, confirmed this, and we didn\u0027t say any different to anyone. I tried not to think about Millie, sitting alone at her desk, being forced to write the note against her will as Davina controlled her every move, but I couldn\u0027t get the image out of my head anyway. It was a small comfort that her fate had been sealed before we\u0027d ever walked into that forest; Davina was never not going to end Millie that night, no matter what I did. \"I don\u0027t think anyone\u0027s going to question the suicide,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not like Millie was the most balanced person in the world, even before Davina got here.\" Betty nodded. \"When\u0027s the memorial service?\" I looked down at my hands. \"Tomorrow.\" She reached over and took my hand, and we sat in silence for a little while, then I worked up a smile and said, \"I have some gossip for you.\" Betty\u0027s face lit up. \"Oh, thank god. I was starting to get the shakes.\" \"Peach and Nick are back together. I\u0027m not sure if they\u0027re re-engaged or not, but he\u0027s moving in next weekend.\" Her expression flattened. \"Oh, hell. Addie told me about that two days ago.\" \"Sorry. You\u0027ll get better gossip once we get CCB\u0027s back up and running. Speaking of which, work is coming along. Did Ray talk to you? He was supposed to tell you when he thinks it might be done.\" \"He swears by late August,\" Betty said. \"Which in contractor speak means January at the earliest.\" \"Well, you can stay here as long as you need to,\" I said. \"Of course I can. You blew up my home and business.\" We shared a smile, and then she said, \"And how\u0027s Tobias?\" I sighed. \"I don\u0027t know. We haven\u0027t talked much since...\" I lowered my eyes. \"You know.\" She nodded. \"Yeah.\" \"I think he\u0027s worried that I\u0027ll never see him the same way again,\" I said. \"And I\u0027m worried that he\u0027ll never forgive me.\" \"Forgive you? For what?\" I thought back to that moment when I\u0027d told him to leave, and I cringed once again at my own hubris and stupidity. \"I was the reason Davina got him. He tried to take her down on his own because I\u0027d sent him away. Then he killed her to save me.\" Betty reached out and patted my hand. \"Oh. Idiots in love. So heartwarming. And annoying.\" She reached up and gave me a light, playful slap on the face. \"Talk to him.\" \"I know,\" I said. \"I will. I just wanted to give him a little time.\" I didn\u0027t mention that I needed time, too. It would be a little while before I could gracefully handle bad news from that sector of my life. At that moment, through the open window, the sparkly magic-square bluebird flew in through the window and landed on my shoulder. I smiled at it. \"Told you that square was magic,\" I said. Betty laughed. \"I\u0027ll never doubt you again.\" \"Damn straight.\" I took him off my shoulder and put him into the decorative cage that I\u0027d brought into Betty\u0027s room. \"I thought maybe you might like to keep him.\" She got up and walked over to me, looking at the bird in the cage. I put my arm around her shoulders and hugged her to me. There were moments, more frequent with every day, in which the darkness from that night got chased away. When Tobias smiled at me, when Stacy and Peach came over with another crazy martini recipe to drink over rented movies; and now, with Betty next to me, healed and marveling at the magic-square bluebird. \"What are you going to name him?\" I asked as she straightened up. \"I don\u0027t know. Linoleum?\" I laughed. \"How about Linus?\" \"Yeah,\" she said, angling her head at the bird. \"Linus sounds good.\" That Saturday, Peach and Stacy and I gathered on my patio after Millie\u0027s memorial service, a tray of margaritas sitting untouched on the table as we stood by my mother\u0027s garden of wildflowers. I held the urn containing Millie\u0027s ashes tightly against my stomach, then placed it in the middle of the garden, next to a similar urn that held my mother\u0027s ashes. We didn\u0027t say anything for a long time, just stood there, the three of us holding hands. Tears dropped from Peach\u0027s face and she swiped at them periodically. Stacy\u0027s eyes were dry, but her hand clutched mine tight, and I could feel her pain reflecting my own as we stared down at the earthly remains of the woman we had all loved as a sister. \"I wish I\u0027d gotten the chance to tell her I forgive her,\" Peach said finally, sniffling. She looked at me, her eyes red-rimmed and overflowing. \"You know, for all that with Nick.\" I nodded toward the urn. \"Tell her now.\" Peach\u0027s lower lip trembled, and she released my hand, then stepped forward. She lowered her head and said, \"It\u0027s okay. I forgive you, Millie. And I love you.\" Her voice cracked on this last part. She blew a kiss to the urn, stepped back, and joined the three of us again. I turned to Stacy. \"Is there anything you want to say to her?\" Stacy shook her head. \"I don\u0027t forgive so easily.\" \"Then tell her,\" I said. Stacy watched me for a minute, her expression hard but contemplative, and then she stepped forward. \"You were stupid,\" she said. \"You had friends. We would have helped you. You didn\u0027t need to do what you did, and you didn\u0027t need to die, you dumbass.\" She stood there, her back to us, for a while, and I saw her swipe at her eyes before turning back to face us. \"Your turn,\" she said to me. I stepped forward, staring down into the wildflowers my mother had cultivated so absently for all those years, simply so she\u0027d have something to stare at while she thought about my father. And now here they were, together, my mother who had replaced Millie\u0027s missing one, and Millie, who had given my mother the second daughter she\u0027d lost. It was a tragic end to a tragic tale, and there was only one thing I could think of to say. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. I turned to Peach and Stacy, and we nodded at each other, then walked to the patio table where our margaritas had been waiting. At the base of Millie\u0027s urn, one by one, we poured our drinks into the ground, and then went inside. \"Step away from the square, Kiskey.\" I looked up from my feet. In the two weeks since reconstruction had started, our first major hurdle - CCB\u0027s dining-room floor - was finally done, complete with one blue sparkly square, just a few feet from where Booth 9 would someday be, and right next to where I was futilely attempting to sweep up the endless construction dust at the moment. \"Hey, stranger,\" I said as Tobias crossed the sunny dining room to where I was standing. He stopped a few feet away, and tucked his hands in his jean pockets, his hunched posture reminding me vaguely of a little boy about to get scolded. This was only the third time I\u0027d seen him since that night, and the first time since Millie\u0027s memorial service, where he\u0027d disappeared before we got the chance to talk to each other, so I could see why he was a little worried about how I\u0027d respond to seeing him again. I was a little worried, myself. \"I\u0027m sorry I haven\u0027t been around,\" he said after a while. \"It\u0027s okay. I understand.\" I gripped the broom handle tightly in my hand, curling it in to me. \"I knew things were busy for you,\" he said, \"with putting this place back together, and the memorial service and everything.\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Thank you for coming, by the way.\" \"Of course.\" He hesitated a moment, then said, \"So, how are you doing? You okay?\" I nodded, and looked up at him. \"You?\" He shook his head, but kept his eyes on mine. \"No. Not really.\" I took in a breath and lowered my eyes as my heart beat raggedly in my chest. \"Oh.\" \"I miss you.\" I looked up at him. \"You do?\" \"I know you probably don\u0027t want to see me - \" \"Don\u0027t want to see you?\" \" - after everything that happened - \" \"Are you insane?\" He blinked, his eyes uncomprehending. \"You watched me kill someone.\" \"Yeah, while saving my life. I thought you didn\u0027t want to see me, because it was all my fault.\" He took a step toward me. \"No. You just seemed so upset whenever you looked at me. I thought I upset you.\" \"I was upset because my best friend died,\" I said. \"And because it\u0027s a little traumatizing when a magical wingnut tries to kill you. Mostly, I was upset because I missed you, but I didn\u0027t want to push because I thought...\" I trailed off, and then we both laughed, and I said without thinking, \"Idiots in love.\" His smile faded a bit, and I cringed. \"I\u0027m sorry ... I didn\u0027t mean ... it\u0027s just something Betty said.\" \"No, we\u0027re definitely idiots in love,\" he said, his expression serious. \"At least, one of us is.\" \"An idiot or in love?\" I said. \"And are you talking about you or me?\" \"Are you still going to Europe?\" he asked, ignoring my question. I took a breath. \"Yeah. Two weeks from Friday.\" \"Oh.\" He nodded, swallowed, and pulled on a smile. \"It\u0027ll be good for you to get away.\" \"It\u0027s just ... I already bought the ticket and got my passport...\" \"No, no. That\u0027s good.\" He forced a full smile. \"That\u0027ll be good for you.\" \"I\u0027m coming back,\" I said. His brow, which had furrowed a bit, smoothed out in surprise. \"You are?\" I nodded. \"I changed my ticket to return after two weeks.\" \"Oh. Good.\" He smiled and we stood there in awkward silence for a long moment. Then I let the broom clatter to the floor, took his face in my hands, and kissed him. He kissed me back, his arms wrapping naturally around my waist. We indulged in each other for a while, and then I pulled back to look at him. \"I love you,\" I said. \"I will always love you, and nothing in the world is ever going to change that, so I\u0027m accepting it now, and I\u0027m telling you. No more idiots in love.\" He smiled. \"No more idiots in love.\" He leaned in and kissed me again, then hugged me tight. \"I love you,\" he whispered into my ear. \"I\u0027ve been miserable these past few weeks.\" \"Me, too. Let\u0027s not do that again.\" \"Deal.\" He released me, and I reached up and touched his face, my smile widening as the tension drained from me. \"Come to Europe with me.\" His expression darkened a bit. \"I can\u0027t.\" \"Oh.\" I lowered my hand. \"Okay.\" \"I want to, but if I leave the country without telling the company...\" \"Hell. You have to get permission? Really?\" He nodded. \"And if they think I\u0027m a flight risk, they could come take me.\" \"A flight risk? Jesus, what are you? A prisoner?\" He nodded. \"Yeah. Kinda. But ... go. Have your fun in Europe. Get away, and have a good time. You\u0027ve earned it.\" He took a step forward, put his warm palm against my cheek, and looked deep into my eyes. \"Then come back to me.\" \"I will.\" I put my arms around his neck and hugged him to me. \"And take a picture with every goat,\" he said. \"I want you to be reminded how much I love you every time you see one.\" I stepped back and looked up at him. \"Oh, hell.\" \"What?\" \"Goats are gonna be a thing with us now,\" I said. \"Every anniversary for the rest of my life, I\u0027m gonna get goats. I can see it now. Goat stationery, goat slippers, stuffed goats.\" He smiled. \"Or real ones.\" I laughed. \"I\u0027m gonna be lousy with goats, just like Europe.\" \"No,\" he said. \"We\u0027re going to be lousy with goats.\" I smiled up at him. \"Damn right, we are,\" I said, and then he took me into his arms, and we stopped talking.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-little-night-magic-nodaway-falls-1/page-21.html","bookId":2134,"book":{"id":2134,"title":"A Little Night Magic (Nodaway Falls #1)","description":"Storyline: A Little Night Magic (Nodaway Falls #1) She\u0027s been working at the same Nodaway Falls, New York, waffle house since she was a teenager; not a lot of upward mobility there.
