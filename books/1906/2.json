{"id":87346,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"The house was so Lisette. Wrapped up in the lush stillness of the maritime forest, the combination of stone and natural wood siding made the home a part of the green and brown world around it. Half of the house\u0027s square footage was built inside the steep hillside.Though the architecture was impressive, the house was not ostentatious in size.\\n\\n Lauren found the inside the same. Quality, not quantity, was the guiding force that had furnished the interior. The kitchen area was decorated in a warm blue with white counters and clean stainless steel that invited culinary experiments. Barstools pulled up to the white counters invited observers to gather around, chat and drink wine.\\n\\n The spacious refrigerator and deep pantry had been stocked with groceries, bottled water and basic condiments. By the mysterious Josh, Lauren assumed. She had escaped responsibility in every sense.\\n\\n She carried her bags into the living area, which had deep carpeting, a cozy horseshoe of couches with recliner options and inviting chairs and ottomans gathered around a beveled glass coffee table. The glass was held up on the tail fronds and slender hands of a mermaid carved out of a pale bleached wood. A stereo cabinet was tucked discreetly in a corner, so nothing distracted from the panoramic view offered by the wall of windows before the sitting area. There was a sliding glass door out to a deck that overlooked the lush ravine below, canopied by the graceful arms of the trees, which, if one raised the gaze, framed the distant, panoramic view of the ocean.\\n\\n It made the decision of what to do with her first afternoon easy. Lauren took time to put away some of her things, but as soon as the essentials of settling in were handled, she stripped down. She wrapped herself in a towel and stepped out onto the deck, her eye on the hot tub she had turned on to heat up while she had unpacked.\\n\\n The tub was surrounded by a Japanese rock garden and a forest of exotic plants. Keeping them alive was another task of Josh\u0027s, she assumed, since Lisette\u0027s busy schedule only allowed her to spend a couple months a year here. Lisette had told her the plants were potted in an array of interesting cast-off pieces offered to her by another island part-time resident. Art appreciation was an avid hobby; there was not a gallery or museum floor in Atlanta, or on any of her other travels, that had not been imprinted with Lauren\u0027s footsteps. She recognized the \"cast-offs\" as the work of a potter whose work went in New York galleries for four figures.\\n\\n While she soaked, Lauren looked down and watched the myriad of wildlife that roamed, unconcerned, through the ravine, and the birds that flitted from branch to branch in the trees. An hour or more passed in that simple fashion, and after a time, her thoughts left her alone, so that she could simply gaze at the world around her, and be a quiet part of it.\\n\\n Her growling stomach finally made her decide it was time to rise. She tucked a towel around her breasts and gave some thought to dinner. She had bought wine and goat cheese from a native vendor at the small airport, and there was a small box of Belgian chocolates and the makings for a green salad in the fridge that looked tempting. Savoring that meal and plunging into the first of the ten novels she\u0027d downloaded to her handheld electronic reader sounded perfect.\\n\\n She put her hand on the sliding door and pushed. Lauren frowned, shoved again. She glanced down. In dismay, she saw that the door had a safety rod. Made to lay down in the track of the doorframe to prevent the door from being forced open, it had apparently fallen into place when she had come out on the deck. It effectively trapped her there.\\n\\n Well. She looked about, expecting there might be some way out of her predicament. There were no stairs off the deck, and no windows within her reach. Annoyance was her first thought. She couldn\u0027t imagine why a \"sticky fingered fisherman\" would scale up a tree to the deck.\\n\\n There was no reason to panic. If she had to, she could pick up one of those cast off pots and smash it through the double paned glass window of the sliding door, but she certainly didn\u0027t want to take that tack until she\u0027d thought all other options through.\\n\\n She sat down on the edge of the tub and took another swallow of her wine, considering her surroundings more carefully.\\n\\n Lisette had kept the large trees around the deck relatively unpruned. Lauren could only imagine what it had been like to construct the house within the span of the branches. It had to have been an architect\u0027s dream and a builder\u0027s nightmare. She suspected there were contractors on the mainland who could not pass a Lisette Delamar book without shuddering. However, the arms of one particularly impressive specimen reached out and over the deck, so close that a terra cotta birdfeeder had been anchored there.\\n\\n Lauren stepped to the rail.\\n\\n The crotch of the tree would require about twenty-five feet of downward climb to reach, but the branch that could take her there was solid, with the circumference of a telephone pole. Once reaching the juncture, it would be a bit trickier, because it was about fifteen to twenty feet above the ground, and the tree\u0027s roots clung to the steep incline, giving the trunk the one hundred and ten degree angle of a woodpecker. However, she might be able to work her way down the trunk on that leeward side.\\n\\n Just like sailing, she hadn\u0027t climbed a tree in some time, but she climbed the rope at the gym. She climbed it with furious intent, combating her gender\u0027s frustrating upper body weakness with a passion that she knew suggested she was fighting other, more personal weaknesses with her workouts.\\n\\n No time for personal angst. She could do this. She rewrapped the towel about her waist and knotted it on the side, leaving her breasts exposed like a bleached National Geographic native. She was isolated here, and it wasn\u0027t likely the towel would hold firm tucked around her bosom. However, the terry cloth would provide her legs some protection from the rough bark.\\n\\n She did a couple of stretches, touched her toes, and twisted back and forth. The hot tub had already loosened her up, so with a fortifying swig of wine, she was ready to play Jane. Or maybe Tarzan. Jane would be waiting for Tarzan to come rescue her, never realizing he was banging some Amazon and couldn\u0027t be bothered with some whiny city girl.\\n\\n She smiled at the thought and stood up on the rail. The branch was now level with her waist. It was simple to lean over, grasp it with both hands and slide herself onto it like a horse\u0027s back. The bark scraped the tender underside of her breasts and rasped over her left nipple, leaving a red mark on the white skin.\\n\\n She looked down into the green abyss of the ravine, which was thirty or a hundred feet down, depending on the side of the branch from which she fell. She rethought the idea of going back and breaking the window. It was an acceptable option if the alternative was plunging to her death or certain maiming in the forest below.\\n\\n Nonsense. She was a strong, healthy woman, capable of climbing down a tree. It wasn\u0027t much higher than the rope. She didn\u0027t look down when she climbed the rope. That was the main difference.\\n\\n She managed to wriggle down a good ten feet before her foot touched a branch, an offspring of her present perch. Unfortunately, in its quest for sunlight, this branch had curved upward, so she would have to maneuver around it, an obstacle in her road. Lauren sat up, bracing her hands on the bark between her thighs, and let her legs swing. Her bare back rested against the upward curving branch, forming a chair, and she relaxed a moment, or tried to do so.\\n\\n Why was she in such a hurry? She didn\u0027t have dinner on the stove, wasn\u0027t expecting company. Lauren swallowed, remembering when she had expected someone.\\n\\n She and Jonathan had lived together only a month. From the first day, he had balked at anything that smacked of the \"how-was-your-day-dear?\" rut, as he called it, describing it in disparaging terms as the innocuous brushing of lips, the sacking out on the couch in front of the TV after exchanging less than two sentences.\\n\\n So to keep him happy, she ordered him to come home from work earlier than her, every night. He was to put away his briefcase, lawyer\u0027s suit and tie, and make her dinner. He would then kneel by the door, eyes gazing at the floor. He would be wearing nothing unless she had specified something in particular.\\n\\n She would come in, dressed impeccably in her skirted suit; hose and heels take his hand and raise him to his feet. He wasn\u0027t to lift his gaze. All subs tried occasionally, they couldn\u0027t help themselves, and those brief, forbidden glimpses were full of such naked hunger a Dom could not help but be aroused by a single look.\\n\\n Not Jonathan. He never had a problem with that, unless he wanted to be punished. He would serve her dinner, and then she might make him kneel under the table and serve her another way while she drank her wine and caressed his hair, even as her body flushed with pleasure and she gasped at the touch of his lips or clever fingers.\\n\\n Lauren broke into a sweat, and tears pricked her eyelids. She had come here to get away from these cursed memories. She told herself it was just a physical thing. She was feeling deprived. It was the way the tree rubbed her through the towel as she sat, swinging her legs. As the thought occurred to her, she lifted herself up so that the lips between her legs brushed lightly against the cloth-covered bark. Goose pimples ran up and down her skin. What was unpleasant on bare skin was not so unpleasant when covered with a thick cotton barrier. Oh, yes, tree climbing definitely had its up side.\\n\\n She had gotten so she could get herself off with anything. When she finally came, the combination of intense physical pleasure and unbearable emotional anguish left her limp in mind and body. In those dark moments, her subconscious rose to the surface and laughed at her conscious mind\u0027s proud insistence that it was just the fulfillment of a physical need Jonathan had taken away from her.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t a liar. Not to herself or to anyone else. It was just a way of coping. She knew it was more than just having him naked at her door. It was looking around the corner and seeing his briefcase sitting in their bedroom, the evidence of existing together, sharing everything. In reality, all they had ever shared was sex and the game. Why had it been so hard to see that?\\n\\n No-brainer question. Because she had wanted so much not to see it.\\n\\n What cruelty made you give your heart on a platter to someone who didn\u0027t want it? It was so painful to have them politely dismiss it . No thank you, none for me please. She\u0027d almost rather a lover attack her heart with knife and fork, consume it in three bites and throw it back up later. At least that was action, passion.\\n\\n Lauren shook her head. She would rather have her heart hacked up like a hairball than left intact and unaccepted. There was a mental image. She needed to get a grip and stop thinking so damn much, or she was going to drown in pathetic metaphors.\\n\\n Lauren contemplated the ravine below, all the mysteries of life moving among the foliage. The cycles of birth, life, death, beginning and ending in every moment. There was a majestic hush over it all, each sound resonating like music on a scrolled page. The calling of the birds, the rustle of the leaves in the wind, the soft snap of branches and staccato tap of animals moving along the paths known only to them. So different from the human world. Humans knew nothing of harmony with the world about them. They were so dedicated to enhancing their single note; they couldn\u0027t begin to figure out how to make a song.\\n\\n The cool air of twilight touched her with questing fingers, as if just noticing her. Lauren closed her eyes and felt it stroke her hair off her nape and shiver down her torso, learning what manner of creature she might be. She concentrated on the stillness, seeing if she could somehow, by bringing that stillness into herself, make it dissolve the memories that refused to stop haunting her. She had to come to terms with them, and with herself.\\n\\n She became more conscious of her breathing, and could almost sense that there were others who breathed with her in the impending night, creatures with liquid brown eyes and twitching noses, and musky soft fur that smelled of earth and animal.\\n\\n Lauren slowly opened her eyes, not sure how long she had been lost in the meditative state.\\n\\n Long enough that the air had gotten colder, and the sun had disappeared into the horizon, though it still illuminated the sky. She sighed, looked down, and found she was no longer alone. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/holding-the-cards-nature-of-desire-1/page-2.html","bookId":1906,"book":{"id":1906,"title":"Holding The Cards (Nature of Desire #1)","description":"Storyline: Holding The Cards (Nature of Desire #1) \\n Lauren is a successful doctor with a healthy attitude toward sex, unashamed of her proclivities as a sexual dominant.
