{"id":63001,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"It seems your Mrs. Morgan took her carriage north and sailed from Dover,\" Smithe announced, lifting his tea to his lips for a sip before continuing. \"The ship was heading for Calais. I have passage booked for myself and two of my men leaving tomorrow morning. We will search for her, follow if she traveled across land from there, or question her if we find she is still in Calais.\" \"Good,\" Robert murmured, thinking this could all be done and dusted quickly if Mrs. Morgan was staying in Calais. The sooner they found out who the suitor was, the sooner he could handle the man and get the hell back to his own life and stop being tortured by watching Lisa with her gaggle of gentlemen callers. After having to witness her dancing with nearly every other single man in London last night, not to mention being forced to stand by and watch Findlay paw and kiss her out on the terrace, Robert didn\u0027t think he could stand much more of this job he\u0027d given himself. He\u0027d rather hoped that today Daniel or Richard would be here to keep an eye on her so that he could go visit his mistress and work off some of the excess energy and frustration that was presently building in him. However, none of them had expected this turn of events and today, like yesterday, Richard and Daniel already had prior engagements, meaning Robert was once again on duty. Even Christiana and Suzette were away again at one of the charity teas they had taken to aiding in. Not that he would have left Lisa with just the women to watch her, but their presence in the parlor would have meant he could at least avoid it himself and simply watch from the office with that door open to be sure Lisa didn\u0027t try to slip out with her admirers for another phaeton race or some such thing. \"Of course, I doubt Morgan stayed in Calais. Paris is much more likely a place for her to set up trade again,\" Smithe commented. \"I suspect traveling to Calais was just a red herring to try to lead us off the trail.\" Robert sank back in his seat with a sigh. Paris was a large city and Mrs. Morgan wouldn\u0027t exactly be flaunting her presence. She wouldn\u0027t want to be found. It could take days to track her, days he would rather not have to wait and watch over Lisa. \"But I shall return as quickly as I can, either with the information of who paid her to kidnap Miss Madison, or the lady herself,\" Smithe assured him. \"Yes, of course. Thank you,\" Robert said grimly. The man could only do as much as he could do. Wishing it was otherwise wouldn\u0027t make it so. \"Don\u0027t thank me, my lord, until I bring back what you want,\" Smithe suggested calmly. \"Then you can thank me with coins.\" Robert smiled faintly. \"Of course. Speaking of that, you will need a draft to cover your expenses.\" \"Yes, I will,\" Smithe said simply and suggested a sum that seemed reasonable to Robert. He quickly wrote up the draft and slid it across the desk to the man, then stood to see him out. This time when he returned to the parlor and opened the door, Lisa and her admirers were all still present. Forcing his shoulders up and a bland smile to his lips, Robert slipped inside and positioned himself unobtrusively beside the largest flower arrangement in the room. It was one of several. While Pembroke had brought her pastries, Tibald and the other men had all brought collections of flowers. The room was positively awash in fresh, colorful blooms. But the loveliest flower in the room was Lisa. Rosy-cheeked and beaming under all this attention, she held court, smiling and laughing, teasing and chattering. He didn\u0027t think he\u0027d ever seen her look quite so happy or adorable. She positively shone under the admiration of all these men, drawing every eye and even more appreciation from her callers. \"I was hoping to arrange for a ride down the river for this afternoon since you mentioned enjoying that. But, I fear I couldn\u0027t arrange it all on such short notice.\" Pembroke\u0027s words caught Robert\u0027s ear, drawing his attention to the conversation taking place. \"However, if you would be pleased, I have managed to rent a boat for the day after tomorrow to take a large party up the coast for a picnic.\" \"Oh, how lovely,\" Lisa said, clapping her hands happily. \"Who all shall be there?\" \"The invitations are being prepared and delivered as we speak,\" Pembroke said. \"I have invited everyone here, of course.\" His expression was tight as he nodded toward the other men in the room and it was obvious, at least to Robert, that he hadn\u0027t been pleased to do so. \"As well as your sisters and their husbands, Lord Langley,\" He nodded at Robert who had thought his entrance had gone unnoticed. \"And I have invited several other single young ladies who are making their debut this year to add to the numbers.\" And to hopefully keep the other men occupied, Robert supposed with amusement. Though he doubted that would work. In his opinion, no woman stood a chance next to Lisa. All these other women would do was make her value even more obvious. But bully to Pembroke for trying it, he thought. \"That sounds lovely,\" Lisa said happily and the men all murmured their agreement, though a little less enthusiastically, he noted, and guessed they were wishing they\u0027d thought of it. Much to his relief the visitation ended shortly after that when Findlay suggested they should leave Lisa to rest before she had to prepare for that night\u0027s ball. There was a general, if disappointed, murmur of agreement from the other men and they all began to slowly gather their things and make their departure. Robert stood silently by while Lisa saw each man off with a smile and assurances that she\u0027d enjoyed their company. While Findlay was the first to suggest it might be time they left, he was the last to actually leave, dallying until an annoyed Pembroke finally shuffled out the door. Lisa wasn\u0027t the only one to turn a curious gaze on Charles Findlay once the others had left. Robert eyed him suspiciously, sure the man had hoped he would leave them alone for a moment, but Robert had stood by and watched him grope Lisa last night and that was enough. He wasn\u0027t doing it again, he decided grimly, and simply raised an eyebrow at Findlay when he glanced his way expectantly. Apparently coming to the realization that he wouldn\u0027t be left alone with Lisa, Findlay smiled wryly and then reached into his inside coat pocket as he approached her. His expression was somewhat chagrined as he pulled out three slender books. \"I didn\u0027t wish to give these to you in front of the others,\" he admitted, offering them to her. \"Oh, Charles,\" Lisa breathed, taking the books as if they were the finest jewels. Robert immediately scowled at her use of the man\u0027s first name, but neither of them noticed. \"I wasn\u0027t sure what you enjoy reading, and I haven\u0027t read any of these myself, but a friend assured me you should like them,\" Findlay said uncertainly, and then frowned and added, \"I hope you haven\u0027t read them yet.\" \"No,\" she said at once, quickly checking each title to be sure. Lisa then glanced up and beamed, before simply throwing her arms around him and hugging him tightly. \"What a wonderful man! These are the perfect gift.\" \"Oh, well,\" Findlay chuckled faintly and let his arms slip around her back. He started to tighten his arms around her as well, but then his eyes suddenly shot to Robert and he eased his hold and then stepped back, releasing her. \"I should be going. You probably do wish to rest before having to prepare for tonight\u0027s ball.\" \"Thank you,\" Lisa said sincerely, clasping the books to her chest as she walked him from the room and to the front door. \"I shall start reading one right away and tell you what I think tonight.\" \"I\u0027d like that,\" Findlay assured her. \"And perhaps we could go for a picnic sometime later in the week and you could read to me. Or I could read to you. Or we could take turns reading to each other.\" \"That sounds lovely,\" she agreed with a grin. The hell it did, Robert thought irritably. He and Lisa used to do that when they were younger - taking sandwiches and a blanket, enjoying lunch by the river between their homes and then reading aloud to each other. It had all seemed innocent enjoyment then. It didn\u0027t with Findlay inserted in his place. \"Check your calendar then and tell me tonight when you will be free and I shall have my cook arrange a basket for us,\" Findlay suggested, opening the front door. \"I will,\" Lisa said, her expression becoming more solemn. For some reason that was more disturbing to Robert than her obvious pleasure had been. It sounded to him like a vow, as if she were agreeing to more than a simple picnic. He got the feeling Findlay had just taken the lead in her husband hunt . . . and the thought disturbed Robert more than he cared to admit. While she had so many men to choose from, he didn\u0027t really have to consider someone winning her heart, but now . . . He scowled at Findlay as the other man brushed a hand down Lisa\u0027s cheek in parting and then turned and started up the walk. Lisa watched him go briefly, then closed the door with a happy little sigh and immediately charged upstairs, clasping her books to her chest like treasure. Robert stood in the empty hall for a moment, a frown curving his lips. Lisa hadn\u0027t even glanced his way before rushing upstairs. It was as if she\u0027d forgotten he was even there. Which was what he wanted, he reminded himself firmly. She was supposed to move on. He had no desire to marry anyone. If he were interested in marrying, she would certainly be at the top of the list, but he just wasn\u0027t. The Langley men didn\u0027t do well in marriage, he reminded himself firmly. It was better she had her hat set on someone else. Robert just wished he was actually glad she had. \"Oh dear, maybe we should cancel and not attend the Kittriches\u0027 ball either.\" Lisa lifted her head from the basin she had been bent over for the last several hours and shook her head miserably. \"No. It\u0027s okay. You go ahead. Suzette and Daniel are expecting you. Besides there is nothing you can do for me here. I shall just - \" Hang over the basin tossing up my guts, she finished silently in her head as another round of heaving claimed her. Dear God, her sides ached horribly from the retching and there was nothing left to bring up but bile and still her stomach insisted on heaving. \"Oh dear,\" Christiana murmured again, rubbing her back sympathetically. \"And all you had to eat today was the pastries Lord Pembroke brought?\" Lisa nodded miserably and sagged as the latest round of heaving stopped. \"Did you not even break your fast?\" Christiana asked with a frown. Lisa shook her head. \"I was late rising today and only got below just before Pembroke arrived with his offering.\" She grimaced and admitted, \"I\u0027m afraid that made me gobble them up like a greedy child. I probably just had too many.\" \"Eating too many shouldn\u0027t make you this violently ill,\" Christiana muttered, rubbing her back again as Lisa once more began to retch. \"Oh Christiana, go,\" she said wearily as the latest round eased. \"Once my stomach settles enough to allow it, I am just going to lie down and rest.\" \"But I hate to leave you alone like this,\" Christiana protested unhappily. \"She won\u0027t be alone,\" Robert announced from the door. Lisa glanced to the side unhappily to see him crossing the room to join them where she knelt on the floor beside the bed, her head hanging over the water basin Bet had brought her. Part of Lisa flinched at his seeing her like this. Another part just felt too weak and poorly to care. \"I shall stay with her until she sleeps and then keep an ear out in case she is sick again,\" Robert assured Christiana, nudging her out of his way so that he could replace her in kneeling at Lisa\u0027s side. \"You go ahead. Richard is downstairs and the carriage is out front waiting. Go have fun. I shall take care of Lisa.\" \"Are you sure?\" Christiana asked uncertainly. \"Positive,\" Robert said firmly, beginning to rub Lisa\u0027s back as Christiana had been doing. It wasn\u0027t nearly as soothing when he did it however, Lisa noted as he said, \"Go ahead. I will send a message if she gets worse or doesn\u0027t improve.\" \"Very well then,\" Christiana said with a sigh. \"But do send word if she worsens, and try to get some liquids down her throat if you can. Well, once she seems capable of keeping them down,\" Christiana added dryly as Lisa began to heave again at the very suggestion. Despite her distraction, Lisa heard a heavy sigh from her sister and then her footsteps left the room and faded as she walked away up the hall. \"Go away,\" Lisa mumbled the moment she was sure Christiana was gone. \"No,\" Robert said simply, and held her forehead as she heaved again. Once her stomach eased in its violent rebellion, he asked, \"So Pembroke\u0027s pastries are the only thing you\u0027ve eaten?\" \"Heard that, did you?\" she asked irritably. \"Yes,\" he said, brushing her hair back from her cheeks and turning her face so he could look at her. Lisa just sighed. She knew she must look horrid, but was too exhausted and feeling too weak to care. However, whatever he saw made Robert frown and it was something to do with her eyes. She was too exhausted to even ask what it was. \"Was Pembroke going to the ball tonight?\" Robert asked quietly. Lisa frowned, but then shook her head. \"No. All the other men were asking me to save them a dance, but when I glanced to him to see if he wanted me to as well, he said he wished he would be there, but had a previous engagement.\" \"A previous engagement, huh?\" Robert asked grimly. \"Hmm,\" she said wearily and found herself leaning against his shoulder, her eyes closing. All she wanted to do was sleep, but she was afraid that shifting back into bed would bring on another bout of heaving and she was desperate to avoid that. Her stomach and ribs were already screaming in pain from the activity so far. \"Poor little Lisa,\" Robert murmured, running his hands over her hair gently. \"You feel like hell, don\u0027t you?\" She nodded, not bothering to open her eyes and felt him press a kiss to the top of her head, but couldn\u0027t even find the energy to be pleased at the affectionate gesture. Who cared anyway? It was an innocent caress, brotherly even, she supposed wearily as consciousness began to slip away. She stirred and murmured sleepily when he gathered her in his arms, but when she felt the soft bed beneath her, Lisa let herself drift off again. Sleep was definitely preferable to heaving anymore and she was desperate to avoid more heaving. Robert straightened from laying Lisa in bed. He pulled the covers over her and peered down at her silently. Even sick she was still lovely. The bruising around her eyes and the pallor of her skin didn\u0027t detract much from it. And while she was wearing a loose white sleeping gown that looked ages old and comfortable rather than actually attractive, it didn\u0027t hide the curves he\u0027d seen so clearly when she\u0027d been wearing that see-through creation Mrs. Morgan had put her in. \"Has her stomach finally settled?\" Robert glanced around at that whisper to find Bet crossing the room to his side to examine her mistress. He nodded in answer, and whispered back, \"Hopefully it\u0027s done and won\u0027t start up again.\" \"Aye,\" Bet agreed on a sigh. \"She\u0027s been miserable with it for hours. Started almost as soon as she got up here to the room.\" \"Right after the men left,\" Robert murmured. \"Yes, thank goodness,\" Bet whispered. \"She would have been doubly upset if it had started while they were here.\" \"Hmm,\" Robert murmured and turned to head for the door. \"I will be in Richard\u0027s office. Call me if she starts up again or anything else happens.\" \"Aye, my lord,\" Bet responded quietly, settling in the chair beside the bed to watch over her mistress. Robert left the door open so he would hear if Bet called. He started downstairs as he\u0027d intended, but then changed his mind and moved to his room instead. He had planned to go downstairs and read to pass the time, but he\u0027d been reading before bed last night and the book was on his bedside table. Once in the room, he decided it would be better if he read there and left his door open as well. He would be closer and could better hear if he was needed. Lisa stirred sleepily and turned on her back, her head rolling to the side and her gaze falling on the person slumped and asleep in a chair beside the bed. Bet. While there were no lit candles or oil lamps in the bedroom, the door was wide open and enough light was splashing in from the hall that she could see well enough to make out the woman\u0027s identity. A small smile curved Lisa\u0027s lips at the sight. Bet was the best maid a girl could ask for. Honestly. They had pretty much grown up together and were friends as much as anything else. A scratching sort of sound drew her attention toward the window, and Lisa peered sleepily that way to see a branch brushing against the pane. She started to glance away then, but the movement of the branch caught her attention. It was bobbing up and down against the window . . . which just seemed odd. It took her a moment to realize why. Surely a breeze would be moving it from side to side, not up and down? After the briefest hesitation, she sat up cautiously in bed. When her stomach didn\u0027t immediately begin to rebel, Lisa released a relieved breath and slid her feet to the floor, then stood up shakily. Her bout of vomiting might be over, but the aftereffects remained. Her stomach muscles were complaining something fierce at their abuse and she felt shaky and in need of liquid if not a full-course meal. Ignoring that for now, Lisa made her way carefully to the window to see what was causing the strange action. She was halfway there when the branch stopped moving. Curious and a little sleepy still, she paused at the window and looked out but the light from the hall was reflecting in the glass and she couldn\u0027t see anything. After a hesitation, she opened the windows, unlatching them and pushing one out to look about. A calm, breezeless night met her once the window was open and Lisa peered curiously at the tree outside her window, but it was now still. An owl or some other night creature must have been on the branch, she supposed, her eyes shifting upward to take in the night sky. It was starless tonight and dark as sin, she noted, breathing in the cool night air. It was only then she noted that the smell in the room was a little unpleasant. Deciding a little fresh air would be good, she left the window open and turned to move back to the bed, debating donning her robe and going below in search of food. While her stomach was no longer rebelling, it was gnawing with hunger. Not surprising, Lisa supposed, since it was completely empty. Grimacing at the memory of what had seemed like hours of retching - the cause of her empty stomach - Lisa paused at the bed and was reaching for the robe laid across the bottom of it when a soft shuffling sound from behind caught her ear. She stiffened and started to turn, and then managed a muffled gasp as she was grabbed from behind, something snaking around her waist and pulling her back hard against a strong hard body, even as a hand slapped across her mouth to stifle the small sound that escaped her. Before Lisa had even fully registered what was happening, she was kicking wildly as she was lifted off the ground and dragged backward across the room toward the window. It was good fortune that saved her in the end. Her captor moved too close to the table and chair where Lisa liked to sit to read and her wildly flailing feet caught the chair and sent it tumbling. The stubbing that her foot took made Lisa grunt into the hand over her mouth, but the sound was drowned out by the crash of the chair hitting the floor and then she saw Bet startle awake. Much to her relief, in the next moment, the maid was shrieking at the top of her lungs and on her feet, coming around the bed to try to help. Whether it was the oncoming Bet, or the fact that her screech surely hadn\u0027t gone unheard and help would most likely be on the way that put off her attacker, Lisa didn\u0027t know. But in the next moment she was released and crashing to her knees on the bedroom\u0027s hardwood floor. Bet halted in her forward charge to kneel beside her, her gaze sliding from Lisa to the man making his getaway as she asked, \"Are ye all right, Miss?\" \"Aye,\" Lisa gasped, glancing over her shoulder in time to see her attacker just pulling himself onto the window. \"What the hell?\" Robert\u0027s voice drew her head around as he crashed into the room. She opened her mouth to explain, but apparently he\u0027d spotted the man climbing out her window and was already charging forward. Lisa shifted to the side on her knees to get out of the way, but the fellow was already gone by the time Robert reached the window. That didn\u0027t stop him, however; quick as a whip he was following her attacker\u0027s path and climbing out of her window as well. \"Oh dear,\" Lisa muttered and struggled quickly to her feet with Bet\u0027s help. She staggered to the window then, wincing as her knees, shins and stomach muscles all complained of their distress and recent mistreatment. Ignoring that, she bent to rest on the ledge and leaned out to see what was happening. She was just in time to see her attacker drop from the tree and race from the yard. Robert was still a good distance from the ground when he allowed himself to drop from the branches to the grass below. He landed with a grunt and then gave chase, but Lisa could see the fellow had a good start on him. He was also moving like the devil himself was on his heels, while Robert had apparently injured himself and was limping somewhat. \"Lord Langley\u0027ll never catch him,\" Bet said with disappointment. \"Nay,\" Lisa agreed on a sigh and pulled the window closed once Robert left the yard and disappeared from sight. \"Shouldn\u0027t ye leave it open for Lord Langley to return?\" Bet asked with a frown. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll use the front door rather than climb back up the tree,\" Lisa pointed out. \"Oh, aye,\" Bet muttered and quickly drew the drapes shut over the window, then turned to follow as Lisa limped back to the bed to lay claim to her robe as she\u0027d intended before she was grabbed from behind. The maid\u0027s voice was worried as she asked, \"How are you feeling now?\" \"My stomach aches, my knees and shins hurt, and I am hungry,\" Lisa answered shakily, and then forced some strength into her voice and added, \"I would kill for a cup of tea.\" \"Do ye think it\u0027ll stay down?\" Bet asked with concern. \"Ye don\u0027t want to be heaving again.\" \"I think it will stay down now,\" Lisa said wearily as she drew the robe on and tied the sash. \"At least I hope it will because I could do with a cup to steady my nerves.\" \"Aye,\" Bet said with sympathy. \"Well you just sit yourself down and relax then. I shall fetch you up something.\" She urged her toward the toppled chair, and then rushed forward to straighten it for her to sit in. Lisa sat. Mostly because she was even shakier than she had been when she\u0027d first woken up. She also didn\u0027t protest when Bet settled a blanket across her knees and tucked it around her, but she released a rather relieved sigh when the maid stopped fussing and departed to find her a drink and a snack. Once she was alone, Lisa leaned back a little wearily, her eyes closing as she reviewed what had happened. She had no idea where her attacker had come from. She was pretty sure the tree had been empty when she\u0027d peered out, but then it was extremely dark and with all the leaves and shadow coating the branches, Lisa supposed he may have been hidden from view. And she\u0027d left the damned window open for him to come in after her, she thought with self-disgust. \"Lisa?\" Blinking her eyes open, she watched Robert enter with a lit candle and set it on the table by her bed before moving to stand before her. \"Are you all right?\" he asked with concern. \"Aye,\" Lisa assured him, sitting up a little straighter in her chair. \"Are you all right, Robert? You were limping as you gave chase.\" He grimaced with irritation, and admitted, \"I landed badly and twisted my ankle is all. Which slowed me enough to let him get away.\" \"Sit down,\" she suggested, waving to the bed. But rather than simply back up and settle on the edge of the bed as she\u0027d intended, he limped around it to retrieve the chair Bet had been sleeping in. He brought it back to set in front of hers. Sitting in it with a relieved little sigh, he ran one hand through his hair and then said, \"Tell me what happened.\" Lisa quickly explained about waking up, the bobbing branch and her investigation and then the attack. Once finished she sat back to await his next question. It wasn\u0027t long in coming. \"Did you see his face?\" \"He was wearing some sort of hood with holes cut out for the eyes, but I didn\u0027t even get a good look at his eyes. I\u0027m sorry,\" she murmured, but he shook his head. \"It\u0027s not your fault. He obviously had no desire to be recognized,\" he murmured, his gaze moving past her to the window, his expression thoughtful. \"You think it was my suitor,\" she said quietly. \"Someone I would recognize if I\u0027d seen his face.\" \"Or someone who works for him that you might have recognized as well,\" Robert said with a shrug. Lisa nodded, not arguing the point. \"I want you to stay away from Pembroke in the future,\" Robert said after a moment and she glanced up with surprise. \"Pembroke? Why him?\" she asked with surprise. He was second on her list of possible husbands, right behind Findlay. The man was handsome, thoughtful and trying very hard to try to please her by arranging the picnic and such. \"Because if it weren\u0027t for his pastries making you sick, you would have been at the ball tonight.\" \"It is hardly his fault if his cook\u0027s pastries made me ill,\" Lisa pointed out with amusement. \"It is if he added something to make you deliberately ill, Lisa,\" he said quietly and she blanched in dismay. \"You think he put something in the pastries to make me ill?\" \"All the other men were expecting you to be at the ball tonight,\" Robert pointed out. \"In fact, most of them are probably only realizing now that you aren\u0027t going to attend tonight. But whoever attacked or sent someone to attack you knew you would not be attending the ball before that.\" \"Oh, surely it is late enough that - \" \"It has been exactly one hour since I left you sleeping in here, Lisa,\" he said quietly. \"I doubt Christiana and Richard have been at the ball for more than a matter of minutes. If they have even made it through the lineup of disembarking carriages to the door yet.\" \"Oh,\" Lisa murmured, recognizing the truth of his words. Getting into the more popular balls could be rather tedious. The narrow streets were always crowded and the carriage traffic slow on the way there, and then the lineup of disembarking carriages was always long. That was then followed by the long lineup at the actual ballroom entrance as guests waited to be announced. It could take a while to get in. Leaving was never quite as bad, but it was something of a trial as well if you waited until everyone else was leaving to head home. \"Just stay away from him for now,\" Robert repeated and this time she nodded, though a bit reluctantly. Really, Pembroke seemed very kind. Besides, she had rather been looking forward to the ride up the river and the picnic that was to follow the day after tomorrow. Well, she was now that she wasn\u0027t hanging over a basin. Although, now that she thought of it, if his cook was preparing the picnic, perhaps it was better to avoid it anyway. She didn\u0027t wish to be hanging over the basin again the night after tomorrow. \"Here we are,\" Bet said cheerfully, entering the room now with a tray in hand. \"I brought ye tea and some food too, Lord Langley. I thought ye might want it after yer efforts.\" \"Thank you, Bet.\" Robert stood at once and moved the table beside Lisa\u0027s chair, shifting it between them for Bet to set the tray on. \"That was kind of you.\" \"My pleasure, my lord,\" Bet said, blushing slightly at the compliment as she set the tray between them. She straightened, hesitated, and then headed for the door saying, \"Cook asked for my help with mending her apron so I\u0027ll just go see what I can do while you eat. Send for me if you need me.\" \"Thank you, Bet,\" Lisa murmured as the maid left. She then turned her attention to the contents of the tray. Cold chicken, cucumber sandwiches and bumbleberry tarts filled two plates on the tray. There was also a steaming pot of tea and two cups. Lisa smiled with anticipation and pulled the nearer plate a bit closer to begin on the chicken, but paused with a drumstick to her lips, eyes widening when Robert did the honors and began to pour the tea. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said, setting the chicken leg back. \"I\u0027ll do that.\" It was always the woman\u0027s place to pour the tea, but Robert just chuckled and shook his head. \"No. Go ahead. You are obviously hungry. I will pour the tea.\" \"Thank you,\" Lisa murmured, picking up her drumstick again and this time taking a bite. A little sigh of pleasure slid from her lips as the flavor of roast chicken filled her mouth. It was heavenly, even cold. But then she was hungry enough that she suspected even porridge would have tasted delicious at that point, and she disliked porridge. \"Slow down,\" Robert cautioned as she swallowed and immediately took a second bite. \"Your stomach may still be a little tender. You don\u0027t want to make yourself sick again.\" \"No, I don\u0027t,\" Lisa agreed dryly, forcing herself to set the drumstick down and instead pick up the tea he\u0027d just poured for her. They were silent for a bit after that, both of them eating and enjoying the tea. It was only after they\u0027d both pushed their plates away that Lisa glanced to him and said quietly, \"Thank you, Robert.\" \"For what?\" he asked with surprise. \"I didn\u0027t bring the food. Bet did.\" She smiled faintly at his confusion and explained, \"Not for that. For . . . well, everything else,\" she said wryly. \"For coming for me at Mrs. Morgan\u0027s. For looking out for me since then and for chasing after that man tonight. I know I have given you a hard time, but I do appreciate it. I guess my pride was just hurting a bit after that business in the carriage. But you were right,\" she rushed on when he would have interrupted. \"While I had a crush on you while growing up, we have been too close for too long ever to turn our relationship into anything more than one resembling siblings. Now, I can\u0027t even imagine you kissing me or caressing my cheek the way Charlie did the other night. The very idea is laughable.\" Standing up, Lisa moved around the table to bend and kiss his cheek, then straightened and moved to the bed, undoing and removing her robe as she went. \"Good night, Robert,\" she finished around a yawn. \"I hope you sleep well. I certainly shall, knowing you are here, just a shout away, to watch over me.\" She then slid into bed, pulled the covers up to her chin, and closed her eyes. Robert stared at the bed for several minutes, her words replaying themselves in his head. She couldn\u0027t even imagine him kissing or caressing her as Findlay had? Well, he bloody well could. And he\u0027d have done a damned sight better job than the tepid efforts he\u0027d witnessed from Findlay at the ball the night before, he thought. But it was a fleeting thought. His mind was full of the image of the way her robe and gown had gaped as she\u0027d bent to kiss his cheek. He\u0027d seen damned near all the way down to her belly button as she\u0027d done it, though he was sure she had no clue of the view he\u0027d had. And then when she\u0027d tugged off her robe to crawl into bed, the neckline had dropped off on one side, revealing a good expanse of one creamy shoulder. Now she was lying there, not more than a few feet away, naked but for a thin nightgown, completely unconcerned that a red-blooded male was still sitting there. And he was red-blooded. That blood was pulsing through his body hot and strong right then. But did Lisa care? Hell no. It seemed she\u0027d decided he was right and she was better off with one of those addlepated idiots who had been fawning over her the last few days. Damn. She was going to be the death of him if he didn\u0027t get this business resolved soon and get away from her, he thought grimly and stood to quickly gather the tray and carry it from the room. \"Good night, Robert,\" Lisa murmured as he reached the door and it was the sexiest damned sound he\u0027d ever heard: soft and sleepy, almost a whisper. He could imagine her saying his name just that way, but in sleepy greeting as he slid into bed next to her, his naked body sliding against hers. She was definitely going to be the death of him, Robert decided. He didn\u0027t respond to her words, but simply headed silently up the hall, his expression unhappy.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-husband-hunt-madison-sisters-3/page-8.html","bookId":2649,"book":{"id":2649,"title":"The Husband Hunt (Madison Sisters #3)","description":"Storyline: The Husband Hunt (Madison Sisters #3) Let the hunt begin… Lisa Madison wants a husband, and she has just the candidate in mind: Robert Langley. Trouble is, the infuriating man insists on seeing her as the impish girl she once was—even as every other gentleman in London has taken notice of her womanly…charms. When her beauty lands her in danger, it’s Robert who comes to the rescue…only to announce his affections are not of the romantic variety! Robert saw enough sorrow in his parents’ union to know he wants nothing to do with marriage, which is exactly what he’ll be trapped into if he acts on his desire for the irksome siren. And then Lisa does what Robert least expects: gives up on him! As feigned indifference gives way, blistering passion burns at last. But just before the pair can give in to hard-won bliss, an enemy with unfinished business lurks threatening to destroy them both.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-husband-hunt-madison-sisters-3.jpg","author":"Lynsay Sands","type":"Historical","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-husband-hunt-madison-sisters-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:25 AM"}}
