{"id":26197,"no":6,"title":"JONAH AND THE WHALE.","content":"BIBLE ROMANCES.—6. By G. W. FOOTE. We have often wondered whether Shakespeare had the story of Jonah in his mind when he wrote that brief dialogue between Hamlet and Polonius, which immediately precedes the famous closet-scene in the Master\u0027s greatest play— Hamlet.—Do you see yonder cloud that\u0027s almost in shape of a camel? Polonius.—By the mass, and \u0027tis like a camel, indeed. Hamlet.—Methinks it is like a weasel. Polonius.—It is backed like a weasel. Hamlet.—Or like a whale? Polonius.—Very like a whale. Having, however, no means whereby to decide this question, we must content ourselves with broaching it, and leave the reader to form his own conclusion. Yet we cannot refrain from expressing our opinion that the story of the strange adventures of the prophet Jonah is \"very like a whale.\" In another of Shakespeare\u0027s plays, namely \"The Tempest,\" we find a phrase which exactly applies to the romance of Jonah. When Trinculo discovers Caliban lying on the ground, he proceeds to investigate the monster. \"What,\" quoth he, \"have we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell.\" Now that is a most admirable description of the Book of Jonah. It has \"a very ancient and fish-like smell.\" In fact, it is about the fishiest of all the fishy stories ever told. Sailors\u0027 \"yarns\" have become proverbial for their audacious and delicious disregard of truth, and the Book of Jonah is \"briny\" from beginning to end. It contains only forty-eight verses, but its brevity is no defect. On the contrary, that is one of its greatest charms. The mind takes in the whole story at once, and enjoys it undiluted; as it were a goblet of the fine generous wine of romance. Varying the expression, the Book of Jonah may be called the perfect cameo of Bible fiction. When the Book of Jonah was written no one precisely knows, nor is it discoverable who wrote it. According to Matthew Arnold some unknown man of genius gave to Christendom the fourth gospel, and with sublime self-abnegation allowed his name to perish. A similar remark must be made concerning the unknown author who gave to the world this racy story of Jonah and the whale. We heartily wish his name had been preserved for remembrance and praise. Our marginal Bibles date the Book of Jonah b.c. cir. 862. Other authorities give, the more recent date of b.c. 880 as that of the events recorded in it. This chronology will suggest an important reflection later on. The wonderful story of Jonah and the whale begins in this wise:—\"Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah, the son of Amittai, saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.\" Who Amittai was, and whether man or woman, is a problem still unsolved; but it is reasonable to suppose the name was that of Jonah\u0027s father, as the ancient Jews paid no superfluous attentions to women, and generally traced descent from the paternal stem alone. Amittai belonged to a place called Gathhepher, \"the village of the Cow\u0027s tail,\" or, as otherwise interpreted, \"the Heifer\u0027s trough.\" Jonah\u0027s tomb is said to have been long shown on a rocky hill near the town; but whether the old gentleman was ever buried there no man can say. According to Mr. Bradlaugh, the word Jonah means a dove, and is by some derived from an Arabic root, signifying to be weak or gentle. Another interpretation, by Gesenius, is a feeble, gentle bird. This refractory prophet was singularly ill-named. If his cognomen was bestowed on him by his parents, they must have been greatly deceived as to his character. The proverb says that it is a wise son that knows his own father; and with the history of Jonah before us, we may add that it is a wise father who rightly knows his own son. The solicitude of \"the Lord God of the Hebrews\" for the welfare of the Ninevites is to the sceptical mind an extraordinary phenomenon. It is one of the very few cases in which he shows the slightest concern for any other people than the Jews. His ordinary practice was to slaughter them wholesale by pestilence or the sword; and it is therefore very refreshing to meet with such an instance of his merciful care. For once he remembers that the rest of Adam\u0027s posterity are his children, and possess a claim on his attention. Jonah, however, did not share this benign sentiment; and disrelishing the missionary enterprise assigned him, he \"rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.\" Jehovah does not seem to have been omnipresent then; that attribute attaches to him only since the beginning of the Christian era, when he assumed universal sway. Long before the time of Jonah, another man, the first ever born in this world, namely Cain, also \"went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod;\" probably so called because the Lord was not quite awake in that locality. No one knows were Nod was situated, nor can the most learned archaeologists denote the actual position of Tarshish. These two places would be well worth study. A careful examination of them would to some extent reveal what went on in those parts of the world to which God\u0027s presence did not extend; and we should be able to compare their geological and other records with those of the rest of the world. No doubt some striking differences would be perceptible. Jonah determined to voyage by the Joppa and Tarshish line. So he went to the former port and embarked in one of the Company\u0027s ships, after paying his fare like a man. Having a perfectly untroubled conscience, and no apprehension of his coming troubles, Jonah no doubt felt highly elated at having done the Lord so neatly. Perhaps it was this elation of spirits which safe-guarded him from sea-sickness. At any rate he went \"down into the sides of the ship,\" and there slept the sleep of the just. So profound was his slumber, that it was \"quite unbroken\" by the horrible tempest that ensued. The Lord had his eye on Jonah, for the prophet had not yet reached the safe refuge of Tarshish; and he \"sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was likely to be broken.\" The mariners \"cast forth the wares that were in the ship\" to lighten her, and toiled hard to keep afloat; but their efforts were apparently fruitless, and nothing lay before them but the certain prospect of a watery grave. The reader will be able to imagine the tumult of the scene; the dash of ravening waves, the fierce howling of the wind, the creaking of masts and the straining of cordage, the rolling and pitching of the good ship and the shifting of her cargo, the captain\u0027s hoarse shouts of command and the sailors\u0027 loud replies, alternated with frenzied appeals to their gods for help. Yet amidst all the uproar Jonah still slept, as though the vessel were gaily skimming the waters before a pleasant breeze. Let us pause here to interpose a question. Did the \"great wind sent out into the sea\" by the Lord confine its attentions to the immediate vicinity of Jonah\u0027s ship, or did it cause a general tempest and perhaps send some other vessels to Davy Jones\u0027s locker? As no restrictions are mentioned, we presume that the tempest was general, and that the Lord\u0027s wind, like the Lord\u0027s rain referred to by Jesus, fell alike upon the just and the unjust. This circumstance very naturally heightens our previous conception of his righteousness. That the Lord, or some other supernatural power, caused the tempest, the mariners of Jonah\u0027s ship and their captain never once doubted. Living as they did, and as we do not, under a miraculous dispensation, they attributed every unusual, and especially every unpleasant, occurrence to the agency of a god. The idea of predicting storms, with which the civilised world is now familiar, they would doubtless have regarded as blasphemous and absurd. It is, therefore, by no means wonderful that every man on board (except Jonah, who was fast asleep) \"called unto his god.\" Ignorant of what god was afflicting them, they appealed impartially all round, in the hope of hitting the right one. But the circle of their deities did not include the one which sent the wind; so the tempest continued to prevail, despite their prayers. In this extremity a happy thought occurred to the \"ship-master.\" It struck him that the strange passenger down below might know something about the tempest, and that his god might have caused it. Forthwith there dawned within him a recollection of words which Jonah had uttered on embarking. Had he not told them \"that he fled from the presence of the Lord?\" \"Dear me,\" the captain probably said to himself, \"what a fool I was not to think of this before. That chap down below is the occasion of all these troubles; I\u0027ll go and hunt him up, confound him!\" Thereupon he doubtless slapped his thigh, as is the wont of sailors when they solve a difficulty or hit on a brilliant idea; after which he descended \"into the sides of the ship,\" whither Jonah had gone. There he found the prophet slumbering as peacefully as a weanling child, with a smile of satisfaction playing over his Hebrew features. We can imagine the captain\u0027s profound disgust in presence of this scene. He and his men had been toiling and praying, and, alas! pitching the cargo overboard, in order to save their skins; and all the while the occasion of their trouble had been lying fast asleep! Preserving an outward decorum, however, he accosted Jonah in very mild terms. \"What meanest thou, O sleeper?\" said he, \"Arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.\" What exquisite simplicity! It reminds us of the childlike and bland Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, when he opposed Mr. Brad-laugh\u0027s entry to the House of Commons. That honorable champion of Almighty God objected to Mr. Bradlaugh on the ground that he acknowledged no God, and was thus vastly different from the other members of the House, all of whom \"believed in some kind of deity or other.\" You must have a god to be a legislator, it seems, even if that god is, as the Americans say, only a little tin Jesus. So the captain of this tempest-tost ship desired Jonah to call upon his god. He made no inquiry into the character of the god, any more than did Sir Henry Drummond Wolff on a later occasion. It was enough to know that Jonah had \"some kind of deity or other.\" Any god would do. Now comes the most remarkable episode in this wonderful story. The captain and the crew were aware that Jonah had \"fled from the presence of the Lord,\" because he had told them; they had, therefore, every reason to believe that Jonah\u0027s god had caused the tempest. Yet, curiously enough, instead of at once proceeding on this belief, they said, everyone to his fellow, \"Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.\" This wholly superfluous procedure may, perhaps, be attributed to their exceptional love of justice. They wished to make assurance doubly sure before they \"went for\" Jonah. And with sweet simplicity they had recourse to the casting of lots, in which their wills would be inoperative, and the whole responsibility of deciding be thrown on the gods, who alone possessed the requisite information. The lot of course fell upon Jonah. Any other result would have spoiled the story. \"Then,\" continues our narrative, \"said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us? What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them. Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought and was tempestuous. And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.\" We are almost dumb with astonishment before this act of self-sacrifice on the part of Jonah, for which his previous history left us quite unprepared. Who would have thought him capable of such disinterested conduct? His self-abnegation was assuredly heroic, and may even be called sublime. No doubt the captain and crew of the ship were as much astonished as we are, and their opinion of Jonah went up several hundred per cent. They resolved to make a last supreme effort before turning him into a fish-bait. But all their gallant endeavors were discovered to be futile and a mere waste of time. So the men, more in sorrow than in anger, finally took Jonah up and threw him overboard. They had done their best for him, and now, finding that they could do no more except at too great a risk, they sadly left him to do the rest for himself. Immediately, we are told, \"the sea ceased from her raging.\" Jonah was oil upon the troubled waters. What an invaluable recipe does this furnish us against the dangers of the deep sea! The surest method of allaying a storm is to throw a prophet overboard. Every ship should carry a missionary in case of need. It would, indeed, be well if the law made this compulsory. The cost of maintaining the missionary would be more than covered by the saving effected in insurance. Here is a splendid field for Christian self-sacrifice! Hundreds of gentlemen who are now engaged in very doubtful labor among the heathen, might engage in this new enterprise with the absolute certainty of a beneficent result; for poor ungodly mariners would thus be spared a hasty dispatch from this world without time to repent and obtain forgiveness, and be allowed ample leisure to secure salvation. When the men saw that \"the sea ceased from her raging\" on Jonah\u0027s being cast into her depths, \"they feared the Lord exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord, and made vows.\" To the sceptical mind it would seem that they had much more reason to \"fear\" the Lord during the continuance of the tempest than after it had subsided. It also seems strange that they should have the means wherewith to offer a sacrifice. Perhaps they had a billy-goat on board, and made him do duty, in default of anything better. Or failing even a billy-goat, as the Lord God of the Hebrews could only be propitiated by the shedding of blood, they perhaps caught and immolated a stray rat. The nature of their \"vows\" is not recorded, but it is not unreasonable to assume that they swore never again to take on board a passenger fleeing \"from the presence of the Lord.\" Meanwhile, what had become of poor Jonah? Most men would be effectually settled if thrown overboard in a storm. But there are some people who were not born to be drowned, and Jonah was one of them. He was destined to another fate. The Lord, it appears, \"had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah,\" and the feat was of course duly performed. Our narrative does not describe the character of this \"great fish,\" but light is cast on the subject by another passage of Scripture. In the twelfth chapter of St. Matthew, and the fortieth verse, Jesus is represented as saying, \"For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale\u0027s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\" The great fish was then a whale. Jesus said so, and there can be no higher authority. Sharks and such ravenous fish have an unpleasant habit of \"chawing\" their victims pretty considerably before swallowing them; so, on the whole, we prefer to believe that it was a whale. Yet the Levant is a curious place for a whale to be lurking in. The creature must have been miraculously led there to go through its appointed performance. It must also have been \"prepared,\" to use the language of the Bible, in a very remarkable way, for the gullet of a whale is not large enough to allow of the passage of an object exceeding the size of an ordinary herring. Swallowing Jonah must have been a tough job after the utmost preparation. With a frightfully distended throat, however, the whale did its best, and by dint of hard striving at last got Jonah down. Having properly taken Jonah in out of the wet, the poor whale doubtless surmised that its troubles had ended. But alas they had only just begun! Swallowing a prophet is one thing; digesting him is another. For three days and three nights the whale struggled desperately to digest Jonah, and for three days and nights Jonah obstinately refused to be digested. Never in the entire course of its life had it experienced such a difficulty. During the whole of that period, too, Jonah carried on a kind of prayer meeting, and the strange rumbling in its belly must have greatly added to the poor animal\u0027s discomfort At last it grew heartily sick of Jonah, and vomited him up on dry land. We have no doubt that it swam away into deep waters, a sadder but wiser whale; and that ever afterwards, instead of bolting its food, it narrowly scrutinised every morsel before swallowing it, to make sure it wasn\u0027t another prophet. According to its experience, prophets were decidedly the most unprofitable articles of consumption. We are of course aware that the narrative states that \"the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited Jonah upon the dry land.\" But this we conceive to be a mere pleasantry on the part of the unknown author. The idea of the Lord whispering into a whale\u0027s ear is ineffably ludicrous: besides, the whale had a very natural inclination to rid itself of Jonah, and needed no divine prompting. Jonah\u0027s prayer \"unto the Lord his God out of the fish\u0027s belly\" is very amusing. There is not a sentence in it which bears any reference to the prophet\u0027s circumstances. It is a kind of Psalm, after the manner of those ascribed to David. Our belief is that the author found it floating about, and thinking it would do for Jonah, inserted it in his narrative, without even taking the trouble to furbish it into decent keeping with the situation. The word of the Lord came unto Jonah a second time, and presuming no more to disobey, he went to Nineveh. It is to be supposed, however, that he first well-lined his poor stomach, for both he and the whale had fasted for three days and nights, and must have been sadly in want of victuals. Nineveh, according to our author, was a stupendous city of \"three days\u0027 journey.\" This means its diameter and not its circumference, for we are told that Jonah \"entered into the city a day\u0027s journey.\" If we allow twenty miles as a moderate days\u0027 walk, Nineveh was sixty miles through from wall to wall, or about twenty times as large as London; and if densely populated like our metropolis, it must have contained more than eighty million inhabitants. This is too great a stretch even for a sailor\u0027s yarn. Our author did not take pains to clear his narrative of discrepancy. In his last verse he informs us that the city contained \"more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left.\" If this number is correct Nineveh was a large place, but its dimensions were very much less than those stated in the Book of Jonah. Jonah obeyed the Lord this time and began to preach. \"Yet forty days,\" cried he, \"and Nineveh shall be overthrown.\" How the prophet made himself understood is an open question! Either the Lord taught him their language, or he miraculously enabled them to understand Hebrew. Further, they worshipped Baal, and Jonah preached to them in the name of his foreign God. According to ancient, and to a large extent modern custom, we should expect them in such a case to kill the presumptuous prophet, or at least to shut him up as a madman. Yet they did nothing of the kind. On the contrary, \"the people of Nineveh believed God.\" Even the king was converted. He covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. He also decreed that neither man nor beast in the city should eat or drink anything; but, said he, \"let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way.\" What an enormous consumption of sackcloth there must have been! The merchants who sold it did a surprising business, and no doubt quotations went up immensely. We wonder, indeed, how they managed to supply such a sudden and universal demand. And what a sight was presented by the whole population of the city! Men, women, and children, high and low, rich and poor, were all arrayed in the same dingy garments. Even the horses, cows, pigs and sheep, were similarly attired. What a queer figure they must have cut! And what an astonishing chorus of prayer ascended to heaven! According to the text, the beasts had to \"cry mightily\" as well as the men. Since the confusion of tongues at Babel, neither history nor tradition records such a frightful hubbub. Their supplications prevailed. God \"saw their works, that they had turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not.\" Immutable God changes his mind, infallible God repents! God spared Nineveh, but only for a brief while, for it was destroyed a few years later by Arbaces, the Mede. The merciful respite was thus not of long continuance. Yet it \"displeased Jonah exceedingly.\" He had been suspicious from the first, and he only fulfilled God\u0027s mission under constraint. And now his worst suspicions were confirmed. After he had told the Ninevites that their city would be overthrown in forty days, God had relented, and utterly ruined Jonah\u0027s reputation as a prophet. So he made himself a booth outside the city, and sat in its shadow, to watch what would happen, with a deep feeling, which he plainly expressed to the Almighty, that now his reputation was gone he might as well die. The Lord considerately \"prepared a gourd,\" which grew up over Jonah\u0027s head to protect him from the heat; at which the sulky prophet was \"exceedingly glad,\" although it would naturally be thought that the booth would afford ample protection. He, however, soon found himself sold; for the Lord prepared a worm to destroy the gourd, and when the sun arose he sent \"a vehement east wind\" which beat upon poor Jonah\u0027s head, and made him so faint that he once more asked God to despatch him out of his misery. Whereupon the Lord said coaxingly, \"Doest thou well to be angry?\" And Jonah pettishly answered, \"Yes, I do.\" Then the Lord, with a wonderful access of pathos, altogether foreign to his general character, twitted Jonah with having pity for the gourd and none for the inhabitants of \"that great city.\" With this the story concludes. We are unable to say whether the poor prophet, so wretchedly sold, ever recovered from his spleen, or whether it shortened his days and brought him to an untimely grave. The Book of Jonah is as true as Gospel, for Jesus endorsed it. The Bible contains the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. So without expressing any sceptical sentiments, we will end by repeating Byron\u0027s words, \"Truth is strange—stranger than fiction.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3219/87799.html","bookId":707,"book":{"id":707,"title":"Bible Romances","description":"简介： The Book of Genesis is generally thought, as Professor Huxley says, to contain the beginning and the end of sound science.
