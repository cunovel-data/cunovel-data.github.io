{"id":42057,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V THE GREAT NUGGET, AND HOW UNCLE WILL HEARD OF IT","content":"\"Let me see, Charles,\" he began; \"I was at Rainy Hollow when I wrote to you, wasn\u0027t I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Bradford. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I told you of the rumors of rich strikes about two hundred miles in on this trail?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, my intention was to go straight to that spot with all possible speed; but as Robbie Burns puts it, \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The best-laid schemes o\u0027 mice an\u0027 men \\n\\n Gang aft a-gley.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n I met with an accident, and it\u0027s fortunate that I did, for when I reached this place yesterday I found that the stories of gold had leaked out, and already a well equipped party of more than thirty men had just landed here. To be exact, there are thirty-six of them; and owing to the absolute secrecy which they maintain regarding their destination, they are already known as the Mysterious Thirty-six. I have tried to induce two or three of them to talk, but they declared they knew no more about their plans than I did. Only their leader[39] knows where they are going, and what they are to do. Now, I am perfectly convinced that these men are bound for the very spot I wrote you about, and we must get ahead of them, if we are to have the pick of the claims. They are camped now about three miles up the valley, waiting for a party of Indians who are to help them with their sleds. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s fortunate I had to return to the coast, for you might not have realized the necessity of outstripping them. Besides that, I have cached most of my goods a hundred and forty miles up the trail, and come back empty-handed, so for that distance Long Peter and I can help you with your outfit, and we can give them a good race.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Won\u0027t that be fun?\" cried Roly, excitedly. \"I should just like to give them the slip!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n David had a better idea of what it meant. \"You won\u0027t feel so much like racing, I guess,\" said he, \"after a few miles of it. But, Uncle,\" he added, \"did you say you had cashed your goods? You haven\u0027t sold out, have you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no!\" answered Uncle Will. \"The word I used was \u0027cached,\u0027 which, in the language of the trail, signifies that I left my goods temporarily beside the way. A \u0027cache,\u0027 if we consider the French word \u0027cacher,\u0027 would mean goods concealed or covered up; but the idea of concealment is not prominent in the miner\u0027s use of[40] the term, and in fact there is generally no attempt at concealment. It would be death in this country to be convicted of stealing such supplies, and few Indians or whites would venture to disturb them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I understand now,\" said David, \"and beg pardon for interrupting. And now what was the accident you mentioned?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Uncle Will took a few strong puffs on his pipe, and blew the smoke away in rings meditatively. Presently he proceeded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I won\u0027t stop to tell you much about my journey, for you will soon pass over the same ground. Rainy Hollow, where I wrote the letter, is about sixty miles from here, near the summit of Chilkat Pass. I pushed on from that point through a grand mountainous country. Day after day I trudged through snowy valleys and over frozen rivers until I reached Dalton\u0027s trading-post, the location of which, about a hundred and twenty miles from the coast, you have doubtless noticed on the maps. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There I rested a day, and fell into conversation with a young German, Al King by name, who told me he had spent all of last summer in prospecting on the coast, and had recently explored the region around Dalton\u0027s. He had taken a claim on a stream called Shorty Creek, about thirty miles away and somewhat to the west of the main trail, and thought a man could make about ten dollars a day there, working alone; but I have no doubt,[41] from what he told me of the character of the gulch, that operations on a larger scale would pay extremely well, and I resolved to turn aside for a look at the place on my way north. I convinced myself that he had heard nothing of the rumors which had brought me into the region, and had not visited the spot to which I was going, and I thought it best to tell him nothing then, though I hope, if all goes well, to do him a good turn later. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"After leaving Dalton\u0027s Post, we—that is, Long Peter and I—continued as far as Klukshu Lake, the point at which we were to turn from the main trail and make a flying trip over to Shorty Creek, which was about fifteen miles distant by the winter route, I should judge. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We were cooking our supper among the willows near the foot of the lake when we heard the sound of a gun toward the north, followed by a cry. We both jumped up and ran to the shore, in order to get a clear view up the lake. Half a mile away near the east bank we could see what was apparently a man lying on the ice, with a smaller person bending over him, while a dog was running and barking around the two. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On reaching the place, we found that the prostrate man was a young Indian of the Stik tribe, whose village lies near Dalton\u0027s Post. His younger brother, a lad of about fourteen, was with him. Long Peter recognized them both. \\n\\n \\n\\n [42] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We saw at once that Lucky, the older one, had been shot. As we afterward learned, he had left his shot-gun standing against a log on the shore while he went out on the ice to fish. While he was cutting a hole, the dog upset the gun and discharged it, and poor unlucky Lucky had received most of the shot below the left knee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His small brother, who was called Coffee Jack, was trying to stanch the flow of blood when we came up, and Lucky was quite coolly giving directions. I bound a handkerchief tightly about the wound, and we helped the unfortunate fellow to our camp, where we made him as comfortable as possible. On the following day, I succeeded in picking most of the shot out of his leg,—an operation which he bore with true Indian fortitude. Then came the question of what to do with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Long Peter was for leaving him right there in care of Coffee Jack. You see, there\u0027s not much love lost between the Chilkats and the Stiks. The two tribes used to be continually at war, for the Chilkats wouldn\u0027t let the Stiks come out to the coast without a fight. And though the presence of the whites prevents actual war at present, the members of the rival tribes have very little to say to each other, remembering the old feud. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was quite unwilling, however, to leave Lucky until I had assured myself that his wound was healing properly, so we remained there with him a week. At the end of that time, as all went well, I made preparations to continue[43] on the journey, intending to leave provisions enough to last the two brothers until they could return to their village, for they had with them, at the time of the accident, a very small supply of dried salmon, and that was already consumed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are two log shanties near the foot of Klukshu Lake. One was in good repair, and the door was fastened with a padlock. I suppose some white man—Dalton, perhaps—keeps supplies there. The other was open to any one who cared to enter, and though the roof was gone, the hut afforded fairly good shelter. Into this hut we carried Lucky, after repairing the roof as well as we could, and cutting some firewood, for it was intensely cold. With a good fire blazing in the centre of the room and Coffee Jack at hand, there was no fear that Lucky would suffer with cold, even though the mercury froze in the tube, as in fact it did a little later in my pocket thermometer when I hung it on my tent-pole one night. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When all was ready, and Long Peter and I had packed our goods on our sleds, I went into the hut to say good-by to the brothers. Lucky beckoned me to come closer. When I had done so, Coffee Jack shut the door behind me. I thought from their actions that they had something to say, and didn\u0027t wish Long Peter to hear it, which proved to be the case. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Having made sure that Peter was at a distance, Lucky[44] said in a low tone, \u0027You good man. You help me. You give me muck-muck. Now me help you. Me find big nug—what you call \u0027em—nuggit—Kah Sha River—big as my head—four moons. Me show you when snow go away—no find him now.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Here Roly interrupted to ask if Lucky\u0027s head was as big as four moons. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no!\" replied Uncle Will, smiling. \"He meant that it was four months ago when he found the big nugget. The only month the Indians know is the period between one full moon and another, which is about thirty days. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"After some further conversation with Lucky,\" continued Uncle Will, \"I made out that he had discovered, not a loose nugget, but what I judge is a remarkable outcropping of gold ore in the solid rock. He had no means of breaking out any of the rock, and so had nothing by which to prove his statements, but I have every reason to believe him. Now the Kah Sha River is the stream into which Shorty Creek flows, so the discovery must be in the neighborhood of King\u0027s claim. Lucky said that the snow was very deep in the gorge where the nugget is, and it would be hidden for two moons. He promised to meet me at the proper season, and go with me to the spot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Long Peter and I then started on our journey; but we had gone only a short distance toward the lake when,[45] in descending a steep bank, all the upright supports on one side of my sled gave way, some of them being split beyond repair, and the iron braces broken. The uprights on the other side were badly wrenched and weakened at the same time, and further progress that day was out of the question. We therefore took everything back to the hut, and cached the goods there. I found it impossible to repair the sled. It was an old one which I never ought to have bought, but I was in a hurry when I started into the country, and took the first one I saw. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There was nothing to do but return for a strong sled. I could get none at the trading-post, and so came all the way back, and the more readily, because I knew it was time you reached here if you were coming. Long Peter\u0027s sled we brought with us, and now I must go over to Dyea or Skagway and get one for myself. Then we shall be in first-rate trim.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, boys,\" said Mr. Bradford, as Uncle Will finished, \"it looks as if we had work ahead, and plenty of it. Better turn in now and get all the sleep you can.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys accordingly rose and departed toward their tent. David crawled into that small dwelling first, and Roly handed him a rubber blanket, which he doubled and laid on the canvas floor. Then a down quilt was similarly folded and placed upon the rubber blanket.[46] The heavy woolen blankets followed, and finally the other quilt. Into this warm nest the boys crept, after removing their shoes and coats and rolling the latter into the form of a pillow. Two minutes later they were sound asleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48525.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
