{"id":42088,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVI","content":"HOW DAVID MET THE OFFENDER AND WAS PREVENTED FROM SPEAKING HIS MIND \n \n Having satisfied himself that the owner of the cache was not about, David threw off his pack, and sat down upon it with his back against the log wall to consider what he would do; and the more he thought about it, the more his anger rose. \n \n It was the custom on the trail to cache provisions anywhere. Both Indians and white men respected the unwritten law which held the theft of food in such a region to be worthy of death. No one but a starving man or a desperado would violate that law, and there were few such. Indeed, David had never seen any indication that this chance of loss was being reckoned with. But here was a man who apparently distrusted all his fellow-men,—who suspected every traveller on the trail,—who not only confiscated a cabin for the storage of his goods, but took contemptible measures to protect his property. David felt instinctively that he had to deal with as mean, sour, and selfish a person as it had ever been his lot to meet, and had not the slightest doubt that the character of the master, as is often the case, could be accurately[298] surmised from the temper of his dog. The latter still growled and barked viciously at every sound. \n \n At last he rose and went to the rear of the cabin, thinking to enter by way of the fireplace. He knew he could easily loosen and remove two or three of the stakes which had surrounded the stove, and once inside the cabin, he could sleep in his own bunk, which was situated diagonally opposite the corner where the dog was chained. But no sooner had he begun to carry out this plan than the savage animal became furious, and it was perfectly evident that he would have no rest in the company of such a brute. \n \n \"If I only had my rifle,\" he groaned. \n \n It is entirely safe to say that with it he would have made an end of the animal without a moment\u0027s hesitation, flung its body into the creek, and taken possession of the cabin, which his own hands had helped to build. To be sure, he might kill the dog with the hatchet, but such butchery was repugnant to him, and he quickly dismissed the idea. On the whole, it would be best, he decided, to spend the night under the open sky, where there would be no distractions other than the wind in the trees and the continual singing of the mosquitoes. So he picked up his pack, trudged off into the grove of spruces to the south, and selected a dry, level, sandy spot near the edge of the bluff which fronted the river. Here he ate a frugal supper, then spread his blankets on the[299] ground, and so passed the night, though the assiduous musical insects which swarmed upon his head-net robbed him of nearly all sleep. After an early breakfast, he resumed his march, fully resolved, in the event of their meeting, to tell the owner of the cache exactly what he thought of him. \n \n This part of the trail was familiar, and he walked briskly, only pausing at the foot of the first small lake to catch two or three grayling, with which to eke out his scanty rations. These he roasted before a fire at noon, and, rudely cooked as they were, they proved very palatable, accompanied by small berries of a bluish color and black moss-berries, which grew there in abundance. \n \n He had passed the point where in May the Bradfords had left the main trail to turn toward the lake, when he descried a pack train approaching across an open meadow. As the caravan came nearer, David was convinced that he saw before him the owner of the cache and the canine. At the head of the procession leaped five or six dogs of fierce aspect. Following them came a round-shouldered old Irishman, riding on a big gray mule, and behind him was a string of mules loaded with sacks and boxes. \n \n The dogs set off toward David with a rush, as soon as they saw him, and it was all their master could do to check them. As it was, David made sure that his hatchet was free before he encountered the pack, and even had he brought that weapon into play, he would have been[300] overwhelmed in a twinkling had not the dogs been in evident fear of the old man. Having jumped about David noisily, but without offering violence, they passed on in obedience to a gruff command. The rider of the mule now drew up and eyed David in silence a moment. \n \n \"Where\u0027d ye come from?\" he asked, in a rather impertinent tone, as David thought. \n \n \"Champlain\u0027s Landing,\" said David, shortly. He was not in a mood to be trifled with. \n \n \"How far may it be to Pennock\u0027s Post?\" asked the stranger, still eying him suspiciously. \n \n \"All of fifteen miles,\" said David. \n \n \"Fifteen miles!\" exclaimed the man, in anything but a pleasant voice. \"I wouldn\u0027t have said \u0027twas that far,—an\u0027 it\u0027s there I must be to-night.\" Suddenly he glared again at David. \"An\u0027 where\u0027d ye stay last night?\" \n \n \"At Pennock\u0027s Post,\" said David. \n \n \"Stayed at Pennock\u0027s, did ye?\" snarled the old fellow. \"Didn\u0027t ye find something there, hey?\" \n \n This was just what David had been waiting for. Another moment, and he would have uncorked the explosive phials of wrath, but hearing a light footstep he turned, and the next instant, without a single angry word, set his lips hard. \n \n It was neither fear nor irresolution which occasioned this remarkable change on David\u0027s part, but a delicate,[301] chivalrous sense of the consideration a man always owes to the gentler sex. On turning his head, he became aware, for the first time, of the presence of a woman. \n \n She was slender, gray-haired, and gentle-faced. She was neatly dressed in black, and had been walking behind the pack train. It flashed through David\u0027s mind instantly that this was the old man\u0027s wife, and he was conscious of a feeling of pity. Furthermore, she was the first white woman he had seen for many months. It was a delight just to look at her. Quarrel in her presence he could not, nor add one jot to the burden which he felt sure she must bear as the consort of such a man. \n \n It was the sight of this elderly woman which had sealed his lips, and now, to the astonishment of her husband, David turned and walked away without a reply. The woman spoke to him kindly as he passed, and he touched his cap respectfully. Hardly had he cleared the pack train before he heard the old man belaboring the mule on which he rode, and swearing roundly at the other animals. He wondered if the poor wife would have to walk those fifteen long miles while her husband rode. \n \n Not long afterward he met a second section of the train, in charge of a tall, broad-shouldered fellow, who evidently preferred not to overtake his employer. \n \n David pressed on with all possible speed, but since noon his left foot had been giving him pain, and he now became more crippled with every step. Whether it was[302] rheumatism or a bruise or strain he did not know, but by the time he reached the river he was ready to drop. \n \n To his delight, a large tent on the hither bank indicated the presence of some one at the ford, and he had no doubt he could cross dry-shod on the morrow. On reaching this tent he was surprised to find no one within, but, confident that the owner was near, he threw off his pack with a sigh of relief, and stretched himself wearily on a pile of canvas coverings. \n \n An hour or more had dragged by when David saw a slender young man, with a bushy brown beard, leading a bony horse toward the opposite bank of the river. He mounted at the ford, and, having crossed, took off the saddle and turned the steed loose. \n \n \"How are you?\" said the stranger cordially, as he noticed David. \"Been here long?\" \n \n \"About an hour,\" answered David. \"I thought you wouldn\u0027t mind my resting here.\" \n \n \"Not at all. Make yourself at home. Didn\u0027t see anything of a stray mule round here, did you? I\u0027ve been hunting that mule all the afternoon, but I can\u0027t find the critter.\" \n \n \"No, I didn\u0027t see it.\" \n \n \"I s\u0027pose you met the old man? He owns this outfit here.\" \n \n \"Oh, ho!\" exclaimed David. \"Is that so?\" A sudden light came into his eyes, and traces of a smile appeared[303] at the corners of his mouth. \"What sort of a man is he?\" he asked. \n \n \"Well,\" replied Smith,—he had informed David that such was his name, and Yonkers, New York, his home,—\"he\u0027s different from any Irishman I ever saw. Hasn\u0027t any more sense of humor than a cow, and he\u0027s the worst-tempered man in this whole country. Look at that sick horse and you\u0027ll see how he treats his animals, and he don\u0027t treat his wife and us men much better. He\u0027s going to winter on a claim of his near Dawson, and wants me to work for him up there, but I don\u0027t know about it. I\u0027d never have started with him if I\u0027d known him. He hasn\u0027t paid me a cent of wages yet, and I don\u0027t believe he intends to.\" \n \n David saw that he had a friend and sympathizer in Smith. \n \n \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027m going to do,\" said he, \"provided you\u0027re willing. I\u0027m going to sleep in the tent to-night. If a man ever owed me a night\u0027s lodging, he\u0027s the man.\" And David told how he had been locked out of his own house, and cheated out of his rest. \n \n \"Well, well!\" exclaimed Smith, when he heard the tale. \"I just wish you could have put some lead into that dog. You\u0027d have been perfectly justified. I guess you\u0027re entitled to rather more than a night\u0027s lodging. If the miserly old fellow had left me anything to eat, I\u0027d see that you had a good supper and breakfast, but he[304] took every scrap of bacon with him, and I\u0027ve only flour and coffee to live on till he gets back.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve a pretty good chunk of bacon, but no flour,\" said David. \"We\u0027d better join forces. I\u0027ll contribute the bacon if you\u0027ll make some flapjacks.\" \n \n Smith gladly assented, so it was not long before David was eating a supper partly at his own, but largely also at the disagreeable packer\u0027s expense. Doubtless because it is human nature to enjoy levying a just tax on a mean man, he swallowed those flapjacks and drank that coffee with peculiar zest. \n \n The meal was no sooner finished than Smith caught sight of the truant mule on a distant hillside and set off to capture it, while David spread his blankets within the tent and presently turned in. He slept soundly till broad daylight, when he awoke with a start and found a fat ground-squirrel sitting comfortably on his breast, and eying him complacently. It ran out as soon as he stirred, and then amused itself by running up the roof of the tent on one side, and sliding down the other. Altogether it was the most lively ground-squirrel he had seen. \n \n This day was Sunday, and aside from the principle of the thing, David would have liked to rest on account of his lameness, but circumstances were against him. It was clearly necessary that he should make an exception to the usual rule of the Bradfords, and travel throughout[305] this Sabbath. Smith\u0027s stock of food was running as low as his own. Breakfast over, he himself had only a piece of jerked beef and two biscuits for a luncheon. His only course was to proceed. \n \n Smith caught and saddled the poor horse, which had been a fine animal, but was now so weak with overwork, starvation, and sickness that it could hardly stand. David mounted with misgivings as to whether the tottering beast had strength to carry him, but they crossed the ford in safety. Dismounting on the farther bank, he turned the horse back into the water, and headed him for the point where Smith was standing; then shouting his thanks and a good-by, he limped off along the trail. \n \n Twenty miles on a foot which could scarcely bear the touch of the ground! He set his teeth hard and plodded on until the pain compelled him to sit down for a brief rest. Every mile was earned with suffering. All day long the struggle continued, and it required all the grit he possessed to keep him going. Not a person did he see, though he caught sight of several horses grazing, and heard distant shouts of men who were probably searching for them. At seven in the evening he threw himself into Reitz\u0027s camp utterly spent. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48556.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
