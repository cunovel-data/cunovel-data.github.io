{"id":42069,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVII THROUGH THE ICE","content":"With daylight it was seen that the tent of David and Roly, which had formed the western end of the hut, was almost wholly destroyed; but with the exception of several holes in a corner of the fly, the large tent had escaped injury. This outcome was fortunate, for an extra small tent had been provided. As for the bedding, the fine gray blankets were not harmed in the least, but the down quilts, which had been spread over them, suffered numerous punctures from the falling sparks, so that the feathers flew in clouds whenever the quilts were moved, and it was necessary to sew up the holes before setting out on the day\u0027s march. \\n\\n \\n\\n The outlet of the lake, which they reached at noon, was a stream fifty feet in width, and passed at first through a swampy region. Here, in the tall dry marsh-grass, there were pools of open water. Camp was made on a bluff,—the first high land beyond the swamp. A warm south breeze blew steadily, and Uncle Will said it was doubtless the wind known in the Pacific States as the \"chinook.\" It might be expected to continue without intermission[143] for two or three weeks, and would make a quick end of the sledding. Already the southern slopes of the hills were bare, and many of them were green with killikinick, a low plant with red berries and small evergreen leaves, not unlike those of garden box. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry for our mysterious friends,\" said Mr. Bradford, as he finished pitching the large tent. \"They\u0027ll be stranded on bare ground pretty soon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s so,\" said Uncle Will. \"They\u0027ll cross the lake all right, but I think the ice will go out of this river in two or three days. We\u0027re none too soon ourselves. Hello! the wild geese have come.\" He pointed to a dozen great gray birds, flying in a wedge-shaped flock, and crying, \"Honk! honk!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re coming down,\" exclaimed Roly, excitedly. \"Mayn\u0027t I go over there, Father? I\u0027m sure I could shoot some of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied Mr. Bradford; \"but I\u0027ll go with you, because the ice is treacherous in the swamp, and, besides, you are not quite expert yet in the use of the gun.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bring us the fattest bird in the flock,\" shouted Uncle Will, as they departed; \"and we\u0027ll have a royal supper.\" So saying, he fell to mending the gee-pole of his sled. With David\u0027s assistance, the pole was soon as good as new. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now,\" said Uncle Will, \"where\u0027s your rifle, Dave?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Packed on my sled.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [144] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go and get it. I saw some ducks in a stretch of open water back here, and maybe we can do a little hunting on our own account.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This proposal tickled David immensely. He brought the rifle and a handful of cartridges, and the two set off in a direction not quite parallel to that taken by Mr. Bradford and Roly. A half-mile walk brought them in sight of the ducks, five of them, near the icy edge of a small opening; and by lying flat on the ice, they were able to creep and slide toward them under cover of a clump of tall reeds. At length Uncle Will whispered to David to take careful aim at one of them and fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n David was already sighting along the gun-barrel—his finger on the trigger—when the report of Roly\u0027s shot-gun rang out behind a small thicket of willows. The ducks at once took flight, to David\u0027s great disappointment, but at the same moment the geese appeared, flying in a confused manner directly toward their ambush. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Quick, Dave, give me the gun,\" cried Uncle Will. \\n\\n \\n\\n David instantly passed it over, and wonderingly watched his uncle as he tossed it up to his shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bang!\" went the rifle, and down tumbled a big bird from the centre of the flock,—as fine a fat goose as ever graced a table. David fairly danced with delight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There!\" said Uncle Will, with a merry twinkle in his eye; \"I\u0027ll wager that this was the very goose Roly meant to kill.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [145] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you think he shot any, then?\" asked David. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I fancy the chances are he didn\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so it proved, when the four hunters reunited and compared notes. David described his uncle\u0027s marksmanship with great enthusiasm, and Mr. Bradford and Roly were quite ready to admit the brilliance of the feat. \\n\\n \\n\\n In two places, next morning, the stream, on whose frozen surface they travelled, broadened into lakelets, where progress over the smooth ice was rapid and easy, but as soon as these were passed and the stream narrowed again, difficulties appeared. Water was beginning to flow over the ice through numerous cracks, and as the day advanced, many openings had to be avoided. Often the centre of the river was wholly free from ice, only a narrow strip remaining along each bank. In such cases, they proceeded with great caution. The banks themselves were usually impassable, by reason of thickets and trees, and the ice-strips offered the only highway, but they were tilted at such an angle that the sleds were constantly slipping sideways toward the water. At the worst spots the united efforts of the party were required to move each load safely past. \\n\\n \\n\\n At length a point was reached, where they seemed absolutely blocked. The firm ice on one side abruptly ended on a curve of the stream, and it was necessary to cross to the other side. There was ice in the centre at this point, but evidently too weak to bear a man\u0027s weight.[146] The boys could see no solution of the problem, except that of retracing their steps. But the ice in the centre had been weak for a long distance, and nobody wished to go back over such a weary course on the slim chance of finding a crossing. It was Mr. Bradford who overcame this emergency. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let us build a brush bridge,\" suggested he. \"I believe it would distribute our weight, and make the passage safe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The very thing,\" said Uncle Will, approvingly. \"Strange I didn\u0027t think of so simple a scheme.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n All hands fell to work at once, chopping down willows and alders. Two strong poplar saplings were laid across the weak ice three feet apart, and the brush was thrown thickly over them. The Indians tested this rude bridge, and the others followed, all passing over in safety. \\n\\n \\n\\n But they were not destined to unbroken good fortune. It was soon necessary to cross to the east bank again. This time, although there were three inches of water on the ice in mid-stream, the ice itself appeared to be reinforced by a second layer which had been thrust beneath it. Coffee Jack and Lucky examined the situation with care, then crossed with two sleds. Roly, David, and Mr. Bradford followed without mishap. Then Uncle Will, the heaviest of the party, attempted to do likewise; but in the very centre of the river the[147] rotten ice gave way without a moment\u0027s warning, and down went man and sled into the cold, muddy water. It was deep, too,—so deep that Uncle Will did not touch the bottom,—and as for the sled, only the tip of the gee-pole remained above the surface. Fortunately, the current here was not swift. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stand back, boys!\" commanded Mr. Bradford, who saw in an instant the thing to be done. Rushing to the shore, he cut a long willow with one sweep of his knife, then, running to the edge of the hole, where his brother had managed to support himself by treading water and grasping the broken ice-cakes, he held out the end of the branch. Uncle Will caught this, and was pulled to the edge of the strong shore-ice, where he was seized by willing hands and drawn forth, his teeth chattering, but his usual undaunted smile still in evidence as he remarked, \"They s-say it\u0027s a good th-thing to keep c-c-cool in case of accident. N-nobody can say I\u0027m not c-cool!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This unexpected sally drew a burst of merriment from the boys, who, now that the danger was over, were quite ready to appreciate the humorous side of the incident. They admired their uncle more than ever for his happy way of making light of discomforts. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the sled and its precious provisions were still in the water, and no time must be lost in rescuing them. How to do it, was the question. The gee-pole was too far from the strong ice to be reached. If the thin ice,[148] against which it rested, were broken, it would probably sink out of sight altogether. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lucky finally fished up the drag-rope by means of a long pole, and thus the sled was drawn toward the shore ice. All now took hold, and their combined strength sufficed to haul it out of the water. Its load was quickly unpacked, the sacks of flour were set on end in the sun to drain and dry, as the dampness had not penetrated more than half an inch through the canvas, and the contents of the clothing bag were spread upon a log. A bag of sugar was the only total loss. Meantime, a huge fire was built on the bank, in the warmth of which Uncle Will changed his clothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n Further progress that day was unadvisable, and indeed, Uncle Will declared that if they had covered seven miles, as he believed was the case, they were practically at their journey\u0027s end. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48537.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
