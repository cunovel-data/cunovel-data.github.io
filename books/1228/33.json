{"id":42084,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII CHAMPLAIN\u0027S LANDING","content":"It was well into the evening, though before sunset, when Champlain assured his fellow-voyagers that the Landing was near. Soon afterward, they saw two men appear on the brow of a sandy bluff ahead. These proved to be Hovey and Herrick, who were in charge of the camp. They had heard voices and the plash of oars, and had hurried out to see who was approaching, waving their hats and shouting a welcome as soon as they recognized their friends. The boat was brought close to the narrow beach, and the captain, Dunn, and Greenwood disembarked, leaving Champlain and David to row around to the other side of the bluff, where the craft could be more securely moored. \\n\\n \\n\\n David was now accustomed to the interminable windings of the river, and took it quite as a matter of course that the stream, after flowing a quarter of a mile to the left or southwest from the bluff, turned capriciously back to within fifty yards of the spot where the three had landed. The bluff itself was thus a narrow, high neck of land connecting a low, wooded point with what we may call the mainland east of the river. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rafting down the North Alsek \\n\\n \\n\\n [265] \\n\\n \\n\\n With oars and paddle, the crew of two soon rounded the point, and approached the bluff once more. Here the river turned abruptly northwest, and in the bay formed by its curve lay a flotilla of log rafts. To one of these the boat was made fast, and the occupants sprang ashore and made their way up the slope. \\n\\n \\n\\n David looked with interest at the place which for a fortnight was to be his home. The top of the bluff was about thirty feet wide, and covered with short grass. It was as level as a floor, except along its southeastern edge, where a ridge of sand six or eight feet high, and fringed with spruces, offered a natural protection for a cook-tent and a sleeping-tent. Champlain, who had discovered this spot, took pride in pointing out to David its advantages. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s the finest place in this valley for a camp or a fort,\" he declared, with a Frenchman\u0027s enthusiasm. \"Every time I look at it, I almost wish there was an Indian war, and I had a good garrison here. You see, it\u0027s defended on three sides by the river, which is too deep for fording, and can only be crossed with canoes or logs, or by swimming. From the top of the bluff we have a clear view for an eighth of a mile both up and down the stream. If the enemy came down the river, the ridge of sand behind the tents is a natural breastwork for riflemen; while if they approached from the other direction, the defenders would simply lie down a little back from[266] the edge of the bluff on that side, and give them a good peppering.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what if they came from the land side?\" asked David, who began to wonder if an attack were within the bounds of possibility. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We should put a stockade of logs across the neck of land on that side,\" answered Champlain. \"Already I have built a strong log house. Come and see it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He led the way landward from the narrow part of the bluff to a point about a hundred yards up-stream, where David now beheld the neat little cabin in which the supplies were stored. It had a door of boards, evidently constructed from the material of a coffee-box, but there was no window, either because no more boards were to be had, or because the cabin was less vulnerable with but a single opening in its heavy walls. The door was fitted with good hinges and a padlock. Forest enclosed the cabin, except on the side from which they had come, and toward the river; and off among the trees wound a path which joined the main trail about fifty rods away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You won\u0027t have to fight Indians, my lad,\" said Champlain, who was aware that his imaginative talk might cause David some uneasiness; \"and as for bears, you don\u0027t seem to mind them much, judging from what I\u0027ve heard.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I can take care of the bears,\" said David. \\n\\n \\n\\n A Herd of Cattle.—Yukon Divide in the Distance \\n\\n \\n\\n [267] \\n\\n \\n\\n Champlain eyed the lad with evident approval. \"I like your pluck,\" said he; \"but let an old hunter advise you to leave such beasts alone, when you\u0027re not in reach of help. You see, we should never know where to look for you if you should meet with an accident off in these woods. Better stick pretty close to the cabin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n On their way back to the cook-tent Champlain pointed out a pile of saddles and blankets near the embers of a fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Must be a pack train somewhere about,\" he observed. \"I wonder where the men and horses are. It\u0027s too early for ours to be here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The explanation was quickly forthcoming. A large herd of cattle, convoyed by five or six horsemen, had arrived on the previous day on their way to Dawson, and had been halted for a day\u0027s rest at the Landing. The men were now rounding up their charges into an open meadow half a mile distant, preparatory to an early start in the morning. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you\u0027ll be very glad they came when you know what you\u0027re to have for supper,\" added Hovey, with a twinkle in his eye, as he bustled about the sheet-iron stove in the cook-tent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, we live high at this hotel!\" Herrick chimed in. \"How would fried liver strike you,—and hot biscuits and butter,—and tea with cream and sugar,—and a custard by way of dessert?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s this you\u0027re talking about?\" cried the captain,[268] who had overheard the last few words. \"Cream and custards? I\u0027ll believe when I see and taste!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, my sceptical friend! Come in. Supper\u0027s ready. Muck-muck!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n No second call was needed, for the travellers were ravenous. They entered the cook-tent at once, and took their places on empty boxes around a small improvised table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now then,\" said Hovey, who, with Herrick, had finished supper some three hours before, and now presided gracefully over the cook-stove in the interest of the guests, \"pass the plates.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n These much battered articles of aluminum were promptly presented, and as promptly filled with the savory contents of the frying-pan, which proved to be real liver, after all. Herrick meanwhile told how they had secured it. \\n\\n \\n\\n It appeared by his narrative that one of the steers had driven a sharp stick into its foot in such a way as to lame it badly. On noticing this, he had strongly represented to the cattlemen that it would be cruel to drive the animal farther, and that they ought to kill it then and there. Aided by several expressive winks, the cattlemen had seen the point of his remarks, and having found the two campers pleasant, sociable fellows, they killed the steer, and made them a present of a considerable portion of the carcass. The cream and custard were accounted for by the presence of a milch cow in the herd. \\n\\n \\n\\n [269] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To-morrow,\" said Herrick, as he finished his tale, \"we shall have roast beef with brown gravy; and if they can catch the cow, we may get a drink of milk all around.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What would the boys at Shorty Creek say, if they heard that?\" asked Greenwood, smacking his lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027d mutiny,\" replied Dunn. \"But is this the only cattle train that has come along?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" answered Hovey. \"This is the third big one within a couple of weeks, and they all belong to one man. There have been some smaller herds, too. Over a thousand head must have gone over this trail this season, and they\u0027re in prime condition. They ought to sell high in Dawson, for the Yukon steamers can\u0027t carry cattle to any great extent, and there must be thousands of people there by this time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Next morning, previous to their departure, the cattlemen made an attempt to milk their solitary cow. Obviously the first thing to do was to catch the animal, but for some reason she was particularly contrary, and refused to be either coaxed or coerced. At last one of the men mounted his horse, and set out with his lariat to lasso the refractory beast in true cow-boy style. The poor cow, frightened out of her wits by the shouts and the turmoil, rushed frantically through thickets and over sand-banks, closely followed by the horseman, who, after several throws, succeeded in roping her and checking her wild career. \\n\\n \\n\\n [270] \\n\\n \\n\\n It now looked as if the drink of milk might materialize, but alas for human expectations! The cow had been wrought up to such a pitch of excitement by the events of the morning that she could not be made to stand still, and it was with great difficulty that the milking could be commenced. The man who essayed this task had all he could attend to with her kicking and plunging, and finally, losing all patience, he threw pail, milk, and all at her head, accompanied by something very like an oath. So faded the dream of the drink of milk. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hovey and Herrick, who had been informed that they were to take the boat and a moderate cargo and start for Moran\u0027s Camp, where they were to sign certain papers connected with their claims, now made ready to depart. They appeared to relish the idea of joining their comrades on the Kah Sha River, but David thought, as he watched them pull away against the current, that long before they could hoist their sail on Lake Dasar-dee-ash, they would wish themselves back at the Landing. The cattle train started toward Dawson about the same time, and Champlain\u0027s Landing was left to the captain\u0027s party. \\n\\n \\n\\n The following morning he, too, made ready to leave. The horses, which had now arrived, were loaded with the necessary provisions from the cache in the cabin, and David was given final directions about the camp.[271] \"Shep,\" an Indian dog which had accompanied the horses, was left with him as his sole companion, and then the captain, Champlain, Dunn, Greenwood, and the three packers bade him good-by and disappeared in the woods. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48552.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
