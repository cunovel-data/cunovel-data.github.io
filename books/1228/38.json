{"id":42089,"no":38,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVII HOMEWARD BOUND","content":"The condition of David\u0027s foot obliged him to remain two days at the fishing-camp with Reitz and Humphrey, who feasted him royally on fresh-caught salmon. Under the teaching of Reitz he soon acquired the knack of using the long gaff, tipped with an iron hook, with which the fish were caught. Standing on the bank beside one of the deeper pools of the Klukshu River, which here was little more than a brook, he would poke about the bottom with the gaff until it struck against a salmon, when by a quick and dexterous jerk the fish would be hooked and drawn up out of the water. Often the salmon were so heavy that they had to be dragged out rather than lifted, for fear of breaking the pole. The finest variety was the king salmon, very large and with flesh of a deep pink tint. Then there was a smaller kind whose flesh was red. Not infrequently a fish was caught which, in its long journey from the sea, had been bruised and gashed on the sharp rocks. Such were unfit for food, but the healthy salmon were[307] split and dressed and hung upon a frame of poles to dry, a smoky fire being built underneath to promote the curing and keep the flies from laying their eggs in the meat. The Stik Indians across the stream caught the salmon not only with the gaff, but also by a weir of poles which they constructed in the brook. In this trap hundreds were ensnared, and the natives were able to take a sufficient number to supply them with food throughout the winter and spring. One of the Indian women in this family was noticeable for a spike of wood or bone set in the flesh of her chin by way of ornament. On the third day David proceeded to Moran\u0027s Camp, accompanied by Humphrey, who carried a load of fresh salmon. Almost the first question asked of him there was, \"Where are Hovey and Herrick?\" \"Why,\" replied David, in astonishment, \"I supposed they were here long ago. It\u0027s a little over two weeks since they left Champlain\u0027s Landing in the boat.\" This intelligence caused a flutter of alarm in the camp of the Thirty-six, and a searching party would undoubtedly have been despatched on the following day had not the missing men turned up that evening, weather-browned and hungry, with a remarkable tale of obstacles encountered and overcome. They had been several days in forcing their heavy boat up the river to the lake, and there they had met with such continuous[308] head-winds and rough water that progress had been difficult and dangerous,—often, indeed, impossible. They had camped for days upon the shore with little to eat, waiting for a chance to proceed, and were almost despairing when the wind providentially changed. \"Hurrah!\" shouted Roly, when David appeared on Alder Creek. \"You\u0027re just in time, Dave. Now we can go out with the next pack train.\" David failed to grasp his enthusiastic brother\u0027s meaning until later, for he was immediately surrounded and made to sit down and relate all his adventures up to that moment. This done, he begged Roly for an explanation of his remark about going out. \"Why,\" said Roly, delightedly, \"we\u0027re all ready to start for home. Father or Uncle Will can tell you more about the reasons.\" The boy seemed as eager to go out of the country as he had once been to come into it. \"Yes,\" said Mr. Bradford, corroboratively, \"the leader of the Thirty-six wished to control the whole of the river and its tributary creeks, and instructed Mr. Scott, his second in command, to make us an offer for our claims. We thought the offer a fair one, and as we can not well winter here nor look after our claims another season, we have accepted his price.\" \"Good!\" said David. \"I\u0027m glad to hear it.\" Uncle Will added that they had made arrangements[309] to accompany the next pack train of the Thirty-six when it returned to the coast. \"Do you mean that we shall ride out on horses?\" asked David, incredulously. The thought of such luxurious travelling after his recent hardships surpassed his wildest dreams. \"No,\" answered his uncle. \"The horses will carry our loads, but it isn\u0027t likely we shall ride except in fording the rivers. I understand it\u0027s extremely perilous to try to cross the Alsek, the Klaheena, and the Salmon rivers without horses, and several men have been drowned this season in the attempt. Even horses are sometimes swept away. You must know that in summer these streams, fed by the melting ice and snow in the mountains, become swift, muddy torrents of far greater depth and force than in the winter. Streams which a boy could wade last March would now give an elephant a tussle. It\u0027s most fortunate that we can have the use of the pack train.\" Two days later, on the fifth of August, word came that the horses had arrived at Moran\u0027s and would leave there the following evening on their return. Several of the animals were brought up to Alder Creek and loaded with the goods of the Bradfords, who of course had very little to carry out, compared with what they had brought in, since their provisions were nearly exhausted and they were to leave their tools and surplus goods[310] of all kinds with the Thirty-six. Lucky and Coffee Jack were also to be left behind in the employment of the larger party. On their way down the river the Bradfords paused at the tent of the scurvy-stricken Tom Moore to leave him some delicacies and wish him a speedy recovery. Here also they exchanged farewells with King and Baldwin. Not far above Moran\u0027s Camp David discovered a gray boulder thickly studded with fossil trilobites, which he would have liked to present to the museum at home, but its great weight made its removal impossible. Having taken leave of the Thirty-six, and of Lucky and Coffee Jack, who had served them so long and faithfully, the Bradfords followed the horses to the valley below, where they were to spend the night. The pack train was in charge of a tall, lean, brown-whiskered man known as Bud Beagle, and two assistant packers, one of whom, a big, thick-set, good-natured Missourian, went by the name of Phil. The other, a gray-haired man named Joyce, had once kept a bookstore in one of the Eastern States, and now, after a life of varied fortunes, found himself a packer and cook on the Dalton trail. Phil made an important find soon after the camping-place was reached. He came upon some bushes loaded with ripe red currants not far below the mouth of the[311] gorge, and, having gathered a heaping panful, brought them to Joyce, who gladly set about making some currant preserve in the most approved style. He boiled the currants over a hot fire, added an extravagant amount of sugar, and at length produced the most delicious mixture imaginable. As the night was fair, no tents were pitched. The blankets were spread on the grass under the open sky, and the party would have spent a comfortable night had not the weather turned frosty. So cold was it that a skim of ice formed in a pail of water which was left uncovered. \"Gentlemen,\" said Bud, addressing the elder Bradfords at breakfast, \"if you take my advice, you\u0027ll start right away as soon as you\u0027ve finished. It\u0027ll take us an hour or two to round up and load the horses, but there\u0027s no need for you to wait. It\u0027s close on to thirty mile to Dalton\u0027s, and it would be late afore you got there if you was to start right now.\" Accordingly, the Bradfords were on the march before eight o\u0027clock. They paused for a salmon dinner at Reitz\u0027s camp, where the pack train overtook and passed them, then plodded on again. It was the longest day\u0027s march in their experience, and without special incident save the meeting with a large herd of cattle and a flock of sheep bound for Dawson. Near the trading-post a party of mounted police were[312] building a cabin. They hospitably invited the tired four in to supper, treating them to roast mutton, for which the recently passing flock had evidently been laid under contribution. During the meal Mr. Bratnober strolled in and entertained them with an account of a long journey to the headwaters of White River, from which he had just returned. He had been accompanied by Jack Dalton and a tall native called Indian Jack. Their object had been to find copper, and they had been successful. Mr. Bratnober exhibited several rough slabs of the pure metal as big as a man\u0027s hand, and said that he had brought back about thirty pounds of it, and could have picked up tons if there had been means to carry it. He naturally would not tell the exact locality where these riches were discovered, but said it was in a region never before explored by white men. They had not remained in the copper district as long as they had wished to do, because of a band of Indians, armed only with bows and arrows, who had made hostile demonstrations. From the police the Bradfords learned that Dalton\u0027s store had been robbed of several thousand dollars a few days before, while Ike Martin was temporarily absent, and that about the same time two prospectors had been held up by highwaymen on the trail and relieved of considerable gold dust. Search was being made for the robbers, who were supposed to be two[313] tough-looking characters who had been seen around the premises, and Ike Martin had started for Pyramid Harbor to put the authorities there on the watch. Ike, imprudently, as the police thought, had taken quite a sum of his own money with him, which he purposed to send to a Seattle bank. \"Have you any idea who the robbers are?\" asked Uncle Will of the police captain. \"Yes,\" replied that officer; \"we think they are two of \u0027Soapy\u0027 Smith\u0027s gang. The suspicious characters seen here answered the description of two of \u0027Soapy\u0027s\u0027 men.\" \"And who is \u0027Soapy\u0027 Smith?\" asked Mr. Bradford, who had heard the name, but could not recall in what connection. \"Why,\" explained the officer, \"he\u0027s that chap who organized a gang of toughs at Skagway last winter and terrorized the place. Finally he insulted the wrong man, and received a quieting dose of lead; after which the citizens drove his followers out of town, and they scattered over the various trails.\" Uncle Will said nothing, but the boys noticed that he puffed with unwonted vigor on his pipe and seemed to be thinking deeply. He was, indeed, thinking that it would be a serious matter to encounter those two desperadoes in a lonely part of the trail.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48557.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
