{"id":42060,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII SLEDDING","content":"The following day was Sunday, and they rested in camp. \n \n Saturday night\u0027s storm had ceased before daybreak, and fortunately but an inch of snow had fallen,—not enough to interfere with their progress. The tents were brushed clean of the feathery flakes early on Monday morning, before being taken down and folded for the journey. \n \n Breakfast over, Uncle Will declared that no time must be lost in loading up the sleds. It had been decided that for the first day David should draw a load of one hundred and seventy-five pounds, and Roly one hundred and fifty. The remainder was to be evenly distributed between the three long sleds drawn by Mr. Bradford, Uncle Will, and Long Peter, each of whom would have about four hundred and fifty pounds. Such a load could only be drawn where the trail followed ice or level snow-crust. In soft snow or on hills, Uncle Will said they would have to take half a load forward and then return for the rest. The boys were sure they could haul heavier loads than those assigned to them; but their elders preferred[61] not to overtax their strength, feeling that growing lads ought not to go to the extreme of exhaustion. \n \n David selected for his load his clothing bag, which weighed fifty pounds, two fifty-pound sacks of flour, a wide flat box of spices, and his rifle and snow-shoes. While his uncle showed him how to distribute the articles to the best advantage, and bind them securely with a lashing-rope passed through the side loops of the sled and over and around the load in various directions, Roly proceeded, with the assurance of youth, to load his sled unaided. He first put on two twenty-five pound boxes of hard-tack, then his clothing bag and a sack of flour, followed by his shot-gun and snow-shoes, and tied them all on as securely as he could. When his uncle had finished his instructions to David, he was surprised to find Roly\u0027s sled already loaded and lashed. \n \n \"There, Uncle Will,\" said Roly, proudly, as that gentleman approached, \"I\u0027ve done it alone. You won\u0027t have to waste any time on me.\" \n \n \"Ah!\" said Uncle Will, \"so I see.\" But Roly did not notice the amusement in his eyes as he surveyed the work. \n \n \"Now, boys,\" he continued, after a moment, \"there\u0027s one thing more, and you can be doing it while the rest of us are lashing our loads. Do you see those two iron rings just above the forward end of the sled-runner on the right side?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" answered David and Roly. \n \n [62] \n \n \"Well, they are intended to hold the \u0027gee-pole\u0027 in place. Do you know what a gee-pole is?\" \n \n The boys had never heard of the contrivance in question. \n \n \"It is a pole,\" explained their uncle, \"about seven feet long, which extends forward from the right side of the sled, and serves as an aid in guiding. If you should try to guide your sled with the drag-rope alone, you would find that it would swerve on every uneven spot, and slip sideways on a slope, and dig its nose into the sides of the trail where the snow is soft; but with your right hand on a firm-set gee-pole, you will be able to steady your sled and guide it accurately where the trail is rough or rutty. The sled will answer to the lightest touch on the gee-pole. You can cut four of the poles in that thicket on the hillside yonder, and fit them into the rings. I believe Long Peter has already supplied himself with one.\" \n \n Roly and David, after several minutes\u0027 search, found four straight saplings of the required length and thickness, and cut them down with their hatchets. The large ends they trimmed to the right size, and inserted them through the rings of the sleds, making them firm by driving chips wedgewise between the iron and the wood. \n \n At eight o\u0027clock all was ready, and the procession started with Long Peter in the lead. Behind them lay the mud flats, with the shining water in the distance.[63] Before them to the northward stretched a broad and level expanse of snow, with here and there a patch of ice swept clean by the wind. The snow was almost as hard as the ice, and afforded a good running surface for the sleds. On either side of this broad valley of the Chilkat rose high, wooded hills, and behind them glittering peaks from which the snow would not entirely disappear even in midsummer, so Long Peter informed them. \n \n For this kind of travelling the spiked \"creepers\" were a necessity, enabling the feet to obtain a firm hold on the alternate lanes of ice and icy snow. They were worn beneath the rubber shoe-packs, and fastened to the feet by leathern thongs. \n \n They had not proceeded far, when they came to a low ridge or bank, so steep that Uncle Will was obliged to go to the assistance of the Indian. When the first load had been forced up the incline, the Indian returned with Uncle Will, and the two pushed up the second sled. Mr. Bradford and David followed with the third, the former pulling on the drag-rope, and his son pushing on the rear of the load. David was able to draw his own light load up the slope without assistance, and Roly came close behind him. \n \n Unfortunately for Roly, he did not attack the ridge directly but diagonally, which brought one sled-runner higher than the other. In an instant over went the sled upon its side. \n \n [64] \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter, Roly?\" shouted Uncle Will, who had been watching from the other side of the bank. \n \n \"My sled\u0027s upset,\" answered Roly, ruefully, \"and the load is all loose.\" \n \n \"And why should your sled have upset when none of the others did?\" \n \n \"I suppose it was because I didn\u0027t go up the hill straight.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s only a part of the reason,\" said Uncle Will, good-naturedly, as he came up and scanned the pile. \"I expected this very thing. Don\u0027t you see why? You put the cracker boxes, the lightest part of your load, underneath, and the heavy flour sack and clothing bag above. The whole affair is top-heavy. And everything is loosened by the fall, because you did not cinch your lashing-rope. Now let us load up properly. First put the two bags on the sled, then the boxes on top of them—so. Now the load doesn\u0027t look as well as it did, before, nor seem quite so capable of maintaining its balance, but you will find that, as a matter of fact, it will ride much better. \n \n \"Pass the lashing-rope over or around each article separately, and then back and forth over the whole load, cinching it at each side loop as you pass it through. Now, should your final knot loosen, it will not affect the whole load, but the boxes on top, and the trouble can be remedied instantly, the cinches holding the rest of the[65] load firm all the while. It is not always a waste of time, my lad, to take instructions when they are first offered, but I wanted you to have a practical demonstration of the results of poor loading. Now we shall get along famously.\" \n \n At noon, when they halted for a luncheon of cold salt pork previously cooked, hard-tack, and cold, clear water from a spring on the eastern hill under which they were resting, Uncle Will estimated that they had covered nine miles,—an excellent morning\u0027s work. They had crossed the Chilkat River once at least, and possibly several times, but as river and gravel flat were here alike covered with ice and snow, they were unable to distinguish the one from the other. \n \n \"I couldn\u0027t eat such a piece of fat pork at home to save my life!\" declared Roly, as he took a huge bite from a generous slice. \"It would make me sick.\" \n \n \"I rather think it would,\" said David; \"but here nothing seems to hurt us. How good and sweet it tastes! My! but I\u0027m hungry.\" \n \n \"And I too,\" said Mr. Bradford. \"I can feel my old-time strength coming back with every breath of this air. In a week or two, Will, I shall be as rugged as you are.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve no doubt of it,\" said his brother; \"and your beard is getting a beautiful start, too. The boys won\u0027t be able to tell us apart after a little.\" \n \n \"Never fear, Uncle,\" laughed David. \"Unless you[66] give up smoking, or Father begins it, we shall have no difficulty. You and your pipe are inseparable.\" \n \n \"True enough,\" said Uncle Will. \"My pipe is home and wife and children to me.\" He lighted a match, and was soon puffing away with great satisfaction. \n \n \"How far are we to go this afternoon?\" inquired Roly, abruptly. \n \n \"Are you tired?\" asked his uncle, before he answered. \n \n \"No,\" said Roly, stoutly. \"I could keep on all day, if the country is as level as this.\" \n \n \"Well, then,\" said his uncle, \"we\u0027ll try to make nine miles more. But if you get very tired, don\u0027t hesitate to say so.\" \n \n After an hour\u0027s rest they proceeded, halting at intervals, as they had done during the morning. While travelling they were too warm to wear the Mackinaw coats, and these were thrown across the loads, but at every halt they were resumed to prevent too rapid cooling. At times they saw the \"creeper\" marks of the Mysterious Thirty-six, and Uncle Will said he felt sure that the large party left the cave on the very morning of the day they—the Bradfords—had reached it. If that were the case, he thought they could be overtaken soon, for, as a rule, a small party could move more rapidly than a large one. \n \n Late in the afternoon, the treeless expanse of the river-bottom became narrowed by broken ground covered with[67] a forest which encroached from the west. The trail followed by the Indian led them into the midst of this forest, taking the course of a small stream which wound through it. In places, no ice had formed along the bank, and the bottom of the brook could be seen to consist of a rusty red mud. Long Peter drank very sparingly of this water, and cautioned the others, saying several times, \"No good, no good.\" \n \n \"Why isn\u0027t it good?\" asked Roly, to whom the water looked clear enough. \n \n \"It may be swamp water,\" answered his uncle, \"or it may be heavily charged with minerals. Perhaps it would not hurt you, but it is always best to follow the advice of the natives in such matters. They are careful to choose only pure streams or springs for drinking purposes, and this brook appears to be impregnated with bog iron, so probably the water comes from some stagnant pond.\" \n \n Soon after five o\u0027clock, when Mr. Bradford and the boys were growing very weary, and even Uncle Will, who was accustomed to the work, had admitted that the march was a long one, Long Peter gave a satisfied grunt and pointed forward. The others looked, and saw a row of tent-poles on a low bluff. They had reached the spot where the Thirty-six had spent the previous night. \n \n \"Good!\" exclaimed Uncle Will. \"We\u0027ve made as long a march as they did, sure enough, though we[68] haven\u0027t come more than seven miles this afternoon. We will camp right here, and thank the mysterious gentlemen for the use of their poles and boughs.\" \n \n On the succeeding day, there was a well-defined trail, much cut up by the heavy sleds of the party ahead, for the snow was now deep and rather soft. In spite of the excellent manner in which the three long sleds were loaded, and the care with which they were drawn, upsets occurred quite frequently, and even the light loads of Roly and David sometimes overturned in the deeper ruts. Re-lashing was seldom necessary, however, thanks to the instructions of Uncle Will. \n \n As the sun mounted higher, the snow became softer, and progress increasingly difficult. To deviate from the beaten path was to sink hopelessly, while to remain in it was to encounter hollows and ruts, from which two men could hardly extricate a single sled. They were constantly obliged to help each other, and at last Uncle Will gave orders to wait until the snow hardened again in the afternoon. By nightfall, they had covered about nine miles, reaching a point opposite the Indian village of Klukwan, which lay on the eastern bank of the river. Here again they found a deserted camp. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48528.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
