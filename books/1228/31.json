{"id":42082,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXX WASHING OUT THE GOLD","content":"\"Hello! you\u0027ve brought us a trout, have you?\" cried Uncle Will, cheerily, as he untied Roly\u0027s pack. The boy had succeeded in reaching Alder Creek during the morning period of low water. \n \n \"Yes,\" said Roly, and related his experiences to the interested group. \n \n \"You got along better at this end of the journey than I feared you would,\" said his father. \"I expected you yesterday, and when I saw how high the water would be, I went down to the mouth of the gorge to help you, but there were no signs of you at seven o\u0027clock.\" \n \n \"You must come and see the rocker and sluice-boxes as soon as you\u0027re rested,\" said David. \"We\u0027ve not been idle here since you went away, I can tell you.\" \n \n Accordingly, after dinner Roly, armored at last with head-net and gloves, went out with David and Uncle Will to inspect the mining operations at the foot of the bank beside the creek. \n \n We have already described panning, the crudest manner of separating gold from gravel. The appliances[249] which Uncle Will and his helpers had now constructed were capable of doing much more work than the pan in a given time, yet required the expenditure of comparatively little labor. Uncle Will first called Roly\u0027s attention to the rocker, which at that moment was standing idle at the side of the stream. \n \n \"The rocker, or cradle,\" he explained, \"consists of a deep box set upon rounded rockers so that it can be swayed from side to side. Within the box are several inclined planes at different heights, covered with canvas and so arranged that water and gravel flowing down the upper one will pass from its lower edge through an aperture to the top of the one below, and from that to the next, until finally the stream issues near the bottom of the machine. Across these planes at intervals are nailed small strips of wood called riffles. A sieve is fitted to the top of the box, its bottom being made of a sheet of tin punched with numerous holes half an inch in diameter. Now let us see it work.\" \n \n So saying, he placed the rocker under the end of a wooden trough set in the bank at a height of three feet. A ditch had been hollowed along the bank to this trough from a point higher up the stream, and David now lowered a similar trough into the water at the upper end. This allowed a stream to come into the ditch from the creek. As soon as the water began to pour into the[250] sieve of the rocker, Coffee Jack, whom Uncle Will had summoned, threw into it a shovelful of gravel from the bottom of the bank. \n \n \"Now you see,\" said Uncle Will, as he gently rocked the machine from side to side, \"the water carries the sand and smaller pebbles, including the particles of gold, down through those holes and over the riffles on the inclined planes. The gold is so heavy that it lodges against the riffles, but the water, swashing from side to side as it flows down, carries most of the sand and gravel over the riffles and out at the bottom. The operation is almost instantaneous in the rocker, and gravel can be shovelled in quite rapidly, whereas it would take perhaps ten minutes to wash out a very little in a pan. When the sieve becomes choked, it is lifted up and the stones thrown out.\" \n \n Coffee Jack shovelled mechanically, as if all this fuss about the yellow metal were quite beyond his appreciation. In a few minutes Uncle Will released him and sent him back to help Lucky at the sluice. \n \n \"Now we\u0027ll take a look at the results,\" said Uncle Will, as he removed the sieve, picked out the riffles, which were loosely nailed, and carefully took up the canvas which covered the inclined planes. All the sand and gravel which remained upon the canvas he rinsed off into a pan and proceeded to wash it out at the stream after the usual method of panning. Roly[251] was delighted to see two little yellow nuggets appear, besides many small flakes and grains. \n \n \"There,\" said Uncle Will, as he finished, \"you see we have here the yield of several panfuls, and it has taken but a few minutes to secure it. The rocker is a handy machine to carry from place to place wherever, by panning, we find the gold most abundant.\" \n \n \"But what would you do without the ditch?\" \n \n \"We should pour in water from a pail. Now let us examine the sluice-boxes.\" \n \n Uncle Will led the way down the stream to the point where Lucky and Coffee Jack were at work. A second ditch, similar to the first, had been prepared for the sluicing; and the boxes, three in number, were set in the lower end of it, each consisting of a bottom board about twelve feet long and a foot wide, and two side boards of the same dimensions. The lower end of the first or upper box was reduced in width sufficiently to allow it to fit into the upper end of the second box, the latter fitting in like manner into the third, which extended slightly over the creek. All the boxes were inclined enough so that the water from the ditch would flow through them quite rapidly. Instead of transverse riffles, two sets of poles were laid lengthwise in the bottom of each box, each set having a length of about five and a half feet and consisting of three poles held an inch apart by pieces of wood nailed across their ends.[252] Into the upper end of the upper box Lucky was shovelling gravel, which was immediately swept through the three boxes by the strong current of water. Coffee Jack, shovel in hand, kept the larger stones moving when they threatened to choke up the boxes. At the lower end a stream of muddy water and gravel was constantly discharged into the creek, the impetuous current of which bore it instantly away. \n \n \"Sluicing,\" said Uncle Will, \"is another step forward in placer—or gravel—mining, since the sluice will handle more material than even the rocker. It is the favorite method on a claim of this character.\" \n \n \"And how is the gold caught here?\" asked Roly. \n \n \"It falls down between the poles, and is held there by its own weight and the cross-pieces.\" \n \n \"You must have had to do a lot of whip-sawing to make so many boards,\" observed the boy. \n \n \"Indeed we did,\" replied his uncle. \"That was the hardest part of the work. We built a saw-pit—that raised log platform over yonder—and there we did the sawing, Lucky standing on top of the log and holding the saw from above, while I was under the platform to guide it on the down stroke. I rather had the worst of it, for the sawdust came into my eyes. When your father returned from Dalton\u0027s, he took a turn at it, which gave me time to make the rocker.\" \n \n [253] \n \n \"How often do you take the gold out of the sluice-boxes?\" asked Roly. \n \n \"We may as well clear the boxes now,\" answered his uncle. \"It\u0027s three days since we began operations.\" \n \n Accordingly, the two Indians were sent off to cut firewood, and Uncle Will and Mr. Bradford, having despatched David to the head of the ditch to shut off the water, shovelled out of the boxes the stones and gravel which had lodged above the poles. Then, removing the poles, they scraped and washed into a pan at the lower end all which remained. There was a heaping panful. \n \n Uncle Will washed it out at a quiet eddy of the creek, while the others gathered around with suppressed excitement, for estimates of the value of this claim could be based upon the results. Little by little the gravel was reduced until the black sand and yellow particles alone remained. A portion of the sand Uncle Will was able to wash away by careful manipulating, but when he could safely continue the operation no longer, he brought a magnet into use, which quickly gathered up all the remaining specks of iron. A goodly mass of yellow metal shone in the bottom of the pan, which, when weighed, was found to be worth about sixty dollars. Among the little gold nuggets were discovered two larger ones of pure native copper. On the surface they were of a greenish hue, but when whittled with a knife their true character appeared. \n \n [254] \n \n \"That isn\u0027t exactly Klondike richness,\" said Uncle Will, as he held up to view the pan and its contents, \"but I doubt if we\u0027ve found the richest part of this claim. We\u0027ve been working in what is called bench gravel on the rim-rock. I wish we could get down to the low bed-rock near the present channel of the stream. We might find a first-rate pay-streak there.\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t we do it?\" asked Roly. \n \n \"I fear not. We\u0027ve tried it, and the Thirty-six have tried it; but the minute you go below the level of the stream, the water comes through the loose gravel faster than you can throw it out. For this reason the Thirty-six are working almost entirely in the gravel along the hillsides in former channels of the river. They\u0027ve begun two tunnels through the gravel on the rim-rock about fifty feet above the present stream.\" \n \n \"Well,\" remarked Mr. Bradford, cheerfully, \"even if we can\u0027t make more than twenty dollars a day, we can pay a good part of the expenses of our trip before the end of the season.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s true,\" said his brother. \"And, besides, we\u0027ve only to make another set of sluice-boxes to double our income. Lucky and Coffee Jack can work this one profitably, and you and I can take care of another, while the boys can work with the rocker almost anywhere. I haven\u0027t a doubt that we shall do far better than thousands who are now crowding over the White and Chilkoot[255] passes. Why, I feel amply repaid for all my labors by just looking at you, Charles. I never saw you in better health.\" \n \n Mr. Bradford laughed and rubbed his arm doubtfully. \"Maybe I look well,\" said he, \"but what a place this is for rheumatism! Evenings and mornings when the air is chill I can hardly move.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said Uncle Will, \"I can sympathize with you there. I feel it more or less myself, and I understand that two or three of the big party are fairly laid up with it. But I don\u0027t think we shall carry it home.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48550.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
