{"id":42073,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXI LAST DAYS AT PENNOCK\u0027S POST","content":"The Indian family hung about the premises more or less, hoping, no doubt, for more tea or another butter-can. They set steel traps in the neighboring sand-banks, and caught many ground-squirrels, some of which they offered to the white men for twenty-five cents a pair; but while ducks, ptarmigan, and occasionally a wild swan or rabbit could be shot, no one was inclined to buy. David and Roly thought, however, that it would do no harm to catch ground-squirrels for themselves, and they set about making snares. \n \n These were simple, and consisted of a strong but slender willow branch, fixed firmly in the bank high above the hole in a nearly horizontal position, a stronger stick similarly set between the other and the hole, and a piece of string with a slip-noose at one end. The other end of the string was tied to the extremity of the upper willow branch, which was then bent down until the noose hung over the hole. A small loop, slipped over the point of the lower stick, held the noose in position. \n \n All being ready, it was expected that Mr. Squirrel, coming out to take an airing, would run his head through[176] the noose, carrying it along with him until the loop slipped from the lower stick, thus releasing the elastic upper stick, which would jerk poor Mr. Squirrel into the air, and hang him for no greater fault than his ignorance. The theory was perfect, but in practice Mr. Squirrel displayed more cleverness than he had been given credit for. Sometimes he pushed the noose aside, and again he would slip through it, and though occasionally a snare was sprung, the denizens of the sand-bank always managed to get away. \n \n The boys therefore decided to try to buy two traps from the Indians; and one day, when the whole family was present, David gave them to understand by signs what was wanted. He shut his hands together with a snap, then held up two fingers. The old squaw quickly nodded her head, and jabbered some unintelligible gutturals, which might have been taken for a fit of choking, but it was evident that she was willing to sell two traps, and on the following day she brought them. \n \n \"Probably,\" said David, as he gave her two fifty-cent pieces, \"she is giving me the oldest and rustiest she has.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said Pennock, \"you can depend upon that. Better see if they\u0027ll work, before you buy \u0027em.\" \n \n The boys therefore snapped them once or twice, to make sure that they were in order. \n \n \"Now,\" said Roly, \"we must get her to show us how to set them in the holes,\"—whereupon he made a number[177] of signs, which she quickly comprehended. She took the traps to the nearest hole and placed them in the entrance, covering them with dry grass, so that the animals would not hesitate to walk over them. The traps proved so old and worn that very few squirrels were caught at first, but Mr. Bradford doctored them one day with a file, after which they were quite effective. \n \n Not many days later, the old squaw fell ill, and her consumptive son and one of her daughters came down in haste to the cabin, in the hope that the white men would aid them. It chanced that no one was at home but Pennock, he who most of all detested the Indians. \n \n The young woman, by signs and the few English words she knew, made known the state of the case, and urged the white man to come in person, while her brother, with a sweep of the hand toward the east, repeated the word \"gold\" over and over. He well knew what white men most covet. Pennock, however, did not believe the Indian knew any more about gold than he did. Furthermore, he was not a medical man, and felt that he could do no good by visiting the patient. But he made out that the trouble was a cough, and so without more ado he looked over his slender stock of medicines and picked out a mustard plaster, which he gave to the young woman, showing her by signs to dampen it and lay it on her mother\u0027s chest. The two Indians appeared genuinely grateful for the plaster, and offered fifty cents in payment,[178] which of course Pennock refused. So they went off with light hearts, to try the white man\u0027s remedy. \n \n \"Ah!\" exclaimed Uncle Will later, when Pennock related what he had done; \"for all your blustering the other day, you\u0027ve a soft spot under your waistcoat, I see. That\u0027s what I call returning good for evil.\" \n \n \"Maybe it was,\" said Pennock. \"I couldn\u0027t refuse the poor wretches.\" \n \n Whether the mustard plaster proved effective or not, the dwellers in the cabin never knew, for a day or two later the Indians disappeared, probably continuing their journey toward Hootchi, a Stik village fifty miles to the north. \n \n For a time nothing was learned of the fortunes of the large party which had toiled down the valley in April, beyond the fact that they had not been able to drag their sleds more than three miles. This news was brought by one of their number, who said that the sleds and most of the goods had been cached, and he had been left in charge. The others had taken from fifty to one hundred and twenty-five pounds, according to their size and strength, and had pushed ahead. \n \n A few small bands of Indians visited the cabin, but as they came from the south they had no news of the gold-seekers. With one of these bands were two dogs of moderate size, staggering under loads of forty and fifty pounds, while their lazy masters carried absolutely nothing[179] but the clothes they wore. Another party brought fresh whitefish, which they bartered for flour and coffee. Four cups of flour and a pound of coffee were accepted in exchange for seven fish, and both parties seemed pleased with the bargain. \n \n This incident prompted the Bradford boys to fish in the creek and river, but they met with no success, and concluded that it was yet too early. Coffee Jack, however, made a most welcome contribution to the larder one day, by coming in with his hat full of duck\u0027s eggs, which he had found in a swamp. \n \n At last, on the fifteenth of May, the leader of the Thirty-six returned with five white men and four Indians. Some of them were so worn with hunger and fatigue as to be hardly recognizable, and all were utterly discouraged. Their hopes were dispelled; they had found no gold. \n \n The big party had advanced more than fifty miles with their heavy loads, and had built two cabins to serve as starting-points for further explorations. The men who had remained there would have to draw on the cache near Pennock\u0027s Post very soon, and the leader had given them orders to raft these supplies down the river twenty-five miles to the point where the stream turned westward from the trail, and there establish a storehouse. Meanwhile, those with the captain were to go to the Kah Sha River claims and help the four who had been originally[180] left there. The captain himself intended to go to Pyramid Harbor with the Indians, and bring in a fresh supply of provisions on pack horses, as soon as there was grass enough along the trail for the subsistence of the animals. \n \n The men were given a hearty supper at Pennock\u0027s, for they sorely needed it. Indeed, they declared it was the first \"square meal\" they had enjoyed in two weeks. After a good night\u0027s rest and breakfast, they resumed their journey in better spirits. \n \n Five days later came a startling piece of information. Mr. Bratnober, a mining man well known on the Dalton trail, with a young man named Onderdonk and two Indian packers, stopped at the cabin on his way north. He said that war had broken out between the United States and Spain in April, and that Admiral Dewey had won a great victory at Manila. \n \n As may be imagined, this news wrought David and Roly up to the highest pitch of excitement. \n \n \"Just think,\" said they,—\"war for a month, and we didn\u0027t know it!\" \n \n For a moment, they almost regretted that they had come to such a far country, and they thought longingly of the stirring times at home. Their father and uncle were also much moved, and their first impulse was to drop everything and hasten back,—the one to protect his family, the other to enter the army or navy. But as they talked the matter over, they saw there was little likelihood[181] that the Spaniards could effect a landing on the American coast; and as to Uncle Will\u0027s enlistment, though that would have just suited his roving temperament, he decided, upon his brother\u0027s urgent request, to await fuller information. All agreed, however, that it would be wise to return at once to the Kah Sha River, a distance of thirty-five miles. \n \n There were several reasons for this move. The first and most imperative was the fact that their provisions at Pennock\u0027s would last but one week more. In the second place, they had demonstrated to their entire satisfaction that there was no gold worth mining in that vicinity, and the Thirty-six had found none farther north. Thirdly, there certainly was gold on their Alder Creek claims, and Lucky\u0027s nugget was probably now uncovered. Finally, they would be within thirty miles of Dalton\u0027s Post, and likely to hear more news from incoming prospectors. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48541.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
