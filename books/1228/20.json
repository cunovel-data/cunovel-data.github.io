{"id":42071,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX THE FIRST PROSPECT-HOLE","content":"It was now the first week in May. The snow was entirely gone from the lowlands, melted by the breath of the chinook. The creek was swollen to twice its normal size, and had overflowed its banks in many places, bursting its icy bonds and stranding the ice-cakes high among the bushes. As for the river, that, too, had freed itself, and its muddy current was rising inch by inch. On the mountains they could almost see the snow-line creep higher and higher each day, and soon on the lesser heights no snow remained except in the gullies, giving to the mountains a streaked aspect. \n \n Robins and song-sparrows put in an appearance, and ducks were everywhere. On the very first warm day, bees, flies, and a mosquito or two were thawed into life, and hummed and buzzed in the sunshine as if there had never been any winter. In every sandy bluff and bank the ground-squirrels, beautifully mottled little creatures, came out of their holes, and sat up on their haunches as stiff as a ramrod, with their fore-paws demurely folded on their breasts, and sunned themselves and cast curious glances at their new neighbors. \n \n [158] \n \n Purple crocuses blossomed in abundance, and everywhere grass was growing green and buds were starting. Spring had come! \n \n \"What do you think of a prospecting trip?\" asked Uncle Will of Pennock, one morning. \"I believe we can sink a shaft now.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s a good idea,\" said Pennock. \"The frost ought to be out of the upper soil by this time. If it isn\u0027t, we can thaw it with fire.\" \n \n \"The one thing I don\u0027t like about this place,\" continued Uncle Will, \"is that the creek seems to be deserted. We heard rumors of extraordinary richness here, and if there\u0027s any truth in them, there ought to be some signs of life hereabouts.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s so,\" admitted Pennock. \"It was Cannon who advised the Cap\u0027n to leave a few men here. He said he sunk a hole last year and found gold enough to make it worth while to explore more fully. What really brought our party into this country, though, was a report of a rich strike up above. That\u0027s where the rest of them have gone; but I don\u0027t know just how far it is.\" \n \n \"Well,\" said Uncle Will, \"the stories I heard may have been misleading. We\u0027ll see what there is here anyhow, and take our chances. By the way, there\u0027s another creek to the southeast yonder, where you see that gully in the mountain. We might send a party there.\" \n \n [159] \n \n To this proposition Pennock assented. Accordingly Mr. Bradford and Roly, with Large, Nichols, and the two Indians, set off toward the gully, which was about six miles distant, while Uncle Will, David, Pennock, Reitz, Adair, and Johnson started for the headwaters of the creek beside which they had camped,—a journey of four miles. We may as well follow the fortunes of the latter party. \n \n There was no trail worthy of the name, but once or twice hoof-marks were discovered, probably made by Cannon\u0027s pack horse the previous season. Sometimes they entered forests of standing spruce and poplar, either growing or fire-killed, and now it was a district of fallen trees, where it was almost impossible to advance, from which they emerged with a sigh of relief into some open grassy meadow near the stream, where walking was pleasant and easy. Presently they ascended a clay bluff a hundred feet high, skirting its edge where it was free from timber. From this vantage ground they could see the snowy peaks of the Dasar-dee-ash Mountains, thirty miles to the south, on the other side of which lay the claims they had taken in April. Uncle Will examined the fine clay of the bluff, and gave it as his opinion that it would make excellent bricks and pottery. \n \n In an hour and a half, they came to the foot-hills, where the stream fell noisily over a bed of boulders in a pretty glen. A sharp lookout was kept, but no signs[160] of Cannon\u0027s work were seen. At length it was decided to sink a hole on the south bank where a bed of gravel had been deposited by the water. From the nature of the rocks about them, they concluded that bed-rock was not far below the surface. Picks, shovels, and a gold-pan had been brought, and the men took turns at the digging. It was hard work, for many large stones were encountered frozen into their places, and these could only be pried loose at risk of a bent pick. When a depth of twelve inches was reached, Pennock filled the pan with a sample of the gravel, and took it to the stream, while the others, except Adair, who was swinging the pick, gathered around him, eager to know the result of the test. Not a color was found, but there was black sand and in it two small rubies. \n \n The discovery of the rubies did not seem to offset the disappointment of the men at finding no gold,—a fact at which David wondered, until his uncle informed him that those gems were quite commonly found in the Northwest, and such small ones were of little value. David resolved, however, to look about for himself, and, in a mound of sand thrown up by ants, he found a dozen or more, some of them a little larger than the ones in the pan. These he carefully picked out, and put in his match-box for safe keeping. \n \n Meanwhile, the work in the prospect-hole went steadily on. At a depth of two feet a small color was found, by[161] which time it was noon, and work ceased for an hour. By the middle of the afternoon the hole was three feet and a half deep, and solid rock was gained, though toward the last so much water entered that digging was difficult, and bailing had to be resorted to. At the bed-rock, where all their hopes rested, were found a few insignificant colors,—nothing more. \n \n Uncle Will, usually so cheerful, was quite downcast at this result. He had heard the rumors of gold from men whom he trusted, and was obliged to conclude that they had themselves been misled. Indeed, it seemed to be one of those instances in which a very small tale, by long travelling and frequent repetition, becomes strangely magnified and distorted. The Thirty-six had detached few men here because the story, as they had heard it, had located the wealth in a different place. Still there might be a good deal of gold on this creek, for a single hole is usually not enough to determine the character of a gulch. At least one more shaft must be sunk where the gravel was deeper, before all hope need be abandoned. Even if worst came to worst, there still remained the Alder Creek claims, and Lucky\u0027s nugget. \n \n It turned out that the other party, under Mr. Bradford, had met with even less success. Rubies they had found, but not a single color of gold. However, they had not reached bed-rock at the end of the first day. \n \n Uncle Will and his companions returned to the cabin[162] a few minutes before the others. Seated on the ground outside the door, they found an Indian family, consisting of an old bent squaw, two young women, and a thin, weak-looking young man. The old squaw, evidently the mother of the others, waved her arms in token of welcome as soon as she saw the white men. Then, touching the young man\u0027s breast she exclaimed, \"Him sick, you savvy?\" \n \n \"Sick, is he?\" repeated Uncle Will, looking at the pinched features and wasted frame. \n \n \"Sick—yis—you savvy [understand]?\" said the squaw. \n \n \"Consumption,\" said Uncle Will to David. \"It\u0027s very prevalent among the Indians, and carries off hundreds.\" Then turning to the old Indian woman he added, \"I savvy,—very bad, very sick. Have some tea?\" \n \n \"Tea! Yis, yis,\" answered she, eagerly, for tea is considered a great luxury by the Indians, and this family, dressed in ragged, cast-off clothing, seemed too abjectly poor to buy anything at the trading-post. Indeed, the only food they had was dried salmon, though the man carried an antiquated shot-gun. \n \n Uncle Will made some tea, and the natives drank it delightedly in the cabin, which they entered without invitation as soon as the door was opened. \n \n It must be explained here that the door was fastened[163] by a sliding pole which ran some distance along the inner side of one of the front logs, and was held in place by wooden pegs. The pole was shoved across the door by means of a knife-blade inserted from the outside between two logs at a crevice left for the purpose five feet from the door. In this manner the door had been locked that morning when the two parties set off. Doubtless the Indians had tried the door; but finding it secure, and seeing no means of opening it, they had not ventured to break in, but waited for the return of the miners. \n \n Both Uncle Will and Pennock realized the desirability of keeping the secret of the lock from the visitors, and this they attempted to do when the door was opened, Uncle Will attracting the attention of the Indians, while Pennock softly stole up to the crevice and pried back the bar. \n \n But though the natives did not see the door opened, they intended none the less to know how it was done, and that was why they so promptly entered the cabin with the others. However, the white men thought it best to say nothing, for it might be that they would drink their tea and go out without noticing the door. Pennock, who was a Colorado man and had no liking for the \"redskins,\" kept an eye on them from the moment of their entrance. \n \n The old squaw, after a quick inventory of the contents of the cabin, glanced furtively toward the door, and at[164] once discovered the long bar, but she did not know exactly how it was managed. So presently she shuffled unconcernedly up to the front of the cabin, and, turning about, faced the centre of the room. To all appearances, she was idly leaning against the logs, but both Pennock and David noticed that her hands behind her back were busily fumbling with the bar, and moving it cautiously back and forth. The \"game was up.\" Knowing the existence of the bar, and its height from the ground, she would easily discover from the outside the crevice through which it was controlled. \n \n \"The rascally old witch of an Injun!\" muttered Pennock through his teeth; but he knew it was of no use now to make a fuss. He broke out violently, however, when the visitors were gone and it was discovered that a nearly empty butter-can outside the house had disappeared with them. \n \n \"They\u0027re all sneak-thieves, every one of \u0027em,\" he declared angrily; \"and the worst of it is that the old squaw learned the secret of our lock. I saw her fumbling round. Now we\u0027ve got to leave somebody here every time we go away. I\u0027d just like to—!\" \n \n This sounded very much like the preface to a dire threat; but Mr. Bradford, who had arrived some minutes previously, interrupted it by observing that the Indians would not be likely to take food or clothing. \n \n \"No,\" said Uncle Will. \"They\u0027ll make off with[165] empty cans, or any little thing they think won\u0027t be missed, but they wouldn\u0027t take goods of value. That\u0027s too dangerous in this country. Besides, we\u0027ve treated them well, and they\u0027re pretty low-down creatures if they steal from us now.\" \n \n \"All the same,\" said Pennock, \"there was half an inch of good butter in that can, and I was intending to make a coffee cup of it as soon as it was empty. They\u0027re a shrewd lot, if they are dirty and ignorant. I hope they\u0027ve gone for good.\" \n \n It was a vain hope. A little later, a column of smoke half a mile up the trail northward showed that they had camped. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48539.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
