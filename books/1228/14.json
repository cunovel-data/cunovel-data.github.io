{"id":42065,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII DALTON\u0027S POST","content":"The storm continued all the next day, which was Sunday, and both parties remained in camp, the Bradfords according to their custom, and the others because of the weather. \n \n \"We stole a good march on them yesterday,\" said Uncle Will at breakfast, \"and I believe we shall come out ahead. While they are making their ten-mile cache and returning here, we can make a straight march and camp on the other side. We shall be just one day ahead of them then, and I think we can hold that lead. At the same time, we must not overtax the boys. I would rather lose all the gold in the universe than injure their health.\" \n \n The plan suggested by Uncle Will was carried out, and camp was pitched in due time among the straggling spruces beyond the pass. Nothing worth mention occurred on that march, save the discovery of a sulphur spring at a place called Mosquito Flats, and the shooting of several ptarmigan, from which was concocted a delicious stew with real dumplings and gravy. \n \n [113] \n \n Being far too tired after their long tramp to search for tent-poles and soft boughs in such an unpromising place, the boys decided not to raise their tent. Instead they laid it flat upon the snow, spread the blankets and down quilts upon it, and covered the whole with the rubber blanket. They turned in soon after supper, curling far under the coverlets, in which they arranged a small opening for breathing purposes, and slept warmly and well. What was their surprise, when they awoke, to find that snow had fallen during the night and covered them, so that the ptarmigan, seeing only a white mound, were clucking and calling almost within arm\u0027s reach. So tame were these birds that even when the boys jumped up and shook the snow from their bed, they only flew to a distance of twenty or thirty feet, where they paused to eye the strangers curiously. \n \n The Bradfords brought in their cache that day, in spite of violent snow-squalls which evidently prevented the Thirty-six from making their final dash across the summit. Thus they gained another day in the race. \n \n They were now at a place called Glacier Camp, near the headwaters of the Alsek River, which flows first to the north for fifty miles, then makes a great sweep to the west past Dalton\u0027s trading-post and the village of the Stiks, and finally, turning to the south, cuts the massive St. Elias Range, and enters the Pacific at Dry Bay. They were glad to take advantage of the smooth and[114] level surface of this river, with its alternate patches of ice and firm snow, but there were considerable stretches where, to avoid the windings of the stream, the trail took the shortest course through the woods, in spite of soft snow and the many irregularities of the ground. \n \n For a week they travelled in this manner through the varied scenery of the Alsek valley, now traversing wide plains, now passing sublime mountains and frowning cliffs, and meeting with sundry new experiences. On one occasion they enjoyed the novel sensation of feeling their high-piled sleds blown merrily over glare ice by a strong south wind. When this impetuous ally took hold, Roly longed for a pair of skates, that he might glide easily in front of his sled. As it was, his spiked ice-creepers dug in at every step, the sled was continually on his heels, and all the gliding he could do was in his imagination. \n \n David had imprudently neglected to wear his dark snow-glasses, and the sun being now high and the snow dazzling, he was attacked with snow-blindness,—a malady no doubt aggravated by the pungent smoke of the camp-fires. When he sat down to supper one evening, he found it difficult to keep his eyes open. Prickly pains darted through the eyeballs, and the vision was seriously impaired. On the following day he could hardly see to walk, in spite of the glasses which now—too late—he wore. Fortunately Mr. Bradford had included in the[115] medical stores an eye-wash for this painful affection, and after two or three days\u0027 treatment the inflammation subsided, and normal vision returned. \n \n Hardly a day passed in which the travellers succeeded in keeping entirely dry. To go to sleep in wet stockings was the customary thing; they were sure to dry during the night from the bodily warmth, and no one thought of taking cold. On one memorable march a damp, clinging snow fell in enormous flakes, which melted upon their coats, soaked through, and finally ran down into their shoes, and it required a roaring fire that night to restore the little company to a fair degree of comfort. \n \n None too soon they arrived at Dalton\u0027s Post, one hundred and twenty miles from the coast, for signs had not been wanting that the ice was about to go out of the streams. \n \n How novel it seemed to stand under a roof once more! How delightful to sit down in a chair beside a roaring stove and bid defiance to the elements! This little settlement, so far from anywhere in particular, was a very oasis of civilization. \n \n The storekeeper, Mr. Martin, usually called \"Ike,\" was a small, wiry man, whose black hair was sprinkled with gray. He was very glad to see the new-comers, and welcomed them hospitably, inquiring whence they came and what was the news in the outside world. For[116] months he had been the only white man at the trading-post, Jack Dalton, the owner, being absent on a journey to the coast. The advent of prospectors now and then was the only break in his monotonous existence. \n \n On entering the substantial log store, the boys surveyed the interior with interest. It was not unlike that of a country store at home, the shelves being piled high with calicoes and ginghams, shoes, hats, tin pans, plates, and cups, while from the roof-beams depended kettles, pails, steel traps, guns, and snow-shoes. Ike informed them that he kept a small stock of flour, bacon, rice, sugar, and other provisions, in a storehouse near at hand, and that the establishment traded principally with the Stik Indians, whose village lay nearly a mile down-stream to the west. The natives paid for the goods, either with money earned by packing on the trail, or with the skins of bears, foxes, and other fur-bearing animals. \n \n \"What do you charge for your goods?\" asked David, after his father and uncle had departed to select a camping-place. He had heard of the exorbitant prices of the Klondike. \n \n \"It depends a good deal on supply an\u0027 demand, same as anywhere else,\" answered Ike. \"But we commonly give the Indians a lower rate than white men. You see, the Indians are our regular customers, an\u0027 it\u0027s for our int\u0027rest to give them the preference. They have to depend on us entirely for many of the necessaries of[117] life, while white men should not come in here without bringing what they need. Just now we\u0027re running short o\u0027 flour,—wouldn\u0027t sell a fifty-pound sack to a white man for less than twenty-five dollars. There hain\u0027t been trade enough with whites up to this year to make it worth while to carry a big stock, for, as you probably know by this time, it\u0027s a hard job to get supplies over the summit.\" \n \n \"Have you heard about the big party behind us?\" asked Roly. \n \n \"Yes, Al King told me about them the other day, when he passed here.\" \n \n \"Will you sell provisions to them?\" asked David. \"They\u0027ve been on short rations right along.\" \n \n \"Not in large amounts. They must look out for themselves. If they should want a few sweets to munch on, we might let them have raisins at fifty cents a pound, or candy at one dollar.\" \n \n \"Candy?\" repeated Roly, eagerly. \"Just let me see some if you please, Mr. Martin.\" \n \n The storekeeper laughed, and produced a cheap, mixed grade,—the best he had, of which luxury the boys bought quite a quantity. \n \n While Roly was describing how the Thirty-six had been distanced on the summit, two Indian women entered and addressed the storekeeper in the native language, with which he seemed perfectly familiar. He rose, and going[118] behind the counter, weighed out some salt, answering meantime a number of questions which seemed to have reference to the boys, at whom the women glanced occasionally. \n \n \"They wanted to know all about you,\" said Ike, when his customers had gone. \"They belong to Lucky\u0027s family. Your uncle knows Lucky, don\u0027t he?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said David. \"Uncle Will took care of him when he was shot. Is he well again?\" \n \n \"Oh, yes! Off trapping now somewhere in the woods. He\u0027s a shrewd one, that Lucky. Brings in more furs than any other man in the tribe. He\u0027s a tall, wiry chap, with big cheek-bones an\u0027 little foxy eyes, an\u0027 the reg\u0027lar Indian virtues an\u0027 vices. He\u0027s brave, an\u0027 he\u0027s enduring, an\u0027 a splendid hunter, but he\u0027s sly an\u0027 lazy. Little Coffee Jack, his brother, is going to be just like him.\" \n \n \"There\u0027s Father calling us,\" said David, presently. \"They probably want water. Where do you get it, Mr. Martin?\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll find a hole cut in the river ice,\" answered the storekeeper, \"if you follow the path straight out from the door. You can\u0027t miss it. You want to be careful, though.\" \n \n Having procured kettles at the camp, the boys easily found the path, and the hole to which it led. So great was the combined thickness of snow and ice that the opening was about five feet deep, wide at the top, but narrowing toward the bottom. A sort of shelf or ledge[119] had been hacked out about half-way down, upon which the person drawing the water could stand, and as an additional safeguard a pole had been set horizontally across the hole. So rapid was the current that the water did not rise in the hole, but fairly flew beneath it. \n \n \"I don\u0027t wonder Mr. Martin told us to be careful,\" said David, with a shudder. \"One slip on that icy ledge, and down you\u0027d go into the dark water and under the ice in a jiffy.\" \n \n \"Just think,\" observed Roly, \"if Mr. Martin had ever fallen like that when he was here alone, no one would ever know what had become of him. The hole would soon get filled up, and his disappearance would be the kind of a mystery you read about. Probably the Indians would be suspected.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said David, \"I\u0027ve no doubt of it. But now let\u0027s get the water. You stand up here, and I\u0027ll do the dipping. You see,\" he added, concealing with an air of mock pride the real responsibility he felt, \"superior age makes it my duty to take the post of danger,\"—with which heroic burst he scrambled quickly but carefully down and filled the kettles without accident, though they were nearly jerked from his hands by the force of the current. It is safe to say, however, that had Uncle Will known the dangerous character of the water-hole, which only Long Peter had visited on his earlier trip, he would have fetched the water himself. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48533.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
