{"id":42061,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX KLUKWAN AND THE FORDS","content":"The boys had been too thoroughly fatigued to closely observe the settlement of Klukwan by the waning light of the afternoon, but in the morning they gazed with interest at the village across the Chilkat. The shore was lined with canoes of various sorts and sizes, and the river at this point was free from ice. They could hear the barking of dogs, and see men, women, and children moving about among the houses, which extended along the shore in a nearly straight line for a quarter of a mile. There were, perhaps, a score of buildings in all, most of them not unlike two-story New England farmhouses, neatly painted and well preserved. \"You would hardly believe that such a village contains no white inhabitants, would you?\" said Uncle Will, who, with Mr. Bradford, now joined the boys on the river-bank. \"No,\" replied David. \"How does it happen that the Indians own such good houses?\" \"I\u0027m told,\" said Uncle Will, \"that this was a Russian post before the United States bought Alaska in 1867. The Russian traders built the houses; and when the territory[70] was sold, they moved out and the Chilkats moved in. And not only are the Indians well housed, but, through the influence of the traders and missionaries, they have adopted the dress and, to a large extent, the manners of civilization. One of them even owns a horse and cart, which he drives across the flats, carrying on a kind of express business between Old Village—which is the meaning of the Indian word \u0027Klukwan\u0027—and Pyramid Harbor.\" Roly had been staring at a curious figure directly opposite. It appeared to represent the head and fore-legs of a frog, surrounded by a circle of black paint, the whole being portrayed upon several upright boards which stood side by side. \"What in the world is that thing?\" he asked, when his uncle had finished. \"It reminds me of the African dodger at the circus last summer. A colored man put his head through a hole in a sheet, and if you hit him you got a cigar,—and I did hit him, but the proprietor said I was too small to smoke, so he gave me a stick of candy.\" The others laughed, and David proposed that Roly should throw a snowball at the frog, and see what he would get. \"That would hardly do,\" said Uncle Will, \"even if he could throw so far, for this is no African dodger, but a totem-figure, similar to those on the totem-poles.[71] The ashes of some Indian of the family which has the frog as its symbol are entombed in a little house behind those boards, and Roly would be more likely to get a bullet than a stick of candy if he injured that image.\" On turning back from the river-bank, they found Long Peter looking intently at a group of people a short distance to the north. \"White people—two men—two women!\" he exclaimed, as they approached. \"Women?\" repeated Mr. Bradford, incredulously; \"this is a queer place for white women.\" \"So it is,\" said Uncle Will. \"They must have come from that disabled steamer, bound for Copper River, which landed her passengers at Pyramid Harbor a fortnight ago. I met a few of her people on this trail when I came out to the coast, but didn\u0027t see this party. They must have camped off the regular trail, and have evidently travelled very slowly. I think they are on this side of the Salmon River, which empties into the Chilkat opposite the north end of the village.\" Uncle Will\u0027s theory proved the true one. The Bradfords, having made everything ready for the day\u0027s march, soon covered the short distance which separated them from the party ahead, which consisted of two young men, a tall and rather slender young woman, and a matronly person whom they at first supposed to be the mother of the others. After pleasantly greeting the[72] new-comers, however, and noting their expression of surprise and interest, the elder woman took it upon herself to offer an explanation. \"I don\u0027t wonder, gentlemen,\" said she, \"that you are surprised to see ladies in such a place as this, though I do not doubt there are many on the more frequented trails. We were bound for Copper River; but our steamer proved unseaworthy, and was obliged to land her passengers at Pyramid Harbor. There were rumors of gold on this trail, so we determined to reach the spot if possible.\" \"I admire your pluck, madam,\" said Uncle Will, gallantly. \"But wasn\u0027t it a rather rash undertaking?\" suggested Mr. Bradford. \"Yes, I admit it was. In fact, we didn\u0027t let our friends and neighbors back in Ohio know what we intended; because if we had, and then failed, we should be the laughing-stock of our town. All our friends thought we were making a pleasure trip to the Pacific coast.\" \"Well, well!\" exclaimed Mr. Bradford. \"And this is a family party, then?\" and he wondered what his wife would think of making such a trip. \"Yes, practically so. I am Mrs. Shirley. These are my nephews and my niece.\" \"And we are all Bradfords, except the Indian,\" said Mr. Bradford, in return for this information. [73] \"But how in the world do you manage to move your supplies with only two men and no Indians or dogs?\" asked Uncle Will. \"Oh, my niece and I help with the sleds. We have to make a good many trips, though, over the same ground, for we have a year\u0027s provisions with us. It is very slow work, especially since one of the boys is quite disabled. He cut his foot badly with an axe a few days ago.\" Uncle Will looked at the bandaged foot, and asked if it had been properly cared for. \"Yes,\" replied the young man, \"thanks to my aunt.\" \"Very fortunately,\" said that lady, \"I am a physician, and so was able to dress the wound. There was a medical man with a large party which recently passed, who offered his services, but they were not needed.\" \"And how do you expect to cross this wide river?\" asked Mr. Bradford. \"Oh, my uninjured nephew has been carrying the goods over piece-meal. It is simply a matter of time and perseverance. Three days ago, we had stopped at the first of those shallow streams which you must have passed yesterday, when we were overtaken by that numerous company of white men and Indians. They made light work of the fording, carrying their sleds over bodily, loads and all, as many men taking hold as could find room; and when their own loads were across, they generously[74] came back for ours. Finally a big, strong man whom they called Paul, took my niece, my injured nephew, and myself over on his back, one after another,—and they did the same thing for us at the other streams that day; but before we reached this river they were out of sight.\" \"Well,\" said Uncle Will, \"we mustn\u0027t let them outdo us. It\u0027s surely our turn now, and we shall be very glad to help you, madam.\" \"Thank you,\" replied Mrs. Shirley, gratefully. \"I am very unwilling to cause you extra labor and delay, but in our present unfortunate situation I can not refuse assistance.\" Preparations were at once begun for crossing Salmon River. The Bradfords took from each of their long sleds half its load. Then Long Peter, facing forward, firmly grasped the front of his sled, while Mr. Bradford and Uncle Will, one on each side, held to the ends of a shovel thrust under the forward part above the runners. David and Roly took the ends of another shovel similarly placed under the rear end, and the only able-bodied man of the other party, who insisted on doing his share, grasped the sled from behind. In this manner they lifted their load, and started down the snowy bank into the water, which was shallow at first, but grew deeper as they neared the opposite shore. It was quite necessary that all should keep step, but as they entered the deeper[75] water David and Roly found it difficult to do this, for the current was very strong, and almost forced their feet from beneath them. The icy water surged and bubbled higher and higher against their rubber boots,—a fact which the boys noticed with some dismay. At length they entered the lowest part of the channel, where the depth of the stream was about two feet and a half. \"There!\" exclaimed Roly, ruefully, as he took a step forward and braced himself as well as he could against the current, \"the water came into my boots that time. There it goes again. O-o-h! but it\u0027s cold.\" \"Aren\u0027t you glad you came?\" said David, provokingly. \"Y-yes,\" stoutly stammered Roly, who saw that his brother was also wet, and resolved that he, too, would make light of the wetting. \"But I didn\u0027t expect ice-water bathing.\" A moment more and they were out of the river and up on the further bank, where they set down the sled and paused to recover their breath. The men, being taller and wearing higher boots, had escaped dry-shod, but the boys felt anything but comfortable. \"Never mind the water, boys,\" said Uncle Will, cheerfully. \"It won\u0027t hurt you to get wet in this country. Pour the water out of your boots, if there\u0027s much in them, for you needn\u0027t go back again. Just stay right here and load up the sleds as fast as we bring them over.\" The men swished back through the water, carrying the[76] empty sled for the other half of its load. In half an hour all the supplies of both parties had been brought across. \"Now, Mrs. Shirley,\" said Uncle Will, with a smile, \"have you any preference as to the manner of transportation? I trust I\u0027m as strong as the kind-hearted Paul.\" \"I\u0027ve no doubt of that,\" replied Mrs. Shirley, with a slight trace of embarrassment. \"But really, if another way could be found, I should prefer it. You have an unloaded sled on the other side,—could you not take us over on that?\" \"Yes,\" said Uncle Will, \"we can.\" The sled was promptly sent for, and upon its arrival Mrs. Shirley requested her niece to go first. The young woman accordingly seated herself upon it, grasped the sides firmly, and was borne lightly over the river by the four men. Her brother went next, and finally her aunt. The two parties remained together all that day, as there were other channels to be crossed, and a few miles farther a second great river, the Klaheena, also flowing into the Chilkat from the west. It was nightfall before the fording was completed and the way lay clear before them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48529.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
