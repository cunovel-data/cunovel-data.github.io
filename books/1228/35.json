{"id":42086,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIV RAIDED BY A WOLF","content":"The third evening after the departure of the captain\u0027s party David was sitting in the cook-tent watching the last embers of the sunset and the varying lights and shadows on the river. Shep stood near the edge of the bluff. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly the dog\u0027s ears pointed forward attentively and his whole body quivered. It was clear that something unusual had come in sight. No sooner had David reached the brow of the bluff than he saw the cause of Shep\u0027s excitement. A black animal was lapping the water where the river curved to the northwest, about three hundred feet distant. \\n\\n \\n\\n The semi-darkness and the heavy mosquito net over his face prevented David from seeing clearly, but he instantly formed the conclusion that it was a dog belonging to some pack train on the neighboring trail, and whistled to see what it would do. \\n\\n \\n\\n On hearing the whistle the animal raised its head, gazed a moment at the two figures on the bluff, resumed its drinking, and then, having satisfied its thirst, turned and started up the slope. As it did so, David was conscious[280] that it had a slinking gait unlike that of a dog, and for the first time he thought how queer it was that Shep had not offered to run down and make friends with the stranger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a small black bear,\" flashed into his mind. Instantly he ran with all speed to the cabin for the shot-gun, which he kept loaded with buckshot. The captain\u0027s party had carried off the only rifle, and David was now sorry he had not brought his own. He caught up the shot-gun, however, and slipping a few extra cartridges into his pocket, ran back to the bluff where Shep stood guard. \\n\\n \\n\\n The strange animal had disappeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment David was disconcerted. He had not thought the bear could get away so quickly, nor could he be sure whether it had gone into the fringe of trees and bushes along the river-bank or continued up the slope. He hesitated, too, before setting out to attack such an animal with only a shot-gun for a weapon and a dog of doubtful courage as an ally. The next instant, however, he had decided to track and kill the beast if possible, and calling Shep to follow, he hurried down to the river\u0027s sandy brink to examine the tracks by the waning light. He was quite puzzled at finding that they were almost identical in appearance with those made by Shep, but at length the truth dawned upon him. He had to deal, not with a young bear, but with a full-grown wolf! \\n\\n \\n\\n [281] \\n\\n \\n\\n He now endeavored to make Shep take the scent, but Shep was not trained to such work and sniffed around indiscriminately without attempting to follow the animal\u0027s trail. There was nothing for it but to track the wolf himself. He accordingly traced every track as far as it would lead him. One proceeded from the fringe of bushes to the point where the animal drank, while another led straight up the face of the bluff. The latter he followed as far as the sand continued; but the top of the elevation was grassy, and in the growing darkness the trail was quickly lost. Keeping his eyes and ears alert for the slightest sound, David penetrated some distance into the open woods, but without discovering further signs of the animal. Satisfied that nothing more could be done, he returned to camp, and took unusual pains to fasten the frail cabin door securely when he turned in for the night. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nor was he destined to sleep without an alarm. A noise of rattling tin awoke him with a start. The interior of the cabin was quite dark, since, as we have said, there were no windows; but the nights were not yet without some light, and feeble rays outlined every chink as David sat up, threw off his mosquito net, and looked around. Again came the rattle of tin. It evidently proceeded from a pile of empty cans just outside the cabin. He brought himself to a kneeling posture and pressed his face close to one of the widest[282] chinks. Presently he distinguished an animal nosing among the cans and making the noise which had awakened him. It was Shep. David spoke to the dog, and having seen him walk away with a somewhat shame-faced air, he settled himself once more among the blankets and was soon asleep again. \\n\\n \\n\\n Seven days had passed when the monotony of his existence was broken by the arrival of strangers. It was in the afternoon that he heard voices and the sound of horses from the direction of the trail, and a minute later saw two young fellows ride up, followed by a dozen pack animals. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello!\" exclaimed the foremost rider as he saw David, \"this place has changed hands, I guess, since we was here last. How d\u0027you do? Hovey and Herrick gone away?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" answered David. \"They left for the Kah Sha River a week ago. You\u0027ve been here before?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes! We\u0027re packing back and forth between Pyramid Harbor and Five Finger Rapids for the owner of these horses. We always like to put up here for the night, for it\u0027s pretty lonesome on this trail.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s so,\" said David, feelingly. He, too, was not a little pleased at the thought of company, and the more so in the present instance, because the new-comers were near his own age. The elder was slender, with dark hair and a rather sparse growth of beard, and might[283] have been twenty-two or three, while the other was a ruddy, plump lad of about seventeen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My name\u0027s Close,\" said the dark-haired one, as he dismounted and proceeded to unsaddle his horse. \"We\u0027re from Wisconsin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In return for this information David gave his own name and residence. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Wisconsin boys took the packs from their horses and turned them loose to graze. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now for supper,\" said Close. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll find a stove and dishes and a table, such as it is, in the cook-tent yonder,\" said David, hospitably. \"I guess you know your way around. Just make yourselves at home, and I\u0027ll have the fire going in a jiffy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It took the strangers but a short time to cook their evening meal, and as soon as they had finished with the stove David prepared his own supper, and the three sat down together. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can you spare us enough butter for our bread?\" asked Close. \"We\u0027re all out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said David, passing it over, \"help yourself.\" He knew there were but two more cans in the cache under his charge, but he felt certain the captain would wish him to extend such hospitalities as lay in his power; and he would much rather have gone without butter himself for a time than deny it to his guests.[284] They, however, had no intention of trenching on David\u0027s slender stock without returning an equivalent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t seem to have any condensed milk,\" observed the younger of the two. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said David. \"There isn\u0027t a drop. I\u0027ve looked the whole cache over for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, here! You just take what you want out of our can. We\u0027ve got milk if we haven\u0027t got butter. Try some of that dried fruit, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Having thanked his friends, David inquired if the trail was in good shape. He was thinking that before long he would be tramping back over it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" answered Close, \"most of it\u0027s good; but there\u0027s some bad bogs where the horses get mired. Those cattle herds have cut it all to pieces where the ground is soft. We haven\u0027t had much trouble, though.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" put in his companion, \"when we get started we can go along well enough. The worst of this packing business is ketching the horses in the morning. The critters are as sly as foxes. They\u0027ll stand so still in the thickets when they hear you coming that you can go within ten feet of \u0027em and never know they\u0027re there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They keep pretty well together, though,\" said the other, \"and the tracks are generally plain. Besides, there\u0027s a bell on one of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If they were my horses,\" declared David, \"I would bell them all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [285] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And it wouldn\u0027t be a bad idea,\" said Close, with a laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n By David\u0027s invitation the Wisconsin boys slept that night on the bedstead in the tent. They breakfasted early and then set out to round up their horses, which they accomplished in a couple of hours after a long tramp through the woods. Having loaded the animals, they bade David good-by and rode away toward the trail, presently shouting back, \"Better call the dog; he\u0027s following the horses.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n David whistled Shep back and ordered him to lie down. It was no wonder he thought every one his master, he had changed owners so often. He now lay down quietly enough on the ground before the cook-tent and appeared to have forgotten all about the pack train. \\n\\n \\n\\n An hour later David finished his wood-chopping and suddenly noticed that Shep was gone. At first he thought little of the matter, supposing him to be somewhere in the neighborhood, but when another hour passed without him, he feared Shep had followed the horses, after all. He whistled again and again, but no dog came; and now he was perplexed to know what to do. By this time the pack train was six or eight miles away. The dog would overtake it easily, but he could not hope to do so before it halted for the night; and he did not like to leave so long the property of which he was in[286] charge. The Wisconsin boys might send the dog back, or, failing in that, they would doubtless deliver him up to the captain, whom they would probably see before many days. So, however much he regretted the loss of his only companion, he concluded to let the matter drop. \\n\\n \\n\\n A little later, from the sand-ridge back of the tents, he perceived a column of white smoke above the trees near the river, a quarter of a mile to the southeast. It indicated the presence of either white men or Indians on the trail, and Shep might be with them. David lost no time in locking the cabin door and setting out rapidly in the direction of the smoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n On his hunting excursions he had noticed an Indian canoe bottom-up near that spot, and naturally supposed that the dusky owners had now arrived. He found, however, that two white men had kindled a fire against a fallen tree for the purpose of cooking their midday meal. Their two horses were grazing near by. The strangers were men of middle age, with thick, grizzled beards and sunbrowned faces. They seemed surprised to see David, but greeted him pleasantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Camping near here?\" they asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" answered David, seating himself sociably; \"at Champlain\u0027s Landing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes!\" exclaimed one of the men, \"I saw the sign-board on the tree where your path turns off, but I didn\u0027t know any one was there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [287] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you come from Dawson?\" asked David. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; we left there nine days ago.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Any new strikes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, none recently; but the people keep swarming in over the other trails.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are they paying in wages?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Seven to ten dollars a day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard it was very unhealthy there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, there\u0027s a good deal of scurvy and pneumonia.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Any starvation last winter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, but it was a tight squeeze for some of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does a man stand much chance of a fortune who goes there now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not if he expects to dig gold. The paying ground is all taken up and a good deal more. There\u0027s a better chance now in trading. In fact, that\u0027s what my partner and I are going into. We\u0027ve discovered that some things are mighty scarce in Dawson, and people will pay almost anything for them, so we\u0027re going out to the coast to bring in a stock of goods. We shall try to be back before cold weather.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n David had kept his eyes open for Shep, but seeing nothing of him, he asked if they had met two young fellows that morning and had noticed a black and white dog. The men remembered the pack train well enough, but neither had any recollection of seeing the dog. So David went back to the Landing more mystified than ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n [288] \\n\\n \\n\\n With Shep away, he felt instinctively that the wolf would pay him another visit; nor was he mistaken. That night he slept deeply and heard no sound, but when he arose and went out to the cook-tent, he rubbed his eyes in astonishment. Wolf-tracks were everywhere, dishes were scattered about, a five-pound piece of bacon had disappeared, and the butter can, which had stood in a pail of water on the top of the rude sideboard five feet above the ground now lay on the grass, where the wolf had ineffectually tried to get at the contents. Strange to say, the pail from which the can had been abstracted stood unmoved in its accustomed place. \\n\\n \\n\\n David picked up the scattered utensils and smiled rather grimly to think how he had slept for two nights in the open, unprotected tent, exposed to this midnight prowler. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48554.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
