{"id":42080,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII THE PLAGUE OF MOSQUITOES","content":"Having learned that he would find upon a tree near Klukshu Lake directions for following the new trail to Shorty Creek, as the district was popularly called, Mr. Bradford determined to return by the Dalton trail to the lake, as the relief party of the Thirty-six had done. Here and there along the way they saw traces of the winter\u0027s travel. Broken sleds and gee-poles, stumps of trees, and the ashes of camp-fires recalled the memory of labors amid the ice and snow which now, in the heat of summer, seemed like a dream. \n \n Up to this time the mosquitoes had been rather large, but neither numerous nor aggressive. But now on a sudden came myriads of small ones, evidently a new crop, voracious, persistent, overwhelming. They swarmed up from every marsh until their combined singing made a continuous murmur in the trees, and the travellers, who were without head-nets, were forced to protect their necks with handkerchiefs, and their faces with small branches, which they must needs wave to and fro incessantly. \n \n [232] \n \n Camp was pitched near the Klukshu River, where two ancient and abandoned Indian houses stood, in a level valley mostly free from trees. The low bushes in the neighborhood allowed the breeze free play, and it was hoped that here the mosquitoes would be less numerous. There was no getting away from them entirely, however, and a fire was speedily built in order that the smoke might aid in discouraging the pests. \n \n The two houses, which they had noticed as they passed in April, were constructed of hewn boards gray with age. Such a wealth of ready fuel in a spot so poor in timber had proved irresistible alike to prospectors and Indians, and the entire roof of one hut and much of the roof of the other had gone up in camp-fire smoke. Mr. Bradford was averse, however, to further despoiling either structure, and directed Roly and Coffee Jack to gather up only such loose boards and odd pieces as were lying about on the ground. \n \n While roasting several red squirrels brought down with a revolver, they were startled by a sudden snort in the bushes near by, followed by a crackling of twigs as some heavy animal made off precipitately. The three jumped to their feet and searched through the thicket in that direction, but could see nothing of the beast which had caused the alarm. There could be little doubt, however, that it was a bear. \n \n \"If we\u0027re going to have visitors of that kind,\" said[233] Mr. Bradford, as he returned his revolver to his belt, \"we\u0027ll pitch the tent in one of the houses. I don\u0027t anticipate any trouble, but bears are brimful of curiosity, and it\u0027s just as well to put ourselves and our belongings out of their reach.\" \n \n This suggestion pleased Roly, whose imagination, boylike, seized eagerly upon the idea of converting the better of the two houses into a fort and barricading it against the enemy. He collected an abundance of soft shrubbery and spread it upon the floor of the hut, while Mr. Bradford, keeping a sharp lookout for the unwelcome prowler, cut some tent-poles on a distant hillside. \n \n When all was ready, the tent was set up within the hut, and, being mosquito-proof, it promised a complete refuge from at least one foe. A sufficient number of boards was now appropriated from the other cabin to cover the portion of the roof above the tent. Then the packs were brought in, and finally Roly arranged a door of boards. This done, the fort was declared impregnable, and the tired travellers turned in, well assured of complete security. \n \n Coffee Jack had brought no tent, and as there was no extra space in that of his companions, he rolled himself in his blanket, head and all, till he seemed to invite suffocation, and lay down on a bed of leaves in a corner of the cabin, where he slept comfortably[234] enough, except that his breathing was heavy and labored for lack of air. \n \n The mosquitoes were even more numerous next day, and the travellers were obliged to keep in motion. Flowers were springing up on every side. There were strawberry blossoms, which awakened great hopes. There were violets and forget-me-nots and yarrow, and almost touching elbows with the flowers of spring flamed the autumnal golden-rod, so brief in that high latitude was the season of warmth. \n \n The Indian boy pointed out with delight a large-leaved plant with a hollow, juicy stalk, which grew abundantly in shady places, exclaiming, \"Muck-muck! Good! Make strong!\" Seeing him eagerly stripping the stringy fibres from the stalks and eating the soft inner part, Mr. Bradford and Roly followed his example, and found that the flavor was of a medicinal sort, but sweet and not unpleasant. The leaves were shaped somewhat like those of a maple tree, but were of lighter green. Coffee Jack could give no name to the plant. \n \n \"Its flavor reminds me a little of celery,\" said Roly. \n \n \"Yes,\" said Mr. Bradford; \"but in some respects the plant more resembles rhubarb, and as that is, I believe, a native of Asia, this may be a variety which has crossed Behring Strait. If the taste were sour, I should be pretty certain of it.\" \n \n [235] \n \n Camped at the foot of Klukshu Lake on a pleasant knoll east of the river, they found Reitz and Johnson, two of their friends of Pennock\u0027s Post. Reitz said they were stationed there to catch salmon for the main party on the Kah Sha River, and from what they could learn from the natives the fish ought to come up-stream very soon. \n \n A family of Indians were quartered on the low ground west of the river near the cabin in which the wounded Lucky had been left in the winter. They also were awaiting the salmon, which constitutes the chief food of the Alaskan tribes. \n \n \"How would you like to spend a week with us, Roly?\" asked Reitz, as the three were about to continue their journey. \"You enjoy fishing, don\u0027t you?\" \n \n Roly answered that he would like to stay very well, and his father readily consented. \"You can take this tent,\" said the latter. \"It\u0027s only ten miles to Moran\u0027s Camp, and I guess you can find your way there when the week\u0027s up.\" \n \n \"Oh, yes!\" declared Roly, without hesitation. \"I\u0027ll get along all right.\" He added, as he counted a score of mosquitoes killed at one slap, \"If you get a chance to send my head-net down, I guess I can use it.\" \n \n \"We\u0027ll try to,\" said Mr. Bradford, as he and the Indian boy re-crossed the river on a mass of débris. \n \n No sooner had Coffee Jack exchanged a few words[236] with the Indian family than he fell into a fit of the sulks. He cast more than one fond glance at a little Indian girl of about his own age, and Mr. Bradford heard the father of the family repeat the word \"potlash\" several times. As this term signifies a feast, it was clear that Coffee Jack had been invited to dine. \n \n Mr. Bradford had determined to push on a few miles in order to reach the Kah Sha gorge early next morning before the time of high water. But when he undertook to find the trail, which was here invisible across a level deposit of small stones, he found himself baffled. \n \n \"Where\u0027s the Shorty Creek trail, Coffee Jack?\" he asked. \n \n \"Shorty Kick t\u0027ail?\" said Coffee, with well-feigned innocence. \"I dunno.\" \n \n Now, Coffee Jack had been uniformly treated with kindness, and was certain to be so long as he deserved it, but when he said, \"I dunno,\" Mr. Bradford had every reason to think he was stretching the truth and presuming upon his own good-nature. In view of the falsehood he resolved to teach the boy his duty. It would never do to let him override the will of his employer. \n \n \"You don\u0027t know?\" repeated Mr. Bradford, with the frown and voice of a thunder-cloud. \"Tell me where that trail is, quick!\" \n \n [237] \n \n As he said this, he raised his stick so threateningly over Coffee Jack\u0027s head that the boy, fearing instant annihilation, produced the information with incredible speed. \n \n \"Shorty Kick t\u0027ail there,\" said he, pointing to the edge of a grove of great balm-of-Gilead trees, to which he led the way without another word. \n \n At the first stream, perhaps two miles beyond, Coffee Jack declared that there was no more water for five miles. He had evidently obtained information regarding the new trail from the Indian at the foot of the lake, and as Mr. Bradford did not believe the lad would lie again, he halted for the night. The white man all the while had a tender place in his heart for the young Indian lover, and when the boy asked permission to go back, he readily gave it. So Coffee Jack, delighted, ran swiftly down the trail toward the dusky little maiden and the \"potlash.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48548.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
