{"id":42063,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XI THE MYSTERIOUS THIRTY-SIX","content":"For nearly a week, the little party struggled with the most difficult portion of the trail. At Pleasant Camp they had reached an elevation of about five hundred feet above the sea, but the rise had been so gradual through the forty-five miles of river valleys that it had hardly been noticed. From that point, however, it was all mountain work, and they had to ascend three thousand feet more in about fifteen miles, to gain the summit of the Chilkat Pass and the high interior plateau. The trail often led uphill only to lead provokingly down again on the other side, so that the gain was thrown away, and had to be earned all over again. Then, too, the snowdrifts increased the roughness of the path. It was out of the question to move full loads under such conditions, and half-loads were taken forward a few miles and cached one day, and the remainder brought up the next. Some of the slopes were so steep that even the ice-creepers barely gave the sled-pullers a foothold, and often the sheer weight of the loads dragged them back again and again. \\n\\n \\n\\n A Curious Phenomenon beside the Trail \\n\\n \\n\\n [89] \\n\\n \\n\\n Under this terrible strain their feet grew sore, and the frequent dipping of the gee-poles, as the sleds dove into the hollows, gave them cruelly lame backs. To make matters worse, the tugging on the ropes, coupled with the usual dampness of their mittens, caused the skin of their fingers to crack deeply and painfully at the joints. Many times the sleds overturned, or jammed against stumps and roots. Altogether it was a severe and thorough training for the boys in patience, endurance, and perseverance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What will become of Mrs. Shirley\u0027s party here, I wonder,\" said Roly, after a hard day\u0027s work. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If they are wise,\" replied Uncle Will, \"they\u0027ll stop at Pleasant Camp. The two young men can make a dash in for claims when the lame one has recovered, but those ladies can never stand this kind of work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n David declared that never before had he appreciated the picture in his room at home, of Napoleon\u0027s soldiers dragging cannon over the Alps. He was quite sure he would groan with genuine sympathy when he saw it again. In the mean time, in spite of all discomforts, he was daily securing beautiful and interesting views of mountains and valleys, of camps and the sledding, and of all the unique phases of his outdoor life. \\n\\n \\n\\n At one point, he photographed a curious phenomenon beside the trail. The stump of a tree bore upon its top a great skull-shaped mass of snow, while underneath on[90] every side the flakes had been packed against the bark by the wind, the whole forming a colossal figure of a human head and neck, which appeared as if carved in purest marble. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now and then they observed traces of the company ahead. Sometimes it was a broken gee-pole, again a deserted camping-ground or fireplace, and frequently bits of rope, empty cracker boxes and tins, or a freshly \"blazed\" or notched tree to indicate the trail. But the Thirty-six themselves were as elusive as if they all wore seven-league boots, and the Bradfords never caught sight of them during these days, no matter how hard they worked. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the forest through which they were travelling, spruce gum of fine quality could be picked from many of the trees, and the boys found it useful as a preventive of thirst in a country where open springs were far between. Often, too, they carried beef tablets in their pockets, and these served to alleviate hunger as well as thirst,â€”for so severe was the work, and so stimulating to the appetite the mountain air, that they were fairly faint between meals. \\n\\n \\n\\n Once, while on the march, they were startled by a deep rumbling, which seemed to come from the bowels of the earth. Uncle Will said that this was the sound of an avalanche on the high mountains across the Klaheena valley. \\n\\n \\n\\n [91] \\n\\n \\n\\n Porcupines were so numerous as to be obtainable as often as needed, but Roly one day discovered a new kind of game. He espied a large dark bird sitting on a low branch of a spruce near the trail, and called Uncle Will\u0027s attention to it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah!\" exclaimed the latter, \"that\u0027s a spruce partridge, and very good eating. Is your revolver loaded, Charles?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The guns were packed in their cases on the sleds, but Mr. Bradford\u0027s revolver was loaded and ready. He took careful aim at the partridge and fired. The bird, not thirty feet away, merely cocked its head to one side, and calmly eyed the discomfited marksman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Missed,\" said Mr. Bradford. \"Suppose you try a shot, Roly. I\u0027ve been out of practice too long.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Roly, \"let me try. But why didn\u0027t the partridge fly away? They\u0027re awfully \u0027scary\u0027 at home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is not the ruffed grouse, or partridge, of New England,\" explained his father, \"but a different species. It is often called the \u0027fool hen,\u0027 because it is so stupid. You might fire a dozen times without inducing it to fly, and you can go up quite close to it if you wish. It\u0027s more sportsmanlike, though, to give the bird a chance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Roly accordingly stood where he was, fired, and missed. Uncle Will then brought down the bird with his revolver, and later, David and Roly plucked and dressed it, with[92] some assistance from Long Peter, and cooked it for their supper. \\n\\n \\n\\n David awoke, one morning, to find his younger brother observing him with a curious expression in his eyes, the cause of which he was at a loss to discover. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What in the world is the matter with your face, Dave?\" said Roly, as soon as he saw that his tent-mate was awake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Matter with my face?\" repeated David, sleepily. \"Why, nothing. What makes you think so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t look a bit natural,\" said Roly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, come!\" muttered David. \"What are you talking about? I\u0027m all right, I tell you;\" and he gazed drowsily up at the canvas above him, through which the morning light filtered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! you are, are you?\" said Roly. \"Well, I advise you to look in a mirror before you go outside, that\u0027s all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But David neglected the warning. His appearance, when he crawled forth from the tent, was the signal for a loud burst of laughter from Long Peter, who was making the fire, and this, more than anything else, convinced the boy that something was really wrong. He retreated into the tent and consulted a small pocket looking-glass, whereby he discovered that his countenance was as black as the ace of spades. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"April Fool!\" shouted the irrepressible Roly, with great glee, and dived head-first out of the tent to escape a flying shoe. \"My dear brother, permit me to inform you that this is the First of April.\" This last explanatory speech was delivered with telling effect from a safe distance. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Camp of the Mysterious Thirty-Six \\n\\n \\n\\n [93] \\n\\n \\n\\n David was at first much vexed, but having washed his face, he joined at last in the laugh against himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n Taking the idea from the blackened faces of the Indian women, Roly had carefully gone over his sleeping brother\u0027s face with soot from the bottom of a kettle. The youngster confessed, however, that, owing to anxiety lest David should awaken first, his fun had cost him half his night\u0027s sleep. It brought upon him, too, some words of counsel from his father, who reminded him that practical joking often provoked serious ill-feeling, and it was only owing to David\u0027s good sense that it had not done so in the present instance. \\n\\n \\n\\n That day\u0027s march was a short one. Early in the afternoon they saw a thin blue column of smoke rising through the trees ahead, and a few minutes later, to their unbounded delight, they entered the camp of the Mysterious Thirty-six, whose tents were scattered through the grove wherever the snow was level, or a tree or bank afforded shelter. Such members of the company as they saw greeted them pleasantly, and congratulated Uncle Will on making so rapid a journey. They could far better afford to be distanced by the small Bradford party than the Bradfords by them, and showed no trace of ill-humor.[94] Uncle Will declared, however, as the Bradfords were pitching their camp in the edge of the timber, that it was too early to crow yet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What place is this?\" asked Roly, as he fetched a kettleful of water from the one open spot in a brook everywhere else buried deep under the snow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Uncle Will hung the kettle over the fire and answered, \"Rainy Hollow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah!\" exclaimed the boy, with sudden recollection, \"this is where you wrote your letter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said his uncle, \"and the place was well named. It storms here most of the time, consequently the crossing of the summit is usually difficult and often quite dangerous. We are close to the summit now, and this is the last of the timber.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And how far is it across the summit?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About twenty miles to the timber on the other side.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n After supper the boys paid a visit to the large camp, having a desire to see how the Mysterious Thirty-six looked and lived. As they entered the camp the familiar \"Muck-muck\" was shouted from the entrance of a large cooking-tent by a jolly, red-faced man, whose general appearance, together with a big spoon which he waved dramatically above a kettle of beans, indicated that he was the cook. The call was taken up in various directions, and repeated to the farthest tents, and presently white men and Indians appeared from every side and[95] took their places indiscriminately in a line before the tent. Each carried an aluminum plate and cup, with knife, fork, and spoon. As fast as they were served, the men either seated themselves on logs and boxes, or stood in groups, eating their beans, bacon, and biscuits, and drinking their hot tea with great relish. The boys saw several sly young Indians finish their rations almost at a gulp, lick their plates clean, and immediately re-enter the line, by which trick they received a double portion, the cook being evidently unable to distinguish them from new-comers. \\n\\n \\n\\n When all had been served, a white man approached the tent and asked, \"Do we get a second helping to-night, Jack? I\u0027m as hungry as I was before. Appetite\u0027s just getting whetted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, Si, my boy, there\u0027s nothing left. Only one round,â€”that\u0027s the orders to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H-m,\" said Si. \"I\u0027ll bet those Indians didn\u0027t go hungry, though. I saw one of \u0027em go back into the line.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said the cook, \"the Cap\u0027n will have to see to it, then. I can\u0027t watch \u0027em all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose not,\" said Si. \"It\u0027s a shame, though.\" He looked around to satisfy himself that the leader was not within hearing. \"I\u0027d have pitched that Indian into a snowbank if it wasn\u0027t directly against orders. The Cap\u0027n says we\u0027re to have no rows with the redskins, or[96] they\u0027ll leave us, so we\u0027ve got to be sweet an\u0027 nice to the rascals. By the way, Jack, has anybody spoken for that kettle?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re first on that,\" replied the cook, handing out one of the bean kettles, in the bottom of which clung some half-burned scrapings. \"Get all the satisfaction you can out of it, old man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Trust me for that,\" said Si, calling to a friend to come and share his prize. \\n\\n \\n\\n Several others came up to ask for a second helping, but they were disappointed,â€”all except the one who followed Si. He received the other bean kettle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad we don\u0027t have to figure so closely,\" said David. \"It must be pretty tough to go to bed hungry after a hard day\u0027s work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s what it is!\" exclaimed a young man who stood near, and overheard David\u0027s remark. \"If they doubled our present rations it wouldn\u0027t be too much, considering the work we have to do in these mountains. I\u0027ve had only two really satisfying meals since we left Pyramid Harbor, and those consisted of porcupine stew.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t they give you more, then?\" asked Roly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! I suppose it\u0027s because we can\u0027t carry much food on these sleds, and what we have must last until June, when pack trains of horses can bring us more. Would you boys like to look around the camp?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, indeed,\" answered David. \\n\\n \\n\\n [97] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said their guide, who, as they learned, came from their own State, \"let\u0027s have a look at the fireplace.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was near the cook-tent, and consisted of a circular hollow at the foot of a tall spruce. At the bottom of the cavity a bright fire blazed, and several kettles were hung over it by forked sticks suspended from a horizontal pole, which was supported at each end at the proper height by a crotched stake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There was quite a hole here when we came,\" said the young man, \"and we enlarged it with our shovels, and deepened it until we reached the ground. The heat of the fire has made it still larger. You can get a good idea of the depth of the snow from this hole, for, as you see, the head of the man who stands in there by the fire doesn\u0027t reach within a foot of the surface. There\u0027s about twice as much snow here as there was in the valley.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They next visited the dwelling tents, which were exactly like the diminutive tent of David and Roly, each barely accommodating two men; but here in some cases four men had joined, and by spreading their two tents and the two flies over a framework of poles, they secured a sort of canvas hut which was quite roomy, and sheltered the occupants from the wind on three sides, while a fire of logs before the open fourth side made the improvised dwelling comfortable and cheerful,[98] and served also to dry the moccasins, coats, and blankets which had become damp on the march. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the distance they now heard some one calling off a list of names. Their friend listened intently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There,\" said he, with a woful face, \"I\u0027m wanted. I suppose it\u0027s my turn on guard to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you have to stand guard?\" asked David, with some surprise. \"We never do. What is there to guard against?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m sure,\" said the young man, replying to the latter question. \"Perhaps our Indians would meddle with the supplies, or it may be the rule was made in the interest of the cooks, for the last guard calls them up in the morning. Then, besides, there are generally beans to be boiled at night, and the guards do that, and, of course,\" he added with a grimace and a smack of the lips, \"we have to sample those beans to know when they are done. That\u0027s the one redeeming feature of guard duty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys laughed, and declared the guards were not to be blamed under the circumstances. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How long is your watch?\" asked Roly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Two hours. We draw lots for choice of watches. There are so many of us that the turn doesn\u0027t come round to the same man oftener than once a week, but it is pretty hard then to be pulled out of the blankets in the middle of the night after a long day\u0027s labor.[99] Well, I must leave you. Good-bye!\" and he was off to see about the guard duty. \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys returned to their camp, passing on the way the large tent of the Indians, who were singing a weird, monotonous native chant, varied by the occasional insertion of religious hymns which they had picked up at Haines\u0027 Mission. Uncle Will was telling his brother the information he had gathered in the neighboring camp. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They arrived here yesterday,\" he was saying, \"so their leader told me, and to-day they carried part of their goods forward five miles, where they cached them. The men returned from that trip just before we came. To-morrow they plan to take another and longer journey, moving their remaining supplies ten miles and then returning here. That will be a good twenty-mile march, and it will use them up so that I think they\u0027ll have to rest one day at least. Their leader, who was willing enough to talk about his present plans, said that as soon as possible after they had made the second cache, they would take an early start from here, and try to reach the timber on the other side the same day. You see they\u0027ll have virtually nothing to carry except tents and blankets until they reach their first cache, which they will pick up, leaving the second untouched. In other words, they will travel five miles with very light loads, and then fifteen with half-loads,â€”twenty miles[100] in all. They will return from that advanced camp the next day to their second cache and take that forward.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose,\" said Mr. Bradford, \"we shall have to employ the same tactics to some extent. We can\u0027t carry forward our whole outfit in one march.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s true,\" answered his brother. \"I think it would be wise to first carry half-loads ten miles. If the boys give out before we get back, we\u0027ll draw them. I\u0027m convinced that if we\u0027re to beat the big party, we must do it here, and work as we never worked before. One thing I\u0027m thankful for,â€”our loads are lighter than theirs, for you see we\u0027ve already taken provisions for myself and Long Peter as far as Klukshu Lake, and we two are now moving a share of yours. Besides, these fellows have an unusual amount of clothing and other truck in their clothing bags, and a great deal of heavy hardware. What did you learn from their Indians, Peter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Long Peter smiled and looked wise. \"Injuns say they no go to-morrow. Big snow come. White men no keep together; some get lost. No wood for fire. But we go if no wind. Me know t\u0027ail [trail].\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was a long speech for Long Peter, and it meant much. The morrow would decide the race. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48531.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š Among my first passions was that for exploration.
