{"id":42062,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X A PORCUPINE-HUNT AT PLEASANT CAMP","content":"As the Bradfords were able to travel more rapidly than Mrs. Shirley and her companions, the two parties separated on the following day. The trail turned to the west, ascending the gradual incline of the Klaheena River valley—a valley similar in character to that of the Chilkat—to a point called Pleasant Camp. \n \n Although the distance from Klukwan to Pleasant Camp was about the same as that from Pyramid Harbor to Klukwan, they were five days in covering it, since for much of the way the snow was soft, and progress correspondingly difficult. There was no more ice to travel upon, and the snow-crust would not bear them during the warmer part of the day. In fact, they could seldom walk upon it at all without their snow-shoes, the use of which the boys learned after a few hours\u0027 practice,—not, however, without some of those gymnastic performances predicted by the genial Mr. Kingsley. \n \n They crossed one wide but shallow stream by throwing brush into the water, which raised the sleds enough to keep the loads dry. At another point a considerable[78] delay was caused by a steep hill which the trail mounted at one side of the valley in order to avoid a difficult ford. Uncle Will pointed out a tree at the top of this hill, the bark of which was worn off in a circle a few feet above the ground, remarking that the Mysterious Thirty-six had evidently rigged a block and tackle there, and drawn up their sleds by a long rope. After following a rough, wooded ridge for perhaps a quarter of a mile, the trail led down again to the river flats. \n \n Each day brought them nearer the great range of snowy mountains, at the foot of which lay Pleasant Camp. There they would turn to the right and cross the mountains, which were in British territory, by the Chilkat Pass. The boys thought they had never seen a more beautiful valley than that of the Klaheena. In every direction were glistening peaks, their bases clothed with green spruce forests, which here and there spread out over the levels near the river, where they showed a sprinkling of bare-boughed poplars, willows, and alders. \n \n At one of their camps, where a small stream known as Boulder Creek flowed into the Klaheena from the north, the weather turned suddenly cold, with a bitter wind which the huge camp-fire hardly tempered. It was so cold in the tent that the boys slept in their Mackinaw coats, which usually they removed and rolled up for pillows. Nestling deep down into the blankets, they were warm enough, except when one or the other turned[79] over, disturbing the coverlets, and drawing a blast of cold air over their necks and shoulders. They did not take the precaution to pull their caps over their ears, relying on the protection of the blankets, but unfortunately, while they slept, their heads became entirely uncovered. Both boys found their ears slightly frost-bitten and very painful in the morning. \n \n When they attempted to draw on their shoe-packs, which had been left outside the tent, the leather tops and lacings were frozen so stiffly that it was necessary to thaw them out before a fire. Mr. Bradford\u0027s pocket thermometer registered three degrees below zero when they crept out into the crisp morning air and with numb fingers took down the tents and made ready the sleds. \n \n \"This is about as chilly as we shall have it,\" said Uncle Will, as he deftly turned the bacon in the frying-pan; \"and it\u0027s nothing to what I had on my first trip in. Fifty below is a nice bit colder than three. It\u0027s too late in the season for any more of that, and I\u0027m not sorry. We shall be unlucky though, if we don\u0027t reach the Alsek River before the ice breaks up, for cross-country travelling in that region is a hard proposition.\" \n \n \"How far away is the Alsek?\" asked David. \n \n \"About thirty miles on the other side of the Pass.\" \n \n \"And where do you suppose the mysterious gentlemen are now?\" \n \n \"Oh, they are doubtless working up toward the summit.[80] If they cross first, we can hardly hope to catch them, for I have no doubt the Alsek ice is firm yet, and on that they can move as fast as we can.\" \n \n \"Why is it we haven\u0027t overtaken them?\" inquired Roly. \n \n \"I suspect they don\u0027t stop on Sundays as we have.\" \n \n \"Then it\u0027s not a fair race,\" said Roly. \"They have an advantage over us.\" \n \n \"Only an apparent one,\" observed Mr. Bradford. \"They are likely to wear themselves out with such unremitting labor. We shall see.\" \n \n Two days later Pleasant Camp was reached, and the sleds were drawn up from the river flats to the top of a low plateau covered with a fine forest, mostly of spruce. To the west and north rose the massive white summits of the Coast Range, like giants guarding the gateways to the interior. \n \n A small party of Indians who had camped there were about to leave when the Bradfords arrived. Their household goods, consisting of blankets, kettles, pans, dried salmon, and a gun or two, were packed upon sleds, several of which were drawn by small, weak-looking dogs. There was one very old Indian who drew a light load upon a sled, while his wife, who was younger and stronger, bore a considerable burden upon her back. Her face was blackened to protect the skin from the blistering glare of sun and snow. The only other woman in[81] the party carried on her back a baby warmly rolled in a blanket. She wore a sort of hood, a skirt which reached to the knees, and deer-skin leggings and moccasins, and travelled easily over the drifts on light, narrow snow-shoes of native manufacture. \n \n When these Indians had disappeared up the mountain trail, Long Peter, who had cast admiring glances at David\u0027s rifle and Roly\u0027s shot-gun whenever the boys had removed them from their cases, came forward with a tempting proposal. \n \n \"You come with me,\" said he to the boys. \"Plenty porc\u0027pine here. Take guns and snow-shoes. Porc\u0027pine much good.\" \n \n The boys were on their feet in an instant at the prospect of a porcupine-hunt. At last they were to have an opportunity to test their new weapons. But first they must obtain permission to go. \n \n \"Aren\u0027t you too tired?\" asked Mr. Bradford, when they bore down upon that gentleman. \n \n \"Oh, no!\" shouted both together. \n \n \"Well then, you may go; but I think I\u0027ll go with you. I\u0027ve no doubt you\u0027ve listened very carefully to all my instructions, but you\u0027ll be pretty sure to be absent-minded in the excitement of the hunt. Do you remember the first rule, David?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said David. \"Never point a gun, loaded or unloaded, at yourself or any one else.\" \n \n [82] \n \n \"Correct,\" said Mr. Bradford. \"What was the second rule, Roly?\" \n \n \"Never leave a loaded gun where it can fall down, or be thrown down, or disturbed in any way.\" \n \n \"Right again. It was a violation of that rule which caused Lucky to be shot at Klukshu Lake, as your uncle told us. Now, David, the third rule.\" \n \n \"Unload the gun before climbing over fences, walls, and fallen trees, or entering thickets, or rough or slippery ground.\" \n \n \"Good,\" said Mr. Bradford. \"That is a rule which is often disregarded, and neglect of it has caused many accidents. You won\u0027t find any fences here, but there will be plenty of rough ground and fallen timber. The fourth rule, Roly.\" \n \n \"Let me see,\" said Roly, biting his lip with vexation as he tried in vain to recall it. \"Oh, yes! I remember it now. Wherever possible, keep the hammers at half-cock.\" \n \n \"Now,\" said Mr. Bradford, \"if you will bear those few rules in mind, you need not trouble yourselves about any others at present. Get your snow-shoes and guns and a few cartridges, and I\u0027ll be ready when you are.\" \n \n The boys started off with high anticipations a few minutes later, led by the Indian, and followed by their father. They all wore snow-shoes, for in the forest back of the camp, where the snow had not alternately frozen[83] and thawed as it had in the open valley, there was very little crust over the deep drifts. They wound in and out among the spruces, the Indian carefully examining the snow for tracks as he shuffled lightly along at a pace which the others could keep only with the greatest exertion, for their snow-shoes were heavier and wider than his, and they were not yet skilled. They had not gone a quarter of a mile when Long Peter paused at a fresh track which crossed their course at right angles, and led toward a little gully where there were several young spruce-trees with thick branches. \n \n \"Good,\" said he, and immediately started on the animal\u0027s trail. \n \n Roly became excited at once, and in swerving to the left to follow the Indian, he forgot to manage his snow-shoes with the care that is necessary, stepping upon his left snow-shoe with the right one, so that he could not raise the left foot for the next step. In an instant, carried forward by his own momentum, he plunged head-first into the soft, white, yielding drift, which closed over his head and shoulders. \n \n David, who was close behind, struggled in vain to choke a peal of laughter, and was thankful that Roly was not likely to hear it with his head in the snow. Long Peter, who had no scruples, laughed long after Roly had emerged. They all rushed to aid the struggling youngster, who was so hampered by the big shoes[84] that there seemed no possibility of his regaining his feet until they were disencumbered. David, after warning his brother not to kick, quickly loosened the moose-hide thongs and removed the snow-shoes, which done, the fallen youth picked himself up, and brushed the snow out of his eyes, mouth, and neck. \n \n \"Whew!\" he sputtered; \"how did I happen to do that?\" \n \n \"You turned the corner with the wrong foot,\" said his father. \"Where\u0027s your gun?\" \n \n The gun was nowhere to be seen until Long Peter fished it up out of the snow, where it had fallen underneath its owner. \n \n \"Is it loaded?\" asked Mr. Bradford. \n \n Roly thanked his stars that he could answer \"No,\" and added, \"I took this to be rough ground.\" \n \n \"You were right, Roly,\" said his father, much pleased. \"There was no need to carry a loaded gun here, for you always have plenty of time in shooting at this kind of game. You can readily see what kind of an accident might have happened. Now wipe off the gun as well as you can, and let\u0027s see where this track leads.\" \n \n They passed down into the gully, where many of the trees had been stripped of their bark and killed by the little animals. After following it a few rods, they turned up the farther bank, where the Indian paused at the foot of a dense spruce. All about the base of the[85] tree were the porcupine tracks, but they did not appear beyond. \n \n \"Porc\u0027pine here,\" said the red man, circling around the tree and gazing intently into its bushy top. A moment later he exclaimed, \"I see him! You, Dave, bring rifle here.\" \n \n David slipped a cartridge into his gun, and looked where the Indian pointed. He could see a dark body close to the tree-trunk among the upper branches. As he raised his rifle to his shoulder, he was surprised to find himself trembling violently. \n \n \"Well, well, Dave!\" exclaimed his father, noticing his nervousness, \"you\u0027ve got the buck fever over a porcupine, sure enough. Hadn\u0027t you better let me shoot him?\" \n \n \"Oh, no! I\u0027m all right,\" said David, bracing up mentally if not physically, and pulling the trigger. \n \n A few spruce needles and twigs rattled down as the shot rang out, but the porcupine was apparently unscathed. \n \n \"No good,\" said Long Peter. \"You no hit him.\" \n \n \"You fired too high,\" observed Mr. Bradford, \"and you shut your eyes. Keep at least one eye open, and be sure it\u0027s the one you sight with. Aim low and don\u0027t jerk.\" \n \n Roly petitioned to be allowed the second shot; but his father, seeing that David was much chagrined, ruled[86] that he should have another chance. Carefully observing directions, David fared better at the second trial. Through the smoke as he fired, he saw the porcupine come tumbling heavily down from branch to branch till it dropped into the snow and lay there motionless. It was quite dead, and Long Peter, with a grunt of satisfaction, took it up gingerly by the feet, taking care not to be pricked by the sharp quills which bristled all over the animal\u0027s back. \n \n \"Hurrah!\" cried Roly, \"now we shall have fresh meat.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said Mr. Bradford, \"a porcupine stew will be a welcome change from bacon,—but we ought to get one more at least. Long Peter here could eat the whole of this at one sitting without any trouble at all, eh, Peter?\" \n \n The Indian smacked his lips, and his eyes glistened, for the prickly little animals are considered such a delicacy by the natives, that they will gorge themselves even to sickness when they have the opportunity. \n \n A second porcupine was treed not far from the first. Roly brought it down at the first shot,—a feat which would certainly have puffed him with pride, had he not retained a vivid remembrance of his late inglorious downfall. \n \n They returned to camp in triumph, and found supper waiting. The porcupines were thrown into the fire, that[87] the quills might burn away, Uncle Will remarking that such chickens needed a great deal of singeing. Long Peter prepared them for the stew, and they were served up in fine style on the following morning, with rice and soup vegetables. The meat had a distinct flavor of spruce bark, the food of the animal; but it was not at all disagreeable, and the stew was voted an unqualified success. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48530.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
