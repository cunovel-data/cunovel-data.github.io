{"id":42053,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I A LETTER FROM ALASKA","content":"In a large, old-fashioned dwelling which overlooked from its hillside perch a beautiful city of Connecticut, the Bradford family was assembled for the evening meal. It was early in February, and the wind, which now and then whirled the snowflakes against the window-panes, made the pretty dining-room seem doubly cozy. But Mrs. Bradford shivered as she poured the tea. \n \n \"Just think of poor Will,\" she said, \"away off in that frozen wilderness! Oh, if we could only know that he is safe and well!\" and the gentle lady\u0027s brown eyes sought her husband\u0027s face as if for reassurance. \n \n Mr. Bradford was a tall, strongly built man of forty-five, with light-brown hair and mustache, and features that betrayed much care and responsibility. Upon him[2] as treasurer had fallen a great share of the burden of bringing a large manufacturing establishment through two years of financial depression, and his admirable constitution had weakened under the strain. But now a twinkle came into his gray eyes as he said, \"My dear, I hardly think Will is suffering. At least he wasn\u0027t a month ago.\" \n \n \"Why, how do you know?\" asked Mrs. Bradford. \"Has he written at last?\" \n \n For answer Mr. Bradford drew from the depths of an inside pocket a number of letters, from which he selected one whose envelope was torn and travel-stained. It bore a Canadian and an American postage stamp, as if the sender had been uncertain in which country it would be mailed, and wished to prepare it against either contingency. \n \n At sight of the foreign stamp Ralph,—or \"Roly,\" as he had been known ever since a certain playmate had called him \"Roly-poly\" because of his plumpness,—aged fifteen, was awake in an instant. Up to that moment his energies had been entirely absorbed in the laudable business of dulling a very keen appetite, but it quickly became evident that his instincts as a stamp collector were even keener. He had paused in the act of raising a bit of bread to his mouth, and made such a comical figure with his lips expectantly wide apart that his younger sister Helen, a little maid of nine,[3] was betrayed into a sudden and violent fit of laughter, in which, in spite of the superior dignity of eighteen years, their brother David was compelled to join. \n \n \"Yes,\" said Mr. Bradford, \"I received a letter from Will this afternoon. Suppose I read it aloud.\" Absolute quiet being magically restored, he proceeded as follows:— \n \n Rainy Hollow, Chilkat Pass, Jan. 9, 1898. \n \n Dear Brother Charles,—I am storm-bound at this place, and waiting for an opportunity to cross the summit, so what better can I do than write the letter so long deferred? \n \n I have been as far west as the Cook Inlet region, and have acquired some good coal properties. While there I heard from excellent authorities that rich gold placers have been discovered on the Dalton trail, which leads from Pyramid Harbor to Dawson City, at a point about two hundred miles inland. I thought it best to investigate the truth of this rumor, and am now on the way to the designated locality, with an Indian guide and dog-team. \n \n Now, as you know, I was able to take claims for you as well as for myself in the Cook Inlet country, by the powers of attorney which you sent me, but in the Canadian territory to which I am going the law does not allow this, and you can only secure a claim by purchase, or by being here in person to take it up. \n \n I don\u0027t suppose you are in a position to buy claims; but it struck me, Charles, that it would be a grand good thing if you could leave that work of yours awhile and rough it in these mountains. You looked worn out when I saw you last, and you need a change. This is a rugged country, but[4] a healthful one if a man takes care of himself, and nothing would do you more good than to take my advice and come. Why not bring the boys along? Too much schooling isn\u0027t good for growing lads, and they will lose nothing in the long run. \n \n Come prepared to stay six months. I will write our friend Kingsley at Seattle in regard to your outfit, and will send him directions for the journey. Start at once, for I think there\u0027ll be a rush in this direction very soon. \n \n You\u0027ll be surprised to find how comfortable you can be in your tent on the snow, even with the mercury below zero. Trust the directions I shall send to Kingsley, and I\u0027ll guarantee you against the suffering you read of, most of which is the result of ignorance and carelessness. \n \n I send this letter out by an Indian who leaves here to-morrow. \n \n With love to you all, I am, \n \n Your brother, \n \n William C. Bradford. \n \n \"Uncle Will\u0027s a brick!\" exclaimed Roly, promptly. \"Of course we shall go.\" Whereupon Helen burst into tears because she was not a boy. David managed to preserve outward calmness, but his eyes sparkled as he thought of the wonders he might soon see. As for Mrs. Bradford, she scarcely knew whether to be sad or glad. She was willing to believe her enthusiastic brother-in-law would not urge his own relatives to face unreasonable dangers. But to think of being separated from them half a year! After all, she could do no better than leave the matter to her husband. \n \n [5] \n \n \"Well, Charles,\" she said quite calmly, \"what do you propose to do?\" \n \n David and Roly trembled in their seats, while Mr. Bradford regarded them thoughtfully. \n \n \"I am inclined,\" he said at last, \"to think favorably of Will\u0027s proposal, so far as it concerns myself.\" \n \n At the word \"favorably\" both boys jumped, but when they heard the last of the sentence they looked very wretched and crestfallen. They did not understand the whole of Uncle Will\u0027s letter, but there was absolutely no doubt that he had suggested their coming. David ventured to remind his father that they were both a year in advance of most boys of their age in their school-work. \n \n This argument appeared to have weight with Mr. Bradford. He reflected, too, on the many youthful adventures of his own in the Adirondack woods, which he had often narrated in their hearing. It was but natural that they should wish to go. He was bound to admit that they had studied carefully and well, and had fairly earned an outing. David, dark-haired and brown-eyed like his mother, had reached the age of rapid growth. He was shooting up like a weed, and his face was paler than it should be. Roly was of light complexion, and round and ruddy. Nothing more could be desired of him in the matter of health, yet his father knew how keenly he would feel the disappointment if[6] his brother were permitted to go and he were left behind. \n \n Mr. Bradford looked inquiringly at his wife. \"Can you spare them?\" he asked. \n \n It was a hard question. Mrs. Bradford would have preferred to keep the boys at home, but she had travelled extensively before her marriage, and knew the value of travel. She was ambitious for her sons and wished them to have every advantage. But it was not without a flood of affectionate tears that she consented at last to let them go. \n \n The matter being thus decided, at a sitting, as it were, the evening was spent in a study of maps and guide-books; and long after they went to bed the boys lay awake and talked over their good fortune. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1642/48521.html","bookId":1228,"book":{"id":1228,"title":"Gold-Seeking on the Dalton Trail","description":"简介： Among my first passions was that for exploration.
