{"id":11316,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 3: The Outbreak Of War.","content":"As Lindsay had predicted, the marshal had, on the evening of the day Fergus joined his regiment, said to him: \"I generally have half an hour\u0027s fencing the first thing of a morning, Fergus. It is good exercise, and keeps one\u0027s muscles lissome. Come round to my room at six. I should like to see what the instructors at home have done for you, and I may be able to put you up to a few tricks of the sword that may be of use to you, if you are ever called upon to break his majesty\u0027s edicts against duelling.\" Fergus, of course, kept the appointment. \"Very good. Very good, indeed,\" the marshal said, after the first rally. \"You have made the most of your opportunities. Your wrist is strong and supple, your eye quick. You are a match, now, for most men who have not worked hard in a school of arms. Like almost all our countrymen, you lack precision. Now, let us try again.\" For a few minutes Fergus exerted himself to the utmost, but failed to get his point past the marshal\u0027s guard. He had never seen fencing like this. Keith\u0027s point seemed to be ever threatening him. The circles that were described were so small that the blade seemed scarcely to move; and yet every thrust was put aside by a slight movement of the wrist, and he felt that he was at his opponent\u0027s mercy the whole time. Presently there was a slight jerk and, on the instant, his weapon was twisted from his hand and sent flying across the room. Keith smiled at his look of bewilderment. \"You see, you have much to learn, Fergus.\" \"I have indeed, sir. I thought that I knew something about fencing, but I see that I know nothing at all.\" \"That is going too far the other way, lad. You know, for example, a vast deal more than Lindsay did when he came to me, six months ago. I fancy you know more than he does now, or ever will know; for he still pins his faith on the utility of a slashing blow, as if the sabre had a chance against a rapier, in the hands of a skilful man. However, I will give you a lesson every morning, and I should advise you to go to Van Bruff every evening. \"I will give you a note to him. He is by far the best master we have. Indeed, he is the best in Europe. I will tell him that the time at your disposal is too short for you to attempt to become a thorough swordsman; but that you wish to devote yourself to learning a few thrusts and parries, such as will be useful in a duel, thoroughly and perfectly. I myself will teach you that trick I played on you just now, and two others like it; and I think it possible that in a short time you will be able to hold your own, even against men who may know a good deal more of the principles and general practice of the art than yourself.\" Armed with a note from the marshal, Fergus went the next day to the famous professor. The latter read the letter through carefully, and then said: \"I should be very glad to oblige the marshal, for whom I have the highest respect, and whom I regard as the best swordsman in Europe. I often practise with him, and always come away having learned something. Moreover, the terms he offers, for me to give you an hour and a half\u0027s instruction every evening, are more than liberal. But every moment of my time in the evening is occupied, from five to ten. Could you come at that hour?\" \"Certainly I could, professor.\" \"Then so be it. Come at ten, punctually. My school is closed at that hour, but you will find me ready for you.\" Accordingly, during the next three weeks Fergus worked, from ten till half-past eleven, with Herr Van Bruff; and from six till half past with the marshal. His mountain training was useful indeed to him now; for the day\u0027s work in the barrack was in itself hard and fatiguing and, tough as his muscles were, his wrist at first ached so at nights that he had to hold it, for some time, under a tap of cold water to allay the pain. At the end of a week, however, it hardened again; and he was sustained by the commendations of his two teachers, and the satisfaction he felt in the skill he was acquiring. \"Where is your new aide-de-camp, marshal?\" the king asked, one evening. It was the close of one of his receptions. \"As a rule, these young fellows are fond of showing off in their uniforms, at first.\" \"He is better employed, sire. He has the makings of a very fine swordsman and, having some reputation myself that way, I should be glad that my young cousin should be able to hold his own well, when we get to blows with the enemy. So I and Van Bruff have taken him in hand, and for the last three weeks he has made such progress that this morning, when we had open play, it put me on my mettle to hold my own. So, what with that and his regimental work, his hands are more than full; and indeed, he could not get through it, had he to attend here in the evening; and I know that as soon as he has finished his supper he turns in for a sound sleep, till he is woke in time to dress and get to the fencing school, at ten. Had there been a longer time to spare, I would not have suffered him to work so hard; but seeing that in a few days we may be on the march to the frontier, we have to make the most of the time.\" \"He has done well, Keith, and his zeal shows that he will make a good soldier. Yes, another three days, and our messenger should return from Vienna; and the next morning, unless the reply is satisfactory, the troops will be on the move. After that, who knows?\" During the last few days, the vague rumours that had been circulating had gained strength and consistency. Every day fresh regiments arrived and encamped near the city; and there were reports that a great concentration of troops was taking place, at Halle, under the command of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick; and another, under the Duke of Bevern, at Frankfort-on-the-Oder. Nevertheless, the public announcement that war was declared with Austria, and that the army would march for the frontier, in three days\u0027 time, came as a sudden shock. The proclamation stated that, it having been discovered that Austria had entered into a secret confederacy with other powers to attack Prussia; and the king having, after long and fruitless negotiations, tried to obtain satisfaction from that power; no resource remained but to declare war, at once, before the confederates could combine their forces for the destruction of the kingdom. Something like dismay was, at first, excited by the proclamation. A war with Austria was, in itself, a serious undertaking; but if the latter had powerful allies, such as Russia, France, and Saxony--and it was well known that all three looked with jealousy on the growing power of the kingdom--the position seemed well-nigh desperate. Among the troops, however, the news was received with enthusiasm. Confident in their strength and discipline, the question of the odds that might be assembled against them in no way troubled them. The conquest of Silesia had raised the prestige of the army, and the troops felt proud that they should have the opportunity of proving their valour in an even more serious struggle. Never was there a more brilliant assembly than that at the palace, the evening before the troops marched. All the general officers and their staffs were assembled, together with the ladies of the court, and those of the nobility and army. The king was in high good humour, and moved about the rooms, chatting freely with all. \"So you have come to see us at last, young sir,\" he said to Fergus. \"I should scold you, but I hear that you have been utilizing your time well. \"Remember that your sword is to be used against the enemies of the country, only,\" and nodding, he walked on. The Princess Amelia was the centre of a group of ladies. She was a charming princess, but at times her face bore an expression of deep melancholy; and all knew that she had never ceased to mourn the fate of the man she would have chosen, Baron Trench, who had been thrown into prison by her angry father, for his insolence in aspiring to his daughter\u0027s hand. \"You must be glad that your hard work is over, Drummond,\" Lindsay said, as they stood together watching the scene. \"I am glad that the drill is over,\" Fergus replied, \"but I should have liked my work with the professor to have gone on for another six months.\" \"Ah, well! You will have opportunities to take it up again, when we return, after thrashing the Austrians.\" \"How long will that be, Lindsay?\" The latter shrugged his shoulders. \"Six months or six years; who can tell?\" he said. \"If it be true that Russia and France, to say nothing of Saxony, are with her, it is more likely to be years than months, and we may both come out colonels by the time it is over.\" \"That is, if we come out at all,\" Fergus said, with a smile at the other\u0027s confidence. \"Oh! Of course, there is that contingency, but it is one never worth reckoning with. At any rate, it is pretty certain that, if we do fall, it will be with odds against us; but of course, as aides-de-camp our chance is a good deal better than that of regimental officers. \"At any rate, you have had good preparation for the campaign, for your work will be child\u0027s play in comparison to what you have been going through. How you stood it, I cannot make out. I worked pretty hard when I first arrived; but the drill for the first six months was tremendous, and I used to be glad to crawl into bed, as soon as I had had my supper. \"Well, you have been a poor companion so far, Drummond.\" \"I am afraid I have been, but will try and make up for it, in the future. \"I suppose there is no doubt that we shall march, in the first place, on Dresden.\" \"I think that there is no doubt of that. There is no Saxon army to speak of, certainly nothing that can offer any serious opposition. From there there are three or four passes by which we could pour into Bohemia. Saxony is a rich country, too, and will afford us a fine base for supplies, as we move on. I suppose the Austrians will collect an army to oppose us, in Bohemia. When we have thrashed them, I expect we shall go on straight to Vienna.\" Fergus laughed. \"It all sounds easy enough, Lindsay. I only hope that it will come off just as you prophesy.\" \"That is one advantage of fighting in a foreign service, Fergus. One fights just as stoutly for victory as if one were fighting for home, but if one is beaten it does not affect one so much. It is sad to see the country overrun, and pillaged; but the houses are not the houses of our own people, the people massacred are not one\u0027s own relations and friends. One\u0027s military vanity may be hurt by defeat; otherwise, one can bear it philosophically.\" \"I never looked at it in that light before, Lindsay, but no doubt there is a great deal in what you say. If my father had fallen on a German battlefield, instead of at Culloden, our estates would not have been confiscated, our glens harried, and our clansmen hunted down and massacred. No, I see there is a great difference. I suppose I should fight just as hard, against the Austrians, as I should have done against the English at Culloden, had I been there; but defeat would have none of the same consequences. No, putting it as you do, I must own that there is a distinct advantage in foreign service, that I never appreciated before. \"But I see people are leaving, and I am not sorry. As we are going to be up before daybreak, the sooner one turns in the better.\" Karl had received the order to call his master at three, to have breakfast ready at half past, and the horses at the door at four, with somewhat less than his usual stolidity. \"You will have harder work in the future, Karl,\" Fergus said. \"I shall be glad of it, sir. Never have I had such a lazy time as I have had for the last month. The first three or four days were very pleasant; then I began to think that I should like a little to do, so as to remind me that there was such a thing as work. But the last fortnight has been terrible. A man cannot sleep for twenty-four hours, and if it had not been that Donald and I have had an occasional quarrel, as to our respective regiments and over the native land he is so fond of bragging about, I should have been ready to hang myself. \"Ah, sir, how often have I to thank my stars that I did not take my discharge!--which I could have asked for, as I have served my time. I had thought of it, many times; and had said to myself how delightful it would be to hear the morning call sound, at a barracks near, and to turn over in my bed and go to sleep again; to have no guard to keep, no sergeant to bully or provost guard to arrest one, if one has taken a cup too much. This fortnight has shown me the folly of such ideas. It has taught me when I am well off, and what misery it is to be one\u0027s own master, and to be always wondering how the day is to be got through.\" \"Well, you are not likely to have to complain that you have nothing to do, for some time now, Karl.\" \"No, cornet. I have felt a new man, since I heard the great news. There is always plenty to do, on a campaign. There are the horses to be cleaned, food to be cooked, forage and rations to be fetched. Then, too, on a campaign every one is merry and good tempered, and one sings as one marches and sits round the campfire. One may be cold and wet and hungry, but who cares? One swears at the moment, but one laughs again, as soon as the sun shines.\" \"Well, Karl, you had best turn in at once, for at three o\u0027clock we shall want to be called.\" \"You can rely upon my waking, sir. Does my officer wish to take a full-dress suit with him?\" \"No; the order is that all are to start in marching order, and that all baggage is to be cut down to the smallest proportions. No officer is to take more than can be carried in his valises.\" It was the first week in August when the three columns, each twenty thousand strong, moved from their respective starting points. Although the king was nominally in command of the central division, Marshal Keith was the real commander. He rode with the king at the head of the column, and his aides-de-camp, and those of Frederick, were constantly on their way up and down the line, carrying orders and bringing in reports as to the manner in which the regiments maintained their respective positions, and especially how the artillery and baggage train kept up. There was no necessity, at present, for taking precautions. The march would for some days lead through Prussia, and it was morally certain that the Saxon army--which was small and scattered and, even if united, would not equal the strength of one of the Prussian armies--would not attempt any serious resistance; for the country was flat, and there would be no defiles where a small force of men could successfully oppose a larger one. Nevertheless, the daily marches were long for the infantry and the baggage, but by no means fatiguing for mounted men. The staff and aides-de-camp, with their orderlies, rode behind the leaders. The troopers were sometimes employed, instead of the officers, when a short written order had to be sent back to the rear of the column. The harvest having been gathered in, the cavalry rode across the open country, thus reducing the length of the column. The day was very hot, and the infantry opened their ranks, as much as possible, to allow the passage of what little air was moving. At nine o\u0027clock the troops were halted. Each man had been served with a breakfast, before starting; and the haversacks were now opened, and a meal made of the bread they contained, washed down with an allowance of rough wine, carried in each regimental waggon. Then the men sat down, under the shade of greatcoats supported by ramrods and other contrivances, and either slept or talked until half-past two; when the bugle sounded. The greatcoats were rolled up and strapped on to the knapsacks, then there was a vigorous use of the brush, to remove the thick dust gathered on the march. At three the column got into motion again, and halted for the night at half-past six; when fires were lighted, coppers put on, and the main meal of the day presently served. The rations of the officers were the same as those of the men, but the greater part of them supplemented the food by that carried in their orderlies\u0027 saddlebags. Lindsay, Fergus, and the marshals other two aides-de-camp had arranged that, when possible, they should mess together; and their servants should prepare the meal by turns, while those not so engaged looked after the horses, saw that they were fed, watered, and groomed. The servants were all old campaigners, and though neither Lindsay nor Fergus had thought of giving them orders to that effect, both Donald and Karl had laid in a stock of provisions. Donald had cooked a pair of fowls on the previous evening. Karl had bought a sucking pig. One of the German officer\u0027s servants had a huge piece of salt beef, that had already been boiled, while the other had a hare. It was agreed at once that the fowls should be left for early breakfast; and the beef put aside for dinner, and for supper, also, if nothing else could be obtained. Karl, as the servant of the junior officer, was cook for the evening, and he acquitted himself admirably. Each officer carried in his saddlebag a tin plate, a drinking horn, and a knife, fork, and spoon. There was no dish, but the spit was handed round, and each cut off a portion. Soup made from the ration of meat was first served, then the hare, and then the sucking pig, while the four orderlies had an ample meal from the ration of meat. A supply of spirits had been carried in the staff waggon. This they took, plentifully watered, with the meal; with a stronger cup afterwards. The night was so fine that all agreed that it was not worthwhile to erect the tent carried for them in the waggon. At eight o\u0027clock the order for the next day\u0027s march came out, and two of the king\u0027s orderlies started on horseback with copies of it to the commanders of brigades, who in their turn communicated to the colonels of their respective regiments. The next evening the force encamped round Torgau, a very strong fortress, where a great store of provisions had been collected. Ample quarters were assigned to the marshal and his staff in the town. Here they halted for a day to allow the other armies, which had both farther to march, to keep abreast of them on their respective lines of route. Then, following the Elbe, the army arrived after two marches in front of Dresden. The court of Saxony had, for years, been wasting the revenues of the country in extravagance and luxury; while intriguing incessantly with Austria, and dreaming of obtaining an increase of territory at the expense of Prussia. No effort had been made to prepare to carry out the engagements entered into with Austria; and the army, utterly neglected, numbered but some fifteen thousand. These were scattered over the country, and but poorly provided with artillery. When, then, the news arrived that three Prussian armies had crossed the frontier, there was no thought of resistance; but orders were despatched for the whole force to concentrate at Pirna, a strongly fortified camp among the defiles of the mountains separating Saxony from Bohemia. The position was almost an impregnable one, and they could receive reinforcements from Bohemia. On the arrival of the Prussian army the king fled, and Dresden threw open its gates. As Frederick hoped to detach Saxony from the alliance against him, the greater portion of the army were encamped outside the town; three or four regiments, only, marching in and quartering themselves in the empty Saxon barracks. The aid Saxony could render Frederick would be insignificant, but it was most desirable for him that he should ensure its neutrality, in order to secure his communications with Prussia when he marched forward into Bohemia. Finding the king had gone, his first step was to send a general officer, with a party of soldiers, to seize the archives in the palace. Among these was discovered the prize he most desired to find; namely a signed copy of the secret treaty, between Austria, Russia, France, and Saxony, for the invasion and partition of Prussia. Copies of this document were instantly sent off to the courts of Europe, thus affording an ample justification for what would otherwise have appeared a wholly unprovoked attack by Prussia upon her neighbours. Had it not been for the discovery of this document, Frederick would probably have always remained under the stigma of engaging in an unprovoked and ambitious war; for the court of Austria had hitherto, positively and categorically, declared to Frederick\u0027s ambassador and envoys the non-existence of any such treaty or agreement between the powers. As the queen had remained in the palace, Frederick took up his abode in another royal building, Marshal Keith and a large number of officers being also quartered there. In order to prevent any broils with the citizens, orders were issued that certain places of refreshment were to be used only by officers, while the soldiers were only to frequent wine and beer shops selected in the neighbourhood of the barracks, and were strictly forbidden to enter any others. Any soldier caught in an act of theft or pillage was to be hung, forthwith, and all were enjoined to observe a friendly demeanour to the people. One evening, Fergus had been sent with a message to the camp, two miles from the town. It was nearly ten o\u0027clock when he started to ride back. When within half a mile of the town he heard a pistol shot, in the direction of a large house, a quarter of a mile from the road. Without hesitation he turned his horse\u0027s head in that direction. In a couple of minutes he arrived at a pair of large gates. They were closed, but he dismounted, fastened the bridle chain to them and, snatching the pistols from his holsters, ran along by the side of a high wall, until he came to a tree growing close to it. With some difficulty, for his high boots were ill adapted to such work, he climbed the tree, got on to the wall, and dropped down. He was in large park-like grounds. Guided by a light in a window, he ran to the house. The door was closed. After hesitating for a moment he ran along and, soon coming, as he expected, to an open window, he at once climbed through it. A door was open and, passing on, he entered a large hall in which a light was burning. Pausing to listen now, he heard voices upstairs and, holding a pistol in each hand and his drawn sword in his teeth, he lightly ascended the stairs. On the landing two men lay dead. Light was issuing from a half-closed door and, noiselessly approaching it, he looked in. It was a small room. At the end stood eight or ten scared women, huddled together; while a soldier, with a pistol in one hand and a sword in the other, stood sentry over them. These were evidently the servants of the chateau, who had been unceremoniously hauled from their beds and gathered there, under a guard, to prevent them from screaming or giving any alarm. As Fergus was equally anxious that no alarm should be given, at present, he retired quietly. A pair of double doors faced the top of the staircase. This was evidently the grand reception room and, listening intently, he could hear a murmur of voices inside. Turning the handle and throwing them suddenly open, he entered. Upon the floor lay the body of a gentleman. A lady, pale as death and in a half-fainting condition, leant back in a settee; while a girl of thirteen or fourteen lay on a couch, with bound hands and a handkerchief fastened across her mouth. Three soldiers were engaged in examining the contents of a large coffer of jewels. As the door opened they turned round and, on seeing a solitary officer, sprang forward with terrible oaths. Fergus shot one of them as they did so, dropped the pistol, and seized his sword. Both men fired. Fergus felt a stinging sensation in his left arm, and the pistol held in that hand dropped to the ground. Confident in his swordsmanship, he awaited the onslaught of the two marauders. The swords clashed, and at the second pass one of them fell back, run through the body. The other, shouting for aid, stood on the defensive. Fergus heard the rush of heavy steps coming down the staircase and, just as three other men rushed into the room, he almost clove his opponent\u0027s head in two, with a tremendous blow from his claymore. Two of the newcomers fired hastily--and both missed Two of the newcomers fired their pistols hastily--both missed--then rushed at him with their swords; and as he was hotly engaged with them the third, who was the sentry who had been placed over the women, advanced slowly, with his pistol pointed, with the intention of making sure of his aim. He paused close to the combatants, waiting for an opportunity to fire between the shifting figures of his comrades; when a white figure, after peering in at the door, ran swiftly forward and threw herself on his back, hurling him forward to the ground, his pistol exploding as he fell. One of the others started back at the sound, and as he did so Fergus ran him through the body. He then attacked his remaining opponent, and after a few passes laid him dead beside his comrade. Picking up his own fallen pistol, Fergus blew out the brains of the soldier, who was struggling to free himself from the girl\u0027s weight, and then helped her to her feet. \"Well done, my brave girl!\" he said. \"You have saved my life. Now run and tell those wenches to stop screaming, and to come and help their mistress. These scoundrels are all killed, and there is nothing more for them to be alarmed at.\" Then he ran to the girl on the sofa, cut her cords with a dagger, and freed her from the gag. As he did so, she leapt up and ran to her mother\u0027s side; while Fergus, kneeling by the gentleman who had fallen before he had entered, turned him over and, laying his ear over his heart, listened intently. \"He is alive,\" he said. \"His heart beats, but faintly. Tell the maids to fetch some cordial.\" The women were coming in now, some crying hysterically, some shrieking afresh at the sight of the bodies that were strewn about the room. \"Silence!\" Fergus shouted sternly. \"Now, while one runs to fetch some cordial, do three others come here, and aid me to lift your master gently on to this couch.\" The maid who had overthrown the soldier at once came forward to his assistance. \"Now, Truchen and Lisa,\" the young girl said, stamping her foot, \"come at once. \"Do you, Caroline, run and fetch the stand of cordials from the dining room.\" The two women approached timidly. \"Now,\" Fergus said, \"get your arm under his shoulders, on your side, and I will do the same. One of you others support his head when we lift, the other take his feet.\" So, gently he was raised and laid on the couch. By the time this was done, the woman returned with a bottle of spirits. \"Now,\" he said, \"water and a glass.\" The young girl ran and fetched a carafe of water and a tumbler, standing on a table by the wall. Her hands shook as she handed it to Fergus. \"Are you sure that he is not dead, sir?\" she asked, in a hushed voice. \"Quite sure. I fear that he is grievously wounded, but he certainly lives. Now, get another glass and put some spirits in and fill it up with water, and make your mother drink it, as soon as you have roused her from her faint.\" Fergus now gave all his attention to the wounded man, poured two or three spoonfuls of strong spirits and water between his lips, and then proceeded to examine his wounds. He had three. One was a very severe cut upon the shoulder. His left arm had been broken by a pistol bullet, and he had a dangerous sword thrust in the body. Under Fergus\u0027 direction the servant had cut off the doublet and, after pouring some more spirits down the wounded man\u0027s throat, he bade one of the other women fetch him some soft linen, and a sheet. When these arrived he made a pad of the linen, and bound it over the wounded man\u0027s shoulder with some strips torn from the sheet. Then he sent for some straight strips of wood, cut them to the right length, wrapped some linen round them and, straightening the arm, applied them to it and, with the assistance of the girl, bandaged it firmly. Then he placed a pad of linen over the wound in the body, and passed bandages round and round. \"Well done!\" he said to his assistant. \"You are a stout girl, and a brave one.\" Then he turned to the others, who were crowded round their mistress. \"Stand back,\" he said, \"and throw open the window and let the air come to her. That will do. \"The young lady and this girl will be enough, now. Do the rest of you run off and get some clothes on.\" \"She has opened her eyes once, sir.\" \"She will come round directly, young lady. Pour a spoonful or two from this glass between her lips. It is stronger than that you have in your hand. She has had a terrible shock, but as soon as she hears that your father is alive, it will do more for her than all our services.\" \"Will he live, sir?\" \"That I cannot say for certain, but I have great hopes that he will do so. However, I will send a surgeon out, as soon as I get to the city.\" The lady was longer in her swoon than Fergus had expected, and the servants had returned before she opened her eyes. \"Now,\" he said, \"do four of you lend me your assistance. It would be well to carry this sofa with your master into the next room; and then we will take your mistress in there, too, so that she will be spared seeing these ruffians scattered about, when she comes to herself.\" The doors leading to the adjoining apartment were opened, candles lighted there, and the wounded man carried in on his sofa. \"And now for your mistress. It will be easier to lift her out of the chair, and carry her in bodily.\" This he did, with the assistance of two of the servants. \"Now,\" he said to the young girl, \"do you stay by her, my brave maid. I think she will recover in a minute or two. Her eyelids moved as I brought her in. I will look round and see about things. \"Were these the only two men in the house?\" he asked the other women, as he joined them on the landing. \"No, sir. There were six men. The other four have gone to bed, but the two outside always waited up till the count and countess retired.\" \"Where are their rooms?\" he asked, taking a candle. One of the women led him upstairs. As he expected, he found the four men lying dead. One had apparently leapt up as the door was opened, and the other three had been killed in their beds. \"Where can I get help from?\" \"There are the men at the stables. It is at the back of the house, three or four hundred yards away.\" \"Well, take one of the other women with you, and go and rouse them. Tell them to dress and come here, at once.\" He now went down to the gate, undid the fastening, and then led his horse up to the house. In a few minutes the stablemen arrived. He ordered them to carry the bodies of the six marauders out, and lay them in front of the house. When they had done so, they were to take those of the servants and place them in an outhouse. Then he went upstairs again. \"The countess has recovered, sir,\" one of the women said. \"Tell her that I will send one of the army surgeons down, at once. But first, bandage my arm. It is but a flesh wound, I know; but I am feeling faint, and am sure that it is keeping on bleeding. \"Here, my girl,\" he said to the one who had before assisted, \"I can trust to you not to faint.\" With her assistance he took off his coat, the arm of which was saturated with blood. \"You had better cut off the sleeve of the shirt,\" he said. This was done, and the nature of the wound was seen. A ball had ploughed through the flesh three inches below the shoulder, inflicting a gaping but not serious wound. \"It is lucky that it was not the inside of the arm,\" he said to the girl, as she bandaged it up; \"for had it been, I should have bled to death in a very few minutes. \"Has the count opened his eyes yet?\" \"No, sir. He is lying just as he was.\" \"What is the gentleman\u0027s name?\" \"Count Eulenfurst.\" \"You had better give me a draught of wine, before I start. I feel shaken, and it is possible that riding may set my wound bleeding again.\" Having drunk a goblet of wine, Fergus went down and mounted his horse. As he did so, he said to one of the men: \"Take a lantern, and go down to the spot where the road hither turns off from the main road. A surgeon will be here in half an hour, or perhaps in twenty minutes. He will be on the lookout for you and your lantern.\" Events had passed quickly, and the church bell chimed a quarter to eleven as he rode through the streets of Dresden. In three minutes he drew up at the entrance to the royal quarters. As he dismounted, Karl came out. \"Keep the horse here, Karl,\" he said. \"It may be wanted in a minute or two again.\" \"Are you hurt, sir?\" the man asked as he dismounted, for he saw his face by the light of the torches on each side of the gateway. \"It is only a flesh wound, and of no consequence; but I have lost a good deal of blood.\" He made his way up the staircase to the marshal\u0027s quarters. He was feeling dizzy and faint, now. \"Is the marshal in his room?\" he asked. \"He is in, sir, but--\" \"I would speak to him immediately. \u0027Tis a most urgent matter.\" The servant went in, a moment later held the door open, and said: \"Will you enter, sir?\" Fergus entered, and made the usual formal salute to the marshal. Two or three other officers were in the room, but he did not heed who they were, nor hear the exclamations of surprise that broke out at his appearance. \"I beg to report, sir, that the house of the Count Eulenfurst has been attacked by marauders, belonging to one of the Pomeranian regiments. The count is desperately wounded, and I pray that a surgeon may be sent instantly to his aid. The house stands back from the road, about half a mile from the north gate. A man with a lantern will be standing in the road to guide him to it. My horse is at the door below, in readiness to take him. I pray you to allow me to retire.\" He swayed and would have fallen, had not the marshal and one of the others present caught him, and laid him down on a couch. \"He is wounded, marshal,\" the other officer said. \"This sleeve is saturated with blood.\" The marshal raised his voice, and called an attendant: \"Run to the quarters of staff surgeon Schmidt, and ask him to come here immediately, and to bring another of his staff with him, if there is one in.\" In two minutes the king\u0027s chief surgeon entered, followed by another of his staff. \"First look to the wound of Cornet Drummond,\" the marshal said. \"It is in the arm, and I trust that he has only fainted from loss of blood.\" The surgeons examined the wound. \"It is in no way serious, marshal. As you say, he has fainted from loss of blood. He must have neglected it for some time. Had it been bandaged at once, it would only have had the consequence of disabling his arm for a fortnight or so.\" The assistant had already hurried away to get lint and bandages. Another voice now spoke. \"Surgeon Schmidt, you will please at once mount Mr. Drummond\u0027s horse, which is standing at the door. Ride out through the north gate. When you have gone about half a mile you will see a man with a lantern. He will lead you to the house of Count Eulenfurst, who has been grievously wounded by some marauders. Surgeon Morfen will follow you, as soon as he has bandaged Mr. Drummond\u0027s wounds. There may be more wounded there who may need your care. \"Major Armfeldt, will you order a horse to be brought round at once for the surgeon, then hurry to the barracks. Order the colonel to turn out a troop of horse instantly, and let him scour the country between the north gate and the camp, and arrest every straggler he comes across.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3134/86164.html","bookId":890,"book":{"id":890,"title":"With Frederick the Great","description":"简介： It was early in 1756 that a Scottish trader, from Edinburgh, entered the port of Stettin.
