{"id":75415,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"August fifteenth, it was a day following other days of sweat and hazy skies. There were no puffy white clouds or balmy breezes, only a wall of humidity nearly thick enough to swim in.\\n\\n Reports on the six and eleven o\u0027clock news glumly promised more to come. In the long, lazy last days of summer, the heat wave moving into its second, pitiless week was the biggest story in Washington, D.C.\\n\\n The Senate was adjourned until September, so Capitol Hill moved sluggishly. Relaxing before a much touted European trip, the President cooled off at Camp David. Without the day-to-day shuffle of politics, Washington was a city of tourists and street vendors. Across from the Smithsonian a mime performed for a sticky crowd that had stopped more to catch its collective breath than in appreciation of art. Pretty summer dresses wilted, and children whined for ice cream.\\n\\n The young and the old flocked to Rock Creek Park, using the shade and water as a defense against the heat. Soft drinks and lemonade were consumed by the gallon, beer and wine downed in the same quantity, but less conspicuously. Bottles had a way of disappearing when park police cruised by. During picnics and cookouts people mopped sweat, charred hot dogs, and watched babies in diapers toddle on the grass. Mothers shouted at children to stay away from the water, not to run near the road, to put down a stick or a stone. The music from portable radios was, as usual, loud and defiant; hot tracks, the deejays called them, and reported temperatures in the high nineties.\\n\\n Small groups of students drew together, some sitting on the rocks above the creek to discuss the fate of the world, others sprawled on the grass, more interested in the fate of their tans. Those who could spare the time and the gas had fled to the beach or the mountains. A few college students found the energy to throw Frisbees, the men stripping down to shorts to show off torsos uniformly bronzed.\\n\\n A pretty young artist sat under a tree and sketched idly. After several attempts to draw her attention to the biceps he\u0027d been working on for six months, one of the players took a more obvious route. The Frisbee landed on her pad with a plop. When she looked up in annoyance, he jogged over. His grin was apologetic, and calculated, he hoped, to dazzle.\\n\\n \"Sorry. Got away from me.\"\\n\\n After pushing a fall of dark hair over her shoulder, the artist handed the Frisbee back to him. \"It\u0027s all right.\" She went back to her sketching without sparing him a glance.\\n\\n Youth is nothing if not tenacious. Hunkering down beside her, he studied her drawing. What he knew about art wouldn\u0027t have filled a shot glass, but a pitch was a pitch. \"Hey, that\u0027s really good. Where\u0027re you studying?\"\\n\\n Recognizing the ploy, she started to brush him off, then looked up long enough to catch his smile. Maybe he was obvious, but he was cute. \" Georgetown.\"\\n\\n \"No kidding? Me too. Pre-law.\"\\n\\n Impatient, his partner called across the grass. \"Rod! We going for a brew or not?\"\\n\\n \"You come here often?\" Rod asked, ignoring his friend. The artist had the biggest brown eyes he\u0027d ever seen.\\n\\n \"Now and again.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t we-\"\\n\\n \"Rod, come on. Let\u0027s get that beer.\"\\n\\n Rod looked at his sweaty, slightly overweight friend, then back into the cool brown eyes of the artist. No contest. \"I\u0027ll catch you later, Pete,\" he called out, then let the Frisbee go in a high, negligent arch.\\n\\n \"Finished playing?\" the artist asked, watching the flight of the Frisbee.\\n\\n He grinned, then touched the ends of her hair. \"Depends.\"\\n\\n Swearing, Pete started off in pursuit of the disk. He\u0027d just paid six bucks for it. After nearly tripping over a dog, he scrambled down a slope, hoping the Frisbee wouldn\u0027t land in the creek. He\u0027d paid a lot more for his leather sandals. It circled toward the water, making him curse out loud, then hit a tree and careened off into some bushes. Dripping sweat and thinking about the cold Moosehead waiting for him, Pete shoved at branches and cleared his way.\\n\\n His heart stopped, then sent the blood beating in his head. Before he could draw breath to yell, his lunch of Fritos and two hot dogs came up, violently.\\n\\n The Frisbee had landed two feet from the edge of the creek. It lay new and red and cheerful on a cold white hand that seemed to offer it back.\\n\\n She had been Carla Johnson, a twenty-three-year-old drama student and part-time waitress. Twelve to fifteen hours before, she had been strangled with a priest\u0027s amice. White, edged in gold.\\n\\n Detective ben paris slumped at his desk after finishing his written report on the Johnson homicide. He\u0027d typed the facts, using two fingers in a machine gun style. But now they played back to him. No sexual assault, no apparent robbery. Her purse had been under her, with twenty-three dollars and seventy-six cents and a MasterCard in it. An opal ring that would have hocked for about fifty had still been on her finger. No motive, no suspects. Nothing.\\n\\n Ben and his partner had spent the afternoon interviewing the victim\u0027s family. An ugly business, he thought. Necessary, but ugly.\\n\\n They had unearthed the same answers at every turn. Carla had wanted to be an actress. Her life had been her studies. She had dated, but not seriously-she\u0027d been too devoted to an ambition she would never achieve.\\n\\n Ben skimmed the report again and lingered over the murder weapon. The priest\u0027s scarf. There had been a note pinned next to it. He\u0027d knelt beside her himself hours before to read it.\\n\\n Her sins are forgiven her.\\n\\n \"Amen,\" Ben murmured, and let out a long breath.\\n\\n It was after one a.m. on the second week of September when Barbara Clayton cut across the lawn of the Washington Cathedral. The air was warm, the stars brilliant, but she wasn\u0027t in the mood to enjoy it. As she walked she muttered bad-temperedly. She\u0027d give that ferret-faced mechanic an earful in the morning. Fixed the transmission good as new. What a crock. Damn good thing she only had a couple more blocks to walk. Now she\u0027d have to take the bus to work. The ugly, grease-smeared sonofabitch was going to pay. A shooting star exploded and trailed across the sky in a brilliant arch. She never even noticed.\\n\\n Nor did the man who watched her. He\u0027d known she\u0027d come. Hadn\u0027t he been told to keep watch? Wasn\u0027t his head, even now, almost bursting from the pressure of the Voice? He\u0027d been chosen, given the burden and the glory.\\n\\n \"Dominus vobiscum,\" he murmured, then gripped the smooth material of the amice tightly in his hands.\\n\\n And when his task was complete, he felt the hot rush of power. His loins exploded. His blood sang. He was clean. And so, now, was she. Slowly, gently, he ran his thumb over her forehead, her lips, her heart, in the sign of the cross. He gave her absolution, but quickly. The Voice had warned him there were many who wouldn\u0027t understand the purity of the work he did.\\n\\n Leaving her body in the shadows, he walked on, eyes bright with the tears of joy and madness.\\n\\n \"The media\u0027s crawling up our backs with this one.\" Captain Harris slammed a fist on the newspaper spread over his desk. \"The whole goddamn city\u0027s in a panic. When I find out who leaked this priest business to the press...\"\\n\\n He trailed off, drawing himself in. It wasn\u0027t often he came that close to losing control. He might sit behind a desk, but he was a cop, he told himself, a damn good one. A good cop didn\u0027t lose control. To give himself time, he folded the paper, letting his gaze drift over the other cops in the room. Damn good ones, Harris admitted. He wouldn\u0027t have tolerated less.\\n\\n Ben Paris sat on the corner of the desk, toying with a Lucite paperweight. Harris knew him well enough to understand that Ben liked something in his hands when he was thinking. Young, Harris reflected, but seasoned with ten years on the force. A solid cop, if a bit loose on procedure. The two citations for bravery had been well earned. When things were less tense, it even amused Harris that Ben looked like the Hollywood screenwriter\u0027s version of an undercover cop-lean-faced, strong-boned, dark, and wiry. His hair was full and too long to be conventional, but it was cut in one of those fancy little shops in Georgetown. He had pale green eyes that didn\u0027t miss what was important.\\n\\n In a chair, three feet of leg spread out before him, sat Ed Jackson, Ben\u0027s partner. At six-five and two hundred fifty pounds, he could usually intimidate a suspect on sight. Whether by whim or design, he wore a full beard that was as red as the curly mane of hair on his head. His eyes were blue and friendly. At fifty yards he could put a hole in the eagle of a quarter with his Police Special.\\n\\n Harris set the paper aside, but didn\u0027t sit. \"What\u0027ve you got?\"\\n\\n Ben tossed the paperweight from hand to hand before he set it down. \"Other than build and coloring, there\u0027s no connection between the two victims. No mutual friends, no mutual hangouts.\\n\\n You\u0027ve got the rundown on Carla Johnson. Barbara Clayton worked in a dress shop, divorced, no kids. Family lives in Maryland, blue collar. She\u0027d been seeing someone pretty heavily up to three months ago. Things fizzled, he moved to L.A. We\u0027re checking on him, but he looks clean.\"\\n\\n He reached in his pocket for a cigarette and caught his partner\u0027s eye.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s six,\" Ed said easily. \"Ben\u0027s trying to get under a pack a day,\" he explained, then took up the report himself.\\n\\n \"Clayton spent the evening in a bar on Wisconsin. Kind of a girls\u0027 night out with a friend who works with her. Friend says Clayton left about one. Her car was found broken down a couple blocks from the hit. Seems she\u0027s been having transmission problems. Apparently, she decided to walk from there. Her apartment\u0027s only about half a mile away.\"\\n\\n \"The only things the victims had in common were that they were both blond, white, and female.\" Ben drew in smoke hard, let it fill up his lungs, then released it. \"Now they\u0027re dead.\"\\n\\n In his territory, Harris thought, and took it personally. \"The murder weapon, the priest\u0027s scarf.\"\\n\\n \"Amice,\" Ben supplied. \"Didn\u0027t seem too hard to trace. Our guy uses the best-silk.\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t get it in the city,\" Ed continued. \"Not in the past year anyway. We\u0027ve checked every religious store, every church. Got a line on three outlets in New England that carry that type.\"\\n\\n \"The notes were written on paper available at any dime store,\" Ben added. \"There\u0027s no tracing them.\"\\n\\n \"In other words, you\u0027ve got nothing.\"\\n\\n \"In any words,\" Ben drew smoke again, \"we\u0027ve got nothing.\"\\n\\n Harris studied each man in silence. He might have wished Ben would wear a tie or that Ed would trim down his beard, but that was personal. They were his best. Paris, with his easygoing charm and surface carelessness, had the instincts of a fox and a mind as sharp as a stiletto. Jackson was as thorough and efficient as a maiden aunt. A case was a jigsaw puzzle to him, and he never tired of shifting through the pieces.\\n\\n Harris sniffed the smoke from Ben\u0027s cigarette, then reminded himself that he\u0027d given up smoking for his own good. \"Go back and talk to everyone again. Get me the report on Clayton\u0027s old boyfriend and the customer lists from the religious outlets.\" He glanced toward the paper again. \"I want to take this guy down.\"\\n\\n \"The Priest,\" Ben murmured as he skimmed the headline. \"The press always likes to give psychos a title.\"\\n\\n \"And lots of coverage,\" Harris added. \"Let\u0027s get him out of the headlines and behind bars.\"\\n\\n Hazy after a long night of paperwork, Dr. Teresa Court sipped coffee and skimmed the Post. A full week after the second murder and the Priest, as the press termed him, was still at large. She didn\u0027t find reading about him the best way to begin her day, but professionally he interested her. She wasn\u0027t immune to the death of two young women, but she\u0027d been trained to look at facts and diagnose. Her life had been dedicated to it.\\n\\n Professionally, her life was besieged by problems, pain, frustrations. To compensate, she kept her private world organized and simple. Because she\u0027d grown up with the cushion of wealth and education, she took the Matisse print on her wall and the Baccarat crystal on the table as a matter of course. She preferred clean lines and pastels, but now and again found herself drawn to something jarring, like the abstract oil in vivid strokes and arrogant colors over her table. She understood her need for the harsh as well as the soft, and was content. One of her top priorities was to remain content.\\n\\n Because the coffee was already cold, she pushed it aside. After a moment she pushed the paper away as well. She wished she knew more about the killer and the victims, had all the details. Then she remembered the old saying about being careful what you wished for because you just might get it. With a quick check of her watch, she rose from the table. She didn\u0027t have time to brood over a story in the paper. She had patients to see.\\n\\n Eastern cities are at their most splendid in the fall. Summer bakes them, winter leaves them stalled and dingy, but autumn gives them a blast of color and dignity.\\n\\n At two A.M. on a cool October morning Ben Paris found himself suddenly and completely awake. There was no use wondering what had disturbed his sleep and the interesting dream involving three blondes. Rising, he padded naked to his dresser and groped for his cigarettes. Twenty-two, he counted silently.\\n\\n He lit one, letting the familiar bitter taste fill his mouth before he went to the kitchen to make coffee. Turning on only the fluorescent light on the stove, he kept a sharp eye out for roaches. Nothing skidded into cracks. Ben set the flame under the pot and thought the last extermination was still holding. As he reached for a cup he pushed away two days\u0027 worth of mail he\u0027d yet to open.\\n\\n In the harsh kitchen light his face looked hard, even dangerous. But then, he was thinking about murder. His naked body was loose and rangy, with a leanness that would have been gaunt without the subtle ridges of muscle.\\n\\n The coffee wouldn\u0027t keep him awake. When his mind was ready, his body would just follow suit. He\u0027d trained himself through endless stakeouts.\\n\\n A scrawny dust-colored cat leaped on the table and stared at him as he sipped and smoked. Noting he was distracted, the cat readjusted her idea about a late-night saucer of milk and sat down to wash.\\n\\n They were no closer to finding the killer than they had been the afternoon the first body was discovered. If they\u0027d come upon something remotely resembling a lead, it had fizzled after the first miles of legwork. Dead end, Ben reflected. Zero. Zilch.\\n\\n Of course, there had been five confessions in one month alone. All from the disturbed minds that craved attention. Twenty-six days after the second murder and they were nowhere. And every day that went by, he knew, the trail grew colder. As the press petered out, people began to relax. He didn\u0027t like it. Lighting one cigarette from the butt of another, Ben thought of calm before storms. He looked out into the cool night lit by a half-moon and wondered.\\n\\n Doug\u0027s was only five miles from Ben\u0027s apartment. The little club was dark now. The musicians were gone and the spilled booze mopped up. Francie Bowers stepped out the back entrance and drew on her sweater. Her feet hurt. After six hours on four-inch heels her toes were cramping inside her sneakers. Still, the tips had been worth it. Working as a cocktail waitress might keep you on your feet, but if your legs were good-and hers were-the tips rolled in.\\n\\n A few more nights like this one, she mused, and she might just be able to put a down payment on that little VW. No more hassling with the bus. That was her idea of heaven.\\n\\n The arch of her foot gave out a sweet sliver of pain. Wincing at it, Francie glanced at the alley. It would save her a quarter mile. But it was dark. She took another two steps toward the streetlight and gave up. Dark or not, she wasn\u0027t walking one step more than she had to.\\n\\n He\u0027d been waiting a long time. But he\u0027d known. The Voice had said one of the lost ones was being sent. She was coming quickly, as if eager to reach salvation. For days he had prayed for her, for the cleansing of her soul. Now the time of forgiveness was almost at hand. He was only an instrument.\\n\\n The turmoil began in his head and spiraled down. Power rolled into him. In the shadows he prayed until she passed by.\\n\\n He moved swiftly, as was merciful. When the amice was looped around her neck, she had only an instant to gasp before he pulled it taut. She let out a small liquid sound as her air was cut off. As terror rammed into her she dropped her canvas bag and grabbed for the restriction with both hands.\\n\\n Sometimes, when his power was great, he could let them go quickly. But the evil in her was strong, challenging him. Her fingers pulled at the silk, then dug heavily into the gloves he wore. When she kicked back, he lifted her from her feet, but she continued to lash out. One of her feet connected with a can and sent it clattering. The noise echoed in his head until he nearly screamed with it.\\n\\n Then she was limp, and the tears on his face dried in the autumn air. He laid her gently on the concrete and absolved her in the old tongue. After pinning the note to her sweater, he blessed her.\\n\\n She was at peace. And for now, so was he.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no reason to kill us getting there.\" Ed\u0027s tone of voice was serene as Ben took the Mustang around a corner at fifty. \"She\u0027s already dead.\"\\n\\n Ben downshifted and took the next right. \"You\u0027re the one who totaled the last car. My last car,\" he added without too much malice. \"Only had seventy-five thousand miles on it.\"\\n\\n \"High-speed pursuit,\" Ed mumbled.\\n\\n The Mustang shimmied over a bump, reminding Ben that he\u0027d been meaning to check the shocks.\\n\\n \"And I didn\u0027t kill you.\"\\n\\n \"Contusions and lacerations.\" Sliding through an amber light, Ben drove it into third. \"Multiple contusions and lacerations.\"\\n\\n Reminiscently, Ed smiled. \"We got them, didn\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n \"They were unconscious.\" Ben squealed to a halt at the curb and pocketed the keys. \"And I needed five stitches in my arm.\"\\n\\n \"Bitch, bitch, bitch.\" With a yawn Ed unfolded himself from the car and stood on the sidewalk.\\n\\n It was barely dawn, and cool enough so you could see your breath, but a crowd was already forming. Hunched in his jacket and wishing for coffee, Ben worked his way through the curious onlookers to the roped-off alley.\\n\\n \"Sly.\" With a nod to the police photographer, Ben looked down on victim number three.\\n\\n He would put her age at twenty-six to twenty-eight. The sweater was a cheap polyester, and the soles of her sneakers were worn almost smooth. She wore dangling, gold-plated earrings. Her face was a mask of heavy makeup that didn\u0027t suit the department-store sweater and corduroys.\\n\\n Cupping his hands around his second cigarette of the day, he listened to the report of the uniformed cop beside him.\\n\\n \"Vagrant found her. We got him in a squad car sobering up. Seems he was picking through the trash when he came across her. Put the fear of God into him, so he ran out of the alley and nearly into my cruiser.\"\\n\\n Ben nodded, looking down at the neatly lettered note pinned to her sweater. Frustration and fury moved through him so swiftly that when acceptance settled in, they were hardly noticed. Bending down, Ed picked up the oversized canvas bag she\u0027d dropped. A handful of bus tokens spilled out.\\n\\n It was going to be a long day.\\n\\n Six hours later they walked into the precinct. Homicide didn\u0027t have the seamy glamor of Vice, but it was hardly as neat and tidy as the stations in the suburbs. Two years before, the walls had been painted in what Ben referred to as apartment-house beige. The floor tiles sweat in the summer and held the cold in the winter. No matter how diligent the janitorial service was with pine cleaner and dust rags, the rooms forever smelled of stale smoke, wet coffee grounds, and fresh sweat. True, they\u0027d taken up a pool in the spring and delegated one of the detectives to buy some plants to put on the windowsills. They weren\u0027t dying, but they weren\u0027t nourishing either.\\n\\n Ben passed a desk and nodded to Lou Roderick as the detective typed up a report. This was a cop who took his caseload steadily, the way an accountant takes corporate taxes.\\n\\n \"Harris wants to see you,\" Lou told him, and without looking up, managed to convey a touch of sympathy. \"Just got in from a meeting with the mayor. And I think Lowenstein took a message for you.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\" Ben eyed the Snickers bar on Roderick\u0027s desk. \"Hey, Lou-\"\\n\\n \"Forget it.\" Roderick continued to type his report without breaking rhythm.\\n\\n \"So much for brotherhood,\" Ben muttered, and sauntered over to Lowenstein.\\n\\n She was a different type from Roderick altogether, Ben mused. She worked in surges, stop and go, and was more comfortable on the street than at a typewriter. Ben respected Lou\u0027s preciseness, but as a backup he\u0027d have chosen Lowenstein, whose proper suits and trim dresses didn\u0027t hide the fact that she had the best legs in the department. Ben took a quick look at them before he sat on the corner of her desk. Too bad she was married, he thought.\\n\\n Poking idly through her papers, he waited for her to finish her call. \"How\u0027s it going, Lowenstein?\"\\n\\n \"My garbage disposal\u0027s throwing up and the plumber wants three hundred, but that\u0027s all right because my husband\u0027s going to fix it.\" She spun a form into her typewriter. \"It\u0027ll only cost us twice as much that way. How about you?\" She smacked his hand away from the Pepsi on her desk. \"Got anything new on our priest?\"\\n\\n \"Just a corpse.\" If there was bitterness, it was hard to detect. \"Ever been to Doug\u0027s, down by the Canal?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have your social life, Paris.\"\\n\\n He gave a quick snort then picked up the fat mug that held her pencils. \"She was a cocktail waitress there. Twenty-seven.\"\\n\\n \"No use letting it get to you,\" she murmured, then seeing his face, passed him the Pepsi. It always got to you. \"Harris wants to see you and Ed.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know.\" He took a long swallow, letting the sugar and caffeine pour into his system. \"Got a message for me?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah.\" With a smirk, she pushed through her papers until she found it. \"Bunny called.\" When the high, breathy voice didn\u0027t get a rise out of him, she sent him an arch look and handed him the paper. \"She wants to know what time you\u0027re picking her up. She sounded real cute, Paris.\"\\n\\n He pocketed the slip and grinned. \"She is real cute, Lowenstein, but I\u0027d dump her in a minute if you wanted to cheat on your husband.\"\\n\\n When he walked off without returning her drink, she laughed and went back to typing out the form.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re turning my apartment into condos.\" Ed hung up the phone and went with Ben toward Harris\u0027s office. \"Fifty thousand. Jesus.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s got bad plumbing.\" Ben drained the rest of the Pepsi and tossed it into a can.\\n\\n \"Yeah. Got any vacancies over at your place?\"\\n\\n \"Nobody leaves there unless they die.\"\\n\\n Through the wide glass window of Harris\u0027s office they could see the captain standing by his desk as he talked on the phone. He\u0027d kept himself in good shape for a man of fifty-seven who\u0027d spent the last ten years behind a desk. He had too much willpower to run to fat. His first marriage had gone under because of the job, his second because of the bottle. Harris had given up booze and marriage, and now the job took the place of both. The cops in his department didn\u0027t necessarily like him, but they respected him. Harris preferred things that way. Glancing up, he signaled for both men to enter.\\n\\n \"I want the lab reports before five. If there was a piece of lint on her sweater, I want to know where it came from. Do your job. Give me something to work with so I can do mine.\" When he hung up, he went over to his hot plate and poured coffee. After five years he still wished it were scotch. \"Tell me about Francie Bowers.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s been working tables at Doug\u0027s for almost a year. Moved to D.C. from Virginia last November. Lived alone in an apartment in North West.\" Ed shifted his weight and checked his notebook. \"Married twice, neither lasted over a year. We\u0027re checking out both exes. She worked nights and slept days, so her neighbors don\u0027t know much about her. She got off work at one. Apparently she cut through the alley to get to the bus stop. She didn\u0027t own a car.\"\\n\\n \"Nobody heard anything,\" Ben added. \"Or saw anything.\"\\n\\n \"Ask again,\" Harris said simply. \"And find someone who did. Anything more on number one?\"\\n\\n Ben didn\u0027t like victims by numbers, and stuck his hands in his pockets. \"Carla Johnson\u0027s boyfriend\u0027s in L.A., got a bit part on a soap. He\u0027s clean. It appeared she\u0027d had an argument with another student the day before she was killed. Witnesses said it got pretty hot.\"\\n\\n \"He admitted it,\" Ed continued. \"Seems they\u0027d dated a couple of times and she wasn\u0027t interested.\"\\n\\n \"Alibi?\"\\n\\n \"Claims he got drunk and picked up a freshman.\" With a shrug, Ben sat on the arm of a chair. \"They\u0027re engaged. We can bring him in again, but neither of us believe he had anything to do with it. He\u0027s got no connection with Clayton or Bowers. When we checked him over, we found out that the kid\u0027s the ail-American boy from an upper-middle-class family. Lettered in track. It\u0027s more likely Ed\u0027s a psychotic than that college boy.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, partner.\"\\n\\n \"Well, check him out again anyway. What\u0027s his name?\"\\n\\n \"Robert Lawrence Dors. He drives a Honda Civic and wears polo shirts.\" Ben drew out a cigarette. \"White loafers and no socks.\"\\n\\n \"Roderick\u0027ll bring him in.\"\\n\\n \"Wait a minute-\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m assigning a task force to this business,\" Harris said, cutting Ben off. He poured a second cup of coffee. \"Roderick, Lowenstein, and Bigsby\u0027ll be working with you. I want this guy before he kills the next woman who happens to be out walking alone.\" His voice remained mild, reasonable, and final. \"You have a problem with that?\"\\n\\n Ben strode to the window and stared out. It was personal, and he knew better. \"No, we all want him.\"\\n\\n \"Including the mayor,\" Harris added with only the slightest trace of bitterness. \"He wants to be able to give the press something positive by the end of the week. We\u0027re calling in a psychiatrist to give us a profile.\"\\n\\n \"A shrink?\" With a half laugh, Ben turned around. \"Come on, Captain.\"\\n\\n Because he didn\u0027t like it either, Harris\u0027s voice chilled. \"Dr. Court has agreed to cooperate with us, at the mayor\u0027s request. We don\u0027t know what he looks like, maybe it\u0027s time we found out how he thinks. At this point,\" he added with a level glance at both men, \"I\u0027m willing to look into a crystal ball if we\u0027d get a lead out of it. Be here at four.\"\\n\\n Ben started to open his mouth then caught Ed\u0027s warning glance. Without a word they strode out. \"Maybe we should call in a psychic,\" Ben muttered.\\n\\n \" Close-minded.\"\\n\\n \"Realistic.\"\\n\\n \"The human psyche is a fascinating mystery.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been reading again.\"\\n\\n \"And those trained to understand it can open doors layman only knock against.\"\\n\\n Ben sighed and flicked his cigarette into the parking lot as they stepped outside. \"Shit.\"\\n\\n \"Shit,\" Tess muttered as she glanced out her office window. There were two things she had no desire to do at that moment. The first was battling traffic in the cold, nasty rain that had begun to fall. The second was to become involved with the homicides plaguing the city. She was going to have to do the first because the mayor, and her grandfather, had pressured her to do the second.\\n\\n Her caseload was already too heavy. She might have refused the mayor, politely, even apologetically. Her grandfather was a different matter. She never felt like Dr. Teresa Court when she dealt with him. After five minutes she wasn\u0027t five feet four with a woman\u0027s body and a black-framed degree behind her. She was again a skinny twelve-year-old, overpowered by the personality of the man she loved most in the world.\\n\\n He\u0027d seen to it that she\u0027d gotten that black-framed degree, hadn\u0027t he? With his confidence, she thought, his support, his unstinting belief in her. How could she say no when he asked her to use her skill? Because handling her current caseload took her ten hours a day. Perhaps it was time she stopped being stubborn and took on a partner.\\n\\n Tess looked around her pastel office with its carefully selected antiques and watercolors. Hers, she thought. Every bit of it. And she glanced at the tall, oak file cabinet, circa 1920. It was loaded with case files. Those were hers too. No, she wouldn\u0027t be taking on a partner. In a year she\u0027d be thirty. She had her own practice, her own office, her own problems. That\u0027s just the way she wanted to keep it.\\n\\n Taking the mink-lined raincoat from the closet, she shrugged into it. And maybe, just maybe, she could help the police find the man who was splashed across the headlines day after day. She could help them find him, stop him, so that he in turn could get the help he needed.\\n\\n She picked up her purse and the briefcase, which was fat with files to be sorted through that evening. \"Kate.\" Stepping into her outer office, Tess turned up her collar. \"I\u0027m on my way to Captain Harris\u0027s office. Don\u0027t pass anything through unless it\u0027s urgent.\"\\n\\n \"You should have a hat,\" the receptionist answered.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got one in the car. See you tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Drive carefully.\"\\n\\n Already thinking ahead, she walked through the door while digging for her car keys. Maybe she could grab some take-out Chinese on the way home and have a quiet dinner before-\\n\\n \"Tess!\"\\n\\n One more step and she would have been in the elevator. Swearing under her breath, Tess turned and managed a smile. \"Frank.\" And she\u0027d been so successful at avoiding him for nearly ten days.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a hard lady to pin down.\"\\n\\n He strode toward her. Impeccable. That was the word that always leaped to Tess\u0027s mind when she saw Dr. F. R. Fuller. Right before boring. His suit was pearl-gray Brooks Brothers, and his striped tie had hints of that shade and the baby pink in his Arrow shirt. His hair was perfectly and conservatively groomed. She tried hard to keep her smile from fading. It wasn\u0027t Frank\u0027s fault she couldn\u0027t warm to perfection.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been busy.\"\\n\\n \"You know what they say about all work, Tess.\"\\n\\n She gritted her teeth to keep herself from saying no, what did they say? He\u0027d simply laugh and give her the rest of the cliche. \"I\u0027ll just have to risk it.\" She pressed the button for down and hoped the car came quickly.\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re leaving early today.\"\\n\\n \"Outside appointment.\" Deliberately she checked her watch. She had time to spare. \"Running a bit late,\" she lied without qualm.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been trying to get in touch with you.\" Pressing his palm against the wall, he leaned over her. Another of his habits Tess found herself detesting. \"You\u0027d think it wouldn\u0027t be a problem since our offices are right next door.\"\\n\\n Where the hell was an elevator when you needed it? \"You know what schedules are like, Frank.\"\\n\\n \"Indeed I do.\" He flashed his toothpaste smile and she wondered if he thought his cologne was driving her wild. \"But we all need to relax now and again, right, Doctor?\"\\n\\n \"In our own way.\"\\n\\n \"I have tickets to the Noel Coward play at the Kennedy Center tomorrow night. Why don\u0027t we relax together?\"\\n\\n The last time, the only time, she\u0027d agreed to relax with him, she\u0027d barely escaped with the clothes on her back. Worse, before the tug-of-war, she\u0027d been bored to death for three hours. \"It\u0027s nice of you to think of me, Frank.\" Again she lied without hesitation. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m already booked for tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t we-\"\\n\\n The doors opened. \"Oops, I\u0027m late.\" Sending him a cheery smile, she stepped inside. \"Don\u0027t work too hard, Frank. You know what they say.\"\\n\\n Due to the pounding rain and traffic she ate up nearly all of her extra time driving to the station house. Strangely enough, the half-hour battle left her rather cheerful. Perhaps, she thought, because she had escaped so neatly from Frank. If she\u0027d had the heart, and she didn\u0027t, she would simply have told him he was a jerk and that would be the end of it. Until he pushed her into enough corners, she\u0027d use tact and excuses.\\n\\n Reaching beside her, she picked up a felt hat and bundled her hair under it. She glanced in the rearview mirror and wrinkled her nose. No use doing any repairs now. The rain would make it a waste of time. Still, there was bound to be a ladies room inside where she could dig into her bag of tricks and come out looking dignified and professional. For now she was just going to look wet.\\n\\n Pushing open the door of the car, Tess grabbed her hat with one hand and made a dash for the building.\\n\\n \"Check this out.\" Ben halted his partner on the steps leading to headquarters. They watched, heedless of the rain, as Tess jumped over puddles.\\n\\n \"Nice legs,\" Ed commented.\\n\\n \"Damn. They\u0027re better than Lowenstein\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\" Ed gave it a moment\u0027s thought. \"Hard to tell in the rain.\"\\n\\n Still running, head down, Tess dashed up the steps and collided with Ben. He heard her swear before he took her shoulders, pulling her back just far enough to get a look at her face.\\n\\n It was worth getting wet for.\\n\\n Elegant. Even with rain washing over it, Ben thought of elegance. The slash of cheekbones was strong, high enough to make him think of Viking maidens. Her mouth was soft and moist, making him think of other things. Her skin was pale, with just a touch of rose. But it was her eyes that made him lose track of the glib remark he\u0027d thought to make. They were big, cool, and just a bit annoyed. And violet. He\u0027d thought the color had been reserved for Elizabeth Taylor and wildflowers.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" Tess managed when she got her breath back. \"I didn\u0027t see you.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" He wanted to go on staring, but managed to bring himself around. He had a reputation with women that was mythical. Exaggerated, but based on fact. \"At the rate you were traveling, I\u0027m not surprised.\" It felt good to hold her, to watch the rain cling to her lashes. \"I could run you in for assaulting an officer.\"\\n\\n \"The lady\u0027s getting wet,\" Ed murmured.\\n\\n Until then Tess had only been aware of the man who held her, staring at her as though she\u0027d appeared in a puff of smoke. Now she made herself look away and over, then up. She saw a wet giant with laughing blue eyes and a mass of dripping red hair. Was this a police station, she thought, or a fairy tale?\\n\\n Ben kept one hand on her arm as he pushed open the door. He\u0027d let her inside, but he wasn\u0027t going to let her slip away. Not yet.\\n\\n Once in, Tess gave Ed another look, decided he was real, and turned to Ben. So was he. And he was still holding her arm. Amused, she lifted a brow. \"Officer, I warn you, if you arrest me for assault, I\u0027ll file charges of police brutality.\" When he smiled, she felt something click. So he wasn\u0027t as harmless as she\u0027d thought. \"Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me-\"\\n\\n \"Forget the charges.\" Ben kept his hand on her arm. \"If you need a ticket fixed-\"\\n\\n \"Sergeant-\"\\n\\n \"Detective,\" he corrected. \"Ben.\"\\n\\n \"Detective, I might take you up on that another time, but at the moment I\u0027m running late. If you want to be helpful-\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a public servant.\"\\n\\n \"Then you can let go of my arm and tell me where to find Captain Harris.\"\\n\\n \"Captain Harris? Homicide?\"\\n\\n She saw the surprise, the distrust, and felt her arm released. Intrigued, she tilted her head and removed her hat. Pale blond hair tumbled to her shoulders. \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n Ben\u0027s gaze skimmed the fall of hair before he looked back at her face. It didn\u0027t fit, he thought. He suspected things that didn\u0027t fit. \"Dr. Court?\"\\n\\n It always took an effort to meet rudeness and cynicism with grace. Tess didn\u0027t bother to make it. \"Right again-Detective.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a shrink?\"\\n\\n She gave him back look for look. \"You\u0027re a cop?\"\\n\\n Each might have added something less than complimentary if Ed hadn\u0027t burst out laughing. \"That\u0027s the bell for round one,\" he said easily. \"Harris\u0027s office is a neutral corner.\" He took Tesss arm himself and showed her the way. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sacred-sins/page-1.html","bookId":2413,"book":{"id":2413,"title":"Sacred Sins","description":"Storyline: Sacred Sins (D.C.
