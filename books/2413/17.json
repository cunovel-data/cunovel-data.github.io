{"id":75431,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"The surgical floor smelled of antiseptic and fresh paint. With the staff halved for the holiday, the halls were almost empty. Someone had covered a mincemeat pie in Saran Wrap and left it at the nurse\u0027s station. It looked cheerful and miserably out of place. Tess stopped there as the nurse on duty filled out a report.\n \"I\u0027m Dr. Teresa Court. Joseph Higgins, Jr., was admitted a short time ago.\"\n \"Yes, Doctor. He\u0027s in surgery.\"\n \"What\u0027s his condition?\"\n \"Massive trauma, hemorrhaging. He was comatose when they took him up. Dr. Bitterman\u0027s operating.\"\n Joeys parents?\n \"Down the end of the hall and to the left, in the waiting area, Doctor.\"\n \"Thank you.\" Steeling herself, Tess turned to Ben. \"I don\u0027t know how long this might take, and it won\u0027t be pleasant. I\u0027m sure I can arrange for you to wait in the doctor\u0027s lounge. You\u0027d be more comfortable.\"\n \"I\u0027ll go with you.\"\n \"All right.\" Unbuttoning her coat as she went, Tess started down the hall. Their footsteps sounded like gunfire in the tiled silence of the corridor. As she approached the door to the waiting area, she heard the muffled sobs.\n Lois Monroe was huddled close against her husband. Though it was overwarm in the room, neither of them had taken off their coats. She cried quietly, with her eyes open and unfocused. A Thanksgiving special danced soundlessly from the television mounted high on the wall. Tess motioned for Ben to stay back.\n \"Mr. Monroe.\"\n At the sound of her voice his eyes shifted from the wall to the door. For a moment he stared at her as if he didn\u0027t know who she was, then a seizure of pain ran through him, reflecting briefly, poignantly, in his eyes. She could almost hear the thoughts.\n I didn\u0027t believe you. I didn\u0027t understand. I didn\u0027t know.\n Responding to that even more than to the weeping, Tess went to them to sit beside Lois Monroe.\n \"She went up to see if he wanted some more pie,\" Monroe began. \"He-he was gone. There was a note.\"\n Because she understood need, Tess reached out and held his free hand. He gripped it tight, swallowed, then went on.\n \"It said he was sorry. That he-he wished he could be different. It said everything would be better now, and that he was going to come back in another life. Someone saw him...\" Monroe\u0027s fingers viced on hers while he closed his eyes and fought for control. \"Someone saw him jump and called the police. They came-they came to the house just after we realized he was gone. I didn\u0027t know what to do, so I called you.\"\n \"Joey\u0027s going to be just fine.\" With her hands kneading together, Lois shifted farther away from Tess. \"I\u0027ve always taken care of him. He\u0027s going to be fine, then we\u0027re going to go home together.\" Maintaining the distance, she turned her head enough to look at Tess. \"I told you he didn\u0027t need you anymore. Joey doesn\u0027t need you or any clinic or more treatment. He just needs to be left alone for a little while. He\u0027s going to be fine. He knows I love him.\"\n \"Yes, he knows you love him,\" Tess murmured as she took Lois\u0027s hand. The pulse was rapid and thready. \"Joey knows how hard you\u0027ve tried to make things good for him.\"\n \"I have. Everything I\u0027ve done has been to try to protect him, to try to make things better. All I\u0027ve ever wanted was for Joey to be happy.\"\n \"I know that.\"\n \"Then why? You tell me why this happened.\" Tears dried up. Her voice went from wavery to venomous. Lois struggled away from her husband to grab Tess by the shoulders. \"You were supposed to heal, you were supposed to make him well. You tell me why my boy\u0027s bleeding on that table. You tell me why.\"\n \"Lois, Lois, don\u0027t.\" Already grieving, Monroe tried to gather her close, but she sprang up, dragging Tess with her. Instinctively Ben started forward, but was stopped by a furious shake of Tess\u0027s head.\n \"I want an answer. Damn you, I want you to give me an answer!\"\n Rather than block the fury, Tess accepted it. \"He was hurting, Mrs. Monroe. And the hurt was deep, deeper than I could reach.\"\n \"I did everything I could.\" Though her voice was quiet, almost level, Lois\u0027s fingers dug deep into Tess\u0027s flesh. Bruises would show the next day. \"I did everything. He wasn\u0027t drinking,\" she said with a hitch in her voice. \"He hadn\u0027t had a drink in months.\"\n \"No, he wasn\u0027t drinking. You should sit down, Lois.\" Tess tried to ease her back on the sofa.\n \"I don\u0027t want to sit.\" Fury that was fear spewed out until each word was like a bullet. \"I want my son. I want my boy. All you did was talk and talk, week after week just talk. Why didn\u0027t you do something? You were supposed to make him better, make him happy. Why didn\u0027t you?\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t.\" In a wave, the grief washed over her. \"I couldn\u0027t.\"\n \"Lois, sit down.\" Strengthened by her need, Monroe took her by the shoulders and brought her to the sofa. As his arm went around her again, he looked at Tess. \"You told us this could happen. We didn\u0027t believe you. We didn\u0027t want to. If it\u0027s not too late, we can try again. We can-\"\n Then the door swung open, and they all knew it was too late.\n Dr. Bitterman still wore his surgical scrubs. He\u0027d pulled down his mask so that it hung by its strings. The sweat on it hadn\u0027t dried. Though his time in the operating room had been relatively brief, there were lines of strain and fatigue around his eyes and mouth. Before he spoke, before he moved over to the Monroes, Tess knew they had both lost a patient.\n \"Mrs. Monroe, I\u0027m sorry. There was nothing we could do.\"\n \"Joey?\" She looked blankly from the doctor to her husband. One hand was already clawing at Monroe\u0027s shoulder.\n \"Joey\u0027s gone, Mrs. Monroe.\" Because the hour he\u0027d spent trying to sew the boy back together had left him sick and defeated, Bitter man sat beside her. \"He never regained consciousness. He had a massive head injury. There was nothing that could be done.\"\n \"Joey? Joey\u0027s dead?\" I\u0027m sorry.\n The sobbing started, harsh, guttural sounds that poured out of her into the room. She cried with her mouth open, her head back, in an agony of grief that twisted Tess\u0027s stomach. No one could truly understand the measure of joy a mother received from giving birth to a child. No one could truly understand the devastation a mother experienced upon losing one.\n An error in judgment, a desire to keep her family whole with her own strength, had cost her her son. There was nothing Tess could do for her now. There was no longer anything she could do for Joey. With her own grief clogging her lungs, she turned and walked from the room.\n \"Tess.\" Ben caught her arm as she started down the hall. \"You aren\u0027t staying?\"\n \"No.\" Her voice was strong and icy as she continued to walk. \"Seeing me now only makes it more painful for her, if possible.\" She pushed the button for the elevator then jammed her hands into her pockets, where they curled and uncurled.\n \"That\u0027s it?\" Dull and centered in his gut, the anger began to spread. \"You just cross it off?\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing more I can do here.\" She stepped into the elevator, fighting to breathe calmly.\n It was snowing hard on the way home. Tess didn\u0027t speak. Tast-ing bitterness in his own throat, Ben remained as coldly silent as she. Though the car heater poured out warmth, she had to struggle not to shiver. Failure, grief, and anger were so twined together that it made one hard knot of emotion that wedged in her throat; she could taste it. Control was often hard won, but never so vital as it seemed to her at that moment.\n By the time they stepped into her apartment, the pressure in her chest was so strong she had to consciously school every breath. \"I\u0027m sorry you got dragged into this,\" she said carefully. She needed to get away, away from him, from everyone until she\u0027d pulled herself back together. The throbbing in her head was building to a roar. \"I know it was difficult.\"\n \"You seem to be handling it just fine.\" After yanking off his jacket, he tossed it into a chair. \"You don\u0027t have to apologize to me. I\u0027m in the business, remember?\"\n \"Yes, of course. Listen.\" She had to swallow the bubbling heat in her throat. \"I\u0027m going to have a bath.\"\n \"Sure, go ahead.\" He walked to the liquor cabinet and reached for the vodka he\u0027d stored. \"I\u0027m going to have a drink.\"\n She didn\u0027t bother to go into the bedroom to change. When the door was closed quietly behind her, Ben heard the sound of water rushing against porcelain.\n He hadn\u0027t even known the kid, Ben told himself as he splashed vodka into a glass. There was no reason for him to feel this ugly squeeze of resentment. It was one thing to feel sorrow, pity, even anger at the useless loss of a life, a young life, but there was no reason for this helpless, shaking rage.\n She\u0027d been so detached. So goddamned untouched.\n Just like Josh\u0027s doctor.\n The bitterness lodged deep for years swirled into his throat. Ben lifted the vodka to wash the taste away, then slammed it, untouched, onto the cabinet. Not sure what he was going to do, he went down the hall and pushed the bathroom door open.\n She wasn\u0027t in the tub.\n Like thunder, the water hit the porcelain full force, then whirled down the drain she hadn\u0027t bothered to close. Steam was rising, already sweating on the mirror. Fully dressed, using the sink for support, Tess wept violently into her hands.\n For a moment Ben stood silently in the open doorway, too stunned to go in, too shocked to close the door and leave her the privacy she\u0027d sought.\n He\u0027d never seen her as the helpless victim of her own emotions. In bed there were times she seemed utterly guided by her own passion. Occasionally he\u0027d seen her temper flare, teetering briefly on full blossoming. Then she snapped it back, always. Now it was grief, and the grief was total.\n She hadn\u0027t heard him open the door. Slowly, her body rocked back and forth in a rhythm of mourning. Self-comfort. Ben\u0027s throat tightened, driving back the bitterness. He started to touch her, then hesitated. It was harder, he discovered, unbelievably harder to comfort someone who really mattered.\n \"Tess.\" When he did touch her, she jolted. When his arms went around her, she went board stiff. He could feel her fighting to block off the tears, and him. \"Come on, you should sit down.\"\n \"No.\" Humiliation washed through her already weakened system. She\u0027d been caught in her lowest and most private moment, stripped naked, without the strength to cover herself. She wanted only solitude, and the time to rebuild. \"Please just leave me alone for a while.\"\n It hurt-her resistance, her rejection of the comfort he needed to give. It hurt enough that he started to draw away. Then he felt the shudder pass through her, a shudder more poignant, more pitiful than even the tears. In silence he moved over and shut off the tap.\n She\u0027d uncovered her face to wrap her fingers around the lip of the sink. Her back was ramrod straight, as if she were braced to ward off a blow or a helping hand. Drenched, her eyes met his. Her skin was already streaked and reddened from tears. He didn\u0027t say a word, didn\u0027t think of the angles as he lifted her into his arms and carried her from the room.\n He expected a struggle, some fierce and furious words. Instead her body went limp as she turned her face into his throat and let herself cry.\n \"He was just a child.\"\n Ben sat on the edge of the bed and gathered her closer. The tears were hot on his skin, as if they had burned behind her eyes for too long. \"I know.\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t reach him. I should have been able to. All the education, all the training, the self-analysis, the books and lectures, and I couldn\u0027t reach him.\"\n \"You tried.\"\n \"That\u0027s not good enough.\" The anger sprang out, full-blown and vicious, but it didn\u0027t surprise him. He\u0027d been waiting for it, hoping for it. \"I\u0027m supposed to heal. I\u0027m supposed to help, not just talk of helping. I didn\u0027t just fail to complete his treatment, I failed to keep him alive.\"\n \"Are psychiatrists required to have godlike egos?\"\n Like a slap in the face, his words jarred her away from him. In an instant she was on her feet. The tears were still drying on her face, her body still trembling, but she didn\u0027t look as though she would collapse. \"How dare you say that to me? A young boy is dead. He\u0027ll never have a chance to drive a car, to fall in love, to start a family. He\u0027s dead, and the fact that I\u0027m responsible hasn\u0027t anything to do with ego.\"\n \"Doesn\u0027t it?\" Ben rose as well, and before she could turn away, took her shoulders. \"You\u0027re supposed to be perfect, always in control, always having the answers, the solutions? This time you didn\u0027t have them and you weren\u0027t quite indestructible. You tell me, could you have stopped him from going to that bridge?\"\n \"I should\u0027ve been able to.\" The sob was dry and shaky as she pressed the heel of her hand between her brows. \"No. No, I couldn\u0027t give him enough.\"\n With his arm around her again, he drew her back to the bed. For the first time in their relationship he felt needed, leaned on. In the normal course of events it would have been his cue to make for the door. Instead he sat with her, taking her hand as her head rested on his shoulder. Complete. It was odd and a little frightening to feel complete.\n \"Tess, this is the boy you told me about before, isn\u0027t it?\"\n She remembered the night of her dream, the night she\u0027d woken to find Ben warm, and willing to listen. \"Yes. I\u0027ve been worried about what he might do for weeks.\"\n \"And you told his parents?\"\n \"Yes, I told them, but-\"\n \"They didn\u0027t want to hear it.\"\n \"It shouldn\u0027t have made any difference. I should have been able to-\" She broke off when he turned her face to his. \"No,\" she said on a long breath, \"they didn\u0027t want to hear it. His mother pulled him out of therapy.\"\n \"And cut the strings.\"\n \"It might have pushed him a bit farther inward, but I don\u0027t think it was the final factor that drove him to suicide.\" The grief was still there, cold and hard in her stomach, but her mind was clearing enough for her to see past her own involvement. \"I think something else happened tonight.\"\n \"And you think you know what it was?\"\n \"Maybe.\" She rose again, unable to sit. \"I\u0027ve been trying to contact Joey\u0027s father for weeks. His phones disconnected. I even went by his apartment a few days ago, but he\u0027d moved without leaving a forwarding address. He was supposed to spend this weekend with Joey.\" Tess rubbed tears from her cheeks with the backs of her hands. \"Joey had been counting on it, too heavily. When his father didn\u0027t come for him, it was another brick on his back. Maybe the last one he could carry. He was a beautiful boy, a young man really.\" Fresh tears started, but this time the grief loosened and came clean. \"He\u0027d had such a tough time, and yet there was this warmth just under the surface, this great need to be loved. He just didn\u0027t believe he deserved to have anyone really care about him.\"\n \"And you cared.\"\n \"Yes. Maybe too much.\"\n It was strange, but the small, hard ball of resentment coated with a thin layer of bitterness that he\u0027d carried in his gut since his brother\u0027s death began to break apart. He looked at her-the aloof, the objective psychiatrist, the poker and prodder of minds-and saw the real and human scars of grief, not just for the patient, but for the boy.\n \"Tess, what his mother said back at the hospital...\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter.\"\n \"Yes, it does. She was wrong.\"\n Tess turned away, and in the dim light from the hallway saw her own reflection in the mirror above her dresser. \"Only partly. You see, I\u0027ll never know that if I\u0027d pushed in a different direction, tried another angle, whether it would have made a difference.\"\n \"She was wrong,\" Ben repeated. \"A few years ago I said some of those same things. Maybe I was wrong too.\"\n In the glass her gaze shifted and met his. He was still sitting on the bed, in the shadows. He looked alone. It was strange, because she had considered him a man constantly surrounded by friends, good feelings, his own self-confidence. She turned, but not certain he wanted her to reach out, remained where she was.\n \"I\u0027ve never told you about Josh, my brother.\"\n \"No. You\u0027ve never told me much about your family. I didn\u0027t know you had a brother.\"\n \"He was almost four years older than me.\" It didn\u0027t take the use of the past tense to tell her Josh was dead. She\u0027d known it as soon as Ben had said the name. \"He was one of those people who have gold on the ends of their fingers. No matter what he did, he did it better than anyone else. When we were kids we had this set of Tinker Toys. I\u0027d built a little car, Josh would build a sixteen-wheeler. In school I\u0027d maybe pull a B if I studied until my eyes dropped out. Josh would ace a test without opening a book. He just absorbed. My mother used to say he was blessed. She kept hoping he\u0027d be a priest, because once he was ordained, he\u0027d probably be able to perform miracles.\"\n It wasn\u0027t said with the resentment many siblings might have felt, but with a trace of humor, and more than a little admiration.\n \"You must have loved him very much.\"\n \"Sometimes I hated him.\" It was said with a shrug, from a man who understood that hate was often the heat that tempered real love. \"But mostly yes, I thought he was terrific. He never bullied me, not that he couldn\u0027t have. He was a hell of a lot bigger, but he just didn\u0027t have that kind of temperament. Not that he was holy or anything. He was good, just basically, deep down good.\n \"We shared a room when we were growing up. Once Mom found my stash of Playboys. She was prepared to whale the lust as well as the tar out of me. Josh told her they were his, that he was doing a report on pornography and its sociological effects on teenagers.\"\n Unable to resist, Tess laughed. \"And she bought it?\"\n \"Yeah, she bought it.\" Even now, remembering made him grin. \"Josh never lied to cover his own ass, only when he thought it was the best thing to do. In high school he was quarterback on the football team. The girls all but threw themselves on the ground in front of him. He was healthy enough to get some pleasure out of that, but he fell hard for one girl. It was like him to focus in on one instead of, well, picking the tree dry. Still, she was the one big mistake I ever thought he made. She was gorgeous, smart, and from one of the better families. She was also shallow. But he was crazy in love, and in his senior year he took his savings and bought her a diamond. Not just a little chip, but a real rock. She used to go around flashing it to make the other girls drool.\n \"They fought about something. He never would say what it was, but it was a real fallout. Josh had an academic scholarship to Notre Dame, but the day after graduation he enlisted in the Army. Kids were protesting \u0027Nam, smoking pot, and wearing peace signs, but Josh decided to give his country a few years of his time.\"\n For the first time since he\u0027d begun, Ben reached for and lit a cigarette. The tip glowed red in the shadowed light that fell over him. \"My mother cried buckets, but my father was bust-button proud. His son wasn\u0027t a draft dodger or a pot-headed college student, but a real American. My fathers a simple man, that\u0027s the way he thought. For myself, I leaned more toward the left. I\u0027d be starting high school myself in the fall, so I figured I already knew about everything I needed to know. I spent an all-night session with Josh trying to talk him out of it. Of course, the papers were signed and it was too late, but I figured there must be a way out. I told him he was stupid to toss three years of his life away because of a girl. The trouble was, it had gone beyond that. As soon as Josh had enlisted, he\u0027d decided he was going to be the best soldier in the United States Army. They\u0027d already talked to him about Officer\u0027s Training. The way Johnson was escalating things over there, we needed smart, capable officers leading the troops. That\u0027s how Josh saw himself.\"\n She heard it then, the splinter of pain that worked its way into his voice. Leaving the light for the shadows, Tess went to him. He hadn\u0027t realized he\u0027d needed it, but when her hand touched his, Ben held on.\n \"So he went.\" He drew deep on his cigarette and let smoke out with a sigh. \"He got on the bus, young, I guess you could say beautiful, idealistic, confident. From his letters it seemed he was thriving in Basic. It was the discipline, the challenge, the camaraderie. He made friends easily, and it wasn\u0027t any different there. He got his orders for \u0027Nam less than a year later. I was in high school bluffing my way through Algebra and finding out how many cheerleaders I could rack up. Josh shipped out a Second Lieutenant.\"\n He lapsed into silence. Tess sat beside him, his hand in hers, waiting for him to go on.\n \"My mother went to church every day he was over there. She used to go in and light a candle then pray to the Blessed Virgin to intercede to her Son for Josh\u0027s safety. Every time she got a letter, she\u0027d read it until she knew every word. But it didn\u0027t take long for the letters to change. They got shorter, the tone was different. He stopped mentioning his friends. We didn\u0027t know until later that two of his best buddies had been splattered all over the jungle. We didn\u0027t know that until he\u0027d come back and started having nightmares. He didn\u0027t get killed over there. My mother must have lit enough candles for that, but he died. The part of him that made him what he was died. I need a drink.\"\n Before he could rise, Tess put a hand to his arm. \"I\u0027ll get it.\" She left him, and wanting to give him the time he needed, poured two warming brandies. When she went back in, he\u0027d lit another cigarette, but hadn\u0027t moved.\n \"Thanks.\" He drank, and found that while the brandy didn\u0027t fill the hole grief had left, it no longer had to bypass that ball of bitterness. \"Nobody was giving hero\u0027s welcomes back then. The war had turned sour. Josh came back with medals, commendations, and a time bomb in his head. It seemed okay for a while. He was quiet, withdrawn, but we figured nobody could come through that without some change. He moved back into the house, got a job. He didn\u0027t want to talk about going back to school. We all figured, well, he just needs some time.\n \"It took almost a year before the nightmares started. He\u0027d wake up screaming and sweating. He lost his job. He told us he\u0027d quit, but Dad found out he\u0027d picked a fight and gotten himself fired. It took about another year before things really deteriorated. He couldn\u0027t keep a job for more than a few weeks. He started coming home drunk, or not coming home at all. The nightmares got violent. One night I tried to bring him out of one and he knocked me across the room. He started shouting about ambush and snipers. When I stood up and tried to calm him down, he came at me. When my father came in, Josh was strangling me.\"\n \"Oh, God, Ben.\"\n \"Dad managed to bring him out, and when he realized what he\u0027d done, what he\u0027d almost done, Josh just sat down on the floor and cried. I\u0027ve never seen anyone cry like that. He couldn\u0027t stop. We took him to the V.A. They assigned him a psychiatrist.\"\n The ash on his cigarette had grown long. Crushing it out, Ben went back to the brandy. \"I was in college by then, so I\u0027d drive him sometimes when I had a light afternoon schedule. I hated that office; it always made me think of a tomb. Josh would go in. Sometimes you could hear him crying. Other times you couldn\u0027t hear anything at all. Fifty minutes later he\u0027d come out. I kept waiting for him to walk out that door one day and be the way I remembered.\"\n \"Sometimes it\u0027s as hard, even harder on the family, than it is on the one who\u0027s ill,\" Tess said, keeping her hand near his, letting him take or reject the contact. \"You feel helpless when you want so badly to help... confused when you need so badly to think clearly.\"\n \"My mother broke down one day. It was a Sunday. She\u0027d been fixing a pot roast. All of a sudden she just dumped it all in the sink.\n If it was cancer, she said, they\u0027d find a way to cut it out of him. Can\u0027t they see what\u0027s inside him is eating him up? Why don\u0027t they find a way to cut it out of him?\"\n He stared down into his brandy, the image of his mother standing over the sink, sobbing, as clear as if it had happened yesterday.\n \"For a while he really seemed to get better. Because he was under psychiatric care and his job record was shaky, it was hard for him to find work. Our pastor applied a little pressure, some good old-fashioned Catholic guilt, and got him a job at a local gas station as a mechanic. He\u0027d had a scholarship to Notre Dame five years before, and now he was changing spark plugs. Still, it was something. The nightmares slowed down. None of us knew he was eating barbituates to keep them that way. Then it was heroin. That got by us too. Maybe if I\u0027d been home more, but I was in college, and for the first time in my life serious about making it work. My parents were totally naive about drugs. It got by the doctor too. He was a major, regular Army, had done a tour of Korea and \u0027Nam, but he didn\u0027t see that Josh was pumping himself full of smack to get through the night.\"\n Ben dragged a hand through his hair before he finished off the brandy. \"I don\u0027t know, maybe the guy was overworked, or maybe he burned out. Anyway, the upshot was, after two years of therapy, after thousands of candles and prayers to the Blessed Virgin, Josh went up to his room, put on his combat fatigues and his medals, and instead of picking up his syringe, loaded his service revolver and ended it.\"\n \"Ben, saying I\u0027m sorry isn\u0027t enough, isn\u0027t nearly enough, but there\u0027s nothing else I can say.\"\n \"He was only twenty-four.\"\n And you\u0027d have been only twenty, she thought, but rather than say it, put her arm around him.\n \"I thought about blaming the whole U.S. Army-better yet, the entire military system. I figured it made more sense to focus on the doctor who was supposed to be helping him. I remember sitting there when the police were upstairs, in the room I\u0027d shared with Josh, and thinking that the bastard was supposed to do something.\n He was supposed to make him better. I even thought about killing him for a while, then the priest came and distracted me. He wouldn\u0027t give Josh last rites.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t our pastor, but this young, straight-out-of-the-seminary rookie who turned green at the thought of going upstairs to Josh. He said Josh had willingly and knowingly taken his life, dying in mortal sin. He wouldn\u0027t give him absolution.\"\n \"That\u0027s wrong. Worse, it\u0027s cruel.\"\n \"I threw him out. My mother stood there, tight-lipped, dry-eyed, then she went up to the room where her son\u0027s brains were splattered on the wall and she prayed for his absolution herself.\"\n \"Your mother\u0027s strong. She must have tremendous faith.\"\n \"All she\u0027d ever done was cook.\" He drew Tess closer, needing the soft, feminine scent. \"I don\u0027t know if I could have walked up those stairs a second time, but she did. When I watched her do that, I realized that no matter how much she hurt, no matter how much she\u0027d grieve, she believed and would always believe that what happened to Josh was God\u0027s will.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t.\"\n \"No. It had to be someone\u0027s fault. Josh had never hurt anyone in his life, not until \u0027Nam. Then what he\u0027d done there was supposed to be right because he was fighting for his country. But it wasn\u0027t right, and he couldn\u0027t live with it anymore. The psychiatrist was supposed to show him that no matter what he\u0027d done over there, he was still decent, still worthwhile.\"\n As she had been supposed to show Joey Higgins he was worthwhile. \"Did you ever talk to Josh\u0027s doctor afterward?\"\n \"Once. I think I still had it in my head I should kill him. He sat there behind his desk, with his hands folded.\" Ben looked down at his own, watching them curl into fists. \"He didn\u0027t feel anything. He said he was sorry, explained how extreme Delayed Stress Syndrome could be. Then he told me, while he kept his hands folded on the desk and his voice just two shades away from being involved, that Josh hadn\u0027t been able to cope with what had happened in \u0027Nam, that coming home and trying to live up to what he\u0027d been before had created more and more pressure, until finally the lid had blown off.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Ben. Probably a great deal of what he told you was true, but he could have done it in a different way.\"\n \"It could have meant a damn to him.\"\n \"Ben, I\u0027m not defending him, but a lot of doctors, medical or psychiatric, hold themselves back, don\u0027t let themselves in too close, because when you lose someone, when you aren\u0027t able to save them, it hurts too much.\"\n \"The way losing Joey hurt you.\"\n \"That kind of grief and guilt rips at you, and if it rips at you too often, there\u0027s nothing left, not for you or for the next patient.\"\n Maybe he understood that, or was beginning to. But he couldn\u0027t see Josh\u0027s regular Army shrink closing himself in the bathroom and sobbing. \"Why do you do it?\"\n \"I guess I have to look for answers, the same way you do.\" Turning, she touched his face. \"It does hurt when it\u0027s too little, or too late.\" She remembered how he\u0027d looked when he\u0027d told her about three strangers who\u0027d been murdered for a handful of coins. \"We\u0027re not as different as I once thought.\"\n He turned his lips into her palm, comforted by it. \"Maybe not. When I saw you tonight, I felt the same way I did when I saw you looking at Anne Reasoner in that alley. You seemed so detached from the tragedy of it, so completely in control. Just the way that major had been, with his hands folded on the desk, telling me why my brother was dead.\"\n \"Being in control isn\u0027t the same as being detached. You\u0027re a cop, you have to know the difference.\"\n \"I wanted to know you felt something.\" Sliding his hand down to her wrist, he held it firm while he looked into her eyes. \"I guess what I really wanted was for you to need me.\" And that was perhaps one of the most difficult confessions of his life. \"Then, when I walked into the bathroom and saw you crying, I knew you did, and it scared the hell out of me.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t want you to see me like that.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because I didn\u0027t trust you enough.\"\n He dropped his gaze long enough to study his hand over her slender, impossibly delicate wrist. \"I\u0027ve never told anyone but Ed about Josh. Until now, he\u0027s the only one I\u0027ve trusted enough.\" He brought her fingers to his lips, brushing them lightly. \"So what happens now?\"\n \"What do you want to happen?\"\n A laugh, even when quiet and reluctant, can be cleansing. \"Psychiatrist\u0027s cop-out.\" Thoughtfully, he fingered the pearls around her neck. He unhooked them. Her throat was fragrant and silky. \"Tess, when this is over, if I asked you to take off for a few days, a week, and go somewhere with me, would you?\" Yes.\n Amused, and more than a little surprised, he looked at her. \"Just like that?\"\n \"I might ask where when the time comes, so I\u0027d know whether to pack a fur coat or a bikini.\" She took the pearls from him to set them on the bedside table.\n \"They should be in a safe.\"\n \"I\u0027m sleeping with a cop.\" Her voice was light, but she saw him brooding and thought she understood where his thoughts had taken him. \"Ben, it will be over soon.\"\n \"Yeah.\" But when he brought her close, when he began to fill himself with her, he was afraid.\n It was November twenty-eighth. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sacred-sins/page-17.html","bookId":2413,"book":{"id":2413,"title":"Sacred Sins","description":"Storyline: \n Sacred Sins (D.C.
