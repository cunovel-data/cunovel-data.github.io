{"id":75418,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The boy sat across from Tess, quiet and sullen. He didn\u0027t fidget or look out of the window. He rarely did. Instead, he sat in the chair and looked down at his own knees. His hands lay spread on his thighs, the fingers slender, the knuckles a bit enlarged from nervous cracking. The nails were bitten down below the quick. Signs of nerves, yet people often go through life well enough while cracking and snapping and chewing on themselves.\\n\\n It was rare for him to look at the person he was speaking with, or more accurately in his case, the person speaking to him. Every time she managed to get him to make eye contact, she felt both a small victory and a small pang. There was so little she could see in his eyes, for he\u0027d learned at a young age how to shield and conceal. What she did see-when she was given even that rare, quick chance to look-was not resentment, not fear, only a trace of boredom.\\n\\n Life had not played fair with Joseph Higgins, Jr., and he wasn\u0027t taking any chances on being slipped another shot below the belt. At his age, when adults called the plays, he chose isolation and noncommunication as defense against a lack of choice. Tess knew the symptoms. Lack of outward emotion, lack of motivation, lack of interest. A lack.\\n\\n Somehow, some way, she had to find the trigger that would push him back to caring first about himself, then the world around him.\\n\\n He was too old for her to play games with, too young for her to meet on the level of adult to adult. She had tried both, and he\u0027d accepted neither. Joey Higgins had placed himself firmly in an in-between space. Adolescence wasn\u0027t simply awkward for him, it was miserable.\\n\\n He was wearing jeans, good, solid jeans, with the button fly raved about in the slick commercials, and a gray sweatshirt with the Maryland terrapin grinning across his chest. His leather high-top Nike\u0027s were trendy and new. Light brown hair was cut into moderate spikes around a too thin face. Outwardly he looked like an average fourteen-year-old boy. All the trappings were there. Inside he was a maze of confusion, self-hate, and bitterness that Tess knew she hadn\u0027t even begun to touch.\\n\\n It was unfortunate that instead of being a confidante, a wailing wall, or even a blank sheet of paper to him, she was only one more authority figure in his life. If just once he\u0027d broken out and shouted or argued with her, she would have felt the sessions were progressing. Through them all, he remained polite and unresponsive.\\n\\n \"How are you feeling about school, Joey?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t shrug. It was as if even that movement might give away some of the feelings he kept locked so tightly inside. \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"Okay? I\u0027d guess it\u0027s always kind of tough to switch schools.\" She\u0027d fought against that, done everything in her power to persuade his parents not to make such a dramatic move at this point in his therapy. Bad companions, they had said. They were going to get him away from the people influencing him, those who\u0027d drawn him toward alcohol, a brief flirtation with drugs, and an equally quick but more uneasy courtship with the occult. His parents had only succeeded in alienating him, and hacking away a little more at his self-esteem.\\n\\n It hadn\u0027t been companions, bad or otherwise, who had taken Joey on any of those journeys. It was his own spiraling depression and search for an answer, one he might believe was completely and uniquely his own.\\n\\n Because they no longer found joints in his dresser drawers or smelled liquor on his breath, his parents were confident he was beginning to recover. They couldn\u0027t see, or wouldn\u0027t, that he was still spiraling down quickly. He\u0027d simply learned how to internalize it.\\n\\n \"New schools can be an adventure,\" Tess went on when she received no response. \"But it\u0027s tough being the new kid.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s no big deal,\" he murmured, and continued to look at his knees.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad to hear that,\" she said, though she knew it was a lie. \"I had to switch schools when I was about your age and I was scared to death.\"\\n\\n He glanced up then, not believing, but interested. He had dark brown eyes that should have been eloquently expressive. Instead they were guarded and wary. \"Nothing to be scared of, it\u0027s just a school.\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you tell me about it?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just a school.\"\\n\\n \"How about the other kids? Anyone interesting?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re mostly jerks.\"\\n\\n \"Oh? How\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"They sort of stand around together. There\u0027s nobody I want to know.\"\\n\\n No one he did know, Tess corrected. The last thing he\u0027d needed at this point was to feel rejected by the school after losing the classmates he\u0027d been used to. \"It takes time to make friends, friends who count. It\u0027s harder to be alone, Joey, than it is to try to find them.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want to transfer.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" She was with him there. Someone had to be. \"And I know it\u0027s hard to feel as though you can be yanked around whenever the people who make the rules feel like changing them. It\u0027s not all that way, Joey. Your parents chose the school because they wanted the best for you.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t want them to pull me out.\" He glanced up again, but so quickly, she hardly caught the color of his eyes. \"I heard Mom talking.\"\\n\\n \"As your doctor I felt you might be more comfortable in your old school. Your mother loves you, Joey. Transferring you wasn\u0027t a punishment, but her way of trying to make things better for you.\"\\n\\n \"She didn\u0027t want me to be with my friends.\" But it wasn\u0027t said with bitterness, simply flat acceptance. No choice.\\n\\n \"How do you feel about that?\"\\n\\n \"She was afraid if I was around them, I\u0027d start drinking again. I\u0027m not drinking.\" It was said not resentfully, again not bitterly, but wearily.\\n\\n \"I know,\" Tess said, and laid a hand on his arm. \"You can be proud of yourself for pulling out, for making the right choice. I know how hard you have to work every day not to.\"\\n\\n \"Mom\u0027s always blaming things that happen on somebody else.\"\\n\\n \"What things?\"\\n\\n \"Just things.\"\\n\\n \"Like the divorce?\" As usual, a mention of it brought no response at all. Tess backtracked. \"How do you feel about not riding the bus anymore?\"\\n\\n \"Buses stink.\"\\n\\n \"Your mother\u0027s taking you to school now.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Have you talked to your father?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s busy.\" He looked at Tess with a touch of resentment mixed with a plea. \"He\u0027s got a new job with this computer place, but I\u0027m going to be spending the weekend with him probably next month. For Thanksgiving.\"\\n\\n \"How do you feel about that?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s going to be good.\" The little boy was there briefly, shining with hope. \"We\u0027re going to go to the Redskins game. He\u0027s going to get tickets on the fifty-yard line. It\u0027s going to be like it used to be.\"\\n\\n \"Like it used to be, Joey?\"\\n\\n He looked down at his knees again, but his brows had drawn together in anger.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s important to understand that things won\u0027t be like they used to. Different doesn\u0027t have to be bad. Sometimes change, even when it\u0027s hard, can be the best for everyone. I know you love your father. You don\u0027t have to stop because you\u0027re not living with him.\"\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t have a house anymore. Just a room. He said if he didn\u0027t have to pay child support, he could have a house.\"\\n\\n She could have damned Joseph Higgins, Sr., to hell, but kept her voice firm and soft. \"You understand that your father has a problem, Joey. You are not the problem. Alcohol is.\"\\n\\n \"We have a house,\" he muttered.\\n\\n \"If you didn\u0027t, do you think your father would be happier?\"\\n\\n No response. He was staring at his shoes now.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re going to spend some time with your father. I know you\u0027ve missed him.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s been busy.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Too busy to see his son, too busy to return the calls of the psychiatrist who was trying to heal the hurts. \"Sometimes adults can get pretty wrapped up in their lives. You must know how difficult things are for your father now, in a new job, because you\u0027re in a new school.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to spend a weekend with him next month. Mom says not to depend on it, but I\u0027m going to.\"\\n\\n \"Your mother doesn\u0027t want you to be disappointed if something comes up.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s going to come get me.\"\\n\\n \"I hope so, Joey. But if he doesn\u0027t... Joey...\" She touched his arm again and through sheer force of will drew his gaze to hers. \"If he doesn\u0027t, you have to know that it isn\u0027t because of you, but because of his illness.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n He agreed because agreeing was the quickest way to avoid a hassle. Tess knew it, and wished not for the first time that she could convince his parents he needed more intensive therapy.\\n\\n \"Did your mother bring you today?\"\\n\\n He continued to look down, but the anger, at least outwardly, was gone. \"My stepfather.\"\\n\\n \"Are you still getting along with him?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n \"You know, caring for him doesn\u0027t mean you care less for your father.\"\\n\\n \"I said he\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n \"Any pretty girls at your new school?\" She wanted a smile from him, any size, any kind. I guess.\\n\\n \"Guess?\" Maybe it was the smile in Tess\u0027s voice that had him looking up again. \"You look like you have good eyes to me.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe there\u0027s a couple.\" And his lips did curve a little. \"I don\u0027t pay much attention.\"\\n\\n \"Well, there\u0027s time for that. Will you come back and see me next week?\" I guess.\\n\\n \"Will you do me a favor in the meantime? I said you had good eyes. Look at your mother and your stepfather.\" He turned his head, but she took his hand and held it. \"Joey...\" She waited until those dark, unreadable eyes were on hers again. \"Look at them. They\u0027re trying to help. They may make mistakes, but they\u0027re trying because they care about you. A lot of people do. You still have my number, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I guess I do.\"\\n\\n \"You know you can call me if you want to talk before next week.\"\\n\\n She walked to the door of her office with him and watched as his stepfather rose and gave Joey a big, bluff smile. He was a businessman, successful, easygoing, and well mannered. He was the antithesis of Joey\u0027s father. \"All done, huh?\" He glanced at Tess, and there was no smile, only tension in his expression. \"How\u0027d we do today, Dr. Court?\"\\n\\n \"Just fine, Mr. Monroe.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good, that\u0027s good. Why don\u0027t we pick up some Chinese, Joey, surprise your mom.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" He bundled into his school jacket, the school he no longer attended. Leaving it unsnapped, he turned back and looked at a point beyond Tess\u0027s right shoulder. \"Bye, Dr. Court.\"\\n\\n \"Good-bye, Joey, I\u0027ll see you next week.\"\\n\\n They were feeding him, she thought as she shut her orifice door. And he was starving. They were clothing him, but he was still cold. She had the key, but she had yet to be able to turn it so that it opened the lock.\\n\\n With a sigh, she walked back to her desk. \"Dr. Court?\" Tess answered her intercom as she slipped the Joey Higgins file into the briefcase beside her desk.\\n\\n \"Yes, Kate.\"\\n\\n \"You had three calls while you were in session. One from the Post, one from the Sun, and one from WTTG.\"\\n\\n \"Three reporters?\" Tess slipped her earring off to gently rub her lobe.\\n\\n \"All three wanted confirmation of your assignment to the Priest homicides.\"\\n\\n \"Damn.\" She dropped the earring on her blotter. \"Not available for comment, Kate.\" Yes, ma am.\\n\\n Slowly, she fastened the earring again. She\u0027d been promised anonymity. That had been part of her deal with the mayor\u0027s office. No media, no hype, no comment. The mayor had given her his personal guarantee that she would be able to work without pressure from the press. No use blaming the mayor, Tess reminded herself as she rose to pace to the window. It had leaked, and she would have to deal with it.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t care for notoriety. That was her problem. She liked her life simple and private. That, too, was her problem. Common sense had told her the whole business would come out before it was over, but she\u0027d still taken the job. If she\u0027d been advising one of her patients, she would have told him to face the reality and deal with it one step at a time.\\n\\n Outside, rush hour traffic was starting to heat up. A few horns blasted, but the sound was muffled by the window and distance. Joey Higgins was out there, riding for Chinese takeout with the stepfather he refused to allow himself to trust or love. Bars were ready to serve the let\u0027s-have-a-quick-one-before-dinner crowd. Day care centers were emptying, and throngs of working mothers, single parents, and frazzled daddies were packing up preschoolers and threading their Volvos and BMW\u0027s through packs of other Volvos and BMW\u0027s with one thought in mind: to get home, to be safe and warm behind the doors and windows and walls of the familiar. It was unlikely that any one of them gave any real thought to someone else who was out there. Someone with a small, deadly bomb ticking away inside his head.\\n\\n For a moment she wished she could join them in that easy nightly routine, thinking only about a warm supper or the dentist bill. But the Priest file was already in her briefcase.\\n\\n Tess went back and picked up her briefcase. The first step was to go home and make sure all her calls were screened by her answering service.\\n\\n \"Who leaked it?\" ben demanded, and blew out a stream of smoke.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re still working on it.\" Harris stood behind his desk, studying the officers assigned to the task force. Ed slouched in a chair, passing a bag of sunflower seeds from hand to hand. Bigsby, with his large red face and burly hands, tapped his foot. Lowenstein stood beside Ben with her hands in her pockets. Roderick sat straight in his chair with his hands folded in his lap. Ben looked as though he would bare his teeth and snarl at the first wrong word.\\n\\n \"What we have to do now is work with the situation. The press knows Dr. Court is involved. Instead of blocking them, we use them.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve been getting hammered in the press for weeks, Captain,\" Lowenstein put in. \"Things were just starting to ease off\".\"\\n\\n \"I read the papers, Detective.\" He said it mildly. Bigsby shifted, Roderick cleared his throat, and Lowenstein shut her mouth tight.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll set up a press conference for tomorrow morning. The mayor\u0027s office is getting in touch with Dr. Court. Paris, Jackson-as heads of the team, I want you there. You know what information we\u0027ve cleared for the press.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have anything new for them, Captain,\" Ed pointed out.\\n\\n \"Make it sound new. Dr. Court should be enough to satisfy them. Set up the meeting with this Monsignor Logan,\" he added, shifting his gaze back to Ben. \"And keep this one under wraps.\"\\n\\n \"More shrinks.\" Ben ground his cigarette out. \"The first one hasn\u0027t told us anything we didn\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"She told us he\u0027s on a mission,\" Lowenstein said quietly. \"That even though things have been quiet for a while, he isn\u0027t likely to be finished with it.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s told us he\u0027s killing young, blond women,\" Ben snapped back. \"We\u0027d already figured that out.\"\\n\\n \"Give it a break, Ben,\" Ed murmured, knowing the temper would be deflected on to him.\\n\\n \"You give it a break.\" The hands in Ben\u0027s pockets balled into fists. \"That sonofabitch is just waiting to strangle the next woman who\u0027s in the wrong place at the wrong time, and we sit around talking to psychiatrists and priests. I don\u0027t give a damn about his soul or his psyche.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe we should.\" Roderick looked to the captain first, then to Ben. \"Look, I know how you feel, how I guess we all feel. We just want him. But we\u0027ve all read Dr. Court\u0027s profile. We aren\u0027t dealing with somebody who\u0027s just out for blood, for kicks. If we\u0027re going to do our job, I think we\u0027d better understand who he is.\"\\n\\n \"You get a good look at the morgue photos, Lou? We know who they are. Who they were.\"\\n\\n \"All right, Paris. You want to let off any more steam, you go down to the gym.\" Harris waited a moment, drawing the room together with his sense of authority alone. He\u0027d been a good street cop. He was a better desk cop. Knowing it only depressed him occasionally. \"Press conference is being set up for eight A.M., mayor\u0027s office. I want a report on the meeting with Monsignor Logan on my desk tomorrow. Bigsby, you keep working on where those damn scarfs came from. Lowenstein, Roderick, go back and work on the family and friends of the victims. Now get out of here, go get something to eat.\"\\n\\n Ed waited until they\u0027d signed out, covered the corridors, and were crossing the parking lot.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not doing you any good to take out what happened to your brother on Dr. Court.\"\\n\\n \"Josh has nothing to do with this.\" But the pain was still there. He couldn\u0027t say his brother\u0027s name without it hurting his throat.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. And Dr. Court\u0027s just doing a job, like the rest of us.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s fine. I don\u0027t happen to think that her job has any connection with ours.\"\\n\\n \"Criminal psychiatry has become a viable working tool in the-\"\\n\\n \"Ed, for Christ\u0027s sake, you\u0027ve got to stop reading those magazines.\"\\n\\n \"Stop reading, stop learning. Want to go get drunk?\"\\n\\n \"This from a man carrying sunflower seeds.\" There was still tension along the back of his neck. He\u0027d lost one brother, but Ed had come along and nearly filled the void. \"Not tonight. Anyway, it embarrasses me when you have them pour all that fruit juice in with the vodka.\"\\n\\n \"A man\u0027s got to think of his health.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s also got to think of his reputation.\" Ben opened his car door, then stood jingling his keys.\\n\\n It was a cool night, cool enough so that you could just see your breath. If it rained before morning, as the starless skies indicated, it would come down in sleet. In their tidy, high-ceilinged row houses, Georgetown\u0027s affluent would be setting logs in the fireplace, sipping Irish coffees, and enjoying the flames. The street people were in for a long unpleasant night.\\n\\n \"She bothers me,\" Ben said abruptly.\\n\\n \"A woman looks like that, she\u0027s bound to bother a man.\"\\n\\n \"Not that simple.\" Ben slid into his car and wished he could put his finger on it. \"I\u0027ll pick you up tomorrow. Seven-thirty.\"\\n\\n \"Ben.\" Ed leaned over, holding the door open. \"Tell her I said hi.\" Ben shut the door the rest of the way then gunned the engine. Partners got to know each other too well.\\n\\n Tess hung up the phone, and with her elbows on the desk, pressed the heels of her hands against her eyes. Joe Higgins, Sr., needed therapy as much as his son, but he was too involved with destroying his life to see it. The phone call had resolved nothing. But then, conversations with alcoholics on a binge rarely did. He\u0027d just wept at the mention of his son and slurred a promise to phone tomorrow.\\n\\n He wouldn\u0027t, Tess thought. Odds were he wouldn\u0027t even remember the conversation in the morning. Her treatment of Joey hinged on the father, and the father was glued to the bottle-the same bottle that had destroyed his marriage, lost him countless jobs, and left him alone and miserable.\\n\\n If she could get him to an AA meeting, get him to take the first step... Tess let out a long breath as she dropped her hands. Hadn\u0027t Joey\u0027s mother explained how many times she\u0027d tried, how many years she\u0027d devoted to prying Joseph Higgins, Sr., away from the bottle?\\n\\n Tess understood the woman\u0027s bitterness, respected her determination to resume her own life and bury the past. But Joey couldn\u0027t. All through his childhood his mother had protected him, shielded him from his father\u0027s illness. She\u0027d made excuses for the late nights and the lost jobs, believing the truth should be hidden from the boy.\\n\\n As a child Joey had seen too much, heard more, then had taken his mother\u0027s explanations and excuses and built a wall of lies around his father. Lies he was determined to believe. If his father drank, then drinking was okay. Okay enough that at fourteen Joey was already being treated for alcohol addiction. If his father lost his job, it was because his boss was jealous. Meanwhile Joey\u0027s grades in school slid down and down as his respect for authority and himself diminished.\\n\\n When Joey\u0027s mother had no longer been able to tolerate the drinking and the break had come, the lies, broken promises, and years of resentment had poured out. She\u0027d heaped the fathers faults on the son in a desperate attempt to make him see the mistakes and not to blame her. Joey hadn\u0027t, of course, nor had he blamed his father. There was only one person Joey could blame, and that was himself.\\n\\n His family had broken apart, he\u0027d been taken out of the home he\u0027d grown up in, and his mother had gone to work. He\u0027d floundered. When Mrs. Higgins had married again, it was Joey\u0027s stepfather who had pressed for counseling. By the time Tess had begun to see Joey, he\u0027d had thirteen-and-a-half years of guilt, bitterness, and pain to wade through. In two months she\u0027d barely made a dent in the armor he wore-in their private sessions or the family counseling twice a month with his mother and stepfather.\\n\\n The rage swept through her so quickly, she had to sit for several minutes and fight it off. It wasn\u0027t her function to rage, but to listen, to question, and to offer options. Compassion-she was allowed to feel compassion, but not anger. So she sat with the anger backing up in her, fighting against the control she\u0027d been born with then honed to a professional tool. She wanted to kick something, hit something, strike out somehow at this hateful sense of hopelessness.\\n\\n Instead she picked up Joey\u0027s file and began to make further notes on their afternoon session.\\n\\n Sleet had begun to fall. She picked up her glasses, but didn\u0027t look out of the window, didn\u0027t see the man across the street standing on the curb and watching the light in her apartment. If she had looked, had seen, she would have thought nothing of it.\\n\\n Just as when the knock came she thought of nothing but the annoyance of being interrupted. Her phone had rung incessantly, but she\u0027d been able to ignore that and leave it to her answering service. If one of the calls had been a patient, the beeper beside her would have sounded. The calls, Tess had guessed, had all been connected with the article in the evening\u0027s paper, linking her to the homicide investigation.\\n\\n Leaving the file open, Tess walked to the door. \"Who is it?\"\\n\\n \"Paris.\"\\n\\n A lot could be gleaned from the tone of a voice, even in one word. Tess opened the door, knowing she opened it to a confrontation. \"Detective. Isn\u0027t it a little late for an official call?\"\\n\\n \"Just in time for the eleven o\u0027clock news.\" He walked over and switched on her set.\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t moved from the door. \"Haven\u0027t you got a TV at home?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s more fun to watch a circus with company.\"\\n\\n She shut the door, peevish enough to let it slam. \"Look, I\u0027m working. Why don\u0027t you say what you have to say and let me get back to it?\"\\n\\n He glanced over at her desk, at the files open and her big-framed reading glasses tossed on them. \"This won\u0027t take long.\" He didn\u0027t sit, but stood with his hands in his pockets, watching the news team\u0027s intro. It was the pretty, heart-shaped face brunette who read the evening\u0027s top story.\\n\\n \"The mayor\u0027s office confirmed today that Dr. Teresa Court, noted Washington psychiatrist, has been assigned to the investigation team of the Priest homicides. Dr. Court, granddaughter of veteran Senator Jonathan Writemore, could not be reached for comment. The murders of at least three women are suspected to be linked to the killer termed the Priest because of his use of an amice, a scarf used in ceremony by Roman Catholic priests, to strangle his victims. The police continue an investigation begun last August, now with the assistance of Dr. Court.\"\\n\\n \"Not bad,\" Ben murmured. \"Got your name mentioned three times.\" He didn\u0027t even blink when Tess strode over and slammed the button to off.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll repeat, say what you have to say.\"\\n\\n Her voice was cool. He drew out a cigarette, determined to match her. \"We have a press conference at eight tomorrow in the mayor\u0027s office.\"\\n\\n \"I was notified.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re to keep your comments general, stay as far away from the specifics of the case as possible. The press knows about the murder weapon, but we\u0027ve managed to keep the notes and the contents of them from leaking.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a fool, Ben. I can handle an interview.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you can. This one happens to be on departmental business, not personal glory.\"\\n\\n Her mouth opened, but all that came out was a hiss of breath. She knew it was both undignified and useless to lose her temper. She knew that such a ridiculous and bitter statement deserved no answer. She knew that he, standing there in judgment, deserved nothing but the coolest, most controlled dismissal.\\n\\n \"You bigoted, small-brained, insensitive ass.\" Her phone rang again, but they both ignored it. \"Who the hell do you think you are, barging in here and tossing out your little gems of idiocy?\"\\n\\n He glanced around for an ashtray and settled on a small hand-painted dish. There was a vase of fresh, autumnal mums beside it. \"Which gem was that?\"\\n\\n She stood straight as a soldier, while he stood at ease and flicked ashes into the dish. \"Let\u0027s just get something straight. I didn\u0027t leak this business to the press.\"\\n\\n \"Nobody said you did.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t they?\" She stuffed her hands in the pockets of the skirt she\u0027d worked in for fourteen hours. Her back hurt, her stomach was empty, and she wanted what she struggled so hard to give her patients-peace of mind. \"Well, I interpret this little scene differently. As a matter of fact, I was promised my name would never be linked with this investigation.\"\\n\\n \"Got a problem letting people know you\u0027re cooperating with the police?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you\u0027re clever, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"As hell,\" he returned, fascinated by the complete annihilation of her control. She paced as she spoke, and her eyes had deepened to purple. Temper in her was rigid, and icy, unlike the venom-spitting, plate-throwing sort he was more accustomed to. It was all the more interesting.\\n\\n \"Either way I go, you\u0027ve got an answer. Did it ever occur to you, Detective, that I might not care to have my patients, my colleagues, my friends question me about this case? Did it ever occur to you that I didn\u0027t want to take the case in the first place?\"\\n\\n \"Then why did you? The pay\u0027s lousy.\"\\n\\n \"Because I was persuaded to believe I could help. If I didn\u0027t still think so, I\u0027d tell you to take your case and choke on it. Do you think I want to waste my time arguing with some narrow-minded, self-appointed judge about the morality of my profession? I have enough problems in my life without you adding to them.\"\\n\\n \"Problems, Doc?\" He took a slow sweep of the room, the flowers, the crystal, the soft pastels. \"Things look pretty tidy around here to me.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know anything about me, my life, or my work.\" She walked over to her desk, leaning her palms on it, but still didn\u0027t regain control. \"Do you see these files, these papers, these tapes? There\u0027s a fourteen-year-old boy\u0027s life there. A boy who\u0027s already an alcoholic, a boy who needs someone who can open him up enough to see his own worth, his own place.\" She whirled back again, eyes dark and impassioned. \"You know what it is to try to save a life, don\u0027t you, Detective? You know how it hurts, how it frightens? Maybe I don\u0027t use a gun, but that\u0027s just what I\u0027m trying to do. I\u0027ve spent ten years of my life trying to learn how. Maybe, with enough time, enough skill, enough luck, I\u0027ll be able to help him. Damn.\" She stopped, realizing how far she\u0027d allowed herself to be pushed by a few words. \"I don\u0027t have to justify anything to you.\"\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t.\" As he spoke, he crushed out his cigarette in the little china dish. \"I\u0027m sorry. I was out of line.\"\\n\\n Her breath came out with two hitches as she struggled to bring herself back. \"What is it about what I do that makes you so bitter?\"\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t ready to tell her, to bring that old, fleshed-over scar out in the open for inspection and analysis. Instead he pressed his fingers to his own tired eyes. \"It\u0027s not you. It\u0027s the whole business. Makes me feel like I\u0027m walking a very thin wire over a very long drop.\"\\n\\n \"I guess I can accept that.\" Though it wasn\u0027t the whole answer, or the one she\u0027d wanted. \"It\u0027s hard to stay objective right now.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s take a step back for a minute. I don\u0027t think much of what you do, and I guess you don\u0027t think much of what I do.\"\\n\\n She waited a minute, then nodded. \"Agreed.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re stuck with it.\" He walked over to her desk and picked up her half cup of coffee. \"Got any of this hot?\"\\n\\n \"No. I could make some.\"\\n\\n \"Never mind.\" He brought his hand up to knead at the tension just above his eyebrows. \"Look, I am sorry. It seems like we\u0027ve been running on this treadmill, and the only progress we\u0027ve made is a leak to the press.\"\\n\\n \"I know. You might not be able to understand, but I\u0027m as involved as you are now, and I feel as responsible.\" She paused again, but this time she felt an affinity, an empathy. \"That\u0027s the hard part, isn\u0027t it? Feeling responsible.\"\\n\\n She was too damn good at her job, Ben thought as he leaned back against her desk. \"I\u0027ve got this feeling I can\u0027t shake that he\u0027s about through waiting to hit again. We\u0027re no closer to finding him, Doc. We can bullshit the press some tomorrow, but what we have to swallow is that we\u0027re no closer. You telling me why he\u0027s killing isn\u0027t going to help the next woman he homes in on.\"\\n\\n \"I can only tell you what he looks like inside, Ben.\"\\n\\n \"And I have to tell you I don\u0027t give a damn.\" He turned away from her desk to face her. She was calm again. He could see it just by looking at her eyes. \"When we get him, and we will, they\u0027re going to take this psychiatric profile of yours. They\u0027re going to get other ones done, then they\u0027re going to put you or some other psychiatrist on the stand, and he\u0027s going to get off.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be confined to a mental hospital. That\u0027s not a picnic, Ben.\"\\n\\n \"Until a team of doctors diagnose him cured.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not as simple as that. You know the law better.\" She dragged a hand through her hair. He was right, and so was she. That only made things more difficult. \"You don\u0027t lock someone up because he has cancer, because he can\u0027t control the disintegration of his own body. How can you punish someone without taking into consideration the disintegration of his mind? Ben, schizophrenia alone disables more people for a longer time than cancer. Hundreds of thousands of people are confined to hospitals. We can\u0027t turn our backs on them or burn them as witches because of a chemical imbalance in the brain.\"\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t interested in statistics, in reasons, only in results. \"You said it once, Doc-insanity\u0027s a legal term. Crazy or not, he\u0027s got his civil rights and he\u0027ll be entitled to a lawyer, and his lawyer will use that legal term. I\u0027d like to see you sit down with those three families after it\u0027s done and talk about chemical imbalances. See if you can convince them they\u0027ve gotten justice.\"\\n\\n She had counseled victims\u0027 families before, knew too well the sense of betrayal and bitter helplessness. It was a helplessness that without control could spill over to the healer. \"You\u0027re the one with the sword, Ben, not me. I only have words.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" He\u0027d had them, too, and he\u0027d used them in a way he wasn\u0027t proud of. He had to get out, get home. He wished he had a brandy and a woman waiting for him. \"I\u0027m setting up an appointment with Monsignor Logan tomorrow. You\u0027ll want to be there.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" She crossed her arms and wondered why a bout of temper always left her so depressed. \"I have appointments all day, but I can cancel my four o\u0027clock.\"\\n\\n \"Not too crazy?\"\\n\\n Because he\u0027d made the effort, so did she, and smiled. \"We\u0027ll let that pass.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see if I can schedule for four-thirty. Somebody will call you and set it up.\"\\n\\n \"Fine.\" There seemed to be nothing left to say, and perhaps more to say than either of them could deal with. \"Are you sure you don\u0027t want that coffee?\"\\n\\n He did, and more than that, wanted to sit with her and talk about anything other than what was bringing them together. \"No, I\u0027ve got to go. The streets are a mess already.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\" She glanced toward the window and noticed the sleet.\\n\\n \"Working too hard, Doc, when you don\u0027t see what\u0027s out your own window.\" He walked to the door. \"You haven\u0027t gotten that dead bolt.\"\\n\\n \"No, I haven\u0027t.\"\\n\\n He turned with his hand on the knob. He wanted to stay with her more than he wanted that brandy and imaginary woman. \"Bogart was okay the other night?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Bogart was fine.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe we should do it again sometime.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\"\\n\\n \"See you, Doc. Put on the chain.\"\\n\\n He pulled the door closed, but waited until he heard the rattle of the chain lock being fastened. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sacred-sins/page-4.html","bookId":2413,"book":{"id":2413,"title":"Sacred Sins","description":"Storyline: Sacred Sins (D.C.
