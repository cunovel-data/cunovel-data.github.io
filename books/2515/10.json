{"id":108335,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"This castle and its enclosure are built at the top of a cliff. Coming within a mile, I am able to see through the mist enough to know that the rear of the castle is unapproachable. The drop down the back is virtually straight, a thousand feet easily. Unable to see beyond the drop, I know that the ocean must lie not far beyond that--two miles at most. With such a com?manding view of the sea and coast, Landulf would be able to spot enemies approaching at any point along southern Sicily. His home is strategically placed--as Dante said--as a doorway to the Christian world.\n Outside the castle proper but still within the high stone wall are many small houses, some for living, others military structures where horses and arms are stored. Soldiers with swords wander around small fires, cooking meat, talking among themselves. Over them hangs the bulk of the castle--much larger than I had imagined it. These fires, I see, could not be respon?sible for the strange mist. Yet I no longer smell cooking human flesh and have to wonder if I imagined it.\n I glance behind me. The shadows have grown long, the day is almost over. Dante is nowhere in sight. Yet I hear horses approaching from behind me, where I left Dante. They have a cart of some kind--its wheels creak on the rutted path. Above, a thick branch hangs over me and in a single leap I am cloaked within the leaves of the tree. The castle will have to wait for a moment. I want to see what these men are up to.\n Minutes later I receive partial verification of Dante\u0027s wild tales.\n On the cart is a cage, with metal bars. Three desperate females are locked inside. They are naked, but the four soldiers who have captured them are in full battle gear. Two drive the horses, while the other two are on horseback, one at the front, the other at the rear. The men are young but appear strong and battle tested. The females are each about eighteen. There is, of course, no way I can allow them to be taken into Landulf\u0027s castle, even if my intervening might upset my plans.\n Vaguely, I remember I have rescued them before.\n My plan of attack is simple.\n As the first horse passes beneath me, a hundred feet in front of the cage, I drop down and land on the animal right behind the soldier. He is surprised to have company. I don\u0027t give him a chance to experi?ence the wonder. Reaching up, I grab the back of his head and twist his skull. There is an explosion of bone and cartilage in his neck. He sags to the side, dead, and I shove him from the horse. Behind me, the two horses pulling the cage rear up. My horse I bring to a halt, and turn to face the others.\n Already my long knife is out. Whipping my arm through a blinding arc, I let go of the hilt and plant the blade in the forehead of one of the drivers. The other driver draws his sword. I am forced to run toward him empty-handed. But I receive unexpected help from one of the females. As the soldier raises his sword to strike me, a girl with long hair gives him a swift kick in the back. He loses his balance and topples toward me. Before he hits the ground I relieve him of his sword and cut off his head.\n There is still the fourth soldier, the one bringing up the rear. He has drawn a bow and arrow and is taking aim at me. He is an excellent shot. In the blink of an eye I see an arrow fly toward my head. Ducking, I realize that even though it will miss me, it will strike one of the girls. I am reluctant to show too many of my powers, but I have no choice. As the arrow flies by, I reach up and grab it and then break it over my knee.\n The fourth soldier is worried.\n \"I am going to release the women,\" I say to him, staring. \"They will ride back the way they have come.\"\n The soldier just nods.\n There are keys to the cage tied to the belt of the soldier who has my knife in his forehead. I relieve him of these and open the cage, marveling at the intricacy of the lock. The craftsmanship is far beyond anything I have seen before. But the keys work fine and a moment later the women are free. I give the reins to the one who assisted me, and throw the cloak from a dead soldier over her.\n \"Ride fast from here,\" I say catching her eye. \"Do not speak to anyone about me.\"\n She nods. I step from the cart as she turns it around. In seconds the women in the cart are out of sight. Slowly I walk toward the remaining soldier, who has moved aside to let the women pass. I admire his courage, that he has not tried to bolt. But he is still a kidnapper, and I am thirsty. The soldier draws his sword as I approach but I shake my head.\n \"You are going to die,\" I say. \"It is better not to resist.\"\n He swings at my head, misses. Stepping forward, I grab the hand that holds his sword and look up into his frightened eyes. \"Who sent you to capture those women?\" I ask. \"Was it Landulf?\"\n He shakes his head. \"No.\"\n \"Who then?\"\n He refuses to answer me, even though I press him with my eyes. He continues to shake his head, and I am puzzled. I finally pull him from his horse and throw his sword aside. Drawing his face near, I let him feel the warmth of my breath.\n \"What is he like?\" I ask.\n The man is resolute. \"He is my lord and my master.\"\n \"Is he evil?\"\n He sneers. \"You are evil!\"\n I have to laugh. \"I suppose I am--to you.\"\n He dies, in my arms, from blood loss. Afterward, I feel refreshed, ready for more action. The bodies I hide in the bushes beside the path. The blood, even, I cover over with mud. I wash and dress like a young boy again, my hair under my cap. Then I walk toward the castle and boldly knock at the iron gate that guards the entrance in the wall. A host of soldiers answer and I am stern with them.\n \"I am here to see Landulf of Capua,\" I say in a powerful voice. \"Bring me to him.\"\n They lead me through the courtyard filled with soldiers and smoke to the castle door. A servant comes, and then another. They all seem fairly normal, although I obviously make them nervous. Finally the woman of the house arrives, Landulf s wife, Lady Cia. A striking woman, she wears a high-necked, tight-sleeved, long tunic belted at the waist. Many jewels adorn her hair and elegant fingers. Her hair is black and worn up and her eyes are dark. She is not Mediterranean but English. Her smile is welcoming, yet it doesn\u0027t reach her eyes. She is exceedingly thin, and holds herself under rigid control. I cannot say I warm to her, but she is anything but threatening. Certainly she does not seem afraid of me. I have left my long knife with the bodies of the soldiers.\n Lady Cia invites me in without many questions. I don\u0027t ask why a man who used to be an archbishop now has a wife. Since the pope doesn\u0027t want him, I think, he may have decided to enjoy good company.\n \"It is seldom we get visitors from Greece,\" she says, when I explain where I have just come from. \"But that is not your home, is it, Sita?\"\n Removing my cap, I shake out my blond hair. \"No. Like you, I am from England.\"\n She is pleased. \"You are perceptive. But surely you are not traveling through the country by yourself?\"\n I act sad. \"No. I was with my uncle. But there was an accident on the road, and he was killed.\"\n She touches her heart \"I am so sorry. What was the accident?\"\n \"His horse threw him. His neck broke.\"\n She shakes her head and leads me deeper into the castle. \"You poor dear. You must be devastated. Let us give you food, shelter.\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n The castle is magnificent, and although my eyes strain to detect anything odd, the only unusual thing I see is an excess of wealth, even for a Sicilian aerie commanded by a duke. Landulf has sculptures from all along the Mediterranean. The marble on his floor is inlaid with gold, and the plaster ceilings are warmed by wooden beams. Everything is tasteful, not an offense to the eye. I compliment Cia on her home.\n \"My husband prides himself on his collections.\" She points to a marble statue from ancient Greece. \"Since you were just in that part of the world, I am sure you would appreciate our hero.\"\n I approach the statue, touch it, think of Dante, and pray he is all right. Perseus holds the head of the Medusa in one upraised hand, a sword in the other. His head is slightly bowed; his great exploit has not made him proud. But the face of the Gorgon is a horror, even in death she finds no peace. A feeling of disquiet sweeps over me, but I push it away. I have seen this statue before, of course I have. Lady Cia stands by my side.\n \"Can I have a servant show you to your room?\" she asks. \"You can rest and wash. Then perhaps you can join us for supper.\"\n \"You and Lord Landulf?\"\n She does not flinch at the name. \"Yes. We would both enjoy the company.\" She snaps a finger and a chubby maid appears. \"Marie will show you to your room.\"\n I grasp her hands. They are cold, although the castle is warm, with fires burning in most corners. She trembles at my touch but I steady her with my strength. Staring deep into her eyes, I notice nothing supernatural.\n \"You are most kind,\" I say.\n Marie leads me up three flights of stairs before we come to my quarters. Along the way we pass a window covered with iron bars, and I see that night has firmly arrived. Marie is dressed in a long black tunic over a white chemise. With a rosary around her neck, she could have been a nun. A few of Landulf s walls are covered with frescoes, paintings done directly on fresh plaster. Most of these have a spiritual theme. He seems to have an obsession with the Old Testament. The God that looks over his household is often angry.\n Marie opens a door onto a small room. There is linen on the straw mattress and a bowl of water. Marie lights a row of candles and asks if I need anything else.\n \"No thank you,\" I say.\n She leaves and I am alone. Washing my hands in the water provided, I am at a loss to explain why I keep looking around for a faucet with running water. Then I remember there are such niceties, in other places. The water is cold but seems fresh. I drink some and it rinses away the blood in my mouth. I do not under?stand how the soldier was able to resist my questions. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/creatures-of-forever-the-last-vampire-6/page-10.html","bookId":2515,"book":{"id":2515,"title":"Creatures of Forever (The Last Vampire #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Creatures of Forever (The Last Vampire #6) \n Alisa has fought every battle, against evil, against hate, and even against death itself.
