{"id":108338,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"When I come to, I feel as if I am being crucified. There is pain in my arms and chest, and I can hardly breathe. Opening my eyes, I find myself chained in a cell, deep in a black dungeon. My arms are strung above me, spread out like the wings of a bird, pinned to a dripping stone wall with locks similar to the ones I saw on the cage. This metal is a special alloy that I am unable to break, at least in my present condition. I struggle with the binds and only end up exhausting myself further.\n Naturally, I can still see in the dark. From head to foot, I am covered with blood, but I see that it is not my blood, but that of the girl they were sacrificing.\n The knife has been removed from my spine and that wound has healed. But there is no relief for me.\n Crucifixion brings death by slow suffocation, and the position of my arms and legs mimics that of the Roman style of execution. My feet are also bound to the wall, but they are slightly above the floor so that all the pressure of the metal anklets is on my calf bones. Remnants of Landulf s poisons continue to percolate in my system. I have to wonder if he siphoned off large amounts of my blood while I was unconscious.\n Yet I do not think so.\n How long I have been hanging there, I do not know. But steadily my pain grows so great that I begin to cry quietly to myself. Yes, even I, ancient Sita, who has faced the trials of four thousand years of life and survived, feel as if I have at last been defeated. Each breath is an exercise in cruel labor; the air burns my chest as it is forced in, and each time I exhale, I wonder if I will have the strength to squeeze in another lungful. My cries turn to feeble screams, then moans that reverberate deep in my soul, like the solemn laminations of the dammed already sealed in hell. I feel I have been forced beneath the earth, into a place of unceasing punishment. Landulf s face swims in my mind and I wonder if I see a vision of Satan.\n Yet in my suffering, on the verge of final uncon?sciousness, something remarkable happens. My mind begins to clear, and I remember Alanda and Suzama, Seymour and the child. I see the stars and recall how I floated high above the Earth, and swore to do every?thing I could to protect my mother world. I am five thousand years old, not four thousand. I am from the future and I have returned in time to defeat Landulf. And I will defeat him, I tell myself. He will come for me, I remember he did before. I just have to hang on a little while longer.\n I remember other things as well.\n The Spear of Longinus.\n I remember it from twentieth century Europe.\n In Austria, in the year 1927, in the capital city of Vienna, I saw Richard Wagner\u0027s opera Parsival, which portrayed the adventures of King Arthur\u0027s knights in search of the Holy Grail, in a mythological setting. Historians claimed at that time that there was no historical basis for the events in the opera. Still, Richard Wagner\u0027s masterpiece was very moving, the powerful music, the tragic plot of how the knights struggled against the evil Klingsor, who obstructed them at every step from behind the scenes. Most of all, I was intrigued by Wagner\u0027s use of the Spear of Longinus--which I had seen in my past--as a magic wand in the hands of the evil Klingsor.\n It made me realize, then, that Klingsor might have been Landulf.\n There could be historical accuracy in the opera, after all.\n After leaving the theater, I researched Wagner\u0027s source material and read Wolfram von Eschenbach\u0027s Parsival, upon which the opera was based. I was intrigued to see that the spear played an even more central role in the actual tale, and was stunned to team that Eschenbach had lived eleven generations after the time of Arthur and Parsival, and yet had managed to write a thrilling story even though he was supposedly an illiterate imbecile. From what could be gleaned from the old texts, it seemed that Eschenbach had simply cognized--out of the thin air--the mystical tale.\n Even then, in the twentieth century in Austria, that fact had made me wonder if perhaps Eschenbach\u0027s story was symbolic of deeper truths. Because by the twentieth century, history had all but forgotten Landulf. Yet even Eschenbach, a wandering Homer of little reputation, a minnesinger, had named him the most evil man who had ever lived. Who knew better than I why Eschenbach should condemn the duke so? Chilled by my own memories, I became convinced that Klingsor was indeed Landulf.\n In the story, Klingsor had been an archbishop who lived at Kalot Enbolot, in southwest Sicily, where he summoned demons and sent them forth to torment the world. But most important, Eschenbach had de?scribed Klingsor\u0027s most important identifying mark and the basis of his evil.\n Yet, in Landulf s dark prison, I cannot remember that mark.\n From far away, as I become more delirious, I hear a sound. Knights and lords approaching from above, slowly winding down to my black cell. My torment is unbearable--for it to end, it seems, is all I can hope for. Yet I force in a shuddering breath and steel myself to fulfill my promise to those who sent me back in time. I recall Krishna\u0027s promise to me, that his grace shall always be with me. But I do not ask God to save me, only to give me the strength to save myself.\n The door opens and in strides Landulf.\n Alone. His men wait outside.\n He brings a clean damp towel and wipes at the blood that has dried on my face. Then he touches my cheek, and before I can react, leans forward and plants a kiss on my cracked lips. I try to spit in his face, but there is not enough moisture in my mouth.\n Landulf stares at me with such compassion that I have to wonder if I have slipped into a dream where demons are angels and the future is already burned to ash by our ancestors\u0027 sins. For moment I am in more than one time, but then Landulf slaps me hard on the cheek, even as he pretends to bemoan my torment, and then I am alone with him, only him.\n \"Sita,\" he says with sympathy. \"Why do you do this to yourself?\"\n I strain to moisten my swollen throat. \"I could swear, my lord, that I did not climb into these chains while I was unconscious.\"\n He enjoys my gusto. \"But these chains are of your own making. I have offered you another way. Why don\u0027t you take it? What is the sacrifice for one such as you? We are already old partners in this war.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know that this was a war?\" I say honestly.\n He is serious. \"But it is--a battle far older than even your nonperishable body. It goes back to the birth of the stars, to the dropping of the veil, and of the opening of the two paths back to the source. You see me as a monster but I tell you I am God\u0027s greatest devotee.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you exaggerating just a little?\"\n He slaps me again. \"No! It is the truth you refuse to see. Will is stronger than love. Power lasts longer than virtue, my path is left-handed, true, but it is the swiftest and the surest.\" He pauses and comes closer. \"Did not your friends tell you that all roads lead to the same destination?\"\n His question stuns me, the implications of his insight \"What friends are those?\" I ask innocently.\n He nods to himself as he studies my eyes. \"I have seen you before on the path.\"\n I force a smile and know it must more closely resemble a grimace. \"Then you must know I will never join you. Because although I may be a sinner, I am also a servant. I love virtue, I love human love, even if I am not human. These are the things that bring me the most joy. Your path may be swift and sure but it is barren. The desert surrounds your every step and you walk forever a thirsty man. You may leave me to rot in this cell, but I am not forsaken. When I leave this body I know I will drink deep of Christ\u0027s and Krishna\u0027s fathomless love, and I will be happy while you crawl on your hands and knees to invoke your miserable demons. Whom you send out to perform deeds you are too frightened to perform in person. You sicken me, Landulf. Had I a free hand, I would tear your tongue from your face so that you could no longer spew lies in my direction.\"\n He is unmoved by my speech.\n \"You will beg for my mercy, Sita. You will kill at my bidding.\"\n I snort. \"You will not live long enough, my lord, to see me do either.\"\n He holds my eye. \"We shall see.\" He raises a hand and snaps a finger and two armor-clad soldiers with torches, a prisoner between them, waddle into the cell.\n They have brought Dante.\n \"My lady!\" he cries when he sees me and tries to run to my side. But he trips and falls facedown on the damp floor, and is only able to rise when Landulf pulls him up by his hair. The black lord shoves my friend in my direction and Dante cowers and prays at my feet, weeping to see me in such a desperate condition. I would weep for my friend if there were any tears left in my body. But all I can do is sigh and shake my head.\n \"Dante,\" I say. \"I told you to go back to Messina. Why are you here?\"\n He clasps my foot. \"I could not leave you, my lady. I will never leave you.\"\n Landulf is grim. \"We caught him outside the castle walls, groveling like an animal.\" He grabs him by the neck and picks him all the way up off the floor with one hand. The demonstration of strength disturbs me. Perhaps he did take my blood, and put it into his veins, while I was unconscious. Yet Landulf does not show the signs of being a true vampire. He dangles Dante in front of me. \"Will you not beg, Sita?\" Landulf asks me.\n I am fearful. \"For what?\"\n \"You know, my proud ruby.\"\n I sneer. \"Why beg for that which does not exist?\"\n In response Landulf throws Dante down in a heap and takes a torch from one of his men. Knocking out the flame on the damp wall, he steps toward Dante with the embers of the torch top still glowing. Seeing what Landulf has in mind, Dante tries to scamper to me but is kicked aside by Landulf. The evil lord kneels by my friend and points out to me Dante\u0027s sores.\n \"These wounds are infected,\" Landulf says. \"They must be cauterized and sealed. Don\u0027t you agree, Sita?\"\n I stare in horror. \"He served you loyally for many years.\"\n Landulf eyes Dante, who trembles in anticipation.\n \"But he betrayed me in the end,\" he says. \"And it is only the end that matters, not the manner of the path.\"\n \"Landulf!\" I cry.\n But he ignores me, and then Dante is crying, screaming for me to save him as if I were his mother. But even though I have returned in time with the wisdom of the ages, I can do nothing--cannot keep Landulf from pressing the embers into Dante\u0027s oozing sores. Landulf first does my friend\u0027s deformed hand, and then he moves toward Dante\u0027s leg, where the damage is even more extensive. Dante howls so loud and hard it seems as if his skull will explode. Cer?tainly the sound threatens to rupture my own heart. As Landulf moves forward with the torch again, I hear myself cry out.\n \"Please?\" I yell. \"Please stop!\"\n Landulf pauses and smiles up at me. \"You beg me?\"\n I nod weakly. \"I beg you, my lord.\"\n Landulf stands. \"Good. You have passed the first step of initiation. The second step will come later, and then the final and third step.\" He gestures to Dante, on the floor, who appears to have gone into shock. He speaks to his knights. \"Chain this bag of garbage up beside her. Let them keep each other company, and let them talk together about the redeeming and saving power of love and mercy.\" Landulf winks at me as he leaves the dungeon. \"I will see you soon, Sita.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/creatures-of-forever-the-last-vampire-6/page-13.html","bookId":2515,"book":{"id":2515,"title":"Creatures of Forever (The Last Vampire #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Creatures of Forever (The Last Vampire #6) \n Alisa has fought every battle, against evil, against hate, and even against death itself.
