{"id":24519,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII THE TORCH OF REBELLION","content":"With a bound I stood within the grim vault and searched its confines with anxious eyes. True enough, the place was empty. Not a scrap of paper, a book, or a bank-note had been left there. The shelves that lined the walls were as bare as Mother Hubbard’s cupboard. The records of the Revolution were gone. The body of Miguel de Pintra was gone. Thank God, the great and glorious Cause was as yet safe! Valcour was on his hands and knees, prying into the corners for some scrap that might have been overlooked. Paola stood beside me with the old aggravating simper upon his face, twirling one end of his moustache. Suddenly Valcour stood up and faced him. “Traitor!” he cried, with a passionate 193gesture, “it is you who have done this! It is you who have led us here only to humiliate us and laugh at us!” “Your Majesty,” said Paola, without moving his head, “will you kindly protect me from the insults of your servants?” “Have peace, Valcour!” growled the Emperor. “Senhor Francisco has proved his loyalty, and doubtless shares our chagrin. Come, gentlemen, let us leave this dismal place.” I followed slowly in the train of the party as it wound its way through the narrow passage and up the iron stairs into the library. My hand-cuffs had been removed when I was brought to open the vault, and an idea came to me to lag behind and try to effect my escape from the house. But Valcour was waiting for me at the trap door, and called Captain de Souza to guard me. I was taken to the large room on the ground floor, from whence they had brought me, thrust through the doorway, and the key turned upon me. Piexoto had been taken elsewhere, and I found myself alone. 194My thoughts were naturally confused by the amazing discovery we had just made, and I was so engaged in wondering what had become of Dom Miguel and the records that I scarcely looked up when the door opened to admit Francisco Paola. He had in his hand a small parcel that looked like a box, which he placed upon a table near the open window. Next he drew a note-book from his pocket, scribbled some lines upon three several leaves, and then, tearing them out, he reached within the box, taking care to lift but a portion of the cover, and busied himself some moments in a way that made me wonder what he could be doing. I had no suspicion of the truth until he carried the box to the window and quickly removed the cover. Then, although his back was toward me, I heard a rapid flutter of wings, followed by a strange silence, and I knew that Paola was following with his eyes the flight of the birds he had liberated. “So, my dear Minister, I have at last discovered your secret!” said a sharp voice, and as Paola whirled about I noted that 195Valcour had entered the room and was standing with folded arms and eyes that sparkled triumphantly. “Orders to my men,” remarked the Minister, quietly, and brushed a small feather from his arm. “True enough!” retorted Valcour, with a bitter smile. “Orders to General Fonseca, whom you strangely overlooked in making your decoy arrests. Orders to Sanchez Bastro, who is to distribute arms to the rebels! And where did the third pigeon go, my loyal and conscientious Minister of Police? To Mazanovitch, or to that Miguel de Pintra whom you falsely led us to believe had perished in yonder vault?” He came close to the Minister. “Traitor! In setting free these birds you have fired the torch of rebellion; that terrible flame which is liable to sweep the land, and consume royalist and republican alike!” Paola, the sneering smile for once gone from his face, gazed at his accuser with evident admiration. “You are wonderfully clever, my dear 196Valcour,” said he, slowly. “You have wit; you have a clear judgment; your equal is not in all Brazil. What a pity, my friend, that you are not one of us!” Somehow, the words seemed to ring true. Valcour flushed to the roots of his hair. “I hate you,” he cried, stamping his foot with passion. “You have thwarted me always. You have laughed at me—sneered at me—defied me! But at last I have you in the toils. Francisco Paola, I arrest you in the name of the Emperor.” “On what charge?” “The charge of treason!” Paola laughed softly, and in a tone denoting genuine amusement. “Come, my brave detective,” said he; “we will go to the Emperor together, and accuse each other to our hearts’ content!” He attempted to take Valcour’s arm, in his inimitable jaunty fashion; but the spy shook him off and followed Paola from the room, trembling with suppressed rage. For my part, I knew not what to make of the scene, except that these men were bitter enemies, and each endeavoring to destroy 197the other. But could Valcour’s accusation be true? Had the torch of revolution really been fired? God forbid that I should ever meet with such another man as Francisco Paola again! Deep or shallow, coxcomb or clever conspirator, true man or traitor—it was as impossible to read him or to judge his real character as to solve the mighty, unfathomable secrets of Nature. One moment I called him traitor; the next I was sure he was faithful to the Cause. But who could judge the man aright? Not I, indeed! Thus reflecting, I approached the window and looked out. Eight feet below me one of the Uruguayan guards paced back and forth upon the green lawn, his short carbine underneath his arm, and a poniard swinging at his side. The fellow looked up and saw me. “Close that window!” he commanded, with a scowl. I obeyed, sliding the sash to its place. But still I gazed through the glass at the labyrinth of walks and hedges defining the 198extensive gardens at this side of the house. I knew every inch of these grounds, having wandered there many hours during my sojourn at the mansion. And the thought came to me that it would not be difficult to escape in that maze of hedge and shrubbery, had I once a fair start of my pursuers. Within my range of vision was a portion of the driveway, and presently I saw the Emperor’s carriage roll away, followed by several others. Piexoto was seated in the last of the carriages, but only a small portion of the Uruguayan guard accompanied the cortège. I tried to see if the Minister of Police was among those who were returning to Rio, but was unable to note his presence in the brief time the carriages were in view. Nor did Valcour seem to be with them. Captain de Souza evidently remained in charge of the guards left at the mansion. Well, I longed to leave the place myself, now that the emptiness of the secret vault had been disclosed; but for some reason my captors desired me to remain a prisoner. The day dragged wearily away. One 199of the Uruguayans brought me food at noontime, and I ate with good appetite. The room grew close, but when I attempted to raise the window the surly guard outside presented his carbine, and I respected his wish to leave the sash lowered. During this time I had ample opportunity to speculate upon the astonishing events of the morning; but my attempt to solve the problem of what had become of Dom Miguel and the records seemed absolutely futile. That the body of the chief had been removed by some friendly hand—the same that had saved the funds and papers—there was no doubt whatever. But when had this removal taken place? At one time a fleeting hope animated me that the vault had been entered in time to save Dom Miguel from suffocation; but a little reflection soon caused me to abandon that notion. Allowing that the slayer of Madam Izabel had been a patriot, and left the train at the first station beyond Cruz, he could not possibly have returned to de Pintra’s mansion on the swiftest horse within eight hours of the time my friend had been 200entombed alive, and long before that Dom Miguel would have succumbed to the confined atmosphere of his prison. Moreover, none of the conspirators who knew of the ring or was competent to recognize it had been on the train at the time of Izabel de Mar’s death. Therefore the patriot who finally secured the key to the vault and saved the records must have obtained the ring long after any hope of saving the life of the imprisoned chief had been abandoned. Somehow, it occurred to me that the man in the shrubbery had not been murdered by the Mexican, but by some one of our band who had promptly cleared the vault and escaped with the contents—even while the Emperor and his party were in possession of the house. The ring might have been dropped during the escape and found by the Mexican—this being the only plausible way to account for its being in his possession. Although these speculations were to some extent a diversion, and served to occupy my thoughts during my tedious confinement, there were many details to contradict their 201probability, and I was not at all positive that I had discovered the right explanation of the mystery. It must have been near evening when the door was again opened. This time a man was thrust into the room and the door quickly locked upon us. I started from my chair with an exclamation of dismay. My fellow-prisoner was the mad Mexican!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1680/49524.html","bookId":1172,"book":{"id":1172,"title":"The Fate of a Crown","description":"简介： Leaning back in my chair, I smoked my morning cigar and watched Uncle Nelson open his mail.
