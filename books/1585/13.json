{"id":111100,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"That\u0027s where I\u0027m going,\" Chapel told her. \"You\u0027re staying right here.\"\n ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+26:36\n \"You can\u0027t be serious,\" Julia said. \"I\u0027ve come all this way, and now-\"\n \"The last time we tried to find Funt, we were both nearly killed by an improvised bomb,\" Chapel pointed out. \"There\u0027s no telling what\u0027s down there, waiting for me.\"\n \"And you think you\u0027re safer on your own?\" Julia asked. Her eyes were bright with anger. \"I\u0027m not some kid you\u0027re being paid to babysit, Chapel.\"\n \"No. You\u0027re a civilian who doesn\u0027t need to know all the facts of this case.\"\n Even as the words came out of his mouth he knew he\u0027d made a bad mistake with her. He could see in her eyes that he\u0027d picked exactly the wrong thing to say.\n Her mouth compressed in a hard line, and she folded her arms across her chest. \"And that\u0027s all that I am. Right?\"\n He racked his brain for some way to explain what he\u0027d meant better, to smooth things over. But there was no time for that. \"I have to go, now. Lives are at stake,\" he said, which even to his own ears just sounded bad. \"Listen, I need you to stay up here and watch for cops. If they come down after me, it\u0027ll spook Funt and he\u0027ll run away.\"\n She shook her head and looked away from him.\n At least she wasn\u0027t arguing the point.\n He ducked through the short doors of the hatch and headed down the stairs.\n Angel\u0027s voice sounded in his ear. \"That\u0027s not the fastest way to a woman\u0027s heart, sugar,\" she said.\n Chapel looked up and saw Julia\u0027s legs framed by the open hatch above him. He whispered his reply so she wouldn\u0027t hear it. \"I\u0027m still a professional, Angel. I have questions for Funt. He has information I need. Information a civilian shouldn\u0027t hear.\"\n \"I\u0027m torn here,\" Angel said. \"The part of me that works for Hollingshead thinks that\u0027s absolutely right, and that you\u0027re acting exactly as you should.\"\n \"And the other part?\" Chapel asked.\n \"The part of me that\u0027s a woman thinks you\u0027re being a jerk.\"\n \"I\u0027ll settle for being half right,\" Chapel told her.\n The stairs before him led down into a dark cavernous space filled with looming shapes. A storage area full of crates. He could see very little while his eyes were adjusting, but eventually he made out a line of pale light ahead in the darkness. It was coming from underneath a door. He reached for the knob and found it wasn\u0027t locked. Beyond lay a corridor painted glaring white, lit by fluorescent bulbs that buzzed angrily as if annoyed at his intrusion.\n \"-having trouble-\" Angel said in his ear. \"-losing your telemetry and-\"\n \"Angel?\" Chapel asked. \"Angel, you\u0027re breaking up.\"\n \"-signal. You\u0027re pretty far beneath the-\"\n \"Angel?\" Chapel called. \"Angel, repeat. Please come in.\"\n A burst of static sounded in his ear, but it cut in and out.\n Apparently there were some places even Angel couldn\u0027t tread. The vast amount of concrete and steel over Chapel\u0027s head must be blocking her satellite signal. Damn. He hated proceeding without her watching over his shoulder.\n ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+26:47\n Chapel stepped into the white hallway. Three doors, also painted white, led off the corridor in a number of directions. One of them was a heavy reinforced steel door with a sliding plate set into its face. Its latch was protected by a massive combination lock. Chapel lifted the lock and found it had rusted shut-it might have been hanging there for twenty years, for all he knew. The sliding panel looked like it was painted shut.\n He could hear music. Faint music that sounded tinny like it was coming from a transistor radio. He banged on the door for a while, but there was no response. He tried the second door, but that was locked, too.\n He headed down the corridor to the final door. The music seemed louder there. He rested his ear against the door and through it he could almost make out what song was playing. The sound had to be coming from behind that door.\n His instinct was to draw his weapon. It was possible the chimera had beaten him here.\n But he\u0027d seen no sign of a struggle. \"Mr. Funt!\" he shouted. \"Turn off your music and listen to me! I\u0027m here to help!\"\n There was, of course, no reply.\n Chapel grunted in frustration and grabbed the knob of the door before him. It turned easily and the door opened on well-oiled hinges.\n Beyond lay a linen closet with a number of shelves. On one shelf sat the radio, playing some light jazz.\n On another shelf sat a squarish box made of green metal, slightly convex, propped up on a pair of scissor-shaped legs. In raised lettering on the front of the box was the legend FRONT TOWARD ENEMY.\n Chapel knew instantly that it was a claymore antipersonnel mine.\n ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+26:51\n Julia considered just leaving. After what Chapel had said to her, she was righteously angry-after everything she\u0027d been through, for him to talk to her like she was an unruly child . . . it was sorely tempting to just walk away, to get a cab to the airport and go . . . somewhere else.\n She was smart enough to know that would be a terrible idea, though. Laughing Boy was still out there somewhere, looking for her. He would eventually find her. And if she didn\u0027t have Chapel around to protect her when that happened, she would die.\n But damn Chapel! She\u0027d thought, after what had happened that morning, that maybe there was something between them beyond just his business. She\u0027d begun to think . . . well, she had no idea what she\u0027d begun to think. But that was over now. Right out of the question. He\u0027d gotten what he wanted. He was the big strong knight in shining armor and she had fallen straight into his arms-arm-like she\u0027d been following some cheesy Hollywood script, and she hated herself for that a little. Now that he\u0027d fucked her he had lost all interest in her as a human being, clearly. Just like every other man she\u0027d ever met before. If he thought she was going to share his bed again tonight, he was sorely mistaken. She was her own woman and she could make her own choices.\n She couldn\u0027t just walk away from him, obviously. She was stuck with him. But while he was off gallivanting around, at least, she considered herself on her own recognizance.\n There were shops around her, places she could go find some fresh clothes. Places to get something to eat. She was hungry.\n And maybe if she left, the homeless guy would leave her alone.\n \"Do you like jazz?\" he asked her, for the third time. He had a hopeful twinkle in his eye. Still.\n \"Not particularly,\" she said.\n Chapel had been down there for what felt like fifteen minutes. What was taking him so long? He just had to grab Funt and come back up. That shouldn\u0027t have taken more than a few minutes. She wondered if maybe he\u0027d stumbled on some booby trap down there and gotten himself blown up.\n It would serve him right, she thought. Leaving her here with this wino so she could watch for the police.\n From what she could tell, Underground Atlanta wasn\u0027t exactly high on the list of places cops went to hang out. It was clogged with homeless people and drug dealers.\n \"You\u0027re not a tourist, I can tell,\" the drunk said, as if he\u0027d just proved he was Sherlock freaking Holmes. \"That guy you\u0027re with, he\u0027s some kind of-what? Urban explorer? Thrill-seeking spelunker?\"\n \"He\u0027s a building inspector,\" Julia said, thinking on her feet. \"I\u0027m his assistant. We had reports that radon gas was leaking from this place, so he went down to check out just how deadly it is. Just standing here is probably giving you cancer.\"\n The drunk\u0027s eyes went wide, but then he laughed. It was not a sound she particularly cared for. Not after the previous day, when she\u0027d had to lock herself in her own drugs closet while a laughing man claiming to be a cop tried to shoot her.\n \"You\u0027re just foolin\u0027 an old fool,\" the drunk said. \"Tell you what. Let\u0027s play a game. The game\u0027s called Truth or Dare. You can pick which one-\"\n \"I\u0027ve played Truth or Dare before,\" Julia said.\n \"I\u0027ll just bet you have,\" he said, with a leer.\n Julia just sighed.\n \"Okay, I pick Dare,\" the drunk said, and he moved around her until she couldn\u0027t help but look in his face.\n \"I dare you to go brush your teeth,\" Julia said. She turned away from him, not even wanting to look at him anymore.\n But then she saw something that made her blood ran cold. A man in a charcoal gray suit. A man with a crew cut and a pair of thick black sunglasses, despite the gloom of the Underground. She knew his face.\n It was Laughing Boy.\n And he was walking right toward her.\n ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+27:56\n Chapel knew all about claymore mines.\n They were designed to shred people. Nestled inside that green box were approximately seven hundred steel balls embedded in C-4 plastic explosive. When the mine went off, it would send all of them screaming forward, right through his body. The force of the explosion would deform them into the shape of bullets. Anyone standing as much as fifty meters away from the explosion would be cut to ribbons by the blast. As close as Chapel was, there would be little left of him afterward but red goo.\n He threw his artificial arm up to protect his face. It would do no good at all, but it was a reflex action. So was screaming. He managed not to do that.\n Instead he shouted, \"Funt, I\u0027m DIA!\"\n He knew something else about claymore mines, too. They weren\u0027t actually mines at all. They weren\u0027t designed to go off when you stepped on them or crossed a tripwire. They were designed to be remotely detonated by someone with a triggering device, someone nearby.\n The claymore didn\u0027t explode. At least not for the moment.\n Instead, Chapel heard a shrieking sound just behind him. He braced himself for instant death coming from some other quarter. When he didn\u0027t die, he slowly turned around and looked at what had made that noise.\n The sliding panel in the reinforced steel door to his side was drawing back, tearing the paint around it as it moved. When it was retracted all the way, he saw a face behind it-the face of a man maybe sixty years old, wearing a pair of thick-lensed glasses. The eyes behind those lenses were hugely magnified. Chapel saw them narrow as they peered toward him.\n \"DIA?\" the man asked. \"They sent somebody from Military Intelligence this time?\"\n This time? Chapel shook his head. No time to unravel that, not with a claymore mine right behind him. \"My name\u0027s Chapel. Captain Jim Chapel. I was sent to protect you from the chimeras,\" Chapel told him. His arm was still up across his face. Slowly he lowered it. \"Please, please, do not detonate this thing. Are you still holding the clacker?\"\n Jeremy Funt-it could be no one else-held up the green metal detonator for the claymore. His thumb was resting on the trigger. \"I am. I\u0027m going to keep hold of it, for now. You have some kind of ID I can look at?\"\n \"It\u0027s in my jacket pocket,\" Chapel told him. \"I\u0027m going to reach for it now.\" The man was a paranoid nut. There was nothing to be gained whatsoever by spooking him. If he thought Chapel was reaching for a gun, he might detonate the claymore on instinct. \"Is that all right?\"\n \"Sure. Just do it slow.\"\n Chapel nodded and carefully removed his laminate from his pocket. He held it up before Funt\u0027s eyes and let the man read it.\n \"I hope you\u0027ll forgive me,\" Funt said, \"if I\u0027m a little careful.\"\n \"I understand,\" Chapel said. \"There\u0027s one of them in Atlanta right now. We have to assume he\u0027s coming for you.\"\n Funt shrugged. \"So what else is new? That\u0027s an old, old story.\"\n Chapel frowned in confusion. \"I\u0027m sorry? You\u0027re used to being hunted down by dangerous lunatics?\"\n \"If by \u0027dangerous lunatics\u0027 you mean \u0027CIA hit men,\u0027 then . . . yes,\" Funt replied.\n ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+27:03\n \"Come on, come on,\" Julia whispered, pressing the redial button on her phone. \"Chapel, pick up already!\"\n But there was no answer. This was the third time she\u0027d tried to call Chapel\u0027s number and he still wasn\u0027t picking up.\n When she saw Laughing Boy coming toward her, she\u0027d panicked. She just ran, not knowing where she was headed, not knowing what she should do. She\u0027d gotten around a corner and found a women\u0027s restroom and ducked inside and started dialing.\n She had no illusions that Laughing Boy wouldn\u0027t follow her inside. She just hadn\u0027t known where else to go.\n \"Shit,\" she said under her breath.\n And then she nearly screamed, because her phone started to buzz in her hand.\n She stared at the screen and saw she was being called by someone whose phone number was listed as (000) 000-0000. What the hell?\n The phone kept buzzing. She swiped the screen to answer. \"Hello?\" she asked, keeping her voice as low as she could.\n \"Dr. Taggart,\" a woman\u0027s voice said, \"you\u0027ve been trying to call Captain Chapel for a while now. He\u0027s outside of cellular coverage and can\u0027t take your call, so I thought I\u0027d make sure you were all right.\"\n \"Who are you?\" Julia demanded. For all she knew this was somebody who worked with Laughing Boy trying to track her down.\n \"You can call me Angel,\" the woman on the other end of the line said. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve seen Captain Chapel talking into his hands-free unit. I believe you said it made him look like a douche bag. I was the person he was talking to.\"\n Julia shut her eyes and tried to breathe. \"Thank God. I\u0027m in real trouble here. I need you to send help or something. There\u0027s this guy-this, I don\u0027t know, he claimed he was a policeman before, but that was in New York, this guy who tried to kill me, and-\"\n \"You\u0027re talking about Laughing Boy,\" Angel said.\n \"Yes,\" Julia told her. \"He just showed up here, in Atlanta. We\u0027re in some kind of underground mall and-\"\n \"I have your location. Dr. Taggart, I need to ask you a personal question. From everything I\u0027ve seen so far, you\u0027re a pretty strong woman. Would you say that\u0027s a correct assumption?\"\n Instantly Julia calmed down. She opened her eyes and changed her grip on the phone. \"I like to think of myself as a competent person.\"\n \"Right now I need you to be one tough bitch,\" Angel told her.\n ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+27:05\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" Chapel said. \"The CIA is trying to kill you? You know that sounds crazy, right?\"\n \"Captain,\" Funt said, \"I have a clacker in my hand ready to detonate the claymore mine behind you. I\u0027m well protected behind this door. You might be smart about this and not insult me.\"\n \"That\u0027s a fair point,\" Chapel said.\n \"The CIA has been trying to kill me for nearly fifteen years. I know too much to be left free and alive. I\u0027ve survived this long by being quick on my feet and not taking chances. You claim to be a DIA agent, but it would be relatively easy for a CIA assassin to fake those credentials. So I\u0027m assuming that you\u0027re just the latest in a long line of hit men.\"\n Chapel shook his head. \"You have to believe me. You have to trust me.\"\n \"I do?\" Funt asked.\n \"Yes! There\u0027s a man coming for you right now, someone who isn\u0027t a CIA agent but who definitely wants to kill you. I don\u0027t know what kind of threats you think you\u0027ve survived all this time, but-\"\n \"In 1998, they sent a team of men in commando gear, carrying M4 rifles, to my home. I happened to be coming back from the grocery store at the time and so I nearly walked in on them ransacking my place. I turned around and drove away and never went back. Since then I\u0027ve been moving every few months, staying light on my feet. In 2001, they caught up with me in Montana. You ever been to Montana, Chapel? It\u0027s big sky country. Lots of open space, not a lot of good places to hide. They only sent one man that time, maybe because they figured I would be expecting a team, maybe because they thought they had me cornered. This guy was pretty slick. Claimed to be FBI, like I used to be. Said he wanted to discuss some old cases with me. I had him inside my house and pointing a gun at my face, ready to shoot. The only reason I survived was because I\u0027d already poisoned his coffee.\"\n \"Jesus,\" Chapel said. This guy was crazy. Dangerously crazy.\n \"He lived. I didn\u0027t want to kill anybody, not back then. I just fed him enough rat poison to give me time to get out of there. To escape. I went to New Orleans. Now there\u0027s a place a man can lose himself. Or at least I thought so-until 2003, when the same man, the one I\u0027d poisoned, came for me again. I couldn\u0027t take any chances that time. I set fire to my own apartment on the way out. Maybe he got out in time, maybe he didn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t go back to check. In 2006, a new guy started coming for me.\"\n I\u0027m going to die here, Chapel thought. I\u0027m going to die because this man is insane and he thinks anyone who comes looking for him is an assassin.\n \"This one figured he\u0027d play it real simple. No false ID, no tricky attempts to convince me he was an old friend. He just walked up to me in the parking lot of a Starbucks and started shooting. I got out of there by the skin of my teeth.\"\n \"So the bomb in your house-\"\n \"Just in case,\" Funt explained.\n The story was nuts, but it explained one thing. There had been dust all over Funt\u0027s house, far more dust than could be easily explained. At least, it couldn\u0027t be explained if Funt had set the bomb only after Angel called him.\n No. This guy had been expecting an assassin for years. He had no idea that this time the assassin was real-but not human.\n \"Weird thing about this latest guy. He couldn\u0027t stop laughing, the whole time he was plugging away at me. He came back in 2009-it must have taken him that long to track down my newest identity. I saw him coming in time. Then in 2010-\"\n \"Wait,\" Chapel said. \"Hold on. Laughing? He was laughing the whole time?\"\n \"It was creepy as hell. I don\u0027t know who you really are, Captain Chapel, but at least you look normal.\"\n \"I know that guy,\" Chapel said. \"The laughing guy. He is CIA, that\u0027s true. And he\u0027s definitely a killer.\"\n \"Mm-hmm. Do you still think I\u0027m crazy, then?\"\n Absolutely, Chapel thought. But maybe not delusional. It was possible that the CIA really was trying to assassinate Funt. The fact they\u0027d failed so many times was a little hard to accept-but then again, how many times had they tried to kill Fidel Castro and never got him? \"You said you knew too much,\" Chapel said. \"That\u0027s why they\u0027re after you. I think I have an idea what it is you know, and why it\u0027s so sensitive.\"\n \"Figures. They would\u0027ve briefed you on me when they sent you down here to kill me.\" Funt raised the clacker so Chapel could see it again.\n \"Wait! It\u0027s what I wanted to talk to you about. It\u0027s why I was sent here, yes, but to protect you!\"\n \"Choose your next words carefully,\" Funt told him.\n \"It\u0027s about the chimeras, isn\u0027t it? That\u0027s what you know about. The chimeras they were holding in some prison camp up in the Catskills. You need to know something, Special Agent Funt. You need to know they escaped. They escaped, and one of them is in Atlanta right now, coming for you.\"\n Funt looked like an electric shock had run through him. Chapel thought he could see the hair standing up on the man\u0027s knuckles.\n \"Malcolm got loose?\" Funt asked. \"Oh crap.\"\n ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+27:15\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Chapel bluffed. \"Malcolm. Malcolm the chimera. He had your name and address and I came here to make sure he didn\u0027t kill you.\"\n Funt stared at Chapel. \"No offense, guy, but you\u0027re not up to this. I don\u0027t know what kind of training you\u0027ve had, but Malcolm-he\u0027ll be all grown up now. He\u0027ll be more than a match for anything you bring to the table.\"\n \"I can handle him,\" Chapel promised.\n \"They must not have told you anything about the chimeras. They\u0027re tougher than you can imagine, faster than anything human. They\u0027re also meaner and more-\"\n \"I killed one in New York, yesterday,\" Chapel said, because he needed Funt to trust him.\n \"If that\u0027s true-and I doubt it,\" Funt said, \"then you got extremely lucky. When I first saw Malcolm, he was ten years old. Even then he left me in the hospital for months. No, if he\u0027s coming here . . . I\u0027m as good as dead. Damn, damn, damn. I\u0027ve got to think. I\u0027ve got to think about this.\"\n \"I can help,\" Chapel pleaded.\n \"I\u0027ll need to lay some more traps. I\u0027ll need to get a gun . . . damn. Damn! Malcolm, after all this time-he won\u0027t stop. The CIA goons, they lose their nerve after a while, but Malcolm . . . he\u0027s got good reason to kill me. And they never even need a reason. Damn!\"\n \"Funt,\" Chapel said, softly, \"you must realize you stand a better chance if you work with me. If you want to live through this, you can\u0027t afford to turn down any help.\"\n Funt stared at him through the sliding hatch in the steel door. He reached up with his free hand and scratched at his eyebrows. He looked like he was about to start screaming in panic. \"Not here,\" he said.\n \"Special Agent Funt-\"\n \"I didn\u0027t live this long by being dumb! I need to think. I need to make some plans. Damn!\"\n \"Just come with me, I\u0027ll take you someplace safe,\" Chapel promised.\n \"No,\" Funt said. \"No. I\u0027ll give you the benefit of the doubt. I\u0027ll assume you are who you say you are. And I\u0027ll meet with you so we can figure some things out together. But not here, not now. Oh my God-what if he\u0027s already on his way? What if he\u0027s coming here right now?\"\n \"Funt-\"\n \"Stone Mountain. The top of Stone Mountain, eight hours from now. Just be there, and I\u0027ll find you. We\u0027ll talk.\"\n \"Please,\" Chapel begged.\n \"Not now! Not here!\"\n Funt slid the panel in his door shut with a clang. Chapel grabbed at it and tried to force it back open, tried pushing it with his fingers. Eventually it slid back a fraction of an inch. He pried it open the rest of the way and peered through, even though he knew what he would find.\n The room beyond was empty. Funt was gone.\n ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+27:21 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chimera-a-jim-chapel-mission-jim-chapel-1/page-13.html","bookId":1585,"book":{"id":1585,"title":"Chimera: A Jim Chapel Mission (Jim Chapel #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Chimera: A Jim Chapel Mission (Jim Chapel #1) \n Wounded Special Forces veteran Jim Chapel has been stuck behind a desk rather than out in the field, but medical technology has finally caught up with his ambitions.
