{"id":111104,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Chapel could only shake his head in disbelief. \"Nobody else knew where I was going to be,\" Funt insisted. \"I didn\u0027t tell anyone. So you must have told him he could find me here! You sold me out, Chapel!\" \"No! I didn\u0027t tell anyone,\" Chapel protested. Except Angel, of course. He couldn\u0027t imagine that she would have told Malcolm where to find Funt. That was just impossible. But her systems had been compromised once before, by the CIA-and the CIA had been trying to kill Funt for years. But that meant- A gunshot roared across the top of Stone Mountain, drowning out the blaring music that came from below. Chapel spun around and saw Malcolm looking down between his feet. \"Can\u0027t see very well in the dark, can you, Funt?\" the chimera asked. \"I can.\" \"Wait,\" Chapel said. \"Just wait.\" He held his hands up, outstretched, toward the chimera. \"It doesn\u0027t have to be like this. You\u0027ve been manipulated, Malcolm. You were sent here like a heat-seeking missile.\" \"I don\u0027t know what that is,\" the chimera told him. \"Just-just take my word for it. They made you come here. You\u0027re doing somebody else\u0027s bidding.\" \"You\u0027re talking about the Voice,\" Malcolm said, nodding. \"Sure-the-the voice. What voice?\" \"The Voice on the telephone. The one that told us we would be free, and then the fence came down. The one that told us where to find the ones we wanted to kill. The Voice doesn\u0027t make us do things,\" the chimera said, smiling. \"It helps us. It helps us do the things we want to do.\" Like killing Funt. Malcolm had a very good reason to want him dead. Just like the chimera in New York had good reason to want to kill Helen Bryant, the woman who made him, the woman who locked him away in an armed camp for twenty-five years. Malcolm wasn\u0027t being manipulated. Used, yes. But he was only being used to do a thing he wanted anyway. Revenge was a powerful motivator. In Special Forces training they\u0027d taught Chapel it could break through almost any disincentive-you could torture a man, you could take away everything he loved, but in the end you were only making him more resolved. They\u0027d taught him that the way to fight terrorists wasn\u0027t to punish them, but to convince them you were really on their side. \"They\u0027ll kill you when you\u0027re done,\" Chapel told the chimera. \"You do understand that, don\u0027t you? They\u0027ve already sent men to kill you. But I can keep you alive. I can protect you.\" \"I\u0027m going to kill Jeremy Funt, now, mister. It was nice talking,\" Malcolm sneered, \"but maybe you\u0027ll shut up until I\u0027m done.\" \"No!\" Funt screamed, and he fired again. The bullet ricocheted off the rock not three feet from where Chapel stood. He ducked reflexively. \"No-you don\u0027t want me. I never hurt you, Malcolm. But he\"-Funt stabbed one finger in Chapel\u0027s direction-\"he killed one of your brothers! Kill him!\" \"Wow. You think you know me so well, don\u0027t you, Jeremy Funt?\" Malcolm said, stalking toward the ex-FBI agent. \"You don\u0027t know me at all. He killed Brody, yeah. The Voice told me as much. But you know what? Where I come from, if somebody\u0027s strong enough to kill a chimera, that\u0027s something to respect. Killing us is hard. Apparently fooling us is a lot easier. That\u0027s the weakling\u0027s way.\" Funt raised his pistol again, but before he could pull the trigger Malcolm was running-leaping toward him. Chapel reached for his own sidearm and only then realized he didn\u0027t have it. It was in Funt\u0027s pocket. \"No!\" he shouted, as the chimera collided with Funt. The pistol fired, and a moment later fired again-Chapel could see the muzzle flares as explosions of light between Funt and the chimera-and then Funt\u0027s arm flew up, bending in all the wrong places. The chimera stomped on Funt\u0027s foot and the man screamed. \"No,\" Chapel shouted again, as he closed the distance between himself and the chimera. \"No!\" He locked his fingers together and swung both of his fists down, hard, into Malcolm\u0027s left kidney. The pain of getting punched there was usually enough to incapacitate a grown man. It could cause massive internal bleeding and even death and was an illegal move in boxing and every martial arts competition for good reason. It was a nasty, low blow, and Chapel had been trained to deliver it with devastating precision. It made Malcolm stop what he was doing for a fraction of a second. Chapel figured that would have to be enough. Funt was down on the ground, scrambling away from the chimera like a crab, pushing with his heels and his good arm just to escape. His pistol was gone, probably knocked out of his hand when Malcolm broke his arm. Chapel decided to stop worrying about Funt, as just then Malcolm was turning around to face him-and smiling wickedly. \"You really want some of this?\" Malcolm asked. Chapel dropped into a defensive posture, his fists raised like they were going to have a nice, friendly boxing match. \"Show me what you\u0027ve got,\" he said. The chimera came at him like a runaway train. STONE MOUNTAIN, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+36:12 There was no way Chapel could stop Malcolm, or even slow him down. The chimera was just too strong, and he outweighed Chapel by a good fifty pounds. So he didn\u0027t try to stand his ground. There was no way he could move out of the way of Malcolm\u0027s charge, either-he was just too fast. So he twisted on the ball of one foot and let Malcolm hit him, but he rolled with the bull rush, twisting around to slide over the chimera\u0027s back as he went past. Chapel landed on his feet, though not as firmly as he would have liked-the ground was too uneven to stick the landing. Still, he was suddenly behind Malcolm where Malcolm couldn\u0027t see him. If he\u0027d been fighting a human opponent, Chapel could have ended things then and there. He could have wrapped his good arm around his opponent\u0027s neck and put him in a sleeper hold. Block the blood flow to the carotid artery, even for a few seconds, and a human body will simply shut down. He knew it wouldn\u0027t be that easy. But he was out of other ideas. He brought his right knee up, hard, into the small of Malcolm\u0027s back. The chimera didn\u0027t even grunt in pain-maybe it felt like Chapel was tickling him-but he was ninety-nine percent human, which meant he had the same reflexes as a human being. He arched his back away from the blow, throwing his head back toward Chapel. Chapel threw his artificial arm around Malcolm\u0027s throat and squeezed. The prosthetic arm was designed to respond to subconscious commands. Normally Chapel didn\u0027t have to think about how the arm should move, it just acted like a real arm. He could override it, though. He could give it conscious commands and it would obey them, even in ways a real arm wouldn\u0027t. He told his arm to squeeze, and it acted like a metal noose around the chimera\u0027s neck. It tightened like a vise and stayed locked shut. A living arm could get fatigued. Its muscles were elastic enough to give way as Malcolm bucked and tried to break loose. Chapel\u0027s prosthetic arm didn\u0027t have those weaknesses. The chimera gasped and spat in rage as he tried to get free. He tried to reach around behind him, to grab Chapel and hurt him enough to make him let go. His fingers found the side of Chapel\u0027s shirt and he tore through the fabric, maybe intending to gouge into the flesh beneath. Chapel responded by using his good right arm to deliver punch after punch to the side of Malcolm\u0027s head. The chimera screamed in frustration and ducked forward, bending at the waist until he lifted Chapel right off the ground. With his arm locked around Malcolm\u0027s throat Chapel had no option but to go along for the ride. For a second he was airborne and flopping back and forth, like a rider holding on to a bucking horse. Malcolm twisted from side to side, trying to shake him free, but the only way that would happen was if Chapel\u0027s prosthetic arm gave out. Chapel forgot all about hitting Malcolm and just tried to hold on, tried to get his legs around Malcolm\u0027s waist, tried to grab the chimera with his free hand. Then Malcolm started to run-straight toward the side of the mountain. Straight toward the laser show still playing out below. No-no, he wouldn\u0027t, Chapel had time to think, as he watched the edge of the stone top of the mountain come rushing toward them. He\u0027ll kill us both! But maybe for a chimera, death was preferable to being taken prisoner again. Malcolm ran full speed toward the edge, toward a drop of more than five hundred feet. A fence ran around the edge of the mountaintop, a chain-link fence that looked about as sturdy as a lace doily from Chapel\u0027s perspective. It would catch them if Malcolm threw himself over the edge, but with their combined weight and the chimera\u0027s momentum Chapel was certain they would just tear through. He had no choice. He told his arm to let go. STONE MOUNTAIN, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+36:14 It was exactly what Malcolm had been hoping for. As soon as the pressure on his throat lessened, the chimera dug in his heels and skidded to a stop. But Chapel had no way to slow himself down, and he went shooting forward over Malcolm\u0027s shoulders and head to fly through the air, carried along by inertia straight toward the fence and the edge. He slammed into the chain link with a clattering rattle. Lasers and floodlights dazzled his eyes as he felt the chain bend and stretch. It was held up by a series of metal posts spaced about ten feet apart. The posts were anchored in the bare rock of the mountain, but they could only take so much stress. He felt the whole fence jump and dance as one post snapped off at its base, heard another one groan and shriek as the force of his impact bent it down and outward. He dug his fingers into the chain link, desperate for any kind of purchase. One sharp end of broken chain link dug into his palm, and the pain blasted up his good arm but he refused to let go, refused to even slacken his grip. He felt greasy blood smear his fingers and knew he\u0027d made a mistake. The chain link began to tilt outward, a whole section of fence collapsing under his weight. He scrabbled to climb up as it bent and twisted, but he couldn\u0027t make any headway-it was giving way faster than he could climb up. Below him the section of fencing slammed against the side of the mountain, draping over the protruding rocks and stunted trees there. Chapel fought with his panicking brain, trying to convince it that the fence was now a climbing wall, that it gave him plenty of hand- and footholds to let him climb back up, onto the mountaintop. He did one foolish thing and glanced behind himself. There was nothing beneath him but empty air and blazing lights, nothing but empty space between him and the tree-lined lower slopes of the mountain far below. It was not the kind of fall a human body could survive. Look up, damn you, he told himself, and he forced his head to crane around and peer back up at the night sky and the top of the mountain. He told his artificial fingers to lock on to the chain link, then used his good hand to reach for a grip higher up. His fingers were sore and trembling and they were slippery with blood, but he forced them through the mesh of the fence, forced them to find purchase. Carefully, slowly, he lifted his right foot and kicked at the fence to find a place to brace it, to support his weight. Above him, Malcolm walked to the edge and looked down at him. \"You\u0027re tough, for a human,\" Malcolm said. Chapel couldn\u0027t help himself. \"Your brother said the same thing right before I killed him,\" he said, through gritted teeth. He forced the toe of his shoe into a gap in the fence. Pushed himself upward a few inches. At this rate, some time next week he should reach the top. Malcolm looked away from him, and Chapel worried the chimera would just leave him there and go finish off Funt. That wasn\u0027t acceptable. \"Mind giving me a hand?\" he asked the chimera. \"So we can finish this like tough guys?\" \"No, I don\u0027t think so,\" Malcolm told him. He had something in his hands. What was it? It looked like a black plastic box, about eight inches long. What the hell was it? \"At Camp Putnam, the fences are electrified. If you touch them, they can burn your hand. We used to dare each other to go up to the fence and grab it with both hands. Somehow that was worse-if you had both hands on the fence, you couldn\u0027t let go. You could feel the electric fire running through your body, but your fingers wouldn\u0027t let go. You had to trust your brothers would knock you off the fence with a piece of wood.\" \"That\u0027s some kind of messed-up trust exercise,\" Chapel gasped. He lifted his left foot, but it just slid off the fencing every time he tried to get a toehold. \"Some brothers would do it. Some of them would save you. Others wouldn\u0027t. They would just sit there and watch while you cooked like a bird. It was an important lesson to learn. We were brothers, but we were not friends. We did not owe each other anything, even our lives. A chimera can only really trust himself. So when you told me you would help me, you would protect me, that\u0027s what I heard. Don\u0027t worry. I won\u0027t let you cook alive.\" \"Is there a point to this?\" Chapel asked. Malcolm held up his plastic box. Chapel saw now it had two metal prongs sticking out of one end. As he watched a spark jumped between them. It was a stun gun. Capable of delivering fifty thousand volts of electricity to anything it touched. \"No,\" Chapel said. \"No, Malcolm-\" \"A man in a stupid hat tried to use this on me, down below.\" Chapel thought of the park ranger who\u0027d failed to radio in. \"It didn\u0027t work. I\u0027m guessing it must work on humans, or he wouldn\u0027t have been carrying it. You\u0027re tough, for a human. But humans just aren\u0027t much, in the end.\" Malcolm lowered the stun gun and touched its prongs to the fence. STONE MOUNTAIN, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+36:21 Chapel had been tased before. It had been part of his training, a ritual everyone in his Special Forces program had to go through. You had to know what it felt like, so if it happened in the field you would be ready. Except there really was no good way to ready yourself. There was nothing you could do to brace against it. Nothing you could do to stop it taking over your body. The pain was intense, worse than any kick in the groin, maybe worse, Chapel thought, than getting shot. It felt like your entire body was on fire all at once, like you\u0027d been thrown into a furnace. Worse than that-like you were being burned alive from the inside out. Every muscle in his body twitched and cramped. His spine arched and his teeth slammed together, cutting deep into the side of his tongue. His eyes squeezed shut, and tears burst from under their lids. It was a horrible violation for a man used to being in total control of his own flesh. He barely managed not to soil himself. It was all over in a fraction of a second. But after that came the realization. The horror. His good fingers had let go of the fence. His feet were kicking at air. He didn\u0027t dare open his eyes. The fall would be brief and the sudden impact would probably kill him instantly. A human body falling hundreds of feet had plenty of time to reach terminal velocity. There would be little left of him but a stain on the ground when he hit bottom. Goodbye, Julia, he had time to think. I hope you- Funny. Definitely weird. He didn\u0027t feel like he was falling. There was no sensation of weightlessness, no rush of air past his face. He opened his eyes and saw he hadn\u0027t fallen at all. Looking up, he saw that he was dangling, limp as a rag doll, by one hand. His prosthetic hand. Of course. The silicone skin that covered his robotic hand was an excellent insulator. The burst of electricity couldn\u0027t get through even a thin sheet of the rubbery stuff. The fingers were locked in place, holding him up. He would have laughed-except he found he could barely breathe. The clamps on the end of the arm, the clamps that held it on his body, were designed to tighten automatically when needed, squeezing tighter with the more weight the arm tried to lift. At that moment the arm was holding his entire one hundred and eighty pounds. The clamps had compressed so tightly they were crushing his rib cage, making it difficult for him to draw breath. The arm hadn\u0027t been designed for this. It had never been meant to hold so much weight on its own. He had to get his good hand up there, had to grab the fence- Up above Malcolm screamed in rage and hit the fence again with the stun gun. Chapel barely had time to yank his fingers back from the chain link. It was then he started to smell burning rubber. He looked up and saw the fingers of his artificial hand were smoking. Molten silicone was rolling down the back of the hand, dripping down his shirtsleeve. If the silicone melted until the metal finger actuators beneath were exposed, he would have no protection from the electric shocks. The current running through the fence would zap the arm\u0027s circuit boards and microchips and short it out. If that happened, the fingers were designed to automatically release anything they were holding. They would go limp, and he would fall. He couldn\u0027t let that happen. \"Malcolm!\" he shouted, sucking in a deep breath so he could actually be heard. \"Malcolm, listen to me!\" The chimera stared down at him with wide black eyes. \"What the hell are you, human?\" Malcolm demanded. \"Or are you human? Maybe you\u0027re like me. Maybe . . .\" He shook his head, failing to finish his thought. He grabbed at his hair and pulled until clumps of it came loose. He was getting frustrated. Which for a chimera could only mean one thing-he was getting even more dangerous than he\u0027d been before. \"Malcolm,\" Chapel called, \"wouldn\u0027t you rather kill me with your own hands? Wouldn\u0027t that be more satisfying?\" \"Shut up!\" Malcolm shrieked, his voice suddenly high pitched with rage. \"Shut the fuck up! I\u0027m going to eat you, do you understand? I\u0027m going to tear off your flesh and eat it! I\u0027m going to trample Funt until he\u0027s paste! Then I\u0027m going to take your woman and I\u0027m going to fu-\" The chimera\u0027s head jerked to one side. His black eyes blinked several times. A dark spot appeared on the front of his shirt and started to spread. He didn\u0027t say anything, or make any sound at all. As quickly as it had possessed him, the rage seemed to have flowed back out of him. He raised one hand to touch the spot on his shirt, and his fingers came away dark. A scowl curled across his face. Then his left eye exploded outward in a miniature cloud of blood. STONE MOUNTAIN, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+36:28 It took as long for Malcolm to fall over as a tree takes to fall in the forest. Chapel could only stare upward, watching in surprise as the chimera died. Malcolm slumped to the ground in a heap, one hand flopping forward over the fence, as if he were reaching out a hand toward Chapel, a final gesture of reconciliation. Blood rolled down his fingers and dripped on the mountain below. Eventually Chapel remembered he was about to fall to his death. He stuffed the fingers of his good hand into the chain link, and some of the strain was taken off his artificial arm and he could almost breathe again. Julia popped her head over the side. \"Chapel?\" she asked. \"Are you-\" \"Make sure he\u0027s dead!\" Chapel called up. She nodded and disappeared for a moment. Chapel heard two more gunshots. When she came back, she was holding Funt\u0027s pistol and the barrel was smoking. \"Can you climb up?\" she asked. She looked from side to side. \"This fence isn\u0027t going to hold much longer.\" In that case, Chapel told himself, the answer to her question had better be yes. He shoved one foot into a gap in the fence and pushed himself upward. His artificial fingers had partially fused to the chain link, but he was able to pull them free. Semiliquid silicone came loose in long thin strands. The fingers were gummed together and deformed but they still worked, it seemed. \"Hang on,\" Julia said. She pulled off her pink hoodie, then tied one end of it to a fence post that was still holding in the rock. When she lowered the other sleeve down to him, he could almost reach it. It took him far too long to climb up and grab it. The chain link groaned and started to tear away from its posts, and for a bad, long moment he was certain it would give way. Eventually, though, he managed to clamber up to a point where he could wrap his good arm around a fence post and, with Julia\u0027s help, roll back onto the level ground on top of the mountain. Julia stared at him as if he would disappear if she looked away even for a moment. She reached up and brushed hair out of her face with one hand, leaving a streak of blood on her cheek. \"Blood,\" Chapel managed to say, pointing at it. Chimera blood. Full of the virus. She understood at once. \"Oh, God-I checked Malcolm\u0027s pulse with those fingers. I didn\u0027t even think . . .\" Shaking her head she grabbed up the hoodie and used it to scrape the blood off her face and hands. Would it be enough to protect her? Chapel didn\u0027t know. If she hadn\u0027t gotten the blood in any cuts or scrapes, if it hadn\u0027t got in her mouth- There was nothing to be done for it. \"Funt,\" Chapel said. He was still getting his breath back. He didn\u0027t know if he could sit up quite yet. \"Is Funt alive?\" Julia nodded. \"He\u0027s in shock, though. I did what I could for him. That\u0027s why it took me so long to shoot Malcolm.\" \"That\u0027s the second person you\u0027ve shot today,\" Chapel said, with a weak smile. \"You\u0027re a quick learner.\" He started to close his eyes. \"I\u0027m getting better at it. Chapel? Chapel, what do we do now?\" \"We have to get out of here.\" \"Definitely. Funt needs medical attention. More than I can give him up here. And the park rangers will probably show up any second. I know I don\u0027t want to have to explain to them what happened.\" \"My phone,\" Chapel said. Very carefully he reached into the inside pocket and found the smartphone. He touched his ear and found his hands-free set was long gone, probably knocked out of his ear when Malcolm threw him at the fence. He dialed Angel and she picked up almost at once. \"I\u0027m here, baby.\" \"Angel, we need to be extracted, as soon as you can-\" He stopped talking because the sound of the music coming from the bottom of the mountain was drowned out just then by the rotor noise of a helicopter coming over the far side of the summit. It was a civilian chopper, but it showed no lights. \"Anything else I can do for you?\" Angel asked. STONE MOUNTAIN, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+36:31 The chopper seemed to take forever to land-the top of Stone Mountain was too rough for it to just set down on its skids. Eventually the pilot found a safe spot, and the aircraft settled to the rock. The same second it put down, two men wearing Tyvek suits and surgical masks came running over to put Malcolm in a body bag. They didn\u0027t even look at Chapel, but Julia grabbed the arm of one of them and asked if he had any alcohol wipes. He handed her a bottle of rubbing alcohol from his kit, and she poured it liberally over her fingers, then scrubbed at her face with the stuff. \"We have a wounded man over there,\" she said, pointing at where Funt lay, dressed as a park ranger, on the bare rock. \"Sorry, ma\u0027am, we\u0027re just cleanup. But there\u0027s a stretcher in the bird,\" he told her. She started to protest, but Chapel grasped her shoulder and then ran to the chopper. The pilot was already pulling the stretcher out of the back compartment. \"I have orders to take you wherever you want to go,\" he told Chapel. \"But I\u0027ll need to file a flight plan before we take off.\" \"The closest airport is fine,\" Chapel told him. \"Help me get this man onboard,\" he said, pointing at Funt. \"Are we taking the body as well?\" \"No, a second craft is coming for that. The two medics I brought will guard the body until it arrives. I don\u0027t suppose you can tell me what\u0027s going on here? I\u0027m not even supposed to be on this shift.\" \"Where are you stationed?\" Chapel asked. \"Fort McPherson, sir,\" the pilot told him. \"Oh, so you\u0027re army,\" Chapel said, nodding. \"So you\u0027ll understand when I say no, I can\u0027t tell you anything.\" \"Sir, yes, sir,\" the pilot said, shaking his head. Together they loaded Funt onto the stretcher and carried it back to the chopper. The ex-FBI man didn\u0027t wake up. His face was bright with sweat, and when Julia came over and pulled one of his eyelids back, the eye underneath failed to track. \"His body knows best,\" she told Chapel, when he asked if Funt was going to be all right. \"When he wakes up, he\u0027s going to be in incredible pain-that arm is shattered. So his body put him to sleep. We should leave him that way if we can, though we need to keep him warm. His body temperature is very low.\" Chapel nodded and put his phone to his ear. \"Angel, we\u0027ve got Funt and he\u0027s alive but badly hurt. This chopper\u0027s going to take us to an airport nearby. Can you have an ambulance waiting?\" \"I\u0027m on it,\" Angel said. Julia jumped into the back of the chopper where she could sit with Funt and keep an eye on him. Chapel ran around the nose of the aircraft so he could take the copilot seat. Before he got in, though, he took one last look at the top of Stone Mountain-and the body of the second dead chimera he\u0027d seen in two days. \"Angel,\" Chapel said, \"what are they going to do with Malcolm?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chimera-a-jim-chapel-mission-jim-chapel-1/page-17.html","bookId":1585,"book":{"id":1585,"title":"Chimera: A Jim Chapel Mission (Jim Chapel #1)","description":"Storyline: Chimera: A Jim Chapel Mission (Jim Chapel #1) Wounded Special Forces veteran Jim Chapel has been stuck behind a desk rather than out in the field, but medical technology has finally caught up with his ambitions.
