{"id":111114,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\"Angel,\" Chapel said, \"I didn\u0027t know.\" \"No, Chapel, of course you didn\u0027t. None of us did. We never stopped to ask where the chimeras came from.\" Chapel had imagined they must have been grown in vats somewhere, fetuses floating in glass tubes in some dark laboratory. When he thought about it now, that seemed ridiculous. That kind of technology didn\u0027t even exist. Whereas even in 1984 it would have been child\u0027s play for a scientist like William Taggart to implant embryos in unsuspecting women all over the country. The thought made him gag a little. \"I suppose we can assume Olivia Nguyen and Christina Smollett underwent the same . . . procedure,\" Chapel said. He stopped talking then. He wanted to ask more questions, but with CPO Andrews lying next to him it felt like it would be in bad taste to continue his line of thought. \"Maybe we should talk about this later,\" he said. CPO Andrews turned to face him again. Her mouth was set in a hard line. \"No,\" she said. \"No. This is inexcusable. You\u0027re a man, and I don\u0027t expect you to understand the level of violation we\u0027re talking about.\" \"I guess you\u0027re right about that,\" Chapel admitted. \"But even worse,\" Andrews said, and she pressed her lips tightly closed for a moment as if she couldn\u0027t bear to speak, but then went on, \"even worse than what the government did-would be to just keep it secret. To not do something.\" Chapel nodded slowly. \"This isn\u0027t about hunting down the chimeras anymore. Not for me. It\u0027s about finding out what was done back in 1984 and 1985, and finding out who\u0027s responsible.\" \"Good. You find them. And you make them pay,\" Andrews told him. \"Go on. Talk to Angel. Work this case. I insist.\" He watched her eyes for a second. Then he said, \"Angel, there were two hundred chimeras born in 1985. Why do we only have three names on our list?\" \"I\u0027ve been wondering that myself,\" Angel said, over the speakerphone. \"I don\u0027t have a concrete answer. My best guess is that only these three women represented a threat to the project\u0027s secrecy.\" \"I don\u0027t follow,\" Chapel said. \"It\u0027s ugly to think about, but it makes sense why the CIA chose these women to be the mothers of the chimeras. The project was always top secret, but they needed two hundred women of the appropriate age and relative health. That\u0027s a huge security risk. They picked women with emotional problems because they were less likely to understand what was happening to them, or to talk about it afterward-and even if they did, nobody would believe them. Christina Smollett, for instance, or maybe her father figured out some of it and sued the CIA. The case was thrown out because the judge assumed she was just . . . crazy. That she\u0027d hallucinated the whole thing, or whatever. The secret was safe, but still, it meant she was enough of a threat to get on the list. Marcia Kennedy is a relatively lucid woman. She guessed what was done to her, and maybe I wasn\u0027t the first person she talked to about it. So that gets her on the list, too. As for Olivia Nguyen, I looked up her records and she suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. She has long stretches where she appears to be perfectly healthy-that\u0027s common with her diagnosis-but she has a habit of keeping knives under her mattress, and sometimes she thinks the songs she hears on the radio are a government plot to drive her crazy.\" \"A government plot-\" \"Yeah,\" Angel said. \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027s aware of what was done to her, or who did it. But she writes a lot of letters to the editor of the local newspaper talking about the government. A few of them even get printed. They\u0027re quite well written, and it takes a while before you realize they\u0027re the product of a disordered mind. They never contain anything specific enough to endanger the secrecy of the chimera project but maybe the CIA doesn\u0027t want to take the chance that someday she\u0027ll get more focused, more coherent.\" \"So they want her dead just in case,\" Chapel said. \"Even though she\u0027s never done anything to hurt them. So she\u0027s on the list.\" \"Chapel, there\u0027s one thing I don\u0027t understand. Why the chimeras?\" \"You mean, why were they created, or-\" \"No,\" Angel said. \"I mean, why send the chimeras to kill their own mothers?\" Chapel hadn\u0027t even considered that before. \"Because they know the chimeras will do it,\" he said, at last. \"The people who are running this plot, they don\u0027t care about who gave birth to who. They just know how to manipulate the chimeras. They know the chimeras hate the people who created them, and then abandoned them. It wouldn\u0027t take much to convince a chimera to kill his biological mother. Even if she never knew he existed. They can\u0027t think through their emotions.\" \"But why even take that chance? Why not just send Laughing Boy to kill these women?\" Chapel frowned. \"Plausible deniability,\" he said. \"There\u0027s always the risk somebody will see Laughing Boy shoot the people on the kill list. Some chance someone will put two and two together and realize the government is assassinating its own citizens. But if it\u0027s just some big, obviously crazy guy who kills these people, well, the world knows that happens sometimes. No one will investigate too deeply.\" \"I don\u0027t want to think about this. I don\u0027t want to know these things,\" Angel said. \"Chapel-what\u0027s your next move?\" \"I don\u0027t know yet,\" he told her. \"Let me think about it.\" SUPERIOR, COLORADO: APRIL 15, T+72:14 Eventually Julia decided that the transfusion had gone on long enough. Chapel was still short on blood, but CPO Andrews could only donate so much before her own health was at risk. Julia came back into the motel room and removed the needles from their arms. CPO Andrews got up slowly from the bed and then excused herself to go in the bathroom and wash her face. Julia checked Chapel\u0027s pulse and looked into his eyes, checking the response of his pupils. She rubbed his arm down with an antibacterial solution and then put a small adhesive bandage over the puncture. \"How do you feel?\" she asked. \"Better. A lot better, thanks to you.\" Julia nodded and looked away. He reached over and took her hand. \"You saved my life. Again.\" \"I had a lot of help.\" She started to pull away. \"Julia,\" he said, \"just talk to me for a second. Okay?\" She made an irritated noise and pulled her hand away. But she didn\u0027t move away from him. \"What is there to talk about?\" she asked. \"I need to know if you\u0027re okay,\" he told her. \"No one shot me and left me to bleed out. I\u0027m fine.\" \"Physically, sure. But you\u0027ve learned a lot of things recently that I\u0027m sure you didn\u0027t want to know.\" He leaned over and put his arm around her. She didn\u0027t push him away. \"I know about emotional trauma. A lot of the guys I served with in Afghanistan came back suffering from PTSD. They couldn\u0027t just return to their normal lives, not with what they\u0027d become over there. They couldn\u0027t sleep. They couldn\u0027t talk to their wives or children without getting angry, without blowing up. Some of them just shut down, stopped talking or stopped getting out of bed.\" \"I\u0027m not-I\u0027m handling this as best I can,\" Julia said. \"Chapel, this was my family doing all these things. My mom and my dad forcibly impregnated all those women. They raised the chimeras like their own children, and then they locked them up and threw away the key.\" Chapel pulled her closer. She laid her head on his shoulder. \"When I was a teenager, sitting in my room listening to Nirvana on my headphones and wondering which boys at school liked me, they were . . . they were out at that camp. They were there looking after their other kids, their two hundred sons. Training a whole generation of psychotic killers. I don\u0027t . . .\" She stopped because tears had crowded up in her eyes and she couldn\u0027t seem to speak until they\u0027d all squirted down her cheeks. \"It\u0027s like my entire life was a lie. A cover story. I was their cover story. Their alibi. That was the whole reason I existed.\" She rubbed at her eyes with the balls of her thumbs. \"I don\u0027t understand it! I don\u0027t understand any of it! I don\u0027t know who I am anymore. Last week I was a veterinarian in New York City, with a crummy little apartment and an OkCupid profile I checked every once in a while and a standing date to have lunch with my mother every week. Who am I now?\" \"You\u0027re the same person,\" Chapel said. \"I shot a man\u0027s foot half off! I killed one of my brothers. My mom is gone, and my dad is probably going to die, and honestly-honestly, Chapel, and it bothers me, absolutely disgusts me to say this, but I think maybe he deserves it. I kind of want him to die to pay for what he did. How can I feel that way about my father? This isn\u0027t Julia Taggart, DVM! This isn\u0027t me!\" Chapel held her for a long time without saying a word. She was done with tears, but she rocked back and forth slowly, clutching her hands together in front of her. Clearly she\u0027d needed this, needed to vent like this, for a long time. He\u0027d been too busy chasing his mad quest to give her the chance. Eventually she slowed her rocking and she just leaned into him, crowded up against him until they fell back on the bed and just lay there together. He stroked her hair, and she just breathed, breathed and did nothing else. \"I know how you feel,\" he told her. \"Come on,\" she whispered. \"Every soldier knows how you feel.\" \"I\u0027m no soldier,\" she moaned. \"No. But listen. When you enlist in the military, you\u0027re just some kid. You grew up, went to high school, maybe you got in some trouble or maybe you just didn\u0027t know what else to do with your life, maybe you wanted to serve your country but frankly, a lot of soldiers I know just were looking for something to do. So they go to boot camp and everything about you is broken down. Everything you think you know about yourself is challenged and tested and evaluated. Then you get shipped overseas right into a war zone. People are trying to kill you all the time. Sometimes you have to try to kill other people. Everything you ever learned in church or in school or from your friends has to be put aside, put on hold, just so you can survive through another day. You give up every shred of who you were, who you thought you were, so you can be something else. Something that can fight, and will fight. Something that will survive no matter what.\" \"Jesus,\" Julia said. \"Why would anyone choose that?\" \"It\u0027s hard to explain, but . . . you\u0027re surrounded by other people just like you. People going through the same thing. They watch your back and keep you alive. You do the same for them because there\u0027s nobody else who can. You get through every day because if you fail, if you lower your guard even for a moment, your friends might die. Friends isn\u0027t even the right word. They\u0027re more than that. There\u0027s no good term at all for what your buddies become. But that\u0027s the compensation. It\u0027s the consolation for all the horror you face. You get these people in your life, these people who mean everything to you, and you know they feel exactly the same way about you. You\u0027d never say it. They would tease the hell out of you if you did. But you love them.\" \"You . . . do?\" Julia asked. Maybe because she understood what he was trying to say to her. \"Believe it,\" he told her. \"Believe it. When you\u0027re a soldier, you\u0027re not alone. You are never alone.\" She pressed her face against his chest, and he just held her, held her close, because he knew that was exactly what she needed. SUPERIOR, COLORADO: APRIL 15, T+73:21 After she\u0027d rested for a bit, CPO Andrews went out and got some food and other supplies-some antibiotic cream for Chapel\u0027s various wounds, new clothes for both Chapel and Julia, some toiletries for all of them and three disposable cell phones so that they could all stay in touch with Angel. Andrews and Julia both had their own phones, but they were afraid to use them. None of them were sure what was going to happen to them, whether CIA agents were hunting them down even then. \"Laughing Boy could be coming here, right now,\" Julia pointed out. \"I\u0027m actually more worried about Hollingshead,\" Chapel told her. CPO Andrews found the idea shocking-that was her boss he was talking about-but she\u0027d worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency long enough to know it wasn\u0027t impossible. \"He sent me to Denver,\" Chapel explained, \"and I\u0027m sure he knew what was waiting there for me. I pushed him too hard when I investigated Camp Putnam. I wasn\u0027t supposed to see that place. Now I\u0027m a liability. Angel,\" he said, because she was always listening via the speakerphone, \"I don\u0027t know how you left things with him-\" \"I told him you\u0027re dead,\" she answered. \"Oh,\" Chapel said. \"Judge Hayes had announced as much in his press conference. He claimed he had your body and was going to turn it over to the Denver county coroner. Director Hollingshead sounded pretty upset when I confirmed it.\" \"I\u0027ll just bet he did,\" Chapel said, frowning. Hollingshead was an excellent spymaster, and that meant he had to be an excellent actor, sometimes. CPO Andrews shook her head. \"I don\u0027t get it. Why would he want you dead? He chose you to track down the chimeras. There\u0027s still one at large. Why would he want you dead now?\" \"Because while I was so busy digging up CIA secrets-which suited him just fine, since he\u0027s at war with Director Banks over there-I accidentally turned up one of his.\" Chapel sat down on the bed and reached for a plastic container full of roasted chicken. He was starving. Blood loss could do that to you, he knew. \"Rupert Hollingshead was in on the chimera project from the beginning. I\u0027m pretty sure he ran the whole thing.\" No one spoke. The two women in the motel room stared at him. He was sure Angel was listening intently, too. Chapel took a bite, chewed, swallowed. Wiped his hands on a napkin. \"In 1990, Ellie Pechowski was recruited to teach the chimeras. She was recruited by a captain in the navy. It\u0027s funny how ranks work-I\u0027m a captain in the army, but that\u0027s not the same rank. In the navy-\" \"Captain is O-6, one rank below O-7, a one-star rear admiral,\" CPO Andrews said. \"You\u0027re talking about my branch, now.\" Chapel nodded. \"Captain Hollingshead was the one who recruited Pechowski. When we talked about her, he called her Ellie Pechowski, not Eleanor. Only people who know her call her Ellie.\" He took another bite. \"I can\u0027t prove it. But I think he probably recruited William Taggart and Helen Bryant as well. I think he was the commanding officer at Camp Putnam. I think the chimera project wasn\u0027t a CIA project at all. I think it was a Department of Defense project all along.\" \"That\u0027s-that\u0027s-\" CPO Andrews couldn\u0027t seem to accept it. \"It makes sense. It makes a lot of sense,\" Angel said. \"It explains why Camp Putnam is a DoD facility, and why Hollingshead was the one who captured you when you went there, not Banks.\" Chapel nodded. He didn\u0027t like this much. He wished it weren\u0027t true. But the evidence kept mounting. \"I think he\u0027s been lying to me-to us-all along. For one thing, I don\u0027t think there even is a virus.\" \"What?\" Julia asked, laughing as if the idea was ludicrous. \"Think about it,\" Chapel said. \"Ellie Pechowski and your parents had constant exposure to the chimeras for years. But nobody ever treated them like Typhoid Mary. They were never quarantined, and until now nobody tried to kill them.\" \"No virus,\" Julia said, staring at her hands. \"But . . . Laughing Boy . . .\" \"They claim he\u0027s tracking down anyone who might be exposed. That\u0027s a great cover story. It lets him kill anyone who might be a witness-there won\u0027t be any serious oversight if Banks can claim that Laughing Boy is just controlling the outbreak of a weaponized virus. Even the president would sign off on that. But it also means Laughing Boy can kill anyone who even saw a chimera. Hollingshead and the DoD started this thing. Banks is trying to erase it from history. That\u0027s what this has all been about. I understand the kill list now. I know why those people were chosen to die. They\u0027re the only ones who know what happened. The only people who could bear witness to what Hollingshead did.\" \"Which means,\" Angel pointed out, \"that everyone in this room is on that list-and I am, too.\" \"They want to kill us,\" Julia said. \"Yes,\" Chapel told her. \"Okay. How do we stop them?\" SUPERIOR, COLORADO: APRIL 15, T+74:22 Chapel gave her a warm smile. \"I have an idea about that. It means getting your father-alive-to someone who\u0027ll listen. Congress, maybe. Or the media if that\u0027s not an option. We make this thing part of the public record. Expose the secret. Tell the world what they did to those two hundred women.\" Julia and CPO Andrews both seemed to like the idea. Chapel wasn\u0027t as crazy about it, himself. It was treason. It was breaking every rule he\u0027d ever learned as a spy. But it was the only way out of this. \"We have one advantage,\" Chapel said. He reached for the new shirt Andrews had bought him and started pulling it on. \"They think I\u0027m dead. Angel, what did you tell Hollingshead about Julia?\" \"He thinks she\u0027s on a train headed back to New York City. I considered telling him that CPO Andrews was taking her back on the jet, but it would be too easy for him to track that. She has to file a flight plan every time she moves to a new location.\" \"If you\u0027re headed for Alaska, I\u0027ll take you, of course,\" Andrews said. \"But by that same reasoning he\u0027ll know right away that you\u0027re alive, as soon as he checks the flight records. There would be no other reason for me to take the plane to Alaska.\" \"We\u0027ll just have to risk it. Hope that he\u0027s preoccupied and doesn\u0027t check those records, at least not until we\u0027ve got Taggart. It puts even more time pressure on us, but I don\u0027t see any other way to get there in a hurry. How soon can you have the jet ready?\" \"Hold on,\" Julia said. Chapel stopped buttoning his shirt to face her. \"You lost nearly half your entire blood volume,\" she said. \"And got it back, from the transfusion. I feel fine,\" he insisted. \"I\u0027m sure you feel great. People always do after getting new blood. You\u0027re still weak, regardless of how you feel. You were shot, Chapel. You have a gunshot wound. You shouldn\u0027t be going anywhere except a hospital.\" \"We don\u0027t have time,\" he told her. \"Believe me, I get it. All our lives are at stake. And I hear what you\u0027re saying, that we have to move quickly before they come for us. But if your wound reopens in the middle of a firefight, or you just collapse from anemia . . . I don\u0027t know how I\u0027ll feel about that. I can\u0027t just let you kill yourself, Chapel.\" \" \u0027First do no harm,\u0027 right? That\u0027s the oath they made you swear?\" \"I\u0027m not a people doctor. My oath said something about only using my skills for the benefit of society. Whatever. I\u0027m not saying this as your veterinarian. I\u0027m saying it as your . . . buddy.\" Chapel reached out and put his hand on her arm. She didn\u0027t shy away. For a long moment they just stared into each other\u0027s eyes. \"Angel,\" CPO Andrews said, \"can you book these two a room? Another room, I mean?\" Julia and Chapel turned to face her as one. \"What?\" they both asked. The CPO just smiled knowingly. \"Are you going to try to stop me from going to Alaska?\" Chapel asked Julia. \"I guess not. Just consider it to be against medical advice.\" Julia turned around and started gathering up her things. \"It\u0027ll be cold in Alaska. It\u0027s probably still winter there. Angel, can you order us some parkas? And maybe some nice, warm boots.\" \"I\u0027ll have them sent to the plane,\" the speakerphone told her. IN TRANSIT: APRIL 15, T+75:37 There were no mandarin oranges or goat cheese salads left on the jet-the tiny galley had never been meant to be used so often. Besides, it felt wrong to ask CPO Andrews to act like a stewardess now that she was part of their conspiracy. The three of them waited for takeoff together and ate cold chicken, the remains of the meal Andrews had gathered in Boulder. On the table between the jet\u0027s seats lay a cell phone, a cheap disposable flip phone that they left open so Angel could join their conversation. There was no need for hands-free sets now, since Chapel wanted Julia and Andrews to hear everything that was said. \"It\u0027s five and a half hours in the air to reach Fairbanks International,\" CPO Andrews told them. \"That\u0027s the closest airport to the address we have for William Taggart. Probably another hour in ground transport. That probably means snowmobiles, of all things. My weather data says it\u0027s still very much winter up there-the snowpack won\u0027t melt until May-and there are drifts five feet deep in the surrounding areas.\" \"Snowmachines,\" Chapel said. \"In Alaska, they have snowmachines, not snowmobiles.\" \"What\u0027s the difference?\" Julia asked. \"In Alaska, they\u0027re called snowmachines. Everywhere else they\u0027re called snowmobiles.\" Julia stuck her tongue out at him and he laughed. It was good to see her smiling again. He\u0027d worried that the trauma she\u0027d endured might have broken her spirit. Of course, every time he\u0027d thought the woman must surely be at the end of her rope, she\u0027d surprised him by coming back stronger. He should have expected no less. \"Angel,\" Chapel said, \"assuming Ian was traveling by train, how long would it take him to reach Fairbanks?\" \"It\u0027s hard to say. There\u0027s no direct rail service-Amtrak only takes you as far as Vancouver,\" Angel answered. Chapel could hear her clacking away at her keyboard. \"If he was driving a car, it would take three days and nine hours, but of course, he won\u0027t know how to drive. So it has to be longer than that, given the weird ground transportation options he\u0027s looking at. How much longer I can only estimate. Say, a minimum of three and a half days.\" Chapel checked his watch. \"So we\u0027ll still arrive before him. It\u0027ll be close, but we\u0027ll make it.\" Everyone sighed a deep breath of relief. \"What about Laughing Boy?\" Chapel asked. \"Have you had any luck tracking him?\" Angel sounded apologetic. \"No. He checked himself out of the hospital in Atlanta shortly after you left Stone Mountain. Since then he\u0027s been a ghost. I did find out one thing you\u0027re not going to like. There was a fire at the visitors\u0027 center on Stone Mountain. A bunch of park rangers died. I think we can assume that was no accident.\" Chapel leaned forward in his seat. \"What about Jeremy Funt?\" \"Still in a hospital in Georgia. Still under armed guard-guards sent there by Director Hollingshead,\" Angel pointed out. \"Banks may very well want him dead, but Hollingshead is protecting him.\" Chapel nodded. He had a sudden hunch. \"What about Ellie Pechowski? Have you been in touch with her at all?\" \"She\u0027s very much alive, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re asking. Do you want me to go down the list? Ellie, Marcia Kennedy, Olivia Nguyen, and Christina Smollett are all fine; there\u0027s no sign they\u0027ve been visited by the CIA or anybody else who might wish them harm. I got a phone call from Marcia Kennedy just an hour ago, asking if it was still dangerous for her to go outside. I told her yes, but I think you were right, that Laughing Boy needs to have proof someone\u0027s been exposed to the virus before he can kill them. I think they\u0027re safe, as long as Ian doesn\u0027t come to see them.\" \"That\u0027s what we\u0027re going to try to stop, now,\" Chapel told her. \"I almost hate to ask, but what about Franklin Hayes?\" \"Perfectly healthy,\" Angel told him, \"and giving nonstop press conferences. He\u0027s still reporting that you\u0027re dead, that you died saving him from Quinn.\" \"Wishful thinking,\" Chapel said. \"He\u0027s probably assuming Laughing Boy will kill me before I can prove him wrong.\" \"In the press conferences, whenever he talks about the \u0027assassin,\u0027 he always uses the term \u0027domestic terrorist.\u0027 There\u0027s been no release of information concerning Quinn\u0027s identity-or the fact that he wasn\u0027t quite human. The media\u0027s going crazy with the story, though, trying to link Quinn to everyone from Timothy McVeigh to the Unabomber to the Earth Liberation Front. Both sides, Democrats and Republicans, have been quick to blame the lunatic fringe of the other party. I\u0027m guessing that Franklin Hayes won\u0027t be getting any tricky questions at his confirmation hearing when he goes before the Senate. If they stop short of giving him a Bronze Star, I\u0027ll be surprised.\" \"Civilians aren\u0027t eligible for that medal. You can only earn it during wartime.\" Angel laughed. \"Honey, they\u0027re already calling him a frontline veteran of the culture wars.\" Chapel fumed, but he had worse enemies to face yet. Maybe someday, when the case was broken wide open, he\u0027d have a chance to tell the real story and take Franklin Hayes down a peg. Maybe. IN TRANSIT: APRIL 15, T+76:06 Once they were in the air, CPO Andrews brought a bottle of Scotch and three tumblers out of the galley and they all shared a drink. \"This is good stuff. Sorry you can\u0027t join in, Angel,\" Chapel said, as he sipped at the brown liquor. \"I\u0027ve got a Red Bull here and some leftover Chinese food,\" Angel told him over the phone that lay on the table. \"Works for me.\" Chapel exhaled deeply and lay back in his seat. \"We should all try to get some sleep,\" he said, and the women agreed. CPO Andrews helped them recline the seats so they became full, comfortable beds. She dimmed the cabin lights and then headed back toward her galley. \"You\u0027re not going to sleep in one of these things?\" Julia asked. \"I have a bunk back there and a little TV set,\" Andrews said, shrugging. Chapel thought she might have winked at Julia, but he couldn\u0027t be sure. \"I\u0027ll be fine.\" Before she left, Chapel had one question for her. He glanced toward the front of the cabin, toward the jet\u0027s cockpit. \"I\u0027ve never seen the pilot of this plane,\" he said. \"No, and you won\u0027t,\" Andrews told him. \"He has his own exit from the cockpit, and he never needs to come back here. Hollingshead wanted it that way-he holds all kinds of meetings in this jet, and the things he has to say aren\u0027t for everyone\u0027s ears. Don\u0027t worry about the pilot. He has no idea what we\u0027re up to, and he doesn\u0027t want to know. He\u0027s cleared to receive my orders about where we fly to and that\u0027s it. If we need to communicate with him or vice versa, there\u0027s an intercom system, but it\u0027s only used in emergencies.\" Chapel nodded. It was for the best, of course. CPO Andrews had probably wrecked her career already by conspiring with him and Julia. There was no need for the pilot to be implicated. \"Good night,\" Andrews said, and she headed aft. \"Good night,\" he told her. He lay down in his seat-turned-bed and grabbed a blanket. Before he could pull it over himself, though, Julia came and lay down next to him, spooning up against him in the seat. He didn\u0027t ask why. Frankly, he was glad for her warmth lying against him. Julia said nothing. She pulled a pillow around to support her head, pulled the blanket up over their shoulders, and was probably out like a light. Maybe she was learning a few things, like how to sleep anywhere and whenever she was given the chance. He regretted that she\u0027d had to learn that. Or what it felt like to kill a man. But he was grateful she\u0027d been there-grateful that she\u0027d saved his life so many times, but also just grateful that he\u0027d gotten a chance to know her. To be with her. For a long while he just lay next to her, watching her red hair stir in front of his face, blowing this way and that with his breath. Eventually he lifted his arm and gently placed it around her waist. \"Mrmph,\" she muttered, and snuggled back against him some more. The smell of her, the presence of her, filled his senses. It was like they were alone, floating on a cloud high over the mountains, high above the world. He couldn\u0027t help it. He leaned forward and kissed the back of her neck. In response she brought her hand down and placed it over his.
