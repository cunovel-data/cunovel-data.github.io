I-\"\n He turned to look at Julia, but she was already storming out of the examining room. \"I\u0027ve got work to do,\" she said, and slammed the door behind her.\n \"I\u0027m alone now,\" he told Angel.\n \"That\u0027s good. I like having you all to myself,\" she told him. \"Tell me you\u0027re okay. Your vitals look all right, though you seem tired.\"\n \"It\u0027s been a long day. Wait a minute-you can tell I\u0027m tired from the earpiece?\"\n \"It\u0027s got a few sneaky features. It can collect biometric data. Among other things.\"\n \"And those other things-\"\n \"Sweetie, if you ask me about classified things, you know I have to lie. And I don\u0027t ever want to lie to you.\"\n \"Fair enough. All right, Angel. What\u0027s so important you needed to cut in on me like that?\"\n \"I\u0027m going to put Director Hollingshead on the line, and he can tell you all about it. Director?\"\n \"I\u0027m here,\" the admiral said. \"Chapel-it sounded like you took a pretty good blow to the head, there. Are you recovered?\"\n \"I was dazed for a minute,\" Chapel told him. \"But I\u0027ll be all right. Dr. Taggart took care of me. She also told me a few interesting things about chim-\"\n \"Ahem,\" Hollingshead broke in. \"No need to tell an old dog anything about digging up bones, son.\"\n \"Ah.\" So Hollingshead already knew about chimeras. And what Chapel was facing. It would have been nice to have some warning, but Chapel supposed some things were meant to stay secret. Apparently so secret it couldn\u0027t even be discussed over an encrypted line. \"Okay, then, sir, I\u0027ll tell you all about it some other time. Maybe in person.\"\n \"You\u0027re on the trail, son, and that\u0027s all that matters. What\u0027s the status of your, ah, investigation? What\u0027s your next step?\"\n \"There\u0027s one more name on the list with a New York address. She shouldn\u0027t be in danger now-the other three are probably hundreds of miles from here by now. Still, it won\u0027t hurt to pay her a visit and make sure she\u0027s safe. After that, it\u0027s either Chicago or Atlanta. Any thought on where I should head first?\"\n \"Angel\u0027s looking for clues. Maybe she\u0027ll turn something up. I know you\u0027ll make the right choice, Captain Chapel. I have utter faith in you. Director Banks on the other hand . . .\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"You\u0027ve got some competition, let us say. Oh, nothing you can\u0027t handle-and no one you haven\u0027t met before. Someone you\u0027ve seen around the Pentagon, perhaps.\"\n Laughing Boy. Hollingshead must be talking about Laughing Boy. \"He\u0027s been activated? Maybe that\u0027s good news-two of us running down leads can cover a lot more ground than one,\" Chapel pointed out.\n \"Unfortunately he\u0027s not as proactive as you\u0027ve shown yourself to be,\" Hollingshead said, sounding contrite. \"In fact, I fear he\u0027s simply bird-dogging you. After your recent success, I sent a team to pick up what was left of the . . . fellow in question. Your new shadow got there first. What he did with the remains is currently unknown.\"\n Chapel thought about that. If Laughing Boy had taken the body of the dead detainee, it could simply mean the CIA didn\u0027t want the local authorities claiming the remains of a man who was carrying a dangerous virus. But why not let Hollingshead\u0027s people take care of it? Banks must have had his reasons. Maybe there was something about the body he didn\u0027t want anyone else to see.\n Yet another mystery to add to the already enormous pile of mysteries in this operation. Chapel shrugged it off. \"At least the . . . specimen is under wraps. Do you think I need to worry about our civilian friends?\"\n Hollingshead didn\u0027t sound sure when he answered. \"No one has declared war just yet. Chalk this one up to a shot across our bows, maybe. For now we\u0027re all pulling in the same direction,\" he said. \"Just keep your eyes open.\"\n \"Will do, sir.\"\n \"All right, then. I\u0027ll put Angel back on, and she can help you coordinate your next move.\"\n Chapel talked to Angel briefly, arranging to have a cab waiting when he left the veterinary clinic. Then he opened the door of the examination room and headed out to the front of the office, where Julia and her receptionist were talking quietly. Julia had a balled-up tissue in her hand, and the receptionist was rubbing her back in slow circles. Apparently Julia had finally gotten a chance to start grieving for her mother.\n \"I\u0027ll be going now,\" Chapel told her. \"If there\u0027s anything I can do-\"\n \"You already have,\" Julia told him.\n \"I might have some more questions,\" he suggested. \"But I\u0027ll give you some time, first. I\u0027m . . . I\u0027m so sorry.\"\n She nodded. She wasn\u0027t even looking at him anymore. \"You should get a CT scan at some point. Make sure your brain wasn\u0027t injured in that concussion.\"\n \"If I get a chance, I will,\" he told her.\n \"You\u0027ll want a doctor who specializes in human patients for that.\" She got up to unlock the front door. \"I hope you\u0027ll forgive me if I say I never want our paths to cross again.\"\n He couldn\u0027t blame her for that. \"Thanks for all your help.\"\n She shrugged. He started to walk out the door, but she stopped him by putting one hand on his artificial shoulder. He flinched, even if she didn\u0027t. He\u0027d never gotten used to people touching him there.\n \"Captain,\" she said, \"be careful. But find the rest of them, and make sure nobody else has to go through this. Grief, I mean. It sucks.\"\n \"I\u0027ll do my best,\" he promised her.\n IN TRANSIT: APRIL 12, T+11:29\n Back to work. The next name on the list was Christina Smollett. She was in New York City, too. Hopefully she was still alive.\n A new cab was waiting for him in front of Julia\u0027s clinic. He climbed in, and the car rolled smoothly away before he\u0027d even had a chance to tell the driver what address he wanted.\n \"All taken care of,\" Angel told him.\n \"I appreciate it.\" He tapped on his knee with the fingers of his artificial hand. When he\u0027d been talking with Julia, he\u0027d almost forgotten the time-sensitive nature of his operation. Now that he was away from her, the ticking of the clock started to bother him again. \"We\u0027ll have to make this next visit quick. What can you tell me about Christina Smollett?\"\n Angel hummed a little tune while she worked. \"Interesting,\" she said, after a minute.\n \"Anything you\u0027d like to share?\" Chapel asked.\n Angel laughed. \"If I understood it, I\u0027d give you some analysis. What I\u0027m looking at is just facts. Christina Smollett has a social security number, a date of birth-August 23, 1959-and a mailing address we already knew, 462 First Avenue, New York, where you\u0027re headed now. Beyond that? Not much. As far as I can tell she\u0027s never filed a tax form, for one thing.\"\n \"That\u0027s odd for a woman in her fifties,\" Chapel mused.\n \"Never been married, no children. No family left, either-her parents died a while back, both from natural causes and at advanced ages. No brothers or sisters. She doesn\u0027t have a bank account. She doesn\u0027t have any academic records past high school, which . . . let me check . . . she did graduate from, though not with particularly impressive grades. From there the list gets pretty monotonous. No driver\u0027s license. No history of service in the armed forces. No arrests, warrants for arrest, or so much as a parking ticket. Never been fingerprinted, and I can\u0027t find a single photograph of her taken after 1971. It\u0027s like she hasn\u0027t so much as touched the world in forty years.\"\n \"Sounds like she\u0027s been living off the grid,\" Chapel said.\n \"And you sound like you\u0027ve got a theory, sweetie.\"\n \"More like a hunch,\" Chapel said. \"I\u0027m betting Christina Smollett works for the CIA. Probably in the National Clandestine Service. She\u0027s undercover, or at least off the books.\"\n \"They certainly don\u0027t list her on their payroll,\" Angel confirmed.\n \"Helen Bryant and William Taggart were both CIA employees. I\u0027m pretty sure every single name on that list is or was as well. We\u0027re tracking down the people who worked on some operation in the eighties. Probably something the CIA\u0027s Directorate of Science and Technology got up to.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t they the ones who make the exploding pens and cyanide-filled false teeth?\" Angel asked. \"The gadget shop?\"\n \"They do more than that. They were the ones who ran MK-ULTRA, for instance. That\u0027s exactly the shop that Drs. Bryant and Taggart would work for. And unless I\u0027m way off, I\u0027m willing to bet Christina Smollett worked in the directorate as well.\"\n \"Let me do some more checking, see what I turn up,\" Angel said.\n As the cab rolled into Manhattan the traffic picked up a little, but it wasn\u0027t long before they were on First Avenue. The cabdriver rapped on the partition and glanced over his shoulder. \"You want the emergency room or the main entrance?\" he asked.\n \"What? Emergency room?\" Chapel said. \"No, I\u0027m going to a private residence. A house or an apartment building.\"\n \"Oh, sorry. With that bruise on your head I figured you were checking yourself in. You sure you have the right address?\"\n \"Definitely. 462 First Avenue,\" Chapel confirmed.\n \"Buddy,\" the cabbie told him, \"maybe you should have them take a look at your head. That\u0027s the address for Bellevue Hospital. You know-the place where they send all the crazies.\"\n MANHATTAN, NEW YORK: APRIL 12, T+11:55\n Chapel reached for his wallet to pay the cabdriver, but the man waved his hand to say no. \"All prepaid, and I\u0027m not going to take advantage of a guy like you,\" the cabbie said, smiling broadly.\n \"A guy like me?\" Chapel asked.\n \"No offense, friend, no offense meant. I have a mother in Ohio, she\u0027s like you, okay? So I understand how hard it can be.\"\n Chapel started to reach up to touch his artificial arm, then stopped himself.\n \"When you have trouble keeping track of things, right? When maybe you have memory problems. My mom\u0027s got the Alzheimer\u0027s, she\u0027s doing all right, though.\"\n \"That\u0027s . . . good,\" Chapel said. \"I\u0027m glad to hear it. Thanks.\"\n Clearly the man thought he had brain damage or something. Humiliated and still a little confused by what he was doing there, Chapel climbed out of the cab and looked up at the fa\u0026ccedil;ade of Bellevue Hospital, which looked like any other glass-fronted building in New York except it had the name \"Bellevue\" written up one side. Having only seen the hospital in movies before, he would have expected some huge brick monolith with tiny barred windows from which the occasional scream could be heard.\n Maybe he should check himself in. He was definitely feeling disoriented and confused. Julia had said he was recovering nicely from his concussion, though. \"Angel, do you have any thoughts about what\u0027s going on, here?\"\n \"Just one, sugar. I\u0027m starting to understand why Christina Smollett is so far off the radar. She\u0027s been a resident here since 1979. She\u0027s a patient in the psychiatric hospital.\"\n Chapel frowned. \"How old was she when she checked in? Wait-I can do this one in my head. She was born in 1959 so she would have been nineteen or twenty. I don\u0027t see how she could possibly have done any work for the CIA before that. And I seriously doubt the CIA has any undercover operatives in there.\"\n \"You still want to go in and talk to her?\" Angel asked. \"I can make the arrangements.\"\n \"Yeah, I should at least see if she can give me any new leads.\" Though Chapel wondered what a woman who\u0027d been living in a psychiatric hospital for over thirty years could possibly know about genetic freaks with extra eyelids or the inner workings of secret government facilities. Still, he was here. \"I won\u0027t take long. Can you have a helicopter ready to pick me up when I\u0027m done?\"\n \"There\u0027s a helipad on the roof. It\u0027s not open to civil aviation, but I can get you in and out before anyone knows you\u0027re there. In the meantime . . . okay, you\u0027re good. You\u0027ve been added to the list of approved visitors for Christina Smollett. I\u0027ve listed you as being in law enforcement.\"\n \"Thanks,\" Chapel said, and he hurried for the entrance. There was a metal detector inside and a couple of bored-looking uniformed security guards, one of whom was reading a newspaper. The other wrote down Chapel\u0027s name on a clipboard and then waved him through to a bank of elevators.\n On the way up Angel gave him directions to the correct ward. The Psychiatric Hospital was behind a series of locked doors that security guards had to open for him. The place was clean and brightly lit, but it looked old and tired all the same, the walls painted in drab institutional colors and the endless doors all the same. Following Angel\u0027s directions, he finally reached a nurses\u0027 station where a man in purple surgical scrubs waved him over. \"You\u0027re here to see Kristin, right?\"\n \"Christina Smollett,\" Chapel said, glad as always that he had Angel to smooth the way for him. Without her it might have taken hours to get this far.\n \"Christina? We have a Kristin Smollett,\" the nurse told him. \"Huh. Ruth? Ruth!\"\n An older woman in a starched white uniform came to the window of the nurses\u0027 station and peered out with sharp eyes.\n \"Ruth,\" the male nurse asked, \"Christina Smollett. Is that the same as Kristin?\"\n \"Yes,\" Ruth told him, handing him a manila folder. \"She\u0027ll be in her room this time of day. Dinner\u0027s in an hour; be sure to be done with your visit by then, sir.\"\n \"It shouldn\u0027t take that long,\" Chapel assured her.\n The male nurse led him down a long corridor. He leafed through the folder while they walked. It looked like it was Christina Smollett\u0027s medical record.\n \"Funny,\" the nurse said. \"I\u0027ve been working here six years. I always thought her name was Kristin.\"\n \"She never corrected you?\" Chapel asked.\n \"You haven\u0027t visited her before, have you?\" the nurse inquired. He caught Chapel trying to read over his shoulder, and he snapped the manila folder closed.\n \"No,\" Chapel admitted.\n The nurse gave him a shrewd look, but then he shrugged. \"Somebody like Kristin, somebody who\u0027s been taking antipsychotic medication for a long time, it kind of . . . eats away at them. It keeps them from acting out, and it makes the disturbed thoughts go away. But it doesn\u0027t leave a whole lot else in there.\" He lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Looking at her medication history, it\u0027s like reading a book on the history of nasty pills. The stuff we give here now is okay, it\u0027s all new wonder drugs. But back in the eighties she was mainlining Thorazine, and that stuff turns you into a zombie. I\u0027d be pretty surprised if she can even remember her name.\"\n MANHATTAN, NEW YORK: APRIL 12, T+12:07\n The nurse unlocked a door and gestured for Chapel to head into the room beyond. \"I\u0027ll be out here when you\u0027re done, so I can check you back out.\"\n Chapel thanked him and stepped inside.\n The room was small but not cramped, pleasant without exactly being comfortable. There was a bed and a dresser inside, and one window that looked like it couldn\u0027t be opened. Christina Smollett was sitting on the bed. She might have been fifty or seventy. Her hair was long and gray, and it looked like it had been carefully brushed on one side and left tangled and knotted on the other. She wore a sweat suit, and she was staring at the one piece of ornamentation in the entire room, a picture taped to the wall. The picture was of Tom Selleck, a twinkle in his eye and a cocky grin half hidden behind his famous mustache.\n She didn\u0027t move at all when Chapel came in. She didn\u0027t seem aware of his presence. He walked over in front of her, not wanting to block her view of the picture but needing to get her attention. \"Ms. Smollett?\" he asked. \"Christina?\"\n She blinked when he said her name, but didn\u0027t move her head. Her lips were curled in a simple smile. \"He always looks so nice, in his shows,\" she said. \"Like he would be friendly if you met him.\"\n She sighed happily.\n Chapel took a deep breath. \"Christina, my name is Chapel. I need to ask you some questions. I need to know if you\u0027ve ever met a Dr. Helen Bryant or a Dr. William Taggart.\"\n She stuck out her lower lip and shook her head in the negative. \"I know lots of doctors, though, and they don\u0027t always tell me their names. I\u0027ve known a whole bunch of doctors. Doctors like me. They say I\u0027m a perfect patient.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure you are,\" Chapel told her. \"How about Franklin Hayes? He\u0027s a judge. Have you ever met a judge?\"\n \"Oh, no. There would have been a judge at my commitment hearing. But they didn\u0027t take me to that. Mommy said they didn\u0027t want to upset me. I used to be very easy to upset.\" She looked back at the picture on the wall. \"Do you think he would be nice, if you met him in person?\"\n \"Tom Selleck?\"\n \"Is that his name? I . . . I have trouble with names sometimes. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m being a terrible hostess. Can I offer you a cup of coffee? If you\u0027re hungry, I could probably make something.\"\n Chapel glanced around the room by reflex, but of course there was no coffeemaker in the room, much less any kind of kitchen facilities.\n This was going nowhere. Christina Smollett\u0027s mind was mush, to be callous about it. She wasn\u0027t there. He took the kill list from his pocket and ran down the rest of the names, but she just shook her head at the sound of each one.\n What on earth did this woman have to do with chimeras and kill lists and CIA secret projects? He couldn\u0027t see any connection at all. More to the point, why would the detainees-the chimeras, as he was coming to think of them-want to kill this woman in the first place? She was no danger to them or anybody else.\n If she had ever known a secret, a secret that could damage national security, it was long gone.\n \"You\u0027re very handsome,\" she said, and looked down at her hands. A blush spread across her cheeks. \"I don\u0027t see a lot of white people in here. Most of the nurses are Spanish or Negroes.\"\n \" . . . okay,\" Chapel said. \"Christina, it was nice meeting you, but I think I should go now. Be . . . well.\" He couldn\u0027t think of anything else to say, and for once Angel was no help. \"Be safe.\"\n \"You look nice. Nice and handsome. That\u0027s a very good combination in a gentleman caller. I don\u0027t get as many gentleman callers as I did when I was younger,\" she told him. \"Will you come again, Mr. Selleck? Please tell me you\u0027ll come and see me again sometime. I\u0027d like that very much.\"\n Chapel stood up and walked over to the door. \"Perhaps, Christina. I\u0027m, uh, very busy with work right now, and-\"\n \"You know what they say, a young lady with no social connections is at high risk of recidivism.\" It sounded like something a doctor might have said to her once. \"I could backslide. I could lose all the wonderful progress I\u0027ve made if I don\u0027t get to see people sometimes. If I don\u0027t get to talk to people, get social stimulation, if I-\"\n She stopped talking then.\n Her face went white and her eyes very wide.\n Chapel looked down and saw she had grabbed his arm. His left arm. Her fingers squeezed at the silicone that was wrapped around the motors there.\n She grabbed the fingers of his artificial hand and brought them up to her face to look at them more closely. And then she started to scream. Piercing, hysterical cries of utter terror.\n \"You\u0027re not real! You\u0027re a robot! You\u0027re a robot!\"\n Chapel pressed up against the wall to one side of the door as Christina ran around the room, grabbing the blankets off her bed, tearing the picture of Tom Selleck off the wall. She held them close to her like armor, like they could protect her.\n \"He\u0027s a robot,\" she shrieked as the nurse came into the room. \"He\u0027s not real! Don\u0027t let him touch me. Don\u0027t let him put that thing inside me! Don\u0027t let him touch me!\"\n The nurse stared at Chapel as he took Christina\u0027s shoulders and tried to calm her down.\n \"I have an artificial arm,\" Chapel tried to explain. \"A prosthetic. She grabbed it and-and-\"\n \"Just go. Get out-Ruth can check you out,\" the nurse said. He turned to Christina and tried to shush her, his hands stroking her arms.\n \"You\u0027re not real! You\u0027re a machine man!\" she shouted.\n Chapel hurried out into the hall and down toward the nurses\u0027 station, glancing over his shoulder to make sure Christina wasn\u0027t running after him. At the station the nurse named Ruth leaned out through her window. She looked at him, then down the hall toward Christina\u0027s room.\n \"I, uh,\" Chapel said. \"I seem to have-\"\n \"This is a psychiatric hospital, sir,\" Ruth told him. \"It happens. It\u0027s best if you just leave now.\"\n \"Not a problem,\" Chapel said. He signed the form she put in front of him and headed for the locked doors that led off the ward.\n BROOKLYN, NEW YORK: APRIL 12, T+12:16\n Julia\u0027s receptionist was taking advantage of this very weird day to catch up on her filing. Portia Artiz loved her job, but she didn\u0027t know what to make of any of the things that had happened so far. The morning had been perfectly normal, a parade of dogs and cats coming through the front room, phone calls and forms to be filled out. Then Julia had said she was going to her mom\u0027s place for lunch and everything had just gone weird.\n First Julia had called to tell Portia to cancel all her appointments, but she wouldn\u0027t explain why. She\u0027d been crying on the phone and Portia begged her to say why, but Julia had a way of not letting anybody in. Portia blamed that on her mother, who everybody said was such a saint but the couple of times Portia met her she\u0027d been a real frosty bitch.\n Oh, man, she shouldn\u0027t even think things like that. Julia\u0027s mom was dead, attacked by some weirdo looking for drugs. The very thought made Portia\u0027s skin crawl. They got junkies in the office all the time, looking to score from the supply of animal tranquilizers they kept in a closet at the back of the office. Most of them were scrawny little guys, no threat to anybody but themselves. They were more annoying than dangerous-they came up with the craziest stories about why their pets needed the drugs really bad, right away, and they just didn\u0027t give up. Half of Portia\u0027s job was getting rid of them, threatening to call the police if they didn\u0027t leave. What if one of those guys was as jacked up and dangerous as the one who got Julia\u0027s mom, though? Portia shivered as she bent over the filing cabinet.\n Someone rapped on the glass door behind her, and Portia jumped right into the air. She gave out a little squeak and turned to see a man standing at the door, a big guy with a smile on his face. Probably another junkie, she thought, until he held up a police badge and pressed it against the glass.\n He started laughing and Portia realized she must look hilarious, jumping straight in the air like that. He chuckled wildly and she couldn\u0027t help herself, she had to join in. She giggled behind her hand and shook her head as she opened the door. \"You scared me half to death,\" she said, still laughing. \"What can I do for you? If this is about that guy who came back here earlier, the one with the concussion-\" she started.\n \"Nope,\" the man said, and then he grabbed her by the throat and squeezed, hard. Portia\u0027s vision started to dim as she struggled for breath. \"Not him. I\u0027m here for your boss.\"\n MANHATTAN, NEW YORK: APRIL 12, T+12:17\n While Chapel waited on the roof of Bellevue for his helicopter he spoke to Angel, trying to figure out why someone like Christina Smollett would be a target for the chimeras.\n \"She\u0027s definitely not CIA,\" Angel said.\n \"Definitely. But then why is she on the list?\" He crumpled the list in his hand. \"Maybe this is all a snipe hunt. Maybe the list is meant to send me down the wrong path. Maybe I\u0027m wasting my time chasing phantoms just so the CIA can have a good laugh at my expense, and-\"\n \"No. The list is real. The names are all there for a reason,\" Angel said, and any trace of flirtation or sultriness was gone from her voice. \"Every one of those people is marked for death, including Christina Smollett.\"\n Chapel looked up at the sky as if he would see Angel floating there.\n Interesting.\n Very interesting.\n \"You know things you aren\u0027t telling me,\" he said.\n \"Now, sugar,\" she said, her voice softening again. \"You already knew that. Don\u0027t be silly, there are all kinds of secrets that I can\u0027t-\"\n \"In fact, you knew all about Christina Smollett before I came here on this fool\u0027s errand,\" he said, very carefully.\n \"How could I know that?\"\n \"Because you called here, back when I asked you to let the targets know they were in danger. You knew she was a patient in Bellevue, you must have-because you talked to somebody here. Her doctors, the security guards-somebody.\"\n \"I . . . spoke to them. Yes.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t mention that before I got here. You let it be a little surprise for me. We\u0027re not exactly on the same team, are we, Angel?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m trying to save lives here. I\u0027m trying to stop a bunch of killers. And you\u0027re not on board for that. Not fully. You have another agenda you\u0027re working here, and it\u0027s not about keeping these people alive.\"\n He waited for her reply. For her to try to smooth things over, to explain things away. But she didn\u0027t say anything. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chimera-a-jim-chapel-mission-jim-chapel-1/page-8.html","bookId":1585,"book":{"id":1585,"title":"Chimera: A Jim Chapel Mission (Jim Chapel #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Chimera: A Jim Chapel Mission (Jim Chapel #1) \n Wounded Special Forces veteran Jim Chapel has been stuck behind a desk rather than out in the field, but medical technology has finally caught up with his ambitions.
