{"id":111098,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"Why is that relevant?\" Chapel asked. \"Because the name of the girl was Christina Smollett.\" IN TRANSIT: APRIL 12, T+16:23 \"Holy shit,\" Chapel said. He wasn\u0027t a big fan of pointless vulgarity, but this situation seemed to warrant it. \"That\u0027s no coincidence.\" \"Definitely not,\" Angel said. \"I\u0027ll forgive you for sullying my ears with such language,\" she went on. \"Because right now I feel like fucking swearing myself. I have no way of knowing what the connection actually amounts to. I\u0027m being honest with you here, Chapel. I don\u0027t have any information on what the CIA might have actually done to Christina Smollett. But there has to be some relevance. The CIA did something to her, and she associated it in some way with being sexually assaulted.\" \"And Franklin Hayes smoothed it over,\" Chapel said. \"Covered it up.\" \"Worse than that. He tried to countersue the family for besmirching the name of the CIA,\" Angel went on. \"The judge dismissed the countersuit but agreed to seal all testimony heard in the case. The whole thing was spun as some crazy girl making impossible accusations, and the CIA just didn\u0027t want the public to make something out of nothing. But if there wasn\u0027t something there, we wouldn\u0027t be talking about it right now.\" \"I\u0027m not a big fan of the CIA right now,\" Chapel said, which was putting it mildly. \"But even I don\u0027t believe they\u0027re in the business of raping schizophrenics.\" The words felt ugly in his mouth, but that was what they were talking about. He sighed. \"If the records are sealed, I guess there\u0027s no way for you to find out what the testimony said.\" \"This was back in the late eighties, before anything was digitized,\" Angel told him. \"Assuming it wasn\u0027t actually destroyed, all that testimony is locked away in a filing cabinet somewhere. Short of breaking into a courthouse and stealing the physical papers, no one is ever going to see it-and that\u0027s more your area than mine.\" \"I\u0027m no thief,\" Chapel told her. \"I\u0027m not about to do that. So we\u0027ll have to find some other way of getting the information. Someone has to know what happened. Franklin Hayes, for instance. I bet he knows all about it.\" \"Too bad you just turned him into an enemy,\" Angel pointed out. \"Did you hear our conversation?\" \"All of it. In fact, so did Director Hollingshead. I woke him up and let him listen in. He\u0027s very interested in what Banks did to my computers. And so am I. Chapel, I need to get started on sweeping my gear and moving to new servers. We can\u0027t let them just eavesdrop whenever they want. In fact, if they know what we\u0027ve just been talking about . . . well. They\u0027re not going to like the fact we made this connection.\" \"True enough. All right, Angel. Do what you need to do. We\u0027re still a ways from Atlanta, and after we land, I\u0027ll be doing some legwork anyway. I\u0027ll need to check in with-\" \"Chapel, until we\u0027re secure again, it\u0027s better if I don\u0027t know the details.\" \"Got it. Thank you, Angel. Thanks for everything.\" She didn\u0027t respond. The hands-free unit in his ear had already switched off. ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 12, T+17:53 The jet set down at Hartsfield-Jackson airport in the middle of the night. Chief Petty Officer Andrews brought them cups of hot coffee and croissants while they taxied to the gate and waited for clearance to debark. Chapel had to admit that if he had to fly, this was the way to go. Hollingshead was a lucky man. Before he knew it, he and Julia were whisked through the terminal and out to where a car was waiting for them. The driver seemed surprised when they said they had no luggage. \"Not even an overnight bag?\" he asked. Chapel just shrugged. Fatigue was starting to get to him. He needed to sleep, but that wasn\u0027t in the cards. He gave the driver Jeremy Funt\u0027s last known address. \"Seriously? That\u0027s down in Capitol View. Not the best neighborhood,\" the driver told him. \"It\u0027s where we\u0027re going,\" Chapel said. \"You\u0027re the boss.\" The driver got the car moving and thankfully had little to say after that. Chapel tried watching through the windows as they rolled along, trying to get a feel for this new city. It all blurred together into lights and pools of darkness. He focused on the street signs instead. After about twenty minutes he leaned forward, a little alarmed. \"You\u0027re driving in circles,\" he told the driver. Had Banks set him up? Was this some kind of ploy to delay him? Or was there something more sinister going on? Was he going to be taken somewhere quiet and quietly shot? He started to reach for his weapon. \"What are you talking about? I know this city like the back of my hand,\" the driver said. \"We just passed Peachtree Street,\" Chapel said. \"Except we passed Peachtree Street ten minutes ago.\" The driver laughed. \"Buddy, you never been to Atlanta before, have you? Half the streets here are called that. It\u0027s the state tree. You never heard of Georgia peaches?\" \"Oh,\" Chapel said. He sank back into his seat. Damn it, he was getting paranoid. Which only made sense given his circumstances, but still-he was losing it. He\u0027d been going too long too fast, never getting a chance to rest. He needed sleep. If he didn\u0027t get it, he would probably start shooting at shadows. He told himself he just needed to find Jeremy Funt. Once he had the man located and under protection, he could rest. Just a little while longer. Within thirty seconds his head fell back against the seat and he was asleep. ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+19:01 \"Hey. Hey, buddy! We\u0027re here!\" Chapel\u0027s eyes snapped open. They felt gritty and raw. All of him felt gritty and raw. Where was he? What was . . . Right. It all came flooding back. He stirred himself, sat up. Adjusted his jacket. He touched Julia\u0027s shoulder, and she slapped his hand away. \"Take your time,\" the driver told him. Chapel nodded and rubbed at his face with his hands. His silicone left hand dragged in his stubble, but the irritation helped wake him up a little. He rubbed Julia\u0027s shoulder with his good hand. \"It\u0027s time to wake up,\" he told her. She shifted in her seat, making little sounds of annoyance. Then she leaned forward and laid her head on his chest, one of her arms snaking around his waist. \"Let me sleep in today,\" she said. \"The little Chihuahuas can wait.\" She was so warm against his body in the chilly air-conditioned cab. Chapel felt his body stirring. He put his good hand on her hair and stroked it gently. Whoa, he told himself. Not appropriate. He thought of when she\u0027d been examining him in her clinic, and she\u0027d kissed him. That had just been a reward for saving her, though. Except-she had said that it was also maybe because she\u0027d wanted to kiss him. Her hair was soft and slightly curly. It felt good in his fingers. This was totally wrong, he thought. He had a mission to complete; there was no time for this. But he wanted so desperately to just lean in and kiss her awake. \"Oh, no,\" she said, and sat bolt upright. \"Oh my God.\" \"It\u0027s not what-\" \"Oh my God,\" she said again. \"Oh God. Chapel. I-I am so sorry.\" \"You are?\" he asked. \"I thought you were somebody else. My ex-boyfriend. Wow,\" she said. \"That was not appropriate, huh? I\u0027m really sorry.\" Chapel reached for the handle of his door. \"It\u0027s fine. Really,\" he said. He opened his door and stepped out onto the sidewalk. Harsh sodium lamps burned down from above, pushing away shadows that refused to be completely contained. The buildings on either side of him were mostly one- and two-story houses with peaked roofs. Each had a patch of green lawn out front, and most had a tree or two. It looked nothing whatsoever like New York City. \"Do we need to pay the driver?\" Julia asked, coming up beside him. \"No-no-it\u0027s all taken care of,\" he said, a little too quickly. She gave him a weak smile. He turned toward the car, intending to ask the driver to wait while they went inside, but the cabbie was already pulling away. He waved furiously to call the man back, but it was no use. Oh, well. He could always call for another car. Even without Angel\u0027s help he supposed he could manage that. \"So what\u0027s the plan, here?\" Julia asked. \"The man who lives here, Jeremy Funt, is like your father-at least in that the chimeras want to kill them both.\" She winced and he immediately felt like an ass. She knew her father\u0027s life-just as her own-was in danger, and she didn\u0027t need to be reminded of the fact. \"I\u0027m going to get him, and you, out of here. And then I\u0027m going to sit here all night waiting for a chimera to show up. If I can, I\u0027ll take it into custody.\" \"How do you know the chimera will come here?\" she asked, rubbing at her eyes. \"I don\u0027t, really. But I\u0027m operating under the assumption the chimera has the same list I do, which is how I got this address. Huh. No lights on in the house.\" Julia shrugged. \"It\u0027s late. Maybe he\u0027s asleep, like a sane person.\" \"Maybe,\" Chapel agreed. If it was him, if he knew a psychopath was coming to kill him, Chapel would keep a light on. It would at least make it easier to see the maniac when he arrived. \"Come on.\" He went up a narrow gravel driveway to the front door of the house and knocked loudly. He glanced around at the surrounding houses. Plenty of them still showed lights. He could see the blue glow of a television set through one window across the street and hear people laughing somewhere nearby. A dog was barking a few streets away. It wasn\u0027t that late. When there was no answer to his knock he looked around until he found a doorbell and tried that. Still no response. \"Maybe he was really sane, and he went somewhere else. Since he knew the chimera was coming. You did let everyone know they were in danger, right?\" Julia asked. \"It was the first thing I did.\" Something here just wasn\u0027t right. He knocked again, knowing there would be no reply. \"Okay. I need to get inside, whether he\u0027s here or not, so I can lay my ambush for the chimera. Stand back and watch the street. If you see anyone looking at us and wondering what we\u0027re doing, let me know. If you see a police car, let me know.\" \"I\u0027m guessing, in this neighborhood that\u0027s a pretty rare sight,\" Julia told him. \"Keep an eye out anyway.\" Chapel flexed his shoulder. It had been a long time since he had knocked a door down with brute force. He had little choice, though. He grabbed the doorknob, intending to lift the door in its hinges and then ram it with his shoulder. Except the knob turned freely in his hand. The door swung open. It wasn\u0027t locked. Something here was definitely not right. ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+19:12 Chapel drew his weapon and stepped inside the dark house. He motioned for Julia to follow him, then pulled the door shut behind him. \"Look for a light switch,\" he told Julia. Then he turned to face the darkness and called out, \"Mr. Funt? I\u0027m a federal agent. I\u0027m here to protect you.\" He didn\u0027t expect a response, and he didn\u0027t get one. Behind him he heard a click, and then the lights came on. The house was tastefully, if plainly, furnished. The front door opened on a living room with a large television set, a comfortable-looking sofa, and a beaten-up coffee table that might have been an antique, once. Bookshelves lined the far wall, but they were half empty. Two archways led off the main room, one to what looked like a kitchen-he could see a refrigerator and a stove through the arch-and one to what presumably was a bedroom. A curtain of beads hung down from that arch. Chapel pointed his weapon toward each arch and called out Funt\u0027s name again. It was possible this was a colossal waste of time. Maybe no chimera had come to Atlanta at all. Maybe all three of them were in Chicago already and were beating Eleanor Pechowski to death while he stood here, wondering what to do next. That kind of thinking didn\u0027t help at all. \"Stay close to me,\" he told Julia, but she was already walking over to the coffee table. \"Does this guy look like a slob to you?\" she asked. Chapel wondered what she was getting at, but he glanced around the room. There were coasters on the coffee table, and no empty cans or glasses lying around. \"Not at all,\" he said. \"The opposite, in fact.\" Julia ran one index finger along the top of the coffee table. She held it up where he could see it-it was covered in dust. \"He hasn\u0027t been here in a while.\" Chapel frowned. That had to mean something important, but-what? Even if Funt had vacated the house as soon as he got the call from Angel, that was still less than twenty-four hours ago. Dust didn\u0027t accumulate that quickly. \"You have a list of addresses for the people the chimeras want to kill,\" Julia said. When he started to protest, she held up both hands. \"I\u0027m not asking any questions, don\u0027t worry. You can keep your secrets. I just wanted to point out that maybe your list isn\u0027t up to date. Funt might have moved out of here a while ago.\" \"Maybe,\" Chapel agreed. \"I\u0027m going to check the kitchen. Stay here.\" Julia looked annoyed at being ordered around, but there wasn\u0027t much he could do about that. He didn\u0027t have time to ask her permission every time he needed her to do something. Civilians were fine in principle, he thought, until you needed them to follow orders. He went into the kitchen and found another light switch. The kitchen was as Spartan as the living room, with a small table pushed up against one wall and only one chair. There was thick dust on the table, but when he checked the stove and the countertops they were clean. No dust on them at all. Funt might have moved out weeks ago-but he had come back at least once. \"I\u0027m going to check the bedroom,\" Julia called. \"No! Wait for me,\" he shouted back, but he knew she wouldn\u0027t listen. He turned to leave the kitchen when he caught another look at the table-and the dust on top of it. Someone had written a message in it, presumably using his finger. Chapel bent low to get a look at it in better light. IF YOU WANT TO FIND ME I\u0027VE GONE UNDER THE UNDERGROUND \"Oh shit!\" Julia called. Chapel ignored the message in the dust and raced back into the living room. He saw Julia standing in the beaded curtain, holding it back with one hand. \"I think we\u0027re too late,\" she said. \"I think he\u0027s dead.\" ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+19:46 Chapel raced over to her side. He put an arm out to stop her from going any farther, then peered into the darkened bedroom. Like the rest of the house it was only semifurnished. There was a single bed up against the far wall, and a dresser standing next to the window. The sheets of the bed had been pulled up over a human-sized form. It looked very much like someone had died in their sleep and had the sheets drawn over his face. Chapel noticed a strange, acrid smell in the air. At first he thought it had to be the stench of decay, that the body had been left there long enough for it to start rotting. But he knew the smell of death, and this wasn\u0027t it. This smelled more like benzene or maybe diesel fuel. \"Just like my mom,\" Julia breathed. She sounded like she was close to going into shock-or maybe like she would start screaming. Chapel stepped toward the bed, intending to throw the sheet back and see if it was really Funt lying there. Something about the position of the body seemed wrong. The body had been lain out carefully, its legs together and its arms at its sides. The way bodies looked when they were lain in their coffins. The chimera he\u0027d fought in New York wouldn\u0027t have bothered to do something like that. He\u0027d made no attempt to pose Helen Bryant-he\u0027d just killed her and then left her in a heap. That smell. It was very strong over by the bed. Chapel reached down and touched the sheet near the body\u0027s head. He grasped the edge of the sheet and started to pull it down. Behind him he heard a click as Julia switched on the bedroom light. Two things occurred to him in that moment. One was that the form under the sheet was too lumpy. Up close it didn\u0027t look so much like a human being anymore. The other thing was that he distinctly heard some kind of fizzing sound. It had started the same moment Julia switched on the lights. He yanked the sheet back and saw what was really there. Red plastic canisters, the kind used to store gasoline. Or diesel fuel. There were eight of them in the bed, grouped together to resemble a human body. They had yellow plastic screw lids. Chapel unscrewed one and the smell nearly overpowered him. It wasn\u0027t just diesel fuel in there-the diesel had been mixed with fertilizer. He was looking at a homemade bomb. That fizzing sound . . . It had to be the noise of a burning fuse, which was lit when Julia flipped the light switch. \"Get out! Front door! Now!\" Chapel shouted, turning around and pushing Julia ahead of him, through the beaded curtain. He caught her wrong and she nearly went sprawling, nearly fell right onto the coffee table. Chapel grabbed her around the waist with his artificial arm and bull rushed the front door, slamming up against it because he\u0027d forgotten it opened inward. Behind him he heard a fwoosh as the fuse burned down and set the first canister alight. The bedroom window exploded outward in a gout of flame and smoke, glass and wood bursting outward in a cone that shredded the hedges and set fire to a tree ten feet away. A billowing wave of smoke came rushing out the front door, and with it a shock wave that smashed Chapel\u0027s face to the side as pieces of burning and broken furniture stormed past him. He slammed his eyes shut to protect them even as the heat hit him, making him feel like he was being roasted alive. In a moment it was over except for the smoke and the car alarms and the ringing in his ears. He looked down and saw he was lying on top of Julia, his artificial arm wrapped around her head, presumably to protect her from the blast. \"Are you okay?\" he asked her. She nodded. Her eyes were very wide. Clearly no one had ever tried to blow her up before. Chapel wished he could say the same. He looked up and saw every light on the street was on now, every house awake and alert. People had come out onto their porches to see what was going on. Some of them were standing in the street, watching Funt\u0027s house as it went up in flames. He looked down and saw he was still lying on Julia. He released her head from his cradling arm, and she pulled herself out from beneath him. Carefully he got to his feet, then helped her up as well. \"I get the feeling Jeremy Funt was expecting us,\" Julia said. Chapel shook his head. He felt a little dizzy from the blast, still. If you want to find me I\u0027ve gone under the underground. . . Who the hell was this guy, and what game was he playing? LANGLEY, VIRGINIA: APRIL 13, T+21:02 Policemen in fireproof suits climbed over the remains of the charred house like ants on a discarded candy bar. Fire engines were parked three deep in front, their engines idling noisily while water leaked from their hose connectors. Up and down the street the locals were leaning off their porches, trying to get a better look. Tom Banks watched it all on a fifty-inch screen. The image was grainy, especially blown up that big. It was coming through the lens of a cameraphone and the resolution just couldn\u0027t keep up. Every time Laughing Boy moved, the view distorted and broke down into pixels as big as Banks\u0027s thumb. \"Fertilizer bomb,\" Laughing Boy confirmed. He\u0027d been on the scene just minutes after the explosion and he\u0027d been liaising with the local cops the whole time. \"You know what that looks like. Heh. Domestic terrorism.\" \"I thought you took your medication,\" Banks said, annoyed as always by his underling\u0027s constant giggling. \"Oh, I did,\" the operative confirmed. \"Just thought that was funny.\" Banks poured himself a scotch and soda. It looked like he would be up all night. \"I don\u0027t suppose we got lucky and they pulled any bodies out of there? Say, a one-armed gimp and a redhead with a nice ass?\" \"They made it out. Cops are looking for \u0027em right now,\" Laughing Boy replied. \"Jeremy Funt, too. They want to know why he would blow up his own house.\" \"Figures. Hollingshead will make that heat go away,\" Banks said. He sighed deeply. \"You want me to help the cops out? Or maybe make this problem go away by myself?\" Laughing Boy asked. \"Not yet,\" Banks told him. \"There\u0027ll be time for that after Chapel leads us to Funt. The chimera might do it for us, too. Chapel\u0027s gotten lucky so far, but luck runs out.\" \"And if it doesn\u0027t-\" Banks frowned. \"When I give the word, you can kill Chapel. Not before.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Laughing Boy said. ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+24:43 Orange light touched Chapel\u0027s eyes. He opened them and looked around, uncertain for a moment where he was. He was lying in a bed, covered by a thick blanket. He was wearing nothing but his pants. Motel room, he thought. That was right. He and Julia had checked in last night. He had said he would lie down for a little while, expecting his racing thoughts to keep him awake. Then . . . His mouth tasted awful. Slowly he sat up and looked around. He heard water running, and decided that Julia must be taking a shower in the bathroom. Her clothes were draped over the back of a chair. His were folded neatly on top of a dresser. He must have been so tired he just passed out. He couldn\u0027t remember undressing. He reached up with both hands to rub at his face. His right hand touched his cheek. He felt his left hand moving, but it never made contact. He tried to lift it to his face again, and it felt like it went right through him. He had the unnerving sensation that it was passing right through his flesh. With a start he looked down and saw that his arm was gone. Chapel was no stranger to the phantom limb effect. Before he\u0027d been fitted with his prosthesis, he\u0027d constantly felt like his arm was still there and he just couldn\u0027t see it. He\u0027d been able, in his mind, to move his left hand, to make a fist. For the first few months after the amputation, he\u0027d experienced severe pain in that hand. That was normal, they told him. The body\u0027s image of itself wasn\u0027t based on present reality but on muscle memory, and his brain was just having trouble remembering that part of his body was missing. He often woke up in the morning thinking his arm was still there. Each day brought a fresh shock when he recalled what he had become. He had a brief moment of panic until he saw the arm, sitting on a coffee table near the room\u0027s door. It was plugged in and charging. So were his and Julia\u0027s phones, and his hands-free set. He didn\u0027t remember doing any of that. He didn\u0027t remember taking off his arm. He couldn\u0027t imagine doing it in front of Julia. And yet here he was.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chimera-a-jim-chapel-mission-jim-chapel-1/page-11.html","bookId":1585,"book":{"id":1585,"title":"Chimera: A Jim Chapel Mission (Jim Chapel #1)","description":"Storyline: Chimera: A Jim Chapel Mission (Jim Chapel #1) Wounded Special Forces veteran Jim Chapel has been stuck behind a desk rather than out in the field, but medical technology has finally caught up with his ambitions.
