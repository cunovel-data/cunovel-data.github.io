He was duty bound not to reveal any of the limited information he had about the chimeras.\n But she had a right to know.\n He took the hands-free unit from his ear and buried it inside his jacket, along with his phone. Then he turned on the cold water tap in the bathroom. He didn\u0027t want Angel to hear him talking about this. Not if he was going to be blunt about it. \"The chimeras I\u0027m chasing are escapees from a facility in the Catskills,\" he told Julia, when he was sure he\u0027d taken enough precautions. \"They were held there a long time. Maybe all their lives. They were locked up not just because they\u0027re so obviously dangerous, but because they are carriers for some kind of virus.\"\n \"Like Typhoid Mary,\" Julia suggested.\n \"Who?\" Chapel asked.\n Julia shook her head in disbelief. \"You\u0027ve never heard of her? She was a woman who lived in New York a hundred years ago. She was a carrier for typhoid fever-she never actually got the disease herself, but she worked as a cook for a number of families and everywhere she worked she ended up giving the disease to whoever ate her food. She refused to believe that she had the disease, since she didn\u0027t show any symptoms.\"\n \"What happened to her?\" Chapel asked.\n \"Eventually she had to be quarantined. She spent the rest of her life-thirty years-on an island in the East River, all alone.\"\n Thirty years, Chapel thought. If Julia was locked up somewhere like that, she might live another fifty years. How long would the chimeras have lived if nobody let them out of their cage?\n \"This virus the chimeras are carrying-\" Julia began.\n \"It\u0027s why I\u0027m so desperate to catch them. It\u0027s why this is so important that some people are willing to kill over it.\"\n \"Yes. I grasped that part already,\" Julia said. She sat up very straight on the end of the bed, her hands folded in her lap. \"Is it airborne?\"\n \"No. It can only be passed on through exchange of body fluids.\"\n \"That\u0027s not as comforting as it sounds,\" she said, and the look on her face must have been the one while explaining to her clients how distemper or kennel cough worked. \"Diseases vary in how difficult they are to pass on-HIV, for instance, is actually very difficult to transmit, that\u0027s why it mostly spreads through sex and blood transfusions. Other bloodborne illnesses are much more robust. For some of them a chimera could sneeze on someone, or spit on them, and transmit it. What disease are we talking about? Some kind of flu? A retrovirus? Ebola?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s classified.\"\n Julia frowned. \"Classified. They didn\u0027t even tell you that much?\"\n \"Just that it\u0027s hard to detect, and that there is no cure or vaccine.\"\n \"Fuck,\" Julia said.\n \"But you don\u0027t have it,\" Chapel told her.\n \"I don\u0027t? How do you know that? You haven\u0027t taken any blood or tissue samples that I\u0027m aware of. Maybe while I was sleeping, but I imagine I would have noticed that.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t do that to you without your knowledge.\"\n She sighed. \"Then how can you possibly know I\u0027m not infected, Chapel?\"\n \"I just do. Your contact with the chimera was minimal. He didn\u0027t bite or scratch you when you were in that cab, and-\"\n \"He manhandled me. Something could have happened. Why did you keep this from me? I thought Laughing Boy was just a homicidal lunatic. There seemed to be a lot of that going around! I had no idea this was a public health issue. Chapel-what if I kissed Rudy, like he wanted? I could have given it to him. Shit-I did kiss you, and more.\"\n \"I had contact with the chimera as well. And I know I don\u0027t have it,\" Chapel told her.\n \"Good God, Chapel! Either of us could have given it to the other. Oh, God-why didn\u0027t I wait at least until we had some condoms? I was so caught up in the moment. I didn\u0027t even think about STDs, much less this! Chapel, what if I had it, and you didn\u0027t, but I gave it to you this morning? Huh? What if it was the other way around? What if you gave it to me when you made love to me?\"\n Chapel\u0027s mouth fell open. That was-that was a horrible thought. That was beyond thinking about. \"But we don\u0027t have it,\" he insisted.\n \"How can you know that for sure?\"\n \"Because I would feel it. I would know somehow!\"\n She stared at him. \"You do know I have some medical training, right? I mean, I\u0027ve patched you up a couple of times now. They call me Doctor Taggart. I went to school for this. I know exactly how easy these things spread. I\u0027m going to go out on a limb here. The chimeras didn\u0027t just pick this up naturally, did they?\"\n \"No. The virus is human engineered,\" Chapel confirmed.\n \"You mean weaponized,\" she said.\n The word hung in the air like the first drops of rain before a hurricane hits.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Chapel said. \"It\u0027s-\"\n \"Classified. Which might as well be a yes.\" Julia got up and walked into the bathroom. She started washing her hands vigorously. It looked like a reflexive action, something she\u0027d learned to do whenever people started talking about viruses around her.\n He had forgotten she was a doctor. He\u0027d forgotten she probably knew a lot more about viruses than he did. He should have been honest with her.\n When she came back to the door of the bathroom and looked out at him, her eyes were haunted. \"I need to be quarantined,\" she said.\n \"No,\" Chapel told her. \"No, we can\u0027t-\"\n \"You do, as well. Anybody who\u0027s had contact with a chimera.\"\n \"No! That was what Laughing Boy was after. I refuse to accept his actions were appropriate,\" Chapel demanded.\n \"Call up Angel. Call her right now. Tell her we\u0027re volunteering to go into quarantine. We shouldn\u0027t be out in public.\"\n Her legs quaked visibly beneath her. She dropped to the floor, her hands rushing up to cover her face.\n \"Oh my God,\" she said. \"Chapel, we could be dying right now, and not know it. That fucking chimera might have killed me just by breathing in my face. We could already be dead. What the hell have you done to my life?\"\n Chapel might have said something, but just then his phone began to ring. He dug it out of his jacket and stared at it. The number on the screen read (000) 000-0000.\n ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+28:55\n Chapel set the phone down on the bed. It continued to ring.\n \"Just answer it,\" Julia told him.\n Without a word he touched the screen to answer the call. He placed the phone against his ear.\n \"Chapel,\" Angel told him, \"please put me on speaker. You both need to hear what I\u0027m going to say.\"\n Chapel did as he was told. He set the phone down on the comforter on top of the bed. He sat down in a chair and tried not to look at Julia.\n \"Doctor Taggart,\" Angel said, \"I know what you just heard must come as quite a shock.\"\n \"You . . . heard all that?\" Chapel asked.\n \"Give me some credit, Chapel. I\u0027m a spy. I eavesdrop for a living. You muffled one of my microphones, but you forgot there\u0027s a normal wired telephone in the room.\"\n Chapel looked over at the bedside table and saw it, an old beige model with a big red light that lit up if you had messages. It was such an antique piece of technology now that he hadn\u0027t even registered it. That had been a dumb mistake. Chapel knew about infinity mikes, bugs that allowed any telephone to be used as a listening device-even if the handset was resting on its cradle. He should have thought of that.\n \"Doctor Taggart,\" Angel said, \"you\u0027ve already shown your strength. So I won\u0027t lie to you now. Chapel\u0027s correct. You may have the virus. You may be infected already, or you could be a carrier. If you are, then you may need to be quarantined. And most likely that quarantine will be lifelong, or at least as long as it takes us to come up with some cure for the virus.\"\n Julia wasn\u0027t looking at the phone. She had wrapped her arms around her knees and was gently rocking back and forth.\n \"I can give you a little comfort, though,\" Angel went on. \"Information on the virus is strictly need to know. But if anybody needs to know, it\u0027s you. The virus is about as fragile as the HIV virus. Once you have it, there\u0027s no way for your immune system to conquer it. But it is difficult to get from casual contact. When you were with the chimera, did he bite or scratch you? I know you\u0027ll tell me the truth.\"\n \"No,\" Julia said, rubbing at her nose with the palm of her hand. \"He grabbed my wrists and held me down. He screamed in my face. He may have abraded my skin, and he may have gotten some saliva on me.\"\n Angel sighed in relief. \"That\u0027s good. That\u0027s pretty low on the risk scale. We can\u0027t totally rule out an infection, but . . . your chances are good. I promise.\"\n \"Yeah?\" Julia said, looking up.\n \"Beyond that, the virus has a pretty long incubation period. Several months, in fact. And you\u0027re not contagious, even if you do have it. You won\u0027t be for a long time.\"\n \"Okay,\" Julia said, letting out a deep breath.\n \"Director Hollingshead feels the best place for you now is with Chapel. He can make sure you stay safe. We don\u0027t want you to come in just yet. At the moment, we can\u0027t even detect the virus if it\u0027s in your system. When that changes, we\u0027ll make sure you\u0027re tested-so you\u0027ll know. You\u0027ll know for sure. Only then do we need to start talking about what to do next.\"\n \"Thank you,\" Julia said.\n \"We will take care of you. No matter what, we\u0027ll make sure of that.\"\n \"I appreciate it,\" Julia said. A teardrop fell from her left eye.\n \"It\u0027s the very least we can do. Now, I\u0027m going to have to talk to Chapel in private for a while. And I imagine you could use some time to be alone with your thoughts, after everything you\u0027ve learned.\"\n \"That would be nice,\" Julia confirmed.\n \"Chapel, please put in your earpiece. Maybe you could go outside and let Julia be alone while we talk.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to let her out of my sight, not after the last time, when Laughing Boy-\"\n \"Laughing Boy is in a hospital about twenty miles from you, waiting to see if he\u0027s going to keep his toes,\" Angel said. \"By the way, Doctor Taggart-nice shooting.\"\n Julia laughed, though there were tears in her eyes. \"You know I was trying to kill him, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"He deserved nothing less. I\u0027m just glad you made him pay. Now. Chapel?\"\n \"Okay, okay,\" Chapel said, and grabbed the phone and the hands-free unit. \"You going to be okay?\" he asked Julia.\n She glared at him.\n Crap. It looked like Angel had relieved a little of her fear-but just enough to let her get angry at him again.\n Maybe stepping outside for a while was an excellent idea.\n ATLANTA, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+29:02\n A long balcony ran outside the motel room, allowing access to all the rooms on that floor. Chapel felt exposed walking up and down, past all the curtains of the other rooms, but there was nothing for it. \"Was all that true, what you told her?\" he asked.\n \"Absolutely. I imagine it\u0027s going to be some comfort to you, too, sweetie,\" Angel said. There was a distinct note of sadness in her voice. \"After all, you had a lot more physical contact with the chimera than she did.\"\n \"And there are three more of them out there,\" Chapel said. \"I\u0027m going to probably have contact with them as well.\"\n \"You\u0027d be in your rights to be concerned about that,\" Angel told him.\n \"I know what my job is. I didn\u0027t join the army because I thought it was going to be safe.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure Director Hollingshead will be glad to hear that.\"\n Chapel didn\u0027t want to think about it. He didn\u0027t want to think about the fact that he might spend the rest of his life locked up in a camp in the Catskills. \"We need to get back to work,\" he said. That was the best way to take his mind off it, he knew.\n He filled her in briefly on what Funt had told him. About CIA hit squads and Laughing Boy-and that Funt definitely knew something about the chimeras. He even knew the name of the one coming for him.\n \"I guess that explains why he\u0027s on the kill list,\" Angel pointed out.\n \"Absolutely. Christina Smollett is still a mystery, but it\u0027s starting to look like this is definitely a CIA hit list. I want to take a look at the rest of the names. My feeling is that William Taggart and Franklin Hayes are the next two targets after Funt. But maybe I\u0027m wrong. Who else do we have?\"\n Angel tapped away at her keyboard for a while.\n \"Marcia Kennedy and Olivia Nguyen,\" Angel said. \"Kennedy is in Vancouver and Nguyen lives in Seattle.\"\n Chapel nodded to himself. They would both be safe for the moment-it would take longer for the chimeras to get to either of those cities than it would take them to get to Denver. \"What do they do for a living?\" Chapel asked.\n \"Huh. Kennedy works at a flower shop. She\u0027s filed some tax forms, but not regularly-only for about ten years in the last twenty. She\u0027s a Canadian citizen, but she wasn\u0027t born there. Looks like her parents moved to Canada in the nineties and she went with them. She was naturalized in 1998, the same year as her parents.\"\n \"So it\u0027s a close family-do they live together?\"\n \"No . . . but,\" Angel said, and clucked her tongue for a second as if she was thinking, \"the parents have a house in the suburbs. She lives a little closer in to the downtown area in a studio apartment. Okay, here. The lease is cosigned by her father, Arthur Kennedy. Looks like she was the one who signed the lease in the first place, but the building owners sued her for failure to pay her rent in 2002. After that the father cosigned, and it looks like the rent\u0027s been paid faithfully ever since.\"\n \"She probably doesn\u0027t make much money working in a flower shop,\" Chapel pointed out.\n \"True . . . wow. Cool. I\u0027ve got to remember how to do this.\"\n \"You found something?\"\n \"Her resume is online, with one of those services that helps you get interviews. Interesting. She\u0027s worked on and off at the flower shop, on for eight or ten months, off for four or six months. Just about every year she seems to quit, and then comes back and gets rehired a while later.\"\n \"That sounds promising. Maybe the job at the flower shop is just a cover, and she takes off long stretches every year to do undercover work for the CIA.\"\n \"Watching Canada to make sure those rascally northerners don\u0027t try anything?\" Angel asked, with a laugh.\n \"I\u0027m looking for connections here,\" Chapel said. \"I admit that\u0027s a stretch.\"\n \"Let me take a look at something. Her medical records should be online and easy to get since Canada has nationalized health coverage. Oh.\"\n \"What did you find?\"\n Angel clucked her tongue again. \"Let me just check what this does . . . okay. Sure. She\u0027s on carbamazepine. That explains a lot.\"\n \"What is it?\" Chapel asked.\n \"Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant,\" Angel said, \"which would suggest epilepsy, but it\u0027s also used in the treatment of severe bipolar disorder. Which fits her information pretty well. She can function for most of the year but every so often she probably gets a period of intense depression where she can\u0027t get out of bed, so that\u0027s why she works sporadically and why she had trouble paying her rent.\"\n Chapel leaned on the balcony railing and closed his eyes. \"You\u0027re saying she\u0027s mentally ill. Just like Christina Smollett.\"\n \"Her disease probably isn\u0027t as profound, but, yeah,\" Angel told him.\n What could it mean? Why on earth would the chimeras be targeting mentally ill women? It was the one fact of the case that he couldn\u0027t comprehend at all. Christina Smollett and Marcia Kennedy couldn\u0027t possibly have done any meaningful work for the CIA, or the DoD, or any other governmental agency. They would never have passed the necessary background checks to get clearance. They didn\u0027t have backgrounds in genetics research, either. They even lived on opposite sides of the continent . . . it just didn\u0027t add up.\n \"Okay,\" he said. \"Okay. You\u0027ve already told me there are no red herrings on this list. No false leads. But this is looking just plain weird. I hate to ask, but-Olivia Nguyen. Is there anything there?\"\n Angel worked her magic for a while in silence. When she came back on the line, she sounded almost afraid to tell him what she\u0027d found.\n \"Her address is listed as 2600 Southwest Holden Street, in Seattle.\"\n \"It\u0027s a hospital, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"A psychiatric hospital, yes. She\u0027s been a patient there since 1981.\"\n STONE MOUNTAIN, GEORGIA: APRIL 13, T+34:48\n Chapel and Julia waddled forward in line with the tourists and sightseers headed to the top of Stone Mountain. Chapel had traded his button-down shirt for a polo that let him fit in a little better. Even this early in the year, most of the people in line for the Skyride were wearing T-shirts and shorts, though most of the women carried windbreakers or sweaters. It was supposed to be cooler up top.\n \"You still giving me the silent treatment?\" Chapel asked.\n \"Huh,\" Julia said, not looking up. She read aloud from a brochure she\u0027d picked up while Chapel bought their tickets for the cable car. \"I didn\u0027t know. This was the first project for Gutzon Borglum. He didn\u0027t finish it, though.\"\n Apparently she was talking to him, now. She just wouldn\u0027t look at him.\n He didn\u0027t suppose he blamed her. He\u0027d made a fair share of mistakes with her. He should have told her about the virus. He should have found some way to protect her without bringing her here, without nearly getting her blown up. He should have killed Laughing Boy when he had the chance so she would be safe now.\n That was a lot of should haves. It was going to take a while before things thawed out between them, he thought.\n \"Who\u0027s Gutzon Borglum?\" Chapel asked, shuffling forward. The line was taking forever. He\u0027d wanted to be on top of the mountain at least an hour before his scheduled meeting with Funt, but it looked like they would have to wait for the next car.\n \"The man who carved Mount Rushmore,\" Julia told him. \"The monument at Stone Mountain was commissioned by the United Daughters of the Confederacy,\" she read, \"in 1916. It took nearly fifty years to complete.\"\n Chapel leaned to one side to take a look at the mountain. He\u0027d had other things on his mind and hadn\u0027t really bothered to check out the sculpture.\n \"It\u0027s the largest bas-relief in the world,\" Julia read.\n Chapel could believe it.\n Stone Mountain lived up to its name. It looked like a single piece of enormous rock towering over the nearby landscape, a dome of gray granite almost denuded of trees. From where Chapel stood it rose over him like a sheer wall. Carved into that massive rock face was a portrait of the South\u0027s three greatest heroes: Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis, and Robert E. Lee. From a distance the carvings hadn\u0027t looked like much, but from the base of the mountain they were colossal and incredibly detailed. It looked like the three giants on horseback were going to leap out of the stone at any moment and go racing across the country, capes flapping in the wind, the heads of the horses rearing, as the three men rode to glory.\n Angel snorted in his ear. \"What the brochure doesn\u0027t tell you is that this is where the modern Ku Klux Klan was officially organized, and where they had their big rallies until the eighties.\"\n \"During the Olympics,\" Julia read, \"Stone Mountain facilities were used for the archery, tennis, and track cycling events.\" She folded the brochure and put it in her purse. \"Are we going to have to wait for the next car?\" she asked, and a moment later they watched the Skyride lift away from the ground, headed upward across the carving toward the very top.\n \"Looks like it,\" Chapel said.\n \"Chapel,\" Angel said in his ear, \"I know what I said last time, about your being a jerk when you left Julia behind. But I also know you made the right choice, no matter how angry she is with you now. You should leave Julia down here. Just try to say it in a nicer way this time.\"\n \"Not a chance,\" he told her. Julia looked at him for a second as if she thought he was talking to her. Chapel tapped the hands-free unit in his ear and Julia rolled her eyes and turned away.\n \"Listen, sugar,\" Angel said, \"if Funt is up there and you start asking him questions with Julia around, she\u0027s going to hear everything. That\u0027s not a good thing. Secrets don\u0027t work if everybody knows them.\"\n \"The last time I spoke with him I left her behind. Look how that turned out,\" Chapel said. \"No, I can\u0027t let her out of my sight anymore.\"\n \"Director Hollingshead doesn\u0027t want her hearing any of this,\" Angel pointed out. \"You know that, Chapel.\"\n Chapel sighed. He knew it perfectly well. He knew he was exceeding the limits of need to know. He was, frankly, taking a running leap and jumping as far as he could humanly get past those limits.\n He glanced at Julia. She was part of this. She had a right to know. And maybe that exceeded the right of Hollingshead and Angel and the entire government to keep things from her.\n He couldn\u0027t very well say that, of course. He was a silent warrior. The kind of man who could be trusted to keep his mouth shut.\n Or at least, he\u0027d thought that was who he was.\n \"She\u0027s coming with me,\" he told Angel.\n The operator was silent for a long time. \"You\u0027ve been given a lot of latitude on how you work this case,\" she said, finally. \"That latitude can be taken away. If Director Hollingshead needs to rein you in, he will.\"\n \"Is that a threat, Angel?\"\n \"It\u0027s a friendly warning!\" she said, sounding exasperated. \"I want you to succeed, sweetie. I want you to win this thing. Why are you fighting me?\"\n Chapel wasn\u0027t entirely certain himself. But he\u0027d begun to suspect something. He\u0027d known for a while that Angel-and Hollingshead-had their own agenda in this. That capturing or killing the chimeras was only part of what they wanted to accomplish.\n Maybe it was time he had his own agenda. Maybe it was time to start thinking about what he wanted to get out of this. He looked at Julia again. This time she looked back, a question on her face.\n He still didn\u0027t know what he wanted to happen. He didn\u0027t know how this could end well for anyone. But he was going to make sure Julia came out of this alive. That was a start. Alive, and, if he had anything to say about it, free.\n If that fit into Hollingshead\u0027s secret plan, so be it. If not-Chapel would have to start making up his own rules for this game.\n He had more important things to worry about just then, though. The time for his meeting with Funt was drawing near. He hadn\u0027t counted on having to wait in line to get to the top of the mountain.\n \"We\u0027re going to cut it pretty close,\" Chapel said, staring at his watch. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chimera-a-jim-chapel-mission-jim-chapel-1/page-15.html","bookId":1585,"book":{"id":1585,"title":"Chimera: A Jim Chapel Mission (Jim Chapel #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Chimera: A Jim Chapel Mission (Jim Chapel #1) \n Wounded Special Forces veteran Jim Chapel has been stuck behind a desk rather than out in the field, but medical technology has finally caught up with his ambitions.
