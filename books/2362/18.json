{"id":68492,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Catherine was in a state of shock. She sat on the couch in her hotel room, listening to Lieutenant Hans Bergman, head of the ski patrol, tell her that Kirk Reynolds was dead. The sound of Bergman\u0027s voice flowed over Catherine in waves, but she was not listening to the words. She was too numbed by the horror of what had happened. All the people around me die, she thought despairingly. Larry\u0027s dead, and now Kirk. And there were the others: Noelle, Napoleon Chotas, Frederick Stavros. It was an unending nightmare.\n Vaguely, through the fog of her despair, she heard Hans Bergman\u0027s voice. \"Mrs. Reynolds...Mrs. Reynolds...\"\n She raised her head. \"I\u0027m not Mrs. Reynolds,\" she said wearily. \"I\u0027m Catherine Alexander. Kirk and I were...were friends.\"\n I see.\n Catherine took a deep breath. \"How...how did it happen? Kirk was such a good skier.\"\n \"I know. He skied here many times.\" He shook his head. \"To tell you the truth, Miss Alexander, I\u0027m puzzled about what happened. We found his body on the Lagalp, a slope that was closed because of an avalanche last week. The sign must have been blown down by the wind. I\u0027m terribly sorry.\"\n Sorry. What a weak word, what a stupid word.\n \"How would you like us to handle the funeral arrangements, Miss Alexander?\"\n So death was not the end. No, there were arrangements to be made. Coffins and burial plots, and flowers, and relatives to be notified. Catherine wanted to scream.\n \"Miss Alexander?\"\n Catherine looked up. \"I\u0027ll notify Kirk\u0027s family.\"\n \"Thank you.\"\n The trip back to London was a mourning. She had come up to the mountains with Kirk filled with eager hope, thinking that it was, perhaps, a new beginning, a door to a new life.\n Kirk had been so gentle and so patient. I should have made love with him, Catherine thought. But in the end, would it really have mattered? What did anything matter? I\u0027m under some kind of curse. I destroy everyone who comes near me.\n When Catherine returned to London, she was too depressed to go back to work. She stayed in the flat, refusing to see anyone or talk to anyone. Anna, the housekeeper, prepared meals for her and took them to Catherine\u0027s room, but the trays were returned untouched.\n \"You must eat something, Miss Alexander.\"\n But the thought of food made Catherine ill.\n The next day Catherine was feeling worse. She felt as though her chest were filled with iron. She found it difficult to breathe.\n I can\u0027t go on like this, Catherine thought. I have to do something.\n She discussed it with Evelyn Kaye.\n \"I keep blaming myself for what happened.\"\n \"That doesn\u0027t make sense, Catherine.\"\n \"I know it doesn\u0027t, but I can\u0027t help it. I feel responsible. I need someone to talk to. Maybe if I saw a psychiatrist...\"\n \"I know one who\u0027s awfully good,\" Evelyn said. \"As a matter of fact, he sees Wim from time to time. His name is Alan Hamilton. I had a friend who was suicidal, and by the time Dr. Hamilton was through treating her, she was in great shape. Would you like to see him?\"\n What if he tells me I\u0027m crazy? What if I am? \"All right,\" Catherine said reluctantly.\n \"I\u0027ll try to make the appointment for you. He\u0027s pretty busy.\"\n \"Thanks, Evelyn. I appreciate it.\"\n Catherine went into Wim\u0027s office. He would want to know about Kirk, she thought.\n \"Wim - do you remember Kirk Reynolds? He was killed a few days ago in a skiing accident.\"\n \"Yeah? Westminster-oh-four-seven-one.\"\n Catherine blinked. \"What?\" And she suddenly realized that Wim was reciting Kirk\u0027s telephone number. Was that all people meant to Wim? A series of numbers? Didn\u0027t he have any feelings for them? Was he really unable to love or hate or feel compassion?\n Perhaps he\u0027s better off than I am, Catherine thought. At least he\u0027s spared the terrible pain that the rest of us can feel.\n Evelyn arranged an appointment for Catherine with Dr. Hamilton for the following Friday. Evelyn thought of telephoning Constantin Demiris to tell him what she had done, but she decided it was too unimportant to bother him about.\n Alan Hamilton\u0027s office was on Wimpole Street. Catherine went there for her first appointment, apprehensive and angry. Apprehensive because she was fearful of what he might say about her, and angry with herself for having to rely on a stranger to help her with problems she felt she should have been able to solve herself.\n The receptionist behind the glass window said, \"Dr. Hamilton is ready for you, Miss Alexander.\"\n But am I ready for him? Catherine wondered. She was filled with a sudden panic. What am I doing here? I\u0027m not going to put myself in the hands of some quack who probably thinks he\u0027s God.\n Catherine said, \"I - I\u0027ve changed my mind. I don\u0027t really need to see the doctor. I\u0027ll be happy to pay for the appointment.\"\n \"Oh? Just a moment, please.\"\n \"But...\"\n The receptionist had disappeared into the doctor\u0027s office.\n A few moments later, the door to the office opened and Alan Hamilton came out. He was in his early forties, tall and blond, with bright blue eyes and an easy manner.\n He looked at Catherine and smiled. \"You\u0027ve made my day,\" he said.\n Catherine frowned. \"What...?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t realize how good a doctor I really was. You just walked into my reception office, and you\u0027re already feeling better. That must be some kind of record.\"\n Catherine said defensively, \"I\u0027m sorry. I made a mistake. I don\u0027t need any help.\"\n \"I\u0027m delighted to hear that,\" Alan Hamilton said. \"I wish all my patients felt that way. As long as you\u0027re here, Miss Alexander, why don\u0027t you come in for a moment? We\u0027ll have a cup of coffee.\"\n \"Thank you, no. I don\u0027t...\"\n \"I promise you can drink it sitting up.\"\n Catherine hesitated. \"All right, just for a minute.\"\n She followed him into his office. It was very simple, done in quiet, good taste, furnished more like a living room than an office. There were soothing prints hanging on the walls, and on a coffee table was a photograph of a beautiful woman with a young boy. All right, so he has a nice office and an attractive family. What does that prove?\n \"Please sit down,\" Dr. Hamilton said. \"The coffee should be ready in a minute.\"\n \"I really shouldn\u0027t be wasting your time, doctor. I\u0027m...\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about that.\" He sat in an easy chair, studying her. \"You\u0027ve been through a lot,\" he said sympathetically.\n \"What do you know about it?\" Catherine snapped. Her tone was angrier than she had intended.\n \"I spoke with Evelyn. She told me what happened at St. Moritz. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n That damned word again. \"Are you? If you\u0027re such a wonderful doctor, maybe you can bring Kirk back to life.\" All the misery that had been pent up inside her broke, erupting in a torrent, and to her horror Catherine found that she was sobbing hysterically. \"Leave me alone,\" she screamed. \"Leave me alone.\"\n Alan Hamilton sat there watching her, saying nothing.\n When Catherine\u0027s sobs finally subsided she said wearily, \"I\u0027m sorry. Forgive me. I really must go now.\" She rose and started toward the door.\n \"Miss Alexander, I don\u0027t know whether I can help you, but I\u0027d like to try. I can promise you only that whatever I do won\u0027t hurt you.\"\n Catherine stood at the door, undecided. She turned to look at him, her eyes filled with tears. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the matter with me,\" she whispered. \"I feel so lost.\"\n Alan Hamilton rose and walked over to her. \"Then why don\u0027t we try to find you? We\u0027ll work on it together. Sit down. I\u0027ll see about that coffee.\"\n He was gone for five minutes, and Catherine sat there, wondering how he had talked her into staying. He had a calming effect. There was something in his manner that was reassuring.\n Maybe he can help me, Catherine thought.\n Alan Hamilton came back into the room carrying two cups of coffee. \"There\u0027s cream and sugar, if you like.\"\n \"No, thank you.\"\n He sat down across from her. \"I understand your friend died in a skiing accident.\"\n It was so painful to talk about. \"Yes. He was on a slope that was supposed to have been closed. The wind blew the sign down.\"\n \"Is this your first encounter with the death of someone close to you?\"\n How was she supposed to answer that? Oh, no. My husband and his mistress were executed for trying to murder me. Everyone around me dies. That would shake him up. He was sitting there, waiting for an answer, the smug son of a bitch. Well, she wouldn\u0027t give him the satisfaction. Her life was none of his business. I hate him.\n Alan Hamilton saw the anger in her face. He deliberately changed the subject. \"How\u0027s Wim?\" he asked.\n The question threw Catherine completely off guard. \"Wim? He - he\u0027s fine. Evelyn told me he\u0027s a patient of yours.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Can you explain how he - why he - is like he is?\"\n \"Wim came to me because he kept losing jobs. He\u0027s something very rare - a genuine misanthrope. I can\u0027t go into the reasons why, but basically, he hates people. He is unable to relate to other people.\"\n Catherine remembered Evelyn\u0027s words. He has no emotions. He\u0027ll never get attached to anyone.\n \"But Wim is brilliant with mathematics,\" Alan Hamilton went on. \"He\u0027s in a job now where he can apply that knowledge.\"\n Catherine nodded. \"I\u0027ve never known anyone like him.\"\n Alan Hamilton leaned forward in his chair. \"Miss Alexander,\" he said, \"what you\u0027re going through is very painful, but I think I might be able to make it easier for you. I\u0027d like to try.\"\n \"I...I don\u0027t know,\" Catherine said. \"Everything seems so hopeless.\"\n \"As long as you feel that way,\" Alan Hamilton smiled, \"there\u0027s nowhere to go but up, is there?\" His smile was infectious. \"Why don\u0027t we set just one more appointment? If at the end of that one you still hate me, we\u0027ll call it quits.\"\n \"I don\u0027t hate you,\" Catherine said apologetically. \"Well, a little bit maybe.\"\n Alan Hamilton walked over to his desk and studied his calender. His schedule was completely booked.\n \"What about Monday?\" he asked. \"One o\u0027clock?\" One o\u0027clock was his lunch hour, but he was willing to forego that. Catherine Alexander was a woman carrying an unbearable burden, and he was determined to do everything he could to help her.\n Catherine looked at him a long moment. \"All right.\"\n \"Fine. I\u0027ll see you then.\" He handed her a card. \"In the meantime, if you need me, here\u0027s my office number and my home number. I\u0027m a light sleeper, so don\u0027t worry about waking me up.\"\n \"Thank you,\" Catherine said. \"I\u0027ll be here Monday.\"\n Dr. Alan Hamilton watched her walk out the door and he thought, She\u0027s so vulnerable, and so beautiful. I have to be careful. He looked at the photograph on his coffee table. I wonder what Angela would think?\n The call came in the middle of the night.\n Constantin Demiris listened, and when he spoke his voice was filled with surprise. \"The Thele sank? I can\u0027t believe it.\"\n \"It\u0027s true, Mr. Demiris. The coast guard found a few pieces of the wreckage.\"\n \"Were there any survivors?\"\n \"No, sir. I\u0027m afraid not. All hands were lost.\"\n \"That\u0027s terrible. Does anyone know how it happened?\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ll never know, sir. All the evidence is at the bottom of the sea.\"\n \"The sea,\" Demiris murmured, \"the cruel sea.\"\n \"Shall we go ahead and file an insurance claim?\"\n \"It\u0027s hard to worry about things like that when all those brave men have lost their lives - but yes, go ahead and file the claim.\" He would keep the vase in his private collection.\n Now it was time to punish his brother-in-law. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memories-of-midnight/page-18.html","bookId":2362,"book":{"id":2362,"title":"Memories of Midnight","description":"Storyline: \n In THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT, they played the ultimate game of love, lust, and death. \n Now, in MEMORIES OF MIDNIGHT, the survivors meet to play one last time... \n Shadowed by tragedy and burdened by amnesia, a beautiful woman desperately tries to return to reality.
