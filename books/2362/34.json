{"id":68508,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"Five days before the trial of Constantin Demiris was to begin, the jailor opened up his cell door. \"You have a visitor.\" Constantin Demiris looked up. Except for his attorney, he had been permitted no visitors until now. He refused to show any curiosity. The bastards were treating him like a common criminal. But he would not give them the satisfaction of showing any emotion. He followed the jailor down the hall into a small conference room. \"In there.\" Demiris stepped inside and stopped. A crippled old man was hunched over in a wheelchair. His hair was snow white. His face was a ghastly patchwork of red and white burn tissue. His lips were frozen upward in a horrible rictus of a smile. It took a moment for him to realize who his visitor was. His face turned ashen. \"My God!\" \"I\u0027m not a ghost,\" Napoleon Chotas said. His voice was a hoarse rasp. \"Come in, Costa.\" Demiris found his voice. \"The fire...\" \"I jumped out a window and broke my back. My butler got me away before the firemen arrived. I didn\u0027t want you to know I was still alive. I was too tired to fight you any longer.\" \"But...they found a body.\" \"My houseman.\" Demiris sank into a chair. \"I...I\u0027m glad you\u0027re alive,\" he said feebly. \"You should be. I\u0027m going to save your life.\" Demiris studied him warily. \"You are?\" \"Yes. I\u0027m going to defend you.\" Demiris laughed aloud. \"Really, Leon. After all these years, do you take me for a fool? What makes you think I would put my life in your hands?\" \"Because I\u0027m the only one who can save you, Costa.\" Constantin Demiris rose. \"No, thanks.\" He started toward the door. \"I\u0027ve talked to Spyros Lambrou. I\u0027ve persuaded him to testify that he was with you at the time his sister was murdered.\" Demiris stopped and turned. \"Why would he do that?\" Chotas leaned forward in his wheelchair. \"Because I persuaded him that taking your fortune would be a sweeter revenge than taking your life.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"I assured Lambrou that if he testifies for you, you\u0027ll turn over your entire fortune to him. Your ships, your companies - everything you possess.\" \"You\u0027re crazy!\" \"Am I? Think about it, Costa. His testimony can save your life. Is your fortune worth more to you than your life?\" There was a long silence. Demiris sat down again. He studied Chotas warily. \"Lambrou is willing to testify that I was with him when Melina was killed?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"And in return he wants - \" \"Everything you have.\" Demiris shook his head. \"I would have to keep my...\" \"Everything. He wants to strip you completely. You see, that\u0027s his revenge.\" There was something that puzzled Demiris. \"And what do you get out of all this, Leon?\" Chotas\u0027s lips moved in a parody of a grin. \"I get it all.\" \"I - I don\u0027t understand.\" \"Before you turn the Hellenic Trade Corporation over to Lambrou, you\u0027re going to transfer all of its assets into a new company. A company that belongs to me.\" Demiris stared at him. \"So, Lambrou gets nothing.\" Chotas shrugged. \"There are winners and there are losers.\" \"Won\u0027t Lambrou suspect something?\" \"Not the way I\u0027ll handle it.\" Demiris said, \"If you\u0027d double-cross Lambrou, how do I know you won\u0027t double-cross me?\" \"It\u0027s very simple, my dear Costa. You\u0027re protected. We\u0027ll have a signed agreement that the new company will belong to me only on the condition that you are acquitted. If you are found guilty, I get nothing.\" For the first time, Constantin Demiris found himself becoming interested. He sat there studying the crippled lawyer. Would he throw the trial and lose hundreds of millions of dollars just to get even with me? No. He\u0027s not that big a fool. \"All right,\" Demiris said slowly. \"I agree.\" Chotas said, \"Good. You just saved your life, Costa.\" I\u0027ve saved more than that, Demiris thought triumphantly. I have a hundred million dollars hidden away where no one will ever find it. Chotas\u0027s meeting with Spyros Lambrou had been a difficult one. He almost threw Chotas out of his office. \"You want me to testify to save that monster\u0027s life? Get the hell out of here.\" \"You want revenge, don\u0027t you?\" Chotas had asked. \"Yes. And I\u0027m getting it.\" \"Are you? You know Costa. His wealth means more to him than his life. If they execute him, his pain will be over in a few minutes, but if you break him and take everything away from him, force him to go through life without any money, you would be giving him a much greater punishment.\" There was truth in what the lawyer said. Demiris was the greediest man he had ever met. \"You say that he\u0027s willing to sign everything he has over to me?\" \"Everything. His fleet, his businesses, every company he owns.\" It was an enormous temptation. \"Let me think about it.\" Lambrou watched the lawyer wheel himself out of his office. Poor bastard, he thought. What has he got to live for? At midnight, Spyros Lambrou telephoned Napoleon Chotas. \"I\u0027ve made up my mind. We have a deal.\" The press was in a feeding frenzy. Not only was Constantin Demiris being tried for the murder of his wife, but he was being defended by a man who had come back from the dead, the brilliant criminal attorney who had supposedly died in a holocaust. The trial was being held in the same courtroom where Noelle Page and Larry Douglas had been tried. Constantin Demiris sat at the defendant\u0027s table, cloaked in an aura of invisibility. Napoleon Chotas was next to him in his wheelchair. The State was being represented by Special Prosecutor Delma. Delma was addressing the jury. \"Constantin Demiris is one of the most powerful men in the world. His vast fortune gives him many privileges. But there\u0027s one privilege it does not give him. And that\u0027s the right to commit cold-blooded murder. No one has that right.\" He turned to look at Demiris. \"The state will prove beyond a doubt that Constantin Demiris is guilty of the brutal murder of a wife who loved him. When you are through hearing the evidence, I\u0027m certain that there\u0027s only one verdict you can bring in. Guilty of murder in the first degree.\" He walked back to his seat. The Chief Justice turned to Napoleon Chotas. \"Is the defense ready to make it\u0027s opening statement?\" \"We are, Your Honor.\" Chotas wheeled himself in front of the jury. He could see the look of pity on their faces as they tried to avoid looking at his grotesque face and his crippled body. \"Constantin Demiris is not on trial here because he\u0027s rich or powerful. Or perhaps it\u0027s because of that that he has been dragged into this courtroom. The weak always try to bring down the powerful, don\u0027t they? Mr. Demiris may be guilty of being rich and powerful, but one thing I am going to prove with absolute certainty - he is not guilty of murdering his wife.\" The trial had begun. Prosecutor Delma was questioning Police Lieutenant Theophilos on the stand. \"Would you describe what you saw when you walked into Demiris\u0027s beach house, Lieutenant?\" \"The chairs and tables were overturned. Everything was all messed up.\" \"It looked as though a terrible struggle had taken place?\" \"Yes, sir. It looked as though the house had been burglarized.\" \"You found a bloody knife at the scene of the crime, did you not?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"And there were fingerprints on the knife?\" \"That\u0027s correct.\" \"Who did they belong to?\" \"Constantin Demiris.\" The eyes of the jury swung toward Demiris. \"When you searched the house, what else did you find?\" \"In back of a closet we found a pair of blood-stained bathing shorts that had Demiris\u0027s initials on them.\" \"Isn\u0027t it possible that they had been at the house for a long time?\" \"No, sir. They were still wet with sea water.\" \"Thank you.\" It was Napoleon Chotas\u0027s turn. \"Detective Theophilos, you had a chance to talk to the defendant personally, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"How would you describe him physically?\" \"Well...\" The detective looked over to where Demiris was sitting. \"I would say he was a big man.\" \"Did he look strong? I mean physically strong?\" \"Yes.\" \"Not the sort of man who would have to tear a room apart in order to kill his wife.\" Delma was on his feet. \"Objection.\" \"Sustained. The defense attorney will refrain from leading the witness.\" \"I apologize, Your Honor.\" Chotas turned to the detective. \"In your conversation with Mr. Demiris, would you evaluate him as an intelligent man?\" \"Yes, sir. I don\u0027t think you become as rich as he is unless you\u0027re pretty smart.\" \"I couldn\u0027t agree with you more, Lieutenant. And that leads us to an interesting question. How could a man like Constantin Demiris be stupid enough to commit a murder and leave behind at the scene of the crime a knife with his fingerprints on it, a blood-stained pair of shorts...? Wouldn\u0027t you say that was not very intelligent?\" \"Well, sometimes in the heat of committing a crime, people do strange things.\" \"The police found a gold button from a jacket Demiris was supposed to be wearing? Is that correct?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"And that\u0027s an important part of the evidence against Mr. Demiris. The police theory is that his wife tore it off in the struggle when he tried to kill her?\" \"That\u0027s correct.\" \"So, we have a man who habitually dressed very neatly. A button is ripped off the front of his jacket but he doesn\u0027t notice it. He wears the jacket home and he still doesn\u0027t notice it. Then he takes it off and hangs it up in his closet - and he still doesn\u0027t notice it. That would make the defendant not only stupid, but blind.\" Mr. Katelanos was on the stand. The owner of the detective agency was making the most of his moment in the sun. Delma was questioning him. \"You\u0027re the owner of a private detective agency?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"And a few days before Mrs. Demiris was murdered, she came to see you?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"What did she want?\" \"Protection. She said she was going to divorce her husband and he had threatened to kill her.\" There was a murmur from the spectators. \"So, Mrs. Demiris was very upset?\" \"Oh, yes, sir. She certainly was.\" \"And she engaged your agency to protect her from her husband?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"That\u0027s all, thank you.\" Delma turned to Chotas. \"Your witness.\" Chotas wheeled his chair over to the witness stand. \"Mr. Katelanos, how long have you been in the detective business?\" \"Almost fifteen years.\" Chotas was impressed. \"Well. That\u0027s a long time. You really must be very good at what you do.\" \"I suppose I am,\" Katelanos said modestly. \"So, you\u0027ve had a lot of experience in dealing with people who are in trouble.\" \"That\u0027s why they come to me,\" Katelanos said smugly. \"And when Mrs. Demiris came to you, did she seem a little bit upset, or...\" \"Oh, no. She was very upset. You might say panicky.\" \"I see. Because she was afraid her husband was about to kill her.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"So, when she left your office, how many of your operatives did you send with her? One? Two?\" \"Well, no. I didn\u0027t send any with her.\" Chotas frowned. \"I don\u0027t understand. Why not?\" \"Well, she said she didn\u0027t want us to start until Monday.\" Chotas looked at him, baffled. \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re confusing me, Mr. Katelanos. This woman who came to your office terrified that her husband was going to kill her just walked out and said she wouldn\u0027t need any protection until Monday?\" \"Well, yes. That\u0027s right.\" Napoleon Chotas said, almost to himself, \"It makes one wonder how frightened Mrs. Demiris really was, doesn\u0027t it?\" The Demiris maid was on the witness stand. \"Now, you actually heard a conversation between Mrs. Demiris and her husband on the telephone?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Would you tell us what that conversation was?\" \"Well, Mrs. Demiris told her husband she wanted a divorce and he said he wouldn\u0027t give it to her.\" Delma glanced at the jury. \"I see.\" He turned back to the witness. \"What else did you hear?\" \"He asked her to meet him at the beach house at three o\u0027clock, and to go alone.\" \"He said that she should come alone?\" \"Yes, sir. And she said if she didn\u0027t get back by six, I was to call the police.\" There was a visible reaction from the jury. They turned to stare at Demiris. \"No more questions.\" Delma turned to Chotas. \"Your witness.\" Napoleon Chotas wheeled his chair close to the witness stand. \"Your name is Andrea, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes, sir.\" She tried not to look at the scarred, disfigured face. \"Andrea, you said that you heard Mrs. Demiris tell her husband that she was going to get a divorce and that you heard Mr. Demiris say that he wouldn\u0027t give it to her, and that he told her to come to the beach house at three and to come alone. Is that right?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You are under oath, Andrea. That\u0027s not what you heard at all.\" \"Oh, yes, it is, sir.\" \"How many telephones are there in the room where this conversation took place?\" \"Why, just one.\" Napoleon Chotas wheeled his chair closer. \"So, you weren\u0027t listening to the conversation on another phone?\" \"No, sir. I would never do that.\" \"So, the truth is, you only heard what Mrs. Demiris said. It would have been impossible for you to hear what her husband said.\" \"Oh. Well, I suppose...\" \"In other words, you did not hear Mr. Demiris threaten his wife or ask her to come to the beach house or anything else. You imagined all that because of what Mrs. Demiris was saying.\" Andrea was flustered. \"Well, I suppose you could put it that way.\" \"I am putting it that way. Why were you in the room when Mrs. Demiris was on the telephone?\" \"She asked me to bring her some tea.\" \"And you brought it?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You set it down on a table.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you leave then?\" \"Mrs. Demiris waved for me to stay.\" \"She wanted you to hear the conversation or what was supposed to be a conversation?\" \"I...I suppose so.\" His voice was a whiplash. \"So, you don\u0027t know whether she was talking to her husband on the phone or if, in fact, she was talking to anybody.\" Chotas moved his chair even closer. \"Don\u0027t you find it strange that in the middle of a personal conversation, Mrs. Demiris asked you to stay there and listen? I know that in my house if we\u0027re having a personal discussion we don\u0027t ask the staff to eavesdrop. No. I put it to you that that conversation never took place. Mrs. Demiris wasn\u0027t speaking to anyone. She was setting up her husband so that on this day in this courtroom he would be put on trial for his life. But Constantin Demiris did not kill his wife. The evidence against him was very carefully planted. It was planted too carefully. No intelligent man would leave a series of obvious clues behind that pointed to himself. And no matter what else he is, Constantin Demiris is an intelligent man.\" The trial went on for ten more days with accusations and counteraccusations, and expert testimony from the police and the coroner. The consensus of opinion was that Constantin Demiris was probably guilty. Napoleon Chotas saved his bombshell until the end. He put Spyros Lambrou on the witness stand. Before the trial started, Demiris had signed a notarized contract deeding the Hellenic Trade Corporation and all its assets to Spyros Lambrou. A day earlier, those assets had been secretly transferred to Napoleon Chotas with the proviso that it would take effect only if Constantin Demiris was acquitted in his trial. \"Mr. Lambrou. You and your brother-in-law, Constantin Demiris, did not get along well, did you?\" \"No, we did not.\" \"As a matter of fact, would it be a fair statement to say that you hated each other?\" Lambrou looked over at Constantin Demiris. \"It might even be an understatement.\" \"On the day your sister disappeared, Constantin Demiris told the police that he was nowhere near the beach house; that, in fact, at three o\u0027clock, the time established for your sister\u0027s death, he was having a meeting with you in Acrocorinth. When the police questioned you about that meeting, you denied it.\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"Why?\" Lambrou sat there for a long moment. His voice was filled with anger. \"Demiris treated my sister shamefully. He constantly abused and humiliated her. I wanted him punished. He needed me for an alibi. I wouldn\u0027t give it to him.\" \"And now?\" \"I can\u0027t live with a lie any longer. I feel I have to tell the truth.\" \"Did you and Constantin Demiris meet at Acrocorinth that afternoon?\" \"Yes, the truth is that we did.\" There was an uproar in the courtroom. Delma rose to his feet, his face pale. \"Your Honor. I object...\" \"Objection denied.\" Delma sank back into his seat. Constantin Demiris was leaning forward, his eyes bright. \"Tell us about that meeting. Was it your idea?\" \"No. It was Melina\u0027s idea. She tricked us both.\" \"Tricked you, how?\" \"Melina telephoned me and said that her husband wanted to meet me at my lodge up there to discuss a business deal. Then she called Demiris and told him that I had asked for a meeting up there. When we arrived, we found that we had nothing to say to each other.\" \"And the meeting took place in the middle of the afternoon at the established time of Mrs. Demiris\u0027s death?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"It\u0027s a four-hour drive from Acrocorinth to the beach house. I\u0027ve had it timed.\" Napoleon Chotas was looking at the jury. \"So, there is no way that Constantin Demiris could have been at Acrocorinth at three and been back in Athens before seven.\" Chotas turned back to Spyros Lambrou. \"You are under oath, Mr. Lambrou. Is what you have just told this court the truth?\" \"Yes. So help me God.\" Napoleon Chotas swiveled his chair toward the jury. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he rasped, \"there is only one verdict you can possibly reach.\" They were straining forward to catch his words. \"Not quilty. If the State had claimed that the defendant had hired someone to kill his wife, then there might have been some small measure of doubt. But, on the contrary, their whole case is based upon so-called evidence that the defendant was in that room, that he himself murdered his wife. The learned justices will instruct you that in this trial two essential elements must be proven: motive and opportunity. \"Not motive or opportunity, but motive and opportunity. In law, they are Siamese twins - inseparable. Ladies and gentlemen, the defendant may or may not have had a motive, but this witness has proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant was nowhere near the scene of the crime when it occurred.\" The jury was out for four hours. Constantin Demiris watched as they filed back into the courtroom. He looked pale and anxious. Chotas was not looking at the jury. He was looking at Constantin Demiris\u0027s face. Demiris\u0027s aplomb and arrogance were gone. He was a man facing death. The Chief Justice asked, \"Has the jury reached a verdict?\" \"We have, Your Honor.\" The jury foreman held up a piece of paper. \"Would the bailiff get the verdict, please.\" The bailiff walked over to the juror, took the piece of paper, and handed it to the judge. He opened the piece of paper and looked up. \"The jury finds the defendant not guilty.\" There was pandemonium in the courtroom. People were getting to their feet, some of them applauding, some of them hissing. The expression on Demiris\u0027s face was ecstatic. He took a deep breath, rose, and walked over to Napoleon Chotas. \"You did it,\" he said. \"I owe you a lot.\" Chotas looked into his eyes. \"Not anymore. I\u0027m very rich and you\u0027re very poor. Come on. We\u0027re going to celebrate.\" Constantin Demiris pushed Chotas\u0027s wheelchair through the milling crowd, out past the reporters, to the parking lot. Chotas pointed to a sedan parked at the entrance. \"My car\u0027s over there.\" Demiris wheeled him up to the door. \"Don\u0027t you have a chauffeur?\" \"I don\u0027t need one. I had this car specially fitted so I could drive it myself. Help me in.\" Demiris opened the door and lifted Chotas into the driver\u0027s seat. He folded the wheelchair and put it in the backseat. Demiris got into the car next to Chotas. \"You\u0027re still the greatest lawyer in the world,\" Constantin Demiris smiled. \"Yes.\" Napoleon Chotas put the car in gear and started to drive. \"What are you going to do now, Costa?\" Demiris said carefully, \"Oh, I\u0027ll manage to get by somehow.\" With a hundred million dollars I can build up my empire again. Demiris chuckled. \"Spyros is going to be pretty upset when he finds out how you tricked him.\" \"There\u0027s nothing he can do about it,\" Chotas assured him. \"The contract he signed gives him a company that\u0027s worthless.\" They were headed toward the mountains. Demiris watched as Chotas moved the levers that controlled the gas pedal and the brake. \"You handle this very well.\" \"You learn to do what you have to,\" Chotas said. They were climbing up a narrow mountain road. \"Where are we going?\" \"I have a little house at the top here. We\u0027ll have a glass of champagne and I\u0027ll have a taxi take you back to town. You know, Costa, I\u0027ve been thinking. Everything that\u0027s happened...Noelle\u0027s death and Larry Douglas\u0027s death. And poor Stavros. None of it was about money, was it?\" He turned to glance at Demiris. \"It was all about hate. Hate and love. You loved Noelle.\" \"Yes,\" Demiris said. \"I loved Noelle.\" \"I loved her too,\" Chotas said. \"You didn\u0027t know that, did you?\" Demiris looked at him in surprise. \"No.\" \"And yet I helped you murder her. I\u0027ve never forgiven myself for that. Have you forgiven yourself, Costa?\" \"She deserved what she got.\" \"I think in the end we all deserve what we get. There\u0027s something I haven\u0027t told you, Costa. That fire - ever since the night of that fire, I\u0027ve been in excruciating pain. The doctors tried to put me back together again, but it didn\u0027t really work. I\u0027m too badly crippled.\" He pushed a lever that speeded up the car. They were starting to move fast along hairpin curves, climbing higher and higher. The Aegean Sea appeared far below them. \"As a matter of fact,\" Chotas said hoarsely, \"I\u0027m in so much pain that my life really isn\u0027t worth living anymore.\" He pushed the lever again, and the car began to move faster. \"Slow down,\" Demiris said. \"You\u0027re going too...\" \"I\u0027ve stayed alive this long for you. I\u0027ve decided that you and I are going to end it together.\" Demiris turned to stare at him, horrified. \"What are you talking about? Slow down, man. You\u0027ll kill us both.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" Chotas said. He moved the lever again. The car leaped forward. \"You\u0027re crazy!\" Demiris said. \"You\u0027re rich. You don\u0027t want to die.\" Chotas\u0027s scarred lips turned into a horrific imitation of a smile. \"No, I\u0027m not rich. You know who\u0027s rich? Your friend, Sister Theresa. I\u0027ve given all your money to the convent at Ioannina.\" They were racing toward a blind curve on the steep mountain road. \"Stop the car!\" Demiris screamed. He tried to wrest the wheel from Chotas but it was impossible. \"I\u0027ll give you anything you want,\" Demiris yelled. \"Stop!\" Chotas said, \"I have what I want.\" The next moment they were flying over the cliff, down the steep mountainside, the car tumbling end over end in a grotesque pirouette of death, until finally at the bottom it crashed into the sea. There was a tremendous explosion, and then the deep silence of eternity.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memories-of-midnight/page-34.html","bookId":2362,"book":{"id":2362,"title":"Memories of Midnight","description":"Storyline: In THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT, they played the ultimate game of love, lust, and death.
