But first, I\u0027m going to destroy your sister. Constantin Demiris\u0027s words were still ringing in Lambrou\u0027s ears. He had no doubt that Demiris would try to carry out his threat. What in God\u0027s name could have gone wrong with Rizzoli? Everything had been so carefully planned. But there was no time to speculate on what had happened. The important thing now was to warn his sister. Lambrou\u0027s secretary walked into the office. \"Your ten o\u0027clock appointment is waiting. Shall I send...?\" \"No. Cancel all my appointments. I won\u0027t be back this morning.\" He picked up a telephone, and five minutes later he was on his way to see Melina. She was waiting for him in the garden of the villa. \"Spyros. You sounded so upset on the phone! What\u0027s wrong?\" \"We have to talk.\" He led her to a bench in a vine-covered gazebo. He sat there looking at her and thought, What a lovely woman she is. She\u0027s always brought happiness to everyone her life has touched. She\u0027s done nothing to deserve this. \"Aren\u0027t you going to tell me what\u0027s wrong?\" Lambrou took a deep breath. \"This is going to be very painful, darling.\" \"You\u0027re beginning to alarm me.\" \"I mean to. Your life is in danger.\" \"What? In danger from whom?\" He measured his words carefully. \"I think Costa is going to try to kill you.\" Melina was staring at him, open-mouthed. \"You\u0027re joking.\" \"No, I mean it, Melina.\" \"Darling, Costa is a lot of things, but he\u0027s not a murderer. He couldn\u0027t...\" \"You\u0027re wrong. He\u0027s killed before.\" Her face had gone pale. \"What are you saying?\" \"Oh, he doesn\u0027t do it with his bare hands. He hires people to do it for him, but...\" \"I don\u0027t believe you.\" \"Do you remember Catherine Douglas?\" \"The woman who was murdered...\" \"She wasn\u0027t murdered. She\u0027s alive.\" Melina shook her head. \"She - she couldn\u0027t be. I mean - they executed the people who killed her.\" Lambrou took his sister\u0027s hand in his. \"Melina, Larry Douglas and Noelle Page didn\u0027t kill Catherine. All the time the trial was going on, Demiris had her hidden away.\" Melina sat there stunned, speechless, remembering the woman she had caught a glimpse of at the house. Who is the woman I saw in the hall? She\u0027s a friend of a business associate. She\u0027s going to work for me in London. I caught a glimpse of her. She reminds me of someone. She reminds me of the wife of the pilot who used to work for you. But that\u0027s impossible, of course. They murdered her. Yes, they murdered her. She found her voice. \"I saw her at the house, Spyros. Costa lied to me about her.\" \"He\u0027s insane. I want you to pack up and get out of this place.\" She looked at him and said slowly, \"No, this is my home.\" \"Melina, I couldn\u0027t bear it if anything happened to you.\" There was steel in her voice. \"Don\u0027t worry. Nothing will happen to me. Costa is no fool. He knows that if he did anything to harm me he would have to pay dearly for it.\" \"He\u0027s your husband, but you don\u0027t know him. I\u0027m afraid for you.\" \"I can handle him, Spyros.\" He looked at her and knew that there was no way he could persuade her to change her mind. \"If you won\u0027t leave, do me a favor. Promise you won\u0027t be alone with him.\" She patted her brother\u0027s cheek. \"I promise.\" Melina had no intention of keeping that promise. When Constantin Demiris arrived home that evening, Melina was waiting for him. He nodded to her and walked past her into his bedroom. Melina followed him. \"I think it\u0027s time we had a talk,\" Melina said. Demiris looked at his watch. \"I only have a few minutes. I have an engagement.\" \"Have you? Are you planning to murder someone else tonight?\" He turned to her. \"What are you raving about?\" \"Spyros came by to see me this morning.\" \"I\u0027m going to have to warn your brother to stay away from my house.\" \"It\u0027s my house too,\" Melina said defiantly. \"We had a very interesting chat.\" \"Really? About what?\" \"About you and Catherine Douglas and Noelle Page.\" She had his full attention now. \"That\u0027s ancient history.\" \"Is it? Spyros says you sent two innocent people to their deaths, Costa.\" \"Spyros is a fool.\" \"I saw the girl here, in this house.\" \"No one will believe you. You won\u0027t see her again. I\u0027ve sent someone to get rid of her.\" And Melina suddenly remembered the three men who had come to dinner. You\u0027ll be flying to London early in the morning. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll take care of everything that needs to be done. He moved closer to Melina and said softly, \"You know, I\u0027m really getting quite fed up with you and your brother.\" He took her arm and squeezed it hard. \"Spyros tried to ruin me. He should have killed me instead.\" He squeezed harder. \"Both of you are going to wish he had.\" \"Stop it, you\u0027re hurting me.\" \"My dear wife, you don\u0027t know what pain is yet. But you will.\" He let go of her arm. \"I\u0027m getting a divorce. I want a real woman. But I won\u0027t be out of your life. Oh, no. I have some wonderful plans for you and your dear brother. Well, we\u0027ve had our little talk. If you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027ll go in and change. It\u0027s not polite to keep a lady waiting.\" He turned and walked into his dressing room. Melina stood there, her heart pounding. Spyros was right. He\u0027s a madman. She felt completely helpless, but she wasn\u0027t afraid for her own life. What do I have to live for? Melina thought bitterly. Her husband had stripped her of all dignity and brought her down to his level. She thought of all the times he had humiliated her, abused her in public. She knew that she was an object of pity among her friends. No, she was no longer concerned about herself. I\u0027m ready to die, she thought, but I can\u0027t let him harm Spyros. And yet what could she do to stop him? Spyros was powerful, but her husband was more powerful. Melina knew with a terrible certainty that if she let him, her husband would carry out his threat. I must stop him somehow. But how? How...?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memories-of-midnight/page-21.html","bookId":2362,"book":{"id":2362,"title":"Memories of Midnight","description":"Storyline: In THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT, they played the ultimate game of love, lust, and death.
