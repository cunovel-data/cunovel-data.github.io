He was booked, and fingerprinted again. He had his picture taken, and was placed in a prison cell. It was unbelievable that they would dare do this to him. \"Get me Peter Demonides. Tell him I want to see him right now.\" \"Mr. Demonides has been relieved of his duties. He\u0027s under investigation.\" So there was no one to turn to. I\u0027ll get out of this, he thought. I\u0027m Constantin Demiris. He sent for the special prosecutor. Delma arrived at the prison one hour later. \"You asked to see me?\" \"Yes,\" Demiris said. \"I understand you\u0027ve established the time of my wife\u0027s death at three o\u0027clock.\" \"That is correct.\" \"Then before you embarrass yourself and the police department any further, I can prove that I was nowhere near the beach house at that hour yesterday.\" \"You can prove that?\" \"Of course. I have a witness.\" They were seated in the police commissioner\u0027s office when Spyros Lambrou arrived. Demiris\u0027s face lit up when he saw him. \"Spyros, thank God you\u0027re here! These idiots think I murdered Melina. You know I couldn\u0027t have. Tell them.\" Spyros Lambrou frowned. \"Tell them what?\" \"Melina was killed at three o\u0027clock yesterday afternoon. You and I were together at Acrocorinth at three o\u0027clock. I couldn\u0027t have driven back to the beach house before seven. Tell them about our meeting.\" Spyros Lambrou was staring at him. \"What meeting?\" The blood began to drain from Demiris\u0027s face. \"The...the meeting you and I had yesterday. At the lodge at Acrocorinth.\" \"You must be confused, Costa. I was out driving alone yesterday afternoon. I\u0027m not going to lie for you.\" Constantin Demiris\u0027s face filled with rage. \"You can\u0027t do this!\" He grabbed the lapels of Lambrou\u0027s jacket. \"Tell them the truth.\" Spyros Lambrou pushed him away. \"The truth is that my sister is dead and you murdered her.\" \"Liar!\" Demiris screamed. \"Liar!\" He started toward Lambrou again and it took two policemen to restrain him. \"You son of a bitch. You know I\u0027m innocent!\" \"The judges will decide that. I think you need a good lawyer.\" And Constantin Demiris realized that there was only one man who could have saved him. Napoleon Chotas.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memories-of-midnight/page-27.html","bookId":2362,"book":{"id":2362,"title":"Memories of Midnight","description":"Storyline: In THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT, they played the ultimate game of love, lust, and death.
