{"id":68479,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"Why did you let her leave the house?\" Constantin Demiris demanded. \"I\u0027m sorry, sir,\" the butler replied. \"You didn\u0027t say anything about her not leaving, so...\" Demiris forced himself to appear calm. \"It\u0027s not important. She\u0027ll probably be back soon.\" \"Is there anything else, sir?\" \"No.\" He watched the butler go. Demiris walked over to a window and stared out at the impeccably manicured garden. It was dangerous for Catherine Alexander to appear in the streets of Athens, where someone might recognize her. It\u0027s too bad I can\u0027t afford to let her live. But first - my vengeance. She\u0027ll stay alive until I take my revenge. I\u0027m going to enjoy myself with her. I\u0027ll send her away from here, somewhere where no one will know her.London will be safe. We can keep an eye on her. I\u0027ll give her a job at my offices there. An hour later, when Catherine returned to the house, Constantin Demiris could sense instantly the change in her. It was as though some dark curtain had been lifted and Catherine had suddenly come alive. She was wearing an attractive white silk suit, with a white blouse - and Demiris was taken aback by how much her appearance had changed. Nostimi, he thought. Sexy. \"Mr. Demiris...\" \"Costa.\" \"I...I know who I am, and - and what happened.\" His face revealed nothing. \"Really? Sit down, my dear, and tell me.\" Catherine was too excited to sit. She began to pace jerkily on the carpet, back and forth, the words tumbling out of her. \"My husband and his - his mistress, Noelle, tried to kill me.\" She stopped, looking at him anxiously. \"Does that sound crazy? I - I don\u0027t know. Maybe it is.\" \"Go on, my dear,\" he said soothingly. \"Some nuns from the convent saved me. My husband worked for you, didn\u0027t he?\" she blurted out. Demiris hesitated, carefully weighing his answer. \"Yes.\" How much should he tell her? \"He was one of my pilots. I felt a sense of responsibility toward you. That\u0027s only...\" She faced him. \"But you knew who I was. Why didn\u0027t you tell me this morning?\" \"I was afraid of the shock,\" Demiris said smoothly. \"I thought it better to let you discover things for yourself.\" \"Do you know what happened to my husband and that - that woman? Where are they?\" Demiris looked into Catherine\u0027s eyes. \"They were executed.\" He watched the blood drain from her face. She made a small sound. She suddenly felt too weak to stand and sank into a chair. \"I don\u0027t...\" \"They were executed by the state, Catherine.\" \"But...why?\" Careful. Danger. \"Because they tried to murder you.\" Catherine frowned. \"I don\u0027t understand. Why would the state execute them? I\u0027m alive...\" He broke in. \"Catherine, Greek laws are very strict. And justice here is swift. They had a public trial. A number of witnesses testified that your husband and Noelle Page attempted to kill you. They were convicted, and sentenced to death.\" \"It\u0027s hard to believe,\" Catherine sat there, dazed. \"The trial...\" Constantin Demiris walked over to her and put his hand on her shoulder. \"You must put the past out of your mind. They tried to do an evil thing to you, and they paid for it.\" He struck a more buoyant tone. \"I think you and I should discuss the future. Do you have any plans?\" She did not hear him. Larry, she thought. Larry\u0027s handsome face, laughing. Larry\u0027s arms, his voice... \"Catherine...\" She looked up. \"I\u0027m sorry?\" \"Have you had any thoughts about your future?\" \"No, I...I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do. I suppose I could stay in Athens...\" \"No,\" Demiris said firmly. \"That wouldn\u0027t be a good idea. It would bring back too many unpleasant memories. I would suggest that you leave Greece.\" \"But I have nowhere to go.\" \"I\u0027ve given it some thought,\" Demiris told her. \"I have offices in London. You once worked for a man named William Fraser in Washington. Do you remember that?\" \"William...?\" And suddenly she did remember it. That had been one of the happiest times of her life. \"You were his administrative assistant, I believe.\" \"Yes, I...\" \"You could do the same job for me in London.\" She hesitated. \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t want to seem ungrateful, but...\" \"I understand. I know everything seems to be happening very quickly,\" Demiris said sympathetically. \"You need some time to think about all this. Why don\u0027t you have a nice quiet dinner in your room, and in the morning we\u0027ll discuss it further.\" Asking her to have dinner in her room was a last-minute inspiration. He could not afford to have his wife run into her. \"You\u0027re very thoughtful,\" Catherine said. \"And very generous. The clothes are...\" He patted her hand and held it a fraction longer than necessary. \"It\u0027s my pleasure.\" She sat in her bedroom watching the blazing sun set over the blue Aegean in an explosion of color. There is no point in reliving the past. There is the future to think about. Thank God for Constantin Demiris. He was her lifeline. Without him, she would have had no one to turn to. And he had offered her a job in London. Am Igoing to take it? Her thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. \"We\u0027ve brought your dinner, miss.\" Long after Catherine had gone, Constantin Demiris sat in the library thinking about their conversation. Noelle. Only once in his life had Demiris permitted himself to lose control of his emotions. He had fallen deeply in love with Noelle Page, and she had become his mistress. He had never known a woman like her. She was knowledgeable about art, and music, and business, and she had become indispensable. Nothing about Noelle surprised him. Everything about Noelle surprised him. He was obsessed with her. She was the most beautiful, the most sensual woman Demiris had ever known. She had given up stardom to be at his side. Noelle had stirred emotions in him that he had never felt before. She was his lover, his confidante, his friend. Demiris had trusted her completely and she had betrayed him with Larry Douglas. It was a mistake Noelle had paid for with her life. Constantin Demiris had arranged with the authorities for her body to be buried on the grounds of the cemetery on Psara, his private island in the Aegean. Everyone had remarked on what a beautiful, sentimental gesture it was. In fact, Demiris had arranged for the burial plot to be there so that he could have the exquisite pleasure of walking over the bitch\u0027s grave. At Demiris\u0027s bedside in his own bedroom was a photograph of Noelle at her loveliest, looking up at him and smiling. Forever smiling, frozen in time. Even now, more than a year later, Demiris was unable to stop thinking about her. She was an open wound that no doctor could ever heal. Why, Noelle, why? I gave you everything. I loved you, you bitch. I loved you. I love you. And then there was Larry Douglas. He had paid with his life. But that was not enough for Demiris. He had another vengeance in mind. A perfect one. He was going to take his pleasure with Douglas\u0027s wife as Douglas had done with Noelle. Then he would send Catherine to join her husband. \"Costa...\" It was his wife\u0027s voice. Melina walked into the library. Constantin Demiris was married to Melina Lambrou, an attractive woman from an old, aristocratic Greek family. She was tall and regal looking, with an innate dignity. \"Costa, who is the woman I saw in the hall?\" Her voice was tense. The question caught him off guard. \"What? Oh. She\u0027s a friend of a business associate,\" Demiris said. \"She\u0027s going to work for me in London.\" \"I caught a glimpse of her. She reminds me of someone.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes.\" Melina hesitated. \"She reminds me of the wife of the pilot who used to work for you. But that\u0027s impossible, of course. They murdered her.\" \"Yes,\" Constantin Demiris agreed. \"They murdered her.\" He watched Melina as she walked away. He would have to be careful. Melina was no fool. I never should have married her, Demiris thought. It was a bad mistake... Ten years earlier, the wedding of Melina Lambrou and Constantin Demiris had sent shock waves through business and social circles from Athens to the Riviera to Newport. What had made it so titillating was that only one month before the wedding the bride had been engaged to marry another man. As a child, Melina Lambrou had dismayed her family by her willfulness. When she was ten, she decided she wanted to be a sailor. The family chauffeur found her at the harbor, trying to sneak aboard a ship, and brought her home in disgrace. At twelve, she tried to run away with a traveling circus. By the time Melina was seventeen, she was resigned to her fate - she was beautiful, fabulously wealthy, and the daughter of Mihalis Lambrou. The newspapers loved to write about her. She was a fairy-tale figure whose playmates were princesses and princes, and through it all, by some miracle, Melina had managed to remain unspoiled. Melina had one brother, Spyros, who was ten years older than she, and they adored each other. Their parents had died in a boating accident when Melina was thirteen, and it was Spyros who had reared her. Spyros was extremely protective of her - too much so, Melina thought. As Melina reached her late teens, Spyros became even more wary about Melina\u0027s suitors, and he carefully examined each candidate for his sister\u0027s hand. Not one of them proved to be good enough. \"You have to be careful,\" he constantly counseled Melina. \"You\u0027re a target for every fortune hunter in the world. You\u0027re young and rich and beautiful, and you bear a famous name.\" \"Bravo, my dear brother. That will be of immense comfort to me when I\u0027m eighty years old and die an old maid.\" \"Don\u0027t worry, Melina. The right man will come along.\" His name was Count Vassilis Manos and he was in his middle forties, a successful businessman from an old and distinguished Greek family. The count had fallen in love instantly with the beautiful young Melina. His proposal came only a few weeks after they met. \"He\u0027s perfect for you,\" Spyros said happily. \"Manos has his feet on the ground, and he\u0027s crazy about you.\" Melina was less enthusiastic. \"He\u0027s not exciting, Spyros. When we\u0027re together, all he talks about is business, business, business. I wish he were more - more romantic.\" Her brother said firmly, \"There\u0027s more to marriage than romance. You want a husband who is solid and stable, someone who will devote himself to you.\" And finally Melina was persuaded to accept Count Manos\u0027s proposal. The count was thrilled. \"You\u0027ve made me the happiest man in the world,\" he declared. \"I\u0027ve just formed a new company. I\u0027m going to name it Melina International.\" She would have preferred a dozen roses. The wedding date was set, one thousand invitations were sent out, and elaborate plans were made. It was then that Constantin Demiris entered Melina Lambrou\u0027s life. They met at one of the dozen or so engagement parties that were being given for the betrothed pair. The hostess introduced them. \"This is Melina Lambrou - Constantin Demiris.\" Demiris stared at her with his brooding black eyes. \"How long will they let you stay?\" he asked. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"Surely you\u0027ve been sent from the heavens to teach us mortals what beauty is.\" Melina laughed. \"You\u0027re very flattering, Mr. Demiris.\" He shook his head. \"You\u0027re beyond flattery. Nothing I could say would do you justice.\" At that moment Count Manos approached and interrupted the conversation. That night, just before falling asleep, Melina thought about Demiris. She had heard about him, of course. He was wealthy, he was a widower, and he had the reputation of being a ruthless businessman and a compulsive womanizer. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m not involved with him, Melina thought. The gods were laughing. The morning after the party, Melina\u0027s butler walked into the breakfast room. \"A package has arrived for you, Miss Lambrou. It was delivered by Mr. Demiris\u0027s chauffeur.\" \"Bring it in, please.\" So Constantin Demiris thinks he\u0027s going to impress me with his wealth. Well, he\u0027s in for a big disappointment. Whatever he\u0027s sent...whether it\u0027s an expensive piece of jewelry, or some priceless antique...I\u0027m going to send it right back to him. The package was small and oblong, and beautifully wrapped. Curious, Melina opened it. The card read, simply: \"I thought you might enjoy this. Constantin.\" It was a leather-bound copy of Toda Raba by Nikos Kazantzakis, her favorite author. How could he have known? Melina wrote a polite thank-you note, and thought: That\u0027s that. The following morning another package arrived. This time it was a recording by Delius, her favorite composer. The note read: \"You might enjoy listening to this while reading Toda Raba.\" From that day on there were gifts every day. Her favorite flowers, and perfume, and music, and books. Constantin Demiris had taken the trouble to find out what Melina\u0027s tastes were, and she could not help but be flattered by his attention. When Melina telephoned to thank Demiris, he said: \"There\u0027s nothing I could ever give you that would do you justice.\" How many women had he said that to before? \"Will you have lunch with me, Melina?\" She started to say no, and then thought: It can\u0027t hurt to have lunch with the man. He\u0027s been very thoughtful. \"Very well.\" When she mentioned to Count Manos that she was having lunch with Constantin Demiris, he objected. \"What\u0027s the point, my dear? You have nothing in common with that terrible man. Why are you going to see him?\" \"Vassilis, he\u0027s been sending me little gifts every day. I\u0027m going to tell him to stop.\" And even as Melina said it, she thought: I could have told him that over the telephone. Constantin Demiris had made reservations at the popular Floca restaurant on Panepistimiou Street and he was waiting for Melina when she arrived. He rose. \"You\u0027re here. I was so afraid you might change your mind.\" \"I always keep my word.\" He looked at her and said solemnly: \"And I keep mine. I\u0027m going to marry you.\" Melina shook her head, half amused, half annoyed. \"Mr. Demiris, I\u0027m engaged to many someone else.\" \"Manos?\" He waved a hand in dismissal. \"He\u0027s not right for you.\" \"Oh, really? And why is that?\" \"I\u0027ve checked on him. Insanity runs in his family, he\u0027s a hemophiliac, he\u0027s wanted by the police on a sex charge in Brussels, and he plays a dreadful game of tennis.\" Melina could not help laughing. \"And you?\" \"I don\u0027t play tennis.\" \"I see. And that\u0027s why I should marry you?\" \"No. You\u0027ll marry me because I\u0027m going to make you the happiest woman who ever lived.\" \"Mr. Demiris...\" He covered her hand with his. \"Costa.\" She withdrew her hand. \"Mr. Demiris, I came here today to tell you that I want you to stop sending me gifts. I don\u0027t intend to see you again.\" He studied her for a long moment. \"I\u0027m sure you are not a cruel person.\" \"I hope not.\" He smiled. \"Good. Then you won\u0027t want to break my heart.\" \"I doubt if your heart is that easily broken. You have quite a reputation.\" \"Ah, that was before I met you. I\u0027ve dreamed about you for a long time.\" Melina laughed. \"I\u0027m serious. When I was a very young man, I used to read about the Lambrou family. You were very rich and I was very poor. I had nothing. We lived from hand to mouth. My father was a stevedore who worked on the docks of Piraeus. I had fourteen brothers and sisters, and we had to fight for everything we wanted.\" In spite of herself, she was touched. \"But now you are rich.\" \"Yes. Not as rich as I am going to be.\" \"What made you rich?\" \"Hunger. I was always hungry. I\u0027m still hungry.\" She could read the truth in his eyes. \"How did you...how did you get started?\" \"Do you really want to know?\" And Melina found herself saying, \"I really want to know.\" \"When I was seventeen, I went to work for a small oil company in the Middle East. I was not doing very well. One night I had dinner with a young geologist who worked for a large oil company. I ordered a steak that night, and he ordered only soup. I asked him why he didn\u0027t have a steak, and he said it was because he had no back teeth and he couldn\u0027t afford to buy dentures. I gave him fifty dollars to buy new teeth. A month later he telephoned me in the middle of the night to tell me he had just discovered a new oil deposit. He hadn\u0027t told his employer about it yet. In the morning, I started borrowing every cent I could, and by evening I had bought options on all the land around the new discovery. It turned out to be one of the biggest oil deposits in the world.\" Melina was hanging on his every word, fascinated. \"That was the beginning. I needed tankers to ship my oil in, so in time I acquired a fleet. Then a refinery. Then an airline.\" He shrugged. \"It went on from there.\" It was not until long after they were married that Melina learned that the story about the steak was pure fiction. Melina Lambrou had had no intention of seeing Constantin Demiris again. But, by a series of carefully arranged coincidences, Demiris invariably managed to appear at the same party, or theater, or charity event, that Melina was attending. And each time, she felt his overpowering magnetism. Beside him, Vassilis Manos seemed - she hated to admit it, even to herself - boring. Melina Lambrou was fond of the Flemish painters, and when Bruegel\u0027s \"Hunters in the Snow\" came on the market, before she could purchase it, Constantin Demiris sent it to her as a gift. Melina was fascinated by his uncanny knowledge of her tastes. \"I can\u0027t accept such an expensive gift from you,\" she protested. \"Ah, but it\u0027s not a gift. You must pay for it. Dinner with me tonight.\" And she finally agreed. The man was irresistible. A week later Melina broke off her engagement to Count Manos. When Melina told her brother the news he was stunned. \"Why, in heaven\u0027s name?\" Spyros asked. \"Why?\" \"Because I\u0027m going to marry Constantin Demiris.\" He was aghast. \"You must be crazy. You can\u0027t marry Demiris. He\u0027s a monster. He\u0027ll destroy you. If...\" \"You\u0027re wrong about him, Spyros. He\u0027s wonderful. And we\u0027re in love. It\u0027s...\" \"You\u0027re in love,\" he snapped. \"I don\u0027t know what he\u0027s after, but it has nothing to do with love. Do you know what his reputation is with women? He...\" \"That\u0027s all in the past, Spyros. I\u0027m going to be his wife.\" And there was nothing he could do to talk his sister out of the wedding. A month later Melina Lambrou and Constantin Demiris were married. In the beginning it seemed to be a perfect marriage. Constantin was amusing and attentive. He was an exciting and passionate lover, and he constantly surprised Melina with lavish gifts and trips to exotic places. On the first night of their honeymoon, he said, \"My first wife was never able to give me a child. Now we\u0027ll have many sons.\" \"No daughters?\" Melina teased. \"If you wish. But a son first.\" The day Melina learned she was pregnant, Constantin was ecstatic. \"He will take over my empire,\" he declared happily. In her third month, Melina miscarried. Constantin Demiris was out of the country when it happened. When he returned and heard the news he reacted like a madman. \"What did you do?\" he screamed. \"How could it happen?\" \"Costa, I...\" \"You were careless!\" \"No, I swear...\" He took a deep breath. \"All right. What\u0027s done is done. We\u0027ll have another son.\" \"I...I can\u0027t.\" She could not meet his eyes. \"What are you saying?\" \"They had to perform an operation. I can\u0027t have another child.\" He stood there, frozen, then turned and stalked out without a word. From that moment on, Melina\u0027s life became a hell. Constantin Demiris carried on as though his wife had deliberately killed his son. He ignored her, and began to see other women. Melina could have borne that, but what made the humiliation so painful was the pleasure he took in publicly flaunting his liaisons. He openly had affairs with movie stars, opera singers, and the wives of some of his friends. He took his lovers to Psara, and on cruises on his yacht, and to public functions. The press gleefully chronicled Constantin Demiris\u0027s romantic adventures. They were at a dinner party at the house of a prominent banker. \"You and Melina must come,\" the banker had said. \"I have a new Oriental chef who makes the best Chinese food in the world.\" The guest list was prestigious. At the dinner table was a fascinating collection of artists, politicians, and industrialists. The food was indeed wonderful. The chef had prepared shark fin soup, shrimp rolls, mu shu pork, Peking duck, spareribs, Canton noodles, and a dozen other dishes. Melina was seated near the host at one end of the table, her husband next to the hostess at the other end. To Demiris\u0027s right was a pretty, young film star. Demiris was concentrating on her, ignoring everyone else at the table. Melina could hear snatches of his conversation. \"When you finish your picture, you must come on my yacht. It will be a lovely vacation for you. We\u0027ll cruise along the Dalmatian coast...\" Melina tried not to listen, but it was impossible. Demiris made no effort to keep his voice down. \"You\u0027ve never been to Psara, have you? It\u0027s a lovely little island, completely isolated. You\u0027ll enjoy it.\" Melina wanted to crawl under the table. But the worst was yet to come. They had just finished the sparerib course, and the butlers were bringing silver finger bowls. As a finger bowl was placed in front of the young star, Demiris said, \"You won\u0027t need that.\" And, grinning, he lifted her hands in his and began slowly to lick the sauce from her fingers, one by one. The other guests averted their eyes. Melina rose to her feet and turned to her host. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, I - I have a headache.\" The guests watched as she fled from the room. Demiris did not come home that night, or the next. When Spyros heard about the incident, he was livid. \"Just give me the word,\" Melina\u0027s brother fumed, \"and I\u0027ll kill the son of a bitch.\" \"He can\u0027t help it,\" Melina defended him. \"It\u0027s his nature.\" \"His nature? He\u0027s an animal! He should be put away. Why don\u0027t you divorce him?\" It was a question Melina Demiris had asked herself often in the still of the long, lonely nights she spent by herself. And it always came down to the same answer: I love him. At five-thirty in the morning, Catherine was awakened by an apologetic maid. \"Good morning, miss...\" Catherine opened her eyes and looked around in confusion. Instead of her tiny cell at the convent, she was in a beautiful bedroom in...Her memory came flooding back. The trip into Athens...You\u0027re Catherine Douglas...They were executed by the state... \"Miss...\" \"Yes?\" \"Mr. Demiris asked if you would join him for breakfast on the terrace.\" Catherine stared up at her sleepily. She had been awake until four o\u0027clock, her mind in a turmoil. \"Thank you. Tell Mr. Demiris I\u0027ll be right there.\" Twenty minutes later a butler escorted Catherine to an enormous terrace facing the sea. There was a low stone wall that overlooked the gardens twenty feet below. Constantin Demiris was seated at a table, waiting. He studied Catherine as she walked toward him. There was an exciting innocence about her. He was going to take it, possess it, make it his. He imagined her naked in his bed, helping him punish Noelle and Larry again. Demiris rose. \"Good morning. Forgive me for awakening you so early, but I must leave for my office in a few minutes, and I wanted the opportunity for us to have a little chat first.\" \"Yes, of course,\" Catherine said. She sat down at the large marble table opposite him, facing the sea. The sun was just rising, showering the sea with a thousand sparkles. \"What would you like for breakfast?\" She shook her head. \"I\u0027m not hungry.\" \"Some coffee perhaps?\" \"Thank you.\" The butler was pouring hot coffee into a Belleek cup. \"Well, Catherine,\" Demiris began. \"Have you thought about our conversation?\" Catherine had thought of nothing else all night. There was nothing left for her in Athens, and she had nowhere else to go. I won\u0027t go back to the convent, she vowed. The invitation to work for Constantin Demiris in London sounded intriguing. In fact, Catherine admitted to herself, it sounds exciting. It could be the beginning of a new life. \"Yes,\" Catherine said, \"I have.\" \"And?\" \"I - I think I would like to try it.\" Constantin Demiris managed to conceal his relief. \"I\u0027m delighted. Have you ever been to London?\" \"No. That is - I don\u0027t think so.\" Why don\u0027t I know for sure? There were still so many frightening gaps in her memory. How many more surprises am I going to get? \"It\u0027s one of the few civilized cities left in the world. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll enjoy it very much.\" Catherine hesitated. \"Mr. Demiris, why are you going to all this trouble for me?\" \"Let\u0027s just say it\u0027s because I feel a sense of responsibility.\" He paused. \"I introduced your husband to Noelle Page.\" \"Ah,\" Catherine said slowly. Noelle Page. The name sent a small shiver through her. The two of them had died for each other. Larry must have loved her so much. Catherine forced herself to ask a question that had been tormenting her all night long. \"How...how were they executed?\" There was a small pause. \"They were shot by a firing squad.\" \"Oh.\" She could feel the bullets tearing into Larry\u0027s flesh, ripping apart the body of the man she had once loved so much. She was sorry she had asked. \"Let me give you some advice. Don\u0027t think about the past. It can only be hurtful. You must put all that behind you.\" Catherine said slowly, \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027ll try.\" \"Good. I happen to have a plane flying to London this morning, Catherine. Can you be ready to leave in a little while?\" Catherine thought of all the trips she had taken with Larry, the excited preparations, the packing, the anticipation. This time, there would be no one to go with, little to pack, and nothing to prepare for. \"Yes. I can be ready.\" \"Excellent. By the way,\" Demiris said casually, \"now that your memory has returned, perhaps there\u0027s someone you\u0027d like to get in touch with, someone from your past whom you would like to let know that you\u0027re all right.\" The name that instantly sprang to her mind was William Fraser. He was the only one in the world who remained from her past. But she knew she was not ready to face him yet. When I get settled, Catherine thought. When I start working again, I\u0027ll get in touch with him. Constantin Demiris was watching her, waiting for her answer. \"No,\" Catherine said finally. \"There\u0027s no one.\" She had no idea that she had just saved William Fraser\u0027s life. \"I\u0027ll arrange a passport for you.\" He handed her an envelope. \"This is an advance on your salary. You won\u0027t have to worry about a place to live. The company has a flat in London. You\u0027ll stay there.\" It was overwhelming. \"You\u0027re much too generous.\" He took her hand in his. \"You\u0027ll find that I\u0027m...\" He changed what he was going to say. Handle her carefully, he thought. Slowly. You don\u0027t want to scare her away. \"...that I can be a very good friend.\" \"You are a very good friend.\" Demiris smiled. Wait. Two hours later, Constantin Demiris helped Catherine into the backseat of the Rolls-Royce that was to take her to the airport. \"Enjoy London,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be in touch with you.\" Five minutes after the car departed, Demiris was on the telephone to London. \"She\u0027s on her way.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/memories-of-midnight/page-5.html","bookId":2362,"book":{"id":2362,"title":"Memories of Midnight","description":"Storyline: In THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT, they played the ultimate game of love, lust, and death.
