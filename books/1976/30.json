He’s tall, husky, with jet-black hair similar to Marco’s. He wears a black button-down shirt, grey slacks and has a gold chain around his neck. And like the children, his face is also obscured. He marches with confidence, each stride firm and in control. He’s intimidating and disturbs my nerves. “It’s time to go,” his voice ices out at the children. “Get your asses back to the castle.” “Where are we going?” the girl asks as she clutches onto the boy’s hand. “That’s none of your business!” the man bellows. “You never ask me questions. Do you understand?” I hear the soft tread of approaching footsteps and then a slender figure dashes by me. She has long brown hair and she’s wearing a floral dress. I think it might be the mother and daughter from the field. She scoops the girl up in her arms and hugs her protectively. “You stay the hell away from her!” she shouts at the man. Her presence brings warmth to the darkness the man instilled and the two combine to create a recipe of emotions that makes me nauseous. I squat down to the ground, feeling like I’m going to throw up. “This is not your decision,” the man snaps and, in two long strides, is standing in her face. “You knew when she was born that this would have to happen one day.” “Mommy, I’m scared,” the girl whispers as she buries her head into her mother’s shoulder. The mother smoothes back the girl’s hair and kisses the top of her head. “It’s going to be okay, sweetie. You don’t need to be scared. I promise I won’t let anything happen to you.” “I’d like to see you try.” The man turns to the boy and points his finger at a hill. “Go inside, right now.” The boy glances from the man to the girl, torn on what to do. “I don’t want to.” “Don’t you dare mouth off to me!” the man shouts and the skin on his neck tints red. “Now, get your ass inside!” “Sorry, sir.” The boy’s voice shakes as he bows his head and trudges up the hill toward a grey stoned castle with lofty towers and a peaking roof that stretches high into the clouds. The man reels back to the woman. “Now, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.” She stands defiantly, holding her daughter in her arms as she steps back. “You aren’t taking her anywhere. She’s my daughter, not yours. You don’t own everything in this world.” “Bullshit I don’t.” He pauses and the woman continues to back away. “So it’s going to be the hard way, then.” He lunges at the woman and steals the little girl from her arms, even though the girl kicks and hits at him. The woman screams as she reaches her arms out toward her daughter, but the man draws out a knife from his pocket and she freezes. “You wouldn’t dare,” she whispers with her fists balled at her sides. “You need her too much.” The man aligns the sharp point of the knife closer to the girl’s neck. “Hurting her won’t make her useless, just scarred.” “Don’t hurt her,” the mother begs, clasping her hands in front of her. The girl hovers back from the knife. “Momma, help me.” Keeping a hold of the knife, the man reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a small black bag. “Or, if you want, I can use this?” He tips his head down at the girl. “Hey, sweetie, how would you like to go for a swim in the lake?” The girl shrinks back. “But I can’t swim.” “You’ll be fine,” the man coaxes as he begins to untie the bag. “Someone will be there to help you.” “Knock it off!” the mother screams and storms towards them. “She’s just a little girl. And—and if you put her there, then you can’t get her back.” The man laughs, throwing his head back, and shoves the woman back. “There are ways to get her back when I need her. She would probably be better off down there, anyway, until it’s time.” The woman stumbles, but quickly stands back up. “Please don’t do this. Please.” “Oh, I won’t; just as long as you get into the lake yourself,” the man says. “I’m giving you a choice. It’s either you or her.” I leap to my feet. Go in the lake! Why!? Was he going to try and drown her? Fighting down the vomit burning at the back of my throat, I walk towards them. “You’ll never get away with this.” Her voice is edging toward hysteria. “I know the real reason why you want her and, sooner or later, someone else is going to figure it out. You’ll never be able to get away with it.” “Oh, I highly doubt it. I have everyone wrapped around my little finger.” He sets the girl down on the ground, puts the knife out in front of him, and points his finger at the castle. “Go inside now.” She crosses her arms and elevates her chin. “I’m not leaving my mama.” “Go!” the man hollers and crows caw from the trees. The girl steps forward, getting closer to the man. “You are a very, very bad man.” The man targets the sharp side of the blade at her face. “You think so?” “Go on inside, sweetie,” her mother says and gestures her daughter to go. “It’s alright. Everything will be okay.” It takes the girl a second, but she finally lowers her arms, and heads toward the castle. My heart breaks for them, knowing somehow that it will be the last time they’ll see each other. The girl will grow up motherless. There will forever be an empty hole in her heart and all she’ll want is to feel love, but maybe it will never be possible because this moment will shatter her. There are so many similarities between the little girl and me, and I wonder if that’s why I’m seeing this vision. Am I going to meet the girl one day? Am I supposed to help her? “Now it’s time to deal with you.” The man lets a pause drag out as birds caw in the distances and circle above our heads “Get in the lake.” I shake my head. No. This can’t be happening. I don’t want to see this, yet, I can’t seem to stop running toward them. “You’ve been planning this all along, haven’t you?” Her voice quivers as she backs toward the shoreline and the man matches her every step. He has the knife in one hand and the bag in the other. “Every single word that’s come out of your mouth has been a lie.” “You know me well. Now quit stalling and get into the lake. Otherwise, I’ll have to force you in and that will make the situation unnecessarily painful.” “You’re wrong about not getting caught.” She reaches the brink of the lake and the waves roll against her ankles. “There are people who you don’t have wrapped around your finger.” “Then, I’ll have to take care of them as well.” He scoops out a handful of what looks like ash from the bag and then sprinkles it into the lake. It makes the water murky and still. “Don’t think you’ve won.” She holds her chin high and submerges her legs into the lake. “Someday, it will all catch up with you.” The water rises to her waist and the lake goes dead calm, like before a storm. The wind stalls and the birds become silent. It’s as if every part of nature knows something bad is going to happen. Like me. My legs fight to reach her, but I hear a swoosh and then the water splashes up. She plunges under the water, her arms flailing before they disappear. I let out a blood-curdling scream that ripples through the stillness. The man turns his back on the drowning woman and strolls away, whistling some funky tune that sounds like a mix between “It’s a Small World After All” and “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.” Without even thinking, I jump into the lake, forcing my legs against the pressure as the cold water ascends higher upon my body. When it reaches my chest, I freeze, suddenly remembering that I can’t swim. I’m about to backtrack when I feel a set of bony fingers wrap around my ankle and I’m jerked beneath the water. I gurgle as water floods my lungs and mouth. My legs and arms battle to find the surface, but the hand pulls me down into the ice-cold water and keeps dragging me deeper until I can’t hold my breath anymore. Chapter 15 I gasp for air as my eyes shoot open. The first thing I see is Alex’s worried face and then Laylen’s. I’m lying on the cold, tiled floor of Adessa’s store. My skin is dry and my lungs aren’t waterlogged. I can breathe again. I scramble to my feet and then grip the counter when the blood rushes to my head. “What the hell just happened?” “You touched the Foreseers’ ball after I told you not to.” Alex’s voice shakes slightly. “And you went into a vision just like I said you might.” “It was an accident… I was distracted by you trying to…” I trail off when I notice that Laylen is listening intently. “Whatever. It doesn’t matter.” I place my other hand on the counter, trying to control and bury all my emotions; but I can feel each one, like nails being inserted into my heart. He killed her. He made her drown and the girl was left in his hands. What did he do to her when he went back to the castle? “I can’t breathe,” I pant as my chest rises and falls violently. “Oh my God, I can’t… I can’t…” “Gemma, look at me.” Laylen’s voice envelops my body. I tip my chin up and meet his eyes, which look like deep pools of water. “If you want me to, I can calm you down.” He glances at Alex, checking. I look to my side and Alex steps into my line of vision. He examines my eyes and he must see something horrifying because he nods at Laylen. “Go ahead, but only this one time.” I turn back to Laylen and he nods, then places a hand on my shoulder. “Are you okay with it?” I’m not exactly sure what he’s going to do to me, but it has to be better than the invisible nails in my heart. “Go ahead. Please.” He rests his other hand on my other shoulder and then positions his body in front of me. He slides his hands up my neck, rests them on my cheeks and hunches over so he’s at eye level with me. “It’ll be just like on the porch, only… less sensual.” I swallow hard. “Okay.” He wets his lips with his tongue and shakes his head so his bangs are out of his eyes. “Now close your eyes.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-promises-shattered-promises-1/page-30.html","bookId":1976,"book":{"id":1976,"title":"Shattered Promises (Shattered Promises #1)","description":"Storyline: Shattered Promises (Shattered Promises #1) For twenty-one year-old Gemma, life has never been normal.
