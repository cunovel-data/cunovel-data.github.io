Alex starts to move forward with a vein popping out in his neck. “Which means I can do whatever I want with you.”\n I wiggle my arm enough that I can jab my elbow into his stomach. “Fuck you.”\n His stomach muscles tense. “Feisty. I like it,” he whispers in my ear and I slam my head straight into his nose.\n “Shit!” His hands leave my body and I dash over to Alex, meeting him in the middle of the room. He grabs my arms and swings me behind him. Prodding me with his elbow, he drives me toward the door as he reaches for his pocket.\n “I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” Nicholas calls out, still clutching his nose. There’s blood running down his arm and dripping onto his grey t-shirt.\n Alex pulls a small knife from his pocket and flips the blade open. “Gemma, go.”\n “Go and there will be even bigger consequences.” Nicholas pinches the brim of his bleeding nose. “And since you’re a Keeper and know all the laws and rules, I bet you can guess what they are.”\n “Foreseers can only punish Foreseers,” Alex states as he poises the knife out in front of him.\n He removes his hands from his nose and there’s blood all over his face. “Which is exactly what she is.”\n My jaw nearly slams to my knees. “Excuse me.”\n Alex turns his head and puts his finger to his lips, shushing me. “Listen, there’s been a misunderstanding.” He looks back at Nicholas. “Gemma, she’s… there are things about her that make her different, but she’s not a Foreseer.”\n He grabs a towel from off the hook and begins to dab the blood off his face. “Did she see a vision?”\n Alex wavers with his arm bent at the elbow and the knife stationed in front of him. “Yeah, but there were special circumstances.”\n “Look, I don’t give a shit what she is or what the circumstances are. You know the law and the law says if a person sees a vision, then they belong to the Foreseers.” He wipes his hands off with the towel and tosses it onto the counter. “Gemma saw a vision; therefore, she belongs to us and she’s going to the City of Crystal with me.”\n “I know what the fucking laws say,” Alex snaps. “But, like I said, she’s…”\n “Different.” Nicholas throws his head back and laughs. “It doesn’t matter. She has to go back with me. She can try and plead her case when she gets there, if she wants to.” His gaze drinks me in. “She can even wear the towel.”\n I pull a disgusted face, secure my hand onto the towel and then cower back behind Alex. “Can’t you make him go away?” I hiss.\n Alex shakes his head over and over again and then he pounds his fist against the countertop, causing perfume bottles to topple from the cabinet into the sink. He kicks the cupboard and punches a hole in the wall, breathing furiously and with deep, ravenous heaves of his lungs. After a long dragged out pause, he finally utters, “Fine, she’ll go.”\n “What!” I cry, jumping in front of him. “Are you kidding? I’m not going anywhere with him to some city with a bunch of future seeing weirdoes.”\n He sighs heavily and adjusts the towel higher up on my chest. “You don’t have a choice, Gemma. Laws are laws. If we break them, we’ll pay and you’ll still end up having to go down there.”\n I lock eyes with him and give him a silent plea. “Can’t you do something, like beat him up? Or, stab him with your knife?”\n Alex smashes his lips together like he’s trying not to laugh at me. “As much as I would love to do either, I can’t. Technically, he hasn’t done anything wrong.”\n “He was with the Death Walkers,” I argue. “And he’s been fucking with my head… he made me think I was going crazy.”\n Nicholas lurks towards us with a smirk. “Now, that wasn’t entirely me. Some of that stuff was conjured up from your own head. I was just trying to give your Foreseer ability a little nudge. You should be thanking me. Now that the gift’s starting to surface, the nightmares should stop.”\n “Can’t we just run?” I ask Alex, ignoring Nicholas.\n Alex shakes his head and offers me a look of compassion. “Foreseers can travel anywhere by the power of the crystal. If he wants to find us, he can and very quickly.”\n Nicholas starts to laugh as he reaches the edge of the counter. “We are brilliant creatures, aren’t we?”\n Alex rolls his eyes and slams his hand against Nicholas’s chest, shoving him back. Nicholas bumps his hip on the corner of the sink as he staggers backward, tripping over his feet. “Just so you know, I’m going with her,” Alex tells him.\n The humor vanishes from Nicholas’s face as he recovers his steadiness by bracing his hand on the wall. “You can’t go.”\n “There are no laws forbidding Keepers from entering the City of Crystal,” Alex informs him as he slides his pocketknife back into his pocket. “So I can go whether you like it or not.”\n It makes me feel a little bit better, but not much. I don’t want to be a Foreseer. I already have too much on my plate, and adding the ability to see futuristic visions is going to splinter it even more. “Are you sure there’s no other way?” I whisper to Alex, hoping.\n There’s definitiveness in his eyes. “I’m sorry, but don’t worry, I’ll make sure you come back with me. You won’t have to stay there.”\n Can I believe him? Can I trust him? What other choice do I have?\n He licks his lips as he stares at my mouth, and then increases his voice so Nicholas can hear. “The Keepers have much more weight than the Foreseers and, in the end, we all know how this is going to turn out.”\n Nicholas’s eyes smolder like embers as he glowers at Alex. “Nothing’s changed. You still do whatever the hell you want.”\n “Yep,” Alex replies coolly as he leans in and kisses my cheek possessively. “I absolutely fucking do. There’s no other way to live life.”\n “Whatever.” Nicholas retrieves a miniature crystal ball from the pocket of his cargo pants. It’s filled with red rubies and there’s a glittery tint to the glass. “Go head, my little Gem,” he says to me as he holds the ball. “Ladies first.”\n I glance at the towel barely covering my body. “You have to let me change first.”\n “Says who?” Nicholas questions and I want to slug him. “There’s no way I’m going to leave you alone. For all I know, you’ll jump out the window and run.”\n “And what?” I question. “Run out into the mountains and die?”\n He shrugs. “From what I’ve seen, you could be that stupid.”\n I shake my head and march forward with my hand beginning to elevate to hit him. Not just for this, but for everything else; for pretending to be Alex and making me think I’ve lost my mind.\n Alex gently touches my hand and it subdues me. “We’ll step out so you can dress, but hurry, okay?”\n “I didn’t agree to that.” Nicholas moves towards us, but Alex pushes him back again, and his shoulder slams into the wall as he fights to keep his footing.\n “You don’t need to be a fucking pervert,” Alex says in a firm voice. “Now, step out and let her change. She won’t go anywhere.”\n Nicholas studies me for an eternity, then his eyes dim to a deep brown as he winds a path around me. He squeezes between us and the towel rack, and heads to the doorway. “You have one minute.” He goes out into the hall and Alex follows, giving me a lingering last glance before he shuts the door.\n I hurry and pull on my jeans and a black t-shirt, then twist my hair up into a messy bun with a few bobby pins I find in a drawer.\n “Fifteen seconds,” Nicholas shouts from the other side of the door.\n Panicking, I glance at the window and consider jumping out and making a run for it. Maybe the risk of freezing to death is worth it? Before I can arrive at a definite decision the door swings open and the knob bangs against the wall.\n Nicholas struts inside with the crystal ball in the palm of his hand and Alex is just behind him. “Times up.”\n I really, really dislike this guy. “What exactly am I supposed to do with it?” I ask as I put my hands on my hips and stare at the crystal.\n “Put your hand on it,” he instructs as he elevates his arm so the crystal ball is closer to my face.\n I glance at Alex and he nods once. I summon a deep breath and tell myself I’m not afraid, that I’ve lived without fear forever and that this vile, toxic feeling intensifying in me really means I’m hungry. As my fingers brush the cold glass, there’s a burst of light and warmth that inundates my body. My body jolts forward as the sink, shower and mirror evaporate into light. A tunnel forms in front of my face and twists toward me. I try to back away, but I can’t tell what’s up and what’s down. I feel my limbs disconnect, but there is no pain, only soft tugs. I fall apart and collapse into a tunnel, unsure where I will end up.\n Chapter 18\n My limbs reconnect with my body as I crash against a glass floor and catch myself with my hands. I quickly push to my feet and my wrist lets out a loud pop. I wince as a sharp pain zips up my arm. I cradle my wrist and get to my feet. I’m standing in a field layered with grass that glistens like gemstones. Above, the sky is blue with sharp, distinct edges that resemble the cuts on a diamond. The clouds float back and forth, thin and wispy. At the end of the field is a godly throne perched on an immense silvery podium that’s trimmed with various shades and sizes of emeralds.\n “What the hell is this place?” I mutter.\n There’s a faint swoosh and then Alex drops down from above, landing gracefully beside me. His cheeks are wind kissed and his hair is disarranged. He quickly puts a finger up to his lips. “Shh... Keep quiet.”\n Another swoosh and Nicholas appears next to me. He smoothes the wrinkles from his cargo pants and ruffles his sandy hair back into place. “That was fun,” he remarks cleverly as he rubs his hands together. “It’s seriously the best part about being a Foreseer—falling into the unknown and not knowing where you’re going.”\n I shake my injured wrist until it pops back into place. “If you think that was fun, then I’d hate to hear what you think is torture.”\n “You, a four-post bed, and some leather straps,” he says with a wink. My jaw drops and he grins.\n “Can we just get this over with?” Alex rearranges his hair into place with a quick tousle from his fingers. “The quicker we get out of here, the better.”\n “What’s the rush?” Nicholas stuffs his hands into his pockets and rocks back on his heels. “They’re never going to let Gemma leave until she’s trained.” He winks at me again. “Which gives us a lot of time to get to know each other.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-promises-shattered-promises-1/page-36.html","bookId":1976,"book":{"id":1976,"title":"Shattered Promises (Shattered Promises #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Shattered Promises (Shattered Promises #1) \n For twenty-one year-old Gemma, life has never been normal.
