In little time at all, she\u0027d changed into a dark green gown and hurried downstairs by way of the main staircase. Sterns was now guarding the front door. The set of his jaw told her he was going to be difficult. \"You may not go outside,\" he announced in a voice that would have chilled a polar bear. She wasn\u0027t at all intimidated. She gave him a wide smile. \"I can and I will,\" she answered. \"My lord is most insistent that you remain inside.\" \"I\u0027m just as insistent that I go outside.\" In answer to that challenge, Sterns leaned against the door and slowly shook his head. Jade decided to turn his attention. \"Sterns? How many servants are there in residence here?\" He looked surprised by her question. \"We\u0027re only half staffed now,\" he answered. \"There are five of us in all.\" \"Where are the others?\" \"In London,\" he answered. \"They\u0027re helping to clean the town house.\" \"But I thought it was destroyed in the fire,\" she said. \"It wasn\u0027t as bad as all that,\" he said. \"The side\u0027s been boarded up and now there\u0027s only the smoke damage to be righted. While the workers repair the structure, the servants are cleaning the inside.\" \"I\u0027m wondering, Sterns, if the servants here can be trusted.\" He rose to his full height before answering. \"Mi\u0027lady, all the servants are trustworthy. They are all loyal to their employer.\" \"You\u0027re certain?\" He took a step away from the door. \"Why are you so interested in . . .\" \"You\u0027ll be having two guests in the next few days, Sterns, but no one must tell that they\u0027re here. Your staff must keep silent.\" \"The Marquess hasn\u0027t mentioned any guests to me,\" he argued, seeming mildly injured. Jade rushed past him and threw the door wide. \"Caine doesn\u0027t know about the visitors just yet,\" she said. \"That\u0027s the reason he hasn\u0027t told you. It\u0027s going to be a surprise, you see.\" She could tell from his befuddled expression that he didn\u0027t see. \"I just thought you\u0027d like to be forewarned so you could have the guest chambers made ready,\" she explained. She picked up her skirts and started down the steps. \"Now quit frowning, Sterns. I shall tell Caine you tried to keep me inside.\" \"And I shall inform mi\u0027lord that you weren\u0027t in your room,\" he called out. Jade found Caine going through the remains of what had been his stables. Only smoldering embers remained. The destruction was absolute. The horses, she noticed, were now housed in a large rectangular corral the men had just put together. Caine\u0027s white shirt was covered with soot. \"Have you collected all your horses?\" she asked when she reached his side. He slowly turned to look at her. The scowl on his face could very well start a fresh fire. His tone, however, was deceptively mild when he said, \"All but the one you borrowed.\" \"Borrowed?\" she asked, feigning innocence. \"Go and wait for me in the drawing room,\" he commanded. \"But Caine, I want to help.\" \"Help?\" He almost lost his temper then and there. \"You and your men have helped enough.\" Several deep breaths later, he said, \"Go back inside. Now.\" His roar accomplished his goal. Jade immediately turned around and hurried back to the house. She could feel Caine\u0027s stare on her back and wouldn\u0027t have been surprised if her gown had caught fire. The man was spitting-embers angry. It would be pointless to try to reason with him now. She\u0027d have to wait until his anger had dissipated just a little. When she reached the bottom step, she turned back to him. \"Caine? If you must stay outside, don\u0027t be such a bloody easy target.\" Sterns rushed down the stairs, grabbed hold of her elbow, and whispered, \"Do as he orders, Lady Jade. You don\u0027t want to prod his temper now. Come along inside now,\" he added as he assisted her up the stairs. \"I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve ever seen mi\u0027lord in such a rage.\" \"Yes, he is in a rage,\" Jade whispered, irritated by the tremor in her voice. \"Sterns, do you think I might have a cup of tea? This day seems to have gone completely sour,\" she added. \"And it\u0027s not even half done.\" \"Of course I shall fix you some tea,\" Sterns rushed out. \"Mi\u0027lady, I\u0027m certain the Marquess didn\u0027t mean to raise his voice to you. Once he gets over his anger, I\u0027m certain he\u0027ll apologize.\" \"He might not ever get over his anger,\" she muttered. Sterns opened the front door for her, then followed her inside. \"The stables weren\u0027t even a month old,\" he said. Jade tried to pay attention to what Sterns was saying, but Caine\u0027s words kept echoing through her mind. You and your men have helped enough. Yes, those were his very words. He knew about Matthew and Jimbo. But how? she wondered, and more importantly, what else did he know? While Sterns went to see about her tea, Jade paced the confines of the large drawing room. She opened the pair of French doors at the end of the room to let in the fresh spring air. It was a precautionary measure as well, for if Caine was bent on killing her, she\u0027d have a possible escape. \"Nonsense,\" she muttered as she resumed her pacing. Caine would never raise his hand against her, no matter how angry he became. Besides, he couldn\u0027t possibly know the full truth. The front door suddenly bounded open. It banged against the interior wall twice before it was slammed shut. Caine had arrived. Jade rushed over to the gold brocade settee, sat down, and folded her hands in her lap. She forced a serene smile on her face. He wasn\u0027t going to know she was shaking. No, she\u0027d go to her grave before she\u0027d let him know he had her worried. The doors to the drawing room flew open next. Caine filled the entrance. Jade couldn\u0027t hold her smile once she saw his expression. He looked ready to kill. Why, he was so furious, he was actually trembling. \"Where did you go this morning?\" he roared. \"Don\u0027t take that tone of voice with me, sir. You\u0027ll make me deaf.\" \"Answer me.\" She glared at him because he\u0027d ignored her order and had shouted once again, then said, \"I went to visit your dear papa.\" That announcement took a little of the bluster out of him. Then he shook his head. \"I don\u0027t believe you.\" \"I\u0027m telling you the truth,\" she stated. Caine walked into the room and didn\u0027t stop until he towered over her. The tips of his boots touched the hem of her gown. He loomed over her like an avenging god. Jade felt trapped. In the back of her mind she knew that he wanted her to feel that way. \"I\u0027m sorry you don\u0027t believe me, Caine, but I did go to see your father. I was very concerned about him, you see. Sir Harwick mentioned he wasn\u0027t feeling well and I thought a nice chat would lighten his mood.\" She stared down at her hands while she made that confession. \"When did you set the fire. Jade?\" She looked up at his face then. \"I didn\u0027t set any fires,\" she announced. \"The hell you didn\u0027t,\" he roared. He turned away from her and walked over to the hearth. He was so furious, he didn\u0027t trust himself to stand close to her. She stood up, folded her hands in front of her, and said, \"I didn\u0027t set your stables on fire, Caine.\" \"Then you ordered one of your men to do it. Now I want to know why.\" \"What men?\" \"The two bastards who\u0027ve been hanging around here since the day we arrived,\" he answered. He waited to hear her denial. She had given him nothing but lies since the moment they met. He realized that now. \"Oh, those two men,\" she answered. She lifted her shoulders in a delicate shrug. \"You must mean Matthew and Jimbo. You\u0027ve met them, have you?\" His anguish was almost unbearable now. \"Yes, I\u0027ve met them. They were two more lies, weren\u0027t they?\" She couldn\u0027t look at him now. God help her, she was finally seeing the man she\u0027d read about in the file. Cold. Methodical. Deadly. The descriptive words hadn\u0027t been exaggerated after all. \"Matthew and Jimbo are fine men,\" she whispered. \"Then you don\u0027t deny . . .\" \"I won\u0027t deny anything,\" she answered. \"You\u0027re putting me in an impossible position. I have given my word and I can\u0027t break it. You\u0027ll just have to trust me a while longer.\" \"Trust you?\" He roared the words like blasphemies. \"I will never trust you again. You must think I\u0027m a fool if you believe I would.\" She was terrified of him now. She took a deep breath, then said, \"My problem is very delicate.\" \"I don\u0027t give a damn how delicate your problem is,\" he roared. \"What in God\u0027s name is your game? Why are you here?\" He was back to shouting at her. Jade shook her head at him. \"I will tell you only that I\u0027m here because of you.\" \"Answer me.\" \"Very well,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027m here to protect you.\" She might as well have told him she\u0027d come from the heavens for all the attention he gave that statement of fact. \"I want the real reason, damn it.\" \"That is the real reason. I\u0027m protecting you.\" Sterns appeared at the opened doorway with a silver tray in his hands. He took one look at his employer\u0027s face and immediately turned around. \"Shut the doors behind you, Sterns,\" Caine ordered. \"Don\u0027t you raise your voice to Sterns,\" Jade demanded in a near shout of her own. \"He has nothing to do with this and you shouldn\u0027t take your anger out on him.\" \"Sit down, Jade.\" His voice was much softer now, far more threatening, too. It took all Jade\u0027s determination not to do as he ordered. \"You probably kick puppies when you\u0027re in a foul mood, don\u0027t you?\" \"Sit down.\" She glanced over to the doorway, judging the distance to safety, but Caine\u0027s next words changed her mind. \"You wouldn\u0027t make it.\" Jade turned back to Caine. \"You aren\u0027t going to be at all reasonable about this, are you?\" \"No,\" he answered. \"I\u0027m not going to be reasonable.\" \"I was hoping that we could have a quiet discussion after you\u0027ve calmed down and . . .\" \"Now,\" he countered. \"We\u0027re going to have our discussion now, Jade.\" He wanted to grab hold of her, shake her into answering all his questions, but he knew if he touched her, he might kill her. His heart felt as though it had just been torn in half. \"Pagan sent you, didn\u0027t he?\" \"No.\" \"Yes,\" he answered. \"My God, the bastard sent a woman to do his work for him. Who is he, Jade? Your brother?\" She shook her head and backed away from him. \"Caine, please try to listen . ..\" He started after her, then forced himself to stop. \"All of it... lies, isn\u0027t that right, Jade? You weren\u0027t in any danger.\" \"Not all of it lies,\" she answered. \"But you were the primary target.\" He shook his head. She knew then he wasn\u0027t going to believe anything she told him. She could see the pain, the raw agony in his eyes. \"He sent a woman,\" he repeated. \"Your brother\u0027s a coward. He\u0027s going to die. It will be fitting justice, won\u0027t it? An eye for an eye, or in this instance, a brother for a brother.\" \"Caine, you must listen to me,\" she cried out. She wanted to weep because of the torment she was causing him. \"You have to understand. In the beginning, I didn\u0027t know what kind of a man you were . . . Oh, God, I\u0027m so sorry . . .\" \"Sorry?\" he asked, his voice flat, devoid of all emotion. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"If you\u0027ll only listen . . .\" \"Do you think I\u0027m going to believe anything you tell me now?\" Jade didn\u0027t answer him. Caine seemed to be staring through her. He didn\u0027t say anything for a long time. She could almost see the fury building inside of him. She closed her eyes against his dark expression, his anger, his hatred. \"Did you let me make love to you because Pagan ordered you to?\" he asked. She reacted as though he\u0027d just struck her. \"That would make me a whore, Caine, and I don\u0027t whore for anyone, not even my brother.\" He didn\u0027t agree with her soon enough to placate her. Her eyes filled with tears. \"I am not a whore,\" she shouted. The sudden roar that came from the French doors turned both Caine\u0027s and Jade\u0027s attention. The bone-chilling sound was like a battle cry. Jade recognized the sound. Nathan had arrived. The deception was finally over. \"Did you just call my sister a whore?\" The walls shook from the venom in Nathan\u0027s deep voice. Jade had never seen her brother so angry. She took a step toward her brother, but suddenly found herself hauled up against Caine\u0027s side. \"Don\u0027t get in my way,\" he ordered, his voice mild, horribly calm. \"In the way of what?\" she asked. \"You aren\u0027t going to hurt my brother, Caine. I won\u0027t let you.\" \"Get your hands off her,\" Nathan roared. \"Or I\u0027ll kill you.\" \"Nathan,\" Jade cried out. \"Caine doesn\u0027t understand.\" She tried to push Caine\u0027s hands away from her shoulders. It proved impossible. His grip was as tenacious as seaweed. She didn\u0027t know who looked more furious. Nathan\u0027s scowl was just as ugly as Caine\u0027s was, just as threatening. They were equally matched, these two giant adversaries. They were bound to kill each other if given the chance. Nathan looked like a pirate, too. His long, dark brown hair fell way past his broad shoulders. He was dressed in snug black britches and wore his white shirt opened almost to the waist. Nathan wasn\u0027t quite as tall as Caine was, but he was certainly just as muscular. Yes, they would kill each other. Jade frantically tried to think of a way to ease the situation while the two men took each other\u0027s measure. \"I asked you a question, you bastard,\" Nathan shouted again. He took a threatening step forward. \"Did you call my sister a whore?\" \"He didn\u0027t call me a whore,\" Jade shouted when Nathan reached for the knife in his waistband. \"He doesn\u0027t know about Colin. I kept my word not to tell him.\" Nathan hesitated. Jade pressed her advantage. \"He thinks you killed Colin. He has it all figured out, Nathan.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-23.html","bookId":1791,"book":{"id":1791,"title":"Guardian Angel (Crown\u0027s Spies #2)","description":"Storyline: The Emerald flew across the seas, carrying the pirate Pagan -- despised by the ton, whose riches he plundered, and beloved by the poor, whose plight was eased by his gifts.
