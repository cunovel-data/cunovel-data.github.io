{"id":78822,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"\"And what might that truth be?\" Caine asked. \"That he\u0027s actually a little civilized after all?\" \"How did you guess?\" \"From the way you turned out,\" he explained. \"If he was such a barbarian, you wouldn\u0027t have become such a lady.\" She beamed with pleasure. \"It is good of you to notice,\" she whispered. \"Uncle is very intelligent.\" \"He\u0027s the one who taught you how to read, isn\u0027t he?\" She nodded. \"It proved fortunate, too, for his eyes started failing him. At night I would read to him.\" \"From memory?\" \"Only when there weren\u0027t any books available. Harry stole as many as he could get his hands on.\" \"The way he speaks,\" Caine interjected. \"That\u0027s all part of his deception, too, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes,\" she admitted. \"Appearances, after all. He doesn\u0027t even use proper grammar when we\u0027re alone, fearing he\u0027ll slip up in front of his men, you see.\" Caine rolled his eyes. \"Your uncle became a bit of a fanatic about his position as leader, didn\u0027t he?\" \"No,\" she argued. \"You misunderstand. He enjoys the deception, Caine.\" She continued to talk about her uncle for another few minutes, then turned the topic to some of her most memorable escapades. Because he\u0027d promised not to get angry, Caine hid his reaction. His hands were shaking, though, with the true need to wring good old Uncle Harry\u0027s neck, by the time she\u0027d finished telling him about one particularly harrowing incident. He decided he didn\u0027t want to know all about her past after all. \"I think I\u0027d better hear these stories one at a time.\" \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m doing,\" she countered. She paused to smile at the servant when the woman placed a tray of crusty rolls in front of her, then turned back to Caine. \"I am telling them one at a time.\" Caine shook his head. \"I mean I want you to tell me one every other month or so. A man can only take so much. I promise you I\u0027ll be thinking about the story you just told me a good long while. Hell, Jade, I can feel my hair turning gray. You could have been killed. You could have . . .\" \"But you aren\u0027t getting angry,\" she interjected with a smile. \"You did promise.\" Caine leaned back in his chair. \"I think we\u0027d better change the subject. Tell me when you realized you love me,\" he commanded. \"Did I force you?\" She started to laugh. \"You can\u0027t force someone to love you,\" she said. \"I believe, however, that when I read your file, I was already falling in love with you.\" She smiled over the astonished look on his face. \"It\u0027s true,\" she whispered. \"Jade, I\u0027m not very proud of some of the things I had to do,\" he said. \"You did read the entire file, didn\u0027t you?\" \"I did,\" she answered. \"You were determined, methodical too, but you weren\u0027t inhuman about it. In every accounting, you were always so ... reliable. People depended upon you and you never let them down. I admired that quality, of course. And then I met you,\" she ended. \"You were a little like McKindry, because you snuck up behind me and stole my heart before I even realized what was happening. Now you must tell me when you realized you loved me.\" \"It was during one of our many heated debates,\" he said. It was her turn to look astonished. \"We never debated,\" she said. \"We shouted at each other. Those were arguments.\" \"Debates,\" he repeated. \"Loud ones but debates all the same.\" \"Are you telling me you fell in love with my mind first?\" \"No.\" She laughed, delighted by his honesty. \"Shouldn\u0027t your man be here with us? It might look suspicious if he stays in the country, Caine.\" \"Sterns never comes to London with me,\" he explained. \"Everyone knows that. Sterns hates London, says it\u0027s too cluttered.\" \"I miss him,\" she admitted. \"He reminds me of you. Sterns is most opinionated鈥攁rrogant, too.\" \"No one understands why I put up with him,\" Caine said. \"But if the truth were out, I don\u0027t understand why he puts up with me. He\u0027s been like a shield to me, especially when I was a lad. I did get into quite a bit of mischief. Sterns softened the telling, though. He pulled me out of certain death several times, too.\" Caine told her a story about the time he almost drowned in a boating incident and how Sterns had saved him only to toss him right back in the waters to learn the proper way to swim. Both of them were laughing by the time Caine ended the tale, for the picture of the sour-faced butler in full clothing swimming alongside his small charge was quite amusing. Jade was the first to grow somber. \"Caine, did you and your friends come to any conclusions last night after I went to bed?\" \"The man Richards followed home was Willburn. Do you remember Colin told us that Willburn was his director and how he confided in him?\" \"Yes, I remember,\" she replied. \"Nathan said he never trusted Willburn. Still, my brother doesn\u0027t trust anyone but Harry and Colin, and me, of course.\" \"Colin was wrong, Jade. Willburn did work for the Tribunal. He\u0027s now employed by the one remaining member.\" Before she could interrupt him, he continued. \"We\u0027re pretty certain William Terrance was the second man. Since he\u0027s dead, and your father too, that only leaves the third. Richards is convinced Terrance was called Prince. That leaves Ice unaccounted for.\" \"How will we ever find Ice? We really don\u0027t have much to go on. The letters were very sparse with personal information, Caine.\" \"Sure we do, sweetheart,\" he replied. \"In one of the letters, there was mention that Ice didn\u0027t attend Oxford. Also, both Fox and Prince were surprised when they met Ice.\" \"How did you gather that bit of information?\" \"From one of the remarks made by your father to Prince in the third ... no, the fourth letter.\" \"I remember,\" she countered. \"I just didn\u0027t think it significant.\" \"Richards believes Ice could very well be a foreigner.\" \"And you?\" she asked. \"I\u0027m not convinced. There are other important clues in those letters, Jade. I just need a little more time to put them all together.\" She had complete faith in his ability to sort it all out. Once Caine put his mind to a problem, he would be able to solve it. \"Richards put a watch on Willburn. He thinks he might lead us to Ice. It\u0027s a start, but I\u0027m not putting my money on it. We have other options, too. Now, sweetheart, I don\u0027t want you to leave this town house, no matter what the reason, all right?\" \"You can\u0027t leave either,\" she returned. \"Agreed?\" \"Agreed.\" \"Whatever will we do to keep ourselves occupied?\" she asked with as much innocence in her tone as she could manage. \"We could do a lot of reading, I suppose,\" he drawled out. She stood up and went to stand behind his back. \"Yes, we could read,\" she whispered as she wrapped her arms around his broad shoulders. Her fingers slipped inside the top of his shirt. \"I could learn how to embroider,\" she added. \"I\u0027ve always wanted to learn that task.\" She leaned down and nibbled on his earlobe. \"But do you know what I want to do most of all, husband?\" \"I\u0027m getting a fair idea,\" he answered, his voice husky with arousal. \"You know? Then you\u0027ll teach me?\" \"Everything I know, sweetheart,\" he promised. He stood up and took her into his arms. \"What will we do for music?\" she asked. If he thought that an odd question, he didn\u0027t say so. \"We\u0027ll make our own music,\" he promised. He dragged her by the hand into the foyer and started up the steps. \"How?\" she asked, laughing. \"I\u0027ll hum every time you moan,\" he explained. \"Don\u0027t you think the drawing room will be better?\" she asked. \"The bed would be more comfortable,\" he answered. \"But if you\u0027re determined to . . .\" \"Learn how to dance,\" she interjected. \"That is what this discussion is all about, isn\u0027t it?\" She smiled ever so sweetly up at him after telling that lie, waiting for his reaction. She thought she\u0027d bested him with her trickery. Caine, however, proved to be far more cunning than she was, more creative, too. He followed her into the drawing room, locked the doors behind him, and then proceeded to teach her how to dance. It was a pity, but she was never going to be able to show off her new skill in public, for Caine and she would scandalize the ton with the erotic, absolutely sinful way he taught her how to dance. And though he was thoroughly logical in his explanation, she still refused to believe the ladies and gentlemen of the ton took their clothes off before they did the waltz. Caine kept her entertained the rest of the day, but as soon as darkness fell, they had their first argument. \"What do you mean, you\u0027re leaving?\" she cried when he put his jacket on. \"We agreed that we wouldn\u0027t leave this town house . . .\" \"I\u0027ll be careful,\" Caine interrupted. He kissed her on her forehead. \"Lyon and Richards are waiting for me, sweet. I\u0027m going to have to go out every night, I\u0027m afraid, until we finish this. Now quit worrying and tell me you won\u0027t wait up for me.\" \"I will wait up for you,\" she stammered out. \"I know,\" he answered with a sigh. \"But tell me you won\u0027t anyway.\" She let him see her exasperation. \"Caine, if anything happens to you, I\u0027m going to be very angry.\" \"I\u0027ll be careful,\" he answered. Jade chased after him to the back door. \"You\u0027ll remember McKindry?\" He turned, his hand on the doorknob. \"That\u0027s your lesson, sweetheart.\" \"Well, you can damned well learn from it, too,\" she muttered. \"All right,\" he answered, trying to placate her. \"I\u0027ll remember McKindry.\" He turned and opened the door. \"Jade?\" \"Yes?\" \"You will be here when I come home, won\u0027t you?\" She was amazed by his question, insulted, too, and she would have blistered him with a piece of her mind if he hadn\u0027t sounded so vulnerable. \"Have I made you so insecure, then?\" she asked instead. \"Answer me,\" he commanded. \"I\u0027ll be here when you come home.\" Those parting words became their ritual. Each night, just as he was leaving, he would tell her he would remember McKindry, and she would tell him she would be waiting for him. During the dark hours of the night, while she waited for her husband to come home to her, she thought about his vulnerability. At first, she believed she was the cause. After all, she\u0027d let him see her own insecurity often enough. But she sensed, too, that Caine\u0027s background was another reason for his own vulnerability. She couldn\u0027t imagine what his early life must have been like. Sir Harwick had called Caine\u0027s mother a shrew. She remembered he\u0027d also said that the woman had tried to turn her son against his father. It couldn\u0027t have been a peaceful time for Caine. The more she thought about it, the more convinced she became that Caine actually needed her just as much as she needed him. That realization was a comfort. Lady Briars sent several notes inviting Jade to visit. Caine wouldn\u0027t let her leave the town house, however, and sent word back that his wife was indisposed. In the end, her father\u0027s dear friend came to see her. Jade\u0027s memory of the woman was hazy at best, but she felt horribly guilty about pretending to be ill when she saw how old and frail the woman was. She was still beautiful, though, with clear blue eyes and silvery gray hair. Her intellect appeared to be quite sharp, too. Jade served tea in the drawing room, then took her place next to Caine on the settee. He seemed quite determined to participate in the women\u0027s conversation. Both husband and wife listened to Lady Briars extend her condolences over Nathan\u0027s tragic death. Jade played the role of grieving sister well, but she hated the deception, for Lady Briars was so sincere in her sympathy. \"When I read about the tragedy in the papers, I was stunned,\" Lady Briars said. \"I had no idea Nathan worked for the government doing such secretive work. Caine, I must tell you how sorry I was to hear your brother was also killed by that horrid pirate. I didn\u0027t know the lad, of course, but I\u0027m certain he must have had a heart of gold.\" \"I never met Colin either,\" Jade interjected. \"But Caine has told me all about him. He was a good man, Lady Briars, and he died for his country.\" \"How did Pagan become involved in this?\" Lady Briars asked. \"I\u0027m still hazy on the details, child.\" Caine answered her question. \"From what the War Department was able to piece together, Nathan and Colin were waylaid when en route to investigate a highly secretive matter.\" \"Isn\u0027t it rather ironic that you two ended up together?\" Lady Briars asked. There was a smile in her voice now. \"Not really,\" Caine answered. \"Both of us missed the ceremony honoring our brothers,\" he explained. \"Jade came to see me. She wanted to talk about Nathan and I guess I needed to talk about Colin. We were immediately drawn to each other.\" He paused to wink at Jade, then continued, \"I believe it was love at first sight.\" \"I can see why,\" Lady Briars said. \"Jade, you\u0027ve turned into a beautiful woman.\" She shook her head and let out a little sigh. \"I never understood why your father\u0027s friend snatched you away so quickly after your father\u0027s funeral. I will admit I was going to petition the Crown for guardianship. I\u0027d always wanted a daughter. I also believed you would have fared much better with me. Now, after visiting with you, well, I must concede that you were properly raised.\" \"Uncle Harry insisted we leave right away,\" Jade explained. \"He wasn\u0027t our legal guardian and he knew you\u0027d fight for Nathan and me.\" \"Yes,\" Lady Briars agreed. \"Do you know, I feel in part responsible for Nathan\u0027s death. Yes, I do. If he\u0027d come to live with me, I certainly wouldn\u0027t have allowed him to go off on those sea voyages. It was too dangerous.\" \"Nathan was a fully grown man when he made his decision to work for England,\" Caine interjected. \"I doubt you could have kept him home, Lady Briars.\" \"Still,\" she countered. \"I still don\u0027t understand why your father didn\u0027t consider me for guardianship . . .\" \"I believe I understand,\" Jade said. \"Harry told me that Father had turned his heart against England.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-42.html","bookId":1791,"book":{"id":1791,"title":"Guardian Angel (Crown\u0027s Spies #2)","description":"Storyline: The Emerald flew across the seas, carrying the pirate Pagan -- despised by the ton, whose riches he plundered, and beloved by the poor, whose plight was eased by his gifts.
