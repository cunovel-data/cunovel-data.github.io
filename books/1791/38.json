He leaned back in his chair and smiled at his butler. \"You\u0027ve done well, Sterns. I commend you.\"\\n\\n \"Of course I\u0027ve done well,\" Sterns agreed. \"I\u0027ve seen to everything,\" he boasted.\\n\\n \"Oh?\" Nathan asked. \"Then tell us how Caine\u0027s going to convince Jade?\"\\n\\n In answer to that question, Sterns removed the empty pistol he\u0027d concealed in his waistband. He dropped the weapon in the center of the table.\\n\\n Everyone stared at the pistol until Sterns broke the silence again. He addressed his remarks to Richards.\\n\\n \"I believe I overheard you suggesting the pistol be aimed at Lady Jade\u0027s shoulders, or was I mistaken?\"\\n\\n The laughter was deafening. Jade stood at the door, the urn in her hands while she waited for the men to calm down.\\n\\n She then poured Sterns his tea, put the urn on the sideboard, and returned to her seat. She noticed the pistol in the center of the table, but when she asked what it was doing there, she couldn\u0027t get a decent answer. The men had all started laughing again.\\n\\n No one would explain. Jade guessed someone had told a bawdy jest and they were too embarrassed to share it with her.\\n\\n Jade was ready to return to their plans. Caine surprised her by suggesting she return to her room.\\n\\n \"Why?\" she asked. \"I thought we were going . . .\"\\n\\n \"You need to pack your things,\" Caine said.\\n\\n Jade nodded. \"You just want to tell more of your jests,\" she announced before she took her leave.\\n\\n They were all smiling at her like happy thieves looking over their booty. She didn\u0027t know what to make\\n\\n of that. The two guards were waiting for her in the foyer. They helped her carry the gowns Sterns had placed in Caine\u0027s wardrobe down to her chambers, then waited outside in the hall while she packed.\\n\\n When she was finished with her task, she sat down by the window and began reading the book she\u0027d only half finished two nights ago.\\n\\n A short time later, there was a timid knock on the door. Jade closed her book and stood up just as Black Harry came into the room.\\n\\n She was clearly astonished to see him. Her uncle was carrying a dozen long-stemmed white roses.\\n\\n \"These are for you, girl,\" he announced as he shoved the bouquet into her arms.\\n\\n \"Thank you, Uncle,\" she replied. \"But what are you doing here? I thought you were going to wait for me at the cottage?\"\\n\\n Harry kissed her on the top of her head. \"You look fit, Pagan,\" he muttered, completely ignoring her question. \"Caine should be wearing my clothes this proud day.\"\\n\\n \"Why should Caine wear your clothes?\" she asked, thoroughly confused now. She\u0027d never seen her uncle act so nervous. He looked terribly worried, too.\\n\\n \"Because my shirt is the very color of your pretty gown,\" Harry explained.\\n\\n \"But what does . . .\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be telling it in my own good time,\" Harry blurted out. He hugged her close, squishing the flowers in the process, then stepped back. \"Caine asked me if he could wed you, girl.\"\\n\\n Harry took another precautionary step back after making his announcement, fully expecting an explosion. He got a dainty shrug instead. He noticed, though, that she was gripping the flowers tightly. \"Watch for thorns, girl,\" he ordered.\\n\\n \"What did you tell him, Uncle?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"He asked me real proper,\" Harry rushed out. \"I could have had him down on one knee,\" he added with a nod. \"He said he would, if it be needed to win my permission. He said it loud and clear right in front of me men, he did.\"\\n\\n \"But what did you tell him?\" she asked again.\\n\\n \"I said yes.\"\\n\\n He took another hasty step back after telling her that. She shrugged again, then walked over to the side of the bed and sat down. She put the bouquet of roses on the coverlet beside her.\\n\\n \"Why aren\u0027t you getting your temper up, girl?\" Harry asked. He rubbed his jaw while he studied her. \"Caine said you might be resistant to the notion. Ain\u0027t you angry?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Then what is it?\" he demanded. He clasped his hands behind his back while he tried to guess her reasons. \"You care for this man, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I do.\"\\n\\n \"Well then?\" he prodded.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid, Uncle.\"\\n\\n Her voice had been a bare whisper. Harry heard her but was so astonished by her admission, he didn\u0027t know what to say. \"You\u0027re not,\" he stammered.\\n\\n \"I am.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"You ain\u0027t never been afraid of anything before.\" His voice was gruff with affection. He went to the bed, sat down beside her on top of the flowers, and awkwardly put his arm around her shoulders. \"What\u0027s different now?\"\\n\\n Oh, yes, she wanted to shout, I\u0027ve been afraid before . . . so many times, so many near mishaps, she\u0027d lost count. She couldn\u0027t tell him, of course, for if she did, he\u0027d think he\u0027d failed her.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s different because I\u0027ll have to give up my work,\" she said instead.\\n\\n \"You know it\u0027s time, what with me retiring and all,\" he countered. \"I\u0027ve hid it from me men, girl, but my eyes, well, I ain\u0027t seeing as proper as I used to. They\u0027ll balk at following a blind pirate.\"\\n\\n \"Then who will they follow?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Nathan.\"\\n\\n \"Nathan?\"\\n\\n \"He wants the Emerald. It belonged to his father, after all, and he has that little business to take care of. He\u0027ll make a fine pirate, girl. He\u0027s learned how to be real mean.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, he would make a good pirate,\" she admitted. \"But Uncle Harry, I can\u0027t be the kind of woman\\n\\n Caine wants.\"\\n\\n \"You are the woman he wants.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll make so many mistakes,\" she whispered. She was on the verge of tears and was valiantly trying to keep her emotions controlled for Harry\u0027s sake. \"I don\u0027t know how to do all the things a proper wife should know how to do. I\u0027m no good with a needle, Harry.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, you\u0027re not,\" Harry admitted bleakly, remembering the time she tried to mend his sock and stitched it to her gown.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t dance,\" she added. She looked so forlorn when she\u0027d made that confession, Harry threw his arm around her shoulder and hugged her. \"All the fine ladies of the ton know how to dance,\" she ended on a wail.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll learn,\" Harry predicted. \"If you want to learn.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" she admitted in a rush. \"I\u0027ve always wanted ...\"\\n\\n Now she sounded wistful. Harry didn\u0027t know what was going on inside her mind. \"What?\" he asked. \"What have you always wanted?\"\\n\\n \"To belong.\"\\n\\n The look on his face indicated he didn\u0027t understand what she was talking about.\\n\\n \"Are you wishing now I\u0027d given you to Lady Briars? She would have taken you, girl. Why, she fought me something fierce for you, too. She\u0027s the reason we snuck off real quiet-like right after your father\u0027s funeral. I guessed she\u0027d come back with the authorities and try and steal you away from me. I weren\u0027t your legal guardian, if you\u0027ll remember. Still, your papa wanted you to get away from England.\"\\n\\n \"You kept your word to my father,\" she interjected. \"You were very honorable.\"\\n\\n \"But are you wishing now I wasn\u0027t so honorable back then?\"\\n\\n She shook her head. For the first time in all their days together, she was seeing Harry\u0027s vulnerability. \"I cannot imagine my life without you, Harry. I would never wish that things had been different. You loved me as though I were your very own daughter.\"\\n\\n Harry\u0027s arm dropped to his side. He looked dejected. She put her arm around his shoulders, trying now to comfort him. \"Uncle, Lady Briars would have taught me all the rules, yes, but she couldn\u0027t have loved me the way you did. Besides, you taught me far more important rules. You taught me how to survive.\"\\n\\n Harry was quick to perk up. \"I did,\" he admitted with a grin. \"You had the makings though. I\u0027ve never seen such a natural thief or a born liar in all my days. I\u0027m right proud of you, girl.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Uncle,\" she replied, blushing over his praise. Harry wasn\u0027t one to give idle compliments and she knew he spoke from his heart.\\n\\n His expression soured, however, when he returned to her initial remark. \"Yet you didn\u0027t think you belonged? You did say you wanted to belong, girl.\"\\n\\n \"I meant to be a proper wife,\" she lied. \"That\u0027s what I meant by belonging now.\"\\n\\n \"You weren\u0027t speaking plain enough, girl,\" Harry announced. He looked relieved. \"As for me, I\u0027ve always wanted to be a grandpapa.\"\\n\\n She started to blush. \"I don\u0027t know how to have babies either,\" she wailed.\\n\\n Harry had meant to lighten her mood. He realized he\u0027d taken the wrong approach. \"Hell, no woman knows how until the time comes, girl. Tell me this. Do you love Caine? He says you do.\"\\n\\n She skirted his question. \"What if he gets tired of me? He\u0027ll leave me then, Harry,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"I know he will.\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"He needs time to realize . . .\" She paused in midsentence. \"That\u0027s it, Harry. If the courtship is long enough, perhaps he\u0027ll realize he\u0027s made a mistake.\" She smiled then. \"And during that time, in case he isn\u0027t making a mistake, I could try to learn all that would be required of me. Yes, Uncle, that\u0027s it. Caine\u0027s being very honorable now, trying to do the right thing . . .\"\\n\\n \"Well, now, girl,\" Harry interrupted. \"About this lengthy courtship plan . . .\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Harry, that is the only answer,\" she interrupted. \"I\u0027ll insist on a year. I\u0027ll wager he\u0027ll agree right off.\"\\n\\n She was so pleased with her decision, she rushed out of the room. Harry adjusted his ill-fitting spectacles on the bridge of his nose, grabbed the bouquet and tucked it under his arm, and chased after her.\\n\\n \"Wait up,\" he bellowed.\\n\\n \"I must talk to Caine at once,\" she called over her shoulder. \"I\u0027m certain he\u0027s going to agree.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just as certain he ain\u0027t going to agree,\" Harry muttered. \"Girl, hold fast. There\u0027s still a bit of the telling I have to do.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d already reached the foyer by the time Harry reached the landing above. \"They\u0027re in the drawing room,\" her uncle shouted as he lumbered down the stairs.\\n\\n Jade came to an abrupt stop when she opened the doors and saw the gathering. Harry caught up with\\n\\n her and forced her hand on his arm. \"We\u0027re doing this proper, girl,\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"Why are all these people here?\" she asked. She looked at the group, recognized everyone but the short, partially bald-headed man standing by the French doors. He held a book in his hand and was in deep conversation with the Duke and Duchess of Williamshire.\\n\\n Caine was standing by the hearth, talking to Lyon. He must have sensed her presence, for he suddenly turned in midsentence and looked at her.\\n\\n His expression was solemn.\\n\\n He knew at once by her puzzled expression she didn\u0027t understand what was going on. Caine braced himself for the fireworks he was sure were about to erupt, then walked over to face Jade.\\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t had time to finish explaining,\" Harry said.\\n\\n \"I can see you haven\u0027t,\" Caine interjected. \"Jade, sweet, we\u0027re going . . .\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be telling it,\" Harry insisted.\\n\\n He clasped Jade\u0027s hand flat on his arm so her nails wouldn\u0027t do injury, then said, \"There ain\u0027t going to be a year\u0027s courtship, girl.\"\\n\\n She continued to stare up at him with that innocent, angelic gaze. Harry tightened his hold on her hand. \"But there\u0027s going to be a wedding.\"\\n\\n She was beginning to understand, Harry guessed, when he noticed her eyes were turning the color of emeralds again.\\n\\n She was trying to tug her hand away. Harry held tight. \"When is this wedding?\" she asked in a hoarse whisper.\\n\\n Harry grimaced before answering. \"Now.\"\\n\\n She opened her mouth to shout her denial, but Caine moved closer, blocking her view from the audience. \"We can do this the easy way, Jade, or the hard way. You call it.\"\\n\\n She shut her mouth and glared up at him. Caine could see how frightened she was. She was in a near panic. She was actually shaking. \"The easy way is for you to walk over to the minister and recite your vows.\"\\n\\n \"And the hard way?\" Jade asked.\\n\\n \"I drag you over there by your hair,\" Caine told her. He made sure he looked as if he were up to that task, too. \"Either way, I win. We are getting married.\"\\n\\n \"Caine . . .\"\\n\\n The fear in her voice tore at his heart. \"Decide,\" he ordered, his voice hard. \"Easy or hard?\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t let you leave me,\" she whispered. \"I won\u0027t! I\u0027ll leave you first.\"\\n\\n \"What are you stammering about, girl?\" Harry asked.\\n\\n \"Jade? Which is it?\" Caine demanded again, ignoring both her protest and Harry\u0027s interference.\\n\\n Her shoulders sagged. \"Easy.\"\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be walking her over to the preacher man,\" Harry announced. \"Nathan,\" he called out. \"You can trail behind.\"\\n\\n \"In just a minute,\" Caine ordered.\\n\\n While Jade stood there trembling with panic and Harry stood there giving the Duchess downright lecherous looks, Caine went over to the minister and spoke to him. When he was finished, he handed a piece of paper to the man.\\n\\n All was finally ready. Colin stood up at his brother\u0027s side, supported by Caine\u0027s arm. Jade stood beside Caine. Harry had to support her.\\n\\n Jade repeated her vows first, a breach from tradition Caine had insisted upon. He stared at his bride while he repeated each of his vows. He let her keep her gaze downcast until he reached the end of the litany. Then he tilted her chin up and forced her to look at him.\\n\\n She looked so scared, so vulnerable. Her eyes glistened with tears. He loved her so much. He wanted to give her the world. But first he had to gain her trust in him.\\n\\n The minister closed his book, opened the sheet of paper in his hand, and began to read. \"Do you promise to stay with your wife for as long as you shall live? Do you give your word before God and these witnesses that you will never leave her until death do you part?\"\\n\\n Her eyes had widened during the minister\u0027s questions. She turned and saw the paper he was holding. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-38.html","bookId":1791,"book":{"id":1791,"title":"Guardian Angel (Crown\u0027s Spies #2)","description":"Storyline: The Emerald flew across the seas, carrying the pirate Pagan -- despised by the ton, whose riches he plundered, and beloved by the poor, whose plight was eased by his gifts. \\n The Marquess of Cainewood vows to hunt down the pirate wretch in revenge for his brother\u0027s death.
