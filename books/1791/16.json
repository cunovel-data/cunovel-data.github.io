{"id":78797,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\"You may look out the window tomorrow,\" he returned, his voice husky from slumber.\n After making that statement, he took the candle away from her, put it back on the table, and then arrogantly motioned for her to get back in bed.\n \"Does your side hurt?\" he asked.\n She didn\u0027t think he was overly concerned about her injury because he\u0027d yawned when he\u0027d asked the question.\n Jade started to tell him no, that it didn\u0027t pain her much at all, then reconsidered. \"Yes,\" she said. \"It\n stings, but only just a little,\" she added when he looked a bit too concerned. \"Why were you sleeping\n in the chair?\"\n He pulled his shirt off before answering her. \"You were taking up most of the bed,\" he explained.\n \"I didn\u0027t want to move you.\"\n \"Move me? Why would you want to move me?\"\n Caine blew out the candles, pulled the covers back, and stretched out next to her. Then he gave her a roundabout answer. \"I\u0027ll just stay with you until you fall asleep again.\"\n \"But Caine, it isn\u0027t at all proper . . .\"\n \"Go to sleep, love. You need your rest.\"\n She stiffened when he put his arm around her. His hand rested between her breasts. When she tried to ease it away, he captured her hand and held on.\n \"This really isn\u0027t at all. . .\" She quit protesting in mid-sentence, realizing it was wasted effort. Caine was already snoring again and certainly wouldn\u0027t hear a word she said.\n She decided there was little harm in letting him sleep with her for a short while. She had, after all, run\n the man ragged and he surely needed his rest. She\u0027d already noticed how cranky he became when he was weary. Odd, but she found that flaw a bit endearing.\n Jade snuggled up against him and closed her eyes. She instinctively knew he would behave himself. He was a gentleman, and he\u0027d given her his word that he\u0027d never take advantage of her.\n She was obviously just as exhausted as he appeared to be, for she fell asleep with the most confusing thought rambling through her mind.\n She was beginning to wish he wasn\u0027t such a gentleman after all.\n The physician, Sir Hanvick, couldn\u0027t be located for two full days and nights. Caine sent messengers to his London home and to his country estate. Harwick was finally located at the residence of Lady McWilliams, attending to a birthing. He sent a missive back to Caine explaining that as soon as his duty there was completed, he would immediately ride over to Caine\u0027s estate.\n Caine ranted about that inconvenience until Jade reminded him that her condition wasn\u0027t life threatening, a fact, she added, that the messenger had related to the physician, and that she was beginning to feel much better anyway and didn\u0027t need or want anyone poking at her.\n Lingering soon became torture for Jade. She couldn\u0027t stand the confinement.\n The weather mimicked her mood too. Since the moment she\u0027d arrived at Caine\u0027s home, it hadn\u0027t quit raining.\n Caine\u0027s mood was just as sour as her own. He reminded her of a caged animal. Every time he came into her room to speak to her, he paced back and forth, his hands clasped behind his back, while he grilled\n her about her past, her brother, and all the events leading up to the murder she\u0027d witnessed. Caine always ended each dueling session with the remark that he didn\u0027t have enough information yet to draw any substantial conclusions.\n His frustration was almost visible. Jade found fencing with him just as nerve grating. She was careful not to give him too many true facts or too many lies, either, but Lord, it was exhausting work.\n They spent quite a lot of time shouting at each other. Jade accused him of being sorry he ever became involved in her problems. He was, of course, insulted by such an accusation. Still, he didn\u0027t come right out and deny it.\n In her heart, she thought he didn\u0027t find her appealing any longer. Why, he didn\u0027t even try to kiss her anymore, or sleep next to her, and by the third day, he was barely speaking a civil word to her.\n On the fourth night of her confinement, Jade\u0027s control snapped. She tore off the fresh bandage that Sterns had changed for her just a few hours\u0027 earlier, ordered a bath for herself, and then announced that she was fully recovered.\n By the time she finished washing her hair, her frame of mind had improved considerably. Sterns helped her dry the long curls, then sat her in front of the hearth where a full fire blazed.\n After Sterns directed the servants in changing the bedding and removing the tub, he nagged Jade back into bed.\n As soon as darkness fell, Jade gave the signal to her men, then returned to her bed. She opened one of the books she\u0027d borrowed from Caine\u0027s library, and settled down to read to the sound of thunder rumbling in the distance.\n The storm proved to be more than just bluster, however. A giant tree, as tall as Caine\u0027s three-story house, was felled to the ground by a bolt of lightning that was so powerful, the exposed roots glowed an eerie red for a good long while. The clap of thunder shook the house, and the aftermath, a sizzling, crackling sound of wood burning, snapped and popped in the night air like meat roasting over an open fire.\n All the extra hands were needed in the stables to soothe the frightened horses. The scent of fire was in their nostrils, or so Kelley, the head stablemaster, professed. Caine was called when his stallion wouldn\u0027t settle down. As soon as he entered the stables, however, his mount immediately quit his tantrum.\n It was well after midnight when Caine returned to the main house. Though it was only a short distance from the stables, he was still soaked through. He left his boots, socks, jacket, and shirt in the entryway and went upstairs. Another booming clap of thunder shook the house just as Caine was about to enter\n his room.\n Jade must be terrified, he told himself as he changed direction. He would just look in on her to make certain she was all right. If she was sound asleep, he\u0027d leave her alone. If, however, she was still awake . . . well then, perhaps they could have another shouting debate about the ills of the world and the inferiority of women. That thought made Caine smile in anticipation. Jade was turning out to be anything but inferior. She was making a mockery out of his beliefs, too. He\u0027d go to his grave before admitting that fact to her, though, for it was simply too much fun watching her try to cover her own reactions to his opinions.\n It was actually a little stunning when he realized he really wanted to talk to her. Granted, there were several other things he wanted to do as well, but he forced himself to squelch those thoughts.\n He did pause to knock on her door. He didn\u0027t, however, give her time to tell him to go away, or time either, if she was sleeping, to wake up. No, he had the door opened before she could react.\n He was pleased to see she wasn\u0027t sleeping. Caine leaned against the door frame and stared at her a long minute. A warm feeling of contentment filled him. In the last few days he had begun to accept that he liked having her in his house, and even when she frowned at him, he felt he\u0027d arrived in heaven. He really must be daft, he thought then, for he was beginning to love her disgruntled expressions. The fact that he could so easily get her riled indicated that she cared, if only just a little.\n The woman bewitched him. Caine didn\u0027t like admitting that truth ... yet she was so beautiful, so soft, so feminine. A man could only take so much before surrendering. God help him, he knew he was nearing that point.\n It was becoming a torment not to touch her. His mood reflected the struggle he was going through. He felt tied up in knots inside, and every time he saw her, he wanted to take her into his arms and make wild passionate love to her.\n And yet he couldn\u0027t seem to stay away from her. Hour after hour he kept coming into her room to check on her. God, he was even watching her sleep.\n She couldn\u0027t possibly know the torment he was going through. She wouldn\u0027t look so damned serene if\n she had any idea of the fantasies he was considering.\n She really was an innocent. She was sitting up in bed with her back propped up by a mound of pillows, looking so pure and virginal as she shook her head at him.\n Two candles burned on the side table and she held a book in her hands. While he continued to stare at her, she slowly closed the book, her gaze directed on him all the while, and then let out a long sigh.\n \"I knew I should have bolted the door,\" she announced. \"Caine, I\u0027m simply not up to another inquisition tonight.\"\n \"All right.\"\n \"All right?\"\n His easy agreement obviously surprised her. She looked suspicious. \"Do you mean it, sir? You won\u0027t badger me?\"\n \"I mean it,\" he answered with a grin.\n \"You still shouldn\u0027t be here,\" she told him in that husky, sensual voice he found so arousing.\n \"Give me one good reason why I shouldn\u0027t be here.\"\n \"My reputation and your near nakedness,\" she answered.\n \"Those are two reasons,\" he drawled out.\n \"What can you be thinking of?\" she asked when he shut the door behind him. \"Your servants will know you\u0027re here.\"\n \"I thought you didn\u0027t care about your reputation, Jade. Have you changed your mind, then?\"\n She shook her head again. The light from the candles shimmered in her hair with the movement. He was mesmerized. \"I didn\u0027t care about my reputation when I thought you were going to kill me, but now that you\u0027ve given me hope for continued good health, I\u0027ve changed my mind.\"\n \"Jade, Sterns knows I slept in here the first night when . . .\"\n \"That was different,\" she interjected. \"I was ill, injured, and you were concerned. Yes, that was definitely different. Now I\u0027ve recovered. The servants will surely tell your mama, Caine.\"\n \"My mama?\" He burst into laughter. \"You needn\u0027t worry about the servants, Jade. They\u0027re all sleeping. Besides, my motives aren\u0027t lascivious.\"\n She tried not to let him see her disappointment. \"I know,\" she said with another mock sigh. \"But if you\u0027re not up to mischief, why are you here at this hour?\"\n \"Don\u0027t give me that suspicious look,\" he replied. \"I thought you might be frightened by the storm, that\u0027s all.\" He paused to frown at her, and then added, \"Most women would be frightened. You\u0027re not, though, are you?\"\n \"No,\" she answered. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Why are you sorry?\"\n \"Because you look so disappointed. Did you wish to comfort me?\"\n \"That thought did cross my mind,\" he admitted dryly. His frown intensified when he realized she was trying not to laugh at him. He pulled away from the door and walked over to the side of her bed. Jade moved her legs out of the way just a second before he sat down.\n She tried desperately not to stare at his bare chest. The mat of dark, curly hair tapered to a line that\n ended in the middle of his flat stomach. She wanted to run her fingers through the crisp hair, to feel his heat against her breasts, to ...\n \"Hell, Jade, most women would have been afraid.\"\n His voice pulled her from her erotic thoughts. \"I\u0027m not most women,\" she replied. \"You\u0027d best understand that now, Caine.\"\n He was having trouble understanding much of anything now. He stared at the buttons on the top of her white nightgown, thinking about the silky skin hidden beneath.\n His sigh was ragged. Now that he knew she wasn\u0027t worried about the storm, he really should leave. His pants, wet from the storm, were probably soaking the covers.\n He knew he should leave, but he couldn\u0027t seem to move.\n \"I\u0027m not at all like most of the women you know,\" she announced, just to fill the sudden awkward silence. Drops of water clung to his muscular shoulders and upper arms. In the candlelight, the moisture made his bronzed skin glisten. She turned her attention to his lap. That was a mistake, she realized. The bulge between his thighs was very evident. . . and arousing. She could feel herself blush in reaction.\n \"You\u0027re soaking wet,\" she blurted out. \"Have you been walking in the storm, you daft man?\"\n \"I had to go to the stables to help quiet the horses.\"\n \"Your hair turns to curl when it\u0027s wet,\" she added. \"You must have hated that when you were a child.\"\n \"I hated it so much I wouldn\u0027t share my toys,\" he drawled out.\n His gaze turned to her chest. He noticed her hardened ni**les brushing against the thin fabric of her gown. It took a supreme act of discipline not to touch her. His control was close to snapping, and even a simple goodnight kiss would make him forget his good intentions.\n Another bolt of lightning lit up the room, followed by an ear-piercing explosion of thunder. Caine was off the bed and standing by the window before Jade had kicked the covers away.\n \"That surely hit something,\" Caine announced. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen a storm as fierce as this one.\"\n He peered into the darkness, looking for signs of a budding fire. Then he felt Jade take hold of his hand. He hid his concern when he turned to look down at her.\n \"It will wear out very soon,\" she promised. She nodded when he looked so surprised, squeezed his hand to reassure him, and added, \"You\u0027ll see.\"\n He couldn\u0027t believe she was actually trying to comfort him. Since she looked so sincere, he didn\u0027t dare laugh. He didn\u0027t want to hurt her tender feelings, and if she felt the need to soothe him, he\u0027d let her.\n \"Uncle use to tell me the angels were brawling whenever there was a thunderstorm,\" she said. \"He made it sound as if they were having quite a party.\"\n \"And did you believe your uncle?\" he asked, a smile in his voice.\n \"No.\"\n He did laugh then, a full booming sound that reminded her of thunder.\n \"I have grown to appreciate your honesty, Jade. I find it most appealing.\"\n She didn\u0027t look as though she wanted to hear that opinion. She let go of his hand and shook her head again. \"Everything\u0027s always black and white to you, isn\u0027t it? There\u0027s never any room for deviations, is there? I tried to believe my uncle, but I knew he was lying to soothe my fear. Sometimes, Caine, a lie is all for the good. Do you understand what I\u0027m saying?\"\n He stared down at her for a long minute. \"Give me another example, Jade.\" His voice was whisper soft. \"Have you ever lied to me?\"\n She slowly nodded.\n Several heartbeats later, Caine asked, \"And what was this lie?\"\n She didn\u0027t answer him soon enough to please him. His hands were suddenly on her shoulders and he forcefully turned her to face him. Then he nudged her chin up, demanding she look at him. \"Explain this lie!\" he demanded.\n The look in his eyes chilled her. She couldn\u0027t find any warmth there. The color had turned the gray of winter mornings. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-16.html","bookId":1791,"book":{"id":1791,"title":"Guardian Angel (Crown\u0027s Spies #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Emerald flew across the seas, carrying the pirate Pagan -- despised by the ton, whose riches he plundered, and beloved by the poor, whose plight was eased by his gifts. \n The Marquess of Cainewood vows to hunt down the pirate wretch in revenge for his brother\u0027s death.
