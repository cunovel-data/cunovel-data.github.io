He was trying to keep his temper controlled, but the urge to shout at her made his throat ache. \"When would you like this ... this .. .\" \"Task?\" \"Yes, task,\" Caine asked. \"When would you like this task done?\" \"Now.\" \"Now?\" \"If it\u0027s convenient, mi\u0027lord.\" \"If it\u0027s convenient?\" \"Oh, dear, I\u0027m so sorry,\" she whispered. \"I didn\u0027t mean to upset you.\" \"Why do you think you\u0027ve upset me?\" \"Because you\u0027re shouting at me.\" He realized she was right. He had been shouting. Caine let out a long sigh. For the first time in a good long while, his composure was completely shattered. He excused his shameful condition by telling himself that anyone with half a mind would have been caught off guard by such an outrageous request. She looked so sincere and appeared to be terribly fragile, too. Hell, the woman had freckles on the bridge of her nose, for God\u0027s sake. She should be home under lock and key with her loving family protecting her, not standing in this seedy tavern calmly discussing her own murder. \"I can see how distressed I\u0027ve made you,\" she said. \"I really do apologize, Pagan. Have you never killed a woman before?\" she asked. Her voice was filled with sympathy. She looked as if she felt sorry for him now. \"No, I\u0027ve never killed a woman before,\" he grated out. \"But there\u0027s always a first time for everything, now isn\u0027t there?\" He\u0027d meant the comment to be sarcastic. She took it to heart. \"That\u0027s the spirit,\" she rushed out. She actually smiled at him then. \"It really shouldn\u0027t be too difficult for you. I\u0027ll help, of course.\" He wanted to throw his head down on the table. \"You\u0027re willing to help?\" he strangled out. \"Certainly.\" \"You have lost your mind.\" \"No, I haven\u0027t,\" she countered. \"But I\u0027m very desperate. This task must be done as soon as possible. Do you think you could hurry and finish your drink?\" \"Why must it be done so soon?\" he asked. \"Because they\u0027re going to come for me sometime soon, perhaps even yet tonight. I\u0027m going to die, Pagan, by their hand or yours, and I\u0027d really rather determine my own end. Surely you can understand that.\" \"Then why don\u0027t you just kill yourself?\" Monk blurted out. \"Wouldn\u0027t that be much easier than hiring someone else?\" \"For God\u0027s sake, Monk, don\u0027t encourage her.\" \"I\u0027m not trying to encourage her,\" Monk rushed out. \"I\u0027m just trying to understand why such a pretty would want to die.\" \"Oh, I could never kill myself,\" she explained. \"It would be a sin. Someone else has to do it. Don\u0027t you see?\" Caine had taken about all he could handle for one evening. He bounded to his feet, upsetting the chair in his haste, then planted the palms of his big hands on the tabletop. \"No, I don\u0027t see, but I promise you I\u0027m going to before this night is over. We\u0027re going to start at the beginning. First you\u0027ll begin by telling me your name.\" \"Why?\" \"It\u0027s a little rule I have,\" he snapped. \"I don\u0027t kill anyone I don\u0027t know. Now tell me your name.\" \"It\u0027s a stupid rule.\" \"Answer me.\" \"Jade.\" \"Damn it, I want your real name!\" he commanded in a near roar. \"Damn it, that is my real name,\" she replied. She had a thoroughly disgruntled look on her face. \"You\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Of course, I\u0027m serious. Jade is my name,\" she added with a shrug. \"Jade\u0027s an unusual name,\" he said. \"Fitting, though. You\u0027re proving to be a rather unusual woman.\" \"Your opinion of me isn\u0027t at all relevant, sir. I hired you to complete an assignment and that is all. Is it customary for you to interview your victims before you do them in?\" He ignored her glare. \"Tell me the rest of your name, or I may strangle you.\" \"No, you mustn\u0027t strangle me,\" she replied. \"I don\u0027t want to die that way and I am the one doing the hiring, if you\u0027ll remember.\" \"What way did you have in mind?\" he asked. \"Oh, hell, never mind. I don\u0027t want to know.\" \"But you have to know,\" she argued. \"How can you kill me if you don\u0027t know how I want it done?\" \"Later,\" he interjected. \"You may instruct me in the method you\u0027ve chosen later. First things first, Jade. Are your parents waiting at home for you?\" \"It\u0027s doubtful.\" \"Why?\" \"They\u0027re both dead.\" He closed his eyes and counted to ten. \"So you\u0027re all alone?\" \"No.\" \"No?\" It was her turn to sigh. \"I have a brother. I\u0027m not going to tell you anything more, Pagan. It\u0027s too much of a risk, you see.\" \"Why is it a risk, miss?\" Monk asked. \"The more he knows about me, the more difficult the task will become. I believe it would be very upsetting to kill someone you liked. Don\u0027t you, sir?\" \"I ain\u0027t never had to kill someone I liked,\" Monk admitted. \"As to that, I ain\u0027t never killed anyone. Still, your theory makes sense to me.\" It took all Caine had not to start bellowing. \"Jade, I assure you that won\u0027t be a problem. At this moment, I don\u0027t like you at all.\" She took a step back. \"Well, why not?\" she asked. \"I haven\u0027t been half as insulting as you have. Are you just a cranky person by nature, Pagan?\" \"Don\u0027t call me Pagan.\" \"Why not?\" \"It\u0027s a danger, miss, if anyone overhears,\" Monk blurted out when he saw how infuriated Caine was becoming. The muscle in the side of his jaw had started flexing. Caine had a fierce temper and she was innocently shaking him into a real froth. Why if he let loose, he might very well give her her wish and frighten her to death. \"What should I call him then?\" she asked the tavernkeeper. \"Caine,\" Monk answered with a nod. \"You can call him Caine,\" She let out an inelegant snort. \"And he thinks I have an unusual name?\" Caine reached out and grabbed hold of her chin. He forced her to look at him again. \"What is your brother\u0027s name?\" \"Nathan.\" \"Where is Nathan now?\" \"He\u0027s away on pressing business matters.\" \"What business?\" She slapped his hand away before answering. \"Shipping business.\" \"When will he be back?\" Her glare could melt a lesser man. \"Two weeks,\" she snapped. \"There, I\u0027ve answered all your questions. Now will you please quit pestering me and get on with your assignment?\" \"Where do you live, Jade?\" \"Sir, your endless questions are giving me a pounding headache. I\u0027m not at all used to having men scream at me.\" Caine glanced down at Monk and let him see his exasperation. \"The daft woman wants me to kill her, yet now complains about a headache.\" She suddenly reached out, grabbed hold of his chin, and nudged him back to look at her. It was a deliberate imitation of his earlier action. Caine was so surprised by her boldness, he let her have her way. \"Now it\u0027s my turn,\" she announced. \"I\u0027ll ask you my questions and you will answer them. I\u0027m the one giving you the silver coins, sir. First, and most important, I want to know if you\u0027re really going to kill me. Your hesitation alarms me. That and this endless inquisition.\" \"You\u0027re going to have to satisfy my curiosity before I decide,\" he told her. \"No.\" \"Then I won\u0027t kill you.\" \"You scoundrel!\" she cried out. \"You promised me before you knew who your victim was. You gave me your word!\" \"I lied.\" Her gasp of outrage nearly knocked her over. \"You are a real disappointment to me. A man of honor wouldn\u0027t so easily break his word. You should be ashamed of yourself.\" \"Jade,\" he answered. \"I never said I was a man of honor.\" \"Nay, miss, he didn\u0027t,\" Monk interjected. Her eyes turned the color of green fire. She was apparently furious with him. Her hands joined his on the tabletop. She leaned forward and whispered, \"I was told Pagan never, ever breaks his word.\" \"You were misinformed.\" They were almost nose to nose now. Caine tried to concentrate on their conversation, but her wonderful scent, so clean, so fresh, so utterly feminine, kept getting in the way. She was shaking her head at him now. Caine was literally at a loss for words. He\u0027d never had a woman stand up to him before. No, the ladies of the ton usually cowered when he showed the least amount of displeasure. This one was different, however. She wasn\u0027t just standing up to him either. She was actually matching him glare for glare. He suddenly felt like laughing and didn\u0027t have the faintest idea why. Her insanity was obviously the catching kind. \"You really should be hanged,\" she said. \"You certainly had me fooled. You don\u0027t look like the sort to act so dastardly.\" She tried to move away from the table but Caine\u0027s hands covered hers, trapping her. He leaned down again, until his mouth was just a scant kiss away. \"I\u0027m a pirate, madam. We\u0027re known to be dastardly.\" He waited for another angry rebuttal. She burst into tears instead. Caine wasn\u0027t at all prepared for that emotional display. While he reached for his handkerchief, Monk jumped to his feet and rushed over to comfort her. The barkeep awkwardly patted her on her shoulders. \"There, there, miss, don\u0027t cry now.\" \"It\u0027s all his fault,\" she sobbed. \"All I asked was a simple little favor. Just one quick task that wouldn\u0027t take him any time at all; but, no, he couldn\u0027t be bothered. I even offered to wait until he\u0027d finished his refreshment,\" she continued with a wail. \"I was willing to pay good coins too.\" By the time she\u0027d finished her pitiful tirade, Monk was glaring at Caine. \"You\u0027ve upset the pretty,\" he told the Marquess. \"Why, you\u0027ve broken her heart.\" The tavernkeeper grabbed the handkerchief out of Caine\u0027s hand and began to awkwardly mop the tears away from her cheeks. \"It will be all right, miss,\" he crooned. \"No, it won\u0027t,\" she argued. Her voice was muffled by the linen cloth Monk had shoved under her nose. \"Do you know I\u0027ve never asked anyone for anything in all my days? Yet the very first time I do ask, I\u0027m denied my request. No one wants to make an honest living anymore. No, they\u0027d rather steal than earn their way. It\u0027s a shame, isn\u0027t it, Monk?\" Caine was too incredulous to speak. He didn\u0027t know if he should take her into his arms and comfort her or grab her by the shoulders and shake some sense into her. One thing was certain, however. If Monk continued to frown at him, he was going to break his nose. \"Mi\u0027Iady, it really ain\u0027t honest work to take coins from a lady and kill her,\" Monk argued. He patted her shoulder in a bid to soften his gentle rebuke. \"Of course it\u0027s honest work,\" she replied. \"As long as the lady wants the killing done.\" Monk paused to rub his brow. \"She\u0027s got a true point there, don\u0027t she?\" he asked Caine. \"For the love of... now what are you doing?\" Caine asked Jade when she began to collect her coins. \"I\u0027m leaving,\" she announced. \"I\u0027m sorry I bothered you, Pagan, or Caine, or whatever your real name is,\" she whispered. She tied the string into a knot, then tucked the bag in her pocket. When she turned and started for the door, Caine called out. \"Where do you think you\u0027re going?\" \"That\u0027s none of your concern,\" she answered. \"Still, I\u0027m not half as insolent as you are and so I shall tell you I\u0027m going to find someone more cooperative. Have no fear, sir. I won\u0027t give up. Before this black night is over, I\u0027ll find someone willing to kill me.\" He caught her at the door. His hands settled on her shoulders and he slowly forced her around to look at him. The minute he touched her, she started crying again. Caine was exasperated, unsettled too. He gave in to his overwhelming urge though, and roughly pulled her into his arms. His bear hug seemed to be all the prodding she needed. She wept against his chest, whispering her apology for her unladylike behavior in between her loud sobs. Caine was content to wait until she\u0027d regained a bit of control. He couldn\u0027t possibly reason with her now. She was making so much noise she wouldn\u0027t have been able to hear a word he said anyway. And she kept blaming her current condition on him too. She was, without a doubt, the most confusing woman he\u0027d ever encountered. Lord, she was wonderfully soft. She fit him nicely too. He usually disliked women who cried, yet found he didn\u0027t want to let go of this one. She was hiccupping just like a drunken peasant now, the aftermath of the quick storm. It was high time he reasoned with her. \"Jade, it can\u0027t possibly be as terrible as you now believe,\" he told her in a low, husky voice. \"Surely, come morning, you\u0027ll be thankful I didn\u0027t give in to your request.\" \"I\u0027ll be dead come morning,\" she wailed. \"No, you won\u0027t,\" he replied. He gave her an affectionate squeeze. \"I won\u0027t let anything happen to you. I promise. You can\u0027t really want to die just yet.\" \"My brother\u0027s bound to be disappointed if I die,\" she said. \"I would imagine so,\" he answered dryly. \"Still, I\u0027m not strong enough to fight them. They\u0027re very mean-hearted men. I fear they\u0027ll use me before they kill me. I don\u0027t want to die that way. There\u0027s no dignity in it.\" \"Death with dignity?\" he asked. \"You speak like a soldier preparing for the battlefield.\" \"I don\u0027t want to be remembered as a coward.\" \"Will your brother be able to take care of your problem once he returns?\" \"Oh, yes,\" she answered. She rested her cheek against his chest. \"Nathan wouldn\u0027t let anything happen","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-2.html","bookId":1791,"book":{"id":1791,"title":"Guardian Angel (Crown\u0027s Spies #2)","description":"Storyline: The Emerald flew across the seas, carrying the pirate Pagan -- despised by the ton, whose riches he plundered, and beloved by the poor, whose plight was eased by his gifts.
