His grin was downright shameful. \"Lyon, stay out of this,\" Caine ordered. \"Well, as soon as I realized who it was, I quit trying to stab him. He gave me a startle. I thought he was a thief.\" Lyon looked like he was dying to say something more. Caine glared him into keeping silent. \"Did you find out anything?\" Caine called out. Lyon nodded. He started into the room. \"Christina? Take Jade into the drawing room, would you?\" \"She\u0027ll have to go in there on her own,\" Christina answered. \"I promised to sharpen her knife for her. Jade? I couldn\u0027t find it under your pillow. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been trying to explain.\" \"He took it,\" Jade answered with a wave in Caine\u0027s direction. \"I believe I saw him put it on the mantle, though I\u0027m not absolutely certain. Would you like me to help you look for it?\" \"No, I\u0027ll find it. You go and keep Dakota company. He\u0027s playing on his blanket inside. I\u0027ll join you in just a few minutes.\" Jade hurriedly followed Christina out of the room. She paused at the drawing room doors when she heard Lyon\u0027s booming laughter. She smiled then, guessing Caine had just told his friend what an imbecile he thought she was. She was feeling quite smug now. It took a certain concentration to be able to ramble on and on so convincingly, and she thought she\u0027d pulled it off quite nicely. She had no idea she was so talented. Still, she was honest enough to admit to herself that there had been a moment when she hadn\u0027t really been pretending. Jade straightened her shoulders. Pretense or not, rambling was definitely a plus when dealing with Caine. She went inside the room then and closed the door behind her. She spotted the quilted blanket in front of the settee right away. Christina\u0027s son, however, was quite another matter. She couldn\u0027t find him anywhere. She was about to shout an alarm when she noticed a tiny foot protruding from the back of the settee. She hurried over and knelt down, briefly thought about pulling him out by his one foot, and then decided she\u0027d better find the rest of him first. With her backside in the air, she leaned down until the side of her face rested on the carpet. The most magnificent blue eyes she\u0027d ever seen were just inches away from her now. Dakota. Jade thought she might have startled him by her sudden appearance. His eyes did widen. He didn\u0027t cry, though. No, he stared at her a long, drooling moment, and then gave her a wide, toothless grin. She thought he was the most amazing infant. Once he\u0027d finished smiling at her, he went back to his main interest. He seemed determined to gum his way through the ornately carved wooden leg of the settee. \"Oh, that can\u0027t be at all good for you, little boy,\" Jade announced. He didn\u0027t spare her a glance as he continued to chew on the wood. \"Stop that now, Dakota,\" she commanded. \"Your mama will be unhappy if she sees you eating the furniture. Come out here, please.\" It was obvious that she had no experience handling children. It was also a fact that she didn\u0027t realize she had an audience watching her either. Both Caine and Lyon leaned against opposite door frames observing the pair. They were both trying not to laugh. \"You aren\u0027t going to cooperate, are you, Dakota?\" Jade asked. The baby gurgled happily in answer to that remark. \"She\u0027s innovative, I\u0027ll give her that,\" Lyon whispered to Caine when Jade lifted the edge of the settee and moved it to the side. She then sat down on the floor next to the little one. He immediately wiggled his way toward her. She wasn\u0027t at all certain how to lift a baby. She\u0027d heard that their little necks weren\u0027t strong enough to hold their heads up until they were at least a year or so. Dakota, however, had lifted his chest off the carpet and seemed to be strong enough on his own. He made the most delightful sounds. He was such a happy little boy. She couldn\u0027t resist touching him. She gingerly patted the top of his head, then eased her hands under his arms and slowly dragged him up onto her lap. She wanted to cuddle him against her bosom. He wanted something else. Dakota grabbed hold of a clump of her hair, pulled on it, hard, while he tried to find his supper. It didn\u0027t take her any time at all to realize what he was trying to do. \"No, no, Dakota,\" she whispered when he arched up against her and started to fret. \"Your mama\u0027s going to have to feed you. Shall we go and find her, love?\" Jade slowly gained her feet, keeping the baby close against her. His grip on her hair stung, but she didn\u0027t mind. The baby smelled so wonderful. He was beautiful, too. He had his mother\u0027s blue eyes, but his dark curls came from his father. Jade stroked the baby\u0027s back and softly crooned to him. She was in awe of him. She turned and noticed the men then. Jade could feel herself blush. \"You have a fine son,\" she told Lyon in a stammer. Caine stayed by the door while Lyon went to claim Dakota. He had to pry his son\u0027s hands away from Jade\u0027s hair. She stared at Caine, wondering over the odd expression on his face now. There was tenderness there, but something else as well. She didn\u0027t have any idea what he was thinking. \"He\u0027s the first baby I\u0027ve ever held,\" she told Lyon after he\u0027d lifted his son into his arms. \"I\u0027d say that you are a natural,\" Lyon replied. \"Wouldn\u0027t you agree, Dakota?\" he asked. He held the baby up until they were eye level. Dakota immediately grinned. Christina breezed into the room, drawing Jade\u0027s attention. She hurried over and handed her friend the sharpened knife. The dagger was inside a soft leather carrier. \"It\u0027s sharp enough now,\" she told Jade. \"I made the pouch so you wouldn\u0027t accidentally prick yourself.\" \"Thank you,\" Jade replied. \"You aren\u0027t going to need a knife,\" Caine announced. He moved away from his lazy repose and walked over to Jade\u0027s side. \"Let me keep it for you, sweet. You\u0027ll hurt yourself.\" \"I will not give it to you,\" she announced. \"It was a gift from my uncle and I promised him I\u0027d always have it with me.\" He gave in when she backed away from him. \"We have to get going,\" he told her then. \"Lyon, you\u0027ll. . .\" \"I will,\" Lyon returned. \"Just as soon as I\u0027ve . . .\" \"Right,\" Caine interrupted. \"They seem to be speaking in a different language, don\u0027t they?\" Christina said to Jade. \"They don\u0027t want me to worry,\" Jade explained. \"Then you understood what they were saying?\" \"Of course. Lyon is suppose to start his investigation. Caine\u0027s obviously given him a few suggestions. As soon as he\u0027s found out anything of consequence, he\u0027ll get in touch with Caine.\" Lyon and Caine were staring intently at her. \"You deducted all that from ...\" She interrupted Caine with a nod. Then she turned to Lyon. \"You\u0027re going to try to find out if there\u0027s anyone gone missing of late, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Yes,\" Lyon admitted. \"You\u0027ll need a description, won\u0027t you? Of course, the poor man\u0027s nose was a bit scrunched from the fall. Still, I could tell he was quite old, almost forty, I would guess. He had gray hair, bushy eyebrows, and cold brown eyes. He didn\u0027t look at all peaceful in death, either. He\u0027d gone to fat, too, around the middle. That\u0027s yet another reason to suppose he was a member of the ton.\" \"Why is that?\" Caine asked. \"Because he had more than enough to eat for one,\" she countered. \"There weren\u0027t any callouses on his hands, either. No, he certainly wasn\u0027t a working man. I can tell you that much.\" \"Come and sit down,\" Lyon suggested. \"We\u0027d like to have descriptions of the other men as well.\" \"I fear there isn\u0027t much to tell,\" she said. \"I barely saw them. I don\u0027t know if they were tall or short, fat or thin .. .\" She stopped to sigh. \"There were three of them and that\u0027s all I had time to notice.\" She looked distressed. Caine thought she was still frightened of the ordeal she\u0027d gone through. She had seen a man fall to his death, after all, and she was such a gentle woman, she couldn\u0027t be used to such horrors. Jade was upset, yes, and when Caine put his arm around her shoulders, she felt all the more guilty. For the first time in her life, she actually disliked lying. She kept trying to tell herself that her motives were pure. The reminder didn\u0027t help at all, though. She was deceiving three very nice people. \"We have to leave,\" she blurted out. \"The longer we stay, the more danger we put this family in, Caine. Yes, we must leave now.\" She didn\u0027t give anyone time to argue with her but rushed over to the entrance. \"Caine? Do you have a home in the country somewhere?\" she asked, knowing full well that he did. \"Yes.\" \"I think we should go there. You can keep me safe away from London.\" \"We aren\u0027t going to Harwythe, Jade.\" \"Harwythe?\" \"The name of my country estate,\" he answered. \"I\u0027m taking you to my parents\u0027 home. Their property borders mine. You might not be concerned about your reputation, but I am. I\u0027ll come and see you every day to make certain you\u0027re doing all right. I\u0027ll place guards around .. . now why are you shaking your head at me?\" \"You\u0027ll come and visit me? Caine, you\u0027re already breaking your word to me,\" she cried out. \"We are not going to involve your parents in this. You promised me you\u0027d keep me safe and by God, you aren\u0027t going to leave my side until it\u0027s over.\" \"She sounds determined, Caine,\" Lyon interjected. \"I am in wholehearted agreement with Jade,\" Christina interjected. \"Why?\" Both Caine and Lyon asked at the same time. Christina shrugged. \"Because she\u0027s my friend. I must agree with her, mustn\u0027t I?\" Neither man had a valid argument for that explanation. Jade was pleased. \"Thank you, Christina. I will always agree with you, as well,\" she added. Caine shook his head. \"Jade,\" he began, thinking to draw her back to their original topic. \"I am thinking about your safety when I suggest you stay with my parents.\" \"No.\" \"Do you honestly believe you\u0027ll be safe with me?\" She took exception to his incredulous tone of voice. \"I most certainly do.\" \"Sweet, I\u0027m not going to be able to keep my hands off you for two long weeks. I\u0027m trying to be noble about this, damn it.\" In the blink of an eye, her face turned crimson. \"Caine,\" she whispered. \"You shouldn\u0027t be saying such things in front of our guests.\" \"They aren\u0027t our guests,\" he countered in a near shout of obvious frustration. \"We\u0027re their guests.\" \"The man\u0027s always using blasphemies around me,\" she told Christina. \"He won\u0027t apologize either.\" \"Jade!\" Caine roared. \"Quit trying to change the topic.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you should shout at her, Caine,\" Christina advised. \"He can\u0027t help himself,\" Jade explained. \"It\u0027s because of his cranky nature,\" \"I\u0027m not cranky,\" Caine announced in a much lower tone of voice. \"I\u0027m just being honest. I don\u0027t mean to embarrass you.\" \"It\u0027s too late,\" Jade countered. \"You\u0027ve already embarrassed me.\" Both Christina and Lyon looked absolutely mesmerized by the conversation. Caine turned to his friend. \"Don\u0027t you have someplace to go?\" \"No.\" \"Leave anyway,\" Caine ordered. Lyon raised an eyebrow, then gave in. \"Come along, wife. We can wait in the dining room. Caine? You\u0027re going to have to let her explain a few more facts before you leave if you want me to . ..\" \"Later,\" Caine announced. Christina followed her husband and son out of the room. She paused to squeeze Jade\u0027s hand on her way past her. \"It\u0027s best not to fight it,\" she whispered. \"Your fate has already been determined.\" Jade didn\u0027t pay any attention to that remark. She nodded just to please Christina, then shut the door and whirled around to confront Caine again. Her hands settled on her hips. \"It\u0027s absolutely ridiculous to worry about keeping your hands off me. You won\u0027t take advantage of me unless I let you. I trust you,\" she added with a vehement nod. Her hands flew to her bodice. \"With all my heart,\" she added quite dramatically. \"Don\u0027t.\" The harshness in his tone startled her. She quickly recovered. \"Too late, Caine. I already do trust you. You\u0027ll keep me safe and I won\u0027t let you touch me. We have an easy pact, sir. Don\u0027t you try to muddy the waters now with last-minute worries. It will all work out. I promise you.\" A commotion in the entryway drew their attention. Caine recognized the voice. One of his grooms was stammering out his need to find his employer. \"That\u0027s Perry,\" Caine told Jade. \"He\u0027s one of my grooms. You stay inside this room while I see what he wants.\" She didn\u0027t obey that command, of course, but followed behind him. When she saw Lyon\u0027s dark expression, she knew something foul had happened. Then her attention turned to the servant. The young man had wide hazel eyes and dark crinkly hair that stood up on end. He couldn\u0027t seem to catch his breath but kept making a circle with the hat he clutched in his hands. \"Everything be lost, mi\u0027lord,\" Perry blurted out. \"Merlin said to tell you it were a miracle the whole block wasn\u0027t set afire. The Earl of Haselet\u0027s town house was just a bit scorched. There be smoke damage we would imagine, but the outside walls are still intact.\" \"Perry, what are you ...\" \"Your town house caught fire, Caine,\" Lyon interjected. \"Isn\u0027t that what you\u0027re trying to tell us, Perry?\" The servant quickly nodded. \"It weren\u0027t carelessness,\" he defended. \"We don\u0027t know how it started, mi\u0027lord, but there weren\u0027t any candles burning, no fire unattended in the hearths. God be my witness, it weren\u0027t carelessness.\" \"No one is blaming you,\" Caine said. He kept his voice contained, his anger hidden. What the hell else could go wrong? he wondered. \"Accidents happen.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-10.html","bookId":1791,"book":{"id":1791,"title":"Guardian Angel (Crown\u0027s Spies #2)","description":"Storyline: The Emerald flew across the seas, carrying the pirate Pagan -- despised by the ton, whose riches he plundered, and beloved by the poor, whose plight was eased by his gifts.
