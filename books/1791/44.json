I hate to disappoint you, but the handwriting didn\u0027t look at all familiar.\" \"I doubt she wrote those notes,\" Caine returned. \"She\u0027s old, Jade, but she hasn\u0027t gotten careless yet. No, she probably had one of her assistants pen the letters.\" \"Would you like for me to steal . . .\" \"I\u0027d like you to stay here day and night,\" he stated. The suggestion was given as a command. \"This is going to get sticky before it\u0027s finished. Everything I\u0027ve gathered is actually circumstantial evidence in a court, Jade. I\u0027ve still got some work to do. Now promise me you won\u0027t leave.\" \"I promise,\" she answered. \"Have a little faith in me, husband. You know that once I give my word, I\u0027ll keep it. Please tell me what you have planned.\" \"Lyon\u0027s been itching to put a little pressure on Willburn. I think it\u0027s time he had his way. Willburn hasn\u0027t been at all accommodating thus far. We hoped he\u0027d lead us to Ice, but he stays hidden behind his drapes all day. Yes, it\u0027s time we had a talk with him.\" \"I don\u0027t like the idea of you leaving every night, Caine. Until the ship is burned and the rumor of Pagan\u0027s death hits London, I think you should stay home. I\u0027ll tell you this, sir, if the people in this town celebrate my death, I\u0027m going to be very disappointed.\" Caine\u0027s smile was gentle. \"They would mourn,\" he promised. \"Anyway, we\u0027ll never know. It isn\u0027t necessary to burn the ship now.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I know who Ice is,\" he explained. \"And she isn\u0027t going to quit coming after me, either. She knows we\u0027re on to her.\" \"Yes,\" Jade countered. \"If you hadn\u0027t made me lie about not knowing how to read, she wouldn\u0027t be on to us, husband. See? That lie wasn\u0027t all for the good.\" \"Don\u0027t sound so smug, my love.\" \"Harry\u0027s going to be happy he doesn\u0027t have to burn a ship,\" she announced, ignoring his remark. \"You will send someone to tell him, won\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, I\u0027ll send someone to Shallow\u0027s Wharf,\" he replied. \"You\u0027re going to have to tell me exactly where that is, Jade. It\u0027s an operative name for somewhere else, isn\u0027t it?\" Jade cuddled up against her husband. \"You are so clever,\" she whispered. \"You will be careful when you go out, won\u0027t you? She\u0027s on to us, all right. I don\u0027t want you turning your back on anyone, Caine. I have come to rely on you.\" \"And I have come to rely on you,\" he answered. His grin was telling. \"This is sounding damned equal to me.\" \"It is equal,\" she said. \"But you can pretend it isn\u0027t if it will make you feel better.\" He ignored that comment and tickled the side of her neck instead. Jade shivered in reaction. \"Do you feel like another dance lesson now?\" \"Will I be on my knees again?\" \"Didn\u0027t you like it, love? You acted like you did. Your mouth was so sweet, so . . .\" \"I liked it,\" she admitted in a rush. \"Can we?\" \"Oh, yes.\" Her voice was breathless. \"Upstairs or here?\" \"Upstairs,\" she whispered. She stood up and tugged on his hand. \"But this time, Caine, I want to lead.\" They spent the rest of the day in each others\u0027 arms. It was a blissful time that ended all too soon. Before she knew it, she was reminding him to remember McKindry and he was demanding her promise to stay put until he returned. Jade was so exhausted, she slept quite soundly until an hour or so before dawn. She awakened with a start, then rolled on her side to take Caine into her arms. He wasn\u0027t there. Jade rushed downstairs to check inside the library. Caine hadn\u0027t come back to her yet. Since he\u0027d never taken this long before, she started worrying. She\u0027d worked herself into a frenzy when another hour passed and he still hadn\u0027t returned. Her instincts were screaming a warning. Something was terribly wrong. The familiar ache had settled in her stomach just like in the old days when a plan would go amiss. She had to be ready. Jade dressed in quick time, added a dagger to her pocket, the special clip to her hair, then resumed pacing again. Caine had left two guards for her protection. One stood in the shadows outside the front door and the other guarded the back entrance. Jade decided to talk to Cyril, the man guarding the front entrance. Perhaps he\u0027d know what they should do. She opened the door just in time to see a man hand Cyril a piece of paper and then run away. Cyril bounded up the steps two at a time. \"It\u0027s a letter for you,\" he said. \"At this hour of the night,\" he added in a near growl. \"It can\u0027t be good news, mi\u0027lady.\" \"I hope it\u0027s from Caine,\" she blurted out. \"Come inside, Cyril. Bolt the door behind you. Something\u0027s wrong,\" she added as she tore the seal from the envelope. \"Caine has never taken this long before.\" Cyril grumbled his agreement. \"Aye,\" he said. \"I feel it in my gut.\" \"Me, too,\" Jade whispered. As soon as Jade unfolded the sheet of paper, she paled. She recognized the script immediately. The note came from Ice. \"What is it, mi\u0027lady?\" Cyril asked. He spoke in a hushed tone, an oddity, that, for Cyril was a big man with a booming voice to match. \"Caine\u0027s in trouble,\" Jade whispered. \"I have one hour to go to a building on Lathrop Street. Do you know where that is?\" \"It\u0027s a warehouse if it\u0027s on Lathrop,\" Cyril answered. \"I don\u0027t like this,\" he added. \"I\u0027m sniffing a trap. What happens if we don\u0027t go?\" \"They\u0027ll kill my husband.\" \"I\u0027ll go fetch Alden,\" Cyril announced. He started toward the back door but stopped when Jade called out to him. \"I\u0027m not going.\" \"But...\" \"I can\u0027t leave. I have to stay here, Cyril. This could be a trick and I gave my word to Caine. No, I have to stay here. Do you know how late White\u0027s stays open?\" \"It\u0027s closed for certain by now.\" \"Caine might have gone to have a talk with a man named Willburn. Do you know where he lives?\" \"I do,\" the guard answered. \"He\u0027s just six, perhaps seven blocks oven\" \"Send Alden over there now. Lyon and Caine might be having a visitation with the infidel.\" \"And if they aren\u0027t?\" \"While Alden goes to Willburn\u0027s house, I want you to run over to Lyon\u0027s residence. Now then, if Lyon isn\u0027t home, then go on to Sir Richards\u0027 town house. Do you know where those two men live?\" \"Yes,\" Cyril said. \"But who will guard you while we\u0027re tracking Caine down? You\u0027ll be all alone.\" \"I\u0027ll bolt the doors,\" she promised. \"Please hurry, Cyril. We need to find Caine before the hour is up. If we can\u0027t find him, then I have to assume the note wasn\u0027t trickery.\" \"We\u0027ll hurry,\" Cyril promised on his way toward the back of the house. Jade clutched the letter in her hands and stood in the center of the foyer a long while. She then went upstairs to her bedroom. She bolted the door behind her. The pounding started on the front door just a few minutes later. She knew it wasn\u0027t Caine. He had a key, of course. The sound of glass shattering came next. Had she inadvertently played right into their hands? Were they so certain she\u0027d send the guards to look for Caine? Jade found solace in that possibility, for it meant Caine hadn\u0027t been taken captive after all. She prayed she was right, prayed, too, that God wouldn\u0027t get angry with her. She was probably going to have to kill someone, and very soon, judging from the sounds of men lumbering up the steps. Jade grabbed the pistol from the drawer of the nightstand on Caine\u0027s side of the bed, backed herself into a corner, and took aim. She decided she would wait until they\u0027d broken the latch, then shoot the first man who entered the room. Her hand was steady. A deadly calm came over her, too. And then the door was kicked open. A dark form filled the entrance. And still she waited, for she wanted to be absolutely certain it was her enemy and not one of Caine\u0027s hired men arriving to save her. \"Light a candle,\" the voice shouted. \"I can\u0027t see the bitch.\" Jade squeezed the trigger. She must have caught the man somewhere in the middle, for he let out a loud scream of pain as he doubled over. He fell to the floor with a loud thud. She won that round, she told herself, though the battle went to Ice. Jade was surrounded by three men. When the first reached for her, she cut his hand with her knife. The second villain grabbed her weapon just as the third slammed his fist into the side of her jaw. The blow felled her to the floor in a dead faint. Jade didn\u0027t wake up again until she was being carried inside a dark, damp building. There were only a few candles lighting the area but quite enough for Jade to see the crates stacked up along the stone walls. At the end of the long corridor stood a woman dressed in white. Lady Briars was there, waiting for her. The man carrying her dropped her when he\u0027d reached his leader. Jade staggered to her feet. She rubbed the sting in her jaw while she stared at her adversary. The look in those eyes was chilling. \"I understand now why you were given the name Ice,\" she heard herself say. \"You don\u0027t have a soul, do you, Lady Briars?\" Jade was rewarded by a sound slap across her face. \"Where are the letters?\" Briars demanded. \"Safe,\" Jade answered. \"Do you really believe stealing the letters back is going to save you? Too many people know what you\u0027ve done. Too many . . .\" \"You fool!\" Briars shouted. There was such strength, such cruelty in her voice that Jade suddenly felt as though she were facing the devil. She resisted the urge to cross herself. \"I will have those letters, Jade. They are my proof to the world of all the glorious feats I\u0027ve accomplished. No one\u0027s going to deny me now. No one. In years to come, the world will realize what my Tribunal was able to accomplish. We could have ruled England, if I had chosen to continue with my work. Oh yes, I will have the letters back. They will be kept in a safe place until the time is right to reveal my genius.\" She was mad. Jade could feel the goose bumps on her arms. She tried desperately to think of a way to reason with the woman before she finally came to the conclusion that the crazed woman was beyond any kind of reason. \"If I give you the letters back, will you leave Caine alone?\" she asked. Lady Briars let out a high-pitched snicker. \"If? Don\u0027t you have any idea who I am? You can\u0027t possibly deny me, Jade.\" \"Oh, I know who you are,\" Jade replied. \"You\u0027re the woman who killed my father. You\u0027re the woman who betrayed her country. You\u0027re the foul creature who was born from the devil. You\u0027re the demented . ..\" She quit her tirade when Briars hit her again. Jade backed up a space, then straightened her shoulders. \"Let Caine go, Briars, and I will get you the letters.\" In answer to that promise, Briars turned to one of her cohorts. \"Lock our guest in the back room,\" she ordered. She turned to Jade then. \"You\u0027re going to be the bait, my dear, to get Caine here. He has to die,\" she added in a singsong voice. \"But only after he\u0027s given me the letters, of course. Then I shall kill you, too, little Jade. Your father was the true traitor, for he turned his back against me. Me! Oh, how I wished I could have been there when his son died. You will have to make up for that regret, dear, dear child, by dying slowly by my hand . . . Get her out of here!\" Briars ended in a near shout. Jade felt like weeping with relief. They hadn\u0027t taken Caine after all. He would come for her, she knew, and there was still danger . . . but he was safe for the moment. She actually smiled to herself when they led her to her temporary prison. They believed they had her now. They mustn\u0027t tie her hands, she thought to herself. Jade started whimpering so that her captors would believe she was frightened. As soon as they opened the door, she rushed inside, then collapsed on the floor in the center of the room, and began to cry. The door slammed shut behind her. She kept up her wailing until the sound of footsteps faded. Then she took inventory. Moonlight filtered in through the gray filmed window. The opening was a good fifteen feet up. There was only one piece of furniture, an old scarred desk with only three legs, and they certainly knew she wouldn\u0027t be able to reach the window even if she stood on top of the desk. Yes, they thought they had secured her inside. Jade let out a little sigh of pleasure. She pulled the special clip from her hair that she used for just such an occasion, and went to work on the lock. Because she was in such a desperate hurry to get to Caine before Briars\u0027 men did, she wasn\u0027t as quick as she would have been under calmer circumstances. It took her a little over ten minutes to work the lock free. It was pitch black inside the warehouse proper. Even though Jade was certain Briars had taken all her men with her, she still made her exit as quietly as possible. Jade was completely disoriented when she reached the street. She ran in one direction for two long blocks before she got her bearings and realized she\u0027d taken the wrong way. Jade was in absolute terror now. She knew it was going to take her another fifteen minutes to reach home. While she ran, she made several fervent promises to her Maker. She gave him her word that she would never lie or steal again, if he would only keep Caine safe. \"I know you gave me those special talents, Lord, and you know that once I give my word, I won\u0027t break it. I won\u0027t follow in my father\u0027s path, either. Just let me live long enough to prove myself. Please, God? Caine needs me.\" She had to stop when the stitch in her side intensified. \"If you\u0027ll only give me a little added strength, Lord, I won\u0027t use blasphemies either.\" Odd, but the stitch in her side faded. She was able to catch her breath, too. That last promise must have been the one her Maker was waiting to hear, she decided. \"Thank you,\" she whispered as she picked up her skirts again and started running. Jade didn\u0027t stop again until she reached the street their town house was located on. She kept to the shadows as she made her way toward the steps. When she spotted three men littering her stoop, she started running again. The men weren\u0027t in any condition to waylay her. They looked restful too, in their forced slumber.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-44.html","bookId":1791,"book":{"id":1791,"title":"Guardian Angel (Crown\u0027s Spies #2)","description":"Storyline: The Emerald flew across the seas, carrying the pirate Pagan -- despised by the ton, whose riches he plundered, and beloved by the poor, whose plight was eased by his gifts.
